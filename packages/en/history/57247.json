Preposterous. It would\r\ninvolve making a yellow man think as a white man, and that had never\r\noccurred, not even in the case of the prodigy, Japan. It would involve\r\nfree intercourse with the whole wide world, and China had opposed such\r\nan innovation stubbornly for 400 years. It meant that the proudest\r\nand most self-contained nation should treat others as equals and\r\ninterchange with them. It involved throwing 4,000 years of continuous\r\nhistory and agglomerated pride and precedent to the winds, and humbly\r\nbeginning anew as a tyro for a while. It meant the dealing with\r\n400,000,000 kings, instead of one, and asking: “My lord, what is your\r\nwill?” An educational system 2,000 years old to be forgotten at once!\r\nA religion 5,000 years old at least, whereby every man had his own god\r\n(his father), to be made as cheap as the paltry sacrifices of wine,\r\nrice and the painted stick of Confucianism were in reality! The taking\r\nup of individual and national responsibility for 400,000,000 people,\r\nand entrance upon a wide path of world-influence, with its divided\r\nshame and fame! The taking and giving of blows for wrong and right!\r\nThe giving up of the triple eternal Nirvana of father, self and son,\r\nin exchange for an exciting rôle limited to fifty-five crowded years\r\nin the individual! The scale of action! A land as large as all Europe,\r\nand a people as numerous as the Caucasic race! The thunderous knock on\r\nthe long-locked doors of science and medicine by 400,000,000 people who\r\nhad bowed to idol and charm alone! It shook the world. It was pregnant\r\nwith paradisal possibilities for mankind, because of the vastness of\r\nthe movement and the depth of its well-spring. The launching of this\r\nnew leviathan ship of state could not but raise a wave that would\r\nlift the already floating hulks of Europe and America, and give them\r\nadded impetus, though temporary alarm. The rearrangement of commerce,\r\nmanufacture, labor, finance, taxation, learning, agriculture, art and\r\npossibly religion for the whole world. The adding of the most difficult\r\nlanguage to the tongues and pens of men, and the call on the English\r\nspeech to rise once more greater than the mighty stranger, or die.\r\nThe challenge to Palestine’s Bible to conquer by truth, or retreat\r\nwith half a world lost. The uprising again of the yellow ghosts of\r\nKublai Khan, Batu, Timurlane, and the Khans of the Golden Horde. What\r\nwould be the Caucasian’s answer to Emperor William’s question: “The\r\nYellow Peril”? It will be remembered that the kaiser once painted a\r\npicture showing the nations of Europe gathering to defend the cross\r\nand civilization against an incendiary Buddha lowering in the eastern\r\nsky. Would the stranger within the gates be protected even while\r\nrepublican and imperialist fought out their argument? Would leadership\r\narise, and would the great Mongolian mass be intellectualized now\r\nthat it was energized? Since the vast body was suddenly displaced,\r\nwould it henceforward move by mere gravity, or sympathetic volition?\r\nCould it collectivize and not disintegrate? What would be the effect\r\non the scores of trembling thrones, where Rominoff, Hapsburg, Savoy,\r\nHohenzollern, Ottoman, Mikado, Billiken, etc., said they ruled by\r\n“divine right”, which is quite a different thing from noble England’s\r\n“constitutional right”? Sun Yat Sen and the Chinese republicans sent\r\nout this challenge: “Tien ming wu chang” (the divine right lasts not\r\nforever).\r\n\r\nAll these questions presented themselves when the reformers startled\r\nthe world with the announcement that there was to be a republic in\r\nChina. It was to be a republic--not a monarchy--said even those\r\nChinese who had been educated in Japan, where lately a Japanese editor\r\neducated in America and ten others had been tried and executed in\r\nsecret, the papers sealed, and the press censored. They wanted pitiless\r\npublicity in the new republican China. Had there been no abatement\r\nof the opium habit through America’s leadership of sentiment, and\r\nBritain’s sacrifice of revenue from 1909 to 1911, there could have\r\nbeen no rebellion in 1911. The reform cleared the befogged heads of\r\nthe nation, added a million men to agitation, and furnished a hundred\r\nmillion dollars directly and indirectly toward the independence of the\r\nagitators. How great a stone America and Britain set rolling in that\r\nOpium Conference of 1909 at Shanghai!\r\n\r\nThe great revolution of October, 1911, did not drop as a bolt from\r\na clear sky. The clouds had been gathering, though many at home\r\nand abroad did not, or would not see them. In September, 1911, the\r\nimperial viceroy of Canton, Chang Ming Chi, sent spies along the new\r\nCanton-Hongkong railway to apprehend smugglers of arms. In the same\r\nmonth troops under the command of Marshal Lung Chai Kwong, suddenly\r\nsurrounded the office of the _Shat Pat Po_ newspaper, at Canton, and\r\narrested several reformers. General Luk Wing Ting, of Kwangsi province,\r\ncame down the Si Kiang (West River) in September, 1911, in the gunboat\r\n_Po Pik_ to Canton and took back with him from the Canton arsenal,\r\nmachine guns and ammunition to attack the “anarchists”, as the Manchus\r\npersistently called all reformers. In the month previous, the Ministry\r\nof Posts and Communications at Peking stopped the use of private codes,\r\nso as to censor messages to the reformers. Several viceroys, in secret\r\nsympathy with the reformers, had as early as August, 1911, wired for\r\ngunboats, so as to disperse the fleet from the Yangtze basin, where the\r\nrevolution was to strike, and the largest cruiser, the splendid _Hai\r\nChi_, well-known in New York, these viceroys suggested should be sent\r\nto King George’s coronation review at Spithead. Even as far back as\r\nJuly, 1907, the Chinese government approached the powers, requesting\r\nthat they make espionage on arms consigned to South China. Rather\r\nto our amusement, they used to arrive at Hongkong as boxed pipes,\r\ncondensers, bar iron, crockery, etc.--anything but guns, but that was\r\nthe humor of the freight classification which the shippers used! In\r\nDecember, 1906, the scholars of the middle class in Wuchow, Kwangsi\r\nprovince, at the head of navigation on the West River, decided to cut\r\noff their queues, and adopted khaki uniform, military drill and track\r\nraces. They were independently preparing for strenuous times five years\r\nbefore the outbreak, and these boys were found in the first line of\r\nthe attack in October, 1911, up at Hankau, led by the Chinese Colonel\r\nWen, who had graduated from West Point Military Academy, in America, in\r\n1909. In August, 1911, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation\r\nreported that a large part of its $9,000,000 gold note issue was being\r\nheld, instead of circulated by the Chinese of Kwangtung and other\r\nsouthern provinces. This hoarding of safe securities always indicates\r\nlack of faith as to the business and political future.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Manchu, Tuan Fang, director-general of railways, was\r\nordered by the Ministry of Communications to proceed to Canton and\r\nKung Yik, the new town of the Americanized Chinese, in August, 1911,\r\nto “pacify the people”. Tuan replied that he would not go, and gave\r\nas his excuse: “Canton is infested with anarchism”. In the same month\r\nthe regent, Prince Chun, asked Prince Ching to recommend an energetic\r\ngeneral to be sent to quell disturbances in Kwangtung province, and\r\nthe Tartar general, Fung Shan, was sent. Spying was not uncommon,\r\nimpersonators going to a province ahead of new appointees and reciting\r\na record at the yamen which seemed to identify them. In August, 1911,\r\nthe cabinet at Peking decided to send photographs of new officials in a\r\nsealed envelope, so as to prevent this impersonating.\r\n\r\nAs an indication of the new spirit which was moving among the Chinese\r\nof Canton for better things at this time, take the inception of the\r\nmodel town of Heungchow. Chinese returned from America, Singapore\r\nand Hongkong could not bear the municipal restraint of the old city.\r\nThey chose a site ten miles up the inner harbor of Macao. Dredging\r\nand a breakwater were begun for a harbor. Broad streets, drains, fine\r\nstores, temples, police and fire stations and equipment, water-works,\r\nlibraries, parks, reforestation, chamber of commerce, tramways,\r\nelectricity and gas, hospitals, schools, theaters, detached homes with\r\ngardens, launch and steamer lines, and a free port,--all were in the\r\nscheme. When a government permits monopoly of food, and riots result\r\nbecause of justice ineffectually exerted, history shows that the\r\ngovernment is about to fall. I instance the fierce Hangchow rice riots\r\nof July, 1906, under the leadership of the Hung Pang (Red Association),\r\nand the Changsha rice riots of 1910, when Yale College, in China, was\r\nbarely saved from the conflagration in the very district which in 1911\r\nwas swept by the high tide of the revolution. In 1906 text-books were\r\nissued to the modern schools (Hok Tongs) which contained a caricature\r\nof China, not as the “Middle Kingdom” of old, but as a morsel from\r\nwhich all the nations took a bite. The intent, of course, was to arouse\r\nresentful patriotism in place of the old inert pride. Many of these\r\nschoolboys enlisted in the two bravest corps of the republicans, the\r\n“Dare to Die” band, and the “Bomb Throwers” regiment. In April, 1911,\r\nthe rebels, under two of Sun Yat Sen’s lieutenants, Hu Wai Sang and Wu\r\nSum, operating in Kwangtung province, issued to the world almost the\r\nidentical manifesto that President Sun and Foreign Secretary Wu Ting\r\nFang issued in January, 1912, covering the following points:\r\n\r\n1. Ousting the Manchu.\r\n\r\n2. Friendly intercourse with foreigners and protection of foreign\r\nproperty and person.\r\n\r\n3. All foreign treaties now in force to be allowed to run their course.\r\n\r\n4. Foreign loans and indemnities contracted by Manchus to date to be\r\npaid.\r\n\r\n5. Concessions contracted to date to be binding.\r\n\r\nDesperate fighting took place, and had the rebels been sufficiently\r\nsupplied with money and arms, the republic would have been declared\r\nat Canton in April instead of at Wuchang and Nanking in November. The\r\nUnited States gunboat _Wilmington_ and British gunboats were rushed\r\nto Shameen Island, Canton, to protect foreigners. Admiral Li, who was\r\nkilled in the October revolution, was barely able to conquer this\r\nApril revolution in Kwangtung and Fukien provinces. For centuries the\r\nChinese women would not associate with the Manchus, whom they called\r\n“tent women”. All through Turkestan the Chinese walled off their\r\nsection of the city from the Mongolian settlements, though after the\r\nconquest the Manchu troops displaced the Chinese.\r\n\r\nNearly all the missions were informed by students and friends\r\nmany months previous to the revolution that serious and continued\r\ndisturbances would occur. The Chinese saw that individualism had\r\narisen in America and England and was battling with the privileged.\r\nIndividualism arose at last in China and resented in this rebellion\r\nthe quietism taught by the superstition of Taoism, the resignation\r\nof Buddhism and the obedience of Confucianism. “I am not a clan; I\r\nam a man,” said the ambitious Chinese as he saw the new ray of hope.\r\nAmerican diplomacy was not altogether uninformed or unprepared. The\r\nAmerican fleet was made the largest foreign fleet in Chinese waters in\r\nthe first month of the revolution, Admiral Murdock having the cruisers\r\n_Saratoga_ (the converted _New York_ of Spanish War fame), _Albany_,\r\n_New Orleans_, _Wilmington_; the gunboats _Helena_, _El Cano_,\r\n_Villalobos_, _Samar_; the monitor _Monterey_; and the destroyers\r\n_Barry_ and _Decatur_.\r\n\r\nAs far back as June 3, 1910, a year and four months before the\r\nrevolution, the Shanghai _News_ printed the following article: “All\r\nthe legations and consuls have received anonymous letters from\r\nfriendly revolutionaries in Shanghai containing the warning that an\r\nextensive anti-dynastic uprising is imminent. If they do not assist\r\nthe Manchus, foreigners are not to be harmed.” In August, 1911, a\r\nrebellion broke out at Sining, in far western Kansu province. The\r\nstores were raided for every bolt of foreign cotton to make uniforms.\r\nA boy of fifteen was named leader and he was given the significantly\r\nfanciful name of “Savior of his country” (Chiu Shih Wang). Rich men\r\ncornered the rice supply in the flooded Yangtze valley, and food\r\nriots broke out all along the river in August, 1911. On August 23,\r\n1911, rebels boarded a Chinese gunboat on the romantic Si Kiang (West\r\nRiver) near Canton, shooting the commander and seizing the arms and\r\nammunition. On September first the Navy Department strengthened the\r\npatrol of Kwangtung province waters so as to stop the smuggling of\r\narms, and the army board required miners to get permits to import\r\ndynamite, as they feared that the “anarchists” were importing the\r\nexplosive. The awful floods and famines of 1910–11 in the basins of\r\nthe Yangtze River, the Hwei River and Grand Canal had created much\r\ncriticism of the government, which failed to alleviate suffering;\r\nand the famine-stricken were willing to fight, because an army has a\r\ncommissariat, at least. “Every one that was in distress, and every\r\none that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, escaped to\r\nthe cave of Adullam.” Newspapers, such as the oldest reform journal,\r\nthe _Shen Pao_, of Shanghai, related horrible illegal tortures of the\r\n“third degree” used by Manchuized officials, which I have quoted in the\r\nchapter on “Legal Practise.”\r\n\r\nTin was largely financing the propaganda, the 400,000 Chinese tin\r\nmerchants and miners of Singapore and Penang in the Straits Settlements\r\nbeing the largest contributors. Following them came the 100,000\r\nAmerican Chinese and the 50,000 Australian Chinese. Even in 1898, Li\r\nHung Chang was known to declare, at Canton, that it was not impossible\r\nthat the spread of the proposed new education of the foreigners would\r\noverturn the Manchu dynasty, of which he, a Chinese from Hofei, in\r\nNganhwei province, had been the strongest prop among the viceroys for\r\nforty-five years. Superstition was not inactive. Halley’s comet flared\r\nin the sky. It had shone when Cæsar fell; when Jerusalem fell; when\r\nItaly fell before Attila; when English Harold fell before William the\r\nConqueror; when Rome fell in England; when Quebec fell before Wolfe;\r\nand now its awful flame must surely prophesy the fall of the Manchu\r\ndynasty. Omens were recited that red snow (snow and loess) had fallen\r\nin Honan province, and that the Hangchow tidal bore had risen twenty\r\nfeet, broke over the bank and poured water into the first gallery of\r\nthe Haining pagoda. This always meant the fall of the dynasty, for\r\nhad it not happened on the night the beloved Mings fell, and when the\r\nscholarly Sungs fell?\r\n\r\nAs with civil servants in some other countries, the Manchuized civil\r\nservice (mandarins) acted as though they were the governors and not\r\nthe servants of the people by allotting to themselves high salaries\r\nand peculations. The year before the revolution the land tax yielded\r\nabout $150,000,000. Only $30,000,000 reached the government exchequer.\r\nThe Chinese held the Manchus responsible for this criminal neglect\r\nof audit, for at least $100,000,000 should have reached the imperial\r\nand provincial exchequers. That would have allowed $50,000,000 for\r\nthe expected peculation of that kind of office holders who believe\r\nthat “public office is a private graft”. In September, 1911, the\r\nmonth preceding the great revolution, the _Chi Feng Po_, a native\r\npaper of Peking, reported that all wages were in arrears and that\r\neven the tea coolies had humorously pasted an anonymous sheet on the\r\nimperial controller’s door: “Not even a shadow of our wages yet; WHY!\r\nWHY!” Taxes were increased on long-suffering Kwangtung province in\r\nthe south, the brick kilns of Kochau, the silk sheds of Namhoi, the\r\ntea houses, and even the temple keepers being assessed “all the taxed\r\nwould bear”. I shall instance a representative revolt. On September 6,\r\n1911, the bonze at Shek Lung, near Canton, organized a revolt among the\r\nworshipers at his temple. The mob demolished the municipal yamen, the\r\npolice station, the government distilleries, abattoir and fish market.\r\nAs far back as 1898 the emperor, Kwang Hsu, by edict declared that the\r\nlottery at Canton should pay one-third of the upkeep of the far-away\r\nPeking University. I have related in the chapter on “Chinese Daily\r\nLife” the incident of a unique statue of a kneeling figure erected in\r\nthe Kwan clan temple at San Wui, near Canton, in August, 1911, which is\r\nwhipped by the worshipers to commemorate the defection of a member to\r\nthe government’s railway and tax program. There was always ill feeling\r\nbetween Peking and Kwangtung provinces, the Manchu and Manchuized\r\nviceroys joking at Peking when they were ordered to assume charge at\r\nthe yamen at Canton: “Well, I’m off to boss Miaotszes (barbarians),”\r\nwhich the refined and commercial Cantonese certainly were not. This\r\nsuperciliousness was deeply resented.\r\n\r\nRepeated complaint had been made that an unrepresentative Manchu\r\ngovernment gave away concessions right and left to foreigners, and\r\nthat when these concessions were recalled or bought out, owing to\r\noutraged patriotic feeling in the southern and central provinces,\r\nthe foreigner in instances charged immense sums for good will and\r\nfranchise in addition to his outlay and interest. I shall not recite\r\ninstances, as it is the system that I am denouncing, not the persons.\r\nThe Chinese rightly said, if we look at the matter with his eyes, that\r\nhe was not going to pay vast sums for the retrocession of his own\r\nfranchise, which was in some instances coerced from, or wheedled out\r\nof, an effete, governing, unrepresentative clique, the members of which\r\nnever consulted the provinces that were concerned. “Taxation without\r\nrepresentation” again. It was not like the repudiation of the bonds\r\nof the southern states, for no money had been paid. “Compensation”\r\nand “indemnity” are two words the Chinese have learned to hate, and\r\nsome day they mean to build an immense navy and equip a large army to\r\ninterpret these words in the way the Occident interprets them, when\r\nthey are synonymous with injustice and “grab”. Bitter complaint has\r\ncontinually been made since 1898 that Germany monopolized the mining\r\nand railway franchises of the rich province of Shangtung.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of railways, concessions, etc., the following remarks\r\nwill be recalled in the American General J. H. Wilson’s book, _China_\r\n(1887): “The Chinese will build railroads, open mines, etc., whenever\r\nthey can be shown that this can be done with their own money, obtained\r\nat first by private subscription, and by their own labor, under the\r\ndirection of foreign experts who will treat them fairly and honestly.\r\nThey will not for the present grant concessions or subsidies to\r\nforeigners. They will not even take money from any syndicate by\r\nmortgage.” Complaint was also made that the Ming dynasty, 268 years\r\nago, left as a heritage to the Manchu dynasty, a land full of public\r\nworks, bridges, roads, temples, pagodas, canals, and that while the\r\nManchu collected large taxes, he seldom or never repaired a temple,\r\ncanal or road, so that China is now desolate. Objection was also made\r\nthat the government shipyards, like the Kiangnan, at Shanghai, were\r\nbuilding luxurious ocean steam yachts for Prince Tsui and others of the\r\nimperial clan, an expense which the nation could not afford.\r\n\r\nTwo years before the famous revolution of October 10, 1911, the\r\nauthor, in his book, _The Chinese_, picked out five men as the leaders\r\nof changing China: Sun Yat Sen, as the anti-Manchu rebel, who would\r\ntake up arms in the endeavor to establish a republic; Kang Yu Wei,\r\nwho would go almost as far in reform, but would retain the Manchu\r\ndynasty under a strict constitutional monarchy; Liang Chi Chao, as\r\nthe translator of reform books and a probable secretary of a reformed\r\nstate; Wu Ting Fang, as a secret reformer at heart, “who would bear\r\nsympathetic watching”, and Yuan Shih Kai, to a degree an Occidentalized\r\nopportunist of great ability, who was most favored by the Peking and\r\nTientsin foreigners, though distrusted by the Chinese and foreigners\r\nin the south and Yangtze valley of China. The revolution was in full\r\nsway by November, 1911, with Sun Yat Sen named as probable president\r\nof a Chinese republic (Republic of Han); Kang in the exact place\r\nprophesied; Liang as secretary of justice of Yuan’s first trial cabinet\r\nof a constitutional monarchy; Wu Ting Fang as foreign minister of a\r\nprovisional republic at Shanghai; and Yuan called from his two years’\r\nexile at Chang Te in Honan province to be the first minister of the\r\nreformed constitutional monarchy.\r\n\r\nThis most wonderful of revolutions seemed to break as a bolt from a\r\nclear sky on October 10, 1911, at Wuchang on the Yangtze River, in the\r\ncenter of the land, under the very guns of the United States gunboats\r\n_Helena_ and _Villalobos_ which were steaming by. It was, as I have\r\nattempted to show, rather a carefully planned matter, the propaganda\r\ngoing on abroad and at home under bands and leaders, all of whose views\r\ndid not stop at the same place, but whose opinions had one source\r\nin patriotic reform. Kang, the oldest and first of the reformers,\r\ncommenced in 1897 by winning with his book, _Japan’s Reform_, the\r\nemotional Manchu emperor, Kwang Hsu. But when the emperor fell in\r\n1898 before the reactionary dowager, Tse Hsi, Kang, the Cantonese with\r\na Hongkong education, was driven to British Singapore and Penang,\r\nfrom which places he has planned his travels and propaganda of the\r\n“Pao Huang Hwei” (Empire Reform Association), which contemplated a\r\nrevolution of reform, but the retention of the Manchu dynasty as\r\nconstitutional monarchs for the time being. This association was quite\r\ndifferent from the Kao-lao-hwei, “Ko Ming” and “Sia Hwei” (reform\r\nassociations) of Sun Yat Sen, which aimed at a republic. In other words\r\nKang was a Taft “standpatter” medium reformer, and Sun a thorough-going\r\nadvanced reformer of the Roosevelt type. Kang’s associations grew up\r\nin China, America and England, and Kang visited them, recommending the\r\ndrilling of companies to attack the troops of the reactionary literati\r\nof the Hanlin academy.\r\n\r\nLiang Chi Chao, the writer and translator, went first to the Straits\r\nSettlements and then to Kobe and Yokohama, Japan, where he edited the\r\nreform Chinese papers, the _Hsi Pao_ (Western paper), and the _Ming\r\nPao_, and flooded his country with translations of parts of the great\r\nbooks of British and American liberty. Liang, too, tolerated the\r\nretention of the Manchu monarchs for the time being. Doctor Macklin, an\r\nAmerican missionary of Nanking had translated Henry George’s _Progress\r\nand Poverty_ into Chinese, and this book was in the hands of the\r\nreformers, and particularly appreciated by Sun Yat Sen. Chang Yuan\r\nChi’s _Commercial Press_ of Honan Road, Shanghai, had, since 1898, been\r\ntranslating a million dollars a year of Western text-books for Chinese\r\nschools. The American Presbyterian Press at Suchow, and at 18 Peking\r\nRoad, Shanghai, the American Episcopal Press, the presses of the other\r\nAmerican and British missions and Bible societies, had for years been\r\nissuing telling books of truth in Chinese. Rich compradores of foreign\r\nhouses at Hongkong, like Ma Ying Pui, presented $1,000 to patriotic\r\nlecturing societies like the “Wan Yung.” Hæmon’s argument with his\r\nfather, King Creon, in Sophocles’ _Antigone_, brilliantly denouncing\r\nabsolute rule as only fitted for the monarch of a desert, was recited\r\nby the foreign-trained students.\r\n\r\nYuan Shih Kai was deposed by the regent, Prince Chun, in 1909, but from\r\nhis exile at Chang Te in Honan province, he kept in dignified touch\r\nwith the formation of the new forces of opinion and arms, and with\r\nhis backers, the northern foreigners. Yuan is a mighty man, quite on\r\nthe style of Li Hung Chang, his preceptor, whom we of the West knew\r\nso well. At Tientsin, the foreigners assisted Yuan, previous to 1909,\r\nwith instruction in Occidental organization, and the best troops of\r\nthe empire, as well as the best schools, and almost the best mills,\r\nwere organized by Yuan. The reformers who dare the most, however,\r\nlook upon Yuan by his past, as a temporizer, opportunist and dictator\r\nlargely under foreign influence; too much Occidentalized, and out\r\nof touch with the spirit of “China for the Chinese”, and the “Sia\r\nHwei” (reform associations). They look upon him as, in the past, a\r\nManchuized Chinese who fears to work for himself as a republican, but\r\nmust have an employer like a Manchu emperor or some other head; great\r\nas a Richelieu is great, but not as a Washington is great. They say\r\nthat while he is thorough of mind, he is not yet vehemently sincere\r\nin heart. They fear that Yuan, if left to himself, would concede too\r\nmuch to foreign concession seekers. They bitterly recall that but for\r\nYuan, the reformers of 1897–8 would have swept the kingdom peacefully.\r\nYuan is the most popular Chinese with foreigners at Peking, Tientsin,\r\nChifu, Newchwang, Tsingtau and other ports of the north. He is not so\r\nmuch in touch with the heart of the reform spirit in Western, Central\r\nor Southern China, nor with the foreigners of the great educational\r\ntreaty ports of those sections, and of the brilliant British colony of\r\nHongkong in South China, which, with British and American Shanghai,\r\nhas done most for a reformed China. Yuan’s only experience outside\r\nof China proper was when as a youth he served twelve years with the\r\narmy in Korea. Yuan’s temperament is cold. A noted southern statesman,\r\nreferring to him, said: “What can you expect of a man who is so cold\r\nthat he has to carry three braziers up his sleeve?” In the Korean\r\ncampaign of 1884 against Japan, Yuan is said to have objected to Red\r\nCross operations, jesting that the surgeons didn’t need to take the\r\ntrouble, for “while they had remade the man, they hadn’t remade the\r\nsoldier”. Yuan was a ruthless decapitator in that and other campaigns.\r\nHowever, “to err is human, and to forgive, divine”, and if Yuan serves\r\na united republican China with full heart in the future, the mistakes\r\nof the past will be forgotten in the joys of the glorious deeds that\r\nare possible.\r\n\r\nDoctor Sun Yat Sen (let us Latinize him as Sunyacius) is a Hongkong\r\nproduct, and has been a revolutionist and a republican from the\r\nbeginning. As a boy he was fed on thrilling stories of the Taiping\r\nrebellion by his uncle, who had served as an officer in that rebellion.\r\nHe was born at Fatshan, seven miles west of Canton, in 1866. From\r\n1884–87 he was assisted by Doctor Kerr, of the Anglo-American Mission,\r\nCanton, in whose office he studied medicine and English. He studied\r\nmedicine and surgery under Doctor Cantlie at Hongkong, of which colony\r\nhe became a citizen (that is, a British citizen), though of course,\r\nhe has now returned to his Chinese citizenship. Doctor Cantlie was\r\nthen teaching in the Hongkong School of Medicine, which is now a part\r\nof the Hongkong University. In 1892 Sun became the first Chinese\r\npractising physician at Macao, and met with great opposition from the\r\nPortuguese doctors, who, in 1894, drove him to Canton. His father was\r\na Chinese Christian evangelist, a Congregationalist (London Mission)\r\nby denomination, and Sunyacius looks upon the study of the Christian\r\nBible as the greatest necessity in China’s education. Even two years\r\nbefore Kang’s work at Peking, Doctor Sunyacius, in 1895, smuggled\r\narms into Canton, got his revolutionary forces at work, and received\r\nhis first baptism of fire, in which he showed, as on subsequent\r\noccasions, absolute fearlessness regarding his life. Sunyacius also\r\nlived for a while with his brother and sympathizers in Honolulu, and\r\nhis studies in Hawaii and in America committed him to the republican\r\nform of government. Owing to the Swatow men not meeting the Hongkong\r\nmen at Canton, Sunyacius’ plans collapsed in 1895. By the advice of\r\nMr. Dennis, a prominent solicitor of Hongkong, Sunyacius fled to Kobe,\r\nJapan; to Honolulu and to San Francisco. This incisive, good-looking\r\nlittle man of about five feet five inches in height, who dresses and\r\nlooks like an American or a Briton, has for years been traveling\r\nincognito in America, England and Japan, organizing drill, educational\r\nand contributing corps of the “Kao Lao Hwei” (reform associations), the\r\nmoney and men going to Canton, Shanghai and Wuchang, where the main\r\nrevolution broke out on that memorable day, October 10, 1911. General\r\nHwang Hing was Sunyacius’ representative in China in receiving this\r\naid. All of Sunyacius’ helpers proved loyal to their trust in handling\r\nthis money, except one, and of him Sunyacius himself writes: “He will\r\nmeet with his due reward.”\r\n\r\nSunyacius’ head carried a price (the modern blacklist) and only his\r\ninsistence on British citizenship saved him from being kidnapped as a\r\nlunatic (no less) by the yellow and white detectives of the Manchus,\r\nto have his ankles crushed under the hammer and his body cut into a\r\nthousand pieces (lin chee) slowly at Peking. He was seized on Portland\r\nStreet in London, in 1896, and hurried to the Chinese Legation.\r\nSunyacius’ rescue came about in this dramatic way: His Hongkong\r\nteacher, Doctor Cantlie, was then practising in London. Sunyacius gave\r\nto a British secretary in the Chinese Legation a note addressed to\r\nDoctor Cantlie, to whom it was fortunately delivered in the British\r\nspirit of fair play and through the pleas of a woman, the Briton’s\r\nwife counseling her husband to deliver the letter in “noble scorn\r\nof consequence”. The heroic Doctor Cantlie at once took it to Lord\r\nSalisbury and the British Foreign Office, which intervened, surrounding\r\nthe Chinese Legation with officers (a new siege of Peking). Sunyacius\r\nwas reluctantly given his freedom by the Manchuized Chinese. Only for\r\nBritain, therefore, Sunyacius would never have lived to strike the\r\ntocsin of a republican revolution. But then, Britain has been the\r\nmother and teacher of reformers since Cromwell’s day.\r\n\r\nSunyacius’ headquarters have been at British Singapore and at Hongkong,\r\nbut he is as well known at San Francisco, Chicago, New York, London,\r\nVancouver and Yokohama. He has walked into dormitories of Columbia\r\nCollege, New York, and talked revolution and reform with some of the\r\nstudents under the unconscious eye of so prominent a conservative as\r\nPresident Butler. One of his student protégés was Wellington Koo, now\r\nthe Chinese secretary to Yuan Shih Kai. Sunyacius is a thorough-going\r\nscholar, propagandist, organizer and republican, like the book he\r\ncarried, a man of “Progress and Poverty”. The world’s great bankers,\r\nespecially two London firms long connected with Chinese progress,\r\nknew him, his disguises as a salesman, etc., and his careful plans\r\nof government and finance, and he has not been timid in America, or\r\nin London, Hongkong and the Straits Settlements in asking for loans\r\nfor his propaganda and revolution. He has handled a million dollars\r\nhonestly, and lived most frugally. The greatest luxury he ever allowed\r\nhimself was a “Prince Albert” coat and a rose-bouttonière, but that was\r\nso that he might appear acceptably before an audience of Occidentals!\r\nWhen in Singapore, Doctor Sun had his picture taken in white ducks\r\nand a topey hat, so that he is a modern in tonsorial as well as other\r\nmatters! “This conference must be secret and our correspondence must\r\nbe anonymous, and upon receipt, burned,” said Sun to the bankers.\r\n“Why?” they asked. “Because I am shadowed night and day. Look across\r\nthe way when I suddenly lift the curtain.” He raised the curtain, and\r\nthe bankers saw two “sleuths” in the cowardly shadow, one of them a\r\nChinese, lurking in a recess of a money capital of the Occident, many\r\nthousand miles from the Manchu cabal in Peking, who had Oriental and\r\nOccidental detective agencies in their blacklisting pay.\r\n\r\nDr. Sun is a brilliant and enthusiastic speaker in Chinese and in\r\nEnglish. His speeches to the Chinese often extend into hours. His\r\nsmall copper-plate handwriting in English is better than his Chinese\r\nchirography. He is a polished writer, having published in 1904 in\r\nLondon a book on “The Chinese Question”. The Manchus have kept Doctor\r\nSun out of China, and he is therefore not yet thoroughly known to the\r\nHupeh and Hunan province guilds, who fired the first successful shot,\r\nbut he is the pick of the southern and the alien Chinese, who are the\r\nbest educated of their race, and have largely financed reform: the\r\nChinese of Canton, Singapore, Penang, noble Hongkong, Macao, America,\r\nEngland, Japan, Australia, and brilliant Shanghai. He has never held\r\noffice under the Manchus at home or abroad, and is therefore not well\r\nknown to foreigners in the salons of diplomats, in the capitals of the\r\nCaucasic race, or to the masses of the Chinese in the north and west\r\nprovinces, but he is a coming man, and perhaps the most consistent\r\nand steady of the reformers, as he is certainly the most promising,\r\nintellectual and coolly daring. Sun Yat Sen’s name may some day be\r\nLatinized into Sunyacius, just as Kung Fut Tse’s name became popular\r\nas Confucius. Why not also Latinize Yuan Shih Kai’s name into the more\r\npopular Yuanshius? The following incident will throw a light on Sun’s\r\ncharacter: On February 22nd his elder brother, Sun Mei, a man ordinary\r\nin equipment, was almost elected governor of the great province of\r\nKwangtung as a popular tribute to Sun Yat Sen. The latter wired from\r\nNanking, disapproving of the choice for the province’s good, and urging\r\n“brother Mei” to confine himself to business, for which he was more\r\nfitted. Such frankness in family relations when public preferment is at\r\nstake, is scarcely common.\r\n\r\nWu Ting Fang, a Cantonese trained at Hongkong, London and Washington,\r\nblossomed out suddenly at Shanghai in November, 1911, as foreign\r\nminister of the provisional Chinese republican government of the\r\nfourteen central, eastern and southern rebel provinces. The western\r\nworld stopped its breath in tremendous astonishment. Wu! the brilliant,\r\nfashionable and evasive Chinese minister at Washington, who would\r\nput you off on politics to discuss vegetarianism, a rebel! He was\r\nsecretive beyond parallel, and had never talked revolution. The writer\r\ntried to get him to talk reform in 1909 in connection with the reform\r\nprophecies in his book, _The Chinese_, and though Wu had then fully\r\ndecided on the part he would take in the coming revolution, he would\r\nonly repeat what the writer said, and would express absolutely no\r\nopinion of his own. I have known writers who have flayed him for this\r\nabrupt evasion, calling him a “rice Christian” of yore, a temporizer,\r\netc., but I admire him for his calmness, fixed resolves, and patience\r\nin waiting for the prodigious hour to strike. Wu knew what was coming,\r\nand was heartily, though secretly, in favor of it. He was the first of\r\nthe rebels to insist on foreign acknowledgment of the rebel government,\r\nand he formulated the most brilliant move of the revolution--the\r\nannouncement that if foreigners advanced money to the imperialists, and\r\nthe republicans won, the latter would repudiate such loans. This really\r\nwon the revolution, for numbers of the foreign syndicates, especially\r\nthe Russian, were at first heartily in favor of the Manchu _status\r\nquo_. Wu has already codified the reform and penal laws of China, and\r\nis prepared to enter upon that difficult question, extraterritoriality.\r\nWatch Wu; he is not afraid to take the side of “China for the Chinese”,\r\nalthough he is the most polished in western culture of all Chinese\r\nofficials. He aims to interpret the East to the West. Wu risked vast\r\npreferment, and therefore he is a more sincere man than doughty Yuan,\r\nand he will grow in power with the masses of the Chinese nation. His\r\nbrother-in-law is the exceedingly able Doctor Ho Kai, Commander of the\r\nOrder of Michael and George, the Chinese member of the Legislative\r\nCouncil of the royal colony of Hongkong Island, a thorough legislator,\r\na lovable and brilliant man. Wu is a member of a worthy Canton family.\r\nHe is a graduate of the Middle Temple, London; has practised before\r\nthe Hongkong bar; and he served Li Hung Chang for many years as legal\r\nadviser at Tientsin and Peking, in drawing up foreign treaties, etc.\r\n\r\nThere were other reformers in China and abroad at work from 1898 to\r\n1911, although the western press gave no attention to the really\r\nastonishing matter. The bitter Hunanese republican rebel, the\r\nirrepressible Hwang Hing, was also exiled by the empress dowager,\r\nTse Hsi, in 1898. He fled to Japan, with a price on his head also,\r\nand could hardly be restrained from calling the psychic moment for a\r\nrevolution into immediate declaration. He was a fast organizer, and\r\nbeing nearer the ground, was in close enough touch with the Chinese of\r\nthe central provinces to be at Wuchang in October, 1911, shortly after\r\nthe first blow was struck. He had much to do with the gentry of the\r\nHupeh and Hunan province guilds, who largely financed and precipitated\r\nthe main revolution. Hwang is considered by the extremists of his party\r\nas presidential timber. He is a fervent talker, and like Sun, the last\r\nman in the world to be an opportunist, which is the great Yuan’s one\r\nfault in the minds of many of the Chinese people. Hwang Hing is the one\r\nreformer who has some Japanese sympathies, on account of his education\r\nin Japan. He was born at Changsha in Hunan, where Yale College has a\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\nIn America the editors of the _Chung Sai Yat Po_, the _Chinese World_,\r\nand _Free Press_ in San Francisco; the Chinese Students’ Club in New\r\nYork (225 East Thirty-first Street), which publishes a journal, and\r\nthe _Chinese Reform News_ in New York, often visited by Sun Yat Sen’s\r\nAmerican representative, Wong Man Su, ably took up the propaganda,\r\nwhich was carried on in their own way by a thousand newspapers which\r\narose throughout China from 1906 onward, first in the treaty ports,\r\nand later in Chinese cities, especially Canton, Hankau and Shanghai.\r\nMuch reference was made to the fact that while China, the largest\r\nOriental country, was without a real parliament, other Oriental\r\ncountries had successfully overthrown despotism and oligarchism, and\r\nhad popular assemblies, which granted some representation in return\r\nfor the privilege of taxation. Japan had a Diet; even black Russia had\r\na Duma; the Filipinos had an Assembly; Turkey had an Assembly; little\r\nPersia had a representative Mejliss; native members had at last been\r\nadmitted into the Viceroy’s Council in India; and Hongkong, with its\r\n500,000 Chinese had long had two Chinese as brilliant members of the\r\nLegislative Council.\r\n\r\nViceroy Seu Ki Yu’s essay of 1866, praising Washington and\r\nrepublicanism as ideal, was reissued and distributed, and had great\r\ninfluence. By 1909 and 1910 the reformers had compelled the Manchus\r\nto heed the howling of the wind, and see the shadow of a cloud, at\r\nleast as big as a man’s hand, on the horizon of internal politics. The\r\ndowager empress, Tse Hsi, and later, Prince Ching, and the regent,\r\nPrince Chun--all Manchus--granted provincial and national assemblies;\r\nbut they were called and considered only “Tsecheng Yuan” (advice\r\nboards), and not legislative bodies in the free and full sense of\r\nthe word. The pensions of the Manchus and bannermen in the various\r\nChinese cities were decreased, and land was offered them so that they\r\nmight enter the industrial body. Many Manchus rebelled, as at Chingtu\r\nCity in September, 1911. Argument increased. The cloud on the horizon\r\ngrew larger. Objection was made to the court’s monopoly of the rich\r\ncopper mines of Yunnan province, and complaint was reiterated that\r\nwhile the southern provinces mainly supported the imperial authority\r\nin taxes paid, these provinces were the least consulted, and the\r\nweakest in representation in any governmental consultations that\r\nwere held at Peking. The government developed the armies and schools\r\nof the three northern provinces of Pechili, Shangtung and Shansi with\r\ntaxes collected mainly in the southern provinces, where the government\r\nneglected schools, police and army divisions. It was hard to get the\r\nStuart kings to call Parliaments, and when at a belated date they did,\r\ncomplaint was louder than ever, for there was something to complain of,\r\nand at last a constitutional place to complain in.\r\n\r\nThese Chinese assemblies gave little representation directly to the\r\nmasses, a high property or high tax qualification debarring them as\r\nin Japan; but the gentry of the guilds, in many cases, espoused the\r\nreform sentiment of the masses, exactly as the Stuart Parliaments did\r\nto the disgust of the Stuarts who hoped for monarchic support, and as\r\nthe barons of the “Magna Charta” did at Runnymede to the disgust of\r\nPlantagenet John. One provincial assembly president we must note at\r\nthis point. He is Tang Hua Lung, of the Hupeh Assembly. When Hankau was\r\ntaken on October 10, 1911, Tang jumped to the front as organizer of\r\nthe first rebel provincial government; the “province of Hupeh of the\r\nRepublic of Han”, with headquarters at Wuchang on the Yangtze River,\r\nthe ancient viceregal capital of the illustrious Chang Chih Tung. With\r\nTang Hua, Sun Yu, brother of Sun Yat Sen, came into prominence. In the\r\nmother province of reform, the most progressive province politically\r\nof all the twenty-one, Kwangtung, Wu Hon Man agitated in his assembly\r\nfor reform, and when the imperial viceroy, Chang Ming Chi, fled to\r\nHongkong, because he could find no other refuge, Wu Hon Man rushed into\r\nthe yamen at Canton with the rebelling Sixteenth, and other regiments,\r\nand took charge of that great province for the republican rebels. In\r\nits nationalization-of-railways scheme, the Manchus confiscated the\r\nKwangtung railways, promising to pay the owners only sixty per cent. of\r\ntheir investment. Title deeds of mines in Kwangtung and other provinces\r\nwere also confiscated by the tyrannical Manchu government.\r\n\r\nChina’s army was a territorial one. Troops raised in this way are\r\nhard to control in local emergencies, but they are easier to recruit,\r\nmobilize, drill and discipline at the beginning than mixed corps. Among\r\nthe Generals of Divisions, transferred from the Navy Department, was Li\r\nYuan Heng, on whom the revolutionaries largely fixed their hopes as the\r\nman trained and true for the real deeds of deadly arms, which make new\r\ngovernments possible. Propaganda and patience are all right in their\r\nplaces, but powder needs a special man of a stern mold, fit to deal\r\nwith merciless and terrible enemies. General Li was one of these men,\r\nand General Hwang, Sun Yat Sen’s special representative at the Hankau\r\nand Hanyang battles, was another. General Ling, on the rebels’ right\r\nwing and the republican commander-in-chief, General Hsu Shao Ching,\r\nat Shanghai, were others. General Li’s proclamation of the “Republic\r\nof Han”, with military headquarters at Wuchang, covered the following\r\npoints:\r\n\r\n    1. Expulsion of the Manchu dynasty.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PROHIBITED ON PAIN OF DEATH\r\n\r\n    2. Injuring foreigners.\r\n\r\n    3. Injuring business by taking advantage of war.\r\n\r\n    4. Rapine, arson and adultery.\r\n\r\n    5. Mobbing.\r\n\r\n    6. Preventing recruiting.\r\n\r\n    7. Withstanding commissariat.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TO BE REWARDED HIGHLY\r\n\r\n    8. Supplying commissariat.\r\n\r\n    9. Supplying ammunition.\r\n\r\n   10. Protecting foreign concessions.\r\n\r\n   11. Protecting foreign missions.\r\n\r\n   12. Spreading republican and reform (Sia Hwei) propaganda.\r\n\r\n   13. Facilitating restoration of business and commerce.\r\n\r\nGeneral Li, a Hupeh man, was the Marlborough of the revolution, a\r\nyoung, dashing, Christian soldier, used to courts, fine-looking, full\r\nof humor, traveled, approachable. General Hsu, as the successful siege\r\nof Nanking was later to prove, was the Grant of the revolution, steady,\r\nreasonable, persistent, a spender of men, a strategist and a pounder.\r\nGeneral Li was educated at the Pei Yang naval colleges at Tientsin and\r\nChifu, and at Japanese military and naval schools at Tokio, Kure and\r\nYokosuka, where the name of China’s one naval hero of the China-Japan\r\nWar, Admiral Ting, of the famous battleships _Chen Yuen_ and _Ting\r\nYuen_, is held in considerable respect. Li passed through the terrific\r\nfire of the naval engagements of the _Yalu_ and _Wei Hai Wei_ in 1894.\r\nHe is a Protestant Episcopalian. He traveled round the world with Li\r\nHung Chang in 1896, so that America and Britain were then entertaining\r\nunawares one of the Washingtons of republican China.\r\n\r\nAs general of the Twentieth Division of the northern army, camped at\r\nLanchow, just east of Peking, was General Chang Shao Tsen (we shall\r\ncall him Chang the First to distinguish him from two other generals\r\nChang of the Manchu camp at Nanking and elsewhere in the northeastern\r\nprovinces). Chang the First was well trained by the revolutionists\r\nin their doctrines of liberty, and was told to watch two camps, the\r\nso-called People’s National Assembly at Peking and the Manchu Court\r\nat Peking. Chang the First was trained in war by Yuan Shih Kai and\r\nthe Manchu general-in-chief, Yin Tchang, both of whom were effective\r\nmen, the former schooled by Tientsin and Peking foreigners, the latter\r\nwell trained in the Austrian ranks and before the line of guards at\r\nBerlin. In old Canton, the mighty stanch Wu Hon Man was president of\r\nthe provincial assembly of Kwangtung province. He, too, was ready\r\nto declare for rebellion, despite the imperial viceroy, Chang Ming,\r\nand the loyal Tartar general, who were quartered on his province. In\r\nthe north, Governor Sun Hao Chi, of classic old Shangtung province\r\n(the home of Confucius), was ready to go over. In the province where\r\nShanghai is located, the president of the assembly, Chang Chien, who\r\nproposes to visit American chambers of commerce, and who is well known\r\nas the host in China of visiting Pacific coast chambers of commerce,\r\nwas more than ready to declare for reform. He, with Wu Ting Fang, was\r\ninsistent on the abdication of the Manchu dynasty and the declaration\r\nof a republic.\r\n\r\nAt Lhasa, in far-away Tibet, was an imperial resident who had been\r\ntrained in reform at Shanghai and in law at Yale College, in America.\r\nHe was the eminent Wen Tsung Yao, destined to be the assistant foreign\r\nminister of the first rebel government, and whose son (a West Point\r\ngraduate) was slated to lead the most daring charges at Hankau and\r\nNanking. Even in the home of the Manchus, at Mukden, Wu Yun Lien, a\r\nChinese immigrant, president of the Manchuria Assembly, was filled with\r\nthe doctrine and ready to declare for reform. Great viceroys, who had\r\nserved China long in official positions under the Manchus, were ready\r\nto go over, but for the most part the radical reformers were new men,\r\nunknown to the world, as the Manchus had naturally never given office\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nMany causes, all important, helped to precipitate the crisis. Sheng\r\nKung Pao and others at Peking, Tientsin and Hankau, both Chinese and\r\nManchus whom foreigners know well, had, partly under foreign advice\r\nand Japan’s example, planned to compel the provinces and the gentry\r\nof the guilds to sell out their many little railroads, a number of\r\nwhich were paying well, to the central government, which intended to\r\nnationalize the railroads quickly under immense loans from the banking\r\nnations of the Occident and Japan. These loans meant to the local\r\ngentry the extinction of distributed small fortunes and opportunities;\r\nconcessions of mines to foreigners, such as the immense gifts of\r\nfranchises to the British “Peking Syndicate” in Shansi province, to\r\nthe London and China syndicate in Hupeh province, to Belgian, German,\r\nFrench, Italian and other syndicates; heavy interest; continuation of\r\nthe unscientific Likin system of customs as a security, and payment\r\nof obnoxious bonuses, as when Hupeh province, under Chang Chih Tung,\r\nin 1904, had to pay a bonus to buy back a Chinese railway concession;\r\nand in 1911, when China had to buy the bonds which represented by an\r\nexcess payment of $3,750,000 a Chinese railroad which existed only on\r\npaper; and as Professor Ross points out in _The Changing Chinese_, when\r\nShansi province had to pay a syndicate over two millions to relinquish\r\nan undeveloped concession in China which cost them almost nothing.\r\nThe bitter complaint, _written in blood_, of the Hunanese of Changsha\r\nCity on this subject is quoted in the New York _Railway-Age Gazette_\r\nof October 13, 1911, and includes this sentence: “When a piece of meat\r\nis in the traitorous railway thief’s mouth, it is hard to take it\r\nout.” All may not agree with the Chinese position, but all should duly\r\nconsider the Chinese side of the question as expressed in their words.\r\n“Peking has betrayed Wuchang,” cried the Hupeh men.\r\n\r\nThere were many more instances from the Sungari to the Yangtze basins,\r\nyea, to the Mekong basin, through 2,500 miles of mine and men, traffic\r\nand trade, of the hard bargain driven by the foreign lender, generally\r\nunder bad foreign advice.\r\n\r\nNo foreign house should ever send a representative to China unless it\r\nis willing to send an enlightened and humane man, who intellectually\r\nappreciates the able Chinese as much as he appreciates the foreigner,\r\nand whose sympathies are equally divided between Cathay and his own\r\nnation. Only such a man can deal fairly and give impartial advice,\r\nwhich alone in the end will win for the foreigner what properly is\r\nhis of the profit and prestige. “Why should we, with the richest\r\nmines on earth; the richest passenger, freight and labor field; with\r\nlands plethoric of water power and grain; and the lowest debt, if\r\nunjust coerced indemnities were wiped out, pay foreigners such immense\r\nbonuses, interest and concessions, discounts and profits to go out of\r\nour country”; rang the cry, not only in Hupeh, Hunan, Szechuen, Shansi\r\nand Kwangtung provinces, but even in native papers printed under the\r\nshadow of the foreign banks on the bund at Tientsin in the north.\r\n\r\nThere was one large meeting of protest held by the Chinese of British\r\nHongkong in the Chui Yin Hotel on September 3, 1911, delegates\r\nattending even from distant Szechuen province. Viceroy Liu Ming Chuan’s\r\nmemorial was recalled: “The wealth of the country is being monopolized\r\nby foreigners”. The Railroad Protective Association, of Chingtu City,\r\nin August, 1911, issued a famous placard in which the four banking\r\nnations in caricature were made to say: “The wealth of the four\r\nprovinces of Szechuen, Kwangtung, Hunan and Hupeh, all is given to\r\nus four foreign nations to swallow down at one gulp”. Chinese men,\r\nwomen and children, bound together before the ancestral graves, are\r\nmade to say: “Bound helplessly; it is unbearable. We are bound in one\r\nbunch to be given to foreigners. Come quickly, friends of the Railroad\r\nProtective Association, and deliver us.” The loot, lying ready for the\r\nsyndicates of the four nations to take away, is pictured as cash money,\r\nbullion sycee, bank bills, and books of China’s Confucian classics and\r\nhistory. Other caricatures were prepared so as to inflame patriotism\r\nin the breasts of the new students, the foreigner being made to say\r\ncynically: “The venal students only want their up-keep, purchased\r\ndiplomas, political office, four chair bearers, free theatricals and\r\nthey’ll hush up. The mask may be brave as a dragon’s head, but the tail\r\nis cowardly as a crawling snake.”\r\n\r\nRemembering that Russia and Japan, in 1896, etc., first sought for\r\nrailway control and then practically occupied the three Manchurian\r\nprovinces, we can understand the patriot’s side of the following\r\narticle objecting to the three nations’ railway loan, published in\r\nChinese in a Hankau paper: “The merchants of Hupeh urge the people to\r\ntake shares in the Szechuen, Canton and Hankau railways. The people of\r\nChina are in a sad plight. Why is China so poor that every foreigner\r\nis eager to come to her aid? You Chinese say you have plenty of money,\r\nbut you are unwilling to loan it. Why do you not use your money to\r\nconstruct these railway lines? If you do not, the foreigners will\r\ncome under false pretenses, destroy your nationality, and cut off\r\nyour supplies. England has used this diabolical system to obliterate\r\nEgypt; otherwise how could she have got it?” Even if a foreign banker,\r\nstatesman or merchant does not fully agree with the local feeling of\r\nthe Chinese, it is wise to look frankly at their side of the argument\r\nin making educational, financial and political plans in the future.\r\n\r\nThere was much complaint also of the private hoards of the Manchu\r\nprinces, both in strong-boxes and in foreign banks. The taxes levied\r\nin the southern provinces mainly supported the empire, and these\r\ntaxes were increased. Something then was brewing, especially in the\r\nsouthern and central provinces. The word went forth, “We are not Boxer\r\nmurderers if we cry China for the Chinese, and it is not fair to put a\r\nstone around China’s neck with indemnities just because you are ahead\r\nof us in possessing fleets. We love the American and British peoples,\r\nand their glorious books on _Liberty_, even if we do not love some of\r\nyour unregulated trusts any more than you and your Supreme Court’s\r\ndecisions do! We are willing to pay a fair rate of interest. Not a\r\nhair of a foreigner is to be touched. We appreciate the education and\r\nlovable alienation of the missionaries, and especially the miracle of\r\nOccidental medicine and surgery.”\r\n\r\nHere is the guarantee of the “Sia Hwei” (reform association), of\r\nFuchau, to the Methodist and other missionaries of Fukien province. “We\r\nhave just heard that the missionaries, on account of the uprising of\r\nthe New China revolutionary associations, with their just cause, have\r\nbeen requested by your foreign consuls to go to the provincial capital,\r\nFuchau, to be protected. The Chinese people have become very much\r\nenlightened and their old customs have changed. The Chinese people and\r\nthe missionaries’ church are at peace, because your church has opened\r\nschools, hospitals, orphanages and similar good institutions. Not one\r\nof these but is held deep in the hearts of the Chinese people. Although\r\nwe are a humble folk, still we have seen and appreciated these things.\r\nThis reform association requests that you missionaries remain at your\r\nposts throughout the province. Should anything unforeseen occur, we\r\nshould, of course, exert ourselves to protect you and your property.\r\nWe are quite sure that we can afford efficient protection from mobs\r\nand imperialists.” These Fukien people were as good as their word,\r\nfor besides sending levies to the revolution, the “hsiang lao” (head\r\nmen) of the villages organized home guards for the protection of both\r\nforeigners and natives. When the revolution broke out at Wuchang, the\r\nsoldiers of the thirtieth regiment escorted the American missionaries\r\nout of the line of fire from Serpent Hill. The American Episcopal\r\nmissionaries crowded aboard the German freighter _Belgravia_, bound for\r\nShanghai, the American gunboat _Helena_, Commander Knepper, standing\r\nby. The revolutionary soldiers of Generals Li and Hwang shouted a peace\r\nmessage: “American republicans are brothers of ours; good-by!”\r\n\r\nA cry went through the vast nation that the Manchu dynasty of usurpers\r\nwas signing away the land with hardly a struggle: Tonquin to France;\r\nFormosa and vast Korea to Japan; rich Manchuria, and possibly Jungaria,\r\nto Russia; Kiaochou to Germany; and so on, even little Portugal wanting\r\nmore of Heungshan Peninsula; the effete nations of Europe, with only\r\npaper ships, “bluffing” like the monster nations, all demanding “your\r\nprovinces or your life”, and getting the provinces. The articles in the\r\nindependent press in America were translated in many instances into\r\nChinese, and the spirit of protest in America, Britain and Germany was\r\nemulated in awakened China. The minority Manchus could not be trusted\r\nto control the Chinese, and “pack” boards (Pus), ministries, and even\r\nassemblies, to suit themselves. Government by “privileged minority”\r\nwas being called in question throughout the earth as unconstitutional;\r\nwhy not in China? There must be true popular government, which the\r\nManchus postponed from month to month with “standpat” doctrines, and\r\nwhile a deliberative body was formed at Peking, the ministries, boards\r\nand the majority of the National Assembly were appointed in “machine”\r\nstyle by the Manchus from their set, which, of course, included many\r\nof the Manchuized Chinese, as well as Manchus and Mongols. The Chinese\r\nofficials--the old literati--are the viceroys, ministers and members of\r\nthe governing boards, whom we foreigners best know. Many of them are\r\nvery able, and some of them love reform, but few of them dared anything\r\nfor the revolution except Wu Ting Fang. Give him that credit as often\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nThe heavy indemnities, amounting to the awful sum of $250,000,000, for\r\nthe massacres of 1900, which the “Boxer” empress dowager, Tse Hsi, a\r\nManchu, approved, have been a heavy load upon the Chinese people of\r\nthe southern and central provinces, who had nothing to do with the\r\npersecution of foreigners. The Chinese of the taxed south greatly\r\nappreciated, therefore, American and British action in returning\r\npart of their indemnities. But other nations should do likewise. The\r\n_Westminster Gazette_, of London, now supports this position.\r\n\r\nHistories of peoples, not dynasties and oligarchies, such as John\r\nRichard Green’s _History of the English People_; books which helped\r\nto bring about the American revolution; the American missionary,\r\nDoctor Macklin’s, Chinese translation of Henry George’s _Progress and\r\nPoverty_; great pæans of liberty and political pain the world over;\r\neditorials from the progressive American press; chapters from American\r\nand English books which sympathized with the Chinese, were translated\r\nand read. The notable book _Service_ was re-read. It was written in\r\n1897 by Tan Sze Tung, the son of a governor of Hupeh province. Tan\r\nwas one of the martyrs of 1898 who were beheaded by the dowager, Tse\r\nHsi. Tan’s book criticized absolute monarchy and recommended reform in\r\npolitics and commerce. Sin Chin Nan, by translating parts of Dickens,\r\nhad shown the Chinese people that the common man endured wrongs\r\nthat should be righted. Thomas Paine’s _The Crisis_, which was read\r\nbefore the American regiments of 1776, was translated to be read to\r\nrevolutionary societies like Sun Yat Sen’s “Ka Ming Tang” and the “Sia\r\nHwei.” Special note was taken of the establishment of a Duma even in\r\noligarchic Russia; the success of the Young Turk party in even such a\r\nterrific oligarchy as Turkey; the successful revolt in Mexico, where a\r\npractical oligarchy gave lands to favorites and would not grant real\r\npopular government; and the representation of the Oriental race in the\r\nlegislative bodies of Hongkong, India, Straits Settlements and the\r\nPhilippines.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary dance was opened in September, 1911, by far western\r\nSzechuen province, Peking issuing this edict in the yellow _Peking\r\nGazette_: “Whoever shall serve us by killing rebels or by capturing and\r\nbinding members of the rebellion party, shall be rewarded regardless of\r\nrules.” The Peking government had practically confiscated the railways\r\nof the Szechuenese, as the paper which they were given in exchange bore\r\nno guarantee of interest, and no reliance was put upon the value of the\r\nsecurity by the provincial gentry, bankers and farmers. When provinces\r\nand states lose confidence in the sincerity of a fixed central\r\ngovernment that is not run by parties, that government totters to its\r\nfall. A national anthem was given to the nation to sing:\r\n\r\n    “May China be preserved!\r\n  In this time of the Manchu dynasty,\r\n  We are fortunate to see real splendor;\r\n    May the heavens protect the imperial family.”\r\n\r\nThe south only sang it in parodies. The railway board (Yuchuan Pu) was\r\nputting through its nationalization-of-railways scheme, in accordance\r\nwith the $50,000,000 gold loan from the syndicates of four of the\r\nbanking nations. To back up arguments, troops were increased under the\r\nvarious generals, Tartar and Manchuized Chinese. Some of these troops\r\nwere from the federal army, northern divisions, and had been trained\r\nby Yuan and General Yin Tchang. Some were provincial viceroys’ troops,\r\ntrained both under foreign and native systems, like the splendid army\r\nof the Yunnan viceroy, Li Chin Hsi. The small railway owners, the small\r\nmine owners, the contractors of man-transportation, the noted farmers\r\nand river men of Szechuen province, were ordered to consent to the new\r\nscheme of a national railway to break across Szechuen province from\r\nIchang to Chingtu, and for other railways in the province. The terms of\r\nthe foreign loan, the price at which the bankrupt federal government\r\nwould pretend to buy out the provincial gentry and guilds, the heavy\r\nnew taxes on the west and south, were all partly explained, and the men\r\nof Szechuen (by blood largely Hupeh and Hunan provinces’ emigrants)\r\nrebelled and “fired the shot that was heard around the world”.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright, American Episcopal Church, Foreign Board, N. Y.\r\n\r\n  The Assembly Hall at Wuchang, where the Eighth Hupeh Division under\r\n    General Li Yuan Heng fired the volley that was heard round the\r\n    world, and ushered in republican China.

By birth, a\r\n    Southern Chinese (Kwangtung province), the type best known to\r\n    foreigners.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA noted, partially loyal Chinese general was shortly put in command\r\nof the imperial troops in the ancient capital, Chingtu. His name was\r\nGeneral Chao Ehr Feng, the famous commander who did the astonishing\r\nthing, both from a religious and military point of view, in 1910, of\r\ndriving the Dalai Lama out of Lhasa and Tibet into Darjeeling, in\r\nIndia, and thus putting Buddhism and its pope at the feet of Confucian\r\nChina. China also brought up her bloodiest general, Tsen Chun Hsuan,\r\ninfamous for putting out the last terrific Mohammedan rebellion in\r\nmountainous Yunnan province of the clouds, in unnecessary rivers of\r\nblood. Foreigners scowled at the employment of this man, and Manchu\r\nChina was a little uncertain. Promises meant nothing to Tsen. He was\r\na man-eating tiger, the bloodiest man in the world, who pretended and\r\nlooked to be nothing else, and was descended from as bloody generals.\r\nPeking meant business, and the railway policy, which was as much a war\r\npolicy, seemed to be going through.\r\n\r\nIt was not long, however, before General Chao’s forces were cooped up\r\nin Chingtu, which was besieged by the rebelling province of Szechuen\r\nunder the leadership of the president of assembly, Pu Tien Chun, and\r\nin the engagements General Chao was captured and decapitated. The\r\nstrategic importance of the railways already built then appeared like\r\nthe flash of a saber at the bare neck of the victim. Modern troops were\r\nhurried down to Hankau by rail in twenty-four hours and up the river\r\nto Ichang by steamer, in the rear and on the flank of the besiegers.\r\nThen something like thunder happened among the divisions which had\r\nbeen mobilized at the triple cities of Wuchang, Hanyang and Hankau.\r\nThe Eighth Division, under General Li Yuan Heng, territorial troops of\r\nthe modern army, hoisted the rebel tri-color sun flag of red, white\r\nand blue over the yellow dragon of the Manchus, put white bands on\r\ntheir arms and rebelled for the new-born republic of Han. They captured\r\nthe leading arsenal, steel and coal plant at Hanyang, the populous\r\ncommercial city of Hankau, and the luxurious viceregal capital of\r\nWuchang on October 13, 1911. This put a high standard on the rebellion,\r\nfor Li was a young well-trained general of the new school, a diplomat,\r\na sturdy man in the field, a patriot who could not be bought and who\r\nwas organizer enough to see that his men were not bought. Admiral\r\nSah, with a fleet of gunboats and small cruisers, aided the imperial\r\ndivisions under the bloody general, Chang Piao Tuan, which tried to\r\nretake the native city of Hankau. Li’s troops, especially his “Dare\r\nto Die” (Pu Pa Tsze) Brigade of shaven round-heads, fought bravely,\r\nalthough their artillery was only equipped with percussion shells, as\r\ncompared with the time-fuse shells brought down from Peking, Tientsin\r\nand Kiaochou to supply the imperial troops. When ammunition ran out,\r\nthe rebel troops used the bayonet charge with reckless daring. It was\r\na new era in fighting in China when yellow men would charge, with\r\nonly cold steel, across an area swept by machine guns. On October\r\n21st, Generals Li and Hwang, with 15,000 ill-equipped rebels, won the\r\nbattle of Kwang Shili in Hupeh against General Yin Tchang, the Manchu\r\nminister of war and commander-in-chief, with 20,000 finely equipped\r\nloyalists. Part of General Li’s force was a section of an army division\r\nwhich had gone over. Others of his new troops were recruited from the\r\nmost famous boatmen of the world, the Szechuen trackers of the wild\r\nrapids and sublime gorges of the glorious Yangtze River, and from the\r\nindefatigable, cheerful mountain coolies of Hupeh province, who are as\r\nagile as a chamois.\r\n\r\nThe propaganda of the rebels now bore fruit in rapid succession. On\r\nOctober 22nd the rebels, under the leadership of Tan Yen Kai, president\r\nof the Hunan Assembly, took Changsha, the capital of Hunan province.\r\nYale College has a branch in this long forbidden city. Hunan has\r\nalways been notable for honest, sturdy, independent men. It is the\r\nproudest province and the sternest in China. “What way Hunan goes,\r\nthat way goes China.” It was the last province to permit missionary\r\nactivity. Nanchang, the capital of Kiangsi province, the land of\r\npottery, was taken on the same day, completing the occupation of the\r\nfour adjoining central Yangtze provinces, which was all that Sun\r\n(Sunyacius) first planned to do, as a beginning and a basis on which\r\nto solicit foreign loans. It was rebellion indeed, and not a riot. The\r\nTartars, Manchus and loyalists fled. New provincial governments were\r\nset up, each with a popular assembly. Peking was desperate, for China\r\nwas almost split in half by the political earthquake. Peking felt sure\r\nthat she held the north, however, with a well-equipped army of about\r\ntwenty divisions. The reformers, however, had breathed into the ear of\r\nthe troops, and pay was overdue in the impoverished condition of the\r\ncentral government.\r\n\r\nOn October 24th, ancient Singan, the capital of the north-western\r\nprovince of Shensi, the original capital of China, where the empress\r\ndowager, Tse Hsi, fled in 1900, went over to the rebels, despite the\r\nthreats of the bloody Mongol governor, General Sheng Yun. This really\r\nmeant a fifth seceding province, as far as the populace was concerned.\r\nOn the same day, Kowkiang on the Yangtze went over. Then Kweilin, the\r\ncapital of Kwangsi province, went over on October 25th. This was the\r\nfirst of the southern provinces to join the movement openly. On October\r\n25th noble Fuchau, the famous seaport capital of old Fukien province,\r\nwent over, and we have already quoted a wonderful message to the white\r\nman from their “Sia Hwei” (reform association). On October 26th,\r\nNgan-king, capital of Nganhwei province, declared for the rebels, and\r\non the same day General Li was suggested as provisional president of\r\nthe forming republic of Han, with six of China’s twenty-one provinces\r\nalready seceding. Reform was as hot as a prairie fire, and almost as\r\nhard to manage.\r\n\r\nOn October 29th a remarkable thing occurred among the divisions being\r\nmassed for an attack on the rebels’ capital at Wuchang. The Twentieth\r\nDivision was at Lanchow camp, east of Peking, under General Chang Shao\r\nTeng. They formed the famous Army League, and made reform demands\r\non the packed National Assembly at Peking, just as Cæsar’s immortal\r\nThirteenth Legion, before the rebellion, sent demands to the Roman\r\nSenate, whose orders they were supposed to take. In consternation, the\r\npacked National Assembly granted the Nineteen Constitutional Articles,\r\nand the Manchu regent, Prince Chun, an able and traveled man (he went\r\nto Germany in 1901) daily issued edicts and yellow Peking Gazettes,\r\nfull of tearful promises, in which, however, the central and southern\r\nrebellious provinces had no confidence. They said: “Edicts are like the\r\nwings of day and night; it all depends on which side the sun is.” This\r\naction of the Twentieth Division halted the government’s war measures,\r\nand plans were laid to get loyal divisions near the Lanchow camp, and\r\nget rid of General Chang the First. This general was not strong enough\r\nto attack Peking on his own account, for there were imperial divisions\r\nbetween him and Generals Li and Hwang of the revolutionists. But he was\r\nstrong enough to be stubborn, and not move forward. Peking was largely\r\nin panic. The railroad station was piled high with household goods,\r\nand excursion trains for the flight of the Manchus were running to\r\nTientsin as fast as they could be switched. The streets of Peking were\r\ncrowded with mule carts, bearing bullion sycee and coins to be stored\r\nin the vaults of foreign banks in the legation quarter. No one half\r\nguessed before the wealth which the pensioned and privileged Manchus\r\nhad in cache. Proud princes of the blood were even willing to stand\r\nup all the way to Tientsin in open coal cars. Foreigners, legations,\r\nrailways and banks were popular as never before in the north, as a\r\nvery present refuge in time of trouble! Marvelous treasures of vases,\r\ntapestries, and jade were entrusted to foreigners for safe-keeping,\r\nand the treasures of the Mukden and Peking palaces were sacrificed,\r\nforeign agents taking advantage of the opportunity. Where could a\r\nManchu take them: to Jehol, to Kalgan where the Russ waited, to Mukden\r\nwhere the Japanese waited? That was only like running from the door\r\nto be caught on the roof. Before long, treasures next in wonder to\r\nthose looted at Peking in 1900 will find their way into the palaces,\r\nmansions and museums of the Occident, and artistic China will be robbed\r\nbare as a bone; for Peking has long been robbing China of art. The\r\nhotels and khans of Peking were crowded to the roofs, and the refugees\r\noverflowed into the cellars and stables and moats. Merchantmen were\r\nchartered, and held with steam up at Tientsin, ready to afford a refuge\r\nfor panic-stricken Manchu princes, or disgraced Chinese officials\r\nlike Sheng. Missionaries in the outskirts trusted the promises of the\r\n“Sia Hwei”, and stayed at their posts. Alarmed consuls arrested them\r\nin order to bring them into the capital, and the Chinese forgot the\r\ndignity due to their arms and laughed at the humorously incongruous\r\nsituation!\r\n\r\nOn November 3rd, the Imperial Third Division under General Wong Chou\r\nYuen, with the assistance of Admiral Sah’s fleet, attacked the rebels\r\nin native Hankau City. The vast flat city is not adapted for defense,\r\nand the loyalists were infinitely better equipped. General Li was short\r\nof ammunition. His troops, however, put up a brave fight, time and\r\nagain charging hopelessly with cold steel against machine guns, and\r\neliciting the unqualified admiration of the foreigners. On that day the\r\nImperial Third Division made a bloody name for itself in the respect\r\nof massacre of non-combatants and arson. A prosperous city of nearly a\r\nmillion was reduced to the appearance of nearly a wrecked village. Both\r\nrebels and loyalists saved the foreign quarter along the Yangtze Bund,\r\nwith its palatial consulates and business houses, and the American\r\nEpiscopal St. Paul’s cathedral and St. Peter’s church, which were\r\nturned into hospitals by Doctors Glenton and MacWillie, and nurse Miss\r\nClark of the Red Cross. Across the river at Wuchang, the buildings of\r\nthe American Episcopal Boone University were turned into a hospital by\r\nDoctors Merrins, Paterson and others of the brave. Heroic missionaries\r\nheld up their hands against the Third Division, and pleaded the rules\r\nof the Red Cross, but the Manchus, especially Prince Tsai Tao and\r\nothers of the Tsai princes, desired by a massacre to induce the rebels\r\nto massacre the first time they had a victory, and thus bring on\r\nforeign intervention to save the dynasty. A dynasty that can not stand\r\nwithout foreign intervention will never stand, for true strength is\r\nin the hearts of the people alone. It was the old Boxer trick of the\r\ndowager empress, Tse Hsi, in 1900.\r\n\r\nThe rebels, however, meant to keep their heads, even under such\r\nterrific provocation as that bloody Race Track field of Hankau, over\r\nwhich the machine guns of the Imperial Third Division swept, and those\r\nbloody streets, maloos and walls where non-combatants were butchered\r\nif they wore a piece of white, or had their queues severed, both of\r\nwhich were hated rebel signs. To and fro the tide of war surged. On\r\nNovember 3rd, a great change occurred, for on that day the rebels’\r\ngreat misfortune in having no fleet, was to a large degree nullified.\r\nShanghai arsenal, which supplied Admiral Sah’s fleet, and Shanghai’s\r\nnative walled city, went over to the revolutionists. This was the\r\nsecond great step forward. The rebels secured the well-known Wu Ting\r\nFang as foreign minister of the republic of Han, and their organization\r\nspread and strengthened in everything except money and a modern\r\nequipped force.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, the far southwestern capital and province, Yunnan,\r\nwith its splendid army and police, declared for the red, white and\r\nblue sun flag of the republic. Two days after, on November 5th, the\r\nfamous bore-city, Hangchow, the center of culture, and capital of the\r\ncoast province of Chekiang, was captured by assault, the Manchu general\r\nputting up a strong defense in the Tartar walled section of the city.\r\nNingpo, in the same province, and Suchow, another ancient capital of\r\nculture in Kiangsu province, went over on the same day.\r\n\r\nOn November 6th, Admiral Sah’s sailors handed part of the imperial\r\nfleet over to the rebels at Shanghai, and the rebels were now able to\r\nreform their center line. This also gave the republicans their first\r\nnucleus of a navy. Admiral Sah Chen Ping received his baptism of fire\r\nin the battle of the Yalu, under the brave Admiral Ting and Commander\r\nTeng. He commanded in suppressing riots at Changsha in 1910, when Yale\r\nCollege branch was barely saved, and he is well known as the host\r\nof Admiral Emery’s American fleet at Amoy, when the white squadron\r\nwas girdling the world under the surprised eyes of Japan, whose\r\nmixed-school and emigration “bluffs” were called by President Roosevelt\r\nin this significant but quiet way. It was most important to win Kiangsu\r\nprovince, and Chinkiang City was therefore talked over on November 6th.\r\nThe same day, in the far north, the coaling city and naval base of\r\nChifu in Shangtung province, declared for reform.\r\n\r\nUp to this time the cultured old Ming capital of Nanking, the most\r\nbeloved city in China, had held out under a concentrated force of\r\n12,000 imperialists, who were unusually well equipped. After Wuchang,\r\nHanyang and Shanghai, it was next in importance to capture Nanking\r\non the right wing of the rebels. The imperialists knew that to hold\r\nNanking was worth an army of 200,000 men, and General Chang Hsun (we\r\nwill call him Chang the Second) was in equipment and temper a man\r\nto their minds. His second in command was General Chao, and it was\r\nrumored that bloody General Chang Piao was within the walls. The civil\r\nviceroy of Nanking was the well known Chang Jen Chung, who instituted\r\nthe first Chinese industrial exhibition at Nanking in 1910. On the\r\nnortheast of the walled city are the peaks of Purple Mountain, 1,400\r\nfeet high, dominating with its huge Armstrong and Krupp guns the north\r\ngate, Ta Ping Men, and the east gate, Chao Yang Men, and the great\r\ncapital, around which the mighty Yangtze flows, yellow flooded to the\r\nbrim. This hill, and the Tartar section of the city, Chang the Second\r\nfortified, so that it would take a hundred to one to drive him out.\r\nOn November 8th, the dauntless rebels, led by General Ling, under the\r\nprotection of fire from the Canton artillery, took the armory, arsenal\r\nand powder mills outside the south wall, rushed the outworks, and held\r\npart of the southern city with insufficient force. One of the cannon\r\nballs went crashing through the “North Pole” pagoda in the Tartar City.\r\nOn November 9th, the imperialists at the strong south fort (Nan Men)\r\nhoisted a white flag of apparent surrender, and as the republicans\r\ncame up, “near enough to see the white of their eyes,” they opened a\r\ntreacherous fire upon them. The Manchu troops, under General Tieh\r\nLiang, looted their own fine military school in the city. There let us\r\nleave the rebel lines and pickets for a few days, while General Li and\r\nGeneral Hwang on the far left wing were being appealed to for men, and\r\nabove all, for siege and machine guns and ammunition.\r\n\r\nOn November 9th, Fuchau had to be stormed again, for the imperialists\r\nhad been reinforced. On that same day, Canton, always stanch for a\r\nmodern China, and mother of nearly all the reformers, went over to\r\nthe rebels under President of Assembly Wu Hon Man, General Chan Kwang\r\nMing, and Wong Ching Wai, and drove the imperial viceroy to Hongkong\r\nnear by, where the British government pleaded with the great Chinese\r\nbody to spare their unwelcome hostage, who had fled in Chinese custom\r\n“to a city of refuge”. All over China, as in the Palestine of the\r\nBible, are towers of refuge for this very purpose. The American cruiser\r\n_New Orleans_, Captain Miller, had steamed up to Nanking and taken\r\non board hundreds of foreigners, including seventy-five Americans,\r\nand records. On November 10th, bloody Chang the Second gave orders,\r\nin the old “Boxer” trick plan, for the awful massacre of Nanking.\r\nThe aim was first to incite the imperial soldiery with the sight of\r\nblood, as tigers baited. On the lovely bright afternoon, the prison was\r\nopened and 200 prisoners were sent into the yamen courtyard, “to their\r\nfreedom,” as they thought. There they were made to kneel in a row,\r\nwhile their necks were stretched out by the queue. An executioner, with\r\na mercury weighted Taifo shortsword, hurried along the long line, using\r\nonly one practised blow to sever each head. The heads were elevated on\r\nbamboo poles. The Manchu troops then tasted the blood in the belief\r\nthat human blood would make them brave and invulnerable. They even\r\ndipped their coarse biscuits in the gory pools. They were then ready\r\nfor anything that was merciless.\r\n\r\nIn force, Chang’s trained troops, with machine guns, swept down from\r\nPurple Mountain, Tiger fort, Lion fort and the Tartar section of the\r\ncity, on the small force of republicans, and the innocent population\r\nof Nanking the Refined. Shame on the Ninth Division of Shangtung\r\nterritorial troops and the old-style turbaned “braves”. Every man\r\nwho had no queue; every woman who had the rebel sign of white in her\r\napparel or hair; every man, woman or child who was a Nankingese was\r\nslaughtered without opposition, and the odious Ninth Division waded\r\nback to Tiger, Lion and Purple Hills through the bloody shambles.\r\nThis was not war; not even hell; this was an insane massacre of the\r\ninnocents. The few republican troops under the indomitable General Ling\r\nfought until their ammunition was spent, and then with cold steel set,\r\nthey awaited the rain of bullets from machine guns across the lead\r\nswept spaces of the immense, half-built-up city. It availed nothing.\r\nPeking breathed with hope. Chang the Second was a general after the\r\n“Boxer” Manchu heart. Manchu princes--yea, even those who had visited\r\nAmerica and England, like the dashing Prince Tsai Tao and Prince Tsai\r\nChun, and who should have known better--had been urging massacres, and\r\nChang the Second had apparently understood them. General Chang the\r\nSecond was heartily backed up by the merciless Tartar general, Tieh\r\nLiang.\r\n\r\nOn November 11th, Amoy, the famous port of Fukien province, where\r\nAmerican officers have been so often entertained by Admiral Sah and\r\nother Chinese admirals, was taken, the American cruiser _Saratoga_ (the\r\nold _New York_ of Santiago fame) and the American gunboat _Quiros_\r\nsteaming out of the harbor so as to be non-combatants in fact and\r\nin influence. The American monitor _Monterey_, so as to protect\r\nforeigners, later steamed into the harbor, where she was often struck\r\nby stray bullets. On November 13th, the most remarkable thing thus far\r\nin the revolution occurred, though the impulse was not permanently\r\nfixed. Mukden, the home capital of the Manchu race, the mausoleum of\r\ntheir founder, and of many of their dead emperors, under the influence\r\nof Chinese immigrants, declared its independence under General Wuh\r\nHsiang Chen, and the reform speaker of the Mukden Assembly, Wu Lun\r\nLien. During all this turmoil, Pechili, Shansi, and Honan provinces\r\nwere strongly held by Manchu and Mongol “banner” troops, but Foreign\r\nMinister Wu Ting Fang of the republicans got a note through to the\r\nAmerican minister at Peking, asking him to deliver it to the Manchu\r\nregent, Prince Chun. The note requested the Court to abdicate, and\r\nretire to Jehol, 200 miles northeast of Peking, where they were\r\npromised positive protection, and liberal pensions. In the meantime\r\nYuan Shih Kai returned from exile at Chang Te in Honan province to\r\nPeking, and took up the reins of power as provisional premier of\r\na limited Manchu monarchy; began treating with the republicans,\r\nsolidifying the Manchu army, and soliciting foreign loans, as the\r\nempress dowager’s strong-box no longer furnished funds. Only three out\r\nof twenty-one provinces, and three territories, were now remitting to\r\nPeking, but Peking had the mighty northern army.\r\n\r\nOn November 17th, the revolutionists under Generals Li and Hwang\r\nattacked the imperial lines at Hankau, and despite their poor equipment\r\nin machine guns and artillery, led by a regiment of Roundheads called\r\n“Dare to Die” (Pu Pa Tsze) men, commanded by Colonel Wen, who graduated\r\nfrom West Point in 1909, they took three of the four parallels by\r\ncold steel charges, sapper work and bomb throwing. One of the rebel\r\nshells from Wuchang punched a hole in a 2,000,000-gallon tank of oil in\r\nHankau, and the streets were flooded two feet deep with kerosene. It\r\nwas the first time that Chinese had met Chinese in scientific modern\r\nwar, and it marked the entrance of China into the modern arena, where\r\nMight strikes for Right, instead of only arguing for it. China had\r\nbegun to find herself. Meanwhile there was distress in Singan in the\r\nnorth, which city had declared for reform on October 24th. The Manchus\r\nhad retaken the suburbs of the city, for it was in their sphere of\r\ncontrol, and had begun, with their mobs, to massacre missionaries, as\r\nwas expected. The China Inland Mission outside the city was attacked,\r\nand the English Baptist, Scandinavian and American missions throughout\r\nthe province were struck at. Blame was put on the Mohammedans wherever\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nLet us go down to Nanking for a moment, to see how the war is\r\nprogressing. To keep Nanking and Shanghai in touch, the Americans had\r\nbrought up their beautiful cruisers _New Orleans_ and _Albany_, for the\r\nAmerican Vice-consul Gilbert and the intrepid American missionaries,\r\nDoctor Macklin, President Bowen, Mr. Blackstone, Mr. Garrett and\r\nothers were in the city. General Hsu of the imperialists, with the\r\nThirty-fifth Regiment of Infantry, on November 21st, hoisted the red,\r\nwhite and blue flag and left the strong lines of Purple Mountain and\r\nthe Tartar city to join the rebel ranks, which were being reinforced\r\nfrom Canton and other directions also. Bloody General Chang the Second,\r\nthe imperial commander, immediately had all General Hsu’s relatives in\r\nNanking murdered in revenge.\r\n\r\nIn far-away London, Doctor Sun Yat Sen, with an American adviser and\r\nfriend, “General” Homer Lea, set sail for Shanghai on the same day. He\r\nfirst went to Paris, and then took the liner _Martha_ at Marseilles\r\nfor Hongkong, from which place he planned safely to reach Shanghai to\r\ncomplete the rebel government. On November 22nd, when the imperialists\r\nwith all their foreign friendships were unable to consummate their\r\nloans, the rebels at Shanghai opened a Republic of Han Central Bank,\r\nwith a capital of 5,000,000 taels. The title of the bank was the “Chung\r\nHua”, and the first notes were dated in the 4609th year of Huang Ti\r\n(august sovereign), he being the mythical first emperor of China,\r\nand the inventor of the Chinese ideograph. The notes were printed in\r\nEnglish on one side and entitled “The Republican China Military Bank\r\nNote”. Other notes were issued by the provincial rebels and read as\r\nfollows in English and Chinese: “The Chinese Revolutionary Government\r\npromises to pay the bearer ---- dollars after one year of its\r\nestablishment in China on demand at the Treasury of the said government\r\nin Canton, or its agents abroad. 1st January, 1911. For President\r\n(sd.) Sun Wen.” It will be noted that the Christian calendar had now\r\ncome into effect. The shops immediately took the notes at a premium,\r\nsomething unique in China, the land of financial discounts and chaotic\r\nexchange. Enthusiasm grew. For the first time in the history of modern\r\nChina, a company of women took up arms and advanced with the lines.\r\nThere were also many Red Cross corps of women, from Canton, Fuchau,\r\nWuchang, Shanghai, etc.\r\n\r\nWe shall return to Nanking. On November 25th, by hard scraping at\r\nCanton, the rebels under General Ling brought up twelve field guns for\r\nsix hours and fired on the imperial position on Tiger Hill and Lion\r\nHill on the northwest, near the famous Ming tombs, which are outside\r\nthe walls of Nanking (not to be confounded with the remainder of the\r\nMing dynasty tombs which are at Nankou, northwest of Peking). Then\r\n1,500 troops, led as usual by companies of queueless “Dare to Die”\r\nboys, many of whom were students in Nanking Protestant University\r\n(American), charged, and drove twice their number of imperialists\r\nfrom the strong lines, which were supplied with heavy Armstrong and\r\nKrupp four-point-seven and six-inch guns. Unfortunately, many shots\r\nstruck the gate of the tombs, behind which the imperialists had also\r\nfortified themselves. The rebel navy now came nearer, despite the fire\r\nof Lion Hill, and prepared for the attack, as the rebel infantry drew\r\ntheir lines closer around the largest walled city of China. Guns were\r\nimmediately brought up to breach the heavy walls and high gates and\r\ntrain on the Lion Hill and Tiger forts, which were within the Tartar\r\ncity, and keeping the navy back.\r\n\r\nOn the left wing at Hankau the rebels were gaining successes. At an\r\narmistice, on November 24th, Yuan Shih Kai’s representatives told\r\nGeneral Li (whom they met at the British consulate on the bund) that he\r\nhad better trust the Manchus, as they could secure the hated Russian\r\nor Japanese intervention as in the old notorious days of 1896 and\r\n1900. Li replied that the republicans had no trust any more in Manchu\r\npromises of reform or real permanent constitutionalism; that the usual\r\nrelapse of the “Boxer sickness” would come! At Manila, Hongkong and\r\nSingapore, the Americans and British were preparing troops to be ready,\r\nas in 1900, to rush them to Tientsin to save the Peking legations\r\nand missionaries, if the Manchus, or Hunghutz, or Mongol brigands\r\nbrought on a massacre to secure foreign intervention. Though America\r\nand Britain emphatically stand for non-intervention and non-partition\r\nof China, both these nations feared Russia and other powers which\r\nwere hard to restrain. Britain’s action at this time in restraining\r\nambitious Japan (greedy with the taste of Formosa, Korea and South\r\nManchuria) can not be praised too highly. Wu Ting Fang, Doctor Sun\r\nand General Li of the republicans, from Shanghai, London and Wuchang\r\nrespectively, issued proclamations that foreigners and missionaries\r\nwere to be respected highly as the best friends of New China. In Shansi\r\nprovince the republicans, separated from their base, were having a hard\r\ntime against the Imperial Sixth Division under General Sheng Yun, which\r\nhad every advantage of succor by railway from Peking and the junction\r\nat Ching Ting. The imperialists bribed soldiers to assassinate General\r\nWu of the republican forces operating in these northwest provinces.\r\nThis was a terrible blow to reform.\r\n\r\nOn November 26th, the rebels, under General Ling Chang, attacked the\r\nstrong hill forts above Nanking with determination. There was much\r\nfiring of heavy guns from the river also, as the new navy of fifteen\r\nsmall vessels came up. Dogged charges were made across the open and\r\nup the zigzag of Purple Hill. The rebel losses were tremendous, and\r\nChang the Second, of the imperialists, proved himself as grim a defense\r\nfighter as he was a ruthless leader of massacre. The rebel attack\r\nunder General Ling Chang was brilliant and reckless. Who will sing\r\nthe feats of the new Chinese arms,--yes, the Chinese, who the world\r\nsaid would never make soldiers, even if they had a great cause at\r\nheart. The fighting was not as magnificently solid and desperate as\r\nPickett’s gray charge at Gettysburg, the Cuirassiers’ wild ride into\r\nthe valley of death at Waterloo, Linievitch’s grim defense of Putiloff\r\nHill, the shouting sweep of Oku’s dwarf Japanese up Nanshan Heights,\r\nor the silent plunge of Oyama’s ranks into the Liaoyang valley, or\r\nagainst the black Mukden lines. It was as determined, daring and\r\nbrilliant, however, as any land engagement in the South African or\r\nSpanish-American Wars, and far braver and stronger than the theatrical\r\nengagements, with air-ship accessories, of the Italy-Tripoli War. The\r\nworld’s critics must now change their criterions. A strong cause WILL\r\nmake a strong battle anywhere the world over, no matter what the color\r\nof the soldier, or the cut or tint of his battle flag. The fighting now\r\nclosed in on Nanking, the old capital of the Mings, the high-water city\r\nof the Taiping rebellion, and the rebels had a great deal to avenge,\r\nand a great deal to gain. To fail in the attack on Nanking meant a\r\ntremendous setback to the rebellion. Few reinforcements could come, for\r\nthe fighting was in half a dozen provinces, and along a broken front\r\nextending from Chingtu to Hankau and Nanking, 1,000 miles, with railway\r\ntransport service, foreign ammunition, money and sympathy, favoring\r\nthe imperialists; and sea and river transport, and the sympathy of the\r\nBritish and American peoples favoring the rebels, who, of course, had\r\nno navy worth counting as yet.\r\n\r\nThe alarmed Manchu regent, Prince Chun, at Peking, now gave out\r\nhis oath, in the name of the child emperor, Pu Yi (throne name,\r\nHsuan Tung), sworn before the open heaven to God (Tien), before the\r\nConfucian ancestral tablets, and before Buddha’s image, as follows: “My\r\npolicy and choice of officials have not been wise; hence the recent\r\ntroubles. Fearing the fall of the sacred Manchu dynasty, I accept\r\nthe advice of the National Assembly. I swear to uphold the Nineteen\r\nConstitutional Articles (demanded by the 20th Army Division at Lanchow)\r\nand organize a parliament, excluding the Manchu and Mongol nobles from\r\nadministrative posts. The heavenly spirits of your forefathers will see\r\nand understand.” They understood! The educated Chinese of the central\r\nand southern provinces laughed; they had heard the like before, and\r\nbesides, this oath was taken under compulsion of the Army League.\r\nThe new rebel government in Kwangtung province, under Wu Hon Man, its\r\npresident, was as yet unable to police the notorious pirate waters\r\nof the Si Kiang (West River), running far up country from Canton,\r\nand the large British tonnage, though armed, suffered. Chief Officer\r\nNicholson, of the steamer _Shui On_, was killed in a private attack at\r\nJunction Creek on November 30th, which infuriated British Hongkong,\r\nwhich was holding its gunboats in leash. The large Chinese tonnage in\r\nfear tied up to the wharves and bund of Canton and the riverine ports.\r\nA trick of the West River pirates was to anchor a deserted stoneboat\r\nacross the channel, and as the steamer slowed up, the snake boats and\r\nmotor launches of the pirates dashed alongside from the creeks and\r\ncane-brakes. The most daring of these brigand chiefs was the notorious\r\nLuk, from whom we shall hear later. Everywhere else, however, as we\r\nhave shown, for instance at Fuchau, the republicans were splendidly\r\nprotecting foreign traders and missionaries.\r\n\r\nI have said that the revolutionists’ line was too long to defend, with\r\ntwo principal sieges taking place three hundred miles apart. Peking\r\nunderstood this, and while the rebels reinforced their attack on the\r\nright flank at Nanking, the imperialists brought down reinforcements\r\nby railway to General Feng Kwo Chang, at Hankau, who at once attacked\r\nthe rebel left flank in force, aiming to cripple the rebels by taking\r\nback the essential Hanyang arsenal. Hei Shan, Meit Zu and Tortoise\r\nforts were taken by machine and field gun fire and charges, and General\r\nLi’s rebel ranks fell back under severe loss. The retreating ranks\r\ndidn’t carry their bird cages with them as the gentlemen soldiers of\r\nChifu did in the China-Japan War of 1894! General Feng’s and General\r\nWong’s imperialist troops, after breaking through the Tung Chi (East\r\nMessenger) gate and looting, now put the torch to the rest of Hankau,\r\ndestroying the homes of a million people, and burning a hundred million\r\ndollars’ worth of property. Such an uncalled for, accursed outrage,\r\nsuch an unjustifiable act of wholesale arson against non-combatants has\r\nnever been known. What would history have said had the Germans burned\r\nParis, the British, Pretoria or the Americans, Manila? What should\r\nbe said when the Manchu imperialists burned Hankau? Why didn’t they\r\nrather sell its tiles, its silk, its oils, its mountains of tea? They\r\nadmitted that they needed money. At least there would have been no\r\nworld’s loss of property. Hankau belonged to the world as much as to\r\nChina. The Manchu must yet answer for this arson, for arson and murder\r\nare unjustifiable world crimes. Arson makes it harder and costlier for\r\nan American, a Briton, a German, a Frenchman, to live, as the wave of\r\ncost rolls on, as much as it makes it harder for the Chinese to live.\r\nIn these days of world conservation, no nation should be allowed to\r\nput the firebrand to property because men are fighting or arguing over\r\nan idea. Shame on the sack and burning of Hankau by the Manchus. The\r\nBritish, Americans, volunteers and jackies, and other foreigners on\r\nthe long bund, heaped up breastworks of even rice bags, and swept the\r\nriverside and race track on either flank in defense of the palatial\r\nforeign concessions. Here a blue-jacket, there a marine, and between an\r\nununiformed volunteer clerk, the boys shouldered their Springfields,\r\nLee-Enfields and Mausers, and held brave guard at the thinnest part\r\nof the long-stretched line of the white man’s empire of influence and\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nOn the same day the rebels were doing better on the right flank at\r\nNanking, despite their long front of fifteen miles wide. The Ta Ping\r\nMen (North) gate of the city, and Tiger Hill fort within the walls\r\nwere bombarded, and General Ling brought up the rebel guns to bombard\r\nGeneral Chang the Second, who had contracted his lines to Purple, Lion,\r\nTiger and Pei Che Kao forts in the northeast of the city, as far away\r\nas possible from the rebel fleet, part of which had to be recalled to\r\nWuchang to assist General Li in his extremity. The imperialists held\r\nthe strong Nan Men gate in the south of the city, and the Chao Yang\r\nfort at the east gate, which was fortified with two six-inch, two\r\nfour-point-seven, and two three-inch guns, as well as Maxims, surely a\r\ndeadly armament. In wise patience America and Britain still held their\r\ntroops at Manila and Hongkong, respectively, but Japan was allowed, on\r\nthe 26th of November, to rush 1,000 more legation and railway guards\r\nto Tientsin, and the railway guards along the Japanese railways in\r\nManchuria were reinforced far beyond international conventions. Captain\r\nSowerby, with the newly organized Foreign Frontier Guards, started\r\nfrom Peking to help the harassed missionaries who were being murdered\r\nin Singan and Taiyuen in the north. This astonishing expedition\r\nwas remarkable for its intrepidity and its success. Within a month\r\nand a half Captain Sowerby’s men had gone from Taiyuen to Singan,\r\ngathered together forty missionaries, and following the course of\r\nthe Wei and Yellow Rivers through the famous Tongkwan pass, brought\r\nhis charges safely to Honan City on the Honan railway, from which\r\nplace they could easily reach Tientsin. Lies began to spread like\r\nwildfire. Pirates committed atrocities along the West River section\r\nof Kwangtung province, and the Manchus and their sympathizers blamed\r\nit on the ineffective rebel organization of Canton. In the north,\r\nHunghutz, Mongol and Boxer brigands murdered missionaries, rebels\r\nand non-combatants, and the republican sympathizers blamed it on the\r\nineffective Manchu government. This is certain: the rebels desperately\r\ndisliked foreign intervention, and only pleaded for time to win and\r\norganize, while the Manchus saw that, if driven to the last wall,\r\nmassacre and lawlessness would help the retention of the dynasty by\r\ncausing foreign interventions; and the Manchus were willing to lose all\r\nManchuria to Japan and all Mongolia and Turkestan to Russia, to bring\r\nthis about. The reader will note that none of the many old generals\r\nhas appeared on the imperial side, as the battles narrowed down to\r\nengagements with modern weapons of precision and power, requiring\r\ngenerals trained in modern war. Generals Li and Hwang, of the rebels,\r\nopposed Generals Feng and Wong at Hankau, and Generals Ling and Hsu\r\nopposed Generals Chang and Tieh of the imperialists at Nanking. More\r\nforeign officers, especially Japanese and Germans incognito, served\r\nin the loyalist ranks than in the rebel ranks, and German ammunition\r\nand guns were freely served to the imperialists. After the battle of\r\nHanyang, two Germans were found among the imperialists’ dead, and two\r\nof the imperialists’ wounded were Germans, one of them a colonel in\r\nthe German army. The Japanese trusts, the princes of the Choshiu and\r\nSatsuma clans, who control the House of Peers and the Genro Council,\r\nand thus run the government by veto, did not want a republic in China.\r\nThey feared it would bring about the control of the budget by the House\r\nof Representatives and real popular government in Japan, which country\r\nis now absolutely controlled by the aristocracy; for the Japanese Diet\r\nis no more representative of the overtaxed people than is the Russian\r\nDuma. They feared also that if the Chinese pope-emperor could fall,\r\nso could the Japanese pope-emperor who was no more holy. The German\r\nsyndicates were also anxious to maintain their confiscatory privileges\r\nin Shangtung province, which were obtained from the Manchus. Dictator\r\nYuan always preferred German instructors in his Pechili, Honan and\r\nShangtung armies.\r\n\r\nOn November 27th, Yuan Shih Kai, the premier-dictator at Peking, had\r\npoured out the treasures of the Manchu empress dowager’s private chest,\r\nand well paid and well armed troops were rushed to Hankau. Generals\r\nFeng and Wong Chou Yuen had 30,000 modern drilled and equipped men, and\r\nthe divisions were heavily supplied with precise artillery. Hankau City\r\nand Hanyang arsenal across the river were bombarded mercilessly, and\r\nthe imperialists of Wong’s bloody third division, under cover of this\r\nartillery practise, crossed the Han River thirty miles up and flanked\r\nthe left wing of the rebels, whose old Armstrong artillery, using\r\npercussion shells, was no match for the modern three and four-inch\r\nguns of the imperialists, who had the arsenals of the north and the\r\nGermans at Kiaochou to draw on. Neither was the rebel infantry equal,\r\nas half of their regiments had been drawn back to Nanking, 400 miles\r\naway, by river. The best the rebels could do was to oppose 15,000 men,\r\nwith weak artillery, to 30,000 excellently equipped imperialists. The\r\nresult was that the all-important Hanyang arsenal and world-wide known\r\niron works were lost, and Generals Li and Hwang Hing had to retreat\r\nto Wuchang, the rebel capital across the Yangtze River, which is a\r\ndifficult place to defend, as its flanks and rear are vulnerable. The\r\nresult of this great reverse was that the lukewarm viceroys in the\r\nnorthern provinces, who had gone over to the rebels’ cause in the first\r\nflush of success, began to declare again for the Manchus. Shangtung\r\nprovince went back, and Yuan Shih Kai by the telegraph on this day got\r\nhis own province of Honan to return to the imperial fold. Both of these\r\nare northern provinces. Premier Yuan now began rushing reinforcements\r\ndown the Grand Canal and railway to Yangchow and Pukow, nearly opposite\r\nNanking, so as to succor redoubtable General Chang the Second at\r\nNanking, and enable him to again occupy Tiger fort. General Feng came\r\nover from Hankau to advise Chang. The plan was, by taking back the\r\nHankau cities and Nanking, to turn both the left and right flanks of\r\nthe revolutionists, rush their capital of Wuchang, and crumple up the\r\nrebellion in Shanghai. Everything in equipment, transportation, foreign\r\nmen, money and artillery favored the imperialists. Everything in daring\r\nand enthusiasm favored the rebels, whose American-trained students\r\nrecited the dictum of Herodotus on republicanism: “The Athenians, when\r\ngoverned by tyrants, were superior in war to none of their neighbors,\r\nbut when freed from tyrants, became by far the first. This then shows\r\nthat as long as they were oppressed they purposely acted as cowards, as\r\nlaboring for a master, but when they were free every man was zealous to\r\nlabor for the State.”\r\n\r\nThere was one thing the rebels were weak or uncertain in. If they\r\ndestroyed China’s religion of aristocracy and king worship, what\r\nwould they give in its place? Would they give Christianity (their\r\nleaders, Doctor Sun and General Li, being Christians), and a permanent\r\nsatisfaction with the rule of a native president and congress over\r\ntwenty-one provincial presidents and assemblies? It was a mighty\r\ntask,--the greatest the world has known,--and few of the old viceroys\r\nand Manchuized Chinese literati of the Hanlin were at heart prepared\r\nfor its radical solution. True, the rebels could staff the twenty-one\r\nprovinces with advanced Kwangtung, Szechuen, Hupeh, Hunan and Kiangsu\r\nprovince men, but that was not republican home rule.\r\n\r\nThe aim and difficulty of the rebels was to maintain the new ideas\r\nagainst reverses in the provinces, which had developed few modern\r\nthinkers among the officials, who, like the troops, were looking for\r\nsalary first and country afterward. Yuan, the premier-dictator, who had\r\nweighed it all up in Honan, said to himself, according to some southern\r\ncritics: “Give me money enough for 100,000 splendid, modern-drilled\r\nnorthern men, and give me trunk railways. I’ll find men who will fight\r\nfor whichever side pays their wages; we must have order, which is\r\ncivilization’s first law.” Yuan was a believer in that truism that the\r\nradical reformers do all the work, and bear all the risk of reform, and\r\nthat the “standpatters”, the moderate progressives and reactionaries,\r\nenjoy all the fruit and political offices. Differently from Sun, Yuan\r\nwanted office first and influence afterward. He was now active in\r\nsoliciting foreign loans, securing $1,000,000 from Russia and Belgium,\r\nand the promise of $30,000,000 from Russia, Belgium and Japan, these\r\nbeing the pro-Manchu powers, while America and Britain represented\r\npro-Chinese sympathies. The rebels were just as active in soliciting\r\nprivate subscriptions in America and the Straits Settlements, and 70\r\nper cent. of the Chinese abroad sent a quarter of their fortunes to Sun\r\nYat Sen and Wu Ting Fang at Shanghai for the republican cause.\r\n\r\nHowever, it must be admitted that when the Manchus recruited Yuan Shih\r\nKai, the Honanese, they secured a tower of strength, another Li Hung\r\nChang, to a large degree a dictator, a believer in money, troops, quick\r\ntrial by drumhead, and decapitation, a good servant of any master who\r\nwould steadily employ him; a believer in dynasties more than peoples, a\r\nmodern progressive but not an idealist or natural republican, a man who\r\nhated the words “turbulent liberty”, but who loved the word “order”; a\r\nstatesman more like Diaz, Bismarck or Richelieu than like Washington or\r\nLincoln. He had never traveled abroad like thousands of other Chinese\r\nofficials. He could not speak or read English, and so knew little of\r\nthe great documents of liberty and idealism in their first fire of the\r\noriginal. He knew that he was smashing rapid progress for the second\r\ntime, just as he had gone against the reform Manchu emperor, Kwang Hsu,\r\nand the palace reformers from Canton: Kang Yu Wei, Liang Chi Choa,\r\netc., in 1898, and joined the reactionary “Boxer” dowager empress, Tse\r\nHsi. He feared the rebel sympathizers might assassinate him, and he\r\nrode as dictator about Peking with a cavalry escort. His headquarters\r\nwere in the modern Wai Wu Pu Building, which is fitted with steam\r\nheat, elevators, electric light, etc. There he gave regular interviews\r\nto the foreign press representatives, in emulation of the methods\r\nlong practised by Sunyacius and Wu Ting Fang at Shanghai. He made the\r\nManchus weak, too, for he matched their troops at Peking with his old\r\nShangtung and Honan territorial troops, man for man. He also sent the\r\nturbulent, stubborn twentieth division, shorn of its commander, Chang,\r\nfar to the eastward. The majority of the National Assembly had fled,\r\nand the Manchu princes would not come out of their bedrooms. If the\r\nrebels were to win now, they must produce even a stronger man than\r\nYuan. Who was that man; where was he in the making?\r\n\r\nIt is quite orthodox not to despair ever of immemorial China, and\r\nto expect a great man to arise when politics is at its worst, for\r\nConfucius arose from the rivalry of sixteen states, and he formulated\r\nhis political philosophy when he was a persecuted exile from his own\r\nstate of Lu. When the republicans were most dejected, that great\r\nrepublican, the American Methodist bishop, J. W. Bashford, of Shanghai,\r\nin season and out of season, unofficially beseeched them to quit\r\nthemselves like men. So large-hearted a man could not stand by and\r\nsee men who were fighting for liberty droop at their guns. He cheered\r\nthem; he talked to their students; he gave megaphone interviews to the\r\nworld press and supported the discouraged propaganda, fearing naught\r\nthe criticism which arose. He was a missionary, but more than that, he\r\nwas a man, and an American. Some British missionaries, too, came in for\r\ncriticism because they could not refrain from whispering in the ear of\r\nliberty the Cromwellian encouragement: “Be of good cheer.”\r\n\r\nBy November 29th the lack of money was thinning the lines of the\r\nrebel forces, and Dictator Yuan, at Peking, was growing in strength\r\nwith small foreign loans and arms from Russia, Japan and Germany.\r\nThe rebels, at Wu Ting Fang’s suggestion, in desperation, threatened\r\nto boycott the commerce of any nation making loans to the Manchu\r\ngovernment, and a German compradore was shot down at Hankau as he was\r\nin the act of delivering arms over to the imperialists. The Manchu\r\nTsai princes sold their art treasures for arms. The rebels melted the\r\nidols of the nation to make coin. In accord with the protocol of 1901,\r\nAmerica now formally offered the Peking government 2,500 troops to\r\nassist in keeping the railway from Peking to Tientsin open to the sea.\r\nThe Japanese had already landed their quota of this foreign force.\r\nNaturally the rebels looked on this landing of foreign troops in the\r\nManchu section of the country as, to a degree, foreign aid to the\r\nManchus, as it increased their prestige and sources of advice in the\r\nnorth. More subtle forces than those of arms began to work now on some\r\nof the rebel leaders, and the cause lapsed into darker days because of\r\nthe lack of money. Dictator Yuan, in Peking, was exultant, and said to\r\none member of the legations: “I give the rebellion eight more days to\r\nlive; I expect to have 100,000 modern troops and a railway.” Professor\r\nE. H. Parker, the eminent sinologue, now of Manchester University,\r\nEngland, when a British consul in Korea, wrote of “Yuan’s Machiavellian\r\ncharacter” in his book, _John Chinaman_. Even some of the Manchus\r\nagreed in the cry of the rebels: “Yuan is making himself dictator; he\r\nmay seek the throne; he may split off Northern China; Peking is too\r\nnear Russian Siberia.” He had sent the Manchu troops away from Peking,\r\nand gathered his old divisions (like Cæsar with his Thirteenth Legion)\r\nof Shangtung and Honan troops around him.\r\n\r\nYuan appealed to the provinces to send delegates to Peking to discuss\r\na constitution, but the rebel provinces replied: “No National\r\nAssembly can discuss constitutional government with freedom while\r\nyour troops, pounding their rifle stocks, stand at the door; remember\r\nthe Parliaments of King Charles.” The rebels cried: “If Yuan and the\r\nManchus win now, it is foreign money that does it. Why can’t we get\r\nforeign money; we’re the overwhelming majority of the people.” Some of\r\nthe foreign governments replied: “We are only interested in trade and\r\norder; we can’t wait for you to fight this out, and possibly kill some\r\nof our missionaries; you must win quickly or we’ll stand by the powers\r\nthat be.” The rebels replied: “Cromwell and Washington, Thiers and\r\nGrant didn’t win quickly, and if you let us lose now, we’ll fight it\r\nout again. You can’t withstand the constitutional rights of 400 million\r\npeople for the sake of a dynasty of raiders, who seized and entrenched\r\ntheir throne with five million subsidized cavalrymen, who have now\r\ngrown effete by subsidy. We are opposed to entrenched privilege just as\r\nmuch as you are. In Roosevelt’s words: ‘The land has got to be as good\r\nfor all of us as it is for some of us.’ These minority Manchus must\r\ncease to usurp office, pensions, privileges and concession granting.\r\nWe of the south are taxed without representation. If America could go\r\nto war with this as a cause, why can’t we?”\r\n\r\nYuan, under certain foreign advice, planned to throw a bridge across\r\nthe Yangtze River at Hankau, and get his railway down into the heart\r\nof the southern rebel provinces. He believed in quick facilities for\r\nthrowing his modern troops against uprisings, for his railway from\r\nPeking to Hankau had won him the present turn in the tide of affairs\r\nby enabling him to flank the long rebel lines. Oh! at this time, some\r\ncried, for an emperor warrior of the real Chinese, a descendant of the\r\nMings; a descendant of the house of Confucius (the Duke Kungs); or a\r\nWashington-like president of a Chinese republic, who could get foreign\r\nloans. This was the cry that was arising against the return of the\r\nManchu ghost, and the ominous shadow of a dictator. However, something\r\nhad been won. The agitation and the battles had taught the sweet themes\r\nof deathless liberty and a new Chinese nationalism to thousands who\r\nhad been supine, provincial, or anarchistic in their despair. It was\r\nrecalled that Tau Sze Tung, the reformer and son of a Hupeh governor,\r\nwho was beheaded in 1898, said on his way to the place of execution:\r\n“Martyrdom must always precede revolution; shall I not be the first\r\nmartyr?” Liberty is never defeated, for each time she falls she makes\r\nher conqueror concede something, for she only falls to her knees and\r\nrises again. The reactionary empress dowager, Tse Hsi, after her\r\nvictory in 1898, conceded reforms from 1900 to 1908, and it would be so\r\nwith her successors, perhaps, after this lesson of protest. A plan was\r\nlaid by some foreign bankers, and some Chinese, that if the republican\r\ngovernment was not a success, a direct descendant of Confucius, one\r\nKung, an American Presbyterian Christian of Shangtung province, would\r\nbe backed for the throne in the hope that the Chinese race would flock\r\nto his banner.\r\n\r\nOn November 28th, 29th and 30th, the rebels, under Generals Hsu and\r\nLing, made a master effort on their right wing, for which purpose they\r\nhad weakened their left wing, allowing the two Hankau cities to go. The\r\nCanton bomb throwing levies and artillerymen went into battle singing\r\nthis new hymn to Liberty, which is certainly rugged poetry of merit:\r\n\r\n “Freedom will work on this earth,\r\n  Great as a giant rising to the skies,\r\n  Come, Liberty, because of the black hell of our slavery,\r\n  Come enlighten us with a ray of thy sun.\r\n\r\n “Behold the woes of our fatherland.\r\n  Other men are becoming all kings.\r\n  Can we forget what our people are suffering?\r\n  China the Great is as an immense desert.\r\n\r\n “We are working to open a new age in China;\r\n  All real men are calling for a new heaven and a new earth.\r\n  May the soul of the people rise as high as Kwangtung’s highest peak\r\n          (Nan Mountain);\r\n  Spirit of Freedom, lead, protect us.”\r\n\r\nNanking was attached in force. The American navy withdrew, while the\r\nsmall rebel navy of fifteen vessels, under the protection of captured\r\nforts holding back free play of the Lion fort guns, moved up within\r\nrange to support the wide rebel attack of fifteen miles frontage. It\r\nwill be remembered that General Chang the Second, of the imperialists,\r\nheld some of the peaks of Purple Hill outside the northeast walls, and\r\nYuwatei fort on the south, and nearly all the city. The rebels took\r\nthe Tiger Hill fort and four of the northwest gates and forts, after\r\nbombardment by the Cantonese, sapping, and a spirited rush. Then Purple\r\nHill and Yuwatei forts were bombarded and rushed after a terrific\r\nengagement, the imperialists, under Generals Chang and Tieh, making a\r\nlast stubborn stand behind the ninety-foot high and thirty-foot thick\r\nwalls of the vast city. The scene was terrible to view. Clouds of\r\ncannon smoke, lighted by terrific flashes of gun fire, made the night\r\nof November 30th memorable. The revolutionists, practising Wolfe’s\r\nstrategy before Quebec was taken, by a secret path, rushed up a peak of\r\nPurple Mountain, above the imperial position, and shelled the imperial\r\npark of guns. Then in the night a charge, led by Colonel Wen, was\r\nmade by the “Dare to Die” picked brigade, who carried hand bombs and\r\nswords. A wild retreat followed down the mountain. Even boys fought\r\nwith the greatest bravery. The dying down of the terrific cannonade\r\nin the south meant that the republicans had rushed the Nan Men fort,\r\nand an explosion showed that they had successfully blown it up. Just\r\nas daylight broke, the strong Chao Yang, Tiger and Lion forts were\r\nagain rushed and taken. The rebels were bitter, and there was great\r\nslaughter of the imperialists in revenge for General Chang’s merciless\r\nmassacre of innocents when he declared a state of war at the beginning\r\nof the month. Great lawlessness overspread the land, the rebels as\r\nwell as the imperialists being unable to establish a police force,\r\nwhile they fought out the reform questions. Even in British Hongkong,\r\nwhere 500,000 Chinese are ruled by 5,000 British, the authorities\r\nhad to institute the public whipping of offenders, so as to keep\r\ndisorder on the part of the lawless intimidated. Complaint increased\r\nalong the Yangtze valley that the Germans were supplying arms to the\r\nimperialists at Hankau, as well as in the northern provinces, from\r\ntheir colony base of Kiaochou. Bitter complaint was also made that\r\nBaron Cottu was the go-between in asking Russia, France and Belgium for\r\na $30,000,000 loan for the Manchus and Yuan Shih Kai, which would give\r\nthe Russo-Asiatique Bank the same intrusive excuses that Russia availed\r\nof in 1898. The rebels were weak in Shensi province, and American\r\nmissionaries were killed by the mob in Singan. Dictator Yuan threw the\r\nSixth Division from Honan into Shensi to take the province back.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, December 2nd, at ten o’clock, a memorable scene occurred\r\nat Nanking. General Chang the Second escaped across the Yangtze River\r\nthrough the Ta Ping gate on the morning of December 1st to Pukow, the\r\nnorthern railway terminus, after planting a mine under the Tartar\r\nGeneral’s yamen, which was to be blown when the rebel General Hsu was\r\ncaught in the trap at the capitulation. He also secreted eighteen\r\nother mines in the Tartar city, which had therefore to be burned so\r\nas to make the explosion safe. General Chao succeeded in command of\r\nthe imperialists. The investiture was complete, and the situation was\r\nnow hopeless for the defenders. Twelve brave Americans had remained\r\non the scene, the great missionaries, Doctor Macklin, Mr. Garrett,\r\nDoctor Blackstone, President A. J. Bowen, of Nanking University, and\r\nothers, and the vice-consul, Mr. Gilbert, who dramatically, with\r\nfield glasses, watched the bombardment from a high graveyard within\r\nthe city. They believed in saving blood (“Chiu Ming,” as the Chinese\r\nsay), much provocation for revenge as there was on the side of General\r\nHsu’s victorious men. They pleaded with Hsu for the first humanitarian\r\nsurrender in Chinese civil war, as a thrilling example for all time\r\nthat Chinese revolutionists, like George Washington’s and Oliver\r\nCromwell’s men, were patriots and gentlemen at heart, and not mere\r\nfeudists fighting under the name of a great cause.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hsu, with the advice of Generals Ling, Li and Hwang, and\r\nForeign Minister Wu Ting Fang, rose to the high level. He agreed to\r\na surrender with honors, even guaranteeing the life of the notorious\r\nmurderer of non-combatants, General Chang the Second. The negotiations\r\ntook place under the guns of historic Purple Hill, while the panting\r\ntroops held enthusiasm in control. Behind the walls the imperialists\r\nbreathed hard, and the great populace of shopkeepers eagerly waited\r\nand watched the republican sun flags on Purple Mountain. Hurrah! a\r\nshout went up that lives would be guaranteed (“Chiu Ming”); yes, honor,\r\ntoo! Fling open the pounded, riddled iron “Great Peace” gate! The\r\nsteel muzzles of the hot Armstrongs, the deadly four-point-sevens, the\r\nspitting Rexer rapid fire and three-inch Krupp guns on Purple, Lion and\r\nTiger Hills, held their smoky breath like good hounds in leash, but\r\nstraining. The generals and captains marked time; the troops craned\r\ntheir heads; the Cantonese artillery hitched up the limbers to the gun\r\ncarriages. The American missionaries thanked God and led on the way\r\nof peace for a China that would never forget the moving scene, where\r\nforgiveness towered over revenge. Here they come, General Chao riding\r\nahead of the doughty Shangtung territorials with their yellow dragon\r\nflags flying for the last time, and the bloody turbaned men of escaped\r\nChang’s army. Ground arms and mark time! The victorious rebels kept\r\ntheir places, and under the fluttering red, white and blue sun flags of\r\nthe new republic, looked on at the impressive acts. The great column of\r\nimperialists deployed with music playing, saluted and piled their arms\r\nbefore the feet of the victors, General Hsu sitting on horseback where\r\nthe pacificators stood. Sun flags and white flags fluttered everywhere\r\nas the sign of rebel dominance. Who are these who now come up with\r\nreversed arms? They do not wear the German peaked caps, and the khaki\r\nuniform of modern troops, but the old turban and slovenly blue uniform\r\nof the ancient troops of China. They are Chang’s bloody old-style\r\nwarriors, 1,000 of them, wearing white bands in deep contrition and as\r\na seal of their lives from massacre. They, too, salute Hsu, the giver\r\nof their lives, some of them giving the unmilitary kotow instead of\r\nthe modern salute. A cheer went up, the bands playing with greater\r\nspirit. Hold open the “Great Peace” gate! Victorious Generals Hsu and\r\nLing, and their men, they of a hundred cold steel and bomb charges,\r\nblowing hot the trumpets of victory, and led by the shaven heroes, the\r\n“Dare to Die” regiment of immortal night charges, are on the ringing,\r\nclanging march for the ancient Ming city, which they have conquered,\r\nNanking the cultured; Nanking the proud capital of capitals; Nanking\r\nwhere was the yamen of the illustrious Viceroy Liu Kun Yih; Nanking of\r\nthe Taipings, and Nanking of the world’s widest republic! A friendly\r\nhand had touched off the mine under the Tartar general’s yamen, and\r\nthe eighteen other dastardly mines, so that the victors should not be\r\nblown up treacherously in the crowning hour of their rejoicing. White\r\nflags flutter everywhere. Once the sign of death in China, they are\r\nnow the sign of peace in China, as well as in the rest of the world.\r\nA shout of welcome goes up from the populace, who from the beginning,\r\nlike all the rest of the central and southern provinces, have been in\r\nsympathy with the revolution. Generals Hsu, Ling and Hwang at Nanking\r\nthen have indeed balanced for the rebels the imperialist victory at\r\nHanyang won by General Feng. The rebels lost their left wing, which\r\nwas turned. The imperialists have also now lost their left wing, which\r\nhas been thus crumpled up at Nanking. New moves must now be made on the\r\nchecker-board by Dictator Yuan at Peking.\r\n\r\nGovernor Chan Kwang Ming and President Wu Hon Man, of the Canton\r\nAssembly, sent out their torpedo-destroyers _Wu Ying_ and _Wupang_,\r\nand with the British gunboats _Robin_, _Sandpiper_ and _Moorhen_ from\r\nHongkong, and the American gunboat _Callao_, attacked the West River\r\npirates, and patrolled that romantic river as far as the shadow of\r\nWuchow Pagoda, 220 miles of varied temples, islands, gorges, reaches\r\nand river peaks. Mercantile vessels steamed up two by two, their\r\nwheel-houses sheathed with steel, their gun racks full, the barred\r\nhatches, which let air in but no smuggled pirates out, nailed down on\r\nthe ’tween decks, a guard at each hatch and over each port, and double\r\nquartermasters manning the wheel. Commerce had gone back to medieval\r\nconditions, and it was exciting. Rich compradores of Hongkong, like\r\nChan Kang Yu, of Douglas, Lapraik and Company, contributed 2,000\r\nuniforms and outfits to equip a regiment of President Wu’s provincial\r\ntroops. Part of the rebel navy now made a four-hundred-mile dash at\r\nforced draught to Wuchang and Hanyang, from Shanghai, to try to keep\r\nthe successful right wing of the imperialists from crossing to the\r\nrebels’ temporary capital. If the gunboats could keep the loyalists\r\nengaged at Hanyang, it was not impossible that the rebels, if greatly\r\nreinforced from Canton, could turn the flank and strike the loyalists’\r\nsupply railway in the rear.\r\n\r\nOn December 5, 1911, new moves were made at Peking. Prince Chun, the\r\nregent father of the baby Emperor Pu Yi (his real and not his throne\r\nname), resigned in favor of two co-regents, one a Manchu, Prince Tsai\r\nSu, and the other a Chinese, Hsu Shao Ching. This was a buffer move to\r\nsave the throne from the republican demands. For the first time in the\r\nthree hundred years’ history of the Manchu dynasty, a Chinese was thus\r\nbrought to share the regent’s power. Prince Tsai Su had been a grand\r\ncouncilor in the old days; and when a national assembly was granted he\r\nwas put in as its president by Manchu power. Later he was president\r\nof the Navy Board, and president of the Wai Wu Pu (Foreign Board). He\r\nis a moderate progressive, a Manchu of the Manchus and related to the\r\nemperor. Hsu Shao Ching, a Pechili Chinese, is well known as a former\r\nminister to Russia and Germany, and the first president of the Chinese\r\nEastern Railway. He was a grand councilor in the old days, a viceroy of\r\nManchuria, and president of the Railway Board (Yu Chuan Pu) in charge\r\nof loans. He has visited America. The appointment of this republican\r\ngeneral-in-chief was, of course, mere flattery, and he did not serve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright, 1913, The Bobbs-Merrill Company.\r\n\r\n  Mortuary statues near tombs of the last native Chinese dynasty, the\r\n    Ming, near Nanking.

A republican loan\r\nof ten million taels, bearing twelve per cent. interest, and sold at\r\nabout eighty per cent. of face value, was sought at Shanghai, Wu Ting\r\nFang seeking American subscriptions especially, for he kept reminding\r\nAmericans: “You are the mother of republics; the greatest republic, as\r\nwe will be the largest republic.” Wu also wired prominent American and\r\nBritish financiers and their governments, pleading that loans should\r\nnot be made to the Manchu government, and respectfully warning that:\r\n“The republican rebels would remember if loans were made to fight\r\ntheir cause.” This really had a deterrent influence, for Americans and\r\nBritons were able to influence France to suspend financial action for\r\na while. The American-educated Tang Shao Yi, Dictator Yuan’s chief\r\nassistant, now went to the rebel headquarters at Wuchang and Shanghai\r\nto interview General Li, Minister Wu and General Hsu regarding peace,\r\nand the rebels held sessions of delegates from the Yangtze, southern\r\nand western provinces. Kwangtung province began its republican\r\norganization, and sent up another quota of 3,000 modern troops from\r\nCanton, added to 10,000 previously sent, to reinforce General Li, who\r\nstood marking time at Wuchang against General Feng of the imperialists\r\nat Hanyang.\r\n\r\nBy this time the fine Tyne-built, gray Chinese cruiser _Hai Chi_, which\r\nsailed from New York in October, arrived at Shanghai, and amid wild\r\nrejoicing, such as only the southern Chinese can express, ran down the\r\ntriangular yellow dragon and hoisted the square tri-color sun flag of\r\nthe republican revolution. She was at once ordered to report at the\r\narsenal with her heavy load of ammunition, which was a godsend to the\r\nrevolutionists. This cruiser was the best known abroad of Chinese war\r\nvessels, and at once became the flagship of the rebel navy. She is\r\narmed with two eight-inch, and ten four-point-seven guns. On December\r\n14th, Doctor Sun Yat Sen (Sunyacius), with the American, Homer Lea,\r\narrived safely at Penang, Straits Settlements, a hotbed of Chinese\r\nreform, which has from time to time sheltered all the reformers like\r\nSun, Kang, etc., since the coup d’état in 1898. The rich foreignized\r\nCantonese owners of tin mines have been loyal to reform from the\r\nbeginning. When Sun arrived at Singapore on December 16th, a band of\r\nChinese girls met him, each waving the tri-color of the revolution and\r\nof the emancipation of Chinese womanhood, and singing the Chinese\r\nMarseillaise, _Chung Kwan_. The Chinese wore no queues, and the\r\ncaricatures which they distributed showed the pig, the dog, the monkey\r\nand the Manchu as all belonging to the races which wear queues! Who\r\nwill say that the Chinese are not distinguished for humor! I have for\r\nyears been trying to point out this quality in them.\r\n\r\nThe first wave of the revolution, which had died down somewhat by\r\nthe Hankau defeat, had rolled on even into far mountainous Tibet,\r\nand Gyangze, a walled and fortified town on the trade route between\r\nLhasa and Darjeeling, fell before the revolutionists on December 14th.\r\nGyangze will be remembered for the stand it made against Sir Francis\r\nYounghusband’s brilliant campaign in 1904 to open up the way from India\r\nto Lhasa, and also for the operations in its neighborhood by General\r\nChao Ehr Feng, who drove the sacred plotting Dalai Lama for the first\r\ntime out of China into India in the startling campaign of 1910.\r\n\r\nDuring this week the Yangtze River for six hundred miles presented\r\na remarkable scene, as Tang Shao Yi, the emissary of Dictator Yuan,\r\nsailed down to Shanghai to discuss peace terms with the revolutionists\r\nat the Town Hall at Shanghai, which was guarded by British, Sikh and\r\nother troops of the international settlement. At Hankau the last yellow\r\ndragon flag of the imperialists was seen, as the imperial legates, Tang\r\nShao Yi, Yen Shih Si and Yang Shih Chih, on the steamer _Tung Ting_,\r\nsailed between the new navy of the rebels on patrol of the great river,\r\nwhich was now their six hundred miles of front. The fine cruiser _Hai\r\nChi_, with New York Chinese among the crew, the companion cruisers _Hai\r\nYung_ and _Hai Sun_, the gunboats _Kwang Kang_, _Kwang Poa_, _On Nam_,\r\netc., headed the republican fleet, which flew the red, white and blue\r\nsun flag. The armistice was not kept in Shansi or Shensi provinces by\r\nthe imperialist general, Sheng Yun. When the pourparler opened, the six\r\npowers, at America’s suggestion, informed Wu and Tang that they would\r\nappreciate a settlement, because neither side seemed to be able to\r\nkeep down piracy, it being as bad along the Liao River in the north as\r\nalong the Si valley in the distant south. It will be recalled that the\r\nManchus of Shansi province early in the campaign assassinated the great\r\nrebel general, Wu Lu Cheng. It was now rumored that the Chinese had\r\ninduced Tuan Fang’s troops in the same province to murder that noble\r\nManchu, who was the greatest friend the foreigners had among the Manchu\r\nofficials in the dark “Boxer” days of 1900. Tuan had been governor of\r\nPechili and Szechuen provinces, head of the railway development in\r\nthe Yangtze basin, and above all head of the famous constitutional\r\ncommittee (Hsien Cheng Pien Cha Kuan), which, in 1906, went abroad to\r\nstudy foreign parliaments and congresses. He was the noblest of the\r\nManchus, a repetition in character of Prince Kung of Victorian days,\r\nand he died like a modern hero. “Kneel and be decapitated,” his troops\r\ndemanded. “You’ll shoot or cut me down where I stand,” he declared.\r\nIndividual virtue does not belong exclusively to any organization.\r\n\r\nThe rebels went on with their work in calling up troops from Premier\r\nWu Hon Man at Canton, and in equipping aeroplanes, run by Americanized\r\nChinese, for a possible air attack on Peking, if the peace conference\r\nshould break up in failure, and Hankau could be won back. The\r\nmissionaries agreed to flee to the Methodist compound which adjoined\r\nthe legation quarter in the Tartar city of Peking, on a signal being\r\ngiven by rocket. The foreigners in the northern provinces were dubious\r\nthat a republican government could be established, but it must be\r\nremembered that many of these foreigners were more surprised than the\r\nrest of the world that the reformers ever shouldered arms for reform\r\nand declared for a republic on October 10, 1911. The foreigners of\r\nthe northern provinces were accordingly at first largely in sympathy\r\nwith the retention of the Manchu, under a limited monarchy system, and\r\nthe election of Yuan as premier. Many of the foreigners of Peking and\r\nTientsin tried to impose their views upon the foreigners of Shanghai\r\nand Hongkong, who naturally knew more about the reform and republican\r\nmovement in China, for the initial reformers of China all came from\r\nCanton, Penang, Manila and Shanghai, where they were influenced by\r\nBritish Hongkong, Singapore and America. The income of the imperial\r\nauthority had been levied mainly on the southern provinces, which had\r\nleast representation on the Peking Boards (Pus) since the coup d’état\r\nof 1898. Taxation again without representation! The doubt in the minds\r\nof the reformers was that if the Manchu was retained, he might revert\r\nto his old faults of by turns oppressing China, and by turns looting\r\nit, for certain foreign concessionaires. True, said some, peace could\r\nbe fixed up now, and matters fought out again, if faith was not kept.\r\nBut, said others, by that time certain foreigners will have given Yuan\r\nShih Kai an army of forty divisions with a fortified base at Peking\r\nin touch with the Russian railway, a navy of battleships, 2,500 miles\r\nof new flanking railways down into the south, and a full exchequer\r\nbox, while the new parliaments may be without a Cromwell, a Pym, a\r\nHampden, a Jefferson, a Franklin, a Lincoln. It was a great question,\r\nthe largest any nation has ever handled, and the one answer was: “Well,\r\nthen, develop your Cromwells, Pyms, Hampdens, Jeffersons, Franklins,\r\nLincolns, out of such timber as you have in Sun, Wu, Kang, Li, etc.,\r\nand let us have peace.”\r\n\r\nThere are two things that the writer believes and prays for, viz.:\r\nthat China will remain a republic, and will become a republic\r\nbased on the worship of Christ and the study of the Christian’s\r\nBible. Such a wonderful nation of four hundred millions, preserved\r\nfrom the immemorial past as one people, must have been preserved\r\nfor some providential purpose, to put irresistible might behind\r\ncertain altruistic world ideas. Are those ideas the giving of a\r\ntruer republicanism, and a more unselfish Christianity than we have\r\nexemplified, to mankind? Japan made one irremediable and lamentable\r\nmistake; she has ignored the fact that the strength of the West is\r\nnot in fleets, but in Bible knowledge, certain trusts and occasional\r\nwars notwithstanding. It will be remembered that the secretary of the\r\nBoard of Rites, Wang Chao, recommended to the reform emperor, Kwang\r\nHsu, in 1898, that Christianity should be named as the state religion.\r\nPresident Sun and General Li of the republicans are, as I have said\r\nbefore, a Congregationalist and an Episcopalian.\r\n\r\nAs the friendly note from the six powers to the imperialists and\r\nrevolutionists at Shanghai was, at America’s and Britain’s suggestion,\r\nidentical, it was virtually a tentative recognition by the powers of\r\nthe belligerents, which happy result the latter had been trying to\r\nobtain at Minister Wu’s urgency for over two months. Yuan threatened to\r\nfight if a republic was insisted on, and he seized a great part of the\r\nManchu hoards at Peking and Tientsin, under the name of a forced loan.\r\nHe needed two million dollars a month to pay the Manchu and northern\r\nbannermen. Four of the powers were in favor of lending Yuan money, but\r\nthe rebels said, if you don’t also lend us money, we will boycott your\r\ntrade in the central and southern provinces, and you know that most of\r\nthe foreign trade emanates from Southern China, that is, your tea and\r\nsilk come from that section, and your exports go there in exchange. If\r\nyou want to know what a trade boycott by us means, ask the Japanese,\r\nwho will recall the “Tatsu Maru” incident. The rebels also threatened\r\nthat if loans were made by foreigners to the imperialists, and the\r\nrebels were successful, the latter would repudiate these loans. This\r\nwas the most brilliant move to date of the republican diplomacy. The\r\nrebels now made a surprising and broad-minded move. They wanted to\r\nsave bloodshed. They knew that a Paul converted had been made out of a\r\nstubborn Saul unconverted; that some reformers were in their day stanch\r\n“standpat machine” men! They offered Yuan the presidency of a republic,\r\nwith Sunyacius as vice-president possibly, and Wu as a possible foreign\r\nminister, until real elective assemblies could form parties, and elect\r\ntheir nominees. Yuan’s emissary at the Shanghai Conference, Tang Shao\r\nYi, was impressed with the fact that Yuan and others in North China\r\nhad no idea how strongly the republican idea had seized on the rebel\r\nprovinces. Tang, it will be remembered, is a graduate of an American\r\nuniversity, and he is even more progressive than his patron, Yuan. In\r\nmaking overtures to Yuan, Sunyacius and Wu of the rebels were showing\r\nthat they were strong and calm diplomats, who could waive a detail to\r\nwin a general cause. Recent Occidental politics exhibit no such example\r\nof the suppression of factiousness. Wu, however, did not hesitate a\r\nminute to tell the six powers that if they loaned money to the north,\r\nor interfered, they would only prolong the war indefinitely.\r\n\r\nOn December 21, 1911, the line-up was as follows. Yuan, three of\r\nthe powers and some of the world’s financial syndicates, in favor\r\nof a monarchy or war, with a loan to the north, arrayed against the\r\nrepublicans. Wu, ever persistent in demanding a republic, or renewing\r\nthe war, with a trade boycott in the southern and central provinces,\r\nagainst any foreign nation that loaned the north money. Some of the\r\nAmerican journals, surprisingly, opposed the republic. For instance,\r\non the very day that Doctor Sunyacius was named president, the New\r\nYork _Outlook_ (December 30, 1911), with snap judgment, stated that a\r\nChinese republic could, would and should not be set up at present, and\r\nfurther that “Americans would do well to throw all their influence on\r\nthe side of a constitutional monarchy”. Nine-tenths of the _Outlook’s_\r\nreaders doubtless thought that if Homer could sometimes nod, such\r\nsurprising retrogressive words as these might be forgiven the generally\r\nprogressive _Outlook_. Similarly in England, the large London house\r\nof Montagu, which has been prominent in very profitable railway loans\r\nto China under the Manchu régime, issued a circular stating its\r\n“satisfaction” when the republicans lost Hankau to General Feng, under\r\natrocious circumstances of unforgivable massacre and unnecessary arson.\r\n_Memoria longa, lingua brevis!_ Some of Britain’s diplomatic force,\r\narguing like the reactionaries of George the Third’s day, said that\r\nthey favored a monarchy because India might want a greater share in\r\nself-government than she had, forgetting that a wide-awake and fully\r\ndeveloped India meant greater trade for Britain. Three monarchical\r\nnations said that they would favor destroying the American doctrine of\r\nthe “non-partition of China” and splitting the four dependencies and\r\nthe eight provinces north of the Yellow River from the rebel provinces.\r\n\r\nNow, if ever, was the time for America to act, to give the largest\r\nand oldest nation on earth true freedom, and stop massacre and the\r\nsowing of eternal hate between the yellow and the white races. If the\r\nrepublican idea was decapitated by three of the monarchical nations\r\nwillingly, and two of the constitutional nations unwillingly, revulsion\r\nwould sweep through the camp of the republicans, and foreigners and\r\nmissionaries would be slain by the mobs, who always act before they\r\nthink the important second time. This was just what the plotting\r\nManchus had been endeavoring to bring about since October 10, 1911.\r\n“Make the republicans, or the mob in their provinces, massacre;\r\nthat will bring in foreign interference, which will save the Manchu\r\ndynasty.” In return, the Manchus promised certain foreign interests\r\nalmost any concessions which they might ask for. They could loot China,\r\nthe mineral Eldorado of the ages, and exploit the labor host of a new\r\nGoshen. _Perfide!_ ye who are retroactive at this late day after all\r\nthe lessons of the crowded past, and who love Money more than Man.\r\nHail! American republic, the mother of republics, and hail, too, the\r\ngerminating Chinese republic! Even Count Okuma, the most liberal of the\r\nJapanese, the founder of the enlightened Waseda University, of whom\r\nmost sympathy was expected with China’s effort for freedom, came out\r\nwith a pessimistic article at this time, prophesying the “failure of\r\nthe republic, years of degeneration, and an inevitable new dynasty”.\r\nDid he mean that Japan would supply one, after first absorbing two\r\nprovinces of Manchuria?\r\n\r\nYuan, the dictator, began moving his divisions, the Twentieth, now rid\r\nof its reform general, Chang Shao Tsen, being sent from the Lanchow\r\ncamp to a point north of Tientsin, to split the republicans of the\r\nthree provinces of Manchuria from joining the republicans of Shangtung.\r\nSunyacius, with Premier Wu Hon Man, of Canton, now left Hongkong for\r\nShanghai, and the world stood back and waited for the lightning to\r\ncome out of the clouds. The half million Chinese of British Hongkong\r\ngave them a rousing send-off, which was at heart approved by the five\r\nthousand British merchants and troops of Hongkong, for Hongkong knew\r\nwhat a trade boycott in the southern provinces meant. Canton had now\r\nstruck a swinging pace, and Premier Wu had sent bodies of troops,\r\nparticularly his fine artillery and bomb-throwers, to strengthen the\r\ntwo wings of the rebels under Generals Li, Ling and Hsu at Wuchang and\r\nNanking, respectively. Among these troops were one thousand students\r\nrecruited by the Fong Yuen College at Canton. God send great things to\r\nearth! God save liberty for China, and keep progress from slipping back\r\na thousand years!\r\n\r\nSo far, the strongest move in the rebellion was the declaration\r\nof Foreign Minister Wu Ting Fang that if Britain joined the three\r\nmonarchical powers in loaning Yuan money, a trade boycott would be\r\ninstituted in the southern and central provinces against foreign\r\ntrade, of which Britain held the largest share. This won Hongkong, and\r\nHongkong was able to hold British diplomacy on Downing Street, London,\r\nand indirectly on Legation Street, Peking. It was a master move, as\r\nbrilliantly effective as Napoleon’s Berlin Decree of November 21,\r\n1806, blockading British commerce, and only for it the rebellion would\r\nhave been swamped by four of the six nations arming and provisioning\r\nYuan, the Manchu and the north. Whatever comes in the next few years,\r\nthis cry surely is forever in the heart of Lincoln’s and Washington’s\r\nAmerica: “Long live the republican idea of distributed wealth and\r\ndistributed liberty in good old China, America’s yellow brother\r\nacross the narrowing purple Pacific.” On Christmas day, 1911, the\r\nsteamship _Cleveland_, from New York and San Francisco, with five\r\nhundred American world tourists, arrived at Hongkong. The republican\r\narmy immediately invited them to Canton to see their barracks at the\r\nFive Hundred Genii Temple and elsewhere, the resolution saying: “as\r\nAmerica was the first country to become a republic.” Auspiciously on\r\nDecember 26th, Sun Yat Sen arrived at Shanghai, two war-ships escorting\r\nhis launch up the river from the Wusung bar. He immediately took an\r\nautomobile at the bund wharf and proceeded to Wu’s residence, where\r\nconferences were held, and Nanking decided on as the provisional\r\ncapital of the fighting republic. The republican Chinese were delighted\r\nthat the Americans had eleven war-ships at Shanghai.\r\n\r\nOn December 26th, Yuan and the Manchu princes wired Tang Shao Yi from\r\nPeking that they would leave the decision as to a form of government\r\nto a national convention of the twenty-one provinces, the delegates\r\nto meet as soon as possible. The harmony which prevailed in the\r\nconferences at Shanghai between Sun, Wu and Li’s representatives\r\nwas delightful to those interested in Chinese progress. The harmony\r\nwhich prevailed between the missionaries and the revolutionists was\r\nalso inspiring. In a village of Hupeh province (Taiping) the people\r\ninsisted that Mr. Landahl, of the Netherlands Mission, should head\r\nthe local Safety League which was maintaining order, and they pushed\r\nthat astonished gentleman to the head in the successful pursuit of\r\nnotorious pirates who were injuring the causes of both revolutionists\r\nand imperialists. One notorious brigand of Honan province, named Wang,\r\ncollected a band of 2,000 robbers, and at Harbin in Manchuria a band\r\nof Hunghutz captured an imperial treasure train with half a million\r\nof money. Vast preparations should now have been made to protect\r\nChinese and foreigners in the north from massacre, if the National\r\nAssembly should on convening declare for a republic. There could not\r\nbut be bitterness when only 17 million Manchus abdicated the rule of\r\n400 millions Chinese, and the widest and most absolute throne the\r\nearth has known, wider than Pharaoh’s, Alexander’s, Xerxes’, Cæsar’s,\r\nCharlemagne’s, Baber Mogul’s, or Tsar’s. The problem of ruling 17\r\nmillion Manchu discontents was a greater one than the long dominion\r\nwhich the subsidized Manchus had enjoyed over 400 millions of disunited\r\nand supine Chinese. The republic of China has mighty problems before\r\nit. Let all the world help her; above all, let education, hope and\r\ncreature comforts be bestowed as quickly as possible. There is glorious\r\naltruistic work ahead of everybody for the whole of one’s life.\r\n\r\nAs the republicans solidified their government about Nanking, the\r\nenemies of China--the land-grabbing nations--who forgot their old\r\nantipathies and quarrels and acted in accord in their scheme of\r\naggrandizement, prepared to strip her of her vast dependencies,\r\nRussia towering over Turkestan, Mongolia and Northern Manchuria, and\r\nJapan gathering about Lower Manchuria, a secret treaty between the\r\ntwo having been effected. No place was to be reserved for the great\r\nChinese people to accommodate their emigration, as the size of farms\r\nshould be necessarily increased throughout the land. The American and\r\nBritish doctrine of the “non-partition of China” was to be struck\r\ndown. America, Britain and China will remember, for a Chinese republic\r\ncan yet gather an army of millions to take these provinces back, and\r\nAmerican and British naval forces, as a world’s altruistic police,\r\ncan, if necessary, stand at the doors of the Baltic and Black Seas and\r\nremind Russia of her broken promises and greed. What a conflict there\r\nwill yet be, won either by a swamping emigration, or by an engulfing\r\narmy, as Russia, Japan and China come nearer together in the old\r\nChinese dependencies of Turkestan, Mongolia and Manchuria. Mongolia,\r\nwith her capital at Urga, and Turkestan, with her capital at Kashgar,\r\npractically seceded on December 29th under Russian intrigue. Religious\r\nKhans and Lamas, named by Russia, drove the Chinese ambans out and took\r\ncharge, a Russian railway policy to break across country and control\r\nPeking being at once planned. The Manchu dynasty, with a following of\r\nfrom ten to seventeen million Manchus, sheltered in either Mongolia,\r\nPechili province, Shangtung or Manchuria, under the egis of either\r\nRussia, Japan, or other nations, will always be a covert weapon for\r\nintrigue, which the bureaucrats of those nations can use against a\r\nChinese republic.\r\n\r\nOn December 29th, the military convention at Nanking--one vote to a\r\nprovince--voted unanimously for Sun Yat Sen as the first president of\r\nthe provisional republic, until elective assemblies could meet. The\r\ncivil delegates from fourteen of the provinces, meeting at Shanghai,\r\nalso agreed on Sun Yat Sen as provisional president. The armistice\r\nwas now extended, President Sun calling upon the imperialists to\r\nrespect the neutral zone between the opposing armies. The rise of\r\nPresident Sun was astounding and his task immense. From an impoverished\r\npropagandist and exile, wandering over the earth for a whole lifetime,\r\nwith the Bible in one hand and _Progress and Poverty_ in the other, he\r\nsuddenly became the head of the largest nation upon the earth, and the\r\ngovernment of that nation he was expected to change from being the most\r\nabsolute monarchy into the freest of republics. His career is the most\r\ninspiring example that was ever presented to reformers in the world’s\r\nhistory. They say of typhoons and of troubles, that when things are at\r\ntheir worst, only a change for the better can be looked for, and so it\r\nhas been with President Sun’s career.\r\n\r\nAt the peace conferences at Shanghai, the imperialists pressed for some\r\nnorthern city as the venue of the convention of provincial delegates,\r\nand the republicans pressed as strongly for Shanghai, because in\r\ndistinction from Peking, it was removed from Russian influence. Yuan\r\nrefused to disband his army and gave notice that if the republicans\r\nadvanced, he would order an attack. The imperialists then tried to get\r\nthe republicans to agree to pay the northern troops a sum of money\r\nin return for laying down their arms, but the republicans wisely\r\nrefused to provision the imperialists in this way for a continuance\r\nof the fighting. They did, however, offer to pay for the surrender of\r\nartillery and ammunition. Yuan held many fruitless conferences with the\r\nManchu princes and dowager, offering to continue the war if they would\r\ngive up their hoards, but of the hundreds of millions of dollars of\r\ntheir wealth, all he could get was a subscription of $100,000 from the\r\nold lion, Prince Ching, who has been the mentor of the Manchus since\r\nPrince Kung died in the 60’s. The whole of the south, in emulation\r\nof the Christian president, Doctor Sun (Sunyacius), began cutting\r\noff their queues and wearing khaki, as a sign that servility to the\r\nManchus was ended. Committees of persuasion, the members of which\r\ncarried shears, operated even in Yaumati and Kowloon (mainland sections\r\nof Hongkong colony). The Chinese were approached and asked to go to\r\nthe barbers. If they refused, shears were drawn and the ancient badge\r\nof servitude to the Manchu, the queue, was severed. The Chinese of\r\nBangkok, Siam, were humorous in their methods. The republican tri-color\r\nwas hoisted to the peak, and two hundred sheared queues were hoisted\r\nunder it, up the flagpole! Doctor Sun, president, named the following\r\nas his provisional cabinet:\r\n\r\nVice-President, General Li Yuen Heng, commander of the republican left\r\nwing;\r\n\r\nPremier, Hwang Hing, organizer in Japan of the rebellion;\r\n\r\nMinister of Justice, Wu Ting Fang, formerly Minister to the United\r\nStates, and reformer of the Chinese penal code;\r\n\r\nMinister of Communications, Posts and Commerce, Wen Tsung Yao, American\r\neducated, formerly Amban in Tibet, unusually able official;\r\n\r\nColonial Secretary, Fung Chi Yueh, represented Sun in the United States;\r\n\r\nSecretary of State, Wu Hon Man, President Canton Assembly;\r\n\r\nMinisters of Finance, Chin Tao Chen, and M. Y. Sung, Manager Chung Hua\r\nrebel bank. I know both well.\r\n\r\nMinister of Navy and Marine, General Hwang Hing, second in command\r\nat Hankau, and Sun’s personal representative while he was absent in\r\nAmerica and England;\r\n\r\nForeign Minister, Wang Chung Wei, American educated;\r\n\r\nChief of Staff, General Hsu, the victor of Nanking.\r\n\r\nThe subject of adopting the Christian calendar was discussed and\r\ndecided on, though it was decided to please Chinese pride by letting\r\nthe republican bank-notes, issued in December, stand. These notes went\r\nback to mythological times, and named 1911 as the 4609th year since the\r\nfirst Emperor Huang Ti! The custom of dating the year with each Manchu\r\nemperor’s succession was of course at once discarded in fourteen of\r\nthe rebelling provinces. President Sun assumed charge at Nanking and\r\nimmediately collected a strong garrison in the old capital of China.\r\nIn his former work, _The Chinese_, the author strongly recommended\r\nthe change of the capital of China farther south so as to be nearer\r\nthe center of China, closer in touch with the majority of the people\r\nwho popularly desire the change, and safely removed from Russian\r\ninfluence and possibility of attack by Mongolian railway. Preparations\r\nwere at once made to bring finance, education, army, navy and a\r\nfederal government under the control of the coming parliament, the\r\nprovincial parliaments already being in tentative operation in half of\r\nthe provinces. We have already quoted the text of notes issued by the\r\nrepublican government of Kwangtung province. Dictator Yuan, at Peking,\r\nin a temporary huff, wired that he would not recognize Tang Shao Yi as\r\nhis representative any more at the Shanghai and Nanking conferences,\r\nand that he would only confer by telegram. He demanded that Peking,\r\nand not Nanking, should be named as the meeting place of the proposed\r\nnational assembly, which was to select the form of government. This\r\nreally broke up the peace conferences, and Wu Ting Fang so informed the\r\nforeign governments.\r\n\r\nYuan then called upon the Manchu princes and royalty for money, saying\r\nthat if they would draw two millions a month for six months from their\r\nforeign banks, he could carry on the war. Fearing that the republicans\r\nwould send an army by sea from Shanghai to Chin Wang Tao (where the\r\nGreat Wall and Peking railway meet the sea, and the only ice free\r\nport in the north) to break Manchuria from the north, and march on\r\nPeking, Yuan sent an army to Chin Wang Tao, but several of the Chinese\r\nregiments rebelled. The republicans had arranged for such a transport\r\nservice, as they had seized the ships of the government steamship line,\r\nthe China Merchants’ Steamship Company. At the Lanchow camp east of\r\nPeking, several Chinese regiments also rebelled, and there was much\r\nbloodshed in putting down the riots. Yuan had five strong northern\r\narmies, one under General Feng at Hanyang, one under Chang the Second\r\nnorth of Nanking on the railway, one under Sheng Yun operating in\r\nShensi and Shansi provinces, and an army in both Shangtung and Honan\r\nprovinces. It looked as though the war would continue, the republican\r\nstrength being mainly in that they threatened, if successful, to\r\nrepudiate any loans made after January 1, 1912, by foreigners to the\r\nManchus. Hongkong now sent the One Hundred and Twenty-sixth Indian\r\nRegiment of Baluchis, a battalion of the Yorkshires and a battery\r\nof English garrison artillery to Shameen Island, Canton, to protect\r\nthe famous foreign settlement and assist President Wu, of Canton, in\r\nmaintaining order. The island was fortified with sand-bags and barbed\r\nwire entanglements. The Hongkong Chinese were enthusiastic for a\r\nrepublic, and the British government did not prohibit their rejoicing.\r\nTheir processions included the use of automobiles and brass bands. What\r\na changed Hongkong, which used to hide its head in a monster dragon and\r\nparade the streets!\r\n\r\nPresident Sun now informed foreigners that while he could employ them\r\nin all the remainder of China’s development, he could not do so in the\r\nrepublican army, as the republicans desired to be free of suspicion,\r\nand did not want to create foreign entanglements or embarrassments. The\r\nforeign nations divided up the Tientsin-Peking railway, and foreign men\r\nof war, independent of the republican navy, patrolled the whole rebel\r\nfront from Shanghai to Hankau. Germany despatched another full regiment\r\nto Tsingtau in addition to the large garrison already there, America\r\nalone up to January 7, 1912, had held her troops at Manila. When the\r\nimperialists were evacuating Hanyang on January 4th, a regiment broke\r\nparole, necessitating an attack by General Li’s republicans, which\r\nattack was promptly and effectively sent in. On the right wing the\r\nrepublicans advanced up the Nanking-Tientsin railway, forcing General\r\nChang the Second to withdraw to the north. President Sun was now active\r\nin appeals to the foreigners for recognition of the republic, his\r\nmanifesto of January 5th, reading as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Treaties of Manchus up to October 13, 1911, will be observed.\r\n\r\n2. Concessions granted by Manchus up to October 13, 1911, will be\r\nrespected.\r\n\r\n3. Foreign loans and indemnities incurred by Manchus up to October 13,\r\n1911, will be recognized.\r\n\r\n4. Foreigners and their property will be protected by the republic.\r\n\r\n5. Manchus and their property will be protected by the republic.\r\n\r\n6. We will remodel laws; revise civic, criminal, commercial and mining\r\ncodes; reform finances; abolish restrictions on trade and commerce;\r\ninsure religious toleration; and cultivate better relations with\r\nforeign peoples and governments.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that President Sun does not here take up that\r\ndifficult question, the nationalization of railways, the premature\r\nforcing of which by the five banking nations on the Manchus largely\r\nprecipitated the preliminary revolution in Szechuen province in\r\nSeptember, 1911. When the republican finances will permit just\r\ncompensation of provincial owners of railways, the nationalization of\r\ntrunk railways will be a proper and opportune project, but confiscation\r\nof railways by a promissory note at sixty per cent. of investment, as\r\nwas offered by the Manchus to the Kwangtung province owners, can only\r\nbring revolt. By the end of the first week in January, 1912, certain\r\nof the banking groups and powers, fearing that there would be a long\r\ncivil strife, attacked the American doctrine of the “non-partition\r\nof China” and canvassed for two Chinas, the northern section to be\r\nretained by the Manchu monarchy, or a republic with Yuan at the head.\r\nEven this would bring its difficulties. To mention one of a thousand,\r\nwhere would the dividing line be, the Yellow River or the Yangtze\r\nRiver? The feeling of the republicans on this division can be gaged\r\nby asking what was the feeling of the Americans on the subject of\r\nsecession. On January 8th the republicans approved a heavy bond issue,\r\nbased on internal revenue (the customs being already pledged by the\r\nManchus for foreign loans made before October 13, 1911, which loans\r\nthe republicans recognized), and bearing eight per cent. It was also\r\ndecided to put the currency on a gold basis, and though one-dollar,\r\nfifty-cent and subsidiary silver coins would be issued, they were to be\r\nonly tokens, and their face value was to be secured by a gold reserve,\r\nas in the case of America’s and Japan’s silver coinage, which is only a\r\ntoken system.\r\n\r\nOn January 12, 1912, Major-General Franklin Bell despatched on the\r\ntransport _Logan_ from Manila the First Battalion of the Fifteenth\r\nInfantry, under Major Arrasmith, to take care of that part of the\r\nPeking-to-the-coast railway allotted to the Americans. This was a\r\nconfession of two things: first, that the Manchus might not be able\r\nto restrain the “Boxer” mobs in the north, and second, that it was\r\nexpected that the republicans would be able to come north with their\r\nthree old and two new armies when hostilities should be opened. Part\r\nof General Bell’s thrilling and characteristic American speech to the\r\ntroops should be quoted: “The Chinese are worthy of a square deal.\r\nTreat them in a worthy way.” The expedition was a trying one, and was\r\nprovided with cords of fire-wood. The enervated troops left the hot\r\nhumid climate of Manila for the cold windy climate of North China. The\r\nnews that came from the Lanchow camp at this time was most distressing,\r\nto the effect that Yuan’s imperialists were massacring and torturing\r\nrepublicans by the fiendish lin chee (cutting into a thousand pieces,\r\nthe victim being placed in a cage). Men who had adopted the republican\r\nbadge of the New China by cutting off their queues were being slain.\r\nEven the Red Cross attendants were attacked. Clearly the Manchu troops\r\nat Lanchow had gone out of hand and become a mob. The American Bishop\r\nBashford now telegraphed from Shanghai to Dictator Yuan, urging the\r\nManchus to abdicate for humanity’s sake. General Hwang Hing, minister\r\nof war, was now arranging for five republican armies to march north and\r\nconverge on Peking. These armies were:\r\n\r\nGeneral Li, with the left wing, from Hankau to Peking, through Honan\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nGenerals Hsu and Ling, with the right wing, from Nanking, through\r\nKiangsu and Shangtung provinces, along the railway.\r\n\r\nA new army, by transport and cruisers, from Shanghai to Chifu, or some\r\nnorthern port.\r\n\r\nA new army of Canton and Hupeh troops to march north in General Li’s\r\nrear.\r\n\r\nThe combined republican forces of Shensi and Shansi provinces to march\r\nnortheast.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese are exceedingly excitable when aroused from their usually\r\nplacid state. This is because their experience is limited, and they\r\nhave not yet learned to adapt themselves rapidly to new conditions.\r\nThey therefore commit suicide in surprising numbers under the sudden\r\npressure of anger, shame, poverty, trouble, uncertainty and fear.\r\nAt this time of revolution, especially in the northern provinces\r\nof Shensi and Shansi where the republicans were strongly opposed,\r\nmany officials, widows of soldiers and the poor, jumped into wells,\r\nswallowed balls of opium, or begged their friends to strangle them.\r\n\r\nOn January 15th, the republicans sent three cruisers and three\r\ntransports, with three battalions, machine and mountain guns, from\r\nShanghai to Chifu, in preparation for a converging attack on Peking,\r\nAmerica sent in the cruiser _Cincinnati_, and the Japanese sent in two\r\ncruisers to watch proceedings and protect the foreign colony, which,\r\nhowever, was not menaced. On January 19th, Foreign Minister Wang\r\nChung Wei sent a despatch to the powers, requesting recognition of\r\nthe republic “to avoid a disastrous interregnum”. On the same day the\r\nrepublic from Shanghai sent the following drastic demand to Yuan and\r\nthe Manchus:\r\n\r\n1. Abdicate.\r\n\r\n2. No Manchu to participate in the provisional government until the\r\ncountry is quiet.\r\n\r\n3. The provisional capital can not be Peking.\r\n\r\n4. Yuan can not participate in the provisional government until the\r\nrepublic has been recognized.\r\n\r\nPresident Sun gave the Associated Press this statement:\r\n\r\n1. I have taken an oath to oust the Manchu rulers and restore peace to\r\nthe country before resigning.\r\n\r\n2. I have taken an oath to establish a republic in China, and if I\r\nconsented to the proposal laid down by Yuan (to resign and put him in\r\ncharge) I would be foresworn. I am convinced that a republic is not\r\nonly practicable, but that it would be the best thing for China. Those\r\n(monarchical nations and syndicates) asserting otherwise know nothing\r\nabout the Chinese. This republic is now an established fact. Nothing\r\ncan swerve me from what I consider my duty to my fellow countrymen.\r\nUndoubtedly the best thought unanimously supports the republic.\r\n\r\n3. China can not allow outsiders to dictate as to her form of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n4. There is no question of North and South China; it must be One China.\r\n\r\n5. We are confident of the righteousness of our cause and the\r\nsuperiority of the military strength of the republicans. If Yuan Shih\r\nKai persists in obstructing, our armies will be instructed to march\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\nOn January 21st the Manchus persisted in not abdicating, and\r\ncontemplated appointing the minister of war, Yin Tchang, and the\r\npresident of the War Board, Tieh Liang, both Manchus of the ultra type,\r\nas dictators over Yuan. This was in contravention of the agreement\r\nof Nineteen Constitutional Articles between the Manchus and the old\r\nNational Assembly, pressed by the soldiers of the Lanchow camp in\r\nOctober, 1911, that no Manchus were to be placed in authority until a\r\nconstitutional government was established.\r\n\r\nWhile the world was watching the camps of war, where the men stamped\r\neager for blood, two million women and children, in three other parts\r\nof the land were starving from flood, famine and the absence of their\r\nbread providers. Look on the map at the old bed of the Yellow River\r\nacross the middle of Kiangsu province; the valley of the Hwei River\r\nacross northern Nganhwei province, emptying into Lake Hangsu; and Wuhu,\r\non the Yangtze, where the flooded river tried to break east across\r\nthe flat country to Shanghai, instead of arching north to Nanking.\r\nNot since 1906 have crops or homes been long above water in these\r\ncrowded districts. What the missionaries mainly, and others (native\r\nand foreign) of the Central China Relief Committee, with headquarters\r\nat Shanghai, have done, a library of books could not adequately tell.\r\nPart of the story would be the relief trains of gift flour which left\r\nMinneapolis and was transported free across the Pacific by the United\r\nStates army transport _Buford_; and more of the story would be the work\r\nof the American Red Cross; the grand missionary periodicals of America;\r\nand the Pacific Coast Chambers of Commerce, which put business aside\r\nfor philanthropy. Their altruism, their manly effectiveness, their\r\nhuman kindness that has been so deeply Christian and Confucian (as you\r\nlook at it from both an Occidental and an Oriental standpoint) has been\r\nmoving beyond words, and it is largely owing to this action on the part\r\nof America that the hand of the war-inflamed Chinese was stayed against\r\nforeigners in this campaign. Their women said: “Don’t strike the white\r\nphysicians and bread-givers; the men who speak in mercy and are clothed\r\nin altruism.” The soldiers of the Eighth Division of Hupeh men, under\r\nGeneral Li, at Wuchang, in bidding the American Episcopal missionaries\r\ngood-by, cheered them with these words: “Americans are our brothers.”\r\nNever had such a scene of suppressed emotion and earnestness occurred\r\nin China. I have already recited General Li’s manifesto to his men\r\nconcerning the treatment of missionaries. None was more surprised than\r\nthe good missionaries themselves. From their experience in the “Boxer”\r\ncampaign of 1900, the missionaries expected unflinching loyalty from\r\ntheir converts, but they did not look for the highest Geneva Convention\r\namenities from the new levies of the revolutionary soldiers. It was\r\nreally astonishingly delightful. But on second thought, it might have\r\nbeen seen that it was only the first fruits of the seed sown long ago\r\nby the missionaries themselves, and now being garnered after many days\r\nwhen the sowing had been almost forgotten.\r\n\r\nReports came from Peking that the boy emperor, Pu Yi, was utterly\r\nunconscious of trouble and the tottering of the oldest and widest\r\nthrone on earth, in all this ebb and flow of war and intrigue. Deserted\r\nby his guardians, parent and tutors, he was left most of the time in\r\nthe Forbidden City with eunuchs, who humored his every whim, with\r\nthe result that his temper took on true Manchu characteristics. When\r\nopposed, he threw the first thing at hand at those near him. When\r\nthe food displeased him, he cracked the dishes over the heads of his\r\nkneeling servitors. The _Break-Up of China_ indeed, but by another\r\nauthor than Lord Charles Beresford!\r\n\r\nOn January 26, 1912, the armies got in motion again, one corps leaving\r\nTsinan, the capital of Shangtung province, to checkmate the republican\r\nexpedition which had landed at Chifu. Up the Nanking-Tientsin railway,\r\nGeneral Chang the Second, of the imperialists, and General Hsu met in\r\nan engagement at Kucheng, in northern Nganhwei province, and the former\r\nwas defeated. At Wuchang, General Li’s Hupeh forces, reinforced with\r\nCantonese troops, got in motion to meet General Feng’s imperialists\r\nup the Peking-Hankau railway. Large consignments of Mauser and Krag\r\nrifles and ammunition for Krupp guns, ordered from German firms for the\r\nimperialists, on this day passed through St. Petersburg on their way\r\nto Peking by the Siberian railway. On January 28th, the provisional\r\nrepublican Senate of forty-two members (three each from fourteen rebel\r\nprovinces) convened at Nanking in foreign clothing and without queues.\r\nA remarkably enthusiastic scene occurred at the close of President\r\nSun’s address, which address urged unity. The members all rose and\r\ncheered for the republic, while a modern band played martial music. The\r\nrepublicans for the first time in modern history instituted the use of\r\na remarkable regiment of bomb-throwers. They went to the front with\r\nlarge canvas bags of dynamite bombs hanging from their shoulders. It\r\nrequired exceptional bravery to enlist in such a corps, as when a bag\r\nwas hit by an imperialist’s bullet, the explosion not only shattered\r\nthe bomb-thrower, but detonated the bags of his fellows if they were\r\nnear. This corps was uniformed in the British military peaked cap, and\r\nthey wore tunics and puttees, and had no queues.\r\n\r\nBy February 3, 1912, the Manchus had fully discussed abdication. It\r\nwas proposed that the sacerdotal succession should be maintained,\r\nthus continuing the famous Chou and Confucian sacrifices and ancestor\r\nworship among the Manchus. This would reduce the Manchu emperor to\r\na Confucian pope, similar to the Mikado before he conquered the\r\nShoguns, and similar to the Taoist pope at Lung Hu Mountain, in Kiangsi\r\nprovince, and the Buddhist popes at Urga, in Mongolia, and Lhasa,\r\nin Tibet. The Manchus also stipulated that their hereditary titles\r\nshould remain. This was a foolish move, as it removed them more than\r\never from participation and influence in the social body, just as the\r\nprivate retention of titles keeps the descendants of the old French\r\nnobility hopelessly divorced from power in republican France. The\r\nrepublicans again offered Yuan Shih Kai the presidency, with Sun Yat\r\nSen as premier, this being a union of the democratic principles in the\r\nAmerican and British systems. Yuan was inclined to insist on a dual\r\nrepublic, but the Nanking republicans insisted that Yuan should come\r\nto Nanking. The republicans under Generals Hsu and Ling now advanced\r\ntheir right wing, striking General Chung Fung of the imperialists, at\r\nSiuchow, in northern Kiangsu province, and winning a great victory.\r\n\r\nI have said that the most brilliant diplomatic move of the republicans\r\nwas that by Wu Ting Fang, who announced in December, 1911, that if any\r\nforeign syndicate or nation made loans to the Manchus, the republicans,\r\nif successful, would repudiate those loans. The most brilliant\r\nstrategic move of the republicans was made in November, 1911, when\r\nGeneral Li induced Admiral Sah’s navy to join the republican cause.\r\nThis enabled the republicans to hold the large commercial fleet of the\r\nChina Merchants’ Steamship Company, and it was on this latter fleet\r\nthat the republicans were able to raise a loan in February, 1912, from\r\nHongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, when they were at their\r\nwits’ end where to find money to balance the subscriptions which the\r\nManchus had made from their hoards, and the money which they were\r\ndrawing from the cash tills of the rich imperial railways of North\r\nChina. The Nippon Yusen Kaisha tried to buy out the China Merchants’\r\nSteamship Company so as to give Japan dominance in the China coastal\r\ntrade, but Britain interposed. The republicans had only one little\r\nrailway from Shanghai to Hangchow, 104 miles, whose surplus earnings\r\ncould help them, as compared with the 4,000 miles of successful railway\r\nin the territory controlled by the Manchus.\r\n\r\nAs neither Manchu nor Yuan could hold Manchuria, Japan now advanced a\r\nbattalion to Mukden, a measure pregnant with precedents and controversy\r\nin the future. America maintained her reputation for altruism,\r\nSecretary Knox, on February 3rd, addressing the German ambassador a\r\nnote to the effect that America’s idea was that all the powers should\r\nrestrain their nationals from interfering with loans as much as with\r\narms in China. The powers which were inclined to break leash were\r\nJapan, Russia and Belgium. The southern republican navy found the\r\ninternational forces and legations a bar in the way of the capture\r\nof Peking. The navy was off Chin-wang-tao, the only open port on the\r\nLiaotung Gulf, in February, 1912, and was ready to transfer the fifth\r\nrepublican army from Chifu. As long as Peking was dignified with the\r\nlegation staffs of foreigners, the prestige of the foreigner supported\r\nto that extent the cause, or rather the integrity of the imperial\r\nnorth, and the rebels hesitated to send their attack home on account\r\nof international complications. Again and again the republicans asked\r\nfor recognition and the transfer of the legations to Nanking. America\r\nonly gave any attention to this request, sending Doctor Tenny, of the\r\nPeking legation staff, to pay an unofficial call on and make unofficial\r\ninspection of the republican government at Nanking. Japan and Russia\r\nclosed their fists tighter on South and North Manchuria, respectively,\r\nlending money right and left to industrials and mines and thus\r\nestablishing a mortgage and excuse for remaining in case of a break-up.\r\n\r\nWherever the capital is to be, whichever faction is to control,\r\nwhatever style of government is to win, it does not seem impossible\r\nthat the free China of the future will have fewer internecine conflicts\r\nand rows than the England, America or France of history. Liberty goes\r\nthrough about the same birth pangs whether she is born white, brown,\r\nblack or yellow! On February 11, 1912, (probably at Yuan’s private\r\nsuggestion), forty-eight generals of the imperial army wired Yuan\r\nthat they would fight no more for the Manchus, so that the seed of\r\nthe Lanchow camp had finally spread into a whole forest. The official\r\nbirth of the Chinese republic came on Lincoln’s birthday (think of it,\r\nAmerica!), February 12, 1912, the abdication decree of the Manchus\r\nincluding the following sentence: “Let Yuan organize to the full the\r\npowers of the provisional republican government, forming a great\r\nrepublic with the union of Manchus, Chinese, Mongols, Mohammedans and\r\nTibetans.” President Sun Yat Sen telegraphed Canton in particular to\r\naccept Yuan, and another telegram instructed all Chinese consuls abroad\r\nto adopt foreign dress. The United States at once arranged to recognize\r\nunofficially both the northern and southern provisional Chinese\r\nrepublics under Presidents Yuan and Sun respectively, until a national\r\nassembly could form a united government.\r\n\r\nOn February 15th, the Christian Chinese provisional president, Sun Yat\r\nSen, performed a remarkable act of self-sacrifice to win the north for\r\nrepublicanism and induce Yuan to join the great cause. He also was able\r\nto induce the vehement south to accept the former reactionary Yuan.\r\nDoctor Sun resigned as provisional president in favor of Yuan. The\r\nNational Assembly at Nanking paid him this tribute: “Such an example of\r\npurity of purpose is unparalleled in history. It was solely due to your\r\nmagnanimity and modesty, Doctor Sun, that northern China was won over\r\nto republicanism.” Here was the man who had achieved republicanism,\r\nlaying by all its honors in favor of the man who had longest and most\r\npowerfully withstood republicanism. Yet Sun was happy. China was happy.\r\nYuan and his aide Tang were happy. The Chinese republican navy at\r\nChifu, Shanghai and Nanking saluted the republic with a broadside, and\r\nthe Chinese legations throughout the world hoisted the new sun flag.\r\nWith the least bloodshed ever known, Sun and his cabinet had achieved\r\nthe greatest revolution ever known, and had established a republic\r\nof twenty-one republics, four times the population of America. They\r\nwill be managed by a combination of the British and American systems,\r\nas their bulk is too great for the strong centralization which is now\r\nbecoming popular in America to correct certain corporation evils.\r\nThe provincial republics will develop largely as units, until the\r\nindividual is educated sufficiently for greater cohesion. Sun Yat Sen\r\nwill go down to history as the greatest dreamer, prophet, organizer,\r\naltruist and political philosopher the modern world has known, not\r\nthat he is brainier than the white man, but being a yellow man, he\r\nhas been able to accomplish more than any white man. His reception,\r\ncertainly the reception of his cause, by the hearts of men should be\r\nenthusiastic. He stands not alone. The scores of idealists and fighters\r\nof his cabinet made the way for the constructive men who will now\r\ntake hold. Above all, he converted Yuan by his self-obliteration, and\r\nYuan converted the obstructionist north. What if the Honanese Yuan is\r\nat the head of affairs for a while instead of the Kwangtungese Sun?\r\nThey are both Chinese and both republicans. China now has the center\r\nof the world’s stage, and America has built the Panama canal to reach\r\nquickly a front seat at the stage. The actors will have long and\r\nstrenuous parts, and the house is filling up rapidly to hear, and see,\r\nand applaud, if all is done well, as it should be. Doctor Sun has done\r\nthe most for a republic. Long years ago he planned it, and he has been\r\npersecuted most by the Manchus for opinion’s sake. When the assemblies\r\nsucceed each other, his turn as president or premier will doubtless\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nKang Wu Wei had dropped into astonishing silence during all these\r\nstrenuous days, but on February 18, 1912, he suddenly and insanely\r\n(allow the emphasis) burst out in rebellion against the republic in\r\nManchuria. Yuan he opposed; Sun he opposed. Did he, and the rebelling\r\ngovernor, Chao Ehr Sun, plot then for the Manchus or the Japanese in\r\nManchuria? Why did not this first reformer Kang repress himself? Why\r\ndid not Yuan and Sun repress themselves somewhat and win him? _A bas_,\r\npersonal jealousies, antipathies or overleaping ambitions! Surely\r\nthere is room for all in twenty-one republics, which are to be bound\r\nas one commonwealth. The Chinese are intense in feeling and clannish\r\nin spirit, and they often turn vehemently on one another; their Tong\r\nwars in New York and San Francisco for instance. Thus Yuan might hate\r\nKang, and Kang have none of Yuan, whereas, according to Macaulay, “both\r\nshould serve the state”. It is this repression of individual resentment\r\nand ambition which has made England and America so governable, and it\r\nis something China will learn as the years of stress surge about the\r\nship of state. The title of captain or president amounts to very little\r\nin the light of patriotism; all are equal when it comes to manning the\r\npumps and shortening or letting out sail according to the winds that\r\nblow. Parties will arise; provincial feeling will be assertive; leaders\r\nand their followings will clash, but the Chinese must learn, as we all\r\nhave to learn, that the striving must be one way o’ the rope and not\r\na tug against each other because of personal greed, low ambition or\r\nunruliness. In hundreds of documents issued during the rebellion, the\r\nrepublicans held up two men, Washington and Napoleon, as representing\r\nsuccessful protest against tyrant kings. But Washington laid the sword\r\nby the minute statesmanship could win. Napoleon used his sword to\r\nadvance himself and crush every will except his own; the way of an\r\negotist. If China needs a foreign model to look at occasionally, let\r\nit be that of Washington, with his moderation, his unselfishness, his\r\ncharity, his honor, his true republicanism, which sees in every citizen\r\n(man or woman) a king equal to himself, for the ballot and tax receipt\r\nhave made all men equal kings!\r\n\r\nI have pointed out the inconsistencies of character in Yuan and Kang.\r\nThey may develop in other leaders from whom we expect much. It will be\r\nrecalled that the great Empress Tse Hsi alternated “Boxer” and reform\r\nedicts; the lopping off of heads, and unbinding of women’s feet; the\r\ncomposing of poems on gentleness, and teaching her sleeve dogs to run\r\nat foreigners. The greatest viceroy of Wuchang, Chang Chih Tung, wrote\r\nbooks recommending modern gun foundries and steel mills one day, and\r\nthe compulsory enthronement of worn-out Confucianism the next day,\r\nin the land which had always declared that any man could perform all\r\nreligious rites. The genial Manchu Tsai princes who were the most\r\naffable of men when the Army, Navy and Constitutional Commissions\r\nvisited England and America in recent years, were the irreconcilable\r\nRuperts who insisted on the slaughter of foreigners and non-combatants\r\nin the northern provinces during the rebellion. The venerable and\r\ncultured viceroy of Nanking, Chang, who was the first official to open\r\na modern exposition in China, was the very man who helped to hurl\r\nthat awful slaughter on the innocents, with the ruthless division of\r\nShangtung troops on November 10, 1911, at Nanking. The reform emperor,\r\nKwang Hsu, the father of the immortal progressive edicts of 1898 in the\r\n_Peking Gazette_, the possessor of the sweetest face that ever graced a\r\nChinese, was known to beat his waiters over the head with dishes, and\r\nhis aunt, the Empress Dowager Tse Hsi, whose private ambition was to be\r\nthe best painter of plum blossoms in the land, was known, according to\r\nChing Shan, the comptroller of her household, to dance in rage that was\r\nawful to behold, and which left its wake in broken crockery and clocks.\r\nThey have not as yet “lunacy commissions of three” in China, whose\r\ninfallible tests are walking the chalk-line without a corkscrew motion,\r\nrecord of screaming and throwing vases, talking to one’s self and\r\nhaving wigglety eyes at times, or men of tawny color might have been\r\nincarcerated long before fame came to them! In the same inconsistent\r\nway the Japanese Prince Ito was a constitutionalist when a student\r\nin England, and a red imperialist as a statesman in Japan and Korea.\r\nWith the Oriental it often is, “who pays for my ration, his is the\r\nflag I fly”. The larger sentimentality and altruism of republicanism\r\nwill doubtless equip the new Chinese with deeper conviction and more\r\nenduring sentiment and devotion to ideals. We call a man who is not a\r\ngood republican out of office, or a good Liberal on the left side of\r\nthe speaker’s desk at Westminster, not much of a patriot in America\r\nor England, and China and Japan must learn the Pauline admonition to\r\nTimothy regarding manliness: “Be instant in season and out of season.”\r\n\r\nOwing to deferred pay, some of General Li’s republican troops at\r\nWuchang, and General Wu’s republican troops at Canton mutinied in\r\nthe middle of February, and on February 29, 1912, regiments of the\r\nnotorious Third Division of Yuan’s northern troops mutinied at Peking,\r\npartly for the same reason, partly because they did not want Yuan\r\nto go to Nanking; but mainly all this was a recrudescence of the\r\ntricks of the Manchus to bring in foreign interference. The Manchus\r\nhad received part of their pension from the foreign loans and were\r\nillegally using it to stir up sedition. The mutineers burned a mile of\r\nhouses, stretching from the Manchu’s Forbidden City to the new Wai Wu\r\nPu Building, which is Yuan’s headquarters, and millions of dollars of\r\ntreasures were destroyed, including the historic Wu Men gate leading to\r\nthe imperial purple and yellow city. Many shopkeepers hung out signs,\r\n“Already looted; now empty” in an effort to save their buildings. The\r\nhouses occupied by Mr. Straight, the representative of the Morgan\r\nSyndicate, and by Mr. Menocal, of the American International Bank,\r\nwere looted, as were other foreign houses, but personal affront was\r\nnot offered to foreigners. The quarters occupied by the delegates from\r\nthe Union Assemblies of the south, who came from Nanking, were fired.\r\nThe reactionary troops of Yuan showed their hate of the southerners on\r\nevery possible occasion. This was his punishment for raising an army\r\nmainly in the two Manchu provinces, instead of generally enrolling it\r\nthroughout the country. These troops wanted to support the rule of the\r\nnation by an unconstitutional Privileged Minority. It would be folly\r\nto agree with their politics, and it would mean terrible bloodshed to\r\ndisagree with them.\r\n\r\nThe question they have raised is far from settled. One shell was\r\ndropped into the American legation compound. For strategic purposes,\r\nAmerican soldiers took possession of the Chien Men gate and pagoda\r\ntower, and the German troops occupied the Hatamen gate and pagoda\r\ntower, both of which overlooked the legation and Methodist Mission\r\nquarters. One thousand more foreign troops were brought up from\r\nTientsin to guard the legations. During the burning the Manchu eunuchs,\r\nwho had witnessed the 1900 siege, could be seen in the moonlight\r\ngathered on the glistening yellow roofs of the imperial palaces. It\r\nwill be recalled that this Imperial Third Division under General Feng,\r\ncommitted the uncalled-for and awful arson of Hankau in November, 1911.\r\nThe _Muse of History_ will in vain turn the pages of her index to find\r\na record in her volumes of incendiaries who surpass the reactionary\r\nThird Division, whom Yuan now locked up in their barracks. He then\r\ncalled upon the old-style Chang Ku turbaned troops to defend the city.\r\nYuan was continually showing distrust and fear of his troops; neither\r\nwould he permit the southern delegates to bring up southern troops to\r\ndefend the constitution and their liberty, nor would he permit the\r\nempress dowager and the emperor to retire from the imperial city to\r\nthe summer palace, some twelve miles distant, or to Jehol:--he said he\r\nfeared to arouse the northern troops. The southern delegates replied:\r\n“It is too bad that we deferred thoroughly whipping these northerners\r\nwhile we were at it.”\r\n\r\nOn February 29, 1912, the first partial recognition of the republican\r\ngovernment was made by the American House of Representatives,\r\nunanimously passing the Sulzer resolution congratulating the “people”\r\nof China on assuming the responsibilities of self-government. All\r\nthroughout Pechili, at Paoting, where the Anglican missionary, Mr. F.\r\nDay, was killed by a mob which was looting with the Sixth Division,\r\nat Tientsin, and throughout Shangtung province, the revolt spread, as\r\na recrudescence of the Manchuized anti-foreign or “Boxer” movement.\r\nNative Christians were assassinated or had their eyes put out. Doctor\r\nSun, at Nanking was distressed, and promised to stand by Yuan and\r\nrepublicanism. He sent telegrams to all the assemblies requesting them\r\nto be steady, and generously saying that Yuan had rendered a service\r\nby inducing the Manchus to abdicate. The situation reminded one of\r\nBurke’s description of the French revolution: “The National Assembly\r\nis surrounded by an army not raised either by the authority of their\r\ncrown or by their command, and which, if they should order to dissolve\r\nitself, would instantly dissolve them.” The new Tientsin mint was\r\nlooted. Doctor Schreyer, an eminent German physician of Tientsin, was\r\nassassinated. The American legation guard got through to Peking to\r\nthe delight of the foreigners. Foolishly none of the foreign guards\r\nbrought artillery, and the legations were therefore at the mercy of any\r\nartillery attack that the northern troops might direct against them. At\r\nFengtai, the British Somerset regiment was on guard when 1,500 Chinese\r\nmodern soldiers stopped the eastbound train. The Somersets, with the\r\ntraditional bravery of the British, gave the Chinese troops one hour\r\nto clear out. By that time the 700 British Inniskilling Fusiliers,\r\nunder command of the soldierly Colonel Hancock, were brought west,\r\ndetrained quickly, and with the Somersets, marched at once on the\r\npositions of the obstructionist Chinese troops, who found discretion to\r\nbe the better part of valor. Then the freed train started for Tientsin.\r\nThere were now 3,000 foreign troops in Peking, and on March 3rd the\r\nFifteenth American Infantry, under Major Arrasmith, led a grand march\r\nof the quarter to show Yuan’s rebelling troops that order at last\r\ncould be sustained, and Japan was called upon, as in 1900, for 5,000\r\ntroops. Hongkong and Manila were also wired to send reinforcements.\r\nThe troops of the north who had fought against the republic for four\r\nmonths, were now showing themselves to be a disgusting set of “Boxer”\r\nlooters, incendiaries, murderers and “_agents provocateurs_” for\r\nintervention. The outcome of the whole matter might be the bringing of\r\nthe remobilized southern forces north and the immediate unification\r\nof nationalism at Peking under Sun, Yuan and General Li; although the\r\nsouth at heart desires Nanking to be the capital, as it is removed from\r\nRussian influence and northern sectionalism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright, American Episcopal Church, Foreign Board, N. Y.\r\n\r\n  Military company of St. John’s American Episcopal University,\r\n    Shanghai.

The three galleries are of\r\n    marble.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAmid all the disturbance, another cloud, the size of a man’s hand,\r\nloomed up on the horizon. The Marquis Chu Cheng Yu, a lineal descendant\r\nof the Chinese Ming kings, began to canvass the rioting army for\r\nadherents. Two hundred American marines were rushed from Shanghai\r\nto Tientsin on the collier _Abarenda_, and the American fleet left the\r\nsouthern ports for Taku. The transport _Warren_ sailed from Manila\r\nwith another battalion of the Fifteenth Infantry and marines. The\r\nfour-nation bankers, with the approval of six powers, came to Yuan’s\r\nhelp with $1,000,000 loans on nine months’ warrants, to aid him in\r\nputting down mobbing and mutiny by paying off soldiers, who, however,\r\nused the money as fuel for more mutiny. It was decided to loan the dual\r\nrepublican governments at Peking and Nanking about $5,000,000 a month.\r\nSome of the old-style troops were more loyal to Yuan than were the\r\nnotorious Third Division at Peking, the Sixth Division at Paoting, in\r\nPechili province, the Second Division in Honan, and the Fifth Division,\r\nin Shangtung province, which were loyal to no cause or person. At the\r\nsame time the preliminary contract of February twenty-first, by which\r\nthe Russo-Asiatic Bank independently was to advance Sun and the Nanking\r\nrepublican organization $7,000,000, was canceled, and the four banking\r\npowers advanced Sun, at Nanking, $1,500,000 to pay off Cantonese troops\r\nand hire police. The rebellion of Yuan’s troops made many confess that\r\nthe southern republicans had probably made a mistake in not following\r\nChang the Second’s imperial forces of northern troops north in January,\r\n1912, and giving the northern army several sound thrashings until the\r\norganization was broken up.\r\n\r\nOn March 9, 1912, the irreconcilable imperial governor of Shansi and\r\nShensi provinces, General Sheng Yun, a Mongol by blood, still had\r\n15,000 troops (many of them Mohammedans) fomenting Manchu propaganda\r\nand slaying everywhere, while General Yin Tchang, at Japanese Dalny,\r\nGovernor Chao Ehr Hsun, at Mukden, and Prince Su, at Jehol and Kalgan,\r\nwere doing the same thing. What a confused state of affairs existed\r\nin the mutinous army, of the north, which was divided into five corps.\r\nGeneral Sheng’s Mohammedans were setting Shansi and Shensi provinces on\r\nfire. The corps of Imperial Guards and Manchu divisions at Peking were\r\nat heart of course for the deposed Manchu dynasty. The Mongol divisions\r\nin northern Pechili looted and decapitated and laughed at President\r\nYuan’s orders. The old-style turbaned troops of Yuan’s were loyal one\r\nday and disloyal another, and the same thing was true of divisions of\r\nterritorial Shangtung, Pechili and Honan troops of Yuan’s modern army.\r\nIn the southern provinces the republicans had a little more cohesion\r\nin the five armies of their recruited corps and their two territorial\r\narmies. In Yunnan province an entirely isolated army was marking time\r\nand had done nothing for either southern or northern cause of late. Oh!\r\nfor a strong hand to weave and hold all these cords in one cable of\r\nsome strength.\r\n\r\nOn March 10th, amid the crashing of walls and institutions, a pathetic\r\nbut inspiring scene occurred in the modern Wai Wu Pu (Foreign Office)\r\nat Peking. Yuan Shih Kai, dressed in military uniform, was formally\r\ninaugurated provisional president of the republic of China, in the\r\npresence of the Nanking assembly delegates, military and naval\r\nofficers, provincial envoys, and many foreigners. Of course, legation\r\nstaffs and missionary bodies did not attend officially. Yuan read a\r\ndeclaration promising progress, to observe the constitution, and retire\r\nwhen the National Assembly appointed a permanent president for the\r\ndecided term, if he himself was not chosen. Two yellow robed Lamas\r\nfrom the Buddhist temple stepped up, presented Yuan with two honorary\r\nscarfs and called him, in Pekingese, “Da Dsoong Toong” (in Cantonese,\r\nTa Tsung Tung),--the great president. It was a businesslike military\r\nscene, there being very little of Oriental display or the gorgeous\r\nrobes of old. Tang Shao Yi was named premier. President Yuan signalized\r\nhis assumption of office by pardoning all prisoners, except murderers\r\nand robbers, remitting all overdue land taxes and announcing that for\r\nthe present the old laws would stand, except where they were obviously\r\ncontrary to the spirit of republicanism.\r\n\r\nThe new constitution provided that the supreme power was in the hands\r\nof the National Assembly; that all acts of the president required\r\nthe approval of the assembly, that the cabinet was answerable to\r\nthe assembly; and that the assembly was to elect the president and\r\nvice-president, and have power to pass laws over the executive veto.\r\nThis was vastly different from Japan’s stultified parliamentarism,\r\nand was a union of the American system of the lower house being\r\nsupreme, and of the British executive efficiency obtainable from a\r\nsmall cabinet. Doctor Sun promised to turn over the great seal of his\r\noffice. Disorder ruled throughout the armed north, where a republic\r\nwas unpopular with the mercenary troops. Republican flags were torn\r\ndown wherever the merchants of Peking put them up. The rebelling\r\ntroops decapitated the crowd by thousands at Peking, Tientsin, Kalgan,\r\nPaoting, and throughout Shansi, Shensi and Pechili provinces. So many\r\nheads and bodies lay on the street that the donkeys and mules refused\r\nto pass the heaps. Yuan himself had to add the head of the headtaker\r\nto the pile. He sent the tall, venerable General Chiang Kwei Tai with\r\nold-style turbaned Nganhwei troops, who mowed off heads right and left\r\nthrough the streets of old Peking. The famous Tongkwan pass, at the\r\nheel of the Yellow River, commanding Shensi and Honan provinces, was\r\nseized by the reactionary troops of General Sheng Yun, who compelled\r\nthe merchant guilds to pay blackmail or have their stores looted.\r\nClearly Pechili province, with its hosts of irreconcilable mercenary\r\ntroops, was the rock on which the ship of republicanism was now\r\nstranded. Yuan had to change his body-guard from day to day, one day\r\nold-style troops, another day Manchu troops, and again the champion\r\nlooters of the Third Division, but the real hand which afforded what\r\nlittle steadiness there was, was the magnificent body of foreign troops\r\nwhich amounted to 3,000 picked men.\r\n\r\nOn March 12th, Provincial President Wu Hon Man and Governor Chan\r\nKwang Ming, at Canton, were harassed by the notorious pirate chief,\r\nLuk, who was remarkably successful. Luk, through the mutiny of the\r\nsoldiers, gained the historic Bogue, Yuchu, Whampoa and Fumen forts,\r\nand the arsenal and admiralty buildings. All the foreign navies, led\r\nby the United States gunboat _Wilmington_ and the British fleet under\r\nCommander Eyres, anchored off Shameen Island, cleared for action,\r\nand the passenger steamers, on which probably every world tourist\r\nhas probably been, the _Fatshan_ and _Honan_, sailed from Canton for\r\nHongkong with two thousand passengers each. The famous old shallow\r\ndraft British gunboat _Moorhen_, the hero of a thousand pirate chases\r\nin intricate Kwangtung province waters, had her awnings and spars torn\r\nby bullets during the night, as she protected the electric station,\r\nso that the pirates could not strike Canton into midnight, and in the\r\ndark massacre along the narrow streets, the maloos and the bund. Eight\r\nhundred British and French troops patrolled the little foreign island\r\nof Shameen.\r\n\r\nBefore the days of direct primary nominations in America we suffered\r\nfrom the machine system, which advanced the incompetent and debarred\r\nthe eminent and efficient from service in the state. A saloon-keeper\r\nwho brought 2,000 votes would demand, for instance, the position of\r\nsecretary of state. “But you’re not fitted for it; you’re a hoodlum.”\r\nThe ward-heeler would answer: “I must have it; I have to pay my 2,000\r\nbrigands the ‘graft’ which we claim is ours; otherwise, remember our\r\nrevenge next election.” One Shek Kam Chuen, a young stone-cutter and\r\nhuman hair hawker of Canton, was very successful in smuggling arms\r\nfor the revolution, and on the declaration of independence, he led a\r\nfollowing of 2,000 nondescript men, who did effective work in fighting.\r\nThey were men who loved a fight more than liberty, not liberty more\r\nthan life. When the republic was victorious and his troops, after being\r\npaid, were disbanded, Shek was unsatisfied. He, a hawker, wanted high\r\noffice, when even President Sun turned his brother down from politics\r\nto business in Canton because he was not eminent for political ability.\r\nShek made demands for his men that the state could not consistently\r\ngrant. He smuggled arms to take up piracy in reprisal on the harassed\r\nstate. The way the governor of Canton treated Shek and his legal\r\nadviser, Chang Han Hing, was, under the constitutional pressure of\r\npublic opinion, to capture them at their headquarters, and under\r\nmilitary law, or the application of the popular “recall”, have them\r\nboth shot, to the great rejoicing of good citizens and taxpayers. That\r\nended one instance of heelerism, bossism, packed primary, professional\r\noffice holding, “public office a private graft”, piracy, or whatever\r\nyou like to call it, in modern China! The “Popular Recall” was a\r\nsuccess, despite the cynicism of the standpatters in Canton, and one of\r\nthose standpatters was Shek’s lawyer, Chang, who shared his client’s\r\nfate, much to his disgusted surprise. I am sorry William Dean Howells\r\nwas not in Canton at that time to write _A Modern Instance_!\r\n\r\nGeneral Wu Sum, with 2,000 republican provincial troops, left Canton\r\nfor Swatow to put down pirates operating around that noted old city,\r\nand the famous General Ling, and General Ho came down from Nanking to\r\nassist. On March 14th the irreconcilable “Boxer” Manchu leader, Prince\r\nTuan, exiled in Kansu province, raised the standard of revolt, with\r\nhis son Ku Kwei, as a pretender to the throne. He had not the moral\r\nsupport of all of the imperial clan, because he had in 1900 plotted to\r\ndisplace Prince Chun’s emperor son, “Pu Yi”. Tuan is a shrewd, able and\r\npersistent leader. If he had not been a reactionary in 1900, he might\r\nhave preserved to the Manchus a longer lease of power.\r\n\r\nThe battles of the international financiers still went on at\r\nPeking, Premier Tang Shao Yi’s action in raising $5,000,000 from a\r\nRussian-Belgian syndicate on the Chinese-built Peking-Kalgan railway,\r\nincensing the international group. Tang gave a laconic interview,\r\nmerely saying: “China need not necessarily put herself forever in the\r\nhands of four nations; we can deal with independents where we are\r\nable to find any. The loan was first offered to American bankers,\r\nbut those American bankers who are now in the Far East would not act\r\nindependently of the four nations.” Russian, Japanese and Belgian\r\nbankers seemed to fall in with Russia’s plans, as in 1896, to put\r\nChina under a financial thraldom. Russia did not want a loan given to\r\nChina for her army, as Russia and Japan both desire a weak army in\r\nChina. The four-nation bankers now offered China $300,000,000, of which\r\n$60,000,000 was to be for army purposes. If Japan joins in this loan,\r\nit will be because she does not want to be shut out of a share in\r\ncontrolling China’s finances, and an apportionment of the concessions.\r\nThe _National Review_ of Shanghai published at this time a caricature,\r\nshowing Russia pushing old China, and “Foreign Grafter” pushing New\r\nChina, out of the way, while North China, a clam, had shut its shell\r\non the beak of South China, a heron. The Chinese fable of the bird and\r\nthe shellfish was quoted as follows: “A bird attacked an open shellfish\r\non the beach; but the shellfish closed his shell with a snap, and the\r\nbird was caught. Both were then helpless, and fell an easy prey to\r\nsome covetous fishermen.” Nearly all the Japanese papers, including\r\nthe influential Tokio _Nichi_ and _Jiji_, and the Osaka _Mainichi_,\r\ncame out attacking Yuan, and endeavoring to stir up differences between\r\nNorth and South China. If Japan could prove that Chinese conditions\r\nwere unstable, there evidently would be more plausibility for Japan’s\r\npossible intervention in Manchuria! On March 16th, Premier Tang Shao Yi\r\nannounced a provisional northern cabinet as follows, until the National\r\nAssembly of seven delegates to a province could meet. None of the\r\nappointees is a Manchu.\r\n\r\nPresident, Yuan Shih Kai, a Honan man.\r\n\r\nPremier, Tang Shao Yi, Cantonese, educated at Yale University, America.\r\n\r\nArmy, General Tuan Chi Jui, Nganhwei man, once viceroy of Hunan, active\r\nin revolution.\r\n\r\nNavy, Admiral Lin Kwan Hsung, a man of considerable experience in the\r\nold and new navies, at Canton, along the Yangtze, etc.\r\n\r\nForeign Affairs, Lou Tseng Tsiang, Minister to Russia, Netherlands,\r\netc. In this appointment Yuan shows how natural it is for him to favor\r\nRussia, whom he fears.\r\n\r\nInterior, Cheo Ping Chun, a native of Hunan.\r\n\r\nEducation, Tsai Yuan Pei.\r\n\r\nRailways, Posts, etc., Liang Ju Hao, Cantonese.\r\n\r\nCommerce and Labor, Chen Chi Mei.\r\n\r\nAgriculture, Sung Chiao Fen.\r\n\r\nJustice, Wong Chun Hui, American educated, very able.\r\n\r\nFinance, Hsiung Hsi Ling, Hunan man, once in Exterior Department of\r\nHupeh province.\r\n\r\nMost of these are southern men, some of whom replied that they did\r\nnot see how they could come without a southern army to protect their\r\nlives from the loosely-held northern troops, who had no idea what\r\nconstitutional honor or promises meant. The whole of the American\r\nPacific Navy, including the fine cruisers _California_, _South Dakota_\r\nand _Colorado_, left Honolulu for the Far East, and the United States\r\nsteamer _Monterey_, on the same day, landed one hundred men at Swatow\r\nto preserve order and the tanks of the Standard Oil Company. On March\r\n19th the republican troops at Canton and Swatow gained back after\r\nsevere engagements the forts that the mutinous troops and pirates had\r\ntaken. The government at Canton bought up all the food in the shops so\r\nas to starve out Luk’s pirates. Amid all the conflict of accusation and\r\ndenial, it is fitting that Yuan Shih Kai should speak for himself, and\r\ntherefore I quote parts from his long address to the old conservatives\r\nand to the provincial governors shortly after the abdication of the\r\ndynasty, which abdication he adroitly and successfully urged when, to\r\nuse his own words, “it was well nigh impossible to make stand against\r\nthe republicans.”\r\n\r\n“From the time when I again led the troops and later when I came to\r\ncourt, I was animated with the purpose of establishing a constitutional\r\nmonarchy, but the state of the country changed. The National Assembly\r\nand the provincial assemblies all fathered the policy of not using\r\nmilitary force to put down the disturbances. When Hankau was regained,\r\nthe naval forces were lost. The moment Hanyang was reconquered, Nanking\r\nfell. The power of the government over the waterways and the sea was\r\ngone, and the sources of revenue were cut off. Although in various ways\r\nI encouraged the military to greater effort, secured the revocation\r\nof Shangtung’s declaration of independence, subdued the capitals of\r\nShansi and Manchuria, and did all in my power to prop up the North,\r\nyet the tide was too strong and swept every locality. Revolutionary\r\nsocieties among the people were scattered everywhere. At this time\r\nthere was international intervention and it was requested that in the\r\ninterests of humanity a truce be declared and negotiations undertaken.\r\nForeigners continually uttered reproof on the scores of commercial\r\ninterests and the indemnity. Because the country was in such a chaotic\r\nstate politically, it was difficult to restore order. Within there\r\nwas ruin; without there was furnished the possibility of foreign\r\nintervention. The revolutionary forces were coming by various routes\r\nto attack the North. The spirit of the army was shaken. Had the strife\r\nbeen continued, in a very short time the revolutionary army would have\r\ncome north, and in that case it would have been impossible either to\r\nfight or to negotiate for peace. What of the imperial family and the\r\nlivelihood of the bannermen? Recently the ministers of foreign nations,\r\nthe commercial associations at the ports, the different conferences,\r\nthe various troops and the provincial viceroys and governors have\r\nsent telegrams, all stating that the will of the people is bent on\r\na republic, and that it would be well-nigh impossible to make stand\r\nagainst it. Should the enemy arrive at the walls of the capital, the\r\ndisasters resulting would be unimaginable. How much better for the\r\nthrone, of its own grace, to proclaim the republic at an early date.\r\nThere was condemnation of the policy of staking the fate of their\r\nimperial majesties and the lives and property of the North on a single\r\nthrow, trusting to luck in a single battle. An edict was issued by her\r\nImperial Majesty directing me first to settle with the revolutionary\r\narmy regarding the especial consideration to be accorded the imperial\r\nfamily and the treatment of the Manchus, Mongolians, Mohammedans, and\r\nTibetans. If an agreement could be reached by the two sides, then\r\nthe imperial family might enjoy glory, and the hereditary nobility\r\namong the Manchus, Mongols, Mohammedans, and Tibetans, as well as the\r\nallowances of the bannermen, might continue without interruption. An\r\nagreement was made, resulting in the present state of affairs.”\r\n\r\nNeither Yuan nor the north has yet explained to the world the reason\r\nwhy the nobility of the Manchus, Mongols, Tibetans, etc., expect\r\ntitles and pensions, unless it be the argument that is now wearing\r\nout over the world, in nation after nation, that it is constitutional\r\nto maintain rule by a Privileged Minority over a taxed majority!\r\nYuan says: “An agreement was made resulting in the present state\r\nof affairs,” but the “present state of affairs” is not entirely\r\nsatisfactory. At times, it seems in China that Confucius has abdicated\r\nto Confusion. The solution lies in three things: railways, education,\r\nand a real republican congress, none of the three to be interfered\r\nwith by either a riotous or office-greedy army, but rather dutifully\r\nserved by a patriotic army. There can be no doubt that the action\r\nof the ninety generals of the northern army in forcing the National\r\nAssembly at Peking, in July, 1912, at the sword’s point, to accept\r\nagainst their will the second cabinet which Yuan Shih Kai had selected,\r\nand some of his foreign-advised measures, was inimical to the vitality\r\nof constitutionalism in China. The result was the forming of a\r\nconstitutional party in the Yangtze and southern provinces by Doctor\r\nSun Yat Sen and his friends, called the Tung Men Hwei (Sworn Brother\r\nSociety), some of whose measures were the supervision of Chinese\r\nfinances, and railway and industrial development, largely by Chinese,\r\nand the discharge of more regiments of northern troops. The National\r\nAssembly and cabinet have recently put in Sunyacius’ charge the\r\nformation of a central railway board to arrange for the extension of\r\nrailways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWIT AND HUMOR IN CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his book _Alone in China_, Julian Ralph, the New Yorker, wrote in\r\n1898 the following sentence:\r\n\r\n“The men and women of China will live in my mind forever, here and in\r\nheaven, as the jolliest, kindest, most sympathetic and generous souls I\r\never found in such profusion anywhere in my roving.”\r\n\r\nI have lived and traveled three years in China, and have found that\r\nthe Chinese influence the foreigners and that the foreigners influence\r\nthe Chinese, sharpening each other’s wit, and smoothing each other’s\r\nkindly humor. The jewel has many facets of view, depending on the angle\r\nof vision, and in the following I shall attempt to recall many of the\r\nangles.\r\n\r\nRegarding the foreign custom, written of by Kipling and others, of the\r\ntroubled or exiled ones of the treaty ports taking copiously to liquor\r\nfor consolation, a wit remarked: “A corkscrew will never pull a man out\r\nof sorrow.”\r\n\r\nThe Manchu soldiers read little, and have been under the impression\r\nthat others are like them. The “braves” on guard at the Ta Ping gate\r\nof Canton had been in the habit of extorting many a “cumshaw” from\r\nhumble-looking citizens before they were allowed to go on their\r\nbusiness. They caught a Tartar in 1910, when they seized a modern\r\neditor, who aired his complaint in his newspaper, which was read in\r\ndue time by the Military Prefect Lo. What occurred between Lo and his\r\nold-fashioned braves was not reported, but the braves for many months\r\nbefore the revolution of 1911 saw in every passer-by an editor. Up to\r\nthe time of free types, complaint had been smothered at the yamens.\r\n\r\nRevolutionary spies had gone ahead of new appointees to distant\r\nprovinces and impersonated them with a recitation of their record. In\r\nAugust, 1911, the Peking _Gazette_ recited that the cabinet would in\r\nfuture despatch a photograph in a sealed envelope to the governors, so\r\nthat “they could pick out the man who fitted the record by physiognomy\r\nas well as memory”.\r\n\r\nBack in the 80’s the famous Szechuen pioneer, Archibald Little, dunned\r\nthe ears of the Tsung Li Yamen (Foreign Board) at Peking for permission\r\nto open the whole Yangtze River from Shanghai to Chungking to steamer\r\nservice. “Yes,” said the humorously evasive board at last, “you may\r\nrun your steamer, but you know that a modern steamer will cut the\r\nunwieldy junks down. Therefore all sailing craft will tie up to the\r\nbank of the great river two days of each week, and give the terrible\r\nFung-kwei (foreign) steamer full reign on the Yangtze, but on those two\r\ndays of the week only. For five days of the week the steam craft must\r\nin reciprocation, tie up to the bank.” This would require weeks longer\r\nto ascend the river than could be done by tracking and sail, and Mr.\r\nLittle’s plan for fast steamer service was effectually disposed of by\r\nthe wily Manchu Board, which boasted that it “never denied a foreign\r\nrequest”.\r\n\r\nTwo trains of coolies meet, and words or a jostle precipitate a combat.\r\nAfter it is all over, and your men take up again the arms of your\r\nchair, you remark that although your leader’s clothes are nearly ripped\r\noff, he is laughing about it. In astonishment, you ask him why, and he\r\nreplies: “You should see the fellow I tackled; he hasn’t any left.”\r\n\r\nIn the country parts, if you hand a cigar to a man at an inn, he thinks\r\nit is proper manners to pass it to every one, to take a puff, just as\r\nhe would do with a pipe.\r\n\r\nThe _Chi Feng Pao_, a native paper of Peking, reported that in the\r\nmonth preceding the great 1911 revolution, even the house servants of\r\nthe Court had not received their wages for months, and that one morning\r\nthis anonymous placard was found placed on the comptroller’s door: “Not\r\neven a shadow of our pay to be seen yet. Why?”\r\n\r\nA Chinese merchant, who was disgusted that all his heirs died upon\r\nbirth, called at a life insurance office at Tientsin, and asked if\r\n“they could insure a well and proper birth”, for if so, he would gladly\r\ntake out a policy. He supposed that was what the new American life\r\ninsurance meant.\r\n\r\nA Hakka woman of the south was seldom given chicken by her husband,\r\nwho complained of the expense. She obtained his permission, however,\r\nto purchase a fowl for the god in the Taoist temple. The husband came\r\nhome, found his wife eagerly eating the bird, and shrieked out: “How is\r\nthis? I bought it for the god, not for you.” She replied: “I offered it\r\nto the god, who ate all he could of it. I am only eating the remainder,\r\nthanks to the god, and not to you, for that.”\r\n\r\nIt is the custom for the mandarins who go into a country inn, to hang\r\nout a red card, stating that “This inn is full”. A rejected guide\r\nreplied: “Rather the mandarin is full.”\r\n\r\nI have seen a humorous drawing on a screen, which shows a cat chasing\r\na mouse. The cat has only been able to catch a hind foot of the mouse,\r\nwhich keeps running, the foot lengthening in a most comical way,\r\njudging by the disgust on the face of the cat, and the laugh on the\r\nface of the mouse, which says: “That is all you get, anyway.”\r\n\r\n“How is it that there are no one-legged men to be seen in China; do\r\nyou have no accidents?” an intelligent official was asked, and he\r\nreplied humorously: “Oh, yes, but as we know nothing of surgery, when a\r\nman’s leg gets in trouble, we bury the whole man.”\r\n\r\nSome of their merry proverbs are:\r\n\r\n“If you must beat the priest, wait till he has ended the prayer for\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“It’s all very well to tell the priest that you are penitent, but prove\r\nit by pennies.”\r\n\r\n“A wheelbarrow ahead means a trail behind.”\r\n\r\n“Man’s mouth is wider than a volcano when it comes to words.”\r\n\r\nA sick man, sleeping fitfully, is said to be having a “raw sleep”, and\r\ncorrespondingly a tired or a drunken man, enjoying deep rest, is said\r\nto be having a “ripe sleep”.\r\n\r\nIt has been the custom of the French and Germans, when a missionary\r\nor an ambassador has been unfortunately assassinated, to compel the\r\nChinese government to erect a stone arch or pailoo, with the intent\r\nof warning the nation of the wrath of the foreigner. When you ask\r\nthe common people, who can not read, if the arch is “in memory of\r\nAmbassador So-and-So” they generally reply: “Oh, no, it’s to the other\r\nfellow. It’s in memory of patriot So-and-So who was executed by a\r\ncoerced government for killing a forward foreigner.”\r\n\r\nBeheading, outside of Kwangtung province, which has recently adopted\r\nmodern methods, is the punishment for far too many crimes. Scores\r\nof prisoners are often beheaded together, as they kneel in a row.\r\nThe Chinese loathe this method of punishment, as no good Confucian\r\ncan appear in the next world with a headless body to be worshiped\r\nas a god by his descendants. They overcome the difficulty by having\r\nthe head sewed on the body before it is buried. There is little to\r\nidentify the almost unclothed bodies, and the Doms or coolies who\r\nare hired to perform the gruesome task sometimes get the bodies and\r\nheads mixed up, delivering the right body but the wrong head to the\r\nsurprised though mourning family, which stands ready with the coffin\r\nand the identifiers. The Chinese are so possessed of humor that it is\r\nnot unknown for retainers to burst out laughing at the incongruous\r\nspectacle.\r\n\r\n“The American cost of living is nothing compared to the Chinese cost of\r\nloving,” said the demure mandarin, as he pointed to his five wives, et\r\ncetera!\r\n\r\nHere is a story that went the rounds of Peking, regarding the equipping\r\nof the First Division. A sum exactly sufficient had been allotted by\r\nthe Ping Pu (War Board). The first prince was too good a worshiper of\r\nhis ancestors to let such a sum of money pass through his hands without\r\ngiving the tablets their share, and he loved his women folk too much\r\nnot to give them a present, and then there was his own “cumshaw” or\r\ncommission, patriotism being a theory and “graft” a fact. The second\r\nprince would be quite lacking in the Li code of manners if he failed\r\nto copy the elder first prince, and so the money dwindled down the\r\nline, until the Ordnance Department was supplying wooden shells to\r\nfield guns and wooden cannon to ramparts. The First Division personnel\r\nwas on the list all right, but there was no money to uniform or arm\r\nthem. By and by a beggar was found in tatters by the wall. An orderly\r\nhurried up, shouted, “You’re the First Division, go and sew some of\r\nyour patches together, and defend Peking from the enemy; here’s your\r\nammunition.” He handed the beggar the last penny of the appropriation.\r\nThe beggar grasped the penny, ran off to the first cake stand, and\r\nas he swallowed the rice, exclaimed: “Hunger is the enemy, and I’m\r\ngoing to buy him off, for did not Confucius teach that diplomacy\r\nalways could defeat arms?” Such then was the famous equipping of the\r\nFirst Division. A traveled Manchu who heard this said: “How about your\r\nAmerican Manchus? We read your newspapers. Why don’t you foreigners\r\nmake jokes about the Quay ring of Philadelphia, and the Tammany ring\r\nof old New York, when you supplied your courts with everything but\r\njustice, even to triplicate bills for undiscoverable fixtures, and\r\nquadruplicate pay-rolls for undiscovered appointees? How about that\r\nstory of the lighting of the streets of your Darktown, each official\r\ntaking his perquisite, so that when the last penny reached the solitary\r\nlamplighter, that worthy concluded that it was so near morning that he\r\nwould go in a saloon opposite the unlit lamp, and drink up the money,\r\nletting nature furnish daylight to atone for the weaknesses of her\r\nchildren of the West?”\r\n\r\nHere is a story altered to suit any circuit in China. A stern mandarin\r\ngot the name of the “Old Devil”. One day, ahead of his escort, he\r\nreached his inn, where quarters had been engaged for him. On attempting\r\nto walk into the best room, the inn-keeper, who did not know him,\r\nstrenuously objected, explaining that the room was reserved for “the\r\nOld Devil himself”, and woe betide them all if the engagement was not\r\nrespected. When his escort came up, the mandarin had the inn-keeper\r\nflogged for daring to speak disrespectfully of a judge who was a\r\ndignified “father and mother” of the people, and at the same time\r\nhanded the man a handful of coins as a reward for keeping faith with\r\nthe said mandarin.\r\n\r\nThe coolies take some of their metaphors from their dirty inns. When a\r\nfellow acts impulsively they say: “A louse is loose in his thoughts” or\r\n“a flea has found his brain.”\r\n\r\nA conductor of a Chinese railway running out of Canton had his\r\ndifficulties both with the English language, and possibly with certain\r\nEnglish or American sailors on a holiday. He pasted up this notice in\r\nhis coach: “Small piecee bags onlee. Shaky head, shaky tongue, crazee\r\nmen, no can attain. Dirtee men must not smelee. Sick men more better\r\ndie, and go freight. Onlee Number One passenger can attain this car.”\r\n\r\nQuick transportation is not appreciated in every guild in China. In\r\nIchang the “loata” (captain) of a Yangtze gorge junk objected to the\r\nproposed railway to Wan Hsien. As an object lesson he was asked how\r\nlong it took him to take a cargo to Chungking, and he replied twenty\r\ndays. When he was told that a railway could deliver it in a day, he\r\nasked with a grimace, half between a sneer and a smile: “What would my\r\nmen and I do with the other nineteen days?”\r\n\r\nYunnan, the capital of the great southwest province, was the first\r\ncity of China, under the progressive Viceroy Li Chin Hsi, to erect\r\na sanitary modern prison, with workshops, commissary, etc. Yunnan,\r\nthough an extremely rich province in minerals, is so mountainous that\r\nthe people, who live on agriculture, are reduced to great poverty, and\r\nare in constant slavery to oppressive landlords who are really foray\r\nchiefs. Now that the comparatively palatial prison has been erected,\r\nthere is a rush to commit life-sentence crimes, so that the boarders\r\nmay be sure of a fine bed, good food, medical care, personal security,\r\nand interesting work in the various workshops for the rest of their\r\nhappy lives, as compared with the unbearable penury and danger of their\r\nlives among the hills. The Miaos, Lolos, Shans, and Chinese of Yunnan\r\nknow a good thing when they see it, and penology is a fad which is\r\nspreading like a fire among their mountain terraces at present.\r\n\r\nHere is a story of merry days at Peking. The legation ladies had\r\ninformed the Manchu princess that she must be modern since the Dowager\r\nEmpress Tse Hsi had decreed it; that she must learn English, music and\r\ndancing. As it was the trend of the hour, the suggestion was accepted.\r\nThe Manchu learned various things. It came to be her duty in time\r\nto receive a delegation of earnest missionary ladies, to whom she\r\nwas ready to prove that she was modern, and had received the foreign\r\nbranding. “I know modern American hymn; national anthem of great\r\nflowery flag country; hail to America. I will sing it and I will dance\r\nit.” She danced it and she sang it, and here is what the horrified\r\nmissionary ladies heard Madame Manchu Innocence thrill: _Waltz Me\r\nAround Again, Willie_.\r\n\r\n“With butter at fifty cents a pound and eggs at fifty cents a dozen\r\nin your honorable country, I should think you’d move the piano out,\r\nand move the cow and hens into your best room so as to be sure of the\r\nprecious creatures,” said a Chinese economist, who was reading the last\r\nAmerican paper at the Hankau guild, and who was satisfied with three\r\ncents a dozen for his eggs.\r\n\r\nThe tea-tasters employed are all foreigners, and it is essential that\r\nthe taster shall abstain from liquors and tobacco. When the first man\r\namong them is seen at the bar in a foreign club at Canton or Hankau, it\r\nis a surer sign than the calendar that July 1st is around again.\r\n\r\nMencius relates the story of a thief who, when apprehended, promised\r\nthat if he was not punished, he would gradually reduce his peculations\r\nuntil he reached the stage of honesty; that it was cruelty to stop him\r\nshort; that as he had been used to the privilege so long, he did not\r\nknow any other way in which to gain his livelihood. If Grover Cleveland\r\nwere living he might say that this Chinese was the first attorney for\r\nthe tariff, and its progeny.\r\n\r\nThe humorous pirate, who infests Kwangtung province waters near\r\nHongkong, seldom kills his victims now, as he has as effective a way of\r\nescape with the loot, while the helpless bark drifts at the mercy of\r\nthe waves to the wonder of the foreign navigator, who afar off spies\r\nits strange actions because of the unmanned rudder. Lately at Mui Shah,\r\na swift snake boat pulled up in the darkness alongside a slow-sailing\r\njunk, which was boarded. After robbing the crew, the pirates battened\r\nthem down beneath secured hatches, and made good their escape, smiling\r\nat their aptitude in carpentry.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that Chinese doctors are only rewarded for cures\r\nand for keeping their patients well. A physician was called in to\r\nsee a sick tax-collector (yamen runner). “You’ll have to call in\r\nanother doctor,” said the physician. “Am I so bad that you must have a\r\nconsultation?” inquired the alarmed patient. “No. You will remember,\r\nhowever, if you have as good a memory as I, that last week you searched\r\nhigh and low and taxed me the last cash on the limit of my property and\r\nmaximum income. I have too much conscience to kill you, but I’m honest\r\nenough to say that I want as little as possible to do with curing you,\r\nso good-by.”\r\n\r\nThere are more Chinese Macks and Mc’s in Canton and Hongkong than in\r\nall Argyleshire, Scotland. I recall a particularly droll character,\r\nMak, who was our godown-man at West Point, Hongkong. Mak (we never\r\ncalled him his personal name, which was Fun) was in full charge of\r\nthe warehouse, and came to the office twice a month with proper\r\naccounts, which always checked up with the yearly inventory. When, by\r\nappointment, I went down to supervise that inventory, all was as it\r\nshould be. Mak had a clean warehouse, in which neither rats nor coolies\r\nwere tenants, and his wharf was kept free of junks and sanpans. I\r\nreturned unexpectedly one day and found Mak collecting wharfage for\r\nhimself from junks which he had allowed to tie up at the wharf, and\r\nrent from coolie families whom he had allowed to camp, with possibly\r\ntheir plague Bacillariaceæ, between the aisles of gunny bales in the\r\ngodown. Longfellow speaks of “folding their tents like the Arabs and\r\nsilently stealing away,” but on this occasion, the retreat of the enemy\r\nwith their camp paraphernalia was accomplished with both confusion and\r\nnoise, because of the haste involved. “How is this, Mak?” I shouted\r\nas a stern typan should. “Oh, cousins overnight, you sabee; plenty\r\nbobbery, but Confucius says, shelter your kin,” Mak blandly replied.\r\nI made him assure me that they were all sailing for parts known or\r\nunknown on the morrow, but I knew that if I caught them there again,\r\nthey would be “other cousins” who had claimed hasty hospitality under\r\nthe same law and the same necessity. There was only one way to match\r\nthe blandness of Mak Fun, or any other godown-man, and that was to move\r\nin myself. As Mak was in other respects a good godown-man, I was blind\r\nin the port eye thereafter to this adaptation of the “cumshaw” by the\r\nclan of Chinese Macks, though as I passed, to quote from the same verse\r\nof Longfellow’s poem, “the night was filled with music” in Chinese\r\nMak’s direction.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese accept the saddest thing in the world in a droll cheerful\r\nmanner. A son, who had grown prosperous in Hongkong, sent his father,\r\nwho lived in the silk district outside of Canton, a splendid lacquered\r\ncoffin, which he was to keep before him in the best room for friends to\r\nsee. The son’s letter said: “Here is something gorgeous for The Event”\r\n(that is, his father’s death).\r\n\r\nThe North China _Herald_ gives the following as a sample of a Chinese\r\nboy’s request upon his employer for a recommendation, after he had been\r\ndischarged by the officious butler: “Before I have leaved here the\r\nservices, was troubled by here butler. He squeezes (steals), lies, and\r\nmakes private of anythings, and also he said wrong of my bad conducts\r\nas a rascal. He discharged me for his brother in secret. After that you\r\nlost things which are determined in my brain. Now I beg you to request\r\nof Missy (the employer’s wife) which as possible as you can. But I am\r\nunliking at there Master to do anythings, I am much obliged to come\r\nto my new place under of your charges (recommendation) and beg you to\r\nbless me as boy or coolie business for my content at all, or please\r\nyou to commence the any other places you know of. So I hope you to\r\ngrant me a good report, for I am beg it to you on knees. Shall be much\r\nobediently and obliged. Address me to here as ‘No. 2 boy’. I remain,\r\nSir, That obedient coolie servant, etc.”\r\n\r\nFor centuries there has been an amusing burglary insurance system and\r\na droll code of courtesy between watchmen and robbers in China. If you\r\ndo not wish to run the risk of being robbed, you pay the Head Thief,\r\nor Chief of the Robber Beggars, a fee, and he protects and insures you\r\nfrom loss and annoyance. Your watchman pounds his drum to show you that\r\nhe is earning his salary, and at the same time to let the thief know\r\nwhere the watchman is, so that he may operate in safety if the owner\r\nhas not taken out the usual insurance.\r\n\r\nA coolie urged his cousin “for ten thousand reasons” not to go into the\r\nforeigner’s church, where the powerful orator was “sending people who\r\nstole to hell.” He was fully convinced that if no one spoke over him\r\nthe dreadful words of objurgation, he could steal and run no chance of\r\ngoing to the inferior regions. _In ignorantia salus!_\r\n\r\nOn the subject of compressed feet, here is the Oriental side: “It’s\r\nfear, not modesty, that denies you white men more than one wife,” said\r\nthe Chinese joker. “You equip your women with first-class feet, and\r\nthey are as strong and swift as your men. What would one lone man do in\r\na retreat before many claimants?”\r\n\r\nThere is a law prohibiting fortune-tellers soliciting on the streets.\r\nThe Hongkong _Telegraph_ writes that a fakir is standing at a hotel\r\ndoor, desiring to peer into the future of the passers-by. The paper,\r\nwith its usual wit, suggests that an officer of the law should peer\r\ninto the fakir’s immediate future!\r\n\r\nThe same paper coins this aphorism: “We never know how many friends we\r\nhave till we don’t need them; or how few friends we have till we need\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nA motor truck was rushing by with a load of empty barrels. “Nothing can\r\nstop them,” suggested the admiring Chan. “Nothing but corks,” replied\r\nthe punnist Choi.\r\n\r\nThe Oriental has seized on Billiken, with the exaggerated mosquito-bite\r\non his bald head, his elongated cranium, his wolf’s ears, comedian’s\r\nsmile like DeWolf Hopper’s or Coquelin’s, his elephant’s feet, Buddha’s\r\nbarrel-stomach, and monkey’s arms, as the god of western wealth, humor,\r\nor what-not. The idiot idol, warming his enormous feet, is installed\r\nbefore many a footlight of burning tapers and punk-sticks in the\r\nshrines of eclecticism in both Taoist and Buddhist China.\r\n\r\nTo show that hygiene is not fully understood yet in China, which is\r\nso anxious to learn, they tell this story. A European passenger in a\r\ncoast-wise steamship, who had to share his room with an Oriental who\r\nhad been modernized too quickly, found the latter using his tooth-brush\r\nin the morning ablutions. “You blankety son of the sun, that’s MY\r\ntooth-brush,” exclaimed the disgusted Occidental. “Me bow low for\r\npardons; me thought it was ship’s tooth-brush,” apologized the Oriental.\r\n\r\nThe witty Hongkong _Mail_ (was the veteran Murray Bain or the scholarly\r\nReed the author?) explained to the fellow into whose nog glass an\r\nancient egg was deposited by the Chinese boy that it wasn’t the fault\r\nof the Cathayan hen, but the fault of the administrators of her estate.\r\n\r\nA visitor chided a Hongkong volunteer with the sounds of revelry which\r\nproceeded from one quarter of the camp, and a wit connected with the\r\nlocal _Press_ shot out this repartee: “Oh, I know Ancient and Honorable\r\nMilitary Companies where you come from, whose strategy is greatest on\r\nthe canteen, whose night attacks are mostly on the bottle, and whose\r\nfield-glass is a wine glass.”\r\n\r\nThe Happy Valley Cemetery trustees at Hongkong were arguing over the\r\nprices of graves. One wit defended the resolution before the board by\r\nsaying: “A man only dies once in the East, and surely can afford the\r\nluxury of a high-priced grave.”\r\n\r\nThe astrologer complained of thieves robbing his house. “You’re an\r\ninfallible astrologer, aren’t you?” inquired the judge. “Yes, indeed,”\r\nreplied the soothsayer. “Well, why didn’t you foretell the advent of\r\nthe thieves?” remarked the droll mandarin. Tableau!\r\n\r\nSaid the ignorant but successful man of enormous paunch to the caustic\r\nwit: “I have no use for a man whose head is so big that he has to\r\nscratch his hair away out here.” “Nor I,” said the wit, “for the\r\nlittle-brained hog who has to button his vest away out here.”\r\n\r\nThe Chinese poor sleep in the open--the Great Unroofed--generally on\r\ntheir backs against a pillar or wall, with their knees drawn up. A new\r\nmission hospital gathered in the sick, the lame and the blind, who\r\nwere sweetly tucked in soft clean beds, under sheets, and commended to\r\ntheir lullabies. In the morning the staff came upon an amusing sight.\r\nEvery patient had dropped out of bed, and was sleeping in the tried\r\nand true, good old fashion against the bed post on the floor. All they\r\nwould say was: “Me no sabee new fashion.”\r\n\r\nThe patient missionary at last reminded John that it was all right to\r\neat rice “on him” and get hospital treatment, but that there was a\r\nlittle card which he had signed promising to be a regular contributor\r\nas well as a benefiting member of the organization. John wrote: “My\r\nvenerable Rev.: Blushed am I to have been reminded of my forget in\r\nworshipping and offering. Here I enclose my apology and the sum you\r\nlike if I am right in making out your multiply. Your spoiled lamb.”\r\n\r\nMany nations have been credited with this witty repartee, and the\r\nChinese are included in the list. The Hongkong merchant prince was\r\nshowing his mountain palace, his tennis courts, his stable, his\r\nautomobile, possibly his flying machine, his billiard table, his\r\nbowling alley, etc., to the Solon from Canton. “You see that when we\r\nBritish devote ourselves to pleasure, we do it regardless of expense.”\r\n“Rather,” replied the Chinese, whose relaxation was of a gentler kind,\r\nsuch as walking in gardens, and flying birds and kites, “I should say\r\nyou devote yourself to expense regardless of pleasure.”\r\n\r\nSolomon came to humorous judgment when two women of First Kings brought\r\ntheir case before him, and Lord Kitchener is credited with a grim humor\r\nin dealing with the Arab sheiks who wanted to enlist in the war against\r\nItaly. Here is Chinese humor of the same sort. All of the mandarin’s\r\nstaff at his new station thought they would embarrass him by applying\r\nfor promotions. Granted with gusto! Every one’s position was advanced\r\none grade, but the salaries were all reduced one grade at the same time\r\nowing to retrenchments needed.\r\n\r\nA freshman of Queen’s College, writing of the popularity of Sir Matthew\r\nNathan, the indefatigable British governor of Hongkong, who died\r\nfrom exposure in the 1900 typhoon, said: “He is a very common man.”\r\nHe, however, meant common in the Scriptural sense that the heroic\r\ngovernor’s fame was common to all.\r\n\r\nChinese women are short and soft as compared with the larger and\r\nstronger foreign women seen in the treaty ports. A Chinese student\r\nsatirist, who had served as a house boy in San Francisco, thus\r\ndescribed in an essay his former American mistress and her daughters:\r\n“The Americaness is open air breather, consequently her meat is\r\nharder than Chinese (he meant her muscle). In a dangerous melancholy\r\nacting, the young Americaness quickly traps her sorrow husband who\r\ncomes to pity, but soon runs to grieve in divorce when loving voice\r\nof Americaness recovers from coyness. Bud of romance early frosted\r\nmakes scandal column of paper, which is best advertising much sought\r\nand read like dog in manger by all actress without job. Cold ethics of\r\nChinese woman in comparison sprouts not too quick ruin, consequently\r\nwears better. Americaness system much exciting is open-air theater for\r\nall to laugh and read as run. Americaness never reaches next birthday,\r\nconsequently always fresh and sweet like comquat in syrup; but American\r\npoet says: ‘Beware, some sweets do cloy, but food is good each day.’ I\r\nthink then China wife is like food, if plain, always satisfying, and\r\nfills the bill, as American Zoo keepers say. American man and Chinese\r\nman believe womans should go slow; consequently Americaness wear\r\nhobble skirt like lasso on ankle, and Chinese woman bind foot. Both\r\nmens take no chances, and exchange mutual wink. However, Chinese woman\r\nand Americaness woman, is both queenesses of talk--when once begun then\r\nheroes run. Talk then is kingdom of womens called Suffragetia, where\r\nmans sees finish and casts his weapons in humble dust.”\r\n\r\nDescribing life among his friends, the bell-boys at the Shanghai hotels\r\nwho have frequently to answer calls for a B. & S. after a bath, another\r\nwit said: “The guests are ringing (wringing) wet in two spellings.”\r\n\r\nWas this Oriental a flatterer of womankind, or a droll cynic regarding\r\nmankind? The wife of the missionary asked the native pupil to translate\r\nour maxim: “Out of sight, out of mind,” and he rendered it into these\r\ncharacters: “Your husband is insane when he is away from you.” Another\r\nboy wrote it: “The angels are crazy.”\r\n\r\nAt the Chinese Club a scholarly Chinese traveler warned me to follow\r\nthe Royal Hongkong Golf Club’s motto, “Festina lente” (make haste\r\nslowly), in dwelling upon the wonderful traits of the Chinese, and he\r\nrelated the following humorous story: “In your country an enthusiastic\r\nmissionary, daringly stimulated by the applause of his audience, put\r\nwonder upon wonder, Pelion on Ossa piled, in describing the vicarious\r\nvirtues of the Chinese, by saying: ‘Yes, dear children, lives are cheap\r\nin China. I knew a man there who made his living by selling himself to\r\nthe executioners to take the place of those condemned to death.’”\r\n\r\nHere is a tale of facetiousness and evasion. A wag, whose appearance\r\nwas against him, called at a prison, and held this dialogue with the\r\nclerk: “Is the mandarin in?” “No.” “Is the deputy in?” “No.” “Is the\r\njailer in?” “No.” “Is the bamboo-wielder in?” “No.” “Oh, say, are the\r\nprisoners in, Mr. No-No-No?”\r\n\r\nOne of the modernized officials labeled his friend’s book of personal\r\npress flatteries, “The Pursuit of Egotism.”\r\n\r\nThe well-known Bankers’ Association of Tokio is called the “Eel\r\nSociety”. I asked my Chinese friend for his interpretation of this, and\r\nhe explained: “Because they are as slippery in the grasp of their Diet\r\nas is your Money Trust in the hands of Congress.” He further told me\r\nthat they call the administration papers which say that “everything is\r\nlovely and the goose hangs high”, “official frogs”, because they only\r\nknow one note, and one sets the others going on the same old thing.\r\n\r\nTwo wags met on the street of the Shansi Bankers’ Guild, Peking. One\r\nwore a sour and the other a comical expression. The cynic clenched\r\nhis fist at the teak-barred windows of one bank, and with a wry face\r\nexclaimed, “I don’t know how he’s giving it away, but I do know how he\r\ngot it.” The other, holding out the hush-money of a silver sycee bar,\r\nand pointing to a banker’s residence across the road, answered: “I\r\ndon’t know how he got it, but I happen to know how he’s giving it away.”\r\n\r\nA popular Chinese restaurant bears the legend of “The Quiet Woman”, and\r\nthe caricature shows a standing woman, whose decapitated head lies at\r\nher feet, and wears at last, before her triumphant husband, a defeated\r\nexpression. The double humor is that henpecked men may safely come to\r\nthis restaurant, and enjoy that quiet and retirement which home does\r\nnot afford.\r\n\r\nThe humorist tells of a stutterer who held up an old friend, and\r\nclinging to his pajama-frog (for pajamas are outside and not inside\r\nclothes in old-style China), said: “If-f-f-f-f y-y-you h-have an hour\r\nI’d l-l-like to h-have a m-m-minute’s c-conversation with you.”\r\n\r\nAthletics of all sorts, except Rugby football, are popular at China’s\r\nbest technical school, Pei Yang University at Tientsin. English is used\r\nfor all lectures except, of course, Chinese classics. The subject of\r\nestablishing a debating class or a Rugby football team came up, and a\r\nprofessor who defended the former said that “he preferred a man who\r\ncould stand on his feet and make his head work to one who could stand\r\non his head and make his feet work”.\r\n\r\nA rich brute went to meet his victim whom he had impoverished. He\r\njeered, so as to break his spirit as he had done to his estate: “My!\r\nwhat a come down; what poor clothes.” Quick as a flash from the\r\nnever-say-die man came the repartee: “Yes, I expected to meet you, but\r\nyou should see me on ordinary days.”\r\n\r\nThe practical joker has visited romantic Macao. They tell this story\r\nof the Portuguese Sé Mission Cathedral. The Macao women are short, and\r\nthe fonts of holy water are placed too high on the wall for them to\r\nlook into. The devil was put into the sacred waters by the bad boy, the\r\ndevil this time being crabs, which unseen, nipped the fingers of the\r\nsuperstitious women as they searched high up for the soothing blessing.\r\n\r\nThe naming of the Chinese servants on board ship, in mess, hong, office\r\nor godown, has presented many a difficulty, and the civilian is more\r\ninconsiderately humorous than the missionary, especially when his help\r\nchanges often, as is the case in Hongkong. Numbers instead of names\r\nare generally used. “Number Two piecee cook” is what you would say if\r\nyou desired the second cook called. “Number One piecee topside boy” is\r\nwhat your wife would say if she desired the first up-stairs chamber\r\nboy called. There are no chambermaids. Where a woman is employed, she\r\nserves only as an amah; that is, mother-nurse, or mother-maid. In the\r\nirreverent messes and barracks, some of the men name their servants\r\nafter some personal distinction or appearance, such as “The Tall One”;\r\n“One Eye”; “Melica”, because he told you that he had once sailed on a\r\nship for America; “Jesus man”, because he told you he got converted at\r\na mission school and preferred the name; “Governor boy”, because he was\r\nonce a servant in the governor’s yamen. Sometimes the messes christen\r\ntheir servants according to their favorite political leaders in America\r\nor England: “Loosy Velly” is, of course, Roosevelt; “Blyan” is Bryan;\r\n“Wheel Sun” is Wilson; “Salls Belly” is Salisbury; “Loy Jo” is Lloyd\r\nGeorge, and one boy rejoiced in the name of “Jimmy de Blaney” (Blaine).\r\nHundreds of these silent servants are moving about the dining-room\r\nof the palatial Hongkong Club at tiffin (lunch) time, yet you will\r\nnot hear a footfall, as they wear felt-soled shoes. Perhaps they are\r\nas silently giving you and me numbers, instead of names, in Chinese.\r\nIndeed, I know they do, and would be ashamed to tell my tourist\r\nfriends that some of them are soon known as “Wigglety Walk”; “Always\r\nShout”; “Fool Laugh”; “Pig Eye”; “Wine Face”; “Wine Whiskers” (red\r\nbeard); “Buddha’s Belly” (stout); and when women attract them, “Tea\r\nFlower” (pale one); “Buddha’s Mother” (a sweet matron); “Flowery Flag”\r\n(American); “British Queen”; “Snow Flower” (Canadian), etc.\r\n\r\nKipling, Archibald Little, Price Collier and others have written\r\nthat some men sometimes drink hard east of Suez. The writer himself\r\nin a former book related the bravery of a famous 11 A. M. Cocktail\r\nBrotherhood in the blazing stifling Orient, and two world-known knights\r\nof the pen took him to tournament to break a lance because of it.\r\nOne witty evening an old hand on the club veranda admitted the soft\r\nimpeachment, and gave himself and some others medals for the dangers he\r\nhad passed in these words of Cicero in the immortal “Murena” oration:\r\n“If Asia does carry with it a suspicion of luxury, surely it is a\r\npraise-worthy thing, not never to have seen Asia, but to have lived\r\ntemperately in Asia.” Ah! we who had weathered many a storm, sighed,\r\nand in bravery ordered one more, drinking not to the habit, but to the\r\nwit. As Archibald Little, veteran of the East, said, the tea-tasting\r\nseason was over, and a mile-stone should be set to mark it!\r\n\r\nA droll Chinese boy brought his fast running watch to Gaupp’s jewelry\r\nstore on Queen’s Road, Hongkong. On being asked to explain as best he\r\ncould what seemed to be the trouble, the Celestial rolled up those\r\nexpressive eyes of his, which must move the gods, as they always do\r\nmen, to laughter: “Oh, he too muchee to-mollow (to-morrow); you jerk\r\nback to to-day.”\r\n\r\n“We have come here to stay,” boasted a corps of the enemy, which took\r\nup an advanced position. “Yes, they stayed,” replied doughty General Li\r\nYuen after the battle, and his grim smile explained that they stayed as\r\ndead bodies.\r\n\r\nYen Tsz, an eminent premier of the Tsi principality, and a contemporary\r\nwit with Confucius, referring to the increase of crime which called for\r\nthe punishment of the amputation of feet, used this ironical phrase:\r\n“False feet are cheaper than shoes these days in our market-place.”\r\n\r\nThe humor of war is grim. Shortly before Confucius’ day the prince of\r\nTsu State had overcome the army of Tsin State. The dead lay in heaps.\r\nThe Tsu prince was asked if he would not order a tablet raised over\r\nthe brave enemy. “Not much,” said he, “I will have a tablet to my own\r\nancestors raised over them, giving thanks that we do the crowing\r\ninstead of them this time.”\r\n\r\nA fireman on the new Canton-Hankau railway made out his report of a\r\nregrettable fatality in a collision as follows: “The engineer was died\r\nwithout senses.”\r\n\r\nA consolidation of three formerly independent samshu liquor dealers of\r\nCanton advertised as follows: “This three rice bier dealers, before\r\nseparate, is now amalgamated for quite economic, and glad with much\r\npublic order for oblige soled more cheap to foreign friends.”\r\n\r\nOn a landing in a curio store, popular with foreigners, was the\r\nfollowing sign: “Peoples alighted here go down stairs if curious\r\nwishing.”\r\n\r\nA penitent convert wrote his mission school teacher as follows: “Many\r\nthoughts of unpleasant come into my mind. Many tears drop my spiritual\r\nsoul not to speak of outside eyes. I break my beautiful promise. I\r\ncontemps the difficults but was mistake. I was failed that time to\r\nfinish the very good of God which begunned. Deep repents of my throat\r\nis blocked thickly in bearing regrets for everlasting, but I standing\r\nfor your forgive and excuse of God like poor Peter in three times with\r\nhandkerchief on shame face and water eyes.”\r\n\r\nJust as humorously confused is the attempt of nine-tenths of the\r\nforeigners to make themselves understood in Chinese. Sometimes the\r\nefforts of our missionaries and translators reach the old book-shops,\r\nand are promptly thrown with a smile, which is more humorous than\r\ncynical in these days of humor and enlightenment, into the compartment\r\nentitled: “Second Hand Religion.”\r\n\r\nI asked my Chinese friend why their ideograph for two friends was two\r\npearls, and he explained: “Because each is equally precious, without\r\nthe possibility or necessity of being exactly alike.” Let this answer\r\nfor a picture of America and China as the new days dawn on each side\r\nof the Pacific. A Tientsin shop seems to have grasped satisfactorily\r\nthe situation, its sign reading: “All languages spoken: American\r\nunderstood.”\r\n\r\nThe many thousand ideograms of the Chinese language are memorized, and\r\nwords are often tabulated for the pupil by rhyme. They have no alphabet\r\nand therefore can never use a linotype or typewriter. The Chinese,\r\naccordingly, have wonderful memories, but their memory-method sometimes\r\nplaces them in humorous situations. English is now required in nearly\r\nall the new Chinese schools, though the Chinese mandarin examiners\r\nknow little about the language as yet. A confident Chinese candidate\r\nappeared before the board of a Kwangtung province school as an\r\napplicant for the position of “Professor of English”. “How much English\r\ndo you know?” profoundly inquired the mandarin from behind his heavy,\r\ntortoise-rimmed glasses. The amusing reply was: “Numbers, one to ten;\r\na hundred words beginning with ‘A’, and ten words rhyming with sing.”\r\nThe Chinese board accepted the Chinese teacher of English for want\r\nof a better man. The new Chinese are eminently a business race, and\r\ntherefore, in their excellent business judgment, the day will come when\r\nthey will be compelled to throw away their ideographs so as to avail of\r\nthe business facilities of our alphabet-typewriter and linotype. The\r\npresent Chinese ideograph case in a printing office has thousands of\r\nideograph types, and it is a sadly humorous sight on a hot day in humid\r\nSouth China to see a Chinese typesetter darting about the room like a\r\ndragon-fly, trying to meet the editor’s demand for an “extra.”\r\n\r\nThe carriages of a funeral procession rolled along the maloo of\r\nmodernized Shanghai. The mourners in the first carriage played cards\r\nand laughed. Every one else in the procession joked and smiled. I\r\nasked my Chinese humorist to explain the astonishing incongruity and\r\nhe replied: “Why shouldn’t everybody be happy when everybody is deeply\r\nsatisfied? Hop Long’s enemies believe that he has descended below to\r\nget at last the many punishments that are coming to him, and Hop Long’s\r\nfriends just as confidently believe that he has ascended on high to\r\nreceive his richly merited rewards; therefore, you see, all are joyful.”\r\n\r\nThe landlord made an agreement with the tenant that when the rice was\r\nharvested, he should receive one-third. Harvest was long past in its\r\npale and sickle moon, and the landlord, receiving nothing, accosted\r\nthe tenant: “Look here, thou Choi, didn’t we make an agreement that I\r\nshould receive one-third of that rice?” Choi, nothing daunted, replied:\r\n“Yes, Laoye, but there was no third; there were only two baskets of\r\nrice and they are both mine.”\r\n\r\nTwo Chinese youths were discussing their ambitions. One said: “When I\r\ngrow up I want to belong to a theatrical company.” His brother replied:\r\n“Humph, not I. I want the theatrical company to belong to me.”\r\n\r\nThe Chinese do not raise milch cows or goats. The following aged milk\r\njoke accordingly has been trotted out before every mess table of Treaty\r\nPort China, and been made to blush as a novice for the entertainment\r\nof every griffin. It seems that the new China hands insisted on having\r\nfresh milk in their tea. For the sake of peace the Number One boy at\r\nlast procured it. The new hands said: “Of course it’s not like the June\r\ngrass milk at home, but it will do in a pinch.” The Number One boy\r\nsmiled blandly. At last the milk ceased and the new hands demanded an\r\nexplanation, which the Number One boy gave as follows: “No molo milkee;\r\nthat piecee olo pig have now got litter of lil pigs; that piecee bucket\r\nwhitewash now makee finish.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL CHINA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eastern states of America and Great Britain have a new slogan:\r\n“Get ready for the Panama Canal.” The western states of America,\r\nand indeed all America, should have another slogan: “Get ready for\r\nthe China trade.” It is not far off; it is already on the horizon,\r\n“arising a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand”. It may\r\ncome with a rush any year and thousands of companies will have their\r\nheadquarters at New York. There are many things to arrange, internally\r\nand externally, in currency, in a tariff of twelve per cent. instead\r\nof five per cent., in provincial, inter-provincial and international\r\npolitics, in loans and finances, in education, in nationalization\r\nof trunk railways, in harbor, canal and river conservancy, in\r\nreforestation, in patent, copyright and mining laws, in commercial\r\nlaw, in army matters, in a revenue navy, in police, in municipal\r\norganization, in hygiene, in paternalization as far as famine, flood\r\nand seed grain are concerned, in collection of taxes, in civil service,\r\netc., but none of these difficulties is insuperable. Then comes the\r\ngreat trade.\r\n\r\nOn my travels and life of three years in China, I have listened, and I\r\nhave glanced about for signs of the new times; and I shall relate just\r\na few of the indications of progress, indications as different from\r\nthe old manifestations as day is from night. Three years ago, yes, one\r\nyear ago, few thought that these things were possible. Twenty recent\r\nbooks and five thousand newspaper articles prophesied that they were\r\nnot possible. Thirty recent authors and ten thousand newspaper writers\r\nwere Laodicean in attitude. Alas, ye Manchuized scribes! A few books, a\r\nfew articles, many missionaries, and the October, 1911, revolution said\r\nthey were possible, and the fall of Nanking proved it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright, 1913, The Bobbs-Merrill Company.\r\n\r\n  Industrial China.

A modern road skirts the\r\n    cliffs.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAgricultural machinery will before long be required on the great plains\r\nof Pechili, Mongolia and the three Manchurian provinces, whence America\r\nwill draw much grain, meat, oil, lumber and coal. Nail, needle and\r\nglass factories are going up on a small scale. China has the iron in\r\nthe mine, but she will need our machinery. Paper mills are largely\r\nincreasing, and we need their pulp. Some mills use bamboo, which the\r\nJapanese successfully experimented on in Formosa. Factories for making\r\nsoap, the most glaringly deficient thing in dirty China hitherto, have\r\nbeen erected, even in far western Chingtu City. China, like Japan, has\r\nconcluded to adopt wool in the northern provinces instead of padded\r\ncotton and sheepskin. Woolen mills have been erected at Shanghai,\r\nPeking, Lanchow, Hankau, Kalgan, etc., to work up to the vast supplies\r\nof Mongolian and Pechili shearings. The old method of making winter\r\nclothing was to pad cotton and silk with cotton batting and silk waste,\r\nthe wearer being transformed into a comical Falstaffian size. Modern\r\ntanneries have been erected by Mohammedan Chinese at Hankau, Lanchow,\r\nSingan, etc. Hardware and enameled ware factories have been erected at\r\nTientsin, Canton, etc., but China can not for years take care of her\r\nneeds in hardware. Flour mills abound at Harbin, Shanghai and Hongkong,\r\nand will be rapidly extended throughout the north. Cement is being\r\nheavily produced, and will increase, great factories now being run\r\nat Tongshan in Pechili, Canton and Macao in Kwangtung, and Tayeh in\r\nHupeh provinces. All of these industries will need machinery. Of all\r\nmunicipal improvements, China has needed modern water-works the most.\r\nThey are now in operation in the cities of Shanghai, Hankau, Tientsin,\r\nCanton, Peking, Mukden, Chingtu, Nanking, Hangchow, Chinkiang, Swatow,\r\nTsinan, Newchwang, etc. Electric cars are run at Canton, Shanghai,\r\nPeking, Hongkong, Hankau, Tientsin, Tsingtau, etc. Hongkong has a\r\nwonderful cable railway up 1,500 feet of mountain, which will be\r\ncopied at Kiukiang, and other hill resorts from the heat. Telephone\r\nservice is installed at Hongkong, Canton, Shanghai, Peking, Tientsin,\r\nTsingtau, Chingtu, Wuhu, Hangchow, Ningpo, Nanking, etc. Electric\r\nlight is furnished at Nanking, Peking, Tientsin, Tsingtau, Hankau,\r\nSwatow, Mukden, Newchwang, Shanghai, Hangchow, etc. In little of this\r\nhave the Americans entered as yet, though they will on a vast scale\r\nas American finance and industry extends its agencies. The financing\r\nand the contracting often go together, and it is not unknown for the\r\nBritish and Germans to combine, though the British would be glad to\r\njoin with the Americans, if there were Americans on the ground. Often\r\nthe suppliers divide on a plant, the British furnishing the engines\r\nand boilers, and the Germans the dynamos. Gas works are also being\r\nerected, and the incandescent mantle lamps are very popular. As China\r\nhas untold riches in coal, her development in gas lighting will be\r\nextensive. There is a great field for American machinery here. Her pipe\r\nfoundries will grow, as she has as much iron as coal. For many years,\r\nhowever, her industrial, municipal and railway supplies, and certainly\r\nher machinery, must largely come from abroad. It is a great field\r\nfor the manufacturing nations, and even Austria is entering it with\r\nrecent success. She has increased the service of the Austrian Lloyd\r\nSteamship Company from Trieste, and her manufactures are seen more and\r\nmore throughout the Far East. Yet Austria is not a nation that can be\r\ncompared with America, Britain or Germany in potentiality.\r\n\r\nSince China has become a purchaser of machinery, she invites the world\r\nto advertise in Chinese in her newspapers, and to open agencies in\r\nChina, where Chinese is read by the compradores at least. She hates\r\nconcession hunters when they are of the Pizarro and Cortez type, and\r\ndesires to exploit and profit by her own wealth. I have seen the\r\nbitterest complaint in the _Ching Wei Pao_, an able native paper of\r\nTientsin, that too many franchises are given free to foreigners, who\r\npay small wages and take the profits out of the country. Can you blame\r\nthem for desiring municipal ownership, if they are willing to buy our\r\nmachinery and hire our instructors?\r\n\r\nChina is slowly establishing fire departments in its municipal and\r\nmarine life. I have seen a fire break out on oil boats in the West\r\nRiver of Kwangtung province. Gongs were struck everywhere, and tugs\r\nand launches hastened to the scene and with hose poured water upon the\r\nblaze.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese engine builders of Hongkong, who were apprenticed at the\r\nBritish Hongkong and Whampoa Dock Company, are successfully copying\r\nforeign marine engines and pumps, and for boats under one thousand\r\ntons European builders can not compete with them, except in the matter\r\nof quicker delivery, which is often important. Many motor-boats,\r\nmanufactured in Hongkong, are brought across the Pacific for delivery\r\nin Canada via the C. P. R. steamships. Until recently the Szechuen and\r\nHupeh boatmen of the upper Yangtze would not permit the competition of\r\nsteam, but the Kwangtung province men of the West River--the brainiest\r\nmen of modern China--have been quick to adopt machinery, possibly\r\nbecause wonderful Hongkong was so near as an example of the new era and\r\nan efficient interpreter of the West to the East. While the labor at\r\nHongkong is Chinese, most of the capital and the expert foremanship is\r\nBritish.\r\n\r\nThe total taxes that a Chinese pays for national, provincial and\r\nmunicipal purposes is one dollar per head per year, against seven\r\ndollars in Russia, and twenty dollars in Europe and America. As most of\r\nthis money is wasted on soon obsolete navies and armies, and is drawn\r\nfrom mines and land that can not be replenished, one can see the vast\r\nwealth with which China will some day suddenly step into the world\r\narena, China strong, and the others impoverished in all but brain power.\r\n\r\nIn Kiangsu and Chekiang provinces, very simple methods are followed in\r\nproducing cotton-seed oil. The seeds are heated, packed into a barrel\r\nand pressure is exerted by driving wedges under a hoop. Meal is made in\r\nbuffalo-driven stone mills. These methods will soon change with modern\r\nindustrial organization and the importation of our machinery.\r\n\r\nAt Kiating in the south of Szechuen province are the remarkable gas and\r\nsalt wells, the former supplying fuel to evaporate the brine of the\r\nlatter. The industry is immense, there being many thousands of wells in\r\nthe opulent Min River valley of Central China. The salt is a government\r\nmonopoly, and may be retained as such in the new financing, as in some\r\nfeatures of national revenue French and Japanese methods, instead\r\nof American and British, may be followed. In that case, the federal\r\ngovernment would be the purchaser of the new machinery.\r\n\r\nOnly north of the Yangtze River are ponies seen. Szechuen province\r\nhas the most beautiful, many of them being black. The Mongolian pony\r\nof the provinces farther north has a heavier body and a worse temper.\r\nJapan has commenced the stocking of horses, and China will do likewise,\r\nwhen she widens her roads, and increases the size of her farms so as\r\nto make an animal useful, the men displaced from employment going to\r\nthe new mines and railways. Moreover, China is at her wits’ end for\r\nfertilizer, which stock will furnish. She has been at her wits’ end\r\nfor fuel and has been burning the field stubble and straw needed for\r\ncompost. Now coal will save for her this land enricher.\r\n\r\nThe fine guild houses in the various cities are erected by subscription\r\nand are put in charge of a caretaker. Meeting halls, showrooms,\r\nrestaurants, theater and sleeping quarters are provided. It is the\r\nsame as if the Ohio men put up a guild house in New York, and the New\r\nYork men put up a guild house in Cincinnati; or if Edinburgh traders\r\nerected a guild house in London, and London men reciprocated. It\r\nwas the reciprocal working of these guilds which showed the Chinese\r\nthat assemblies and parliaments were feasible, and next to the\r\nforeign-trained students, the guild men have been foremost in China’s\r\nrepresentative political bodies. Here are some of the practical\r\nproverbs that are hung up in the guild rooms:\r\n\r\n“He who keeps everlastingly at it will grow legs long enough to jump\r\nthe highest mountain.”\r\n\r\n“When there’s fire a distant lake is not so good as a near bucketful.”\r\n\r\n“Gambling is not good, but still I have known one who risked his last\r\npenny and got his first pound.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t need to thrash a fast horse, or yell at a wise man.”\r\n\r\n“Trust an orange-seller to say that his oranges are sweet, and a\r\nshoemaker to say that his shoes don’t leak.”\r\n\r\n“A smiling salesman enhances his wares.”\r\n\r\n“A little attention to the cutting end of a chisel makes necessary only\r\na little attention to the striking end.”\r\n\r\nThe inland Chinese are sometimes clever in working themselves into the\r\nforeigner’s personnel of staff. First the father brings his boy, and\r\nthe boy brings his cousin, imploring the foreigner to let them wait\r\naround the office to pick up a little English. They insist on doing\r\nor pretending to do chores; they whisper to the staff to halve their\r\nwork with them, and then they beg for or demand a wage “while they are\r\nlearning English.” Seldom does the kind-hearted foreigner refuse it,\r\nand he is really spreading the commercial and literary gospel of the\r\nWest by doing so.\r\n\r\nIn some of the Yangtze provinces designs are even yet stamped into the\r\ndyed cotton and silk, by stencil with lime, which takes out the color,\r\nas compared with our system of rolling the inked design on plain goods.\r\nThe old will be rung out by the new, as Tennyson prophesied.\r\n\r\nMan as a beast of burden must depart in patient earnest China, which\r\nis associated with such unique sights of physical slavery as dozens\r\nof coolies harnessed to a wagon-load of teak in Hongkong, or several\r\nhundred trackers tied to long bamboo hawsers, while they pull junks\r\nthrough the terrific rapids of the noble Yangtze gorges between Ichang\r\nand Wan Hsien. Men for thousands of years have also supplied with their\r\nlegs the motive power of irrigation wheels for raising water, and of\r\ntread wheels for turning paddles. Billions of tons of freight have been\r\ncarried on the backs and from the shoulders of men, women and children\r\nover the hundreds of mountain passes on the great trade routes of\r\nmountainous China, such as the steep Mei Ling pass of Kwangtung, the\r\nTangyueh pass of Yunnan, the Tachien pass into Tibet, etc. Hongkong’s\r\nthousand palatial villas and châteaux eighteen hundred feet above the\r\nclouds were carried up brick by brick and stone by stone in baskets and\r\non bamboos balanced on the bare shoulders of human beings, who panted\r\npiteously in a stifling hot and humid atmosphere in the equator region.\r\nMen have pumped the brine from the deepest brine wells in the world.\r\nTheir arms have lifted the weights that have driven the wells for gas\r\nand brine. A pulley, a rope, an endless chain, have been unknown, and\r\nhearts and feet have strained up the thirteen stories of the pagodas\r\nwith the coping stone and upcurled eaves. The day of labor-saving\r\ndevices dawns for a China whose population is going to decrease\r\nwithin reason, not with the intent to starve labor, but so that labor\r\nmay devote itself to better-paying work. Government officials only\r\ncan supervise this condition in China or in America, government’s\r\nwork being to govern the big as well as the small, as we are just\r\ndiscovering in the West.\r\n\r\nShopping has been done by a tedious system of bargaining extending over\r\ndays, the contract concluding with a shout of “Mai Te” (sale attained),\r\nwhich corresponds with our stock exchange phrase of “Bid taken.”\r\nDoubtless the modern Chinese will adopt the Anglo-Saxon method of\r\nsaving time and coming to a decision quicker. Healthy competition will\r\nbring this about.\r\n\r\nMany guilds and Chinese merchants continue the old custom of sending\r\nletters from city to city by messenger or trusted traveler. Hongkong\r\nhas attacked this competition with the government post-office by fining\r\nthose who deliver private letters from out-ports, though Hongkong\r\npermits private delivery by the excellent “chit-book” system within the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nChina is finding that she can knit her own goods, and she will\r\nsoon import yarns mainly. I shall instance the Wei San factory as a\r\nsample of five factories in Hongkong. Canton has ten factories, and\r\nKwangtung province has many more, not to speak of the immense number\r\nof hand-knitting machines which the Japanese and the Germans are\r\nsupplying. Tientsin and Shanghai have several knitting factories, and\r\nmuch foreign machinery will be needed throughout the land, especially\r\nin the Yangtze valley.\r\n\r\nUp to Viceroy Chang Chih Tung’s régime in Hupeh in 1906, China scraped\r\nand raked the whole world for cargoes of old horseshoes and iron scrap,\r\nbut since the blast furnaces at Hanyang have been a success, China is\r\ndoing considerable smelting of ore, of which she has beds almost as\r\nrich as her coal and lime beds. The largest iron mines now worked are\r\nat Phing Ting in eastern Shansi province and Tayeh in eastern Hupeh\r\nprovince. The Hanyang smelters supply the rail mills of Hanyang, and\r\nalso ship pig iron to the Wakamatsu iron works on Kyushu Island, Japan;\r\n40,000 tons of pig to the Western Steel Corporation of Seattle, and to\r\nthe eastern seaboard of America, as well as to Hongkong, on occasions.\r\nThere is iron ore in more than half of the provinces, notably in\r\nKiangsu (near Nanking); Nganhwei and Kiangsi, besides the provinces\r\nmentioned. China is already turning out 400,000 tons of iron ore a\r\nyear, largely by primitive methods. The Han Yeh Ping Iron and Coal\r\nCompany at Hanyang, Hupeh province, has three German blast furnaces,\r\neight Siemens-Martin open-hearth furnaces, a rolling-mill of one\r\nthousand tons a day, blooming mills and a foundry. The cranes are run\r\nby electricity. The iron ore and limestone are secured at Tayeh eighty\r\nmiles down the Yangtze from Hankau. Here a whole range of hills is full\r\nof hematite ore. A railway of fifteen miles brings the ore to the\r\nYangtze River, where it is loaded on junks and towed by steam launches\r\nup to Hanyang.\r\n\r\nAmong the Chinese companies (stock held by Chinese and foreigners)\r\nwhich have been managed successfully are the Taku (Tientsin) Tug\r\nand Lighter Company; Shanghai Tug and Lighter; Shanghai Dock and\r\nEngineering; Shanghai and Hongkew Wharf Company; China Oil Company;\r\nTientsin Iron Works; Union, Yangtze, North China and Canton Marine\r\nInsurance Company; Hongkong, Canton, Yangtze, North China and China\r\nFire Insurance Companies; China Merchants’ Steamship Company; Ewo,\r\nShanghai and Soy Chee Cotton Mills; Hai Ho Conservancy (Tientsin);\r\nChing Ching Mining Company; Kiangnan Dock and Ship-building at\r\nShanghai; Yangtzepoo Dock and Ship-building at Shanghai; Vulcan\r\nIron and Car Works; Han Yeh Ping steel plant at Hanyang; colliery\r\nat Pinghsiang; iron mines at Tayeh; Commercial Press of Shanghai in\r\npublishing; Chee Hsin Cement Company (at Tayeh, Hupeh).\r\n\r\nIn joint stock organization, China will for a while suffer from two\r\nthings, nepotism and graft. We have ourselves not yet emerged from\r\nstaffing companies with inexperienced and dummy relatives, and from\r\nplundering the corporation exchequer. The Shanghai taotai who decamped\r\nduring the rubber panic of 1910, having given several million dollars\r\nof fiduciary funds to friends, will never be forgotten in the Paris\r\nof the East. No more however will the “squeezing” Manchu mandarin\r\ncome down “like a wolf on the fold” on struggling concerns or private\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nChina mines only 15,000,000 tons of coal yearly, mainly at the\r\nfollowing mines:\r\n\r\nKaiping (near Tientsin), in Pechili province; Wei Hsien, in Honan\r\n(anthracite).\r\n\r\nPingsiang, in Kiangsi province; Lin Cheng, in Pechili (anthracite).\r\n\r\nFangtsze (near Tsinan), in Shangtung province.\r\n\r\nLung Wang (near Chungking), in Szechuen province.\r\n\r\nTse Chow, in Shansi province.\r\n\r\nChing-Ching, in Shansi province (anthracite).\r\n\r\nPao Chin, in Shansi province (anthracite).\r\n\r\nFushun (near Mukden), in Manchuria (owned and operated by Japanese).\r\n\r\nHeijo (near Chemulpo), in Korea (owned and operated by Japanese).\r\n\r\nPing Yang, in Korea (owned and operated by Japanese).\r\n\r\nHungay and Kebao, in Tonquin (owned and operated by French and Hongkong\r\ncapitalists).\r\n\r\nThis of course is only a beginning. On account of poor transportation\r\nby rail and canal, China imports about 2,000,000 tons of Japanese\r\ncoal, and Hongkong and Shanghai import Australian and Welsh coal,\r\nsome of it for admiralty purposes. The largest anthracite mines now\r\nopen are, in their order, in Shansi, Honan, Pechili and Shangtung\r\nprovinces; the bituminous as far as mined, in their order, in Pechili,\r\nKiangsi, Shensi, Kansu, Shangtung, Szechuen, Yunnan, Kweichou, Hunan\r\nand Kwangsi provinces. Over a million tons of lignite are mined yearly\r\nin Manchuria. England has a coal supply for only one hundred and fifty\r\nyears, and America’s supply will not last much longer. This means\r\nthat China will step full-panoplied into the coal and iron arena with\r\nplethoric supplies which, with her population, will make her probably\r\nthe world’s richest nation, in material resources, if not in brains.\r\nThe first shipment of Chinese coal for America occurred in July,\r\n1910, when the steamer _Inverkip_ called at Ching Wang Tao on the Gulf\r\nof Pechili and loaded the famous Kaiping coal for San Francisco. The\r\nBritish Peking Syndicate, mining anthracite coal in Shansi province,\r\npurposes to build colliers to take coal to America. Coal costs at\r\nthe mines only seventy-five cents a ton, and with machinery opulent\r\nChina could reduce this cost. It is a knowledge of the potentiality of\r\nthis great wealth that kindled some of the fire of the October, 1911,\r\nrevolution, and led the provincial assemblies of Szechuen and Hupeh to\r\nsay: “China’s mines and transportation franchises shall not be passed\r\nover to foreigners.” The Peking Syndicate, mainly British, operating\r\nhard coal and iron mines in Shansi, is capitalized at $6,000,000. The\r\nChinese Engineering and Mining Company has a capital of $5,000,000.\r\nIt has for many years operated the famous Kaiping coal mines north of\r\nTientsin. This is the company which employed Mr. Kinder, the British\r\nengineer, who surreptitiously built the “Rocket,” the first locomotive\r\nused continuously in China.\r\n\r\nA wonderful tin mine has been worked for many years at Kuo Chao, in the\r\nsoutheast corner of Yunnan province, the tin being exported through\r\nMengtsu. It used to seek Hongkong via the Red River and Haiphong and\r\nsometimes via Nanning, the West River and Canton. The costly narrow\r\ngage railway which the French have run from Haiphong to Yunnan now\r\ncatches nearly all of this product. There is much complaint regarding\r\nrates, which are based “on all the traffic will bear,” and it is\r\nproposed by the Chinese to build a railway to Nanning, and send the tin\r\nthe remainder of the way by junk and launch. This rich mine produces\r\nabout 15,000,000 pounds a year, valued at nearly $6,000,000, and now\r\nthat German machinery and German experts have been introduced by\r\nthe Chinese miners, a greater and a purer product will result. Until\r\nrecently the product had to be resmelted at Hongkong. Of course,\r\ngreat as this product is, the Straits Settlements still lead in tin\r\nmining. There are 30,000 miners (mostly boys, on account of the narrow\r\nunhealthy shafts) at Kuo Chao, and owners, miners, smelters, porters\r\nand the government representatives all have their compulsory labor\r\nunions. This protection of labor must be copied in all countries, the\r\ngovernment forcing the laborer to protect himself, and making the\r\nindustry share in the cost of government supervision. Charcoal is used\r\nas fuel at the clay smelters, and the bellows are hand-worked.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, Southern China is cursed with white ants and\r\nhumidity. The former eat the wooden beams, and the latter rusts iron\r\nbeams. Ceilings have to be perforated to admit air and light between\r\nthe floors so as to keep down the ravages of the white ant. However,\r\nSouthern China is copying Hongkong’s example and risking metal beams\r\nand ceilings, the trouble being to find a suitable protective paint.\r\nChina has graphite, lead for oxides, carbon, silica, and oils in\r\nabundance, and she will in time manufacture her own protective paints,\r\nbut we shall supply the machinery. Brass hardware is used instead of\r\niron on account of the humidity.\r\n\r\nThe important copper mines of Yunnan were worked as a Manchu monopoly.\r\nHunan is perhaps the next richest province, with Szechuen, Shansi and\r\nKweichou following, although every province has copper. Nickel mines\r\nexist in Yunnan, Kwangsi and other southern provinces.\r\n\r\nThe first engagement between the two immense sugar refineries\r\n(Butterfield’s and Jardine’s) at Hongkong and the great refiners of\r\nFormosa has been won by the latter, which were helped until recently\r\nby indirect Japanese subsidies. When the Sugar Trust, after the\r\ngovernment fine and municipal suit, jumped the price two cents a pound,\r\nin 1911, if America had a Price Board at the head of affairs to induce\r\nCongress to act as was done in the coal shortage, Formosa and Hongkong\r\nsugar could have flooded the country until the price was restored\r\nto the five cents rate, or about that rate. The immense Hongkong\r\nrefineries (Taikoo and China Sugar) use Javan raw sugar. The Formosa\r\nrefineries use their local raw. They not only supply Japan under a\r\nprotective tariff, but have enough to supply China. Formosa produces\r\n600,000,000 pounds a year, and could handily double the amount. America\r\nhas the Louisiana, Hawaii and Philippine cane fields to protect, it is\r\ntrue, but if sugar rises over five and one-half cents a pound retail,\r\nthe insistent knockers at the high door, Formosan and Hongkong sugars,\r\nmight be allowed to come in, as the tariff-enslaved countries are going\r\nto heed the new cry that food, clothing and building material must be\r\nduty-free, or nearly so.\r\n\r\nFlake and amorphous graphite are mined in the Ping An section of\r\nnorthern Korea, and Japan will, therefore, enter into the manufacture\r\nof crucibles, lubricants, pencils and steel-paint.\r\n\r\nChina continues to use the earthenware jar and the paper bottle,\r\nreinforced with bamboo withes, to transport her valuable nut, bean\r\nand seed oils. Sometimes staves are brought in by foreigners and set\r\nup at Hankau, Newchwang, etc., in barrels, but it would seem that tin\r\nwould eventually come into use, with the idea of conserving wood.\r\nThe earthenware and bamboo paper containers are the ideal from a\r\nconservation point of view, but they are too tender and risky for\r\nmovement abroad. The Hanyang plant will probably have the first tinware\r\nfactory.\r\n\r\nThe royalty imposed in Korea for mining by the Japanese government is\r\nthirty per cent. of the net revenue. The Chinese royalty is twenty-five\r\nper cent. in general, plus an additional twenty per cent. in the case\r\nof precious stones, ten per cent. in gold, silver and quicksilver\r\nmines; five per cent. in coal and iron; and export duty of five per\r\ncent., and likin (inland customs and provincial transportation tax,\r\nliterally “cash a catty”) two per cent. As China’s mines are more\r\nlucrative, this royalty is not so onerous as the comparison would seem\r\nto make it, and the tendency is to reduce it, under the new government.\r\n\r\nThe ship-building and dock facilities of the Far East have fully risen\r\nto the demands. The three largest are at Hongkong, all British owned.\r\nThe Hongkong and Whampoa Dock Company on the China mainland of Hongkong\r\n(Kowloon), and at Aberdeen on Hongkong Island, over the mountains\r\nfrom the city of Victoria, has six docks, one of them seven hundred\r\nfeet long on the keel blocks. The company builds ships, locomotives,\r\ncars, bridges, engines, motor-boats, boilers, machinery, and, indeed,\r\nanything after the steel is furnished to them, by Britain chiefly.\r\n\r\nThe Taikoo Dock (Butterfield & Swire) on the eastern end of Hongkong\r\nIsland has a dock 787 feet long, and is also equipped to turn out the\r\nlargest ships.\r\n\r\nThe Admiralty Dock of the British Navy on Hongkong Island was built\r\nfrom shore in the center of the city of Victoria, into the water by\r\nreclamation, instead of being cut out of the rock, as was done with the\r\nother docks. It is equipped to handle large battleships, and can be\r\nused by the mercantile marine in an emergency.\r\n\r\nThe Tanjong Pagar Dock at Singapore is equipped to handle battleships\r\nand maritime vessels. It is controlled by the Crown Colony.\r\n\r\nThe Mitsu Bishi Dock, cut out of the high rock at Nagasaki, has one\r\ndock 722 feet long. This company built the new 19,000 tons displacement\r\nships, oil burners, of the Toyo Kisen Kaisha for the San Francisco\r\nroute, and like the Hongkong and Whampoa Dock it always has large\r\nsalvage steamers ready to go to the rescue of wrecks, now that wireless\r\nhas been established in the Orient. There have been some wonderful\r\nexpeditions of help recently on the romantic seas of the Far East.\r\n\r\nThe Kawasaki Dock Company at Dairen, South Manchuria, has a dock 380\r\nfeet long, together with the usual machine and boiler shops. There is\r\na commercial dock at Kobe, the Harima Dock at Oh, and large government\r\ndocks and arsenals at Yokosuka (near Yokohama), Kure and Sasebo. The\r\nlast named dock, 777 feet long, built the dreadnought battleship\r\n_Kawachi_, 21,000 tons.\r\n\r\nThe Kiangnan Dock and Engineering Works, Shanghai (Chinese), built the\r\nimperial yacht once owned by Prince Tsui, and small cruisers which the\r\nrepublicans seized. It has a dock 575 feet long on the blocks, and has\r\nthe usual machine and boiler shops. The Yangtzepoo Dock at Shanghai\r\n(Chinese and foreign owned) has a dock 455 feet long on the blocks.\r\n\r\nThe Shanghai Dock and Engineering Company (Chinese and foreign) has\r\ndocks 560 feet long, where some of the vessels for the Philippine\r\ngovernment were built in 1912.\r\n\r\nThe Tsingtauer Werft, owned by the Germans, has a floating dock at\r\nTsingtau, Kiaochou, Shangtung, China, lifting vessels 460 feet long,\r\nand there is the immense floating dock, “Dewey”, of the American navy,\r\nat Cavite, Manila, which does not refuse to do a friendly act for\r\nmaritime commerce, when necessary, if the ships are not over 600 feet\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nThe French have small docks at Haiphong and Saigon. It will be seen\r\nthat as far as taking care of battleships is concerned, only Britain\r\nand Japan have more than one string to the bow, Britain being easily\r\nin the lead. America has only one dock, and that a floating one.\r\nIt could not lift a dreadnought, and therefore America has in the\r\nmeantime wisely moved her first defense line, as I think the writer,\r\nThomas Millard, a Shanghai American, recommended in his books, back\r\nto Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, counting on Cavite, Philippines, as a picket\r\npost. Germany at Kiaochou, and Russia at Vladivostok are as yet out of\r\nthe running, with inferior docking accommodations. The Russians are\r\nspending $10,000,000 in Vladivostok on a floating dock, ice-breakers\r\nand a wharf. As far as America is concerned, she can count on Britain.\r\nDewey fitted out at Mirs Bay, Hongkong, despite all conventions. As\r\nCommander Tatnall said at Taku in China, “Blood is thicker than water,”\r\nwhich was reciprocated by Admiral Seymour at Manila. When Admiral\r\nDiedrichs asked what the British would do if the Germans fired on the\r\nAmericans, Seymour replied: “You had better ask Admiral Dewey, who is\r\ninformed.” That is the story that goes the rounds in the East, and if\r\nit is not wholly true in fact, it is so potentially.\r\n\r\nThere is a growing number of smaller Chinese docks, machine shops and\r\nways. Inland at the Pinghsiang colliery on the borders of Kiangsi and\r\nHunan provinces, China has machine shops fitted to turn out almost\r\nanything, and the Hanyang Steel Works, across from Hankau, have been\r\nalready described. Railway shops are opening up everywhere, and do\r\ncreditable work, especially the North China railway at Tongshan; the\r\nShanghai & Nanking Railway shops at Wusung, near Shanghai, and the\r\nHongkong and Whompoa Dock shops. The Vulcan Iron Works at Shanghai\r\nconstruct railway and street-cars.\r\n\r\nThe immense cement works which are already in operation are the\r\nIndo-China Cement Company at Haiphong, in Tonquin (French); Tayeh, in\r\nHupeh province (Chinese); Chee Hsin Cement Company, at Tongshan, near\r\nTientsin (Chinese); Green Island Cement Company, at Macao and Hongkong\r\n(British and Chinese). Half of the many bridges that are being erected\r\nfor the immense transportation development throughout China and the\r\nPhilippines are made of this new concrete.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese furniture makers of Ningpo, Yunnan, Shanghai, Hongkong\r\nand Canton, are famous. They copy foreign models and also execute the\r\nnative designs. The artistic cabinet work of Li Kwong Loong can be\r\nseen in the Shanghai and Hongkong clubs, in the Hongkong Hotel, and\r\nin Watson’s Store at Hongkong. The best effects are in the prized\r\nteakwood, which is becoming the rage in San Francisco. Vantine’s and\r\nthe Metropolitan Museum, New York, exhibit specimens of the careful and\r\nstrong handwork of these Chippendales of the land of Han. China can\r\ntake care of herself in furniture making if time is not of the “essence\r\nof importance.” Loving art, I would not recommend sending her our\r\nmachinery for furniture, but if government schools and offices are to\r\nbe supplied quickly, I suppose we shall be compelled to make esthetics\r\nsurrender to utility here also!\r\n\r\nThe Germans plan to meet the leadership of America, Britain and Japan\r\nin technical instruction in China. The British and Americans control\r\nthe Tongshan Engineering School at Tongshan, and the Americans are\r\npowerful in the Pei Yang Science College at Tientsin. At Mukden the\r\nJapanese are influential. At the mechanical shops at Hongkong, Shanghai\r\nand Hankau the British are influential. The Germans plan, with the\r\naid of Krupps, their foreign office and the Deutsche Asiatische Bank,\r\nto establish a central engineering college at Tsingtau, Shangtung\r\nprovince, with branches possibly at Hankau and Kaiphong. They believe\r\nthat the graduates will order German machinery and material for China’s\r\ncoming prodigious development.\r\n\r\nThe American government has included in its humanitarian pure food laws\r\na prohibition on the importation of green tea, which is colored in the\r\npot over the fire with Prussian blue, indigo, talc and gypsum. This\r\nchanges the leaf from its flat state and dull yellow and green color\r\nto a ball state, colored lustrous emerald, and increases the aromatic\r\nflavor slightly. The Chinese complain of having to pot-dry the green\r\ntea longer to preserve it under the new rule, and moreover old custom\r\ndies hard in China as far as agriculture is concerned. The American\r\ngovernment has done a world service in improving the quality of the\r\nideal beverage, and the Chinese, who do things by wholesale, will\r\ninsist in time that Australia and England, the champion tea-drinkers\r\nper capita, though not in bulk, shall take what the Americans have made\r\n“ploper fashion.” There were amusing instances of cousin John’s habit\r\nof “bluffing” laws on the maxim followed in more lands than in China,\r\n“If laws interfere with your business, why laws?” He heard of the May\r\n1, 1912, law of the Americans, but he sent his crop over just the same,\r\nsaying, “Surely America won’t put it back on my hands, as I haven’t got\r\nused to the law yet; like Mencius’ thief, I can only get used to law\r\ngradually!” Had America relented, John would have seen that his firers\r\nnever got used to our laws.\r\n\r\nChina formulated a patent and copyright office at Peking in 1905, but\r\nit has not yet reached efficiency for various reasons, one being that\r\nthe states’ rights feeling is stronger than the centralized government\r\nmovement up to date. In the meantime the district or municipal taotai\r\nwill, upon application of the foreign consul, issue a proclamation\r\nprohibiting all Chinese within his jurisdiction from manufacturing,\r\nselling or consuming property which is pirated; and such theft and\r\ninfringement are considered unpardonable by the great body of highly\r\nmoral Chinese guild merchants, as compared with the lack of similar\r\nhonor in the first days of modernized commercial Japan. Prosecutions\r\nhave been actually carried on in the mixed courts of foreign consuls\r\nand Chinese taotais against Chinese dealers for handling goods made\r\nin Europe and imported into China under marks similar to American\r\nmarks registered with the taotai, and the dealers, whether ignorant or\r\nnot, have been convicted and severely punished. Until China is able\r\nto establish an efficient patent department the method that should\r\nbe followed is to register the mark or patent at the consul’s and\r\ntaotai’s office in each province and port where the goods are to be\r\nsold. This will answer very satisfactorily until the growth of trade,\r\ntransportation and machinery of government make the central government\r\nmore familiar with modern business methods and international law. It is\r\nimportant in China and absolutely essential in Japan for the foreigner\r\nto register his patent promptly, for a pirate may precede him and cause\r\nirrevocable loss, in Japan at least.\r\n\r\nI want to portray a Chinese character as a type of one interesting and\r\npowerful set of men with whom the West will now come in contact. Ah\r\nChuk (I shall call that his name for present purposes) was a Cantonese\r\nabout fifty-five years of age, though he looked much older because of\r\nhis parchment face. He had few of his teeth, because he lived in the\r\ndays before the advent of foreign-trained dentists. In his youth he\r\ndid not fear to strike. His race were the men who had set in motion\r\nthe greatest rebellion ever known, the Taiping scourge. My patriotic\r\nand legal duty was to obey the law in spirit and in letter, and in\r\naddition, under no circumstances to lose temper, but to treat Chuk\r\nwith unfailing manners. Chuk was the only Chinese whom I ever knew who\r\ndisobeyed his Confucian code of flowery courtesy (Li). He hated me,\r\nas he bitterly hated all who firmly withstood him, and he showed his\r\nfeelings on every occasion. His gods were not Buddha, but money and\r\npower. On one occasion he said: “I can get you a Chinese slave girl for\r\nfour hundred dollars.” I replied: “You insult me, Chuk.” He hissed, “I\r\nmeant to.” He asked me why I could not obey the letter of the law and\r\nnot the spirit, and I told him that an Occidental corporation employé,\r\nlike the soldier, was expected to be absolutely loyal to orders. He\r\nsaid I was a fool because I made a god of conscience, instead of\r\nexpediency; that I had no tact. I replied by quoting their maxim; “Tact\r\nis the discounting of principle in the mart of expediency.”\r\n\r\nHe feared neither the American, British or Chinese governments, nor the\r\nrich corporation. He corrupted foreign consulates in the old days when\r\nforged citizenship certificates were not unknown. He bullied the Canton\r\nviceroy. He was lord over half a dozen valleys and a hundred hamlets of\r\nKwangtung province, whose inhabitants were his slaves, because they had\r\nsigned bonds of $1,000 each for every Chinese whom he safely got into\r\nthat Eldorado, America. He did not press the man in America any more\r\nthan he would attempt to press a man in Mars. He pressed his father,\r\nhis relatives in Kwangtung, who were on the bond also, for the payment\r\nof the $1,000, and it took the son in America twenty years to pay the\r\nmoney and the heavy interest. With his foot on the sacred bones of his\r\ngrandfather he held the grandson in America in constant fear.\r\n\r\nHe was lord of the underground routes which ran to South Africa,\r\nAmerica, Australia, Mexico, Canada and wherever Chinese laborers are\r\nnot received free. He seldom dressed well; it did not do in those days\r\nto look opulent in China, and besides American inspectors might suspect\r\na well-dressed dealer in contract slaves. His voice, unlike the usual\r\npliable voice of his race, was deep in his raucous throat. He would\r\nnot fear to take life if he had a chance in the lonely walks of his\r\nprovince, if his opponent was a strong obstacle to his worship of his\r\ntwo gods, money and power. He could not get in as many as he wanted\r\nby the direct route, so he determined to institute the first Chinese\r\ntrans-Pacific steamship company, crossing the Pacific to Mexico. I\r\ntold him that he never could get the money, as Queen’s Road, Hongkong,\r\nwas a long way from Wall Street; that he would sink a million of the\r\nmoney of his beloved countrymen. He got the money from the Chinese,\r\nintensely conservative as they were, which proved the power of his\r\npersuasion, and he sank it all in two years. He could not be drawn into\r\nmuch expression by me, though he could speak English well. I heard him,\r\nhowever, speaking like a Rooseveltian tornado of storm and lightning\r\nunto his own, and once to two foreigners in whom he trusted, because\r\nthey had obeyed him at their risk, and he owned them by the bribes they\r\nhad accepted. His will was of iron, unyielding. His persistency was as\r\ntireless as Napoleon’s, and his swift victories were many. He could\r\nlive without sleep when he planned his campaigns. He would go anywhere\r\nand to anybody to accomplish his aims. He loved whispering. He cast\r\nlooks which wielded men. He swept like a vulture on lambs. He struck at\r\nhis opponents like a tiger. He was not a Manchu, but he was Manchuized\r\nin his confidence that the Oriental was superior to the foreigner. I\r\nshall never forget the time when he told me that he had “a white man\r\nworking for him.” That white man was descended in the third generation\r\nfrom a brother of a president of America.\r\n\r\nChuk was not uncomfortable when he thus wore the crown. He ruled over\r\nhis subject races of the West with all the assurance which Xerxes or\r\nKublai Khan did. He could plot; he could bribe; he could threat; he\r\ncould spend with a lavish hand. One time he would travel in state at\r\nhome and abroad, and on another occasion incognito like a spy. He felt\r\nhe was abler than any white man because he added the easier conscience\r\nof the Orient, which he called wisdom, to an ability equal to the white\r\nman’s, and a will just as imperious. He despised all religions as he\r\nsaid “conscience makes faint-hearts of us all.” He had no pity for his\r\ndupes or victims. He was a Cantonese Tippo Tib. I never know, when I\r\nam speaking to an American or Cuban Chinese, if he is not a slave of\r\nChuk’s, remitting to his old father in Kwangtung province, who will in\r\nturn remit to Chuk or Chuk’s heirs, to pay off that $1,000 and usurious\r\ninterest added. Chuk is a Cantonese example of the power which may\r\ncome to a money lord who has decapitalized labor, which will never\r\ncatch up with the principal. His profits on the real cost were 1,500\r\nper cent. Not even a surveillance of communications could probe Chuk’s\r\nunderground methods. Three insurmountable barriers interposed, the\r\nextent of the territory, the Chinese language, and the changing codes\r\nwhich he used. It would be as difficult as ferreting out a criminal\r\nin the Trastevere section of Rome, if for one reason alone, because\r\nthe Trasteverans will not turn informers. Neither will the Chinese.\r\nTherefore, with espionage of communications and informing for bribes\r\neliminated, a secret service on Chinese law breakers, as far as we are\r\nconcerned, is as yet in many respects ineffective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nFINANCE AND BUDGET IN CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a reformed system of tax collection the following budget is quite\r\nfeasible, and will, without any greater pressure on the individual than\r\nat present, lift China out of the slough of despond.\r\n\r\n    REVENUE                                        GOLD DOLLARS\r\n\r\n  Land tax, 400,000,000 acres cultivated, at 50c\r\n      a year                                       $200,000,000\r\n\r\n  Salt monopoly                                      10,000,000\r\n\r\n  Maritime customs                                   50,000,000\r\n\r\n  Railway surplus, nationalized trunk lines          10,000,000\r\n\r\n  Fisheries, tobacco, samshu, mining, steamship,\r\n      bank, incorporation, telegraph and\r\n      other fees                                     50,000,000\r\n\r\n  Income tax                                         10,000,000\r\n                                                   ------------\r\n                                                   $330,000,000\r\n\r\n    EXPENDITURE\r\n\r\n  Interest on foreign loans,--past, $200,000,000;\r\n      and in prospect, $200,000,000; total,\r\n      $400,000,000, at 4 per cent.                  $16,000,000\r\n\r\n  Civil service salaries, etc.                       30,000,000\r\n\r\n  Army, a full division for each province,\r\n      100,000 men at $100 a year                     10,000,000\r\n\r\n  Conservation, public works, repairing national\r\n      architecture, famine relief, etc               50,000,000\r\n\r\n  Navy for revenue purposes mainly, with one\r\n      dreadnought a year added                       24,000,000\r\n\r\n  Education and crafts schools                      100,000,000\r\n\r\n  Canals, railways, steamships, telegraph,\r\n      telephone, etc., extensions                   100,000,000\r\n                                                   ------------\r\n                                                   $330,000,000\r\n\r\nThis proposes $330,000,000 a year for 400,000,000 people, against\r\nJapan’s $350,000,000 a year for only 55,000,000 population. This plan\r\nwipes out the obnoxious opium and likin taxes. The taxes proposed are\r\nless than half per capita what poorer India is paying, and one-tenth of\r\nwhat Japan is paying, and so China would remain the lowest taxed nation\r\non the earth. The outstanding government debt of China, even including\r\nthe proposed four-nation loans of $50,000,000 gold for currency reform,\r\nand $50,000,000 for new Szechuen and Hunan province railways, is, as\r\nI have detailed elsewhere in this article, only £113,000,000, whereas\r\nthe present government debt of Japan, with infinitely less resources\r\nand population, is £300,000,000, not to speak of Japan’s private\r\nindustrial loans abroad, which would add another £60,000,000. India’s\r\ndebt is £170,000,000. The tax proposed in China is so small that room\r\nis left for each province to charge a door and head tax of 25c each\r\na year, bringing in an additional $100,000,000 gold for provincial\r\nrevenues to take care of justice, provincial public works, etc.\r\nMunicipalities could then raise their ordinary taxes in the usual way.\r\nAll that is wanted in China is an honest audit, the end of nepotism,\r\nand a cessation of “shaking the pagoda tree” by peculating officials.\r\nThe whole central and provincial tax would not amount to much over\r\n$1 a head a year, and the municipal taxes would not be any larger\r\nthan $1 per capita. This would not be a burden to cause complaint or\r\nrevolution. With the immense sum collected China would almost at once\r\ntake her place as one of the mightiest of nations. Her credit would\r\nbe enormous, and her opportunity for good the greatest in the world\r\nbecause of her wider ethnic connections. She would not need to raise\r\nher customs much above the present five per cent. ad valorem, and thus\r\noppressive monopolies could not grow up in the land. Free trade would\r\nflow to her with its riches, as it flowed to Britain, and every man\r\nwould have enough, and no man too much; certainly an ideal condition.\r\nThis budget would provide a splendid army of well-paid men ($8 gold\r\nper man per month is abundant); 100,000 strong, able to throw back\r\nany invasion at once, and always ready to keep down piracy. Riot and\r\nstrikes are not unpatriotic piracy; they are the localized suppuration\r\nof an economic distress that can be cured or forestalled in a democracy\r\nby other means than a soldiery, which we have found a failure in\r\nAmerica and Britain. The new Chinese navy could add a new dreadnought\r\nbattleship each year, and provide crews, yards, and a full revenue\r\nmarine. Above all, education and transportation would be taken care of\r\nlavishly, and China would not need to beg at any one’s door for a loan.\r\nShe would be a land of peace, because a total tax of $2 gold a year per\r\ncapita can raise not the slightest discontent in any land.\r\n\r\nThe debt of the Chinese government, contracted before October 13, 1911,\r\nwhich debt the republicans recognize, is as follows:\r\n\r\n                                  AMOUNT       AMOUNT\r\n        LOANS                      in £     Interest in £    DUE\r\n  7% silver loan, ’94            £490,500                   1924\r\n\r\n  6% gold loan, ’95               800,000                   1924\r\n\r\n  6% gold loan, ’95               333,400                   1915\r\n\r\n  5% gold loan, ’96, from\r\n    France and Russia\r\n    for Chinese-Eastern\r\n    Railway                    12,397,425                   1933\r\n\r\n  4½% gold, ’98, Britain\r\n    and Germany\r\n    for railways               14,022,625                   1933\r\n\r\n  5% gold railway loan          1,955,000                   1933\r\n\r\n  5% gold (Boxer\r\n    indemnities, etc.)         52,500,000                   1940\r\n\r\n  5% Shanghai-Nanking\r\n    railway                     2,900,000                   1915\r\n\r\n  5% Canton-Kowloon\r\n    railway                     1,500,000                   1920\r\n\r\n  5% Tientsin-Pukow\r\n    railway (British)           1,850,000                   1918\r\n\r\n  5% Tientsin-Pukow\r\n    railway (German)            1,100,000                   1918\r\n\r\n  5% Shanghai-Ningpo\r\n    railway                     1,500,000                   1918\r\n\r\n  5% Hukuang railways           1,500,000                   1921\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n      Total gov’t debts--\r\n  China                       £92,848,950    £4,642,000\r\n  Japan                       300,000,000    12,000,000\r\n  India                       170,000,000\r\n  Italy                     1,000,000,000\r\n  France                    1,200,000,000\r\n  Britain                   1,000,000,000\r\n  United States               200,000,000\r\n\r\nIf Japan returned to China the £35,000,000 indemnity coerced from her\r\nby the Shimonoseki treaty, the Chinese debt would be greatly reduced.\r\nThis is Japan’s moral duty, especially if she is allowed by the nations\r\nto retain Formosa, Korea, and possibly part of Manchuria, all of which\r\nshe plans to retain. Several of the European nations should follow\r\nAmerica’s example and return the excess in the Boxer indemnities. The\r\nbanking nations, as long as America and Britain retain their present\r\nhigh standard of altruism, will never again permit any power to wheedle\r\nan indemnity out of China.\r\n\r\nThe foreign and local banks operating in China are the following. I use\r\ngold dollars for the table:\r\n\r\n                                        CAPITAL\r\n        BANK                            PAID UP       RESERVE\r\n\r\n  Hongkong and Shanghai Banking\r\n    Corporation                       $5,000,000    $15,000,000\r\n\r\n  International Banking Company\r\n   of America                          3,250,000      3,250,000\r\n\r\n  Deutsche Asiatische Bank             5,500,000      3,000,000\r\n\r\n  Yokohama Specie Bank (Japan)        10,000,000      7,000,000\r\n\r\n  Lloyd’s Bank (British)              20,000,000     15,000,000\r\n\r\n  Chartered Bank of India, Australia\r\n    and China (British)                4,000,000      5,000,000\r\n\r\n  Netherlands Trading Society         18,000,000      2,000,000\r\n\r\n  Netherlands-India Commercial\r\n    Bank                               6,000,000        700,000\r\n\r\n  Russo-Asiatic Bank (Russia-France)  19,000,000      4,000,000\r\n\r\n  National Bank of China               1,500,000        400,000\r\n\r\n  Banque L’Indo-Chine (French)         6,000,000      3,000,000\r\n\r\n  Bank of Taiwan (Formosan Japan)      1,800,000        300,000\r\n\r\n  Mercantile Bank of India (British)   5,500,000        800,000\r\n\r\n  Eastern Bank (British)               2,000,000\r\n\r\n  Chino-Belgian Bank (Belgian)         2,000,000\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that with one exception all of these banks are strong\r\ninstitutions. The hoary patriarch among them, endowed with exhaustless\r\nstrength still, is the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, which\r\nhas been operating in China since 1865.\r\n\r\nThere is a movement in Canton to establish an “Industrial Encouragement\r\nBank”. The merchants are anxious for currency reform throughout the\r\nkingdom and the establishing of coins of fixed value on the American\r\ndecimal plan, but going to a lower decimal to accommodate small trade\r\nand the lower values of China.\r\n\r\nIt is also proposed by prominent members of the Nanking Assembly to\r\nestablish a Sino-American bank, plans for which were laid just before\r\nthe October, 1911, revolution.\r\n\r\nAt the height of the revolution in November, 1911, the rebels did a\r\nremarkable thing successfully at Shanghai. The loyalists at Peking were\r\nunable either with their own imperial Ta-Ching bank, foreign loans, or\r\nthe immense ramifications of the Shansi Bank guilds, to uphold their\r\ncredit, and the chief fighter of the Manchus, General Chang Hsun Chung,\r\ncould not pay his troops. The republicans at Shanghai under Sheng\r\nWan Yung, minister of finance, and Wu Ting Fang, foreign secretary,\r\norganized the “Chung Hua” Bank at Shanghai with a capital of 5,000,000\r\ntaels. The shops immediately took the money at a high premium,\r\ndoubtless to give an impetus to confidence. “Chung Hua” is the Chinese\r\nname for China. It means “central glory”.\r\n\r\nNothing hampers China’s interprovincial trade more than the absence\r\nof a national credit system and commercial paper. Treaty-port China\r\ngets long enough loans from the foreign manufacturer. The trouble is\r\nthat the importer can not collect quickly from his customer, and when\r\nhe does, the medium is coin, bullion and barter, unnecessarily and\r\nclumsily handled, whereas coin, bullion and barter should only be used\r\nfor the balances. China needs a modern currency system, and a modern\r\ncredit system as well.\r\n\r\nIt is in accord with manners and business accuracy when at a fair\r\nyou are informed that an article will cost you a thousand coins\r\n(cash) to say: “I’ll pay you 500 _good_ coins.” If you had a thousand\r\ncounterfeits you could elect to pay with them, but never be so bucolic\r\nas to pay a thousand good coins when a thousand coins are asked.\r\nAs suggested by America, China’s new coinage will have a silver\r\ndollar, half, quarter, dime, nickel, two cents, cent, half a cent,\r\nand one-tenth of a cent, all minted in government mints, and alone\r\naccepted as legal tender in taxes, telegraph, railway, telephone,\r\ncustoms, likin, stamp and other charges. Very slowly the old system of\r\nusing provincial coinage of debased value, bullion (sycee) exchange,\r\nprivate bank notes, etc., will pass away. A central bank, like the Ta\r\nChing, helped by a four-nations foreign loan, backed 40 per cent. by\r\nthe government, and 60 per cent. by private subscriptions, with about\r\n$6,000,000 capital, could make a good beginning in taking care of the\r\nnew system. Although a silver coinage, the government, like Japan’s,\r\nstands to guarantee the fixed value of the coinage as equal to half\r\nits face in gold; that is to say, the central bank will hold reserves\r\nso as to redeem or guarantee a silver dollar at fifty cents gold. The\r\nsilver is to have a fixed purity standard, like the Philippine peso,\r\nor the American dollar. Japan stepped into Korea and refused to accept\r\nthe old coinage. It immediately became copper bullion, and had no\r\nother value. For safety’s sake, the Japanese insisted that the coins,\r\nworth nominally one-tenth of a cent, should be broken at the square\r\nhole in the center. The steamer _Seneca_, in 1912, brought 1,400 tons\r\nof these broken Korean coins to New York, whence they were shipped to\r\nChrome, New Jersey, to be smelted. China can not be so rigid, as she\r\nhas not the police or army, but if she could safely be rigid, nothing\r\nwould clear up the coinage question better than copying this Japanese\r\nexample. Since the adoption of the gold standard in Mexico, the\r\ngovernment has to accept the old Mexican dollar as legal tender for one\r\ndollar gold, which gives a profit of 100 per cent. to the lucky holders\r\nof these silver dollars. There are many of them in China; indeed the\r\nMexican dollar was for many years the monetary standard in China, and\r\nthe thrifty Chinese are smuggling the unchopped coins into Mexico as\r\nfast as they can be gathered up from the Shansi, Kwangtung and other\r\nbankers. The Mexican government anticipated this move, and placed a\r\nduty on Mexican dollars returned from abroad. The honors are even along\r\nthe Rio Grande boundary; Mexican dollars are smuggled southward, and\r\nMexican Chinese are smuggled northward! Most of the Mexican dollars\r\nin China, however, have been chopped in the banks and fan-tan houses,\r\nand the thrifty Chinese shroffs groan when they contemplate that by\r\negotistically sinking their chop into the face of the Aztec eagle and\r\nthe Texoco snake, they have now lost 100 per cent. profit. Moral: never\r\nmutilate the coin of a realm, whether it is your own country or not.\r\n\r\nAs illustrating the irregularity of the currency, let us cite the\r\nsituation at Newchwang in 1912 for instance. National taxes are paid\r\nin Kuping taels; provincial taxes in Manchurian dollars. Customs\r\nduties are paid in the usual Haikwan taels; local octroi in small\r\nsilver. The national post-office will only accept Mexican dollars. The\r\nnational telegraph office will only accept Manchurian dollars. The\r\nnational Chinese railway cashiers must receive payment of freight\r\nbills in either Peiyang or Kiauchou (German) dollars. The pursers of\r\nthe national China Merchants’ Steamship Company demand payment of fares\r\nin either Mexican dollars or Newchwang taels. The Japanese, who run a\r\nrailway, a concession, public utility works and a hotel here, demand\r\npayment of their bills in the Japanese silver yen (dollar). On their\r\nrailway line they demand payment in the Japanese gold yen. The Russian\r\ndemands payment in his paper ruble note. The Americans and the English\r\ndemand payment respectively in eagles and sovereigns. All of these\r\nconcerns will discount other moneys at a heavy profit, so that they,\r\nand the money changers, in the multiplicity of standards, soon shave\r\nthe dollar down till its pride and distinction of stamp are humble and\r\nthin enough! A tael, the old monetary system, is a Chinese ounce equal\r\nto 1⅓ ounces avoirdupois. The Haikwan tael, the standard of fineness\r\naccepted by the Custom House, is rated at 100, in comparison with which\r\nare the Tientsin tael at 105; the Hankau and Newchwang at 108, and the\r\nShanghai at 111. When new silver arrived at the old provincial mints,\r\nit was refined or adulterated to conform with these grades. The edict\r\nof October 5, 1908, suggested that if the standardization of silver was\r\nsuccessful, a gold standard might be looked for. This would probably\r\nslightly raise wages and costs in China, and slightly decrease them\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe national customs, heretofore called the “Imperial Customs”, managed\r\nfrom Peking in succession by the British knights, Robert Hart, Bredon\r\nand Aglen, continue to be the financial pillar of China, the basis of\r\nforeign loans, the payer of the hated indemnities, the provider of\r\narmies, pensions, and nearly all the machinery of government and even\r\n“graft”. Until a reorganization of the taxes is effected, the customs\r\nmight be raised to double what they now are so as to get China on her\r\nfeet. The department has been honestly managed, and is a monument\r\nto the late Sir Robert Hart, the sinologue. Where a missionary or a\r\nBuddhist monk is not at hand to take care of a needy traveler, there\r\nwill be found a national customs cadet, generally a Briton, an American\r\nor a German.\r\n\r\nHow China is neglected by London, the world’s banker, is illustrated\r\nby the following investments of new capital in a normal year, 1910.\r\nChina was given only $3,500,000 in 1909, and $8,000,000 in 1910,\r\nwhereas to nearly a billion already loaned, Japan was given $30,000,000\r\nmore in 1910; Mexico a like amount; Argentine, $112,000,000; Russia,\r\n$20,000,000; and even little Denmark, Greece, Turkey and Cuba each\r\nreceived as much as dormantly opulent and vast China. The neglect of\r\nChina by America reveals a similarly regrettable situation. Trade\r\nfollows the loan as much as it follows the flag and the missionary, as\r\nEngland’s trade relation with Argentine proves.\r\n\r\nThe famous Russo-Chinese Bank, which was the catspaw for the Russians\r\nin securing from the Chinese the troublesome concession for the\r\nChinese-Eastern railway, which largely led to the war with Japan, was\r\nabsorbed in a new institution in October, 1910, called the Banque\r\nRusso-Asiatique, which is largely financed by the Banque du Nord and\r\nthe _Société Générale_ of Paris. The old Russo-Chinese Bank had a\r\ncapitalization of 21,000,000 rubles, one-third of which was subscribed\r\nby China. The capitalization of the new bank is double that of the old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright, 1913, The Bobbs-Merrill Company.\r\n\r\n  The oldest and strongest bank operating in China; the Hongkong and\r\n    Shanghai Banking Corporation.

These are their\r\n    chambers of commerce and clubs combined, and are a power in the\r\n    new commercial China, almost equal to the new assemblies. The\r\n    heir of a tea magnate rides the statue of a griffin.\r\n]\r\n\r\nChina is suspicious regarding foreign loans, and many of the new China\r\nparty which precipitated the October, 1911, revolution are opposed\r\nto even railway loans. Objection has been made to one American loan\r\nthat it included, besides proper interest, a bonus of millions to\r\ntake up bonds of a previous American syndicate which never performed\r\nrailway work in China for those bonds; that is, they were organization\r\npaper, not property paper. Objection is also made that our loans\r\nname as security the perpetuation of the odious likin system which\r\ndisjoints the trade, politics and transportation of the provinces. The\r\nChinese of the south have constructed many short railroads, which are\r\nrun at a profit without foreign loans, and it is this system which\r\nthe “states’ rights” people wish to spread. Political and economical\r\neducation in the provincial assemblies will in time teach them the\r\nwisdom of the nationalization of trunk railways at least. There is\r\nthe same conflict in China between the states, or provinces, and the\r\nfederal power, as there is in other countries. In the matter of foreign\r\nloans, the provincial papers complain that the central government has\r\nsold the nation by paying bonuses and heavy interest. The trouble with\r\nprovincial loans for railways will be the mixed security offered, one\r\nprovince providing for the continuation of the objectionable likin,\r\nand another province withstanding it. It is a perfect curse along the\r\nmagnificent Shanghai-Nanking railway built by British contractors. The\r\nstrong desire of the provinces, in the first ebullition of patriotism,\r\nis to build and operate their railways without foreign aid or federal\r\nintervention.\r\n\r\nIn times of political trouble, the Chinese place vast sums in the\r\ntrust, not only of foreign banks at Tientsin, Shanghai and Hongkong,\r\nbut valuables and money are placed implicitly in the care of\r\nmissionaries, whose fiduciary honesty is esteemed by the Chinese, who,\r\nif they do not understand the text, understand the living example!\r\nThe missionary is not only a tower of “doctrine”, to use the Chinese\r\nidiom; he is a tower of finance also. It is a remarkable thing that\r\nwhen the white man’s honesty at home in certain scandals exposed by\r\ngovernment prosecutions, is rocking like a wooden steeple in the grasp\r\nof a tornado, the white man’s honesty in China is standing steadfast as\r\na rock, and unmoved in the typhoon of local and international distress,\r\nand political, religious and educational change. It seems that it is a\r\nwholesome time to send some of our monopolists to China, and bring some\r\nof our missionaries back to reform things at home!\r\n\r\nThe licensed pawnshops are called Tang Po Tien and Chi Tien. The “Yah”\r\npawnshop corresponds to our “fence” shop, to which thieves bring their\r\nplunder. The regular pawnshops are an embryo trust company. They loan\r\non land, crops, jewels, rent, bills receivable, possessions, houses.\r\nThey change money and sell notes of credit. The pawnshops of Mukden\r\nand the north loan on crops, such as beans, millet, etc. The visible\r\ngrain, and not a warehouse receipt, is the security, and therefore the\r\npawnshops of the north have yards and sheds in connection with the\r\nplant. The towering square pawnshops of Kwangtung province in the south\r\nare higher than in the other provinces, showing that capital circulates\r\nmore among the active Cantonese merchants. The Chinese of America are\r\nmainly Cantonese, or Kwangtungese; that is, if they are not of the\r\nprovincial capital, they are from the province.\r\n\r\nTrained carrier pigeons are still used by the Shansi Bankers’ Guilds in\r\ncarrying secret code messages stating the exchange prices of silver.\r\nThis is quicker than the post, and more secret than the telegraph.\r\n\r\nRegarding salaries that will be paid in China’s reconstruction, the\r\nfollowing may give some indication. The salary of advisers to the privy\r\ncouncil has been $90 per month in a nation of 400,000,000, compared to\r\nthe salary of an American attorney-general of $1,500 a month.\r\n\r\nIt is often said that the Chinese are absolutely honest, but when an\r\nexception occurs it is as startling as a bolt from a clear sky. As an\r\naftermath of the rubber speculation at Shanghai, the taotai, Tsai Nai\r\nHuong, absconded in August, 1911, owing several million dollars to the\r\ngovernment, which sum had been loaned him to assist the local banks.\r\n\r\nSome of their proverbs hung up as texts in their guild houses are:\r\n\r\n“Don’t wait till you are thirsty to dig your well.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t wait for the battle before you sharpen your sword.”\r\n\r\n“The higher up, the deeper down when the tumble comes.”\r\n\r\n“Fish and fools are the same; neither sees the string on every bait.”\r\n\r\n“The fish is measured by your bait.”\r\n\r\n“He who buys luxuries soon sells his necessities.”\r\n\r\n“A debtor never remembers as long as a creditor.”\r\n\r\n“Conscience grows heavier as store weights grow secretly lighter.”\r\n\r\n“Hot broth and a time loan both require deliberation.”\r\n\r\n“If you are rich and live in a desert, it’s never too far for your poor\r\nrelatives to come.”\r\n\r\n“If you have money, even your enemy will slave for you.”\r\n\r\n“There’s such a thing as drawing the line somewhere; I don’t lend my\r\numbrella in the dog-days.”\r\n\r\n“Some men’s faces are as good as a credit slip.”\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that they had a Franklin in China!\r\n\r\nThe idiom for a lunar eclipse is: “The moon has suffered a deficit,”\r\nbut the other expression of the Chinese astronomers: “All round\r\nagain”, indicates that losses have been underwritten and solvency\r\nreestablished! May the international financial astrologers in and out\r\nof China soon bring in this happy state. Then a “cycle of Cathay” will\r\nbe as good as any other cycle, despite Tennyson’s dictum, and this will\r\nredound to the good of every nation, particularly America and Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nBUSINESS METHODS OF FOREIGNERS IN CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe British national board of trade, partly on the advice in Admiral\r\nLord Beresford’s book, has appointed commercial attachés separate\r\nfrom the diplomatic and consular bodies to work as specialists and\r\nfree lances in China. In contrast with the diplomatic and consular\r\ndepartments, they are free to use the helpful publicity of the home\r\nnewspapers in order to correct and create interest. Canada in a small\r\nway has followed Britain’s example. A consular officer is fixed to his\r\npost on account of his daily relationship with shipping, courts, visits\r\nof nationals, emigration and health inspection. A commercial attaché\r\nhas more of a roving and special commission, and it is important in\r\nthe nature of his office that his advice should be followed promptly\r\nin China and at home. He is in a position to strike quickly and bring\r\ntrade to his flag. He is not necessarily that loathsome being which\r\nflourished in China previous to the Russo-Japanese War, a concession\r\nhunter and a looter of weak countries. His aim is to strengthen weak\r\ncountries, as he knows that only a rich and contented people can trade\r\nrichly with his flag. The more he is of a scholar, gentleman and\r\nChristian the better, for such a person in the long run makes an ideal\r\ntrader and patriot, as the American reformers are insisting. He should\r\nbe a statistician, an economist, and also an idealist, so that he may\r\nbe able to formulate a policy amid the present confused conditions. He\r\nis not in any sense a historian, for he is not to follow his country.\r\nHe is to lead it, and, moreover, he must also sympathize with the\r\nChinese point of view to a sufficient degree.\r\n\r\nEurope and America have been trading in China on an extended scale\r\nsince in 1842 the Nanking Treaty opened up Canton and four other ports.\r\nSurprisingly few traders have learned the language. The home-rule\r\nprinciple has been recognized, and the Chinese have been allowed to run\r\nthe trade in their own way on the compradore and shroff system. The\r\nforeign firm takes into its employ at a percentage, with a guaranteed\r\nminimum, a Chinese compradore, who speaks English, and who is bonded\r\nby the Chinese, and the compradore takes into his employ a shroff\r\ncashier, who is bonded to him by Chinese. The compradore pays the wages\r\nof his Chinese staff. The foreigner (Si Yang Jin--West Sea people)\r\nmust deal with the Chinese customers only through the compradore, and\r\nthe compradore must under no circumstances appeal to the head of the\r\nforeign firm in London, San Francisco, etc. He must deal with the\r\nagent or branch in the China port, in whose office he is located on\r\nthe first floor, with a Chinese staff as large as the foreign staff\r\nup-stairs. One who enters the offices of the Pacific Mail, American\r\n(International) Bank, Standard Oil, P. & O., Butterfield and Swire,\r\nJardine’s, Fearon’s, and other companies in China, might think at\r\nfirst that the concern was Chinese. No one but Celestials is to be\r\nseen. This system is an approximation of two views. The Chinese might\r\ndesire to handle his own trade, in which case the compradore would set\r\nup for himself, and buy sewing-machines, oils, machinery, tobacco,\r\ncotton, etc., direct from the foreign agent at the treaty port, or he\r\ncould ignore the foreign agent and send his Chinese buyer across to\r\nSan Francisco, or over to London. Or the foreigner might learn the\r\nlanguage, dismiss his compradore, and try to sell direct to the Chinese\r\nconsumer and Chinese merchant.\r\n\r\nIt is a world-trade question, a terrific struggle in economics, this\r\ngetting rid of the middleman, the drone, and it is therefore still\r\nan unsettled question in China. The compradore and shroff exist,\r\nalthough many foreign commercial travelers, especially Germans and\r\nJapanese, are selling direct to the Chinese in small lots. Many of\r\nthese compradores have become notable and able men, especially those\r\nemployed by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Again, some\r\ncompradores have tricked the foreign agent and company with all the\r\nlegerdemain of a conjurer. That is, instead of inducing the foreign\r\nagent to bring out large quantities of oil, flour, etc., we shall say,\r\nin time for a high market, the compradore, with his Chinese alliances\r\n(or conspirators, shall we say!) induces the agent to get stocked in\r\ngodown when a low market suddenly drops on him. The compradore shifts\r\nand says the market will drop lower still, and the agent authorizes\r\nthe compradore to sell quickly. The compradore sells to himself by\r\ndummy, and the oil or flour suddenly rises. The agent is mad clear\r\nthrough, but if he changed compradores every time this happened he\r\nwould change so frequently that his concern would lose prestige with\r\nthe Chinese. The Chinese compradore will bleed you, but he will not\r\nknowingly bleed you to death. Of all ornithologists of trade, he does\r\nnot believe in killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. He only\r\nplucks the goose occasionally! I have heard tales which, if they are\r\ntrue, would indicate that the Chinese compradore is not alone expert\r\nin legerdemain, but that the foreign agent sometimes “stands in” with\r\nhim. There certainly are some mountain palaces and a princely ménage on\r\nthe hills of the sumptuous Far East that the savings from an agent’s\r\nsalary, or an unexpected legacy never bought. In trade and in politics,\r\nas well as in religion, “by their fruits ye shall know” compradores,\r\nagents, and every one else!\r\n\r\nSuccessful companies operating in China, with foreign managers and with\r\nthe majority stock in foreign hands, but using Chinese money also, are\r\nthe following incorporated or joint-stock registered companies:\r\n\r\n  Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (British and German).\r\n  Indo-China Steam Navigation (British).\r\n  Peking Syndicate (British), Shansi and Honan anthracite coal.\r\n  Anglo-French Syndicate (Yunnan mines).\r\n  Anglo-French Land Investment Company.\r\n  Hongkong Land Investment Company.\r\n  Hongkong and Whompoa Dock Company.\r\n  Hongkong and Kowloon Wharf and Dock Company.\r\n  Green Island Cement Company (Hongkong and Macao).\r\n  Société Anonyme du Luhan (Belgian), s. e. Shansi coal.\r\n  Tientsin Land Investment Company.\r\n  Tientsin Gas and Electric Company.\r\n  Tientsin Water-works.\r\n  Hongkong, Canton and Macao Steamboat Company.\r\n  Hongkong Cotton Company.\r\n  Hongkong Rope Company.\r\n  Hongkong Dairy Company.\r\n  Chinese Engineering and Mining Company (British), Kaiping coal mines.\r\n\r\nThe immense Taikoo Company (Butterfield & Swire), operating docks,\r\nshipyards, sugar refineries, steamship lines, etc.; China Sugar\r\nRefinery; Bank of Australia; Eastern and Australia Cable Company, etc.,\r\nare owned mainly by British capitalists, who operate an extensive\r\napprentice system or school in maintaining their personnel in the\r\nFar East. The Banque l’Indo-China is, of course, mainly French, as\r\nis the Anglo-French Syndicate. The Russo-Asiatique Banque is French\r\nand Russian. The Cathay Trust Company is British and Chinese. The\r\nShell Transport (oil and shipping) is Dutch, largely. Humphreys’ Land\r\nCompany is British, mainly. There are scores of rubber companies whose\r\nplantations are in Malaysia, but whose shares are actively dealt in by\r\nthe Chinese and foreigners of Shanghai, Hongkong and Tientsin. Large\r\ndepartment stores of Hongkong and Shanghai are incorporated, and their\r\nshares are actively dealt in. I refer to Lane-Crawford, Watson, Central\r\nStores, Weeks, Moultrie, Hall & Holtz, etc.\r\n\r\nThe largest foreign commission houses, banks and agencies, with offices\r\nin the various treaty ports, are the following:\r\n\r\n  United States Steel Products Export Company (American).\r\n  Standard Oil Company (American).\r\n  American Tobacco Company.\r\n  Singer Sewing-Machine Company (American).\r\n  International Banking Company (American).\r\n  Yokohama Specie Bank (Japanese).\r\n  Deutsche-Asiatique Bank (German).\r\n  Mitsui & Co.

(German).\r\n  Kelly, Walsh & Co., Brewer & Co., _North China Herald_ (British),\r\n          publishers and booksellers.\r\n  Brunner Brothers (German), gas lighting.\r\n  Hohenzollern Company (German), locomotives.\r\n  Konigs Company (German), bridges.\r\n  Reinecker Company (German), machinery, tools.\r\n  Hurst-Nelson Company (British), railway equipment.\r\n  Glasgow Rolling Stock Company.\r\n  Mellowes & Co.

(British), cranes.\r\n  Herring, Hall, Marvin (American), safes.\r\n\r\nThe Mutual Life Insurance Company, of New York, opened a branch in\r\nHongkong in 1903, but it was closed in 1904, insurance companies\r\npreferring, as a rule, to act through general commission houses at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nForeign firms advertise in Chinese almanacs, which circulate in immense\r\nnumbers throughout the land. An example is _Hallock’s Miscellany_,\r\nprinted in a scholarly manner by the American Presbyterian Mission\r\nPress, 18 Peking Road, Shanghai. The Chinese editions of the Hongkong\r\nand Shanghai papers are excellent mediums, if one is not on the ground.\r\nChinese travelers arrive at a station hours before the departure of\r\na train, and foreign firms find it advantageous to display their\r\ncartoons and advertising in Chinese at railway stations. Even if some\r\nof the Chinese can not read, they become familiar with the “chop” or\r\ncartoon, which accordingly is more important than in any land, and\r\nshould therefore be registered with the foreign consul and the Chinese\r\ntaotai. The Asiatic Petroleum Company, of London, (Dutch-British),\r\nuses a cartoon of three square oil tins, with a tin lamp flaming on\r\nthe top. The Standard Oil Company uses a picture of the hand lamp and\r\nsome paraffin candles. Scott’s Emulsion Company shows the familiar\r\ncodfish on the back of the man. Green Island Cement Company shows\r\nthe famous mountain island of Macao’s inner harbor, with the cement\r\nchimneys at its foot. Barnard & Leas Company, of Moline, Illinois, use\r\na picture of their grain sifter. Mousin et Cie, of Frankfort on Main,\r\nuse a picture of a rose spray and a Chinese man and woman. The New\r\nHome Sewing-Machines use a picture of the machine and a greyhound. The\r\nVictor Talking Machines show the well-known fox-terrier listening to\r\n“His Master’s Voice”. Many of the firms draw attention by quoting an\r\nepigrammatic gem of Chinese wisdom. The Singer Sewing-Machine insists\r\nthat the Chinese shall become familiar with the English letters and\r\nnot the Chinese letters in the bridge of their machine, and they have\r\nhad wide success. The Wheeler & Wilson Sewing-Machine Company shows\r\nGabriel blowing his horn, or the spirit of reform telling China to wake\r\nup! The Longines Watch Company, of Paris, uses a Chinese lily in a\r\nvase and a winged hour-glass. The Chinese are becoming large buyers of\r\ntime-keepers, and these trade-marks are most important. Several suits\r\nover trade-marks on watches have appeared in the courts of Hongkong.\r\nThe Taussig Soap Company, of Vienna, uses a man-headed bird, which\r\nappeals to the humorous Chinese, whose hobgoblins are legion.\r\n\r\nThe get-equipped-quick advertising correspondence schools are\r\nteaching advertising pupils in America to change their advertisements\r\nconstantly. This will not do in China. Nothing pays like a known\r\n“chop”, rigidly adhered to for decades. The Chinese will have nothing\r\nelse than their favorite cartoon, or “chop” on cotton bolt, flour\r\nbag and everything else. “Once a customer always a customer” is truer\r\nin China than anywhere else in the world, but it is harder there than\r\nanywhere else to get that customer the necessary “once”, as he has\r\nprobably linked up with a “chop” that preceded yours. The Harrison\r\nKnitting Machine Company, of Manchester, England, merely show cuts of\r\ntheir machines, and a competitor could do the same, and thus confuse\r\nthe Chinese. Staedtler, the pencil manufacturer of Nuremberg, shows the\r\nman in the moon and a cock. J. H. Birch, of Library Street, Burlington,\r\nNew Jersey, shows merely cuts of his rickshaws, which compete with the\r\nJapanese vehicle. The whisky houses of Britain cease neither day nor\r\nnight in the attempt to give China something Occidental to take the\r\nplace of the debarred opium. They try to adopt different shaped bottles\r\nto distinguish their goods, and some double bottles are now blown\r\nalmost in the shape of the whisky’s “W”. The Burnese Alps Milk Company,\r\nof Stalden, has adopted a mother Teddy bear, giving a baby bear forced\r\nlactary injections. Nestle’s Milk Company, of Vevay, shows the “cow\r\nthat jumped over the moon”. Aquarius Water Company shows a Chinese boy\r\nbearing a tray with the aerated water. Pathe’s French Films show the\r\ncrowing cock. The United States Steel Products Export Company use the\r\ncrouching tiger. Swift’s Hams show “S” in a diamond. Clarke’s Manila\r\nCoffee uses a volcano of coffee beans in imitation of Mayon volcano in\r\nthe Philippines. The Chee Hsin Cement Company, of Tangshan, Pechili\r\nprovince, has a pony whose fiery breath has set the sun on fire. This\r\nis the weird mythological style of “chop” with which the poetical\r\nChinese are familiar and which they like.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese are a race who have nearly as much imagination as the\r\nGreeks. The Hupeh Cement Works, of Tayeh, use a seventeen-storied\r\npagoda, which is supposed to represent a very fine product, as pagodas\r\ntower only thirteen stories at the highest. The Indo-China Cement\r\nCompany uses the well-known dragon of the Manchus, which tosses three\r\nmedals in the air. The British-American Tobacco Company advertises a\r\nnautch girl pulling portiéres apart, a “chop” which is a little more\r\nluxuriously Mohammedan than staid China cares for. Veluvine Protective\r\nPaint has adopted a crouching bulldog. Isuan Aerated Waters, of the\r\nPhilippines, use a hand pouring a bottle that fills a glass. The Toyo\r\nKisen Kaisha uses a red circle in a white fan on a blue flag. Flags are\r\nbecoming popular chops. Shields are also used by the British and the\r\nSpanish, but they are rather intricate for the Chinese to understand.\r\nThere is not much competition yet, and most of the foreign firms, in\r\ntheir desire to educate the Chinese, are merely using photographs of\r\ntheir machinery and product, but as soon as John Chinaman has to choose\r\nbetween two dynamos, two gas engines, two pumps, etc., each of them\r\nmust use a “chop” or trade-mark, just as the oil, the flour, the ham,\r\nthe cement bag, the bolt of cotton, etc., have now to be chopped to\r\nmaintain their position on the slogan popular throughout Canada and\r\nBritain of “what we have we hold.”\r\n\r\nThe treaty ports of China, such as Shanghai, Tientsin, Hongkong, etc.,\r\nshow that almost every form of business is incorporated. Doctors and\r\ndentists form companies, and bring out juniors under indenture. The\r\nshare list shows active trading in the following companies among\r\nothers: railway, steamship, rubber, banks; marine, life and fire\r\ninsurance; oil, refineries, sugar, mining, engineering and contracting,\r\nship-building, car building; docks, wharves and warehouse (godown);\r\nlands, hotels, clubs, buildings, cotton mills and plantations, cement,\r\npower, light, water, trams, millinery, telephone, telegraph, cable,\r\ntailors, dairy farm, abattoir, soda water, distilleries, flour mills,\r\niron mills, gas, electricity, druggist, newspaper, booksellers,\r\nconservancy, athletic clubs, race course, import and export firms,\r\njewelers, silk filatures, tea farms, matting factories and plantations,\r\nfurniture factories, etc. I know of no place where the craze of men\r\nto get rich faster than savings will accumulate is indicated more\r\nthan at Shanghai, Hongkong and Singapore. The bund of Shanghai is as\r\nspeculatively feverous as Wall Street.\r\n\r\nBritish Hongkong, like China, holds that all land is crown or state\r\nland, and therefore leases are granted instead of fee-simple deeds,\r\nAmerican style. The British government has gone extensively into the\r\nland business at Hongkong, leveling many terraces, filling many valleys\r\nin the mountains, and reclaiming from the sea vast areas at West Point\r\nand East Point, Hongkong, and at Yaumati, Kowloon and Hunghom on\r\nthe mainland section of the hilly colony. Leases for these valuable\r\nsites are then put up at auction, bringing about twice the rental\r\nthat obtains in Brooklyn or Jersey City, or the outlying districts\r\nof London. In the same way the foreign concession municipalities of\r\nShanghai, Tientsin, Fuchau, Amoy, Hankau, Newchwang, Harbin, etc.,\r\nprepare land for long leases. These will in time all be strenuous\r\nquestions with the new republican government of China. When the\r\nforeigner gave up the extraterritorial right in Japan, the Japanese\r\nnever again permitted him to own land, unless he became a Japanese\r\ncitizen. Many land companies, subletting long leaseholds, have been\r\nformed in all the treaty ports where there are foreign concessions.\r\nI do not believe that republican China desires to acquire these\r\nleaseholds for many years, and if she did she would purchase them. The\r\nforeign navies would see to that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nRAILWAYS IN CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the third book of _Paradise Lost_, Milton humorously discussed\r\ntransportation in China as follows:\r\n\r\n                        “On the barren plains\r\n  Of Sericana, where Chineses drive\r\n  With sails and wind their cany waggons light,”\r\n\r\nbut the matter has now reached a development worthy of being discussed\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\nChina had in 1912 about 5,500 miles of railway in operation, new main\r\nlines having been built from Tientsin to Nanking (Pukow) by German\r\nand British contractors, and from Nanking to Shanghai by British\r\ncontractors, so that it is now possible to take cars at Shanghai and\r\ngo through to Calais, France, by rail. Branch lines connect the German\r\ncolony of Kiaochou and Chifu with this Tientsin trunk railway, so\r\nthat a German may go straight through from his Crown colony in cars\r\nto Berlin. Before long, when the Canton-Hankau section is completed,\r\nHongkong’s colonial secretary will be able to leave Government House,\r\nfacing the wonderful Botanical Garden on the hill of Hongkong, take\r\na chair down to the Star Ferry Wharf, cross the mile of harbor, then\r\ntake his railway carriage and be whisked through to Downing Street,\r\nLondon, to take his orders from the secretary of state for the Crown\r\ncolonies, with only one ferriage, that from Calais to Dover. Not only\r\na northern railway route is available, but a southern railway route\r\nwill soon be open. When the easy section through Persia, and the short\r\nrailway from Yunnan City through Mung Ting pass connects with Mandalay,\r\nit will be possible for the colonial secretary of Indo-China to leave\r\nthe palatial Palais at Hanoi and entrain at the Tonquin Railway Gare\r\non the palm-lined boulevard, going straight through to the Ministré\r\non the Quai d’Orsay, Paris, via Hyderabad, Teheran, Constantinople\r\nand the Gates of the Danube, all the way without seeing salt water.\r\nLikewise the governor of Singapore will soon be able to entrain\r\nopposite Government House for Calais and London, and cross the teeming\r\ncontinents, passing through the site of the Garden of Eden, on his\r\nway to Downing Street to consult with his chief. He can also pick up\r\nhis traveled friend (since the _entente cordiale_), the Gouverneur at\r\nL’Hotel du Gouverneur, Saigon, and drop him at the Gare du Nord, Paris,\r\non his way to the departments on the left bank of the Seine.\r\n\r\nThe Shanghai-Hangchow-Ningpo railway, built by the British and Chinese\r\nCorporation, and by the Chinese themselves, will soon be completed. The\r\nPeking-Kalgan railway (the route for the tombs of the Ming emperors)\r\nhas been finely built by China’s leading engineer, Jeme Tien Yao\r\n(educated at Yale, 1883) and this road will some day, with Russian and\r\nFrench help, break across Gobi Desert to Kaikhta and Irkutsk, flanking\r\ntwo thousand miles of Manchurian railway, and saving all that distance\r\nin reaching Europe from Shanghai. The Kaifong-Singan railway will\r\nsoon be ready. It is planned to open a new port at Haochow, where the\r\nYellow River (Hoang Ho) used to meet the Yellow Sea, and to run the\r\nrailway through to Kaifong, Singan, Lanchow (in Kansu province) and on\r\nto the historic Tarim valley, and Kashgar, opening up Turkestan. It\r\nis also proposed to open a new port at ice-free Hunshan on the Ginmen\r\nRiver, D’Anville Gulf, Sea of Japan, where China owns a narrow neck of\r\nland running between Northern Korea and the Vladivostok district of\r\nSiberia. From Hunshan a road would be run to Kirin, two hundred miles\r\nover difficult forest-covered country. From Kirin China has independent\r\nlines running between the Russian and Japanese lines. Hunshan would be\r\nan excellent port whence to attack commercially the two rich northern\r\nprovinces of Manchuria. The road planned by America from Chin Wang Tao\r\nto Tsitsikar and Aigun is possibly more of a postponed than a dead road\r\ndespite Russia and Japan.\r\n\r\nThe roads from Hankau north to Mukden have paid heavy dividends and\r\nhelped the imperial exchequer during the revolution of 1911. These\r\nroads have been hindered neither by difficult construction, nor by\r\nobstacles to traffic such as the likin tax system, which has cursed the\r\nfree trade and transportation of the southern part of the country. The\r\nHanyang iron mills can supply rails at one-third the American cost,\r\nviz., nine dollars as compared with twenty-eight dollars per ton, so\r\nthat China can afford to build four miles of railway to America’s one\r\nmile, and reduce rates accordingly because of the lower capital cost.\r\nThe cars can be erected at Hongkong in the south, Hankau in the center,\r\nand at Tongshan in the north of China. The locomotives and trucks\r\nwill be imported from America, Germany and England. The necessary\r\ncoast railway from Hongkong to Ningpo has only been constructed in\r\nthe neighborhood of Amoy. Something has been done on the railways\r\nfrom Hongkong to Yunnan City, and from Hongkong to Chungking, and\r\nfrom Yunnan to Chungking. American engineers have made the surveys.\r\nThe railway along the ancient Ta Peh Lu (Great North Road) post road\r\nfrom Chingtu to Singan has not yet been begun. A road, too, will break\r\nacross west from Chingtu to the Tibet gateway at Tachien. Mention\r\nshould be made of the railway from Kidalova, following the north bank\r\nof the Amur to Blagovestchensk and Khabarovka, which Russia is building\r\nso as to have an all-Russian railway to Vladivostok. This railway\r\nis under way, although the debt of the Russo-Japan War has almost\r\ndestroyed Russian railway building, and postponed Russia’s commercial\r\n(and other?) attack in India’s direction. Had it not been for that\r\ndebt, Russia might to-day be striking for railway entrance to Peking,\r\nto Hankau, to Herat and Constantinople, as so many of the British\r\nimperialists like Kipling and Sir Gilbert Parker fear.\r\n\r\nHongkong has at last beat out Shanghai for the trade of the great\r\nwestern provinces of China. Transshipment is made at Hongkong for\r\nHaiphong, where the new French railway takes merchandise five hundred\r\nmiles northwest to Yunnan as a distributing center. Hongkong also has\r\nthe West (Si Kiang), Yu, Hong Chu, Eta and Peh Rivers as arteries into\r\nthe west. Until two hundred miles of Yangtze gorges and rapids are\r\nflanked by a railway, Shanghai must lose more and more of the vast\r\nwestern trade which she used to control before the French railway\r\nwas built. The French finished in 1910 this remarkable railway from\r\nHaiphong to Yunnan, five hundred miles, and have thus beat out the\r\nBritish, who, because of Colquhoun’s books, were approaching Yunnan\r\nfrom three points in Burma. This railway attack on Yunnan has been\r\na battle of two imperial minds of the Kipling imperialistic type,\r\nColquhoun and Doumer. Colquhoun, the British governor and author, began\r\nurging the construction of British railways in 1881, and followed\r\nup his arguments with a further book in 1898. In 1897, the famous\r\nPaul Doumer, once a printer, went to French China as governor. In\r\n1898 he began his railway to Yunnan. The line, though narrow gage,\r\nhas cost $50,000 a mile, even with cheap Oriental labor. Near the\r\ncoast of Tonquin the country is that of flat rice fields and only\r\nrequires trestling and banking. From Hung Hoa (Bed River) to Lao Kai no\r\nfewer than 180 bridges had to be erected (a fine contract for French\r\nstructural firms) to cross the wild broken country of stream, marsh,\r\ngorge and mountain pass. The line rises from sea level to a pass of\r\n5,000 feet altitude. Much of the Yunnan tin and other exports, which,\r\nby pack saddle and shoulder load, formerly went down to Nanning and\r\ntook the Yu and Si Rivers to Hongkong, are now diverted to Haiphong,\r\nfrom which port the French run branch ship lines to Hongkong and\r\nSaigon, connecting with the great subsidized Messageries Maritimes line\r\nto Marseilles. The French need subsidies because the foreign trade\r\nwhich their bankers control is not so heavy as is that of Britain and\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe Hongkong and Canton Railway, 106 miles, has been completed and\r\nmarks a new lease of life for Hongkong as the emporium of South, West\r\nand Central China, when the railways from Canton are extended. The\r\nHongkong Railway starts from Kowloon, across the narrow harbor, running\r\nthrough 19 miles of British territory, and the remainder through\r\nChinese territory. The British section, on account of the many tunnels\r\nthrough mountains, cost almost as much as the entire Chinese section.\r\nThe fine steamers of the Hongkong and Canton Steamboat Company, which\r\nare well known to world tourists, and many Chinese steamers and junks\r\ncompete, but there is traffic for all, and when there isn’t there will\r\nbe pooling for all. The Hongkong government, through the Hongkong and\r\nShanghai Banking Corporation, loaned the Kwangtung province government\r\nthe money for the Chinese section. (This is an illustration of a few\r\nloans which have not been made to the national government at Peking,\r\nand represents provincial as against the nationalized trunk railway\r\nscheme which helped to bring on the revolution.) The road runs through\r\na part of the country requiring much trestle work, and bridging on\r\naccount of waterways. The long Chinese section of the road cost less\r\nwith one exception than any standard gage railway in the world, $35,000\r\nper mile, the nearest approach to this in America being sections\r\nof the Great Northern Railway built years ago at $40,000 per mile.\r\nNearly all the freight and passenger cars were made at Hongkong. The\r\nbest built railway in China is the Shanghai-Nanking. In easy country\r\nit cost $55,000 per mile. It was built by British contractors on the\r\nelaborate, permanent English plan, whose maxim is, “a stitch in time\r\nsaves nine”. What spoiled the Chinese in hiring foreign contractors was\r\ntheir experience with a section of the Shanghai-Hangchow railway. The\r\nKiangsu and Chekiang provincial governments, hiring native contractors\r\nand engineers (who were trained in America) built a satisfactory\r\nroad of 125 miles at $25,000 per mile, as compared with the British\r\ncontinuation north, of $55,000 per mile. The Chinese have never\r\nceased talking of this economy, although they admit that the English\r\nroad is better and worth $35,000 per mile, but not $55,000. Another\r\nobjection they make is that foreign syndicates charge five per cent.\r\ncommission on their purchases. In the railway from Pukow (opposite\r\nNanking) to Tientsin, the foreign syndicate was not allowed commission\r\non purchases, so that the “Pukow plan” is favored. In reference to the\r\nlow cost, $35,000 per mile, of the difficult Peking-Kalgan railway,\r\n140 miles, which was built by the Chinese exclusively, the _Chinese\r\nStudents’ Journal_ says: “In the construction of the railway, economy,\r\nwhich must not be confounded with cheapness, must always be kept in\r\nview. All railways built in China must be paid for by our people,\r\nand our people are poor. A railway is not a club-house on which to\r\nexpend millions. The redemption of bonds must not be forgotten for a\r\nmoment. On the Peking-Kalgan railway there was no temptation to spend\r\nmoney recklessly, as no five per cent. commission was needed to enrich\r\nthe coffers of the foreign corporation. There were no foreign style\r\nresidences, cement tennis-courts, ice machines, palatial house-boats,\r\nand princely salaries; no interpreters to make a fortune (_i. e._,\r\ncompradores); no graft. There were no unpleasantnesses through the\r\ninterference of foreign consuls, and no reference of insignificant\r\nincidents to ministers at Peking.”\r\n\r\nThe Siberian Railway cost $150,000 a mile through flat country, but\r\n$100,000 of that amount was for nepotism, graft, bureaucracy, boodle\r\nand sweet Roederer champagne.\r\n\r\nThe revolution and the argument over the nationalization of railways of\r\ncourse delayed the great Gorge Railway which runs from Ichang to Wan\r\nHsien on the Yangtze, thus surmounting the almost impassable rapids\r\nof the gorges, which heretofore have split populous Szechuen province\r\nfrom Hupeh. It would be hard to say how many books have been written\r\nabout these difficult rapids and the sublime scenery. The most notable\r\nare by Archibald Little, the trade pioneer of the Yangtze, and then\r\nthere are interesting works by Dingle, Geil, Mrs. Kemp, Mr. Bird,\r\nMr. Blakiston, Mr. Hart and Mrs. Bishop. The road could not possibly\r\nparallel the river along the parapets of the gorges. It breaks inland\r\nthrough great tunnels, some 6,000 feet long. This gorge railway was the\r\nmost necessary in the whole world; it should have been the first begun\r\nin China. When it is running, however, the finest scenery in the world\r\nwill be shut out from the wondering eyes of man, as the famous gorge\r\nboatmen and trackers will give up their work, and, as it is, many of\r\nthem have been killed in the recent war of the revolution, Szechuen\r\nand Hupeh provinces being the first to recruit armies. From Wan Hsien\r\nrailways will go across country to Chingtu, and up the Yangtze to\r\nChungking, thus linking the great west with India, French China and the\r\npopulous eastern and northern provinces.\r\n\r\nGeneral Kuroki’s military railway from Antung to Mukden has now been\r\nturned into a standard-gage road, and a bridge has been thrown across\r\nthe Yalu River (famous for its great naval engagement) to Wiju. It is\r\nnow possible to take a sleeping-car from Tokio to Shinonoseki, cross\r\nthe strait by ferry, take another sleeper at Fusan, and go all the way\r\nthrough Mukden to Kuang Chang Tsu, connecting there with the Russian\r\nline for Moscow and St. Petersburg. For fast service, however, the\r\nRussians are able to favor the all-Russian line to Vladivostok, whence\r\nsteamers can be taken for Hakodate, etc. Passengers from Shanghai can\r\ntake two routes, one by steamer to Dalny, and thence via the South\r\nManchurian (Japanese) railway, or via Tientsin, Newchang, etc. (Chinese\r\nrailways). The Korean-Yalu route, however, is infinitely the more\r\nscenic. Most of the bridges of this route were brought from America.\r\n\r\nThe German railway of 271 miles in Shangtung province shows the\r\neffects of the iron hand in paying small wages, the working expenses\r\nin 1910 being only thirty-five per cent. of the gross earnings. The\r\ngross earnings were $8,000 a mile. In a bare country, where mining\r\nis undeveloped, the average receipts were only seventy-one cents per\r\npassenger mile, and ninety cents per ton mile. Over 90 per cent. of the\r\ntraffic is third class. The average mixed trainload is 150 tons of\r\nfreight and sixty passengers. The famous beans, straw braid, grain and\r\npetroleum predominated in the traffic, but in 1912 coal was beginning\r\nto be a growing factor. The German railway in Shangtung province has\r\nset the example of planting trees. It was copied by the Pennsylvania\r\nrailway. Nearly all the railways of China are copying the reforestation\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nAt Tongshan, eighty miles northeast of Tientsin, are the modern shops,\r\nengineering college and town of the national railways of North China.\r\nHere the first Chinese locomotive, the “Rocket”, was built in stealth\r\nby the British mechanical, railway and mining engineer, Mr. C. W.\r\nKinder, who has done so much for the railways and mines of North China.\r\nThe college turns out railway engineers, and some of the instructors\r\nare American, like Mr. F. A. Foster. Other lecturers are British, like\r\nMr. Kinder and Mr. Pope.\r\n\r\nRailway cars can now be built in the Tongshan shops, the Hanyang works,\r\nthe Shanghai works and the Kowloon (Hongkong) works, as well as at\r\nDalny. The Tongshan works can and have built locomotives.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 the Department of Communications established at Peking a\r\nrailway school. Three hundred of the six hundred students were under\r\ntwenty-five years of age. There were eight foreign and thirty-five\r\nforeign-trained Chinese teachers. The course was three years. English,\r\nmainly, and French, German and Chinese were taught. There is no\r\nmilitary drill, and the curriculum includes history, economics, railway\r\nbookkeeping and law, engineering, management of traffic, shops and\r\nstations, physics, chemistry, drawing, mathematics, geography, etc.\r\n\r\nElectric tramways have been established at Peking, Tientsin, Shanghai,\r\nCanton and the Manchurian cities, the example having been taken\r\nfrom Hongkong’s tramway, built in 1905. Recent photographs show the\r\nremarkable change in the bunds and roads of the treaty ports, where the\r\nautomobile, electric car, rickshaw, wheelbarrow, chair and litter all\r\nhave their fight for the passenger and his nimble coin.\r\n\r\nOn new lines it is necessary to use blue instead of white glass in the\r\ncoaches, as the coolies in their excitement over the scenery forget\r\nand put their heads through the white glass, to which they are not\r\naccustomed.\r\n\r\nThe old system of transportation has not altogether departed, and even\r\nif it had, its memory would linger long. Neither the Peking cart, nor\r\nthe mule litter of Shansi, in which one rides between two tandem mules,\r\nis on springs. They are padded so that the passenger, who is not made\r\nof rubber, may be somewhat protected. If the conveyances were not\r\npadded, only a man dressed up for American football could survive the\r\njolting. These are the vehicles in which dignified (on other occasions)\r\nambassadors have ridden at Peking in all the years since foreigners\r\nwere granted the legation privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nSHIPPING AND WATER ROUTES IN CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe larger steamship lines now supplying the China ports are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                AMERICAN\r\n\r\n  Pacific Mail--Trans-Pacific.\r\n  Standard Oil--Trans-Pacific and Suez route.\r\n  Dollar Steamship Company--Trans-Pacific.\r\n  Northern Pacific Railway--Trans-Pacific.\r\n  American and Asiatic--To America via Suez (agency, American; flag,\r\n          British).\r\n  Barber Line--To America via Suez (agency, American; flag, British).\r\n  Shewan, Tomes & Co.--To Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BRITISH\r\n\r\n  Canadian Pacific Railway--Trans-Pacific.\r\n  Peninsular and Oriental--Suez route to Europe, and coastal.\r\n  Ben Line--Suez route to Europe.\r\n  Shire Line--Suez route to Europe.\r\n  Sassoon Line--To India.\r\n  Jardine, Matheson & Co.--To India, coastwise and Philippines.\r\n  Butterfield and Swire--Australia, India, coastwise, etc.\r\n  Gibb, Livingston & Co.--Australia and Africa.\r\n  Blue and White Funnel Lines--Europe, trans-Pacific, coastwise.\r\n  British-India--India, trans-Pacific, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                JAPANESE\r\n\r\n  Toyo Kisen Kaisha--Trans-Pacific to America and South America.\r\n  Nippon Yusen Kaisha--Trans-Pacific, Europe, coastwise and riverine.\r\n  Osaka Shosen Kaisha--Trans-Pacific, coastwise and riverine.\r\n  Nippon Kisen Kaisha--Coastwise.\r\n  Mitsui Bussan Kaisha--Coastwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 GERMAN\r\n\r\n  North German Lloyd--Europe, coastwise and probably trans-Pacific.\r\n  Hamburg-America--Europe, coastwise and probably trans-Pacific.\r\n  Hansa Steamship Company--Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                AUSTRIAN\r\n\r\n  Austrian Lloyd--Europe and coastwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHINESE\r\n\r\n  China Merchants’ Steamship Company--Coastwise and possibly\r\n          trans-Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          BRITISH AND CHINESE\r\n\r\n  Chinese Engineering and Mining Company--Coastwise and trans-Pacific\r\n          planned.\r\n  Peking Syndicate--Coastwise and trans-Pacific planned.\r\n\r\n                                 FRENCH\r\n\r\n  Messageries Maritimes--Europe, Indo-China and coastwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 RUSSIA\r\n\r\n  Russian Volunteer Fleet--Europe and coastwise.\r\n  Chinese Eastern Railway Steamers--Coastwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 SPAIN\r\n\r\n  Spanish Royal Mail--Europe via Suez.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HOLLAND\r\n\r\n  Shell Transport and Trading--Coastwise and Europe.\r\n\r\nWhen the Panama Canal opens, many more Atlantic lines, such as the\r\nRoyal Mail, International Marine, German lines, etc., will probably\r\nextend their service in time to China, and many trans-Pacific lines,\r\nespecially Japanese and the Pacific Mail, will extend to America’s\r\neastern coast, not to speak of new lines which may be formed. The\r\nBritish-India Steamship Company intends to extend its Calcutta line\r\nacross the Pacific and to New York. The American railroads could, at\r\nsmall cost, by a generous pro rata of division rates, have covered\r\nthe Pacific and Atlantic with American steamship lines, but they have\r\nheld off, expecting the really unnecessary government subsidies. The\r\nsubsidy argument would possibly have a different complexion if it were\r\nassured that the steamship lines would remain forever independent,\r\nand permit no dummy holdings of stock. In the meantime, Japanese and\r\nBritish vessels have been employed on the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans\r\non account of the lower cost of officers’ wages only, the crews’ wages\r\nbeing the same on a Pacific mailer and a Nippon Yusen Kaisha mailer,\r\nfor instance. Both hire Chinese mainly, who are good and cheap\r\nsailors. The American railroad, controlling the west-bound freight, and\r\nthe American banker, controlling the heavier east-bound freight, could\r\nmake American steamship lines on the Pacific profitable; indeed, the\r\nPacific Mail already pays its way. The government could, of course,\r\npay a just amount for mails on an increasing ratio for time made,\r\nbut if the American railroad, American banker, American shipper and\r\nAmerican globe-trotter will come to the aid of the American ship, we\r\ncan, without subsidy, except to independent smaller owners, cover the\r\nPacific with our starry flag.\r\n\r\nAll the large lines are building new ships for the China trade. The\r\nOsaka Shosen Kaisha, running to America in connection with the Chicago,\r\nMilwaukee and St. Paul Railway, has ordered steamships from Armstrong,\r\nin England, and from the Japan shipyards. The Canadian Pacific Railway\r\nSteamship Company and the Pacific Mail are having twenty-knot ships\r\nbuilt. The Hansa Steamship Company, running from Bremen, has ordered\r\nships from the Weser Ship-building Company, of Bremen. The Russian\r\nVolunteer Fleet has ordered new ships from the Alexander-Nevski works.\r\nWireless is to be used generally, the first shore station having\r\nbeen fitted at Hongkong. The Chinese Merchants and the Sino-American\r\ncompanies (both Chinese) intend to run ships to America, as their plans\r\nenlarge. We may yet see the Chinese flag regularly in New York. The\r\nJapanese are to run a line into the Black Sea in competition with the\r\nRussian Volunteer Fleet; they have already sent boats into Trieste in\r\ncompetition with the Austrians, and they have before now humbled the\r\nGermans in the Bangkok-Shanghai service. To show that the Japanese\r\nare not the least timid in declaring their maritime ambitions on the\r\nPacific, I shall quote the following circular signed by Manager Iwanaga\r\nof the subsidized Nippon Yusen Kaisha (the steamship line in which the\r\nMikado is a large shareholder) at the time of the competition with the\r\nlong-established British firm of Butterfield and Swire, a firm which\r\nhad been very friendly to the Japanese during the Russian War. Mr.\r\nIwanaga says: “These foreign firms must be induced to pay respect to\r\nthe Japanese mercantile flag. It is the duty of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha\r\nto check the arrogance of foreign steamers east of Suez.”\r\n\r\nThe history of China’s greatest steamship line, the China Merchants’\r\nSteamship Company, is as follows: When Li Hung Chang was viceroy of\r\nPechili province at Tientsin in 1871, on advice of Americans and\r\nBritish who were in his employ, he formed this government-controlled\r\nline, partly to carry tribute grain from the south; because the Grand\r\nCanal was allowed by the various governors to collect silt, while their\r\npockets collected gilt (and guilt)! Merchants and guilds were invited\r\nor coerced to subscribe to some of the stock. In 1877 the company\r\nbought the Shanghai Steam Navigation Company and its dock for 2,000,000\r\ntaels silver. In 1878 Li diverted from the Grand Canal to the steamship\r\ncompany the Yunnan copper destined to the Peking and provincial mints.\r\nThe great government university at Peking, with provincial branches,\r\ncreated by Kwang Hsu’s reform edicts of 1898, was to be financed\r\npartly by the revenues of this steamship company. The republicans\r\nused its revenues to aid the 1911 revolution because the imperialists\r\nused the railway revenues. The head office of the company is in\r\nShanghai, and it has branches at Newchwang, Chifu, Tientsin, Chinkiang,\r\nKowkiang, Hankau, Ningpo, Fuchau, Hongkong and Canton. The ships are\r\ndistinguishable at the Chinese ports both by the yellow funnel, and\r\nby the immense Chinese characters which, in Austrian fashion, are not\r\nalways borne on the bow, but midships. The fine vessels of this company\r\nwere once put under the American flag in 1884 to save them from the\r\nFrench, who were at war with China.\r\n\r\nOne of the great movements of the future in the reforming Far East\r\nwill be the Malay Peninsular Canal, about fifty miles long, which will\r\nsave 1,500 miles in the voyage from Saigon to Calcutta, Madras, etc.\r\nIt will not cut off and make useless the expensive garrison port of\r\nSingapore, which holds the five equatorial seas for Britain, as the\r\nSingapore-Rangoon railway will run along the entire peninsula. All\r\nthese probabilities in the Far East should be considered in full by the\r\nstudent of world politics, finance, commerce and ethnology. A dozen\r\nChinas, Americas, Britains and Germanies could well work many centuries\r\nbefore the world is restored to the economic Eden state, where each\r\nman will be free, and have enough to support him and his in peace.\r\nEvery work of commerce is then a world-work, claiming the altruist’s\r\nenthusiasm, and while we often use the phrase, “war of the ports of\r\nthe Far East,” we mean that joyful exhibition of strength which the\r\nwrestler, rather than the warrior, puts forth.\r\n\r\nA movement is growing in Japan to deprive foreign ships of the right\r\nto trade between Japanese ports, which is similar to a regulation now\r\nin operation in America and Canada. Japanese vessels, of course, trade\r\nbetween British and China ports. Another plan that is advocated is to\r\nplace on ships not built in Japan such a high duty that Japanese owners\r\nwill be compelled to build in Japan, which would include a personal\r\npenalty if Japanese owners owned steamship stock under a foreign flag.\r\nAll this involves considerable conflict with British interests that\r\nhave loaned immense sums in Japan, and it is certain that the British\r\nforeign office, now so friendly to Japan, will hear from the British\r\nBoard of Trade, as it is hearing every day from the consular service\r\nand such writers as Beresford, Colquhoun and Gilbert Parker.\r\n\r\nWhampoa, the first port in China where Europeans traded, is to be\r\nopened by the Chinese as a treaty port for deep-sea trading. It is\r\nabout six miles below Canton. The port will, of course, compete with\r\nHongkong; but Hongkong opened up a railway to Canton to protect\r\nherself, and she will see that fast and cheap handling maintains her\r\nleadership. The taotai, and Chang Iu Hin who was educated and enriched\r\nat British Singapore, are representative republicans of Canton who are\r\ninterested in Whampoa port. It is proposed to do dredging and make free\r\ngrants of land for godowns, wharves, etc.\r\n\r\nPortuguese Macao, the second port in China where Europeans traded,\r\nforty miles from Hongkong, is dredging her silted harbor preparatory\r\nto bidding for some of the great oversea trade that is expected.\r\nChina, which has ambitions for native ports in the vicinity of Canton,\r\nfrequently sends her warships into Macao waters. The natives of the\r\nMacao district (Heung Shan) do not like Portugal’s ambition, and much\r\nbitterness is shown.\r\n\r\nThe Whang Poo Conservancy Board has deepened the river from Wusung up\r\nto Shanghai, and larger ocean steamers are now able to ascend to the\r\nbund. For a long time the largest vessels must lie at Wusung bar, the\r\n“heaven sent barrier” against foreign intrusion, as the Manchus called\r\nit years ago. The Tientsin Conservancy is deepening the river up from\r\nTaku. Both of these boards are controlled by the foreign settlements,\r\nalthough the Chinese share in the expense. Foreign engineers are hired.\r\n\r\nOther trans-oceanic ports planned by China are at Chin Wang Tao in\r\nPechili province; Hunchun, near Vladivostok on the Japan Sea, and\r\nHaochow, near the junction of Shangtung and Kiangsu provinces. The\r\nBritish may also develop the port of Wei Hai Wei, now that connection\r\nwith the trunk railways of China is in sight.\r\n\r\nFew of the great Chinese ports look after the foreign seamen, but\r\nHongkong has established a sailors’ club and seamen’s institute on a\r\nliberal scale. This idea should be copied along the long yellow coast,\r\nfor the devil’s whisper is loudest and his traps are most numerous in\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Canal as a shipping factor is grand no more, for three\r\nreasons: it has silted up; it has been paralleled by the railway from\r\nHangchow to Peking, 1,000 miles; and it has also been paralleled by the\r\nChina Merchants and other steamship services from Shanghai to Tientsin.\r\nThis once noble work, with its beautiful bridges, pagodas, embankments,\r\nsluices, aqueducts and picturesque junks, passes into history, so far\r\nas its transportation feature is concerned. It may be continued in\r\nparts as an aqueduct, for conservancy purposes in relieving the water\r\npressure on the flood districts of the Whei and Yangtze valleys, or\r\nfor water power for a vast scheme of manufacturing, but that is for\r\nengineers, and not economists, to decide. Marco Polo first made this\r\nfamous work known to the western world. The southern section from\r\nHangchow, the bore city and capital of the Sung dynasty, to the Yangtze\r\nRiver at Chingkiang, was dug about 610 A. D. The oldest, and most\r\nimportant section from a conservancy point of view, from Chinkiang to\r\nthe Whei River, 130 miles, was built about 485 B. C. Kublai Khan is\r\ncredited with being the dreamer of the idea, the digger of the ditch,\r\nthe De Lesseps of China, and the fact is that he built the northern\r\nsection of about 650 miles from the Whei River to Peking in 1289 A. D.\r\nin order to bring the tribute rice and copper of the southern provinces\r\nto Peking. Those who are interested in the canal in its last days of\r\npicturesque use should read the works of Sir John Francis Davis, who\r\nwas governor of Hongkong, and whose experience in China covered the\r\ncrowded years from 1820 to 1846. The American general, J. M. Wilson,\r\nhas also written a book covering his inspection of parts of the canal.\r\n\r\nOn sections of the Yellow River and on the Kia Ling River in Szechuen\r\nprovince, lumber boats are made up to carry produce to market, the\r\nboats being broken up at Chungking. Return freight which can not be\r\ntracked through the rapids is portaged. Although the Yellow River is\r\n2,500 miles long, it is only navigable 150 miles from its mouth to\r\nTsinan City, and in short broken sections in Mongolia and Honan. The\r\nloess silt which it carries, and the porous loess bed through which it\r\nflows, make it only a roaring unmanageable spring and summer drain,\r\nChina’s sorrow of flood and famine. Its memorable changing of bed to\r\nmouths 300 miles apart, from Kiangsu to Shangtung province in 1854, and\r\nfrom banks 100 miles apart in the Gobi Desert, are well known.\r\n\r\nMost of the riverine and coast, junk and sanpan sails are square or\r\noblong, but at Ichang there are strange wupan boats which use the\r\ntowering peaked sails seen on the Arab dahabiyehs of Aden and the\r\nNile, the object being to coax down the high breezes of the difficult\r\ngorges of the Yangtze. This is not the only instance in China of Arab\r\ninfluence in crafts, arts and blood.\r\n\r\nChinese riverine shipping is growing heavily. All flags are seen on\r\nthe Yangtze, and several flags in the lower parts of the Kan and Siang\r\nRivers. The British and Chinese, and some French flags go up the\r\nWest and Yu Rivers to Nanning. Chinese shipping on the Liao River to\r\nNewchwang is heavy in the ice-free season. There are scores of other\r\nrivers which will be dredged so that they may feed the steamship and\r\nrailroad lines.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese have an amusing word for captain. “Lao ta” is literally\r\n“old fellow”; because the captain of the old Yangtze rapids boats was\r\ngenerally the oldest man on board. The captain of the Hakka sanpans of\r\nCanton is often a woman, but she is humorously called “lao ta” with the\r\nrest! China led in all inventions, including woman’s rights!\r\n\r\nIn the coming great development of Western China, the one name to\r\ninscribe on the tablets is that of the pioneer merchant writer,\r\nArchibald Little, who, after twenty years of effort, broke the veil\r\nof the Yangtze gorges and took the first steamer to open up the ports\r\nof Ichang and Chungking in 1898. This brought him within beckoning\r\ndistance of British Burma and Archibald Colquhoun’s propaganda, and\r\nsplit China in two with the wedge of commerce, despite the obstructive\r\nTsung Li Yamen at Manchu Peking. Mr. Little’s three books on Western\r\nChina are: _Through the Yangtze Gorges_, _To Omi Mount in Szechuen_,\r\nand _Across Yunnan_; and he wrote, moreover, a very important\r\ngeological work which places him high as a prospector and explorer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nAMERICA IN CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere the Happy Valley Road branches off, one part leading to the\r\nRoyal Golf Club, and the other to the Mohammedan, Parsee and European\r\ncemeteries, and Wong Nei Chong valley, Hongkong, on a spot where\r\nSecretary William Henry Seward stood in 1869, there is a monument which\r\nhas particular interest for Americans and Britons, and possibly it is\r\na prophecy of their united work in the future in developing China. The\r\nmonument tells its own story of brothers in arms in the dangers of the\r\nFar Eastern seas in lonely days as follows:\r\n\r\n               _Erected by the officers and crews of the\r\n                  United States steam frigate Powhatan\r\n                                  and\r\n                     H. B. M. steam sloop Rattler,\r\n                              in memory of\r\n           their shipmates who fell in a combined attack on a\r\n             fleet of piratical junks off Kuhlan (Kowloon)\r\n                            August 4, 1855.\r\n                         Killed in the action:\r\n                               Powhatan.\r\n                       John Pepper, seaman.\r\n                       James A. Halsey, landsman.\r\n                       Isaac Coe, landsman.\r\n                       S. Mullard, marine.\r\n                       B. F. Addamson, marine._\r\n\r\nThe first American treaty is dated 1844 when Caleb Cushing and Daniel\r\nWebster’s son, Fletcher, went to Hongkong, Canton, Macao, etc.,\r\nbut American trade began at a still earlier date, when the _Empress\r\nof China_, Captain Green, Purser Samuel Shaw, sailed from New York\r\non Washington’s birthday, 1784. The ship _Alliance_ sailed from\r\nPhiladelphia in 1788 without charts. The ship _Massachusetts_ sailed\r\nfrom Boston in 1789, armed with twenty six-pound guns, and half the\r\ncargo being useless furs for the southern Chinese! The old Philadelphia\r\nmerchants interested in the China trade were of the Archer, Girard and\r\nRulon families. The Boston merchants who despatched regular packet\r\nships to Canton were of the Forbes, Perkins, Cabot, Sturgis, Russell,\r\nCushing and Coolidge families. The first American consuls lived at\r\nbeautiful Macao. Major Shaw, purser of the _Empress of China_ was\r\nconsul in 1786, Samuel Snow in 1794, and Edward Carrington in 1804. On\r\nNovember 16, 1856, just before the “Arrow” war, Captain Armstrong, U.\r\nS. S. _Portsmouth_, attacked the Canton (Bogue) forts. This was the\r\nonly time America attacked China, except at Peking in 1900. When all\r\nEurope hesitated to befriend the northern states, China issued this\r\nedict to viceroys in 1863: “Keep a careful and close oversight, and if\r\nthe Confederate steamer _Alabama_, or any other vessel of war, scheming\r\nhow it can injure American property, shall approach that part of the\r\ncoast of China under your jurisdiction, you are to prevent all such\r\nvessels entering our ports.”\r\n\r\nThe American representatives in China were first trade commissioners,\r\nand afterward diplomats, and the tendency now, at least with the\r\nBritish and Germans, is to have both commissioners and diplomats. The\r\nAmerican officials were the following:\r\n\r\nCaleb Cushing, commissioner, 1844 (first treaty).\r\n\r\nAlex. H. Everett, commissioner, 1846 (died, Canton, 1847).\r\n\r\nJohn W. Davis, commissioner, 1847.\r\n\r\nHumphrey Marshall, commissioner, 1852.\r\n\r\nRobert M. McLane, commissioner, 1853.\r\n\r\nDoctor Parker, commissioner, 1856.\r\n\r\nWilliam B. Reed, minister, 1857 (first minister).\r\n\r\nJohn E. Ward, minister, 1859.\r\n\r\nAnson Burlingame, minister, 1861 (remarkably brilliant).\r\n\r\nMr. Low, minister, 1870.\r\n\r\nJ. B. Angell, minister, 1882 (later president University of Michigan).\r\n\r\nCharles Denby, minister, 1885.\r\n\r\nMr. E. H. Conger, minister, 1900.\r\n\r\nW. W. Rockhill, minister, 1905.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun, minister, 1909.\r\n\r\nThe most famous secretary of the American legation was Samuel Wells\r\nWilliams, the author of the _Middle Kingdom_, etc., and editor of the\r\n_Chinese Repository_. His son serves at present in the Peking legation.\r\nIt would take a volume to cover Mr. S. W. Williams’ brilliant work as\r\ninterpreter of missions and legations, printer at Canton and Macao,\r\ntranslator, author, lecturer, secretary, dictionary compiler, professor\r\nat Yale, sinologue, money raiser for the causes of missions and\r\nletters, and diplomat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright, 1913, The Bobbs-Merrill Company.\r\n\r\nNote the use of English signs.

The\r\n    Porta Cerco gate between Portuguese and native China. The treaty\r\n    was signed by Caleb Cushing and Daniel Webster’s son, Fletcher,\r\n    on July 3d, 1844, the tablets on the gate being of a later date,\r\n    and commemorating a Portuguese victory.\r\n]\r\n\r\nDaniel Webster had not a little to do with America’s relations with\r\nChina. He studied the subject deeply. He suggested the first mission\r\nthat secured a treaty, and wrote the president’s message of December\r\n30, 1842, to Congress suggesting the mission. Cushing’s letter of\r\ninstructions was signed by Webster, and showed deep knowledge of\r\nChinese affairs. The treaty was signed in a temple at Wanghai, outside\r\nthe Porta Cerco stone gate at Macao; and I would recommend the\r\npilgrimage to the many tourists who visit the picturesque settlement in\r\nSouth China.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 an American, Frederick G. Ward, formed the nucleus of the\r\nManchu imperialist army which finally overcame the Taiping rebels.\r\nAnother American took service with Li Hung Chang as secretary. His\r\nname was W. N. Pethick. He had served in the Civil War in America. Mr.\r\nPethick had considerable influence with Li, assisting him in treaty\r\nmaking, reading to him reform and economical books, and taking a\r\npart in urging the crusade against opium. Mr. Pethick died from the\r\nhardships of the siege of Peking in 1900.\r\n\r\nWhen John Hay and Philander Knox secured the assent of the nations to\r\nthe American and British doctrine of the non-partition of China, they\r\nwere repeating the “square deal” terms of the famous treaty of 1868,\r\nwhich the brilliant American, Anson Burlingame, on behalf of China,\r\nwhich nation he was then serving as commissioner, secured from America,\r\nstipulating the “territorial integrity of China, and disavowing any\r\nright to interfere with China’s eminent domain”.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 the American troops found a great store of silver at Tientsin,\r\nbut gave it up, as America returned the Boxer indemnity of 1908, and\r\nthe abstention of the American troops from looting in Peking in 1900\r\nset the usual high standard of altruism and soldierly honor which Sun\r\nYat Sen and Wu Ting Fang say China connects with the name America.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 Mrs. Conger and the other ladies of the American legation began\r\nthe work which threw down the zenana bars which held Manchu and Chinese\r\nwomen in repressive exclusiveness.\r\n\r\nYears ago prominent Chinese made some study of American leaders. Seu Ki\r\nYu, governor of Amoy and member of the Tsung Li Yamen (Foreign Board\r\nat Peking) in 1866, to whom Secretary W. H. Seward sent a picture of\r\nWashington, composed the following essay:\r\n\r\n“Washington was a very remarkable man. In advising plans he was more\r\ndaring than our heroes, Chin Shing or Han Kwang. In winning a country\r\nhe was braver than Tsau or Lin Pi. Wielding his four-foot falchion he\r\nenlarged the frontier myriads of miles, and yet he refused to usurp\r\nregal dignity or even to transmit it to his posterity; but, on the\r\ncontrary, first proposed the plan of electing men to office. Where in\r\nthe world can be found a mode more equitable? It is the same idea, in\r\nfact, that has been handed down to us from the three reigns of Yau,\r\nShun and Yu (the immortal reigns of China). In ruling the state he\r\nhonored and fostered good usages, and did not exalt military merit, a\r\nprinciple totally unlike what is found in other kingdoms. I have seen\r\nhis portrait. His mien and countenance are grand and impressing in the\r\nhighest degree. Who is there that does not call him a hero?” This essay\r\nwas reissued by the republicans in 1911 and had a wide influence in\r\ntheir propaganda.\r\n\r\nThe American exports to China, including Hongkong, consisting chiefly\r\nof cotton, machinery, oil, flour and tobacco, were as follows: 1908,\r\n$34,000,000; 1909, $28,000,000; 1910, $23,000,000 (exports to China\r\nfrom all countries, $305,580,000); 1911, $25,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe American imports were, in their order, chiefly silk, tea, hides,\r\nwool, straw braid, pig iron, musk, hair, raw cotton, albumen, bristles,\r\nand amounted as follows: 1908, $24,000,000; 1909, $31,000,000; 1910,\r\n$38,000,000 (exports by China to all countries, $251,460,000); 1911,\r\n$32,000,000.\r\n\r\nThis is but a beginning, as it were, “a little cloud out of the sea,\r\nlike a man’s hand”.\r\n\r\nAmerica should keep stocks in Manila to attack the Chinese market,\r\nwhere “time is of the essence of importance”. This applies to iron,\r\nhardware, tinware, structural beams, cottons, woolens, yarn, shoes,\r\nmachinery, educational and military apparatus, foods, utensils,\r\npipes, and everything necessary in municipal, industrial and domestic\r\ndevelopment. A Cantonese or Shanghai Chinese does not mind the trip\r\nto Manila to inspect, though he would prefer seeing what America has\r\nto offer in Hongkong, Shanghai, Hankau, Tientsin, Mukden, Chingtu and\r\nYunnan, if America shortly concludes to take advantage of these seven\r\nstrategic trade centers. In the meantime full stocks at Manila would\r\nbe a good beginning. Even in disturbed years, such as 1911, America’s\r\nimports from China were $32,000,000, and exports $25,000,000. These\r\nfigures are small compared to those that will soon obtain, and, of\r\ncourse, America desires first to increase her exports of machinery,\r\ndrugs, novelties, utensils, loom products, tools, etc.\r\n\r\nAmerican food and harvester companies will doubtless yet take up land\r\ndirectly or indirectly in fertile Manchuria, where America must look\r\nfor supplies of vegetable oil, wheat, fertilizer, oil cake for milch\r\ncows, lumber and coal, and a market for machinery and manufactures.\r\nThere is a virgin territory seven hundred miles by seven hundred miles,\r\ninviting the agriculturist. The American-Chinese Railway planned in\r\n1910, from Chin Wang Tao, the only ice-free port on the Liaotung Gulf,\r\nto Tsitsikar and on to Aigun on the Amur River, was an excellent scheme\r\nand one which may eventually be accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe Western Electric Company, of America, installed Peking’s telephone\r\nsystem. The American Banknote Company set up China’s central bank\r\nengraving department. American companies furnished the stamping\r\nmachinery for the new mints. American bridges and locomotives are\r\nfrequently seen throughout China. American sewing machines, oil cans\r\nand tobacco papers are on view everywhere throughout the twenty-one\r\nprovinces, and the American flour bag, when empty, patches the sails\r\nof the southern junks. Some American presses have come over, but they\r\ndo not as yet compete strongly with the British and German presses.\r\nAmerican hotel and kitchen utensils would compete were it not that\r\nthe palatial treaty port hotels are controlled as yet by British and\r\nGerman shareholders. American mining, gas, electric, cranes, sawmill,\r\ncement, flourmill and pumping machinery are coming in, excepting where\r\nforeign contractors and bankers interpose. British shipyard machinery\r\nis still ahead. American protective paints for steel are holding their\r\nown in competition with the British and German paints, especially in\r\nthe Yangtze valley. American turbines are slightly ahead, but American\r\npipes, dynamos, stationary engines, winches, heating plants, dredgers,\r\ncondensers, cables, electric fans, bleaching and cotton machinery,\r\nrefrigerating machinery, wood-working machinery, water meters, hauling\r\nplants, lamps, etc., are still behind the British and German article,\r\nthe British trade exceeding the American four to one. American\r\nmachinery, with its generally nicer finish and greater adaptation and\r\nefficiency, has a vast field. In sugar machinery, Japan leads, but\r\nAmerica will pass her. In car wheels, rails, and in simple foundry and\r\nrolling mill output, China can not be competed with for any length\r\nof time. In shovels, ballast unloaders, coal and ore hoists, America\r\nwill lead, as she leads in locomotives. In the immense telegraph\r\ndevelopment, Britain leads. In water-tube boilers, America leads.\r\nIn couplers, roofing, steam hammers and drilling machinery, America\r\nhas a fair chance. In military supplies, Germany and Japan lead. In\r\nmotor-boats, America will lead, although if time is not important, the\r\nChinese dockyards can not be competed with in steam launches, which are\r\nnow used very largely to tow the cargo junks. In automobiles, America\r\nleads. In family hardware, America and Britain lead. In lubricating\r\noils, America meets some competition from the Dutch and Russians, but\r\nin illuminating oils, America leads. In fuel oils, the Dutch probably\r\nlead at present, the Shell Company having tanks of Sumatra oil at the\r\nports. One of them was dramatically punctured with a shell in the\r\nrecent revolution. In brakes, Britain and America share the field. In\r\nelevators, America will win. In reinforcing steel, America will lead.\r\nIn typewriters, she long ago won the field. In sanitary hardware,\r\nscales, safes, rubber goods, America has an excellent chance. In\r\nphonographs, she has won, but in amusement films, France is ahead. In\r\nmilks, Switzerland leads, and France leads in candies. In extensive\r\nsystems of harbor improvements, sewerage, water supply, municipal\r\nimprovements, power and light plants, institutions, mill erecting,\r\netc., America will win as soon as the banking department is attached\r\nto the erecting and contracting department. At present the British\r\nand Germans lead, as they have done in South America, because of the\r\nbanking department being attached to the constructive and diplomatic.\r\nIn sporting goods, drugs, book supplies and school furniture, America\r\nwill soon close up on Britain’s lead. In jewelry and fancy goods,\r\nFrance, Japan, Britain, Germany and America divide the field, in which\r\nthere is a fighting chance, with the Chinese themselves as apt pupils\r\nin the competition. In brewery machinery, Japan and Germany lead. In\r\ncanning equipment, America could easily seize the kingdom, and give the\r\nworld added table necessities and delights from a new realm of sunshine\r\nand warmth. In leather, felt and underwear, America could lead. In\r\nspecial pianos for the moist climate, Britain leads, but she could be\r\noutplayed. In types, America could win. The field is not for war, but\r\ntournament, and the most efficient should and will win the joust! There\r\nare enough events to provide honors and rewards for each and all. Those\r\nnations which have had high tariffs will suffer most at the beginning\r\nof the competition, because while a high tariff may be the mother\r\nof the trusts, it is seldom the mother of a prodigy in competitive\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nAmerica’s and Britain’s recognition of the Chinese republic might\r\nnaturally raise a temporary discontent in the Philippines, India\r\nand Egypt, but in homogeneity and responsibility these patronized\r\npeople can not compare with the Chinese. If it should turn out that\r\nChina, like Russia and Japan, is not yet ready for republican or\r\nconstitutional self-government, much less is the non-fusible muddle\r\nof Viscayan, Tagalog, Ilocano and Moro, in the lovely summer islands;\r\nMohammedan and Bengalese and Copt, Fellahin and Sudanese. Altruism is a\r\nsane creature, walking steadily on two legs, and is not going to lose\r\nits head and permit anarchy anywhere just to humor sentimentalism.\r\nTheodore Roosevelt made this plain in his Guildhall speech at London,\r\nwhich landed Kitchener in Egypt again to finish his work, and it\r\nwould apply as well to-day when certain overanxious Filipinos compare\r\ntheir organization, temperament and constitution with the superior\r\nChinese. America, like Britain, can strike with the same hand with\r\nwhich she shakes hands. The civil service and a host of foreign\r\nschool-teachers in the Philippines and India is the shaking of hands.\r\nLet the Philippines and India appreciate it in that way. It would\r\nbe quite different for them if monarchical Germany, Japan or Russia\r\ncontrolled. We shall recognize the republican trial in China because\r\nwe believe China is homogeneous, educated and patient enough to make\r\nthat trial safely, but neither America nor Britain will for a long\r\ntime yet permit the trial in the Philippines, India or Egypt. If those\r\ncountries ask the Anglo-Saxon why, we have but one answer; “Look at\r\nyour history until we managed your interests, and look at our history.”\r\nIn recognition of Japan’s power, America has dropped her first line\r\nof defense back to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. In a new understanding of\r\nBritain’s oneness with us; of the Philippines linking Australia, India\r\nand Canada; of China’s welcome of our style of government and altruism,\r\nlet us, when we have the docks, move our advance line back to the\r\nPhilippines; for we mean to have as much to say in protecting China as\r\nany other power, which policy does not involve annoying illustrious\r\nJapan. But we are going to be on the ground, for as far as Russia\r\nand Japan and some others are concerned, they have a land-grabbing\r\nappetite and tendency which is not calculated to give China fair\r\nplay in bringing out the great possibilities which are in her, if we\r\nrespect her most majestic history. If the complaint is listened to,\r\nand America and Britain should withdraw, consider the kind of liberty\r\nour successors would deal out: the oligarchic rule of Russia, and the\r\nSatsuma and Choshiu nepotism of Japan.\r\n\r\nJapan, in traditional Oriental style, has been on occasions alert to\r\nplay one nation against another, with the view of gaining an advantage\r\nof slow prodigious China. When the treaty with America was to expire\r\none year ahead of the termination of treaties with other nations,\r\nJapan extended the latter treaties one year, so that her treaties\r\nwith all the powers might expire together. The obnoxious emigration\r\nclause in all these treaties would mainly be taken advantage of,\r\nhowever, in America’s case, and we should have, if the treaty was\r\ninsisted on by a sudden opposition which gained power, the constant\r\nstrife of the Japanese labor question in Hawaii, the Philippines and\r\nthe Pacific coast states, which strife served the deep purpose that\r\nAmerica, being technically in the wrong, might neglect to press Japan\r\non greater matters where Japan was taking advantage of treaties, as in\r\nManchuria and Korea. Some of the adroit Japanese statesmen, instead\r\nof being wounded at our attitude, really enjoy it in secret. Certain\r\nJingo Japanese, however, would have liked, with this excuse, to have\r\ntried America’s naval strength on the Pacific in 1908, and attempted\r\nthe capture of Manchuria, Fukien province, the Philippines and Hawaii,\r\nwhich test was probably avoided by the dramatic master stroke in\r\nsending America’s great fleet of battleships across the Pacific as\r\nan object lesson to the Nipponite chauvinist. Japan should for the\r\nfuture be reasonable enough to assent sincerely to an interpretative\r\nemendation of the “most favored nation clause”, so that it will really\r\nmean the “most favored Oriental nation”, as far as the emigration of\r\nlaborers is concerned. This will put Japan on a par with China. America\r\nsends no laborers to Japan; Japan has discharged American professors\r\nin Japan and Korea the very moment the Oriental understudy reported\r\nthat he was ready to assume charge; America has bought from Japan\r\nvastly more than she has sold to her; the timely loans of America to\r\nJapan, as Mr. Jacob H. Schiff has said in his notable speech of 1910,\r\nenabled Japan to continue the war with Russia until victory was won;\r\nAmerican friendship for Japan enabled that nation to secure larger\r\ntreaty stipulations from Russia at Portsmouth than any other host of\r\nthe negotiators would have encouraged, and above all, the tactful\r\nAmerican, Perry, opened up Japan to modernity in 1854. Japan’s vaunted\r\nConfucian and Shinto manners should teach her to protect the blood\r\nof her historic friend in his own house, and to respect the greater\r\nexpense the American laborer nobly goes to in providing, under greater\r\ndifficulties, for the living and education of his family. There should\r\nbe no more emigration to the American mainland or Hawaii of Japanese\r\nlabor than there is of Chinese. Let the Japanese laborers go to Formosa\r\nand Korea, where there are wide enough opportunities and where their\r\nown government, customs and language rule.\r\n\r\nParticularly as America has loaned Japan money, there should be an\r\nunequivocal “open door” policy in Manchuria, where Japan is operating\r\nalready one double-track and one single-track trunk railway, with\r\nbranches, and has intruded many bands of colonizers on old China, which\r\nbands live in settlements where Japan collects taxes against agreement\r\nand in practical contravention of China’s sovereignty. This “open door”\r\npolicy should end the brigandage against foreign traders of directly or\r\nindirectly rebating to Japanese shippers on the monopolistic railway\r\nprivilege to which America never agreed. Cotton and other goods for the\r\nJapanese trade colonies should not be entered free at Dalny as “railway\r\nsupplies”! The Japanese government through the Yokohama Specie Bank\r\nshould not lend at the ridiculous rate of two per cent. to Japanese\r\nimporters and common carriers the money that came largely from America,\r\nif it affects American trade. This is interpreting an “open door”\r\npolicy as it is understood at Tokio and Dalny, not as it is written\r\nat Tokio and Washington. Since generous America buys vastly more from\r\nJapan than she sells to her, Japan should lower her tariff instead\r\nof raising it. Japan wants to raise her tariff to sixty per cent. in\r\nsome cases while we of the august righteous Occident only permit vast\r\ngood-natured China a tariff of five per cent. ad valorem.\r\n\r\nThe railroads of our Pacific coast, controlling the eastern shipments,\r\nshould not invite over Japanese steamship lines, and lay off American\r\nlines as was done with the Boston Steamship Company at Seattle in 1909.\r\nAs it is now, our railroads have made contracts with five Japanese\r\nsteamship lines, so as to force our government, many critics say, to\r\ngrant a ship subsidy, which is unnecessary, as the traffic is great\r\nenough to pay, with a mail payment, the lines on the Pacific running\r\ncheaper than those on the Atlantic on account of the crews being all\r\nChinese. Japanese merchants in Manchuria have petitioned the Japanese\r\ngovernment for state assistance to be given Japanese manufacturers in\r\nManchuria.\r\n\r\nDespite Japan’s and Russia’s rejection of America’s suggestion in 1910,\r\nthere will remain only one course eventually to be taken as the result\r\nof Secretary Hay’s announcement in 1899 of the “open door” policy for\r\nall time in China and Manchuria, and that is for a revivified China to\r\nsecure an international five-nation loan, or preferably a four-nation\r\nloan, to take over from Russia and Japan all the railways held by those\r\ntwo nations in Manchuria, and clean those three provinces of Japanese\r\nand Russian troops and Achranie Straja (railway guards), Manchuria\r\nthereafter acting as a buffer Chinese state between those really\r\nirreconcilable contestants, who under present conditions promise to\r\nthrow the whole world into warlike turmoil every decade. The Japanese\r\nand Russians, by blocking, in 1910, the American railway concession\r\nfrom Chin Wang Tao to Aigun (which America did not intend to occupy\r\nwith troops) really confessed that they considered, since it so suited\r\nthem, that the secret agreement which Russia forced from China in 1899\r\nwas of superior power to the Japan-Russia Treaty made at Portsmouth,\r\nwhich avowed the “open door” policy. Britain, under pressure from\r\nRussia, agreed in 1899 that the former was not to interfere north of\r\nPeking, and the latter agreed not to interfere in the Yangtze valley\r\n(as though she ever could!). In that same year John Hay secured the\r\nassent of the nations, including Russia and Britain, to the policies\r\nfor all time of the “non-partition of China” and the “open door”, which\r\npolicies were confirmed by the Portsmouth Treaty, and therefore Japan\r\nand Russia, in blocking the Chin Wang to Aigun railway, Chin Wang to\r\nKailar, or any other northern or Manchurian railway, were acting _ultra\r\nvires_, and negotiations in the interest of China, and the development\r\nof America’s trade, might well come up again. Certainly the South\r\nManchurian railway has all the traffic it can handle, and it can no\r\nmore serve great Manchuria and Eastern Mongolia than could a railway\r\nconfined to Florida serve the eastern and central states as far north\r\nas Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nHad this Chin Wang to Aigun railway been laid, besides the vast\r\ngrazing, agricultural, mineral, lumber and mining territory which\r\nwould have been developed, several important centers would have been\r\nmade known to the world. Hulutao and Chin Wang are new ports which are\r\nice free longer than Newchang, which should be made the advance post,\r\ninstead of Shanghai, seven hundred miles away, for America’s attack on\r\nthe rich Manchurian trade. Some day we shall run steamers across the\r\nPacific to Hulutao and Chin Wang, and thus be independent of Japan’s\r\nport of Dalny. Tsitsikar on the Nonni River is a great stock, lumber,\r\nmining and railroad center. Aigun, on the great Amur River, is the\r\nproposed northern terminus of this seven hundred and fifty miles of\r\nrailway. Up to 1900 Aigun was the largest city in Manchuria, but during\r\nthe Boxer troubles Russian troops in revenge razed it to the ground.\r\nHere, in May, 1858, was signed the famous Chinese treaty with Russia,\r\ndelimiting the present bounds of Manchuria. Aigun is a most important\r\nfur, lumber, agricultural, flour, gold and general mining center, and\r\nhas all the great Amur, Sungari and Shilka Rivers to draw cargoes to\r\nits docks.\r\n\r\nAcross the Amur River on Siberian soil (I can hear George Kennan\r\nrevive his reminiscences) lies Blagovestchensk. This city was the\r\nscene, in 1900, of one of the most cruel massacres of the ages, which\r\nshould reveal fully to the world the real heart of the oligarchal\r\nRussian army and government with which we have had to deal, afar off\r\nas yet. Thousands of unarmed Chinese shopkeepers and gold miners\r\n(who had absolutely nothing to do with Boxerism one thousand miles\r\naway) were led to the riverside, and at the word of command from\r\nGeneral Chitchegoff the Russian troops at the point of the bayonet\r\ndrove the innocent victims into the swift Amur, where many were\r\ndrowned. Blagovestchensk is a thriving modern city. It is the center\r\nof the opulent Siberian gold industry, and has many live American\r\nadvance agents who would welcome the American railway by a bridge\r\nover from Aigun! It is lighted by electric light, has clubs, hotels,\r\nlibraries, docks, river steamers when the river is open (!), theaters,\r\ncolleges, factories, flour and sawmills, splendid churches, fine brick\r\nresidences, roads and horses.\r\n\r\nBesides its exceedingly rich mines, Manchuria produces in the south,\r\noak-leaf silk which we in America call Shangtung because it is like the\r\nsilk of Shangtung, which was the first known of the wild silks; cotton,\r\njade, maize, barley, pulse, the very valuable soy-bean, wheat, oats,\r\nthe very valuable kaoliang (tall millet), the grain of which produces\r\nspirits and the stalk of which produces paper; hsiao mi (short millet),\r\npoppy, polygonum, used for blue dye; castor oil bean, sesamum, ginseng,\r\npaper spruce, fine fruit and flowers, salt, bean oil, famous vermicelli\r\nfrom loutou beans, the best tobacco produced in China, hemp (abutilon\r\navicennæ), true hemp, charcoal, peas, fine reed matting, indigo, etc.\r\nNorthern Manchuria, besides much of the foregoing, produces the famous\r\nblack pigs of Kirin; soda bricks, cattle, leather, bear and deer skins;\r\na vast amount of the world’s finest furs, including squirrels, tiger\r\nand dog skins, which last are produced on dog farms largely for the\r\nAmerican market; gray bricks, tamara salmon, sturgeon, etc. The land\r\nis a future granary to feed the manufacturing hundreds of millions\r\nin America, who, despite intensive farming, will have exhausted the\r\nnatural productiveness of their country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE NATIVE LEADERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the revolution chapter of this book we have given many names of the\r\nnew leaders. Others who have attained prominence are the following.\r\nMost of them have seen foreign service, or been educated in America,\r\nBritain, Germany or Japan. In March, 1912, a descendant of the Ming\r\nemperors came forward at Peking to add to the complexity of the\r\nsituation. He endeavored to obtain the allegiance of Yuan’s rebelling\r\nnorthern troops, who seemed loyal to no cause or person. He was the\r\nso-called “Marquis” Chu Cheng Yu. A Ming claimant would more naturally\r\nmake his appeal at the old Ming capital, Nanking, but Nanking was now\r\nall for the republic.\r\n\r\nTang Shao Yi, Yuan’s assistant, educated in America, visited America on\r\nmany commissions; a superior man, worthy of special mark in the coming\r\nChina; Yuan’s representative at the Shanghai peace conferences.\r\n\r\nYen Shih Si and Yang Shih Chi, assistants of Tang at the Shanghai peace\r\nconferences; Board of Finance and Railways, Peking, 1911.\r\n\r\nM. Y.

The “most\r\nfavored nation” clause admits nations which did not participate in the\r\noriginal treaty.\r\n\r\n    1842. Nanking Treaty--Nanking, Canton, Amoy, Fuchau, Ningpo and\r\n    Shanghai opened.\r\n\r\n    1858. Tientsin-British--Newchwang, Chifu, Swatow, Kiangchow\r\n    opened.\r\n\r\n    1860. Tientsin-French Treaty--Tientsin opened.\r\n\r\n    1861. German Treaty--Chinkiang, Hankau opened.\r\n\r\n    1876. Chifu Convention--Ichang, Wuhu, Wenchow, Pakhoi opened.\r\n\r\n    1881. Russia-China--Russian commercial influence in Ili,\r\n    Mongolia, Manchuria; consulates and extraterritoriality\r\n    provided for.\r\n\r\n    1890. Chungking Convention--Chungking opened.\r\n\r\n    1895. Japan Treaty--Suchow, Hangchow opened.\r\n\r\n    1896. Russia-China Treaty--Russia given railway and other\r\n    privileges in Manchuria; this brought on the war with Japan in\r\n    1904.\r\n\r\n    1897. West River Ports--Samshui, Wuchow, etc., opened.\r\n\r\n    1899. Russia-China--China not to build railways north of Peking\r\n    without Russia’s consent.\r\n\r\n    1902. British Commercial Treaty (Mackay)--Changsha, Ngan-king,\r\n    Wan Hsien, Waichou opened. Likin to be abolished and customs\r\n    possibly raised from five per cent. to twelve per cent. ad\r\n    valorem.\r\n\r\n    1905. Japan-China--Grants to Japan by treaty what war with\r\n    Russia won for Japan; i. e., military, commercial, mining and\r\n    railway dominance in South Manchuria, and Japan to have power\r\n    to nullify Chinese or other foreign railway schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        TREATIES AFFECTING CHINA\r\n\r\n    1899. Britain-Russia--Britain not to interfere with Russia\r\n    north of great wall, and Russia not to interfere in Yangtze\r\n    valley.\r\n\r\n    1899. America to Powers (John Hay’s Note)--“Open door” for all\r\n    in China, and preservation of territorial integrity.\r\n\r\n    1905. Portsmouth Treaty (Russia-Japan)--Japan takes Korea and\r\n    part of Manchuria.\r\n\r\n    1905. Britain-Japan--Alliance and assuring integrity of China.\r\n\r\n    1907. Russia-Japan--Recognize territorial integrity of China.\r\n\r\n    1907. Britain-Russia--Britain to support China in Tibet.\r\n\r\n    1908. America-Japan--Open door in China; integrity of China.\r\n\r\n    1910. America to Powers--Internationalize Manchurian railways;\r\n    rejected by Russia and Japan.\r\n\r\n    1910. Russia-Japan--Secret convention to reject America’s\r\n    financial and commercial plans in Manchuria; Russia and Japan\r\n    to divide Manchuria in spheres of influence and trade.\r\n\r\nThese treaties sound very well, but mean very little, excepting\r\nthis, that if Japan or Russia persistently breaks them and invades\r\nChina, Britain and America have a cause before the world, to thrash,\r\nif it is necessary, the offender’s navy, and cut Japan off from Korea\r\nand Manchuria. The treaties are a confusion. They all specify that\r\nthe “open-door” theory is acknowledged, but Russia and Japan have\r\nforced China to assent to their visé on any proposed railway schemes\r\nin Manchuria and Pechili. Despite the Britain-Japan Treaty of 1905,\r\nwherein the “integrity of China” is specified as a promise to the\r\nnations, the London _Times_ confesses as follows: “The grim facts of\r\nthe economic gravitation of Manchuria toward Russian and Japanese\r\ncontrol are beyond remedy, treaties and agreements notwithstanding.”\r\nYet at one time the thunderer would bring on a war for the sake of\r\na straw! If Russia continues to offend there is no way to stop her\r\nexcept that America and Britain shall send their navies to pound her\r\nBaltic gates until she behaves in Manchuria, Mongolia, etc., which she\r\nsoon would do in fear of her Duma on the inside of the Baltic gates.\r\nBritain never again can use Japan to pound Russia, for Japan and Russia\r\nhave agreed to take the Manchurian spoil, as Japan did in the case\r\nof Korea, whenever the opportunity offers through dissension among\r\nthe powers. Japan and Russia are high-tariff countries, and wherever\r\nthey establish themselves, Britain, America, Germany and France will\r\nknock in vain for trade entry. China, like Britain, is a low-tariff\r\ncountry (at present five per cent., and even the proposed twelve per\r\ncent. would be low), and the manufacturing nations therefore desire\r\nthe “open door” maintained, which can only be done on America’s and\r\nBritain’s reiterated treaty stipulations of the “integrity of China”.\r\nAmerica must always keep a Pacific fleet stronger than Japan’s. A\r\nfight is unnecessary, for Japan is checkmated at once by this policy.\r\nBritain and America, and, if possible, Germany, must work together in\r\nthe Far East to watch both Russia and Japan, and see that China gets\r\nthe “square deal” in having reserved for her expansion her immemorial\r\npreserves of Manchuria, Mongolia and Turkestan. In Premier Yuan’s\r\ndifficulties, the irreconcilable former Manchu major general, Yin\r\nTchang, fled to Dalny, where he ran a bureau which plotted for the\r\noverthrow of the republic.\r\n\r\nChina made a beginning in 1911 in the agitation for the retrocession\r\nof some of the foreign colonies. Prince Ching then suggested that\r\ncommissioners should be appointed by the Cabinet to discuss with\r\nBritain the retrocession of Wei-Hai-Wei. There are other nations\r\nwhich hold vastly more territory than do America and Britain, whether\r\nin concessions, settlements or colonies. The other nations have\r\ndone comparatively little for China as compared with America and\r\nBritain, and Prince Ching might have approached this worthy subject in\r\nproportionate order. Until China is on her feet, foreign concessions at\r\nall her ports are the best object lesson she could have in municipal\r\ngovernment and improvements, but foreign colonies, as large as\r\nGermany’s Kiaochou and Japan’s and Russia’s spheres of occupation in\r\nManchuria, are unjust to her.\r\n\r\nThe New China party bears as a thorn in its flesh the awful burden of\r\n1900, the old Russian and the Japanese indemnities. America alone,\r\nunder President Roosevelt’s administration, remitted her share of the\r\n1900 (Boxer) indemnity. These punitive indemnity payments prevented\r\nChina from offering relief in the terrible pneumonic plague epidemic in\r\nManchuria in 1911, and in the famines which followed the floods in 1911\r\nand 1912 in the central and eastern provinces. Half a million people\r\nstarved to death, and China has not forgotten that the funds which\r\nthe starving people needed were taken by the rich European nations as\r\nindemnity payments. Britain, however, did return part of her indemnity\r\non condition that it should be applied to the Shansi University at\r\nTaiyuan, of which Doctor Timothy Richards was president.\r\n\r\nChina’s helpless position without a navy could not be more eloquently\r\nshown than by the following case: In the Mexican revolution of 1911,\r\nChinese lives and property were destroyed to the estimated amount of\r\n$33,000,000. China put in a claim to satisfy the heirs and claimants,\r\nbut no attention has been paid to it. How different it was when Germany\r\nand Britain held Venezuelan claims only a short time previously!\r\n\r\nIn the interim, before the establishment of an effective diplomacy and\r\nparliaments or congresses in China, the guilds, with their boycott,\r\nhave to a degree acted as the foreign office of the people in obtaining\r\nconcessions which armies, navies and courtiers were not yet powerful\r\nenough to obtain. Their effective boycotts are a proof that the people\r\nreally ruled in China, and without the expense of armies and navies.\r\nThey, moreover, proved that the Chinese people can think together,\r\nand keep their word of faith so fixedly that it is seldom necessary\r\nfor the central committee of the guilds to put in effect the heavy\r\nmoney penalties involved. There is this conclusion among others to be\r\ndrawn from the interesting history of guilds and boycotts in China,\r\nespecially in the last fifteen years, that the provincial and central\r\nparliaments, or congresses, which began work in 1909 and 1910, will\r\nremain, and with some improvement each year reach ever higher toward\r\nthe standards of liberty and righteousness, or, in expressive American\r\nslang, the “square deal”.\r\n\r\nWho will gainsay that the Chinese is a long-suffering being even in\r\nhis own land? I quote the following from the Hongkong _Telegraph_\r\nof September 1, 1911: “At 6.00 P. M., on August 25, a German in the\r\nemploy of a British company, and an Italian priest went into a shop at\r\nShek Ki (near Canton). The German, who disliked the demeanor of the\r\nshop employé, dealt the man a nasty cut on the head. The foreigners\r\nafterward left the shop and went to a money changer’s. As the changer\r\nwas slow, the German snatched a lamp from a table, and smashed it on\r\nthe ground. The German assaulted two chair coolies. A riot developed.\r\nThe two foreigners rushed into the dwelling of a missionary lady\r\ndoctor.” Such abuse as this leads to international troubles, and the\r\nconsuls at the ports, to whom the patient Chinese turn over foreign\r\noffenders, should be more severe than they are. These foreign offenders\r\nshould really be brought back to the village where they create a\r\ndisturbance, and in the presence of the consul, and Chinese taotais\r\nand mandarins, should pay to the headman of the village sufficient\r\ndamages. Then the Chinese would know that the foreigner is sincere in\r\nhis legal measures. Thoughtless or drunken action, like that of the\r\nGerman, often leads to missionary and other riots before the resentment\r\nof the indignant natives cools. One brutal fool of this kind, _violens\r\nin vino_, can place at jeopardy the lives of thousands of foreigners\r\nand the peace of the nations. We must scrupulously show China that\r\nwe are sincere. She has some cause to feel that when we established\r\nour extraterritorial courts we meant to cheat her of justice. We\r\nshall later hear from Wu Ting Fang on this subject, as he is making a\r\nspecialty of codifying the laws.\r\n\r\nThe British government introduced to the foreign office (Tsung Li Yamen\r\nand Wai Wu Pu) for many years, Sir Walter Hillier, as adviser, but\r\nsince his appointment was to a degree forced he had less influence than\r\nin the case of the voluntary appointments of the Americans, Dennison\r\nand Stevens, as advisers in the foreign offices of Japan and Korea,\r\nrespectively. The four-nations bankers will have foreign advisers on\r\nthe Chinese Finance and Foreign Boards, and great tact and patience\r\nwith China’s difficulties will at all times be required.\r\n\r\nLong before the revolution, as well as after it, the masses of the\r\nChinese had commenced to think of national and international politics.\r\nWhenever missionaries opened new “tan” (preaching or “talk” halls,\r\nas the Chinese call churches) the auditors listened respectfully for\r\na while to the “doctrine” or “tao” (way). When the missionary came\r\ndown from the platform, and joined the audience on the benches for a\r\nfamiliar “tan” (chat), religious subjects were not the first spoken of,\r\nthe following questioning being common:\r\n\r\n“Our first question is, what is your name, age and number of children?”\r\n\r\n“Did you come from your country by railway or steamship?”\r\n\r\n“How far is it and what was the cost?”\r\n\r\n“What is your real business outside of your kindly avocation of\r\nachieving merit by temporarily talking about Jesus?”\r\n\r\n“How long have you been in this province of China?”\r\n\r\n“Were your clothes made in a China port, or in America, and at what\r\ncost?”\r\n\r\n“You do not shave your head and face or change your outer clothes\r\noften, so we suppose you do not bathe often.”\r\n\r\n“What do you think of this talk of republics, foreign loans,\r\ncentralized government, armies and railways?”\r\n\r\nThere is no sycamore tree for Zacchæus to climb; he must come down.\r\nThey know you are peaceful as an amateur, but they insist on your\r\nprofessional opinion, and they believe your profession is something\r\nmore practical than talking religion. Are you a doctor, a government\r\nemployé, a farmer, a soldier, a spy, an artisan, a merchant? If so, you\r\nmust know about these practical things, and can answer the questions\r\npropounded.\r\n\r\nThe emigration treaties now stand in almost a humorous attitude in\r\none respect. To save Japan’s “face” (the Oriental idiom for pride),\r\nJapan is granted permission to land coolies, but Japan by a secret\r\npostscriptum agrees not to let her coolies make the slightest use of\r\nthis permission, as she has room for them in Korea, Manchuria, the\r\nnavy, etc., at present. China is not permitted to land her coolies, but\r\nland some of them she does by the “underground”, which runs via Canada,\r\nMexico, Central America, Cuba, etc. Our Pacific coast is correct,\r\nnotwithstanding the exigencies of diplomacy, that she can not and will\r\nnot absorb Oriental labor, any more than we foist Occidental labor\r\non the Orient. The Pacific coast is quite consistent for the “square\r\ndeal”, though it took her some time to trust the signing of the 1911\r\nJapan Treaty, the immigration clause of which it is secretly understood\r\nis not to be taken advantage of. America can not welcome too many\r\nChinese students and travelers, and a certain number of specialized\r\nmerchants, agriculturalists, agents, artisans and artists, whom we can\r\nwell accept as our tutors in their specialties.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of Asiatic immigration, the authority on American\r\nnaval and foreign affairs, Admiral Mahan, writes as follows: “A large\r\npreponderance of Asiatics in a given region is a real annexation, more\r\neffective than the political annexations against which the Monroe\r\ndoctrine was formulated. Free Asiatic immigration to the Pacific\r\ncoast in its present condition of sparse population would mean\r\nAsiatic occupation--Asia colonized in America. This the United States\r\ngovernment can not accept because of the violent resistance of the\r\nPacific states, if for no other reason.”\r\n\r\nIn a former book I have recommended the immigration of a number of\r\nChinese into the Philippines. The Straits Settlements cover only a\r\nsmall area. Their population is 300,000 Malays, who are akin to the\r\nFilipino. Four hundred thousand Chinese were brought in, and the\r\nlittle colony in 1911 exported $200,000,000 of tin and other products.\r\nSir Frank Swettenham, the famous governor of the settlement in its\r\nformative period up to 1904, says of the Chinese: “The industrial\r\ndevelopment of the country is entirely due to the Chinese. They are the\r\nonly people in the peninsula who can be depended upon. They tolerate\r\nno interruptions in the performance of their daily labor, and save\r\ntheir money to make prudent investments. Without the Chinese nothing\r\nwould have been done in the Malay states. No progress would have been\r\nmade, and the enormous natural resources of the country would still be\r\nlying dormant.” A remarkable instance of the orderliness of the Chinese\r\nwas exhibited in the deportation in 1908 of 60,000 Chinese emigrants\r\nfrom the Transvaal gold mines to China. Such a body of any other\r\nlabor would have shown many signs of rebellion against their removal\r\nfrom the scenes to which they had grown attached, and where they were\r\nprospering, and against the hot journey of 8,000 miles, made the more\r\nunpleasant because of the crowded quarters on shipboard. No friction or\r\ndisturbance marked this unusual industrial event. Coolies though they\r\nwere, they kept their word like statesmen, and said: “We promised the\r\ncolony that we would only substitute black labor for four years, and as\r\nthe blacks now are ready to return to the field, we are going.”\r\n\r\nThe nations should get together, and permit China to levy a provisional\r\nimport duty of twelve per cent. instead of five per cent., and not\r\nkeep her government helpless because of starvation. If she had an\r\narmy and navy like Japan, she would not need to ask the permission of\r\nothers to allow her own government to live. Advice should be given\r\nto her, as in the Mackay Treaty, to strike away the inter-provincial\r\nand inter-district fetters of likin (transit taxes) and export tax,\r\nby which method the provinces raise much of their revenue; and the\r\ngovernment should divide up the customs receipts between the provinces,\r\nor permit the provinces to keep all their land tax.\r\n\r\nFrance, which owns the only railway to Yunnan at present, is imposing\r\nan unjust transit tax of ten per cent. on American, British and German\r\ngoods, shipped from Hongkong to Yunnan, or vice versa, and which must\r\ncross French China. Canada in the same situation bids for American\r\nfreights by making no transit tax, and indeed quoting lower freight\r\nrates; this is intelligent modernism. China and the three commercial\r\nnations should have this Indo-Chinese tax removed, and demand equal\r\nrates on French railways. This rate equalization is what America has\r\ndemanded of Japan and Russia on railways in Manchuria. It is the same\r\nthing that Germany, at the point of the _Panther’s_ cannon, demanded of\r\nFrance in the Agadir incident in Morocco. In other words, the “square\r\ndeal”, and it must be put in effect, say the Chinese people and the\r\nnations which advocate the “open door”.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright, 1913, The Bobbs-Merrill Company.\r\n\r\n  The Gothic type of architecture introduced by the French; the\r\n    Catholic cathedral on Caine Road, on the slope of Hongkong.\r\n    Chinese contractors erect these buildings.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright, 1913, The Bobbs-Merrill Company.\r\n\r\n  Nan-Tang cathedral (French) towering over native roofs at Canton.\r\n    Up to the revolution, this offended the feng-shui superstition of\r\n    old China, and was a constant source of difficulty.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright, 1913, The Bobbs-Merrill Company.\r\n\r\n  Cement hill roads, South China, Kwangtung province.

The proposition is to use foreign coal in manufacturing.\r\nAccordingly, measures have been taken to develop the Manchurian,\r\nKorean, Saghalien and Formosan fields, as well as purchasing from the\r\nrich Chinese supplies. This conservation method will certainly be\r\nfollowed by Australia, England, Germany and America, as the years go\r\nby. The export of coal is not a benefit; it is an impoverishment. The\r\nJapanese make into briquettes the anthracite coal of Ping Yang, Korea,\r\nso as to produce a smokeless navy coal.\r\n\r\nAn interesting aftermath of the Boxer massacres in 1900 was the strange\r\ndisappearance of the Manchu prince, Liang Chow, who was condemned to\r\nbe strangled in private with the silver cord, which two unseen friends\r\nwere to tighten behind two holes bored in a wall. Prince Liang fled\r\nto America, where he became a pauper, and was buried in the Alamosa,\r\nColorado, cemetery. At the request of the Manchu throne his body was\r\nexhumed on November 25, 1910, and started on its way to China to the\r\ntombs of the Manchu emperors west of Peking (not the Ming tombs, which\r\nare northwest). A splendid, dragon-gilded coffin was furnished, and\r\nthe Manchus sent magnificent mandarin robes, a yellow jacket, peacock\r\nfeather and pearl button of honor. The Chinese whom Prince Liang found\r\nin America were not Manchus, but republican Cantonese of southern\r\nKwangtung province.\r\n\r\nHongkong, the dean of foreign settlements, Shanghai, Tientsin,\r\nSingapore, Hankau, Harbin, etc., all have volunteer military companies\r\nand inter-port rifle matches. Every man in a settlement can be\r\nimpressed for the protection of life and property. All these uniformed\r\ncompanies have seen hard active service in the taking of Kowloon,\r\nthe various riots at Shanghai, the Peking Relief Expedition and the\r\nrevolution which broke out at Hankau in October, 1911. The companies\r\ncover infantry, machine and field gun, bicycle and garrison corps\r\ntrained in the use of cannon. Hongkong’s uniformed contingent at\r\nKing George’s coronation in London attracted much attention for the\r\nsmartness of their swinging march. “We didn’t think the jaded tropics\r\ncould turn out such ambition,” was the remark of many onlookers.\r\n\r\nThe English historian, Creasy, who lived in the Far East, in writing\r\nhis book, _Decisive Battles of the World_, as early as 1852 recognized\r\nthe importance of America’s mission across the Pacific. These are his\r\nwords: “The conquests of China and Japan by the fleets and armies\r\nof the United States are events which many now living are likely to\r\nwitness. Compared with the magnitude of such changes in the dominion\r\nof the old world, the certain ascendancy of the Anglo-Americans over\r\ncentral and southern America seems a matter of secondary importance.”\r\nIf we change Creasy’s favorite idea of physical conquest to that of\r\nmoral, educational and commercial, with physical power only as an\r\nauxiliary in the case of the heinous jealousy of those not concerned,\r\nwe shall agree with him as to America’s advance across the Pacific.\r\nIt was nevertheless a wonderful prophecy, made as long ago as 1852,\r\nwhen the tide of America’s western advance, with the exception of one\r\nmeager settlement, had not yet risen over the Rockies. All the Chinese\r\nleaders, republican and conservative, look for the growing evidence\r\nof America’s interests across the Pacific, and American affairs and\r\nhistory are keenly studied.\r\n\r\nSome of the Chinese proverbs on international politics are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n“He who doesn’t follow up his words with deeds is no more terrible than\r\nthe wind on painted water.”\r\n\r\n“If you have to guess at roads, the middle one will average up best.”\r\n\r\n“Go slow; only the turtle is equipped to draw his head in suddenly.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t cross a river with your feet in two boats.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nCHINESE INTERNAL POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost the oldest book in China, the _Chou Li_, provided for village\r\nmanagement at the same time that sacrifices were instituted, thousands\r\nof years before the Christian era. The oldest man of the clan-village,\r\nbearing the title of “hsiang lao” (village old-one) takes charge at\r\na salary of about one hundred and fifty dollars a year, and hires\r\nsay twenty police in the smaller villages. This “hsiang lao”, when\r\nnecessary, deals with the district “siunkian”, who is the government’s\r\nlowest mandarin. The people express their views in an open “hsiang”\r\nmeeting, which is the same as the old town meeting of New England, on\r\nwhich present democratic institutions in America are based; an “open\r\nprimary”, for that matter.\r\n\r\nIn the guild councils of the cities, the more experienced tradesmen\r\nhave had political experience in their dealings with the “taotai”,\r\na higher class of mandarin. From “hsiang” and guild meetings, the\r\nnext step was to send delegates to viceroys, or even delegates to the\r\nBoard of Censors at Peking, accusing viceroys. China, therefore, had\r\nsome experience in politics before the reformers of 1898 induced the\r\nimpressionable young Emperor Kwang Hsu to issue his famous edicts,\r\nwhich started a wave that rolled on, lifting provincial assemblies,\r\nparliaments, and revolutionists into view; and the wave is rolling\r\nonward still. Kwang Hsu as early as 1891 issued an edict praising\r\nand protecting missionaries. He was never permitted to travel, but\r\nlearned from books, brought to him by Kang Yu Wei and the other new\r\nspirits, what was going on in the outside world. In 1894 Kwang Hsu sent\r\nto the American Bible Society at Peking a request for copies of the\r\ntwo Testaments, “such as are sold to THE PEOPLE”. His immortal edicts\r\nbegan to appear in the Peking _Gazette_ on June 23, 1898, and ended in\r\nSeptember of that year, when he was imprisoned by the empress dowager\r\nand Yuan Shih Kai. During the issuance of the edicts the dowager was\r\nat the summer palace, eight miles northwest of Peking, where she was\r\npreparing her reactionary plans. The edicts covered the following:\r\n\r\n    1. New learning for much of the old classical essays. This\r\n    reform is in force.\r\n\r\n    2. Modern army, navy, railways, telephone, telegraph. The slow\r\n    progress of the Lu-Han (Peking to Hankau) Railway was commented\r\n    on. These reforms are under way, and full of promise.\r\n\r\n    3. Publicity of national and provincial figures of receipt\r\n    and expenditure; i. e., a budget. This reform was instituted\r\n    by the National Assembly in 1911, and will be adopted by the\r\n    republicans.\r\n\r\n    4. All citizens to have the privilege of memorializing the\r\n    Throne independent of the Censor Board.\r\n\r\n    5. Extension of mail service. This is being brought about by\r\n    the extension of the railway service, and the government taking\r\n    over private post routes of guilds.\r\n\r\n    6. Prince Ching to secure assistance from foreigners in\r\n    establishing a national university, with branches in provincial\r\n    capitals. Departments of universities at Peking, Canton,\r\n    Shanghai, Nanking, Paoting, Tientsin, Hankau, etc., have been\r\n    established. The English universities, acting under the\r\n    suggestions of Sir Robert Hart and Lord Cecil, will assist,\r\n    as will also America. This is secular education. The mission\r\n    schools are, of course, extending to many new cities.\r\n\r\nLet us step into one of the meetings of the first partially formed\r\nParliament, which opened in 1910. We would call it a Senate. They\r\ncalled it Tzu Cheng Yuan; that is, Property Laws Assembly, or Taxing\r\nAssembly. The Parliament buildings at Peking, not being completed,\r\nthe Congress met in the law hall of the Peking University. This hall\r\nis a two-story western style building, the only Chinese feature being\r\nthe heavy tiled roof. The windows are square and have modern sashes.\r\nThe door is Roman and not Chinese in curve. The Lower House was not\r\nyet formed. In the front row of two hundred members were Mongol\r\nprinces, Manchu princes, viceroys, governors, mandarins, appointed\r\nby the Crown, and farther back were men sent up by the provincial\r\nassemblies. The great Prince Pu Lun of the royal blood, whom I had\r\nthe pleasure of meeting at Hongkong, and who was commissioner to the\r\nSt. Louis Exposition in 1904, most affable, stout and progressive,\r\nopens the assembly with bland dignity. Shen Chia Pan, the temporary\r\nvice-president, sits on his left. The debate at once opens like the\r\nsmall fire of machine guns. It takes up appeals by the provincial\r\nassemblies on the actions of the provincial governors. Education,\r\nforeign loans, provincial versus nationalized railways, pensions to\r\nManchus, suppression of opium, acts of departmental secretariates,\r\nthe leakage in tax collection, the corruption of courts, the police\r\nto serve the people and not against the people, high tax rate\r\nagainst the poor and low tax rate against the rich, taxation without\r\nrepresentation, foreign aggression in Manchuria and Turkestan,\r\ninsults to the flag abroad, nepotism, etc., are discussed, and the\r\nsecretariates have a lively time defending themselves from the\r\ncritical, eloquent pure Chinese Cantonese; the independent Hunanese\r\nwho have many Cromwells among them, and who are foremost for running\r\nChinese mines and railways without foreign money; the tradition-loving\r\nSzechuen men; the literati and capitalists from Kiangsu; the traveled\r\nbankers from Shansi province; the cosmopolitan men from the imperial\r\nprovince of Pechili and Shangtung; the rough-rider Mongols from far\r\nwest Shensi and Kansu provinces; and the Patrick Henrys from turbulent\r\nFukien province. The Throne is compelled to promise a Lower House in\r\n1913 instead of 1915, and at last, in its edict, gives all credit\r\nto the crushed reformer, Emperor Kwang Hsu, who learned reform from\r\nthe Bible and other western books surreptitiously introduced despite\r\nthe eunuch spies of the reactionary Empress Dowager Tse Hsi. This\r\npreliminary Senate stormily sends a suggestion to the oligarchic Grand\r\nCouncil of the Regent that reform shall be evidenced by the regent and\r\nthe infant Emperor Pu Yi having their queues cut off. Thus the spirited\r\ndebate rolled back and forth between the old Grand Council and the new\r\nCongress or Parliament, until the guns of the impatient revolution\r\nthundered at Hankau, like Cromwell on the doors of the Long Parliament.\r\n\r\nConfucius himself was a politician. He lived in an age of able prime\r\nministers of some ten highly civilized, equal states, fighting\r\ngenerally by diplomacy for mastery, on the pretext of the right to\r\nmonopolize the succession to perform the sacred rites of the parent\r\nChou state, which alone was weak. These prime ministers were all abler\r\nmen than were the titular rulers of the states. Confucius studied\r\ndiplomacy in the writings of Kwan Tsz, premier-philosopher of the\r\nadjoining Tsi state. Kwan Tsz’ writings are sometimes published with\r\nLao Tsz’ works, but should not be confounded with them. Confucius was\r\nalso influenced by his friend, the great diplomat, Shuh Hiang, prime\r\nminister of the Tsin state, which was situated far to the northwest of\r\nhis native state of Lu; also by the very able minister Tsz Chan of the\r\nstate of Cheng, which lay west of Lu. He had to keep his wits awake\r\nto save the small and weaker Lu state from succumbing to the policies\r\nof the ambitious Yen Tsz, prime minister of the Tsi state, which was\r\nsituated immediately north of Lu, and from falling before the intrigue\r\nof Kupeh Yu, prime minister of Wei state, lying to the northwest.\r\nThis last state afforded Confucius a long exile, when his vicious,\r\nungrateful, new prince hounded him for fourteen years by an ancient\r\nsystem of “Black List” out of his positions with some thirty states,\r\ncontent neither to use his eminent services, nor to let him live that\r\nother states might avail of them. He knew too much about law-breaking\r\nby those who occupied the “seats of the mighty”; and “such men are\r\ndangerous”! Devoted as they are to the study of Confucius’ life, the\r\nChinese thereby imbibed politics.\r\n\r\nHistory throws light on some of the insidiousness of ancient\r\nChinese intrigue. As long ago as 626 B. C. the ruler of the Chinese\r\nprincipality of Ts’in, which state was oppressed by the manly Tartars,\r\nsent to the Tartar chief two companies of singing girls “that he might\r\nbe too weak to ride the saddle at the head of his cavalry”. In 486\r\nB. C. the prince of Tsi state, lying to the north of Lu state, sent\r\nto the prince of Lu state, Confucius’ master, a company of singing\r\ngirls to ensnare manliness in the lap of debauchery, with the result\r\nthat Confucius in disgust left the service of his prince and became a\r\nhounded exile, laughed out of his court by the powerful who for the\r\ntime were above the law. Where have been that most venerable family on\r\nearth, the Kungs of Shangtung province, who have lived at Kufu near\r\nYenchow, in all the recent turbulence in China? We have heard of Manchu\r\nprinces, of leaders of the Chinese like Kang and Sun, Yuan, General Li,\r\nand Wu Ting Fang; of descendants of the old Ming emperors, etc., but\r\nwhy have not the lineal descendants of Confucius put forward a man able\r\nto handle politics, war and literature as did their great ancestor?\r\nWhat an opportunity they have had recently. What an opportunity they\r\nhave yet to put forward a man for the presidency, whom all China and\r\nall the world will be delighted to accept if he is only one-twentieth\r\nas able as his immortal ancestor.\r\n\r\nThe secret society, too, has played a great part in internal politics.\r\nIt is not so necessary now as it was. The pitiless publicity of\r\na democracy or constitutional monarchy makes secret duplicity\r\nunnecessary. The Kao Ming Tang was Yuan Shih Kai’s and Prince\r\nChing’s society. At the other extreme was the Kao-lao-Hwei and other\r\nanti-Manchu secret societies. It was the union of the Triad secret\r\nsociety with the Taiping rebels that made that revolution powerful\r\nenough to spread from Canton to Nanking. In the Boxer days of 1900 the\r\nBuddhist secret society, Tsai Li Hwei, extended its scope to cover\r\nthe new movement. Their watchword was: “Store grain for war; collect\r\nforage; revolt”. The Sia Hwei (reform association), Tung Men Hwei\r\n(sworn brother), and other secret societies established in China and\r\nthroughout the world by Sun Yat Sen, had much to do with the successful\r\npreliminary work that made the revolution possible.\r\n\r\nThe old lines of political demarcation are passing away, and new lines\r\nwill be drawn in some instances. The powerful viceroys of the fourteen\r\nmain provinces were located and named as follows:\r\n\r\n“Viceroy of Pechili” province, at Tientsin.\r\n\r\n“Viceroy of Shen Kan” (i. e. Shensi and Kansu provinces), at Singan.\r\n\r\n“Viceroy of Kiangnan” (i. e. Kiangsu, Nganhwei and Kiangsi provinces),\r\nat Nanking.\r\n\r\n“Viceroy of Hu Kwang”, or “Viceroy of Liang Hu” (i. e. Hunan and Hupeh\r\nprovinces), at Wuchang.\r\n\r\n“Viceroy of Min Che” (i. e. Chekiang and Fukien provinces), at Fuchau.\r\n\r\n“Viceroy of Liang Kwang” (i. e. Kwangtung and Kwangsi provinces), at\r\nCanton.\r\n\r\n“Viceroy of Yun Kwei” (i. e. Yunnan and Kweichou provinces), at Yunnan.\r\n\r\nThe favorite retreats for these retired officials are the five cities\r\nof cultured Kiangsu province: Shanghai, Suchow, Chinkiang, Yangchow\r\nand Nanking; and one city in adjoining Chekiang province, Hangchow. If\r\nthe clubs of these cities could by a dictograph breathe what they have\r\nheard, volumes of wonderful interest would keep a score of publishers\r\nbusy. China has entered the world arena because of her human interest\r\non a vast scale.\r\n\r\nThe Manchu may try to come back, as the irreconcilable Major General\r\nYin Tchang has been plotting from Japanese Dalny. The doctrine of\r\nsacred right, as strongly as the Hohenzollern has enunciated it, has\r\nbeen preached before in China. The Manchu, with this in view, would\r\nnot abdicate until he was assured that in him would lie the ancient\r\nright to pay the sacred Chou sacrifices, which are 4,000 years old.\r\nThe builder of the Great Wall, the Emperor Tsin, 200 B. C., said “Shao\r\nMing Yu Tien” (Heaven gives me my decree to reign). Sunyacius and the\r\nrepublicans of 1911 said: “Tien Ming Wu Chang” (The divine right lasts\r\nnot forever).\r\n\r\nSome of the political proverbs of the people are the following:\r\n\r\n“An oligarchic government bites harder than a tiger.”\r\n\r\n“A good hearer knows twice as much as a foolish talker, for he knows\r\nhimself and he knows the talker, too.”\r\n\r\n“The great statesman makes public opinion his opinion.”\r\n\r\n“When the whale gets out of his element, even minnows can safely laugh.”\r\n\r\n“In the rise and decline of his country, each man has his share.”\r\n\r\nChang Chih Tung, the famous viceroy of Wuchang in 1909, used to say,\r\n“Treachery can turn fame to everlasting stench.” May the New China not\r\nbe a traitor to progress. Chang was the progressive who established,\r\namong many other modern plants, the wonderfully successful Hanyang\r\nsteel plant, whose products are used in Europe, both coasts of America,\r\nJapan and in China on the roadbed from Canton to Harbin, 2,000 miles of\r\nshining steel, in that “Celestial” land that is beginning to find that\r\nit has a grand terrestrial future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nSOME PUBLIC WORKS IN OLD CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nWill the spirit which instituted the ancient notable public works of\r\nChina revive again? That is the question. The greatest irrigation work\r\nin the world, 2,100 years old, is in China at Chingtu. It was invented\r\nby Li Ping, the engineer-governor, B. C. 250. A plain seventy-five\r\nmiles by forty miles is irrigated. It supports nearly 4,000,000 people.\r\nThe water is taken from the Min River at Kwan Hien above Chingtu in\r\nApril, and is permitted to run in the thousands of channels until\r\nNovember. Then the great banks of the Min are restored, as the rains\r\nare sufficient, and the river runs in its old bed to join the “father\r\nof waters”, the Yangtze River, at Sui Fu. The dikes are made of iron,\r\ncement, stone, timber and bamboo cradles. Li left this message, which\r\nis cut in the stones of his tomb outside the walls of Chingtu: “Shen\r\nTao Tan Ti Tso Yen” (Dig deep the bars, keep low the dikes). The\r\nChinese are going to use these works to produce power and light as well\r\nas irrigation.\r\n\r\nAt Li Ling, over the Lu Ho River in southeast Hunan province, is a\r\nhigh wooden cantilever bridge of six spans, four hundred and eighty\r\nfeet long and twenty feet wide, paved with cobbles, and covered with\r\nan awning. The substructure is masonry, and the cantilever principle\r\nis obtained by increasing the length of the pier timbers as they are\r\nlaid on one another. I want to describe a beautiful suspension bridge\r\nover the Yang Ti River near Tali in Yunnan province, which shows that\r\nengineering ability was generally spread throughout the provinces to\r\nreach thus far in the extreme southwest. The double piers on each\r\nside of the stream rise in great strength, and the arch is joined and\r\nroofed over most artistically in characteristic Chinese style, like\r\na temple. Eight suspended iron chains make the floor of the bridge,\r\nwhich is anchored half-way up the stone piers, under the arch. From\r\nthe chains arises a bamboo fence, which is kept from spreading by\r\nstanchions, under which you must stoop at regular distances. There is\r\na commemoration statue of a recumbent water buffalo at the foot of one\r\nof the pairs of piers. It and the bridge are all that remain of the\r\nforgotten assemblage of orators, patrons, troops and society which ages\r\nago graced the occasion, another triumph of the doers over the talkers.\r\nThe engineer and the architect alone build their own monuments. As in\r\nthe case of Christopher Wren at St. Paul’s, “_Si monumentum requiris,\r\ncircumspice_.”\r\n\r\nChina thinks more of the engineer than we credit her with thinking;\r\notherwise she would not have criticized the Manchu so much of late.\r\nBetween high banks over the River Lou, in west Szechuen province, is\r\nthe famous Lou Ting Haio bridge, built in 1700. It is one hundred and\r\nninety-two feet long and has nine suspended iron chains, with loose\r\nplanks laid across. At Chow Chu, near Swatow, there is a beautiful\r\nstone pier bridge over the Han River. Shops are established at each\r\npier, and the floor of the shop protrudes, and is supported with great\r\npoles that retreat back to the piers. A daily fair is held upon the\r\nbridge, because it is the most central point for the travelers from\r\nmany villages. Each village of the district has its own day for its\r\nfair. At Changchow, near Amoy, is a wonderful bridge, from engineering\r\nand artistic points of view. The great Chah Siang built it eight\r\nhundred years ago from voluntary subscriptions. It is one thousand\r\nyards long. There are one hundred and twenty piers, and the height\r\nabove the water is forty feet. Five stones of one hundred tons each,\r\ntwenty feet long, compose the roadway, each stone being several feet\r\nwide. The piers up-stream are made with a cutwater bow. At Kweiyang,\r\nthe capital of Kweichau province, a massive stone bridge of ten piers,\r\nwith cutwaters, shows what ancient China could execute in masonry.\r\nNear the rich coal mines at Ping Hsiang, in Kiangsi province, there\r\nis a high five-arched, pier-pinnacled, balustraded bridge, which is\r\nsingularly beautiful. There are shrines on the piers, which also\r\nhave cutwaters. Chinese engineers discovered the principles of\r\nthe true arch; that is, a complete ring of voussoirs, and not the\r\nsuccession of protruding corbels invented by the Hindus. The Chinese\r\nare just discovering western industry and inventions, but we are just\r\ndiscovering Chinese engineering, with engineers like their Yu and Chah\r\nSiang, and the modern “Jeme”, which will cause not a little surprise\r\nand enthusiasm in the practical Occidental world.\r\n\r\nAt Yangchow, on the Yangtze River, there is a remarkable pavilion\r\nbridge. The heaviest part of the stone bridge is in the middle of\r\nthe stream, which is let through the masonry in a number of half and\r\nfull arch tunnels. Over these tunnels rises the heavy masonry pile,\r\ntopped with an artistic balustrade. On this is a superstructure of\r\nfive beautiful pavilions, with prominent up-curling eaves. The bridge\r\ndescends on each side to the banks along a sloping abutment. It is an\r\nexceptional structure even for varied China, both from an artistic and\r\nengineering standpoint. The ancient Liu Ko stone bridge over the Hun\r\nRiver north of Peking is famous for its lion-pier terminals, its carved\r\nstone balustrade which is in the ornate style. After leaving Szechuen\r\nprovince, on the road into Yunnan, over the Niu Lan River, at Kiang Ti,\r\nis a noted suspension bridge, hung between two heavy piers in a gorge,\r\nthe piers being surmounted with curve-roofed pavilions. The carvings of\r\nmonkeys, lions, etc., are very fine. The bridge, which is one hundred\r\nand fifty feet by twelve feet, is made of iron chains, pulled very\r\ntaut, showing the unusual strength of the anchorage. There is also a\r\nhand chain. The pavilions are, as usual, used as a restaurant and an\r\ninn for travelers.\r\n\r\nThe two most famous suspension bridges are over the Mekong River in\r\nYunnan province, between Tali and Yungchang, and over the Salween River\r\non the main road to Burma. These chain bridges are hung from heavy\r\npiers deep down in the vast gorges, and show that men were mighty\r\nenough in those old days to tackle so mighty a problem. The Ban Chiao\r\nbridge at Yungchang is worthy of the famous engineers of that province.\r\nStrong stone piers are sunk down into the swift stream and anchored to\r\nthe high banks. A secure bridge has been laid down over this support.\r\nThe abutments are raised and roofed with a glorious double pagoda,\r\nthe ridge, curling eaves, flying supports and ornaments all being\r\nsplendidly carved. The bridge itself is protected with a balustrade,\r\nand is roofed with tiles throughout. It is both an artistic and a\r\nsubstantial structure. So much for the beautiful bridges of the old\r\nrégime, nearly all it will be noted in the native Chinese section of\r\nthe country. Herr Dorpmuller and other German engineers are teaching\r\nthe Chinese the revival of stone bridges by the massive structures\r\nwhich they have erected on the line of the Tientsin-Pukow railway.\r\n\r\nA beginning has been made in erecting iron truss bridges. The very\r\nlong pier bridge carrying the Peking-Hankau (Belgian built) railway\r\nacross the Yellow River is well known, and has stood longer than it was\r\nthought it would because of the shifting foundation. The eight-pier\r\nsteel bridge over the Hwei River on the line of the Tientsin-Pukow\r\nrailway was erected by the Wright-Headson Company, of Motherwell,\r\nScotland. At Shanghai there is the wide Garden bridge. A steel bridge\r\nhas been erected over the Yellow River at Lanchow, the capital of\r\nremote Kansu province, and at Tientsin is the Chin Kung truss bridge.\r\nAt Chungking a structure has been erected across the Yalung River.\r\nThe Hongkong-Canton, Tientsin-Nanking, Peking-Hankau, North China and\r\nKiachou-Tsinan railways of course have many steel culvert bridges.\r\nThere are already a considerable number of remarkable steel truss\r\nbridges of eighteen to twenty-four spans over Liao, Nu Erh, Hsiao,\r\nTaling, Sha, Tawen, Yellow and other great rivers of China. The French\r\nrailway, from Haiphong to Yunnan City, is built over one hundred small\r\nbridges in the crossing of the Red River, Namti and Song River valleys.\r\n\r\nFrom Peking to Tungchow, at the head of navigation from the coast,\r\nabout twenty miles, runs a broad road paved five hundred years ago\r\nby the Ming kings with immense blocks, three feet square by two feet\r\nthick. The road sadly needs resetting, but one can readily imagine\r\nwhat a splendidly substantial road it once was in those spacious days\r\nof the last of the pure Chinese kings. The Ming thought of art and\r\npublic works. The Manchu has thought more of intrigue and private\r\ndinners since he gave up riding horses and living in tents. One of the\r\nstrongest charges against the Manchu was that he threw the great public\r\nworks which he inherited into ruin. This Tungchow Road is the road over\r\nwhich commerce, invasion and many a dignified embassy have gone during\r\nthe recent strenuous centuries.\r\n\r\nThe Che Ling Road runs from Chinchow, in Hunan province, to Canton.\r\nThis is the road the new railway will take. The foot road is fifteen\r\nfeet wide and composed of great stone blocks one foot thick. Before\r\ntraffic was gathered at Hankau and Canton by steamships, the traffic on\r\nthe Che Ling foot road was very heavy, and shops lined the long stone\r\nhighway. Another famous road, the Mei Ling, also composed of stone\r\nblocks, climbs the great Nan Shan (Southern Mountains) and connects\r\nNangan in Kiansi province and Canton. This is the road that Abbé Huc\r\ntook in 1849 when he made his daring journey from Tibet to Chingtu,\r\nChungking, Hankau, Kowkiang, Nanchang, up the Kan River to Canton and\r\nMacao. There is a famous imperial road from Peking to Jehol, through\r\nKupikan pass, where the Manchus may finally be segregated. The road\r\nfrom Peking to the Ming tombs is paved with a course of large stones.\r\nThe “Great Road” runs from Peking to Canton along the coast, and\r\nanswers to the old Japanese “Tokkaido”, which runs from Tokio to Kioto.\r\nIt was a Mongol road, dating back to the Great Wall. The best Chinese\r\nroads, however, were made in the tenth, eleventh and twelfth centuries\r\nA. D., during the Sung dynasty, whose capital was Hangchow.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the province of Szechuen built sixty-five miles of a mountain\r\nriver road in the gorges of the Yangtze River, starting from Kwei-chow\r\nand running eastward. The road is from one hundred to five hundred feet\r\nabove high water and is cut six feet wide and eight feet high into the\r\nlimestone cliffs, truly a splendid revival of the noble works of the\r\nMing kings, and in a sublime situation not to be equaled anywhere.\r\nThe Szechuen people boast that their “road goes where a monkey\r\ncouldn’t hang”. The road was planned and executed entirely on Chinese\r\ninitiative. The best known road in China, and considering its length,\r\nthe best conditioned road in the empire, runs for four hundred miles\r\nin Szechuen province from Wan Hsien on the Yangtze River, overland to\r\nChingtu City, the capital. It is called the Siao Pen Lu (smaller north\r\nroad), and is paved to the width of six feet. It has many wonderful\r\nstaircases cut up mountain faces. The road could be shortened one\r\nhundred miles if bridges were built at the gorges. An internationally\r\nowned railway was planned for this route. From Chungking to Chingtu in\r\nSzechuen province, up hill and down, and across fields and marshes,\r\nruns a traveled road paved much of the way with large stone slabs. From\r\nChungking to Sui Fu, along the Yangtze River for two hundred miles\r\nruns a notable stone road five feet wide. Along all these old roads\r\nthe freight of 400,000,000 people has been carried on the backs of\r\nmen and women, and even children, whether by barrow or shoulder load,\r\nduring the long quiet centuries, at an awful cost of money; for too\r\nlarge a proportion of the nation has been engaged in the transportation\r\nas compared with the producing department, and this is one reason why\r\nChina has been poor so long.\r\n\r\nWells have been sunk by contractors, with whom the mayor of the village\r\n(hsiang lao) dealt. A brick caisson, fitted on a bamboo frame, is dug\r\nunder and sunk. On this caisson the upper wall is built. Sometimes\r\niron-pointed bamboo pipes are driven through the bottom of the well.\r\nThese old methods will give way to the new, and windmills will begin to\r\nhum in old China.\r\n\r\nThe modern water-works of Peking take the water from the Sha Ho, a\r\nclear stream in the Western Hills. There are settling tanks, pumping\r\nstations, stand-pipes, etc. One hundred and thirty thousand families\r\nare supplied from the mains. The same concession to labor has been made\r\nas at Hongkong, in that the cleaning of the filter sand and gravel is\r\ndone by hand instead of by machine. Nearly all the treaty ports are\r\nputting in modern water-works, which have been sorely needed. China’s\r\ndeath rate is decreasing, and it is not necessary, even from a Chinese\r\npoint of view, that there should be so many births or dual wives any\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nElectric light plants are in operation at nearly all the coast treaty\r\nports, as well as at some of the Yangtze treaty ports and West River\r\nports inland. In the Occident, intellectual and spiritual light\r\npreceded lighted roads and the light of science, but as everything is\r\nopposite in China, it seems that science is preceding intellectual and\r\nspiritual light. But “these twain shall meet in one equator round the\r\nglobe”.\r\n\r\nThe Lighthouse Department of the National Customs is employing foreign\r\nengineers in harbor and channel work, and some improvements have been\r\nmade on the coast and along the rivers, the provincial authorities\r\nmaking a special tax wherever possible to foot the bills. Often the\r\nboatmen, merchants’ and bankers’ guilds are required to subscribe.\r\n\r\nThe first systematized attempt to handle public works scientifically\r\nwas undertaken by the provincial assemblies of Nganhwei and Kiangsu\r\nprovinces in the summer of 1911, during the awful famines, which\r\nfollowed the great floods. America has sent large contributions of\r\nflour and money for rice. The assemblies put the men, whom the floods\r\nwithheld from their fields, on railway building, canal dredging, bridge\r\nbuilding, and road making. It was along these roads that the triumphant\r\nright wing of the republicans marched, headed by Generals Hsu and\r\nLing, in the memorable attack on Nanking, which broke the imperial\r\nresistance, and threw the Manchu over the yamen wall!\r\n\r\nSelf-reliance is half brother of independence. I have found that with\r\nthese improvements has grown up not a little talk of “China for the\r\nChinese”. One finds constant complaints in the native Chinese press\r\nthat lucrative contracts, such as the erection of government buildings,\r\nare given to Japanese and other foreign contractors instead of local\r\nfirms. The signs, taken altogether, are hopeful, and West and East have\r\nenough to interchange without overlapping each other. Nice adjustments\r\nwill have to be made in some cases, but tact, patience, mutual sympathy\r\nand altruism will in the end overcome any misunderstandings that may\r\narise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nTHE INFLUENCE OF JAPAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1911 Japan’s tariff agreements expired and a new high tariff\r\nwas put into effect in the effort to raise $300,000,000 a year\r\nas the state’s revenue. The same result was experienced as in\r\nIndia. Home manufacturers operated in the smaller industries, and\r\nmany larger foreign capitalists opened Japanese branches. For\r\ninstance, the Lever Soap Company, of England, came to Osaka, and\r\nthe Armstrong-Vickers-Maxim Company, of Newcastle, the gun-founders\r\nand warship builders, came to Muroran in Ezo Island, to be near the\r\ncoal mines, the iron ore being imported largely from Tayeh, China,\r\nand much of the pig iron from Hanyang, China. Prices of living have\r\nadvanced beyond wages, and in 1912 the municipalities of Tokio, etc.,\r\nhad to open free rice kitchens to feed crowds of the impoverished and\r\nunemployed. The poor bear the heaviest share of the new taxes and the\r\nincreased prices levied by the trusts. The profits of some of the large\r\ntrusts go out of the country. There is the same complaint as in China,\r\nthat foreign capital and home monopoly are exploiting franchises,\r\nsubsidy chests and tariffs. The new high tariff is a success for the\r\nmonopolists, just as the American tariff was from 1865 to 1911. The\r\ncomplaint among the people of the privilege-made-wealth running the\r\ngovernment and burdening the taxpayer is as bitter as in some other\r\ncountries. The suffrage being limited in Japan to five millions out\r\nof sixty million people, this discontent does not yet show itself so\r\nquickly as in America and Britain. American and British newspapers,\r\nmagazines and books which voice reform, and real and not deputized\r\nrepresentation of the taxed, are translated, and widely read, not only\r\nin Japan, but in China.\r\n\r\nThe world knows the effective work of the Japanese press bureau,\r\norganized with the aid of foreign advisers, before the Japan-Russia\r\nWar. This included the publication of Professor Nitobe’s book on\r\n_Bushido_ in Philadelphia, glorifying to the highest pitch of the\r\nwarm Oriental imagination everything Japanese. This had much to do\r\nwith preparing the way for the Japanese advance in Manchuria. That\r\npress bureau has been strengthened, and has its inspired organs in\r\nsome of the large cities of the Occident. No other country is able to\r\ncolor the news on occasions as Japan is able. With the cry of _lèse\r\nmajesté_, Japan, Germany and Russia seem to be successful in stamping\r\nout much of the independent criticism of the taxed, or those to whom\r\nequal opportunity has been denied. There seems to be only one hope for\r\nreal liberty in Japan and elsewhere, the rise again, as in Bunyan’s,\r\nMilton’s and Franklin’s time, of the independent pamphlet and book,\r\nwhose one motto shall be, “No taxation without real representation.”\r\n\r\nThe Japanese have appointed the Koreans, Count Yi and Viscount Cho, to\r\nrepresent the absorbed Korean people, and these two men are expected\r\nto sign every document praising the rule of the Japanese, which\r\ndocument is then wired over the world by the thoroughly organized\r\npress agency. The former immense missionary influence of the Americans\r\namong the common people is slowly being choked out, and the large\r\nforeign gold and other mining industries of Korea, which promised so\r\nwell, are also now under strict watch. In other words, the system of\r\ndummification has been applied to Korean politics, and the famous\r\nAmerican teachers and political advisers have found it well to leave\r\nthe peninsula. I would instance the long articles in the New York\r\n_Times_ of June 6, 1912, and the New York _Herald_ of September 1,\r\n1912, in which the American Presbyterian and other churches charge\r\nthe Japanese bureaucracy with wholesale persecution, “planting” of\r\nevidence, imprisonment and torture of thousands of Korean political\r\nprisoners as late as 1912. Two methods of colonization face each other\r\nin contrast at the threshold of China--the Japanese method in Korea,\r\nand the American method in the Philippines. Both are progressing\r\ncommercially, but the latter alone is progressing educationally and\r\naltruistically, so far. It is noticeable in Korea that the Japanese are\r\nbreaking down many beautiful walls and temples to build in their place\r\nugly utilitarian houses. They pay very little respect to those whom\r\nthey have conquered. They are obliterators of art, where art detains\r\nutility. The name of the land has been changed to Chosen. In Manchuria,\r\ndespite conventions, the Japanese maintain ten times the railway guard\r\nof soldiers agreed upon. Japan will bear friendly watching everywhere,\r\nas the American writers, Millard and Homer Lea, are constantly urging.\r\nHer armaments cost her a heavy taxation and she is searching for ways\r\nto recoup herself. If Manchuria is to be saved to China, it will be\r\nowing more to America’s insistence than to Britain, for Britain at\r\npresent is tied up to Japan, and Britain in India has given a hostage\r\nto the East. Perhaps the best way to save Manchuria is to encourage\r\nChinese emigration, and this plan is now working out, tens of thousands\r\nof Shangtungese leaving yearly for the three rich Manchurian provinces.\r\nThe American suggestion that the Russian and Japanese railways in\r\nManchuria should be made international is possibly not so good a plan\r\nas to sell those roads to China with money loaned for the purpose,\r\nand clean Manchuria of Russian and Japanese troops. There seems no\r\npermanent reason why China should not run Manchurian railways and\r\nmines as well and as profitably as she has run the North China Railway\r\nand the Kaiping mine of Pechili province. To illustrate how Chinese\r\nofficialdom looks upon the general subject, I quote from Viceroy Liu\r\nMing Chuan’s memorial, approved by Li Hung Chang, written in 1893:\r\n“Japan attempts now and again to be arrogant--like a mantis when it\r\nassumes an air of defiance--and to despise China, and gives us no small\r\namount of trouble on the smallest pretext.”\r\n\r\nThe advance party has its critics in Japan. The Tokio _Nichi_, the\r\nOsaka _Mainichi_, the Tokio _Jiji_ and the Tokio _Yorodzu_ take the\r\nnation to task for attempting to compete with America’s navy. They\r\ncry out against the expansionists’ slogan of “Japan’s supremacy on\r\nthe Pacific”. Here is the _Yorodzu’s_ plaint against the heavy taxes\r\ninvolved: “Go to the hamlets and villages, and you find the sons of our\r\nsoil wearing the sad and worn appearance of the ‘man with the hoe’.\r\nAsk the shopkeepers and merchants, and they tell you that they are at\r\na loss to know how to make ends meet. So do small manufacturers and\r\nmen of moderate salaries, and in fact all who come under the general\r\nterm of the middle class. Why? What else but that their taxes are too\r\nheavy, and because the price of commodities has risen too high since\r\nthe war? The war has increased the wealth only of the contractors,\r\nspeculators, and a small group of millionaires, which accounts for the\r\nsudden rise of the prices of the necessaries of life. Thus the chasm\r\nbetween the poor and the rich is widening every day. What will become\r\nof the country if the government does not bend all its energies to\r\nthe recuperation of our national strength, which has been overtaxed\r\nduring and since the late war? The only course which the government\r\nshould follow at this critical moment is to curtail all the unnecessary\r\nexpenses of administration, most of all, those of the army and navy.”\r\nThis succinctly covers what volumes could not cover better. The average\r\nJapanese income is twenty-three dollars gold a year, out of which\r\none-fifth goes to taxes.\r\n\r\nFreight rates and tariffs are in some places as powerful as battleships\r\nand battalions in keeping out the commerce of a rival. When Japan and\r\nRussia rejected America’s proposition for an international control\r\nof Manchurian railways, so that the commerce of all nations would\r\npay the same duty and receive the same car supply in Manchuria,\r\nJapan and Russia made a secret treaty regarding Manchuria on July 4,\r\n1910, and another agreement in 1912. Among other points, it covered\r\ninterchange rates. The Russian railways can by high rates keep out\r\ncompetitive Japanese goods, and the Japanese railways can retaliate.\r\nOn non-competitive goods needed for local consumption, low through\r\nrates are accorded, Japan favoring the famous Harbin flour, timber,\r\nkaoliang spirits from the Harbin distilleries, and Amur salmon and\r\nfish. Russia accords low rates northward to Japanese (i. e., Fushun\r\nand Yentai) coal, cement, fresh food, etc. On export competitive\r\nsoybeans, for instance, by low rates Japan tries to coax Russian\r\nshipments southward via Dairen, and Russia makes a similar effort to\r\nroute Japanese-controlled beans via Vladivostok, but should a Russian\r\nshipper try to send ten miles in the direction of Japanese-owned Dairen\r\nhe would find the soy rate higher than all the five hundred miles to\r\nVladivostok.\r\n\r\nBy indirect methods, such as loans at low interest, rebated godown\r\ncharges, rebated rates, and what not (for where there’s a will there’s\r\na way) Japan can militate against the competition of American and\r\nBritish cottons, woolens, machinery, etc., in Manchuria. When the\r\nChinese junks on the Liao River compete in the open season for the\r\nsoy-bean traffic for Newchwang, the Japanese railways quote as low\r\na rate as five mills per ton mile to Dalny, as compared with the\r\nlowest rate in America of eight mills. Japan is a David when she\r\ngoes out to slay! Japan was the whole cause of the denial by China\r\nof an American-financed and constructed railway from Chin Wang Tao\r\nthrough Manchuria northward to Aigun. Yet she says she doesn’t mean\r\nto stay in Manchuria! She did not broad-gage Kuroki’s difficult\r\nAntung-Mukden railway recently in such a permanent way as to suggest\r\nthat she ever intended to retire or sell out, “treaties and conventions\r\nnotwithstanding,” to use the apt phrase of the London _Times_. Though\r\nAmerica would under no circumstances accept a square foot of land in\r\nChina or Manchuria, except on lease in an international municipal\r\nsettlement, America must protect her growing and potential trade in\r\nManchuria and in China, and that trade will always be withstood in one\r\nway or another by Japan. There is nothing now to go to war about, but\r\nthere will always be a good deal to argue about, and Japan, as well\r\nas the Manchus, knows a dozen ways of presenting a smiling evasion.\r\nHave you ever proposed a difficult question to a Japanese at a curio\r\nauction, and watched his face! We have all voted that he was a success\r\nin making language hide thought; a born diplomat.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese government debt outstanding is £300,000,000, as compared\r\nwith China’s debt of £93,000,000, and Japan’s industrials have borrowed\r\nprivately abroad an added £60,000,000.\r\n\r\n                         Japan’s Debt    Annual\r\n                             in £.

She and Russia compelled China to refuse America a railway\r\nfranchise in Pechili in 1910.\r\n\r\nWhat is the comparative strength of the American and Japanese\r\nnavies? The German specialist, Count von Reventlow, and the American,\r\nHomer Lea, who accompanied Sun Yat Sen to China as military adviser,\r\nthough he is not a military man, have in several books prophesied\r\nthat Japan will and can defeat America. Japan has four dreadnoughts,\r\nthe _Settsu_, _Kawachi_, _Aki_ and _Satsuma_, completed since the\r\nRussia War, but they have only half the gun-power of the ten American\r\nsuperdreadnoughts. Japan has eight battleships of the 15,000-ton\r\n_Mikasa_ type, including the salvaged and repaired Russian ships,\r\nagainst America’s thirty battleships of the first class. America can\r\ntherefore patrol the Pacific from a Philippine base as soon as she has\r\ndocks enough, and if America and Britain ever approximate on world\r\nquestions, the British navy can be drawn to the Atlantic and waters\r\nwest of Ceylon. Two things are sure: first, that America and Britain\r\nwill never fight each other; and second, that Britain’s and America’s\r\ncommercial and political policies in the East are identical in destiny.\r\nAs long as America maintains a two-power standard on the Pacific,\r\nthat is, two ships to one of Japan’s she need fear no opposition\r\nfrom Japan, and Japan has certainly nothing to fear from America,\r\nas China ceaselessly praises the altruistic and non-land-grabbing\r\npolicy of America over the world. It is true that Japan has an almost\r\nirresistible army, but sea power dictates, as Admiral Mahan’s brilliant\r\nbooks show. Japan whipped Russia because she controlled the sea. If\r\nAmerica controls the Pacific, the Japanese army could do nothing in\r\nKorea or Manchuria.\r\n\r\nNow, as to Russia, the navies of America and Britain pounding on the\r\nBaltic door, if necessary, as a last resort, could make Russia behave\r\nin Manchuria; but if this did not prove wholly effective, a reformed\r\nChinese army, trained by American and British officers, could in time\r\ndo to the Russian battalions that were left what Oyama’s, Nogi’s and\r\nKuroki’s regiments did. China should not yet be called upon to waste\r\nher money on a navy, as she has no interests for a century beyond the\r\ngreat countries of Turkestan, Mongolia and Manchuria, which America and\r\nBritain, with their navies, desire to enable her to retain. Britain and\r\nAmerica should have a persistent, consistent policy, and there will be\r\nno naval war, the whole world over; and Germany can reduce her navy\r\nand army charges, which are a curse to her people. If Germany wants\r\nto do a noble work, let her use her army to influence parliamentary\r\nand sociological reforms in tyrannical Russia, where men are blighted\r\nby the curses of opinion-paralyzing detectivism and oligarchism. If a\r\nconsistent, persistent policy is maintained there need no more be an\r\nAnglo-German feud on the Atlantic than an American-Japanese feud on the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nEngland needs a two-power navy because she has Africa, India and\r\nAtlantic Canada to defend. America needs a two-power Pacific navy\r\nbecause she has, as a foster mother of civilization, to help defend\r\nAustralia, South America, the Philippines, Pacific Canada and\r\nrepublican China. Looked upon in this way, a navy becomes a policeman,\r\nand not a swashbuckler. Money is going to be invested to develop all\r\nthese countries, and property should be protected, not looted. Those\r\nnations which have the most efficient naval police, and the most\r\naltruistic policies, are the nations which should patrol, and they are\r\nAmerica, Britain and possibly Germany, if the last nation advances, as\r\nit seems now to be doing, in parliamentarism to real representation.\r\nAmerica and Lloyd George’s Britain alone are essentially democracies,\r\nand therefore qualify in international altruism. With Britain’s control\r\nof the Suez Canal, and America’s ownership of the Panama Canal,\r\nefficiency is assured in these two nations effectively standing by\r\nto protect political progress and world commerce on a fuller and\r\nfreer basis than it has ever been. In amenability and high mechanical\r\nintelligence, Britain, America and Germany alone have qualified in the\r\nmanagement of navies.\r\n\r\nJapan and America will not fight on the Pacific, as Count von Reventlow\r\nand Homer Lea prophesy, but America will overbuild Japan instead. Japan\r\nhas been more carefully reading the new lesson taught by America and\r\nBritain that there must be no absorption of old China, and she is now\r\nthinking of a possible new rôle, as the interpreter of the East to the\r\nWest, and the West to the East. The head of the First Imperial College,\r\nDoctor Nitobe, the coiner of “Bushido”, is foremost in propagating this\r\nidea. Japanese school-teachers are most numerous in Chinese government\r\nschools, especially as teachers of English, in learning which, however,\r\nthey are not half so expert as the Chinese themselves. Doctor Nitobe is\r\na Christian.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Japanese War, Professor Nitobe, then with the Tokio\r\nUniversity, wrote a fanciful book on the theme, _Bushido_ (Japanese\r\npronunciation of “Wu Shih Tao”--way of warrior). It was quite on the\r\nstyle of Lafcadio Hearn’s apotheosis of the Japanese. Its effect in\r\nJapan was to produce some hysteria and not a little conceit. Foreigners\r\nwere led to believe that the Japanese must be right because they were\r\nreckless. The Japanese bureaucracy of the Choshiu, Satsuma and other\r\nclans used the fetish to entrench themselves. No one can say that\r\nJapan has real representative government. Her government is exactly\r\nthe government that Russia has. Her Diet is no more representative\r\nthan is the Duma. The ministry decides on the budget, and it is put\r\nthrough by steam-roller when necessary, and ready-made opinion is\r\ngiven to the press. There is no such thing as the British parliamentary\r\nsystem of the commons absolutely controlling supply bills, or the\r\nAmerican principle of the Lower House being finally supreme. The\r\nextensive press bureau which was established to popularize the Japan\r\nside of the Japan-Russia War, encouraged hara-kiri and telegraphed\r\nover the world in exaggerated terms the details of every hysterical\r\nand self-advertising suicide. For instance, if the warriors could not\r\ntake the fort, instead of trying again, they were to march up and blow\r\ntheir brains out before the moving-picture film, so to speak, leaving\r\na letter for the Mikado as follows: “We could not do what you asked\r\nus; it is our fault. Therefore in shame we hara-kiri. Bushido! Banzai,\r\netc.” This thing is being kept up to a degree, and as long as it is\r\nencouraged by the bureaucracy, constitutional government in Japan will\r\nbe postponed, the emperor being worshiped in his old office of pope of\r\nKioto instead of constitutional emperor at Tokio.\r\n\r\nI quote the following of many press despatches which constantly appear\r\nin the Japanese and world press: “To give his life as an atonement\r\nbecause the emperor of Japan had to spend an hour in a common\r\nwaiting-room, Moji Shijiro Shimidzu, a trainmaster, threw himself under\r\na train. Shimidzu had been in charge of arrangements for a journey\r\nthe emperor made from Kyushu, after witnessing the army maneuvers.\r\nThe imperial train was delayed by a derailment at a misplaced switch.\r\nShimidzu left a letter saying that he considered it his duty to pay for\r\nthe emperor’s embarrassment with his life.” The spectacular suicide\r\nof the immortal captor of Port Arthur, General Nogi, and his wife at\r\nthe time of the funeral of the Mikado Mutsuhito on September 13, 1912,\r\ncomes under the same category of godless savagery forbidden mankind by\r\nthe Sixth Commandment of Sinai. It is time for Japan to cease posing\r\nthrough her press bureau. We all admire her for many sane and grand\r\nthings done, and to tell the truth, we admire the Japanese people more\r\nthan their present system of a privileged government where only five\r\nmillions out of sixty millions enjoy the franchise. It is a government\r\nof the people, but not sufficiently a government for the people, and\r\ncertainly not a government by all the people, all of which conditions\r\nLincoln said should obtain if liberty was to be assured. That is the\r\naim of the whole world, and it has been accomplished now in England,\r\nAmerica, France, China, Portugal and Switzerland. The Shimidzus, who\r\ncommit suicide, do not exhibit patriotism but hysterical conceit,\r\nand the thoroughly organized Japanese press bureau, and the Choshiu,\r\nSatsuma, and other privileged clans, in their own best interests,\r\nshould discourage the nonsense; and instead of elevating the man as\r\na god in the Shinto shrine, they should exhibit him in the foyer of\r\nfools. Christianity teaches that there is only one being for whom we\r\nshould give our lives, and that anything else is idolatry. It is not\r\nthe emperor or the president whom we are to serve, but the emperor’s\r\nmen and women; the president’s men and women; that is, the state, and\r\na real emperor and a real president must, too, serve the state, which\r\nis all the people. Such is the modern logic Japan should teach her\r\npeople, and not the hysteria of Bushido. Japan is not ignorant of her\r\ndisabilities, and each of the Seiyukei, Kokuminto and Yushinkai parties\r\nare endeavoring to extend the educational system which Guido Verbeck\r\nfashioned for the favored Satsuma, Choshiu, Fujiwara, Gen, Tosa, Hizen,\r\nKago and other clans of five millions, to the forty-eight millions of\r\nagriculturalists, miners, factorymen and fishermen, and twelve million\r\nKoreans and Formosans. Success to Japan’s educational extension,\r\nis America’s and Britain’s hearty wish, for it “will calm a sea of\r\ntroubles”.\r\n\r\nJapan has been the first nation in the world to attack the land\r\ntaxation question, and Germany and Britain have followed recently,\r\na long way off, however, and America will probably also follow\r\nthe example. Until recently the large estates held by barons and\r\ncorporations have been taxed on the old feudal medieval system of an\r\ninfinitesimal valuation, while the small holder has been taxed on the\r\nfull selling value. This has now been changed, and large owners in\r\nJapan can not hold at little cost to await unearned increment. They\r\nmust work the land or sell it. Until this system is adopted the poor of\r\nthe nations will be decapitalized by tariff, food, clothing, building\r\nmaterial, head, war, permit, excise, export, subsidy, educational and\r\nother high taxes. Land values are about one-tenth what they are in\r\nAmerica, and the land tax is about eight per cent. on selling value. As\r\nin China under the Manchus, land in Japan is nominally the property of\r\nthe emperor. Perpetual leases can only be owned outright by Japanese\r\nsubjects, or by a company which is incorporated only in Japan. A\r\nforeigner in Japan can not own land, but his Japanese incorporated\r\ncompany can, as the land would then be at Japan’s command, Japan having\r\nno extraterritoriality exemption law favoring the foreigner, as has\r\nChina, in civil and criminal matters.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, the police are an arm of the central government\r\nand not of the municipality, which savors of despotism and Russia’s\r\nexample. There is therefore no really free press in Japan, for state\r\ntrials may not be reported or commented on. The police exercise a\r\ncensorship of news under their Marunouchi Club of Tokio. There could\r\nbe no Roosevelts, Wilsons, Bryans and Lloyd Georges in Japan as in\r\nAmerica and England!\r\n\r\nThey have their money trust question in Japan, for while there are\r\nthousands of small gathering banks, they all deposit in the trust\r\nbanks, which thus control the use of “other people’s money”, i. e.,\r\ncredit. These large banks, whose presidents confer in the meetings\r\nof the “Eel Society”, are the Bank of Japan, Yokohama Specie Bank,\r\nHypothec Bank, Japan Credit Mobilier, Hokkaido Colonial Bank, Bank of\r\nFormosa, Bank of Korea, and Mitsui’s Bank.\r\n\r\nJapan must have its Gifford Pinchot somewhere. She has taken quick\r\naction against states’ rights when conservation was endangered. It\r\nwas found that the provinces were selling water-power concessions to\r\nspeculators and dummies of the monopolies. The central government in\r\nJanuary, 1911, immediately suspended all provincial and colonial grants\r\nuntil a national survey could be made, and applicants looked into. It\r\nis proposed to harness several million horsepower of waterfalls on the\r\nSwitzerland, and not the Niagara plan (so as not to mar the scenery),\r\nwhich, with cheap labor, will be a great asset of industrial Japan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHINESE REPUBLIC]\r\n\r\nThat Japan has taken up officially the correction of complaints which\r\nhave been made in scores of books and hundreds of magazines on her\r\ntrickiness and lack of commercial honor is shown in the following\r\narticle by Minister of Commerce Oura, in the _Jitsugyo no Nihon_\r\n(Industrial Japan), written after his world tour, in which he praises\r\nthe sturdy honesty of old free-trade England. “I could not help\r\nregretting to find that in commercial morality Japan was too young and\r\nweak to be classed among the world’s foremost countries. Everywhere I\r\nwent I heard denunciations of and complaints against Japan. Japanese\r\nbusiness men not being particular about commercial morality,\r\npeople could not carry on business with our merchants with confidence.\r\nI soon felt ashamed on reflecting upon the fact that we Japanese had\r\ndefects, subject to attacks and complaints in the matter of commercial\r\nmorality. Our merchandise can not pass the customs authorities on a\r\nmere invoice, but is subjected to a rigorous examination. British\r\nmerchandise is always more substantial than is advertised. In short,\r\nBritish-made goods never fail to justify their advertised description.\r\nQuite the opposite is the case with Japanese goods. Complaints are\r\nraised against Japanese manufactures that they are not up to sample.\r\nIt is usual, for instance, for a layer of larger-sized fruit to be\r\narranged on top of the box. Instances of overcharging, and tricky\r\ninferior imitations of standard goods are common, and damage our\r\nreputation.” Confession and contrition are the parents of reform, and\r\nJapan is waking up.\r\n\r\nJapan worked her mines in 1911 to the following extent: Coal,\r\n16,000,000 tons, value, $30,000,000; copper, 120,000,000 pounds,\r\nvalue $15,000,000; pig iron, 60,000 tons, value, $1,500,000 (Kamishi\r\nand Sennin mines); zinc ore, 22,000 pounds, value, $300,000; lead,\r\n8,000,000 pounds, value, $250,000. The coal came from Japan mines only,\r\nand does not include the great product of the Fushun and Yentai mines\r\nin Manchuria. The copper was mined principally at the Kune, Kosaka,\r\nAshio and Besshi mines at a cost of nine cents, which is lower than\r\nthe American cost. Japan is exhausting the ore in the islands, and is,\r\ntherefore, looking to rich Korea and China for her supply of this war\r\nand industrial necessity. Her need of copper is another incentive to\r\nexpand politically.\r\n\r\nJapan is building a railway along the western length of the main\r\nisland, and will need $18,000,000 of railway equipment for it. She\r\nwill probably go abroad for half of this. Small as Japan is, this\r\nrailway will open up scenic and productive districts and add vastly to\r\nthe riches and strategic resources of the country.\r\n\r\nThe method by which Japan built the Kobe harbor piers out into deep\r\nwater was most modern. Cement boats, or caissons, one hundred and\r\nnineteen feet long, thirty-five feet high and thirty-four feet wide\r\nwere built on a floating dock (planned by a Westminster, England,\r\nconcern) at the shore. They were then conveyed to sea, the dock\r\nbeing sunk from under the cement boat. This latter was floated into\r\nposition, and gradually sunk with cement, rubble and sand in the\r\ncomparatively cheap but massive piers. A tonnage of 135,000 tons can\r\nbe warped alongside the dredged sea walls at one time. It is not so\r\nlong ago that everything had to be lightered out to the steamers in\r\nthe wind-swept roadstead of Kobe, and many days were lost waiting for\r\nsmooth water. The writer recalls being held at Kobe for eighteen hours\r\nduring a typhonic blow because no launch or sanpan could bring off\r\nthe passengers who had gone ashore during a calm. There are now no\r\ndelays. There are power-driven cranes and travelers, godowns, and every\r\nfacility for the quick handling of cargo. As at Montreal, Hamburg,\r\nLiverpool, Hongkong, etc., the government directly or indirectly\r\nassists, advances, or guarantees in securing the necessary harbor\r\nworks, railway connection and dock machinery at Kobe. Kobe is Japan’s\r\ngreat import harbor, as Yokohama is her export harbor. Tokio is to be\r\nan export harbor, as a long canal for 10,000-ton ships is now being\r\ndredged to Yokohama Bay.\r\n\r\nJapan’s petroleum is found in the Echigo district, straight across\r\nHondo Island from Tokio. The oil is excellent for illuminating and\r\nlubricating, and the industry, which is highly protected, employs 3,300\r\npeople, and pays twenty-five per cent. to the Nippon Oil Company. Fuel\r\noils and crude oils are brought from Sumatra, America and Mexico.\r\n\r\nMuch complaint was heard in England when the Grimsby steam trawlers,\r\nowned by syndicates, drove the small owner and the hardy fisherman from\r\nthe seas, affecting the recruiting of the navy, as well as driving a\r\nhardy independent class into a condition of economical and political\r\nservitude. Japan has copied this unfortunate example, and steam\r\ntrawlers have been introduced in her fishing waters. The government\r\npromises to control it before it seriously affects recruiting for the\r\nnavy.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese have gone into shirt-making, the duty on raw material\r\nbeing rebated when the shirts are exported. Foreign designs are copied.\r\nThe men receive nine dollars a month and the women six dollars. The\r\nhours are nine and one-half a day. The companies, like many of the\r\nJapanese industrials, grant a few holidays, and provide theatrical\r\nentertainments, moving-picture shows, baths and tea, none of which is\r\ncostly, but seem to keep the workers from realizing that their wages\r\nshould be three times what they are, even in Japan, for taxes amount to\r\none-third of the income.\r\n\r\nWinter clothing for the masses in general, and service clothing for\r\nthe navy, army, artisans, etc., under modern conditions of hard wear,\r\nhas become a stern problem in both Japan and China. Silk will not\r\ndo. Cotton will not answer in this field. Wool has been adopted, and\r\nthe gorgeous colors and texture of the Orient begin to vanish before\r\nthe requirements of a practical age. Two of the largest woolen mills\r\nin Japan are the Mousseline (Boshuku) Weaving Company, at Osaka, and\r\nthe Japan Woolen Company, at Kobe. Eighty per cent. of the total area\r\nof rocky Japan is not under cultivation, being ruined with tough\r\nbamboo grass, which seems impossible to eradicate, and which destroys\r\nthe delicate mouths and throats of sheep. Japan has, therefore, to\r\nimport her wool from Mongolia, Manchuria, England, France, Germany and\r\nAustralia. Not having a full supply of yarn mills, she imports yarn\r\nalso from England, France and Germany. Goat’s and camel’s hair is also\r\nimported from South America and Mongolia.\r\n\r\nThe movement for the conservation of timber has taken hold in Japan,\r\nreinforced cement poles, as well as creosoted poles, being used. The\r\nlargest creosote works are at Osaka, and the preserved wood is now used\r\nfor Japan’s famous light buildings, railroad trestling, ties, bridges,\r\netc. Japan has an exceedingly rich treasure forest (one of the world’s\r\nlast) east of the South Manchurian Railway, and also bordering the\r\nFusan-Mukden line. Much of the hard wood of Japan and her colonies is\r\nbeing brought to America for furniture-making at present.\r\n\r\nJapanese steamers will doubtless run to the east coast of America\r\nthrough the Panama Canal. Micki Shonzo talks of sending twenty of his\r\nvessels through. A Japanese line now carries nitrates, hides, salt,\r\nhorses, beef, wool, fish, grain, etc., from Chile, and coal, rice, tea,\r\nsilk, oils, bean cake, manufactures, matting, etc., to Chile. Japanese\r\nshipping in 1912 amounted to the enormous tonnage of 1,000,000, as\r\ncompared with 170,000 tons on the day before the Chinese indemnity was\r\npaid to Japan in 1895.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the rich dividends made by the Oriental Consolidated (gold)\r\nMining Company, at Unsan, in the Yalu district of Korea, made Japan as\r\nanxious commercially as diplomatically to secure Korea. This American\r\ncompany, with which Leigh Hunt was connected, and whose concession was\r\nobtained through the offices of United States Minister Allen, has\r\nmade in a concession 500 miles square 4,000 per cent. in ten years.\r\nOne hundred thousand dollars was put into the gold mining plant, and\r\n$4,000,000 has been paid in dividends, the mines themselves, instead\r\nof added capital, paying for their own development. The Unsan plant is\r\nlargely self-contained, having crushers, a foundry, machine shops, a\r\nfleet, a railway and lumbering plant, hospital and barracks. The mining\r\ncosts only one dollar and forty cents per ton, hand labor, the Koreans\r\nbeing the best miners in the Far East, owing to their docile patience.\r\nSome of the mines are one thousand feet deep. The Korean Exploration\r\nCompany (half American and half Japanese) has a gold mining concession\r\nat Chicksan, south of Seoul. The new terms that will probably be\r\nimposed on foreign mining by Japan will be at least twenty-five per\r\ncent. royalty on the net profits, machinery imported and ore exported\r\nto be duty and loti taxes remitted, respectively. If Japan can do the\r\nsmelting, of course ores must go there for treatment.\r\n\r\nIn Formosa the three largest Japanese sugar companies are the Niitaka,\r\nthe Taihoku and the Minami Seito (Southern Sugar Company), capitalized\r\nat about $2,000,000 gold each, with an output of 300,000 tons a year.\r\nJapan can increase this, and supply the world. The government grants\r\nsubsidies to the cane growers for fertilizer, and money prizes for\r\nmodel plantations, the high tariff against Hongkong, of course, being\r\na subsidy for the Formosan sugar mills, as far as supplying Japan is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nJapan has opened an electric-driven cotton mill, the Naigai Wata, at\r\nSuchow Creek, Shanghai, sending to America for the boilers, to Germany\r\nfor the dynamos, and to England (Oldham) for the spinning machinery.\r\nThe owners and foremen are Japanese, the workers Chinese. Eighty-five\r\nper cent. of the material is local grown, and fifteen per cent. comes\r\nfrom India in Japanese steamers. The finished product, mainly yarns,\r\nis sent up the Yangtze River and along the coast in Japanese steamers,\r\nand is admitted into Japan preferentially as far as foreign products\r\nare concerned. The Japanese are extending their ownership of cotton\r\nmills erected in China, for the Mitsui Bussan Kaisha has bought the Hua\r\nHsuan, the Shanghai and the San Tai mills at Shanghai, and the Wuchang\r\nSpinning Mill at Wuchang. The Mitsui Bishi Kaisha has bought the Chen\r\nHua mill at Shanghai, and the Nippon Mill Company has bought the Jih\r\nHsin mill in China. There is much food for thought in this situation.\r\nThe Japanese also own one-third of the largest translating press in\r\nChina, the Commercial Press of Shanghai.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese firm of Mitsui has established a refinery at Hankau to\r\nhandle the famous nuts of Szechuen province, which produce the oil\r\nknown as China wood oil. The Mitsui firm also handles the production\r\nof soy-bean oil in Manchuria, shipping the oil and the cake in great\r\nquantities in their own steamers to Europe and America. The Mitsuis do\r\ntheir own banking. The soy-oil is used for cooking, soap making, and as\r\na substitute in paints for linseed oil, which is becoming scarce. The\r\ncake is used as a milk food and a fertilizer in Europe and America. To\r\nwhat proportions the industry has grown can be judged by the following\r\nfigures: Newchwang (Chinese) shipped 230,000 tons of beans and 400,000\r\ntons of bean cake in 1911. Dairen (Japanese) shipped 450,000 tons of\r\nbeans and 300,000 tons of bean cake. Vladivostok (Russian) shipped\r\n250,000 tons of each. The soy-bean oil amounted to about 700,000\r\nhundredweight. This immense crop speaks eloquently of the richness of\r\nthe black soil of the three provinces of vast Manchuria. The bean\r\nis also now being planted in Szechuen province in the rows where the\r\nnefarious poppy once bloomed, and America is using quantities of seed\r\nin the southern states in connection with enriching land which has\r\nbeen impoverished by cotton. The soy-bean, being nitrogenous, adds to,\r\ninstead of taking from, the life of the soil. One ton of beans, besides\r\ntwo tons of soy hay, can be produced per acre.\r\n\r\nCanadian and South African railways may own hotels, express, telegraph,\r\ntelephone and land companies, but here is what the charter of the\r\nSouth Manchuria (Japan owned) Railway Company permits them to do:\r\noperate railways, cities, steamships, hotels, mines, electric light\r\nand gas plants, tramways, laboratories, laundries, shops, dormitories,\r\ngo-downs (warehouses), hospitals, Y. M. C. A.’s, schools, libraries,\r\nmills, selling agencies, stockyards, forests, sawmills, farms, kaoliang\r\ndistilleries, etc. This reminds one of the ancient East India Company’s\r\npowers before Warren Hastings was impeached, or of the ambition of\r\nIncoporator Dill in the palmy days of the incorporation laws of New\r\nJersey State before the Interstate Commerce Commission got into its\r\nstride.\r\n\r\nThe pernicious influence of the yoshiwara and the demi-monde in Japan\r\nand the Japanese settlements and colonies throughout the Far East, is\r\nfully covered in the tenth chapter of Price Collier’s _The West in the\r\nEast_. If the fire which destroyed the extensive, obtrusive yoshiwara\r\nquarter in the Susaki section of Tokio in 1911 had swept the whole\r\ninstitution away, womanhood throughout the world would not have the\r\ngrievance against Japanese society which it now has. Neither China\r\nnor India ever sank this low in morals, despite all the talk about\r\nconcubinage and slavery. The fault lies in the inherent weakness of\r\nreligion in Japan. The Buddhism and Confucianism (Shintoism) which\r\nJapan imported, have degenerated and lost soul in the exotic state.\r\nIf China needs Christianity, Japan needs it more. The Japanese women\r\nare delightfully vivacious; it is a pity so many should lose their\r\nself-respect. Possibly some of it substantiates the eternal teaching\r\nthat no nation can persistently ignore poverty and not suffer in\r\nmorals. The Japanese government is now doing something to remedy\r\nconditions and raise the moral tone. The fault lies largely with the\r\npeople themselves; too great a love of money and too little a love of\r\nreal religion, with the usual result that sacred womanhood is the first\r\nto be driven down at the wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nPRESSURE OF RUSSIA AND FRANCE ON CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nMany books have been written on the Russian advance to the Pacific,\r\nand they eventually induced Britain to hurl Japan on the aggressor.\r\nThese volumes include Putnam Weale’s fervid volumes, works by Lord\r\nBeresford, Senator Beveridge, Norman, Chirol, Colquhoun, Alexandria\r\nHosie, Younghusband, Krausse, Lord Curzon and others. That advance has\r\nbeen pushed back as far as the borders of Shingking, the southernmost\r\nof Manchuria’s three provinces, and out of the Korean Peninsula, but\r\nit is marking time in the other two Manchurian provinces of Kirin\r\nand Helung-Kiang, and in vast Mongolia, Jungaria and Turkestan. Some\r\ncritics have said that in having Russia pushed back from the Pacific,\r\nthe wave has backed up on Persia. The American one-time treasurer of\r\nPersia, Mr. Shuster, believes Britain has recently lost to Russia in\r\nthe buffer states of the Indian border. Certainly a new party has\r\nrisen in British diplomacy, whose writers are Maurice Baring, Hardinge\r\nand others, which is not at all Russophobic. Many believe that Russia\r\nintends to try again in Manchuria, and others believe that Japan will\r\nconcede to Russia the two northern Manchurian provinces; or again,\r\nthat Japan will occupy all Manchuria, and support Russia’s occupation\r\nof Mongolia and part of the Pechili province. As long as there is\r\noligarchic rule in Russia, there will be danger of the Russian advance,\r\nas the aristocracy wishes to keep an army employed, so as to use\r\nit when necessary on an ambitious Duma, or a people who demand real\r\nrepresentation in return for the tax privilege. Therefore Russia will\r\nfor many years press China at one spot or another, and how to checkmate\r\nthis pressure is one of Britain’s hardest problems, in which America is\r\ninvolved because of the Hay doctrine of the “non-partition of China,”\r\nwhich is the Monroe doctrine of the Far East.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1911 Russia disturbed the diplomats by sending a note to the\r\npowers that she intended to make a military demonstration against\r\nSungaria and reoccupy, as from 1871 to 1881, trade routes and frontier\r\ncities like Kuldja and Kobdo. Gullible China was induced to include in\r\nthe treaty with Russia at that time permission for Russian caravaners\r\nto cross Western China under Russian arms; to trade without paying\r\nduty, and to establish Russian “_imperium in imperio_” settlements.\r\nThe _Novi Krai_ of Harbin admitted that these extraterritorial\r\ndemonstrations in Far Western China aimed not so much at aggression\r\nin Turkestan as cajoling further privileges in Manchuria, such as\r\nnavigation on the Sungari, Russian settlements, mining and railway\r\nrights, etc. On another occasion, Russia is party to the rejection of\r\nAmerica’s proposal of the internationalization of Manchurian railways;\r\nor again Russia cites some secret coerced treaty and compels China to\r\nrefuse a franchise for an American railway from Chin-Wang to Aigun,\r\nor Chin-Wang to Kailar. Yet at the same time Russia is arranging with\r\nChina to drop a railway on Peking down from Irkutsk, and a railway from\r\nSemipalatinsk down on Jungaria and the headwaters of the great Tarim\r\nRiver. The Russian advance is not an extinct volcano; one never knows\r\nwhen it will be recrudescent somewhere. The party of Admiral Alexeyev,\r\nGeneral Spiridovitch, State Secretary Bezobrazov and Count Bobrinsky,\r\nis not dead at St. Petersburg. Russia is to-day moving 100,000\r\ncolonists a year into Siberia. She is double-tracking the Siberian\r\nrailway eastward to Lake Baikal.\r\n\r\nThe following memorial to the throne, written by Viceroy Liu Ming\r\nChuan, and approved by Li Hung Chang in 1893, reveals China’s knowledge\r\nof Russia’s deep designs: “We feel Russia’s grip on our throat, and her\r\nfist upon our back, and our contact with her is a source of perpetual\r\nuneasiness to our minds. When a quarrel occurs, we have to yield to her\r\ndemands.”\r\n\r\nThough no one can show why, land-rich Russia considers Mongolia,\r\nTurkestan, Ili, Jungaria, and two provinces of Manchuria, and even\r\nTibet, as her sphere. In the troubles of the revolution, during the\r\nlast months of 1911, harassed China felt Mongolia dragged from under\r\nher feet. The Chinese amban at Koren (Urga) was discountenanced, and\r\nRussia set up the Buddhist Lama as an independent ruler. Plans were\r\nalso laid to run a railway down from Kiakhta. The Mongolian princes\r\nfrequently receive presents to retain their sympathy and increase their\r\nobligations. Russia even made demands that China should withdraw her\r\ntroops from the outposts and discontinue colonization, for China is\r\nbeginning to learn the strategy of emigration. The building of the\r\nall-Russian link on the north side of the Amur River from Stretyinsk to\r\nKhabarovsk and Vladivostok, is going on apace at great cost, because\r\nthe Russians, in trying to settle the district, refuse to employ\r\nChinese, and have brought out 15,000 Russian railway laborers. The\r\nriver has too many shallows for successful transportation, and it would\r\nnot pay yet to dredge it. The _Chun Kuo Pao_, a native paper of Peking,\r\nwas so pusillanimous in its fear of Russia and Japan, as to recommend\r\nin 1910 the abandonment of Manchuria to save Mongolia. I have said\r\npusillanimous, but I might have said venal, as an illustration that\r\nRussian money may not neglect to seek power with some Chinese editors\r\nin the northern provinces.\r\n\r\nAmerica desired to keep Japan and Russia separated in Manchurian\r\naggrandisement, and instead Russia came to a secret amicable agreement\r\nwith her old enemy, Japan, in June, 1912. The American, Mr. Shuster,\r\nat the desire of Persia, was satisfactorily managing the customs of\r\nPersia, but Russia successfully intrigued for his retirement. On\r\nFebruary 22, 1912, in the Hall of the Nobility, St. Petersburg, the\r\nNationalist Party held a meeting to denounce treaties with America.\r\nCount Bobrinsky, the president of the Constitutional Conservative\r\nParty, stood up and called Ex-president Roosevelt the “enemy of\r\nRussia,” referring to the Portsmouth Peace Treaty. Plans were laid\r\nbefore the meeting showing how Chinese Turkestan could supply America’s\r\nplace in growing cotton for Russia. Several reasons were given why\r\nRussia opposed America. The real reason was that Russia does not\r\nlike America’s and Britain’s policy of the “non-partition of China.”\r\nThe aristocracy of Russia also hate the influence upon the Duma of\r\nAmerica’s and Britain’s system of budgets and armies controlled by\r\nthe lower house of the people. The oligarchy of Russia hate America’s\r\naltruism that would secure to growing China her ancient fields, mines\r\nand forests of Turkestan, Mongolia and Manchuria. The Chinese rely on\r\nAmerica’s altruism. There was possibly more than humor in the Tientsin\r\nshopkeeper’s sign: “All languages spoken; American understood.”\r\n\r\nThe Chinese bitterly remember the massacre at Blagovestchensk on the\r\nAmur River in 1900. When the Europeans were besieged in Peking, the\r\nRussians drove the innocent and unarmed Chinese inhabitants into\r\nthe river at the point of the bayonet. Many were drowned, and their\r\nbodies choked the landing wharves as they floated down-stream. Yet some\r\ninquirers ask why there should be an anti-foreign feeling in China!\r\nThe name of General Chitchegoff, who gave the murderous order, would\r\nlive in history yoked to Nero’s if we had writers to-day as able and\r\npatriotic as fearless Seneca and Lucan. If you are an American and\r\nask Chitchegoff in the place of his retirement why he did it, he will\r\nanswer: “Ask the Bureau, and blame the oligarchical system, not the\r\nmiserable agent.”\r\n\r\nThere was a time, too, when Prince Henri d’Orleans, Paul Doumer,\r\nGarnier, Leroy Beaulieu, Riviere, Loti, Petit, Bert, Imbere and\r\nBonheur wrote, when France, as Russia’s ally, had her aggressive\r\ndesigns on China. Hongkong, when I lived there, was haunted by\r\ncontinual nightmares after France took possession of Kwangchou Bay in\r\nKwangtung province. Since the French ran their railway from Haiphong\r\nto Yunnan City, French influence is strong in Yunnan province, and\r\nthe Szechuenese are looking for France’s hand at the headwaters of\r\nthe Yangtze River. In a sense this puts a barrier against the British\r\nattack on Western China from Burma, and the American attack from the\r\nPhilippines. While France at home and in Tonquin is a high tariff\r\ncountry, there is more confidence in the republican people of France\r\non the part of America and Britain than there is in the reliability of\r\nthe other mighty diplomatic competitors. Still French aggression is\r\npotential and not to be ignored, especially as France has in Indo-China\r\na colony of 735,000 square miles with a population of 34,000,000 people\r\nat the southern gates of old China. The heavily subsidized Messageries\r\nMaritimes mail line plies between Marseilles, Saigon and the ports as\r\nfar as Japan. I once sailed half around the world on one of their\r\nwhite boats and know their service to be excellent. At present the\r\nFrench monopolize the Yunnan traffic with their railway, charging in\r\naddition to the rates a high transit fee on bonded traffic. This is\r\ninternationally illegal, and is exactly what incensed Germany blew\r\nout of French diplomacy in Morocco at the muzzle of the _Panther’s_\r\nguns, when that vessel dropped anchor at Agidir one eventful morning.\r\nIn desperation, the Chinese tin miners of Kuo Chia (some of whom are\r\ncitizens of Hongkong) contemplate an opposition railway to Nanning, and\r\nthe old water route to Hongkong. The division of Siam between France\r\nand Britain is slowly going on, France having recently taken over one\r\nof the Shan States. To protect Singapore as a world equator gate,\r\nBritain must connect the Malay states with Burma, and in time take\r\npart of Siam. At one time France had a design of pressing her Tonquin\r\ninfluence through Western China, and meeting the Russian advance at\r\nPeking, but by the “entente-cordiale” France is now nearer to Britain\r\nthan Russia, and this is for the good of the world, including potential\r\nAmerican trade in the Far East. The Supreme Council of Indo-China\r\nhas recently raised a loan of $40,000,000 in France for irrigation,\r\ndrainage, agricultural and mining development, and extended railways\r\nand roads in Annam and Tonquin.\r\n\r\nChinese imperial influence in the last few centuries has not extended\r\nfar south of the Yangtze River. All through French China, that is,\r\nAnnam, Tonquin, Cambodia, etc., and in Siam and the Shan states (now\r\npartly absorbed by British Burma), in the old days there were hundreds\r\nof petty kings and princes (a king to a hill in that land of hills),\r\nwho themselves, with the exception of the brave and intelligent Black\r\nFlag Leader, Liu Jung, were really adventurers, or descendants from\r\nChinese adventurers from Kwangtung, Kwangsi and Yunnan provinces. Send\r\na Chinese to America, and he tries to become a monopolist because of\r\nthe ambitious example set before him; send him to British Singapore,\r\nand he strives to become a contractor with designs on knighthood;\r\nsend him to Annam or Tonquin, and in the merry old days he became a\r\nswashbuckler king, and strutted upon his ant hill. The French had to\r\npension or dethrone a hundred of these “royal” fellows from the Si\r\nKiang valley. The dethroned one said: “As for me now, back to the\r\npirate waters of the West River, and the admiralty of a snake-boat\r\nfleet.” They have all recently turned up in the pirate waters of\r\nKwangtung province, and during the revolution of 1911–12 made endless\r\ntrouble for the gunboat fleet of Britain, America and China, operating\r\nin the interests of civilization and trade, from Hongkong and Canton.\r\nOne brigand named Luk captured the famous Bogue forts of Canton on\r\nMarch 12, 1912.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman takes Paris with him wherever he goes, and as one\r\nindication I found him in all the cafés that lined the red streets\r\nof Indo-China, dropping his absinthe on ice in a long glass, though\r\na physician would shudder at the risk taken in such a terrifically\r\nhot and humid climate. To balance “pidgin English” he has taught\r\nthe Annamese “petit negre.” He has brought his costly Parisian\r\narchitecture, as in the Palais, the Opera, the Cathedrals of Saigon,\r\nHanoi and Haiphong. Since 1873 the five provinces of Indo-China, with\r\nan area larger than Texas, have cost the French $150,000,000 for\r\nmilitary expenses. The trade last year was $50,000,000 imports and\r\n$30,000,000 exports. The colony is only beginning to exploit its great\r\nwealth, especially in coal at Hongay, Kebao and Laokai in Tonquin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nSOME FOREIGN TYPES IN CHINA, AND THEIR INFLUENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mainstay of Chinese revenue, and the main security as yet for\r\nforeign loans, is the National (formerly Imperial) Customs of five per\r\ncent. duty ad valorem. The organization was started at Canton in 1859\r\nby Sir Robert Hart, an Armagh Irishman who was transferred from the\r\nBritish consular service. He served as head from that year until his\r\nretirement with a fortune of $500,000 in 1910. Sir Robert Hart lived\r\nin princely style at Peking and managed the service honestly. He has\r\nbeen criticized for taking so large a reward from straitened China by\r\nmembers of the India civil service, who are satisfied to retire on\r\n$1,000 a year after even more arduous service. In 1901 Sir Robert Hart\r\nwrote his book, _These from the Land of Sinim_. He was a brilliant\r\npropagandist for things Chinese, the most popular Occidental who ever\r\nserved China, though he was not so heroic a figure as “Chinese” Gordon.\r\nSir Robert Bredon was next in office, and in 1911 Sir Francis Aglen\r\nwas put in charge. The son of an English clergyman, a well equipped\r\nsinologue, trained under Sir Robert Hart, Mr. Aglen is a thorough\r\nleader of this great work, which includes loan departments, lighthouse\r\nservice, a cadet school, a pension bureau, and an internal revenue\r\norganization to a degree. As British commerce is the largest in China,\r\nbeing nearly four times as large as America’s trade, the British name\r\nthe head of the customs service. Many Americans, Germans and French are\r\nalso employed, and a thorough knowledge of Chinese and its dialects is\r\ninsisted upon by Sir Francis Aglen.\r\n\r\nIn the region about Shanghai and Nanking, the name of “Chinese” Gordon\r\n(General Charles) still lives for his victorious leadership of Li Hung\r\nChang’s army, which crushed the Taiping rebellion, and saved the Manchu\r\nthrone for the time. General Gordon had many bitter quarrels with Li\r\nHung Chang, insisting that assassination and murder must not follow a\r\nvictory. That the rebels of 1911 in this same region did not forget\r\nGordon’s precepts was shown by their leniency under great provocation,\r\nafter capturing Nanking from the Manchus. No foreigner who has aided\r\nin forming the ten divisions of China’s Northern army has had the\r\npersonality or exercised the influence that Gordon did, and in the\r\ngreat trial of the revolution and the mutinies of 1911–12 the army\r\nshowed frequently that no strong personality had inspired the men with\r\na fixed purpose, honor or patriotism.\r\n\r\nAbout 1869 a nephew of President Van Buren, John Sheffield Van Buren,\r\nwent out to Yokohama as an assistant in the consular office of his\r\nuncle. He was soon in Hongkong as agent of the Pacific Mail, Occidental\r\nand Oriental, and Toyo Kisen Kaisha trans-Pacific steamship companies,\r\nand was in touch with the Chinese of that great crown colony for\r\nthirty-three years. He had an intimate knowledge of China, and trained\r\nmany of its commercial men who have risen high in the commercial and\r\ndiplomatic affairs of the new republic. In Hongkong he was looked\r\nupon as one of the ablest minds that linked the West and the East.\r\nHe was devoted to Southern China, developed its trade, dry docks\r\nand shipping, and formulated China’s first trans-Pacific steamship\r\nline, the Chinese Merchants’ Steamship Company of 1903. The famous\r\nChinese guilds of Kwangtung province looked upon him as a sage, and\r\nsought his aerie retreat over Robinson Road on the cliff for many a\r\nconference under the swaying punkahs. He was a very tall thin man,\r\nwith a long countenance, great eyes, and a slow, full, round voice. It\r\nwas impossible to irritate him to heated expression. Like the mills\r\nof the gods, he ground slow but exceedingly fine. He used to bemoan\r\nthe fact that Americans who managed Oriental companies generally do so\r\nfrom America, before being first experienced in the Orient, and he was\r\na strong advocate of the British system of moving partners who would\r\nserve their seven-years term in the Orient, seven at home and then back\r\nto the Orient again. He was decidedly in an inferior field in commerce.\r\nIf American diplomacy had been steadier in the East, freed from the\r\nspoils system, his mentality and training were perfectly fitted for a\r\ngreat American minister at Peking, or a great consul-general at Canton.\r\nHe was a deep student of the Filipino, as well as the Chinese, but was\r\naltogether in favor of the latter. He was more pessimistic perhaps\r\nthan was justified regarding what America will be able to do with the\r\nFilipino and the Philippines. A thorough student of the Far East, and\r\nthe representatives of all nations who gathered there, smiling like\r\nBuddha in his vast but reserved knowledge, nothing irritated him so\r\nmuch in his official duties as listening to the conversation of the\r\nofficial American globe-trotter, who dropped into Hongkong for a week,\r\nand then drove contrary opinions down the throats of such sinologues\r\nas he was, and wrote books, most of the prophecies of which remain as\r\na joke when compared with events. There was one American senator and\r\nanother American official who wrote books of Far East prophecies whose\r\n“cocksureness”, like that of the Kanaka surf-rider, used to strike to\r\nthe core of the resentment of this usually placid Solon of the East,\r\nwho died in the terrific heat of the Red Sea in 1910, worn out with his\r\nlong life near the equator, and never having written the books that\r\nwere within him, and which he really owed the world. His sister married\r\nan Austrian nobleman. The family homestead was at Englewood, New\r\nJersey, and on his mother’s side he was connected with the Sheffields\r\nand Phelpses, of Yale College memory.\r\n\r\nThere have been other notable Americans who served in China. Colonel\r\nJohn S. Mosby, the Confederate guerrilla leader, was consul-general at\r\nHongkong from 1878–85, and General E. S. Bragg, of the Wisconsin Iron\r\nBrigade of the Civil War, was consul-general at Hongkong from 1902–4.\r\nThe general had a sharp wit and tongue, and is known world wide for\r\nthese two phrases which got into domestic and international politics:\r\n“We love Cleveland for the enemies he has made;” and, “You can as\r\neasily make a citizen of a Cuban as a whistle out of a pig’s tail.” The\r\ncontretemps can be understood when it is explained that the general was\r\nat the time consul at Havana. Like the Arabs of Longfellow, after this\r\nincident and the receipt of some mail from Washington, he “folded his\r\ntent and silently stole away” for Hongkong! General Bragg, at Antietam,\r\nwas approached by General Gibbon’s aide, with orders to push the enemy\r\nas long as it was safe, and the former’s famous reply was: “It has been\r\nd---- unsafe here for the last half hour. Forward again, Wisconsin.”\r\nMr. Rounsevelle Wildman, author of _China’s Open Door_, and editor of\r\n_Overland Monthly_, consul-general at Hongkong, where he amused the\r\nstaid Britons by his energetic efforts to sell his worthy book, lost\r\nhis life aboard the Pacific Mail steamer _Rio_, which sank with all on\r\nboard just outside the Golden Gate, San Francisco. Daniel Webster sent\r\nhis son Fletcher as secretary of the famous Cushing Commission, which\r\nvisited Hongkong, Canton and Macao. Secretary William H. Seward later\r\npassed over the same waters, and I have seen Admiral Greeley, of Polar\r\nfame, picking out the great war secretary’s steps at Wanchi, Hongkong.\r\nThe Tibet traveler and author, A. H. Savage Landor, I knew at Hongkong.\r\nSome of us believed his thrilling tales of escape after torture and\r\nsome of us were cynical. He was a worn man then, grateful for favors\r\nthat are usually accorded to the traveler, an enthusiast, a student of\r\nthe Western Chinese, and a courageous fellow.\r\n\r\nIn 1911, America, Britain, Germany and France arranged to loan China\r\nabout $100,000,000 for railways and new currency. A neutral financial\r\nadviser was found to be necessary, and President Vissering, of the\r\nDutch Java Bank, was agreed upon by the four nations, with Japan\r\nfavorably impressed. If the loan agreements go through, and when\r\naffairs assume their normal course in China, Doctor Vissering will have\r\nopportunity to leave his mark in a wider sphere in the Far East. Mr.\r\nHillier has long represented the British financial interests in Peking;\r\nMr. Straight, the American; and Doctor George E. Morrison, of the\r\nLondon _Times_ staff, has been adviser to both imperial and republican\r\ngovernments at Peking.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable imperialists who ever came to China was\r\nPaul Doumer. He was a French newspaper man, and came East as consul,\r\nlater becoming governor of Indo-China, which he sealed to France with\r\nan iron hand. He made Haiphong, Hanoi and Saigon remarkable centers\r\nof civilization, sanitation, music, art, architecture, commerce and\r\nFrench imperialism. Cost was nothing to him. He seemed to make or\r\nhypnotize money after he had hypnotized governments and financiers\r\nwith his eloquence and ambition. He formed Legionary troops and held\r\na strong navy in the East. He brought the great Messageries Maritimes\r\nsteamship line from Marseilles to Saigon. He grasped Kwangchou Bay in\r\nKwangtung province, and made Hongkong tremble for her prestige over\r\nCanton and the southwest, her old imperial sphere. Then he dreamed\r\ngreat visions of imperialism, as Rhodes was dreaming in Africa, Curzon\r\nin India, A. Colquhoun in Burma, Kitchener in the Soudan, and some\r\nAmericans like Roosevelt and Taft in Panama and the Philippines. He,\r\n“_le petit_ Paul Doumer,” would build a six hundred-mile railway, much\r\nof the right of way where men had never been before, from Haiphong\r\nto Yunnan, in the heart of Southwest China, turn the British flank\r\nat the headwaters of the Yangtze River, and link Yunnan, and some\r\nday Chingtu, with Marseilles and Paris. What if fever, one hundred\r\nbridges in fifty miles, a cost of $100,000 a mile of road, and a little\r\ntraffic had to be conquered, he would build to the center of China,\r\ndividends or no dividends. By 1910 he and his men had done it. The\r\nBritish, fired by Colquhoun and Curzon, raced him from Burma, but he\r\nhas beat them by fifteen years. The Chinese do not love the French,\r\nand they are building from Yunnan to Nanning to reach Hongkong; but\r\nit is largely French for the present at Yunnan. Hongkong and Mandalay\r\nhave been flanked. The Chinese would have preferred the Americans, or\r\nthe British, who do not covet Oriental land. The French aim to push\r\nthat railway up to Chingtu, and cut China in half. Yunnan City, on its\r\nhigh plateau, once the farthest from Peking and civilization, is now\r\na center of remarkable modernity, the Chinese emulating the French\r\nin lighted streets, water-works, factories, modern prisons, trade\r\nschools, uniformed police, and a provincial army and arsenal of modern\r\ntype. If you ask how has Paul Doumer influenced China, _circumspice_\r\nat Yunnan City. Before Paul Doumer came East, following the dream of\r\nempire, if you had been asked which was the last city of China that\r\nwould adopt progress, you would have said “inaccessible Yunnan,”\r\nwhereas it has been almost the first. Doumer’s most notable book on\r\nChina is _L’Indo Chine Française_, with the emphasis on the _Française_!\r\n\r\nFor two decades the name of Mr. Rumor (I shall call him that for\r\nthe purposes of this sketch), of Hongkong, was synonymous with the\r\nrocket which seemed to have become a fixed star. He was a Canadian,\r\nborn in the little riverine town of Belleville on the St. Lawrence.\r\nAdventure found him in Hongkong, a clerk in the Public Works Department\r\nof the Colonial Government, at a child’s salary in a land costly\r\nfor the foreigner. The Chinese were beginning to use wheat flour in\r\nplace of rice, which had become valuable for export. Rumor acted as\r\ntheir adviser during lunch hours, when the fervid sun of the Orient\r\nburned up the tamarind’s shade and fried the papaw’s thick leaves. In\r\ntime he himself quietly imported consignments of Oregon flour. His\r\nChinese compradore was honest and divided the profits, though the\r\ncompradore did all the work. Rumor grew richer, and became an agent\r\nfor Northern Pacific American mills. As the years passed, the able and\r\nhonest Chinese compradore brought him orders sufficient to load many\r\nfull ships that breasted the slow waves of the Pacific. The Chinese\r\ncompradore lived plainly, and saved enough money to become a financial\r\npower in the great imperial colony. Rumor then went into military,\r\nnaval and diplomatic society, built one of the finest aerie mansions\r\nin the Far East on Hongkong’s peak of palaces near the unique tram on\r\nBarker Road, where a thousand feet of picturesque cliff fell from its\r\nfoundation. He imported Kentucky saddle horses and racers, and at great\r\nexpense put Canadian sheep on the foothills of old China to see if they\r\ncould conquer the bamboo grass. He owned a steam yacht and a sailing\r\nyacht, gave musicales to the military of the garrison station at both\r\nhis down-town chambers on the Praya and at his mountain château, and\r\nentertained an American governor of the East who became a president.\r\nHe was a handsome man, the mirror of fashion and manners in the\r\ncosmopolitan colony. His was the easy bearing of those who associate\r\nwith princes and know their standing. Like Beau Brummel, of Piccadilly,\r\nhe could make a griffin’s social fortune by being seen walking with him\r\ndown the Praya. Stories were told of his recklessness in hours of play.\r\nHe was a dashing character, altogether. He made annual trips to the\r\ngreat cities that line the equatorial belt of the world and to capitals\r\nof the North. He seemed to have tapped the mines of Eldorado.\r\n\r\nAt last, he would add fame to riches. Hongkong was about to enter\r\nthe great educational arena in the awakening of the Far East with\r\na splendid university. Hormusjee Mody, the Prince of Parsees, gave\r\nthe land. Who would give the endowment and thus perhaps secure a\r\nknighthood? Why, Rumor, who at last was truly popular and not envied\r\nalone, for he was now about to do something for others than himself. In\r\nthe meantime he had started a Chinese flour mill at Junk Bay, Hongkong.\r\nHe would startle the whole economic world, as Harbin did, by grinding\r\nChinese grain on the spot, and he would import less Australian and\r\nOregon flour. There seemed to be no end to Rumor’s extension or the\r\nglamour which he cast over his compradore and the Chinese bankers, as\r\nwell as the American mills. Many tried to emulate him and steal his\r\ntrade, or imitate his “chops” on the flour bags; but the Chinese, “olo\r\ncustom”, clung to Rumor, who alone expanded, came, saw and conquered.\r\nSan Francisco was shaken by an earthquake, and New York by a financial\r\npanic. The twin waves went round the world, and met in Hongkong harbor\r\none dark night, just as Rumor, purposely unaccompanied by a white\r\nman, was returning in his yacht _Canada_ from his flour mill at Junk\r\nBay, all the long miles of the famous harbor to the landing under his\r\nmountain palace and the university site. No one knows much about it,\r\nexcept that the crew at last missed him overboard. The tidal financial\r\nwave had swamped him. He could ride its crest no more in splendor.\r\nThe great university will bear many names, but probably not the name\r\nof Rumor as its endower when the accounts of the estate are balanced.\r\nThree Chinese, of Singapore, stepped forward and endowed the university\r\nwith nearly $500,000 gold, although they were at the same time holding\r\nup the hands of the exhausted Chinese republican revolution.\r\n\r\nSir Matthew Nathan came to Hongkong as governor from hot and feverish\r\nNigeria. Hongkong is a moist hot place, very near the direct sun of the\r\nequator, and men who wish to live long go slow in the luxuries of work,\r\nliquor, etc. It is a good place to send your victim, as David disposed\r\nof Uriah “in the forefront of the hottest battle”. Sir Matthew’s\r\nenthusiasm was to be every inch a “knower” (mandarin) of the people,\r\nand a governor. He wore his staff out. He was up at unseasonable hours\r\nin addition to his regular duties. He worked as hard on the hot Praya\r\nas another man would on cool Piccadilly in March. Every emergency and\r\noccasion found him at hand, whether an awful fire, a new railway, or\r\nthe launching of a great ship. The memorable typhoon of September,\r\n1906, struck the unprepared colony which has been visited so often\r\nwith these circular hurricanes. Sir Matthew seemed to superintend the\r\nrescuers at every spot of the long beach and harbor. When the steamboat\r\n_Hankow_ holocaust occurred in October he worked, axe and arm, with the\r\nfiremen. Little wonder that he died, really of exhaustion. He was a\r\ntypical example of the grand old British civil service in China. He was\r\nheroic, unselfish, tireless, sympathetic, a man whose example lives to\r\nfire China with zeal and altruism.\r\n\r\nDoctor C. D. Tenny, an American educator, has been connected with the\r\nAmerican Peking legation and has served on many American political\r\nmissions, such as the inspection in 1912 of Doctor Sun Yat Sen’s\r\ngovernment at Nanking. His influence in the northern provinces with\r\nYuan Shi Kai has been great. Pai Yang Technical University at Tientsin,\r\nand Paoting Fu College, both Chinese, have known the worth of his\r\nguidance, and therefore they stand as models. Doctor W. A. P. Martin,\r\nthe dean of American Presbyterian missionaries for thirty years, has\r\ndone almost a similar work in the north in connection with the Chinese\r\nTungwen College and Peking University, and moreover, Doctor Martin is\r\na famous translator of American books into Chinese. Wells Williams, of\r\nthe American Peking legation, is famous not only because his father\r\nwrote that noble basic work, _The Middle Kingdom_, but for his own work\r\nas a diplomat in America’s diplomatic advance in the Far East. The\r\nAmerican minister at Peking, Mr. W. Rockhill, carefully and bravely\r\nexplored Mongolia and Tibet, and wrote a diary of his travels in the\r\ndebatable lands where Russia, Britain and China face one another.\r\n\r\nDoctor H. H. Lowry, for many years president of the Methodist\r\nCollege at the Hata Men gate, Peking, has long exercised a strong\r\ninfluence upon Chinese officials and students. He is a man of great\r\ntact, enthusiasm, wisdom and scholarship, and is known both to have\r\nenlisted Yuan Shih Kai on the side of religious tolerance, and to have\r\nconfirmed him in modern educational methods. The American Methodist\r\nbishop, J. W. Bashford, of Shanghai, is a mighty militant man with the\r\nsouthern republicans. The students adore him. The patriots of young\r\nChina worship him. Fiery zeal, idealism, and the courage of a lion\r\nare characteristics of this influential, learned and sacrificing man.\r\nDoctor F. D. Gamewell, of Peking, is a Methodist missionary who has\r\nbeen in China for thirty years. He is world-famous for his engineering\r\nskill in directing the fortification of the legations in the awful\r\nsiege of 1900. He is a man of great physical courage, calmness of mind,\r\nand sanity of judgment, and is a tower of influence among the Chinese\r\nofficials. He hails from Hackensack, New Jersey.\r\n\r\nC. W. Kinder, a Briton, of the Kaiping mines, built the first\r\nlocomotive, and instituted the successful railway and mining policy of\r\nNorth China. He has done nearly as much in technical education at the\r\nTongshan shops and school. For thirty years he has led the Chinese in\r\nmechanical development, and has reconciled officialdom to modernity\r\nin utilitarian matters. Mr. Kinder’s assistant has been Mr. Alston.\r\nThe British engineers who have established China’s great railway\r\ndevelopment are Messrs. Collinson, Tuckey and Pope. The engineers in\r\ncharge of the Hanyang smelting and mining development are the Germans,\r\nRuppert and Leinung; and the German, Herr Dorpmuller, constructed the\r\nnorthern section of Tientsin-Pukow railway. Doctor G. E. Morrison, the\r\nAustralian at Peking who represents the London _Times_, has long held\r\nthe world bound to his prompt despatches regarding Chinese politics,\r\nof which he is past master. With all the currents which have been\r\ndragging and crossing in Manchu Peking, a man who can steer the ship\r\nof prophecy must be a master hand, and Doctor Morrison is a master\r\nhand, both in acquiring and digesting difficult news. His book, _An\r\nAustralian in China_, speaks for itself.\r\n\r\nThe influential and typical authors who have lived in China for long\r\nterms are known by their books and by the prominent positions they\r\nhave held. The genial and humorous Professor Parker, of Manchester\r\nUniversity, was a British consul at Fuchau, Canton, etc. His books\r\nreveal his deep knowledge of antiquity, religion and the language.\r\nProfessor Giles, of the University of Cambridge, was British consul\r\nat Ningpo. No man has done more to reveal the East to the West. His\r\nbooks speak for themselves. My old friend, Dyer Ball, with whom I sat\r\nfor many a year while we questioned Chinese emigrants in the musty old\r\nharbor office at Hongkong as to whether “they sold themselves like a\r\npig” (the Chinese idiom for contract slavery), and with whom I have\r\ntaken many a walk over Hongkong’s noble peaks, was for thirty years in\r\nHongkong’s civil service as registrar, protector of the Chinese, etc.\r\nHis text-books on the dialects of the language are well known, and\r\namong others his book, _Things Chinese_, is an encyclopedic authority.\r\nThe late Professor Legge, of Oxford, lived for many years at Hongkong,\r\nwhere he translated the Chinese classics. He opened a window which let\r\nthe light of Cathay shine out on our surprised Western world. Shanghai,\r\ntoo, has had its many authors. The American, Jernigan, wrote _China in\r\nLaw and Commerce_, a most illuminating work in a sadly neglected field\r\nwhich is coming into prominence with the modernized times. Canon Moule\r\nwrote brilliantly of his surrounding provinces, and many other Shanghai\r\nmen have taken up a gifted pen, notably the late Robert Little, who\r\nfor sixteen years was the scholarly editor of that sapient authority,\r\nthe _North China News and Herald_. Mr. Little was succeeded by the\r\neminent editors, Montague Bell and Owen Green. The _National Review_,\r\na brilliant illustrated weekly, is ably conducted by Mr. Walter\r\nKirton, of Shanghai, and G. B. Rea, M. E., conducts the famous _Far\r\nEastern Review_, of Shanghai. Professor Hirth, of Columbia University,\r\na German, served in Hart’s Chinese customs service, and has written\r\ninteresting books on his experiences. Sir Henry Blake, of Hongkong,\r\nmarried into the British court, governor and author, was a ponderous\r\ntype, once of the stern Irish constabulary, an ideal disciplinary\r\nofficer, a splendid type of the strong Briton not unlike Lord Cromer\r\nin temperament. Up at Mukden, Doctor J. Ross, of the Scotch church,\r\ndoes wonderful things in authorship, medicine, education and theology\r\nfor the Manchus; and over all the land the scholarly, indefatigable\r\nAlexandria Hosie, one time British consul at Newchwang in its strenuous\r\ndays, wanders, collecting accurate trade data and making maps for the\r\nguidance of diplomacy, trade and letters. Two of his books are, _Three\r\nYears in Western China_; _Manchuria, Its People and Resources_. Chester\r\nHolcomb, interpreter and secretary at the American legation, Peking, in\r\nthe eventful Boxer days, wrote an illuminating book, _The Real Chinese\r\nQuestion_. I regret that he died while in America in 1912.\r\n\r\nRussia has her own scholars and explorers like Prejevalsky, whose\r\nworks should reach us in greater abundance than they do. Doctor W. M.\r\nHayes, the American Presbyterian, guided Yuan Shih Kai in founding his\r\nProvincial College at Paoting Fu. Stewart Lockhart, up at Wei Hai\r\nWei, has been governing that crown colony for Britain for many years\r\nand writing books. I knew him at Hongkong as the brilliant colonial\r\nsecretary, and indefatigable student of the exceedingly difficult\r\nlanguage and written character, worthy in his scholarship to bear the\r\nname of Scott’s son-in-law. Under Lockhart serves Johnston, author of\r\n_Lion and Dragon in North China_, who was one of our Hongkong cadets,\r\nSir Henry Blake’s secretary, and an Oxford man. All of these men, and\r\nscores more whom we knew, have been interesting types of the West\r\nin China, all the while they were, in their own way, interpreting\r\nChina to Europe and America. The Chinese have copied, and will copy,\r\ntheir faults and their virtues. Until lately one has seldom heard of\r\na defalcation by a Chinese. In the rubber panic of 1910 at Shanghai,\r\nthe Chinese taotai, Tsai Nai Huong, absconded, owing several million\r\ndollars, and financial China was shaken to its foundation. Whether the\r\nfault was ignorance or cupidity, no one can say. He was given the loan\r\nby the government to sustain the Chinese banks which were beginning\r\nto fail because of speculation in the rubber estates (and the estates\r\nthat existed only on paper!) of Malaysia. Would that more Chinese were\r\nadmitted to Manila, where they might note the methods of the leaders\r\nin the splendid paternalism now being developed there in manufacture,\r\nbuilding, education, road-making, hygiene, and every department of\r\nprogress and government.\r\n\r\nDoctor C. W. Mateer, who founded the leading American Presbyterian\r\nUniversity, situated at Wei Hsien in Shangtung province, is perhaps\r\nbest known as the translator of the New Testament into northern\r\n(Mandarin) Chinese. President A. J. Bowen, an American, of the great\r\nNanking Union University (Presbyterian, Methodist, Disciples), wields\r\na vast influence with the rising republicans and officials of Middle\r\nChina. Doctor Paul W. Bergen is president of the great Presbyterian\r\nCollege at Wei Hsien, Shangtung province. These men have vast power\r\nto influence the East in favor of the West, if the western business\r\nmen were not so parsimonious in providing funds for the colleges and\r\nhospitals in China. An endowment of $30,000 is given for a university\r\nwhere at least $100,000 should be given, because the missionary of the\r\neducational and medical class is the pioneer of trade. Cure a Chinese,\r\nteach him modern methods, and he will in his gratitude favor western\r\ntrade and intercourse. The debt American and British expansion owes\r\nto the missionary educator and medical man is greater than is owed\r\nto the man behind the gun, or the diplomat behind the flag and the\r\nprotocol, who, while they serve, often serve harshly. Doctor J. H.\r\nJudson is president of the American Presbyterian College at beautiful\r\ncultured Hangchow, and has great influence with the sons of officials\r\nand leading merchants of Southern China. The most influential and\r\ninteresting foreigners in China are the medical missionaries. There\r\nare too any names to quote, but all the church boards in America and\r\nBritain will furnish scores of names, if the inquirer is interested in\r\nthe men and women who are doing the forward work of his denomination.\r\nNext to these men come the translators and educators, the great\r\ncollege presidents and professors in China, like Doctor Pott, of St.\r\nJohn’s, Shanghai. Missionaries of the old type, diplomats, merchants,\r\ntravelers, treaty port editors, etc., are also performing their\r\ninteresting part as types in interpreting the West to the great East,\r\nand ten thousand Chinese are gathered around each, eagerly watching\r\nevery act and listening for every word. As one travels into different\r\nsections of China, some foreign name or personality stands there for\r\ngood or ill, more prominently than the native’s own pailoo arch,\r\nbefore the eyes and in the speech of the awakening people, who are\r\nweighing the types of men who, coming among them, have excited their\r\nemulation in most and their revulsion in some cases. No course of\r\nreading can afford more material for thought than the hundred books\r\ndevoted in recent years to things Chinese, and written by various\r\ntypes of foreigners during their long sojourn or exile in Cathay. The\r\ntraveler who goes to Africa generally writes about animals, for they\r\nseem to be more interesting than the old races that are there, but the\r\nsojourner in China writes, not about monkeys, but about men and women\r\nwho have been thinking in a continuous civilization which is at least\r\n4,000 years old. As to the Chinese monkeys, there are a few of them in\r\nSzechuen and Yunnan provinces but since there are 400,000,000 men and\r\nwomen in China to write about, if one cares for works on monkeys, one\r\nmust go to the literature on Africa! As for me, I confess to partiality\r\nfor Cathayan literature because of its absorbing humanities and many\r\ntypes, which distinctly facet interesting differences.\r\n\r\nNo foreigner in China was as accurate in his prophecies of coming\r\npolitical events and massacres as the Roman Catholic Bishop of\r\nPeking, Monsieur Favier, who recently died. This was partially owing\r\nto his remarkable judgment, and partially owing to his wide sources\r\nof information, as Catholic converts are four times as numerous as\r\nProtestant converts. Monsieur Favier, ahead of events, was the best\r\ninformed foreigner in China regarding the “Boxer” movement of 1900,\r\nand if his advice had been followed by the legations, the foreigners\r\nwould have left Peking for the coast before the siege was instituted.\r\nHe did not intend to leave himself, as he felt it to be his duty to die\r\nif necessary with his converts. Every one has admired his successful\r\ndefense of the Pei Tang cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe following prominent American educationalists in China visited\r\nAmerica in November, 1912, and spoke for China at the World’s Oriental\r\nCongress at Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts: Vice-president\r\nWilliams, of Nanking University; President Edmunds, of Canton Christian\r\nCollege; President Goucher, of the University of Chingtu, and Professor\r\nC. W. Young, of Union Medical College, Peking. It was regretted that\r\nPresident Sheffield and Doctor Arthur H. Smith, the eminent author, of\r\nthe American Congregational College of North China, were not present.\r\n\r\nLate advices state that the Chinese government at the close of 1912 has\r\ntaken into its employ in the administration of the salt gabelle, J. F.\r\nOiesen, a Dane of Tientsin; and as legal adviser, Monsieur Recouse, a\r\nprominent Belgian. Wherever Belgians are used, it is generally for the\r\npurpose of hiding the hands of France, and sometimes of Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nTHE MANCHU\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the republicans rebelled against the dynasty, the following was\r\nthe indictment issued to the world’s press, and signed by Foreign\r\nMinister Wu Ting Fang and Assistant Foreign Secretary Wen Tsung Yao,\r\nat Shanghai. Wu, all the world knows as the Jefferson of the new\r\nrepublican China. Wen is a very able modern lawyer, who made his name\r\nas a resourceful amban at Lhasa.\r\n\r\n    1. Incapacity.\r\n\r\n    2. Reactionary.\r\n\r\n    3. Benighted and barbaric.\r\n\r\n    4. Opposes modern knowledge, science and industry.\r\n\r\n    5. Favors a closed door; stultified national service.\r\n\r\n    6. Opposes government by the people; favors Manchus who are\r\n    only one in about one hundred of the population.\r\n\r\n    7. Pensions a vast horde of non-working Manchus.\r\n\r\n    8. Barbaric against life and property, when opposed.\r\n\r\n    9. Constitutional promise insincere.\r\n\r\n    10. Manchus hold back world-progress.\r\n\r\n    11. Gave away Chinese territory.\r\n\r\n    12. Despised the Chinese and prohibited intermarriage.\r\n\r\n    13. Taxation without representation.\r\n\r\n    14. Haughtily refused to adopt Chinese system of three names,\r\n    thus maintaining a separate society.\r\n\r\n    15. The Manchu has no literature, and, therefore, is a\r\n    barbarian.\r\n\r\nThis Chinese Declaration of Independence first appeared at length\r\nin the _North China Daily News_, of Shanghai, on November 15, 1911.\r\nSimilar complaints had been brought against the Manchu when the Taiping\r\nrebellion opened in 1850. The Manchus were a hunting tribe whose\r\npreserves lay along the wooded foothills of the Long White Mountain\r\n(Chang Pai Shan) northeast of Mukden. The region is well described by\r\nJames in his _Long White Mountain_ (1888). The chieftain who whipped\r\nthe Manchus into shape for conquest was Nurha-Chu. He drilled their\r\ncavalrymen from 1559 to 1626. From scattered tribes, dwelling in felt\r\nmichung-tents, he organized them as a Manchu horde with an ambition.\r\nThe Great Wall was not erected against the Manchus, but against the\r\nancient ancestors of Tartar cousins of theirs. The Manchus themselves\r\nerected a palisade-barricade against their cousins, the Khitans, on the\r\nwest. It ran from Shan Hai Kwan, on the Pechili Gulf, where the Great\r\nWall meets the sea, northward five hundred miles until it reached the\r\nSungari River and encircled Kirin. I think it is difficult now to find\r\nany part of the stockade, but I believe that James and Younghusband\r\nfound evidences of it in their exploration of Manchuria about 1886.\r\nThe North China Railway embankment west of Mukden absorbed part of the\r\nhistoric mounds. The Manchus had no script. Nurha-Chu gave them one\r\nbased upon the Mongolian, which in turn was copied from the vertical\r\nSyriac. This showed that Nurha-Chu talked with traveling priests who\r\nhad come down the Tarim valley. You will note the character on the\r\nback of any Chinese cash coin, which has a square hole in the middle.\r\nObtain one of these coins, for they will be minted no more, and they\r\nare historic; in fact, the oldest coin known. They are the oldest as\r\nfar as the Chinese face is concerned; the Manchu merely put the name of\r\nthe reign in Manchu on one side of the Chinese coin, ten of which\r\nexchange for one American cent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright, 1913, The Bobbs-Merrill Company.\r\n\r\n  A splendid view of the Great Wall, at its most picturesque angle.\r\n    Note tree-denuded mountains, the cause of the awful floods and\r\n    consequent famines.

The Manchus\r\ninformed this civil service that they could hold their places if they\r\nadopted the Manchu style of hair-dressing, which was done, and in time\r\nManchu yellow instead of Chinese blue became the official dress of\r\nhonor. The Chinese women were unconquerable. They never adopted the\r\nManchu style of dressing the hair over the ears, or of not compressing\r\nthe feet. The Manchus refused to adopt the Chinese system of using\r\nfamily names first, making a three-named system, as Li Hung-Chang. The\r\nManchus used merely their double names, as Na-Tung, but their family\r\nnames were entered on the roster of one of the eight military banners.\r\nGradually the Manchu garrisons bullied the Chinese out of their walled\r\ncities, and the Chinese had to build a second wall around the suburbs.\r\nThe events and dates of Manchu history, as it affects their own Ta\r\nChing (Great Pure) and foreign (Fung Kwei) civilizations, are told\r\nshortly, as follows:\r\n\r\n  The Manchu Tien-Tsung overthrows the Ming King\r\n    Hwai Tsung and occupies Peking                                1643\r\n\r\n  Tea brought to Europe in English ships from Canton              1660\r\n\r\n  Kang-Hi, greatest and most artistic Manchu Emperor,\r\n    ascends throne, Christianity almost established               1661\r\n\r\n  Galdan, Prince of Jungaria, conquers Kashgaria and\r\n    becomes supreme in Central Asia                               1678\r\n\r\n  First treaty with European power (Russia)                       1689\r\n\r\n  Commerce with East India Company begins at Canton               1680\r\n\r\n  Yung-Ching ascends throne; anti-Christian                       1722\r\n\r\n  Jesuits expelled                                                1724\r\n\r\n  English send first man-of-war, _Centurion_, to China,\r\n    English being active at Canton, Ningpo, etc.                  1742\r\n\r\n  First American vessel, _Empress of China_, from New\r\n    York, Captain Green, reaches Canton, China                    1784\r\n\r\n  First American Consul, Major Shaw, at Macao,\r\n    China                                                         1786\r\n\r\n  Philadelphia opens China trade with ship _Alliance_             1788\r\n\r\n  Boston opens China trade with ship _Massachusetts_              1789\r\n\r\n  Earl Macartney’s mission arrives at Peking, throwing\r\n    light on the Empire, which appeared to contain\r\n    4,402 walled cities, population 333,000,000,\r\n    the Tartar and Manchu army being 1,000,000 infantry\r\n    and 800,000 cavalry.

The Manchus themselves are to blame for the\r\nlack of respect shown the throne and dynasty in the last fifty years.\r\nPrince Chun might have taken the throne himself, but in fear of the\r\ncabal of jealous princes he named his child Pu Yi. This system of\r\na long regency had several times been put in force by the Manchu\r\nintriguer, especially by the Dowager Tse Hsi with Kwang Hsu. When the\r\nlatter grew up and asserted himself, he was destroyed, and another\r\nchild, this Pu Yi, named as his successor. The same murderous and\r\nunstable system has been followed in putting up a new child Dalai\r\nLama at Lhasa every few years, the old Dalai being informed that “it\r\nis time for him to pass his soul on to a new incarnation”. He can\r\ncommit hara-kiri or be murdered. The Chinese people felt that there\r\nwas no emperor to worship and obey, but rather a cabal in usurpation\r\nat Peking, and an irreligious cabal at that. From the time of the Chou\r\nfounders, 1200 B. C., to make light of the sacrifices by letting a\r\nchild do a man’s duties, was a cardinal sin.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Manchu in his long rule at Peking debased the idea of\r\ngovernment by women and eunuch favorites. No one concerned will ever\r\nforget the power of the notorious eunuch Li Lien Ying at Peking in the\r\nyears which led to the coup d’état of 1898, when reformers and emperor\r\nwere crushed to the ground. This notorious “grafter” really shared the\r\nthrone power with the Dowager Tse Hsi, and the Emperor Kwang Hsu was in\r\ncontinual disgrace. The Manchus knew that it was unconstitutional to\r\nhonor eunuchs. During the minority of Kang-Hi, the greatest emperor of\r\nthe Manchus, the regents degraded the eunuchs and had the law engraved\r\non iron plates of one thousand pounds each. Why did not Tse Hsi observe\r\nthis law during her long regency? Did she think the people would not\r\nremember and that her successor, Prince Chun, and the dynasty would\r\nnot suffer? Because of her hospitality when at the close of her life\r\nshe permitted her portrait to be painted for the St. Louis Exposition\r\nby a talented American woman, and when she entertained several of the\r\ncharming legation ladies at Peking, books have been written by her\r\nguests, in their womanly kindness of heart, and one book by a talented\r\neditor friend of mine at Hongkong, palliating her offenses as a tyrant,\r\na reactionary and a murderess. The long cold history of British and\r\nAmerican diplomacy; the domestic history of China during her period,\r\nthe Boxer siege, the written testimony of the Emperor Kwang Hsu, her\r\n“dummy” policy, the experiences of the great reformers, including\r\nYuan; her persecution over the whole world of Kang Yu Wei and Sun Yat\r\nSen by her spy system; the national newspapers, the publications of\r\nChing-Shan, her household controller; the statements of the American\r\nsecretaries of her chief viceroy, Li Hung Chang; the republican\r\nrevolution and Declaration of Independence of 1911, are all insistent\r\nthat egotism and reaction sat closest to the heart of this powerful\r\nwoman; that she belonged to the class of Catherine and not to the class\r\nof Elizabeth or Victoria. If this was the character for seventy years\r\nof the leader of the Manchus, what was the character of the followers!\r\n\r\nOwing to the Manchu’s lack of an art sense, he has neglected the\r\nbeautiful bridges and broad roads left by the Sung dynasty; the\r\nartistic towers left by the Tang dynasty; the gorgeous pagodas left\r\nby the artistically incomparable Ming dynasty; and the fine canals\r\nleft by the Mongols. There should, perhaps, be less surprise over the\r\ndifference in the intellectual powers of the Manchu and the Chinese.\r\nThree hundred and fifty years ago the Manchu was only a hunter, a\r\nwarrior and fisherman, like his cousins, the Buriats and Tungus up\r\nin Siberia to-day; whereas for immemorial centuries the Chinese has\r\nbeen a merchant, a scientific agriculturalist, and a scholar, and has\r\nalways earned his own living without benefit of government subsidy or\r\nclass privilege in any way, which have enervated the Manchus of to-day\r\nand yesterday. The reaction of the patient Chinese in the October,\r\n1911, rebellion against the Manchu conqueror was natural. The surprise\r\nis that it was withheld for three centuries. The Manchus have never\r\nmingled with the Chinese. All the large cities, even to distant Canton\r\nand Yunnan, 1,200 and 1,400 miles away from the center of power, have\r\nseparate walled Manchu cities, or Tartar cities as they are generally\r\ncalled, which were taken from the original Chinese. In an effort to\r\nappease the complaints of insurgents, the Regent Prince Chun in 1909\r\nrecalled the edict which until that late year prohibited Manchus from\r\nmarrying Chinese.\r\n\r\nLike all minorities that try to intrench their privileges, the Manchu\r\nis much of a “snob”. It is not uncommon to hear this sneer at Peking\r\nregarding the Chinese women of the south: “Oh, she’s a woman from\r\nthe southern provinces; you can’t expect manners from her.” The fact\r\nis that the Chinese women of Nanking, Hangchow, Soochow, Canton and\r\nother southern cities have more refined manners than the rough-riding\r\nManchus, the daughters of raiders. The wearing of the queue and the\r\nskull cap is a Manchu custom, imposed in the seventeenth century upon\r\nthe conquered Chinese. One of the first things the Han republicans did\r\nin the October, 1911, revolution was to cut off the queue which they\r\ndeclared was a sign of servitude to the dynasty which they were trying\r\nto displace. The head-dress of the Manchu women shows the bunching of\r\nthe hair over each ear instead of behind the head and on the neck, as\r\nis the Chinese custom. The Manchus do not deform the feet, nor paint,\r\nboth of which have been Chinese customs. The gown of the Manchu women\r\nis longer than that of the Chinese women, the latter showing the\r\ndivided skirt, or rather wide trousers. Other distinctive Manchu styles\r\nare the jewel-buttons, denoting rank, worn on the peak of the conical\r\nofficial hat; the peacock’s feather worn at the back of the hat; the\r\npeacock design in embroidery; the yellow riding jacket.\r\n\r\nManchus drink kaoliang spirits in place of rice samshu. Their battle\r\nflags have been triangular instead of oblong. The peculiar daylight\r\naudiences given by the throne to the grand councilors and viceroys\r\nshowed the fear of publicity, and a recognition of estrangement from\r\nthe people. They seemed to think that a throne that was surrounded\r\nwith a good deal of mystery, exclusiveness, smoke of incense and\r\ndarkness was stronger than a throne that was clearly outlined in the\r\nlove of the people. A curious worship of the Manchu leaders, who are\r\nmore superstitious than religious, is that of the fox. The great Fox\r\nTemple at Mukden, the ancestral temple of the dynasty, is famous. The\r\nChinese leaders have never been as crude as this in their grossest\r\nsuperstition. The Chinese, especially the hard-working southerners who\r\npay most of the taxes, have objected to the pensions accorded to a\r\nmillion Manchus gathered under the eight banners, and quartered, with\r\nthe privilege to bear arms, in walled cities, barracks and arsenals\r\nthroughout the land. In the fall of the Manchus, intrenched so long\r\nbehind a spy system, control of taxation, trade routes and judicial\r\nappointees, all oppressive systems and tyrants should take notice\r\nthat however intrenched they may seem to be against the people, the\r\npeople will in the end become supreme, with a long, long memory of the\r\nwrongs that they have endured against their will, and the theme of\r\n“Restitution” on their tongues. To quote the words of Wu Ting Fang, the\r\nJefferson of China, well known to Americans and Britons: “The hand of\r\nthe people is now at the plough, and they must of necessity push on to\r\nthe uttermost end of the furrow.”\r\n\r\nThe books written on Manchuria include James’ _Long White Mountain_;\r\nSir Francis Younghusband’s _Narrative of Travels in Manchuria_, 1896;\r\nHosie’s _Manchuria, Its People, Etc._; Howarth’s _Origin of the\r\nManchus_; Doctor J. Ross’ _Manchus or the Reigning Dynasty_; E. H.\r\nParker’s _Manchus in China_. Doctor A. Wylie translated the Manchu\r\ngrammar and the _Tsing Wen Keung_. These are all British writers.\r\nProfessor I. Zacharoff compiled a Russian-Manchu dictionary and wrote\r\non the Manchus in 1875, and Von Mollendorff composed a Manchu grammar.\r\nIt is possible that in exile from the throne the Manchus may revive\r\nthe little literature and language that they possess; or, champion\r\nintriguers that they and their race are, Prince Tuan, Prince Su, the\r\nTsai Princes, General Yin Tchang and others may continue to plot from\r\nJehol, Kalgan, Urga, Mukden, Dalny and other places of exile. Manchu\r\nliterature consists of only two hundred and fifty works, nearly all of\r\nwhich are translations of the Chinese classics.\r\n\r\nWhat greater proof was ever given of the irreconcilable differences\r\nbetween the Manchus and Chinese, than the ominous silence of the\r\nChinese members of the momentous meeting of the Grand Council called\r\nby the Empress Dowager Tse Hsi at Peking on June 16, 1900, to decide\r\non the final attitude toward the “Boxers”. When the Manchus showed an\r\ninsane determination to destroy their dynasty, the Chinese members by\r\nsilence assented, and the republican rebellion of 1911 was only the\r\noutward manifestation of the spirit of the silence of 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nCHINA’S ARMY AND NAVY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe revolution of 1911 made known to the world the Chinese generals\r\non the northern and southern sides, who were really able to command a\r\nmodern army in action as well as in field maneuvers. Generals Li, Ling,\r\nHo, Hwang, Hsu, etc., were the leading southerners. Generals Feng,\r\nChang, Chao and Sheng were among the leading northerners in active\r\nservice. All of these are Chinese. The much-heralded Manchu generals\r\nproved a failure, and few of the old-style Tartar generals, like Chiang\r\nand Chen of Pechili province; Na Yen, of Kalgan; Tuan, of the Red\r\nBanner Corps; Prince Su, of the Peking Gendarmerie, etc., were called\r\nupon to serve in the field. The latter decidedly had the ferocious\r\ntemperament, but they lacked the knowledge of modern tactics. General\r\nChao Ehr Feng, conqueror of the Tibet mutiny and the Dalai Lama in\r\n1910, an effective old-style general, was cooped up in Chingtu City at\r\nthe opening of the rebellion in September, 1911. General Yin Tchang,\r\nthe Manchu general-in-chief; Brigadiers-General Ha and Liang, who\r\nvisited America in 1910; Major General Ho; Prince Tsai Tao, the Manchu\r\nminister of war; Prince Yu Lang, of the dapper gray Imperial Guards,\r\netc., never got much nearer the war than the point of mobilization, and\r\ntheir private car on the Hankau-Peking railway, with the engine pointed\r\nnorthward! The military princes of the royal blood, Tsai Pu, Tsai Jin,\r\nDuke Ling, Prince Pu, etc., all kept their dress uniforms innocent\r\nof the dust of field and the grime of powder. Prince Tsai Hsu, royal\r\nadmiral of the navy, kept aboard his luxurious steam yacht which the\r\nKiangnan Dock Company of Shanghai built for him, and sulked away from\r\nAdmiral Sah’s service fleet, which was making a last dash to cut the\r\nrebel’s left flank between Wuchang and Hankau.\r\n\r\nThe modern Chinese army dates back to 1894 and the defeat in the\r\nChina-Japan War over Korea. Viceroys Li Hung Chang and Yuan Shih Kai\r\nwere bent on drilling an effective service. Chiefly German and Japanese\r\ninstructors were hired, though there were a few other foreigners also.\r\nGeneral Upton (U. S. A.), of Civil War fame, once made a trip to China\r\nand planned with Viceroy Li Hung Chang the establishment of a Chinese\r\nWest Point in the north, which has been begun in the Pei Yang Military\r\nCollege at Tientsin. Emperor William personally instructed General Yin\r\nTchang in Germany. An army of Imperial Guards and ten divisions, mostly\r\nterritorial for facility in recruiting and mobilizing, was whipped into\r\nshape chiefly in the northern provinces, and twenty other divisions\r\nwere partly formed as provided for by the famous Army Edict of April\r\n16, 1906. Modern arsenals, headquarters offices, field maneuvers, Red\r\nCross, foreign instructors, the Pei Yang Military College, etc., were\r\nall provided for. The old-style provincial turbaned troops allotted to\r\neach viceroy, and the pensioned soldiers of the eight Manchu banners\r\nwere not all disbanded. They were quartered among the 4,000 walled\r\ncities. No conscription was necessary, as the men seemed anxious to\r\nserve for the wage, or the promise of six dollars a month. The plan\r\nwas to keep the men three years with the colors, three years with the\r\nreserve, and thereafter for ten years with a landwehr on the German\r\nplan. By 1900 the new army was not cohesive, or the reactionary\r\nempress dowager, Prince Tuan, General Tung Fu of Kansu, and Yu Hsien,\r\nof Shangtung, would have wiped out the foreigners in the legations and\r\nAdmiral Seymour’s international relief expedition at Tientsin. When\r\nthe 1911 rebellion opened, the Eighth Division joined the republicans\r\nat Wuchang, and earned immortal glory. Their brothers of the Third\r\nDivision opposed them at Hankau. The Ninth Division of Shangtung and\r\nKiangsu territorials held Nanking for the imperialists, but the Kiangsu\r\nBrigade of that division later deserted. The Twentieth Division of\r\nManchurian territorials at Lanchow Camp near Peking earned immortal\r\nglory by sending up to the National Assembly and the throne nineteen\r\nconstitutional articles which they said had to be signed before they\r\nwould war for the throne. This was _lèse majesté_ with a vengeance! The\r\nGuards Division was at Peking, where it stayed, watching the hoards of\r\nbullion and sycee more than constitutional articles! The Sixth Division\r\nwas in Shansi province. The First Division of Manchu troops, and the\r\nSecond and Fourth Divisions at times shuttlecocked along the railway\r\nbetween Hankau and Peking. The Fifth Division was at Tsinan, capital of\r\nShangtung province.\r\n\r\nHad China’s army not been territorial, the rebellion might never\r\nhave got into swing, because it would have been impossible to have\r\nintrigued with a mixed Eighth Division. Again, had China’s army not\r\nbeen territorial, President Yuan could have used the Third, Fourth,\r\nSixth and Twentieth Divisions at Peking in March, 1912, to suppress\r\nthe mutiny, whereas these divisions remained in sympathy with the\r\nFirst Manchu Division and the Imperial Guards Division, and refused to\r\nobey the constitutional head of the government at a climacteric time.\r\nA mixed army is not easily mobilized, but when mobilized it is more\r\namenable to discipline, and the ignoring of local feeling in view of\r\nthe larger aims of statesmanship. England’s, Germany’s and France’s\r\narmies are territorial. Italy’s and America’s regular armies are not.\r\nAmerica’s vast militia army, however, on which she mainly depends, is,\r\nof course, territorial.\r\n\r\nGeneral Yin Tchang, who had much to do with organizing the effective\r\nten divisions of the northern army, is a graduate of Peking University.\r\nHe served five years in the Austrian infantry, and as minister to\r\nGermany, at Emperor William’s request, he enjoyed that unusually able\r\nand enthusiastic monarch’s private instruction in army matters. In 1900\r\nGeneral Yin Tchang came in contact with the allied forces at Tientsin,\r\nand held his retreat together well enough to elicit much admiration.\r\nGeneral Yin and the regent, Prince Chun, both visited Hongkong in 1901\r\nand there gained sympathy from us all for the great promise which\r\nthey showed in guiding the New China. Yin Tchang’s excellent idea was\r\nto take the provincial armies away from the viceroys, and make the\r\nnew divisions answerable to the Board of War (Ping Pu) at Peking.\r\nPrince Tsai Tse’s, the finance minister’s plan, was to inform each\r\ngovernor what amount he was to send to Peking as the province’s share\r\nin maintaining a central army. There was considerable conflict over\r\nthis issue, many southern governors saying that they paid for two\r\narmies, one modern army which was held in the north, of which they\r\nnever received their allotted division or brigade, and the old-style\r\nprovincial troops which they had to maintain to preserve order. General\r\nHa Han-Chang, a Chinese by blood, came next to Yin in drilling the new\r\narmy. He is also a Pei Yang graduate, and trained with the Japanese\r\narmy. General Liang-Pi, a Manchu, had an experience similar to that\r\nof General Ha, before accepting command of the First Brigade. None\r\nof these men is like Tieh-Liang and the other well-known old-style\r\ngenerals, strong in classics but weak in tactics. They reversed the\r\norder. General Li Chin Hsi at remote Yunnan City raised and drilled an\r\nexcellent division. The division at Canton went all to pieces before\r\nthe republican troops of General Wu Sum, but the Shansi divisions were\r\neffectually held together by General Sheng Yun, a Mongol, who later\r\ncaptured the Tongkwan pass, which commands the road from the west to\r\nPeking. Many soldiers of the southern divisions, in the first few\r\nweeks of the revolution, fired from the hip, as they were not used to\r\nthe recoil on the shoulder. They, of course, soon did better. One of\r\nthe best and most popular marksmen of the Singapore Rifle Team which\r\ncompeted at Bisley in 1910 was Sergeant Tan Chow Kim, a Cantonese\r\nChinese.\r\n\r\nThe name of Frederick T. Ward should be linked with “Chinese” Gordon’s\r\nin connection with Chinese military records. General Ward, born at\r\nSalem, Massachusetts, lost his life in the service of China. He\r\norganized and led the only great army that China ever had before\r\n1906. His name stands linked with Gordon’s as the maker of the “Ever\r\nVictorious Army,” the conqueror of the Taiping horde.\r\n\r\nA modern rage for dull-colored new uniforms has struck gorgeously\r\ngowned old China. I shall recite an amusing instance. In the fall\r\nof 1911 a band of rebels organized in Sining, in far-western Kansu\r\nprovince. They chose a boy of fifteen as their prophet leader because\r\nhe bore peculiar birthmarks. He was given the fanciful name of Savior\r\nof the Land (Chu Shih Waang). The generals reported that the new force\r\nshould wear modern uniforms of cotton. The stores were swamped with\r\norders, and every bolt of foreign cotton was immediately bought up, no\r\nmatter what its design. The Imperial Guards wear gray, and the other\r\ndivisions wear blue and khaki.\r\n\r\nAviation was introduced in China (really Indo-China) at Saigon on\r\nDecember 1, 1910, by the Holland-Frenchman, Vanderborn. He was followed\r\nlater in the year at Shanghai by the American, “Bud” Mars. The first\r\nChinese aviator was Fug-Yu, who was trained in America, and who\r\nexperimented at the Lanchow (east of Peking) camp in 1911. During the\r\nrevolution a number of Chinese students took lessons in aviation in\r\nAmerica and left for the rebel front. Had the war continued it was the\r\nintention to destroy Peking by dynamite dropped from air-ships. Both\r\nSun and Yuan are to be congratulated that this necessity was obviated\r\nby diplomacy.\r\n\r\nChina’s antiquity, vast population and warlikeness have been brought in\r\nquestion by some writers. That she had a vast population as far back\r\nas the third century before the Christian era is proved by the army\r\nrecords. The Ts’in clan, operating under their celebrated General Peh\r\nKi, slew and beheaded in 293 B. C. 240,000 Hans; in 275 B. C. 40,000\r\nNgwheis; in 264 B. C. 50,000 Hans; in 260 B. C. 400,000 Chows, and in\r\n256 B. C. 90,000 more Chows, thus exterminating the imperial ancestral\r\nclan which instituted the sacrifices and held the sacred tripods. Szma\r\nTsien, the historian, writing at 100 B. C., says the allies lost a\r\nmillion men in fighting this Ts’in clan. After the Christian era the\r\nChinese took fewer plural wives and fought fewer wars. Twenty years\r\nago, an emperor who raised the despised military class to the equal of\r\nscholars, farmers and merchants, would have been decapitated. Compare\r\none of the military edicts of the regent, Prince Chun, dated Peking,\r\nApril, 1911: “We are of the opinion that militarism is the first thing\r\nnecessary to the upbuilding and preservation of a nation.”\r\n\r\nSome of the military proverbs of the old Chinese are:\r\n\r\n“The best general thinks of wise strategy before blind courage.”\r\n\r\n“A mob does not make a regiment, for a trained man is as effective as a\r\nscore untrained, and much easier to save in a retreat.”\r\n\r\n“A good general can’t blame defeat on bad soldiers, for a good general\r\nhas no poor regiments.”\r\n\r\n“The pike only grabs the duck’s lame leg that can’t kick.”\r\n\r\n“The battle may not be for a cycle of years, but the soldier must awake\r\nfor it every day.”\r\n\r\n“A dog that bites the hardest shows his teeth the least.”\r\n\r\n“A whisper can bring on a war.”\r\n\r\n“Keep your good cannon masked, and your bad guns on brave parade.”\r\n\r\n“If the enemy doesn’t know your weakness, you are not weak.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the man behind the gun more than the gun, and the man inside the\r\nfort more than the wall.”\r\n\r\nChinese literature is not without its stirring war songs, which\r\nbreathe not only the pathos of the suffering of those at home, but\r\nthe sacrificing patriotism of the ranks. The following is quoted from\r\nConfucius’ Odes, B. C. 551:\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE SOLDIER\r\n\r\n  I climbed the barren mountain,\r\n    And my gaze swept far and wide\r\n  For the red-lit eaves of my father’s home,\r\n    And I fancied that he sighed.\r\n\r\n  I climbed the grass-clad mountain,\r\n    And my gaze swept far and wide\r\n  For the rosy light of a little room,\r\n    Where I thought my mother sighed.\r\n\r\n  I climbed the topmost summit,\r\n    And my gaze swept far and wide\r\n  For the garden roof where my brother stood,\r\n    And I fancied that he sighed.\r\n\r\n  My brother serves as a soldier\r\n    With his comrades night and day,\r\n  But my brother is filial and may return,\r\n    Though the dead lie far away.\r\n\r\nThe following far older poem was written in 800 B. C. by Li Hua to\r\ncommemorate a battle between the ancient Chinese tribe of Wei and the\r\nNorthern Mongols:\r\n\r\n                            THE BATTLEFIELD\r\n\r\n  Many men with but one heart;\r\n  Many lives to sell as one.\r\n\r\n  Foes and Nature interlock;\r\n  Sands arise; hills join the shock.\r\n\r\n  Rivers, death fills like a flood;\r\n  Red, Wei’s Great Wall too with blood.\r\n\r\n  Slaves ye shall be if ye yield;\r\n  Dead men if ye fight the field!\r\n\r\n  Fled no warrior; name on name,\r\n  Ghosts approach me, starred with fame.\r\n\r\nWith such Spartan poetry the early Chinese were able to fire the race\r\nwith militarism. The ideograph is virile and laconic in the highest\r\ndegree, just as the Anglo-Saxon of “Beowulf” is more condensed than our\r\nlater Latinized speech.\r\n\r\nConfucius believed in revenge upon a murderous enemy of one’s family.\r\nHe replied to a question of a pupil on this matter: “Have only your\r\nweapons for a pillow.”\r\n\r\nTwo of the promising colonels in the southern republican army are\r\ngraduates (1909 class) of the American West Point Academy. They were\r\nadmitted on the personal recommendations of President Roosevelt. One\r\nis Colonel Wen Ying Hsing, a nephew of Wen Tsung Yao, who is assistant\r\nminister of foreign affairs of the Nanking Republican Assembly. Colonel\r\nWen has seen hard service as military adviser of the Canton Provincial\r\nAssembly. The other “West Pointer” is Colonel Chen Ting, brother of\r\nDoctor Chen Shin Tao, minister of finance of the Nanking Republican\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\nOn one of my rambles through the narrow streets of Canton I dropped\r\ninto an artist’s shop on Yuck Tsze Street and selected some treasured,\r\ndelightful opal-colored paintings, full of spirit, of the old\r\npicturesque three-masted Manchu war-junks which in the early days one\r\nsaw sometimes beating into the reaches and broads of the flooded waters\r\nof Kwangtung province. The yellow shields, emblazoned with ideographs,\r\nhang over the midship bulwarks of the ship. The latticed red rudder is\r\nhigh above the water so that it may drag the unwieldy keelless boat\r\naround. The great blue sweeps, with yellow eyes, stretch from the\r\ngalley-ports. The ship itself has eyes on the bow. The overhanging\r\ncabin in the high stern is crowded with men, stores and bronze cannon.\r\nThe low red prow cuts the olive green sea into white foam. The red\r\ntriangular flags flaunt challenge from all the masts. The great square\r\nbrown matting sails spread like clouds above the blue-gowned leadsman\r\nin the bow. Dipping under the horizon are the fleeing black banners of\r\nthe enemy, and the sea-gulls scatter in terror. Only the serrated blue\r\nhills are brave along the iron shores.\r\n\r\nThe first important names in connection with the building and drilling\r\nof China’s modern navy are Captain Lang, R. N. (British), and Captain\r\nSiebelin (U. S. N. and H. S. M.). These men prepared the fleet for the\r\nwar with Japan in 1894, which developed Admiral Ting and Captain Teng\r\nas China’s sole naval heroes, who, however, could do little with an\r\ninefficient war board (Ping Pu) behind them. The captured battleships\r\n_Chen Yuen_ and _Ting Yuen_ are in Japan’s retired list. They were very\r\nfine ships for their day, and resisted heavy punishment in the battles\r\nof the Yalu and Wei Hai Wei. The navy training schools are at Tientsin,\r\nChifu, Nanking, Fuchau, Shanghai, Amoy, and there will be another at\r\nNimrod Bay, south of Ningpo. Admiral Beresford, on his visit to China\r\nin 1898, advised with the Chinese officials, especially Li Hung Chang,\r\nregarding navy matters, and some cruisers were built in England, though\r\nthe two best battleships were built in Germany. Captain Bradley Osbon,\r\nan American, served for years in developing the Chinese navy.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese cruiser _Hai Chi_, painted the regulation gray, and\r\nspreading the gorgeous yellow dragon flag, took part in King George\r\nthe Fifth’s coronation festivities at Spithead in July, 1911, and in\r\nSeptember, 1911, she came to New York and anchored beneath Grant’s\r\ntomb. Conspicuous friendliness on both occasions was shown to the\r\nofficers and crew as a mark of the new interest in China which has\r\narisen in Britain and America especially. Similar cruisers, the _Hai\r\nChow_ and the _Hai Yung_; gunboats of the _Po Pik_ class; and torpedo\r\nboats of the _Wu Pang_ class, were in constant use in China in the\r\nante-republican days. One day they were watching that Portugal did not\r\nencroach at Macao; a week later shelling rebels around the great cities\r\nwhich line the Yangtze River or making a dash to the Gulf of Pechili to\r\nbe ready to take on board the infant emperor. The cruiser _Fei Hung_,\r\nthe first Chinese warship built in America, was launched at Camden, New\r\nJersey, on April 24, 1912. Larger cruisers are building in England, and\r\nwhen Chinese politics and finances are more settled, it is proposed to\r\norder battleships from both Britain and America, and form three fleets,\r\nthe Northern, Yangtze Central and Southern fleets. Shanghai can dock\r\nthe smaller vessels, but British Hongkong alone has up to this time\r\nbeen able to dock battleships in Chinese waters. China has as yet no\r\nsubmarines. The British navy maintains several submarine torpedo boats\r\nat Hongkong, and in that land-locked harbor, of all others in the\r\nworld, the moral effect upon an enemy would be terrifying.\r\n\r\nIn recent years the naval policy of China has been developed by Prince\r\nTsai Hsu. Admiral Sah Chen Ping, who commanded the Yangtze fleet which\r\noperated against the republicans in October, 1911, and against the\r\npirates who attacked Yale College, at Changsha, in 1910, has visited\r\nAmerica, and entertained the American round-the-world fleet at Amoy\r\nin 1908. He has a son in a western American college. General Li Yuen\r\nHeng, one of the two greatest republican generals, was really trained\r\nfor the navy at Pei Yang and Chifu Colleges, and in Japan. Admirals\r\nJiu Cheng, Li Chun, of the Canton riots of April, 1911; Tan; Ching,\r\nwho entertained the American fleet at Amoy; Commander Hsu Chen Pang,\r\nwho was educated at Hartford, America; Admirals Liu and Hai Chun;\r\nAdmiral Chin Yao Huan and Commander Wu Chung Lin, both of whom visited\r\nNew York on the cruiser _Hai Chi_, are all well known. Commanders\r\nChen, Yang and Wong represented China when the cruiser _Fei Hung_ was\r\nbuilt at Camden, New Jersey, in 1912. When the republican troops took\r\nthe Shanghai arsenal it discouraged the navy, which could not secure\r\nammunition in time for effective work. The fleet then went over to the\r\nred, white and blue sun flag, and later landed a republican army in\r\nShangtung province at Chifu to flank the imperial left wing operating\r\nat Tsinan. The fleet also made a demonstration against Chin Wang Tao\r\non the gulf of Pechili, thus forcing the imperialists to hold several\r\ndivisions in the north to protect Peking. This enabled the republicans\r\nto follow up the Nanking victory, drive General Chang out of Nganhwei\r\nprovince, and made the Whei River instead of the Yangtze River the\r\nrepublican front. If America undertakes with a Pacific fleet to back\r\nup for all time the “non-partition of China” policy, the writer is\r\nnot a believer in a Chinese navy at present, outside of possibly one\r\ndreadnought a year when the finances are revised. Of course a strong\r\nrevenue and police fleet for the rivers should be provided. Attention\r\nshould rather be given to China’s army, so that she may be able to do\r\nher own police work as far as Russian or other intruders are concerned.\r\nHaving no oversea colonies, she really has no use for a navy at\r\npresent, excepting that one dreadnought a year would, if necessary,\r\nlend a little more than moral support to America’s altruistic and\r\nnon-land-grabbing policy in the Far East.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese are splendid sailors, and as is well known, they invented\r\nthe water-tight compartment in their junks, sanpans and wupans\r\nforgotten centuries ago. I have had much intercourse with the watermen\r\nof the southern provinces and can speak well of their seamanship. They\r\ncompose the crews of the mercantile fleets which cross the Pacific,\r\nand have brought their ships through those awful circular typhoons\r\nwhich rage for days. They have also developed modern yacht designers\r\nlike Ah King at Hongkong, and they are quick at the tiller and boom. I\r\nhave, in writing of the Chinese, given perhaps a hundred instances of\r\nthings which they do oppositely to the Occidental manner. Here is the\r\none hundred and first: Holding their nostrils, they dive feet foremost,\r\nlike the pearl fishermen of the Manaar Gulf of Ceylon! When our launch\r\nscrews would get tangled with the many ropes of Blake Wharf, Hongkong,\r\nI have often seen half of the crew merrily jump overboard with knives\r\nin their teeth, and work under water for an extraordinary length of\r\ntime; and though some writers call the Chinese stolid and humorless, I\r\nhave always seen them highly appreciative of applause and good-natured\r\nlaughter over the unexpected incidents that arise in an Oriental day’s\r\nwork. On one occasion the writer, who was exhausted with the tide, was\r\nsaved from drowning at Junk Bay, Hongkong, by the quick-witted efforts\r\nof a native laota (coxswain) who deftly swung his launch within reach,\r\nand whose ready arms reached out to “chiu ming” (save life).\r\n\r\nThe short story of China’s navy would not be complete without a word\r\non the naval engagements of the China-Japan War of 1894–5 over Korea,\r\nwhen the whole world breathlessly watched the first trial of modern\r\nironclads, and when the Chinese on several occasions really showed\r\nfearlessness under hopeless conditions. At the end of July, 1894,\r\nChinese troops arrived at the Yalu River (which divides Korea and\r\nManchuria) to reinforce General Yeh and Yuan Shih Kai, under cover of\r\nthe cruiser _Chi Yuen_ (2,300 tons, 17.5 knots), the _Kuang Yi_ (1,030\r\ntons, 16 knots), etc. On July 25th this fleet was met by the much\r\nsuperior Japanese fleet consisting of the _Yoshino_ (4,100 tons, 23\r\nknots), _Akitsushima_ (3,150 tons, 19 knots), and _Naniwa_ (19 knots).\r\nAfter a hot exchange the _Chi Yuen_ escaped from the faster _Yoshino_\r\nby superior work in the stokehold. The _Kuang Yi_ ran aground. Admiral\r\nTing, the one big name in China’s navy, with a weak squadron, daringly\r\nsailed from Pechili Gulf on September 14th for the Yalu, landed stores,\r\nand skilfully evaded Admiral Ito’s and Rear-Admiral Tsuboi’s squadrons.\r\nOn September 17th, Admiral Ting led the way with the _Chen Yuen_ (7,400\r\ntons, 15-knot German-built battleship) and the _Ting Yuen_, a twin\r\nbattleship, in the center, the other vessels on the wings, to meet the\r\nJapanese fleets which were advancing in column. Ito passed wide of\r\nthe right wing of the Chinese. At 6,000 yards the Chinese opened fire\r\nineffectively, but the Japanese reserved their fire until 3,000 yards’\r\nrange was reached. The Japanese passed through to the rear, and drove\r\noff the smaller Chinese warships. The larger Chinese vessels swung to\r\nstarboard to keep their bows toward the circling Japanese. The Japanese\r\narmored cruiser _Fuso_ (3,700 tons, 13 knots), built in England,\r\nsteamed in close to the Chinese line. The _Hi Yei_, protected Japanese\r\ncruiser (2,250 tons, 14 knots), crossed between the Chinese battleships\r\n_Chen Yuen_ and _Ting Yuen_, and as could be expected, both were so\r\ndamaged that they had to seek the Japanese rear. The slow Japanese\r\n_Akagi_, gunboat (614 tons, 13 knots), was hit by the Chinese left\r\nwing. The second Japanese squadron now came up, and at once attacked\r\nthe Chinese front, the first Japanese squadron having completed the\r\ncircle, attacking the Chinese rear. The Japanese then withdrew and\r\nreformed, but the Chinese were not able to reform their line. The\r\nChinese _Yuen Wei_ (gunboat, 1,350 tons, 16 knots) on fire, headed for\r\nthe Yalu, where she sank with the brave Captain Teng. The Chinese\r\n_Chao Yuen_ (gunboat, 1,350 tons, 16 knots) was accidentally rammed\r\nby the unmanageable Chinese _Chi Yuen_ (coast defense, 2,300 tons, 17\r\nknots), and both sank, leaving only the two Chinese battleships, which\r\nkept fighting and following the Japanese as best they were able. The\r\nsecond Japanese squadron sank the Chinese _King Yuen_ (coast defense,\r\n2,900 tons, 15 knots), while the first Japanese squadron circled\r\naround the two Chinese battleships, which could not be maneuvered to\r\nadvantage. The Chinese _Ting Yuen_ cleverly planted a shell into the\r\nJapanese _Matsushima_ (coast defense, 4,277 tons, 16 knots, French\r\nbuilt). At 5:30 P. M., after seven and one-half hours’ fighting, the\r\nJapanese withdrew for repairs, although they had three armored coast\r\ndefense, 4,200-ton, 16-knot ships in good condition, two armored and\r\nsix protected cruisers, all of which answered their helms.\r\n\r\nOn October 18th, the Chinese battleship _Chen Yuen_ struck at Wei Hai\r\nWei and was seriously injured. On February 5, 1895, at 2 A. M., by a\r\nbold move, the first of its kind in naval war, the Japanese torpedo\r\nboats raced for an entrance to narrow Wei Hai Wei harbor. Eight boats\r\ngot in under the high-pointed guns of the fort and fired eleven\r\ntorpedoes. One torpedo from boat “9” struck the Chinese battleship\r\n_Ting Yuen_, which steamed for shallow water, where the Chinese blew\r\nher up (this is the battleship which the Japanese later raised and used\r\nagainst the Russians in 1904). The Japanese lost torpedo boats “9” and\r\n“22”.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of February 6th, five more Japanese torpedo boats headed\r\nfor the harbor, and four entered, torpedoing the Chinese _Lai Yuen_\r\n(coast defense, 2,900 tons, 15 knots) German built; the _Wei Yuen_\r\n(corvette, 1,300) and tender _Pan Fah_. The Chinese torpedo fleet\r\nattempted to escape from the western entrance, but were captured or\r\ndestroyed by the first Japanese squadron. The Japanese towed mortar\r\nplatforms near the western entrance, and pounded the remaining Chinese\r\nbattleship _Chen Yuen_, which sank, as her deck was not armored (later\r\nraised by Japanese and used against the Russians in 1904). On February\r\n17th, Admiral Ito steamed in, and China’s one fighting naval hero,\r\nAdmiral Ting, brave but unfortunate, committed suicide. The Japanese\r\nsecured as prizes the _Kang Chi_, third-class cruiser (1,030 tons,\r\n16 knots), built at Shanghai; the _Ping Yuen_ (coast defense, 2,600\r\ntons, 10 knots), built at Shanghai, and the _Kuang Ping_ (third-class\r\ncruiser, 1,030 tons, 16 knots), built at Shanghai. The battle showed\r\nthe world that a large, fast mosquito fleet, with longer-range guns,\r\ncan whip even a few bulldog battleships, if the maneuvering of the\r\nlatter is crippled by lucky shots early in the engagement. In other\r\nwords, a fleet of faster unarmored cruisers, converted _Lusitanias_,\r\nfor instance, whose full gun and engine power is effectively\r\nmaintained, by choosing and keeping their favored range, could in the\r\nopen sea finally whip poorly handled units of slower battleships.\r\n\r\nOn one other occasion the crew of a Chinese warship quitted themselves\r\nlike men. That was when the gunboat _Chen Wei_ alone engaged the whole\r\nFrench fleet of armor-clads at Foochow, August 23, 1884. I quote the\r\nreport of an independent eye-witness, Commissioner Carrall of Sir\r\nRobert Hart’s Imperial Customs Service: “Exposed to the broadsides of\r\nthe _Villars_ and the _D’Estaing_, and riddled by a terrific discharge\r\nfrom the heavy guns of the _Triomphante_, the little _Chen Wei_ fought\r\nto the last. In flames fore and aft, drifting helplessly down the\r\nstream and sinking, she plied her guns again and again, till one of\r\nthe French torpedo boats, the Volta, dashing in through the smoke,\r\ncompleted the work of destruction with a well-placed torpedo.”\r\n\r\nThe successful rush of an unsupported republican torpedo boat at Hankau\r\non November 19, 1911, past the whole line of blazing imperial shore\r\nbatteries, in broad daylight, is considered by the foreigners of Hankau\r\nas dangerous and courageous a piece of work as the recent revolution\r\nexhibited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nMODERN EDUCATION IN CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are twelve modern universities available for the education of\r\nthe four hundred millions of people in China, located respectively at\r\nHongkong, Shanghai, Nanking, Changsha, Wei Hsien (Shangtung province),\r\nTientsin, Suchow, Tai Yuan, Peking, Hangchow, Wuchang and Canton.\r\nOne of these is British, nine Mission, one Chinese, and one American\r\nCollegiate.\r\n\r\nHongkong University counts among its former law students Wu Ting Fang,\r\nforeign minister of the Nanking republicans; among its medical students\r\nDoctor Sun Yat Sen, president of the Nanking republican government; and\r\nKang Yu Wei, the original reformer of China, who inspired the imperial\r\nreform edicts of 1898. The university is a growth of Queen’s College,\r\nAnglican (London Mission), and other foundations. Part of the land was\r\ngiven by a generous Parsee, Mr. Mody, and part of the endowment by Sir\r\nPaul Chater, both residents of the colony. One gift of $1,000 came from\r\nChang Ming Chi, at the time viceroy of Canton (Kwangtung province).\r\nThe Hongkong and Cantonese Chinese are generous contributors. The\r\ncolonial government and other private founders intend to put the\r\nuniversity on a broad basis worthy of the great colony, and equipped\r\nfor the vast opportunity offered to influence China in the ways of\r\npermanent progress. The Cantonese are, and have always been, leaders\r\nof republicanism and modernity, and most of their advanced students\r\nwill avail of the superior advantages offered by the new Hongkong\r\nUniversity. There are nearly half a million Chinese in the crown colony\r\nitself. Chinese pupils of the London Mission Girls’ School on Bonham\r\nRoad, Hongkong, have recently won high honors in the art examinations\r\nof the Royal Drawing Society, London.\r\n\r\nThe splendidly housed and equipped St John’s University at Shanghai is\r\nAmerican Episcopal. The tourist should take a rickshaw out to Jessfield\r\nsuburb, five miles from the River Bund, and see its modern buildings,\r\nwith adapted Chinese roofs. Its leading spirit has for years been a\r\nNew Yorker by birth, Doctor Francis Pott, son of the noted publisher.\r\nIts theological school is, of course, Episcopalian. Most important is\r\nits famous medical school, headed by Doctors Boone, Lincoln, Jefferys,\r\nTucker, Myers, and Fullerton, whom all Central China loves. Chinese\r\ndoctors, such as Tyau, Waung and Koo, assist. The school of arts is\r\nequally famous and brilliant, though perhaps not so imperative. I\r\nhope the day will soon come when this model university will have a\r\nlarger science school, not of mediocre equipment, but endowed by some\r\nAmerican at least half as richly as a standard American college would\r\nbe endowed in science. The library, museum, dormitories and teachers’\r\nschool all need endowments. The university has a full-fledged modern\r\nathletic department, and it is thrilling to see the Chinese boys\r\n“play up, play up, and play the game” of American football, baseball,\r\netc. The football team has mowed down the Municipal Police team on\r\nmany occasions. Track teams and rowing teams from St. John’s are yet\r\ngoing to make China famous at Olympics and Henleys. Military drill is\r\nexceedingly popular, and many of the four hundred boys, who represent\r\nevery province, jumped into the front rank in winning China’s\r\nrepublican revolution, though St. John’s has not yet taught politics.\r\nIt should and will perhaps add a strong branch in political economy.\r\nThe debating society is popular, as one could expect in the New China,\r\nand the dramatic society is successful, for the Chinese are born\r\nactors. The students also have a modern orchestra. The university is\r\nnot a “griffin”, for it dates back to 1879. Five large buildings stand\r\non the twenty acres of campus.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese pay in fees $20,000 a year, which is the record for “self\r\nhelp” in China. The college does a work free that it should not be\r\ncompelled to do, and that is to instruct the families of missionaries.\r\nSoon schools for this purpose will be opened at Shanghai, Kowkiang\r\n(Kuling mount), and elsewhere in the Far East. Even the poor of foreign\r\nfamilies are instructed free at St. John’s whose bowels of compassion\r\nso move for the whole East that verily she would exhaust herself in her\r\naltruistic zeal. One hundred dollars a year keeps a medical, science,\r\nart, political, pedagogical or theological student at St. John’s.\r\nSt. John’s asks what added American tourists and others will take a\r\n“share”, as they call it a Jessfield. The answer is that thousands\r\nwill. Six hundred dollars keeps one of the best students in America a\r\nyear to finish. St. John’s asks who will thus enable America to teach\r\nthe leaders of China, and forever sit closest to their hearts, as they\r\nrule the widest political and economical opportunity on earth. America\r\nand England should remember that if good does not sit on the bench in\r\nthe New China, evil will. Japan coerced China out of that immense 1895\r\nindemnity. She should morally pay part of it back, and part should go\r\nto the famous St. John’s University of Shanghai, where America has\r\nstood so long as a lighthouse amidst the dark waters of remote places.\r\n\r\nThe University of Nanking (New York State charter) is a union work\r\nof the American Methodists, the American Presbyterians, and the\r\nDisciples of Christ. Its strategic situation at the cultured capital\r\nof the imperial Mings, the high-water mark of the Taiping rebellion,\r\nand the capital of southern republicanism, is at once apparent. The\r\nleaders of the University took a dramatic part in bringing about the\r\nbloodless surrender of Nanking to the victorious republicans, who\r\nmight have avenged the imperialist Chang’s atrocities. Doctor A. J.\r\nBowen is president, and the following noted educational and medical\r\nleaders assist: J. E. Williams, J. W. Drummond, E. C. Lobenstine,\r\nDoctor Garritt, Alexander Paul, Frank Garrett, C. S. Settlemyer, Doctor\r\nE. Osgood, the noted Doctor J. C. Ferguson, Doctor Henke, Mr. Martin,\r\nMr. Millward, Mr. Bailie, Doctor R. Beebe, and W. F. Wilson. This\r\nuniversity does its immense work with only $44,000 a year, because\r\nevery one works for a pittance, the salary of the president being\r\nonly $1,500 in a land where life for the foreigner is expensive. That\r\nis to say, the president of the University of Nanking altruistically\r\naccepts in salary less than would the shorthand writer in the railway\r\noffice at Nanking, both of whom come from America; the one a cultured\r\ngentleman of power, the other probably only a machine mind. The five\r\nhundred Chinese students themselves contribute the remarkably large\r\nsum of $13,000 a year in fees. The departments include science, arts,\r\ntheology, pedagogy, athletics, and practically the all-important\r\nmedical department, because the East China Medical Association (dean,\r\nDoctor Shields) works in connection with the University. Nanking will\r\nalways be a political, naval, military, scientific and cultured center,\r\nand therefore the university will have a great influence in teaching\r\nthe coming leaders of the New China.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing narrow-minded about the college, for it teaches\r\nthe Chinese language, literature and philosophy. The extensive\r\ngrounds cover in the aggregate forty-three acres. There are several\r\ndormitories, chapels, residences for staff, and a Y. M. C. A. The\r\nbest building is the large science hall. The university, surely run\r\neconomically, needs larger funds for an endowment from America, because\r\nit has not the heart to turn away many promising but poor students who\r\nmust be accommodated practically free. Thirty dollars boards a worthy\r\nstudent for a year, and the college is always glad to hear from those\r\nwho will support scholarships, increase the buildings and equipment,\r\nor add to the library and endowment. Athletes of the university are\r\nmaking their mark, and may extend their triumphs to the Olympic games.\r\nFootball and track athletics are popular. There is a library, museum,\r\nstudents’ magazine, press, and of course a debating society. The\r\ncollege band, the largest in China, numbers seventy pieces. The boys\r\nshowed their mettle in benevolent activities when they contributed\r\nfive hundred dollars for the famine and flood victims, and besides\r\nvolunteered for work in the stricken districts of Nganhwei province.\r\nModel farm colonies in the distressed sections have been undertaken\r\nby the university. The university now makes a special appeal for a\r\nlarger library and reading room building, or institute, to throw open\r\nto the great metropolis, and in Chinese fashion, they propose to have\r\na self-supporting tea-room which will be a college club and city\r\ninstitute; a people’s institute in other words. This would be a very\r\npopular move in a city which politically will remain either as the\r\nfirst or second city in China. The Chinese themselves prefer it for the\r\ncapital; the foreigners in North China are using their influence to\r\nhave Peking retained as the national capital. While hot Nanking is not\r\nso healthy as Peking, the writer believes that the foreigners should\r\nbow to the wish of the Chinese, and have Nanking named as capital. The\r\nhigher classes of Chinese are timid as yet of the religious hall, but\r\nthey are enthusiastic attendants at lecture halls, libraries and clubs.\r\nNanking University intelligently proposes to miss no opportunity.\r\n\r\nYale University (Missionary Society) has its collegiate school and\r\nsplendid medical school and hospital at Changsha, the capital of\r\nconservative inland Hunan province, the former center of “Darkest\r\nChina.” The staff, in addition to the Chinese members, are Dean\r\nBrownell, W. J. Hail, D. H. Leavens, K. S. Latourette, Doctor E. H.\r\nHume, Nurse Nina Gage, and the wives of the staff. All the men are\r\nfrom Yale University, New Haven. As might be expected, wherever a Yale\r\nman goes, there is to be found the manly athletic temperament, and\r\nYale at Changsha has its champion football team which is repeating the\r\nCamp round-the-end runs, the Heffelfinger plunges, etc.! Yale in China\r\nagrees with the Nanking plan of including Chinese in the curriculum.\r\nWhile Yale College mainly supports the work, help for the hospital\r\nhas come from such churches as the Broadway Tabernacle, of New York,\r\nand private donors. Chinese physicians, fully equipped from a western\r\nstandpoint, like Doctors Yen and Hou, assist. This is the intelligent\r\neducational, medical and mission plan throughout all China: “Help the\r\nChinese to help themselves.” Yale College took a leading part in curing\r\nopium habitués, and in this astonishing reform in China Yale has been\r\nprominent. That the Chinese are not parsimonious or unappreciative is\r\nproved by the following facts. Among many others, the governor of Hunan\r\nprovince sent his check for seven hundred dollars, covering his own\r\nand the subscriptions of the officials under him, though he felt free\r\nto criticize foreign intervention in financial and railway matters in\r\nhis province. The governor of Chekiang province subscribed one hundred\r\ndollars, Ex-grand Councilor Chu gave one hundred dollars, Colonel Niu\r\ngave two hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nThe University of Pennsylvania has a similarly popular medical\r\ndepartment at Canton, and Harvard University plans shortly to have a\r\nmedical branch at Shanghai. Their choice of effort is perfect in wisdom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright, American Episcopal Church, Foreign Board, N. Y.\r\n\r\nThe splendid military company of St. John’s University, Shanghai.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright, American Presbyterian Church, Foreign Board, N. Y.\r\n\r\nShangtung University, at Wei, leading Presbyterian University. Located\r\nin Confucius’ province, and influential in the new intellectual China.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright, American Episcopal Church, Foreign Board, N. Y.\r\n\r\nThe largest foreign University in China, St. John’s American Episcopal,\r\nat Shanghai. Very influential in the New China.]\r\n\r\nThe Shangtung Union University, now located at Wei, will probably be\r\nmoved to Tsinan, the capital of the province in which Confucius and\r\nMencius were born. It is a union of the American Presbyterian and the\r\nBritish Baptists, and later the Anglicans, the American Baptists,\r\nCongregationalists and Methodists will join. The total endowment of\r\nthis effective university is only $35,000. There are five hundred\r\nstudents. There are collegiate, science, pedagogical, medical, Chinese,\r\nathletic and women’s departments. There is an attractive, towered,\r\nlarge main building, science hall, dormitories, museum and a unique\r\nobservatory. The chief members of the faculty are the well-known\r\nMessrs. Bergen, Hayes, Bruce, Burt, Luce and Whitcher, and the college\r\nis able to draw upon the many foreign notables at Peking and Tientsin\r\nfor popular lectures. China urgently needed advanced education. The\r\nindividual missions, brilliant in parts, were in general endowed so\r\npoorly that they could not furnish it. Therefore they united all over\r\nChina, and better results are being obtained in specialization by this\r\nintelligent method, which has established an example for the western\r\nworld to follow. Subscriptions should as usual be sent to the mission\r\nfavored by one’s early training or allegiance, and when they reach\r\nChina they are applied in some needy department of the union work.\r\nIn union, there is no lapping over or duplication, and the result\r\nis efficiency. When any member of the union lags, a united appeal is\r\naddressed to the home board. The high aim of this extensive University\r\nof Shangtung is to have an income of $150,000 a year. In all these\r\nuniversities the preparatory and pedagogical departments are not\r\nneglected. The need is urged of a large assembly hall, library, science\r\nhall, dormitories, scientific equipment, Y. M. C. A., etc., at Tsinan\r\nfor this university, which stands where four great roads of influence\r\nmeet and its opportunity is therefore inspiring. China, Britain,\r\nGermany and Japan come together closely in Shangtung province, and\r\nthe university’s sphere is so wide a one that the present constricted\r\nincome is insufficient. The students contribute nearly $2,000 in\r\nfees, though many students must necessarily be taught free. Shangtung\r\nUniversity has always stood high for its special work in translating\r\nand printing important books into Mandarin Chinese. It is interesting\r\nthat the students have developed choral work perhaps more than most of\r\nthe colleges. China has neglected music in the recent centuries, but\r\nSt. John’s, Nanking and Shangtung Universities are teaching it to her\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe Pei Yang University, of Tientsin, is the leading engineering and\r\ntechnical institute of China. Its teachers are Americans, British\r\nand Germans. English is taught. It aims to be the Stevens Institute,\r\nor Boston Tech. of China. The Chinese board has been sometimes\r\nobstructive, depending on the intelligence of the directors. However,\r\nthe school does wonderful and will do better work when affairs become\r\nsettled in China. Its hope, as in every other institute, is in its\r\ngraduates even more than in its professors, and certainly more than its\r\nnative directors of the old type! It will soon have the fine German\r\ntechnical schools of Tsingtau to emulate. The Pei Yang University\r\nhas sent out many notable graduates who have at once advanced to\r\nleadership in China. One is now vice-president of China.\r\n\r\nThe Shansi University at Tai Yuan, the provincial capital, was\r\nestablished in 1901 by the English Baptists with “Boxer” indemnity\r\nfunds restored to China at the request of Doctor Timothy Richard, the\r\npromoter of the Red Cross in China, and president of the university\r\nfor ten years. It is English and Chinese in personnel, and has passed\r\nthrough bloody waters in the many disturbances which have surged around\r\nit.\r\n\r\nPeking University is also a union in educational work of the American\r\nCongregationalists, American Presbyterians and London Mission, and in\r\nmedical work, of the Methodists and Anglicans in addition. This is\r\ndecidedly the leading medical college in China, and includes a women’s\r\nmedical college, nurses’ training school, hospital and dispensaries.\r\nWorld famous names in connection with the university are Doctor\r\nW. A. P. Martin, Doctor J. W. Lowrie, Doctor Smith, Doctor Wherry,\r\nDoctor Fenn, Doctor Leonard, Doctor Hall, Doctor Mackey, Doctor Young,\r\nand Doctor Lewis. The medical school led in the heroic efforts to stamp\r\nout the virulent pneumonic plague in Manchuria in 1911.\r\n\r\nAt beautiful Hangchow, the “bore city,” the American Presbyterians are\r\nerecting a full college equipment on a lovely site outside the city\r\nwall, on a hill near the water. The students run the grounds, gardens,\r\nroads, etc., on a “self-help” plan. The famous mission press, which\r\nis doing wonderful work in translating and publishing, is retained,\r\nhowever, at cultured Soochow for the present. At Soochow the American\r\nMethodists have established a large university. It has a prominent\r\nclock tower, an unusual feature, which is highly appreciated by the\r\nmodernized Chinese.\r\n\r\nAt Wuchang, where the republican revolution broke out in October, 1911,\r\nthe American Episcopals have Boone University, and Oxford and Cambridge\r\nwill establish here the extensive university on which Lord Salisbury’s\r\nson, Lord Cecil, after his visit to China, wrote a charming book in\r\n1910. At Canton is the Canton Christian College.\r\n\r\nThese are the leading universities. The Chinese themselves intended\r\nto establish government universities, high and preparatory schools,\r\nat all the twenty-one provincial capitals, but to date only those at\r\nPeking, Paoting, Tsinan, Tai Yuen, Nanking, Shanghai, Chingtu, Yunnan,\r\nTientsin, Hangchow, Fuchau and Canton have been established, and they\r\nhave drawn mainly on the mission universities and foreign-trained\r\nstudents for professors. The new education was naturally organized\r\nby the government first in the metropolitan province of Pechili. It\r\nincluded a university at Tientsin, a provincial college at Paoting,\r\nseventeen industrial schools, three high, forty-nine elementary\r\nnormal, two medical, three foreign language, eight commercial, five\r\nagricultural, thirty middle, one hundred and seventy-four upper,\r\none hundred and one mixed, eight thousand six hundred primary, one\r\nhundred and thirty-one girls’ schools and one hundred and seventy-four\r\nnight schools in the industrial cities. Is this not an inspiringly\r\ncomprehensive program? Both the Board of Education and Yuan Shih Kai\r\ndeserve credit for largely taking the suggestions of the foreigners at\r\nPeking and Tientsin in establishing in Pechili province this system\r\nof modern education, which stands as a model for the other twenty\r\nprovinces and territories. Many modern buildings have been erected,\r\nbut where sufficient money was not available, the fine old temples and\r\nbarracks have been impressed, and the surprised sad gods overthrown.\r\nIn many cases the gentry and guilds have donated buildings. The\r\ngovernment finds its greatest difficulty in securing teachers, and\r\nthey are exhausting the supply that the mission universities are able\r\nto certificate. This new proof of the friendliness of missions had\r\nmuch to do with the disinclination of the republicans and imperialists\r\nto take the lives of foreigners during the recent revolution. In\r\npreparing pupils to go abroad for further training, the government\r\nhas maintained at Peking a special school. At Chingtu, the capital\r\nof Szechuen province, the provincial government established railway,\r\nmedical, normal, mining, engineering, agricultural, foreign language\r\nand military schools, and owing to its success Szechuen led in the\r\nagitation for provincialism versus nationalization in railway and\r\nother matters, and this really opened the revolution in September,\r\n1911, a month before the outbreak in Hupeh province. The students in\r\nthe universities at the provincial capitals are clothed and boarded at\r\ngovernment expense, the student signing for three years and promising\r\nto answer a draft for government service.\r\n\r\nJapan has lost her grip to a degree, and America particularly and\r\nBritain have taken her place in educating China. The Chinese complain\r\nof the “enormous” cost of a foreign teacher, but have him or her\r\nthey will! The American educational advance has been astonishingly\r\nbrilliant. What America is doing for Chinese education can be judged\r\nby the statement that the American Presbyterian Church alone has three\r\nhundred and fifty-nine institutions of learning in China, and I believe\r\nthe Methodist denomination has even more, for that church leads in\r\nworld missions, as is well known. America does not pay for all of\r\nthis, for no race surpasses the Chinese in generosity and “self-help.”\r\nThe Hackett Presbyterian Women’s Medical College of Canton, under the\r\ncharge of the celebrated Doctor Mary Fulton, aims “to supply each\r\ncity with two modern physicians.” What a brave contract! Charities\r\nand orphanages are the special field of the Roman church; there is no\r\nwork that can equal theirs in China in this regard. The Protestants\r\nand Chinese prefer to train the more advanced mind. The American\r\nPresbyterians have a beautiful high school at Fati, Canton; an academy\r\nat Ningpo, a high school at the south gate of Shanghai, and an academy\r\nat Peking. The list is too long to enumerate. The annual reports of\r\nthe various Foreign Mission Boards make illuminating reading and give\r\nthe names of the heroic educational pioneers. The brilliant work of\r\nthe presses, like those at Shanghai, Peking, Wei Hsien (Shangtung) and\r\nSoochow, the ten thousand little rills of income, the contributions of\r\nthe broad-minded Chinese officials and students, are all surprising.\r\nHow much they are doing with so little money! How much they could do\r\nfor American and British educational influence in China with only a\r\nlittle more money! It is “up to” the American and British business man,\r\nif he decides to be both kind and “wise in his generation.”\r\n\r\nThe women of America and Britain are doing their share, especially in\r\nhospitals and nurses’ and girls’ schools. The American Presbyterian\r\nwomen have at Canton and elsewhere model institutions, similar to many\r\nthroughout the crowded land, which land is going to heal itself, with\r\nforeign help, of all its diseases: bodily, mental, economical and\r\ninternational. I have known several people of late who have inherited\r\nlegacies, and happening to read a China book, they were curious to see\r\nwhat a little money, that came so easily, altruistically “invested”\r\nthere, would do. They have erected a few hospitals and schools, and\r\ntheir joy has not ceased when they saw the wonderful results in the\r\nable hands to which the philanthropy was committed. The impetus they\r\nthus gave to the progress of the world was greater than the same amount\r\nwould have caused anywhere else.\r\n\r\nFor the girls and women of China, St. Hilda’s School, at Wuchang, where\r\nthe revolution broke out on October 10, 1911, does a great work under\r\nthe auspices of the American Episcopal women of Philadelphia, a few of\r\nwhom bought land outside the east gate of that old capital, where the\r\nfamous Chang Chih Tung was for many years viceroy. The girls’ college\r\nsprang up under the watchful eye of Bishop Roots, who has made a noble\r\nname among the Chinese. The opportunity of this school is to be yet the\r\nBarnard College or the Girton College of China, and of the need of it,\r\nby women for women, all this volume could not say enough. No land is\r\nsure of its progressive condition until the women are freed, educated\r\nand progressive. The enjoyment of continued progress by the men is not\r\ncertain until the girls and women are swinging alongside of them on the\r\ngreat road of life at the same pace, and with equal opportunity. There\r\ncan not be real companionship between inferior and superior; women and\r\nmen must be equal. Therefore the eyes of all China and America and\r\nBritain are on such institutions as St. Hilda’s. It, too, is run on the\r\nshare principle, fifty dollars per girl per year, to put a modern woman\r\nas a lighthouse in China to advance the world cause of womanhood.\r\n\r\nThe Yangtze valley, in particular, is the sphere of America’s\r\ninfluence, and where the high tide of rebellion swept, America’s\r\neducational influence will now follow, since fate has launched her\r\nthere in the colleges mentioned, and others not mentioned for want of\r\nspace. Lord Cecil plans to have the vast English foundation of Oxford\r\nand Cambridge Colleges at Wuchang (see his enthusiastic book), and\r\nif America has its equal at the other end of the brimming Yangtze at\r\nShanghai, honors will be equal. Germany is not going to neglect the\r\nopportunity, as she has plans for Nanking and Hankau. Much luck to her.\r\n_Contentia in bona!_ America and England have won a vast advantage,\r\nhowever, over Germany and France, in that China, on recommendation of\r\nthe Board of Education, has adopted English as the official language\r\nfor the study of science, geography, travel and international politics\r\nin all Chinese universities, technical colleges and high schools. This\r\nvictory was brought about through the influence of the Chinese students\r\nwho had studied in Britain and America, and a comparison of the\r\ntechnical and educational books issued by the different countries, the\r\nreport being that the English language had three to one in its favor.\r\nWhen the nations wish to study about China or any foreign country, they\r\nhave to take up or translate books written in English, for the American\r\nand Briton are the most curious concerning the world’s countries and\r\nnaturally the authorities on comparative ethnology and international\r\neconomics.\r\n\r\nThe Y. M. C. A. has come to China, and at Tientsin maintains a school\r\nas an adjunct pf the religious, literary and athletic work. Industrial\r\nschools have been opened, and they will do a vast work in recovering\r\nChina’s lost arts and extending her commerce. There is a government\r\nindustrial school at Peking for the production of the famous and\r\nalmost lost cloisonné, rugs, furniture, etc. The patterns for rugs are\r\nmemorized. At Tientsin the pattern is hung over the worker’s head. The\r\nschoolboys of old China were most familiar with the first two lines of\r\nthe Trimetrical Classic: “Man in the beginning was essentially holy.”\r\nIn Mandarin this is pronounced: “Jin chi tsu, sing pun shen.” The\r\npronunciation of the province of Szechuen is a little heavier, viz:\r\n“Jen dze tsou, sin pen chan.” Now the boys of New China are concluding\r\nthat “Man in the beginning was essentially misinformed!”\r\n\r\nThat the Chinese can become linguists has seldom been more uniquely\r\nillustrated than in the following experience related by Prince Henri\r\nd’Orleans. He was about to travel through the territories of the\r\naboriginal Lolo tribes of Yunnan province. The difficulty was to find\r\nan interpreter. The general interpreter who only knew the Mandarin\r\npronunciation of the north, or the Cantonese pronunciation of the\r\nsouth, would not do. The prince found at the Mission d’Etrangeres at\r\nTali, in remote Yunnan, an interpreter who knew the Lolo dialects, and\r\nthough he could not converse with the prince in French or English, he\r\ncould converse fairly well in Latin, and they got along splendidly. It\r\nappears that the Catholic fathers had taught the convert from the Latin\r\nFathers, Jerome, Chrysostom, etc!\r\n\r\nEager as the Chinese are to learn from text-books, they more eagerly\r\ncry for exhibits which appeal to the eye, and the establishment of\r\nmuseums, heretofore neglected, except in the few universities already\r\nmentioned, should be undertaken. Take one week’s records at the\r\nHongkong Museum, for instance. Four hundred and sixteen non-Chinese and\r\n163 Chinese used the library, but 193 non-Chinese and 3,100 Chinese\r\nstudied in the museum. The resourceful Canadian government sent a\r\ntraveling exhibit through China. It is what the Chinese call for. We\r\nshall yet see floating and wheeled museums, _in parvo_, throughout the\r\nempire, as educational bodies and merchants appreciate this as the\r\nquickest way to approach the Chinese mind.\r\n\r\nWhen the revolution of 1911 had developed strength, the Chinese\r\ngovernment found itself unable to remit to the thousands of students\r\nwho were studying in foreign countries. The American and British\r\nuniversities, without exception, nobly offered to aid any needy Chinese\r\nstudent. The move was brilliant and humane, and will be bread scattered\r\nupon returning waters of appreciation some day.\r\n\r\nThe new representative assemblies have necessitated the introduction of\r\nshorthand in China. The Tsze Chen Yuan (National Assembly) in session\r\nat Peking as early as August, 1911, ordered night classes to be opened\r\nfor learning the art, so that the civil service clerks might attend.\r\nI know that missionaries, helpless in committing to paper accurately\r\nthe sounds of the scores of Lolo, Miaotsze, and other dialects in\r\nYunnan, Szechuen and Kweichou provinces (where aborigines abound) have\r\nhad recourse effectually to phonography. If the brilliant Dickens,\r\nJohn Hay, the American secretary of state, who founded the policy of\r\n“non-partition of China,” and many others, were phonographers, why\r\nmight a missionary not be one also!\r\n\r\nSome of the educational proverbs of the Chinese are the following:\r\n\r\n“A lion breeds lions, and a brave father has brave sons.”\r\n\r\n“Learn easy, forget easy; learn hard, forget hard.”\r\n\r\n“Life is a river; if you are not going forward on it, you are falling\r\nbehind.”\r\n\r\n“Youth jumps and slips; age picks its steps and crosses safely.”\r\n\r\n“Measure words by the height of the brain, not the height of the body.”\r\n\r\n“A loose rein for a good head; a tight rein for a loose heart.”\r\n\r\n“Faces are alike, but minds are myriad.”\r\n\r\n“It takes longer to determine than to do.”\r\n\r\n“Fate doesn’t plan the lot of a fool.”\r\n\r\n“The mind chisels the face.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t far at the turn of two roads, but they end far apart.”\r\n\r\n“With weeds, and with learning, get at the root.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing that is human is alien to a good man’s interest.”\r\n\r\n“He who has no ambition is like an ax without edge.”\r\n\r\n“Moments are more precious than jewels, for the first can not be\r\nrecovered if lost; the second may be found.”\r\n\r\n“A right beginning makes a proper ending.”\r\n\r\n“A tight mouth keeps back much mischief.”\r\n\r\n“Heaven never put a bar against resource.”\r\n\r\n“When you know yourself thoroughly, you know everyone else.”\r\n\r\n“Prejudice is the thief of persuasion.”\r\n\r\n“Two things strangle, the tongue and the cord.”\r\n\r\n“Be as cross to yourself as you are to others; be as sweet to others as\r\nyou are to yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Never too great to learn.”\r\n\r\n“The last step must be as steady as the first in climbing a hill.”\r\n\r\n“The downy chin goes over it; the bristly chin goes round it; or, the\r\nyoung head for the long jump, and the old head for the long thought.”\r\n\r\n“Good gives the tangible, evil but the shadows.”\r\n\r\n“If you insist on every one being like you, look nowhere but in your\r\nmirror.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nNOTES ON CHINESE LITERATURE AND LANGUAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the treasures of Buddhist monasteries are the stone tablets\r\ncalled “Pei Tze.” It used to be the custom of celebrated visitors to\r\nwrite an epigram, a witticism, a poem, or a sentence of philosophy,\r\nwhich the monks had a stone-cutter engrave as near the beautiful\r\nchirography as possible on these tablets, which constitute through the\r\nempire a great literary treasure which is not likely now to be renewed.\r\nNot a little of the sententiousness is humorous. A sign hanging up in a\r\ncelebrated Buddhist monastery in the Chingtu plain, Szechuen province,\r\nmakes this merry reference to fleas, which constitute the largest\r\npart of the present immense population of China: “There are animals\r\nwith more legs than ponies at Inns _other_ than this Inn.” Another\r\npopular humorous motto is: “One can carry kindness too far, such as the\r\nfisherman who had such pity for fish that he would only go fishing with\r\nstraight hooks.” The idiom for inaction is: “keeping one’s hands in\r\none’s sleeves.” For “eating crow” the Chinese say: “eating a dumb man’s\r\nbitterness.” More of their wisdom follows:\r\n\r\n“Meekness and gentleness are the boat and the sail for crossing the\r\nrough stream of this world.”\r\n\r\n“The truths that we least wish to hear are those which it is most to\r\nour advantage to know.”\r\n\r\n“The way to glory lies through a palace; to riches through a market; to\r\nvirtue through a desert.”\r\n\r\n“The Manchu court is like the sea, where everything depends on the\r\nwind.”\r\n\r\n“He who wishes to secure the good of others has already secured his\r\nown.”\r\n\r\n“The prison is shut night and day, yet is always full; the temples are\r\nalways open, yet you find no one in them.”\r\n\r\n“He who lets things be given to him is not good at taking.”\r\n\r\n“The dog in the kennel barks at his fleas, but the dog who is hunting\r\ndoes not feel them.”\r\n\r\n“The finest roads are the shortest ones.”\r\n\r\n“Man may bend to virtue, but virtue can not bend to man.”\r\n\r\n“The wise man does not speak of all he does, but he does nothing that\r\ncan not be spoken of.”\r\n\r\nThe Occidental manner of emphasizing a plea is: “If you don’t follow\r\nthis advice, look out for the consequences.” Here is the Chinese\r\nphrase, as concluding Wu Ting Fang’s plea, in December, 1911, to the\r\nPrince Regent Chun to abdicate: “Our voice is hoarse and our tears\r\nare exhausted; no more can be said.” Their idiom for: “I’m not my own\r\nboss” is: “I eat another’s bread; I watch at the door.” More of their\r\nproverbs are:\r\n\r\n“Who is he, though he never goes out, yet has seen all that is under\r\nthe sky? The scholar among his books.”\r\n\r\n“If the ruby is unpolished, it is not a gem.”\r\n\r\n“Age for a sharp chin, and a sharp tongue.”\r\n\r\n“It is with human nature as with wines: age sweetens some and sours\r\nothers.”\r\n\r\n“Happiness and misery both come in doubles.”\r\n\r\n“Going through college doesn’t mean that the college has gone through\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“You can lead a boy to the right book, the rest depends on himself.”\r\n\r\n“The deeper the water, the slower the stream.”\r\n\r\n“It is easier to escape a splinter that you see, than a beam that you\r\ndon’t see.”\r\n\r\n“Familiarity takes the height off a mountain.”\r\n\r\n“Wit may purchase wealth, but wealth can not purchase wit.”\r\n\r\n“Originality can go so far back that it becomes aboriginality.”\r\n\r\n“Your parents died when you were a child,” is the bitterly sarcastic\r\nway in which the Chinese express that one has no manners, or\r\nup-bringing. The following repartee is credited to almost every\r\ntraveled Chinese official, but it originated in the imagination of an\r\nOccidental wit, because the Chinese consider manners and forgiveness\r\nthe first rule of public conduct. Official Bu was asked by an\r\nimpertinent Occidental why he wore such a ludicrous appendage as a\r\nqueue. “Why do you wear a mustache?” asked the Oriental, “Because I’ve\r\nsuch an awful mouth.” “I thought so, from your first question,” was the\r\nOriental’s rejoinder.\r\n\r\nYu Yuen, a satirist of 400 B. C., when China was divided into many\r\nstates, ruled by inferior princes, wrote in defense of the able prime\r\nministers who were trying to save the states: “I, too, am glad I can\r\nnot fall to the intellect and moral level of princes.”\r\n\r\nChang Jo Hu, A. D. 800, with Isaiah-like emphasis reminds even\r\nlong-lived proud China that\r\n\r\n “There’s no rock of empire man shall make,\r\n  But tooth and tide of time shall shake.”\r\n\r\nHe also wrote:\r\n\r\n “The waves of the Yangtze that pass to the sea,\r\n    Nevermore shall return to me;\r\n  So, friend of my soul, ’tis with me and with thee.”\r\n\r\nPo Chuh Ih, A. D. 772, once president of the Board of War, and later an\r\nexile, wrote some Scott-like lays, including the _Never Ending Wrong_,\r\nand the famous _Lute Girl_, which is full of silver music coming over\r\na moon-lit lake. At the lake he meets the lute-girl, once a court\r\nfavorite, but now old and deserted. The poet does not try to disguise\r\nthe truth. He says:\r\n\r\n “The eye of Beauty wins a monarch’s soul,\r\n  And wrecks an Empire, too.”\r\n\r\nTai Chen, a poet, speaking for the Emperor Ming Huang, who is pursued\r\nto Mount Omi, in Szechuen, by the rebel, An Lu Shen, writes: “The star\r\nof empire pales before the morning beams of conquering foes.” Some of\r\nhis lyrics show pretty conceits like: “The pansies are faces of loves\r\nthat have died.” His _Ruined Home_ reads like parts of Solomon’s wisdom.\r\n\r\nTai Chen was preceded by the most famous poet of China, Li Po (A. D.\r\n702). He was born in Szechuen province. His patron was the Emperor Ming\r\nHuang, then a wanderer, as we have stated. A Browning-like poet of the\r\nworld, he talks of the Tang emperors of Nanking, patrons of sculptors,\r\n“calling down the dreams of the gods and imprisoning them in stone.”\r\nIn an ode to Nanking, he tells about: “a woman asleep by a loom, and\r\na beautiful dream guiding her fingers along a glorious pattern that\r\nis known only to the gods.” He believes in the high mission of the\r\npoet, for he sings of “the fadeless lines of fire, running back to the\r\nbirths of immortal poets, who now walk amidst the stars.” Like others\r\nof the Chinese, and many of the new race of American poets, he has a\r\nstrong sympathy with trade unions. He addressed an ode _To the Golden\r\nPresence of Guild Brothers_. He sings mightily of war in a song _To my\r\nFatherland_, and then lapses thus into a sadder note when he reflects\r\nupon whom the sorrows of war come: “The pensive washwoman sends her\r\nheart to the Tartar war in far Kansu province to find her conscript\r\nsoldier husband who suffers in the snows.”\r\n\r\nKao Shih, a contemporary poet, was a tremendous believer in the\r\npersonal soul. He wrote striking verse because of his love of the\r\noccult, and his tendency to give to natural phenomena dramatic\r\npersonalities.\r\n\r\nOu Yang Hsiu, of the following dynasty, the Sung, 1007 A. D., himself\r\na governor, and historian of the Tang dynasty, wrote a famous “Autumn”\r\npoem, which is truly a march of Elizabethan metaphors. He showed, too,\r\na cynicism which was like the Elizabethan:\r\n\r\n “Fame, after all, is such a little thing!\r\n  Behold the fox and weasel’s young now play\r\n  Where lie the ashes of the great Man-Ching.”\r\n\r\nAbbé Huc’s servant, Wei Chau, picked up in the book stores of Nanchang,\r\nin Kiangsi province, pamphlets with the following brilliant epigrams,\r\nwhich are not surpassed in any literature, and which might have been\r\nwritten by Wilde:\r\n\r\n“My books speak to my mind; my friends to my heart; all the rest speak\r\nto my ears only.”\r\n\r\n“One needs his wits most when dealing with a fool.”\r\n\r\n“One forgives anything to him who forgives himself nothing.”\r\n\r\nWe call our printed Bible the “Word of God.” The Chinese have\r\nan expression somewhat similar. Their beautiful ideographs are\r\ndelightfully called “Eyes of God.” The following is an effort of the\r\nManchus in literature, translated idiomatically, and it shows the\r\nliterary feebleness of the relapsed old conquerors. It is the national\r\nanthem which the dynasty gave by edict to the Chinese to sing at the\r\nopening of the rebellion in October, 1911:\r\n\r\n “May the Golden Round be kept intact;\r\n  May Heaven help us;\r\n  Let the people and Nature live as quietly as ducks among lilies;\r\n  Both peoples (Chinese and Manchu) now dress alike; therefore be alike;\r\n  In this time of the Manchu (Ta Ching--Great Pure) dynasty we are\r\n          fortunate to see true splendor and greatness;\r\n  May Heaven protect the Emperor and his line;\r\n  For Heaven is greatest,\r\n  And Nature is infinite” (the suggestion being to fear God, or Nature’s\r\n          god).\r\n\r\nThe omnivorous Goethe made some investigation of Chinese literature,\r\nand here is his opinion of what he had read: “The people think, act\r\nand feel almost entirely as we do, although with them everything is\r\nclearer, calmer and more moral. In their arrangements everything is\r\nsensible, bourgeois, without great passion or poetry. What is moral,\r\nproper and in strict moderation is considered.” Now and then more or\r\nless distinct evidences of Chinese influence on the Greeks come to\r\nview, though the thread west of the headwaters of the Tarim is now\r\nlost. Many of the doctrines of Pythagoras and Plato are similar to\r\nthose of Chinese Lao Tse, and therefore they may have been instructed\r\nby the Chinese sage, whose book could have gone overland to Greece with\r\nthe caravans of silk.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the many newspapers has made a great difference in\r\nthe nerves and consciousness of the Chinese. From being the most\r\nstolid of peoples, indifferent to famine, flood, war, persecution by\r\nthe officials or by the favored, poverty, pain, hardships physical\r\nand mental, they have become as restive, impatient, nervous and\r\nself-conscious as other races. Famine and flood used to sweep down\r\nand destroy millions. What was the use of complaining, since no one\r\nknew, nobody cared, and the victim might as well not care? Now, if\r\ndisaster takes off not a million men, but one man, it is important,\r\nthe newspapers chronicle it, and show how the lot of others may be\r\nthe lot of the individual. The sufferer himself cries: “Woe is to me;\r\nisn’t this unendurable; help me; I can not, I WILL not bear it.” The\r\nnewspaper has developed the ego. The Chinese has become self-conscious\r\nand nervous. He can not, he will not hereafter bear anything more than\r\nother peoples. In the August, 1911, floods and the October, 1911,\r\nrevolution more fuss was made over the loss of a thousand men and women\r\nthan over the loss of hundreds of thousands in the Taiping rebellion in\r\nthe same region in 1853.\r\n\r\nNot long ago, a weekly at Hongkong appealed to its public for a new\r\nname. I quote some of the names to reveal what the Far East thinks of\r\nitself in a humorous or serious light: “Bird of Freedom”; “Bubbles”;\r\n“China Answers”; “Cathay’s Looking Glass”; “Chop Sticks”; “East\r\nof East”; “Fragrant Waters” (the translation of Hongkong); “Fire\r\nCrackers”; “Murmurs and Funnosities”; “Mixed Pickles”; “Peak and\r\nPraya”; “Topical Tropical Times”; “The Griffin” (a beginner in the\r\nOrient); “The Gong”; “The Hit”; “Humming Top”; “Imperial Outpost”;\r\n“The Lantern”; “Merry-Go-Round”; “The Palm”; “The Pearl”; “Sun of\r\nCathay”; “The Typhoon”; “The Ferret”; “The Colonel”; “Maskee” (the\r\nChinese way of saying “never mind”); “Puckee” (the Oriental way of\r\nsaying “O.K.”). The Chinese newspaper is a success, commercially,\r\npatriotically and educationally. Millions now read it every day. It\r\ngave the best and earliest news of the October, 1911, revolution.\r\nThere are Chinese newspapers in San Francisco, New York, Vancouver,\r\nSingapore, Penang, Hongkong, Sydney, Paris and London.\r\n\r\nChinese plays recite the history of the clans and early states. Even\r\nthe boatman and laborer are familiar with them. Every hill, valley,\r\nand reach and fall of a river north of the Yangtze has its hero and\r\nstory. This would seem to prove that the race first came through the\r\nTarim and Kansu gates to the new land. The rich, who aim to control\r\ntrade routes and privileges depending upon popular tolerance, in\r\nRoman fashion give free theatricals to the village folk. The acting\r\nis excellent and spirited; the feats of memory remarkable, and the\r\ncostumes gorgeous. “Once an actor always an actor,” they say, regarding\r\nthe custom of youths being bought or apprenticed by the traveling\r\ntroupes. Guild halls and some monasteries have theaters in connection\r\nwith the compound. A restaurant is run during the long series of plays.\r\nYou hurry out to dine when the play you are least interested in is rung\r\nin by cymbal. Bets and lawsuits between the guilds and villages are\r\noften settled by the loser paying for the visit of a theatrical troupe.\r\nBeautiful specimens of the blue and gold gowns of the emperor-actor can\r\nbe secured at the silk shops of the treaty ports, and in some of the\r\nOriental shops of New York, San Francisco and London.\r\n\r\nThe American and British college graduate wears a hood; the Chinese\r\nwears a yellow panel on his breast and back (it may be changed under\r\nthe republicans to blue). When Yuan Shih recently took the oath of\r\noffice as provisional president, two bonzes of the famous Lama Temple\r\nat Peking stepped up, and presented him with honorary panels of yellow\r\nsilk.\r\n\r\nThe incident will be recalled in Judges, Chapter 12, where the\r\nGileadites slew the Ephraimites who could only pronounce the word\r\n“shibboleth” as “sibboleth”. The Manchus are thicker of tongue than\r\nthe Chinese. An ingenious story got about in October, 1911, that the\r\nrebels of General Li’s army were testing some disguised Manchus with\r\nthe pronunciation of the numeral six, “Liu”, before killing them in\r\nretaliation for a massacre, the Manchus being unable to get the sound\r\nfar enough back in their mouths and around their tongue in the proper\r\nChinese fashion. The proper tone, lisp and aspirate makes all the\r\ndifference, for the same written word “ho” means river and fire; the\r\nword “shui” means water and sleep; “chih” means gas and red, and so on.\r\n\r\nEnglish, and not German, has been prescribed as the language to be\r\nused in the study of science and world politics. The Chinese idiom\r\nand ideograph could not come near enough to distinct expression. For\r\ninstance, the best they could do with fire-engine, steam-roller,\r\nElijah’s chariot of fire, and automobile, was to call them all “fire\r\ncarriage”; and electricity, globe, and flash-light were all three\r\n“lightning breath”. Geography, the world, and panorama were all called\r\n“All Under Heaven” (Tien Hsia). “Heavenly Literature” (Tien Wen)\r\nrepresented the words theology and astronomy. Lacking pronouns, the\r\nlanguage adopts peculiar expedients. Thus an affix meaning “near”\r\nanswers to “my”, and “that side” answers to “your”. That is, “near\r\nhouse” is my house; “that side house” is obviously your house. If this\r\ndoes not clearly convey the idea, the arbitrary ideographic affix of\r\n“honorable” and “despisable” will; that is, the “honorable house” is\r\nyour house of course, and the “despisable house” with so effusively\r\nmannerly a people could only be my house. On account of their\r\nexperience with the difficult and beautiful Chinese character which\r\nrequires accuracy, the Chinese penman who learns to write English,\r\ndoes it in the most beautiful Spencerian copper-plate. The same care\r\nand skill is shown in copying drawings from our modern text-books,\r\nwhich have been translated for their new schools. The Chinese think in\r\npictures. The characters for “many stars, clouds wait” means a clear\r\nnight, as “clouds many, stars wait” means a gathering storm. This is\r\nwhy they have chosen English for its exactness, as they can not well\r\nexpress the word gathering. “It is bad walking” is rendered by “Walk\r\nnot attain” (Tsou puh te). Passenger boats or skiffs are not so named.\r\nThose in use at Hongkong are called “san pans” (meaning three boards),\r\nand the famous light boats of the Yangtze gorges between Ichang and Wan\r\nHsien are called “wu pans” (five boards). The forcible etymology of\r\nsome Chinese words is illustrated by the words for “fan tan” gambling,\r\nwhich literally means “turn and part”. The cup is turned over a lot\r\nof coins, and the rest of the heap is brushed aside. Then the cup is\r\nraised, and the croupier, with his separator-stick, parts four coins\r\nat a time from the lot, until four or a particle are left, this being\r\nthe winning number of the game. That the old southern Chinese, as\r\ncontrasted with the succeeding northern Mongol invaders, invented the\r\nlanguage is shown in many of the words. For instance, the word for\r\nroad or path is called throughout China a “dry way”, and not a road or\r\nstreet. Only the central and southern provinces flood the fields for\r\nrice culture, leaving the raised dry paths.\r\n\r\nSamuel Pollard, a missionary working in Yunnan, is compiling an\r\nalphabet and reducing to writing the speech of the hitherto unrecorded\r\naboriginal tribes, the Miao and Lolos. He plans then to give them some\r\nwestern literature in return for the ethnological riches which they\r\ngive us. They are the most unique people in the world, older even than\r\nthe Chinese. Their fortresses are in Szechuen, Yunnan and Kweichow\r\nprovinces, and there are, perhaps, two millions of this fearless\r\nfighting race. From dimmest history they have been pressed back to the\r\nmountain tops by the Chinese, who have spread out from their original\r\nhome in the Yellow River valley with four hundred million people. That\r\nthe Chinese have impressed some of their language, as far as necessary\r\ntrade goes, on the aborigines can be seen from the following table,\r\nthere remaining only two (two and five) sounds in these eight, which\r\nhave not been somewhat influenced:\r\n\r\n    MIAO ABORIGINE    CHINESE\r\n  1     Ah              Ee\r\n  2     Ow              Erh\r\n  3     Tsz             San\r\n  4     Peu             Su\r\n  5     Peh             Wu\r\n  6     Glow            Liu\r\n  7     Ya              Pah\r\n  8     Chow            Chiu\r\n\r\nThe writer in the Antiquity chapter of a former book adopted the\r\nBiblical account of the creation, that the original Chinese (Chou\r\nclan’s ancestors) spread through Turkestan, along the Tarim valley, to\r\ntheir first known home in Shensi province. Doctor Stein has found on\r\nthe site of the ruined temple of Hangayi Tuti at Khoten, in Chinese\r\nTurkestan, birchbark and other manuscript in an unknown language. These\r\npoint the way to a further search. The Asiatic Society, of Bengal,\r\nCalcutta, has acquired from a Montenegrin gentleman, who traveled in\r\nTurkestan, five leaves of brownish yellow manuscripts eight by six\r\ninches, in an unknown language, which wait to reveal possible wonders\r\nof China’s prehistoric story. The pages show that they were one part\r\nof an extensive work now lost in the sands and camp ashes of central\r\nAsia. There is room for emulation by America, Britain and China of\r\nRussia’s archeological research in Chinese Turkestan, for the world\r\nwants to know more of ancient China, now that the New China has\r\nbecome important. The professors of the American colleges in China\r\nare sufficiently learned to make a beginning in preserving China’s\r\nantiquities, which are now in great danger of being lost forever. The\r\nrage, as far as the Chinese themselves are concerned, is altogether for\r\nthe new and utilitarian. The modernized Chinese have already forgotten\r\ntheir conservative Hanlin Academy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nLIFE OF FOREIGNERS IN CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nI know of no place where music, lanterns, romantic mountain scenery,\r\nseascapes far below and delightful society in an alien setting combine\r\nmore pleasantly than at the Peak Club, Hongkong. Above the passing\r\nclouds which now and then whirl around as in Rubens’ pictures, over the\r\npurple Pacific Ocean which foams around hilly islands, over the high\r\nhills as you ascend from the royal colony of Victoria, on a terrace,\r\nthey have graded a velvet lawn. Here the military and naval bands are\r\nbrought for a promenade concert in the soft night of the fragrant\r\nOrient, beneath Bowring’s “wide Cathayan tree”. The band of the Royal\r\nWelsh Fusiliers, from Mt. Austin barracks, plays the stirring Welsh\r\nnational march, _The Men of Harlech_. The men sing the chorus:\r\n\r\n “See! the bonfire light before ye,\r\n  How its fiery tongues do call ye,\r\n  Come as one to death or glory,\r\n      Heroes of the fight.\r\n\r\n “Lest by fire they kill and plunder,\r\n  Harlech! Harlech! make them wonder\r\n  At thy power that none can sunder;\r\n      Freedom thou wilt give.”\r\n\r\nFlowering plants in large colored Chinese kongs are set out everywhere.\r\nThe stars and moon shine. The pictured lanterns gently swing, and the\r\nhorn lanterns of Ningpo are opal soft. The light flashes from swords,\r\nuniforms and jewels. The blue-gowned Oriental servants noiselessly pass\r\nrefreshments. Not a Chinese house is in view, though half a million\r\nChinese live hidden in the foothills. On the hundred peaks of Hongkong\r\nIsland, the lights of a hundred palaces and villas of the merchant\r\nprinces shine out. Down the winding cement paths, chairs bearing\r\nlanterns and carrying guests are borne with their rhythmic swing.\r\n\r\nEvery lady and every man present has come from far, and knows much\r\nof life and geography. The conversation tires not, for there is\r\nsomething of great interest to tell. Kitchener’s brother (Kitchener\r\nhimself would not come--he never moves in “society”); General Wood,\r\nof the United States Army; Commander Greeley, United States Navy, of\r\nNorth Polar fame; Admiral Scott, of the British Navy, who invented\r\nthe large gun “dotter” that made the heavy marksmanship possible,\r\nand whose 4.7 gun saved Ladysmith; Nathan, the hero governor of the\r\ntyphoon and _Hankow_ holocaust; the governor of the Philippines at\r\nthe far stretched-out line of America’s new fame and empire; Kipling\r\nhimself full of his colored phrases; authors of books on China, many\r\nof whom live in Hongkong; German, French and Russian commanders, whose\r\nimpetuous ambition has made many moves that have nearly started world\r\nwars; ordnance and commissariat colonels, who, without a hitch, have\r\nprovisioned famous international military relief expeditions; prince\r\nand pauper explorers who are one in the camaraderie of adventure for\r\nscience; curio collectors who are raking the world to enrich western\r\nmuseums with enravishing art; Ponting, the photographer who went with\r\nthe intrepid Commander Scott to the South Pole; seven-year indentured\r\n“griffins” who are second sons of noble houses and whose inheritance\r\nof style is a millstone around the necks of their impoverished\r\nincomes; subalterns who are chafing at the bit to be let make a mark\r\nlike Kitchener; visiting lieutenants from Manila who would emulate\r\nFunston in the Philippines; Japanese doctors who have beat the world in\r\ndiscovering Bacillariaceæ; Parsees who have founded universities and\r\nhave, therefore, dined with “my friend, the king”; the merchant princes\r\nand the missionary apostles of China, whose knowledge would fill books;\r\nwomen of grace, beauty and learning, nibbling at sweet cinnamon,\r\nmusk and lotus; international spies of both sexes from the notorious\r\nBrussels headquarters; all move over the quiet grass, listening to the\r\nhaunting strains of the bewitching music, which makes the heathen hills\r\nunalien under the swinging lanterns and the white-riding moon.\r\n\r\nWhen you lift your glass to say “_prosit_”, “here’s how”, “_à bon\r\nsanté_”, or “here’s to you, old man”, with no national reservations,\r\nand a feeling that all traveled men are brothers; and some fraternally\r\nwider day possibly you will not shiver when John Celestial, Friend\r\nNippon, and Aryan Bengal are admitted to the delightful company\r\ngathered under the whispering bamboos and floating sandal scent of the\r\nPeak Club of Hongkong.\r\n\r\nIt is the same interesting story on ladies’ night at the Bund Club of\r\nCanton; the Jockey Club of Shanghai; the Hankau Club; the Tientsin\r\nClub; the delightful conversazioni at Sir Francis Aglen’s on Customs\r\nStreet, Peking, when the National Customs Band plays; the Gouverneur’s\r\n“Palais” at Saigon and Hué; the International Club at Harbin;\r\nGovernment House at Wei-Hai-Wei; or the consulate at Chifu. It whets\r\nthe imagination to be dancing within sight of the stacked rifles at\r\nthe front, and you reverse Tennyson and say in Locksley Hall: “Better\r\none night in Cathay than a cycle of Park Lane” (or Fifth Avenue)! You\r\nrecite the thrilling incidents, such as the ball which Wellington\r\nattended on the eve before Waterloo, etc.! Certainly the foreigner in\r\nrecent years has never known when he would be called upon at Hongkong,\r\nCanton, Hankau, Shanghai, Tientsin, Amoy, Macao, Fuchau, etc., to rush\r\nout, in either his dress or his business suit, or possibly his night\r\npajamas, with his gun, to defend property, some kind of government,\r\nand the white man’s rights and habits of trade and international\r\ncivilization. Not only white men have suffered and borne, but the\r\nforeign heroines of diplomacy, missions and trade of Wuchang, Hankau,\r\nCanton, Peking, Tientsin, Chingtu, Chungking, Amoy, Fuchau, etc., are\r\nnumbered in hundreds.\r\n\r\nThe foreigner in China enters upon his sporting and social enjoyment\r\nkeenly, because his sufferings from climate, alienation and danger\r\nare also keen. Taking his life altogether, he deserves more than he\r\nreceives as a reward for his work, and he and his wife are unusually\r\ninteresting people to meet, as I know from three years’ life in their\r\nhonored midst.\r\n\r\nThe human beasts of burden--the rickshaw coolies of Hongkong, Shanghai,\r\nand the treaty ports--are directed by little of their own language.\r\nOnly a few of the mercantile men on station learn the language.\r\nThe foreign tourist generally learns two words, “kwai se” (go) and\r\n“man-man” (stop-stop), and the coolies, like beasts, therefore depend\r\nfor directions as they race along in the heat, on a tap on the left\r\nor right shaft to indicate which street the “fare” desires to turn\r\nup. Hongkong proposes to have printed on a large bill-board at every\r\nchair and rickshaw stand a list of fares. Hongkong and Shanghai have\r\nbecome great tourist centers, whole shiploads landing there from New\r\nYork and San Francisco, and the tourist’s generosity or lack of local\r\ninformation permits him to pay so large a fare that the expenses of the\r\nresident are raised beyond endurance. The example of Hongkong might\r\nwell be copied at every tourist center over the world. “A fair price,\r\nbut not a foolish price” is the watchword in these new days of economy\r\nand efficiency, because world-waste can be tolerated no longer.\r\n\r\nThe regiments which from time to time come to garrison Hongkong\r\nreveal many interesting traits in their customs and uniform. The\r\nRoyal Welsh Fusiliers, fresh from the Boer War, wore three silk\r\nribbons down their backs. They are the only British regiment which is\r\npermitted thus to mourn the deprivation of the old “pig tail” of the\r\nbewigged regiments of the Georges, which custom they were the last\r\nregiment to discontinue. The Lincolnshires wear a band of green to\r\nshow that they are foresters recruited in Robin Hood’s country. The\r\nInneskilling Fusiliers and the Somersets at Tientsin retain their\r\ntraditional territorial peculiarities. The Cameronians are the only\r\nBritish regiment which is allowed to bear arms into church service,\r\nas a reminder of the old strenuous days of surprise when the clans\r\nmight leap like a wolf from behind even the pulpit. There are so many\r\nbranches of the historic British service in Hongkong’s, Tientsin’s,\r\netc., garrison life that American tourists are delightfully entertained\r\nand instructed in tradition that is far from uninteresting. The British\r\nhave found that to recruit and fight a man as a number is not a\r\nsuccess, as compared with the picturesque traditions in a territorial\r\narmy of uniform, customs, names, fetish, romance, glory, flags,\r\ndistinctive rights, etc. In other words, they humor Tommy Atkins as a\r\nboy, and he fights for them like a man, every time it is necessary.\r\nThis was shown when the swagger regiments of the Guards of London,\r\nunder Generals French, Paget and Roberts hit the Boer lines as hard\r\nas the Royal Welsh, who are recruited from sturdy fearless miners.\r\nBret Harte’s “Caucasian showed that he was no more played out” on\r\nthose occasions than he was when he rushed El Caney and San Juan Hill\r\nled by Roosevelt, Lawton, Chaffee and Wheeler. The Chinese of Peking\r\nand Tientsin in 1900 had a chance to see the brilliant performance\r\nof the American Fourteenth Infantry, Sixth Cavalry, and the marines\r\nunder Captain McCalla of the cruiser _Newark_, and recently the\r\nfine Fifteenth Infantry, U. S. A., has renewed the very favorable\r\ngentlemanly impression at Tientsin and along the railway line to Peking.\r\n\r\nWhen the military weddings take place at St. John’s Cathedral,\r\nHongkong, and the cathedrals at Shanghai and Tientsin, it is customary\r\nfor the brother officers of the groom to unsheath their swords and make\r\nan arch of steel over Mars and Venus as they make their exit from the\r\nchurch. This old custom is not often seen elsewhere than in India and\r\nChina, and would be a pretty one to adopt for military weddings the\r\nworld over. The Germans particularly would take to it with zest; in\r\nfact, they have just adopted it in their “kirche” at Tsingtau, North\r\nChina, and the Americans may adopt it in the smart military life of\r\nManila.\r\n\r\nImportant newspapers published in English are the _Times_, at Tientsin;\r\nthe _Mail_, _Telegraph_, _Press_ and _Post_, of Hongkong; the _Herald_,\r\n_News_, _Mercury_, _Press_, _Far Eastern Review_ and _Times_, of\r\nShanghai; the _Post_, of Hankau; the _Gazette_ and _Times_, of Amoy,\r\nand the _Echo_, of Fuchau. The _Times_ and the _Cable News_, of Manila;\r\nthe _Free Press_ and _Echo_, of Singapore; and the _Englishman_, of\r\nCalcutta, may be included, together with the _Chronicle_, of Japan,\r\nbecause they circulate in China ports, “nothing that is Oriental\r\nbeing alien” to their fascinating news columns. Their editorials are\r\nilluminating, and often exhibit in their cultured English positive\r\ngenius. They are an authoritative source of information on the\r\nabsorbing theme of golden Cathay, and the interest of the brave\r\nOccidental pioneer in her awakening.\r\n\r\nWater polo, swimming, launch, golf, cricket, tennis, yacht, dramatic,\r\npolo, etc., clubs are established at nearly all the treaty ports, and\r\ninter-Hong, inter-service, international and inter-regimental contests\r\nare constantly going on to take the edge off ennui in the long day\r\nof Oriental exile in a seven-year indenture. For those inclined to\r\nliterature, science and ethnology, there are notable library and\r\nAsiatic associations, and some of them superintend an indispensable\r\npress. Royalty visits Hongkong frequently and encourages every phase of\r\nlife in the premier colony. On the occasion of the Duke of Connaught’s\r\nlast visit with his family they received the military at the landing\r\npier and the populace at the City Hall; unveiled statues to the late\r\nKing Edward and King George; lunched with the governor and council;\r\nattended a meeting of the Scottish Rite Masons, lunched with the mess\r\nof the Indian frontier regiment camped out on the foothills of China;\r\nattended a Chinese theater; ate at a Chinese restaurant; attended a\r\ndaylight try-out of the racing ponies, Indian-breds and Walers at the\r\nWong-Nei-Chong Jockey Club; and went with “Hoi-Polloi” on a week-end\r\ntrip on the steamer _Fat Shan_ to see Canton’s sights, and “tiffin”,\r\nas does the whole world of globe-trotters, on the third veranda of the\r\nfive-storied pagoda. German royalty is just as active at Tsingtau,\r\nFrench nobility at Saigon and Haiphong, Portugese nobility at lovely\r\nMacao, and the cosmopolitan world at the “Paris of the East”,\r\nShanghai. Of Macao, the famous poet, Sir John Bowring, wrote:\r\n\r\n “Gem of the Orient earth and open sea,\r\n  Macao! that in thy lap and on thy breast\r\n  Hast gathered beauties all the loveliest,\r\n  Which the sun smiles on in his majesty.\r\n  The very clouds that top each mountain crest,\r\n  Seem to repose there, lingering lovingly.\r\n  How full of grace the green Cathayan tree\r\n  Bends to the breeze--and now thy sands are pressed\r\n  With gentle waves which ever and anon\r\n  Break their awakened furies on thy shore.\r\n  Were these the scenes that Camoens looked upon,\r\n  Whose lyre, though known to fame, knew misery more?”\r\n\r\nIn a former book, _The Chinese_, I have referred to the high cost of\r\nliving at Hongkong, Shanghai, etc., as far as rent is concerned. This\r\nis because a navy and army have to be maintained. It is well known\r\nthat Hongkong contributes to the British Budget more pro rata than\r\nany part of the long red line of British empire. The man who goes to\r\nthe hot damp East to advance the cause of imperialism, and who reads\r\nKipling and Gilbert Parker, pays high for it in money as well as\r\nhealth, and he deserves more than he receives. Land values are twice\r\nwhat they are in the suburban cities of New York, such as Brooklyn and\r\nJersey City, and twice what they are in the outlying wards of London.\r\nYaumati is a section of Hongkong’s colony on the China mainland, and\r\nvalues there are not so high as on hilly Hongkong Island. Yet a plot\r\nof land 150 by 140 feet, recently sold in Yaumati for $8,700 gold. No\r\nAmerican or European should be sent to the treaty ports of the Far East\r\nto support any cause, diplomatic, military, commercial, scientific,\r\nacademic, religious, or international customs, who is not given twice\r\nthe emolument that he would receive at home. Yet the mission leaders\r\nin particular generously accept far less than they would receive as\r\nworkers in America.\r\n\r\nThe foreigner has a larger list of supplies to pick from than was the\r\ncase before modern roads were opened and the Chinese were taught to\r\nfarm for the foreigner’s table. Ice houses, ice machinery, inspected\r\nmarkets, and water tanks for fish all have aided. Not so long ago we\r\nin the Far East were benzoate of soda and salicylic acid fiends, the\r\nmen Doctor Wiley bemoaned; that is to say, our gun was a can-opener,\r\nand our game was tinned foods. We could go out into the jungle of\r\nQueens Road or the praya, Hongkong; Nanking Road, Shanghai; Kaiser\r\nRoad, or the Chien Men Fair, Peking; or the bunds at Tientsin, Canton\r\nor Hankau, on our way home from office, and with our weapon bring down\r\nthe foods of Europe, America and Australia, running, of course, not\r\na little risk of ptomaine poisoning, positively ruining our stomachs\r\nforever, and becoming a permanent dyspeptic charge upon the nerves of\r\nthe long-suffering community! Now things are better. Here is a list\r\nof fresh foods procurable in the larger ports. In the plague, typhoid\r\nor cholera season, some eschew fresh vegetables, and again, when\r\nthey recall that the farmer is the town scavenger, some eschew fresh\r\nvegetables at all seasons! I quote the prices in gold, and give the\r\nChinese word your lordly cook calls out to the obsequious stallsman,\r\nso that the stranger may gain an idea that Chinese does not sound\r\nunmusical:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  MEAT\r\n\r\n  Beef sirloin, Mei Lung Pa, 10 cents a pound.\r\n  Beef steak, Ngan Yuk Pa, 10 cents a pound.\r\n  Mutton chop, Yeung Pai Kwat, 12 cents a pound.\r\n  Pork chops, Chi Pai Kwat, 10 cents a pound.\r\n  Chicken, Chu Yau, 8 cents a pound.\r\n  Duck, Ap, 15 cents a pound.\r\n  Doves, Pan Kau, 7 cents each.\r\n  Geese, Ngoi, 13 cents a pound.\r\n  Turkeys, cock, Phor Kai Kung, 20 cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  FISH\r\n\r\n  Barbel, Ka Yu, 5 cents a pound.\r\n  Carp, Li Yu, 9 cents a pound.\r\n  Cod, Mun, 7 cents a pound.\r\n  Crabs, Hai, 9 cents a pound.\r\n  Cuttlefish, Muk, 6 cents a pound.\r\n  Eels, Conger, Hai Mann, 7 cents a pound.\r\n  Frogs, Tien Kai, 20 cents a pound.\r\n  Garoupa, Sek Pan, 28 cents a pound.\r\n  Halibut, Cheung Kwan Kup, 12 cents a pound.\r\n  Lobster, Lung Ha, 18 cents a pound.\r\n  Mackerel, Chi, 16 cents a pound.\r\n  Mullet, Chai, 10 cents a pound.\r\n  Parrotfish, Kai Kung, 8 cents a pound.\r\n  Pomfret, white, Pak Chong, 13 cents a pound.\r\n  Salmon, Ma Yau Yu, 16 cents a pound.\r\n  Shrimps, Ha, 12 cents a pound.\r\n  Soles, Tat Sa, 12 cents a pound.\r\n  South China is rich in fish, and I could quote scores more.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 FRUIT\r\n\r\n  Almonds, Hung Yan, 9 cents a pound.\r\n  Apples, Chifu, Tin Chun Ping Khor, 7 cents a pound.\r\n  Bananas, fragrant Canton, San Shing Heung Chiu, 1½ cents a pound.\r\n  Carambola, Yeung Tuo, 4 cents a pound.\r\n  Cocoanuts, Yeh Tsz, 5 cents each.\r\n  Lemons, Ning Moong, 4 cents a pound.\r\n  Lichees, Lai Chi, 5 cents a pound (called “Chinese nuts”).\r\n  Lily roots, Lin Ngan, 3 cents a pound.\r\n  Limes from Saigon, Sai Kung Ning Moong, 3 cents a pound.\r\n  Pears, Canton, Sa Li, 4 cents a pound.\r\n  Peanuts, Fa Sang, 5 cents a pound.\r\n  Persimmons, Hung Chie, 10 cents a pound.\r\n  Pineapples, Sheung Poon Ti Pau Lau, 5 cents each.\r\n  Plantains, Tai Chen, 1 cent each.\r\n  Plums, Swatow, Hung Lai, 5 cents a pound.\r\n  Pumelo, Siam, Chim Lo Yau (grapefruit), 5 cents each.\r\n  Walnuts, Hop Tuo, 6 cents a pound.\r\n  Watermelon, Sai Kwa, 1½ cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               VEGETABLES\r\n\r\n  Beans, sprouted, Ah Choi, 2 cents a pound.\r\n  Beets, Hung Choi, 1 cent each.\r\n  Brinjal, Ching Yuen, 2 cents a pound.\r\n  Cabbage, Kai Choy, 2 cents a pound.\r\n  Carrots, Kam Shun, 3 cents a pound.\r\n  Chilies, Red Hung Fa, 3 cents a pound.\r\n  Cucumbers, Ching Kwa, 1 cent each.\r\n  Garlic, Suen Tau, 3 cents a pound.\r\n  Ginger, young, Sun Tsz Keung, 3 cents a pound.\r\n  Corn, Suk Mai, 2 cents each.\r\n  Lettuce, Yeung San Choi, ½ cent each.\r\n  Onions, Sang Chung, 2 cents a pound.\r\n  Papaw, Tai Man, 5 cents each.\r\n  Potato, sweet, Fan Shu, 1½ cents a pound.\r\n  Spinach, Yin Choi, 2 cents a pound.\r\n  Tomatoes, Kan Ker, 3 cents a pound.\r\n  Vegetable marrow, Chit Kwa, 1 cent a pound.\r\n  Water cress, Sai Yeung Choi, 5 cents a pound.\r\n\r\nThe table is justly famous at the following, among other hotels and\r\nclubs, and the wines are as cheap as in Europe, because no duty is\r\ncharged at Hongkong, and only five per cent. in China. In Japan,\r\nhowever, and in French China there is a heavy duty on foreign liquor.\r\nThe Grand Hotel and the club, at Yokohama; the club, Kobe; Wagon Lits\r\nand club, Peking; Imperial Hotel and club, Tientsin; Astor House and\r\nclub, Shanghai; Peak, Grand, Craigieburn, Hongkong and Astor Hotels and\r\nclub, at Hongkong; Victoria Hotel and club, Canton; Boa Vista, Hing\r\nKee and club, at Macao. When you go there, next time, tourist, ask\r\nfor broiled samli or Sek Pan at Macao; toasted rice birds or Ap ducks\r\nat Shanghai; Mongolian mutton at Peking; roasted imperial pheasant at\r\nTientsin; preserved comquats in ginger syrup, Hungyan almonds, and Sai\r\nKwa watermelons at Canton; Hung Lai plums at Swatow; Tin Chun Khor\r\napples at Chifu; fresh lichees or Phor Kai turkey at Hongkong, and ruby\r\nred persimmons at Yokohama. It is not well to be a gourmand always, but\r\nit is well to be an epicure on eminent occasions, so as to remember\r\nthem forever, from fear that, as in Senator Ingalls’ poem, “Opportunity\r\nknocks but once.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nFOREIGN CITIES OF CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nAt all the great treaty port cities and colonies, such as Hongkong,\r\nShanghai, Canton, Macao, Tientsin, etc., the stranger is accosted by\r\ncrowds of rickshaw coolies, venders, fortune-tellers, flower sellers,\r\netc., urging his patronage. Efforts are being made to limit this noise,\r\nwhich is at present like the reception that a football hero gets when\r\nhe wins a game. The Chinese think we like the attention, because so\r\nmany of us smile, and if one looks cross, a native wit will call out:\r\n“Don’t ask Honorable Sad-Face to ride; he has just lost his white\r\nmother-in-law, and must demurely walk behind her ghost.”\r\n\r\nThe first motor-car used in China was brought to Hongkong by an\r\nAmerican dentist in 1900. It was a storage electric vehicle, as the\r\nauthorities prohibited for a while the use of gasoline on account of\r\nthe fire risk. Gasoline cars and launches are now used throughout\r\nthe treaty ports, but kerosene engines are preferred in motor-boats.\r\nKerosene can be procured anywhere in China, but gasoline is procurable\r\nonly within a limited area.\r\n\r\nAs a foreign steamer enters a port, a fleet of sanpans throw out hooks\r\nand grapple with the ship. This picturesque nuisance the authorities\r\nare trying to stop, on account of the danger to life which is involved.\r\nThe hotel runners, gamblers, and venders desire to be over the rail\r\nbefore any passengers leave. The health authorities desire to stop the\r\nirrepressible boarders as much as the harbor masters do. The boarders\r\nshout out to their countrymen: “You there! Throw over a fastened rope;\r\nwe want to kotow to you on board, and leave you some of our money in a\r\nlittle game.” Over the rope goes, despite the frantic mate, who is a\r\nwhite man, and like ants, the agile Chinese clamber up the sides of the\r\nbig trans-Pacific or Suez liner.\r\n\r\nPeking, Haukau, Tientsin, Shanghai, Ningpo, Hongkong and other cities\r\nof China all have fine race courses, club-houses and stables. In hot\r\nHongkong the racing, gymkana and polo meets occur from September to\r\nApril. Szechuen and Mongolian ponies, Australian and Indian horses are\r\nused, but few American or British, the cost and insurance risk for\r\nthe latter being too great. Every white man, singly or in clubs, goes\r\nin for the “king of sports”, and from a military point of view this\r\ninterest in racing is very advantageous. The betting is generally on\r\nthe French method of Paris Mutuels, where those who bet on the winning\r\nanimal divide the pool, less eight per cent. for club expenses. The\r\nChinese are beginning to understand the horse, and mafoo-jockeys and\r\ntrainers are being developed. Up and down the China coast the owners\r\nship their champion racers, and the interport rivalries are keen in\r\nthis, and every other sport. The main ambition is for the owner to\r\nride his horse as a “gentleman-jockey” in the crowning Derby event,\r\nand quite a few Hebrew and Parsee owners enter their horses in a\r\nwidening sporting fraternity, which not long ago was limited to Saxons,\r\nand which may yet include Chinese gentry. The stocky Mongolian pony,\r\nweighing fifteen hundred pounds, only covers the mile in two minutes\r\nand eight seconds, and being hard of mouth and stubborn, he is as\r\nlikely as not to cover the mile the opposite way to that which has been\r\nprescribed by the stewards! Not only has Hongkong two very fine\r\ngolf courses, but Canton, Macao, Hankau, Shanghai, Peking, Tientsin,\r\nand other treaty ports have excellent courses famous for their novel\r\nbunkers of tombstones, etc., and club-houses. During most of the year\r\nat Hongkong the game is played on the Wong Nei Chong course shortly\r\nafter daylight, as after eight o’clock the overhead sun is too hot for\r\nthat exercise which is essential if one expects to keep “fit” in the\r\nOrient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright, 1913, The Bobbs-Merrill Company.\r\n\r\n  The mountain palaces of Hongkong; clouds almost cover the great\r\n    peaks.

The immense new\r\n    railway development of China has been put under the direction of\r\n    the Honorable Sun Yat Sen.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMany have asked what was the organization of the crown colony of\r\nHongkong Island, where 3,000 white troops, a navy, 2,000 Indian troops,\r\nand 500 British, Indian and Chinese police guard and rule 3,000 white\r\nmen and 500,000 Chinese so successfully that after paying her own\r\nexpenses, Hongkong continues, what she was the first colony to offer,\r\nto pay to the British government a large sum for military and naval\r\nexpenses. The government is organized under the Home Colonial Office,\r\nas follows: a governor, the general of British troops in China, a\r\nlocal colonial secretary, an attorney-general, a colonial treasurer,\r\na director of public works, a registrar-general, a superintendent of\r\npolice, a clerk of councils, four white civilians, and two Chinese\r\ncivilians, the six latter serving mainly for the honor. The famous\r\nSanitary Board serves as a separate commission. Almost every one will\r\nadmit that this is a compact, graftless, powerful and very economical\r\norganization, and it has more than answered expectations in a worldwide\r\nfame, both for Britain and China. The able newspapers of the ports are\r\nthe Opposition, and keep the government up to efficiency. There is\r\nonly one flaw, which may soon be remedied. There should be a director\r\nof education, for the purpose of honoring education, and not because\r\neducation is backward in the progressive colony, which has had so\r\nmany hero governors and cultured heads of department. Their great\r\ndeeds would fill volumes as yet unwritten, for the many authors who\r\nhave lived and served at Hongkong have not written of themselves.\r\n_In modestia magnus!_ Hongkong has had some famous regiments in its\r\ngarrison, musical and sporting life. After the South African War the\r\nRoyal Welsh, Derbyshire and Lincolnshire regiments came. In 1911 the\r\nnoted Yorkshire Light Infantry were in garrison. Their fine bands,\r\noften massed with the Indian regiments’ bands, are the feature in the\r\nmusical life of the royal colony. The Yorkshires served in garrisoning\r\nthe foreign settlement on Shameen Island, Canton, when, following\r\nthe revolution of 1911, the pirate chief Luk seized the forts around\r\nCanton. Over at Kowloon, the mainland section of the colony in 1860,\r\nwas mobilized the army of Sir Hope Grant’s 13,000 British troops and\r\nBaron Gros’ 6,000 French troops for the Taku-Peking campaign, and\r\nthough the existence of their nation was at stake, the southern Chinese\r\ndid not make a protest against this mobilization on what was then\r\nChina’s territory.\r\n\r\nThe municipal organization at Amoy is seven councilmen, two of whom are\r\na clergyman and a physician. They employ a captain-superintendent, and\r\na judge who sits in a “Mixed Court” with a Chinese mandarin. American\r\nnaval officers were given warm receptions by the Chinese of Amoy when\r\nthe battleship fleet went round the world in 1908. The island-dotted\r\nand hill-surrounded harbor is one of the finest and most beautiful in\r\nChina, and there is a great future before the port. At one time it was\r\nthe largest tea port in China. The foreign settlement is on the hilly\r\nKulangsu Island. The streets to see are Likin, Temple, Bootmaker, etc.\r\nThe native Chamber of Commerce entertained the visiting members of the\r\nAmerican Chambers of Commerce in 1910 in the Nan Pu Tu Temple. There\r\nare notable clubs and theaters; the Kwan Tai and other temples. The\r\nscenery is famous for the Valley of 10,000 Boulders, a sort of “Garden\r\nof the Gods”, in which the Deified Rock is worshiped. Many of the\r\nboulders are engraved by nature-worshipers. Note should be taken of\r\nthe dainty architecture of the White Stag Temple and gates. The London\r\nMission at the boat landing has partially adopted the Chinese style of\r\narchitecture in the up-curling cornices. Forts which have seen hard\r\nservice are placed on the hills. The foreign race course and jockey\r\nclub is under the hill where the noted Lampotah Temple stands. Amoy\r\nis particularly famous for the best oysters, coolie oranges, pumeloes\r\n(grapefruit), fish, game, sugar, ginger and grasscloth in China. At\r\nAmoy stone buildings are seen everywhere, and extend southward through\r\nFukien and Kwangtung provinces. The natives, who have a little Arab\r\nblood, and who often wear turbans as well as hats, are tall, turbulent,\r\nhumorous and curious. There is much infanticide, because the small\r\nfarms are only able to support sons. Amoy is connected by railway with\r\nChangchow on the Lung (Dragon) River, and it is planned to have a coast\r\nrailway connecting all these cities from Shanghai to Canton. There is\r\nalmost daily steamship connection with Hongkong. Native Amoy City is on\r\na large island. The walls, which climb straight up the hills, are about\r\neight miles around. The city was taken by the republicans on November\r\n12, 1911, and there were many subsequent engagements with pirates when\r\nAmerican marines from the _Monterey_ had to be landed. Centuries ago\r\nthe people of this province offered the most stubborn resistance to\r\nthe Manchus when that dynasty conquered China. The dialect is the most\r\nisolated in China, showing that the northern ruling Chinese influenced\r\nthe people very slightly. To instance:\r\n\r\n  In Fukien               In Mandarin\r\n  ----------              -----------\r\n   Hokchiu                  Fuchau\r\n   Amoy                     Hsia-men\r\n   Quemoy                   Chinmen\r\n\r\nThough the port was formally opened to foreign trade in 1842, the East\r\nIndia Company had hongs here as early as 1661 and up to 1730.\r\n\r\nThere is much for the antiquarian to trace as he follows the\r\ntraditions of Arab visits in centuries preceding the Portugese\r\ndiscovery, at Canton. We hear reports that St. Thomas, the disciple,\r\nand Mohammed’s uncle journeyed here, taking the route none ever has\r\nsince, across Persia, India and Burma. The tourist should not fail\r\nto visit the noble park of thousands of examination stalls, where\r\nthe old classical learning held rule from Confucius’ time until\r\nrecently. There is evidence enough that the state has grasped the new\r\neducational conditions recommended by the great Emperor Kwang Hsu, and\r\nthe Cantonese reformers, in the splendid Kwangtung normal college,\r\nwhich consists of two wings and a tower building in the style of the\r\nUniversity of New York. A noble stucco wall, pierced with portholes,\r\nsurrounds the college. There is also the Canton Christian College,\r\nestablished in the fine Martin Hall. It is supported by Americans.\r\nAmerican statesmanship and philanthropy will miss their glorious\r\nopportunity if they do not soon erect at Canton the preparatory\r\ndepartment of a comprehensive American-Chinese university, the higher\r\nclasses to be at Peking or Nanking. Trace should also be made of\r\nthe factory of Milner & Bull, of New York, which sheltered Robert\r\nMorrison in 1807, when he was preparing for his immortal translations\r\nand dictionary. This was the time when American tradesmen of New\r\nYork, Philadelphia and Boston showed keen sympathy with statesmanship\r\nand learning. Olyphant & Company, of New York and Canton, backed the\r\nprinting of the priceless _Chinese Repository_, and brought fifty\r\nmissionaries free from New York in their famous clipper ships. The\r\nBoston merchants who ran regular lines in those days to Canton, and had\r\nfactories there, were Forbes, Perkins, Cabot, Sturgis, Russell, Cushing\r\nand Coolidge.\r\n\r\nThe morbid will want to see the execution ground in the Thirteen\r\nFactories section. It has no rival as the bloodiest spot on this earth.\r\nGovernor Yeh, of Kwangtung, during the Taiping rebellion in October,\r\n1856, beheaded 100,000 rebels here, and during the pirates’ attack\r\nunder Luk, at Canton, in March, 1912, executions were part of each\r\nday’s work here. The ground is small and insignificant looking, and\r\nwhen not legally in use is used for spreading pottery in the sun. This\r\nThirteen Factories section is in rather bad odor as an entertainer\r\nof opium smugglers and counterfeiters. Confucius’ temple near the\r\nExamination Park should not be missed, not for its beauty, but for\r\nits significance in the national ethics of so many centuries of one\r\nuninterrupted idea. The Parade Ground, under the eastern wall of the\r\nold city, should be visited, for here the nucleus of China’s new army,\r\nwhich we will some day hear much of, is training. China must learn\r\nto marry martial force and productive mechanics to, what through the\r\nlong ages she has been preeminent in, literature, agriculture and art.\r\nIn the western suburbs, the looms of the silk weavers, the native\r\nhospital, the Temple of Longevity, and the Temple of Five Hundred Genii\r\nare of exceeding interest, and if one can go as far as the White Cloud\r\nHills there is the historic spot to see, where Morrison baptized, in\r\n1804, Tsai Ah Ko, the first Protestant convert in China.\r\n\r\nVarious other places of interest are Tsiang Lan Kiai (Physic Street),\r\nwhich is protected from the sun with matting; Ma An Street, where the\r\nshoe shops are; Book Store and Jade Streets, with their tea saloons;\r\nthe Hall of Green Tea Merchants radiant in porcelain; the Pok Chai\r\nnative hospital; and the public gardens which were confiscated from\r\nthe rich salt merchant, Pun Shih Cheng, because he evaded the law by\r\nsmuggling, etc. China first prophesied that restitutionary besides\r\nprohibitive laws will yet be adopted world-wide to straighten out the\r\neconomic tangle. Many modern improvements have come to Canton, such as\r\na wide modern bund, electric cars and light, water, sanitary buildings,\r\nhospitals, etc. The University of Pennsylvania and the American\r\nPresbyterian Women have notable medical establishments at Canton,\r\nwhich city is connected with the early life of Doctor Sun Yat Sen, who\r\nhas become immortal by formulating the republican Chinese rebellion\r\nand nation. Canton is already a railroad center, having rails east to\r\nHongkong, south to medieval Macao, and north toward Hankau, and she\r\nproposes to link up west by running a railroad to Nanning and Yunnan.\r\nThere is a vast steamer and launch traffic to Hongkong and up the West\r\n(Si) and North (Pe) Rivers, and along the iron-bound coast. Canton is\r\nthe largest and most representative city of ethnical, republican and\r\ncommercial China. Its stores and small factories are decidedly the most\r\nnotable, efficient and varied in the wide land. The foreign settlement\r\non Shameen Island in the Pearl River has every luxury in the way of\r\nmodern clubs, hotels and residences, and in the native city there are\r\nclubs where the foreigner and native gentleman are trying to approach\r\nnearer to each other. Canton has two dialects, the Cantonese and the\r\nHakka, and I know of no better authority on them than my old friend,\r\nDyer Ball, the veteran author and linguist of Hongkong, though Canton\r\nhas had many famous foreign students among her foreign residents in\r\nexile. The curious Hakka tribe composes one-third of the inhabitants\r\nof Canton. They can be distinguished by vivacity, by the flat hat with\r\nvalance, worn by the women, and by their love of jewelry. The sanpan,\r\njunk, slipper boat and launch people, the most distinctive feature of\r\nCanton’s life, are largely Hakka. For further information regarding\r\nthis tribe, which is also largely in evidence at Hongkong, Amoy and\r\nSwatow, I would recommend Dyer Ball’s authoritative books. _Dutch Folly\r\nIsland_ commemorates an early settlement of trading Hollanders.\r\n\r\nThe writer in his book, _The Chinese_, dealt at length with the oldest\r\nforeign settlement in China, the Portugese city of Macao, and its\r\nfamous author, Camoens, who wrote _The Lusiads_. Authors who have\r\nwritten on quaint medieval Macao are Doctor Eitel, Norton Kyshe,\r\nMontalto de Jesus, Kutschera, Ljungstedt, the famous Sir John Bowring\r\nand the immortal Camoens himself. The largest library on the subject\r\nis to be found in the National Libraries of Lisbon, Coimbra, and other\r\neducational centers of old Portugal. The first American consuls lived\r\nat Macao, as did also the noted Jesuit explorer Abbé Huc, in 1840, in\r\nthe seminary here. The British artist, Chinnery, lived and painted at\r\nMacao, as did the lovely Chinese colorist, Nam Cheong. Edmund Roberts,\r\nthe first American ambassador of the United States “to Siam, Cochin and\r\nMuscat” died of bubonic plague here on June 12, 1836. In a study of\r\nMacao the old volume of the _Chinese Repository_ should not be left\r\nunsearched. In a temple at Wang Hiya, beyond the quaint Porto Cerco\r\ngate, the first commercial treaty between America and China was signed\r\nrespectively by Cushing, Daniel Webster’s son Fletcher, and Ki Ying.\r\nThe remarkable miniature garden at the governor’s summer palace on the\r\nMonte Road should be seen, and rather amusing miniature photo statues\r\nare to be seen in the cemeteries. The largest cement factory in China\r\n(British owned) is on Green Island, which is connected by a causeway\r\nwith Macao. The silted up harbor is being dredged in an effort to\r\nbring the long lost shipping back to old Macao. There is to be railway\r\nconnection with Canton, and there is palatial steamer connection with\r\nHongkong and Canton. The modern hotels, such as the Boa Vista and the\r\nHing Kee, are excellent, the former occupying an unusually scenic\r\nsite. The drives and Praya Grande are delightful. Macao is famous for\r\nits medieval carnivals and processions. It has an ambitious Chinese\r\npopulation whose leading spirits are the progressive Ho Sui Tin\r\nand Fong families. Its gambling houses are possibly notorious, and\r\nits opium farm, now somewhat restricted, was once a great thorn in\r\ninternational and hygienic matters.\r\n\r\nOff the three-mile limit at Kowhowyang anchorage, the smuggling\r\nsteamers occasionally lie. The trouble between Japan and China over the\r\n“Tatsu Maru” incident, and the subsequent severe trade boycott, which\r\nnearly bankrupted a Japanese trans-Pacific steamship and coastal line,\r\nwill be recalled. The Chinese and Portuguese are constantly at swords’\r\npoints over harbor questions and the inclusion of the large islands of\r\nLapa, Joao and Taipa in the beautiful colony, which would have been\r\nrushed long ago by the Chinese but for fear of Britain which supports\r\nPortugal “for auld acquaintance’ sake” and the memories of Wellington’s\r\npeninsular campaign when Portugal assisted Britain in her need. Chinese\r\nand Portuguese gunboats are always watching each other in the rather\r\nturbulent waters.\r\n\r\nLovely flowery Macao, of fast and festival, is the favorite health\r\nresort of Hongkong, because of its sou-west monsoon in the summer\r\nmonths. The wave of the Portuguese republican revolution took a month\r\nto reach Indian Goa and Cathayan Macao. The newspapers were read by the\r\nsoldiers in the two beautiful barracks which stand high over Cape Sao\r\nFrancisco and beneath Monte Fort. They were then loaned to the sailors\r\non the gunboat _Patria_ which rose and fell on the yellow tide in the\r\noffing. On November 29, 1910, the sailors of the _Patria_ landed,\r\nmarched to the square where the Senato Leal stands on high ground\r\non Rua Central in the center of the closely built city. There three\r\nvolleys were fired as a signal to the troops who, a mile away, broke\r\ninto the armories and armed with ball cartridge ready for liberty’s\r\nbusiness! The Legionaires Regiment first proceeded to the Santa Clara\r\nConvent, drove the nuns to the steamboats lying in the inner harbor,\r\nand forced them to sail for Hongkong, forty miles away, the objection\r\nto the long intrenched religious orders being that they successfully\r\ncompete with business by not paying taxes. Then the revolutionists,\r\ndragging cannon, marched to the artistic government “Palais” on the\r\npicturesque Praya Grande, where the governor and representatives of\r\nthe Senato Leal were forced at the bayonet’s point to agree to the\r\nexpulsion of favored religious orders, the establishment of a republic\r\nin Portugal and her colonies, the suppression of the oligarchic and\r\nreligious organ, _Vida Nova_, and similar reforms obtained by the\r\nrepublicans in Portugal. Most wonderful to relate, as a new sign\r\non the horizon of the twentieth century, the Chinese viceroy of\r\nKwangtung province brought up his Chinese army to stand by and see\r\nthat order elsewhere was maintained while European revolutionists,\r\nEuropean monarchists and reactionary Catholics fought out questions of\r\nrepresentative and popular government in a corner of the sacred soil of\r\nold China. Correctly speaking then, it was little historic Portugal,\r\nand not ancient China, that first established a republic on Chinese\r\nsoil, and Portugal’s republican influence, _multum in parvo_, as well\r\nas America’s and France’s, has been influential with Chinese reformers.\r\n\r\nFuchau, the capital of turbulent Fukien province, is situated\r\ntwenty-five miles from the coast on one of the most romantic rivers\r\nof China, the Min. “Fu” means happy, and is the most used word in\r\nsuperstitious China, if we except perhaps a “strange oath” or two,\r\nand the family name Chang, which almost half of the Chinese carry.\r\nThis city lies in a river plain surrounded by a glorious amphitheater\r\nof hills. With Hongkong, Fuchau joins as the two most scenic ports\r\nof China. The wide walls are thirty feet high, ten miles around, and\r\nup a mountain on one side, and there are seven fort gates, the most\r\nnotable being the North Tower, with its curious spirit shrines. The\r\nmost noted temples are those to the goddess Kwan Yun, the God of War,\r\nand Ching Hwang Temple. The seven-storied White Pagoda is famous. It\r\nhas Romanesque doors and stunted galleries with railings. It is more\r\nponderous than beautiful, and is remarkable for its great antiquity.\r\nThe city is a noted educational center, missionary and native, It was\r\na reform center even back into the Dowager Empress Tse Hsi’s day in\r\n1897 and 1898, and produced its martyr, young Lin, who fell a victim\r\nof that reactionary Jezebel. Six miles south of the city on Ku-Shan,\r\n1,700 feet high, is the noted Bubbling Well Monastery. The chair ride\r\nthere affords a wonderful view. Fuchau is a health resort, as it has\r\nmany hot springs. The Pacific Coast Chamber of Commerce was entertained\r\nby the city guilds at the Nan Pu Tu Temple in October, 1910. The valley\r\nof boulders is notable, as are also the rich pumelo groves. Fuchau used\r\nto be a great tea port. The trade declined from 1898 to 1907, but it\r\nis picking up again with the increased demand for China teas. Pagoda\r\nIsland exhibits a severely plain and ancient pagoda and some remarkable\r\nPai Piku (white stern) junks of the olden time. An ancient bridge nine\r\ncenturies old, with sixty arches, on which are many overhanging shops,\r\npropped from the piers, connects one of the islands.\r\n\r\nFuchau went over to the rebel provisional government in October, 1911,\r\nbut the Manchu city was not captured until a month later. There is a\r\nnaval arsenal here, a dock, navy school, mint and a foreign settlement\r\non Nan Tai Island. The climate is extremely trying.\r\n\r\nMany unique costumes and turbans are to be seen. Fukien province people\r\nhave some Arab blood in them, though the Mohammedan religion has been\r\nlost. They boast that they have never been conquered, and that many of\r\nthe notorious pirates are Fuchau men. Their women wear a head-dress\r\nthat looks like the model of an air-ship. There are excellent Methodist\r\nand Congregational schools, an American hospital, and a fine London\r\nmission which has done what missions should do in architecture. It has\r\nadopted to a degree the characteristic and beautiful Chinese style.\r\nAll the missions and foreign trade buildings should strive to retain\r\nthis wonderful art instead of daring to bring square ugliness or Greek\r\ncoldness of column to artistic China, where it does not fit well in\r\nso warm a land. Down at the seaside bamboos are placed in the beds so\r\nthat the oysters may cling to them. There are factories for glass\r\nfiligree lamps. Trips should be made to the Yuan Fu Monastery, built\r\non props on Wu Hu (Five Tiger) range, and up to which five hundred\r\nsteps have been cut; the Paeling tea hills, fifteen miles north; the\r\nolive and orange groves; and the hot mineral springs. Fuchau is to have\r\nrailway connection north and south. With Soochow, Fuchau is the center\r\nof the lacquer art, and old specimens are highly prized. In 1885 the\r\nFrench fleet under Admiral Courbet sailed into Fuchau and battered\r\nat the forts and the city, virtually compelling the Chinese for the\r\ntime to cede the great province to Tonquin. This is what the Chinese\r\ncall the “Sacrilege of Fuchau”. The city is also the center of tinfoil\r\nworkers, their product being used in great quantities in making the\r\ngold and silver models which are burned at the graves. Beautiful heavy\r\nwall paper is also made. The noted sinologue, Professor Parker, of\r\nManchester University, the witty author of _John Chinaman_, etc., was\r\nonce British consul at Fuchau.\r\n\r\nNingpo (Peaceful Wave) in friendly Buddhist Chekiang province, could\r\nbe called the Azalea City, and is one of the most delightful and\r\npicturesque cities of China. It is the second oldest in its relations\r\nwith Europe, the Portuguese having founded a trading settlement here\r\nin 1522. The city is moated, and the walls are broken with six gates.\r\nOld Krupp cannons lie about on the parapet. The best wood carvers,\r\nmasons, and varnish makers of the kingdom work here, and their services\r\nare sought for all over China. Its artists also are famous. Ningpo\r\nlies twelve miles from the sea at the head of the Tatsieh River.\r\nThree streams branch out into the hills, which lie spread around in\r\na most picturesque panorama, including valleys, canals and lakes. It\r\nis a great fishing center, and its sailors are venturesome. The fast\r\nriver slipper boats of Ningpo are noted far and wide. The inhabitants\r\ndo not disdain the use of such a modern thing as ice, as the many\r\nstraw-covered, peaked ice houses show. Much tea and silk are produced.\r\nExcellent stone carving is done, as witness that gem of architecture,\r\nthe Fukien men’s Guild Hall, with its carved dragon-entwined columns,\r\ncomical stone lions, and splendid, up-curving tiled roofs. The screens\r\nand bronze urns at the many temples are also a delight in this center\r\nof culture, the new rights of women, engineering and commerce. There\r\nare successfully run native cotton mills, and the district produces\r\nfine matting, rice, oils, varnish, sepia, bamboo, lumber, tea, game,\r\nflowers, rape, barley, tallow trees, etc. There is a curious street\r\ncovered with pailoo arches to widows who would not remarry, to\r\nscholars, children, etc. There is a foreign quarter with its splendid\r\nbund, race course, house boats, clubs, churches, hill bungalows, etc.\r\n\r\nNo Chinese city affords more delightful excursions to the hills,\r\nwaterfalls, rapids like the Wenchow, and the wonderful Buddhist\r\nmonasteries like the noted Tien Dong and the Shih To. The trips to the\r\nTa Lang and Snowy Valleys are exceedingly beautiful. Outside the city\r\nthe temple to the sailor’s patron goddess, Ma Tsu Pu, at the east gate,\r\nis particularly fine in lines, proportion, dignity and rich detail. It\r\nwas erected in 1680 by sailors of Fukien, the neighboring province.\r\nThese precious old temples are the last precious gems of a great age\r\nin art. The new times in learning, religion, politics and commerce\r\nare bringing in an ugly architecture. Ningpo is strongly influenced\r\nin Buddhism by the nearness of Phu Tho Island of the Chusan group.\r\nThere is a quaint pontoon bridge over one of the streams. It has shops\r\nupon it, and is the center of a fair. The women of Ningpo are known\r\nfor their fine needlework, and the old schools were celebrated for\r\ntheir men of letters among the literati officials. The old Tien Fung\r\npentagonal pagoda is perhaps the oldest in China, dating back 1,200\r\nyears. Its gold and white tiles have fallen, and the brick and mortar\r\nwork of the seven stories is exposed.\r\n\r\nPolitically, Ningpo is progressive. It went over to the “Han Republic”\r\nrebels on November 5, 1911. In the early days of the Portuguese at this\r\nport, the Ningpo men rose up, destroyed thirty-five Portuguese ships,\r\nand slaughtered eight hundred of the crews, because they claimed the\r\nforeigners had gone inland and captured Chinese women on the Sabine\r\nplan. The city was captured by the Taiping rebels in 1862. Off Ningpo\r\na fierce engagement between the Chinese and English fleets took place\r\nin October, 1841. Nimrod Bay, near Ningpo, is to be the central base\r\nfor the new Chinese navy. In the turmoil of 1898, when the nations\r\nof Europe were striving to partition China, despite the protests of\r\nAmerica and Britain, the French, on July 16th, landed marines at Ningpo\r\nand tried to take a temple graveyard for a settlement, incidentally\r\nadding twenty Chinese to the number to be buried in the graveyard!\r\nNingpo is soon to have a railway connection with the west and south.\r\n\r\nHangchow, the capital of Chekiang province, is famous as the city of\r\nthe Roaring Tidal Bore. The walls are twelve miles around. The bore\r\nis best seen at Haining pagoda, east of the city. The tourist should\r\ngo at moonlight to see the unforgettable white specter riding in on\r\nthe wheels of the night. The legend is that the Wu prince, Tse Hsu,\r\ncommitted suicide, and the Chinese go to the bore to see him sweeping\r\nby in his fury. The stone-faced river wall has stone cradles built for\r\njunks to outride the terrific main bore. The city has railway and canal\r\nconnection, and launch tows are now much used instead of sail. The\r\nGolden King Hill is in the center of the city by the lake side. It is\r\ncrowned with a Buddhist temple. The lake has a causeway, lake temples\r\nand pagodas. The city is famous for its beautiful waterscapes, like the\r\nview of Western Lake (Si Hu), and the view from Thundering Peak Tower\r\n(Lui Fung Tah). This tower is without the usual ornate galleries, and\r\nshows the Arab influence which crept up the coast in the old days, and\r\nestablished itself at Hangchow in mosques, etc. Three separate attempts\r\nwere made to capture China for Mohammedanism; they were made in Kansu,\r\nYunnan and Chekiang provinces. The Red Imperial Palace at the lake side\r\nwas once the center of the cultured Sung dynasty, thirteenth century.\r\nMarco Polo visited and praised the beautiful ancient city as follows:\r\n“Beyond dispute, it is the finest and noblest city in the world.” It is\r\nnow a center of the silk, wine, fan, lantern, tea, tinfoil, camphor,\r\nhardware, book, vegetable oil, etc., trade. The city was captured\r\nby the republicans on November 5, 1911, the Tartar city strongly\r\nresisting. With Soochow, it is called the most fashionable city, and\r\nthe home of the best dressed women of China. Doctor Main’s model leper\r\nhospital is here. The American Presbyterians have erected on a lovely\r\nhillside over the water a number of buildings of the important new\r\nHangchow University. The Tartar walled city is on the northwest. There\r\nare a governor’s yamen, many pailoo honorary arches, the massive Great\r\nPeace Bridge, canals, famous temples, shops and fine residences, for\r\nthe Chinese of this section seem to have a civic pride. The rolling\r\nsuburbs of Hangchow are the most beautiful in China, reminding one\r\nperhaps of England’s lake country. The modern parliament buildings\r\nof the province of Chekiang are erected at Hangchow. There is also a\r\nnative university and normal school.\r\n\r\nNanking, the largest walled city of the Ming emperors and Taiping\r\nrebels, and the first republican capital and assembly headquarters, is\r\nvery dear to the hearts of the Chinese race. It is the center of the\r\nclassic Mandarin pronunciation used by the north and the cultivated\r\nof all China. The name translated means southern capital. The great\r\nYangtze River sweeps beneath the walls, and the city has canal and\r\nrailway connection of the finest. The city, as was discovered when\r\nGeneral Chang defended it, is commanded by the peaks of Purple Mountain\r\non the north. There are fortified hills within the city, and great\r\navenues down which run modern electric cars. Ruins of the last pure\r\nChinese dynasty remain: the Ming palace, the picturesque tombs, and\r\nan avenue lined with wonderful gigantic camels, lions, elephants,\r\netc., similar to the Ming Avenue at Nankow on the Great Wall above\r\nPeking. Emperor Hung Wu’s monument is a stone monolith, erected on\r\na gigantic turtle’s back. The tomb itself is square. In the same\r\nmanner that the Japanese and Russians unavoidably pounded the Manchu\r\ntombs at Mukden with shot, the imperialists and republicans pounded\r\nthese revered Ming tombs in 1911. Bloody General Chang’s slaughter\r\nof the republicans and non-combatants at Nanking in November, 1911,\r\nwill be hissed at in history forever. Viceroy Chang Jen held the\r\nfirst Chinese exhibition at Nanking in 1910. He established water,\r\nelectric and gas works, and broad roads, and was in many ways a most\r\nenlightened leader. The foreign settlement is in part on Siakwan\r\nIsland. Across the river on the north at Pukow, a British railway goes\r\nto Tientsin and Kiaochou, and south to Shanghai runs the splendid\r\nShanghai-Nanking British railway, the best built road in China. As\r\nusual, the city is divided into Tartar and Chinese sections. There are\r\nmilitary and naval colleges, a native provincial university and an\r\narsenal. Nanking Union University of the Methodists and Presbyterians\r\nis famous, and is discussed in another chapter. The students have\r\nadopted athletics and propose to send a team to Olympic games. The\r\ncity has famous pagodas and temples, like the Pi-Che-Ko, the Buddhist\r\nTemple of Ten Thousand Gilded Gods, the White Star Temple, etc. The\r\nTaipings burned the famous yellow and white porcelain pagoda which\r\nonce stood here, and which was the most ornate pagoda in China. Some\r\nof the tiles are in the Metropolitan Museum, New York. American firms\r\nhave established themselves, and consulates, churches, clubs and all\r\nthat goes with foreign life will now come up to the favorite city of\r\nrepublican China, whose ancient culture hangs like a golden cloud\r\nover its memories. There are newspapers, paper mills, silk and satin\r\nfilatures, fan and cotton factories, shoemakers, tailors, porcelain\r\nkilns, etc. The city gave its name to the shiny cotton, “Nankeen”,\r\nused throughout China and Europe. Ink, flower, bath, vase, tile, book\r\nand jewel makers abound. Its artists are skilled. In the days of the\r\nold-style examinations, thousands of candidates used to gather in the\r\ngreat park of brick stalls. Nanking became a viceregal city when it\r\nceased to be the southern capital. Its guilds and boards of trade are\r\nfamous and progressive; each has its fine hall. Industry, learning,\r\npolitics, foreign trade and medicine will henceforward take a mighty\r\nhold at Nanking, where the first provisional president of China, the\r\nworld-wanderer, Doctor Sun Yat Sen, bowed to a modern representative\r\nassembly on January 1, 1912.\r\n\r\nShanghai is the queen of middle China, the ruler of the Yangtze River,\r\nat whose gates she sits. It is often called the “Paris of the Far\r\nEast”, which remark refers to its social life, for it is not nearly so\r\npicturesque as its rival, Hongkong, or that queen of beauty, Fuchau.\r\nThe fine black sand, once yellow loess, and saturated clay bed under\r\nShanghai is four hundred and fifty feet thick. For the large modern\r\nbuildings, it is necessary to sink a heavy girder-reinforced concrete\r\nraft, and build the structures on that. Even these buildings sink five\r\ninches as compared with the foot that ordinary pile and brick buildings\r\nsink. Life is in a whirl at Shanghai. The river bund is crowded,\r\nand so is the long, winding Bubbling Well Road. The concessions are\r\nsplendidly managed from a foreign point of view, and vie with each\r\nother in public spirit. The Chinese, however, feel greater warmth for\r\nHongkong, which gives them representation on the council. In Shanghai\r\nthere are mixed courts, consular courts, an American Superior Court,\r\nand Chinese courts. The Chinese are planning for the day when they\r\nwill try all Chinese offenders. There is an imposing cathedral, and\r\na modern Venetian style railway station. Good libraries, magnificent\r\nclubs, theaters, hotels of all nations, taxicabs, electric trams and\r\nrickshaws are among the conveniences. The separate post-offices of\r\nall nations are somewhat confusing. All the sports,--racing, golf,\r\ntennis, shooting, house-boating, swimming, etc.,--may be enjoyed, and\r\nthe military enthusiast has almost the same opportunity that he has at\r\nproud brave Hongkong. The Shanghai settlements protect themselves with\r\nthe Municipal Volunteer Guard, in which a special corps of Europeanized\r\nChinese can be enrolled. Secret societies, both foreign and native,\r\nhave their temples. Shanghai has been the chief center of the native\r\nreform newspapers which agitated from the time of the coup d’état of\r\n1898 to the rebellion of October 10, 1911, and at Shanghai the peace\r\nconferences between the south and the north were held in January,\r\n1912. Outside of iron and coal, one can see here almost all of China’s\r\nefforts to equal the Occidental in industrial activity in modern\r\nmills. The Japanese are in strong evidence at Shanghai in ownership\r\nof Chinese cotton manufacturing. In speculating, no city can approach\r\nShanghai. The awful rubber collapse of 1910 mowed down Chinese as well\r\nas foreigners. A military band plays in the public gardens and in the\r\nhotels. The musical and literary life of the colony is well developed.\r\nOn North Honan Road is the immense plant of the Commercial Press which\r\ntranslated a million dollars’ worth of text-books last year for China’s\r\nschools. Its president is Chang Yuan Chi. The English newspapers of\r\nthe port are known world wide for their scholarliness, and the Chinese\r\npress is making a mark for its patriotism and progress. The Bubbling\r\nWell Road cemetery and the Pahsien (Catholic) cemetery contain many\r\nmelancholy monuments of famous foreign pioneers. In meteorological\r\nscience, the Sicawei Observatory, under the control of the Jesuits, is\r\n_facile princeps_; indeed in this field this order has led in China\r\nand in the Philippines since the eighteenth century. Shanghai shares\r\nwith Hankau the title of head of the railway system; that is to say\r\none is the New York and the other the Chicago of the land. There is no\r\ncomputing what the future trade will be at Shanghai. The climate is not\r\nmuch improved on the damp sea-level misery which one experiences at\r\nHongkong, Canton, and Amoy, but there are brave hearts in Shanghai, and\r\nthe noblest of women who will endure any physical torture so long as\r\nthey know that they are doing their duty in not deserting the advanced\r\nfiring line of civilization and philanthropy.\r\n\r\nThe leading educational institution is St. John’s University, managed\r\nby the American Episcopalians. Nothing but praise can be accorded\r\nto it, and its future will be great. Already great men in China,\r\nsuch as Alfred S. K. Sze, once named as minister to Washington, and\r\nDoctor W. W. Yen, once secretary of the Foreign Board, are saying:\r\n“I am a St. John’s alumnus.” The university is five miles from the\r\nbund landing. Other missionary and native educational and medical\r\ninstitutions, like the Nan Yang University, are of a high order.\r\nThe intellectual life is advanced, for at Shanghai live most of the\r\nOccidentalized Chinese and retired officials.\r\n\r\nA great arsenal is located here. There is some abandon in the French\r\nquarter, which tolerates perhaps the lowest opium joints in the world,\r\nand the Foochow Road exhibits its brothel life the most brazenly of any\r\nstreet in the world. The dives of native Shanghai have been notorious\r\nthe world over for disappearance of victims.\r\n\r\nThere are wonderful silk shops on Nanking and Foochow Roads; luxurious\r\ntea gardens, fine temples like the Pan Tuck Ih and the Kwang Sang Kee;\r\nsplendid furniture shops; guild halls like that of the Shansi Bankers;\r\nthe Yu Yuen gardens, etc. The Hong Ku market should be visited early in\r\nthe morning, and the wonderful products of a rich district, intensively\r\nfarmed, will surprise a stranger. The place is famous for its houseboat\r\ntrips. The boat people are called Tankas, the tribe coming from Kiangsu\r\nprovince. They are related to the old Hongkong Hakka tribe. Wonderful\r\nfarms can be studied on Tsun Ming Island. Interesting pagodas, like\r\nthe Ta Kong, are to be seen. It is the theatric custom of the Germans\r\nto erect over the earth monuments to their dead who have fallen when\r\nin conflict with other races; this explains the “Iltis” monument.\r\nShanghai, soon to be the center of a vast railway development, was\r\nthe first apostle of railways for China, the noted old Jardine firm\r\nbuilding a railway to Woosung, twelve miles away, as far back as\r\nthe 60’s. The Manchus, who have always been reactionaries at heart,\r\npromptly tore it up and stacked it to rust out in distant Formosa\r\nIsland. The native city is not large, nor are the moated walls\r\nsubstantial, brick instead of stone being used. There are six double\r\ngates of iron. Manila was the first city of the Far East to tear down\r\npart of its walls and Shanghai will probably be the second. The Taiping\r\nrebels of the 60’s captured the city, and the population went over to\r\nthe revolution in November, 1911, thus depriving the effective Admiral\r\nSah of the Manchu navy of his ammunition, which Shanghai arsenal had\r\nfurnished up to that time. As Shanghai grows she will probably extend\r\ntoward her port, Woosung, twelve miles away, and a Conservancy Board\r\nmust arrange for vast expenditures to prepare for a large steamship\r\ntonnage now that the Pacific ocean is narrowing because of faster\r\nsteamers being put on the route. Imported goods for China are mainly\r\nstacked in Shanghai’s godowns, not even subsidiary stocks being held at\r\nports as far away as Newchwang. This practise must change somewhat and\r\nShanghai take particular care of the Yangtze valley, which is a kingdom\r\nof 150,000,000 people in itself.\r\n\r\nThe quaint Kiangsu junks are disappearing, and vast fleets of launches\r\nand mere cargo junks have come into use. To see the picturesque old\r\nlife on the waters, one must now go farther inland. Shanghai is famous\r\nfor its peony, chrysanthemum and lily gardens. It is a florist’s\r\nparadise, because it lies in the valley of the sun. Its dress show on\r\nthe bund and Bubbling Well Road, Hong Kew Park, Public Gardens and\r\nJockey Club grounds, almost rivals in silk the floral creations of\r\nnature. Some of the costumes are amusing. A tall Sikh, “bearded like\r\nthe pard”, and wearing an immense red turban, comes along the road\r\nwith never a look to right nor left and never a smile on his eager\r\nface. His gown looks like a loose white nightshirt, over which he has\r\nforced a small tight vest of bright colors and flashy buttons. The\r\nnightshirt is gathered in about his legs, which are bare below the\r\nknee. On his feet he wears Punjab slippers, which curve up at the\r\npoints like a gondola. So he fareth forth into the perpetual comedy of\r\nthe Shanghai streets and maloos! The London “bobby” looks at him but\r\ndoes not arrest him, because on official occasions this same Sikh is\r\nthe bobby’s partner on police duty, when, however, he buttons himself\r\nwithin a decent blue tunic and dons long trousers, though the turban is\r\nmaintained to him for tradition’s sake.\r\n\r\nAll the foreign banks, the Hongkong bank, and the Chinese National and\r\nShansi banks, have branches here, and it is proposed to have branches\r\nof large Chinese-American banks and steamship companies. Fault must be\r\nfound with the modern native as well as the European architecture of\r\nShanghai, that they are not perpetuating and adapting the extremely\r\nbeautiful Chinese style in roof, screen, portals, columns, terminal\r\nornaments, panels, pavilions and approaches. We of the Occident\r\nare barbarians to intrude in any land and debauch its beautiful\r\narchitecture in the way we are universally doing. All praise to some\r\nof the missionary societies, that as usual they are the first to do\r\nright in a beautiful way by building in the Chinese manner in China. A\r\nGrecian building like Boone University, at Wuchang; a top-heavy German\r\nbuilding like those at Kiaochou; a New York cave building like some\r\nat Tientsin; a British barn like some on the praya at Hongkong, even\r\nan Italian Renaissance like some on the Shanghai bund, are a trespass\r\nunto architectural sacrilege in artistic China. Let us keep to the\r\ngalleries, the curved lines, the rich roof, the colored panels, the\r\nenameled tiles of pagoda and temple as we raise stone on stone in\r\nglorious old China, for she is the mother of the arts, and has sat\r\nlongest at the fountain of beauty, if not at the anvil of arms.\r\n\r\nThe extension of the American post-office to Shanghai, whereby a\r\nletter can be sent from Shanghai to New York for two cents gold is\r\na remarkable achievement, and speaks much for the generosity of the\r\nChinese Revenue Board in permitting this heavy competition. Many of\r\nthe other nations have post-offices, but the rates are higher. The\r\ngreat international Opium Commission, its chairman the American,\r\nBishop Brent, which did the impossible by disenthralling a hundred\r\nmillion habitués from the pythonic toils of opium in two years, sat in\r\nShanghai in February, 1909, in its most memorable conference. The chief\r\ncredit is due to America for leadership in the altruistic sentiment,\r\nand to China, Britain, India and Hongkong for the immense altruistic\r\nsacrifice of revenue. Now that the pipe and the poppy fields have been\r\nwiped nearly out, it remains for the nations to stamp out morphia, the\r\nhypodermic syringe and the drugged cigarette. And poor China is not the\r\nmaker of these infernal tools. Shanghai has a modern water, an electric\r\nand street making plants, which are being copied through China as fast\r\nas funds can be collected by the municipalities.\r\n\r\nFor a long time it was impossible to escape quickly from the deadly\r\nsummer climate, but railways and steamships have placed the inland\r\nmountain resorts of Kuling, at Kowkiang, 3,000 feet high, and at Mokan\r\nMountain within easy reach. Phutho, the famous Buddhist mountain\r\nisland, is also near enough for quick steamship service. Every\r\ndebilitated Shanghai dweller used to go to far Japan at great cost to\r\nrecuperate, but this expense will be less necessary, as these nearer\r\nresorts are opened up by a fast developing transportation service.\r\nKuling Mountain is a missionary resort. Before it was discovered\r\nbroken-down workers had to be sent to Japan or home on a furlough if\r\nthey were able to stand the long voyage and the boards were able to\r\nstand the expense. The work of missionaries is the hardest under\r\ndangerous pioneer conditions, and Kuling Mountain is enabling the\r\nmissionary quickly to restore herself or himself to efficiency without\r\nleaving China. The waters around Shanghai, including Seven Mile Lake,\r\nafford excellent facilities for house-boating. The municipality uses\r\ntall, red-turbanned Sikh police from India, as well as native Chinese\r\nlukongs, all under foreign officers. The docks, ways and engine shops\r\nof Shanghai, both foreign and native owned, are equipping the waters\r\nof Central China with small steamboats, though there is a strong\r\ncompetition from Hongkong, Japan and Britain, and some competition from\r\nManila. Shanghai can not set out thousands of lanterns on a dozen hills\r\n1,800 feet up in the night skies, as gorgeous Hongkong can, yet her\r\nmore intimate garden and house illuminations are famous in China. The\r\npoet may justly rave and sigh:\r\n\r\n “Oh! give me an eve in that fairy Cathay,\r\n  When a thousand near moons change the night into day.”\r\n\r\nEven the shop signs are lanterns. China is the home of that\r\nnonsputtering, cold vegetable tallow that makes the only perfect\r\nlantern candles. The silver shops rival those of Hongkong, Nanking and\r\nSoochow, but beware of the German and Japanese machine-made imitation.\r\nThe artist only can put his soul and a luck message for you into what\r\nhe makes slowly by hand; anything else is not an _objet d’art_. There\r\nare very fine bronze statues in Shanghai, and the pottery stores are\r\na delight. The market stalls are a mine of yellow, red and pink in\r\nall shades, for these sub-tropics are a hothouse of fruit: pumeloes,\r\npersimmons, mangostines, lichees, oranges, bananas and nuts. The grape\r\nand pear country is much farther north, even to Shangtung province.\r\n\r\nThere have been famous consuls at Shanghai, like Sir Harry Parkes,\r\nwhose statue is erected on the bund. He became British minister, and\r\ndid much for British diplomacy and world trade in Chinese wars. The\r\nfirst government of the rebellion of October, 1911, opened in Shanghai,\r\nwith Wu Ting Fang as foreign minister. Shanghai, like Tientsin and\r\nother river ports, has its great conservancy question in the matter\r\nof keeping the channel free from loess and sand silt. Dredging is\r\ninfinitely too expensive, and the wit of man has to be matched against\r\nthe will of tide and stream. At Shanghai the course seems to be to keep\r\nan immense tidal basin above the port, as at Seven Mile Reach, ready to\r\nassist the ebb tide with a flushing flow. A Department of Rivers and\r\nHarbors will yet be the busiest and have the largest budget in China.\r\nAt present, Conservancy Boards, assisted by loans and government help,\r\ntake care of the expensive and difficult work as best they are able.\r\nThe foreign engineers employed are exceedingly able men.\r\n\r\nSuchow, a walled city of ten miles in circumference, the Venice of\r\nChina, lies on the Grand Canal, northwest of Shanghai. It is the\r\ncenter of a population of several millions. The city is intersected\r\nwith canals, and has, among its gates, six unique water gates. Hills\r\nsurround the wide plain, which is picturesquely marked also with\r\ncanals and camel’s-back bridges. The city has long been famous for its\r\nculture, the beauty of its women, the rich designs of its imperial\r\nsilk looms, its artists, its luxurious gardens and its boat life.\r\nForeign settlements are both within the walls and in the suburbs.\r\nThe shops on Kwei Tsze, Dragon, Peach and other streets, manufacture\r\npaper, wall-paper, lacquer, horn, glass, porcelain, furniture, ivory,\r\ncotton, linen, iron, copper, etc. The city has launch connection\r\nwith the Yangtze ports and railway connection west to Nanking, north\r\nto Tientsin, and south to Shanghai and Hangchow. In addition to the\r\nwonderful sunken gardens in Shu Park, there are also public gardens,\r\nlibraries, modern schools, a governor’s palace, a famous monster\r\noctagonal pagoda overlooking a picturesque, sinuous, bridged canal, a\r\nmassive customs bridge, the South Horse bridge, twin Burmese pagodas,\r\nand in contrast with their richness, near by, a square Ink pagoda, a\r\nprovincial university, a Confucian temple, the very artistic South\r\nGate pagoda, statues in Tsang Lang pavilion, Mohammedan and Buddhist\r\ncemeteries. Modern architecture is represented by the American\r\nMethodist University, which has what the new Chinese particularly\r\nappreciate, a fine clock tower. It is a sign of the times in China,\r\nfor the old Chinese ignored exact time. The American Presbyterians\r\nhave a most important publishing and translating department in Suchow,\r\nwhich had much to do with germinating the wonderful New China, which\r\nin Suchow particularly was ready for the seed. Modern medicine is\r\nrepresented by Blake Hospital. The city was sacked by the Taipings and\r\ncaptured by General Gordon, whose victorious legions thundered through\r\nthe east gate. So great an authority as the Japanese Marquis Ito\r\ndeclared that the West never should have supported the Manchu against\r\nthe Taiping revolution; that the reforms of 1911 could have been\r\neffected in 1863. I humbly differ with this opinion, as Hung and Yang\r\nwere very different leaders from Sun Yat Sen and General Li Yuan Heng\r\nof the immortal revolution of October 10, 1911.\r\n\r\nAt Hankau, the first battlefield of the October, 1911, revolution, the\r\nfinest-developed foreign concession, running along the Yangtze River,\r\nis owned by Britain, but many of the lessees of the palatial homes are\r\nRussian tea merchants. All nationalities are admitted to the municipal\r\ncouncil of these model British settlements. Next to the British comes\r\na Russian settlement, with French, German and Japanese settlements\r\nfollowing. The Americans, as usual, club with the British settlement,\r\nwhich is generally called “The Settlement”. These concessions were\r\ngranted by the treaty of Peking and following treaties. Hankau has\r\nrailway connection with Peking, and it will be linked up with the other\r\ngreat centers west and south. The river connects it with the east,\r\nand a riverine railroad will eventually be run from Nanking, which is\r\nalready railed up with Shanghai. The burned native city of Hankau is to\r\nbe reconstructed as the model city of China. Wide parallel avenues are\r\nto run north and south and wide boulevards east and west. All blocks\r\nand squares are to be geometrical. This is an astonishing departure\r\nfrom the pig-path streets of the other native cities. The three cities\r\nat the junction of the Han and Yangtze Rivers, Hankau, Hanyang and\r\nWuchang, are one metropolitan district, as are Brooklyn, New York and\r\nJersey City. At Wuchang, in the barracks of the Eighth Division, the\r\nrevolution actually broke out in force, as far as the regular army was\r\nconcerned, on October 10, 1911, before it extended to Hankau. Wuchang\r\nwas the headquarters of the famous Viceroy Chang Chih Tung, the first\r\nof the conservative progressives, and one of the three viceroy props\r\nof the Dowager Tse Hsi’s throne for thirty-five years. He was the most\r\nhonorable old-style mandarin that ever ruled the provinces of China.\r\nThe city is walled and is divided by Serpent Hill, which will be\r\ntunneled. It has long been an educational center, the provincial native\r\nuniversity and modern schools being located here. Bishop Roots, of the\r\nOhio Episcopalians, founded the noted Boone University at Wuchang, and\r\nthe New York Episcopalians have St. Hilda’s Girls’ School. Stokes and\r\nThomas Hall, of Boone University, have Ionic Greek porticoes, which\r\nlook out of place in ornate warm China. The university draws its pay\r\npupils from the rich merchants and officials of Hankau. There is also\r\nthe Griffith John College of the London Mission, a normal school of\r\nthe American Baptists, a Swedish college; and Lord Cecil and Oxford\r\nand Cambridge Universities propose to start their great university\r\nhere. It is a garrison and arsenal city, and is famous for its bronzes\r\nand pagodas. On Flower Hill stands the famous three-story pagoda. The\r\nGerman firm of Carlowitz has established an antimony smelter, and there\r\nare extensive cotton mills, some of them now owned by Japanese bankers.\r\nThis red earth province is famous for its minerals, silk, tea, cotton,\r\npaper, wax and particularly for the political independence of its\r\ninhabitants, as the Eighth Division has immortally recorded in history.\r\n\r\nHanyang, a mile across the river, has the famous steel plant\r\nestablished by Chang Chih Tung. It is becoming one of the most\r\nimportant steel plants in the world, and Japan and Western America will\r\nnot call upon it in vain, as they are indeed now doing. Dock yards\r\nwill doubtless be established also. The American Baptists have a large\r\nhospital at Hanyang. Hanyang has an arms manufactory, a cannon foundry\r\nand a powder mill.\r\n\r\nMuch of Hankau was burned by those firebrands, the Imperial Third\r\nDivision, under General Feng, in November, 1911, a deed which the\r\nsouth will never forget, if they ever forgive, as it was entirely\r\nunnecessary. Many millions of property were destroyed in a land which\r\neconomically can not well afford the loss of one cent. The great city,\r\nwhich numbered over a million inhabitants, will be rebuilt on the high\r\nbanks sixty feet above winter level of the two rivers. The river rises\r\nover forty feet in summer. The Anglicans have established the church of\r\nSt. John the Evangelist, and the American Episcopalians have St. Paul’s\r\nand St. Peter’s churches. There are fine clubs, a race and a golf\r\ncourse, a foreign volunteer organization which has seen much active\r\nservice. There is also an English newspaper, the _Central China Post_,\r\nand many native papers. The Russians are prominent because of their\r\ntea trade. The steamship service is steadily growing, Hankau being at\r\nthe head of steamship navigation. Lighter boats are taken for Ichang.\r\nThe railway connects with Peking, and soon railways will run south,\r\neast and west, and a bridge will cross the Yangtze River on the road to\r\nCanton and Singapore. The Deutsche-Asiatische Bank, the Russo-Asiatique\r\nBank, other foreign banks, consulates and foreign traders, are housed\r\npalatially. The great walled city is the most famous in China for its\r\ntrade and provincial guilds. As in old London, the trades have gathered\r\non one street, or in one district. Hankau is and will be the trade and\r\nindustrial hub, the Chicago of China, and here foreign firms should\r\nlocate without delay. The pioneer names connected with Hankau are\r\nBishop Ingle, whose splendid tomb can be seen in the foreign cemetery,\r\nand Archibald Little, the explorer, author, tea trader, and the first\r\nforeigner to run a steamer from Hankau to Chungking through the\r\nterrific rapids of the glorious gorges between Ichang and Wan Hsien.\r\n\r\nIchang is the advance post on the Yangtze for the commercial attack\r\non the Chingtu, Chungking and far western trade. It is at the head\r\nof navigation, and is sending out its railway to conquer the gorges\r\nand rapids. There is a walled riverine city up seventy feet of\r\nstairs; a foreign settlement; golf course, to be sure; Episcopal trade\r\nschools; clubs; consulates; Established Church of Scotland Mission;\r\ninteresting temples and pagodas. Ichang has for immemorial years been\r\nthe headquarters of perhaps the bravest boatmen in the world, the Hupeh\r\ntrackers and sailors of the gorges. Read a hundred books of travel and\r\nyou have their story. Here also is the headquarters of China’s red\r\nlife-boat service, an effective and daring company of men. Hupeh can\r\npoint with pride to such material in brawn and courage, on which to\r\nbuild a provincial parliament or assembly. There are notable guilds in\r\nIchang.\r\n\r\nChifu, on the gulf of Pechili, is a noted bathing resort for foreigners\r\nfrom all over the Far East. There is a splendid foreign quarter, with\r\na well-appointed club, churches and hotels. The view of the many\r\ncone-shaped purple hills, the bluest of seas and yellowest of sands,\r\nwill not quickly be forgotten. There are islands which invite boating,\r\nsuch as Temple and Lighthouse Islands. The finest fruit in China,\r\nsuch as grapes, pears and apples, is grown at Chifu. The stock was\r\nbrought from America by Doctor Nevius and other missionaries in the\r\n80’s. There is also a tree-cranberry, the Red Fruit (Hung Kwo). Worms,\r\nfed on oak leaves, produce the famous tough Chifu silk, which is as\r\npopular in China as abroad. Chifu was known for its blockade runners in\r\nthe Russian-Japan War of 1904–5. In the famous engagement of August,\r\n1904, several Russian warships from Port Arthur broke through Admiral\r\nTogo’s iron-bound investiture, and reached Chifu, but the Japanese\r\nbroke in, and despite international law, abducted the Russian torpedo\r\nboat destroyer _Reshitelni_. The other Russian vessels they torpedoed\r\nin the Chinese harbor. Chifu has a naval college of modern equipment.\r\nThe district produces straw braid in great quantities for the hats of\r\nthe fashionable women of the world, and her other products of beans,\r\npeanuts and vegetable oils are well known. Gold and coal are found\r\nnear by, and many vessels call for coaling. Missionary societies are\r\nactive, and have a wide opportunity, for this is the home province of\r\nConfucius and Mencius, and the inhabitants have a literary, political\r\nand inquiring turn of mind. The Chinese of Chifu are noted for their\r\nheight, as compared with the busy little men of the southern provinces,\r\nwhom we know in America and Britain. Many of them emigrated to South\r\nAfrica in 1904 for a six years’ indenture, when they were all returned.\r\nChifu is to have railway connection with the German and Chinese roads\r\nto the south and west. The city went over to the revolutionists\r\non November 10, 1911, and a republican column, reinforced by the\r\nrepublican navy, operated from here against the imperialists at the\r\ncapital, Tsinan. Not far from Chifu, at Wei Hai Wei, the British keep a\r\nstrong garrison on China’s soil.\r\n\r\nTsingtau, in Shangtung province, is a German port, and a colonial\r\nexperiment which has attracted much attention because of the experiment\r\nof Henry George’s “single-tax-on-land” plan, in its effort to attract\r\nimprovers of land, and spread out, instead of congest cities. In 1898\r\nthe Germans forced a lease of it at the same time that Russia occupied\r\nManchuria. The Japanese drove the Russians out of Manchuria, which\r\nthey have largely occupied themselves, treaties notwithstanding,\r\nbut no one has driven the Germans out of Shangtung, the most sacred\r\nof the provinces of China. It was largely this German seizure that\r\nprecipitated the “Boxer” massacres in 1900 under the secret instigation\r\nof the Empress Tse Hsi. The port and main colony is two hundred square\r\nmiles in area, but the most remarkable (the only one of its kind\r\nexcept that of the Japanese in southern Manchuria) concession is that\r\nof sixty miles wide and two hundred and fifty miles long from the\r\nport back inland to Tsinan, the illustrious capital of the province,\r\nwhich dates back to 1100 B. C. Through this land the Germans have\r\nbuilt a strategic railway, by which they could cut off communication\r\nbetween the northern and southern provinces. The Chinese have never\r\nforgiven and will never forgive this affront. It is therefore one of\r\nChina’s many unsettled questions. The bay is fifteen miles long by\r\nfifteen miles wide, surrounded by hills from 1,500 to 3,000 feet high,\r\non which the Germans have planted forests in fine style. The ocean\r\nboulevard is one of the five most scenic roads in the East, the others\r\nbeing Hongkong’s Jubilee Road, Macao’s Cacilhas Bay Boulevard and the\r\nManila Luneta and Baguio Roads in the Philippines. The entrance to\r\nthe commercial harbor at Ta Pu Tao is two miles wide. Fortifications,\r\ndocks, godowns, railways with patented iron sleepers, hotels, banks,\r\nhospitals, statues, magnificent homes, educational institutions for\r\nboth Germans and Chinese, have all been set out in characteristic\r\nGerman methods. It was by this railway that the imperial troops were\r\nprovisioned in November, 1911, when the revolutionists had cut off\r\ntheir ammunition at Shanghai, Hanyang and Nanking arsenals, and the\r\nChinese have not forgotten this, claiming that with all their criticism\r\nof the “Yellow Peril” the German foreign office, at the beginning of\r\nthe revolution, was at heart pro-Manchu. The port was made a free port\r\non the pattern of Hongkong, and while a larger trade has developed,\r\nTientsin (with her port, Taku) holds her place in the competition.\r\nWithout the railway to Tsinan, Tsingtau could not hold her own as a\r\nshipping center.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright, 1913, The Bobbs-Merrill Company.\r\n\r\n  Spirited photograph of the turning tide, Pearl River, Canton.\r\n    Speedy slipper boats, sanpans, junks; modern steam launch. These\r\n    launches are rapidly transforming China’s transportation in the\r\n    south.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright, 1913, The Bobbs-Merrill Company.\r\n\r\nWider maloos, or roads, are being broken through the cities by tearing\r\ndown the shops on one side of the way.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright, American Episcopal Church, Foreign Board, N. Y.\r\n\r\nA vigorous game of Association football at Boone (American) University,\r\nWuchang, Central China. Note the interested crowds.]\r\n\r\nThe sympathy between the natives and the foreigner which exists\r\nat Newchwang, Tientsin, Shanghai and Hongkong, is lacking at stern,\r\nmilitary, exotic Tsingtau. Yet the Germans have set a splendid object\r\nlesson in the precision and strength of the Tsingtau municipal\r\nestablishment. The fine German navy is always in evidence, and the\r\nfiner German army is everywhere. Many German industries have been\r\nestablished, and are run with as grim a determination, being backed by\r\nthe “syndicates”, when they are losing money as when they are making\r\nit. German merchants seem to thrive better, and prefer to keep their\r\nstocks at the many international settlements, where trade has followed\r\nnatural channels. The coal wealth at Poshan and elsewhere, which the\r\nGerman railway has developed, is enormous, but the Chinese are bitter\r\nthat the profits, on the principle of “all the traffic will bear”, all\r\ngo to Germany and not to China. It is noticeable, in contrast with the\r\nBritish occupation of Hongkong and other colonies, that the Germans\r\nhave not kept the Chinese names for the hills and bays. Tsingtau has\r\nsplendid rail and ship connection north and south. Among the exports\r\nto Europe are the famous silk and straw braid of the province, egg\r\nproducts, black pigs, coal, wheat, millet, sorghum, maize, beans in\r\nparticular, peas, hemp, copper, iron, antimony, asbestos, silver,\r\nsulphur, gold, rugs, the famous liu-li vitreous crockery of wonderful\r\ncolors, castor oil, peanuts, fruit of excellent quality, etc. Years ago\r\nthe German gunboat _Iltis_ was lost in a typhoon while trying to make\r\nthis port, where the Germans were later to establish themselves in a\r\nrivalry with Russia’s aggression in Manchuria.\r\n\r\nTientsin, the great port of Peking, is another concession city, where\r\nthe various nations keep their civilizations and military and naval\r\nforces bright for the inspection of the Chinese, who live contiguous\r\nin a walled city, where Li Hung Chang and his protégé, Yuan Shi\r\nKai, made their names famous as viceroys and intermediaries between\r\nOrient and Occident. The city is at the head of the historic Grand\r\nCanal. Its river, the Pei Ho, runs up toward Peking. It has splendid\r\nrailway connection west, south and north. The national railways of\r\nNorth China are managed here under the direction of Jeme Tien, Doctor\r\nWang and Chang Kee, with foreign advisers like Mr. Kinder and Mr. Pope\r\navailable. Rich coal mines, especially the famous old Kaiping, are\r\nnear, and there is a vast export of this product, as well as of carpet\r\nwool, camel’s hair, camel’s-hair rugs, jujube preserves, etc., for the\r\nworld. As it is a most important banking center, a great amount of gold\r\nis handled. Concessionaires have flocked here, eager for privileges,\r\nand the game has opened anew. Foreign troops have grounded their arms\r\nhere more than at any international port in China.\r\n\r\nOn account of its flat surroundings, Tientsin is the least picturesque\r\ncity of China. There is a recreation ground, Victoria Gardens, native\r\ngardens, a race course around a graveyard, a jockey club, much\r\nsociety, naval and military life, theatricals, and facilities for the\r\nmany athletic, swimming, boating and skating clubs. Except in summer\r\nthe climate is charmingly dry; the wind and sand storms are greatly\r\nfeared, however. The loess dust is as penetrating as the alkali dust\r\nof Arizona. A British military cemetery has many melancholy monuments\r\nof the foreigner’s occupation of an alien land, where disease and\r\nthe casualties of many famous bombardments have mowed down their\r\ncostly toll. There are electric cars, electric light, gas and water\r\nplants, fine clubs, churches, consulates, missions, a Y. M. C. A.,\r\nthe magnificent Gordon Hall, science and military colleges of the\r\nbest, hospitals, native and foreign schools of all grades, excellent\r\nroads like the bund and Tai Ku, fine fur, silk and pottery shops. The\r\nEnglish newspapers like the _Times_ and _China Critic_ are important,\r\nand many Chinese papers like the _Ching Wei Po_ are very influential\r\nin the coming New China. There is much foreign military music, and the\r\nnatives are learning the delightful art, the viceroy’s band already\r\nbeing clever. Many Chinese have made their names here under foreign\r\ntutorship, Yuan Shih Kai and Tang Shao Yi, for instance; and Li Hung\r\nChang held forth here in his yamen on the river bank in his most\r\ninfluential days. The Pei Yang University is the best native modern\r\nuniversity in China. The medical school trains with foreign help,\r\nwhat China needs most at the moment, native physicians and nurses.\r\nThe port, more than any other, has for many years had a restraining\r\ninfluence on the Manchus. Without it, no one knows what the reactionary\r\ndynasty would have promulgated in the way of edicts. Tientsin is\r\ninteresting for its wonderful colored clay images, its excellent rugs,\r\nits salt heaps, its fish-pies and hot potato pedlers, who shout their\r\ngoods along “Eternal Prosperity” and other native streets. There is\r\ninteresting French life on the Tai Ku Road in the French settlement.\r\nThe native walled city is a model in Chinese municipal government, as\r\nfar as activity and order, but not so far as beauty is concerned. Among\r\nthe many steamship lines, the native China Merchants (a government\r\nline) has a branch here. A Conservancy Board has much work cut out for\r\nit by the Pei Ho bar which hampers the growing shipping. The National\r\nChinese Posts and Telegraphs have branches. There are native temples,\r\nand mosques for the Mohammedan Chinese, who have absorbed the old\r\nHonan Jewish Chinese. Tientsin is very hot, and the summer resort for\r\nbathing is up the coast of Pechili Gulf at Pei-Tai-Ho, where the Great\r\nWall meets the sea. This is the water resort also for the Pekingese\r\nforeigner and foreignized native.\r\n\r\nThere is much industrial activity, and Tientsin, with its million of\r\ninhabitants, will be a great center for the import of machinery for\r\nthe rich provinces of Pechili and Shansi and the vast territory of\r\nMongolia, as it will also be the port for the mining and agricultural\r\nwealth of those rich provinces, including chilled meats, millet,\r\nsugar, flour, wheat, beans, fruit, nuts, skins, furs, vegetable oils,\r\nores, etc. In some respects the possible new ports of Chin Wang Tao,\r\nChung How So, and Jinkow, on the Gulf of Pechili, could compete with\r\nTientsin. The Peking (British) Syndicate, of Shansi, and the Chinese\r\nEngineering and Mining Company, of Pechili, with their immense\r\ncapitalization of $6,000,000 and $5,000,000, respectively, operate and\r\nmake loans from Tientsin, and, as in all the ports, there are many\r\nland, coal, iron and milling companies, in which Chinese have shares.\r\nThe tendency is to grant fewer franchises to foreigners, and let the\r\nChinese exploit their own wealth in mines, transportation and public\r\nservice, buying only from the foreigner the necessary machinery, and\r\npaying only to the foreigner a proper interest for loans, instead of\r\nthe immense bonuses and concessions that have often been obtained.\r\nThe tendency to water the stock of public service corporations and\r\nmonopolies so as to hide the immense earnings from an overcharged\r\npublic is creeping into China, and will be attacked by a courageous and\r\nindefatigable government. Tientsin is one of the two places (Peking\r\nbeing the other) from which it is most convenient for tourists to set\r\nout to see the Great Wall of China, the world’s grandest monument. The\r\nrailway takes the tourist about one hundred and twenty miles along\r\nthe Pechili coast to Shan Hai Kwan, where the wall meets the sea,\r\nand turning back climbs the vast mountain ranges, to the speechless\r\nwonder of the sightseer. One of the Chinese proverbs on this subject\r\nis: “Those who have seen least, stare most!” There are more Jews (not\r\nthe lost colonies of Chinese Jews absorbed by the Chinese Mohammedans\r\nof Honan, Kwangtung and Kansu provinces) in business at Tientsin than\r\nat any port in China, not excepting Hongkong. In the warehouse of the\r\nAmerican Trading Company, at Tientsin, six hundred men of the Fifteenth\r\nUnited States Infantry were quartered in the stormy days of the first\r\nmonths of 1912.\r\n\r\nPeking stands at the end of the great seacoast plain as you go\r\nup from Tientsin by railway or by boat. Beyond rise the Hsi Shan\r\n(Western Mountains) and the Mongolian plateau and mountains. It is\r\nthe most expansive city in the republic, because it is more built\r\nup than spacious Nanking; a court, a legation, a trading, an art,\r\nan educational, a health center in autumn, a military, but not a\r\nmanufacturing center as yet, though it will be. It is more Mongolian\r\nand Manchu, perhaps, than pure Han Chinese. It is splendidly laid out,\r\nand with drainage and paved roads will attract fine equipages and even\r\ngreater wealth than now resorts there. It has a water system, electric\r\nlight, telephone, telegraph and railway service, wireless connection\r\nwith the coast, a modern railway station at the famous Chien Men gate.\r\nIts fine Gothic Pe-Tang Cathedral, strangely within the purple imperial\r\ncity, with its spires, looks as though it had been transported from\r\nFrance. Its porcelain temples are centers of wealth, if not of zeal\r\nand history. Its monuments, especially the city wall and gates, are\r\nthe noblest. Its pavilions, like those in the late emperor’s garden,\r\nare the most artistic in the land. It is comparatively modern among\r\nthe cities and capitals of China, going back only to 1150 A. D. as\r\na provincial and national center. Coleridge has sung of the city.\r\nKublai Khan, Marco Polo’s protector, was its first great emperor. The\r\ncreator of Ming monuments, the artistic Yung Lo, is its next greatest\r\nemperor, and it was he who gave the present stamp to Peking. Its most\r\nillustrious Manchu emperor was Kang Hi, the potter, to whom Louis XIV.\r\nof France, signed himself as “your most dear and good friend, Louis.”\r\nThe city is laid out on the plan of an immense Mongol camp of the\r\nplains, defense line within defense line three times, and not unlike\r\nCæsar’s plans when on the march. The trading section of the city is\r\nfilled with an immense gathering of camel, mule and pony trains, and\r\nthe new railways bring coal from east and south. A master hand could\r\nturn the great camp into a hive of modern industry. Some day, perhaps\r\nsoon, that will occur. The Peking market is well supplied by the\r\nMongols of the plateau and the farmers of the Pechili plain, not to\r\nspeak of what railways, canals and roads bring in from all points. More\r\nraces and varied costumes are seen at Peking than at any other city,\r\nand the teak-barred shops are treasure houses. The Tartar city faces\r\nthe north and in its center is the Forbidden, or Purple City, of the\r\nold Manchu court. Between the wall of the latter and the south wall of\r\nthe Tartar city are the Wai Wu (Foreign Office), legations, hotels,\r\nrailway station, banks, churches, missions, universities, hospitals,\r\nclubs, newspaper offices, shops, etc., all saying, according to the\r\nconservative Hanlin Chinese, in the words of our _Belle of New York_,\r\n“Of course you can never be like me, but be as like me as you’re able\r\nto be”. The union of Protestant medical missions at Peking, so as to\r\nform a hospital, medical college and nurses’ school of wide scope, has\r\nattracted nation-wide and world-wide attention. The beginning of the\r\nunifying of Protestants thus takes place effectively in the capital of\r\noldest China, instead of at Geneva, Berlin, London or New York.\r\n\r\nHow much of the modern and the old, the Oriental and the Occidental,\r\nare mixed up in this wonderful city? There are modern steam rollers;\r\ndonkey and camel trains, blue-turbaned couriers on Mongol ponies;\r\nspringless, hooded Peking carts, the mule wearing a velvet cloth;\r\nbouncing mule litters; camel trains swaying up and down like the\r\nbillows of the Yellow Sea; modern water tanks borne by steel towers;\r\na modern zoo with a dragon-carved gate; automobiles; victorias drawn\r\nby swift Mongol or black Szechuen ponies; Russian droshkes drawn by\r\nthree ponies going different paces; men tugging single-axle carts by\r\nlong ropes and harness; coolies with baskets and boxes balanced from\r\nthe bamboos on their sweating shoulders; wheelbarrow men transporting\r\nhuge bags of millet or salt; men throwing water on the streets with\r\nbig wooden spoons; rickshaws, and passenger chairs with ventilators\r\nand windows. There is a great military camp outside the walls. In the\r\nPortuguese cemetery outside of the west gate lie the famous Jesuits\r\nwho nearly made the Manchu dynasty Catholic in Kang Hi’s day. In the\r\nrevered British cemetery lie the bodies of the famous pioneers of\r\nour race, who, during the centuries, have fought forward the most\r\nadvanced line of our civilization. Many of the graves and memorials,\r\nthe trees and walls were desecrated in the “Boxer” outrages of 1900.\r\nThere is a cemetery for that notorious tribe of palace eunuchs in the\r\nnorthwest of the Tartar city, and sons had to be bought, or “forged”\r\nfor them so as to pay the necessary grave worship of Confucianism.\r\nThere is the new Peking Club, the second in cost in the Far East; the\r\nTsung Hua College, which trains students who are to go to America and\r\nEngland; and where the old examination stalls and the Hanlin College\r\nstood under the ancient “literati” system, are the modern parliament\r\nbuildings (Tzu Cheng Yuan); also National University, and the Wai Wu\r\nPu (Foreign Office) halls, where Yuan Shih Kai had his headquarters in\r\nthe exciting days of 1911–12. Towering over the Tartar city are the\r\nGothic towers of the French Pe Tang Cathedral, which was successfully\r\ndefended by Bishop Favier during the 1900 siege. The white marble\r\npailoo arch to the German ambassador, who was assassinated in 1900,\r\nis notable, as are also numerous other marble, porcelain and painted\r\narches, and marble bridges, balustrades and statues of lions. The\r\nstatue to the German was erected under foreign compulsion and is hated.\r\nThe wonderful street bazaars of Chien Men gate, Lung Fu Temple Street,\r\nwide Kaiser Street; the important Methodist and Union Hospitals of\r\nHatamen Street; Legation, Tsung Pu, Tung Tan, Liu Li, Koulan, Butcher,\r\nFan Tan, Lantern, Jadestone, Bamboo, Meridian and other leading streets\r\nshould be visited. There is a Peking Tiffany; the firm name is Hsing\r\nLung Tien. The city’s kilns and weavers are famous for their porcelain,\r\ncloisonné and tapestries. Pedlers, however, bring almost everything,\r\nfrom the cheapest to the costliest, to one’s door. There are many\r\nnative papers like the influential _Chun Kuo Pao_.\r\n\r\nSome of the legations have been rebuilt since the 1900 siege, the\r\nAmericans in particular occupying near the Chien Men gate a series\r\nof costly, but not architecturally proper buildings for artistic\r\nChina. The British legation near the Wu Men gate is notable for two\r\nreasons: because it occupies Duke Liang’s Chinese palace, and because\r\nits compound was the center of the foreigners’ quarters in the Peking\r\nsiege of 1900. The French legation rented Duke Tsin’s palace. In the\r\nsacred urns in the Temple Park in the south of the Chinese city, the\r\nbodies of the Sikh soldiers, who died or were killed in the 1900 siege,\r\nwere cremated. The Art Gallery in the imperial city is of particular\r\ninterest. The Lama (Tibet Buddhist) Temple, with its ornate pailoo\r\narch, should be seen. The priests wear orthodox yellow robes and hats,\r\nand a red cloak with squares, which represent the rags of poverty as\r\nrealistically as art cares to go. There is an immense statue of Buddha,\r\nand some small obscene statues which have been draped by the request\r\nof the legations, to the great and joyful surprise of the priests, who\r\nhave discovered that they are now able to make more money in fees than\r\nwhen the statues were undraped, so perverse is tourist curiosity! A\r\nwalk on the walls should not be neglected, especially where, between\r\nthe Chien Men and Hata Men gates the American, British and other\r\nforeigners made their long stand in 1900. The ponderous fort-temples on\r\nthe walls, with their interesting exhibit of columns and galleries, are\r\ncharacteristic. Red is the color of the Chinese, yellow and green the\r\ncolor of the Manchus, and the tiling of the roofs indicates where each\r\npredominates.\r\n\r\nPeking has its many military memories. In 1900 the Ninth and Fourteenth\r\nInfantry, the Sixth Cavalry and the Marines of the cruiser _Newark_ of\r\nthe Americans fought their way here from the coast in General Gaselee’s\r\nunion column of relief. The Wei-Hai-Wei Regiment of British Chinese\r\nin blue and white, came, too, with quotas from the forces of France,\r\nGermany, Russia and Japan. The Sun Wui Club brings leading Chinese and\r\nOccidentals together; that is, those Occidentals who have a maximum of\r\ngood sense and national ambition and a minimum of out-of-date, insular\r\n“snobbery”. We once had a similar international club in Canton, which\r\ndid good work in destroying difference and welding approximation.\r\nThe Russian Mission in the Pei Kwan section of Peking is almost the\r\nonly effort of the vast Greek Church to missionize China. Good music\r\nis now available, for both the National Customs and native armies,\r\nand all the foreign legations have trained bands, and there are some\r\norchestras. The Union Medical College and Hospital on Hatamen Street\r\nis most notable, not only because of its effectiveness, but because\r\nthe various evangelical denominations have first united in far away\r\nChina. Some writers, like Lord Salisbury’s son, Lord Cecil, think this\r\nis the forerunner of union elsewhere. The example has been copied\r\ngenerally in China, as at Nanking, Tsinan, Canton, etc., and before\r\nlong all medical, hospital and teaching work will be on the union plan\r\nin all the large centers. The Chinese are eager to assist, and join in\r\nwith a whole heart. Reform started in Peking in 1898, when Kang Yu Wei\r\nand other Cantonese, trained at Hongkong, got the ear of the Manchu\r\nemperor, Kwang Hsu, and induced him to issue the famous reform edicts.\r\n\r\nThe peony gardens are notable, and the courts and gardens of the many\r\ntemples, inside and outside of the walls, exhibit many horticultural\r\ntreasures, but Northern China in general is more notable for wild\r\nflowers than hothouse products. There are Manchu tombs, and the Manchu\r\npalaces and gardens of Yuan Ming, Wan Shou and Ih Ho to the northwest\r\nto visit, and temples in the western hills, where the foreigners\r\nresort during the blazing summer of the plains, if they do not care to\r\ntake the railway down to the bathing resort of Pei Tai Ho, or Chifu.\r\nThe scenic railway running north takes one to the glorious Nankou\r\npass in the Great Wall and to the Ming tombs. The station is at Liu\r\nTsin outside the walls. To the northwest are the villages where\r\nthe Manchu pensioners or bannermen were kept in idleness, which was\r\none cause of the 1911 rebellion. As in many of the Chinese cities,\r\nthere is a clepsydra water clock to be seen. Mints, banks, engraving\r\nplants, printing presses, electricity, modern water-works; primary,\r\nintermediate, trade and high schools, have all come to the reforming\r\ncapital. There have been large hoards of bullion in the imperial city.\r\nThe empress dowager, Tse Hsi, left many millions of silver, which were\r\nused to run the government for weeks during the rebellion in 1911–12.\r\nThis money was collected by the eunuchs, compelling every official to\r\npay for his daylight audience and honors, and crimes were “planted”\r\non officials so as to have the excuse of fining them and thus adding\r\nto the Manchus’ imperial reserve. Great granaries exist where the\r\ntribute rice from the southern provinces was stored for a million or\r\nmore subsidized Manchu soldiers and hangers-on. This rice formerly\r\ncame to Tientsin and Peking by the Grand Canal and Pei Ho River.\r\nIt was later brought north, through Li Hung Chang’s intervention,\r\nby the China Merchants’ Steamship Company, in which the government\r\nheld the majority of the shares. The history of spying, intriguing,\r\nconcession-hunting and diplomatic contests swells its largest at\r\nPeking, and old Legation Street and the Wai Wu Pu have heard perhaps\r\nmore secret stories than any other diplomatic quarter of the world. Men\r\nof all nations, Manchus and Chinese, eunuchs, women, human parrots,\r\ndictographs secretly placed, waste-paper baskets, keys to private\r\ncodes, the kitchen cabinet, keyhole sentinels, tapped telephone wires,\r\nfield-glasses masked behind curtains, letter sweaters and those adders\r\nin the bosom, society detectives, have all had their part in the old\r\nPeking game of intrigue. Foreign trusts have come over the water to\r\nbattle with local distrusts! Understanding has not always honestly\r\nwooed misunderstanding. Evasion has alternately successfully and\r\nunsuccessfully battled with invasion. “When is a promise not a promise”\r\nhas been answered by, “At Peking, on both sides of the ethnological\r\npale”.\r\n\r\nCulture, learning, fashion and fools have often mixed in the\r\ndrawing-rooms which face Legation, Meridian and Great Wall Streets. In\r\ndignity, the National Customs Service, managed by foreigners, takes its\r\nway somewhat apart on Koulan Street. With the British Legal, it is the\r\nbest civil service in the Far East, the other legations depending in\r\nvarious degrees upon missionaries for their knowledge of Chinese. The\r\nAmerican legation in recent years has equipped its staff with student\r\ninterpreters. Foreigners learn attachment for the life, as their wits\r\nare kept at work. It has been a wonderful capital in exciting life, as\r\nit is in physical appearance. Foreign press bureaus have vied with one\r\nanother in sending out men fitted to obtain privileged information. In\r\nsummer, the working Pekingese throws away all the clothes that the law\r\nwill allow; in winter, he puts on so many cotton-wadded coats that he\r\nlooks like a balloon ready to ascend, if he were not weighted with a\r\ncharcoal brazier tucked under his coat or up his sleeve. He has a stone\r\nor brick kang (stove), but he must lie close to it to get its meager\r\nwarmth. He, therefore, uses it for a bed, and so does the whole insect\r\nrace, who make it warm for him, even if the brick stove does not. When\r\nthe schoolboy wrote his ambiguous essay that “crowded China is too\r\nthickly populated to be comfortable”, he may, therefore, have referred\r\nto other inhabitants than the men and women. The furs of Peking are\r\nfamous, and many black chow-dog farms have been started in Mongolia to\r\nsupply the foreign fur markets. Peking has been so looted by war and\r\nby collectors of its ceramic prizes that the shops and potteries of Liu\r\nLi Street contain less that is valuable than the museums of America\r\nand Europe. For the ordinary traveler who wants something beautiful,\r\neven if it is not old, there are thousands of shops and bazaar tables\r\nthat display their tempting wares. As China reforms, and art is not\r\nsweated out of the provinces by grasping officials and courtiers, the\r\ntraveler will be able to follow his quest back to the many old centers\r\nof production in the central and southern provinces; and this will be\r\nbetter for art, and better for the traveler. The whole nation used to\r\ntremble when an official, dowager, baby emperor, prince, regent, etc.,\r\nhad a birthday or one of their various anniversaries, because it meant\r\nthat jade, jewels, costly furniture, tapestries, porcelain, etc., must\r\nprove the sincerity of congratulations, and as we fill the papier-mâché\r\nrabbit with candies on Easter Day the vase had to be filled with coins\r\nof worth. These presents were no sooner received than they were pawned\r\nby the indigent Manchus to the shopkeepers of Peking, or they were\r\nstolen and sold by the palace eunuchs. The Chinese system of keeping\r\nart in drawers instead of in glassed cabinets, in view, aided this\r\nthievery, for the rascally eunuchs were not soon found out.\r\n\r\nMany wonderful stories are told of the mysterious ceremonies of the\r\nManchu court at night; how soldiers suddenly lined Meridian Street,\r\nand no Chinese could leave his house but on pain of death. Then the\r\nWu Men gate of the Forbidden City was thrown open under the smoking\r\ntorches, and the pale Emperor Kwang Hsu was carried forth, robed in\r\nyellow, and his courtiers in red, gold and blue. Down Meridian Street\r\nthey noiselessly marched southward, the soldiers turning _volte-face_\r\nalong the street. The Chien Men gate into the Chinese city was thrown\r\nopen, and through its Meridian Street the procession continued south\r\nfor two miles to the temples and the open altar of Heaven, where\r\nmidnight sacrifices of a black bullock, burned silk, grain and wine\r\nwere made; a worship as old and as simple as that of the patriarchial\r\ndays of Abraham. It was the worship of the ancestral Chou clan, which\r\nConfucius chronicled and the Manchu adopted so as to keep himself\r\nin veneration; and this right of sacrifice he has maintained in his\r\nabdication. The Pope Mikado has also retained his right to make\r\nsimilar sacrifices. Surely if the main hold on eastern peoples is to\r\nbe a superstitious one, it is not so strong a hold as the republicans\r\nof China intend to set up in the minds and hearts of the new nation.\r\nGod’s name was simply called “Tien”; i. e., heaven or sky. Then the\r\nprocession hurried back long before the non-Manchus were awake. Other\r\nmysterious things happened in the night. The Wu Men gate was opened,\r\nand all courtiers and ministers then alone had their audience with the\r\nscreened crown head. During the long regency of the Dowager Empress\r\nTse Hsi and her predecessors, China was a land ruled by midnight\r\ndecisions, and justice was as dark as the muffled and mysterious hour.\r\nExecutions of the prominent were held at night on the common Meridian\r\nRoad, which had been blocked off by soldiers. You never know at Peking\r\nwhen your passenger cart is standing over the altar of a life which\r\nwas persecuted and sacrificed for opinion’s sake. No wonder that the\r\nChinese, like other long-suffering reformers, are saying under their\r\nbreath: “We have had enough of ‘plants’ and deeds done in darkness; let\r\nthere be light.”\r\n\r\nThis wonderful walled capital of Mongol, Ming and Manchu dynasties, is\r\nnot so old as the Great Wall of China, for it has been rebuilt several\r\ntimes, the imperial portion being about 1,000 years older than the\r\ninferior Chinese section to the south. It was as though the Chinese\r\ntraders camped before the southern Chien Men gate to supply the Manchu\r\ncourt, and the Emperor Kia Tsing rose up and said: “Let us now take\r\nthought, and throw a wide wall around our purveyors’ bazaars also.”\r\nThere is only one good thing about absolutism; i. e., to say is to do,\r\nand it was done. Peking has had many rivals as the capital of China:\r\nNanking, the southern capital of the Mings, in particular; Hangchow,\r\nof the Sungs; and Canton, Wuchang, Chingtu and Shanghai have all put\r\nin their claims and maintained their flag in the breeze for a regal\r\nseason. Geographically and strategically, Chingtu would be the proper\r\ncapital of a united nation, and Wuchang would be almost as central and\r\nafford better trading facilities, a London of China, but it would not\r\nbe so strong a strategic center. From a Chinese republican point of\r\nview, Canton, Nanking and Shanghai are foremost in their claims. Peking\r\nis weak because it is always within striking distance of Russia’s and\r\nJapan’s mighty armies. Almost alone of the world’s capitals, it is not\r\nat the water’s edge.\r\n\r\nThere are temples to nearly everything in Peking, a “Brooklyn of\r\nChurches”, but most of the altars this time are heathen: temples\r\nto Buddhas, sleeping in Nirvana, recumbent in Cingalese style; a\r\nsplendid Lama Temple with wonderful carvings in wood and stone; God\r\nof War; Confucian; Taoist; Catholic Cathedral; Evangelical of every\r\ndenomination of the three Protestant nations; Mohammedan mosques; God\r\nof Literature; God of Fox; Russian Greek Church; Portuguese Church;\r\nshrines over Buddha’s skin, teeth and a score of other things;\r\nAncestral temples; Altars of the Sun, Moon, and Gods of Grain and Rain;\r\ntemples to Buddha’s mother, and Gods of Success, and “World Peace”\r\n(not the recent invention of an armed peace!); Gods of Title Deeds,\r\nDragons, Wind and Water, the North Star; Gods of Dead Elephants and\r\nStrong Tigers, etc. When the jolly men of Canton and another southern\r\ncity heard of all this, glorious humorists that they are, they said\r\nthey could “go it one better”. They erected with a rush a “Temple to\r\nTen Thousand Gods”, all of whom look alike, even the images named for\r\nMarco Polo and “Chinese” Gordon. Chided with all this, a humorous\r\nCantonese retorted: “Well, haven’t you Occidentals an Eden Musée and\r\nMadame Tussaud’s wax works; don’t take our idols as seriously as you do\r\nthe Indian ones.” There are superbly carved marble dagobas in the Lama\r\nand Pi-Un-Se Temples. The Peking Lama is second in authority in the\r\nBuddhist world, and since General Chao Ehr Feng drove the Dalai Lama\r\nout of Tibet into India, the Peking Lama has now probably most power\r\nin the Buddhist world. The Pali Chuan pagoda outside the west wall is\r\nthe most ornate in China. Burmese Buddhists brought their art influence\r\nthus far north, and under patronage of the Ming emperors cast it up\r\nlike a pearl wrecked upon a barren shore; for the Manchu, who succeeded\r\nin the dynasty, is not an architect nor an artist. He has had to call\r\nin Chinese, Indian, Persian, Mohammedan and Jesuit architects from time\r\nto time to adorn his capitals and his graveyards at Mukden and Peking.\r\nThere are towering, priceless bronze censers; stone and metal tablets;\r\ndelightful octagonal marble mausoleums with circular second stories,\r\ntopped with conic fluted roof, which is copied from the perfect act\r\nof the incomparable blue Temple of Heaven, and like the second story\r\nof the divinely beautiful choragic monument of Lysicrates at Athens.\r\nIn his book, _The Chinese_, the author has referred to many other\r\nsimilarities between Greek and Chinese art and architecture, which are\r\nas wonderful as the dissimilarities. The ponderous gate forts, Manchu\r\nDrum and Ming Bell towers, with the largest bells in the world, sixteen\r\nfeet high and nine inches thick, and the delightful compound or palace\r\ngates, are notable. The Buddhists have bell and statue foundries in\r\nthe Tartar city, and there are potteries for dainty cloisonné. There\r\nare said to be some lost Jewish Chinese at Peking, as at Kaifong. They\r\nare now butchers, and worship with the Mohammedans, having lost nearly\r\nall their religious, if not their phrenological distinction long ago.\r\nWhat proof is stronger that the phylacteries of any conviction should\r\nbe worn day and night on the forehead, as well as engraven on the\r\nheart, “lest we forget”. The trees and lakes of the city and suburbs\r\nare conspicuous, because all Chinese buildings, except pagodas, are not\r\nover two stories in height, and do not dwarf the lovely landscape.\r\n\r\nThere is one dead foreign city in China, Cathay’s “Deserted Village”,\r\nimmortal Port Arthur. Where are now the streets of palatial Renaissance\r\npalaces which eight years ago nestled under Golden Hill and lined\r\nthe bund of the Eastern Port? Where are the massed battalions of\r\nAlexeieff’s troops, white-capped, white-tunicated and high-booted,\r\nwhich used to dress ranks on the broad parade ground behind Golden\r\nHill? What stilled forever the music of the ringing glasses, drained of\r\ntheir sweet Roederer by gold-braided arms that lifted them quickly to\r\nharsh lips in Saratoff’s gay restaurant on the sunny bund? What hushed\r\nthe song of the musée and Odessa ballet girls on the small stage in\r\nsmoky Nicobadza’s Café in the New Town? Over the breakers that lash\r\nthe Tiger’s Tail Peninsula do the ghosts of Admiral Makharov, the\r\ncourt painter, Verestchagin, and seven hundred and fifty others of the\r\nmine-sunk _Petropavlovsk_ battleship still whisper their mournful\r\nnames like a dirge of St. Andrew, as on that sad gray morning of\r\nApril 4, 1904? Where are the battleships _Sevastopol_, _Peresviet_,\r\n_Poltava_ and _Nicolai_, which used to lie safely under Golden Hill,\r\nwhile terrific war harmlessly hurled fire and shell from Kikwan Hill,\r\nPigeon Bay, where we used to shoot snipe, and Wolf’s Hill? Surely they\r\nare not the salvaged and transformed _Sagami_, _Tango_, _Iki_, etc.,\r\nflying now the rayed, red sun instead of the white, blue and red flag\r\nof St. Andrew. On second view, they certainly are; there are the high\r\nfreeboard of a Baltic-built vessel of the Kronstadt navy-yard.\r\n\r\nWe search in vain for the newspaper office of Alexeieff’s official\r\norgan, the _Novo Krai_, and we miss from the gay bund the dashing team\r\nof the richest Chinese compradore army-purveyor, Chih Fun Tai, Esquire.\r\nThe naval dockyard across the harbor from Golden Hill is, however,\r\ndeveloped better than ever, though you can not get near it because of\r\nthe watchful Japanese picket, unless you wish to be incarcerated under\r\nthe international spy act! The fine white hospital buildings to the\r\nwest of the inner harbor are also improved. The wrecking crews are\r\nstill working with derricks and drags at the narrow harbor entrance\r\nonly two hundred yards wide upon the rock-filled hulls which Captain\r\nHirose, the Hobson of Japan, sank there at the cost of his life, under\r\nthe fire of Golden Hill on a hazy morning in April, 1904, so as to\r\ncork up the navy of Russia and allow Togo to scour the seas with his\r\nBritish naval preceptor at his side on the bridge, instead of being\r\nheld in blockading leash. Around the harbor tower the great forts of\r\nstrategically essential 203 Metre Hill, stubborn North Hill, Kikwan\r\nHill, Ehr Lung (Two Dragons) Hill, Sun Shu Hill, “H” fort, Palung\r\nHill, and Wan Tai. Not a large tree waves on them, though some stubby\r\nfirs for masking purposes are being set out stealthily. Everywhere is\r\ndesolation; choked tunnels and saps underground, filled war galleries\r\nabove ground, broken gun carriages, burst Krupp and Armstrong guns\r\npiled up in titanic wreckage. Heroic Kondrachenko and gallant Stoessel\r\non one side, and Grant-like Nogi on the other, sowed the hundred\r\nvalleys and hillsides hereabout with rusting bayonets, belt buckles,\r\nmedals of glory and skulls of death. Thousands and thousands of men,\r\nknown not by their names but by their number tag, like prisoners,\r\ndropped before the ruthless and fame-obliterating fire of range-fixed\r\nguns operating behind searchlights. It was the steady mowing of the\r\ngrim reaper himself, until Nogi determined to reach Kondrachenko, and\r\nNorth and 203 Metre forts, underground instead of by bombardment and\r\nassault. Nickel-nosed bullets, soft-nosed spreaders, broken sabers,\r\nrusted buttons, bleaching bones, water cans, leather knapsack bottles,\r\nslowly rotting walnut rifle stocks, four-inch and eight-inch shells,\r\ncamp-fire equipments, pots, match-boxes, frames that held sweetheart’s\r\npicture next the heart, star orders of the heathen emperor and cross\r\ndecorations of the Holy Tsar of Peace (!), numbers that were tagged\r\non the neck to take the place of the name of a man, breeches of\r\nquick-firing guns, barrels of Gatlings and Nordenfeldts, cartridge\r\ncases, porcelain saki bottles, metal clasps of Y. M. C. A. Bibles, all\r\nfill up these powder-upheaved furrows of Death, where not a Chinese\r\nbuilding stands of the once beautiful Chinese suburbs.\r\n\r\nOut of the historical hills and valleys wind the long parallel ribbons\r\nof the railway around the horseshoe bend of the Kwang Tung Peninsula,\r\nbut no commercial traffic is now brought lower down than Dalny. A\r\ndestroyed city indeed, a precious ice-free port of commerce and a\r\nsunny bund of society, deserted by force of arms, a secret base and a\r\nmasked fort yet being silently strengthened. The fleet that holds the\r\nPacific holds Port Arthur at its will, and the hand that holds Port\r\nArthur can hold all China north of the Yangtze and up to the Amur River\r\nin its iron grasp, if there is a will and an exchequer to launch the\r\nforce. Russia allowed commerce, travel and society to come with war to\r\nPort Arthur. Japan only allows war to mark time here. True, the Yamato\r\nHotel is there yet, but it is exclusively for the garrison artillery\r\nlife of the little brown men who by edict of government have given up\r\nsitting on mats that their legs may grow as tall as their minds and\r\nambitions, despite Matthew 6:27. Whether there are Anglo-Japanese,\r\nAnglo-American, Sino-American, American-Japanese, Russo-Germanic,\r\nAnglo-French, or Four-Nation alliances or entente cordiales, this\r\nquestion will always come up: “Well, what about the deserted,\r\nshell-swept city of the Far East, the masked and granite fort, Port\r\nArthur?”\r\n\r\nWhat happened to Port Arthur can happen to any city of China north of\r\nHongkong, unless China is put on her feet and has an army of defense.\r\nUnder whose tutelage shall that force arise? Not a true man lives who\r\nwants to see another Dead City of the East. There this one stands,\r\nterrible to-day as eight years ago, the most terrific, oppressively\r\nsilent, shell-blown, mine-scarred, tunnel-cut, war-cursed, sap-seared,\r\nskeleton-grinning, warped, agonized, Luciferian monument of bloody war\r\nthat the world exhibits. Tuck it away in the toe of the Tiger’s Tail\r\nin far-away China, and let busy altruistic mankind, yellow and white,\r\nforget it. Forget it! Yes! but I hear the hammering and riveting, the\r\ncranking of the siege guns, the piling of the ammunition, the digging\r\nand blasting of the deep docks still going on. In the midst of peace\r\nand life we are yet in the midst of war and death. Yet the Dead City\r\nof the Far East, in dying, won something for progress; it checked the\r\nRussianization of China and the obliteration of China’s best son,\r\nJapan; it prevented the clash of Britain and Russia, and the eventual\r\nclash of America and Russia perhaps in the Philippines and Manchuria.\r\nIt loosened a little the ruthless hand of the Russian oligarchy upon\r\nthe neck of Dumas, and the Ochrana detectivization of the people.\r\nIn dying, it brought some dangers, too, that a not sufficiently\r\nrepresentative Japan would take the place of Russia in greed, and\r\nbring altruistic America upon her fleet; for the American people,\r\nloving freedom for all, and now writing text-books on that subject,\r\nare committed by John Hay’s “non-partition of China” policy to seeing\r\nthat Japan stops her imperialistic expansion with the absorption of\r\nKorea, and that China, the Mother of the East, is left to pursue her\r\nnew glorious destiny in peace, with no more of her sacred territory\r\nimperiled, until she can put liberty in free stride from the hot\r\nTonquin border to the Amur’s ice-fringed rapids.\r\n\r\nNewchwang, which means “ox depot”, is on the Liao River fifteen miles\r\nfrom the sea, Jinkow being its port. The bar permits of eighteen-foot\r\ndraught, but could be dredged deeper. The river is icebound from\r\nNovember till April. The exports are beans, bean cake, bean oil, gold,\r\nsilver, silk, black oxen, mutton, wool, wheat, kaoliang, little millet,\r\npulse, spirits, tobacco, paper, lumber, furs. Coal and iron would be\r\na heavy export if there was not railway discrimination on the part of\r\nthe Japanese. The imports are flour, machinery, cotton, etc. There is\r\nan important foreign settlement, and foreign hongs should move their\r\nadvance posts here for the attack on Manchurian trade. The city was\r\ninvested by the Russians in 1898 and 1900, and the Japanese to-day are\r\nalmost as active, having linked the city by railway with their Dalny\r\nline. They have established a Japanese settlement on the water-front,\r\nwith hotels, hospitals, tea-houses, banks, etc. The Chinese national\r\nrailways give a direct service north and south via Kinchow. Newchwang’s\r\ncommerce is fed by the immense fleet of 20,000 junks of the Liao River,\r\nwhich gather cargo even north of Mukden. Perhaps the most celebrated\r\nBritish consul and diplomatist who has been stationed here is the\r\nauthor, A. H. Hosie. In the Japan-China War of 1894 a great battle was\r\nfought at Newchwang.\r\n\r\nMukden, the home city of the Manchu race, lies one hundred miles\r\nnortheast of Newchang on the Shin River, a branch of the Liao River.\r\nIt has connection with the Japanese and Chinese railway systems,\r\nand northward it connects with the Russian system. The stone and\r\nbrick-walled inner city is one mile across; the outer wall, with\r\neight double gates, is fourteen miles around, and there are important\r\nsuburbs. It is a smaller Peking in plan. East of Mukden there are\r\nwalled tombs of the Manchu emperors, and of Shun Chih and Narachu,\r\nthe founders of the dynasty, which tombs suffered in the Russo-Japan\r\nWar. A plain mound, with a growing tree upon it, covers the founder’s\r\ntomb. Winged griffins guard the southern gateway, which is so stern\r\nin architecture as hardly to suggest the Orient. There are the usual\r\npailoo memorial arches, rising on the backs of tortoises, and two\r\nunique pillars with lions on top, which design is copied from the Ming\r\nemperors, whose throne the Manchus ravaged. The north gate oddly is\r\nsingle, and not triple in Chinese style, and is guarded by a plain,\r\ntwo-roofed pagoda. The court is stone laid. The main avenue of the tomb\r\nis guarded by monster statues of lions, camels, horses, elephants and\r\nwarriors. The ancestral temple contains a tortoise which bears the\r\ntablets. Mourning houses, temples, stone screens and vases add to the\r\nensemble.\r\n\r\nThe old Chung Cheng yellow-tiled palace is at the south gate of the\r\ncity, and has been tenanted by notable and progressive viceroys, one\r\nof whom attempted to reconcile the Eastern and Western religions. The\r\nimperial palace, Wen So Ko, has the imperial library of 7,000 cases.\r\nIts rich museum of priceless bronzes, vases, tapestries, etc., was\r\nlargely looted by the Manchu princes, who sold the treasures to the\r\ncurio collectors who flocked like vultures to Peking in the financial\r\ntroubles of the revolution. The Fei Lung Ko treasury is on the east\r\nside and the Hsiang Feng Ko treasury is on the west side. There is a\r\nmodern Chinese commercial museum; the Yamato Hotel in the extensive\r\nJapanese section; a Japanese railway medical college; an Astor Hotel;\r\na Chinese medical college; and the medical college of the Scotch\r\nPresbyterians outside the east gate, with which the noted author,\r\nDoctor J. Ross, is connected. Doctor Christie, of Mukden, was another\r\nhero of the terrific pneumonic plague in Manchuria in 1910–11. The\r\nusual favorite Fox Temple of the Manchu race is to be seen. There is\r\na Taoist Temple of Hell, with horrible statues. The Temple to the God\r\nof Literature is the most beautiful in bare Manchuria, because of the\r\nartistic proportion of its walls, galleries, roofs and stairs; but\r\nthe temple has little independent meaning, because the Manchus have\r\nabsolutely no original literature, possessing in their perpendicular\r\nSyriac-like script only copies of Chinese literature.\r\n\r\nNot only the Japanese are conspicuously in evidence; Russian droshkes\r\nare pulled at the gallop and trot along the Meridian Street of the\r\nDrum Tower. The unique tall shop signs are carved on pole and capital\r\nnot unlike Alaskan totem poles. Differently from the cities of South\r\nChina, many ponies and mules are seen on the street, and man is not\r\nhere, as in Middle and South China, the beast of burden. The best\r\nfrozen game, pork and mutton, and fish shops of China are in Mukden.\r\nOutside each angle of the walls is a Lama monument. Mukden is famous\r\nfor its black pigs, many of which, frozen, are shipped to Liverpool and\r\nLondon markets. The Japanese have erected fine railway, administration,\r\nbank, school, etc., buildings in their settlement. The city has\r\ntelephone, telegraph, electric light, mail and water service. Wen\r\nHsiang, the most enlightened Manchu prince connected with international\r\ndealings with China at Peking in the Victorian age, was a Mukden man,\r\nand is buried near the east gate. The foreign settlement has the usual\r\nclubs and churches, a brewery, and a large modern concrete factory\r\nof the British-American Tobacco Company, for when opium went out the\r\ncigarette came in, in disgusted Cathay! The Chinese hotel is the Hai\r\nTien Chun, near the entrance to the west gate. There are horse-tram\r\nrailways, electric trams, a Chinese provincial mint, and great fur,\r\nskin and coal markets. Mukden will yet be a leading center for land,\r\nmine, agricultural, machinery, food and clothing interchange of the\r\nworld, for rich, black-earth Manchuria is destined to be the granary of\r\nmore soil-impoverished countries of the Pacific than China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nNATIVE CITIES OF CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nSingan or Sian (meaning “Chinese”), the capital of Shensi province,\r\ndates back to the twelfth century, B.C. The whole valley is full of\r\nthe monuments, mounds and relics of kings of many ancient dynasties.\r\nAs its name appropriately shows, Singan was the original capital of\r\nChina, when the tribes first united in mutual recognition of kinship,\r\nand it is a shrine, therefore, appealing to antiquarians. Out on the\r\nplain the Emperor Tsin, builder of the Great Wall, “burned the books”\r\nof China, and buried the scholars under mounds of contumely. The most\r\nremarkable pyramidal pagoda in China lies beyond the south wall. It\r\nhas seven stories, surmounted with a turban, and temple buildings with\r\nrich screens are attached. To this city the Empress Dowager Tse Hsi\r\nretreated from Peking in a springless cart over sunken loess roads\r\nbefore the march of the European allies and the American column in\r\n1900. Its walls and large forts, filled with ports, are the oldest and\r\nbest preserved of all Chinese cities.\r\n\r\nThe Bankers’ Guild building is famous for its many-pinnacled roof and\r\nornate tiling. Its monuments relate the intellectual communion of China\r\nand India in the seventh century A. D. Very old buildings exhibit a\r\nfour-leaf clover design in stone screens, and the fish-scale design\r\nin wooden and bamboo balustrades. There are wonderful gardens with\r\npavilions and wavy stone bridges. Pailoos, bearing legends, are built\r\nover the entrance stairs to temples and guild houses. The square space\r\nwithin the walls is six miles long each way. One reason for its strong\r\nfortification is that it is in the Mohammedan section of China, and the\r\nMohammedans are always rebelling. It withstood a Mohammedan siege of\r\ntwo years in 1870–1.\r\n\r\nIf Russia aimed to cut off eastern from western China, she would strike\r\nat Singan, as it is the strategic base which holds Turkestan, Tibet and\r\nSzechuen to the empire. Its trade is vast and various. From a religious\r\nand antiquarian point of view, hardly any Chinese city equals it in the\r\ninterest of Occidentals, for here the famous Nestorian Tablet, dated\r\n781 A.D., stands in the park of a heathen temple. This tablet records\r\nthe communion of the earliest Chinese Christians. A copy of this\r\nsupremely venerable and artistic stone was placed in the Metropolitan\r\nMuseum of Art, New York, in 1909. The National Library, Paris, has\r\nhad a replica since 1850. The Pei Lin Park contains a library cut in\r\n1,300 stone tablets; the “Stone Forest”, it is called. The city lies\r\nin a plain, and presents a striking appearance from the limestone\r\nand loess hills which surround it. In these hills, to the northwest,\r\nare cut the cave dwellings, temples and statues of prehistoric and\r\nearly civilizations. In one cave temple is the sandstone and gilt\r\ncolossal Ta-Fu-Tsze Buddha, fifty-six feet high, the largest statue\r\nin China, showing the tremendous zeal of the Buddhist movement in the\r\nbrilliant Tang dynasty in the seventh century, when our Europe was in\r\nintellectual darkness. Two colossal statues of Buddha’s pupils are also\r\nin this temple.\r\n\r\nThe city presents a brilliant kaleidoscope of nationalities:\r\nMohammedans with red turbans, Tartars wearing red panels; Mongols with\r\nblue turbans; high-booted, bewhiskered Russians; booted Tibetans;\r\nblue-gowned Chinese; yellow-robed Lamas; now and then a top-knotted\r\naborigine; robed Manchus; and descendants of the original Tsin and\r\nChou tribes of Chinese who came east to China from the cradle of\r\nthe race, seated in the saddle of pioneer conquerors; and with the\r\nHebrews, these Singan men can probably boast that they bring down the\r\npurest blood from the dispersion of Ararat. Descendants of kings and\r\ngenerals of many a dynasty now plough farms on the plain, and they\r\nwill tell you: “Yes, I am the son of a king.” Near here the builder of\r\nthe Great Wall, infinitely the greatest mason and military commander\r\nof history, the Emperor Tsin, 220 B. C., had his capital at Hsien\r\nYang. His huge pyramidal mound, and other burial mounds, are among the\r\nworld’s greatest curiosities. On the plain are the two unique marble\r\narches, with four roofs, erected by Governor Lu to the memory of his\r\nmother and wife, in the China where some writers say women meet with no\r\nhonor. A stone bridge of seventy arches over the Pa River, and the hot\r\nsulphur springs of Lin Tung, are notable. The round, instead of square\r\nstone piers, are unique in China, and show Moslem influence. Not all\r\nChinese cities were without attention from the sanitary engineer. Old\r\nculverts and drains constructed by the ancient kings of the north exist\r\nin Singan and elsewhere, and some of the southern cities have drainage\r\ncanals, sewage canals not being considered necessary, as the night-soil\r\nis collected for fertilization. China, however, is going to drain her\r\ncities so as to carry off expectoration and decaying matter. The smells\r\nwhich the tourist revolts at are not as dangerous as they seem, as\r\nopium, peculiar incense, and vegetable cooking oils, such as sesamum,\r\npeanut, bean, etc., contribute the most malodorous portion.\r\n\r\nChingtu stands in a wide plain in the heart of the vast empire. The\r\nwalls are fifteen miles around, and the gates of these walls are\r\nnever opened at night, except to the “chi” (government messengers).\r\nEither Chingtu or the Hankau cities will be the capital of the nation\r\neventually. It is an intellectual center, and there are many publishing\r\nshops. Two rivers, the Min and To, border the plain, and are broken up\r\ninto the widest system of irrigation canals that the world shows. No\r\ngarden of the earth is so rich as this warm moist Eden. Every tree,\r\nherb and plant of the tropics and sub-tropics is raised, and more men\r\nare supported here to the acre than anywhere else in the world. It\r\nis the earth’s model school of intensive farming, and would delight\r\nthe professors of the specializing University of Wisconsin! In the\r\nsandstone and loess hills are the cliff dwellings of prehistoric man.\r\nThere are hundreds of bridges and ferries, many temples, arches,\r\ncemeteries and villages, the latter often populated by one family clan.\r\nThe great walled city of a million inhabitants has the widest streets\r\nof any native city except Peking. There is a Tartar walled city within\r\nthe Chinese city. The forts over the gates are of three stories. The\r\nloyal General Chao Ehr Feng, the hero of the Tibet campaign in 1910,\r\nheld Chingtu for many months against the republicans in the fall of\r\n1911.\r\n\r\nThe Provincial Assembly proclaimed reform in September, 1911, from\r\na wonderful, circular, double-roofed temple in Chingtu. There is a\r\nlarge Mohammedan population, and mosques are therefore conspicuous.\r\nMarco Polo was a traveler here. There are wide Tartar parade grounds\r\nand rifle butts. The markets and fairs held in the temple grounds\r\n(religion and business being partners in China as in that Boston church\r\nthat uses its basement for stores!) are the best in the empire. It is\r\nthe splendid capital of the largest and richest province; a center\r\nof independent provincials who are crying “China for the Chinese.”\r\nIt has a modern union university, which teaches English, science and\r\nChinese; trade, military and girls’ schools; musk, silk, brass, salt,\r\nhorn-lantern, oil, fur, spice, lace, porcelain, cotton and wool shops;\r\na few iron shops; decorated yamen and guild halls. Its traveling\r\nkitchens, its porters and wheelbarrow brotherhoods are unique. One\r\ntemple, erected to the Sheep-god in particular, is remarkable for two\r\nreasons: first, that it is a Taoist and not a Buddhist monastery: and\r\nsecond, that it is one of the finest examples of architecture in the\r\nempire. It is the beautiful Ching Yang Kung (Temple of the Golden\r\nSheep) monastery outside the south gate. The Chu Ko Liang monastery,\r\nwith its circular doors, is another chef-d’œuvre.\r\n\r\nMany nations and faiths have missions here, and their medical schools\r\nand hospitals have won the hearts of the Chinese even ahead of their\r\nexcellent schools. Chingtu is one of the centers that the Canadian\r\nmissions have selected for special work. One meets many foreign\r\nengineers, and there are also native engineers. The climate is far more\r\nendurable for foreigners than that of South China at the seacoast.\r\nMany Lolo and Miaotse aborigine mountaineers, with their hair worn\r\nin a top-knot, are seen on the busy streets. Rice and wheat mills\r\nare being erected, and furniture, florist, book, bronze and picture\r\nstores abound. Chingtu will be the center of the commercial attack on\r\nrich Southeast Tibet, as the main pass of Ta Chien is not far away.\r\nBritain plans to link Chingtu to her Burmese and Indian railways by\r\nloaning the Chinese the necessary money. The Chingtu gentry started a\r\nrailway to Ichang on the Yangtze River, and differences with the Peking\r\nauthorities over the nationalization of this railway in September\r\nprecipitated the October, 1911, rebellion at the Hankau cities. There\r\nis an arsenal, a mint, a military school and police barracks, the\r\npolice being uniformed in modern style, with the addition of arms.\r\nThe French are also in evidence at Chingtu, as they would like to run\r\ntheir railway up from Yunnan City. Railways are planned to run north to\r\nSingan, east to Ichang through exceedingly difficult country, south to\r\nChungking, and west to Batang and Burma. Politically the Chingtu people\r\nare progressive and fearless like the men of Hupeh province, whence\r\nthey came, as in 1644 Chang Hsien Chang depopulated Chingtu.\r\n\r\nChungking, the second city of vast Szechuen province, is a riverine\r\nport with a great future as a railway, boat, trading and manufacturing\r\ncenter; a future Pittsburgh, perhaps. It is built on a rocky peninsula\r\njust like Macao, the Yangtze and Kialing Rivers forming two sides,\r\nand a wall the third side of a triangle. From the hills outside the\r\nwall, the graves of the ages look down on the busy scene, as the\r\ncarriers set out on the long stone road toward the capital, Chingtu.\r\nChungking is famous for its water-gates, overhanging buildings propped\r\nover the rock with long poles. Some of its streets are exceptionally\r\nclean, wide and well paved. It is called the “piled-up” city, like the\r\nlower part of rocky Hongkong, the roof of one row of buildings being\r\npart of the street of the tier of buildings above. There is a great\r\nparade ground, and a military school by the land wall. The city is a\r\ncenter for fitting up expeditions which are bound for the prosperous\r\ncapital in the north, the rich hilly south, or the wild west. Drugs,\r\nvegetable and mineral oils, water-proof paper, salt, coal, furs, iron,\r\ntea, lanterns, cement, agricultural products including sugar, bamboo,\r\nsilk in particular, boat builders’ and chandlers’ supplies, placer\r\nand quartz gold, are all specialties of the district. Fine pagodas,\r\nwith beautiful, up-curling galleries, overlook the river, and there\r\nare excellent “Li Pais” or mission compounds, and modern educational\r\ninstitutions. There are fine guilds, as one could expect of the Hupeh\r\nand Hunan province merchants, and the Ho Gai Monastery reveals a\r\ndelightful touch of the old times. Beautiful pailoo arches span the\r\nroads. The Guild of Benevolence is famous for its extremely beautiful\r\npavilions and terraces. As at all the riverine ports of the Yangtze,\r\nthe great flights of wet stone stairs are characteristic. Chungking was\r\nonce the second worst opium hell in the kingdom, but the people awoke\r\nto their danger in a wonderfully surprising way, and in the years from\r\n1908–11 largely threw off the curse.\r\n\r\nIn Chungking the rebels of 1911 recruited many of their first\r\npatriots, and the first attacks were planned from here. The people\r\nare an earnest-looking set, yet the place for centuries, like its\r\ngreat winter mists which float down from Tibet, was the center of\r\nsorcery, superstition, fortune-telling and folk-lore. It was just the\r\nplace to raise soothsayers, poets and astrologers. The only man who\r\nhad a stronger wand like Aaron’s which swallowed up all the rest,\r\nwas the American or British medical missionary, who by 1910 grew to\r\nbe heartily beloved, so much so that every foreigner was welcomed by\r\nrich and poor, and implored to “come in here, see my art treasures,\r\nand (incidentally!) before you go won’t you please heal my child, my\r\nbeloved and my old parent?” It was enough to make every traveler swear\r\nthat if he returned home safely he would at once study medicine and\r\ncome back to China as a physician of the body first, and the soul and\r\neconomic state afterward. The boat people of the port are famous for\r\ntheir courage and skill, and the mountain coolies are noted for their\r\nendurance. Much of the blood of the race is from Hupeh, which means a\r\nstrong strain of “China for the Chinese”. The city is surrounded with\r\nhills and ranges, and there are many mountain health resorts used by\r\nnatives and foreigners, which are exceedingly welcome in the moist hot\r\nsummer. There is the Golden Buddha range to the south, with its fine\r\ntemples and many aborigine dwellers. Ho Ih Shan Mountain is to the\r\nnorth. The Gong Gorge is a scenic spot of great beauty. The British\r\nhave a palatial consulate at Chungking, with a bungalow adjunct in\r\nthe hills so as to afford escape from the terrific summer. This is\r\nthe policy that the Hongkong Bank long ago instituted in China; mess\r\nquarters over the bank for winter occupancy, and airy bungalow quarters\r\non Hongkong peak for summer occupancy. There are many Mohammedans in\r\nChungking, and four of the industries which they control are bakeries,\r\nbutcher shops, inns and common carrying.\r\n\r\nWuhu, on the Yangtze, half-way up to Hankau, is recovering from the\r\nblow dealt it by the Taipings in the 60’s. It will take a prominent\r\nplace in the coming industrial China because of riches in land, mine,\r\nsilk, tea and bamboo near it. It is one of the new strongholds in\r\neducation and medicine under American and European auspices. It has\r\na foreign colony in the hills. The Hwangchi River brings grain and\r\nproduce down to its marts, and the great Yangtze sweeps by its harbor\r\nbund. Game, such as pheasant, quail and duck, abounds. There are very\r\nfine pagodas, and in particular a Buddhist rock temple with the figures\r\nof men, animals and birds cut solidly out of, or in relief on the solid\r\nrock, the shrubbery and grass serving for hair and beard in a startling\r\nway. Excursions can be made to the Chin Shan and San Shan hills,\r\ntemples, lily lakes and flowery restaurants. The town is full of the\r\nfestival spirit, and the beauty of lanterns, arches, flags and matting\r\nshelter is often delightfully exhibited. Wuhu early went over to the\r\nrebel movement of October, 1911. Wuhu is a great sufferer from floods.\r\nThey were so deep in August, 1911, that Lion Hill became an island. The\r\nYangtze, instead of mounting willingly up to Nanking, tries at Wuhu to\r\nbreak across country for Shanghai. The result is deplorable flood and\r\nresultant famine, involving millions of people.\r\n\r\nTai Yuen is the walled capital of the great coal, iron and loess\r\nprovince of Shansi, which is as large as England. It is the richest\r\nin minerals of all the provinces. The famous Ping Ting coal and iron\r\nmines are near. The city lies in a great plain 3,000 feet above the\r\nsea on the Fen River, and has railway connection with Peking and all\r\nthe east and south. It is to have connection with the capital of Kansu\r\nprovince, and all the great northwest for thousands of miles. Mills\r\nwill arise, for stone, clay, iron and coal are available in this\r\nprovince as nowhere else. Though the air of the city is exhilarating\r\nand there is little consumption, skin diseases and diseases due to poor\r\nwater are prevalent. With irrigation in operation, fertilization of\r\nthis loess province would be unnecessary, so that Tai Yuen will yet be\r\na great wheat and millet center. Her grain, stock and wool merchants\r\nwill be taking contracts to feed and clothe America and Britain when\r\nour fields are impoverished and overrun with people. It will be a\r\nfinancial center, for Shansi’s wealth in China’s new industrial era can\r\nnot be computed. Even now the Shansi bankers are the best known, their\r\nguild houses being in every city of the land. The railway, electric\r\nlight, post, telegraph and telephone have arrived, and so has the\r\nprinting press, raying out reform. The railway has brought progress\r\nto quaint Tai Yuen. There are match factories, police department, a\r\npublic band, modern schools of all sorts, an agricultural and military\r\nschool, modern roads and a street-cleaning department, a modern jail\r\nwhich aims to teach instead of confirming in despair. Confucius fled\r\nhere to the Wei State, when his own state persecuted him, and this\r\nprovince is the home of the original clan of Chinese, the Chou, who\r\ninstituted ancestor worship and the rule of princes at the beginning\r\nof history. The great Shansi University was established here in 1901\r\nby the British with indemnity funds restored to the Chinese at the\r\nrequest of British missions, which was a singularly Samaritan act; for\r\non July 9, 1900, at the yamen in Tai Yuen, all the missionaries, their\r\nwives and children, were put to a brutal death by the infamous “Boxer,”\r\nthe Luciferian brute, Governor Yu Hsien, whose name is hated by the\r\nprogressive Chinese as much as we hate it, and the Manchu officials\r\nwho took their “tip” from the dowager empress, Tse Hsi. Doctor Timothy\r\nRichard, promoter of the successful Red Cross in China, was the first\r\npresident of this institution, and W. E. Soothill was its second\r\npresident. Both these gentlemen lead in Britain’s educational influence\r\nin China. English, of course, is taught. Like all the northern cities,\r\nTai Yuen is cursed in fall with the penetrating loess and sand-storms.\r\nThe blue-roofed and blue-walled Temple of Heaven is beautiful, with its\r\nmagnificent eaves, carved terminals, colored frieze, columns, statues,\r\nscrolls, paintings and theater. There are also Confucian, Manchu-Fox,\r\nBuddhist and Taoist temples and pagodas, and a Mohammedan mosque, for\r\nthis is the first city, going west, where we meet this last sect,\r\nwhose sphere extends right on to the far northwest. There is a notable\r\nfour-storied fort over the Romanesque south gate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright, 1913, The Bobbs-Merrill Company.\r\n\r\n  Treeless mountains of South China, Kwangtung province.

Woolen\r\n    clothing is taking the place of the padded cotton garments shown,\r\n    and leather shoes are rapidly coming into use.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Manchus have their own Tartar or military city, which will now\r\nbecome the administrative headquarters. Many furs are brought\r\ndown from the Mohammedan and Mongolian plains in the west and north.\r\nThere are mission schools and hospitals, a military parade ground,\r\nand an arsenal. The twin pagodas of thirteen stories, with narrow\r\ngalleries, are famous. The pailoo memorial arches are distinct from\r\nthe open southern type, the Shansi type being a solid top-heavy tower.\r\nMore ponies are to be seen here than in most of the cities, and the\r\nhorsemanship of the Mongols is daring, as we should expect from the\r\ndescendants of Kublai Khan’s hordes, whom Marco Polo praised in that\r\nfamous memorial that was dictated in a prison of Europe more terrible\r\nto him than all the dangers of Far Cathay.\r\n\r\nYunnan, the capital of the great copper and tin province, is five\r\nhundred miles from the Gulf of Tonquin, with which a French narrow\r\ngage railway, completed at awful cost of men and money, now connects\r\nit. The city is in a plain five thousand feet high, at the foot of the\r\nTibetan Mountains. A great lake, the Tanklu, near by, is connected by\r\ncanal with the city. It is the center of a warmer art than the other\r\nprovinces, the architecture showing the elaborate Burmese influence,\r\nwhich relies on ornament and color more than line and proportion.\r\nSome of the pagodas are square, peculiar to Yunnan, and have nine to\r\nthirteen stories, and galleries, as compared with seven to nine stories\r\nelsewhere. The gate forts are ornate, though the roofs do not curl\r\nup as fantastically and richly as in the east of China. The British\r\nand French are fighting it out for chief foreign influence, with the\r\nlatter ahead as yet, because the railway from Mandalay has not been\r\nrun through. There are fine French stores where you can purchase\r\nmadame’s millinery, confection or perfumery, a French hospital and a\r\npalatial French consulate; but the Chinese have far greater trust in\r\nthe Americans and British, for French designs on Chinese territory\r\nare feared. Yunnan does not want to follow Tonquin. There are many\r\nMohammedans, and their round mosque towers are in evidence.\r\n\r\nGreat rebellions and massacres have occurred, as in those bloody years\r\n1857–73 when General Tsen made a name for ruthlessness which still\r\nstrikes terror throughout China. The city, with a splendid division of\r\nthe modern army, went over to the rebels on November 3, 1911. Outside\r\nthe walls are two interesting temples. The Golden Heaven Temple is in\r\nthe northeastern hills. Part of it is made of gilt copper, and shows\r\nBurmese influence. The stairs, terraces, openwork balustrades, tiling,\r\nroofs and scrolls are very fine. The Buddhist temple cut in the rock\r\nover the lake is a noble work, even extra niches being cut for the\r\nstatues. It is not likely that this costly work will ever again be done\r\nin China, for “the god has lost his grip,” the devotee having found\r\nout that he was hollow! The bald monks are scratching their heads and\r\nthinking what new thing they can devise to bolster up the system. Many\r\nof them have gone in the hotel and teaching business! The flags of\r\nthe temples have bells attached to them, and bells are hung under the\r\neaves. Every breeze in Yunnan is laden with silver and gold, therefore.\r\nThere are temples and shrines to the goddess Kwan Yun, who is said to\r\ngive good luck to travelers. It is proper ritual to roll the prayer\r\npaper on your tongue, and in a ball shoot it toward the statue, where,\r\nif it sticks, it means fortune for you, as the goddess will certainly\r\nbe unable to forget you. There are beautiful pavilions at the lake, and\r\nYunnan can now be considered a health resort for Southern and French\r\nChina. It is a center of engineering, and the headquarters of the\r\ninventors of the stone-and-chain suspension bridges which are peculiar\r\nto this province of gorges. The piers and pier houses are very\r\nartistic, and stand unique in the world’s architecture.\r\n\r\nYunnan has modern schools, colleges, hotels, hospitals; a mint,\r\npost-office and telegraph station; splendid modern barracks, a fine\r\nparade ground, etc. The university is a modern domed brick building\r\non a hill in the center of the city. Its dormitories are lighted by\r\nelectricity and the equipment is wonderful compared to what used to\r\nbe. There is a museum, and English, Japanese, French, science, music,\r\nagriculture and sericulture are among the branches taught. The best\r\ntrade school, however, is the modern jail, which is very popular! When\r\nyou hire a mechanic in Yunnan you are reasonably sure that you have a\r\nformer jailbird, just as in Peking, if you have a good clerk you are\r\nsure he is a Manchu prince incognito, for pensions have been stopped\r\nof late! One sees here the famous Yunnan yellow pigs, and peculiar\r\nwhite and black fowl, whose bones and skin are black, probably on\r\naccount of iron and copper in what they eat. Boys are driving water\r\nbuffaloes to the rice and maize fields, which have superseded the poppy\r\nplantations. The stores exhibit the famous jade and the Yunnan (Tali)\r\nlandscape-veined marble which is used in the tops of tables, the seats\r\nof chairs and panels of cabinets and screens. Peculiar bamboo and paper\r\ntoys in which the figures move by the heat of a candle, are made, which\r\nis another proof that the Chinese love children more than they are said\r\nto do in many books of travel! The city is famous for its copper and\r\nbronze work. The copper smelting by charcoal up to 1911 was an imperial\r\ngovernment monopoly, the ingots being sent overland to Peking by pack\r\nanimals, which took the route via Sui-fu and Chungking. At the Peking\r\nmint it was used in the heavy “cash” coinage. Yunnan is noted for its\r\ncloth dyers, who as yet use the famous indigo of the province, instead\r\nof analine dye. The tin, iron, pewter and furniture shops are noted,\r\nand foreign models are being copied with success.\r\n\r\nThe city is noted for its modern prison, with model workshops, the best\r\nin China. The police corps, uniformed in knee boots, tight tunics and\r\nGerman caps, and wearing swords, is a model gendarmerie. Yunnan, the\r\nfarthest removed city of the empire from the capital, Peking, has been\r\nthe foremost in these startling reforms since the French railway came\r\nthrough from the coast in 1910. Many Hongkong Chinese, who at once\r\nvisited the place, are largely responsible for this reform leaven, but\r\nthe chief credit is due to the progressive governor, Li Chin Hsi, who,\r\nremote as he was from headquarters, preserved order during the exciting\r\nmonths of 1911–12. In the streets the chair coolies rush along, with\r\nthe right of way, shouting “Pei Ha” (We’ll poke you in the back). It\r\nwas once the king town of opium, where a whole city walked for years\r\nin a sleep, but the government has largely stamped out both poppy\r\nfield and opium joint. On the parade ground on a fall day of 1909,\r\nwith military honors, the governor amusingly burned in public hundreds\r\nof thousands of dollars worth of opium and ivory pipes. On account of\r\nmagnesian limestone and minerals in the water, awful-looking victims\r\nof goitre are constantly met. The poppy fields are now being used by a\r\nwide-awake people for the cultivation of mustard, rice, maize, sugar,\r\nbanana, orange, pomegranates, bamboo, walnuts, etc.\r\n\r\nMany peculiar races and varied costumes are to be seen in this Museum\r\nof Languages: Shans with high black head-dress and a red band across\r\ntheir foreheads; Mohammedans with green turbans; Lolos without queues\r\nand hair piled on the head like men who have a perpetual nightmare;\r\nTibetan women driving their pack trains to their mountain home,\r\nthe “Roof of the World,” and driving their husbands, too! Burmese\r\nwith combs in their hair, though they are not women! Kilted Kachins,\r\ncarrying their long, two-handed dha-swords on their shoulders, and\r\ntheir women wearing bamboo sticks through their ears and chains of\r\nriver shells and colored stones on their necks; Annamese in gorgeous\r\ngold silk, embroidered as though they were on their way to claim a\r\nthrone; daring, dirty Bhamo muleteers, who dare to be full of polyglot\r\noaths, for they wear nothing worth throwing mud at; women riding\r\nponies, donkeys and mules, and trying to evade the thrust of one\r\nanother’s pin-filled hair as though they were on tourney; aboriginal\r\nMiaos and Lolos with figured yellow cloaks like circus clowns, and wide\r\nhats whose rims are stayed down to their shoulders with strings; French\r\nsurveyors in white duck and kettle helmets, and exhausting themselves\r\nwith the vivacious volubility that you listen to on Marseilles’\r\nCannabiere; British in khaki, Calcutta topey-helmets and putties, and\r\nas “cool as cucumbers” both in tongue and temperature, men who “get\r\nthere”; yellow-gowned bonzes wondering where their religion has flown\r\nof late; black-gowned Roman priests and flat-hatted _frères_ of the\r\nMissions d’Etrangeres, wearing Chinese soutanes; gray-gowned Taoists\r\nwho are satisfied with their incomes, because while religion has flown\r\nin China, superstition still sticks; blue-gowned Chinese; flame-robed\r\nTibetan lamas; pink-gowned Buddhists, who are thinking of opening\r\nhotels instead of temples, in which latter there has been a “slump”;\r\nand occasionally an American in a Sabutan hat and a Shangtung silk\r\nsuit, ready for anything, and showing the mood in his eyes and laughter.\r\n\r\nThe district is gorgeous with flowers, camellias, mustard, poppies,\r\nmagnolia, indigo, olive, jasmine, and every kind of fern, bush\r\nand vine. Yunnan is rich in animals, including the tiger and black\r\npanther, and fine skins, and some ivory are to be obtained. Beautiful\r\ncranes and duck are to be seen on the lake. It is also rich in\r\nvaluable lumber, and therefore its furniture stores are notable. Coal,\r\niron, zinc, copper and salt are produced in abundance, and there\r\nis much gold, silver, nickel and quicksilver. The tin mines of Kuo\r\nChia produce 13,000,000 pounds of tin a year. There are also beds\r\nof precious stones, rubies, garnets, sapphires, amethysts, etc. No\r\ndistrict of the empire has so many varied metals as Yunnan. The many\r\nraces keep the province more disjointed than any other. An authority\r\non these aboriginal races is the British consul at Tongyueh, Yunnan,\r\nwhose exhaustive articles have appeared in the London _Geographical\r\nMagazine_. In natural scenery Yunnan presents the most sublime panorama\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nTsinan, the capital of Shangtung province, goes back to 1100 B. C.,\r\nand ethnologically is very interesting, as these are the people of\r\nConfucius and Mencius, the descendants of the Tsi State of original\r\nChina. The city, which is walled and moated, is quite beautiful with\r\ntrees, springs, mosques, theaters and temples. There are hills all\r\nabout, and inside the walls on the north a lake dotted with islands,\r\non which memorial arches and temples have been erected. Communication\r\nwith the sea is had by the famous Yellow River (“China’s Sorrow” of\r\nflood), and the Grand Canal is also in touch. The German railway gives\r\nconnection with the east, and national railways are to run north,\r\nsouth and west. Fine glass and the famous colored vitreous crockery,\r\ncalled liu-li, are made here. The guild halls and jewelry shops on Kuan\r\nTi and Fu Run Boulevards are very interesting. The mineral springs\r\nwill doubtless gather sanatorium hotels. There is a girls’ school,\r\na military school, an arsenal, and a modern native university in the\r\nsuburbs, where English preferably and German are used in scientific\r\nstudies, and peculiarly music is also studied. The markets are well\r\nsupplied by a province rich in agriculture. Missions, colleges and\r\nmedical schools, like those of the Baptists and Presbyterians, have\r\na strategic center at Tsinan, as millions of Confucian and Mencian\r\npilgrims come here on their way to the shrine of Taishan Mountain, and\r\nthe birthplaces at Kufow (Yenchow), and Tsou, respectively.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that the Duke Kung and other members of the Kung\r\nfamily will take their places in China’s government, intellectual and\r\nreligious life. They are the oldest family on earth, older than the\r\nMikado’s ancestry, and China could with genuine and lasting pride\r\ngather around real leaders of the Kung family for noble causes. A plan\r\nhas been drawn up by which, if the Chinese republic is a failure, an\r\nexperiment will be made to enthrone one of the Kungs (Confucius), who\r\nhappens to be a Christian He would be in somewhat of a quandary, as his\r\nappeal to the Chinese would have to be that he was born a Confucian,\r\nand his appeal to the five nations would be that he was a Christian.\r\nStill a little thing as that might not bother a Chinese diplomat! It\r\nnever did in the Manchu days of twist and turn, _volte-face_, and come\r\nback again, smiling ever! The proposed Union University of all the\r\nAmerican and British denominations in Shangtung will be brought from\r\nWai Hsien and other cities to Tsinan, and this move will be fraught\r\nwith great success, for “in union is strength.” Tsinan, with the\r\nprovince of Shangtung, under the rebel governor, Sun Hao Chi, went over\r\nto the revolution on November 13, 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS AND MISSIONARY CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nBuddhism, the religion of China which owns most of the finer pagodas\r\nand temples, celebrated in 1912 the 2500th anniversary of Buddha.\r\nThey do not celebrate Buddha’s birth in the body, but rather birth\r\nin the mind or soul, the celebration being called “the anniversary\r\nof Buddha’s enlightenment.” Despite the troubles that Buddhism has\r\nencountered at the instigation of the government’s amban in Tibet, the\r\ncelebration occurred there with avidity, as it did also in Mongolia,\r\nat Kuren, etc. Throughout the rest of the land, despite the prominence\r\nof Confucianism, Taoism and Christianity, the Buddhists made their\r\nanniversary well known. Every one was interested in those who once\r\ntaught that man should be clean, and sincere in good works, and should\r\nlove his fellow man disinterestedly. The thousand little rules for\r\npurchasing a specific pardon in the next world have, however, confused\r\nthe Chinese mind, and many of those who looked on called the ritual\r\nnow merely a mass of superstition. No one can deny that this is the\r\nworld’s most picturesque religion which the Chinese imported from India\r\nso long ago, and of which they are now the leading exponents. There\r\nare temples in San Francisco, San Jose, Sacramento and London also. If\r\nBuddhism were purified from its accretion of rites, and took up again\r\nvigorous sermons on the virtues, responsibility and self-sacrifice, as\r\nin the days when Asoka’s preachers started out to convert the world\r\nto doctrines of service, it would not be a long step from Buddhism to\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\nArchitecturally, the world enthuses over Buddhism, and now that travel\r\nto China is increasing, a cry is going up over the artistic world:\r\n“Save the incomparable pagodas and temples for art’s sake, for they can\r\nnever be repeated, the spirit having departed.” Many of the temples\r\nare dropping to pieces, as in the break-up of old faiths the bonzes\r\nhave been unable to collect the money which is necessary for upkeep.\r\nThe government is maintaining some of the temples, but it uses them as\r\nschools, and the monks themselves have turned some of the temples into\r\ninns. The nation, rich merchants and interested foreigners might take\r\npart in preserving these beautiful monuments, and Christianity, which\r\nis spreading in China, is wide enough in its charity to appreciate\r\nand wish to preserve the beautiful architecture of Buddhism. Let\r\nexperiments be tried; let the government, with its supreme authority,\r\nbuy out some beautiful Buddhist temples and pagodas and turn them over\r\nas headquarters to Christian schools or medical missions. The Buddhist\r\nmonks are a forlorn-looking set, their parishioners contributing too\r\nlittle for their support. This parsimony has induced the monks to\r\ninvent the system of superstitious credit indulgences and absolutions,\r\nwhich, by working on their fears regarding the future life, they compel\r\nthe Chinese--particularly the women--to buy.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the statues of Buddha are solemn or gentle-faced, as in the\r\nTemple of the Five Hundred Genii at Canton. But there is one hilarious\r\nexception, the laughing gilded Buddha of the Ming Hong Temple, near\r\nShanghai. The god’s eyebrows, nose, eyes, mouth and chin all curve\r\ninto great bows of mirth, like the irresistible Coquelin’s face in a\r\nfull-blooded comedy, or DeWolf Hopper’s face in _Wang!_ The Buddhist\r\npriests who run inns keep a guests’ literary book, in which one will\r\nfind sentiments written by many of the world’s noted travelers. The\r\npriests wear a yellow gown. Over the left shoulder hangs an over-gown,\r\nmade of square red patches, sewed together, typifying the vow and rags\r\nof poverty. On the walls of the famous Lung Chang Buddhist Monastery,\r\nnear Chingtu, in Szechuen province, hangs a celebrated text reconciling\r\nBuddhist and Christian teachings on the doctrine of peace. The Chinese\r\nhang a popular text on the walls, which corresponds with “God bless our\r\nhome.” It is “Tien Kun Kong Fuk” (May Heaven send happiness).\r\n\r\nDisfiguring by branding, just as the Romanists used to flagellate\r\nthemselves, has not died out in China, for some of the Buddhist and\r\nTaoist monks of Soochow and elsewhere bear regular scars on their\r\nshaven heads and on their limbs, placed there to show penance during\r\nfasts, and to gain a reputation for holiness, or to use the Chinese\r\nphrase, “attain virtue.” The late Empress Dowager Tse Hsi liked to\r\nassume the character of the Buddhist goddess Kwan Yun, and have herself\r\npainted with bare feet riding on a lotus leaf; in her hand a rosary;\r\nand wearing a blue veil, gray robes, a gold, garnet and pearl crown,\r\nearrings and necklaces. The eunuchs and friends of the empress always\r\nreferred to her as the “Old Buddha,” which was the nickname that she\r\nliked the best. It is worthy of note that the Taiping rebels in the\r\n60’s destroyed Buddhist temples and slew the bonzes, largely because\r\nthe Buddhists of that time were opposed to progress and oppressed the\r\npoor with their “privileged orders.” On account of his not marrying,\r\nthe Chinese call a bonze a “Chek Ke” (forsake family). They are,\r\ntherefore, despised by Chinese men, but have a stronger hold on the\r\nwomen, with their picturesque religion, and good omens whenever they\r\nare paid for them.\r\n\r\nOn the first and fifteenth of each month, a musical service is held\r\nbefore dawn in the two thousand Confucian temples scattered throughout\r\nChina. These temples all contribute a little toward the support of\r\nConfucius’s seventy-seventh direct descendant, Prince Kung Fut Tsze\r\n(which Latinized is Confucius), of Shangtung, though some of the Kungs\r\nare Christians. The Confucian temples contain red and gold tablets\r\nof Confucius and his disciples instead of the statues appearing in\r\nthe Buddhist, Taoist and War temples of the land. When Kwang Hsu, the\r\nreform emperor, issued an edict in 1898 that modern schools should\r\nbe formed, he ordered that some of the Confucian temples should be\r\nimpressed. Confucius did not institute ancestor worship in 550 B. C.\r\nHe found that it existed in his own state of Lu (present Shangtung\r\nprovince) and in the adjoining states of Tsi on the north and Wei and\r\nSung on the west, all of whom had taken it, with the sacred tripods,\r\nfrom the parent Chou clan, which brought them from misty prehistoric\r\ndays thousands of years back. To Confucius, credit should be given for\r\nadopting ancestor worship as an indispensable rite in the organization\r\nof the growing Tsu clan and of the future conqueror and federator of\r\nChina, the Tsin clan, which latter eventually ended feudalism, which\r\nwas then, however, adopted by Japan and carried forward to our own\r\nday. Let us quote here the stern Carlyle’s sympathetic tribute to the\r\nancestor worship of the Chinese: “The emperor and his millions visit\r\nyearly the tombs of their fathers; each man the tomb of his father and\r\nhis mother; alone there, in silence, with what of worship or of other\r\nthought there may be, pauses solemnly each man; the divine skies all\r\nsilent over, the divine graves--and this divinest grave--all silent\r\nunder him; the pulsings of his own soul alone audible. Truly it may be\r\na kind of worship. Truly if a man can not get some glimpse into the\r\nEternities, looking through this portal, through what other need he\r\ntry it?” Attempts have been, and doubtless will continue to be made to\r\nrevivify or modernize Confucianism. The most notable of the viceroys,\r\nChang Chih Tung, of Wuchang, wrote a book called _China’s Only Hope_\r\nwith this in view. Confucius was averse to liquor. One of the odes of\r\nthe _Book of Odes_, written 1100 B. C., and edited by Confucius, rails\r\nagainst drunkenness. The ode realistically describes a riotous banquet\r\nwhich might have taken place in hilarious Vladivostok in 1904, previous\r\nto the war, when sweet Roederer ran like water.\r\n\r\nThe Pope of Taoism dwells on Lung Hu Mountain, in Kiangsi province.\r\nTaoism’s book, the _Tao Teh King_, written in 604 B. C. by Lao Tsz,\r\nspeaks of the Triune God of reason, nature and virtue. The sect is now\r\none of astrologers and nature worshipers, and is strong in the southern\r\nand eastern provinces. It builds temples and teaches the nature\r\nsuperstition of Feng Shui (Wind and Water), which until recently held\r\nthe land in thrall against mining, industry and railways. The Taoists\r\nhave been bitterly anti-foreign. Bows and arrows are sometimes hung up\r\nin the green Taoist temples as votive or thank offerings, the sentiment\r\nbeing that they are to kill one’s unpropitious influence or adverse\r\nFeng-shui. Taoist priests sometimes wear gorgeous gowns completely\r\ncovered with embroidery of flowers, insects, birds, animals and the\r\nexorcised devil himself. They make a pretty penny by publishing or\r\ninterpreting an almanac, the day selected possibly reading as follows:\r\n\r\n                               June 10th\r\n\r\nLUCKY:\r\n\r\n  To set sail to-day.\r\n  To begin a land journey to-day.\r\n  To begin a suit to-day.\r\n\r\nUNLUCKY:\r\n\r\n  To bury your father to-day.\r\n  To begin a new well to-day.\r\n  To bargain for a wife for your son to-day.\r\n  To buy oil to-day.\r\n  To sweep your shop to-day.\r\n  To hire a cook to-day.\r\n\r\nThe traveler who has everything ready at Ichang to start on the long\r\njourney through the glorious Yangtze gorges and rapids often wonders\r\nwhy his men can not be induced to start. The reason is that they are\r\nwading through the Luck Book, thus wasting an unnecessary week. Oil\r\nis needed, but it can not be bought on June 5th. Fish are needed, but\r\ncan not be bought on June 6th. Rope can not be bought on June 7th, and\r\nwhen June 9th comes along it is unlucky to sail on that day. The Taoist\r\npriest makes his money by selling your laota (captain) an indulgence to\r\nsail on June 9th, for which you have to pay handsomely about ten cents,\r\nand the kinshan incense and firecrackers extra! The tiger and the\r\ndragon represent the early gods of the terrified aboriginal Chinese,\r\nand predate the ancestor worship of the first Chou clan of the north.\r\nThese emblems have been adopted by the Taoist priests. The grotesque\r\nshrines are found among the mountains, a dominating view being\r\nnecessary for the casting of the “influence.”\r\n\r\nAmong the aboriginal Lolo tribes of Yunnan an animal represents\r\neach day of the month. Accordingly the body of a caravaner is kept\r\nfor burial until the lucky day of the horse arrives. A coin is put\r\nbetween the lips to pay the way, which shows that the rites are\r\nTaoist, and quite similar to old Grecian and Egyptian rites. When the\r\nrevolutionists were fortifying Hanyang, in October, 1911, they did not\r\nhesitate to use a Taoist monastery as a fort in the hills. This marks a\r\nstep forward against old superstitions, which were once insurmountable.\r\nThe Chinese declare that a positive omen of a coming conflagration is\r\nthe crowing of a cock during the night. Of course, all the cooks of\r\nHankau recited this to their masters on the day when the imperialists\r\nburned the native city. Statues are many in the temples, monasteries,\r\nguild halls, pagodas and road shrines. Although Confucius is generally\r\nrepresented by a tablet merely, there are some temples which have\r\nstatues of him and his disciples. Buddha is represented by three\r\nstatues of the Past, Present and Future Buddha. Emperors of popular\r\ndynasties have statues erected to them in the temples. Then the Taoists\r\nhave innumerable gods, including the famous gods of the War Temples.\r\nThe guilds of the three hundred trades and twenty-one provinces all\r\nhave patron gods, and it is orthodox to rub your finger on the god’s\r\nbody in the place that corresponds with your sore spot, if you feel\r\nill! You touch his back if you have lumbago (and find out that he is\r\nhollow!); his nose if you have asthma, and so on.\r\n\r\nThere are household gods; a god “Tsan” of the kitchen; pictures of gods\r\nto paste on the gates of the compound, and the God of Literature, who\r\nis very popular and has many temples. All over the north the Manchus\r\nhave erected temples to the Fox, their wily patron god. This dependence\r\non idols is not so dense as in India. The Chinese do it more as a good\r\nluck omen, just as we wear an opal or a turquoise, and not always as\r\nan essential religious rite. They have too much humor really to be as\r\nfoolish as they may look when in the god’s presence. A god who doesn’t\r\ndo his business well is as quickly dragged out by a rope and burned\r\nin times of stress as a human being would be treated with contumely\r\nwhose prophecies always failed. In the south, religious edifices are\r\nbeing occupied for educational and civic purposes. When in 1908 the\r\nnew learning broke over China like the full burst of a tropical day,\r\nthe schools at first had to be housed in temples and monasteries.\r\nRecently, at Canton, the Wah Lum Monastery was used to entertain\r\na public-spirited Chinese of Singapore, Chang U. Him, who brought\r\nboth new learning and new wealth. “All interested in industries,\r\nself-government, charities and new education” were invited by circular\r\nto come up and see him “at the temple!”\r\n\r\nSome of their religious proverbs, often touched with humor, are:\r\n\r\n“If you must thrash a priest, wait until he has finished praying for\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Man’s myriad schemes are not equal to a thought of God.”\r\n\r\n“God gives birth and death to every man, but honors only to the few who\r\ndeserve them.”\r\n\r\n“The deeper your cave, the smaller is your heaven.”\r\n\r\n“Man’s blow hits everything but heaven.”\r\n\r\n“Do no wrong by light, and you’ll see no devil at night.”\r\n\r\n“Penitence is good, but it should be proved by pennies.”\r\n\r\n“Though the face is paler, the sin isn’t any whiter.”\r\n\r\n“When things go well, we are so hungry that we eat all the meal; when\r\ntrouble comes, we are glad to give it all to the idol.”\r\n\r\n“Forget the priest on a fair day, but hug his idol on a foul.”\r\n\r\n“A maker of idols never goes to a temple.”\r\n\r\n“Fire for gold and trial for the soul.”\r\n\r\n“Sorrow for the saint, and chisel for the statue.”\r\n\r\n“Sorrow ends where sin begins.”\r\n\r\n“Speak of the devil and he drops in.”\r\n\r\n“Kind words outlive much frost.”\r\n\r\n“Heaven calls the good soon, but doesn’t want the bad till the last.”\r\n\r\n“The devil disguises himself less than his followers do.”\r\n\r\n“When you forgive your enemy, the wrong pains less.”\r\n\r\n“The silver whisper is loudest in the idol’s ear.”\r\n\r\n“The whole earth is a coffin; only for the living the lid is not yet\r\nhammered down.”\r\n\r\n“A lie is like burying the dead in the snow; the secrecy doesn’t last\r\nlong.”\r\n\r\n“The brows of the saints prop the pillars of heaven.”\r\n\r\nSays a northern pessimist: “Oh! the hypocrisy of religion; sacrifice a\r\nbullock once a year, and steal bullocks all the rest of the year.”\r\n\r\nThe supercilious man threw this sarcastic shaft at his accoster: “_I_\r\npick _my_ company.” The mission school man heaped coals of fire on his\r\nhead with this bland reply: “And your company is proud to pick you.”\r\n\r\nThe Chinese love to contrast life and death, as is shown in their\r\npaintings of pear trees in bloom and willows in bud, while snow lies on\r\nmountain peak and hillside.\r\n\r\nThe Americans at home have established a beautiful custom of casting\r\nwreaths into the sea on Decoration Day in commemoration of the dead who\r\nwere buried or lost at sea, and there is a similar custom at Venice\r\nand elsewhere. The Chinese, too, have a Decoration or All Souls’ Day,\r\nwhich is observed by the adherents of the three religions in the first\r\nweek of September. Red boats and lanterns are set afloat, and the\r\npriests burn paper clothing, money and food, and set off firecrackers.\r\nWhere the ceremony takes place on land, it is customary to throw\r\ncopper money to the street gamins. The festival is also observed at\r\nthe magisterial yamens and temples, and Wing Lok Street, Hongkong,\r\nis noted for the characteristic observance of the ceremony. The rise\r\nof republicanism is going to strike a hard blow at one of the main\r\nteachings of Confucianism, “serving the prince,” because there will be\r\nno prince to serve and also at “li,” the rule of blind obedience to\r\nthose in power; following the trade of the parent; destroying children;\r\nself-disfigurement; concubinage; expensive funerals and priest-craft;\r\nabuse of women; blind worship of the past; suicide of purchased wives;\r\nexaggeration of man and minimizing of God; neglect of organized\r\ncharities and of science and comparative history. This change will make\r\nthe introduction of Christianity more hopeful. It is to be expected\r\nthat the worship of ancestors will also weaken, and with it will weaken\r\nthe custom of early marriages. The Chinese have too many children to\r\neducate properly, as the Americans and French have probably too few. A\r\nsomewhat smaller China would mean a richer and better China.\r\n\r\nCatholic missions began in China when by caravan Corvina visited Kublai\r\nKhan, at Peking, in 1292 A. D. Ricci arrived at Canton in 1582 and\r\nworked in many of the provincial capitals and at Macao and Peking.\r\nSchaal worked from 1622 to 1664 and had influence with the greatest and\r\nmost artistic Manchu emperor, Kang Hi. Abbé Huc covered the country\r\nfrom Peking and Tibet to Macao from 1844 onward. The chief educational\r\ncenters of the Romanists are at Peking, Tientsin, Canton, Macao,\r\nSaigon and Hongkong. The large press and college of the Missiones\r\nd’Etrangeres is at Hongkong (Aberdeen side of the island). At Peking\r\nis their extensive Pei Tang press. They have large, two-spired Gothic\r\ncathedrals at Canton, Peking, etc. The square towered cathedral on\r\nCaine Road, Hongkong, is the architectural crown of the lovely colony.\r\nThe Catholics number 1,500,000, their work being strong in orphanages,\r\namong women, etc., and in comparison with Protestant missions very weak\r\nin higher education and the distributed Bible itself. They consider\r\nit expedient to train the child rather than to make the expensive\r\nexperiment of reasoning with and educating the man. Therefore most\r\nof the modernized Chinese officials are Protestants. Naturally the\r\nCatholic method brings more converts than does the Protestant.\r\n\r\nThe American missions almost dominate in the expensive higher education\r\nof the land, and it now seems certain that American educational\r\nmethods, thoroughly tried in China, will be adopted over the world\r\nbecause of their efficiency and altruism. The Protestant missions\r\nof Europe, working in China, are as follows: The Scandinavians work\r\nin Hupeh and the northern provinces, and while not rich, they have\r\ndeveloped effective fearless men of great resource. The German\r\nLutherans are active at Kiaochou, and in the north and the Yangtze\r\nvalley. The English Baptists, dating back to 1792, have many missions,\r\nnotably in Shangtung province. The London Missionary Society (mainly\r\nCongregational), dating back to 1795, operates largely along the coast,\r\nin the south, and at Peking. The Church of Scotland (both Free and\r\nEstablished), which is strong in medical missions, operates notably in\r\nManchuria. The Presbyterian and Methodist Churches of England have\r\nmany missions throughout the land. The Anglican Church operates chiefly\r\nin the great ports; is now strong in higher education, and has erected\r\nmany fine cathedrals. It has taken under its wing the foreigner in\r\nChina, who, Kipling charged, did many reckless things “east of Suez!”\r\nEven the Friends’ Society of England has missions in China. The China\r\nInland Mission, founded by the noted Doctor Hudson Taylor in 1862,\r\nhas eight hundred missionaries who altruistically accept the smallest\r\nsalaries paid in China. Many of them live on the land, in the “faith”\r\nmethod. The method of the organization is by personal contact rather\r\nthan by expensive, highly organized education. For years this was the\r\nmost dramatic and heroic mission in the darker provinces of the land.\r\nThe Salvation Army has also come to China through the world-binding\r\nlove of that extraordinary man, “General” Booth. American missions\r\ndominate in Protestant China, British and Colonial missions being\r\none-half as strong, which means an equal zeal when the population of\r\nthe two countries is considered.\r\n\r\nAmerican missions are stronger in educational, political and medical\r\nactivities; the British make a specialty of preaching, charities\r\nand personal work. The Americans develop more native preachers and\r\ntranslators than any of the other missions, and their confidence in\r\nthe Chinese is producing wonderful results in reaching toward the\r\nestablishment of a self-sustaining church some day. No work, except\r\nthe medical missions, has, however, ever surpassed the aim of the\r\nBritish and Foreign and American Bible Societies to put a translated\r\nBible in the hands of every Chinese. China, foremost of all lands,\r\nranks learning above everything else. By its attitude in specializing\r\nin education, the American church has attracted the sympathy of the\r\nleaders of the nation. No nation has a monopoly of mission heroes, but\r\nthe wisdom of the American decision has been at once apparent.\r\n\r\nThe Roman missions work largely on the medieval plan of: “Give me the\r\nchild till he is thirteen and I don’t care who gets it after that.” The\r\nAmerican Protestants and some of the British say: “Give him to me from\r\nthirteen to twenty-three, so that he can understand.” One proselytizes\r\npossibly by prejudice and association. The other, imparting all the\r\nknowledge possible, trusts to the mind and sense of cultivated justice\r\nin the pupil. The Roman orphanages in China outnumber the Protestants\r\nfive to one. The high-grade schools and colleges of the Americans are\r\nalmost alone in the field, though the British propose now to follow\r\nvigorously. The difference is in attitude. There is no difference\r\nbetween Romanist and Protestant missionary in China in braving death\r\nfrom the hands of pirates, persecution from “Boxers” and others,\r\nmisery, disease and alienation. The heroes are numberless; their lives\r\nare thrilling; their aims are the most altruistic the world has known,\r\nand the orchard is in such a flower of fruitage now as to dazzle the\r\naltruist’s eye.\r\n\r\nIt was a matter of great interest to foreigners when the October,\r\n1911, revolution opened, that the chief leader and organizer of the\r\nmovement, Doctor Sun Yat Sen (Sunyacius) was a Christian, the son of a\r\nCantonese (Fatshan) evangelist. It will be remembered that Siu Tsuen,\r\nthe leader of the 1848 Taiping rebellion, which marched from Canton\r\nto Nanking via the Mei Ling pass, was also a Cantonese Christian, but\r\ninfinitely inferior to Doctor Sun in education and experience, as well\r\nas in character. Eventually Siu fell away from the faith, under the\r\ninfluence of bad advisers, into savagery. The missions were all given\r\nadvance information previous to the October, 1911, revolution, showing\r\nthat the Chinese esteem missionaries ahead of diplomats. This is a\r\nvery precious compliment, and marks the vast advance of Christianity\r\nin the hearts of the Chinese “Hoi Polloi.” Even before the October,\r\n1911, rebellion, officials of the old class were throwing away their\r\nprejudices against missionaries and welcoming them as angels of light\r\nin a way that would have delighted Paul and Barnabas. General Tsen Chun\r\nHsuan, a bloody enough loyalist leader in war, when viceroy of Szechuen\r\nprovince, made this address: “My hope is that the missionary teachers\r\nand medical missionaries of America and Britain will spread their\r\ngospel more widely than ever, and that the influence of the gospel may\r\nbring boundless happiness for our people of China. I shall not be the\r\nonly one to thank you for your good work. Long live your Gospel.”\r\n\r\nThe literal name by which the Roman church goes in China is “Tien Chu”\r\n(Heaven Lord church), and the Protestants are generally called by the\r\nCatholics and by the Chinese “Jesus church,” or “Shangti” (Supreme\r\nRuler church). The American Episcopalians and the British Anglicans\r\nin April, 1912, decided to call themselves the “Holy Public church”\r\n(Sheng Kung Hwei). The Roman missionaries had much to do with the\r\nannexation of vast Tonquin (population twenty-two millions) by France,\r\nand their activity is similarly ambitious in Yunnan province, lower\r\nSzechuen, and in Kwangsi and Kweichou provinces. As long ago as 1844,\r\nso brave a traveler and learned a priest as Abbé Huc insisted on\r\nwearing the yellow robe of the privileged mandarin class. Not only at\r\none station or in one province did he do this, but on his journey of\r\n1849 through Tibet, Szechuen, Hupeh, Kiangsi and Kwangtung provinces,\r\nhe wore the robe and demanded the reception of a mandarin, the thinly\r\nveiled implication being that if he was interfered with, there were\r\nFrench guns that could pound the Taku and Bogue forts on the way to\r\nTientsin and Canton, respectively, which they really did ten years\r\nlater. As late as 1899, when China was torn by dissensions between the\r\nreformers and the reactionaries, and while the wounds of her defeat by\r\nJapan were still open, the Roman church, with the diplomatic aid of\r\nFrance, forced from the then Tsung Li Yamen (Foreign Board) an imperial\r\nrescript granting Roman priests the rank and insignia of a Chinese\r\nperfect (mandarin), and Roman bishops the astoundingly high title and\r\ninsignia of a viceroy, which honors affected eleven hundred priests\r\nand forty-six bishops. It was not until 1909 that China resolved to\r\nthrow off this incubus. The rescript was rescinded by the new Wai Wu Pu\r\n(Foreign Board) and Li Pu (Board of Rites). Enlightened Romanists in\r\nAmerica of course do not uphold such militant Romanism, which smacks\r\nrather much of the bizarre days of Cortez. Let it be said too that the\r\nFrench Romanist abroad is more medieval than the French Romanist in\r\nFrance. While sailing in the Red Sea, talking with French clerics from\r\nTajoora, which faces the hot Gulf of Aden, and while walking along\r\nthe red banks of the Saigon River in Indo-China, I have heard bitter\r\ncriticisms from French priests which would have been deemed _lèse\r\nmajesté_ in the home republic itself.\r\n\r\nA traveler can not pass through China without being mobbed by the sick\r\nto be cured. “You are a foreigner, you _must_ be a doctor; cure me and\r\nmine; I have heard that the foreigners can cure any ill; cure me, man\r\nof Jesus.” It is agonizing. I knew a man who only carried a caustic\r\nstick and two drugs (quinine and salts). Wherever he was mobbed with\r\nappeals he administered these drugs to those whom he thought they would\r\nbenefit. Almost better if he had not done so. The cured who leaped\r\nabout with new life were enough proof that he was “lying” when he said\r\nthat he could not heal the wounded, the seriously ill, the leprous and\r\nthe ulcered. He was almost torn apart. Were I a billionaire, I am a\r\nthousand times sure that I would send a thousand medical missionaries\r\nto China for five years, each man to hire a Chinese understudy, and\r\ncarry a full surgical and medical chest, and the Bible and medical text\r\nbooks only. Then I would leave the Chinese pupils to carry on the work;\r\nthey would be stationed as radiating centers at proper distances apart\r\nthroughout the land. I would then spend the rest of my life listening\r\nto the marvelous stories which my five thousand friends had to tell\r\nof what they had seen and done. No man who ever lived--not even Paul\r\nwhen he wrote the thirteenth chapter of First Corinthians; not even the\r\nbeloved John when he saw the Heavenly City in seraphic dreams--would\r\nhave experienced such real and wide happiness as I. No man could pass\r\naway with more ecstatic memories, such a delirium of too much joy.\r\n\r\nI want to write a word of commendation of the missionary, for\r\ndetraction by some in high places, and by some authors who write as\r\nthey fly and flit at the ports, is not uncommon. The attacks upon\r\nmissions in Henry Norman’s _Peoples and Politics of the Far East_,\r\nand in Pumpelly’s _Across America and Asia_, are well known, and have\r\nbeen repeated by others. One may be a cynic at home, and with reason\r\nsometimes criticize some pulpits because they fear the magnate at the\r\nend of some pews, and color their sermons accordingly. One may in\r\na supercilious way sneer at the seeming lack of personality in the\r\nmissionary candidate, who in a gentle faith stands up in her or his\r\nchurch to answer the call: “Go ye into all the world and preach the\r\ngospel to every creature.” But follow the worker into the China field,\r\nand see what that call and the altruistic opportunity has done by its\r\nvery immensity. The gentle missionary has soon become many things: a\r\nbrave pioneer in exile; a scholar and linguist; an organizer of great\r\npower and tact; a local foreign minister of great ability in adapting\r\nthe West to the East; a scientist, housekeeper, traveler, physician,\r\nexplorer, ethnologist, nurse, orator; the only host of explorers; the\r\nmost generous of mankind; an ideal example of what the West should\r\nbe; the most inspired of human beings in self-sacrifice and wonderful\r\naccomplishment under difficulties. Their expenses are many; their\r\nresources few. Many have to live on the slimmest of contributions\r\nfrom home, such as the missionaries of the China Inland Mission, the\r\nScandinavian Mission, and the Scottish Missions, which are not rich.\r\n\r\nMany, like the American and English missionaries, receive fair help\r\nfrom home, but spend on their equipment, and educational and hospital\r\nbuildings the money that was due to themselves and their families\r\nas salaries. The highly cultured, brave president of the Nanking\r\nUniversity accepts only $1,500 as salary, whereas if he were in\r\nAmerica, on a purely business basis he would be expected to demand\r\n$15,000 for the same services and expenses of his high position. The\r\nwriter does not mean to select one board as doing better than another.\r\nAll have done marvelously, and China can never forget. In the Yangtze\r\nvalley at Shanghai and Wuchang, along the whole front of the rebellion\r\nof 1911, the American Episcopalians have universities and training\r\nschools, which were especially noted by the republicans. The missionary\r\ndoes not always desire money. Such a simple thing as a magazine, or\r\na new book of travel, or a standard work of fiction, or a weekly\r\nnewspaper from some metropolis, is a god-send to the missionaries at\r\nthe outposts, under the idol’s hills, who like to feel that though\r\nthey are thousands of miles from a treaty port, they are yet in touch\r\nwith civilization. Any one can get from the Mission Boards the names of\r\nmissionaries who are off the beaten track from Yunnan province up to\r\nthe Amur River in China, and send them now and then at trifling cost\r\nthis cheering literature, which will shine upon them like the beloved\r\nsun of the far-away home land. Treat them as American and British men\r\nand women, and not only in the high light of missionaries, for they are\r\nthe ambassadors from the West to the East, and there is no form of our\r\ncivilization in which they are not active, efficient and heroic.\r\n\r\nEngland and America contribute the same sum to missions, but as England\r\nis the smaller, the statistics reveal that America is doing only half\r\nwhat she should do in the China mission field. Of the denominations,\r\nthe American Methodists easily lead the world, followed in order by the\r\nAnglican Church of England, the Presbyterian Church of America, the\r\nBaptist Church of America, and the old Congregational Church of America\r\nwith many heroes on its old roster, which dates back to 1812. If you\r\nask what the Chinese think of missionaries I will quote the following\r\nprayer spoken by the Confucian viceroy, Hsi Liang, in the Scotch\r\nchapel at Mukden for the hero physician, Doctor Jackson, who died as a\r\nvoluntary martyr in the pneumonic plague in 1910, and you can answer\r\nwhether you do not think it eloquently pathetic: “Doctor Jackson, with\r\nthe heart of your Christ, who died to save the world, came to our aid\r\nwhen we besought him to help our country in its hour of distress.\r\nDaily, where the plague lay thickest, amidst the groans of the dying,\r\nhe struggled to help the stricken to find medicine. Worn out by his\r\nefforts the pest seized and took him long before his time. Our sorrow\r\nis beyond all measure; our grief too deep for words. Oh! Spirit of\r\nDoctor Jackson, we pray you to intercede for the twenty million people\r\nin Manchuria, and ask the Lord of Heaven to take away this plague so\r\nthat we may once more lay our heads in peace upon our pillows. In life\r\nyou were brave; you, therefore, now are a spirit. Noble Spirit, who\r\ngave up your life for us, help us still, look down with sympathy upon\r\nus all.”\r\n\r\nY. M. C. A’s. are being built in the treaty ports, largely through\r\nAmerican endeavor. The Japanese sphere, Tientsin, etc., are provided\r\nfor, and the Chicago Y. M. C. A. raised a large sum of money for a\r\nY. M. C. A. in Hongkong. The sailors in Hongkong contribute the third\r\nlargest amount to their missions (being exceeded only by Wellington\r\nand Liverpool) of any port in the world. I am not referring to amounts\r\ncollected from passengers on steamers, but the support given by the\r\nsailors themselves. This shows that Jack Tar and John Celestial\r\nrecognize the manly and godly worth of the “sky pilot”, even if they\r\npivot many of their jokes on his solemn patience.\r\n\r\nSince Morrison’s translation, there have been quite a number of\r\ntranslations into the official Mandarin, and even into Romanized\r\nletters expressing the dialects of the southern provinces. This latter\r\nBible can only be understood by mission school pupils. In 1890 the\r\nmissionary bodies met at Peking and determined to translate the whole\r\nBible into approved characters which idiomatized better certain words\r\nwhich had been improperly understood in former translations. The\r\ncommittee meets once a year at different cities in China. By 1910 the\r\nNew Testament and the Psalms had been completed, and the whole Bible\r\nwill probably be completed by 1918. The head translator is the American\r\nPresbyterian educator, Doctor Mateer, the founder of Shangtung Union\r\nUniversity at Wei Hsien and Tsinan, and the noted Doctor W. A. P.\r\nMartin, the author and educator of Peking, is another translator.\r\n\r\nShintoism (the Japanese adaptation of Confucianism) has been found\r\nlacking in Japan, as it raises no positive God-fearing sentiment in\r\nthe masses, no national morality, no individual conscientiousness\r\nwhich can be relied on when the letter of the law fails. This is the\r\nrock strength which Christianity has given the West, and the Chinese\r\nrepublicans see what they have missed in not adopting Christianity.\r\nOn February 9, 1912, the Japanese home minister called a conference\r\nof the Buddhist, Confucian (Shinto), and Christian religions, to see\r\nwhat could be done to strengthen Japan’s creeds, so that the state\r\nwould benefit in that moral and God-fearing power which Christianity\r\nhas given to the western masses. Christianity makes but one answer to\r\nChina, and that is to take Christianity and the Bible as a religion\r\nand a revelation, and reduce Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism to the\r\nethical and literary place which Socrates, Plato, Homer, Virgil, etc.,\r\noccupy in western thought and practise. President Sun Yat Sen, of the\r\nNanking Confederated Assemblies of South China, appreciates this, and\r\nhas promised the Chinese Christians that he will do all he can in time\r\nto form a Chinese Christian church; not a Roman or Greek or American\r\nor British church, but a free Chinese Christian church. When China\r\ntakes the Bible nearest of all books to her heart, and has her own\r\nhead bishop in each denomination absolutely free, she will then have\r\nachieved greatness and glory, and found joy and truth.\r\n\r\nThe troublesome temperance question of the military canteen has been\r\nsolved, I think, under severest tropical conditions at Hongkong,\r\nwhere there is a large garrison, and despite well meaning W. C. T.\r\nU’s. at home under different conditions, the canteen, where “vice is\r\nregulated”, has, I believe, come to stay for a while. At one time the\r\nsoldier drifted into the slums. He sighed for company as only an alien\r\namong the heathen can sigh. He drank bad liquor and was robbed when\r\ndrugged thereby. That he will drink liquor must be accepted, as he is\r\nthe rougher sort of man, although worthy for all that. He committed\r\noffenses before the tender eye of the public, brought the service into\r\nill repute, and cost the municipality money for trials and police. He\r\nendangered international peace, for in his “cups” he was always seeing\r\ndifferences instead of amenities when he met a soldier of another\r\nnation. He made himself unfit for real war. The Army and Navy Canteen,\r\nor Club, was adopted, I think, largely on Lord Roberts’ suggestion (and\r\nwho will question “Bob’s” wisdom). The soldier was put on his honor\r\nand he rose fully to his opportunity. The sergeants on guard permitted\r\nsufficient indulgence, but regulated rows. Most of the men drank less,\r\nbecause they felt that they were drinking in “their own home”, but\r\nif they over-drank, their fellows were on hand to see that they were\r\ntaken to barracks without being dragged through the public streets.\r\nGood liquor was supplied. Disease decreased, as the men were contented\r\nin barracks. Authority was respected, for it comes as second nature\r\nfor even a drunken soldier to obey a soldier. The soldier is now never\r\nrobbed; his life is safe; he saves money, and he drinks less because\r\nhe drinks “as a gentleman what ’as ’is Club wi’ the best on ’em.” The\r\nW. C. T. U. is a necessary theory; the Soldiers’ Canteen of Hongkong,\r\nManila, and Delhi, is a brilliant compromise which should be accepted\r\nas a solution until the world is so good that the brave and perhaps\r\nrough soldier is needed no more. Candy is sold to the soldiers, as it\r\nis found that the absorption of carbohydrates greatly decreases the\r\nappetite for alcohol. The Officers’ Army and Navy Cooperative Stores\r\nsell goods to men and their families at cost, and the American army\r\nis to adopt this method to reduce the cost of living at foreign army\r\nposts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\nLEGAL PRACTISE AND CRIME IN CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nBooks and articles that have thrown light on this dark question include\r\nthose of Wu Ting Fang, once minister to America; Mr. Jernigan’s _China\r\nin Law_; Sir G. T. Staunton’s _Penal Code_; Sir C. Alabaster’s _Chinese\r\nCriminal and Property Law_; Parker’s _Chinese Family Law_; Mayer’s\r\n_Chinese Government_; lengthy notes in the _Middle Kingdom_, by the\r\nlearned American, S. Wells Williams; Dyer Ball’s _Things Chinese_;\r\nProfessor Giles’ _Historic China_; Sir Henry Maine’s commentaries; and\r\nthe old _Chinese Repository_. The Hebrew penal code, _Leviticus_, is\r\nantedated by the Chinese penal code of Shun’s reign nearly a thousand\r\nyears. It can not compare, of course, in extent or in lofty principle\r\nwith the Levitican code. Brutal punishments, such as branding,\r\namputation of members, linchee, bambooing and torture made these early\r\nreigns so peaceful that it is said “money lost on the road would be\r\nleft there until the owner returned to find it”. The truth probably\r\nis that this referred to the prince’s money, and that if injustice\r\nwas done the common man, the inferior serf or slave, by the prince or\r\nthe powerful, the weaker had to whistle for his judgment as long then\r\nas he has had to do in subsequent periods of history. Each change of\r\ndynasty brought in a revision of the code, not that it was made more\r\nhumane, but that there were necessary items of _lèse majesté_ to add.\r\nFor instance, the Manchus required that when the emperor passed at\r\nnight, every onlooker (all except the soldiers were kept indoors) was\r\nrequired to turn _volte-face_ on pain of death. There was no procedure\r\nfor revoking a statute. The judge could unexpectedly spring on the\r\nvictim some precedent or law that was followed in the “year one”, and\r\nthe prisoner could plead in vain that another law of the “year two”\r\ngave him a better chance. In other words, the mandarin practically said\r\nwith one of Louis Fourteenth’s judges, to litigants: “_La loi, c’est\r\nmoi_”, and he interpreted the code as he wished! United protest to the\r\nPeking censors, mobbing and refusal to pay taxes were in reality the\r\nonly reprisals that the people could exert against the exactions of an\r\nunjust judge. Confucius, in rendering service as a ruler in two states,\r\ninterpreted codes. One of the states, the Tsin (B. C. 246), shortly\r\nafter Confucius, put in effect the Li Kwai code in six books. Codes of\r\nthe following important dynasties exist: Han, Tsin, Tang, Sung, Yuan,\r\nMing and Tsing (Manchu).\r\n\r\nThe Grecian Thebes, of which Sophocles wrote, was notorious for its\r\ntorture of suspected criminals, and Herodotus relates that the ancient\r\nMedes exercised similar practises. The “third degree” is outrageously\r\ndeveloped in China as in no other country, the law requiring\r\nconfessions in every case before penalty is inflicted. “_More Sinico_”,\r\nthe pepper is rubbed in the eyes, and the confession is forced out\r\nof whomsoever is made the victim. Crimes are often “planted”, and\r\nblackmail of the weaker by the stronger runs riot. The laws themselves\r\nhave been noted for their conciseness and simplicity, the number of\r\nvolumes signifying little as the Chinese ideograph-text is expansive.\r\n“It is prohibited to murder”; “It is prohibited to trespass”, etc.\r\nThere is imperfect codification of precedents and decisions, so that\r\nthe prisoner must rely on himself (or on money!) to explain that the\r\nhomicide was in self-defense; the trespass to escape from a mad dog.\r\nThe spirit is always above the letter; it alone makes perfect law\r\npossible. Where there is a will to do right, right generally prevails,\r\nand it may be said that many of the Chinese judges try to do right,\r\nget at the truth, and give a common-sense judgment, for they are not\r\niron-bound as the Occident is under appeal, precedent, quibble and\r\nevasion; the letter above the spirit. If the case is an action within\r\na clan, the “hsiang lao” (old man of the village) generally assists\r\nthe judge in getting at the truth. If the action is between two clans\r\nof two villages, or between competing guilds, God help the judges in\r\nsifting the truth from the lies! Such situations arouse the sympathy\r\nof disinterested foreigners for Chinese judges. Sometimes the native\r\nis not at fault, as the Chinese viceroys and Foreign Boards have often\r\ncomplained that some of the Romanists and one legation have interfered\r\nto a greater or lesser degree when a nominal Christian, who had a suit\r\nat law, was trying to evade justice by enrolling himself as a “rice\r\nChristian”.\r\n\r\nThe frequent edicts of the throne, published in the Peking _Gazette_,\r\nat once became laws, such as: “It is prohibited to smoke opium;”\r\n“It is prohibited to bind feet,” etc. Law will now be enunciated as\r\nin America, by the central and provincial legislatures of the new\r\nrepublic. A sort of martial law now prevails, and the provinces,\r\nafter a quick drum-head trial, are shooting or lopping off the heads\r\nof pirates and mutinous soldiers in great numbers. Decapitation,\r\nflogging, torture, strangling, stocks, cangue, etc., will all probably\r\nbe retained, as the Chinese are stolid when it comes to bearing pain,\r\nand the criminal classes must be treated with severity. Linchee,\r\nor Ling Chih (cutting into a thousand pieces) may be discontinued\r\nand shooting substituted. If, however, Confucianism remains as the\r\nleading religion, decapitation will be continued. The Confucians\r\nloathe the severing of the head, and this punishment is a powerful\r\ndeterrent of crime. Imprisonment in a modern jail is no punishment for\r\na hard-working Chinese, and something else must be substituted, such as\r\nthe state impressing the convict’s free labor, to offset the convict’s\r\nfamily becoming a charge on the clan or state. It has been found in\r\nYunnan City, Kweilin City and elsewhere that a modern jail, with good\r\nfood and sanitary conditions, induces the poor wretches to commit\r\ncrimes so as to achieve permanent incarceration as quickly as possible!\r\nAs in the French system, the old-style Chinese judge is also often\r\nthe prosecutor, and witnesses and accused are made to fight it out in\r\nthe hearing of the judge, so that as the frequent “lie” is passed,\r\nthe truth may jump from the tossed bag! (_Confronter les témoins à\r\nl’accusé._) The twenty-eight volumes of the Manchu code cover general,\r\ncivil, finance, military, criminal and public works law.\r\n\r\nThe following, taken from the Shanghai _Shen Pao_, of August 29 and\r\n30, 1911, the oldest and most reliable native paper of China, will\r\nillustrate the “third degree” methods used by the old literati judges\r\nof the Manchus, and incidentally the astonishing endurance of the\r\nChinese, who from time immemorial have lived outdoor lives and whose\r\nhearts have incredible powers of recovery. “The murderer, Hsu, was\r\nbrought before the assistant magistrate Chung on August 27th for a\r\nfinal trial. The magistrate ordered the clerk to read the confession\r\nof the murderer (procured by torture in the native walled city of\r\nShanghai), who said it was incorrect in one statement. The assistant\r\nmagistrate consented to the correction. When City Magistrate Tien\r\nlearned of this, he ordered Hsu to be whipped. Up to three hundred\r\nstrokes no groan escaped from Hsu. At this Tien was angered and called\r\nto the torturers to strike heavily. Hsu was now whipped so cruelly that\r\nhis flesh was cut from his back, and some muffled groans were heard.\r\nWhen five hundred strokes had been administered, he was again asked\r\nto confess or suffer pain. As he was still obstinate the magistrate\r\nordered him to receive eight hundred strokes of the bamboo. He was\r\nnow subjected to the most inhuman kind of torture, that in which the\r\nprisoner kneels on an iron chain, while two yamen runners stand upon a\r\nwooden beam laid across the back of his legs. As Hsu stood even this\r\ntorture, he was strung up by his fingers and queue on a scaffold. Hsu\r\ncried out that he would not be kicked by the runners. The magistrate\r\nwas now very angry. He ordered Hsu to be stretched upon the weighing\r\nmachine (which gradually pulls the victim apart). The man fainted,\r\nbut when he recovered he would not confess. The scaffold was again\r\nrequisitioned, and he was strung up again by fingers and queue. He\r\nstruggled and his queue of hair parted from his head. Next day, he was\r\nmade to kneel on the iron chain under two men for two hours. When he\r\nwas about to faint, the two runners picked him up and ran him about to\r\nrestore his heart action. Alternately they put him upon the chain and\r\nrestored his circulation. He then cried out: ‘Why should I sign two\r\nconfessions; I have but to die.’ He was ordered to receive four hundred\r\nstrokes of the bamboo. The magistrate Tien threatened to persecute the\r\nvictim’s wife and son. Hsu now relapsed into a fever which has been\r\nrunning two days.”\r\n\r\nThe Chinese when in a rage (chih) is not a knife-user as are the\r\nsouthern races of Europe, but a hair or queue-puller. Now that the\r\nqueue is being severed in China, he will probably take to kicking or\r\nboxing, in the French and Anglo-Saxon methods, in expressing his temper.\r\n\r\nThe social adjuster, or peace-talker, is a well-known institution, more\r\ngenerally employed within the hsiang (village) and guild, than the\r\nlaw. “To go to law is to put one’s estate in the ditch and one’s soul\r\nin hell,” is one of their sayings. Therefore, the importance of first\r\nengaging the services of the adjuster, or second, to meet the second\r\nof the offender, rather than to enter suit, and get into the hands of\r\nlawyers, court runners, grasping judges, etc. This heathen adjuster\r\nanswers to the work that the lay deacon may have done in the early\r\nChristian church, in settling cases out of court. It is an institution\r\nthat might well be copied from China in these days of criticism of\r\nthe bench and bar by such authorities as Ex-presidents Roosevelt and\r\nTaft, and Mr. Bryan. The Chinese adjuster puts the case before, and\r\nsettles it in accord with, public opinion, without any idea of fee;\r\nand certainly public opinion is a better judge than the law whose\r\njustice is built too much on fees, appeals and the maintenance of a\r\nlarge set of pettifoggers who live on the woes and ill temper of the\r\nunfortunate. In the revision of the Chinese code by Wu Ting Fang, Wang\r\nChung Wei (educated at Yale), etc., long life to the social adjuster,\r\nthe village Solon, whose ways are ways of peace, but whose path is not\r\none of pleasantness! We have said that authorities have castigated the\r\nbar in China and America. Here is what Cicero said of Rome (the mother\r\nof laws) in the “Murena” oration: “For though many things have been\r\nsettled excellently by the laws, yet most of them have been depraved\r\nand corrupted by the talkatively litigious genius of lawyers.”\r\n\r\nThe method of “planting” forged evidence is met with in China where a\r\npowerful enemy wishes to ruin some victim. The Yuen Fung Yuen Bank, of\r\nBonham Strand, is one of the largest native banks in Hongkong, in which\r\ncolony it is illegal to import opium except through the Farm, which\r\npays the government a large royalty. This valuable drug passes almost\r\nat bullion value. Anonymous information was sent to the Farm contractor\r\nthat at 8:00 P. M. the bank would receive illicit opium. Detectives\r\nwere put in ambuscade. At the hour mentioned a coolie bearing a basket\r\nrapped at the bank’s door and shouted: “A letter for you.” Then he ran,\r\nbut was caught. An examination revealed a tin of opium at the bottom\r\nof a basket of eggs. Investigation disclosed the whole thing as a\r\n“plant” prepared by an old enemy of the Yuen Fung Bank. In the same way\r\nbodies of the dead and murdered are often secretly placed at the doors\r\nof innocent victims, and as much motive as possible is prepared so as\r\nto get them in trouble with law and popular indignation. In years now\r\nhappily passed missionaries have been bothered in this way by “Boxer”\r\nconspirators.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese code provides that all deeds shall bear the stipulation\r\nthat “the land was first offered to the seller’s kinsmen, who refused\r\nto buy.” When a deed is lost, the Mandarin can issue a duplicate deed\r\non presentation of the last tax receipt and tax receipts themselves are\r\ntransferred in place of lost deeds.\r\n\r\nIn 313 B. C. the state of Tsi (present Shangtung Province) broke up its\r\nhalf of a wooden tablet containing part of the agreement with the state\r\nof Tsu (present Hupeh Province). These halves fitted into each other,\r\nand beyond any possibility of substitution proved the genuineness\r\nof the record. An old book called the _Si Yuen_ (washing the pit),\r\nused in connection with the criminal code, prescribes the method of\r\nascertaining whether death was caused by blows or was natural. A clay\r\npit is heated white, the ashes are dug out, and wine is poured in.\r\nThe body is then placed on a cradle in the pit, and a roof of tiles is\r\nplaced over the pit’s mouth. If the fumes of the rice alcohol bring out\r\nthe marks, even on a partly decayed body, the murderer is searched for.\r\nOther books relate that if a body is thrown into the water after death,\r\nit will not show distended stomach, hair stuck to head, or foam in\r\nmouth; the hands and feet will not be stiff, or the soles of the feet\r\nwhite. Their criminologists also write that if a body is thrown into a\r\nfire after death, there will be no burning or ashes in the throat and\r\nnostrils. The Chinese of the old time were rather clever investigators\r\nof crime.\r\n\r\nThis scene was presented outside the west gate of Tientsin one\r\nOctober day in 1870 after the massacre at the French convent. The\r\nFrench compelled Li Hung Chang to give them satisfaction. Li held the\r\nexecution at dawn so that a mob might not gather. The criminals were\r\nflattered as martyrs. None of them was bound. New silk clothes, fine\r\nshoes and the ornaments of females were put upon them. Arriving at the\r\nexecution ground, they were given opium. They shouted to the crowd,\r\n“Are we showing a shamed face?” And the answer came back: “No.” “Call\r\nus brave lads for being given to the foreigners as a sacrifice,” they\r\ncried again. A shout of approval came back. Then they sang a war song,\r\nand while their relatives cried, they knelt and stretched out their\r\nown necks before the blow of the heavy, short, mercury-loaded Taifo\r\nsword of the executioner. The shedding of a cock’s blood, even in the\r\nBritish courts of Hongkong, when an oath is taken, is a survival of\r\nthe ancient Chinese custom, practised in Confucius’ day (550 B. C.),\r\nwhen the ministers of the various states of Lu, Wu, Tsin, etc., had\r\na criminal killed, and wetting their lips with his blood, took oath\r\nto keep the treaty, which was inscribed on wood, each party taking a\r\nbroken portion. The following incident will throw a flashlight on a\r\nsection of Chinese legal practise, just previous to the revolution of\r\n1911. It is well known that Wu Ting Fang, two and a half years before\r\nthe revolution, had revised and modernized the Chinese code, but it was\r\nnot even in part put in practise before the revolution. In Tungkadoo, a\r\ntown of Kiangsu province, a bonze (priest) murdered a fellow-bonze and\r\nconfessed under third-degree torture. The native authorities brought\r\nhim to Shanghai to be strangled, but the chief bonze, with headquarters\r\nat Chingkiang, requested that the criminal should be turned over to him\r\nto be burned to death according to the code of the Order. Cremation of\r\ndead bodies was more common in China when Marco Polo visited the land\r\nthan it is now, though it is practised in the Honan Island section of\r\nCanton.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that not for some years will the punishments of\r\nflogging, neck cangue and stocks be removed from the revised Chinese\r\ncode. These punishments, involving public “loss of face,” are abhorred\r\nby the Chinese, and while they are somewhat barbaric, they are\r\neffective deterrents of crime in China. They were both revived by the\r\nBritish government of Hongkong in dealing with native offenders during\r\nthe turbulent times of the 1911–12 revolution, when it was found that\r\nhard labor, jail sentences and fines were laughed at by the immense\r\nChinese population of the island colony. Greece, as long ago as 330\r\nB. C., had borrowed the cangue from China, and Demosthenes, in the\r\n_Oration On the Crown_, can think of no way so effective to damage his\r\naccuser, Aeschines, than to mention that the latter’s father had to\r\nwear a zulon (cangue) as a punishment for thievery. Chien Shao Cheng,\r\nof the Justice Department, Peking, has visited American prisons and\r\nstudied foreign penal methods.\r\n\r\nAn “Investigating and Arresting Department” is the name by which one\r\nof the Manchu courts at Canton went. It employed detectives, and the\r\ntaotai (mayor) did not disguise the fact that the court resorted to\r\n“third degree” tortures. This was one of the many things which made\r\nfollowers for the reformers. Banishment cases are constantly coming\r\nup. The prisoner who will not or can not depart to another country or\r\nprovince is put in the stocks for four hours a day for a year, and the\r\nremainder of the day he spends at hard labor. Strangling in cages was\r\nin vogue at Canton in the last days of the Manchu reign, orders having\r\ncome from Peking in September, 1911, that the coolie who attempted to\r\nassassinate Admiral Li should be suspended by the neck in a bottomless\r\ncage. In the yamen at Chingtu City stands a stone tablet bearing the\r\nword Sha (kill), erected by the Shansi marauder, Chang Hien Chung, who\r\nmassacred the Szechuenese, who supported the native Ming emperors. The\r\nstone remained as a threat to be used by the Manchu mandarins on behalf\r\nof the Ta Ching dynasty. The Ministry of Justice under the Manchu\r\nrégime ordered the viceroys and governors to prohibit foreigners from\r\nunnecessarily being present in court.\r\n\r\nOn account of the scarcity of foreign population, the Hongkong jury\r\nconsists of seven and the Shanghai jury of five. There is constant\r\nargument between the Chinese press and the English press of the treaty\r\nports in China on the subject of “mixed” courts in which foreigners\r\nsit. China is writing a reformed code in which Wu Ting Fang had a hand,\r\nand in which the new minister, Wong Chun Hui, is interested, and is\r\npressing forward to the day when at least she will try all Chinese,\r\nincluding those who have injured foreigners in settlements. The\r\nnewspaper argument will do good instead of harm. In 1899 Japan ceased\r\nto allow her citizens to be tried under foreign law, and even began\r\nto try foreigners under Japanese law. On the subject of trusts and\r\ndirectorial responsibility, I have seen in the Tientsin _Ching Wei Pao_\r\na plea that employés be not fined and imprisoned for corporate faults,\r\nbut that those who make the money (directors and shareholders) bear the\r\nresponsibility. China is, and has always been, a frank sociological\r\nthinker.\r\n\r\nA police system on the French gendarmerie plan has been put in vogue at\r\nPeking, and photographs are being generally used for identification.\r\nThe Chinese have been very averse to photographs. The custom was\r\nbroken down by Hongkong insisting for twenty years that emigrants\r\nshould be photographed in duplicate so that their certificates might\r\nbe identified. This gradually got the Chinese used to the custom, the\r\nreturned emigrants spreading word that there was no ill-luck in the\r\noperation. The old-fashioned policeman who went his rounds beating a\r\ngong is becoming obsolete, and the new policeman, like our own, is\r\nsupposed to bait himself with silence and skill, so as to be sugar\r\nin leading the burglar to the trap. Not long ago, however, I heard\r\nthe old-fashioned Chinese Lukong beating his wooden drum as he went\r\nhis rounds in the Portuguese colony of Macao, China. When the police\r\nrecover lost goods, half only is returned to the owner, and half often\r\ngoes to public charity which is organized in a guild. This is an old\r\nregulation in many parts of China. One of their wits said that the\r\ndifference between a lower and a higher court is that one has the first\r\nand the other has the last “guess” at a case! The Chinese point out\r\nthe delays in the execution of murderers as a most serious defect in\r\njustice, and the sentimentalism expressed by part of our press and\r\npulpit as a most serious defect in our mentality. They show headings\r\nin our newspapers reading as follows: “Ministers Strive with Murderer\r\nBlank”; “Four Pastors Prepare Murderer Blank for Death,” etc. The\r\nlaconic Chinese ask: “How long a time did the murderer give his victim\r\nto prepare for death.” The Chinese say that our levity in this terrific\r\nmatter has run the average of murders in America up to the highest\r\npoint in any nation, and that their average, with England’s, is the\r\nlowest because of swift and sure justice in those two countries.\r\n\r\nIn our month of August occurs the festival of the goddess of\r\nneedlework. It is customary for the women to exhibit the wealth and\r\nornaments of the family during this festival. In 1911, at Fatshan,\r\nnear Canton, where Sunyacius was born, robbers disguised as women\r\narrived in closed chairs before the yamen (compound) of the Li family,\r\nand pretending to be relatives, they broke past the doormen. When\r\ninside the home, they drew weapons, and with the inmates intimidated,\r\nransacked the house of jewels and valuables, escaping to the river,\r\nwhere the pirate boats took them on board and made off for the\r\nreaches and canals. Owing to the paucity of maritime police, because\r\nof a limited revenue, piracy has swept over China’s waters since her\r\nCaptain Kidd, Koxinga, operated from Amoy in 1657. The West River of\r\nKwangtung province has been notorious in recent years, and in my former\r\nbook, _The Chinese_, I have related the attacks upon Europeans in the\r\nsteamers _Sainam_ and _Shui On_.\r\n\r\nThe most startling attack in many years was upon the well-known\r\nPacific Mail steamer _Asia_, in April, 1911. Known previously as the\r\n_Coptic_, this steamer sailed from San Francisco for twenty years in\r\nthe trans-Pacific service, and she was therefore well known to many\r\nthousands of Americans. She was a graceful Belfast-built boat of low\r\nfreeboard, and easily boarded. In a fog on April 23rd she ran against\r\nthe precipitous Finger Rock Island, which rises off the coast of\r\nChekiang province. Wireless was immediately sent out, and the Chinese\r\nMerchants’ S. S. Company’s vessel _Shoa Shing_ started for the rescue.\r\nBefore she could arrive and after her departure with the sixty rescued\r\npassengers, Chekiang pirates, in swift snake boats and sanpans, put\r\noff to the attack, and despite revolver defense, boarded the _Asia_\r\nand her boats. They even demanded under duress that passengers should\r\nsign “chits,” promising to pay sums of money for rescue. When the\r\nsteamer was temporarily abandoned, they boarded and stripped her of\r\nalmost everything except the smokestack paint. Fisherman and pirate\r\nare about as synonymous on some waters of China as Cornishman and\r\nfarmer, Panamanian and placer miner are in some of our romantic novels!\r\nThrilling engagements with pirates not infrequently occur almost\r\nunder the windows of the fashionable Boa Vista and Hing Kee Hotels on\r\nromantic Macao’s Praya Granda.\r\n\r\nOn July 13, 1910, a party of Chinese students, women and children were\r\nkidnapped in Macao, by pirates led by the second of the swashbuckler\r\nLeungs, and by the leader Luk, and taken to Ko-Ho (Colowan) Island,\r\nwhere they were chained to the walls of caves and of a Portuguese\r\nfort, after the latter had been stormed, and the blue and white flag\r\nof the castles hauled down to be succeeded by the triangular red flag\r\nof the pirates. The governor of Macao sent the Portuguese gunboats\r\n_Patria_ and _Macao_, and an expedition of artillery and infantry of\r\nthe “Legionaries Coloniale.” The possession of this island by the\r\nPortuguese has long been disputed by China, and the Chinese gunboats,\r\nwhich now drew up only watched the engagement. Two thousand pirates\r\nfought with modern weapons and smokeless powder, which had been\r\nsmuggled from Japan. The Portuguese bombarded with four-inch guns, and\r\ndropped so many shells into so many compartments of two pirate junks,\r\nas with skull and sail they made for rocky Wung Kum Island, that they\r\nsank with all on board. In an armistice, Commander Wu, of the Chinese\r\nnavy, a brave commander of whom we shall hear more, disguised as a\r\ncoolie, courageously spied on the pirates’ stronghold and ascertained\r\nwhere most of the women were imprisoned, so as to save these retreats\r\nfrom being bombarded. The pirates were smoked out of these caves with\r\nsulphur and the women resuscitated.\r\n\r\nNot only South China, but North China also has experienced piratical\r\nattacks in recent times. In September, 1910, a large band of Hung-Hutz\r\npirates, disguised as bean merchants, sailed down the Liao River to\r\nNewchwang and captured for ransom fifteen wealthy Chinese merchants\r\nunder the walls of the foreign settlements. They safely made retreat\r\nwith captured arms to their mountain stronghold, one hundred miles up\r\nthe river, near Liaoyang, and settled down for a siege. The Chinese\r\ndesire to build more railways through this section, but the Japanese\r\nand Russians have opposed American backing of another road and have\r\nhoodwinked Britain and Europe into a disinterested attitude, which is\r\nthe _status quo_, but not the permanent settlement of the question.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese have a saying regarding courts, retainers and the animals\r\noutside, as follows: “When the mandarin swears, the dogs bark, and when\r\nthe mandarin laughs the dogs grin, and the terrible tsai ren (yamen\r\ncourt runners, corresponding to our detectives) stroke their rough\r\nfingers.” Some of their legal proverbs are:\r\n\r\n“When two rascals differ, the truth is near; when they agree, the truth\r\nis hid.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t jump to conclusions in evidence, for a grain of sand is not the\r\nseashore, nor a tree a forest.”\r\n\r\n“It is hard to rise, but easy to fall.”\r\n\r\n“No one would believe a blind man who tried to tell a ghost story.”\r\n\r\n“It’s easier to twist the road than the mountain.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nCHINESE DAILY LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe happy Leigh Hunt, who was half American by blood, in one of his\r\nincomparable Addisonian essays, _Tea Drinking_, wrote as follows of\r\nthe daily life and surroundings of the Chinese: “The very word tea,\r\nso petty, so infantine, so winking-eyed, so expressive, somehow or\r\nother, of something inexpressibly minute and satisfied with a little\r\n(tee!) resembles the idea one has (perhaps a very mistaken one) of that\r\nextraordinary people of whom Europeans know little or nothing, except\r\nthat they sell us this preparation, bow back again our ambassadors,\r\nhave a language consisting of only a few hundred words, gave us\r\nchinaware and the strange pictures on our teacups, made a certain\r\nprogress in civilization long before we did, mysteriously stopped at it\r\nand would go no further, and if numbers and the customs of venerable\r\nancestors are to carry the day, are at once the most populous and the\r\nmost respectable nation on the face of the earth. As a population they\r\ncertainly are a most enormous and wonderful body, but as individuals,\r\ntheir ceremonies, their trifling edicts, their jealousy of foreigners,\r\nand their teacup representations of themselves impress us irresistibly\r\nwith a fancy that they are a people all toddling, little-eyed,\r\nlittle-footed, little-bearded, little-minded, quaint, overweening,\r\npig-tailed, bald-headed, cone-capped or pagoda-hatted, having childish\r\nhouses and temples with bells at every corner and story, and shuffling\r\nabout in blue landscapes, over nine-inch bridges, with little mysteries\r\nof bell-hung whips in their hands,--a boat or a house or a tree, made\r\nof a pattern, being over their heads or underneath them, and a bird\r\nas large as the boat, always having a circular white space to fly in!\r\nSuch are the Chinese of the teacups and the grocers’ windows, and\r\npartly of their own novels, too, in which everything seems as little\r\nas their eyes, little odes, little wine parties and a series of little\r\nsatisfactions. However, it must be owned that from these novels one\r\ngradually acquires a notion that there is a great deal more good sense\r\nand even good poetry among them than one had fancied from the accounts\r\nof embassies and the autobiographical paintings on the chinaware, and\r\nthis is the most probable supposition. An ancient and great nation as\r\ncivilized as they is not likely to be so much behind hand with us in\r\nthe art of living as our self-complacency leads us to imagine. If their\r\ncontempt of us amounts to the barbarous, perhaps there is a greater\r\nshare of barbarism than we suspect in our scorn of them.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright, 1913, The Bobbs-Merrill Company.\r\n\r\nBuddhist temples, now used as schools.

A beggar crouches at the\r\n    roadside.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn August the Chinese resort to the graveyards and burn paper money and\r\ntin- and gold-foil models at the graves of their ancestors. It is a\r\npretty sight at night to see thousands of these little fires lighting\r\nup the vast fields of the dead like a plain of stars through which\r\nthe living spirits move. The ceremonies sometimes include the Greek\r\ncustom of pouring out a libation of wine, and as this is the custom\r\nespecially in the western provinces, it may indicate a former communion\r\nwith old Greece. Long before the Christian era Greece had possibly\r\nacquired veneration for graves from older China. Demosthenes cried out\r\nto the Athenians in B. C. 354 as a climax to his arguments: “Will ye\r\nsacrifice your sepulchres to the Persian?” A mortuary custom in the\r\nsouthwest provinces, also similar to the Greek, is to place a coin\r\nin the mouth, to pay for ferriage of the spirit. The round coin, made\r\nof jade, and sometimes banded with pure gold, is an exact copy of the\r\ncopper cash, with a square hole in the center. These tomb jades acquire\r\na stained appearance as compared with the delightful glisten of jades\r\nkept in the light.\r\n\r\nForeigners with cinematograph lanterns are now going into the interior\r\nof China with interpreters to manage part of their shows, and are doing\r\nwell, as the Chinese delight in the moving pictures. It is necessary to\r\napply to the provincial governor for a passport, and to register at the\r\nconsulate at the nearest treaty port. Both French and American films\r\nare used.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the long nails, dwarfed feet and heavy hairdressing\r\nis the snobbish one of showing that such a person does not need to\r\nwork, but can afford to keep servants. These devotees of fashion,\r\nrapidly becoming fewer, suffer so much torture that their conceit\r\ncan be forgiven them. “Don’t say a word, you Westerners; remember\r\nyour suffocating waists and your high-heeled compressed shoes,”\r\nretort some of the Chinese! At Ningpo boys wear boots made of human\r\nhair. Over these they draw straw sandals. For waterproof material an\r\noiled cotton is used. The very poor classes use a picturesque cape\r\nand kilt made of rush leaves, and one sees sights on the mountain\r\nroads of Hongkong that remind one of Robinson Crusoe and Friday. The\r\nChinese are great bird fanciers. Crows, magpies, hawks, larks, ducks,\r\nfinches, etc., are exposed for sale in the fairs. The singing birds\r\nare taught to sing in competition, and also to catch seeds thrown into\r\nthe air. Fortune-tellers take up their location at the street corner\r\nin Hongkong, Canton, and other ports, with their trained Kwangtung\r\nsparrows. When you pay your coin, the owner places a package of cards\r\nin envelopes before the door of the cage. The bird selects one and is\r\nrewarded with a grain of rice. You identify the card by the picture\r\nthat it bears. The owner puts the card, together with a tiny slip of\r\nsandalwood, back in the envelope, shuffles the envelopes and calls the\r\nbird out again. The bird will select the same envelope, which proves\r\nthat Kwangtung sparrows at least have a fine sense of smell! On another\r\ncorner stands a bird trainer with a grossbeak-weaver perched upon his\r\nfinger. He throws coins into the air, toward which the bird darts,\r\ncatching the coins in its bill and returning to the finger of the\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nOn the narrow streets, in constant danger of being jostled into, the\r\nletter-writer sits at a table, painting the beautiful characters for\r\nwhomsoever wishes to buy a letter. His customers are many,--fruiterers,\r\nlaborers, fishermen, cooks, gunny-lifters, hotel-runners, lantern\r\nsellers, rice bird hawkers, etc. The Buddhist or Taoist priest, too, is\r\nnot averse to writing a letter for a wife buyer for an added fee after\r\nhis customer has bought a written prayer to Buddha or his own dead\r\nfather, which prayer the priest burns in presenting it to the spirit.\r\n\r\nThere are many Mohammedan Chinese in the western and southwestern\r\nprovinces, and scattered throughout the empire are Mohammedan\r\ncompanies. They are generally butchers and bakers by occupation. Among\r\nthese Mohammedans are doubtless the lost colonies of Chinese Jews.\r\n\r\nIt is found that the Miao aborigines of Szechuen and Yunnan are a more\r\nimpulsive, vivacious, and by turns a more sulky race than the staid,\r\ntrim, mannerly Chinese. Missionaries, therefore, report that when they\r\nChristianize the aborigines they find them delightfully frank and\r\nvivacious companions, who grow to be liked heartily, as the cultured\r\nChinese is in comparison deeply respected. The Miaos (Now Su tribe)\r\nshow Burmese influence, too, for they burn their dead, a custom which\r\nis abhorred by the Chinese masses, though some Buddhist priests do it.\r\nThe Miaos often worship a hill, and far to the east, even at Hongkong,\r\nI have seen members of the aboriginal Hakka tribes worshiping a hill,\r\nor a rock, or the seashore. On the hillsides of Hongkong jars will be\r\nfound on stones among the woods. These contain the bones of Hongkong\r\nChinese who have died in America and whose bones lie out in the woods,\r\nwaiting till the Taoist calendar reports that it is a lucky day for\r\nburial. If you make the fee large enough the priest can grant you\r\nabsolution any day and you may bury with full assurance of good luck.\r\nIt then becomes a struggle between the priest’s determination and the\r\nmourner’s stubbornness in the matter of securing possession of the\r\ncoins of the dead one! The body lies in an American graveyard until\r\nthe large bones only remain. These are manifested across the Pacific\r\nas “fish bones” and are received at Hongkong by the Tung Wah Hospital\r\nfor the guild of which deceased was a member. The hospital turns the\r\nbones over to the chief mourner, who places them in a jar, as already\r\nrelated. While the Chinese abhor sickness, and will sometimes desert a\r\nfever patient after loading his blanket with stones so that he can not\r\nleave the bed, they have no abhorrence of coffins or bones. For long\r\nperiods they keep the coffin in the best room of the house, or the jar\r\nof bones in the garden.\r\n\r\nIn selling goods by auction at the pawnshops, or inns, the auctioneer\r\ndoes not permit audible bidding. The goods are passed through an\r\nopening for inspection. Then the bidders walk to the window, and\r\nby whisper, card, or squeeze of the hand, indicate the bid. This\r\nencourages high instead of low bidding at the beginning, for it is\r\nknown that the first bidder who offers a fair price secures the\r\narticle.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese, on account of their localization, and lack of experience,\r\nwhile usually placid, can be worked up into uncontrollable excitement.\r\nThis explains the murders of missionaries by mobs in the long years\r\nup to 1901. Many suicides among officials and widows and daughters of\r\nsoldiers followed the excitement and distress of the October, 1911,\r\nrevolution. The camaraderie of American clubs which has evolved the\r\ngreeting, “old fellow,” equal to the “old chap” of British clubs, was\r\ncopied from China, where you must call every one “old man” (lao jen).\r\nIt is the highest term of respect, is in diplomatic use, and even\r\nbonzes and teachers are addressed in that way. A captain of a sanpan\r\nis called the “great old one” (lao ta). The mayor is called “old man\r\nof the village” (hsiang lao). The following incident will illustrate\r\nhow the clan dominates Chinese life. San Wui is a city lying near\r\nCanton. The Kwan family is one of the largest and wealthiest clans\r\nliving there. It maintained near the district burial ground a fine,\r\nlarge ancestral hall filled with family tablets and effigies. Against\r\nthe votes of the clan, in the middle of August, 1911, Kwan Ta, one\r\nof the most powerful members, rented the building to the police, who\r\nused it as headquarters in collecting unpopular taxes and pressing\r\nthe people to accept the nationalization of railways scheme. The\r\npeople led by the Kwan clan, burned the ancestral temple. The members\r\nof the clan then rebuilt the hall and ordered the sculptors to make\r\nan image of the unpopular Kwan Ta, who had died in the meantime. The\r\ngranite image represents the man with his hands behind his back in a\r\nkneeling posture. On his back is carved the history of his defection.\r\nAs each member of the Kwan clan comes into the temple on the great\r\ndays to worship the ancestral tablets which have been restored, it is\r\nobligatory that he shall give Kwan Ta’s image three strokes of the\r\nbamboo!\r\n\r\nThe method of carrying water in India and China is conspicuously\r\ndifferent. In India the drawers go from the well with the jar of water\r\nbalanced on their heads. In China the water is put into two large\r\nbuckets, which are slung from the two ends of a bamboo, which is\r\nbalanced on the shoulder. Chinese markets in the villages and smaller\r\ncities are managed on the fair system, as in Russia. You can not buy\r\nbarrow wheels at the bridge fair every day in the week, because the\r\nwheelwright only comes to your village fair every second Friday,\r\nhis tour taking him through ten villages perhaps. You can not buy\r\nfeather dusters or shoes every day, as the pedler is off on a tour of\r\nsix villages, and only visits your fair, held at the temple, every\r\nSaturday. But food and coins you can buy every morning at your two\r\nvillage fairs, and the hucksters there will tell you just what days the\r\nbarber, the druggist, the potter, the copper hammerer, etc., will be\r\naround again, unless thieves waylay them, or gamblers entice them, or\r\nTaoist astrologers, looking for a bribe, deceive them into belief that\r\nit is their unlucky day by their birth star on the almanac!\r\n\r\nThat the Chinese civilization in general had little communication with\r\nEgypt or Babylonia, after once being separated, may be inferred partly\r\nfrom the fact that the early Chinese forgot the secret of embalming the\r\nbody. The _Bamboo Books_, tenth century B. C. recite how the Emperor\r\nMuh, whose concubine died while traveling with him in the Tartary\r\ndesert, had to bury her there at once, and other records recite that\r\nwhen tombs were opened they stank so badly that dogs had first to be\r\nsent in to ascertain when human beings could safely enter. It was not\r\nuntil long centuries after this that the Chinese learned to use lime\r\nto destroy the flesh.\r\n\r\nConjuring has been popular from the earliest times. The famous _Bamboo\r\nBooks_ recite that the Emperor Muh, on his travels into Tartary in the\r\ntenth century B. C., was infatuated by an unusually clever conjurer\r\nthere. Lieh Tsz, a patriotic chronicler of the fifth century B. C.,\r\ncomplains that the emperor of disintegrating China had more time to\r\nstudy the tricks of a conjurer than for state affairs.\r\n\r\nAn interesting means of transportation over the mountains of the north\r\nis the pony-litter, which is swung between two animals in tandem. The\r\ntrip is exciting enough, especially when one of the animals falls to\r\nits knees. Chinese gang laborers do all their pulling, pushing and\r\nlifting, accompanied by a chantey song. The famous trackers of the\r\nYangtze gorges and the Grand Canal; the gunny lifters of Hongkong; the\r\nwood sawers and teak pilers; the coal passers of Hankau, all sing at\r\nthe top of their splendid voices as they work.\r\n\r\nWhen a native moves he is supposed to carry fire from his old kitchen\r\nto the new one, so as not to rekindle the misfortunes of the last\r\nlessee. He desires to burn up his old predecessor’s past, which may\r\nhave been all bad (or he would not have moved), and to continue his\r\nown fortune, which is all good, or ought to be! When moving into a new\r\nhouse, the tenant replaces a threshold, lintel or rafter so that he may\r\nnot inherit the bad fortune of the former tenant. He starts all things\r\nanew, as the new piece of lumber or stone typifies. The old-fashioned\r\nChinese hotel buildings in the northern provinces are not unlike those\r\nin Palestine, low buildings with few windows in the walls being built\r\naround a court. In the court are troughs for the donkeys, mules,\r\nMongolian ponies and especially camels of the pack trains. The roofs\r\nof the buildings, with their up-curling eaves and pagoda pinnacles,\r\nare the most beautiful in the world. It seems uncanny to see a crowd\r\npassing your house on a holiday without a sound, because the Chinese\r\nshoe is all felt. In contrast with this, compare the noisy shuffling\r\nof the wooden shoes of Japan, where one man makes more noise than a\r\nthousand Chinese, or a dozen Occidentals.\r\n\r\nThe happiness of a Chinese home is measured by the degree in which\r\none’s neighbors leave one alone, not by the degree one is bothered\r\nwith the repeated visits of neighbors, as is the fashion in the\r\nmore intrusive Occident. The Chinese illustrate this characteristic\r\nby building a high wall around the clustered buildings of the\r\nhome-compound. As a rule, the Chinese rent not; they move not. They\r\nbuild a time-bronzed, indestructible home, even if it be as simple as\r\none rough rock laid across two age-silvered boulders. Generations,\r\ndown the ages, flow and follow there, as wave follows wave down the\r\nsteps of the waterfall. What is the result? A personal fame, heroism\r\nof faith, a love, a depth, a beauty, in none of which our Western life\r\ncan offer an equal joy or strength. The Oriental, never having dropped\r\nthe extinguished lamp of memory from his hand, is able to follow the\r\npath of history with intensity, satisfaction and certainty, while we\r\nof the West, having no similar assurance, wander the fields of the\r\nearth, unsatisfied still, where our individual name may be carved\r\nwith permanence. What hate pursues us? What fate awaits us? It is the\r\nsaddest sign in our psychological organization. If we intend to remain\r\ngreat, we must end this _renting_ of scooped holes in cave apartments,\r\nscatter our big cities into smaller ones, spread out on the land and\r\ngive every man a home of his own, and a strong enough one to leave\r\nthrough the ages to his great-grandson. This is the Chinese way; it\r\nis the only true way, as witness their six thousand years of certain\r\nhistory, while they take care to-day of four times our population. The\r\ncustom of sheltering the families of sons and grandsons within one\r\npatriarchal compound is truly Asian. It is described by Homer in the\r\nsixth book of _The Iliad_ as obtaining in the home of Priam, King of\r\nTroy, B. C. 2500. At New-year time, in Fukien province, all the family\r\njoin hands around a brazier which is smoking on a table, to signify the\r\nunity of the family around a common hearth.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese make a stew of chicken, ginger, lettuce and cucumbers, or\r\nvegetable marrow, and it is very good. Beans are soaked in water and\r\nallowed to sprout before being pickled, or boiled in sugar. Salutes\r\nat feasts are sometimes made in the German fashion by raising the\r\nwine (samshu) cup to the eyes before drinking. The Chinese mix rice,\r\nnuts, flour, fruit and seed in their candies, and their cakes are\r\nhighly colored and made very sweet. Where the Germans use vinegar and\r\nsalt as a preservative, the Chinese use sugar, and the results, while\r\nsurprising, are often delightful. Partly as revealing the sumptuous\r\ntable which it is now possible to set at Hongkong or Shanghai, or\r\nTientsin, and partly to show to what gastronomic heights the treaty\r\nport Chinese rise, I quote the menu of the Wah On Kwong Association, or\r\nGuild, served at one of the Hongkong hotels by Chinese stewards:\r\n\r\n             Queen olives                 Caviare on toast\r\n     Bird’s Nest soup          Chicken soup             Fungus soup\r\n           Garoupa, shrimp sauce           Boiled shark steak\r\n                   Fillet of beef (Champignon sauce)\r\n           Chicken compote                Stewed sharks’ fins\r\n     Pigeon gelatine                     Pâté de foie gras en Aspic\r\n             Beche de Mer                Fried frogs’ legs\r\n              Roast saddle of Queensland mutton with jelly\r\n                Roast ribs of sirloin of Queensland beef\r\n             Roast Kwangtung turkey            Boiled fowl\r\n     Singapore pine apple      Hankau ham                  Potatoes\r\n                   Peas    Vegetable marrow    Salad\r\n                       Asparagus, olive oil sauce\r\n                 Victoria pudding      Chartreuse jelly\r\n                      Cakes        Mango ice cream\r\n     Preserved ginger        Small oranges             Chinese nuts\r\n                   Coffee              European wines\r\n     Lucien Rozet       Cliquot      Heidsieck       Chateau Larose\r\n                    Medoc      Manzanilla    Marsala\r\n\r\nThe iron pans that come from Shansi province are made as thin as\r\npossible so as to economize fuel; indeed, as light fuel as grass and\r\nstalks is used. The kitchen god is Chang Kung, and he was given this\r\noffice because “nine generations peacefully inhabited the same compound\r\nwhen he lived on earth.” As pigs, ducks and geese are driven long\r\ndistances to market, little straw sandals are woven for their feet.\r\nThis one sometimes sees in Southern France when the frugal peasant is\r\ncompeting with local railway rates!\r\n\r\nAn official asked a mannerly subordinate which way he was walking\r\nhome, and the latter replied: “Your way, sir.” The same official,\r\ndiscussing a subject said to the subordinate: “Say what you think.” The\r\nsubordinate, who was a good party politician even in China, replied: “I\r\nthink what you say.” Some of their proverbs on daily life are:\r\n\r\n“Wine will not drown sorrow.”\r\n\r\n“The flattering tongue wants to fill its pocket.”\r\n\r\n“The pot is as strong as its thinnest spot; the chain is as strong as\r\nits weakest ring.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t ask your thirsty visitor if he will have tea, because if he is\r\nmannerly he will say, ‘Don’t trouble yourself’; just draw the tea for\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“It’s always the good climber that falls from the top of the tree.”\r\n\r\n“Those best find to-day who plan each to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow’s always harder before you get to it.”\r\n\r\n“A word is fleeter than a gale.”\r\n\r\n“The widest field has some one listening at the edge.”\r\n\r\n“A grape well chewed is better than a sweet potato swallowed whole.”\r\n\r\n“Room in the heart makes room in the house.”\r\n\r\n“Because you feel merry, there’s no need to dance when you are on a\r\nhorse’s back or in a small boat.”\r\n\r\n“Sacrifice one sheep to capture the tiger and save the other sheep.”\r\n\r\n“Even honey is not sweet at the end of the meal.”\r\n\r\n“A fat cat never got all his food at home.”\r\n\r\n“Tightening your drumhead is as good as enlarging your stick.”\r\n\r\n“A blind fox catches only a dead fowl.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\nCLIMATE, DISEASE AND HYGIENE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last two years China has surprised the world by carrying out\r\nher agreement to extirpate quickly opium smoking and poppy growing.\r\nIt is the most spectacular abatement of a gigantic nuisance that the\r\nworld has known. Among the heroes of the reform was Lin Ping Chang, a\r\ngrandson of the famous Commissioner Lin who destroyed the chests of\r\nopium at Canton and brought on the war with Britain in 1840. Heredity\r\nobtains in China! It would have taken England and America possibly\r\nfifty years to bring about an equal reform in personal habits, but\r\nthe Chinese have for 3,500 years been the most obedient people to\r\ngovernment in the world, “Filial Piety” being the eminent principle of\r\nthe religious, social and political life. The good work is going on\r\napace, and Hongkong and India, thanks to the noble altruism of Lord\r\nMorley, Sir E. Grey, Mr. Asquith and Lloyd George, are with good grace\r\nswallowing the bitter pill of loss of revenue from this lucrative\r\ntrade. It was a great victory for religion over commerce, and the\r\nlatter died hard, for unregulated commerce is anything but a moralist\r\nat heart. The humanitarian sentiment in Britain, America and China won\r\nover money. Britain in her parliament _Blue Books_ used to say: “Opium\r\nis a legitimate article of trade and a vested right that China is\r\nunable to attack.” To-day John Morley speaks of Britain’s “humanitarian\r\nduty.” Persian opium, which is much denser in morphia than is the\r\nIndian, still comes to Hongkong for Formosa. This is the opium of which\r\nHerodotus in 430 B. C. amusingly wrote as follows, his imagination\r\nsupplying his facts: “Though it comes from a most stinking place, it is\r\nitself most fragrant. It is found sticking like gum to the beards of\r\nhe-goats, which collect it from the woods.”\r\n\r\nNow Japan should obey the humanitarian sentiment of the world, and\r\nstamp out opium in her Formosan colony. The opium conferences at\r\nShanghai in 1909 and the Hague in 1911, called by America and presided\r\nover by the American, Bishop Brent, have produced wonderful results.\r\nIt now remains for the western nations to emulate China’s example and\r\nstamp out morphia. China could well come back at America and say: “What\r\nare _you_ going to do about morphine and hypodermic syringes? You\r\nimport yearly 500,000 pounds of opium, and you use only 70,000 pounds\r\nin medicine. As far as morphine goes you are more ‘doped’ than all\r\nthe nations combined. You import 200,000 ounces of cocaine each year,\r\nof which only 15,000 ounces are used in medicine.” The exportation of\r\nIndia opium will cease in 1918, and China will have ceased to grow the\r\npoppy this year. In the heat of the debates in England, Eric Lewis, a\r\nWelsh supporter of Lloyd George’s, proposed that England should buy\r\nall the opium in India, like the famous Chinese Commissioner Lin of\r\nCanton, dump it in the sea, and indemnify by a loan of $40,000,000 the\r\npoppy growers of Bengal. Now let us cease to criticize Britain, for if\r\nshe grossly sinned, she has repented and made amends, as could now be\r\nexpected of a Britain which has recently established national pensions\r\nfor her aged, and brought her educational extension, employers’\r\nliability and land taxation up to the mark set by America.\r\n\r\nSo thoroughly successful was the Chinese government in restricting the\r\nplanting of the poppy even in distant Yunnan province, that in 1911 the\r\npassenger earnings of the new French railway from Haiphong to Yunnan\r\nwere greater, because men fed on maize, instead of diseased by opium,\r\nare both strong and wealthy enough to travel. Maize succeeded the\r\npoppy. When China was attacking the use of opium in the mandarinate,\r\none official wrote to the Board of Constitutional Reform: “His Majesty\r\ncan send me the silver cord (for suicide by strangulation) but I _can\r\nnot_ give up opium.” They did give it up, for an opium smoker was\r\ndenied his right to plead in court, and his office was taken from him.\r\nAt plowing time, revenue officers were sent into Yunnan, Szechuen and\r\nother poppy provinces, to see that poppy seed was not sown. The opium\r\ncure, which is either swallowed or administered hypodermically, is\r\ngiven the patient at the same time the drug is, and if his stomach only\r\nwas concerned, he is so nauseated that in five days he will give up the\r\nindulgence. The cure contains fifteen per cent. tincture belladona,\r\nfluid extract of prickly ash (xanthoxylum), and fluid extract of\r\nhyoscyamus. Another cure includes iron, coffee, quinine, strychnine,\r\ngentian and capsicum, with temporary injections of morphine in cases\r\nof collapse. In a former book, _The Chinese_, I affirmed that China\r\nand India could soon economically recover from the prohibition of\r\nopium planting if the same attention were directed to other fields. I\r\nshall instance Yunnan alone. In the first year of the prohibition the\r\nprovince suffered. In 1910 and 1911 the increase in silver, copper and\r\ntin mining, and maize cultivation had alone reimbursed Yunnan for all\r\nher loss of opium revenues, and a sobered people realized that they\r\nwere even then only beginning to find their energies for legitimate\r\nenrichment. The burning of pipes continues in China. In _The Chinese_\r\nI related some dramatic occurrences in Shanghai. In September, 1911,\r\nChinese gathered on the athletic field of the Tientsin Y. M. C. A. and\r\nburned 100,000 opium pipes, and at Yunnan City, under the auspices of\r\nGovernor Li Chin Hsi, a great burning was held on the parade ground of\r\nthe arsenal; the new military, the police and bands attending to add\r\néclat to the function.\r\n\r\nDoctor Buchanan, of India, has discovered that cats are immune to\r\nChina’s curse, bubonic plague, and that they can safely destroy the\r\nrats which carry the germs. But cats and dogs indulge in fleas, and\r\nthe flea is as busy in transporting the plague germ as are the rats.\r\nPoison and traps are the things to use against rats, and cats and\r\ndogs should be asked to retire, too, until China cleans herself up\r\na bit, when she can probably safely indulge in bench shows of her\r\nfamous chow and Pekingese dogs! Even the fur marmot has been asked to\r\ngo, since the pneumonic plague epidemic in Manchuria in the winter\r\nof 1910. That awful epidemic revealed a new scourge, even worse than\r\nbubonic, to the startled world. Bubonic thrives in dampness in the\r\nsouth in summer time. Pneumonic thrives in indoor winter conditions.\r\nAmerica was represented on the field by Doctor R. P. Strong, of Manila,\r\nDoctors Aspland and Stenhouse, and the medical missionaries Sinclair,\r\nGibb and Mary Ogden; Japan by Doctor Kitasato, who discovered the\r\nbubonic bacillus at Hongkong in 1894; Russia by Doctor Haffkine and\r\nDoctor Zabolothy; China by Doctor Wu Lien Teh; England by Doctor A. F.\r\nJackson, who fell a martyr, to the great grief of all China; Scotland\r\nby Doctor Ross, of Mukden. Though no victim recovers, the germ can not\r\nlive outside in dry air. The doctors and sanitary corps, inoculated\r\nwith Yersin serum, or Haffkine’s or Kitasato’s prophylactic lymph, at\r\nonce equipped themselves with masks and surtouts, and the scene was\r\none which Manzoni might have novelized. Often dying men were seen to\r\nstruggle up to the pile of bodies among which were their fathers, bow\r\nlow in filial, Confucian ancestor worship, even to pour out libations\r\nand present sacrifice, and then join the heap in a delirious death\r\nagony. Such a tragic attitude could be possible only in a land of\r\nancestor worship.\r\n\r\nKingslake, in _Eothen_, describes the quarantined city of Cairo in\r\n1835, when a thousand deaths a day occurred until the terrorized\r\npopulation hated the name death, and called it with bated breath\r\n“another accident”. I have been through similar nerve-racking\r\nexperiences in the plague centers of China, the mentioning of death\r\nand cemeteries being tabooed from polite conversation, though hundreds\r\nwere falling. Kingslake’s description is graphic. He went to the only\r\nEuropean physician in the city, and found him wrapped up, suffering\r\nfrom the plague. The heroic man prescribed for Kingslake. Later,\r\nthinking that he might have recovered, Kingslake sent his servant to\r\nask the physician to call. “Did you meet him?” The servant replied:\r\n“Yes, I met him coming out of his house,--on his bier!” In the\r\ntenth chapter of _Eothen_, Kingslake recites how the plague in 1835\r\nruthlessly struck down the brave brothers of the Franciscan monastery\r\nin holy Jerusalem. One quarantined member went on his priestly duty to\r\nthe stricken city. On his return to the pest-house, he rang a bell as a\r\nsignal that he still lived, and was carrying on the martyr’s work over\r\nthe paths that Christ himself trod. When the bell ceased ringing, a new\r\nbrother went forth to bury the martyr, and take up his duties which\r\ncould only also lead to death.\r\n\r\nIn 1720, Belsunce, the hero Bishop of Marseilles, seemed alone to\r\nbreathe pure air and handle pure food as he moved among the infected\r\nwho to the number of 50,000 dropped at his feet. Infection comes\r\nfrom indoor breathing, direct, or from sputum. Banish dirt, darkness\r\nand foul air, and both bubonics at once commit suicide or die of\r\nstarvation. The pneumonic, it will be recalled, swept from Harbin to\r\nNewchwang, and held Europe in terror that it would take the Siberian\r\ngoods train westward for St. Petersburg and Berlin. Thirty European\r\ndoctors and nurses were martyrs, most of them Russians. The Chinese\r\npermitted what they have never permitted before, the cremation of the\r\ndead, and the segregation of suspects in detention camps. At Harbin\r\nalone there were 1,200 deaths, the dead being cremated in the brick\r\nkilns. If heroic members of any legation staff should be given honors\r\nfor the Peking campaign against plague in 1911, there are 20,000\r\nveterans of Hongkong and South China who should be clothed in a coat of\r\nmedals for plague dangers they never thought of talking about, except\r\nto say with their guest Kipling that “it was all in the day’s work”. I\r\nhave seen the foreign police, soldiers, sanitary corps and volunteers\r\nof Hongkong and Canton tackle multitudinous dangers in epidemics with\r\nall the éclat of a football game, and the men of Bombay regularly\r\ndo the same thing. Because of the legations and press bureaus, the\r\nforeigner in North China, God bless him, is much better advertised than\r\nis the foreigner of South China and India. India had one Kipling; South\r\nChina is looking for hers!\r\n\r\nIn a former volume I have instanced some surprising appearances of\r\nbubonic plague in Europe. In September, 1910, a girl, her father,\r\nmother and nurse, died successively under mysterious conditions at\r\nPreston, Suffolk, England. It was later noticed that the rats in the\r\nneighborhood were dying. Examination showed that the black plague\r\nwas the cause, and the supposition is that the disease was imported\r\nin grain received from Odessa, Russia, and that the germs developed\r\nunder conditions of damp, dirt and darkness. In 1902, Odessa, Russia,\r\nreported a plague case in the house of a baker. In August, 1910, plague\r\nwas recrudescent there in the very same house, showing that the bubonic\r\nplague germs had lived eight years. The ineffective measures of the\r\nauthorities to destroy the rats caused the spread of the last-mentioned\r\nepidemic. World campaigns against rats will doubtless now occur from\r\ntime to time, as insurance companies have taken up the study of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nAbattoir and market laws calling for foreign supervision and veterinary\r\ninspection were first instituted by Hongkong, and Singapore, Shanghai,\r\nTientsin, Saigon, Manila, and Tsingtau followed in about the order\r\nnamed. Partial inspection is exercised at Canton, Hankau, Newchwang,\r\nPeking and other cities. It is one of the things China must and will\r\nsoon take hold of, for Sun Yat Sen (Sunyacius) who has done so much\r\nfor Chinese reform, is himself a modern physician and has always\r\nlived in foreign or treaty ports. In connection with this, China will\r\nimprove her cattle, which are of the wild, buffalo-humped variety,\r\nwith an excess of bone. Her Hankau and Manchurian black, as well as\r\nthe Kwangtung white, pigs are now going to Liverpool, London, Glasgow\r\nand Bremen. It is wonderful that populous China can be an exporter of\r\nmeat to Europe. It shows two things: that living in America and Europe\r\nis too high, and that return freights are too low. China centuries ago\r\ninstituted pure food laws, preceding Germany, Britain and America. They\r\ndid not go far of course, but they showed the germinative idea. The\r\nguild or manufacturer was glad to stamp biscuit or ink-stick, and the\r\nfood purveyor placed a red stamp on his dried duck, fish, or vermicelli\r\npackage, the stamp standing for purity or inferiority according to the\r\nreputation of the packer.\r\n\r\nEvery reader has sympathized with the heroic General Roberts who in\r\nhis book, _Forty-One Years in India_, tells of a sunstroke which he\r\nsuffered in the heat of the tropics. The great heat and humidity\r\nare likely to produce, certainly in those who use stimulants, drugs\r\nor much meat, anaemia or acidulation of the blood, with persistent\r\nauto-intoxication, and the resulting torture of constantly reeling\r\nunder the heat can be imagined. The Chinese are up at daylight, and\r\nmost active in the cooler part of the day. The Chinese skull, because\r\nof the lifelong habit of shaving the head under the Manchu régime,\r\ngrows thicker than the European’s skull, and the former, therefore, are\r\nbetter able to resist the equatorial sun. Herodotus pointed out that\r\nthe ancient Egyptians, for the same reason, resisted the sun better\r\nthan the Persians, who accustomed themselves to head-coverings from\r\nchildhood. The Chinese emperor and the mandarins gave their audiences\r\nat dawn. It will be recalled that Cicero, when governor of Asiatic\r\nCicilia, admitted the crowds of complainants to his popular court at\r\ndaylight, so as to use the hot midday for retirement from the heat.\r\nAt Hongkong, where, hot as it is, exercise is imperative, we used to\r\nrise at daylight and rush to the golf, tennis and riding courses for an\r\nhour’s play, and this unusual sight would induce you to say that it was\r\nnot so luxurious a colony as the sumptuous club life of the later day\r\nwould possibly make it appear to be.\r\n\r\nThe bar in an Oriental club is eloquent of the fact that you are in\r\nthe malarial East, for among the popular bottles is the one containing\r\nquinine-sulphate powder, and the veterans seem able to judge what is a\r\nproper dose to take out with a spoon to mix with their sherry as they\r\nsalute and say: “Here’s how,” or “The king.”\r\n\r\nSouth China is kind to the man who suffers from heat. Knowing that he\r\nis coolest who can throw away his flesh and move in his bare bones,\r\nshe provides a damp hot climate that reduces men to the appearance of\r\ntrained thoroughbreds! There they walk, the thinnest foreigners of the\r\nFar East, the Hongkong, Manila, Saigon, Shanghai and Canton men! They\r\nhave been boiled down almost to their backbones and skulls from March\r\nuntil November, and there being no tissue to feed, the blood can all go\r\nto building up the gray matter! Although black focuses the actinic rays\r\nof the overhead equatorial sun, and a body feels twenty degrees more\r\nof heat than when covered with white, the British courts of Hongkong\r\ninsist on the formal garb of Lincoln’s Inn, a black coat and gown. Pity\r\nthe barristers and judges of Hongkong who delve into the law and weigh\r\nout justice in the stifling atmosphere of the magnificent courts of the\r\nillustrious Crown colony. The almost naked, or duck-covered criminal,\r\nbracing up for his sentence, shows fewer beads on his perspiring brow\r\nthan do his learned accusers! “Inflexible” is not a more famous name in\r\nthe British navy than in the British legal and colonial service.\r\n\r\nThe Americans in Manila, the French in Saigon, and the republican\r\nChinese, however, are listening to the dictates of hygiene rather than\r\nto the long sonorous trump of tradition. In the American cavalry in\r\nthe tropics it is found that the imported white animals are immune to\r\nthe heat, whereas the darker breeds soon die. Southern Tibet is coming\r\nnearer to the railhead with its wonderful climate for the enervated\r\nof the whole East. India, Tonquin and China are sending on their\r\nconstruction gangs, and the day is not so far off when the veil at the\r\n8,000 feet passes, which has hid the last withheld land, will be rent\r\nin twain. The two men who have done the most to break down the forts\r\nof exclusion are Sir Francis, Colonel Younghusband, for the Indian\r\ngovernment, and the Chinese general, Chao Ehr Feng, who in 1910 also\r\nbroke up the Buddhist superstitious system by driving the Dalai Lama\r\n(their pope) for the first time into unholy foreign soil at Darjeeling.\r\nTwenty miles south of Chungking, in the sublime valley of Wen Tang, is\r\na famous hot sulphur bath cut in the rock. The flow is generous, and\r\nthe Buddhist priests have divided the bath so that men and women may\r\nuse it. They make no charge for the use of the water, but they charge\r\nfor inn service. Before many years many foreigners will resort here, as\r\nthe bathing is beautifully clean.\r\n\r\nA remarkable thing about China is the comparative absence of flies,\r\nbecause manure and refuse is so important as a fertilizer that it\r\nis immediately carried to the intensively farmed fields, which are\r\nexpected to produce two to three harvests a year. Therefore typhoid\r\nand other diseases are not as prevalent as they otherwise would be.\r\nHowever, a whisper in your ear, reader: if China lacks in flies, she\r\nabounds in “bunkies,” which is the polite name for fleas! Nature abhors\r\na vacuum and always provides for the deficiency in one field from the\r\nsurplus in another! To have real safety in a Chinese inn, one needs to\r\ngo to bed in a Peary suit, furnished with a diver’s helmet. This is\r\nnever done, however, because of the heat. Cold weather only increases\r\nthe torture, for the pauper “bunkie,” small as he is, successfully\r\nraces to the heated kang faster than the paying guest! As the Chinese\r\nmasses use no liquor, tobacco or drugs, and live an outdoor life on\r\nvegetable food mainly, their hearts are in splendid condition, and all\r\nthe hospital surgeons report remarkable recoveries when an accident has\r\nmade operations necessary. The race seems to have that old aboriginal\r\nfortitude of not fearing the knife or wincing under pain. They have\r\nno idea of the danger of infection by contact, the rich being as\r\nill-informed as the poor. Wet towels, wrung out in the same hot water,\r\nare for refreshment rubbed over the hands, face and neck of every one\r\nat a feast. A governor’s pipe is first lighted and puffed for him by a\r\nmiserable attendant, the governor merely wiping the mouthpiece dry with\r\nhis hand or long sleeve, the custom being to cut out a soiled sleeve\r\nand substitute a new sleeve so as to save the splendid garment.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese are proving themselves to be adept in dental surgery. Many\r\nChinese have graduated from the University of Pennsylvania dental\r\nschool, and they have set up in business throughout the Chinese treaty\r\nports. Others have graduated from Hongkong’s school, and still others,\r\nentering as apprentices under Chinese dentists, trained abroad, soon\r\nstart out for themselves and pass the good work along. When customers\r\nare slow in coming, the Chinese dentist adds another shingle to his\r\ndoor. “Dentist and Photographer”; “Dentist and Printer”; “Dentist\r\nand Manufacturers’ Agent,” are common signs. A good many stories are\r\nprinted that the old-fashioned Oriental dentist trained himself for\r\ntooth pulling by practising with his fingers on pulling pegs from soft\r\nand afterward from hardwood logs, but this is true only as far as\r\nloosened teeth are concerned. They always used forceps of some kind.\r\nGenerals Roberts and Kitchener could not, by taking thought, add one\r\ncubit unto the stature of the British soldier, but they decreed that\r\nhe must have as good teeth as he had a rifle when on foreign service,\r\nand so the dentists of Hongkong and other garrison ports flourish. The\r\nBritish call themselves “dental surgeons.” The Chinese put out a sign\r\nthat they repair or extract molars “by best American methods.” The\r\nPhiladelphia dentist, here as over the world, leads in his calling.\r\nOne owns a leading newspaper of Hongkong. The prices of the American\r\ndentist are high, as the tourist and five-year indentured clerk\r\ndiscover. Apprentices are brought out under contract covering service,\r\nand it is rumored that some contracts prohibit independent practise\r\nin the same port at the end of the term; but common law has long ago\r\nexploded the legality of a man signing away his rights to make a living.\r\n\r\nIt is strongly hoped that a cure has now been found for incipient\r\ntubercular leprosy, hitherto supposed to be incurable. South China\r\nhas more lepers than any country, and the necessary segregation is\r\nincomplete. Doctor J. T. Wayson, city physician of Honolulu, has used\r\nthe “beauty pencil” (stick of carbon dioxide ice), which gives a\r\ntemperature of one hundred degrees below zero, on the nodule sores,\r\nbreaking down the affected tissues time after time, until no “bacilli\r\nleprae” are found in the tests of the cuttings from the surrounding\r\nparts. He has found that affected children of lepers seem to have been\r\ncured. The trial of this method will be made in the missionary and\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania hospitals at Canton, which is the center\r\nof the largest leprous district in the world, though it has had no\r\nRobert Louis Stevenson or Father Damien eloquently to make its wants\r\nknown, as was done for the Molokai colony in Hawaii. If there is some\r\nunknown microbic diathesis or nervous tendency to it, this remedy, like\r\nquinine, strychnine, phosphate of iron, chaulmoogra oil, etc., may not\r\nbe a permanent success. Long years of observation only can tell. I\r\nhave gone through the leper camps and the leper boat colonies of the\r\nHeungshan Peninsula between Canton and Macao. The colonies do not seem\r\nto move up or down in numbers. There seems to be no danger of infection\r\nif the visitor does not eat or handle things among them.\r\n\r\nAs I have related in _The Chinese_, the scenes are piteous beyond\r\nwords, and illustrate China’s old Spartan methods, that the sooner\r\nincompetents pass away the better for all. It is said that a fish diet\r\nencourages the diathesis, and certainly Heungshan is a remarkable fish\r\ncenter. Doctor G. A. Hansen, of Bergen, a Norwegian bacteriologist, and\r\nDoctors Brinckerhoff, Cumy and Hallman, of Honolulu, all discovered\r\nthe leprosy bacillus, and Doctor Hansen broke down the belief that\r\nthe disease was hereditary. By segregation, he reduced Norway’s cases\r\nfrom three thousand to four hundred. The American bacteriologists are\r\nexperimenting on toxins. In 1902 an American named Conrardy established\r\nand lived in a model endowed lazaretto with five hundred lepers\r\nnear Canton. He, of course, contracted the disease, which made slow\r\nheadway because of his vitality, which was stronger than that of the\r\nvegetable-fed Chinese. He expected to live for fifteen years, but at\r\nthe end of eight years he was slowly sinking. On beautiful Joao Island,\r\nwhich is in view from your hotel window at Macao, South China, Portugal\r\nlong ago established a leper asylum.\r\n\r\nA careful study of the newspapers for many years must lead one to the\r\ndeduction that as the Chinese adopt foreign life in the treaty ports,\r\nsuicides are increasing among married women and business men. Probably\r\nboth religion and nerves are at fault, for they go somewhat together.\r\nAs is well known, Chinese cities and dwelling-compounds are surrounded\r\nby walls. Unusual rains or quickly melting snows often undermine the\r\nwalls of compounds, filling the street with débris. In August, 1911,\r\nat Mukden, Manchuria, particularly, the streets looked as though the\r\nRussians and Japanese had again just got through with bombarding the\r\ntown! How differently everything is done in China and the Occident! The\r\nNew Jersey cities are spending some $10,000,000 to take liquid sewage\r\nfrom their rivers and conduct it in a trunk sewer to New York Bay. In\r\nChina so little sewage remains after the farmer is through with its\r\nmanuring properties that British analysts concluded to take the water\r\nsupply for the three cities of Hankau, Hanyang and Wuchang, in the\r\ncenter of populous China, directly from the Han River near the cities.\r\nThe extensive plant consists of a deep intake protected from the heavy\r\nloess siltage; an air lift, which showers the water in rain into filter\r\nbeds; reservoirs of five million gallons; three Worthington pumps of\r\n300,000 gallons an hour and an electric plant to supply the cities. The\r\ncompany is Chinese, and Chinese did all the contracting by the favorite\r\nmethod of piecework. As the provincial parliament was not established\r\nwhen the company was chartered, the viceroy granted the franchise.\r\nAmerican boilers were used.\r\n\r\nWater gathering is easy in Hongkong, though it has no river. Many\r\nmountains of the island have been reserved and trenched at the bottom.\r\nThe torrential rains strike these peaks, and a thousand trenches\r\ncarry the water to dammed valleys at Taitam, Pokfulum and Wong Nei\r\nChong, high enough up in the hills to give gravity pressure for the\r\nmains. The beautiful aqueducts on Bowen Road, far up on the mountain\r\nside, facing the famous harbor, are a sight no tourist approaching on\r\nhis steamer will forget. When pianos are made for the humid south,\r\nloose keys and felt, fastened without gum, must be provided for, and\r\neven at that lamps are kept burning under the instrument to dry the\r\natmosphere. A case of the Korean “earth disease,” or “tochil,” is rare\r\nin America, owing to the vigilance of our Marine Hospital Service,\r\nbut one case got into Seattle from the Orient in September, 1910. The\r\ndisease is incurable and infectious, and is much dreaded. Other races\r\nmay have forgotten, but the Orient never forgets, and always can bring\r\nup something wonderful from the dispersion of Babel, and every camp\r\ngathering since, along the valley of the Tarim!\r\n\r\nAn account of the quarantine practise at Hongkong and other Oriental\r\ntropical ports may be of interest. Manila, Saigon, Singapore, Shanghai\r\nor Nagasaki may hear or believe that there is plague or cholera at\r\nHongkong, and they quarantine vessels from the latter port. There\r\nis always certain feeling between the port doctors, and Hongkong\r\nretaliates. A vessel loaded with steerage and cabin passengers arrives\r\nat Hongkong from one of these other ports. The yellow flag is hoisted\r\non the main topmast and no one is allowed to board the ship, which\r\nlies in the stream, until the port doctor and his assistants come off\r\nin a launch, which flies a yellow flag, and allows the ship’s yellow\r\nflag to be hauled down. Quartermasters man the gangway and rail until\r\nthe doctor frees the vessel. He holds a conference with the ship’s\r\ndoctor, and woe betide the latter’s vessel, or its future calls up and\r\ndown the coast, if untruths are told or concealments made. The cabin\r\npassengers are carefully watched as they march by the cabin table, and\r\nthe temperature of suspicious cases is taken. Any one who shows over\r\nninety-nine degrees Fahrenheit is examined further for corroborative\r\nsymptoms. The temperature of every one of the steerage is taken and the\r\nglass thermometer is not always cleaned as it is passed from mouth to\r\nmouth here in these crowded regions! A suspicious case is stripped of\r\nclothes then and there in the line. Despite satisfactory examinations,\r\nvessels are sometimes held up forty-eight hours, and every one in the\r\nsteerage, as well as his baggage and quarters, is sulphur-smoked,\r\nsteamed and washed. A fumigation hulk is used for this purpose, and it\r\nis the most hated vessel anchored in the harbor. I have known a ship’s\r\nwhite officers, afflicted with plague, cholera, etc., to be taken off\r\nto the plague hulk _Hygeia_, and their vessels to be detained fourteen\r\ndays for observation and cleansing before being released by the British\r\nand American doctors of the port. The detention anchorage ranges on the\r\nnorthwest of the usual fairway, and though a beautiful spot under the\r\nheathen hills of old China, it is naturally considered by many as a\r\nmost melancholy one.\r\n\r\nThere is always a smouldering fire of conflict burning in the hearts\r\nof ships’ agents, port doctors and United States Marine hospital\r\nsurgeons on duty abroad. The agents are inclined to imperfect care\r\nand quicker despatch of vessels. The United States doctors who,\r\nabroad, splendidly and incorruptibly guard the health of America, are\r\nlikely to injure competitive business for the sake of making safety\r\ndoubly sure. The proper course is “_in medio tutissimus ibis_.” I\r\nhave known these doctors to examine the earth around lily roots and\r\nprohibit their export to America during many months of the year. Ships’\r\ncaptains, doctors and agents, ever pressed by the management for\r\nincreased earnings, take every bit of risk they can, even in the case\r\nof west-bound Chinese suffering from phthisis, and the check of the\r\nUnited States Marine Hospital Service is salutary, and will continue to\r\nbe necessary. When a vessel is homeward bound the United States Marine\r\ndoctor at Hongkong will not give a clean bill of health for America\r\nuntil all steerage passengers and their effects have been washed and\r\nsteamed in disinfecting waters. Often the emigrants are stripped and\r\nAmerica thus saved from loathsome hidden diseases being imported. The\r\nscene is sometimes enough to make the doctors as sagacious as Solomon,\r\nor as compassionate as Florence Nightingale.\r\n\r\nWhat a work is opening up in China for the labors of the medical\r\nmissionary, first with the touch and then with the voice of the Angel\r\nof Salvation. The rigid medical examination of returning Chinese at\r\nHongkong and San Francisco is disliked by Chinese consuls, firms and\r\nthe steerage passengers themselves, but the best friend of China, if\r\nhe is enlightened as to the unsanitary conditions yet obtaining there,\r\ncould not ask America to lighten her severity, which is no more onerous\r\nthan Japan’s, until China cleans up her land, sanitizes her houses, and\r\nsupplies herself with a modern medical system. The inspection at San\r\nFrancisco sometimes calls for lancing of the ear at night to see if the\r\npatient is suffering from filariasis, and at Hongkong and sometimes\r\nat San Francisco the immigrant is required to disrobe, bathe and have\r\nhis effects fumigated. The Hongkong inspection can not obviate the\r\nwisdom of a new inspection at San Francisco to ward against hookworm,\r\nelephantiasis, plague, cholera and the unmentionable disease.\r\n\r\nHongkong is ever increasing its hospital equipment, which is now the\r\nmost extensive in the Far East. Some of the buildings erected on the\r\nmountain peaks are palatial. On the western slope of Victoria Mount\r\nthere is the worldwide known Tung Wah Hospital, managed by Chinese\r\neducated in the medical schools of Britain, America and Hongkong. At\r\nthis hospital Doctor Sun Yat Sen, the first president of China, was\r\na student some years ago. Over Bowen Road, above the clouds of Mount\r\nWanchai, is the sumptuous Military Hospital, and at the foot of the\r\nmountain is the no less splendid Naval Hospital. On Mount Kellett is\r\nSharp’s Hospital, and on Victoria Peak is the Peak Hospital. There is\r\nthe Civil Hospital, the Nethersole Hospital, hospitals over on the\r\nmainland at Kowloon, and there will be a railroad hospital at Kowloon.\r\nCanton has copied from Hongkong. The Chinese there are modernizing\r\ntheir ancient guild hospitals which lie outside of the eastern wall.\r\nPhilanthropy in only the smallest of the Hongkong hospitals has been\r\ndepended upon, most of them being municipal or service hospitals. At\r\nCanton is the immense Doctor Peter Parker Hospital, founded in 1835,\r\nfor which the American Presbyterian women of Philadelphia furnish\r\nthe medical missionaries. There are 300 beds, and 25,000 patients\r\nare treated annually. The Chinese do their part, having presented a\r\nbuilding for a medical college. The Gregg Hospitals for Women at Canton\r\nis presided over by Doctors Mary Fulton and Mary Niles, and the Chinese\r\nhave given $3,500 for a children’s ward. At Kowkiang, on the Yangtze,\r\nthere is the model Danforth Memorial Hospital, erected with American\r\nmoney and presided over by a noted Chinese lady physician who has taken\r\nthe name of Miss Mary Stone, and who graduated from the University of\r\nMichigan Medical School.\r\n\r\nIn remote large Hainan Island, in Suchow, at Paoting, Chingtu, Peking,\r\netc., there are American Presbyterian hospitals. Where there are now\r\nhundreds there will soon be thousands of medical missionaries and more\r\nmedical colleges to fit the Chinese to help themselves. It is the most\r\nimportant work in China,--more important even than foreign loans for\r\nrailways and industrials, and far more important than loans for armies\r\nand navies. Doctor F. C. Yen, of Yale Medical College, Changsha, is a\r\nfine example of a native medical man, trained in the best that the West\r\nknows. Several American universities have opened medical schools in\r\nChina, the University of Pennsylvania at Canton, Yale at Changsha in\r\nstern conservative Hunan province; and now Harvard proposes to open\r\na medical school possibly at Shanghai, to be staffed by the Harvard\r\nMedical School, and the diseases which they will attack are China’s\r\ncurses, the dangers of the world,--the skin diseases, tumors, the\r\ntwo plagues, cholera, dysentery, leprosy, malaria and consumption.\r\nOne-third of the money for the Scotch Presbyterian Hospital and medical\r\ncollege at Mukden was contributed by the Chinese, who now warmly\r\nappreciate Western medicine.\r\n\r\nThe day is not distant when the Chinese, placed on their feet in\r\nfinance, will pay half the expense of medical missions. The Chinese\r\ngive liquorice to men and animals as a cure for wasting diseases.\r\nFrom the skin of a venomous toad their doctors derive a preparation\r\nwhich they call Sen-so. It is a far more powerful stimulus to heart\r\naction than our drug digitalis. It is well known that deer’s horns\r\nare ground to powder by the old-fashioned Chinese doctors. In the\r\nvalley of the Wei River, just north of the Peling range in far western\r\nKansu province, stags are raised in enclosures for this purpose. The\r\nsoft prongs of the horn are cut off in summer time. The old-fashioned\r\ndoctors of China never dissected, as abuse of the body is contrary to\r\nConfucianism. They knew nothing of circulation, and little of anatomy,\r\nphysiology or chemistry. “Then Confucianism must go,” say the new\r\nChinese scientists. Two of their medical proverbs are:\r\n\r\n“A physician may cure every disease except the disease of Fate.”\r\n\r\n“Send for the diagnostician before the druggist, for the cure must fit\r\nthe disease.”\r\n\r\nFour great tropical medicine colleges have been opened outside of\r\nthe Orient. The first was the University of Liverpool School. Then\r\nfollowed the London School of Tropical Medicine, and the Hamburg School\r\nof the Germans. Now the New York Tropical Medical School has been\r\nopened at Twentieth Street and Second Avenue. The work will include\r\nthe translation of text-books, and America will be able to do much\r\nfor Southern China in the clinic on ships which the school will have\r\nas soon as the Panama Canal is open. Serums have yet to be found for\r\nthe paralyzing dengue which every foreigner in China has suffered from\r\nat one time or another: typhus, anæmia, dum-dum, tze-tze, sleeping\r\nsickness, amoebic dysentery, malaria and pneumonic plague, though the\r\nindefatigable Doctor Kitasato found a temporary serum for the last\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\nThe medical works translated into Chinese by medical missionaries\r\ninclude the following: Doctor J. G. Kerr’s (first teacher of Doctor\r\nSunyacius) translation of Bartholow’s _Practise of Medicine_, Doctor\r\nS. A. Hunter’s translation of a _Materia Medica and Pharmacopœia_,\r\nDoctor Dudgeon’s translation of Gray’s _Anatomy_, Doctor Porter’s\r\ntranslation of a physiology, Doctor Mary Fulton’s _Diseases of\r\nChildren_; _Nursing in Surgery_, and _Gynecology_, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of the trials of the Orient in its heated, humid,\r\nequatorial region, where I lived for three years; and the hardships,\r\ndangers and life-remembered punishment of its unavoidable, various\r\ndiseases, I am inclined to suggest in this book the formation of an\r\n“Equator Club,” eligibility for membership in which shall be at least\r\ntwo years’ uninterrupted residence between the tropics of Cancer and\r\nCapricorn. Such an experience was certainly a unique and trying one,\r\na tremendous test of physique, as a growing number, who have endured\r\nit, will confess, and a perpetuated remembrance of those days, and an\r\ninterest in the successors who have followed one to take up the white\r\nman’s growing burdens in those realms of the imperious sun, would\r\ncertainly do good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\nCHINESE WOMANHOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the last of our August the women of China celebrate the festival of\r\nthe goddess of needlework. The interesting legend told to the daughters\r\nof the house is as follows: This goddess, because of her wonderful\r\nskill, was given by the great god Tien to a worthy farmer. After\r\nthis life she incurred the wrath of the god and was removed from her\r\nhusband’s star. Once a year, when her star comes round again, magpies\r\nconduct her back to her husband’s star home, across the carpet of the\r\nMilky Way, where she is welcome for a while, because she is as good a\r\nneedleworker as he is a farmer and provider. The festival includes the\r\nexhibition on a table of the needlework of the women and the toy work\r\nof the girls. Wonderful toys of gummed sesame seeds, wax and paper are\r\nmade, and toys worked by clockwork or heat, which exhibit all kinds\r\nof rural life,--some of it humorous. From behind screens the women\r\nlisten to what the men callers have to say to the head of the family\r\nin praise of their handiwork. It is, however, principally a women’s\r\nfestival and encourages the production of the gorgeous embroidery of\r\nthe Chinese. A Chinese wit was asked the difference in the position\r\nof Chinese and Anglo-Saxon women, and she replied: “An Oriental man\r\nbeats his wife in public to show that he is indeed the ruler, but he\r\npets her in private, whereas a Western man pets his wife in public and\r\nbeats her in private.” I do not know what the remote Tibet men do\r\nwith their powerful women in private, but I do know that the women of\r\nTibet who come down into Szechuen and Yunnan provinces with the trading\r\ntrains are on an equal with man. They join him in work, play, in\r\nmeeting strangers and in holding the “cash,” and therefore are the most\r\nindependent of the Chinese women. They do not bind their feet, as they\r\nhave too much work to do. They come next to the Tonquinoise as perhaps\r\nthe best-looking of the Chinese. The best dressed women in China live\r\nin Kiangsu and Chekiang provinces. The dress of Korean women is not so\r\ngorgeous as the Chinese dress, the former wearing green or white, and\r\nhiding their heads in immense basket hats, “to keep them from flirting”\r\nthe wits say! The Korean woman at home, instead of modestly screening\r\nher face with a fan, does so by lifting up her wide sleeve. Muffs and\r\ngloves are not worn in the cold north. Instead, the wide long sleeve is\r\ngathered round the hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright, 1913, The Bobbs-Merrill Company.\r\n\r\n  Lighting China’s sea-ways by the National Customs Department.

In the New China the compressing of\r\n    feet is taboo.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe campaign of the Tien Tsu Hui (As-Heaven-Made-It Foot Society)\r\nagainst foot-binding is meeting with much success. Chinese women are\r\nrejoicing that they are not withheld from physical freedom and an\r\neducation, by being longer crippled. The idea that a bound foot is the\r\nsurest sign of a lady, and the best recommendation for marriage, is\r\ndying out. As prices increase with the material development of China,\r\nmen will not be able to hire servants to carry and wait on these\r\ncrippled women. Therefore economy will advance the reform also. The\r\nfamous viceroy of Wuchang, Chang Chih Tung, who died in 1909, was the\r\nfirst prominent Chinese official to become converted to the reform.\r\nThe late Empress Dowager Tse Hsi joined the movement. It is a pity\r\nthat more Chinese girls from the Yangtze and southern provinces do not\r\ncome to American and European schools, as their work, on returning\r\nto China, would do most for this reform. The snobbish idea, of course,\r\nwas that a girl who never needed to work, and had never worked, made\r\na very select wife, just as in America and Britain the “snobs” think\r\nthat a girl who has never worked, and can not work, makes a finer wife\r\nthan a woman who has been or is in business. The French have thought\r\notherwise for a long time. One of the pioneer foreign women, outside of\r\nthe missionaries, who worked and lectured in China for the unbinding of\r\nfeet, was Mrs. Archibald Little, author of _The Land of the Blue Gown_,\r\nand wife of the intrepid Yangtze explorer and author.\r\n\r\nThe following love tale is the one oftenest painted on your teacup\r\nand saucer, and other Chinese pottery, and on fans, etc. Kung She is\r\nthe sweet and lovely daughter of a rich man. She falls in love with\r\nher father’s bright and brave young secretary, who has more in rosy\r\nprospect and dreams than in lined pocket. The father proposes that\r\nthe daughter shall, against her will, marry a rich old suitor. The\r\nlovers in desperation elope over a bamboo bridge to an island pavilion\r\nof willow wood, with beautiful up-curving eaves. The wrathful suitor\r\nfollows and burns the pavilion and the bridge. The souls of the lovers\r\ntake refuge in the bodies of two doves which are seen cooing from the\r\nbranches of a banyan that grows above the pavilion. Thus we sit down\r\nto eat, and we fan ourselves each day over a beautiful love tale of\r\nromantic old China.\r\n\r\nThe queue is now going out as man’s head-dress in republican China.\r\nThe general custom with Chinese women is to dress the hair out behind,\r\nsticking in large-headed gold pins; and the Manchu’s dress it over\r\nthe ear, with the help of wide pins, and broad ribbons and flowers.\r\nThe aboriginal tribes of Lolos in Szechuen province, and Miao Tszes\r\nin Kweichau province, dress the hair on top of the head over rats, in\r\ntrue Western cone-style. The Chinese women oil their hair and brush it\r\nout smooth on forms. The only departure from this is a straight bang\r\nallowed to girls. They wonder if we have brushes or combs in the West,\r\nand point to our curls (called “rough dog”) as a proof of our tonsorial\r\ncarelessness.\r\n\r\nSome of the proverbs of the women are:\r\n\r\n“You can not tell a good husband that his wife has a defect.”\r\n\r\n“Ugly and beautiful daughters all have one face to a true mother.”\r\n\r\n“A man weds a wife for her goodness, but a concubine for her face.”\r\n\r\n“Mother’s love is even in beasts, for the hungriest tiger will not eat\r\nits whelps.”\r\n\r\n“Deeds are better than admiration.”\r\n\r\n“A virtuous wife is like a loyal statesman; she knows only one king,\r\nher husband.”\r\n\r\n“Mother and father first and wealth after.”\r\n\r\n“She is dead indeed who walks around with a dead heart.”\r\n\r\n“If you listen to every one’s advice, the picture will never be\r\nstraight on the wall.”\r\n\r\n“Let thy purse and not thine eyes tell thee what to buy.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t expect the looking glass to reveal more than you put into\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nBecause of the worship of men ancestors, Confucianism has been called a\r\nman’s religion. Yet it recognizes woman’s work. A bronze brazier stands\r\nbefore the open white marble altar at Peking, in which once a year at\r\nthe ancient Chou sacrifices to the God of Heaven, the emperor-pope\r\nburns silk. The Manchu emperor, in abdicating the throne, retained\r\nhis sacerdotal offices, though strictly speaking, they should have\r\nfallen to the Ducal Kung Fut Tszes, of Shangtung province, who are\r\nthe seventy-seventh in direct line from Confucius. A number of the\r\nKungs, however, are Christians, and they exerted little insistence on\r\ntheir Confucian privileges. The care of the worms and the weaving of\r\nsilk is distinctly woman’s work in China. This sacrifice is repeated\r\nby the governor at every capital, and heads of families sometimes, in\r\ntheir own office of patriarch priest, make the silk sacrifice. This is\r\nquite distinct from hiring a Taoist bonze to burn silvered and gilded\r\nimitations of money to appease a devil or “ying” spirit. A patriarch\r\nwould have no influence there, the operation requiring a specialist\r\nmore familiar with witches and demons! The Chinese women always sit on\r\nchairs and lounges (kangs); the Koreans and Japanese sit on the floor.\r\nThis does not mean that the Koreans, whom the Japanese have conquered,\r\nare in sympathy with the latter, for they thoroughly hate each other.\r\nThe Chinese never wear a feather, except to denote literary rank in\r\nmen. Therefore the bucolic natives who see the fashion of western\r\nwomen, remark: “Only your women are educated, and very talented at\r\nthat, some having a dozen literary degrees.” Millinery is for men, not\r\nfor women in China, as only men wear a feathered cap. The gorgeous tail\r\nfeathers of the Machi species of pheasant are particularly popular.\r\nPreserves of these birds are kept in the Wei valley, north of the\r\nPeling range of mountains in far western Kansu province, to provide the\r\nmen milliners with supplies!\r\n\r\nA well-known custom at Chinese weddings is the effort of the bride\r\nto sit upon part of the groom’s gown when they are drinking the\r\nbetrothal tea together. The cups are tied with a red string, and the\r\ngroom must not break the string in his effort to release his gown. If\r\nthe bride succeeds it means that she will be his ruler. A partially\r\nsimilar custom prevails among the Miaotse aboriginal tribes of Yunnan\r\nprovince. The friends of the groom endeavor to prevent the bride’s\r\nbrothers from throwing her veil on the roof of the house. If the latter\r\nare successful in the rush, the omen is that the bride will rule the\r\ngroom, saying in any argument: “Remember that on June 15th my veil\r\nwent on your roof!” The midwife is a well-filled calling, but she does\r\nnot go by that name. She is called the “life-catcher” throughout the\r\nland. The “mother-in-law” joke does not obtain in China. Its place is\r\ntaken by the son-in-law joke. It is the aim of the son-in-law and his\r\nwife to “go and live on mother” as long as possible. Mother resents\r\nit with the usual complaint: “Here comes my son-in-law, with his wife\r\nand six children, to live on us again for a month; dearie me,” etc.!\r\nWhen a family marries off a daughter, generally to save the expense\r\nof supporting her, they hope to see the last of her as far as that\r\nexpense goes. Family courtesy, the Confucian “li” code, prescribes\r\nyearly entertainment, however, of the son-in-law’s family, which is\r\nnot reciprocated, and hence the standing of the son-in-law joke as a\r\nmirth-provoker among those who perceive the code’s requirements obeyed,\r\nwith exactness but not with cheerfulness!\r\n\r\nAlthough the race has for centuries shaved the heads of the men almost\r\nto baldness, they have a great abhorrence of baldness in women, and\r\nthis is frequently pleaded as a cause for divorce or breaking of an\r\nengagement (marriage contract). The women in general have luxuriant\r\nhair, though it is coarse, and its color and luster remain till late\r\nin life, owing to the use of oils, the absence of hats, and the\r\nout-of-door habits. If the lion-like chow dog (yellow or black) is the\r\npet of the men, the Pekingese toy spaniel is the pet of the Manchu\r\nwoman. She calls it her “sleeve dog.” The late Empress Dowager Tse Hsi\r\nenumerated its points as follows: “It shall learn to bite a stranger;\r\nits toy body shall be maned and fixed with the fierce eyes of the\r\ngreat lion seeking its prey. Its ears shall be set like the sails of a\r\nwar junk; its nose shall be stubby like the monkey god of the Hindus;\r\nits forelegs shall be bowed so that it can walk over the foot of its\r\nmistress, but shall not be able to stray far from the yamen; its feet\r\nshall be tufted so that its step shall be as on turf; and its color\r\nshall suit every change of gown. It shall be fed on the breasts of\r\nquails, livers of curlews and sharks’ fins. Its drink shall be Hankau,\r\nfirst-budded tea and antelope’s milk. If ill, it shall be anointed\r\nwith the fat of leopards, and drink a thrush-egg full of the juice of\r\nthe custard apple and dissolved rhinoceros’ horn. If very ill, piebald\r\nleeches shall be applied to it.” Despite all this poetry which aptly\r\ngoes with this fashionable dog, it thrives very well on Spratt’s dog\r\nbiscuit in the salons of West End, London, and Fifth Avenue, New York.\r\nA number of ladies are mixing up Chinese and Japanese names for the\r\npets at the bench shows (Peking Yen, for instance), but the dog answers\r\nvery well to the names Jip, Tip, etc., which we used to call those\r\nold favorite toy dogs, the black-and-tans. The dog looks like a cross\r\nbetween a Pomeranian and a King Charles spaniel. The face is decidedly\r\nlion-like; the bushy tail sweeps well over the back as does that of his\r\nbig brother, the Chinese chow dog. The legs are short and bowed, and\r\nthe manner is very alert.\r\n\r\nPossibly overmuch has been written that the Chinese despise female\r\nchildren and worship male children. In the economic and religious\r\nstructure of old China boys have been more valuable, but the human\r\nheart of the race has responded to love for its girls. Poverty, more\r\nthan hardness of heart, has induced the race in instances to sell its\r\ngirls; for China has been very poor because of flood and famine,\r\nresulting from inefficiency of government and the non-development of\r\nmines and manufacturing. The two greatest teachers of old China have\r\nfor twenty-five centuries taught love of children in the following\r\namong other maxims. Confucius said: “Treat the young tenderly,” and\r\nMencius wrote: “The great man is he who does not lose his child’s\r\nheart.” Where the parents can afford it, the Chinese dress their boys\r\nand girls expensively and gorgeously, and fondle them as lovingly as do\r\nthe Hebrews, who are supposed to set the standard in love for children,\r\nas compared with us colder northern races. One of the first things that\r\nthe new government will attempt to suppress will be the sale of girl\r\nslaves and concubinage. The population of China will fall or remain\r\nstationary, which will be a good thing for China. There is, therefore,\r\nno “Yellow Peril” for the West, as the Emperor William enunciated in\r\n1898. The poorer a man, the more children he desires in China, so that\r\nsons may take care of him in old age, but he forgets that he is raising\r\nuneducated sons and neglected girls, who are often sold into slavery.\r\nBetter a family of four well-cared-for children in the new hygienic\r\nCathay than a family of ten in the old China. China’s population will\r\nfall under the new régime, but her efficiency, education and comfort\r\nwill advance, and those who will benefit the most, as compared with\r\ntheir former condition, will be her women.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the revolution, October, 1911, to February, 1912, there\r\nwere 400,000 starving girls and women in the Yangtze and Hwei River\r\nvalleys alone who offered to sell themselves for food; China’s courts\r\nwill no more defend the legality of such contracts under duress, as we\r\nin the West must revise our “freedom of contract” and “confession” laws\r\nwhere an uninformed or a restrained individual signs away rights. Every\r\nChinese boy has till now married early in life, Shanghai being an\r\nexception in having a large demi-monde colony. The _Kuo Kuang Pao_, a\r\nnative paper of Peking, complained in a late issue of courtesans (with\r\nmodesty they call it rather the “custom of Shanghai”) coming to Peking,\r\nand soliciting students brazenly in the streets. Shanghai has a “slave\r\nrefuge” for the protection of abandoned and abused girls. Intense\r\npoverty on account of famine is at the base of this curse. It is not\r\nas common in Hongkong and Canton as in the valleys of the Hoang, Han,\r\nYangtze and Hwei Rivers.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Chinese woman, taken by the white man, who is mean\r\nenough to do it, as a common law wife, and of their Eurasian children,\r\nwho are often not acknowledged, or are deserted, is a pathetic one in\r\nHongkong, Shanghai and many treaty ports. It was more common in the\r\nold days than it is now, and men of high position often fell, when the\r\nOriental ports were designated over an ill-informed world as the “white\r\nman’s grave,” to which no white woman would come. There are Eurasian\r\nschools and orphanages in Hongkong, Shanghai, Macao, etc., and the\r\ncolonies of deserted Eurasians have a population of thousands. They are\r\nfar from unintelligent. The best billiard player in Hongkong was of\r\nthis mixed race. They have dark eyes and hair and dress in both foreign\r\nand Chinese style. They are taller and have larger heads than the pure\r\nChinese. In the second and third generations the hair turns fairer.\r\nNaturally they partake of the characteristics of each race. A Eurasian\r\nis more sprightly than the Chinese, and he is inclined to the sporting\r\nand spendthrift proclivities of the foreigner. They are the clerks\r\nand second men of the ports. Few rise high, though many now attend\r\ncolleges. They are the best penmen and linguists of the Far Fast,\r\nthough not earnest enough to become scholars, or persistent enough\r\nto become the successful merchants which the men of their mother’s\r\nrace are. Feeling sometimes acutely the opprobrium which is visited\r\nupon them by both races, they often claim a dark foreign nationality,\r\ngenerally Portuguese of Macao colony.\r\n\r\nI want to relate the remarkable history of one Eurasian and his mother.\r\nI shall say no more of his father than that in blood and ability he\r\nwas one of the noblest names that came for a long sojourn in the Far\r\nEast. His position was such that the father could not own the son,\r\nespecially as in time the former married a white woman. The boy, who\r\nfrom the beginning bore a Chinese name, was the picture of his father,\r\nand his dressing in Chinese clothes and wearing a queue shocked all\r\nof us who knew the history, for the boy was taller than the Chinese\r\nand had the face of a foreigner. Some laughed, for the youth seemed\r\nto be a foreigner on perpetual masquerade. He came into our hong as\r\nclerk, was easily the best penman and figurer in the office. His\r\nmanners were those of fashionable West End, London, or genteel Upper\r\nFifth Avenue; you felt when you heard him speak that you were talking\r\nto your superior. He often had business dealings with his father, yet\r\nhe did not seem conscious of the relationship. The son, being even\r\nthe abler man, the painful dramatic situation was pitiful. The tall\r\nEurasian youth married a Chinese woman in time, and reverted to his\r\nmother’s race, and his deserted Chinese mother returned to her blood,\r\nmarried a Chinese, had many pure blood children, and publicly disowned\r\nher Eurasian boy. Privately, however, the boy and mother sometimes\r\nmet, and the scene matched in dramatic pathos the meetings with the\r\nfather. The youth seemed to be cheerful despite all these trials. I\r\nnever saw him reveal pride or resentment; only in this way, when in\r\nlater years for a time, he came into a position of power in a Chinese\r\ncompany which entered into international trade, he was merciless when\r\nthe white competitor withstood him. I have often felt his mighty\r\nblows and been outwitted by his commercial strategy. He smiled in a\r\ncomplacent way as though to say: “Why might I not circumvent you; you\r\nknow something, perhaps, about one race, but nothing about the other.\r\nI, being a Eurasian, know much about the two races.” He deserved all\r\nhis conquests. He had something to avenge, and he did right in casting\r\nhis life with China and not Europe. The remarkably dramatic setting of\r\nthis boy’s, his mother’s and father’s life would have given Shakespeare\r\nmaterial for a tragedy, and the foreigner concerned would have paid\r\nthe price of his heartless audacity, despite the romantic poetry\r\nwhich Pierre Loti wove around such relationships in his book _Madame\r\nChrysanthème_.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most significant sign of China’s reform is the new status\r\nof women. Never before have Chinese women traveled with their merchant\r\nhusbands. In a few isolated instances Chinese ministers have taken\r\ntheir wives abroad, but there have never been mixed parties of men\r\nand women until the revolution. On November, 1911, a touring party\r\nof prominent members of Chinese trading guilds of several of the\r\nprovinces met at Shanghai for a business tour of Japan. They were\r\naccompanied by their wives. The New China has its Mrs. Pankhurst in\r\nMiss Yik Yung Ying, of Canton, who is foreign trained and has admission\r\nto the Nanking Assembly as representing the women of her province of\r\nKwangtung. She has obtained from the Nanking Assembly a promise of\r\nequal suffrage on equal property and educational conditions. Some of\r\nher suffragettes attacked the assembly police and broke windows in true\r\nPankhurst style, the patient Chinese wits only remarking: “This froth\r\nwill blow off the glass and leave the clear liquid!”\r\n\r\nMany girls of the mission schools of Canton, Fuchau and the Yangtze\r\ncities of the rebellion could not be restrained from serving at\r\nthe front in the republican revolution. Some of them tried to form\r\nbomb-throwing corps. Where they insisted on service the missionaries\r\nof Wuchang, Hankau, Shanghai and Nanking organized them in several\r\nuniformed Red Cross Corps, which performed effective and brave work.\r\nThe large clans, or family villages, are sending to the missions for\r\ngraduate teachers to take charge of their girls. The head man (hsiang\r\nlao) sets apart a bedroom, a schoolroom and a courtyard for the\r\nschool, and the whole family clan contributes. The mothers of course\r\ncontinue their instruction in the Chinese classics, folk lore, religion\r\nand their inimitable needlework. Elsewhere I have spoken of the St.\r\nHilda’s school at Wuchang, under American Episcopal auspices, which\r\naims to become the Women’s College of Central China. A daughter of the\r\noriginal reformer, Kang Yu Wei, has studied in America. Miss Li Yu,\r\nthe granddaughter of Li Hung Chang, took the course at Wells Female\r\nCollege, at Aurora, New York, where she was a prize scholar.\r\n\r\nCornell in particular, Hartford High, Leland Stanford, Columbia,\r\nUniversity of Washington State, Wellesley, Vassar, Smith, University\r\nof Michigan, and all the women’s and co-ed colleges in America have\r\nenrolled more Chinese women than all the other women’s colleges of the\r\nworld, but not so many as they might and will, now that the new régime\r\nhas opened with rainbow promise. Forty young Chinese women are studying\r\nmedicine in America through the work of China’s first woman doctor,\r\nMiss Ya Mi Kin, who is in charge of the Tientsin Woman’s Hospital and\r\nnurses’ school.\r\n\r\nA remarkable Chinese woman doctor, going by the name of Doctor Mary\r\nStone (educated at University of Michigan), manages the American\r\nhospital at Kiukiang, and Doctor Tsang Cho Kin, a Cantonese lady, is\r\nprominent in modern medical work at Canton, Fuchau and Shanghai. The\r\nAmerican Presbyterian women (to instance only one denomination here)\r\nhave seventeen girls’ schools open at Canton alone, and in addition the\r\nfollowing exemplary development: a school for blind girls, in charge\r\nof Doctor Mary Niles; a boarding school for children of lepers; a\r\nhospital school for girls in charge of Mrs. Kerr; a training school for\r\nwomen teachers; the Hackett Medical College for women; and the Turner\r\nNurses’ School, under the charge of the noted Doctor Mary Fulton. At\r\nNingpo there is a girls’ school and a women’s industrial school. At\r\nShanghai there is the well-known girls’ school at the south gate; and\r\nat Hangchow and Nanking there are girls’ boarding schools. At Nanking\r\nthe wives of Chinese taotais (officials such as mayors) are encouraged\r\nto preside over mothers’ meetings. At Peking there is the Bridgman\r\nCollege for Women, a women’s medical college and nurses’ school, a\r\ngirls’ day and industrial school. At Paoting, in Pechili, there is\r\nthe Union School for Girls; at Tengchow, in Shangtung, a girls’ high\r\nschool and industrial school; and at Tsinan a girls’ school. At many of\r\nthese girls’ schools, presided over by foreign women, the Chinese pay\r\nmuch of the expense; and they are copying the schools to the best of\r\ntheir ability all over the land for their girls and women, and calling\r\nupon the mission women’s schools for graduates whom they may use as\r\nteachers. There is no greater proof that the New China has begun its\r\nmarch toward the sun than that its womanhood has at last been thus\r\nrecognized in modern education and opportunity.\r\n\r\nWomanhood over the world responds to the same chord of sympathy. One of\r\nthe contributions to the Woman’s _Titanic_ Memorial came from a Chinese\r\ngirl, Ying Low, with this message: “I send this for Captain Smith’s\r\nsoul.” The word for woman in Chinese is “nu,” and the probability now\r\nis that she will be new indeed, and the foundation stone of the New\r\nChina for her sons.\r\n\r\nThe first modern style Chinese marriage among those not Christian was\r\nsolemnized in April, 1912, in the well-known Chang Su Ho Gardens,\r\nShanghai. The families concerned were wealthy and the marriage was a\r\ncivil one. A ring, music, flowers, witnesses, a public ceremony and\r\ncertificate contract all came into use. There was nothing picturesquely\r\nold-style or secret, as the middleman, the closed chair, the ceremony\r\nat the groom’s house, the joined teacups, the contests between teams\r\nof both families, the worshiping of sticks and house coffins, the\r\ndiscordant orchestra, the chairs of food, the goose present and\r\nheckling of the bride by practical jokers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY IN CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nAgriculture has always been a leading calling in China. The farms are\r\nsmall and are intensively worked. They have been too small, and the\r\nimmense population has been crowded into the river plains only of the\r\nvast country. Not one quarter of China and its territories is worked\r\nas it might be. The adopting of machinery and the application of the\r\nsingle tax to some of the unworked land by the new régime will make\r\npossible the enlargement of farms, and the consequent stocking with\r\nmeat, milk, egg, wool and skin-producing animals on a vast scale.\r\nThe decrease of population that will occur owing to the decadence of\r\nancestor-worshiping Confucianism, and the system of early marriage\r\nand concubinage, will necessitate the introduction of agricultural\r\nmachinery. An increased agriculture will bring about the exportation\r\nof food products from so fertile and sunny a land. The enhancement of\r\nhygiene with the new medical knowledge will confirm this increased\r\nproduction in agriculture, as there will be no waste of life through\r\nignorance, and human surplus vitality will be directed to increasing\r\nthe productivity of the land, and the reclamation of the waste spaces.\r\n\r\nIn agricultural wisdom little can be taught the Chinese. In love of\r\nand assiduity in agriculture no one equals him. Professors King and\r\nRoss, of Wisconsin University, have dealt in an exhaustive way with\r\nthe subject, and other books recommended to the inquirer are Ball’s\r\n_Things Chinese_, Williams’s _Middle Kingdom_, Fielde’s _Corner of\r\nCathay_, the journals of the Royal Asiatic Society, Lay’s _Chinese As\r\nThey Are_, and Douglas’s _Society in China_. The list of products is\r\nexceedingly long. Here are just a few as we run down the gamut from the\r\nnorth to the south: wheat, all millets, maize, buckwheat, sugar beet,\r\ntobacco, pulse, hay, straw braid, soy and other beans, barley, sorghum,\r\nrhubarb and drugs, hemp, all berries and tree fruits, cotton, sesamum,\r\nindigo, persimmons, melons, walnuts, almonds, olives, peanuts, tea,\r\nbamboo, rice, sweet and white potatoes, grass-cloth plant, oranges,\r\nsugar, coffee, rubber, cocoa, pumeloes, lichee, quince, ginger, loquat,\r\nmulberry, mustard, tallow trees, flowers for perfumery, lily roots for\r\nfood and candy, colza nuts for oil, rhus nuts for varnish, camphor,\r\nall hardwoods, insect wax, matting and opium. Their truck farms are\r\nunequaled. They seem to lose not one lettuce or cabbage leaf. Every\r\nbug is nipped in the chrysalis by hand; everybody works from dewy dawn\r\nto twilight’s star! Where China exports $40,000,000 of agricultural\r\nproducts to-day to the manufacturing nations that border the Pacific\r\nand Atlantic, to-morrow she will export $400,000,000, besides becoming\r\nherself richer in pantry and bank.\r\n\r\nThe farmers are always searching for soil enrichers, with such success\r\nthat you seldom see the nitrogen-starved yellow instead of green field.\r\nNot a handful of ashes is wasted; not an herb or branch but is gathered\r\nfor the compost heap to make humus. Water is brought over the land,\r\nthat it may deposit its nitrogenous wealth, and the mud of canals is\r\ndredged for the valuable rotted slime. Three times a year a part of\r\nChina, 1,200 miles long and 1,200 miles wide, is one vast flooded\r\nfield. By placing mud walls around his fields, a farmer does not need\r\nto raise all his irrigation water by power. Rather, he directs gravity,\r\nfor he saves the rapid surface draining of the land, especially in\r\nthe higher terraces. In the lower terraces he digs wells to store the\r\nsurface water against drought. The water showered upon the higher\r\nfields he lets down to the lower during dry periods. They believe in a\r\nrotation of soils as well as in a rotation of crops, and will exchange\r\nbodily a rice field’s and an orchard’s top soil. By intensive farming a\r\nChinese gets as much from a ten-acre farm as we get from a hundred-acre\r\none, and he never permits a soil to be impoverished by its crop. You\r\nnever see his implements, rude as they are, left uncovered over night.\r\nHe carries home even his straw fork, which is made three-pronged by\r\ntraining nature instead of fashioning by hand. When the farmer’s wife\r\nand girls are not in the field they are working up straw braid for\r\nAmerica’s and Europe’s hats and weaving silk and making embroidery for\r\nwestern gowns.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Yangtze River human nightsoil is mixed with water and\r\napplied to the farms in liquid form. North of the Yangtze the drier\r\nclimate permits of mixing the manure with earth and drying the slabs\r\nfor transport. A farmer in South China willingly builds a toilet on the\r\npublic road and requests the public, including the humorously shocked\r\nforeigner, with a sign which is much shorter than my words, to remember\r\nhow China must be fertilized in order to support more inhabitants to\r\nthe acre than any other land! The result is that China’s streams,\r\noutside of the suspended mud and silt that they carry, alone of all\r\ncountries, are nearly pure, and foreign sanitary engineers take potable\r\nwater directly from the rivers, as at Hankau, Canton, etc. The loss\r\nto the land of fertilizers by burning them as fuel, in the absence\r\nof forests and worked coal mines, is nowhere better illustrated than\r\nin Mongolia and the province of Fukien. In Mongolia the camel dung\r\nis dried and used as fuel. In Fukien, railway development has been\r\nretarded, and the coal of the Ankoi and other mines does not reach the\r\nhut in the field. Straw, therefore, instead of returning to the land,\r\nis of necessity used as fuel. For instance, take the tanning industry.\r\nThe hides are thrown in a pond, in which there is a solution of alum.\r\nAfter peeling, the leather is stretched on springy frames of strong\r\nbamboo, and placed over an earthen furnace for smoking and drying. The\r\nfuel is _straw_, which gives the hide a yellow color, at a lamentable\r\ncost. In their opening era of manufacturing, the Chinese do not intend\r\nto permit dyes, chemicals, refuse or sewage to be drained into their\r\nstreams and rivers, which from their source to the sea are used over\r\nand over for irrigation and for drinking.\r\n\r\nChinese matting comes mainly from the West River (Si Kiang) ports west\r\nof Canton. The fresh water reed is in some cases fertilized, as at Tung\r\nKun and Lintan, so as to produce size and sheen. The reed is split\r\nwhen cut in the green and the sun rounds the strands. German aniline\r\ndyes are used, which produce a sorry product as compared with the\r\nfamous natural dyes of old China. In producing red, however, the dye\r\nis obtained by boiling a Philippine redwood. The looms are simple hand\r\nlooms, worked in the humble homes of the people. The mats are dried\r\nand set over a charcoal fire. The shipping season is in the fall. Vast\r\nquantities, baled in reeds, come by junk and steamer from the riverine\r\nports to Hongkong, where they are put in godowns until the arrival of\r\na trans-Pacific or Suez steamer, or a Standard Oil Company freighter\r\nand sailing vessel. The very low rate is controlled by the sailing\r\nship, and quantity is of the first essence of importance in making\r\nthe business pay any one concerned, except the middleman in America\r\nor Europe. Better dyes might be furnished to the reed farmers and\r\nbetter looms and designs will now probably be distributed among them.\r\nIt is a floor covering which should grow more popular from an economic,\r\nand especially a sanitary point of view, as it does not harbor moths\r\nor germs, and is easy to handle; and from a conservation point of\r\nview, its wider use would reserve carpet wool for clothing. The clean\r\nJapanese despise us for our use of the fixed, unsanitary woolen carpet.\r\nThe seed of the reed is planted, just as rice is, in a sheltered spot\r\nin the fall. Transplanting occurs early in the year and the fields are\r\nirrigated. It takes two men or women four days to weave a roll on a\r\nvery crude loom.\r\n\r\nThe farmer is king. He has attacked the old magnificent roads, eight\r\nfeet wide, cut at great expense in the mountains, carried soil over\r\npart of them and planted his corn. Marble-lined lotus gardens of\r\nmagnificent old estates he has filled up with his rice seed; and\r\nthe grain waves beneath the windows of deserted palaces, the owners\r\nprobably long ago, because of their opinions and not their crimes,\r\nhaving, in Manchu days, dropped their heads beneath the blow of the\r\ntaifo swords while they bowed upon their knees in a line at far-away\r\nPeking!\r\n\r\nGinger is grown extensively in China. It is used for cooking and as a\r\nmedicine. Preserved in sugar, it is known world-wide as a delicious\r\nconfection. The Chinese prefer it in a heavy syrup. This species of\r\nlily grows about two feet high. The roots are very heavy and are kept\r\nirrigated in mud. It is one of the few plants which leave their odor in\r\nthe air in the fields where they grow. The marmalade industry will have\r\na great future in the vast southern provinces. Java, the Philippines\r\nand Formosa, are near with their sugar, and the provinces of Kwantung,\r\nKwangsi and Fukien have noble orchards of pumelo, lemon and orange\r\ntrees. As the family-village farms the apparently undivided fields as\r\na community, watchers have to be set in the fields and at the granary\r\nfloors, when harvest time approaches. A platform is built of bamboo,\r\nand the watcher mounts it, carrying along his gong. As there are no\r\nfences and few trees, the watcher commands a wide view, and deters\r\nprivate bands and prowlers of other villages from making sudden raids.\r\nManchuria has been found to be an ideal ground for the sugar beet,\r\nthe black soil producing a higher percentage of sugar than anywhere\r\nin the world. The sugar industry is a most important addition to the\r\nagricultural wealth of those three extremely rich provinces, which are\r\ndestined to help in the feeding of industrial America. Returned Chinese\r\nemigrants from Java and America started in 1911, in Fukien and Chekiang\r\nprovinces the cultivation of cotton on an extended scale, looking to\r\nthe new mills of Shanghai, Hangchow and Wuchang to buy the product,\r\nwhich will be shipped by junks, steamer and the new coast railway. The\r\nChinese value their highly tilled lands near the large cities at a\r\nprice equal to forty-five dollars in gold for our acre.\r\n\r\nBritish Hongkong set the example in reforestation. Germany followed at\r\nKiachou, Shangtung, with acacia, fir, ash, larch, walnut and oak trees\r\nalong the railway line. Japan followed in South Manchuria, and China\r\nherself established a forestry school at Mukden in 1908, and in Kansu\r\nlater. It is absolutely essential to retard the snows and rainfalls\r\nat the heads of the great rivers if the awful floods and consequent\r\nfamines are ever to be obviated in the valleys of the Hoangho, Han,\r\nYangtze and Hwei Rivers. The camphor is China’s own tree, especially in\r\nFormosa, Fukien, and the southern provinces. Ceylon, California, Texas,\r\nFlorida, Jamaica, Malay, Italy and German East Africa have successfully\r\nintroduced the tree, and will in time help to supply the world’s\r\ngrowing requirements for the arts and industries, which synthetic\r\ncamphor can not do, because of the deforestation of America’s southern\r\npine, which now supplies the necessary oil of turpentine. Camphor can\r\nbe distilled from any part of the tree, even the dead leaves, and some\r\nconservation foresters, especially Americans and Germans, are urging\r\na world movement to use the leaves, dropped twigs and cuttings alone\r\nfor this purpose. Camphor formerly was made by cutting up the tree\r\nand treating the chips with water in a closed vessel, the volatilized\r\ncamphor condensing on rice straw packed in the head of the still. The\r\ndeposit was purified by sublimation in glass retorts in the presence of\r\nlime.\r\n\r\nI have for years been writing that the Chinese is a born humorist. The\r\nhumor of their arboriculturists is well known in their stunting and\r\ntwisting of trees and bamboos. The matched curved bamboos of the Fati\r\nand other gardens of Canton are famous. Another quaint form is the\r\nsplitting of a tree trunk so as to form a living arch. When the tree is\r\nyoung, it is uprooted and split up the trunk and replanted in the road\r\nleading to a shrine or temple. As the trunk grows apart, the road leads\r\nunder the arch. Under the shelter of the north wall of the imperial\r\nsection of the city of Peking, there are famous old cryptomeria\r\ncypresses split in this way. The humorist is saying: “See Nature’s god\r\nwith his grotesque products laughing at man’s idea of religion!” The\r\nfarmer and his boy are humorists. They meet you on the highroad and\r\nlaugh because the pigs and geese which they are driving to market all\r\nhave tiny straw sandals on their feet, and the water buffalo which they\r\nare riding to the exchange has sandals, but they themselves are in\r\ntheir bare feet, and they point out to you the humorous incongruity!\r\n\r\nThe very handsome Hagenbeck pheasant from the Kobdo valley of\r\nManchuria, fiftieth parallel, can live farthest north of any pheasant,\r\nand can therefore withstand our winters. It is large and edible. The\r\nMongolian pheasant has been acclimated on the Rothschild estate in\r\nHerts, England. The Manchurian eared pheasant is heavy and edible, but\r\nunlike the others is not wild and active enough for the game fields.\r\nAccordingly it best suits the poulterer of China. The pheasant is\r\na fairly cheap dish at all the clubs and hotels of China, and the\r\nindentured clerk of Hongkong is therefore to his surprise dining like\r\na king daily on the game which the owner of his concern would consider\r\nat home a luxury reserved for the Christmas dinner! Some of the native\r\nproverbs are:\r\n\r\n“No matter where the stream is, the sea is calling it.”\r\n\r\n“Frost and ice are made of water, but they don’t grow things like rain\r\nand dew.”\r\n\r\n“A spark is small, but it can burn a thousand farms.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t try to put out the burning field with tears; run for water.”\r\n\r\n“One bad bean makes the whole basket rot.”\r\n\r\n“Rain on a summer’s dawn means a clear day, but a rain at noon will\r\nlast.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\nCHINESE ARCHITECTURE AND ART\r\n\r\n\r\n“The glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome” are\r\nunearthed a foot at a time to the wondering eyes of the world by the\r\ntireless antiquarian-architect. China has some extensive ruins that\r\nshow the death struggle of a dynasty with the tooth of the destroyer,\r\nTime. Near Singan, in Shensi province, are the ruins of the tombs,\r\narches and palaces of the builder of the Great Wall. On the left bank\r\nof the Orkhon River in Mongolia, southwest of Kuren, are the ruins of\r\nthe Uigur empire, seventh to ninth centuries, A. D. These Mongols were\r\nfirst Buddhist, then Nestorian Christian, and afterward Mohammedan\r\nin faith, and their fathers took part in the terrific invasions of\r\nEurope that have made Russia one quarter Asiatic. Ujfalvy, Schott and\r\nProfessor Thomsen have written books on the race, and Heikel and Radlov\r\nexplored the ruins in 1890–1. On the right bank of the same river,\r\nfifteen miles southeast, at the edge of the Gobi Desert, are the ruins\r\nof the Mongol empire of the thirteenth century, founded by Ogodai Khan\r\nin 1234 A. D., and whose greatest conqueror, Kublai Khan, of whom Marco\r\nPolo wrote, overran all China and Turkestan. Had it not been for a\r\nlucky storm that destroyed his armada, he would have overrun Japan also.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and fifty miles northwest of Pnom Penh, in a deserted\r\ntropical jungle, are the ruins of the Khmer dynasty which ruled\r\nCambodia from the eighth to the twelfth centuries. These gorgeous\r\npalaces were built for luxurious Oriental kings when the early Mercian,\r\nNorthumbrian and Wessex chiefs were shivering in wooden huts in our\r\nprimeval England. The ruins are at Angkor on the north of the Great\r\nSummer Lake. The main temple of the Angkor Wat, in a walled enclosure,\r\nis in splendid preservation, and is one pf the world’s most wonderful\r\narchitectural curiosities. It is shaped like a wide Chinese temple, but\r\nhas in addition splendid pagodas one hundred and eighty feet high over\r\nthe entrances. The architecture is Indo-Chinese. There is much carving\r\nand sculpture, fine corridors and columns that were colored. Five\r\nmiles north is another walled ruin, thirty feet in height, enclosing\r\nan area of two miles square, the walls pierced by five gorgeous gates.\r\nThe ruins stand alone in the moonlight, unclaimed and untenanted.\r\nWhat few Siamese, Shans or Annamese may wander here, fall down in\r\nspeechless worship. The dense jungle is filled with insects, reptiles,\r\nwild animals, and but for them the silence is primeval. Pierre Loti\r\nrecently visited the ruins by sailing up the Mekong River from Saigon\r\nto Pnom Penh. There he took elephants and oxen one hundred and fifty\r\nmiles for the Great Summer Lake, across which he paddled. His book,\r\n_Un Pelerin d’Angkor_, not yet translated, was issued in French by\r\nCalmann-Levy, Paris, in 1912. Other French authors on this subject are\r\nDelaporte (_Voyage au Camboge_); Fournereau (_Les Ruins d’Angkor_), and\r\nTissandier (_Cambodje-Java_).\r\n\r\nTwo hundreds miles north of Angkor, at Korat, are further Khmer ruins.\r\nThe other ruins and tombs of old China are those of the Ming dynasty at\r\nNankou pass, north of Peking, and Nanking; the Manchu dynasty at Mukden\r\nand northwest of Peking; and the Sung dynasty at Hangchow. The tomb of\r\nPrince Ki Chah of the then Wu principality, who died B. C. 530, and\r\nwhich bears an inscription prepared by Confucius, can be seen to-day\r\nlying between the new British-built railway and the Grand Canal, twenty\r\nmiles east of Changchow in the south of Kiangsu province. The laws of\r\nthe Tsin principality, 513 B. C., were engraved on iron, but have not\r\nbeen recovered in any tomb or on any wall. Individual pagoda ruins\r\nand ancient walls cover the land, as does star-dust the sky. Laws,\r\ncustoms, history and a relation of the Rites, were engraved on metal\r\nbowls, which stood on three legs. These bowls were handed down through\r\nthe dynasties to the princes, together with the ancestral tablets, as\r\na sign of royal authority. There exists to-day in a temple on Silver\r\nIsland, near Chinkiang in Kiangsu province, such a tripod bowl of the\r\nChow princely dynasty, date 812 B. C. This was about the date when\r\nJeroboam recovered Damascus from Israel. When Confucius was a boy of\r\ntwelve, and already deep in his study of history, Cyrus the Elder had\r\ncaptured ancient Babylon and founded the Persian empire. It is quite\r\nprobable that the old Hia, Shang and Chou kings (2200 B. C. onward)\r\nleft their records, as the contemporary Egyptians and Babylonians\r\ndid, in brick tablets, but those tablets, being made of non-adhesive,\r\nfibrous loess mud of the present Shensi and Shansi provinces, soon\r\ncrumbled. It was a different thing when centuries later, the Chinese\r\nkings, having traveled farther south, employed better potters to use\r\nthe more adhesive clays of the present Kiangsi province. The Hia kings\r\nof what is now Shensi province reigned when the giant sequoia evergreen\r\ntrees of California were seedlings 4010 years ago.\r\n\r\nChinese bronzes date back as far as the imperial Chou dynasty (1120\r\nB. C.) which instituted the sacrifices and ancestor worship, and a few\r\nmajestically simple bronze tripods, elemental monsters and sacrificial\r\nvessels date back to the Shang dynasty 1800 B. C. These tripods are\r\nsimilar to those that Homer describes in the ninth book of _The Iliad_,\r\n2500 B. C. The oldest bronzes are, of course, noble and plain in\r\ndesign, the warmer, richer art of Buddhism coming in at a far later\r\ndate, and bringing in the innovation of the human figure, flowers and\r\nincense burners. The Natural History Museum at New York has precious\r\ncollections of the old mortuary bronzes of the Chou dynasty referred\r\nto in Professor Parker’s illuminating work on the days of Confucius.\r\nBronze vases, goblets, censers, mirrors, tablets, baskets, bells, some\r\nof them studded, are in the collection which dates as far back as 1800\r\nB. C. Chinese form has been persistent, its ornamentation progressive.\r\nWhen we are looking at these bronzes, we should realize that they\r\nwere fashioned by men contemporary with Homer. The oldest tombs were\r\nin Turkestan, Kansu and Shensi provinces, lying alongside the path of\r\nthe primeval emigration along the Tarim’s banks from Eden. In various\r\narticles I have instanced the similarity between old Greek and old\r\nChinese designs. The dragon was used in art designs and considered a\r\nsacred Jovian portent by the Homerian Greeks who were camped before\r\nTroy, B. C. 2500. In anthropological customs, Pope relates that the\r\nHomerian Greeks of the Euboea tribe, drawn up before Troy’s walls, 2500\r\nB. C., shaved their foreheads but left the hair on the back of their\r\nheads to grow long, like the present Manchus.\r\n\r\nThe new bronze portrait statue of Li Hung Chang at the Sicawei Gardens,\r\nShanghai, is unusual, and marks a new era in memorials in China, pailoo\r\narches and tablets having formerly been erected. True, there are many\r\nfanciful statues to Buddha and Confucius, and one to Marco Polo in the\r\nTemple of the Five Hundred Genii at Canton, but they are rather to be\r\nconsidered as effigies. In Tibet, they erect engraved, square stone\r\nmonuments, a figure of Buddha being cut into three of the top panels,\r\nrepresenting the past, present and future Buddha. A horned roof, with a\r\nlittle central pagoda covers the monument. These strikingly symmetrical\r\nmonuments are erected on high places along the mountain passes. The\r\nBuddhists cut gigantic figures of the god into cliffs, bushes serving\r\nas hair, and grass as eyebrows. Notable among these are the colossal\r\ncliff Buddhas at Kiating and Yung Hsien in Szechuen province. Old caves\r\nand cave-temples are generally in proximity with these images.\r\n\r\nIn Szechuen province, the piers of bridges have a stone dragon as a\r\nterminal, the head looking up-stream, and across the bridge, the tail\r\npointing down-stream. The proportions are beautiful and the effect\r\ndelightful. The best known and most beautiful camel’s back bridge in\r\nthe empire is at Wan Hsien at the head of the Yangtze gorges. Stone\r\nsteps mount up the arch, which is crowned with a beautiful house of\r\nblue stucco. The house is used as a rest place, and a restaurant\r\nThese bridges show how much the Chinese understood of engineering and\r\nalso that they were good masons. In the caves along the Min River\r\nin Szechuen province, pottery coffins have been found, dating back\r\nprevious to the Christian era, and showing that the early Chinese of\r\nthe Chou dynasty did not bring all the civilization of China with\r\nthem, but found many arts among the aborigines. At Ning Hsia, an oasis\r\ncity in the horn of Kansu province, is a peculiar pagoda where the\r\njoylessness of the north has cut the curling ten galleries down to mere\r\nridges, and roofed the eleven stories with a mere turban roof. Each\r\nstory has Roman windows, except the top, which has circular windows.\r\nThe architecture shows Mohammedan influence over these Buddhists,\r\nand the structure, with that at Liangchow in the same province, is\r\nexceedingly unique in so ornate a land of up-curling roofs, carved\r\nscreens, and overhanging galleries. While the Chinese never build\r\nfences, the Manchus, of Manchuria, construct a curious palisade\r\ncomposed of crosses, one end of which is stuck in the ground. The\r\nwhole of the Grand Canal was crossed by many thousands of beautiful\r\nmarble bridges, erected during the Sung dynasty. Many of them still\r\nremain, with their great beauty of aspiring arch, balustrade, carving\r\nand anchorage. At Sui Fu, on the upper Yangtze, is a temple remarkable\r\nnot for its size, but for the proportion of its galleries and roof,\r\nthe cornices of which curl upward violently at great width from the\r\nwalls. The temple is met by steps that climb up the mountain side\r\nfrom the great river. The walls too, with their panels, frieze and\r\nbalustrade, are interesting, but the design of the roof is an artistic\r\ntriumph, equaled only by the Loong Wah Temple which is photographed as\r\na frontispiece in my book, _The Chinese_. It is this sweeping boldness\r\nand generosity of curve which should be copied in roofs and galleries\r\nin the new Chinese architecture, which lovers of the old China\r\nearnestly recommend.\r\n\r\nMany of the poorer huts of Pechili province are built of clay poured\r\naround a reinforcing of kaoliang stalks. Sometimes tiles are set in\r\nthe clay roof, which is very heavy, and in the rainy season, it often\r\nfalls in on the tenant. In Kiangsu province the thatching is made of\r\nreeds. Of course improvements are often designed, and they attempt to\r\nmake a cement or chunam by mixing burnt lime and stone in the clay. The\r\nvery poor, however, really live in mud burrows like the fox, whether\r\nthe mud is made into a hut, or the dwelling is cut as a cave in the\r\nloess hills of Shensi and Shansi provinces. The Manchurian and northern\r\nPechili style of architecture is severe and strong, but it has its\r\nsimple beauties. A Buddhist temple not far from Shan Hai Kwan is a\r\ngood example. A plain brick and stucco wall, the height of the eaves\r\nof the buildings, surrounds the compound. It is broken by a fort-gate,\r\nwith a Roman arched doorway. The tiled roofs of the fort and temple\r\ncurl up only slightly. A few high pine trees, branching out only near\r\nthe top, tower like nature’s banners over the temple, which is matched\r\nto the austere lives and buildings of the dwellers in the north. The\r\nproportions throughout are nobly and chastely balanced in accord with\r\nthe architectural influence of the stern Great Wall throughout this\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nAt the Edinburgh Mission Conference of the nations in 1908, the Chinese\r\npleaded for the preservation of their architecture. Too great praise\r\ncan not be given the British for their taste in occupying a Chinese\r\npalace as legation headquarters at Peking. Many missions, every foreign\r\nbusiness house, nearly every foreign college, the government itself\r\nin its new buildings, even the kindred Japanese, and nearly every\r\nforeign legation, are all housed in an ugly adaptation of a Renaissance\r\nbuilding with verandas. The fashion came from Singapore and Hongkong,\r\nbut Hongkong gets some picturesqueness out of the style because that\r\ncolonial city has a mountain to terrace it on. The ventilation and\r\nlight are poor; the roof is hideous. There is one foreign architect\r\nwhose soul will never escape from the purgatory of bad architects. He\r\ndesigned for the Honan Assembly a hall at Kaifong which is Moorish\r\nin general design; the roof is a Roman dome; the arches are Gothic;\r\nand the screens are Chinese. The Japanese do not bring their own\r\nbeautiful buildings, like those gems, the incomparable Horiuji pagoda\r\nand monastery, Yakushiji pagoda; and the shrine of Ieasu at Nikko, to\r\nChina, and they do not copy or adapt any of the tens of thousands of\r\nChinese gems. They often build a ponderous, ugly, dark, Renaissance\r\nbuilding like the Japanese consulate at Shanghai, costly enough but\r\nunrepresentative.\r\n\r\nSt. John’s University (American Episcopal), of Shanghai, has made the\r\nlaudable concession of putting a Chinese roof on its valuable foreign\r\nbuildings. The eaves have a slight Chinese up-turn, but there is little\r\nof Chinese ornament in apron, ridge, column, double roof, or pagoda\r\nspire here and there. However, America, nearly always the leader in\r\nsympathy with the Chinese, has here made a beginning in saving China’s\r\npeerless architecture and art. At Kweiyang, the capital of Kweichou,\r\nthe French have erected a notable pagoda church, which concedes to\r\nChinese canons a five-story pagoda entrance, and the rear façade is\r\nformed as a pailoo with five roofs. With the same idea the British\r\narchitect has placed on the costly Renaissance “Audience Hall”, of\r\nBangkok, three ornate Burmese pagoda spires. As Greece stands for\r\nsimplicity and line, China stands for richness, curve and color. She\r\nshould not die, if according to Keats, “a thing of beauty is a joy\r\nforever.” Ruskin insisted in his famous lectures to artistic Edinburgh\r\nthat the salient feature of a building was the _roof_, and that there\r\nadornment should be rich, like a woman’s hair, or hat, her “crown of\r\nglory”. This rule, perhaps indirectly, he took from the Chinese, who\r\nfrom the buried centuries have undeviatingly been faithful to it. The\r\n_Assembly Herald_ of the American Presbyterian Church, January, 1912,\r\npage twenty-seven, illustrates a gem of modern Chinese architecture. It\r\nis a chapel built by a native elder in his simple but beautiful faith.\r\nOn each side of the entrance there is a rich tile grille that relieves\r\nthe plain façade. Under the eaves is another beautiful grille that\r\nrelieves the plain surface. Over the door is a heavy tile canopy with\r\ncharacteristic up-curling points. The tile roof is peaked and might\r\nhave been more up-curling at the eaves in the beautiful, characteristic\r\nChinese style. The apron under the eaves is richly carved. The Chinese\r\nstill have a strong rich grasp of beauty, when they are encouraged to\r\ndevelop their architecture.\r\n\r\nIt is not the custom in stores, temples or homes to keep curios, silks,\r\netc., on view. They are all wrapped in paper, and kept in boxes or\r\ncupboards. When a trusted guest arrives, there is an exciting scene as\r\nthe treasures are unpacked and revealed to admiring eyes. China has\r\nalways had court painters, a notable one in the reign of the Empress\r\nDowager Tse Hsi being Li Shih Chuan. He was a believer in joy, and\r\ndeveloped the more human aspects of the countenance. He was a master in\r\npainting fine gowns, dainty embroideries and rich furniture. Portrait\r\npaintings are not common, but in the Yangtze provinces some are to be\r\nseen. They are in water color and painted on screens. Actors carry an\r\nenormous bamboo or ivory tusk, on which is engraved or painted their\r\nrepertoire. The giver of a feast selects from this the plays which he\r\nwishes to have performed for his guests. The Chinese manufacture a hard\r\nwall-paper, similar to what we call Lincrusta Walton and use on the\r\nwalls of our parlor cars and saloons of steamships. The mold is of hard\r\nwood, on which the sharp design is carefully chiseled _en relievo_. The\r\nblotter-like bamboo paper composition is hammered on this mold, then\r\ntaken off and sun-dried. Sizing is applied. Afterward the design and\r\nfinal Ningpo or Szechuen rhus-nut varnishing is added. This paper is\r\ndamp proof, which is an important quality in so humid a climate.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese of Queens Road, Hongkong, made me two bamboo trunks that\r\nhave served me on a trip around the world, and are strong enough to\r\nmake several more. They are remarkable in five important points,\r\nelasticity, lightness, strength, resistance to dampness, and cheapness\r\nin purchase price and transportation cost. Travelers and explorers\r\nbemoan the fact that excess baggage charges cost them almost as much\r\nas passenger fares. This problem the wonderful Chinese solved with\r\nthese remarkable trunks. The framework is of strong bamboo, on which a\r\ntough rattan and bamboo envelope is wound. This is lined with soldered\r\nzinc, and covered with strong canvas, and for serviceability in the\r\nfive important points mentioned, the iron and leather trunks can not\r\ncompare. Go to the Chinese, thou traveler, and be wise! Many of the\r\nchairs used at Tientsin have a dome-top, with curious scale design\r\nand knob, and are therefore more Burmese than Chinese in design. The\r\nchairs of Hongkong are strictly flat-topped. Jade is green, pink and\r\ncrystal, and retains a soapy glisten. Jades buried in tombs as mortuary\r\nornaments, however, acquire a brown smoky tinge, and the distinction\r\nshould be made in assorting collections at museums. The Bishop\r\ncollection of art jades, and the Peters collection of tomb jades in the\r\nMetropolitan Museum of Art, New York, are deservedly world famous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright, 1913, The Bobbs-Merrill Company.\r\n\r\nOne of the most ornate pagodas in China, near Shanghai.

Rich brown and gold rugs are also frequently made,\r\nthe centers of weaving being Tientsin, Nanking, Hangchow, Canton, etc.\r\nThe most accessible places where specimens are shown are the large\r\nmuseums. The yellow rugs are used in China in connection with the red\r\ntile floorings, and the brown rugs are used often upon blue-tiled\r\nfloorings, so that if one would catch the true Chinese ensemble, a\r\ncolored crash must be used in connection with the rugs. Some critics\r\nare hasty in declaring that a Chinese rug is glaring when they place\r\na yellow rug on a yellow floor! Chinese rugs were made generally for\r\ntemples, imperial and viceregal yamens, mandarins’ yamens, and guild\r\nhalls, as the designs often reveal. Rugs exist which were woven as long\r\nago as the reign of the native Ming kings, fifteenth century. Other\r\nrugs date from the Kang Hi and Chien Lung reigns of the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries. Temple rugs five by eight feet, or a little over,\r\ncome from Buddhist monasteries. The ground, as one would expect, is\r\norange, ornamented with clouds, water, figures of Buddha or his mother,\r\nKun Yam, and the zodiac. Imperial Manchu rugs employ the Manchu dragon.\r\nEach rug differs slightly, as the artist trusted to his eye alone in\r\nfollowing the pattern which hung over his head.\r\n\r\nChina is almost depleted of her ceramic treasures. The Anglo-French\r\nexpedition of 1860 under Lord Wolseley destroyed the Emperor Hien\r\nFung’s summer and other palaces near Peking. Some of the allies of 1900\r\nlooted Peking itself. The Manchus in the 1911–12 revolution sold the\r\nPeking, Mukden and Jehol palace treasures. The collection of the Roman\r\nBishop of Peking, Monsieur Favier, gathered during a long life, was\r\nsold in New York in 1912. The Taiping rebellion of 1854 swept bare the\r\npottery province of Kiangsi, and the distress following the 1911–12\r\nrevolution and the floods of 1910–11–12 sent the hidden treasures of\r\nthe Yangtze and Hwei River provinces to the block. An artist of the\r\nKing Teh Ching potteries would now have to resort to Occidental museums\r\nto find his models of cloisonné and champlevé enamels studded with\r\nprecious stones; yellow and red Lang Yao monochromes of inimitable\r\npurity; Ku Hsu Hsuan translucent glass; Kang Hi hawthorn, ginger,\r\nand peach-bloom vases, round and square; Yung Cheng landscape and\r\nfish vases; flaming jars of the royal Mings; egg shell, rose, green,\r\npeony, medallion, dragon, lion vases and plaques of Yung Cheng and\r\nChien Lung periods; the joyous, finely finished pottery of the Kang Hi\r\n(seventeenth century period); the rugged, strong, stern work of the\r\ntenth century; strutting camels, grinning griffins, spirited horses;\r\nthe elegant, soft Ming work; the square, flower-covered, green and\r\nyellow vases of the sixteenth century; bulging vases of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, with green decoration on a blue ground, as fine as a mixture\r\nof emeralds and amethysts; awful gods and funny men stepping about in\r\npriceless porcelain. It was not a slight price that to attain political\r\nliberty China had to lose her artistic soul. More fortunate Japan never\r\nhad to pay this price, though she had little art and architecture to\r\nlose as compared with the rich and glorious treasures of vast China.\r\nA remarkable catalogue of Chinese porcelains with two hundred and\r\nfifty-four gorgeously colored plates was written by Messrs. Gorer and\r\nBlacker and published by Quaritch, London, in 1912.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt, even so late, to save China’s art from the foreigner,\r\nthe public-spirited Tze Tsan Tai, of Hongkong, a collector himself,\r\nproposes the establishing of national museums to preserve at least the\r\npaintings of China that are notable for their graphic quality, color,\r\nhumor and love of nature. The most famous schools were in the Sung,\r\nYuan and Ming dynasties, and Mr. Tze’s collection, which he proposes to\r\ngive to the cause, includes collections from many other schools also.\r\nIt would be better to open at first museums at Hongkong and Shanghai,\r\nand then at Peking, Nanking, Hankau, etc. Some of the names of the\r\nartists can be secured in Paleologue’s _L’Art Chinois_, Owen Jones’\r\n_Chinese Ornament_, Dyer Ball’s _Things Chinese_, and E. F. Penellosa’s\r\n_Epochs of Chinese Art_.\r\n\r\nChinese temple and house furniture is made of teak. This wood does not\r\ngrow in China, but in Siam, Java, Ceylon and the Philippines, the main\r\nsource of supply being the afforested belt of Northern Siam. The tree\r\nis an upland one. It is barked or girdled and allowed to die. After two\r\nyears the tree is felled, the exposure killing off the small branches\r\nand developing the oils which help in giving the extraordinary life\r\nof the wood. The government does not permit trees of under six and\r\none-half feet girth to be felled. The Chinese of Canton particularly\r\ncarve the wood in its rich red color, and they also stain it ebon\r\nblack. Another desirable quality in the Orient is that the wood resists\r\nthe white ant. The woodwork and furniture of the palatial Hongkong Club\r\nis teak, and many of Hongkong’s, Canton’s, Shanghai’s, Manila’s and San\r\nFrancisco’s palatial residences and public buildings and yachts now\r\nuse the wood. Hard as it is, the Chinese seem to prefer to saw it by\r\nhand even in Hongkong. They tilt the immense logs on end, and one man\r\nworks under the log, and one stands on the log, the dust being dragged\r\nupward by their contrary cut saws, which are designed to save the eyes\r\nof the under-man. The natural oil in the wood prevents driven nails or\r\nbolts from rusting, and is therefore valuable in ship-sheathing. It is\r\nthe most durable wood known. The teak piles of West End, Hongkong, and\r\nKowloon over on the mainland, are a unique sight. Water-buffaloes are\r\nused to drag up the immense timbers.\r\n\r\nA Chinese proverb is, “Speed for a horse, but a slow race for a good\r\njeweler”. The German machinery-stamping jeweler has not yet reached the\r\nOrient with his machines, though his products imitate even the Chinese\r\nideograph-buckles. One of their humorous proverbs is, “He thought he\r\npainted a tiger, but only a dog waged his tail at the likeness”, and\r\nthis is about the relationship between the Chinese and the German\r\nproducts. Wherever you buy, remember the artist can put his soul and\r\nhis taste only into what he makes by hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\nSOCIOLOGICAL CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen America was as yet undiscovered, and Europe was largely a\r\nforest inhabited by hunting tribes, China had taken up an advanced\r\nposition on sociology. She has long been the world’s clearest and\r\nbravest economical thinker, from whom even Germany has consciously or\r\nunconsciously copied, and for thousands of years she has followed a\r\nthorough civil service in political appointments. It is not surprising\r\ntherefore that Doctor Sun Yat Sen, the organizer of the revolution\r\nof 1911–12, the first president of republican China, and the leading\r\neconomist of the race, enunciated himself as follows on April 5, 1912:\r\n“I have finished the political revolution and now will commence the\r\ngreatest social revolution in the world’s history. The abdication of\r\nthe Manchus is only the beginning of a greater development, and the\r\nfuture policy of the republic will be in the direction of socialism.\r\nI am an ardent admirer of Henry George, whose ideas are practicable\r\non the virgin soil of China, as compared with their impracticability\r\nin Europe or the United States, where the money is controlled by the\r\ncapitalists. I have the full consent of the new republican government\r\nto start a propaganda immediately, whereby the railroads, mines, and\r\nsimilar industries, will be controlled by the government. The single\r\ntax system, and as far as possible, free trade, will be adopted.”\r\n\r\nShang, a minister of the Tsin clan of Confucius’ time--the age\r\nof courageous statesmen--said: “To restore balance in the state,\r\nand remove the dangerous discontent of the poor, renew taxes on\r\nthe privileged classes.” The Chinese predate all that we claim in\r\nAmerica, Britain and Germany as the modern discovery of the formulæ\r\nof sociology, economics, commerce, taxes and tariffs, and their aim\r\nis always toward free trade, repression of monopoly, opportunity for\r\nthe ordinary man, who, instead of the privileged, represents the\r\nimportance of a state, and the necessity of the greater punishment\r\nof the rich than the poor for the same offense, because hunger and\r\nself-preservation do not drive the rich to crime. Under the ancient\r\ncriminal code, the hsiang lao (village head) under penalty of the\r\nbamboo, must compel all available land to be cultivated, not only that\r\ngovernment may receive taxes, but that famine may be averted. The\r\nChinese, Koun Tze, as early as B. C. 100, wrote: “The more horses that\r\nare put to the chariots of the rich, the more those who are poor will\r\nhave to walk.”\r\n\r\n“The more the houses of the rich are vast and magnificent, the more\r\nthose of the poor will be small and miserable.”\r\n\r\n“The more the tables of the rich are covered with dainties, the more\r\npeople there will be reduced to plain rice.”\r\n\r\n“At all costs, government should secure to all, all the necessities of\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\nThis last sentence is worthy of being linked with the immortal epigram\r\nin Lincoln’s Gettysburg address.\r\n\r\nOther notable economic writers were Tsien Tche and Leang Tsien, but\r\ntowering above them all for adaptability to the convictions and crying\r\nnecessities of our day was Wang Ngan Shih, 1069 A. D., a Rooseveltian\r\nstatesman of the Sung dynasty, whose capital was the present Kaifong.\r\nRemember that this statesman-author wrote when William the Conqueror\r\nwas putting England under the yoke of feudalism, which hated the\r\nprinciples of liberty. Wang taught partly as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The first duty of government is to secure plenty and relaxation for\r\nthe common people.\r\n\r\n2. The state should take possession of all important resources and\r\nbecome the main and dictating employer in commerce, industry and\r\ntransportation, with the view of preventing the working classes being\r\nground to the dust by the monopolizing rich.\r\n\r\n3. Government tribunals should fix the local prices of provisions and\r\nmerchandise.\r\n\r\n4. The rich shall pay all taxes; the small owner shall pay nothing as\r\nlong as he remains small.\r\n\r\n5. Old age pensions.\r\n\r\n6. The state to insure work for workmen.\r\n\r\n7. The state to assign land, distribute seed and direct sowing, so that\r\nthere shall neither be cornering of food by the rich, nor lack of food\r\nfor the poor.\r\n\r\n8. Destruction of usurers.\r\n\r\n9. Confiscation of large and criminally-won estates; that is,\r\nretroactive laws and restitution, instead of “Go and sin no more, but\r\nkeep what you got by former sins.”\r\n\r\nThe Boswell of Confucius in the Ta Hio (Great Study) writes: “If those\r\nwho govern states only think of amassing riches for their personal\r\nuse, they will infallibly attract toward them depraved men, and these\r\ndepraved men will really govern the state. The administration of\r\nthese unworthy ministers will call down the chastisements of heaven,\r\nand also excite the vengeance of the aggrieved people. The riches of\r\nthose who have the honor to govern states should rather be justice and\r\nequity, and not only talk of justice and equity.” Is this not excellent\r\nstatesmanship, even if written in China long before the Christian era?\r\n\r\nChina’s love of peace was inculcated brilliantly by Lao Tse (604\r\nB. C.) in these words: “The least glorious peace is preferable to the\r\nmost brilliant successes of war. The most splendid victory is but the\r\nlight from a conflagration.” The Ancients said: “Render no funeral\r\nhonors to conquerors; receive them with tears and cries in memory of\r\nthe homicides they have committed, and let the monuments of their\r\nvictories be surrounded with the tombs of those whose death they\r\nbrought about.” Confucius, a practical statesman, fifty-three years\r\nlater, ineffectually combated this philosophy with these words: “They\r\nwho discuss by diplomacy should always have the support of a military\r\nbacking”; that is, the mailed fist and the soft word! The feudal\r\nsystem began to totter in China in B. C. 250, under the reign of the\r\nemperor-builder of the Great Wall, Tsin Chih Hwang-Ti. The classical\r\nexaminations gave it the death blow in A. D. 600. With its martial\r\naccessory, the feudal system continued in Japan, which tolerated no\r\ndemocratic examinations for office, until the very late date of 1869\r\nA. D., thus lasting there the longest in the world, for it had died in\r\nEngland eight centuries earlier. Such was the beneficent effect of the\r\nfamous classical examinations and civil service in old China.\r\n\r\nThe most brilliant maxim on sociology ever written is Chinese:\r\n\r\n “Gold is tested by fire:\r\n  Man is tested by gold.”\r\n\r\nOn this subject of hardships, Mencius himself wrote, in 315 B. C.:\r\n“When Heaven (Tien) is about to confer a responsible office on any\r\nman, it first exercises his mind with suffering and his sinews and\r\nbones with toil. It exposes his body to hunger and subjects him to\r\nextreme poverty. It confounds his bravest undertakings. By all these\r\nmethods it stimulates his mind, hardens his courage and increases his\r\nadaptability.” China was the first country to establish a Price Board,\r\nnow recommended by all political parties in America for dealing with\r\nmonopolies until real competition can be again set up. Salt production\r\nis a government monopoly. The dealer must buy from the government and\r\nsell a fixed quantity at a fixed price in a fixed district. The justice\r\nthat the government regulates is that the dealer may not adulterate\r\nand may not charge an unreasonable profit. If the cost of production\r\nis high, the people profit, because the government will not need to\r\ncollect high taxes in other ways. There is no chance for a crowd of\r\ndrone-middlemen to get away with immense profits, or for private\r\nmonopolists to lay a whole people under economic slavery. This is the\r\nChinese theory. In many parts of Eastern Szechuen every farm has its\r\nlittle salt well with bamboo wheel and men treaders. The salt is sold\r\nto the government at a fixed price, about two and one-half cents a\r\npound. The Chinese say: “Why do your trusts now want consolidation?\r\nThe divisions of Europe, by the competition of various ambitions,\r\nhave made Europe bright and progressive. America’s trusts, by making\r\nall things one, will produce decay of genius, invention, liberty and\r\nindividualism.” A Chinese reformer had written to a rich bribe-taker\r\nand bribe-giver for work in one of the industries which he controlled,\r\nand he also endeavored to sell to the rich man a copy of one of his\r\nbooks. Chided in later years with seeking employment in his earlier\r\nyears from a man whom he had later cause to criticize, the reformer\r\nsaid: “The devil is king and has usurped the seats of employment; yet,\r\nalthough he is devil, he owes me employment. A man’s right to work and\r\nto retain free opinion are inalienable, and a government, in granting\r\na monopoly, can not sell such rights of the individual; they are a\r\nperpetual lien on the monopoly.” Intelligent municipal philanthropy\r\nhas not been unknown of late years. I will instance an occurrence at\r\nLanchow, a city on the Yellow River (Hoang-Ho) in far western Kansu\r\nprovince. In the fall of 1911 large numbers of people had become\r\na charge upon the city on account of summer floods and consequent\r\nfamine. By the end of August the moat of the city had become dry. The\r\nauthorities roofed and partitioned this trench into many houses so as\r\nto shelter hundreds of vagrant families.\r\n\r\nChina has specialized in localization, or home rule. Even in charities\r\nthis operates. No province, district or city encourages any other\r\ndistrict’s imposing its public charges upon it. To illustrate, we shall\r\nsay that your Chinese interpreter and his wife have accompanied you\r\nfrom Amoy to Chingtu City. The interpreter dies. If you do not send\r\nthe woman back to Amoy, she will report to the Amoy Guild in Chingtu.\r\nThat guild will subscribe and send her on her way as far as Chungking,\r\nwhere the Amoy Guild will subscribe and send her in care of the Amoy\r\nGuild at Hankau. Eventually, to her great pleasure no doubt, she will\r\nreach her people in Amoy. A widow is not molested on her travels; her\r\npersistence in widowhood and desire not to sell herself, either as a\r\nsecond wife, slave or strumpet, are highly respected. She would not\r\nbe encouraged, however, nor would she desire to remain in Chingtu,\r\nwhere, being a stranger, she would be unable to secure employment. The\r\nsame system would operate inversely if a Chingtu woman were, through\r\nmisfortune, stranded in far-away Amoy. The Chingtu Guilds in Amoy,\r\nFuchau, Shanghai, Hankau, etc., would relay her onward to her home,\r\nwhere she would be more likely to secure work, remarriage, or properly\r\nbe a charge upon her own community. A criminal is treated in the same\r\nway. He is driven on toward his own community, which can elect whether\r\nthey desire to board him in jail at public expense or make life so\r\nuncomfortable for him by corporal punishment that he will select a\r\nvirtuous existence in preference to crime.\r\n\r\nThe community, closely related in cousinship, makes the family clan\r\nresponsible for the misfortunes and crimes of its members. If a\r\ncriminal breaks the law, the law does not bother itself long with the\r\ncriminal. By one fell swoop it makes the clan take the criminal’s\r\ncourse in hand for the rest of his life. There is much talk of revising\r\nChina’s code, the slogan being the American maxim: “Crime is personal.”\r\nChina’s code in this particular does not need revision. It saves the\r\nstate much expense; it is more effective also in real permanent reform.\r\nIt is the most scientific system of reform ever invented, and beats\r\nall farming out of criminals, parole, coals of kindness, pellets of\r\nadvice, pardons, abolishing of stripes, preachings, coddlings, threats,\r\nmusic-treatment, trepannings, religious advice, hypnotic treatment,\r\nflowers, sentiment, visits of the jail angel, etc.! Don’t whip the\r\ncriminal alone; whip the criminal’s six elder brothers and cousins\r\nbecause they must have been lax in instruction and watch. They will\r\nsee that never again will they suffer for the scamp’s dereliction!\r\nThe Chinese say, “Don’t whip your trusts; whip your electorate! They\r\nwill forever after see that the trusts do not break bounds; they will\r\nwatch the charters.” Guilt then is not personal; it is communal. We\r\nare our brother’s keeper, and if we allow him to meet with misfortune\r\nor do wrong, we must suffer with him. How quickly would the Chinese\r\nscientific system of localization and communism correct and limit\r\ncrime, poverty and misfortune.\r\n\r\nBritish vessels trading in China are manned entirely with Chinese\r\ncrews. During the dock strike in Britain, in August, 1911, the dockers\r\nrefused to handle the cargoes of vessels which employed Chinese.\r\nChina then entered a claim for damages, because her citizens were\r\nill-treated, and the Chinese guilds threatened to embarrass the\r\nBritish vessels when they returned to load in the East. The writer\r\nhas had some experience with such a situation in Hongkong, where the\r\nBritish government exercises a strong hand in preventing the spread\r\nof stevedore strikes. The use of the boycott in China calls for\r\nspecial study. In no land is it more in use. It is a powerful weapon\r\nfor securing justice when laws and diplomacy fail either because of\r\nweakness or venalty. China, of course, has no navy to support her\r\ndiplomacy. Recent boycotts in China have been the following: In 1904\r\nthe merchant guilds of Canton and Hongkong desired to support, among\r\nother things, China’s protest against the American Exclusion Act. A\r\nboycott of American goods and American ships was ordered, and the loss\r\nto American trade ran into the millions. In 1908 the Japanese landed\r\narms for pirates in Macao, South China, and with the powerful Japanese\r\nnavy compelled the Chinese officials who had seized the smuggling\r\nsteamer _Tatsu Maru_ to give her up. The Chinese guilds of Hongkong and\r\nCanton then boycotted Japanese ships, causing the Toyo Kisen Kaisha a\r\nloss of millions in earnings and a deficit of $300,000 for the year’s\r\noperation. Japan probably would have again declared war on China with\r\nthis excuse if she had not feared America’s naval support of China’s\r\ngeneral cause under the Hay “non-partition of China” policy. The loss\r\nto Japan ran into many millions. In 1910 the same body of Chinese\r\nguilds boycotted American trade as a reply to the long and costly\r\ndetainment of Chinese on Angel Island, San Francisco.\r\n\r\nWe shall hear more and more of international boycotts by the Chinese,\r\nand should study the question. They hover on the borderland of justice,\r\nand are recommended by many of the women’s clubs of America in dealing\r\nwith monopolies. They will be misunderstood. They will produce much\r\nannoyance and trouble. They are mighty weapons in the hands of the\r\nclannish Chinese. Many fortunes of millionaires were really produced\r\nby boycotts. For instance, Mr. B controls the X railway, which latter\r\nhas used the Y railway as a connection for freight. Mr. B wants to buy\r\nthe Y railway for a song. He diverts all the freight he can to the Z\r\nrailway, and when the Y railway fails, he buys its stock for a song.\r\nThen he restores the freight of the X railway to the Y railway, whose\r\nearnings rise and make his fortune, which is immediately entrenched\r\nunder nonretroactive and nonrestitution laws. In China the boycott is\r\nonly used by the guilds for patriotic purposes. Of course, we traders\r\nin America and Britain object because we suffer, but looking with\r\nChinese eyes and with a world-economical vision at the matter, we must\r\nadmit that the Chinese guilds are not ignoble or selfish and that\r\ntheir use of the boycott is a mighty diplomatic weapon. It has humbled\r\nJapan without the use of a soldier or a thirteen-inch broadside. By\r\nthreatening a boycott, Wu Ting Fang and the Shanghai Assembly at the\r\ndarkest hour of the republican revolution, prevented certain nations\r\nfrom making a loan to the imperialists, which was the most brilliant\r\nand potential move of the revolution. It really won for the southern\r\ncause, the military capture of Nanking following as a matter of\r\ncourse. Let Japan, Russia and others beware how they take advantage of\r\nChina, whether in Manchuria, the Yangtze provinces, Shangtung, Yunnan,\r\nSzechuen or other provinces, or territories like Tibet, Mongolia and\r\nTurkestan; the Chinese guilds with their boycott are a sure refuge\r\nin time of trouble, back of any failing walls of arms, finance or\r\ndiplomacy.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the sociological proverbs of the Chinese:\r\n\r\n“The chain is as strong as its weakest ring, and a corporation is as\r\nmoral as its most corrupt director.”\r\n\r\n“Taking rocks away makes a smooth stream, as removing wrongs makes a\r\nplacid nation.”\r\n\r\n“We can’t all agree exactly, for many faces, many minds, and the ten\r\nfingers are not all of one length; but they are all useful.”\r\n\r\n“Money covers a multitude of sins.”\r\n\r\n“Fire will burn through anything, and money will get through anything.”\r\n\r\n“The deeper you go in your cave, the smaller seems your heaven.”\r\n\r\n“A living poor man is better than a dead rich man.”\r\n\r\n“Some have had a thousand years of sorrow in a hundred years of life.”\r\n\r\n“You may think you’re on the right way, but you lose nothing by asking.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t carve much on a rotten stick.”\r\n\r\n“Some dogs are so intent on chasing the rabbit that they don’t see the\r\ntiger chasing them.”\r\n\r\n“Right is the only might that lasts.”\r\n\r\n“Of all the fools the greatest is the miser. He breaks his back with\r\nthe burden which he carries when the goal is in sight.”\r\n\r\n“Before you beat an irresponsible dog for its howl, think of the\r\nmanners you owe to its master.”\r\n\r\n“If you would have a long twilight of life, you must begin old age\r\nearly.”\r\n\r\n“Riches may ornament a wall, but only virtue can adorn a person.”\r\n\r\n“The heart has one language the world over, but the tongues of men have\r\nmany languages.”\r\n\r\n“When you are rich the whole world is your cousin; when you are poor,\r\neven your cousin doesn’t know you.”\r\n\r\n“He who deserves an increase in his wage is a coward if he does not ask\r\nfor it.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a pretty mean traveler who destroys the bridge which has served\r\nhis purpose; there are other brother-travelers.”\r\n\r\n“With money you can yell like a lion; without it you must squeak like a\r\nmouse.”\r\n\r\n“There were two fools: one when he was poor thought of days of riches;\r\nthe other when he was rich never thought of days of poverty.”\r\n\r\n“A kind stranger at hand is better than a cold relative afar.”\r\n\r\n“Repentance is only good when it looks forward.”\r\n\r\n“Be hard on yourself and easy on your fellows.”\r\n\r\n“The same thing can be fact to a friend and fiction to a foe.”\r\n\r\n“Rough food is strongest, as rough wool is warmest.”\r\n\r\n“Emulation is only proper in charities.”\r\n\r\n“Charity is like smoking, hard to learn and hard to stop.”\r\n\r\n“Jewels in a pig’s nose and riches in a snob’s hand.”\r\n\r\n“He gives more who gives a penny to the poor than he who adds a fortune\r\nto the wealth of the rich.”\r\n\r\n“Those who rose from nothing lord it most.”\r\n\r\n“Get at the cause rather than attack the effect.”\r\n\r\n“A headlong hero is not so good as a timid man who knows just what he\r\nis after.”\r\n\r\n“If you would serve a fair master, work for yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Once books, art, music, poetry and gardening used to interest the men\r\nof China and the world; now it is the new age, when only food and power\r\nengage; is materialism progress?”\r\n\r\n“The best place to await your enemy is at the graveyard boundary, for\r\nhe must pass there at last.”\r\n\r\n“Another mouth at the table shrinks the bowl on the fire.”\r\n\r\n“You can only give a man a stone for bread once.”\r\n\r\n“The old boat is full of nails, and the old man is full of\r\nexperiences.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\nAWAKENED INTEREST IN AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\nThree recent manifestations, selected from many, will indicate the\r\nawakened interest in America in things Chinese and the New China. Like\r\nthe ostrich which pushed its head in the sand, and concluded that the\r\nworld that was not seen, did not exist, our stage has for centuries\r\npersisted in ignoring Sinim-histrionics. Now Chinese plays are not\r\nuncommon. One in particular is worthy of mention. William Winter,\r\nthe dean of the American critics, says of _The Daughter of Heaven_,\r\nplaying at the Century Theater, New York: “I have seen every important\r\nspectacle displayed in America during the last sixty years and I think\r\n_The Daughter of Heaven_ is superior to anything of the kind I ever\r\nsaw.” The Liebler Company state that it has cost them $100,000.00 to\r\nstage the play. How my eminent Thespian friends in old China will\r\nmarvel when they read this amount! For the same sum they would agree\r\nto give four thousand simultaneous plays in the four thousand walled\r\ncities of China! _Revenons à nos moutons._ There are eight gorgeous\r\nscenes, the exact detail of which the stage manager brought from Peking\r\nand Nanking, where he specially went for local color, and where the\r\nplay is laid. Scene one introduces a moving state sanpan boat, lighted\r\nby lanterns, as a setting for a beautiful tenor love song. Scene two\r\nshows the Manchu emperor’s room in the Peking palace. Scene three is\r\nof the Ming empress’ gardens at Nanking. This lovely scene is made\r\nrealistic by living flocks of sacred cranes and peacocks moving about\r\nthe stage. Scene four is the throne room of the Ming palace at Nanking,\r\na gorgeous representation of Chinese luxury such as we shall never\r\nsee again, now that the old royal China has passed away. Scene five\r\nis outside the pavilion of the Ming empress. Scene six, in contrast\r\nto previous gorgeousness, gives a somber Craig-like setting to the\r\nbattlements of Nanking, and all the remarkable modern art of the stage\r\nmanager is called into exercise to produce thrilling battle effects.\r\nScene seven is outside the Chien Men gate at Peking, executions taking\r\nplace, and all the daily life of the Manchus holding one spellbound by\r\nits accuracy. Scene eight is the Manchu throne room at Peking.\r\n\r\nNow, as to the plot and theme. Pierre Loti, the Orientalist, of course\r\nknows his China, for he fought in the relief of Peking, and I have\r\nrelated elsewhere in this volume, his unique pilgrimage to Angkor.\r\nJudith Gautier, his collaborator, knows the passionate human heart,\r\nas should the daughter of the famous romantic French poet, Theophile\r\nGautier. They have combined their skill to write a tragic Shakespearean\r\ntheme in a Chinese setting, but the human heart beats to the same pulse\r\nunder all colors of complexion. In short, the theme is as follows:\r\nAs there has been for three hundred years, in this play there is war\r\nbetween the Ming and Manchu races. Neither the beautiful young widow,\r\nthe Ming empress, nor the bachelor Manchu emperor, has been allowed by\r\nthe factionists of their respective parties to consider the national\r\nsuicide of race strife. The Manchu emperor resolves if possible to\r\ndo two things: to restrain in time his army which is attacking the\r\nMings, and in disguise personally to sue at Nanking for the hand of\r\nthe remarkable beauty, the Ming empress. He can not sue as a Manchu\r\nemperor; he knows the Ming empress has only too much cause to hate\r\nhis race. This worthy Romeo gains admittance to the audience chamber\r\nof the Ming empress, and his unusual address and fire carry away the\r\nforlorn empress’ heart, despite herself. He therefore has made the\r\npersonal conquest that could only be made on love’s unsupported basis,\r\nand he can afford to wait. In the meantime, the Manchu emperor’s real\r\ncharacter is discovered, but he escapes from the Ming palace. His\r\narmies, controlled by a cabal of generals, against his will, overcome\r\nthe Mings, kill the Ming empress’ adored little son and thus break\r\nher heart by destroying the dynasty. The Ming empress is captured by\r\nthe Manchu armies, and is brought to the Manchu emperor’s palace at\r\nPeking. There, in real character, the emperor sues for two things: for\r\nthe fruition of long deferred love, and for the patriotic union of the\r\nwarring races, in their marriage. In an awful scene of Homeric passion,\r\nthe Ming empress finally decides that too much blood has flowed between\r\nthe races for her selfishly to accept of the offered love and honor.\r\nShe sees the shades of the leaders of the great Ming race, led by\r\nher adored little son, and she decides in Oriental fashion, just as\r\nGeneral Nogi did, that duty calls her to follow them into the spirit\r\nland. The fiery hearted Manchu emperor stands by spellbound, for he\r\ncan not refute the Cathayan viewpoint, terrible as is his personal\r\nsuffering. He, too, must be willing to resign love. The Ming empress\r\nallows the Manchu emperor to escort her up the privileged central\r\nstairway reserved for royalty, to the widest and oldest throne of the\r\nhuman race, and for a hushed and glorious moment she sits radiant in\r\nthe place of power. The shades of her race, in clouds, approach and\r\nreproach her. She asks the emperor to return to her the pearl which\r\nshe gave him at Nanking, when, incognito, he was an accepted suitor.\r\nHe hands it to her, and she suddenly swallows it. The lines of Loti\r\nand Gautier draw out passion, as the French feel it, in this scene to\r\nthe limit of endurance, and to its exquisite pain the brave Anglo-Saxon\r\nacting of the actor Basil Gill adds a tempestuous power that is\r\nthrilling and convincing. When the Manchu emperor at last realizes\r\nthat the long silent Ming empress really sits dead on the throne, with\r\noverflowing emotion he strikes the great audience gong, and commands\r\n“to their knees and kotows” the host of viceroys and courtiers which\r\nenters; yes, though proud Manchus, they must, indeed, at last worship a\r\nMing empress. As I have pointed out in a chapter on the Portuguese in\r\nChina in my former book, _The Chinese_, such a scene is historically\r\ncorrect, for the frenzied king, Don Pedro, once placed the remains of\r\nhis beautiful bride, Ignez de Castro, who was murdered for love by his\r\nenemies, on the throne and compelled a before unwilling people, to pay\r\nhomage to her. Such is the deathless pride of true love, which mocks at\r\nfate even at the triumphant gates of death.\r\n\r\nWhat further shall be said of the acting of Basil Gill and Viola Allen.\r\nHe makes a brave, eloquent, manly lover, and his reading of the lines\r\ncan be heard round and full throughout the immense vault of the Century\r\nTheater. Viola Allen, as the Ming empress, touches with finished skill,\r\nevery chord of emotional acting, ever with burning fire and yet ever\r\nwith artistic control, which best brings the sympathetic tear. They\r\nboth ring the changes, both in what they suggest and in what they say,\r\non the noble chord: _Dulce et decorum est pro patriâ mori_. Compared\r\nwith the silly themes of some popular plays, what a wholesome one is\r\n_The Daughter of Heaven_. While there is little accurate Chinese music,\r\none wishes for more of it, as the Chinese throughout their plays use\r\nmore music than this play uses. The costumes, the most gorgeous ever\r\nseen, will be seen no more, as the old China has passed away. The\r\nLiebler Company have rendered a public service by staging so accurate,\r\nexpensive and educational a production, even if the actors repeatedly\r\nmispronounce the word “dynasty”! All Orientalists eagerly hope that the\r\npublic will avail themselves of the unique opportunity without delay,\r\nas there is no telling how long it will pay the producer to stage such\r\nan expensive play. No such spectacle will again be seen; the old China\r\nhas passed away, but it is caught and preserved in the amber in _The\r\nDaughter of Heaven_.\r\n\r\nAmong the Americans who deserve special credit for awakening an\r\ninterest in the New China should be mentioned Professor George H.\r\nBlakeslee, of the Department of History of Clark University, Worcester,\r\nMassachusetts, who for years has brought together a remarkable\r\nWorld’s Oriental Congress, the influence of which, in its published\r\nproceedings, etc., is rolling like a golden wheel around the globe,\r\nraying forth information, reconciliation, altruism and a forward\r\nAmericanism in the Orient, which is pro-Oriental and not incursive in\r\nany sense, in the opinion of the Orientals. At the last conference\r\nthere were thirty-six major addresses by specialists.\r\n\r\nIn closing this long volume, I would like to make a plea for China.\r\nAmerica should at once, without waiting for the “concert of Europe”\r\n(the “entangling alliances” which Washington prohibited) recognize\r\nthe new Chinese republic. For some time, with others, I have been\r\nworking on such a popular movement (as an American, and in no sense in\r\nthe pay of the Chinese government), writing to editors, authors and\r\ninfluential men, making addresses before learned and popular bodies,\r\nand ascertaining the opinions of Orientalists and Orientals. In public\r\nmeetings, I have found the sentiment of the American people to be\r\nentirely in favor. I wrote Ex-president Roosevelt in full on November\r\n25th, 1912, and the _Outlook_ of November 30, 1912 kindly published an\r\narticle in favor. The editor of the _Independent_ wrote me that they\r\nhad long been favorable. From my mail, I quote a few representative\r\nsentiments as follows:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Carnegie asks me to say that he is confident the republic will be\r\namong the first to recognize her sister republic.” The frank editor\r\nof the _North American Review_ writes: “We are in sympathy with your\r\nbelief that the time has come for America’s recognition of, and aid\r\nto, the new Chinese republic.” President Woodrow Wilson warmly wrote\r\nme from Bermuda: “You may be sure that my interest in the fortunes of\r\nChina is deep and permanent, and that the subject of recognition to\r\nwhich you call my attention will have my very serious and thoughtful\r\nconsideration.” The earnest Ex-treasurer of New York, Colonel Arthur\r\nMacArthur, editor of the influential Troy _Budget_, writes: “My paper\r\nwill continue to publish editorials and information in favor, and help\r\nto keep the movement prominently before the people.” The Worcester,\r\nMassachusetts, _Telegram_ has been most zealous. These are only samples\r\nof what the journals of the country are doing. Honorable Champ Clark,\r\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, writes me: “Individually I\r\nthink the Chinese republic ought to be recognized, but it has been\r\nsettled definitely in this country that the recognition of governments\r\nis an executive function.” Governor William Sulzer, the “father” of the\r\nfamous Sulzer Resolution which passed Congress, and which congratulated\r\nrepublican China on her new form of government, writes me: “You can\r\nrely on me to do all I can in the future, as in the past, to promote\r\nthe welfare of the Chinese republic.” Professor Blakeslee, of Clark\r\nUniversity, wrote me: “I want to tell you how much I appreciate\r\nall that you are doing to urge the early recognition of the Chinese\r\nrepublic. Have you thought of getting up another petition? I should be\r\nglad to sign it; so would Professor A. B. Hart, of Harvard University,\r\nand three-fourths of those who spoke at the Conference would sign it.”\r\n\r\nOf course there are some American “Manchus” and Laodiceans who are not\r\nin favor of the movement. At our last conference, at Clark University,\r\nof Orientalists recently arrived from the Orient, it was the general\r\nopinion that China should be helped by recognition, as miniature\r\nPortugal and South American republics, some of a moth’s life, have been\r\nhelped. Americans at the head of Chinese universities have told me:\r\n“We are heart and soul in favor.” The able Chinese officials educated\r\nin America, are passionate in their appeal for recognition by America\r\nnow, without waiting for the “concert of Europe” on this one point.\r\nWu Ting Fang, first foreign minister, and Wang Chung Wei, assistant\r\nforeign minister of the southern republicans, who won the battles of\r\nthe revolution, have been asking for America’s recognition since their\r\nfirst formal note of January, 1912. America has from the beginning\r\nwarmly appreciated the recognition by France, Spain, etc., of our\r\nstruggling republic in 1778, and leading Chinese ministers of state\r\nhave told me that China would have the same feeling if recognition is\r\nnot delayed till China is strong enough not to care so much as now.\r\nThe forceful idiom of one official, who smiled as he spoke, was: “You\r\nknow a beggar appreciates those favors the most which were given to him\r\nwhen he was a beggar, and not when he comes into his estate.” Are we\r\nwaiting till China gives a _quid pro quo_ in concessions or monopolies,\r\nor until some future election confirms the revolution, as though the\r\nbattles won were not a firmer expression of determination than even an\r\nelection, in which latter, enemies can cloud the issue. Americans have\r\nalmost entire charge of China’s higher education. The Panama Canal is\r\ngoing to bring trade intercourse with China very dose to the Eastern\r\nand Mississippi states of America. Secretary of State John Hay’s note\r\nto the powers in 1900, insisting for all time on the “integrity of\r\nChina,” really commits America now to the recognition of the republic.\r\nDelayed recognition is really encouraging certain powers in ignoring\r\nthe American altruistic doctrine of the “non-partition of China”. I\r\nrefer partially to the secession of parts of Chinese Turkestan and\r\nMongolia, largely caused by Monsieur Korostovetz’ intrusive visit in\r\nthe van of Cossacks to the heart of the latter dependency as late as\r\nDecember, 1912.\r\n\r\nMy idea is that generously helping China in republicanism, in\r\naccordance with the spirit and terms of Washington’s Farewell Address,\r\nwhich specified that Americans “should recommend their form of\r\ngovernment to the applause, affection and the _adoption_ of every\r\nnation,” will redound to the reputation of America in altruism.\r\nAmerica’s largest field for expansion in trade, educational and\r\nreligious influence, is in the New China, and the new progressive\r\nChinese, from long association with them, I can give my word, fully\r\ndeserve our unreserved admiration and friendship. As illustrating\r\nthe general opinion of American educationalists in China, I quote\r\nthe following letter from my warm friend Doctor J. E. Williams,\r\nVice-president of the great University of Nanking, China. Mr. Williams\r\nled in the movement whereby $430,000 was collected for China’s relief\r\nin the last flood and famine, and in the conservative administration of\r\nthat relief, and the model farm colonies which were later established\r\nfor the Chinese. “I am greatly interested in what you are doing to\r\nhasten America’s recognition of the republic. I am heart and soul in\r\nsympathy. I also agree with what you write, that there are many who are\r\nnot the friends of China. To any one who knows the inside facts, the\r\nlatter make no case at all against China, but to the people who do not\r\nknow, they put up a plausible story. Compare China’s advance after a\r\nyear of revolution and reform, with the efforts of our own forefathers\r\nto establish the American republic. After one year of enlistment,\r\nWashington’s soldiers were leaving him and returning to their homes.\r\nAs for financial credit, the original colonies had absolutely none. As\r\nfor trade and commerce, there was nothing worth mentioning. As for the\r\ndevelopment of popular education as a basis of republican government,\r\nthere were hardly the rudiments in evidence. As for the ability to open\r\nmines and railways as the _sine qua non_ of recognition, the original\r\nThirteen Colonies had not even dreamed of mines and railways. It is\r\nmy conviction that the Chinese are better prepared for republican\r\ngovernment, and have a better outlook for its achievement than the\r\nAmericans did any time up to the conclusion of the Civil War. I should\r\nbe pleased to cooperate in any way in your plans for influencing the\r\nleaders in bringing about early recognition. Your plan is capital in\r\nevery respect and I heartily concur.”\r\n\r\nGenerally, America has in the case of the South American republics,\r\netc., recognized governments after they have been established one year.\r\nThe year has long passed in the case of China. China has poor railroad\r\ncommunication and recognition should not be delayed until the suffrage\r\nis voting in machine form, and perhaps by “machine” plan! How smoothly\r\nwas the American suffrage voting in 1778 when France, Holland, Sweden,\r\nPrussia and Spain recognized America? We did not even have a capital\r\nat that time, for our enemies had ravaged Philadelphia. China has two\r\ncapitals (one of sentiment and one of fact) Nanking and Peking, but\r\nwould like to have one, if foreigners will permit her! Why should\r\nAmerica delay? “China has been forever and will be forever.” Soon she\r\nwill be strong enough not to care, but what America does _now_ she\r\nwill forever appreciate, and America will sit nearest to her heart’s\r\ngratitude. Think of it! A republic of 400,000,000 people trading\r\nand communing with us across the narrowing Pacific, and beneath the\r\nsmiling rays of the same warm sun which we both face: an altruistic\r\nbrotherhood of East and West, working for the uplift of the whole\r\nworld. China should be recognized and sent on her way rejoicing. Be\r\nnot deceived; the new Chinese know us well, and take due remembrance\r\nof any delay that is based on narrow-mindedness or the uncharitable or\r\nselfish heart. Great cycles have opened beyond the seas; let America\r\nand Britain be great with them, and part of that greatness consists in\r\nhelping China to be great. One leading Chinese minister and polished\r\norator in our own language, who, I believe, will some day be president\r\nof China, for he has the youth, ability and ambition, told me with\r\ntears in his enthusiastic eyes, as he declaimed on the great subject,\r\nthat if America will stand by China in this matter of honor, China\r\nwill engrave gratitude forever on the core of her heart. The Chinese\r\nrepublican officials say that whether the excuse for delay is that the\r\nrepublic must be tried at the polls; or that China hasn’t railways, or\r\nChina hasn’t credit, or China hasn’t “Christian science”, and whatnot,\r\nthe delay is encouraging Russia to encroach, and is discouraging\r\ntheir own people, by the fact that one great Pacific republic won’t\r\nofficially recognize the other one, which was bought by the same awful\r\nprice set by Freedom: the sacred blood of patriots sacrificed by the\r\nwar-sword on the altar of Liberty.\r\n\r\nThe recognition movement is growing among our people, and is not\r\nconfined to one class. Many business organizations are in favor of it.\r\nThe Pacific Coast Chambers of Commerce have adopted resolutions urging\r\nfavorable action without longer delay. Our National Chamber of Commerce\r\nhas done the same thing. Senator Bacon, of Georgia, has recently\r\nintroduced in congress a joint resolution, favoring early recognition.\r\nRepresentative university presidents have written me of their sympathy\r\nwith the movement. I quote from a letter from Doctor David Starr\r\nJordan, president of Leland Stanford Jr. University, of California, as\r\nfollows: “I am thoroughly in sympathy with your work for recognition,\r\nand am thoroughly in sympathy with the desire of most of the American\r\npeople that the republic in China may be officially recognized by the\r\nUnited States.” Notable pulpit orators have also joined the movement. I\r\nquote from a representative letter from the Reverend Doctor John Haynes\r\nHolmes, pastor of the Unitarian church of the Messiah, Park Avenue, New\r\nYork City, as follows: “The Chinese subjects which you have suggested\r\nthat my church, along with others, should bring to the attention of\r\nour people, are certainly pertinent. I am particularly interested in\r\nthe second, viz., recognition of China as a sister republic. I shall\r\nhope to find place in my preaching for some emphatic favorable mention\r\nof these matters. With appreciation of the splendid work that you are\r\ndoing for China’s recognition, I am.”\r\n\r\nIt is fitting that I should close this volume with the following\r\nimportant letter to me from my one-time fellow-townsman of Hongkong,\r\nDoctor Sun Yat Sen (Sunyacius), the leading citizen of the New China,\r\nthe greatest of the Chinese reformers, who was at the head of the\r\nChinese republican revolution; the first provisional president of\r\nChina at Nanking, and who is at present the head of China’s National\r\nRailway and Industrial Development Board. This message, which will\r\nmake history, is really a semi-official message from the vast Chinese\r\nrepublic of 400,000,000 people, through their greatest hero, the\r\nChristian founder of their republic, and their most influential\r\nofficial and citizen, to the American people. It reads:\r\n\r\n“I have the honor of acknowledging your letters, together with the\r\nnewspaper interviews with you urging America’s prompt recognition of\r\nthe Chinese republic. In reply I beg to inform you that your effort in\r\nyour interviews, books, etc., in conducting this campaign in China’s\r\ninterest, is highly appreciated by me and my associates. We hope that\r\nyour efforts for the recognition of China by the United States of\r\nAmerica will be _speedily crowned with great success_.”\r\n\r\nThose who know the American people know that their hearts unanimously\r\nbespeak a warm and favorable answer without further delay to so\r\nmomentous an appeal.

published by The Bobbs-Merrill Company,\r\nIndianapolis and New York; seventy-one splendid illustrations, three\r\ncolored maps, $2.50; and by T. Warner Laurie, Fleet Street, London,\r\n12s. 6d.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESS COMMENTS\r\n\r\nCook’s _Tours Annual_, 1911–12, page 108, recommends this book to world\r\ntourists.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia _Item_: “It is not only the most authoritative, valuable\r\nand up-to-date book on China; it is also the most readable.”\r\n\r\nParis _La Nouvelle Revue_: “You will not find its equal as first-hand\r\ninformation. Treated with marvelous mastership ... a keen observer ...\r\nfull of puissant interest.”\r\n\r\nNew York _Herald_: “A very complete view, graphically dealt with.”\r\n\r\nNew York _American_: “The definitive book on China.”\r\n\r\nNew York _Evening Post_ and New York _Nation_: “Relates in a humorous\r\nvein his rich observations. It is refreshing to find so much valuable\r\nand fresh information expressed in a quaint and original manner.\r\nA comprehensive grasp of the greatest problem of the Far East....\r\nProphetic words.... One of the most interesting and instructive books\r\non the Chinese; ... most charming.”\r\n\r\nNew York _Tribune_: “A fund of descriptive information.”\r\n\r\nNew York _Times_: “The British reviewers speak as enthusiastically\r\nof this book as the American journals have done. Written in a\r\npleasant and easy manner.... He is the happy possessor of a highly\r\ndeveloped efficiency and sense of humor.... Should prove agreeable to\r\na great circle of readers.... Excellent descriptive powers and gift\r\nof observation.... Of inestimable use to the student, merchant or\r\ntraveler.”\r\n\r\nNew York _Sun_: “Fresh and seeing eyes; a flowing pen; that human\r\nsympathy which counts greatly in gaining sympathetic readers; an\r\nastonishing quantity of facts presented with so light a hand as\r\nto invite the reader on almost every page; ... brilliantly clear\r\nphotographs; Mr. Thomson’s text itself is almost pictorial.”\r\n\r\nChicago _Journal_: “The only readable book ever written about that\r\nweirdly interesting people.”\r\n\r\nColumbus _Journal_: “A book that is believed to be the best English\r\ndefinition yet given of the Chinese and their country.”\r\n\r\nPortland, Oregon, _Chamber of Commerce Bulletin_: “This volume is in\r\nthe forefront of them all.”\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia _Press_: “For the American there is no book on China equal\r\nto this one.”\r\n\r\nPittsburgh _Dispatch_: “Our leading authority on Far Eastern questions;\r\nhe enunciates the American doctrine of the Far East.”\r\n\r\nLondon _News_: “Few writers have dealt satisfactorily with the subject,\r\nand there was plenty of room for such a book as _The Chinese_.... He\r\nhas given a valuable and instructive picture of China as she stands\r\nto-day at her time of crisis.”\r\n\r\nLondon _Times_: “Knows China intimately; keen eye for detail; terse and\r\ngraphic style; ... mass of information.”\r\n\r\nHongkong, China, _Mail_: “Keenly observant; shrewd and sympathetic\r\ninsight; ... a vision of China of the present day, very telling in its\r\nbrightness and jauntiness of comparison; splendidly phrased.”\r\n\r\nNew York _Commercial_: “Most acute and pertinent observer. Fascinating\r\nqualities of style not unworthy of the brilliant pen of Macaulay. The\r\nbook has a deep and permanent delight.”\r\n\r\nChicago _Banker_: “A new authoritative treatise by a writer resident in\r\nChina for years.”\r\n\r\nEdinburgh _Scotsman_: “It may be doubted if there has been a volume\r\npublished for a long time which gives a better idea of the present\r\ncondition of the country.... He gives a vivid impression and is endowed\r\nwith a gift of humor.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected.\r\n\r\nPunctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant\r\npreference was found; otherwise, they were not changed.\r\n\r\nAmbiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.\r\n\r\nIndex not checked for proper alphabetization or correct page references.\r\n\r\nPage 121: “heard Madame Manchu Innocence thrill” was printed that way.\r\n\r\nPage 181: “Nasymth Wilson Company” is a misprint for “Nasmyth Wilson\r\nCompany”.\r\n\r\nPage 215: “not calculated to give China fair play” was printed as “not\r\ncalculated in give China fair play”; changed here.\r\n\r\nPage 220: “oligarchal Russian army” was printed that way.\r\n\r\nPage 279: “Incoporator Dill” was printed that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's China Revolutionized, by John Stuart Thomson",
