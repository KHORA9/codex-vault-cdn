The only vestiges of that form, in\r\nits present shape, are certain modes of expression. The language\r\nretains the character of an address by a speaker to his hearers; being\r\nmore familiar, direct, and personal than is ordinarily employed in the\r\nrelations of an author to a reader.\r\n\r\nThe former work was prepared under circumstances which prevented a\r\nthorough investigation of the subject. Leisure and freedom from\r\nprofessional duties have now enabled me to prosecute the researches\r\nnecessary to do justice to it.\r\n\r\nThe \"Lectures on Witchcraft,\" published in 1831, have long been out of\r\nprint. Although frequently importuned to prepare a new edition, I was\r\nunwilling to issue again what I had discovered to be an insufficient\r\npresentation of the subject. In the mean time,[i.viii] it constantly\r\nbecame more and more apparent, that much injury was resulting from the\r\nwant of a complete and correct view of a transaction so often referred\r\nto, and universally misunderstood.\r\n\r\nThe first volume of this work contains what seems to me necessary to\r\nprepare the reader for the second, in which the incidents and\r\ncircumstances connected with the witchcraft prosecutions in 1692, at\r\nthe village and in the town of Salem, are reduced to chronological\r\norder, and exhibited in detail.\r\n\r\nAs showing how far the beliefs of the understanding, the perceptions of\r\nthe senses, and the delusions of the imagination, may be confounded,\r\nthe subject belongs not only to theology and moral and political\r\nscience, but to physiology, in its original and proper use, as\r\nembracing our whole nature; and the facts presented may help to\r\nconclusions relating to what is justly regarded as the great mystery of\r\nour being,—the connection between the body and the mind.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to mention the various well-known works of authority\r\nand illustration, as they are referred to in the text. But I cannot\r\nrefrain from bearing my grateful testimony to the value of the\r\n\"Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society\" and the\r\n\"New-England Historical and Genealogical Register.\" The \"Historical\r\nCollections\" and the \"Proceedings\" of the Essex Institute have afforded\r\nme inestimable assistance. Such works as these are providing the\r\nmaterials[i.ix] that will secure to our country a history such as no\r\nother nation can have. Our first age will not be shrouded in darkness\r\nand consigned to fable, but, in all its details, brought within the\r\nrealm of knowledge. Every person who desires to preserve the memory of\r\nhis ancestors, and appreciate the elements of our institutions and\r\ncivilization, ought to place these works, and others like them, on the\r\nshelves of his library, in an unbroken and continuing series. A debt of\r\ngratitude is due to the earnest, laborious, and disinterested students\r\nwho are contributing the results of their explorations to the treasures\r\nof antiquarian and genealogical learning which accumulate in these\r\npublications.\r\n\r\nA source of investigation, especially indispensable in the preparation\r\nof the present work, deserves to be particularly noticed. In 1647, the\r\nGeneral Court of Massachusetts provided by law for the taking of\r\ntestimony, in all cases, under certain regulations, in the form of\r\ndepositions, to be preserved _in perpetuam rei memoriam_. The evidence\r\nof witnesses was prepared in writing, beforehand, to be used at the\r\ntrials; they to be present at the time, to meet further inquiry, if\r\nliving within ten miles, and not unavoidably prevented. In a capital\r\ncase, the presence of the witness, as well as his written testimony,\r\nwas absolutely required. These depositions were lodged in the files,\r\nand constitute the most valuable materials of history. In our[i.x] day,\r\nthe statements of witnesses ordinarily live only in the memory of\r\npersons present at the trials, and are soon lost in oblivion. In cases\r\nattracting unusual interest, stenographers are employed to furnish them\r\nto the press. There were no newspaper reporters or \"court calendars\" in\r\nthe early colonial times; but these depositions more than supply their\r\nplace. Given in, as they were, in all sorts of cases,—of wills,\r\ncontracts, boundaries and encroachments, assault and battery, slander,\r\nlarceny, &c., they let us into the interior, the very inmost recesses,\r\nof life and society in all their forms. The extent to which, by the aid\r\nof William P. Upham, Esq., of Salem, I have drawn from this source is\r\napparent at every page.\r\n\r\nA word is necessary to be said relating to the originals of the\r\ndocuments that belong to the witchcraft proceedings. They were probably\r\nall deposited at the time in the clerk's office of Essex County. A\r\nconsiderable number of them were, from some cause, transferred to the\r\nState archives, and have been carefully preserved. Of the residue, a\r\nvery large proportion have been abstracted from time to time by\r\nunauthorized hands, and many, it is feared, destroyed or otherwise\r\nlost. Two very valuable parcels have found their way into the libraries\r\nof the Massachusetts Historical Society and the Essex Institute, where\r\nthey are faithfully secured. A few others have come to light among\r\npapers in the possession of individuals. It is to be[i.xi] hoped, that,\r\nif any more should be found, they will be lodged in some public\r\ninstitution; so that, if thought best, they may all be collected,\r\narranged, and placed beyond wear, tear, and loss, in the perpetual\r\ncustody of type.\r\n\r\nThe papers remaining in the office of the clerk of this county were\r\ntranscribed into a volume a few years since; the copyist supplying,\r\nconjecturally, headings to the several documents. Although he executed\r\nhis work in an elegant manner, and succeeded in giving correctly many\r\ndocuments hard to be deciphered, such errors, owing to the condition of\r\nthe papers, occurred in arranging them, transcribing their contents,\r\nand framing their headings, that I have had to resort to the originals\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\nAs the object of this work is to give to the reader of the present day\r\nan intelligible view of a transaction of the past, and not to\r\nillustrate any thing else than the said transaction, no attempt has\r\nbeen made to preserve the orthography of that period. Most of the\r\noriginal papers were written without any expectation that they would\r\never be submitted to inspection in print; many of them by plain country\r\npeople, without skill in the structure of sentences, or regard to\r\nspelling; which, in truth, was then quite unsettled. It is no uncommon\r\nthing to find the same word spelled differently in the same document.\r\nIt is very questionable whether it is expedient or just to\r\nperpetuate[i.xii] blemishes, often the result of haste or carelessness,\r\narising from mere inadvertence. In some instances, where the interest\r\nof the passage seemed to require it, the antique style is preserved. In\r\nno case is a word changed or the structure altered; but the now\r\nreceived spelling is generally adopted, and the punctuation made to\r\nexpress the original sense.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed necessary, in what claims to be an exact reprint of an old\r\nwork, to imitate its orthography precisely, even at the expense of\r\ndifficulty in apprehending at once the meaning, and of perpetuating\r\nerrors of carelessness and ignorance. Such modern reproductions are\r\nvaluable, and have an interest of their own. They deserve the favor of\r\nall who desire to examine critically, and in the most authentic form,\r\npublications of which the original copies are rare, and the earliest\r\neditions exhausted. The enlightened and enterprising publishers who are\r\nthus providing facsimiles of old books and important documents of past\r\nages ought to be encouraged and rewarded by a generous public. But the\r\npresent work does not belong to that class, or make any pretensions of\r\nthat kind.\r\n\r\nMy thanks are especially due to the Hon. Asahel Huntington, clerk of\r\nthe courts in Essex County, for his kindness in facilitating the use of\r\nthe materials in his office; to the Hon. Oliver Warner, secretary of\r\nthe Commonwealth, and the officers of his department; and to Stephen N.\r\nGifford, Esq., clerk of the Senate.[i.xiii]\r\n\r\nDavid Pulsifer, Esq., in the office of the Secretary of State, is well\r\nknown for his pre-eminent skill and experience in mastering the\r\nchirography of the primitive colonial times, and elucidating its\r\npeculiarities. He has been unwearied in his labors, and most earnest in\r\nhis efforts, to serve me.\r\n\r\nMr. Samuel G. Drake, who has so largely illustrated our history and\r\nexplored its sources, has, by spontaneous and considerate acts of\r\ncourtesy rendered me important help. Similar expressions of friendly\r\ninterest by Mr. William B. Towne, of Brookline, Mass.; Hon. J. Hammond\r\nTrumbull, of Hartford, Conn.; and George H. Moore, Esq., of New-York\r\nCity,—are gratefully acknowledged.\r\n\r\nSamuel P. Fowler, Esq., of Danvers, generously placed at my disposal\r\nhis valuable stores of knowledge relating to the subject. The officers\r\nin charge of the original papers, in the Historical Society and the\r\nEssex Institute, have allowed me to examine and use them.\r\n\r\nI cordially express my acknowledgments to the Hon. Benjamin F. Browne,\r\nof Salem, who, retired from public life and the cares of business, is\r\ngiving the leisure of his venerable years to the collection,\r\npreservation, and liberal contribution of an unequalled amount of\r\nknowledge respecting our local antiquities.\r\n\r\nCharles W. Palfray, Esq., while attending the General Court as a\r\nRepresentative of Salem, in 1866,[i.xiv] gave me the great benefit of\r\nhis explorations among the records and papers in the State House.\r\n\r\nMr. Moses Prince, of Danvers Centre, is an embodiment of the history,\r\ngenealogy, and traditions of that locality, and has taken an active and\r\nzealous interest in the preparation of this work. Andrew Nichols, Esq.,\r\nof Danvers, and the family of the late Colonel Perley Putnam, of Salem,\r\nalso rendered me much aid.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Charles Davis, Esq., of Beverly, for the use of the\r\nrecord-book of the church, composed of \"the brethren and sisters\r\nbelonging to Bass River,\" gathered Sept. 20, 1667, now the First Church\r\nof Beverly; and to James Hill, Esq., town-clerk of that place, for\r\naccess to the records in his charge.\r\n\r\nTo Gilbert Tapley, Esq., chairman of the committee of the parish, and\r\nAugustus Mudge, Esq., its clerk, and to the Rev. Mr. Rice, pastor of\r\nthe church, at Danvers Centre, I cannot adequately express my\r\nobligations. Without the free use of the original parish and church\r\nrecord-books with which they intrusted me, and having them constantly\r\nat hand, I could not have begun adequately to tell the story of Salem\r\nVillage or the Witchcraft Delusion.\r\n\r\nC.W.U.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[i.xv]\r\nMAP AND ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe map, based upon various local maps and the Coast-Survey chart, is\r\nthe result of much personal exploration and perambulation of the\r\nground. It may claim to be a very exact representation of many of the\r\noriginal grants and farms. The locality of the houses, mills, and\r\nbridges, in 1692, is given in some cases precisely, and in all with\r\nnear approximation. The task has been a difficult one. An original plot\r\nof Governor Endicott's Ipswich River grant, No. III., is in the State\r\nHouse, and one of the Swinnerton grant, No. XIX., in the Salem\r\ntown-books. Neither of them, however, affords elements by which to\r\nestablish its exact location. A plot of the Townsend Bishop grant, No.\r\nXX., as its boundaries were finally determined, is in the State House,\r\nand another of the same in the court-files of the county. This gives\r\none fixed and known point, Hadlock's Bridge, from which, following the\r\nlines by points of compass and distances, as indicated on the plot and\r\ndescribed in the Colonial Records, all the sides of the grant are laid\r\nout with accuracy, and its place on the map determined with absolute\r\ncertainty. A very perfect and scientifically executed plan of a part of\r\nthe boundary between Salem and Reading in[i.xvi] 1666 is in the State\r\nHouse; of which an exact tracing was kindly furnished by Mr. H.J.\r\nCoolidge, of the Secretary of State's office. It gives two of the sides\r\nof the Governor Bellingham grant, No. IV., in such a manner as to\r\nafford the means of projecting it with entire certainty, and fixing its\r\nlocality. There are no other plots of original or early grants or farms\r\non this territory; but, starting from the Bishop and Bellingham grants\r\nthus laid out in their respective places, by a collation of deeds of\r\nconveyance and partition on record, with the aid of portions of the\r\nprimitive stone-walls still remaining, and measurements resting on\r\npermanent objects, the entire region has been reduced to a demarkation\r\ncomprehending the whole area. The locations of then-existing roads have\r\nbeen obtained from the returns of laying-out committees, and other\r\nevidence in the records and files. The construction of the map, in all\r\nits details, is the result of the researches and labors of W.P. Upham.\r\n\r\nThe death-warrant is a photograph by E.R. Perkins, of Salem. The\r\noriginal, among the papers on file in the office of the clerk of the\r\ncourts of Essex County, having always been regarded as a great\r\ncuriosity, has been subjected to constant handling, and become much\r\nobscured by dilapidation. The letters, and in some instances entire\r\nwords, at the end of the lines, are worn off. To preserve it, if\r\npossible, from further injury, it has been pasted on cloth. Owing to\r\nthis circumstance, and the yellowish hue to which the paper has faded,\r\nit does not take favorably by photograph; but the exactness of\r\nimitation, which can only thus be obtained with absolute certainty, is\r\nmore important than any other consideration. Only so much as contains\r\nthe body of the warrant, the sheriff's return, and the seal, are\r\ngiven.[i.xvii] The tattered margins are avoided, as they reveal the\r\ncloth, and impair the antique aspect of the document. The original is\r\nslowly disintegrating and wasting away, notwithstanding the efforts to\r\npreserve it; and its appearance, as seen to-day, can only be\r\nperpetuated in photograph. The warrant is reduced about one-third, and\r\nthe return one-half.\r\n\r\nThe Townsend Bishop house and the outlines of Witch Hill are from\r\nsketches by O.W.H. Upham. The English house is from a drawing made on\r\nthe spot by J.R. Penniman of Boston, in 1822, a few years before its\r\ndemolition, for the use of which I am indebted to James Kimball, Esq.,\r\nof Salem. The view of Salem Village and of the Jacobs' house are\r\nreduced, by O.W.H. Upham, from photographs by E.R. Perkins.\r\n\r\nThe map and other engravings, including the autographs, were all\r\ndelineated by O.W.H. Upham.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note: The map was missing from the volume used to\r\nprepare this e-text.

This, like all the\r\n other propensities of our nature, is accompanied by faculties to\r\n secure its gratification. The gift of speech, by which the parent can\r\n convey information to the child—the old transmit intelligence to the\r\n young—is an indication that it is the design of the Author of our\r\n being that we should receive from those passing away the narrative of\r\n their experience, and communicate the results of our own to the\r\n generations that succeed us. All nations have, to a greater or less\r\n degree, been faithful to their trust in using the gift to fulfil the\r\n design of the Giver. It is impossible to name a people who do not\r\n possess cherished traditions that have descended from their early\r\n ancestors.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is generally considered that the invention of a system of\r\narbitrary and external signs to communicate thought is one of the\r\ngreatest and most[i.2] arduous achievements of human ingenuity, yet so\r\nuniversal is the disposition to make future generations acquainted with\r\nour condition and history,—a disposition the efficient cause of which\r\ncan only be found in a sense of the value of such knowledge,—that you\r\ncan scarcely find a people on the face of the globe, who have not\r\ncontrived, by some means or other, from the rude monument of shapeless\r\nrock to the most perfect alphabetical language, to communicate with\r\nposterity; thus declaring, as with the voice of Nature herself, that it\r\nis desirable and proper that all men should know as much as possible of\r\nthe character, actions, and fortunes of their predecessors on the stage\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to discern the end for which this disposition to\r\npreserve for the future and contemplate the past was imparted to us. If\r\nall that we knew were what is taught by our individual experience, our\r\nminds would have but little, comparatively, to exercise and expand\r\nthem, and our characters would be the result of the limited influences\r\nembraced within the narrow sphere of our particular and immediate\r\nrelations and circumstances. But, as our notice is extended in the\r\nobservation of those who have lived before us, our materials for\r\nreflection and sources of instruction are multiplied. The virtues we\r\nadmire in our ancestors not only adorn and dignify their names, but win\r\nus to their imitation. Their prosperity and happiness spread abroad a\r\ndiffusive light that reaches us, and brightens our condition. The\r\nwisdom that[i.3] guided their footsteps becomes, at the same time, a\r\nlamp to our path. The observation of the errors of their course, and of\r\nthe consequent disappointments and sufferings that befell them, enables\r\nus to pass in safety through rocks and ledges on which they were\r\nshipwrecked; and, while we grieve to see them eating the bitter fruits\r\nof their own ignorance and folly as well as vices and crimes, we can\r\nseize the benefit of their experience without paying the price at which\r\nthey purchased it.\r\n\r\nIn the desire which every man feels to learn the history, and be\r\ninstructed by the example, of his predecessors, and in the accompanying\r\ndisposition, with the means of carrying it into effect, to transmit a\r\nknowledge of himself and his own times to his successors, we discover\r\nthe wise and admirable arrangement of a providence which removes the\r\nworn-out individual to a better country, but leaves the acquisitions of\r\nhis mind and the benefit of his experience as an accumulating and\r\ncommon fund for the use of his posterity; which has secured the\r\ncontinued renovation of the race, without the loss of the wisdom of\r\neach generation.\r\n\r\nThese considerations suggest the true definition of history. It is the\r\ninstrument by which the results of the great experiment of human action\r\non this theatre of being are collected and transmitted from age to age.\r\nSpeaking through the records of history, the generations that have gone\r\nwarn and guide the generations that follow. History is the Past,\r\nteaching Philosophy to the Present, for the Future.[i.4]\r\n\r\nSince this is the true and proper design of history, it assumes an\r\nexalted station among the branches of human knowledge. Every community\r\nthat aspires to become intelligent and virtuous should cherish it.\r\nInstitutions for the promotion and diffusion of useful information\r\nshould have special reference to it. And all people should be induced\r\nto look back to the days of their forefathers, to be warned by their\r\nerrors, instructed by their wisdom, and stimulated in the career of\r\nimprovement by the example of their virtues.\r\n\r\nThe historian would find a great amount and variety of materials in the\r\nannals of this old town,—greater, perhaps, than in any other of its\r\ngrade in the country. But there is one chapter in our history of\r\npre-eminent interest and importance. The witchcraft delusion of 1692\r\nhas attracted universal attention since the date of its occurrence, and\r\nwill, in all coming ages, render the name of Salem notable throughout\r\nthe world. Wherever the place we live in is mentioned, this memorable\r\ntransaction will be found associated with it; and those who know\r\nnothing else of our history or our character will be sure to know, and\r\ntauntingly to inform us that they know, that we hanged the witches.\r\n\r\nIt is surely incumbent upon us to possess ourselves of correct and just\r\nviews of a transaction thus indissolubly connected with the reputation\r\nof our home, with the memory of our fathers, and, of course, with the\r\nmost precious part of the inheritance of our chil[i.5]dren. I am\r\napprehensive that the community is very superficially acquainted with\r\nthis transaction. All have heard of the Salem witchcraft; hardly any\r\nare aware of the real character of that event. Its mention creates a\r\nsmile of astonishment, and perhaps a sneer of contempt, or, it may be,\r\na thrill of horror for the innocent who suffered; but there is reason\r\nto fear, that it fails to suggest those reflections, and impart that\r\nsalutary instruction, without which the design of Providence in\r\npermitting it to take place cannot be accomplished. There are, indeed,\r\nfew passages in the history of any people to be compared with it in all\r\nthat constitutes the pitiable and tragical, the mysterious and awful.\r\nThe student of human nature will contemplate in its scenes one of the\r\nmost remarkable developments which that nature ever assumed; while the\r\nmoralist, the statesman, and the Christian philosopher will severally\r\nfind that it opens widely before them a field fruitful in instruction.\r\n\r\nOur ancestors have been visited with unmeasured reproach for their\r\nconduct on the occasion. Sad, indeed, was the delusion that came over\r\nthem, and shocking the extent to which their bewildered imaginations\r\nand excited passions hurried and drove them on. Still, however, many\r\nconsiderations deserve to be well weighed before sentence is passed\r\nupon them. And while I hope to give evidence of a readiness to have\r\nevery thing appear in its own just light, and to expose to view the\r\nvery darkest features of the transaction, I am confident of being able\r\nto bring forward[i.6] such facts and reflections as will satisfy you\r\nthat no reproach ought to be attached to them, in consequence of this\r\naffair, which does not belong, at least equally, to all other nations,\r\nand to the greatest and best men of their times and of previous ages;\r\nand, in short, that the final predominating sentiment their conduct\r\nshould awaken is not so much that of anger and indignation as of pity\r\nand compassion.\r\n\r\nLet us endeavor to carry ourselves back to the state of the colony of\r\nMassachusetts one hundred and seventy years ago. The persecutions our\r\nancestors had undergone in their own country, and the privations,\r\naltogether inconceivable by us, they suffered during the early years of\r\ntheir residence here, acting upon their minds and characters, in\r\nco-operation with the influences of the political and ecclesiastical\r\noccurrences that marked the seventeenth century, had imparted a gloomy,\r\nsolemn, and romantic turn to their dispositions and associations, which\r\nwas transmitted without diminution to their children, strengthened and\r\naggravated by their peculiar circumstances. It was the triumphant age\r\nof superstition. The imagination had been expanded by credulity, until\r\nit had reached a wild and monstrous growth. The Puritans were always\r\nprone to subject themselves to its influence; and New England, at the\r\ntime to which we are referring, was a most fit and congenial theatre\r\nupon which to display its power. Cultivation had made but a slight\r\nencroachment on the wilderness. Wide, dark, unexplored forests covered\r\nthe[i.7] hills, hung over the lonely roads, and frowned upon the\r\nscattered settlements. Persons whose lives have been passed where the\r\nsurface has long been opened, and the land generally cleared, little\r\nknow the power of a primitive wilderness upon the mind. There is\r\nnothing more impressive than its sombre shadows and gloomy recesses.\r\nThe solitary wanderer is ever and anon startled by the strange,\r\nmysterious sounds that issue from its hidden depths. The distant fall\r\nof an ancient and decayed trunk, or the tread of animals as they prowl\r\nover the mouldering branches with which the ground is strown; the\r\nfluttering of unseen birds brushing through the foliage, or the moaning\r\nof the wind sweeping over the topmost boughs,—these all tend to excite\r\nthe imagination and solemnize the mind. But the stillness of a forest\r\nis more startling and awe-inspiring than its sounds. Its silence is so\r\ndeep as itself to become audible to the inner soul. It is not\r\nsurprising that wooded countries have been the fruitful fountains and\r\nnurseries of superstition.\r\n\r\n\"In such a place as this, at such an hour,\r\nIf ancestry can be in aught believed,\r\nDescending spirits have conversed with man,\r\nAnd told the secrets of the world unknown.\"\r\n\r\nThe forests which surrounded our ancestors were the abode of a\r\nmysterious race of men of strange demeanor and unascertained origin.\r\nThe aspects they presented, the stories told of them, and every thing\r\nconnected with them, served to awaken fear, bewilder the imagination,\r\nand aggravate the tendencies of the general condition of things to\r\nfanatical enthusiasm.[i.8]\r\n\r\nIt was the common belief, sanctioned, as will appear in the course of\r\nthis discussion, not by the clergy alone, but by the most learned\r\nscholars of that and the preceding ages, that the American Indians were\r\nthe subjects and worshippers of the Devil, and their powwows, wizards.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this opinion, the entire want of confidence and\r\nsympathy to which it gave rise, and the provocations naturally incident\r\nto two races of men, of dissimilar habits, feelings, and ideas, thrown\r\ninto close proximity, a state of things was soon brought about which\r\nled to conflicts and wars of the most distressing and shocking\r\ncharacter. A strongly rooted sentiment of hostility and horror became\r\nassociated in the minds of the colonists with the name of Indian. There\r\nwas scarcely a village where the marks of savage violence and cruelty\r\ncould not be pointed out, or an individual whose family history did not\r\ncontain some illustration of the stealth, the malice or the vengeance\r\nof the savage foe. In 1689, John Bishop, and Nicholas Reed a servant of\r\nEdward Putnam; and, in 1690, Godfrey Sheldon, were killed by Indians in\r\nSalem. In the year 1691, about six months previous to the commencement\r\nof the witchcraft delusion, the county of Essex was ordered to keep\r\ntwenty-four scouts constantly in the field, to guard the frontiers\r\nagainst the savage enemy, and to give notice of his approach, then\r\nlooked for every hour with the greatest alarm and apprehension.\r\n\r\nEvents soon justified the dread of Indian hostilities[i.9] felt by the\r\npeople of this neighborhood. Within six years after the witchcraft\r\ndelusion, incursions of the savage foe took place at various points,\r\ncarrying terror to all hearts. In August, 1696, they killed or took\r\nprisoners fifteen persons at Billerica, burning many houses. In October\r\nof the same year, they came upon Newbury, and carried off and\r\ntomahawked nine persons; all of whom perished, except a lad who\r\nsurvived his wounds. In 1698, they made a murderous and destructive\r\nassault upon Haverhill. The story of the capture, sufferings, and\r\nheroic achievements of Hannah Dustin, belongs to the history of this\r\nevent. It stands by the side of the immortal deed of Judith, and has no\r\nother parallel in all the annals of female daring and prowess. On the\r\n3d of July, 1706, a garrison was stormed at night in Dunstable; and\r\nHolyoke, a son of Edward Putnam, with three other soldiers, was killed.\r\nHe was twenty-two years of age. In 1708, seven hundred Algonquin and\r\nSt. Francis Indians, under the command of French officers, fell again\r\nupon Haverhill about break of day, on the 29th of August; consigned the\r\ntown to conflagration and plunder; destroyed a large amount of\r\nproperty; massacred the minister Mr. Rolfe, the commander of the post\r\nCaptain Wainwright, together with nearly forty others; and carried off\r\nmany into captivity. On this occasion, a troop of horse and a foot\r\ncompany from Salem Village rushed to the rescue; the then minister of\r\nthe parish, the Rev. Joseph Green, seized his gun and went with them.\r\nThey pursued the flying Indians for[i.10] some distance. So deeply were\r\nthe people of Haverhill impressed by the valor and conduct of Mr. Green\r\nand his people, that they sent a letter of thanks, and desired him to\r\ncome and preach to them. He complied with the invitation, spent a\r\nSunday there, and thus gave them an opportunity to express personally\r\ntheir gratitude. On other occasions, he accompanied his people on\r\nsimilar expeditions.\r\n\r\nThese occurrences show that the fears and anxieties of the colonists in\r\nreference to Indian assaults were not without grounds at the period of\r\nthe witchcraft delusion. They were, at that very time, hanging like a\r\nstorm-cloud over their heads, soon to burst, and spread death and\r\ndestruction among them.\r\n\r\nThere was but little communication between the several villages and\r\nsettlements. To travel from Boston to Salem, for instance, which the\r\nordinary means of conveyance enable us to do at present in less than an\r\nhour, was then the fatiguing, adventurous, and doubtful work of an\r\nentire day.\r\n\r\nIt was the darkest and most desponding period in the civil history of\r\nNew England. The people, whose ruling passion then was, as it has ever\r\nsince been, a love for constitutional rights, had, a few years before,\r\nbeen thrown into dismay by the loss of their charter, and, from that\r\ntime, kept in a feverish state of anxiety respecting their future\r\npolitical destinies. In addition to all this, the whole sea-coast was\r\nexposed to danger: ruthless pirates were continually prowling along the\r\nshores. Commerce was nearly[i.11] extinguished, and great losses had\r\nbeen experienced by men in business. A recent expedition against Canada\r\nhad exposed the colonies to the vengeance of France.\r\n\r\nThe province was encumbered with oppressive taxes, and weighed down by\r\na heavy debt. The sum assessed upon Salem to defray the expenses of the\r\ncountry at large, the year before the witchcraft prosecutions, was\r\n£1,346. 1_s._ Besides this, there were the town taxes. The whole\r\namounted, no doubt, inclusive of the support of the ministry, to a\r\nweight of taxation, considering the greater value of money at that\r\ntime, of which we have no experience, and can hardly form an adequate\r\nconception. The burden pressed directly upon the whole community. There\r\nwere then no great private fortunes, no moneyed institutions, no\r\nconsiderable foreign commerce, few, if any, articles of luxury, and no\r\nlarge business-capitals to intercept and divert its pressure. It was\r\nborne to its whole extent by the unaided industry of a population of\r\nextremely moderate estates and very limited earnings, and almost\r\ncrushed it to the earth.\r\n\r\nThe people were dissatisfied with the new charter. They were becoming\r\nthe victims of political jealousies, discontent, and animosities. They\r\nhad been agitated by great revolutions. They were surrounded by\r\nalarming indications of change, and their ears were constantly assailed\r\nby rumors of war. Their minds were startled and confounded by the\r\nprevalence of prophecies and forebodings of dark and dismal[i.12]\r\nevents. At this most unfortunate moment, and, as it were, to crown the\r\nwhole and fill up the measure of their affliction and terror, it was\r\ntheir universal and sober belief, that the Evil One himself was, in a\r\nspecial manner, let loose, and permitted to descend upon them with\r\nunexampled fury.\r\n\r\nThe people of Salem participated in their full share of the gloom and\r\ndespondency that pervaded the province, and, in addition to that, had\r\ntheir own peculiar troubles and distresses. Within a short time, the\r\ntown had lost almost all its venerable fathers and leading citizens,\r\nthe men whose councils had governed and whose wisdom had guided them\r\nfrom the first years of the settlement of the place. Only those who are\r\nintimately acquainted with the condition of a community of simple\r\nmanners and primitive feelings, such as were the early New-England\r\nsettlements, can have an adequate conception of the degree to which the\r\npeople were attached to their patriarchs, the extent of their\r\ndependence upon them, and the amount of the loss when they were\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this general distress and local gloom and depression,\r\nthe great and awful tragedy, whose incidents, scenes, and characters I\r\nam to present, took place.\r\n\r\n[i.13]\r\n\r\ndecoration\r\n\r\nPART FIRST.\r\n\r\ndecoration\r\n\r\n[i.14]\r\n\r\ndecoration\r\n\r\nSALEM VILLAGE.\r\n\r\ndecoration\r\n\r\n[i.15]\r\n\r\nSalem Village, 1866.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALEM VILLAGE.\r\n\r\n IT is necessary, before entering upon the subject of the witchcraft\r\n delusion, to give a particular and extended account of the immediate\r\n locality where it occurred, and of the community occupying it. This is\r\n demanded by justice to the parties concerned, and indispensable to a\r\n correct understanding of the transaction. No one, in truth, can\r\n rightly appreciate the character of the rural population of the towns\r\n first settled in Massachusetts, without tracing it to its origin, and\r\n taking into view the policy that regulated the colonization of the\r\n country at the start.\r\n\r\n\"The Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England\"\r\npossessed, by its charter from James the First, dated Nov. 3, 1620, and\r\nrenewed by Charles the First, March 4, 1629, the entire sovereignty\r\nover all the territory assigned to it. Some few conditions and\r\nexceptions were incorporated in the grant, which, in the event, proved\r\nto be merely nom[i.16]inal. The company, so far as the crown and\r\nsovereignty of England were concerned, became absolute owner of the\r\nwhole territory within its limits, and exercised its powers\r\naccordingly. It adopted wise and efficient measures to promote the\r\nsettlement of the country by emigrants of the best description. It gave\r\nto every man who transported himself at his own charge fifty acres of\r\nland, and lots, in distinction from farms, to those who should choose\r\nto settle and build in towns. In 1628, Captain John Endicott, one of\r\nthe original patentees, was sent over to superintend the management of\r\naffairs on the spot, and carry out the views of the company. On the\r\n30th of April, 1629, the company, by a full and free election, chose\r\nsaid Endicott to be \"Governor of the Plantation in the Massachusetts\r\nBay,\" to hold office for one year \"from the time he shall take the\r\noath,\" and gave him instructions for his government. In reference to\r\nthe disposal of lands, they provided that persons \"who were\r\nadventurers,\" that is, subscribers to the common stock, to the amount\r\nof fifty pounds, should have two hundred acres of land, and, at that\r\nrate, more or less, \"to the intent to build their houses, and to\r\nimprove their labors thereon.\" Adventurers who carried families with\r\nthem were to have fifty acres for each member of their respective\r\nfamilies. Other provisions were made, on the same principles, to meet\r\nthe case of servants taken over; for each of whom an additional number\r\nof acres was to be allowed. If a person should choose \"to build on\r\nthe[i.17] plot of ground where the town is intended to be built,\" he\r\nwas to have half an acre for every fifty pounds subscribed by him to\r\nthe common stock. A general discretion was given to Endicott and his\r\ncouncil to make grants to particular persons, \"according to their\r\ncharge and quality;\" having reference always to the ability of the\r\ngrantee to improve his allotment. Energetic and intelligent men, having\r\nable-bodied sons or servants, even if not adventurers, were to be\r\nfavorably regarded. Endicott carried out these instructions faithfully\r\nand judiciously during his brief administration. In the mean time, it\r\nhad been determined to transfer the charter, and the company bodily, to\r\nNew England. Upon this being settled, John Winthrop, with others,\r\njoined the company, and he was elected its governor on the 29th of\r\nOctober, 1629. On the 12th of June, 1630, he arrived in Salem, and held\r\nhis first court at Charlestown on the 28th of August.\r\n\r\nThere was some irregularity in these proceedings. The charter fixed a\r\ncertain time, \"yearly, once in the year, for ever hereafter,\" for the\r\nelection of governor, deputy-governor, and assistants. Matthew Cradock\r\nhad been elected accordingly, on the 13th of May, 1629, governor of the\r\ncompany \"for the year following.\" He presided at the General Court of\r\nthe company when Winthrop was elected governor. There does not appear\r\nto have been any formal resignation of his office by Cradock. In point\r\nof fact, the charter made no provision for a resignation of office, but\r\nonly for cases where a vacancy might be occasioned[i.18] by death, or\r\nremoval by an act of the company. It would have been more regular for\r\nthe company to have removed Cradock by a formal vote; but the great and\r\nweighty matter in which they were engaged prevented their thinking of a\r\nmere formality. Cradock had himself conceived the project they had met\r\nto carry into effect, and labored to bring it about. He vacated the\r\nchair to his successor, on the spot. Still forgetting the provisions of\r\nthe charter, they declared Winthrop elected \"for the ensuing year, to\r\nbegin on this present day,\" the 20th of October, 1629. By the language\r\nof the charter, he could only be elected to fill the vacancy \"in the\r\nroom or place\" of Cradock; that is, for the residue of the official\r\nyear established by the express provision of that instrument, namely,\r\nuntil the \"last Wednesday in Easter term\" ensuing. All usage is in\r\nfavor of this construction. The terms of the charter are explicit; and,\r\nif persons chosen to fill vacancies during the course of a year could\r\nthus be commissioned to hold an entire year from the date of their\r\nelection, the provision fixing a certain day \"yearly\" for the choice of\r\nofficers would be utterly nullified. Whether this subsequently occurred\r\nto Winthrop and his associates is not known; but, if it did, it was\r\nimpossible for them to act in conformity to the view now given; for, in\r\nthe ensuing \"last Wednesday of Easter term,\" he was at sea, in mid\r\nocean, and the several members of the company dispersed throughout his\r\nfleet. When he arrived in Salem, he found Endicott—who, in the records\r\nof the[i.19] company before its transfer to New England, is styled \"the\r\nGovernor beyond the seas\"—with his year of office not yet expired. The\r\ncompany had not chosen another in his place, and his commission still\r\nheld good. It was so evident that the vote extending the term of\r\nWinthrop's tenure to a year from the day on which he was chosen, Oct.\r\n20, 1629, was illegal, that when that year expired, in October, 1630,\r\nno motion was made to proceed to a new election. In the mean time,\r\nhowever, Endicott's year had expired; and, for aught that appears,\r\nthere was not, for several months, any legal governor or government at\r\nall in the colony. When the next \"last Wednesday of Easter term\" came\r\nround, on the 18th of May, 1631, Winthrop was chosen governor, as the\r\nrecord says, \"according to the meaning of the patent;\" and all went on\r\nsmoothly afterwards. If the difficulty into which they had got was\r\napprehended by Winthrop, Endicott, or any of their associates, they\r\nwere wise enough to see that nothing but mischief could arise from\r\ntaking notice of it; that no human ingenuity could disentangle the\r\nsnarl; and that all they could do was to wait for the lapse of time to\r\ndrift them through. The conduct of these two men on the occasion was\r\ntruly admirable. Endicott welcomed Winthrop with all the honors due to\r\nhis position as governor; opened his doors to receive him and his\r\nfamily; and manifested the affectionate respect and veneration with\r\nwhich, from his earliest manhood to his dying day, Winthrop ever\r\ninspired all men in all circumstances. Winthrop per[i.20]formed the\r\nceremony at Endicott's marriage. They each went about his own business,\r\nand said nothing of the embarrassments attached to their official\r\ntitles or powers. After a few months, Winthrop held his courts, as\r\nthough all was in good shape; and Endicott took his seat as an\r\nassistant. They proved themselves sensible, high-minded men, of true\r\npublic spirit, and friends to each other and to the country, which will\r\nfor ever honor them both as founders and fathers. They entered into no\r\ndisputes—and their descendants never should—about which was governor,\r\nor which first governor.\r\n\r\nThe disposal of lands, at the expiration of Endicott's delegated\r\nadministration, passed back into the hands of the company, and was\r\nconducted by the General Court upon the policy established at its\r\nmeetings in London. On the 3d of March, 1635, the General Court\r\nrelinquished the control and disposal of lands, within the limits of\r\ntowns, to the towns themselves. After this, all grants of lands in\r\nSalem were made by the people of the town or their own local courts.\r\nThe original land policy was faithfully adhered to here, as it probably\r\nwas in the other towns.\r\n\r\nThe following is a copy of the Act:—\r\n\r\n\"Whereas particular towns have many things which concern only\r\nthemselves, and the ordering of their own affairs, and disposing of\r\nbusinesses in their own towns, it is therefore ordered, that the\r\nfreemen of any town, or the major part of them, shall only have power\r\nto dispose of their own lands and woods, with all the privileges and\r\nappurtenances of the[i.21] said towns, to grant lots, and make such\r\norders as may concern the well ordering of their own towns, not\r\nrepugnant to the laws and orders here established by the General Court;\r\nas also to lay mulcts and penalties for the breach of these orders, and\r\nto levy and distress the same, not exceeding the sum of twenty\r\nshillings; also to choose their own particular officers, as constables,\r\nsurveyors of the high-ways, and the like; and because much business is\r\nlike to ensue to the constables of several towns, by reason they are to\r\nmake distress, and gather fines, therefore that every town shall have\r\ntwo constables, where there is need, that so their office may not be a\r\nburthen unto them, and they may attend more carefully upon the\r\ndischarge of their office, for which they shall be liable to give their\r\naccounts to this court, when they shall be called thereunto.\"\r\n\r\nThe reflecting student of political science will probably regard this\r\nas the most important legislative act in our annals. Towns had existed\r\nbefore, but were scarcely more than local designations, or convenient\r\ndivisions of the people and territories. This called them into being as\r\ndepositories and agents of political power in its mightiest efficacy\r\nand most vital force. It remitted to the people their original\r\nsovereignty. Before, that sovereignty had rested in the hands of a\r\nremote central deputation; this returned it to them in their primary\r\ncapacity, and brought it back, in its most important elements, to their\r\nimmediate control. It gave them complete possession and absolute power\r\nover their own lands, and provided the machinery for managing their own\r\nneighborhoods and making and[i.22] executing their own laws in what is,\r\nafter all, the greatest sphere of government,—that which concerns\r\nordinary, daily, immediate relations. It gave to the people the power\r\nto do and determine all that the people can do and determine, by\r\nthemselves. It created the towns as the solid foundation of the whole\r\npolitical structure of the State, trained the people as in a perpetual\r\nschool for self-government, and fitted them to be the guardians of\r\nrepublican liberty and order.\r\n\r\nLarge tracts were granted to men who had the disposition and the means\r\nfor improving them by opening roads, building bridges, clearing\r\nforests, and bringing the surface into a state for cultivation. Men of\r\nproperty, education, and high social position, were thus made to lead\r\nthe way in developing the agricultural resources of the country, and\r\ngiving character to the farming interest and class. In cases where men\r\nof energy, industry, and intelligence presented themselves, if not\r\nadventurers in the common stock, with no other property than their\r\nstrong arms and resolute wills, particularly if they had able-bodied\r\nsons, liberal grants were made. Every one who had received a town lot\r\nof half an acre was allowed to relinquish it, receiving, in exchange, a\r\ncountry lot of fifty acres or more. Under this system, a population of\r\na superior order was led out into the forest. Farms quickly spread into\r\nthe interior, seeking the meadows, occupying the arable land, and\r\nespecially following up the streams.\r\n\r\nI propose to illustrate this by a very particular enumeration of\r\ninstances, and by details that will give[i.23] us an insight of the\r\npersonal, domestic, and social elements that constituted the condition\r\nof life in the earliest age of New England, particularly in that part\r\nof the old township of Salem where the scene of our story is laid. I\r\nshall give an account of the persons and families who first settled the\r\nregion included in, and immediately contiguous to, Salem Village, and\r\nwhose children and grandchildren were actors or sufferers in, or\r\nwitnesses of, the witchcraft delusion. I am able, by the map, to show\r\nthe boundaries, to some degree of precision, of their farms, and the\r\nspots on or near which their houses stood.\r\n\r\nThe first grant of land made by the company, after it had got fairly\r\nunder way, was of six hundred acres to Governor Winthrop, on the 6th of\r\nSeptember, 1631, \"near his house at Mystic.\" The next was to the\r\ndeputy-governor, Thomas Dudley, on the 5th of June, 1632, of two\r\nhundred acres \"on the west side of Charles River, over against the new\r\ntown,\" now Cambridge. The next, on the 3d of July, 1632, was three\r\nhundred acres to John Endicott. It is described, in the record, as\r\n\"bounded on the south side with a river, commonly called the Cow House\r\nRiver, on the north side with a river, commonly called the Duck River,\r\non the east with a river, leading up to the two former rivers, known by\r\nthe name of Wooleston River, and on the west with the main land.\" The\r\nmeaning of the Indian word applied to this territory was \"Birch-wood.\"\r\nAt the period of the witchcraft delusion, and for some time afterwards,\r\n\"Cow House River\" was[i.24] called \"Endicott River.\" Subsequently it\r\nacquired the name of \"Waters River.\"\r\n\r\nThis grant constituted what was called \"the Governor's Orchard Farm.\"\r\nIn conformity with the policy on which grants were made, Endicott at\r\nonce proceeded to occupy and improve it, by clearing off the woods,\r\nerecting buildings, making roads, and building bridges. His\r\ndwelling-house embraced in its view the whole surrounding country, with\r\nthe arms of the sea. From the more elevated points of his farm, the\r\nopen sea was in sight. A road was opened by him, from the head of tide\r\nwater on Duck, now Crane, River, through the Orchard Farm, and round\r\nthe head of Cow House River, to the town of Salem, in one direction,\r\nand to Lynn and Boston in another. A few years afterwards, the town\r\ngranted him two hundred acres more, contiguous to the western line of\r\nthe Orchard Farm. After this, and as a part of the transaction, the\r\npresent Ipswich road was made, and the old road through the Orchard\r\nFarm discontinued. This illustrates the policy of the land grants. They\r\nwere made to persons who had the ability to lay out roads. The present\r\nbridge over Crane River was probably built by Endicott and the parties\r\nto whom what is now called the Plains, one of the principal villages of\r\nDanvers, had been granted. The tract granted by the town was popularly\r\ncalled the \"Governor's Plain.\" By giving, in this way, large tracts of\r\nland to men of means, the country was opened and made accessible to\r\nsettlers who had no pecuniary ability to incur large[i.25] outlays in\r\nthe way of general improvements, but had the requisite energy and\r\nindustry to commence the work of subduing the forest and making farms\r\nfor themselves. To them, smaller grants were made.\r\n\r\nThe character of the population, thus aided at the beginning in\r\nsettling the country, cannot be appreciated without giving some idea of\r\nwhat it was to open the wilderness for occupancy and cultivation. This\r\nis a subject which those who have always lived in other than frontier\r\ntowns do not perhaps understand.\r\n\r\nHow much of the land had been previously cleared by the aboriginal\r\ntribes, it may be somewhat difficult to determine. They were but\r\nslightly attached to the soil, had temporary and movable habitations,\r\nand no bulky implements or articles of furniture. They were nomadic in\r\ntheir habits. On the coast and its inlets, their light canoes gave easy\r\nmeans of transportation, for their families and all that they\r\npossessed, from point to point, and, further inland, over intervening\r\nterritory, from river to river. They probably seldom attempted, in this\r\npart of the country, to clear the rugged and stony uplands. In some\r\ninstances, they removed the trees from the soft alluvial meadows,\r\nalthough it is probable that in only a very few localities they would\r\nhave attempted such a persistent and laborious undertaking. There were\r\nlarge salt marshes, and here and there meadows, free from timber. There\r\nwere spots where fires had swept over the land and the trees\r\ndisappeared. On such spots they probably planted their corn; the land\r\nbeing made at once fertile[i.26] and easily cultivable, by the effects\r\nof the fires. Near large inland sheets of water, having no outlets\r\npassable by their canoes, and well stocked with fish, they sometimes\r\nhad permanent plantations, as at Will's Hill. With such slight\r\nexceptions, when the white settler came upon his grant, he found it\r\ncovered by the primeval wilderness, thickly set with old trees, whose\r\nroots, as well as branches, were interlocked firmly with each other,\r\nthe surface obstructed with tangled and prickly underbrush; the soil\r\nbroken, and mixed with rocks and stones,—the entire face of the country\r\nhilly, rugged, and intersected by swamps and winding streams.\r\n\r\nAmong all the achievements of human labor and perseverance recorded in\r\nhistory, there is none more herculean than the opening of a New-England\r\nforest to cultivation. The fables of antiquity are all suggestive of\r\ninstruction, and infold wisdom. The earliest inhabitants of every\r\nwooded country, who subdued its wilderness, were truly a race of\r\ngiants.\r\n\r\nLet any one try the experiment of felling and eradicating a single\r\ntree, and he will begin to approach an estimate of what the first\r\nEnglish settler had before him, as he entered upon his work. It was not\r\nonly a work of the utmost difficulty, calling for the greatest possible\r\nexercise of physical toil, strength, patience, and perseverance, but it\r\nwas a work of years and generations. The axe, swung by muscular arms,\r\ncould, one by one, fell the trees. There was no machinery to aid in\r\nextracting the tough roots, equal, often, in[i.27] size and spread, to\r\nthe branches. The practice was to level by the axe a portion of the\r\nforest, managing so as to have the trees fall inward, early in the\r\nseason. After the summer had passed, and the fallen timber become\r\ndried, fire would be set to the whole tract covered by it. After it had\r\nsmouldered out, there would be left charred trunks and stumps. The\r\ntrunks would then be drawn together, piled in heaps, and burned again.\r\nBetween the blackened stumps, barley or some other grain, and probably\r\ncorn, would be planted, and the lapse of years waited for, before the\r\nroots would be sufficiently decayed to enable oxen with chains to\r\nextract them. Then the rocks and stones would have to be removed,\r\nbefore the plough could, to any considerable extent, be applied. As\r\nlate as 1637, the people of Salem voted twenty acres, to be added\r\nwithin two years to his previous grant, to Richard Hutchinson, upon the\r\ncondition that he would, in the mean time, \"set up ploughing.\" The\r\nmeadow to the eastward of the meeting-house, seen in the head-piece of\r\nthis Part, probably was the ground where ploughing was thus first \"set\r\nup.\" The plough had undoubtedly been used before in town-lots, and by\r\nsome of the old planters who had secured favorable open locations along\r\nthe coves and shores; but it required all this length of time to bring\r\nthe interior country into a condition for its use.\r\n\r\nThe opening of a wilderness combined circumstances of interest which\r\nare not, perhaps, equalled in any other occupation. It is impossible to\r\nimagine a[i.28] more exhilarating or invigorating employment. It\r\ndeveloped the muscular powers more equally and effectively than any\r\nother. The handling of the axe brought into exercise every part of the\r\nmanly frame. It afforded room for experience and skill, as well as\r\nstrength; it was an athletic art of the highest kind, and awakened\r\nenergy, enterprise, and ambition; it was accompanied with sufficient\r\ndanger to invest it with interest, and demand the most careful judgment\r\nand observation. He who best knew how to fell a tree was justly looked\r\nupon as the most valuable and the leading man. To bring a tall giant of\r\nthe woods to the ground was a noble and perilous achievement. As it\r\nslowly trembled and tottered to its fall, it was all-important to give\r\nit the right direction, so that, as it came down with a thundering\r\ncrash, it might not be diverted from its expected course by the\r\nsurrounding trees and their multifarious branches, or its trunk slide\r\noff or rebound in an unforeseen manner, scattering fragments and\r\nthrowing limbs upon the choppers below. Accidents often, deaths\r\nsometimes, occurred. A skilful woodman, by a glance at the surrounding\r\ntrees and their branches, could tell where the tree on which he was\r\nabout to operate should fall, and bring it unerringly to the ground in\r\nthe right direction. There was, moreover, danger from lurking savages;\r\nand, if the chopper was alone in the deep woods, from the prowling\r\nsolitary bear, or hungry wolves, which, going in packs, were sometimes\r\nformidable. There were elements also, in the work, that awakened[i.29]\r\nthe finer sentiments. The lonely and solemn woods are God's first\r\ntemples. They are full of mystic influences; they nourish the poetic\r\nnature; they feed the imagination. The air is elastic, and every sound\r\nreverberates in broken, strange, and inexplicable intonations. The\r\nwoods are impregnated with a health-giving and delightful fragrance\r\nnowhere else experienced. All the arts of modern luxury fail to produce\r\nan aroma like that which pervades a primitive forest of pines and\r\nspruces. Indeed, all trees, in an original wilderness, where they exist\r\nin every stage of growth and decay, contribute to this peculiar charm\r\nof the woods. It was not only a manly, but a most lively, occupation.\r\nWhen many were working near each other, the echoes of their voices of\r\ncheer, of the sharp and ringing tones of their axes, and of the heavy\r\nconcussions of the falling timber, produced a music that filled the old\r\nforests with life, and made labor joyous and refreshing.\r\n\r\nThe length of time required to prepare a country covered by a\r\nwilderness, on a New-England soil, for cultivation, may be estimated by\r\nthe facts I have stated. A long lapse of years must intervene, after\r\nthe woods have been felled and their dried trunks and branches burned,\r\nbefore the stumps can be extracted, the land levelled, the stones\r\nremoved, the plough introduced, or the smooth green fields, which give\r\nsuch beauty to agricultural scenes, be presented. An immense amount of\r\nthe most exhausting labor must be expended in the process. The world\r\nlooks with[i.30] wonder on the dykes of Holland, the wall of China, the\r\npyramids of Egypt. I do not hesitate to say that the results produced\r\nby the small, scattered population of the American colonies, during\r\ntheir first century, in tearing up a wilderness by its roots,\r\ntransforming the rocks, with which the surface was covered, into walls,\r\nopening roads, building bridges, and making a rough and broken country\r\nsmooth and level, converting a sterile waste into fertile fields\r\nblossoming with verdure and grains and fruitage, is a more wonderful\r\nmonument of human industry and perseverance than them all. It was a\r\nwork, not of mere hired laborers, still less of servile minions, but of\r\nfreemen owning, or winning by their voluntary and cheerful toil, the\r\nacres on which they labored, and thus entitling themselves to be the\r\nsovereigns of the country they were creating. A few thousands of such\r\nmen, with such incentives, wrought wonders greater than millions of\r\nslaves or serfs ever have accomplished, or ever will.\r\n\r\nIt was not, therefore, from mere favoritism, or a blind subserviency to\r\nmen of wealth or station, that such liberal grants of land were made to\r\nWinthrop, Dudley, Endicott, and others, but for various wise and good\r\nreasons, having the welfare and happiness of the whole people,\r\nespecially the poorer classes, in view. In illustration of the one now\r\nunder consideration, a few facts may be presented. They will show the\r\namount of labor required to bring the \"Orchard Farm\" into cultivation,\r\nand which must have been procured[i.31] at a large outlay in money by\r\nthe proprietor. In the court-files are many curious papers, in the\r\nshape of depositions given by witnesses in suits of various kinds,\r\narising from time to time, showing that large numbers of hired men were\r\nkept constantly at work. Nov. 10, 1678, Edmund Grover, seventy-eight\r\nyears old, testified, \"that, above forty-five years since, I, this\r\ndeponent, wrought much upon Governor Endicott's farm, called Orchard,\r\nand did, about that time, help to cut and cleave about seven thousand\r\npalisadoes, as I remember, and was the first that made improvement\r\nthereof, by breaking up of ground and planting of Indian-corn.\" The\r\nland was granted to Endicott in July, 1632; and the work in which\r\nGrover, with others, was engaged, commenced undoubtedly forthwith.\r\nPalisadoes were young trees, of about six inches in diameter at the\r\nbutt, cut into poles of about ten feet in length, sharpened at the\r\nlarger end, and driven into the ground; those that were split or cloven\r\nwere used as rails. In this way, lots were fenced in. In some cases,\r\nthe upright posts were placed close together, as palisades in\r\nfortifications, to prevent the escape of domestic animals, and as a\r\nsafeguard against depredations upon the young cattle, sheep, and\r\npoultry, by bears, wolves, foxes, the loup-cervier, or wild-cat, with\r\nwhich the woods were infested. Grover seems to have wrought on the\r\nOrchard Farm for a short time. We find, that, a few years after the\r\npoint to which his testimony goes back, he had a farm of his own. Some\r\nwrought there for a longer time, and were permanent[i.32] retainers on\r\nthe farm. In 1635, the widow Scarlett apprenticed her son Benjamin,\r\nthen eleven years of age, to Governor Endicott. The following document,\r\nrecorded in Essex Registry of Deeds, tells his story:—\r\n\r\n\"To all christian people to whom these presents shall come, I, Benjamin\r\nScarlett of Salem, in New England, sendeth Greeting—Know ye, that I,\r\nthe said Benjamin Scarlett, having lived as a servant with Mr. John\r\nEndicott, Esq., sometimes Governor in New England, and served him near\r\nupon thirty years, for, and in consideration whereof, the said Governor\r\nEndicott gave unto me, the said Benjamin Scarlett, a certain tract of\r\nland, in the year 1650, being about 10 acres, more or less, the which\r\nland hath ever since been possessed by me, the said Benjamin Scarlett,\r\nand it lyeth at the head of Cow House River, bounded on the north with\r\nthe land of Mr. Endicott called Orchard Farm, on the South with the\r\nhigh way leading to the salt water, on the West with the road way\r\nleading to Salem, on the East with the salt water, which tract of land\r\nwas given to me, as aforesaid, during my life, and in case I should\r\nleave no issue of my body, to give it to such of his posterity as I\r\nshould see cause to bestow it upon; Know ye, therefore, that I, the\r\nsaid Benjamin Scarlett, for divers considerations me thereunto moving,\r\nhave given, granted, and by these presents do give and grant, assign,\r\nsett over, and bestow the aforesaid tract of land, with all the\r\nimprovements I have made thereon, both by building, fencing, or\r\notherwise, unto Samuel Endicott, second son to Zerubabel Endicott\r\ndeceased, and unto Hannah his wife, to have and to hold the said ten\r\nacres of land, more or less, with all the privileges and appurtenances\r\nthereunto belonging, unto the said Samuel[i.33] Endicott and Hannah his\r\nwife, to his and her own proper use and behoof forever; and after their\r\ndecease I give the said tract of land to their son Samuel Endicott. In\r\ncase he should depart this life without issue, then to be given to the\r\nnext heir of the said Samuel and Hannah.—In witness whereof I have\r\nhereunto set my hand and seal.—Dated the ninth of January one thousand\r\nsix hundred and ninety one.—Benjamin Scarlett, his mark.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, that Governor Endicott had died twenty-six years,\r\nand his son Zerubabel seven years, before the date of the foregoing\r\ndeed. No writings had passed between them in reference to the final\r\ndisposition Scarlett was conditionally to make of the estate. There\r\nwere no living witnesses of the original understanding. But the old man\r\nwas true to the sentiments of honor and gratitude. The master to whom\r\nhe had been apprenticed in his boyhood had been kind and generous to\r\nhim, and he was faithful to the letter and spirit of his engagement. He\r\nevidently made a point to have the language of the deed as strong as it\r\ncould be. He did not leave the matter to be settled by a will, but\r\ndetermined to enjoy, while living, the satisfaction of being true to\r\nhis plighted faith. He was known, in his later years, as \"old Ben\r\nScarlett.\" He did not feel ashamed to call himself a servant. But\r\nhumble and unpretending as he was, I feel a pride in rescuing his name\r\nfrom oblivion. Old Ben Scarlett will for ever hold his place among\r\nnature's nobles,—honest men.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which Endicott went in improving his[i.34] lands is shown\r\nin the particular department which gave the name to his original grant.\r\nIn 1648, he bought of Captain Trask two hundred and fifty acres of\r\nland, in another locality, giving in exchange five hundred apple-trees,\r\nof three years' growth. Such a number of fruit-trees of that age,\r\ndisposable at so early a period, could only be the result of a great\r\nexpenditure of labor and money. So many operations going on under his\r\ndirection and within his premises made his farm a school, in which\r\nlarge numbers were trained to every variety of knowledge needed by an\r\noriginal settler. The subduing of the wilderness; the breaking of the\r\nground; the building of bridges, stone-walls, \"palisadoes,\" houses, and\r\nbarns; the processes of planting; the introduction of all suitable\r\narticles of culture; the methods best adapted to the preparation of the\r\nrugged soil for production; the rearing of abundant orchards and\r\nbountiful crops; the smoothing and levelling of lands, and the\r\nlaying-out of roads,—these were all going at once, and it was quite\r\ndesirable for young men to work on his farm, before going out deeper\r\ninto the wilderness to make farms for themselves. There were many\r\nbesides Grover who availed themselves of the advantage. John Putnam was\r\na large landholder, and an original grantee; but we find his youngest\r\nson, John, attached to Endicott's establishment, and working on his\r\nfarm about the time of his maturity. In a deposition in court, in a\r\nland case of disputed boundaries, August, 1705, \"John Putnam, Sr., of\r\nfull age, testifieth and saith that—being a re[i.35]tainer in Governor\r\nEndicott's family, about fifty years since, and being intimately\r\nacquainted with the governor himself and with his son, Mr. Zerubabel\r\nEndicott, late of Salem, deceased, who succeeded in his father's right,\r\nand lived and died on the farm called Orchard Farm, in Salem—the said\r\nGovernor Endicott did oftentimes tell this deponent,\" &c. The same John\r\nPutnam, in a deposition dated 1678, says that he was then fifty years\r\nold, and that, thirty-five years before, he was at Mr. Endicott's farm,\r\nand went out to a certain place called \"Vine Cove,\" where he found Mr.\r\nEndicott; and he testifies to a conversation that he heard between Mr.\r\nEndicott and one of his men, Walter Knight. I mention these things to\r\nshow that a lad of fifteen, a son of a neighbor of large estate in\r\nlands, was an intimate visitor at the Orchard Farm; and that, when he\r\nbecame of age, before entering upon the work of clearing lands of his\r\nown, given by his father, he went as \"a retainer\" to work on the\r\ngovernor's farm. He went as a voluntary laborer, as to a school of\r\nagricultural training. This was done on other farms, first occupied by\r\nmen who had the means and the enterprise to carry on large operations.\r\nIt gave a high character, in their particular employment, to the first\r\nsettlers generally.\r\n\r\nI cannot leave this subject of Endicott on his farm, without presenting\r\nanother picture, drawn from a wilderness scene. In 1678, Nathaniel\r\nIngersol, then forty-five years of age, in a deposition sworn to in\r\ncourt, describes an incident that occurred on the east[i.36]ern end of\r\nthe Townsend Bishop farm as laid out on the map, when he was about\r\neleven years of age. His father, Richard Ingersol, had leased the farm.\r\nIt was contiguous to Endicott's land, and controversies of boundary\r\narose, which subsequently contributed to aggravate the feuds and\r\npassions that were let loose in the fury of the witchcraft proceedings.\r\nNathaniel Ingersol says,—\r\n\r\n\"This deponent testifieth, that, when my father had fenced in a parcel\r\nof land where the wolf-pits now are, the said Governor Endicott came to\r\nmy father where we were at plough, and said to my father he had fenced\r\nin some of the said Governor's land. My father replied, then he would\r\nremove the fence. No, said Governor Endicott, let it stand; and, when\r\nyou set up a new fence, we will settle in the bounds.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement is worthy of being preserved, as it illustrates the\r\ncharacter of the two men, exhibiting them in a most honorable light.\r\nThe gentlemanly bearing of each is quite observable. Ingersol manifests\r\nan instant willingness to repair a wrong, and set the matter right;\r\nEndicott is considerate and obliging on a point where men are most\r\nprone to be obstinate and unyielding,—a conflict of land rights: both\r\nare courteous, and disposed to accommodate. Endicott was governor of\r\nthe colony, and a large conterminous landowner; Ingersol was a\r\nhusbandman, at work with his boys on land into which their labor had\r\nincorporated value, and with which, for the time being, he was\r\nidentified. But Endicott showed no arrogance,[i.37] and assumed no\r\nauthority; Ingersol manifested no resentment or irritation. If a\r\nsimilar spirit had been everywhere exhibited, the good-will and harmony\r\nof neighborhoods would never have been disturbed, and the records of\r\ncourts reduced to less than half their bulk.\r\n\r\nTo his dying day, John Endicott retained a lively interest in promoting\r\nthe welfare of his neighbors in the vicinity of the Orchard Farm.\r\n\r\nFather Gabriel Druillettes was sent by the Governor of Canada, in 1650,\r\nto Boston, in a diplomatic character, to treat with the Government\r\nhere. He kept a journal, during his visit, from which the following is\r\nan extract: \"I went to Salem to speak to the Sieur Indicatt who speaks\r\nand understands French well, and is a good friend of the nation, and\r\nvery desirous to have his children entertain this sentiment. Finding I\r\nhad no money, he supplied me, and gave me an invitation to the\r\nmagistrates' table.\" Endicott had undoubtedly received a good\r\neducation. His natural force of character had been brought under the\r\ninfluence of the knowledge prevalent in his day, and invigorated by an\r\nexperience and aptitude in practical affairs. There is some evidence\r\nthat he had, in early life, been a surgeon or physician.\r\n\r\nHe was a captain in the military service before leaving England.\r\nAlthough he was the earliest who bore the title of governor here,\r\nhaving been deputed to exercise that office by the governor and company\r\nin England, and subsequently elected to that station[i.38] for a\r\ngreater length of time than any other person in our history, had been\r\ncolonel of the Essex militia, commandant of the expedition against the\r\nIndians at Block Island, and, for several years, major-general, at the\r\nhead of the military forces of the colony, the title of captain was\r\nattached to him, more or less, from beginning to end; and it is a\r\nsingular circumstance, that it has adhered to the name to this day. His\r\ndescendants early manifested a predilection for maritime life. During\r\nthe first half of the present century, many of them were shipmasters.\r\nIn our foreign, particularly our East-India, navigation, the title has\r\nclung to the name; so much so, that the story is told, that, half a\r\ncentury ago, when American ships arrived at Sumatra or Java, the\r\nnatives, on approaching or entering the vessels to ascertain the name\r\nof the captain, were accustomed to inquire, \"Who is the Endicott?\" The\r\npublic station, rank, and influence of Governor Endicott required that\r\nhe should first be mentioned, in describing the elements that went to\r\nform the character of the original agricultural population of this\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nThe map shows the farm of Emanuel Downing. The lines are substantially\r\ncorrect, although precise accuracy cannot be claimed for them, as the\r\npoints mentioned in this and other cases were marked trees, heaps of\r\nstones, or other perishable or removable objects, and no survey or plot\r\nhas come down to us. A collation of conterminous grants or subsequent\r\nconveyances, with references in some of them to[i.39] permanent\r\nobjects, enables us to approximate to a pretty certain conclusion. This\r\ngentleman was one of the most distinguished of the early New-England\r\ncolonists. He was a lawyer of the Inner Temple. He married, in the\r\nfirst instance, a daughter of Sir James Ware, a person of great\r\neminence in the learned lore of his times. His second wife was Lucy,\r\nsister of Governor Winthrop of Massachusetts, who was born July 9,\r\n1601. They were married, April 10, 1622. There seems to have been a\r\nvery strong attachment between Emanuel Downing and his brother\r\nWinthrop; and they went together, with their whole heart, into the plan\r\nof building up the colony. They devoted to it their fortunes and lives.\r\nDowning is supposed to have arrived at Boston in August, 1638, with his\r\nfamily. On the 4th of November, he and his wife were admitted to the\r\nChurch at Salem. So great had been the value of his services in behalf\r\nof the colony, in defending its interests and watching over its welfare\r\nbefore leaving England, that he was welcomed with the utmost cordiality\r\nto his new home. His nephew, John Winthrop, Jr., afterwards Governor of\r\nConnecticut, was associated with John Endicott to administer to him the\r\nfreeman's oath. The General Court granted him six hundred acres of\r\nland. He was immediately appointed a judge of the local court in Salem,\r\nand, for many years, elected one of its two deputies to the General\r\nCourt. In anticipation of his arrival in the country, the town of\r\nSalem, on the 16th of July, granted him five hundred acres. He\r\nafter[i.40]wards purchased the farm on which he seems to have lived,\r\nfor the most part, until he went to England in 1652. The condition of\r\npublic affairs, and his own connection with them, detained him in the\r\nmother-country much of the latter part of his life. While in this\r\ncolony, he was indefatigable in his exertions to secure its prosperity.\r\nHis wealth and time and faculties were liberally and constantly devoted\r\nto this end.\r\n\r\nThe active part taken by Mr. Downing in the affairs of the settlement\r\nis illustrated in the following extract from the Salem town records:—\r\n\r\n\"At a general Town meeting, held the 7th day of the 5th month,\r\n1644—ordered that two be appointed every Lord's Day, to walk forth in\r\nthe time of God's worship, to take notice of such as either lye about\r\nthe meeting house, without attending to the word and ordinances, or\r\nthat lye at home or in the fields without giving good account thereof,\r\nand to take the names of such persons, and to present them to the\r\nmagistrates, whereby they may be accordingly proceeded against. The\r\nnames of such as are ordered to this service are for the 1st day, Mr.\r\nStileman and Philip Veren Jr. 2d day, Philip Veren Sr. and Hilliard\r\nVeren. 3d day, Mr. Batter and Joshua Veren. 4th day, Mr. Johnson and\r\nMr. Clark. 5th day, Mr. Downing and Robert Molton Sr. 6th day, Robert\r\nMolton Jr. and Richard Ingersol. 7th day, John Ingersol and Richard\r\nPettingell. 8th day, William Haynes and Richard Hutchinson. 9th day,\r\nJohn Putnam and John Hathorne. 10th day, Townsend Bishop and Daniel\r\nRea. 11th day, John Porter and Jacob Barney.\" [i.41]\r\n\r\nEach patrol, on concluding its day's service, was to notify the\r\nsucceeding one; and they were to start on their rounds, severally, from\r\n\"Goodman Porter's near the Meeting House.\"\r\n\r\nThe men appointed to this service were all leading characters, reliable\r\nand energetic persons. It was a singular arrangement, and gives a vivid\r\nidea of the state of things at the time. Its design was probably, not\r\nmerely that expressed in the vote of the town, but also to prevent any\r\ndisorderly conduct on the part of those not attending public worship,\r\nand to give prompt alarm in case of fire or an Indian assault. The\r\npopulation had not then spread out far into the country; and the range\r\nof exploration did not much extend beyond the settlement in the town.\r\nNone but active men, however, could have performed the duty thoroughly,\r\nand in all directions, so as to have kept the whole community under\r\nstrict inspection.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing probably expended liberally his fortune and time in\r\nimproving his farm, upon which there were, at least, four\r\ndwelling-houses prior to 1661, and large numbers of men employed. He\r\nwas a ready contributor to all public objects. His education had been\r\nsuperior and his attainments in knowledge extensive. He was of an\r\nenlightened spirit, and strove to mitigate the severity of the\r\nprocedures against Antinomians and others. He seems to have had an\r\ningenious and enterprising mind. At a General Court held at Boston,\r\nSept. 6, 1638, it was voted that, \"Whereas Emanuel Downing, Esq., hath\r\nbrought[i.42] over, at his great charges, all things fitting for taking\r\nwild fowl by way of duck-coy, this court, being desirous to encourage\r\nhim and others in such designs as tend to the public good,\" &c., orders\r\nthat liberty shall be given him to set up his duck-coy within the\r\nlimits of Salem; and all persons are forbidden to molest him in his\r\nexperiments, by \"shooting in any gun within half a mile of the ponds,\"\r\nwhere, by the regulations of the town, he shall be allowed to place the\r\ndecoys. The court afterwards granted to other towns liberty to set up\r\nduck-coys, with similar privileges. What was the particular structure\r\nof the contrivance, and how far it succeeded in operation, is not\r\nknown; but the thing shows the spirit of the man. He at once took hold\r\nof his farm with energy, and gathered workmen upon it. Winthrop in his\r\njournal has this entry, Aug. 2, 1645:—\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Downing having built a new house at his farm, he being gone to\r\nEngland, and his wife and family gone to the church meeting on the\r\nLord's day, the chimney took fire and burned down the house, and\r\nbedding, apparel and household, to the value of 200 pounds.\"\r\n\r\nThis proves that his family resided on the farm; and it indicates,\r\nthat, when he first occupied it, he had only such a house as could have\r\nbeen seasonably put up at the start, but that a more commodious one had\r\nbeen erected at his leisure: the expression \"having built a new house\"\r\nappears to carry this idea. On his return from England, he undoubtedly\r\nbuilt again, and[i.43] had other houses for his workmen and tenants;\r\nfor we find that one of them, in 1648, was allowed to keep an ordinary,\r\n\"as Mr. Downing's farm, on the road between Lynn and Ipswich, was a\r\nconvenient place\" for such an accommodation to travellers. Public\r\ntravel to and from those points goes over that same road to-day. That\r\nit was so early laid out is probably owing to the fact, that such men\r\nas Emanuel Downing were on its route, and John Winthrop, Jr., at\r\nIpswich. Downing called his farm \"Groton,\" in dear remembrance of his\r\nwife's ancestral home in \"the old country.\"\r\n\r\nOriginally, travel was on a track more interior. The opening of roads\r\ndid not begin until after the more immediate and necessary operations\r\nof erecting houses and bringing the land, on the most available spots\r\nnear them at the points first settled, under culture. Originally,\r\ncommunication from farm to farm, through the woods, was by marking the\r\ntrees,—sometimes by burning and blackening spots on their sides, and\r\nsometimes by cutting off a piece of the bark. The traveller found his\r\nway step by step, following the trees thus marked, or \"blazed,\" as it\r\nwas called whichever method had been adopted. When the branches and\r\nbrush were sufficiently cleared away, horses could be used. At places\r\nrendered difficult by large roots, partly above ground, intercepting\r\nthe passage, or by rough stones, the rider would dismount, and lead the\r\nhorse. From this, it was called a \"bridle-path.\" After the way had\r\nbecome sufficiently opened for ox-carts or other vehicles to pass, it\r\nwould begin to receive the name of a[i.44] road. On reaching a cleared\r\nand fenced piece of land, the traveller would cross it, opening and\r\nclosing gates, or taking down and replacing bars, as the case might be.\r\nThere were arrangements among the settlers, and, before long, acts of\r\nthe General Court, regulating the matter. This was the origin of what\r\nwere called \"press-roads,\" or \"farm-roads,\" or \"gate-roads.\" When a\r\nproprietor concluded it to be for his interest to do so, he would fence\r\nin the road on both sides where it crossed his land, and remove the\r\ngates or bars from each end. Ultimately, the road, if convenient for\r\nlong travel, would be fenced in for a great distance, and become a\r\npermanent \"public highway.\" In all these stages of progress, it would\r\nbe called a \"highway.\" The fee would remain with the several\r\nproprietors through whose lands it passed; and, if travel should\r\nforsake it for a more eligible route, it would be discontinued, and the\r\nroad-track, enclosed in the fields to which it originally belonged, be\r\nobliterated by the plough. Many of the \"highways,\" by which the farmers\r\npassed over each other's lands to get to the meeting-house or out to\r\npublic roads, in 1692, have thus disappeared, while some have hardened\r\ninto permanent public roads used to this day. When thus fully and\r\nfinally established, it became a \"town road,\" and if leading some\r\ndistance into the interior, and through other towns, was called a\r\n\"country road.\" The early name of \"path\" continued some time in use\r\nlong after it had got to be worthy of a more pretentious title. The old\r\n\"Boston Path,\" by which the country was originally[i.45] penetrated,\r\nlong retained that name. It ran through the southern and western part\r\nof Salem Village by the Gardners, Popes, Goodales, Flints, Needhams,\r\nSwinnertons, Houltons, and so on towards Ipswich and Newbury.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of September, 1648, Governor Winthrop, writing to his son\r\nJohn, says \"they are well at Salem, and your uncle is now beginning to\r\ndistil. Mr. Endicott hath found a copper mine in his own ground. Mr.\r\nLeader hath tried it. The furnace runs eight tons per week, and their\r\nbar iron is as good as Spanish.\" Whatever may be thought by some of the\r\nlogic which infers that \"all is well\" in Salem, because they are\r\nbeginning \"to distil;\" and however little has, as yet, resulted here\r\nfrom the discovery of copper-mines, or the manufacture of iron, the\r\nforegoing extract shows the zeal and enthusiasm with which the\r\nwealthier settlers were applying themselves to the development of the\r\ncapabilities of the country.\r\n\r\nMr. Downing seems to have resided permanently on his farm, and to have\r\nbeen identified with the agricultural portion of the community. His\r\nhouse-lot in the town bounded south on Essex Street, extending from\r\nNewbury to St. Peter's Street. He may not, perhaps, have built upon it\r\nfor some time, as it long continued to be called \"Downing's Field.\" Two\r\nof his daughters married sons of Thomas Gardner: Mary married Samuel;\r\nand Ann, Joseph. They came into possession of the \"Downing Field.\" Mary\r\nwas the mother of John, the progenitor of a large branch of[i.46] the\r\nGardner family. Mr. Downing had another large lot in the town, which,\r\non the 11th of February, 1641, was sold to John Pickering, described in\r\nthe deed as follows: \"All that parcel of ground, lying before the now\r\ndwelling-house of the said John Pickering, late in the occupation of\r\nJohn Endicott, Esq., with all the appurtenances thereunto belonging,\r\nabutting on the east and south on the river commonly called the South\r\nRiver, and on the west on the land of William Hathorne, and on the\r\nnorth on the Town Common.\" The deed is signed by Lucy Downing, and by\r\nEdmund Batter, acting for her husband in his absence. On the 10th of\r\nFebruary, 1644, he indorsed the transaction as follows: \"I do freely\r\nagree to the sale of the said Field in Salem, made by my wife to John\r\nPickering: witness my hand,\" &c. The attesting witnesses were Samuel\r\nSharpe and William Hathorne. This land was then called \"Broad Field.\"\r\nOn his estate, thus enlarged, Pickering, a few years afterwards, built\r\na house, still standing. The estate has remained, or rather so much of\r\nit as was attached to the homestead, in that family to this day, and is\r\nnow owned and occupied by John Pickering, Esq., son of the eminent\r\nscholar and philologist of that name, and grandson of Colonel Timothy\r\nPickering, of Revolutionary fame,—the trusted friend of Washington.\r\n\r\nEmanuel Downing was the father of Sir George Downing, one of the first\r\nclass that graduated at Harvard College,—a man of extraordinary talents\r\nand wonderful fortunes. After finishing his collegiate[i.47] course, in\r\n1642, he studied divinity, probably under the direction of Hugh Peters;\r\nwent to the West Indies, acting as chaplain in the vessel; preached and\r\nreceived calls to settle in several places; went on to England; entered\r\nthe parliamentary service as chaplain to a regiment; was rapidly drawn\r\ninto notice, and promoted from point to point, until he became\r\nscoutmaster-general in Cromwell's army. This office seems to have\r\ncombined the functions of inspector and commissary-general, and head of\r\nthe reconnoitering department. In 1654, he was married to Frances,\r\nsister of Viscount Morpeth, afterwards Earl of Carlisle; thus uniting\r\nhimself with \"the blood of all the Howards,\" one of the noblest\r\nfamilies in England. The nuptials were celebrated with great pomp, an\r\nepithalamium in Latin, &c. All this, within eleven years after he took\r\nhis degree at Harvard, is surely an extraordinary instance of rising in\r\nthe world. He was a member of Parliament for Scotland. Cromwell sent\r\nhim to France on diplomatic business, and his correspondence in Latin\r\nfrom that court was the beginning of a career of great services in that\r\nline. He was soon commissioned ambassador to the Hague, then the great\r\ncourt in Europe. Thurlow's state papers show with what marvellous\r\nvigilance, activity, and efficiency he conducted, from that centre, the\r\ndiplomatic affairs of the commonwealth. At the restoration of the\r\nmonarchy, he made the quickest and the loftiest somersault in all\r\npolitical history. It was done between two days. He saw Charles the\r\nSecond at the Hague, on his way to England to re[i.48]sume his crown:\r\nand the man who, up to that moment, had been one of the most zealous\r\nsupporters of the commonwealth, came out next morning as an equally\r\nzealous supporter of the king. He accompanied this wonderful exploit by\r\nan act of treachery to three of his old associates,—including Colonel\r\nOakey, in whose regiment he had served as chaplain,—which cost them\r\ntheir lives. He was forthwith knighted, and his commission as\r\nambassador renewed. After a while, he returned to England; went into\r\nParliament from Morpeth, and ever after the exchequer was in his hands.\r\nBy his knowledge, skill, and ability, he enlarged the financial\r\nresources of the country, multiplied its manufactures, and extended its\r\npower and wealth. He was probably the original contriver of the policy\r\nenforced in the celebrated Navigation Act, having suggested it in\r\nCromwell's time. By that single short act of Parliament, England became\r\nthe great naval power of the world; her colonial possessions, however\r\nwidely dispersed, were consolidated into one vast fountain of wealth to\r\nthe imperial realm; the empire of the seas was fixed on an immovable\r\nbasis, and the proud Hollander compelled to take down the besom from\r\nthe mast-head of his high-admiral.\r\n\r\nSir George Downing did one thing in favor of the power of the people,\r\nin the British system of government, which may mitigate the resentment\r\nof mankind for his execrable seizure and delivery to the royal\r\nvengeance of Oakey, Corbett, and Barkstead. He introduced into\r\nParliament and established the prin[i.49]ciple of Specific\r\nAppropriations. The House of Commons has, ever since, not only held the\r\nkeys of the treasury, but the power of controlling expenditures. The\r\nfortune of Sir George, on the failure of issue in the third generation,\r\nwent to the foundation of Downing College, in Cambridge, England. It\r\namounted to one hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling. It is not\r\nimprobable, that Downing Street, in London, owes its name to the great\r\ndiplomatist.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable man spent his later youth and opening manhood on Salem\r\nFarms. In his college vacations and intervals of study, he partook,\r\nperhaps, in the labors of the plantation, mingled with the rural\r\npopulation, and shared in their sports. The crack of his fowling-piece\r\nre-echoed through the wild woods beyond Procter's Corner; he tended his\r\nfather's duck-coys at Humphries' Pond, and angled along the clear\r\nbrooks. It is an observable circumstance, as illustrating the\r\ntransmission of family traits, that the same ingenious activity and\r\nversatility of mind, which led Emanuel Downing, while carrying on the\r\nmultifarious operations of opening a large farm in the forest,\r\npresiding in the local court at Salem, and serving year after year in\r\nthe General Court as a deputy, to contrive complicated machinery for\r\ntaking wild fowl and getting up distilleries, re-appeared in his son,\r\non the broader field of the manufactures, finances, and foreign\r\nrelations of a great nation.\r\n\r\nA tract of three hundred acres, next eastward of the Downing farm, was\r\ngranted to Thomas Read. He[i.50] became a freeman in 1634, was a member\r\nof the Salem Church in 1636, received his grant the same year, and was\r\nacknowledged as an inhabitant, May 2, 1637. The farm is now occupied\r\nand owned by the Hon. Richard S. Rogers. It is a beautiful and\r\ncommanding situation, and attests the taste of its original proprietor.\r\nMr. Read seems to have had a passion for military affairs. In 1636, he\r\nwas ensign in a regiment composed of men from Saugus, Ipswich, Newbury,\r\nand Salem, of which John Endicott was colonel, and John Winthrop, Jr.,\r\nlieutenant-colonel. In 1647, he commanded a company. During the civil\r\nwars in England, he was attracted back to his native country. He\r\ncommanded a regiment in 1660, and held his place after the Restoration.\r\nHe died about 1663.\r\n\r\nOur antiquarians were long at a loss to understand a sentence in one of\r\nRoger Williams's letters to John Winthrop, Jr., in which he says, \"Sir,\r\nyou were not long since the son of two noble fathers, Mr. John Winthrop\r\nand Mr. Hugh Peters.\" How John Winthrop, Jr., could be a son of Hugh\r\nPeters was the puzzle. Peters was not the father of either of\r\nWinthrop's two wives; and there was nothing in any family records or\r\nmemorials to justify the notion. On the contrary, they absolutely\r\nprecluded it. By the labors and acumen of the Hon. James Savage and Mr.\r\nCharles Deane, of Cambridge, who have no superiors in grappling with\r\nsuch a difficulty, its solution seems, at last, to be reached. \"After\r\nlong fruitless search,\" Mr. Savage has expressed a conviction that Mr.\r\nDeane has \"ac[i.51]quired the probable explication.\" The clue was thus\r\nobtained: Mr. Savage says, \"This approach to explanation is gained from\r\n'the Life and Death of Hugh Peters, by William Yonge, Dr. Med. London.\r\n1663,' a very curious and more scarce tract.\" The facts discovered are\r\nthat Peters taught a free school at Maldon, in Essex; and that a widow\r\nlady with children and an estate of two or three hundred pounds a year\r\nbefriended him. She was known as \"Mistress Read.\" Peters married her.\r\nThe second wife of John Winthrop, Jr., was Elizabeth, daughter of\r\nColonel Read, of Essex. By marrying Mrs. Read, Peters became the\r\nstep-father of the younger Winthrop's wife; and, by the usage of that\r\nday, he would be called Winthrop's father.\r\n\r\nA few additional particulars, in reference to Peters and our Salem\r\nRead, may shed further light on the subject. While a prisoner in the\r\nTower of London, awaiting the trial which, in a few short days,\r\nconsigned him to his fate, Peters wrote \"A Dying Father's Last Legacy\r\nto an only Child,\" and delivered it to his daughter just before his\r\nexecution. This is one of the most admirable productions of genius,\r\nwisdom, and affection, anywhere to be found. In it he gives a condensed\r\nhistory of his life, which enables us to settle some questions, which\r\nhave given rise to conflicting statements, and kept some points in his\r\nbiography in obscurity. In the first place, the title proves that he\r\nhad, at the time of his death, no other child. In the course of it, he\r\ntells his daughter, that, when he was[i.52] fourteen years of age, his\r\nmother, then a widow, removed with him to Cambridge, and connected him\r\nwith the University there. His elder brother had been sent to Oxford\r\nfor his education. After residing eight years in Cambridge, he took his\r\nMaster's degree, and then went up to London, where he was \"struck with\r\nthe sense of his sinful estate by a sermon he heard under Paul's, which\r\nwas about forty years since, which text was the _burden of Dumah or\r\nIdumea_, and stuck fast. This made me to go into Essex; and after being\r\nquieted by another sermon in that country, and the love and labors of\r\nMr. Thomas Hooker, I there preached, there married with a good\r\ngentlewoman, till I went to London to ripen my studies, not intending\r\nto preach at all.\" He then relates the circumstances which subsequently\r\nled him again to engage in preaching. He is stated to have been born in\r\n1599: his death was in 1660. Putting together these dates and facts, it\r\nbecomes evident that he could not have been more than twenty-two years\r\nof age when he married \"Mistress Read.\" The \"Last Legacy\" shows, not\r\nmerely in the manner in which he speaks of her,—\"a good\r\ngentlewoman,\"—but, in its express terms, that she was not the mother of\r\nthe \"only child\" to whom it was addressed. \"Besides your mother,\" he\r\nstates that he had had \"a godly wife before.\" There is no indication\r\nthat there were children by the earlier marriage. If there were, they\r\ndied young. He married, for his second wife, Deliverance Sheffield, at\r\nBoston, in March, 1639.[i.53]\r\n\r\nHis first wife, the time of whose death is unknown, had left the\r\nchildren by her former husband in his hands and under his care. He\r\nevidently cherished the memory of the \"good gentlewoman of Essex\" with\r\nthe tenderest and most sacred affection. She had not only been the dear\r\nwife of his youth, but her property placed him above want. No wonder\r\nthat the strongest attachment existed between him and her children.\r\nJohn Winthrop, Jr., and his wife, called him father, not merely in\r\nconformity with custom, being their step-father in point of fact, but\r\nwith the fondness and devotion of actual children. It was on account of\r\nthis intimate and endeared connection, and in consideration of the\r\npecuniary benefit he had derived from his marriage to the mother of the\r\nyounger Winthrop's wife, that he made arrangements, in case he should\r\nnot return to America, that his Salem property should go to her and her\r\nhusband. Having married a second wife, and there being issue of said\r\nmarriage, he would not have alienated so considerable a part of his\r\nproperty from the legal heir without some good and sufficient reason.\r\nThe foregoing view of the case explains the whole. The solution of the\r\nmystery which had enveloped Roger Williams's language is complete.\r\nElizabeth, the daughter of the second marriage, to whom the \"Last\r\nLegacy\" was addressed, was baptized in the First Church at Salem, on\r\nthe 8th of March, 1640. It does not appear, that, during her subsequent\r\nlife, there was any intimacy, or even acquaintance, between her and\r\nthe[i.54] Winthrops, as there was no ground for it, she being in no way\r\nconnected with them.\r\n\r\nMay not Thomas Read, of Salem, have been a son of Colonel Read, of\r\nMaldon in Essex, and a brother of the wife of the younger Winthrop?\r\nPeters says, in the \"Last Legacy,\" \"Many of my acquaintances, going for\r\nNew England, had engaged me to come to them when they sent, which\r\naccordingly I did.\" Thomas Read came over some time before him; so did\r\nJohn Winthrop, Jr., and wife. They were the same as children to him.\r\nThey sent for him, and he came. After it was ascertained and determined\r\nthat Peters should settle in Salem, Read joined the church here, and\r\nbecame a full inhabitant. Peters located his grant of land in sight of\r\nRead's residence, on the next then unappropriated territory, at a\r\ndistance of about two and a half miles. When Read returned to England,\r\nhe left his property here in the care of the Winthrops. Wait Winthrop,\r\nas the agent and attorney of his heirs, sold it to Daniel Eppes. If, as\r\nI conjecture, Thomas Read was a son of Colonel Read, of Essex, his\r\ncoming here with Peters, and his connection with the Winthrops, are\r\naccounted for. His strong predilection for military affairs was natural\r\nin a son of a colonel of the English army. It led him back to the\r\nmother-country, on the first sound of the great civil war reaching\r\nthese shores, and raised him to the rank he finally attained. The\r\nconjecture that he was a brother of the wife of the younger Winthrop is\r\nfavored by the fact, that her son, Fitz John Win[i.55]throp, was a\r\ncaptain in Read's regiment, at the time of the restoration of the\r\nStuarts.\r\n\r\nDuring the short period of the residence of Hugh Peters in America,\r\nprofessional duties, and the extent to which his great talents were\r\ncalled upon in ecclesiastical and political affairs, in all parts of\r\nthe colony, left him but little opportunity to attend to his\r\ntwo-hundred-acre grant. It was to the north of the present village of\r\nDanvers Plains, on the eastern side and adjoining to Frost-Fish Brook.\r\nThe history of this grant confirms the supposition of his particular\r\nconnection with the family of the younger Winthrop. It seems that it\r\nhad not been formally laid out by metes and bounds while Peters was\r\nhere. Owing to this circumstance, perhaps, it escaped confiscation at\r\nthe time of his condemnation and execution. Some years afterwards, June\r\n4, 1674, a committee of the town laid out the grant \"to Mr. Peters.\"\r\nThe record of this transaction says, \"The land is in the possession of\r\nJohn Corwin.\" Captain John Corwin had married, in May, 1665, Margaret,\r\ndaughter of John Winthrop, Jr. She survived her husband, and sold the\r\nsame land, May 22, 1693, to \"Henry Brown, Jr., of Salisbury, yeoman.\"\r\nThese facts show that this portion of Mr. Peters's lands did go,\r\naccording to the agreement when he left America, to the family of John\r\nWinthrop, Jr.\r\n\r\nWhether he had erected a house on this grant is not known. From his\r\ncharacteristic energy, activity, and promptitude, it is probable that\r\nhe had begun to clear[i.56] it. In agriculture, as in every thing else,\r\nhe gave a decisive impulse. It is stated that he had a particular\r\ndesign to attempt the culture of hemp. He introduced many implements of\r\nlabor, and started new methods of improvement. He disclosed to the\r\nproducer of agricultural growths the idea of raising what the land was\r\nmost capable of yielding in abundance, in greater quantities than were\r\nneeded for local consumption, and finding for the surplus an outside\r\nmarket. He is allowed to have introduced the coasting and foreign trade\r\non an intelligent and organized basis, and to have promoted\r\nship-building and the export of the products of the forests and the\r\nfields generally to the Southern plantations, the West Indies, and even\r\nmore distant points. If he had remained longer in the country, the\r\nfarming interests, and the settlers in what was afterwards called Salem\r\nVillage, within which his tract was situated, would have felt his great\r\ninfluence. As it was, he undoubtedly did much to inspire a zeal for\r\nimprovement. His town residence was on the south-western corner of\r\nEssex and Washington Street, then known as \"Salem Corner,\" where the\r\noffice of the Horse-railroad Company now is. The lot was a quarter of\r\nan acre. Roger Williams probably had resided there, and sold to Peters,\r\nwho was his successor in the ministry of the First Church, and whose\r\nattorney sold it to Benjamin Felton, in 1659. The range of ground\r\nincluded within what are now Washington, Essex, Summer, and Chestnut\r\nStreets, and extending to the South River, as it was before any[i.57]\r\ndam or mills had been erected over or across it, was a beautiful swell\r\nof land, with sloping surfaces, intersected by a creek from near the\r\nfoot of Chestnut Street to its junction with the South River under the\r\npresent grade of Mill Street. To the south of the corner, occupied\r\nsuccessively by Roger Williams and Hugh Peters, Ralph Fogg, the Lady\r\nDeborah Moody, George Corwin, Dr. George Emory, Thomas Ruck, Samuel\r\nSkelton, Endicott, Pickering, Downing, and Hathorne, each had lots,\r\nextending in order to the foot of what is now Phelps Street. Most, if\r\nnot all of them, had houses on their lots. Elder Sharp had what was\r\ncalled \"Sharp's Field,\" bordering on the north side of Essex Street,\r\nextending from Washington to North Streets. His house was at the north\r\ncorner of Lynde and Washington Streets. Edmund Batter, Henry Cook, Dr.\r\nDaniel Weld, Stephen Sewall, and Edward Norris, were afterwards on his\r\nland. Hugh Peters also owned the lot, consisting of a quarter of an\r\nacre, on the north-eastern corner of Essex and Washington Streets, now\r\noccupied by what is known as Stearns's Building, and was preparing to\r\nerect a house upon it when he was sent to England. His attorney sold\r\nit, in 1652, to John Orne, the founder of the family of that name.\r\n\r\nThe daughter of Mr. Peters came over to America shortly after his\r\ndeath, bringing with her her mother, who, for many years, had been\r\nsubject to derangement. They were kindly received; and some of his\r\nproperty, particularly a valuable farm in the vicinity[i.58] of\r\nMarblehead, which the daughter sold to the American ancestor of the\r\nDevereux family, was recovered from the effect of his attainder. She\r\nprobably soon went back to England, where she spent her days. Papers on\r\nfile in the county court show that Elizabeth Barker, widow, \"daughter\r\nof Mr. Hugh Peters,\" was living, in March, 1702, in good health, at\r\nDeptford, Kent, in the immediate vicinity of London, and had been\r\nliving there for about forty years.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, perhaps, of the intimate connection between Mr. Peters\r\nand the family of John Winthrop, Jr., the name of the latter is to be\r\nadded to the cluster of eminent men who, at that time, were drawn to\r\nreside in Salem. He was here, it is quite certain, from 1638 to 1641,\r\nif not for a longer period. There are indications of his presence as\r\nearly as March of the former year, when he was appointed with Endicott\r\nto administer the freeman's oath to his uncle Downing. On the 25th of\r\nthe next June, he had liberty to set up a salt-house at Royal Neck, on\r\nthe east side of Wooleston River. There he erected a dwelling-house and\r\nother buildings, as appears by the depositions of sundry persons in a\r\nland suit about thirty years afterwards, who state that they worked for\r\nhim, and were conversant with him there for several years. His first\r\nexperiments and enterprises in the salt-manufacture, which he\r\nsubsequently conducted on a very extensive scale in Connecticut, were\r\nperformed at Royal Neck. His daughter, the widow successively of\r\nAntipas Newman and Zerubabel Endicott, in the suit just\r\nmen[i.59]tioned, recovered possession of that property, comprising\r\nforty acres, with the buildings and improvements. In 1646, John\r\nWinthrop, Jr., accompanied by a brother of Hugh Peters, Rev. Thomas\r\nPeters from Cornwall in England, began a plantation at Pequot River;\r\nand Trumbull, in his \"History of Connecticut,\" says that \"Mr. Thomas\r\nPeters was the first minister of Saybrook.\" The fortunes and families\r\nof Hugh Peters and John Winthrop, Jr., seem all along to have been\r\nlinked together.\r\n\r\nDowning, Read, and Peters, three of the original planters of Salem\r\nFarms, were drawn back to England and kept there by the engrossing\r\ninterest which the wonderful revolution then breaking out in that\r\nkingdom could not but awaken in such minds as theirs. Here and\r\neverywhere, a great check was given to the early progress of the\r\ncountry by the turn of the tide which carried such men back to England,\r\nand prevented others from coming over. If the Parliament had not\r\nattempted to arrest the usurpations of the crown at that time, and the\r\nStuarts been suffered to establish an absolute monarchy, the eyes and\r\nhearts of all free spirits would have remained fixed on America, and a\r\nperpetual stream of emigration brought over, for generations and for\r\never, thousands upon thousands of such men as came at the beginning.\r\nThe effects that would have been thus produced in America and in\r\nEngland, in accelerating the progress of society here, and sinking it\r\ninto debasement there; and thereby upon the fortunes of mankind the\r\nworld[i.60] over, is a subject on which a meditative and philosophical\r\nmind may well be exercised.\r\n\r\nBut, although these men were lost, others are worthy of being\r\nenumerated, in forming an estimate of the elements that went to make\r\nthe character of the people, a chapter in whose history, of awful\r\nimport, we are preparing ourselves to explore.\r\n\r\nFrancis Weston was a leading man at the very beginning. In 1634, with\r\nRoger Conant and John Holgrave, he represented Salem in the first House\r\nof Deputies ever assembled. His land grant was some little distance to\r\nthe west of the meeting-house of the village. He must have been a\r\nperson of more than ordinary liberality of spirit; for he\r\ndiscountenanced the intolerance of his age, and kept his mind open to\r\nreceive truth and light. He did not conceal his sympathy with those who\r\nsuffered for entertaining Antinomian sentiments. He was ordered to quit\r\nthe colony in 1638. For the same offence, his wife, who probably had\r\nrefused to go, was placed in the stocks \"two hours at Boston and two at\r\nSalem, on a lecture day.\" Weston, having ventured back, five years\r\nafterwards, was put in irons, and imprisoned to hard labor. But, as he\r\nstood to his principles, and there was danger to be apprehended from\r\nhis influence, he was again driven out of the colony.\r\n\r\nRichard Waterman came over from England in 1629, recommended to\r\nGovernor Endicott by the governor and deputy in London. He was a noted\r\nhunter. \"His chief employment,\" says the letter introducing[i.61] him\r\nto Endicott, \"will be to get you good venison.\" A land grant was\r\nassigned him near Davenport's Hill. But he, too, had a spirit that\r\nresisted the severe and arbitrary policy of the times. He became a\r\ndissenter from the prevalent creed, and sympathized with those who\r\nsuffered oppression. In 1664, he was brought before the court,\r\ncondemned to imprisonment, and finally banished. Weston and Waterman\r\nsubsequently were conspicuous in Rhode-Island affairs. While residing\r\nin the village, the latter probably devoted himself to the opening of\r\nhis land, and the pursuit of game through the forests. I find but one\r\nnotice of him as connected with public affairs.\r\n\r\nFor some years, the settlements were necessarily confined to the shores\r\nof bays or coves, and the banks of rivers. There were no\r\nwheel-carriages of any kind, for transportation or travel, until\r\nsomething like roads could be made; and that was the work of time. A\r\nfew horses had been imported; but it was long before they could be\r\nraised to meet the general wants, or come much into use. Every thing\r\nhad to be water-borne. The only vehicles were boats or canoes, mostly\r\nthe latter. There were two kinds of canoes. Large white-pine logs were\r\nscooped or hollowed out, and wrought into suitable shape, about two and\r\na half feet in breadth and twenty in length. These were often quite\r\nconvenient and serviceable, but not to be compared with the Indian\r\ncanoes, which were made of the bark of trees, wrought with great skill\r\ninto a beautiful shape. The birch canoe was an admirable\r\nstruc[i.62]ture, combining elements and principles which modern naval\r\narchitecture may well study to imitate. In lightness, rapidity, freedom\r\nand ease of motion, it has not been, and cannot be, surpassed. Its\r\ndraft, even when bearing a considerable burden, was so slight, that it\r\nwould glide over the shallowest bars. It was strong, durable, and\r\neasily kept in repair. Although dangerous to the highest degree under\r\nan inexperienced and unskilful hand, no vessel has ever been safer when\r\nmanaged by persons trained to its use. The cool and quick-sighted\r\nIndian could guide it, with his exquisitely moulded paddle, in perfect\r\nsecurity, through whirling rapids and over heavy seas, around headlands\r\nand across bays. The settlers early supplied themselves with canoes, by\r\nwhich to thread the interior streams, and cross from shore to shore in\r\nthe harbors. One great advantage of the light canoe, before roads were\r\nopened through the woods, was, that it could be unloaded, and borne on\r\nthe shoulders across the land, at any point, to another stream or lake,\r\nthus cutting off long curves, and getting from river to river. The\r\nlading would be transported in convenient parcels, the canoe launched,\r\nloaded, and again be floated on its way. Canoes soon came into\r\nuniversal use, particularly in this neighborhood. Wood, in his\r\n\"New-England's Prospect,\" speaking of Salem, says, \"There be more\r\ncanowes in this town than in all the whole Patent, every household\r\nhaving a water horse or two.\" It was so important for the public safety\r\nto have them kept in good condition, that the town took the\r\nmatter[i.63] in hand. The quarterly court records have the following\r\nentry under the date of June 27, 1636:—\r\n\r\n\"It was ordered and agreed, that all the canoes of the north side of\r\nthe town shall be brought the next second day, being the 4th day of the\r\n5th month, about 9 o'clock, a.m., unto the cove of the common landing\r\nplace of the North River, by George Harris his house—And that all the\r\ncanoes of the south side are to be brought before the port-house in the\r\nSouth River, at the same time, then and there to be viewed by J.\r\nHolgrave, P. Palfrey, R. Waterman, R. Conant, P. Veren, or the greater\r\nnumber of them. And that there shall be no canoe used (upon penalty, of\r\nforty shillings, to the owner thereof) than such as the said surveyors\r\nshall allow of and set their mark upon; and if any shall refuse or\r\nneglect to bring their canoes to the said places at the time appointed,\r\nthey shall pay for said fault 10 shillings.\"\r\n\r\nThe names of the men associated with Waterman prove that he was ranked\r\namong the chief citizens of the town. The austere manners of the age,\r\namong communities like that established here; the exclusion, at that\r\ntime, by inexorable laws, of many forms of amusement; and the general\r\nsombre aspect of society, kept down the natural exhilaration of life to\r\nsuch a degree, that, when the pressure was occasionally removed, the\r\nwhole people bounded into the liveliest outbursts of glad excitement.\r\nIt was no doubt a gala day. Ceremony, sport, and festivity, in all\r\ntheir forms, took full effect. The surveyors performed their functions\r\nwith the utmost display of authority, examined the canoes with the\r\ngravest scrutiny, and affixed[i.64] their marks with all due formality.\r\nA light, graceful, and most picturesque fleet swarmed, from all\r\ndirections, to the appointed rendezvous. The harbor glittered with the\r\nflashing paddles, and was the scene of swift races and rival feats of\r\nskill, displaying manly strength and agility. It must have been an\r\naquatic spectacle of rare gayety and beauty, not surpassed nor equalled\r\nin some respects, when, more than a century afterwards, the \"Grand\r\nTurk\" or the \"Essex\" frigate was launched, or when Commodore Forbes,\r\nstill later, swept into our peaceful waters with his boat flotilla. It\r\nwas the first Fourth of July ever celebrated in America.\r\n\r\nThomas Scruggs was an early inhabitant of Salem; often represented the\r\ntown as deputy in the General Court; was one of the judges of the local\r\ncourt, and always recognized among the rulers of the town. In January,\r\n1636, he received a grant of three hundred acres on the south-west\r\nlimits of its territory. The next month, an exchange took place, which\r\nis thus recorded in the town-book of grants: \"It was ordered, that,\r\nwhereas Mr. Scruggs had a farm of three hundred acres beyond Forest\r\nRiver, and that Captain Trask had one of two hundred acres beyond Bass\r\nRiver, and Captain Trask freely relinquishing his farm of two hundred\r\nacres, it was granted unto Mr. Thomas Scruggs, and he thereupon freely\r\nrelinquished his farm of three hundred acres.\" This brought Scruggs\r\nupon the Salem Farms, between Bass River and the great pond, Wenham\r\nLake. The real object in making this arrangement was to advance a\r\nproject which the lead[i.65]ing people of Salem at that time had much\r\nat heart. They were very desirous to have the college established on\r\nthe tract relinquished by Scruggs. What would have been the effect of\r\nplacing it there, in the immediate neighborhood of the sea-shore, in\r\nfull view of the spacious bay, its promontories, islands, and\r\nnavigation, is a question on which we may speculate at our leisure. The\r\neffort failed: Captain Trask and Mr. Scruggs had done all they could to\r\naccomplish it, and gave their energies to the welfare of the community\r\nin other directions. From the little that is recorded of Scruggs, it is\r\nquite evident that he was an intelligent and valuable citizen. The\r\nevent that brought his career as a public man to a close proves that\r\nhis mind was enlightened, liberal, and independent; that he was in\r\nadvance of the times in which he lived. When the bitter and violent\r\npersecution of the celebrated Anne Hutchinson, on account of her\r\nAntinomian sentiments, took place, Mr. Scruggs disapproved and\r\ndenounced it. He gave his whole influence, earnestly and openly,\r\nagainst such attempts to suppress freedom of inquiry and the rights of\r\nconscience. He, with others in Salem, was proscribed, disarmed, and\r\ndeprived of his public functions. He appears to have been suffered to\r\nremain unmolested on his estate, and died there in 1654. He had but one\r\nchild, Rachel; and the name, as derived from him, became extinct. The\r\ninventory of his property is dated on the 24th of June of that year.\r\nThe items mentioned in it amount to £244. 10_s._ 2_d._\r\nConsider[i.66]ing the rates of value at that time, it was a large\r\nproperty. At the same date, an agreement is recorded by which his\r\nwidow, Margery, conveys to her son-in-law, John Raymond, all her real\r\nestate, upon these conditions: She to have the use of her house during\r\nher life, the bedding, and other \"household stuff;\" and he to pay her\r\nfive pounds \"in hand,\" twenty pounds per annum, and five pounds \"at the\r\nhour of her death.\" This was an ample provision, in those times, for\r\nher comfort while she lived, and for her funeral charges. I do not\r\nremember to have found this last point arranged for, in such a form of\r\nexpression, in any other instance.\r\n\r\nWilliam Alford was an early settler. He was a member of the numerous\r\nand wealthy society, or guild, of Skinners, in the city of London, and\r\nprobably came here with the view of establishing an extensive trade in\r\nfurs. He received accordingly, in 1636, a grant of two hundred acres,\r\nincluding what was for some time called Alford's Hill, afterwards Long\r\nHill, now known as Cherry Hill. It is owned and occupied by R.P.\r\nWaters, Esq. Alford sympathized in religious views with his neighbor\r\nScruggs, and with him was subjected to censure, and disarmed by order\r\nof the General Court. He sold his lands to Henry Herrick, and left the\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\nOne of the most enlightened, and perhaps most accomplished, men among\r\nthe first inhabitants of Salem Village, was Townsend Bishop. He was\r\nadmitted a freeman in 1635. The next year, he appears on the list of\r\nmembers of the Salem Church. He was one[i.67] of the judges of the\r\nlocal court, and, almost without intermission from his first coming\r\nhere, a deputy to the General Court. In 1645, as his attention had been\r\nled to the subject, he conceived doubts in reference to infant baptism;\r\nand it was noticed that he did not bring forward a child, recently\r\nborn, to the rite. Although himself on the bench, and ever before the\r\nobject of popular favor and public honors, he was at once brought up,\r\nand handed over for discipline. The next year, he sold his estates, and\r\nprobably removed elsewhere. He appears no more in our annals. Where he\r\nwent, I have not been able to learn. It is to be hoped that he found\r\nsomewhere a more congenial and tolerant abode. It is evident that he\r\ncould not breathe in an atmosphere of bigotry; and it was difficult to\r\nfind one free from the miasma in those days.\r\n\r\nFive of the most valuable of the first settlers of the village—Weston,\r\nWaterman, Scruggs, Alford, and Bishop—were thus early driven into\r\nexile, or subdued to silence, by the stern policy on which the colony\r\nwas founded. It is an error to characterize this as religious bigotry.\r\nIt was not so much a theological as a political persecution. Its\r\napparent form was in reference to tenets of faith, but the policy was\r\ndeeper than this. Any attempt to make opposition to the existing\r\nadministration was treated with equal severity, whatever might be the\r\nsubject on which it ventured to display itself.\r\n\r\nThe men who sought this far-off \"nook and corner of the world,\"\r\ncrossing a tempestuous and dangerous[i.68] ocean, and landing on the\r\nshores of a wilderness, leaving every thing, however dear and valuable,\r\nbehind, came to have a country and a social system for themselves and\r\nof themselves alone. Their resolve was inexorable not to allow the\r\nmother-country, or the whole outside world combined, to interfere with\r\nthem. And it was equally inexorable not to suffer dissent or any\r\ndiscordant element to get foothold among them. Sir Christopher\r\nGardner's rank and title could not save him: he was not of the sort\r\nthey wanted, and they shipped him back. Roger Williams's virtues,\r\nlearning, apostolic piety, could not save him; and they drove him into\r\na wintry wilderness, hunting him beyond their borders. It was not so\r\nmuch a question whether Baptists, Antinomians, or Quakers were right or\r\nwrong, as a preformed determination not to have any dissentients of any\r\ndescription among them. They had sacrificed all to find and to make a\r\ncountry for themselves, and they meant to keep it to themselves. They\r\nhad gone out of everybody else's way, and they did not mean to let\r\nanybody else come into their way. They did not understand the great\r\ntruth which Hugh Peters preached to Parliament, \"Why,\" said he, \"cannot\r\nChristians differ, and yet be friends? All children should be fed,\r\nthough they have different faces and shapes: unity, not uniformity, is\r\nthe Christian word.\" They admitted no such notion as this. They thought\r\nuniformity the only basis of unity. They meant to make and to keep this\r\na country after their own pattern, a Congregational, Puritan,\r\nCambridge-[i.69]Platform-man's country. The time has not yet come when\r\nwe can lift up clean hands against them. Two successive\r\nchief-magistrates of the United States have opened the door and\r\nsignified to one-eighth part of our whole people, that it will be best\r\nfor them to walk out. So long as the doctrine is maintained that this\r\nis the white man's country, or any man's, or any class or kind of men's\r\ncountry, it becomes us to close our lips against denunciation of the\r\nFathers of New England because they tried to keep the country to\r\nthemselves. The sentiment or notion on which they acted, in whatever\r\nform it appears, however high the station from which it emanates, or\r\nhowever long it lasts in the world, is equally false and detestable in\r\nall its shapes. It is a defiant rebellion against that law which\r\ndeclares that \"all nature's difference is all nature's peace;\" that\r\nthere can be no harmony without variety of sound, no social unity\r\nwithout unlimited freedom, and no true liberty where any are deprived\r\nof equal rights; that differences ought to bring men together, rather\r\nthan keep them apart; and that the only government that can stand\r\nagainst the shocks of time, and grow stronger and dearer to all its\r\npeople, is one that recognizes no differences of whatever kind among\r\nthem. The only consistent or solid foundation on which a republic or a\r\nchurch can be built, is an absolute level, with no enclosures and no\r\nexclusion.\r\n\r\nTownsend Bishop's grant of three hundred acres was made on the 16th of\r\nJanuary, 1636. When he sold it, Oct. 18, 1641, it appears by the deed,\r\nthat there[i.70] were on it edifices, gardens, yards, enclosures, and\r\nmeadows. A large force must have been put and kept upon it, from the\r\nfirst, to have produced such results in so short a time. Orchards had\r\nbeen planted. The manner in which the grounds were laid out is still\r\nindicated by embankments, with artificial slopes and roadways, which\r\nexhibit the fine taste of the proprietor, and must have required a\r\nlarge expenditure of money and labor. Although the estate has always\r\nbeen in the hands of owners competent to take care of it and keep it in\r\ngood preservation, none but the original proprietor would have been\r\nlikely to have made the outlay apparent on its face, on the plan\r\nadopted. The mansion in which he resided stands to-day. Its front,\r\nfacing the south, has apparently been widened, at some remote\r\nintermediate date since its original erection, by a slight extension on\r\nthe western end, beyond the porch. It has been otherwise, perhaps,\r\nsomewhat altered in the course of time by repairs; but its general\r\naspect, as exhibited in the frontispiece of this volume, and its\r\noriginal strongly compacted and imperishable frame, remain. No saw was\r\nused in shaping its timbers; they were all hewn, by the broad-axe, of\r\nthe most durable oak: they are massive, and rendered by time as hard to\r\npenetrate almost as iron. The walls and stairway of the cellar, the\r\nentrance to which is seen by the side of the porch, constructed of such\r\nstones as could be gathered on the surface of a new country, bear the\r\nmarks of great antiquity. A long, low kitchen, with a stud of\r\nscarcely[i.71] six feet, extended originally the whole length of the\r\nlean-to, on the north side of the house. The rooms of the main house\r\nwere of considerably higher stud. The old roadway, the outlines of\r\nwhich still remain, approached the house from the east, came up to its\r\nnorth-east corner, wound round its front, and continued from its\r\nnorth-west corner, on a track still visible, over a brook and through\r\nthe apple-orchard planted by Bishop, to the point where the\r\nburial-ground of the village now is; and so on towards the lands then\r\noccupied by Richard Hutchinson, also to the lands afterwards owned by\r\nNathaniel Ingersol, towards Beaver Dam, and the first settlements in\r\nthat direction and to the westward. In general it may be said, that the\r\nstructural proportions and internal arrangements of the house, taken in\r\nits relations to the vestiges and indications on the face of the\r\ngrounds, show that it is coeval with the first occupancy of the farm.\r\nBut we do not depend, in this case, upon conjectural considerations, or\r\non mere tradition, which, on such a point, is not always reliable. It\r\nhappens to be demonstrated, that this is the veritable house built and\r\noccupied by Townsend Bishop, in 1636, by a singular and irrefragable\r\nchain of specific proof. A protracted land suit, hereafter to be\r\ndescribed, gave rise to a great mass of papers, which are preserved in\r\nthe files of the county courts and the State Department; among them are\r\nseveral plots made by surveyors, and adduced in evidence by the\r\nparties. Not only the locality but a diagram of the house, as then\r\nstanding, are given.[i.72] The spot on which it stood is shown.\r\nFurther, it appears, that in the deeds of transference of the estate,\r\nthe homestead is specially described as the house in which Townsend\r\nBishop lived, called \"Bishop's Mansion.\" This continues to a period\r\nsubsequent to the style of its architecture, and within recent\r\ntradition and the memory of the living. In the old Salem Commoner's\r\nrecords, it is called \"Bishop's Cottage,\" which was the name generally\r\ngiven to dwelling-houses in those early times. Having, as occasion\r\nrequired, been seasonably repaired, it is as strong and good a house\r\nto-day as can be found. Its original timbers, if kept dry and well\r\naired, are beyond decay; and it may stand, a useful, eligible, and\r\ncomely residence, through a future as long as the past. It may be\r\ndoubted whether any dwelling-house now in use in this country can be\r\ncarried back, by any thing like a similar strength of evidence, to an\r\nequal antiquity. Its site, in reference to the surrounding landscape,\r\nwas well chosen. Here its hospitable and distinguished first proprietor\r\nlived, in the interims of his public and official service, in peace and\r\ntranquillity, until ferreted out by the intrusive spirit of an\r\nintolerant age. Here he welcomed his neighbors,—Endicott, Downing,\r\nPeters, John Winthrop, Jr., Read, and other kindred spirits.[A]\r\n\r\n[i.73]\r\n\r\nIn the course of a mysterious providence, this venerable mansion was\r\ndestined to be rendered mem[i.74]orable by its connection with the\r\ndarkest scene in our annals. As that scene cannot otherwise be\r\ncomprehended in all the elements that led to it, it is necessary to\r\ngive the intermediate history of the Townsend Bishop farm and mansion.\r\nIn 1641, Bishop sold it to Henry Chickering, who seems to have been\r\nresiding for some time in Salem, and to whom, in January, 1640, a grant\r\nof land had been made by the town. He continued to own it until the 4th\r\nof October, 1648; although he does not appear to have resided on the\r\nfarm long, as he soon removed to Dedham, from which place he was deputy\r\nto the General Court in 1642, and several years afterwards. He sold the\r\nfarm at the above-mentioned date to Governor Endicott for one hundred\r\nand sixty pounds. In 1653, John Endicott, Jr., the eldest son of the\r\nGovernor, married Elizabeth, daughter of Jeremiah Houchins, an eminent\r\ncitizen of Boston, who had before resided in Hingham, which place he\r\nrepresented as deputy for six years. The name was pronounced \"Houkins,\"\r\nand so perhaps was finally spelled \"Hawkins.\" By agreement, or\r\n\"articles of marriage contract,\" Endicott bestowed the farm upon his\r\nson. \"Present possession\" was given. How long, or how much of the time,\r\nthe young couple lived on the estate, is not known. Their principal\r\nresidence was in Boston. The General Court, in 1660, granted John\r\nEndicott,[i.75] Jr., four hundred acres of land on the eastern side of\r\nthe upper part of Merrimac River. After the purchase of the farm from\r\nChickering, the Endicott property covered nearly a thousand acres in\r\none tract, extending from the arms of the sea to the centre of the\r\npresent village of Tapleyville. On the 10th of May, 1662, the Governor\r\nexecuted a deed, carrying out the engagements of the marriage contract,\r\ngiving to his son John, his heirs, and assigns for ever, the Bishop\r\nfarm. Governor Endicott died in 1665. A will was found signed and\r\nsealed by him, dated May 2, 1659, in which, referring to the marriage\r\ngift to John, he bequeathes the aforesaid farm to \"him and his heirs,\"\r\nbut does not add, \"and assigns.\" Another item of the will is, \"The land\r\nI have bequeathed to my two sons, in one place or another, my will is\r\nthat the longest liver of them shall enjoy the whole, except the Lord\r\nsend them children to inherit it after them.\" Unfortunately, there were\r\nno witnesses to the will. It was not allowed in Probate. The matter was\r\ncarried up to the General Court; and it was decided Aug. 1, 1665, that\r\nthe court \"do not approve of the instrument produced in court to be the\r\nlast will and testament of the late John Endicott, Esq., governor.\" In\r\nOctober of the same year, John Endicott, Jr., petitioned the General\r\nCourt to act on the settlement of his father's estate; and the court\r\ndirects administration to be granted to \"Mrs. Elizabeth Endicott and\r\nher two sons, John and Zerubabel,\" and that they bring in an inventory\r\nto the next county court at Boston, and[i.76] to dispose of the same as\r\nthe law directs. Upon this, the widow of the Governor, and his son\r\nZerubabel, again appeal to the General Court; and on the 23d of May,\r\n1666, \"after a full hearing of all parties concerned in the said\r\nestate, i.e., the said Mrs. Elizabeth Endicott and her two sons, Mr.\r\nJohn and Mr. Zerubabel Endicott, Mr. Jeremiah Houchin being also\r\npresent in court, and respectively presenting their pleas and evidences\r\nin the case,\" it was finally decided and ordered by the court, that the\r\nprovisions of the document purporting to be the will of Governor\r\nEndicott should be carried into effect, with these exceptions: that the\r\nBishop or Chickering farm shall go to his son John \"to him, his heirs\r\nand assigns for ever;\" and that Elizabeth, the wife of said son John,\r\nif she should survive her husband, shall enjoy during her life all the\r\nestate of her husband in all the other houses and lands mentioned in\r\nthe instrument purporting to be his father's will. The court adjudge\r\nthat this must have been \"the real intent of the aforesaid John\r\nEndicott, Esq., deceased, who had during his life special favor and\r\nrespect for her.\" They give the widow of the Governor \"the goods and\r\nchattels\" of the said John Endicott, Esq., her late husband, provided\r\nthat, if \"she shall die seized to the value of more than eighty pounds\r\nsterling\" thereof, the surplus shall be divided between her two sons:\r\nJohn to have a double portion thereof. Finally, they appoint the widow\r\nsole administratrix, and require her to bring in a true inventory to\r\nthe next court for the county of Suffolk, and to pay all debts.[i.77]\r\n\r\nJohn and his father-in-law had it all their own way. The decision of\r\nthe court was perhaps correct, according to legal principles; although\r\nit is not so certain that it was, in all respects, in conformity with\r\nthe intent of Governor Endicott. Undoubtedly, as the language of the\r\ndeed shows, he had made up his mind to give to his son John and \"his\r\nassigns\" absolute, full, and final possession of the Bishop farm. But\r\nit seems equally certain, that he meant to have the rest of his landed\r\nestate, including the Orchard Farm and the Ipswich-river farm, go\r\ndirectly and wholly to the survivor, if either of his sons died without\r\nissue. The facts and dates are as follows: His son John was married in\r\n1653. The Governor's will was made in 1659. It had then become quite\r\nprobable that John might not have issue. The will gives him and his\r\nheirs, but not his assigns, the Bishop farm. In the event of his death\r\nwithout issue, his widow would have her dower and legal life right in\r\nit, but the final heir would be Zerubabel. In 1662, the Governor, who\r\nhad, some years before, removed to Boston, where he resided the\r\nremainder of his life, executed a deed, giving to his son John, \"his\r\nheirs and assigns,\" a full and permanent title to the Bishop farm. This\r\nwas a variation of the plan for the disposition of his estate as shown\r\nin his will. He probably designed to make a new will, securing to his\r\nnatural heirs, so far as his other landed property was concerned, what\r\nhe had thus permitted to pass away from them in the Bishop farm; that\r\nis, the full and immediate possession by[i.78] the survivor, if either\r\nof the sons died without issue. It was a favorite idea, almost a sacred\r\nprinciple, in those days, to have lands go in the natural descent. The\r\nsentiment is quite apparent in the tenor of the Governor's will. When\r\nhe deprived, by his deed to John in 1662, Zerubabel's family of the\r\nright to the final possession of the Bishop farm, it can hardly be\r\ndoubted that he relied upon the provisions of his will to secure to\r\nthem the immediate, complete possession of all his other lands, without\r\nthe incumbrance of any claim of dower or otherwise of John's widow. But\r\nthe pressure of public duties prevented his duly executing his will,\r\nand putting it into a new shape, in conformity with the circumstances\r\nof the case. The troubles that followed teach the necessity of the\r\nutmost caution and carefulness in that most difficult and most\r\nirremediable of all business transactions,—the attempt to continue the\r\ncontrol of property, after death, by written instruments.\r\n\r\nJohn Endicott, Jr., died in February, 1668, without issue; leaving his\r\nwhole estate to his widow, \"her heirs and assigns for ever.\" His will\r\nis dated Jan. 27, 1668, and was offered to Probate on the 29th of\r\nFebruary, 1668. His widow married, Aug. 31, 1668, the Rev. James Allen,\r\none of the ministers of the First Church in Boston, whose previous\r\nwife, Hannah Dummer, by whom he received five hundred acres of land,\r\nhad died in March, 1668. His Endicott wife died April 5, 1673, leaving\r\nthe Townsend-Bishop farm and all her other property to him; and[i.79]\r\non the 11th of September, of the same year, he married Sarah Hawlins.\r\nBy his two preceding wives he received twelve hundred acres of land.\r\nHow much he got by the last-mentioned, we have no information. Besides\r\nthese matrimonial accumulations, the accounts seem to indicate that he\r\nwas rich before.\r\n\r\nIt may well be imagined, that it could not have been very agreeable to\r\nthe family at the Orchard Farm to see this choice and extensive portion\r\nof their estate, which was within full view from their windows, swept\r\ninto the hands of utter strangers in so rapid and extraordinary a\r\nmanner, by a series of circumstances most distasteful and provoking.\r\nBut this was but the beginning of their trouble.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of April, 1678, Allen sold the Bishop farm to Francis\r\nNurse, of the town of Salem, for four hundred pounds. Nurse was an\r\nearly settler, and, before this purchase, had lived, for some forty\r\nyears, \"near Skerry's,\" on the North River, between the main part of\r\nthe settlement in the town of Salem and the ferry to Beverly. He is\r\ndescribed as a \"tray-maker.\" The making of these articles, and similar\r\nobjects of domestic use, was an important employment in a new country\r\nremote from foreign supply. He appears to have been a very respectable\r\nperson, of great stability and energy of character, whose judgment was\r\nmuch relied on by his neighbors. No one is mentioned more frequently as\r\numpire to settle disputes, or arbitrator to adjust conflicting claims.\r\nHe was often on committees to determine boundaries or estimate[i.80]\r\nvaluations, or on local juries to lay out highways and assess damages.\r\nThe fact that he was willing to encounter the difficulties connected\r\nwith such a heavy transaction as the purchase of the Bishop farm at\r\nsuch a price at his time of life proves that he had a spirit equal to a\r\nbold undertaking. He was then fifty-eight years of age. His wife\r\nRebecca was fifty-seven years of age. We shall meet her again.\r\n\r\nThey had four sons,—Samuel, John, Francis, and Benjamin; and four\r\ndaughters,—Rebecca, married to Thomas Preston, Mary to John Tarbell,\r\nElizabeth to William Russell, and Sarah, who remained unmarried until\r\nafter the death of her mother. With this strong force of stalwart sons\r\nand sons-in-law, and their industrious wives, Francis Nurse took hold\r\nof the farm. The terms of the purchase were so judicious and ingenious,\r\nthat they are worthy of being related, and show in what manner\r\nenergetic and able-bodied men, even if not possessed of capital,\r\nparticularly if they could command an effective co-operation in the\r\nlabor of their families, obtained possession of valuable landed\r\nestates. The purchase-money was not required to be paid until the\r\nexpiration of twenty-one years. In the mean time, a moderate annual\r\nrent was fixed upon; seven pounds for each of the first twelve years,\r\nand ten pounds for each of the remaining nine years. If, at the end of\r\nthe time, the amount stipulated had not been paid, or Nurse should\r\nabandon the undertaking, the property was to relapse to Allen.\r\nDisinterested and suitable men, whose appointment was[i.81] provided\r\nfor, were then to estimate the value added to the estate by Nurse\r\nduring his occupancy, by the clearing of meadows or erection of\r\nbuildings or other permanent improvements, and all of that value over\r\nand above one hundred and fifty pounds was to be paid to him. If any\r\npart of the principal sum should be paid prior to the expiration of\r\ntwenty-one years, a proportionate part of the farm was to be relieved\r\nof all obligation to Allen, vest absolutely in Nurse, and be disposable\r\nby him. By these terms, Allen felt authorized to fix a very high price\r\nfor the farm, it not being payable until the lapse of a long period of\r\ntime. If not paid at all, the property would come back to him, with one\r\nhundred and fifty pounds of value added to it. It was not a bad bargain\r\nfor him,—a man of independent means derived from other sources, and so\r\nsituated as not to be able to carry on the farm himself. It was a good\r\ninvestment ahead. To Nurse the terms were most favorable. He did not\r\nhave to pay down a dollar at the start. The low rent required enabled\r\nhim to apply almost the entire income from the farm to improvements\r\nthat would make it more and more productive. Before half the time had\r\nelapsed, a value was created competent to discharge the whole sum due\r\nto Allen. His children severally had good farms within the bounds of\r\nthe estate, were able to assume with ease their respective shares of\r\nthe obligations of the purchase; and the property was thus fully\r\nsecured within the allotted time. Allen gave, at the beginning, a full\r\ndeed, in the ordinary form, which[i.82] was recorded in this county.\r\nNurse gave a duly executed bond, in which the foregoing conditions are\r\ncarefully and clearly defined. That was recorded in Suffolk County; and\r\nnothing, perhaps, was known in the neighborhood, at the time or ever\r\nafter, of the terms of the transaction. When the success of the\r\nenterprise was fully secured, Nurse conveyed to his children the larger\r\nhalf of the farm, reserving the homestead and a convenient amount of\r\nland in his own possession. The plan of this division shows great\r\nfairness and judgment, and was entirely satisfactory to them all. They\r\nwere required, by the deeds he gave them, to maintain a roadway by\r\nwhich they could communicate with each other and with the old parental\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nHere the venerable couple were living in truly patriarchal style,\r\noccupying the \"mansion\" of Townsend Bishop, when the witchcraft\r\ndelusion occurred. They and their children were all clustered within\r\nthe limits of the three-hundred-acre farm. They were one family. The\r\nterritory was their own, secured by their united action, and made\r\ncommodious, productive, valuable, and beautiful to behold, by their\r\nharmonious, patient, and persevering labor. Each family had a\r\nhomestead, and fields and gardens; and children were growing up in\r\nevery household. The elder sons and sons-in-law had become men of\r\ninfluence in the affairs of the church and village. It was a scene of\r\ndomestic happiness and prosperity rarely surpassed. The work of life\r\nhaving been successfully done, it seemed that a peaceful and serene\r\ndescent into the vale of years was[i.83] secured to Francis and Rebecca\r\nNurse. But far otherwise was the allotment of a dark and inscrutable\r\nprovidence.\r\n\r\nThere is some reason to suspect that the prosperity of the Nurses had\r\nawakened envy and jealousy among the neighbors. The very fact that they\r\nwere a community of themselves and by themselves, may have operated\r\nprejudicially. To have a man, who, for forty years, had been known, in\r\nthe immediate vicinity, as a farmer and mechanic on a small scale,\r\nwithout any pecuniary means, get possession of such a property, and\r\nspread out his family to such an extent, was inexplicable to all, and\r\nnot relished perhaps by some. There seems to have been a disposition to\r\npersist in withholding from him the dignity of a landholder; and, long\r\nafter he had distributed his estate among his descendants, it is\r\nmentioned in deeds made by parties that bounded upon it, as \"the farm\r\nwhich Mr. Allen, of Boston, lets to the Nurses.\" Not knowing probably\r\nany thing about it, they call it, even after Nurse's death, \"Mr.\r\nAllen's farm.\" This, however, was a slight matter. When Allen sold the\r\nfarm to Nurse, he bound himself to defend the title; and he was true to\r\nhis bond. What was required to be done in this direction may, perhaps,\r\nhave exposed the Nurses to animosities which afterwards took terrible\r\neffect against them.\r\n\r\nIn granting lands originally, neither the General Court nor the town\r\nexercised sufficient care to define boundaries. There does not appear\r\nto have been any well-arranged system, based upon elaborate,\r\naccurate,[i.84] scientific surveys. Of the dimensions of the area of a\r\nrough, thickly wooded, unfrequented country, the best estimates of the\r\nmost practised eyes, and measurements resting on mere exploration or\r\nperambulation, are very unreliable. The consequence was, that, in many\r\ncases, grants were found to overlap each other. This was the case with\r\nthe Bishop farm; and soon after Nurse came into possession, and had\r\nbegun to operate upon it, a conflict commenced; trespasses were\r\ncomplained of; suits were instituted; and one of the most memorable and\r\nobstinately contested land-controversies known to our courts took\r\nplace. In that controversy Nurse was not formally a principal. The case\r\nwas between James Allen and Zerubabel Endicott, or between Allen and\r\nNathaniel Putnam.\r\n\r\nAn inspection of the map, at this point, will enable us to understand\r\nthe grounds on which the suit was contested. The Orchard Farm was\r\ngranted to Endicott, as has been stated, July 3, 1632, by the General\r\nCourt. The grant states the bounds on the south and on the north to be\r\ntwo rivers; on the east, another river, into which they both flow; and,\r\non the west, the mainland. Where this western line was to strike the\r\nrivers on the north and south is not specified; but the natural\r\ninterpretation would seem to be, in the absence of any thing to the\r\ncontrary, that it was to strike them at their respective heads. The\r\nevidence of all persons who were conversant with the premises during\r\nthe life of the Governor as connected with the farm was unanimous and\r\nconclusive to[i.85] this point; that is, that he and they always\r\nsupposed that the west line was, as drawn on the map, from the head of\r\none river to the head of the other; that the farm embraced all between\r\nthem as far up as the tide set. It was objected, on the other side,\r\nthat this made the farm much more than three hundred acres; but as an\r\noffset to that was the fact, that a considerable part of the area was\r\nswamp or marsh, not usually taken into the account in reckoning the\r\nextent of a grant, and the additional fact, that the language of the\r\nGeneral Court in reference to quantity was not precise,—\"about\" three\r\nhundred acres. At the same date with the grant to Endicott, the General\r\nCourt granted two hundred acres to Mr. Skelton, which tract is given on\r\nthe map.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated, the General Court conferred upon the towns the\r\nexclusive right to dispose of the lands within their limits, March 3,\r\n1635. On the 10th of December of that year, the town of Salem granted\r\nto Robert Cole the tract of three hundred acres subsequently purchased\r\nby Emanuel Downing, which is indicated on the map. On the 11th of\r\nJanuary, 1636, the grant of three hundred acres was made to Townsend\r\nBishop. Its language is unfortunately obscure in some expressions; but\r\nit is clear, that the tract was to be four hundred rods in length, one\r\nhundred and twenty-four rods in width at the western end, and one\r\nhundred and sixteen rods at the eastern. At the north-east corner it\r\nwas to meet the water or brook that separated it from the grant to\r\nSkelton; and it[i.86] was also to \"but\" upon, or touch, at the eastern\r\nend, the land granted to Endicott by the General Court. After the grant\r\nto Bishop, the town, from time to time, made grants to Stileman of land\r\nnorth of the Bishop grant. Stileman's grants adjoined Skelton's at the\r\nnorth-eastern corner of the Bishop farm. That part of Stileman's land\r\nhad come into possession of Nathaniel Putnam, and the residue\r\nwestwardly, together with the grant to Weston, into the possession of\r\nHutchinson, Houlton, and Ingersol. Still further west, the town had\r\nmade grants to Swinnerton. Their respective locations are given in the\r\nmap. The point of difficulty which gave rise to litigation was this:\r\nThe Bishop farm was required, by the terms of the grant, to be one\r\nhundred and sixteen rods wide at its eastern end. But there was no room\r\nfor it. The requisite width could not be got without encroaching upon\r\neither Putnam or Endicott, or both. As Endicott stood upon an earlier\r\ntitle than that of Bishop, and from a higher authority, and Putnam upon\r\na later title from an inferior authority, the court of trials might\r\nhave disposed of the matter, at the opening, on that ground, and Putnam\r\nbeen left to suffer the encroachment. But it did not so decide; and the\r\ncase went on. The struggle was between Endicott to push it north, and\r\nthereby save his Orchard Farm, and the land between it and the Bishop\r\ngrant, given by the town to his father, called the Governor's Plain,\r\nand Nathaniel Putnam to push it south, and thereby save the land he had\r\nreceived from his wife's father, Rich[i.87]ard Hutchinson, who had\r\npurchased from Stileman. Allen stood on the defensive against both of\r\nthem. The Nurses had nothing to do but to attend to their own business,\r\ncarrying on their farming operations up to the limits of their deed,\r\nlooking to Allen for redress, if, in the end, the dimensions of their\r\nestate should be curtailed. But, being the occupants, and, until\r\nfinally ousted, the owners of the land, if there was any intrusion to\r\nbe repelled, or violence to be met, or fighting to be done, they were\r\nthe ones to do it. They were equal to the situation.\r\n\r\nAfter various trials in the courts of law in all possible shapes, the\r\nwhole subject was carried up to the General Court, where it was\r\ndecided, in conformity with the report of a special commission in May,\r\n1679, substantially in favor of Putnam and Allen. Endicott petitioned\r\nfor a new hearing. Another commission was appointed; and their report\r\nwas accepted in May, 1682. It was more unfavorable to Endicott than the\r\nprevious one. He protested against the judgment of the court in earnest\r\nbut respectful language, and petitioned for still another hearing. They\r\nagain complied with his request, and appointed a day for once more\r\nexamining the case; but, when the day came, Nov. 24, 1683, he was sick\r\nin bed, and the case was settled irrevocably against him.\r\n\r\nThe map gives the lines of the Bishop farm as finally settled by the\r\nGeneral Court. It will be noticed, that it is laid directly across the\r\nGovernor's Plain, and runs far into the Orchard Farm \"up to the\r\nrocks[i.88] near Endicott's dwelling-house,\" or, as it is otherwise\r\nstated, \"within a few rods of Guppy's ditch, near to\" the said house.\r\nIt may be said to have been a necessity, as the original three hundred\r\nacres of the grant to Townsend Bishop had to be made up. It could not\r\ngo north; for Houlton and Ingersol stood upon the Weston grant, and\r\nHutchinson and Nathaniel Putnam stood upon Stileman's grants, to push\r\nit back. It could not go west or south-west, for there Swinnerton stood\r\nto fend off upon his grants; and there, too, was Nathaniel Putnam, upon\r\nhis own grant, and lands he had purchased of another original grantee.\r\nIt could not be swung round to the south without jamming up the lands\r\nof Felton and others, or pushing them over the grants, made to Robert\r\nCole—under which Downing had purchased—and to Thomas Read. All these\r\nparties were combined to force it south-eastwardly over the grounds of\r\nEndicott. Nathaniel Putnam was his most fatal antagonist. He was a man\r\nof remarkable energy, of consummate adroitness, and untiring resources\r\nin such a transaction; and he so managed to press in the bounds of the\r\nBishop farm, at the north-east, as to gain a valuable strip for\r\nhimself. With this strong man against him, acting in combination with\r\nthe rich and influential James Allen, minister of the great\r\nmetropolitan First Church, and licenser of the press, who brought the\r\nwhole power of his clerical and social connections in Boston and\r\nthroughout the colony to bear upon the General Court, Zerubabel\r\nEndicott had no chance for justice, and no redress for[i.89] wrong. In\r\nvain he invoked the memory of his father, or of Winthrop, the\r\ngrandfather of his wife. His father and both the Winthrops had long\r\nbefore left the scene: a new generation had risen, and there was none\r\nto help him.\r\n\r\nOne would have supposed, that the General Court, which had granted the\r\nOrchard Farm to Governor Endicott, would have felt bound, in\r\nself-respect and in honor, to have protected it against any overlapping\r\ngrants subsequently made by an inferior authority. Under the\r\ncircumstances of the case, it was its duty to have held the Orchard\r\nFarm intact, and made it up to the satisfaction of Allen and Nurse by a\r\ngrant elsewhere, or an equitable compensation in money. It owed so much\r\nto the son of Endicott and the grand-daughter of Winthrop, the first\r\nnoble Fathers of the colony. Perhaps the court found its justification\r\nin the phraseology of the deed of conveyance of the Bishop farm from\r\nGovernor Endicott to his son John. After reciting or referring to the\r\noriginal town grant to Bishop, and the deeds from Bishop to Chickering,\r\nand from Chickering to himself, the Governor conveys to his son John\r\nall the houses, &c., and every part and parcel of the land \"to the\r\nutmost extent thereof, according as is expressed or included in either\r\nof the forecited deeds, or town grant.\" It was maintained, and justly,\r\nby Allen, that he held all that was conveyed to John Endicott, Jr. But\r\nthe Court had no right to encroach upon the Orchard Farm, which\r\nhad[i.90] been granted to the Governor by them prior to all deeds and\r\nto the town grant to Bishop.\r\n\r\nNever did that deep and sagacious observation on the mysteries of human\r\nnature, \"Men's judgments are a parcel of their fortunes,\" receive a\r\nmore striking or melancholy illustration than in the case of Zerubabel\r\nEndicott. With his falling fortunes, his judgment and discretion fell\r\nalso; his mind, maddened by a sense of wrong, seemed bent upon exposing\r\nitself to new wrongs. Having been broken down by lawsuits, that had\r\nwasted his estate, he seemed to have acquired a blind passion for them.\r\nHaving destroyed his peace and embarrassed his affairs in attempts to\r\nresist the adjudications of the Court, he persisted in struggling\r\nagainst them. He had tried to push the Bishop grant west, over the land\r\nof Nathaniel Putnam in that quarter. The highest tribunal had settled\r\nit against him. But he appeared to be incapable of realizing the fact.\r\nHe sent his hired men to cut timber on that land. They worked there\r\nsome days, felled a large number of trees, and hewed them into beams\r\nand joists for the frame of a house. One morning, returning to their\r\nwork, there was no timber to be found; logs, framework, and all, were\r\ngone. They were carefully piled up a mile away, by the side of Putnam's\r\ndwelling-house, who had sent two teams, one of four oxen, the other of\r\ntwo oxen and a horse, with an adequate force of men, and in two\r\nloadings had cleaned out the whole. Endicott of course sued him, and of\r\ncourse was cast.\r\n\r\nWhen the General Court had consented to give him[i.91] a rehearing of\r\nthe case of the Bishop farm, they expressly forbade his making any\r\n\"strip\" of the land in the mean while. But with the infatuation which\r\nseemed to possess him, and not heeding how fatally it would prejudice\r\nhis cause at the impending hearing to violate the order of the Court,\r\nhe again sent a gang of men to cut wood on the land in controversy. The\r\nfollowing shows the result:—\r\n\r\n\"Hugh Jones, aged 46 years, and Alexius Reinolds, aged 25 years,\r\ntestify and say, that we, these deponents, being desired by Mr.\r\nZerubabel Endicott to cut up some wood, for his winter firewood,\r\naccordingly went with our teams, which had four oxen and a horse; and\r\nthere we met with several other teams of our neighbors, which were upon\r\nthe same account, that is to say, to help carry up Mr. Endicott some\r\nwood for his winter firewood, and when we had loaded our sleds, Thomas\r\nPreston and John Tarbell came in a violent manner, and hauled the wood\r\nout of our sleds; and Francis Nurse, being present, demanded whose men\r\nwe were. Mr. Endicott, being present, answered, they were his men.\"\r\n\r\nThese witnesses testify that this \"battle of the wilderness\" lasted two\r\ndays,—Endicott's men cutting the wood and loading the teams, and\r\nNurse's men pitching it off. The altercations and conflicts that took\r\nplace between the parties during those two days may easily be imagined.\r\nWhether there was a final, decisive pitched battle, we are not\r\ninformed. Perhaps there was. The woods rang with rough echoes, we may\r\nbe well assured. A lawsuit followed; the result could not be in doubt.\r\nEndicott had no right there;[i.92] he was there in direct violation of\r\nthe order of Court. Nurse was in possession, had a right, and was\r\nbound, to keep the land from being stripped.\r\n\r\nShortly after this, Endicott broke down, under the difficulties that\r\nhad accumulated around him. On the 24th of November, 1683, as we have\r\nseen, he was \"sick in bed.\" Two days before,—that is, on the 22d of\r\nNovember,—he had made his will, which was presented in court on the\r\n27th of March, 1684. He was game to the last; for this is an item of\r\nthe will:—\r\n\r\n\"Whereas my late father, by his last will, bequeathed to me his farm\r\ncalled Bishop's or Chickering's farm, I do give the said farm to my\r\nfive sons, to be equally divided among them.\"\r\n\r\nThe will of his father had been declared invalid on that point, and\r\nothers. The whole thing had been conclusively settled for years; but he\r\nnever would recognize the fact. It is a singular instance of an\r\nobstinacy of will completely superseding and suppressing the reason and\r\nthe judgment. He lost the perception of the actual and real, in\r\nclinging to what he felt to be the right.\r\n\r\nEvery association and sentiment of his soul had been shocked by the\r\nwrongs he had suffered. He could not walk over his fields, or look from\r\nhis windows, without feeling that a property which his father had given\r\nto his brother had, in a manner that he knew would have been as odious\r\nto that father as it was to him, passed into the hands of strangers,\r\nand been used as a wedge on which everybody had conspired to deal\r\nblows,[i.93] driving it into the centre of his patrimonial acres,\r\nsplitting and rending them through and through. He brooded over the\r\nthought, until, whenever his mind was turned to it, his reason was\r\ndethroned, his heart broken, and under its weight he fell into his\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nAn argument addressed by him to the court and jury, in one of the\r\ninnumerable trials of the Bishop-farm case, is among the papers on\r\nfile. It appears to be a verbatim report of the speech as it was\r\ndelivered at the time, and proves him to have been a man of talents. It\r\nis courteous, gentlemanly, and, I might say, scholarly in its diction\r\nand style, skilful in its statements, and forcible in its arguments.\r\n\r\nIn all the earlier trials, the juries uniformly gave verdicts in favor\r\nof Endicott; but Allen carried the cases up to the General Court, which\r\nexercised a final and unrestrained jurisdiction in all matters referred\r\nto it. It usually appointed committees or commissioners to examine such\r\nquestions, accepted their reports, and made them binding. Lands were\r\nthus disposed of without the agency, and against the decisions, of\r\njuries. In his arguments addressed to the General Court, Zerubabel\r\nEndicott protested against this jurisdiction, by which his lands were\r\ntaken from him \"by a committee, in an arbitrary way, being neither\r\nbound nor sworn by law or evidence.\" He boldly denounced it.\r\n\r\n\"To be disseized of my inheritance; to be judged by three or four\r\ncommittee-men, who are neither bound to law nor evidence,—who are, or\r\nmay be, mutable in their apprehensions,[i.94] doing one thing to-day,\r\nand soon again undoing what they did,—I conceive, to be judged in such\r\nan arbitrary way is repugnant to the fundamental law of England\r\ncontained in Magna Charta, chap. 29, which says no freeman shall be\r\ndisseized of his freehold but by the lawful judgment of his peers,—that\r\nis to say, by due process of law; which was also confirmed by the\r\nPetition of Right, by Act of Parliament, _tertio Caroli I_. And also\r\nsuch arbitrary jurisdiction was exploded in putting down the\r\nStar-Chamber Court; and the excessive fines imposed upon all such\r\nactings. See 'English Liberties,' as also the fourth and sixth articles\r\nagainst the Earl of Strafford in Baker's 'Chronicle,' folio 518.\"\r\n\r\nHe closes one of his remonstrances thus:—\r\n\r\n\"The humble request of your petitioner to the Hon. Gen. Court, that, as\r\nan Englishman,—as a freeman of this jurisdiction; as descended from him\r\nwho, in his time, sought the welfare of this commonwealth,—I may have\r\nthe benefit and protection of the wholesome laws established in this\r\njurisdiction: that, in my extreme wrong, I may have liberty to seek\r\nrelief in a way of law, and may not, contrary to Magna Charta, be\r\ndisseized of my freehold by the arbitrary act of two or three\r\ncommittee-men; the fundamental law of England knowing no such\r\nconstitution, abhorring such administrations: and that the Hon. Court\r\nwould release your petitioner from the injurious effects of the said\r\ncommittee's act, and explode so pernicious a precedent.\"\r\n\r\nZerubabel Endicott was an imprudent and obstinate man, but had the\r\ntraits of a generous, ardent, and noble character. He was a physician\r\nby profession. His second wife—the widow, as has been stated, of Rev.\r\nAntipas Newman, of Wenham, and daughter of[i.95] John Winthrop, Jr.,\r\ngovernor of Connecticut—survived him. Although he left five sons, the\r\nname, at one time, was borne by a single descendant only, a lad of\r\nseven years of age,—Samuel, a grandson of Zerubabel. On him it hung\r\nsuspended, but he saved it. From that boy, those who bear the name in\r\nNew England have been derived. We rejoice to believe that they will\r\npreserve it, and keep its honor bright.\r\n\r\nWinthrop was recognized as the great leader in the early history of the\r\nColony. He had a combination of qualities that marked him as a wise and\r\ngood man, and gave him precedence. The eminent dignity of his character\r\nwas admired and revered by all. No one was more ready to admit this\r\nthan Endicott. Never were men placed towards each other in relations\r\nmore severely testing their magnanimity, and none ever bore the test\r\nmore perfectly. But Endicott was, after all, the most complete\r\nrepresentative man of that generation. He was thoroughly identified\r\nwith the people, participating in their virtues and in their defects.\r\nHe was a strict religionist, a sturdy Puritan, a firm administrator of\r\nthe law; at the same time, there are indications that he was of a\r\ngenial spirit. He was personally brave, and officially intrepid. His\r\nadministration of the government required nerve, and he had it.\r\nSometimes the ardor of his temperament put him for a moment off his\r\nguard; but he was quick to acknowledge his error. He was true to the\r\npeople, who never faltered in their fidelity to him. The author of\r\n\"Wonder-working Providence\" de[i.96]scribed him as \"a fit instrument to\r\nbegin the wilderness worke, of courage bold undaunted, yet sociable and\r\nof a cheerful spirit.\" I have presented some instances of his kind and\r\npleasant relations with his workmen and neighbors. His name will ever\r\nbe held in honored remembrance in this vicinity, where his useful\r\nenterprise was appreciated; and his descendants in our day, and to the\r\npresent time, have contributed to the prosperity and the adornment of\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\nIt is not unlikely, that hostile feelings towards the Nurses, which\r\ncontributed afterwards to serious results, may have been engendered in\r\nthis long-continued land quarrel. There is evidence that no such\r\nfeeling existed on the part of the Endicotts: but there were many\r\nothers interested; for, by testimony at the trials and in outside\r\ndiscussions, the whole community had become more or less implicated in\r\nthe strife. The Nurses, as holding the ground and having to bear the\r\nbrunt of defending it in all cases of intrusion, had a difficult\r\nposition, and may have made some enemies. At any rate, this controversy\r\nwas one of the means of stirring up animosities in the neighborhood;\r\nand an account of it has been deemed necessary, as contributing to\r\nindicate the elements of the awful convulsions which soon afterwards\r\ndesolated Salem Village.\r\n\r\nWhen we reach the story, for which this account of the farms of the\r\nvillage and the population that grew up on them is a preparative, we\r\nshall come back to the Townsend-Bishop grant, and to the house, still\r\nstanding, that he built and dwelt in, upon it. It may be[i.97] well to\r\npause, and view its interesting history prior to 1692. While occupied\r\nby its original owner, the \"mansion,\" or \"cottage,\" was the scene of\r\nsocial intercourse among the choicest spirits of the earliest age of\r\nNew England. Here Bishop, and, after him, Chickering, entertained their\r\nfriends. Here the fine family of Richard Ingersoll was brought up. Here\r\nGovernor Endicott projected plans for opening the country; and the road\r\nthat passes its entrance-gate was laid out by him. To this same house,\r\nyoung John Endicott brought his youthful Boston bride. Here she came\r\nagain, fifteen years afterwards, as the bride of the learned and\r\ndistinguished James Allen, to show him the farm which, received as a\r\n\"marriage gift\" from her former husband, she had brought as a \"marriage\r\ngift\" to him. Here the same Allen, in less than six years afterwards,\r\nbrought still another bride. In all these various, and some of them\r\nrather rapid, changes, it was, no doubt, often the resort of\r\ndistinguished guests, and the place of meeting of many pleasant\r\ncompanies. During the protracted years of litigation for its\r\npossession, frequent consultations were held within it; and now, for\r\ntwelve years, it had been the home of a happy, harmonious, and\r\nprosperous family, exemplifying the industry, energy, and enterprise of\r\na New England household. A new chapter was destined, as we shall see,\r\nto be opened in its singular and diversified history. But we must\r\nreturn to the enumeration of the original landholders of the\r\nvillage.[i.98]\r\n\r\nGeorge Corwin came to Salem in 1638. He had large tracts of land in\r\nvarious places. He lived, a part of his time, on his farm in the\r\nvillage; is found to have taken an active part in the proceedings of\r\nthe people, particularly in military affairs; and was captain of a\r\ncompany of cavalry. His great mercantile transactions probably led him\r\nto have his residence mostly in the town, first on a lot on Washington\r\nStreet, near the corner of Norman Street, where his grandson the\r\nsheriff lived in 1692. In 1660, he bought of Ann, the relict of\r\nNicholas Woodbury, a lot on Essex Street, next east of the Browne\r\nBlock, with a front of about one hundred and fifty feet. Here he built\r\na fine mansion, in which he lived the remainder of his days. He died\r\nJan. 6, 1685, leaving an estate inventoried at £5,964. 10_s._ 7_d._,—a\r\nlarge fortune for those times. His portrait is preserved by his\r\ndescendants, one of whom, the late George A. Ward, describes his dress\r\nas represented in the picture: \"A wrought flowing neckcloth, a sash\r\ncovered with lace, a coat with short cuffs and reaching half-way\r\nbetween the wrist and elbow; the skirts in plaits below; an octagon\r\nring and cane.\" The last two articles are still preserved. His\r\ninventory mentions \"a silver-laced cloth coat, a velvet ditto, a satin\r\nwaistcoat embroidered with gold, a trooping scarf and silver hat-band,\r\ngolden-topped and embroidered, and a silver-headed cane.\" His farms in\r\nthe vicinity contained fifteen hundred acres. His connections were\r\ndistinguished, and his descendants have included many eminent persons.\r\nThe name, by male[i.99] descent, disappeared for a time in this part of\r\nthe country; but in the last generation it was restored in the female\r\ndescent by an act of the Legislature, and is honorably borne by one of\r\nour most respectable families, who inherit his blood, and cherish the\r\nmemorials which time has spared of their first American ancestor.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hathorne appears on the church records as early as 1636. He\r\ndied in June, 1681, seventy-four years of age. No one in our annals\r\nfills a larger space. As soldier commanding important and difficult\r\nexpeditions, as counsel in cases before the courts, as judge on the\r\nbench, and in innumerable other positions requiring talent and\r\nintelligence, he was constantly called to serve the public. He was\r\ndistinguished as a public speaker, and is the only person, I believe,\r\nof that period, whose reputation as an orator has come down to us. He\r\nwas an Assistant, that is, in the upper branch of the Legislature,\r\nseventeen years. He was a deputy twenty years. When the deputies, who\r\nbefore sat with the assistants, were separated into a distinct body,\r\nand the House of Representatives thus came into existence, in 1644,\r\nHathorne was their first Speaker. He occupied the chair, with\r\nintermediate services on the floor from time to time, until raised to\r\nthe other House. He was an inhabitant of Salem Village, having his farm\r\nthere, and a dwelling-house, in which he resided when his legislative,\r\nmilitary, and other official duties permitted. His son John, who\r\nsucceeded him in all his public honors, also lived on his own farm in\r\nthe village[i.100] a great part of the time. The name is indelibly\r\nstamped on the hills and meadows of the region, as it was in the civil\r\nhistory of that age, and has been in the elegant literature of the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nWilliam Trask was one of what are called the \"First Planters.\" He came\r\nover before Endicott, had his residence on Salem Farms, was a most\r\nenergetic, enterprising, and useful citizen, and filled a great variety\r\nof public stations. He brought large tracts of land under culture,\r\nplanted orchards, and established mills at the head of tide-water on\r\nthe North River. He was the military leader of the first age of the\r\nplantations in this neighborhood, was captain of the train-band from\r\nthe beginning, and, by his gallantry and energy in action, commanded\r\nthe applause of his contemporaries. For his services in the Pequot\r\nExpedition, the General Court gave him and his associates large grants\r\nof land. His obsequies were celebrated, on the 16th of May, 1666, with\r\ngreat military parade; and the people of the town and the whole\r\nsurrounding country followed his honored remains to the grave.\r\n\r\nRichard Davenport came to Salem in 1631. His first residence was in the\r\ntown; but soon he was led to the Farms. In 1636, he received a grant of\r\neighty acres; in 1638, of two hundred and twenty acres; and, in 1642,\r\neighty acres more, to be divided between him and Captain Lothrop.\r\nBesides these, he received several smaller grants of meadow and salt\r\nmarsh. Such grants were made only with the view of having[i.101] them\r\nduly improved; and it cannot be doubted that he was zealously engaged\r\nin agricultural operations. His town residence was on a lot reaching\r\nfrom Essex Street to the North River. Its front extended from the\r\ngrounds now the site of the North Church to North Street. His house\r\nstood at some distance back from Essex Street. This estate was sold by\r\nhis administrators, in 1674, to Jonathan Corwin, whose family occupied\r\nit until a very recent period. He left the town in 1643, and\r\nsubsequently lived in what was afterwards Salem Village, until the\r\npublic service called him away. He sold some of his estates, but\r\nretained others, on the Farms and in the town, to the time of his\r\ndeath. He continued the superintendence of his country estate, which\r\nseems to have been his family home, to the last. His military career\r\ngave him early distinction, and closed only with his life. In 1634, the\r\nGeneral Court chose him \"Ensign to Capt. Trask.\" He was concerned with\r\nEndicott in cutting out the cross from the king's colors. The following\r\nis from the record of a meeting of the court, Nov. 7, 1634: \"It is\r\nordered that Ensign Davenport shall be sent for by warrant, with\r\ncommand to bring his colors with him to the next court, as also any\r\nother that hath defaced the said colors.\" Davenport did not seem\r\nanxious to cover up his agency in this matter; for, when he offered his\r\nnext child to baptism, he signified to the assembly that he was\r\ndetermined to commemorate and perpetuate the memory of the transaction,\r\nby having her christened \"True[i.102] Cross.\" It was necessary to make\r\na show of punishing Endicott and Davenport on this occasion, to prevent\r\ntrouble from the home government. Soon after, we find the General Court\r\nheaping honors upon Davenport, and finally, in 1639, making him a grant\r\nof one hundred and fifty acres of land, specially noticing his services\r\nin the Pequot War, which appear to have elicited general applause. In\r\nsome desperate encounters with the savages, seventeen arrows were shot\r\n\"into his coat of mail,\" and he was wounded in unprotected parts of his\r\nperson. He was twice deputy to the General Court. In 1644, the General\r\nCourt organized an elaborate system of external defence, the whole\r\nbased upon Castle Island, now Fort Independence, in Boston Harbor. From\r\nthat point, hostile invasion by a naval force was to be repelled. Every\r\nvessel, on entering, was to report to the castle, be examined and\r\nsubject to the orders of the commandant. It became the military\r\nheadquarters of the colony, the protection and oversight of whose\r\ncommerce were intrusted to the officer in command. This was the highest\r\nmilitary station and trust in the gift of the Government. It was\r\nassigned to Richard Davenport; and he held it for twenty-one years, to\r\nthe moment of his death. The country reposed in confidence upon his\r\nwatchful fidelity. He put and kept the castle in an efficient\r\ncondition. In 1659, as evidence of their satisfaction and approval of\r\nhis official conduct, the General Court made him a grant of five\r\nhundred acres of land laid out in Lancaster. On the 15th of July, 1665,\r\nhe was killed by[i.103] lightning, at his post. The records of the\r\nGeneral Court speak of \"the solemn stroke of thunder that took away\r\nCaptain Davenport.\" The whole country mourned the loss of the veteran\r\nsoldier; and the Court granted his family an additional tract of one\r\nhundred acres of land on the Merrimac River. He was in his sixtieth\r\nyear at the time of his death. Of the company required to be raised in\r\nSalem for the Block-Island Expedition, in 1636, the three commissioned\r\nofficers were furnished from the Farms,—Trask, Davenport, and Read.\r\nThey were soldiers by nature and instinct, and to the end. The volleys\r\nof devoted, faithful, and mourning comrades were fired over their\r\ngraves, with no great interval of time. United in early service,\r\nseparated by the course of their lives, they were united again in\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThomas Lothrop originally lived in the town, between Collins Cove and\r\nthe North River. He became a member of the First Church in Salem, and\r\nwas admitted a freeman in 1634. He soon removed to the Farms; and his\r\nname appears among the rate-payers at the formation of the village\r\nparish. For many years he was deputy from Salem to the General Court;\r\nand after Beverly was set off, as his residence at the time was on that\r\nside of the line, he was always in the General Court, as deputy from\r\nthe new town, when his other public employments permitted. No man was\r\never more identified with the history of the Salem Farms. He\r\ncontributed to form the structure of its society, and the character of\r\nits population, by all that[i.104] a wise and good man could do. During\r\nhis whole life in America, he was more or less engaged in the military\r\nservice, in arduous, difficult, and dangerous positions and operations;\r\nacting sometimes against Indians, and sometimes against the French, or,\r\nas was usually the case, against them both combined. He was\r\noccasionally sent to distant posts; commanding expeditions to the\r\neastward as far as Acadia. He was at one time in charge of a force at\r\nPort Royal, now Annapolis, Nova Scotia. Increase Mather calls him a\r\n\"godly and courageous commander.\" When the last decisive struggle with\r\nKing Philip was approaching, and aid was needed from the eastern part\r\nof the colony to rescue the settlements on the Connecticut River from\r\nutter destruction, the \"Flower of Essex\" was summoned to the field. It\r\nwas a choice body of efficient men, \"all culled out of the towns\r\nbelonging to this county,\" numbering about one hundred men. Lothrop, of\r\ncourse, was their captain. In August, 1675, they were on the ground at\r\nHadley, the place of rendezvous. On the 26th of that month, Captain\r\nLothrop, with his company, and Captain Beers, of Watertown, with his,\r\nafter a vigorous pursuit, attacked the Indians in a swamp, about ten\r\nmiles from Hatfield, at the foot of Sugar-Loaf Hill. Ten were killed on\r\nthe side of the English, and twenty-six on the side of the Indians, who\r\nwere driven from the swamp, and scattered in their flight; to fall, as\r\nwas their custom, upon detached settlements; and continuing to waste\r\nand destroy, by fire and sword, with[i.105] hatchet, scalping-knife,\r\ntorch, and gun. On the 18th of September, Lothrop, with his company,\r\nstarted from Deerfield, to convoy a train of eighteen wagons, loaded\r\nwith grain, and furniture of the inhabitants seeking refuge from\r\ndanger, with teamsters and others. Moseley, with his men, remained\r\nbehind, to scout the woods, and give notice of the approach of Indians;\r\nbut the stealthy savages succeeded in effecting a complete surprise,\r\nand fell upon Lothrop as his wagons were crossing a stream. They poured\r\nin a destructive fire from the woods, in all directions. They were\r\nseven to one. A perfect carnage ensued. Lothrop fell early in the\r\nunequal fight, and only seven or eight of his whole party were left to\r\ntell the story of the fatal scene. The locality of this disastrous and\r\nsanguinary tragedy has ever since been known as \"Bloody Brook.\" In the\r\nlist of those who perished by bullet, tomahawk, or arrow, on that\r\nfearful morning, we read the names of many village neighbors of the\r\nbrave and lamented commander,—Thomas Bayley, Edward Trask, Josiah\r\nDodge, Peter Woodbury, Joseph Balch, Thomas Buckley, Joseph King,\r\nRobert Wilson, and James Tufts. One of Lothrop's sergeants, who was\r\namong the slain, Thomas Smith, then of Newbury, originated in the\r\nvillage. His family had grants of land, including the hill called by\r\ntheir name.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lothrop was as remarkable for the benevolence of his spirit and\r\nthe tenderness of his nature as for his wisdom in council, energy in\r\ncommand, or gallantry in battle. Indeed, his character in private\r\nlife[i.106] was so beautiful and lovable, that I cannot refrain from\r\nleading you into the recesses of his domestic circle. It presents a\r\npicture of rare attractiveness. He had no children. His wife was a kind\r\nand amiable person. They longed for objects upon which to gratify the\r\nyearnings of their affectionate hearts. He had a large estate. His\r\ncharacter became known to the neighbors and the country people around.\r\nIf there was an occurrence calling for commiseration anywhere in the\r\nvicinity, it was managed to bring it to his notice. Orphan children\r\nwere received into his household, and brought up with parental care and\r\ntenderness. Many were, in this way, the objects of his charity and\r\naffections. Persons especially, who were in any degree connected with\r\nhis wife's family, naturally conceived the desire to have him adopt\r\ntheir children. This was the case particularly with those who were in\r\nstraitened circumstances. Others, knowing his disposition, would bring\r\ntales of distress and destitution to his ears. Some, perhaps, turned\r\nout to be unworthy of his goodness. In one instance, at least, where he\r\nhad taken a child into his family in its infancy, touched by appeals\r\nmade to his compassion by the parents, brought it up carefully, watched\r\nover its education, and become attached to it, when it had reached an\r\nage to be serviceable, the parents claimed and insisted on their right\r\nto it, and took it away, much against his will. But the good man's\r\nbenevolence was not impaired, nor the stream of his affectionate\r\ncharities checked, by the misconduct[i.107] or ingratitude of his wards\r\nor of their friends. His plan was to do all the good in his power to\r\nthe children thus brought into his family, to prepare them for\r\nusefulness, and start them favorably in life. In the case of boys, he\r\nwould get them apprenticed to worthy people in useful callings. At the\r\ntime of his death, there were two grown-up members of his family, who\r\nappear to have been foisted upon his care in their earliest childhood.\r\nBut there was no blame to be attached to them in the premises; and they\r\nwere regarded by him with much affection. There were no relations of\r\nhis own in this country in need of charitable aid or without adequate\r\nparental protection; and it was not strange that several of his wife's\r\nconnections should have availed themselves of the benefit of his\r\ngenerous disposition. She herself gives a very interesting account of\r\nan instance of this sort, in a deposition found wrapped up among some\r\nold papers in the county court-house. The object of the statement was\r\nto explain how a connection of hers became domesticated in the family.\r\n\r\n\"When the child's mother was dead, my husband being with me at my\r\ncousin's burial, and seeing our friends in so sad a condition, the poor\r\nbabe having lost its mother, and the woman that nursed it being fallen\r\nsick, I then did say to some of my friends, that, if my husband would\r\ngive me leave, I could be very willing to take my cousin's little one\r\nfor a while, till he could better dispose of it; whereupon the child's\r\nfather did move it to my husband. My dear husband, considering my\r\nweakness, and the incumbrance I had in the family,[i.108] was pleased\r\nto return this answer,—that he did not see how it was possible for his\r\nwife to undergo such a burden. The next day there came a friend to our\r\nhouse, a woman which gave suck, and she understanding how the poor babe\r\nwas left, being intreated, was willing to take it to nurse, and\r\nforthwith it was brought to her: but it had not been with her three\r\nweeks before it pleased the Lord to visit that nurse with sickness\r\nalso; and the nurse's mother came to me desiring I would take the child\r\nfrom her daughter, and then my dear husband, observing the providence\r\nof God, was freely willing to receive her into his house.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time when this addition was made to his family, there was\r\ncertainly already in it another of his wife's connections, who had been\r\nbrought there when an infant in a manner perhaps equally singular, and\r\nwho had grown up to maturity. The particular \"incumbrance,\" however,\r\nspoken of by her, related to another matter. She was an only daughter.\r\nHer father had died many years before, at quite an advanced age. Her\r\nmother, who was sickly and infirm as well as aged, was taken\r\nimmediately into her family, and remained under her roof until her\r\ndeath. In her weak and helpless condition, much care and exertion were\r\nthrown upon her daughter. The only objection the captain seemed to have\r\nto increasing the burden of the household, by receiving into it this\r\nadditional child with its nurse, resulted from conjugal tenderness and\r\nconsiderateness. It must be confessed that there are some indications\r\nof well-arranged management in the foregoing account. The friend who\r\nhappened to[i.109] call at the house the \"next day,\" and who was able\r\nto supply what the \"poor babe\" needed, certainly came very opportunely;\r\nand there was altogether a remarkable concurrence and sequence of\r\ncircumstances. But all that he saw was a case of suffering, helpless\r\ninnocence, and an opportunity for benevolence and charity; and in\r\nthese, with a true theology, he read \"a providence of God.\" That child\r\ncontinued, to the hour when he took his last farewell of his family,\r\nbeneath his roof, and was an object of affectionate care, and in her\r\namiable qualities a source of happiness to him and his good wife. It is\r\nstated that the children, thus from time to time domesticated in the\r\nfamily, called him father, and that he addressed them as his children.\r\nWhile they were infants, he was \"a tender nursing father\" to them. When\r\nfondling them in his arms, in the presence of his wife, he would\r\nsolemnly take notice of the providence of God that had \"disposed of\r\nthem from one place to another\" until they had been brought to him; and\r\n\"would present them in his desires to God, and implore a blessing upon\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nThe picture presented in the foregoing details is worth rescuing from\r\noblivion. Such instances of actual life, exhibited in the most private\r\nspheres, constitute a branch of history more valuable, in some\r\nrespects, than the public acts of official dignitaries. History has\r\nbeen too exclusively confined, in its materials, to the movements of\r\nstates and of armies. It ought to paint the portraits of individual men\r\nand[i.110] women in their common lives; it ought to lead us into the\r\ninterior of society, and introduce us to the family circles and home\r\nexperiences of the past. It cannot but do us good to know Thomas\r\nLothrop, not only as an early counsellor among the legislators of the\r\ncolony, and as having immortalized by his blood a memorable field of\r\nbattle and slaughter, but as the centre of a happy and virtuous\r\nhousehold on a New England farm. He made that home happy by his\r\nbenignant virtue. Although denied the blessing of children of his own,\r\nhis fireside was enlivened with the prattle and gayeties of the young.\r\nJoy and hope and growth were within his walls. He was not a parent; but\r\nhis heart was kept warm with parental affections. He had a home where\r\ndear ones waited for him, and rushed out to meet and cling round him\r\nwith loving arms, and welcome him with merry voices, when he returned\r\nfrom the sessions of the General Court, or from campaigns against the\r\nFrench and Indians.\r\n\r\nBesides these offices of beneficence in the domestic sphere, we find\r\ntraces, in the local records, of constant usefulness and kindness among\r\nhis rural neighbors. He was called, on all occasions, to advise and\r\nassist. As a judicious friend, he was relied upon and sought at the\r\nbedside of the sick and dying, and in families bereaved of their head.\r\nHis name appears as a witness to wills, appraiser of estates, trustee\r\nand guardian of the young. He was the friend of all. I know not where\r\nto find a more perfect union of the hero and[i.111] the Christian; of\r\nall that is manly and chivalrous with all that is tender, benevolent,\r\nand devout.\r\n\r\nSomewhere about the year 1650, after he had been married a considerable\r\ntime, he revisited his native country. A sister, Ellen, had, in the\r\nmean while, grown up from early childhood; and he found her all that a\r\nfond brother could have hoped for. With much persuasion, he besought\r\nhis mother to allow her to return with him to America. He stated that\r\nhe had no children; that he would be a father to her, and watch over\r\nand care for her as for his own child. At length the mother yielded,\r\nand committed her daughter to his custody, not without great\r\nreluctance, trusting to his fraternal affection and plighted promise.\r\nHe brought her over with him to his American home. She was worthy of\r\nhis love, and he was true to his sacred and precious trust.\r\n\r\nEllen Lothrop became the wife of Ezekiel Cheever, the great\r\nschoolmaster; and I should consider myself false to all good learning,\r\nif I allowed the name of this famous old man to slip by, without\r\npausing to pay homage to it. His record, as a teacher of a Latin\r\nGrammar School, is unrivalled. Twelve years at New Haven, eleven at\r\nIpswich, nine at Charlestown, and more than thirty-eight at\r\nBoston,—more than seventy in all,—may it not be safely said that he was\r\none of the very greatest benefactors of America? With Elijah Corlett,\r\nwho taught a similar school at Cambridge for more than forty years, he\r\nbridged over the wide chasm between the education brought with\r\nthem[i.112] by the fathers from the old country, and the education that\r\nwas reared in the new. They fed and kept alive the lamp of learning\r\nthrough the dark age of our history. All the scholars raised here were\r\ntrained by them. One of Cotton Mather's most characteristic productions\r\nis the tribute to his venerated master. It flows from a heart warm with\r\ngratitude. \"Although he had usefully spent his life among children, yet\r\nhe was not become twice a child,\" but held his faculties to the last.\r\n\"In this great work of bringing our sons to be men, he was my master\r\nseven and thirty years ago, was master to my betters no less than\r\nseventy years ago; so long ago, that I must even mention my father's\r\ntutor for one of them. He was a Christian of the old fashion,—an old\r\nNew England Christian; and I may tell you, that was as venerable a\r\nsight, as the world, since the days of primitive Christianity, has ever\r\nlooked upon. He lived, as a master, the term which has been, for above\r\nthree thousand years, assigned for the life of a man.\" Mather\r\ncelebrated his praises in a poetical effusion:—\r\n\r\n\"He lived, and to vast age no illness knew,\r\nTill Time's scythe, waiting for him, rusty grew.\r\nHe lived and wrought; his labors were immense,\r\nBut ne'er declined to preterperfect tense.\r\n\r\n*       *      *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Tis Corlett's pains, and Cheever's, we must own,\r\nThat thou, New England, art not Scythia grown.\"\r\n\r\nTo our early schoolmasters, as Mather says, and the later too, I may\r\nadd, it is owing, that the whole country did not become another\r\nScythia.[i.113]\r\n\r\nEzekiel Cheever was in this country as early as 1637. He was then in\r\nNew Haven, sharing in the work of the first settlement of that colony,\r\nteaching school as his ordinary employment, but sometimes preaching,\r\nand in other ways helping to lay the foundations of church and\r\ncommonwealth. While there, he had a family of several children. The\r\nfirst-born, Samuel, became the minister of Marblehead. In 1650, he was\r\nkeeping a school at Ipswich. About this time, he lost his wife. On the\r\n18th of November, 1652, he married Ellen, the sister whom Captain\r\nLothrop had brought with him from England. They had several children;\r\none of them, Thomas, was ordained first at Malden, and afterwards at\r\nChelsea. The old schoolmaster died on the 21st of August, 1708, aged\r\nninety-three years and seven months. His son Thomas reached the same\r\nage. Samuel, the minister at Marblehead, was eighty-five years old at\r\nhis death. The name of Ezekiel, jr., appears on the rate-list of the\r\nvillage parish as late as 1731, so that he must have reached the age of\r\nat least seventy-seven years.\r\n\r\nThe antiquarians have been sorely perplexed in determining the\r\nrelationship of the Cheevers and Reas, as they appear to be connected\r\ntogether as heirs of the Lothrop property, in an order of the General\r\nCourt of the 11th of June, 1681.\r\n\r\nThe facts are these: Captain Lothrop married Bethia, daughter of Daniel\r\nRea. He died without issue, and had made no will. As he was killed in\r\nbattle, his widow undertook to set up a nuncupative[i.114] will. A\r\nsnow-storm, on the day appointed to act upon the matter, so blocked up\r\nthe roads, that neither Ezekiel Cheever nor his son Thomas, who had\r\ncharge of his mother's rights, could get to Salem; and the court\r\ngranted administration to the widow. The Cheevers demanded a rehearing:\r\nit was granted; and quite an interesting and pertinacious law-suit\r\narose, which was finally carried up to the General Court, who decided\r\nit in 1681. The widow does not appear to have been actuated by merely\r\nselfish motives, but sought to divert a portion of the landed estate\r\nfrom the only legal heir, Ellen, the wife of Ezekiel Cheever, to other\r\nparties, in favor of whom her feelings were much enlisted. There is no\r\nindication of any unfriendliness between her and her \"sister Cheever.\"\r\n\r\nLothrop's wife had become much attached to one of her connections, who\r\nhad been brought into the family. Her husband, having been fond of\r\nchildren, had often expressed great affection for those of her brother,\r\nJoshua Rea. He had also sometimes, in expressing his interest in the\r\nBeverly Church, evinced a disposition to leave to it \"his ten acre lot\r\nand his house upon the same,\" as a parsonage. Perhaps, if he had not\r\nbeen suddenly called away, he might have done something, particularly\r\nfor the latter object. It appeared in evidence, from her statements and\r\nfrom others, that he had been importuned to make a will, and that it\r\nwas much on his mind, particularly when recovering from a long and\r\ndangerous sickness the winter before his death; but he never could\r\nbe[i.115] brought to do it. There was no evidence that he had ever\r\nabsolutely determined on any thing positively or specifically. His\r\nwidow, who seems to have been a perfectly honest and truthful woman,\r\ntestified to a conversation that passed between them on the subject, as\r\nthey were riding \"together towards Wenham, the last spring, in the week\r\nbefore the Court of election.\" In passing by particular pieces of\r\nproperty owned by him, he indulged in some speculations as to what\r\ndisposal he should make of this or that pasture or plain or woodland.\r\nBut she did not represent that his expressions were absolute and\r\ndeterminate, but rather indicative of the then inclination of his mind.\r\nIn another part of her statement, she said, \"I did desire him to make\r\nhis will, which, when he was sick, I did more than once or twice; and\r\nhis answer to me was, that he did look upon it as that which was very\r\nrequisite and fit should be done. But, dear wife, thou hast no cause to\r\nbe troubled; if I should die and not make a will, it would be never the\r\nworse for thee; thyself would have the more.\" It is not difficult to\r\nunderstand the case as it probably stood in the mind of Captain\r\nLothrop. Whenever the subject of making a will, and doing kind things\r\nfor the Beverly parish, and the individuals in whose behalf his wife\r\nwas so anxious, was brought up, he felt the force, as he expressed it,\r\n\"of the duty which God required of a master of a family to set his\r\nhouse in order;\" and he was no doubt strongly moved, and sometimes\r\nalmost resolved, to gratify her wishes: but he remembered the[i.116]\r\nsolemn promise he had made to his mother, as he parted from her for\r\never, and received his sister from her hands, and every sentiment of\r\nhonor, and of filial and fraternal love, restrained him; and his mind\r\nsettled into a conviction that it was his duty to allow his sister the\r\nbenefit of the final inheritance of his property. As the particular\r\npersons to whom his wife wished him to make bequests were her\r\nrelatives, and the law would give her an ample allowance in the use,\r\nfor life, of his large landed property, she would be able to provide\r\nfor them after his death, as he had been in the habit of doing.\r\n\r\nThe General Court took a just view of the case, and decided that she\r\nshould have the whole movable estate for her own \"use and dispose,\" and\r\nthe \"use and benefit\" for life of the houses and lands, \"making no\r\nstrip nor waste;\" after her death, the same to go to Ellen, the wife of\r\nEzekiel Cheever. The widow was to pay all debts due from the estate,\r\nand also twenty pounds to the children of her brother, Joshua Rea. The\r\nCourt seemed to think, that, if any expectations had been excited in\r\nthat quarter, she was fully as responsible for it as her late husband;\r\nand, as the Cheevers were to get nothing, while she lived, out of the\r\nestate, the Court required her to pay the sum just named to her nephews\r\nand nieces. They ordered Ezekiel Cheever to pay five pounds as costs\r\nfor their hearing the case, which he did on the spot.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned, by the way, that the widow of Captain Lothrop was\r\nmarried again within eight[i.117] months of his death; but that was\r\nquite usual in those days. She and her new husband concluded that it\r\nwould be troublesome to take care of Captain Lothrop's several farms.\r\nThey preferred to live in the town. She was probably over sixty years\r\nof age. The conclusion of the whole matter was, that, in consideration\r\nof sixty pounds paid down, they surrendered all claim whatever to the\r\n\"houseing and lands\" left by Captain Lothrop, to Cheever and his wife.\r\nThey conveyed them \"free and clear of and from all debts owing from the\r\nestate of said Lothrop, and gifts or bequests pretended to be made by\r\nhim, or by any ways or means to be had, claimed, or challenged\r\ntherefrom by any person or persons whomsoever.\" The relict of Captain\r\nLothrop died in 1688.\r\n\r\nEzekiel Cheever and his wife, having thus become possessed of all her\r\nbrother's real estate, conveyed the lands belonging to it in Salem\r\nVillage to their son, Ezekiel Cheever, Jr. He had, for some years, been\r\nliving in the town of Salem, carrying on the business of a tailor. He\r\nwas a member of the First Church, and appears to have been a\r\nrespectable person. His dwelling-house stood on the lot in Washington\r\nStreet occupied by the late Robert Brookhouse. He sold it to the Rev.\r\nNicholas Noyes, on the 14th of April, 1684, removed to the village,\r\ntook possession of the Lothrop farm, and was there in time to bear a\r\nshare in the witchcraft delusion.\r\n\r\nIn 1636, a grant of land was made to Thomas Gardner of one hundred\r\nacres. He came to this[i.118] country as early as 1624, and resided at\r\nCape Ann. Subsequently he removed to Salem, and, with his wife, was\r\nadmitted to the church. He was deputy to the General Court in 1637. His\r\ngrant was in the western part of the township, and embraced land\r\nincluded within the limits of Salem Village. The name still remains on\r\nthe same territory. His sons became proprietors of several additional\r\ntracts in the neighborhood. One of them, Joseph, is connected, in the\r\nmost conspicuous and interesting manner, with our military history.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of Captain Lothrop and his company, on the 18th of\r\nSeptember, filled the country with grief and consternation; and, as the\r\nyear 1675 drew towards a close, the conviction became general, that the\r\ncrisis of the fate of the colonies was near at hand. The Indians were\r\ncarrying all before them. Philip was spreading conflagration,\r\ndevastation, and slaughter around the borders, and striking sudden and\r\ndeadly blows into the heart of the country. It was evident that he was\r\nconsolidating the Indian power into irresistible strength. Among papers\r\non file in the State House is a letter addressed to the governor and\r\ncouncil, dated at Mendon, Oct. 1, 1675, from Lieutenant Phinehas Upham,\r\nof Malden. In command of a company, acting under Captain Gorham of\r\nBarnstable, who had also a company of his own, he had been on a scout\r\nfor Indians beyond Mendon, which was a frontier town. Their route had\r\nbeen over a sweep of territory then an almost un[i.119]broken\r\nwilderness, embracing the present sites of Grafton, Worcester, Oxford,\r\nand Dudley. The result of the exploration is thus given: \"Now, seeing\r\nthat in all our marches we find no Indians, we verily think that they\r\nare drawn together into great bodies far remote from these parts.\" From\r\nother scouting parties, it became evident that this opinion was\r\ncorrect, and that the Indians were collecting stores and assembling\r\ntheir warriors somewhere, to fall upon the colonies at the first\r\nopening of spring. Further information made it certain, that their\r\nplace of gathering was in the Narragansett country, in the\r\nsouth-westerly part of the colony of Rhode Island. There was no\r\nalternative but, as a last effort, to strike the enemy at that point,\r\nwith the utmost available force. A thousand men were raised, 527 by\r\nMassachusetts, 315 by Connecticut, and 158 by Plymouth. Massachusetts\r\norganized a company of cavalry and six companies of foot soldiers,\r\nConnecticut five and Plymouth two companies of foot. All were placed\r\nunder the command of Governor Winslow, of Plymouth. The winter had set\r\nin earlier than usual; much snow had fallen, and the weather was\r\nextremely cold. The seven companies of Massachusetts, under the command\r\nof Major Samuel Appleton of Ipswich, started on their march, Dec. 10.\r\nOn the evening of the 12th, having effected a junction with the\r\nPlymouth companies, they reached the rendezvous, on the north side of\r\nWickford Hill, in North Kingston, R.I. On the 13th, Winslow commenced\r\nhis move upon the enemy. On the 18th,[i.120] the Connecticut troops\r\njoined him. His army was complete; the enemy was known to be near, and\r\nall haste made to reach him. The snow was deep. The Narragansetts were\r\nintrenched on a somewhat elevated piece of ground of five or six acres\r\nin area, surrounded by a swamp, within the limits of the present town\r\nof South Kingston. The Indian camp was strongly fortified by a double\r\nrow of palisades, about a rod apart, and also by a thick hedge. There\r\nwas but a single entrance known to our troops, which could only be\r\nreached, one at a time, over a slanting log or felled tree, slippery\r\nfrom frost and falling snow, about six feet above a ditch. There were\r\nother passages, known only to the Indians, by which they could steal\r\nout, a few at a time, and get a shot at our people in the flank and\r\nrear. Many of our men were cut off in this way. The allied forces had\r\nexpected to pass the night, previous to reaching the hostile camp, at a\r\ngarrison about fifteen miles distant from that point; but the Indians\r\nhad destroyed the buildings, and slaughtered the occupants, seventeen\r\nin number, two days before. Here the troops passed the night,\r\nunsheltered from the bitter weather. The next day, Dec. 19, was Sunday;\r\nbut their provisions were exhausted, and the supply they had expected\r\nto find had been destroyed with the garrison-house. There could be no\r\ndelay. They recommenced their march, at half-past five o'clock in the\r\nmorning, through the deep snow, which continued falling all day, and\r\nreached the borders of what was described, by a[i.121] writer well\r\nacquainted with it, as \"a hideous swamp.\" Fortunately, the early and\r\nlong-continued extreme cold weather of that winter had rendered it more\r\npassable than it otherwise would have been. But the ground was rough,\r\nand very difficult to traverse. They were chilled and worn by their\r\nlong march, following winding paths through thick woods, across\r\ngullies, and over hills and fields. It was between one and two o'clock\r\nin the afternoon, and the short winter day was wearing away. Winslow\r\nsaw the position at a glance, and, by the promptness of his decision,\r\nproved himself a great captain. He ordered an instant assault. The\r\nMassachusetts troops were in the van; the Plymouth, with the\r\ncommander-in-chief, in the centre; the Connecticut, in the rear. The\r\nIndians had erected a block-house near the entrance, filled with\r\nsharp-shooters, who also lined the palisades. The men rushed on,\r\nalthough it was into the jaws of death, under an unerring fire. The\r\nblock-house told them where the entrance was. The companies of Moseley\r\nand Davenport led the way. Moseley succeeded in passing through.\r\nDavenport fell beneath three fatal shots, just within the entrance.\r\nIsaac Johnson, captain of the Roxbury company, was killed while on the\r\nlog. But death had no terrors to that army. The centre and rear\r\ndivisions pressed up to support the front and fill the gaps; and all\r\nequally shared the glory of the hour. Enough survived the terrible\r\npassage to bring the Indians to a hand-to-hand fight within the fort.\r\nAfter a desperate struggle of nearly three hours, the[i.122] savages\r\nwere driven from their stronghold; and, with the setting of that sun,\r\ntheir power was broken. Philip's fortunes had received a decided\r\noverthrow, and the colonies were saved. In all military history, there\r\nis not a more daring exploit. Never, on any field, has more heroic\r\nprowess been displayed. By the best computations, the Indian loss was\r\nat least one thousand, including the large numbers who perished from\r\ncold, as they scattered in their flight without shelter, food, or place\r\nof refuge. Of the colonial force, over eighty were killed, and one\r\nhundred and fifty wounded. Three of the Massachusetts captains—Johnson,\r\nGardner, and Davenport—were killed on the spot. Three of the\r\nConnecticut captains—John Gallop, Samuel Marshall, and Robert\r\nSeely—also fell in the fight. Captain William Bradford, of Plymouth,\r\nwas wounded by a musket-ball, which he carried in his body to his\r\ngrave. Captain John Gorham, also of the Plymouth colony, was shortly\r\nafter carried off by a fever, occasioned by the over-exhaustion of the\r\nmarch and the battle. Lieutenant Phinehas Upham, of Johnson's company,\r\nwas mortally wounded. Great value appears to have been attached to the\r\nservices of this officer. In the hurried preparation for the campaign,\r\nCaptain Johnson had nominated his brother as his lieutenant. The\r\nGeneral Court overruled the appointment. Johnson cheerfully acquiesced,\r\nand, in a paper addressed to the Court, assured them that he \"most\r\nreadily submitted to their choice of Lieutenant Upham.\" This single\r\npassage is an imperishable eulo[i.123]gium upon the characters of the\r\ntwo brave men who gave their lives to the country on that fatal but\r\nglorious day.\r\n\r\nCaptain Gardner's company was raised in this neighborhood. Joseph\r\nPeirce and Samuel Pikeworth of Salem, and Mark Bachelder of Wenham,\r\nwere killed before entering the fort. Abraham Switchell of Marblehead,\r\nJoseph Soames of Cape Ann, and Robert Andrews of Topsfield, were killed\r\nat the fort. Charles Knight, Thomas Flint, and Joseph Houlton, Jr., of\r\nSalem Village; Nicholas Hakins and John Farrington, of Lynn; Robert\r\nCox, of Marblehead; Eben Baker and Joseph Abbot, of Andover; Edward\r\nHarding, of Cape Ann; and Christopher Read, of Beverly,—were wounded.\r\nAn account of the death of Captain Gardner, in detail, has been\r\npreserved. The famous warrior, and final conqueror of King Philip,\r\nBenjamin Church, was in the fight as a volunteer, rendered efficient\r\nservice, and was wounded. His \"History of King Philip's War\" is\r\nreprinted, by John Kimball Wiggin, as one of his series of elegant\r\neditions of rare and valuable early colonial publications entitled\r\n\"Library of New England History.\" In the second number, Part I. of\r\nChurch's history is edited by Henry Martyn Dexter. Church's account of\r\nwhat came within his observation in this fight, with the notes of the\r\nlearned editor, is the most valuable source of information we have in\r\nreference to it. He says, that, in the heat of the battle, he came\r\nacross Gardner, \"amidst the wigwams in the east end of the fort,[i.124]\r\nmaking towards him; but, on a sudden, while they were looking each\r\nother in the face, Captain Gardner settled down.\" He instantly went to\r\nhim. The blood was running over his cheek. Church lifted up his cap,\r\ncalling him by name. \"Gardner looked up in his face, but spoke not a\r\nword, being mortally shot through the head.\" The widow of Captain\r\nGardner (Ann, sister of Sir George Downing) became the successor of Ann\r\nDudley, the celebrated poetess of her day, by marrying Governor\r\nBradstreet, in 1680. She died in 1713.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious parallelism between the first and the last great\r\nvictory over the Indian power in the history of America. An interval of\r\none hundred and sixty one years separates them. On the 19th of\r\nDecember, 1836,—the anniversary of the day when Winslow stormed the\r\nNarragansett fort,—Colonel Taylor received his orders to pursue the\r\nFlorida Indians. It was a last attempt to subdue them. They had long\r\nbaffled and defied the whole power of the United States. Every general\r\nin the army had laid down his laurels in inglorious and utter failure.\r\nHe started on the 20th, with an army of about one thousand men. On the\r\n25th, he found himself on the edge of a swamp, impassable by artillery\r\nor horses. On the opposite side were the Indian warriors, ready to deal\r\ndestruction, if he should attempt to cross the swamp. He had the same\r\nquestion to decide which Winslow had; and he decided it in the same\r\nway, with equal promptness. The struggle lasted about the same time;\r\nand[i.125] the loss, in proportion to the numbers engaged, was about\r\nthe same. The results were alike permanently decisive. Okee-cho-bee\r\nstands by the side of Narragansett, and the names of Josiah Winslow and\r\nZachary Taylor are imperishably inscribed together on the tablets of\r\nmilitary glory.\r\n\r\nDr. Palfrey says that Captain Nathaniel Davenport was a son of\r\n\"Davenport of the Pequot War.\" He was born in Salem, and brought up in\r\nthe village. His name, with those of his brave father, and his\r\nassociate in youth and in death Joseph Gardner, belongs to our local\r\nannals. They were both the idols of their men. Davenport was dressed,\r\nwhen he fell, in a \"full buff suit,\" and was probably thought by the\r\nIndians to be the commander-in-chief. On receiving his triple wound, he\r\ncalled his lieutenant, Edward Tyng, to him, gave him his gun in charge,\r\ndelivered over to him the command of his company, and died.\r\n\r\nThere has been some uncertainty on the point whether Nathaniel\r\nDavenport was a son of Richard, the commandant at the castle. The fact\r\nthat he was associated with William Stoughton, and Stephen Minot whose\r\nwife was a daughter of Richard Davenport, as an administrator of the\r\nestate of the latter, has been regarded as rendering it probable. Dr.\r\nPalfrey's unhesitating statement to that effect is, of itself, enough\r\nto settle the question. There is, moreover, a document on file which\r\nproves that he is correct. Nathaniel's widow had some difficulty in\r\nsettling his estate, and applied to the General Court for its\r\ninterposition.[i.126] Quite a mass of papers belong to the case. Among\r\nthem is a bill of expenses incurred by her in connection with his\r\nfuneral charges, such as, \"twenty-one rings to relatives,\" and to those\r\n\"who took care to bring him off slain, eight pounds;\" and \"for mourning\r\nfor my mother Davenport, sisters Minot and Elliot, and myself, sixteen\r\npounds.\" This latter item is decisive, as we know that two of Richard\r\nDavenport's daughters married persons of those names. It is a\r\ncircumstance of singular interest, as showing by how slight an\r\naccident—for it is a mere accident—important questions of history are\r\nsometimes determinable. This item, so far as I have been able to find,\r\nis the only absolute evidence we have to the point that Richard was the\r\nfather of Nathaniel Davenport; and it would not have been in existence,\r\nhad not questions arisen in the settlement of the estate of the latter\r\nrequiring the action of the General Court. The record of baptisms in\r\nthe First Church at Salem, prior to 1636, is lost. The names of Richard\r\nDavenport's children, baptized subsequent to that date, are in the\r\nrecords of the Salem or Boston churches. As Nathaniel is understood to\r\nhave been one of the earliest born, the record of his baptism was\r\nprobably in the lost part of the Salem book.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought surprising, that so little appears to have been known\r\nconcerning an officer of his rank and parentage, and whose death has\r\nrendered his name so memorable. To account for it, I must recur to the\r\nhistory of the Narragansett expedition. No military organization was\r\never more rapidly effected, or more[i.127] thoroughly and promptly\r\nexecuted its work. The commissioners of the three united colonies were\r\nsatisfied that the Indian rendezvous at Narragansett, where their\r\nforces and stores were being collected and their resources\r\nconcentrated, must be struck at without a moment's delay; that the blow\r\nmust be swift and decisive; that it must be struck then, in the depth\r\nof winter; that, if deferred to the spring, all would be lost; that, if\r\nthe Indian power was allowed to remain and to gather strength until the\r\nnext season, nothing could save the settlements from destruction. Early\r\nin November, they formed their plan, and put the machinery for\r\nsummoning all their utmost resources into instant action. On the 30th\r\nof November, the officers appointed for the purpose made return, that\r\nthey had impressed the required number in the several counties and\r\ntowns, fitted them out with arms, ammunition, clothes, and all\r\nnecessary equipments; that the men were on the ground, ready to go\r\nforward. There was no time for recruiting, or raising bounties, or\r\nsubstitute brokerage; no time for electioneering to get commissions.\r\nThe rank and file were ready: they had been brought in by a process\r\nthat gave no time for canvassing for offices. A summons had been left\r\nat the house of every drafted man, to report himself the next morning.\r\nIf any one failed to appear, some other member of the family, brother\r\nor father, had to take his place. The organizing and officering of this\r\nforce must be done instanter. All depended upon suitable officers being\r\nselected. A company was wait[i.128]ing at Boston for a captain, and a\r\ncaptain must be found. Some one in authority happened to think of\r\nNathaniel Davenport. His childhood and youth had been passed at Salem\r\nVillage and on Castle Island: on reaching maturity, he had removed to\r\nNew York, and been there for years in commercial pursuits. A short time\r\nbefore, he had returned to Boston, and engaged in business there. His\r\nfather had been dead since 1665, and not many persons knew him,—only,\r\nperhaps, a few of his early associates, and the old friends of his\r\nfather: but they knew, that, from his birth to his manhood, he had\r\nbreathed a military atmosphere,—was a soldier, by inheritance, of the\r\nschool of Lothrop, Read, and Trask; and it was determined at once to\r\nhunt him up. He was serving at Court; taken out of the jury-box in a\r\npending trial; and placed at the head of the company. The accurate\r\nhistorian of Boston, Samuel G. Drake, says, \"Captain Davenport's men\r\nwere extremely grieved at the death of their leader; he having, by his\r\ncourteous carriage, much attached them to himself, although he was a\r\nstranger to most of them when he was appointed their captain. On which\r\noccasion he made 'a very civil speech,' and allowed them to choose\r\ntheir sergeants themselves.\" He had no time to settle his accounts,\r\narrange his affairs, or confer with any one, but led his company at\r\nonce to the rendezvous. These circumstances, perhaps, partially explain\r\nwhy so little seems to have been known of him in Boston, or to local\r\nwriters.[i.129]\r\n\r\nBesides Captains Gardner and Davenport and the men whose names have\r\nbeen mentioned as killed or wounded, there were in the Narragansett\r\nfight the following from Salem Village and its farming neighborhood:\r\nJohn Dodge, William Dodge, William Raymond, Thomas Raymond, John\r\nRaymond, Joseph Herrick, Thomas Putnam, Jr., Thomas Abbey, Robert\r\nLeach, and Peter Prescott. There may have been others: no full roll is\r\non record. The foregoing are gathered from partial returns\r\nmiscellaneously collected in the files at the State House. The Dodges\r\n(sometimes the name is written Dodds, which appears, I think, to have\r\nbeen its original form), and the Raymonds (sometimes written Rayment),\r\nwere, from the first, conspicuous in military affairs. A few words\r\nexplanatory of their relation to the village may be here properly\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of January, 1635, the town of Salem voted to William Trask,\r\nJohn Woodbury, Roger Conant, Peter Palfrey, and John Balch, a tract of\r\nland, as follows: \"Two hundred acres apiece together lying, being at\r\nthe head of Bass River, one hundred and twenty-four poles in breadth,\r\nand so running northerly to the river by the great pond side, and so in\r\nbreadth, making up the full quantity of a thousand acres.\" These men\r\nwere original settlers, having been in the country for some time before\r\nEndicott's arrival. This circumstance gave to them and others the\r\ndistinguishing title of \"old planters.\" The grant of a thousand acres,\r\ncomprising the five farms above mentioned, was always known as \"the Old\r\nPlanters' Farms.\" The[i.130] first proprietors of them, and their\r\nimmediate successors, appear to have arranged and managed them in\r\nconcert,—to have had homesteads near together between the head of Bass\r\nRiver and the neighborhood of the \"horse bridge,\" where the\r\nmeeting-house of the Second Congregational Society of Beverly, or of\r\nthe \"Precinct of Salem and Beverly\" now stands. Their woodlands and\r\npasture lands were further to the north and east. An inspection of the\r\nmap will give an idea of the general locality of the \"Old Planters'\r\nFarms\" in the aggregate—above the head of Bass River, extending\r\nnortherly towards \"the river,\" as the Ipswich River was called, and\r\neasterly to the \"great pond,\" that is, Wenham Lake. Conant, Woodbury,\r\nand Balch occupied their lands at once. I have stated how Trask's\r\nportion of the grant went into the hands of Scruggs, and then of John\r\nRaymond. Palfrey is thought never to have occupied his portion. He sold\r\nit to William Dodge, the founder of the family of that name, known by\r\nway of eminence as \"Farmer Dodge,\" whose wife was a daughter of Conant.\r\nA portion of the grant assigned to Conant was sold by one of his\r\ndescendants to John Chipman, who, on the 28th of December, 1715, was\r\nordained as the first minister of the \"Second Beverly Society.\" He was\r\nthe grandfather of Ward Chipman, Judge of the Supreme Court, and for\r\nsome time President, of the Province of New Brunswick, and whose son of\r\nthe same name was chief-justice of that court. He was also grandfather\r\nof the wife of the great merchant, William Gray,[i.131] whose family\r\nhas contributed such invaluable service to the literature, legislation,\r\njudicial learning, and general welfare of the country. The Rev. Mr.\r\nChipman was the ancestor of many other distinguished persons. The house\r\nin which he lived is still standing, near the site of the church in\r\nwhich he preached. It is occupied by his descendants, bearing his name,\r\nand, although much time-worn, has the marks of having been a structure\r\nof a very superior order for that day. The venerable mansion stands\r\nback from the road, on a smooth and beautiful lawn, bordered by a solid\r\nstone wall of even lines and surfaces. In these respects it well\r\ncompares with any country residence upon which taste, skill, and wealth\r\nhave, in more recent times, been bestowed.\r\n\r\nThe dividing line between Beverly and Salem Village, as seen on the\r\nmap, finally agreed upon in 1703, ran through the \"Old Planters'\r\nFarms,\" particularly the portions belonging to the Dodges, Raymonds,\r\nand Woodbury. It went through \"Captain John Dodge's dwelling-house, six\r\nfoot to the eastward of his brick chimney as it now stands.\" At the\r\ntime of the witchcraft delusion, the Raymonds and Dodges mostly\r\nbelonged to the Salem Village parish and church. They continued on the\r\nrate-list, and connected with the proceedings entered on the\r\nrecord-books, until the meeting-house at the \"horse bridge\" was opened\r\nfor worship, in 1715, when they transferred their relations to the\r\n\"Precinct of Salem and Beverly.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Sir William Phipps got up his expedition[i.132] against Quebec, in\r\n1690, William Raymond raised a company from the neighborhood; and so\r\ndeep was the impression made upon the public mind by his ability and\r\ncourage, and so long did it remain in vivid remembrance, that, in 1735,\r\nthe General Court granted a township of land, six miles square, \"to\r\nCaptain William Raymond, and the officers and soldiers\" under his\r\ncommand, and \"to their heirs,\" for their distinguished services in the\r\n\"Canada Expedition.\" The grant was laid out on the Merrimack, but,\r\nbeing found within the bounds of New Hampshire, a tract of equivalent\r\nvalue was substituted for it on the Saco River. Among the men who\r\nserved in this expedition was Eleazer, a son of Captain John Putnam,\r\nwho afterwards, for many years, was one of the deacons of the Salem\r\nVillage Church.\r\n\r\nThe short, rapid, sharp, and sanguinary campaign against the\r\nNarragansetts seems to have tried to the utmost, not only the courage\r\nand spirit of the men, but the powers of human endurance. The\r\nconstitutions of many were permanently impaired. As much fatigue and\r\nsuffering were crowded into that short month as the physical forces of\r\nstrong men could bear. We find such entries as this in the\r\ntown-books:—\"Salem, 1683. Samuel Beadle, who lost his health in the\r\nNarragansett Expedition, is allowed to take the place of Mr. Stephens\r\nas an innkeeper.\" A petition, dated in 1685, is among the papers in the\r\nState House, signed by men from Lynn, the Village, Beverly, Reading,\r\nand Hingham, praying for a grant of land, for[i.133] their services and\r\nsufferings in that expedition. The petition was granted. The following\r\nextract from it tells the story: \"We think we have reason to fear our\r\ndays may be much shortened by our hard service in the war, from the\r\npains and aches of our bodies, that we feel in our bones and sinews,\r\nand lameness thereby taking hold of us much, especially in the spring\r\nand fall.\"\r\n\r\nWhile there is \"reason to fear\" that the days of many were shortened,\r\nthere were some so tough as to survive the strain, and bid defiance to\r\naches and pains, and almost to time itself. In a list of fourteen who\r\nwent from Beverly, six, including Thomas Raymond and Lott, a descendant\r\nof Roger Conant, were alive in 1735!\r\n\r\nThe grants of land made to these gallant men and their heirs amounted\r\nin all, and ultimately, to seven distinct tracts, called \"Narragansett\r\nTownships.\" They were made in fulfilment of an express public promise\r\nto that effect. It is stated in an official document, that\r\n\"proclamation was made to them, when mustered on Dedham Plain\" on the\r\n9th of December, just as they took up their march, \"that, if they\r\nplayed the man, took the fort, and drove the enemy out of the\r\nNarragansett country, which was their great seat, they should have a\r\ngratuity in land, besides their wages.\" The same document, which is in\r\nthe form of a message from the House of Representatives to the Council\r\nof the Province of Massachusetts, dated Jan. 10, 1732, goes on to say,\r\n\"And as the condition has been performed, certainly the promise, in all\r\nequity and justice,[i.134] ought to be fulfilled. And if we consider\r\nthe difficulties these brave men went through in storming the fort in\r\nthe depth of winter, and the pinching wants they afterwards underwent\r\nin pursuing the Indians that escaped, through a hideous wilderness,\r\nknown throughout New England to this day by the name of the _hungry\r\nmarch_; and if we further consider, that, until this brave though small\r\narmy thus played the man, the whole country was filled with distress\r\nand fear, and we trembled in this capital, Boston itself; and that to\r\nthe goodness of God to this army we owe our fathers' and our own safety\r\nand estates,\"—therefore they urge the full discharge of the obligations\r\nof public justice and gratitude. They did not urge in vain. The grants\r\nwere made on a scale, that finally was liberal and honorable to the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt at this great length on the Narragansett campaign and\r\nfight, partly because the details have not been kept as familiar to the\r\nmemory of the people as they deserve, but chiefly because they\r\ndemonstrate the military genius of the community with whose character\r\nour subject requires us to be fully acquainted. The enthusiasm of the\r\ntroops, when Winslow gave the order for the assault, was so great, that\r\nthey rushed over the swamp with an eagerness that could not be\r\nrestrained, struggling as in a race to see who could first reach the\r\nlog that led into the fiery mouth of the fort. A Salem villager, John\r\nRaymond, was the winner. He passed through, survived the ordeal, and\r\ncame unharmed out of the terrible fight.[i.135] He was twenty-seven\r\nyears of age. He signed his name to a petition to the General Court, in\r\n1685, as having gone in the expedition from Salem Village, and as then\r\nliving there. Some years afterwards, he removed to Middleborough,\r\njoined the church in that place in 1722, and died in 1725. The fact\r\nthat his last years were spent there has led to the supposition that he\r\nwent from Middleborough to the Narragansett fight; but no men were\r\ndrafted into that army from Middleborough. It was not a town at the\r\ntime, but was organized some years afterwards. It had no inhabitants\r\nthen. Philip had destroyed what few houses had been there, and\r\nslaughtered or dispersed their occupants.\r\n\r\nThus far our attention has been directed to that portion of the\r\npopulation of Salem Village drawn there by the original policy of the\r\ncompany in London to attract persons of superior social position,\r\nwealth, and education to take up tracts of land, and lead the way into\r\nthe interior. It operated to give a high character to the early\r\nagriculture of the country, and facilitate the settling of the lands.\r\nWithout taking into view the means they had to make the necessary\r\noutlays in constructing bridges and roads, and introducing costly\r\nimplements of husbandry and tasteful improvements, but looking solely\r\nat the social, intellectual, and moral influence they exerted, it must\r\nbe acknowledged that the benefit derived from them was incalculable.\r\nThey gave a powerful impulse to the farming interest, and introduced a\r\nhigh tone to the[i.136] spirit of the community. They were early on the\r\nground, and remained more or less through the period of the first\r\ngeneration. Their impress was long seen in the manners and character of\r\nthe people. There was surely a goodly proportion of such men among the\r\nfirst settlers of this neighborhood.\r\n\r\nI come now to another class drawn along with and after the\r\npreceding,—the permanent, substantial yeomanry with no capital but\r\ntheir sturdy industry, doing hard work with their strong arms, and\r\nstriking the roots of the settlement down deep into the soil by mixing\r\ntheir own labor with it. A glance at the map will be useful, at this\r\npoint, showing the general direction by which the farming population\r\nadvanced to the interior. All between the North and Cow House Rivers\r\nwas, as now, called North Fields, and is still for the most part a\r\nfarming territory. All north of Cow House River, westwardly to Reading\r\nand eastwardly to the sea, was originally known as the \"Farms\" or\r\n\"Salem Farms.\" When the First Beverly Parish was set off in 1667, it\r\ntook from the \"Farms\" all east of Bass River. As Topsfield and other\r\ntownships were established, they were more or less encroached upon. The\r\n\"Farmers\" as they were called, although unorganized, regarded\r\nthemselves as one community, having a common interest. The tide of\r\nsettlement flowed up the rivers and brooks, sought out the meadows, and\r\nwas drawn into the valleys among the hills.\r\n\r\nJohn Porter, called \"Farmer Porter,\" came with[i.137] his sons from\r\nHingham, and bought up lands to the north of Duck or Crane River. His\r\nfamily before long held among them more land, it is probable, than any\r\nother. He served many years as deputy in the General Court, first from\r\nHingham and then from Salem. He is spoken of in the colonial records of\r\nMassachusetts as \"of good repute for piety, integrity, and estate.\" The\r\nBarneys, Leaches, and others went eastwardly towards Bass River. The\r\nPutnams followed up Beaver Brook to Beaver Dam, and spread out towards\r\nthe north and west; while Richard Hutchinson turned southerly to the\r\ninterval between Whipple and Hathorne Hills, bought the Stileman grant,\r\nand cleared the beautiful meadows where the old village meeting-house\r\nafterwards stood. He was a vigorous and intelligent agriculturist, and\r\na man of character. He died in 1681, at eighty years of age, leaving a\r\nlarge and well-improved estate. His will has this item: I give \"five\r\nacres of land to Black Peter, my servant.\" He had given fine farms to\r\nhis children severally, many years before his death. His second wife,\r\nwho survived him, had no children. He had come by her into possession\r\nof a valuable addition to his estate. After distributing his property,\r\nand providing legacies for children and grandchildren, his will left it\r\nto the option of his widow to spend the residue of her days either in\r\nthe family of his son Joseph, or elsewhere; if she should prefer to\r\nlive elsewhere, then she should receive back, in her own right, all the\r\nproperty she had originally owned; if she continued[i.138] to live to\r\nher death in Joseph's family, then her property was to go to him and\r\nhis heirs. This, I think, shows that he was as sagacious as he was\r\njust.\r\n\r\nRichard Ingersoll came from Bedfordshire in England in 1629, bringing\r\nletters of recommendation from Matthew Cradock to Governor Endicott.\r\nAfter living awhile in town, a tract of land of eighty acres was\r\ngranted to him, on the east side of Wooleston River, opposite the site\r\nof Danversport, at a place called, after him, Ingersoll's Point. He\r\nthere proceeded to clear and break ground, plant corn, fence in his\r\nland, and make other improvements. He also carried on a fishery.\r\nSubsequently he leased the Townsend Bishop farm, where he lived several\r\nyears. He died in 1644. Not long before his death, he purchased,\r\njointly with his son-in-law Haynes, the Weston grant. His half of it he\r\nbequeathed to his son Nathaniel. He was evidently a man of real dignity\r\nand worth, enjoying the friendship of the best men of his day. Governor\r\nEndicott and Townsend Bishop were with him in his last sickness, and\r\nwitnesses to his will. His widow married John Knight of Newbury. In a\r\nlegal instrument filed among the papers connected with a case of land\r\ntitle, dated twenty-seven years after her first husband's death, she\r\nexpresses in very striking language the tender affection and respect\r\nwith which she still cherished his memory.\r\n\r\nWilliam Haynes married Sarah, daughter of Richard Ingersoll, and\r\noccupied his half of the Weston grant. In company with his brother,\r\nRichard Haynes, he[i.139] had before bought of Townsend Bishop five\r\nhundred and forty acres, covering a considerable part of the northern\r\nend of the village territory. They sold one-third part of it to Abraham\r\nPage. Page sold to Simon Bradstreet, and John Porter bought all the\r\nthree parts from the Hayneses and Bradstreet. It long constituted a\r\nportion of the great landed property of the Porter family. These facts\r\nshow that William Haynes was a person of means; and the manner in which\r\nhe is uniformly spoken of proves that he was regarded with singular\r\nrespect and esteem. He died about 1650, and his son Thomas became\r\nsubsequently a leading man in the village.\r\n\r\nThere has been uncertainty where William Haynes came from, or to what\r\nfamily of the name he belonged. Among the papers of the Ingersoll\r\nfamily, it has recently been found that he is mentioned as \"brother to\r\nLieutenant-Governor Haynes.\" There seems to be no other person to whom\r\nthis language can refer than John Haynes, who, after being Governor of\r\nMassachusetts, removed to Connecticut where he was governor and\r\ndeputy-governor, in alternate years, to the day of his death. John\r\nHaynes, as Winthrop informs us, was a gentleman of \"great estate.\" His\r\nproperty in England is stated to have yielded a thousand pounds per\r\nannum. Dr. Palfrey says he was \"a man of family as well as fortune; and\r\nthe dignified and courteous manners, which testified to the care\r\nbestowed on his early nurture, won popularity by their graciousness, at\r\nthe same time that they diffused a refining[i.140] influence by their\r\nexample.\" If William of the village was brother to John of Connecticut,\r\nthe fact that he and his brother Richard could make such large\r\npurchases of lands, and the remarkable respect manifested towards him,\r\nare well accounted for. The Ingersoll family traditions and entries\r\nwould seem to be the highest authority on such a point.\r\n\r\nJob Swinnerton was a brother of John who for many years was the\r\nprincipal physician in the town of Salem. He had several grants of\r\nland, and was a worthy, peaceable, unobtrusive citizen. He seems to\r\nhave kept out of the heat of the various contentions that occurred in\r\nthe village; and, although his influence was sometimes decisively put\r\nforth, he evidently did nothing to aggravate them. He died April 11,\r\n1689, over eighty-eight years of age. He had a large family, and his\r\ndescendants continue the name in the village to this day. Daniel Rea\r\ncame originally to Plymouth, and in 1630 bought a dwelling-house,\r\ngarden, and \"all the privileges thereunto belonging,\" in that town. In\r\n1632 he removed to Salem, and at once became a leading man in the\r\nmanagement of town affairs. He had a grant of one hundred and sixty\r\nacres, which he occupied and cultivated till his death in 1662. He had\r\nbut two children: one, the wife of Captain Lothrop; the other, Joshua\r\nRea, became the founder of a large family who acted conspicuously in\r\nthe affairs of the village for several generations. Jacob Barney was an\r\noriginal grantee, and for several years a deputy. His son of[i.141] the\r\nsame name became a large landholder, and, on the 5th of April, 1692, at\r\nthe very moment when the witchcraft delusion was at its height, gave\r\ntwo acres conveniently situated for the erection of a schoolhouse. He\r\nconveyed it to inhabitants of the neighborhood to be used for that\r\npurpose, mentioning them severally by name. I give the list, as it\r\nshows who were the principal people thereabouts at the time: \"Mr.\r\nIsrael Porter; Sergeant John Leach; Cornet Nathaniel Howard, Sr.;\r\nCorporal Joseph Herrick, Sr.; Benjamin Porter; Joshua Rea, Sr.; Thomas\r\nRaymond, Sr.; Edward Bishop, _secundus_; John Trask, Jr.; John Creesy;\r\nJoshua Rea, Jr.; John Rea; John Flint, Sr.\" Lawrence Leach received a\r\ngrant of one hundred acres; and others of the same name and family had\r\nsimilar evidence that they were regarded as valuable accessions to the\r\npopulation. William Dodge and Richard Raymond had grants of sixty acres\r\neach; Humphrey and William Woodbury had forty each. The families of\r\nLeach, Raymond, Dodge, and Woodbury, still remain in the community of\r\nwhich their ancestors were the founders. John Sibley had a grant of\r\nfifty acres. Robert Goodell was a grantee, and became a large\r\nlandholder.\r\n\r\nThe descendants of the two last-named persons are very numerous, and\r\nhave maintained the respectability of their family names. They are\r\neach, at this day, represented by gentlemen whose enthusiastic interest\r\nin our antiquities is proved by their invaluable labors and\r\nacquisitions in the interesting depart[i.142]ments of genealogy and\r\nlocal history,—John L. Sibley, Librarian of Harvard University; and\r\nAbner C. Goodell, Register of Probate for the County of Essex.\r\n\r\nBesides Townsend Bishop, there were two other persons of that name\r\namong the original inhabitants of Salem. They do not appear to have\r\nbeen related to him or to each other. Richard Bishop, whose wife\r\nDulcibell had died Aug. 6, 1658, married the widow Galt, July 22, 1660.\r\nHe died Dec. 30, 1674.\r\n\r\nEdward Bishop was in Salem in 1639, and became a member of the church\r\nin 1645. In 1660 he was one of the constables of Salem, an original\r\nmember of the Beverly Church in 1667, and died in January, 1695. He was\r\nan early settler on the Farms; his lands were on both sides of Bass\r\nRiver, the parcels on the west side being above and below the Ipswich\r\nroad. His own residence was on the Beverly side; and he was not usually\r\nconnected with the concerns of the village. His name appears but once\r\nin the witchcraft proceedings, and then in favor of an accused person.\r\n\r\nEdward Bishop, commonly called \"the sawyer,\" from the tenor of\r\nconveyances of land, dates, and other evidences, appears to have been a\r\nson of the preceding. In his earlier life, he was somewhat notable for\r\nirregularities and aberrations of conduct. With his wife Hannah, he was\r\nfined by the local court, in 1653, for depredating upon the premises of\r\nhis neighbors. During the subsequent period of his history, he\r\nbore[i.143] the character of an industrious and reputable person. At\r\nsome time previous to 1680, he married Bridget, widow of Thomas Oliver.\r\nOn the 9th of March, 1693, he married Elizabeth Cash. He lived\r\noriginally in Beverly; afterwards, at different times, on the land\r\nbelonging to his father in Salem Village,—the estate he occupied being\r\non both sides of the Ipswich road. His last years were passed in the\r\ntown of Salem. He died in 1705. His daughter Hannah, born in 1646,\r\nbecame the wife of Captain William Raymond, one of the founders of the\r\nnumerous family of that name.\r\n\r\nEdward Bishop, son of the preceding, called, for distinction,\r\n\"husbandman,\" was born in 1648. He married Sarah, daughter of William\r\nWilds, of Ipswich. He was a respectable person, and lived in the\r\nvillage on an estate also occupied by \"the sawyer.\" His house was west\r\nof the avenue leading to Cherry Hill. In 1703 he removed to Rehoboth.\r\n\r\nEdward Bishop, the eldest of his sons, married Susanna, daughter of\r\nJohn Putnam, and in 1713 removed to that part of Ipswich now Hamilton.\r\nPrior to 1695, these four Edward Bishops were all living; and the\r\nyoungest had a wife and children. All will be found connected with our\r\nstory, the second and third prominently. The fourth owed his safety,\r\nperhaps, to the influential connections of his wife.\r\n\r\nThe first notice we have of Bray Wilkins is in the Massachusetts\r\ncolonial records, Sept. 6, 1638, when he was authorized to set up a\r\nhouse and keep a ferry at Neponset River, and have \"a penny a person.\"\r\nOn[i.144] the 5th of November, 1639, the General Court accepted a\r\nreport made by William Hathorne and Richard Davenport, commissioners\r\nappointed for the purpose, and, in accordance therewith, laid out a\r\nfarm for Richard Bellingham, who had been deputy-governor, was then an\r\nassistant, and afterwards governor, \"on the head of Salem, to the\r\nnorth-west of the town; there being in it a hill, and an Indian\r\nplantation, and a pond.\" This nice little farm included seven hundred\r\nacres, and \"about one hundred or one hundred and fifty acres of meadow\"\r\nbeside. The next thing we hear about the matter is a petition to the\r\nGeneral Court, May 22, 1661, of \"Bray Wilkins and John Gingle, humbly\r\ndesiring that the farm called by the name of Will's Hill, which this\r\nCourt granted to the worshipful Richard Bellingham, Esq., and they\r\npurchased of him, may be laid to, and appointed to belong to, Salem;\r\nbeing nigh its lands, and the petitioners of its society.\" The Court\r\ngranted the request. It seems that, about a year before, on the 9th of\r\nMarch, \"Bray Wilkins, husbandman, and John Gingle, tailor, both of\r\nLynn,\" had bought the Bellingham farm for two hundred and fifty pounds,\r\nof which they paid at the time twenty-five pounds, and mortgaged it\r\nback for the residue. The twenty-five pounds was paid as follows:\r\ntwenty-four pounds in a ton of bar-iron, and one pound in money.\r\nWilkins had, some time before, removed from Neponset, and perhaps had\r\nbeen working in one of the iron-manufactories then in operation at\r\nLynn. When the balance of his wages over his[i.145] expenses enabled\r\nhim, with the aid of Gingle, to raise a ton of iron and scrape together\r\ntwenty shillings, they entered upon their bold undertaking. He had not\r\na dollar in his pocket; but he had what was better than\r\ndollars,—industrious habits, a resolute will, a strong constitution, an\r\niron frame, and six stout sons. After a while, he took into the work,\r\nin addition to his own effective family force, two trusty kinsmen,\r\nAaron Way and William Ireland, conveying to them good farms out of his\r\nseven hundred acres. He enlarged his farm, from time to time, by new\r\npurchases, so as to more than make up for what he sold to Way and\r\nIreland. In 1676 the mortgage was fully discharged. He and his sons\r\nbought out the heirs of Gingle, and the work was done. They held, free\r\nfrom debt, in one tract, a territory about two miles in length on the\r\nReading line. Each member of the family had a house, barns, orchards,\r\ngardens, meadows, upland, and woodland; and the homestead of the old\r\npatriarch was in the midst of them, the enterprise of his laborious\r\nlife crowned with complete success. The innumerable family of the name,\r\nscattered all over the country, has largely, if not wholly, been\r\nderived from this source. Bray Wilkins, and the members of his\r\nhousehold in all its branches, were always on hand at parish meetings\r\nin Salem Village. Over a distance, as their route must have been, of\r\nfive miles, they came, in all seasons and all weathers, by the roughest\r\nroads, and, in the earlier period, where there were no roads at all,\r\nthrough the woods, fording streams, to[i.146] meeting on the Lord's\r\nDay. He continued vigorous, hale, and active to the last; and died, as\r\nhe truly characterizes himself in his will, \"an ancient,\" Jan. 1, 1702,\r\nat the age of ninety-two.\r\n\r\nThis was the way in which the large grants made to wealthy and eminent\r\npersons, governors, deputy-governors, and assistants, came into the\r\npossession and under the productive labor of a yeomanry who made good\r\ntheir title to the soil by the force of their characters and the\r\nstrength of their muscles. One of the terms of Wilkins's purchase was,\r\nthat, if he found and wrought minerals on the land, he was to pay to\r\nBellingham or his heirs a royalty of ten pounds per annum. Believing\r\nthat the best mine to be found in land is the crops that can be raised\r\nfrom it, he never tried to find any other.\r\n\r\nBray Wilkins will appear to have shared in the witchcraft delusion, and\r\nbeen very unhappily connected with it; but he lived to behold its\r\ntermination, and to participate in the restoration of reason. The\r\nminister of the parish at the time of his death, the Rev. Joseph Green,\r\nkept a diary which has been preserved. He thus speaks of the old man:\r\n\"He lived to a good old age, and saw his children's children, and their\r\nchildren, and peace upon our little Israel.\"\r\n\r\nIt is rather curious to notice such indications as the mineral clause\r\nin Wilkins's deed affords of the prevalent expectation, at the\r\nbeginning of settlements in this region, that valuable minerals would\r\nbe found in it. What makes it worthy of particular inquiry is, that\r\nthey[i.147] were found and wrought for some time, but that no one\r\nthinks of looking after them now. Simon Bradstreet, Daniel Dennison,\r\nand John Putnam put up and carried on together, upon a large scale,\r\niron-works, in 1674, at Rowley Village, now Boxford. Samuel and Nathan\r\nLeonard were employed to construct them, and carried them on by\r\ncontract. These iron-works were long regarded as a promising enterprise\r\nand valuable investment. The Leonards were probably of the same family\r\nthat, at Raynham and the neighborhood, engaged in this business to a\r\ngreat extent, and for a long period, making it a source of wealth and\r\nthe foundation of eminent families. We know that the business was\r\ncarried on extensively in Lynn, and that Governor Endicott was quite\r\nsure that he had found copper on his Orchard Farm. Who knows but that\r\nmodern science and more searching methods of detection may yet discover\r\nthe hidden treasures of which the fathers caught a glimpse, and their\r\nenterprises be revived and conducted with permanent energy and success?\r\n\r\nIn 1669, Joseph Houlton testified, that, when he was about twenty years\r\nof age, in 1641, he was \"a servant to Richard Ingersoll,\" and worked on\r\nhis land at Ingersoll's Point. About the year 1652, he married Sarah,\r\ndaughter of Richard Ingersoll, and widow of William Haynes. By her he\r\nhad five sons and two daughters, who lived to maturity. He gave to each\r\nof them a farm; and their houses were in his near neighborhood. The\r\nsons were respectable and substantial[i.148] citizens, and persons of\r\njust views and amiable sentiments. The father was one of the honored\r\nheads of the village, and lived to a good old age. He died May 30,\r\n1705. From him, it is probable, all of the name in this country have\r\nsprung. It will be for ever preserved in the public annals and on the\r\ngeographical face of the country. Samuel Houlton, great-grandson of the\r\noriginal Joseph, was a representative of Massachusetts for ten years in\r\nthe old Congress of the Confederation, for a time presiding over its\r\ndeliberations. He was also a member of the first Congress under the\r\nConstitution, and subsequently, for a very long period, Judge of\r\nProbate for the county of Essex. He was a true patriot and wise\r\nlegislator; enjoyed to an extraordinary degree the confidence and love\r\nof the people; had a commanding person and a noble and venerable\r\naspect; and was always conspicuous by the dignity and courtesy of his\r\nmanners. He was a physician by profession; but his whole life was spent\r\nin the public service. He was in both branches of the Legislature of\r\nthe State, also in the Executive Council. He was major of the Essex\r\nregiment at the opening of the Revolution; was a member of the\r\nCommittee of Safety, and of every convention for the framing of the\r\nGovernment; and, for more than thirty years, a judge of the Court of\r\nCommon Pleas. He died, where he was born and had his home for the\r\ngreater part of his life, in Salem Village, Jan. 2, 1816, in the\r\nseventy-eighth year of his age.\r\n\r\nIn 1724 a petition was presented to the Legislature,[i.149] commencing\r\nas follows: \"Whereas Salem is a most ancient town of Massachusetts\r\nProvince, and very much straitened for land,\" the petitioners pray for\r\na grant in the western part of the province. The petition was allowed\r\non condition that one lot be reserved for the first settled minister,\r\none for the ministry, and one for a school. Each grantee was required\r\nto give a bond of twenty-five pounds to be on the spot; have a house of\r\nseven feet stud and eighteen square at least, seven acres of English\r\nhay ready to be mowed, and help to build a meeting-house and settle a\r\nminister, within five years. A grandson of Joseph Houlton, of the same\r\nname, led the company that emigrated to the assigned location. The\r\nfirst result was the town of New Salem, in Franklin County,\r\nincorporated in 1753; named in honor of the old town from which their\r\nleading founder had come. But the people were not satisfied with having\r\nmerely a school. They must have an academy. They went to work with a\r\nwill, and an academy was established and incorporated in 1795. This was\r\nthe second result. The academy did not flourish to an extent to suit\r\ntheir views, and they beset the Legislature to grant them a township of\r\nland in the woods of Maine to enable them to endow it. They carried\r\ntheir point, and in 1797 obtained the grant. The effort had been great,\r\nand great was the rejoicing at its successful issue. But, as bad luck\r\nwould have it, just at that time land could not be sold at any price.\r\nThe grant became worthless; and deep and bitter was the disappointment\r\nof the people of[i.150] New Salem. The doom of the academy seemed to be\r\nsettled, and its days numbered and finished. But there were men in New\r\nSalem who were determined that the academy should be saved. They met in\r\nconsultation, and, under the lead of still another Joseph Houlton, of\r\nthe same descent, fixed their purpose. They sold or mortgaged their\r\nfarms, which more than half a century of labor had rendered productive,\r\nand which every association and every sentiment rendered dear to them.\r\nWith the money thus raised they bought the granted tract, paying a good\r\nprice for it. The preservation and endowment of the academy were thus\r\nsecured; but all benefit from it to themselves or their descendants was\r\nwholly relinquished. It was the only way in which the academy could be\r\nsaved. Some must make the sacrifice, and they made it. They packed up\r\nbag and baggage; sold off all they could not carry; gathered their\r\nfamilies together; bid farewell to the scenes of their birth and\r\nchildhood, the homes of their life, and the fruits of their labor; and\r\nstarted in wagons and carts on the journey to Boston. Their location\r\nwas hundreds of miles distant, far down in the eastern wilderness, and\r\ninaccessible from the extremes of settlement at that time on the\r\nPenobscot. As the only alternative, they embarked in a coasting-vessel;\r\nwent down the Bay of Fundy to St. John, N.B.; took a river-sloop up to\r\nFredericton,—a hundred miles; got up the river as they could, in barges\r\nor canoes, eighty miles further to Woodstock; and there, turning to the\r\nleft, struck[i.151] into the forest, until they reached their location.\r\nThe third result of this emigration, in successive generations and\r\nstages, from Salem Farms, is to be seen to-day in a handsome and\r\nflourishing village, interspersed and surrounded with well-cultivated\r\nfields,—the shire town of the county of Aroostook, in the State of\r\nMaine; which bears the name of the leader of this disinterested,\r\nself-sacrificing, and noble company. Three times was it the lot of this\r\none family to encounter and conquer the difficulties, endure and\r\ntriumph over the privations, and carry through the herculean labors, of\r\nsubduing a rugged wilderness, and bringing it into the domain of\r\ncivilization,—at Salem Village, New Salem, and Houlton. It would be\r\ndifficult to find, in all our history, a story that more strikingly\r\nthan this illustrates the elements of the glory and strength of New\r\nEngland,—zeal for education,—enterprise invigorated by\r\ndifficulties,—and prowess equal to all emergencies.\r\n\r\nJohn Burton came early to Salem by way of Barbadoes. He combined the\r\npursuits of a farmer and a tanner. He was a sturdy old Englishman, who,\r\nwhile probably holding the theological sentiments that prevailed in his\r\nday, abhorred the spirit of persecution, and was unwilling to live\r\nwhere it was allowed to bear sway. He does not appear to have been a\r\nQuaker, but sympathized with all who suffered wrong. In 1658, he went\r\noff in their company to Rhode Island, sharing their banishment. But his\r\nconscience would not let him rest in voluntary flight. He came[i.152]\r\nback in 1661, to bear his testimony against oppression. He was brought\r\nbefore the Court, as an abettor and shelterer of Quakers. He told the\r\njustices that they were robbers and destroyers of the widows and\r\nfatherless, that their priests divined for money, and that their\r\nworship was not the worship of God. They commanded him to keep silent.\r\nHe commanded them to keep silent. They thought it best to bring the\r\ncolloquy to a close by ordering him to the stocks. They finally\r\nconcluded, upon the whole, to let him alone; and he remained here the\r\nrest of his life. His descendants are through a daughter (who married\r\nWilliam Osborne) and his son Isaac. They are numerous, under both\r\nnames. Isaac was an active and respectable citizen of the village, and\r\na farmer of enterprise and energy. He carried on, under a lease,\r\nGovernor Endicott's farm of over five hundred acres on Ipswich River,\r\nand had lands of his own. In subsequent generations, this family\r\nbranched off in various directions to Connecticut, Vermont, and\r\nelsewhere. One detachment of them went to Wilton, N.H., where the\r\nfamily still remains on the original homestead. The late Warren Burton,\r\nwho was born in Wilton,—a graduate of Harvard College in the class of\r\n1821, and well known for his invaluable services in the cause of\r\neducation, philanthropy, and letters,—was a direct descendant of John\r\nBurton, and as true to the rights of conscience as the old tanner, who\r\nbearded the lion of persecution in the day of his utmost wrath, and in\r\nhis very den.[i.153]\r\n\r\nHenry Herrick, who, as has been stated, purchased the Cherry-Hill farm\r\nof Alford, was the fifth son of Sir William Herrick, of Beau Manor\r\nPark, in the parish of Loughborough, in the county of Leicester,\r\nEngland. He came first to Virginia, and then to Salem. He was\r\naccompanied to America by another emigrant from Loughborough, named\r\nCleaveland. Herrick became a member of the First Church at Salem in\r\n1629, and his wife Edith about the same time. Their fifth son, Joseph,\r\nbaptized Aug. 6, 1645, owned and occupied Cherry Hill in 1692. He\r\nmarried Sarah, daughter of Richard Leach, Feb. 7, 1667. He was a man of\r\ngreat firmness and dignity of character, and, in addition to the care\r\nand management of his large farm, was engaged in foreign commerce. As\r\nhe bore the title of Governor, he had probably been at some time in\r\ncommand of a military post or district, or perhaps of a West-India\r\ncolony. His descendants are numerous, and have occupied distinguished\r\nstations, often exhibiting a transmitted military stamp. Joseph Herrick\r\nwas in the Narragansett fight. It illustrates the state of things at\r\nthat time, that this eminent citizen, a large landholder, engaged in\r\nprosperous mercantile affairs, and who had been abroad, was, in 1692,\r\nwhen forty-seven years of age, a corporal in the village company. He\r\nwas the acting constable of the place, and, as such, concerned in the\r\nearly proceedings connected with the witchcraft prosecutions. For a\r\nwhile he was under the influence of the delusion; but his strong and\r\nenlightened mind soon led him out of it. He was one of[i.154] the\r\npetitioners in behalf of an accused person, when intercession, by any\r\nfor any, was highly dangerous; and he was a leader in the party that\r\nrose against the fanaticism, and vindicated the characters of its\r\nvictims. He inherited a repugnance to oppression, and sympathy for the\r\npersecuted. His father and mother appear, by a record of Court, to have\r\nbeen fined \"for aiding and comforting an excommunicated person,\r\ncontrary to order.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Nichols, in 1651, bought two hundred acres, which had been\r\ngranted to Henry Bartholomew, partly in the village, but mostly beyond\r\nthe \"six-mile extent,\" and consequently set off to Topsfield. He had\r\nseveral other lots of land. He distributed nearly all his real estate,\r\nduring his lifetime, to his son John; his adopted son, Isaac Burton;\r\nhis daughters, the wives of Thomas Wilkins and Thomas Cave; and his\r\ngrand-daughter, the wife of Humphrey Case. His only son John had\r\nseveral sons, and from them the name has been widely dispersed. In a\r\ndeposition dated May 14, 1694, William Nichols declares himself \"aged\r\nupwards of one hundred years.\" As his will was offered for Probate Feb.\r\n24, 1696, he must have been one hundred and two years of age at his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cantlebury was a large landholder, having purchased\r\nthree-quarters of the Corwin grant. He died June 1, 1663. His name died\r\nwith him, as he had no male issue. His property went to his daughters,\r\nwho were represented, in 1692, under the names of Small, Sibley, and\r\nBuxton. The Flints, Popes,[i.155] Uptons, Princes, Phillipses,\r\nNeedhams, and Walcotts, had valuable farms, and appear, from the\r\nrecords and documents, to have been respectable, energetic, and\r\nintelligent people. Daniel Andrew was one of the strong men of the\r\nvillage; had been a deputy to the General Court, and acted a prominent\r\npart before and after the witchcraft convulsion. But the great family\r\nof the village—greater in numbers and in aggregate wealth than any\r\nother, and eminently conspicuous on both sides in the witchcraft\r\nproceedings—remains to be mentioned.\r\n\r\nJohn Putnam had a grant of one hundred acres, Jan. 20, 1641. With his\r\nwife Priscilla, he came from Buckinghamshire, England, and was probably\r\nabout fifty years of age on his arrival in this country. He was a man\r\nof great energy and industry, and acquired a large estate. He died in\r\n1662, leaving three sons,—Thomas, born in 1616; Nathaniel, in 1620; and\r\nJohn, in 1628. For a more convenient classification, I shall, in\r\nspeaking of this family, refer, not to the original John at all, but to\r\nthe sons as its three heads.\r\n\r\nThomas, the eldest, inherited a double share of his father's lands. He\r\nwas of age when he came to America, and had received a good education.\r\nHe appears to have settled, in the first instance, in Lynn, where for\r\nseveral years he acted as a magistrate, holding local courts, by\r\nappointment of the General Court. Upon removing to Salem, he was\r\nchosen, as the town-records show, to the office of constable. This was\r\nconsidered at that time as quite a distinguished position,\r\ncarrying[i.156] with it a high authority, covering the whole executive\r\nlocal administration. Thomas Putnam was the first clerk of Salem\r\nVillage, and acted prominently in military, ecclesiastical, and\r\nmunicipal affairs. He seems to have been a person of a quieter\r\ntemperament than his younger brothers, and led a somewhat less stirring\r\nlife. Possessing a large property by inheritance, he was not quite so\r\nactive in increasing it; but, enjoying the society and friendship of\r\nthe leading men, lived a more retired life. At the same time, he was\r\nalways ready to serve the community if called for, as he often was,\r\nwhen occasion arose for the aid of his superior intelligence and\r\npersonal influence. He married first, while in Lynn, Ann, daughter of\r\nEdward Holyoke, great-grandfather of the President of Harvard College\r\nof that name whose son, the venerable centenarian, Dr. Edward Augustus\r\nHolyoke, is remembered as a true Christian philosopher by the\r\ngeneration still lingering on the stage. Having lost his wife on the\r\n1st of September, 1665, he married, on the 14th of November, 1666,\r\nMary, widow of Nathaniel Veren; coming, through her, into possession of\r\nproperty in Jamaica and Barbadoes, in which places Veren had resided,\r\nmore or less, in the prosecution of commercial business. His homestead,\r\nas shown on the map, was occupied by his widow in 1692, and, after her\r\ndeath, by her son Joseph, the father of General Israel Putnam. He had\r\nalso a town residence on the north side of Essex Street, extending back\r\nto[i.157] the North River. Its front on Essex Street embraced the\r\nwestern part of the grounds now occupied by the North Church, and\r\nextended to a point beyond the head of Cambridge Street. He left the\r\neastern half of this property to his son Thomas, and the western half\r\nto his son Joseph. To his son Edward he left another estate in the\r\ntown, on the western side of St. Peter's Street, to the north of\r\nFederal Street.\r\n\r\nThomas Putnam died on the 5th of May, 1686. He left large estates in\r\nthe village to each of his children, and a valuable piece of meadow\r\nland, of fifteen acres, to a faithful servant.\r\n\r\nNathaniel Putnam married Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Hutchinson,\r\nand, besides what he received from his father, came, through his wife,\r\ninto possession of seventy-five acres. On that tract he built his house\r\nand passed his life. The property has remained uninterruptedly in his\r\nfamily. One of them, the late Judge Samuel Putnam, of the Supreme Court\r\nof Massachusetts, enjoyed it as a country residence, and it is still\r\nheld by his children. Nathaniel Putnam was a deputy to the General\r\nCourt, and constantly connected with all the interests of the\r\ncommunity. He had great business activity and ability, and was a person\r\nof extraordinary powers of mind, of great energy and skill in the\r\nmanagement of affairs, and of singular sagacity, acumen, and quickness\r\nof perception. He died July 23, 1700, leaving a numerous family and a\r\nlarge estate.\r\n\r\nJohn Putnam had the same indefatigable activity as[i.158] Nathaniel. He\r\nwas often deputy to the General Court, and accumulated a very great\r\nlanded property. He married Rebecca Prince, step-daughter of John\r\nGedney, and died on the 7th of April, 1710. He was buried with military\r\nhonors. He left a large family of sons and daughters. We shall often\r\nmeet him in our narrative, and gather the materials, as we go along, to\r\nform an opinion of his character. The earliest rate-list in the parish\r\nrecord book is for 1681. At that time the three brothers were all\r\nliving; the aggregate sum assessed upon ninety-four names was two\r\nhundred pounds. The rate of Thomas was £10. 6_s._ 3_d._; that of\r\nNathaniel, £9. 10_s._; that of John, £8. No other person paid as much\r\nas either of them.\r\n\r\nThese brothers, as well as many others of the large landholders in the\r\nvillage, adopted the practice of giving to their sons and sons-in-law,\r\noutright, by deed, good farms, as soon as they became heads of\r\nfamilies; so that, as the fathers advanced in life, their own estates\r\nwere gradually diminished; and, when unable any longer to take an\r\nactive part in managing their lands, they divided up their whole\r\nremaining real estate, making careful contracts with their children for\r\nan adequate maintenance, to the extent of their personal wants and\r\ncomfort. Joseph Houlton did this: so did the widow Margery Scruggs, old\r\nWilliam Nichols, Francis Nurse, and many others. In his last years,\r\nJohn Putnam was on the rate-list for five shillings only, while all his\r\nsons and daughters were assessed severally in large sums. In this way\r\nthey had the satisfac[i.159]tion of making their children independent,\r\nand of seeing them take their places among the heads of the community.\r\n\r\nWhere this practice was followed, there were few quarrels in families\r\nover the graves of parents, and controversies seldom arose about the\r\nprovisions of wills. In some cases no wills were needed to be made. It\r\nis apparent, that, in many respects, this was a wise and good practice.\r\nIt was, moreover, a strictly just one. As the sons were growing to an\r\nadult age, they added, by their labors, to the value of lands,—inserted\r\na property into them that was truly their own; and their title was duly\r\nrecognized. In a new country, land has but little value in itself; the\r\nvalue is imparted by the labor that clears it and prepares it to yield\r\nits products. In 1686, Nathaniel Putnam testified that for more than\r\nforty years he had lived in the village, and that in the early part of\r\nthat time unimproved land brought only a shilling an acre, while a cow\r\nwas worth five pounds. In 1672, the rate of taxation on unimproved land\r\nwas a half penny per acre, and, for land on which labor had been\r\nexpended, a penny per acre. In 1685 it was taxed at the rates of three\r\nshillings for a hundred acres of wild land, and one penny an acre for\r\n\"land within fence.\" The relative value of improved land constantly\r\nincreased with the length of time it had been under culture. It may be\r\nsaid that labor added two-thirds to the value of land, and that he who\r\nby the sweat of his brow added those two-thirds, to that extent owned\r\nthe land. An industrious young man went out into his[i.160] father's\r\nwoods, cut down the trees, cleared the ground, fenced it in, and\r\nprepared it for cultivation. All that was thus added to its value was\r\nhis creation, and he its rightful owner. The right was recognized, and\r\nfull possession given him, by deed, as soon as he had opened a farm,\r\nand built a house, and brought a wife into it.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this was to anchor a family, from generation to\r\ngeneration, fast to its ancestral acres. It strengthened the ties that\r\nbound them to their native fields. Its moral effect was beyond\r\ncalculation. When a young man was thus enabled to start in life on an\r\nindependent footing, it made a man of him while he was young. It\r\ninvested him with the dignity of a citizen by making him feel his share\r\nof responsibility for the security and welfare of society. It gave\r\nscope for enterprise, and inspiration to industry, at home. It led to\r\nearly marriages, under circumstances that justified them. Joseph\r\nPutnam, the youngest son of Thomas, at the age of twenty years and\r\nseven months, took as his bride Elizabeth, daughter of Israel Porter,\r\nand grand-daughter of William Hathorne, when she was sixteen years and\r\nsix months old. We shall see what a valuable citizen he became; and she\r\nwas worthy of him. A large and noble family of children grew up to\r\nhonor them, one of the youngest of whom was Israel Putnam, of\r\nillustrious Revolutionary fame.\r\n\r\nThough there were descendants of this family in every company of\r\nemigrants that went forth from[i.161] Salem Village, in all directions,\r\nin every generation, to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Maine,\r\nand all parts of the New England, Middle, Western, and Pacific States,\r\nthere is about as large a proportionate representation of the name\r\nwithin the precincts of Salem Village to-day, as there ever was. Fifty\r\nPutnams are at present voters in Danvers, on a list of eight hundred\r\nnames,—one-sixteenth of the whole number. The rate-schedule of 1712\r\nshows almost precisely the same proportion.\r\n\r\nEdward Putnam, whom we shall meet again, was baptized July 4, 1654.\r\nAfter serving as deacon of the church from its organization, a period\r\nof forty years, he resigned on account of advancing age; and in 1733,\r\nas he was entering on his eightieth year, gave this account of his\r\nfamily: \"From the three brothers proceeded twelve males; from these\r\ntwelve males, forty males; and from these forty males, eighty-two\r\nmales: there were none of the name of Putnam in New England but those\r\nfrom this family.\" With respect to their situation in life, he remarks:\r\n\"I can say with the Psalmist, I have been young, and now am old; yet I\r\nhave not seen the righteous forsaken, nor their seed begging bread\r\nexcept of God, who provides for all. For God hath given to the\r\ngeneration of my fathers a generous portion, neither poverty nor\r\nriches.\" When the infirmities of age prevented his longer partaking in\r\nthe worship of the Lord's Day, this good old man relinquished his\r\nresidence near the church, and removed to his original homestead,\r\nin[i.162] the neighborhood of his children, which had then been\r\nincluded in the new town of Middleton. His will is dated March 11,\r\n1731. It was offered in Probate, April 11, 1748. After making every\r\nreasonable deduction, in view of his share of responsibility for the\r\nearlier proceedings in the witchcraft prosecutions, we may participate\r\nin the affection and veneration with which this amiable and\r\ngentle-hearted man was regarded by his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of his will contain items which so strikingly illustrate\r\nhis character, and give us such an insight of the domestic life of the\r\ntimes, that a few of them will be presented. According to the prevalent\r\ncustom, he had given good farms to his several children when they\r\nbecame heads of families. In his will, he distributes the residue of\r\nhis real estate among them with carefulness and an equal hand,\r\ndescribing the metes and bounds of the various tracts with great\r\nminuteness, so as to prevent all questions of controversy among them.\r\nHe gives legacies in money to his daughters, ten pounds each; and, to\r\nhis grand-daughters, five pounds each. To one of his five sons, he\r\ngives his \"cross-cut saw.\" This was used to saw large logs crosswise,\r\nhaving two handles worked by two persons, and distinguished from the\r\n\"pit saw,\" which was used to saw logs lengthwise. All his other tools\r\nwere to be divided among his sons, to one of whom he also gives his\r\ncane; to another, his \"Great Bible;\" to another, \"Mr. Jeremiah\r\nBurroughs's Works;\" to another, \"Mr. Flavel's Works;\" and, to the\r\nother, his[i.163] \"girdle and sword.\" To one of them he gives his desk,\r\nand \"that box wherein are so many writings;\" to another, his \"share in\r\nthe iron-works;\" and to another, his share \"in the great timber chain.\"\r\nThis, with other evidence, shows that there was a boom, and\r\narrangements on a large scale for the lumbering business, at that time,\r\non Ipswich River. The provisions for his wife were very considerate,\r\nexact, and minute, so as to prevent all possibility of there being any\r\ndifficulty in reference to her rights, or of her ever suffering want or\r\nneglect. He gives to her, absolutely and for her own disposal, the\r\nresidue of his books and all his \"movable estate\" in the house and out\r\nof it, including all \"cattle, sheep, swine,\" the whole stock of the\r\nhomestead farm, agricultural implements, and carriages. He makes it the\r\nduty of one of his sons to furnish her with all the \"firewood\" she may\r\nwant, with ten bushels of corn-meal, two bushels of English meal, four\r\nbushels of ground malt, four barrels of good cider,—he to find the\r\nbarrels—as many apples \"as she shall see cause,\" and nine or ten score\r\nweight of good pork, annually: he was to \"keep for her two cows, winter\r\nand summer,\" and generally to provide all \"things needful.\" The will\r\nspecifies, apartment by apartment, from cellar to garret, one-half of\r\nthe house, to be for her accommodation, use, and exclusive control, and\r\nhalf of the garden. The sons were to pay, in specified proportions, all\r\nhis funeral charges. One of the sons was to pay her forthwith four\r\npounds in money; and they were severally to deliver to her\r\nannu[i.164]ally, in proportions expressly stated, ten pounds for pocket\r\nmoney. When the relative value of money at that time is considered, and\r\nthe other particulars above named taken into account, it will be\r\nallowed that he was faithful and wise in caring for the wife of his\r\nyouth and the companion of his long life. There is no better criterion\r\nof the good sense and good feeling of a person than his last will and\r\ntestament. The result of a quite extensive examination is a conviction\r\nthat the application of this test to the early inhabitants of Salem\r\nVillage is most creditable to them, particularly in the tender but\r\njudicious and effectual manner in which the rights, comfort,\r\nindependence, and security of their wives were provided for.\r\n\r\nIn the third generation, the three Putnam families began to give their\r\nsons to the general service of the country in conspicuous public\r\nstations, and in the professional walks of life. Their names appear on\r\nthe page of history and in the catalogues of colleges. Major-General\r\nIsrael Putnam was a grandson of the first Thomas. On the 14th of May,\r\n1718, Archelaus, a grandson of John, and son of James, died at\r\nCambridge, while an undergraduate. Benjamin, a son of Nathaniel, in his\r\nwill, presented for Probate, April 25, 1715, says, \"I give my son\r\nDaniel one hundred and fifty pounds for his learning.\" Daniel lived and\r\ndied in the ministry, at North Reading. His name heads the list of more\r\nthan thirty—all, it is probable, of this family—in the last Triennial\r\nCatalogue of Harvard University.[i.165]\r\n\r\nThe brightest name in the annals of Salem Village, though frequently\r\nreferred to, has not yet been presented for your contemplation. I shall\r\nhold it up and keep it in your view by a somewhat detailed description,\r\nnot only because it is necessary to a full understanding of our\r\nsubject, but because it is good to gaze upon a life of virtue; to pause\r\nwhile beholding a portrait beaming with beneficence, and radiant with\r\nall excellent, beautiful, and attractive affections.\r\n\r\nNathaniel Ingersoll was about eleven years old at the death of his\r\nfather. His mother married John Knights, of Newbury, who became the\r\nhead of her household, and continued to carry on the Townsend Bishop\r\nfarm for several years. Governor Endicott, the friend and neighbor of\r\nRichard Ingersoll, took Nathaniel, while still a lad, into his family.\r\nIn a deposition made in Court, June 24, 1701, Nathaniel Ingersoll says,\r\n\"I went to live with Governor Endicott as his servant four years, on\r\nthe Orchard Farm.\" At that time, the term \"servant\" had no derogatory\r\nsense connected with it. It merely implied the relations between an\r\nemployer and the employed, without the least tint of the feeling which\r\nwe associate with the condition of servility. Here was a youth, who, by\r\nhis father's will, was the owner of a valuable estate of seventy-five\r\nacres in the immediate neighborhood, voluntarily seeking the privilege\r\nof entering the service of his father's friend, because he thereby\r\nwould be better qualified, when old enough, to enter upon his own\r\nestate. Governor Endicott's political duties were[i.166] not then\r\nregarded as requiring him to live in Boston; and his usual residence\r\nwas at the Orchard Farm, where he was making improvements and\r\nconducting agricultural operations upon so large a scale that it was\r\nthe best school of instruction anywhere to be found for a young person\r\nintending to make that his pursuit in life. Young John Putnam, as has\r\nbeen stated, was there for the same purpose, under similar\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nHaving built a house and barn, and provided the necessary stock and\r\nmaterials, Nathaniel Ingersoll went upon his farm when about nineteen\r\nyears of age. Soon after, probably, he married Hannah Collins of Lynn,\r\nwho, during their long lives, proved a worthy helpmeet. His house was\r\non a larger scale than was usual at that time. One of its rooms is\r\nspoken of as very large; and the uses to which his establishment was\r\nput, from time to time, prove that it must have had capacious\r\napartments. Its site is shown on the map. The road from Salem to\r\nAndover passed it, not at an angle as now, but by a curve. The present\r\nparsonage of Danvers Centre stands on the lot. But Ingersoll's house\r\nwas a little in the rear of the site occupied by the present parsonage.\r\nIt faced south. In front was an open space, or lawn, called Ingersoll's\r\nCommon. Here he lived nearly seventy years. During that long period,\r\nhis doors were ever open to hospitality and benevolence. His house was\r\nthe centre of good neighborhood and of all movements for the public\r\nwelfare. His latch-string was always out[i.167] for friend or stranger.\r\nIn a military sense, and every other sense, it was the head-quarters of\r\nthe village. On his land, a few rods to the north-east, stood the\r\nblock-house where watch was kept against Indian attacks. There a\r\nsentinel was posted day and night, under his supervision. The spot was\r\ncentral to the several farming settlements; and all meetings of every\r\nkind took place there. To accommodate the public, he was licensed to\r\nkeep a victualling-house; also to sell beer and cider by the quart \"on\r\nthe Lord's Day.\" This last provision was for the benefit of those who\r\ncame great distances to meeting, and had to find refreshment somewhere\r\nbetween the services. To meet the occasions arising out of this\r\nbusiness, he probably had a separate building. Indeed, the evidence, in\r\nthe language used in reference to it, is quite decisive that there was\r\nan \"ordinary,\" distinct from the dwelling-house. The location was\r\nthought to render such an establishment necessary, and his character\r\nsecured its orderly maintenance.\r\n\r\nTravellers through the country stopped at \"Nathaniel Ingersoll's\r\ncorner.\" The earliest path or roadway to and from the eastern\r\nsettlements went by it. Here Increase and Cotton Mather, and all\r\nmagistrates and ministers, were entertained. Here the wants of the poor\r\nand unfortunate were made known, and all men came for counsel and\r\nadvice. From the first, even when he had not reached the age of\r\nmaturity, he commanded to a singular extent the confidence and respect\r\nof all men. The influence of his bearing and character,[i.168] thus\r\nearly established, was never lost or abated, or disturbed for a moment\r\nduring his long life. He was the umpire to settle all differences, but\r\nnever made an enemy by his decisions. Although of moderate estate,\r\ncompared with some of his neighbors, they all treated him with a\r\ndeference greater than they sometimes paid to each other. It was his\r\nlot to be mixed up with innumerable controversies, to be in the very\r\ncentre of the most vehement and frightful social convulsions, and to\r\nact decisively in some of them; but it is most marvellous to witness\r\nhow uniform and universal was the consideration in which he was held.\r\nThese statements are justified abundantly by evidence in records and\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nWhen village business was to be transacted, or consultation of any kind\r\nhad, the house of Deacon Ingersoll was designated, as a matter of\r\ncourse, for the place of meeting. Whether it was an ecclesiastical or a\r\nmilitary gathering, a prayer-meeting or a train-band drill, it was\r\nthere. Before they had a meeting-house, it cannot be doubted, they met\r\nfor worship in his large room. We find it recorded, that, after the\r\nmeeting-house was built, if from the bitterness of the weather, or any\r\nother cause, it was too uncomfortable to remain in, they would adjourn\r\nto Deacon Ingersoll's. Such a free use of a particular person's\r\npremises sometimes engenders a familiarity that runs into license, and\r\nis apt to breed contempt. Not so at all in his case. There was a\r\nnative-born dignity, an honest manliness and pervading integrity[i.169]\r\nabout him, that were appreciated by all persons at all times. When\r\nwrong was meditated, his admonition was received with respectful\r\nconsideration; when it had been committed, his rebuke awakened no\r\nresentment. The fact, that he was acknowledged and felt by all to be a\r\nperfectly just man, is apparent through the whole course of his action\r\nin all the affairs of life. His uprightness, freedom from unworthy\r\nprejudice, and clear and transparent conscientiousness, appear in all\r\ndocuments, depositions, and records that proceeded from him. He was\r\noften called to give evidence in land causes and other trials at law;\r\nand his testimony is always straightforward, fair, and lucid. You can\r\ntell from the style, temper, or tone of other witnesses, which side of\r\nthe controversy they espoused, but not from his. In the great and\r\nprotracted conflict in the courts, relating to the Townsend Bishop\r\nfarm, he and all his most intimate connections and relatives were\r\nparties of adverse interest; but Zerubabel Endicott paid homage, and\r\nleft it on record, to the truthfulness and uprightness of the testimony\r\nand the fairness of the course of Nathaniel Ingersoll. We shall meet\r\nother illustrations to the same effect in the course of our narrative.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is anticipating the course of events, it may be well to\r\ntrace the outlines of the life of this man to its distant close.\r\nPartaking of the general views of his age, he participated in the\r\nproceedings that led to the witchcraft prosecutions. He believed in\r\nwhat was regarded as decisive evidence against the[i.170] accused, and\r\nacted accordingly. But no one ever felt that there was any\r\nvindictiveness in his course.\r\n\r\nHe lived to see the storm that desolated his beloved village pass away,\r\nand to enjoy the restoration of reason, peace, and good-will among a\r\npeople who had so long been torn by strife, and subjected to untold\r\nhorrors,—horrors that have never yet been fully described, and which I\r\ndespair of being able adequately to depict. He did all that a good and\r\ntrue man could do to eradicate the causes of the mischief. He\r\nparticipated in the exercises of a day of Thanksgiving, set apart for\r\nthe purpose, in 1700, to express the devout and contrite gratitude of\r\nthe people to a merciful God for deliverance from the errors and\r\npassions that had overwhelmed them with such awful judgments. The\r\nremoval of Mr. Parris having been effected, Joseph Green was settled\r\nnear the close of the year 1697. He was a wise and prudent man. By\r\nkind, cautious, and well-timed measures, he gradually succeeded in\r\nextracting every root of bitterness, healing all the breaches, and\r\nrestoring harmony to a long-distracted people. In this work, Deacon\r\nIngersoll and his good associate, Edward Putnam, aided him to the\r\nutmost. When, by their united counsels and labors, the difficult work\r\nwas about accomplished, Mr. Green was taken to his reward, in 1715.\r\nGreatly was he lamented; but Nathaniel Ingersoll had realized all his\r\nbest wishes at last. The prayers he had poured forth for fifty years\r\nhad been answered. He had seen the completed service of a pastor who\r\nhad fulfilled his[i.171] highest estimate of what a Christian minister\r\nshould be. He lived to witness and share in the warm and unanimous\r\nwelcome of Peter Clark to a useful, honored, happy ministry which\r\nlasted more than half a century. The ordination of Mr. Clark, which\r\ntook place on the 8th of June, 1717, was made the occasion of\r\ndemonstrating the complete re-establishment of social harmony and\r\nChristian love throughout that entire community. The storms of strife\r\nhad commenced with the settlement of the first minister, more than\r\nforty years before: they had increased in violence, until, at the\r\nwitchcraft delusion, they swept in a tornado every thing to ruin. The\r\nclouds had been slowly dispersed, and the angry waves smoothed down, by\r\nMr. Green's benignant ministry. The long, and yet unbroken, \"era of\r\ngood feeling\" was fully inaugurated. It was a day of great rejoicing.\r\nOld men and matrons, young men and maidens, met together in happy\r\nunion. Tradition says that they carried their grateful festivities to\r\nthe highest point allowable by the proprieties of that period. Having\r\nwitnessed this scene, and beheld the church and village of his\r\naffections start on a new and sure career of peace and prosperity, the\r\nGood Parishioner folded his mantle and departed from sight. He died in\r\n1719, in his eighty-fifth year. He was truly the \"Man of Ross.\" The\r\ncelebrated portrait, which poetry has drawn under this name, was from\r\nan actual example in real life, not more shining than his. He left no\r\nissue; but his brothers were the founders of a family[i.172] widely\r\ndiffused, many members of which have, in every subsequent age,\r\ncontributed to the honor of the name. Innumerable branches have spread\r\nout from the same stock under other names. The children of the late Dr.\r\nNathaniel Bowditch, through both father and mother, have descended from\r\na brother of Nathaniel Ingersoll.\r\n\r\nCitations and extracts from documents on file will justify all I have\r\nsaid of this man.\r\n\r\nHis wife was a spirit kindred to his own. Their only child, a daughter,\r\ndied when quite young. Their hearts demanded an object on which to\r\nexercise parental affection, and to give opportunity for benevolent\r\ncare, within their own household; and they induced their neighbor,\r\nJoseph Hutchinson, who had several sons, to give one of them to be\r\ntheirs by adoption. When this child had grown to manhood, a deed was\r\nrecorded in the Essex Registry, Oct. 2, 1691, of which this is the\r\npurport:—\r\n\r\n\"Benjamin Hutchinson, being an infant when he was given to us by his\r\nparents, we have brought him up as our own child; and he, the said\r\nBenjamin, living with us as an obedient son, until he came of one and\r\ntwenty years of age, he then marrying from us, I, the said Nathaniel\r\nIngersoll, and Hannah, my wife, on these considerations, do, upon the\r\nmarriage of our adopted son, Benjamin Hutchinson, give and bequeath to\r\nhim, his heirs and assigns for ever, this deed of gift of ten acres of\r\nupland, and also three acres of meadow,\" &c.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Parris was settled, it occurred to Deacon[i.173] Ingersoll,\r\nthat it would be very convenient for him to have a certain piece of\r\nground between the parsonage land and the Andover road; and he gave him\r\na deed, from which the following is an extract. It is dated Jan. 2,\r\n1689.\r\n\r\n\"To all Christian people to whom this present writing shall come,\r\nNathaniel Ingersoll, of Salem Village, in the county of Essex, sendeth\r\ngreeting. Know ye, that the said Nathaniel Ingersoll, husbandman, and\r\nHannah, his wife, for and in consideration of the love, respect, and\r\nhonor which they justly bear unto the public worship of the true and\r\nonly God, and therefore for the encouragement of their well-beloved\r\npastor, the Rev. Samuel Parris, who hath lately taken that office\r\namongst them, and also for and in consideration of a very small sum of\r\nmoney to them in hand paid, with which they do acknowledge themselves\r\nfully contented and satisfied, do grant to said Samuel Parris and\r\nElizabeth, his wife, for life, and then to the children of said Samuel\r\nand Elizabeth Parris, four and a half acres of land, adjoining upon the\r\nhome field of the said Nathaniel Ingersoll; the three acres on the\r\nsouth alienated by gift, and the remainder by sale.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a fine young orchard on the land.\r\n\r\nJoseph Houlton had conveyed to the parish a lot for the use of the\r\nministry, attached to the parsonage house. A question having arisen in\r\nconsequence of a lost deed, or some other imagined defect in the\r\nHoulton title, whether the land originally belonged to him or to\r\nNathaniel Ingersoll, the latter disposed of it at once by an instrument\r\nrecorded in the Essex Registry, of which the following is the\r\nsubstance:[i.174]—\r\n\r\n\"Nathaniel Ingersoll to the Trustees of Salem Village Ministry land,\r\nfor divers good causes and considerations me thereunto moving, but more\r\nespecially for the true love and desire I have to the peace and welfare\r\nof Salem Village wherein I dwell, I hereby release, &c., all my right\r\nand title to five acres described in my brother Houlton's deed of\r\nsale,\" &c.\r\n\r\nIn the same Registry, the following extract is found, in a deed dated\r\nJan. 28, 1708:—\r\n\r\n\"For the desire I have that children may be educated in Salem Village,\r\nI freely give four poles square of land to Rev. Joseph Green, to have\r\nand to hold the same, not for his own particular use, but for the\r\nsetting a schoolhouse upon, and the encouragement of a school in this\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\nThe Essex Registry has a deed dated Jan. 6, 1714, of which the\r\nfollowing is the substance:—\r\n\r\n\"For the good affection that I bear unto Deacon Edward Putnam, and the\r\ndesire that I have of his comfortable attendance upon the public\r\nworship of God, I have freely given unto him, the said Deacon Edward\r\nPutnam, of Salem aforesaid, for him and his heirs for ever, a piece of\r\nland, bounded northerly upon the land of Joseph Green, next to his\r\norchard gate, westerly on the highway, and southerly and easterly on my\r\nland.\"\r\n\r\nDeacon Putnam was, at this time, sixty years of age. His homestead was\r\nat some distance; and it was often difficult for him to get to meeting.\r\nIngersoll had always enjoyed the convenience of having only a few rods\r\nto go to the place of worship; and he desired to[i.175] have his\r\nbeloved colleague enjoy the same privilege. Besides, he longed to have\r\nhim near. The proffer was probably accepted. We find that\r\nchurch-meetings were held at the house of Deacon Putnam, which would\r\nnot probably so often have been the case, had he remained on his farm;\r\nand we know that there were two dwelling-houses, some time afterwards,\r\non the Ingersoll lot. It was a pleasant arrangement: the two deacons\r\nand the minister being thus brought close together, and reaching each\r\nother through Ingersoll's garden and the minister's orchard. Of the\r\npersonal friendship, attachment, and genial affection between the two\r\ngood old deacons, the foregoing extract is a pleasing illustration.\r\n\r\nNathaniel Ingersoll's property was never very large; and, as he had\r\nenjoyed the luxury, all his life long, of benevolence and beneficence,\r\nthere was no great amount to be left after suitably providing for his\r\nwife. But there was enough to enable him to express the family\r\naffection to which he was always true, and to give a parting assurance\r\nof his devotion to the church and people of the village. By his will,\r\ncertain legacies were required to be paid by the residuary legatee and\r\nfinal heir within a reasonable time specified in the document. It bears\r\ndate July 8, 1709, and was offered for Probate, Feb. 17, 1719. It\r\nbegins thus:—\r\n\r\n\"In the name of God, Amen. I, Nathaniel Ingersoll, of Salem, in the\r\ncounty of Essex, in the Province of Massachutetts Bay, in New England,\r\nbeing through God's mercy in good health of body and of perfect memory,\r\nbut not[i.176] knowing how soon my great change may come, do make this\r\nmy last will, in manner and form following: First, I give up my soul to\r\nGod, in and through Jesus Christ my Redeemer, when he shall please to\r\ncall for it, hoping for a glorious resurrection, in and through his\r\nmerits; and my body to decent burial, at the discretion of my\r\nexecutors; and, as for the worldly estate God hath been pleased to give\r\nme, I dispose of it in the manner following,\" &c.\r\n\r\nHe gives a small sum of money, varying from thirty shillings to four\r\npounds, to each and every nephew and niece then living, twenty-two in\r\nnumber. He provides for an annuity of twenty shillings a year for a\r\nsister, the only remaining member of his own immediate family, to be\r\npaid into the hands of the daughter who took care of her. Not being\r\nable to leave a large amount to any, he preferred to express his love\r\nfor all. There were two items in the will which may be specially\r\npreserved from oblivion.\r\n\r\n\"I give to the church in Salem Village the sum of fifty shillings in\r\nmoney, for the more adorning the Lord's Table, to be laid out in some\r\nsilver cup, at the discretion of the Pastor, Deacons, and my\r\noverseers.\"—\"After my wife's decease, I give to Benjamin (my adopted\r\nson) who was very dutiful to me, while he lived with me, and helpful to\r\nme since he has gone from me, all the remaining part of my whole\r\nestate, both real and personal,—excepting a small parcel of land of\r\nabout two acres, that lyeth between Mrs. Walcots and George Wyotts by\r\nthe highway, which I give to the inhabitants of Salem Village, for a\r\ntraining place for ever.\" [i.177]\r\n\r\nThe bonds required of the executors by the Probate Court were to the\r\namount of two hundred pounds only, showing that his movable or personal\r\nestate was a very moderate one. There is a feature in the will, which\r\nis, I think, worthy of being mentioned, as evincing the excellent\r\njudgment and practical wisdom of this man.\r\n\r\n\"I give to Hannah, my well-beloved wife, the use and improvement of my\r\nwhole estate during her natural life: and my will is, that, if my wife\r\nshould marry again, he that she so marrieth, before she marry, shall\r\ngive sufficient security to my overseers not to make strip or waste\r\nupon any of my estate; and, if he do not become so bound, I give\r\none-half of my whole estate to Benjamin Hutchinson, at the time of my\r\nwife's marriage.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not cut her off entirely, as is sometimes attempted to be done,\r\nin the event of a second marriage, but secured her and the estate\r\nagainst suffering in case she took that step. He adopted an effectual\r\nmethod to prevent any one from seeking to marry her for the purpose of\r\ngetting the benefit of her whole income and a comfortable establishment\r\nupon his property without providing for its preservation; and, if she\r\nshould be so improvident as to marry again without having his\r\nconditions complied with, he took care that she should not thereby\r\nexpose to injury or loss more than one-half of his estate. Ingenuity is\r\nmuch exercised in making wills, particularly in reference to the\r\nrights, interests, and security of wives. It is worthy of\r\nconsideration, whether, all things considered, Nathaniel[i.178]\r\nIngersoll's plan is not about as skilful and just as any that has been\r\ndevised.\r\n\r\nWe shall meet this man again in the course of our story. I trust to\r\nyour good feeling in vindication of the space I have given to his\r\nbiography; being strongly impressed with a conviction, that you will\r\nagree with me,—taking into view the influence he constantly exerted,\r\nhis steadfast integrity and honor, his personal dignity and public\r\nspirit,—that the life of this citizen of a retired rural community,\r\nthis plain \"husbandman,\" is itself a monument to his memory more truly\r\nglorious than many which have been reared to perpetuate the names of\r\nmen whom the world has called great. The \"training place\" has been\r\ncarefully preserved. Occupying a central point, by the side of the\r\nprincipal street, this pretty lawn is a fitting memorial of the Father\r\nof the village. In its proper character, as a training-field, it is\r\ninvested with an interest not elsewhere surpassed, if equalled. Within\r\nits enclosure the elements of the military art have been imparted to a\r\ngreater number of persons distinguished in their day, and who have left\r\nan imperishable glory behind them as the defenders of the country, a\r\nbrave yeomanry in arms, than on any other spot. It was probably used as\r\na training field at the first settlement of the village. From the\r\nslaughter of Bloody Brook, the storming of the Narragansett Fort, and\r\nall the early Indian wars; from the Heights of Abraham, Lake George,\r\nLexington, Bunker Hill, Brandywine, Pea Ridge, and a hundred other\r\nbattle-fields, a lustre[i.179] is reflected back upon this village\r\nparade-ground. It is associated with all the military traditions of the\r\ncountry, down to the late Rebellion. Lothrop, Davenport, Gardners,\r\nDodges, Raymonds, Putnams, Porters, Hutchinsons, Herricks, Flints, and\r\nothers, who here taught or learned the manual and drill, are names\r\ninscribed on the rolls of history for deeds of heroism and prowess.\r\n\r\nThere was the usual diversity and variety of character among the people\r\nof the village. John Procter originally lived in Ipswich, where he, as\r\nwell as his father before him, had a farm of considerable value. In\r\n1666, or about that time, he removed to Salem, and carried on the\r\nDowning farm, which had before been leased to the Flints. After a\r\nwhile, Procter purchased a part of it. If a conclusion can be drawn\r\nfrom the prevalent type of his posterity of our day, he was a man of\r\nherculean frame. There is, I think, a tradition to this effect. At any\r\nrate, his character was of that stamp. He had great native force and\r\nenergy. He was bold in his spirit and in his language,—an upright man,\r\nno doubt, as the whole tone of the memorials of him indicate, but free\r\nand imprudent in speech, impulsive in feeling, and sometimes rash in\r\naction. He was liable from this cause, as we shall see, to get into\r\ncontention and give offence. There was Jeremiah Watts, a representative\r\nof a class of men existing in every community where the intellect is\r\nstimulated and idiosyncrasies allowed to develop themselves. By\r\noccupation he was a dish-turner, but by temperament an\r\nenthu[i.180]siast, a zealot, and an agitator. He was not satisfied with\r\nthings as they were, nor willing to give time an opportunity to improve\r\nthem. He took hold of the horns of the altar with daring hands. He\r\ndenounced the Church and the world,—undertook to overturn every thing,\r\nand to put all on a new foundation. He entered on a crusade against\r\nwhat he called \"pulpit preaching,\" whereby particular persons, called\r\nministers, \"may deliver what they please, and none must object; and\r\nthis we must pay largely for; our bread must be taken out of our\r\nmouths, to maintain the beast's mark; and be wholly deprived of our\r\nChristian privileges. This is the time of Antichrist's reign, and he\r\nmust reign this time: now are the witnesses slain, and the leaders in\r\nchurches are these slayers. But I see plainly that it is a vain thing\r\nto debate about these things with our fellow-brethren; for they are all\r\nfor lording it, and trampling under foot.\" This man imagined that he\r\n\"was singled out alone to give his testimony for Christ, discovering\r\nAntichrist's marks.\" \"If any,\" he cried out, \"will be faithful for\r\nChrist, they must witness against Antichrist, which is self-love, and\r\nlovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. The witnesses are now\r\nslain, but shortly they will rise again,\" &c. He tried to get up\r\n\"private Christian meetings,\" to run an opposition to \"pulpit\r\npreaching.\" After going about from house to house, declaiming in this\r\nstyle, denouncing all who would not fall in with his notions and act\r\nwith him, and not succeeding in overthrowing things in general, he hit\r\nupon a new ex[i.181]pedient. As his neighbors had wit enough to let him\r\nalone, and did not suffer themselves to be tempted to resort to the\r\ncivil power to make him keep quiet, he did it himself. He instituted\r\nproceedings against the ministers and churches, on the charge, that, by\r\ntaking the rule into their own hands, they were supplanting the\r\nmagistrates and usurping the civil power. This was not in itself a bad\r\nmove; but the Court wisely declined to engage in the proceedings. They\r\nneither prosecuted the case nor him, but let the whole go by. They\r\nadhered severely to the do-nothing policy. What a world of mischief\r\nwould have been avoided, if all courts, everywhere, at all times, had\r\nshown an equal wisdom! Watts was allowed to vex the village, torment\r\nthe minister, and perplex those who listened to him by the ingenuity\r\nand ability with which he urged his views. He continued his brawling\r\ndeclamations until he was tired; but, not being noticed by ministers or\r\nmagistrates, no great harm was done, and he probably subsided into a\r\nquiet and respectable citizen.\r\n\r\nThe prominent place Giles Corey is to occupy in the scene before us\r\nrenders an account of him particularly necessary. It is not easy to\r\ndescribe him. He was a very singular person. His manner of life and\r\ngeneral bearing and conversation were so disregardful, in many\r\nparticulars, of the conventional proprieties of his day, that it is not\r\nsafe to receive implicitly the statements made by his contemporaries.\r\nBy his peculiarities of some sort, he got a bad name. In the Book of\r\nRecords of the First Church in Salem, where[i.182] his public\r\nprofession of religion is recorded, he is spoken of as a man of eighty\r\nyears of age, and of a \"scandalous life,\" but who made a confession of\r\nhis sins satisfactory to that body. It cannot be denied that he was\r\nregarded in this light by some; but there is no reason to believe,\r\nthat, in referring to the sinfulness of his past life, the old man\r\nmeant more than was usually understood by such language on such\r\noccasions. He was often charged with criminal acts; but in every\r\ninstance the charge was proved to be either wholly unfounded or greatly\r\nexaggerated. He had a good many contentions and rough passages; but\r\nthey were the natural consequences, when a bold and strong man was put\r\nupon the defensive, or drawn to the offensive, by the habit of\r\ninconsiderate aspersion into which some of his neighbors had been led,\r\nand the bad repute put upon him by scandal-mongers. He was evidently an\r\nindustrious, hard-working man. He was a person of some means, a holder\r\nof considerable property in lands and other forms. Deeds are often\r\nfound on record from and to him. He owned meadows near Ipswich River.\r\nHis homestead, during the last thirty years of his life, was a farm of\r\nmore than a hundred acres of very valuable land, which has been in the\r\npossession of the family, now owning it, for a hundred years. The\r\npresent proprietor, Mr. Benjamin Taylor, some twenty years ago,\r\nploughed up the site of Corey's dwelling-house; the vestiges of the\r\ncellar being then quite visible. It was near the crossing of the Salem\r\nand Lowell, and Georgetown and Boston Railroads,[i.183] about three\r\nhundred feet to the west of the crossing, and close to the track of the\r\nformer road, on its south side. The spot is surrounded by beautiful\r\nfields; and their aspect shows that it must have been, in all respects,\r\nan eligible estate. What is now known as \"the Curtis Field\" is a part\r\nof Corey's farm.\r\n\r\nGiles Corey lived previously, for some time, in the town of Salem. He\r\nsold his house there in 1659. The contract with a carpenter for\r\nbuilding his farmhouse is preserved. It was stipulated to be erected\r\n\"where he shall appoint.\" While the carpenter was getting out the\r\nmaterials, he selected and bought the farm, on which he lived ever\r\nafterwards. The house was to be \"twenty feet in length, fifteen in\r\nbreadth, and eight feet stud.\" Nothing strikes us more, as strange and\r\nunaccountable, than the small size of houses in those days. One would\r\nhave thought, that, where wood was so plenty and near at hand, and land\r\nof no account, they would have built larger houses. In a letter, dated\r\nNov. 16, 1646, from Governor Winthrop to his son John, of Connecticut,\r\nhe gives an account \"of a tempest (than which I never observed a\r\ngreater);\" and mentions that the roof of \"Lady Moody's house, at\r\nSalem,\" with all of the chimney above it, was blown off in two parts,\r\nand \"carried six or eight rods. Ten persons lay under it, and knew not\r\nof it till they arose in the morning.\" The house had a flat roof, was\r\nof one story, and nine feet in height! Lady Deborah Moody was a person\r\nof high position, a connection of Sir Henry Vane, and a[i.184] woman of\r\nproperty. She bought Mr. Humphreys' great plantation. But, like\r\nTownsend Bishop, she was dealt with, and compelled to quit the colony,\r\non account of her doubts about infant baptism. Winthrop calls her a\r\n\"wise and anciently religious woman.\" She went to Long Island, where\r\nher influence was so important, that Governor Stuyvesant consulted her\r\nin his administration, and conceded to her the nomination of\r\nmagistrates. It seems very strange that such a lady should have had a\r\nhouse only nine feet high. The early houses were built either as\r\ntemporary structures or with a view to enlargement. Perhaps Lady Moody\r\nintended to add a story to hers. They were low-studded for warmth. The\r\nfarm-houses generally were designed to be increased in length, when\r\nconvenience required. The chimney was very large, placed at one end,\r\nand so constructed, that, on the extension of the building, fire-places\r\ncould be opened into it on the new end. A building of twenty feet was\r\nprepared to become one of forty feet in width or length, as the case\r\nmight be; and then the chimney would be in the middle of it.\r\n\r\nAs has been intimated, Corey was in bad repute. Either he was a lawless\r\nman, or much misunderstood. I am inclined to the latter opinion. He\r\nbelonged to that class of persons, instances of which we occasionally\r\nmeet, who care little about the opinions or the talk of others. On one\r\noccasion, he was going into town with a cartload of wood. He met\r\nAnthony Needham, in company with John Procter whose house[i.185] he had\r\njust passed. Procter accosted him thus: \"How now, Giles, wilt thou\r\nnever leave thy old trade? Thou hast got some of my wood here upon thy\r\ncart.\" Corey answered, \"True, I did take two or three sticks to lay\r\nbehind the cart to ease the oxen, because they bore too hard.\" This\r\nshows the free way in which Procter bantered with Corey, and the slight\r\naccount the latter made of it. But the thing before long got to be too\r\nserious to be trifled with. It became the fashion to charge all sorts\r\nof offences against Corey; and, whatever any one lost or mislaid, he\r\nwas considered as having abstracted it. The gossip against him was\r\nquite unrestrained, and created a bitter and angry feeling in the\r\nneighborhood. In the winter of 1676, a man named Goodell, who had been\r\nworking on Corey's farm, was carried home to his friends by Corey's\r\nwife, in a feeble state of health, and died soon after. It was\r\nwhispered about, and before long openly asserted, that he had come to\r\nhis death in consequence of having been violently beaten by Corey, who\r\nwas accordingly arrested and brought to trial for killing the man.\r\nThere was a great excitement against him. He probably had punished the\r\nman severely for some alleged misconduct; and it was charged that the\r\ncastigation had been so unmerciful and excessive as to have broken down\r\nhis constitution and caused his death. There was conflicting evidence\r\ngoing to show that the man had been beaten, for some misconduct, after\r\nhe had returned to his family. It was a circumstance in favor of Corey,\r\nthat his wife[i.186] had taken the invalid to his home; and there was\r\nno evidence of any ill feeling between her and the sick man during a\r\nstop they made at Procter's house on their way. The death, too, it was\r\nsupposed by some, might have resulted from ordinary disease, and not\r\nfrom whipping, either at Corey's or at home. The result was, that,\r\nnotwithstanding the prejudice against Corey, he was discharged on\r\npaying a fine; showing that the Court did not consider it a very\r\nserious offence. We shall hear of this affair again.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1678, there was a suit at law between Corey and a man named\r\nJohn Gloyd, a laborer on his farm, on a question of wages. The case\r\nwas, by agreement of the parties, passed out of court into the hands of\r\narbitrators mutually chosen. John Procter was one of the arbitrators,\r\nand, as it would seem, chosen as the friend of Gloyd: Nathaniel Putnam\r\nand Edmund Bridges were the others; one of them chosen by Corey, and\r\nthe other mutually agreed upon. They brought in their award. Its\r\nprecise character is not stated; but the circumstances indicate that it\r\nwas favorable to Gloyd. The conduct of Corey on this occasion shows,\r\nthat, though a rough man perhaps, and liable, from his peculiar ways,\r\nto be harshly spoken of, he had, after all, a generous, forgiving, and\r\ngenial nature. Nathaniel Putnam and Edmund Bridges state, that, when\r\nthey brought in their award, \"it was greatly to the satisfaction of the\r\nparties concerned; and Giles Corey did manifest as much satisfaction,\r\nand gave as many thanks to every one of us, as[i.187] ever we heard;\r\nand Goodman Corey did manifest, to our observation, as much\r\nsatisfaction to John Procter as he did to the rest of the arbitrators.\"\r\nCaptain Moore, being by when the award was brought in, says, \"I did see\r\nand take notice of the abundance of love manifested from Corey to\r\nProcter, and from Procter to Corey: for they drank wine together; and\r\nProcter paid for part, and Corey for part.\"\r\n\r\nThis remarkable overflow of affection between these two men is rendered\r\ninteresting, not merely by the collisions into which, before and after,\r\ntheir impulsive and imprudent natures brought them, but by the part\r\nthey were destined to enact in an impending tragedy, which was to bring\r\nthem to a fearful end in a manner and on a scene that will arrest the\r\nnotice of all ages, and attest to their strong characters and heroic\r\nspirit. The passage has a unique interest, and is worthy of a painter.\r\n\r\nIt happened unfortunately, that, a few days after the loving embraces\r\nof these hardy men, Procter's house took fire. According to their\r\nhabit, some of the neighbors at once started the idea, that Corey had\r\nset fire to it because of the award of the arbitrators, of whom Procter\r\nwas one. Under the excitement of the conflagration, with his usual\r\nrashness, and forgetting the pledges of reconciliation that had just\r\npassed between them, Procter fell in with the accusation, and Corey was\r\nbrought to trial. It appeared, in evidence, that John Phelps and Thomas\r\nFuller, who lived on the western borders of the village, near\r\nIpswich[i.188] River, coming along the road towards Procter's Corner\r\nabout two hours before daylight, on the way probably to Salem market,\r\nsaw his roof on fire, gave the alarm, and stopped to help put it out.\r\nThomas Gould and Thomas Flint thought it must be the work of an\r\nincendiary, or of \"an evil hand,\" as they expressed it, from the place\r\nwhere it took and the hour when it occurred. On the other hand, it was\r\ntestified by James Poland and Caleb and Jane Moore, that they heard\r\nJohn Procter say that his boy carried a lamp and set the fire by\r\naccident. This was said by him, probably before the idea of Corey's\r\nagency in the matter had been put into his head. The prisoner proved an\r\n_alibi_ by the most conclusive evidence, which is so curious, as giving\r\nan insight of a farmer's life at that time, and of Corey's domestic\r\ncondition, that it may well be inserted.\r\n\r\nAbraham Walcot testifies, that, \"Tuesday night last was a week, I\r\nlodged at Giles Corey's house, which night John Procter's house was\r\ndamaged by fire; and Giles Corey went to bed before nine o'clock, and\r\nrose about sunrise again, and could not have gone out of the house but\r\nI should have heard him; and it must have been impossible that he\r\nshould have gone to Procter's house that night; for he cannot in a long\r\ntime go afoot, and, for his horse-kind, they were all in the woods. And\r\nfurther testifieth, that said Corey came home very weary from work, and\r\nwent to bed the rather.\" His wife testified that he was in bed from\r\nnine o'clock until sunrise.[i.189]\r\n\r\nJohn Parker, one of Corey's four sons-in-law, testified as follows: \"I\r\nbeing at work with my father, Goodman Corey, the day Goodman Procter's\r\nhouse was on fire. I going home with my father the night before, he\r\ncomplained that he was very weary, and said he would go to bed. I did,\r\non our way going, ask him whether or no he would eat his supper: my\r\nfather answered me again, no, he could not eat any thing that night;\r\nand so went to bed, and so I left him abed. And, the next morning, my\r\nfather came to me about sun-rising, and asked me to go with Abraham\r\nWalcot to fetch a load of hay; and my father said he would try whether\r\nor not he could cart up a load of peas. I do also testify that he had\r\nno horse-kind near at home at that time.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Gloyd, the hired man, with whom he had the lawsuit that had been\r\nsettled a day or two before by arbitrators, testified, in corroboration\r\nof Parker, and to show that the latter could not have had any thing to\r\ndo with the fire, that he slept in the same room with said Parker that\r\nnight, and that he came to bed between nine and ten o'clock in the\r\nevening, and never rose until the break of day. Gloyd's wife testified\r\nto the same effect. There turned out to be no evidence against Corey\r\nwhatever, but abundant proof of his innocence. The hard-working,\r\n\"weary\" old man was triumphantly acquitted. He thought, however, from\r\nthis high-handed and utterly groundless attempt to wrong and ruin him,\r\nand from calumnious general statements that had been made against him\r\nin the[i.190] course of the trial, that it was time to put a stop to\r\nthe malignant and mischievous slanders which had been current in the\r\nneighborhood. He instituted prosecutions of Procter and others for\r\ndefamation, and recovered against them all. After this, we hear no more\r\nof him until he experienced religion and was received into the First\r\nChurch. Whether he and Procter became reconciled again is not known.\r\nProbably they did; for they seem to have had points of attraction, and\r\neach of them traits of kind-heartedness and generosity, under a rather\r\nrough exterior. The manner in which they bore themselves in their last\r\nhours is a matter of history, and stamps them both with true manliness.\r\n\r\nThe incidents which have now been related, and the peculiar traits of\r\nthis man, are perhaps sufficient to account for the fact, that he was\r\nspoken of as a person of \"a scandalous\" life. He had afforded food for\r\nscandal; and it is not surprising, that, in a rural community, where\r\nbut few topics for talk occur beyond the village boundaries, all should\r\nhave participated, more or less, in criticising his ways, and that the\r\nvarious difficulties into which he had been drawn, and the charges\r\nagainst him, should have made him the object of much prejudice. His\r\nwife Martha was also a noticeable character. She was a professor of\r\nreligion, a member of the village church, and found her chief happiness\r\nin attendance upon public worship and in private devotions. Much of her\r\ntime—indeed, all that she could rescue from the labors of the\r\nhousehold[i.191]—was spent in prayer. She was a woman of spirit and\r\npluck, as we shall see.\r\n\r\nAnother notability of the village was Bridget Bishop. In 1666—then the\r\nwidow Wasselbe—she was married to Thomas Oliver. After his death, she\r\nbecame the wife of Edward Bishop, who is spoken of as a \"sawyer.\" This\r\nterm did not describe the same occupation then to which it is almost\r\nwholly applied now. Firewood, in those days, was not, as a general\r\nthing, sawed, but chopped. The sawyer got out boards and joists, beams,\r\nand timber of all kinds, from logs; and before mills were constructed,\r\nor where they were not conveniently accessible, it was an indispensable\r\nemployment, and held a high rank among the departments of useful\r\nindustry. It was in constant requisition in shipyards. It was a manly\r\nform of labor, requiring a considerable outlay of apparatus, and\r\ndeveloping finely the whole muscular organization. The implement\r\nemployed, beside the ordinary tools, such as wedges, beetles, the\r\nbroad-axe, chains, and crowbar, was a strong steel cutting-plate, of\r\ngreat breadth, with large teeth, highly polished and thoroughly\r\nwrought, some eight or ten feet in length, with a double handle,\r\ncrossing the plate at each end at a right angle. It was worked by two\r\nmen, and called a \"pit-saw,\" because sometimes the man at the lower\r\nhandle stood in a deep pit, dug for the purpose, and called a\r\n\"saw-pit.\" But, among the early settlers, the usual method was to make\r\na frame of strong timbers. The log to be sawed was raised by slings, or\r\nslid up an inclined plane, and[i.192] placed upon cross-beams. Above\r\nit, a scaffolding was made on which one man stood; the other stood on\r\nthe ground below. They each held the saw by both hands, and worked in\r\nunison. The log was pushed along by handspikes as they reached the\r\ncross-timbers, and wedges were used to keep the cleft open, that the\r\nsaw might work free. So important was this business considered, that,\r\nfrom time to time, the General Court regulated by law the rates of pay\r\nto the sawyer. If a farmer had suitable woodlands, he provided in many\r\ncases a saw-frame or saw-pit of his own, got out his logs, and worked\r\nthem into boards or square timber for sale. This was a profitable\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nEdward Bishop had resided, for some seven years previous to the\r\nwitchcraft delusion, within the limits of Salem, near the Beverly line.\r\nHis wife Bridget was a singular character, not easily described. She\r\nkept a house of refreshment for travellers, and a shovel-board for the\r\nentertainment of her guests, and generally seems to have countenanced\r\namusements and gayeties to an extent that exposed her to some scandal.\r\nShe is described as wearing \"a black cap and a black hat, and a red\r\nparagon bodice,\" bordered and looped with different colors. This would\r\nappear to have been rather a showy costume for the times. Her freedom\r\nfrom the austerity of Puritan manners, and disregard of conventional\r\ndecorum in her conversation and conduct, brought her into disrepute;\r\nand the tongue of gossip was generally loosened against her. She was\r\ncharged with witchcraft, and actually[i.193] brought to trial on the\r\ncharge, in 1680, but was acquitted; the popular mind not being quite\r\nripe for such proceedings as took place twelve years afterwards. She\r\nstill continued to brave public sentiment, lived on in the same free\r\nand easy style, paying no regard to the scowls of the sanctimonious or\r\nthe foolish tittle-tattle of the superstitious. She kept her house of\r\nentertainment, shovel-board, and other appurtenances. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, she resented the calumnies circulated about her being a witch,\r\nin a manner that made it to be felt that it was best to let her alone.\r\nA man called one day at the house of Samuel Shattuck, where there was a\r\nsick child. He was a stranger to the inmates of the family, and\r\nevidently had come to the place to make trouble for Bridget Bishop. He\r\npretended great pity for the child, and said, among other things, in an\r\noracular way, \"We are all born, some to one thing, and some to\r\nanother.\" The mother asked him what he thought her poor, suffering\r\nchild was born to. He replied, \"He is born to be bewitched, and is\r\nbewitched: you have a neighbor, that lives not far off, who is a\r\nwitch.\" The good woman does not appear to have entertained any\r\nsuspicion of the kind; but the man insisted on the truth of what he had\r\naffirmed. He succeeded in exciting her feelings on the subject, and, by\r\nvague insinuations and general descriptions of the witch, led her mind\r\nto fix upon Bridget Bishop. He said he should go and see her, and that\r\nhe could bring her out as the afflicter of her child. She consented to\r\nlet another[i.194] of her boys go with him, and show the way. They\r\nproceeded to the house, and knocked at the door. Bridget opened it, and\r\nasked what he would have: he said a pot of cider. There was something\r\nin the manner of the man which satisfied her that he had come with\r\nmischievous intent. She ordered him off, seized a spade that happened\r\nto be near, drove him out of her porch, and chased him from her\r\npremises. When he and the boy got back, they bore marks of the bad luck\r\nof the adventure. Such things had perhaps happened before, and it was\r\nfound that whoever provoked her resentment was very likely to come off\r\nsecond best from the encounter; yet Bridget was a member of Mr. Hale's\r\nChurch in Beverly, and retained her standing in full fellowship there.\r\nIt must have been thought, by the pastor and members of that church,\r\nthat no charge seriously affecting her moral or Christian character was\r\njustly imputable to her.\r\n\r\nThe traveller of to-day, in passing over Crane-river Bridge,\r\napproaching the present village of \"The Plains,\" near the eastern end\r\nof the Townsend Bishop or Nurse farm, will notice a roadway by the side\r\nof the bridge descending through the brook and going up to rejoin the\r\nmain road on the other side. Such turnouts are frequent by the side of\r\nbridges over small streams. They are refreshing and useful, cooling the\r\nfeet and cleansing the fetlocks of horses, and washing the wheels of\r\ncarriages. One afternoon, Edward Bishop, with his wife behind him on a\r\npillion, was riding home from Salem. Two women, mounted in[i.195] the\r\nsame way, joined them; and they chatted together pleasantly as their\r\nhorses ambled along. When they came to the bridge, Bishop, probably\r\nmerely for the fun of the thing, dashed down into the brook, instead of\r\ngoing over the bridge, to the great consternation and against the\r\nvehement remonstrances of his wife, who berated him soundly for his\r\nreckless disregard of her safety. They got through without accident;\r\nand the four jogged on together until the Bishops turned up to their\r\nhouse, and the other two kept on to their home in Beverly. But all the\r\nway from the bridge, until they parted company, Bishop was finding\r\ngreat fault with his wife, saying that he should not have been sorry if\r\nany mishap had occurred. She did not say much after her first fright\r\nand resentment were over; but he kept on talking very freely about her,\r\nand using some pretty hard language. This affair, which perhaps is not\r\nwithout a parallel in the occasional experiences of married life, was,\r\nwith other things of an equally trivial and irrelevant character,\r\nbrought to bear fatally against her at her trial on the charge of\r\nwitchcraft, between seven and eight years afterward.\r\n\r\nI can find no evidence against the moral character of this woman. One\r\nperson, at least, who participated largely in getting up accusations\r\nagainst her, acknowledged, in a death-bed repentance, the wrong she had\r\ndone. Mr. Hale, the minister of the Beverly congregation, states, in a\r\ndeposition, that a certain woman, \"being in full communion in our\r\nchurch, came to me to desire that Goodwife Bishop, her neighbor, wife\r\nof[i.196] Edward Bishop, Jr., might not be permitted to receive the\r\nLord's Supper in our church till she had given her satisfaction for\r\nsome offences that were against her; namely, because the said Bishop\r\ndid entertain people in her house at unseasonable hours in the night,\r\nto keep drinking and playing at shovel-board, whereby discord did arise\r\nin other families, and young people were in danger to be corrupted;\r\nthat she knew these things, and had once gone into the house, and,\r\nfinding some at shovel-board, had taken the pieces they played with and\r\nthrown them into the fire, and had reproved the said Bishop for\r\npromoting such disorders, but received no satisfaction from her about\r\nit.\" According to Mr. Hale's statement, the night after this complaint\r\nwas brought to him, the woman was found to be distracted. \"She\r\ncontinuing some time distracted, we sought the Lord by fasting and\r\nprayer.\" After a while, the woman recovered her senses, and, as Mr.\r\nHale says he understood, expressed a suspicion \"that she had been\r\nbewitched by Bishop's wife.\" He declares that he did not, at the time,\r\ncountenance the idea, \"hoping better of Goody Bishop.\" He says further,\r\nthat he \"inquired of Margaret King, who kept at or near the house,\"\r\nwhat she had observed concerning the woman who had been distracted.\r\n\"She told me that she was much given to reading and searching the\r\nprophecies of Scripture.\" At length the woman appeared to have entirely\r\nrecovered, went to Goody Bishop, gave satisfaction for what she had\r\nsaid and done against her, and they became[i.197] friends again. Mr.\r\nHale goes on to say, \"I was oft praying with and counselling of her\r\nbefore her death.\" She earnestly desired that \"Edward Bishop might be\r\nsent for, that she might make friends with him. I asked her if she had\r\nwronged Edward Bishop. She said, not that she knew of, unless it were\r\nin taking his shovel-board pieces, when people were at play with them,\r\nand throwing them into the fire; and, if she did evil in it, she was\r\nvery sorry for it, and desired he would be friends with her, or forgive\r\nher. This was the very day before she died.\" That night her distemper\r\nreturned, and, in a paroxysm of insanity, she destroyed herself.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from his own account, that Mr. Hale did not then fall in\r\nwith, or countenance at all, any unfavorable impressions against\r\nBridget Bishop; and that the poor diseased woman, when entirely free\r\nfrom her malady, repented bitterly of what she had done and said of\r\nGoodman Bishop and his wife, and heartily desired their forgiveness. So\r\nfar as the facts stated by Mr. Hale of his own knowledge go, they prove\r\nthat Bridget Bishop was the victim of gross misrepresentation. Five\r\nyears afterwards, as we shall see, Mr. Hale gave a very different\r\nversion of the affair, and one which it is extremely difficult to\r\nreconcile with his own former deliberate convictions at the time when\r\nthe circumstances occurred.\r\n\r\nAs it is my object to bring before you every thing that may help to\r\nexplain the particular occurrences embraced in the account I am to give\r\nof the witchcraft[i.198] prosecutions, two other persons must be\r\nmentioned before concluding this branch of my subject,—George Jacobs,\r\nSr., and his son George Jacobs, Jr. They each had given offence to some\r\npersons, and suffered that sort of notoriety which led to the selection\r\nof victims, although both were persons of respectability. The father\r\nowned and had lived for about a half-century on a farm in North Fields,\r\non the banks of Endicott River, a little to the eastward of the bridge\r\nat the iron-foundery. He was a person of good estate and an estimable\r\nman; but it was his misfortune to have an impulsive nature and quick\r\npassions. In June, 1677, he was prosecuted and fined for striking a man\r\nwho had incensed him. George Jacobs, Jr., his only son, at a court held\r\nNov. 7, 1674, was prosecuted, \"found blamable, and ordered to pay costs\r\nof court.\" His offence and defence are embraced in his deposition on\r\nthe occasion.\r\n\r\n\"George Jacobs's Answer to Nathaniel Putnam's Complaint.—That I did\r\nfollow some horses in our enclosure on the Royal Side, where they were\r\ntrespassing upon us; that the end of my following them was to take\r\nthem; but, rather than they would be taken, they took the water, and I\r\ndid follow them no further; but straightway they turned ashore, and I\r\ndid run to take them as they came out of the water, but could not: and\r\nI can truly take my oath that since that time I did never follow any\r\nhorses or mares; and I hope my own oath will clear me.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of his attempt to drive off the horses was, that several\r\nvaluable animals were drowned.[i.199] Their owner, Nathaniel Putnam,\r\nbrought an action; but he could not recover damages. The horses were\r\nevidently trespassing, and the Court did not seem to regard Jacobs's\r\nconduct as a heinous matter. It is not to be supposed, that Nathaniel\r\nPutnam harbored sentiments of revenge or resentment for eighteen years,\r\nor had any hand in prosecuting Jacobs in 1692. There is every\r\nindication that he did not sympathize in the violent passions which\r\nraged on that occasion, although he was much under the power of the\r\ndelusion. But the affair of drowning the horses was probably for a long\r\ntime a topic of gossip, and may have given to the author of the\r\ncatastrophe a notoriety which nearly cost him his life.\r\n\r\nThe account that has been given of the elements of the population of\r\nthe Salem Farms or Village, shows that, while there were the usual\r\nvarieties entering into the composition of all communities, it is\r\nwholly inadmissible to suppose that the witchcraft delusion took place\r\nthere because it was the scene of greater ignorance or stupidity or\r\nbarbarism than prevailed elsewhere. This will be made more apparent\r\nstill by some general views of the state of society and manners. The\r\npeople of a remote age are in general only regarded as they are seen\r\nthrough prominent occurrences and public movements. These constitute\r\nthe ordinary materials of history. Dynasties, reigns of kings, armies,\r\nlegislative proceedings, large ecclesiastical synods, dogmatic creeds,\r\nand the like, are, as a general thing, about all we know of the past.\r\nPor[i.200]traits of individuals appear here and there; but, separated\r\nfrom the ordinary life of the times, they cannot be fairly or fully\r\nappreciated. The public life of the past is but the outline, or, more\r\nstrictly speaking, the mere skeleton, of humanity. To fill up the\r\noutline, to clothe the skeleton with elastic nerves and warm flesh, and\r\nquicken it with a vital circulation, we must get at the domestic,\r\nsocial, familiar, and ordinary experience of individuals and private\r\npersons; we must obtain a view of the popular customs and the daily\r\nroutine of life. In this way only can history fulfil its office in\r\nmaking the past present.\r\n\r\nThe people of the early colonial settlements had a private and interior\r\nlife, as much as we have now, and the people of all ages and countries\r\nhave had. It is common to regard them in no other light than as a\r\nsevere, sombre, and pleasure-abhorring generation. It was not so with\r\nthem altogether. They had the same nature that we have. It was not all\r\ngloom and severity. They had their recreations, amusements, gayeties,\r\nand frolics. Youth was as buoyant with hope and gladness, love as warm\r\nand tender, mirth as natural to innocence, wit as sprightly, then as\r\nnow. There was as much poetry and romance: the merry laugh enlivened\r\nthe newly opened fields, and rang through the bordering woods as loud,\r\njocund, and unrestrained as in these older and more crowded\r\nsettlements. It is true that their theology was austere, and their\r\npolity, in Church and State, stern; but, in their modes of life, there\r\nwere some features which[i.201] gave peculiar opportunity to exercise\r\nand gratify a love of social excitement of a pleasurable kind. Let me\r\nmention some of the customs having a tendency in this direction, that\r\nprevailed in the early settlements of New England.\r\n\r\nWhenever a young man had made his clearing in the forest, got out the\r\nframe of his house, and selected a helpmeet to dwell with him in it,\r\nthere was \"a raising.\" On an appointed day, the neighbors far and near\r\nassembled; all together put their shoulders to the work; and, before\r\nthe shadows of night enveloped the scene, the house was up, and covered\r\nfrom sill to ridgepole. The same was done if the house of a neighbor\r\nhad been destroyed by fire. In this case, often the timbers, joists,\r\nand boards were contributed as well as the labor. These were made the\r\noccasions of general merriment, in which all ages and both sexes\r\nparticipated. Then there were the \"huskings.\" After the barns were\r\nfilled with hay and grain, and the corn was ripe, at \"harvest home,\"\r\ngatherings would be seen on the bright autumnal afternoons of\r\nsuccessive days, in the neighborhood of the different farmhouses. The\r\nsheaves would be taken from the shocks and brought up from the fields,\r\nthe golden leaves and milky tassels stripped from the full ear, and the\r\ncrib filled to the brim. These were scenes of unalloyed enjoyment and\r\nunrestrained gayety.\r\n\r\nAt that time were prevalent, in rural neighborhoods, other recreations\r\npromotive of social hilarity to the[i.202] highest degree. As a wintry\r\nevening drew on, the wide, deep fireplace—equalling in width nearly the\r\nwhole of one side of the room, and so deep that benches were\r\npermanently attached to the jambs, on which two or more could\r\ncomfortably sit—was duly prepared. A huge log, of a diameter equal to\r\nthat of \"the mast of some great admiral,\" six feet perhaps in length,\r\nwas worked in by handspikes to its place as the \"back-log;\" a smaller\r\none, as \"back-stick,\" placed over it; the great andirons duly adjusted,\r\nand the wood piled on artistically—for there was an art in building a\r\nwood-fire. The kindlings were placed on top of the whole; never by an\r\nexperienced hand below. More than the light of day, from dazzling\r\nchandeliers or the magic tongues of flaming gas-burners, blazes through\r\nthe halls of modern luxury and splendor; but the lights and shadows\r\nfrom a glowing, old-fashioned, New-England country fireplace created a\r\nscene as enlivening, exhilarating, and genial as has ever been\r\nwitnessed, and cannot be surpassed. Assembled neighbors in a single\r\nevening accomplished what would have been the work of a family for\r\nmonths. The corn and the nuts were all shelled; the young birch was\r\nstripped down in thin strands, and brooms enough made for a year's\r\nservice in house and barn; and various other useful offices rendered.\r\nThe sound of busy hands and nimble fingers was lost in commingling\r\nhappy voices. Fun and jest, joy and love, ruled the hour. The whole\r\naffair was followed by \"Blind-man's Buff\" or some[i.203] other sport.\r\nAfter the \"old folks\" had considerately retired, who knows but that the\r\nsons and daughters of Puritans sometimes wound up with a dance? There\r\nwere sleigh-rides, and the woods rang with the happy laugh and jingling\r\nbells. The vehicles used on these occasions were, prior to 1700, more\r\nproperly called \"sleds.\" Our modern \"sleigh\" had not then been\r\nintroduced. As the spring came on, logs would be hollowed or scooped\r\nout and placed near the feet of sugar maples, a slanting incision made\r\na foot or two above them in the trunks of the trees, a slip of shingle\r\ninserted, and the delicious sap would trickle down into the troughs.\r\nWhen the proper time came, tents or booths made of evergreen boughs\r\nwould be erected in the woods, great kettles hung over blazing fires,\r\nand a whole neighborhood camp out for several days and nights, until\r\nthe work was accomplished, and the flavory syrup or solid cakes of\r\nsugar brought out.\r\n\r\nThese were some of the recreations of the country people in the early\r\nsettlements of New England; continuing, perhaps, in frontier towns to\r\nthis day. They constituted forms of enjoyment which cannot exist in\r\ncities or older communities; and possessed a charm, in the memory of\r\nall who ever participated in them, greater, far greater, than society\r\nin any later stage can possess.\r\n\r\nThe principal method of travelling in those days was on horseback. It\r\nafforded many special opportunities for social enjoyment. Women as well\r\nas men were trained to it. The people of the village were all[i.204] at\r\nhome in the saddle. The daughters of Joseph Putnam, sisters of Israel,\r\nwere celebrated as equestrians. Tradition relates adventurous feats of\r\ntheirs in this line, equal to that which constitutes a part of the\r\nhistory of their famous brother. There were, perhaps, several games of\r\nskill or chance practised more or less, even in those days, in this\r\nneighborhood. The only one that seems to have been openly allowed, of\r\nwhich we have any evidence, was shovel-board. This game, now supposed\r\nto be out of use, is referred to by Shakespeare, and was quite common\r\nin England as well as in this country. A board about two and a half\r\nfeet wide and twenty feet long was placed three feet above the floor,\r\nsomewhat like a billiard-table, though not with so wide a surface,\r\nprecisely level and perfectly smooth, covered with a sprinkling of fine\r\nsand. It was provided with weights or balls, called \"pieces,\" flattened\r\non one end. The game consisted in shoving them as far as possible,\r\nwithout going over the end. A trough surrounded the table to catch the\r\npieces if they fell. Richard Grant White, from whom this account of the\r\ngame has been derived, says that \"it required great accuracy of eye,\r\nand steadiness of hand, much more than ten-pins.\" He states that, when\r\na boy, he saw it played by \"brawny\" men, in Brooklyn, N.Y., and that\r\nthe pieces then used were of brass. It is probable that the \"pieces\"\r\nused on Bridget Bishop's shovel-board were made of some heavy wood, as\r\nthey were thrown into the fire for the purpose of destroying them. The\r\nfact that a game like this was suffered to[i.205] be openly played in\r\nSalem Village is quite remarkable, and shows that some license was left\r\nfor such amusements.\r\n\r\nThe records and files of the local courts show, that, notwithstanding\r\nthe austere gravity and strictness of manners and morals usually\r\nascribed to our New-England ancestors, occasional irregularities\r\noccurred in the early settlements, which would be considered high\r\nmisdemeanors in our day. The following deposition was given \"on oath\r\nbefore the Court,\" Feb. 26, 1651. Edward Norris was the son of the\r\nminister of the First Church; had been for more than ten years, and\r\ncontinued to be for twenty years after, schoolmaster of the town; and,\r\nby his character as well as office, commanded the highest respect. John\r\nKitchen, in 1655, was chosen \"searcher and sealer of leather.\" Giles\r\nCorey had not yet purchased his farm, but lived on his town-lot,\r\nextending from Essex Street, near its western extremity, to the North\r\nRiver. They were severally persons of good estate.\r\n\r\n\"The Testimony of Giles Corey.—Mr. Edward Norris and I were going\r\ntowards the brickkiln: John Kitchen, going with us, fell a nipping and\r\npinching of us. And, when we came back again, John Kitchen struck up\r\nMr. Edward Norris his heels and mine, and fell upon me, and catched me\r\nby the throat, and held me so long till he had almost stopped my\r\nbreath. And I said unto John Kitchen, 'This is not good jesting.' And\r\nJohn Kitchen replied, 'This is nothing: I do owe you more than this of\r\nold: this is not half of that which you shall have afterwards.' After\r\nthis,[i.206] he went into his house, and he took stinking water and\r\nthrew upon us, and took me and thrust me out of doors, and I went my\r\nways. And John Kitchen followed me half-way up the lane, or\r\nthereabouts. Perceiving him to follow me, I went to go over the rails.\r\nHe took me again, and threw me down off the rails, and fell a beating\r\nof me until I was all bloody. And, Thomas Bishop being present, I\r\ndesired him to bear witness of what he saw. Upon my words, he let me\r\nrise. As soon as I was up, he fell a beating of me again.\r\n\r\n\"Testified on oath before the Court, 26th Feb., 1651.\r\n\r\n\"Henry Bartholomew, _Clerk_.\"\r\n\r\nThis was indeed an extraordinary outburst of lawless violence, and\r\ngives a singular insight of the state of society. Such an occurrence in\r\nour day would create astonishment. The organized power of the community\r\nto suppress vicious and rude passions was probably never brought to\r\nbear with greater rigidness than in our Puritan villages; but it did\r\nnot fully accomplish its end. Behind and beneath the solemn and formal\r\nexterior, there was, after all, perhaps as much irregularity of life as\r\nnow. The nature of man had not been subdued. The people had their\r\nquarrels and fights, and their frolics and merriments, in defiance of\r\nthe restraints of authority. Violations of local and general laws were\r\nnot infrequent; and flowed, as ever since, from intemperance, in as\r\nlarge a measure. Kitchen, in this instance, acted as if under the\r\ninfluence of liquor. His behavior, in tripping up the heels and\r\nthrowing dirty water upon the person of the school[i.207]master of the\r\ntown, the dignity of whose social position is indicated by the title of\r\n\"Mr.;\" and in giving to Corey such a persistent and gratuitous\r\npommelling,—bears the aspect of a drunken delirium. The latter seems\r\nnot to have supposed, for some time, that he was in earnest, but to\r\nhave looked upon his conduct as rough play, which was carried rather\r\ntoo far. Poor Corey was often getting before the town Court as accused\r\nor accuser. He was, to the end, the victim of ill-usage, either given\r\nor taken. Though not a bad-natured man, he was almost always in\r\ntrouble. The tenor of his long life was as eccentric and unruly as the\r\nmanner of his death was strange and horrible.\r\n\r\nThere was what may be called an institution in the rural parishes of\r\nthe early times, still existing to some extent perhaps in country\r\nplaces, which must not be omitted in an enumeration of controlling\r\ninfluences. The people lived on farms, at some distance from each\r\nother, and almost all at great distances from the meeting-house. Local\r\nand parental authority, church discipline, public opinion, enforced\r\nattendance upon the regular religious services. Fashion, habit, and\r\nchoice concurred in bringing all to meeting on the Lord's Day. It was\r\nimpossible for many to return home during the intermission between the\r\nservices of the forenoon and afternoon. The effect was, that the whole\r\ncommunity were thrown and kept together every week for several hours,\r\nduring which they could not avoid social intercourse. It was a more\r\neffective institution than the town-meeting; for it occurred oftener,\r\nand[i.208] included women and children. In pleasant weather, they would\r\nperhaps gather together in knots at eligible places, or stroll off in\r\ncompanies to the shades of the neighboring woods. In bad weather, they\r\nwould remain in the meeting-house, or congregate at Deacon Ingersoll's\r\nordinary, or in the great rooms of his dwelling-house. As a whole, this\r\npractice must have produced important results upon the character of the\r\npeople. In the absence of newspapers, or of much intercourse with\r\nremote places, the day was made the occasion for hearing and telling\r\nall the news. It provided for the circulation of ideas, good and bad.\r\nIt widened the sphere of influence of the wiser and better sort, and\r\ngave opportunity for mischievous people to do much harm. It was a sort\r\nof central bazaar, open every week, where all the varieties of local\r\ngossip could be interchanged and circulated far and wide. Of the\r\naggregate character of the effects thus produced, I do not propose to\r\nstrike the balance. It was undoubtedly an effective instrumentality in\r\nmoulding the population of the country, developing the elements of\r\nsociety, quickening and rendering more vigorous the action of the\r\npeople in masses, and elucidating the phenomena of their history. It\r\nanswers my purpose, at present, to suggest, that, if any popular\r\ndelusion or fanaticism arose, the means of giving it a rapid diffusion,\r\nand of intensifying its power, were in this way provided.\r\n\r\nIn the early settlement of the country, the pursuit of game in the\r\nforests, rivers, and lakes, was necessary as a means of subsistence,\r\nand has always been im[i.209]portant in that view. A war against beasts\r\nand birds of prey was also required to be incessantly kept up. The\r\nmethods adopted for these ends were various and ingenious, often\r\nrequiring courage and skill, and in most instances conducted in\r\ncompanies. Deer and moose were sometimes caged by surrounding them, or\r\ntrapped; but the gun was chiefly relied upon in their pursuit. There\r\nwere various methods for catching the smaller animals. One of the\r\nsports of boyhood was to spring the rabbits or hares. A sapling, or\r\nyoung tree, was bent down and fastened to a stick slid into notches cut\r\nin trees, on each side of the path of the animal. The rabbit is wont to\r\nrace through the woods at great speed, and along established tracks,\r\nwhich, particularly after snow has fallen, are clearly traceable. To\r\nthe cross-stick, thus placed above the path, one end of a strong\r\nhorse-hair was tied. The other end was in a slip-knot, with a noose\r\njust large enough, and hanging at the height, to receive the head of\r\nthe rabbit. Not seeing the noose, and rushing along the path, the\r\nrabbit would jerk the cross-stick out of the notches. The tree would\r\nbound back to its original upright direction, and the rabbit remain\r\nswinging aloft, until, at the break of day, the boys would rejoice in\r\nthe success of their stratagem. Pigeons in clouds frequented the\r\ncountry in their seasons, and acres upon acres of the forests bowed\r\nbeneath their weight. They were taken by nets, dozens at a time, or\r\nbrought down in great numbers by shot-guns. The marshalled hosts of\r\nwild geese made their noisy flights over the land in the[i.210] spring\r\nand fall, traversing a space spanning the continent north and south.\r\nThey were brought down by the gun, on the wing, or surprised while\r\nresting in their long route or stopped by storms, around secluded ponds\r\nor swamps. Ducks and other aquatic birds were abundant on the rivers\r\nand marshes, and pursued in canoes along the bays and seashores.\r\nSalt-water fish were within reach in the neighboring ocean; while an\r\nunfailing supply of fresh-water fish was yielded by Wenham Lake,\r\nWilkins's Pond, and the running streams.\r\n\r\nThe bear was a formidable prowler around the settlements, killing young\r\ncattle, making havoc in the sheepfold, and depredating upon the barn\r\nand farm yard. He was a dangerous antagonist, of immense strength in\r\nhis arms and claws. Sometimes he was reached effectually by the gun,\r\nbut the trap was mainly relied upon to secure him. His skin made him a\r\nvaluable prize, and he supplied other beneficial uses. The earliest and\r\nrudest method of trapping a bear was as follows: A place was selected\r\nin the woods, where two large fallen and mouldering trees were side by\r\nside within two or three feet of each other. The space between them\r\nwould be roofed over by throwing branches and boughs across them, and\r\nclosed up at one end. The other end would be left open. A gun was\r\nplaced inside, heavily loaded, the muzzle towards the open end; to the\r\ntrigger a cord was fastened running along by the barrel of the gun,\r\npassing over a cross-bar, and hanging down directly before the muzzle,\r\nbaited with a piece of fresh meat. The bear,[i.211] ranging in the\r\nwoods at night, would be attracted by the smell of meat, and come\r\nsnuffing around. At the open end, he would see the bait, rush in, seize\r\nit between his jaws, pull the cord, discharge the gun, and his head and\r\nbreast be torn to pieces. The men engaged in the enterprise would\r\nremain awake in some neighboring house, waiting and listening, with the\r\nextremest interest, for the report of the gun to announce their\r\nsuccess. At the break of day, they would gather to the spot, and\r\nparticipate in the profit of the capture. After a while, iron or steel\r\ntraps were introduced. They would be skilfully baited and set, and\r\nfastened to a tree by a chain. The whole was covered over with light\r\nsoil and leaves. The bear would make for the bait. The weight of his\r\npaw would spring the trap. The iron-teeth would hold him fast till the\r\nmorning. In his suffering and exasperation, it would require\r\nconsiderable effort to despatch him. In catching bears, as well as\r\nfoxes, much skill and art were needed. They were each very wary and\r\ncautious; and, where iron was used in the traps, some scent was\r\nnecessary to disguise the smell of the metal. All appearance of having\r\nbeen disturbed had to be removed from the ground. Trapping became quite\r\na science, and was a pursuit of much importance.\r\n\r\nWolves were perhaps the most destructive of the beasts of prey.\r\nAlthough not so large or strong as bears, they were far more fierce and\r\nrapacious. Bears could be tamed, but wolves not. Bears were not\r\ndangerous, unless provoked, or suffering from hunger, or[i.212] alarmed\r\nfor the safety of their young. It was thought that kind treatment would\r\nawaken strong attachment in them, but wolves were always snarling and\r\nferocious. They roamed mostly in packs, and would kill sheep, lambs,\r\nand poultry long after hunger was appeased. The farmers regarded them\r\nas their great enemy. A long and deep trench would be dug, lined with\r\nslippery logs, from which the bark had been taken, standing upright,\r\nand touching each other. The trench was covered by a slight framework,\r\nupon which leaves and dirt were scattered, to make the surface appear\r\nlike the surrounding territory. Some savory bait would be placed over\r\nit. The wolves, rushing on, would break through. Not being able to\r\nascend the sides, they would be found alive, the next morning, at the\r\nbottom. These were called \"wolf-pits.\" It was no easy matter to dispose\r\nof or despatch the furious animals, and the wolf-pits were often the\r\nscenes of much excitement. There was another class of animals,—divided\r\ninto different species, mostly according to their size,—smaller but\r\nfiercer than wolves, of extraordinary strength and activity, called\r\nwild-cats, catamounts, or loup-cerviers, pronounced by the farmers\r\nlucifees. These were only taken by the gun. It was considered a useful\r\npublic service, and no inconsiderable feat, to kill them.\r\n\r\nSome of the laborious employments, at that time, were especially\r\npromotive of social influence; for instance, the making and mending\r\nhighways. This was secured by a tax, annually levied in town-meeting.\r\nThe work was placed under the care and direction of[i.213] surveyors,\r\nannually chosen. A small part of this tax, however, was paid in money.\r\nMost of it was \"worked out.\" At convenient seasons, when there was a\r\nrespite from the ordinary farm work, the men of a neighborhood would\r\ncome together, in greater or less numbers, at a designated time and\r\nplace, with their oxen and implements. Working in unison, they would\r\nwork merrily and with energy; and, as the tough roots and deeply bedded\r\nrocks gave way to the pickaxe, crowbar, and chain, and rough places\r\nbecame smooth, the wilderness would echo back their voices of\r\ngratulation, and a spirit of animating rivalry stimulate their toils.\r\nMany other operations were carried on, such as getting up hay from the\r\nsalt-marshes and building stone-walls, by neighbors working in\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\nParticular circumstances in the history of the population of Salem\r\nVillage contributed to keep up a condition of general intelligence,\r\nwhich served, to some degree, as a substitute for an organized system\r\nof education. Indeed, any thing like regular schools was rendered\r\nimpossible by the then-existing circumstances. Clearings had made a\r\nvery inconsiderable encroachment on the wilderness. There were here and\r\nthere farmhouses, with deep forests between. It was long before easily\r\ntraversable roads could be made. A schoolhouse placed permanently on\r\nany particular spot would be within the reach of but very few. Farmers\r\nmost competent to the work, who had enjoyed the advantages of some\r\ndegree of education, and could manage to set apart any time for the\r\npur[i.214]pose, were, in some instances, prevailed upon to receive such\r\nchildren as were within reaching distance as pupils in their own\r\nhouses, to be instructed by them at stated times and for a limited\r\nperiod. Daniel Andrew rendered this service occasionally. At one\r\nperiod, we find them practising the plan of a movable school and\r\nschoolmaster. He would be stationed in the houses of particular\r\npersons, with whom the arrangement could be made, a month at a time, in\r\nthe different quarters of the village, from Will's Hill to Bass River.\r\nOf course, there was a great lack of elementary education. For a\r\nconsiderable time, it was reduced to a very low point; and there were\r\nheads of families,—men who had good farms, and possessed the confidence\r\nand respect of their neighbors,—who appear not to have been able to\r\nwrite.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, however, to come to a definite estimate on this\r\nsubject, as the singular fact is discovered, that some persons, who\r\ncould write, occasionally preferred to \"make their mark.\" Ann Putnam,\r\nin executing her will, made her mark; but her confession, with her own\r\nproper written signature, is spread out in the Church-book. Francis\r\nNurse very frequently used his peculiar mark, representing, perhaps,\r\nsome implement of his original mechanical trade; but, on other\r\noccasions, he wrote out his name in a good, round hand. The same was\r\nthe case with Bray Wilkins. We can hardly reach any decisive\r\nconclusions as to the intelligence or education of the people of that\r\nday from their handwriting, or construction of sentences, much[i.215]\r\nless from their spelling. Their forms of speech were very different\r\nfrom ours in many respects. What, at first view, we might be apt to\r\ncall errors of ignorance, were perhaps conformity to good usage at the\r\ntime. Their use of verbs is different from ours, particularly in the\r\nsubjunctive mood, and in conjugation generally. They did not follow our\r\nrule in reference to number. When the nominative was a plural noun, or\r\nseveral nouns, they often employ the connected verb in the singular\r\nnumber, and _vice versâ_. They were inclined to make construction\r\nconform to the sense, rather than to the letter. It is not certain that\r\ntheir usage, in this particular, is wholly indefensible. Cicero, in his\r\nfifth oration against Verres, couples _rem_ with _futurum_. This was\r\nlooked upon by some editors as an error, and they altered the text\r\naccordingly; but Aulus Gelius, in his \"Attic Nights,\" maintains that it\r\nis the true reading, and, in view of the sense of the passage, a\r\nlegitimate and elegant use of language. He cites instances, in Latin\r\nand Greek authors of the highest standard, of a similar usage.\r\n\r\nNothing, or scarcely any thing, can be inferred from spelling. It was\r\nwholly unsettled among the best-educated men, and in the practice of\r\nthe same person. In Winthrop's \"Journal,\" he spells the name of his\r\ndistinguished friend—the governor of both Massachusetts and\r\nConnecticut—sometimes Haynes, and sometimes Haines. The _r_ is\r\ngenerally dropped from his own signature, or, if not intentionally\r\ndropped, is quite lost in one or the other of the contiguous\r\nlet[i.216]ters. It is a curious circumstance, that the name \"Winthrop\"\r\nis spelled differently by our governor, his wife, and his son, the\r\ngovernor of Connecticut; each varying from either of the other two.\r\nGeorge Burroughs, a graduate of Harvard College, wrote his own name\r\nsometimes with, and sometimes without, the _s_. In our General-court\r\nrecords, the name of the first Captain Davenport is spelled in at least\r\nfour different ways. The Putnams sometimes wrote their name Putman. The\r\nname of the Nurses was often written Nourse, and sometimes Nurs.\r\n\r\nUnable to come to any reliable conclusions in reference to the general\r\nintelligence of the people of Salem Village from their orthography,\r\netymology, syntax, or chirography, compared with their contemporaries,\r\nI can only say, that, in examining the records and papers which have\r\ncome down to us, the wonder to me is that they expressed themselves so\r\nwell. I do not hesitate to say, that, in the various controversies in\r\nwhich they were involved, prior to and immediately after the witchcraft\r\ndelusion, there is a pervading appearance of uncommon appreciation of\r\nthe questions at issue, and substantial evidence that there was a solid\r\nsubstratum of good sense among them.\r\n\r\nTheir manners appear to have been remarkably courteous and respectful,\r\nshowing the effect still remaining upon their style of intercourse and\r\npersonal bearing, of the society and example of the great number of\r\neminent, enlightened, and accomplished men and families that had\r\nresided or mingled with them during all[i.217] the early period of\r\ntheir history. In their deportment to each other, there was that sort\r\nof decorum which indicates good breeding. They paid honor to gray\r\nhairs, and assigned to age the first rank in seating the\r\ncongregation,—a matter to which, before the introduction of pews as a\r\nparticular property, they gave the greatest consideration. The\r\n\"seating\" was to continue for a year; and a committee of persons who\r\nwould command the greatest confidence was regularly appointed to report\r\non the delicate and difficult subject. Their report, signed by them\r\nseverally, was entered in full in the parish record-book. The\r\ninvariable rule was, first, age; then, office; last, rates. The chief\r\nseats were given to old men and women of respectable characters,\r\nwithout regard to their circumstances in life or position in society.\r\nThen came the families of the minister and deacons, the parish\r\ncommittee and clerk, the constable of the village, magistrates, and\r\nmilitary officers. These were preferred, because all offices were then\r\nhonorable, and held, if they were called to them, by the principal\r\npeople. Last came rates,—that is, property. The richest man in the\r\nparish, if not holding office, or old enough to be counted among the\r\naged, would take his place with the residue of the congregation. The\r\nmanner in which parents were spoken of on all occasions is quite\r\nobservable, not only in written documents, but ordinary\r\nconversation,—always with tender respectfulness. In almost all cases,\r\nthe expressions used are \"my honored father\" or \"my honored mother,\"\r\nand this by per[i.218]sons in the humblest and most inferior positions\r\nin life. The terms \"Goodman\" and \"Goodwife\" were applied to the heads\r\nof families. The latter word was abbreviated to \"Goody,\" but not at\r\nall, as our dictionaries have it, as a \"low term of civility.\" It was\r\napplied to the most honored matrons, such as the wife of Deacon\r\nIngersoll. It was a term of respect; conveying, perhaps, an\r\naffectionate sentiment, but not in the slightest degree disrespectful,\r\nderogatory, or belittling. Surely no better terms were ever used to\r\ncharacterize a worthy person. \"Goodman\" comprehends all that can be\r\nascribed to a citizen of mature years in the way of commendation; and\r\nthe whole catalogue of pretentious titles ever given by flatterers or\r\ncourtiers to a married lady cannot, all combined, convey a higher\r\nencomium than the term \"Goodwife.\" How much more expressive, courteous\r\nto the persons to whom they are applied, and consistent with the\r\nself-respect of the person using them, than \"Mr.\" and \"Mrs.\"! A more\r\nthan questionable taste and a foolish pride have led us to adopt these\r\nterms because they were originally applicable to the gentry or to\r\nmagistrates, and to abandon the good old words which had a meaning\r\ntruly polite to others, and not degrading to ourselves!\r\n\r\nA patriarchal authority and dignity was recognized in families. The\r\noldest member was often called, by way of distinction, \"Landlord,\"\r\nmerely on account of his seniority, without reference particularly to\r\nthe extent of his domain or the value of his acres. After[i.219] the\r\ndeath of Thomas Putnam, in 1686, his brother Nathaniel had the title;\r\nafter him, the surviving brother, Captain John; after him, it fell to\r\nthe next generation, and Benjamin, a son of Nathaniel, became \"Landlord\r\nPutnam.\" It was so with other families.\r\n\r\nThe liberal and judicious policy, before described, of giving estates\r\nto children on their marriage, with the maintenance of parental\r\nauthority in the household, produced the desired effect upon the\r\ncharacter of the people. It was almost a matter of course, that, on\r\nreaching mature years, young men and women would own the covenant, and\r\nbecome members of the church. The general tone of society was\r\nundoubtedly favorable to the moral and religious welfare of the younger\r\nportion of the community. Some exceptions occurred, but few in number.\r\nOne case, however, in which there was a flagrant violation of filial\r\nduty, may not be omitted in this connection; for it belongs to the\r\npublic history of the country.\r\n\r\nJohn Porter, Jr., the eldest son of the founder of that most\r\nrespectable family, about thirty years of age, appears to have been a\r\nvery wicked and incorrigible person. His abusive treatment of his\r\nparents reached a point where it became necessary, in the last resort,\r\nto appeal to the protection of the law. After various proceedings, he\r\nwas finally sentenced to stand on the ladder of the gallows with a rope\r\naround his neck for an hour; to be severely whipped; committed to the\r\nHouse of Correction; kept closely at work on[i.220] prison diet, not to\r\nbe released until so ordered by the Court of Assistants or the General\r\nCourt; and to pay \"a fine to the country of two hundred pounds.\" It is\r\nstated, that, if the mother of the culprit \"had not been overmoved by\r\nher tender affections to forbear appearing against him, the Court must\r\nnecessarily have proceeded with him as a capital offender, according to\r\nour law being grounded upon and expressed in the Word of God, in Deut.\r\nxxi. 18 to 21. See Capital Laws, p. 9, § 14.\" Some time afterward, the\r\nGeneral Court, upon his petition, granted him a release from\r\nimprisonment, on condition of his immediate departure from this\r\njurisdiction; first giving a bond of two hundred pounds not to return\r\nwithout leave of the General Court or Court of Assistants.\r\n\r\nIn 1664, four commissioners, Colonel Richard Nichols, Sir Robert Carr,\r\nGeorge Cartwright, and Samuel Maverick, Esqs., were sent over by\r\nCharles II. \"to hear and determine complaints and appeals in all\r\ncauses, as well military as criminal and civil.\" There had always been\r\na powerful influence at work in the English Court adverse to New\r\nEngland. It had been thus far successfully baffled by the admirable\r\ndiplomacy of the colonial government and agents. All conflicts of\r\nauthority had been prevented from coming to a head by a skilful policy\r\nof \"protracting and avoiding.\" But the restoration of the Stuarts boded\r\nno good to the liberties of the colonies; and the arrival of these\r\ncommissioners with their sweeping authority was regarded as designed to\r\ndeal the long-deferred[i.221] fatal blow at chartered rights. They\r\nbegan with a high hand. The General Court did not quail before them,\r\nbut stood ready to take advantage of the first false step of the\r\ncommissioners; and they did not have long to wait.\r\n\r\nPorter had taken refuge in Rhode Island. When the commissioners visited\r\nthat colony, he appealed to them for redress against the Massachusetts\r\nGeneral Court. They were inconsiderate enough to espouse his cause, and\r\nissued a proclamation giving him protection to return to Boston to have\r\nhis case tried before them. The General Court at once took issue with\r\nthem, and changed their attitude from the defensive to the offensive;\r\ndenounced their proceedings; spread upon the official records a full\r\naccount, in the plainest language, of Porter's outrages upon his\r\nparents, exhibiting it in details that could not but shock every\r\nsentiment of humanity and decency; holding up the commissioners as the\r\nabettors and protectors of criminality of the deepest dye; and planting\r\nthemselves fair and square against them on the merits of Porter's case.\r\nThe commissioners tried to explain and extricate themselves; but they\r\ncould not escape from the toils in which, through rashness, they had\r\nbecome entangled. The General Court made a public declaration charging\r\nthe commissioners with \"obstructing the sentence of justice passed\r\nagainst that notorious offender,\" and with sheltering and countenancing\r\n\"his rebellion against his natural parents;\" with violating a court of\r\njustice, discharging a whole[i.222] country \"from their oaths whereby\r\nthey had sworn obedience to His Majesty's authority according to the\r\nConstitution of his Royal Charter;\" and with attempting to overthrow\r\nthe rights of the colony under the charter by bringing in a military\r\nforce to overawe and suppress the civil authorities. They denounced\r\nthem as guilty of a perversion of their trust, and as having committed\r\na breach upon the dignity of the crown, by pursuing a course\r\n\"derogatory to His Majesty's authority here established,\" and\r\n\"repugnant to His Majesty's princely and gracious intention in\r\nbetrusting them with such a commission.\" The Court held the\r\nvantage-ground, and the commissioners were unable to dislodge them. The\r\nend of the matter was, that the power of the commissioners was\r\ncompletely broken down. They ingloriously gave up the contest, and went\r\nhome to England.\r\n\r\nThe instance of John Porter, Jr., to which such extraordinary publicity\r\nand prominence were given by the circumstances now related, does not\r\nbear against what I have said of the general prevalence, in the rural\r\ncommunity of Salem Village, of parental authority and filial duty, as\r\nhe was early withdrawn from it to pursuits that led him into totally\r\ndifferent spheres of life. He had been engaged in trade, and exposed to\r\nvicious influences in foreign ports. In voyages to \"Barbadoes, and so\r\nfor England, he had prodigally wasted and riotously expended about four\r\nhundred pounds.\" Besides this, he had run himself, by his vicious\r\ncourses, into debts which his father had to pay[i.223] in order to\r\nrelease him from prison abroad. He came back the desperate character\r\ndescribed by the General Court. His punishment was severe, but\r\nabsolutely necessary, in the judgment of the whole community, for the\r\nsafety of his parents and the preservation of domestic and public\r\norder.\r\n\r\nAlthough living in humble dwellings on plain fare, working with their\r\nhands for daily bread, clad in rude garments, and practising a frugal\r\neconomy, there was a certain style of things about the people I am\r\ndescribing unlike what is ordinarily associated with our ideas of them.\r\nThe men wore swords or rapiers as a part of their daily apparel. Their\r\nwives had domestic servants. Every farmer had his hired laborers, and\r\nmany of them had slaves. The relation of servitude, however, differed\r\nfrom that on Southern plantations in many respects. The slaves, without\r\nany formal manumission, easily obtained their freedom, and often became\r\nlandholders. The courteous decorum acquired from the example of the\r\neminent men among the first planters long continued to mark the manners\r\nof this people; and its vestiges remain to the present day. It\r\nstrikingly appeared in the latter half of the last and the earlier\r\nperiod of this century in the persons of Judge Samuel Houlton, Colonel\r\nIsrael Hutchinson, General Moses Porter, and the late Judge Samuel\r\nPutnam.\r\n\r\nThe wise forethought of the company in London, at the outset of its\r\noperations, in providing for all that was needful to the establishment\r\nand welfare of the[i.224] colony, has already been described. It was\r\nmost strikingly illustrated in the careful selection of the first\r\nemigrants. Men were sought out who were experienced and skilful in the\r\nvarious mechanic arts. In the early population of Salem Farms, every\r\nspecies of handicraft was represented. When the number was less than a\r\nhundred householders, there were weavers, spinners, potters, joiners,\r\nhousewrights, wheelwrights, brickmakers and masons, blacksmiths,\r\ncoopers, painters, tailors, cordwainers, glovers, tanners, millers,\r\nmaltsters, skinners, sawyers, tray-makers, and dish-turners. Every\r\nabsolute want was provided for. These trades and callings were carried\r\non in connection with agricultural employments, and their continuance\r\nkept carefully in view by the heads of the principal families. John\r\nPutnam not only gave large farms to each of his sons, but he trained\r\nthem severally to some mechanical art. One was a weaver, another a\r\nbricklayer, &c. The farmer was also a mechanic, and every description\r\nof useful labor held in equal honor.\r\n\r\nAnother marked feature of this people was their military spirit. They\r\nwere kept in a state of universal and thorough organization to protect\r\nthemselves from Indian hostilities, or to respond, on any occasion, at\r\na moment's warning, to the call of the country. The sentinel at the\r\nwatch-house was ever on the alert. Authority was early obtained from\r\nthe General Court to form a foot company. All adults of every\r\ndescription, including men much beyond middle life,—every[i.225] one,\r\nin fact, who could carry a musket, belonged to it. Its officers were\r\nthe fathers of the village. Every title of rank, from corporal to\r\ncaptain, once obtained, was worn ever after through life. Jonathan\r\nWalcot, a citizen of the highest respectability, who had married as a\r\nsecond wife Deliverance a daughter of Thomas Putnam, and was one of the\r\ndeacons of the parish, was its captain. Nathaniel Ingersoll, the other\r\ndeacon, is spoken of from time to time as corporal, then sergeant, and\r\nfinally lieutenant. He served with that commission till late in life,\r\nand was always, after attaining that rank, known as either Lieutenant\r\nor Deacon Ingersoll. The eldest son of Thomas Putnam, a leading member\r\nof the church, a man of large property, and the clerk of the parish,\r\nwas one of the sergeants, always known as such. In our narrative, with\r\nwhich he will be found in most unfortunate connection, I shall speak of\r\nhim by that title. It will distinguish him from his father. This\r\n\"company\" had frequent drills, probably from the first, in the field\r\nleft by will afterwards for that purpose by Nathaniel Ingersoll. Often,\r\nno doubt, it paraded on the open grounds around the meeting-house, or\r\nin the fields of Joseph Hutchinson after the harvest had been gathered.\r\nIt marched and countermarched along the neighboring roads. It was\r\nalmost as much thought of as the \"church,\" officered by the same\r\npersons, and composed of the same men. It was a common practice, at the\r\nclose of a parade, before \"breaking line,\" for the captain to give\r\nnotices of prayer, church,[i.226] or parish meetings. Such men as\r\nRichard Leach, Thomas Fuller, and Nathaniel Putnam, esteemed it an\r\nhonor to bear titles in this company; and held them ever after through\r\nlife with pride, whether corporal, sergeant, lieutenant, or captain.\r\n\r\nA company of troopers was early formed, made up from the village and\r\nneighboring settlements. In the colonial records, under date of Oct. 8,\r\n1662, we find the following: \"Mr. George Corwin for captain, Mr. Thomas\r\nPutnam for lieutenant, Mr. Walter Price for cornet, being presented to\r\nthis Court as so chosen by the troopers of Salem, Lynn, &c., the Court\r\nallows and approves thereof.\" The inventory of Captain Corwin, before\r\ncited, indicates the stylish uniform he wore as captain of the\r\ntroopers. Each of the officers was a wealthy man; and it cannot be\r\ndoubted that a parade of the company was a dashing affair. The lapse of\r\ntime having thinned their ranks and removed their officers, a vigorous\r\nand successful attempt was made in October, 1678, to revive the\r\ncompany. Thirty-six men, belonging, as they say, \"to the reserve of\r\nSalem old troop,\" and very desirous \"of being serviceable to God and\r\nthe country,\" petition the General Court to re-organize them as a troop\r\nof horse, and to issue the necessary commissions. They request the\r\nappointment of William Brown, Jr., as captain, and Corporal John Putnam\r\nas lieutenant. The petition was granted, and the commissions issued.\r\nAmong the signers of this petition are Anthony Needham, Peter and\r\nEzekiel Cheever, Thomas Flint,[i.227] Thomas and Benjamin Wilkins,\r\nThomas and Jacob Fuller, John Procter, William Osborne, Thomas Putnam,\r\nJr., and others of the Farms. The officers named were men of property\r\nand energy; and the company of troopers was kept up ever afterwards,\r\nuntil all danger from Indians or other foes had passed away.\r\n\r\nIt is very observable how the military spirit with which this rural\r\ncommunity was so early imbued has descended through all generations.\r\nIsrael Putnam, the famous Revolutionary hero, a son of Joseph who was a\r\nyounger brother of Sergeant Thomas and Deacon Edward Putnam, was born\r\nin the village. His brother David, much older than himself, who\r\nflourished in the period anterior to the Revolution, was a celebrated\r\ncavalry officer. Colonel Timothy Pickering used to mention, among the\r\nrecollections of his boyhood, that David Putnam \"rode the best horse in\r\nthe province.\" General Rufus Putnam, a grandson of Deacon Edward, was a\r\ndistinguished brigadier in the army of the Revolution. There are few\r\nofficers of that army whose names are more honored than his by\r\nencomiums from the pen of Washington: and praise from him was praise\r\nindeed, for it was, like all his other judgments, the result of careful\r\nand discriminating observation. In a letter to the President of\r\nCongress, dated \"At camp above Trenton Falls, Dec. 20, 1776,\" he speaks\r\nof the fact, that, owing to a neglect on the part of the Government to\r\nplace the Engineer Department upon a proper footing, \"Colo[i.228]nel\r\nPutnam, who was at the head of it, has quitted, and taken a regiment in\r\nthe State of Massachusetts.\" He expresses the opinion, that Putnam's\r\nqualifications as a military engineer were superior to those of any\r\nother man within his knowledge, far superior to those of the foreign\r\nofficers whom he had seen. In a letter to the same, dated \"Pompton\r\nPlains,\" July 12, 1777, speaking of General Schuyler's army, he says,\r\n\"Colonel Putnam, I imagine, will be with him before this, as his\r\nregiment is a part of Nixon's Brigade, who will answer every purpose he\r\ncan possibly have for an engineer at this crisis.\" The high opinion of\r\nWashington took effect in his promotion as brigadier-general. At the\r\nend of the war, he returned to civil life, but was soon called back and\r\nre-commissioned as brigadier-general. Washington felt the need of him.\r\nIn a letter to General Knox, Secretary of War, dated Aug. 13, 1792, he\r\nsays, \"General Putnam merits thanks, in my opinion, for his plan, and\r\nthe sentiments he has delivered on what he conceives to be a proper\r\nmode of carrying on the war against the hostile nations of Indians; and\r\nI wish he would continue to furnish them without reserve in future.\"\r\nDuring Washington's administration of the government under the\r\nConstitution, Rufus Putnam held the office of Surveyor-General of the\r\nUnited States. In addition to his military reputation, he will be for\r\never memorable as the first settler of Marietta, and founder of the\r\nState of Ohio.\r\n\r\nIsrael Hutchinson was born in 1727. In 1757 he[i.229] was one of a\r\nscouting-party under the command of his neighbor, Captain Israel\r\nHerrick, that penetrated through the wilderness in Maine in perilous\r\nIndian warfare. He fought at Ticonderoga and Lake George, and was with\r\nWolfe when he scaled the Heights of Abraham. On the morning of the 19th\r\nof April, 1775, he led a company of minute-men, who met and fought the\r\nBritish in their bloody retreat from Lexington. He was prominently\r\nconcerned during the siege of Boston; and, on its evacuation, took\r\ncommand at Fort Hill. He was afterwards in command at Forts Lee and\r\nWashington. Throughout the war, he, like both the Putnams, had the\r\nconfidence of his commander-in-chief. For twenty-one years, he was\r\nelected to one or the other branch of the Legislature, or to the\r\nCouncil. He was distinguished for the courtesy of his manners and the\r\ndignity of his address. Colonel Enoch Putnam was also at the battle of\r\nLexington, and served with honor through the Revolutionary War, as did\r\nalso Captain Jeremiah Putnam, both of them descendants of John. Captain\r\nSamuel Flint was among the bravest of the brave at Lexington, exciting\r\nuniversal admiration by his intrepidity; and fell at the head of his\r\ncompany at Stillwater, Oct. 7, 1777.\r\n\r\nIntelligence of the marching of the British towards Lexington, on the\r\n19th of April, 1775, reached the lower part of Danvers about nine\r\no'clock that morning. With a rapidity that is perfectly marvellous,\r\nwhen we consider the distances from each other over which the[i.230]\r\ninhabitants were scattered, five companies, fully organized and\r\nequipped,—each of them containing men of the village,—rushed to the\r\nfield in time to meet the retreating enemy at West Cambridge. It was a\r\nrally and a march without precedent, and never yet surpassed. The day\r\nwas extremely sultry for the season; and the distance traversed by many\r\nof the men from the village, before they got into that fight, could not\r\nhave been less than twenty miles. Seven belonging to Danvers companies\r\nwere killed, and others wounded. A larger offering was made that day at\r\nthe baptismal sacrifice to American liberty by Danvers than by any\r\nother town except Lexington; and no town represented in the scene was\r\nmore remote. Of the men who fell on this occasion, the following appear\r\nto have been of the village: Samuel Cook, Benjamin Daland, and Perley\r\nPutnam,—the last a descendant of John. Their bodies were brought home,\r\nand buried with appropriate honors; two companies from Salem, and\r\nmilitary detachments from Newburyport, Amesbury, and Salisbury\r\nparticipating in the ceremonies, and giving the soldier's tribute to\r\ntheir glory, by volleys over their closing graves.\r\n\r\nMoses Porter, when eighteen years of age, attracted attention by his\r\nheroic courage and indomitable pluck at Bunker Hill. He was in an\r\nartillery company, and would not quit his gun when almost every other\r\nman had fallen. His country never allowed him to quit it afterwards.\r\nFrom that day, he bore a commission in the army of the United States.\r\nHe was retained on[i.231] every peace establishment, always in the\r\nartillery, and at the head of that arm of the service for a great\r\nlength of time, and until the day of his death. He was in the battle of\r\nBrandywine, and wounded in a subsequent fight on the banks of the\r\nDelaware. He was with Wayne in his campaign against the Western\r\nIndians, and won his share of the glory that crowned it in the final\r\nbloody and decisive conflict. He was at the head of the artillery when\r\nthe war of 1812 took place, in active service on the Niagara frontier,\r\nand on the 10th of September, 1813, brevetted \"for distinguished\r\nservices.\" He commanded at Norfolk, in Virginia, in 1814, and received\r\ngreat credit for the ability and vigilance with which he held that most\r\nvital point of the coast defence. At successive periods after the war,\r\nhe was at the head of each of the geographical military divisions of\r\nthe country. He died at Cambridge, Mass., in 1822, while in command of\r\nthe Eastern Department, near the scene of his youthful glory,\r\nforty-seven years before. No man who fought at Bunker Hill remained so\r\nlong a soldier of the United States. No man had so extended a record,\r\nand it was bright with honor from the beginning to the end. His\r\npre-eminent reputation, as a disciplinarian and artillerist of the\r\nhighest class, was uniformly maintained. He added to the sterner\r\nqualities required by professional duty a polished urbanity of manners,\r\nand a dignified and commanding aspect and bearing. His ashes rest\r\nbeneath the sod of his ancestral acres in Salem Village.[i.232]\r\n\r\nWhen the great war for the suppression of the Southern Rebellion came\r\non, and the life of the Union was at stake, the same old spirit was\r\nfound unabated. A descendant of the family of Raymonds, emulating the\r\nexample of his ancestors, rallied his company to the front. At the end\r\nof the war, Lieutenant-Colonel John W. Raymond brought back, in\r\ncommand, the remnant of his veteran regiment, with its tattered\r\nbanners; two of his predecessors in that commission having fallen in\r\nbattle. The youthful patriot, William Lowell Putnam, who fell at Ball's\r\nBluff on the 21st of October, 1861, was a direct descendant of\r\nNathaniel Putnam. It is an interesting circumstance, that the names of\r\nmen who trained in the foot company and with the troopers on the fields\r\nand roads about the village meeting-house two hundred years ago have\r\nre-appeared in the persons of their descendants, in the highest lines\r\nof service and with unsurpassed distinction, in the three great wars of\r\nAmerica,—Major-General Israel, and Brigadier-General Rufus, Putnam, in\r\nthe War of the Revolution; Brigadier-General Moses Porter, in the War\r\nof 1812; and Major-General Granville M. Dodge, in the War of the\r\nRebellion. The last-named is a descendant of a hero of the Narragansett\r\nfight, and was born and educated in Salem Village.\r\n\r\nSeveral lawsuits, particularly in land cases, have been referred to.\r\nThey indicate, perhaps, to some extent the ingredients that aggravated\r\nthe terrible scenes we are preparing to contemplate. They served to\r\nkeep up the general intelligence of the community[i.233] through a\r\nperiod necessarily destitute of such means of information as we enjoy.\r\nAttendance upon courts of law, serving on juries, having to give\r\ntestimony at trials, are indeed in themselves no unimportant part in\r\nthe education of a people. Principles and questions of great moment are\r\nforced upon general attention, and become topics of discussion in\r\nplaces of gathering and at private firesides. Of this material of\r\nintelligence, the people of the village had their full share. It was\r\ntheir fate to have their minds, and more or less their passions,\r\nstirred up by special local controversies thrust upon them. As a\r\nreligious society, they had difficult points of disagreement with the\r\nmother-church, and the town of Salem. While they were supporting a\r\nminister and trying to build a meeting-house for themselves, attempts\r\nwere made to tax them to support the minister and build a new\r\nmeeting-house in the town. There was a natural reluctance to part with\r\nthem, and it was long before an arrangement could be made. The great\r\ndistance of many of the farmers from the town prevented their\r\nexercising what they deemed their rightful influence in municipal\r\naffairs. They felt, that, in many respects, their interests were not\r\nidentical, and in some absolutely at variance. These topics were much\r\ndiscussed, and with considerable feeling at times on both sides. The\r\npapers which remain relating to the subject show that the farmers\r\nunderstood it in all its bearings, and maintained their cause with\r\nclearness of perception and forcibleness of argument and expression. At\r\none time, they were[i.234] very desirous to be set off as a distinct\r\ntown, but this could not be allowed; and, finally, a sort of compromise\r\nwas effected. A partial separation—a semi-municipality—was agreed upon.\r\nSalem Village was the result.\r\n\r\nIn 1670, a petition, with twenty signers, was presented to the town to\r\nbe set off as a parish, and be allowed to provide a minister for\r\nthemselves. In March, 1672, the town granted the request; and, in\r\nOctober following, the General Court approved of the project, and gave\r\nit legal effect. The line agreed upon by the town and the village is\r\nsubstantially defined by the vote of the former, which was as follows:\r\n\"All farmers that now are, or hereafter shall be, willing to join\r\ntogether for providing a minister among themselves, whose habitations\r\nare above Ipswich Highway, from the horse bridge to the wooden bridge,\r\nat the hither end of Mr. Endicott's Plain, and from thence on a west\r\nline, shall have liberty to have a minister by themselves; and when\r\nthey shall provide and pay him in a maintenance, that then they shall\r\nbe discharged from their part of Salem ministers' maintenance,\" &c. The\r\n\"horse bridge\" was across Bass River. The \"wooden bridge\" was at the\r\nhead of Cow-House or Endicott River. Ipswich highway runs along from\r\none of these points to the other. The south line, beyond the wooden\r\nbridge, is seen on the map. All to the north of this line, and of\r\nIpswich highway between the bridges, to the bounds of Beverly and\r\nWenham on the east; Topsfield, Rowley Village,—since Boxford,[i.235]\r\nand Andover on the north; and Reading and Lynn on the west,—was the\r\nVillage. Middleton, incorporated afterwards, absorbed a large part of\r\nits western portion; but, at the time of the witchcraft delusion, the\r\nVillage was bounded as above described, and as in the map. There was a\r\nspecific arrangement fixing the point of time when the farmers were to\r\nbecome exempt from all charges in aid of the mother-church; that is, as\r\nsoon as they had provided for the support of a minister and the\r\nerection of a meeting-house of their own. It was further stipulated,\r\nthat the villagers should not form a church until a minister was\r\nordained; and that they should not settle a minister permanently\r\nwithout the approval of the old church, and its consent to proceed to\r\nan ordination. This latter restriction was perhaps the cause of all the\r\nsubsequent troubles.\r\n\r\nOwing, as has been stated in another connection, to erroneous notions\r\nabout the topography of the country; the incompetency perhaps, in some\r\ncases, of surveyors; and the want of due care in the General Court and\r\nthe towns to have boundaries clearly defined,—uncertainties and\r\nconflicting claims arose in various portions of the colony, but nowhere\r\nto a greater extent than here. The village became involved in\r\ncontroversies about boundaries with each one of its neighbors;\r\nproducing, at times, much exasperation. The documents drawn forth on\r\nthese questions, as they appear in the record-book of the village, are\r\nwritten with ability, and show that there were men among them who knew\r\nhow to express and enforce their[i.236] views. The plain, lucid,\r\nwell-considered style of Nathaniel Ingersoll's depositions on the\r\ncourt-files, in numerous cases, render it not improbable that his pen\r\nwas put in requisition. Sergeant Thomas Putnam, the parish recorder, as\r\nhe was sometimes entitled, was a good writer. His chirography, although\r\nnot handsome, is singularly uniform, full, open, and clear, so easily\r\nlegible that it is a refreshment to meet with it; and his sentences are\r\nwell-constructed, simple, condensed, and to the purpose. His words do\r\ntheir office in conveying his meaning. No public body ever had a better\r\nclerk. Somehow or other, he and others, brought up in the woods, had\r\ncontrived to acquire considerable efficiency in the use of the pen.\r\nPerhaps, a few who, like him, had parents able to afford it, had been\r\nsent to Ipswich or Charlestown to enjoy the privilege of what Cotton\r\nMather calls \"the Cheverian education.\"\r\n\r\nThe southern boundary of the village was intended to run due west from\r\nthe Ipswich road to Lynn, and was accordingly spoken of as \"on a west\r\nline.\" As originally established, it was defined by an enumeration of a\r\nvariety of objects such as trees of different kinds and sizes, as\r\nrunning through the lands of John Felton, Nathaniel Putnam, and Anthony\r\nNeedham, to \"a dry stump standing at the corner of Widow Pope's\r\ncow-pen, leaving her house and the saw-mill within the farmer's range,\"\r\nand so on to \"the top of the hill by the highway side near Berry Pond.\"\r\nFrom the changeable conditions of some of the objects, and a diversity\r\nof methods adopted by surveyors,—many[i.237] of them being unacquainted\r\nwith, or making no allowance for, the variation of the\r\ncompass,—controversies arose with the mother-town: and some\r\nproprietors, like the Gardners, were left in doubt how the line\r\naffected them; and there was, in consequence, much disquietude. The\r\nline was not accurately run until 1700.\r\n\r\nIt is observable, that the \"saw-mill\" is still in operation on the same\r\nspot. The \"cow-pen,\" then on the south side of the mill, was, more than\r\na century ago, removed to the north side, where it has remained ever\r\nsince. This estate has interesting reminiscences. It was an original\r\ngrant in January, 1640, to Edward Norris, at the time of his settlement\r\nas pastor of the First Church in Salem. He sold to Eleanor Trussler in\r\n1654. It then went into the possession of Henry Phelps, who sold to\r\nJoseph Pope in 1664. His widow, Gertrude, owned it in 1672. In 1793,\r\nEleazer Pope sold to Nathaniel Ropes, son of Judge Ropes, of Salem. His\r\nheirs sold it back to the Phelpses; and it is now in the possession of\r\nthe Rev. Willard Spaulding, of Salem. Originally given as an ordination\r\npresent to a minister of the old town, it has, after the lapse of two\r\nhundred and twenty-six years, come round into the hands of another. The\r\nhouse in which the Popes lived one hundred and twenty-nine years, and\r\nthe families that succeeded them for above half a century more,—a\r\nvenerable and picturesque specimen of the rural architecture, in its\r\nbest form, of the earliest times,—has, within the last ten years, given\r\nplace to a[i.238] new one on the same spot. In that old house, besides\r\nunnumbered and unknown instances of the same sort, Israel Putnam\r\nconducted his courtship; and there, on the 19th of July, 1739, he was\r\nmarried to Hannah, daughter of Joseph Pope.\r\n\r\nContests for what they deemed their rights with the old church and the\r\nborder towns and their own town, as in the case just mentioned,\r\nundoubtedly produced a bad effect upon the temper of the people, by\r\noccasional expenses that consumed their substance, and incidents that\r\nsowed the seeds of personal animosities; preparing the way for that\r\ndreadful convulsion which was near at hand. At the very time when the\r\nwitchcraft frenzy broke out, they were in the crisis of an exasperating\r\nconflict with Topsfield, occasioned by a wrong done them by the General\r\nCourt. This requires to be explained, as it can be, by a collation of\r\nfacts of record.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of March, 1636, the General Court passed an order that the\r\nbounds of Salem, Ipswich, and Newbury, should extend six miles into the\r\ncountry. It was afterwards defined to mean that \"the six-mile extent,\"\r\nas it was called, should be measured from the meeting-houses of the\r\nrespective towns. On the 5th of November, 1639, the General Court\r\npassed an order in these words: \"Whereas the inhabitants of Salem have\r\nagreed to plant a village near the river that runs to Ipswich, it is\r\nordered that all the land near their bounds between Salem and the said\r\nriver, not belonging to any other town or person by any former\r\ngrant,[i.239] shall belong to the said village.\" On the strength of\r\nthis order, the farmers in that part of Salem pushed settlements out\r\nbeyond the \"six-mile extent,\" over the ground thus pledged to them;\r\ncleared off the forests, built houses, brought the land under culture,\r\nerected bridges, made roads, and fulfilled their part of the contract\r\nby preparing to establish their village. Four years after the General\r\nCourt had thus pledged to \"inhabitants of Salem\" the privileges of a\r\nvillage organization on the lands between \"Salem and the said river,\"\r\nthey authorized some inhabitants of Ipswich, who had gone there, to\r\nestablish the village on the territory, independent of the Salem men.\r\nThis was an unjustifiable and flagrant violation of the stipulated\r\nagreement on the part of the General Court; because it appears by their\r\nown records, that Salem farmers had promptly fulfilled the condition on\r\ntheir part by going directly upon the ground, and getting farms under\r\nway there before 1643. This careless and indefensible procedure by the\r\nGeneral Court was the cause of interminable trouble and strife on the\r\ntract between Salem bounds and the river, introduced the elements of\r\ndiscord, and gave a color of legal justification to a conflict of\r\nauthority between Salem and Ipswich men. It sowed the seeds of\r\nanimosities which aggravated the scenes that occurred in Salem Village\r\nin 1692. In 1658, the General Court passed an order creating the town\r\nof Topsfield, including the larger part of these lands within its\r\nlimits. No heed was paid to the remonstrances, against these[i.240]\r\nproceedings, of the Salem farmers, who found themselves, without their\r\nconsent, permanently bereft of the benefit that had been promised them,\r\ncut off from all connection with the town of Salem, to which they\r\noriginally belonged, and put in the outskirts of another town. It was a\r\nclear case of wrong, and ought to have been rectified. But public\r\nbodies are more reluctant even than individuals to acknowledge\r\nthemselves in fault. The people of Salem Village joined in earnest\r\nprotests against the acts of the General Court. The old town of Salem\r\ndeclared by a public vote, that they had always regarded the lands in\r\ncontroversy as belonging to the village which, under the plighted faith\r\nof the General Court, their inhabitants had been forming. But it was\r\nall in vain. Neither remedy nor reparation could be obtained. The\r\nstruggle against this injustice lasted until some time after the\r\nwitchcraft occurrences had terminated, and was finally brought to a\r\nclose by an order of the Court, that the people on the territory might\r\nmaintain parish relations with Salem Village or with Topsfield, at\r\ntheir individual option. Entire satisfaction was never realized until,\r\nin 1728, they were incorporated, in accordance with their petition,\r\ninto a township, under the name of Middleton, with parts of Topsfield,\r\nBoxford, and Andover added. During a period of half a century, this\r\ngrievance remained unadjusted. The proceedings on the part of the\r\nvillage in its public action, as shown in the records, were conducted\r\nwith skill, ability, and firmness. But the col[i.241]lisions that\r\noccurred between particular parties were violent and bitter. Salem\r\nsettlers were called to pay parish and town rates to Topsfield, but\r\nrefused to do it. Constables and tax-collectors were defied. Topsfield\r\nwent so far as to claim not only unoccupied lands, but lands within\r\nfence, with houses on them, and families within them, and orchards and\r\ngrowing fields around them, as part of its \"commons;\" and it disputed\r\nthe titles given by Salem. Of course, the question went, in various\r\nforms, into the county courts; but sometimes, there is reason to\r\nbelieve, it came to a rougher arbitrament, in the depths of the woods,\r\nbetween man and man.\r\n\r\nJohn Putnam had gone out and settled lands between the \"six-mile\r\nextent\" of Salem and Ipswich River. Some of his sons had gone with him.\r\nThey had two dwelling-houses, cultivated meadows, orchards, &c. Isaac\r\nBurton says, that, one day, when near John Nichols's house, he heard a\r\ntree fall in the woods; and that he went to see who was chopping there.\r\nIt seems that Jacob Towne and John How, Topsfield men, had come in\r\ndefiance of John Putnam, and cut down a tree before his face. As they\r\nwere two to one, Putnam had to swallow the insult; but he was not the\r\nman to let it rest so. He went out shortly after, accompanied by an\r\nadequate force of sons and nephews, and proceeded to fell the trees.\r\nThe sound of the axes reached the ears of the Topsfield men; and Isaac\r\nEasty, Sr., John Easty, John Towne, and Joseph Towne, Jr., undertook to\r\nput a stop to the operation. On reaching the spot, they[i.242] warned\r\nPutnam against cutting timber. He replied, \"The timber now and here cut\r\ndown has been felled by me and my orders;\" and he proceeded to say, \"I\r\nwill keep cutting and carrying away from this land until next March.\"\r\nThey asked him, \"What, by violence?\" He answered, \"Aye, by violence.\r\nYou may sue me: you know where I dwell;\" and, turning to his company,\r\nhe said, \"Fall on.\" The Putnams were evidently the stronger party; and\r\nthe Topsfield men, counting forces, concluded, in their turn, that\r\ndiscretion, at that time, was the better part of valor. Such scenes\r\noccurred on the disputed ground for a whole generation. It is not\r\nwonderful that all sorts of animosities were kindled. The fact will be\r\nborne in mind, that Isaac Easty and son, with John Towne and son,\r\nconstituted the Topsfield force on this occasion.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted, that these controversies with the surrounding\r\ntowns, the mother-church, and the General Court itself, gradually\r\nengendered a very bad state of feeling. The people were deeply\r\nimpressed with a conviction that they had been wronged all around and\r\nall the way through. They felt that the whole world was against them;\r\nand when, by a train of mischievous influences, hell itself seemed to\r\nbe let loose upon them, it is not strange that they were driven to\r\ndistraction.\r\n\r\nWe come, at last, to that chapter in the history of Salem Village which\r\nwill lead us directly to the witchcraft delusion. Its religious\r\norganization was some[i.243]what peculiar; and, although instituted by\r\na particular arrangement made by the General Court, was, in one or two\r\nfeatures, a complete departure from the ecclesiastical polity elsewhere\r\nrigidly enforced. It was a congregation forbidden, for the time being,\r\nto have a church. It was a society for religious worship, administered,\r\nnot by professors of religion or by persons regarded at all in a\r\nreligious light, but by householders. The people of the village liked\r\nit, perhaps, all the better for this; and they took hold of it with a\r\nwill. Joseph Houlton gave to the parish five and a half acres of land,\r\nin the centre of the village, for the use of the minister. A\r\nparsonage-house was built, \"forty-two feet in length, twenty feet\r\nbroad, thirteen-feet stud, four chimneys, and no gable-ends.\" It was\r\nthe custom to have a leanto attached to their houses, generally on the\r\nnorthern side; and one was finally added to the parsonage. There was a\r\ngarden within the enclosure. Joseph Hutchinson gave an acre out of his\r\nbroad meadow as a site for the meeting-house and it was erected;\r\n\"thirty-four feet in length, twenty-eight feet broad, and sixteen feet\r\nbetween joints.\" Two end galleries were added, and a \"canopy\" placed\r\nover the pulpit. The mother-church, having about the same time built a\r\nnew meeting-house, voted to give \"the farmers their old pulpit and\r\ndeacons' seats,\" which were brought up and duly installed. In the\r\ncourse of these proceedings, some slight differences arose among them\r\nabout matters of detail, but not more than is usual in such cases. In\r\norder[i.244] to despatch at once all that may be required to be said\r\nabout the meeting-houses of the village, it may be allowable here to\r\nmention, that the original building did not survive the century. In\r\n1700, partly because the growth of the society began to require it, but\r\nmainly, no doubt, to escape from the painful associations which had\r\nbecome connected with it, a new meeting-house was built on another\r\nsite. The old one was dismantled of all its removable parts, and the\r\nsite reverted to Joseph Hutchinson. It is supposed that he removed the\r\nframe to the other side of the road, and converted it into a barn; and\r\nthat it was used as such until, in the memory of old persons now\r\nliving, it mouldered, crumbled into powder-post, and sunk to the\r\nground. It stood, after being converted into a barn, on the south side\r\nof the road, nearly in front of Joseph Hutchinson's homestead.\r\nHutchinson's dwelling-house was probably some distance further down in\r\nthe field, where the remains of an old cellar are still to be seen.\r\nNathaniel Ingersoll gave the land for the new meeting-house. The\r\nrecords contain the vote, that it \"shall stand upon Watch-House Hill,\r\nbefore Deacon Ingersoll's door.\" The meeting-houses of the society have\r\nstood there ever since. At that time, it was an elevated spot, probably\r\ncovered with the original forest; for the work of clearing, levelling,\r\nand preparing it for occupancy was so considerable as to require a\r\nspecial provision. The labor and expense of the operation were put on\r\nthat portion of the[i.245] congregation brought nearer to the\r\nmeeting-house by the change of the site.\r\n\r\nIn urging their petition to be set off as an independent parish,\r\ndistinct from the First Church in Salem, the people of the village\r\ndeclared, that, if they could not have a ministry established among\r\nthem, they would soon \"become worse than the heathen around them.\"\r\nLittle did they foresee the immediate, long-continued, and terrible\r\neffects that were to follow the boon thus prayed for. The establishment\r\nof the ministry among them was not merely an opening of Pandora's box:\r\nit was emptying and shaking it over their heads. It led them to a\r\ncondition of bitterness and violence, of confusion and convulsion, of\r\nhorror and misery, of cruelty and outrage, worse than heathen ever\r\nexperienced or savages inflicted.\r\n\r\nJames Bayley of Newbury, born Sept. 12, 1650, a graduate of Harvard\r\nCollege in the class of 1669, was employed to preach at the village. In\r\nOctober, 1671, he transferred his relations from the church in Newbury\r\nto the First Church in Salem. It seems that several persons of\r\nconsiderable influence in the village were dissatisfied with the manner\r\nin which he had been brought forward, and became prejudiced against\r\nhim. The disaffection was not removed, but suffered to take deep root\r\nin their minds. The parish soon became the scene of one of those\r\nviolent and heated dissensions to which religious societies are\r\nsometimes liable. The unhappy strife was aggravated from day to day,\r\nuntil it spread alienation and acrimony[i.246] throughout the village.\r\nA majority of the people were all along in favor of Bayley; but the\r\nminority were implacable. His engagement to preach was renewed from\r\nyear to year. At length, the controversy waxed so warm that some\r\ndefinite action became necessary. On the 10th of March, 1679, both\r\nparties applied to the mother-church for advice. A paper was presented\r\nby his opponents, with sixteen, and another from his friends, with\r\nthirty-nine signers. There was still another, also in his favor, signed\r\nby ten persons living near, but not within the village line. Although\r\nthe number of his opponents was so much less than of his friends, they\r\nincluded persons, such as Nathaniel Putnam and Bray Wilkins, of large\r\nestates and families, and much general influence; and it is evident\r\nthat the First Church was not inclined wholly to disregard them. The\r\nrecord of that church says, \"There was much agitation on both sides,\r\nand divers things were spoken of by the brethren; but the business\r\nbeing long, and many of the brethren gone, we could not make a church\r\nact of advice in the case; therefore it was left to another time.\" At a\r\nmeeting on the 22d of April, the Salem Church advised the minority \"to\r\nsubmit to the generality for the present;\" but, when a church should be\r\nformed there, \"then they might choose him or any other.\" This advice\r\ndoes not appear to have satisfied either party; and the quarrel went on\r\nwith renewed vehemence on both sides. At length, it reached such a\r\npitch that it became necessary to carry it up to the General[i.247]\r\nCourt. The whole affair was investigated by that body, and all the\r\npapers that had passed in relation to it were adduced. They are quite\r\nvoluminous, and on file in the office of the Secretary of State, in\r\nBoston. These interesting and curious documents illustrate the energy\r\nof action of both parties; and give, it is probable, the best picture\r\nanywhere to be found of a first-rate parish controversy of the olden\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe General Court came down upon the case with a strong hand. They\r\ndecided in favor of Bayley, whom they pronounced \"orthodox, and\r\ncompetently able, and of a blameless and self-denying conversation;\"\r\nand they \"do order, that Mr. Bayley be continued and settled the\r\nminister of that place, and that he be allowed sixty pounds per annum\r\nfor his maintenance, one-third part thereof in money, the other\r\ntwo-thirds in provisions of all sorts such as a family needs, at equal\r\nprices, and fuel for his family's occasions; this sum to be paid by the\r\ninhabitants of that place.\" This was thirteen pounds a year more than\r\nBayley's friends had ever voted for him. To make the matter sure, the\r\nGeneral Court required the parish to choose three or five men among\r\nthemselves to apportion every man's share of the tax to secure the\r\nsixty pounds: and, if any difficulty should occur in getting men among\r\nthemselves to perform this duty, they appointed to act, in that event,\r\nMr. Batter, Captain Jonathan Corwin, and Captain Price, of the old\r\nparish of Salem, to make the rate; and gave[i.248] ample power to the\r\nconstable of the village or the marshal of the county, to enforce the\r\ncollection of it, by distress and attachment, if any should neglect or\r\nrefuse to pay the sum assessed upon him. To make it still more certain\r\nthat Mr. Bayley should get his money, they ordered \"that all the rate\r\nis to be paid in for the use of the ministry unto two persons chosen by\r\nthe householders to supply the place of deacons for the time, who are\r\nto reckon with the people, and to deliver the same to the said minister\r\nor to his order.\" The arrangement as to the agency of deacons was \"to\r\ncontinue until the Court shall take further order, or that there be a\r\nchurch of Christ orderly gathered and approved in that place.\" This\r\nprocedure of the Court was a pretty high-handed stretch of power even\r\nfor those days; and giving the appointment of officers, with the title\r\nand character of deacons to mere householders, and where there was no\r\nchurch or organized body of professed believers, was in absolute\r\nconflict with the whole tenor and spirit of the ecclesiastical system\r\nthen in force and rigidly maintained elsewhere throughout the colony.\r\nThe Court seems itself to have been alarmed at the extent to which it\r\nhad gone in forcing Mr. Bayley upon the people of Salem Village, and\r\nfell back, in conclusion, upon the following proviso: \"This order shall\r\ncontinue for one year only from the last of September last past.\" The\r\ndate of the order was the 15th of October, 1679. It had less than a\r\nyear to run. In fact, the order, after all, before it comes to the end,\r\nis[i.249] diluted into a mere recommendation of Mr. Bayley. \"In the\r\nmean while, all parties,\" it is hoped, will \"endeavor an agreement in\r\nhim or some other meet person for a minister among them;\" but the\r\nGeneral Court takes care to wind up by demanding \"five pounds for\r\nhearing the case, the whole number of villagers equally to bear their\r\nproportion thereof.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the power thus incautiously conceded to householders was duly\r\nnoted, the apparently formidable action of the Court did not in the\r\nleast alarm the opposition, or in the slightest degree abate their\r\nzeal. The householders continued, as before, to manage all affairs\r\nrelating to the ministry in general meetings of the inhabitants. They\r\nproceeded at once to elect their two deacons. \"Corporal Nathaniel\r\nIngersoll\" was one of them; and he continued to hold the office, in\r\nparish and in church, for forty years.\r\n\r\nAs no attention was paid to the order of the General Court, so far as\r\nit attempted to fasten Mr. Bayley upon the parish; as the church in\r\nSalem would not take the responsibility of recommending his ordination\r\nin the face of such an opposition; and as it was out of the question to\r\nthink of reconciling or reducing it, Mr. Bayley concluded to retire\r\nfrom the conflict and quit the field; and his ministry in the village\r\ncame to an end. As evidence that the heat of this protracted\r\ncontroversy had not consumed all just and considerate sentiments in the\r\nminds of the people, I present the substance of a deed found in the\r\nEssex Registry. It will be noticed, that the most conspicu[i.250]ous of\r\nMr. Bayley's opponents, Nathaniel Putnam, is one of the parties to the\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n\"Thomas Putnam, Sr., Nathaniel Putnam, Sr., Thomas Fuller, Sr., John\r\nPutnam, Sr., and Joseph Hutchinson, Sr. Deed of gift to Mr. James\r\nBayley. Whereas, Mr. James Bayley, minister of the gospel, now resident\r\nof Salem Village, hath been in the exercise of his gifts by preaching\r\namongst us several years, having had a call thereunto by the\r\ninhabitants of the place; and at the said Mr. Bayley's first coming\r\namongst us, we above-named put the said Bayley in possession of a\r\nsuitable accommodation of land and meadow, for his more comfortable\r\nsubsistence amongst us. But the providence of God having so ordered it,\r\nthat the said Mr. Bayley doth not continue amongst us in the work of\r\nthe ministry, yet, considering the premises, and as a testimony of our\r\ngood affection to the said Mr. Bayley, and as full satisfaction of all\r\ndemands of us or any of us, of land relating to the premises, do by\r\nthese presents fully grant, &c., to said Bayley\" twenty-eight acres of\r\nupland, and thirteen acres of meadow in all. The several lots are\r\ndescribed in the deed, and constitute a very valuable property. The\r\ninstrument bears date May 6, 1680. Mr. Bayley's residence is indicated\r\non the map. The land on which it stood belonged to the part contributed\r\nby Nathaniel Putnam, with some acres in front of it contributed by\r\nJoseph Hutchinson. He continued to own and occasionally occupy his\r\nproperty in the village for some years after the witchcraft\r\ntrans[i.251]actions. He left the ministry, and prepared himself for the\r\nprofession of medicine, which he practised in Roxbury. He died on the\r\n17th of January, 1707.\r\n\r\nIt is not very easy to ascertain from the parish records, or from the\r\nmass of papers in the State-house files, the precise grounds of the\r\nobstinate controversy in reference to him. It is evident that it began\r\nin consequence of some alleged irregularity in the proceedings that led\r\nto his first engagement to preach at the village. There are\r\nintimations, that, in the tone and style of his preaching, he did not\r\nquite come up to the mark required by some. The objection does not seem\r\nto have been against his talents or learning, but, rather, that he did\r\nnot take hold with sufficient vehemence, or handle with sufficient zeal\r\nand warmth, points then engrossing attention. One or two expressions in\r\nthe papers which proceeded from his opponents seem to hint that he had\r\nnot the degree of strictness or severity in his aspect or ways thought\r\nnecessary in a minister. Papers in the files of the County Court bring\r\nto light, perhaps, precisely the shape in which the charges against him\r\nhad currency. On the 4th of April, 1679, complaint was made by Thomas\r\nand John Putnam, Srs., Daniel Andrew, and Nathaniel Ingersoll, against\r\nHenry Kenny \"for slandering our minister, Mr. Bayley, by reporting that\r\nhe doth not perform family duties in his family.\" This was an\r\nexpression then in use for \"family prayers.\" One young woman testified\r\nas follows: \"Being at Mr. Bayley's house three weeks together, I never\r\nheard Mr. Bayley read a[i.252] chapter, nor expound on any part of the\r\nScripture, which was a great grief to me.\" On the other hand, three men\r\nand one woman depose thus: \"Having, for a year, some more, some less,\r\nsince Mr. Bayley's coming to Salem Farms, lived at his house, we\r\ntestify to our knowledge, that he hath continually performed family\r\nduties, morning and evening, unless sickness or some other unavoidable\r\nprovidence hath prevented.\" Two of the above witnesses depose more\r\nspecifically as follows: \"We testify,—one of us being a boarder at Mr.\r\nBayley's house, at times, for two or three years, and the other having\r\nlived there about a year and a quarter,—that Mr. Bayley did not only\r\nconstantly perform family prayers twice a day, except some unusual\r\nprovidence at any time prevented, but also did sometimes read the\r\nScriptures and other profitable books, and also repeat his own sermons\r\nin his family that he preached upon the Lord's Days; always endeavoring\r\nto keep good order in his family, carrying himself exemplarily\r\ntherein.\" The evidence against Bayley was afterwards found to be\r\nunworthy of credit, and was wholly overborne at the time by\r\nunimpeachable testimony in his favor. The conclusion seems to be safe,\r\nfrom all the papers and proceedings, that Mr. Bayley was, as the\r\nGeneral Court had pronounced him, \"of a blameless conversation.\" A\r\nletter from him to his people, relating to the disaffection of some,\r\nand expressing a willingness to relinquish his position, if the\r\ninterests of the society would thereby be promoted, is among the\r\npapers. It[i.253] is creditable to his understanding, temper, and\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe opposition to Mr. Bayley laid the train for all the disastrous and\r\nterrible scenes that followed. His wife was Mary Carr, of Salisbury.\r\nHer family, besides land in that town, owned the large island in the\r\nMerrimack, just above Newburyport, called still by their name, and\r\noccupied by their descendants to this day. Mrs. Bayley brought with her\r\nto the village a younger sister, Ann, who, when scarcely sixteen years\r\nof age,—on the 25th of November, 1678,—married Sergeant Thomas Putnam.\r\nThe Carrs were evidently well-educated young women; and there is every\r\nindication that Ann was possessed of qualities which gave her much\r\ninfluence in private circles. Her husband was the eldest son of the\r\nrichest man in the village, had the most powerful and extensive\r\nconnections, was a member of the company of troopers, had been in the\r\nNarragansett fight, and, as his records show, was a well-educated\r\nperson. Marriage with him brought his wife into the centre of the great\r\nPutnam family; and, her sister Bayley being the wife of the minister, a\r\npowerful combination was secured to his support. The opposition so\r\nobstinately made to his settlement, appearing to his friends, as it\r\ndoes to us, so unreasonable, if not perverse, engendered a very bitter\r\nresentment, which spread from house to house. Every thing served to\r\naggravate it. The disregard, by the opposition, of the advice of the\r\nold church to agree to his ordination, and of the strong[i.254]\r\nendorsement of him by the General Court; and the failure of either of\r\nthose bodies to take the responsibility of proceeding to his\r\nordination,—made the dissatisfaction and disappointment of his friends\r\nintense. His connection by marriage with such a wide-spread influence,\r\nand the harmony and happiness of social life, made his settlement so\r\nvery desirable that his friends could not account for the resistance\r\nmade to it. His amiable character, which had been shown to be proof\r\nagainst slander; and his domestic bereavements in the loss of his wife\r\nand three children,—made him dear to his friends. More than three to\r\none earnestly, persistently, from year to year, begged that he might be\r\nordained; but what was regarded as an unworthy faction was permitted to\r\nsucceed in preventing it. All these things sunk deep into the heart of\r\nthe wife of Sergeant Thomas Putnam. She was a woman of an excitable\r\ntemperament, and, by her talents, zeal, and personal qualities, wrought\r\nall within her influence into the highest state of exasperation. This\r\nmust be borne in mind when we reach the details of our story. It is the\r\nkey to all that followed.\r\n\r\nThe friends of Bayley, while they yielded to his determination to\r\nwithdraw from his disagreeable position, never relinquished the hope to\r\nget him back, but renewed a struggle to that end, whenever a vacancy\r\noccurred in the village ministry. With that object in view, they were\r\nunwise and unjust enough to cherish aversion to every one who succeeded\r\nhim, and thus kept alive the fatal elements of division. But it is due\r\nto[i.255] him to say, that he does not appear to have been at all\r\nresponsible for the course of his friends. Although retaining his\r\nproperty in the village, and often residing there, there is no\r\nindication that he had a hand in subsequent proceedings, or was in the\r\nslightest degree connected with the troubles that afterwards arose.\r\nArts were used to inveigle him into the witchcraft prosecutions: his\r\nresentments, if he had any, were invoked; but in vain. He resisted\r\nattempts, which were made with more effect upon one of his successors,\r\nto rouse his passions against parties accused. He kept himself free\r\nfrom the whole affair. His name nowhere appears as complainant,\r\nwitness, or actor in any shape. He was, so far as the evidence goes, a\r\npeaceable, prudent, kind, and good man; and if the people of Salem\r\nVillage had been wise enough, or been permitted, to settle him, the\r\nworld might never have known that such a place existed.\r\n\r\nGeorge Burroughs, in November, 1680, was engaged to preach at Salem\r\nVillage. He is supposed to have been born in Scituate; but his origin\r\nis as uncertain as his history was sad, and his end tragical. He was a\r\ngraduate of Harvard College in the class of 1670. What little is known\r\nof him shows that he was a man of ability and integrity. Papers on file\r\nin the State House prove, that, in the district of Maine, where he\r\nlived and preached before and after his settlement at the village, he\r\nwas regarded with confidence by his neighbors, and looked up to as a\r\nfriend and counsellor. Certain incidents are related, which prove that\r\nhe was[i.256] self-denying, generous, and public-spirited, laboring in\r\nhumility and with zeal in the midst of great privations, sharing the\r\nexposures of his people to Indian violence, and experiencing all the\r\nsufferings of an unprotected outpost. In 1676, while preaching at\r\nCasco,—now Portland,—the entire settlement was broken up by an Indian\r\nassault. Thirty-two of the inhabitants were killed or carried into\r\ncaptivity. Mr. Burroughs escaped to an island in the bay, from which he\r\nwas rescued by timely aid from the mainland. He wrote an account of the\r\ncatastrophe, communicated by Brian Pendleton to the Governor and\r\nCouncil at Boston. In 1683 he was again at Casco; and, again driven off\r\nby the Indians in 1690, transferred his labors to Wells. A grant of one\r\nhundred and fifty acres of land was made to him, included in the site\r\nof the present city of Portland. As population began to thicken near\r\nthe spot, the town applied to him to relinquish a part of it, other\r\nlands to be given him in exchange. In their account of the transaction,\r\nthey state, that, in answer to their application, Mr. Burroughs said\r\nthey were welcome to it; that he freely gave it back, \"not desiring any\r\nland anywhere else, nor any thing else in consideration thereof.\"\r\n\r\nIn a vote passed at a meeting of Salem Village parish, Feb. 10, 1681,\r\nit was agreed that Mr. Burroughs should receive £93. 6_s._ 8_d._ per\r\nannum for three years, and £60 per annum afterwards. I suppose that he\r\nhad no money or property of any kind. The parsonage was out of repair;\r\nand the larger sum for the first[i.257] three years, amounting to £100,\r\nin three instalments, was to be given him as an outfit in housekeeping.\r\nImmediately upon coming to the village to reside, he encountered the\r\nhostility of those persons who, as the special friends of Mr. Bayley,\r\nallowed their prejudices to be concentrated upon his innocent\r\nsuccessor. The unhappy animosities arising from this source entirely\r\ndemoralized the Society, and, besides making it otherwise very\r\nuncomfortable to a minister, led to a neglect and derangement of all\r\nfinancial affairs. In September, 1681, Mr. Burroughs's wife died, and\r\nhe had to run in debt for her funeral expenses. Rates were not\r\ncollected, and his salary was in arrears. In making the contract with\r\nthe parish, he had taken care to add, at the end of the articles, these\r\nwords, \"All is to be understood so long as I have gospel\r\nencouragement.\" It is not improbable that there was a lack of sympathy\r\nbetween him and the ministers in this part of the country. He concluded\r\nthat no benefit would accrue from calling a council to put things into\r\norder; and, as he was in despair of remedying the evils that had become\r\nfastened upon the village, he concluded to give up the idea of getting\r\na settlement of his accounts, abandoned his claims altogether, and\r\nremoved from the village.\r\n\r\nAt the April term of Court in Ipswich, 1683, a committee of the parish\r\npetitioned for relief, stating that Mr. Burroughs had left them, and\r\nthat they had been without services in their meeting-house for four\r\nsabbaths. They pray the Court, that \"they be pleased to[i.258] write to\r\nMr. Burroughs, requiring him to attend an orderly hearing and clearing\r\nup the case,\" and \"to come to account\" with them. The Court accordingly\r\ndirected a meeting of the inhabitants to be held, and wrote to Mr.\r\nBurroughs to attend it. When the day came, the Court sent a letter to\r\nbe read at the meeting, directing the parties to \"reckon,\" and settle\r\ntheir accounts. What transpired at this curious meeting is best given\r\nby presenting the documents on file in a case that went into Court.\r\nThey show the proceedings that interrupted the \"reckoning\" at the\r\nmeeting in a most extraordinary manner:—\r\n\r\n[County Court, June, 1683.—Lieutenant John Putnam _versus_ Mr. George\r\nBurroughs. Action of debt for two gallons of Canary wine, and cloth,\r\n&c., bought of Mr. Gedney on John Putnam's account, for the funeral of\r\nMrs. Burroughs.]\r\n\r\n\"_Deposition_.\r\n\r\n\"We, whose names are underwritten, testify and say, that at a public\r\nmeeting of the people of Salem Farms, April 24, 1683, we heard a letter\r\nread, which letter was sent from the Court. After the said letter was\r\nread, Mr. Burroughs came in. After the said Burroughs had been a while\r\nin, he asked 'whether they took up with the advice of the Court, given\r\nin the letter, or whether they rejected it.' The moderator made answer,\r\n'Yes, we take up with it;' and not a man contradicted it to any of our\r\nhearing. After this was passed, was a discourse of settling accounts\r\nbetween the said Burroughs and the inhabitants, and issuing things in\r\npeace, and parting in love, as they came together in love. Further, we\r\nsay that the second, third, and fourth days of the following week were\r\nagreed upon by Mr. Burroughs and[i.259] the people to be the days for\r\nevery man to come in and to reckon with the said Burroughs; and so they\r\nadjourned the meeting to the last of the aforesaid three days, in the\r\nafternoon, then to make up the whole account in public.\r\n\r\n\"We further testify and say, that, May the second, 1683, Mr. Burroughs\r\nand the inhabitants met at the meeting-house to make up accounts in\r\npublic, according to their agreement the meeting before; and, just as\r\nthe said Burroughs began to give in his accounts, the marshal came in,\r\nand, after a while, went up to John Putnam, Sr., and whispered to him,\r\nand said Putnam said to him, 'You know what you have to do: do your\r\noffice.' Then the marshal came to Mr. Burroughs, and said, 'Sir, I have\r\na writing to read to you.' Then he read the attachment, and demanded\r\ngoods. Mr. Burroughs answered, 'that he had no goods to show, and that\r\nhe was now reckoning with the inhabitants, for we know not yet who is\r\nin debt, but there was his body.' As we were ready to go out of the\r\nmeeting-house, Mr. Burroughs said, 'Well, what will you do with me?'\r\nThen the marshal went to John Putnam, Sr., and said to him, 'What shall\r\nI do?' The said Putnam replied, 'You know your business.' And then the\r\nsaid Putnam went to his brother, Thomas Putnam, and pulled him by the\r\ncoat; and they went out of the house together, and presently came in\r\nagain. Then said John Putnam, 'Marshal, take your prisoner, and have\r\nhim up to the ordinary,—that is a public house,—and secure him till the\r\nmorning.'\r\n\r\n(Signed) \"Nathaniel Ingersoll, aged about fifty.\r\nSamuel Sibley, aged about twenty-four.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To the first of these, I, John Putnam, Jr., testify, being at the\r\nmeeting.\" [i.260]\r\n\r\nThe above document illustrates the general position of the Putnam\r\nfamily through all the troubles of the Salem Village parish. Thomas and\r\nJohn were the heads of two of its branches, and participated in the\r\nproceedings against Burroughs. Nathaniel generally was on the other\r\nside in the course of the various controversies which finally\r\nculminated in the witchcraft delusion. His son, John Putnam, Jr., on\r\nthis occasion, was a witness friendly to Mr. Burroughs. Nathaniel\r\nIngersoll does not appear to have been a partisan on either side. His\r\nsympathies, generally, were with the friends of Bayley; but, on this\r\noccasion, his sense of justice led him to take the lead in behalf of\r\nBurroughs. Other depositions are as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"The Testimony of Thomas Haynes, aged thirty-two years or\r\nthereabouts.—Testifieth and saith, that, at a meeting of the\r\ninhabitants of Salem Farms, May the second, 1683, after the marshal had\r\nread John Putnam's attachment to Mr. Burroughs, then Mr. Burroughs\r\nasked Putnam 'what money it was he attached him for.' John Putnam\r\nanswered, 'For five pounds and odd money at Shippen's at Boston, and\r\nfor thirteen shillings at his father Gedney's, and for twenty-four\r\nshillings at Mrs. Darby's;' that then Nathaniel Ingersoll stood up, and\r\nsaid, 'Lieutenant, I wonder that you attach Mr. Burroughs for the money\r\nat Darby's and your father Gedney's, when, to my knowledge, you and Mr.\r\nBurroughs have reckoned and balanced accounts two or three times since,\r\nas you say, it was due, and you never made any mention of it when you\r\nreckoned with Mr. Burroughs.' John Putnam answered, 'It is true, and I\r\nown it.'[i.261] Samuel Sibley, aged twenty-four years or thereabouts,\r\ntestifieth to all above written.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Testimony of Nathaniel Ingersoll, _aged, &c._—Testifieth, that I\r\nheard Mr. Burroughs ask Lieutenant John Putnam to give him a bill to\r\nMr. Shippen. The said Putnam asked the said Burroughs how much he would\r\ntake up at Mr. Shippen's. Mr. Burroughs said it might be five pounds;\r\nbut, after the said Burroughs had considered a little, he said to the\r\nsaid Putnam, 'It may be it might come to more:' therefore he would have\r\nhim give him a bill to the value of five or six pounds,—when Putnam\r\nanswered, it was all one to him. Then the said Putnam went and writ it,\r\nand read it to Mr. Burroughs, and said to him that it should go for\r\npart of the £33. 6_s._ 8_d._ for which he had given a bill to him in\r\nbehalf of the inhabitants. I, Hannah Ingersoll, aged forty-six years or\r\nthereabouts, testify the same.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems by the foregoing, that Mr. Burroughs had presented a bill, of\r\nthe amount just mentioned, to John Putnam, who, as chairman of the\r\ncommittee the preceding year, represented the inhabitants; and it was\r\ndeliberately and formally agreed, that the sum borrowed of Putnam by\r\nBurroughs should \"go for part of it.\" The records of the parish show,\r\nthat, on the 24th of May,—three weeks after this meeting \"for\r\nreckoning,\"—a vote was passed to raise, by a rate, \"fifteen pounds for\r\nMr. Burroughs for the last quarter of a year he preached with us.\" At a\r\nmeeting in December of the same year, a rate was ordered, to pay the\r\ndebts of the parish, amounting to £52. 1_s._ 1_d._ On the 22d of the\r\nensuing February, the parish voted to raise \"fifteen pounds for Mr.\r\nBurroughs.\"[i.262] The record of a meeting in April, 1684, contains an\r\norder, left on the book, with Mr. Burroughs's proper signature,\r\nauthorizing Lieutenant Thomas Putnam to receive of the committee \"what\r\nis due to me from the inhabitants of Salem Farms.\" Thus it is evident,\r\nthat, at the very day when the ruthless proceedings above described\r\ntook place, a considerable balance was due to Mr. Burroughs, after all\r\nclaims from all quarters had been \"reckoned.\" The return of the\r\nmarshal, made to the Court, was as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"I have attached the body of George Burroughs he tendered to me,—for he\r\nsaid he had no pay,—and taken bonds to the value of fourteen pounds\r\nmoney, and read this to him.\r\n\r\nPer me,\r\n\r\nHenry Skerry, _Marshal_.\"\r\n\r\nThe bond is as follows. I give the names of the signers. The persons\r\nwho interposed to rescue a persecuted man from unjust imprisonment\r\ndeserve to be held in honored remembrance.\r\n\r\n\"We whose names are underwritten do bind ourselves jointly and\r\nseverally to Henry Skerry, Marshal of Salem, our heirs, executors, and\r\nadministrators, in the sum of fourteen pounds money, that George\r\nBurroughs shall appear at the next court at Salem, to answer to\r\nLieutenant John Putnam, according to the summons of this attachment,\r\nand to abide the order of the court therein, and not to depart without\r\nlicense; as witness our hands this 2d of May, 1683.\r\n\r\n\"George Burroughs.\r\nNathaniel Ingersoll.\r\nJohn Buxton.\r\nThomas Haynes.\r\nSamuel Sibley.\r\nWilliam Sibley.\r\nWilliam Ireland, Jr.\"\r\n\r\n[i.263]\r\n\r\nThe case was withdrawn, and Burroughs was glad to get away. He\r\npreferred the Indians at Casco Bay to the people here. When we\r\nconsider, that a committee of the parish petitioned the Court to have\r\nsuch a meeting of the inhabitants; that it was held, by an order of\r\nCourt, in compliance with said petition; that Burroughs came back to\r\nthe village to attend it; that the meeting agreed, in answer to an\r\ninquiry from him to that effect, to conform to the order of the Court\r\nin making it the occasion of a full and final \"reckoning\" between them;\r\nthat they spent two days and a half in bringing in and sifting all\r\nclaims on either side; and that, when, at the time agreed upon,—the\r\nafternoon of the third day,—the whole body of the inhabitants had come\r\ntogether to ratify and give effect to the \"reckoning,\" the marshal came\r\nin with a writ, and, evidently in violation of his feelings, was forced\r\nby John Putnam to arrest Burroughs, thereby breaking up the proceedings\r\nasked for by the parish and ordered by the Court, for a debt which he\r\ndid not owe,—it must be allowed, that it was one of the most audacious\r\nand abominable outrages ever committed.\r\n\r\nThe scene presented in these documents is perhaps as vivid, and brings\r\nthe actual life before us as strikingly, as any thing that has come\r\ndown to us from that day. We can see, as though we were looking in at\r\nthe door, the spectacle presented in the old meeting-house: the farmers\r\ngathered from their remote and widely scattered plantations, some\r\npossibly coming in travelling family-vehicles,—although it is\r\nquite[i.264] uncertain whether there were any at that time among the\r\nfarmers; some in companies on farm-carts; many on foot; but the greater\r\nnumber on horseback, in their picturesque costume of homespun or\r\nmoose-skin, with cowl-shaped hoods, or hats with a brim, narrow in\r\nfront, but broad and slouching behind, hanging over the shoulders.\r\nEvery man was belted and sworded. They did not wear weapons merely for\r\nshow. There was half a score of men in that assembly who were in the\r\nNarragansett fight; and some bore on their persons scars from that\r\nbloody scene of desperate heroism. Every man, it is probable, had come\r\nto the meeting with his firelock on his shoulder, to defend himself and\r\ncompanions against Indians lurking in the thick woods through which\r\nthey had to pass. Their countenances bespoke the passions to which they\r\nhad been wrought up by their fierce parish quarrels,—rugged, severe,\r\nand earnest. We can see the grim bearing of the cavalry lieutenant,\r\nJohn Putnam, and of his elder brother and predecessor in commission.\r\nMarshal Skerry, with his badges of office, is reluctant to execute its\r\nfunctions upon a persecuted and penniless minister; but, in accordance\r\nwith the stern demands of the inexorable prosecutors, is faithful still\r\nto his painful duty. The minister is the central object in the\r\npicture,—a small, dark-complexioned man, the amazed but calm and\r\npatient victim of an animosity in which he had no part, and for which\r\nhe was in no wise responsible. The unresisting dignity of his bearing\r\nis quite observable. \"We are now reckoning; we know not[i.265] yet who\r\nis in debt. I have no pay; but here is my body.\" Perhaps, in that\r\nunconspicuous frame, and through that humble garb, the sinewy nerves\r\nand muscles of steel, the compact and concentrated forces, that were\r\nthe marvel of his times, and finally cost him his life, were apparent\r\nin his movements and attitudes. It may be, that the sufferings and\r\nexposures of his previous life had left upon his swarthy features a\r\nstamp of care and melancholy, foreshadowing the greater wrongs and\r\ntrials in store for him. But the chief figure in the group is the just\r\nman who rose and rebuked the harsh and reprehensible procedure of the\r\npowerful landholder, neighbor and friend though he was. The manner in\r\nwhich the arbitrary trooper bowed to the rebuke, if it does not\r\nmitigate our resentment of his conduct, illustrates the extraordinary\r\ninfluence of Nathaniel Ingersoll's character, and demonstrates the\r\ndeference in which all men held him.\r\n\r\nThere are in this affair other points worthy of notice, as showing the\r\neffects of their bitter feuds in rendering them insensible to every\r\nappeal of charity or humanity. Their minds had become so soured, and\r\ntheir sense of what was right so impaired, that they neglected and\r\nrefused to fulfil their most ordinary obligations to each other, and to\r\nthemselves as a society. Rates were not collected, and contracts were\r\nnot complied with. The minister and his family were left without the\r\nnecessaries of life. They were compelled to borrow even their clothing,\r\narticles of which constituted a part of the debt for which he was\r\narrested in such a[i.266] public and unfeeling manner. A young woman\r\ntestifies that she lived with Mr. Burroughs about two years, and says:\r\n\"My mistress did tell me that she had some serge of John Putnam's wife,\r\nto make Mary a coat; and also some fustian of his wife, to make my\r\nmistress a pair of sleeves.\" The principal items in the account were\r\nfor articles required at the death of his wife, by the usages of that\r\nday on funeral occasions. Surely it was an outrage upon human nature to\r\nspring a suit at law and have a writ served on him, and take him as a\r\nprisoner, on such an occasion, under such circumstances, on an alleged\r\ndebt incurred by such a bereavement, when poverty and necessity had\r\nleft him no alternative. The whole procedure receives the stamp, not\r\nonly of cruelty, but of infamy, from the fact, which Nathaniel\r\nIngersoll compelled Putnam to acknowledge before the whole\r\ncongregation, that the account had been settled and the debt paid long\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nJohn Putnam, although a hard and stern man, had many traits of dignity\r\nand respectability in his character. That he could have done this\r\nthing, in this way, proves the extent to which prejudice and passion\r\nmay carry one, particularly where party spirit consumes individual\r\nreason and conscience. At this point it is well to consider a piece of\r\ntestimony brought against Burroughs nine years afterwards. There was no\r\npropriety or sense in giving it when it was adduced. It was, in truth,\r\nan outrage to have introduced such testimony in a case where\r\nBurroughs[i.267] was on trial for witchcraft; and it was allowed, only\r\nto prejudice and mislead the minds of a jury and of the public. But it\r\nis proper to be taken into view, in forming a just estimate, with an\r\nimpartial aim, of his general character. The document is found in a\r\npromiscuous bundle of witchcraft papers.\r\n\r\n\"The Deposition of John Putnam and Rebecca his Wife.—Testifieth and\r\nsaith, that, in the year 1680, Mr. Burroughs lived in our house nine\r\nmonths. There being a great difference betwixt said Burroughs and his\r\nwife, the difference was so great that they did desire us, the\r\ndeponents, to come into their room to hear their difference. The\r\ncontroversy that was betwixt them was, that the aforesaid Burroughs did\r\nrequire his wife to give him a written covenant, under her hand and\r\nseal, that she would never reveal his secrets. Our answer was, that\r\nthey had once made a covenant we did conceive did bind each other to\r\nkeep their lawful secrets. And further saith, that, all the time that\r\nsaid Burroughs did live at our house, he was a very harsh and sharp man\r\nto his wife; notwithstanding, to our observation, she was a very good\r\nand dutiful wife to him.\"\r\n\r\nThe first observation that occurs in examining this piece of testimony\r\nis, that the answer made by Putnam and his wife was excellent, and,\r\nlike every thing from him, shows that he was a man of strong common\r\nsense, and had a forcible and effectual way of expressing himself. The\r\nnext thing to be considered is, that Mr. Burroughs probably discovered,\r\nsoon after coming to the village, into what a hornets' nest he had\r\ngot,[i.268]—every one tattling about and backbiting each other. His\r\ninnocent and unsuspicious wife may have indulged a little in what is\r\nconsidered the amiable proclivity of her sex, and have let fall, in\r\ntea-table talk, what cavillers and mischief-makers were on hand to take\r\nup; and he may have found it both necessary and difficult to teach her\r\ncaution and reserve. He saw, more perhaps than she did, the danger of\r\ngetting involved in the personal acrimonies with which the whole\r\ncommunity was poisoned. Her unguarded carelessness might get herself\r\nand him into trouble, and vitally impair their happiness and his\r\nusefulness. The only other point to be remarked upon is the general\r\ncharge against Mr. Burroughs's temper and disposition. It may be that\r\nhe became so disgusted with the state of things as to have shown some\r\nacerbity in his manners, but such a supposition is not in harmony with\r\nwhat little is known of him from other sources; and John Putnam's\r\nconduct at the meeting described proves that his mind was fully\r\nperverted, and bereft as it were of all moral rectitude of judgment, in\r\nreference to Mr. Burroughs. We must part with Mr. Burroughs for the\r\npresent. We shall meet him again, where the powers of malignity will be\r\nmore shamelessly let loose upon him, and prevail to his destruction.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded in the ministry at Salem Village by a character of a\r\ntotally different class. Deodat Lawson is first heard of in this\r\ncountry, according to Mr. Savage, at Martha's Vineyard in 1671. He took\r\nthe freeman's oath at Boston in 1680, and continued[i.269] to have his\r\nresidence there. It was not until after much negotiation and\r\nconsiderable importunity, that he was prevailed upon to enter into an\r\nengagement to preach at the Village. He began his ministry early in\r\n1684, as appears by the parish record of a meeting Feb. 22, 1684:\r\n\"Voted that Joseph Herrick, Jonathan Putnam, and Goodman Cloyse are\r\ndesired to take care for to get a boat for the removing of Mr. Lawson's\r\ngoods.\" Votes, about this time, were passed to repair the parsonage,\r\nand the fences around the ministry land; thus putting things in\r\nreadiness to receive him. It does not appear that he became\r\nparticularly entangled in the conflicts which had so long disturbed the\r\nVillage, although, while the mother-church signified its readiness to\r\napprove of his ordination, and some movement was made in the Village to\r\nthat end, it was found impossible to bring the hostile parties\r\nsufficiently into co-operation to allow of any thing being definitely\r\naccomplished. Fortunately for Mr. Lawson, the spirit of strife found\r\nother objects upon which to expend its energies for the time being.\r\nSome persons brought forward complaints, that the records of the parish\r\nhad not been correctly kept (this was before Sergeant Thomas Putnam had\r\nbeen charged with that trust); that votes which had passed in \"Mr.\r\nBayley's days\" and in \"Mr. Burroughs's days\" had not been truly\r\nrecorded, or recorded at all; and that what had never been passed had\r\nbeen entered as votes. A great agitation arose on this subject, and\r\nmany meetings were held. Some demanded that the[i.270] spurious votes\r\nshould be expunged; others, that the omitted votes should be inserted.\r\nThen there was an excited disputation about the ministry lands, and the\r\nvalidity or sufficiency of their title to them. Joseph Houlton had\r\ngiven them; but he had nothing to do with raising the question, and did\r\nall he could to suppress it. Some person had discovered that William\r\nHaynes, to whom Houlton had succeeded by the right of his wife, had\r\nomitted to get his deed of purchase recorded, and the original could\r\nnot be found. Disputes also arose about the use of the grounds around\r\nthe meeting-house. These, added to the conflicts with the \"Topsfield\r\nmen,\" and matters not fully adjusted with the town of Salem, created\r\nand kept up a violent fermentation, in which all were miscellaneously\r\ninvolved. In the midst of this confusion, the matter of ordaining Mr.\r\nLawson was put into the warrant for a meeting to be held on the 10th of\r\nDecember, 1686. But it was found impossible to recall the people from\r\ntheir divisions, and no favorable action could be had.\r\n\r\nAt length, all attempts to settle their difficulties among themselves\r\nwere abandoned; and they called for help from outside. At a legally\r\nwarned meeting on the 17th of January, 1687, the inhabitants made\r\nchoice of \"Captain John Putnam\" (he had been promoted in the military\r\nline since the affair in the meeting-house with Mr. Burroughs),\r\n\"Lieutenant Jonathan Walcot, Ensign Thomas Flint, and Corporal Joseph\r\nHerrick, for to transact with Joseph Hutchinson, Job Swinnerton, Joseph\r\nPorter, and Daniel An[i.271]drew about their grievances relating to the\r\npublic affairs of this place; and, if they cannot agree among\r\nthemselves, that then they shall refer their differences to the Honored\r\nMajor Gedney and John Hathorne, Esqs., and to the reverend elders of\r\nthe Salem Church, for a full determination of those differences.\" Of\r\ncourse, it was impossible to settle the matter among themselves, and\r\nthe referees were called in. William Brown, Jr., Esq., was added to\r\nthem. They were all of the old town, and men of the highest\r\nconsideration. Their judgment in the case is a well-drawn and\r\ninteresting document, and shows the view which near neighbors took of\r\nthe distractions in the village. The following passage will exhibit the\r\npurport and spirit of it:—\r\n\r\n\"_Loving Brethren, Friends and Neighbors_,—Upon serious consideration\r\nof, and mature deliberation upon, what hath been offered to us about\r\nyour calling and transacting in order to the settling and ordaining the\r\nRev. Mr. Deodat Lawson, and the grievances offered by some to obstruct\r\nand impede that proceeding, our sense of the matter is this,—first,\r\nthat the affair of calling and transacting in order to the settling and\r\nordaining the Reverend Mr. Lawson hath not been so inoffensively\r\nmanaged as might have been,—at least, not in all the parts and passages\r\nof it; second, that the grievances offered by some amongst you are not\r\nin themselves of sufficient weight to obstruct so great a work, and\r\nthat they have not been improved so peaceably and orderly as Christian\r\nprudence and self-denial doth direct; third, to our grief, we observe\r\nsuch uncharitable expressions and uncomely reflections tossed to and\r\nfro as look like the effects[i.272] of settled prejudice and resolved\r\nanimosity, though we are much rather willing to account them the\r\nproduct of weakness than wilfulness: however, we must needs say, that,\r\ncome whence they will, they have a tendency to make such a gap as we\r\nfear, if not timely prevented, will let out peace and order, and let in\r\nconfusion and every evil work.\"\r\n\r\nThey then proceed to give some good advice to \"prevent contention and\r\ntrouble for the future, that it may not devour for ever, and that, if\r\nthe Lord please, you may be happier henceforth than to make one another\r\nmiserable; and not make your place uncomfortable to your present, and\r\nundesirable to any other, minister, and the ministry itself in a great\r\nmeasure unprofitable: and that you may not bring impositions on\r\nyourselves by convincing all about you that you cannot, or will not,\r\nuse your liberty as becomes the gospel.\" Their advice is, \"that you\r\ndesist, at present, from urging the ordination of the Rev. Mr. Lawson,\r\ntill your spirits are better quieted and composed.\" They give some\r\njudicious suggestions about various matters that had been the occasion\r\nof difficulty among them, especially to help them get their records put\r\ninto good shape, and kept so for the future; and wind up in the\r\nfollowing excellent, and in some of the clauses rather emphatic and\r\npithy, expressions:—\r\n\r\n\"Finally, we think peace cheap, if it may be procured by complying with\r\nthe aforementioned particulars, which are few, fair, and easy; and that\r\nthey will hardly pass for lovers of peace, truth, ministry, and order,\r\nin the day of the Lord,[i.273] that shall so lean to their own\r\nunderstanding and will that they shall refuse such easy methods for the\r\nobtaining of them. And, if peace and agreement amongst you be once\r\ncomfortably obtained, we advise you with all convenient speed to go on\r\nwith your intended ordination; and so we shall follow our advice with\r\nour prayers. But, if our advice be rejected, we wish you better, and\r\nhearts to follow it; and only add, if you will unreasonably trouble\r\nyourselves, we pray you not any further to trouble us. We leave all to\r\nthe blessing of God, the wonderful Counsellor, and your own serious\r\nconsideration: praying you to read and consider the whole, and then act\r\nas God shall direct you. Farewell.\"\r\n\r\n[Salem, Feb. 14, 1687. Signed by the five referees,—John Higginson and\r\nNicholas Noyes (the elders of the old church), and the three gentlemen\r\nbefore named.]\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the inhabitants of the Village on the 18th of February,\r\nit was voted that \"we do accept of and embrace the advice of the\r\nhonored and reverend gentlemen of Salem, sent to us under their hands,\r\nand order that it shall be entered on our book of records.\" But they\r\ntook care further to vote, that they accepted it \"in general, and not\r\nin parts.\" In accordance with the advice of the referees, they brought\r\nup, considered anew, and put to question, every entry in their past\r\nrecords about the genuineness and validity of which any division of\r\nopinion existed. Some entries that had been complained of and given\r\noffence as incorrect were voted out, and others were confirmed by being\r\nadopted on a new vote. A new book of records was[i.274] prepared, to\r\nconform to these decisions, which, having been submitted for\r\nexamination to leading persons, appointed for the purpose at a legal\r\nmeeting representing both parties, and approved by them, was adopted\r\nand sanctioned at a subsequent meeting also called for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the same advice \"that the old book of records be\r\nkept in being,\" it was ordered by the meeting to leave the votes that\r\nhad, by the foregoing proceedings, been rendered null and void, to \"lie\r\nin the old book of records as they are.\" From the new book of records\r\nwe learn that \"some votes are left out that passed in Mr. Bayley's\r\ndays, and some that passed in Mr. Burroughs's days,\" particularly all\r\nthe votes but one that passed at a meeting held on the fifth day of\r\nJune, 1683, the very time that Mr. Burroughs was under bonds in the\r\naction of debt brought by John Putnam. The new record specifies some\r\nfew, but not all, of the votes that were rescinded because it was\r\nadjudged that they had not rightfully passed, or been correctly stated.\r\nUnfortunately, the old book, after all, has not been \"kept in being;\"\r\nand much that would have exhibited more fully and clearly the unhappy\r\nearly history of the parish is for ever lost. If the records that have\r\nbeen suffered to remain present the picture I have endeavored\r\nfaithfully to draw, how much darker might have been its shades had we\r\nbeen permitted to behold what the parties concerned concurred in\r\nthinking too bad to be left to view!\r\n\r\nThe attempt to expunge records is always indefensi[i.275]ble, besides\r\nbeing in itself irrational and absurd. It may cover up the details of\r\nwrong and folly; but it leaves an unlimited range to the most\r\nunfriendly conjecture. We are compelled to imagine what we ought to be\r\nallowed to know; and, in many particulars, our fancies may be worse\r\nthan the facts. But later times, and public bodies of greater\r\npretensions than \"the inhabitants of Salem Village,\" have attempted,\r\nand succeeded in perpetrating, this outrage upon history. In trying to\r\nconceal their errors, men have sometimes destroyed the means of their\r\nvindication. This may be the case with the story that is to be told of\r\n\"Salem Witchcraft.\" It has been the case in reference to wider fields\r\nof history. The Parliamentary journals and other public records of the\r\nperiod of the Commonwealth and the Protectorate were suppressed by the\r\ninfatuated stupidity of the Government of the Restoration. They\r\nfoolishly imagined that they were hiding the shame, while they were\r\nobscuring the glory, of their country. Every Englishman, every\r\nintelligent man, now knows, that, during that very period, all that has\r\nmade England great was done. The seeds of her naval and maritime\r\nprosperity were planted: and she was pushed at once by wise measures of\r\npolicy, internal and external; by legislation developing her resources\r\nand invigorating the power of her people; by a decisive and\r\ncomprehensive diplomacy that commanded the respect of foreign courts,\r\nand secured to her a controlling influence upon the traffic of the\r\nworld; by developments of her military genius under[i.276] the greatest\r\nof all the great generals of modern times; and by naval achievements\r\nthat snatched into her hands the balancing trident of the seas,—to the\r\nplace she still holds (how much longer she may hold it remains to be\r\nseen) as the leading power of the world. If she has to relinquish that\r\nposition, it will only be to a power that is true to the spirit, and is\r\nnot ashamed of the name, of a republic. The nation that fully develops\r\nthe policy which pervaded the records of the English Commonwealth will\r\nbe the leader of the world. The suppression of those records has not\r\nsuppressed the spirit of popular liberty, or the progress of mankind in\r\nthe path of reform, freedom, equal rights, and a true civilization. It\r\nhas only cast a shadow, which can never wholly be dispelled, over what\r\notherwise would have been the brightest page in the annals of a great\r\npeople. We depend for our knowledge of the steps by which England then\r\nmade a most wonderful stride to prosperity and power, not upon official\r\nand authoritative records, but upon the desultory and sometimes merely\r\ngossiping memoirs of particular persons, and such other miscellaneous\r\nmaterials as can be picked up. The only consequence of an attempt to\r\nextinguish the memory of republicans, radicals, reformers, and\r\nregicides has been, that the history of England's true glory can never\r\nbe adequately written.\r\n\r\nThe referees used the following language touching the point of the\r\nordination of Mr. Lawson: \"If more than a mere major part should not\r\nconsent to it, we[i.277] should be loath to advise our brethren to\r\nproceed.\" This, in connection with the other sentence I have quoted\r\nfrom their communication recommending them \"to desist at present\" from\r\nurging it, was fatal to the immediate movement in his favor; and, not\r\nseeing any prospect of their \"spirits becoming better quieted and\r\ncomposed,\" and weary of the attempt to bring them to any comfortable\r\ndegree of unanimity, Mr. Lawson threw up his connection with them, and\r\nremoved back to Boston. We shall meet him again; but it is well to\r\ndespatch at this point what is to be said of his character and history.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Deodat Lawson had received the best education of his\r\nday. It is not easy to account for his not having left a more\r\ndistinguished mark in Old or New England. He had much learning and\r\ngreat talents. Of his power in getting up pulpit performances in the\r\nhighest style of eloquence, of which that period afforded remarkable\r\nspecimens, I shall have occasion to speak. Among his other attainments,\r\nhe was, what cannot be said of learned and professional men generally\r\nnow any more than then, an admirable penman. The village parish adopted\r\nthe practice at the beginning, when paying the salaries of its\r\nministers from time to time, instead of taking receipts on detached and\r\nloose pieces of paper, of having them write them out in their own hand\r\non the pages of the record-book, with their signatures. It is a luxury,\r\nin looking over the old volume, to come upon the receipts of Deodat\r\nLawson, in his plain, round hand.[i.278] A specimen is given among the\r\nautographs. His chirography is easy, free, graceful, clear, and clean.\r\nIt unites with wonderful taste the highest degrees of simplicity and\r\nornament. Each style is used, and both are blended, as occasion\r\nrequired. During his ministry, the trouble about the old record-book\r\noccurred. The first four pages of the new book are in his handwriting.\r\nThe ink has somewhat faded; the paper has become discolored, and,\r\naround the margins and at the bottom of the leaves, lamentably worn and\r\nbroken. The first page exhibits Lawson's penmanship in its various\r\nstyles. It is artistically executed in several sizes of letters,\r\nappropriate to the position of the clauses and the import and weight of\r\nthe matter. In each there is an elegant combination of ornament and\r\nsimplicity. His chirography was often had in requisition; and papers,\r\nevidently from his pen, are on file in various cases, occurring in\r\ncourt at the time, in which his friends were interested.\r\n\r\nThe first four ministers of the village parish were excellent penmen.\r\nBayley's hand is more like the modern style than the rest. Burroughs's\r\nis as legible as print, uniform in its character, open and upright. The\r\nspecimen among the autographs is from the record referred to at the top\r\nof page 262. As it was written at the bottom of a page in the\r\nrecord-book, where there was hardly sufficient room, it had to be in a\r\nslanting line. I give it just as it there appears. Parris wrote three\r\ndifferent hands, all perfectly easy to read. The larger kind was used\r\nwhen signing his[i.281] name to important papers, or in brief entries\r\nof record. The specimen I give is from a receipt in the parish-book,\r\nwhich Thomas Putnam, as clerk, made oath in court, that Parris wrote\r\nand signed in his presence. His notes of examinations of persons\r\ncharged with witchcraft by the committing magistrate, many of which are\r\npreserved, are in his smallest hand, very minute, but always legible.\r\nIn his church-records he uses sometimes a medium hand, and sometimes\r\nthe smallest. The autographs of Townsend Bishop and Thomas Putnam show\r\nthe handwriting that seems to have prevailed among well-educated people\r\nin England at the time of the first settlement of this country. There\r\nwas often a profusion of flourishes that obscured the letters. The\r\ninitial capitals were quite complicated and very curious. The signature\r\nof Thomas Putnam, Jr., exhibits his excellent handwriting.\r\n\r\n[i.279]\r\n\r\nautographs\r\n\r\n\r\n[i.280]\r\n\r\nautographs\r\n\r\n\r\nI have adduced these facts and given these illustrations to show, that,\r\nin this branch of education,—the value and desirableness of which\r\ncannot be overrated,—it is at least an open question, whether we have\r\nmuch ground to boast of being in advance of the first generations of\r\nour ancestors in America. The early ministers of the Salem Village\r\nparish certainly compare, in this particular, favorably with ministers\r\nand professional men, and recording officers generally in public bodies\r\nof all kinds, in later times.\r\n\r\nSergeant Thomas Putnam did not act as clerk of the parish from April,\r\n1687, to April, 1694. A few entries are made by his hand; but the\r\nrecord, very[i.282] meagre and fragmentary, is for the most part made\r\nby others. This is much to be regretted, as the interval covers the\r\nvery period of our history. His time, probably, was taken up, and his\r\nmind wholly engrossed, by an unhappy family difficulty, in which,\r\nduring that period, he was involved. Thomas Putnam Sr. died, as has\r\nbeen stated, in 1686. It was thought, by the children of his first\r\nwife, that the influence of the second wife had been unduly exercised\r\nover him, in his last years, so as to induce him to make a will giving\r\nto her, and her only child by him, Joseph, a very unfair proportion of\r\nhis estate. It was felt by them to be so unjust that they attempted to\r\nbreak the will. The management of the case was confided to Sergeant\r\nThomas Putnam, as the eldest son of the family; and the affair, it may\r\nbe supposed, absorbed his thoughts to such a degree as to render it\r\nnecessary for him to abandon his services as clerk of the parish. The\r\nattempt to set aside the will failed. The circumstances connected with\r\nthe subject disturbed very seriously—perhaps permanently—the happiness\r\nof the whole family, and may have contributed to create the morbid\r\nexcitement which afterwards was so fearfully displayed by the wife of\r\nthe younger Thomas.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Lawson was at the village, he lost his wife and daughter. In\r\n1690, he was again married, to Deborah Allen. He was settled afterwards\r\nover the Second Society in Scituate,—it is singular that our local\r\nhistories do not tell us when, but that we get all we know on the point\r\nfrom a sentence written by the[i.283] pen on a leaf of one of the two\r\nfolio volumes of John Quick's \"Synodicon in Gallia Reformata,\" in the\r\npossession of a gentleman in this country, Henry M. Dexter, who says it\r\nis evidently Quick's autograph. It is in these words: \"For my reverend\r\nand dear brother, Mr. Lawson, minister of the gospel, and pastor of the\r\nchurch of Scituate, in the province of Massachusetts in New England;\r\nfrom the publisher, John Quick, _honoris et amoris ergo_, Aug. 6,\r\n1693.\" In 1696, Mr. Lawson went over to England, merely for a short\r\nvisit, as his people supposed. They heard from him no more. He never\r\nasked a dismission, or communicated with them in any way. In 1698, an\r\necclesiastical council declared them free to settle another minister,\r\nwhich they did in due time. He was, no doubt, alive and in London when,\r\nin 1704, his famous Salem Village sermon was reprinted there. But this\r\nis the last glimpse we have of him. An inscrutable mystery covers the\r\nrest of his history. His manner of leaving the Scituate parish shows\r\nhim to have been an eccentric person, leaves an unfavorable impression\r\nof his character, and is as inexplicable as the only other reference to\r\nhim that has thus far been found. Calamy, in his \"Continuation of the\r\nAccount of Ejected Ministers,\" published in 1727, has a notice of\r\nThomas Lawson, whom he describes as minister of Denton in the county of\r\nNorfolk, educated at Katherine Hall in Cambridge, and afterwards chosen\r\n\"to a fellowship in St. John's. He was a man of parts, but had no good\r\nutterance. He was the[i.284] father of the unhappy Mr. Deodat Lawson,\r\nwho came hither from New England.\" With all his abilities, learning,\r\nand eloquence, he disappears, after the re-publication of his Salem\r\nVillage sermon in London, in the dark, impenetrable cloud of this\r\nexpression, \"the unhappy Mr. Deodat Lawson.\" Of the melancholy fate\r\nimplied in the language of Calamy, I have not been able to obtain the\r\nslightest information.\r\n\r\nThe troubles that covered the whole period, since the beginning of Mr.\r\nBayley's ministry, had led to the neglect and derangement of the entire\r\norganization of the Village, and resulted in the loss of what little\r\nopportunities for education might otherwise have been provided. So\r\ngreat was this evil regarded, that the old town felt it necessary to\r\ninterpose; and we find it voted Jan. 24, 1682, that \"Lieutenant John\r\nPutnam is desired, and is hereby empowered, to take care that the law\r\nrelating to the catechising of children and youth be duly attended at\r\nthe Village.\" He is also \"desired to have a diligent care that all the\r\nfamilies do carefully and constantly attend the due education of their\r\nchildren and youth according to law.\" We cannot but feel that the man\r\nwho was ready to fight the \"Topsfield men\" in the woods—who, when they\r\nasked him, \"What, by violence?\" answered, with axe in hand, \"Ay, by\r\nviolence,\" and who figured in the manner described in the scene with\r\nMr. Burroughs—was a singular person to intrust with the charge of\r\n\"catechising the children and youth.\" But those were queer times, and\r\nhe was a queer character. He[i.285] had always been a church-member;\r\nand, to the day of his death, church and prayer meetings were more\r\nfrequently held at his house than in any other. He was a rough man, but\r\nhe was no hypocrite. He was in the front of every encounter; but he was\r\ntolerant, too, of difference of opinion. When, at one time, the\r\ncontests of the Village were at their height, and two committees were\r\nraised representing the two conflicting parties, he was at the head of\r\none, and his eldest son (Jonathan) of the other. Their opposition does\r\nnot seem to have alienated them. While I have found it necessary to\r\nhold him up, in some of his actions, for condemnation, there were many\r\ngood points about him; although he was not the sort of man that would\r\nbe likely, in our times, to be selected to execute the functions of a\r\nSunday-school teacher.\r\n\r\nDuring all this period, there was a variety of minor controversies\r\namong themselves, causing greater or less disturbance. Joseph\r\nHutchinson, who had given a site out of his homestead-grounds for the\r\nmeeting-house, had no patience with their perpetual wranglings. He\r\nfenced up his lands around the meeting-house lot, leaving them an\r\nentrance on the end towards the road. They went to court about it, and\r\nhe was called to account by the usual process of law. The plain, gruff\r\nold farmer, who seems all along to have been a man of strong sense and\r\ndecided character, filed an answer, which is unsurpassed for bluntness\r\nof expression. It has no language of ceremony, but goes to the point at\r\nonce. It has a general inter[i.286]est as showing, to how late a period\r\nthe inhabitants of this neighborhood were exposed to Indian attacks,\r\nand what means of defence were resorted to by the Village worshippers.\r\nThe document manifests the contempt in which he held the complainants,\r\nand it was all the satisfaction they got.\r\n\r\n\"Joseph Hutchinson his answer is as followeth:—\r\n\r\n\"First, as to the covenant they spoke of, I conceive it is neither\r\nknown of by me nor them, as will appear by records from the farmer's\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n\"Second, I conceive they have no cause to complain of me for fencing in\r\nmy own land; for I am sure I fenced in none of theirs. I wish they\r\nwould not pull down my fences. I am loath to complain, though I have\r\njust cause.\r\n\r\n\"Third, for blocking up the meeting-house, it was they did it, and not\r\nI, in the time of the Indian wars; and they made Salem pay for it. I\r\nwish they would bring me my rocks they took to do it with; for I want\r\nthem to make fence with.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, hoping this honored Court will see that there was no just cause\r\nto complain against me, and their cause will appear unjust in that they\r\nwould in an unjust way take away my land, I trust I shall have relief;\r\nso I rest, your Honor's servant,\r\n\r\nJoseph Hutchinson.\"\r\n\r\n[Nov. 27, 1686.]\r\n\r\nThe next minister of Salem Village brought matters to a crisis. Samuel\r\nParris is stated to have been a son of Thomas Parris, of London, and\r\nwas born in 1653. He was, for a time, a member of Harvard College, but\r\ndid not finish the academic course, being[i.287] drawn to a commercial\r\nlife. He was engaged in the West-India business, and probably lived at\r\nBarbadoes. After a while, he abandoned commerce, and prepared himself\r\nfor the ministry. There was at this time, and long subsequently, a very\r\nparticular mercantile connection between Salem and Barbadoes. The\r\nformer husband of the wife of Thomas Putnam, Sr.,—Nathaniel Veren,—as\r\nhas been stated, had property in that island, and was more or less\r\nacquainted with its people. Perhaps it was through this channel that\r\nthe thoughts of the people of the Village were turned towards Mr.\r\nParris. From a deposition made by him a few years afterwards in a suit\r\nat law between him and his parishioners, we learn some interesting\r\nfacts relating to the negotiations that led to his settlement.\r\n\r\nIt appears from his statement that a committee, consisting of \"Captain\r\nJohn Putnam, Mr. Joshua Rea, Sr., and Francis Nurse,\" was appointed, on\r\nthe 15th of November, 1688, to treat with him \"about taking ministerial\r\noffice.\" On the 25th of November, \"after the services in the afternoon,\r\nthe audience was stayed, and, by a general vote, requested Mr. Parris\r\nto take office.\" He hung back for a while, and exercised the skill and\r\nadroitness acquired in his mercantile life in making as sharp a bargain\r\nas he could.\r\n\r\nAt that time, there appeared to be a degree of harmony among the\r\npeople, such as they had never known before. There was a disposition on\r\nall sides to come together, and avail themselves of the occasion\r\nof[i.288] settling a new minister, to bury their past animosities, and\r\nforget their grievances; and there is every reason to believe, if Mr.\r\nParris had promptly closed with their terms, he might have enjoyed a\r\npeaceful ministry, and a happy oblivion have covered for ever his name\r\nand the history of the village. But he withheld response to the call.\r\nThe people were impatient, and felt that the golden opportunity might\r\nbe lost, and the old feuds revive. On the 10th of December, another\r\ncommittee was raised, consisting of Lieutenant Nathaniel Putnam,\r\nSergeant Fuller, Mr. Joshua Rea, Sr., and Sergeant Ingersoll, as\r\n\"messengers, to know whether Mr. Parris would accept of office.\" His\r\nanswer was, \"the work was weighty; they should know in due time.\" They\r\nwere thus kept in suspense during the whole winter, getting no reply\r\nfrom him. On the 29th of April, 1689, \"Deacons Nathaniel Ingersoll and\r\nEdward Putnam, Daniel Rea, Thomas Fuller, Jr., and John Tarbell, came\r\nto Mr. Parris from the meeting-house,\" where there had been a general\r\nmeeting of the inhabitants, and said, \"Being the aged men had had the\r\nmatter of Mr. Parris's settlement so long in hand, and effected\r\nnothing, they were desirous to try what the younger could do.\" Deacon\r\nIngersoll was about fifty-five years of age; but his spirit and\r\ncharacter kept him in sympathy with the progressive impulses of younger\r\nmen. Deacon Putnam was thirty-four years of age. Daniel Rea was the son\r\nof Joshua; Thomas Fuller, Jr., the son of Sergeant Fuller; and John\r\nTarbell, the son-in-law of Francis Nurse.[i.289]\r\n\r\nThis is the first appearance, I believe, in our history, of that\r\nnotorious and most pretentious personage who has figured so largely in\r\nall our affairs ever since, \"Young America.\" The sequel shows, that, in\r\nthis instance at least, no benefit arose from discarding the caution\r\nand experience of years. The \"younger men\" were determined to \"go\r\nahead.\" They said they were desirous of a speedy answer. Finding them\r\nin a temper to \"finish the thing up,\" at any rate, and seeing that they\r\nwere ambitious to get the credit of \"effecting something,\" and, for\r\nthat end, predisposed to come to his terms, he disclosed them. They had\r\noffered him a salary of sixty pounds per annum,—one third in money, the\r\nrest in provisions, at certain specified rates. He agreed to accept the\r\ncall on the foregoing terms, with certain additional conditions thus\r\ndescribed by himself: \"First, when money shall be more plenteous, the\r\nmoney part to be paid me shall accordingly be increased. Second, though\r\ncorn or like provisions should arise to a higher price than you have\r\nset, yet, for my own family use, I shall have what is needful at the\r\nprice now stated, and so if it fall lower. Third, the whole sixty\r\npounds to be only from our inhabitants that are dwelling in our bounds,\r\nproportionable to what lands they have within the same. Fourth, no\r\nprovision to be brought in without first asking whether needed, and\r\nmyself to make choice of what, unless the person is unable to pay in\r\nany sort but one. Fifth, firewood to be given in yearly, freely. Sixth,\r\ntwo men to be chosen yearly to see that due payments be made.[i.290]\r\nSeventh, contributions each sabbath in papers; and only such as are in\r\npapers, and dwelling within our bounds, to be accounted a part of the\r\nsixty pounds. Eighth, as God shall please to bless the place so as to\r\nbe able to rise higher than the sixty pounds, that then a\r\nproportionable increase be made. If God shall please, for our sins, to\r\ndiminish the substance of said place, I will endeavor accordingly to\r\nbear such losses, by proportionable abatements of such as shall\r\nreasonably desire it.\"\r\n\r\nA contribution-box was either handed around by the deacons, before the\r\ncongregation was dismissed, or attached permanently near the porch or\r\ndoor. Rate-payers would inclose their money in papers, with their\r\nnames, and drop them in. When the box was opened, the sums inclosed\r\nwould be entered to their credit on the rate-schedule. There was always\r\na considerable number of stated worshippers in the congregation who\r\nlived without the bounds of the village, and often transient visitors\r\nor strangers happened to be at meeting. It was a point that had not\r\nbeen determined, whether moneys collected from the above descriptions\r\nof persons should go into the general treasury of the parish, to be\r\nused in meeting their contract to pay the minister's salary, or be kept\r\nas a separate surplus.\r\n\r\nThe terms, as thus described by Mr. Parris, show that he had profited\r\nby his experience in trade, and knew how to make a shrewd bargain. It\r\nwas quite certain that a farming community in a new country, with\r\nfields continually reclaimed from the wilderness and[i.291] added to\r\nculture, would increase in substance: if so, his annual stipend would\r\nincrease. If the place should decline, he was to abate the tax of\r\nindividuals, if desired by them personally, so far as he should judge\r\ntheir petition to that effect reasonable. If \"strangers' money,\" or\r\ncontributions from \"outsiders,\" were not to go to make up his sixty\r\npounds, it was quite probable that it would come into his pocket as an\r\nextra allowance, or perquisite.\r\n\r\nHe says that the committee accepted these terms, and agreed to them,\r\nexpressing their belief that the people also would. No record appears\r\non the parish-books of the appointment of this committee of the\r\n\"younger men,\" or of the action of the society on their report, or of\r\nany report having been made at that time. In the mean while, Mr. Parris\r\ncontinued to preach and act as the minister of the society until his\r\nordination, near the close of the year. There was a meeting on the 21st\r\nof May; but the record consists of but a single entry,—the appointment\r\nof a committee \"as overseers for the year ensuing, to take care of our\r\nmeeting-house and other public charges, and to make return according to\r\nlaw.\" The next entry is of a general meeting of the inhabitants, on the\r\n18th of June, 1689. The choice of the regular standing committee for\r\nthe year is recorded. Immediately following this entry, are these\r\nwords:—\r\n\r\n\"At the same meeting,—the 18th of June, 1689,—it was agreed and voted\r\nby general concurrence, that, for Mr. Parris, his encouragement and\r\nsettlement in the work of the[i.292] ministry amongst us, we will give\r\nhim sixty six pounds for his yearly salary,—one-third paid in money,\r\nthe other two-third parts for provisions, &c.; and Mr. Parris to find\r\nhimself firewood, and Mr. Parris to keep the ministry-house in good\r\nrepair; and that Mr. Parris shall also have the use of the\r\nministry-pasture, and the inhabitants to keep the fence in repair; and\r\nthat we will keep up our contributions, and our inhabitants to put\r\ntheir money in papers, and this to continue so long as Mr. Parris\r\ncontinues in the work of the ministry amongst us, and all productions\r\nto be good and merchantable. And, if it please God to bless the\r\ninhabitants, we shall be willing to give more; and to expect, that if\r\nGod shall diminish the estates of the people, that then Mr. Parris do\r\nabate of his salary according to proportion.\"\r\n\r\nComparing this record with the account given by Mr. Parris of the eight\r\nconditions upon which he agreed, in conference with the committee of\r\nthe \"younger\" sort, on the 29th of April, to accept the call of the\r\nparish, the difference is not very essential. The matter of firewood\r\nwas arranged, according to his account, by mutual agreement, they to\r\nadd six pounds to his salary, and he to find his own wood. The rates of\r\n\"the inhabitants\" were to be paid \"in papers.\" The only point of\r\ndifference, touching this matter, is that the record is silent about\r\ncontributions by outsiders and strangers; whereas he says it was\r\nagreed, on the 29th of April, that they should not go towards making up\r\nhis salary. The idea of his salary rising with the growth and sinking\r\nwith the decline of the society is expressed in the record[i.293]\r\nsubstantially as it is by him, only it is made exact; and, in case of a\r\ndecline in the means of the people, a corresponding decline is to be in\r\nthe aggregate of his salary, and not by abatements made by him in\r\nindividual cases. The variations are nearly, if not quite, all\r\nunimportant in their nature, and such as a regard to mutual convenience\r\nwould suggest. Yet there was something in the above record which highly\r\nexasperated Mr. Parris.\r\n\r\nIn his deposition he states, that, at a meeting held on the 17th of\r\nMay, of which there is no record in the parish book, he was sent for\r\nand was present. He says that there was \"much agitation\" at the\r\nmeeting. He says that objection was made by the people to two of his\r\n\"eight\" conditions, the fifth and seventh. But there is nothing in the\r\nrecord of the 18th of June in conflict with what he says was finally\r\nagreed upon, except the disposition that should be made of \"strangers'\r\nmoney.\" The question then recurs, What was the cause of the \"much\r\nagitation\" at that meeting? What was it in the language of that record\r\nwhich always so excited Mr. Parris's wrath?\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that the offensive words were those which\r\nrequire \"Mr. Parris to keep the ministry house in good repair,\" and\r\nthat he \"shall also have the use of the ministry pasture;\" and this was\r\nnot objectionable as involving any expense upon him, but solely because\r\nthe language employed precluded the supposition that the parish had\r\ncountenanced the idea of ever conveying the parsonage and parsonage\r\nlands[i.294] to him in his own right and absolutely. This was an object\r\nwhich he evidently had in view from the first, and to which he clung to\r\nthe last. It is to be feared, that some of the members of the\r\n\"Young-America\" committee, in their heedless and inconsiderate\r\neagerness to \"effect\" something, to settle Mr. Parris forthwith, and\r\nthereby prove how much more competent they were than \"the aged men\" to\r\ntransact a weighty business, had encouraged Mr. Parris to think that\r\nhis favorite object could be accomplished. Upon a little inquiry,\r\nhowever, they discovered that it could not be done; but that the house\r\nand land were secured by the original deeds of conveyance, and by\r\nirreversible agreements and conditions, to the use of the ministry, for\r\nthe time being and for ever. So far as the committee or any of its\r\nmembers had favored this idea in their conference with Mr. Parris, they\r\nhad taken a position from which they had to retreat. They had\r\ncompromised themselves and the parish. For this reason, perhaps, they\r\nmade no report; and no mention of their agency appears on the records.\r\nHow far Deacon Ingersoll was misled by his younger associates on this\r\noccasion, I know not; but he was not a man to break a promise if he\r\ncould keep it, no matter how much to his own loss. He recognized his\r\nresponsibility as chairman of the unfortunate committee, and retrieved\r\nthe mistake they had made, by giving to Mr. Parris, by deed, a lot of\r\nland adjoining the parsonage property, and in value equal to the whole\r\nof it. The date of that conveyance, immediately after Mr. Parris's\r\nordination, corroborates[i.295] the conjecture that it was made to\r\ncompensate Mr. Parris for the failure of his expectation to get\r\npossession of the ministry property. It ought to have been received by\r\nhim as an equivalent, and have soothed his angry disappointment; but it\r\ndid not. He had indulged the belief, that he had effected a bargain\r\nwith the parish, at his settlement, which had made him the owner, in\r\nfee simple, of the parish property; and when he found that the record\r\nof the terms of his settlement, in the parish-book, absolutely\r\nprecluded that idea, his exasperation was great, and no reparation\r\nDeacon Ingersoll or any one else could make was suffered to appease it.\r\nThe following deposition, made in court some years afterwards, gives an\r\naccount of a scene in the meeting-house after Parris's ordination:—\r\n\r\n\"Ipswich Court, 1697.—Parris _versus_ Inhabitants of Salem Village.\r\n\r\n\"We the undersigned testify and say, that, a considerable time after\r\nMr. Parris his ordination, there was a meeting of the inhabitants of\r\nSalem Village at the usual place of meeting; and the occasion of the\r\nmeeting was concerning Mr. Parris, and several persons were at that\r\nmeeting, that had not, before this meeting, joined with the people in\r\ncalling or agreeing with Mr. Parris; and the said persons desired that\r\nthose things that concerned Mr. Parris and the people might be read,\r\nand accordingly it was. And the entry, that some call a salary, being\r\nread, there arose a difference among the people, the occasion of which\r\nwas finding an entry in the book of the Village records, relating to\r\nMr. Parris his maintenance, which was dated the 18th of June,[i.296]\r\n1689; and, the entry being read to the people, some replied that they\r\nbelieved that Mr. Parris would not comply with that entry; whereupon\r\none said it was best to send for Mr. Parris to resolve the question.\r\nAccordingly, he was sent for. He coming to the people, this entry of\r\nthe 18th of June, 1689, was read to Mr. Parris. His answer was as\r\nfollows: 'He never heard or knew any thing of it, neither could or\r\nwould he take up with it, or any part of it;' and further he said,\r\n'They were knaves and cheaters that entered it.' And Lieutenant\r\nNathaniel Putnam, being moderator of that meeting, replied to Mr.\r\nParris, and said, 'Sir, then there is only proposals on both sides, and\r\nno agreement between you and the people.' And Mr. Parris answered and\r\nsaid, 'No more, there is not; for I am free from the people, and the\r\npeople free from me:' and so the meeting broke up. And we further\r\ntestify, that there hath not been any agreement made with Mr. Parris,\r\nthat we knew of or ever heard of,—never since.\r\n\r\n\"Joseph Porter.\r\nDaniel Andrew.\r\nJoseph Putnam.\r\n\r\n\"Sworn in Court, at Ipswich, April 13, 1697, by all three.\r\n\r\nAttest, Stephen Sewall, _Clerk_.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer which Mr. Parris made to Nathaniel Putnam's inquiry probably\r\nsettled the question in the suit then pending, and led to the final\r\nrelease of the parish from him. It is hard to find any point of\r\ndifference between his own account of the conditions he himself made,\r\nand the record of the parish-book, of sufficient importance to account\r\nfor the storm of passion[i.297] into which the reading of the latter\r\ndrove him, except in the language which I have suggested as the\r\nprobable occasion of his wrath. Unfortunately for him, there is\r\nevidence quite corroborative of this suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe parish-book has the following record:—\r\n\r\n\"At a general meeting of the inhabitants of Salem Village, Oct. 10,\r\n1689, it was agreed and voted, that the vote, in our book of record of\r\n1681, that lays, as some say, an entailment upon our ministry house and\r\nland, is hereby made void and of no effect; one man only dissenting.\r\n\r\n\"It was voted and agreed by a general concurrence, that we will give to\r\nMr. Parris our ministry house and barn, and two acres of land next\r\nadjoining to the house; and that Mr. Parris take office amongst us, and\r\nlive and die in the work of the ministry among us; and, if Mr. Parris\r\nor his heirs do sell the house and land, that the people may have the\r\nfirst refusal of it, by giving as much as other men will. A committee\r\nwas chosen to lay out the land, and make a conveyance of the house and\r\nland, and to make the conveyance in the name and in the behalf of the\r\ninhabitants unto Mr. Parris and his heirs.\"\r\n\r\nThe record of these votes is not signed by the clerk, and there is no\r\nevidence that the meeting was legally warned. It does not appear in\r\nwhose custody the book then was. But, however the entry got in, it\r\nproves that Parris's friends were determined to gratify his all but\r\ninsane purpose to get possession of what he ought to have known it was\r\nimpossible for the parish to give, or for him or his heirs to hold. It\r\nwas indeed a miserable commencement of his ministry, to introduce\r\nsuch[i.298] a strife with a people who really seem to have had an\r\nearnest desire to receive him with united hearts, and make his\r\nsettlement and ministry the harbinger of a better day. But he alienated\r\nmany of them, at the very start, by his sharp practice in negotiating\r\nabout the pecuniary details of his agreement with the parish. When,\r\nafter all their care to prevent it, it became known that somehow or\r\nother a vote had got upon the records, conveying to him outright their\r\nministerial property, there was great indignation; and a determined\r\neffort was made to recover what they declared to be \"a fraudulent\r\nconveying-away\" of the property of the society.\r\n\r\nA more violent conflict than any before was let loose upon that devoted\r\npeople. The old passions were rekindled. Men ranged themselves as the\r\nfriends and opponents of Mr. Parris in bitter antagonism. Rates were\r\nnot collected; the meeting-house went into dilapidation; complaints\r\nwere made to the County Court; orders were issued to collect rates, but\r\nthey were disregarded; and all was confusion, disorder, and contention.\r\n\r\nA church was organized in connection with the village parish, and Mr.\r\nParris ordained on Monday, Nov. 19, 1689. The covenant adopted was the\r\n\"confession of faith owned and consented unto by the elders and\r\nmessengers of the churches assembled at Boston, New England, May 12,\r\n1680.\" In the library of the Connecticut Historical Society, there is a\r\nmanuscript volume of sermons and abstracts of sermons preached[i.299]\r\nby Mr. Parris between November, 1689, and May, 1694. It begins with his\r\nordination sermon, which has this prefix: \"My poor and weak ordination\r\nsermon, at the embodying of a church at Salem Village on the 19th of\r\nthe ninth month, 1689, the Rev. Mr. Nicholas Noyes embodying of us; who\r\nalso ordained my most unworthy self pastor, and, together with the Rev.\r\nMr. Samuel Phillips and the Rev. Mr. John Hale, imposed hands,—the same\r\nMr. Phillips giving me the right hand of fellowship with beautiful\r\nloveliness and humility.\" The text is from Josh. v. 9: \"And the Lord\r\nsaid unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt\r\nfrom off you.\"\r\n\r\nThe first entry in the church-records, after the covenant and the names\r\nof the members, is the following: \"Nov. 24, 1689.—Sab: day. Brother\r\nNathaniel Ingersoll chosen, by a general vote of the brethren, to\r\nofficiate in the place of a deacon for a time.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Parris commenced his administration by showing that he meant to\r\nexercise the disciplinary powers intrusted to him, as pastor of a\r\nchurch, with a high hand, and without much regard to persons or\r\ncircumstances. Ezekiel Cheever had been a member of the mother-church\r\nin Salem twenty years before, was one of the founders of the parish\r\nchurch, and appears to have been a worthy and amiable person, occupying\r\nand owning the farm of his uncle, Captain Lothrop. On the sudden\r\nillness of a member of his family, being \"in distress for a horse,\"\r\nnone of his own being[i.300] available at the time, he rushed, in his\r\nhurry and alarm, to the stable of a neighbor, took one of his horses,\r\n\"without leave or asking of it,\" and rode, post haste, for a doctor.\r\nOne would have thought that an affair of this sort, in such an\r\nexigency, might have been left to neighborly explanation or adjustment.\r\nBut Mr. Parris regarded it as giving a good opportunity for an exercise\r\nof power that would strike the terrors of discipline home upon the\r\nwhole community. About five or six weeks after the occurrence, Cheever\r\nwas dealt with in the manner thus described by Mr. Parris, in his\r\nchurch-record, dated \"Sab: 30 March, 1690.\" He was \"called forth to\r\ngive satisfaction to the offended church, as also the last sabbath he\r\nwas called forth for the same purpose; but then he failed in giving\r\nsatisfaction, by reason of somewhat mincing in the latter part of his\r\nconfession, which, in the former, he had more ingenuously acknowledged:\r\nbut this day, the church received satisfaction, as was testified by\r\ntheir holding-up of their hands; and, after the whole, a word of\r\ncaution by the pastor was dropped upon the offender in particular, and\r\nupon us all in general.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Parris was evidently inclined to magnify the importance of the\r\nchurch, and to get it into such a state of subserviency to his\r\nauthority, that he could wield it effectually as a weapon in his fight\r\nwith the congregation. With this view, he endeavored to render the\r\naction of the church as dignified and imposing as possible; to enlarge\r\nand expand its ceremonial proceedings, and make it the theatre for the\r\nexercise of[i.301] his authority as its head and ruler. This feature of\r\nhis policy was so strikingly illustrated in the course he took in\r\nreference to the deacons, that I must present it as recorded by him in\r\nthe church-book. It is worth preserving as a curiosity in\r\necclesiastical administration.\r\n\r\nNathaniel Ingersoll had been a professor of religion almost as long as\r\nMr. Parris had lived. He was eminently a Christian man, of acknowledged\r\npiety, and beloved and revered by all. He had been the patron,\r\nbenefactor, and guardian of the parish and all its interests from its\r\nformation. He had long held the title of deacon, and exercised the\r\nfunctions of that office so far as they could be exercised previous to\r\nthe organization of a church. He had been the almoner of the charities\r\nof the people, and their adviser and religious friend in all things. He\r\nwas approaching the boundaries of advanced years, and already\r\nrecognized among the fathers of the community. It would have seemed no\r\nmore than what all might have expected, to have had him recognized as a\r\ndeacon of the church, in full standing, at the first. It was, no doubt,\r\nwhat all did expect. But no: he must be put upon probation. He was\r\nchosen deacon \"for the present\" in November, 1689. Mr. Parris kept the\r\nmatter of confirmation hanging in his own hands for a year and a half.\r\nThe appointment of the other deacon was kept suspended for a full year.\r\nOn the 30th of November, 1690, there is the following entry:[i.302]—\r\n\r\n\"This evening, after the public service was over, the church was, by\r\nthe pastor, desired to stay, and then by him Brother Edward Putnam was\r\npropounded as a meet person for to be chosen as another deacon. The\r\nissue whereof was, that, it being now an excessive cold day, some did\r\npropose that another season might be pitched upon for discourse\r\nthereof. Whereupon the pastor mentioned the next fourth day, at two of\r\nthe clock, at the pastor's house, for further discourse thereof; to\r\nwhich the church agreed by not dissenting.\"\r\n\r\nThe record of the proceedings on the \"next fourth day\" is as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"3 December, 1690.—This afternoon, at a church meeting appointed the\r\nlast sabbath, Brother Edward Putnam was again propounded to the church\r\nfor choice to office in the place of a deacon to join with, and be\r\nassistant to, Brother Ingersoll in the service, and in order to said\r\nPutnam's ordination in the office, upon his well approving himself\r\ntherein. Some proposed that two might be nominated to the church, out\r\nof which the church to choose one. But arguments satisfactory were\r\nproduced against that way. Some also moved for a choice by papers; but\r\nthat way also was disapproved by the arguments of the pastor and some\r\nothers. In fine, the pastor put it to vote (there appearing not the\r\nleast exception from any, unless a modest and humble exception of the\r\nperson himself, once and again), and it was carried in the affirmative\r\nby a universal vote, _nemine non suffragante_.\r\n\r\n\"Afterwards, the pastor addressed himself to the elected brother, and,\r\nin the name of the church, desired his answer, who replied to this\r\npurpose:[i.303]—\r\n\r\n'Seeing, sir, you say the voice of God's people is the voice of God,\r\ndesiring your prayers and the prayers of the church for divine\r\nassistance therein, I do accept of the call.'\"\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that Edward Putnam was, at Mr. Parris's ordination\r\nmore than a year before, and had been for some time previous to that\r\nevent, Ingersoll's associate deacon, and that there probably never was\r\nany other person spoken or thought of than these two for deacons, it is\r\nevident that it was Mr. Parris's policy to make a great matter of the\r\naffair, and produce a general feeling of the weighty importance of\r\nchurch action in the premises. But this was only the beginning of the\r\nlong-drawn ceremonial solemnities by which the occasion was magnified.\r\n\r\n\"Sab: day, 7 December, 1690.—After the evening public service was over,\r\nseveral things needful were transacted; viz.:—\r\n\r\n\"1. The pastor acquainted those of the church that were ignorant of it,\r\nthat Brother Edward Putnam was chosen deacon the last church meeting.\r\n\r\n\"2. He also generally admonished those of the brethren that were absent\r\nat that time, of their disorderliness therein, telling them that such,\r\nthe apostle bids, should be noted or marked (2 Thess. iii. 6-16); that\r\nis, with a church mark,—a mark in a disciplinary way; and therefore\r\nbegged amendment for the future in that point and to that purpose.\r\n\r\n\"3. He propounded whether they so far were satisfied in Brother\r\nIngersoll's service as to call him to settlement in[i.304] the\r\ndeaconship by ordination, or had aught against it. But no brother made\r\npersonal exception. Therefore, it being put to vote, it was carried in\r\nthe affirmative by a plurality, if not universality.\r\n\r\n\"4. The Lord's Table, not being provided for with aught else but two\r\npewter tankards, the pastor propounded and desired that the next\r\nsacrament-day, which is to be the 21st instant, there be a more open\r\nand liberal contribution by the communicants, that so the deacons may\r\nhave wherewith to furnish the said table decently; which was consented\r\nto.\"\r\n\r\nThe last clause, \"which was consented to,\" is in a smaller hand than\r\nthe rest of the record. It was written by Mr. Parris, but apparently\r\nsome time afterwards, and with fainter ink. There is reason to suppose\r\nthat nothing was accomplished at that time in the way of getting rid of\r\nthe \"pewter tankards.\" The farmers were too hard pressed by taxes\r\nimposed by the province, and by the weight of local assessments, to\r\nlisten to fanciful appeals. They probably continued for some time, and\r\nperhaps until after receiving Deacon Ingersoll's legacy, in 1720, to\r\nget along as they were. They did not believe, that, in order to\r\napproach the presence, and partake of the memorials, of the Saviour, it\r\nwas necessary to bring vessels of silver or gold. In their\r\ncircumstances, gathered in their humble rustic edifice for worship,\r\nthey did not feel that, in the sight of the Lord, costly furniture\r\nwould add to the adornment of his table.\r\n\r\nNearly six months after Putnam's election, Mr.[i.305] Parris brought up\r\nthe matter again at a meeting of the church, on the 31st of May, 1691,\r\nand made a speech relating to it, which he entered on the records\r\nthus:—\r\n\r\n\"The pastor spoke to the brethren to this purpose, viz.:—\r\n\r\n\"Brethren,—The ordination of Brother Ingersoll has already been voted a\r\ngood while since, and I thought to have consummated the affair a good\r\ntime since, but have been put by, by diversity of occurrents; and,\r\nseeing it is so long since, I think it needless to make two works of\r\none, and therefore intend the ordination of Brother Putnam together\r\nwith Brother Ingersoll in the deaconship, if you continue in the same\r\nmind as when you elected him: therefore, if you are so, let a vote\r\nmanifest it. Voted by all, or at least the most. I observed none that\r\nvoted not.\"\r\n\r\nAt last the mighty work was accomplished. Deacon Ingersoll had been on\r\nprobation for eighteen months from the date of his election, which took\r\nplace five days after Mr. Parris's ordination. His final induction to\r\noffice was observed with great formality, and in the presence of the\r\nwhole congregation. Mr. Parris enters the order of performances in the\r\nchurch records as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"Sab: 28 June, 1691.—After the afternoon sermon upon 1 Tim. iii. 8, 9,\r\n10, 11, 12, 13, as the brethren had renewed their call of Brother\r\nIngersoll to the office of a deacon, and he himself had declared his\r\nacceptance, the pastor proceeded to ordain him, using the form\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\"Beloved Brother, God having called you to the office[i.306] of a\r\ndeacon by the choice of the brethren and your own acceptance, and that\r\ncall being now to be consummated according to the primitive pattern, 6\r\nActs 6, by prayer and imposition of hands,—\r\n\r\n\"We do, therefore, by this solemnity, declare your investiture into\r\nthat office, solemnly charging you in the name of our Lord Jesus\r\nChrist, the King of his Church, who walks in the midst of his golden\r\ncandlesticks, with eyes as of a flame of fire, exactly observing the\r\ndemeanor of all in his house, both officers and members, that you labor\r\nso to carry it, as to evidence you are sanctified by grace, qualified\r\nfor this work, and to grow in those qualifications; behaving of\r\nyourself gravely, sincerely, temperately, with due care for the\r\ngovernment of your own house, holding the mystery of the faith in a\r\npure conscience; that as they in this office are called 'helps,' so you\r\nbe helpful in your place and capacity, doing what is your part for the\r\npromoting of the work of Christ here. We do charge you, that, whatever\r\nyou do in this office, you do it faithfully, giving with simplicity,\r\nshowing mercy with cheerfulness. Look on it, brother, as matter of\r\ncare, and likewise of encouragement, that both the office itself and\r\nalso your being set up in it is of God, who, being waited upon, will be\r\nwith you, and accept you therein, assisting you to use the office of a\r\ndeacon well, so as that you may be blameless, purchasing to yourself a\r\ngood degree and great boldness in the faith.\r\n\r\n\"Note.—That Brother Putnam was not yet willing to be ordained, but\r\ndesired further considering time, between him and I and Brother\r\nIngersoll, in private discourse the week before the ordination above\r\nsaid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brother Putnam\" probably partook of the general[i.307] wonder what all\r\nthis appearance of difficulty and delay, under the peculiar\r\ncircumstances of the case, meant; and being, as the record truly says,\r\na modest and humble man, he naturally shrank from the formidable\r\nceremoniousness and pretentious parade with which Mr. Parris surrounded\r\nthe transaction. At any rate, he hesitated long before he was willing\r\nto encounter it. It is probable that he positively refused to have his\r\ninduction to the office heralded with such solemn pomp. There is no\r\nmention of his public ordination, which Mr. Parris would not have\r\nomitted to record, had any such scene occurred. All we know is that he\r\nwas recognized as deacon forthwith, and held the office for forty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe disposition of Mr. Parris to make use of his office, as the head of\r\nthe church, to multiply occasions for the exercise of his influence,\r\nand to gain control over the minds of the brethren, is apparent\r\nthroughout his records. He raised objections in order to show how he\r\ncould remove them, and started difficulties about matters which had not\r\nbefore been brought into question. In the beginning of his ministry, he\r\nmanifested this propensity. At a church meeting at John Putnam's house,\r\nFeb. 20, 1690, less than three months after his ordination, he threw\r\nopen the whole question of baptism for discussion among the brethren.\r\nThere is no reason to suppose that their attention had been drawn to it\r\nbefore. He propounded the question to the plain, practical husbandmen,\r\n\"Who are the proper subjects of baptism?\" He laid down the true[i.308]\r\ndoctrine, as he regarded it, in this answer, \"Covenant-professing\r\nbelievers and their infant seed.\" He put the answer to vote, and none\r\nvoted against it. He then proceeded with another question, \"How far may\r\nwe account such seed infant seed, and so to be baptized?\" Here he had\r\ngot beyond their depth, and, as some of them thought, his own too; for\r\nthere was only a \"major vote\" in favor of his answer: \"two or three, I\r\nthink not four, dissented.\" There was some danger of getting into\r\ndivisions by introducing such questions; but he managed to avoid it, so\r\nfar as his church was concerned. He worked them up to the highest\r\nconfidence in his learning and wisdom, and gained complete ascendency\r\nover them. He aggrandized their sense of importance, and accomplished\r\nhis object in securing their support in his controversies with his\r\ncongregation. The brethren, after a while, became his devoted\r\nbody-guard, and the church a fortress of defence and assault. There is\r\nreason, however, to believe, that the points he raised on the subject\r\nof baptism led to perplexities, in some minds, which long continued to\r\ndisturb them. While showing off his learning, and displaying his\r\ncapacity to dispose of the deep questions of theology, he let fall\r\nseeds of division and doubt that ripened into contention in subsequent\r\ngenerations. The only ripple on the surface of the Village Church\r\nduring its long record of peace, since the close of his disastrous\r\nministry, was occasioned by differing opinions on this subject. It\r\nrequired all the wisdom of his successors to quiet them. From time to\r\ntime, formulas had[i.309] to be constructed, half-way covenants of\r\nvarying expressions to be framed, to meet and dispose of the\r\ndifficulties thus gratuitously raised by him.\r\n\r\nThe following passages from his record-book show how he made much of a\r\nmatter which any other pastor would have quietly arranged without\r\ncalling for the intervention of church or congregation: they are also\r\ninteresting as a picture of the times:—\r\n\r\n\"Sab: 9 Aug. 1691.—After all public worship was over, and the church\r\nstayed on purpose, I proposed to the church whether they were free to\r\nadmit to baptism, upon occasion, such as were not at present free to\r\ncome up to full communion. I told them there was a young woman, by name\r\nHan: Wilkins, the daughter of our Brother Thomas Wilkins, who much\r\ndesired to be baptized, but yet did not dare to come to the Lord's\r\nSupper. If they had nothing against it, I should take their silence for\r\nconsent, and in due time acquaint them with what she had offered me to\r\nmy satisfaction, and proceed accordingly.\"\r\n\r\nNo answer was made _pro_ or _con_, and so the church was dismissed.\r\n\r\n\"Sab: 23 Aug. 1691.—Hannah Wilkins, aged about twenty-one years, was\r\ncalled forth, and her relation read in the full assembly, and then it\r\nwas propounded to the church, that, if they had just exceptions, or, on\r\nthe other hand, had any thing farther to encourage, they had\r\nopportunity and liberty to speak. None said any thing but Brother Bray\r\nWilkins (Han: grandfather), who said, that, for all he knew, such a\r\nrelation as had been given and a conversation suitable[i.310] (as he\r\njudged hers to be) was enough to enjoy full communion. None else saying\r\nany thing, it was put to vote whether they were so well satisfied as to\r\nreceive this young woman into membership, and therefore initiate her\r\ntherein by baptism. It was voted fully. Whereupon the covenant was\r\ngiven to her as if she had entered into full communion. And the pastor\r\ntold her, in the name of the church, that we would expect and wait for\r\nher rising higher, and therefore advised her to attend all means\r\nconscientiously for that end.\r\n\r\n\"After all, I pronounced her a member of this church, and then baptized\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"28 August, 1691.—This day, Sister Hannah Wilkins aforesaid came to me,\r\nand spake to this like effect, following:—\r\n\r\n\"Before I was baptized (you know, sir), I was desirous of communion at\r\nthe Lord's Table, but not yet; I was afraid of going so far: but since\r\nmy baptism I find my desires growing to the Lord's Table, and I am\r\nafraid to turn my back upon that ordinance, or to refuse to partake\r\nthereof. And that which moves me now to desire full communion, which I\r\nwas afraid of before, is that of Thomas, 20 John 26, &c., where he,\r\nbeing absent from the disciples, though but once, lost a sight of\r\nChrist, and got more hardness of heart, or increase of unbelief. And\r\nalso those words of Ananias to Paul after his conversion, 22 Acts 16,\r\n'And now why tarriest thou? Arise,' &c. So I am afraid of tarrying. The\r\npresent time is only mine. And God having, beyond my deserts,\r\ngraciously opened a door, I look upon it my duty to make present\r\nimprovement of it.\r\n\r\n\"Sab: and Sacrament Day, 30 Aug. 1691.—Sister Han: Wilkins's motion\r\n(before the celebration of the[i.311] Lord's Supper was begun) was\r\nmentioned or propounded to the church, and what she said to me (before\r\nhinted) read to them, and then their vote was called for, to answer her\r\ndesire if they saw good; whereupon the church voted in the affirmative\r\nplentifully.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing passages illustrate Mr. Parris's propensity to magnify\r\nthe operations of the church, and to bring its movements as\r\nconspicuously and as often as possible before the eyes of the people.\r\nIt is evident that the humble and timid scruples of this interesting\r\nand intelligent young woman might have been met and removed by personal\r\nconference with her pastor. As her old grandfather seemed to think,\r\nthere was no difficulty in the case whatever. The reflections of a few\r\ndays made the path plain before her. But Mr. Parris paraded the matter\r\non three sabbaths before the church, and on one of them at least before\r\nthe congregation. He called her to come forth, and stand out in the\r\npresence of the \"full assembly.\" As the result of the ordeal, she owned\r\nthe covenant; the church voted her in, as to full communion; and the\r\npastor pronounced her a member of the church, and baptized her as such.\r\nHer sensible conversation with him the next Friday was evidently\r\nintended for the satisfaction of him and others, as explaining her\r\nappearance at the next communion. But another opportunity was offered\r\nto make a display of the case, and he could not resist the temptation.\r\nHe desired to create an impression by reading what she had said to him\r\nin his study, before the church, if not before the whole\r\ncongregation.[i.312] To give a show of propriety in bringing it forward\r\nagain, he felt that some action must be had upon it; hence the vote.\r\nAccordingly, Hannah Wilkins appears by the record to have been twice,\r\non two successive Lord's Days, voted \"plentifully\" into the Salem\r\nVillage Church, when there was no occasion for such an extraordinary\r\nrepetition, as everybody from the first welcomed her into it with the\r\ncordial confidence she merited. I have spread out this proceeding to\r\nyour view, not altogether from its intrinsic interest, but because,\r\nperhaps, it affords the key to interpret the course of this ill-starred\r\nman in his wrangles with his congregation, and his terrible prominency\r\nin the awful scenes of the witchcraft delusion. He seemed to have had a\r\nlove of excitement that was irrepressible, an all but insane passion\r\nfor getting up a scene. When we come to the details of our story, it\r\nwill be for a charitable judgment to determine whether this trait of\r\nhis nature may not be regarded as the cause of all the woes in which he\r\ninvolved others and became involved himself.\r\n\r\nThe church records are, in one respect, in singular contrast with the\r\nparish records. The latter are often silent in reference to matters of\r\ninterest at the time, which might without impropriety have been entered\r\nin them. They are confined strictly to votes and proceedings in legal\r\nmeetings, or what purport to have been meetings legally called; and we\r\nlook in vain for comments or notices relating to outside matters.\r\nExcept when kept by Sergeant Thomas Putnam, they[i.313] are defective\r\nand imperfect. The church records, while made by Mr. Parris, are full\r\nof side remarks, and touches of criticism concerning whatever was going\r\non. This makes them particularly interesting and valuable now. They are\r\ncomposed in their author's clear, natural, and sprightly style; and,\r\nalthough for the most part in an exceedingly small hand, are legible\r\nwith perfect ease, and give us a transcript, not only of the formal\r\ndoings of the church, but of the writer's mind and feelings about\r\nmatters and things in general. We gather from them by far the greater\r\npart of all we know relating to his quarrel with his congregation.\r\n\r\nThis subject constantly engrossed his thoughts. He was continually\r\nintroducing, at church meetings, complaints against the conduct of the\r\nparish committee, and enlarging upon the wrongs he was suffering at\r\ntheir hands. He took occasion on Lecture days, if not in ordinary\r\ndiscourses on the Lord's Day, to give all possible circulation and\r\npublicity to his grievances. The effect of this was, instead of\r\nbringing his people into subjection and carrying his points against\r\nthem, to aggravate their alienation. His manner of dealing with the\r\ndifficulties of the situation into which they had been brought was\r\nharsh and exasperating, and utterly injudicious, imprudent, and\r\nmischievous in all its bearings, producing a condition of things truly\r\nscandalous. His notions and methods, acquired in his mercantile life;\r\nhis haggling with the people about the terms of his salary; and his\r\ngeneral manner and tone, particularly so far as they had been formed by\r\nresidence[i.314] in West-India slave Islands,—were thoroughly\r\ndistasteful, and entirely repugnant, to the feelings, notions, ideas,\r\nand spirit of the farmers of Salem Village. At their meetings, they\r\nshowed a continually increasing strength of opposition to him, and were\r\ncareful to appoint committees who could not be brought under his\r\ninfluence, and would stand firm against all outside pressure.\r\n\r\nIt is quite apparent, that Mr. Parris employed his church, and the\r\nministerial offices generally, as engines to operate against his\r\nopponents; and sometimes rather unscrupulously, as a collocation of\r\ndates and entries shows. A meeting of the parish was warned to be held\r\nOct. 16, 1691. It was important to bring his machinery to bear upon the\r\nfeelings of the people, so as to strengthen the hands of his friends at\r\nthat meeting. The following entry is in the church-book, dated 8th\r\nOctober, 1691: \"Being my Lecture-day, after public service was ended, I\r\nwas so bare of firewood, that I was forced publicly to desire the\r\ninhabitants to take care that I might be provided for; telling them,\r\nthat, had it not been for Mr. Corwin (who had bought wood, being then\r\nat my house), I should hardly have any to burn.\" According to his own\r\naccount, as we have seen, it had been arranged, by mutual agreement,\r\nthat he was to provide his own firewood, six pounds per annum having\r\nbeen added to his salary for that purpose. He selected that item as one\r\nof the necessaries of which he was in want, probably because, as the\r\nwinter was approaching, it would be the best point on[i.315] which to\r\nappeal to the public sympathies, and get up a clamor against his\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\nThe parish meeting was duly held on the 16th of October. Mr. Parris's\r\nspeech, at the preceding Lecture-day, about \"firewood,\" was found not\r\nto have produced the desired effect. The majority against him was as\r\nstrong as ever. A committee made up of his opponents was elected. A\r\nmotion to instruct them to make a rate was rejected, and a warrant\r\nordered to be forthwith issued for a special meeting of the\r\ninhabitants, to examine into all the circumstances connected with the\r\nsettlement of Mr. Parris, and to ascertain whether the meetings which\r\nhad acted therein were legally called, and by what means the right and\r\ntitle of the parish to its ministry house and lands had been brought\r\ninto question. This was pressing matters to an issue. Mr. Parris saw\r\nit, and determined to meet it in advance. He resorted to his church, as\r\nusual, to execute his plan, as the following entries on the record-book\r\nshow:—\r\n\r\n\"1 Nov. 1691.—The pastor desired the brethren to meet at my house, on\r\nto-morrow, an hour and half before sundown.\r\n\r\n\"2 Nov. 1691.—After sunset, about seventeen of the brethren met; to\r\nwhom, after prayer, I spoke to this effect: Brethren, I have not much\r\nto trouble you with now; but you know what committee, the last\r\ntown-meeting here, were chosen; and what they have done, or intend to\r\ndo; it may be better than I. But, you see, I have hardly any\r\nwood[i.316] to burn. I need say no more, but leave the matter to your\r\nserious and godly consideration.\r\n\r\n\"In fine, after some discourse to and fro, the church voted that\r\nCaptain Putnam and the two deacons should go, as messengers from the\r\nchurch, to the committee, to desire them to make a rate for the\r\nminister, and to take care of necessary supplies for him; and that said\r\nmessengers should make their return to the church the next tenth day,\r\nan hour before sunset, at the minister's house, where they would expect\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"10 Nov. 1691.—The messengers abovesaid came with their return, as\r\nappointed; which was, that the committee did not see good to take\r\nnotice of their message, without they had some letter to show under the\r\nchurch's and pastor's hand. But, at this last church meeting, besides\r\nthe three messengers, but three other brethren did appear,—namely,\r\nBrother Thomas Putnam, Thomas Wilkins, and Peter Prescot,—which slight\r\nand neglect of other brethren did not a little trouble me, as I\r\nexpressed myself. But I told these brethren I expected the church\r\nshould be more mindful of me than other people, and their way was plain\r\nbefore them, &c.\r\n\r\n\"Sab: 15 Nov. 1691.—The church were desired to meet at Brother\r\nNathaniel Putnam's, the next 18th instant, at twelve o'clock, to spend\r\nsome time in prayer, and seeking God's presence with us, the next\r\nLord's Day, at his table, as has been usual with us, some time before\r\nthe sacrament.\r\n\r\n\"18 Nov. 1691.—After some time spent, as above said, at this church\r\nmeeting, the pastor desired the brethren to stay, forasmuch as he had\r\nsomewhat to offer to them, which was to this purpose; viz.: Brethren,\r\nseveral church[i.317] meetings have been occasionally warned, and\r\nsometimes the appearance of the brethren is but small to what it might\r\nbe expected, and particularly the case mentioned 10th instant. I told\r\nthem I did not desire to warn meetings unnecessarily, and, therefore,\r\nwhen I did, I prayed them they would regularly attend them.\r\n\r\n\"Furthermore, I told them I had scarce wood enough to burn till the\r\nmorrow, and prayed that some care might be taken. In fine, after\r\ndiscourses passed, these following votes were made unanimously,\r\nnamely:—\r\n\r\n\"1. That it was needful that complaint should be made to the next\r\nhonored County Court, to sit at Salem, the next third day of the week,\r\nagainst the neglects of the present committee.\r\n\r\n\"2. That the said complaint should be drawn up, which was immediately\r\ndone by one of the brethren, and consented to.\r\n\r\n\"3. That our brethren, Nathaniel Putnam, Thomas Putnam, and Thomas\r\nWilkins, should sign said complaint in behalf of the church.\r\n\r\n\"4. Last, That our brethren, Captain John Putnam and the two deacons,\r\nshould be improved to present the said complaint to the said Court.\r\n\r\n\"In the mean time, the pastor desired the brethren that care might be\r\ntaken that he might not be destitute of wood.\"\r\n\r\nThe record proceeds to give several other votes, the object of which\r\nwas to arrange the details of the manner in which the business was to\r\nbe put into court. There we leave it for the present, and there it\r\nremained for nearly seven years. Mr. Parris probably[i.318] got the\r\nstart of his opponents, in being first to invoke the law. This is what\r\nhe meant when he told his church \"that their way was plain before\r\nthem.\" If extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances had not\r\nintervened, the case would more speedily have been disposed of, and we\r\ncannot doubt what would have been its issue. Whatever might be the bias\r\nor prejudice of the courts, or however they might have attempted to\r\nenforce their first decisions, there can be no question, that, in such\r\na contest, the people would have finally prevailed. The committee were\r\nmen competent to carry the parish through. A religious society, with\r\nsuch feelings between them and their minister, after all that had\r\nhappened, and the just grounds given them of dissatisfaction and\r\nresentment, could not always, or long, have been kept under such an\r\ninfliction.\r\n\r\nIn the immediately preceding entries, there are some points that\r\nillustrate the policy on which Mr. Parris acted, and exhibit the skill\r\nand vigilance of his management. The motive that led him to harp so\r\nconstantly upon \"firewood\" is obvious. It was to create a sympathy in\r\nhis behalf, and bring opprobrium upon his opponents. But it cannot\r\nstand the test of scrutiny: for it had been expressly agreed, as I have\r\nsaid, that he should find his own fuel; and it cannot be supposed that\r\nhis friends, if he then had any real ones, surrounded, as they were,\r\nwith forests of their own, within sight of the parsonage, would have\r\nallowed him to suffer from this cause. There is indication[i.319] that\r\nthe \"brethren of the church\" were getting lukewarm, as their\r\nnon-attendance at important meetings led Mr. Parris to fear. At any\r\nrate, he felt it necessary to administer some rather significant\r\nrebukes to them. The meeting for prayer, preparatory to the ensuing\r\ncommunion service, was very adroitly converted into a business\r\nconsultation to inaugurate a lawsuit. But the most characteristic\r\nthing, in this part of the church-book, is a marginal entry, against\r\nthe first paragraph of the record of the 2d November, 1691. It is in\r\nthese words:—\r\n\r\n\"The town-meeting, about or at 16th October last. Jos: Porter, Jos:\r\nHutchinson, Jos: Putnam, Dan: Andrew, Francis Nurse.\"\r\n\r\nThese were the committee appointed at the meeting. Their names, thus\r\nabbreviated, are given, and not a syllable added. But the manner, the\r\nthen state of things, and their relation to the controversy, give a\r\ndeep import and intense bitterness to this entry. He knew the men, and\r\nin their names read the handwriting on the wall.\r\n\r\nBut a turn was soon given to the current that was bearing Mr. Parris\r\ndown. A power was evoked—whether he raised it designedly, or whether it\r\nmerely happened to appear on the scene, we cannot certainly say; but it\r\ncame into action just at the nick of time—which instantly reversed the\r\nposition of the parties, and clothed him with a terrible strength,\r\nenabling him to crush his opponents beneath his feet. In a few\r\nshort[i.320] months, he was the arbiter of life and death of all the\r\npeople of the village and the country. \"Jos: Porter and Jos:\r\nHutchinson\" escaped. The power of destruction broke down before it\r\nbecame strong enough to reach them perhaps. \"Jos: Putnam\" was kept for\r\nsix months in the constant peril of his life. During all that time, he\r\nand his family were armed, and kept watch. \"Dan: Andrew\" saved himself\r\nfrom the gallows by flight to a foreign land. The unutterable woes\r\nbrought upon the family of \"Francis Nurse\" remain to be related.\r\n\r\nThe witchcraft delusion at Salem Village, in 1692, has attracted\r\nuniversal attention, constitutes a permanent chapter in the world's\r\nhistory, and demands a full exposition, and, if possible, a true\r\nsolution. Being convinced that it cannot be correctly interpreted\r\nwithout a thorough knowledge of the people among whom it appeared, I\r\nhave felt it indispensable, before opening its scenes to view, or\r\ntreating the subject of demonology, of which it was an outgrowth, in\r\nthe first place to prepare myself, and those who accompany me in its\r\nexamination and discussion, to fully comprehend it, by traversing the\r\nground over which we have now passed. By a thorough history of Salem\r\nVillage from its origin to the period of our story, by calling its\r\nfounders and their children and successors into life before you by\r\npersonal, private, domestic, and local details, gleaned from old\r\nrecords and documents, I have tried to place you at the standpoint from\r\nwhich the entire occurrence can be intelligibly contemplated. We can in\r\nno other[i.321] way get a true view of a passage of history than by\r\nlooking at the men who acted in it, as they really were. We must\r\nunderstand their characters, enter into their life, see with their\r\neyes, feel with their hearts, and be enveloped, as it were, with their\r\nassociations, sentiments, beliefs, and principles of action. In this\r\nway only can we bring the past into our presence, comprehend its\r\nelements, fathom its depths, read its meaning, or receive its lessons.\r\n\r\nI am confident you will agree with me, that it was not because the\r\npeople of Salem Village were more ignorant, stupid, or weak-minded than\r\nthe people of other places, that the delusion made its appearance or\r\nheld its sway among them. This is a vital point to the just\r\nconsideration of the subject. I do not mean justice to them so much as\r\nto ourselves and all who wish to understand, and be benefited by\r\nunderstanding, the subject. There never was a community composed\r\noriginally of better materials, or better trained in all good usages.\r\nAlthough the generations subsequent to the first had not enjoyed, to\r\nany considerable extent, the advantages of education, the circumstances\r\nof their experience had kept their faculties in the fullest exercise.\r\nThey were an energetic and intelligent people. Their moral condition,\r\nsocial intercourse, manners, and personal bearing, were excellent. The\r\nlesson of the catastrophe impending over them, at the point to which we\r\nhave arrived, can only be truly and fully received, for the warning of\r\nall coming time, by having correct views on this point. The\r\ndelusion[i.322] that brought ruin upon them was not the result of any\r\nessential inferiority in their moral or intellectual condition. What we\r\ncall their ignorance was the received philosophy and wisdom of the day,\r\naccepted generally by the great scholars of that and previous ages,\r\npreached from the pulpits, taught in the universities, recognized in\r\nlaw and in medicine as well as theology, and carried out in the\r\nproceedings of public tribunals and legislative assemblies.\r\n\r\nThe history of the planting, settlement, and progress of Salem Village,\r\nto 1692, has now been given. We know, so far as existing materials\r\nwithin reach enable us to know, what sort of a population occupied the\r\nplace at the date of our story. Their descent, breeding, and\r\nexperiences have been related. They were, at least, equal in\r\nintelligence to any of the people of their day. They were strenuous in\r\naction, trained to earnestness and zeal, accustomed to become deeply\r\nengaged in whatever interested them, and to take strong hold of the\r\nideas and sentiments they received. It becomes necessary, therefore, in\r\nthe next place, to ascertain what their ideas were in reference to\r\nwitchcraft, diabolical agency, and supernaturalism generally. I shall\r\nproceed accordingly to give the condition of opinion, at that time, on\r\nthe subject of demonology.\r\n\r\n\r\n[i.323]\r\n\r\ndecoration\r\n\r\nPART SECOND.\r\n\r\n decoration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[i.325]\r\n\r\nPART SECOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITCHCRAFT.\r\n\r\nDEMONOLOGY, as a general term, may be employed, for convenience, to\r\ninclude a whole class of ideas—which, under different names and a vast\r\nvariety of conceptions, have come through all ages, and prevailed among\r\nall races of mankind—relating to the supposed agency of supernatural,\r\ninvisible, and spiritual beings in terrestrial affairs. As necessarily\r\napplicable to evil spirits, particularly to the arch-enemy and supreme\r\nadversary of God and man under the name of Satan or the Devil, the term\r\ndoes not appear to have been used in ancient times. Professed\r\ncommunications with supernatural beings were not originally stamped\r\nwith a diabolical character, but, like some alleged to be had in our\r\nday, were regarded as innocent, and even creditable. Men sought to hold\r\nintercourse with spirits belonging to the unseen world, as some persons\r\ndo now; assuming that they were worthy of confidence, and that\r\nresponses from[i.326] them were valuable and desirable. This was the\r\ncase under the reign of classical mythology, and of heathen\r\nsuperstition in general. Those individuals who were supposed to be\r\nconversant with demons were looked upon by the credulous multitude as a\r\nhighly privileged class; and they arrogated the credit of being raised\r\nto a higher sphere of knowledge than the rest of mankind.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most remarkable peculiarities of the Hebrew polity,\r\nthat it denounced such pretended communications as criminal, and\r\nsubjected the practice to the highest penalties. It was assumed to be\r\ndangerous; the welfare of individuals and of society requiring that\r\nsuch pretensions and practices should be abandoned. The observation and\r\nexperience of mankind have justified this view. In the first ages of\r\nChristianity, it was believed that the Divine Being alone was to be\r\nsought in prayer for light and guidance by the human soul. Gradually,\r\nas the dark ages began to settle upon Christendom, the doctrine of the\r\nDevil as the head and ruler of a world of demons, and as able to hold\r\ncommunications with mortals, to interfere in their affairs, and to\r\nexercise more or less control over the laws and phenomena of nature,\r\nbegan to become prevalent. It was believed that human beings could\r\nenter into alliance with the Prince of the power of the air; become his\r\nconfederates; join in a league with him and wicked spirits subordinate\r\nto him, in undermining the Gospel and overthrowing the Church; and\r\nconspire and co-operate[i.327] in rebellion against God. This, of\r\ncourse, was regarded as the most flagrant of crimes, and constituted\r\nthe real character of the sin denominated \"witchcraft.\"\r\n\r\nAs the fullest, most memorable, and, by the notice it has ever since\r\nattracted throughout the world, the pre-eminent instance and\r\ndemonstration of this supposed iniquity was in the crisis that took\r\nplace in Salem Village in 1692, it justly claims a place in history.\r\nThe community in which it occurred has been fully described, in its\r\nmoral, social, and intellectual condition, so far as the materials I\r\nhave been enabled to obtain have rendered possible. It has, I believe,\r\nbeen made to appear, that, in their training, experience, and traits of\r\ncharacter, they were well adapted to give full effect to any\r\nexcitement, or earnest action of any kind, that could be got up among\r\nthem,—a people of great energy, courage, and resolution, well prepared\r\nto carry out to its natural and legitimate results any movement, and\r\nfollow established convictions fearlessly to logical conclusions. The\r\nexperiment of bringing supernaturalism to operate in human affairs, to\r\nbecome a ground of action in society, and to interfere in the relations\r\nof life and the dealings of men with each other, was as well tried upon\r\nthis people as it ever could or can be anywhere.\r\n\r\nAll that remains to be brought to view, before entering upon the\r\ndetails of the narrative, is to give a just and adequate idea of the\r\nform and shape in which the general subject of supernaturalism, in its\r\naspect as demonology, lay in the minds of men here at that[i.328] time.\r\nTo do this, I must give a sketch, as condensed and brief as I can make\r\nit, of the formation and progress of opinions and notions touching the\r\nsubject, until they reached their full demonstration and final\r\nexplosion, in this neighborhood, at Salem Village, near the close of\r\nthe seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nNo person who looks around him on the scene in which he is placed,\r\nreflects upon the infinite wonders of creation, and meditates upon the\r\nequal wonders of his own mind, can be at a loss respecting the sources\r\nand causes of superstition. Let him transport himself back to the\r\ncondition of a primitive and unlettered people, before whom the world\r\nappears in all its original and sublime mystery. Science has not lifted\r\nto their eyes the curtain behind which the secret operations of nature\r\nare carried on. They observe the tides rise and fall, but know not the\r\nattractive law that regulates their movements; they contemplate the\r\nprocession of the seasons, without any conception of the principles and\r\ncauses that determine and produce their changes; they witness the storm\r\nas it rises in its wrath; they listen with awe to the thunder-peal, and\r\ngaze with startling terror upon the lightning as it flashes from within\r\nthe bosom of the black cloud, and are utterly ignorant to what power to\r\nattribute the dreadful phenomena; they look upward to the face of the\r\nsky, and see the myriad starry hosts that glitter there, and all is to\r\nthem a mighty maze of dazzling confusion. It is for their fancy to\r\nexplain, interpret, and fill up the brilliant and magnificent\r\nscene.[i.329]\r\n\r\nThe imagination was the faculty the exercise of which was chiefly\r\ncalled for in such a state as this. Before science had traced the\r\noperations and unfolded the secrets of nature, man was living in a\r\nworld full of marvel and mystery. His curiosity was attracted to every\r\nobject within the reach of his senses; and, in the absence of\r\nknowledge, it was imagination alone that could make answer to its\r\ninquiries. It is natural to suppose that he would be led to attribute\r\nall the movements and operations of the external world which did not\r\nappear to be occasioned by the exercise of his own power, or the power\r\nof any other animal, to the agency of supernatural beings. We may also\r\nconclude, that his belief would not be likely to fix upon the notion of\r\na single overruling Being. Although revelation and science have\r\ndisclosed to us a beautiful and entire unity and harmony in the\r\ncreation, the phenomena of the external world would probably impress\r\nthe unenlightened and unphilosophic observer with the belief that there\r\nwas a diversity in the powers which caused them. He would imagine the\r\nagency of a being of an amiable and beneficent spirit in the bright\r\nsunshine, the fresh breeze, and the mild moonlight; and his fancy would\r\nsuggest to his fears, that a dark, severe, and terrible being was in\r\nthe ascendant during a day overshadowed by frowning clouds, or a night\r\nblack with the storm and torn by the tempest.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of such reflections as these, we are easily conducted to a\r\nsatisfactory and sufficient explanation of the origin of the mythology\r\nand fabulous super[i.330]stitions of all ancient and primitive nations.\r\nFrom this the progress is plain, obvious, and immediate to the\r\npretensions of magicians, diviners, sorcerers, conjurers, oracles,\r\nsoothsayers, augurs, and the whole catalogue of those persons who\r\nprofessed to hold intercourse with higher and spiritual powers. There\r\nare several classes into which they may be divided.\r\n\r\nThere were those who, to acquire an influence over the people,\r\npretended to possess the confidence, and enjoy the friendship and\r\ncounsel, of some one or more deities. Such was Numa, the early lawgiver\r\nof the Roman State. In order to induce the people to adopt the\r\nregulations, institutions, and religious rites he proposed, he made\r\nthem believe that he had access to a divinity, and received all his\r\nplans and ideas as a communication from on high.\r\n\r\nPersons who, in consequence of their superior acquirements, were\r\nenabled to excel others in any pursuit, or who could foresee and avail\r\nthemselves of events in the natural world, were liable, without any\r\nintention to deceive, to be classed under some of these denominations.\r\nFor instance, a Roman farmer, Furius Cresinus, surpassed all his\r\nneighbors in the skill and success with which he managed his\r\nagricultural affairs. He was accordingly accused of using magic arts in\r\nthe operations of his farm. So far were his neighbors carried by their\r\nfeelings of envy and jealousy, that they explained the fact of his\r\nbeing able to derive more produce from a small lot of land than they\r\ncould from large ones, by charging him[i.331] with attracting and\r\ndrawing off the productions of their fields into his own by the\r\nemployment of certain mysterious charms. For his defence, as we are\r\ninformed by Pliny, he produced his strong and well-constructed ploughs,\r\nhis light and convenient spades, and his sun-burnt daughters, and\r\npointing to them exclaimed: \"Here are my charms; this is my magic;\r\nthese only are the witchcraft I have used.\" Zoroaster, the great\r\nphilosopher and astronomer of the ancient East, was charged with\r\ndivination and magic, merely, it is probable, because he possessed\r\nuncommon acquirements.\r\n\r\nThere were persons who had acquired an extraordinary amount of natural\r\nknowledge, and, for the sake of being regarded with wonder and awe by\r\nthe people, pretended to obtain their superior endowments from\r\nsupernatural beings. They affected the name and character of sorcerers,\r\ndiviners, and soothsayers. It is easy to conceive of the early\r\nexistence and the great influence of such impostors. Patient\r\nobservation, and often mere accident, would suggest discoveries of the\r\nexistence and operation of natural causes in producing phenomena before\r\nascribed to superhuman agency. The knowledge thus acquired would be\r\ncautiously concealed, and cunningly used, to create astonishment and\r\nwin admiration. Its fortunate possessors were enabled to secure the\r\nconfidence, obedience, and even reverence, of the benighted and\r\ndeceived people.\r\n\r\nEvery one, indeed, who could discover a secret of[i.332] nature, and\r\nkeep it secret, was able to impose himself on the world as being allied\r\nwith supernatural powers. Hence arose the whole host of diviners,\r\nastrologers, soothsayers, and oracles. After having once acquired\r\npossession of the credulous faith of the people, they could impose upon\r\nthem almost without limit.\r\n\r\nThose who pretended to hold this kind of intercourse with divinity\r\nbecame, as a natural consequence, the priests of the nation,\r\nconstituted a distinct and regular profession, and perpetuated their\r\nbody by the admission of new members, to whom they explained their\r\narts, and communicated their knowledge. While they were continually\r\ndiscovering and applying the secret principles and laws of nature, and\r\nthe people were kept in utter ignorance and darkness, it is no wonder\r\nthat they reached a great and unparalleled degree of power over the\r\nmass of the population. In this manner we account for the origin, and\r\ntrace the history, of the Chaldean priests in Assyria, the Bramins of\r\nIndia, the Magi of Persia, the Oracles of Greece, the Augurs of Italy,\r\nthe Druids of Britain, and the Pow-wows, Prophets, or \"Medicins,\" as\r\nthey sometimes called them, among our Indians.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the witches mentioned in the Scriptures were of\r\nthis description. Neither in sacred nor profane ancient history do we\r\nfind what was understood in the days of our ancestors by witchcraft,\r\nwhich meant a formal and actual compact with the great Prince of evil\r\nbeings. The sorcery of antiquity[i.333] consisted in pretending to\r\npossess certain mysterious charms, and to do by their means, or by the\r\nco-operation of superhuman spirits, without any reference to their\r\ncharacter as evil or good beings, what transcends the action of mere\r\nnatural powers.\r\n\r\nThe witch of Endor, for instance, was a conjurer and necromancer,\r\nrather than a witch. By referring to the 28th chapter of 1 Samuel,\r\nwhere the interview between her and Saul is related, you will find no\r\nground for the opinion that the being from whom she pretended to\r\nreceive her mysterious power was Satan. Saul, as the ruler of a people\r\nwho were under the special government, and enjoyed the peculiar\r\nprotection of the true God, had forbidden, under the sanction of the\r\nhighest penalties, the exercise of the arts of divination and sorcery\r\nwithin his jurisdiction. Some time after this, the unfortunate monarch\r\nwas overtaken by trouble and distress. His enemies had risen up, and\r\nwere gathered in fearful strength around him. His \"heart greatly\r\ntrembled,\" a dark and gloomy presentiment came over his spirit, and his\r\nbosom was convulsed by an agony of solicitude. He turned toward his God\r\nfor light and strength. He applied for relief to the priests of the\r\naltar, and to the prophets of the Most High; but his prayers were\r\nunanswered, and his efforts vain. In his sorrow and apprehension, he\r\nappealed to a woman who was reputed to have supernatural powers, and to\r\nhold communion with spiritual beings; thus violating his own law, and\r\ndeparting from duty and fidelity to his God. He[i.334] begged her to\r\nrecall Samuel to life, that he might be comforted and instructed by\r\nhim. She pretended to comply with his request; but, before she could\r\ncommence her usual mysterious operations, Samuel arose! and the\r\nforlorn, wretched, and heart-broken king listened to his tremendous\r\ndoom, as it was uttered by the spirit of the departed prophet.\r\n\r\nI have alluded particularly to the witch of Endor, because she will\r\nserve to illustrate the sorcery or divination of antiquity. She was\r\nprobably possessed of some secret knowledge of natural properties; was\r\nskilful in the use of her arts and pretended charms; had, perhaps, the\r\npeculiar powers of a ventriloquist; and, by successful imposture, had\r\nacquired an uncommon degree of notoriety, and the entire confidence of\r\nthe public. She professed to be in alliance with supernatural beings,\r\nand, by their assistance, to raise the dead.\r\n\r\nThis passage has afforded a topic for a great deal of discussion among\r\ninterpreters. It seems to me, on the face of the narrative, to suggest\r\nthe following view of the transaction: The woman was an impostor. When\r\nshe summoned the spirit of Samuel, instead of the results of her magic\r\nlantern, or of whatever contrivances she may have had, by the immediate\r\nagency of the Almighty the spirit of Samuel really rose, to the\r\nconsternation and horror of the pretended necromancer. The writer\r\nappears to have indicated this as the proper interpretation of the\r\nscene, by saying, \"that, when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a\r\nloud[i.335] voice;\" thus giving evidence of alarm and surprise totally\r\ndifferent from the deportment of such pretenders on such occasions:\r\nthey used rather to exhibit joy at the success of their arts, and a\r\nproud composure and dignified complacency in the control they were\r\nbelieved to exercise over the spirits that appeared to have obeyed\r\ntheir call. Sir Walter Scott took this view of the transaction. His\r\nopinion, it is true, would be considered more important in any other\r\ndepartment than that of biblical interpretation: on all questions,\r\nhowever, connected with the spiritual world of fancy and with its\r\nhistory, he must be allowed to speak, if not with the authority, at\r\nleast with the tone of a master. This wonderful author, in the infinite\r\nprofusion and variety of his productions, published a volume upon\r\nDemonology and Witchcraft: it is, of course, entertaining and\r\ninstructive to all who are curious to know the capacity and to\r\nappreciate the operations of the human imagination.\r\n\r\nIt will be regarded by intelligent and judicious persons as a\r\ncircumstance of importance in reference to the view now given of the\r\ntransaction in which the witch of Endor acts the leading part, that\r\nHugh Farmer, beyond all question the most learned, discreet, and\r\nprofound writer on such subjects, is inclined to throw the weight of\r\nhis authority in its favor. His ample and elaborate discussion of the\r\nquestion is to be seen in his work on Miracles, chap. iv. sec. 2.\r\n\r\nAmong the heathen nations of antiquity, the art of divination\r\nconsisted, to a great degree, in the magical[i.336] use of mysterious\r\ncharms. Many plants were considered as possessed of wonderful virtues,\r\nand there was scarcely a limit to the supposed power of those persons\r\nwho knew how to use and apply them skilfully. Virgil, in his eighth\r\neclogue, thus speaks of this species of sorcery:—\r\n\r\n\"These herbs did Moeris give to me\r\nAnd poisons pluckt at Pontus;\r\nFor there they grow and multiplie\r\nAnd do not so amongst us:\r\nWith these she made herselfe become\r\nA wolfe, and hid hir in the wood;\r\nShe fetcht up souls out of their toome,\r\nRemoving corne from where it stood.\"\r\n\r\nIn the fourth Æneid, the lovesick Tyrian queen is thus made to describe\r\nthe magic which was then believed to be practised:—\r\n\r\n\"Rejoice,\" she said: \"instructed from above,\r\nMy lover I shall gain, or lose my love;\r\nNigh rising Atlas, next the falling sun\r\nLong tracts of Ethiopian climates run:\r\nThere a Massylian priestess I have found,\r\nHonored for age, for magic arts renowned:\r\nThe Hesperian temple was her trusted care;\r\n'Twas she supplied the wakeful dragon's fare;\r\nShe, poppy-seeds in honey taught to steep,\r\nReclaimed his rage, and soothed him into sleep;\r\nShe watched the golden fruit. Her charms unbind\r\nThe chains of love, or fix them on the mind;\r\nShe stops the torrent, leaves the channel dry,\r\nRepels the stars, and backward bears the sky.\r\nThe yawning earth rebellows to her call,\r\nPale ghosts ascend, and mountain ashes fall.\"\r\n[i.337]\r\n\r\nTibullus, in the second elegy of his first book, gives the following\r\naccount of the powers ascribed to a magician:—\r\n\r\n\"She plucks each star out of his throne,\r\nAnd turneth back the raging waves;\r\nWith charms she makes the earth to cone,\r\nAnd raiseth souls out of their graves;\r\nShe burns men's bones as with a fire,\r\nAnd pulleth down the lights of Heaven,\r\nAnd makes it snow at her desire\r\nE'en in the midst of summer season.\"\r\n\r\nThese views continued to hold undisturbed dominion over the people\r\nduring a long succession of centuries. As the twilight of the dark ages\r\nbegan to settle upon Christendom, superstition, that night-blooming\r\nplant, extended itself rapidly, and in all directions, over the surface\r\nof the world. While every thing else drooped and withered, it struck\r\ndeeper its roots, spread wider its branches, and brought forth more\r\nabundantly its fruit. The unnumbered fables of Greek and Roman\r\nmythology, the arts of augury and divination, the visions of oriental\r\nromance, the fanciful and attenuated theories of the later philosophy,\r\nthe abstract and spiritual doctrines of Platonism, and all the grosser\r\nand wilder conceptions of the northern conquerors of the Roman Empire,\r\nbecame mingled together in the faith of the inhabitants of the European\r\nkingdoms. From this multifarious combination, the infinitely\r\ndiversified popular superstitions of the modern nations have sprung.\r\n\r\nWe first begin to trace the clear outlines of the doc[i.338]trine of\r\nwitchcraft not far from the commencement of the Christian era. It\r\npresupposes the belief of the Devil. I shall not enter upon the\r\nquestion, whether the Scriptures, properly interpreted, require the\r\nbelief of the existence of such a being. Directing our attention solely\r\nto profane sources of information, we discover the heathen origin of\r\nthe belief of the existence of the Devil in the ancient systems of\r\noriental philosophy. Early observers of nature in the East were led to\r\nthe conclusion, that the world was a divided empire, ruled by the\r\nalternate or simultaneous energy of two great antagonist principles or\r\nbeings, one perfectly good, and the other perfectly bad. It was for a\r\nlong time, and perhaps is at this day, a prevalent faith among\r\nChristians, that the Bible teaches a similar doctrine; that it\r\npresents, to our adoration and obedience, a being of infinite\r\nperfections in the Deity; and to our abhorrence and our fears, a being\r\ninfinitely wicked, and of great power, in the Devil.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, that, when the entire enginery of supernaturalism was\r\norganized in adaptation to the idea of the Devil, and demonology became\r\nsynonymous with diabolism, the credulity and superstition of mankind\r\nwould give a wide extension to that form of belief. It soon occupied a\r\nlarge space in the theories of religion and the fancies of the people,\r\nand got to be a leading element in the life of society. It made its\r\nimpress on the forms of speech, and many of the phrases to which it\r\ngave rise still remain in familiar use. It figured in the rituals of\r\nreligion, in the paraphernalia of public shows,[i.339] and in fireside\r\ntales. It afforded leading characters to the drama in the miracle plays\r\nand the moral plays, as they were called, at successive periods. It\r\noffered a ready weapon to satire, and also to defamation. Gerbert, a\r\nnative of France, who was elevated to the pontificate about the close\r\nof the tenth century, under the name of Sylvester II., is eulogized by\r\nMosheim as the first great restorer of science and literature. He was a\r\nperson of an extensive and sublime genius, of wonderful attainments in\r\nlearning, particularly mathematics, geometry, and arithmetic. He broke\r\nthe profound sleep of the dark ages, and awakened the torpid intellect\r\nof the European nations. His efforts in this direction roused the\r\napprehensions and resentment of the monks; and they circulated, after\r\nGerbert's death, and made the ignorant masses believe the story, that\r\nhe had obtained his rapid promotion in the Church by the practice of\r\nthe black art, which he disguised under the show of learning; that he\r\nsecured the Archbishopric of Ravenna by bribery and corruption; and\r\nthat, finally, he made a bargain with Satan, promising him his soul\r\nafter death, on condition that he (Satan) should put forth his great\r\ninfluence over the cardinals in such a manner as would secure his\r\nelection to the throne of St. Peter. The arrangement was carried into\r\nsuccessful operation. Sylvester, the monks averred, consulted the Devil\r\nthrough the medium of a brazen head during his whole reign, and enjoyed\r\nhis faithful friendship and unwavering patronage. But, when His\r\nHoliness came to die, he endeavored to defraud Satan[i.340] of his\r\nrightful claim to his soul, by repenting, and acknowledging his sin.\r\nThis illustrates the way in which the popular idea of the Devil was\r\nused to awaken ridicule and gratify malignity.\r\n\r\nThe natural and ultimate effect of the diffusion of Christianity was to\r\noverthrow, or rather to revolutionize, the whole system of incantation\r\nand sorcery.\r\n\r\nIn heathen countries, as in the East at present and with those among us\r\nwho profess to hold communications with spirits, no reproach or\r\nsentiment of disapprobation, as has already been observed, was\r\nnecessarily connected with the arts of divination; for the supernatural\r\nbeings with whom intercourse was alleged to be had were not, with a few\r\nexceptions, regarded as evil beings. The persons who were thought to be\r\nskilful in their use were, on the contrary, held in great esteem, and\r\nlooked upon with reverence. Magicians and philosophers were convertible\r\nand synonymous terms. Learned and scientific men were induced to\r\nencourage, and turn to their own advantage, the popular credulity that\r\nascribed their extraordinary skill to their connection with spiritual\r\nand divine beings. At length, however, they found themselves placed in\r\na very uncomfortable predicament by the prevalence of the new theology.\r\nIt was exceedingly difficult to dispel the delusion, and correct the\r\nerror they had previously found it for their interest to perpetuate in\r\nthe minds of the community. They could not convince them that their\r\nknowledge was acquired from natural sources, or their operations[i.341]\r\nconducted solely by the aid of natural causes and laws. The people\r\nwould not surrender the belief, that the results of scientific\r\nexperiments, and the accuracy of predictions of physical phenomena,\r\nwere secured by the assistance of supernatural beings.\r\n\r\nAs the doctrines of the gospel gradually undermined the popular belief\r\nin other spiritual beings inferior to the Deity, and were at the same\r\ntime supposed to teach the existence and extensively diffused energy of\r\nan almost infinite and omnipotent agent of evil, it was exceedingly\r\nnatural, nay, it necessarily followed, that the credulity and\r\nsuperstition which had led to the supposition of an alliance between\r\nphilosophers and spiritual beings should settle down into a full\r\nconviction that the Devil was the being with whom they were thus\r\nconfederated. The consequence was that they were charged with\r\nwitchcraft, and many fell victims to the general prejudice and\r\nabhorrence occasioned by the imputation. The influence of this state of\r\nthings was soon seen: it was one of the most effectual causes of the\r\nrapid diffusion of knowledge in modern times. Philosophers and men of\r\nscience became as anxious to explain and publish their discoveries as\r\nthey had been in former ages to conceal and cover them with mystery.\r\nThe following instances will be sufficient to illustrate the\r\ncorrectness of these views.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century, Roger Bacon was charged with witchcraft on\r\naccount of his discoveries in optics, chemistry, and astronomy; and,\r\nalthough he did what[i.342] he could to circulate and explain his own\r\nacquirements, he could not escape a papal denunciation, and two long\r\nand painful imprisonments. In 1305, Arnold de Villa Nova, a learned\r\nphysician and philosopher, was burned at Padua, by order of\r\ninquisitors, on the charge of witchcraft. He was eighty years of age.\r\nTen years afterwards, Peter Apon, also of Padua, who had made\r\nextraordinary progress in knowledge, was accused of the same crime, and\r\ncondemned to death, but expired previous to the time appointed for his\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nI will now present a brief sketch of the most noticeable facts relating\r\nto the subject in Europe and Great Britain previous to the close of the\r\nseventeenth century. Some writers have computed that thirty thousand\r\npersons were executed for this supposed crime, within one hundred and\r\nfifty years. It will of course be in my power to mention only a few\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nIn 1484, Pope Innocent the Eighth issued a bull encouraging and\r\nrequiring the arrest and punishment of persons suspected of witchcraft.\r\nFrom this moment, the prosecutions became frequent and the victims\r\nnumerous in every country. The very next year, forty-one aged females\r\nwere consigned to the flames in one nation; and, not long after, a\r\nhundred were burned by one inquisition in the devoted valleys of\r\nPiedmont; forty-eight were burned in Ravensburg in five years; and, in\r\nthe year 1515, five hundred were burned at Geneva in three months! One\r\nwriter de[i.343]clares that \"almost an infinite number\" were burned for\r\nwitchcraft in France,—a thousand in a single diocese! These sanguinary\r\nand horrible transactions were promoted and sanctioned by theological\r\nhatred and rancor. It was soon perceived that there was no kind of\r\ndifficulty in clearing the Church of heretics by hanging or burning\r\nthem all as witches! The imputation of witchcraft could be fixed upon\r\nany one with the greatest facility. In the earlier part of the\r\nfifteenth century, the Earl of Bedford, having taken the celebrated\r\nJoan of Arc prisoner, put her to death on this charge. She had been\r\nalmost adored by the people rescued by her romantic valor, and was\r\nuniversally known among them by the venerable title of \"Holy Maid of\r\nGod;\" but no difficulty was experienced in procuring evidence enough to\r\nlead her to the stake as a servant and confederate of Satan! Luther was\r\njust beginning his attack upon the papal power, and he was instantly\r\naccused of being in confederacy with the Devil.\r\n\r\nIn 1534, Elizabeth Barton, \"the Maid of Kent,\" was executed for\r\nwitchcraft in England, together with seven men who had been confederate\r\nwith her. In 1541 the Earl of Hungerford was beheaded for inquiring of\r\na witch how long Henry VIII. would live. In 1549 it was made the duty\r\nof bishops, by Archbishop Cranmer's articles of visitation, to inquire\r\nof their clergy, whether \"they know of any that use charms, sorcery,\r\nenchantments, witchcraft, soothsaying, or any like craft invented by\r\nthe Devil.\" In 1563[i.344] the King of Sweden carried four witches with\r\nhim, as a part of his armament, to aid him in his wars with the Danes.\r\nIn 1576, seventeen or eighteen were condemned in Essex, in England. A\r\nsingle judge or inquisitor, Remigius, condemned and burned nine hundred\r\nwithin fifteen years, from 1580 to 1595, in the single district of\r\nLorraine; and as many more fled out of the country; whole villages were\r\ndepopulated, and fifteen persons destroyed themselves rather than\r\nsubmit to the torture which, under the administration of this successor\r\nof Draco and rival of Jeffries, was the first step taken in the trial\r\nof an accused person. The application of the rack and other instruments\r\nof torment, in the examination of prisoners, was recommended by him in\r\na work on witchcraft. He observes that \"scarcely any one was known to\r\nbe brought to repentance and confession but by these means\"!\r\n\r\nThe most eminent persons of the sixteenth century were believers in the\r\npopular superstition respecting the existence of compacts between Satan\r\nand human beings, and in the notions associated with it. The excellent\r\nMelancthon was an interpreter of dreams and caster of nativities.\r\nLuther was a strenuous supporter of the doctrine of witchcraft, and\r\nseems to have seriously believed that he had had frequent interviews\r\nwith the arch-enemy himself, and had disputed with him on points of\r\ntheology, face to face. In his \"Table-Talk,\" he gives the following\r\naccount of his intimacy with the Devil: speaking of his confinement in\r\nthe Castle of Wartburg, he says, \"Among other things[i.345] they\r\nbrought me hazel-nuts, which I put into a box, and sometimes I used to\r\ncrack and eat of them. In the night-times, my gentleman, the Devil,\r\ncame and got the nuts out of the box, and cracked them against one of\r\nthe bedposts, making a very great noise and rumbling about my bed; but\r\nI regarded him nothing at all: when afterwards I began to slumber, then\r\nhe kept such a racket and rumbling upon the chamber stairs, as if many\r\nempty barrels and hogsheads had been tumbled down.\" Kepler, whose name\r\nis immortalized by being associated with the laws he discovered that\r\nregulate the orbits of the heavenly bodies, was a zealous advocate of\r\nastrology; and his great predecessor and master, the Prince of\r\nAstronomers, as he is called, Tycho Brahe, kept an idiot in his\r\npresence, fed him from his own table, with his own hand, and listened\r\nto his incoherent, unmeaning, and fatuous expressions as to a\r\nrevelation from the spiritual world.\r\n\r\nThe following is the language addressed to Queen Elizabeth by Bishop\r\nJewell. He was one of the most learned persons of his age, and is to\r\nthis day regarded as the mighty champion of the Church of England, and\r\nof the cause of the Reformation in Great Britain. He was the terrible\r\nfoe of Roman-Catholic superstition. \"It may please Your Grace,\" says\r\nhe, \"to understand that witches and sorcerers within these four last\r\nyears are marvellously increased within Your Grace's realm; Your\r\nGrace's subjects pine away even unto the death; their color fadeth,\r\ntheir flesh rotteth, their speech is benumbed, their senses are bereft.\r\nI[i.346] pray God,\" continues the courtly preacher, \"they never\r\npractise further than upon the subject.\" The petition of the polite\r\nprelate appears to have been answered. The virgin queen resisted\r\ninexorably the arts of all charmers, and is thought never to have been\r\nbewitched in her life.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Spenser, in his \"Faërie Queen,\" has described with\r\naccuracy the witch of the sixteenth century in the following beautiful\r\nlines:—\r\n\r\n\"There, in a gloomy hollow glen, she found\r\nA little cottage built of sticks and weedes,\r\nIn homely wise, and wald with sods around,\r\nIn which a witch did dwell in loathly weedes\r\nAnd wilful want, all careless of her needes;\r\nSo choosing solitarie to abide\r\nFar from all neighbors, that her devilish deedes\r\nAnd hellish arts from people she might hide,\r\nAnd hurt far off unknowne whomever she envide.\"\r\n\r\nSo prone were some to indulge in the contemplation of the agency of the\r\nDevil and his myrmidons, that they strained, violated, and perverted\r\nthe language of Scripture to make it speak of them. Thus they insisted\r\nthat the word \"Philistines\" meant confederates and subjects of the\r\nDevil, and accordingly interpreted the expression, \"I will deliver you\r\ninto the hands of the Philistines,\" thus, \"I will deliver you into the\r\nhands of demons.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot describe the extent to which the superstition we are reviewing\r\nwas carried about the close of the sixteenth century in stronger\r\nlanguage than the following, from a candid and learned French\r\nRoman-[i.347]Catholic historian: \"So great folly,\" says he, \"did then\r\noppress the miserable world, that Christians believed greater\r\nabsurdities than could ever be imposed upon the heathens.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at the commencement of the seventeenth century,\r\nwithin which the prosecutions for witchcraft took place in Salem. To\r\nshow the opinions of the clergy of the English Church at this time, I\r\nwill quote the following curious canon, made by the convocation in\r\n1603:—\r\n\r\n\"That no minister or ministers, without license and direction of the\r\nbishop, under his hand and seal obtained, attempt, upon any pretence\r\nwhatsoever, either of possession or obsession, by fasting and prayer,\r\nto cast out any devil or devils, under pain of the imputation of\r\nimposture or cozenage, and deposition from the ministry.\" In the same\r\nyear, licenses were actually granted, as required above, by the Bishop\r\nof Chester; and several ministers were duly authorized by him to cast\r\nout devils!\r\n\r\nDuring this whole century, there were trials and executions for\r\nwitchcraft in all civilized countries. More than two hundred were\r\nhanged in England, thousands were burned in Scotland, and still larger\r\nnumbers in various parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nEdward Fairfax, the poet, was one of the most accomplished men in\r\nEngland. He is celebrated as the translator of Tasso's \"Jerusalem\r\nDelivered,\" in allusion to which work Collins thus speaks of\r\nhim:[i.348]—\r\n\r\n\"How have I sate, while piped the pensive wind,\r\nTo hear thy harp, by British Fairfax strung,\r\nPrevailing poet, whose undoubting mind\r\nBelieved the magic wonders that he sung.\"\r\n\r\nThis same Fairfax prosecuted six of his neighbors for bewitching his\r\nchildren. The trials took place about the time the first pilgrims came\r\nto America.\r\n\r\nIn 1634, Urbain Grandier, a very learned and eminent French minister,\r\nrendered himself odious to the bigoted nuns of Loudun, by his\r\nmoderation towards heretics. Secretly instigated, as has been supposed,\r\nby Cardinal Richelieu, against whom he had written a satire, they\r\npretended to be bewitched by him, and procured his prosecution: he was\r\ntortured upon the rack until he swooned, and then was burned at the\r\nstake. In 1640, Dr. Lamb, of London, was murdered in the streets of\r\nthat city by the mob, on suspicion of witchcraft. Several were hanged\r\nin England, only a few years before the proceedings commenced in Salem.\r\nSome were tried by water ordeal, and drowned in the process, in\r\nSuffolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire, and Northamptonshire, at the very time\r\nthe executions were going on here; and a considerable number of capital\r\npunishments took place in various parts of Great Britain, some years\r\nafter the prosecution had ceased in America.\r\n\r\nThe trials and executions in England and Scotland were attended by\r\ncircumstances as painful, as barbarous, and in all respects as\r\ndisgraceful, as those occurring in Salem. Every species of torture\r\nseems to[i.349] have been resorted to: the principles of reason,\r\njustice, and humanity were set at defiance, and the whole body of the\r\npeople kept in a state of the most fierce excitement against the\r\nsufferers. Indeed, there is nothing more distressing in the\r\ncontemplation of these sanguinary proceedings than the spirit of\r\ndeliberate and unmitigated cruelty with which they were conducted. No\r\nsymptoms of pity, compassion, or sympathy, appear to have been\r\nmanifested by the judges or the community. The following account of the\r\nexpenses attending the execution of two persons convicted of witchcraft\r\nin Scotland, shows in what a cool, business-like style the affair was\r\nmanaged:—\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For ten loads of coal, to burn them     £3     6     8 For a tar\r\nbarrel     0     14     0 For towes     0     6     0 For hurden to be jumps\r\nfor them     3     10     0 For making of them     0     8     0 For one to\r\ngo to Finmouth for the Laird to sit\r\nupon their assize as judge 0 6 0 For the executioner for his\r\npains     8     14     0 For his expenses here     0     16     4\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brutalizing effects of capital punishments are clearly seen in\r\nthese, as in all other instances. They gradually impart a feeling of\r\nindifference to the value of human life, or to the idea of cutting it\r\noff by the hand of violence, to all who become accustomed to the\r\nspectacle. In various ways they exercise influences upon the tone and\r\ntemper of society, which can[i.350]not but be regarded with regret by\r\nthe citizen, the legislator, the moralist, the philanthropist, and the\r\nChristian.\r\n\r\nSinclair, in his work called \"Satan's Invisible World Discovered,\"\r\ngives the following affecting declaration made by one of the confessing\r\nwitches, as she was on her way to the stake:—\r\n\r\n\"Now all you that see me this day know that I am now to die as a witch\r\nby my own confession; and I free all men, especially the ministers and\r\nmagistrates, of the guilt of my blood; I take it wholly upon myself, my\r\nblood be upon my own head: and, as I must make answer to the God of\r\nheaven presently, I declare I am as free of witchcraft as any child;\r\nbut, being delated by a malicious woman, and put in prison under the\r\nname of a witch, disowned by my husband and friends, and seeing no\r\nground of hope of my coming out of prison, or ever coming in credit\r\nagain, through the temptation of the Devil, I made up that confession\r\non purpose to destroy my own life, being weary of it, and choosing\r\nrather to die than live.\"\r\n\r\nSir George Mackenzie says that he went to examine some women who had\r\nconfessed, and that one of them, who was a silly creature, told him,\r\n\"under secresie,\" \"that she had not confessed because she was guilty,\r\nbut, being a poor creature, who wrought for her meat, and being defamed\r\nfor a witch, she knew she would starve, for no person thereafter would\r\neither give her meat or lodging, and that all men would beat her, and\r\nhound dogs at her, and that therefore she[i.351] desired to be out of\r\nthe world.\" Whereupon she wept most bitterly, and, upon her knees,\r\ncalled God to witness to what she said.\r\n\r\nA wretch, named Matthew Hopkins, rendered himself infamously\r\nconspicuous in the prosecutions for witchcraft that took place in the\r\ncounties of Essex, Sussex, Norfolk, and Huntingdon, in England, in the\r\nyears 1645 and 1646. The title he assumed indicates the part he acted:\r\nit was \"Witch-finder-general.\" He travelled from place to place; his\r\nexpenses were paid; and he required, in addition, regular fees for the\r\ndiscovery of a witch. Besides pricking the body to find the witch-mark,\r\nhe compelled the wretched and decrepit victims of his cruel practices\r\nto sit in a painful posture, on an elevated stool, with their limbs\r\ncrossed; and, if they persevered in refusing to confess, he would\r\nprolong their torture, in some cases, to more than twenty-four hours.\r\nHe would prevent their going to sleep, and drag them about barefoot\r\nover the rough ground, thus overcoming them with extreme weariness and\r\npain: but his favorite method was to tie the thumb of the right hand\r\nclose to the great toe of the left foot, and draw them through a river\r\nor pond; if they floated, as they would be likely to do, while their\r\nheavier limbs were thus sustained and upborne by the rope, it was\r\nconsidered as conclusive proof of their guilt. This monster was\r\nencouraged and sanctioned by the government; and he procured the death,\r\nin one year and in one county, of more than three times as many as\r\nsuffered in Salem during the whole delusion. He[i.352] and his exploits\r\nare referred to in the following lines, from that storehouse of good\r\nsense and keen wit, Butler's \"Hudibras:\"—\r\n\r\n\"Hath not this present Parliament\r\nA leiger to the Devil sent,\r\nFully empowered to treat about\r\nFinding revolted witches out?\r\nAnd has he not within a year\r\nHanged threescore of them in one shire?\"\r\n\r\nThe infatuated people looked upon this Hopkins with admiration and\r\nastonishment, and could only account for his success by the\r\nsupposition, which, we are told, was generally entertained, that he had\r\nstolen the memorandum-book in which Satan had recorded the names of all\r\nthe persons in England who were in league with him!\r\n\r\nThe most melancholy circumstance connected with the history of this\r\ncreature is, that Richard Baxter and Edmund Calamy—names dear and\r\nvenerable in the estimation of all virtuous and pious men—were deceived\r\nand deluded by him: they countenanced his conduct, followed him in his\r\nmovements, and aided him in his proceedings.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, some gentlemen, shocked at the cruelty and\r\nsuspicious of the integrity of Hopkins, seized him, tied his thumbs and\r\ntoes together, threw him into a pond, and dragged him about to their\r\nhearts' content. They were fully satisfied with the result of the\r\nexperiment. It was found that he did not sink. He stood condemned on\r\nhis own principles; and thus[i.353] the country was rescued from the\r\npower of the malicious impostor.\r\n\r\nAmong the persons whose death Hopkins procured, was a venerable,\r\ngray-headed clergyman, named Lewis. He was of the Church of England,\r\nhad been the minister of a congregation for more than half a century,\r\nand was over eighty years of age. His infirm frame was subjected to the\r\ncustomary tests, even to the trial by water ordeal: he was compelled to\r\nwalk almost incessantly for several days and nights, until, in the\r\nexhaustion of his nature, he yielded assent to a confession that was\r\nadduced against him in Court; which, however, he disowned and denied\r\nthere and at all times, from the moment of release from the torments,\r\nby which it had been extorted, to his last breath. As he was about to\r\ndie the death of a felon, he knew that the rites of sepulture,\r\naccording to the forms of his denomination, would be denied to his\r\nremains. The aged sufferer, it is related, read his own funeral service\r\nwhile on the scaffold. Solemn, sublime, and affecting as are passages\r\nof this portion of the ritual of the Church, surely it was never\r\nperformed under circumstances so well suited to impress with awe and\r\ntenderness as when uttered by the calumniated, oppressed, and dying old\r\nman. Baxter had been tried for sedition, on the ground that one of his\r\npublications contained a reflection upon Episcopacy, and was imprisoned\r\nfor two years. It is a striking and melancholy illustration of the\r\nmoral infirmity of human nature, that the author of the \"Saints'\r\nEverlast[i.354]ing Rest,\" and the \"Call to the Unconverted,\" permitted\r\nsuch a vengeful feeling against the Establishment to enter his breast,\r\nthat he took pleasure, and almost exulted, in relating the fate of this\r\ninnocent and aged clergyman, whom he denominates, in derision, a\r\n\"Reading Parson.\"\r\n\r\nBaxter's writings are pervaded by his belief in all sorts of\r\nsupernatural things. In the \"Saints' Everlasting Rest,\" he declares his\r\nconviction of the reality and authenticity of stories of ghosts,\r\napparitions, haunted houses, &c. He placed full faith in a tale,\r\ncurrent among the people of his day, of the \"dispossession of the Devil\r\nout of many persons together in a room in Lancashire, at the prayer of\r\nsome godly ministers.\" In his \"Dying Thoughts,\" he says, \"I have had\r\nmany convincing proofs of witches, the contracts they have made with\r\ndevils, and the power which they have received from them;\" and he seems\r\nto have credited the most absurd fables ever invented on the subject by\r\nignorance, folly, or fraud.\r\n\r\nThe case to which he refers, as one of the \"dispossession of devils,\"\r\nmay be found in a tract published in London in 1697, entitled, \"The\r\nSurey Demoniac; or, an Account of Satan's strange and dreadful actings,\r\nin and about the body of Richard Dugdale, of Surey, near Whalley, in\r\nLancashire. And how he was dispossessed by God's blessing on the\r\nFastings and Prayers of divers Ministers and People. The matter of fact\r\nattested by the oaths of several creditable persons, before some of his\r\nMajestie's Justices of the Peace[i.355] in the said county.\" The\r\n\"London Monthly Repository\" (vol. v., 1810) describes the affair as\r\nfollows: \"These dreadful actings of Satan continued above a year;\r\nduring which there was a desperate struggle between him and nine\r\nministers of the gospel, who had undertaken to cast him out, and, for\r\nthat purpose, successively relieved each other in their daily combats\r\nwith him: while Satan tried all his arts to baffle their attempts,\r\ninsulting them with scoffs and raillery, puzzling them sometimes with\r\nGreek and Latin, and threatening them with the effects of his\r\nvengeance, till he was finally vanquished and put to flight by the\r\npersevering prayers and fastings of the said ministers.\"\r\n\r\nNo name in English history is regarded with more respect and\r\nadmiration, by wise and virtuous men, than that of Sir Matthew Hale.\r\nHis character was almost venerated by our ancestors; and it has been\r\nthought that it was the influence of his authority, more than any thing\r\nelse, that prevailed upon them to pursue the course they adopted in the\r\nprosecutions at Salem. This great and good man presided, as Lord Chief\r\nBaron, at the trial of two females,—Amy Dunny and Rose Cullender,—at\r\nBury St. Edmunds, in Suffolk, in the year 1664. They were convicted and\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nBaxter relates the following circumstance as having occurred at this\r\ntrial: \"A godly minister, yet living, sitting by to see one of the\r\ngirls (who appeared as a witness against the prisoners) in her fits,\r\nsuddenly felt a force pull one of the hooks from his breeches; and,\r\nwhile he looked with wonder at what was become[i.356] of it, the\r\ntormented girl vomited it up out of her mouth.\"\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of the nature of the testimony upon which the principal\r\nstress was laid by the government, I will extract the following\r\npassages from the report of the trial: \"Robert Sherringham testified\r\nthat the axle-tree of his cart, happening, in passing, to break some\r\npart of Rose Cullender's house, in her anger at it, she vehemently\r\nthreatened him his horses should suffer for it; and, within a short\r\ntime, all his four horses died; after which he sustained many other\r\nlosses, in the sudden dying of his cattle. He was also taken with a\r\nlameness in his limbs, and so far vexed with lice of an extraordinary\r\nnumber and bigness, that no art could hinder the swarming of them, till\r\nhe burned up two suits of apparel.\"—\"Margaret Arnold testified that Amy\r\nDunny afflicted her children: they (the children), she said, would see\r\nmice running round the house, and, when they caught them and threw them\r\ninto the fire, they would screech out like rats.\"—\"A thing like a bee\r\nflew at the face of the younger child; the child fell into a fit, and\r\nat last vomited up a two-penny nail, with a broad head, affirming that\r\nthe bee brought this nail, and forced it into her mouth.\"—\"She one day\r\ncaught an invisible mouse, and, throwing it into the fire, it flashed\r\nlike to gunpowder. None besides the child saw the mouse, but every one\r\nsaw the flash!\"\r\n\r\nIn this instance we perceive the influence of prejudice in perverting\r\nevidence. The circumstance that[i.357] the mouse was invisible to all\r\neyes but those of the child ought to have satisfied the Court and jury\r\nthat she was either under the power of a delusion or practising an\r\nimposture. But, as they were predisposed to find something supernatural\r\nin the transaction, their minds seized upon the pretended invisibility\r\nof the mouse as conclusive proof of diabolical agency.\r\n\r\nMany persons who were present expressed the opinion, that the issue of\r\nthe trial would have been favorable to the prisoners, had it not been\r\nfor the following circumstance: Sir Thomas Browne, a physician,\r\nphilosopher, and scholar of unrivalled celebrity at that time, happened\r\nto be upon the spot; and it was the universal wish that he should be\r\ncalled to the stand, and his opinion be obtained on the general subject\r\nof witchcraft. An enthusiastic contemporary admirer of Sir Thomas\r\nBrowne thus describes him: \"The horizon of his understanding was much\r\nlarger than the hemisphere of the world: all that was visible in the\r\nheavens he comprehended so well, that few that are under them knew so\r\nmuch; and of the earth he had such a minute and exact geographical\r\nknowledge as if he had been by Divine Providence ordained\r\nsurveyor-general of the whole terrestrial globe and its products,\r\nminerals, plants, and animals.\" His memory is stated to have been\r\ninferior only to that of Seneca or Scaliger; and he was reputed master\r\nof seven languages. Dr. Johnson, who has written his biography, sums up\r\nhis character in the following terms: \"But it is not on the praises of\r\nothers, but on his[i.358] own writings, that he is to depend for the\r\nesteem of posterity, of which he will not easily be deprived, while\r\nlearning shall have any reverence among men: for there is no science in\r\nwhich he does not discover some skill; and scarce any kind of\r\nknowledge, profane or sacred, abstruse or elegant, which he does not\r\nappear to have cultivated with success.\"\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Browne was considered by those of his own generation to have\r\nmade great advances beyond the wisdom of his age. He claimed the\r\ncharacter of a reformer, and gave to his principal publication the\r\ntitle of an \"Enquiry into Vulgar Errors.\" So bold and free were his\r\nspeculations, that he was looked upon invidiously by many as a daring\r\ninnovator, and did not escape the denunciatory imputation of heresy.\r\nNothing could be more unjust, however, than this latter charge. He was\r\na most ardent and zealous believer in the doctrines of the Established\r\nChurch. He declares \"that he assumes the honorable style of a\r\nChristian,\" not because \"it is the religion of his country,\" but\r\nbecause, \"having in his riper years and confirmed judgment seen and\r\nexamined all, he finds himself obliged, by the principles of grace and\r\nthe law of his own reason, to embrace no other name but this.\" He\r\nexults and \"blesses himself, that he lived not in the days of miracles,\r\nwhen faith had been thrust upon him, but enjoys that greater blessing\r\npronounced to all that believed, and saw not:\" nay, he goes so far as\r\nto say, that they only had the advantage \"of a bold and noble faith,\r\nwho lived before the[i.359] coming of the Saviour, and, upon obscure\r\nprophecies and mystical types, could raise a belief.\" The fact that\r\nsuch a man was accused of infidelity is an affecting proof of the\r\ninjustice that is sometimes done by the judgment of contemporaries.\r\n\r\nThis prodigy of learning and philosophy went into Court, took the\r\nstand, and declared his opinion in favor of the reality of witchcraft,\r\nentered into a particular discussion of the subject before the jury,\r\nthrew the whole weight of his great name into the wavering scales of\r\njustice, and the poor women were convicted. The authority of Sir Thomas\r\nBrowne, added to the other evidence, perplexed Sir Matthew Hale. A\r\nreporter of the trial says, \"that it made this great and good man\r\ndoubtful; but he was in such fears, and proceeded with such caution,\r\nthat he would not so much as sum up the evidence, but left it to the\r\njury with prayers, 'that the great God of heaven would direct their\r\nhearts in that weighty matter.'\"\r\n\r\nThe result of this important trial established decisively the\r\ninterpretation of English law; and the printed report of it was used as\r\nan authoritative text-book in the Court at Salem.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Robert Boyle flourished in the latter half of the\r\nseventeenth century. He is allowed by all to have done much towards the\r\nintroduction of an improved philosophy, and the promotion of\r\nexperimental science. But he could not entirely shake off the\r\nsuperstition of his age.\r\n\r\nA small city in Burgundy, called Mascon, was[i.360] famous in the\r\nannals of witchcraft. In a work called \"The Theatre of God's\r\nJudgments,\" published, in London, by Thomas Beard in 1612, there is the\r\nfollowing passage: \"It was a very lamentable spectacle that chanced to\r\nthe Governor of Mascon, a magician, whom the Devil snatched up in\r\ndinner-while, and hoisted aloft, carrying him three times about the\r\ntown of Mascon, in the presence of many beholders, to whom he cried in\r\nthis manner, 'Help, help, my friends!' so that the whole town stood\r\namazed thereat; yea, and the remembrance of this strange accident\r\nsticketh at this day fast in the minds of all the inhabitants of this\r\ncountry.\" A malicious and bigoted monk, who discharged the office of\r\nchief legend-maker to the Benedictine Abbey, in the vicinity of Mascon,\r\nfabricated this ridiculous story for the purpose of bringing the\r\nGovernor into disrepute. An account of another diabolical visitation,\r\nsuggested, it is probable, by the one just described, was issued from\r\nthe press, under the title of \"The Devil of Mascon,\" during the\r\nlifetime of Boyle, who gave his sanction to the work, promoted its\r\nversion into English, and, as late as 1678, publicly declared his\r\nbelief of the supernatural transaction it related.\r\n\r\nThe subject of demonology, in all its forms and phases, embracing\r\nwitchcraft, held a more commanding place throughout Europe, in the\r\nliterature of the centuries immediately preceding the eighteenth, than\r\nany other. Works of the highest pretension, elaborate, learned,\r\nvoluminous, and exhausting, were published,[i.361] by the authority of\r\ngovernments and universities, to expound it. It was regarded as\r\noccupying the most eminent department of jurisprudence, as well as of\r\nscience and theology.\r\n\r\nRaphael De La Torre and Adam Tanner published treatises establishing\r\nthe right and duty of ecclesiastical tribunals to punish all who\r\npractised or dealt with the arts of demonology. In 1484, Sprenger came\r\nout with his famous book, \"Malleus Maleficarum;\" or, the \"Hammer of\r\nWitches.\" Paul Layman, in 1629, issued an elaborate work on \"Judicial\r\nProcesses against Sorcerers and Witches.\" The following is the title of\r\na bulky volume of some seven hundred pages: \"Demonology, or Natural\r\nMagic or demoniacal, lawful and unlawful, also open or secret, by the\r\nintervention and invocation of a Demon,\" published in 1612. It consists\r\nof four books, treating of the crime of witchcraft, and its punishment\r\nin the ordinary tribunals and the Inquisitorial office. Its author was\r\nDon Francisco Torreblanca Villalpando, of Cordova, Advocate Royal in\r\nthe courts of Grenada. It was republished in 1623, by command of Philip\r\nIII. of Spain, on the recommendation of the Fiscal General, and with\r\nthe sanction of the Royal Council and the Holy Inquisition. This work\r\nmay be considered as establishing and defining the doctrines, in\r\nreference to witchcraft, prevailing in all Catholic countries. It was\r\nindorsed by royal, judicial, academical, and ecclesiastical approval;\r\nis replete with extraordinary erudition, arranged in the most\r\nscientific form, em[i.362]bracing in a methodical classification all\r\nthe minutest details of the subject, and codifying it into a complete\r\nsystem of law. There was no particular in all the proceedings and all\r\nthe doctrines brought out at the trials in Salem, which did not find\r\nample justification and support in this work of Catholic, imperial, and\r\nEuropean authority.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the writer of the greatest influence on this subject in\r\nEngland and America, during the whole of the seventeenth century, was\r\nWilliam Perkins, \"the learned, pious, and painful preacher of God's\r\nWord, at St. Andrew's, in Cambridge,\" where he died, in 1602, aged\r\nforty-four years. He was quite a voluminous author; and many of his\r\nworks were translated into French, Dutch, Italian, and Spanish. Fuller,\r\nin \"The Holy State,\" selects him as the impersonation of the qualities\r\nrequisite to \"the Faithful Minister.\" In his glowing eulogium upon his\r\nlearning and talents, he says:—\r\n\r\n\"He would pronounce the word _damne_ with such an emphasis as left a\r\ndoleful echo in his auditors' ears a good while after. And, when\r\ncatechist of Christ's College, in expounding the Commandments, applied\r\nthem so home,—able almost to make his hearers' hearts fall down, and\r\nhairs to stand upright. But, in his older age, he altered his voice,\r\nand remitted much of his former rigidness, often professing that to\r\npreach mercy was that proper office of the ministers of the\r\ngospel.\"—\"Our Perkins brought the schools into the pulpit, and,\r\nunshelling their controversies out of their hard school-terms, made\r\nthereof plain and wholesome meat for his peo[i.363]ple; for he had a\r\ncapacious head, with angles winding, and roomy enough to lodge all\r\ncontroversial intricacies.\"—\"He had a rare felicity in speedy reading\r\nof books; so that, as it were, riding post through an author, he took\r\nstrict notice of all passages. Perusing books so speedily, one would\r\nthink he read nothing; so accurately, one would think he read all.\"\r\n\r\nAn octavo volume, written by this great scholar and divine, was\r\npublished at Cambridge in England, under the title, \"Discourse of the\r\nDamned Art of Witchcraft.\" It went through several editions, and had a\r\nwide and permanent circulation.\r\n\r\nThis work, the character of which is sufficiently indicated in its\r\nemphatic title, was the great authority on the subject with our\r\nfathers; and Mr. Parris had a copy of it in his possession when the\r\nproceedings in reference to witchcraft began at Salem Village.\r\n\r\nJohn Gaule published an octavo volume in London, in 1646, entitled,\r\n\"Select Cases of Conscience concerning Witches and Witchcraft.\" He is\r\none of the most exact writers on the subject, and arranges witches in\r\nthe following classes: \"1. The diviner, gypsy, or fortune-telling\r\nwitch; 2. The astrologian, star-gazing, planetary, prognosticating\r\nwitch; 3. The chanting, canting, or calculating witch, who works by\r\nsigns and numbers; 4. The venefical, or poisoning witch; 5. The\r\nexorcist, or conjuring witch; 6. The gastronomic witch; 7. The magical,\r\nspeculative, sciential, or arted witch; 8. The necromancer.\"\r\n\r\nBesides innumerable writers of this class, who spread out the\r\nscholastic learning on the subject,[i.364] and presented it in a\r\nlogical and theological form, there were others who treated it in a\r\nmore popular style, and invested it with the charms of elegant\r\nliterature. Henry Hallywell published an octavo in London, in 1681, in\r\nwhich, while the main doctrines of witchcraft as then almost\r\nuniversally received are enforced, an attempt was made to divest it of\r\nsome of its most repulsive and terrible features. He gives the\r\nfollowing account of the means by which a person may place himself\r\nbeyond the reach of the power of witchcraft:—\r\n\r\n\"It is possible for the soul to arise to such a height, and become so\r\ndivine, that no witchcraft or evil demons can have any power upon the\r\nbody. When the bodily life is too far invigorated and awakened, and\r\ndraws the intellect, the flower and summity of the soul, into a\r\nconspiration with it, then are we subject and obnoxious to magical\r\nassaults. For magic or sorcery, being founded only in this lower or\r\nmundane spirit, he that makes it his business to be freed and released\r\nfrom all its blandishments and flattering devocations, and endeavors\r\nwholly to withdraw himself from the love of corporeity and too near a\r\nsympathy with the frail flesh, he, by it, enkindles such a divine\r\nprinciple as lifts him above the fate of this inferior world, and\r\nadorns his mind with such an awful majesty that beats back all\r\nenchantments, and makes the infernal fiends tremble at his presence,\r\nhating those vigorous beams of light which are so contrary and\r\nrepugnant to their dark natures.\"\r\n\r\nThe mind of this beautiful writer found encouragement and security in\r\nthe midst of the diabolical spir[i.365]its, with whom he believed the\r\nworld to be infested, in the following views and speculations:—\r\n\r\n\"For there is a chain of government that runs down from God, the\r\nSupreme Monarch, whose bright and piercing eyes look through all that\r\nhe has made, to the lowest degree of the creation; and there are\r\npresidential angels of empires and kingdoms, and such as under them\r\nhave the tutelage of private families; and, lastly, every man's\r\nparticular guardian genius. Nor is the inanimate or material world left\r\nto blind chance or fortune; but there are, likewise, mighty and potent\r\nspirits, to whom is committed the guidance and care of the fluctuating\r\nand uncertain motions of it, and by their ministry, fire and vapor,\r\nstorms and tempests, snow and hail, heat and cold, are all kept within\r\nsuch bounds and limits as are most serviceable to the ends of\r\nProvidence. They take care of the variety of seasons, and superintend\r\nthe tillage and fruits of the earth; upon which account, Origen calls\r\nthem _invisible_ husbandmen. So that, all affairs and things being\r\nunder the inspection and government of these incorporeal beings, the\r\npower of the dark kingdom and its agents is under a strict confinement\r\nand restraint; and they cannot bring a general mischief upon the world\r\nwithout a special permission of a superior Providence.\"\r\n\r\nSpenser has the same imagery and sentiment:—\r\n\r\n\"How oft do they their silver bowers leave,\r\nTo come to succor us, that succor want?\r\nHow oft do they with golden pinions cleave\r\nThe flitting skies, like flying pursuivant,\r\nAgainst foul fiends to aid us militant?\r\nThey for us fight, they watch and duly ward,\r\nAnd their bright squadrons round about us plant,\r\nAnd all for love and nothing for reward:\r\nOh! why should heavenly God to man have such regard?\"\r\n[i.366]\r\n\r\nWhile there can be no doubt that the superstitious opinions we have\r\nbeen reviewing were diffused generally among the great body of the\r\npeople of all ranks and conditions, it would be unjust to truth not to\r\nmention that there were some persons who looked upon them as empty\r\nfables and vain imaginations. Error has never yet made a complete and\r\nuniversal conquest. In the darkest ages and most benighted regions, it\r\nhas been found impossible utterly to extinguish the light of reason.\r\nThere always have been some in whose souls the torch of truth has been\r\nkept burning with vestal watchfulness: we can discern its glimmer here\r\nand there through the deepest night that has yet settled upon the\r\nearth. In the midst of the most extravagant superstition, there have\r\nbeen individuals who have disowned the popular belief, and considered\r\nit a mark of wisdom and true philosophy to discard the idle fancies and\r\nabsurd schemes of faith that possessed the minds of the great mass of\r\ntheir contemporaries. This was the case with Horace, as appears from\r\nlines thus quite freely but effectively translated:—\r\n\r\n\"These dreams and terrors magical,\r\nThese miracles and witches,\r\nNight-walking spirites or Thessal bugs,\r\nEsteeme them not two rushes.\"\r\n\r\nThe intellect of Seneca also rose above the reach of the popular\r\ncredulity with respect to the agency of supernatural beings and the\r\nefficacy of mysterious charms.\r\n\r\nIf we could but obtain access to the secret thoughts[i.367] of the\r\nwisest philosophers and of the men of genius of antiquity, we should\r\nprobably find that many of them were superior to the superstitions of\r\ntheir times. Even in the thick darkness of the dark ages, there were\r\nminds too powerful to be kept in chains by error and delusion.\r\n\r\nHenry Cornelius Agrippa, who was born in the latter part of the\r\nfifteenth century, was, perhaps, the greatest philosopher and scholar\r\nof his period. In early life, he was very much devoted to the science\r\nof magic, and was a strenuous supporter of demonology and witchcraft.\r\nIn the course of his studies and meditations, he was led to a change of\r\nviews on these subjects, and did all that he could to warn others from\r\nputting confidence in such vain, frivolous, and absurd superstitions as\r\nthen possessed the world. The consequence was, that he was denounced\r\nand prosecuted as a conjurer, and charged with having written against\r\nmagic and witchcraft, in order the more securely to shelter himself\r\nfrom the suspicion of practising them. As an instance of the calumnies\r\nthat were heaped upon him, I would mention that Paulus Jovius asserted\r\nthat \"Cornelius Agrippa went always accompanied with an evil spirit in\r\nthe similitude of a black dog;\" and that, when the time of his death\r\ndrew near, \"he took off the enchanted collar from the dog's neck, and\r\nsent him away with these terms, 'Get thee hence, thou cursed beast,\r\nwhich hast utterly destroyed me:' neither was the dog ever seen after.\"\r\nButler, in his \"Hudibras,\" has not neg[i.368]lected to celebrate this\r\nremarkable connection between Satan and the man of learning:—\r\n\r\n\"Agrippa kept a Stygian pug\r\nI' th' garb and habit of a dog,\r\nThat was his tutor; and the cur\r\nRead to th' occult philosopher.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Wierus wrote an elaborate, learned, and judicious book, in which\r\nhe treated at large of magic, sorcery, and witchcraft, and did all that\r\nscholarship, talent, and philosophy could do to undermine and subvert\r\nthe whole system of the prevailing popular superstition. But he fared\r\nno better than his predecessor, patron, and master, Agrippa; for, like\r\nhim, he was accused of having attempted to persuade the world that\r\nthere was no reality in supernatural charms and diabolical\r\nconfederacies, in order that he might devote himself to them without\r\nsuspicion or molestation, and was borne down by the bigotry and\r\nfanaticism of his times.\r\n\r\nKing James merely gave utterance to the general sentiment, and\r\npronounced the verdict of popular opinion, in the following extract\r\nfrom the preface to his \"Demonologie:\" \"Wierus, a German physician,\r\nsets out a public apologie for all these crafts-folkes, whereby,\r\nprocuring for them impunitie, he plainly bewrays himself to have been\r\nof that profession.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1584, a quarto volume was published in London, the work of Reginald\r\nScott, a learned English gentleman, whose title sufficiently indicates\r\nits import, \"The Discovery of Witchcraft, wherein the lewde dealing\r\nof[i.369] witches and witchmongers is notably detected; the knavery of\r\nconjurers, the impiety of inchanters, the folly of soothsayers, the\r\nimpudent falsehood of cozeners, the infidelity of atheists, the\r\npestilent practices of pythonists, the curiosities of figure-casters,\r\nthe vanity of dreamers, the beggarly art of alcumstrie, the abomination\r\nof idolatrie, the horrible art of poisoning, the virtue and power of\r\nnatural magic, and all the conveniencies of legerdemaine and juggling,\r\nare discovered, &c.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1599, Samuel Harsnett, Archbishop of York, wrote a work, published\r\nin London, to expose certain persons who pretended to have the power of\r\ncasting out devils, and detecting their \"deceitful trade.\" This writer\r\nwas among the first to bring the power of bold satire and open\r\ndenunciation to bear against the superstitions of demonology. He thus\r\ndescribes the motives and the methods of such impostors:—\r\n\r\n\"Out of these,\" saith he, \"is shaped us the true idea of a witch,—an\r\nold, weather-beaten crone, having her chin and her knees meeting for\r\nage, walking like a bow, leaning on a staff; hollow-eyed, untoothed,\r\nfurrowed on her face, having her limbs trembling with the palsy, going\r\nmumbling in the streets; one that hath forgotten her Pater-noster, and\r\nyet hath a shrewd tongue to call a drab a drab. If she hath learned of\r\nan old wife, in a chimney-end, Pax, Max, Fax, for a spell, or can say\r\nSir John Grantham's curse for the miller's eels, 'All ye that have\r\nstolen the miller's eels, Laudate dominum de coelis: and all they that\r\nhave consented thereto, Benedicamus domino:' why then, beware! look\r\nabout[i.370] you, my neighbors. If any of you have a sheep sick of the\r\ngiddies, or a hog of the mumps, or a horse of the staggers, or a\r\nknavish boy of the school, or an idle girl of the wheel, or a young\r\ndrab of the sullens, and hath not fat enough for her porridge, or\r\nbutter enough for her bread, and she hath a little help of the epilepsy\r\nor cramp, to teach her to roll her eyes, wry her mouth, gnash her\r\nteeth, startle with her body, hold her arms and hands stiff, &c.; and\r\nthen, when an old Mother Nobs hath by chance called her an idle young\r\nhousewife, or bid the Devil scratch her, then no doubt but Mother Nobs\r\nis the witch, and the young girl is owl blasted, &c. They that have\r\ntheir brains baited and their fancies distempered with the imaginations\r\nand apprehensions of witches, conjurers, and fairies, and all that\r\nlymphatic chimera, I find to be marshalled in one of these five ranks:\r\nchildren, fools, women, cowards, sick or black melancholic discomposed\r\nwits.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1669, a work was published in London with the following title: \"The\r\nQuestion of Witchcraft Debated; or, a Discourse against their Opinions\r\nthat affirm Witches.\" It is a work of great merit, and would do honor\r\nto a scholar and logician of the present day. The author was John\r\nWagstaffe, of Oxford University: he is described as a crooked,\r\nshrivelled, little man, of a most despicable appearance. This\r\ncircumstance, together with his writings against the popular belief in\r\nwitchcraft, led his academical associates to accuse him, some of them\r\nin sport, but others with grave suspicion, of being a wizard. Wood, the\r\nhistorian of Oxford, says that \"he died in a manner distracted,\r\noccasioned by a deep conceit of his own parts, and by a\r\ncontinual[i.371] bibbing of strong and high-tasted liquors.\" But poor\r\nWagstaffe was assailed by something more than private raillery and\r\nslander. His heretical sentiments exposed him to the battery of the\r\nhost of writers who will always be found ready to advocate a prevailing\r\nopinion. But Wagstaffe was not left entirely alone to defend the cause\r\nof reason and truth. He had one most zealous advocate and ardent\r\nadmirer in the author of a work on \"The Doctrine of Devils,\" published\r\nin 1676. This writer sums up a panegyric upon Wagstaffe's performance,\r\nby pronouncing it \"a judicious book, that contains more good reason,\r\ntrue religion, and right Christianity, than all those lumps and\r\ncartloads of luggage that hath been fardled up by all the faggeters of\r\ndemonologistical winter-tales, and witchcraftical legendaries, since\r\nthey first began to foul clean paper.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Balthasar Bekker, of Amsterdam, who was equally eminent in\r\nastronomy, philosophy, and theology, published in 1691 a learned and\r\npowerful work, called \"The World Bewitched,\" in which he openly\r\nassailed the doctrines of witchcraft and of the Devil, and anticipated\r\nmany of the views and arguments presented in Farmer's excellent\r\npublications. As a reward for his exertions to enlighten his\r\nfellow-creatures, he was turned out of the ministry, and assaulted by\r\nnearly all the writers of his age.\r\n\r\nDr. Bekker was one of the ablest and boldest writers of his day, and\r\ndid much to advance the cause of natural science, scriptural\r\ninterpretation, and the princi[i.372]ples of enlightened Christianity.\r\nIn 1680 he published an \"Inquiry concerning Comets,\" rescuing them from\r\nthe realm of superstition, placing them within the natural physical\r\nlaws, and exploding the then-received opinion, that, in any way, they\r\nare the presages or forerunners of evil. His \"Exposition on the Prophet\r\nDaniel\" gives proof of his learning and judgment. His great merits were\r\nrecognized by John Locke and Richard Bentley. In the preface to his\r\n\"World Bewitched,\" he says, that it grieved him to see the great\r\nhonors, powers, and miracles which are ascribed to the Devil. \"It has\r\ncome to that pass,\" to use his own language, \"that men think it piety\r\nand godliness to ascribe a great many wonders to the Devil, and impiety\r\nand heresy, if a man will not believe that the Devil can do what a\r\nthousand persons say he does. It is now reckoned godliness, if a man\r\nwho fears God fear also the Devil. If he be not afraid of the Devil, he\r\npasses for an atheist, who does not believe in God, because he cannot\r\nthink that there are two gods, the one good, the other bad. But these,\r\nI think, with much more reason, may be called ditheists. For my part,\r\nif, on account of my opinion, they will give me a new name, let them\r\ncall me a monotheist, a believer of but one God.\" The work struck down\r\nthe whole system of demonology and witchcraft, by proving that there\r\nnever was really such a thing as sorcery or possession, and that devils\r\nhave no influence over human affairs or the persons of men. It is not\r\nsurprising that it raised a great clamor. The wonder is that it did not\r\ncost him[i.373] his life. It is probable that his protection was the\r\nconfidence the people had in his character and learning. Attempts were\r\nmade to diminish that confidence, and bring him into odium, by\r\nlevelling against him every form of abuse. A medal was struck, and\r\nextensively circulated, representing the Devil, clothed like a minister\r\nor priest, riding on an ass. The device was so arranged as to excite\r\nridicule and abhorrence, in the vulgar mind, against Bekker. But it was\r\nfound impossible to turn the popular feeling, which had set in his\r\nfavor; and his persecutors and defamers were completely baffled. He was\r\nfollowed, soon after, by the learned Thomasius, whose writings against\r\ndemonology produced a decided effect upon the convictions of the age.\r\n\r\nWhile Bekker, and the other writers of his class, endeavored to\r\noverthrow the superstitious practices and fancies then prevalent\r\nrespecting demonology and communications with spiritual beings, they so\r\nfar acceded to the popular theology as to maintain the doctrine of the\r\npersonality of the Devil. They believed in the existence of the\r\narch-fiend, but denied his agency in human affairs. They held that he\r\nwas kept confined \"to bottomless perdition, there to dwell—\r\n\r\n\"In adamantine chains and penal fire.\"\r\n\r\nSir Robert Filmer, in 1680, published \"An Advertisement to the jurymen\r\nof England, touching Witches,\" in which he criticised and condemned\r\nmany of the opinions and methods then countenanced on the\r\nsubject.[i.374]\r\n\r\nBut Bekker, Thomasius, and Filmer appeared too late to operate upon the\r\nprevalent opinions of Europe or America prior to the witchcraft\r\ndelusion of 1692. The productions of the other writers, in the same\r\ndirection, to whom I have referred, probably had a very limited\r\ncirculation, and made at the time but little impression. Error is\r\nseldom overthrown by mere reasoning. It yields only to the logic of\r\nevents. No power of learning or wit could have rooted the witchcraft\r\nsuperstitions out of the minds of men. Nothing short of a demonstration\r\nof their deformities, follies, and horrors, such as here was held up to\r\nthe view of the world, could have given their death-blow. This was the\r\nfinal cause of Salem Witchcraft, and makes it one of the great\r\nlandmarks in the world's history.\r\n\r\nA full and just view of the position and obligations of the persons who\r\ntook part in the transactions at Salem requires a previous knowledge of\r\nthe principles and the state of the law, as it was then in force and\r\nunderstood by the courts, and all concerned in judicial proceedings.\r\nAlthough the ancients did not regard pretended intercourse between\r\nmagicians and enchanters and spiritual beings as necessarily or always\r\ncriminal, we find that they enacted laws against the abuse of the power\r\nsupposed to result from the connection. The old Roman code of the\r\nTwelve Tables contained the following prohibition: \"That they should\r\nnot bewitch the fruits of the earth, nor use any charms, to draw their\r\nneighbor's corn into their own fields.\" There were several special\r\nedicts on the subject during[i.375] the existence of the Roman State.\r\nIn the early Christian councils, sorcery was frequently made the object\r\nof denunciation. At Laodicea, for instance, in the year 364, it was\r\nvoted to excommunicate any clergymen who were magicians, enchanters,\r\nastrologers, or mathematicians! The Bull of Pope Innocent VIII., near\r\nthe close of the fifteenth century, has already been mentioned.\r\n\r\nDr. Turner, in his history of the Anglo-Saxons, says that they had laws\r\nagainst sorcerers and witches, but that they did not punish them with\r\ndeath. There was an English statute against witchcraft, in the reign of\r\nHenry VIII., and another in that of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, however, the legislation of parliament on the subject\r\nwas merciful and judicious: for it did not attach to the guilt of\r\nwitchcraft the punishment of death, unless it had been used to destroy\r\nlife; that is, unless it had become murder.\r\n\r\nOn the demise of Elizabeth, James of Scotland ascended the throne. His\r\npedantic and eccentric character is well known. He had an early and\r\ndecided inclination towards abstruse or mysterious speculations. Before\r\nhe had reached his twentieth year, he undertook to accomplish what only\r\nthe most sanguine and profound theologians have ever dared to attempt:\r\nhe expounded the Book of Revelation. When he was about twenty-five\r\nyears of age, he published a work on the \"Doctrine of Devils and\r\nWitchcraft.\" Not long after, he succeeded to the British crown. It may\r\neasily be imagined that the subject of demonology[i.376] soon became a\r\nfashionable and prevailing topic of conversation in the royal saloons\r\nand throughout the nation. It served as a medium through which\r\nobsequious courtiers could convey their flattery to the ears of their\r\naccomplished and learned sovereign. His Majesty's book was reprinted\r\nand extensively circulated. It was of course praised and recommended in\r\nall quarters.\r\n\r\nThe parliament, actuated by a base desire to compliment the vain and\r\nsuperstitious king, enacted a new and much more severe statute against\r\nwitchcraft, in the very first year of his reign. It was under this law\r\nthat so many persons here and in England were deprived of their lives.\r\nThe blood of hundreds of innocent persons was thus unrighteously shed.\r\nIt was a fearful price which these servile lawgivers paid for the favor\r\nof their prince.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the only mischief brought about by courtly deference\r\nto the prejudices of King James. It was under his direction that our\r\npresent translation of the Scriptures was made. To please His Royal\r\nMajesty, and to strengthen the arguments in his work on demonology, the\r\nword \"witch\" was used to represent expressions in the original Hebrew,\r\nthat conveyed an entirely different idea; and it was freely inserted in\r\nthe headings of the chapters.[B] A person having \"a familiar spirit\"\r\nwas a favorite description of a witch in the king's book. The\r\ntrans[i.377]lators, forgetful of their high and solemn function,\r\nendeavored to establish this definition by inserting it into their\r\nversion. Accordingly, they introduced it in several places; in the\r\neleventh verse of the eighteenth chapter of Deuteronomy, for instance,\r\n\"a consulter with familiar spirits.\" There is no word in the Hebrew\r\nwhich corresponds with \"familiar.\" And this is the important, the\r\nessential word in the definition. It conveys the idea of alliance,\r\nstated connection, confederacy, or compact, which is characteristic and\r\ndistinctive of a witch. The expression in the original signifies \"a\r\nconsulter with spirits,\"—especially, as was the case with the \"Witch of\r\nEndor,\" a consulter with departed spirits. It was a shocking perversion\r\nof the word of God, for the purpose of flattering a frail and mortal\r\nsovereign! King James lived to see and acknowledge the error of his\r\nearly opinions, and he would gladly have counteracted their bad effect;\r\nbut it is easier to make laws and translations than it is to alter and\r\namend them.\r\n\r\nWhile the law of the land required the capital punishment of witches,\r\nno blame ought to be attached to judges and jurors for discharging\r\ntheir respective duties in carrying it into execution. It will not do\r\nfor us to assert, that they ought to have refused, let the consequences\r\nto themselves have been what they would, to sanction and give effect to\r\nsuch inhuman and unreasonable enactments. We cannot consistently take\r\nthis ground; for there is nothing more certain than that, with their\r\nnotions, our ancestors had at least as[i.378] good reasons to advance\r\nin favor of punishing witchcraft with death, as we have for punishing\r\nany crime whatsoever in the same awful and summary manner. We appeal,\r\nin defence of our capital punishments, to the text of Moses, \"Whoso\r\nsheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed.\" The apologist of\r\nour fathers, for carrying into effect the law making witchcraft a\r\ncapital offence, tells us in reply, in the first place, that this\r\npassage is not of the nature of a precept, but merely of an admonition;\r\nthat it does not enjoin any particular method of proceeding, but simply\r\ndescribes the natural consequences of cruel and contentious conduct;\r\nand that it amounts only to this: that quarrelsome, violent, and\r\nbloodthirsty persons will be apt to meet the same fate they bring upon\r\nothers; that the duellist will be likely to fall in private combat, the\r\nambitious conqueror to perish, and the warlike nation to be destroyed,\r\non the field of battle. If this is not considered by us a sufficient\r\nand satisfactory answer, he advances to our own ground, points to the\r\nsame text where we place our defence, and puts his finger on the\r\nfollowing plain and authoritative precept: \"Thou shalt not suffer a\r\nwitch to live.\" Indeed we must acknowledge, that the capital punishment\r\nof witches is as strongly supported and fortified by the Scriptures of\r\nthe Old Testament—at least, as they appear in our present version—as\r\nthe capital punishment of any crime whatever.\r\n\r\nIf we adopt another line of argument, and say that it is necessary to\r\npunish some particular crimes with[i.379] death, in order to maintain\r\nthe security of society, or hold up an impressive warning to others,\r\nhere also we find that our opponent has full as much to offer in\r\ndefence of our fathers as can be offered in our own defence. He\r\ndescribes to us the tremendous and infernal power which was universally\r\nbelieved by them to be possessed by a witch; a power which, as it was\r\nnot derived from a natural source, could not easily be held in check by\r\nnatural restraints: neither chains nor dungeons could bind it down or\r\nconfine it. You might load the witch with irons, you might bury her in\r\nthe lowest cell of a feudal prison, and still it was believed that she\r\ncould send forth her imps or her spectre to ravage the fields, and\r\nblight the meadows, and throw the elements into confusion, and torture\r\nthe bodies, and craze the minds, of any who might be the objects of her\r\nmalice.\r\n\r\nShakspeare, in the description which he puts into the mouth of Macbeth\r\nof the supernatural energy of witchcraft, does not surpass, if he does\r\njustice to, the prevailing belief on the subject:—\r\n\r\n\"I conjure you, by that which you profess,\r\n(Howe'er you came to know it) answer me,—\r\nThough you untie the winds, and let them fight\r\nAgainst the churches; though the yesty waves\r\nConfound and swallow navigation up;\r\nThough bladed corn be lodged, and trees blown down;\r\nThough castles topple on their warders' heads;\r\nThough palaces and pyramids do slope\r\nTheir heads to their foundations; though the treasure\r\nOf nature's germins tumble all together,\r\nEven till destruction sicken,—answer me\r\nTo what I ask you.\"\r\n[i.380]\r\n\r\nThere was indeed an almost infinite power to do mischief associated\r\nwith a disposition to do it. No human strength could strip the witch of\r\nthese mighty energies while she lived; nothing but death could destroy\r\nthem. There was, as our ancestors considered, incontestable evidence,\r\nthat she had put them forth to the injury, loss, and perhaps death, of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nCan it be wondered at, that, under such circumstances, the law\r\nconnecting capital punishment with the guilt of witchcraft was resorted\r\nto as the only means to protect society, and warn others from entering\r\ninto the dark, wicked, and malignant compact?\r\n\r\nIt is not probable that even King James's Parliament would have been\r\nwilling to go to the length of Selden in his \"Table-Talk,\" who takes\r\nthis ground in defence of the capital punishment of witches. \"The law\r\nagainst witches does not prove there be any, but it punishes the malice\r\nof those people that use such means to take away men's lives. If one\r\nshould profess, that, by turning his hat thrice and crying 'Buzz,' he\r\ncould take away a man's life (though in truth he could do no such\r\nthing), yet this were a just law made by the State, that whoever should\r\nturn his hat thrice and cry 'Buzz,' with an intention to take away a\r\nman's life, shall be put to death.\"\r\n\r\nThere are other considerations that deserve to be weighed before a\r\nfinal judgment should be made up respecting the conduct of our fathers\r\nin the witchcraft delusion. Among these is the condition of physical\r\nscience in their day. But little knowledge of the[i.381] laws of nature\r\nwas possessed, and that little was confined to a few. The world was\r\nstill, to the mass of the people, almost as full of mystery in its\r\nphysical departments as it was to its first inhabitants. Politics,\r\npoetry, rhetoric, ethics, and history had been cultivated to a great\r\nextent in previous ages; but the philosophy of the natural and material\r\nworld was almost unknown. Astronomy, chemistry, optics, pneumatics, and\r\neven geography, were involved in the general darkness and error. Some\r\nof our most important sciences, such as electricity, date their origin\r\nfrom a later period.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable tardiness in the progress of physical science for some\r\ntime after the era of the revival of learning is to be accounted for by\r\nreferring to the erroneous methods of reasoning and observation then\r\nprevalent in the world. A false logic was adopted in the schools of\r\nlearning and philosophy. The great instrument for the discovery and\r\ninvestigation of truth was the syllogism, the most absurd contrivance\r\nof the human mind; an argumentative process whose conclusion is\r\ncontained in the premises; a method of proof, in the first step of\r\nwhich the matter to be proved is taken for granted.[C] In a word, the\r\nwhole system of philosophy was made up of hypotheses, and[i.382] the\r\nonly foundation of science was laid in conjecture. The imagination,\r\ncalled necessarily into extraordinary action, in the absence of\r\nscientific certainty, was still further exercised in vain attempts to\r\ndiscover, unassisted by observation and experiment, the elements and\r\nfirst principles of nature. It had reached a monstrous growth about the\r\ntime to which we are referring. Indeed it may be said, that all the\r\nintellectual productions of modern times, from the seventeenth century\r\nback to the dark ages, were works of imagination. The bulkiest and most\r\nvoluminous writings that proceeded from the cloisters or the\r\nuniversities, even the metaphysical disquisitions of the Nominalists\r\nand Realists, and the boundless subtleties of the contending schools of\r\nthe \"Divine Doctors,\" Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus, fall under this\r\ndescription. Dull, dreary, unintelligible, and interminable as they\r\nare, they are still in reality works of fancy. They are the offspring,\r\nalmost exclusively, of the imaginative faculty. It ought not to create\r\nsurprise, to find that this faculty predominated in the minds and\r\ncharacters of our ancestors, and developed itself to an extent beyond\r\nour conception, when we reflect that it was almost the only one called\r\ninto exercise, and that it was the leading element of every branch of\r\nliterature and philosophy.\r\n\r\n[i.383]\r\n\r\nIt is true, that, in the earlier part of the seventeenth century, Lord\r\nBacon made his sublime discoveries in the department of physical\r\nscience. By disclosing the true method of investigation and reasoning\r\non such subjects, he may be said to have found, or rather to have\r\ninvented, the key that unlocked the hitherto unopened halls of nature.\r\nHe introduced man to the secret chambers of the universe, and placed in\r\nhis hand the thread by which he has been conducted to the magnificent\r\nresults of modern science, and will undoubtedly be led on to results\r\nstill more magnificent in times to come. But it was not for human\r\nnature to pass in a moment from darkness to light. The transition was\r\nslow and gradual: a long twilight intervened before the sun shed its\r\nclear and full radiance upon the world.\r\n\r\nThe great discoverer himself refused to admit, or was unable to\r\ndiscern, some of the truths his system had revealed. Bacon was numbered\r\namong the opponents of the Copernican or true system of astronomy to\r\nthe day of his death; so also was Sir Thomas Browne, the great\r\nphilosopher already described, and who flourished during the latter\r\nhalf of the same century. Indeed, it may be said, that, at the time of\r\nthe witchcraft delusion, the ancient empire of darkness which had\r\noppressed and crushed the world of science had hardly been shaken. The\r\ngreat and triumphant progress of modern discovery had scarcely begun.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to illustrate these views of the state of science\r\nin the world at that time by presenting[i.384] a few instances. The\r\nslightest examination of the accounts which remain of occurrences\r\ndeemed supernatural by our ancestors will satisfy any one that they\r\nwere brought about by causes entirely natural, although unknown to\r\nthem. For instance, the following circumstances are related by the Rev.\r\nJames Pierpont, pastor of a church in New Haven, in a letter to Cotton\r\nMather, and published by him in his \"Magnalia:\"[D]—\r\n\r\nIn the year 1646, a new ship, containing a valuable cargo, and having\r\nseveral distinguished persons on board as passengers, put to sea from\r\nNew Haven in the month of January, bound to England. The vessels that\r\ncame over the ensuing spring brought no tidings of her arrival in the\r\nmother-country. The pious colonists were earnest and instant in their\r\nprayers that intelligence might be received of the missing vessel. In\r\nthe month of June, 1648, \"a great thunder-storm arose out of the\r\nnorth-west; after which (the hemisphere being serene), about an hour\r\nbefore sunset, a ship of like dimensions with the aforesaid, with her\r\ncanvas and colors abroad (although[i.385] the wind was northerly),\r\nappeared in the air, coming up from the harbor's mouth, which lies\r\nsouthward from the town,—seemingly with her sails filled under a fresh\r\ngale, holding her course north, and continuing under observation,\r\nsailing against the wind for the space of half an hour.\" The\r\nphantom-ship was borne along, until, to the excited imaginations of the\r\nspectators, she seemed to have approached so near that they could throw\r\na stone into her. Her main-topmast then disappeared, then her\r\nmizzen-topmast; then her masts were entirely carried away; and,\r\nfinally, her hull fell off, and vanished from sight,—leaving a dull and\r\nsmoke-colored cloud, which soon dissolved, and the whole atmosphere\r\nbecame clear. All affirmed that the airy vision was a precise copy and\r\nimage of the missing vessel, and that it was sent to announce and\r\ndescribe her fate. They considered it the spectre of the lost ship; and\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Davenport declared in public, \"that God had condescended,\r\nfor the quieting their afflicted spirits, this extraordinary account of\r\nhis sovereign disposal of those for whom so many fervent prayers were\r\nmade continually.\"\r\n\r\nThe results of modern science enable us to explain the mysterious\r\nappearance. It is probable that some Dutch vessel, proceeding slowly,\r\nquietly, and unconsciously on her voyage from Amsterdam to the New\r\nNetherlands, happened at the time to be passing through the Sound. At\r\nthe moment the apparition was seen in the sky, she was so near, that\r\nher reflected image was painted or delineated, to the eyes of\r\nthe[i.386] observers, on the clouds, by laws of optics now generally\r\nwell known, before her actual outlines could be discerned by them on\r\nthe horizon. As the sun sunk behind the western hills, and his rays\r\nwere gradually withdrawn, the visionary ship slowly disappeared; and\r\nthe approach of night effectually concealed the vessel as she continued\r\nher course along the Sound.\r\n\r\nThe optical illusions that present themselves on the sea-shore, by\r\nwhich distant objects are raised to view, the opposite capes and\r\nislands made to loom up, lifted above the line of the apparent\r\ncircumference of the earth, and thrown into every variety of shape\r\nwhich the imagination can conceive, are among the most beautiful\r\nphenomena of nature; and they impress the mind with the idea of\r\nenchantment and mystery, more perhaps than any others: but they have\r\nreceived a complete solution from modern discovery.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed, that the optical principles which explain these\r\nphenomena have recently afforded a foundation for the science, or\r\nrather art, of nauscopy; and there are persons in some places,—in the\r\nIsle of France, as I have been told,—whose calling and profession is to\r\nascertain and predict the approach of vessels, by their reflection in\r\nthe atmosphere and on the clouds, long before they are visible to the\r\neye, or through the glass.\r\n\r\nThe following opinion prevailed at the time of our narrative. The\r\ndiscoveries in electricity, itself a recent science, have rendered it\r\nimpossible for us to contemplate it without ridicule. But it was the\r\nsober[i.387] opinion of the age. \"A great man has noted it,\" says a\r\nlearned writer, \"that thunders break oftener on churches than any other\r\nhouses, because demons have a peculiar spite at houses that are set\r\napart for the peculiar service of God.\"\r\n\r\nEvery thing that was strange or remarkable—every thing at all out of\r\nthe usual course, every thing that was not clear and plain—was\r\nattributed to supernatural interposition. Indeed, our fathers lived, as\r\nthey thought, continually in the midst of miracles; and felt themselves\r\nsurrounded, at all times, in all scenes, with innumerable invisible\r\nbeings. The beautiful verse of Milton describes their faith:—\r\n\r\n\"Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth\r\nUnseen, both when we wake and when we sleep.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was to him, however, a momentary vision of the imagination, was to\r\nthem like a perpetual perception of the senses: it was a practical\r\nbelief, an everyday common sentiment, an all-pervading feeling. But\r\nthese supernatural beings very frequently were believed to have become\r\nvisible to our superstitious ancestors. The instances, indeed, were not\r\nrare, of individuals having seen the Devil himself with their mortal\r\neyes. They may well be brought to notice, as illustrating the ideas\r\nwhich then prevailed, and had an immediate, practical effect on the\r\nconduct of men, in reference to the power, presence, and action of the\r\nDevil in human affairs. This, in fact, is necessary, that we may\r\nunderstand the narrative we are preparing to contemplate of\r\ntransactions based wholly on those ideas.[i.388]\r\n\r\nThe following passage is extracted from a letter written to Increase\r\nMather by the Rev. John Higginson:—\r\n\r\n\"The godly Mr. Sharp, who was ruling elder of the church of Salem\r\nalmost thirty years after, related it of himself, that, being bred up\r\nto learning till he was eighteen years old, and then taken off, and put\r\nto be an apprentice to a draper in London, he yet notwithstanding\r\ncontinued a strong inclination and eager affection to books, with a\r\ncuriosity of hearkening after and reading of the strangest and oddest\r\nbooks he could get, spending much of his time that way to the neglect\r\nof his business. At one time, there came a man into the shop, and\r\nbrought a book with him, and said to him, 'Here is a book for you, keep\r\nthis till I call for it again;' and so went away. Mr. Sharp, after his\r\nwonted bookish manner, was eagerly affected to look into that book, and\r\nread it, which he did: but, as he read in it, he was seized on by a\r\nstrange kind of horror, both of body and mind, the hair of his head\r\nstanding up; and, finding these effects several times, he acquainted\r\nhis master with it, who, observing the same effects, they concluded it\r\nwas a conjuring book, and resolved to burn it, which they did. He that\r\nbrought it in the shape of a man never coming to call for it, they\r\nconcluded it was the Devil. He, taking this as a solemn warning from\r\nGod to take heed what books he read, was much taken off from his former\r\nbookishness; confining himself to reading the Bible, and other known\r\ngood books of divinity, which were profitable to his soul.\"\r\n\r\nKircher relates the following anecdote, with a full belief of its\r\ntruth: He had a friend who was zealously and perseveringly devoted to\r\nthe study of al[i.389]chemy. At one time, while he was intent upon his\r\noperations, a gentleman entered his laboratory, and kindly offered to\r\nassist him. In a few moments, a large mass of the purest gold was\r\nbrought forth from the crucible. The gentleman then took his hat, and\r\nwent out: before leaving the apartment, however, he wrote a recipe for\r\nmaking the precious article. The grateful and admiring mortal continued\r\nhis operations, according to the directions of his visitor; but the\r\ncharm was lost: he could not succeed, and was at last completely ruined\r\nby his costly and fruitless experiments. Both he and his friend Kircher\r\nwere fully persuaded that the mysterious stranger-visitor was the\r\nDevil.\r\n\r\nBaxter has recorded a curious interview between Satan and Mr. White, of\r\nDorchester, assessor to the Westminster Assembly:—\r\n\r\n\"The Devil, in a light night, stood by his bedside. The assessor looked\r\na while, whether he would say or do any thing, and then said, 'If thou\r\nhast nothing to do, I have;' and so turned himself to sleep.\" Dr.\r\nHibbert is of opinion, that the Rev. Mr. White treated his satanic\r\nmajesty, on this occasion, with \"a cool contempt, to which he had not\r\noften been accustomed.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, there is nothing more curious or instructive, in the history of\r\nthat period, than the light which it sheds upon the influence of the\r\nbelief of the personal existence and operations of the Devil, when that\r\nbelief is carried out fully into its practical effects. The Christian\r\ndoctrine had relapsed into a system almost identical with Manicheism.\r\nWierus thus describes[i.390] Satan, as he was regarded in the prevalent\r\ntheology: \"He possesses great courage, incredible cunning, superhuman\r\nwisdom, the most acute penetration, consummate prudence, an\r\nincomparable skill in veiling the most pernicious artifices under a\r\nspecious disguise, and a malicious and infinite hatred towards the\r\nhuman race, implacable and incurable.\" Milton merely responded to the\r\npopular sentiment in making Satan a character of lofty dignity, and in\r\nplacing him on an elevation not \"less than archangel ruined.\"\r\nHallywell, in his work on witchcraft, declares that \"that mighty angel\r\nof darkness is not foolishly nor idly to be scoffed at or blasphemed.\r\nThe Devil,\" says he, \"may properly be looked upon as a dignity, though\r\nhis glory be pale and wan, and those once bright and orient colors\r\nfaded and darkened in his robes; and the Scriptures represent him as a\r\nprince, though it be of devils.\" Although our fathers cannot be charged\r\nwith having regarded the Devil in this respectful and deferential\r\nlight, it must be acknowledged that they gave him a conspicuous and\r\ndistinguished—we might almost say a dignified—agency in the affairs of\r\nlife and the government of the world: they were prone to confess, if\r\nnot to revere, his presence, in all scenes and at all times. He\r\noccupied a wide space, not merely in their theology and philosophy, but\r\nin their daily and familiar thoughts.[E]\r\n\r\n[i.391]\r\n\r\nCotton Mather, in one of his sermons, carries home this peculiar belief\r\nto the consciences of his hearers, in a manner that could not have\r\nfailed to quicken and startle the most dull and drowsy among them.\r\n\r\n\"No place,\" says he, \"that I know of, has got such a spell upon it as\r\nwill always keep the Devil out. The meeting-house, wherein we assemble\r\nfor the worship of God, is filled with many holy people and many holy\r\nconcerns continually; but, if our eyes were so refined as the servant\r\nof the prophet had his of old, I suppose we should now see a throng of\r\ndevils in this very place. The apostle has intimated that angels come\r\nin among us: there are angels, it seems, that hark how I preach, and\r\nhow you hear, at this hour. And our own sad experience is enough to\r\nintimate that the devils are likewise rendezvousing here. It is\r\nreported in Job i. 5, 'When the sons of God came to present themselves\r\nbefore the Lord, Satan came also among them.' When we are in our church\r\nassemblies, oh, how many devils, do you imagine, crowd in among us!\r\nThere is a devil that rocks one to sleep. There is a devil that makes\r\nanother to be thinking of, he scarcely knows what himself. And there is\r\na devil that makes another to be pleasing himself with wanton and\r\nwicked speculations. It is also possible, that we have our closets or\r\nour studies gloriously perfumed with devotions every day; but, alas!\r\ncan we shut the Devil out of them? No: let us go where we will, we\r\nshall still find a devil nigh unto us. Only when we come to heaven, we\r\nshall be out of his reach for ever.\" [i.392]\r\n\r\nIt is very remarkable, that such a train of thought as this did not\r\nsuggest to the mind of Dr. Mather the true doctrine of the Bible\r\nrespecting the Devil. One would have supposed, that, in carrying out\r\nthe mode of speaking of him as a person to this extent, it would have\r\noccurred to him, that it might be that the scriptural expressions of a\r\nsimilar kind were also mere personifications of moral and abstract\r\nideas. In describing the inattention, irreverence, and unholy\r\nreflections of his hearers as the operations of the Devil, it is\r\nwonderful that his eyes were not opened to discern the import of our\r\nSaviour's interpretation of the Parable of the Tares, in which he\r\ndeclares, that he understands by the Devil whatever obstructs the\r\ngrowth of virtue and piety in the soul, the causes that efface good\r\nimpressions and give a wrong inclination to the thoughts and\r\naffections, such as \"the cares of this world\" or \"the deceitfulness of\r\nriches.\" By these are the tares planted, and by these is their growth\r\npromoted. \"The enemy that sowed them is the Devil.\"\r\n\r\nSatan was regarded as the foe and opposer of all improvement in\r\nknowledge and civilization. The same writer thus quaintly expresses\r\nthis opinion: He \"has hindered mankind, for many ages, from hitting\r\nthose useful inventions which yet were so obvious and facile that it is\r\neverybody's wonder that they were not sooner hit upon. The bemisted\r\nworld must jog on for thousands of years without the knowledge of the\r\nloadstone, till a Neapolitan stumbled upon it about three hundred years\r\nago. Nor must the world be blessed with[i.393] such a matchless engine\r\nof learning and virtue as that of printing, till about the middle of\r\nthe fifteenth century. Nor could one old man, all over the face of the\r\nwhole earth, have the benefit of such a little, though most needful,\r\nthing as a pair of spectacles, till a Dutchman, a little while ago,\r\naccommodated us. Indeed, as the Devil does begrudge us all manner of\r\ngood, so he does annoy us with all manner of woe.\" In one of his\r\nsermons, Cotton Mather claimed for himself and his clerical brethren\r\nthe honor of being particularly obnoxious to the malice of the Evil\r\nOne. \"The ministers of God,\" says he, \"are more dogged by the Devil\r\nthan other persons are.\"\r\n\r\nWithout a knowledge of this sentiment, the witchcraft delusion of our\r\nfathers cannot be understood. They were under an impression, that the\r\nDevil, having failed to prevent the progress of knowledge in Europe,\r\nhad abandoned his efforts to obstruct it effectually there; had\r\nwithdrawn into the American wilderness, intending here to make a final\r\nstand; and had resolved to retain an undiminished empire over the whole\r\ncontinent and his pagan allies, the native inhabitants. Our fathers\r\naccounted for the extraordinary descent and incursions of the Evil One\r\namong them, in 1692, on the supposition that it was a desperate effort\r\nto prevent them from bringing civilization and Christianity within his\r\nfavorite retreat; and their souls were fired with the glorious thought,\r\nthat, by carrying on the war with vigor against him and his\r\nconfederates, the witches, they would become chosen and honored[i.394]\r\ninstruments in the hand of God for breaking down and abolishing the\r\nlast stronghold on the earth of the kingdom of darkness.\r\n\r\nThat this opinion was not merely a conceit of their vanity, or an\r\noverweening estimate of their local importance, but a calm, deliberate\r\nconviction entertained by others as well as themselves, can be shown by\r\nabundant evidence from the literature of that period. I will quote a\r\nsingle illustration of the form in which this thought occupied their\r\nminds. The subject is worthy of being thoroughly appreciated, as it\r\naffords the key that opens to view the motives and sentiments which\r\ngave the mighty impetus to the witchcraft prosecution here in New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nJoseph Mede, B.D., Fellow of Christ's College, in Cambridge, England,\r\ndied in 1638, at the age of fifty-three years. He was perhaps, all\r\nthings considered, the most profound scholar of his times. His writings\r\ngive evidence of a brilliant genius and an enlightened spirit. They\r\nwere held in the highest esteem by his contemporaries of all\r\ndenominations, and in all parts of Europe. He was a Churchman; but had,\r\nto a remarkable degree, the confidence of nonconformists. He\r\nentertained, as will appear by what follows, in the boldest form, the\r\nthen prevalent opinions concerning diabolical agency and influence;\r\nbut, at the same time, was singularly free from some of the worst\r\ntraits of superstition and bigotry. His intimacy with the learned Dr.\r\nWilliam Ames, and the general tone and tendency of his writings,\r\nnaturally made him an[i.395] authority with Protestants, particularly\r\nthe Pilgrims and Puritans of New England. His posthumous writings,\r\npublished in 1652, are exceedingly interesting. They contain fragments\r\nfound among his papers, brief discussions of points of criticism,\r\nphilosophy, and theology, and a varied correspondence on such subjects\r\nwith eminent men of his day. Among his principal correspondents was Dr.\r\nWilliam Twiss, himself a person of much ingenious learning, and whom\r\nJohn Norton, as we are told by Cotton Mather, \"loved and admired\" above\r\nall men of that age. The following passages between them illustrate the\r\npoint before us.\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated March 2, 1634, Twiss writes thus:—\r\n\r\n\"Now, I beseech you, let me know what your opinion is of our English\r\nplantations in the New World. Heretofore, I have wondered in my\r\nthoughts at the providence of God concerning that world; not discovered\r\ntill this Old World of ours is almost at an end; and then no footsteps\r\nfound of the knowledge of the true God, much less of Christ; and then\r\nconsidering our English plantations of late, and the opinion of many\r\ngrave divines concerning the gospel's fleeting westward. Sometimes I\r\nhave had such thoughts, Why may not _that_ be the place of the _New\r\nJerusalem_? But you have handsomely and fully cleared me from such odd\r\nconceits. But what, I pray? Shall our English there degenerate, and\r\njoin themselves with Gog and Magog? We have heard lately divers ways,\r\nthat our people there have no hope of the conversion of the natives.\r\nAnd, the very week after I received your last letter, I saw a letter,\r\nwritten from New[i.396] England, discoursing of an impossibility of\r\nsubsisting there; and seems to prefer the confession of God's truth in\r\nany condition here in Old England, rather than run over to enjoy their\r\nliberty there; yea, and that the gospel is like to be more dear in New\r\nEngland than in Old. And, lastly, unless they be exceeding careful, and\r\nGod wonderfully merciful, they are like to lose that life and zeal for\r\nGod and his truth in New England which they enjoyed in Old; as whereof\r\nthey have already woful experience, and many there feel it to their\r\nsmart.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mede's answer was as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"Concerning our plantations in the American world, I wish them as well\r\nas anybody; though I differ from them far, both in other things, and on\r\nthe grounds they go upon. And though there be but little hope of the\r\ngeneral conversion of those natives or any considerable part of that\r\ncontinent, yet I suppose it may be a work pleasing to Almighty God and\r\nour blessed Saviour to affront the Devil with the sound of the gospel\r\nand the cross of Christ, in those places where he had thought to have\r\nreigned securely, and out of the din thereof; and, though we make no\r\nChristians there, yet to bring some thither to disturb and vex him,\r\nwhere he reigned without check.\r\n\r\n\"For that I may reveal my conceit further, though perhaps I cannot\r\nprove it, yet I think thus,—that those countries were first inhabited\r\nsince our Saviour and his apostles' times, and not before; yea,\r\nperhaps, some ages after, there being no signs or footsteps found among\r\nthem, or any monuments of older habitation, as there is with us.\r\n\r\n\"That the Devil, being impatient of the sound of the gospel and cross\r\nof Christ, in every part of this Old World,[i.397] so that he could in\r\nno place be quiet for it; and foreseeing that he was like to lose all\r\nhere; so he thought to provide himself of a seed over which he might\r\nreign securely, and in a place _ubi nec Pelopidarum facta neque nomen\r\naudiret_. That, accordingly, he drew a colony out of some of those\r\nbarbarous nations dwelling upon the Northern Ocean (whither the sound\r\nof Christ had not yet come), and promising them by some oracle to show\r\nthem a country far better than their own (which he might soon do),\r\npleasant and large, where never man yet inhabited; he conducted them\r\nover those desert lands and islands (of which there are many in that\r\nsea) by the way of the north into America, which none would ever have\r\ngone, had they not first been assured there was a passage that way into\r\na more desirable country. Namely, as when the world apostatized from\r\nthe worship of the true God, God called Abraham out of Chaldee into the\r\nland of Canaan, of him to raise a seed to preserve a light unto his\r\nname: so the Devil, when he saw the world apostatizing from him, laid\r\nthe foundations of a new kingdom, by deducting this colony from the\r\nnorth into America, where they have increased since into an innumerable\r\nmultitude. And where did the Devil ever reign more absolutely, and\r\nwithout control, since mankind first fell under his clutches?\r\n\r\n\"And here it is to be noted, that the story of the Mexican kingdom\r\n(which was not founded above four hundred years before ours came\r\nthither) relates, out of their own memorials and traditions, that they\r\ncame to that place from the _north_, whence their god, _Vitziliputzli_,\r\nled them, going in an ark before them: and, after divers years' travel\r\nand many stations (like enough after some generations), they came to\r\nthe place which the sign he had given them at[i.398] their first\r\nsetting-forth pointed out; where they were to finish their travels,\r\nbuild themselves a _city_, and their god a _temple_, which is the place\r\nwhere Mexico was built. Now, if the Devil were God's ape in _this_, why\r\nmight he not be likewise in bringing the first colony of men into that\r\nworld out of ours? namely, by oracle, as God did Abraham out of\r\nChaldee, whereto I before resembled it.\r\n\r\n\"But see the hand of Divine Providence. When the offspring of these\r\n_runagates_ from the sound of Christ's gospel had now replenished that\r\nother world, and began to flourish in those two kingdoms of Peru and\r\nMexico, Christ our Lord sends his mastives, the Spaniards, to hunt them\r\nout, and worry them; which they did in so hideous a manner, as the like\r\nthereunto scarce ever was done since the sons of Noah came out of the\r\nark. What an affront to the Devil was this, where he had thought to\r\nhave reigned securely, and been for ever concealed from the knowledge\r\nof the followers of Christ!\r\n\r\n\"Yet the Devil perhaps is _less grieved_ for the loss of his servants\r\nby the _destroying_ of them, than he would be to lose them by the\r\n_saving_ of them; by which latter way, I doubt the Spaniards have\r\ndespoiled him but of a few. What, then, if Christ our Lord will give\r\nhim his _second affront_ with better Christians, which may be more\r\ngrievous to him than the former? And, if Christ shall set him up a\r\nlight in this manner to dazzle and torment the Devil at his own home, I\r\nhope they (viz., the Americans) shall not so far degenerate (not all of\r\nthem) as to come into that army of Gog and Magog against the kingdom of\r\nChrist, but be translated thither before the Devil be loosed; if not,\r\npresently after his tying up.\" [i.399]\r\n\r\nDr. Twiss, in a reply to the above, dated April 6, 1635, thanks Mede\r\nfor his letter, which he says he read \"with recreation and delight;\"\r\nand, particularly in reference to the \"peopling of the New World,\" he\r\naffirms that there is \"more in this letter of yours than formerly I\r\nhave been acquainted with. Your conceit thereabouts, if I have any\r\njudgment, is grave and ponderous.\"\r\n\r\nThis correspondence, while it serves as a specimen of the style of\r\nMede, is a remarkable instance of the power of a sagacious intellect to\r\npenetrate through the darkness of theoretical and fanciful errors, and\r\nbehold the truth that lies behind and beyond. The whole superstructure\r\nof the Devil, his oracles, and his schemes of policy and dominion,\r\ncovers, in this brief familiar epistle, what is, I suppose, the theory\r\nmost accredited at this day of the origin and traduction of the\r\naboriginal races of America, proceeding from the nearest portions of\r\nthe ancient continent on the North, and advancing down over the vast\r\nspaces towards Central and South America. The letter also foreshadows\r\nthe decisive conflict which is here to be waged between the elements of\r\nfreedom and slavery, between social and political systems that will\r\nrescue and exalt humanity, and those which depress and degrade it. In\r\nthe phraseology of that age, it was to be determined whether—the Old\r\nWorld, in the language of Twiss, \"being almost at an end\"—a \"light\"\r\nshould be \"set up\" here to usher in the \"kingdom of Christ,\"[i.400] or\r\nAmerica also be for ever given over to the \"army of Gog and Magog.\"\r\n\r\nOur fathers were justified in feeling that this was the sense of their\r\nresponsibility entertained by all learned men and true Christians in\r\nthe Old World; and they were ready to meet and discharge it faithfully\r\nand manfully. They were told, and they believed, that it had fallen to\r\ntheir lot to be the champions of the cross of Christ against the power\r\nof the Devil. They felt, as I have said, that they were fighting him in\r\nhis last stronghold, and they were determined to \"tie him up\" for ever.\r\n\r\nThis is the true and just explanation of their general policy of\r\nadministration, in other matters, as well as in the witchcraft\r\nprosecutions.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion to which we are brought, by a review of the seventeenth\r\ncentury up to the period when the prosecutions took place here, is,\r\nthat the witchcraft delusion pervaded the whole civilized world and\r\nevery profession and department of society. It received the sanction of\r\nall the learned and distinguished English judges who flourished within\r\nthe century, from Sir Edward Coke to Sir Matthew Hale. It was\r\ncountenanced by the greatest philosophers and physicians, and was\r\nembraced by men of the highest genius and accomplishments, even by Lord\r\nBacon himself. It was established by the convocation of bishops, and\r\npreached by the clergy. Dr. Henry More, of Christ's College, Cambridge,\r\nin addition to his admirable poetical and philosophical works, wrote\r\nvolumes to defend it. It[i.401] was considered as worthy of the study\r\nof the most cultivated and liberal minds to discover and distinguish \"a\r\ntrue witch by proper trials and symptoms.\" The excellent Dr. Calamy has\r\nalready been mentioned in this connection; and Richard Baxter wrote his\r\nwork entitled \"The Certainty of the World of Spirits,\" for the special\r\npurpose of confirming and diffusing the belief. He kept up a\r\ncorrespondence with Cotton Mather, and with his father, Increase\r\nMather, through the medium of which he stimulated and encouraged them\r\nin their proceedings against supposed witches in Boston and elsewhere.\r\nThe divines of that day seem to have persuaded themselves into the\r\nbelief that the doctrines of demonology were essential to the gospel,\r\nand that the rejection of them was equivalent to infidelity. A writer\r\nin one of our modern journals, in speaking of the prosecutions for\r\nwitchcraft, happily and justly observes, \"It was truly hazardous to\r\noppose those judicial murders. If any one ventured to do so, the\r\nCatholics burned him as a heretic, and the Protestants had a vehement\r\nlonging to hang him for an atheist.\" The writings of Dr. More, of\r\nBaxter, Glanvil, Perkins, and others, had been circulating for a long\r\ntime in New England before the trials began at Salem. It was such a\r\nreview of the history of opinion as we have now made, which led Dr.\r\nBentley to declare that \"the agency of invisible beings, if not a part\r\nof every religion, is not contrary to any one. It may be found in all\r\nages, and in the most remote countries. It is then no just subject for\r\nour admiration, that a[i.402] belief so alarming to our fears, so\r\nnatural to our prejudices, and so easily abused by superstition, should\r\nobtain among our fathers, when it had not been rejected in the ages of\r\nphilosophy, letters, and even revelation.\"\r\n\r\nThe works on demonology, the legal proceedings in prosecutions, and the\r\nphraseology of the people, gave more or less definite form to certain\r\nprominent points which may be summarily noticed. Several terms and\r\nexpressions were employed to characterize persons supposed to be\r\nconversant with supernatural and magic art; such as diviner, enchanter,\r\ncharmer, conjurer, necromancer, fortune-teller, soothsayer, augur, and\r\nsorcerer. These words are sometimes used as more or less synonymous,\r\nalthough, strictly speaking, they have meanings quite distinct. But\r\nnone of them convey the idea attached to the name of witch. It was\r\nsometimes especially used to signify a female, while wizard was\r\nexclusively applied to a male. The distinction was not, however, often\r\nattempted to be made; the former title being prevailingly applied to\r\neither sex. A witch was regarded as a person who had made an actual,\r\ndeliberate, formal compact with Satan, by which it was agreed that she\r\nshould become his faithful subject, and do all in her power to aid him\r\nin his rebellion against God and his warfare against the gospel and\r\nchurch of Christ; and, in consideration of such allegiance and service,\r\nSatan, on his part, agreed to exercise his supernatural powers in her\r\nfavor, and communicate to her those powers, in a greater or less[i.403]\r\ndegree, as she proved herself an efficient and devoted supporter of his\r\ncause. Thus, a witch was considered as a person who had transferred\r\nallegiance and worship from God to the Devil.\r\n\r\nThe existence of this compact was supposed to confer great additional\r\npower on the Devil, as well as on his new subject; for the doctrine\r\nseems to have prevailed, that, for him to act with effect upon men, the\r\nintervention, instrumentality, and co-operation of human beings was\r\nnecessary; and almost unlimited potency was ascribed to the combined\r\nexertions of Satan and those persons in league with him. A witch was\r\nbelieved to have the power, through her compact with the Devil, of\r\nafflicting, distressing, and rending whomsoever she would. She could\r\ncause them to pine away, throw them into the most frightful\r\nconvulsions, choke, bruise, pierce, and craze them, subjecting them to\r\nevery description of pain, disease, and torture, and even to death\r\nitself. She was believed to possess the faculty of being present, in\r\nher shape or apparition, at a different place, at any distance\r\nwhatever, from that which her actual body occupied. Indeed, an\r\nindefinite amount of supernatural ability, and a boundless freedom and\r\nvariety of methods for its exercise, were supposed to result from the\r\ndiabolical compact. Those upon whom she thus exercised her malignant\r\nand mysterious energies were said to be bewitched.\r\n\r\nBeside these infernal powers, the alliance with Satan was believed to\r\nconfer knowledge such as no other mortal possessed. The witch could\r\nperform the same[i.404] wonders, in giving information of the things\r\nthat belong to the invisible world, which is alleged in our day, by\r\nspirit-rappers, to be received through mediums. She could read inmost\r\nthoughts, suggest ideas to the minds of the absent, throw temptations\r\nin the path of those whom she desired to delude and destroy, bring up\r\nthe spirits of the departed, and hear from them the secrets of their\r\nlives and of their deaths, and their experiences in the scenes of being\r\non which they entered at their departure from this.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that these opinions were not merely prevalent among\r\nthe common people, but sanctioned by learning and philosophy, science\r\nand jurisprudence; that they possessed an authority, which but few\r\nventured to question and had been firmly established by the convictions\r\nof centuries,—none can be surprised at the alarm it created, when the\r\nbelief became current, that there were those in the community, and even\r\nin the churches, who had actually entered into this dark confederacy\r\nagainst God and heaven, religion and virtue; and that individuals were\r\nbeginning to suffer from their diabolical power. It cannot be\r\nconsidered strange, that men looked with more than common horror upon\r\npersons against whom what was regarded as overwhelming evidence was\r\nborne of having engaged in this conspiracy with all that was evil, and\r\nthis treason against all that was good.\r\n\r\nElaborate works, scientific, philosophical, and judicial in their\r\npretensions and reputation,—to some of which reference has been\r\nmade,—defined and par[i.405]ticularized the various forms of evidence\r\nby which the crime of confederacy with Satan could be proved.\r\n\r\nIt was believed that the Devil affixed his mark to the bodies of those\r\nin alliance with him, and that the point where this mark was made\r\nbecame callous and dead. The law provided, specifically, the means of\r\ndetecting and identifying this sign. It required that the prisoner\r\nshould be subjected to the scrutiny of a jury of the same sex, who\r\nwould make a minute inspection of the body, shaving the head and\r\nhandling every part. They would pierce it with pins; and if, as might\r\nhave been expected, particularly in aged persons, any spot could be\r\nfound insensible to the torture, or any excrescence, induration, or\r\nfixed discoloration, it was looked upon as visible evidence and\r\ndemonstration of guilt. A physician or \"chirurgeon\" was required to be\r\npresent at these examinations. In conducting them, there was liability\r\nto great roughness and unfeeling recklessness of treatment; and the\r\nwhole procedure was barbarous and shocking to every just and delicate\r\nsensibility. There is reason to believe, that, in the trials here,\r\nthere was more considerateness, humanity, and regard to a sense of\r\ndecent propriety, than in similar proceedings in other countries, so\r\nfar as this branch of the investigation is regarded.\r\n\r\nAnother accredited field of evidence, recognized in the books and in\r\nlegal proceedings, was as follows: It was believed, that, when witches\r\nfound it inconvenient from any cause to execute their infernal designs\r\nupon[i.406] those whom they wished to afflict by going to them in their\r\nnatural human persons, they transformed themselves into the likeness of\r\nsome animal,—a dog, hog, cat, rat, mouse, or toad; birds—particularly\r\nyellow birds—were often imagined to perform this service, as\r\nrepresenting witches or the Devil. They also had imps under their\r\ncontrol. These imps were generally supposed to bear the resemblance of\r\nsome small insect,—such as a fly or a spider. The latter animal was\r\nprevailingly considered as most likely to act in this character. The\r\naccused person was closely watched, in order that the spider imp might\r\nbe seen when it approached to obtain its nourishment, as it was thought\r\nto do, from the witchmark on the body of the culprit. Within the cells\r\nof a prison, spiders were, of course, often seen. Whenever one made its\r\nappearance, the guard attacked it with all the zeal and vehemence with\r\nwhich it was natural and proper to assault an agent of the Wicked One.\r\nIf the spider was killed in the encounter, it was considered as an\r\ninnocent animal, and all suspicion was removed from its character as\r\nthe diabolical confederate of the prisoner; but if it escaped into a\r\ncrack or crevice of the apartment, as spiders often do when assailed,\r\nall doubt of its guilty connection with the person accused of\r\nwitchcraft was removed: it was set down as, beyond question or cavil,\r\nher veritable imp; and the evidence of her confederacy with Satan was\r\nthenceforward regarded as complete. The books of law and other learned\r\nwritings, as well as the practice of courts in the old[i.407]\r\ncountries, recognized this doctrine of transformation into the shapes\r\nof animals, and the employment of imps. Where judicial tribunals\r\ncountenanced the popular credulity in maintaining these ideas, there\r\nwas no security for innocence, and no escape from wrong. No matter how\r\nclear and certain the evidence adduced, that an accused individual, at\r\nthe time alleged, was absent from the specified place; no matter how\r\nfar distant, whether twenty or a thousand miles, it availed him\r\nnothing; for it was charged that he was present, and acted through his\r\nagent or imp. This notion was further enlarged by the establishment of\r\nthe additional doctrine, that a witch could be present, and act with\r\ndemoniac power upon her victims, anywhere, at all times, and at any\r\ndistance, without the instrumental agency of any other animal or being,\r\nin her spirit, spectre, or apparition. When the person on trial was\r\naccused of having tortured or strangled or pinched or bruised another,\r\nit did not break the force of the accusation to bring hundreds of\r\nwitnesses to prove that he was, at the very time, in another remote\r\nplace or country; for it was alleged that he was present in the\r\nspectral shape in which Satan enabled his spirit to be and to act any\r\nand every where at once. It was impossible to disprove the charge, and\r\nthe last defence of innocence was swept away.\r\n\r\nIf any thing strange or remarkable could be discovered in the persons,\r\nhistories, or deportment of accused persons, the usage of the\r\ntribunals, and the books of authority on the subject, allowed it to be\r\nbrought in[i.408] evidence against them. If any thing they had\r\nforewarned, or even conjectured, happened to come to pass, any careless\r\nspeech had been verified by events, any extraordinary knowledge had\r\nbeen manifested, or any marvellous feats of strength or agility been\r\ndisplayed, they were brought up with decisive and fatal effect.\r\n\r\nA witch was believed to have the power of operating upon her victims,\r\nat any distance, by the instrumentality of puppets. She would procure\r\nor make an object like a doll, or a figure of some animal,—any little\r\nbunch of cloth or bundle of rags would answer the purpose. She would\r\nwill the puppet to represent the person whom she proposed to torment or\r\nafflict; and then whatever she did to the puppet would be suffered by\r\nthe party it represented at any distance, however remote. A pin stuck\r\ninto the puppet would pierce the flesh of the person whom she wished to\r\nafflict, and produce the appropriate sensations of pain. So would a\r\npinch, or a blow, or any kind of violence. When any one was arrested on\r\nthe charge of witchcraft, a search was immediately made for puppets\r\nfrom garret to cellar; and if any thing could be found that might\r\npossibly be imagined to possess that character,—any remnant of flannel\r\nor linen wrapped up, the foot of an old stocking, or a cushion of any\r\nkind, particularly if there were any pins in it,—it was considered as\r\nweighty and quite decisive evidence against the accused party.\r\n\r\nA writer, in a recent number of the \"North-Ameri[i.409]can Review,\" on\r\nthe superstitions of the American Indians, makes the following\r\nstatement:—\r\n\r\n\"The sorcerer, by charms, magic songs, magic feats, and the beating of\r\nhis drum, had power over the spirits, and those occult influences\r\ninherent in animals and inanimate things. He could call to him the\r\nsouls of his enemies. They appeared before him in the form of stones.\r\nHe chopped and bruised them with his hatchet; blood and flesh issued\r\nforth; and the intended victim, however distant, languished and died.\r\nLike the sorcerer of the middle ages, he made images of those he wished\r\nto destroy, and, muttering incantations, punctured them with an awl;\r\nwhereupon the persons represented sickened and pined away.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a received opinion, accredited and acted upon in courts, that a\r\nperson in confederacy with the Evil One could not weep. Those accused\r\nof this crime, both in Europe and America, were, in many instances, of\r\nan age and condition which rendered it impossible for them, however\r\ninnocent, to escape the effect of this test. A decrepit, emaciated\r\nperson, shrivelled and desiccated by age, was placed at the bar: and if\r\nshe could not weep on the spot; if, in consequence of her withered\r\nframe, her amazement and indignation at the false and malignant charges\r\nby which she was circumvented, her exhausted sensibility, her sullen\r\ndespair, the hopeless horror of her situation, or, from what often was\r\nfound to be the effect of the treatment such persons received, a\r\nhigh-toned consciousness of innocence, and a brave defiance and stern\r\ncondemnation of her maligners and persecutors; if, from any\r\ncause,[i.410] the fountain of tears was closed or dried up,—their\r\nfailure to come forth at the bidding of her defamers was regarded as a\r\nsure and irrefragable proof of her guilt.\r\n\r\nKing James explains the circumstance, that witches could not weep, in\r\nrather a curious manner:—\r\n\r\n\"For as, in a secret murther, if the dead carkasse bee at any time\r\nthereafter handled by the murtherer it will gush out of bloud, as if\r\nthe bloud were crying to the heaven for revenge of the murtherer, God\r\nhaving appointed that secret supernaturall signe for triall of that\r\nsecret unnaturall crime; so it appeares that God hath appointed (for a\r\nsupernaturall signe of the monstrous impietie of witches), that the\r\nwater shall refuse to receive them in her bosome that have shaken off\r\nthem the sacred water of baptisme, and wilfully refused the benefite\r\nthereof: no, not so much as their eyes are able to shed teares\r\n(threaten and torture them as ye please), while first they repent (God\r\nnot permitting them to dissemble their obstinacie in so horrible a\r\ncrime), albeit the woman kind especially be able otherwise to shed\r\nteares at every light occasion when they will,—yea, although it were\r\ndissemblingly like the crocodiles.\"\r\n\r\nReginald Scott, in introducing a Romish form of adjuration, makes the\r\nfollowing excellent remarks on the trial by tears:—\r\n\r\n\"But alas that teares should be thought sufficient to excuse or condemn\r\nin so great a cause, and so weightie a triall! I am sure that the worst\r\nsort of the children of Israel wept bitterlie; yea, if there were any\r\nwitches at all in Israel, they wept. For it is written, that all the\r\nchildren[i.411] of Israel wept. Finallie, if there be any witches in\r\nhell, I am sure they weepe; for there is weeping and wailing and\r\ngnashing of teeth. But God knoweth many an honest matron cannot\r\nsometimes in the heaviness of her heart shed teares; the which\r\noftentimes are more readie and common with crafty queans and strumpets\r\nthan with sober women. For we read of two kinds of teares in a woman's\r\neie; the one of true greefe, and the other of deceipt. And it is\r\nwritten, that 'Dediscere flere foeminam est mendacium;' which argueth\r\nthat they lie, which saie that wicked women cannot weepe. But let these\r\ntormentors take heed, that the teares in this case which runne down the\r\nwidowe's cheeks, with their crie, spoken of by Jesus Sirach, be not\r\nheard above. But, lo, what learned, godlie and lawful meanes these\r\nPopish Inquisitors have invented for the triall of true or false\r\nteares:—\r\n\r\n'I conjure thee, by the amorous tears which Jesus Christ, our Saviour,\r\nshed upon the crosse for the salvation of the world; and by the most\r\nearnest and burning teares of his mother, the most glorious Virgine\r\nMarie, sprinkled upon his wounds late in the evening; and by all the\r\nteares which everie saint and elect vessell of God hath poured out\r\nheere in the world, and from whose eies he hath wiped awaie all\r\nteares,—that, if thou be without fault, thou maist poure downe teares\r\naboundantlie; and, if thou be guiltie, that thou weep in no wise. In\r\nthe name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the Holie Ghost. Amen.'\r\n\r\n\"The more you conjure, the lesse she weepeth.\"\r\n\r\nA distinction was made between black and white witches. The former were\r\nthose who had leagued with Satan for the purpose of doing injury to\r\nothers,[i.412] while the latter class was composed of such persons as\r\nhad resorted to the arts and charms of divination and sorcery in order\r\nto protect themselves and others from diabolical influence. They were\r\nboth considered as highly, if not equally, criminal. Fuller, in his\r\n\"Profane State,\" thus speaks of them: \"Better is it to lap one's\r\npottage like a dog, than to eat it mannerly, with a spoon of the\r\nDevil's giving. Black witches hurt and do mischief; but, in deeds of\r\ndarkness, there is no difference of colors. The white and the black are\r\nboth guilty alike in compounding with the Devil.\" White witches\r\npretended to extract their power from the mysterious virtues of certain\r\nplants. The following form of charmed words was used in plucking them:—\r\n\r\n\"Hail to thee, holy herb,\r\nGrowing in the ground;\r\nOn the Mount of Calvarie,\r\nFirst wert thou found;\r\nThou art good for many a grief,\r\nAnd healest many a wound:\r\nIn the name of sweet Jesu,\r\nI lift thee from the ground.\"\r\n\r\nThen there was the evidence of ocular fascination. The accused and the\r\naccusers were brought into the presence of the examining magistrate,\r\nand the supposed witch was ordered to look upon the afflicted persons;\r\ninstantly upon coming within the glance of her eye, they would scream\r\nout, and fall down as in a fit. It was thought that an invisible and\r\nimpalpable fluid darted from the eye of the witch, and penetrated the\r\nbrain of the bewitched. By bringing the witch so[i.413] near that she\r\ncould touch the afflicted persons with her hand, the malignant fluid\r\nwas attracted back into her hand, and the sufferers recovered their\r\nsenses. It is singular to notice the curious resemblance between this\r\nopinion—the joint product of superstition and imposture—and the results\r\nto which modern science has led us in the discoveries of galvanism and\r\nanimal electricity. The doctrine of fascination maintained its hold\r\nupon the public credulity for a long time, and gave occasion to the\r\nphrase, still in familiar use among us, of \"looking upon a person with\r\nan evil eye.\" Its advocates claimed, in its defence, the authority of\r\nthe Cartesian philosophy; but it cannot be considered, in an age of\r\nscience and reason, as having any better support than the rural\r\nsuperstition of Virgil's simple shepherd, who thus complains of the\r\ncondition of his emaciated flock:—\r\n\r\n\"They look so thin,\r\nTheir bones are barely covered with their skin.\r\nWhat magic has bewitched the woolly dams?\r\nAnd what ill eyes beheld the tender lambs?\"\r\n\r\nWitchcraft, in all ages and countries, was recognized as a reality,\r\njust as much as any of the facts of nature, or incidents to which\r\nmankind is liable. By the laws of all nations, Catholic and Protestant\r\nalike, in the old country and in the new, it was treated as a capital\r\noffence, and classed with murder and other highest crimes, although\r\nregarded as of a deeper dye and blacker character than them all.\r\nIndictments and trials of persons accused of it were not,\r\ntherefore,[i.414] considered as of any special interest, or as\r\ndiffering in any essential particulars from proceedings against any\r\nother description of offenders. There had been many such proceedings in\r\nthe American colonies,—more, perhaps, than have come to our\r\nknowledge,—previous to 1692. They were not looked upon as sufficiently\r\nextraordinary to be transferred, from the oblivion sweeping like a\r\nperpetual deluge over the vast multitude of human experiences, to the\r\nark of history, which rescues only a select few. The following are the\r\nprincipal facts of this class of which we have information:—\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn presided, in his judicial character, at the trial of two\r\nSwedish women for witchcraft; the grand jury, acting under instructions\r\nfrom him, having found bills against them. They were saved, not in\r\nconsequence of any peculiar reluctance to proceed against them arising\r\nout of the nature of the alleged crime, but only from some technical\r\ndefect in the indictment. If it had not been for this accidental\r\ncircumstance, as the annalist of Philadelphia suggests, scenes similar\r\nto those subsequently occurring in Salem Village might have darkened\r\nthe history of the Quakers, Swedes, Germans, and Dutch, who dwelt in\r\nthe City of Brotherly Love and the adjacent colonies. There had been\r\ntrials and executions for witchcraft in other parts of New England, and\r\nexcitements had obtained more or less currency in reference to the\r\nassaults of the powers of darkness upon human affairs. These incidents\r\nprepared the way for the delusion in Salem, and[i.415] provided\r\nelements to form its character. They must not, therefore, be wholly\r\noverlooked. But the memorials for their elucidation are very defective.\r\nHutchinson's \"History of Massachusetts\" is, perhaps, the most valuable\r\nauthority on the subject. He enjoyed an advantage over any other\r\nwriter, before, since, or hereafter, so far as relates to the\r\nwitchcraft proceedings in 1692; for he had access to all the records\r\nand documents connected with it, a great part of which have\r\nsubsequently been lost or destroyed. His treatment of that particular\r\ntopic is more satisfactory than can elsewhere be found. But of\r\nincidents of the sort that preceded it, his information appears to have\r\nbeen very slight and unreliable. It is a singular fact, that we know\r\nmore of the history of the first century of New England than was known\r\nby the most enlightened persons of the intermediate century. There was\r\nno regular organized newspaper press, the commemorative age had not\r\nbegun, and none seem to have been fully aware of the importance of\r\nputting events on record. The publication, but a few years since, of\r\nthe colonial journals of the first half-century of Massachusetts;\r\nresearches by innumerable hands among papers on file in public offices;\r\nthe printing of town-histories, and the collections made by historical\r\nand genealogical societies,—have rescued from oblivion, and redeemed\r\nfrom error, many points of the greatest interest and importance.\r\n\r\nWinthrop, in his \"Journal,\" gives an account of the execution of\r\nMargaret Jones, of Charlestown, who had been tried and condemned by the\r\nCourt of Assistants.[i.416] The charges against her were, that she had\r\na malignant touch, so that many persons,—\"men, women, and children,\"—on\r\ncoming in contact with her, were \"taken with deafness, vomiting, or\r\nother violent pains or sickness;\" that she practised physic, and her\r\nmedicines, \"being such things as (by her own confession) were harmless,\r\nas aniseed, liquors, &c., yet had extraordinary violent effects;\" and\r\nthat they found on her body, \"upon a forced search,\" the witchmarks,\r\nparticularly \"a teat, as fresh if it had been newly sucked.\" Other\r\nridiculous allegations were made against her. As for the effects of the\r\ntouch, it is obvious that they could be easily simulated by\r\nevil-disposed persons. The whole substance of her offence seems to have\r\nbeen, that she was very successful in the use of simple prescriptions\r\nfor the cure of diseases. Her practice was charged as \"against the\r\nordinary course, and beyond the apprehension of all physicians and\r\nsurgeons.\" A bitter animosity was, accordingly, raised against her. She\r\ntreated her accusers and defamers with indignant resentment. \"Her\r\nbehavior at her trial,\" says Winthrop, \"was very intemperate, lying\r\nnotoriously, and railing upon the jury and witnesses, &c.; and, in the\r\nlike distemper, she died.\" We shall find that the bold assertion of\r\ninnocence, and indignant denunciations of the persecutors and defamers\r\nwho had destroyed their reputations and pursued them to the death, by\r\npersons tried and executed for witchcraft, in 1692, were regarded by\r\nsome, as they were by Winthrop, as proofs of ill-temper and falsehood.\r\nThe Governor closes his statement[i.417] about Margaret Jones, by\r\nrelating what he regarded as a demonstration of her guilt: \"The same\r\nday and hour she was executed, there was a very great tempest at\r\nConnecticut, which blew down many trees, &c.\" The records of the\r\nGeneral Court contain no express notice of this case. Perhaps it is\r\nreferred to in the following paragraph, under date of May 13, 1648:—\r\n\r\n\"This Court, being desirous that the same course which hath been taken\r\nin England for the discovery of witches, by watching, may also be taken\r\nhere, with the witch now in question, and therefore do order that a\r\nstrict watch be set about her every night, and that her husband be\r\nconfined to a private room, and watched also.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret Jones was executed in Boston on the 15th of June. Hutchinson\r\nrefers to the statement made by Johnson, in the \"Wonder-working\r\nProvidence,\" that \"more than one or two in Springfield, in 1645, were\r\nsuspected of witchcraft; that much diligence was used, both for the\r\nfinding them and for the Lord's assisting them against their witchery;\r\nyet have they, as is supposed, bewitched not a few persons, among whom\r\ntwo of the reverend elder's children.\" Johnson's loose and immethodical\r\nnarrative covers the period from 1645 till toward the end of 1651; and\r\nHutchinson was probably misled in supposing that the Springfield cases\r\noccurred as early as 1645. The Massachusetts colonial records, under\r\nthe date of May 8, 1651, have this entry:[i.418]—\r\n\r\n\"The Court, understanding that Mary Parsons, now in prison, accused for\r\na witch, is likely, through weakness, to die before trial, if it be\r\ndeferred, do order, that, on the morrow, by eight o'clock in the\r\nmorning, she be brought before and tried by the General Court, the\r\nrather that Mr. Pinchon may be present to give his testimony in the\r\ncase.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Pinchon was probably able to stay a few days longer. She was not\r\nbrought to trial before the Court until the 13th, under which date is\r\nthe following:—\r\n\r\n\"Mary Parsons, wife of Hugh Parsons, of Springfield, being committed to\r\nprison for suspicion of witchcraft, as also for murdering her own\r\nchild, was this day called forth, and indicted for witchcraft. 'By the\r\nname of Mary Parsons, you are here, before the General Court, charged,\r\nin the name of this Commonwealth, that, not having the fear of God\r\nbefore your eyes nor in your heart, being seduced by the Devil, and\r\nyielding to his malicious motion, about the end of February last, at\r\nSpringfield, to have familiarity, or consulted with, a familiar spirit,\r\nmaking a covenant with him; and have used divers devilish practices by\r\nwitchcraft, to the hurt of the persons of Martha and Rebecca Moxon,\r\nagainst the word of God and the laws of this jurisdiction, long since\r\nmade and published.' To which indictment she pleaded 'Not guilty.' All\r\nevidences brought in against her being heard and examined, the Court\r\nfound the evidences were not sufficient to prove her a witch, and\r\ntherefore she was cleared in that respect.\r\n\r\n\"At the same time, she was indicted for murdering her child. 'By the\r\nname of Mary Parsons, you are here, before the General Court, charged,\r\nin the name of this Common[i.419]wealth, that, not having the fear of\r\nGod before your eyes nor in your heart, being seduced by the Devil, and\r\nyielding to his instigations and the wickedness of your own heart,\r\nabout the beginning of March last, in Springfield, in or near your own\r\nhouse, did wilfully and most wickedly murder your own child, against\r\nthe word of God and the laws of this jurisdiction, long since made and\r\npublished.' To which she acknowledged herself guilty.\r\n\r\n\"The Court, finding her guilty of murder by her own confession, &c.,\r\nproceeded to judgment: 'You shall be carried from this place to the\r\nplace from whence you came, and from thence to the place of execution,\r\nand there hang till you be dead.'\"\r\n\r\nUnder the same date—May 13—is an order of the Court appointing a day of\r\nhumiliation \"throughout our jurisdiction in all the churches,\" in\r\nconsideration, among other things, of the extent to which \"Satan\r\nprevails amongst us in respect of witchcrafts.\"\r\n\r\nThe colonial records, under date of May 31, 1652, recite the facts,\r\nthat Hugh Parsons, of Springfield, had been tried before the Court of\r\nAssistants—held at Boston, May 12, 1652—for witchcraft; that the case\r\nwas transferred to a \"jury of trials,\" which found him guilty. The\r\nmagistrates not consenting to the verdict of the jury, the case came\r\nlegally to the General Court, which body decided that \"he was not\r\nlegally guilty of witchcraft, and so not to die by law.\"\r\n\r\nWhen these citations are collated and examined, and it is remembered\r\nthat Mr. Moxon was the \"reverend elder\" of the church at Springfield,\r\nit cannot be doubted[i.420] that the case of the Parsonses is that\r\nreferred to by Johnson in the \"Wonder-working Providence,\" and that\r\nHutchinson was in error as to the date. We are left in doubt as to the\r\nfate of Mary Parsons. There is a marginal entry on the records, to the\r\neffect that she was reprieved to the 29th of May. Neither Johnson nor\r\nHutchinson seem to have thought that the sentence was ever carried into\r\neffect. It clearly never ought to have been. The woman was in a weak\r\nand dying condition, her mind was probably broken down,—the victim of\r\nthat peculiar kind of mania—partaking of the character of a religious\r\nfanaticism and perversion of ideas—that has often led to child-murder.\r\n\r\nThese instances show, that, at that time, the General Court exercised\r\nconsideration and discrimination in the treatment of questions of this\r\nkind brought before it.\r\n\r\nHutchinson, on the authority of Hale, says that a woman at Dorchester,\r\nand another at Cambridge, were executed, not far from this time, for\r\nwitchcraft; and that they asserted their innocence with their dying\r\nbreath. He also says, that, in 1650, \"a poor wretch,—Mary\r\nOliver,—probably weary of her life from the general reputation of being\r\na witch, after long examination, was brought to a confession of her\r\nguilt; but I do not find that she was executed.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1656, a very remarkable case occurred. William Hibbins was a\r\nmerchant in Boston, and one of the most prominent and honored citizens\r\nof Massachusetts. He was admitted a freeman in 1640; was deputy in\r\nthe[i.421] General Court in that and the following year; was elected an\r\nassistant for twelve successive years,—from 1643 to 1654; represented\r\nthe Colony, for a time, as its agent in England, and received the\r\nthanks of the General Court for his valuable service there. No one\r\nappears to have had more influence, or to have enjoyed more honorable\r\ndistinction, during his long legislative career. He died in 1654.\r\nHutchinson says, in the text of his first and second volumes, that his\r\nwidow was tried, condemned, and hanged as a witch in 1655, although he\r\ncorrects the error in a note to the passage in the first volume. The\r\nfollowing is the statement of the case in the Massachusetts colonial\r\nrecords, under the date of May 14, 1656:—\r\n\r\n\"The magistrates not receiving the verdict of the jury in Mrs. Hibbins\r\nher case, having been on trial for witchcraft, it came and fell, of\r\ncourse, to the General Court. Mrs. Ann Hibbins was called forth,\r\nappeared at the bar, the indictment against her was read; to which she\r\nanswered, 'Not guilty,' and was willing to be tried by God and this\r\nCourt. The evidence against her was read, the parties witnessing being\r\npresent, her answers considered on; and the whole Court, being met\r\ntogether, by their vote, determined that Mrs. Ann Hibbins is guilty of\r\nwitchcraft, according to the bill of indictment found against her by\r\nthe jury of life and death. The Governor, in open Court, pronounced\r\nsentence accordingly; declaring she was to go from the bar to the place\r\nfrom whence she came, and from thence to the place of execution, and\r\nthere to hang till she was dead.\r\n\r\n\"It is ordered, that warrant shall issue out from the secretary to the\r\nmarshal general, for the execution of Mrs. Hib[i.422]bins, on the fifth\r\nday next come fortnight, presently after the lecture at Boston, being\r\nthe 19th of June next; the marshal general taking with him a sufficient\r\nguard.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hibbins is stated to have been a sister of Richard Bellingham, at\r\nthat very time deputy-governor, and always regarded as one of the chief\r\nmen in the country. Strange to say, very little notice appears to have\r\nbeen taken of this event, beyond the immediate locality; but what\r\nlittle has come down to us indicates that it was a case of outrageous\r\nfolly and barbarity, justly reflecting infamy upon the community at the\r\ntime. Hutchinson, who wrote a hundred years after the event, and\r\nevidently had no other foundation for his opinion than vague\r\nconjectural tradition, gives the following explanation of the\r\nproceedings against her: \"Losses, in the latter part of her husband's\r\nlife, had reduced his estate, and increased the natural crabbedness of\r\nhis wife's temper, which made her turbulent and quarrelsome, and\r\nbrought her under church censures, and at length rendered her so odious\r\nto her neighbors as to cause some of them to accuse her of witchcraft.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this is hardly worthy of being considered a sufficient\r\nexplanation of the matter,—it being beyond belief, that, even at that\r\ntime, a person could be condemned and executed merely on account of a\r\n\"crabbed temper,\"—it is not consistent with the facts, as made known to\r\nus from the record-offices. She could not have been so reduced in\r\ncircumstances as to produce such extraordinary effects upon her\r\ncharacter, for she[i.423] left a good estate. The truth is, that the\r\ntongue of slander was let loose upon her, and the calumnies circulated\r\nby reckless gossip became so magnified and exaggerated, and assumed\r\nsuch proportions, as enabled her vilifiers to bring her under the\r\ncensure of the church, and that emboldened them to cry out against her\r\nas a witch. Hutchinson expresses the opinion that she was the victim of\r\npopular clamor. But that alone, without some pretence or show of\r\nevidence, could not have brought the General Court, in reversal of the\r\njudgment of the magistrates, to condemn to death a person of such a\r\nhigh social position.\r\n\r\nThe only clue we have to the kind of evidence bearing upon the charge\r\nof witchcraft that brought this recently bereaved widow to so cruel and\r\nshameful a death, is in a letter, written by a clergyman in Jamaica to\r\nIncrease Mather in 1684, in which he says, \"You may remember what I\r\nhave sometimes told you your famous Mr. Norton once said at his own\r\ntable,—before Mr. Wilson, the pastor, elder Penn, and myself and wife,\r\n&c., who had the honor to be his guests,—that one of your magistrate's\r\nwives, as I remember, was hanged for a witch only for having more wit\r\nthan her neighbors. It was his very expression; she having, as he\r\nexplained it, unhappily guessed that two of her persecutors, whom she\r\nsaw talking in the street, were talking of her, which, proving true,\r\ncost her her life, notwithstanding all he could do to the contrary, as\r\nhe himself told us.\" Nothing was more natural than for her to suppose,\r\nknowing the parties, witnessing their[i.424] manner, considering their\r\nactive co-operation in getting up the excitement against her, which was\r\nthen the all-engrossing topic, that they were talking about her. But,\r\nin the blind infatuation of the time, it was considered proof positive\r\nof her being possessed, by the aid of the Devil, of supernatural\r\ninsight,—precisely as, forty years afterwards, such evidence was\r\nbrought to bear, with telling effect, against George Burroughs.—The\r\nbody of this unfortunate lady was searched for witchmarks, and her\r\ntrunks and premises rummaged for puppets.\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident that means were used to get up a violent popular\r\nexcitement against her, which became so formidable as to silence every\r\nvoice that dared to speak in her favor. Joshua Scottow, a citizen of\r\ngreat respectability and a selectman, ventured to give evidence in her\r\nfavor, counter, in its bearings, to some testimony against her; and he\r\nwas dealt with very severely, and compelled to write an humble apology\r\nto the Court, to disavow all friendly interest in Mrs. Hibbins, and to\r\npray \"that the sword of justice may be drawn forth against all\r\nwickedness.\" He says, \"I am cordially sorry that any thing from me,\r\neither by word or writing, should give offence to the honored Court, my\r\ndear brethren in the church, or any others.\"\r\n\r\nHutchinson states that there were, however, some persons then in\r\nBoston, who denounced the proceedings against Mrs. Hibbins, and\r\nregarded her, not merely as a persecuted woman, but as \"a saint;\" that\r\na deep feeling of resentment against her persecutors long[i.425]\r\nremained in their minds; and that they afterwards \"observed solemn\r\nmarks of Providence set upon those who were very forward to condemn\r\nher.\" It is evident that the Court of Magistrates were opposed to her\r\nconviction, and that Mr. Norton did what he could to save her. He was\r\none of the four \"great Johns,\" who were the first ministers of the\r\nchurch in Boston; and it is remarkable, as showing the violence of the\r\npeople against her, that even his influence was of no avail in her\r\nfavor. But she had other friends, as appears from her will, which,\r\nafter all, is the only source of reliable information we have\r\nrespecting her character. It is dated May 27, 1656, a few days after\r\nshe received the sentence of death. In it she names, as overseers and\r\nadministrators of her estate, \"Captain Thomas Clarke, Lieutenant Edward\r\nHutchinson, Lieutenant William Hudson, Ensign Joshua Scottow, and\r\nCornet Peter Oliver.\" In a codicil, she says, \"I do earnestly desire my\r\nloving friends, Captain Johnson and Mr. Edward Rawson, to be added to\r\nthe rest of the gentlemen mentioned as overseers of my will.\" It can\r\nhardly be doubted, that these persons—and they were all leading\r\ncitizens—were known by her to be among her friends.\r\n\r\nThe whole tone and manner of these instruments give evidence, that she\r\nhad a mind capable of rising above the power of wrong, suffering, and\r\ndeath itself. They show a spirit calm and serene. The disposition of\r\nher property indicates good sense, good feeling, and business faculties\r\nsuitable to the occasion. In the[i.426] body of the will, there is not\r\na word, a syllable, or a turn of expression, that refers to, or is in\r\nthe slightest degree colored by, her peculiar situation. In the\r\ncodicil, dated June 16, there is this sentence: \"My desire is, that all\r\nmy overseers would be pleased to show so much respect unto my dead\r\ncorpse as to cause it to be decently interred, and, if it may be, near\r\nmy late husband.\"\r\n\r\nWhen married to Mr. Hibbins, she was a widow, named Moore. There were\r\nno children by her last marriage,—certainly none living at the time of\r\nher death. There were three sons by her former marriage,—John, Joseph,\r\nand Jonathan. These were all in England; but the youngest, hearing of\r\nher situation, embarked for America. When she wrote the codicil,—three\r\ndays before her execution,—she added, at the end, having apparently\r\njust heard of his coming, \"I give my son Jonathan twenty pounds, over\r\nand above what I have already given him, towards his pains and charge\r\nin coming to see me, which shall be first paid out of my estate.\" There\r\nis reason to cherish the belief that he reached her in the short\r\ninterval between the date of the codicil and her death, from the tenor\r\nof the following postscript, written and signed on the morning of her\r\nexecution: \"My further mind and will is, out of my sense of the more\r\nthan ordinary affection and pains of my son Jonathan in the times of my\r\ndistress, I give him, as a further legacy, ten pounds.\" The will was\r\nproved in Court, July 2, 1656. The will and codicil speak of her \"farms\r\nat Muddy River;\" and[i.427] of chests and a desk, in which were\r\nvaluables of such importance that she took especial pains to intrust\r\nthe keys of them to Edward Rawson, in a provision of the codicil. The\r\nestate was inventoried at £344. 14_s._, which was a considerable\r\nproperty in those days, as money was then valued.\r\n\r\nHutchinson mentions a case of witchcraft in Hartford, in 1662, where\r\nsome women were accused, and, after being proceeded against until they\r\nwere confounded and bewildered, one of them made the most preposterous\r\nconfessions, which ought to have satisfied every one that her reason\r\nwas overthrown; three of them were condemned, and one,\r\ncertainly,—probably all,—executed. In 1669, he says that Susanna\r\nMartin, of Salisbury,—whom we shall meet again,—was bound over to the\r\nCourt on the same charge, \"but escaped at that time.\" Another case is\r\nmentioned by him as having occurred, in 1671, at Groton, in which the\r\nparty confessed, and thereby avoided condemnation. In 1673, a case\r\noccurred at Hampton; but the jury, although, as they said, there was\r\nstrong ground of suspicion, returned a verdict of \"Not guilty;\" the\r\nevidence not being deemed quite sufficient. There were several other\r\ncases, about this time, in which some persons were severely handled in\r\nconsequence of being reputed witches; and others suffered, as they\r\nimagined, \"under an evil hand.\"\r\n\r\nIn this immediate neighborhood, there had been several attempts,\r\nprevious to the delusion at Salem Village in 1692, to get up witchcraft\r\nprosecutions,[i.428] but without much success. The people of this\r\ncounty had not become sufficiently infected with the fanaticism of the\r\ntimes to proceed to extremities.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1652, the following presentment was made by the grand\r\njury:—\r\n\r\n\"We present John Bradstreet, of Rowley, for suspicion of having\r\nfamiliarity with the Devil. He said he read in a book of magic, and\r\nthat he heard a voice asking him what work he had for him. He answered,\r\n'Go make a bridge of sand over the sea; go make a ladder of sand up to\r\nheaven, and go to God, and come down no more.'\r\n\r\n\"Witness hereof, Francis Parat and his wife, of Rowley.\r\n\"Witness, William Bartholomew, of Ipswich.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of that month, the jury at Ipswich, \"upon examination of\r\nthe case, found he had told a lie, which was a second, being convicted\r\nonce before. The Court sets a fine of twenty shillings, or else to be\r\nwhipped.\"\r\n\r\nBradstreet was probably in the habit of romancing, and it was wisely\r\nconcluded not to take a more serious view of his offences.\r\n\r\nIn 1658, a singular case of this kind occurred in Essex County. The\r\nfollowing papers relating to it illustrate the sentiments and forms of\r\nthought prevalent at that time, and give an insight of the state of\r\nsociety in some particulars:—\r\n\r\n_\"To the Honored Court to be holden at Ipswich, this twelfth month, '58\r\nor '59._\r\n\r\n\"Honored Gentlemen,—Whereas divers of esteem with us, and as we hear in\r\nother places also, have for[i.429] some time suffered losses in their\r\nestates, and some affliction in their bodies also,—which, as they\r\nsuppose, doth not arise from any natural cause, or any neglect in\r\nthemselves, but rather from some ill-disposed person,—that, upon\r\ndifferences had betwixt themselves and one John Godfrey, resident at\r\nAndover or elsewhere at his pleasure, we whose names are underwritten\r\ndo make bold to sue by way of request to this honored court, that you,\r\nin your wisdom, will be pleased, if you see cause for it, to call him\r\nin question, and to hear, at present or at some after sessions, what\r\nmay be said in this respect.\r\n\r\n\"James Davis, Sr., in the behalf of his son Ephraim Davis.\r\nJohn Haseldin, and Jane his wife.\r\nAbraham Whitaker, for his ox and other things.\r\nEphraim Davis, in the behalf of himself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe petitioners mention in brief some instances in confirmation of\r\ntheir complaint. There are several depositions. That of Charles Browne\r\nand wife says:—\r\n\r\n\"About six or seven years since, in the meeting-house of Rowley, being\r\nin the gallery in the first seat, there was one in the second seat\r\nwhich he doth, to his best remembrance, think and believe it was John\r\nGodfrey. This deponent did see him, yawning, open his mouth; and, while\r\nhe so yawned, this deponent did see a small teat under his tongue. And,\r\nfurther, this deponent saith that John Godfrey was in this deponent's\r\nhouse about three years since. Speaking about the power of witches, he\r\nthe said Godfrey spoke, that, if witches were not kindly entertained,\r\nthe Devil will appear unto them, and ask them if they were grieved or\r\nvexed with anybody, and ask them what he should do for them; and,\r\nif[i.430] they would not give them beer or victuals, they might let all\r\nthe beer run out of the cellar; and, if they looked steadfastly upon\r\nany creature, it would die; and, if it were hard to some witches to\r\ntake away life, either of man or beast, yet, when they once begin it,\r\nthen it is easy to them.\"\r\n\r\nThe depositions in this case are presented as they are in the originals\r\non file, leaving in blank such words or parts of words as have been\r\nworn off. They are given in full.\r\n\r\n\"The Deposition of Isabel Holdred, who testifieth that John Godfree\r\ncame to the house of Henry Blazdall, where her husband and herself\r\nwere, and demanded a debt of her husband, and said a warrant was out,\r\nand Goodman Lord was suddenly to come. John Godfree asked if we would\r\nnot pay him. The deponent answered, 'Yes, to-night or to-morrow, if we\r\nhad it; for I believe we shall not ... we are in thy debt.' John\r\nGodfree answered, 'That is a bitter word;' ... said, 'I must begin, and\r\nmust send Goodman Lord.' The deponent answered, '... when thou wilt. I\r\nfear thee not, nor all the devils in hell!' And, further, this deponent\r\ntestifieth, that, two days after this, she was taken with those strange\r\nfits, with which she was tormented a fortnight together, night and day.\r\nAnd several apparitions appeared to the deponent in the night. The\r\nfirst night, a humble-bee, the next night a bear, appeared, which\r\ngrinned the teeth and shook the claw: 'Thou sayest thou art not afraid.\r\nThou thinkest Harry Blazdall's house will save thee.' The deponent\r\nanswered, 'I hope the Lord Jesus Christ will save me.' The apparition\r\nthen spake: 'Thou sayst thou art not afraid of all the devils in hell;\r\nbut I will[i.431] have thy heart's blood within a few hours!' The next\r\nwas the apparition of a great snake, at which the deponent was\r\nexceedingly affrighted, and skipt to Nathan Gold, who was in the\r\nopposite chimney-corner, and caught hold of the hair of his head; and\r\nher speech was taken away for the space of half an hour. The next night\r\nappeared a great horse; and, Thomas Hayne being there, the deponent\r\ntold him of it, and showed him where. The said Tho. Hayne took a stick,\r\nand struck at the place where the apparition was; and his stroke\r\nglanced by the side of it, and it went under the table. And he went to\r\nstrike again; then the apparition fled to the ... and made it shake,\r\nand went away. And, about a week after, the deponent ... son were at\r\nthe door of Nathan Gold, and heard a rushing on the ... The deponent\r\nsaid to her son, 'Yonder is a beast.' He answered, ''Tis one of Goodman\r\nCobbye's black oxen;' and it came toward them, and came within ...\r\nyards of them. The deponent her heart began to ache, for it seemed to\r\nhave great eyes; and spoke to the boy, 'Let's go in.' But suddenly the\r\nox beat her up against the wall, and struck her down; and she was much\r\nhurt by it, not being able to rise up. But some others carried me into\r\nthe house, all my face being bloody, being much bruised. The boy was\r\nmuch affrighted a long time after; and, for the space of two hours, he\r\nwas in a sweat that one might have washed hands on his hair. Further\r\nthis deponent affirmeth, that she hath been often troubled with ...\r\nblack cat sometimes appearing in the house, and sometimes in the night\r\n... bed, and lay on her, and sometimes stroking her face. The cat\r\nseemed ... thrice as big as an ordinary cat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thomas Hayne testifieth, that, being with Goodwife Holdridge, she told\r\nme that she saw a great horse, and[i.432] showed me where it stood. I\r\nthen took a stick, and struck on the place, but felt nothing; and I\r\nheard the door shake, and Good. H. said it was gone out at the door.\r\nImmediately after, she was taken with extremity of fear and pain, so\r\nthat she presently fell into a sweat, and I thought she would swoon.\r\nShe trembled and shook like a leaf.\r\n\r\n\"Thomas Hayne.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nathan Gould being with Goodwife Holgreg one night, there appeared a\r\ngreat snake, as she said, with open mouth; and she, being weak,—hardly\r\nable to go alone,—yet then ran and laid hold of Nathan Gould by the\r\nhead, and could not speak for the space of half an hour.\r\n\r\n\"Nathan Gould.\"\r\n\r\n\"William Osgood testifieth, that, in the yeare '40, in the month of\r\nAugust,—he being then building a barn for Mr. Spencer,—John Godfree\r\nbeing then Mr. Spencer's herdsman, he on an evening came to the frame,\r\nwhere divers men were at work, and said that he had gotten a new master\r\nagainst the time he had done keeping cows. The said William Osgood\r\nasked him who it was. He answered, he knew not. He again asked him\r\nwhere he dwelt. He answered, he knew not. He asked him what his name\r\nwas. He answered, he knew not. He then said to him, 'How, then, wilt\r\nthou go to him when thy time is out?' He said, 'The man will come and\r\nfetch me then.' I asked him, 'Hast thou made an absolute bargain?' He\r\nanswered that a covenant was made, and he had set his hand to it. He\r\nthen asked of him whether he had not a counter covenant. Godfree\r\nanswered, 'No.' W.O. said, 'What a mad fellow art thou to make a\r\ncovenant in this manner!' He said, 'He's an honest man.'—'How knowest\r\nthou?' said W.O. J. Godfree answered. 'He looks like one.' W.O.\r\nthen[i.433] answered, 'I am persuaded thou hast made a covenant with\r\nthe Devil.' He then skipped about, and said, 'I profess, I profess!'\r\n\r\nWilliam Osgood.\"\r\n\r\nThe proceedings against Godfrey were carried up to other tribunals, as\r\nappears by a record of the County Court at Salem, 28th of June, 1659:—\r\n\r\n\"John Godfrey stands bound in one hundred pound bond to the treasurer\r\nof this county for his appearance at a General Court, or Court of\r\nAssistants, when he shall be legally summonsed thereunto.\"\r\n\r\nWhat action, if any, was had by either of these high courts, I have\r\nfound no information. But he must have come off unscathed; for, soon\r\nafter, he commenced actions in the County Court for defamation against\r\nhis accusers; with the following results:—\r\n\r\n\"John Godfery plt. agst. Will. Simonds & Sam.ll his son dfts. in an\r\naction of slander that the said Sam.ll son to Will. Simons, hath don\r\nhim in his name, Charging him to be a witch, the jury find for the plt.\r\n2d damage & cost of Court 29sh., yet notwithstanding doe conceiue, that\r\nby the testmonyes he is rendred suspicious.\"\r\n\r\n\"John Godfery plt. agst. Jonathan Singletary defendt. in an action of\r\nSlander & Defamation for calling him witch & said is this witch on this\r\nside Boston Gallows yet, the attachm.t & other evidences were read,\r\ncommitted to the Jury & are on file. The Jury found for the plt. a\r\npublique acknowledgmt, at Haverhill within a month that he hath done\r\nthe plt. wrong in his words or 10sh damage & costs of Court £2-16-0.\"\r\n[i.434]\r\n\r\nIn the trial of the case between Godfrey and Singletary, the latter\r\nattempted to prove the truth of his allegations against the former, by\r\ngiving the following piece of testimony, which, while it failed to\r\nconvince the jury, is worth preserving, from the inherent interest of\r\nsome of its details:—\r\n\r\n\"Date the fourteenth the twelfth month, '62.—The Deposition of Jonathan\r\nSingletary, aged about 23, who testifieth that I, being in the prison\r\nat Ipswich this night last past between nine and ten of the clock at\r\nnight, after the bell had rung, I being set in a corner of the prison,\r\nupon a sudden I heard a great noise as if many cats had been climbing\r\nup the prison walls, and skipping into the house at the windows, and\r\njumping about the chamber; and a noise as if boards' ends or stools had\r\nbeen thrown about, and men walking in the chambers, and a crackling and\r\nshaking as if the house would have fallen upon me. I seeing this, and\r\nconsidering what I knew by a young man that kept at my house last\r\nIndian Harvest, and, upon some difference with John Godfre, he was\r\npresently several nights in a strange manner troubled, and complaining\r\nas he did, and upon consideration of this and other things that I knew\r\nby him, I was at present something affrighted; yet considering what I\r\nhad lately heard made out by Mr. Mitchel at Cambridge, that there is\r\nmore good in God than there is evil in sin, and that although God is\r\nthe greatest good, and sin the greatest evil, yet the first Being of\r\nevil cannot weane the scales or overpower the first Being of good: so\r\nconsidering that the author of good was of greater power than the\r\nauthor of evil, God was pleased of his goodness to keep me from being\r\nout of measure frighted. So this noise above[i.435]said held as I\r\nsuppose about a quarter of an hour, and then ceased: and presently I\r\nheard the bolt of the door shoot or go back as perfectly, to my\r\nthinking, as I did the next morning when the keeper came to unlock it;\r\nand I could not see the door open, but I saw John Godfre stand within\r\nthe door and said, 'Jonathan, Jonathan.' So I, looking on him, said,\r\n'What have you to do with me?' He said, 'I come to see you: are you\r\nweary of your place yet?' I answered, 'I take no delight in being here,\r\nbut I will be out as soon as I can.' He said, 'If you will pay me in\r\ncorn, you shall come out.' I answered, 'No: if that had been my intent,\r\nI would have paid the marshal, and never have come hither.' He,\r\nknocking of his fist at me in a kind of a threatening way, said he\r\nwould make me weary of my part, and so went away, I knew not how nor\r\nwhich way; and, as I was walking about in the prison, I tripped upon a\r\nstone with my heel, and took it up in my hand, thinking that if he came\r\nagain I would strike at him. So, as I was walking about, he called at\r\nthe window, 'Jonathan,' said he, 'if you will pay me corn, I will give\r\nyou two years day, and we will come to an agreement;' I answered him\r\nsaying, 'Why do you come dissembling and playing the Devil's part here?\r\nYour nature is nothing but envy and malice, which you will vent, though\r\nto your own loss; and you seek peace with no man.'—'I do not\r\ndissemble,' said he: 'I will give you my hand upon it, I am in\r\nearnest.' So he put his hand in at the window, and I took hold of it\r\nwith my left hand, and pulled him to me; and with the stone in my right\r\nhand I thought I struck him, and went to recover my hand to strike\r\nagain, and his hand was gone, and I would have struck, but there was\r\nnothing to strike: and how he went away I know not; for I could[i.436]\r\nneither feel when his hand went out of mine, nor see which way he\r\nwent.\"\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be doubted, that Singletary's story was the result of the\r\nworkings of an excited imagination, in wild and frightful dreams under\r\nthe spasms of nightmare. We shall meet similar phenomena, when we come\r\nto the testimony in the trials of 1692.\r\n\r\nGodfrey was a most eccentric character. He courted and challenged the\r\nimputation of witchcraft, and took delight in playing upon the\r\ncredulity of his neighbors, enjoying the exhibition of their amazement,\r\nhorror, and consternation. He was a person of much notoriety, had more\r\nlawsuits, it is probable, than any other man in the colony, and in one\r\ninstance came under the criminal jurisdiction for familiarity with\r\nother than immaterial spirits; for we find, by the record of Sept. 25,\r\n1666, that John Godfrey was \"fined for being drunk.\"\r\n\r\nI have allowed so much space to the foregoing documents, because they\r\nshow the fancies which, fermenting in the public mind, and inflamed by\r\nthe prevalent literature, theology, and philosophy, came to a head\r\nthirty years afterwards; and because they prove that in 1660 a\r\nconviction for witchcraft could not be obtained in this county. The\r\nevidence against none of the convicts in 1692, throwing out of view the\r\nstatements and actings of the \"afflicted children,\" was half so strong\r\nas that against Godfrey. Short work would have been made with him then.\r\n\r\nThere is one particularly interesting item in Single[i.437]tary's\r\ndeposition. It illustrates the value of good preaching. This young man,\r\nin his gloomy prison, and overwhelmed with the terrors of superstition,\r\nfound consolation, courage, and strength in what he remembered of a\r\nsermon, to which he had happened to listen, from \"Matchless Mitchel.\"\r\nIt was indeed good doctrine; and it is to be lamented that it was not\r\ncarried out to its logical conclusions, and constantly enforced by the\r\ndivines of that and subsequent times.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1669, there was a prosecution of \"Goody Burt,\" a widow,\r\nconcerning whom the most marvellous stories were told. The principal\r\nwitness against her was Philip Reed, a physician, who on oath declared\r\nhis belief that \"no natural cause\" could produce such effects as were\r\nwrought by Goody Burt upon persons whom she afflicted. Her range of\r\noperations seems to have been confined to Marblehead, Lynn, Salem, and\r\nthe vicinity: as nothing more was ever heard of the case, another\r\nevidence is afforded, that an Essex jury, notwithstanding this positive\r\nopinion of a doctor, was not ready to convict on the charge of\r\nwitchcraft. This same Philip Reed tried very hard to prosecute\r\nproceedings, eleven years afterwards, against Margaret Gifford as a\r\nwitch. But she failed to appear, and no effort is recorded as having\r\nbeen made to apprehend her.\r\n\r\nIn 1673, Eunice Cole, of Hampton, was tried before a county court, at\r\nSalisbury, on the charge of witchcraft; and she was committed to jail,\r\nin Boston, for[i.438] further proceedings. She was subsequently\r\nindicted by the Grand Jury for the Massachusetts jurisdiction for\r\n\"familiarity with the Devil.\" The Court of Assistants found that there\r\nwas \"just ground of vehement suspicion of her having had familiarity\r\nwith the Devil,\" and got rid of the case by ordering her \"to depart\r\nfrom and abide out of this jurisdiction.\"\r\n\r\nAt a County Court, held at Salem, Nov. 24, 1674, a case was brought up,\r\nof which the following is all we know:—\r\n\r\n\"Christopher Browne having reported that he had been treating or\r\ndiscoursing with one whom he apprehended to be the Devil, which came\r\nlike a gentleman, in order to his binding himself to be a servant to\r\nhim, upon his examination, his discourse seeming inconsistent with\r\ntruth, &c., the Court, giving him good counsel and caution, for the\r\npresent dismiss him.\"\r\n\r\nIt would have been well if the action of this Court had been followed\r\nas an authoritative precedent.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1679, the house of William Morse, of Newbury, was, for more\r\nthan two months, infested in a most strange and vexatious manner. The\r\naffair was brought into court, where it played a conspicuous part, and\r\nwas near reaching a tragical conclusion. The history of the proceedings\r\nin reference to it is very curious.\r\n\r\nMr. John Woodbridge, of Newbury, had been for some time an associate\r\ncounty judge, and was commissioned to administer oaths and join persons\r\nin marriage. The following is a record of what occurred[i.439] before\r\nhim, sitting as a magistrate, and as a commissioner to adjudicate in\r\nsmall, local causes, and hold examinations in matters that went to\r\nhigher courts:—\r\n\r\n\"Dec. 3, 1679.—Caleb Powell, being complained of for suspicion of\r\nworking with the Devil to the molesting of William Morse and his\r\nfamily, was by warrant directed to the constable brought in by him. The\r\naccusation and testimonies were read, and the complaint respited till\r\nthe Monday following.\r\n\r\n\"Dec. 8, 1679.—Caleb Powell appeared according to order, and further\r\ntestimony produced against him by William Morse, which being read and\r\nconsidered, it was determined that the said William Morse should\r\nprosecute the case against said Powell at the County Court to be held\r\nat Ipswich the last Tuesday in March ensuing; and, in order hereunto,\r\nWilliam Morse acknowledgeth himself indebted to the Treasurer of the\r\nCounty of Essex the full sum of twenty pounds. The condition of this\r\nobligation is, that the said William Morse shall prosecute his\r\ncomplaint against Caleb Powell at that Court.\r\n\r\n\"Caleb Powell was delivered as a prisoner to the constable till he\r\ncould find security of twenty pounds for the answering of the said\r\ncomplaint, or else he was to be carried to prison.\r\n\r\n\"Jo: Woodbridge, _Commissioner_.\"\r\n\r\nPowell was accordingly brought before the Court at Ipswich, March 30,\r\n1680, under an indictment for witchcraft. Before giving the substance\r\nof the evidence adduced on this occasion, it will be well to mention\r\nthe manner in which he got into the case as[i.440] a principal. He was\r\na mate of a vessel. While at home, between voyages, he happened to hear\r\nof the wonderful occurrences at Mr. Morse's house. His curiosity was\r\nawakened, and he was also actuated by feelings of commiseration for the\r\nfamily under the torments and terrors with which they were said to be\r\nafflicted. Determined to see what it all meant, and to put a stop to it\r\nif he could, he went to the house, and soon became satisfied that a\r\nroguish grandchild was the cause of all the trouble. He prevailed upon\r\nthe old grandparents to let him take off the boy. Immediately upon his\r\nremoval, the difficulty ceased.\r\n\r\nNew-England navigators, at that time and long afterwards, sailed almost\r\nwholly by the stars; and Powell probably had often related his own\r\nskill, which, as mate of a vessel, he would have been likely to\r\nacquire, in calculating his position, rate of sailing, and distances,\r\non the boundless and trackless ocean, by his knowledge and observations\r\nof the heavenly bodies. He had said, perhaps, that, by gazing among the\r\nstars, he could, at any hour of the night, however long or far he had\r\nbeen tossed and driven on the ocean, tell exactly where his vessel was.\r\nHence the charge of being an astrologist. Probably, like other sailors,\r\nPowell may have indulged in \"long yarns\" to the country people, of the\r\nwonders he had seen, \"some in one country, and some in another.\" It is\r\nnot unlikely, that, in foreign ports, he had witnessed exhibitions of\r\nnecromancy and mesmerism, which, in various forms and under different\r\nnames,[i.441] have always been practised. Possibly he may have boasted\r\nto be a medium himself, a scholar and adept in the mystic art, able to\r\nread and divine \"the workings of spirits.\" At any rate, when it became\r\nknown, that, at a glance, he attributed to the boy the cause of the\r\nmischief, and that it ceased on his taking him away from the house, the\r\nopinion became settled that he was a wizard. He was arrested forthwith,\r\nand brought to trial, as has been stated, for witchcraft. His\r\nastronomy, astrology, and spiritualism brought him in peril of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\"The Testimony of William Morse: which saith, together with his wife,\r\naged both about sixty-five years: that, Thursday night, being the\r\ntwenty-seventh day of November, we heard a great noise without, round\r\nthe house, of knocking the boards of the house, and, as we conceived,\r\nthrowing of stones against the house. Whereupon myself and wife looked\r\nout and saw nobody, and the boy all this time with us; but we had\r\nstones and sticks thrown at us, that we were forced to retire into the\r\nhouse again. Afterwards we went to bed, and the boy with us; and then\r\nthe like noise was upon the roof of the house.\r\n\r\n\"2. The same night about midnight, the door being locked when we went\r\nto bed, we heard a great hog in the house grunt and make a noise, as we\r\nthought willing to get out; and, that we might not be disturbed in our\r\nsleep, I rose to let him out, and I found a hog in the house and the\r\ndoor unlocked: the door was firmly locked when we went to bed.\r\n\r\n\"3. The next morning, a stick of links hanging in the chimney, they\r\nwere thrown out of their place, and we[i.442] hanged them up again, and\r\nthey were thrown down again, and some into the fire.\r\n\r\n\"4. The night following, I had a great awl lying in the window, the\r\nwhich awl we saw fall down out of the chimney into the ashes by the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\"5. After this, I bid the boy put the same awl into the cupboard, which\r\nwe saw done, and the door shut to: this same awl came presently down\r\nthe chimney again in our sight, and I took it up myself. Again, the\r\nsame night, we saw a little Indian basket, that was in the loft before,\r\ncome down the chimney again. And I took the same basket, and put a\r\npiece of brick into it, and the basket with the brick was gone, and\r\ncame down again the third time with the brick in it, and went up again\r\nthe fourth time, and came down again without the brick; and the brick\r\ncame down again a little after.\r\n\r\n\"6. The next day, being Saturday, stones, sticks, and pieces of bricks\r\ncame down, so that we could not quietly dress our breakfast; and sticks\r\nof fire also came down at the same time.\r\n\r\n\"7. That day in the afternoon, my thread four times taken away, and\r\ncame down the chimney; again, my awl and gimlet, wanting, came down the\r\nchimney; again, my leather, taken away, came down the chimney; again,\r\nmy nails, being in the cover of a firkin, taken away, came down the\r\nchimney. Again, the same night, the door being locked, a little before\r\nday, hearing a hog in the house, I rose, and saw the hog to be mine: I\r\nlet him out.\r\n\r\n\"8. The next day being sabbath-day, many stones and sticks and pieces\r\nof bricks came down the chimney: on the Monday, Mr. Richardson and my\r\nbrother being there, the frame of my cowhouse they saw very firm. I\r\nsent my boy[i.443] out to scare the fowls from my hog's meat: he went\r\nto the cowhouse, and it fell down, my boy crying with the hurt of the\r\nfall. In the afternoon, the pots hanging over the fire did dash so\r\nvehemently one against the other, we set down one that they might not\r\ndash to pieces. I saw the andiron leap into the pot, and dance and leap\r\nout, and again leap in and dance and leap out again, and leap on a\r\ntable and there abide, and my wife saw the andiron on the table: also I\r\nsaw the pot turn itself over, and throw down all the water. Again, we\r\nsaw a tray with wool leap up and down, and throw the wool out, and so\r\nmany times, and saw nobody meddle with it. Again, a tub his hoop fly\r\noff of itself and the tub turn over, and nobody near it. Again, the\r\nwoollen wheel turned upside down, and stood up on its end, and a spade\r\nset on it; Steph. Greenleafe saw it, and myself and my wife. Again, my\r\nrope-tools fell down upon the ground before my boy could take them,\r\nbeing sent for them; and the same thing of nails tumbled down from the\r\nloft into the ground, and nobody near. Again, my wife and boy making\r\nthe bed, the chest did open and shut: the bed-clothes could not be made\r\nto lie on the bed, but fly off again.\r\n\r\n\"Again, Caleb Powell came in, and, being affected to see our trouble,\r\ndid promise me and my wife, that, if we would be willing to let him\r\nkeep the boy, we should see ourselves that we should be never disturbed\r\nwhile he was gone with him: he had the boy, and had been quiet ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\n\"Tho. Rogers and George Hardy, being at William Morse his house, affirm\r\nthat the earth in the chimney-corner moved, and scattered on them; that\r\nTho. Rogers was hit with somewhat, Hardy with an iron ladle as is\r\nsupposed. Somewhat hit William Morse a great blow, but it was so swift\r\nthat they could not certainly tell what it was; but,[i.444] looking\r\ndown after they heard the noise, they saw a shoe. The boy was in the\r\ncorner at the first, afterwards in the house.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Richardson on Saturday testifieth that a board flew against his\r\nchair, and he heard a noise in another room, which he supposed in all\r\nreason to be diabolical.\r\n\r\n\"John Dole saw a pine stick of candlewood to fall down, a stone, a\r\nfirebrand; and these things he saw not what way they came, till they\r\nfell down by him.\r\n\r\n\"The same affirmed by John Tucker: the boy was in one corner, whom they\r\nsaw and observed all the while, and saw no motion in him.\r\n\r\n\"Elizabeth Titcomb affirmeth that Powell said that he could find the\r\nwitch by his learning, if he had another scholar with him: this she\r\nsaith were his expressions, to the best of her memory.\r\n\r\n\"Jo. Tucker affirmeth that Powell said to him, he saw the boy throw the\r\nshoe while he was at prayer.\r\n\r\n\"Jo. Emerson affirmeth that Powell said he was brought up under\r\nNorwood; and it was judged by the people there, that Norwood studied\r\nthe black art.\r\n\r\n\"A further Testimony of William Morse and his Wife.—We saw a keeler of\r\nbread turn over against me, and struck me, not any being near it, and\r\nso overturned. I saw a chair standing in the house, and not anybody\r\nnear: it did often bow towards me, and so rise up again. My wife also\r\nbeing in the chamber, the chamber-door did violently fly together, not\r\nanybody being near it. My wife, going to make a bed, it did move to and\r\nfro, not anybody being near it. I also saw an iron wedge and spade was\r\nflying out of the chamber on my wife, and did not strike her. My wife\r\ngoing into the cellar, a drum, standing in the house, did roll[i.445]\r\nover the door of the cellar; and, being taken up again, the door did\r\nviolently fly down again. My barn-doors four times unpinned, I know not\r\nhow. I, going to shut my barn-door, looking for the pin,—the boy being\r\nwith me, as I did judge,—the pin, coming down out of the air, did fall\r\ndown near to me. Again, Caleb Powell came in, as beforesaid, and,\r\nseeing our spirits very low by the sense of our great affliction, began\r\nto bemoan our condition, and said that he was troubled for our\r\nafflictions, and said that he had eyed this boy, and drawed near to us\r\nwith great compassion: 'Poor old man, poor old woman! this boy is the\r\noccasion of your grief; for he hath done these things, and hath caused\r\nhis good old grandmother to be counted a witch.' 'Then,' said I, 'how\r\ncan all these things be done by him?' Said he, 'Although he may not\r\nhave done all, yet most of them; for this boy is a young rogue, a vile\r\nrogue: I have watched him, and see him do things as to come up and\r\ndown.' Caleb Powell also said he had understanding in astrology and\r\nastronomy, and knew the working of spirits, some in one country, and\r\nsome in another; and, looking on the boy, said, 'You young rogue, to\r\nbegin so soon. Goodman Morse, if you be willing to let me have this\r\nboy, I will undertake you shall be free from any trouble of this kind\r\nwhile he is with me.' I was very unwilling at the first, and my wife;\r\nbut, by often urging me, till he told me whither, and what employment\r\nand company, he should go, I did consent to it, and this was before Jo.\r\nBadger came; and we have been freed from any trouble of this kind ever\r\nsince that promise, made on Monday night last, to this time, being\r\nFriday in the afternoon. Then we heard a great noise in the other room,\r\noftentimes, but, looking after it, could not see any thing; but,\r\nafterwards looking into the room, we saw a board hanged to the press.\r\nThen[i.446] we, being by the fire, sitting in a chair, my chair often\r\nwould not stand still, but ready to throw me backward oftentimes.\r\nAfterward, my cap almost taken off my head three times. Again, a great\r\nblow on my poll, and my cat did leap from me into the chimney corner.\r\nPresently after, this cat was thrown at my wife. We saw the cat to be\r\nours: we put her out of the house, and shut the door. Presently, the\r\ncat was throwed into the house. We went to go to bed. Suddenly,—my wife\r\nbeing with me in bed, the lamp-light by our side,—my cat again throwed\r\nat us five times, jumping away presently into the floor; and, one of\r\nthose times, a red waistcoat throwed on the bed, and the cat wrapped up\r\nin it. Again, the lamp, standing by us on the chest, we said it should\r\nstand and burn out; but presently was beaten down, and all the oil\r\nshed, and we left in the dark. Again, a great voice, a great while,\r\nvery dreadful. Again, in the morning, a great stone, being six-pound\r\nweight, did remove from place to place,—we saw it,—two spoons throwed\r\noff the table, and presently the table throwed down. And, being minded\r\nto write, my inkhorn was hid from me, which I found, covered with a\r\nrag, and my pen quite gone. I made a new pen; and, while I was writing,\r\none ear of corn hit me in the face, and fire, sticks, and stones\r\nthrowed at me, and my pen brought to me. While I was writing with my\r\nnew pen, my inkhorn taken away: and, not knowing how to write any more,\r\nwe looked under the table, and there found him; and so I was able to\r\nwrite again. Again, my wife her hat taken from her head, sitting by the\r\nfire by me, the table almost thrown down. Again, my spectacles thrown\r\nfrom the table, and thrown almost into the fire by me, and my wife and\r\nthe boy. Again, my book of all my accounts thrown into the fire, and\r\nhad been burnt presently, if I had not taken it up. Again,[i.447]\r\nboards taken off a tub, and set upright by themselves; and my paper, do\r\nwhat I could, hardly keep it while I was writing this relation, and\r\nthings thrown at me while a-writing. Presently, before I could dry my\r\nwriting, a mormouth hat rubbed along it; but I held so fast that it did\r\nblot but some of it. My wife and I, being much afraid that I should not\r\npreserve it for public use, did think best to lay it in the Bible, and\r\nit lay safe that night. Again, the next, I would lay it there again;\r\nbut, in the morning, it was not there to be found, the bag hanged down\r\nempty; but, after, was found in a box alone. Again, while I was writing\r\nthis morning, I was forced to forbear writing any more, I was so\r\ndisturbed with so many things constantly thrown at me.\r\n\r\n\"This relation brought in Dec. 8.\r\n\r\n\"I, Anthony Morse, occasionally being at my brother Morse's house, my\r\nbrother showed me a piece of a brick which had several times come down\r\nthe chimney. I sitting in the corner, I took the piece of brick in my\r\nhand. Within a little space of time, the piece of brick was gone from\r\nme, I knew not by what means. Quickly after, the piece of brick came\r\ndown the chimney. Also, in the chimney-corner I saw a hammer on the\r\nground: there being no person near the hammer, it was suddenly gone, by\r\nwhat means I know not. But, within a little space after, the hammer\r\ncame down the chimney. And, within a little space of time after that,\r\ncame a piece of wood down the chimney, about a foot long; and, within a\r\nlittle after that, came down a firebrand, the fire being out. This was\r\nabout ten days ago.\r\n\r\n\"John Badger affirmeth, that, being at William Morse his house, and\r\nheard Caleb Powell say that he thought by astrology, and I think he\r\nsaid by astronomy too, with it, he could find out whether or no there\r\nwere diabolical means[i.448] used about the said Morse his trouble, and\r\nthat the said Caleb said he thought to try to find it out.\r\n\r\n\"The Deposition of Mary Tucker, aged about twenty.—She remembered that\r\nCaleb Powell came into her house, and said to this purpose: That he,\r\ncoming to William Morse his house, and the old man, being at prayer, he\r\nthought not fit to go in, but looked in at the window; and he said he\r\nhad broken the enchantment; for he saw the boy play tricks while he was\r\nat prayer, and mentioned some, and, among the rest, that he saw him to\r\nfling the shoe at the said Morse's head.\r\n\r\n\"Taken on oath, March 29, 1680, before me,\r\n\r\n\"Jo: Woodbridge, _Commissioner_.\r\n\r\n\"Mary Richardson confirmed the truth of the above written testimony, on\r\noath, at the same time.\"\r\n\r\nThere seem to have been several hearings before Commissioner\r\nWoodbridge. The boy had returned to his grandparents before the last\r\ndeposition of William Morse, and his audacious operations were\r\npersisted in to the last. The final decision of the Court was as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n\"Upon the hearing the complaint brought to this Court against Caleb\r\nPowell for suspicion of working by the Devil to the molesting of the\r\nfamily of William Morse of Newbury, though this court cannot find any\r\nevident ground of proceeding further against the said Caleb Powell, yet\r\nwe determine that he hath given such ground of suspicion of his so\r\ndealing that we cannot so acquit him, but that he justly deserves to\r\nbear his own share and the costs of the prosecution of the complaint.\r\n\r\n\"Referred to Mr. Woodbridge to examine and determine the charges.\"\r\n[i.449]\r\n\r\nThe entry of this sentence, in the records of the County Court, is as\r\nfollows; the clerk strangely mistaking the name of the party:—\r\n\r\n\"The Court held at Ipswich, the 30th of March, 1680.\r\n\r\n\"In the case of Abell Powell, though the Court do not see sufficient to\r\ncharge further, yet find so much suspicion as that he pay the charges.\r\nThe ordering of the charges left to Mr. Jo: Woodbridge.\"\r\n\r\nThe matter of Powell's connection with the affair being thus disposed\r\nof, and no one seeming to entertain his idea of the guilt of the boy,\r\nthe next step was to fasten suspicion upon the good old grandmother;\r\nand a general outcry was raised against her. Her arrest and\r\ncondemnation were clamored for. But the result of Powell's trial, and\r\nall preceding cases, showed that an Essex jury could not yet be relied\r\non for a conviction in witchcraft cases; and it was resolved to\r\ninstitute proceedings in a more favorable quarter. The Grand Jury\r\nreturned a bill of indictment against her to the Court of Assistants,\r\nsitting in Boston. This was the highest tribunal in the country,\r\nsubject only to the General Court, and embracing the whole colony in\r\nits jurisdiction. The following is the substance of the record of the\r\ncase:—\r\n\r\nAt a Court of Assistants, on adjournment, held at Boston, on the 20th\r\nof May, 1680.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Jury having presented Elizabeth Morse, wife of William Morse,\r\nshe was tried and convicted of the crime of witchcraft. The Governor,\r\non the 27th[i.450] of May, \"after the lecture,\" in the First Church of\r\nBoston, pronounced the sentence of death upon her. On the 1st of June,\r\nthe Governor and Assistants voted to reprieve her \"until the next\r\nsession of the Court in Boston.\" At the said next session, the\r\nreprieval was still further continued. This seems to have produced much\r\ndissatisfaction, as is shown by the following extract from the records\r\nof the House of Deputies:—\r\n\r\n\"The Deputies, on perusal of the Acts of the Honored Court of\r\nAssistants, relating to the woman condemned for witchcraft, do not\r\nunderstand the reason why the sentence, given against her by said\r\nCourt, is not executed: and the second reprieval seems to us beyond\r\nwhat the law will allow, and do therefore judge meet to declare\r\nourselves against it, with reference to the concurrence of the honored\r\nmagistrates hereto.\r\n\r\nWilliam Torrey, _Clerk_.\"\r\n\r\nThe action of the magistrates, on this reference, is recorded as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n\"3d of November, 1680.—Not consented to by magistrates.\r\n\r\nEdward Rawson, Secretary.\"\r\n\r\nThe evidence against Mrs. Morse was frivolous to the last degree,\r\nwithout any of the force and effect given to support the prosecutions\r\nin Salem, twelve years afterwards, by the astounding confessions of the\r\naccused, and the splendid acting of the \"afflicted children;\" yet she\r\nwas tried and condemned in Boston, and sentenced there on\r\n\"Lecture-day.\" The representatives of the people, in the House of\r\nDeputies, cried out against her reprieve. She was saved[i.451] by the\r\ncourage and wisdom of Governor Bradstreet, subsequently a resident of\r\nSalem, where his ashes rest. He was living here, at the age of ninety\r\nyears, during the witchcraft prosecutions in 1692; but, old as he was,\r\nhe made known his entire disapprobation of them. It is safe to say,\r\nthat, if he had not been superseded by the arrival of Sir William\r\nPhipps as governor under the new charter, they would never have taken\r\nplace. Notwithstanding all this,—in spite of the remonstrances, at the\r\ntime, of Brattle, and afterwards of Hutchinson,—Boston and other towns\r\n(earlier, if not equally, committed to such proceedings) have, by a\r\nsort of general conspiracy, joined the rest of the world in trying to\r\nthrow and fasten the whole responsibility and disgrace of witchcraft\r\nprosecutions upon Salem.\r\n\r\nThings continued in the condition just described,—Mrs. Morse in jail\r\nunder sentence of death; that sentence suspended by reprieves from the\r\nGovernor, from time to time, until the next year, when her husband, in\r\nher behalf and in her name, presented an earnest and touching petition\r\n\"to the honored Governor, Deputy-governor, Magistrates, and Deputies\r\nnow assembled in Court, May the 18th, 1681,\" that her case might be\r\nconcluded, one way or another. After referring to her condemnation, and\r\nto her attestation of innocence, she says, \"By the mercy of God, and\r\nthe goodness of the honored Governor, I am reprieved.\" She begs the\r\nCourt to \"hearken to her cry, a poor prisoner.\" She places herself at\r\nthe foot of the tribunal[i.452] of the General Court: \"I now stand\r\nhumbly praying your justice in hearing my case, and to determine\r\ntherein as the Lord shall direct. I do not understand law, nor do I\r\nknow how to lay my case before you as I ought; for want of which I\r\nhumbly beg of your honors that my request may not be rejected.\" The\r\nHouse of Deputies, on the 24th of May, voted to give her a new trial.\r\nBut the magistrates refused to concur in the vote; and so the matter\r\nstood, for how long a time there are, I believe, no means of knowing.\r\nFinally, however, she was released from prison, and allowed to return\r\nto her own house. This we learn from a publication made by Mr. Hale, of\r\nBeverly, in 1697. It seems, that, after getting her out of prison and\r\nrestored to her home, to use Mr. Hale's words, \"her husband, who was\r\nesteemed a sincere and understanding Christian by those that knew him,\r\ndesired some neighbor ministers, of whom I was one, to discourse his\r\nwife, which we did; and her discourse was very Christian, and still\r\npleaded her innocence as to that which was laid to her charge.\" From\r\nMr. Hale's language, it may be inferred that she had not been pardoned\r\nor discharged, but still lay under sentence of death, after her removal\r\nto her own house: for he and his brethren did not \"esteem it prudence\r\nto pass any definite sentence upon one under her circumstances;\" but\r\nthey ventured to say that they were \"inclined to the more charitable\r\nside.\" Mr. Hale states, that, \"in her last sickness, she was in much\r\ntrouble and darkness of spirit, which occasioned a[i.453] judicious\r\nfriend to examine her strictly, whether she had been guilty of\r\nwitchcraft; but she said _no_, but the ground of her trouble was some\r\nimpatient and passionate speeches and actions of hers while in prison,\r\nupon the account of her suffering wrongfully, whereby she had provoked\r\nthe Lord by putting contempt upon his Word. And, in fine, she sought\r\nher pardon and comfort from God in Christ; and died, so far as I\r\nunderstand, praying to and relying upon God in Christ for salvation.\"\r\n\r\nThe cases of Margaret Jones, Ann Hibbins, and Elizabeth Morse\r\nillustrate strikingly and fully the history and condition of the public\r\nmind in New England, and the world over, in reference to witchcraft in\r\nthe seventeenth century. They show that there was nothing\r\nunprecedented, unusual, or eminently shocking, after all, in what I am\r\nabout to relate as occurring in Salem, in 1692. The only real offence\r\nproved upon Margaret Jones was that she was a successful practitioner\r\nof medicine, using only simple remedies. Ann Hibbins was the victim of\r\nthe slanderous gossip of a prejudiced neighborhood; all our actual\r\nknowledge of her being her Will, which proves that she was a person of\r\nmuch more than ordinary dignity of mind, which was kept unruffled and\r\nserene in the bitterest trials and most outrageous wrongs which it is\r\npossible for folly and \"man's inhumanity to man\" to bring upon us in\r\nthis life. Elizabeth Morse appears to have been one of the best of\r\nChristian women. The accusations against them, as a whole, cover nearly\r\nthe[i.454] whole ground upon which the subsequent prosecutions in Salem\r\nrested. John Winthrop passed sentence upon Margaret Jones, John\r\nEndicott upon Ann Hibbins, and Simon Bradstreet upon Elizabeth Morse.\r\nThe last-named governor performed the office as an unavoidable act of\r\nofficial duty, and prevented the execution of the sentence by the\r\ncourageous use of his prerogative, in defiance of public clamor and the\r\nwrath of the representatives of the whole people of the colony. These\r\nfacts sufficiently show, that the proceedings afterwards had in Salem\r\naccorded with those in like cases, of that and preceding generations;\r\nand were sanctioned by the all but universal sentiments of mankind and\r\na uniform chain of precedents.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Bridget Bishop, in 1680, before the County Court at Salem,\r\nfor witchcraft, and her acquittal, have already been mentioned in the\r\naccount of Salem Village, in the First Part.\r\n\r\nIn 1688, an Irish woman, named Glover, was executed in Boston for\r\nbewitching four children belonging to the family of a Mr. Goodwin. She\r\nwas a Roman Catholic, represented to have been quite an ignorant\r\nperson, and seems, moreover, from the accounts given of her, to have\r\nbeen crazy. The oldest of the children was only about thirteen years of\r\nage. The most experienced physicians pronounced them bewitched. Their\r\nconduct, as it is related by Cotton Mather, was indeed very\r\nextraordinary. At one time they would bark like dogs, and then again\r\nthey would purr like[i.455] cats. \"Yea,\" says he, \"they would fly like\r\ngeese, and be carried with an incredible swiftness, having but just\r\ntheir toes now and then upon the ground, sometimes not once in twenty\r\nfeet, and their arms waved like the wings of a bird.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the children seems to have had a genius scarcely inferior to\r\nthat of Master Burke himself: there was no part nor passion she could\r\nnot enact. She would complain that the old Irish woman had tied an\r\ninvisible noose round her neck, and was choking her; and her complexion\r\nand features would instantly assume the various hues and violent\r\ndistortions natural to a person in such a predicament. She would\r\ndeclare that an invisible chain was fastened to one of her limbs, and\r\nwould limp about precisely as though it were really the case. She would\r\nsay that she was in an oven; the perspiration would drop from her face,\r\nand she would exhibit every appearance of being roasted: then she would\r\ncry out that cold water was thrown upon her, and her whole frame would\r\nshiver and shake. She pretended that the evil spirit came to her in the\r\nshape of an invisible horse; and she would canter, gallop, trot, and\r\namble round the rooms and entries in such admirable imitation, that an\r\nobserver could hardly believe that a horse was not beneath her, and\r\nbearing her about. She would go up stairs with exactly such a toss and\r\nbound as a person on horseback would exhibit.\r\n\r\nAfter some time, Cotton Mather took her into his own family, to see\r\nwhether he could not exorcise her.[i.456] His account of her conduct,\r\nwhile there, is highly amusing for its credulous simplicity. The\r\ncunning and ingenious child seems to have taken great delight in\r\nperplexing and playing off her tricks upon the learned man. Once he\r\nwished to say something in her presence, to a third person, which he\r\ndid not intend she should understand. He accordingly spoke in Latin.\r\nBut she had penetration enough to conjecture what he had said: he was\r\namazed. He then tried Greek: she was equally successful. He next spoke\r\nin Hebrew: she instantly detected the meaning. At last he resorted to\r\nthe Indian language, and that she pretended not to know. He drew the\r\nconclusion that the evil being with whom she was in compact was\r\nacquainted familiarly with the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, but not with\r\nthe Indian tongue.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to notice how adroitly she fell into the line of his\r\nprejudices. He handed her a book written by a Quaker, to which sect it\r\nis well known he was violently opposed: she would read it off with\r\ngreat ease, rapidity, and pleasure. A book written against the Quakers\r\nshe could not read at all. She could read Popish books, but could not\r\ndecipher a syllable of the Assembly's Catechism. Dr. Mather was\r\nearnestly opposed to the order and liturgy of the Church of England.\r\nThe artful little girl worked with great success upon this prejudice.\r\nShe pretended to be very fond of the Book of Common Prayer, and called\r\nit her Bible. It would relieve her of her sufferings, in a moment, to\r\nput it into her hands. While she could[i.457] not read a word of the\r\nScriptures in the Bible, she could read them very easily in the\r\nPrayer-book; but she could not read the Lord's Prayer even in this her\r\nfavorite volume. All these things went far to strengthen the conviction\r\nof Dr. Mather that she was in league with the Devil; for this was the\r\nonly explanation that could be given to satisfy his mind of her\r\npartiality to the productions of Quakers, Catholics, and Episcopalians,\r\nand her aversion to the Bible and the Catechism.\r\n\r\nShe exhibited the most exquisite ingenuity in beguiling Dr. Mather by\r\nthe force of a charm, the power of which he could not resist for a\r\nmoment,—flattery. He thus describes, with a complacency but thinly\r\nconcealed under the veil of affected modesty, the part she played, in\r\norder to give the impression—which it was the great object of his\r\nambition to make upon the public mind—that the Devil stood in special\r\nfear of his presence:—\r\n\r\n\"There then stood open the study of one belonging to the family, into\r\nwhich, entering, she stood immediately on her feet, and cried out,\r\n'They are gone! they are gone! They say that they cannot,—God won't let\r\n'em come here!' adding a reason for it which the owner of the study\r\nthought more kind than true; and she presently and perfectly came to\r\nherself, so that her whole discourse and carriage was altered into the\r\ngreatest measure of sobriety.\"\r\n\r\nUpon quitting the study, \"the demons\" would instantly again take hold\r\nof her. Mather continues the statement, by saying that some persons,\r\nwishing to try[i.458] the experiment, had her brought \"up into the\r\nstudy;\" but he says that she at once became—\r\n\r\n\"so strangely distorted, that it was an extreme difficulty to drag her\r\nup stairs. The demons would pull her out of the people's hands, and\r\nmake her heavier than, perhaps, three of herself. With incredible toil\r\n(though she kept screaming, 'They say I must not go in'), she was\r\npulled in; where she was no sooner got, but she could stand on her\r\nfeet, and, with altered note, say, 'Now I am well.' She would be faint\r\nat first, and say 'she felt something to go out of her' (the noises\r\nwhereof we sometimes heard like those of a mouse); but, in a minute or\r\ntwo, she could apply herself to devotion. To satisfy some strangers,\r\nthe experiment was, divers times, with the same success, repeated,\r\nuntil my lothness to have any thing done like making a charm of a room,\r\ncaused me to forbid the repetition of it.\"\r\n\r\nEven in her most riotous proceedings, she kept her eye fixed upon the\r\ndoctor's weak point. When he called the family to prayers, she would\r\nwhistle and sing and yell to drown his voice, would strike him with her\r\nfist, and try to kick him. But her hand or foot would always recoil\r\nwhen within an inch or two of his body; thus giving the idea that there\r\nwas a sort of invisible coat of mail, of heavenly temper, and proof\r\nagainst the assaults of the Devil, around his sacred person! After a\r\nwhile, Dr. Mather concluded to prepare an account of these\r\nextraordinary circumstances, wherewithal to entertain his congregation\r\nin a sermon. She seemed to be quite displeased at the thought of his\r\nmaking public the doings of her master, the Evil[i.459] One, attempted\r\nto prevent his writing the intended sermon, and disturbed and\r\ninterrupted him in all manner of ways. For instance, she once knocked\r\nat his study door, and said that \"there was somebody down stairs that\r\nwould be glad to see him.\" He dropped his pen, and went down. Upon\r\nentering the room, he found nobody there but the family. The next time\r\nhe met her, he undertook to chide her for having told him a falsehood.\r\nShe denied that she had told a falsehood. \"Didn't you say,\" said he,\r\n\"that there was somebody down stairs that would be glad to see\r\nme?\"—\"Well,\" she replied, with inimitable pertness, \"is not Mrs. Mather\r\nalways glad to see you?\"\r\n\r\nShe even went much farther than this in persecuting the good man while\r\nhe was writing his sermon: she threw large books at his head. But he\r\nstruggled manfully against these buffetings of Satan, as he considered\r\nher conduct to be, finished the sermon, related all these circumstances\r\nin it, preached, and published it. Richard Baxter wrote the preface to\r\nan edition printed in London, in which he declares that he who will not\r\nbe convinced by all the evidence Dr. Mather presents that the child was\r\nbewitched \"must be a very obdurate Sadducee.\" It is so obvious, that,\r\nin this whole affair, Cotton Mather was grossly deceived and\r\naudaciously imposed upon by the most consummate and precocious cunning,\r\nthat it needs no comment. I have given this particular account of it,\r\nbecause there is reason to believe that it originated the delusion in\r\nSalem. It occurred only four years[i.460] before. Dr. Mather's account\r\nof the transaction filled the whole country; and it is probable that\r\nthe children in Mr. Parris's family undertook to re-enact it.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the annals of the histrionic art more illustrative\r\nof the infinite versatility of the human faculties, both physical and\r\nmental, and of the amazing extent to which cunning, ingenuity,\r\ncontrivance, quickness of invention, and presence of mind can be\r\ncultivated, even in very young persons, than such cases as this just\r\nrelated. It seems, at first, incredible that a mere child could carry\r\non such a complex piece of fraud and imposture as that enacted by the\r\nlittle girl whose achievements have been immortalized by the famous\r\nauthor of the \"Magnalia.\" Many other instances, however, are found\r\nrecorded in the history of the delusion we are discussing.\r\n\r\nThat of the grandchild of William and Elizabeth Morse, in Newbury, was\r\nnearly as marvellous, and perfectly successful in deceiving the whole\r\ncountry except Caleb Powell; and he got into much trouble in\r\nconsequence of seeing through it. A similar instance of juvenile\r\nimposture is related as having occurred at Amsterdam in 1560. Twenty or\r\nthirty boys pretended to be suddenly seized with a kind of rage and\r\nfury, were cast upon the ground, and tormented with great agony. These\r\nfits were intermittent; and, when they had passed off, their subjects\r\ndid not seem to be conscious of what had taken place. While they\r\nlasted, the boys threw up, apparently from their stomachs, large\r\nquantities of needles, pins, thimbles, pieces of[i.461] cloth,\r\nfragments of pots and kettles, bits of glass, locks of hair, and a\r\nvariety of other articles. There was no doubt, at the time, that they\r\nwere suffering under the influence of the Devil; and multitudes crowded\r\nround them, and gazed upon them with wonder and horror.\r\n\r\nThe details of the cases in Newbury and Charlestown were dressed up by\r\nCotton Mather and other writers in the strongest colors that credulous\r\nsuperstition and the peculiar views of that age on the subject of\r\ndemonology could employ. They were almost universally received as proof\r\nthat Satan had commenced an onslaught, such as had never before been\r\nknown, upon the Church and the world! They appear to us as simply\r\nabsurd, and the result of precocious knavery; not so to the people of\r\nthat generation. They were looked upon as fearful demonstrations of\r\ndiabolical power, and preludes to the coming of Satan, with his\r\ninfernal confederates, to overwhelm the land. The imaginations of all\r\nwere excited, and their apprehensions morbidly aroused. The very air\r\nwas filled with rumors, fancies, and fears. The ministers sounded the\r\nalarm from their pulpits. The magistrates sharpened the sword of\r\njustice. The deputy-governor of the colony, Danforth, began to arrest\r\nsuspected persons months before proceedings commenced, or were thought\r\nof, in Salem Village. It was believed that evil spirits had been seen,\r\nby men's bodily eyes, in a neighboring town. They glided over the\r\nfields, hovered around the houses, appeared, van[i.462]ished, and\r\nre-appeared on the outskirts of the woods, in the vicinity of\r\nGloucester. Their movements were observed by several of the\r\ninhabitants; and the whole population of the Cape was kept in a state\r\nof agitation and alarm, in consequence of the mysterious phenomena, for\r\nthree weeks. The inhabitants retired to the garrison, and put\r\nthemselves in a state of defence against the diabolical besiegers.\r\nSixty men were despatched from Ipswich, in military array, to\r\nre-enforce the garrison, and several valiant sallies were made from its\r\nwalls. Much powder was expended, but no corporeal or incorporeal blood\r\nwas shed. An account of these events was drawn up by the Rev. John\r\nEmerson, then the minister of the first parish in Gloucester, from\r\nwhich the facts now mentioned have been selected. It is very minute and\r\nparticular. The appearance and dress of the supernatural enemies are\r\ndescribed. They wore white waistcoats, blue shirts, and white breeches,\r\nand had bushy heads of black hair. Mr. Emerson concludes his account by\r\nexpressing the hope that \"all rational persons will be satisfied that\r\nGloucester was not alarmed last summer for above a fortnight together\r\nby real French and Indians, but that the Devil and his agents were the\r\ncause of all the molestation which at this time befell the town.\"\r\n\r\nThese wonderful things took place at Cape Ann, about the time that the\r\ngreat conflict between the Devil and his confederates on the one hand,\r\nand the ministers and magistrates on the other, at Salem Village, was\r\nreaching its height. It is said that it was[i.463] regarded by the most\r\nconsiderate persons, at the time, as an artful contrivance of the Devil\r\nto create a diversion of the attention of the pious colonists from his\r\noperations through the witches in Salem, and, by dividing and\r\ndistracting their forces, to obtain an advantage over them in the war\r\nhe was waging against their churches and their religion.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now ready to enter upon the story of Salem witchcraft. We have\r\nendeavored to become acquainted with the people who acted conspicuous\r\nparts in the drama, and to understand their character; and have tried\r\nto collect, and bring into appreciating view, the opinions and\r\ntheories, the habits of thought, the associations of mind, the\r\npassions, impulses, and fantasies that guided, moulded, and controlled\r\ntheir conduct. The law, literature, and theology of the age, as they\r\nbore on the subject, have been brought before us. The last great\r\ndisplay of the effects of the doctrines of demonology, of the belief of\r\nthe agency of invisible, irresponsible beings, whether fallen angels or\r\ndeparted spirits, upon the actions of men and human affairs, is now to\r\nopen before us. The final results of superstitions and fables and\r\nfancies, accumulating through the ages, are to be exhibited in a\r\ntransaction, an actual demonstration in real life. They are to present\r\nan exemplification that will at once fully display their power, and\r\ndeal their death-blow.\r\n\r\nWithout the least purpose or wish to cover up or extenuate the follies,\r\nexcesses, or outrages I am about[i.464] to describe, into which the\r\ncommunity suffered itself to be led in the witchcraft proceedings of\r\n1692,—with a desire, on the contrary, to make the lesson then given of\r\nthe mischief resulting from misguided enthusiasm, and which will always\r\nresult when popular excitement is allowed to wield the organized powers\r\nof society, as impressive as facts and truth will justify,—I feel bound\r\nto say, in advance, that there are some considerations which we must\r\nkeep before us, while reviewing the incidents of the transaction. The\r\ntheological, legal, and philosophical doctrines and the popular\r\nbeliefs, on which it was founded, have, as I have shown, led, in other\r\ncountries and periods, to similar, and often vastly more shameful,\r\ncruel, and destructive results. But there was something in the affair,\r\nas it was developed here, that has arrested the notice of mankind, and\r\nclothed it with an inherent interest, beyond all other events of the\r\nkind that have elsewhere or ever occurred.\r\n\r\nThe moral force engendered in the civilization planted on these shores,\r\nand pervading the whole body of society, supplied a mightier momentum,\r\nas it does to this day, and ever will, to the movement of the people,\r\nacting in a mass and as a unit, than can anywhere else be found. A\r\npopulation, invigorated by hardy enterprise, and the constant exercise\r\nof all the faculties of freedom, and actuated throughout by individual\r\nenergy of character, must be mightier in motion than any other people.\r\nSuch a population multiplies tenfold its physical forces, by the\r\naddition of[i.465] moral and intellectual energies. The men of the day\r\nand scene we are now to contemplate, however deluded, to whatever\r\nextremities carried, were controlled by fixed, absolute, sharply\r\ndefined, and, in themselves, great ideas. They believed in God. They\r\nalso believed in the Devil. They bowed in an adoration that penetrated\r\ntheir inmost souls, before the one as a being of infinite holiness:\r\nthey regarded the other as a being of an all but infinite power of\r\nevil. They feared and worshipped God. They hated and defied the Devil.\r\nThey believed that Satan was waging war against Jehovah, and that the\r\nconflict was for the dominion of the world, for the establishment or\r\nthe overthrow of the Church of Christ. The battle, they fully believed,\r\ncould have no other issue than the salvation or the ruin of the souls\r\nof men. This was not, with them, a mere technical, verbal creed. It was\r\na deep-seated conviction, held earnestly with a clear and distinct\r\napprehension of its import, by every individual mind. For this warfare,\r\nthey put on the whole armor of faith, rallied to the banner of the Most\r\nHigh, and met Satan face to face. In this one great idea, a stern,\r\ndetermined, unflinching, all-sacrificing people concentrated their\r\nstrength. No wonder that the conflict reached a magnitude which made it\r\nobservable to the whole country and all countries at the time, and will\r\nmake it memorable throughout all time. Those engaged in it, with this\r\nsentiment absorbing their very souls, passed, for the time, out of the\r\nrealm of all other sentiments, and were insensible to all other\r\nconsidera[i.466]tions. The nearer and dearer the relatives, the higher\r\nand more conspicuous the persons, who, in their belief, were in league\r\nwith the Devil, the more profound the abhorrence of their crime, and\r\nthe determination to cut off and destroy them utterly. They believed\r\nthat Satan had, once before, \"against the throne and monarchy of God,\r\nraised impious war and battle proud;\" and that for this he had been\r\ncast out from \"heaven, with all his host of rebel angels;\" that he,\r\nwith his army of subordinate wicked spirits, was making a desperate\r\neffort to retrieve his lost estate, by a renewed rebellion against God;\r\nand they were determined to drive him, and all his confederates, for\r\never from the confines of the earth. The humble hamlet of Salem Village\r\nwas felt to be the great and final battle-ground. However wild and\r\nabsurd this idea is now regarded, it was then sincerely and thoroughly\r\nentertained, and must be taken into the account, in coming to a just\r\nestimate of the character of the transaction, and of those engaged in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOne other thought is to be borne in mind, as we pass through the scenes\r\nthat are to be spread before us. The theology of Christendom, at that\r\ntime, so far as it relates to the power and agency of Satan and\r\ndemonology in general,—and this is the only point of view on which I\r\never refer to theology in this discussion,—and the whole fabric of\r\npopular superstitions founded upon it, had reached their culmination.\r\nThe beginning, middle, and close of the seventeenth century, witnessed\r\nthe greatest display of those supersti[i.467]tions, and prepared the\r\nway for their final explosion. As the hour of their dissolution was at\r\nhand, and they were doomed to vanish before the light of science and\r\neducation, to pass from the realm of supposed reality into that of\r\nacknowledged fiction, it seems to have been ordered that they should\r\nleave monuments behind them, from which their character, elements, and\r\nfeatures, and their terrible influence, might be read and studied in\r\nall subsequent ages.\r\n\r\nThe ideas in reference to the agency and designs of the great enemy of\r\nGod and man, and all his subordinate hosts, witches, fairies, ghosts,\r\n\"gorgons and hydras, and chimeras dire,\" \"apparitions, signs, and\r\nprodigies,\" by which the minds of men had so long been filled, and\r\ntheir fearful imaginations exercised, as they took their flight,\r\nimprinted themselves, for perpetual remembrance, in productions which,\r\nmore than any works of mere human genius, are sure to live for ever.\r\nThey left their forms crystallized, with imperishable lineaments, in\r\nthe greatest of dramas and the greatest of epics. The plays of\r\nShakespeare, as the century opened, and the verse of Milton in its\r\ncentral period, are their record and their picture.\r\n\r\nBut there was another shape and aspect in which it was pre-eminently\r\nimportant to have their memory preserved; and that was their\r\napplication to life, their influence upon the conduct of men, the\r\naction of tribunals, and the movements of society, and, in general,\r\ntheir effects, when allowed full operation, upon human happiness and\r\nwelfare. This want was supplied, as[i.468] the century terminated, by\r\nthe tragedy in real life, whose scenes are now to be presented in\r\nWitchcraft at Salem Village.\r\n\r\nHowever strange it seems, it is quite worthy of observation, that the\r\nactors in that tragedy, the \"afflicted children,\" and other witnesses,\r\nin their various statements and operations, embraced about the whole\r\ncircle of popular superstition. How those young country girls, some of\r\nthem mere children, most of them wholly illiterate, could have become\r\nfamiliar with such fancies, to such an extent, is truly surprising.\r\nThey acted out, and brought to bear with tremendous effect, almost all\r\nthat can be found in the literature of that day, and the period\r\npreceding it, relating to such subjects. Images and visions which had\r\nbeen portrayed in tales of romance, and given interest to the pages of\r\npoetry, will be made by them, as we shall see, to throng the woods,\r\nflit through the air, and hover over the heads of a terrified court.\r\nThe ghosts of murdered wives and children will play their parts with a\r\nvividness of representation and artistic skill of expression that have\r\nhardly been surpassed in scenic representations on the stage. In the\r\nSalem-witchcraft proceedings, the superstition of the middle ages was\r\nembodied in real action. All its extravagances, absurdities, and\r\nmonstrosities appear in their application to human experience. We see\r\nwhat the effect has been, and must be, when the affairs of life, in\r\ncourts of law and the relations of society, or the conduct or feelings\r\nof individuals, are suffered to[i.469] be under the control of fanciful\r\nor mystical notions. When a whole people abandons the solid ground of\r\ncommon sense, overleaps the boundaries of human knowledge, gives itself\r\nup to wild reveries, and lets loose its passions without restraint, it\r\npresents a spectacle more terrific to behold, and becomes more\r\ndestructive and disastrous, than any convulsion of mere material\r\nnature; than tornado, conflagration, or earthquake.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL. I.\r\n\r\nGo to Volume II\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[A] Not only the storms of two hundred and thirty years, but the bolts\r\nof heaven, have beat in vain upon this mansion. The view given of it in\r\nthe frontispiece is from a sketch taken in winter. The leafless\r\nbranches of a tall elm at its western end are represented. At noon on\r\nSaturday, July 28, 1866, during a violent thunder-storm, the electric\r\nfluid seems to have passed down the tree, rending and tearing some of\r\nits branches, and leaving its traces on the trunk. It flashed into the\r\nhouse. It tore the roof, knocking away one corner, displacing in\r\npatches the mortar that coated the old chimney top and sides, hacking\r\nthe edges of the brick-work, splitting off the side of an extension to\r\nthe building at the western end, entering a chamber at that point,\r\nwhere two children were sitting at a window, and throwing upon the\r\nfloor, within two or three feet of them, a considerable portion of the\r\nplastered ceiling. It then scattered all through the apartments. What\r\nlooked like perforations, as if made by shot or pistol-balls, were\r\nfound in many places; but there were no corresponding marks on the\r\nopposite sides of the walls or partitions. Portions of the\r\npaper-hangings were stripped off, and small slivers ripped up from the\r\nfloors. It struck the frames of looking-glasses, cracking off small\r\npieces of the wood, but only in one instance breaking the mirror. It\r\ncut a velvet band by which one was hung; and it was found on the floor,\r\nthe mirror downward and unbroken, as if it had been carefully laid\r\nthere. In the attic, fragments of the old gnarled and knotted rafters,\r\nof different lengths,—from four or five feet to mere chips,—were\r\nscattered in quantities upon the floor, and grooves made lengthwise\r\nalong posts and implements of household use. Large cracks were left in\r\nthe wooden casings of some of the doors and windows. A family of eight\r\npersons were seated around the dinner-table. All were more or less\r\naffected. They were deprived for the time of the use of their feet and\r\nancles; were stunned, paralyzed, and rendered insensible for a few\r\nmoments by the shock; and felt the effects, some of them, for a day or\r\ntwo in their lower limbs. In front of each person at the table was a\r\ntall goblet, which had just been filled with water. As soon as they\r\nwere able to notice, they found the water dripping on all sides to the\r\nfloor, the whole table-cloth wet, seven of the goblets entirely empty,\r\nthe eighth half emptied, and not one of them thrown over, or in the\r\nslightest manner displaced. The whole house was filled with what\r\nseemed, to the sight and smell, to be smoke; but no combustion, scorch,\r\ndiscoloration, or the least indication of heat, could be found on any\r\nof the objects struck. The building, in its thirteen rooms, from the\r\ngarret to the ground-floor, had been flooded with lightning; but, with\r\nall its inmates, escaped without considerable or permanent injury.\r\n\r\n[B] For a thorough discussion of the several Hebrew words that relate\r\nto Divination and Magic, see Wierus de Præstigiis, L. 2, c. 1.\r\n\r\n[C] The syllogism was originally designed to serve as a _method of\r\ndetermining the arrangement and classification of truth already shown_;\r\nand, when employed for this purpose, was of great value and excellence.\r\nIt was its perverted application to the _discovery_ of truth which\r\nrendered utterly worthless so large a part of the learning and\r\nphilosophy of the middle ages. The reader will perceive, that it is to\r\nthe syllogism, as thus misapplied and misunderstood by the schoolmen,\r\nnot as designed and used by Aristotle, that the remarks in the text are\r\nintended to apply.\r\n\r\n[D] The manner in which Dr. Mather brings forward this affair shows how\r\nloose and inaccurate he was in his description of events. It also\r\nillustrates the tendency of the times to exaggerate, or to paint in the\r\nhighest colors, whatever was susceptible of being represented as\r\nmiraculous. There is no reason, however, to doubt that the facts took\r\nplace substantially as described in the text. The reader is referred,\r\non this as on all points connected with our early history, to Mr.\r\nSavage's instructive, elaborate, and entertaining edition of Winthrop's\r\n\"New England.\"\r\n\r\n[E] It is much to be regretted, that Farmer, after having written with\r\nsuch admirable success upon the temptation, the demoniacs, miracles,\r\nand the worship of human spirits, did not live to accomplish his\r\noriginal design, by giving the world a complete discussion and\r\nelucidation of the Scripture doctrine of the Devil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Philip English House\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHILIP ENGLISH HOUSE.—Vol. II., 142.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ii.1]\r\n Witch Hill. 1866.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THIRD.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITCHCRAFT AT SALEM VILLAGE.\r\n\r\nW E left Mr. Parris in the early part of November, 1691, at the crisis\r\nof his controversy with the inhabitants of Salem Village, under\r\ncircumstances which seemed to indicate that its termination was near at\r\nhand. The opposition to him had assumed a form which made it quite\r\nprobable that it would succeed in dislodging him from his position. But\r\nthe end was not yet. Events were ripening that were to give him a new\r\nand fearful strength, and open a scene in which he was to act a part\r\ndestined to attract the notice of the world, and become a permanent\r\nportion of human history. The doctrines of demonology had produced\r\ntheir full effect upon the minds of men, and every thing was ready for\r\na final display of their power. The story of the Goodwin children, as\r\ntold by Cotton Mather, was known and read in all the dwellings of the\r\nland, and filled the imaginations of a credulous age.\r\n[ii.2]Deputy-governor Danforth had begun the work of arrests; and\r\npersons charged with witchcraft, belonging to neighboring towns, were\r\nalready in prison.\r\n\r\nMr. Parris appears to have had in his family several slaves, probably\r\nbrought by him from the West Indies. One of them, whom he calls, in his\r\nchurch-record book, \"my negro lad,\" had died, a year or two before, at\r\nthe age of nineteen. Two of them were man and wife. The former was\r\nalways known by the name of \"John Indian;\" the latter was called\r\n\"Tituba.\" These two persons may have originated the \"Salem witchcraft.\"\r\nThey are spoken of as having come from New Spain, as it was then\r\ncalled,—that is, the Spanish West Indies, and the adjacent mainlands of\r\nCentral and South America,—and, in all probability, contributed, from\r\nthe wild and strange superstitions prevalent among their native tribes,\r\nmaterials which, added to the commonly received notions on such\r\nsubjects, heightened the infatuation of the times, and inflamed still\r\nmore the imaginations of the credulous. Persons conversant with the\r\nIndians of Mexico, and on both sides of the Isthmus, discern many\r\nsimilarities in their systems of demonology with ideas and practices\r\ndeveloped here.\r\n\r\nMr. Parris's former residence in the neighborhood of the Spanish Main,\r\nand the prominent part taken by his Indian slaves in originating the\r\nproceedings at the village, may account for some of the features of the\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1691 and 1692, a circle of young girls had been\r\nformed, who were in the habit of meeting at Mr. Parris's house for the\r\n[ii.3]purpose of practising palmistry, and other arts of\r\nfortune-telling, and of becoming experts in the wonders of necromancy,\r\nmagic, and spiritualism. It consisted, besides the Indian servants,\r\nmainly of the following persons:—\r\n\r\nElizabeth, daughter of Mr. Parris, was nine years of age. She seems to\r\nhave performed a leading part in the first stages of the affair, and\r\nmust have been a child of remarkable precocity. It is a noticeable\r\nfact, that her father early removed her from the scene. She was sent to\r\nthe town, where she remained in the family of Stephen Sewall, until the\r\nproceedings at the village were brought to a close. Abigail Williams, a\r\nniece of Mr. Parris, and a member of his household, was eleven years of\r\nage. She acted conspicuously in the witchcraft prosecutions from\r\nbeginning to end. Ann Putnam, daughter of Sergeant Thomas Putnam, the\r\nparish clerk or recorder, was twelve years of age. The character and\r\nsocial position of her parents gave her a prominence which an\r\nextraordinary development of the imaginative faculty, and of mental\r\npowers generally, enabled her to hold throughout. This young girl is\r\nperhaps entitled to be regarded as, in many respects, the leading agent\r\nin all the mischief that followed. Mary Walcot was seventeen years of\r\nage. Her father was Jonathan Walcot (vol. i. p. 225). His first wife,\r\nMary Sibley, to whom he was married in 1664, had died in 1683. She was\r\nthe mother of Mary. It is a singular fact, and indicates the estimation\r\nin which Captain Walcot was held, that, although not a church-member,\r\nhe filled the office of deacon of the parish[ii.4] for several years\r\nbefore the formation of the church. Mercy Lewis was also seventeen\r\nyears of age. When quite young, she was, for a time, in the family of\r\nthe Rev. George Burroughs: and, in 1692, was living as a servant in the\r\nfamily of Thomas Putnam; although, occasionally, she seems to have\r\nlived, in the same capacity, with that of John Putnam, Jr., the\r\nconstable of the village. He was a son of Nathaniel, and resided in the\r\nneighborhood of Thomas and Deacon Edward Putnam. Mercy Lewis performed\r\na leading part in the proceedings, had great energy of purpose and\r\ncapacity of management, and became responsible for much of the crime\r\nand horror connected with them. Elizabeth Hubbard, seventeen years of\r\nage, who also occupies a bad eminence in the scene, was a niece of Mrs.\r\nDr. Griggs, and lived in her family. Elizabeth Booth and Susannah\r\nSheldon, each eighteen years of age, belonged to families in the\r\nneighborhood. Mary Warren, twenty years of age, was a servant in the\r\nfamily of John Procter; and Sarah Churchill, of the same age, was a\r\nservant in that of George Jacobs, Sr. These two last were actuated, it\r\nis too apparent, by malicious feelings towards the families in which\r\nthey resided, and contributed largely to the horrible tragedy. The\r\nfacts to be exhibited will enable every one who carefully considers\r\nthem, to form an estimate, for himself, of the respective character and\r\nconduct of these young persons. It is almost beyond belief that they\r\nwere wholly actuated by deliberate and cold-blooded malignity. Their\r\ncrime would, in that view, have been[ii.5] without a parallel in\r\nmonstrosity of wickedness, and beyond what can be imagined of the\r\nguiltiest and most depraved natures. For myself, I am unable to\r\ndetermine how much may be attributed to credulity, hallucination, and\r\nthe delirium of excitement, or to deliberate malice and falsehood.\r\nThere is too much evidence of guile and conspiracy to attribute all\r\ntheir actions and declarations to delusion; and their conduct\r\nthroughout was stamped with a bold assurance and audacious bearing.\r\nWith one or two slight and momentary exceptions, there was a total\r\nabsence of compunction or commiseration, and a reckless disregard of\r\nthe agonies and destruction they were scattering around them. They\r\npresent a subject that justly claims, and will for ever task, the\r\nexamination of those who are most competent to fathom the mysteries of\r\nthe human soul, sound its depths, and measure the extent to which it is\r\nliable to become wicked and devilish. It will be seen that other\r\npersons were drawn to act with these \"afflicted children,\" as they were\r\ncalled, some from contagious delusion, and some, as was quite well\r\nproved, from a false, mischievous, and malignant spirit.\r\n\r\nBesides the above-mentioned persons, there were three married women,\r\nrather under middle life, who acted with the afflicted children,—Mrs.\r\nAnn Putnam, the mother of the child of that name; Mrs. Pope; and a\r\nwoman, named Bibber, who appears to have lived at Wenham. Another\r\nmarried woman,—spoken of as \"ancient,\"—named Goodell, had also been in\r\nthe[ii.6] habit of attending their meetings; but she is not named in\r\nany of the documents on file, and was probably withdrawn, at an early\r\nperiod, from participating in the transaction.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the winter, they became quite skilful and expert in\r\nthe arts they were learning, and gradually began to display their\r\nattainments to the admiration and amazement of beholders. At first,\r\nthey made no charges against any person, but confined themselves to\r\nstrange actions, exclamations, and contortions. They would creep into\r\nholes, and under benches and chairs, put themselves into odd and\r\nunnatural postures, make wild and antic gestures, and utter incoherent\r\nand unintelligible sounds. They would be seized with spasms, drop\r\ninsensible to the floor, or writhe in agony, suffering dreadful\r\ntortures, and uttering loud and piercing outcries. The attention of the\r\nfamilies in which they held their meetings was called to their\r\nextraordinary condition and proceedings; and the whole neighborhood and\r\nsurrounding country soon were filled with the story of the strange and\r\nunaccountable sufferings of the \"afflicted girls.\" No explanation could\r\nbe given, and their condition became worse and worse. The physician of\r\nthe village, Dr. Griggs, was called in, a consultation had, and the\r\nopinion finally and gravely given, that the afflicted children were\r\nbewitched. It was quite common in those days for the faculty to dispose\r\nof difficult cases by this resort. When their remedies were baffled,\r\nand their skill at fault, the patient was[ii.7] said to be \"under an\r\nevil hand.\" In all cases, the sage conclusion was received by nurses,\r\nand elderly women called in on such occasions, if the symptoms were out\r\nof the common course, or did not yield to the prescriptions these\r\npersons were in the habit of applying. Very soon, the whole community\r\nbecame excited and alarmed to the highest degree. All other topics were\r\nforgotten. The only thing spoken or thought of was the terrible\r\ncondition of the afflicted children in Mr. Parris's house, or wherever,\r\nfrom time to time, the girls assembled. They were the objects of\r\nuniversal compassion and wonder. The people flocked from all quarters\r\nto witness their sufferings, and gaze with awe upon their convulsions.\r\nBecoming objects of such notice, they were stimulated to vary and\r\nexpand the manifestations of the extraordinary influence that was upon\r\nthem. They extended their operations beyond the houses of Mr. Parris,\r\nand the families to which they belonged, to public places; and their\r\nfits, exclamations, and outcries disturbed the exercises of prayer\r\nmeetings, and the ordinary services of the congregation. On one\r\noccasion, on the Lord's Day, March 20th, when the singing of the psalm\r\nprevious to the sermon was concluded, before the person preaching—Mr.\r\nLawson—could come forward, Abigail Williams cried out, \"Now stand up,\r\nand name your text.\" When he had read it, in a loud and insolent voice\r\nshe exclaimed, \"It's a long text.\" In the midst of the discourse, Mrs.\r\nPope broke in, \"Now, there is enough of that.\" In the afternoon of the\r\nsame day, while re[ii.8]ferring to the doctrine he had been expounding\r\nin the preceding service, Abigail Williams rudely ejaculated, \"I know\r\nno doctrine you had. If you did name one, I have forgot it.\" An aged\r\nmember of the church was present, against whom a warrant on the charge\r\nof witchcraft had been procured the day before. Being apprised of the\r\nproceeding, Abigail Williams spoke aloud, during the service, calling\r\nby name the person about to be apprehended, \"Look where she sits upon\r\nthe beam, sucking her yellow-bird betwixt her fingers.\" Ann Putnam,\r\njoining in, exclaimed, \"There is a yellow-bird sitting on the\r\nminister's hat, as it hangs on the pin in the pulpit.\" Mr. Lawson\r\nremarks, with much simplicity, that these things, occurring \"in the\r\ntime of public worship, did something interrupt me in my first prayer,\r\nbeing so unusual.\" But he braced himself up to the emergency, and went\r\non with the service. There is no intimation that Mr. Parris rebuked his\r\nniece for her disorderly behavior. As at several other times, the\r\npeople sitting near Ann Putnam had to lay hold of her to prevent her\r\nproceeding to greater extremities, and wholly breaking up the meeting.\r\nThe girls were supposed to be under an irresistible and supernatural\r\nimpulse; and, instead of being severely punished, were looked upon with\r\nmingled pity, terror, and awe, and made objects of the greatest\r\nattention. Of course, where members of the minister's family were\r\ncountenanced in such proceedings, during the exercises of public\r\nworship, on the Lord's Day, in the meeting-house, it was not[ii.9]\r\nstrange that people in general yielded to the excitement. But all did\r\nnot. Several members of the family of Francis Nurse, Peter Cloyse and\r\nwife, and Joseph Putnam, expressed their disapprobation of such doings\r\nbeing allowed, and absented themselves from meeting. Perhaps others\r\ntook the same course; but whoever did were marked, as the sequel will\r\nshow.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while the excitement was worked up to the highest pitch.\r\nThe families to which several of the \"afflicted children\" belonged were\r\nled to apply themselves to fasting and prayer, on which occasions the\r\nneighbors, under the guidance of the minister, would assemble, and\r\nunite in invocations to the Divine Being to interpose and deliver them\r\nfrom the snares and dominion of Satan. The \"afflicted children\" who\r\nmight be present would not, as a general thing, interrupt the prayers\r\nwhile in progress, but would break out with their wild outcries and\r\nconvulsive spasms in the intervals of the service. In due time, Mr.\r\nParris sent for the neighboring ministers to assemble at his house, and\r\nunite with him in devoting a day to solemn religious services and\r\nearnest supplications to the throne of Mercy for rescue from the power\r\nof the great enemy of souls. The ministers spent the day in Mr.\r\nParris's house, and the children performed their feats before their\r\neyes. The reverend gentlemen were astounded at what they saw, fully\r\ncorroborated the opinion of Dr. Griggs, and formally declared their\r\nbelief that the Evil One had commenced his operations with a bolder\r\nfront and[ii.10] on a broader scale than ever before in this or any\r\nother country.\r\n\r\nThis judgment of the ministers was quickly made known everywhere; and,\r\nif doubt remained in any mind, it was suppressed by the irresistible\r\npower of an overwhelming public conviction. Individuals were lost in\r\nthe universal fanaticism. Society was dissolved into a wild and excited\r\ncrowd. Men and women left their fields, their houses, their labors and\r\nemployments, to witness the awful unveiling of the demoniac power, and\r\nto behold the workings of Satan himself upon the victims of his wrath.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind, that it was then an established doctrine in\r\ntheology, philosophy, and law, that the Devil could not operate upon\r\nmortals, or mortal affairs, except through the intermediate\r\ninstrumentality of human beings in confederacy with him, that is,\r\nwitches or wizards. The question, of course, in all minds and on all\r\ntongues, was, \"Who are the agents of the Devil in afflicting these\r\ngirls? There must be some among us thus acting, and who are they?\" For\r\nsome time the girls held back from mentioning names; or, if they did,\r\nit was prevented from being divulged to the public. In the mean time,\r\nthe excitement spread and deepened. At length the people had become so\r\nthoroughly prepared for the work, that it was concluded to begin\r\noperations in earnest. The continued pressure upon the \"afflicted\r\nchildren,\" the earnest and importunate inquiry, on all sides, \"Who is\r\nit that bewitches you?\" opened their lips in response, and[ii.11] they\r\nbegan to select and bring forward their victims. One after another,\r\nthey cried out \"Good,\" \"Osburn,\" \"Tituba.\" On the 29th of February,\r\n1692, warrants were duly issued against those persons. It is\r\nobservable, that the complainants who procured the warrants in these\r\ncases were Joseph Hutchinson, Edward Putnam, Thomas Putnam, and Thomas\r\nPreston. This fact shows how nearly unanimous, at this time, was the\r\nconviction that the sufferings of the girls were the result of\r\nwitchcraft. Joseph Hutchinson was a firm-minded man, of strong common\r\nsense, and from his general character and ways of thinking and acting,\r\none of the last persons liable to be carried away by a popular\r\nenthusiasm, and was found among the earliest rescued from it. Thomas\r\nPreston was a son-in-law of Francis Nurse.\r\n\r\nAs all was ripe for the development of the plot, extraordinary means\r\nwere taken to give publicity, notoriety, and effect to the first\r\nexaminations. On the 1st of March the two leading magistrates of the\r\nneighborhood, men of great note and influence, whose fathers had been\r\namong the chief founders of the settlement, and who were\r\nAssistants,—that is, members of the highest legislative and judicial\r\nbody in the colony, combining with the functions of a senate those of a\r\ncourt of last resort with most comprehensive jurisdiction,—John\r\nHathorne and Jonathan Corwin, entered the village, in imposing array,\r\nescorted by the marshal, constables, and their aids, with all the\r\ntrappings of their offices; reined up at Nathaniel In[ii.12]gersoll's\r\ncorner, and dismounted at his door. The whole population of the\r\nneighborhood, apprised of the occasion, was gathered on the lawn, or\r\ncame flocking along the roads. The crowd was so great that it was\r\nnecessary to adjourn to the meeting-house, which was filled at once by\r\na multitude excited to the highest pitch of indignation and abhorrence\r\ntowards the prisoners, and of curiosity to witness the novel and\r\nimposing spectacle and proceedings. The magistrates took seats in front\r\nof the pulpit, facing the assembly; a long table or raised platform\r\nbeing placed before them; and it was announced, that they were ready to\r\nenter upon the examination. On bringing in and delivering over the\r\naccused parties, the officers who had executed the warrants stated that\r\nthey \"had made diligent search for images and such like, but could find\r\nnone.\" After prayer, Constable George Locker produced the body of Sarah\r\nGood; and Constable Joseph Herrick, the bodies of Sarah Osburn, and\r\nTituba Mr. Parris's Indian woman. The evidence seems to indicate, that,\r\non these occasions, the prisoners were placed on the platform, to keep\r\nthem from the contact of the general crowd, and that all might see\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSarah Good was first examined, the other two being removed from the\r\nhouse for the time. In complaining of her, and bringing her forward\r\nfirst, the prosecutors showed that they were well advised. There was a\r\ngeneral readiness to receive the charge against her, as she was\r\nevidently the object of much prejudice in the neighborhood. Her\r\nhusband, who was a weak,[ii.13] ignorant, and dependent person, had\r\nbecome alienated from her. The family were very poor; and she and her\r\nchildren had sometimes been without a house to shelter them, and left\r\nto wander from door to door for relief. Whether justly or not, she\r\nappears to have been subject to general obloquy. Probably there was no\r\none in the country around, against whom popular suspicion could have\r\nbeen more readily directed, or in whose favor and defence less interest\r\ncould be awakened. She was a forlorn, friendless, and forsaken\r\ncreature, broken down by wretchedness of condition and ill-repute. The\r\nfollowing are the minutes of her examination, as found among the\r\nfiles:—\r\n\r\n\"_The Examination of Sarah Good before the Worshipful Esqrs. John\r\nHathorne and Jonathan Corwin._\r\n\r\n\"Sarah Good, what evil spirit have you familiarity with?—None.\r\n\r\n\"Have you made no contracts with the Devil?—No.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you hurt these children?—I do not hurt them. I scorn it.\r\n\r\n\"Who do you employ then to do it?—I employ nobody.\r\n\r\n\"What creature do you employ then?—No creature: but I am falsely\r\naccused.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you go away muttering from Mr. Parris his house?—I did not\r\nmutter, but I thanked him for what he gave my child.\r\n\r\n\"Have you made no contract with the Devil?—No.\r\n\r\n\"Hathorne desired the children all of them to look upon her, and see if\r\nthis were the person that hurt them; and so they all did look upon her,\r\nand said this was one of the persons that did torment them. Presently\r\nthey were all tormented.[ii.14]\r\n\r\n\"Sarah Good, do you not see now what you have done? Why do you not tell\r\nus the truth? Why do you thus torment these poor children?—I do not\r\ntorment them.\r\n\r\n\"Who do you employ then?—I employ nobody. I scorn it.\r\n\r\n\"How came they thus tormented?—What do I know? You bring others here,\r\nand now you charge me with it.\r\n\r\n\"Why, who was it?—I do not know but it was some you brought into the\r\nmeeting-house with you.\r\n\r\n\"We brought you into the meeting-house.—But you brought in two more.\r\n\r\n\"Who was it, then, that tormented the children?—It was Osburn.\r\n\r\n\"What is it you say when you go muttering away from persons' houses?—If\r\nI must tell, I will tell.\r\n\r\n\"Do tell us then.—If I must tell, I will tell: it is the Commandments.\r\nI may say my Commandments, I hope.\r\n\r\n\"What Commandment is it?—If I must tell you, I will tell: it is a\r\npsalm.\r\n\r\n\"What psalm?\r\n\r\n\"(After a long time she muttered over some part of a psalm.)\r\n\r\n\"Who do you serve?—I serve God.\r\n\r\n\"What God do you serve?—The God that made heaven and earth (though she\r\nwas not willing to mention the word 'God'). Her answers were in a very\r\nwicked, spiteful manner, reflecting and retorting against the authority\r\nwith base and abusive words; and many lies she was taken in. It was\r\nhere said that her husband had said that he was afraid that she either\r\nwas a witch or would be one very quickly. The worshipful Mr. Hathorne,\r\nasked him his reason why he[ii.15] said so of her, whether he had ever\r\nseen any thing by her. He answered 'No, not in this nature; but it was\r\nher bad carriage to him: and indeed,' said he, 'I may say with tears,\r\nthat she is an enemy to all good.'\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is in the handwriting of Ezekiel Cheever. The following\r\nis in that of John Hathorne:—\r\n\r\n\"Salem Village, March the 1st, 1692.—Sarah Good, upon examination,\r\ndenied the matter of fact (viz.) that she ever used any witchcraft, or\r\nhurt the abovesaid children, or any of them.\r\n\r\n\"The abovenamed children, being all present, positively accused her of\r\nhurting of them sundry times within this two months, and also that\r\nmorning. Sarah Good denied that she had been at their houses in said\r\ntime or near them, or had done them any hurt. All the abovesaid\r\nchildren then present accused her face to face; upon which they were\r\nall dreadfully tortured and tormented for a short space of time; and,\r\nthe affliction and tortures being over, they charged said Sarah Good\r\nagain that she had then so tortured them, and came to them and did it,\r\nalthough she was personally then kept at a considerable distance from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Sarah Good being asked if that she did not then hurt them, who did it;\r\nand the children being again tortured, she looked upon them, and said\r\nthat it was one of them we brought into the house with us. We asked her\r\nwho it was: she then answered, and said it was Sarah Osburn, and Sarah\r\nOsburn was then under custody, and not in the house; and the children,\r\nbeing quickly after recovered out of their fit, said that it was Sarah\r\nGood and also Sarah Osburn that then did hurt and torment or afflict\r\nthem, although both of them at the same time at a distance[ii.16] or\r\nremote from them personally. There were also sundry other questions put\r\nto her, and answers given thereunto by her according as is also given\r\nin.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the examination was conducted in the form of\r\nquestions put by the magistrate, Hathorne, based upon a foregone\r\nconclusion of the prisoner's guilt, and expressive of a conviction, all\r\nalong on his part, that the evidence of \"the afflicted\" against her\r\namounted to, and was, absolute demonstration. It will also be noticed,\r\nthat, severe as was the opinion of her husband in reference to her\r\ngeneral conduct, he could not be made to say that he had ever noticed\r\nany thing in her of the nature of witchcraft. The torments the girls\r\naffected to experience in looking at her must have produced an\r\noverwhelming effect on the crowd, as they did on the magistrate, and\r\neven on the poor, amazed creature herself. She did not seem to doubt\r\nthe reality of their sufferings. In this, and in all cases, it must be\r\nremembered that the account of the examination comes to us from those\r\nwho were under the wildest excitement against the prisoners; that no\r\ncounsel was allowed them; that, if any thing was suffered to be said in\r\ntheir defence by others, it has failed to reach us; that the accused\r\npersons were wholly unaccustomed to such scenes and exposures,\r\nunsuspicious of the perils of a cross-examination, or of an inquisition\r\nconducted with a design to entrap and ensnare; and that what they did\r\nsay was liable to be misunderstood, as well as misrepresented. We\r\ncannot hear their story. All we know is from parties[ii.17] prejudiced,\r\nto the highest degree, against them. Sarah Good was an unfortunate and\r\nmiserable woman in her circumstances and condition: but, from all that\r\nappears on the record, making due allowance for the credulity,\r\nextravagance, prejudice, folly, or malignity of the witnesses; giving\r\nfull effect to every thing that can claim the character of substantial\r\nforce alleged against her, it is undeniable, that there was not, beyond\r\nthe afflicted girls, a particle of evidence to sustain the charge on\r\nwhich she was arraigned; and that, in the worst aspect of her case, she\r\nwas an object for compassion, rather than punishment. Altogether, the\r\nproceedings against her, which terminated with her execution, were\r\ncruel and shameful to the highest degree.\r\n\r\nOn the conclusion of her examination, she was removed from the\r\nmeeting-house, and Sarah Osburn brought in. Her selection, as one of\r\nthe persons to be first cried out upon, was judicious. The public mind\r\nwas prepared to believe the charge against her. Her original name was\r\nSarah Warren. She was married, April 5, 1662, to Robert Prince, who\r\nbelonged to a leading family, and owned a valuable farm. He died early,\r\nleaving her with two young children, James and Joseph.\r\n\r\nIn the early colonial period, it was the custom for persons who desired\r\nto come from the old country to America, but had not the means to\r\ndefray the expenses of the passage, to let or sell themselves, for a\r\ngreater or less length of time, to individuals residing here who needed\r\ntheir service. The practice continued[ii.18] down to the present\r\ncentury. Emigrants who thus sold themselves for a period of years were\r\ncalled \"redemptioners.\" Alexander Osburn came over from Ireland in this\r\ncharacter. The widow of Robert Prince bought out the residue of his\r\ntime from the person to whom he was thus under contract, for fifteen\r\npounds, and employed him to carry on her farm. After a while, she\r\nmarried him. This, it is probable, gave rise to some criticism; and, as\r\nher boys grew up, became more and more disagreeable to them. The\r\nmarriage, as was natural, led to unhappy results. In 1720, after Osburn\r\nhad been dead some years, a curious case was brought into court, in\r\nwhich the sons of Robert Prince testified that Osburn treated their\r\nmother and them with great cruelty and barbarity. They had become of\r\nage before their mother's death, and had signed their names to a deed\r\nconveying away land belonging to their patrimony. The object of the\r\nsuit was to invalidate the conveyance by proving that they were\r\ncompelled by Osburn to sign the deed, he using threats and violence\r\nupon them at the time. There was an extraordinary conflict of testimony\r\nin the trial; some witnesses strongly corroborating the accusations of\r\nthe Princes, and some equally strong in vindication of the character of\r\nOsburn. It was shown, that, in the opinion of several of his neighbors,\r\nhe was an industrious, respectable, and worthy person. It is difficult\r\nto determine the precise merits of the case. After the death of his\r\nwife, Osburn married Ruth, a daughter of William Cantlebury, and widow\r\nof William Sibley.[ii.19] She was a woman of unquestioned excellence of\r\ncharacter, and of a large landed estate. Osburn was her third husband,\r\nthe first having been Thomas Small. After her marriage to Osburn, he\r\nand she joined the church, and were reputable persons in all respects.\r\nHe was well regarded as a citizen, and often on the parish committee.\r\nNeither he nor the widow Sibley appear to have been implicated in the\r\nwitchcraft proceedings in any other particular than that he testified\r\nthat his then wife Sarah had not been for some time at meeting. There\r\nis no indication that this was volunteer testimony. He and his wife\r\nRuth were among the firmest opponents of Mr. Parris. There is no\r\nmention of his having had children by either of his American wives. His\r\nson John, who probably came with him to the country, was an inhabitant\r\nof the Village; and his name is on the rate-list, for the last time, in\r\n1718, his father having died some years before. The Osborne family, in\r\nthis part of the country, does not appear to have sprung from this\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to decide where, or in what proportions, the blame\r\nis to be laid, the fact is evident, that the marriage of the widow\r\nSarah Prince to Alexander Osburn was an unhappy one. Her mind became\r\ndepressed, if not distracted. For some time, she had been bedridden. Of\r\ncourse, as she had occupied a respectable social position, and was a\r\nwoman of property, her case naturally gave rise to scandal. Rumor was\r\nbusy and gossip rife in reference to her; and it was quite natural that\r\nshe should have been suggested[ii.20] for the accusing girls to pitch\r\nupon. The following is an account of her examination by the\r\nmagistrates, in the handwriting of John Hathorne:—\r\n\r\n\"Sarah Osburne, upon examination, denied the matter of fact, viz., that\r\nshe ever understood or used any witchcraft, or hurt any of the\r\nabovesaid children.\r\n\r\n\"The children above named, being all personally present, accused her\r\nface to face; which, being done, they were all hurt, afflicted, and\r\ntortured very much; which, being over, and they out of their fits, they\r\nsaid that said Sarah Osburne did then come to them, and hurt them,\r\nSarah Osburne being then kept at a distance personally from them. Sarah\r\nOsburne was asked why she then hurt them. She denied it. It being asked\r\nof her how she could so pinch and hurt them, and yet she be at that\r\ndistance personally from them, she answered she did not then hurt them,\r\nnor ever did. She was asked who, then, did it, or who she employed to\r\ndo it. She answered she did not know that the Devil goes about in her\r\nlikeness to do any hurt. Sarah Osburne, being told that Sarah Good, one\r\nof her companions, had, upon examination, accused her, she,\r\nnotwithstanding, denied the same, according to her examination, which\r\nis more at large given in, as therein will appear.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is in the handwriting of Ezekiel Cheever:—\r\n\r\n\"_Sarah Osburn her Examination._\r\n\r\n\"What evil spirit have you familiarity with?—None.\r\n\r\n\"Have you made no contract with the Devil?—No: I never saw the Devil in\r\nmy life.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you hurt these children?—I do not hurt them.[ii.21]\r\n\r\n\"Who do you employ, then, to hurt them?—I employ nobody.\r\n\r\n\"What familiarity have you with Sarah Good?—None: I have not seen her\r\nthese two years.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you see her then?—One day, agoing to town.\r\n\r\n\"What communications had you with her?—I had none, only 'How do you\r\ndo?' or so. I do not know her by name.\r\n\r\n\"What did you call her, then?\r\n\r\n\"(Osburn made a stand at that; at last, said she called her Sarah.)\r\n\r\n\"Sarah Good saith that it was you that hurt the children.—I do not know\r\nthat the Devil goes about in my likeness to do any hurt.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hathorne desired all the children to stand up, and look upon her,\r\nand see if they did know her, which they all did; and every one of them\r\nsaid that this was one of the women that did afflict them, and that\r\nthey had constantly seen her in the very habit that she was now in.\r\nThree evidences declared that she said this morning, that she was more\r\nlike to be bewitched than that she was a witch. Mr. Hathorne asked her\r\nwhat made her say so. She answered that she was frighted one time in\r\nher sleep, and either saw, or dreamed that she saw, a thing like an\r\nIndian all black, which did pinch her in her neck, and pulled her by\r\nthe back part of her head to the door of the house.\r\n\r\n\"Did you never see any thing else?—No.\r\n\r\n\"(It was said by some in the meeting-house, that she had said that she\r\nwould never believe that lying spirit any more.)\r\n\r\n\"What lying spirit is this? Hath the Devil ever deceived you, and been\r\nfalse to you?—I do not know the Devil. I never did see him.[ii.22]\r\n\r\n\"What lying spirit was it, then?—It was a voice that I thought I heard.\r\n\r\n\"What did it propound to you?—That I should go no more to meeting; but\r\nI said I would, and did go the next sabbath-day.\r\n\r\n\"Were you never tempted further?—No.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you yield thus far to the Devil as never to go to meeting\r\nsince?—Alas! I have been sick, and not able to go.\r\n\r\n\"Her husband and others said that she had not been at meeting three\r\nyears and two months.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing illustrates the unfairness practised by the examining\r\nmagistrate. He took for granted, as we shall find to have been the case\r\nin all instances, the guilt of the prisoner, and endeavored to entangle\r\nher by leading questions, thus involving her in contradiction. By the\r\nforce of his own assumptions, he had compelled Sarah Good to admit the\r\nreality of the sufferings of the girls, and that they must be caused by\r\nsome one. The amount of what she had said was, that, if caused by one\r\nor the other of them, \"then it must be Osburn,\" for she was sure of her\r\nown innocence. This expression, to which she was driven in\r\nself-exculpation, was perverted by the reporter, Ezekiel Cheever, and\r\nby the magistrate, into an indirect confession and a direct accusation\r\nof Osburn. In the absence of Good, the magistrate told Osburn that Good\r\nhad confessed and accused her. This was a misrepresentation of one, and\r\na false and fraudulent trick upon the other. Considering the feeble\r\ncondition of Sarah Osburn generally, the snares by which she[ii.23] was\r\nbeset, the distressing and bewildering circumstances in which she was\r\nplaced, and the infirm state of her reason, as evidenced in her\r\nstatement of what she saw, or dreamed that she saw and heard,—not\r\nhaving a clear idea which,—her answers, as reported by the prosecutors,\r\nshow that her broken and disordered mind was essentially truthful and\r\ninnocent.\r\n\r\nSarah Osburn was removed from the meeting-house, and Tituba brought in\r\nand examined, as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"Tituba, what evil spirit have you familiarity with?—None.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you hurt these children?—I do not hurt them.\r\n\r\n\"Who is it then?—The Devil, for aught I know.\r\n\r\n\"Did you never see the Devil?—The Devil came to me, and bid me serve\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Who have you seen?—Four women sometimes hurt the children.\r\n\r\n\"Who were they?—Goody Osburn and Sarah Good, and I do not know who the\r\nothers were. Sarah Good and Osburn would have me hurt the children, but\r\nI would not.\r\n\r\n\"(She further saith there was a tall man of Boston that she did see.)\r\n\r\n\"When did you see them?—Last night, at Boston.\r\n\r\n\"What did they say to you?—They said, 'Hurt the children.'\r\n\r\n\"And did you hurt them?—No: there is four women and one man, they hurt\r\nthe children, and then they lay all upon me; and they tell me, if I\r\nwill not hurt the children, they will hurt me.[ii.24]\r\n\r\n\"But did you not hurt them?—Yes; but I will hurt them no more.\r\n\r\n\"Are you not sorry that you did hurt them?—Yes.\r\n\r\n\"And why, then, do you hurt them?—They say, 'Hurt children, or we will\r\ndo worse to you.'\r\n\r\n\"What have you seen?—A man come to me, and say, 'Serve me.'\r\n\r\n\"What service?—Hurt the children: and last night there was an\r\nappearance that said, 'Kill the children;' and, if I would not go on\r\nhurting the children, they would do worse to me.\r\n\r\n\"What is this appearance you see?—Sometimes it is like a hog, and\r\nsometimes like a great dog.\r\n\r\n\"(This appearance she saith she did see four times.)\r\n\r\n\"What did it say to you?—The black dog said, 'Serve me;' but I said, 'I\r\nam afraid.'

Drake,\r\nentitled the \"Witchcraft Delusion in New England.\" It is in the\r\nhandwriting of Jonathan Corwin, very full and minute, and shows that\r\nthe Indian woman was familiar with all the ridiculous and monstrous\r\nfancies then prevalent. The details of her statement cover nearly the\r\nwhole ground of them. While indicating, in most respects, a mind at the\r\nlowest level of general intelligence, they give evidence of cunning and\r\nwariness in the highest degree. This document is also valuable, as it\r\naffords information about particulars, incidentally mentioned and thus\r\nrescued from oblivion, which[ii.27] serve to bring back the life of the\r\npast. Tituba describes the dresses of some of the witches: \"A black\r\nsilk hood, with a white silk hood under it, with top-knots.\" One of\r\nthem wore \"a serge coat, with a white cap.\" The Devil appeared \"in\r\nblack clothes sometimes, sometimes serge coat of other color.\" She\r\nspeaks of the \"lean-to chamber\" in the parsonage, and describes an\r\naërial night ride \"up\" to Thomas Putnam's. \"How did you go? What did\r\nyou ride upon?\" asked the wondering magistrate. \"I ride upon a stick,\r\nor pole, and Good and Osburn behind me: we ride taking hold of one\r\nanother; don't know how we go, for I saw no trees nor path, but was\r\npresently there when we were up.\" In both reports, Tituba describes,\r\nquite graphically, the likenesses in which the Devil appeared to his\r\nconfederates; but Corwin gives the details more fully than Cheever.\r\nWhat the latter reports of the appearances in which the Devil\r\naccompanied Osburn, the former amplifies. \"The thing with two legs and\r\nwings, and a face like a woman,\" \"turns\" into a full woman. The \"hairy\r\nthing\" becomes \"a thing all over hairy, all the face hairy, and a long\r\nnose, and I don't know how to tell how the face looks; is about two or\r\nthree feet high, and goeth upright like a man; and, last night, it\r\nstood before the fire in Mr. Parris's hall.\"\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident that the part played by the Indian woman on this\r\noccasion was pre-arranged. She had, from the first, been concerned with\r\nthe circle of girls in their necromantic operations; and her\r\nstate[ii.28]ments show the materials out of which their ridiculous and\r\nmonstrous stories were constructed. She said that there were four who\r\n\"hurt the children.\" Upon being pressed by the magistrate to tell who\r\nthey were, she named Osburn and Good, but did \"not know who the others\r\nwere.\" Two others were marked; but it was not thought best to bring\r\nthem out until these three examinations had first been made to tell\r\nupon the public mind. Tituba had been apprised of Elizabeth Hubbard's\r\nstory, that she had been \"pinched\" that morning; and, as well as\r\n\"Lieutenant Fuller and others,\" had heard of the delirious exclamation\r\nof Thomas Putnam's sick child during the night. \"Abigail Williams, that\r\nlives with her uncle Parris,\" had communicated to the Indian slave the\r\nstory of \"the woman with two legs and wings.\" In fact, she had been\r\nfully admitted to their councils, and made acquainted with all the\r\nstories they were to tell. But, when it became necessary to avoid\r\nspecifications touching parties whose names it had been decided not to\r\ndivulge at that stage of the business, the wily old servant escapes\r\nfurther interrogation, \"I am blind now: I cannot see.\"\r\n\r\nProceedings connected with these examinations were continued several\r\ndays. The result appears, in the handwriting of John Hathorne, as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n\"Salem Village, March 1, 1691/2.—Tituba, an Indian woman, brought\r\nbefore us by Constable Jos. Herrick, of Salem, upon suspicion of\r\nwitchcraft by her committed, according to the complaint of Jos.\r\nHutchinson and Thomas[ii.29] Putnam, &c., of Salem Village, as appears\r\nper warrant granted, Salem, 29th February, 1691/2. Tituba, upon\r\nexamination, and after some denial, acknowledged the matter of fact,\r\nas, according to her examination given in, more fully will appear, and\r\nwho also charged Sarah Good and Sarah Osburn with the same.\r\n\r\n\"Salem Village, March the 1st, 1691/2.—Sarah Good, Sarah Osburn, and\r\nTituba, an Indian woman, all of Salem Village, being this day brought\r\nbefore us, upon suspicion of witchcraft, &c., by them and every one of\r\nthem committed; Tituba, an Indian woman, acknowledging the matter of\r\nfact, and Sarah Osburn and Sarah Good denying the same before us; but\r\nthere appearing, in all their examinations, sufficient ground to secure\r\nthem all. And, in order to further examination, they were all _per\r\nmittimus_ sent to the jails in the county of Essex.\r\n\r\n\"Salem, March 2.—Sarah Osburn again examined, and also Tituba, as will\r\nappear in their examinations given in. Tituba again acknowledged the\r\nfact, and also accused the other two.\r\n\r\n\"Salem, March 3.—Sarah Osburn, and Tituba, Indian, again examined. The\r\nexamination now given in. Tituba again said the same.\r\n\r\n\"Salem, March 5.—Sarah Good and Tituba again examined; and, in their\r\nexamination, Tituba acknowledged the same she did formerly, and accused\r\nthe other two above said.\r\n\r\nsignatures\r\n\r\n[ii.30]\r\n\r\n\"Salem, March the 7th, 1691/2.—Sarah Good, Sarah Osburn, and Tituba, an\r\nIndian woman, all sent to the jail in Boston, according to their\r\n_mittimuses_, then sent to their Majesties' jail-keeper.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the magistrates did not venture to put into\r\nthis their final record, what they had unfairly tried to make Sarah\r\nOsborn believe, that Sarah Good had been a witness against her. The\r\njail at Ipswich was at a distance of at least ten miles from the\r\nvillage meeting-house, by any road that could then have been travelled.\r\nThe transference of the prisoners day after day must have been very\r\nfatiguing to a sick woman like Sarah Osburn. Sarah Good seems to have\r\nbeen able to bear it. Samuel Braybrook, an assistant constable, having\r\ncharge of her, says, that, on the way to Ipswich, she \"leaped off her\r\nhorse three times;\" that she \"railed against the magistrates, and\r\nendeavored to kill herself.\" He further testified, that, at the very\r\ntime she was performing these feats, Thomas Putnam's daughter, \"at her\r\nfather's house, declared the same.\" As Braybrook was many miles from\r\nThomas Putnam's house, at the moment when his wonderful daughter\r\nexercised this miraculous extent of vision, it would have been more\r\nsatisfactory to have had some other testimony to the fact. I mention\r\nthis to show of what stuff the evidence in these cases was made, and\r\nthe credulity with which every thing was swallowed. The prisoners were\r\nput to examination each day.\r\n\r\nOsburn and Good steadily maintained their innocence. Tituba all along\r\ndeclared herself guilty, and[ii.31] accused the other two of having\r\nbeen with her in confederacy with the Devil. Mr. Parris made the\r\nfollowing deposition, in relation to these examinations, to which he\r\nsubsequently swore in Court, at the trial of Sarah Good:—\r\n\r\n\"The Deposition of Sam: Parris, aged about thirty and nine\r\nyears.—Testifieth and saith, that Elizabeth Parris, Jr., and Abigail\r\nWilliams, and Ann Putnam, Jr., and Elizabeth Hubbard, were most\r\ngrievously and several times tortured during the examination of Sarah\r\nGood, Sarah Osburn, and Tituba, Indian, before the magistrates at Salem\r\nVillage, 1 March, 1692. And the said Tituba being the last of the above\r\nsaid that was examined, they, the above said afflicted persons, were\r\ngrievously distressed until the said Indian began to confess, and then\r\nthey were immediately all quiet the rest of the said Indian woman's\r\nexamination. Also Thomas Putnam, aged about forty years, and Ezekiel\r\nCheever, aged about thirty and six years, testify to the whole of the\r\nabove said; and all the three deponents aforesaid further testify,\r\nthat, after the said Indian began to confess, she was herself very much\r\nafflicted, and in the face of authority at the same time, and openly\r\ncharged the abovesaid Good and Osburn as the persons that afflicted\r\nher, the aforesaid Indian.\"\r\n\r\nBy comparing these depositions with the other documents I have\r\npresented, it will be seen how admirably the whole affair was arranged,\r\nso far as concerned the part played by Tituba. She commences her\r\ntestimony by declaring her innocence. The afflicted children are\r\ninstantly thrown into torments, which, however,[ii.32] subside as soon\r\nas she begins to confess. Immediately after commencing her confession,\r\nand as she proceeds in it, she herself becomes tormented \"in the face\r\nof authority,\" before the eyes of the magistrates and the awestruck\r\ncrowd. Her power to afflict ceases as she breaks loose from her compact\r\nwith the Devil, who sends some unseen confederate, not then brought to\r\nlight, to wreak his vengeance upon her for having confessed. Tituba, as\r\nwell as the girls, showed herself an adept in the arts taught in the\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\nAll we know of Sarah Osburn beyond this date are the following items in\r\nthe Boston jailer's bill \"against the country,\" dated May 29, 1692: \"To\r\nchains for Sarah Good and Sarah Osburn, 14 shillings:\" \"To the keeping\r\nof Sarah Osburn, from the 7th of March to the 10th of May, when she\r\ndied, being nine weeks and two days, £1. 3_s._ 5_d._\"\r\n\r\nThe only further information we have of Tituba is from Calef, who says,\r\n\"The account she since gives of it is, that her master did beat her,\r\nand otherwise abuse her, to make her confess and accuse (such as he\r\ncalled) her sister-witches; and that whatsoever she said by way of\r\nconfessing or accusing others was the effect of such usage: her master\r\nrefused to pay her fees, unless she would stand to what she had said.\r\nCalef further states that she laid in jail until finally \"sold for her\r\nfees.\" The jailer's charge for her \"diet in prison for a year and a\r\nmonth\" appears in a shape that corroborates Calef's statements, which\r\nwere prepared for publication in 1697, and printed in London in\r\n1700.[ii.33] Although zealously devoted to the work of exposing the\r\nenormities connected with the witchcraft prosecutions, there is no\r\nground to dispute the veracity of Calef as to matters of fact. What he\r\nsays of the declarations of Tituba, subsequent to her examination, is\r\nquite consistent with a critical analysis of the details of the record\r\nof that examination. It can hardly be doubted, whatever the amount of\r\nseverity employed to make her act the part assigned her, that she was\r\nused as an instrument to give effect to the delusion.\r\n\r\nNow let us consider the state of things that had been brought about in\r\nthe village, and in the surrounding country, at the close of the first\r\nweek in March, 1692. The terrible sufferings of the girls in Mr.\r\nParris's family and of their associates, for the two preceding months,\r\nhad become known far and wide. A universal sympathy was awakened in\r\ntheir behalf; and a sentiment of horror sunk deep into all hearts, at\r\nthe dread demonstration of the diabolical rage in their afflicted and\r\ntortured persons. A few, very few, distrusted; but the great majority,\r\nninety-nine in a hundred of all the people, were completely swept into\r\nthe torrent. Nathaniel Putnam and Nathaniel Ingersoll were entirely\r\ndeluded, and continued so to the end. Even Joseph Hutchinson was, for a\r\nwhile, carried away. The physicians had all given their opinion that\r\nthe girls were suffering from an \"evil hand.\" The neighboring\r\nministers, after a day's fasting and prayer, and a scrutinizing\r\ninspection of the condition of the afflicted children, had given it,\r\nas[ii.34] the result of their most solemn judgment, that it was a case\r\nof witchcraft. Persons from the neighboring towns had come to the\r\nplace, and with their own eyes received demonstration of the same fact.\r\nMr. Parris made it the topic of his public prayers and preaching. The\r\ngirls, Sunday after Sunday, were under the malign influence, to the\r\ndisturbance and affrightment of the congregation. In all companies, in\r\nall families, all the day long, the sufferings and distraction\r\noccurring in the houses of Mr. Parris, Thomas Putnam, and others, and\r\nin the meeting-house, were topics of excited conversation; and every\r\nvoice was loud in demanding, every mind earnest to ascertain, who were\r\nthe persons, in confederacy with the Devil, thus torturing, pinching,\r\nconvulsing, and bringing to the last extremities of mortal agony, these\r\nafflicted girls. Every one felt, that, if the guilty authors of the\r\nmischief could not be discovered, and put out of the way, no one was\r\nsafe for a moment. At length, when the girls cried out upon Good,\r\nOsburn, and Tituba, there was a general sense of satisfaction and\r\nrelief. It was thought that Satan's power might be checked. The\r\nselection of the first victims was well made. They were just the kind\r\nof persons whom the public prejudice and credulity were prepared to\r\nsuspect and condemn. Their examination was looked for with the utmost\r\ninterest, and all flocked to witness the proceedings.\r\n\r\nIn considering the state of mind of the people, as they crowded into\r\nand around the old meeting-house, we can have no difficulty in\r\nrealizing the[ii.35] tremendous effects of what there occurred. It was\r\nfelt that then, on that spot, the most momentous crisis in the world's\r\nhistory had come. A crime, in comparison with which all other crimes\r\nsink out of notice, was being notoriously and defiantly committed in\r\ntheir midst. The great enemy of God and man was let loose among them.\r\nWhat had filled the hearts of mankind for ages, the world over, with\r\ndread apprehension, was come to pass; and in that village the great\r\nbattle, on whose issue the preservation of the kingdom of the Lord on\r\nthe earth was suspended, had begun. Indeed, no language, no imagery, no\r\nconception of ours, can adequately express the feeling of awful and\r\nterrible solemnity with which all were overwhelmed. No body of men ever\r\nconvened in a more highly wrought state of excitement than pervaded\r\nthat assembly, when the magistrates entered, in all their stern\r\nauthority, and the scene opened on the 1st of March, 1692. A minister,\r\nprobably Mr. Parris, began, according to the custom of the times, with\r\nprayer. From what we know of his skill and talent in meeting such\r\noccasions, it may well be supposed that his language and manner\r\nheightened still more the passions of the hour. The marshal, of tall\r\nand imposing stature and aspect, accompanied by his constables, brought\r\nin the prisoners. Sarah Good, a poverty-stricken, wandering, and\r\nwretched victim of ill-fortune and ill-usage, was put to the bar. Every\r\neffort was made by the examining magistrate, aided by the officious\r\ninterference of the marshal, or other deluded or[ii.36] evil-disposed\r\npersons,—who, like him, were permitted to interpose with charges or\r\nabusive expressions,—to overawe and confound, involve in\r\ncontradictions, and mislead the poor creature, and force her to confess\r\nherself guilty and accuse others. In due time, the \"afflicted children\"\r\nwere brought in; and a scene ensued, such as no person in that crowd or\r\nin that generation had ever witnessed before. Immediately on being\r\nconfronted with the prisoner, and meeting her eye, they fell, as if\r\nstruck dead, to the floor; or screeched in agony; or went into fearful\r\nspasms or convulsive fits; or cried out that they were pricked with\r\npins, pinched, or throttled by invisible hands. They were severally\r\nbrought up to the prisoner, and, upon touching her person, instantly\r\nbecame calm, quiet, and fully restored to their senses. With one voice\r\nthey all declared that Sarah Good had thus tormented them, by her power\r\nas a witch in league with the Devil. The truth of this charge, in the\r\neffect produced by the malign influence proceeding from her, was thus\r\nvisible to all eyes. All saw, too, how instantly upon touching her the\r\ndiabolical effect ceased; the malignant fluid passing back, like an\r\nelectric stream, into the body of the witch. The spectacle was repeated\r\nonce and again, the acting perfect, and the delusion consummated. The\r\nmagistrates and all present considered the guilt of the prisoner\r\ndemonstrated, and regarded her as wilfully and wickedly obstinate in\r\nnot at once confessing what her eyes, as well as theirs, saw. Her\r\nrefusal to confess was considered as the[ii.37] highest proof of her\r\nguilt. They passed judgment against her, committed her to the marshal,\r\nwho hurried her to prison, bound her with cords, and loaded her with\r\nirons; for it was thought that no ordinary fastenings could hold a\r\nwitch. Similar proceedings, with suitable variations, were had with\r\nSarah Osburn and Tituba. The confession of the last-named, the\r\nimmediate relief thereafter of the afflicted children, and the dreadful\r\ntorments which Tituba herself experienced, on the spot, from the unseen\r\nhand of the Devil wreaking vengeance upon her, put the finishing touch\r\nto the delusion. The excitement was kept up, and spread far and wide,\r\nby the officers and magistrates riding in cavalcade, day after day, to\r\nand from the town and village; and by the constables, with their\r\nassistants, carrying their manacled prisoners from jail to jail in\r\nIpswich, Salem, and Boston.\r\n\r\nThe point was now reached when the accusers could safely strike at\r\nhigher game. But time was taken to mature arrangements. Great curiosity\r\nwas felt to know who the other two were whom Tituba saw in connection\r\nwith Good and Osburn in their hellish operations. The girls continued\r\nto suffer torments and fall in fits, and were constantly urged by large\r\nnumbers of people, going from house to house to witness their\r\nsufferings, to reveal who the witches were that still afflicted them.\r\nWhen all was prepared, they began to cry out, with more or less\r\ndistinctness; at first, in significant but general descriptions, and at\r\nlast calling names. The next victim was also well chosen. An\r\naccount[ii.38] has been given, in the First Part, of the notoriety\r\nwhich circumstances had attached to Giles Corey. In 1691 he became a\r\nmember of the church, being then (Vol. I. p. 182) eighty years of age.\r\nFour daughters, all probably by his first wife Margaret, the only\r\nchildren of whom there is any mention, were married to John Moulton,\r\nJohn Parker, and Henry Crosby, of Salem, and William Cleaves, of\r\nBeverly. On the 11th of April, 1664, Corey was married to Mary Britt,\r\nwho died, as appears by the inscription on her gravestone in the old\r\nSalem burial-ground, Aug. 27, 1684. Martha was his third wife. Her age\r\nis unknown. It was entered on the record of the village church, at the\r\ntime of her admission to it, April 27, 1690; but the figures are worn\r\naway from the edge of the page. She was a very intelligent and devout\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nWhen the proceedings relating to witchcraft began, she did not approve\r\nof them, and expressed her want of faith in the \"afflicted children.\"\r\nShe discountenanced the whole affair, and would not follow the\r\nmultitude to the examinations; but was said to have spoken freely of\r\nthe course of the magistrates, saying that their eyes were blinded, and\r\nthat she could open them. It seemed to her clear that they were\r\nviolating common sense and the Word of God, and she was confident that\r\nshe could convince them of their errors. Instead of falling into the\r\ndelusion, she applied herself with renewed earnestness to keep her own\r\nmind under the influence of prayer, and[ii.39] spent more time in\r\ndevotion than ever before. Her husband, however, was completely carried\r\naway by the prevalent fanaticism, believed all he heard, and frequented\r\nthe examinations and the exhibitions of the afflicted children. This\r\ndisagreement became quite serious. Her preferring to stay at home,\r\nshunning the proceedings, and expressing her disapprobation of what was\r\ngoing on, caused an estrangement between them. Her peculiar course\r\ncreated comment, in which he and two of his sons-in-law took part. Some\r\nstrong expressions were used by him, because she acted so strangely at\r\nvariance with everybody else. Her spending so much time on her knees in\r\ndevotion was looked upon as a matter of suspicion. It was said that she\r\ntried to prevent him from following up the examinations, and went so\r\nfar as to remove the saddle from the horse brought up to convey him to\r\nsome meeting at the village connected with the witchcraft excitement.\r\nAngry words, uttered by him, were heard and repeated. As she was a\r\nwoman of notable piety, a professor of religion, and a member of the\r\nchurch, it was evident that her case, if she were proceeded against,\r\nwould still more heighten the panic, and convulse the public mind. It\r\nwould give ground for an idea which the managers of the affair desired\r\nto circulate, that the Devil had succeeded in making inroads into the\r\nvery heart of the church, and was bringing into confederacy with him\r\naged and eminent church-members, who, under color of their profession,\r\nthreatened to extend his influence to the overthrow of[ii.40] all\r\nreligion. It was, indeed, established in the popular sentiments, as a\r\nsign and mark of the Devil's coming, that many professing godliness\r\nwould join his standard.\r\n\r\nFor a day or two, it was whispered round that persons in great repute\r\nfor piety were in the diabolical confederacy, and about to be unmasked.\r\nThe name of Martha Corey, whose open opposition to the proceedings had\r\nbecome known, was passed among the girls in an under-breath, and caught\r\nfrom one to another among those managing the affair. On the 12th of\r\nMarch, Edward Putnam and Ezekiel Cheever, having heard Ann Putnam\r\ndeclare that Goody Corey did often appear to her, and torture her by\r\npinching and otherwise, thought it their duty to go to her, and see\r\nwhat she would say to this complaint; \"she being in church covenant\r\nwith us.\" They mounted their horses about \"the middle of the\r\nafternoon,\" and first went to the house of Thomas Putnam to see his\r\ndaughter Ann, to learn from her what clothes Goody Corey appeared to\r\nher in, in order to judge whether she might not have been mistaken in\r\nthe person. The girl told them, that Goody Corey, knowing that they\r\ncontemplated making this visit, had just appeared in spirit to her, but\r\nhad blinded her so that she could not tell what clothes she wore.\r\nHighly wrought upon by the extraordinary statement of the girl, which\r\nthey received with perfect credulity, the two brethren remounted, and\r\npursued their way. Goody Corey had heard that her name had been bandied\r\nabout by the accusing girls: she also knew that it was one of\r\ntheir[ii.41] arts to pretend to see the clothes people were wearing at\r\nthe time their spectres appeared to them. This required, indeed, no\r\ngreat amount of necromancy; as it is not probable that there was much\r\nvariety in the costume of farmer's wives, at that time, while about\r\ntheir ordinary domestic engagements.\r\n\r\nThey found her alone in her house. As soon as they commenced\r\nconversation, \"in a smiling manner she said, 'I know what you are come\r\nfor; you are come to talk with me about being a witch, but I am none: I\r\ncannot help people's talking of me.'\" Edward Putnam acknowledged that\r\ntheir visit was in consequence of complaints made against her by the\r\nafflicted children. She inquired whether they had undertaken to\r\ndescribe the clothes she then wore. They answered that they had not,\r\nand proceeded to repeat what Ann Putnam had said to them about her\r\nblinding her so that she could not see her clothes. At this she smiled,\r\nno doubt at Ann's cunning artifice to escape having to say what dress\r\nshe then had on. She declared to the two brethren, that \"she did not\r\nthink that there were any witches.\" After considerable talk, in which\r\nthey did not get much to further their purpose, they took their leave.\r\nThe account of this interview, given by Putnam and Cheever, indicates\r\nthat Martha Corey was a sensible, enlightened, and sprightly woman,\r\nperfectly free from the delusion of the day, courteous in her manners\r\nand bearing, and a Christian, well grounded in Scripture.\r\n\r\nThe two brethren returned forthwith to Thomas[ii.42] Putnam's house.\r\nAnn told them that Goody Corey had not troubled her, nor her spectre\r\nappeared, in their absence. She was not inclined to afford them an\r\nopportunity to apply the test of the dress. Both the women showed great\r\nacuteness and caution. As Corey expected the visit, and had heard that\r\nthe girls pretended to be able to say what dress persons were wearing,\r\nshe probably had attired herself in an unusual way on the occasion, to\r\nput them at fault, and expose the falseness of their claims to\r\npreternatural knowledge; and Ann Putnam—her sagacity suggesting the\r\nrisk she was running in the matter of Corey's dress—took refuge in the\r\npretence of blindness. The brethren were too much under delusion to see\r\nthrough the sharp practice of both of them, but considered the fact of\r\nCorey's inquiring of them whether Ann described her dress, as, under\r\nthe circumstances, proof positive against the former.\r\n\r\nWishing to make assurance doubly sure, and to fasten the charge upon\r\nMartha Corey, the managers of the affair sent for her to come to the\r\nhouse of Thomas Putnam two days after this conference. Edward Putnam\r\nwas present, and testified that his niece Ann, immediately upon the\r\nentrance of Goodwife Corey, experienced the most dreadful convulsions\r\nand tortures and distinctly and positively declared that Corey was the\r\nauthor of her sufferings. This was regarded as conclusive evidence;\r\nand, on the 19th of March, a warrant was issued for her arrest. She was\r\nbrought to the house of Nathaniel Ingersoll, on Monday the[ii.43] 21st;\r\nand the following is the account of her examination, in the handwriting\r\nof Mr. Parris. The proceedings took place in the meeting-house at the\r\nvillage. They were introduced by a prayer from the Rev. Nicholas Noyes.\r\nOn some of these occasions Mr. Hale and perhaps others, but usually Mr.\r\nNoyes or Mr. Parris officiated. We may suppose, from what we know of\r\ntheir general deportment in connection with these scenes, that their\r\nperformances, under the cover of a devotional exercise, expressed and\r\nenforced a decided prejudgment of the case in hand against the\r\nprisoners, and partook of the character of indictments as much as of\r\nprayers.\r\n\r\n\"_The Examination of Martha Corey._\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hathorne: You are now in the hands of authority. Tell me, now, why\r\nyou hurt these persons.—I do not.\r\n\r\n\"Who doth?—Pray, give me leave to go to prayer.\r\n\r\n\"(This request was made sundry times.)\r\n\r\n\"We do not send for you to go to prayer; but tell me why you hurt\r\nthese.—I am an innocent person. I never had to do with witchcraft since\r\nI was born. I am a gospel woman.\r\n\r\n\"Do not you see these complain of you?—The Lord open the eyes of the\r\nmagistrates and ministers: the Lord show his power to discover the\r\nguilty.\r\n\r\n\"Tell us who hurts these children.—I do not know.\r\n\r\n\"If you be guilty of this fact, do you think you can hide it?—The Lord\r\nknows.\r\n\r\n\"Well, tell us what you know of this matter.—Why, I am a gospel woman;\r\nand do you think I can have to do with witchcraft too?\r\n\r\n\"How could you tell, then, that the child was bid to ob[ii.44]serve\r\nwhat clothes you wore, when some came to speak with you?\r\n\r\n\"(Cheever interrupted her, and bid her not begin with a lie; and so\r\nEdward Putnam declared the matter.)\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hathorne: Who told you that?—He said the child said.\r\n\r\n\"Cheever: You speak falsely.\r\n\r\n\"(Then Edward Putnam read again.)\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hathorne: Why did you ask if the child told what clothes you\r\nwore?—My husband told me the others told.\r\n\r\n\"Who told you about the clothes? Why did you ask that question?—Because\r\nI heard the children told what clothes the others wore.\r\n\r\n\"Goodman Corey, did you tell her?\r\n\r\n\"(The old man denied that he told her so.)\r\n\r\n\"Did you not say your husband told you so?\r\n\r\n\"(No answer.)\r\n\r\n\"Who hurts these children? Now look upon them.—I cannot help it.\r\n\r\n\"Did you not say you would tell the truth why you asked that question?\r\nhow came you to the knowledge?—I did but ask.\r\n\r\n\"You dare thus to lie in all this assembly. You are now before\r\nauthority. I expect the truth: you promised it. Speak now, and tell who\r\ntold you what clothes.—Nobody.\r\n\r\n\"How came you to know that the children would be examined what clothes\r\nyou wore?—Because I thought the child was wiser than anybody if she\r\nknew.\r\n\r\n\"Give an answer: you said your husband told you.—He told me the\r\nchildren said I afflicted them.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know what they came for? Answer me this truly: will you say\r\nhow you came to know what they[ii.45] came for?—I had heard speech that\r\nthe children said I troubled them, and I thought that they might come\r\nto examine.\r\n\r\n\"But how did you know it?—I thought they did.\r\n\r\n\"Did not you say you would tell the truth? who told you what they came\r\nfor?—Nobody.\r\n\r\n\"How did you know?—I did think so.\r\n\r\n\"But you said you knew so.\r\n\r\n\"(Children: There is a man whispering in her ear.)\r\n\r\n\"Hathorne continued: What did he say to you?—We must not believe all\r\nthat these distracted children say.\r\n\r\n\"Cannot you tell what that man whispered?—I saw nobody.\r\n\r\n\"But did not you hear?—No.\r\n\r\n\"(Here was extreme agony of all the afflicted.)\r\n\r\n\"If you expect mercy of God, you must look for it in God's way, by\r\nconfession. Do you think to find mercy by aggravating your sins?—A true\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n\"Look for it, then, in God's way.—So I do.\r\n\r\n\"Give glory to God and confess, then.—But I cannot confess.\r\n\r\n\"Do not you see how these afflicted do charge you?—We must not believe\r\ndistracted persons.\r\n\r\n\"Who do you improve to hurt them?—I improved none.\r\n\r\n\"Did not you say our eyes were blinded, you would open them?—Yes, to\r\naccuse the innocent.\r\n\r\n\"(Then Crosby gave in evidence.)\r\n\r\n\"Why cannot the girl stand before you?—I do not know.\r\n\r\n\"What did you mean by that?—I saw them fall down.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to be an insulting speech, as if they could not stand before\r\nyou.—They cannot stand before others.\r\n\r\n\"But you said they cannot stand before you. Tell me[ii.46] what was\r\nthat turning upon the spit by you?—You believe the children that are\r\ndistracted. I saw no spit.\r\n\r\n\"Here are more than two that accuse you for witchcraft. What do you\r\nsay?—I am innocent.\r\n\r\n\"(Then Mr. Hathorne read further of Crosby's evidence.)\r\n\r\n\"What did you mean by that,—the Devil could not stand before you?\r\n\r\n\"(She denied it. Three or four sober witnesses confirmed it.)\r\n\r\n\"What can I do? Many rise up against me.\r\n\r\n\"Why, confess.—So I would, if I were guilty.\r\n\r\n\"Here are sober persons. What do you say to them? You are a gospel\r\nwoman; will you lie?\r\n\r\n\"(Abigail cried out, 'Next sabbath is sacrament-day; but she shall not\r\ncome there.')\r\n\r\n\"I do not care.\r\n\r\n\"You charge these children with distraction: it is a note of\r\ndistraction when persons vary in a minute; but these fix upon you. This\r\nis not the manner of distraction.—When all are against me, what can I\r\nhelp it?\r\n\r\n\"Now tell me the truth, will you? Why did you say that the magistrates'\r\nand ministers' eyes were blinded, you would open them?\r\n\r\n\"(She laughed, and denied it.)\r\n\r\n\"Now tell us how we shall know who doth hurt these, if you do not?—Can\r\nan innocent person be guilty?\r\n\r\n\"Do you deny these words?—Yes.\r\n\r\n\"Tell us who hurts these.

Putnam's with?—I never struck\r\nher in my life.\r\n\r\n\"There are two that saw you strike her with an iron rod.—I had no hand\r\nin it.\r\n\r\n\"Who had? Do you believe these children are bewitched?—They may, for\r\naught I know: I have no hand in it.\r\n\r\n\"You say you are no witch. Maybe you mean you never covenanted with the\r\nDevil. Did you never deal with any familiar?—No, never.\r\n\r\n\"What bird was that the children spoke of?\r\n\r\n\"(Then witnesses spoke: What bird was it?)\r\n\r\n\"I know no bird.\r\n\r\n\"It may be you have engaged you will not confess; but God knows.—So he\r\ndoth.\r\n\r\n\"Do you believe you shall go unpunished?—I have nothing to do with\r\nwitchcraft.\r\n\r\n\"Why was you not willing your husband should come to the former session\r\nhere?—But he came, for all.\r\n\r\n\"Did not you take the saddle off?—I did not know what it was for.\r\n\r\n\"Did you not know what it was for?—I did not know that it would be to\r\nany benefit.\r\n\r\n\"(Somebody said that she would not have them help to find out witches.)\r\n\r\n\"Did you not say you would open our eyes? Why do you not?—I never\r\nthought of a witch.\r\n\r\n\"Is it a laughing matter to see these afflicted persons?\r\n\r\n\"(She denied it.

Tell how many.\r\n\r\n\"(She laughed. The children cried there was a yellow-bird with her.\r\nWhen Mr. Hathorne asked her about it, she laughed. When her hands were\r\nat liberty, the afflicted persons were pinched.)\r\n\r\n\"Why do not you tell how the Devil comes in your shape, and hurts\r\nthese? You said you would.—How can I know how?\r\n\r\n\"Why did you say you would show us?\r\n\r\n\"(She laughed again.)\r\n\r\n\"What book is that you would have these children write in?—What book?\r\nWhere should I have a book? I showed them none, nor have none, nor\r\nbrought none.\r\n\r\n\"(The afflicted cried out there was a man whispering in her ears.)\r\n\r\n\"What book did you carry to Mary Walcot?—I carried none.

One of Giles\r\nCorey's daughters, Deliverance, had married, June 5, 1683, Henry\r\nCrosby, who lived on land conveyed to him by her father in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood. He was the person whose written testimony was\r\nread by the magistrate. Its purport seems to have been to prove that\r\nMartha Corey had said that the accusing girls could not stand before\r\nher, and that the Devil could not stand before her. She had,\r\nundoubtedly, great confidence in her own innocence, and in the power of\r\ntruth and prayer, to silence false accusers, and expressed herself in\r\nthe forcible language which Parris's report of the examination shows\r\nthat she was well able to use. It is almost amusing to see how the\r\npride of the magistrates was touched, and their wrath kindled, by what\r\nshe was reported to have said, \"that the magistrates' and ministers'\r\neyes were blinded, and that she would open them.\" It rankled in\r\nHathorne's breast: he returns to it again and again, and works himself\r\nup to a higher degree of resentment on each recurrence. Mr. Noyes's ire\r\nwas[ii.51] roused, and he, too, put in a stroke. It will be noticed,\r\nthat she avoided a contradiction of her husband, and could not be\r\nbrought to give the names of persons from whom she had received\r\ninformation. \"If you will all go hang me, how can I help it?\" \"Ye are\r\nall against me.\" \"What can I do, when many rise up against me?\" \"When\r\nall are against me, what can I [say to] help it?\" Situated as she was,\r\nall that she could do was to give them no advantage, or opportunity to\r\nensnare her, and to avoid compromising others; and it must be allowed\r\nthat she showed much presence and firmness of mind. Her request, made\r\nat the opening of the examination, and at \"sundry times,\" to \"go to\r\nprayer,\" somewhat confounded them. She probably was led to make and\r\nurge the request particularly in consequence of the tenor of Mr.\r\nNoyes's prayer at the opening. She felt that it was no more than fair\r\nthat there should be a prayer on her side, as well as on the other. It\r\nmight well be feared, that, if allowed to offer a prayer, coming from a\r\nperson in her situation, an aged professor, and one accustomed to\r\nexpress herself in devotional exercises, it might produce a deep\r\nimpression upon the whole assembly. To refuse such a request had a hard\r\nlook; but, as the magistrates saw, it never would have done to have\r\npermitted it. It would have reversed the position of all concerned. The\r\nlatter part of the examination has the appearance that she was\r\nsuspected to be unsound on a particular article of the prevalent creed.\r\nIt is much to be regretted that the abrasion of the paper at the[ii.52]\r\nfolding has obliterated her last answer to this part of the\r\ninquisition. It is singular that Mr. Parris has left the blank in her\r\nfinal answer. Probably she used her customary expression, \"I am a\r\ngospel woman.\" The writing, at this point, is very clear and distinct;\r\nand a vacant space is left, just as it is given above.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Martha Corey was known to be an eminently religious\r\nperson, and very much given to acts of devotion, constituted a serious\r\nobstacle, no doubt, in the way of the prosecutors. Parris's record of\r\nthe examination shows how they managed to get over it. They gave the\r\nimpression that her frequent and long prayers were addressed to the\r\nDevil.\r\n\r\nThe disagreement between her and her husband, touching the witchcraft\r\nprosecutions, brought him into a very uncomfortable predicament. With\r\nhis characteristic imprudence of speech, he had probably expressed\r\nhimself strongly against her unbelief in the sufferings of the girls\r\nand her refusal to attend the exhibitions of their tortures, or the\r\nexamination of persons accused. He was, unquestionably, highly shocked\r\nand incensed at her open repudiation of the whole doctrine of\r\nwitchcraft. Although he had become, in his old age, a professor and a\r\nfervently religious man, perhaps he fell back, in his resentment of her\r\ncourse, into his life-long rough phrases, and said that she acted as\r\nthough the Devil was in her. He might have said that she prayed like a\r\nwitch. Being entirely carried away by the delusion, he had his own\r\nmarvellous stories to tell about his cattle's being be[ii.53]witched,\r\n&c. His talk, undoubtedly, came to the ears of the prosecutors; and\r\nthey seem to have taken steps to induce him to come forward as a\r\nwitness against her. The following document is among the papers:—\r\n\r\n\"The evidence of Giles Corey testifieth and saith, that last Saturday,\r\nin the evening, sitting by the fire, my wife asked me to go to bed. I\r\ntold her I would go to prayer; and, when I went to prayer, I could not\r\nutter my desires with any sense, nor open my mouth to speak.\r\n\r\n\"My wife did perceive it, and came towards me, and said she was coming\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n\"After this, in a little space, I did, according to my measure, attend\r\nthe duty.\r\n\r\n\"Some time last week, I fetched an ox, well, out of the woods about\r\nnoon: and, he laying down in the yard, I went to raise him to yoke him;\r\nbut he could not rise, but dragged his hinder parts, as if he had been\r\nhip-shot. But after did rise.\r\n\r\n\"I had a cat sometimes last week strangely taken on the sudden, and did\r\nmake me think she would have died presently. My wife bid me knock her\r\nin the head, but I did not; and since, she is well.\r\n\r\n\"Another time, going to duties, I was interrupted for a space; but\r\nafterward I was helped according to my poor measure. My wife hath been\r\nwont to sit up after I went to bed: and I have perceived her to kneel\r\ndown on the hearth, as if she were at prayer, but heard nothing.\r\n\r\n\"_At the examination of Sarah_ Good and others, my wife was willing\r\n\r\n\"March 24, 1692.\" [ii.54]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing document does not express the idea that he thought his\r\nwife was a witch. He states what he observed, and what happened to him\r\nand to his cattle. He evidently supposed they were bewitched, and that\r\nhe was obstructed, in going to prayer, in a strange manner; but he does\r\nnot, in terms, charge it upon her. It gives an interesting insight of\r\nthe innermost domestic life of the period, in a farmhouse, and exhibits\r\nstriking touches of the character and ways of these two old people. It\r\nillustrates the state of the imagination prevailing among those who\r\nwere carried away by the delusion. If an ox had a sprained muscle, or a\r\ncat a fit of indigestion, it was thought to be the work of an evil\r\nhand. Poor old Giles had come late to a religious life, and, it is to\r\nbe feared, was a novice in prayer. It is no wonder that he was not an\r\nadept in \"uttering his desires,\" and experienced occasionally some\r\ndifficulty in arranging and expressing his devotional sentiments.\r\n\r\nThere is something very singular in the appearance of the foregoing\r\ndeposition. Purporting to be a piece of testimony, it was not given in\r\nthe usual and regular way. It does not indicate before whom it was\r\nmade. It is not attested in the ordinary manner; apparently, was not\r\nsworn to in the presence of persons authorized to act in such cases;\r\nwas never offered in court or anywhere. It is a disconnected paper\r\nfound among the remnants of the miscellaneous collection in the clerk's\r\noffice, and is evidently an unfinished document; the words in Italics,\r\nat the close, being erased by a line running through them.[ii.55]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the parties who tried to get the old man to testify\r\nagainst his wife discovered that they could not draw any thing from him\r\nto answer their designs, but that there was danger that his evidence\r\nwould be favorable to her, and gave up the attempt to use him on the\r\noccasion. The fact that he would not lend himself to their purposes\r\nperhaps led to resentment on their part, which may explain the\r\nsubsequent proceedings against him.\r\n\r\nThe document, in its chirography, suggests the idea that it was written\r\nby Mr. Noyes, which is not improbable, as Corey was a member of his\r\ncongregation and church. Noyes was deeply implicated in the\r\nprosecutions, and violent in driving them on. The handwriting of the\r\noriginal papers reveals the agency of those who were the most busy in\r\nprocuring evidence against persons accused. That of Thomas Putnam\r\noccurs in very many instances. But Mr. Parris was, beyond all others,\r\nthe busiest and most active prosecutor. The depositions of the child\r\nAbigail Williams, his niece and a member of his family, were written by\r\nhim, as also a great number of others. He took down most of the\r\nexaminations, put in a deposition of his own whenever he could, and was\r\nalways ready to indorse those of others.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered, that, when Tituba was put through her\r\nexamination, she said \"four women sometimes hurt the children.\" She\r\nnamed Good and Osburn, but pretended to have been blinded as to the\r\nothers. Martha Corey was, in due time, as we[ii.56] have seen, brought\r\nout. The fourth was the venerable head of a large and prominent family,\r\nand a member of the mother-church in Salem. She had never transferred\r\nher relations to the village church, with which, however, she had\r\ngenerally worshipped, and probably communed. Being one of the chief\r\nmatrons of the place, she was seated in the meeting-house with ladies\r\nof similar age and standing, occupying the same bench or compartment\r\nwith the widow of Thomas Putnam, Sr. The women were seated separately\r\nfrom the men; and the only rule applied among them was eminence in\r\nyears and respectability.\r\n\r\nIt has always been considered strange and unaccountable, that a person\r\nof such acknowledged worth as Rebecca Nurse, of infirm health and\r\nadvanced years, should have been selected among the early victims of\r\nthe witchcraft prosecutions. Jealousies and prejudices, such as often\r\ninfest rural neighborhoods, may have been engendered, in minds open to\r\nsuch influences, by the prosperity and growing influence of her family.\r\nIt may be that animosities kindled by the long and violent land\r\ncontroversy, with which many parties had been incidentally connected,\r\nlingered in some breasts. There are decided indications, that the\r\npassions awakened by the angry contest between the village and\r\n\"Topsfield men,\" and which the collisions of a half-century had all\r\nalong exasperated and hardened, may have been concentrated against the\r\nNurses. Isaac Easty, whose wife was a sister of Rebecca Nurse, and the\r\nTownes, who were her brothers or near kins[ii.57]men, were the leaders\r\nof the Topsfield men. It is a significant circumstance, in this\r\nconnection, that to one of the most vehement resolutions passed at\r\nmeetings of the inhabitants of the village, against the claims of\r\nTopsfield, Samuel Nurse, her eldest son, and Thomas Preston, her eldest\r\nson-in-law, entered their protest on the record; and, on another\r\nsimilar occasion, her husband Francis Nurse, her son Samuel, and two of\r\nher sons-in-law, Preston and Tarbell, took the same course. So far as\r\nthe family sided with Topsfield in that controversy, it naturally\r\nexposed them to the ill-will of the people of the village. An analysis\r\nof the names and residences of the persons proceeded against,\r\nthroughout the prosecutions, will show to what an extent hostile\r\nmotives were supplied from this quarter. The families of Wildes, How,\r\nHobbs, Towne, Easty, and others who were \"cried out\" upon by the\r\nafflicted children, occupied lands claimed by parties adverse to the\r\nvillage. What, more than all these causes, was sufficient to create a\r\nfeeling against the Nurses, is the fact that they were opposed to the\r\nparty which had existed from the beginning in the parish composed\r\noriginally of the friends of Bayley. To crown the whole, when the\r\nexcitement occasioned by the extraordinary doings in Mr. Parris's\r\nfamily began to display itself, and the \"afflicted children\" were\r\nbrought into notice, the members of this family, with the exception,\r\nfor a time, of Thomas Preston, discountenanced the whole thing. They\r\nabsented themselves from meeting, on account of the disturb[ii.58]ances\r\nand disorders the girls were allowed to make during the services of\r\nworship, in the congregation, on the Lord's Day. Unfriendly remarks,\r\nfrom whatever cause, made in the hearing of the girls, provided\r\nsubjects for them to act upon. Some persons behind them, suggesting\r\nnames in this way, whether carelessly or with malicious intent, were\r\nguilty of all the misery that was created and blood that was shed.\r\n\r\nIt became a topic of rumor, that Rebecca Nurse was soon to be brought\r\nout. It reached the ears of her friends, and the following document\r\ncomes in at this point:—\r\n\r\n\"We whose names are underwritten being desired to go to Goodman Nurse\r\nhis house, to speak with his wife, and to tell her that several of the\r\nafflicted persons mentioned her; and accordingly we went, and we found\r\nher in a weak and low condition in body as she told us, and had been\r\nsick almost a week. And we asked how it was otherwise with her: and she\r\nsaid she blessed God for it, she had more of his presence in this\r\nsickness than sometime she have had, but not so much as she desired;\r\nbut she would, with the apostle, press forward to the mark; and many\r\nother places of Scripture to the like purpose. And then, of her own\r\naccord, she began to speak of the affliction that was amongst them, and\r\nin particular of Mr. Parris his family, and how she was grieved for\r\nthem, though she had not been to see them, by reason of fits that she\r\nformerly used to have; for people said it was awful to behold: but she\r\npitied them with all her heart, and went to God for them. But she said\r\nshe heard that there was persons spoke of that were as innocent as she\r\nwas, she believed; and, after much to this purpose,[ii.59] we told her\r\nwe heard that she was spoken of also. 'Well,' she said, 'if it be so,\r\nthe will of the Lord be done:' she sat still a while, being as it were\r\namazed; and then she said, 'Well, as to this thing I am as innocent as\r\nthe child unborn; but surely,' she said, 'what sin hath God found out\r\nin me unrepented of, that he should lay such an affliction upon me in\r\nmy old age?' and, according to our best observation, we could not\r\ndiscern that she knew what we came for before we told her.\r\n\r\nIsrael Porter,\r\nElizabeth Porter.\r\n\r\n\"To the substance of what is above, we, if called thereto, are ready to\r\ntestify on oath.\r\n\r\nDaniel Andrew,\r\nPeter Cloyse.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth Porter, who joins her husband in making this statement, was a\r\nsister of John Hathorne, the examining magistrate, and the\r\nmother-in-law of Joseph Putnam, who was among the very few that\r\ncondemned the proceedings from the first. She stood, therefore, between\r\nthe two parties. The character of each of the signers and indorsers of\r\nthis interesting paper is sufficient proof that its statements are\r\ntruthful. It cannot but excite the most affecting sensibilities in\r\nevery breast. This venerable lady, whose conversation and bearing were\r\nso truly saint-like, was an invalid of extremely delicate condition and\r\nappearance, the mother of a large family, embracing sons, daughters,\r\ngrandchildren, and one or more great-grandchildren. She was a woman of\r\npiety, and simplicity of heart. In all probability, she shared in the\r\npopular belief on the subject of witchcraft, and sup[ii.60]posed that\r\nthe sufferings of the children were real, and that they were afflicted\r\nby an \"evil hand.\" At the very time that she was sorrowfully\r\nsympathizing with them and Mr. Parris's family, and praying for them,\r\nthey were circulating suspicions against her, and maturing their plans\r\nfor her destruction.\r\n\r\nRebecca Nurse was a daughter of William Towne, of Yarmouth, Norfolk\r\nCounty, England, where she was baptized, Feb. 21, 1621. Her sister\r\nMary, who married Isaac Easty, was baptized at the same place, Aug. 24,\r\n1634. The records of the First Church at Salem, Sept. 3, 1648, give the\r\nbaptism of \"Joseph and Sarah, children of Sister Towne.\" Sarah was at\r\nthat time seven years of age. She became the wife of Edmund Bridges,\r\nand afterwards of Peter Cloyse.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of March, a warrant was issued, on complaint of Edward\r\nPutnam, and Jonathan, son of John Putnam, for the arrest of \"Rebecca,\r\nwife of Francis Nurse;\" and the next morning, at eight o'clock, she was\r\nbrought to the house of Nathaniel Ingersoll, in the custody of George\r\nHerrick, the marshal of Essex. There were several distinct indictments,\r\nfour of which, for having practised \"certain detestable arts called\r\nwitchcraft\" upon Ann Putnam, Mary Walcot, Elizabeth Hubbard, and\r\nAbigail Williams, are preserved. The examination took place forthwith\r\nat the meeting-house. The age, character, connections, and appearance\r\nof the prisoner, made the occasion one of the extremest interest.\r\nHathorne, the magistrate, began the proceedings by addressing one of\r\nthe afflicted:[ii.61] \"What do you say? Have you seen this woman hurt\r\nyou?\" The answer was, \"Yes, she beat me this morning.\" Hathorne,\r\naddressing another of the afflicted, said, \"Abigail, have you been hurt\r\nby this woman?\" Abigail answered, \"Yes.\" At that point, Ann Putnam fell\r\ninto a grievous fit, and, while in her spasms, cried out that it was\r\nRebecca Nurse who was thus afflicting her. As soon as Ann's fit was\r\nover, and order restored, Hathorne said, \"Goody Nurse, here are two,\r\nAnn Putnam the child, and Abigail Williams, complain of your hurting\r\nthem. What do you say to it?\" The prisoner replied, \"I can say, before\r\nmy eternal Father, I am innocent, and God will clear my innocency.\"\r\nHathorne, apparently touched for the moment by her language and\r\nbearing, said, \"Here is never a one in the assembly but desires it;\r\nbut, if you be guilty, pray God discover you.\" Henry Kenney rose up\r\nfrom the body of the assembly to speak. Hathorne permitted the\r\ninterruption, and said, \"Goodman Kenney, what do you say?\" Then Kenney\r\ncomplained of the prisoner, \"and further said, since this Nurse came\r\ninto the house, he was seized twice with an amazed condition.\"\r\nHathorne, addressing the prisoner, said, \"Not only these, but the wife\r\nof Mr. Thomas Putnam, accuseth you by credible information, and that\r\nboth of tempting her to iniquity and of greatly hurting her.\" The\r\nprisoner again affirmed her innocence, and said, in answer to the\r\ncharge of having hurt these persons, that \"she had not been able to get\r\nout of doors these eight or nine days.\"[ii.62] Hathorne then called\r\nupon Edward Putnam, who, as the record says, \"gave in his relate,\"\r\nwhich undoubtedly was a statement of his having seen the afflicted in\r\ntheir sufferings, and heard them accuse Rebecca Nurse as their\r\ntormentor. Hathorne said, \"Is this true, Goody Nurse?\" She denied that\r\nshe had ever hurt them or any one else in her life. Hathorne repeated,\r\n\"You see these accuse you: is it true?\" She answered, \"No.\" He again\r\nput the question, \"Are you an innocent person relating to this\r\nwitchcraft?\" It seems, from his manner, that he was beginning really to\r\ndoubt whether she might not be innocent; and perhaps the feeling of the\r\nmultitude was yielding in her favor.\r\n\r\nHere Thomas Putnam's wife cried out, \"Did you not bring the black man\r\nwith you? Did you not bid me tempt God, and die? How oft have you eat\r\nand drank your own damnation?\" This sudden outbreak, from such a\r\nsource, accompanied with the wild and apparently supernatural energy\r\nand uncontrollable vehemence with which the words were uttered, roused\r\nthe multitude to the utmost pitch of horror; and the prisoner seems to\r\nhave been shocked at the dreadful exhibition of madness in the woman\r\nand in the assembly. Releasing her hands from confinement, she spread\r\nthem out towards heaven, and exclaimed, \"O Lord, help me!\" Instantly,\r\nthe whole company of the afflicted children \"were grievously vexed.\"\r\nAfter a while, the tumult subsided, and Hathorne again addressed her,\r\n\"Do you not see what a solemn condition[ii.63] these are in? When your\r\nhands are loosed, the persons are afflicted.\" Then Mary Walcot and\r\nElizabeth Hubbard came forward, and accused her. Hathorne again\r\naddressed her, \"Here are these two grown persons now accuse. What say\r\nyou? Do not you see these afflicted persons, and hear them accuse you?\"\r\nShe answered, \"The Lord knows I have not hurt them. I am an innocent\r\nperson.\" Hathorne continued, \"It is very awful to all to see these\r\nagonies, and you, an old professor, thus charged with contracting with\r\nthe Devil by the effects of it, and yet to see you stand with dry eyes\r\nwhere there are so many wet.\" She answered, \"You do not know my heart.\"\r\nHathorne, \"You would do well, if you are guilty, to confess, and give\r\nglory to God.\"—\"I am as clear as the child unborn.\" Hathorne continued,\r\n\"What uncertainty there may be in apparitions, I know not: yet this\r\nwith me strikes hard upon you, that you are, at this very present,\r\ncharged with familiar spirits,—this is your bodily person they speak\r\nto; they say now they see these familiar spirits come to your bodily\r\nperson. Now, what do you say to that?\"—\"I have none, sir.\"—\"If you\r\nhave, confess, and give glory to God. I pray God clear you, if you be\r\ninnocent, and, if you are guilty, discover you; and therefore give me\r\nan upright answer. Have you any familiarity with these spirits?\"—\"No: I\r\nhave none but with God alone.\" It looks as if again the magistrate\r\nbegan to open his mind to a fair view of the case. He seems to have\r\nsought satisfaction in reference to all the charges[ii.64] that had\r\nbeen made against her. She was suffering from infirmities of body, the\r\nresult not only of age, but of the burdens of life often pressing down\r\nthe physical frame, particularly of those who have borne large families\r\nof children. The magistrate had heard some malignant gossip of this\r\nkind, and he asked, \"How came you sick? for there is an odd discourse\r\nof that in the mouths of many.\" She replied that she suffered from\r\nweakness of stomach. He inquired, more specifically, \"Have you no\r\nwounds?\" Her answer was, that her ailments and weaknesses, all her\r\nbodily infirmities, were the natural effects of what she had\r\nexperienced in a long life. \"I have none but old age.\"—\"You do know\r\nwhether you are guilty, and have familiarity with the Devil; and now,\r\nwhen you are here present, to see such a thing as these testify,—a\r\nblack man whispering in your ear, and birds about you,—what do you say\r\nto it?\"—\"It is all false: I am clear.\"—\"Possibly, you may apprehend you\r\nare no witch; but have you not been led aside by temptations that\r\nway?\"—\"I have not.\" At this point, it almost seems that Hathorne was\r\nyielding to the moral effect of the evidence she bore in her deportment\r\nand language, the impress of conscious innocence in her countenance,\r\nand the manifestation of true Christian purity and integrity in her\r\nwhole manner and bearing. Instead of pressing her with further\r\ninterrogatories, he gave way to an expression, in the form of a\r\nsoliloquy or ejaculation, \"What a sad thing is it, that a church-member\r\nhere, and now another of Salem,[ii.65] should thus be accused and\r\ncharged!\" Upon hearing this rather ambiguous expression of the\r\nmagistrate, Mrs. Pope fell into a grievous fit.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pope was the wife of Joseph Pope, living with his mother, the\r\nwidow Gertrude Pope, on the farm shown on the map. She had followed up\r\nthe meetings of the circle, been a constant witness of the sufferings\r\nof the \"afflicted children,\" and attended all the public examinations,\r\nuntil her nervous system was excited beyond restraint, and for a while\r\nshe went into fits and her imagination was bewildered. She acted with\r\nthe accusers, and participated in their sufferings. On some occasions,\r\nher conduct was wild and extravagant to the highest degree. At the\r\nexamination of Martha Corey, she was conspicuous for the violence of\r\nher actions. In the midst of the proceedings, and in the presence of\r\nthe magistrates and hundreds of people, she threw her muff at the\r\nprisoner; and, that missing, pulled off her shoe, and, more successful\r\nthis time, hit her square on the head. Hers seems, however, to have\r\nbeen a case of mere delusion, amounting to temporary insanity. That it\r\nwas not deliberate and cold-blooded imposture is rendered probable by\r\nthe fact, that she was rescued from the hallucination, and, with her\r\nhusband, among the foremost to deplore and denounce the whole affair.\r\nBut, when a woman of her position acted in this manner, on such an\r\noccasion, and then went into convulsions, and the whole company of\r\nafflicted persons joined in, the confusion, tumult, and frightfulness\r\nof[ii.66] the scene can hardly be imagined, certainly it cannot be\r\ndescribed in words.\r\n\r\nQuiet being restored, Hathorne proceeded: \"Tell us, have you not had\r\nvisible appearances, more than what is common in nature?\"—\"I have none,\r\nnor never had in my life.\"—\"Do you think these suffer voluntary or\r\ninvoluntary?\"—\"I cannot tell.\"—\"That is strange: every one can\r\njudge.\"—\"I must be silent.\"—\"They accuse you of hurting them; and, if\r\nyou think it is not unwillingly, but by design, you must look upon them\r\nas murderers.\"—\"I cannot tell what to think of it.\" This answer was\r\nconsidered as very aspersive in its bearing upon the witnesses, and she\r\nwas charged with having called them murderers. Being hard of hearing,\r\nshe did not always take in the whole import of questions put to her.\r\nShe denied that she said she thought them murderers; all she said, and\r\nthat she stood to to the last, was that she could not tell what to make\r\nof their conduct. Finally, Hathorne put this question, and called for\r\nan answer, \"Do you think these suffer against their wills or not?\" She\r\nanswered, \"I do not think these suffer against their wills.\" To this\r\npoint she was not afraid or unwilling to go, in giving an opinion of\r\nthe conduct of the accusing girls. Infirm, half deaf, cross-questioned,\r\ncircumvented, surrounded with folly, uproar, and outrage, as she was,\r\nthey could not intimidate her to say less, or entrap her to say more.\r\n\r\nThen another line of criminating questions was started by the\r\nmagistrate: \"Why did you never visit[ii.67] these afflicted\r\npersons?\"—\"Because I was afraid I should have fits too.\" On every\r\nmotion of her body, \"fits followed upon the complainants, abundantly\r\nand very frequently.\" As soon as order was again restored, Hathorne,\r\nbeing, as he always was, wholly convinced of the reality of the\r\nsufferings of the \"afflicted children,\" addressed her thus, \"Is it not\r\nan unaccountable case, that, when you are examined, these persons are\r\nafflicted?\" Seeing that he and the whole assembly put faith in the\r\naccusers, her only reply was, \"I have got nobody to look to but God.\"\r\nAs she uttered these words, she naturally attempted to raise her hands,\r\nwhereupon \"the afflicted persons were seized with violent fits of\r\ntorture.\" After silence was again restored, the magistrate pressed his\r\nquestions still closer. \"Do you believe these afflicted persons are\r\nbewitched?\" She answered, \"I do think they are.\" It will be noticed\r\nthat there was this difference between Rebecca Nurse and Martha Corey:\r\nThe latter was an utter heretic on the point of the popular faith\r\nrespecting witchcraft; she did not believe that there were any witches,\r\nand she looked upon the declarations and actions of the \"afflicted\r\nchildren\" as the ravings of \"distracted persons.\" The former seems to\r\nhave held the opinions of the day, and had no disbelief in witchcraft:\r\nshe was willing to admit that the children were bewitched; but she knew\r\nher own innocence, and nothing could move her from the consciousness of\r\nit. Mr. Hathorne continued, \"When this witchcraft came upon the stage,\r\nthere was no suspicion[ii.68] of Tituba, Mr. Parris's Indian woman. She\r\nprofessed much love to that child,—Betty Parris; but it was her\r\napparition did the mischief: and why should not you also be guilty, for\r\nyour apparition doth hurt also?\" Her answer was, \"Would you have me\r\nbelie myself?\" Weary, probably, of the protracted proceedings, her head\r\ndrooped on one side; and forthwith the necks of the afflicted children\r\nwere bent in the same way. This new demonstration of the diabolical\r\npower that proceeded from her filled the house with increased awe, and\r\nspread horrible conviction of her guilt through all minds. Elizabeth\r\nHubbard's neck was fixed in that direction, and could not be moved.\r\nAbigail Williams cried out, \"Set up Goody Nurse's head, the maid's neck\r\nwill be broke.\" Whereupon, some persons held the prisoner's head up,\r\nand \"Aaron Way observed that Betty Hubbard's was immediately righted.\"\r\nTo consummate the effect of the whole proceeding, Mr. Parris, by\r\ndirection of the magistrates, \"read what he had in characters taken\r\nfrom Mr. Thomas Putnam's wife in her fits.\" We shall come to the matter\r\nthus introduced by Mr. Parris, at a future stage of the story. It is\r\nsufficient here to say, that it contained the most positive and minute\r\ndeclarations that the apparition of Rebecca Nurse had appeared to her,\r\non several occasions, and horribly tortured her. After hearing Parris's\r\nstatement, Hathorne asked the prisoner, \"What do you think of this?\"\r\nHer reply was, \"I cannot help it: the Devil may appear in my shape.\" It\r\nmay be mentioned, that Mrs. Ann Putnam was present during this[ii.69]\r\nexamination, and, in the course of it, went into the most dreadful\r\nbodily agony, charging it on Rebecca Nurse. Her sufferings were so\r\nviolent, and held on so long, that the magistrates gave permission to\r\nher husband to carry her out of the meeting-house, to free her from the\r\nmalignant presence of the prisoner. The record of the examination\r\ncloses thus:—\r\n\r\n\"Salem Village, March 24th, 1691/2.—The Reverend Mr. Samuel Parris,\r\nbeing desired to take in writing the examination of Rebecca Nurse, hath\r\nreturned it as aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\"Upon hearing the aforesaid, and seeing what we then did see, together\r\nwith the charges of the persons then present, we committed Rebecca\r\nNurse, the wife of Francis Nurse of Salem Village, unto Her Majesty's\r\njail in Salem, as _per mittimus_ then given out, in order to further\r\nexamination.\"\r\n\r\nsignatures\r\n\r\nThe presence of Ann Putnam, the mother, on this occasion; the statement\r\nfrom her, read by Mr. Parris; and the terrible sufferings she\r\nexhibited, produced, no doubt, a deep effect upon the magistrates and\r\nall present. Her social position and personal appearance undoubtedly\r\ncontributed to heighten it. For two months, her house had been the\r\nconstant scene of the extraordinary actings of the circle of girls of\r\nwhich her daughter and maid-servant were the leading spirits.[ii.70]\r\nHer mind had been absorbed in the mysteries of spiritualism. The\r\nmarvels of necromancy and magic had been kept perpetually before it.\r\nShe had been living in the invisible world, with a constant sense of\r\nsupernaturalism surrounding her. Unconsciously, perhaps, the passions,\r\nprejudices, irritations, and animosities, to which she had been\r\nsubject, became mixed with the vagaries of an excited imagination; and,\r\nlaid open to the inroads of delusion as her mind had long been by\r\nperpetual tamperings with spiritual ideas and phantoms, she may have\r\nlost the balance of reason and sanity. This, added to a morbid\r\nsensibility, probably gave a deep intensity to her voice, action, and\r\ncountenance. The effect upon the excited multitude must have been very\r\ngreat. Although she lived to realize the utter falseness of all her\r\nstatements, her monstrous fictions were felt by her, at the time, to be\r\na reality.\r\n\r\nIn concluding his report of this examination, Mr. Parris says, \"By\r\nreason of great noises by the afflicted and many speakers, many things\r\nare pretermitted.\" He was probably quite willing to avoid telling the\r\nwhole story of the disgraceful and shocking scenes enacted in the\r\nmeeting-house that day. Deodat Lawson was present during the earlier\r\npart of the proceedings. He says that Mr. Hale began with prayer; that\r\nthe prisoner \"pleaded her innocency with earnestness;\" that, at the\r\nopening, some of the girls, Mary Walcot among them, declared that the\r\nprisoner had never hurt them. Presently, however, Mary Walcot screamed\r\nout that she was bitten, and charged[ii.71] it upon Rebecca Nurse. The\r\nmarks of teeth were produced on her wrist. Lawson says, \"It was so\r\ndisposed that I had not leisure to attend the whole time of\r\nexamination.\" The meaning is, I suppose, that he desired to withdraw\r\ninto the neighboring fields to con over his manuscript, and make\r\nhimself more able to perform with effect the part he was to act that\r\nafternoon. \"There was once,\" he says, \"such an hideous screech and\r\nnoise (which I heard as I walked at a little distance from the\r\nmeeting-house) as did amaze me; and some that were within told me the\r\nwhole assembly was struck with consternation, and they were afraid that\r\nthose that sat next to them were under the influence of witchcraft.\"\r\nThe whole congregation was in an uproar, every one afflicted by and\r\naffrighting every other, amid a universal outcry of terror and horror.\r\n\r\nAs it was a part of the policy of the managers of the business to\r\nutterly overwhelm the influence of all natural sentiment in the\r\ncommunity, they coupled with this proceeding against a venerable and\r\ninfirm great-grandmother, another of the same kind against a little\r\nchild. Immediately after the examination of Rebecca Nurse was\r\nconcluded, Dorcas, a daughter of Sarah Good, was brought before the\r\nmagistrates. She was between four and five years old. Lawson says, \"The\r\nchild looked hale and well as other children.\" A warrant had been\r\nissued for her apprehension, the day before, on complaint of Edward and\r\nJonathan Putnam. Herrick the marshal, who was a man that magnified his\r\noffice, and of much personal pride, did[ii.72] not, perhaps, fancy the\r\nidea of bringing up such a little prisoner; and he deputized the\r\noperation to Samuel Braybrook, who, the next morning, made return, in\r\ndue form, that \"he had taken the body of Dorcas Good,\" and sent her to\r\nthe house of Nathaniel Ingersoll, where she was in custody. It seems\r\nthat Braybrook did not like the job, and passed the handling of the\r\nchild over to still another. Whoever performed the service probably\r\nbrought her in his arms, or on a pillion. The little thing could not\r\nhave walked the distance from Benjamin Putnam's farm. When led in to be\r\nexamined, Ann Putnam, Mary Walcot, and Mercy Lewis, all charged her\r\nwith biting, pinching, and almost choking them. The two former went\r\nthrough their usual evolutions in the presence of the awe and terror\r\nstricken magistrates and multitude. They showed the marks of her little\r\nteeth on their arms; and the pins with which she pricked them were\r\nfound on their bodies, precisely where, in their shrieks, they had\r\naverred that she was piercing them. The evidence was considered\r\noverwhelming; and Dorcas was, _per mittimus_, committed to the jail,\r\nwhere she joined her mother. By the bill of the Boston jailer, it\r\nappears that they both were confined there: as they were too poor to\r\nprovide for themselves, \"the country\" was charged with ten shillings\r\nfor \"two blankets for Sarah Good's child.\" The mother, we know, was\r\nkept in chains; the child was probably chained too. Extraordinary\r\nfastenings, as has been stated, were thought necessary to hold a\r\nwitch.[ii.73]\r\n\r\nThere was no longer any doubt, in the mass of the community, that the\r\nDevil had effected a lodgement at Salem Village. Church-members,\r\npersons of all social positions, of the highest repute and profession\r\nof piety, eminent for visible manifestations of devotion, and of every\r\nage, had joined his standard, and become his active allies and\r\nconfederates.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these two examinations was unquestionably very great in\r\nspreading consternation and bewilderment far and wide; but they were\r\nonly the prelude to the work, to that end, arranged for the day. The\r\npublic mind was worked to red heat, and now was the moment to strike\r\nthe blow that would fix an impression deep and irremovable upon it. It\r\nwas Thursday, Lecture-day; and the public services usual on the\r\noccasion were to be held at the meeting-house.\r\n\r\nDeodat Lawson had arrived at the village on the 19th of March, and\r\nlodged at Deacon Ingersoll's. The fact at once became known; and Mary\r\nWalcot immediately went to the deacon's to see him. She had a fit on\r\nthe spot, which filled Lawson with amazement and horror. His turn of\r\nmind led him to be interested in such an excitement; and he had become\r\nadditionally and specially exercised by learning that the afflicted\r\npersons had intimated that the deaths of his wife and daughter, which\r\noccurred during his ministry at the village, had been brought about by\r\nthe diabolical agency of the persons then beginning to be unmasked, and\r\nbrought to justice. He was prepared to listen to the hints thus thrown\r\nout, and was ready to push[ii.74] the prosecutions on with an\r\nearnestness in which resentment and rage were mingled with the blindest\r\ncredulity. After Mary Walcot had given him a specimen of what the girls\r\nwere suffering, he walked over, early in the evening, to Mr. Parris's\r\nhouse; and there Abigail Williams went into the craziest\r\nmanifestations, throwing firebrands about the house in the presence of\r\nher uncle, rushing to the back of the chimney as though she would fly\r\nup through its wide flue, and performing many wonderful works. The next\r\nday being Sunday, he preached; and the services were interrupted, in\r\nthe manner already described, by the outbreaks of the afflicted, under\r\ndiabolic influence. The next day, he attended the examination of Martha\r\nCorey. On Wednesday, the 23d, he went up to Thomas Putnam's, as he\r\nsays, \"on purpose to see his wife.\" He \"found her lying on the bed,\r\nhaving had a sore fit a little before: her husband and she both desired\r\nme to pray with her while she was sensible, which I did, though the\r\napparition said I should not go to prayer. At the first beginning, she\r\nattended; but, after a little time, was taken with a fit, yet continued\r\nsilent, and seemed to be asleep.\" She had represented herself as being\r\nin conflict with the shape, or spectre, of a witch, which, she told\r\nLawson, said he should not pray on the occasion. But he courageously\r\nventured on the work. At the conclusion of the prayer, \"her husband,\r\ngoing to her, found her in a fit. He took her off the bed to sit her on\r\nhis knees; but at first she was so stiff she could not be bended, but\r\nshe after[ii.75]wards sat down.\" Then she went into that state of\r\nsupernatural vision and exaltation in which she was accustomed to utter\r\nthe wildest strains, in fervid, extravagant, but solemn and melancholy,\r\nrhapsodies: she disputed with the spectre about a text of Scripture,\r\nand then poured forth the most terrible denunciations upon it for\r\ntormenting and tempting her. She was evidently a very intellectual and\r\nimaginative woman, and was perfectly versed in all the imagery and\r\nlofty diction supplied by the prophetic and poetic parts of Scripture.\r\nAgain she was seized with a terrible fit, that lasted \"near half an\r\nhour.\" At times, her mouth was drawn on one side and her body strained.\r\nAt last she broke forth, and succeeded, after many violent struggles\r\nagainst the spectre and many convulsions of her frame, in saying what\r\npart of the Bible Lawson was to read aloud, in order to relieve her.\r\n\"It is,\" she said, \"the third chapter of the Revelation.\"—\"I did,\" says\r\nLawson, \"something scruple the reading it.\" He was loath to be engaged\r\nin an affair of that kind in which the Devil was an actor. At length he\r\novercame his scruples, and the effect was decisive. \"Before I had near\r\nread through the first verse, she opened her eyes, and was well.\"\r\nBewildered and amazed, he went back to Parris's house, and they talked\r\nover the awful manifestations of Satan's power. The next morning, he\r\nattended the examination of Rebecca Nurse, retiring from it, at an\r\nearly hour, to complete his preparation for the service that had been\r\narranged for him that afternoon.[ii.76]\r\n\r\nI say arranged, because the facts in this case prove long-concerted\r\narrangement. He was to preach a sermon that day. Word must have been\r\nsent to him weeks before. After reaching the village, every hour had\r\nbeen occupied in exciting spectacles and engrossing experiences,\r\nfilling his mind with the fanatical enthusiasm requisite to give force\r\nand fire to the delivery of the discourse. He could not possibly have\r\nwritten it after coming to the place. He must have brought it in his\r\npocket. It is a thoroughly elaborated and carefully constructed\r\nperformance, requiring long and patient application to compose it, and\r\nexhausting all the resources of theological research and reference, and\r\nof artistic skill and finish. It is adapted to the details of an\r\noccasion which was prepared to meet it. Not only the sermon but the\r\naudience were the result of arrangement carefully made in the stages of\r\npreparation and in the elements comprised in it. The preceding steps\r\nhad all been seasonably and appositely taken, so that, when the regular\r\nlecture afternoon came, Lawson would have his voluminous discourse\r\nready, and a congregation be in waiting to hear it, with minds suitably\r\nwrought upon by the preceding incidents of the day, to be thoroughly\r\nand permanently impressed by it. The occasion had been heralded by a\r\ntrain of circumstances drawing everybody to the spot. The magistrates\r\nwere already there, some of them by virtue of the necessity of official\r\npresence in the earlier part of the day, and others came in from the\r\nneighborhood; the ministers gathered from[ii.77] the towns in the\r\nvicinity; men and women came from all quarters, flocking along the\r\nhighways and the by-ways, large numbers on horseback, and crowds on\r\nfoot. Probably the village meeting-house, and the grounds around it,\r\npresented a spectacle such as never was exhibited elsewhere. Awe,\r\ndread, earnestness, a stern but wild fanaticism, were stamped on all\r\ncountenances, and stirred the heaving multitude to its depths, and in\r\nall its movements and utterances. It is impossible to imagine a\r\ncombination of circumstances that could give greater advantage and\r\npower to a speaker, and Lawson was equal to the situation. No discourse\r\nwas ever more equal, or better adapted, to its occasion. It was\r\nirresistible in its power, and carried the public mind as by storm.\r\n\r\nThe text is Zechariah, iii. 2: \"And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord\r\nrebuke thee, O Satan! even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke\r\nthee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?\" After an allusion\r\nto the rebellion of Satan, and his fall from heaven with his \"accursed\r\nlegions,\" and after representing them as filled \"with envy and malice\r\nagainst all mankind,\" seeking \"by all ways and means to work their ruin\r\nand destruction for ever, opposing to the utmost all persons and things\r\nappointed by the Lord Jesus Christ as means or instruments of their\r\ncomfort here or salvation hereafter,\" he proceeds, in the manner of\r\nthose days, to open his text and spread out his subject, all along\r\nexhibiting great ability, skill, and power, showing learning in his\r\nillustrations, draw[ii.78]ing aptly and abundantly from the Scriptures,\r\nand, at the right points, rising to high strains of eloquence in\r\ndiction and imagery.\r\n\r\nHe describes, at great length and with abundant instances ingeniously\r\nselected from sacred and profane literature, the marvellous power with\r\nwhich Satan is enabled to operate upon mankind. He says,—\r\n\r\n\"He is a spirit, and hence strikes at the spiritual part, the most\r\nexcellent (constituent) part of man. Primarily disturbing and\r\ninterrupting the animal and vital spirits, he maliciously operates upon\r\nthe more common powers of the soul by strange and frightful\r\nrepresentations to the fancy or imagination; and, by violent tortures\r\nof the body, often threatening to extinguish life, as hath been\r\nobserved in those that are afflicted amongst us. And not only so, but\r\nhe vents his malice in diabolical operations on the more sublime and\r\ndistinguishing faculties of the rational soul, raising mists of\r\ndarkness and ignorance in the understanding.... Sometimes he brings\r\ndistress upon the bodies of men, by malignant operations in, and\r\ndiabolical impressions on, the spirituous principle or vehicle of life\r\nand motion.... There are certainly some lower operations of Satan\r\n(whereof there are sundry examples among us), which the bodies and\r\nsouls of men and women are liable unto. And whosoever hath carefully\r\nobserved those things must needs be convinced, that the motions of the\r\npersons afflicted, both as to the manner and as to the violence of\r\nthem, are the mere effects of diabolical malice and operations, and\r\nthat it cannot rationally be imagined to proceed from any other cause\r\nwhatever.... Satan exerts his malice mediately by employing some of\r\nmankind and other creatures, and he frequently[ii.79] useth other\r\npersons or things, that his designs may be the more undiscernible. Thus\r\nhe used the serpent in the first temptation (Gen. iii. 1). Hence he\r\ncontracts and indents with witches and wizards, that they shall be the\r\ninstruments by whom he may more secretly affect and afflict the bodies\r\nand minds of others; and, if he can prevail upon those that make a\r\nvisible profession, it may be the better covert unto his diabolical\r\nenterprise, and may the more readily pervert others to consenting unto\r\nhis subjection. So far as we can look into those hellish mysteries, and\r\nguess at the administration of that kingdom of darkness, we may learn\r\nthat witches make witches by persuading one the other to subscribe to a\r\nbook or articles, &c.; and the Devil, having them in his subjection, by\r\ntheir consent, he will use their bodies and minds, shapes and\r\nrepresentations, to affright and afflict others at his pleasure, for\r\nthe propagation of his infernal kingdom, and accomplishing his devised\r\nmischiefs to the souls, bodies, and lives of the children of men, yea,\r\nand of the children of God too, so far as permitted and is possible....\r\nHe insinuates into the society of the adopted children of God, in their\r\nmost solemn approaches to him, in sacred ordinances, endeavoring to\r\nlook so like the true saints and ministers of Christ, that, if it were\r\npossible, he would deceive the very elect (Matt. xxiv. 24) by his\r\nsubtilty: for it is certain he never works more like the Prince of\r\ndarkness than when he looks most like an angel of light; and, when he\r\nmost pretends to holiness, he then doth most secretly, and by\r\nconsequence most surely, undermine it, and those that most excel in the\r\nexercise thereof.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is a specimen of the style in which he stirred up the\r\npeople:[ii.80]—\r\n\r\n\"The application of this doctrine to ourselves remains now to be\r\nattended. Let it be for solemn warning and awakening to all of us that\r\nare before the Lord at this time, and to all others of this whole\r\npeople, who shall come to the knowledge of these direful operations of\r\nSatan, which the holy God hath permitted in the midst of us.\r\n\r\n\"The Lord doth terrible things amongst us, by lengthening the chain of\r\nthe roaring lion in an extraordinary manner, so that the Devil is come\r\ndown in great wrath (Rev. xii. 12), endeavoring to set up his kingdom,\r\nand, by racking torments on the bodies, and affrightening\r\nrepresentations to the minds of many amongst us, to force and fright\r\nthem to become his subjects. I may well say, then, in the words of the\r\nprophet (Mic. vi. 9), 'The Lord's voice crieth to the city,' and to the\r\ncountry also, with an unusual and amazing loudness. Surely, it warns us\r\nto awaken out of all sleep, of security or stupidity, to arise, and\r\ntake our Bibles, turn to, and learn that lesson, not by rote only, but\r\nby heart. 1 Pet. v. 8: 'Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary\r\nthe Devil goes about as a roaring lion, seeking whom amongst you he may\r\ndistress, delude, and devour.'... Awake, awake then, I beseech you, and\r\nremain no longer under the dominion of that prince of cruelty and\r\nmalice, whose tyrannical fury we see thus exerted against the bodies\r\nand minds of these afflicted persons!... This warning is directed to\r\nall manner of persons, according to their condition of life, both in\r\ncivil and sacred order; both high and low, rich and poor, old and\r\nyoung, bond and free. Oh, let the observation of these amazing\r\ndispensations of God's unusual and strange Providence quicken us to our\r\nduty, at such a time as this, in our respective places and stations,\r\nrelations and capacities! The great God hath done such things amongst\r\nus as do[ii.81] make the ears of those that hear them to tingle (Jer.\r\nxix. 3); and serious souls are at a loss to what these things may grow,\r\nand what we shall find to be the end of this dreadful visitation, in\r\nthe permission whereof the provoked God as a lion hath roared, who can\r\nbut fear? the Lord hath spoken, who can but prophesy? (Amos iii. 8.)\r\nThe loud trumpet of God, in this thundering providence, is blown in the\r\ncity, and the echo of it heard through the country, surely then the\r\npeople must and ought to be afraid (Amos iii. 6).... You are therefore\r\nto be deeply humbled, and sit in the dust, considering the signal hand\r\nof God in singling out this place, this poor village, for the first\r\nseat of Satan's tyranny, and to make it (as 'twere) the rendezvous of\r\ndevils, where they muster their infernal forces; appearing to the\r\nafflicted as coming armed to carry on their malicious designs against\r\nthe bodies, and, if God in mercy prevent not, against the souls, of\r\nmany in this place.... Be humbled also that so many members of this\r\nchurch of the Lord Jesus Christ should be under the influences of\r\nSatan's malice in these his operations; some as the objects of his\r\ntyranny on their bodies to that degree of distress which none can be\r\nsensible of but those that see and feel it, who are in the mean time\r\nalso sorely distressed in their minds by frightful representations made\r\nby the devils unto them. Other professors and visible members of this\r\nchurch are under the awful accusations and imputations of being the\r\ninstruments of Satan in his mischievous actings. It cannot but be\r\nmatter of deep humiliation, to such as are innocent, that the righteous\r\nand holy God should permit them to be named in such pernicious and\r\nunheard-of practices, and not only so, but that he who cannot but do\r\nright should suffer the stain of suspected guilt to be, as it were,\r\nrubbed on and[ii.82] soaked in by many sore and amazing circumstances.\r\nAnd it is a matter of soul-abasement to all that are in the bond of\r\nGod's holy covenant in this place, that Satan's seat should be amongst\r\nthem, where he attempts to set up his kingdom in opposition to Christ's\r\nkingdom, and to take some of the visible subjects of our Lord Jesus,\r\nand use at least their shapes and appearances, instrumentally, to\r\nafflict and torture other visible subjects of the same kingdom. Surely\r\nhis design is that Christ's kingdom may be divided against itself,\r\nthat, being thereby weakened, he may the better take opportunity to set\r\nup his own accursed powers and dominions. It calls aloud then to all in\r\nthis place in the name of the blessed Jesus, and words of his holy\r\napostle (1 Peter v. 6), 'Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of\r\nGod.'\r\n\r\n\"It is matter of terror, amazement, and astonishment, to all such\r\nwretched souls (if there be any here in the congregation; and God, of\r\nhis infinite mercy, grant that none of you may ever be found such!) as\r\nhave given up their names and souls to the Devil; who by covenant,\r\nexplicit or implicit, have bound themselves to be his slaves and\r\ndrudges, consenting to be instruments in whose shapes he may torment\r\nand afflict their fellow-creatures (even of their own kind) to the\r\namazing and astonishing of the standers-by. I would hope I might have\r\nspared this use, but I desire (by divine assistance) to declare the\r\nwhole counsel of God; and if it come not as conviction where it is so,\r\nit may serve for warning, that it may never be so. For it is a most\r\ndreadful thing to consider that any should change the service of God\r\nfor the service of the Devil, the worship of the blessed God for the\r\nworship of the cursed enemy of God and man. But, oh! (which is yet a\r\nthousand times worse) how shall I name it? if any that are in the\r\nvisible covenant of[ii.83] God should break that covenant, and make a\r\nleague with Satan; if any that have sat down and eat at Christ's Table,\r\nshould so lift up their heel against him as to have fellowship at the\r\ntable of devils, and (as it hath been represented to some of the\r\nafflicted) eat of the bread and drink of the wine that Satan hath\r\nmingled. Surely, if this be so, the poet is in the right, \"Audax omnia\r\nperpeti. Gens humana ruit per vetitum nefas:\" audacious mortals are\r\ngrown to a fearful height of impiety; and we must cry out in Scripture\r\nlanguage, and that emphatical apostrophe of the Prophet Jeremy (chap.\r\nii. 12), 'Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid:\r\nbe ye very desolate, saith the Lord.'... If you are in covenant with\r\nthe Devil, the intercession of the blessed Jesus is against you. His\r\nprayer is for the subduing of Satan's power and kingdom, and the utter\r\nconfounding of all his instruments. If it be so, then the great God is\r\nset against you. The omnipotent Jehovah, one God in three Persons;\r\nFather, Son, and Holy Ghost, in their several distinct operations and\r\nall their divine attributes,—are engaged against you. Therefore know ye\r\nthat are guilty of such monstrous iniquity, that He that made you will\r\nnot save you, and that He that formed you will show you no favor (Isa.\r\nxxvii. 11). Be assured, that, although you should now evade the\r\ncondemnation of man's judgment, and escape a violent death by the hand\r\nof justice; yet, unless God shall give you repentance (which we\r\nheartily pray for), there is a day coming when the secrets of all\r\nhearts shall be revealed by Jesus Christ (Rom. ii. 16). Then, then,\r\nyour sin will find you out; and you shall be punished with everlasting\r\ndestruction from the presence of the Lord, and doomed to those endless,\r\neaseless, and remediless torments prepared for the Devil and his angels\r\n(Matt. xxv. 41).... If you[ii.84] have been guilty of such impiety, the\r\nprayers of the people of God are against you on that account. It is\r\ntheir duty to pray daily, that Satan's kingdom may be suppressed,\r\nweakened, brought down, and at last totally destroyed; hence that all\r\nabettors, subjects, defenders, and promoters thereof, may be utterly\r\ncrushed and confounded. They are constrained to suppress that kindness\r\nand compassion that in their sacred addresses they once bare unto you\r\n(as those of their own kind, and framed out of the same mould), praying\r\nwith one consent, as the royal prophet did against his malicious\r\nenemies, the instruments of Satan (Ps. cix. 6), 'Set thou a wicked man\r\nover him, and let Satan stand at his right hand' (i.e.), to withstand\r\nall that is for his good, and promote all that is for his hurt; and\r\n(verse 7) 'When he is judged, let him be condemned, and let his prayer\r\nbecome sin.'\r\n\r\n\"Be we exhorted and directed to exercise true spiritual sympathy with,\r\nand compassion towards, those poor, afflicted persons that are by\r\ndivine permission under the direful influence of Satan's malice. There\r\nis a divine precept enjoining the practice of such duty: Heb. xiii. 3,\r\n'Remember them that suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the\r\nbody.' Let us, then, be deeply sensible, and, as the elect of God, put\r\non bowels of mercy towards those in misery (Col. iii. 12). Oh, pity,\r\npity them! for the hand of the Lord hath touched them, and the malice\r\nof devils hath fallen upon them.\r\n\r\n\"Let us be sure to take unto us and put on the whole armor of God, and\r\nevery piece of it; let none be wanting. Let us labor to be in the\r\nexercise and practice of the whole company of sanctifying graces and\r\nreligious duties. This important duty is pressed, and the particular\r\npieces of that armor recited Eph. vi. 11 and 13 to 18. Satan is\r\nrepre[ii.85]senting his infernal forces; and the devils seem to come\r\narmed, mustering amongst us. I am this day commanded to call and cry an\r\nalarm unto you: Arm, arm, arm! handle your arms, see that you are fixed\r\nand in a readiness, as faithful soldiers under the Captain of our\r\nsalvation, that, by the shield of faith, ye and we all may resist the\r\nfiery darts of the wicked; and may be faithful unto death in our\r\nspiritual warfare; so shall we assuredly receive the crown of life\r\n(Rev. ii. 10). Let us admit no parley, give no quarter: let none of\r\nSatan's forces or furies be more vigilant to hurt us than we are to\r\nresist and repress them, in the name, and by the spirit, grace, and\r\nstrength of our Lord Jesus Christ. Let us ply the throne of grace, in\r\nthe name and merit of our Blessed Mediator, taking all possible\r\nopportunities, public, private, and secret, to pour out our\r\nsupplications to the God of our salvation. Prayer is the most proper\r\nand potent antidote against the old Serpent's venomous operations. When\r\nlegions of devils do come down among us, multitudes of prayers should\r\ngo up to God. Satan, the worst of all our enemies, is called in\r\nScripture a dragon, to note his malice; a serpent, to note his\r\nsubtilty; a lion, to note his strength. But none of all these can stand\r\nbefore prayer. The most inveterate malice (as that of Haman) sinks\r\nunder the prayer of Esther (chap. iv. 16). The deepest policy (the\r\ncounsel of Achitophel) withers before the prayer of David (2 Sam. xv.\r\n31); and the vastest army (an host of a thousand thousand Ethiopians)\r\nran away, like so many cowards, before the prayer of Asa (2 Chron. xiv.\r\n9 to 15).\r\n\r\n\"What therefore I say unto one I say unto all, in this important case,\r\nPray, pray, pray.\r\n\r\n\"To our honored magistrates, here present this day, to[ii.86] inquire\r\ninto these things, give me leave, much honored, to offer one word to\r\nyour consideration. Do all that in you lies to check and rebuke Satan;\r\nendeavoring, by all ways and means that are according to the rule of\r\nGod, to discover his instruments in these horrid operations. You are\r\nconcerned in the civil government of this people, being invested with\r\npower by their Sacred Majesties, under this glorious Jesus (the King\r\nand Governor of his church), for the supporting of Christ's kingdom\r\nagainst all oppositions of Satan's kingdom and his instruments. Being\r\nordained of God to such a station (Rom. xiii. 1), we entreat you, bear\r\nnot the sword in vain, as ver. 4; but approve yourselves a terror of\r\nand punishment to evil-doers, and a praise to them that do well (1\r\nPeter ii. 14); ever remembering that ye judge not for men, but for the\r\nLord (2 Chron. xix. 6); and, as his promise is, so our prayer shall be\r\nfor you, without ceasing, that he would be with you in the judgment, as\r\nhe that can and will direct, assist, and reward you. Follow the example\r\nof the upright Job (chap. xxix. 16): Be a father to the poor; to these\r\npoor afflicted persons, in pitiful and painful endeavors to help them;\r\nand the cause that seems to be so dark, as you know not how to\r\ndetermine it, do your utmost, in the use of all regular means, to\r\nsearch it out.\r\n\r\n\"There is comfort in considering that the Lord Jesus, the Captain of\r\nour salvation, hath already overcome the Devil. Christ, that blessed\r\nseed of the woman, hath given this cursed old serpent called the Devil\r\nand Satan a mortal and incurable bruise on the head (Gen. iii. 15). He\r\nwas too much for him in a single conflict (Matt. iv.). He opposed his\r\npower and kingdom in the possessed. He suffered not the devils to\r\nspeak, because they knew him (Mark i. 34). He com[ii.87]pleted his\r\nvictory by his death on the cross, and destroyed his dominion (Heb. ii.\r\n14), that through death he might destroy death, and him that had the\r\npowers of death, that is the Devil; and by and after his resurrection\r\nmade show openly unto the world, that he had spoiled principalities and\r\npowers, triumphing over them (Col. ii. 15). Hence, if we are by faith\r\nunited to him, his victory is an earnest and prelibation of our\r\nconquest at last. All Satan's strugglings now are but those of a\r\nconquered enemy. It is no small comfort to consider, that Job's\r\nexercise of patience had its beginning from the Devil; but we have seen\r\nthe end to be from the Lord (James v. 11). That we also may find by\r\nexperience the same blessed issue of our present distresses by Satan's\r\nmalice, let us repent of every sin that hath been committed, and labor\r\nto practise every duty which hath been neglected. Then we shall\r\nassuredly and speedily find that the kingly power of our Lord and\r\nSaviour shall be magnified, in delivering his poor sheep and lambs out\r\nof the jaws and paws of the roaring lion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Stoughton\r\n\r\nWILLIAM STOUGHTON.\r\n_Eng.d at J. Andrews's by R. Babson_\r\n\r\n\r\nThese extended extracts are given from Lawson's discourse, partly to\r\nenable every one to estimate the effect it must have produced, under\r\nthe circumstances of the occasion, but mainly because they present a\r\nliving picture of the sentiments, notions, modes of thinking and\r\nreasoning, and convictions, then prevalent. No description given by a\r\nperson looking back from our point of view, not having experienced the\r\ndelusions of that age, no matter who might attempt the task, could\r\nadequately paint the scene. The foregoing extracts show better, I\r\nthink, than any documents that have come down to us, how the subject\r\nlay[ii.88] in the minds of men at that time. They bring before us\r\ndirectly, without the intervention of any secondary agency, the\r\nthoughts, associations, sentiments, of that generation, in breathing\r\nreality. They carry us back to the hour and to the spot. Deodat Lawson\r\nrises from his unknown grave, comes forth from the impenetrable cloud\r\nwhich enveloped the closing scenes of his mortal career, and we listen\r\nto his voice, as it spoke to the multitudes that gathered in and around\r\nthe meeting-house in Salem Village, on Lecture-day, March 24, 1692. He\r\nlays bare his whole mind to our immediate inspection. In and through\r\nhim, we behold the mind and heart, the forms of language and thought,\r\nthe feelings and passions, of the people of that day. We mingle with\r\nthe crowd that hang upon his lips; we behold their countenances,\r\ndiscern the passions that glowed upon their features, and enter into\r\nthe excitement that moved and tossed them like a tempest. We are thus\r\nprepared, as we could be in no other way, to comprehend our story.\r\n\r\nThe sermon answered its end. It re-enforced the powers that had begun\r\ntheir work. It spread out the whole doctrine of witchcraft in a\r\nmethodical, elaborate, and most impressive form. It justified and\r\ncommended every thing that had been done, and every thing that remained\r\nto be done; every step in the proceedings; every process in the\r\nexaminations; every kind of accusation and evidence that had been\r\nadduced; every phase of the popular belief, however wild and monstrous;\r\nevery pretension of the afflicted children[ii.89] to preternatural\r\nexperiences and communications, and every tale of apparitions of\r\ndeparted spirits and the ghosts of murdered men, women, and children,\r\nwhich, engendered in morbid and maniac imaginations, had been employed\r\nto fill him and others with horror, inspire revenge, and drive on the\r\ngeneral delirium. And it fortified every point by the law and the\r\ntestimony, by passages and scraps of Scripture, studiously and\r\nskilfully culled out, and ingeniously applied. It gave form to what had\r\nbeen vague, and authority to what had floated in blind and baseless\r\ndreams of fancy. It crystallized the disordered vagaries, that had been\r\nseething in turbulent confusion in the public mind, into a fixed,\r\norganized, and permanent shape.\r\n\r\nIts publication was forthwith called for. The manuscript was submitted\r\nto Increase and Cotton Mather of the North, James Allen and John Bailey\r\nof the First, Samuel Willard of the Old South, churches in Boston, and\r\nCharles Morton of the church in Charlestown. It was printed with a\r\nstrong, unqualified indorsement of approval, signed by the names\r\nseverally of these the most eminent divines of the country. The\r\ndiscourse was dedicated to the \"worshipful and worthily honored\r\nBartholomew Gedney, John Hathorne, Jonathan Corwin, Esqrs., together\r\nwith the reverend Mr. John Higginson, pastor, and Mr. Nicholas Noyes,\r\nteacher, of the Church of Christ at Salem,\" with a preface, addressed\r\nto all his \"Christian friends and acquaintance, the inhabitants of\r\nSalem Village.\" It was republished in London in 1704, under the\r\nimmediate direction of its[ii.90] author. The subject is described as\r\n\"Christ's Fidelity, the only Shield against Satan's Malignity;\" and the\r\ntitlepage is enforced by passages of Scripture (Rev. xii. 12, and Rom.\r\nxvi. 20). The interest of the volume is highly increased by an\r\nappendix, giving the substance of notes taken by Lawson on the spot,\r\nduring the examinations and trials. They are invaluable, as proceeding\r\nfrom a chief actor in the scenes, who was wholly carried away by the\r\ndelusion. They describe, in marvellous colors, the wonderful\r\nmanifestations of diabolical agency in, upon, and through the afflicted\r\nchildren; resembling, in many respects, reports of spiritual\r\ncommunications prevalent in our day, although not quite coming up to\r\nthem. These statements, and the preface to the discourse, are given in\r\nthe Appendix to this volume. In a much briefer form, it was printed by\r\nBenjamin Harris, at Boston, in 1692; and soon after by John Dunton, in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nBefore dismissing Mr. Lawson's famous sermon, our attention is demanded\r\nto a remarkable paragraph in it. His strong faculties could not be\r\nwholly bereft of reason; and he had sense enough left to see, what does\r\nnot appear to have occurred to others, that there might be a re-action\r\nin the popular passions, and that some might be called to account by an\r\nindignant public, if not before a stern tribunal of justice, for the\r\ncourse of cruelty and outrage they were pursuing, with so high a hand,\r\nagainst accused persons. He was not entirely satisfied that the appeal\r\nhe made in his discourse to[ii.91] the people to suppress and crush out\r\nall vestiges of human feeling, and to stifle compassion and pity in\r\ntheir breasts, would prevail. He foresaw that the friends and families\r\nof innocent and murdered victims might one day call for vengeance; and\r\nhe attempts to provide, beforehand, a defence that is truly ingenious:—\r\n\r\n\"Give no place to the Devil by rash censuring of others, without\r\nsufficient grounds, or false accusing any willingly. This is indeed to\r\nbe like the Devil, who hath the title, Διαβολος, in the Greek, because\r\nhe is the calumniator or false accuser. Hence, when we read of such\r\naccusers in the latter days, they are, in the original, called\r\nΔιαβολοι, _calumniatores_ (2 Tim. iii. 3). It is a time of temptation\r\namongst you, such as never was before: let me entreat you not to be\r\nlavish or severe in reflecting on the malice or envy of your neighbors,\r\nby whom any of you have been accused, lest, whilst you falsely charge\r\none another,—viz., the relations of the afflicted and relations of the\r\naccused,—the grand accuser (who loves to fish in troubled waters)\r\nshould take advantage upon you. Look at sin, the procuring cause; God\r\nin justice, the sovereign efficient; and Satan, the enemy, the\r\nprincipal instrument, both in afflicting some and accusing others. And,\r\nif innocent persons be suspected, it is to be ascribed to God's\r\npleasure, supremely permitting, and Satan's malice subordinately\r\ntroubling, by representation of such to the afflicting of others, even\r\nof such as have, all the while, we have reason to believe (especially\r\nsome of them), no kind of ill-will or disrespect unto those that have\r\nbeen complained of by them. This giving place to the Devil avoid; for\r\nit will have uncomforta[ii.92]ble and pernicious influence upon the\r\naffairs of this place, by letting out peace, and bringing in confusion\r\nand every evil work, which we heartily pray God, in mercy, to prevent.\"\r\n\r\nThis artifice of statement, speciously covered,—while it outrages every\r\nsentiment of natural justice, and breaks every bond of social\r\nresponsibility,—is found, upon close inspection, to be a shocking\r\nimputation against the divine administration. It represents the Deity,\r\nunder the phrases \"sovereign efficient\" and \"supremely permitting\" in a\r\nview which affords equal shelter to every other class of criminals,\r\neven of the deepest dye, as well as those who were ready and eager to\r\nbring upon their neighbors the charge of confederacy with Satan.\r\n\r\nThe next Sunday—March 27—was the regular communion-day of the village\r\nchurch; and Mr. Parris prepared duly to improve the occasion to advance\r\nthe movement then so strongly under way, and to deepen still more the\r\nimpression made by the events of the week, especially by Mr. Lawson's\r\nsermon. He accordingly composed an elaborate and effective discourse of\r\nhis own; and a scene was arranged to follow the regular service, which\r\ncould not but produce important results. An unexpected occurrence—a\r\npart not in the programme—took place, which created a sensation for the\r\nmoment; but it tended, upon the whole, to heighten the public\r\nexcitement, and, without much disturbing the order, only precipitated a\r\nlittle the progress of events.[ii.93]\r\n\r\nIt may well be supposed, that the congregation assembled that day with\r\nminds awfully solemnized, and altogether in a condition to be deeply\r\naffected by the services. A respectable person always prominently\r\nnoticeable for her devout participation in the worship of the\r\nsanctuary, and a member of the church, had, on Monday, after a public\r\nexamination, been committed to prison, and was there in irons, waiting\r\nto be tried for her life for the blackest of crimes,—a confederacy with\r\nthe enemy of the souls of men, the archtraitor and rebel against the\r\nthrone of God. On Thursday, another venerable, and ever before\r\nconsidered pious, matron of a large and influential family, a\r\nparticipant in their worship, and a member of the mother-church, had\r\nbeen consigned to the same fate, to be tried for the same horrible\r\ncrime. A little child had been proved to have also joined in the\r\ninfernal league. No one could tell to what extent Satan had lengthened\r\nhis chain, or who, whether old or young, were in league with him. Every\r\nsoul was still alive to the impressions made by Mr. Lawson's great\r\ndiscourse, and by the throngs of excited people, including magistrates\r\nand ministers, that had been gathered in the village.\r\n\r\nThe character and spirit of Mr. Parris's sermon are indicated in a\r\nprefatory note in the manuscript, \"occasioned by dreadful witchcraft\r\nbroke out here a few weeks past; and one member of this church, and\r\nanother of Salem, upon public examination by civil authority,\r\nvehemently suspected for she-witches.\" The running[ii.94] title is,\r\n\"Christ knows how many devils there are in his church, and who they\r\nare;\" and the text is John vi. 70, 71, \"Jesus answered them, Have not I\r\nchosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? He spake of Judas\r\nIscariot, the son of Simon; for he it was that should betray him, being\r\none of the twelve.\"\r\n\r\nPeter Cloyse was born May 27, 1639. He came to Salem from York, in\r\nMaine, and was one of the original members of the village church. He\r\nappears to have been a person of the greatest respectability and\r\nstrength of character. He married Sarah, sister of Rebecca Nurse, and\r\nwidow of Edmund Bridges. She was admitted to the village church, Jan.\r\n12, 1690, being then about forty-eight years of age. It may well be\r\nsupposed that she and her family were overwhelmed with affliction and\r\nhorror by the proceedings against her sister. But, as she and her\r\nhusband were both communicants, and it was sacrament-day, it was\r\nthought best for them to summon resolution to attend the service. After\r\nmuch persuasion, she was induced to go. She was a very sensitive\r\nperson, and it must have required a great effort of fortitude. Her mind\r\nwas undoubtedly much harrowed by the allusions made to the events of\r\nthe week; and, when Mr. Parris announced his text, and opened his\r\ndiscourse in the spirit his language indicates, she could bear it no\r\nlonger, but rose, and left the meeting. A fresh wind blowing at the\r\ntime caused the door to slam after her. The congregation was probably\r\nstartled; but Parris was not long embarrassed by the interruption,\r\nand[ii.95] she was attended to in due season. At the close of the\r\nservice, the following scene occurred. I give it as Parris describes it\r\nin his church-record book:—\r\n\r\n\"After the common auditory was dismissed, and before the church's\r\ncommunion at the Lord's Table, the following testimony against the\r\nerror of our Sister Mary Sibley, who had given direction to my Indian\r\nman in an unwarrantable way to find out witches, was read by the\r\npastor:—\r\n\r\n\"It is altogether undeniable that our great and blessed God, for wise\r\nand holy ends, hath suffered many persons, in several families, of this\r\nlittle village, to be grievously vexed and tortured in body, and to be\r\ndeeply tempted, to the endangering of the destruction of their souls;\r\nand all these amazing feats (well known to many of us) to be done by\r\nwitchcraft and diabolical operations. It is also well known, that, when\r\nthese calamities first began, which was in my own family, the\r\naffliction was several weeks before such hellish operations as\r\nwitchcraft were suspected. Nay, it was not brought forth to any\r\nconsiderable light, until diabolical means were used by the making of a\r\ncake by my Indian man, who had his direction from this our sister, Mary\r\nSibley; since which, apparitions have been plenty, and exceeding much\r\nmischief hath followed. But, by these means (it seems), the Devil hath\r\nbeen raised amongst us, and his rage is vehement and terrible; and,\r\nwhen he shall be silenced, the Lord only knows. But now that this our\r\nsister should be instrumental to such distress is a great grief to\r\nmyself, and our godly honored and reverend neighbors, who have had the\r\nknowledge of it. Nevertheless, I do truly hope and believe, that this\r\nour sister doth truly[ii.96] fear the Lord; and I am well satisfied\r\nfrom her, that, what she did, she did it ignorantly, from what she had\r\nheard of this nature from other ignorant or worse persons. Yet we are\r\nin duty bound to protest against such actions, as being indeed a going\r\nto the Devil for help against the Devil: we having no such directions\r\nfrom nature, or God's word, it must therefore be, and is, accounted, by\r\ngodly Protestants who write or speak of such matters, as diabolical;\r\nand therefore calls this our sister to deep humiliation for what she\r\nhas done, and all of us to be watchful against Satan's wiles and\r\ndevices.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore, as we, in duty as a church of Christ, are deeply bound to\r\nprotest against it, as most directly contrary to the gospel, yet,\r\ninasmuch as this our sister did it in ignorance as she professeth and\r\nwe believe, we can continue her in our holy fellowship, upon her\r\nserious promise of future better advisedness and caution, and\r\nacknowledging that she is indeed sorrowful for her rashness herein.\r\n\r\n\"Brethren, if this be your mind, that this iniquity should be thus\r\nborne witness against, manifest it by your usual sign of lifting up\r\nyour hands.—The brethren voted generally, or universally: none made any\r\nexceptions.\r\n\r\n\"Sister Sibley, if you are convinced that you herein did sinfully, and\r\nare sorry for it, let us hear it from your own mouth.—She did manifest\r\nto satisfaction her error and grief for it.\r\n\r\n\"Brethren, if herein you have received satisfaction, testify it by\r\nlifting up your hands.—A general vote passed; no exception made.\r\n\r\n\"Note.—25th March, 1692. I discoursed said sister in my study about her\r\ngrand error aforesaid, and also then read to her what I had written as\r\nabove to be read to the[ii.97] church; and said Sister Sibley assented\r\nto the same with tears and sorrowful confession.\"\r\n\r\nThis proceeding was of more importance than appears, perhaps, at first\r\nview. It was one of Mr. Parris's most skilful moves. The course,\r\npursued by the \"afflicted\" persons had, thus far, in reference to those\r\nengaged in the prosecutions, been in the right direction. But it was\r\nmanifest, after the exhibitions they had given, that they wielded a\r\nfearful power, too fearful to be left without control. They could cry\r\nout upon whomsoever they pleased; and against their accusations, armed\r\nas they were with the power to fix the charge of guilt upon any one by\r\ngiving ocular demonstration that he or she was the author of their\r\nsufferings, there could be no defence. They might turn, at any moment,\r\nand cry out upon Parris or Lawson, or either or both of the deacons.\r\nNothing could withstand the evidence of their fits, convulsions, and\r\ntortures. It was necessary to have and keep them under safe control,\r\nand, to this end, to prevent any outsiders, or any injudicious or\r\nintermeddling people, from holding intimacy with them. Parris saw this,\r\nand, with his characteristic boldness of action and fertility of\r\nresources, at once put a stop to all trouble, and closed the door\r\nagainst danger, from this quarter.\r\n\r\nSamuel Sibley was a member of the church, and a near neighbor of Mr.\r\nParris. He was about thirty-six years of age. His wife Mary was\r\nthirty-two years of age, and also a member of the church. They[ii.98]\r\nwere persons of respectable standing and good repute. Nothing is known\r\nto her disadvantage, but her foolish connection with the mystical\r\noperations going on in Mr. Parris's family; and of this she was\r\nheartily ashamed. Her penitent sensibility is quite touchingly\r\ndescribed by Mr. Parris. It is true that what she had done was a trifle\r\nin comparison with what was going on every day in the families of Mr.\r\nParris and Thomas Putnam: but she had acted \"rashly,\" without\r\n\"advisedness\" from the right quarter, under the lead of \"ignorant\r\npersons;\" and therefore it was necessary to make a great ado about it,\r\nand hold her up as a warning to prevent other persons from meddling in\r\nsuch matters. Her husband was an uncle of Mary Walcot, one of the\r\nafflicted children; and it was particularly important to keep their\r\nrelatives, and members of their immediate families, from taking any\r\npart or action in connection with them, except under due \"advisedness,\"\r\nand the direction of persons learned in such deep matters. The family\r\nconnections of the Sibleys were extensive, and a blow struck at that\r\npoint would be felt everywhere. The procedure was undoubtedly\r\neffectual. After Mary Sibley had been thus awfully rebuked and\r\ndistressingly exposed for dealing with \"John Indian,\" it is not likely\r\nthat any one else ever ventured to intermeddle with the \"afflicted,\" or\r\nhave any connection, except as outside spectators, with the marvellous\r\nphenomena of \"diabolical operations.\" It will be noticed, that, while\r\nMr. Parris thus waved the sword of disciplinary[ii.99] vengeance\r\nagainst any who should dare to intrude upon the forbidden ground, he\r\noccupied it himself without disguise, and maintained his hold upon it.\r\nHe asserts the reality of the \"amazing feats\" practised by diabolical\r\npower in their midst, and enforces in the strongest language the then\r\nprevalent views and pending proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the week, including the solemn censure of Mary\r\nSibley, had all worked favorably for the prosecutors and managers of\r\nthe business. The magistrates, ministers, and whole body of the people,\r\nhad become committed; the accusing girls had proved themselves apt and\r\ncompetent to their work; the public reason was prostrated, and natural\r\nsensibility stunned. All resisting forces were powerless, and all\r\ncollateral dangers avoided and provided against. The movement was fully\r\nin hand. The next step was maturely considered, and, as we shall see,\r\nskilfully taken.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, that there was, at this time, a break in the\r\nregular government of Massachusetts. In the spring of 1689, the people\r\nhad risen, seized the royal governor, Sir Edmund Andros, and put him in\r\nprison. They summoned their old charter governor, Simon Bradstreet,\r\nthen living in Salem, eighty-seven years of age, to the chair of state;\r\ncalled the assistants of 1686 back to their seats, who provided for an\r\nelection of representatives by the people of the towns; and the\r\ngovernment thus created conducted affairs until the arrival of Sir\r\nWilliam Phipps, in May, 1692, when Massachusetts ceased to be a[ii.100]\r\ncolony, and was thenceforth, until 1774, a royal province. During these\r\nthree years, from May, 1689, to May, 1692, the government was based\r\nupon an uprising of the people. It was a period of pure and absolute\r\nindependence of the crown or parliament of England. Although\r\nBradstreet's faculties were unimpaired and his spirit true and firm,\r\nhis age prevented his doing much more than to give his loved and\r\nvenerated name to the daring movement, and to the official service, of\r\nthe people. The executive functions were, for the most part, exercised\r\nby the deputy-governor, Thomas Danforth, who was a person of great\r\nability and public spirit. Unfortunately, at this time he was zealously\r\nin favor of the witchcraft prosecutions. Bradstreet was throughout\r\nopposed to them. Had time held off its hand, and his physical energies\r\nnot been impaired, he would undoubtedly have resisted and prevented\r\nthem. Danforth, it is said by Brattle, came to disapprove of them\r\nfinally: but he began them by arrests in other towns, months before any\r\nthing of the kind was thought of in Salem Village; and he contributed,\r\nprominently, to give destructive and wide-spread power, in an early\r\nstage of its development, to the witchcraft delusion here.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of a week, preparations were completed to renew\r\noperations, and a higher and more commanding character given to them.\r\nOn Monday, April 4, Captain Jonathan Walcot and Lieutenant Nathaniel\r\nIngersoll went to the town, and, \"for themselves and several of their\r\nneighbors,\" exhibited to the assistants[ii.101] residing there, John\r\nHathorne and Jonathan Corwin, complaints against \"Sarah Cloyse, the\r\nwife of Peter Cloyse of Salem Village, and Elizabeth Procter of Salem\r\nFarms, for high suspicion of sundry acts of witchcraft.\" There the plan\r\nof proceedings in reference to the above-said parties was agreed upon.\r\nIt was the result of consultation; communications probably passing with\r\nthe deputy-governor in Boston, or at his residence in Cambridge. On the\r\n8th of April, warrants were duly issued, ordering the marshal to bring\r\nin the prisoners \"on Monday morning next, being the eleventh day of\r\nthis instant April, about eleven of the clock, in the public\r\nmeeting-house in the town.\" It had been arranged, that the examination\r\nshould not be, as before, in the ordinary way, before the two local\r\nmagistrates, but, in an extraordinary way, before the highest tribunal\r\nin the colony, or a representation of it. For a preliminary hearing,\r\nwith a view merely to commitment for trial, this surely may justly be\r\ncharacterized as an extraordinary, wholly irregular, and, in all points\r\nof view, reprehensible procedure. When the day came, the meeting-house,\r\nwhich was much more capacious than that at the village, was crowded;\r\nand the old town filled with excited throngs. Upon opening proceedings,\r\nlo and behold, instead of the two magistrates, the government of the\r\ncolony was present, in the highest character it then had as \"a\r\ncouncil\"! The record says,—\r\n\r\n\"Salem, April 11, 1692.—At a Council held at Salem, and present Thomas\r\nDanforth, Esq., deputy-governor;[ii.102] James Russell, John Hathorne,\r\nIsaac Addington, Major Samuel Appleton, Captain Samuel Sewall, Jonathan\r\nCorwin, Esquires.\"\r\n\r\nRussell was of Charlestown, Addington and Sewall of Boston, and\r\nAppleton of Ipswich. Mr. Parris, \"being desired and appointed to write\r\nthe examination, did take the same, and also read it before the council\r\nin public.\" This document has not come down to us; but Hutchinson had\r\naccess to it, and the substance of it is preserved in his \"History of\r\nMassachusetts.\"\r\n\r\nThe marshal (Herrick) brought in Sarah Cloyse and Elizabeth Procter,\r\nand delivered them \"before the honorable council:\" and the examination\r\nwas begun.\r\n\r\nThe deputy-governor first called to the stand John Indian, and plied\r\nhim, as was the course pursued on all these occasions, with leading\r\nquestions:—\r\n\r\n\"John, who hurt you?—Goody Procter first, and then Goody Cloyse.\r\n\r\n\"What did she do to you?—She brought the book to me.\r\n\r\n\"John, tell the truth: who hurts you? Have you been hurt?—The first was\r\na gentlewoman I saw.\r\n\r\n\"Who next?—Goody Cloyse.\r\n\r\n\"But who hurt you next?—Goody Procter.\r\n\r\n\"What did she do to you?—She choked me, and brought the book.\r\n\r\n\"How oft did she come to torment you?—A good many times, she and Goody\r\nCloyse.[ii.103]\r\n\r\n\"Do they come to you in the night, as well as the day?—They come most\r\nin the day.\r\n\r\n\"Who?—Goody Cloyse and Goody Procter.\r\n\r\n\"Where did she take hold of you?—Upon my throat, to stop my breath.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know Goody Cloyse and Goody Procter?—Yes: here is Goody\r\nCloyse.\"\r\n\r\nWe may well suppose that these two respectable women must have been\r\nfilled with indignation, shocked, and amazed at the statements made by\r\nthe Indian, following the leading interrogatories of the Court. Sarah\r\nCloyse broke out, \"When did I hurt thee?\" He answered, \"A great many\r\ntimes.\" She exclaimed, \"Oh, you are a grievous liar!\" The Court\r\nproceeded with their questions:—\r\n\r\n\"What did this Goody Cloyse do to you?—She pinched and bit me till the\r\nblood came.\r\n\r\n\"How long since this woman came and hurt you?—Yesterday, at meeting.\r\n\r\n\"At any time before?—Yes: a great many times.\"\r\n\r\nHaving drawn out John Indian, the Court turned to the other afflicted\r\nones:—\r\n\r\n\"Mary Walcot, who hurts you?—Goody Cloyse.\r\n\r\n\"What did she do to you?—She hurt me.\r\n\r\n\"Did she bring the book?—Yes.\r\n\r\n\"What was you to do with it?—To touch it, and be well.\r\n\r\n\"(Then she fell into a fit.)\"\r\n\r\nThis put a stop to the examination for a time; but it was generally\r\nquite easy to bring witnesses out of a[ii.104] fit, and restore entire\r\ncalmness of mind. All that was necessary was to lift them up, and carry\r\nthem to the accused person, the touch of any part of whose body would,\r\nin an instant, relieve the sufferer. This having been done, the\r\nexamination proceeded:—\r\n\r\n\"Doth she come alone?—Sometimes alone, and sometimes in company with\r\nGoody Nurse and Goody Corey, and a great many I do not know.\r\n\r\n\"(Then she fell into a fit again.)\"\r\n\r\nShe was, probably, restored in the same way as before; but, her part\r\nbeing finished for that stage of the proceeding, another of the\r\nafflicted children took the stand:—\r\n\r\n\"Abigail Williams, did you see a company at Mr. Parris's house eat and\r\ndrink?—Yes, sir: that was in the sacrament.\"\r\n\r\nI would call attention to the form of the foregoing questions.\r\nHutchinson says that \"Mr. Parris was over-officious: most of the\r\nexaminations, although in the presence of one or more magistrates, were\r\ntaken by him.\" He put the questions. They show, on this occasion, a\r\nminute knowledge beforehand of what the witnesses are to say, which it\r\ncannot be supposed Danforth, Russell, Addington, Appleton, and Sewall,\r\nstrangers, as they were, to the place and the details of the affair,\r\ncould have had. The examination proceeded:—\r\n\r\n\"How many were there?—About forty, and Goody Cloyse and Goody Good were\r\ntheir deacons.[ii.105]\r\n\r\n\"What was it?—They said it was our blood, and they had it twice that\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\nThe interrogator again turned to Mary Walcot, and inquired,—\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen a white man?—Yes, sir: a great many times.\r\n\r\n\"What sort of a man was he?—A fine grave man; and, when he came, he\r\nmade all the witches to tremble.\r\n\r\n\"(Abigail Williams confirmed the same, and that they had such a sight\r\nat Deacon Ingersoll's.)\r\n\r\n\"Who was at Deacon Ingersoll's then?—Goody Cloyse, Goody Nurse, Goody\r\nCorey, and Goody Good.\r\n\r\n\"(Then Sarah Cloyse asked for water, and sat down, as one seized with a\r\ndying, fainting fit; and several of the afflicted fell into fits, and\r\nsome of them cried out, 'Oh! her spirit has gone to prison to her\r\nsister Nurse.')\"\r\n\r\nThe audacious lying of the witnesses; the horrid monstrousness of their\r\ncharges against Sarah Cloyse, of having bitten the flesh of the Indian\r\nbrute, and drank herself and distributed to others, as deacon, at an\r\ninfernal sacrament, the blood of the wicked creatures making these foul\r\nand devilish declarations, known by her to be utterly and wickedly\r\nfalse; and the fact that they were believed by the deputy, the council,\r\nand the assembly,—were more than she could bear. Her soul sickened at\r\nsuch unimaginable depravity and wrong; her nervous system gave way; she\r\nfainted, and sunk to the floor. The manner in which the girls turned\r\nthe incident against her shows how they were hardened to all human\r\nfeeling, and the[ii.106] cunning art which, on all occasions,\r\ncharacterized their proceedings. That such an insolent interruption and\r\ndisturbance, on their part, was permitted, without rebuke from the\r\nCourt, is a perpetual dishonor to every member of it. The scene\r\nexhibited at this moment, in the meeting-house, is worthy of an attempt\r\nto imagine. The most terrible sensation was naturally produced, by the\r\nswooning of the prisoner, the loudly uttered and savage mockery of the\r\ngirls, and their going simultaneously into fits, screaming at the top\r\nof their voices, twisting into all possible attitudes, stiffened as in\r\ndeath, or gasping with convulsive spasms of agony, and crying out, at\r\nintervals, \"There is the black man whispering in Cloyse's ear,\" \"There\r\nis a yellow-bird flying round her head.\" John Indian, on such\r\noccasions, used to confine his achievements to tumbling, and rolling\r\nhis ugly body about the floor. The deepest commiseration was felt by\r\nall for the \"afflicted,\" and men and women rushed to hold and soothe\r\nthem. There was, no doubt, much loud screeching, and some miscellaneous\r\nfaintings, through the whole crowd. At length, by bringing the\r\nsufferers into contact with Goody Cloyse, the diabolical fluid passed\r\nback into her, they were all relieved, and the examination was resumed.\r\nElizabeth Procter was now brought forward.\r\n\r\nIn the account given, in the First Part, of the population of Salem\r\nVillage and the contiguous farms, her husband, John Procter, was\r\nintroduced to our acquaintance. From what we then saw of him, we are\r\nwell assured that he would not shrink from the protec[ii.107]tion and\r\ndefence of his wife. He accompanied her from her arrest to her\r\narraignment, and stood by her side, a strong, brave, and resolute\r\nguardian, trying to support her under the terrible trials of her\r\nsituation, and ready to comfort and aid her to the extent of his power,\r\ndisregardful of all consequences to himself. The examination\r\nproceeded:—\r\n\r\n\"Elizabeth Procter, you understand whereof you are charged; viz., to be\r\nguilty of sundry acts of witchcraft. What say you to it? Speak the\r\ntruth; and so you that are afflicted, you must speak the truth, as you\r\nwill answer it before God another day. Mary Walcot, doth this woman\r\nhurt you?—I never saw her so as to be hurt by her.\r\n\r\n\"Mercy Lewis, does she hurt you?\r\n\r\n\"(Her mouth was stopped.)\r\n\r\n\"Ann Putnam, does she hurt you?\r\n\r\n\"(She could not speak.)\r\n\r\n\"Abigail Williams, does she hurt you?\r\n\r\n\"(Her hand was thrust in her own mouth.)\r\n\r\n\"John, does she hurt you?—This is the woman that came in her shift, and\r\nchoked me.\r\n\r\n\"Did she ever bring the book?—Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n\"What to do?—To write.\r\n\r\n\"What? this woman?—Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure of it?—Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n\"(Again Abigail Williams and Ann Putnam were spoke to by the Court; but\r\nneither of them could make any answer, by reason of dumbness or other\r\nfits.)\r\n\r\n\"What do you say, Goody Procter, to these things?—I take God in heaven\r\nto be my witness, that I know nothing of it, no more than the child\r\nunborn.[ii.108]\r\n\r\n\"Ann Putnam, doth this woman hurt you?—Yes, sir: a great many times.\r\n\r\n\"(Then the accused looked upon them, and they fell into fits.)\r\n\r\n\"She does not bring the book to you, does she?—Yes, sir, often; and\r\nsaith she hath made her maid set her hand to it.\r\n\r\n\"Abigail Williams, does this woman hurt you?—Yes, sir, often.\r\n\r\n\"Does she bring the book to you?—Yes.\r\n\r\n\"What would she have you do with it?—To write in it, and I shall be\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\nTurning to the accused, Abigail said, \"Did not you tell me that your\r\nmaid had written?\" Goody Procter seems to have been utterly amazed at\r\nthe conduct and charges of the girls. She knew, of course, that what\r\nthey said was false; but perhaps she thought them crazy, and therefore\r\nobjects of pity and compassion, and felt disposed to treat them kindly,\r\nand see whether they could not be recalled to their senses, and\r\nrestored to their better nature: for Parris, in his account, says that\r\nat this point she answered the question thus put to her by Abigail\r\nthus: \"Dear child, it is not so. There is another judgment, dear\r\nchild.\" But kindness was thrown away upon them; for Parris says that\r\nimmediately \"Abigail and Ann had fits.\" After coming out of them, \"they\r\ncried out, 'Look you! there is Goody Procter upon the beam.'\"\r\nInstantly, as we may well suppose, the whole audience looked where they\r\npointed. Their manner gave assurance that they saw her \"on the beam,\"\r\namong the[ii.109] rafters of the meeting-house; but she was invisible\r\nto all other eyes. The people, no doubt, were filled with amazement at\r\nsuch supernaturalism. But John Procter, her husband, did not believe a\r\nword of it: and it is not to be doubted that he expressed his\r\nindignation at the nonsense and the outrage in his usual bold, strong,\r\nand unguarded language, which brought down the vengeance of the girls\r\nat once on his own head; for Parris, in his report, goes on to say:—\r\n\r\n\"(By and by, both of them cried out of Goodman Procter himself, and\r\nsaid he was a wizard. Immediately, many if not all of the bewitched had\r\ngrievous fits.)\r\n\r\n\"Ann Putnam, who hurt you?—Goodman Procter, and his wife too.\r\n\r\n\"(Afterwards, some of the afflicted cried, 'There is Procter going to\r\ntake up Mrs. Pope's feet!' and her feet were immediately taken up.)\r\n\r\n\"What do you say, Goodman Procter, to these things?—I know not. I am\r\ninnocent.\r\n\r\n\"(Abigail Williams cried out, 'There is Goodman Procter going to Mrs.\r\nPope!' and immediately said Pope fell into a fit.)\"\r\n\r\nAt this point, the deputy, or some member of the Court interposed, if I\r\ninterpret rightly Parris's report, which is here obscurely expressed,\r\ninasmuch as he does not say who spoke; but the import of the words\r\nindicates that they proceeded from some member of the Court, who was\r\nperfectly deceived:—\r\n\r\n\"You see, the Devil will deceive you: the children could see what you\r\nwas going to do before the woman was hurt.[ii.110] I would advise you\r\nto repentance, for the Devil is bringing you out.\r\n\r\n\"(Abigail Williams cried out again, 'There is Goodman Procter going to\r\nhurt Goody Bibber!' and immediately Goody Bibber fell into a fit. There\r\nwas the like of Mary Walcot, and divers others. Benjamin Gould gave in\r\nhis testimony, that he had seen Goodman Corey and his wife, Procter and\r\nhis wife, Goody Cloyse, Goody Nurse, and Goody Griggs in his chamber\r\nlast Thursday night. Elizabeth Hubbard was in a trance during the whole\r\nexamination. During the examination of Elizabeth Procter, Abigail\r\nWilliams and Ann Putnam both made offer to strike at said Procter; but,\r\nwhen Abigail's hand came near, it opened,—whereas it was made up into a\r\nfist before,—and came down exceeding lightly as it drew near to said\r\nProcter, and at length, with open and extended fingers, touched\r\nProcter's hood very lightly. Immediately, Abigail cried out, her\r\nfingers, her fingers, her fingers burned; and Ann Putnam took on most\r\ngrievously of her head, and sunk down.)\"\r\n\r\nHutchinson, after giving Parris's account of this examination,\r\nexpresses himself thus: \"No wonder the whole country was in a\r\nconsternation, when persons of sober lives and unblemished characters\r\nwere committed to prison upon such sort of evidence. Nobody was safe.\"\r\nAll things considered, it may perhaps be said, that, filled as the\r\nwitchcraft proceedings were throughout with folly and outrage, there\r\nwas nothing worse than this examination, conducted by the\r\ndeputy-governor and council, on the 11th of April, 1692, in the great\r\nmeeting-house of the First Church in Salem. It must have been a scene\r\nof the wildest disorder, par[ii.111]ticularly in the latter part of it.\r\nNo wonder that the people in general were deluded, when the most\r\nlearned councillors of the colony countenanced, participated in, and\r\ngave effect to, such disorderly procedures in a house of worship, in\r\nthe presence of a high judicial tribunal, and of the then supreme\r\ngovernment of the colony!\r\n\r\nBenjamin Gould gave his volunteer testimony without \"advisedness,\" and\r\nquite incontinently. He brought out Goodman Corey before the managers\r\nwere quite ready to fall upon him; and he antedated, by a considerable\r\nlength of time, any such imputation upon Goody Griggs. It was well for\r\nElizabeth Hubbard to have been in a trance, so that she could not hear\r\nthe mention of her aunt's name. The council seems to have adjourned to\r\nthe next day, at the same place, when Mr. Parris \"gave further\r\ninformation against said John Procter,\" which, unfortunately, has not\r\ncome down to us. The result was, that Sarah Cloyse, John Procter, and\r\nElizabeth his wife, were all committed for trial, and, with Rebecca\r\nNurse, Martha Corey, and Dorcas Good, were sent to the jail in Boston,\r\nin the custody of Marshal Herrick.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the 11th and 12th of April produced a great effect\r\nin driving on the general infatuation. Judge Sewall, who was present as\r\none of the council, in his diary at this date, says, \"Went to Salem,\r\nwhere, in the meeting-house, the persons accused of witchcraft were\r\nexamined; was a very great assembly; 'twas awful to see how the\r\nafflicted persons[ii.112] were agitated.\" In the margin is written,\r\napparently some time afterwards, the interjection \"_Væ!_\" thrice\r\nrepeated,—\"Alas, alas, alas!\" What perfectly deluded him and Danforth,\r\nand everybody else, were the exhibitions made by the \"afflicted\r\nchildren.\" This is the grand phenomenon of the witchcraft proceedings\r\nhere in 1692. It, and it alone, carried them through. Those girls, by\r\nlong practice in \"the circle,\" and day by day, before astonished and\r\nwondering neighbors gathered to witness their distresses, and\r\nespecially on the more public occasions of the examinations, had\r\nacquired consummate boldness and tact. In simulation of passions,\r\nsufferings, and physical affections; in sleight of hand, and in the\r\nmanagement of voice and feature and attitude,—no necromancers have\r\nsurpassed them. There has seldom been better acting in a theatre than\r\nthey displayed in the presence of the astonished and horror-stricken\r\nrulers, magistrates, ministers, judges, jurors, spectators, and\r\nprisoners. No one seems to have dreamed that their actings and\r\nsufferings could have been the result of cunning or imposture. Deodat\r\nLawson was a man of talents, had seen much of the world, and was by no\r\nmeans a simpleton, recluse, or novice; but he was wholly deluded by\r\nthem. The prisoners, although conscious of their own innocence, were\r\nutterly confounded by the acting of the girls. The austere principles\r\nof that generation forbade, with the utmost severity, all theatrical\r\nshows and performances. But at Salem Village and the old town, in the\r\nrespective meeting-houses, and at Deacon[ii.113] Nathaniel Ingersoll's,\r\nsome of the best playing ever got up in this country was practised; and\r\npatronized, for weeks and months, at the very centre and heart of\r\nPuritanism, by \"the most straitest sect\" of that solemn order of men.\r\nPastors, deacons, church-members, doctors of divinity, college\r\nprofessors, officers of state, crowded, day after day, to behold feats\r\nwhich have never been surpassed on the boards of any theatre; which\r\nrivalled the most memorable achievements of pantomimists,\r\nthaumaturgists, and stage-players; and made considerable approaches\r\ntowards the best performances of ancient sorcerers and magicians, or\r\nmodern jugglers and mesmerizers.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the council at Salem, on the 11th of April, 1692,\r\nchanged in one sense the whole character of the transaction. Before, it\r\nhad been a Salem affair. After this, it was a Massachusetts affair. The\r\ncolonial government at Boston had obtruded itself upon the ground, and,\r\nof its own will and seeking, irregularly, and without call or\r\njustification, had taken the whole thing out of the hands of the local\r\nauthorities into its own management. Neither the town nor the village\r\nof Salem is responsible, as a principal actor, for what subsequently\r\ntook place. To that meeting of the deputy-governor and his associates\r\nin the colonial administration, at an early period of the transaction,\r\nthe calamities, outrages, and shame that followed must in justice be\r\nascribed. Had it not taken place, the delusion, as in former instances\r\nand other places here and in the mother-country,[ii.114] would have\r\nremained within its original local limits, and soon disappeared. That\r\nmeeting, and the proceedings then had, gave to the fanaticism the\r\nmomentum that drove it on, and extended its destructive influence far\r\nand wide.\r\n\r\nThe next step in the proceedings is one of the most remarkable features\r\nin the case. It is, in some points of view, more suggestive of\r\nsuspicion, that there was, behind the whole, a skilful and cunning\r\nmanagement, ingeniously contriving schemes to mislead the public mind,\r\nthan almost any other part of the transaction. Mary Warren, as has been\r\nsaid, was a servant in the family of John Procter. She was a member of\r\nthe \"circle\" that had so long met at Mr. Parris's house or Thomas\r\nPutnam's. She was a constant attendant at its meetings, and a leading\r\nspirit among the girls. She did not take an open part against her\r\nmaster or mistress at their examination, although she acted with\r\navidity and malignity against them as an accusing witness at their\r\ntrials, two months afterwards. It is to be noticed, that Ann Putnam and\r\nAbigail Williams, at the examination of Elizabeth Procter, April 11,\r\naccused her of having induced or compelled \"her maid to set her hand to\r\nthe book.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of April, warrants were got out against Giles Corey and\r\nMary Warren, both of Salem Farms; Abigail Hobbs, daughter of William\r\nHobbs, of Topsfield; and Bridget Bishop, wife of Edward Bishop, of\r\nSalem,—to be brought in the next forenoon, at about eight o'clock, at\r\nthe house of Lieutenant Nathaniel[ii.115] Ingersoll, of Salem Village.\r\nHow Mary Warren became transformed from an accuser to an accused, from\r\nan afflicted person to an afflicter, is the question. It is not easy to\r\nfathom the conduct of these girls. They appear to have acted upon a\r\nplan deliberately formed, and to have had an understanding with each\r\nother. At the same time, occasionally, they had or pretended to have a\r\nfalling-out, and came into contradiction. This was perhaps a mere\r\nblind, to prevent the suspicion of collusion. The accounts given of\r\nMary Warren seem to render it quite certain that she acted with\r\ndeliberate cunning, and was a guilty conspirator with the other\r\naccusers in carrying on the plot from the beginning. No doubt, it\r\nfrequently occurred to those concerned in it, that suspicions might\r\npossibly get into currency that they were acting a part in concert. It\r\nwas necessary, by all means, to guard against such an idea. This may be\r\nthe key to interpret the arrest and proceedings against Mary Warren. If\r\nit is, the affair, it must be confessed, was managed with great\r\nshrewdness and skill. She conducted the stratagem most dexterously. All\r\nat once she fell away from the circle, and began to talk against the\r\n\"afflicted children,\" and went so far as to say, that they \"did but\r\ndissemble.\" Immediately, they cried out upon her, charged her with\r\nwitchcraft, and had her apprehended. After being carried to prison, she\r\nspoke in strong language against the proceedings. Four persons of\r\nunquestionable truthfulness, in prison with her, on the same charge,\r\nprepared a deposition[ii.116] to this effect: \"We heard Mary Warren\r\nseveral times say that the magistrates might as well examine Keysar's\r\ndaughter that had been distracted many years, and take notice of what\r\nshe said, as well as any of the afflicted persons. 'For,' said Mary\r\nWarren, 'when I was afflicted, I thought I saw the apparitions of a\r\nhundred persons;' for she said her head was distempered that she could\r\nnot tell what she said. And the said Mary told us, that, when she was\r\nwell again, she could not say that she saw any of the apparitions at\r\nthe time aforesaid.\" I will now give the substance of her examination,\r\nwhich commenced on the 19th of April. Mr. Parris was, as usual,\r\nrequested to take minutes of the proceedings, which have been\r\npreserved:—\r\n\r\n\"_Examination of Mary Warren, at a Court held at Salem Village, by John\r\nHathorne and Jonathan Corwin, Esqrs._\r\n\r\n\"(As soon as she was coming towards the bar, the afflicted fell into\r\nfits.)\r\n\r\n\"Mary Warren, you stand here charged with sundry acts of witchcraft.\r\nWhat do you say for yourself? Are you guilty or not?—I am innocent.\r\n\r\n\"Hath she hurt you? (Speaking to the sufferers.)\r\n\r\n\"(Some were dumb. Betty Hubbard testified against her, and then said\r\nHubbard fell into a violent fit.)\r\n\r\n\"You were, a little while ago, an afflicted person; now you are an\r\nafflicter. How comes this to pass?—I look up to God, and take it to be\r\na great mercy of God.\r\n\r\n\"What! do you take it to be a great mercy to afflict others?\r\n\r\n\"(Now they were all but John Indian grievously afflicted,[ii.117] and\r\nMrs. Pope also, who was not afflicted before hitherto this day; and,\r\nafter a few moments, John Indian fell into a violent fit also.)\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, here\" (Mr. Parris, the reporter, goes on to say) \"was one that\r\njust now was a tormenter in her apparition, and she owns that she had\r\nmade a league with the Devil.\" The marvel was, that, having before been\r\na sufferer, as one of the afflicted accusers, she had then, at that\r\nmoment, appeared in the opposite character, and owned herself to have\r\nbecome a confederate with the Evil One. Having established this\r\nconviction in the minds of the magistrates and spectators, the point\r\nwas reached at which she completed the delusion by appearing to break\r\naway from her bondage to Satan, assume the functions of a confessing\r\nand abjuring witch, and retake her place, with tenfold effect, among\r\nthe accusing witnesses. The manner in which she rescued herself from\r\nthe power of Satan exhibits a specimen of acting seldom surpassed. The\r\naccount proceeds thus:—\r\n\r\n\"Now Mary Warren fell into a fit, and some of the afflicted cried out\r\nthat she was going to confess; but Goody Corey, and Procter and his\r\nwife, came in, _in their apparition_, and struck her down, and said she\r\nshould tell nothing.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is given here in _Italics_, as an \"_apparition_,\" was of course\r\nbased upon the declarations of the accusing witnesses. It was an art\r\nthey often practised in offering their testimony. They would cry out,\r\nthat the Devil, generally in the shape of a black man, appeared to them\r\nat the time, whispering in the[ii.118] ear of the accused, or sitting\r\non the beams of the meeting-house in which the examinations were\r\ngenerally conducted. On this occasion, they declared that three of the\r\npersons, then in jail in some other place, came in their apparitions,\r\nforbade Mary Warren's confession, and struck her down. To give full\r\neffect to their statement, she went through the process of tumbling\r\ndown. Although nothing was seen by any other person present, the\r\ndeception was perfect. The Rev. Mr. Parris wrote it all down as having\r\nactually occurred. His record of the transaction goes on as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"Mary Warren continued a good space in a fit, that she did neither see\r\nnor hear nor speak.\r\n\r\n\"Afterwards she started up, and said, 'I will speak,' and cried out,\r\n'Oh, I am sorry for it, I am sorry for it!' and wringed her hands, and\r\nfell a little while into a fit again, and then came to speak, but\r\nimmediately her teeth were set; and then she fell into a violent fit,\r\nand cried out, 'O Lord, help me! O good Lord, save me!'\r\n\r\n\"And then afterwards cried again, 'I will tell, I will tell!' and then\r\nfell into a dead fit again.\r\n\r\n\"And afterwards cried, 'I will tell, they did, they did, they did;' and\r\nthen fell into a violent fit again.\r\n\r\n\"After a little recovery, she cried, 'I will tell, I will tell. They\r\nbrought me to it;' and then fell into a fit again, which fits\r\ncontinuing, she was ordered to be led out, and the next to be brought\r\nin, viz., Bridget Bishop.\r\n\r\n\"Some time afterwards, she was called in again, but immediately taken\r\nwith fits for a while.\r\n\r\n\"'Have you signed the Devil's book?—No.'[ii.119]\r\n\r\n\"'Have you not touched it?—No.'\r\n\r\n\"Then she fell into fits again, and was sent forth for air.\r\n\r\n\"After a considerable space of time, she was brought in again, but\r\ncould not give account of things by reason of fits, and so sent forth.\r\n\r\n\"Mary Warren called in afterwards in private, before magistrates and\r\nministers.\r\n\r\n\"She said, 'I shall not speak a word: but I will, I will speak, Satan!\r\nShe saith she will kill me. Oh! she saith she owes me a spite, and will\r\nclaw me off. Avoid Satan, for the name of God, avoid!' and then fell\r\ninto fits again, and cried, 'Will ye? I will prevent ye, in the name of\r\nGod.'\"\r\n\r\nThe magistrate inquired earnestly:—\r\n\r\n\"'Tell us how far have you yielded?'\r\n\r\n\"A fit interrupts her again.\r\n\r\n\"'What did they say you should do, and you should be well?'\r\n\r\n\"Then her lips were bit, so that she could not speak: so she was sent\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Parris, the reporter of the case, adds:—\r\n\r\n\"Note that not one of the sufferers was afflicted during her\r\nexamination, after once she began to confess, though they were\r\ntormented before.\"\r\n\r\nShe was subsequently examined in the prison several times, falling\r\noccasionally into fits, and exhibiting the appearance of a\r\nlong-continued conflict with Satan, who was supposed to be resisting\r\nher inclination to confess, and holding her with violence[ii.120] to\r\nthe contract she had made with him. The magistrates and ministers\r\nbeheld with amazement and awe what they believed to be precisely a\r\nsimilar scene to that described by the evangelists when the Devil\r\nstrove against the power of the Saviour and his disciples, and would\r\nnot quit his hold upon the young man, but \"threw him down, and tare\r\nhim.\" At length, as in that case, Satan was overcome. After a\r\nprotracted, most violent, and terrible contest, Mary Warren got\r\nreleased from his clutches, and made a full and circumstantial\r\nconfession.\r\n\r\nWhoever studies carefully the account of Mary Warren's successive\r\nexaminations can hardly question, I think, that she acted a part, and\r\nacted it with wonderful cunning, skill, and effect.\r\n\r\nThis examination, beginning on Tuesday, the 19th of April, continued\r\nafter she was committed to prison in Salem, at the jail there, for\r\nseveral days, and was renewed at intervals until the middle of May.\r\nAfter she had thoroughly broken away from Satan, she revealed all that\r\nshe had seen and heard while associating with him and his confederate\r\nsubjects: her testimony was implicitly received, and it dealt death and\r\ndestruction in all directions. It is a circumstance strongly confirming\r\nthis view, that Mary Warren was soon released from confinement. It was\r\nthe general practice to keep those, who confessed, in prison, to retain\r\nin that way power over them, and prevent their recanting their\r\nconfessions. She is found, by the papers on file, to have acted\r\nafterwards, as a capital witness,[ii.121] against ten persons, all of\r\nwhom were convicted, and seven executed. Besides these, she testified,\r\nwith the appearance of animosity and vindictiveness, against her master\r\nJohn Procter, and her mistress his wife; thus contributing to secure\r\nthe conviction of both, and the death of the former. In how many more\r\ncases she figured in the same character and to the same effect is\r\nunknown, as the papers in reference to only a very small proportion of\r\nthem have come down to us. The interpretation I give to the course of\r\nMary Warren exhibits her guilt, and that of those participating in the\r\nstratagem, as of the deepest and blackest dye. But it seems to be the\r\nonly one which a scrutiny of the details of her examinations, and of\r\nthe facts of the case, allows us to receive. The effect was most\r\ndecisive. The course of the accusing children in crying out against one\r\nof their own number satisfied the public, and convinced still more the\r\nmagistrates, that they were truthful, honest, and upright. They had\r\nbefore given evidence that they paid no regard to family influence or\r\neminent reputation. They had now proved that they had no partiality and\r\nno favoritism, but were equally ready to bring to light and to justice\r\nany of their own circle who might fall into the snare of the Evil One,\r\nand become confederate with him. No dramatic artist, no cunning\r\nimpostor, ever contrived a more ingenious plot; and no actors ever\r\ncarried one out better than Mary Warren and the afflicted children.\r\n\r\nGiles Corey incurred hostility, perhaps, because his[ii.122] deposition\r\nrelating to his wife did not come up to the mark required. It is also\r\nhighly probable, that, though incensed at her conduct at the time,\r\nreflection had brought him to his senses; and that the circumstances of\r\nher examination and commitment to prison produced a re-action in his\r\nmind. If so, he would have been apt to express himself very freely. His\r\nexamination took place April 19th, in the meeting-house at the Village.\r\nThe girls acted their usual part, charging him, one by one, with having\r\nafflicted them, and proving it on the spot by tortures and sufferings.\r\nAfter they had severally got through, they all joined at once in their\r\ndemonstrations. The report made by Parris says, \"All the afflicted were\r\nseized now with fits, and troubled with pinches. Then the Court ordered\r\nhis hands to be tied.\" The magistrates lost all control of themselves,\r\nand flew into a passion, exclaiming, \"What! is it not enough to act\r\nwitchcraft at other times, but must you do it now, in face of\r\nauthority?\" He seems to have been profoundly affected by the\r\nmarvellousness of the accusations, and the exhibition of what to him\r\nwas inexplicable in the sufferings of the girls; and all he could say\r\nwas, \"I am a poor creature, and cannot help it.\"—\"Upon the motion of\r\nhis head again, they had their heads and necks afflicted.\" The\r\nmagistrates, not having recovered their composure, continued to pour\r\ntheir wrath upon him, \"Why do you tell such wicked lies against\r\nwitnesses?\"—\"One of his hands was let go, and several were afflicted.\r\nHe held his head on one side,[ii.123] and then the heads of several of\r\nthe afflicted were held on one side. He drew in his cheeks, and the\r\ncheeks of some of the afflicted were sucked in.\" Goody Bibber was on\r\nhand, and played her accompaniment. She also uttered malignant charges\r\nagainst him, and \"was suddenly seized with a violent fit.\" One of\r\nBibber's statements was that he had called her husband \"damned devilish\r\nrogue.\" Through all this outrage, Corey was firm in asserting his\r\ninnocence. His language and manner were serious, and solemnized by a\r\nsense of the helplessness of his situation and the wicked falsehoods\r\nheaped upon him. His disagreement with his wife about the witchcraft\r\nproceedings being well known, the accusers endeavored to make it out\r\nthat they had often quarrelled. But he insisted that the only\r\ndifference which had before existed between them was a conflict of\r\nopinion on one point. In his family devotions, he used this expression,\r\n\"living to God and dying to sin.\" She \"found fault\" with the language,\r\nand criticised it. He thought it was all right! The characteristic\r\nspirit of the old man was roused most strikingly by one of the charges.\r\nBibber and others testified that Corey had said he had seen the Devil\r\nin the shape of a black hog and was very much frightened. He could not\r\nstand under the imputation of cowardice, and lost sight of every other\r\nelement in the accusation but that. The magistrate asked, \"What did you\r\nsee in the cow-house? Why do you deny it?\"—\"I saw nothing but my\r\ncattle.\"—\"(Divers witnessed that he told[ii.124] them he was\r\nfrighted.)\"—\"Well, what do you say to these witnesses? What was it\r\nfrighted you?\"—\"I do not know that ever I spoke the word in my life.\"\r\n\r\nBut while his character retained its manliness, and his soul was truly\r\ninsensible to fear, he was very much oppressed and distressed by his\r\nsituation. The share he had, with two of his sons-in-law, in bringing\r\nhis wife into her awful condition, and in driving on the public\r\ninfatuation at the beginning, was more than he could endure to think\r\nof, and he was charged with having meditated suicide. Perhaps he had\r\nalready formed the purpose afterwards carried into effect, and may have\r\ndropped expressions, under that thought, which to others might appear\r\nto indicate a design of self-destruction. He was accused of having said\r\nthat \"he would make away with himself, and charge his death upon his\r\nson.\" His sons-in-law, Crosby and Parker, were acting with the crowd\r\nthat were pursuing him to his death. Little did it enter the\r\nimagination of any one then, that there was a method by which he could\r\n\"make away with himself,\" leaving the entire act of the destruction of\r\nhis life upon his persecutors, and the sin to be apportioned between\r\nhim and them by the All-wise and All-just.\r\n\r\nAbigail Hobbs had been a reckless vagrant creature, wandering through\r\nthe woods at night like a half-deranged person; but she had wit enough\r\nto see that there was safety in confession. She pretended to have\r\ncommitted, by witchcraft, crimes enough to have[ii.125] hanged her a\r\ndozen times. If she had stood to her confession, we should have heard\r\nof her no more.\r\n\r\nBridget Bishop's examination filled the intervals of time while Mary\r\nWarren was being carried out of the meeting-house to recover from her\r\nfits. Both Parris and Ezekiel Cheever took minutes of it, from which\r\nthe substance is gathered as follows:—\r\n\r\nOn her coming in, the afflicted persons, at the same moment, severally\r\nfell into fits, and were dreadfully tormented. Hathorne addressed her,\r\ncalling upon her to give an account of the witchcrafts she was\r\n\"conversant in.\" She replied, \"I take all this people to witness that I\r\nam clear.\" He then asked the children, \"Hath this woman hurt you?\" They\r\nall cried out that she had. The magistrate continued, \"You are here\r\naccused by four or five: what do you say to it?\"—\"I never saw these\r\npersons before, nor I never[A] was in this place before. I never did\r\nhurt them in my life.\"\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the afflicted children and others, some one declared\r\nthat Bridget Bishop was present \"in her shape\" or apparition, and,\r\npointing to a particular spot, said, \"There, there she is!\" Young\r\nJonathan Walcot, exasperated by his sister's sufferings, struck at the\r\nspot with his sword; whereupon Mary cried out, \"You have hit her, you\r\nhave torn her coat, and I heard it tear.\" This story had been brought\r\nto Hathorne's ears; and abruptly, as if to take her off her\r\nguard,[ii.126] he said, \"Is not your coat cut?\" She answered, \"No.\"\r\nThey then examined the coat, and found what they regarded as having\r\nbeen \"cut or torn two ways.\" It was probably the fashion in which the\r\ngarment was made; for she was in the habit of dressing more\r\nartistically than the women of the Village. At any rate, it did not\r\nappear like a direct cut of a sword; but Jonathan got over the\r\ndifficulty by saying that \"the sword that he struck at Goody Bishop was\r\nnot naked, but was within the scabbard.\" This explained the whole\r\nmatter, so that Cheever says, in his report, that \"the rent may very\r\nprobably be the very same that Mary Walcot did tell that she had in her\r\ncoat, by Jonathan's striking at her appearance\"! Parris says, with more\r\ncaution, more indeed than was usual with him, \"Upon some search in the\r\nCourt, a rent, that seems to answer what was alleged, was found.\"\r\n\r\nHathorne, having heard the scandals they had circulated against her,\r\nproceeded: \"They say you bewitched your first husband to death.\"—\"If it\r\nplease Your Worship, I know nothing of it.\"—\"What do you say of these\r\nmurders you are charged with?\"—\"I hope I am not guilty of murder.\" As\r\nshe said this, she turned up her eyes, probably to give solemnity to\r\nher declaration. At the opening of the examination, she looked round\r\nupon the people, and called them to witness her innocence. She had\r\nfound out by this time, that no justice could be expected from them;\r\nand feeling, with Rebecca Nurse on a recent similar occasion, \"I have\r\ngot nobody to look to but[ii.127] God,\" she turned her eyes heavenward.\r\nInstantly, the eyeballs of all the girls were rolled up in their\r\nsockets, and fixed. The effect was awful, and still more increased as\r\nthey went, after a moment or two, into dreadful torments. Hathorne\r\ncould no longer contain himself, but broke out, \"Do you not see how\r\nthey are tormented? You are acting witchcraft before us! What do you\r\nsay to this? Why have you not a heart to confess the truth?\" She calmly\r\nreplied, \"I am innocent. I know nothing of it. I am no witch. I know\r\nnot what a witch is.\" The \"afflicted children\" charged her with having\r\ntried to persuade them to sign the Devil's book. As she had never\r\nbefore seen one of them, she was indignant at this barefaced falsehood,\r\nand, as Cheever says, \"shook her head\" in her resentment; which, as he\r\nfurther says, put them all into great torments. Parris represents that\r\nin every motion of her head they were tortured. Marshal Herrick, as\r\nusual, put in his oar, and volunteered charges against her. She bore\r\nherself well through the shocking scene, and did not shrink, at its\r\nclose, from expressing her unbelief of the whole thing: \"I do not know\r\nwhether there be any witches or no.\" When she was removed from the\r\nplace of examination, the accusers all had fits, and broke forth in\r\noutcries of agony. After being taken out, one of the constables in\r\ncharge of her asked her if she was not troubled to see the afflicted\r\npersons so tormented; and she replied, \"No.\" In answer to further\r\nquestions, she indicated that she could not[ii.128] tell what to think\r\nof them, and did not concern herself about them at all.\r\n\r\nGiles Corey, Bridget Bishop, Abigail Hobbs, together with Mary Warren,\r\nwere duly committed to prison.\r\n\r\nTwo days after, April 21, warrants were issued \"against William Hobbs,\r\nhusbandman, and Deliverance his wife; Nehemiah Abbot, Jr., weaver; Mary\r\nEasty, the wife of Isaac Easty; and Sarah Wilds, the wife of John\r\nWilds,—all of the town of Topsfield, or Ipswich; and Edward Bishop,\r\nhusbandman, and Sarah his wife, of Salem Village; and Mary Black, a\r\nnegro of Lieutenant Nathaniel Putnam's, of Salem Village also; and Mary\r\nEnglish, the wife of Philip English, merchant in Salem.\" All of them\r\nwere to be delivered to the magistrates for examination at the house of\r\nLieutenant Nathaniel Ingersoll, at about ten o'clock the next morning,\r\nin Salem Village; and were brought in accordingly.\r\n\r\nWhat the papers on file enable us to glean of these nine persons is\r\nsubstantially as follows: William Hobbs was about fifty years of age,\r\nand one of the earliest settlers of the Village, although his residence\r\nwas on the territory afterwards included in Topsfield. His daughter\r\nAbigail, of whom I have just spoken, appears from all the accounts to\r\nhave acted at this stage of the transaction a most wicked part, ready\r\nto do all the mischief in her power, and allowing herself to be used to\r\nany extent to fasten the imputation of witchcraft upon others. Several\r\npersons testified that, long before, she had boasted that[ii.129] she\r\nwas not afraid of any thing, \"for she had sold herself body and soul to\r\nthe Old Boy;\" one witness testified, that, \"some time last winter, I\r\nwas discoursing with Abigail Hobbs about her wicked carriages and\r\ndisobedience to her father and mother, and she told me she did not care\r\nwhat anybody said to her, for she had seen the Devil, and had made a\r\ncovenant or bargain with him;\" another, Margaret Knight, testified,\r\nthat, about a year before, \"Abigail Hobbs and her mother were at my\r\nfather's house, and Abigail Hobbs said to me, 'Margaret, are you\r\nbaptized?' And I said, 'Yes.' Then said she, 'My mother is not\r\nbaptized, but I will baptize her;' and immediately took water, and\r\nsprinkled in her mother's face, and said she did baptize her 'in the\r\nname of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.'\"\r\n\r\nShe was arrested, and brought to the Village, on the 19th of April. The\r\nnext day, she began her operations by declaring that \"Judah White, a\r\nJersey maid\" that lived with Joseph Ingersoll at Casco, \"but now lives\r\nat Boston,\" appeared to her \"in apparition\" the day before, and advised\r\nher to \"fly, and not to go to be examined,\" but, if she did go, \"not to\r\nconfess any thing:\" she described the dress of this \"apparition,\"—she\r\n\"came to her in fine clothes, in a sad-colored silk mantle, with a\r\ntop-knot and a hood.\"—\"She confesseth further, that the Devil in the\r\nshape of a man came to her,\" and charged her to afflict the girls;\r\nbringing images made of wood in their likeness with thorns for her to\r\nprick into the images, which she[ii.130] did: whereupon the girls cried\r\nout that they were hurt by her. She further confessed, that, \"she was\r\nat the great meeting in Mr. Parris's pasture, when they administered\r\nthe sacrament, and did eat of the red bread and drink of the red wine,\r\nat the same time.\" This confession established her credibility at once;\r\nand, the next day, the warrants were issued for the nine persons above\r\nmentioned, against whom they had secured in her an effective witness.\r\nShe had resided for some time at Casco Bay; and we shall soon see how\r\nmatters began in a few days to work in that direction. There are two\r\nindictments against this Abigail Hobbs: one charging her with having\r\nmade a covenant with \"the Evil Spirit, the Devil,\" at Casco Bay, in\r\n1688; the other with having exercised the arts of witchcraft upon the\r\nafflicted girls, at Salem Village, in 1692.\r\n\r\nWhen her unhappy father was brought to examination, he found that his\r\ndaughter was playing into the hands of the accusers; and that his wife,\r\noverwhelmed by the horrors of the situation, although for a time\r\nprotesting her innocence and lamenting that she had been the mother of\r\nsuch a daughter, had broken down and confessed, saying whatever might\r\nbe put in her mouth by the magistrates, the girls, or the crowd. Under\r\nthese circumstances, he was brought forward for examination. Parris\r\ntook minutes of it. It is to be regretted, that the paper is much\r\ndilapidated, and portions of the lines wholly lost. What is left shows\r\nthat the mind of William Hobbs rose superior[ii.131] to the terrors and\r\npowers arrayed against it. The magistrate commenced proceedings by\r\ninquiring of the girls, pointing to the prisoner, \"Hath this man hurt\r\nyou?\" Several of them answered \"Yes.\" Goody Bibber, who seems generally\r\nto have been a very zealous volunteer backer of the girls, on this\r\noccasion, for a wonder, answered \"No.\" The magistrate, addressing the\r\nprisoner, \"What say you? Are you guilty or not?\"—Answer: \"I can speak\r\nin the presence of God safely, as I must look to give account another\r\nday, that I am as clear as a new-born babe.\"—\"Clear of what?\"—\"Of\r\nwitchcraft.\"—\"Have you never hurt these?\"—\"No.\" Abigail Williams cried\r\nout that he \"was going to Mercy Lewis!\" Whereupon Mercy was seized with\r\na fit. Then Abigail cried out again, \"He is coming to Mary Walcot!\" and\r\nMary went into her fit. The magistrate, in consternation, appealed to\r\nhim: \"How can you be clear,\" when your appearance is thus seen\r\nproducing such effects before our eyes? Then the children went into\r\nfits all together, and \"hallooed\" at the top of their voices, and\r\n\"shouted greatly.\" The magistrate then brought up the confession of his\r\nwife against him, and expostulated with him for not confessing; the\r\nafflicted, in the mean while, bringing the whole machinery of their\r\nconvulsions, shrieks, and uproar to bear against him: but he calmly,\r\nand in brief terms, denied it.\r\n\r\nThe circle of accusing girls seems to have been a receptacle, into\r\nwhich all the scandal, gossip, and[ii.132] defamation of the\r\nsurrounding country was emptied. Some one had told them that William\r\nHobbs was not a regular attendant at meeting. They passed it on to the\r\nmagistrate, and he put this question to the accused: \"When were you at\r\nany public religious meeting?\" He replied, \"Not a pretty while.\"—\"Why\r\nso?\"—\"Because I was not well: I had a distemper that none knows.\" The\r\nmagistrate said, \"Can you act witchcraft here, and, by casting your\r\neyes, turn folks into fits?\"—\"You may judge your pleasure. My soul is\r\nclear.\"—\"Do you not see you hurt these by your look?\"—\"No: I do not\r\nknow it.\" After another display of awful sufferings, caused, as they\r\nprotested, by the mere look of Hobbs, the magistrate, with triumphant\r\nconfidence, again put it home to him, \"Can you now deny it?\" He\r\nanswered, \"I can deny it to my dying day.\" The magistrate inquired of\r\nhim for what reason he withdrew from the room whenever the Scriptures\r\nwere read in his family. He plumply denied it. Nathaniel Ingersoll and\r\nThomas Haynes testified that his daughter had told them so. The\r\nconfessions of his wife and daughter were over and over again brought\r\nup against him, but to no effect. \"Who do you worship?\" said the\r\nmagistrate. \"I hope I worship God only.\"—\"Where?\"—\"In my heart.\" The\r\nexamination failed to confound or embarrass him in the least. He could\r\nnot be drawn into the expression of any of the feelings which the\r\nconduct of his graceless and depraved daughter or his weak and wretched\r\nwife must have[ii.133] excited. He quietly protested that he knew\r\nnothing about witchcraft; and, towards the close, with solemn\r\nearnestness of utterance, declared that his innocence was known to the\r\n\"great God in heaven.\"\r\n\r\nHe was committed for trial. All that the documents in existence inform\r\nus further, in relation to William Hobbs, is that he remained in prison\r\nuntil the 14th of the next December, when two of his neighbors, John\r\nNichols and Joseph Towne, in some way succeeded in getting him bailed\r\nout; they giving bonds in the sum of two hundred pounds for his\r\nappearance at the sessions of the Court the next month. But it was not,\r\neven then, thought wholly safe to have him come in; and the fine was\r\nincurred. He appeared at the term in May, the fine was remitted, and he\r\ndischarged by proclamation. On the 26th of March, 1714, he gave\r\nevidence in a case of commonage rights. He was then seventy-two years\r\nof age. Of his wife and daughter, I shall again have occasion to speak.\r\n\r\nFor all that is known of the case of Nehemiah Abbot, we are indebted to\r\nHutchinson, who had Parris's minutes of the examination before him.\r\nHutchinson says, that, of \"near an hundred\" whose examinations he had\r\nseen, he was the only one who, having been brought before the\r\nmagistrates, was finally dismissed by them. Perhaps even this case was\r\nnot an exception: for a document on file shows that a person named\r\nAbbot of the same locality was subsequently arrested and imprisoned;\r\nbut unfortunately[ii.134] the Christian name has been obliterated, or\r\nfrom some cause is wanting. It seems, from Hutchinson's minutes, that\r\nhe protested his innocence in manly and firm declarations. Mary Walcot\r\ntestified that she had seen his shape. Ann Putnam cried out that she\r\nsaw him \"upon the beam.\" The magistrates told him that his guilt was\r\ncertainly proved, and that, if he would find mercy of God, he must\r\nconfess. \"I speak before God,\" he answered, \"that I am clear from this\r\naccusation.\"—\"What, in all respects?\"—\"Yes, in all respects.\" The girls\r\nwere struck with dumbness; and Ann Putnam, re-affirming that he was the\r\nman that hurt her, \"was taken with a fit.\" Mary Walcot began to waver\r\nin her confidence, and Mercy Lewis said, \"It is not the man.\" This\r\nunprecedented variance in the testimony of the girls brought matters to\r\na stand; and he was sent out for a time, while others were examined:—\r\n\r\n\"When he was brought in again, by reason of much people, and many in\r\nthe windows, so that the accusers could not have a clear view of him,\r\nhe was ordered to be abroad, and the accusers to go forth to him, and\r\nview him in the light, which they did in the presence of the\r\nmagistrates and many others, discoursed quietly with him, one and all\r\nacquitting him; but yet said he was like that man, but he had not the\r\nwen they saw in his apparition. Note, he was a hilly-faced man, and\r\nstood shaded by reason of his own hair; so that for a time he seemed to\r\nsome bystanders and observers to be considerably like the person the\r\nafflicted did describe.\" [ii.135]\r\n\r\nSuch is Parris's statement, as quoted by Hutchinson. What was the real\r\ncause or motive of this discrepancy among the witnesses does not\r\nappear. The facts, that at first they went into fits in beholding him,\r\nwere all struck dumb for a while, and Ann Putnam saw him on the beam,\r\nwere likely to have an unfavorable effect upon the minds of the people,\r\nand threatened to explode the delusion. But Ann, with a quickness of\r\nwit that never failed to meet any emergency, when Mercy Lewis said it\r\nwas not the man, cried out in a fit, \"Did you put a mist before my\r\neyes?\" She conveyed the idea that the power of Satan blinded her, and\r\ncaused her to mistake the man. This answered the purpose; and, although\r\nAbbot got clear, for the time at least, all were more than ever\r\nconvinced that the Evil One, in misleading Ann, had shown his hand on\r\nthe occasion.\r\n\r\nThe examination of Sarah Wildes had no peculiar features. The afflicted\r\nchildren and Goody Bibber saw her apparition sitting on the beam while\r\nshe was bodily present at the bar, and went through their usual fits\r\nand evolutions. She maintained her innocence with dignity and firmness;\r\nand the magistrate, prejudging the case against her, rebuked her\r\nobstinacy in not confessing, in his accustomed manner.\r\n\r\nNo account has come down of the examinations of Edward Bishop, or Sarah\r\nhis wife. He was the third of that name, probably the son of the\r\n\"Sawyer.\" His wife Sarah was a daughter of William Wildes of Ipswich,\r\nand, it would seem, a sister of John[ii.136] Wildes, the examination of\r\nwhose wife has just been mentioned. Some of the evidence indicates that\r\nshe was a niece of Rebecca Nurse. They all belonged to that class of\r\npersons who, under the general appellation of \"the Topsfield men,\" had\r\nbeen in such frequent collision with the people of the Village. Edward\r\nBishop was forty-four years of age, and his wife forty-one. They had a\r\nfamily, at the time of their imprisonment, of twelve children. Sarah\r\nBishop had been dismissed from the church at the Village, and\r\nrecommended to that at Topsfield, May 25, 1690. They had land in\r\nTopsfield, as well as in the Village, and were more intimately\r\nconnected in social relations with the former than the latter place.\r\nThey effected their escape from prison, and survived the storm. Mary,\r\nthe wife of Philip English, was committed to prison. We have no record\r\nof her examination.\r\n\r\nMary Black, the negro woman, belonged to Nathaniel Putnam, but lived in\r\nthe family of his son Benjamin. Her examination shows that she was an\r\nignorant but an innocent person. She knew nothing about the matter, and\r\nhad no idea what it all meant. To the questions with which the\r\nmagistrate pressed her, her answers were, \"I do not know,\" \"I cannot\r\ntell.\" The only fact brought out against her besides the actings of the\r\ngirls was this: \"Her master saith a man sat down upon the form with her\r\nabout a twelvemonth ago.\" Parris, in his minutes, gives this piece of\r\nevidence, but does not enlighten us as to its import. The magistrate\r\nasked her, \"What did the man[ii.137] say to you?\" Her answer was: \"He\r\nsaid nothing.\" This is all they got out of her; and it is all the light\r\nwe have on the mysterious fact, that a man was once seated, at some\r\ntime within twelve months, on the same form or bench with poor Mary\r\nBlack. The magistrate asked the girls, \"Doth this negro hurt you?\" They\r\nsaid \"Yes.\"—\"Why do you hurt them?\"—\"I did not hurt them.\" This\r\nquestion was put to her, \"Do you prick sticks?\" perhaps the meaning\r\nwas, Do you prick the afflicted children with sticks? The simple\r\ncreature evidently did not know what they were driving at, and\r\nanswered, \"No: I pin my neckcloth.\" The examiner asked her, \"Will you\r\ntake out the pin, and pin it again?\" She did so, and several of the\r\nafflicted cried out that they were pricked. Mary Walcot was pricked in\r\nthe arm till the blood came, Abigail Williams was pricked in the\r\nstomach, and Mercy Lewis was pricked in the foot. It is probable, that,\r\nin this case, the girls, as they often appear to have done, provided\r\nthemselves by concert beforehand with pins ready to be stuck into the\r\nassigned parts of their bodies, and managed to get the queer and\r\nunusual question put. The whole thing has the appearance of being\r\npre-arranged; and it answered the purpose, filling the crowd with\r\namazement, and excluding all possible doubt from the minds of the\r\nmagistrates. Mary was committed to prison, where she remained until\r\ndischarged, in May, 1693, by proclamation from the governor.\r\n\r\nMary Easty, wife of Isaac Easty, and sister of Re[ii.138]becca Nurse\r\nand Sarah Cloyse, was about fifty-eight years of age, and the mother of\r\nseven children. Her husband owned and lived upon a large and valuable\r\nfarm, which not many years since was the property and country residence\r\nof the late Hon. B.W. Crowninshield, and is now in the possession of\r\nThomas Pierce, Esq. Her examination was accompanied by the usual\r\ncircumstances. The girls had fits, and were speechless at times: the\r\nmagistrate expostulated with her for not confessing her guilt, which he\r\nregarded as demonstrated, beyond a question, by the sufferings of the\r\nafflicted. \"Would you have me accuse myself?\"—\"How far,\" he continued,\r\n\"have you complied with Satan?\"—\"Sir, I never complied, but prayed\r\nagainst him all my days. What would you have me do?\"—\"Confess, if you\r\nbe guilty.\"—\"I will say it, if it was my last time, I am clear of this\r\nsin.\" The magistrate, apparently affected by her manner and bearing,\r\ninquired of the girls, \"Are you certain this is the woman?\" They all\r\nwent into fits; and presently Ann Putnam, coming to herself, said \"that\r\nwas the woman, it was like her, and she told me her name.\" The accused\r\nclasped her hands together, and Mercy Lewis's hands were clenched; she\r\nseparated her hands, and Mercy's were released; she inclined her head,\r\nand the girls screamed out, \"Put up her head; for, while her head is\r\nbowed, the necks of these are broken.\" The magistrate again asked, \"Is\r\nthis the woman?\" They made signs that they could not speak; but\r\nafterwards Ann Putnam and others[ii.139] cried out: \"O Goody Easty,\r\nGoody Easty, you are the woman, you are the woman!\"—\"What do you say to\r\nthis?\"—\"Why, God will know.\"—\"Nay, God knows now.\"—\"I know he\r\ndoes.\"—\"What did you think of the actions of others before your sisters\r\ncame out? did you think it was witchcraft?\"—\"I cannot tell.\"—\"Why do\r\nyou not think it is witchcraft?\"—\"It is an evil spirit; but whether it\r\nbe witchcraft I do not know.\" She was committed to prison.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that seven out of the nine examined at this time\r\neither lived in Topsfield or were intimately connected with the church\r\nand people there. The accusing girls had heard them angrily spoken of\r\nby the people around them, and availed themselves, as at all times, of\r\nexisting prejudices, to guide them in the selection of their victim.\r\n\r\nThe escape of Abbot, and the wavering, in his case and that of Easty,\r\nindicated by the magistrates on this occasion, alarmed the prosecutors;\r\nand they felt that something must be done to stiffen Hathorne and\r\nCorwin to their previous rigid method of procedure. The following\r\nletter was accordingly written to them that very day, immediately after\r\nthe close of the examinations:—\r\n\r\n\"_These to the Honored John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin, Esqrs.,\r\nliving at Salem, present._\r\n\r\n\"Salem Village, this 21st of April, 1692.\r\n\r\n\"Much Honored,—After most humble and hearty thanks presented to Your\r\nHonors for the great care and pains you have already taken for us,—for\r\nwhich you know[ii.140] we are never able to make you recompense, and we\r\nbelieve you do not expect it of us; therefore a full reward will be\r\ngiven you of the Lord God of Israel, whose cause and interest you have\r\nespoused (and we trust this shall add to your crown of glory in the day\r\nof the Lord Jesus): and we—beholding continually the tremendous works\r\nof Divine Providence, not only every day, but every hour—thought it our\r\nduty to inform Your Honors of what we conceive you have not heard,\r\nwhich are high and dreadful,—of a wheel within a wheel, at which our\r\nears do tingle. Humbly craving continually your prayers and help in\r\nthis distressed case,—so, praying Almighty God continually to prepare\r\nyou, that you may be a terror to evil-doers and a praise to them that\r\ndo well, we remain yours to serve in what we are able,\r\n\r\n\"Thomas Putnam.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was meant by the \"wheel within a wheel,\" the \"high and dreadful\"\r\nthings which were making their ears to tingle, but had not yet been\r\ndisclosed to the magistrates, we shall presently see. On the 30th of\r\nApril, Captain Jonathan Walcot and Sergeant Thomas Putnam (the writer\r\nof the foregoing letter) got out a warrant against Philip English, of\r\nSalem, merchant; Sarah Morrel, of Beverly; and Dorcas Hoar, of the same\r\nplace, widow. Morrel and Hoar were delivered by Marshal Herrick,\r\naccording to the tenor of the warrant, at 11, a.m., May 2, at the house\r\nof Lieutenant Nathaniel Ingersoll, in Salem Village. The warrant has an\r\nindorsement in these words: \"Mr. Philip English not being to be found.\r\nG.H.\" As the records of the examinations of Philip English[ii.141] and\r\nhis wife have not been preserved, and only a few fragments of the\r\ntestimony relating to their case are to be found, all that can be said\r\nis that the girls and their accomplices made their usual charges\r\nagainst them. There are two depositions in existence, however, which\r\nafford some explanation of the causes that exposed Mr. English to\r\nhostility, and indicate the kind of evidence that was brought against\r\nhim. Having many landed estates, in various places, and extensive\r\nbusiness transactions, he was liable to frequent questions of\r\nlitigation. He was involved, at one time, in a lawsuit about the bounds\r\nof a piece of land in Marblehead. A person named William Beale, of that\r\ntown, had taken great interest in it adversely to the claims of\r\nEnglish; and some harsh words passed between them. A year or two after\r\nthe affair, Beale states, \"that, as I lay in my bed, in the morning,\r\npresently after it was fair light abroad in the room,\" \"I saw a dark\r\nshade,\" &c. To his vision it soon assumed the shape of Philip English.\r\nOn a previous occasion, when riding through Lynn to get testimony\r\nagainst English in the aforesaid boundary case, he says, \"My nose\r\ngushed out bleeding in a most extraordinary manner, so that it bloodied\r\na handkerchief of considerable bigness, and also ran down upon my\r\nclothes and upon my horse's mane.\" He charged it upon English. These\r\ndepositions were sworn to in Court, in August, 1692, and January, 1693.\r\nHow they got there does not appear, as English was never brought to\r\ntrial. All that relates to Mr.[ii.142] English and his wife may be\r\ndespatched at this point. On the 6th of May, a warrant was procured at\r\nBoston, \"To the marshal-general, or his lawful deputy,\" to apprehend\r\nPhilip English wherever found within the jurisdiction, and convey him\r\nto the \"custody of the marshal of Essex.\" Jacob Manning, a\r\ndeputy-marshal, delivered him to the marshal of Essex on the 30th of\r\nMay; and he was brought before the magistrates on the next day, and,\r\nafter examination, committed to prison. He and his wife effected their\r\nescape from jail, and found refuge in New York until the proceedings\r\nwere terminated, when they returned to Salem, and continued to reside\r\nhere. She survived the shock given by the accusation, the danger to\r\nwhich she had been exposed, and the sufferings of imprisonment, but a\r\nshort time. They occupied the highest social position. He was a\r\nmerchant, conducting an extensive business, and had a large estate;\r\nowning fourteen buildings in the town, a wharf, and twenty-one sail of\r\nvessels. His dwelling-house, represented in the frontispiece of this\r\nvolume, stood until a recent period, and is remembered by many of us.\r\nIts site was on the southern side of Essex Street, near its\r\ntermination; comprising the area between English and Webb Streets. It\r\nmust have been a beautiful situation; commanding at that time a full,\r\nunobstructed view of the Beverly and Marblehead shores, and all the\r\nwaters and points of land between them. The mansion was spacious in its\r\ndimensions, and bore the marks of having been constructed in\r\nthe[ii.143] best style of elegance, strength, and finish. It was indeed\r\na curious and venerable specimen of the domestic architecture of its\r\nday. A first-class house then; in its proportions, arrangements, and\r\nattachments, it would compare well with first-class houses now. Mrs.\r\nEnglish was a lady of eminent character and culture. Traditions to this\r\neffect have come down with singular uniformity through all the old\r\nfamilies of the place. She was the only child of Richard Hollingsworth,\r\nand inherited his large property. The Rev. William Bentley, D.D., in\r\nhis \"Description of Salem,\" and whose daily life made him conversant\r\nwith all that relates to the locality of Mrs. English's residence, says\r\nthat the officer came to apprehend her in the evening, after she had\r\nretired to rest. He was admitted by the servants, and read his warrant\r\nin her bedchamber. Guards were placed around the house. To be accused\r\nby the afflicted children was then regarded as certain death. \"In the\r\nmorning,\" says Bentley, \"she attended the devotions of her family,\r\nkissed her children with great composure, proposed her plan for their\r\neducation, took leave of them, and then told the officer she was ready\r\nto die.\" Dr. Bentley suggests that unfriendly feelings may have existed\r\nagainst Mr. English in consequence of some controversies he had been\r\nengaged in with the town about the title to lands; that the superior\r\nstyle in which his family lived had subjected them to vulgar prejudice;\r\nthat the existence of this feeling becoming known to the \"afflicted\r\ngirls\" led them[ii.144] to cry out against him and his wife. It may be\r\nso. They availed themselves of every such advantage; and particularly\r\nliked to strike high, so as the more to astound and overawe the public\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nI find no further mention of Sarah Morrel. She doubtless shared the\r\nfate of those escaping death,—a long imprisonment. When Dorcas Hoar was\r\nbrought in, there was a general commotion among the afflicted, falling\r\ninto fits all around. After coming out of them, they vied with each\r\nother in heaping all sorts of accusations upon the prisoner; Abigail\r\nWilliams and Ann Putnam charging her with having choked a woman in\r\nBoston; Elizabeth Hubbard crying out that she was pinching her, \"and\r\nshowing the marks to the standers by. The marshal said she pinched her\r\nfingers at the time.\" The magistrate, indignantly believing the whole,\r\nsaid, \"Dorcas Hoar, why do you hurt these?\"—\"I never hurt any child in\r\nmy life.\" The girls then charged her with having killed her husband,\r\nand with various other crimes. Mary Walcot, Susanna Sheldon, and\r\nAbigail Williams said they saw a black man whispering in her ear. The\r\nspirit of the prisoner was raised; and she said, \"Oh, you are liars,\r\nand God will stop the mouth of liars!\" The anger of the magistrates was\r\nroused by this bold outbreak. \"You are not to speak after this manner\r\nin the Court.\"—\"I will speak the truth as long as I live,\" she\r\nfearlessly replied. Parris says, at the close of his account, \"The\r\nafflicted were much distressed[ii.145] during her examination.\" Of\r\ncourse, she was sent to prison.\r\n\r\nSusanna Martin of Amesbury, a widow, was arrested on a warrant dated\r\nApril 30, and examined at the Village church May 2. She is described as\r\na short active woman, wearing a hood and scarf, plump and well\r\ndeveloped in her figure, of remarkable personal neatness. One of the\r\nitems of the evidence against her was, that, \"in an extraordinary dirty\r\nseason, when it was not fit for any person to travel, she came on foot\"\r\nto a house at Newbury. The woman of the house, the substance of whose\r\ntestimony I am giving, having asked, \"whether she came from Amesbury\r\nafoot,\" expressed her surprise at her having ventured abroad in such\r\nbad walking, and bid her children make way for her to come to the fire\r\nto dry herself. She replied \"she was as dry as I was,\" and turned her\r\ncoats aside; \"and I could not perceive that the soles of her shoes were\r\nwet. I was startled at it, that she should come so dry; and told her\r\nthat I should have been wet up to my knees, if I should have come so\r\nfar on foot.\" She replied that \"she scorned to have a drabbled tail.\"\r\nThe good woman who treated Susanna Martin on this occasion with such\r\nhospitable kindness received the impression, as appears by the import\r\nof her deposition, that, because Martin came into the house so\r\nwonderfully dry, she was therefore a witch. The only inference we are\r\nlikely to draw is, that she was a particularly neat person; careful to\r\npick her[ii.146] way; and did not wear skirts of the dimensions of our\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe language reported by this witness to have been used by Susanna\r\nMartin created in her, at the time, visible mortification, as well as\r\nresentment. A writer at the period, not by any means inclined to give a\r\nrepresentation favorable to the prisoners, reports her expression thus:\r\n\"She scorned to be drabbled.\" She was undoubtedly a woman who spoke her\r\nmind freely, and with strength of expression, as the magistrates found.\r\nFrom this cause, perhaps, she had shocked the prejudices and violated\r\nthe conventional scrupulosities then prevalent, to such a degree as to\r\nincur much comment, if not scandal. There had been a good deal of\r\ngossip about her; and, some time before, she had been proceeded against\r\nas a witch. But there was no ground for any serious charges against her\r\ncharacter. Like Mrs. Ann Hibbens, perhaps the head and front of her\r\noffending was that she had more wit than her neighbors. She certainly\r\nwas a strong-minded woman, as her examination shows. Two reports of it,\r\neach in the handwriting of Parris, have come down to us. They are\r\nalmost identical, and in substance as follows:—\r\n\r\nOn the appearance of the accused, many of the witnesses against her\r\ninstantly fell into fits. The magistrate inquired of them,—\r\n\r\n\"Hath this woman hurt you?\"\r\n\r\n\"(Abigail Williams declared that she had hurt her[ii.147] often. 'Ann\r\nPutnam threw her glove at her in a fit,' and the rest were struck dumb\r\nat her presence.)\r\n\r\n\"What! do you laugh at it? said the magistrate.—Well I may at such\r\nfolly.\r\n\r\n\"Is this folly to see these so hurt?—I never hurt man, woman, or child.\r\n\r\n\"(Mercy Lewis cried out, 'She hath hurt me a great many times, and\r\nplucks me down.' Then Martin laughed again. Several others cried out\r\nupon her, and the magistrate again addressed her.)\r\n\r\n\"What do you say to this?—I have no hand in witchcraft.\r\n\r\n\"What did you do? did you consent these should be hurt?—No, never in my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\"What ails these people?—I do not know.\r\n\r\n\"But what do you think ails them?—I do not desire to spend my judgment\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think they are bewitched?—No: I do not think they are.\r\n\r\n\"Well, tell us your thoughts about them.—My thoughts are mine own when\r\nthey are in; but, when they are out, they are another's.\r\n\r\n\"Who do you think is their master?—If they be dealing in the black art,\r\nyou may know as well as I.\r\n\r\n\"What have you done towards the hurt of these?—I have done nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it is you, or your appearance.—I cannot help it.\r\n\r\n\"How comes your appearance just now to hurt these?—How do I know?\r\n\r\n\"Are you not willing to tell the truth?—I cannot tell. He that appeared\r\nin Samuel's shape can appear in any one's shape.[ii.148]\r\n\r\n\"Do you believe these afflicted persons do not say true?—They may lie,\r\nfor aught I know.\r\n\r\n\"May not you lie?—I dare not tell a lie, if it would save my life.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point, the marshal declared that \"she pinched her hands, and\r\nElizabeth Hubbard was immediately afflicted. Several of the afflicted\r\ncried out that they saw her upon the beam\" of the meeting-house over\r\ntheir heads; and there was, no doubt, a scene of frightful excitement.\r\nThe magistrate, in the depth of his awe and distress, earnestly\r\nappealed to the accused, \"Pray God discover you, if you be guilty.\"\r\nNothing daunted, she replied, \"Amen, amen. A false tongue will never\r\nmake a guilty person.\" A great uproar then arose. The accusers fell\r\ninto dreadful convulsions, among the rest John Indian, who cried out,\r\n\"She bites, she bites!\" The magistrate, overcome by the sight of these\r\nsufferings, again appealed to her, \"Have not you compassion for these\r\nafflicted?\" She calmly and firmly answered, \"No: I have none.\" The\r\nuproar rose higher. The accusers all declared that they saw the \"black\r\nman,\" Satan himself, standing by her side. They pretended to try to\r\napproach her, but were suddenly deprived of the power of locomotion.\r\nJohn Indian attempted to rush upon her, but fell sprawling upon the\r\nfloor. The magistrate again appealed to her: \"What is the reason these\r\ncannot come near you?\"—\"I cannot tell. It may be the Devil bears me\r\nmore malice than another.\"—\"Do[ii.149] you not see God evidently\r\ndiscovering you?\"—\"No, not a bit for that.\"—\"All the congregation\r\nbesides think so.\"—\"Let them think what they will.\"—\"What is the reason\r\nthese cannot come to you?\"—\"I do not know but they can, if they will;\r\nor else, if you please, I will come to them.\"—\"What was that the black\r\nman whispered to you?\"—\"There was none whispered to me.\" She was\r\ncommitted to prison.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while, preparations had been going on to bring upon the\r\nstage a more striking character, and give to the excited public mind a\r\ngreater shock than had yet been experienced. Intimations had been\r\nthrown out that higher culprits than had been so far brought to light\r\nwere in reserve, and would, in due time, be unmasked. It was hinted\r\nthat a minister had joined the standard of the Arch-enemy, and was\r\nleading the devilish confederacy. In the accounts given of the\r\ndiabolical sacraments, a man in black had been described, but no name\r\nyet given. As Charles the Second, while they were hanging the\r\nregicides, at the Restoration, was looking about for a preacher to\r\nhang, and used Hugh Peters for the occasion; so the \"afflicted\r\nchildren,\" or those acting behind them, wanted a minister to complete\r\nthe _dramatis personæ_ of their tragedy. His connection with the\r\nsociety and its controversies, and the animosities which had thus\r\nbecome attached to him, naturally suggested Mr. Burroughs. He was then\r\npursuing, as usual, a laborious, humble, self-sacrificing ministry, in\r\nthe midst of perils and privations, away[ii.150] down in the frontier\r\nsettlements on the coast of Maine, and little dreamed of what was\r\nbrewing, for his ruin and destruction, in his former parish at the\r\nvillage. This is what Thomas Putnam had in his mind when he spoke of a\r\n\"wheel within a wheel,\" and \"the high and dreadful\" things not then\r\ndisclosed that were to make \"ears tingle.\"\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to be at once cautious and rapid in their movements,\r\nto prevent the public from getting information which, by reaching the\r\nears of Burroughs, might put him on his guard. It was no easy thing to\r\nsecure him at the great distance of his place of residence. If he\r\nshould become apprised of what was going on, his escape into remoter\r\nand inaccessible settlements would have baffled the whole scheme.\r\nNothing therefore was done at the village, but the steps to arrest him\r\noriginated at Boston. Elisha Hutchinson, a magistrate there, issued the\r\nproper order, addressed to John Partridge of Portsmouth, Field-marshal\r\nof the provinces of New Hampshire and Maine, dated April 30, 1692, to\r\narrest George Burroughs, \"preacher at Wells;\" he being \"suspected of a\r\nconfederacy with the Devil.\" Partridge was directed to deliver him to\r\nthe custody of the marshal of Essex, or, not meeting him, was requested\r\nto bring him to Salem, and hand him over to the magistrates there. The\r\n\"afflicted children\" had begun, shortly before, to use his name.\r\nAbigail Hobbs had resided some years before at Casco; and from her they\r\nobtained all the scandal she had heard there, or chose to fabricate to\r\nsuit the[ii.151] purpose of the prosecutors. The way in which the minds\r\nof the deluded people were worked up against Mr. Burroughs is\r\nillustrated in a deposition subsequently made to this effect:—\r\n\r\nBenjamin Hutchinson testified, that, on the 21st of April, 1692, about\r\neleven o'clock in the forenoon, Abigail Williams told him that she saw\r\na person whom she described as Mr. George Burroughs, \"a little black\r\nminister that lived at Casco Bay.\" Mr. Burroughs was of small stature\r\nand dark complexion. She gave an account of his wonderful feats of\r\nstrength, said that he was a wizard; and that he \"had killed three\r\nwives, two for himself and one for Mr. Lawson.\" She affirmed that she\r\nsaw him then. Mr. Burroughs, it will be borne in mind, was at this time\r\na hundred miles away, at his home in Maine. Hutchinson asked her where\r\nshe saw him. She said \"There,\" pointing to a rut in the road made by a\r\ncart-wheel. He had an iron fork in his hand, and threw it where she\r\nsaid Burroughs was standing. Instantly she fell into a fit; and, when\r\nshe came out of it, said, \"'You have torn his coat, for I heard it\r\ntear.'—'Whereabouts?' said I. 'On one side,' said she. Then we came\r\ninto the house of Lieutenant Ingersoll; and I went into the great room,\r\nand Abigail came in and said, 'There he stands.' I said, 'Where?\r\nwhere?' and presently drew my rapier.\" Then Abigail said, he has gone,\r\nbut \"'there is a gray cat.' Then I said, 'Whereabouts?' 'There!' said\r\nshe, 'there!' Then I struck with my rapier, and she fell into a fit;\r\nand, when it[ii.152] was over, she said, 'You killed her.'\" Poor\r\nHutchinson could not see the cat he had killed any more than\r\nBurroughs's coat he had torn. Abigail explained the mystery to his\r\nsatisfaction, by saying that the spectre of Sarah Good had come in at\r\nthe moment, and carried away the dead cat. This was all in broad\r\ndaylight; it being, as Hutchinson testified, \"about twelve o'clock.\"\r\nThe same day, \"after lecture, in said Ingersoll's chamber,\" Abigail\r\nWilliams and Mary Walcot were present. They said that \"Goody Hobbs, of\r\nTopsfield, had bit Mary Walcot by the foot.\" Then both fell into a fit;\r\nand on coming out, \"they saw William Hobbs and his wife go both of them\r\nalong the table.\" Hutchinson instantly stabbed, with his rapier, \"Goody\r\nHobbs on her side,\" as the two girls declared. They further said that\r\nthe room was \"full of them,\" that is of witches, in their apparitions;\r\nthen Hutchinson and Eleazer Putnam \"stabbed with their rapiers at a\r\nventure.\" The girls cried out, that they \"had killed a great black\r\nwoman of Stonington, and an Indian who had come with her:\" the girls\r\nsaid further, \"The floor is all covered with blood;\" and, rushing to\r\nthe window, declared that they saw a great company of witches on a\r\nhill, and that three of them \"lay dead\" there,—\"the black woman, the\r\nIndian, and one more that they knew not.\" This was about four o'clock\r\nin the afternoon. This evidence was given and received in court. It\r\nshows the audacity with which the girls imposed upon the credulity of a\r\npeople wrought up by their arts to the highest pitch of in[ii.153]sane\r\ninfatuation; and illustrates a condition of things, at that time and\r\nplace, that is truly astonishing.\r\n\r\nOn the evening before Hutchinson was imposed upon, as just described,\r\nby Abigail Williams and Mary Walcot, Ann Putnam had made most\r\nastonishing disclosures, at her father's house, in his presence and\r\nthat of Peter Prescott, Robert Morrel, and Ezekiel Cheever. An account\r\nof the affair was drawn up by her father, and sworn to by her, in these\r\nwords:—\r\n\r\n\"The Deposition of Ann Putnam, who testifieth and saith, on the 20th of\r\nApril, 1692, at evening, she saw the apparition of a minister, at which\r\nshe was grievously affrighted, and cried out, 'Oh, dreadful, dreadful!\r\nhere is a minister come! What! are ministers witches too? Whence came\r\nyou, and what is your name? for I will complain of you, though you be a\r\nminister, if you be a wizard.' Immediately I was tortured by him, being\r\nracked and almost choked by him. And he tempted me to write in his\r\nbook, which I refused with loud outcries, and said I would not write in\r\nhis book though he tore me all to pieces, but told him it was a\r\ndreadful thing that he, which was a minister, that should teach\r\nchildren to fear God, should come to persuade poor creatures to give\r\ntheir souls to the Devil. 'Oh, dreadful, dreadful! Tell me your name,\r\nthat I may know who you are.' Then again he tortured me, and urged me\r\nto write in his book, which I refused. And then, presently, he told me\r\nthat his name was George Burroughs, and that he had had three wives,\r\nand that he had bewitched the two first of them to death; and that he\r\nkilled Mrs. Lawson, because she was so unwilling to go from the\r\nVillage, and also killed Mr. Lawson's child because he went[ii.154] to\r\nthe eastward with Sir Edmon, and preached so to the soldiers; and that\r\nhe had bewitched a great many soldiers to death at the eastward when\r\nSir Edmon was there; and that he had made Abigail Hobbs a witch, and\r\nseveral witches more. And he has continued ever since, by times,\r\ntempting me to write in his book, and grievously torturing me by\r\nbeating, pinching, and almost choking me several times a day. He also\r\ntold me that he was above a witch. He was a conjurer.\"\r\n\r\nHer father and the other persons present made oath that they saw and\r\nheard all this at the time; that \"they beheld her tortures and\r\nperceived her hellish temptations by her loud outcries, 'I will not, I\r\nwill not write, though you torment me all the days of my life.'\" It\r\nwill be observed that this was the evening before Thomas Putnam wrote\r\nhis letter to the magistrates, preparing them for something \"high and\r\ndreadful\" that was soon to be brought to light.\r\n\r\nA similar scene took place not long afterwards, in the presence of her\r\nfather and her uncle Edward, to which they also testify. It was thus\r\ndescribed by her under oath:—\r\n\r\n\"The Deposition of Ann Putnam, who testifieth and saith, that, on the\r\n8th of May, at evening, I saw the apparition of Mr. George Burroughs,\r\nwho grievously tortured me, and urged me to write in his book, which I\r\nrefused. He then told me that his two first wives would appear to me\r\npresently, and tell me a great many lies, but I should not believe\r\nthem. Then immediately appeared to me the forms of two women in\r\nwinding-sheets, and napkins about[ii.155] their heads, at which I was\r\ngreatly affrighted; and they turned their faces towards Mr. Burroughs,\r\nand looked very red and angry, and told him that he had been a cruel\r\nman to them, and that their blood did cry for vengeance against him;\r\nand also told him that they should be clothed with white robes in\r\nheaven, when he should be cast into hell: and immediately he vanished\r\naway. And, as soon as he was gone, the two women turned their faces\r\ntowards me, and looked as pale as a white wall; and told me that they\r\nwere Mr. Burroughs's two first wives, and that he had murdered them.\r\nAnd one of them told me that she was his first wife, and he stabbed her\r\nunder the left arm, and put a piece of sealing-wax on the wound. And\r\nshe pulled aside the winding-sheet, and showed me the place; and also\r\ntold me, that she was in the house where Mr. Parris now lives, when it\r\nwas done. And the other told me, that Mr. Burroughs and that wife which\r\nhe hath now, killed her in the vessel, as she was coming to see her\r\nfriends, because they would have one another. And they both charged me\r\nthat I should tell these things to the magistrates before Mr.\r\nBurroughs' face; and, if he did not own them, they did not know but\r\nthey should appear there. This morning, also, Mrs. Lawson and her\r\ndaughter Ann appeared to me, whom I knew, and told me Mr. Burroughs\r\nmurdered them. This morning also appeared to me another woman in a\r\nwinding-sheet, and told me that she was Goodman Fuller's first wife,\r\nand Mr. Burroughs killed her because there was some difference between\r\nher husband and him.\"\r\n\r\nThis was indeed most extraordinary language and imagery to have been\r\nused by a child of twelve years of age. It is not strange, that, upon a\r\ncommunity,[ii.156] whose fancies and fears had been so long wrought\r\nupon, holding their views, the effect was awfully great. The very fact\r\nthat it was a child that spoke made her declarations seem supernatural.\r\nThen, again, they were accompanied with such ocular demonstration, in\r\nher terrible bodily sufferings, that none remained in doubt of the\r\ntruthfulness and reality of what they listened to and beheld. It did\r\nnot enter their imaginations, for a moment, that there was any\r\ndeception or imposture, or even delusion, on her part. Her case is\r\ntruly a problem not easily solved even now. While we are filled with\r\nhorror and indignation at the thought that she figures as a capital and\r\nfatal witness in all the trials, it is impossible not to feel that a\r\nwisdom greater than ours is necessary to fathom the dark mystery of the\r\nphenomena presented by her and her mother and other accusers, in this\r\nmonstrous and terrible affair.\r\n\r\nThese occurrences, happening just before Mr. Burroughs was brought to\r\nthe village as a prisoner, were bruited from house to house, from mouth\r\nto mouth, and worked the people to a state of horrified exasperation\r\nagainst him; and he was met with execration, when, on the 4th of May,\r\nField-marshal Partridge appeared with him at Salem, and delivered him\r\nto the jailer there. When we consider the distance and the\r\ncircumstances of travel at that time, it is evident that the officers\r\ncharged with the service acted with the greatest promptitude, celerity,\r\nand energy. The tradition is, that they found Mr. Burroughs in his\r\nhumble[ii.157] home, partaking of his frugal meal; that he was snatched\r\nfrom the table without a moment's opportunity to provide for his\r\nfamily, or prepare himself for the journey, and hurried on his way\r\nroughly, and without the least explanation of what it all meant. As\r\nsoon as it was known that he was in jail in Salem, arrangements were\r\ncommenced for his examination. The public mind was highly excited; and\r\nit was determined to make the occasion as impressive, effective, and\r\nawe-striking as possible. Another \"field-day\" was to be had. On the 9th\r\nof May, a special session of the Magistracy was held,—William Stoughton\r\ncoming from Dorchester, and Samuel Sewall from Boston, to sit with\r\nHathorne and Corwin, and give greater solemnity and severity to the\r\nproceedings. Stoughton presided. The first step in the proceedings was\r\nto have a private hearing, in the presence of the magistrates and\r\nministers only; and the report of what passed there gives proof of what\r\nis indicated more or less clearly in several passages in the accounts\r\nthat have come down to us in reference to Mr. Burroughs,—that he was\r\nregarded as not wholly sound in doctrine on points not connected with\r\nwitchcraft, was treated with special severity on that account, and made\r\nthe victim of bigoted prejudice among his brethren and in the churches.\r\nIn this secret inquisition, he was called to account for not attending\r\nthe communion service on one or two occasions; he being a member of the\r\nchurch at Roxbury. It was also brought against him, that none of his\r\nchildren but the eldest had been[ii.158] baptized. What the facts, in\r\nthese respects, were, it is impossible to say; as we know of them only\r\nthrough the charges of his enemies. After this, he was carried to the\r\nplace of public meeting; and, as he entered the room, \"many, if not\r\nall, the bewitched were grievously tortured.\" After the confusion had\r\nsubsided, Susanna Sheldon testified that Burroughs' two wives had\r\nappeared to her \"in their winding-sheets,\" and said, \"That man killed\r\nthem.\" He was ordered to look on the witness; and, as he turned to do\r\nso, he \"knocked down,\" as the reporter affirms, \"all (or most) of the\r\nafflicted that stood behind him.\" Ann Putnam, and the several other\r\n\"afflicted children,\" bore their testimony in a similar strain against\r\nhim, interspersing at intervals, all their various convulsions,\r\noutcries, and tumblings. Mercy Lewis had \"a dreadful and tedious fit.\"\r\nWalcot, Hubbard, and Sheldon were cast into torments simultaneously. At\r\nlength, they were \"so tortured\" that \"authority ordered them\" to be\r\nremoved. Their sufferings were greater than the magistrates and people\r\ncould longer endure to look upon. The question was put to Burroughs,\r\n\"what he thought of these things.\" He answered, \"it was an amazing and\r\nhumbling providence, but he understood nothing of it.\" Throwing aside\r\nall the foolish and ridiculous gossip and all the monstrous fables that\r\nbelong to the accusations against him, and looking at the only known\r\nfacts in his history, it appears that Mr. Burroughs was a man of\r\ningenuous nature, free from guile, unsuspicious of guile in[ii.159]\r\nothers; a disinterested, humble, patient, and generous person. He had\r\nsuffered much wrong, and endured great hardships in life; but they had\r\nnot impaired his readiness to labor and suffer for others. There was no\r\ncombativeness or vindictiveness in his disposition. Even in the midst\r\nof the unspeakable outrages he was experiencing on this occasion, he\r\ndoes not appear to be incensed or irritated, but simply \"amazed.\" To\r\nhave such horrid crimes laid to him, instead of rousing a violent\r\nspirit within him, impressed him with a humbling sense of an\r\ninscrutable Providence. There is a remarkable similarity in the manner\r\nin which Rebecca Nurse and George Burroughs received the dreadful\r\naccusations brought against them. \"Surely,\" she said, \"what sin hath\r\nGod found out in me unrepented of that he should lay such an affliction\r\nupon me in my old age?\" His words are, \"It is an humbling providence of\r\nGod.\" The more we reflect upon this language, and go to the depths of\r\nthe spirit that suggested it, the more we realize, that, in each case,\r\nit arose from a sanctified Christian heart, and is an attestation in\r\nvindication and in honor of the sufferers from whose lips it fell, that\r\noutweighs all passions and prejudices, reverses all verdicts, and\r\ncommands the conviction of all fair and honest minds.\r\n\r\nAfter the \"afflicted\" had been sent out of the room, there was\r\ntestimony to show that Mr. Burroughs had given proof of physical\r\nstrength, which, in a man of his small stature, was sure evidence that\r\nhe was in league with the Devil. Many marvellous statements[ii.160]\r\nwere made to this effect, some of the most extravagant of which he\r\ndenied. He undoubtedly was a person of great strength. He had\r\ncultivated muscular exercise and development while an undergraduate at\r\nCambridge, and was early celebrated as a gymnast. After a while, the\r\naccusers and afflicted were again brought in. Abigail Hobbs testified\r\nthat she was present at a \"witch meeting, in the field near Mr.\r\nParris's house,\" in which Mr. Burroughs acted a conspicuous part. Mary\r\nWarren swore that \"Mr. Burroughs had a trumpet which he blew to summon\r\nthe witches to their feasts\" and other meetings \"near Mr. Parris's\r\nhouse.\" This trumpet had a sound that reached over the country far and\r\nwide, sending its blasts to Andover, and wakening its echoes along the\r\nMerrimack, to Cape Ann, and the uttermost settlements everywhere; so\r\nthat the witches, hearing it, would mount their brooms, and alight, in\r\na moment, in Mr. Parris's orchard, just to the north and west of the\r\nparsonage; but its sound was not heard by any other ears than those of\r\nconfederates with Satan. While the girls were giving their testimony,\r\nevery once in a while they would be dreadfully choked, appearing to be\r\nin the last stages of suffocation and strangulation; and, coming to, at\r\nintervals, would charge it upon Burroughs or other witches, calling\r\nthem by name; generally, however, confining their selection to persons\r\nalready apprehended, and not bringing in others until measures were\r\nmatured. Mr. Burroughs was committed for trial.[ii.161]\r\n\r\nThe examination of Mr. Burroughs presented a spectacle, all things\r\nconsidered, of rare interest and curiosity,—the grave dignity of the\r\nmagistrates; the plain, dark figure of the prisoner; the half-crazed,\r\nhalf-demoniac aspect of the girls; the wild, excited crowd; the horror,\r\nrage, and pallid exasperation of Lawson, Goodman Fuller and others,\r\nalso of the relatives and friends of Burroughs's two former wives, as\r\nthe deep damnation of their taking off and the secrets of their bloody\r\ngraves were being brought to light; and the child on the stand telling\r\nher awful tale of ghosts in winding-sheets, with napkins round their\r\nheads, pointing to their death-wounds, and saying that \"their blood did\r\ncry for vengeance\" upon their murderer. The prisoner stands alone: all\r\nwere raving around him, while he is amazed; astounded at such folly and\r\nwrong in others, and humbly sensible of his own unworthiness; bowed\r\ndown under the mysterious Providence, that permitted such things for a\r\nseason, yet strong and steadfast in conscious innocence and\r\nuprightness.\r\n\r\nTo complete the proceedings against Burroughs at this time, and raise\r\nto the highest point the public abhorrence of him, effective use was\r\nmade of Deliverance Hobbs, the wife of William Hobbs, of whom I have\r\nspoken before. She was first examined April 22. During the earlier part\r\nof the proceedings, she maintained her integrity and protested her\r\ninnocence in a manner which shows that her self-possession held good.\r\nBut the examination was protracted; her[ii.162] strength was exhausted;\r\nthe declarations of the accusers, their dreadful sufferings, the\r\nprejudgment of the case against her by the magistrates, and the\r\ncombined influences of all the circumstances around her, broke her\r\ndown. Her firmness, courage, and truth fled; and she began to confess\r\nall that was laid to her charge. The record is interesting as showing\r\nhow gradually she was overwhelmed and overcome. But while mentioning\r\nthe names of others whom she pretended to have been associated with as\r\nwitches, she did not speak of Burroughs. She referred to those who had\r\nbeen brought out before that date, but not to him. The intended\r\nmovement against him had not then been divulged. On the 3d of May, the\r\nday before he arrived, after it was known that officers had been sent\r\nto arrest him, she was examined again. On this occasion, she charged\r\nBurroughs with having been present, and taken a leading part in\r\nwitch-meetings, which she had described in detail, at her first\r\nexamination, without mentioning him at all. This proves that the\r\nconfessing prisoners were apprised of what it was desired they should\r\nsay, and that their testimony was prepared for them by the managers of\r\nthe affair. The following is one of the confessions made by this woman,\r\nsubsequent to her public examination. I give it partly to show what a\r\nflood of falsehood was poured upon Burroughs, and partly because it\r\nwill serve as a specimen of the stuff of which the confessions were\r\ncomposed:[ii.163]—\r\n\r\n\"_The First Examination of Deliverance Hobbs in Prison._—She continued\r\nin the free acknowledging herself to be a covenant witch: and further\r\nconfesseth she was warned to a meeting yesterday morning, and that\r\nthere was present Procter and his wife, Goody Nurse, Giles Corey and\r\nhis wife, Goody Bishop alias Oliver; and Mr. Burroughs was their\r\npreacher, and pressed them to bewitch all in the village, telling them\r\nthey should do it gradually, and not all at once, assuring them they\r\nshould prevail. He administered the sacrament unto them at the same\r\ntime, with red bread and red wine like blood. She affirms she saw\r\nOsburn, Sarah Good, Goody Wilds, Goody Nurse: and Goody Wilds\r\ndistributed the bread and wine; and a man in a long-crowned white hat\r\nsat next the minister, and they sat seemingly at a table, and they\r\nfilled out the wine in tankards. The notice of this meeting was given\r\nher by Goody Wilds. She, herself affirms, did not nor would not eat nor\r\ndrink, but all the rest did, who were there present; therefore they\r\nthreatened to torment her. The meeting was in the pasture by Mr.\r\nParris's house, and she saw when Abigail Williams ran out to speak with\r\nthem; but, by that time Abigail was come a little distance from the\r\nhouse, this examinant was struck blind, so that she saw not with whom\r\nAbigail spake. She further saith, that Goody Wilds, to prevail with her\r\nto sign, told her, that, if she would put her hand to the book, she\r\nwould give her some clothes, and would not afflict her any more. Her\r\ndaughter, Abigail Hobbs, being brought in at the same time, while her\r\nmother was present, was immediately taken with a dreadful fit; and her\r\nmother, being asked who it was that hurt her daughter, answered it was\r\nGoodman Corey, and she saw him and the gentlewoman of Boston striving\r\nto break her daughter's neck.\" [ii.164]\r\n\r\nOn the next day, warrants were procured against George Jacobs, Sr., and\r\nhis grand-daughter, Margaret Jacobs. They were forthwith seized and\r\nbrought in by Constable Joseph Neal, of Salem, whose return is as\r\nfollows: \"May 10, 1692. Then I apprehended the bodies of George Jacobs,\r\nSr., and Margaret, daughter of George Jacobs, Jr., according to the\r\ntenor of the above warrant.\" The examinations, on this occasion, were\r\nheld at the house of Thomas Beadle, in the town of Salem. All the\r\npreliminary examinations, so far as existing documents show, were\r\neither in the meeting-house at the village or that of the town; or at\r\nthe house of Nathaniel Ingersoll at the village, or Thomas Beadle in\r\nthe town,—both being inns, or places of public entertainment. Beadle's\r\nhouse was on the south side of Essex Street, on land now occupied by\r\nNos. 63 and 65. The eastern boundary of the lot was forty-nine feet\r\nfrom Ingersoll's Lane, now Daniels Street. Its front on Essex Street\r\nwas about sixty feet, and its depth about one hundred and forty-five\r\nfeet. What is now No. 65 is on the very spot where Beadle's tavern\r\nstood; and with the exception of six feet built, as an addition, on the\r\neastern side, subsequently to 1733, is probably the identical house.\r\nThe ground now occupied by No. 63 was then an open space. It appears by\r\nbills of expenses brought \"against the country,\" that the inn of Samuel\r\nBeadle, a brother of Thomas, was also sometimes used for purposes\r\nconnected with the prosecutions. Thomas Beadle's bill amounted to £58.\r\n11_s._ 5_d._; that of Samuel to £21. The latter, being[ii.165] near the\r\njail, was probably used for the entertainment of constables and the\r\nkeeping of their horses, as well as other incidental purposes connected\r\nwith the transportation of prisoners.\r\n\r\nA tradition has long prevailed, that the house, still standing, of\r\nJudge Jonathan Corwin, at the western corner of North and Essex\r\nStreets, was used at these examinations. One form in which this\r\ntradition has come down is probably correct. The grand jury was often\r\nin session while the jury for trials was hearing cases in the\r\nCourt-house. There may not have been suitable accommodations for both\r\nin that building. The confused sounds and commotions incident to the\r\ntrials would have been annoying to the grand jury. The tradition is,\r\nthat a place was provided and used temporarily by that body, in the\r\nCorwin house, supposed to have been the spacious room at the\r\nsoutheastern corner. As the investigations of the grand jury were not\r\nopen to the public, its occasional sittings would not be seriously\r\nincompatible with the convenience of a family, or detrimental to the\r\ngrounds or apartments of a handsome private residence. Indeed, it would\r\nhardly have been allowable or practicable to have had the examinations\r\nbefore the magistrates in any other than a public house. They were\r\nalways frequented by a promiscuous crowd, and generally scenes of\r\ntumultuary disorder.\r\n\r\nGeorge Jacobs, Sr., was an aged man. He is represented in the evidence\r\nas \"very gray-headed;\" and he must have been quite infirm, for he\r\nwalked with two[ii.166] staffs. His hair was in long, thin, white\r\nlocks; and, as he was uncommonly tall of stature, he must have had a\r\nvenerable aspect. Perhaps he was the \"man in a long-crowned white hat,\"\r\nreferred to by Deliverance Hobbs. The examination shows that his\r\nfaculties were vigorous, his bearing fearless, and his utterances\r\nstrong and decided. The magistrates began: \"Here are them that accuse\r\nyou of acts of witchcraft.\"—\"Well, let us hear who are they and what\r\nare they.\" When Abigail Williams testified against him, going through\r\nundoubtedly her usual operations, he could not refrain from expressing\r\nhis contempt for the whole thing by a laugh; explaining it by saying,\r\n\"Because I am falsely accused—your worships all of you, do you think\r\nthis is true?\" They answered, \"Nay: what do you think?\" \"I never did\r\nit.\"—\"Who did it?\"—\"Don't ask me.\" The magistrates always took it for\r\ngranted that the pretensions and sufferings of the girls were real, and\r\nthrew upon the accused the responsibility of explaining them. They\r\ncontinued: \"Why should we not ask you? Sarah Churchill accuseth you.\r\nThere she is.\" Jacobs was of opinion that it was not for him to explain\r\nthe actions of the girls, but for the prosecuting party to prove his\r\nguilt. \"If you can prove that I am guilty, I will lie under it.\" Then\r\nSarah Churchill, who was a servant in his family, said, \"Last night, I\r\nwas afflicted at Deacon Ingersoll's; and Mary Walcot said it was a man\r\nwith two staves: it was my master.\" It seems, that, after the\r\nproceedings against Burroughs were over, a meeting of \"the circle\" took\r\nplace in the[ii.167] evening, at Deacon Ingersoll's, at which there was\r\na repetition of the actings of the girls; and that Mary Walcot\r\nsuggested to Churchill to accuse her master. This shows the way in\r\nwhich the delusion was kept up. Probably, such meetings were held at\r\none house or another in the village, and fresh accusations brought\r\nforward, continually. Jacobs appealed to the magistrates, trying to\r\nrecall them to a sense of fairness. \"Pray, do not accuse me: I am as\r\nclear as your worships. You must do right judgment.\" Sarah Churchill\r\ncharged him with having hurt her; and the magistrates, pushing her on\r\nto make further charges, said to her, \"Did he not appear on the other\r\nside of the river, and hurt you? Did not you see him?\" She answered,\r\n\"Yes, he did.\" Then, turning to him, the magistrates said, \"There, she\r\naccuseth you to your face: she chargeth you that you hurt her\r\ntwice.\"—\"It is not true. What would you have me say? I never wronged no\r\nman in word nor deed.\"—\"Is it no harm to afflict these?\"—\"I never did\r\nit.\"—\"But how comes it to be in your appearance?\"—\"The Devil can take\r\nany likeness.\"—\"Not without their consent.\" Jacobs rejected the\r\nimputation. \"You tax me for a wizard: you may as well tax me for a\r\nbuzzard. I have done no harm.\" Churchill said, \"I know you lived a\r\nwicked life.\" Jacobs, turning to the magistrates, said, \"Let her make\r\nit out.\" The magistrates asked her, \"Doth he ever pray in his family?\"\r\nShe replied, \"Not unless by himself.\" The magistrates, addressing him:\r\n\"Why do you not pray in your family?\"—\"I cannot[ii.168] read.\"—\"Well,\r\nbut you may pray for all that. Can you say the Lord's Prayer? Let us\r\nhear you.\" The reporter, Mr. Parris, says, \"He missed in several parts\r\nof it, and could not repeat it right after many trials.\" The\r\nmagistrates, addressing her, said, \"Were you not frighted, Sarah\r\nChurchill, when the representation of your master came to you?\"—\"Yes.\"\r\nJacobs exclaimed, \"Well, burn me or hang me, I will stand in the truth\r\nof Christ: I know nothing of it.\" In answer to an inquiry from the\r\nmagistrates, he denied having done any thing to get his son George or\r\ngrand-daughter Margaret to \"sign the book.\"\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the old man, his intrepid bearing, and the stamp of\r\nconscious innocence on all he said, probably produced some impression\r\non the magistrates, as they did not come to any decision, but adjourned\r\nthe examination to the next day. The girls then came down from the\r\nvillage in full force, determined to put him through. When he was\r\nbrought in, they accordingly, all at once, \"fell into the most grievous\r\nfits and screechings.\" When they sufficiently came to, the magistrates\r\nturned to the girls: \"Is this the man that hurts you?\" They severally\r\nanswered,—Abigail Williams: \"This is the man,\" and fell into a violent\r\nfit. Ann Putnam: \"This is the man. He hurts me, and brings the book to\r\nme, and would have me write in the book, and said, if I would write in\r\nit, I should be as well as his grand-daughter.\" Mercy Lewis, after much\r\ninterruptions by fits: \"This is the man: he almost kills me.\" Elizabeth\r\nHubbard: \"He[ii.169] never hurt me till to-day, when he came upon the\r\ntable.\" Mary Walcot, after much interruption by fits: \"This is the man:\r\nhe used to come with two staves, and beat me with one of them.\" After\r\nall this, the magistrates, thinking he could deny it no longer, turn to\r\nhim, \"What do you say? Are you not a witch?\" \"No: I know it not, if I\r\nwere to die presently.\" Mercy Lewis advanced towards him, but, as soon\r\nas she got near, \"fell into great fits.\"—\"What do you say to this?\"\r\ncried the magistrates. \"Why, it is false. I know not of it any more\r\nthan the child that was born to-night.\" The reporter says, \"Ann Putnam\r\nand Abigail Williams had each of them a pin stuck in their hands, and\r\nthey said it was this old Jacobs.\" He was committed to prison.\r\n\r\nThe following piece of evidence is among the loose papers on file in\r\nthe clerk's office:—\r\n\r\n\"The Deposition of Sarah Ingersoll, aged about thirty years.—Saith,\r\nthat, seeing Sarah Churchill after her examination, she came to me\r\ncrying and wringing her hands, seemingly to be much troubled in spirit.\r\nI asked her what she ailed. She answered, she had undone herself. I\r\nasked her in what. She said, in belying herself and others in saying\r\nshe had set her hand to the Devil's book, whereas, she said, she never\r\ndid. I told her I believed she had set her hand to the book. She\r\nanswered, crying, and said, 'No, no, no: I never, I never did.' I asked\r\nher then what made her say she did. She answered, because they\r\nthreatened her, and told her they would put her into the dungeon, and\r\nput her along with Mr. Burroughs; and thus[ii.170] several times she\r\nfollowed me up and down, telling me that she had undone herself, in\r\nbelying herself and others. I asked her why she did not deny she wrote\r\nit. She told me, because she had stood out so long in it, that now she\r\ndurst not. She said also, that, if she told Mr. Noyes but once she had\r\nset her hand to the book, he would believe her; but, if she told the\r\ntruth, and said she had not set her hand to the book a hundred times,\r\nhe would not believe her.\r\n\r\n\"Sarah Ingersoll.\"\r\n\r\nThis paper has also the signature of \"Ann Andrews.\"\r\n\r\nThis incident probably occurred during the examination of George\r\nJacobs; and the bitter compunction of Churchill was in consequence of\r\nthe false and malignant course she had been pursuing against her old\r\nmaster. It is a relief to our feelings, so far as she is regarded, to\r\nsuppose so. Bad as her conduct was as one of the accusers, on other\r\noccasions after I am sorry to say as well as before, it shows that she\r\nwas not entirely dead to humanity, but realized the iniquity of which\r\nshe had been guilty towards him. It is the only instance of which we\r\nfind notice of any such a remnant of conscience showing itself, at the\r\ntime, among those perverted and depraved young persons. The reason, why\r\nit is probable that this exhibition of Churchill's penitential tears\r\nand agonies of remorse occurred immediately after the first day of\r\nJacobs's examination, is this. It was one of the first, if not the\r\nfirst, held at the house of Thomas Beadle. Sarah Ingersoll would not\r\nhave been likely to have fallen in[ii.171] with her elsewhere. It is\r\nevident, from the tenor and purport of the document, that the deponent\r\nwas not entirely carried away by the prevalent delusion, and probably\r\ndid not follow up the proceedings generally. But it was quite natural\r\nthat her attention should have been called to proceedings of interest\r\nat Beadle's house, particularly on that first occasion. She lived in\r\nthe immediate vicinity. The indorsement by Ann Andrews, the daughter of\r\nJacobs, increases the probability that the occurrence was at his\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the family of John Ingersoll,—a brother of\r\nDeacon Nathaniel Ingersoll,—in 1692, occupied a series of houses on the\r\nwest side of Daniels Street, leading from Essex Street to the harbor.\r\nThe widow of John's son Nathaniel lived at the corner of Essex and\r\nDaniels Streets; the next in order was the widow of his son John; the\r\nnext, his daughter Ruth, wife of Richard Rose; the next, the widow of\r\nhis son Richard; the last, his son Samuel, whose house lot extended to\r\nthe water. Sarah, the witness in this case, was the wife of Samuel, and\r\nafterwards became the second wife of Philip English. One of her\r\nchildren appears to have married a son of Beadle. Their immediate\r\nproximity to the Beadle house, and consequent intimacy with his family,\r\nled them to become conversant with what occurred there; and Sarah\r\nIngersoll was, in that way, likely to meet Churchill, and to have the\r\nconversation with her to which she deposes.\r\n\r\nThis brief deposition of Sarah Ingersoll is, in many particulars, an\r\nimportant and instructive paper. It[ii.172] exhibits incidentally the\r\nmeans employed to keep the accusing girls and confessing witnesses from\r\nfalling back, and, by overawing them, to prevent their acknowledging\r\nthe falseness of their testimony. It shows how difficult it was to\r\nobtain a hearing, if they were disposed to recant. It presents Mr.\r\nNoyes—as all along there is too much evidence compelling us to\r\nadmit—acting a part as bad as that of Parris; and it discloses the\r\nfact, that Mr. Burroughs, although not yet brought to trial, was\r\nimmured in a dungeon.\r\n\r\nNo papers are on file, or have been obtained, in reference to the\r\nexamination of Margaret Jacobs, which was at the same time and place\r\nwith that of her grandfather. We shall hear of her in subsequent stages\r\nof the transaction.\r\n\r\nOn the same day—May 10—that George and Margaret Jacobs were apprehended\r\nand examined, a warrant was issued against John Willard, \"husbandman,\"\r\nto be brought to Thomas Beadle's house in Salem. On the 12th, John\r\nPutnam, Jr., constable, made return that he had been to \"the house of\r\nthe usual abode of John Willard, and made search for him, and in\r\nseveral other houses and places, but could not find him;\" and that \"his\r\nrelations and friends\" said, \"that, to their best knowledge, he was\r\nfled.\" On the 15th, a warrant was issued to the marshal of Essex, and\r\nthe constables of Salem, \"or any other marshal, or marshal's constable\r\nor constables within this their majesty's colony or territory of the\r\nMassachusetts, in New England,\" requiring them to apprehend said\r\nWillard, \"if he may be found[ii.173] in your precincts, who stands\r\ncharged with sundry acts of witchcraft, by him done or committed on the\r\nbodies of Bray Wilkins, and Samuel Wilkins, the son of Henry Wilkins,\"\r\nand others, upon complaint made \"by Thomas Fuller, Jr., and Benjamin\r\nWilkins, Sr., yeomen; who, being found, you are to convey from town to\r\ntown, from constable to constable, ... to be prosecuted according to\r\nthe direction of Constable John Putnam, of Salem Village, who goes with\r\nthe same.\" On the 18th of May, Constable Putnam brought in Willard, and\r\ndelivered him to the magistrates. He was seized in Groton. There is no\r\nrecord of his examination; but we gather, from the papers on file, the\r\nfollowing facts relating to this interesting case:—\r\n\r\nIt is said that Willard had been called upon to aid in the arrest,\r\ncustody, and bringing-in of persons accused, acting as a\r\ndeputy-constable; and, from his observation of the deportment of the\r\nprisoners, and from all he heard and saw, his sympathies became excited\r\nin their behalf: and he expressed, in more or less unguarded terms, his\r\ndisapprobation of the proceedings. He seems to have considered all\r\nhands concerned in the business—accusers, accused, magistrates, and\r\npeople—as alike bewitched. One of the witnesses against him deposed,\r\nthat he said, in a \"discourse\" at the house of a relative, \"Hang them:\r\nthey are all witches.\" In consequence of this kind of talk, in which he\r\nindulged as early as April, he incurred the ill-will of the parties\r\nengaged in the prose[ii.174]cutions; and it was whispered about that he\r\nwas himself in the diabolical confederacy. He was a grandson of Bray\r\nWilkins; and the mind of the old man became prejudiced against him, and\r\nmost of his family connections and neighbors partook of the feeling.\r\nWhen Willard discovered that such rumors were in circulation against\r\nhim, he went to his grandfather for counsel and the aid of his prayers.\r\nHe met with a cold reception, as appears by the deposition of the old\r\nman as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"When John Willard was first complained of by the afflicted persons for\r\nafflicting of them, he came to my house, greatly troubled, desiring me,\r\nwith some other neighbors, to pray for him. I told him I was then going\r\nfrom home, and could not stay; but, if I could come home before night,\r\nI should not be unwilling. But it was near night before I came home,\r\nand so I did not answer his desire; but I heard no more of him upon\r\nthat account. Whether my not answering his desire did not offend him, I\r\ncannot tell; but I was jealous, afterwards, that it did.\"\r\n\r\nWillard soon after made an engagement to go to Boston, on\r\nelection-week, with Henry Wilkins, Jr. A son of said Henry Wilkins,\r\nnamed Daniel,—a youth of seventeen years of age, who had heard the\r\nstories against Willard, and believed them all, remonstrated with his\r\nfather against going to Boston with Willard, and seemed much distressed\r\nat the thought, saying, among other things, \"It were well if the said\r\nWillard were hanged.\"\r\n\r\nOld Bray Wilkins must go to election too; and so[ii.175] started off on\r\nhorseback,—the only mode of travel then practicable from Will's Hill to\r\nWinnesimit Ferry,—with his wife on a pillion behind him. He was\r\neighty-two years of age, and she probably not much less; for she had\r\nbeen the wife of his youth. The old couple undoubtedly had an active\r\ntime that week in Boston. It was a great occasion, and the whole\r\ncountry flocked in to partake in the ceremonies and services of the\r\nanniversary. On Election-day, with his wife, he rode out to Dorchester,\r\nto dine at the house of his \"brother, Lieutenant Richard Way.\" Deodat\r\nLawson and his new wife, and several more, joined them at table. Before\r\nsitting down, Henry Wilkins and John Willard also came in. Willard,\r\nperhaps, did not feel very agreeably towards his grandfather, at the\r\ntime, for having shown an unwillingness to pray with him. The old man\r\neither saw, or imagined he saw, a very unpleasant expression in\r\nWillard's countenance. \"To my apprehension, he looked after such a sort\r\nupon me as I never before discerned in any.\" The long and hard travel,\r\nthe fatigues and excitements of election-week, were too much for the\r\nold man, tough and rugged as he was; and a severe attack of a\r\ncomplaint, to which persons of his age are often subject, came on. He\r\nexperienced great sufferings, and, as he expressed it, \"was like a man\r\non a rack.\"\r\n\r\n\"I told my wife immediately that I was afraid that Willard had done me\r\nwrong; my pain continuing, and finding no relief, my jealousy\r\ncontinued. Mr. Lawson and others there were all amazed, and knew not\r\nwhat to do for me. There was[ii.176] a woman accounted skilful came\r\nhoping to help me, and after she had used means, she asked me whether\r\nnone of those evil persons had done me damage. I said, I could not say\r\nthey had, but I was sore afraid they had. She answered, she did fear so\r\ntoo.... As near as I remember. I lay in this case three or four days at\r\nBoston, and afterward, with the jeopardy of my life (as I thought), I\r\ncame home.\"\r\n\r\nOn his return, he found his grandson, the same Daniel who had warned\r\nHenry Wilkins against going to Boston with John Willard, on his\r\ndeath-bed, in great suffering. Another attack of his own malady came\r\non. There was great consternation in the neighborhood, and throughout\r\nthe village. The Devil and his confederates, it was thought, were\r\nmaking an awful onslaught upon the people at Will's Hill. Parris and\r\nothers rushed to the scene. Mercy Lewis and Mary Walcot were carried up\r\nto tell who it was that was bewitching old Bray, and young Daniel, and\r\nothers of the Wilkinses who had caught the contagion, and were\r\nexperiencing or imagining all sorts of bodily ails. They were taken to\r\nthe room where Daniel was approaching his death-agonies; and they both\r\naffirmed, that they saw the spectres of old Mrs. Buckley and John\r\nWillard \"upon his throat and upon his breast, and pressed him and\r\nchoked him;\" and the cruel operation, they insisted upon it, continued\r\nuntil the boy died. The girls were carried to the bedroom of the old\r\nman, who was in great suffering; and, when they entered, the question\r\nwas put by the anxious and excited friends in the chamber to Mercy\r\nLewis, whether[ii.177] she saw any thing. She said, \"Yes: they are\r\nlooking for John Willard.\" Presently she pretended to have caught sight\r\nof his apparition, and exclaimed, \"There he is upon his grandfather's\r\nbelly.\" This was thought wonderful indeed; for, as the old man says in\r\na deposition he drew up afterwards, \"At that time I was in grievous\r\npain in the small of my belly.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Ann Putnam had her story to tell about John Willard. Its substance\r\nis seen in a deposition drawn up about the time, and is in the same\r\nvein as her testimony in other cases; presenting a problem to be solved\r\nby those who can draw the line between semi-insane hallucination and\r\ndownright fabrication. Her deposition is as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"That the shape of Samuel Fuller and Lydia Wilkins this day told me at\r\nmy own house by the bedside, who appeared in winding-sheets, that, if I\r\ndid not go and tell Mr. Hathorne that John Willard had murdered them,\r\nthey would tear me to pieces. I knew them when they were living, and it\r\nwas exactly their resemblance and shape. And, at the same time, the\r\napparition of John Willard told me that he had killed Samuel Fuller,\r\nLydia Wilkins, Goody Shaw, and Fuller's second wife, and Aaron Way's\r\nchild, and Ben Fuller's child; and this deponent's child Sarah, six\r\nweeks old; and Philip Knight's child, with the help of William Hobbs;\r\nand Jonathan Knight's child and two of Ezekiel Cheever's children with\r\nthe help of William Hobbs; Anne Eliot and Isaac Nichols with the help\r\nof William Hobbs; and that if Mr. Hathorne would not believe them,—that\r\nis, Samuel Fuller and Lydia Wilkins,—perhaps they would appear\r\nto[ii.178] the magistrates. Joseph Fuller's apparition the same day\r\nalso came to me, and told me that Goody Corey had killed him. The\r\nspectre aforesaid told me, that vengeance, vengeance, was cried by said\r\nFuller. This relation is true.\r\n\r\n\"Ann Putnam.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears by such papers as are to be found relating to Willard's\r\ncase, that a coroner's jury was held over the body of Daniel Wilkins,\r\nof which Nathaniel Putnam was foreman. It is much to be regretted that\r\nthe finding of that jury is lost. It would be a real curiosity. That it\r\nwas very decisive to the point, affirmed by Mercy Lewis and Mary\r\nWalcot, that Daniel was choked and strangled by the spectres of John\r\nWillard and Goody Buckley, is apparent from the manner in which Bray\r\nWilkins speaks of it. In an argument between him and some persons who\r\nwere expressing their confidence that John Willard was an innocent man,\r\nhe sought to relieve himself from responsibility for Willard's\r\nconviction by saying, \"It was not I, nor my son Benjamin Wilkins, but\r\nthe testimony of the afflicted persons, and the jury concerning the\r\nmurder of my grandson, Daniel Wilkins, that would take away his life,\r\nif any thing did.\" Mr. Parris, of course, was in the midst of these\r\nproceedings at Will's Hill; attended the visits of the afflicted girls\r\nwhen they went to ascertain who were the witches murdering young Daniel\r\nand torturing the old man; was present, no doubt, at the solemn\r\nexaminations and investigations of the sages who sat as a jury of\r\ninquest[ii.179] over the former, and, in all likelihood, made, as\r\nusual, a written report of the same. As soon as he got back to his\r\nhouse, he discharged his mind, and indorsed the verdict of the\r\ncoroner's jury by this characteristic insertion in his church-records:\r\n\"Dan: Wilkins. Bewitched to death.\" The very next entry relates to a\r\ncase of which this obituary line, in Mr. Parris's church-book, is the\r\nonly intimation that has come down to us, \"Daughter to Ann Douglas. By\r\nwitchcraft, I doubt not.\" Willard's examination was at Beadle's, on the\r\n18th. With this deluge of accusations and tempest of indignation\r\nbeating upon him, he had but little chance, and was committed.\r\n\r\nWhile the marshals and constables were in pursuit of Willard, the time\r\nwas well improved by the prosecutors. On the 12th of May, warrants were\r\nissued to apprehend, and bring \"forthwith\" before the magistrates\r\nsitting at Beadle's, \"Alice Parker, the wife of John Parker of Salem;\r\nand Ann Pudeator of Salem, widow.\" Alice, commonly called Elsie, Parker\r\nwas the wife of a mariner. We know but little of her. We have a\r\ndeposition of one woman, Martha Dutch, as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"This deponent testified and saith, that, about two years last past,\r\nJohn Jarman, of Salem, coming in from sea, I (this deponent and Alice\r\nParker, of Salem, both of us standing together) said unto her, 'What a\r\ngreat mercy it was, for to see them come home well; and through mercy,'\r\nI said, 'my husband had gone, and come home well, many times.' And I,\r\nthis deponent, did say unto the said Parker, that 'I[ii.180] did hope\r\nhe would come home this voyage well also.' And the said Parker made\r\nanswer unto me, and said, 'No: never more in this world.' The which\r\ncame to pass as she then told me; for he died abroad, as I certainly\r\nhear.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps Parker had information which had not reached the ears of Dutch,\r\nor she may have been prone to take melancholy views of the dangers to\r\nwhich seafaring people are exposed. It was a strange kind of evidence\r\nto be admitted against a person in a trial for witchcraft.\r\n\r\nSamuel Shattuck, who has been mentioned (vol. i. p. 193) in connection\r\nwith Bridget Bishop, had a long story to tell about Alice Parker. He\r\nseems to have been very active in getting up charges of witchcraft\r\nagainst persons in his neighborhood, and on the most absurd and\r\nfrivolous grounds. Parker had made a friendly call upon his wife; and,\r\nnot long after, one of his children fell sick, and he undertook to\r\nsuspect that it was \"under an evil hand.\" In similar circumstances, he\r\ntook the same grudge against Bridget Bishop. Alice Parker, hearing that\r\nhe had been circulating suspicions to that effect against her, went to\r\nhis house to remonstrate; an angry altercation took place between them;\r\nand he gave his version of the affair in evidence. There was no one to\r\npresent the other side. But the whole thing has, not only a one-sided,\r\nbut an irrelevant character, in no wise bearing upon the point of\r\nwitchcraft. All the gossip, scandal, and tittle-tattle of the\r\nneighborhood for twenty years back, in this case as in others,\r\nwas[ii.181] raked up, and allowed to be adduced, however utterly remote\r\nfrom the questions belonging to the trial.\r\n\r\nThe following singular piece of testimony against Alice Parker may be\r\nmentioned. John Westgate was at Samuel Beadle's tavern one night with\r\nboon companions; among them John Parker, the husband of Alice. She\r\ndisapproved of her husband's spending his evenings in such company, and\r\nin a bar-room; and felt it necessary to put a stop to it, if she could.\r\nWestgate says that she \"came into the company, and scolded at and\r\ncalled her husband all to nought; whereupon I, the said deponent, took\r\nher husband's part, telling her it was an unbeseeming thing for her to\r\ncome after him to the tavern, and rail after that rate. With that she\r\ncame up to me, and called me rogue, and bid me mind my own business,\r\nand told me I had better have said nothing.\" He goes on to state, that,\r\nreturning home one night some time afterwards, he experienced an awful\r\nfright. \"Going from the house of Mr. Daniel King, when I came over\r\nagainst John Robinson's house, I heard a great noise; ... and there\r\nappeared a black hog running towards me with open mouth, as though he\r\nwould have devoured me at that instant time.\" In the extremity of his\r\nterror, he tried to run away from the awful monster; but, as might have\r\nbeen expected under the circumstances, he tumbled to the ground. \"I\r\nfell down upon my hip, and my knife run into my hip up to the haft.\r\nWhen I came home, my knife was in my sheath. When I drew it out of the\r\nsheath, then immediately the sheath fell all[ii.182] to pieces.\" And\r\nfurther this deponent testifieth, that, after he got up from his fall,\r\nhis stocking and shoe was full of blood, and that he was forced to\r\ncrawl along by the fence all the way home; and the hog followed him,\r\nand never left him till he came home. He further stated that he was\r\naccompanied all the way by his \"stout dog,\" which ordinarily was much\r\ninclined to attack and \"worry hogs,\" but, on this occasion, \"ran away\r\nfrom him, leaping over the fence and crying much.\" In view of all these\r\nthings, Westgate concludes his testimony thus: \"Which hog I then\r\napprehended was either the Devil or some evil thing, not a real hog;\r\nand did then really judge, or determine in my mind, that it was either\r\nGoody Parker or by her means and procuring, fearing that she is a\r\nwitch.\" The facts were probably these: The sheath was broken by his\r\nfall, his skin bruised, and some blood got into his stocking and shoe.\r\nThe knife was never out of the sheath until he drew it; there was no\r\nmystery or witchcraft in it. Nothing was ever more natural than the\r\nconduct of the dog. When he saw Westgate frightened out of his wits at\r\nnothing, trying to run as for dear life when there was no pursuer,\r\nstaggering and pitching along in a zigzag direction with very eccentric\r\nmotions, falling heels over head, and then crawling along, holding\r\nhimself up by the fence, and all the time looking back with terror, and\r\nperhaps attempting to express his consternation, the dog could not tell\r\nwhat to make of it; and ran off, as a dog would be likely to have done,\r\njumping over the fences, barking,[ii.183] and uttering the usual canine\r\nejaculations. Dogs sympathize with their masters, and, if there is a\r\nfrolic or other acting going on, are fond of joining in it. The whole\r\nthing was in consequence of Westgate's not having profited by Alice\r\nParker's rebuke, and discontinued his visits by night to Beadle's\r\nbar-room. The only reason why he saw the \"black hog with the open\r\nmouth,\" and the dog did not see it, and therefore failed to come to his\r\nprotection, was because he had been drinking and the dog had not.\r\n\r\nWe find among the papers relating to these transactions many other\r\ninstances of this kind of testimony; sounds heard and sights seen by\r\npersons going home at night through woods, after having spent the\r\nevening under the bewildering influences of talk about witches, Satan,\r\nghosts, and spectres; sometimes, as in this case, stimulated by other\r\ncauses of excitement.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some persons may be curious to know the route by which Westgate\r\nmade out to reach his home, while pursued by the horrors of that\r\nmidnight experience. He seems to have frequented Samuel Beadle's\r\nbar-room. That old Narragansett soldier owned a lot on the west side of\r\nSt. Peter's Street, occupying the southern corner of what is now Church\r\nStreet, which was opened ten years afterwards, that is, in 1702, by the\r\nname of Epps's Lane. On that lot his tavern stood. He also owned\r\none-third of an acre at the present corner of Brown and St. Peter's\r\nStreets, on which he had a stable and barn; so that his grounds were on\r\nboth sides of St. Peter's Street,—one parcel on the west,[ii.184]\r\nnearly opposite the present front of the church; the other on the east\r\nside of St. Peter's Street, opposite the south side of the church. From\r\nthis locality Westgate started. He probably did not go down Brown\r\nStreet, for that was then a dark, unfrequented lane, but thought it\r\nsafest to get into Essex Street. He made his way along that street,\r\npassing the Common, the southern side of which, at that time, with the\r\nexception of some house-lots on and contiguous to the site of the\r\nFranklin Building, bordered on Essex Street. The casualty of his fall;\r\nthe catastrophe to his hip, stocking, and shoe; and the witchery\r\npractised upon his knife and its sheath,—occurred \"over against John\r\nRobinson's house,\" which was on the eastern corner of Pleasant and\r\nEssex Streets. Christopher Babbage's house, from which he thought the\r\n\"great noise\" came, was next beyond Robinson's. He crawled along the\r\nfences and the sides of the houses until he reached the passage-way on\r\nthe western side of Thomas Beadle's house, and through that managed to\r\nget to his own house, which was directly south of said Beadle's lot,\r\nbetween it and the harbor.\r\n\r\nThere is one item in reference to Alice Parker, which indicates that\r\nthe zeal of the prosecutors in her case, as in that of Mr. Burroughs,\r\nand perhaps others, was aggravated by a suspicion that she was\r\nheretical on some points of the prevalent creed of the day. Parris says\r\nthat \"Mr. Noyes, at the time of her examination, affirmed to her face,\r\nthat, he being with her at a time of sickness, discoursing with her\r\nabout[ii.185] witchcraft, whether she were not guilty, she answered,\r\n'if she was as free from other sins as from witchcraft, she would not\r\nask of the Lord mercy.'\" The manner of expression in this passage shows\r\nthat it was thought that there was something very shocking in her\r\nanswer. Mr. Noyes \"affirmed to her face.\" No doubt it was thought that\r\nshe denied the doctrine of original and transmitted, or imputed sin.\r\n\r\nAnn Pudeator (pronounced Pud-e-tor) was the widow of Jacob Pudeator,\r\nand probably about seventy years of age. The name is spelt variously,\r\nand was originally, as it is sometimes found, Poindexter. She was a\r\nwoman of property, owning two estates on the north line of the Common;\r\nthat on which she lived comprised what is between Oliver and Winter\r\nStreets. She was arrested and brought to examination on the 12th of\r\nMay. There is ground to conclude, from the tenor of the documents, that\r\nshe was then discharged. Some people in the town were determined to\r\ngratify their spleen against her, and procured her re-arrest. The\r\nexamination took place on the 2d of July, and she was then committed.\r\nThe evidence was, if possible, more frivolous and absurd than in other\r\ncases. The girls acted their usual parts, giving, on this occasion, a\r\nparticularly striking exhibition of the transmission of the diabolical\r\nvirus out of themselves back into the witch by a touch of her body.\r\n\"Ann Putnam fell into a fit, and said Pudeator was commanded to take\r\nher by the wrist, and did; and said Putnam was well presently. Mary\r\nWarren fell into two fits quickly, after[ii.186] one another; and both\r\ntimes was helped by said Pudeator's taking her by the wrist.\"\r\n\r\nWhen well acted, this must have been one of the most impressive and\r\neffective of all the methods employed in these performances. To see a\r\nyoung woman or girl suddenly struck down, speechless, pallid as in\r\ndeath; with muscles rigid, eyeballs fixed or rolled back in their\r\nsockets; the stiffened frame either wholly prostrate or drawn up into\r\ncontorted attitudes and shapes, or vehemently convulsed with racking\r\npains, or dropping with relaxed muscles into a lifeless lump; and to\r\nhear dread shrieks of delirious ravings,—must have produced a truly\r\nfrightful effect upon an excited and deluded assembly. The constables\r\nand their assistants would go to the rescue, lift the body of the\r\nsufferer, and bear it in their arms towards the prisoner. The\r\nmagistrates and the crowd, hushed in the deepest silence, would watch\r\nwith breathless awe the result of the experiment, while the officers\r\nslowly approached the accused, who, when they came near, would, in\r\nobedience to the order of the magistrates, hold out a hand, and touch\r\nthe flesh of the afflicted one. Instantly the spasms cease, the eyes\r\nopen, color returns to the countenance, the limbs resume their position\r\nand functions, and life and intelligence are wholly restored. The\r\nsufferer comes to herself, walks back, and takes her seat as well as\r\never. The effect upon the accused person must have been confounding. It\r\nis a wonder that it did not oftener break them down. It sometimes did.\r\nPoor Deliverance Hobbs, when the[ii.187] process was tried upon her,\r\nwas wholly overcome, and passed from conscious and calmly asserted\r\ninnocence to a helpless abandonment of reason, conscience, and herself,\r\nexclaiming, \"I am amazed! I am amazed!\" and assented afterwards to\r\nevery charge brought against her, and said whatever she was told, or\r\nsupposed they wished her to say.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of May, warrants were issued against Daniel Andrew; George\r\nJacobs, Jr.; his wife, Rebecca Jacobs; Sarah Buckley, wife of William\r\nBuckley; and Mary Whittredge, daughter of said Buckley,—all of Salem\r\nVillage; Elizabeth Hart, wife of Isaac Hart, of Lynn; Thomas Farrar,\r\nSr., also of Lynn; Elizabeth Colson, of Reading; and Bethiah Carter, of\r\nWoburn. There is nothing of special interest among the few papers that\r\nare on file relating to Hart, Colson, or Carter. The constable made\r\nreturn that he had searched the houses of Daniel Andrew and George\r\nJacobs, Jr., but could not find them. He brought in forthwith the\r\nbodies of Sarah Buckley, Mary Whittredge, and Rebecca Jacobs. Farrar\r\nand the rest were brought in shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\nDaniel Andrew was one of the leading men of the village, and the\r\nwarrant against him was proof that soon none would be too high to be\r\nreached by the prosecutors. He felt that it was in vain to attempt to\r\nresist their destructive power; and, getting notice in some way of the\r\napproach of the constable, with his near neighbor, friend, and\r\nconnection, George Jacobs,[ii.188] Jr., effected his escape, and found\r\nrefuge in a foreign country.\r\n\r\nRebecca, the wife of George Jacobs, Jr., was the victim of a partial\r\nderangement. Her daughter Margaret was already in jail. Her husband had\r\nescaped by a hurried flight, and his father was in prison awaiting his\r\ntrial. She was left in a lonely and unprotected condition, in a country\r\nbut thinly settled, in the midst of woods. The constable came with his\r\nwarrant for her. She was driven to desperation, and was inclined to\r\nresist; but he persuaded her to go with him by holding out the\r\ninducement that she would soon be permitted to return. Four young\r\nchildren, one of them an infant, were left in the house; but those who\r\nwere old enough to walk followed after, crying, endeavoring to overtake\r\nher. Some of the neighbors took them into their houses. The\r\nimprisonment of a woman in her situation and mental condition was an\r\noutrage; but she was kept in irons, as they all were, for eight months.\r\nHer mother addressed an humble but earnest and touching petition to the\r\nchief-justice of the court at Salem, setting forth her daughter's\r\ncondition; but it was of no avail. Afterwards, she addressed a similar\r\nmemorial to \"His Excellency Sir William Phips, Knight, Governor, and\r\nthe Honorable Council sitting at Boston,\" in the following terms:—\r\n\r\n\"_The Humble Petition of Rebecca Fox, of Cambridge, showeth_, that,\r\nwhereas Rebecca Jacobs (daughter of your humble petitioner) has, a long\r\ntime,—even many months,—now lain in prison for witchcraft, and is well\r\nknown to be a[ii.189] person crazed, distracted, and broken in mind,\r\nyour humble petitioner does most humbly and earnestly seek unto Your\r\nExcellency and to Your Honors for relief in this case.\r\n\r\n\"Your petitioner,—who knows well the condition of her poor\r\ndaughter,—together with several others of good repute and credit, are\r\nready to offer their oaths, that the said Jacobs is a woman crazed,\r\ndistracted, and broken in her mind; and that she has been so these\r\ntwelve years and upwards.\r\n\r\n\"However, for (I think) above this half-year, the said Jacobs has lain\r\nin prison, and yet remains there, attended with many sore difficulties.\r\n\r\n\"Christianity and nature do each of them oblige your petitioner to be\r\nvery solicitous in this matter; and, although many weighty cases do\r\nexercise your thoughts, yet your petitioner can have no rest in her\r\nmind till such time as she has offered this her address on behalf of\r\nher daughter.\r\n\r\n\"Some have died already in prison, and others have been dangerously\r\nsick; and how soon others, and, among them, my poor child, by the\r\ndifficulties of this confinement may be sick and die, God only knows.\r\n\r\n\"She is uncapable of making that shift for herself that others can do;\r\nand such are her circumstances, on other accounts, that your\r\npetitioner, who is her tender mother, has many great sorrows, and\r\nalmost overcoming burdens, on her mind upon her account; but, in the\r\nmidst of all her perplexities and troubles (next to supplicating to a\r\ngood and merciful God), your petitioner has no way for help but to make\r\nthis her afflicted condition known unto you. So, not doubting but Your\r\nExcellency and Your Honors will readily hear the cries and groans of a\r\npoor distressed woman, and grant what[ii.190] help and enlargement you\r\nmay, your petitioner heartily begs God's gracious presence with you;\r\nand subscribes herself, in all humble manner, your sorrowful and\r\ndistressed petitioner,\r\n\r\nRebecca Fox.\"\r\n\r\nNo heed was paid to this petition; and the unfortunate woman remained\r\nin jail until—after the delusion had passed from the minds of the\r\npeople—a grand jury found a bill against her, on which she was brought\r\nto trial, Jan. 3, 1693, and acquitted. There is no more disgraceful\r\nfeature in all the proceedings than the long imprisonment of this\r\nwoman, her being brought to trial, and the obdurate deafness to\r\nhumanity and reason of the chief-justice, the governor, and the\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nNo papers are found relating to the examination of Thomas Farrar; but\r\nthe following deposition shows the manner in which prosecutions were\r\ngot up:—\r\n\r\n\"The Deposition of Ann Putnam, who testifieth and saith, that, on the\r\n8th of May, 1692, there appeared to me the apparition of an old,\r\ngray-headed man, with a great nose, which tortured me, and almost\r\nchoked me, and urged me to write in his book; and I asked him what was\r\nhis name, and from whence he came, for I would complain of him; and he\r\ntold me he came from Lynn, and people do call him 'old Father Pharaoh;'\r\nand he said he was my grandfather, for my father used to call him\r\nfather: but I told him I would not call him grandfather; for he was a\r\nwizard, and I would complain of him. And, ever since, he hath afflicted\r\nme by times, beating me and pinching me and almost choking me, and\r\nurging me continually to write in his book.\"[ii.191]\r\n\r\n\"We, whose names are underwritten, having been conversant with Ann\r\nPutnam, have heard her declare what is above written,—what she said she\r\nsaw and heard from the apparition of old Pharaoh,—and also have seen\r\nher tortures, and perceived her hellish temptations, by her loud\r\noutcries, 'I will not write, old Pharaoh,—I will not write in your\r\nbook.'\r\n\r\nThomas Putnam,\r\nRobert Morrell.\"\r\n\r\nShe had heard this person spoken of as \"old Father Pharaoh,\" with his\r\n\"great nose;\" and, from a mere spirit of mischief,—for the fun of the\r\nthing,—cried out upon him. Many of the documents exhibit a levity of\r\nspirit among these girls, which show how hardened and reckless they had\r\nbecome. The following depositions are illustrative of this state of\r\nmind among them:—\r\n\r\n\"The Deposition of Clement Coldum, aged sixty years, or\r\nthereabout.—Saith that, on the 29th of May, 1692, being at Salem\r\nVillage, carrying home Elizabeth Hubbard from the meeting behind me,\r\nshe desired me to ride faster. I asked her why. She said the woods were\r\nfull of devils, and said, 'There!' and 'There they be!' but I could see\r\nnone. Then I put on my horse; and, after I had ridden a while, she told\r\nme I might ride softer, for we had outridden them. I asked her if she\r\nwas not afraid of the Devil. She answered me, 'No: she could discourse\r\nwith the Devil as well as with me,' and further saith not. This I am\r\nready to testify on oath, if called thereto, as witness my hand.\r\n\r\n\"Clement Coldum.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Testimony of Daniel Elliot, aged twenty-seven years or\r\nthereabouts, who testifieth and saith, that I, being[ii.192] at the\r\nhouse of Lieutenant Ingersoll, on the 28th of March, in the year 1692,\r\nthere being present one of the afflicted persons, who cried out and\r\nsaid, 'There's Goody Procter.' William Raymond, Jr., being there\r\npresent, told the girl he believed she lied, for he saw nothing. Then\r\nGoody Ingersoll told the girl she told a lie, for there was nothing.\r\nThen the girl said she did it for sport,—they must have some sport.\"\r\n\r\nSarah Buckley was examined May 18, and her daughter Mary Whittredge\r\nprobably on the same day. We have Parris's report of the proceedings in\r\nreference to the former. The only witnesses against her were the\r\nafflicted children. They performed their grand operation of going into\r\nfits, and being carried to the accused and subjected to her touch; Ann\r\nPutnam, Susanna Sheldon, and Mary Warren enacting the part in\r\nsuccession. Sheldon cried out, \"There is the black man whispering in\r\nher ear!\" The magistrates and all beholders were convinced. She was\r\ncommitted to prison, and remained in irons for eight months before a\r\ntrial, which resulted in her acquittal. So eminently excellent was the\r\ncharacter of Goodwife Buckley, that her arrest and imprisonment led to\r\nexpressions in her favor as honorable to those who had the courage to\r\nutter them as to her. The following certificates were given, previous\r\nto her trial, by ministers in the neighborhood:—\r\n\r\n\"These are to certify whom it may or shall concern, that I have known\r\nSarah, the wife of William Buckley, of Salem Village, more or less,\r\never since she was brought out of[ii.193] England, which is above fifty\r\nyears ago; and, during all that time, I never knew nor heard of any\r\nevil in her carriage, or conversation unbecoming a Christian: likewise,\r\nshe was bred up by Christian parents all the time she lived here at\r\nIpswich. I further testify, that the said Sarah was admitted as a\r\nmember into the church of Ipswich above forty years since; and that I\r\nnever heard from others, or observed by myself, any thing of her that\r\nwas inconsistent with her profession or unsuitable to Christianity,\r\neither in word, deed, or conversation, and am strangely surprised that\r\nany person should speak or think of her as one worthy to be suspected\r\nof any such crime that she is now charged with. In testimony hereof I\r\nhave here set my hand this 20th of June, 1692.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hubbard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Being desired by Goodman Buckley to give my testimony to his wife's\r\nconversation before this great calamity befell her, I cannot refuse to\r\nbear witness to the truth; viz., that, during the time of her living in\r\nSalem for many years in communion with this church, having occasionally\r\nfrequent converse and discourse with her, I have never observed myself,\r\nnor heard from any other, any thing that was unsuitable to a\r\nconversation becoming the gospel, and have always looked upon her as a\r\nserious, Godly woman.\r\n\r\n\"John Higginson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Marblehead, Jan. 2, 1692/3.—Upon the same request, having had the like\r\nopportunity by her residence many years at Marblehead, I can do no less\r\nthan give the alike testimony for her pious conversation during her\r\nabode in this place and communion with us.\r\n\r\nSamuel Cheever.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Hubbard was the venerable minister of Ipswich, described by\r\nHutchinson as \"a man of learning,[ii.194] and of a candid and\r\nbenevolent mind, accompanied with a good degree of catholicism.\" He is\r\ndescribed by another writer as \"a man of singular modesty, learned\r\nwithout ostentation.\" He will be remembered with honor for his long and\r\ndevoted service in the Christian ministry, and as the historian of New\r\nEngland and of the Indian wars.\r\n\r\nJohn Higginson was worthy of the title of the \"Nestor of the\r\nNew-England clergy.\" He was at this time seventy-six years old, and had\r\nbeen a preacher of the gospel fifty-five years. For thirty-three years\r\nhe had been pastor of the First Church in Salem, of which his father\r\nwas the first preacher. No character, in all our annals, shines with a\r\npurer lustre. John Dunton visited him in 1686, and thus speaks of him:\r\n\"All men look to him as a common father; and old age, for his sake, is\r\na reverend thing. He is eminent for all the graces that adorn a\r\nminister. His very presence puts vice out of countenance; his\r\nconversation is a glimpse of heaven.\" The fact, that, while his\r\ncolleague, Nicholas Noyes, took so active and disastrous a part in the\r\nprosecutions, he, at an early stage, discountenanced them, shows that\r\nhe was a person of discrimination and integrity. That he did not\r\nconceal his disapprobation of the proceedings is demonstrated, not only\r\nby the tenor of his attestation in behalf of Goodwife Buckley, but by\r\nthe decisive circumstance that the \"afflicted children\" cried out\r\nagainst his daughter Anna, the wife of Captain William Dolliver, of\r\nGloucester; got a warrant to apprehend her; and[ii.195] had her brought\r\nto the Salem jail, and committed as a witch. They never struck at\r\nfriends, but were sure to punish all who were suspected to disapprove\r\nof the proceedings. How long Mrs. Dolliver remained in prison we are\r\nnot informed. But it was impossible to break down the influence or\r\nindependence of Mr. Higginson. It is not improbable that he believed in\r\nwitchcraft, with all the other divines of his day; but he feared not to\r\nbear testimony to personal worth, and could not be brought to\r\nco-operate in violence, or fall in with the spirit of persecution. The\r\nweight of his character compelled the deference of the most heated\r\nzealots, and even Cotton Mather himself was eager to pay him homage.\r\nFour years afterwards, he thus writes of him: \"This good old man is yet\r\nalive; and he that, from a child, knew the Holy Scriptures, does, at\r\nthose years wherein men use to be twice children, continue preaching\r\nthem with such a manly, pertinent, and judicious vigor, and with so\r\nlittle decay of his intellectual abilities, as is indeed a matter of\r\njust admiration.\"\r\n\r\nSamuel Cheever was a clergyman of the highest standing, and held in\r\nuniversal esteem through a long life.\r\n\r\nFrom passages incidentally given, it has appeared that it was quite\r\ncommon, in those times, to attribute accidents, injuries, pains, and\r\ndiseases of all kinds, to an \"evil hand.\" It was not confined to this\r\nlocality. When, however, the public mind had become excited to so\r\nextraordinary a degree by circumstances con[ii.196]nected with the\r\nprosecutions in 1692, this tendency of the popular credulity was very\r\nmuch strengthened. Believing that the sufferer or patient was the\r\nvictim of the malignity of Satan, and it also being a doctrine of the\r\nestablished belief that he could not act upon human beings or affairs\r\nexcept through the instrumental agency of some other human beings in\r\nconfederacy with him, the question naturally arose, in every specific\r\ninstance, Who is the person in this diabolical league, and doing the\r\nwill of the Devil in this case? Who is the witch? It may well be\r\nsupposed, that the suffering person, and all surrounding friends, would\r\nbe most earnest and anxious in pressing this question and seeking its\r\nsolution. The accusing girls at the village were thought to possess the\r\npower to answer it. This gave them great importance, gratified their\r\nvanity and pride, and exalted them to the character of prophetesses.\r\nThey were ready to meet the calls made upon them in this capacity;\r\nwould be carried to the room of a sick person; and, on entering it,\r\nwould exclaim, on the first return of pain, or difficulty of\r\nrespiration, or restless motion of the patient, \"There she is!\" There\r\nis such a one's appearance, choking or otherwise tormenting him or her.\r\nIf the minds of the accusing girls had been led towards a new victim,\r\nhis or her name would be used, and a warrant issued for his\r\napprehension. If not, then the name of some one already in confinement\r\nwould be used on the occasion. It was also a received opinion, that,\r\nwhile ordinary fastenings would not prevent a[ii.197] witch from going\r\nabroad, \"in her apparition,\" to any distance to afflict persons, a\r\nredoubling of them might. Whenever one of the accusing girls pretended\r\nto see the spectres of persons already in jail afflicting any one,\r\norders would forthwith be given to have them more heavily chained.\r\nEvery once in a while, a wretched prisoner, already suffering from\r\nbonds and handcuffs, would be subjected to additional manacles and\r\nchains. This was one of the most cruel features in these proceedings.\r\nIt is illustrated by the following document:—\r\n\r\n\"The Deposition of Benjamin Hutchinson, who testifieth and saith, that\r\nmy wife was much afflicted, presently after the last execution, with\r\nviolent pains in her head and teeth, and all parts of her body; but, on\r\nsabbath day was fortnight in the morning, she being in such excessive\r\nmisery that she said she believed that she had an evil hand upon her:\r\nwhereupon I went to Mary Walcot, one of our next neighbors, to come and\r\nlook to see if she could see anybody upon her; and, as soon as she came\r\ninto the house, she said that our two next neighbors, Sarah Buckley and\r\nMary Whittredge, were upon my wife. And immediately my wife had ease,\r\nand Mary Walcot was tormented. Whereupon I went down to the sheriff,\r\nand desired him to take some course with those women, that they might\r\nnot have such power to torment: and presently he ordered them to be\r\nfettered, and, ever since that, my wife has been tolerable well; and I\r\nbelieve, in my heart, that Sarah Buckley and Mary Whittredge have hurt\r\nmy wife and several others by acts of witchcraft.\r\n\r\n\"Benjamin Hutchinson owned the above-written evi[ii.198]dence to be the\r\ntruth, upon oath, before the grand inquest, 15-7, 1692.\"\r\n\r\nThe evidence is quite conclusive, from considerations suggested by the\r\nforegoing document, and indications scattered through the papers\r\ngenerally, that all persons committed on the charge of witchcraft were\r\nkept heavily ironed, and otherwise strongly fastened. Only a few of the\r\nbills of expenses incurred are preserved. Among them we find the\r\nfollowing: For mending and putting on Rachel Clenton's fetters; one\r\npair of fetters for John Howard; a pair of fetters each for John\r\nJackson, Sr., and John Jackson, Jr.; eighteen pounds of iron for\r\nfetters; for making four pair of iron fetters and two pair of\r\nhandcuffs, and putting them on the legs and hands of Goodwife Cloyse,\r\nEasty, Bromidg, and Green; chains for Sarah Good and Sarah Osburn;\r\nshackles for ten prisoners; and one pair of irons for Mary Cox. When we\r\nreflect upon the character of the prisoners generally,—many of them\r\ndelicate and infirm, several venerable for their virtues as well as\r\nyears,—and that they were kept in this cruelly painful condition from\r\nearly spring to the middle of the next January, and the larger part to\r\nthe May of 1693, in the extremes of heat and cold, exposed to the most\r\ndistressing severities of both, crowded in narrow, dark, and noisome\r\njails under an accumulation of all their discomforts, restraints,\r\nprivations, exposures, and abominations, our wonder is, not that many\r\nof them died, but that all did not break down in body and mind.[ii.199]\r\n\r\nSarah Buckley and her daughter were not brought to trial until after\r\nthe power of the prosecution to pursue to the death had ceased. They\r\nwere acquitted in January, 1692. Their goods and chattels had all been\r\nseized by the officers, as was the usual practice, at the time of their\r\narrest. In humble circumstances before, it took their last shilling to\r\nmeet the charges of their imprisonment. They, as all others, were\r\nrequired to provide their own maintenance while in prison; and, after\r\ntrial and acquittal, were not discharged until all costs were paid.\r\nFive pounds had to be raised, to satisfy the claims of the officers of\r\nthe court and of the jails, for each of them. The result was, the\r\nfamily was utterly impoverished. The poor old woman, with her aged\r\nhusband, suffered much, there is reason to fear, from absolute want\r\nduring all the rest of their days. Their truly Christian virtues\r\ndignified their poverty, and secured the respect and esteem of all good\r\nmen. The Rev. Joseph Green has this entry in his diary: \"Jan. 2,\r\n1702.—Old William Buckley died this evening. He was at meeting the last\r\nsabbath, and died with the cold, I fear, for want of comforts and good\r\ntending. Lord forgive! He was about eighty years old. I visited him and\r\nprayed with him on Monday, and also the evening before he died. He was\r\nvery poor; but, I hope, had not his portion in this life.\" The\r\nejaculation, \"Lord forgive!\" expresses the deep sense Mr. Green had, of\r\nwhich his whole ministry gave evidence, of the inexpressible sufferings\r\nand wrongs brought upon families[ii.200] by the witchcraft\r\nprosecutions. The case of Sarah Buckley, her husband and family, was\r\nbut one of many. The humble, harmless, innocent people who experienced\r\nthat fearful and pitiless persecution had to drink of as bitter a cup\r\nas ever was permitted by an inscrutable Providence to be presented to\r\nhuman lips. In reference to them, we feel as an assurance, what good\r\nMr. Green humbly hoped, that \"they had not their portion in this life.\"\r\nThose who went firmly, patiently, and calmly through that great trial\r\nwithout losing love or faith, are crowned with glory and honor.\r\n\r\nThe examination and commitment of Mary Easty, on the 21st of April,\r\nhave already been described. For some reason, and in a way of which we\r\nhave no information, she was discharged from prison on the 18th of May,\r\nand wholly released. This seems to have been very distasteful to the\r\naccusing girls. They were determined not to let it rest so; and put\r\ninto operation their utmost energies to get her back to imprisonment.\r\nOn the 20th of May, Mercy Lewis, being then at the house of John\r\nPutnam, Jr., was taken with fits, and experienced tortures of\r\nunprecedented severity. The particular circumstances on this occasion,\r\nas gathered from various depositions, illustrate very strikingly the\r\nskilful manner in which the girls managed to produce the desired effect\r\nupon the public mind.\r\n\r\nSamuel Abbey, a neighbor, whether sent for or not we are not informed,\r\nwent to John Putnam's house that morning, about nine o'clock. He found\r\nMercy in[ii.201] a terrible condition, crying out with piteous tones of\r\nanguish, \"Dear Lord, receive my soul.\"—\"Lord, let them not kill me\r\nquite.\"—\"Pray for the salvation of my soul, for they will kill me\r\noutright.\" He was desired to go to Thomas Putnam's house to bring his\r\ndaughter Ann, \"to see if she could see who it was that hurt Mercy\r\nLewis.\" He found Abigail Williams with Ann, and they accompanied him\r\nback to John Putnam's. On the way, they both cried out that they saw\r\nthe apparition of Goody Easty afflicting Mercy Lewis. When they reached\r\nthe scene, they exclaimed, \"There is Goody Easty and John Willard and\r\nMary Whittredge afflicting the body of Mercy Lewis;\" Mercy at the time\r\nlaboring for breath, and appearing as choked and strangled, convulsed,\r\nand apparently at the last gasp. \"Thus,\" says Abbey, \"she continued the\r\ngreatest part of the day, in such tortures as no tongue can express.\"\r\nMary Walcot was sent for. Upon coming in, she cried out, \"There is the\r\napparition of Goody Easty choking Mercy Lewis, pressing upon her\r\nbreasts with both her hands, and putting a chain about her neck.\" A\r\nmessage was then despatched for Elizabeth Hubbard. She, too, saw the\r\nshape of Goody Easty, \"the very same woman that was sent home the other\r\nday,\" aided in her diabolical operations by Willard and Whittredge,\r\n\"torturing Mercy in a most dreadful manner.\" Intelligence of the\r\nshocking sufferings of Mercy was circulated far and wide, and people\r\nhurried to the spot from all directions. Jonathan Putnam, James\r\nDarling, Benja[ii.202]min Hutchinson, and Samuel Braybrook reached the\r\nhouse during the evening, and found Mercy \"in a case as if death would\r\nhave quickly followed.\" Occasionally, Mercy would have a respite; and,\r\nat such intervals, Elizabeth Hubbard would fill the gap. \"These two\r\nfell into fits by turns; the one being well while the other was ill.\"\r\nEach of them continued, all the while, crying out against Goody Easty,\r\nuttering in their trances vehement remonstrances against her cruel\r\noperations, representing her as bringing their winding-sheets and\r\ncoffins, and threatening to kill them \"if they would not sign to her\r\nbook.\" Their acting was so complete that the bystanders seem to have\r\nthought that they heard the words of Easty, as well as the responses of\r\nthe girls; and that they saw the \"winding-sheet, coffin,\" and \"the\r\nbook.\" In the general consternation, Marshal Herrick was sent for. What\r\nhe saw, heard, thought, and did, appears from the following:—\r\n\r\n\"May 20, 1692.—The Testimony of George Herrick, aged thirty-four or\r\nthereabouts, and John Putnam, Jr., of Salem Village, aged thirty-five\r\nyears or thereabouts.—Testifieth and saith, that, being at the house of\r\nthe above-said John Putnam, both saw Mercy Lewis in a very dreadful and\r\nsolemn condition, so that to our apprehension she could not continue\r\nlong in this world without a mitigation of those torments we saw her\r\nin, which caused us to expedite a hasty despatch to apprehend Mary\r\nEasty, in hopes, if possible, it might save her life; and, returning\r\nthe same night to said John Putnam's house about midnight,[ii.203] we\r\nfound the said Mercy Lewis in a dreadful fit, but her reason was then\r\nreturned. Again she said, 'What! have you brought me the winding-sheet,\r\nGoodwife Easty? Well, I had rather go into the winding-sheet than set\r\nmy hand to the book;' but, after that, her fits were weaker and weaker,\r\nbut still complaining that she was very sick of her stomach. About\r\nbreak of day, she fell asleep, but still continues extremely sick, and\r\nwas taken with a dreadful fit just as we left her; so that we perceived\r\nlife in her, and that was all.\"\r\n\r\nEdward Putnam, after stating that the grievous afflictions and tortures\r\nof Mercy Lewis were charged, by her and the other four girls, upon Mary\r\nEasty, deposes as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"I myself, being there present with several others, looked for nothing\r\nelse but present death for almost the space of two days and a night.\r\nShe was choked almost to death, insomuch we thought sometimes she had\r\nbeen dead; her mouth and teeth shut; and all this very often until such\r\ntime as we understood Mary Easty was laid in irons.\"\r\n\r\nMercy's fits did not cease immediately upon Easty's being apprehended,\r\nbut on her being committed to prison and chains by the magistrate in\r\nSalem.\r\n\r\nAn examination of distances, with the map before us, will show the\r\nrapidity with which business was despatched on this occasion. Abbey\r\nwent to John Putnam, Jr.'s house at nine o'clock in the morning of May\r\n20. He was sent to Thomas Putnam's house for Ann, and brought her and\r\nAbigail Williams back with him. Mary Walcot was sent for to the house\r\nof her father, Captain Jonathan Walcot, and went up at one[ii.204]\r\no'clock, \"about an hour by sun.\" Then Elizabeth Hubbard, who lived at\r\nthe house of Dr. Griggs, \"was carried up to Constable John Putnam's\r\nhouse:\" Jonathan Putnam, James Darling, Benjamin Hutchinson, and Samuel\r\nBraybrook got there in the evening, as they say, \"between eight and\r\neleven o'clock.\" In the mean time, Marshal Herrick had arrived. Steps\r\nwere taken to get out a warrant. John Putnam and Benjamin Hutchinson\r\nwent to Salem to Hathorne for the purpose. They must have started soon\r\nafter eight. Hathorne issued the warrant forthwith. It is dated May 20.\r\nHerrick went with it to the house of Isaac Easty, made the arrest, sent\r\nhis prisoner to the jail in Salem, and returned himself to John\r\nPutnam's house \"about midnight;\" staid to witness the apparently mortal\r\nsufferings of Mercy until \"about break of day;\" returned to Salem; had\r\nthe examination before Hathorne, at Thomas Beadle's: the whole thing\r\nwas finished, Mary Easty in irons, information of the result carried to\r\nJohn Putnam's, and Mercy's agonies ceased that afternoon, as Edward\r\nPutnam testifies.\r\n\r\nI have given this particular account of the circumstances that led to\r\nand attended Mary Easty's second arrest, because the papers belonging\r\nto the case afford, in some respects, a better insight of the state of\r\nthings than others, and because they enable us to realize the power\r\nwhich the accusing girls exercised. The continuance of their\r\nconvulsions and spasms for such a length of time, the large number of\r\npersons who witnessed and watched them in the broad daylight,\r\nand[ii.205] the perfect success of their operations, show how\r\nthoroughly they had become trained in their arts. I have presented the\r\noccurrences in the order of time, so that, by estimating the distances\r\ntraversed and the period within which they took place, an idea can be\r\nformed of the vehement earnestness with which men acted in the\r\n\"hurrying distractions of amazing afflictions\" and overwhelming\r\nterrors. This instance also gives us a view of the horrible state of\r\nthings, when any one, however respectable and worthy, was liable, at\r\nany moment, to be seized, maligned, and destroyed.\r\n\r\nMary Easty had previously experienced the malice of the persecutors.\r\nFor two months she had suffered the miseries of imprisonment, had just\r\nbeen released, and for two days enjoyed the restoration of liberty, the\r\ncomforts of her home, and a re-union with her family. She and they, no\r\ndoubt, considered themselves safe from any further outrage. After\r\nmidnight, she was roused from sleep by the unfeeling marshal, torn from\r\nher husband and children, carried back to prison, loaded with chains,\r\nand finally consigned to a dreadful and most cruel death. She was an\r\nexcellent and pious matron. Her husband, referring to the transaction\r\nnearly twenty years afterwards, justly expressed what all must feel,\r\nthat it was \"a hellish molestation.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most malignant witnesses against Mary Easty was \"Goodwife\r\nBibber.\" She obtruded herself in many of the cases, acting as a sort of\r\noutside member of the \"accusing circle,\" volunteering her aid\r\nin[ii.206] carrying on the persecutions. It was an outrage for the\r\nmagistrates or judges to have countenanced such a false defamer. There\r\nare, among the papers, documents which show that she ought to have been\r\npunished as a calumniator, rather than be called to utter, under oath,\r\nlies against respectable people. The following deposition was sworn to\r\nin Court:—\r\n\r\n\"The Testimony of Joseph Fowler, who testifieth that Goodman Bibber and\r\nhis wife lived at my house; and I did observe and take notice that\r\nGoodwife Bibber was a woman who was very idle in her calling, and very\r\nmuch given to tattling and tale-bearing, making mischief amongst her\r\nneighbors, and very much given to speak bad words, and would call her\r\nhusband bad names, and was a woman of a very turbulent, unruly spirit.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph Fowler lived in Wenham, and was a person of respectability and\r\ninfluence. His brother Philip was also a leading man; was employed as\r\nattorney by the Village Parish in its lawsuit with Mr. Parris; and\r\nmarried a sister of Joseph Herrick. They were the grandsons of the\r\nfirst Philip, who was an early emigrant from Wales, settling in\r\nIpswich, where he had large landed estates. Henry Fowler and his two\r\nbrothers, now of Danvers, are the descendants of this family: one of\r\nthem, Augustus, distinguished as a naturalist, especially in the\r\ndepartment of ornithology; the other, Samuel Page Fowler, as an\r\nexplorer of our early annals and local antiquities. In 1692, one of the\r\nFowlers conducted the proceedings in Court[ii.207] against the head and\r\nfront of the witchcraft prosecution; and the other had the courage, in\r\nthe most fearful hour of the delusion, to give open testimony in the\r\ndefence of its victims. It is an interesting circumstance, that one of\r\nthe same name and descent, in his reprint of the papers of Calef and in\r\nother publications, has done as much as any other person of our day to\r\nbring that whole transaction under the light of truth and justice.\r\n\r\nJohn Porter, who was a grandson of the original John Porter and the\r\noriginal William Dodge and a man of property and family, with his wife\r\nLydia; Thomas Jacobs and Mary his wife; and Richard Walker,—all of\r\nWenham, and for a long time neighbors of this Bibber,—testify, in\r\ncorroboration of the statement of Fowler, that she was a woman of an\r\nunruly, turbulent spirit, double-tongued, much given to tattling and\r\ntale-bearing, making mischief amongst her neighbors, very much given to\r\nspeak bad words, often speaking against one and another, telling lies\r\nand uttering malicious wishes against people. It was abundantly proved\r\nthat she had long been known to be able to fall into fits at any time.\r\nOne witness said \"she would often fall into strange fits when she was\r\ncrossed of her humor;\" and another, \"that she could fall into fits as\r\noften as she pleased.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of May, warrants were issued against the wife of William\r\nBasset, of Lynn; Susanna Roots, of Beverly; and Sarah, daughter of John\r\nProcter of Salem Farms; a few days after, against Benjamin, a son\r\nof[ii.208] said John Procter; Mary Derich, wife of Michael Derich, and\r\ndaughter of William Basset of Lynn; and the wife of Robert Pease of\r\nSalem. Such papers as relate to these persons vary in no particular\r\nworthy of notice from those already presented.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of May, warrants were issued against Martha Carrier, of\r\nAndover; Elizabeth Fosdick, of Malden; Wilmot Read, of Marblehead;\r\nSarah Rice, of Reading; Elizabeth How, of Topsfield; Captain John\r\nAlden, of Boston; William Procter, of Salem Farms; Captain John Flood,\r\nof Rumney Marsh; —— Toothaker and her daughter, of Billerica; and ----\r\nAbbot, between Topsfield and Wenham line. On the 30th, a warrant was\r\nissued against Elizabeth, wife of Stephen Paine, of Charlestown; on the\r\n4th of June, against Mary, wife of Benjamin Ireson, of Lynn. Besides\r\nthese, there are notices of complaints made and warrants issued against\r\na great number of people in all parts of the country: Mary Bradbury, of\r\nSalisbury; Lydia and Sarah Dustin, of Reading; Ann Sears, of Woburn;\r\nJob Tookey, of Beverly; Abigail Somes, of Gloucester; Elizabeth Carey,\r\nof Charlestown; Candy, a negro woman; and many others. Some of them\r\nhave points of interest, demanding particular notice.\r\n\r\nThe case of Martha Carrier has some remarkable features. It has been\r\nshown, by passages already adduced, that every idle rumor; every thing\r\nthat the gossip of the credulous or the fertile imaginations of the\r\nmalignant could produce; every thing, gleaned from the memory or the\r\nfancy, that could have an unfavora[ii.209]ble bearing upon an accused\r\nperson, however foreign or irrelevant it might be to the charge, was\r\nallowed to be brought in evidence before the magistrates, and received\r\nat the trials. We have seen that a child under five years of age was\r\narrested, and put into prison. Children were not only permitted, but\r\ninduced, to become witnesses against their parents, and parents against\r\ntheir children. Husbands and wives were made to criminate each other as\r\nwitnesses in court. When Martha Carrier was arrested, four of her\r\nchildren were also taken into custody. An indictment against one of\r\nthem is among the papers. Under the terrors brought to bear upon them,\r\nthey were prevailed on to be confessors. The following shows how these\r\nchildren were trained to tell their story:—\r\n\r\n\"It was asked Sarah Carrier by the magistrates,—\r\n\r\n\"How long hast thou been a witch?—Ever since I was six years old.\r\n\r\n\"How old are you now?—Near eight years old: brother Richard says I\r\nshall be eight years old in November next.\r\n\r\n\"Who made you a witch?—My mother: she made me set my hand to a book.\r\n\r\n\"How did you set your hand to it?—I touched it with my fingers, and the\r\nbook was red: the paper of it was white.\r\n\r\n\"She said she never had seen the black man: the place where she did it\r\nwas in Andrew Foster's pasture, and Elizabeth Johnson, Jr., was there.\r\nBeing asked who was there besides, she answered, her aunt Toothaker and\r\nher cousin.[ii.210] Being asked when it was, she said, when she was\r\nbaptized.\r\n\r\n\"What did they promise to give you?—A black dog.\r\n\r\n\"Did the dog ever come to you?—No.\r\n\r\n\"But you said you saw a cat once: what did that say to you?—It said it\r\nwould tear me in pieces, if I would not set my hand to the book.\r\n\r\n\"She said her mother baptized her, and the Devil, or black man, was not\r\nthere, as she saw; and her mother said, when she baptized her, 'Thou\r\nart mine for ever and ever. Amen.'\r\n\r\n\"How did you afflict folks?—I pinched them.\r\n\r\n\"And she said she had no puppets, but she went to them that she\r\nafflicted. Being asked whether she went in her body or her spirit, she\r\nsaid in her spirit. She said her mother carried her thither to afflict.\r\n\r\n\"How did your mother carry you when she was in prison?—She came like a\r\nblack cat.\r\n\r\n\"How did you know it was your mother?—The cat told me so, that she was\r\nmy mother. She said she afflicted Phelps's child last Saturday, and\r\nElizabeth Johnson joined with her to do it. She had a wooden spear,\r\nabout as long as her finger, of Elizabeth Johnson; and she had it of\r\nthe Devil. She would not own that she had ever been at the\r\nwitch-meeting at the village. This is the substance.\r\n\r\n\"Simon Willard.\"\r\n\r\nThe confession of another of her children is among the papers. It runs\r\nthus:—\r\n\r\n\"Have you been in the Devil's snare?—Yes.\r\n\r\n\"Is your brother Andrew ensnared by the Devil's snare?—Yes.[ii.211]\r\n\r\n\"How long has your brother been a witch?—Near a month.\r\n\r\n\"How long have you been a witch?—Not long.\r\n\r\n\"Have you joined in afflicting the afflicted persons?—Yes.\r\n\r\n\"You helped to hurt Timothy Swan, did you?—Yes.\r\n\r\n\"How long have you been a witch?—About five weeks.\r\n\r\n\"Who was in company when you covenanted with the Devil?—Mrs. Bradbury.\r\n\r\n\"Did she help you afflict?—Yes.\r\n\r\n\"Who was at the village meeting when you were there?—Goodwife How,\r\nGoodwife Nurse, Goodwife Wildes, Procter and his wife, Mrs. Bradbury,\r\nand Corey's wife.\r\n\r\n\"What did they do there?—Eat, and drank wine.\r\n\r\n\"Was there a minister there?—No, not as I know of.\r\n\r\n\"From whence had you your wine?—From Salem, I think, it was.\r\n\r\n\"Goodwife Oliver there?—Yes: I knew her.\"\r\n\r\nIn concluding his report of the trial of this wretched woman, whose\r\nchildren were thus made to become the instruments for procuring her\r\ndeath, Dr. Cotton Mather expresses himself in the following language:—\r\n\r\n\"This rampant hag (Martha Carrier) was the person of whom the\r\nconfessions of the witches, and of her own children among the rest,\r\nagreed that the Devil had promised her that she should be queen of\r\nHell.\"\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident that this \"rampant hag\" had no better opinion of\r\nthe dignitaries and divines who managed matters at the time than they\r\nhad of her.[ii.212] The record of her examination shows that she was\r\nnot afraid to speak her mind, and in plain terms too. When brought\r\nbefore the magistrates, the following were their questions and her\r\nanswers. The accusing witnesses having severally made their charges\r\nagainst her, declaring that she had tormented them in various ways, and\r\nthreatened to cut their throats if they would not sign the Devil's\r\nbook, which, they said, she had presented to them, the magistrates\r\naddressed her in these words: \"What do you say to this you are charged\r\nwith?\" She answered, \"I have not done it.\" One of the accusers cried\r\nout that she was, at that moment, sticking pins into her. Another\r\ndeclared that she was then looking upon \"the black man,\"—the shape in\r\nwhich they pretended the Devil appeared. The magistrate asked the\r\naccused, \"What black man is that?\" Her answer was, \"I know none.\" The\r\naccusers cried out that the black man was present, and visible to them.\r\nThe magistrate asked her, \"What black man did you see?\" Her answer was,\r\n\"I saw no black man but your own presence.\" Whenever she looked upon\r\nthe accusers, they were knocked down. The magistrate, entirely deluded\r\nby their practised acting, said to her, \"Can you look upon these, and\r\nnot knock them down?\" Her answer was, \"They will dissemble, if I look\r\nupon them.\" He continued: \"You see, you look upon them, and they fall\r\ndown.\" She broke out, \"It is false: the Devil is a liar. I looked upon\r\nnone since I came into the room but you.\" Susanna Sheldon cried out, in\r\na trance, \"I wonder what could[ii.213] you murder thirteen persons\r\nfor.\" At this, her spirit became aroused: the accusers fell into the\r\nmost intolerable outcries and agonies. The accused rebuked the\r\nmagistrate, charging him with unfairness in not paying any regard to\r\nwhat she said, and receiving every thing that the accusers said. \"It is\r\na shameful thing, that you should mind these folks that are out of\r\ntheir wits;\" and, turning to those who were bringing these false and\r\nridiculous charges against her, she said, \"You lie: I am wronged.\" The\r\nenergy and courage of the prisoner threw the accusers, magistrates, and\r\nthe whole crowd into confusion and uproar. The record closes the\r\ndescription of the scene in these words: \"The tortures of the afflicted\r\nwere so great that there was no enduring of it, so that she was ordered\r\naway, and to be bound hand and foot with all expedition; the afflicted,\r\nin the mean while, almost killed, to the great trouble of all\r\nspectators, magistrates, and others.\"\r\n\r\nParris closes his report of this examination as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"Note.—As soon as she was well bound, they all had strange and sudden\r\nease. Mary Walcot told the magistrates that this woman told her she had\r\nbeen a witch this forty years.\"\r\n\r\nThis shows the sort of communications the girls were allowed to hold\r\nwith the magistrates, exciting their prejudices against accused\r\npersons, and filling their ears with all sorts of exaggerated and false\r\nstories. However much she may have been maligned[ii.214] by her\r\nneighbors, some of whom had long been in the habit of circulating\r\nslanders against her, the whole tenor of the papers relating to her\r\nshows that she always indignantly repelled the charge of being a witch,\r\nand was the last person in the world to have volunteered such a\r\nstatement as Mary Walcot reported.\r\n\r\nThe examination of Martha Carrier must have been one of the most\r\nstriking scenes of the whole drama of the witchcraft proceedings. The\r\nvillage meeting-house presented a truly wild and exciting spectacle.\r\nThe fearful and horrible superstition which darkened the minds of the\r\npeople was displayed in their aspect and movements. Their belief, that,\r\nthen and there, they were witnessing the great struggle between the\r\nkingdoms of God and of the Evil One, and that every thing was at stake\r\non the issue, gave an awe-struck intensity to their expression. The\r\nblind, unquestioning confidence of the magistrates, clergy, and all\r\nconcerned in the prosecutions, in the evidence of the accusers; the\r\nloud outcries of their pretended sufferings; their contortions,\r\nswoonings, and tumblings, excited the usual consternation in the\r\nassembly. In addition to this, there was the more than ordinary bold\r\nand defiant bearing of the prisoner, stung to desperation by the\r\noutrage upon human nature in the abuse practised upon her poor\r\nchildren; her firm and unshrinking courage, facing the tempest that was\r\nraised to overwhelm her, sternly rebuking the magistrates,—\"It is a\r\nshameful thing that you should mind these folks[ii.215] that are out of\r\ntheir wits;\"—her whole demeanor, proclaiming her conscious innocence,\r\nand proving that she chose chains, the dungeon, and the scaffold,\r\nrather than to belie herself. Seldom has a scene in real life, or a\r\npicture wrought by the inspiration of genius and the hand of art, in\r\nits individual characters or its general grouping, surpassed that\r\npresented on this occasion.\r\n\r\nHutchinson has preserved the record of another examination of a\r\ndifferent character. An ignorant negro slave-woman was brought before\r\nthe magistrates. She was cunning enough, not only to confess, but to\r\ncover herself with the cloak of having been led into the difficulty by\r\nher mistress.\r\n\r\n\"Candy, are you a witch?—Candy no witch in her country. Candy's mother\r\nno witch. Candy no witch, Barbados. This country, mistress give Candy\r\nwitch.\r\n\r\n\"Did your mistress make you a witch in this country?—Yes: in this\r\ncountry, mistress give Candy witch.\r\n\r\n\"What did your mistress do to make you witch?—Mistress bring book and\r\npen and ink; make Candy write in it.\"\r\n\r\nUpon being asked what she wrote, she took a pen and ink, and made a\r\nmark. Upon being asked how she afflicted people, and where were the\r\npuppets she did it with, she said, that, if they would let her go out\r\nfor a moment, she would show them how. They allowed her to go out, and\r\nshe presently returned with two pieces of cloth or linen,—one with two\r\nknots, the other with one tied in it. Immediately on seeing these\r\narticles, the \"afflicted children\" were \"greatly[ii.216] affrighted,\"\r\nand fell into violent fits. When they came to, they declared that the\r\n\"black man,\" Mrs. Hawkes, and the negro, stood by the puppets of rags,\r\nand pinched them. Whereupon they fell into fits again. \"A bit of one of\r\nthe rags being set on fire,\" they all shrieked that they were burned,\r\nand \"cried out dreadfully.\" Some pieces being dipped in water, they\r\nwent into the convulsions and struggles of drowning persons; and one of\r\nthem rushed out of the room, and raced down towards the river.\r\n\r\nCandy and the girls having played their parts so well, there was no\r\nescape for poor Mrs. Hawkes but in confession, which she forthwith\r\nmade. They were both committed to prison. Fortunately, it was not\r\nconvenient to bring them to trial until the next January, when, the\r\ndelusion having blown over, they were acquitted.\r\n\r\nBesides those already mentioned, there were others, among the victims\r\nof this delusion, whose cases excite our tenderest sensibility, and\r\ndeepen our horror in the contemplation of the scene. It seems, that,\r\nsome time before the transactions took place in Salem Village, a\r\ndifficulty arose between two families on the borders of Topsfield and\r\nIpswich, such as often occur among neighbors, about some small matter\r\nof property, fences, or boundaries. Their names were Perley and How. A\r\ndaughter of Perley, about ten years of age, hearing, probably, strong\r\nexpressions by her parents, became excited against the Hows, and\r\ncharged the wife of How with bewitching her. She acted much[ii.217]\r\nafter the manner of the \"afflicted girls\" in Salem Village, which was\r\nnear the place of her residence. Very soon the idea became current that\r\nMrs. How was a witch; and every thing that happened amiss to any one\r\nwas laid at her door. She was cried out against by the \"afflicted\r\nchildren\" in Salem Village, and carried before the magistrates for\r\nexamination on the 31st of May, 1692. Upon being brought into her\r\npresence, the accusers fell into their usual fits and convulsions, and\r\ncharged her with tormenting them. To the question, put by the\r\nmagistrates, \"What say you to this charge?\" her answer was, \"If it was\r\nthe last moment I was to live, God knows I am innocent of any thing in\r\nthis nature.\" The papers connected with her trial bear abundant\r\ntestimony to the excellent character of this pious and amiable woman. A\r\nperson, who had lived near her twenty-four years, states, in her\r\ndeposition, \"that she had found her a neighborly woman, conscientious\r\nin her dealing, faithful to her promises, and Christianlike in her\r\nconversation.\" Several others join in a deposition to this effect: \"For\r\nour own parts, we have been well acquainted with her for above twenty\r\nyears. We never saw but that she carried it very well, and that both\r\nher words and actions were always such as well became a good\r\nChristian.\"\r\n\r\nThe following passages illustrate the wicked arts sometimes used to\r\nbring accusations upon innocent persons, and give affecting proof of\r\nthe excellence of the character and heart of Elizabeth How:[ii.218]—\r\n\r\n\"The Testimony of Samuel Phillips, aged about sixty-seven, minister of\r\nthe word of God in Rowley, who saith that Mr. Payson (minister of God's\r\nword also in Rowley) and myself went, being desired, to Samuel Perly,\r\nof Ipswich, to see their young daughter, who was visited with strange\r\nfits; and, in her fits (as her father and mother affirmed), did mention\r\nGoodwife How, the wife of James How, Jr., of Ipswich, as if she was in\r\nthe house, and did afflict her. When we were in the house, the child\r\nhad one of her fits, but made no mention of Goodwife How; and, when the\r\nfit was over, and she came to herself, Goodwife How went to the child,\r\nand took her by the hand, and asked her whether she had ever done her\r\nany hurt; and she answered, 'No, never; and, if I did complain of you\r\nin my fits, I knew not that I did so.' I further can affirm, upon oath,\r\nthat young Samuel Perley, brother to the afflicted girl, looked out of\r\na chamber window (I and the afflicted child being without doors\r\ntogether), and said to his sister, 'Say Goodwife How is a witch,—say\r\nshe is a witch;' and the child spake not a word that way. But I looked\r\nup to the window where the youth stood, and rebuked him for his\r\nboldness to stir up his sister to accuse the said Goodwife How; whereas\r\nshe had cleared her from doing any hurt to his sister in both our\r\nhearing; and I added, 'No wonder that the child, in her fits, did\r\nmention Goodwife How, when her nearest relations were so frequent in\r\nexpressing their suspicions, in the child's hearing, when she was out\r\nof her fits, that the said Goodwife How was an instrument of mischief\r\nto the child.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Payson, in reference to the same occasion, deposed as\r\nfollows:[ii.219]—\r\n\r\n\"Being in Perley's house some considerable time before the said\r\nGoodwife How came in, their afflicted daughter, upon something that her\r\nmother spake to her with tartness, presently fell into one of her usual\r\nstrange fits, during which she made no mention (as I observed) of the\r\nabovesaid How her name, or any thing relating to her. Some time after,\r\nthe said How came in, when said girl had recovered her capacity, her\r\nfit being over. Said How took said girl by the hand, and asked her\r\nwhether she had ever done her any hurt. The child answered, 'No;\r\nnever,' with several expressions to that purpose.\"\r\n\r\nThe bearing of Elizabeth How, under accusations so cruelly and\r\nshamefully fabricated and circulated against her, exhibits one of the\r\nmost beautiful pictures of a truly forgiving spirit and of Christlike\r\nlove anywhere to be found. Several witnesses say, \"We often spoke to\r\nher of some things that were reported of her, that gave some suspicion\r\nof that she is now charged with; and she, always professing her\r\ninnocency, often desired our prayers to God for her, that God would\r\nkeep her in his fear, and support her under her burden. We have often\r\nheard her speaking of those persons that raised those reports of her,\r\nand we never heard her speak badly of them for the same; but, in our\r\nhearing, hath often said that she desired God that he would sanctify\r\nthat affliction, as well as others, for her spiritual good.\" Others\r\ntestified to the same effect. Simon Chapman, and Mary, his wife, say\r\nthat \"they had been acquainted with the wife of James How, Jr., as a\r\nneighbor, for this nine or[ii.220] ten years;\" that they had resided in\r\nthe same house with her \"by the fortnight together;\" that they never\r\nknew any thing but what was good in her. They \"found, at all times, by\r\nher discourse, she was a woman of affliction, and mourning for sin in\r\nherself and others; and, when she met with any affliction, she seemed\r\nto justify God and say that it was all better than she deserved, though\r\nit was by false accusations from men. She used to bless God that she\r\ngot good by affliction; for it made her examine her own heart. We never\r\nheard her revile any person that hath accused her with witchcraft, but\r\npitied them, and said, 'I pray God forgive them; for they harm\r\nthemselves more than me. Though I am a great sinner, I am clear of\r\nthat; and such kind of affliction doth but set me to examining my own\r\nheart, and I find God wonderfully supporting me and comforting me by\r\nhis word and promises.'\"\r\n\r\nJoseph Knowlton and his wife Mary, who had lived near her, and\r\nsometimes in the same family with her, testified, that, having heard\r\nthe stories told about her, they were led to—\r\n\r\n\"take special notice of her life and conversation ever since. And I\r\nhave asked her if she could freely forgive them that raised such\r\nreports of her. She told me yes, with all her heart, desiring that God\r\nwould give her a heart to be more humble under such a providence; and,\r\nfurther, she said she was willing to do any good she could to those who\r\nhad done unneighborly by her. Also this I have taken notice, that she\r\nwould deny herself to do a neighbor a good turn.\" [ii.221]\r\n\r\nThe father of her husband,—James How, Sr., aged about ninety-four\r\nyears,—in a communication addressed to the Court, declared that—\r\n\r\n\"he, living by her for about thirty years, hath taken notice that she\r\nhath carried it well becoming her place, as a daughter, as a wife, in\r\nall relations, setting aside human infirmities, as becometh a\r\nChristian; with respect to myself as a father, very dutifully; and as a\r\nwife to my son, very careful, loving, obedient, and kind,—considering\r\nhis want of eyesight, tenderly leading him about by the hand. Desiring\r\nGod may guide your honors, ... I rest yours to serve.\"\r\n\r\nThe only evidence against this good woman—beyond the outcries and fits\r\nof the \"afflicted children,\" enacted in their usual skilful and artful\r\nstyle—consisted of the most wretched gossip ever circulated in an\r\nignorant and benighted community. It came from people in the back\r\nsettlements of Ipswich and Topsfield, and disclosed a depth of absurd\r\nand brutal superstition, which it is difficult to believe ever existed\r\nin New England. So far as those living in secluded and remote\r\nlocalities are regarded, this was the most benighted period of our\r\nhistory. Except where, as in Salem Village, special circumstances had\r\nkept up the general intelligence, there was much darkness on the\r\npopular mind. The education that came over with the first emigrants\r\nfrom the mother-country had gone with them to their graves. The system\r\nof common schools had not begun to produce its fruit in the thinly\r\npeopled outer settlements. There is no more disgraceful page in our\r\nannals than that which[ii.222] details the testimony given at the\r\ntrial, and records the conviction and execution, of Elizabeth How.\r\n\r\nBut the dark shadows of that day of folly, cruelty, and crime, served\r\nto bring into a brighter and purer light virtues exhibited by many\r\npersons. We meet affecting instances, all along, of family fidelity and\r\ntrue Christian benevolence. James How, as has been stated, was stricken\r\nwith blindness. He had two daughters, Mary and Abigail. Although their\r\nfarm was out of the line of the public-roads, travel very difficult,\r\nand they must have encountered many hardships, annoyances, and, it is\r\nto be feared, sometimes unfeeling treatment by the way, one of them\r\naccompanied their father, twice every week, to visit their mother in\r\nher prison-walls. They came on horseback; she managing the bridle, and\r\nguiding him by the hand after alighting. Their humble means were\r\nexhausted in these offices of reverence and affection. One of the noble\r\ngirls made her way to Boston, sought out the Governor, and implored a\r\nreprieve for her mother; but in vain. The sight of these young women,\r\nleading their blind father to comfort and provide for their \"honored\r\nmother,—as innocent,\" as they declared her to be, \"of the crime\r\ncharged, as any person in the world,\"—so faithful and constant in their\r\nfilial love and duty, relieved the horrors of the scene; and it ought\r\nto be held in perpetual remembrance. The shame of that day is not, and\r\nwill not be, forgotten; neither should its beauty and glory.\r\n\r\nThe name of Elizabeth How, before marriage, was[ii.223] Jackson. Among\r\nthe accounts rendered against the country for expenses incurred in the\r\nwitchcraft prosecutions are these two items: \"For John Jackson, Sr.,\r\none pair of fetters, five shillings; for John Jackson, Jr., one pair of\r\nfetters, five shillings.\" There is also an item for carrying \"the two\r\nJacksons\" from one jail to another, and back again. No other reference\r\nto them is found among the papers. They were, perhaps, a brother and\r\nnephew of Elizabeth How. There is reason to suppose that her husband,\r\nJames How, Jr., was a nephew of the Rev. Francis Dane, of Andover.\r\n\r\nThe examination of Job Tookey, of Beverly, presents some points worthy\r\nof notice. He is described as a \"laborer,\" but was evidently a person,\r\nalthough perhaps inconsiderate of speech, of more than common\r\ndiscrimination, and not wholly deluded by the fanaticism of the times.\r\nHe is charged with having said that he \"would take Mr. Burroughs's\r\npart;\" \"that he was not the Devil's servant, but the Devil was his.\"\r\nWhen the girls testified that they saw his shape afflicting persons, he\r\nanswered, like a sensible man, if they really saw any such thing, \"it\r\nwas not he, but the Devil in his shape, that hurts the people.\" Susanna\r\nSheldon, Mary Warren, and Ann Putnam, all declared, that, at that very\r\nmoment while the examination was going on, two men and two women and\r\none child \"rose from the dead, and cried, 'Vengeance! vengeance!'\"\r\nNobody else saw or heard any thing: but the girls suddenly became dumb;\r\ntheir eyes were[ii.224] fixed on vacancy, all looking towards the same\r\nspot; and their whole appearance gave assurance of the truth of what\r\nthey said. In a short time, Mary Warren recovered the use of her vocal\r\norgans, and exclaimed, \"There are three men, and three women, and two\r\nchildren. They are all in their winding-sheets: they look pale upon us,\r\nbut red upon Tookey,—red as blood.\" Again, she exclaimed, in a startled\r\nand affrighted manner, \"There is a young child under the table, crying\r\nout for vengeance.\" Elizabeth Booth, pointing to the same place, was\r\nstruck speechless. In this way, the murder of about every one who had\r\ndied at Royal Side, for a year or two past, was put upon Tookey. Some\r\nof them were called by name; the others, the girls pretended not to\r\nrecognize. The wrath and horror of the whole community were excited\r\nagainst him, and he was committed to jail, by the order of the\r\nmagistrates,—Bartholomew Gedney, Jonathan Corwin, and John Hathorne.\r\n\r\nNo character, indeed, however blameless lovely or venerable, was safe.\r\nThe malignant accusers struck at the highest marks, and the consuming\r\nfire of popular frenzy was kindled and attracted towards the most\r\ncommanding objects. Mary Bradbury is described, in the indictment\r\nagainst her, as the \"wife of Captain Thomas Bradbury, of Salisbury, in\r\nthe county of Essex, gentleman.\" A few of the documents that are\r\npreserved, belonging to her case, will give some idea what sort of a\r\nperson she was:[ii.225]—\r\n\r\n\"_The Answer of Mary Bradbury to the Charge of Witchcraft, or\r\nFamiliarity with the Devil._\r\n\r\n\"I do plead 'Not guilty.' I am wholly innocent of any such wickedness,\r\nthrough the goodness of God that have kept me hitherto. I am the\r\nservant of Jesus Christ, and have given myself up to him as my only\r\nLord and Saviour, and to the diligent attendance upon him in all his\r\nholy ordinances, in utter contempt and defiance of the Devil and all\r\nhis works, as horrid and detestable, and, accordingly, have endeavored\r\nto frame my life and conversation according to the rules of his holy\r\nword; and, in that faith and practice, resolve, by the help and\r\nassistance of God, to continue to my life's end.\r\n\r\n\"For the truth of what I say, as to matter of practice, I humbly refer\r\nmyself to my brethren and neighbors that know me, and unto the Searcher\r\nof all hearts, for the truth and uprightness of my heart therein (human\r\nfrailties and unavoidable infirmities excepted, of which I bitterly\r\ncomplain every day).\r\n\r\nMary Bradbury.\"\r\n\r\n\"July 28, 1692.—Concerning my beloved wife, Mary Bradbury, this is what\r\nI have to say: We have been married fifty-five years, and she hath been\r\na loving and faithful wife to me. Unto this day, she hath been\r\nwonderful laborious, diligent, and industrious, in her place and\r\nemployment, about the bringing-up of our family (which have been eleven\r\nchildren of our own, and four grandchildren). She was both prudent and\r\nprovident, of a cheerful spirit, liberal and charitable. She being now\r\nvery aged and weak, and grieved under her affliction, may not be able\r\nto speak much for herself, not being so free of speech as some others\r\nmay be. I hope her life and conversation have been such amongst\r\nher[ii.226] neighbors as gives a better and more real testimony of her\r\nthan can be expressed by words.\r\n\r\n\"Owned by me,\r\n\r\nTho. Bradbury.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. James Allin made oath before Robert Pike, an assistant and\r\nmagistrate, as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"I, having lived nine years at Salisbury in the work of the ministry,\r\nand now four years in the office of a pastor, to my best notice and\r\nobservation of Mrs. Bradbury, she hath lived according to the rules of\r\nthe gospel amongst us; was a constant attender upon the ministry of the\r\nword, and all the ordinances of the gospel; full of works of charity\r\nand mercy to the sick and poor: neither have I seen or heard any thing\r\nof her unbecoming the profession of the gospel.\"\r\n\r\nRobert Pike also affirmed to the truth of Mr. Allin's statement, from\r\n\"upwards of fifty years' experience,\" as did John Pike also: they both\r\ndeclared themselves ready and desirous to give their testimony before\r\nthe Court.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and seventeen of her neighbors—the larger part of them\r\nheads of families, and embracing the most respectable people of that\r\nvicinity—signed their names to a paper, of which the following is a\r\ncopy:—\r\n\r\n\"Concerning Mrs. Bradbury's life and conversation, we, the subscribers,\r\ndo testify, that it was such as became the gospel: she was a lover of\r\nthe ministry, in all appearance, and a diligent attender upon God's\r\nholy ordinances, being of a courteous and peaceable disposition and\r\ncarriage. Neither did any of us (some of whom have lived in the town\r\nwith her[ii.227] above fifty years) ever hear or ever know that she\r\never had any difference or falling-out with any of her neighbors,—man,\r\nwoman, or child,—but was always ready and willing to do for them what\r\nlay in her power night and day, though with hazard of her health, or\r\nother danger. More might be spoken in her commendation, but this for\r\nthe present.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough this aged matron and excellent Christian lady was convicted\r\nand sentenced to death, it is most satisfactory to find that she\r\nescaped from prison, and her life was saved.\r\n\r\nThe following facts show the weight which ought to have been attached\r\nto these statements. The position, as well as character and age, of\r\nMary [Perkins] Bradbury entitled her to the highest consideration, in\r\nthe structure of society at that time. This is recognized in the title\r\n\"Mrs.,\" uniformly given her. She had been noted, through life, for\r\nbusiness capacity, energy, and influence; and, in 1692, was probably\r\nseventy-five years of age, and somewhat infirm in health. Her husband,\r\nThomas Bradbury, had been a prominent character in the colony for more\r\nthan fifty years. In 1641, he was appointed, by the General Court,\r\nClerk of the Writs for Salisbury, with the functions of a magistrate,\r\nto execute all sorts of legal processes in that place. He was a deputy\r\nin 1651 and many subsequent years; a commissioner for Salisbury in\r\n1657, empowered to act in all criminal cases, and bind over offenders,\r\nwhere it was proper, to higher courts, to take testimonies upon oath,\r\nand to join persons in marriage. He was required to keep a record of\r\nall his[ii.228] doings. If the parties agreed to that effect, he was\r\nauthorized to hear and determine cases of every kind and degree,\r\nwithout the intervention of a jury. The towns north of the Merrimac,\r\nand all beyond now within the limits of New Hampshire, constituted the\r\nCounty of Norfolk; and Thomas Bradbury, for a long series of years, was\r\none of its commissioners and associate judges. From the first, he was\r\nconspicuous in military matters; having been commissioned by the\r\nGeneral Court, in 1648, Ensign of the trainband in Salisbury. He rose\r\nto its command; and, in the latter portion of his life, was universally\r\nspoken of as \"Captain Bradbury.\" All along, the records of the General\r\nCourt, for half a century, demonstrate the estimation in which he was\r\nheld; various important trusts and special services requiring integrity\r\nand ability being from time to time committed to him. His family was\r\ninfluentially connected. His son William married the widow of Samuel\r\nMaverick, Jr., who was the son of one of the King's Commissioners in\r\n1664: she was the daughter of the Rev. John Wheelwright, a man of great\r\nnote, intimately related to the celebrated Anne Hutchinson, and united\r\nwith her by sympathy in sentiment and participation in exile.\r\n\r\nRobert Pike, born in 1616, was a magistrate in 1644. He was deputy from\r\nSalisbury in 1648, and many times after; Associate Justice for Norfolk\r\nin 1650; and Assistant in 1682, holding that high station, by annual\r\nelections, to the close of the first charter, and during the whole\r\nperiod of the intervening and insur[ii.229]gent government. He was\r\nnamed as one of the council that succeeded to the House of Assistants,\r\nwhen, under the new charter, Massachusetts became a royal province. He\r\nwas always at the head of military affairs, having been commissioned,\r\nby the General Court, Lieutenant of the Salisbury trainband in 1648;\r\nand, in the later years of his life, he held the rank and title of\r\nmajor. John Pike, probably his son, resided in Hampton in 1691, and was\r\nminister of Dover at his death in 1710.\r\n\r\nSurely, the attestations of such men as the Pikes, father and son, and\r\nthe Rev. James Allin, to the Christian excellence of Mary Bradbury,\r\nmust be allowed to corroborate fully the declarations of her neighbors,\r\nher husband, and herself.\r\n\r\nThe motives and influences that led to her arrest and condemnation in\r\n1692 demand an explanation. The question arises, Why should the\r\nattention of the accusing girls have been led to this aged and most\r\nrespectable woman, living at such a distance, beyond the Merrimac? A\r\ncritical scrutiny of the papers in the case affords a clew leading to\r\nthe true answer.\r\n\r\nThe wife of Sergeant Thomas Putnam, as has been stated (vol. i. p.\r\n253), was Ann Carr of Salisbury. Her father, George Carr, was an early\r\nsettler in that place, and appears to have been an enterprising and\r\nprosperous person. The ferry for the main travel of the country across\r\nthe Merrimac was from points of land owned by him, and always under his\r\ncharge. He was engaged in ship-building,—employing, and[ii.230] having\r\nin his family, young men; among them a son of Zerubabel Endicott,\r\nbearing the same name.\r\n\r\nAmong the papers in the case is the following:—\r\n\r\n\"The Deposition of Richard Carr, who testifieth and saith, that, about\r\nthirteen years ago, presently after some difference that happened to be\r\nbetween my honored father, Mr. George Carr, and Mrs. Bradbury, the\r\nprisoner at the bar, upon a sabbath at noon, as we were riding home, by\r\nthe house of Captain Tho: Bradbury, I saw Mrs. Bradbury go into her\r\ngate, turn the corner of, and immediately there darted out of her gate\r\na blue boar, and darted at my father's horse's legs, which made him\r\nstumble; but I saw it no more. And my father said, 'Boys, what do you\r\nsee?' We both answered, 'A blue boar.'\r\n\r\n\"Zerubabel Endicott testifieth and saith, that I lived at Mr. George\r\nCarr, now deceased, at the time above mentioned, and was present with\r\nMr. George Carr and Mr. Richard Carr. And I also saw a blue boar dart\r\nout of Mr. Bradbury's gate to Mr. George Carr's horse's legs, which\r\nmade him stumble after a strange manner. And I also saw the blue boar\r\ndart from Mr. Carr's horse's legs in at Mrs. Bradbury's window. And Mr.\r\nCarr immediately said, 'Boys, what did you see?' And we both said, 'A\r\nblue boar.' Then said he, 'From whence came it?' And we said, 'Out of\r\nMr. Bradbury's gate.' Then said he, 'I am glad you see it as well as\r\nI.' _Jurat in Curia_, Sept. 9, '92.\"\r\n\r\nStephen Sewall, the clerk of the courts, with his usual eagerness to\r\nmake the most of the testimony against persons accused, adds to the\r\ndeposition the following:[ii.231]—\r\n\r\n\"And they both further say, on their oaths, that Mr. Carr discoursed\r\nwith them, as they went home, about what had happened, and they all\r\nconcluded that it was Mrs. Bradbury that so appeared as a blue boar.\"\r\n\r\nAt the date of this occurrence, Richard Carr was twenty years of age,\r\nand Zerubabel Endicott a lad of of fifteen.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at that there was \"some difference between\"\r\nGeorge Carr and Mrs. Bradbury, if he was in the habit of indulging in\r\nsuch talk about her as he took the leading part in on this occasion. He\r\nevidently encouraged in his \"boys\" the absurd imaginations with which\r\ntheir credulity had been stimulated. They were prepared by preconceived\r\nnotions to witness something preternatural about the premises of Mrs.\r\nBradbury; and, in their jaundiced vision, any animal, moving in and out\r\nof the gate, might naturally assume the likeness of a \"blue boar.\" Such\r\nideas circulating in the family, and among the apprentices of Carr,\r\nwould soon be widely spread. No doubt, Zerubabel, on his visits to his\r\nhome, told wondrous stories about Mrs. Bradbury. His brother Samuel,\r\nthen a youth of eighteen, had his imagination filled with them; and\r\nsome time after, on a voyage to \"Barbadoes and Saltitudos,\" in which\r\nsevere storms and various disasters were experienced, attributed them\r\nall to Mrs. Bradbury; and, \"in a bright moonshining night, sitting upon\r\nthe windlass, to which he had been sent forward to look out for land,\"\r\nthe wild fancies of his excited imagination took effect. He heard\r\n\"a[ii.232] rumbling noise,\" and thought he saw the legs of some person.\r\n\"Presently he was shook, and looked over his shoulder, and saw the\r\nappearance of a woman, from her middle upwards, having a white cap and\r\nwhite neckcloth on her, which then affrighted him very much; and, as he\r\nwas turning of the windlass, he saw the aforesaid two legs.\" Such\r\nsuperstitious phantasms seem to be natural to the experiences of\r\nsailor-life, and perhaps still linger in the forecastle and at the\r\nnight-watch.\r\n\r\nThe habit of maligning Mrs. Bradbury as a witch dated back in the Carr\r\nfamily more than thirteen years, as the following deposition proves. I\r\ngive it precisely as it is in the original. As in a few other instances\r\nin this work, the spelling and punctuation are preserved as\r\ncuriosities. Like all the papers in the case, with one exception,\r\npresented in court against Mrs. Bradbury, it is in the handwriting of\r\nSergeant Thomas Putnam:—\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note: Spelling and punctuation in the passage below are\r\nas in the original.]\r\n\r\n\"The Deposistion of James Carr. who testifieth and saith that about 20\r\nyears agoe one day as I was accidently att the house of mr wheleright\r\nand his daughter the widdow maverick then liued there: and she then did\r\nmost curtuously invite me to com oftener to the house and wondered I\r\nwas grown such a stranger. and with in a few days affter one evening I\r\nwent thether againe: and when I came thether againe: william Bradbery\r\nwas yr who was then a suter to the said widdow but I did not know it\r\ntell affterwards: affter I came in the widdow did so corsely treat the\r\nsd william Bradbery that he went away semeing to be angury:[ii.233]\r\npresently affter this I was taken affter a strange maner as if liueing\r\ncreaturs did run about euery part of my body redy to tare me to peaces\r\nand so I continewed for about 3 qurters of a year by times & I applyed\r\nmyself to doctor Crosbe who gave me a grate deal of visek but could\r\nmake non work tho he steept tobacco in bosit drink he could make non to\r\nwork where upon he tould me that he beleved I was behaged: and I tould\r\nhim I had thought so a good while: and he asked me by hom I tould him I\r\ndid not care for spaking for one was counted an honest woman: but he\r\nuging I tould him and he said he did beleve that mis Bradbery was a\r\ngrat deal worss then goody martin: then presently affter this one night\r\nI being a bed & brod awake there came sumthing to me which I thought\r\nwas a catt and went to strick it ofe the bed and was sezed fast that I\r\ncould not stir hedd nor foot. but by and coming to my strenth I herd\r\nsumthing a coming to me againe and I prepared my self to strick it: and\r\nit coming upon the bed I did strick at it and I beleve I hit it: and\r\nafter that visek would work on me and I beleve in my hart that mis\r\nBradbery the prisoner att the barr has often afflected me by acts of\r\nwicthcraft.\r\n\r\n\"_Jurat in Curia_ Sep.mr. 9. 92.\"[B]\r\n[ii.234]\r\nBut the whole of George Carr's family did not sympathize in this morbid\r\nstate of prejudice, or cherish such foolish and malignant fancies,\r\nagainst Mrs. Bradbury. One of the sons, William, had married, Aug. 20,\r\n1672, Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Pike. It appears, by the following\r\ndeposition, which is in the handwriting of Major Pike, that there had\r\nbeen another love affair between the families, leading to a melancholy\r\nresult, inflaming still more the morbid and malign prejudice against\r\nMrs. Bradbury; but William repudiated it utterly:—\r\n\r\n\"The Testimony of William Carr, aged forty-one, or thereabouts, is that\r\nmy brother John Carr, when he was young, was a man of as good capacity\r\nas most men of his age; but falling in love with Jane True (now wife of\r\nCaptain[ii.235] John March), and my father being persuaded by [——] of\r\nthe family (which I shall not name) not to let him marry so young, my\r\nfather would not give him a portion, whereupon the match broke off,\r\nwhich my brother laid so much to heart that he grew melancholy, and by\r\ndegrees much crazed, not being the man, that he was before, to his\r\ndying day.\r\n\r\n\"I do further testify that my said brother was sick about a fortnight\r\nor three weeks, and then died; and I was present with him when he died.\r\nAnd I do affirm that he died peaceably and quietly, never manifesting\r\nthe least trouble in the world about anybody, nor did not say any thing\r\nof Mrs. Bradbury nor anybody else doing him hurt; and yet I was with\r\nhim till the breath and life were out of his body.\"\r\n\r\nThe usual form, _jurat in curia_, is written at the foot of this\r\ndeposition, but evidently by a much later hand; and this leads me to\r\nmention the improbability that any testimony in favor of the accused\r\never reached the Court at the trials. They had no counsel: the\r\nattorney-general had prejudged all the cases; and his mind and those of\r\nthe judges repudiated utterly any thing like an investigation. Every\r\nfriendly voice was silenced. The doors were closed against the defence.\r\nRobert Pike, an assistant under the old and a councillor under the new\r\ngovernment, endeavored in vain to enter them.\r\n\r\nWilliam Carr was a person of great respectability, and bore the\r\nappointment, by the General Court, of land-surveyor for the towns in\r\nthe northern part of the present county of Essex.\r\n\r\nThe member of the family who—as stated in the[ii.236] foregoing\r\ndeposition—prevented the match, all the circumstances seem to indicate,\r\nwas Mrs. Ann Putnam. She perhaps had experienced the effects of a too\r\nearly marriage, bringing the burden of life upon the constitution and\r\nthe character before they are mature enough to bear it. She may have\r\nattributed to this cause the troubles and trials with which her cup had\r\nbeen so bitterly filled, and the blasting of the happiness of her\r\nyouth. Half deranged, as perpetual excitement from the parish quarrels\r\nin reference to Mr. Bayley had made her, she may have become morbidly\r\nopposed to the equally early marriage of a brother. Added to this was\r\nthe fact that Henry True had married one of Mrs. Bradbury's daughters,\r\nand that Jane True was his sister. It cannot be doubted that she\r\nentertained the same ideas about Mrs. Bradbury as her father and\r\nbrothers, James and Richard; and, for this reason, also opposed the\r\nmatch of her brother John. Wishing to be relieved from the\r\nself-reproach of having caused his derangement and death, when the\r\nwitchcraft delusion broke out at Salem Village and she became wholly\r\nabsorbed by it, as all other deaths and misfortunes were ascribed to\r\nit, she avowed and maintained the belief, as some had suspected at the\r\ntime, that the happiness, health, reason, and life of her brother had\r\nbeen destroyed by diabolical agency, practised by Mrs. Bradbury.\r\n\r\nIn the state of things long subsisting between the Bradbury and Carr\r\nfamilies, we find an explanation of the movement made against Mrs.\r\nBradbury. Young[ii.237] Ann Putnam may have often heard her\r\nunpleasantly spoken of by her mother, and it was natural that she\r\nshould have \"cried out against her.\"\r\n\r\nThe family of Mrs. Ann Putnam seem to have had constitutional traits\r\nthat illustrate and explain her own character and conduct. They were\r\nexcitable and sensitive to an extraordinary degree. Their judgment,\r\nreason, and physical systems, were subject to the power of their\r\nfancies and affections. One of her brothers, in consequence of being\r\nbadly coquetted with and jilted by a young widow, was thrown into an\r\nawful condition of body and mind \"for about three-quarters of a year.\"\r\nThe reason, health, and heart of another were broken; and he sunk into\r\nan early grave, in consequence of having been crossed in love. The\r\ndeath of her sister Bayley may have been caused by the unhappy\r\ncontroversies in the village parish. We have seen, and shall see, the\r\nall but maniac condition to which excitement brought her own mind. At\r\nlast, the heaviest blow that can fall upon a fond wife suddenly snapped\r\nthe brittle cord of her life. These considerations must be borne in\r\nmind, while we attempt to explain her conduct, and should throw the\r\nweight of pity and charity into the scales, if mortal judgment ventures\r\nto estimate her guilt. They are known to the Infinite Mind, and never\r\noverlooked by divine mercy.\r\n\r\nI have introduced these singular private details to illustrate what the\r\ndocuments all along show,—that the proceedings against persons charged\r\nwith witch[ii.238]craft, in 1692, were instigated by all sorts of\r\npersonal grudges and private piques, many of them of long standing,\r\nfomented and kept alive by an unhappy indulgence of unworthy feelings,\r\nalways ready to mix themselves with popular excitements, and leading\r\nall concerned headlong to the utmost extent of mischief and wrong.\r\n\r\nThe case of Mary Bradbury has been allowed to occupy so large a space,\r\nbecause I desire to disabuse the public mind of a great error on this\r\nsubject. It has been too much supposed, that the sufferers in the\r\nwitchcraft delusion were generally of the inferior classes of society,\r\nand particularly ignorant and benighted. They were the very reverse.\r\nThey mostly belonged to families in the better conditions of life, and,\r\nmany of them, to the highest social level. They were all persons of\r\ngreat moral firmness and rectitude, as was demonstrated by their\r\nbearing under persecutions and outrage, and when confronting the\r\nterrors of death. Their names do not deserve reproach, and their\r\nmemories ought to be held in honor.\r\n\r\nThe following account of the examination of Elizabeth Cary of\r\nCharlestown, given by her husband, Captain Cary, a shipmaster, has the\r\nhighest interest, as written at the time by one who was an eye-witness,\r\nand participated in the sufferings of the occasion:—\r\n\r\n\"May 24.—I having heard, some days, that my wife was accused of\r\nwitchcraft; being much disturbed at it, by advice went to Salem\r\nVillage, to see if the afflicted knew her: we arrived there on the 24th\r\nof May. It happened[ii.239] to be a day appointed for examination;\r\naccordingly, soon after our arrival, Mr. Hathorne and Mr. Corwin, &c.,\r\nwent to the meeting-house, which was the place appointed for that work.\r\nThe minister began with prayer; and, having taken care to get a\r\nconvenient place, I observed that the afflicted were two girls of about\r\nten years old, and about two or three others of about eighteen: one of\r\nthe girls talked most, and could discern more than the rest.\r\n\r\n\"The prisoners were called in one by one, and, as they came in, were\r\ncried out at, &c. The prisoners were placed about seven or eight feet\r\nfrom the justices, and the accusers between the justices and them. The\r\nprisoners were ordered to stand right before the justices, with an\r\nofficer appointed to hold each hand, lest they should therewith afflict\r\nthem: and the prisoners' eyes must be constantly on the justices; for,\r\nif they looked on the afflicted, they would either fall into fits, or\r\ncry out of being hurt by them. After an examination of the prisoners,\r\nwho it was afflicted these girls, &c., they were put upon saying the\r\nLord's Prayer, as a trial of their guilt. After the afflicted seemed to\r\nbe out of their fits, they would look steadfastly on some one person,\r\nand frequently not speak; and then the justices said they were struck\r\ndumb, and after a little time would speak again: then the justices said\r\nto the accusers, 'Which of you will go and touch the prisoner at the\r\nbar?' Then the most courageous would adventure, but, before they had\r\nmade three steps, would ordinarily fall down as in a fit: the justices\r\nordered that they should be taken up and carried to the prisoner, that\r\nshe might touch them; and as soon as they were touched by the accused,\r\nthe justices would say, 'They are well,' before I could discern any\r\nalteration,—by which I observed that the justices understood the manner\r\nof it.[ii.240] Thus far I was only as a spectator: my wife also was\r\nthere part of the time, but no notice was taken of her by the\r\nafflicted, except once or twice they came to her, and asked her name.\r\nBut I, having an opportunity to discourse Mr. Hale (with whom I had\r\nformerly acquaintance), I took his advice what I had best do, and\r\ndesired of him that I might have an opportunity to speak with her that\r\naccused my wife; which he promised should be, I acquainting him that I\r\nreposed my trust in him. Accordingly, he came to me after the\r\nexamination was over, and told me I had now an opportunity to speak\r\nwith the said accuser, Abigail Williams, a girl eleven or twelve years\r\nold; but that we could not be in private at Mr. Parris's house, as he\r\nhad promised me: we went therefore into the alehouse, where an Indian\r\nman attended us, who, it seems, was one of the afflicted; to him we\r\ngave some cider: he showed several scars, that seemed as if they had\r\nbeen long there, and showed them as done by witchcraft, and acquainted\r\nus that his wife, who also was a slave, was imprisoned for witchcraft.\r\nAnd now, instead of one accuser, they all came in, and began to tumble\r\ndown like swine; and then three women were called in to attend them. We\r\nin the room were all at a stand to see who they would cry out of; but\r\nin a short time they cried out 'Cary;' and, immediately after, a\r\nwarrant was sent from the justices to bring my wife before them, who\r\nwere sitting in a chamber near by, waiting for this. Being brought\r\nbefore the justices, her chief accusers were two girls. My wife\r\ndeclared to the justices, that she never had any knowledge of them\r\nbefore that day. She was forced to stand with her arms stretched out. I\r\nrequested that I might hold one of her hands, but it was denied me:\r\nthen she desired me to wipe the tears from her eyes, and the sweat from\r\nher[ii.241] face, which I did; then she desired she might lean herself\r\non me, saying she should faint. Justice Hathorne replied she had\r\nstrength enough to torment these persons, and she should have strength\r\nenough to stand. I speaking something against their cruel proceedings,\r\nthey commanded me to be silent, or else I should be turned out of the\r\nroom. The Indian before mentioned was also brought in, to be one of her\r\naccusers; being come in, he now (when before the justices) fell down,\r\nand tumbled about like a hog, but said nothing. The justices asked the\r\ngirls who afflicted the Indian: they answered she (meaning my wife),\r\nand that she now lay upon him. The justices ordered her to touch him,\r\nin order to his cure, but her head must be turned another way, lest,\r\ninstead of curing, she should make him worse by her looking on him, her\r\nhand being guided to take hold of his; but the Indian took hold of her\r\nhand, and pulled her down on the floor in a barbarous manner: then his\r\nhand was taken off, and her hand put on his, and the cure was quickly\r\nwrought. I being extremely troubled at their inhuman dealings, uttered\r\na hasty speech, 'That God would take vengeance on them, and desired\r\nthat God would deliver us out of the hands of unmerciful men.' Then her\r\n_mittimus_ was writ. I did with difficulty and charge obtain the\r\nliberty of a room, but no beds in it; if there had been, could have\r\ntaken but little rest that night. She was committed to Boston prison;\r\nbut I obtained a _habeas corpus_ to remove her to Cambridge prison,\r\nwhich is in our county of Middlesex. Having been there one night, next\r\nmorning the jailer put irons on her legs (having received such a\r\ncommand); the weight of them was about eight pounds: these irons and\r\nher other afflictions soon brought her into con[ii.242]vulsion fits, so\r\nthat I thought she would have died that night. I sent to entreat that\r\nthe irons might be taken off; but all entreaties were in vain, if it\r\nwould have saved her life, so that in this condition she must continue.\r\nThe trials at Salem coming on, I went thither to see how things were\r\nmanaged: and finding that the spectre evidence was there received,\r\ntogether with idle, if not malicious stories, against people's lives, I\r\ndid easily perceive which way the rest would go; for the same evidence\r\nthat served for one would serve for all the rest. I acquainted her with\r\nher danger; and that, if she were carried to Salem to be tried, I\r\nfeared she would never return. I did my utmost that she might have her\r\ntrial in our own county; I with several others petitioning the judge\r\nfor it, and were put in hopes of it: but I soon saw so much, that I\r\nunderstood thereby it was not intended; which put me upon consulting\r\nthe means of her escape, which, through the goodness of God, was\r\neffected, and she got to Rhode Island, but soon found herself not safe\r\nwhen there, by reason of the pursuit after her; from thence she went to\r\nNew York, along with some others that had escaped their cruel hands,\r\nwhere we found his Excellency Benjamin Fletcher, Esq., Governor, who\r\nwas very courteous to us. After this, some of my goods were seized in a\r\nfriend's hands, with whom I had left them, and myself imprisoned by the\r\nsheriff, and kept in custody half a day, and then dismissed; but to\r\nspeak of their usage of the prisoners, and the inhumanity shown to them\r\nat the time of their execution, no sober Christian could bear. They had\r\nalso trials of cruel mockings, which is the more, considering what a\r\npeople for religion, I mean the profession of it, we have been; those\r\nthat suffered being many of[ii.243] them church members, and most of\r\nthem unspotted in their conversation, till their adversary the Devil\r\ntook up this method for accusing them.\r\n\r\nJonathan Cary.\"\r\n\r\nThe only account we have, written by one who had actually experienced,\r\nin his own person, what it was to fall into the hands of those who got\r\nup and carried on the prosecutions, is the following. Captain Alden had\r\nprobably been from an early stage in their operations in the eye of the\r\naccusing girls. He was meant, perhaps, by what often fell from them\r\nabout \"the tall man in Boston.\" We are left entirely to conjecture as\r\nto the reason why they singled him out, as not one of them, we may be\r\nquite sure, had ever seen him. It may be that some person who had\r\nexperienced discipline under his orders as a naval commander bore him a\r\ngrudge, and took pains to suggest his name to the girls, and provided\r\nthem with the coarse, vulgar, and ridiculous scandal they so recklessly\r\npoured out upon him:—\r\n\r\n\"_An Account how John Alden, Sr., was dealt with at Salem Village._\r\n\r\n\"John Alden, Sr., of Boston, in the county of Suffolk, mariner, on the\r\ntwenty-eighth day of May, 1692, was sent for by the magistrates of\r\nSalem, in the county of Essex, upon the accusation of a company of poor\r\ndistracted or possessed creatures or witches; and, being sent by Mr.\r\nStoughton, arrived there on the 31st of May, and appeared at Salem\r\nVillage before Mr. Gedney, Mr. Hathorne, and Mr. Corwin.\r\n\r\n\"Those wenches being present who played their jug[ii.244]gling tricks,\r\nfalling down, crying out, and staring in people's faces, the\r\nmagistrates demanded of them several times, who it was, of all the\r\npeople in the room, that hurt them. One of these accusers pointed\r\nseveral times at one Captain Hill, there present, but spake nothing.\r\nThe same accuser had a man standing at her back to hold her up. He\r\nstooped down to her ear: then she cried out, 'Alden, Alden afflicted\r\nher.' One of the magistrates asked her if she had ever seen Alden. She\r\nanswered, 'No.' He asked her how she knew it was Alden. She said the\r\nman told her so.\r\n\r\n\"Then all were ordered to go down into the street, where a ring was\r\nmade; and the same accuser cried out, 'There stands Alden, a bold\r\nfellow, with his hat on before the judges: he sells powder and shot to\r\nthe Indians and French, and lies with the Indian squaws, and has Indian\r\npapooses.' Then was Alden committed to the marshal's custody, and his\r\nsword taken from him; for they said he afflicted them with his sword.\r\nAfter some hours, Alden was sent for to the meeting-house in the\r\nVillage, before the magistrates, who required Alden to stand upon a\r\nchair, to the open view of all the people.\r\n\r\n\"The accusers cried out that Alden pinched them then, when he stood\r\nupon the chair, in the sight of all the people, a good way distant from\r\nthem. One of the magistrates bid the marshal to hold open Alden's\r\nhands, that he might not pinch those creatures. Alden asked them why\r\nthey should think that he should come to that village to afflict those\r\npersons that he never knew or saw before. Mr. Gedney bid Alden to\r\nconfess, and give glory to God. Alden said he hoped he should give\r\nglory to God, and hoped he should never gratify the Devil: but appealed\r\nto all that ever knew him, if they ever suspected him to be such a\r\nperson;[ii.245] and challenged any one that could bring in any thing on\r\ntheir own knowledge, that might give suspicion of his being such an\r\none. Mr. Gedney said he had known Alden many years, and had been at sea\r\nwith him, and always looked upon him to be an honest man; but now he\r\nsaw cause to alter his judgment. Alden answered, he was sorry for that,\r\nbut he hoped God would clear up his innocency, that he would recall\r\nthat judgment again; and added, that he hoped that he should, with Job,\r\nmaintain his integrity till he died. They bid Alden look upon the\r\naccusers, which he did, and then they fell down. Alden asked Mr. Gedney\r\nwhat reason there could be given why Alden's looking upon _him_ did not\r\nstrike _him_ down as well; but no reason was given that I heard. But\r\nthe accusers were brought to Alden to touch them; and this touch, they\r\nsaid, made them well. Alden began to speak of the providence of God in\r\nsuffering these creatures to accuse innocent persons. Mr. Noyes asked\r\nAlden why he should offer to speak of the providence of God: God, by\r\nhis providence (said Mr. Noyes), governs the world, and keeps it in\r\npeace; and so went on with discourse, and stopped Alden's mouth as to\r\nthat. Alden told Mr. Gedney that he could assure him that there was a\r\nlying spirit in them; for I can assure you that there is not a word of\r\ntruth in all these say of me. But Alden was again committed to the\r\nmarshal, and his _mittimus_ written.\r\n\r\n\"To Boston Alden was carried by a constable: no bail would be taken for\r\nhim, but was delivered to the prison-keeper, where he remained fifteen\r\nweeks; and then, observing the manner of trials, and evidence then\r\ntaken, was at length prevailed with to make his escape.\r\n\r\n\"Per John Alden.\" [ii.246]\r\n\r\nAlden made his escape about the middle of September, at the bloodiest\r\ncrisis of the tragedy, and just before the execution of nine of the\r\nvictims, including that of Giles Corey. He is understood to have fled\r\nto Duxbury, where his relatives secreted him. He made his appearance\r\namong them late at night; and, on their asking an explanation of his\r\nunexpected visit at that hour, replied that he was flying from the\r\nDevil, and the Devil was after him. After a while, when the delusion\r\nhad abated, and people were coming to their senses, he delivered\r\nhimself up, and was bound over to the Superior Court at Boston, the\r\nlast Tuesday in April, 1693, when, no one appearing to prosecute, he,\r\nwith some hundred and fifty others, was discharged by proclamation, and\r\nall judicial proceedings brought to a close. It is to be feared, that\r\never after, to his dying day, when the subject of his experience on the\r\n31st of May, 1692, was referred to, the old sailor indulged in rather\r\nstrong expressions in relating his reminiscences of Rev. \"Mr. Nicholas\r\nNoyes,\" \"Mr. Bartholomew Gedney,\" and the \"wenches\" of Salem Village.\r\n\r\nCaptain John Alden was a son of John Alden, ever memorable as one of\r\nthe first founders of Plymouth Colony. He had been for more than thirty\r\nyears a resident of Boston, a member of the church, and in all respects\r\na leading and distinguished man. For some time, he had been commander\r\nof the armed vessel belonging to the colony, and was a brave and\r\nefficient officer and an able and experienced mari[ii.247]ner. He had\r\nseen service in French and Indian wars, had acted two years before,\r\nthat is in 1690, as commissioner in conducting negotiations with the\r\nnative tribes, and, at a later period, was charged with important\r\ntrusts as a naval commander. He was a man of large property, and\r\nseventy years of age. He was, as well he might be, utterly confounded\r\nand amazed in finding himself charged as a principal culprit in the\r\nSalem witchcraft. The accusing girls were evidently delighted to get\r\nhold of such a notable and doughty character; and their tongues were\r\nreleased, on the occasion, from all restraints of decorum and decency.\r\nWhen the ring was formed around him \"in the street,\" in front of Deacon\r\nIngersoll's door, his sword unbuckled from his side, and such foul and\r\nvulgar aspersions cast upon his good name, he felt, no doubt, that it\r\nwould have been better to have fallen into the hands of savages of the\r\nwilderness or pirates on the sea, than of the crowd of audacious girls\r\nthat hustled him about in Salem Village. It was a relief to his wounded\r\nhonor, and gave leisure for the workings of his indignant resentment,\r\nto escape from them into Boston jail. Not only his old shipmate,\r\nBartholomew Gedney, but, as will be seen, the learned attorney-general,\r\nwho was present, and witnessed the whole affair, was fully convinced of\r\nhis guilt.\r\n\r\nThe wife of an honest and worthy man in Andover was sick of a fever.\r\nAfter all the usual means had failed to check the symptoms of her\r\ndisease, the idea[ii.248] became prevalent that she was suffering under\r\nan \"evil hand.\" The husband, pursuant of the advice of friends, posted\r\ndown to Salem Village to ascertain from the afflicted girls who was\r\nbewitching his wife. Two of them returned with him to Andover. Never\r\ndid a place receive such fatal visitors. The Grecian horse did not\r\nbring greater consternation to ancient Ilium. Immediately after their\r\narrival, they succeeded in getting more than fifty of the inhabitants\r\ninto prison, several of whom were hanged. A perfect panic swept like a\r\nhurricane over the place. The idea seized all minds, as Hutchinson\r\nexpresses it, that the only \"way to prevent an accusation was to become\r\nan accuser.\"—\"The number of the afflicted increased every day, and the\r\nnumber of the accused in proportion.\" In this state of things, such a\r\ngreat accession being made to the ranks of the confessing witches, the\r\npower of the delusion became irresistibly strengthened. Mr. Dudley\r\nBradstreet, the magistrate of the place, after having committed about\r\nforty persons to jail, concluded he had done enough, and declined to\r\narrest any more. The consequence was that he and his wife were cried\r\nout upon, and they had to fly for their lives. They accused his\r\nbrother, John Bradstreet, with having \"afflicted\" a dog. Bradstreet\r\nescaped by flight. The dog was executed. The number of persons who had\r\npublicly confessed that they had entered into a league with Satan, and\r\nexercised the diabolical power thus acquired, to the injury, torment,\r\nand death of innocent parties, pro[ii.249]duced a profound effect upon\r\nthe public mind. At the same time, the accusers had everywhere\r\nincreased in number, owing to the inflamed state of imagination\r\nuniversally prevalent which ascribed all ailments or diseases to the\r\nagency of witches, to a mere love of notoriety and a passion for\r\ngeneral sympathy, to a desire to be secure against the charge of\r\nbewitching others, or to a malicious disposition to wreak vengeance\r\nupon enemies. The prisons in Salem, Ipswich, Boston, and Cambridge,\r\nwere crowded. All the securities of society were dissolved. Every man's\r\nlife was at the mercy of every other man. Fear sat on every\r\ncountenance, terror and distress were in all hearts, silence pervaded\r\nthe streets; all who could, quit the country; business was at a stand;\r\na conviction sunk into the minds of men, that a dark and infernal\r\nconfederacy had got foot-hold in the land, threatening to overthrow and\r\nextirpate religion and morality, and establish the kingdom of the\r\nPrince of darkness in a country which had been dedicated, by the\r\nprayers and tears and sufferings of its pious fathers, to the Church of\r\nChrist and the service and worship of the true God. The feeling, dismal\r\nand horrible indeed, became general, that the providence of God was\r\nremoved from them; that Satan was let loose, and he and his\r\nconfederates had free and unrestrained power to go to and fro,\r\ntorturing and destroying whomever he willed. We cannot, by any extent\r\nof research or power of imagination, enter fully into the ideas of the\r\npeople of that day; and it is there[ii.250]fore absolutely impossible\r\nto appreciate the awful condition of the community at the point of time\r\nto which our narrative has led us.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this state of things, the old colony of Massachusetts\r\nwas transformed into a royal province, and a new government organized.\r\nSir William Phips, the governor, arrived at Boston, with the new\r\ncharter, on the evening of the 14th of May. William Stoughton, of\r\nDorchester, superseded Thomas Danforth as deputy-governor. In the\r\nCouncil, which took the place of the Assistants, most of the former\r\nbody were retained. Bartholomew Gedney had a few years before been\r\ndropped from the board of Assistants. He was now placed in the Council\r\nwith John Hathorne, Jonathan Corwin, Samuel Appleton, and Robert Pike,\r\nof this county. The new government did not interfere with the\r\nproceedings in progress relating to the witchcraft prosecutions, at the\r\nmoment. Examinations and commitments went on as before; only the\r\nmagistrates, acting on those occasions, were re-enforced by Mr. Gedney,\r\nwho presided at their sessions. The affair had become so formidable,\r\nand the public infatuation had reached such a point, that it was\r\ndifficult to determine what ought to be done. Sir William Phips, no\r\ndoubt, felt that it was beyond his depth, and yielded himself to the\r\nviews of the leading men of his council. Stoughton was in full sympathy\r\nwith Cotton Mather, whose interest had been used in procuring his\r\nappointment over Danforth. Through him, Mather acquired, and held for\r\nsome time, great as[ii.251]cendency with the governor. It was concluded\r\nbest to appoint a special court of Oyer and Terminer for the witchcraft\r\ntrials. Stoughton, the deputy-governor, was commissioned as\r\nchief-justice. Nathaniel Saltonstall of Haverhill; Major John Richards\r\nof Boston; Major Bartholomew Gedney of Salem; Mr. Wait Winthrop,\r\nCaptain Samuel Sewall, and Mr. Peter Sargent, all three of Boston,—were\r\nmade associate judges. Saltonstall early withdrew from the service; and\r\nJonathan Corwin, of Salem, succeeded to his place on the bench of the\r\nspecial court. A majority of the judges were citizens of Boston.\r\n\r\nJonathan Corwin had been associated with Hathorne in conducting the\r\nexaminations that have been described. He was a son of George Corwin,\r\nwho has been noticed in the account of Salem Village.\r\n\r\nA shade of illegality rests upon the very existence of this special\r\ncourt. There has always been a question whether the new charter gave to\r\nthe governor and council power to create it without the concurrence of\r\nthe House of Representatives. It has been held that such a court could\r\nhave no other lawful foundation than an act of the General Court.\r\nHutchinson was evidently of this opinion. This question was a very\r\nserious one; for, as that considerate and able historian and eminent\r\njudicial officer says, the tribunal that passed sentence in the\r\nwitchcraft prosecutions was \"the most important court to the life of\r\nthe subject which was ever held in the province.\" The time required to\r\nconvene the popular branch of the[ii.252] government is itself, in all\r\ncases, an element of safety. In this case, it would have carried the\r\ncountry beyond the period of the delusion, and saved its annals from\r\ntheir darkest and bloodiest page. The condition of things when he\r\narrived, had his counsellors been wise, would have led Sir William\r\nPhips forthwith to issue writs of election of deputies, before taking\r\nany action whatever. In a free republican government, the executive\r\ndepartment ought never to attempt to dispose of difficult matters of\r\nvital importance without the joint deliberations and responsibility of\r\nthe representatives of the people.\r\n\r\nSo far as the composition of the court is considered, no objection can\r\nbe made. The justices were all members of the council, and belonged to\r\nthe highest order, not only of the magistracy, but of society\r\ngenerally. They constituted as respectable a body of gentlemen as could\r\nhave been collected. Thomas Newton, of Boston, was commissioned to act\r\nas attorney-general. The official title of marshal ceasing with the new\r\ngovernment, George Corwin was appointed sheriff of the county of Essex.\r\nHerrick appears to have continued in the service as deputy. Sheriff\r\nCorwin was twenty-six years of age. He was the grandson of the original\r\nGeorge Corwin, and the son of John. His mother was grand-daughter of\r\nGovernor Winthrop of Massachusetts, and daughter of Governor Winthrop\r\nof Connecticut. His wife was a daughter of Bartholomew Gedney; so that\r\nit appears that two of the judges were his uncles, and one his[ii.253]\r\nfather-in-law. These personal connections may be borne in mind, as\r\naffording ground to believe, that, in the discharge of his painful\r\nduties, he did not act without advice and suggestions from the highest\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nThe court-house in which the trials were held stood in the middle of\r\nwhat is now Washington Street, near where Lynde and Church Streets,\r\nwhich did not then exist, now enter it, fronting towards Essex Street.\r\nThe building was also used as a town-house; Washington Street being,\r\nfor this reason, then called \"Town-house Lane.\" Off against the\r\ncourt-house, on the west side of the lane, was the house of the Rev.\r\nNicholas Noyes, on the site of the residence of the late Robert\r\nBrookhouse. Opposite to it was the estate of Edward Bishop, which\r\nfronted westerly on \"Town-house Lane\" a little over a hundred feet,\r\nincluding the present Jeffrey Court, and extending a few feet beyond\r\nthe corner of the house of Dr. S.M. Cate, over a portion of Church\r\nStreet. Its depth, towards St. Peter Street, was about three hundred\r\nand forty-five feet. Edward Bishop held this estate in the right of his\r\nwife Bridget, the widow of Thomas Oliver who had died about 1679. Not\r\nlong after this marriage, Bishop removed to his farm at Royal Side. In\r\n1685, the \"old Oliver house\" was either removed or rebuilt, and a new\r\none erected on the same premises, which was occupied by tenants in\r\n1692. These items are given because they will help to illustrate the\r\nnarrative, and enable us to understand points of evidence in the\r\napproaching trial. It is a curious[ii.254] circumstance, that the first\r\npublic victim of the prosecutions, Bridget Bishop, had been the nearest\r\nneighbor and lived directly opposite, to the person who, more than any\r\nother inhabitant of the town, was responsible for the blood that was\r\nshed,—Nicholas Noyes. The jail, at that time, was on the western side\r\nof Prison Lane, now St. Peter Street, north of the point where Federal\r\nStreet now enters it. The meeting-house stood on what has always been\r\nthe site of the First Church. The \"Ship Tavern\" was on ground the front\r\nof which is occupied, at present, by \"West's Block,\" nearly opposite\r\nthe head of Central Street. It had long been owned and kept by John\r\nGedney, Sr. Two of his sons, John and Bartholomew, had married Susanna\r\nand Hannah Clarke. John died in 1685. His widow moved into the family\r\nof her father-in-law; and, after his death in 1688, continued to keep\r\nthe house. In 1698 she was married to Deliverance Parkman, and died in\r\n1728. The tavern, in 1692, was known as the \"Widow Gedney's.\" The\r\nestate had an extensive orchard in the rear, contiguous, along its\r\nnorthern boundary, to the orchard of Bridget Bishop, which occupied\r\nground now covered by the Lyceum building, and one or two others to the\r\neast of it.\r\n\r\nThe Court was opened at Salem in the first week of June, 1692. In the\r\nmean time, the attorney-general, to prepare for the management of the\r\ncases, came to Salem. He addressed the following letter to Isaac\r\nAddington, Secretary of the province:[ii.255]—\r\n\r\n\"Salem, 31st May, 1692.\r\n\r\n\"Worthy Sir,—I have herewith sent you the names of the prisoners that\r\nare desired to be transmitted by _habeas corpus_; and have presumed to\r\nsend you a copy thereof, being more, as I presume, accustomed to that\r\npractice than yourself, and beg pardon if I have infringed upon you\r\ntherein. I fear we shall not this week try all that we have sent for;\r\nby reason the trials will be tedious, and the afflicted persons cannot\r\nreadily give their testimonies, being struck dumb and senseless, for a\r\nseason, at the name of the accused. I have been all this day at the\r\nVillage, with the gentlemen of the council, at the examination of the\r\npersons, where I have beheld strange things, scarce credible but to the\r\nspectators, and too tedious here to relate; and, amongst the rest,\r\nCaptain Alden and Mr. English have their _mittimus_. I must say,\r\naccording to the present appearances of things, they are as deeply\r\nconcerned as the rest; for the afflicted spare no person of what\r\nquality soever, neither conceal their crimes, though never so heinous.\r\nWe pray that Tituba the Indian, and Mrs. Thacher's maid, may be\r\ntransferred as evidence, but desire they may not come amongst the\r\nprisoners but rather by themselves; with the records in the Court of\r\nAssistants, 1679, against Bridget Oliver, and the records relating to\r\nthe first persons committed, left in Mr. Webb's hands by the order of\r\nthe council. I pray pardon that I cannot now further enlarge; and, with\r\nmy cordial service, only add that I am, sir, your most humble servant,\r\n\r\nsignature\r\n\r\n[ii.256]\r\n\r\nHutchinson says that there was no colony or province law against\r\nwitchcraft in force when the trials began; and that the proceedings\r\nwere under an act of James the First, passed in 1603. By that act,\r\npersons convicted were to be sentenced to \"the pains and penalties of\r\ndeath as felons.\" By the colonial law, conviction of capital crimes did\r\nnot incapacitate the party affected from disposing of property. In this\r\nand other respects, there were points of difference, which caused some\r\ninconvenience in carrying out the practice of the mother-country; and\r\nthe attorney-general had to supply the want of experience in the local\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nIt may here be mentioned, that no record of the doings of this special\r\ncourt are now to be found, and our only information respecting them is\r\nobtained in brief and imperfect statements of writers of the time.\r\nPerhaps Hutchinson had the use of the records. He gives the dates of\r\nthe several sessions of the courts, and of the conviction and execution\r\nof the prisoners. Some of the depositions sworn to in court are on\r\nfile, but without giving in many instances the date when thus offered\r\nin the trials. In some cases, they state when they were laid before the\r\ngrand jury. Only a small part of them are preserved. The matter they\r\ncontain was, to a considerable extent, brought forward at the\r\npreliminary examinations, and has been already adduced. In the\r\nfollowing account of the trials, some further use will be made of these\r\ndepositions.\r\n\r\nBridget Bishop was the only person tried at the first session of the\r\nCourt. She was brought through[ii.257] Prison Lane, up Essex Street, by\r\nthe First Church, into Town-house Lane, to the Court-house. Cotton\r\nMather says,—\r\n\r\n\"There was one strange thing with which the court was newly\r\nentertained. As this woman was under a guard, passing by the great and\r\nspacious meeting-house, she gave a look towards the house; and\r\nimmediately a demon, invisibly entering the meeting-house, tore down a\r\npart of it: so that, though there was no person to be seen there, yet\r\nthe people, at the noise, running in, found a board, which was strongly\r\nfastened with several nails, transported into another quarter of the\r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the streets were thronged by crowds eager to get a\r\nsight of the prisoner; and that the doors, fences, and house-tops were\r\noccupied. Some, perhaps, got into the meeting-house; and, in clambering\r\nup to the windows, a board may have been put in requisition, and left\r\nmisplaced. Incredible almost as it is, this circumstance seems, from\r\nMather's language,—\"the court was entertained,\"—to have been brought in\r\nevidence at the trial, and regarded as weighty and conclusive proof of\r\nBridget's guilt.\r\n\r\nOne or two points in the evidence adduced against her, in addition to\r\nthose mentioned heretofore, deserve consideration. The position taken,\r\nat her trial, by the Rev. John Hale of Beverly demands criticism. The\r\ncharge of witchcraft had been made against her on more than one\r\noccasion before; particularly about the year 1687, when she resided\r\nnear the bounds of Beverly, at Royal Side. A woman in the\r\nneighbor[ii.258]hood, subject to fits of insanity, had, while passing\r\ninto one of them, brought the accusation against her; but, on the\r\nreturn of her reason, solemnly recanted, and deeply lamented the\r\naspersion. In a violent recurrence of her malady, this woman committed\r\nsuicide. Mr. Hale had examined the case at the time, and exonerated\r\nBridget Bishop, who was a communicant in his church, from the charge\r\nmade against her by the unhappy lunatic. He was satisfied, as he\r\nstates, that \"Sister Bishop\" was innocent, and in no way deserved to be\r\nill thought of. He hoped \"better of said Goody Bishop at that time.\"\r\nWithout any pretence of new evidence touching the facts of the case, he\r\ncame into court in 1692, and related them, to the effect and with the\r\nintent to make them bear against her. He described the appearance of\r\nthe throat of the woman, after death, as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"As to the wounds she died of, I observed three deadly ones; a piece of\r\nher windpipe cut out, and another wound above that through the windpipe\r\nand gullet, and the vein they call jugular. So that I then judged and\r\nstill do apprehend it impossible for her, with so short a pair of\r\nscissors, to mangle herself so without some extraordinary work of the\r\nDevil or witchcraft.\"\r\n\r\nIf this was his impression at the time, it is strange that he did not\r\nthen say so. But there is no appearance of any criminal proceedings\r\nhaving been had, by the grand jury or otherwise, against \"Sister\r\nBishop\" on the occasion. On the contrary, Mr. Hale seems to have\r\nacquiesced in the opinion, that the derangement of[ii.259] the woman\r\nwas aggravated, if not caused, by her being overmuch given to searching\r\nand pondering upon the dark passages and mysterious imagery of\r\nprophecy. The truth, in all probability, is, that Mr. Hale's suspicion\r\nwas an after-thought. The effect produced upon his mental condition by\r\nthe statements and actings of the \"afflicted children\" in 1692 was\r\nunconsciously transferred to 1687. The delusion, in which he was then\r\nfully participating, led him to put a different interpretation upon the\r\nsuicidal wounds and horrible end of the wretched maniac, five or six\r\nyears before.\r\n\r\nA piece of evidence, which illustrates the state of opinion at that\r\ntime, relating to our subject, given in this case, is worthy of notice.\r\nSamuel Shattuck was a hatter and dyer. His house was on the south side\r\nof Essex Street, opposite the western entrance to the grounds of the\r\nNorth Church. Before her removal to the village, Bridget Bishop was in\r\nthe habit of calling at Shattuck's to have articles of dress dyed. He\r\nstates that she treated him and his family politely and kindly; or, as\r\nhe characterized her deportment after his mind had become jaundiced\r\nagainst her, \"in a smooth and flattering manner.\" He tells his story in\r\na deposition written by him, and signed and sworn to in Court by\r\nhimself and wife, June 2, 1692. It is as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"Our eldest child, who promised as much health and understanding, both\r\nby countenance and actions, as any other children of his years, was\r\ntaken in a very drooping[ii.260] condition; and, as she came oftener to\r\nthe house, he grew worse and worse. As he would be standing at the\r\ndoor, would fall out, and bruise his face upon a great step-stone, as\r\nif he had been thrust out by an invisible hand; oftentimes falling, and\r\nhitting his face against the sides of the house, bruising his face in a\r\nvery miserable manner.... This child taken in a terrible fit, his mouth\r\nand eyes drawn aside, and gasped in such a manner as if he was upon the\r\npoint of death. After this, he grew worse in his fits, and, out of\r\nthem, would be almost always crying. That, for many months, he would be\r\ncrying till nature's strength was spent, and then would fall asleep,\r\nand then awake, and fall to crying and moaning; and that his very\r\ncountenance did bespeak compassion. And at length, we perceived his\r\nunderstanding decayed: so that we feared (as it has since proved) that\r\nhe would be quite bereft of his wits; for, ever since, he has been\r\nstupefied and void of reason, his fits still following of him. After he\r\nhad been in this kind of sickness some time, he has gone into the\r\ngarden, and has got upon a board of an inch thick, which lay flat upon\r\nthe ground, and we have called him; he would come to the edge of the\r\nboard, and hold out his hand, and make as if he would come, but could\r\nnot till he was helped off the board.... My wife has offered him a cake\r\nand money to come to her; and he has held out his hand, and reached\r\nafter it, but could not come till he had been helped off the board, by\r\nwhich I judge some enchantment kept him on.... Ever since, this child\r\nhath been followed with grievous fits, as if he would never recover\r\nmore; his head and eyes drawn aside so as if they would never come to\r\nrights more; lying as if he were, in a manner, dead; falling anywhere,\r\neither into fire or water, if he be not constantly looked to; and,\r\ngenerally, in such an uneasy,[ii.261] restless frame, almost always\r\nrunning to and fro, acting so strange that I cannot judge otherwise but\r\nthat he is bewitched: and, by these circumstances, do believe that the\r\naforesaid Bridget Oliver—now called Bishop—is the cause of it: and it\r\nhas been the judgment of doctors, such as lived here and foreigners,\r\nthat he is under an evil hand of witchcraft.\"\r\n\r\nThe means used to give this direction to the suspicions of Shattuck and\r\nhis wife are described in the notice of Bridget Bishop, in the First\r\nPart of this work.\r\n\r\nShattuck was a son of the sturdy Quaker of that name who, thirty years\r\nbefore, had given the government of the colony so much trouble, and\r\nseems to have inherited some of his notions. In his deposition, he\r\nmentions, as corroborative proof of Bridget Bishop's being a witch,\r\nthat she used to bring to his dye-house \"sundry pieces of lace,\" of\r\nshapes and dimensions entirely outside of his conceptions of what could\r\nbe needed in the wardrobe, or for the toilet, of a plain and honest\r\nwoman. He evidently regarded fashionable and vain apparel as a snare\r\nand sign of the Devil.\r\n\r\nThe imaginations of several persons in Shattuck's immediate\r\nneighborhood seem to have been wrought up to a high point against\r\nBridget Bishop. John Cook lived on the south side of the street,\r\ndirectly opposite the eastern entrance to the grounds of the North\r\nChurch, on its present site. John Bly's house was on a lot contiguous\r\nto the rear of Cook's, fronting on Summer Street. One of Cook's sons\r\n(John), aged eighteen, testified, that,[ii.262]—\r\n\r\n\"About five or six years ago, one morning about sun-rising, as I was in\r\nbed, before I rose, I saw Goodwife Bishop, _alias_ Oliver, stand in the\r\nchamber by the window: and she looked on me and grinned on me, and\r\npresently struck me on the side of the head, which did very much hurt\r\nme; and then I saw her go out under the end window at a little crevice,\r\nabout so big as I could thrust my hand into. I saw her again the same\r\nday,—which was the sabbath-day,—about noon, walk across the room; and\r\nhaving, at the time, an apple in my hand, it flew out of my hand into\r\nmy mother's lap, who sat six or eight foot distance from me, and then\r\nshe disappeared: and, though my mother and several others were in the\r\nsame room, yet they affirmed they saw her not.\"\r\n\r\nBly and his wife Rebecca had a difficulty with Bishop in reference to\r\npayment for a hog they had bought of her. The following is from their\r\ntestimony at her trial. After stating that she came to their house and\r\nquarrelled with them about it, they go on to say that the animal—\r\n\r\n\"was taken with strange fits, jumping up, and knocking her head against\r\nthe fence, and seemed blind and deaf, and would not eat, neither let\r\nher pigs suck, but foamed at the mouth; which Goody Henderson, hearing\r\nof, said she believed she was overlooked, and that they had their\r\ncattle ill in such a manner at the Eastward, when they lived there, and\r\nused to cure them by giving of them red ochre and milk, which we also\r\ngave the sow. Quickly after eating of which, she grew better; and then,\r\nfor the space of near two hours together, she, getting into the street,\r\ndid set off, jumping and running between the house of said deponents\r\nand said Bishop's, as if[ii.263] she were stark mad, and, after that,\r\nwas well again: and we did then apprehend or judge, and do still, that\r\nsaid Bishop had bewitched said sow.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Stacey testified, that, as he was \"agoing to mill,\" meeting\r\nBishop in the street, some conversation passed between them, and that,—\r\n\r\n\"being gone about six rods from her, the said Bishop, with a small load\r\nin his cart, suddenly the off-wheel slumped or sunk down into a hole\r\nupon plain ground; that this deponent was forced to get one to help him\r\nget the wheel out. Afterwards, this deponent went back to look for said\r\nhole where his wheel sunk in, but could not find any hole.\"\r\n\r\nStacey further deposed, that, on another occasion, he—\r\n\r\n\"met the said Bishop by Isaac Stearns's brick-kiln. After he had passed\r\nby her, this deponent's horse stood still with a small load going up\r\nthe hill; so that, the horse striving to draw, all his gears and\r\ntackling flew in pieces, and the cart fell down.\"\r\n\r\nThese mishaps and marvels occurred in Summer Street, near the foot of\r\nChestnut Street, where the ground was then much lower than it is now.\r\nStacey was ascending the street, on his way through High Street to his\r\nfather's mill, at the South River.\r\n\r\nStacey concluded his testimony as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"This deponent hath met with several other of her pranks at several\r\ntimes, which would take up a great time to tell of.\r\n\r\n\"This deponent doth verily believe that the said Bridget Bishop was\r\ninstrumental to his daughter Priscilla's death.[ii.264] About two years\r\nago, the child was a likely, thriving child; and suddenly screeched\r\nout, and so continued, in an unusual manner, for about a fortnight, and\r\nso died in that lamentable manner.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the extraordinary \"pranks,\" charged upon Bridget Bishop, had\r\ntheir scene near to her dwelling-house. John Louder, a servant of John\r\nGedney, Sr., some years before, had a controversy with her about her\r\nfowls, \"that used to come into our orchard or garden.\" He swore as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n\"Some little time after which, I, going well to bed, about the dead of\r\nthe night, felt a great weight upon my breast, and, awakening, looked;\r\nand, it being bright moonlight, did clearly see said Bridget Bishop, or\r\nher likeness, sitting upon my stomach; and, putting my arms off of the\r\nbed to free myself from the great oppression, she presently laid hold\r\nof my throat, and almost choked me, and I had no strength or power in\r\nmy hands to resist, or help myself; and, in this condition, she held me\r\nto almost day. Some time after this, my mistress (Susannah Gedney) was\r\nin our orchard, and I was then with her; and said Bridget Bishop, being\r\nthen in her orchard,—which was next adjoining to ours,—my mistress told\r\nsaid Bridget that I said or affirmed that she came, one night, and sat\r\nupon my breast, as aforesaid, which she denied, and I affirmed to her\r\nface to be true, and that I did plainly see her; upon which discourse\r\nwith her, she threatened me. And, some time after that, I, being not\r\nvery well, stayed at home on a Lord's Day; and, on the afternoon of\r\nsaid day, the doors being shut, I did see a black pig in the room\r\ncoming towards me; so I went towards it to kick it, and it vanished\r\naway.\" [ii.265]\r\n\r\nLouder goes on to say, that, immediately after this, on the same\r\noccasion while he was staying at home from meeting, he saw a black\r\nthing jump into the window, and it came and stood just before his face\r\n\"upon the bar.\" The body of it looked like a monkey, only the feet were\r\nlike a cock's feet with claws, and the face somewhat more like a man's\r\nthan a monkey's. He says that he was greatly affrighted, \"not being\r\nable to speak or help myself by reason of fear, I suppose;\" and that\r\nhis mysterious visitor made quite a speech to him, representing that it\r\nwas a messenger sent to say, that, if he would \"be ruled by him, he\r\nshould want for nothing in this world.\" The virtuous and indignant\r\nLouder says that he answered, \"You devil, I will kill you!\" and gave it\r\na blow with his fist, but \"could feel no substance; and it jumped out\r\nof the window again.\" It immediately came in by the porch, although the\r\ndoors were shut, and said, \"You had better take my counsel.\" Hereupon\r\nLouder struck at it with a stick, hitting the ground-sill and breaking\r\nthe stick, but felt no substance. Louder concludes his testimony as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n\"The arm with which I struck was presently disenabled. Then it vanished\r\naway, and I opened the back-door and went out; and, going towards the\r\nhouse-end, I espied said Bridget Bishop in her orchard going towards\r\nher house, and, seeing her, had no power to set one foot forward, but\r\nreturned in again: and, going to shut the door, I again did see that or\r\nthe like creature, that I before did see within doors, in such a\r\nposture as it seemed to be agoing to fly at me;[ii.266] upon which I\r\ncried out, 'The whole armor of God be between me and you.' So it sprang\r\nback and flew over the apple-tree, flinging the dirt with its feet\r\nagainst my stomach, upon which I was struck dumb, and so continued for\r\nabout three days' time; and also shook many of the apples off from the\r\ntree which it flew over.\"\r\n\r\nBefore removing to his farm, Edward and Bridget Bishop made the\r\nalterations, before mentioned, on their town estate. John Bly, Sr.,\r\naged fifty-seven years, and William Bly, aged fifteen, were employed in\r\nthe operation of removing the cellar wall of \"the ould house;\" and\r\ntestified, that they found in holes and crevices of said cellar wall\r\n\"several puppets made up of rags and hogs' bristles, with headless pins\r\nin them with the points outward.\"\r\n\r\nUpon such evidence, Bridget Bishop was condemned, and executed the next\r\nweek. The death-warrants, in these trials, were collected together in\r\none envelope, marked as such. The envelope remains, but its contents\r\nhave all been abstracted. The death-warrant of Bridget Bishop was\r\nprobably overlooked when the others were gathered together. The\r\nconsequence is that it has been preserved, and is the only one known to\r\nbe in existence.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff seems to have proceeded, immediately after the execution,\r\nto the clerk's office, and indorsed his return on the warrant. When he\r\nwrote it, he added, after the word \"dead,\"—\"and buried her on the\r\nspot.\" On its occurring to him that the burying of the body was not\r\nmentioned in the warrant, he drew [ii.267] his pen through the words;\r\nas is seen in the photograph. This superfluous clause, thus partially\r\nobliterated, is the only positive evidence we have of the disposal of\r\nthe bodies at the time. They were undoubtedly all thrown into pits dug\r\namong the rocks, on the spot, and hastily covered by the officers\r\nhaving in charge the details of the executions. There were no prayers\r\nover their graves, except those uttered by themselves in their last\r\nmoments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeath warrant\r\n\r\n[View larger image (383K)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreturn on warrant\r\n\r\n[View larger image (327K)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe descendants of Bridget Bishop are very numerous in Salem; embracing\r\nsome of our oldest and most respectable families, and branching widely\r\nfrom them. There is no evidence of issue by her first marriage. Thomas\r\nOliver, her second husband, had daughters by a former wife, who were\r\nrepresented in the next generation under the names of Hilliard, Hooper,\r\nand Jones. By his wife Bridget, he had but one child,—a daughter,\r\nChristian, born May 8, 1667. She married Thomas Mason, and died in\r\n1693; leaving an only child, Susannah, born August 23, 1687. Edward\r\nBishop was her guardian. She married John Becket in 1711, and by him\r\nhad a son, John, and six daughters, as follows: Susannah, married to\r\nDavid Felt, Elizabeth to William Peele, Sarah to Nathaniel Silsbee,\r\nRebecca to William Fairfield, Eunice to Thorndike Deland, and Hannah to\r\nWilliam Cloutman.\r\n\r\nAfter the condemnation of Bridget Bishop, the Court took a recess, and\r\nconsulted the ministers of Boston and the neighborhood respecting the\r\nprosecutions. The response of the reverend gentlemen, while\r\nurging,[ii.268] in general terms, the importance of caution and\r\ncircumspection in the methods of examination, decidedly and earnestly\r\nrecommended that the proceedings should be vigorously carried on; and\r\nthey were, indeed, vigorously carried on.\r\n\r\nHutchinson says, that, \"at the first trial, there was no colony or\r\nprovincial law against witchcraft in force. The statute of James the\r\nFirst must therefore have been considered as in force in the province,\r\nwitchcraft not being an offence at common law. Before the adjournment,\r\nthe old colony law, which makes witchcraft a capital offence, was\r\nrevived with the other local laws, as they were called, and made a law\r\nof the province.\" The General Court, which thus revived the law making\r\nwitchcraft a capital offence, met, June 8, two days before the\r\nexecution of Bridget Bishop. The proceedings that took place at Salem\r\nwere thus assumed as a provincial matter, for which the immediate\r\nlocality was not responsible, but the legislature, clergy, and people\r\nof the country at large.\r\n\r\nThe Court met again on Wednesday, the 29th of June; and, after trial,\r\nsentenced to death Sarah Good, Sarah Wildes, Elizabeth How, Susanna\r\nMartin, and Rebecca Nurse, who were all executed on the 19th of July.\r\n\r\nCalef says, that, at the trial of Sarah Good,—\r\n\r\n\"One of the afflicted fell in a fit; and, after coming out of it, cried\r\nout of the prisoner for stabbing her in the breast with a knife, and\r\nthat she had broken the knife in stabbing of her. Accordingly, a piece\r\nof the blade of a knife was [ii.269]found about her. Immediately,\r\ninformation being given to the Court, a young man was called, who\r\nproduced a haft and part of the blade, which the Court, having viewed\r\nand compared, saw it to be the same; and, upon inquiry, the young man\r\naffirmed that yesterday he happened to break that knife, and that he\r\ncast away the upper part,—this afflicted person being then present. The\r\nyoung man was dismissed and she was bidden by the Court not to tell\r\nlies; and was improved after (as she had been before) to give evidence\r\nagainst the prisoners.\"\r\n\r\nHutchinson, in relating this circumstance, refers to a case tried\r\nbefore Sir Matthew Hale, when a similar kind of falsehood was proved\r\nagainst an \"afflicted\" witness; notwithstanding which he says the\r\nperson on trial was found guilty, \"and the judge and all the court were\r\nfully satisfied with the verdict.\"\r\n\r\nSarah Good appears to have been an unfortunate woman, having been\r\nsubject to poverty, and consequent sadness and melancholy. But she was\r\nnot wholly broken in spirit. Mr. Noyes, at the time of her execution,\r\nurged her very strenuously to confess. Among other things, he told her\r\n\"she was a witch, and that she knew she was a witch.\" She was conscious\r\nof her innocence, and felt that she was oppressed, outraged, trampled\r\nupon, and about to be murdered, under the forms of law; and her\r\nindignation was roused against her persecutors. She could not bear in\r\nsilence the cruel aspersion; and, although she was just about to be\r\nlaunched into eternity, the torrent of her feelings could not be\r\nrestrained, but burst upon[ii.270] the head of him who uttered the\r\nfalse accusation. \"You are a liar,\" said she. \"I am no more a witch\r\nthan you are a wizard; and, if you take away my life, God will give you\r\nblood to drink.\" Hutchinson says that, in his day, there was a\r\ntradition among the people of Salem, and it has descended to the\r\npresent time, that the manner of Mr. Noyes's death strangely verified\r\nthe prediction thus wrung from the incensed spirit of the dying woman.\r\nHe was exceedingly corpulent, of a plethoric habit, and died of an\r\ninternal hemorrhage, bleeding profusely at the mouth.\r\n\r\nWe have no information relating to the execution of Elizabeth How. Her\r\ngentle, patient, humble, benignant, devout, and tender heart bore her,\r\nno doubt, with a spirit of saint-like love and faith, through the\r\ndreadful scenes. We cannot doubt, that, in death as in life, she\r\nforgave, prayed for, and invoked blessing upon her persecutors. Neither\r\nhas any thing come down in reference to the deportment of Sarah Wildes\r\nor Susanna Martin. We may take it for granted, that the former was a\r\npatient and humble, but firm and faithful sufferer; and that the latter\r\ndisplayed the great energy of spirit, and probably the strength of\r\nlanguage, for which she was remarkable. Of the case of Rebecca Nurse we\r\nhave more information.\r\n\r\nThe character, age, and position of this venerable matron created an\r\nimpression, which called, to the utmost, all the arts and efforts of\r\nthe prosecution to counteract. Many who had gone fully and earnestly in\r\nsupport of the proceedings against others paused[ii.271] and hesitated\r\nin reference to her; and large numbers who had been overawed into\r\nsilence before, bravely came forward in her defence. The character of\r\nNathaniel Putnam has been described. He was a man of extraordinary\r\nstrength and acuteness of mind, and in all his previous life had been\r\nproof against popular excitement. The death of his brother Thomas,\r\nseven years before, had left him the head and patriarch of his great\r\nfamily: as such, he was known as \"Landlord Putnam.\" Entire confidence\r\nwas felt by all in his judgment, and deservedly. But he was a strong\r\nreligionist, a life-long member of the Church, and extremely strenuous\r\nand zealous in his ecclesiastical relations. He was getting to be an\r\nold man; and Mr. Parris had wholly succeeded in obtaining, for the\r\ntime, possession of his feelings, sympathy, and zeal in the management\r\nof the Church, and secured his full co-operation in the witchcraft\r\nprosecutions. He had been led by Parris to take the very front in the\r\nproceedings. But even Nathaniel Putnam could not stand by in silence,\r\nand see Rebecca Nurse sacrificed. A curious paper, written by him, is\r\namong those which have been preserved:—\r\n\r\n\"Nathaniel Putnam, Sr., being desired by Francis Nurse, Sr., to give\r\ninformation of what I could say concerning his wife's life and\r\nconversation, I, the abovesaid, have known this said aforesaid woman\r\nforty years, and what I have observed of her, human frailties excepted,\r\nher life and conversation have been according to her profession; and\r\nshe hath brought up a great family of children and educated[ii.272]\r\nthem well, so that there is in some of them apparent savor of\r\ngodliness. I have known her differ with her neighbors; but I never knew\r\nor heard of any that did accuse her of what she is now charged with.\"\r\n\r\nA similar paper was signed by thirty-nine other persons of the village\r\nand the immediate vicinity, all of the highest respectability. The men\r\nand women who dared to do this act of justice must not be forgotten:—\r\n\r\n\"We whose names are hereunto subscribed, being desired by Goodman Nurse\r\nto declare what we know concerning his wife's conversation for time\r\npast,—we can testify, to all whom it may concern, that we have known\r\nher for many years; and, according to our observation, her life and\r\nconversation were according to her profession, and we never had any\r\ncause or grounds to suspect her of any such thing as she is now accused\r\nof.\r\n\r\n\"Israel Porter.

It was the influence of the magistracy and the\r\ngovernment of the colony, and the public sentiment prevalent elsewhere,\r\noverruling that of the immediate locality, that drove on the storm.\r\n\r\nIsrael Porter was the head of a great and powerful family. His wife\r\nElizabeth was, as has been stated, a sister of Hathorne, the examining\r\nmagistrate. Edward and Hannah Bishop were the venerable heads and\r\nfounders of a large family. They lived in Beverly, and must each have\r\nbeen about ninety years of age. The list contains the names of the\r\nheads of the principal families in the village,—such as John and\r\nRebecca Putnam, the Hutchinsons, Reas, Leaches, Houltons, and Herricks;\r\nand, in the neighborhood, such as the Feltons, Osbornes, and Samuel\r\nEndicott. The most remarkable fact it discloses is that it contains the\r\nname of one of the two complainants who procured the warrant against\r\nRebecca Nurse,—Jonathan Putnam, the eldest son of John; and also of his\r\nwife Lydia. Subsequent reflection, and the return of his better\r\njudgment, satisfied him that he had done a great wrong to an innocent\r\nand worthy person; and he had the manliness to come out in her favor.\r\nThis document ought to have been effectual in saving the life of\r\nRebecca Nurse. It will for ever vindicate her character, and reflect\r\nhonor upon each and every name subscribed to it.[ii.274]\r\n\r\nOne of the most cruel features in the prosecution of the witchcraft\r\ntrials, and which was practised in all countries where they took place,\r\nwas the examination of the bodies of the prisoners by a jury of the\r\nsame sex, under the direction and in the presence of a surgeon or\r\nphysician. The person was wholly exposed, and every part subjected to\r\nthe most searching scrutiny. The process was always an outrage upon\r\nhuman nature; and in the cases of the victims on this occasion, many of\r\nthem of venerable years and delicate feelings, it was shocking to every\r\nnatural and instinctive sentiment. There is reason to fear that it was\r\noften conducted in a rough, coarse, and brutal manner. Marshal Herrick\r\ntestifies, that, \"by order of Their Majesties' justices,\" he,\r\naccompanied by the jail-keeper Dounton, and Constable Joseph Neal, made\r\nan examination of the body of George Jacobs. In persons of his great\r\nage, there would, in all likelihood, be shrivelled, desiccated, and\r\ncallous places. They found one on the old man, under his right\r\nshoulder. Herrick made oath that it was a veritable witch teat, and his\r\ndeposition describes it as follows: \"About a quarter of an inch long or\r\nbetter, with a sharp point drooping downwards, so that I took a pin,\r\nand run it through the said teat; but there was neither water, blood,\r\nor corruption, nor any other matter.\" As proof positive that this was\r\n\"the Devil's mark,\" Herrick and the turnkey testify that \"the said\r\nJacobs was not in the least sensible of what had been done\"!\r\n\r\nThe mind loathes the thought of handling in this[ii.275] way refined\r\nand sensitive females of matronly character, or persons of either sex,\r\nwith infirmities of body rendered sacred by years. The results of the\r\nexamination were reduced to written reports, going into details, and,\r\namong other evidences in the trials, spread before the Court and\r\njury.[C]\r\n\r\nThe evidence in the case of Rebecca Nurse was made up of the usual\r\nrepresentations and actings of the \"afflicted children.\" Mary Walcot\r\nand Abigail Williams charged her with having committed several murders;\r\nmentioning particularly Benjamin Houlton, John Harwood, and Rebecca\r\nShepard, and averring that she was aided therein by her sister Cloyse.\r\nMr. Parris, too, gave in a deposition against her; from which it\r\nap[ii.276]pears, that, a certain person being sick, Mercy Lewis was\r\nsent for. She was struck dumb on entering the chamber. She was asked to\r\nhold up her hand, if she saw any of the witches afflicting the patient.\r\nPresently she held up her hand, then fell into a trance; and after a\r\nwhile, coming to herself, said that she saw the spectres of Goody Nurse\r\nand Goody Carrier having hold of the head of the sick man. Mr. Parris\r\nswore to this statement with the utmost confidence in Mercy's\r\ndeclarations.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of three persons particularly is required to be given, as\r\nillustrating the extraordinary extent to which the minds of those\r\ninvolved in the affair were under infatuation or hallucination.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ann Putnam was about thirty years of age. For six months she had\r\nbeen constantly absorbed in what was then, as now, regarded as\r\nspiritualism. Her[ii.277] house had been the scene of a perpetual\r\nseries of wonders supposed to be disclosures and manifestations of a\r\nsupernatural character. Apparitions, spectral shapes of living witches,\r\nghosts of their murdered victims, and demons generally, were of daily\r\nand hourly occurrence. The dread secrets of the world unknown had been\r\nrevealed to her in waking fancies and dreams by night. An originally\r\nsensitive and imaginative nature had been wrought into a condition in\r\nwhich her mental faculties were at once enfeebled and exalted. Besides\r\nall this, there were the trials to which her constitution had been\r\nsubjected by the experiences of maternity so early begun, and the\r\npressure upon her mind and heart of the anxieties and cares incident to\r\na large family of young children. An accumulation of disappointments,\r\nvexations, and consuming griefs, spread like a dark cloud over her\r\nlife,—the deaths of her own children, and of her sister Bayley and her\r\nchildren, and of her sister Baker's children; and, finally, the\r\nlong-continued, and constantly recurring sufferings, tortures,\r\nconvulsions, fits, and trances of her daughter Ann, and her\r\nservant-woman Mercy Lewis, under, as she fully believed, a diabolical\r\nhand.—These things must have given to her countenance and tones of\r\nvoice a wonderful impressiveness to all who looked upon or listened to\r\nthem. Her eminent social position, her general reputation,—for Lawson,\r\nwho knew her well, calls her \"a very sober and pious woman,\" so far as\r\nhe could judge,—the stamp of profound earnestness marked on all\r\nher[ii.278] language, the glow which morbid excitement long experienced\r\ngave to her expression, must have arrested, to a high degree, the\r\nattention of the assembled multitude. An air of sadness, in the wild\r\nravings of imagination, pervades her testimony. I present her\r\ndeposition in full, as one of the phenomena of this strange\r\ntransaction:—\r\n\r\n\"The Deposition of Ann Putnam, the wife of Thomas Putnam, aged about\r\nthirty years, who testifieth and saith, that, on the 18th March, 1692,\r\nI being wearied out in helping to tend my poor afflicted child and\r\nmaid, about the middle of the afternoon I lay me down on the bed to\r\ntake a little rest; and immediately I was almost pressed and choked to\r\ndeath, that, had it not been for the mercy of a gracious God and the\r\nhelp of those that were with me, I could not have lived many moments:\r\nand presently I saw the apparition of Martha Corey, who did torture me\r\nso as I cannot express, ready to tear me all to pieces, and then\r\ndeparted from me a little while; but, before I could recover strength\r\nor well take breath, the apparition of Martha Corey fell upon me again\r\nwith dreadful tortures, and hellish temptation to go along with her.\r\nAnd she also brought to me a little red book in her hand and a black\r\npen, urging me vehemently to write in her book; and several times that\r\nday she did most grievously torture me, almost ready to kill me. And,\r\non the 19th March, Martha Corey again appeared to me; and also Rebecca\r\nNurse, the wife of Francis Nurse, Sr.: and they both did torture me a\r\ngreat many times this day with such tortures as no tongue can express,\r\nbecause I would not yield to their hellish temptations, that, had I not\r\nbeen upheld by an Almighty arm, I could not have lived[ii.279] while\r\nnight. The 20th March, being sabbath-day, I had a great deal of respite\r\nbetween my fits. 21st March, being the day of the examination of Martha\r\nCorey, I had not many fits, though I was very weak; my strength being,\r\nas I thought, almost gone: but, on the 22d March, 1692, the apparition\r\nof Rebecca Nurse did again set upon me in a most dreadful manner, very\r\nearly in the morning, as soon as it was well light. And now she\r\nappeared to me only in her shift, and brought a little red book in her\r\nhand, urging me vehemently to write in her book; and, because I would\r\nnot yield to her hellish temptations, she threatened to tear my soul\r\nout of my body, blasphemously denying the blessed God, and the power of\r\nthe Lord Jesus Christ to save my soul; and denying several places of\r\nScripture which I told her of, to repel her hellish temptations. And\r\nfor near two hours together, at this time, the apparition of Rebecca\r\nNurse did tempt and torture me, and also the greater part of this day,\r\nwith but very little respite. 23d March, am again afflicted by the\r\napparitions of Rebecca Nurse and Martha Corey, but chiefly by Rebecca\r\nNurse. 24th March, being the day of the examination of Rebecca Nurse, I\r\nwas several times afflicted in the morning by the apparition of Rebecca\r\nNurse, but most dreadfully tortured by her in the time of her\r\nexamination, insomuch that the honored magistrates gave my husband\r\nleave to carry me out of the meeting-house; and, as soon as I was\r\ncarried out of the meeting-house doors, it pleased Almighty God, for\r\nhis free grace and mercy's sake, to deliver me out of the paws of those\r\nroaring lions, and jaws of those tearing bears, that, ever since that\r\ntime, they have not had power so to afflict me until this 31st May,\r\n1692. At the same moment that I was hearing my evidence read by the\r\nhonored magistrates, to take my[ii.280] oath, I was again re-assaulted\r\nand tortured by my before-mentioned tormentor, Rebecca Nurse.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Testimony of Ann Putnam, Jr., witnesseth and saith, that, being in\r\nthe room when her mother was afflicted, she saw Martha Corey, Sarah\r\nCloyse, and Rebecca Nurse, or their apparition, upon her mother.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Ann Putnam made another deposition under oath, at the same trial,\r\nwhich shows that she was determined to overwhelm the prisoner by the\r\nmultitude of her charges. She says that Rebecca Nurse's apparition\r\ndeclared to her that \"she had killed Benjamin Houlton, John Fuller, and\r\nRebecca Shepard;\" and that she and her sister Cloyse, and Edward\r\nBishop's wife, had killed young John Putnam's child; and she further\r\ndeposed as followeth:—\r\n\r\n\"Immediately there did appear to me six children in winding-sheets,\r\nwhich called me aunt, which did most grievously affright me; and they\r\ntold me that they were my sister Baker's children of Boston; and that\r\nGoody Nurse, and Mistress Carey of Charlestown, and an old deaf woman\r\nat Boston, had murdered them, and charged me to go and tell these\r\nthings to the magistrates, or else they would tear me to pieces, for\r\ntheir blood did cry for vengeance. Also there appeared to me my own\r\nsister Bayley and three of her children in winding-sheets, and told me\r\nthat Goody Nurse had murdered them.\"\r\n\r\nThere is in this deposition a passage which illustrates one of the\r\ndoctrines held at the time on the subject of witchcraft. Mrs. Ann\r\nPutnam \"testifieth and saith, that, on the first day of June, 1692,\r\nthe[ii.281] apparition of Rebecca Nurse did again fall upon me, and\r\nalmost choke me; and she told me, that, now she was come out of prison,\r\nshe had power to afflict me, and that now she would afflict me all this\r\nday long.\" The reference here is probably to the fact, that, on the 1st\r\nof June, she with many other prisoners was transferred from the jail in\r\nBoston to that in Salem; and that, \"all that day long\" being outside of\r\nprison walls, she had greater power to afflict than when chained in a\r\ncell. This was undoubtedly the received opinion, and it is curiously\r\nillustrated in the foregoing passage.\r\n\r\nThe only breath of disparagement against the character of Goodwife\r\nNurse that can be found in any of the papers is in the following\r\ndeposition:—\r\n\r\n\"The Deposition of Sarah Houlton, relict of Benjamin Houlton, deceased,\r\nwho testifieth and saith, that, about this time three years, my dear\r\nand loving husband, Benjamin Houlton, deceased, was as well as ever I\r\nknew him in my life till one Saturday morning, that Rebecca Nurse, who\r\nnow stands charged for witchcraft, came to our house, and fell a\r\nrailing at him because our pigs got into her field. Though our pigs\r\nwere sufficiently yoked, and their fence was down in several places,\r\nyet all we could say to her could no ways pacify her; but she continued\r\nrailing and scolding a great while together, calling to her son Benj.\r\nNurse to go and get a gun and kill our pigs, and let none of them go\r\nout of the field, though my poor husband gave her never a misbeholding\r\nword. And, within a short time after this, my poor husband going out\r\nvery early in the morning, as he[ii.282] was coming in again, he was\r\ntaken with a strange fit in the entry; being struck blind and stricken\r\ndown two or three times, so that, when he came to himself, he told me\r\nhe thought he should never have come into the house any more. And, all\r\nsummer after, he continued in a languishing condition, being much\r\npained at his stomach, and often struck blind: but, about a fortnight\r\nbefore he died, he was taken with strange and violent fits, acting much\r\nlike to our poor bewitched persons when we thought they would have\r\ndied; and the doctor that was with him could not find what his\r\ndistemper was. And, the day before he died, he was very cheerly; but,\r\nabout midnight, he was again most violently seized upon with violent\r\nfits, till the next night, about midnight, he departed this life by a\r\ncruel death.\r\n\r\n\"_Jurat in Curia._\"\r\n\r\nIn explanation of the import of this testimony, it is to be observed,\r\nthat the estate of Benjamin Houlton was contiguous to that of Francis\r\nNurse. They were separated by a fence, which, as in such cases, was\r\nrequired for half its length to be kept in order by one party, the\r\nremaining half by the other. What the exact facts were cannot be\r\nascertained, as we have the story of one side only. The widow Houlton\r\nappears to have been a tender-hearted, and, for aught we know, good\r\nwoman. Some years afterwards, she was married, as his second wife, to\r\nBenjamin Putnam,—a very respectable person, and, on the death of his\r\nfather Nathaniel, the head of that branch of the family. He was, for\r\nmany years, deacon of the church. But she was, it must be conceded, a\r\nprejudiced witness; and[ii.283] her judgment for the time was wholly\r\nbeclouded by the prevalent superstitions. The garden had been, from the\r\ndays of Townsend Bishop, a choice portion of the Nurse estate. In all\r\nfarms, it was a most important and valuable item; and was generally\r\nunder the special care and management of the wife, daughters, and\r\nyounger lads of the husbandman. Rebecca Nurse was an efficient\r\nhelpmeet; contributing her whole share to the success of the great\r\nenterprise of clearing the estate, as well as in bringing up and\r\neducating a large family. It was, no doubt, very provoking to her, as\r\nit would be to any one, to have vegetable and flower beds devastated by\r\nthe ravages of a neighbor's stray pigs. To what extent her \"railing and\r\nscolding\" went, she was not allowed to contribute her statement, to\r\nenable us to judge. The affair probably produced considerable gossip,\r\nand seems to be alluded to in Nathaniel Putnam's certificate in behalf\r\nof Rebecca Nurse. There is reason to believe that the widow Houlton was\r\none of the first to realize what great injustice had been done by her\r\nand others to the good name of Rebecca Nurse.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this evidence, so deeply were the jury impressed with\r\nthe eminent virtue and true Christian excellence of this venerable\r\nwoman, that, in spite of the clamors of the outside crowd, the\r\nmonstrous statements of accusing witnesses, and the strong leaning of\r\nthe Court against her, the jury brought in a verdict of \"Not guilty.\"\r\nCalef, and Hutchinson after him, describe the effect, and what\r\nfollowed:[ii.284]—\r\n\r\n\"Immediately, all the accusers in the Court, and, suddenly after, all\r\nthe afflicted out of Court, made an hideous outcry; to the amazement,\r\nnot only of the spectators, but the Court also seemed strangely\r\nsurprised. One of the judges expressed himself not satisfied: another\r\nof them, as he was going off the bench, said they would have her\r\nindicted anew. The chief-justice said he would not impose on the jury,\r\nbut intimated as if they had not well considered one expression of the\r\nprisoner when she was upon trial; viz., that when one Hobbs, who had\r\nconfessed herself to be a witch, was brought into Court to witness\r\nagainst her, the prisoner, turning her head to her, said, 'What! do you\r\nbring her? She is one of us;' or words to that effect. This, together\r\nwith the clamors of the accusers, induced the jury to go out again,\r\nafter their verdict, 'Not guilty.'\"\r\n\r\nThe foreman of the jury, Thomas Fisk, made this statement on the 4th of\r\nJuly, a few days after the trial:—\r\n\r\n\"After the honored Court had manifested their dissatisfaction of the\r\nverdict, several of the jury declared themselves desirous to go out\r\nagain, and thereupon the Court gave leave; but, when we came to\r\nconsider the case, I could not tell how to take her words as an\r\nevidence against her, till she had a further opportunity to put her\r\nsense upon them, if she would take it. And then, going into Court, I\r\nmentioned the words aforesaid, which by one of the Court were affirmed\r\nto have been spoken by her, she being then at the bar, but made no\r\nreply nor interpretation of them; whereupon these words were to me a\r\nprincipal evidence against her.\" [ii.285]\r\n\r\nUpon being informed of the use made of her words, the prisoner put in\r\nthe following declaration:—\r\n\r\n\"These presents do humbly show to the honored Court and jury, that I\r\nbeing informed that the jury brought me in guilty upon my saying that\r\nGoodwife Hobbs and her daughter were of our company; but I intended no\r\notherwise than as they were prisoners with us, and therefore did then,\r\nand yet do, judge them not legal evidence against their\r\nfellow-prisoners. And I being something hard of hearing and full of\r\ngrief, none informing me how the Court took up my words, and therefore\r\nhad no opportunity to declare what I intended when I said they were of\r\nour company.\"\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly natural for her to have spoken of them as \"of our\r\ncompany,\" not only from the fact that they had long been crowded\r\ntogether in the same jails, but as they had accompanied each other in\r\nthe transferrence from one jail to another, from time to time. A few\r\ndays before, a large party, of which she was one, had been brought from\r\nBoston, spending the whole day together on the route. Sarah Good, John\r\nProcter and wife, Susanna Martin, Bridget Bishop, and Alice Parker\r\nhappen to be mentioned as belonging to it. Calef further states:—\r\n\r\n\"After her condemnation, the governor saw cause to grant a reprieve,\r\nwhich, when known (and some say immediately upon granting), the\r\naccusers renewed their dismal outcries against her; insomuch that the\r\ngovernor was by some Salem gentlemen prevailed with to recall the\r\nreprieve, and she was executed with the rest.[ii.286]\r\n\r\n\"The testimonials of her Christian behavior, both in the course of her\r\nlife and at her death, and her extraordinary care in educating her\r\nchildren, and setting them a good example, under the hands of so many,\r\nare so numerous, that for brevity they are here omitted.\"\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary conduct of \"the Salem gentlemen,\" in preventing the\r\nintended exercise of executive discretion and clemency on this\r\noccasion, is explained, it is probable, by the fact, stated by Neal in\r\nhis \"History of New England,\" that there was an organized association\r\nof private individuals, a committee of vigilance, in Salem, during the\r\ncontinuance of the delusion, who had undertaken to ferret out and\r\nprosecute all suspected persons. He says that many were arrested and\r\nthrown into prison by their influence and interference. It is hardly to\r\nbe doubted, that the persons who busied themselves to prevent the\r\nreprieve of Rebecca Nurse acted under the authority and by the\r\ndirection of this self-constituted body of inquisitors. The agency of\r\nsuch unauthorized and irresponsible combinations is always of\r\nquestionable expediency. When acting in the same line with an excited\r\npopulace, they are extremely dangerous.\r\n\r\nThere is no more disgraceful record in the judicial annals of the\r\ncountry, than that which relates the trial of this excellent woman. The\r\nwave of popular fury made a clear breach over the judgment-seat. The\r\nloud and malignant outcry of an infatuated mob, inside and outside of\r\nthe Court-house, instead of being yielded to, ought to have been, not\r\nonly sternly rebuked, but[ii.287] visited with prompt and exemplary\r\npunishment. The judges were not only overcome and intimidated from the\r\nfaithful discharge of their sacred duty by a clamoring crowd, but they\r\nplayed into their hands. Hutchinson justly remarks, that their conduct\r\nwas in violation of that rule to execute \"law and justice in mercy,\"\r\nwhich ought always to be written on their hearts. \"In a capital case,\r\nthe Court often refuses a verdict of 'Guilty;' but rarely, if ever,\r\nsends a jury out again upon one of 'Not guilty.'\" The statement made by\r\nthe foreman of the jury, with the subsequent explanation of the\r\nprisoner, taken in connection with the ground on which the\r\nchief-justice sent the jury out again after rendering their verdict of\r\n\"Not guilty,\" made it the duty of the Court and the executive to give\r\nto her the benefit of that verdict.\r\n\r\nAt the trial of her mother, Sarah Nurse—aged twenty-eight years or\r\nthereabouts—offered this piece of testimony: that, \"being in the Court,\r\nthis 29th of June, 1692, I saw Goodwife Bibber pull pins out of her\r\nclothes, and held them between her fingers, and clasped her hands round\r\nher knee; and then she cried out, and said, Goody Nurse pinched her.\"\r\nIn all these trials, Mercy Lewis was a principal witness and actor; yet\r\nwe find, among the papers, testimony from the most respectable and\r\nreliable persons, that she was not to be trusted. There was also\r\ntestimony which ought to have broken the force of the depositions of\r\nAnn Putnam and her mother. Four days after the examination and\r\ncommitment of Rebecca Nurse, John[ii.288] Tarbell and Samuel Nurse went\r\nto the house of Thomas Putnam to find out in what way their mother had\r\nbeen made the object of such shocking accusations. They were men whose\r\ncredibility was never brought in question. Their declarations, on this\r\noccasion, were not disputed, and, if not true, might have been\r\noverthrown; for there were many witnesses of the facts they stated.\r\nTarbell swore as follows: \"Upon discourse of many things, I asked\r\nwhether the girl that was afflicted did first speak of Goody Nurse,\r\nbefore others mentioned her to her. They said she told them she saw the\r\napparition of a pale-faced woman that sat in her grandmother's seat,\r\nbut did not know her name. Then I replied and said, 'But who was it\r\nthat told her that it was Goody Nurse?' Mercy Lewis said it was Goody\r\nPutnam that said it was Goody Nurse. Goody Putnam said that it was\r\nMercy Lewis that told her. Thus they turned it upon one another,\r\nsaying, 'It was you,' and 'It was you that told her.'\" Samuel Nurse\r\ntestified to the same.\r\n\r\nThere was another piece of evidence, which, though brought against\r\nRebecca Nurse, bears harder, as we read it now, upon Ann Putnam than\r\nany one else, and makes it more difficult to palliate her conduct on\r\nthe supposition of partial insanity. It is, all along, one of the\r\nobscure problems of our subject to determine how far delusion may have\r\nbeen accompanied by fraud and imposture. Edward Putnam testified, that\r\n\"Ann Putnam, Jr., was bitten by Rebecca Nurse, as she said, about two\r\nof the clock of the day\" after Rebecca[ii.289] Nurse had been committed\r\nto jail, and while she was several miles distant, in Salem; and the\r\nsaid Nurse also struck said Ann Putnam with her spectral chain, leaving\r\na mark, \"being in a kind of a round ring, and three streaks across the\r\nring: she had six blows with a chain in the space of half an hour; and\r\nshe had one remarkable one, with six streaks across her arm.\" Edward\r\nPutnam swears, \"I saw the mark, both of bite and chains.\" The Court, no\r\ndoubt, were solemnly impressed by this amazing evidence; but it is hard\r\nto avoid the conclusion that Ann Putnam was guilty of elaborate\r\nfalsehood and a studied trick.\r\n\r\nIn the trials at this session, one of the \"afflicted children\" cried\r\nout against the Rev. Samuel Willard, of the Old South Church, in\r\nBoston. \"She was sent out of Court, and it was told about that she was\r\nmistaken in the person.\" There was surely evidence enough against the\r\nhonesty and credibility of the accusers to leave the judges without\r\nexcuse, and justly meriting perpetual condemnation for not paying heed\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nThe case of Rebecca Nurse proves that a verdict could not have been\r\nobtained against a person of her character charged with witchcraft in\r\nthis county, had not the most extraordinary efforts been made by the\r\nprosecuting officer, aided by the whole influence of the Court and\r\nprovincial authorities. The odium of the proceedings at the trials and\r\nat the executions cannot fairly be laid upon Salem, or the people of\r\nthis vicinity.[ii.290]\r\n\r\nBut nothing can extenuate the infamy that must for ever rest upon the\r\nnames of certain parties to the proceedings. Not to attempt here to\r\nmeasure the guilt of the accusing witnesses, it may be mentioned that\r\nit was the deliberate conviction of the family of Rebecca Nurse, that\r\nMr. Parris, more than all other persons, was responsible for her\r\nexecution; whether by his officious activity in driving on the\r\nprosecution, or in preventing her reprieve, cannot be known. Of the\r\nprominent part taken by Mr. Noyes in the cruel treatment of this woman,\r\nthere is no room for doubt. The records of the First Church in Salem\r\nare darkened by the following entry:—\r\n\r\n\"1692, July 3.—After sacrament, the elders propounded to the\r\nchurch,—and it was, by an unanimous vote, consented to,—that our sister\r\nNurse, being a convicted witch by the Court, and condemned to die,\r\nshould be excommunicated; which was accordingly done in the afternoon,\r\nshe being present.\"\r\n\r\nThe scene presented on this occasion must have been truly impressive at\r\nthe time, as it is shocking to us in the retrospect. The action of the\r\nchurch, at the close of the morning service, of course became\r\nuniversally known; and the \"great and spacious meeting-house\" was\r\nthronged by a crowd that filled every nook and corner of its floor,\r\ngalleries, and windows. The sheriff and his subordinates brought in the\r\nprisoner, manacled, and the chains clanking from her aged form. She was\r\nplaced in the broad aisle. Mr.[ii.291] Higginson and Mr. Noyes—the\r\nelders, as the clergy were then called—were in the pulpit. The two\r\nruling elders—who were lay officers—and the two deacons were in their\r\nproper seats, directly below and in front of the pulpit. Mr. Noyes\r\npronounced the dread sentence, which, for such a crime, was then\r\nbelieved to be not merely an expulsion from the church on earth, but an\r\nexclusion from the church in heaven. It was meant to be understood as\r\nan eternal doom. As it had been proved, in his estimation, beyond a\r\nquestion, that she had given her soul to the Devil, he delivered her\r\nover to the great adversary of God and man.\r\n\r\nFrom the dismal cell, which, for but a few days longer, was to hold her\r\nbody, he proclaimed the transferrence of her soul to—\r\n\r\n\"A dungeon horrible on all sides round,\r\nAs one great furnace flamed; yet from those flames\r\nNo light, but rather darkness visible;\r\nRegions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace\r\nAnd rest can never dwell; hope never comes\r\nThat comes to all; but torture without end,\r\nAs far removed from God, and light of heaven,\r\nAs from the centre thrice to the utmost pole.\"\r\n\r\nLanguage and imagery, exhausting the resources of the divine genius of\r\nthe greatest of poets, fail to give expression to what was felt to be\r\nthe import of this fearful sentence. It sunk the recipient of it below\r\nthe reach of human sympathy. She was regarded, by that blinded\r\nmultitude, with a horror that cast out pity, and was full of hate. But\r\nin our view now, and, as we believe, in the view of God and angels\r\nthen, she[ii.292] occupied an infinite height above her persecutors.\r\nHer mind was serenely fixed upon higher scenes, and filled with a peace\r\nwhich the world could not take away, or its cruel wrongs disturb. She\r\nwent back to her prison walls, and then to the scaffold, with a pious\r\nand humble faith which has not failed to be recorded among men, as it\r\nhas been rewarded where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary\r\nare at rest.\r\n\r\nCalef, as already quoted, gives the impression produced by her demeanor\r\nat her death. Hutchinson expresses in the following words the judgment\r\nof history and the sense of all coming times:—\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Noyes, the minister of Salem, a zealous prosecutor, excommunicated\r\nthe poor old woman, and delivered her to Satan, to whom he supposed she\r\nhad formally given herself up many years before; but her life and\r\nconversation had been such, that the remembrance thereof, in a short\r\ntime after, wiped off all the reproach occasioned by the civil or\r\necclesiastical sentence against her.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to close the story of the lot assigned to this good\r\nwoman by an inscrutable Providence, without again contemplating it in a\r\ncondensed recapitulation. In her old age, experiencing a full share of\r\nall the delicate infirmities which the instincts of humanity require to\r\nbe treated with careful and reverent tenderness, she was ruthlessly\r\nsnatched from the bosom of a loving family reared by her pious fidelity\r\nin all Christian graces, from the side of the devoted companion of her\r\nlong life, from a home that was endeared[ii.293] by every grateful\r\nassociation and comfort; immured in the most wretched and crowded\r\njails; kept loaded with irons and bound with cords for months; insulted\r\nand maligned at the preliminary examinations; outraged in her person by\r\nrough and unfeeling handling and scrutiny; and in her rights, by the\r\nmost flagrant and detestable judicial oppression, by which the benefit\r\nof a verdict, given in her favor, had been torn away; carried to the\r\nmeeting-house to receive the sentence of excommunication in a manner\r\ndevised to harrow her most sacred sentiments; and finally carted\r\nthrough the streets by a route every foot of which must have been\r\ndistressing to her infirm and enfeebled frame; made to ascend a rough\r\nand rocky path to the place of execution, and there consigned to the\r\nhangman. Surely, there has seldom been a harder fate.\r\n\r\nHer body was probably thrown with the rest into a hole in the crevices\r\nof the rock, and covered hastily and thinly over by the executioners.\r\nIt has been the constant tradition of the family, that, in some way, it\r\nwas recovered; and the spot is pointed out in the burial-place\r\nbelonging to the estate, where her ashes rest by the side of her\r\nhusband, and in the midst of her children. It is certain, that, at\r\nleast, one other body was thus exhumed, and taken to its own proper\r\nplace of burial. From the known character of Francis Nurse and his sons\r\nand sons-in-law, we may be sure that what others could do they did not\r\nsuffer to remain undone. It is left to the imagination to present the\r\ndetails of the sad and secret enterprise. In the[ii.294] darkness of\r\nmidnight, they found and identified the body, and bore it tenderly in\r\ntheir arms along the silent roads and by-ways, across fields and over\r\nfences, to the old home, where it was received by the assembled family,\r\nmourned over, and cared for; and, during that or the ensuing night,\r\ndeposited, with tears and prayers, in their own consecrated grounds.\r\nHer descendants of successive generations owned and reverently guarded\r\nthe spot. They own and guard it to-day. The interesting reminiscences\r\nconnected with the early history of the Nurse house have been alluded\r\nto. It has witnessed an extraordinary variety of the conditions of\r\ndomestic vicissitude. Scenes rising before the mind in contemplative\r\nretrospection, while gazing upon it, present the extremest contrasts of\r\nhuman experience. On the evening of the 25th of October, 1678, Mary and\r\nElizabeth Nurse were married. Such an occurrence was undoubtedly the\r\noccasion of the highest joy and gladness in a happy household. The old\r\nmansion shone in light, and echoed voices of cheer. How altered its\r\naspect! What darkness and silence brooded over and within it, while\r\nthose same daughters waited, watched, and listened, through the solemn\r\nhours of that night of woe and horror, for the coming of their father,\r\nhusbands, and brothers, bearing to the home, from which she had been so\r\ncruelly torn, the remains of their slaughtered mother!\r\n\r\nThe subsequent history of the house presents a circumstance of singular\r\ninterest in connection with[ii.295] our story. All the members of the\r\nthree branches of the Putnam family, with the exception of Joseph, seem\r\nto have been carried away by the witchcraft delusion, in its early\r\nstages, and were more or less active in pushing on the prosecutions. We\r\nhave seen how fierce was the maniac testimony of Mrs. Ann Putnam and\r\nher daughter against Rebecca Nurse. The lapse of time, by a Providence\r\nthat wonderfully works its ends, has repaired the breaches made by\r\nfolly and wrong. The descendants of the numerous family of Mrs. Ann\r\nPutnam have disappeared from the scene: none of them bearing the name\r\nare in the village. The descendants of Deacon Edward Putnam have also\r\nscattered in emigration to other places. Nathaniel and John, the heads\r\nof the other two branches of the family, although involved in the\r\nwitchcraft delusion, each signed papers in favor of Rebecca Nurse;\r\ntheir descendants, as well as those of Joseph, are still numerous in\r\nthe village, hold their old position of respectability and influence,\r\nand many of them occupy the lands of their ancestors. Stephen, the\r\ngrandson of Nathaniel, married Miriam, the grand-daughter of John.\r\nTheir son Phinehas, in 1784, bought the Nurse homestead from Benjamin\r\nNurse, the great-grandson of Rebecca. Orin Putnam, the great-grandson\r\nof Phinehas, to whom the estate descends, married in 1836 the daughter\r\nof Allen Nurse, a direct descendant of Rebecca, and placed her at the\r\nhead of her old ancestral homestead. The children of that marriage,\r\nwith their father and grandfather, constitute the family[ii.296] that\r\ndwell in and own the venerable mansion. This singular restoration,\r\nsuggesting such pleasing sentiments, adds another to the remarkable\r\nelements of interest belonging to the history of the Townsend-Bishop\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nThe descendants of Francis and Rebecca Nurse are numerous, and have\r\nhonorably perpetuated the name. Among them may be mentioned the Rev.\r\nPeter Nurse, a graduate of Harvard College in 1802, for some years\r\nlibrarian of that institution, an excellent scholar, and long\r\nuniversally respected as a clergyman; and Amos Nurse, a graduate of the\r\nsame college in 1812,—an eminent physician connected with the medical\r\nfaculty of Bowdoin College, a man of distinguished talent and influence\r\nin public affairs, and senator in Congress from the State of Maine.\r\n\r\nThe Court met again on the 5th of August, and tried George Burroughs;\r\nJohn Procter and Elizabeth, his wife; George Jacobs, Sr.; John Willard;\r\nand Martha Carrier. They were all condemned, and, with the exception of\r\nElizabeth Procter, executed on the 19th of the same month.\r\n\r\nHutchinson describes the trial of Burroughs. After speaking of the\r\nevidence of the \"afflicted persons\" and the confessing witches, he\r\nmentions other circumstances which were thought to corroborate it: \"One\r\nwas, that, being a little man, he had performed feats beyond the\r\nstrength of a giant; viz., had held out a gun of seven feet barrel with\r\none hand, and had carried a barrel full of cider from a canoe to the\r\nshore.\" Bur[ii.297]roughs said that an Indian present at the time did\r\nthe same. Instantly, the accusers said it was \"the black man, or the\r\nDevil, who,\" they swore, \"looks like an Indian.\" Another piece of\r\nevidence was, that he went from one place to another, on a certain\r\noccasion, in a shorter time than was possible had not the Devil helped\r\nhim. He said, in answer, that another man accompanied him. Their reply\r\nto this was, that it was the Devil, using the appearance of another\r\nman. So whatever he said was turned against him. Hutchinson says, \"Upon\r\nthe whole, he was confounded, and used many twistings and turnings,\r\nwhich, I think, we cannot wonder at.\" This fair and judicious writer,\r\nlike Brattle, appears in the foregoing remark to have adopted the\r\ncommon scandal, put in circulation by parties interested to disparage\r\nMr. Burroughs. The papers in this case, that have come down to us, are\r\nmore numerous than in reference to many others among the sufferers; and\r\nthey do not bear such an impression. Mr. Burroughs was astounded at the\r\nmonstrous folly and falsehood with which he was surrounded. He was a\r\nman without guile, and incapable of appreciating such wickedness. He\r\ntried, in simplicity and ingenuousness, to explain what was brought\r\nagainst him; and this, probably, was all the \"twisting and turning\" he\r\nexhibited.\r\n\r\nHutchinson had the benefit of consulting all the papers belonging to\r\nthis and other trials; but neither he nor Calef seems to have noticed\r\none remarkable fact: many of the depositions, how many we\r\ncannot[ii.298] tell, were procured after the trials were over, and\r\nsurreptitiously foisted in among the papers to bolster up the\r\nproceedings. We find, for instance, the following deposition:—\r\n\r\n\"Thomas Greenslitt, aged about forty years, being deposed, testifieth\r\nthat, about the first breaking-out of this last Indian war, being at\r\nthe house of Captain Joshua Scotto at Black Point, he saw Mr. George\r\nBurrows, who was lately executed at Salem, lift a gun of six-foot\r\nbarrel or thereabouts, putting the forefinger of his right hand into\r\nthe muzzle of said gun, and that he held it out at arms' end, only with\r\nthat finger: and further this deponent testifieth, that, at the same\r\ntime, he saw the said Burrows take up a full barrel of molasses with\r\nbut two of the fingers of one of his hands in the bung, and carry it\r\nfrom the stage head to the door at the end of the stage, without\r\nletting it down; and that Lieutenant Richard Hunniwell and John\r\nGreenslitt were then present, and some others that are dead. Sept. 15,\r\n'92.\"\r\n\r\nNot only the date to this deposition, but its express language, proves\r\nthat it could not have been used at the trial. There is another, to the\r\nsame effect and of the same date, that is, nearly a month after\r\nBurroughs was thrown into his grave. There are others of the same kind.\r\nThis stamps the management of the prosecutions, and of those concerned\r\nin the charge of the papers, with an irregularity of the grossest kind,\r\nwhich partakes strongly of the character of fraud and falsehood.\r\n\r\nWhen it was found that there was beginning to grow up a want of\r\nconfidence in \"spectre evidence\" and the testimony of the afflicted\r\nchildren, those con[ii.299]cerned in the prosecutions became alarmed\r\nlest a re-action of public sentiment might take place. The persons who\r\nhad brought Mr. Burroughs to his death concluded that their best escape\r\nfrom public indignation was to accumulate evidence against him after he\r\nwas in his grave, particularly on the point of his superhuman strength;\r\nand they got up these depositions, and caused them to be put among the\r\npapers on file. Great stress was laid, by those who were interested in\r\ndamaging his character and suppressing sympathy in his fate, upon this\r\nparticular proof of his having been in confederacy with the Devil.\r\nIncrease Mather said, that, in his judgment, it was conclusive evidence\r\nthat he \"had the Devil to be his familiar,\" and that, had he been on\r\nthe jury, he could not, on this account, have concurred in a verdict of\r\nacquittal; and Cotton Mather, feeling the importance of making the most\r\nof Mr. Burroughs's extraordinary strength, gives way to his tendency to\r\nindulge in the marvellous, as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"God had been pleased so to leave this George Burroughs, that he had\r\nensnared himself by several instances which he had formerly given of\r\npreternatural strength, and which were now produced against him. He was\r\na very puny man, yet he had often done things beyond the strength of a\r\ngiant. A gun of about seven-foot barrel, and so heavy that strong men\r\ncould not steadily hold it out with both hands,—there were several\r\ntestimonies given in by persons of credit and honor, that he made\r\nnothing of taking up such a gun behind the lock with but one hand, and\r\nholding it out, like a pistol, at arms' end. Yea, there were\r\ntwo[ii.300] testimonies, that George Burroughs, with only putting the\r\nforefinger of his right hand into the muzzle of a heavy gun, a\r\nfowling-piece of about six or seven foot barrel, did lift up the gun,\r\nand hold it out at arms' end,—a gun which the deponents thought strong\r\nmen could not with both hands lift up, and hold at the butt end, as is\r\nusual.\"\r\n\r\nIt is further observable, in reference to the foregoing deposition from\r\nGreenslitt, that it was given six days after the condemnation of his\r\nmother, Ann Pudeator, and a week before her execution. Cotton Mather\r\nsays that he \"was overpersuaded by others to be out of the way upon\r\nGeorge Burroughs's trial,\" six weeks before. He did not fail, however,\r\nto come to Salem to be with his mother at her trial and until her\r\ndeath, and being here was compelled to give his deposition. His\r\nmother's life was at the mercy of the prosecutors; and he was tempted,\r\nin the vain hope of conciliating that mercy, to gratify them by making\r\nthe statement about Burroughs a month after his execution, and whom it\r\ncould not then harm. What he said was probably no more than the truth.\r\nIt has been found that the power of the human muscles can be cultivated\r\nto a surprising extent; and the feats ascribed to Burroughs, without\r\nmaking much allowance for a natural degree of exaggeration, have been\r\nfully equalled in our day.\r\n\r\nCalef gives the following account of his execution:—\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Burroughs was carried in a cart with the others, through the\r\nstreets of Salem, to execution. When he was upon the ladder, he made a\r\nspeech for the clearing of his[ii.301] innocency, with such solemn and\r\nserious expressions as were to the admiration of all present. His\r\nprayer (which he concluded by repeating the Lord's Prayer) was so well\r\nworded, and uttered with such composedness and such (at least seeming)\r\nfervency of spirit, as was very affecting, and drew tears from many, so\r\nthat it seemed to some that the spectators would hinder the execution.\r\nThe accusers said the black man stood and dictated to him. As soon as\r\nhe was turned off, Mr. Cotton Mather, being mounted upon a horse,\r\naddressed himself to the people, partly to declare that he (Mr.\r\nBurroughs) was no ordained minister, and partly to possess the people\r\nof his guilt, saying that the Devil often had been transformed into an\r\nangel of light; and this somewhat appeased the people, and the\r\nexecutions went on. When he was cut down, he was dragged by a halter to\r\na hole, or grave, between the rocks, about two feet deep; his shirt and\r\nbreeches being pulled off, and an old pair of trousers of one executed\r\nput on his lower parts: he was so put in, together with Willard and\r\nCarrier, that one of his hands, and his chin, and a foot of one of\r\nthem, was left uncovered.\"\r\n\r\nCotton Mather, not satisfied with this display of animosity, at a\r\nmoment when every human heart, however imbittered by prejudice, is\r\nhushed for the time in solemn silence, attempts, in an account\r\nafterwards given of Mr. Burroughs's trial, to blacken his character by\r\nan elaborate dressing-up of the absurd stories told by the accusers,\r\nand a perverse misrepresentation of the demeanor of the accused. He\r\nrelates with apparent glee what was regarded as a wonderful achievement\r\nof adroitness on the part of Chief-justice Stoughton in trapping Mr.\r\nBurroughs, and putting the laugh upon him in Court.[ii.302]\r\n\r\n\"It cost the Court a wonderful deal of trouble to hear the testimonies\r\nof the sufferers; for, when they were going to give in their\r\ndepositions, they would for a long while be taken with fits, that made\r\nthem quite uncapable of saying any thing. The chief judge asked the\r\nprisoner, who he thought hindered these witnesses from giving their\r\ntestimonies; and he answered, he supposed it was the Devil. The\r\nhonorable person then replied, 'How comes the Devil so loath to have\r\nany testimony borne against you?' Which cast him into very great\r\nconfusion.\"\r\n\r\nFrom what fell from him, at the preliminary examination, it is evident\r\nthat it did not occur to him as a possibility that human nature could\r\nbe capable of the guilt of such a wilful fabrication and imposture on\r\nthe part of the \"afflicted children.\" He beheld their sufferings, and\r\nhe knew his own innocence. He felt, whatever his theological creed\r\nmight have been, that a Devil was required to explain the mystery. The\r\napparent sufferings of the accusing witnesses convinced Court, jury,\r\nand all, of the guilt of the accused. The logic of the chief-justice\r\nwas perfectly absurd. For, if the Devil caused the sufferings, he was\r\nan adverse party to the prisoner. This, however, overthrows the whole\r\ntheory of the prosecution, which was that the prisoner and the Devil\r\nwere in league with each other. But the judge, jury, and people, all\r\nequally blinded and stupefied by the delusion, did not see it; and they\r\nchuckled over the alleged confusion of the prisoner. All thoughtful\r\npersons will concur in Mr. Burroughs's opinion, that, if ever a\r\ndiabolical power had possession[ii.303] of human beings, it was in the\r\ncase of the wretched creatures who enacted the part of the accusing\r\ngirls in the witchcraft proceedings. In his account of the trial,\r\nMather makes statements which show that he was privy to the fact, that\r\ntestimony, subsequently taken, was lodged with the evidence belonging\r\nto the case. The documents prove that it was done to an extent beyond\r\nwhat he acknowledges.\r\n\r\nConsidering that none dared to show the least sympathy with the persons\r\non trial, that they had none to counsel or stand by them, that the\r\npublic passions were incensed against them as against no other persons\r\never charged with crime,—it being vastly more flagrant than any other\r\ncrime, a rebellion against heaven and earth, God and man; a deliberate\r\nselling of the soul to the Arch-enemy of souls for the ruin of all\r\nother souls,—in view of all these things, it is truly astonishing,\r\nthat, by the documents themselves, proceeding, as in almost all cases\r\nthey do, from hostile and imbittered sources, we are compelled to the\r\nconviction, that, in their imprisonments, trials, and deaths, the\r\nvictims of this savage delusion manifested—in most cases eminently, and\r\nin all substantially—the marks, not only of innocent, but of elevated\r\nand heroic minds. A review of what can be gleaned in reference to Mr.\r\nBurroughs at Casco Bay and Salem Village, and a considerate survey and\r\nscrutiny of all that has reached us from the day of his arrest to the\r\nmoment of his death, have left a decided impression, that he was an\r\nable, intelligent, true-minded man; ingenuous,[ii.304] sincere, humble\r\nin his spirit; faithful and devoted as a minister; and active,\r\ngenerous, and disinterested as a citizen. His descendants, under his\r\nown name and the names of Newman, Fowle, Holbrook, Fox, Thomas, and\r\nothers, have been numerous and respectable. The late Isaiah Thomas,\r\nLL.D., was one of them.\r\n\r\nFrom the account given of John Procter, in the First Part, it is\r\napparent that he was a person of decided character, and, although\r\nimpulsive and liable to be imprudent, of a manly spirit, honest,\r\nearnest, and bold in word and deed. He saw through the whole thing, and\r\nwas convinced that it was the result of a conspiracy, deliberate and\r\ncriminal, on the part of the accusers. He gave free utterance to his\r\nindignation at their conduct, and it cost him his life.\r\n\r\nA few days before his trial, he made his will. There is no reference in\r\nit to his particular situation. His signature to the document is\r\naccurately represented among the autographs given in this work. It was\r\nwritten while the manacles were on him. Notwithstanding the danger to\r\nwhich any one was exposed who expressed sympathy for convicted or\r\naccused persons, or doubt of their guilt, a large number had the\r\nmanliness to try to save this worthy and honest citizen. John Wise, one\r\nof the ministers of Ipswich, heads the list of petitioners from that\r\nplace. The document is in his handwriting. Thirty-one others joined in\r\nthe act, many of them among the most respectable citizens of that town.\r\nMr. Wise was a learned, able, and enlightened man. He had a free\r\nspirit, and was per[ii.305]haps the only minister in the neighborhood\r\nor country, who was discerning enough to see the erroneousness of the\r\nproceedings from the beginning. The petition is as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"_The Humble and Sincere Declaration of us, Subscribers, Inhabitants in\r\nIpswich, on the Behalf of our Neighbors, John Procter and his Wife, now\r\nin Trouble and under Suspicion of Witchcraft._\r\n\r\n\"TO THE HONORABLE COURT OF ASSISTANTS NOW SITTING IN BOSTON.\r\n\r\n\"_Honored and Right Worshipful_,—The aforesaid John Procter may have\r\ngreat reason to justify the Divine Sovereignty of God under these\r\nsevere remarks of Providence upon his peace and honor, under a due\r\nreflection upon his life past; and so the best of us have reason to\r\nadore the great pity and indulgence of God's providence, that we are\r\nnot exposed to the utmost shame that the Devil can invent, under the\r\npermissions of sovereignty, though not for that sin forenamed, yet for\r\nour many transgressions. For we do at present suppose, that it may be a\r\nmethod within the severer but just transactions of the infinite majesty\r\nof God, that he sometimes may permit Sathan to personate, dissemble,\r\nand thereby abuse innocents and such as do, in the fear of God, defy\r\nthe Devil and all his works. The great rage he is permitted to attempt\r\nholy Job with; the abuse he does the famous Samuel in disquieting his\r\nsilent dust, by shadowing his venerable person in answer to the charms\r\nof witchcraft; and other instances from good hands,—may be arguments.\r\nBesides the unsearchable footsteps of God's judgments, that are brought\r\nto light every morning, that as[ii.306]tonish our weaker reasons; to\r\nteach us adoration, trembling, dependence, &c. But we must not trouble\r\nYour Honors by being tedious. Therefore, being smitten with the notice\r\nof what hath happened, we reckon it within the duties of our charity,\r\nthat teacheth us to do as we would be done by, to offer thus much for\r\nthe clearing of our neighbors' innocency; viz., that we never had the\r\nleast knowledge of such a nefandous wickedness in our said neighbors,\r\nsince they have been within our acquaintance. Neither do we remember\r\nany such thoughts in us concerning them, or any action by them or\r\neither of them, directly tending that way, no more than might be in the\r\nlives of any other persons of the clearest reputation as to any such\r\nevils. What God may have left them to, we cannot go into God's pavilion\r\nclothed with clouds of darkness round about; but, as to what we have\r\never seen or heard of them, upon our consciences we judge them innocent\r\nof the crime objected. His breeding hath been amongst us, and was of\r\nreligious parents in our place, and, by reason of relations and\r\nproperties within our town, hath had constant intercourse with us. We\r\nspeak upon our personal acquaintance and observation; and so leave our\r\nneighbors, and this our testimony on their behalf, to the wise thoughts\r\nof Your Honors.\r\n\r\nJno. Wise.

It is due to their memory; and their descendants may well\r\nbe gratified by the testimony thus borne to their courage and justice.\r\n\r\nTheir neighbors living near the bounds of the village presented the\r\nfollowing paper, in the handwriting of Felton, the first signer. From\r\nthe appearance of the document, it seems that a portion of it, probably\r\ncontaining an equal number of names, has been cut out by scissors.\r\n\r\n\"We whose names are underwritten, having several years known John\r\nProcter and his wife, do testify that we never heard or understood that\r\nthey were ever suspected to be guilty of the crime now charged upon\r\nthem; and several of us, being their near neighbors, do testify, that,\r\nto our apprehension, they lived Christian-like in their family, and\r\nwere ever ready to help such as stood in need of their help.\r\n\r\n\"Nathaniel Felton, Sr., and Mary his wife.\r\nSamuel Marsh, and Priscilla his wife.\r\nJames Houlton, and Ruth his wife.\r\nJohn Felton.\r\nNathaniel Felton, Jr.\r\nSamuel Frayll, and An his wife.\r\nZachariah Marsh, and Mary his wife.\r\nSamuel Endecott, and Hanah his wife.\r\nSamuel Stone.\r\nGeorge Locker.\r\nSamuel Gaskil, and Provided his wife.\r\nGeorge Smith.\r\nEdward Gaskil.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to this testimony in their favor, evidence was offered, at\r\ntheir trial, that one of the accusing[ii.308] witnesses had denied, out\r\nof Court, what she had sworn to in Court; and declared that she must,\r\nat the time, have been \"out of her head,\" and that she had never\r\nintended to accuse them. It was further proved, that another of the\r\naccusing witnesses acknowledged that she had sworn falsely, and tried\r\nto explain away her testimony in Court, acknowledging that what the\r\ngirls said was \"for sport. They must have some sport.\" But neither the\r\ntestimony in their favor from those who had known them through life,\r\nnor the palpable and decisive manner in which the evidence against them\r\nhad been impeached and exposed, could open the eyes of the infatuated\r\nCourt and jury.\r\n\r\nAfter his conviction, he requested, in vain, time enough to prepare\r\nhimself for death, and make the necessary arrangements of his business\r\nand for the welfare of his family; and the statement has come down to\r\nus, that Mr. Noyes refused to pray with him, unless he would confess\r\nhimself guilty. The following letter, addressed by him to the ministers\r\nnamed, in behalf of himself and fellow-prisoners, gives a truly\r\nshocking account of the outrages connected with the prosecutions. It\r\nillustrates the courage of the writer in exposing them, and is a\r\nsensible and manly appeal and remonstrance. There is ground for\r\nsupposing that the ministers addressed were known not to be entirely\r\ncarried away by the delusion. The fact that Mr. Mather—meaning, of\r\ncourse, Increase Mather—is the first named, corroborates other evidence\r\nthat he was beginning to entertain doubts about the propriety[ii.309]\r\nof the proceedings. Of the Rev. James Allen, much has been said in\r\nconnection with the Townsend-Bishop farm. He had been a clergyman in\r\nEngland, and was silenced by the Act of Uniformity, in 1662. He came to\r\nNew England; and, after officiating as an assistant to the Rev. Mr.\r\nDavenport, in the First Church at Boston, for six years, was ordained\r\nas its preacher in 1668. He was of independent fortune, and\r\nsubsequently took a leading part with those opposed to the party that\r\nhad favored the witchcraft prosecutions. He must have known Rebecca\r\nNurse quite intimately, and much of the influence used in her favor,\r\nand which almost saved her, may be attributed to him; there was a\r\nparticular intimacy between him and Increase Mather, and together they\r\nheld Cotton Mather somewhat in check, occasionally at least. The Rev.\r\nJoshua Moody had been settled in the ministry at Portsmouth, New\r\nHampshire. In the maintenance of the principles of religious liberty he\r\nsuffered a long imprisonment, and was afterwards exiled by arbitrary\r\npower. He was then invited to the First Church in Boston, where he\r\npreached from 1684 to 1693, when he returned to Portsmouth. He died in\r\n1697. By his active exertions, Mr. and Mrs. English were enabled to\r\nescape from the jail at Boston. The Rev. Samuel Willard, pastor of the\r\nOld South Church in Boston, was one of the most revered and beloved\r\nministers in the country. His publications were numerous, learned, and\r\nvaluable; consisting of discourses, tracts, and volumes. His \"Body of\r\nDivinity\" is an elaborate and systematic[ii.310] work, comprising two\r\nhundred and fifty lectures on the Assembly's Catechism. That Procter\r\nwas not in error in supposing Mr. Willard open to reason on the subject\r\nis demonstrated by the fact, that the \"afflicted girls\" were beginning\r\nto cry out against this eminent divine. The Rev. John Bailey was one of\r\nthe ejected ministers who had here sought refuge from oppression in the\r\nmother-country. He was a distinguished person, associated with Mr.\r\nAllen and Mr. Moody in the ministry of the First Church at Boston.\r\nCotton Mather made him the subject of the strongest eulogium in his\r\n\"Magnalia.\" Procter addressed his letter to these persons because he\r\nbelieved them to be superior in wisdom and candid in spirit. It cannot\r\nbe doubted that the good men did what they could in his behalf, but in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\n\"Salem Prison, July 23, 1692.\r\n\r\n\"_Mr. Mather, Mr. Allen, Mr. Moody, Mr. Willard, and Mr. Bailey._\r\n\r\n\"Reverend Gentlemen,—The innocency of our case, with the enmity of our\r\naccusers and our judges and jury, whom nothing but our innocent blood\r\nwill serve, having condemned us already before our trials, being so\r\nmuch incensed and enraged against us by the Devil, makes us bold to beg\r\nand implore your favorable assistance of this our humble petition to\r\nHis Excellency, that if it be possible our innocent blood may be\r\nspared, which undoubtedly otherwise will be shed, if the Lord doth not\r\nmercifully step in; the magistrates, ministers, juries, and all the\r\npeople in general, being[ii.311] so much enraged and incensed against\r\nus by the delusion of the Devil, which we can term no other, by reason\r\nwe know, in our own consciences, we are all innocent persons. Here are\r\nfive persons who have lately confessed themselves to be witches, and do\r\naccuse some of us of being along with them at a sacrament, since we\r\nwere committed into close prison, which we know to be lies. Two of the\r\nfive are (Carrier's sons) young men, who would not confess any thing\r\ntill they tied them neck and heels, till the blood was ready to come\r\nout of their noses; and it is credibly believed and reported this was\r\nthe occasion of making them confess what they never did, by reason they\r\nsaid one had been a witch a month, and another five weeks, and that\r\ntheir mother made them so, who has been confined here this nine weeks.\r\nMy son, William Procter, when he was examined, because he would not\r\nconfess that he was guilty, when he was innocent, they tied him neck\r\nand heels till the blood gushed out at his nose, and would have kept\r\nhim so twenty-four hours, if one, more merciful than the rest, had not\r\ntaken pity on him, and caused him to be unbound.\r\n\r\n\"These actions are very like the Popish cruelties. They have already\r\nundone us in our estates, and that will not serve their turns without\r\nour innocent blood. If it cannot be granted that we can have our trials\r\nat Boston, we humbly beg that you would endeavor to have these\r\nmagistrates changed, and others in their room; begging also and\r\nbeseeching you, that you would be pleased to be here, if not all, some\r\nof you, at our trials, hoping thereby you may be the means of saving\r\nthe shedding of our innocent blood. Desiring your prayers to the Lord\r\nin our behalf, we rest, your poor afflicted servants,\r\n\r\n\"John Procter [and others].\" [ii.312]\r\n\r\nThe bitterness of the prosecutors against Procter was so vehement, that\r\nthey not only arrested, and tried to destroy, his wife and all his\r\nfamily above the age of infancy, in Salem, but all her relatives in\r\nLynn, many of whom were thrown into prison. The helpless children were\r\nleft destitute, and the house swept of its provisions by the sheriff.\r\nProcter's wife gave birth to a child, about a fortnight after his\r\nexecution. This indicates to what alone she owed her life.\r\n\r\nJohn Procter had spoken so boldly against the proceedings, and all who\r\nhad part in them, that it was felt to be necessary to put him out of\r\nthe way. He had denounced the entire company of the accusers, and their\r\nrevenge demanded his sacrifice. They brought the whole power of their\r\ncunning and audacious arts to bear against him, and pursued him to the\r\ndeath with violence and rage. The manly and noble deportment exhibited\r\nin his dying hour seems to have made a deep impression on the minds of\r\nsome, and gave an effectual blow to the delusion. The descendants of\r\nJohn Procter have always understood that his remains were recovered\r\nfrom the spot where the hangman deposited them, and placed in his own\r\ngrounds, where they rest to-day.\r\n\r\n[ii.313]\r\n\r\nsignatures\r\n\r\n[ii.314]\r\n\r\nsignatures\r\n\r\nNo account has come to us of the deportment of George Jacobs, Sr., at\r\nhis execution. As he was remarkable in life for the firmness of his\r\nmind, so he probably was in death. He had made his will before the\r\ndelusion arose. It is dated Jan. 29, 1692; and shows that he, like\r\nProcter, had a considerable estate.[ii.315] Bartholomew Gedney is one\r\nof the attesting witnesses, and probably wrote the document. After his\r\nconviction, on the 12th of August, he caused another to be written,\r\nwhich, in its provisions, reflects light upon the state of mind\r\nproduced by the condition in which he found himself. In his infirm old\r\nage, he had been condemned to die for a crime of which he knew himself\r\ninnocent, and which there is some reason to believe he did not think\r\nany one capable of committing. He regarded the whole thing as a wicked\r\nconspiracy and absurd fabrication. He had to end his long life upon a\r\nscaffold in a week from that day. His house was desolated, and his\r\nproperty sequestered. His only son, charged with the same crime, had\r\neluded the sheriff,—leaving his family, in the hurry of his flight,\r\nunprovided for—and was an exile in foreign lands. The crazy wife of\r\nthat son was in prison and in chains, waiting trial on the same charge;\r\nher little children, including an unweaned infant, left in a deserted\r\nand destitute condition in the woods. The older children were\r\nscattered, he knew not where, while one of them had completed the\r\nbitterness of his lot by becoming a confessor, upon being arrested with\r\nher mother as a witch. This grand-daughter, Margaret, overwhelmed with\r\nfright and horror, bewildered by the statements of the accusers, and\r\ncontrolled probably by the arguments and arbitrary methods of address\r\nemployed by her minister, Mr. Noyes,—whose peculiar function in these\r\nproceedings seems to have been to drive persons accused to make\r\nconfession—had been betrayed into[ii.316] that position, and became a\r\nconfessor, and accuser of others. Under these circumstances, the old\r\nman made a will, giving to his son George his estates, and securing the\r\nsuccession of them to his male descendants. But, in the mean while,\r\nwithout his then knowing it, Margaret had recalled her confession, as\r\nappears from the following documents, which tell their own story:—\r\n\r\n\"_The Humble Declaration of Margaret Jacobs unto the Honored Court now\r\nsitting at Salem showeth_, that, whereas your poor and humble\r\ndeclarant, being closely confined here in Salem jail for the crime of\r\nwitchcraft,—which crime, thanks be to the Lord! I am altogether\r\nignorant of, as will appear at the great day of judgment,—may it please\r\nthe honored Court, I was cried out upon by some of the possessed\r\npersons as afflicting them; whereupon I was brought to my examination;\r\nwhich persons at the sight of me fell down, which did very much startle\r\nand affright me. The Lord above knows I knew nothing in the least\r\nmeasure how or who afflicted them. They told me, without doubt I did,\r\nor else they would not fall down at me; they told me, if I would not\r\nconfess, I should be put down into the dungeon, and would be hanged,\r\nbut, if I would confess, I should have my life: the which did so\r\naffright me, with my own vile, wicked heart, to save my life, made me\r\nmake the like confession I did, which confession, may it please the\r\nhonored Court, is altogether false and untrue. The very first night\r\nafter I had made confession, I was in such horror of conscience that I\r\ncould not sleep, for fear the Devil should carry me away for telling\r\nsuch horrid lies. I was, may it please the honored Court, sworn to my\r\nconfession, as I understand[ii.317] since; but then, at that time, was\r\nignorant of it, not knowing what an oath did mean. The Lord, I hope, in\r\nwhom I trust, out of the abundance of his mercy, will forgive me my\r\nfalse forswearing myself. What I said was altogether false against my\r\ngrandfather and Mr. Burroughs, which I did to save my life, and to have\r\nmy liberty: but the Lord, charging it to my conscience, made me in so\r\nmuch horror, that I could not contain myself before I had denied my\r\nconfession, which I did, though I saw nothing but death before me;\r\nchoosing rather death with a quiet conscience, than to live in such\r\nhorror, which I could not suffer. Where, upon my denying my confession,\r\nI was committed to close prison, where I have enjoyed more felicity in\r\nspirit, a thousand times, than I did before in my enlargement. And now,\r\nmay it please Your Honors, your declarant having in part given Your\r\nHonors a description of my condition, do leave it to Your Honors' pious\r\nand judicious discretions to take pity and compassion on my young and\r\ntender years, to act and do with me as the Lord above and Your Honors\r\nshall see good, having no friend but the Lord to plead my cause for me;\r\nnot being guilty, in the least measure, of the crime of witchcraft, nor\r\nany other sin that deserves death from man. And your poor and humble\r\ndeclarant shall for ever pray, as she is bound in duty, for Your\r\nHonors' happiness in this life, and eternal felicity in the world to\r\ncome. So prays Your Honors' declarant,\r\n\r\nMargaret Jacobs.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter was written by this same young person to her\r\nfather. Let it be observed that her grandfather had been executed the\r\nday before, partly upon her false testimony.[ii.318]\r\n\r\n\"_From the Dungeon in Salem Prison._\r\n\r\n\"August 20, 1692.\r\n\r\n\"Honored Father,—After my humble duty remembered to you, hoping in the\r\nLord of your good health, as, blessed be God! I enjoy, though in\r\nabundance of affliction, being close confined here in a loathsome\r\ndungeon: the Lord look down in mercy upon me, not knowing how soon I\r\nshall be put to death, by means of the afflicted persons; my\r\ngrandfather having suffered already, and all his estate seized for the\r\nking. The reason of my confinement is this: I having, through the\r\nmagistrates' threatenings, and my own vile and wretched heart,\r\nconfessed several things contrary to my conscience and knowledge,\r\nthough to the wounding of my own soul; (the Lord pardon me for it!)\r\nbut, oh! the terrors of a wounded conscience who can bear? But, blessed\r\nbe the Lord! he would not let me go on in my sins, but in mercy, I\r\nhope, to my soul, would not suffer me to keep it any longer: but I was\r\nforced to confess the truth of all before the magistrates, who would\r\nnot believe me; but it is their pleasure to put me in here, and God\r\nknows how soon I shall be put to death. Dear father, let me beg your\r\nprayers to the Lord on my behalf, and send us a joyful and happy\r\nmeeting in heaven. My mother, poor woman, is very crazy, and remembers\r\nher kind love to you, and to uncle; viz., D.A. So, leaving you to the\r\nprotection of the Lord, I rest, your dutiful daughter,\r\n\r\nMargaret Jacobs.\"\r\n\r\nA temporary illness led to the postponement of her trial; and, before\r\nthe next sitting of the Court, the delusion had passed away.\r\n\r\nThe \"uncle D.A.,\" referred to, was Daniel Andrew, their nearest\r\nneighbor, who had escaped at the[ii.319] same time with her father. She\r\ncalls him \"uncle.\" He was, it is probable, a brother of John Andrew who\r\nhad married Ann Jacobs, sister of her father. Words of relationship\r\nwere then used with a wide sense.\r\n\r\nMargaret read the recantation of her confession before the Court, and\r\nwas, as she says, forthwith ordered by them into a dungeon. She\r\nobtained permission to visit Mr. Burroughs the day before his\r\nexecution, acknowledged that she had belied him, and implored his\r\nforgiveness. He freely forgave, and prayed with her and for her. It is\r\nprobable, that, at the same time, she obtained an interview with her\r\ngrandfather for the same purpose. At any rate, the old man heard of her\r\nheroic conduct, and forthwith crowded into the space between two\r\nparagraphs in his will, in small letters closely written (the jailer\r\nprobably being the amanuensis), a clause giving a legacy of \"ten pounds\r\nto be paid in silver\" to his grand-daughter, Margaret Jacobs. There is\r\nthe usual declaration, that it \"was inserted before sealing and\r\nsigning.\" This will having been made after conviction and sentence to\r\ndeath, and having but two witnesses, one besides the jailer, was not\r\nallowed in Probate, but remains among the files of that Court. As a\r\nlink in the foregoing story, it is an interesting relic. The legacy\r\nclause, although not operative, was no doubt of inexpressible value to\r\nthe feelings of Margaret: and the circumstance seems to have touched\r\nthe heart even of the General Court, nearly twenty years afterwards;\r\nfor they took pains specifically to[ii.320] provide to have the same\r\nsum paid to Margaret, out of the Province treasury.\r\n\r\nShe was not tried at the time appointed, in consequence, it is stated,\r\nof \"an imposthume in the head,\" and finally escaped the fate to which\r\nshe chose to consign herself, rather than remain under a violated\r\nconscience. In judging of her, we cannot fail to make allowance for her\r\n\"young and tender years,\" and to sympathize in the sufferings through\r\nwhich she passed. In making confession, and in accusing others, she had\r\ndone that which filled her heart with horror, in the retrospect, so\r\nlong as she lived. In recanting it, and giving her body to the dungeon,\r\nand offering her life at the scaffold, she had secured the forgiveness\r\nof Mr. Burroughs and her aged grandfather, and deserves our forgiveness\r\nand admiration. Every human heart must rejoice that this young girl was\r\nsaved. She lived to be a worthy matron and the founder of a numerous\r\nand respectable family.\r\n\r\nGeorge Jacobs, Sr., is the only one, among the victims of the\r\nwitchcraft prosecutions, the precise spot of whose burial is absolutely\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Jacobs House\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JACOBS HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tradition has descended through the family, that the body, after\r\nhaving been obtained at the place of execution, was strapped by a young\r\ngrandson on the back of a horse, brought home to the farm, and buried\r\nbeneath the shade of his own trees. Two sunken and weather-worn stones\r\nmarked the spot. There the remains rested until 1864, when they were\r\nexhumed. They were enclosed again, and reverently redeposited[ii.321]\r\nin the same place. The skull was in a state of considerable\r\npreservation. An examination of the jawbones showed that he was a very\r\nold man at the time of his death, and had previously lost all his\r\nteeth. The length of some parts of the skeleton showed that he was a\r\nvery tall man. These circumstances corresponded with the evidence,\r\nwhich was that he was tall of stature; so infirm as to walk with two\r\nstaffs; with long, flowing white hair. The only article found, except\r\nthe bones, was a metallic pin, which might have been used as a\r\nbreastpin, or to hold together his aged locks. It is an observable\r\nfact, that he rests in his own ground still. He had lived for a great\r\nlength of time on that spot; and it remains in his family and in his\r\nname to this day, having come down by direct descent. It is a beautiful\r\nlocality: the land descends with a gradual and smooth declivity to the\r\nbank of the river. It is not much more than a mile from the city of\r\nSalem, and in full view from the main road.\r\n\r\nJohn Willard appears to have been an honest and amiable person, an\r\nindustrious farmer, having a comfortable estate, with a wife and three\r\nyoung children. He was a grandson of Old Bray Wilkins; whether by blood\r\nor marriage, I have not been able to ascertain. The indications are\r\nthat he married a daughter of Thomas or Henry Wilkins, most probably\r\nthe former, with both of whom he was a joint possessor of lands. He\r\ncame from Groton; and it is for local antiquaries to discover whether\r\nhe was a relative of the Rev. Samuel Willard of Boston. If so, the fact\r\nwould[ii.322] shed much light upon our story. There is but one piece of\r\nevidence among the papers relating to his trial that deserves\r\nparticular notice. It shows the horrid character of the charges made by\r\nthe girls against prisoners at the bar, from their nature incapable of\r\nbeing refuted and which the prisoners knew to be false, but the Court,\r\njury, and crowd implicitly believed. It also illustrates the\r\ncompleteness of the machinery got up by the \"accusing girls\" to give\r\neffect to their evidence. In addition to the evil gossip that could be\r\nscoured from all the country round, and to spectres of witches and\r\nghosts of the dead, they brought into the scene angels and divine\r\nbeings, and testified to what they were told by them. \"The shining\r\nman,\" or the white man, was meant, in the following deposition, to be a\r\nspirit of this description:—\r\n\r\n\"The Testimony of Susanna Sheldon, aged eighteen years or\r\nthereabouts.—Testifieth and saith, that, the day of the date hereof\r\n(9th of May, 1692), I saw at Nathaniel Ingersoll's house the\r\napparitions of these four persons,—William Shaw's first wife, the Widow\r\nCook, Goodman Jones and his child; and among these came the apparition\r\nof John Willard, to whom these four said, 'You have murdered us.' These\r\nfour having said thus to Willard, they turned as red as blood. And,\r\nturning about to look at me, they turned as pale as death. These four\r\ndesired me to tell Mr. Hathorne. Willard, hearing them, pulled out a\r\nknife, saying, if I did, he would cut my throat.\"\r\n\r\nThe deponent goes on to say, that these several apparitions came before\r\nher on another occasion, and the same language and actions took place,\r\nand adds:[ii.323]—\r\n\r\n\"There did appear to me a shining man, who said I should go and tell\r\nwhat I had heard and seen to Mr. Hathorne. This Willard, being there\r\npresent, told me, if I did, he would cut my throat. At this time and\r\nplace, this shining man told me, that if I did go to tell this to Mr.\r\nHathorne, that I should be well, going and coming, but I should be\r\nafflicted there. Then said I to the shining man, 'Hunt Willard away,\r\nand I would believe what he said, that he might not choke me.' With\r\nthat the shining man held up his hand, and Willard vanished away. About\r\ntwo hours after, the same appeared to me again, and the said Willard\r\nwith them; and I asked them where their wounds were, and they said\r\nthere would come an angel from heaven, and would show them. And\r\nforthwith the angel came. I asked what the man's name was that appeared\r\nto me last, and the angel told his name was Southwick. And the angel\r\nlifted up his winding-sheet, and out of his left side he pulled a\r\npitchfork tine, and put it in again, and likewise he opened all the\r\nwinding-sheets, and showed all their wounds. And the white man told me\r\nto tell Mr. Hathorne of it, and I told him to hunt Willard away, and I\r\nwould; and he held up his hand, and he vanished away.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same deposition, this girl testifies that \"she saw this Willard\r\nsuckle the apparitions of two black pigs on his breasts;\" that Willard\r\ntold her he had been a witch twenty years; that she saw Willard and\r\nother wizards kneel in prayer \"to the black man with a long-crowned\r\nhat, and then they vanished away.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the kind of testimony which the Court received with awe-struck\r\nand bewildered credulity,[ii.324] and which took away the lives of\r\nvaluable and blameless men. All we know of the manner of Willard's\r\ndeath is a passage from Brattle, who states that a deep impression was\r\nproduced by the admirable deportment of the sufferers during the awful\r\nscenes before and at their executions; giving every evidence of\r\nconscious innocence and a Christian character and faith, on the part\r\nespecially of \"Procter and Willard, whose whole management of\r\nthemselves from the jail to the gallows, and whilst at the gallows, was\r\nvery affecting, and melting to the hearts of some considerable\r\nspectators whom I could mention to you: but they are executed, and so I\r\nleave them.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of September, the Court met again; and _Martha Corey_, _Mary\r\nEasty_, _Alice Parker_, _Ann Pudeator_, Dorcas Hoar, and Mary Bradbury\r\nwere tried and condemned; and, on the 17th, _Margaret Scott_, _Wilmot\r\nReed_, _Samuel Wardwell_, _Mary Parker_, Abigail Faulkner, Rebecca\r\nEames, Mary Lacy, Ann Foster, and Abigail Hobbs received the same\r\nsentence. Those in Italics were executed Sept. 22, 1692. Of the\r\ncircumstances in relation to them, in reference to their death and at\r\nthe time of their execution, but little information has reached us. The\r\nfollowing extract from Mr. Parris's church-records presents a striking\r\npicture:—\r\n\r\n\"11 September, Lord's Day.—Sister Martha Corey—taken into the church 27\r\nApril, 1690—was, after examination upon suspicion of witchcraft, 27\r\nMarch, 1692, committed to prison for that fact, and was condemned to\r\nthe[ii.325] gallows for the same yesterday; and was this day in public,\r\nby a general consent, voted to be excommunicated out of the church, and\r\nLieutenant Nathaniel Putnam and the two deacons chosen to signify to\r\nher, with the pastor, the mind of the church herein. Accordingly, this\r\n14 September, 1692, the three aforesaid brethren went with the pastor\r\nto her in Salem Prison; whom we found very obdurate, justifying\r\nherself, and condemning all that had done any thing to her just\r\ndiscovery or condemnation. Whereupon, after a little discourse (for her\r\nimperiousness would not suffer much), and after prayer,—which she was\r\nwilling to decline,—the dreadful sentence of excommunication was\r\npronounced against her.\"\r\n\r\nCalef informs us, that \"Martha Corey, protesting her innocency,\r\nconcluded her life with an eminent prayer upon the ladder.\"\r\n\r\nNothing has reached us particularly relating to the manner of death of\r\nAlice or Mary Parker, Ann Pudeator, Margaret Scott, or Wilmot Reed.\r\nThey all asserted their innocence; and their deportment gave no ground\r\nfor any unfavorable comment by their persecutors, who were on the watch\r\nto turn every act, word, or look of the sufferers to their\r\ndisparagement. Wilmot Reed probably adhered to the unresisting demeanor\r\nwhich marked her examination. It was all a mystery to her; and to every\r\nquestion she answered, \"I know nothing about it.\" Of Mary Easty it is\r\ngrateful to have some account. Her own declarations in vindication of\r\nher innocence are fortunately preserved; and her noble record is\r\ncomplete in the fol[ii.326]lowing documents. The first appears to have\r\nbeen addressed to the Special Court, and was presented immediately\r\nbefore the trial of Mary Easty. No explanation has come down to us why\r\nSarah Cloyse was not then also brought to trial. Circumstances to which\r\nwe have no clew rescued her from the fate of her sisters.\r\n\r\n\"_The Humble Request of Mary Easty and Sarah Cloyse to the Honored\r\nCourt humbly showeth_, that, whereas we two sisters, Mary Easty and\r\nSarah Cloyse, stand now before the honored Court charged with the\r\nsuspicion of witchcraft, our humble request is—First, that, seeing we\r\nare neither able to plead our own cause, nor is counsel allowed to\r\nthose in our condition, that you who are our judges would please to be\r\nof counsel to us, to direct us wherein we may stand in need. Secondly,\r\nthat, whereas we are not conscious to ourselves of any guilt in the\r\nleast degree of that crime whereof we are now accused (in the presence\r\nof the living God we speak it, before whose awful tribunal we know we\r\nshall ere long appear), nor of any other scandalous evil or miscarriage\r\ninconsistent with Christianity, those who have had the longest and best\r\nknowledge of us, being persons of good report, may be suffered to\r\ntestify upon oath what they know concerning each of us; viz., Mr.\r\nCapen, the pastor, and those of the town and church of Topsfield, who\r\nare ready to say something which we hope may be looked upon as very\r\nconsiderable in this matter, with the seven children of one of us;\r\nviz., Mary Easty: and it may be produced of like nature in reference to\r\nthe wife of Peter Cloyse, her sister. Thirdly, that the testimony of\r\nwitches, or such as are afflicted as is supposed by witches, may not be\r\nimproved to[ii.327] condemn us without other legal evidence concurring.\r\nWe hope the honored Court and jury will be so tender of the lives of\r\nsuch as we are, who have for many years lived under the unblemished\r\nreputation of Christianity, as not to condemn them without a fair and\r\nequal hearing of what may be said for us as well as against us. And\r\nyour poor suppliants shall be bound always to pray, &c.\"\r\n\r\nThe following was presented by Mary Easty to the judges after she had\r\nreceived sentence of death. It would be hard to find, in all the\r\nrecords of human suffering and of Christian deportment under them, a\r\nmore affecting production. It is a most beautiful specimen of strong\r\ngood-sense, pious fortitude and faith, genuine dignity of soul, noble\r\nbenevolence, and the true eloquence of a pure heart; and was evidently\r\ncomposed by her own hand. It may be said of her—and there can be no\r\nhigher eulogium—that she felt for others more than for herself.\r\n\r\n\"_The Humble Petition of Mary Easty unto his Excellency Sir William\r\nPhips, and to the Honored Judge and Bench now sitting in Judicature in\r\nSalem, and the Reverend Ministers, humbly showeth_, that, whereas your\r\npoor and humble petitioner, being condemned to die, do humbly beg of\r\nyou to take it in your judicious and pious consideration, that your\r\npoor and humble petitioner, knowing my own innocency, blessed be the\r\nLord for it! and seeing plainly the wiles and subtilty of my accusers\r\nby myself, cannot but judge charitably of others that are going the\r\nsame way of myself, if the Lord steps not mightily in. I was confined a\r\nwhole month upon the same account that I am condemned[ii.328] now for,\r\nand then cleared by the afflicted persons, as some of Your Honors know.\r\nAnd in two days' time I was cried out upon them, and have been\r\nconfined, and now am condemned to die. The Lord above knows my\r\ninnocency then, and likewise does now, as at the great day will be\r\nknown to men and angels. I petition to Your Honors not for my own life,\r\nfor I know I must die, and my appointed time is set; but the Lord he\r\nknows it is that, if it be possible, no more innocent blood may be\r\nshed, which undoubtedly cannot be avoided in the way and course you go\r\nin. I question not but Your Honors do to the utmost of your powers in\r\nthe discovery and detecting of witchcraft and witches, and would not be\r\nguilty of innocent blood for the world. But, by my own innocency, I\r\nknow you are in the wrong way. The Lord in his infinite mercy direct\r\nyou in this great work, if it be his blessed will that no more innocent\r\nblood be shed! I would humbly beg of you, that Your Honors would be\r\npleased to examine these afflicted persons strictly, and keep them\r\napart some time, and likewise to try some of these confessing witches;\r\nI being confident there is several of them, has belied themselves and\r\nothers, as will appear, if not in this world, I am sure in the world to\r\ncome, whither I am now agoing. I question not but you will see an\r\nalteration of these things. They say myself and others having made a\r\nleague with the Devil, we cannot confess. I know, and the Lord knows,\r\nas will ... appear, they belie me, and so I question not but they do\r\nothers. The Lord above, who is the Searcher of all hearts, knows, as I\r\nshall answer it at the tribunal seat, that I know not the least thing\r\nof witchcraft; therefore I cannot, I dare not, belie my own soul. I beg\r\nYour Honors not to deny this my humble petition from a poor, dying,\r\ninnocent person. And I question not but the Lord will give a blessing\r\nto your endeavors.\" [ii.329]\r\n\r\nThe parting interview of this admirable woman with her husband,\r\nchildren, and friends, as she was about proceeding to the place of\r\nexecution, is said to have been a most solemn, affecting, and truly\r\nsublime scene. Calef says that her farewell communications, on this\r\noccasion, were reported, by persons who listened to them, to have been\r\n\"as serious, religious, distinct, and affectionate as could well be\r\nexpressed, drawing tears from the eyes of almost all present.\"\r\n\r\nAnn Pudeator had been formerly the wife of a person named Greenslitt,\r\nwho left her with five children. Her subsequent husband, Jacob\r\nPudeator, died in 1682, and by will gave her his whole estate, after\r\nthe payment of legacies, of five pounds each, to her Greenslitt\r\nchildren, who appear to have been living in 1692 at Casco Bay. These\r\nprovisions, as well as the expressions used by Pudeator, indicate that\r\nhe regarded her with affection and esteem. The following document is\r\nall that we know else of her character particularly, except that she\r\nwas a kind neighbor, and ever prompt in offices of charity and\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\n\"_The Humble Petition of Ann Pudeator unto the Honored Judge and Bench\r\nnow sitting in Judicature in Salem, humbly showeth_, that, whereas your\r\npoor and humble petitioner, being condemned to die, and knowing in my\r\nown conscience, as I shall shortly answer it before the great God of\r\nheaven, who is the Searcher and Knower of all hearts, that the evidence\r\nof Jno. Best, Sr., and Jno. Best, Jr., and Samuel Pickworth, which was\r\ngiven in against me in Court, were all of them altogether false and\r\nuntrue, and, besides the[ii.330] abovesaid Jno. Best hath been formerly\r\nwhipped and likewise is recorded for a liar. I would humbly beg of Your\r\nHonors to take it into your judicious and pious consideration, that my\r\nlife may not be taken away by such false evidences and witnesses as\r\nthese be; likewise, the evidence given in against me by Sarah Churchill\r\nand Mary Warren I am altogether ignorant of, and know nothing in the\r\nleast measure about it, nor nothing else concerning the crime of\r\nwitchcraft, for which I am condemned to die, as will be known to men\r\nand angels at the great day of judgment. Begging and imploring your\r\nprayers at the Throne of Grace in my behalf, and your poor and humble\r\npetitioner shall for ever pray, as she is bound in duty, for Your\r\nHonors' health and happiness in this life, and eternal felicity in the\r\nworld to come.\"\r\n\r\nAbigail, the wife of Francis Faulkner, and daughter of the Rev. Francis\r\nDane, of Andover, who was among those sentenced on the 17th of\r\nSeptember, had been examined, on the 11th of August, by Hathorne,\r\nCorwin, and Captain John Higginson, sitting as magistrates. Upon the\r\nprisoner's being brought in, the afflicted fell down, and went into\r\nfits, as usual. The magistrates asked the prisoner what she had to say.\r\nShe replied, \"I know nothing of it.\" The girls then renewed their\r\nperformances, declaring that her shape was at that moment torturing\r\nthem. The magistrates asked her if she did not see their sufferings.\r\nShe answered, \"Yes; but it is the Devil does it in my shape.\" Ann\r\nPutnam said that her spectre had afflicted her a few days before,\r\npulling her off her horse.[ii.331] Upon the touch of her person, the\r\nsufferings of the afflicted would cease for a time. The prisoner held a\r\nhandkerchief in her hand. The girls would screech out, declaring that,\r\nas she pressed the handkerchief, they were dreadfully squeezed. She\r\nthrew the handkerchief on the table; and they said, \"There are the\r\nshapes of Daniel Eames and Captain Floyd [two persons then in prison on\r\nthe charge of witchcraft] sitting on her handkerchief.\" Mary Warren\r\nenacted the part of being dragged against her will under the table by\r\nan invisible hand, from whose grasp she was at once released, upon the\r\nprisoner's being made to touch her. Notwithstanding all this, she\r\nprotested her innocence, and was remanded to jail. On the 30th, she was\r\nbrought out again. In the mean while, six had been executed. The usual\r\nmeans were employed to break her down; but all that was gained was,\r\nthat she owned she had expressed her indignation at the conduct of the\r\nafflicted, and was much excited against them \"for bringing her kindred\r\nout, and she did wish them ill: and, her spirit being raised, she did\r\npinch her hands together, and she knew not but that the Devil might\r\ntake that advantage; but it was the Devil, and not she, that afflicted\r\nthem.\" This was the only concession she would make; and they were\r\npuzzled to determine whether it was a confession, or not,—it having\r\nrather the appearance of clearing herself from all implication with the\r\nDevil, and leaving him on their hands—at any rate, they concluded to\r\nregard it in the latter sense; and she was[ii.332] duly convicted, and\r\nsentenced to death. Sir William Phips ordered a reprieve; and, after\r\nshe had been thirteen weeks in prison, he directed her to be discharged\r\non the ground of insufficient evidence. This, I think, is the only\r\ninstance of a special pardon granted during the proceedings.\r\n\r\nSamuel Wardwell, like most of the accused belonging to Andover, had\r\noriginally joined the crowd of the confessors; but he was too much of a\r\nman to remain in that company. He took back his confession, and met his\r\ndeath. While he was speaking to the people, at the gallows, declaring\r\nhis innocency, a puff of tobacco-smoke from the pipe of the\r\nexecutioner, as Calef informs us, \"coming in his face, interrupted his\r\ndiscourse: those accusers said that the Devil did hinder him with\r\nsmoke.\" The wicked creatures followed their victims to the last with\r\ntheir malignant outrages. The cart that carried the prisoners, on this\r\noccasion, to the hill, \"was for some time at a set: the afflicted and\r\nothers said that the Devil hindered it,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThe route by which they were conveyed from the jail, which was at the\r\nnorth corner of Federal and St. Peter's Streets, to the gallows, must\r\nhave been a cruelly painful and fatiguing one, particularly to infirm\r\nand delicate persons, as many of them were. It was through St. Peter's,\r\nup the whole length of Essex, and thence probably along Boston Street,\r\nfar towards Aborn Street; for the hill could only be ascended from that\r\ndirection. It must have been a rough and jolting[ii.333] operation; and\r\nit is not strange that the cart got \"set.\" It seems that the prisoners\r\nwere carried in a single cart. It was a large one, provided probably\r\nfor the occasion; and it is not unlikely that the reason why some who\r\nhad been condemned were not executed, was that the cart could not hold\r\nthem all at once. They were executed, one in June, five in July, five\r\nin August, and eight in September, with the intention, no doubt, by\r\ntaking them in instalments, to extend the acts of the tragedy, from\r\nmonth to month, indefinitely.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary for the safety of the accusers and prosecutors to\r\nprevent a revulsion of the public mind, or even the least diminution of\r\nthe popular violence against the supposed witches. As they all\r\nprotested their innocence to the moment of death, and exhibited a\r\nremarkably Christian deportment throughout the dreadful scenes they\r\nwere called to encounter from their arrest to their execution, there\r\nwas reason to apprehend that the people would gradually be led to feel\r\na sympathy for them, if not to entertain doubts of their guilt. To\r\nprevent this, and remove any impressions favorable to them that might\r\nbe made by the conduct and declarations of the convicts, the\r\nprosecutors were on the alert. After the prisoners had been swung off,\r\non the 22d of September, \"turning him to the bodies, Mr. Noyes said,\r\n'What a sad thing it is to see eight firebrands of hell hanging\r\nthere!'\" It was the last time his eyes were regaled by such a sight.\r\nThere were no more executions on Witch Hill.[ii.334]\r\n\r\nThree days before, a life had been taken by the officers of the law in\r\na manner so extraordinary, and marked by features so shocking, that\r\nthey find no parallel in the annals of America, and will continue to\r\narrest for ever the notice of mankind. The history and character of old\r\nGiles Corey have been given in preceding parts of this work. The only\r\npapers relating to him, on file as having been sworn to before the\r\nGrand Jury, are a few brief depositions. If he had been put on trial,\r\nwe might have had more. Elizabeth Woodwell testifies, that \"she saw\r\nGiles Corey at meeting at Salem on a lecture-day, since he has been in\r\nprison. He or his apparition came in, and sat in the middlemost seat of\r\nthe men's seats, by the post. This was the lecture-day before Bridget\r\nBishop was hanged. And I saw him come out with the rest of the people.\"\r\nMary Walcot, of course, swore to the same. And Mary Warren swore that\r\nCorey was hostile to her and afflicted her, because he thought she\r\n\"caused her master (John Procter) to ask more for a piece of meadow\r\nthan he (Corey) was willing to give.\" She also charged him with\r\n\"afflicting of her\" by his spectre while he was in prison, and\r\n\"described him in all his garments, both of hat, coat, and the color of\r\nthem,—with a cord about his waist and a white cap on his head, and in\r\nchains.\" There is reason to believe, that, while in prison, he\r\nexperienced great distress of mind. Although he had been a rough\r\ncharacter in earlier life, and given occasion to much scandal by his\r\ndisregard of public opinion, he always exhibited symp[ii.335]toms of a\r\ngenerous and sensitive nature. His foolish conduct in becoming so\r\npassionately engaged in the witchcraft proceedings, at their earliest\r\nstage, as to be incensed against his wife because she did not approve\r\nof or believe in them, and which led him to utter sentiments and\r\nexpressions that had been used against her; and so far yielding to the\r\naccusers as to allow them to get from him the deposition, which, while\r\nit failed to satisfy their demands, it was shameful for him to have\r\nbeen persuaded to give,—all these things, which after his own\r\napprehension and imprisonment he had leisure to ponder upon, preyed on\r\nhis mind. He saw the awful character of the delusion to which he had\r\nlent himself; that it had brought his prayerful and excellent wife to\r\nthe sentence of death, which had already been executed upon many other\r\ndevout and worthy persons. He knew that he was innocent of the crime of\r\nwitchcraft, and was now satisfied that all others were. Besides his own\r\nunfriendly course towards his wife, two of his four sons-in-law had\r\nturned against her. One (Crosby) had testified, and another (Parker)\r\nhad allowed his name to be used, as an adverse witness. In view of all\r\nthis, Corey made up his mind, determined on his course, and stood to\r\nthat determination. He resolved to expiate his own folly by a fate that\r\nwould satisfy the demands of the sternest criticism upon his conduct;\r\nproclaim his abhorrence of the prosecutions; and attest the strength of\r\nhis feelings towards those of his children who had been false, and\r\nthose who had been true, to his wife.[ii.336] He caused to be drawn up\r\nwhat has been called a will, although it is in reality a deed, and was\r\nduly recorded as such. Its phraseology is very strongly guarded, and\r\nmade to give it clear, full, and certain effect. It begins thus: \"Know\r\nye, &c., that I, Giles Corey, lying under great trouble and affliction,\r\nthrough which I am very weak in body, but in perfect memory,—knowing\r\nnot how soon I may depart this life; in consideration of which, and for\r\nthe fatherly love and affection which I have and do bear unto my\r\nbeloved son-in-law, William Cleeves, of the town of Beverly, and to my\r\nson-in-law, John Moulton, of the town of Salem, as also for divers\r\nother good causes and considerations me at the present especially\r\nmoving;\" and proceeds to convey and confirm all his property—\"lands,\r\nmeadow, housing, cattle, stock, movables and immovables, money,\r\napparel, ... and all other the aforesaid premises, with their\r\nappurtenances\"—to the said Cleeves and Moulton \"for ever, freely and\r\nquietly, without any manner of challenge, claim, or demand of me the\r\nsaid Giles Corey, or of any other person or persons whatsoever for me\r\nin my name, or by my cause, means, or procurement;\" and, in the use of\r\nall the language applicable to that end, he warrants and binds himself\r\nto defend the aforesaid conveyance and grant to Cleeves and Moulton,\r\ntheir heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns for ever. The\r\ndocument was properly signed, sealed, and delivered in the presence of\r\ncompetent witnesses, whose several signatures are indorsed to that\r\neffect. It was duly acknowledged[ii.337] before \"Thomas Wade, Justice\r\nof the Peace in Essex,\" and recorded forthwith. This transaction took\r\nplace in the jail at Ipswich.\r\n\r\nHis whole property being thus securely conveyed to his faithful\r\nsons-in-law, and placed beyond the reach of his own weakness or change\r\nof purpose, Corey resolved on a course that would surely try to the\r\nutmost the power of human endurance and firmness. He knew, that, if\r\nbrought to trial, his death was certain. He did not know but that\r\nconviction and execution, through the attainder connected with it,\r\nmight invalidate all attempts of his to convey his property. But it was\r\ncertain, that, if he should not be brought to trial and conviction, his\r\ndeed would stand, and nothing could break it, or defeat its effect. He\r\naccordingly made up his mind not to be tried. When called into court to\r\nanswer to the indictment found by the Grand Jury, he did not plead\r\n\"Guilty,\" or \"Not guilty,\" but stood mute. How often he was called\r\nforth, we are not informed; but nothing could shake him. No power on\r\nearth could unseal his lips.\r\n\r\nHe knew that he could have no trial that would deserve the name. To\r\nhave pleaded \"Not guilty\" would have made him, by his own act, a party\r\nto the proceeding, and have been, by implication, an assent to putting\r\nhis case to the decision of a blind, maddened, and utterly perverted\r\ntribunal. He would not, by any act or utterance of his, leave his case\r\nwith \"the country\" represented by a jury that embodied the passions of\r\nthe deluded and infatuated multitude[ii.338] around him. He knew that\r\nthe gates of justice were closed, and that truth had fled from the\r\nscene. He would have no part nor lot in the matter; refused to\r\nrecognize the court, made no response to its questions, and was dumb in\r\nits presence. He stands alone in the resolute defiance of his attitude.\r\nHe knew the penalty of suffering and agony he would have to pay; but he\r\nfreely and fearlessly encountered it. All that was needed to carry his\r\npoint was an unconquerable firmness, and he had it. He rendered it\r\nimpossible to bring him to trial; and thereby, in spite of the power\r\nand wrath of the whole country and its authorities, retained his right\r\nto dispose of his property; and bore his testimony against the\r\nwickedness and folly of the hour in tones that reached the whole world,\r\nand will resound through all the ages.\r\n\r\nWhen Corey took this ground, the Court found itself in a position of no\r\nlittle difficulty, and was probably at a loss what to do. No\r\ninformation has come to us of the details of the proceedings. If the\r\nusages in England on such occasions were adopted, the prisoner was\r\nthree times brought before the Court, and called to plead; the\r\nconsequences of persisting in standing mute being solemnly announced to\r\nhim at each time. If he remained obdurate, the sentence of _peine forte\r\net dure_ was passed upon him; and, remanded to prison, he was put into\r\na low and dark apartment. He would there be laid on his back on the\r\nbare floor, naked for the most part. A weight of iron would be placed\r\nupon him, not quite enough to crush him. He[ii.339] would have no\r\nsustenance, save only, on the first day, three morsels of the worst\r\nbread; and, on the second day, three draughts of standing water that\r\nshould be nearest to the prison door: and, in this situation, such\r\nwould be alternately his daily diet till he died, or till he answered.\r\nThe object of this terrible punishment was to induce the prisoner to\r\nplead to the indictment; upon doing which, he would be brought to trial\r\nin the ordinary way. The motive that led prisoners to stand mute in\r\nEngland is stated to have been, most generally, to save their property\r\nfrom confiscation. The practice of putting weights upon them, and\r\ngradually increasing them, was to force them, by the slowly increasing\r\ntorture, to yield.\r\n\r\nHow far the English practice was imitated in the case of Corey will\r\nremain for ever among the dread secrets of his prison-house. The\r\ntradition is, that the last act in the tragedy was in an open field\r\nnear the jail, somewhere between Howard-street Burial Ground and Brown\r\nStreet. It is said that Corey urged the executioners to increase the\r\nweight which was crushing him, that he told them it was of no use to\r\nexpect him to yield, that there could be but one way of ending the\r\nmatter, and that they might as well pile on the rocks. Calef says,\r\nthat, as his body yielded to the pressure, his tongue protruded from\r\nhis mouth, and an official forced it back with his cane. Some persons\r\nnow living remember a popular superstition, lingering in the minds of\r\nsome of the more ignorant class, that Corey's ghost haunted the grounds\r\nwhere this barbar[ii.340]ous deed was done; and that boys, as they\r\nsported in the vicinity, were in the habit of singing a ditty beginning\r\nthus:—\r\n\r\n\"'More weight! more weight!'\r\nGiles Corey he cried.\"\r\n\r\nFor a person of more than eighty-one years of age, this must be allowed\r\nto have been a marvellous exhibition of prowess; illustrating, as\r\nstrongly as any thing in human history, the power of a resolute will\r\nover the utmost pain and agony of body, and demonstrating that Giles\r\nCorey was a man of heroic nerve, and of a spirit that could not be\r\nsubdued.\r\n\r\nIt produced a deep effect, as it was feared that it would. The bearing\r\nof all the sufferers at all the stages of the proceedings, and at their\r\nexecution, had told in their favor; but the course of Giles Corey\r\nprofoundly affected the public mind. This must have been noticed by the\r\nmanagers of the prosecutions; and they felt that some extraordinary\r\nexpedient was necessary to renew, and render more intense than ever,\r\nthe general infatuation. From the very beginning, there had been great\r\nskill and adroitness in arranging the order of incidents, and supplying\r\nthe requisite excitements at the right moments and the right points.\r\nSome persons—it can only be conjectured who—had, all along, been behind\r\nthe scenes, giving direction and materials to the open actors. This\r\nunseen power was in the village; and the movements it devised generally\r\nproceeded from Thomas Putnam's house, or the parsonage. It was on hand\r\nto meet the contingency[ii.341] created by Corey's having actually\r\ncarried out to the last his resolution to meet a form of death that\r\nwould, if any thing could, cause a re-action in the public mind; and\r\nthe following stratagem was contrived to turn the manner of his death\r\ninto the means of more than ever blinding and infatuating the people.\r\nIt was the last and one of the most artful strokes of policy by the\r\nprosecutors. On the day after the death of Corey, and two days before\r\nthe execution of his wife, Mary Easty, and the six others, Judge\r\nSewall, then in Salem, received a letter from Thomas Putnam to this\r\neffect:—\r\n\r\n\"Last night, my daughter Ann was grievously tormented by witches,\r\nthreatening that she should be pressed to death before Giles Corey;\r\nbut, through the goodness of a gracious God, she had at last a little\r\nrespite. Whereupon there appeared unto her (she said) a man in a\r\nwinding-sheet, who told her that Giles Corey had murdered him by\r\npressing him to death with his feet; but that the Devil there appeared\r\nunto him, and covenanted with him, and promised him that he should not\r\nbe hanged. The apparition said God hardened his heart, that he should\r\nnot hearken to the advice of the Court, and so die an easy death;\r\nbecause, as it said, it must be done to him as he has done to me. The\r\napparition also said that Giles Corey was carried to the Court for\r\nthis, and that the jury had found the murder; and that her father knew\r\nthe man, and the thing was done before she was born.\"\r\n\r\nCotton Mather represented this vision, made to Ann Putnam, as proof\r\npositive of a divine communication to her, because, as he says, she\r\ncould not have received[ii.342] her information from a human source, as\r\neverybody had forgotten the affair long ago; and that she never could\r\nhave heard of it, happening, as it did, before she was born. Bringing\r\nup this old matter to meet the effect produced by Corey's death was\r\nindeed a skilful move; and it answered its purpose probably to a\r\nconsiderable extent. The man whom Corey was thus charged with having\r\nmurdered seventeen years before died in a manner causing some gossip at\r\nthe time; and a coroner's jury found that he had been \"bruised to\r\ndeath, having clodders of blood about the heart.\" Bringing the affair\r\nback to the public mind, with the story of Ann Putnam's vision, was\r\nwell calculated to meet and check any sympathy that might threaten to\r\narise in favor of Corey. But the trick, however ingenious, will not\r\nstand the test of scrutiny. Mather's statement that everybody had\r\nforgotten the transaction, and that Ann could only have known of it\r\nsupernaturally, is wholly untenable; for it was precisely one of those\r\nthings that are never forgotten in a country village: it had always\r\nbeen kept alive as a part of the gossip of the neighborhood in\r\nconnection with Corey; and her own father, as is unwittingly\r\nacknowledged, knew the man, and all about it. Of course, the girl had\r\nheard of it from him and others. The industry that had ransacked the\r\ntraditions and collected the scandal of the whole country, far and\r\nnear, for stories that were brought in evidence against all the\r\nprisoners, had not failed to pick up this choice bit against Corey. The\r\nonly reason why it had not[ii.343] before been brought out was because\r\nhe had not been on trial. The man who died with \"clodders of blood\r\nabout his heart,\" seventeen years before, was an unfortunate and\r\nworthless person, who had incurred punishment for his misconduct while\r\na servant on Corey's farm, and afterwards at the hands of his own\r\nfamily: and he does not appear to have mended his morals upon passing\r\ninto the spiritual world; for the statement of his ghost to Ann Putnam,\r\nthat the jury had found Corey guilty of murder, and that the Court was\r\nhindered by some enchantment from proceeding against him, is disproved\r\nby the record which is—as has been mentioned in the First Part, vol. i.\r\np. 185—that the man was carried back to his house by Corey's wife, and\r\ndied there some time after; and the Court did no more than fine Corey\r\nfor the punishment he had inflicted upon him while in his service, and\r\nwhich the evidence showed was repeated by his parents after his return\r\nto his own family.\r\n\r\nThomas Putnam's letter and Ann's vision were the last things of the\r\nkind that occurred. The delusion was approaching its close, and the\r\npeople were beginning to be restored to their senses.\r\n\r\nWhen it became known that Corey's resolution was likely to hold out,\r\nand that no torments or cruelties of any kind could subdue his firm and\r\ninvincible spirit, Mr. Noyes hurried a special meeting of his church on\r\na week-day, and had the satisfaction of dealing the same awful doom\r\nupon him as upon Rebecca Nurse. The entry in the record of the First\r\nChurch is as follows:[ii.344]—\r\n\r\n\"Sept. 18, G. Corey was excommunicated: the cause of it was, that he\r\nbeing accused and indicted for the sin of witchcraft, he refused to\r\nplead, and so incurred the sentence and penalty of _pain fort dure_;\r\nbeing undoubtedly either guilty of the sin of witchcraft, or of\r\nthrowing himself upon sudden and certain death, if he were otherwise\r\ninnocent.\"\r\n\r\nThis attempt to introduce a form of argument into a church act of\r\nexcommunication is a slight but significant symptom of its having\r\nbecome felt that the breath of reason had begun to raise a ripple upon\r\nthe surface of the public mind. It increased slowly, but steadily to a\r\ngale that beat with severity upon Mr. Noyes and all his\r\nfellow-persecutors to their dying day.\r\n\r\nAfter the executions, on the 22d of September, the Court adjourned to\r\nmeet some weeks subsequently; and it was, no doubt, their expectation\r\nto continue from month to month to hold sessions, and supply, each\r\ntime, new cart-loads of victims to the hangman. But a sudden collapse\r\ntook place in the machinery, and they met no more. The executive\r\nauthority intervened, and their functions ceased. The curtain fell\r\nunexpectedly, and the tragedy ended. It is not known precisely what\r\ncaused this sudden change. It is probable, that a revolution had been\r\ngoing on some time in the public mind, which was kept for a while from\r\nnotice, but at last became too apparent and too serious to be\r\ndisregarded. It has generally been attributed to the fact, that the\r\ngirls became over-confident, and struck too high. They had ventured, as\r\nwe have seen, to cry[ii.345] out against the Rev. Samuel Willard, but\r\nwere rebuked and silenced by the Court. Whoever began to waver in his\r\nconfidence of the correctness of the proceedings was in danger of being\r\nattacked by them; and, as a general thing, when a person was \"cried out\r\nupon,\" it may be taken as proof that he had spoken against them.\r\nIncrease Mather, the president of Harvard College, called by Eliot \"the\r\nfather of the New-England clergy,\" was understood not to go so far as\r\nhis son Cotton in sustaining the proceedings; and a member of his\r\nfamily was accused. The wife of Sir William Phips sympathized with\r\nthose who suffered prosecution, and is said to have written an order\r\nfor the release of a prisoner from jail. She was cried out upon. It may\r\nhave been noticed, that, though Jonathan Corwin sat with Hathorne as an\r\nexamining magistrate and assistant, and signed the commitments of the\r\nprisoners, he never took an active part, but was a silent and passive\r\nagent in the scene. He was subsequently raised to the bench; but there\r\nis reason to believe that his mind was not clear as to the correctness\r\nof the proceedings. This probably became known to the accusing girls;\r\nfor they cried out repeatedly against his wife's mother, a respectable\r\nand venerable lady in Boston. The accusers, in aiming at such\r\ncharacters, overestimated their power; and the tide began to turn\r\nagainst them. But what finally broke the spell by which they had held\r\nthe minds of the whole colony in bondage was their accusation, in\r\nOctober, of Mrs. Hale, the wife of the[ii.346] minister of the First\r\nChurch in Beverly. Her genuine and distinguished virtues had won for\r\nher a reputation, and secured in the hearts of the people a confidence,\r\nwhich superstition itself could not sully nor shake. Mr. Hale had been\r\nactive in all the previous proceedings; but he knew the innocence and\r\npiety of his wife, and he stood forth between her and the storm he had\r\nhelped to raise: although he had driven it on while others were its\r\nvictims, he turned and resisted it when it burst in upon his own\r\ndwelling. The whole community became convinced that the accusers in\r\ncrying out upon Mrs. Hale, had perjured themselves, and from that\r\nmoment their power was destroyed; the awful delusion was dispelled, and\r\na close put to one of the most tremendous tragedies in the history of\r\nreal life. The wildest storm, perhaps, that ever raged in the moral\r\nworld, became a calm; the tide that had threatened to overwhelm every\r\nthing in its fury, sunk back to its peaceful bed. There are few, if\r\nany, other instances in history, of a revolution of opinion and feeling\r\nso sudden, so rapid, and so complete. The images and visions that had\r\npossessed the bewildered imaginations of the people flitted away, and\r\nleft them standing in the sunshine of reason and their senses; and they\r\ncould have exclaimed, as they witnessed them passing off, in the\r\nlanguage of the great master of the drama and of human nature, but that\r\ntheir rigid Puritan principles would not, it is presumed, have\r\npermitted them, even in that moment of rescue and deliverance, to quote\r\nShakspeare,[ii.347]—\r\n\r\n\"The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,\r\nAnd these are of them. Whither are they vanished?\r\nInto the air; and what seemed corporal, melted\r\nAs breath into the wind.\"\r\n\r\nSir William Phips well knew that the public sentiment demanded a stop\r\nto be put to the prosecutions. Besides that many of the people had lost\r\nall faith in the grounds on which they had been conducted, an influence\r\nfrom the higher orders of society began to make itself felt. Hutchinson\r\nsays, \"Although many such had suffered, yet there remained in prison a\r\nnumber of women of as reputable families as any in the towns where they\r\nlived, and several persons, of still superior rank, were hinted at by\r\nthe pretended bewitched, or by the confessing witches. Some had been\r\npublicly named. Dudley Bradstreet, a justice of peace, who had been\r\nappointed one of President Dudley's council, and who was son to the\r\nworthy old governor, then living, found it necessary to abscond. Having\r\nbeen remiss in prosecuting, he had been charged by some of the\r\nafflicted as a confederate. His brother, John Bradstreet, was forced to\r\nfly also.\"\r\n\r\nThe termination of the proceedings was probably effectually secured by\r\nthe spirited course of certain parties in Andover, who, at the first\r\nmoment of its appearing that the public sentiment was changing,\r\ncommenced actions for slander against the accusers.\r\n\r\nThe result of the whole matter was, that, while some of the judges,\r\nmagistrates, and ministers persisted in their fanatical zeal, the great\r\nbody of the people, high and low, were rescued from the\r\ndelusion.[ii.348]\r\n\r\nWhile, in the course of our story, we have witnessed some shocking\r\ninstances of the violation of the most sacred affections and\r\nobligations of life, in husbands and wives, parents and children,\r\ntestifying against each other, and exerting themselves for mutual\r\ndestruction, we must not overlook the many instances in which filial,\r\nparental, and fraternal fidelity and love have shone conspicuously. It\r\nwas dangerous to befriend an accused person. Procter stood by his wife\r\nto protect her, and it cost him his life. Children protested against\r\nthe treatment of their parents, and they were all thrown into prison.\r\nDaniel Andrew, a citizen of high standing, who had been deputy to the\r\nGeneral Court, asserted, in the boldest language, his belief of Rebecca\r\nNurse's innocence; and he had to fly the country to save his life. Many\r\ndevoted sons and daughters clung to their parents, visited them in\r\nprison in defiance of a bloodthirsty mob; kept by their side on the way\r\nto execution; expressed their love, sympathy, and reverence to the\r\nlast; and, by brave and perilous enterprise, got possession of their\r\nremains, and bore them back under the cover of midnight to their own\r\nthresholds, and to graves kept consecrated by their prayers and tears.\r\nOne noble young man is said to have effected his mother's escape from\r\nthe jail, and secreted her in the woods until after the delusion had\r\npassed away, provided food and clothing for her, erected a wigwam for\r\nher shelter, and surrounded her with every comfort her situation would\r\nadmit of. The poor creature must,[ii.349] however, have endured a great\r\namount of suffering; for one of her larger limbs was fractured in the\r\nall but desperate attempt to rescue her from the prison-walls.\r\n\r\nThe Special Court being no longer suffered to meet, a permanent and\r\nregular tribunal, called the Superior Court of Judicature, was\r\nestablished, consisting of the Deputy-governor, William Stoughton,\r\nChief-justice; and Thomas Danforth, John Richards, Wait Winthrop, and\r\nSamuel Sewall, associate justices. They held a Court at Salem, in\r\nJanuary, 1693. Hutchinson says that, on this occasion, the Grand Jury\r\nfound about fifty indictments. The following persons were brought to\r\ntrial: Rebecca Jacobs, Margaret Jacobs, Sarah Buckley, Job Tookey,\r\nHannah Tyler, Candy, Mary Marston, Elizabeth Johnson, Abigail Barker,\r\nMary Tyler, Sarah Hawkes, Mary Wardwell, Mary Bridges, Hannah Post,\r\nSarah Bridges, Mary Osgood, Mary Lacy, Jr., Sarah Wardwell, Elizabeth\r\nJohnson, Jr., and Mary Post. The three last were condemned, but not\r\nexecuted: all the rest were acquitted. Considering that the \"spectral\r\nevidence\" was wholly thrown out at these trials, the facts that the\r\ngrand jury, under the advice of the Court, brought in so many\r\nindictments, and that three were actually convicted, are as\r\ndiscreditable to the regular Court as the convictions at the Special\r\nCourt are to that body. It has been said that the Special Court had not\r\nan adequate representation of lawyers in its composition; and the\r\nresults of its proceedings have been ascribed to that circumstance. It\r\nhas been[ii.350] held up disparagingly in comparison with the regular\r\nCourt that succeeded it. But, in fact, the regular Court consisted of\r\npersons all of whom sat in the Special Court, with the exception of\r\nDanforth. But his proceedings in originating the arrests for witchcraft\r\nin the fall of 1691, and his action when presiding at the preliminary\r\nexamination of John Procter, Elizabeth Procter, and Sarah Cloyse, at\r\nSalem, April 11, 1692, show that, so far as the permission of gross\r\nirregularities and the admission of absurd kinds of testimony are\r\nconcerned, the regular Court gained nothing by his sitting with it,\r\nunless his views had been thoroughly changed in the mean time. The\r\ntruth is, that the judges, magistrates, and legislature were as much to\r\nblame, in this whole business, as the ministers, and much more slow to\r\ncome to their senses, and make amends for their wrong-doing.\r\n\r\nAll the facts known to us, and all the statements that have come down\r\nto us, require us to believe, that none who confessed, and stood to\r\ntheir confession, were brought to trial. All who were condemned either\r\nmaintained their innocence from the first, or, if persuaded or overcome\r\ninto a confession, voluntarily took it back and disowned it before\r\ntrial. If this be so, then the name of every person condemned ought to\r\nbe held in lasting honor, as preferring to die rather than lie, or\r\nstand to a lie. It required great strength of mind to take back a\r\nconfession; relinquish life and liberty; go down into a dungeon, loaded\r\nwith irons; and from thence to ascend the gallows. It relieves[ii.351]\r\nthe mind to think, that Abigail Hobbs, wicked and shocking as her\r\nconduct had been towards Mr. Burroughs and others, came to herself, and\r\noffered her life in atonement for her sin.\r\n\r\nThe Court continued the trials at successive sessions during the\r\nspring, all resulting in acquittals, until in May, 1693, Sir William\r\nPhips, by proclamation, discharged all. Hutchinson says, \"Such a\r\njail-delivery has never been known in New England.\" The number then\r\nreleased is stated to have been one hundred and fifty. How many had\r\nbeen apprehended, during the whole affair, we have no means of knowing.\r\nTwenty, counting Giles Corey, had been executed. Two at least, Ann\r\nFoster and Sarah Osburn, had died in jail: it is not improbable that\r\nothers perished under the bodily and mental sufferings there. We find\r\nfrequent expressions indicating that many died in prison. A\r\nconsiderable number of children, and some adults whose friends were\r\nable to give the heavy bonds required and had influence enough to\r\nsecure the favor, had some time before been removed to private custody.\r\nQuite a considerable number had succeeded in breaking jail and eluding\r\nrecapture. Upon the whole, there must have been several hundreds\r\ncommitted. Even after acquittal by a jury, and the Governor's\r\nproclamation, none were set at liberty until they had paid all charges;\r\nincluding board for the whole time of their imprisonment, jailer's\r\nfees, and fees of Court of all kinds. The families of many had become\r\nutterly impoverished.[ii.352]\r\n\r\nThe sufferings of the prisoners and of their relatives and connections\r\nare perhaps best illustrated by presenting the substance of a few of\r\nthe petitions for their release, found among the files. The friends of\r\nthe parties, in these cases, were not in a condition to give the bonds,\r\nand they probably remained in jail until the general discharge; and how\r\nlong after, before the means could be raised to pay all dues, we cannot\r\nknow.[D]\r\n[ii.353]\r\nMargaret Jacobs had to remain in jail after the Governor's proclamation\r\nhad directed the release of all prisoners, because she could not pay\r\nthe fees and charges. Her grandfather had been executed, and all his\r\nfurniture, stock, and moveable property seized by the marshal or\r\nsheriff. Her father escaped the warrant by a sudden flight from his\r\nhome under the cover of midnight, and was in exile \"beyond the seas;\"\r\nher mother and herself taken at the time by the officers serving the\r\nwarrants against them; the younger children of the family, left without\r\nprotection, had dispersed, and been thrown upon the charity of\r\nneighbors; the house had been stripped of its contents, left open, and\r\ndeserted. She had not a shilling in the world, and knew not where to\r\nlook for aid. She[ii.354] was taken back to prison, and remained there\r\nfor some time, until a person named Gammon, apparently a stranger,\r\nhappened to hear of her case, and, touched with compassion, raised the\r\nmoney required, and released her. It was long before the affairs of the\r\nJacobs' family were so far retrieved as to enable them to refund the\r\nmoney to the noble-hearted fisherman. How many others lingered in\r\nprison, or how long, we have no means of ascertaining.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the proceedings at the examinations and trials, it is\r\nimpossible to avoid being struck with the infatuation of the\r\nmagistrates and judges. They acted throughout in the character and\r\nspirit of prosecuting officers, put leading and ensnaring questions to\r\nthe prisoners, adopted a browbeating deportment towards them, and\r\npursued them with undisguised hostility. They assumed their guilt from\r\nthe first,[ii.355] and endeavored to force them to confess; treating\r\nthem as obstinate culprits because they would not. Every kind of\r\nirregularity was permitted. The marshal was encouraged in perpetual\r\ninterference to prejudice the persons on trial, watching and reporting\r\naloud to the Court every movement of their hands or heads or feet.\r\nOther persons were allowed to speak out, from the body of the crowd,\r\nwhatever they chose to say adverse to the prisoner. Accusers were\r\nsuffered to make private communications to the magistrates and judges\r\nbefore or during the hearings. The presiding officers showed off their\r\nsmartness in attempts to make the persons on trial before them appear\r\nat a disadvantage. In some instances, as in the case of Sarah Good, the\r\nmagistrate endeavored to deceive the accused by representing falsely\r\nthe testimony given by another. The people in and around the court-room\r\nwere allowed to act the part of a noisy mob, by clamors and threatening\r\noutcries; and juries were overawed to bring in verdicts of conviction,\r\nand rebuked from the bench if they exercised their rightful prerogative\r\nwithout regard to the public passions. The chief-justice, in\r\nparticular, appears to have been actuated by violent prejudice against\r\nthe prisoners, and to have conducted the trials, all along, with a\r\nspirit that bears the aspect of animosity.\r\n\r\nThere is one point of view in which he must be held responsible for the\r\nblood that was shed, and the infamy that, in consequence, attaches to\r\nthe proceedings. It may well be contended, that not a conviction\r\nwould[ii.356] have taken place, but for a notion of his which he\r\narbitrarily enforced as a rule of law. It was a part of the theory\r\nrelating to witchcraft, that the Devil made use of the spectres, or\r\napparitions, of some persons to afflict others. From this conceded\r\npostulate, a division of opinion arose. Some maintained that the Devil\r\ncould employ only the spectres of persons in league with him; others\r\naffirmed, that he could send upon his evil errands the spectres of\r\ninnocent persons, without their consent or knowledge. The chief-justice\r\nheld the former opinion, against the judgment of many others,\r\narbitrarily established it as a rule of Court, and peremptorily\r\ninstructed juries to regard it as binding upon them in making their\r\nverdicts. The consequence was that a verdict of \"Guilty\" became\r\ninevitable. But few at that time doubted the veracity of the \"afflicted\r\npersons,\" which was thought to be demonstrated to the very senses by\r\ntheir fits and sufferings, in the presence of the Court, jury, and all\r\nbeholders. When they swore that they saw the shapes of Bridget Bishop,\r\nor Rebecca Nurse, or George Burroughs, choking or otherwise torturing a\r\nperson, the fact was regarded as beyond question.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners took the ground, that the statements made by the\r\nwitnesses, even if admitted, were not proof against them; for the Devil\r\nmight employ the spectres of innocent persons, or of whomsoever he\r\nchose, without the knowledge of the persons whose shapes were thus used\r\nby him. When Mrs. Ann Putnam swore that she had seen the spectre of\r\nRebecca Nurse[ii.357] afflicting various persons; and that the said\r\nspectre acknowledged to her, that \"she had killed Benjamin Houlton, and\r\nJohn Fuller, and Rebecca Shepard,\"—the answer of the prisoner was, \"I\r\ncannot help it: the Devil may appear in my shape.\" When the examining\r\nmagistrate put the question to Susanna Martin, \"How comes your\r\nappearance to hurt these?\" Martin replied, \"I cannot tell. He that\r\nappeared in Samuel's shape, a glorified saint, can appear in any one's\r\nshape.\" The Rev. John Wise, in his noble appeal in favor of John\r\nProcter, argued to the same point. But the chief-justice was inexorably\r\ndeaf to all reason; compelled the jury to receive, as absolute law,\r\nthat the Devil could not use the shape of an innocent person; and, as\r\nthe \"afflicted\" swore that they saw the shapes of the prisoners\r\nactually engaged in the diabolical work, there was no room left for\r\nquestion, and they must return a verdict of \"Guilty.\"\r\n\r\nIn this way, innocent persons were slaughtered by a dogma in the mind\r\nof an obstinate judge. Dogmas have perverted courts and governments in\r\nall ages. A fabrication of fancy, an arbitrary verbal proposition, has\r\nbeen exalted above reason, and made to extinguish common sense. The\r\nworld is full of such dogmas. They mislead the actions of men, and\r\nconfound the page of history. \"The king cannot die\" is one of them. It\r\nis held as an axiom of political and constitutional truth. So an entire\r\ndynasty, crowded with a more glorious life than any other, is struck\r\nfrom the annals of an empire. In the public records of Eng[ii.358]land,\r\nthe existence of the Commonwealth is ignored; and the traces of its\r\ngreat events are erased from the archives of the government, which, in\r\nall its formulas and official papers, proclaims a lie. A hunted\r\nfugitive, wandering in disguise through foreign lands, without a foot\r\nof ground on the globe that he could call his own, is declared in all\r\npublic acts, parliamentary and judicial, and even by those assuming to\r\nutter the voice of history, to have actually reigned all the time. In\r\nour country and in our day, we are perplexed, and our public men\r\nbewildered, by a similar dogma. The merest fabric of human contrivance,\r\na particular form of political society, is impiously clothed with an\r\nessential attribute of God alone; and ephemeral politicians are\r\nannouncing, as an eternal law of Providence, that \"a State cannot die.\"\r\nThe mischiefs that result, in the management of human affairs, from\r\nenthroning dogmas over reason, truth, and fact, are, as they ever have\r\nbeen, incalculable.\r\n\r\nChief-justice Stoughton appears to have kept his mind chained to his\r\ndogma to the last. It rendered him wholly incapable of opening his eyes\r\nto the light of truth. He held on to spectral evidence, and his\r\ncorollary from it, when everybody else had abandoned both. He would not\r\nadmit that he, or any one concerned, had been in error. He never could\r\nbear to hear any persons express penitence or regret for the part they\r\nhad taken in the proceedings. When the public delusion had so far\r\nsubsided that it became difficult to procure the execution of a witch,\r\nhe was[ii.359] disturbed and incensed to such a degree that he\r\nabandoned his seat on the bench. During a session of the Court at\r\nCharlestown, in January, 1692-3, \"word was brought in, that a reprieve\r\nwas sent to Salem, and had prevented the execution of seven of those\r\nthat were there condemned, which so moved the chief judge that he said\r\nto this effect: 'We were in a way to have cleared the land of them; who\r\nit is that obstructs the cause of justice, I know not: the Lord be\r\nmerciful to the country!' and so went off the bench, and came no more\r\ninto that Court.\"\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the judges as appearing to be infatuated, not on\r\naccount of the opinions they held on the subject of witchcraft, for\r\nthese were the opinions of their age; nor from the peculiar doctrine\r\ntheir chief enforced upon them, for that was entertained by many, and,\r\nas a mere theory, was perhaps as logically deducible from the prevalent\r\ndoctrines as any other. Their infatuation consisted in not having eyes\r\nto see, or ears to hear, evidences continually occurring of the\r\nuntruthful arts and tricks of the afflicted children, of their cunning\r\nevasions, and, in some instances, palpable falsehoods. Then, further,\r\nthere was solid and substantial evidence before them that ought to have\r\nmade them pause and consider, if not doubt and disbelieve. We find the\r\nfollowing paper among the files:—\r\n\r\nThe Testimony of John Putnam, Sr., and Rebecca his Wife, saith that our\r\nson-in-law John Fuller, and our daughter Rebecca Shepard, did both of\r\nthem die a most violent death (and died acting very strangely at the\r\ntime of[ii.360] their death); further saith, that we did judge then\r\nthat they both died of a malignant fever, and had no suspicion of\r\nwithcraft of any, neither can we accuse the prisoner at the bar of any\r\nsuch thing.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we recall the testimony of Ann Putnam the mother, and find that\r\nthe afflicted generally charged the death of the above-named persons\r\nupon the shape of Rebecca Nurse, we perceive how absolutely Captain\r\nJohn Putnam and his wife discredit their testimony. The opinion of the\r\nfather and mother of Fuller and Shepard ought to have had weight with\r\nthe Court. They were persons of the highest standing, and of recognized\r\nintelligence and judgment. They were old church-members, and eminently\r\northodox in all their sentiments. They were the heads of a great\r\nfamily. He had represented the town in the General Court the year\r\nbefore. No man in this part of the country was more noted for strong\r\ngood sense than Captain John Putnam. This deposition is honorable to\r\ntheir memory, and clears them from all responsibility for the extent to\r\nwhich the afflicted persons were allowed to sway the judgment of the\r\nCourt. Taken in connection with the paper signed by so large a portion\r\nof the best people of the village, in behalf of Rebecca Nurse, it\r\nproves that the blame for the shocking proceedings in the witchcraft\r\nprosecutions cannot be laid upon the local population, but rests wholly\r\nupon the Court and the public authorities.\r\n\r\nThe Special Court that condemned the persons charged with witchcraft in\r\n1692 is justly open to[ii.361] censure for the absence of all\r\ndiscrimination of evidence, and for a prejudgment of the cases\r\nsubmitted to them. In view of the then existing law and the practice in\r\nthe mother-country under it, they ought to have the benefit of the\r\nadmission that they did, in other respects than those mentioned, no\r\nmore and no worse than was to be expected. And Cotton Mather, in the\r\n\"Magnalia,\" vindicates them on this ground:—\r\n\r\n\"They consulted the precedents of former times, and precepts laid down\r\nby learned writers about witchcraft; as, Keeble on the Common Law,\r\nchap. 'Conjuration' (an author approved by the twelve judges of our\r\nnation): also, Sir Matthew Hale's Trials of Witches, printed anno 1682;\r\nGlanvill's Collection of Sundry Trials in England and Ireland in the\r\nyears 1658, '61, '63, '64, and '81; Bernard's Guide to Jury-men;\r\nBaxter's and R.B., their histories about Witches, and their\r\nDiscoveries; Cotton Mather's Memorable Providences relating to\r\nWitchcraft, printed 1685.\"\r\n\r\nSo far as the medical profession at the time is concerned, it must be\r\nadmitted that they bear a full share of responsibility for the\r\nproceedings. They gave countenance and currency to the idea of\r\nwitchcraft in the public mind, and were very generally in the habit,\r\nwhen a patient did not do well under their prescriptions, of getting\r\nrid of all difficulty by saying that \"an evil hand\" was upon him. Their\r\nopinion to this effect is cited throughout, and appears in a large\r\nnumber of the documents. There were coroners' juries in cases where it\r\nwas suspected that a person[ii.362] died of witchcraft. It is much to\r\nbe regretted that none of their verdicts have been preserved. Drawn up\r\nby an attending \"chirurgeon,\" they would illustrate the state of\r\nprofessional science at that day, by informing us of the marks,\r\nindications, and conditions of the bodily organization by which the\r\ntraces of the Devil's hand were believed to be discoverable. All we\r\nknow is that, in particular cases, as that of Bray Wilkins's grandson\r\nDaniel, the jury found decisive proof that he had died by \"an evil\r\nhand.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not to be denied or concealed, that the clergy were instrumental\r\nin bringing on the witchcraft delusion in 1692. As the supposed agents\r\nof the mischief belonged to the supernatural and spiritual world, which\r\nhas ever been considered their peculiar province, it was thought that\r\nthe advice and co-operation of ministers were particularly appropriate\r\nand necessary. Opposition to prevailing vices and attempts to reform\r\nsociety were considered at that time in the light of a conflict with\r\nSatan himself; and he was thought to be the ablest minister who had the\r\ngreatest power over the invisible enemy, and could most easily and\r\neffectively avert his blows, and counteract his baleful influence. This\r\ngave the clergy the front in the battle against the hosts of Belial.\r\nThey were proud of the position, and were stimulated to distinguish\r\nthemselves in the conflict. Cotton Mather represents that ministers\r\nwere honored by the special hostility of the great enemy of souls,\r\n\"more dogged by the Devil than any other men,\" just as, according to\r\nhis philosophy,[ii.363] the lightning struck the steeples of churches\r\nmore frequently than other buildings because the Prince of the Power of\r\nthe Air particularly hated the places where the sound of the gospel was\r\nheard. There were, moreover, it is to be feared, ministers whose\r\nambition to acquire influence and power had been allowed to become a\r\nruling principle, and who favored the delusion because thereby their\r\nobject could be most surely achieved by carrying the people to the\r\ngreatest extremes of credulity, superstition, and fanatical blindness.\r\n\r\nBut justice requires it to be said that the ministers, as a general\r\nthing, did not take the lead after the proceedings had assumed their\r\nmost violent aspect, and the disastrous effects been fully brought to\r\nview. It may be said, on the contrary, that they took the lead, as a\r\nclass, in checking the delusion, and rescuing the public mind from its\r\ncontrol. Prior to the time when they were called upon to give their\r\nadvice to the government, they probably followed Cotton Mather: after\r\nthat, they seemed to have freed themselves generally from his\r\ninfluence. The names of Dane and Barnard of Andover, Higginson of\r\nSalem, Cheever of Marblehead, Hubbard and Wise of Ipswich, Payson and\r\nPhillips of Rowley, Allin of Salisbury, and Capen of Topsfield, appear\r\nin behalf of persons accused. To come forward in their defence shows\r\ncourage, and proves that their influence was in the right direction,\r\neven while the proceedings were at their height. Mr. Hale, of Beverly,\r\nabandoned the prosecutions, and ex[ii.364]pressed his disapprobation of\r\nthem, before the government or the Court relaxed the vigor of their\r\noperations, as is sufficiently proved by the fact that the \"afflicted\r\nchildren\" cried out against his wife. Willard, and James Allen, and\r\nMoody, and John Bailey, and even Increase Mather, of Boston, openly\r\ndiscountenanced the course things were taking. The latter circulated a\r\nletter from his London correspondent, a person whose opinion was\r\nentitled to weight, condemning in the strongest terms the doctrine of\r\nthe chief-justice, as follows: \"All that I speak with much wonder that\r\nany man, much less a man of such abilities, learning, and experience as\r\nMr. Stoughton, should take up a persuasion that the Devil cannot assume\r\nthe likeness of an innocent, to afflict another person. In my opinion,\r\nit is a persuasion utterly destitute of any solid reason to render it\r\nso much as probable.\" The ministers may have been among the first to\r\nbring on the delusion; but the foregoing facts prove, that, as a\r\nprofession, they were the first to attempt to check and discountenance\r\nthe prosecutions. While we are required, in all fairness, to give this\r\ncredit to the clergy in general, it would be false to the obligations\r\nof historical truth and justice to attempt to palliate the conduct of\r\nsome of them. Whoever considers all that Mr. Parris, according to his\r\nown account, said and did, cannot but shrink from the necessity of\r\npassing judgment upon him, and find relief in leaving him to that\r\ntribunal which alone can measure the extent of human\r\nresponsibility,[ii.365] and sound the depths of the heart. Lawson threw\r\ninto the conflagration all the combustible materials his eloquence and\r\ntalents, heated, it is to be feared, by resentment, could contribute.\r\nDr. Bentley, in his \"Description and History of Salem\" (Mass. Hist.\r\nColl., 1st series, vol. vi.) says, \"Mr. Noyes came out and publicly\r\nconfessed his error, never concealed a circumstance, never excused\r\nhimself; visited, loved, blessed, the survivors whom he had injured;\r\nasked forgiveness always, and consecrated the residue of his life to\r\nbless mankind.\" It is to be hoped that the statement is correct. There\r\nwere several points of agreement between Noyes and Bentley. Both were\r\nmen of ability and learning. Like Bentley, Noyes lived and died a\r\nbachelor; and, like him, was a man of lively and active temperament,\r\nand, in the general tenor of his life, benevolent and disinterested.\r\nPerhaps congeniality in these points led Bentley to make the statement,\r\njust quoted, a little too strong. He wrote more than a century after\r\nthe witchcraft proceedings; just at that point when tradition had\r\nbecome inflated by all manner of current talk, of fable mixed with\r\nfact, before the correcting and expunging hand of a severe scrutiny of\r\nrecords and documents had commenced its work. The drag-net of time had\r\ndrawn along with it every thing that anybody had said; but the process\r\nof sifting and discrimination had not begun. His kindly and ingenuous\r\nnature led him to believe, and prompted him to write down, all that was\r\namiable, and pleasing to a mind like his. So far as the[ii.366] records\r\nand documents give us information, there is reason to apprehend, that\r\nMr. Noyes, like Stoughton, another old bachelor, never recovered his\r\nmind from the frame of feeling or conviction in which it was during the\r\nproceedings. His name is not found, as are those of other ministers, to\r\nany petitions, memorials or certificates, in favor of the sufferers\r\nduring the trials, or of reparation to their memories or to the\r\nfeelings of their friends. He does not appear to have taken any part in\r\narresting the delusion or rectifying the public mind.\r\n\r\nOf Cotton Mather, more is required to be said. He aspired to be\r\nconsidered the leading champion of the Church, and the most successful\r\ncombatant against the Satanic powers. He seems to have longed for an\r\nopportunity to signalize himself in this particular kind of warfare;\r\nseized upon every occurrence that would admit of such a coloring to\r\nrepresent it as the result of diabolical agency; circulated in his\r\nnumerous publications as many tales of witchcraft as he could collect\r\nthroughout New and Old England, and repeatedly endeavored to get up\r\ncases of the kind in Boston. There is some ground for suspicion that he\r\nwas instrumental in originating the fanaticism in Salem; at any rate,\r\nhe took a leading part in fomenting it. And while there is evidence\r\nthat he endeavored, after the delusion subsided, to escape the disgrace\r\nof having approved of the proceedings, and pretended to have been in\r\nsome measure opposed to them, it can be too clearly shown that he was\r\nsecretly and cunningly endeavoring to[ii.367] renew them during the\r\nnext year in his own parish in Boston.[E]\r\n\r\nHow blind is man to the future! The state of things which Cotton Mather\r\nlabored to bring about, in order that he might increase his own\r\ninfluence over an infatuated people, by being regarded by them as\r\nmighty[ii.368] to cast out and vanquish evil spirits, and as able to\r\nhold Satan himself in chains by his prayers and his piety, brought him\r\nat length into such disgrace that his power was broken down, and he\r\nbecame the object of public ridicule and open insult. And the\r\nexcitement that had been produced for the purpose of[ii.369] restoring\r\nand strengthening the influence of the clerical and spiritual leaders\r\nresulted in effects which reduced that influence to a still lower\r\npoint. The intimate connection of Dr. Mather and other prominent\r\nministers with the witchcraft delusion brought a reproach upon the\r\nclergy from which they have not yet recovered.[ii.370]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the designing exertions of ambitious ecclesiastics, and\r\nthe benevolent and praiseworthy efforts of those whose only aim was to\r\npromote a real and thorough reformation of religion, all the passions\r\nof our nature stood ready to throw their concentrated energy into the\r\nexcitement (as they are sure to do, whatever may be its character), so\r\nsoon as it became sufficiently strong to encourage their action.\r\n\r\nThe whole force of popular superstition, all the[ii.371] fanatical\r\npropensities of the ignorant and deluded multitude, united with the\r\nbest feelings of our nature to heighten the fury of the storm. Piety\r\nwas indignant at the supposed rebellion against the sovereignty of God,\r\nand was roused to an extreme of agitation and apprehension in\r\nwitnessing such a daring and fierce assault by the Devil and his\r\nadherents upon the churches and the cause of the gospel. Virtue was\r\nshocked at the tremendous guilt of those who were believed to have\r\nentered the diabolical confederacy; while public order and security\r\nstood aghast, amidst the invisible, the supernatural, the infernal, and\r\napparently the irresistible attacks that were making upon the\r\nfoundations of society. In baleful combination with principles, good in\r\nthemselves, thus urging the passions into wild operation, there were\r\nall the wicked and violent affections to which humanity is liable.\r\nTheological bitterness, personal animosities, local controversies,\r\nprivate feuds, long-cherished grudges, and professional jealousies,\r\nrushed forward, and raised their discordant voices, to swell the\r\nhorrible din; credulity rose with its monstrous and ever-expanding\r\nform, on the ruins of truth, reason, and the senses; malignity and\r\ncruelty rode triumphant through the storm, by whose fury every mild and\r\ngentle sentiment had been shipwrecked; and revenge, smiling in the\r\nmidst of the tempest, welcomed its desolating wrath as it dashed the\r\nmangled objects of its hate along the shore.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the prisoners, by the administra[ii.372]tive and\r\nsubordinate officers in charge of them, there is reason to apprehend,\r\nwas more than ordinarily harsh and unfeeling. The fate of Willard\r\nprevented expressions of kindness towards them. The crime of which they\r\nwere accused put them outside of the pale of human charities. All who\r\nbelieved them guilty looked upon them, not only with horror, but hate.\r\nTo have deliberately abandoned God and heaven, the salvation of Christ\r\nand the brotherhood of man, was regarded as detestable, execrable, and\r\nutterly and for ever damnable. This was the universal feeling at the\r\ntime when the fanaticism was at its height; or, if there were any\r\ndissenters, they dared not show themselves. What the poor innocent\r\nsufferers experienced of cruelty, wrong, and outrage from this cause,\r\nit is impossible for words to tell. It left them in prison to neglect,\r\nignominious ill-treatment, and abusive language from the menials having\r\ncharge of them; it made their trials a brutal mockery; it made the\r\npathway to the gallows a series of insults from an exasperated mob. If\r\ndear relatives or faithful friends kept near them, they did it at the\r\nperil of their lives, and were forbidden to utter the sentiments with\r\nwhich their hearts were breaking. There was no sympathy for those who\r\ndied, or for those who mourned.\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange to us, at this distance of time, and with the\r\nintelligence prevalent in this age, that persons of such known,\r\nestablished, and eminent reputation as many of those whose cases have\r\nbeen par[ii.373]ticularly noticed, could possibly have been imagined\r\nguilty of the crime imputed to them. The question arises in every mind,\r\nWhy did not their characters save them from conviction, and even from\r\nsuspicion? The answer is to be found in the peculiar views then\r\nentertained of the power and agency of Satan. It was believed that it\r\nwould be one of the signs of his coming to destroy the Church of\r\nChrist, that some of the \"elect\" would be seduced into his\r\nservice,—that he would drag captive in his chains, and pervert into\r\ninstruments to further his wicked cause, many who stood among the\r\nhighest in the confidence of Christians. This belief made them more\r\nvehement in their proceedings against ministers, church-members, and\r\npersons of good repute, who were proved, by the overwhelming evidence\r\nof the \"afflicted children\" and the confessing witches, to have made a\r\ncompact with the Devil. There is reason to fear that Mr. Burroughs, and\r\nall accused persons of the highest reputation before for piety and\r\nworth, especially all who had been professors of religion and\r\naccredited church-members, suffered more than others from the severity\r\nof the judges and executive officers of the law, and from the rage and\r\nhatred of the people. It was indeed necessary, in order to keep up the\r\ndelusion and maintain the authority of the prosecutions, to break down\r\nthe influence of those among the accused and the sufferers who had\r\nstood the highest, and bore themselves the best through the fiery\r\nordeal of the examinations, trials, and executions.[ii.374]\r\n\r\nIt is indeed a very remarkable fact, which has justly been enlarged\r\nupon by several who have had their attention turned to this subject,\r\nthat, of the whole number that suffered, none, in the final scene, lost\r\ntheir fortitude for a moment. Many were quite aged; a majority, women,\r\nof whom some, brought up in delicacy, were wholly unused to rough\r\ntreatment or physical suffering. They must have undergone the most\r\ndreadful hardships, suddenly snatched from their families and homes;\r\nexposed to a torrent of false accusations imputing to them the most\r\nodious, shameful, and devilish crimes; made objects of the abhorrence\r\nof their neighbors, and, through the notoriety of the affair, of the\r\nworld; carried to and fro, over rugged roads, from jail to jail, too\r\noften by unfeeling sub-officials; immured in crowded, filthy, and\r\nnoisome prisons; heavily loaded with chains, in dungeons; left to\r\nendure insufficient attention to necessary personal wants, often with\r\ninadequate food and clothing; all expressions of sympathy for them\r\nwithheld and forbidden,—those who ought to have been their comforters\r\ndenouncing them in the most awful language, and consigning them to the\r\ndoom of excommunication from the church on earth and from the hope of\r\nheaven. Surely, there have been few cases in the dark and mournful\r\nannals of human suffering and wrong, few instances of \"man's inhumanity\r\nto man,\" to be compared with what the victims of this tragedy endured.\r\nTheir bearing through the whole, from the arrest to the scaffold,\r\nreflects[ii.375] credit upon our common nature. The fact that Wardwell\r\nlost his firmness, for a time, ought not to exclude his name from the\r\nhonored list. Its claim to be enrolled on it was nobly retrieved by his\r\nrecantation, and his manly death.\r\n\r\nThere is one consideration that imparts a higher character to the\r\ndeportment of these persons than almost any of the tests to which the\r\nfirmness of the mind of man has ever been exposed. There was nothing\r\noutside of the mind to hold it up, but every thing to bear it down. All\r\nthat they had in this world, all on which they could rest a hope for\r\nthe next, was the consciousness of their innocence. Their fidelity to\r\nthis sense of innocence—for a lie would have saved them—their\r\nunfaltering allegiance to this consciousness; the preservation of a\r\ncalm, steadfast, serene mind; their faith and their prayers, rising\r\nabove the maledictions of a maniac mob, in devotion to God and\r\nforgiveness to men, and, as in the case of Martha Corey and George\r\nBurroughs, in clear and collected expressions,—this was truly sublime.\r\nIt was appreciated, at the time, by many a heart melted back to its\r\nhumanity; and paved the way for the deliverance of the world, we trust\r\nfor ever, from all such delusions, horrors, and spectacles. The\r\nsufferers in 1692 deserve to be held in grateful remembrance for having\r\nillustrated the dignity of which our nature is capable; for having\r\nshown that integrity of conscience is an armor which protects the peace\r\nof the soul against all the powers that can assail it; and for having\r\ngiven an[ii.376] example, that will be seen of all and in all times, of\r\na courage, constancy, and faithfulness of which all are capable, and\r\nwhich can give the victory over infirmities of age, weaknesses and\r\npains of body, and the most appalling combination of outrages to the\r\nmind and heart that can be accumulated by the violence and the wrath of\r\nman. Superstition and ignorance consigned their names to obloquy, and\r\nshrouded them in darkness. But the day has dawned; the shadows are\r\npassing away; truth has risen; the reign of superstition is over; and\r\njustice will be done to all who have been true to themselves, and stood\r\nfast to the integrity of their souls, even to the death.\r\n\r\nThe place selected for the executions is worthy of notice. It was at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the jail, and could be reached only by a\r\ncircuitous and difficult route. It is a fatiguing enterprise to get at\r\nit now, although many passages that approach it from some directions\r\nhave since been opened. But it was a point where the spectacle would be\r\nwitnessed by the whole surrounding country far and near, being on the\r\nbrow of the highest eminence in the vicinity of the town. As it was\r\nbelieved by the people generally that they were engaged in a great\r\nbattle with Satan, one of whose titles was \"the Prince of the Power of\r\nthe Air,\" perhaps they chose that spot to execute his confederates,\r\nbecause, in going to that high point, they were flaunting him in his\r\nface, celebrating their triumph over him in his own realm. There is no\r\ncontemporaneous nor immediately subsequent record, that[ii.377] the\r\nexecutions took place on the spot assigned by tradition; but that\r\ntradition has been uniform and continuous, and appears to be verified\r\nby a singular item of evidence that has recently come to light. A\r\nletter written by the late venerable Dr. Holyoke to a friend at a\r\ndistance, dated Salem, Nov. 25, 1791, has found its way back to the\r\npossession of one of his grand-daughters, which contains the following\r\npassage: \"In the last month, there died a man in this town, by the name\r\nof John Symonds, aged a hundred years lacking about six months, having\r\nbeen born in the famous '92. He has told me that his nurse had often\r\ntold him, that, while she was attending his mother at the time she lay\r\nin with him, she saw, from the chamber windows, those unhappy people\r\nhanging on Gallows' Hill, who were executed for witches by the delusion\r\nof the times.\" John Symonds lived and died near the southern end of\r\nBeverly Bridge, on the south side of what is now Bridge Street. He was\r\nburied from his house, and Dr. Bentley made the funeral prayer, in\r\nwhich he is said to have used this language: \"O God! the man who with\r\nhis own hands felled the trees, and hewed the timbers, and erected the\r\nhouse in which we are now assembled, was the ancestor of him whose\r\nremains we are about to inter.\" It is inferrible from this that Symonds\r\nwas born in the house from which he was buried. Gallows Hill, now\r\n\"Witch Hill\" is in full view from that spot, and would be from the\r\nchamber windows of a house there, at any time, even in the season when\r\nintervening trees were in their[ii.378] fullest foliage, while no other\r\npoint in that direction would be discernible. From the only other\r\nlocality of persons of the name of Symonds, at that time, in North\r\nFields near the North Bridge, Witch Hill is also visible, and the only\r\npoint in that direction that then would have been.\r\n\r\n\"Witch Hill\" is a part of an elevated ledge of rock on the western side\r\nof the city of Salem, broken at intervals; beginning at Legg's Hill,\r\nand trending northerly. The turnpike from Boston enters Salem through\r\none of the gaps in this ridge, which has been widened, deepened, and\r\ngraded. North of the turnpike, it rises abruptly to a considerable\r\nelevation, called \"Norman's Rocks.\" At a distance of between three and\r\nfour hundred feet, it sinks again, making a wide and deep gulley; and\r\nthen, about a third of a mile from the turnpike, it re-appears, in a\r\nprecipitous and, at its extremity, inaccessible cliff, of the height of\r\nfifty or sixty feet. Its southern and western aspect, as seen from the\r\nrough land north of the turnpike, is given in the headpiece of the\r\nThird Part, at the beginning of this volume. Its sombre and desolate\r\nappearance admits of little variety of delineation. It is mostly a bare\r\nand naked ledge. At the top of this cliff, on the southern brow of the\r\neminence, the executions are supposed to have taken place. The outline\r\nrises a little towards the north, but soon begins to fall off to the\r\ngeneral level of the country. From that direction only can the spot be\r\neasily reached. It is hard to climb the western side, impossible to\r\nclamber[ii.379] up the southern face. Settlement creeps down from the\r\nnorth, and has partially ascended the eastern acclivity, but can never\r\nreach the brink. Scattered patches of soil are too thin to tempt\r\ncultivation, and the rock is too craggy and steep to allow occupation.\r\nAn active and flourishing manufacturing industry crowds up to its base;\r\nbut a considerable surface at the top will for ever remain an open\r\nspace. It is, as it were, a platform raised high in air.\r\n\r\nA magnificent panorama of ocean, island, headland, bay, river, town,\r\nfield, and forest spreads out and around to view. On a clear summer\r\nday, the picture can scarcely be surpassed. Facing the sun and the sea,\r\nand the evidences of the love and bounty of Providence shining over the\r\nlandscape, the last look of earth must have suggested to the sufferers\r\na wide contrast between the mercy of the Creator and the wrath of his\r\ncreatures. They beheld the face of the blessed God shining upon them in\r\nhis works, and they passed with renewed and assured faith into his more\r\nimmediate presence. The elevated rock, uplifted by the divine hand,\r\nwill stand while the world stands, in bold relief, and can never be\r\nobscured by the encroachments of society or the structures of art,—a\r\nfitting memorial of their constancy.\r\n\r\nWhen, in some coming day, a sense of justice, appreciation of moral\r\nfirmness, sympathy for suffering innocence, the diffusion of refined\r\nsensibility, a discriminating discernment of what is really worthy of\r\ncommemoration among men, a rectified taste, a gen[ii.380]erous public\r\nspirit, and gratitude for the light that surrounds and protects us\r\nagainst error, folly, and fanaticism, shall demand the rearing of a\r\nsuitable monument to the memory of those who in 1692 preferred death to\r\na falsehood, the pedestal for the lofty column will be found ready,\r\nreared by the Creator on a foundation that can never be shaken while\r\nthe globe endures, or worn away by the elements, man, or time—the brow\r\nof Witch Hill. On no other spot could such a tribute be more worthily\r\nbestowed, or more conspicuously displayed.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the delusion upon the country at large were very\r\ndisastrous. It cast its shadows over a broad surface, and they darkened\r\nthe condition of generations. The material interests of the people long\r\nfelt its blight. Breaking out at the opening of the season, it\r\ninterrupted the planting and cultivating of the grounds. It struck an\r\nentire summer out of one year, and broke in upon another. The fields\r\nwere neglected; fences, roads, barns, and even the meeting-house, went\r\ninto disrepair. Burdens were accumulated upon the already over-taxed\r\nresources of the people. An actual scarcity of provisions, amounting\r\nalmost to a famine, continued for some time to press upon families.\r\nFarms were brought under mortgage or sacrificed, and large numbers of\r\nthe people were dispersed. One locality in the village, which was the\r\nscene of this wild and tragic fanaticism, bears to this day the marks\r\nof the blight then brought upon it. Although in the centre of a town\r\nexceeding almost[ii.381] all others in its agricultural development and\r\nthrift,—every acre elsewhere showing the touch of modern improvement\r\nand culture,—the \"old meeting-house road,\" from the crossing of the\r\nEssex Railroad to the point where it meets the road leading north from\r\nTapleyville, has to-day a singular appearance of abandonment. The\r\nSurveyor of Highways ignores it. The old, gray, moss-covered stone\r\nwalls are dilapidated, and thrown out of line. Not a house is on either\r\nof its borders, and no gate opens or path leads to any. Neglect and\r\ndesertion brood over the contiguous grounds. Indeed, there is but one\r\nhouse standing directly on the roadside until you reach the vicinity of\r\nthe site of the old meeting-house; and that is owned and occupied by a\r\nfamily that bear the name and are the direct descendants of Rebecca\r\nNurse. On both sides there are the remains of cellars, which declare\r\nthat once it was lined by a considerable population. Along this road\r\ncrowds thronged in 1692, for weeks and months, to witness the\r\nexaminations.\r\n\r\nThe ruinous results were not confined to the village, but extended more\r\nor less over the country generally. Excitement, wrought up to\r\nconsternation, spread everywhere. People left their business and\r\nfamilies, and came from distant points, to gratify their curiosity, and\r\nenable themselves to form a judgment of the character of the phenomena\r\nhere exhibited. Strangers from all parts swelled the concourse,\r\ngathered to behold the sufferings of \"the afflicted\" as manifested at\r\nthe examinations; and flocked to the surrounding[ii.382] eminences and\r\nthe grounds immediately in front of Witch Hill, to catch a view of the\r\nconvicts as they approached the place selected for their execution,\r\noffered their dying prayers, and hung suspended high in air. Such\r\nscenes always draw together great multitudes. None have possessed a\r\ndeeper, stronger, or stranger attraction; and never has the dread\r\nspectacle been held out to view over a wider area, or from so\r\nconspicuous a spot. The assembling of such multitudes so often, for\r\nsuch a length of time, and from such remote quarters, must have been\r\naccompanied and followed by wasteful, and in all respects deleterious,\r\neffects. The continuous or frequently repeated sessions of the\r\nmagistrates, grand jury, and jury of trials; and the attendance of\r\nwitnesses summoned from other towns, or brought from beyond the\r\njurisdiction of the Province, and of families and parties interested\r\nspecially in the proceedings,—must have occasioned an extensive and\r\nprotracted interruption of the necessary industrial pursuits of\r\nsociety, and heavily increased the public burdens.\r\n\r\nThe destruction dealt upon particular families extended to so many as\r\nto constitute in the aggregate a vast, wide-spread calamity.[F]\r\n[ii.383]\r\nThe facts that belong to the story of the witchcraft delusion of 1692,\r\nor that may in any way explain or illustrate it, so far as they can be\r\ngathered from the imperfect and scattered records and papers that have\r\ncome down to us, have now been laid before you. But there are one or\r\ntwo inquiries that force themselves upon thoughtful minds, which demand\r\nconsideration before we close the subject.[ii.384]\r\n\r\nWhat are we to think of those persons who commenced and continued the\r\naccusations,—the \"afflicted children\" and their associates?\r\n\r\nIn some instances and to some extent, the steps they took and the\r\ntestimony they bore may be explained by referring to the mysterious\r\nenergies of the imagination, the power of enthusiasm, the influence of\r\nsympathy, and the general prevalence of credulity,[ii.385] ignorance,\r\nsuperstition, and fanaticism at the time; and it is not probable, that,\r\nwhen they began, they had any idea of the tremendous length to which\r\nthey were finally led on.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps their original design to gratify a love of notoriety or\r\nof mischief by creating a sensation and excitement in their\r\nneighborhood, or, at the worst, to wreak their vengeance upon one or\r\ntwo individuals who had offended them. They soon, however, became\r\nintoxicated by the terrible success of their imposture, and were swept\r\nalong by the frenzy they had occasioned. It would be much more\r\ncongenial with our feelings to believe, that these misguided and\r\nwretched young persons early in the proceedings became themselves\r\nvictims of the delusion into which they plunged every one else. But we\r\nare forbidden to form this charitable judgment by the manifestations of\r\nart and contrivance, of deliberate cunning and cool malice, they\r\nexhibited to the end. Once or twice they were caught in their own\r\nsnare; and nothing but the blindness of the bewildered community saved\r\nthem from disgraceful exposure and well-deserved punishment. They\r\nappeared as the prosecutors of every poor creature that was tried, and\r\nseemed ready to bear testimony against any one upon whom suspicion\r\nmight happen to fall. It is dreadful to reflect upon the enormity of\r\ntheir wickedness, if they were conscious of imposture throughout. It\r\nseems to transcend the capabilities of human crime. There is, perhaps,\r\na slumbering element in the heart of man,[ii.386] that sleeps for ever\r\nin the bosom of the innocent and good, and requires the perpetration of\r\na great sin to wake it into action, but which, when once aroused,\r\nimpels the transgressor onward with increasing momentum, as the\r\ndescending ball is accelerated in its course. It may be that crime\r\nbegets an appetite for crime, which, like all other appetites, is not\r\nquieted but inflamed by gratification.\r\n\r\nTheir precise moral condition, the degree of guilt to be ascribed, and\r\nthe sentence to be passed upon them, can only be determined by a\r\nconsiderate review of all the circumstances and influences around them.\r\n\r\nFor a period embracing about two months, they had been in the habit of\r\nmeeting together, and spending the long winter evenings, at Mr.\r\nParris's house, practising the arts of fortune-telling, jugglery, and\r\nmagic. What they had heard in the traditions and fables of a credulous\r\nand superstitious age,—stories handed down in the interior settlements,\r\ncirculated in companies gathered around the hearths of farmhouses,\r\nindulging the excitements of terrified imaginations; filling each\r\nother's minds with wondrous tales of second-sight, ghosts and spirits\r\nfrom the unseen world, together with what the West-Indian or\r\nSouth-American slaves could add,—was for a long time the food of their\r\nfancies. They experimented continually upon what was the spiritualism\r\nof their day, and grew familiar with the imagery and the exhibitions of\r\nthe marvellous. The prevalent notions concerning witch[ii.387]craft\r\noperations and spectral manifestations came into full effect among\r\nthem. Living in the constant contemplation of such things, their minds\r\nbecame inflamed and bewildered; and, at the same time, they grew expert\r\nin practising and exhibiting the forms of pretended supernaturalism,\r\nthe conditions of diabolical distraction, and the terrors of\r\ndemonology. Apparitions rose before them, revealing the secrets of the\r\npast and of the future. They beheld the present spectres of persons\r\nthen bodily far distant. They declared in language, fits, dreams, or\r\ntrance, the immediate operations upon themselves of the Devil, by the\r\nagency of his confederates. Their sufferings, while thus under \"an evil\r\nhand,\" were dreadful to behold, and soon drew wondering and\r\nhorror-struck crowds around them.\r\n\r\nAt this point, if Mr. Parris, the ministers, and magistrates had done\r\ntheir duty, the mischief might have been stopped. The girls ought to\r\nhave been rebuked for their dangerous and forbidden sorceries and\r\ndivinations, their meetings broken up, and all such tamperings with\r\nalleged supernaturalism and spiritualism frowned down. Instead of this,\r\nthe neighboring ministers were summoned to meet at Mr. Parris's house\r\nto witness the extraordinary doings of the girls, and all they did was\r\nto indorse, and pray over, them. Countenance was thus given to their\r\npretensions, and the public confidence in the reality of their\r\nstatements established. Magistrates from the town, church-members,\r\nleading people, and people of all sorts, flocked to witness the awful\r\npower of Satan, as displayed in[ii.388] the tortures and contortions of\r\nthe \"afflicted children;\" who became objects of wonder, so far as their\r\nfeats were regarded, and of pity in view of their agonies and\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the evidence rather favors the supposition, that the\r\ngirls originally had no design of accusing, or bringing injury upon,\r\nany one. But the ministers at Parris's house, physicians and others,\r\nbegan the work of destruction by pronouncing the opinion that they were\r\nbewitched. This carried with it, according to the received doctrine, a\r\nconviction that there were witches about; for the Devil could not act\r\nexcept through the instrumentality of beings in confederacy with him.\r\nImmediately, the girls were beset by everybody to say who it was that\r\nbewitched them. Yielding to this pressure, they first cried out upon\r\nsuch persons as might have been most naturally suggested to them,—Sarah\r\nGood, apparently without a regular home, and wandering with her\r\nchildren from house to house for shelter and relief; Sarah Osburn, a\r\nmelancholy, broken-minded, bed-ridden person; and Tituba, a slave,\r\nprobably of mixed African and Indian blood. At the examination of these\r\npersons, the girls were first brought before the public, and the awful\r\npower in their hands revealed to them. The success with which they\r\nacted their parts; the novelty of the scene; the ceremonials of the\r\noccasion, the magistrates in their imposing dignity and authority, the\r\ntrappings of the marshal and his officers, the forms of proceeding,—all\r\nwhich they had never seen[ii.389] before; the notice taken of them; the\r\nimportance attached to them; invested the affair with a strange\r\nfascination in their eyes, and awakened a new class of sentiments and\r\nideas in their minds. A love of distinction and notoriety, and the\r\nseveral passions that are gratified by the expression by others of\r\nsympathy, wonder, and admiration, were brought into play. The fact that\r\nall eyes were upon them, with the special notice of the magistrates,\r\nand the entire confidence with which their statements were received,\r\nflattered and beguiled them. A fearful responsibility had been assumed,\r\nand they were irretrievably committed to their position. While they\r\nadhered to that position, their power was irresistible, and they were\r\nsure of the public sympathy and of being cherished by the public favor.\r\nIf they faltered, they would be the objects of universal execration and\r\nof the severest penalties of law for the wrongs already done and the\r\nfalsehoods already sworn to. There was no retracing their steps; and\r\ntheir only safety was in continuing the excitement they had raised. New\r\nvictims were constantly required to prolong the delusion, fresh fuel to\r\nkeep up the conflagration; and they went on to cry out upon others.\r\nWith the exception of two of their number, who appear to have indulged\r\nspite against the families in which they were servants, there is no\r\nevidence that they were actuated by private grievances or by\r\nanimosities personal to themselves. They were ready and sure to wreak\r\nvengeance upon any who expressed doubts about the truth of\r\ntheir[ii.390] testimony, or the propriety of the proceedings; but,\r\nbeyond this, they were very indifferent as to whom they should accuse.\r\nThey were willing, as to that matter, to follow the suggestions of\r\nothers, and availed themselves of all the gossip and slander and\r\nunfriendly talk in their families that reached their ears. It was\r\nfound, that a hint, with a little information as to persons, places,\r\nand circumstances, conveyed to them by those who had resentments and\r\ngrudges to gratify, would be sufficient for the purpose. There is\r\nreason to fear, that there were some behind them, giving direction to\r\nthe accusations, and managing the frightful machinery, all the way\r\nthrough. The persons who were apprehended had, to a considerable\r\nextent, been obnoxious, and subject to prejudice, in connection with\r\nquarrels and controversies related in Part I., vol. i. They were\r\n\"Topsfield men,\" or the opponents of Bayley or of Parris, or more or\r\nless connected with some other feuds. As further proof that the girls\r\nwere under the guidance of older heads, it is obvious, that there was,\r\nin the order of the proceedings, a skilful arrangement of times,\r\nsequences, and concurrents, that cannot be ascribed to them. No\r\nnovelist or dramatist ever laid his plot deeper, distributed his\r\ncharacters more artistically, or conducted more methodically the\r\nprogress of his story.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while, they were becoming every day more perfect in the\r\nperformance of their parts; and their imaginative powers, nervous\r\nexcitability, and flexibility and rapidity of muscular action, were\r\nkept[ii.391] under constant stimulus, and attaining a higher\r\ndevelopment. The effect of these things, so long continued in\r\nconnection with the perpetual pretence, becoming more or less imbued\r\nwith the character of belief, of their alliance and communion with\r\nspiritual beings and manifestations, may have unsettled, to some\r\nextent, their minds. Added to this, a sense of the horrid consequences\r\nof their actions, accumulating with every pang they inflicted, the\r\ninnocent blood they were shedding, and the depths of ruin into which\r\nthey were sinking themselves and others, not only demoralized, but to\r\nsome extent, perhaps, crazed them. It is truly a marvel that their\r\nphysical constitutions did not break down under the exhausting\r\nexcitements, the contortions of frame, the force to which the bodily\r\nfunctions were subjected in trances and fits, and the strain upon all\r\nthe vital energies, protracted through many months. The wonder,\r\nhowever, would have been greater, if the mental and moral balance had\r\nnot thereby been disturbed.\r\n\r\nPerpetual conversance with ideas of supernaturalism; daily and nightly\r\ncommunications, whether in the form of conscious imposture or honest\r\ndelusion, with the spiritual world, continued through a great length of\r\ntime,—as much at least as the exclusive contemplation of any one idea\r\nor class of ideas,—must be allowed to be unsalutary. Whatever keeps the\r\nthoughts wholly apart from the objects of real and natural life, and\r\nabsorbs them in abstractions, cannot be favorable to the soundness of\r\nthe faculties or the tone of the[ii.392] mind. This must especially be\r\nthe effect, if the subjects thus monopolizing the attention partake of\r\nthe marvellous and mysterious. When these things are considered, and\r\nthe external circumstances of the occasion, the wild social excitement,\r\nthe consternation, confusion, and horror, that were all crowded and\r\nheaped up and kept pressing upon the soul without intermission for\r\nmonths, the wonder is, indeed, that not only the accusers, prosecutors,\r\nand sufferers, but the whole people, did not lose their senses. Never\r\nwas the great boon of life, a sound mind in a sound body, more liable\r\nto be snatched away from all parties. The depositions of Ann Putnam,\r\nSr., have a tinge of sadness;—a melancholy, sickly mania running\r\nthrough them. Something of the kind is, perhaps, more or less\r\ndiscernible in the depositions of others.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, relieve our common nature from the load of the\r\nimputation, that, in its normal state, it is capable of such\r\ninconceivable wickedness, by giving to these wretched persons the\r\nbenefit of the supposition that they were more or less deranged. This\r\nview renders the lesson they present more impressive and alarming. Sin\r\nin all cases, when considered by a mind that surveys the whole field,\r\nis itself insanity. In the case of these accusers, it was so great as\r\nto prove, by its very monstrousness, that it had actually subverted\r\ntheir nature and overthrown their reason. They followed their victims\r\nto the gallows, and jeered, scoffed, insulted them in their dying\r\nhours. Sarah Churchill, according to the testimony of Sarah\r\nInger[ii.393]soll, on one occasion came to herself, and manifested the\r\nsymptoms of a restored moral consciousness: but it was a temporary\r\ngleam, a lucid interval; and she passed back into darkness, continuing,\r\nas before, to revel in falsehood, and scatter destruction around her.\r\nWith this single exception, there is not the slightest appearance of\r\ncompunction or reflection among them. On the contrary, they seem to\r\nhave been in a frivolous, sportive, gay frame of thought and spirits.\r\nThere is, perhaps, in this view of their conduct and demeanor,\r\nsomething to justify the belief that they were really demented. The\r\nfact that a large amount of skilful art and adroit cunning was\r\ndisplayed by them is not inconsistent with the supposition that they\r\nhad become partially insane; for such cunning and art are often\r\nassociated with insanity.\r\n\r\nThe quick wit and ready expedients of the \"afflicted children\" are very\r\nremarkable. They were prompt with answers, if any attempted to\r\ncross-examine them, extricated themselves most ingeniously if ever\r\nbrought into embarrassment, and eluded all efforts to entrap or expose\r\nthem. Among the papers is a deposition, the use of which at the trials\r\nis not apparent. It does not purport to bear upon any particular case.\r\nJoseph Hutchinson was a firm-minded man, of strong common sense. He\r\ncould not easily be deceived; and, although he took part in the\r\nproceedings at the beginning, soon became opposed to them. It looks as\r\nif, by close questions put to the child, Abigail Williams, on some\r\noccasion of his casually meeting her, he had tried[ii.394] to expose\r\nthe falseness of her accusations, and that he was made to put the\r\nconversation into the shape of a deposition. It is as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"The Deposition of Joseph Hutchinson, aged fifty-nine years, do testify\r\nas followeth: \"Abigail Williams, I have heard you speak often of a book\r\nthat has been offered to you. She said that there were two books: one\r\nwas a short, thick book; and the other was a long book. I asked her\r\nwhat color the book was of. She said the books were as red as blood. I\r\nasked her if she had seen the books opened. She said she had seen it\r\nmany times. I asked her if she did see any writing in the book. She\r\nsaid there were many lines written; and, at the end of every line,\r\nthere was a seal. I asked her, who brought the book to her. She told me\r\nthat it was the black man. I asked her who the black man was. She told\r\nme it was the Devil. I asked her if she was not afraid to see the\r\nDevil. She said, at the first she was, and did go from him; but now she\r\nwas not afraid, but could talk with him as well as she could with me.\"\r\n\r\nThere is an air of ease and confidence in the answers of Abigail, which\r\nillustrates the promptness of invention and assurance of their grounds\r\nwhich the girls manifested on all occasions. They were never at a loss,\r\nand challenged scrutiny. Hutchinson gained no advantage, and no one\r\nelse ever did, in an encounter with them.\r\n\r\nWhatever opinion may be formed of the moral or mental condition of the\r\n\"afflicted children,\" as to their sanity and responsibility, there can\r\nbe no doubt that they were great actors. In mere jugglery and[ii.395]\r\nsleight of hand, they bear no mean comparison with the workers of\r\nwonders, in that line, of our own day. Long practice had given them\r\ncomplete control over their countenances, intonations of voice, and the\r\nentire muscular and nervous organization of their bodies; so that they\r\ncould at will, and on the instant, go into fits and convulsions, swoon\r\nand fall to the floor, put their frames into strange contortions, bring\r\nthe blood to the face, and send it back again. They could be deadly\r\npale at one moment, at the next flushed; their hands would be clenched\r\nand held together as with a vice; their limbs stiff and rigid or wholly\r\nrelaxed; their teeth would be set; they would go through the paroxysms\r\nof choking and strangulation, and gasp for breath, bringing froth and\r\nblood from the mouth; they would utter all sorts of screams in\r\nunearthly tones; their eyes remain fixed, sometimes bereft of all light\r\nand expression, cold and stony, and sometimes kindled into flames of\r\npassion; they would pass into the state of somnambulism, without aim or\r\nconscious direction in their movements, looking at some point, where\r\nwas no apparent object of vision, with a wild, unmeaning glare. There\r\nare some indications that they had acquired the art of ventriloquism;\r\nor they so wrought upon the imaginations of the beholders, that the\r\nsounds of the motions and voices of invisible beings were believed to\r\nbe heard. They would start, tremble, and be pallid before apparitions,\r\nseen, of course, only by themselves; but their acting was so perfect\r\nthat all present thought they saw them too. They would[ii.396] address\r\nand hold colloquy with spectres and ghosts; and the responses of the\r\nunseen beings would be audible to the fancy of the bewildered crowd.\r\nThey would follow with their eyes the airy visions, so that others\r\nimagined they also beheld them. This was surely a high dramatic\r\nachievement. Their representations of pain, and every form and all the\r\nsigns and marks of bodily suffering,—as in the case of Ann Putnam's\r\narm, and the indentations of teeth on the flesh in many\r\ninstances,—utterly deceived everybody; and there were men present who\r\ncould not easily have been imposed upon. The Attorney-general was a\r\nbarrister fresh from Inns of Court in London. Deodat Lawson had seen\r\nsomething of the world; so had Joseph Herrick. Joseph Hutchinson was a\r\nsharp, stern, and sceptical observer. John Putnam was a man of great\r\npractical force and discrimination; so was his brother Nathaniel, and\r\nothers of the village. Besides, there were many from Boston and\r\nelsewhere competent to detect a trick; but none could discover any\r\nimposture in the girls. Sarah Nurse swore that she saw Goody Bibber\r\ncheat in the matter of the pins; but Bibber did not belong to the\r\nvillage, and was a bungling interloper. The accusing girls showed\r\nextraordinary skill, ingenuity, and fancy in inventing the stories to\r\nwhich they testified, and seemed to have been familiar with the imagery\r\nwhich belonged to the literature of demonology. This has led some to\r\nsuppose that they must have had access to books treating the subject.\r\nOur fathers abhorred, with a perfect hatred, all theatrical\r\nexhibitions. It would[ii.397] have filled them with horror to propose\r\ngoing to a play. But unwittingly, week after week, month in and month\r\nout, ministers, deacons, brethren, and sisters of the church rushed to\r\nNathaniel Ingersoll's, to the village and town meeting-houses, and to\r\nThomas Beadle's Globe Tavern, and gazed with wonder, awe, and\r\nadmiration upon acting such as has seldom been surpassed on the boards\r\nof any theatre, high or low, ancient or modern.\r\n\r\nThere is another aspect that perplexes and confounds the judgments of\r\nall who read the story. It is this: As it is at present the universal\r\nopinion that the whole of this witchcraft transaction was a delusion,\r\nhaving no foundation whatever but in the imaginations and passions; and\r\nas it is now certain, that all the accused, both the condemned and the\r\npardoned, were entirely innocent,—how can it be explained that so many\r\nwere led to confess themselves guilty? The answer to this question is\r\nto be found in those general principles which have led the wisest\r\nlegislators and jurists to the conclusion, that, although on their face\r\nand at first thought, they appear to be the very best kind of evidence,\r\nyet, maturely considered, confessions made under the hope of a benefit,\r\nand sometime even without the impulses of such a hope, are to be\r\nreceived with great caution and wariness. Here were fifty-five persons,\r\nwho declared themselves guilty of a capital, nay, a diabolical crime,\r\nof which we know they were innocent. It is probable that the motive of\r\nself-preservation influenced most of them. An[ii.398] awful death was\r\nin immediate prospect. There was no escape from the wiles of the\r\naccusers. The delusion had obtained full possession of the people, the\r\njury, and the Court. By acknowledging a compact with Satan, they could\r\nin a moment secure their lives and liberty. It was a position which\r\nonly the firmest minds could safely occupy. The principles and the\r\nprowess of ordinary characters could not withstand the temptation and\r\nthe pressure. They yielded, and were saved from an impending and\r\nterrible death.\r\n\r\nAs these confessions had a decisive effect in precipitating the public\r\nmind into the depths of its delusion, gave a fatal power to the\r\naccusers, and carried the proceedings to the horrible extremities which\r\nhave concentrated upon them the attention of the world, they assume an\r\nimportance in the history of the affair that demands a full and\r\nthorough exposition. At the examination of Ann Foster, at Salem\r\nVillage, on the 15th of July, 1692, the following confession was,\r\n\"after a while,\" extorted from her. It was undoubtedly the result of\r\nthe overwhelming effect of the horrors of her condition upon a\r\ndistressed and half-crazed mind. It shows the staple materials of which\r\nconfessions were made, and the forms of absurd superstition with which\r\nthe imaginations of people were then filled:—\r\n\r\nThe Devil appeared to her in the shape of a bird at several times,—such\r\na bird as she never saw the like before; and she had had this gift\r\n(viz., of striking the afflicted down with her eye) ever since. Being\r\nasked why she thought that bird was the Devil, she answered, because he\r\ncame[ii.399] white and vanished away black; and that the Devil told her\r\nshe should have this gift, and that she must believe him, and told her\r\nshe should have prosperity: and she said that he had appeared to her\r\nthree times, and always as a bird, and the last time about half a year\r\nsince, and sat upon a table,—had two legs and great eyes, and that it\r\nwas the second time of his appearance that he promised her prosperity.\r\nShe further stated, that it was Goody Carrier that made her a witch.\r\nShe told her, that, if she would not be a witch, the Devil would tear\r\nher to pieces, and carry her away,—at which time she promised to serve\r\nthe Devil; that she was at the meeting of the witches at Salem Village;\r\nthat Goody Carrier came, and told her of the meeting, and would have\r\nher go: so they got upon sticks, and went said journey, and, being\r\nthere, did see Mr. Burroughs, the minister, who spake to them all; that\r\nthere were then twenty-five persons met together; that she tied a knot\r\nin a rag, and threw it into the fire to hurt Timothy Swan, and that she\r\ndid hurt the rest that complained of her by squeezing puppets like\r\nthem, and so almost choked them; that she and Martha Carrier did both\r\nride on a stick or pole when they went to the witch-meeting at Salem\r\nVillage, and that the stick broke as they were carried in the air above\r\nthe tops of the trees, and they fell: but she did hang fast about the\r\nneck of Goody Carrier, and they were presently at the village; that she\r\nhad heard some of the witches say that there were three hundred and\r\nfive in the whole country, and that they would ruin that place, the\r\nvillage; that there were also present at that meeting two men besides\r\nMr. Burroughs, the minister, and one of them had gray hair; and that\r\nthe discourse among the witches at the meeting in Salem Village was,\r\nthat they would afflict there to set up the Devil's kingdom. [ii.400]\r\n\r\nThe confession of which the foregoing is the substance appears to have\r\nbeen drawn out at four several examinations on different days, during\r\nwhich she was induced by the influences around her to make her\r\ntestimony more and more extravagant at each successive examination. Her\r\ndaughter, Mary Lacy, called Goody Lacy, was brought up on the charge of\r\nwitchcraft at the same time; and, upon finding the mother confessing,\r\nshe saw that her only safety was in confessing also. When confronted,\r\nthe daughter cried out to the mother, \"We have forsaken Jesus Christ,\r\nand the Devil hath got hold of us. How shall we get clear of this Evil\r\nOne?\" She proceeded to say that she had accompanied her mother and\r\nGoody Carrier, all three riding together on the pole, to Salem Village.\r\nShe then made the following statement: \"About three or four years ago,\r\nshe saw Mistress Bradbury, Goody Howe, and Goody Nurse baptized by the\r\nold Serpent at Newbury Falls; that he dipped their heads in the water,\r\nand then said they were his, and he had power over them; that there\r\nwere six baptized at that time, who were some of the chief or higher\r\npowers, and that there might be near about a hundred in company at that\r\ntime.\" It being asked her \"after what manner she went to Newbury\r\nFalls,\" she answered, \"the Devil carried her in his arms.\" She said,\r\nthat, \"if she did take a rag, and roll it up together, and imagine it\r\nto represent such and such a person, then that, whatsoever she did to\r\nthat rag so rolled up, the person represented thereby would be[ii.401]\r\nin like manner afflicted.\" Her daughter, also named Mary Lacy, followed\r\nthe example of her mother and grandmother, and made confession.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the confessions shows, that, when accused persons\r\nmade up their minds to confess, they saw, that, to make their safety\r\nsecure, it was necessary to go the whole length of the popular\r\nsuperstition and fanaticism. In many instances, they appear to have\r\nfabricated their stories with much ingenuity and tact, making them\r\ntally with the statements of the accusers, adding points and items that\r\ngave an air of truthfulness, and falling in with current notions and\r\nfancies. They were undoubtedly under training by the girls, and were\r\nprovided with the materials of their testimony. Their depositions are\r\nvaluable, inasmuch as they enable us to collect about the whole of the\r\nnotions then prevalent on the subject. If, in delivering their\r\nevidences, any prompting was needed, the accusers were at their elbows,\r\nand helped them along in their stories. If, in any particular, they\r\nwere in danger of contradicting themselves or others, they were checked\r\nor diverted. In one case, a confessing witch was damaging her own\r\ntestimony, whereupon one of the afflicted cried out that she saw the\r\nshapes or apparitions of other witches interfering with her utterance.\r\nThe witness took the hint, pretended to have lost the power of\r\nexpressing herself, and was removed from the stand.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the confessing witches showed great adroitness, and\r\nknowledge of human nature. When[ii.402] a leading minister was visiting\r\nthem in the prison, one of them cried out as he passed her cell,\r\ncalling him by name, \"Oh! I remember a text you preached on in England,\r\ntwenty years since, from these words: 'Your sin will find you out;' for\r\nI find it to be true in my own case.\" This skilful compliment, showing\r\nthe power of his preaching making an impression which time could not\r\nefface, was no doubt flattering to the good man, and secured for her\r\nhis favorable influence.\r\n\r\nJustice requires that their own explanation of the influences which led\r\nthem to confess should not be withheld.\r\n\r\nThe following declaration of six women belonging to Andover is\r\naccompanied by a paper signed by more than fifty of the most\r\nrespectable inhabitants of that town, testifying to their good\r\ncharacter, in which it is said that \"by their sober, godly, and\r\nexemplary conversation, they have obtained a good report in the place,\r\nwhere they have been well esteemed and approved in the church of which\r\nthey are members:\"—\r\n\r\n\"We whose names are underwritten, inhabitants of Andover, when as that\r\nhorrible and tremendous judgment, beginning at Salem Village, in the\r\nyear 1692, by some called witchcraft, first breaking forth at Mr.\r\nParris's house, several young persons, being seemingly afflicted, did\r\naccuse several persons for afflicting them; and many there believing it\r\nso to be, we being informed, that, if a person was sick, the afflicted\r\nperson could tell what or who was the cause of that sickness: John\r\nBallard of Andover, his wife being[ii.403] sick at the same time, he,\r\neither from himself, or by the advice of others, fetched two of the\r\npersons called the afflicted persons from Salem Village to Andover,\r\nwhich was the beginning of that dreadful calamity that befell us in\r\nAndover, believing the said accusations to be true, sent for the said\r\npersons to come together to the meeting-house in Andover, the afflicted\r\npersons being there. After Mr. Barnard had been at prayer, we were\r\nblindfolded, and our hands were laid upon the afflicted persons, they\r\nbeing in their fits, and falling into their fits at our coming into\r\ntheir presence, as they said: and some led us, and laid our hands upon\r\nthem; and then they said they were well, and that we were guilty of\r\nafflicting them. Whereupon we were all seized as prisoners, by a\r\nwarrant from the justice of the peace, and forthwith carried to Salem;\r\nand by reason of that sudden surprisal, we knowing ourselves altogether\r\ninnocent of that crime, we were all exceedingly astonished and amazed,\r\nand consternated and affrighted, even out of our reason; and our\r\nnearest and dearest relations, seeing us in that dreadful condition,\r\nand knowing our great danger, apprehended there was no other way to\r\nsave our lives, as the case was then circumstanced, but by our\r\nconfessing ourselves to be such and such persons as the afflicted\r\nrepresented us to be, they, out of tenderness and pity, persuaded us to\r\nconfess what we did confess. And, indeed, that confession that it is\r\nsaid we made was no other than what was suggested to us by some\r\ngentlemen, they telling us that we were witches, and they knew it, and\r\nwe knew it, which made us think that it was so; and, our\r\nunderstandings, our reason, our faculties almost gone, we were not\r\ncapable of judging of our condition; as also the hard measures they\r\nused with us rendered us incapable of making our defence, but said any\r\nthing, and[ii.404] every thing which they desired, and most of what we\r\nsaid was but in effect a consenting to what they said. Some time after,\r\nwhen we were better composed, they telling us what we had confessed, we\r\ndid profess that we were innocent and ignorant of such things; and we\r\nhearing that Samuel Wardwell had renounced his confession, and was\r\nquickly after condemned and executed, some of us were told we were\r\ngoing after Wardwell.\r\n\r\n\"Mary Osgood.\r\nMary Tyler.\r\nDeliverance Dane.\r\nAbigail Barker.\r\nSarah Wilson.\r\nHannah Tyler.\"\r\n\r\nThe means employed, and the influences brought to bear upon persons\r\naccused, were, in many cases, such as wholly to overpower them, and to\r\nrelieve their confessions, to a great extent, of a criminal character.\r\nThey were scarcely responsible moral agents. In the month of October,\r\nIncrease Mather came to Salem, to confer with the confessing witches in\r\nprison. The result of his examinations is preserved in a document of\r\nwhich he is supposed to have been the author. The following extracts\r\nafford some explanation of the whole subject:—\r\n\r\n\"Goodwife Tyler did say, that, when she was first apprehended, she had\r\nno fears upon her, and did think that nothing could have made her\r\nconfess against herself. But since, she had found, to her great grief,\r\nthat she had wronged the truth, and falsely accused herself. She said\r\nthat, when she was brought to Salem, her brother Bridges rode with her;\r\nand that, all along the way from Andover to Salem,[ii.405] her brother\r\nkept telling her that she must needs be a witch, since the afflicted\r\naccused her, and at her touch were raised out of their fits, and urging\r\nher to confess herself a witch. She as constantly told him that she was\r\nno witch, that she knew nothing of witchcraft, and begged him not to\r\nurge her to confess. However, when she came to Salem, she was carried\r\nto a room, where her brother on one side, and Mr. John Emerson on the\r\nother side, did tell her that she was certainly a witch, and that she\r\nsaw the Devil before her eyes at that time (and, accordingly, the said\r\nEmerson would attempt with his hand to beat him away from her eyes);\r\nand they so urged her to confess, that she wished herself in any\r\ndungeon, rather than be so treated. Mr. Emerson told her, once and\r\nagain, 'Well, I see you will not confess! Well, I will now leave you;\r\nand then you are undone, body and soul, for ever.' Her brother urged\r\nher to confess, and told her that, in so doing, she could not lie: to\r\nwhich she answered, 'Good brother, do not say so; for I shall lie if I\r\nconfess, and then who shall answer unto God for my lie?' He still\r\nasserted it, and said that God would not suffer so many good men to be\r\nin such an error about it, and that she would be hanged if she did not\r\nconfess; and continued so long and so violently to urge and press her\r\nto confess, that she thought, verily, that her life would have gone\r\nfrom her, and became so terrified in her mind that she owned, at\r\nlength, almost any thing that they propounded to her; that she had\r\nwronged her conscience in so doing; she was guilty of a great sin in\r\nbelying of herself, and desired to mourn for it so long as she lived.\r\nThis she said, and a great deal more of the like nature; and all with\r\nsuch affection, sorrow, relenting, grief, and mourning, as that it\r\nexceeds any pen to describe and express the same.\"[ii.406]\r\n\r\n\"Goodwife Wilson said that she was in the dark as to some things in her\r\nconfession. Yet she asserted that, knowingly, she never had familiarity\r\nwith the Devil; that, knowingly, she never consented to the afflicting\r\nof any person, &c. However, she said that truly she was in the dark as\r\nto the matter of her being a witch. And being asked how she was in the\r\ndark, she replied, that the afflicted persons crying out of her as\r\nafflicting them made her fearful of herself; and that was all that made\r\nher say that she was in the dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"Goodwife Bridges said that she had confessed against herself things\r\nwhich were all utterly false; and that she was brought to her\r\nconfession by being told that she certainly was a witch, and so made to\r\nbelieve it,—though she had no other grounds so to believe.\"\r\n\r\nSome explanation of the details which those, prevailed upon to confess,\r\nput into their testimony, and which seemed, at the time, to establish\r\nand demonstrate the truth of their statements, is afforded by what Mary\r\nOsgood is reported, by Increase Mather, to have said to him on this\r\noccasion:—\r\n\r\n\"Being asked why she prefixed a time, and spake of her being baptized,\r\n&c., about twelve years since, she replied and said, that, when she had\r\nowned the thing, they asked the time, to which she answered that she\r\nknew not the time. But, being told that she did know the time, and must\r\ntell the time, and the like, she considered that about twelve years\r\nbefore (when she had her last child) she had a fit of sickness, and was\r\nmelancholy; and so thought that that time might be as proper a time to\r\nmention as any, and accordingly did prefix the said time. Being asked\r\nabout[ii.407] the cat, in the shape of which she had confessed that the\r\nDevil had appeared to her, &c., she replied, that, being told that the\r\nDevil had appeared to her, and must needs appear to her, &c. (she being\r\na witch), she at length did own that the Devil had appeared to her;\r\nand, being pressed to say in what creature's shape he appeared, she at\r\nlength did say that it was in the shape of a cat. Remembering that,\r\nsome time before her being apprehended, as she went out at her door,\r\nshe saw a cat, &c.; not as though she any whit suspected the said cat\r\nto be the Devil, in the day of it, but because some creature she must\r\nmention, and this came into her mind at that time.\"\r\n\r\nThis poor woman, as well as several others, besides Goodwife Tyler, who\r\ndenied and renounced their confessions, manifested, as Dr. Mather\r\naffirms, the utmost horror and anguish at the thought that they could\r\nhave been so wicked as to have belied themselves, and brought injury\r\nupon others by so doing. They \"bewailed and lamented their accusing of\r\nothers, about whom they never knew any evil\" in their lives. They\r\nproved the sincerity of their repentance by abandoning and denouncing\r\ntheir confessions, and thus offering their lives as a sacrifice to\r\natone for their falsehood. They were then awaiting their trial; and\r\nthere seemed no escape from the awful fate which had befallen all\r\npersons brought to trial before, and who had not confessed or had\r\nwithdrawn their confession. Fortunately for them, the Court did not\r\nmeet again in 1692; and they were acquitted at the regular session, in\r\nthe January following.[ii.408]\r\n\r\nIn one of Calef's tracts, he sums up his views, on the subject of the\r\nconfessions, as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"Besides the powerful argument of life (and freedom from hardships, not\r\nonly promised, but also performed to all that owned their guilt), there\r\nare numerous instances of the tedious examinations before private\r\npersons, many hours together; they all that time urging them to confess\r\n(and taking turns to persuade them), till the accused were wearied out\r\nby being forced to stand so long, or for want of sleep, &c., and so\r\nbrought to give assent to what they said; they asking them, 'Were you\r\nat such a witch meeting?' or, 'Have you signed the Devil's book?' &c.\r\nUpon their replying 'Yes,' the whole was drawn into form, as their\r\nconfession.\"\r\n\r\nThis accounts for the similarity of construction and substance of the\r\nconfessions generally.\r\n\r\nCalef remarks:—\r\n\r\n\"But that which did mightily further such confessions was their nearest\r\nrelations urging them to it. These, seeing no other way of escape for\r\nthem, thought it the best advice that could be given; hence it was,\r\nthat the husbands of some, by counsel, often urging, and utmost\r\nearnestness, and children upon their knees intreating, have at length\r\nprevailed with them to say they were guilty.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most painful things in the whole affair was, that the\r\nabsolute conviction of the guilt of the persons accused, pervading the\r\ncommunity, took full effect upon the minds of many relatives and\r\nfriends. They did not consider it as a matter of the least possible\r\ndoubt. They therefore looked upon it as wicked[ii.409] obstinacy not to\r\nconfess, and, in this sense, an additional and most conclusive evidence\r\nof a mind alienated from truth and wholly given over to Satan. This\r\nturned natural love and previous friendships into resentment,\r\nindignation, and abhorrence, which left the unhappy prisoners in a\r\ncondition where only the most wonderful clearness of conviction and\r\nstrength of character could hold them up. And, in many cases where they\r\nyielded, it was not from unworthy fear, or for self-preservation, but\r\nbecause their judgment was overthrown, and their minds in complete\r\nsubjection and prostration.\r\n\r\nThere can, indeed, hardly be a doubt, that, in some instances, the\r\nconfessing persons really believed themselves guilty. To explain this,\r\nwe must look into the secret chambers of the human soul; we must read\r\nthe history of the imagination, and consider its power over the\r\nunderstanding. We must transport ourselves to the dungeon, and think of\r\nits dark and awful walls, its dreary hours, its tedious loneliness, its\r\nheavy and benumbing fetters and chains, its scanty fare, and all its\r\ndismal and painful circumstances. We must reflect upon their influence\r\nover a terrified and agitated, an injured and broken spirit. We must\r\nthink of the situation of the poor prisoner, cut off from hope; hearing\r\nfrom all quarters, and at all times, morning, noon, and night, that\r\nthere is no doubt of his guilt; surrounded and overwhelmed by\r\naccusations and evidence, gradually but insensibly mingling and\r\nconfounding the visions and vagaries of his troubled[ii.410] dreams\r\nwith the reveries of his waking hours, until his reason becomes\r\nobscured, his recollections are thrown into derangement, his mind loses\r\nthe power of distinguishing between what is perpetually told him by\r\nothers and what belongs to the suggestions of his own memory: his\r\nimagination at last gains complete ascendency over his other faculties,\r\nand he believes and declares himself guilty of crimes of which he is as\r\ninnocent as the child unborn. The history of the transaction we have\r\nbeen considering, affords a clear illustration of the truth and\r\nreasonableness of this explanation.\r\n\r\nThe facility with which persons can be persuaded, by perpetually\r\nassailing them with accusations of the truth of a charge, in reality\r\nnot true, even when it is made against themselves, has been frequently\r\nnoticed. Addison, in one of the numbers of his \"Spectator,\" speaks of\r\nit in connection with our present subject: \"When an old woman,\" says\r\nhe, \"begins to dote, and grow chargeable to a parish, she is generally\r\nturned into a witch, and fills the whole country with extravagant\r\nfancies, imaginary distempers, and terrifying dreams. In the mean time,\r\nthe poor wretch that is the innocent occasion of so many evils begins\r\nto be frighted at herself, and sometimes confesses secret commerces and\r\nfamiliarities that her imagination forms in a delirious old age. This\r\nfrequently cuts off charity from the greatest objects of compassion,\r\nand inspires people with a malevolence towards those poor, decrepit\r\nparts of our species[ii.411] in whom human nature is defaced by\r\ninfirmity and dotage.\"\r\n\r\nThis passage is important, in addition to the bearing it has upon the\r\npoint we have been considering, as describing the state of opinion and\r\nfeeling in England twenty years after the folly had been exploded here.\r\nIn another number of the same series of essays, he bears evidence, that\r\nthe superstitions which here came to a head in 1692 had long been\r\nprevalent in the mother-country: \"Our forefathers looked upon nature\r\nwith more reverence and horror before the world was enlightened by\r\nlearning and philosophy, and loved to astonish themselves with the\r\napprehensions of witchcraft, prodigies, charms, and enchantments. There\r\nwas not a village in England that had not a ghost in it; the\r\nchurchyards were all haunted; every large common had a circle of\r\nfairies belonging to it; and there was scarce a shepherd to be met with\r\nwho had not seen a spirit.\" These fancies still linger in the minds of\r\nsome in the Old World and in the New.\r\n\r\nAfter allowing for the utmost extent of prevalent superstitions, the\r\nexaggerations incident to a state of general excitement, and the\r\nfertile inventive faculties of the accusing girls, there is much in the\r\nevidence that cannot easily be accounted for. In other cases than that\r\nof Westgate, we find the symptoms of that bewildered condition of the\r\nsenses and imagination not at all surprising or unusual in the\r\nexperience of men staggering home in midnight hours from tavern haunts.\r\nDisturbed dreams were, it is[ii.412] not improbable, a fruitful source\r\nof delusion. A large part of the evidence is susceptible of explanation\r\nby the supposition, that the witnesses had confounded the visions of\r\ntheir sleeping, with the actual observations and occurrences of their\r\nwaking hours. At the trial of Susanna Martin, it was in evidence, that\r\none John Kembal had agreed to purchase a puppy from the prisoner, but\r\nhad afterwards fallen back from his bargain, and procured a puppy from\r\nsome other person, and that Martin was heard to say, \"If I live, I will\r\ngive him puppies enough.\" The circumstances seem to me to render it\r\nprobable, that the following piece of evidence given by Kembal, and to\r\nwhich the Court attached great weight, was the result of a nightmare\r\noccasioned by his apprehension and dread of the fulfilment of the\r\nreported threat:—\r\n\r\n\"I, this deponent, coming from his intended house in the woods to\r\nEdmund Elliot's house where I dwelt, about the sunset or presently\r\nafter; and there did arise a little black cloud in the north-west, and\r\na few drops of rain, and the wind blew pretty hard. In going between\r\nthe house of John Weed and the meeting-house, this deponent came by\r\nseveral stumps of trees by the wayside; and he by impulse he can give\r\nno reason of, that made him tumble over the stumps one after another,\r\nthough he had his axe upon his shoulder which put him in much danger,\r\nand made him resolved to avoid the next, but could not.\r\n\r\n\"And, when he came a little below the meeting-house, there did appear a\r\nlittle thing like a puppy, of a darkish color. It shot between my legs\r\nforward and backward, as[ii.413] one that were dancing the hay.[G] And\r\nthis deponent, being free from all fear, used all possible endeavors to\r\ncut it with his axe, but could not hurt it; and, as he was thus\r\nlaboring with his axe, the puppy gave a little jump from him, and\r\nseemed to go into the ground.\r\n\r\n\"In a little further going, there did appear a black puppy, somewhat\r\nbigger than the first, but as black as a coal to his apprehension,\r\nwhich came against him with such violence as its quick motions did\r\nexceed his motions of his axe, do what he could. And it flew at his\r\nbelly, and away, and then at his throat and over his shoulder one way,\r\nand go off, and up at it again another way; and with such quickness,\r\nspeed, and violence did it assault him, as if it would tear out his\r\nthroat or his belly. A good while, he was without fear; but, at last, I\r\nfelt my heart to fail and sink under it, that I thought my life was\r\ngoing out. And I recovered myself, and gave a start up, and ran to the\r\nfence, and calling upon God and naming the name Jesus Christ, and then\r\nit invisibly away. My meaning is, it ceased at once; but this deponent\r\nmade it not known to anybody, for fretting his wife.\"[H]\r\n\r\n[ii.414] We are all exposed to the danger of confounding the\r\nimpressions left by the imagination, when, set free from all\r\nconfinement, it runs wild in dreams, with the actual experiences of\r\nwakeful faculties in real life. It is a topic worthy the consideration\r\nof writers on evidence, and of legal tribunals. So also is the effect,\r\nupon the personal consciousness, of the continued[ii.415] repetition of\r\nthe same story, or of hearing it repeated by others. Instances are\r\ngiven in books,—perhaps can be recalled by our own individual\r\nexperience or observation,—in which what was originally a\r\ndelibe[ii.416]rate fabrication of falsehood or of fancy has come, at\r\nlast, to be regarded as a veritable truth and a real occurrence.\r\n\r\nA thorough and philosophical treatise on the subject of evidence is, in\r\nview of these considerations, much needed. The liability all men are\r\nunder to confound the fictions of their imaginations with the realities\r\nof actual observation is not understood with sufficient clearness by\r\nthe community; and, so long as it is not understood and regarded,\r\nserious mistakes and inconveniences will be apt to occur in seasons of\r\ngeneral excitement. We are still disposed to attribute more importance\r\nthan we ought to strong convictions, without stopping to inquire\r\nwhether they may not be in reality delusions of the understanding. The\r\ncause of truth demands a more thorough examination of this whole\r\nsubject. The visions that appeared before the mind of the celebrated\r\nColonel Gardiner are still regarded by the generality of pious people\r\nas evidence of miraculous interposition, while, just so far as they are\r\nevidence to that point, so far is the authority of Christianity\r\noverthrown; for it is a fact, that Lord Herbert of Cherbury believed\r\nwith equal sincerity and confidence that he had been vouchsafed a\r\nsimilar vision sanctioning his labors, when about to publish what has\r\nbeen pronounced one of the most powerful attacks ever made upon our\r\nreligion. It is dangerous to advance arguments in favor of any cause\r\nwhich may be founded upon nothing better than the reveries of an ardent\r\nimagination![ii.417]\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of dreams, of the exercises and convictions which occupy\r\nthe mind, while the avenues of the senses are closed, and the soul is\r\nmore or less extricated from its connection with the body, particularly\r\nin the peculiar conditions of partial slumber, are among the deep\r\nmysteries of human experience. The writers on mental philosophy have\r\nnot given them the attention they deserve.\r\n\r\nThe testimony in these trials is particularly valuable as showing the\r\npower of the imagination to completely deceive and utterly falsify the\r\nsenses of sober persons, when wide awake and in broad daylight. The\r\nfollowing deposition was given in Court under oath. The parties\r\ntestifying were of unquestionable respectability. The man was probably\r\na brother of James Bayley, the first minister of the Salem Village\r\nparish.\r\n\r\n\"The Deposition of Joseph Bayley, aged forty-four years.—Testifieth and\r\nsaith, that, on the twenty-fifth day of May last, myself and my wife\r\nbeing bound to Boston, on the road, when I came in sight of the house\r\nwhere John Procter did live, there was a very hard blow struck on my\r\nbreast, which caused great pain in my stomach and amazement in my head,\r\nbut did see no person near me, only my wife behind me on the same\r\nhorse; and, when I came against said Procter's house, according to my\r\nunderstanding, I did see John Procter and his wife at said house.\r\nProcter himself looked out of the window, and his wife did stand just\r\nwithout the door. I told my wife of it; and she did look that way, and\r\ncould see nothing but a little maid at[ii.418] the door. Afterwards,\r\nabout half a mile from the aforesaid house, I was taken speechless for\r\nsome short time. My wife did ask me several questions, and desired me,\r\nthat, if I could not speak, I should hold up my hand; which I did, and\r\nimmediately I could speak as well as ever. And, when we came to the way\r\nwhere Salem road cometh into Ipswich road, there I received another\r\nblow on my breast, which caused so much pain that I could not sit on my\r\nhorse. And, when I did alight off my horse, to my understanding, I saw\r\na woman coming towards us about sixteen or twenty pole from us, but did\r\nnot know who it was: my wife could not see her. When I did get up on my\r\nhorse again, to my understanding, there stood a cow where I saw the\r\nwoman. After that, we went to Boston without any further molestation;\r\nbut, after I came home again to Newbury, I was pinched and nipped by\r\nsomething invisible for some time: but now, through God's goodness to\r\nme, I am well again.—_Jurat in curia_ by both persons.\"\r\n\r\nBayley and his wife were going to Boston on election week. It was a\r\ngood two days' journey from Newbury, as the roads then were, and riding\r\nas they did. According to the custom of the times, she was mounted on a\r\npillion behind him. They had probably passed the night at the house of\r\nSergeant Thomas Putnam, with whom he was connected by marriage. It was\r\nat the height of the witchcraft delirium. Thomas Putnam's house was the\r\nvery focus of it. There they had listened to highly wrought accounts of\r\nits wonders and terrors, had witnessed the amazing phenomena exhibited\r\nby Ann Putnam and Mercy Lewis, and their minds been filled with images\r\nof[ii.419] spectres of living witches, and ghosts of the dead. They had\r\nseen with their own eyes the tortures of the girls under cruel\r\ndiabolical influence, of which they had heard so much, and realized the\r\ndread outbreak of Satan and his agents upon the lives and souls of men.\r\n\r\nThey started the next morning on their way through the gloomy woods and\r\nover the solitary road. It was known that they were to pass the house\r\nof John Procter, believed to be a chief resort of devilish spirits.\r\nOppressed with terror and awe, Bayley was on the watch, his heart in\r\nhis mouth. The moment he came in sight, his nervous agitation reached\r\nits climax; and he experienced the shock he describes. When he came\r\nopposite to the house, to his horror there was Procter looking at him\r\nfrom the window, and Procter's wife standing outside of the door. He\r\nknew, that, in their proper persons and natural bodies, they were, at\r\nthat moment, both of them, and had been, for six weeks, in irons, in\r\none of the cells of the jail at Boston. Bayley's wife, from her\r\nposition on the pillion behind him, had her face directed to the other\r\nside of the road. He told her what he saw. She looked round to the\r\nhouse, and could see nothing but a little maid at the door. After one\r\nor two more fits of fright, he reached the Lynn road, had escaped from\r\nthe infernal terrors of the infected region, and his senses resumed\r\ntheir natural functions. It was several days before his nervous\r\nagitations ceased. Altogether, this is a remarkable case of\r\nhallucination:[ii.420] showing that the wildest fancies brought before\r\nthe mind in dreams may be paralleled in waking hours; and that mental\r\nexcitement may, even then, close the avenues of the senses, exclude the\r\nperception of reality, and substitute unsubstantial visions in the\r\nplace of actual and natural objects.\r\n\r\nThere may be an interest in some minds to know who the \"little maid at\r\nthe door\" was. The elder children of John Procter were either married\r\noff, or lived on his farm at Ipswich, with the exception of Benjamin,\r\nhis oldest son, who remained with his father on the Salem farm.\r\nBenjamin had been imprisoned two days before Bayley passed the house.\r\nFour days before, Sarah, sixteen years of age, had also been arrested,\r\nand committed to jail. This left only William, eighteen years of age,\r\nwho, three days after, was himself put into prison; Samuel, seven;\r\nAbigail, between three and four years of age; and one still younger. No\r\nfemale of the family was then at the house older than Abigail. This\r\npoor deserted child was \"the little maid.\" Curiosity to see the passing\r\nstrangers, or possibly the hope that they might be her father and\r\nmother, or her brother and sister, brought her to the door.\r\n\r\nIn the terrible consequences that resulted from the mischievous, and\r\nperhaps at the outset merely sportive, proceedings of the children in\r\nMr. Parris's family, we have a striking illustration of the principle,\r\nthat no one can foretell, with respect either to himself or others, the\r\nextent of the suffering and injury that may[ii.421] be occasioned by\r\nthe least departure from truth, or from the practice of deception. In\r\nthe horrible succession of crimes through which those young persons\r\nwere led to pass, in the depth of depravity to which they were thrown,\r\nwe discern the fate that endangers all who enter upon a career of\r\nwickedness.\r\n\r\nNo one can have an adequate knowledge of the human mind, who has not\r\ncontemplated its developments in scenes like those that have now been\r\nrelated. It may be said of the frame of our spiritual, even with more\r\nemphasis than of our corporeal nature, that we are fearfully and\r\nwonderfully made. In the maturity of his bodily and mental\r\norganization, health gliding through his veins, strength and symmetry\r\nclothing his form, intelligence beaming from his countenance, and\r\nimmortality stamped on his brow, man is indeed the noblest work of God.\r\nIn the degradation and corruption to which he can descend, he is the\r\nmost odious and loathsome object in the creation. The human mind, when\r\nall its faculties are fully developed and in proper proportions, reason\r\nseated on its rightful throne and shedding abroad its light, memory\r\nembracing the past, hope smiling upon the future, faith leaning on\r\nHeaven, and the affections diffusing through all their gentle warmth,\r\nis worthy of its source, deserves its original title of \"image of God,\"\r\nand is greater and better than the whole material universe. It is\r\nnobler than all the works of God; for it is an emanation, a part of God\r\nhimself, \"a ray from the fountain of light.\" But where, I[ii.422] ask,\r\ncan you find a more deplorable and miserable object than the mind in\r\nruins, tossed by its own rebellious principles, and distorted by the\r\nmonstrously unequal development of its faculties? You will look in vain\r\nupon the earthquake, the volcano, or the hurricane, for those elements\r\nof the awful and terrible which are manifested in a community of men\r\nwhose passions have trampled upon their principles, whose imaginations\r\nhave overthrown the government of reason, and who are swept along by\r\nthe torrent until all order and security are swallowed up and lost.\r\nSuch a spectacle we have now been witnessing. We have seen the whole\r\npopulation of this place and vicinity yielding to the sway of their\r\ncredulous fancies, allowing their passions to be worked up to a\r\ntremendous pitch of excitement, and rushing into excesses of folly and\r\nviolence that have left a stain on their memory, and will awaken a\r\nsense of shame, pity, and amazement in the minds of their latest\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more mysterious than the self-deluding power of the\r\nmind, and there never were scenes in which it was more clearly\r\ndisplayed than the witchcraft prosecutions. Honest men testified, with\r\nperfect confidence and sincerity, to the most absurd impossibilities;\r\nwhile those who thought themselves victims of diabolical influence\r\nwould actually exhibit, in their corporeal frames, all the appropriate\r\nsymptoms of the sufferings their imaginations had brought upon them.\r\nGreat ignorance prevailed in reference to the influences of the body\r\nand the mind[ii.423] upon each other. While the imagination was called\r\ninto a more extensive and energetic action than at any succeeding or\r\nprevious period, its properties and laws were but little understood:\r\nthe extent of the connection of the will and the muscular system, the\r\nreciprocal influence of the nerves and the fancy, and the strong and\r\nuniversally pervading sympathy between our physical and moral\r\nconstitutions, were almost wholly unknown. These important subjects,\r\nindeed, are but imperfectly understood at the present day.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be affirmed, that the relations of the human mind with\r\nthe spiritual world will never be understood while we continue in the\r\npresent stage of existence and mode of being. The error of our\r\nancestors—and it is an error into which men have always been prone to\r\nfall, and from which our own times are by no means exempt—was in\r\nimagining that their knowledge had extended, in this direction, beyond\r\nthe boundary fixed unalterably to our researches, while in this\r\ncorporeal life.\r\n\r\nIt admits of much question, whether human science can ever find a solid\r\nfoundation in what relates to the world of spirits. The only instrument\r\nof knowledge we can here employ is language. Careful thinkers long ago\r\ncame to the conclusion, that it is impossible to frame a language\r\nprecisely and exclusively adapted to convey abstract and spiritual\r\nideas, even if it is possible, as some philosophers have denied, for\r\nthe mind, in its present state, to have such ideas. All[ii.424]\r\nattempts to construct such a language, though made by the most\r\ningenious men, have failed. Language is based upon imagery, and\r\nassociations drawn from so much of the world as the senses disclose to\r\nus; that is, from material objects and their relations. We are here\r\nconfined, as it were, within narrow walls. We can catch only glimpses\r\nof what is above and around us, outside of those walls. Such glimpses\r\nmay be vouchsafed, from time to time, to rescue us from sinking into\r\nmaterialism, and to keep alive our faith in scenes of existence\r\nremaining to be revealed when the barriers of our imprisonment shall be\r\ntaken down, and what we call death lift us to a clearer and broader\r\nvision of universal being.\r\n\r\nOf the reality of the spiritual world, we are assured by consciousness\r\nand by faith; but our knowledge of that world, so far as it can go into\r\nparticulars, or become the subject of definition or expression, extends\r\nno further than revelation opens the way. In all ages, men have been\r\nawakened to the \"wonders of the invisible world;\" but they remain\r\n\"wonders\" still. Nothing like a permanent, stable, or distinct science\r\nhas ever been achieved in this department. Man and God are all that are\r\nplaced within our ken. Metaphysics and Theology are the names given to\r\nthe sciences that relate to them. The greater the number of books\r\nwritten by human learning and ingenuity to expound them, the more\r\nadvanced the intelligence and piety of mankind, the less, it is\r\nconfessed, do we know of them in detail, the more they rise above our\r\ncomprehension,[ii.425] the more unfathomable become their depths.\r\nExperience, history, the progress of light, all increase our sense of\r\nthe impossibility of estimating the capacities of the human soul. So\r\nalso we find that the higher we rise towards the Deity, in the\r\ncontemplation of his works and word, the more does he continue to\r\ntranscend our power to describe or imagine his greatness and glory. The\r\nrevelation which the Saviour brought to mankind is all that the heart\r\nof man need desire, or the mind of man can comprehend. We are God's\r\nchildren, and he is our Father. That is all; and, the wiser and better\r\nwe become, the more we are convinced and satisfied that it is enough.\r\n\r\nThere are, undoubtedly, innumerable beings in the world of spirits,\r\nbesides departed souls, the Redeemer, and the Father. But of such\r\nbeings we have, while here, no absolute and specific knowledge. In\r\nevery age, as well as in our own, there have been persons who have\r\nbelieved themselves to hold communication with unseen spirits. The\r\nmethods of entering into such communication have been infinitely\r\ndiversified, from the incantations of ancient sorcery to the mediums\r\nand rappings of the present day. In former periods, particularly where\r\nthe belief of witchcraft prevailed, it was thought that such\r\ncommunications could be had only with evil spirits, and, mostly, with\r\nthe Chief of evil spirits. They were accordingly treated as criminal,\r\nand made the subject of the severest penalties known to the law. In our\r\nday, no such penalties are attached to the practice of seeking\r\nspiritual com[ii.426]munications. Those who have a fancy for such\r\nexperiments are allowed to amuse themselves in this way without\r\nreproach or molestation. It is not charged upon them that they are\r\ndealing with the Evil One or any of his subordinates. They do not\r\nimagine such a thing themselves. I have no disposition, at any time, in\r\nany given case, to dispute the reality of the wonderful stories told in\r\nreference to such matters. All that I am prompted ever to remark is,\r\nthat, if spirits do come, as is believed, at the call of those who seek\r\nto put themselves into communication with them, there is no evidence, I\r\nventure to suggest, that they are good spirits. I have never heard of\r\ntheir doing much good, substantially, to any one. No important truth\r\nhas been revealed by them, no discovery been made, no science had its\r\nfield enlarged; no department of knowledge has been brought into a\r\nclearer light; no great interest has been promoted; no movement of\r\nhuman affairs, whether in the action of nations or the transactions of\r\nmen, has been advanced or in any way facilitated; no impulse has been\r\ngiven to society, and no elevation to life and character. It may be\r\nthat the air is full of spiritual beings, hovering about us; but all\r\nexperience shows that no benefit can be derived from seeking their\r\nintervention to share with us the duties or the burdens of our present\r\nprobation. The mischiefs which have flowed from the belief that they\r\ncan operate upon human affairs, and from attempting to have dealings\r\nwith them, have been illustrated in the course of our narrative. In\r\nthis view of the sub[ii.427]ject, no law is needed to prevent real or\r\npretended communication with invisible beings. Enlightened reflection,\r\ncommon sense, natural prudence, would seem to be sufficient to keep men\r\nfrom meddling at all with practices, or countenancing notions, from\r\nwhich all history proclaims that no good has ever come, but\r\nincalculable evil flowed.\r\n\r\nFor the conduct of life, while here in these bodies, we must confine\r\nour curiosity to fields of knowledge open to our natural and ordinary\r\nfaculties, and embraced within the limits of the established condition\r\nof things. Our fathers filled their fancies with the visionary images\r\nof ghosts, demons, apparitions, and all other supposed forms and\r\nshadows of the invisible world; lent their ears to marvellous stories\r\nof communications with spirits; gave to supernatural tales of\r\nwitchcraft and demonology a wondering credence, and allowed them to\r\noccupy their conversation, speculations, and reveries. They carried a\r\nbelief of such things, and a proneness to indulge it, into their daily\r\nlife, their literature, and the proceedings of tribunals,\r\necclesiastical and civil. The fearful results shrouded their annals in\r\ndarkness and shame. Let those results for ever stand conspicuous,\r\nbeacon-monuments warning us, and coming generations, against\r\nsuperstition in every form, and all credulous and vain attempts to\r\npenetrate beyond the legitimate boundaries of human knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of the real world, so far as science discloses them to\r\nour contemplation; the records of[ii.428] actual history; the lessons\r\nof our own experience; the utterances of the voice within, audible only\r\nto ourselves; and the teachings of the Divine Word,—are sufficient for\r\nthe exercise of our faculties and the education of our souls during\r\nthis brief period of our being, while in these bodies. In God's\r\nappointed time, we shall be transferred to a higher level of vision.\r\nThen, but not before, we may hope for re-union with disembodied\r\nspirits, for intercourse with angels, and for a nearer and more open\r\ncommunion with all divine beings.\r\n\r\nThe principal difference in the methods by which communications were\r\nbelieved to be made between mortals and spiritual beings, at the time\r\nof the witchcraft delusion and now, is this. Then it was chiefly by the\r\nmedium of the eye, but at present by the ear. The \"afflicted children\"\r\nprofessed to have seen and conversed with the ghosts of George\r\nBurroughs's former wives and of others. They also professed to have\r\nseen the shapes or appearances of living persons in a disembodied form,\r\nor in the likeness of some animal or creature. Now it is affirmed by\r\nthose calling themselves Spiritualists, that, by certain rappings or\r\nother incantations, they can summon into immediate but invisible\r\npresence the spirits of the departed, hold conferences with them, and\r\ndraw from them information not derivable from any sources of human\r\nknowledge. There is no essential distinction between the old and the\r\nnew belief and practice. The consequences that resulted from the former\r\nwould be[ii.429] likely to result from the latter, if it should obtain\r\nuniversal or general credence, be allowed to mix with judicial\r\nproceedings, or to any extent affect the rights of person, property, or\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe \"afflicted children\" at Salem Village had, by long practice, become\r\nwonderful adepts in the art of jugglery, and probably of ventriloquism.\r\nThey did many extraordinary things, and were believed to have constant\r\ncommunications with ghosts and spectres; but they did not attain to\r\nspiritual rapping. If they had possessed that power, the credulity of\r\njudges, ministers, magistrates, and people, would have been utterly\r\noverwhelmed, and no limit could have been put to the destruction they\r\nmight have wrought.\r\n\r\nIf there was any thing supernatural in the witchcraft of 1692, if any\r\nother than human spirits were concerned at all, one thing is beyond a\r\ndoubt: they were shockingly wicked spirits, and led those who dealt\r\nwith them to the utmost delusion, crime, and perdition; and this\r\nexample teaches all who seek to consult with spirits, through a medium\r\nor in any other way, to be very strict to require beforehand the most\r\nsatisfactory and conclusive evidence of good character before they put\r\nthemselves into communication with them. Spirits who are said to\r\nconverse with people, in these modern ages, cannot be considered as\r\nhaving much claim to a good repute. No valuable discovery of truth, no\r\nimportant guidance in human conduct, no useful instruction, has ever\r\nbeen conveyed to mankind through them; and much[ii.430] mischief\r\nperhaps may have resulted from confiding in them. It is not wise to\r\nplace our minds under the influence of any of our fellow-creatures, in\r\nthe ordinary guise of humanity, unless we know something about them\r\nentitling them to our acquaintance; much less so, to take them into our\r\nintimacy or confidence. Spirits cannot be put under oath, or their\r\ncredibility be subjected to tests. Whether they are spirits of truth or\r\nfalsehood cannot be known; and common caution would seem to dictate an\r\navoidance of their company. The fields of knowledge opened to us in the\r\nworks of mortal men; the stores of human learning and science; the\r\npages of history, sacred or profane; the records of revelation; and the\r\ninstructions and conversation of the wise and good of our\r\nfellow-creatures, while in the body,—are wide enough for our\r\nexploration, and may well occupy the longest lifetime.\r\n\r\nIn its general outlines and minuter details, Salem Witchcraft is an\r\nillustration of the fatal effects of allowing the imagination inflamed\r\nby passion to take the place of common sense, and of pushing the\r\ncuriosity and credence of the human mind, in this stage of our being,\r\nwhile in these corporeal embodiments, beyond the boundaries that ought\r\nto limit their exercise. If we disregard those boundaries, and try to\r\noverleap them, we shall be liable to the same results. The lesson needs\r\nto be impressed equally upon all generations and ages of the world's\r\nfuture history. Essays have been written and books published to prove\r\nthat the sense of the miraculous is destined[ii.431] to decline as\r\nmankind becomes more enlightened, and ascribing a greater or less\r\ntendency to the indulgence of this sense to particular periods of the\r\nchurch, or systems of belief, or schools of what is called philosophy.\r\nIt is maintained that it was more prevalent in the mediæval ages than\r\nin modern times. Some assert that it has had a greater development in\r\nCatholic than Protestant countries; and some, perhaps, insist upon the\r\nreverse. Some attempt to show that it has manifested itself more\r\nremarkably among Puritans than in other classes of Protestant\r\nChristians. The last and most pretentious form of this dogma is, that\r\nthe sense of the miraculous fades away in the progress of what\r\narrogates to itself the name of Rationalism. This is one of the\r\ndelusive results of introducing generalization into historical\r\ndisquisitions. History deals with man. Man is always the same. The race\r\nconsists, not of an aggregation, but of individuals, in all ages, never\r\nmoulded or melted into classes. Each individual has ever retained his\r\ndistinctness from every other. There has been the same infinite variety\r\nin every period, in every race, in every nation. Society, philosophy,\r\ncustom, can no more obliterate these varieties than they can bring the\r\ncountenances and features of men into uniformity. Diversity everywhere\r\nalike prevails. The particular forms and shapes in which the sense of\r\nthe miraculous may express itself have passed and will pass away in the\r\nprogress of civilization. But the sense itself remains; just as\r\nparticular costumes and fashions of garment pass away, while\r\nthe[ii.432] human form, its front erect and its vision towards the\r\nheavens, remains. The sense of the miraculous remains with Protestants\r\nas much as with Catholics, with Churchmen as much as with Puritans,\r\nwith those who reject all creeds, equally with those whose creeds are\r\nthe longest and the oldest. In our day, it must have been generally\r\nnoticed, that the wonders of what imagines itself to be Spiritualism\r\nare rather more accredited by persons who aspire to the character of\r\nrationalists than by those who hold on tenaciously to the old landmarks\r\nof Orthodoxy.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that the sense of the miraculous has not declined, and\r\nnever can. It will grow deeper and stronger with the progress of true\r\nintelligence. As long as man thinks, he will feel that he is himself a\r\nperpetual miracle. The more he thinks, the more will he feel it. The\r\nmind which can wander into the deepest depths of the starry heavens,\r\nand feel itself to be there; which, pondering over the printed page,\r\nlives in the most distant past, communes with sages of hoar antiquity,\r\nwith prophets and apostles, joins the disciples as they walk with the\r\nrisen Lord to Emmaus, or mingles in the throng that listen to Paul at\r\nMars' Hill,—knows itself to be beyond the power of space or time, and\r\ngreater than material things. It knows not what it shall be; but it\r\nfeels that it is something above the present and visible. It realizes\r\nthe spiritual world, and will do so more and more, the higher its\r\nculture, the greater its freedom, and the wider its view of the\r\nmaterial nature[ii.433] by which it is environed, while in this\r\ntransitory stage of its history.\r\n\r\nThe lesson of our story will be found not to discard spiritual things,\r\nbut to teach us, while in the flesh, not to attempt to break through\r\npresent limitations, not to seek to know more than has been made known\r\nof the unseen and invisible, but to keep the inquiries of our minds and\r\nthe action of society within the bounds of knowledge now attainable,\r\nand extend our curious researches and speculations only as far as we\r\ncan here have solid ground to stand upon.\r\n\r\nTo explain the superstitious opinions that took effect in the\r\nwitchcraft delusion, it is necessary to consider the state of biblical\r\ncriticism at that period. That department of theological learning was\r\nthen in a very immature condition.\r\n\r\nThe authority of Scripture, as it appeared on the face of the standard\r\nversion, seemed to require them to pursue the course they adopted; and\r\nthose enlarged and just principles of interpretation which we are\r\ntaught by the learned of all denominations at the present day to apply\r\nto the Sacred Writings had not then been brought to the view of the\r\npeople or received by the clergy.\r\n\r\nIt was gravely argued, for instance, that there was nothing improbable\r\nin the idea that witches had the power, in virtue of their compact with\r\nthe Devil, of riding aloft through the air, because it is recorded, in\r\nthe history of our Lord's temptation, that Satan transported him in a\r\nsimilar manner to the pinnacle of the[ii.434] temple, and to the summit\r\nof an exceedingly high mountain. And Cotton Mather declares, that, to\r\nhis apprehension, the disclosures of the wonderful operations of the\r\nDevil, upon and through his subjects, that were made in the course of\r\nthe witchcraft prosecutions, had shed a marvellous light upon the\r\nScriptures! What a perversion of the Sacred Writings to employ them for\r\nthe purpose of sanctioning the extravagant and delirious reveries of\r\nthe human imagination! What a miserable delusion, to suppose that the\r\nWord of God could receive illumination from the most absurd and\r\nhorrible superstition that ever brooded in darkness over the mind of\r\nman!\r\n\r\nOne of the sources of the delusion of 1692 was ignorance of many\r\nnatural laws that have been revealed by modern science. A vast amount\r\nof knowledge on these subjects has been attained since that time. In\r\nour halls of education, in associations for the diffusion of knowledge,\r\nand in a diversified and all-pervading popular literature, what was\r\ndark and impenetrable mystery then has been explained, accounted for,\r\nand brought within the grasp of all minds. The contemplation of the\r\nevils brought upon our predecessors by their ignorance of the laws of\r\nnature cannot but lead us to appreciate more highly our opportunities\r\nto get knowledge in this department. As we advance into the interior of\r\nthe physical system to which we belong; are led in succession from one\r\nrevelation of beauty and grandeur to another, and the field of light\r\nand truth displaces that of darkness and[ii.435] mystery; while the\r\nfearful images that disturbed the faith and bewildered the thoughts of\r\nour fathers are dissolving and vanishing, the whole host of spirits,\r\nghosts, and demons disappearing, and the presence and providence of God\r\nalone found to fill all scenes and cause all effects,—our hearts ought\r\nto rise to him in loftier adoration and holier devotion. If, while we\r\nenjoy a fuller revelation of his infinite and all-glorious operations\r\nand designs than our fathers did, the sentiment of piety which glowed\r\nin their hearts like a coal from the altar of God has been permitted to\r\ngrow dim in ours, no reproach their errors and faults can possibly\r\nauthorize will equal that which will justly fall upon us.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of their delusion was too great a dependence upon the\r\nimagination. We shall find no lesson more clearly taught by history, by\r\nexperience, or by observation, than this, that man is never safe while\r\neither his fancy or his feeling is the guiding principle of his nature.\r\nThere is a strong and constant attraction between his imagination and\r\nhis passions; and, if either is permitted to exercise unlimited sway,\r\nthe other will most certainly be drawn into co-operation with it, and,\r\nwhen they are allowed to act without restraint upon each other and with\r\neach other, they lead to the derangement and convulsion of his whole\r\nsystem. They constitute the combustible elements of our being: one\r\nserves as the spark to explode the other. Reason, enlightened by\r\nrevelation and guided by conscience, is the great conservative\r\nprin[ii.436]ciple: while that exercises the sovereign power over the\r\nfancy and the passions, we are safe; if it is dethroned, no limit can\r\nbe assigned to the ruin that may follow. In the scenes we have now been\r\ncalled to witness, we have perceived to what lengths of folly, cruelty,\r\nand crime even good men have been carried, who relinquished the aid,\r\nrejected the counsels, and abandoned the guidance of their reason.\r\n\r\nAnother influence that operated to produce the catastrophe in 1692 was\r\nthe power of contagious sympathy. Every wise man and good citizen ought\r\nto be aware of the existence and operation of this power. There seems\r\nindeed to be a constitutional, original, sympathy in our nature. When\r\nmen act in a crowd, their heartstrings are prone to vibrate in unison.\r\nWhatever chord of passion is struck in one breast, the same will ring\r\nforth its wild note through the whole mass. This principle shows itself\r\nparticularly in seasons of excitement, and its power rises in\r\nproportion to the ardor and zeal of those upon whom it acts. It is for\r\nevery one who desires to be preserved from the excesses of popular\r\nfeeling, and to prevent the community to which he belongs from plunging\r\ninto riotous and blind commotions, to keep his own judgment and\r\nemotions as free as possible from a power that seizes all it can reach,\r\ndraws them into its current, and sweeps them round and round like the\r\nMaelstrom, until they are overwhelmed and buried in its devouring\r\nvortex. When others are heated, the only wisdom is to determine to keep\r\ncool; whenever a people or an individual[ii.437] is rushing headlong,\r\nit is the duty of patriotism and of friendship to check the motion.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be remarked—and I should be sorry to bring\r\nthe subject to a close without urging the thought upon your\r\nattention—that the mere power of sympathy, the momentum with which men\r\nact in a crowd, is itself capable of convulsing society and\r\noverthrowing all its safeguards, without the aid or supposed agency of\r\nsupernatural beings. The early history of the colony of New York\r\npresents a case in point.\r\n\r\nIn 1741, just half a century after the witchcraft prosecutions in\r\nMassachusetts, the city of New York, then containing about nine\r\nthousand inhabitants, witnessed a scene quite rivalling, in horror and\r\nfolly, that presented here. Some one started the idea, that a\r\nconspiracy was on foot, among the colored portion of the inhabitants,\r\nto murder the whites. The story was passed from one to another.\r\nAlthough subsequently ascertained to have been utterly without\r\nfoundation, no one stopped to inquire into its truth, or had the wisdom\r\nor courage to discountenance its circulation. Soon a universal panic,\r\nlike a conflagration, spread through the whole community; and the\r\nresults were most frightful. More than one hundred persons were cast\r\ninto prison. Four white persons and eighteen negroes were hanged.\r\nEleven negroes were burned at the stake, and fifty were transported\r\ninto slavery. As in the witchcraft prosecutions, a clergyman was among\r\nthe victims, and perished on the gallows.[ii.438]\r\n\r\nThe \"New-York Negro Plot,\" as it was called, was indeed marked by all\r\nthe features of absurdity in the delusion, ferocity in the popular\r\nexcitement, and destruction along the path of its progress, which\r\nbelonged to the witchcraft proceedings here, and shows that any people,\r\ngiven over to the power of contagious passion, may be swept by\r\ndesolation, and plunged into ruin.\r\n\r\nOne of the practical lessons inculcated by the history that has now\r\nbeen related is, that no duty is more certain, none more important,\r\nthan a free and fearless expression of opinion, by all persons, on all\r\noccasions. No wise or philosophic person would think of complaining of\r\nthe diversities of sentiment it is likely to develop. Such diversities\r\nare the vital principle of free communities, and the only elements of\r\npopular intelligence. If the right to utter them is asserted by all and\r\nfor all, tolerance is secured, and no inconvenience results. It is\r\nprobable that there were many persons here in 1692 who doubted the\r\npropriety of the proceedings at their commencement, but who were\r\nafterwards prevailed upon to fall into the current and swell the tide.\r\nIf they had all discharged their duty to their country and their\r\nconsciences by freely and boldly uttering their disapprobation and\r\ndeclaring their dissent, who can tell but that the whole tragedy might\r\nhave been prevented? and, if it might, the blood of the innocent may be\r\nsaid, in one sense, to be upon their heads.\r\n\r\nThe leading features and most striking aspects of[ii.439] the\r\nwitchcraft delusion have been repeated in places where witches and the\r\ninterference of supernatural beings are never thought of: whenever a\r\ncommunity gives way to its passions, and spurns the admonitions and\r\ncasts off the restraints of reason, there is a delusion that can hardly\r\nbe described in any other phrase. We cannot glance our eye over the\r\nface of our country without beholding such scenes: and, so long as they\r\nare exhibited; so long as we permit ourselves to invest objects of\r\nlittle or no real importance with such an inordinate imaginary interest\r\nthat we are ready to go to every extremity rather than relinquish them;\r\nso long as we yield to the impulse of passion, and plunge into\r\nexcitement, and take counsel of our feelings rather than our\r\njudgment,—we are following in the footsteps of our fanatical ancestors.\r\nIt would be wiser to direct our ridicule and reproaches to the\r\ndelusions of our own times than to those of a previous age; and it\r\nbecomes us to treat with charity and mercy the failings of our\r\npredecessors, at least until we have ceased to imitate and repeat them.\r\n\r\nIt has been my object to collect and arrange all the materials within\r\nreach necessary to give a correct and adequate view of the passage of\r\nhistory related and discussed in this work, and to suggest the\r\nconsiderations and conclusions required by truth and justice. It is\r\nworthy of the most thoughtful contemplation. The moralist,\r\nmetaphysician, and political philosopher will find few chapters of\r\nhuman experience more fraught with instruction, and may well ponder\r\nupon[ii.440] the lessons it teaches, scrutinize thoroughly all its\r\nperiods, phases, and branches, analyze its causes, eliminate its\r\nelements, and mark its developments. The laws, energies, capabilities,\r\nand liabilities of our nature, as exhibited in the character of\r\nindividuals and in the action of society, are remarkably illustrated.\r\nThe essential facts belonging to the transaction, gathered from\r\nauthentic records and reliable testimonies and traditions, have been\r\nfaithfully presented. The Witchcraft Delusion of 1692, so far as I have\r\nbeen able to recover it from misunderstanding and oblivion, has been\r\nbrought to view; and I indulge the belief, that the subject will\r\ncommend itself to, and reward, the study of every meditative mind.\r\n\r\nI know not in what better terms the discussion of this subject can be\r\nbrought to a termination, than in those which express the conclusions\r\nto which one of our own most distinguished citizens was brought, after\r\nhaving examined the whole transaction with the eye of a lawyer and the\r\nspirit of a judge. The following is from the Centennial Discourse\r\npronounced in Salem on the 18th of September, 1828, by the late Hon.\r\nJoseph Story, of the Supreme Court of the United States:—\r\n\r\n\"We may lament, then,\" says he, \"the errors of the times, which led to\r\nthese prosecutions. But surely our ancestors had no special reasons for\r\nshame in a belief which had the universal sanction of their own and all\r\nformer ages; which counted in its train philosophers, as well as\r\nenthusiasts; which was graced[ii.441] by the learning of prelates, as\r\nwell as by the countenance of kings; which the law supported by its\r\nmandates, and the purest judges felt no compunctions in enforcing. Let\r\nWitch Hill remain for ever memorable by this sad catastrophe, not to\r\nperpetuate our dishonor, but as an affecting, enduring proof of human\r\ninfirmity; a proof that perfect justice belongs to one judgment-seat\r\nonly,—that which is linked to the throne of God.\"\r\n\r\nIn the work which has now reached its close, many strange phases of\r\nhumanity have been exposed. We have beheld, with astonishment and\r\nhorror, the extent to which it is liable to be the agent and victim of\r\ndelusion and ruin. Folly that cannot be exceeded; wrong, outrage, and\r\nwoe, melting the heart that contemplates them; and crime, not within\r\nour power or province to measure,—have passed before us. But not the\r\ndark side only of our nature has been displayed. Manifestations of\r\ninnocence, heroism, invincible devotion to truth, integrity of soul\r\ntriumphing over all the terrors and horrors that can be accumulated in\r\nlife and in death, Christian piety in its most heavenly radiance, have\r\nmingled in the drama, whose curtain is now to fall. Noble specimens of\r\nvirtue in man and woman, old and young, have shed a light, as from\r\nabove, upon its dark and melancholy scenes. Not only the sufferers, but\r\nsome of those who shared the dread responsibility of the crisis, demand\r\nour commiseration, and did what they could to atone for their error.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of Judge Sewall claims our particu[ii.442]lar admiration.\r\nHe observed annually in private a day of humiliation and prayer, during\r\nthe remainder of his life, to keep fresh in his mind a sense of\r\nrepentance and sorrow for the part he bore in the trials. On the day of\r\nthe general fast, he rose in the place where he was accustomed to\r\nworship, the Old South, in Boston, and, in the presence of the great\r\nassembly, handed up to the pulpit a written confession, acknowledging\r\nthe error into which he had been led, praying for the forgiveness of\r\nGod and his people, and concluding with a request to all the\r\ncongregation to unite with him in devout supplication, that it might\r\nnot bring down the displeasure of the Most High upon his country, his\r\nfamily, or himself. He remained standing during the public reading of\r\nthe paper. This was an act of true manliness and dignity of soul.\r\n\r\nThe following passage is found in his diary, under the date of April\r\n23, 1720, nearly thirty years afterwards. It was suggested by the\r\nperusal of Neal's \"History of New England:\"—\r\n\r\n\"In Dr. Neal's 'History of New England,' its nakedness is laid open in\r\nthe businesses of the Quakers, Anabaptists, witchcraft. The judges'\r\nnames are mentioned p. 502; my confession, p. 536, vol. ii. The good\r\nand gracious God be pleased to save New England and me, and my family!\"\r\n\r\nThere never was a more striking and complete fulfilment of the\r\napostolic assurance, that the prayer of a righteous man availeth much,\r\nthan in this instance. God has been pleased, in a remarkable manner,\r\nto[ii.443] save and bless New England. The favor of Heaven was bestowed\r\nupon Judge Sewall during the remainder of his life. He presided for\r\nmany years on the bench where he committed the error so sincerely\r\ndeplored by him, and was regarded by all as a benefactor, an ornament,\r\nand a blessing to the community: while his family have enjoyed to a\r\nhigh degree the protection of Providence from that day to this; have\r\nadorned every profession, and every department of society; have filled\r\nwith honor the most elevated stations; have graced, in successive\r\ngenerations, the same lofty seat their ancestor occupied; and been the\r\nobjects of the confidence, respect, and love of their fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nYour thoughts have been led through scenes of the most distressing and\r\nrevolting character. I leave before your imaginations one bright with\r\nall the beauty of Christian virtue,—that which exhibits Judge Sewall\r\nstanding forth in the house of his God and in the presence of his\r\nfellow-worshippers, making a public declaration of his sorrow and\r\nregret for the mistaken judgment he had co-operated with others in\r\npronouncing. Here you have a representation of a truly great and\r\nmagnanimous spirit; a spirit to which the divine influence of our\r\nreligion had given an expansion and a lustre that Roman or Grecian\r\nvirtue never knew; a spirit that had achieved a greater victory than\r\nwarrior ever won,—a victory over itself; a spirit so noble and so pure,\r\nthat it felt no shame in acknowledging an error, and publicly\r\nimploring,[ii.444] for a great wrong done to his fellow-creatures, the\r\nforgiveness of God and man.\r\n\r\nOur Essex poet, whose beautiful genius has made classical the banks of\r\nhis own Merrimac, shed a romantic light over the early homes and\r\ncharacters of New England, and brought back to life the spirit, forms,\r\nscenes, and men of the past, has not failed to immortalize, in his\r\nverse, the profound penitence of the misguided but upright judge:—\r\n\r\n\"Touching and sad, a tale is told,\r\nLike a penitent hymn of the Psalmist old,\r\nOf the fast which the good man life-long kept\r\nWith a haunting sorrow that never slept,\r\nAs the circling year brought round the time\r\nOf an error that left the sting of crime,\r\nWhen he sat on the bench of the witchcraft courts,\r\nWith the laws of Moses and 'Hale's Reports,'\r\nAnd spake, in the name of both, the word\r\nThat gave the witch's neck to the cord,\r\nAnd piled the oaken planks that pressed\r\nThe feeble life from the warlock's breast!\r\nAll the day long, from dawn to dawn,\r\nHis door was bolted, his curtain drawn;\r\nNo foot on his silent threshold trod,\r\nNo eye looked on him save that of God,\r\nAs he baffled the ghosts of the dead with charms\r\nOf penitent tears, and prayers, and psalms,\r\nAnd, with precious proofs from the sacred Word\r\nOf the boundless pity and love of the Lord,\r\nHis faith confirmed and his trust renewed,\r\nThat the sin of his ignorance, sorely rued,\r\nMight be washed away in the mingled flood\r\nOf his human sorrow and Christ's dear blood!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[ii.445]\r\n\r\ndecoration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\ndecoration\r\n\r\n\r\n[ii.447]\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The subject of Salem Witchcraft has been traced to its conclusion, and\r\ndiscussed within its proper limits, in the foregoing work. But whoever\r\nis interested in it as a chapter of history or an exhibition of\r\nhumanity may feel a curiosity, on some points, that reasonably demands\r\ngratification. The questions will naturally arise, Who were the\r\nearliest to extricate themselves and the public from the delusion? what\r\nis known, beyond the facts mentioned in the progress of the foregoing\r\ndiscussion, of the later fortunes of its prominent actors? what the\r\nview taken in the retrospect by individuals and public bodies\r\nimplicated in the transaction? and what opinions on the general subject\r\nhave subsequently prevailed? To answer these questions is the design of\r\nthis Supplement.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n IT can hardly be said that there was any open and avowed opposition in\r\n the community to the proceedings during their early progress. There is\r\n some uncertainty and obscurity to what extent there was an unexpressed\r\n dissent in the minds of particular private persons. On the general\r\n subject of the existence and power of the Devil and his agency, more\r\n or less, in influencing human and earthly affairs, it would be\r\n difficult to prove that there was any considerable difference of\r\n opinion.\r\n\r\nThe first undisguised and unequivocal opposition to the proceedings was\r\na remarkable document that has recently come to light. Among some\r\npapers which have found their way to the custody of the Essex\r\nInstitute, is a letter, dated \"Salisbury, Aug. 9, 1692,\" addressed \"To\r\nthe worshipful Jonathan Corwin, Esq., these present at his house in\r\nSalem.\" It is indorsed, \"A letter[ii.448] to my grandfather, on account\r\nof the condemnation of the witches.\" Its date shows that it was written\r\nwhile the public infatuation and fury were at their height, and the\r\nCourt was sentencing to death and sending to the gallows its successive\r\ncartloads. There is no injunction of secresy, and no shrinking from\r\nresponsibility. Although the name of the writer is not given in full,\r\nhe was evidently well known to Corwin, and had written to him before on\r\nthe subject. The messenger, in accordance with the superscription,\r\nundoubtedly delivered it into the hands of the judge at his residence\r\non the corner of Essex and North Streets. The fact that Jonathan Corwin\r\npreserved this document, and placed it in the permanent files of his\r\nfamily papers, is pretty good proof that he appreciated the weight of\r\nits arguments. It is not improbable that he expressed himself to that\r\neffect to his brethren on the bench, and perhaps to others. What he\r\nsaid, and the fact that he was holding such a correspondence, may have\r\nreached the ears of the accusers, and led them to commence a movement\r\nagainst him by crying out upon his mother-in-law.\r\n\r\nThe letter is a most able argument against the manner in which the\r\ntrials were conducted, and, by conclusive logic, overthrows the whole\r\nfabric of the evidence on the strength of which the Court was\r\nconvicting and taking the lives of innocent persons. No such piece of\r\nreasoning has come to us from that age. Its author must be acknowledged\r\nto have been an expert in dialectic subtleties, and a pure reasoner of\r\nunsurpassed acumen and force. It requires, but it will reward, the\r\nclosest attention and concentration of thought in following the threads\r\nof the argument. It reaches its conclusions on a most difficult subject\r\nwith clearness and certainty. It achieves and realizes, in mere mental\r\nprocesses, quantities, and forces, on the points at which it aims, what\r\nis called demonstration in mathematics and geometry.\r\n\r\nThe writer does not discredit, but seems to have received, the then\r\nprevalent doctrines relating to the personality, power, and attributes\r\nof the Devil; and, from that standpoint, controverts and demolishes the\r\nprinciples on which the Court was proceeding, in reference to the\r\n\"spectral evidence\" and the credibility of the \"afflicted children\"\r\ngenerally. The letter, and the formal argument appended to it, arrest\r\nnotice in one or two general aspects. There is an appearance of their\r\nhaving proceeded from an elderly[ii.449] person, not at all from any\r\nmarks of infirmity of intellect, but rather from an air of wisdom and a\r\ntone of authority which can only result from long experience and\r\nobservation. The circumstance that an amanuensis was employed, and the\r\nauthor writes the initials of his signature only, strengthens this\r\nimpression. At the same time, there are indications of a free and\r\nprogressive spirit, more likely to have had force at an earlier period\r\nof life. In some aspects, the document indicates a theological\r\neducation, and familiarity with matters that belong to the studies of a\r\nminister; in others, it manifests habits of mind and modes of\r\nexpression and reasoning more natural to one accustomed to close legal\r\nstatements and deductions. If the production of a trained professional\r\nman of either class, it would justly be regarded as remarkable. If its\r\nauthor belonged to neither class, but was merely a local magistrate,\r\nfarmer, and militia officer, it becomes more than remarkable. There\r\nmust have been a high development among the founders of our villages,\r\nwhen the laity could present examples of such a capacity to grasp the\r\nmost difficult subjects, and conduct such acute and abstruse\r\ndisquisitions. [See Appendix.]\r\n\r\nThe question as to the authorship of this paper may well excite\r\ninterest, involving, as it does, minute critical speculations. The\r\nelements that enter into its solution illustrate the difficulties and\r\nperplexities encompassing the study of local antiquities, and attempts\r\nto determine the origin and bearings of old documents or to settle\r\nminute points of history. The weight of evidence seems to indicate that\r\nthe document is attributable to Major Robert Pike, of Salisbury.\r\nWhoever was its author did his duty nobly, and stands alone, above all\r\nthe scholars and educated men of the time, in bearing testimony openly,\r\nbravely, in the very ears of the Court, against the disgraceful and\r\nshocking course they were pursuing.[I]\r\n[ii.450]\r\nWilliam Brattle, an eminent citizen and opulent merchant of Boston, and\r\na gentleman of education and uncommon abilities, wrote a letter to an\r\nunknown correspondent of the clerical profes[ii.451]sion, in October,\r\n1692. It is an able criticism upon the methods of procedure at the\r\ntrials, condemning them in the strongest language; but it was a\r\nconfidential communication, and not published[ii.452] until many years\r\nafterwards. He says that \"the witches' meetings, the Devil's baptisms\r\nand mock sacraments, which the accusing and confessing witches oft\r\nspeak of, are nothing else but the effect of their fancy, depraved and\r\ndeluded by the Devil, and not a reality to be regarded or minded by any\r\nwise man.\" He charges the judges with having taken testimony from the\r\nDevil himself, through witnesses who swore to what they said the Devil\r\ncommunicated to them, thus indirectly introducing the Devil as a\r\nwitness; and he clinches the accusation by quoting the judges\r\nthemselves, who, when the accusing and confessing witnesses\r\ncontradicted each other, got over the difficulty by saying that the\r\nDevil, in such instances, took away the memory of some of them, for the\r\nmoment, obscuring their brains, and misleading them. He sums up this\r\npart of his reasoning in these words: \"If it be thus granted that the\r\nDevil is able to represent false ideas to the imaginations of the\r\nconfessors, what man of sense will regard the confessions, or any of\r\nthe words of these confessors?\" He says that he knows several persons\r\n\"about the Bay,\"—men, for understanding, judgment, and piety, inferior\r\nto few, if any, in New England,—that do utterly condemn the said\r\nproceedings. He repudiates the idea that Salem was, in any sense,\r\nexclusively responsible for the transaction; and affirms that \"other\r\njustices in the country, besides the Salem jus[ii.453]tices, have\r\nissued out their warrants;\" and states, that, of the eight \"judges,\r\ncommissioned for this Court at Salem, five do belong to Suffolk County,\r\nfour of which five do belong to Boston, and therefore I see no reason\r\nwhy Boston should talk of Salem as though their own judges had had no\r\nhand in these proceedings in Salem.\"\r\n\r\nThere is one view of the subject, upon which Brattle presses with much\r\nforce and severity. There is ground to suspect, that the proceedings\r\nwere suffered to go on, after some of those appearing to countenance\r\nthem had ceased to have faith in the accusations. He charges, directly,\r\ncomplicity in the escape of Mrs. Carey, Mrs. English, Captain Alden,\r\nHezekiah Usher, and others, upon the high officials; and says that\r\nwhile the evidence, upon which so many had been imprisoned, sentenced,\r\nand executed, bore against Mrs. Thacher, of Boston, she was never\r\nproceeded against. \"She was much complained of by the afflicted\r\npersons, and yet the justices would not issue out their warrants to\r\napprehend\" her and certain others; while at the very same time they\r\nwere issuing, upon no better or other grounds, warrants against so many\r\nothers. He charges the judges with this most criminal favoritism. The\r\nfacts hardly justify such an imputation upon the judges. They did not,\r\nafter the trials had begun, it is probable, ever issue warrants: that\r\nwas the function of magistrates. With the exception, perhaps, of\r\nCorwin, I think there is no evidence of there having been any doubts or\r\nmisgivings on the bench. It is altogether too heavy a charge to bring,\r\nwithout the strongest evidence, upon any one. To intimate that\r\nofficials, or any persons, who did not believe in the accusations,\r\nconnived at the escape of their friends and relatives, and at the same\r\ntime countenanced, pretended to believe, and gave deadly effect to them\r\nwhen directed against others, is supposing a criminality and baseness\r\ntoo great to be readily admitted. In that wild reign of the worst of\r\npassions, this would have transcended them all in its iniquity. The\r\nonly excusable people at that time were those who honestly, and without\r\na doubt, believed in the guilt of the convicted. Those who had doubts,\r\nand did not frankly and fearlessly express them, were the guilty ones.\r\nOn their hands is the stain of the innocent blood that was shed. It is\r\nnot probable, and is scarcely possible, that any considerable number\r\ncould be at once doubters and prosecutors. On this[ii.454] point,\r\nBrattle must be understood to mean, not that judges, or others actively\r\nengaged in the prosecutions, warded off proceedings against particular\r\nfriends or relatives from a principle of deliberate favoritism, but\r\nthat third parties, actuated by a sycophantic spirit, endeavored to\r\nhush up or intercept complaints, when directed too near to the high\r\nofficials, or thought to gain their favor by aiding the escape of\r\npersons in whom they were interested.\r\n\r\nBrattle uses the same weapon which afterwards the opponents of Mr.\r\nParris, in his church at Salem Village, wielded with such decisive\r\neffect against him and all who abetted him. It is much to be lamented,\r\nthat, instead of hiding it under a confidential letter, he did not at\r\nthe time openly bring it to bear in the most public and defiant manner.\r\nOne brave, strong voice, uttered in the face of the court and in the\r\ncongregations of the people, echoed from the corners of the streets,\r\nand reaching the ears of the governor and magistrates, denouncing the\r\nentire proceedings as the damnable crime of familiarity with evil\r\nspirits, and sorcery of the blackest dye, might perhaps have recalled\r\nthe judges, the people, and the rulers to their senses. If the spirit\r\nof the ancient prophets of God, of the Quakers of the preceding age, or\r\nof true reformers of any age, had existed in any breast, the experiment\r\nwould have been tried. Brattle says,—\r\n\r\n\"I cannot but admire that any should go with their distempered friends\r\nand relations to the afflicted children, to know what their distempered\r\nfriends ail, whether they are not bewitched, who it is that afflicts\r\nthem, and the like. It is true, I know no reason why these afflicted\r\nmay not be consulted as well as any other, if so be that it was only\r\ntheir natural and ordinary knowledge that was had recourse to: but it\r\nis not on this notion that these afflicted children are sought unto,\r\nbut as they have a supernatural knowledge; a knowledge which they\r\nobtain by their holding correspondence with spectres or evil spirits,\r\nas they themselves grant. This consulting of these afflicted children,\r\nas abovesaid, seems to me to be a very gross evil, a real abomination,\r\nnot fit to be known in New England; and yet is a thing practised, not\r\nonly by _Tom_ and _John_,—I mean the rude and more ignorant sort,—but\r\nby many who profess high, and pass among us for some of the better\r\nsort. This is that which aggravates the evil, and makes it heinous and\r\ntremendous; and yet this is not the worst of it,—for, as[ii.455] sure\r\nas I now write to you, even some of our civil leaders and spiritual\r\nteachers, who, I think, should punish and preach down such sorcery and\r\nwickedness, do yet allow of, encourage, yea, and practise, this very\r\nabomination. I know there are several worthy gentlemen in Salem who\r\naccount this practice as an abomination, have trembled to see the\r\nmethods of this nature which others have used, and have declared\r\nthemselves to think the practice to be very evil and corrupt. But all\r\navails little with the abettors of the said practice.\"\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Brattle and the \"several worthy gentlemen\" to whom he alludes,\r\ninstead of sitting in \"trembling\" silence, or whispering in private\r\ntheir disapprobation, or writing letters under the injunction of\r\nsecrecy, had come boldly out, and denounced the whole thing, in a\r\nspirit of true courage, meeting and defying the risk, and carrying the\r\nwar home, and promptly, upon the ministers, magistrates, and judges,\r\nthey might have succeeded, and exploded the delusion before it had\r\nreached its fatal results.\r\n\r\nHe mentions, in the course of his letter, among those persons known by\r\nhim to disapprove of the proceedings,—\r\n\r\n\"The Hon. Simon Bradstreet, Esq. (our late governor), the Hon. Thomas\r\nDanforth, Esq. (our late deputy-governor), the Rev. Mr. Increase\r\nMather, and the Rev. Mr. Samuel Willard. Major N. Saltonstall, Esq.,\r\nwho was one of the judges, has left the court, and is very much\r\ndissatisfied with the proceedings of it. Excepting Mr. Hale, Mr. Noyes,\r\nand Mr. Parris, the reverend elders, almost throughout the whole\r\ncountry, are very much dissatisfied. Several of the late justices—viz.,\r\nThomas Graves, Esq.; N. Byfield, Esq.; Francis Foxcroft, Esq.—are much\r\ndissatisfied; also several of the present justices, and, in particular,\r\nsome of the Boston justices, were resolved rather to throw up their\r\ncommissions than be active in disturbing the liberty of Their\r\nMajesties' subjects merely on the accusations of these afflicted,\r\npossessed children.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, that the dissatisfaction was with some of the\r\nmethods adopted in the proceedings, and not with the prosecutions\r\nthemselves. Increase Mather and Samuel Willard signed the paper\r\nindorsing Deodat Lawson's famous sermon, which surely drove on the\r\nprosecutions; and the former expressed, in print, his approbation of\r\nhis son Cotton's \"Wonders of the Invisible World,\" in which he labors\r\nto defend the witchcraft prosecutions, and to make it out that those\r\nwho suffered were \"malefactors.\"[ii.456] Dr. Increase Mather is\r\nunderstood to have countenanced the burning of Calef's book, some few\r\nyears afterwards, in the square of the public grounds of Harvard\r\nCollege, of which institution he was then president. It cannot be\r\ndoubted, however, that both the elder Mather and Mr. Willard had\r\nexpressed, more or less distinctly, their disapprobation of some of the\r\ndetails of the proceedings. It is honorable to their memories, and\r\nshows that the former was not wholly blinded by parental weakness, but\r\nwilling to express his dissent, in some particulars, from the course of\r\nhis distinguished son, and that the latter had an independence of\r\ncharacter which enabled him to criticise and censure a court in which\r\nthree of his parishioners sat as judges.\r\n\r\nBrattle relates a story which seems to indicate that Increase Mather\r\nsometimes was unguarded enough to express himself with severity against\r\nthose who gave countenance to the proceedings. \"A person from Boston,\r\nof no small note, carried up his child to Salem, near twenty miles, on\r\npurpose that he might consult the afflicted about his child, which\r\naccordingly he did; and the afflicted told him that his child was\r\nafflicted by Mrs. Carey and Mrs. Obinson.\" The \"afflicted,\" in this and\r\nsome other instances, had struck too high. The magistrates in Boston\r\nwere unwilling to issue a warrant against Mrs. Obinson, and Mrs. Carey\r\nhad fled. All that the man got for his pains, in carrying his child to\r\nSalem, was a hearty scolding from Increase Mather, who asked him\r\n\"whether there was not a God in Boston, that he should go to the Devil,\r\nin Salem, for advice.\"\r\n\r\nBradstreet's great age prevented, it is to be supposed, his public\r\nappearance in the affair; but his course in a case which occurred\r\ntwelve years before fully justifies confidence in the statement of\r\nBrattle. The tradition has always prevailed, that he looked with\r\ndisapprobation upon the proceedings, from beginning to end. The course\r\nof his sons, and the action taken against them, is quite decisive to\r\nthe point.\r\n\r\nFacts have been stated, which show that Thomas Danforth, if he\r\ndisapproved of the proceedings at Salem, in October, must have\r\nundergone a rapid change of sentiments. No irregularities,\r\nimproprieties, extravagances, or absurdities ever occurred in the\r\nexaminations or trials greater than he was fully responsible for in\r\nApril. Having, in the mean while, been superseded in office, he[ii.457]\r\nhad leisure, in his retirement, to think over the whole matter; and it\r\nis satisfactory to find that he saw the error of the ways in which he\r\nhad gone himself, and led others.\r\n\r\nThe result of the inquiry on this point is, that, while some, outside\r\nof the village, began early to doubt the propriety of the proceedings\r\nin certain particulars, they failed, with the single exception of\r\nRobert Pike, to make manly and seasonable resistance. He remonstrated\r\nin a writing signed with his own initials, and while the executions\r\nwere going on. He sent it to one of the judges, and did not shrink from\r\nhaving his action known. No other voice was raised, no one else\r\nbreasted the storm, while it lasted. The errors which led to the\r\ndelusion were not attacked from any quarter at any time during that\r\ngeneration, and have remained lurking in many minds, in a greater or\r\nless degree, to our day.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, three persons in Salem Village and its immediate\r\nvicinity, who deserve to be for ever remembered in this connection.\r\nThey resisted the fanaticism at the beginning, and defied its wrath.\r\nJoseph Putnam was a little more than twenty-two years of age. He\r\nprobably did not enter into the question of the doctrines then\r\nmaintained on such subjects, but was led by his natural sagacity and\r\nindependent spirit to the course he took. In opposition to both his\r\nbrothers and both his uncles, and all the rest of his powerful and\r\nextensive family, he denounced the proceedings through and through. At\r\nthe very moment when the excitement was at its most terrible stage, and\r\nMr. Parris held the life of every one in his hands, Joseph Putnam\r\nexpressed his disapprobation of his conduct by carrying his infant\r\nchild to the church in Salem to be baptized. This was a public and most\r\nsignificant act. For six months, he kept some one of his horses under\r\nsaddle night and day, without a moment's intermission of the\r\nprecaution; and he and his family were constantly armed. It was\r\nunderstood, that, if any one attempted to arrest him, it would be at\r\nthe peril of life. If the marshal should approach with overwhelming\r\nforce, he would spring to his saddle, and bid defiance to pursuit. Such\r\na course as this, taken by one standing alone against the whole\r\ncommunity to which he belonged, shows a degree of courage, spirit, and\r\nresolution, which cannot but be held in honor.[ii.458]\r\n\r\nMartha Corey was an aged Christian professor, of eminently devout\r\nhabits and principles. It is, indeed, a strange fact, that, in her\r\nhumble home, surrounded, as it then was, by a wilderness, this\r\nhusbandman's wife should have reached a height so above and beyond her\r\nage. But it is proved conclusively by the depositions adduced against\r\nher, that her mind was wholly disenthralled from the errors of that\r\nperiod. She utterly repudiated the doctrines of witchcraft, and\r\nexpressed herself freely and fearlessly against them. The prayer which\r\nthis woman made \"upon the ladder,\" and which produced such an\r\nimpression on those who heard it, was undoubtedly expressive of\r\nenlightened piety, worthy of being characterized as \"eminent\" in its\r\nsentiments, and in its demonstration of an innocent heart and life.\r\n\r\nThe following paper, in the handwriting of Mr. Parris, is among the\r\ncourt-files. It has not the ordinary form of a deposition, but somehow\r\nwas sworn to in Court:—\r\n\r\n\"The morning after the examination of Goody Nurse, Sam. Sibley met John\r\nProcter about Mr. Phillips's, who called to said Sibley as he was going\r\nto said Phillips's, and asked how the folks did at the village. He\r\nanswered, he heard they were very bad last night, but he had heard\r\nnothing this morning. Procter replied, he was going to fetch home his\r\njade; he left her there last night, and had rather given forty\r\nshillings than let her come up. Said Sibley asked why he talked so.\r\nProcter replied, if they were let alone so, we should all be devils and\r\nwitches quickly; they should rather be had to the whipping-post; but he\r\nwould fetch his jade home, and thrash the Devil out of her,—and more to\r\nthe like purpose, crying, 'Hang them! hang them!'\"\r\n\r\nIn another document, it is stated that Nathaniel Ingersoll and others\r\nheard John Procter tell Joseph Pope, \"that, if he had John Indian in\r\nhis custody, he would soon beat the Devil out of him.\"\r\n\r\nThe declarations thus ascribed to John Procter show that his views of\r\nthe subject were about right; and it will probably be generally\r\nconceded, that the treatment he proposed for Mary Warren and \"John\r\nIndian,\" if dealt out to the \"afflicted children\" generally at the\r\noutset, would have prevented all the mischief. A sound thrashing all\r\nround, seasonably administered, would have reached the root of the\r\nmatter; and the story which has now been concluded of Salem witchcraft\r\nwould never have been told.\r\n\r\nWhen the witchcraft tornado burst upon Andover, it prostrated[ii.459]\r\nevery thing before it. Accusers and accused were counted by scores, and\r\nunder the panic of the hour the accused generally confessed. But\r\nAndover was the first to recover its senses. On the 12th of October,\r\n1692, seven of its citizens addressed a memorial to the General Court\r\nin behalf of their wives and children, praying that they might be\r\nreleased on bond, \"to remain as prisoners in their own houses, where\r\nthey may be more tenderly cared for.\" They speak of their \"distressed\r\ncondition in prison,—a company of poor distressed creatures as full of\r\ninward grief and trouble as they are able to bear up in life withal.\"\r\nThey refer to the want of \"food convenient\" for them, and to \"the\r\ncoldness of the winter season that is coming which may despatch such\r\nout of the way that have not been used to such hardships,\" and\r\nrepresent the ruinous effects of their absence from their families, who\r\nwere at the same time required to maintain them in jail. On the 18th of\r\nOctober, the two ministers of Andover, Francis Dane and Thomas Barnard,\r\nwith twenty-four other citizens of Andover, addressed a similar\r\nmemorial to the Governor and General Court, in which we find the first\r\npublic expression of condemnation of the proceedings. They call the\r\naccusers \"distempered persons.\" They express the opinion that their\r\nfriends and neighbors have been misrepresented. They bear the strongest\r\ntestimony in favor of the persons accused, that several of them are\r\nmembers of the church in full communion, of blameless conversation, and\r\n\"walking as becometh women professing godliness.\" They relate the\r\nmethods by which they had been deluded and terrified into confession,\r\nand show the worthlessness of those confessions as evidences against\r\nthem. They use this bold and significant language: \"Our troubles we\r\nforesee are likely to continue and increase, if other methods be not\r\ntaken than as yet have been; and we know not who can think himself\r\nsafe, if the accusations of children and others who are under a\r\ndiabolical influence shall be received against persons of good fame.\"\r\nOn the 2d of January, 1693, the Rev. Francis Dane addressed a letter to\r\na brother clergyman, which is among the files, and was probably\r\ndesigned to reach the eyes of the Court, in which he vindicates Andover\r\nagainst the scandalous reports got up by the accusers, and says that a\r\nresidence there of forty-four years, and intimacy with the people,\r\nenable him to declare that they are not justly chargeable with\r\nany[ii.460] such things as witchcraft, charms, or sorceries of any\r\nkind. He expresses himself in strong language: \"Had charity been put\r\non, the Devil would not have had such an advantage against us, and I\r\nbelieve many innocent persons have been accused and imprisoned.\" He\r\ndenounces \"the conceit of spectre evidence,\" and warns against\r\ncontinuing in a course of proceeding that will procure \"the divine\r\ndispleasure.\" A paper signed by Dudley Bradstreet, Francis Dane, Thomas\r\nBarnard, and thirty-eight other men and twelve women of Andover, was\r\npresented to the Court at Salem to the same effect.\r\n\r\nNone of the persons named by Brattle can present so strong a claim to\r\nthe credit of having opposed the witchcraft fanaticism before the close\r\nof the year 1692, as Francis Dane, his colleague Barnard, and the\r\ncitizens of Andover, who signed memorials to the Legislature on the\r\n18th of October, and to the Court of Trials about the same time. There\r\nis, indeed, one conclusive proof that the venerable senior pastor of\r\nthe Andover Church made his disapprobation of the witchcraft\r\nproceedings known at an earlier period, at least in his immediate\r\nneighborhood. The wrath of the accusers was concentrated upon him to an\r\nunparalleled extent from their entrance into Andover. They did not\r\nventure to attack him directly. His venerable age and commanding\r\nposition made it inexpedient; but they struck as near him, and at as\r\nmany points, as they dared. They accused, imprisoned, and caused to be\r\nconvicted and sentenced to death, one of his daughters, Abigail\r\nFaulkner. They accused, imprisoned, and brought to trial another,\r\nElizabeth Johnson. They imprisoned, and brought to the sentence of\r\ndeath, his grand-daughter, Elizabeth Johnson, Jr. They cried out\r\nagainst, and caused to be imprisoned, several others of his\r\ngrandchildren. They accused and imprisoned Deliverance the wife, and\r\nalso the \"man-servant,\" of his son Nathaniel. There is reason for\r\nsupposing, as has been stated, that Elizabeth How was the wife of his\r\nnephew. Surely, no one was more signalized by their malice and\r\nresentment than Francis Dane; and he deserves to be recognized as\r\nstanding pre-eminent, and, for a time, almost alone, in bold\r\ndenunciation and courageous resistance of the execrable proceedings of\r\nthat dark day.\r\n\r\nFrancis Dane made the following statement, also designed to reach the\r\nauthorities, which cannot be read by any person of sen[ii.461]sibility\r\nwithout feeling its force, although it made no impression upon the\r\nCourt at the time:—\r\n\r\n\"Concerning my daughter Elizabeth Johnson, I never had ground to\r\nsuspect her, neither have I heard any other to accuse her, till by\r\nspectre evidence she was brought forth; but this I must say, she was\r\nweak, and incapacious, fearful, and in that respect I fear she hath\r\nfalsely accused herself and others. Not long before she was sent for,\r\nshe spake as to her own particular, that she was sure she was no witch.\r\nAnd for her daughter Elizabeth, she is but simplish at the best; and I\r\nfear the common speech, that was frequently spread among us, of their\r\nliberty if they would confess, and the like expression used by some,\r\nhave brought many into a snare. The Lord direct and guide those that\r\nare in place, and give us all submissive wills; and let the Lord do\r\nwith me and mine what seems good in his own eyes!\"\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the proceedings of the Special Court of Oyer and\r\nTerminer more disgraceful than the fact, that the regular Court of\r\nSuperior Judicature, the next year, after the public mind had been\r\nrescued from the delusion, and the spectral evidence repudiated,\r\nproceeded to try these and other persons, and, in the face of such\r\nstatements as the foregoing, actually condemned to death Elizabeth\r\nJohnson, Jr.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that Brattle does not mention Calef. The understanding\r\nhas been that they acted in concert, and that Brattle had a hand in\r\ngetting up some of Calef's arguments. The silence of Brattle is not,\r\nupon the whole, at all inconsistent with their mutual action and\r\nalliance. As Calef was more perfectly unembarrassed, without personal\r\nrelations to the clergy and others in high station, and not afraid to\r\nstand in the gap, it was thought best to let him take the fire of\r\nCotton Mather. His name had not been connected with the matter in the\r\npublic apprehension. He was a merchant of Boston, and a son of Robert\r\nCalef of Roxbury. His attention was called to the proceedings which\r\noriginated in Salem Village; and his strong faculties and moral courage\r\nenabled him to become the most efficient opponent, in his day, of the\r\nsystem of false reasoning upon which the prosecutions rested. He\r\nprepared several able papers in different forms, in which he discussed\r\nthe subject with great ability, and treated Cotton Mather and all\r\nothers whom he regarded as instrumental in precipitating the community\r\ninto the fatal tragedy,[ii.462] with the greatest severity of language\r\nand force of logic, holding up the whole procedure to merited\r\ncondemnation. They were first printed, at London, in 1700, in a small\r\nquarto volume, under the title of \"More Wonders of the Invisible\r\nWorld.\" This publication burst like a bomb-shell upon all who had been\r\nconcerned in promoting the witchcraft prosecutions. Cotton Mather was\r\nexasperated to the highest pitch. He says in his diary: \"He sent this\r\nvile volume to London to be published, and the book is printed; and the\r\nimpression is, this day week, arrived here. The books that I have sent\r\nover into England, with a design to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ, are\r\nnot published, but strangely delayed; and the books that are sent over\r\nto vilify me, and render me incapable to glorify the Lord Jesus\r\nChrist,—these are published.\" Calef's writings gave a shock to Mather's\r\ninfluence, from which it never recovered.\r\n\r\nGreat difficulty has been experienced in drawing the story out in its\r\ntrue chronological sequence. The effect produced upon the public mind,\r\nwhen it became convinced that the proceedings had been wrong, and\r\ninnocent blood shed, was a universal disposition to bury the\r\nrecollection of the whole transaction in silence, and, if possible,\r\noblivion. This led to a suppression and destruction of the ordinary\r\nmaterials of history. Papers were abstracted from the files, documents\r\nin private hands were committed to the flames, and a chasm left in the\r\nrecords of churches and public bodies. The journal of the Special Court\r\nof Oyer and Terminer is nowhere to be found. Hutchinson appears to have\r\nhad access to it. It cannot well be supposed to have been lost by fire\r\nor other accident, because the records of the regular Court, up to the\r\nvery time when the Special Court came into operation, and from the time\r\nwhen it expired, are preserved in order. A portion of the papers\r\nconnected with the trials have come down in a miscellaneous, scattered,\r\nand dilapidated state, in the offices of the Clerk of the Courts in the\r\nCounty of Essex, and of the Secretary of the Commonwealth. By far the\r\nlarger part have been abstracted, of which a few have been deposited,\r\nby parties into whose hands they had happened to come, with the\r\nMassachusetts Historical Society in Boston and the Essex Institute at\r\nSalem. The records of the parish of Salem Village, although exceedingly\r\nwell kept before and after 1692 by Thomas Putnam, are in another hand\r\nfor that[ii.463] year, very brief, and make no reference whatever to\r\nthe witchcraft transactions. This general desire to obliterate the\r\nmemory of the calamity has nearly extinguished tradition. It is more\r\nscanty and less reliable than on any other event at an equal distance\r\nin the past. A subject on which men avoided to speak soon died out of\r\nknowledge. The localities of many very interesting incidents cannot be\r\nidentified. This is very observable, and peculiarly remarkable as to\r\nplaces in the now City of Salem. The reminiscences floating about are\r\nvague, contradictory, and few in number. In a community of uncommon\r\nintelligence, composed, to a greater degree perhaps than almost any\r\nother, of families that have been here from the first, very inquisitive\r\nfor knowledge, and always imbued with the historical spirit, it is\r\ntruly surprising how little has been borne down, by speech and memory,\r\nin the form of anecdote, personal traits, or local incidents, of this\r\nmost extraordinary and wonderful occurrence of such world-wide\r\ncelebrity. Almost all that we know is gleaned from the offices of the\r\nRegistry of Deeds and Wills.[J]\r\n[ii.464]\r\nIt is remarkable, that the marshal and sheriff, both quite young men,\r\nso soon followed their victims to the other world. Jonathan Walcot, the\r\nfather of Mary, and next neighbor to Parris, removed from the village,\r\nand died at Salem in 1699. Thomas Putnam and Ann his wife, the parents\r\nof the \"afflicted child,\" who acted so extraordinary a part in the\r\nproceedings and of whom further mention will be made, died in 1699,—the\r\nformer on the 24th of May, the latter on the 8th of June,—at the\r\nrespective ages of forty-seven and thirty-eight.[K] There are\r\nindications that they saw the errors into which they had been led. If\r\ntheir eyes were at all opened to this view, how terrible must have been\r\nthe thought of the cruel wrongs and wide-spread ruin of which they had\r\nbeen the cause! Of the circumstances of their deaths, or their last\r\nwords and sentiments, we have no knowledge. It is not strange, that, in\r\naddition to all her woes, the death of her husband was more than Mrs.\r\nAnn Putnam could bear, and that[ii.465] she followed him so soon to the\r\ngrave. Of the other accusers, we have but little information. Elizabeth\r\nBooth was married to Israel Shaw about the year 1700. Mary Walcot was\r\nmarried, somewhere between 1692 and 1697, to a person belonging to\r\nWoburn, whose name is torn or worn off from Mr. Parris's records. Of\r\nthe other \"afflicted children\" nothing is known, beyond the fact, that\r\nthe Act of the Legislature of the Province, reversing the judgments,\r\nand taking off the attainder from those who were sentenced to death in\r\n1692, has this paragraph: \"Some of the principal accusers and witnesses\r\nin those dark and severe prosecutions have since discovered themselves\r\nto be persons of profligate and vicious conversation;\" and Calef speaks\r\nof them as \"vile varlets,\" and asserts that their reputations were not\r\nwithout spot before, and that subsequently they became abandoned to\r\nopen and shameless vice.\r\n\r\nA very considerable number of the people left the place. John Shepard\r\nand Samuel Sibley sold their lands, and went elsewhere; as did Peter\r\nCloyse, who never brought his family to the village after his wife's\r\nrelease from prison. Edward and Sarah Bishop sold their estates, and\r\ntook up their abode at Rehoboth. Some of the Raymond family removed to\r\nMiddleborough. The Haynes family emigrated to New Jersey. No mention is\r\nafterwards found of other families in the record-books. The descendants\r\nof Thomas and Edward Putnam, in the next generation, were mostly\r\ndis[ii.466]persed to other places; but those of Joseph remained on his\r\nlands, and have occupied his homestead to this day. It is a singular\r\ncircumstance, that some of the spots where, particularly, the great\r\nmischief was brewed, are, and long have been, deserted. Where the\r\nparsonage stood, with its barn and garden and well and pathways, is now\r\na bare and rugged field, without a vestige of its former occupancy,\r\nexcept a few broken bricks that mark the site of the house. The same is\r\nthe case of the homestead of Jonathan Walcot. It was in these two\r\nfamilies that the affair began and was matured. The spots where several\r\nothers, who figured in the proceedings, lived, have ceased to be\r\noccupied; and the only signs of former habitation are hollows in the\r\nground, fragments of pottery, and heaps of stones denoting the location\r\nof cellars and walls. Here and there, where houses and other structures\r\nonce stood, the blight still rests.\r\n\r\nSome circumstances relating to the personal history of those who\r\nexperienced the greatest misery during the prevalence of the dreadful\r\nfanaticism, and were left to mourn over its victims, have happened to\r\nbe preserved in records and documents on file. On the 30th of November,\r\n1699, Margaret Jacobs was married to John Foster. She belonged to Mr.\r\nNoyes's parish; but the recollection of his agency in pushing on\r\nproceedings which carried in their train the execution of her aged\r\ngrandfather, the exile of her father, the long imprisonment of her\r\nmother and herself, with the prospect of a violent and shameful death\r\nhanging over them every hour, and, above all, her own wretched\r\nabandonment of truth and conscience for a while, probably under his\r\npersuasion, made it impossible for her to think of being married by\r\nhim. Mr. Greene was known to sympathize with those who had suffered,\r\nand the couple went to the village to be united. Some years afterwards,\r\nwhen the church of the Middle Precinct, now South Danvers, was\r\norganized, John and Margaret Foster, among the first, took their\r\nchildren there for baptism; and their descendants are numerous, in this\r\nneighborhood and elsewhere. Margaret, the widow of John Willard,\r\nmarried William Towne. Elizabeth, the widow of John Procter, married,\r\nsubsequently to 1696, a person named Richards. Edward Bishop, the\r\nhusband of Bridget, a few years afterwards was appointed guardian of\r\nSusannah Mason, the only child of Christian, who was the only child of\r\nBridget by her[ii.467] former husband Thomas Oliver. Bishop seems to\r\nhave invested the money of his ward in the lot at the extreme end of\r\nForrester Street, where it connects with Essex Street, bounded by\r\nForrester Street on the north and east, and Essex Street on the south.\r\nThis was the property of Susannah when she married John Becket, Jr.\r\nBishop appears to have continued his business of a sawyer to a very\r\nadvanced age, and died in Salem, in 1705.\r\n\r\nSarah Nurse, about two years after her mother's death, married Michael\r\nBowden, of Marblehead; and they occupied her father's house, in the\r\ntown of Salem, of which he had retained the possession. His family\r\nhaving thus all been married off, Francis Nurse gave up his homestead\r\nto his son Samuel, and divided his remaining property among his four\r\nsons and four daughters. He made no formal deed or will, but drew up a\r\npaper, dated Dec. 4, 1694, describing the distribution of the estate,\r\nand what he expected of his children. He gave them immediate occupancy\r\nand possession of their respective portions. The provision made by the\r\nold man for his comfort, and the conditions required of his children,\r\nare curious. They give an interesting insight of the life of a rural\r\npatriarch. He reserved his \"great chair and cushion;\" a great chest;\r\nhis bed and bedding; wardrobe, linen and woollen; a pewter pot; one\r\nmare, bridle, saddle, and sufficient fodder; the whole of the crop of\r\ncorn, both Indian and English, he had made that year. The children were\r\nto discharge all the debts of his estate, pay him fourteen pounds a\r\nyear, and contribute equally, as much more as might be necessary for\r\nhis comfortable maintenance, and also to his \"decent burial.\" The\r\nlabors of his life had closed. He had borne the heaviest burden that\r\ncan be laid on the heart of a good man. He found rest, and sought\r\nsolace and support, in the society and love of his children and their\r\nfamilies, as he rode from house to house on the road he had opened, by\r\nwhich they all communicated with each other. The parish records show\r\nthat he continued his interest in its affairs. He lived just long\r\nenough to behold sure evidence that justice would be done to the memory\r\nof those who suffered, and the authors of the mischief be consigned to\r\nthe condemnation of mankind. The tide, upon which Mr. Parris had ridden\r\nto the destruction of so many, had turned; and it was becoming apparent\r\nto all, that[ii.468] he would soon be compelled to disappear from his\r\nministry in the village, before the awakening resentment of the people\r\nand the ministers. Francis Nurse died on the 22d of November, 1695,\r\nseventy-seven years of age. His sons with their wives, and his\r\ndaughters with their husbands, went into the Probate Court with the\r\npaper before described, and unanimously requested the judge to have the\r\nestate divided according to its terms. This is conclusive proof that\r\nthe father had been just and wise in his arrangements, and that true\r\nfraternal love and harmony pervaded the whole family. The descendants,\r\nunder the names of Bowden, Tarbell, and Russell, are dispersed in\r\nvarious parts of the country: those under the name of Preston, while\r\nsome have gone elsewhere, have been ever since, and still are, among\r\nthe most respectable and honored citizens of the village. Some of the\r\nname of Nurse have also remained, and worthily represent and perpetuate\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the tide's beginning to turn in 1695. Sure indications\r\nto that effect were then quite visible. It had begun far down in the\r\npublic mind before the prosecutions ceased; but it was long before the\r\nchange became apparent on the surface. It was long before men found\r\nutterance for their feelings.\r\n\r\nPersons living at a distance have been accustomed, and are to this day,\r\nto treat the Salem-witchcraft transaction in the spirit of lightsome\r\nridicule, and to make it the subject of jeers and jokes. Not so those\r\nwho have lived on, or near, the fatal scene. They have ever regarded it\r\nwith solemn awe and profound sorrow, and shunned the mention, and even\r\nthe remembrance, of its details. This prevented an immediate expression\r\nof feeling, and delayed movements in the way of attempting a reparation\r\nof the wrongs that had been committed. The heart sickened, the lips\r\nwere dumb, at the very thought of those wrongs. Reparation was\r\nimpossible. The dead were beyond its reach. The sorrows and anguish of\r\nsurvivors were also beyond its reach. The voice of sympathy was felt to\r\nbe unworthy to obtrude upon sensibilities that had been so outraged.\r\nThe only refuge left for the individuals who had been bereaved, and for\r\nthe body of the people who realized that innocent blood was on all\r\ntheir hands, was in humble and soul-subdued silence, and in prayers for\r\nforgiveness from God and from each other.[ii.469]\r\n\r\nIt was long before the public mind recovered from its paralysis. No one\r\nknew what ought to be said or done, the tragedy had been so awful. The\r\nparties who had acted in it were so numerous, and of such standing,\r\nincluding almost all the most eminent and honored leaders of the\r\ncommunity from the bench, the bar, the magistracy, the pulpit, the\r\nmedical faculty, and in fact all classes and descriptions of persons;\r\nthe mysteries connected with the accusers and confessors; the universal\r\nprevalence of the legal, theological, and philosophical theories that\r\nhad led to the proceedings; the utter impossibility of realizing or\r\nmeasuring the extent of the calamity; and the general shame and horror\r\nassociated with the subject in all minds; prevented any open movement.\r\nThen there was the dread of rekindling animosities which time was\r\nsilently subduing, and nothing but time could fully extinguish. Slowly,\r\nhowever, the remembrance of wrongs was becoming obscured. Neighborhood\r\nand business relations were gradually reconciling the estranged.\r\nOffices of civility, courtesy, and good-will were reviving; social and\r\nfamily intimacies and connections were taking effect and restoring the\r\ncommunity to a natural and satisfactory condition. Every day, the\r\nsentiment was sinking deeper in the public mind, that something was\r\nrequired to be done to avert the displeasure of Heaven from a guilty\r\nland. But while some were ready to forgive, and some had the grace to\r\nask to be forgiven, any general movement in this direction was\r\nobstructed by difficulties hard to be surmounted.\r\n\r\nThe wrongs committed were so remediless, the outrages upon right,\r\ncharacter, and life, had been so shocking, that it was expecting too\r\nmuch from the ordinary standard of humanity to demand a general\r\noblivion. On the other hand, so many had been responsible for them, and\r\ntheir promoters embraced such a great majority of all the leading\r\nclasses of society, that it was impossible to call them to account. Dr.\r\nBentley describes the condition of the community, in some brief and\r\npregnant sentences, characteristic of his peculiar style: \"As soon as\r\nthe judges ceased to condemn, the people ceased to accuse.... Terror at\r\nthe violence and guilt of the proceedings succeeded instantly to the\r\nconviction of blind zeal; and what every man had encouraged all\r\nprofessed to abhor. Few dared to blame other men, because[ii.470] few\r\nwere innocent. The guilt and the shame became the portion of the\r\ncountry, while Salem had the infamy of being the place of the\r\ntransactions.... After the public mind became quiet, few things were\r\ndone to disturb it. But a diminished population, the injury done to\r\nreligion, and the distress of the aggrieved, were seen and felt with\r\nthe greatest sorrow.... Every place was the subject of some direful\r\ntale. Fear haunted every street. Melancholy dwelt in silence in every\r\nplace, after the sun retired. Business could not, for some time,\r\nrecover its former channels; and the innocent suffered with the\r\nguilty.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the subject was felt to be too dark and awful to be spoken of,\r\nand most men desired to bury it in silence, occasionally the slumbering\r\nfires would rekindle, and the flames of animosity burst forth. The\r\nrecollection of the part he had acted, and the feelings of many towards\r\nhim in consequence, rendered the situation of the sheriff often quite\r\nunpleasant; and the resentment of some broke out in a shameful\r\ndemonstration at his death, which occurred early in 1697. Mr. English,\r\nrepresenting that class who had suffered under his official hands in\r\n1692, having a business demand upon him, in the shape of a suit for\r\ndebt, stood ready to seize his body after it was prepared for\r\ninterment, and prevented the funeral at the time. The body was\r\ntemporarily deposited on the sheriff's own premises. There were, it is\r\nprobable, from time to time, other less noticeable occurrences\r\nmanifesting the long continued existence of the unhappy state of\r\nfeeling engendered in 1692. There were really two parties in the\r\ncommunity, generally both quiescent, but sometimes coming into open\r\ncollision; the one exasperated by the wrongs they and their friends had\r\nsuffered, the other determined not to allow those who had acted in\r\nconducting the prosecutions to be called to account for what they had\r\ndone. After the lapse of thirty years, and long subsequent to the death\r\nof Mr. Noyes, Mr. English was prosecuted for having said that Mr. Noyes\r\nhad murdered Rebecca Nurse and John Procter.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested, that the bearing of the executive officers of\r\nthe law towards the prisoners was often quite harsh. This resulted from\r\nthe general feeling, in which these officials would have been likely to\r\nsympathize, of the peculiarly execrable nature of the crime charged\r\nupon the accused, and from the danger that[ii.471] might attend the\r\nmanifestation of any appearance of kindly regard for them. So far as\r\nthe seizure of goods is considered, or the exaction of fees, the\r\nconduct of the officials was in conformity with usage and instructions.\r\nThe system of the administration of the law, compared with our times,\r\nwas stern, severe, and barbarous. The whole tone of society was more\r\nunfeeling. Philanthropy had not then extended its operations, or\r\ndirected its notice, to the prison. Sheriff Corwin was quite a young\r\nman, being but twenty-six years of age at the time of his appointment.\r\nHe probably acted under the advice of his relatives and connections on\r\nthe bench. I think there is no evidence of any particular cruelty\r\nevinced by him. The arrests, examinations, and imprisonments had taken\r\nplace under his predecessor, Marshal Herrick, who continued in the\r\nservice as his deputy.\r\n\r\nThat individual, indeed, had justly incurred the resentment of the\r\nsufferers and their friends, by eager zeal in urging on the\r\nprosecutions, perpetual officiousness, and unwarrantable interference\r\nagainst the prisoners at the preliminary examinations. The odium\r\noriginally attached to the marshal seems to have been transferred to\r\nhis successor, and the whole was laid at the door of the sheriff.\r\nMarshal Herrick does not appear to have been connected with Joseph\r\nHerrick, who lived on what is now called Cherry Hill, but was a man of\r\nan entirely different stamp. He was thirty-four years of age, and had\r\nnot been very long in the country. John Dunton speaks of meeting him in\r\nSalem, in 1686, and describes him as a \"very tall, handsome man, very\r\nregular and devout in his attendance at church, religious without\r\nbigotry, and having every man's good word.\" His impatient activity\r\nagainst the victims of the witchcraft delusion wrought a great change\r\nin the condition of this popular and \"handsome\" man, as is seen in a\r\npetition presented by him, Dec. 8, 1692; to \"His Excellency Sir William\r\nPhips, Knight, Captain-general and Governor of Their Majesties'\r\nTerritories and Dominions of Massachusetts Bay in New England; and to\r\nthe Honorable William Stoughton, Esq., Deputy-Governor; and to the rest\r\nof the Honored Council.\" It begins thus: \"The petition of your poor\r\nservant, George Herrick, most humbly showeth.\" After recounting his\r\ngreat and various services \"for the term of nine months,\" as marshal or\r\ndeputy-sheriff in apprehending many prisoners, and conveying[ii.472]\r\nthem \"unto prison and from prison to prison,\" he complains that his\r\nwhole time had been taken up so that he was incapable of getting any\r\nthing for the maintenance of his \"poor family:\" he further states that\r\nhe had become so impoverished that necessity had forced him to lay down\r\nhis place; and that he must certainly come to want, if not in some\r\nmeasure supplied. \"Therefore I humbly beseech Your Honors to take my\r\ncase and condition so far into consideration, that I may have some\r\nsupply this hard winter, that I and my poor children may not be\r\ndestitute of sustenance, and so inevitably perish; for I have been bred\r\na gentleman, and not much used to work, and am become despicable in\r\nthese hard times.\" He concludes by declaring, that he is not \"weary of\r\nserving his king and country,\" nor very scrupulous as to the kind of\r\nservice; for he promises that \"if his habitation\" could thereby be\r\n\"graced with plenty in the room of penury, there shall be no services\r\ntoo dangerous and difficult, but your poor petitioner will gladly\r\naccept, and to the best of my power accomplish. I shall wholly lay\r\nmyself at Your Honorable feet for relief.\" Marshal Herrick died in\r\n1695.\r\n\r\nBut, while this feeling was spreading among the people, the government\r\nwere doing their best to check it. There was great apprehension, that,\r\nif allowed to gather force, it would burst over all barriers, that no\r\nlimit would be put to its demands for the restoration of property\r\nseized by the officers of the law, and that it would wreak vengeance\r\nupon all who had been engaged in the prosecutions. Under the influence\r\nof this fear, the following attempt was made to shield the sheriff of\r\nthe county from prosecutions for damages by those whose relatives had\r\nsuffered:—\r\n\r\n\"_At a Superior Court of Judicature, Court of Assize, and General Jail\r\nDelivery, held at Ipswich, the fifteenth day of May, anno Domini\r\n1694._—Present, William Stoughton, Esq., _Chief-justice_; Thomas\r\nDanforth, Esq.; Samuel Sewall, Esq.\r\n\r\n\"This Court, having adjusted the accounts of George Corwin, Esq.,\r\nhigh-sheriff for the county of Essex, do allow the same to be just and\r\ntrue; and that there remains a balance due to him, the said Corwin, of\r\n£67. 6_s._ 4_d._, which is also allowed unto him; and, pursuant to law,\r\nthis Court doth fully, clearly, and absolutely acquit and discharge\r\nhim,[ii.473] the said George Corwin, his heirs, executors, and\r\nadministrators, lands and tenements, goods and chattels, of and from\r\nall manner of sum or sums of money, goods or chattels levied, received,\r\nor seized, and of all debts, duties, and demands which are or may be\r\ncharged in his, the said Corwin's, accounts, or which may be imposed by\r\nreason of the sheriff's office, or any thing by him done by virtue\r\nthereof, or in the execution of the same, from the time he entered into\r\nthe said office, to this Court.\"\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary attempt of the Court to close the doors of justice\r\nbeforehand against suits for damages did not seem to have any effect;\r\nfor Mr. English compelled the executors of the sheriff to pay over to\r\nhim £60. 3_s_.\r\n\r\nAt length, the government had to meet the public feeling. A\r\nproclamation was issued, \"By the Honorable the Lieutenant-Governor,\r\nCouncil, and Assembly of His Majesty's province of the Massachusetts\r\nBay, in General Court assembled.\" It begins thus: \"Whereas the anger of\r\nGod is not yet turned away, but his hand is still stretched out against\r\nhis people in manifold judgments;\" and, after several specifications of\r\nthe calamities under which they were suffering, and referring to the\r\n\"many days of public and solemn\" addresses made to God, it proceeds:\r\n\"Yet we cannot but also fear that there is something still wanting to\r\naccompany our supplications; and doubtless there are some particular\r\nsins which God is angry with our Israel for, that have not been duly\r\nseen and resented by us, about which God expects to be sought, if ever\r\nhe again turn our captivity.\" Thursday, the fourteenth of the next\r\nJanuary, was accordingly appointed to be observed as a day of prayer\r\nand fasting,—\r\n\r\n\"That so all God's people may offer up fervent supplications unto him,\r\nthat all iniquity may be put away, which hath stirred God's holy\r\njealousy against this land; that he would show us what we know not, and\r\nhelp us, wherein we have done amiss, to do so no more; and especially,\r\nthat, whatever mistakes on either hand have been fallen into, either by\r\nthe body of this people or any orders of men, referring to the late\r\ntragedy, raised among us by Satan and his instruments, through the\r\nawful judgment of God, he would humble us therefor, and pardon all the\r\nerrors of his servants and people that desire to love his name; that he\r\nwould remove the rod of the wicked from off the lot of the[ii.474]\r\nrighteous; that he would bring in the American heathen, and cause them\r\nto hear and obey his voice.\r\n\r\n\"Given at Boston, Dec. 17, 1696, in the eighth year of His Majesty's\r\nreign.\r\n\r\nIsaac Addington, _Secretary_.\"\r\n\r\nThe jury had acted in conformity with their obligations and honest\r\nconvictions of duty in bringing in their verdicts. They had sworn to\r\ndecide according to the law and the evidence. The law under which they\r\nwere required to act was laid down with absolute positiveness by the\r\nCourt. They were bound to receive it, and to take and weigh the\r\nevidence that was admitted; and to their minds it was clear, decisive,\r\nand overwhelming, offered by persons of good character, and confirmed\r\nby a great number of confessions. If it had been within their province,\r\nas it always is declared not to be, to discuss the general principles,\r\nand sit in judgment on the particular penalties of law, it would not\r\nhave altered the case; for, at that time, not only the common people,\r\nbut the wisest philosophers, supported the interpretation of the law\r\nthat acknowledged the existence of witchcraft, and its sanction that\r\nvisited it with death.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, however, so tender and sensitive were the\r\nconsciences of the jurors, that they signed and circulated the\r\nfollowing humble and solemn declaration of regret for the part they had\r\nborne in the trials. As the publication of this paper was highly\r\nhonorable to those who signed it, and cannot but be contemplated with\r\nsatisfaction by all their descendants, I will repeat their names:—\r\n\r\n\"We whose names are underwritten, being in the year 1692 called to\r\nserve as jurors in court at Salem, on trial of many who were by some\r\nsuspected guilty of doing acts of witchcraft upon the bodies of sundry\r\npersons,—we confess that we ourselves were not capable to understand,\r\nnor able to withstand, the mysterious delusions of the powers of\r\ndarkness and Prince of the air, but were, for want of knowledge in\r\nourselves and better information from others, prevailed with to take up\r\nwith such evidence against the accused as, on further consideration and\r\nbetter information, we justly fear was insufficient for the touching\r\nthe lives of any (Deut. xvii. 6), whereby we fear we have been\r\ninstrumental, with others, though ignorantly and unwittingly, to bring\r\nupon ourselves and this people of the Lord the guilt of innocent blood;\r\nwhich sin the Lord saith in Scripture he would not pardon[ii.475] (2\r\nKings xxiv. 4),—that is, we suppose, in regard of his temporal\r\njudgments. We do therefore hereby signify to all in general, and to the\r\nsurviving sufferers in special, our deep sense of, and sorrow for, our\r\nerrors in acting on such evidence to the condemning of any person; and\r\ndo hereby declare, that we justly fear that we were sadly deluded and\r\nmistaken,—for which we are much disquieted and distressed in our minds,\r\nand do therefore humbly beg forgiveness, first, of God, for Christ's\r\nsake, for this our error, and pray that God would not impute the guilt\r\nof it to ourselves nor others: and we also pray that we may be\r\nconsidered candidly and aright by the living sufferers, as being then\r\nunder the power of a strong and general delusion, utterly unacquainted\r\nwith, and not experienced in, matters of that nature.\r\n\r\n\"We do heartily ask forgiveness of you all, whom we have justly\r\noffended; and do declare, according to our present minds, we would none\r\nof us do such things again, on such grounds, for the whole\r\nworld,—praying you to accept of this in way of satisfaction for our\r\noffence, and that you would bless the inheritance of the Lord, that he\r\nmay be entreated for the land.\r\n\r\n\"Thomas Fisk, _Foreman_.

Henry Herrick,\r\nSr.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1697, Rev. John Hale, of Beverly, published a work on the subject of\r\nthe witchcraft persecutions, in which he gives the reasons which led\r\nhim to the conclusion that there was error at the foundation of the\r\nproceedings. The following extract shows that he took a rational view\r\nof the subject:—\r\n\r\n\"It may be queried then, How doth it appear that there was a going too\r\nfar in this affair?\r\n\r\n\"Answer I.—By the number of persons accused. It cannot be imagined,\r\nthat, in a place of so much knowledge, so many, in so small a compass\r\nof land, should so abominably leap into the Devil's lap,—at once.\r\n\r\n\"Ans. II.—The quality of several of the accused was such as did bespeak\r\nbetter things, and things that accompany salvation. Persons whose\r\nblameless and holy lives before did testify for them; persons that had\r\ntaken great pains to bring up _their children in the nurture and\r\nadmonition of the Lord_, such as we had charity for as for our[ii.476]\r\nown souls,—and charity is a Christian duty, commended to us in 1 Cor.\r\nxiii., Col. iii. 14, and many other places.\r\n\r\n\"Ans. III.—The number of the afflicted by Satan daily increased, till\r\nabout fifty persons were thus vexed by the Devil. This gave just ground\r\nto suspect some mistake.\r\n\r\n\"Ans. IV.—It was considerable, that nineteen were executed, and all\r\ndenied the crime to the death; and some of them were knowing persons,\r\nand had before this been accounted blameless livers. And it is not to\r\nbe imagined but that, if all had been guilty, some would have had so\r\nmuch tenderness as to seek mercy for their souls in the way of\r\nconfession, and sorrow for such a sin.\r\n\r\n\"Ans. V.—When this prosecution ceased, the Lord so chained up Satan,\r\nthat the afflicted grew presently well: the accused are generally\r\nquiet, and for five years since we have no such molestation by them.\"\r\n\r\nSuch reasonings as these found their way into the minds of the whole\r\ncommunity; and it became the melancholy conviction of all candid and\r\nconsiderate persons that innocent blood had been shed. Standing where\r\nwe do, with the lights that surround us, we look back upon the whole\r\nscene as an awful perversion of justice, reason, and truth.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of June, 1700, Abigail Faulkner presented a well-expressed\r\nmemorial to the General Court, in which she says that her pardon \"so\r\nfar had its effect, as that I am yet suffered to live, but this only as\r\na malefactor convict upon record of the most heinous crimes that\r\nmankind can be supposed to be guilty of;\" and prays for \"the defacing\r\nof the record\" against her. She claims it as no more than a simple act\r\nof justice; stating that the evidence against her was wholly confined\r\nto the \"afflicted, who pretended to see me by their spectral sight, and\r\nnot with their bodily eyes.\" That \"the jury (upon only their testimony)\r\nbrought me in 'Guilty,' and the sentence of death was passed upon me;\"\r\nand that it had been decided that such testimony was of no value. The\r\nHouse of Representatives felt the force of her appeal, and voted that\r\n\"the prayer of the petitioner be granted.\" The council declined to\r\nconcur, but addressed \"His Excellency to grant the petitioner His\r\nMajesty's gracious pardon; and His Excellency expressed His readiness\r\nto grant the same.\" Some adverse influence, it seemed, prevailed to\r\nprevent it.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of March, 1702, another petition was presented to[ii.477]\r\nthe General Court, by persons of Andover, Salem Village, and Topsfield,\r\nwho had suffered imprisonment and condemnation, and by the relations of\r\nothers who had been condemned and executed on the testimony, as they\r\nsay, of \"possessed persons,\" to this effect:—\r\n\r\n\"Your petitioners being dissatisfied and grieved that (besides what the\r\ncondemned persons have suffered in their persons and estates) their\r\nnames are exposed to infamy and reproach, while their trial and\r\ncondemnation stands upon public record, we therefore humbly pray this\r\nhonored Court that something may be publicly done to take off infamy\r\nfrom the names and memory of those who have suffered as aforesaid, that\r\nnone of their surviving relations nor their posterity may suffer\r\nreproach on that account.\"\r\n\r\n[Signed by Francis Faulkner, Isaac Easty, Thorndike Procter, and\r\neighteen others.]\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of July, in answer to the foregoing petitions, a bill was\r\nordered by the House of Representatives to be drawn up, forbidding in\r\nfuture such procedures, as in the witchcraft trials of 1692; declaring\r\nthat \"no spectre evidence may hereafter be accounted valid or\r\nsufficient to take away the life or good name of any person or persons\r\nwithin this province, and that the infamy and reproach cast on the\r\nnames and posterity of said accused and condemned persons may in some\r\nmeasure be rolled away.\" The council concurred with an additional\r\nclause, to acquit all condemned persons \"of the penalties to which they\r\nare liable upon the convictions and judgments in the courts, and estate\r\nthem in their just credit and reputation, as if no such judgment had\r\nbeen had.\"\r\n\r\nThis petition was re-enforced by an \"address\" to the General Court,\r\ndated July 8, 1703, by several ministers of the county of Essex. They\r\nspeak of the accusers in the witchcraft trials as \"young persons under\r\ndiabolical molestations,\" and express this sentiment: \"There is great\r\nreason to fear that innocent persons then suffered, and that God may\r\nhave a controversy with the land upon that account.\" They earnestly beg\r\nthat the prayer of the petitioners, lately presented, may be granted.\r\nThis petition was signed by Thomas Barnard, of Andover; Joseph Green,\r\nof Salem Village; William Hubbard, John Wise, John Rogers, and\r\nJabez[ii.478] Fitch, of Ipswich; Benjamin Rolfe, of Haverhill; Samuel\r\nCheever, of Marblehead; Joseph Gerrish, of Wenham; Joseph Capen, of\r\nTopsfield; Zechariah Symmes, of Bradford; and Thomas Symmes, of\r\nBoxford. Francis Dane, of Andover, had died six years before. John\r\nHale, of Beverly, had died three years before. The great age of John\r\nHigginson, of Salem,—eighty-seven years,—probably prevented the papers\r\nbeing handed to him. It is observable, that Nicholas Noyes, his\r\ncolleague, is not among the signers.\r\n\r\nWhat prevented action, we do not know; but nothing was done. Six years\r\nafterwards, on the 25th of May, 1709, an \"humble address\" was presented\r\nto the General Court by certain inhabitants of the province, some of\r\nwhom \"had their near relations, either parents or others, who suffered\r\ndeath in the dark and doleful times that passed over this province in\r\n1692;\" and others \"who themselves, or some of their relations, were\r\nimprisoned, impaired and blasted in their reputations and estates by\r\nreason of the same.\" They pray for the passage of a \"suitable act\" to\r\nrestore the reputations of the sufferers, and to make some remuneration\r\n\"as to what they have been damnified in their estates thereby.\" This\r\npaper was signed by Philip English and twenty-one others. Philip\r\nEnglish gave in an account in detail of what articles were seized and\r\ncarried away, at the time of his arrest, from four of his warehouses,\r\nhis wharf, and shop-house, besides the expenses incurred in prison, and\r\nin escaping from it. It appears by this statement, that he and his wife\r\nwere nine weeks in jail at Salem and Boston. Nothing was done at this\r\nsession. The next year, Sept. 12, 1710, Isaac Easty presented a strong\r\nmemorial to the General Court in reference to his case. He calls for\r\nsome remuneration. In speaking of the arrest and execution of his\r\n\"beloved wife,\" he says \"my sorrow and trouble of heart in being\r\ndeprived of her in such a manner, which this world can never make me\r\nany compensation for.\" At the same time, the daughters of Elizabeth\r\nHow, the son of Sarah Wildes, the heirs of Mary Bradbury, Edward Bishop\r\nand his wife Sarah, sent in severally similar petitions,—all in earnest\r\nand forcible language. Charles, one of the sons of George Burroughs,\r\npresented the case of his \"dear and honored father;\" declaring that his\r\ninnocence of the crime of which he was accused, and his excellence of\r\ncharacter, were shown in \"his careful catechising his children, and\r\nupholding[ii.479] religion in his family, and by his solemn and savory\r\nwritten instructions from prison.\" He describes in affecting details\r\nthe condition in which his father's family of little children was left\r\nat his death. One of Mr. Burroughs's daughters, upon being required to\r\nsign a paper in reference to compensation, expresses her distress of\r\nmind in these words: \"Every discourse on this melancholy subject doth\r\nbut give a fresh wound to my bleeding heart. I desire to sit down in\r\nsilence.\" John Moulton, in behalf of the family of Giles Corey, says\r\nthat they \"cannot sufficiently express their grief\" for the death, in\r\nsuch a manner, of \"their honored father and mother.\" Samuel Nurse, in\r\nbehalf of his brothers and sisters, says that their \"honored and dear\r\nmother had led a blameless life from her youth up.... Her name and the\r\nname of her posterity lies under reproach, the removing of which\r\nreproach is the principal thing wherein we desire restitution. And, as\r\nwe know not how to express our loss of such a mother in such a way, so\r\nwe know not how to compute our charge, but leave it to the judgment of\r\nothers, and shall not be critical.\" He distinctly intimates, that they\r\ndo not wish any money to be paid them, unless \"the attainder is taken\r\noff.\" Many other petitions were presented by the families of those who\r\nsuffered, all in the same spirit; and several besides the Nurses\r\ninsisted mainly upon the \"taking off the attainder.\"\r\n\r\nThe General Court, on the 17th of October, 1710, passed an act, that\r\n\"the several convictions, judgments, and attainders be, and hereby are,\r\nreversed, and declared to be null and void.\" In simple justice, they\r\nought to have extended the act to all who had suffered; but they\r\nconfined its effect to those in reference to whom petitions had been\r\npresented. The families of some of them had disappeared, or may not\r\nhave had notice of what was going on; so that the sentence which the\r\nGovernment acknowledged to have been unjust remains to this day\r\nunreversed against the names and memory of Bridget Bishop, Susanna\r\nMartin, Alice Parker, Ann Pudeator, Wilmot Read, and Margaret Scott.\r\nThe stain on the records of the Commonwealth has never been fully\r\neffaced. What caused this dilatory and halting course on the part of\r\nthe Government, and who was responsible for it, cannot be ascertained.\r\nSince the presentation of Abigail Faulkner's petition in 1700, the\r\nLegislature, in the popular branch at least, and the[ii.480] Governor,\r\nappear to have been inclined to act favorably in the premises; but some\r\npower blocked the way. There is some reason to conjecture that it was\r\nthe influence of the home government. Its consent to have the\r\nprosecutions suspended, in 1692, was not very cordial, but, while it\r\napproved of \"care and circumspection therein,\" expressed reluctance to\r\nallow any \"impediment to the ordinary course of justice.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of December, 1711, Governor Dudley issued his warrant for\r\nthe purpose of carrying out a vote of the \"General Assembly,\" \"by and\r\nwith the advice and consent of Her Majesty's Council,\" to pay \"the sum\r\nof £578. 12_s._\" to \"such persons as are living, and to those that\r\nlegally represent them that are dead;\" which sum was divided as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\nJohn Procter and wife     £     150     0     0 George Jacobs     \r\n     79     0     0 George Burroughs           50     0     0 Sarah\r\nGood          30     0     0 Giles Corey and wife           21     0     0\r\nDorcas Hoar           21     17     0 Abigail Hobbs           10     0     0\r\nRebecca Eames           10     0     0 Mary Post           8     14     0 Mary\r\nLacy           8     10     0 Ann Foster           6     10     0 Samuel\r\nWardwell and wife           36     15     0 Rebecca Nurse     \r\n     25     0     0 Mary Easty           20     0     0 Mary Bradbury     \r\n     20     0     0 Abigail Faulkner           20     0     0 John Willard     \r\n     20     0     0 Sarah Wildes           14     0     0 Elizabeth How     \r\n     12     0     0 Mary Parker           8     0     0 Martha Carrier     \r\n     7     6     0 — £ ==     —— 578 ====     — 12 ==     — 0 ==\r\n\r\nThe distribution, as above, according to the evidence as it has come\r\ndown to us, is as unjust and absurd as the smallness of the[ii.481]\r\namount, and the long delay before it was ordered, are discreditable to\r\nthe province. One of the larger sums was allowed to William Good, while\r\nhe clearly deserved nothing, as he was an adverse witness in the\r\nexamination of his wife, and did what he could to promote the\r\nprosecution against her. He did not, it is true, swear that he believed\r\nher to be a witch; but what he said tended to prejudice the magistrates\r\nand the public against her. Benjamin Putnam acted as his attorney, and\r\nreceived the money for him. Good was a retainer and dependant of that\r\nbranch of the Putnam family; and its influence gave him so large a\r\nproportionate amount, and not the reason or equity of the case. More\r\nwas allowed to Abigail Hobbs, a very malignant witness against the\r\nprisoners, than to the families of several who were executed. Nearly\r\ntwice as much was allowed for Abigail Faulkner, who was pardoned, as\r\nfor Elizabeth How, who was executed. The sums allowed in the cases of\r\nParker, Carrier, and Foster, were shamefully small. The public mind\r\nevidently was not satisfied; and the Legislature were pressed for a\r\nhalf-century to make more adequate compensation, and thereby vindicate\r\nthe sentiment of justice, and redeem the honor of the province.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of December, 1738, Major Samuel Sewall, a son of the Judge,\r\nintroduced an order in the House of Representatives for the appointment\r\nof a committee to get information relating to \"the circumstances of the\r\npersons and families who suffered in the calamity of the times in and\r\nabout the year 1692.\" Major Sewall entered into the matter with great\r\nzeal. The House unanimously passed the order. He was chairman of the\r\ncommittee; and, on the 9th of December, wrote to his cousin Mitchel\r\nSewall in Salem, son of Stephen, earnestly requesting him and John\r\nHigginson, Esq., to aid in accomplishing the object. The following is\r\nan extract from a speech delivered by Governor Belcher to both Houses\r\nof the Legislature, Nov. 22, 1740. It is honorable to his memory.\r\n\r\n\"The Legislature have often honored themselves in a kind and generous\r\nremembrance of such families and of the posterity of such as have been\r\nsufferers, either in their persons or estates, for or by the\r\nGovernment, of which the public records will give you many instances. I\r\nshould therefore be glad there might be a committee appointed by this\r\nCourt to inquire into the sufferings of the people called Quakers, in\r\nthe early days of this country, as also into the descendants of\r\nsuch[ii.482] families as were in a manner ruined in the mistaken\r\nmanagement of the terrible affair called witchcraft. I really think\r\nthere is something incumbent on this Government to be done for\r\nrelieving the estates and reputations of the posterities of the unhappy\r\nfamilies that so suffered; and the doing it, though so long afterwards,\r\nwould doubtless be acceptable to Almighty God, and would reflect honor\r\nupon the present Legislature.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of May, 1749, the heirs of George Burroughs addressed a\r\npetition to Governor Shirley and the General Court, setting forth \"the\r\nunparalleled persecutions and sufferings\" of their ancestor, and\r\npraying for \"some recompense from this Court for the losses thereby\r\nsustained by his family.\" It was referred to a committee of both\r\nHouses. The next year, the petitioners sent a memorial to Governor\r\nSpencer Phips and the General Court, stating, that \"it hath fell out,\r\nthat the Hon. Mr. Danforth, chairman of the said committee, had not, as\r\nyet, called them together so much as once to act thereon, even to this\r\nday, as some of the honorable committee themselves were pleased, with\r\nreal concern, to signify to your said petitioners.\" The House\r\nimmediately passed this order: \"That the committee within referred to\r\nbe directed to sit forthwith, consider the petition to them committed,\r\nand report as soon as may be.\"\r\n\r\nAll that I have been able to find, as the result of these long-delayed\r\nand long-protracted movements, is a statement of Dr. Bentley, that the\r\nheirs of Philip English received two hundred pounds. He does not say\r\nwhen the act to this effect was passed. Perhaps some general measure of\r\nthe kind was adopted, the record of which I have failed to meet. The\r\nengrossing interest of the then pending French war, and of the vehement\r\ndissensions that led to the Revolution, probably prevented any further\r\nattention to this subject, after the middle of the last century.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent from the foregoing statements and records, that while\r\nmany individuals, the people generally, and finally Governor Belcher\r\nand the House of Representatives emphatically, did what they could,\r\nthere was an influence that prevailed to prevent for a long time, if\r\nnot for ever, any action of the province to satisfy the demands made by\r\njustice and the honor of the country in repairing the great wrongs\r\ncommitted by the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the\r\nGovernment in 1692. The only bodies[ii.483] of men who fully came up to\r\ntheir duty on the occasion were the clergy of the county, and, as will\r\nappear, the church at Salem Village.\r\n\r\nWhat was done by the First Church in Salem is shown in the following\r\nextract from its records:—\r\n\r\n\"March 2, 1712.—After the sacrament, a church-meeting was appointed to\r\nbe at the teacher's house, at two of the clock in the afternoon, on the\r\nsixth of the month, being Thursday: on which day they accordingly met\r\nto consider of the several following particulars propounded to them by\r\nthe teacher; viz.:—\r\n\r\n\"1. Whether the record of the excommunication of our Sister Nurse (all\r\nthings considered) may not be erased and blotted out. The result of\r\nwhich consideration was, That whereas, on July 3d, 1692, it was\r\nproposed by the Elders, and consented to by an unanimous vote of the\r\nchurch, that our Sister Nurse should be excommunicated, she being\r\nconvicted of witchcraft by the Court, and she was accordingly\r\nexcommunicated, since which the General Court having taken off the\r\nattainder, and the testimony on which she was convicted being not now\r\nso satisfactory to ourselves and others as it was generally in that\r\nhour of darkness and temptation; and we being solicited by her son, Mr.\r\nSamuel Nurse, to erase and blot out of the church records the sentence\r\nof her excommunication,—this church, having the matter proposed to them\r\nby the teacher, and having seriously considered it, doth consent that\r\nthe record of our Sister Nurse's excommunication be accordingly erased\r\nand blotted out, that it may no longer be a reproach to her memory, and\r\nan occasion of grief to her children. Humbly requesting that the\r\nmerciful God would pardon whatsoever sin, error, or mistake was in the\r\napplication of that censure and of that whole affair, through our\r\nmerciful High-priest, who knoweth how to have compassion on the\r\nignorant, and those that are out of the way.\r\n\r\n\"2. It was proposed whether the sentence of excommunication against our\r\nBrother Giles Corey (all things considered) may not be erased and\r\nblotted out. The result was, That whereas, on Sept. 18, 1692, it was\r\nconsidered by the church, that our Brother Giles Corey stood accused of\r\nand indicted for the sin of witchcraft, and that he had obstinately\r\nrefused to plead, and so threw himself on certain death. It was agreed\r\nby the vote of the church, that he should be excommunicated for it; and\r\naccordingly he was excommunicated. Yet the church, having now testimony\r\nin his behalf, that, before his death, he did bitterly repent of his\r\nobstinate refusal to plead in defence[ii.484] of his life, do consent\r\nthat the sentence of his excommunication be erased and blotted out.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that these proceedings were not had at a regular\r\npublic meeting, but at a private meeting of the church, on a week-day\r\nafternoon, at the teacher's house. The motives that led to them were a\r\ndisposition to comply with the act of the General Court, and the\r\nsolicitations of Mr. Samuel Nurse, rather than a profound sense of\r\nwrong done to a venerable member of their own body, who had claims upon\r\ntheir protection as such. The language of the record does not frankly\r\nadmit absolutely that there was sin, error, or mistake, but requests\r\nforgiveness for whatsoever there may have been. The character of\r\nRebecca Nurse, and the outrageous treatment she had received from that\r\nchurch, in the method arranged for her excommunication, demanded\r\nsomething more than these hypothetical expressions, with such a\r\npreamble.\r\n\r\nThe statement made in the vote about Corey is, on its face, a\r\nmisrepresentation. From the nature of the proceeding by which he was\r\ndestroyed, it was in his power, at any moment, if he \"repented of his\r\nobstinate refusal to plead,\" by saying so, to be instantly released\r\nfrom the pressure that was crushing him. The only design of the torture\r\nwas to make him bring it to an end by \"answering\" guilty, or not\r\nguilty. Somebody fabricated the slander that Corey's resolution broke\r\ndown under his agonies, and that he bitterly repented; and Mr. Noyes\r\nput the foolish scandal upon the records of the church.\r\n\r\nThe date of this transaction is disreputable to the people of Salem.\r\nTwenty years had been suffered to elapse, and a great outrage allowed\r\nto remain unacknowledged and unrepented. The credit of doing what was\r\ndone at last probably belongs to the Rev. George Corwin. His call to\r\nthe ministry, as colleague with Mr. Noyes, had just been consummated.\r\nThe introduction of a new minister heralded a new policy, and the\r\nproceedings have the appearance of growing out of the kindly and\r\nauspicious feelings which generally attend and welcome such an era.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. George, son of Jonathan Corwin, was born May 21, 1683, and\r\ngraduated at Harvard College in 1701. Mr. Barnard, of Marblehead,\r\ndescribes his character: \"The spirit of[ii.485] early devotion,\r\naccompanied with a natural freedom of thought and easy elocution, a\r\nquick invention, a solid judgment, and a tenacious memory, laid the\r\nfoundation of a good preacher; to which his acquired literature, his\r\ngreat reading, hard studies, deep meditation, and close walk with God,\r\nrendered him an able and faithful minister of the New Testament.\" The\r\nrecords of the First Church, in noticing his death, thus speak of him:\r\n\"He was highly esteemed in his life, and very deservedly lamented at\r\nhis death; having been very eminent for his early improvement in\r\nlearning and piety, his singular abilities and great labors, his\r\nremarkable zeal and faithfulness. He was a great benefactor to our\r\npoor.\" Those bearing the name of Curwen among us are his descendants.\r\nHe died Nov. 23, 1717.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Nicholas Noyes died Dec. 13, 1717. He was a person of superior\r\ntalents and learning. He published, with the sermon preached by Cotton\r\nMather on the occasion, a poem on the death of his venerable colleague,\r\nMr. Higginson, in 1708; and also a poem on the death of Rev. Joseph\r\nGreen, in 1715. Although an amiable and benevolent man in other\r\nrespects, it cannot be denied that he was misled by his errors and his\r\ntemperament into the most violent course in the witchcraft\r\nprosecutions; and it is to be feared that his feelings were never\r\nwholly rectified in reference to that transaction.\r\n\r\nJonathan, the father of the Rev. George Corwin, and whose part as a\r\nmagistrate and judge in the examinations and trials of 1692 has been\r\nseen, died on the 9th of July, 1718, seventy-eight years of age.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to record the course of the village church and people\r\nin reference to the events of 1692. After six persons, including\r\nRebecca Nurse, had suffered death; and while five others, George\r\nBurroughs, John Procter, John Willard, George Jacobs, and Martha\r\nCarrier, were awaiting their execution, which was to take place on the\r\ncoming Friday, Aug. 19,—the facts, related as follows by Mr. Parris in\r\nhis record-book, occurred:—\r\n\r\n\"Sabbath-day, 14th August, 1692.—The church was stayed after the\r\ncongregation was dismissed, and the pastor spake to the church after\r\nthis manner:—\r\n\r\n\"'Brethren, you may all have taken notice, that, several sacrament days\r\npast, our brother Peter Cloyse, and Samuel Nurse and his wife,[ii.486]\r\nand John Tarbell and his wife, have absented from communion with us at\r\nthe Lord's Table, yea, have very rarely, except our brother Samuel\r\nNurse, been with us in common public worship: now, it is needful that\r\nthe church send some persons to them to know the reason of their\r\nabsence. Therefore, if you be so minded, express yourselves.'\r\n\r\n\"None objected. But a general or universal vote, after some discourse,\r\npassed, that Brother Nathaniel Putnam and the two deacons should join\r\nwith the pastor to discourse with the said absenters about it.\r\n\r\n\"31st August.—Brother Tarbell proves sick, unmeet for discourse;\r\nBrother Cloyse hard to be found at home, being often with his wife in\r\nprison at Ipswich for witchcraft; and Brother Nurse, and sometimes his\r\nwife, attends our public meeting, and he the sacrament, 11th September,\r\n1692: upon all which we choose to wait further.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it is remembered that the individuals aimed at all belonged to the\r\nfamily of Rebecca Nurse, whose execution had taken place three weeks\r\nbefore under circumstances with which Mr. Parris had been so\r\nprominently and responsibly connected, this proceeding must be felt by\r\nevery person of ordinary human sensibilities to have been cruel,\r\nbarbarous, and unnatural. Parris made the entry in his book, as he\r\noften did, some time after the transaction, as the inserted date of\r\nSept. 11, shows. What his object was in commencing disciplinary\r\ntreatment of this distressed family is not certain. It may be that he\r\nwas preparing to get up such a feeling against them as would make it\r\nsafe to have the \"afflicted\" cry out upon some of them. Or it may be\r\nthat he wished to get them out of his church, to avoid the possibility\r\nof their proceeding against him, by ecclesiastical methods, at some\r\nfuture day. He could not, however, bring his church to continue the\r\nprocess. This is the first indication that the brethren were no longer\r\nto be relied on by him to go all lengths, and that some remnants of\r\ngood feeling and good sense were to be found among them.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Parris was determined not to allow the public feeling against\r\npersons charged with witchcraft to subside, if he could help it; and he\r\nmade one more effort to renew the vehemence of the prosecutions. He\r\nprepared and preached two sermons, on the 11th of September, from the\r\ntext, Rev. xvii. 14: \"These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb\r\nshall overcome them: for he is[ii.487] Lord of lords, and King of\r\nkings; and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful.\"\r\nThey are entitled, \"The Devil and his instruments will be warring\r\nagainst Christ and his followers.\" This note is added, \"After the\r\ncondemnation of six witches at a court at Salem, one of the witches,\r\nviz., Martha Corey, in full communion with our church.\" The following\r\nis a portion of \"the improvement\" in the application of these\r\ndiscourses:—\r\n\r\n\"It may serve to reprove such as seem to be so amazed at the war the\r\nDevil has raised amongst us by wizards and witches, against the Lamb\r\nand his followers, that they altogether deny it. If ever there were\r\nwitches, men and women in covenant with the Devil, here are multitudes\r\nin New England. Nor is it so strange a thing that there should be such;\r\nno, nor that some church-members should be such. Pious Bishop Hall\r\nsaith, 'The Devil's prevalency in this age is most clear in the\r\nmarvellous number of witches abounding in all places. Now hundreds\r\n(says he) are discovered in one shire; and, if fame deceive us not, in\r\na village of fourteen houses in the north are found so many of this\r\ndamned brood. Heretofore, only barbarous deserts had them; but now the\r\ncivilized and religious parts are frequently pestered with them.\r\nHeretofore, some silly, ignorant old woman, &c.; but now we have known\r\nthose of both sexes who professed much knowledge, holiness, and\r\ndevotion, drawn into this damnable practice.'\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing extract is important as showing that some persons at the\r\nvillage had begun to express their disbelief of the witchcraft doctrine\r\nof Mr. Parris, \"altogether denying it.\" The title and drift of the\r\nsermons in connection with the date, and his proceedings, the month\r\nbefore, against Samuel Nurse, Tarbell, and Cloyse, members of his\r\nchurch, give color to the idea that he was designing to have them\r\n\"cried out\" against, and thus disposed of. It is a noticeable fact,\r\nthat, about this time, Cotton Mather was also laying his plans for a\r\nrenewal, or rather continuance, of witchcraft prosecutions. Nine days\r\nafter these sermons were preached by Parris, Mather wrote the following\r\nletter to Stephen Sewall of Salem:—\r\n\r\nBoston, Sept. 20, 1692.\r\n\r\nMy dear and my very obliging Stephen,—It is my hap to be continually\r\n... with all sorts of objections, and objectors against the ... work\r\nnow doing at Salem; and it is my further good hap to do some little\r\nservice for God and you in my encounters.[ii.488]\r\n\r\nBut that I may be the more capable to assist in lifting up a standard\r\nagainst the infernal enemy, I must renew my most importunate request,\r\nthat you would please quickly to perform what you kindly promised, of\r\ngiving me a narrative of the evidences given in at the trials of half a\r\ndozen, or if you please a dozen, of the principal witches that have\r\nbeen condemned. I know 'twill cost you some time; but, when you are\r\nsensible of the benefit that will follow, I know you will not think\r\nmuch of that cost; and my own willingness to expose myself unto the\r\nutmost for the defence of my friends with you makes me presume to plead\r\nsomething of merit to be considered.\r\n\r\nI shall be content, if you draw up the desired narrative by way of\r\nletter to me; or, at least, let it not come without a letter, wherein\r\nyou shall, if you can, intimate over again what you have sometimes told\r\nme of the awe which is upon the hearts of your juries, with ... unto\r\nthe validity of the spectral evidences.\r\n\r\nPlease also to ... some of your observations about the confessors and\r\nthe credibility of what they assert, or about things evidently\r\npreternatural in the witchcrafts, and whatever else you may account an\r\nentertainment, for an inquisitive person, that entirely loves you and\r\n_Salem_. Nay, though I will never lay aside the character which I\r\nmentioned in my last words, yet I am willing, that, when you write, you\r\nshould imagine me as obstinate a Sadducee and witch-advocate as any\r\namong us: address me as one that believed nothing reasonable; and when\r\nyou have so knocked me down, in a spectre so unlike me, you will enable\r\nme to box it about among my neighbors, till it come—I know not where at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nBut assure yourself, as I shall not wittingly make what you write\r\nprejudicial to any worthy design which those two excellent persons, Mr.\r\nHale and Mr. Noyse, may have in hand; so you shall find that I shall\r\nbe, sir, your grateful friend,\r\n\r\nC. Mather.\r\n\r\nP.S.—That which very much strengthens the charms of the request which\r\nthis letter makes you is, that His Excellency the Governor laid his\r\npositive commands upon me to desire this favor of you; and the truth\r\nis, there are some of his circumstances with reference to this affair,\r\nwhich I need not mention, that call for the expediting of your\r\nkindness,—_kindness_, I say, for such it will be esteemed as well by\r\nhim as by your servant,\r\n\r\nC. Mather.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the character and aim of this letter, it will be\r\nnecessary to consider its date. It was written Sept. 20, 1692. On the\r\n19th of August, but one month before, Dr. Mather[ii.489] was acting a\r\nconspicuous part under the gallows at Witch-hill, at the execution of\r\nMr. Burroughs and four others, increasing the power of the awful\r\ndelusion, and inflaming the passions of the people. On the 9th of\r\nSeptember, six more miserable creatures received sentence of death. On\r\nthe 17th of September, nine more received sentence of death. On the\r\n19th of September, Giles Corey was crushed to death. And, on the 22d of\r\nSeptember, eight were executed. These were the last that suffered\r\ndeath. The letter, therefore, was written while the horrors of the\r\ntransaction were at their height, and by a person who had himself been\r\na witness of them, and whose \"good hap\" it had been to \"do some little\r\nservice\" in promoting them. The object of the writer is declared to be,\r\nthat he might be \"more capable to assist in lifting up a standard\r\nagainst the infernal enemy.\" The literal meaning of this expression is,\r\nthat he might be enabled to get up another witchcraft delusion under\r\nhis own special management and control. Can any thing be imagined more\r\nartful and dishonest than the plan he had contrived to keep himself out\r\nof sight in all the operations necessary to accomplish his purpose?\r\n\"Nay, though I will never lay aside the character which I mentioned in\r\nmy last words, yet I am willing, that, when you write, you should\r\nimagine me as obstinate a Sadducee and witch-advocate as any among us:\r\naddress me as one that believed nothing reasonable; and when you have\r\nso knocked me down, in a spectre so unlike me, you will enable me to\r\nbox it about among my neighbors, till it come—I know not where at\r\nlast.\"\r\n\r\nUpon obtaining the document requisite to the fulfilment of his design,\r\nhe did \"box it about\" so effectually among his neighbors, that he\r\nsucceeded that next summer in getting up a wonderful case of\r\nwitchcraft, in the person of one Margaret Rule, a member of his\r\ncongregation in Boston. Dr. Mather published an account of her\r\nlong-continued fastings, even unto the ninth day, and of the incredible\r\nsufferings she endured from the \"infernal enemy.\" \"She was thrown,\"\r\nsays he, \"into such exorbitant convulsions as were astonishing to the\r\nspectators in general. They that could behold the doleful condition of\r\nthe poor family without sensible compassions might have entrails,\r\nindeed, but I am sure they could have no true bowels in them.\" So far\r\nwas he successful in spreading the delusion, that he prevailed upon six\r\nmen to testify[ii.490] that they had seen Margaret Rule lifted bodily\r\nfrom her bed, and raised by an invisible power \"so as to touch the\r\ngarret floor;\" that she was entirely removed from the bed or any other\r\nmaterial support; that she continued suspended for several minutes; and\r\nthat a strong man, assisted by several other persons, could not\r\neffectually resist the mysterious force that lifted her up, and poised\r\nher aloft in the air! The people of Boston were saved from the horrors\r\nintended to be brought upon them by this dark and deep-laid plot, by\r\nthe activity, courage, and discernment of Calef and others, who\r\ndistrusted Dr. Mather, and, by watching his movements, exposed the\r\nimposture, and overthrew the whole design.\r\n\r\nMr. Parris does not appear to have produced much effect by his sermons.\r\nThe people had suffered enough from the \"war between the Devil and the\r\nLamb,\" as he and Mather had conducted it; and it could not be renewed.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the termination of the witchcraft proceedings, the\r\ncontroversy between Mr. Parris and the congregation, or the\r\ninhabitants, as they were called, of the village, was renewed, with\r\nearnest resolution on their part to get rid of him. The parish\r\nneglected and refused to raise the means for paying his salary; and a\r\nmajority of the voters, in the meetings of the \"inhabitants,\"\r\nvigilantly resisted all attempts in his favor. The church was still\r\ncompletely under his influence; and, as has been stated in the First\r\nPart, he made use of that body to institute a suit against the people.\r\nThe court and magistrates were wholly in his favor, and peremptorily\r\nordered the appointment, by the people, of a new committee. The\r\ninhabitants complied with the order by the election of a new committee,\r\nbut took care to have it composed exclusively of men opposed to Mr.\r\nParris; and he found himself no better off than before. He concluded\r\nnot to employ his church any longer as a principal agent in his lawsuit\r\nagainst the parish; but used it for another purpose.\r\n\r\nAfter the explosion of the witchcraft delusion, the relations of\r\nparties became entirely changed. The prosecutors at the trials were put\r\non the defensive, and felt themselves in peril. Parris saw his danger,\r\nand, with characteristic courage and fertility of resources, prepared\r\nto defend himself, and carry the war upon any quarter from which an\r\nattack might be apprehended. He[ii.491] continued, on his own\r\nresponsibility, to prosecute, in court, his suit against the parish,\r\nand in his usual trenchant style. As the law then was, a minister, in a\r\ncontroversy with his parish, had a secure advantage, and absolutely\r\ncommanded the situation, if his church were with him. From the time of\r\nhis settlement, Parris had shaped his policy on this basis. He had\r\nsought to make his church an impregnable fortress against his\r\nopponents. But, to be impregnable, it was necessary that there should\r\nbe no enemies within it. A few disaffected brethren could at any time\r\ndemand, and have a claim to, a mutual council; and Mr. Parris knew,\r\nthat, before the investigations of such a council, his actions in the\r\nwitchcraft prosecutions could not stand. This perhaps suggested his\r\nmovements, in August, 1692, against Samuel Nurse, John Tarbell, and\r\nPeter Cloyse. He did not at that time succeed in getting rid of them;\r\nand they remained in the church, and, with the exception of Cloyse, in\r\nthe village. They might at any time take the steps that would lead to a\r\nmutual council; and Mr. Parris was determined, at all events, to\r\nprevent that. It was evident that the members of that family would\r\ninsist upon satisfaction being given them, in and through the church,\r\nfor the wrongs he had done them. Although, in the absence of Cloyse,\r\nbut two in number, there was danger that sympathy for them might reach\r\nothers of the brethren. Thomas Wilkins, a member in good standing, son\r\nof old Bray Wilkins, and a connection of John Willard, an intelligent\r\nand resolute man, had already joined them. Parris felt that others\r\nmight follow, and that whatever could be done to counteract them must\r\nbe done quickly. He accordingly initiated proceedings in his church to\r\nrid himself of them, if not by excommunication, at least by getting\r\nthem under discipline, so as to prevent the possibility of their\r\ndealing with him.\r\n\r\nThis led to one of the most remarkable passages of the kind in the\r\nannals of the New-England churches. It is narrated in detail by Mr.\r\nParris, in his church record-book. It would not be easy to find\r\nanywhere an example of greater skill, wariness, or ability in a\r\nconflict of this sort. On the one side is Mr. Parris, backed by his\r\nchurch and the magistrates, and aided, it is probable, by Mr. Noyes; on\r\nthe other, three husbandmen. They had no known backers or advisers;\r\nand, at frequent stages of the fencing match, had to parry or strike,\r\nwithout time to consult any[ii.492] one. Mr. Parris was ingenious,\r\nquick, a great strategist, and not over-scrupulous as to the use of his\r\nweapons. Nurse, Tarbell, and Wilkins were cautious, cool, steady, and\r\npersistent. Of course, they were wholly inexperienced in such things,\r\nand liable to make wrong moves, or to be driven or drawn to untenable\r\nground. But they will not be found, I think, to have taken a false step\r\nfrom beginning to end. Their line of action was extremely narrow. It\r\nwas necessary to avoid all personalities, and every appearance of\r\npassion or excitement; to make no charge against Mr. Parris that could\r\ntouch the church, as such, or reflect upon the courts, magistrates, or\r\nany others that had taken part in the prosecutions. It was necessary to\r\navoid putting any thing into writing, with their names attached, which\r\ncould in any way be tortured into a libel. Parris lets fall expressions\r\nwhich show that he was on the watch for something of the kind to seize\r\nupon, to transfer the movement from the church to the courts. Entirely\r\nunaccustomed to public speaking, these three farmers had to meet\r\nassemblages composed of their opponents, and much wrought up against\r\nthem; to make statements, and respond to interrogatories and\r\npropositions, the full and ultimate bearing of which was not always\r\napparent: any unguarded expression might be fatal to their cause. Their\r\nsafety depended upon using the right word at the right time and in the\r\nright manner, and in withholding the statement of their grievances, in\r\nadequate force of language, until they were under the shelter of a\r\ncouncil. If, during the long-protracted conferences and communications,\r\nthey had tripped at any point, allowed a phrase or syllable to escape\r\nwhich might be made the ground of discipline or censure, all would be\r\nlost; for Parris could not be reached but through a council, and a\r\ncouncil could not even be asked for except by brethren in full and\r\nclear standing. It was often attempted to ensnare them into making\r\ncharges against the church; but they kept their eye on Parris, and, as\r\nthey told him more than once in the presence of the whole body of the\r\npeople, on him alone. Limited as the ground was on which they could\r\nstand, they held it steadfastly, and finally drove him from his\r\nstronghold.\r\n\r\nOn the first movement of Mr. Parris offensively upon them, they\r\ncommenced their movement upon him. The method by which alone they could\r\nproceed, according to ecclesiastical law[ii.493] and the platform of\r\nthe churches, was precisely as it was understood to be laid down in\r\nMatt. xviii. 15-17. Following these directions, Samuel Nurse first\r\ncalled alone upon Mr. Parris, and privately made known his grievances.\r\nParris gave him no satisfaction. Then, after a due interval, Nurse,\r\nTarbell, and Wilkins called upon him together. He refused to see them\r\ntogether, but one at a time was allowed to go up into his study.\r\nTarbell and Nurse each spent an hour or more with him, leaving no time\r\nfor Wilkins. In these interviews, he not only failed to give\r\nsatisfaction, but, according to his own account, treated them in the\r\ncoolest and most unfeeling manner, not allowing himself to utter a\r\nsoothing word, but actually reiterating his belief of the guilt of\r\ntheir mother; telling them, as he says, \"that he had not seen\r\nsufficient grounds to vary his opinion.\" Cloyse came soon after to the\r\nvillage, and had an interview with him for the same purpose. Parris saw\r\nthem one only at a time, in order to preclude their taking the second\r\nstep required by the gospel rule; that is, to have a brother of the\r\nchurch with them as a witness. He also took the ground that they could\r\nnot be witnesses for each other, but that he should treat them all as\r\nonly one person in the transaction. A sense of the injustice of his\r\nconduct, or some other consideration, led William Way, another of the\r\nbrethren, to go with them as a witness. Nurse, Tarbell, Wilkins,\r\nCloyse, and Way went to his house together. He said that the four first\r\nwere but one person in the case; but admitted that Way was a distinct\r\nperson, a brother of accredited standing, and a witness. He escaped,\r\nhowever, under the subterfuge that the gospel rule required \"two or\r\n_three_ witnesses.\" In this way, the matter stood for some time; Parris\r\nsaying that they had not complied with the conditions in Matt. xviii.,\r\nand they maintaining that they had.\r\n\r\nThe course of Parris was fast diminishing his hold upon the public\r\nconfidence. It was plain that the disaffected brethren had done what\r\nthey could, in an orderly way, to procure a council. At length, the\r\nleading clergymen here and in Boston, whose minds were open to reason,\r\nthought it their duty to interpose their advice. They wrote to Parris,\r\nthat he and his church ought to consent to a council. They wrote a\r\nsecond time in stronger terms. Not daring to quarrel with so large a\r\nportion of the clergy, Parris pretended to comply with their advice,\r\nbut demanded a majority of the coun[ii.494]cil to be chosen by him and\r\nhis church. The disaffected brethren insisted upon a fair, mutual\r\ncouncil; each party to have three ministers, with their delegates, in\r\nit. To this, Parris had finally to agree. The dissatisfied brethren\r\nnamed, as one of their three, a church at Ipswich. Parris objected to\r\nthe Ipswich church. The dissenting brethren insisted that each side\r\nshould be free to select its respective three churches. Parris was not\r\nwilling to have Ipswich in the council. The other party insisted, and\r\nhere the matter hung suspended. The truth is, that the disaffected\r\nbrethren were resolved to have the Rev. John Wise in the council. They\r\nknew Cotton Mather would be there, on the side of Parris; and they knew\r\nthat John Wise was the man to meet him. The public opinion settled down\r\nin favor of the dissatisfied brethren, on the ground that each party to\r\na mutual council ought to—and, to make it really mutual, must—have free\r\nand full power to nominate the churches to be called by it. Parris,\r\nbeing afraid to have a mutual council, and particularly if Mr. Wise was\r\nin it, suddenly took a new position. He and his church called an _ex\r\nparte_ council, at which the following ministers, with their delegates,\r\nwere present: Samuel Checkley of the New South Church, James Allen of\r\nthe First Church, Samuel Willard of the Old South, Increase and Cotton\r\nMather of the North Church,—all of Boston; Samuel Torrey of Weymouth;\r\nSamuel Phillips of Rowley, and Edward Payson, also of Rowley. Among the\r\ndelegates were many of the leading public men of the province. The\r\nresult was essentially damaging to Mr. Parris. The tide was now\r\nstrongly set against him. The Boston ministers advised him to withdraw\r\nfrom the contest. They provided a settlement for him in Connecticut,\r\nand urged him to quit the village, and go there. But he refused, and\r\nprolonged the struggle. In the course of it, papers were drawn up and\r\nsigned, one by his friends, another by his opponents, together\r\nembracing nearly all the men and women of the village. Those who did\r\nnot sign either paper were understood to sympathize with the\r\ndisaffected brethren. Many who signed the paper favorable to him acted\r\nundoubtedly from the motive stated in the heading; viz., that the\r\nremoval of Mr. Parris could do no good, \"for we have had three\r\nministers removed already, and by every removal our differences have\r\nbeen rather aggravated.\" Another removal, they thought, would utterly\r\nruin them. They[ii.495] do not express any particular interest in Mr.\r\nParris, but merely dread another change. They preferred to bear the\r\nills they had, rather than fly to others that they knew not of. It is a\r\nvery significant fact, that neither Mrs. Ann Putnam nor the widow Sarah\r\nHoulton signed either paper (the Sarah Houlton whose name appears was\r\nthe wife of Joseph Houlton, Sr.). There is reason to believe that they\r\nregretted the part they had taken, particularly against Rebecca Nurse,\r\nand probably did not feel over favorably to the person who had led them\r\ninto their dreadful responsibility.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the controversy continued to wax warm among the\r\npeople. Mr. Parris was determined to hold his place, and, with it, the\r\nparsonage and ministry lands. The opposition was active, unappeasable,\r\nand effective. The following paper, handed about, illustrates the\r\nmethods by which they assailed him:—\r\n\r\n\"As to the contest between Mr. Parris and his hearers, &c., it may be\r\ncomposed by a satisfactory answer to Lev. xx. 6: 'And the soul that\r\nturneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go\r\na-whoring after them, I will set my face against that soul, and will\r\ncut him off from among his people.' 1 Chron. x. 13, 14: 'So Saul died\r\nfor his transgression which he committed against the Lord,—even against\r\nthe word of the Lord, which he kept not,—and also for asking counsel of\r\none who had a familiar to inquire of it, and inquired not of the Lord:\r\ntherefore he slew him,'\" &c.\r\n\r\nMr. Parris mirrored, or rather daguerrotyped, his inmost thoughts upon\r\nthe page of his church record-book. Whatever feeling happened to\r\nexercise his spirit, found expression there. This gives it a truly rare\r\nand singular interest. Among a variety of scraps variegating the\r\nrecord, and thrown in with other notices of deaths, he has the\r\nfollowing:—\r\n\r\n\"1694, Oct. 27.—Ruth, daughter to Job Swinnerton (died), and buried the\r\n28th instant, being the Lord's Day; and the corpse carried by the\r\nmeeting-house door in time of singing before meeting afternoon, and\r\nmore at the funeral than at the sermon.\"\r\n\r\nThis illustrates the state of things. The Swinnerton family were all\r\nalong opposed to Mr. Parris, and kept remarkably clear from the\r\nwitchcraft delusion. Originally, it was not customary to have prayers\r\nat funerals. At any rate, all that Mr. Parris had to do on the occasion\r\nwas to witness and record the fact, which he[ii.496] indites in the\r\npithy manner in which he often relieves his mind, that more people went\r\nto the distant burial-ground than came to hear him preach. The\r\nprocession was made up of his opponents; the congregation, of his\r\nfriends. At last, Captain John Putnam proposed that each party should\r\nchoose an equal number from themselves to decide the controversy; and\r\nthat Major Bartholomew Gedney, from the town, should be invited to act\r\nas moderator of the joint meeting. Both sides agreed, and appointed\r\ntheir representatives. Major Gedney consented to preside. But this\r\nmovement came to nothing, probably owing to the refractoriness of Mr.\r\nParris; for, from that moment, he had no supporters. The church ceased\r\nto act: its members were merged in the meeting of the inhabitants.\r\nThere was no longer any division among them. The party that had acted\r\nas friends of Mr. Parris united thenceforward with his opponents to\r\ndefend the parish in the suit he had brought against it in the courts.\r\nThe controversy was quite protracted. The Court was determined to\r\nuphold him, and expressed its prejudice against the parish, sometimes\r\nwith considerable severity of manner and action.[L]\r\n[ii.497]\r\nThe parish heeded not the frowns of the Court, but persisted inexorably\r\nin its purpose to get rid of Mr. Parris. After an obstinate contest, it\r\nprevailed. In the last stage of the controversy, it appointed four men,\r\nas its agents or attorneys, whose names indicate the spirit in which it\r\nacted,—John Tarbell, Samuel Nurse, Daniel Andrew, and Joseph Putnam.\r\nHis dauntless son did not follow the wolf through the deep and dark\r\nrecesses of his den with a more determined resolution than that with\r\nwhich Joseph Putnam pursued Samuel Parris through the windings of the\r\nlaw, until he ferreted him out, and rid the village of him for ever.\r\n\r\nFinally, the inferior court of Common Pleas, before which Mr. Parris\r\nhad carried the case, ordered that the matters in controversy between\r\nhim and the inhabitants of Salem Village should be referred to\r\narbitrators for decision. The following statement was laid before them\r\nby the persons representing the inhabitants:—\r\n\r\n_\"To the Honorable Wait Winthrop, Elisha Cook, and Samuel Sewall,\r\nEsquires, Arbitrators, indifferently chosen, between Mr. Samuel Parris\r\nand the Inhabitants of Salem Village._\r\n\r\n_\"The Remonstrances of several Aggrieved Persons in the said Village,\r\nwith further Reasons why they conceive they ought not to hear Mr.\r\nParris, nor to own him as a Minister of the Gospel, nor to contribute\r\nany Support to him as such for several years past, humbly offered as\r\nfit for consideration._\r\n\r\n\"We humbly conceive that, having, in April, 1693, given our reasons why\r\nwe could not join with Mr. Parris in prayer, preaching, or sacrament,\r\nif these reasons are found sufficient for our withdrawing (and we\r\ncannot yet find but they are), then we conceive ourselves virtually\r\ndischarged, not only in conscience, but also in law, which\r\nre[ii.498]quires maintenance to be given to such as are orthodox and\r\nblameless; the said Mr. Parris having been teaching such dangerous\r\nerrors, and preached such scandalous immoralities, as ought to\r\ndischarge any (though ever so gifted otherways) from the work of the\r\nministry, particularly in his oath against the lives of several,\r\nwherein he swears that the prisoners with their looks knock down those\r\npretended sufferers. We humbly conceive that he that swears to more\r\nthan he is certain of, is equally guilty of perjury with him that\r\nswears to what is false. And though they did fall at such a time, yet\r\nit could not be known that they did it, much less could they be certain\r\nof it; yet did swear positively against the lives of such as he could\r\nnot have any knowledge but they might be innocent.\r\n\r\n\"His believing the Devil's accusations, and readily departing from all\r\ncharity to persons, though of blameless and godly lives, upon such\r\nsuggestions; his promoting such accusations; as also his partiality\r\ntherein in stifling the accusations of some, and, at the same time,\r\nvigilantly promoting others,—as we conceive, are just causes for our\r\nrefusal, &c.\r\n\r\n\"That Mr. Parris's going to Mary Walcot or Abigail Williams, and\r\ndirecting others to them, to know who afflicted the people in their\r\nillnesses,—we understand this to be a dealing with them that have a\r\nfamiliar spirit, and an implicit denying the providence of God, who\r\nalone, as we believe, can send afflictions, or cause devils to afflict\r\nany: this we also conceive sufficient to justify such refusal.\r\n\r\n\"That Mr. Parris, by these practices and principles, has been the\r\nbeginner and procurer of the sorest afflictions, not to this village\r\nonly, but to this whole country, that did ever befall them.\r\n\r\n\"We, the subscribers, in behalf of ourselves, and of several others of\r\nthe same mind with us (touching these things), having some of us had\r\nour relations by these practices taken off by an untimely death; others\r\nhave been imprisoned and suffered in our persons, reputations, and\r\nestates,—submit the whole to your honors' decision, to determine\r\nwhether we are or ought to be any ways obliged to honor, respect, and\r\nsupport such an instrument of our miseries; praying God to guide your\r\nhonors to act herein as may be for his glory, and the future settlement\r\nof our village in amity and unity.\r\n\r\n\"John Tarbell,\r\nSamuel Nurse,\r\nJoseph Putnam,\r\nDaniel Andrew,\r\n\r\n_Attorneys for the people of the Village_.\r\n\r\nBoston, July 21, 1697.\" [ii.499]\r\n\r\nThe arbitrators decided that the inhabitants should pay to Mr. Parris a\r\ncertain amount for arrearages, and also the sum of £79. 9_s._ 6_d._ for\r\nall his right and interest in the ministry house and land, and that he\r\nbe forthwith dismissed; and his ministerial relation to the church and\r\nsociety in Salem Village dissolved. The parish raised the money with\r\ngreat alacrity. Nathaniel Ingersoll, who had, as has been stated, made\r\nhim a present at his settlement of a valuable piece of land adjoining\r\nthe parsonage grounds, bought it back, paying him a liberal price for\r\nit, fully equal to its value; and he left the place, so far as appears,\r\nfor ever.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of July, 1696, in the midst of his controversy with his\r\npeople, his wife died. She was an excellent woman; and was respected\r\nand lamented by all. He caused a stone slab to be placed at the head of\r\nher grave, with a suitable inscription, still plainly legible,\r\nconcluding with four lines, to which his initials are appended,\r\ncomposed by him, of which this is one: \"Farewell, best wife, choice\r\nmother, neighbor, friend.\" Her ashes rest in what is called the\r\nWadsworth burial ground.\r\n\r\nMr. Parris removed to Newton, then to Concord; and in November, 1697,\r\nbegan to preach at Stow, on a salary of forty pounds, half in money and\r\nhalf in provisions, &c. A grant from the general court was relied upon\r\nfrom year to year to help to make up the twenty pounds to be paid in\r\nmoney. Afterwards he preached at Dunstable, partly supported by a grant\r\nfrom the general court, and finally in Sudbury, where he died, Feb. 27,\r\n1720. His daughter Elizabeth, who belonged, it will be remembered, to\r\nthe circle of \"afflicted children\" in 1692, then nine years of age, in\r\n1710 married Benjamin Barnes of Concord. Two other daughters married in\r\nSudbury. His son Noyes, who graduated at Harvard College in 1721,\r\nbecame deranged, and was supported by the town. His other son Samuel\r\nwas long deacon of the church at Sudbury, and died Nov. 22, 1792, aged\r\nninety-one years.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Boston News Letter,\" No. 1433, July 15, 1731, is a notice, as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n\"Any person or persons who knew Mr. Samuel Parris, formerly of\r\nBarbadoes, afterwards of Boston in New England, merchant, and after\r\nthat minister of Salem Village, &c., deceased to be a son of Thomas\r\nParris of the island aforesaid, Esq. who deceased 1673, or[ii.500] sole\r\nheir by will to all his estate in said island, are desired to give or\r\nsend notice thereof to the printer of this paper; and it shall be for\r\ntheir advantage.\"\r\n\r\nWhether the identity of Mr. Parris, of Salem Village, with the son of\r\nThomas Parris, of Barbadoes, was established, we have no information.\r\nIf it was, some relief may have come to his descendants. There is every\r\nreason to believe, that, after leaving the village, he and his family\r\nsuffered from extremely limited means, if not from absolute poverty.\r\nThe general ill-repute brought upon him by his conduct in the\r\nwitchcraft prosecutions followed him to the last. He had forfeited the\r\nsympathy of his clerical brethren by his obstinate refusal to take\r\ntheir advice. They earnestly, over and over again, expostulated against\r\nhis prolonging the controversy with the people of Salem Village,\r\nbesought him to relinquish it, and promised him, if he would, to\r\nprovide an eligible settlement elsewhere. They actually did provide\r\none. But he rejected their counsels and persuasions, in expressions of\r\nill-concealed bitterness. So that, when he was finally driven away,\r\nthey felt under no obligations to befriend him; and with his eminent\r\nabilities he eked out a precarious and inadequate maintenance for\r\nhimself and family, in feeble settlements in outskirt towns, during the\r\nrest of his days.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to describe the character of this unfortunate man. Just\r\nas is the condemnation which facts compel history to pronounce, I have\r\na feeling of relief in the thought, that, before the tribunal to which\r\nhe so long ago passed, the mercy we all shall need, which comprehends\r\nall motives and allows for all infirmities, has been extended to him,\r\nin its infinite wisdom and benignity.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of uncommon abilities, of extraordinary vivacity and\r\nactivity of intellect. He does not appear to have been wilfully\r\nmalevolent; although somewhat reckless in a contest, he was not\r\ndeliberately untruthful; on the contrary, there is in his statements a\r\nsingular ingenuousness and fairness, seldom to be found in a partisan,\r\nmuch more seldom in a principal. Although we get almost all we know of\r\nthe examinations of accused parties in the witchcraft proceedings, and\r\nof his long contentions with his parish, from him, there is hardly any\r\nground to regret that the parties on the other side had no friends to\r\ntell their story. A transparency[ii.501] of character, a sort of\r\ninstinctive incontinency of mind, which made him let out every thing,\r\nor a sort of blindness which prevented his seeing the bearings of what\r\nwas said and done, make his reports the vehicles of the materials for\r\nthe defence of the very persons he was prosecuting. I know of no\r\ninstance like it. His style is lucid, graphic, lively, natural to the\r\nhighest degree; and whatever he describes, we see the whole, and, as it\r\nwere, from all points of view. Language flowed from his pen with a\r\nfacility, simplicity, expressiveness, and accuracy, not surpassed or\r\noften equalled. He wrote as men talk, using colloquial expressions\r\nwithout reserve, but always to the point. When we read, we hear him;\r\nabbreviating names, and clipping words, as in the most familiar and\r\nunguarded conversation. He was not hampered by fear of offending the\r\nrules which some think necessary to dignify composition. In his\r\noff-hand, free and easy, gossiping entries in the church-book, or in\r\nhis carefully prepared productions, like the \"Meditations for Peace,\"\r\nread before his church and the dissatisfied brethren, we have specimens\r\nof plain good English, in its most translucent and effective forms.\r\nConsidering that his academic education was early broken off, and many\r\nintermediate years were spent in commercial pursuits, his learning and\r\nattainments are quite remarkable. The various troubles and tragic\r\nmischiefs of his life, the terrible wrongs he inflicted on others, and\r\nthe retributions he brought upon himself, are traceable to two or three\r\npeculiarities in his mental and moral organization.\r\n\r\nHe had a passion for a scene, a ceremony, an excitement. He delighted\r\nin the exercise of power, and rejoiced in conflicts or commotions, from\r\nthe exhilaration they occasioned, and the opportunity they gave for the\r\ngratification of the activity of his nature. He pursued the object of\r\ngetting possession of the ministry house and land with such desperate\r\npertinacity, not, I think, from avaricious motives, but for the sake of\r\nthe power it would give him as a considerable landholder. His love of\r\nform and public excitement led him to operate as he did with his\r\nchurch. He kept it in continual action during the few years of his\r\nministry. He had at least seventy-five special meetings of that body,\r\nwithout counting those which probably occurred without number, but of\r\nwhich there is no record, during the six months of the witchcraft\r\nperiod. Twice, the brethren gave out, wholly exhausted; and the\r\npowers[ii.502] of the church were, by vote, transferred to a special\r\ncommittee, to act in its behalf, composed of persons who had time and\r\nstrength to spare. But Mr. Parris, never weary of excitement, would\r\nhave been delighted to preside over church-meetings, and to be a\r\nparticipator in vehement proceedings, every day of his life. The more\r\nnoisy and heated the contention, the more he enjoyed it. During all the\r\ntransactions connected with the witchcraft prosecutions, he was\r\neverywhere present, always wide awake, full of animation, if not\r\ncheerfulness, and ready to take any part to carry them on. These\r\npropensities and dispositions were fraught with danger, and prolific of\r\nevil in his case, in consequence of what looks very much like a total\r\nwant in himself of many of the natural human sensibilities, and an\r\ninability to apprehend them in others. Through all the horrors of the\r\nwitchcraft prosecutions, he never evinced the slightest sensibility,\r\nand never seemed to be aware that anybody else had any. It was not\r\nabsolute cruelty, but the absence of what may be regarded as a natural\r\nsense. It was not a positive wickedness, but a negative defect. He\r\nseemed to be surprised that other people had sentiments, and could not\r\nunderstand why Tarbell and Nurse felt so badly about the execution of\r\ntheir mother. He told them to their faces, without dreaming of giving\r\nthem offence, that, while they thought she was innocent, and he thought\r\nshe was guilty and had been justly put to death, it was a mere\r\ndifference of opinion, as about an indifferent matter. In his\r\n\"Meditations for Peace,\" presented to these dissatisfied brethren, for\r\nthe purpose and with an earnest desire of appeasing them, he tells them\r\nthat the indulgence of such feelings at all is a yielding to\r\n\"temptation,\" being under \"the clouds of human weakness,\" and \"a\r\nbewraying of remaining corruption.\" Indeed, the theology of that day,\r\nit must be allowed, bore very hard upon even the best and most sacred\r\naffections of our nature. The council, in their Result, allude to the\r\nfeelings of those whose parents, and other most loved and honored\r\nrelatives and connections, had been so cruelly torn from them and put\r\nto death, as \"infirmities discovered by them in such an heart-breaking\r\nday,\" and bespeak for their grief and lamentations a charitable\r\nconstruction. They ask the church, whose hands were red with the blood\r\nof their innocent and dearest friends, not to pursue them with \"more\r\ncritical and vigorous proceedings\" in consequence of their exhibiting\r\nthese[ii.503] natural sensibilities on the occasion, but \"to treat them\r\nwith bowels of much compassion.\" These views had taken full effect upon\r\nMr. Parris, and obliterated from his breast all such \"infirmities.\"\r\nThis is the only explanation or apology that can be made for him.\r\n\r\nOf the history of Cotton Mather, subsequently to the witchcraft\r\nprosecutions, and more or less in consequence of his agency in them, it\r\nmay be said that the residue of his life was doomed to disappointment,\r\nand imbittered by reproach and defeat. The storm of fanatical delusion,\r\nwhich he doubted not would carry him to the heights of clerical and\r\nspiritual power, in America and everywhere, had left him a wreck. His\r\npolitical aspirations, always one of his strongest passions, were\r\nwholly blasted; and the great aim and crown of his ambition, the\r\nPresidency of Harvard College, once and again and for ever had eluded\r\nhis grasp. I leave him to tell his story, and reveal the state of his\r\nmind and heart in his own most free and full expressions from his\r\nprivate diary for the year 1724.\r\n\r\n\"1. What has a gracious Lord helped me to do for the _seafaring tribe_,\r\nin prayers for them, in sermons to them, in books bestowed upon them,\r\nand in various projections and endeavors to render the sailors a happy\r\ngeneration?

What has a gracious Lord given me to do in a variety of[ii.505]\r\n_services_? For many lustres of years, not a day has passed me, without\r\nsome devices, even written devices, to be serviceable. And yet my\r\nsufferings! They seem to be (as in reason they should be) more than my\r\nservices. Everybody points at me, and speaks of me as by far the most\r\nafflicted minister in all New England. And many look on me as the\r\ngreatest sinner, because the greatest sufferer; and are pretty\r\narbitrary in their conjectures upon my punished miscarriages.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Diary, May 7, 1724._—The sudden death of the unhappy man who\r\nsustained the place of President in our College will open a door for my\r\ndoing singular services in the best of interests. I do not know that\r\nthe care of the College will now be cast upon me, though I am told that\r\nit is what is most generally wished for. If it should be, I shall be in\r\nabundance of distress about it; but, if it should not, yet I may do\r\nmany things for the good of the College more quietly and more hopefully\r\nthan formerly.\r\n\r\n\"_June 5._—The College is in great hazard of dissipation and grievous\r\ndestruction and confusion. My advice to some that have some influence\r\non the public may be seasonable.\r\n\r\n\"_July 1, 1724._—This day being our _insipid, ill-contrived\r\nanniversary_, which we call the _Commencement_, I chose to spend it at\r\nhome in supplications, partly on the behalf of the College that it may\r\nnot be foolishly thrown away, but that God may bestow such a President\r\nupon it as may prove a rich blessing unto it and unto all our\r\nchurches.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of November, 1724, the corporation of Harvard College\r\nelected the Rev. Benjamin Colman, pastor of the Brattle-street Church\r\nin Boston, to the vacant presidential chair. He declined the\r\nappointment. The question hung in suspense another six months. In June,\r\n1725, the Rev. Benjamin Wadsworth, pastor of the First Church in\r\nBoston, was elected, accepted the office, and held it to his death, on\r\nthe 16th of March, 1737. It may easily be imagined how keenly these\r\nrepeated slights were felt by Cotton Mather. He died on the 13th of\r\nFebruary, 1728.\r\n\r\nFrom the early part of the spring of 1695, when the abortive attempt to\r\nsettle the difficulty between Mr. Parris and the people of the village,\r\nby the umpirage of Major Gedney, was made, it evidently became the\r\nsettled purpose of the leading men, on both sides, to restore harmony\r\nto the place. On all committees, persons who had been prominent in\r\nopposition to each other were joined together, that, thus co-operating,\r\nthey might become reconciled.[ii.506] This is strikingly illustrated in\r\nthe \"seating of the meeting-house,\" as it was called. In 1699, in a\r\nseat accommodating three persons, John Putnam the son of Nathaniel, and\r\nJohn Tarbell, were two of the three. Another seat for three was\r\noccupied by James and John Putnam, sons of John, and by Thomas Wilkins.\r\nThomas Putnam and Samuel Nurse were placed in the same seat; and so\r\nwere the wives of Thomas Putnam and Samuel Nurse, and the widow Sarah\r\nHoulton. The widow Preston, daughter of Rebecca Nurse, was seated with\r\nthe widow Walcot, mother of Mary, one of the accusing girls.\r\n\r\nWe see in this the effect of the wise and decisive course adopted by\r\nMr. Parris's successor, the Rev. Joseph Green. Immediately upon his\r\nordination, Nov. 10, 1698, he addressed himself in earnest to the work\r\nof reconciliation in that distracted parish. From the date of its\r\nexistence, nearly thirty years before, it had been torn by constant\r\nstrife. It had just passed through scenes which had brought all hearts\r\ninto the most terrible alienation. A man of less faith would not have\r\nbelieved it possible, that the horrors and outrages of those scenes\r\ncould ever be forgotten, forgiven, or atoned for, by those who had\r\nsuffered or committed the wrongs. But he knew the infinite power of the\r\ndivine love, which, as a minister of Christ, it was his office to\r\ninspire and diffuse. He knew that, with the blessing of God, that\r\npeople, who had from the first been devouring each other, and upon\r\nwhose garments the stain of the blood of brethren and sisters was\r\nfresh, might be made \"kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving\r\none another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven\" them. In this\r\nheroic and Christ-like faith, he entered upon and steadfastly adhered\r\nto his divine work. He pursued it with patience, wisdom, and courageous\r\nenergy. No ministry in the whole history of the New-England churches\r\nhas had a more difficult task put upon it, and none has more perfectly\r\nsucceeded in its labors. I shall describe the administration of this\r\ngood man, as a minister of reconciliation, in his own words,\r\ntranscribed from his church records:—\r\n\r\n\"Nov. 25, 1698, being spent in holy exercises (in order to our\r\npreparation for the sacrament of the Lord's Supper), at John Putnam,\r\nJr.'s, after the exercise, I desired the church to manifest, by the\r\nusual sign, that they were so cordially satisfied with their brethren,\r\nThomas Wilkins, John Tarbell, and Samuel Nurse, that they were\r\nheartily[ii.507] desirous that they would join with us in all\r\nordinances, that so we might all live lovingly together. This they\r\nconsented unto, and none made any objection, but voted it by lifting up\r\ntheir hands. And further, that whatever articles they had drawn up\r\nagainst these brethren formerly, they now looked upon them as nothing,\r\nbut let them fall to the ground, being willing that they should be\r\nburied for ever.\r\n\r\n\"Feb. 5, 1699.—This day, also our brother John Tarbell, and his wife,\r\nand Thomas Wilkins and his wife, and Samuel Nurse's wife, joined with\r\nus in the Lord's Supper; which is a matter of thankfulness, seeing they\r\nhave for a long time been so offended as that they could not\r\ncomfortably join with us.\r\n\r\n\"1702.—In December, the pastor spake to the church, on the sabbath, as\r\nfolloweth: 'Brethren, I find in your church-book a record of Martha\r\nCorey's being excommunicated for witchcraft; and, the generality of the\r\nland being sensible of the errors that prevailed in that day, some of\r\nher friends have moved me several times to propose to the church\r\nwhether it be not our duty to recall that sentence, that so it may not\r\nstand against her to all generations; and I myself being a stranger to\r\nher, and being ignorant of what was alleged against her, I shall now\r\nonly leave it to your consideration, and shall determine the matter by\r\na vote the next convenient opportunity.'\r\n\r\n\"Feb. 14, 1702/3.—The major part of the brethren consented to the\r\nfollowing: 'Whereas this church passed a vote, Sept. 11, 1692, for the\r\nexcommunication of Martha Corey, and that sentence was pronounced\r\nagainst her Sept. 14, by Mr. Samuel Parris, formerly the pastor of this\r\nchurch; she being, before her excommunication, condemned, and\r\nafterwards executed, for supposed witchcraft; and there being a record\r\nof this in our church-book, page 12, we being moved hereunto, do freely\r\nconsent and heartily desire that the same sentence may be revoked, and\r\nthat it may stand no longer against her; for we are, through God's\r\nmercy to us, convinced that we were at that dark day under the power of\r\nthose errors which then prevailed in the land; and we are sensible that\r\nwe had not sufficient grounds to think her guilty of that crime for\r\nwhich she was condemned and executed; and that her excommunication was\r\nnot according to the mind of God, and therefore we desire that this may\r\nbe entered in our church-book, to take off that odium that is cast on\r\nher name, and that so God may forgive our sin, and may be atoned for\r\nthe land; and we humbly pray that God will not leave us any more to\r\nsuch errors and sins, but will teach and enable us always to do that\r\nwhich is right in his sight.'\r\n\r\n\"There was a major part voted, and six or seven dissented.\r\n\r\n\"J. Gr., _Pr._\" [ii.508]\r\n\r\nThe First Church in Salem rescinded its votes of excommunication of\r\nRebecca Nurse and Giles Corey, in March, 1712. The church at the\r\nvillage was nearly ten years before it, in this act of justice to\r\nitself and to the memory of the injured dead. Mr. Green did not wait\r\nuntil the public sentiment drove him to it. He regarded it as his duty\r\nto lead, and keep in front of that sentiment, in the right direction.\r\nHe did not wait until everybody demanded it to be done, but instantly\r\nbegan to prepare his people for it. At the proper time, he gave notice\r\nthat he was about to bring the question before them; and he accordingly\r\ndid so. He had no idea of allowing a few narrow-minded, obstinate\r\nindividuals to keep the blot any longer upon the records of his church.\r\nHis conduct is honorable to his name, and to the name of the village.\r\nBy wise, prudent, but persistent efforts, he gradually repaired every\r\nbreach, brought his parish out from under reproach, and set them right\r\nwith each other, with the obligations of justice, and with the spirit\r\nof Christianity. It is affecting to read his ejaculations of praise and\r\ngratitude to God for every symptom of the prevalence of harmony and\r\nlove among the people of his charge.\r\n\r\nThe man who extinguished the fires of passion in a community that had\r\never before been consumed by them deserves to be held in lasting honor.\r\nThe history of the witchcraft delusion in Salem Village would, indeed,\r\nbe imperfectly written, if it failed to present the character of him\r\nwho healed its wounds, obliterated the traces of its malign influence\r\non the hearts and lives of those who acted, and repaired the wrongs\r\ndone to the memory of those who suffered, in it. Joseph Green had a\r\nmanly and amiable nature. He was a studious scholar and an able\r\npreacher. He was devoted to his ministry and faithful to its\r\nobligations. He was a leader of his people, and shared in their\r\noccupations and experiences. He was active in the ordinary employments\r\nof life and daily concerns of society. Possessed of independent\r\nproperty, he was frugal and simple in his habits, and liberal in the\r\nuse of his means. The parsonage, while he lived in it, was the abode of\r\nhospitality, and frequented by the best society in the neighborhood. By\r\nmingled firmness and kindliness, he met and removed difficulties. He\r\nhad a cheerful temperament, was not irritated by the course of events,\r\neven when of an unpleasant character. While Mr. Noyes was disturbed,\r\neven to resentment, by encroachments upon his parish,[ii.509] in the\r\nformation of new societies in the middle precinct of Salem, now South\r\nDanvers, and in the second precinct of Beverly, now Upper Beverly, Mr.\r\nGreen, although they drew away from him as many as from Mr. Noyes, went\r\nto participate in the raising of their meeting-houses. Of a genial\r\ndisposition, he countenanced innocent amusements. He was fond of the\r\nsports of the field. The catamount was among the trophies of his sure\r\naim, and he came home with his huntsman's bag filled with wild pigeons.\r\nHe would take his little sons before and behind him on his horse, and\r\nspend a day with them fishing and fowling on Wilkins's Pond; and, when\r\nIndians threatened the settlements, he would shoulder his musket, join\r\nthe brave young men of his parish, and be the first in the encounter,\r\nand the last to relinquish the pursuit of the savage foe.\r\n\r\nHe was always, everywhere, a peacemaker; by his genial manner, and his\r\ngenuine dignity and decision of character, he removed dissensions from\r\nhis church and neighborhood, and secured the respect while he won the\r\nlove of all. That such a person was raised up and placed where he was\r\nat that time, was truly a providence of God.\r\n\r\nThe part performed in the witchcraft tragedy by the extraordinary child\r\nof twelve years of age, Ann Putnam, has been fully set forth. As has\r\nbeen stated, both her parents (and no one can measure their share of\r\nresponsibility, nor that of others behind them, for her conduct) died\r\nwithin a fortnight of each other, in 1699. She was then nineteen years\r\nof age; a large family of children, all younger than herself, was left\r\nwith her in the most melancholy orphanage. How many there were, we do\r\nnot exactly know: eight survived her. Although their uncles, Edward and\r\nJoseph, were near, and kind, and able to care for them, the burden\r\nthrown upon her must have been great. With the terrible remembrance of\r\nthe scenes of 1692, it was greater than she could bear. Her health\r\nbegan to decline, and she was long an invalid. Under the tender and\r\nfaithful guidance of Mr. Green, she did all that she could to seek the\r\nforgiveness of God and man. After consultations with him, in visits to\r\nhis study, a confession was drawn up, which she desired publicly to\r\nmake. Upon conferring with Samuel Nurse, it was found to be\r\nsatisfactory to him, as the representative of those who had suffered\r\nfrom her testimony. It was her desire to offer this[ii.510] confession\r\nand a profession of religion at the same time. The day was fixed, and\r\nmade known to the public. On the 25th of August, 1706, a great\r\nconcourse assembled in the meeting-house. Large numbers came from other\r\nplaces, particularly from the town of Salem. The following document,\r\nhaving been judged sufficient and suitable, was written out in the\r\nchurch-book the evening before, and signed by her. It was read by the\r\npastor before the congregation, who were seated; she standing in her\r\nplace while it was read, and owning it as hers by a declaration to that\r\neffect at its close, and also acknowledging the signature.\r\n\r\n_\"The Confession of Anne Putnam, when she was received to Communion,\r\n1706._\r\n\r\n\"I desire to be humbled before God for that sad and humbling providence\r\nthat befell my father's family in the year about '92; that I, then\r\nbeing in my childhood, should, by such a providence of God, be made an\r\ninstrument for the accusing of several persons of a grievous crime,\r\nwhereby their lives were taken away from them, whom now I have just\r\ngrounds and good reason to believe they were innocent persons; and that\r\nit was a great delusion of Satan that deceived me in that sad time,\r\nwhereby I justly fear I have been instrumental, with others, though\r\nignorantly and unwittingly, to bring upon myself and this land the\r\nguilt of innocent blood; though what was said or done by me against any\r\nperson I can truly and uprightly say, before God and man, I did it not\r\nout of any anger, malice, or ill-will to any person, for I had no such\r\nthing against one of them; but what I did was ignorantly, being deluded\r\nby Satan. And particularly, as I was a chief instrument of accusing of\r\nGoodwife Nurse and her two sisters, I desire to lie in the dust, and to\r\nbe humbled for it, in that I was a cause, with others, of so sad a\r\ncalamity to them and their families; for which cause I desire to lie in\r\nthe dust, and earnestly beg forgiveness of God, and from all those unto\r\nwhom I have given just cause of sorrow and offence, whose relations\r\nwere taken away or accused.\r\n\r\n[Signed]     signature\r\n\r\n\"This confession was read before the congregation, together with her\r\nrelation, Aug. 25, 1706; and she acknowledged it.\r\n\r\n\"J. Green, _Pastor_.\r\n\r\nThis paper shows the baleful influence of the doctrine of Satan[ii.511]\r\nthen received. It afforded a refuge and escape from the compunctions of\r\nconscience. The load of sin was easily thrown upon the back of Satan.\r\nThis young woman was undoubtedly sincere in her penitence, and was\r\nforgiven, we trust and believe; but she failed to see the depth of her\r\niniquity, and of those who instigated and aided her, in her false\r\naccusations. The blame, and the deed, were wholly hers and theirs.\r\nSatan had no share in it. Human responsibility cannot thus be avoided.\r\n\r\nWhile, in a certain sense, she imputes the blame to Satan, this\r\ndeclaration of Ann Putnam is conclusive evidence that she and her\r\nconfederate accusers did not believe in any communications having been\r\nmade to them by invisible spirits of any kind. Those persons, in our\r\nday, who imagine that they hold intercourse, by rapping or otherwise,\r\nwith spiritual beings, have sometimes found arguments in favor of their\r\nbelief in the phenomena of the witchcraft trials. But Ann Putnam's\r\nconfession is decisive against this. If she had really received from\r\ninvisible beings, subordinate spirits, or the spirits of deceased\r\npersons, the matters to which she testified, or ever believed that she\r\nhad, she would have said so. On the contrary, she declares that she had\r\nno foundation whatever, from any source, for what she said, but was\r\nunder the subtle and mysterious influence of the Devil himself.\r\n\r\nShe died at about the age of thirty-six years. Her will is dated May\r\n20, 1715, and was presented in probate June 29, 1716. Its preamble is\r\nas follows:—\r\n\r\n\"In the name of God, amen. I, Anne Putnam, of the town of Salem, single\r\nwoman, being oftentimes sick and weak in body, but of a disposing mind\r\nand memory, blessed be God! and calling to mind the mortality of my\r\nbody, and that it is appointed for all men once to die, do make this my\r\nlast will and testament. First of all, I recommend my spirit into the\r\nhands of God, through Jesus Christ my Redeemer, with whom I hope to\r\nlive for ever; and, as for my body, I commit it to the earth, to be\r\nburied in a Christian and decent manner, at the discretion of my\r\nexecutor, hereafter named, nothing doubting but, by the mighty power of\r\nGod, to receive the same again at the resurrection.\"\r\n\r\nShe divided her land to her four brothers, and her personal estate to\r\nher four sisters.\r\n\r\nIt seems that she was frequently the subject of sickness, and[ii.512]\r\nher bodily powers much weakened. The probability is, that the\r\nlong-continued strain kept upon her muscular and nervous organization,\r\nduring the witchcraft scenes, had destroyed her constitution. Such\r\nuninterrupted and vehement exercise, to their utmost tension, of the\r\nimaginative, intellectual, and physical powers, in crowded and heated\r\nrooms, before the public gaze, and under the feverish and consuming\r\ninfluence of bewildering and all but delirious excitement, could hardly\r\nfail to sap the foundations of health in so young a child. The\r\ntradition is, that she had a slow and fluctuating decline. The language\r\nof her will intimates, that, at intervals, there were apparent checks\r\nto her disease, and rallies of strength,—\"oftentimes sick and weak in\r\nbody.\" She inherited from her mother a sensitive and fragile\r\nconstitution; but her father, although brought to the grave, probably\r\nby the terrible responsibilities and trials in which he had been\r\ninvolved, at a comparatively early age, belonged to a long-lived race\r\nand neighborhood. The opposite elements of her composition struggled in\r\na protracted contest,—on the one side, a nature morbidly subject to\r\nnervous excitability sinking under the exhaustion of an overworked,\r\noverburdened, and shattered system; on the other, tenacity of life. The\r\nconflict continued with alternating success for years; but the latter\r\ngave way at last. Her story, in all its aspects, is worthy of the study\r\nof the psychologist. Her confession, profession, and death point the\r\nmoral.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Joseph Green died Nov. 26, 1715. The following tribute to his\r\nmemory is inscribed on the records of the church. It is in the\r\nhandwriting, and style of thought and language, of Deacon Edward\r\nPutnam.\r\n\r\n\"Then was the choicest flower and greenest olive-tree in the garden of\r\nour God here cut down in its prime and flourishing estate at the age of\r\nforty years and two days, who had been a faithful ambassador from God\r\nto us eighteen years. Then did that bright star set, and never more to\r\nappear here among us; then did our sun go down; and now what darkness\r\nis come upon us! Put away and pardon our iniquities, O Lord! which have\r\nbeen the cause of thy sore displeasure, and return to us again in\r\nmercy, and provide yet again for this thy flock a pastor after thy own\r\nheart, as thou hath promised to thy people in thy word; on which\r\npromise we have hope, for we are called by thy name; and, oh, leave us\r\nnot!\" [ii.513]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Peter Clark was ordained June 5, 1717. The termination of the\r\nconnection between the Salem Village church and the witchcraft\r\ndelusion, and all similar kinds of absurdity and wickedness, is marked\r\nby the following record, which fully and for ever redeems its\r\ncharacter. If Samuel Parris had been as wise and brave as Peter Clark,\r\nhe would, in the same decisive manner, have nipped the thing in the\r\nbud.\r\n\r\n_\"Salem Village Church Records._\r\n\r\n\"Sept. 5, 1746.—At a church meeting appointed on the lecture, the day\r\nbefore, on the occasion of several persons in this parish being\r\nreported to have resorted to a woman of a very ill reputation,\r\npretending to the art of divination and fortune-telling, &c., to make\r\ninquiry into that matter, and to take such resolutions as may be\r\nthought proper on the occasion, the brethren of the church then present\r\ncame into the following votes; viz., That for Christians, especially\r\nchurch-members, to seek to and consult reputed witches or\r\nfortune-tellers, this church is clearly of opinion, and firmly believes\r\non the testimony of the Word of God, is highly impious and scandalous,\r\nbeing a violation of the Christian covenant sealed in baptism,\r\nrendering the persons guilty of it subject to the just censure of the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\n\"No proof appearing against any of the members of this church (some of\r\nwhom had been strongly suspected of this crime), so as to convict them\r\nof their being guilty, it was further voted, That the pastor, in the\r\nname of the church, should publicly testify their disapprobation and\r\nabhorrence of this infamous and ungodly practice of consulting witches\r\nor fortune-tellers, or any that are reputed such; exhorting all under\r\ntheir watch, who may have been guilty of it, to an hearty repentance\r\nand returning to God, earnestly seeking forgiveness in the blood of\r\nChrist, and warning all against the like practice for the time to come.\r\n\r\n\"Sept. 7.—This testimony, exhortation, and warning, voted by the\r\nchurch, was publicly given by the pastor, before the dismission of the\r\ncongregation.\"\r\n\r\nThe Salem Village Parish, when its present pastor, the Rev. Charles B.\r\nRice, was settled, Sept. 2, 1863, had been in existence a hundred and\r\nninety-one years. During its first twenty-five years, it had four\r\nministers, whose aggregate period of service was eighteen years. During\r\nthe succeeding hundred and sixty-six years, it had four ministers,\r\nwhose aggregate period of service[ii.514] was one hundred and\r\nfifty-eight years. They had all been well educated, several were men of\r\nuncommon endowments, and without exception they possessed qualities\r\nsuitable for success and usefulness in their calling.\r\n\r\nThe first period was filled with an uninterrupted series of troubles,\r\nquarrels, and animosities, culminating in the most terrific and\r\nhorrible disaster that ever fell upon a people. The second period was\r\nan uninterrupted reign of peace, harmony, and unity; no religious\r\nsociety ever enjoying more comfort in its privileges, or exhibiting a\r\nbetter example of all that ought to characterize a Christian\r\ncongregation.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the lives of its ministers, in the two periods\r\nrespectively, is as great as between their pastorates. The first four\r\nsuffered from inadequate means of support, and, owing to the feuds in\r\nthe congregation, rates not being collected, were hardly supplied with\r\nthe necessaries of life. There is no symptom in the records of the\r\nsecond period of there having ever been any difficulty on this score.\r\nThe prompt fulfilment of their contracts by the people, and the favor\r\nof Providence, placed the ministers above the reach or approach of\r\ninconvenience or annoyance from that quarter.\r\n\r\nThe history of the New-England churches presents no epoch more\r\nmelancholy, distressful, and stormy than the first, and none more\r\nunited, prosperous, or commendable than the second period in the annals\r\nof the Salem Village church.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the fortunes and fates of the ministers of these\r\ntwo periods is worthy of being stated in detail.\r\n\r\nJames Bayley began to preach at the Village at the formation of the\r\nsociety, when he was quite a young man, within three years from\r\nreceiving his degree at Harvard College. After about seven years,\r\nduring which he buried his wife and three children, and encountered a\r\nbitter and turbulent opposition,—so far as we can see, most causeless\r\nand unreasonable,—he relinquished the ministry altogether, and spent\r\nthe residue of his life in another profession elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe ministry of George Burroughs, at the Village, lasted about two\r\nyears. The violence of both parties to the controversy by which the\r\nparish had been rent was concentrated upon his innocent and unsheltered\r\nhead. He was, at a public assembly of his[ii.515] people, in his own\r\nmeeting-house, arrested, and taken out in the custody of the marshal of\r\nthe county, a prisoner for a debt incurred to meet the expenses of his\r\nwife's recent funeral, of an amount less than the salary then due him,\r\nand which, in point of fact, he had paid at the time by an order upon\r\nthe parish treasurer. From such outrageous ill-treatment, he escaped by\r\nresigning his ministry. He was followed to his retreat in a remote\r\nsettlement, and while engaged there, a laborious, self-sacrificing, and\r\ndevoted minister, was, by the malignity of his enemies at the Village,\r\nsuddenly seized, all unconscious of having wronged a human creature,\r\nsnatched from the table where he was taking his frugal meal in his\r\nhumble home, torn from his helpless family, hurried up to the Village;\r\noverwhelmed in a storm of falsehood, rage, and folly; loaded with\r\nirons, immured in a dungeon, carried to the place of execution,\r\nconsigned to the death of a felon; and his uncoffined remains thrown\r\namong the clefts of the rocks of Witch Hill, and left but half\r\nburied,—for a crime of which he was as innocent as the unborn child.\r\n\r\nDeodat Lawson, a great scholar and great preacher, after a two years'\r\ntrial, and having buried his wife and daughter at the Village,\r\nabandoned the attempt to quell the storm of passion there. He found\r\nanother settlement on the other side of Massachusetts Bay, which he\r\nleft without taking leave, and was never heard of more by his people.\r\nEight years afterwards, he re-appeared in the reprint, at London, of\r\nhis famous Salem Village sermon, and then vanished for ever from sight.\r\nA cloud of impenetrable darkness envelopes his name at that point. Of\r\nhis fate nothing is known, except that it was an \"unhappy\" one.\r\n\r\nSamuel Parris, after a ministry of seven years, crowded from the very\r\nbeginning with contention and animosity, and closed in desolation,\r\nruin, and woes unutterable, havoc scattered among his people and the\r\nwhole country round, was driven from the parish, the blood of the\r\ninnocent charged upon his head, and, for the rest of his days,\r\nconsigned to obscurity and penury. The place of his abode has upon it\r\nno habitation or structure of man; and the only vestiges left of him\r\nare his records of the long quarrel with his congregation, and his\r\ninscription on the headstone, erected by him, as he left the Village\r\nfor ever, over the fresh grave of his wife.[ii.516]\r\n\r\nSurely, the annals of no church present a more dismal, shocking, or\r\nshameful history than this.\r\n\r\nJoseph Green, on the 26th of November, 1715, terminated with his life a\r\nministry of eighteen years, as useful, beneficent, and honorable as it\r\nhad been throughout harmonious and happy. Peter Clark died in office,\r\nJune 10, 1768, after a service of fifty-one years. He was recognized\r\nthroughout the country as an able minister and a learned divine. Peace\r\nand prosperity reigned, without a moment's intermission, among the\r\npeople of his charge. Benjamin Wadsworth, D.D., also died in office,\r\nJan. 18, 1826, after a service of fifty-four years. Through life he was\r\nuniversally esteemed and loved in all the churches. Milton P. Braman,\r\nD.D., on the 1st of April, 1861, terminated by resignation a ministry\r\nof thirty-five years. He always enjoyed universal respect and\r\naffection, and the parish under his care, uninterrupted union and\r\nprosperity. He did not leave his people, but remains among them,\r\nparticipating in the enjoyment of their privileges, and upholding the\r\nhands of his successor. His eminent talents are occasionally exercised\r\nin neighboring pulpits, and in other services of public usefulness. He\r\nlives in honored retirement on land originally belonging to Nathaniel\r\nPutnam, distant only a few rods, a little to the north of east, from\r\nthe spot owned and occupied by his first predecessor, James Bayley.\r\n\r\nIt can be said with assurance, of this epoch in the history of the\r\nSalem Village church and society, that it can hardly be paralleled in\r\nall that indicates the well-being of man or the blessings of Heaven. No\r\nsuch contrast, as these two periods in the annals of this parish\r\npresent, can elsewhere be found.\r\n\r\nProsecutions for witchcraft continued in the older countries after they\r\nhad been abandoned here; although it soon began to be difficult,\r\neverywhere, to procure the conviction of a person accused of\r\nwitchcraft. In 1716, a Mrs. Hicks and her daughter, the latter aged\r\nnine years, were hanged in Huntingdon, in England, for witchcraft. In\r\nthe year 1720, an attempt, already alluded to, was made to renew the\r\nSalem excitement in Littleton, Mass., but it failed: the people had\r\nlearned wisdom at a price too dear to allow them so soon to forget it.\r\nIn a letter to Cotton Mather, written Feb. 19, 1720, the excellent Dr.\r\nWatts, after having expressed his doubts respecting the sufficiency of\r\nthe spec[ii.517]tral evidence for condemnation, says, in reference to\r\nthe Salem witchcraft, \"I am much persuaded that there was much\r\nimmediate agency of the Devil in these affairs, and perhaps there were\r\nsome real witches too.\" Not far from this time, we find what was\r\nprobably the opinion of the most liberal-minded and cultivated people\r\nin England expressed in the following language of Addison: \"To speak my\r\nthoughts freely, I believe, in general, that there is and has been such\r\na thing as witchcraft, but, at the same time, can give no credit to any\r\nparticular instance of it.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an execution for witchcraft in Scotland in 1722. As late as\r\nthe middle of the last century, an annual discourse, commemorative of\r\nexecutions that took place in Huntingdon during the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth, continued to be delivered in that place. An act of a\r\nPresbyterian synod in Scotland, published in 1743, and reprinted at\r\nGlasgow in 1766, denounced as a national sin the repeal of the penal\r\nlaws against witchcraft.\r\n\r\nBlackstone, the great oracle of British law, and who flourished in the\r\nlatter half of the last century, declared his belief in witchcraft in\r\nthe following strong terms: \"To deny the possibility, nay, the actual\r\nexistence, of witchcraft and sorcery, is at once flatly to contradict\r\nthe revealed Word of God, in various passages both of the Old and New\r\nTestament; and the thing itself is a truth to which every nation in the\r\nworld hath in its turn borne testimony, either by examples seemingly\r\nwell attested, or by prohibitory laws, which at least suppose the\r\npossibility of commerce with evil spirits.\"\r\n\r\nIt is related, in White's \"Natural History of Selborne,\" that, in the\r\nyear 1751, the people of Tring, a market town of Hertfordshire, and\r\nscarcely more than thirty miles from London, \"seized on two\r\nsuperannuated wretches, crazed with age and overwhelmed with\r\ninfirmities, on a suspicion of witchcraft.\" They were carried to the\r\nedge of a horse-pond, and there subjected to the water ordeal. The\r\ntrial resulted in the acquittal of the prisoners; but they were both\r\ndrowned in the process.\r\n\r\nA systematic effort seems to have been made during the eighteenth\r\ncentury to strengthen and renew the power of superstition. Alarmed by\r\nthe progress of infidelity, many eminent and excellent men availed\r\nthemselves of the facilities which their position at the head of the\r\nprevailing literature afforded them, to push the[ii.518] faith of the\r\npeople as far as possible towards the opposite extreme of credulity. It\r\nwas a most unwise, and, in its effects, deplorable policy. It was a\r\nbetrayal of the cause of true religion. It was an acknowledgment that\r\nit could not be vindicated before the tribunal of severe reason.\r\nBesides all the misery produced by filling the imagination with unreal\r\nobjects of terror, the restoration to influence, during the last\r\ncentury, of the fables and delusions of an ignorant age, has done\r\nincalculable injury, by preventing the progress of Christian truth and\r\nsound philosophy; thus promoting the cause of the very infidelity it\r\nwas intended to check. The idea of putting down one error by setting up\r\nanother cannot have suggested itself to any mind that had ever been led\r\nto appreciate the value or the force of truth. But this was the policy\r\nof Christian writers from the time of Addison to that of Johnson. The\r\nlatter expressly confesses, that it was necessary to maintain the\r\ncredit of the belief of the existence and agency of ghosts, and other\r\nsupernatural beings, in order to help on the argument for a future\r\nstate as founded upon the Bible.\r\n\r\nDr. Hibbert, in his excellent book on the \"Philosophy of Apparitions,\"\r\nillustrates some remarks similar to those just made, by the following\r\nquotation from Mr. Wesley:—\r\n\r\n\"It is true, that the English in general, and indeed most of the men in\r\nEurope, have given up all accounts of witches and apparitions as mere\r\nold wives' fables. I am sorry for it; and I willingly take this\r\nopportunity of entering my solemn protest against this violent\r\ncompliment, which so many that believe the Bible pay to those who do\r\nnot believe it. I owe them no such service. I take knowledge, these are\r\nat the bottom of the outcry which has been raised, and with such\r\ninsolence spread throughout the nation, in direct opposition, not only\r\nto the Bible, but to the suffrage of the wisest and best men in all\r\nages and nations. They well know (whether Christians know it or not),\r\nthat the giving up witchcraft is, in effect, giving up the Bible. And\r\nthey know, on the other hand, that, if but one account of the\r\nintercourse of men with separate spirits be admitted, their whole\r\ncastle in the air (Deism, Atheism, Materialism) falls to the ground. I\r\nknow no reason, therefore, why we should suffer even this weapon to be\r\nwrested out of our hands. Indeed, there are numerous arguments besides,\r\nwhich abundantly confute their vain imaginations. But we need not be\r\nhooted out of one: neither reason nor religion requires this.\" [ii.519]\r\n\r\nThe belief in witchcraft continued to hold a conspicuous place among\r\npopular superstitions during the whole of the last century. Many now\r\nliving can remember the time when it prevailed very generally. Each\r\ntown or village had its peculiar traditionary tales, which were gravely\r\nrelated by the old, and deeply impressed upon the young.\r\n\r\nThe legend of the \"Screeching Woman\" of Marblehead is worthy of being\r\ngenerally known. The story runs thus: A piratical cruiser, having\r\ncaptured a Spanish vessel during the seventeenth century, brought her\r\ninto Marblehead harbor, which was then the site of a few humble\r\ndwellings. The male inhabitants were all absent on their fishing\r\nvoyages. The pirates brought their prisoners ashore, carried them at\r\nthe dead of the night into a retired glen, and there murdered them.\r\nAmong the captives was an English female passenger. The women who\r\nbelonged to the place heard her dying outcries, as they rose through\r\nthe midnight air, and reverberated far and wide along the silent\r\nshores. She was heard to exclaim, \"O mercy, mercy! Lord Jesus Christ,\r\nsave me! Lord Jesus Christ, save me!\" Her body was buried by the\r\npirates on the spot. The same piercing voice is believed to be heard at\r\nintervals, more or less often, almost every year, in the stillness of a\r\ncalm starlight or clear moonlight night. There is something, it is\r\nsaid, so wild, mysterious, and evidently superhuman in the sound, as to\r\nstrike a chill of dread into the hearts of all who listen to it. The\r\nwriter of an article on this subject, in the \"Marblehead Register\" of\r\nApril 3, 1830, declares, that \"there are not wanting, at the present\r\nday, persons of unimpeachable veracity and known respectability, who\r\nstill continue firmly to believe the tradition, and to assert that they\r\nthemselves have been auditors of the sounds described, which they\r\ndeclare were of such an unearthly nature as to preclude the idea of\r\nimposition or deception.\"\r\n\r\nWhen \"the silver moon unclouded holds her way,\" or when the stars are\r\nglistening in the clear, cold sky, and the dark forms of the moored\r\nvessels are at rest upon the sleeping bosom of the harbor; when no\r\nnatural sound comes forth from the animate or inanimate creation but\r\nthe dull and melancholy rote of the sea along the rocky and winding\r\ncoast,—how often is the watcher startled from the reveries of an\r\nexcited imagination by the pite[ii.520]ous, dismal, and terrific\r\nscreams of the unlaid ghost of the murdered lady!\r\n\r\nA negro died, fifty years ago, in that part of Danvers called\r\noriginally Salem Village, at a very advanced age. He was supposed to\r\nhave reached his hundredth year. He never could be prevailed upon to\r\nadmit that there was any delusion or mistake in the proceedings of\r\n1692. To him, the whole affair was easy of explanation. He believed\r\nthat the witchcraft was occasioned by the circumstance of the Devil's\r\nhaving purloined the church-book, and that it subsided so soon as the\r\nbook was recovered from his grasp. Perhaps the particular hypothesis of\r\nthe venerable African was peculiar to himself; but those persons must\r\nhave a slight acquaintance with the history of opinions in this and\r\nevery other country, who are not aware that the superstition on which\r\nit was founded has been extensively entertained by men of every color,\r\nalmost, if not quite, up to the present day. If the doctrines of\r\ndemonology have been completely overthrown and exterminated in our\r\nvillages and cities, it is a very recent achievement; nay, I fear that\r\nin many places the auspicious event remains to take place.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1808, the inhabitants of Great Paxton, a village of\r\nHuntingdonshire, in England, within sixty miles of London, rose in a\r\nbody, attacked the house of an humble, and, so far as appears,\r\ninoffensive and estimable woman, named Ann Izard, suspected of\r\nbewitching three young females,—Alice Brown, Fanny Amey, and Mary\r\nFox,—dragged her out of her bed into the fields, pierced her arms and\r\nbody with pins, and tore her flesh with their nails, until she was\r\ncovered with blood. They committed the same barbarous outrage upon her\r\nagain, a short time afterwards; and would have subjected her to the\r\nwater ordeal, had she not found means to fly from that part of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the article \"Witchcraft,\" in Rees's \"Cyclopædia,\" gravely\r\nmaintains the doctrine of \"ocular fascination.\"\r\n\r\nProsecutions for witchcraft are stated to have occurred, in the first\r\nhalf of the present century, in some of the interior districts of our\r\nSouthern States. The civilized world is even yet full of necromancers\r\nand thaumaturgists of every kind. The science of \"palmistry\" is still\r\npractised by many a muttering vagrant; and perhaps some in this\r\nneighborhood remember when, in the days[ii.521] of their youthful\r\nfancy, they held out their hands, that their future fortunes might be\r\nread in the lines of their palms, and their wild and giddy curiosity\r\nand anxious affections be gratified by information respecting\r\nwedding-day or absent lover.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated fortune-teller, perhaps, that ever lived, resided\r\nin an adjoining town. The character of \"Moll Pitcher\" is familiarly\r\nknown in all parts of the commercial world. She died in 1813. Her place\r\nof abode was beneath the projecting and elevated summit of High Rock,\r\nin Lynn, and commanded a view of the wild and indented coast of\r\nMarblehead, of the extended and resounding beaches of Lynn and Chelsea,\r\nof Nahant Rocks, of the vessels and islands of Boston's beautiful bay,\r\nand of its remote southern shore. She derived her mysterious gifts by\r\ninheritance, her grandfather having practised them before in\r\nMarblehead. Sailors, merchants, and adventurers of every kind, visited\r\nher residence, and placed confidence in her predictions. People came\r\nfrom great distances to learn the fate of missing friends, or recover\r\nthe possession of lost goods; while the young of both sexes, impatient\r\nof the tardy pace of time, and burning with curiosity to discern the\r\nsecrets of futurity, availed themselves of every opportunity to visit\r\nher lowly dwelling, and hear from her prophetic lips the revelation of\r\nthe most tender incidents and important events of their coming lives.\r\nShe read the future, and traced what to mere mortal eyes were the\r\nmysteries of the present or the past, in the arrangement and aspect of\r\nthe grounds or settlings of a cup of tea or coffee. Her name has\r\neverywhere become the generic title of fortune-tellers, and occupies a\r\nconspicuous place in the legends and ballads of popular superstition.\r\nHer renown has gone abroad to the farthest regions, and her memory will\r\nbe perpetuated in the annals of credulity and imposture. An air of\r\nromance is breathed around the scenes where she practised her mystic\r\nart, the interest and charm of which will increase as the lapse of time\r\nremoves her history back towards the dimness of the distant past.\r\n\r\nThe elements of the witchcraft delusion of 1692 are slumbering still in\r\nthe bosom of society. We hear occasionally of haunted houses, cases of\r\nsecond-sight, and communications from the spiritual world. It always\r\nwill be so. The human mind feels instinctively its connection with a\r\nhigher sphere. Some will ever be[ii.522] impatient of the restraints of\r\nour present mode of being, and prone to break away from them; eager to\r\npry into the secrets of the invisible world, willing to venture beyond\r\nthe bounds of ascertainable knowledge, and, in the pursuit of truth, to\r\naspire where the laws of evidence cannot follow them. A love of the\r\nmarvellous is inherent to the sense of limitation while in these\r\nterrestrial bodies; and many will always be found not content to wait\r\nuntil this tabernacle is dissolved and we shall be clothed upon with a\r\nbody which is from Heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ii.523]\r\n\r\ndecoration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

As this was prepared for that particular occasion\r\nwhen it was delivered amongst you, so the publication of it is to be\r\nparticularly recommended to your service.\r\n\r\nMy heart's desire and continual prayer to God for you all is, that you\r\nmay be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ; and, accordingly,\r\nthat all means he is using with you, by mercies and afflictions,\r\nordinances and providences, may be sanctified to the building you up in\r\ngrace and holiness, and preparing you for the kingdom of glory. We are\r\ntold by the apostle (Acts xiv. 22), that through many tribulations we\r\nmust enter into the kingdom of God. Now, since (besides your share in\r\nthe common calamities, under the burden whereof this poor people are\r\ngroaning at this time) the righteous and holy God hath been pleased to\r\npermit a sore and grievous affliction to befall you, such as can hardly\r\nbe said to be common to men; viz., by giving liberty to Satan to range\r\nand rage amongst you, to the torturing the bodies and distracting the\r\nminds of some of the visible sheep and lambs of the Lord Jesus Christ.\r\nAnd (which is yet more astonishing) he who is the accuser of the\r\nbrethren endeavors to introduce as criminal some of the visible\r\nsubjects of Christ's kingdom, by whose sober and godly conversation in\r\ntimes[ii.526] past we could draw no other conclusions than that they\r\nwere real members of his mystical body, representing them as the\r\ninstruments of his malice against their friends and neighbors.\r\n\r\nI thought meet thus to give you the best assistance I could, to help\r\nyou out of your distresses. And since the ways of the Lord, in his\r\npermissive as well as effective providence, are unsearchable, and his\r\ndoings past finding out, and pious souls are at a loss what will be the\r\nissue of these things, I therefore bow my knees unto the God and Father\r\nof our Lord Jesus Christ, that he would cause all grace to abound to\r\nyou and in you, that your poor place may be delivered from those\r\nbreaking and ruining calamities which are threatened as the pernicious\r\nconsequences of Satan's malicious operations; and that you may not be\r\nleft to bite and devour one another in your sacred or civil society, in\r\nyour relations or families, to the destroying much good and promoting\r\nmuch evil among you, so as in any kind to weaken the hands or\r\ndiscourage the heart of your reverend and pious pastor, whose family\r\nalso being so much under the influence of these troubles, spiritual\r\nsympathy cannot but stir you up to assist him as at all times, so\r\nespecially at such a time as this; he, as well as his neighbors, being\r\nunder such awful circumstances. As to this discourse, my humble desire\r\nand endeavor is, that it may appear to be according to the form of\r\nsound words, and in expressions every way intelligible to the meanest\r\ncapacities. It pleased God, of his free grace, to give it some\r\nacceptation with those that heard it, and some that heard of it desired\r\nme to transcribe it, and afterwards to give way to the printing of it.\r\nI present it therefore to your acceptance, and commend it to the divine\r\nbenediction; and that it may please the Almighty God to manifest his\r\npower in putting an end to your sorrows of this nature, by bruising\r\nSatan under your feet shortly, causing these and all other your and our\r\ntroubles to work together for our good now, and salvation in the day of\r\nthe Lord, is the unfeigned desire, and shall be the uncessant prayer,\r\nof—\r\n\r\nLess than the least, of all those that serve,\r\n\r\nIn the Gospel of our Lord Jesus,\r\n\r\nDEODAT LAWSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ii.527]\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nDEODAT LAWSON'S NARRATIVE.\r\n\r\n[Appended to his Sermon, London edition, 1704.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the request of several worthy ministers and Christian friends, I do\r\nhere annex, by way of appendix to the preceding sermon, some brief\r\naccount of those amazing things which occasioned that discourse to be\r\ndelivered. Let the reader please therefore to take it in the brief\r\nremarks following, and judge as God shall incline him.\r\n\r\nIt pleased God, in the year of our Lord 1692, to visit the people at a\r\nplace called Salem Village, in New England, with a very sore and\r\ngrievous affliction, in which they had reason to believe that the\r\nsovereign and holy God was pleased to permit Satan and his instruments\r\nto affright and afflict those poor mortals in such an astonishing and\r\nunusual manner.\r\n\r\nNow, I having for some time before attended the work of the ministry in\r\nthat village, the report of those great afflictions came quickly to my\r\nnotice, and the more readily because the first person afflicted was in\r\nthe minister's family who succeeded me after I was removed from them.\r\nIn pity, therefore, to my Christian friends and former acquaintance\r\nthere, I was much concerned about them, frequently consulted with them,\r\nand fervently, by divine assistance, prayed for them; but especially my\r\nconcern was augmented when it was reported, at an examination of a\r\nperson suspected for witchcraft, that my wife and daughter, who died\r\nthree years before, were sent out of the world under the malicious\r\noperations of the infernal powers, as is more fully represented in the\r\nfollowing remarks. I did then desire, and was also desired by some\r\nconcerned in the Court, to be there present, that I might hear what was\r\nalleged in that respect; observing, therefore, when I was amongst them,\r\nthat the case of the afflicted was very amazing and deplorable, and the\r\ncharges brought against the accused such as were ground of suspicions,\r\nyet very intricate, and difficult to draw up right conclusions about\r\nthem; I thought good, for the satisfaction of myself and such of my\r\nfriends as might be curious to inquire into those mysteries of God's\r\nprovidence and Satan's malice, to draw up and keep by me a brief\r\naccount of the most remarkable things that came to my knowledge in\r\nthose affairs, which remarks were afterwards (at my request) revised\r\nand corrected by some who sat judges on the bench in those matters, and\r\nwere now transcribed from the same paper on which they were then\r\nwritten. After this, I being by the providence of God[ii.528] called\r\nover into England in the year 1696, I then brought that paper of\r\nremarks on the witchcraft with me; upon the sight thereof some worthy\r\nministers and Christian friends here desired me to reprint the sermon,\r\nand subjoin the remarks thereunto in way of appendix; but for some\r\nparticular reasons I did then decline it. But now, forasmuch as I\r\nmyself had been an eye and ear witness of most of those amazing things,\r\nso far as they came within the notice of human senses, and the requests\r\nof my friends were renewed since I came to dwell in London, I have\r\ngiven way to the publishing of them, that I may satisfy such as are not\r\nresolved to the contrary, that there may be (and are) such operations\r\nof the powers of darkness on the bodies and minds of mankind by divine\r\npermission, and that those who sat judges on those cases may, by the\r\nserious consideration of the formidable aspect and perplexed\r\ncircumstances of that afflictive providence, be in some measure\r\nexcused, or at least be less censured, for passing sentence on several\r\npersons as being the instruments of Satan in those diabolical\r\noperations, when they were involved in such a dark and dismal scene of\r\nprovidence, in which Satan did seem to spin a finer thread of spiritual\r\nwickedness than in the ordinary methods of witchcraft: hence the\r\njudges, desiring to bear due testimony against such diabolical\r\npractices, were inclined to admit the validity of such a sort of\r\nevidence as was not so clearly and directly demonstrable to human\r\nsenses as in other cases is required, or else they could not discover\r\nthe mysteries of witchcraft. I presume not to impose upon my Christian\r\nor learned reader any opinion of mine how far Satan was an instrument\r\nin God's hand in these amazing afflictions which were on many persons\r\nthere about that time; but I am certainly convinced, that the great God\r\nwas pleased to lengthen his chain to a very great degree for the\r\nhurting of some and reproaching of others, as far as he was permitted\r\nso to do. Now, that I may not grieve any whose relations were either\r\naccused or afflicted in those times of trouble and distress, I choose\r\nto lay down every particular at large, without mentioning any names or\r\npersons concerned (they being wholly unknown here); resolving to\r\nconfine myself to such a proportion of paper as is assigned to these\r\nremarks in this impression of the book, yet, that I may be distinct,\r\nshall speak briefly to the matter under three heads; viz.:—\r\n\r\n1. Relating to the afflicted.\r\n2. Relating to the accused. And,\r\n3. Relating to the confessing witches.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the afflicted.—\r\n\r\n1. One or two of the first that were afflicted complaining of unusual\r\nillness, their relations used physic for their cure; but it was\r\naltogether in vain.\r\n\r\n2. They were oftentimes very stupid in their fits, and could neither\r\nhear nor understand, in the apprehension of the standers-by; so that,\r\nwhen prayer hath been made with some of them in such a manner as might\r\nbe audible in a great congregation, yet, when their fit was off, they\r\ndeclared they did not hear so much as one word thereof.[ii.529]\r\n\r\n3. It was several times observed, that, when they were discoursed with\r\nabout God or Christ, or the things of salvation, they were presently\r\nafflicted at a dreadful rate; and hence were oftentimes outrageous, if\r\nthey were permitted to be in the congregation in the time of the public\r\nworship.\r\n\r\n4. They sometimes told at a considerable distance, yea, several miles\r\noff, that such and such persons were afflicted, which hath been found\r\nto be done according to the time and manner they related it; and they\r\nsaid the spectres of the suspected persons told them of it.\r\n\r\n5. They affirmed that they saw the ghosts of several departed persons,\r\nwho, at their appearing, did instigate them to discover such as (they\r\nsaid) were instruments to hasten their deaths, threatening sorely to\r\nafflict them if they did not make it known to the magistrates. They did\r\naffirm at the examination, and again at the trial of an accused person,\r\nthat they saw the ghosts of his two wives (to whom he had carried very\r\nill in their lives, as was proved by several testimonies), and also\r\nthat they saw the ghosts of my wife and daughter (who died above three\r\nyears before); and they did affirm, that, when the very ghosts looked\r\non the prisoner at the bar, they looked red, as if the blood would fly\r\nout of their faces with indignation at him. The manner of it was thus:\r\nseveral afflicted being before the prisoner at the bar, on a sudden\r\nthey fixed all their eyes together on a certain place of the floor\r\nbefore the prisoner, neither moving their eyes nor bodies for some few\r\nminutes, nor answering to any question which was asked them: so soon as\r\nthat trance was over, some being removed out of sight and hearing, they\r\nwere all, one after another, asked what they saw; and they did all\r\nagree that they saw those ghosts above mentioned. I was present, and\r\nheard and saw the whole of what passed upon that account, during the\r\ntrial of that person who was accused to be the instrument of Satan's\r\nmalice therein.\r\n\r\n6. In this (worse than Gallick) persecution by the dragoons of hell,\r\nthe persons afflicted were harassed at such a dreadful rate to write\r\ntheir names in a Devil-book presented by a spectre unto them: and one,\r\nin my hearing, said, \"I will not, I will not write! It is none of God's\r\nbook, it is none of God's book: it is the Devil's book, for aught I\r\nknow;\" and, when they steadfastly refused to sign, they were told, if\r\nthey would but touch, or take hold of, the book, it should do; and,\r\nlastly, the diabolical propositions were so low and easy, that, if they\r\nwould but let their clothes, or any thing about them, touch the book,\r\nthey should be at ease from their torments, it being their consent that\r\nis aimed at by the Devil in those representations and operations.\r\n\r\n7. One who had been long afflicted at a stupendous rate by two or three\r\nspectres, when they were (to speak after the manner of men) tired out\r\nwith tormenting of her to force or fright her to sign a covenant with\r\nthe Prince of Darkness, they said to her, as in a diabolical and\r\naccursed passion, \"Go your ways, and the Devil go with you; for we will\r\nbe no more pestered and plagued about you.\" And, ever after that, she\r\nwas well, and no more afflicted, that ever I heard of.[ii.530]\r\n\r\n8. Sundry pins have been taken out of the wrists and arms of the\r\nafflicted; and one, in time of examination of a suspected person, had a\r\npin run through both her upper and her lower lip when she was called to\r\nspeak, yet no apparent festering followed thereupon, after it was taken\r\nout.\r\n\r\n9. Some of the afflicted, as they were striving in their fits in open\r\ncourt, have (by invisible means) had their wrists bound fast together\r\nwith a real cord, so as it could hardly be taken off without cutting.\r\nSome afflicted have been found with their arms tied, and hanged upon an\r\nhook, from whence others have been forced to take them down, that they\r\nmight not expire in that posture.\r\n\r\n10. Some afflicted have been drawn under tables and beds by undiscerned\r\nforce, so as they could hardly be pulled out; and one was drawn\r\nhalf-way over the side of a well, and was, with much difficulty,\r\nrecovered back again.\r\n\r\n11. When they were most grievously afflicted, if they were brought to\r\nthe accused, and the suspected person's hand but laid upon them, they\r\nwere immediately relieved out of their tortures; but, if the accused\r\ndid but look on them, they were instantly struck down again. Wherefore\r\nthey used to cover the face of the accused, while they laid their hands\r\non the afflicted, and then it obtained the desired issue: for it hath\r\nbeen experienced (both in examinations and trials), that, so soon as\r\nthe afflicted came in sight of the accused, they were immediately cast\r\ninto their fits; yea, though the accused were among the crowd of people\r\nunknown to the sufferers, yet, on the first view, were they struck\r\ndown, which was observed in a child of four or five years of age, when\r\nit was apprehended, that so many as she could look upon, either\r\ndirectly or by turning her head, were immediately struck into their\r\nfits.\r\n\r\n12. An iron spindle of a woollen wheel, being taken very strangely out\r\nof an house at Salem Village, was used by a spectre as an instrument of\r\ntorture to a sufferer, not being discernible to the standers-by, until\r\nit was, by the said sufferer, snatched out of the spectre's hand, and\r\nthen it did immediately appear to the persons present to be really the\r\nsame iron spindle.\r\n\r\n13. Sometimes, in their fits, they have had their tongues drawn out of\r\ntheir mouths to a fearful length, their heads turned very much over\r\ntheir shoulders; and while they have been so strained in their fits,\r\nand had their arms and legs, &c., wrested as if they were quite\r\ndislocated, the blood hath gushed plentifully out of their mouths for a\r\nconsiderable time together, which some, that they might be satisfied\r\nthat it was real blood, took upon their finger, and rubbed on their\r\nother hand. I saw several together thus violently strained and bleeding\r\nin their fits, to my very great astonishment that my fellow-mortals\r\nshould be so grievously distressed by the invisible powers of darkness.\r\nFor certainly all considerate persons who beheld these things must\r\nneeds be convinced, that their motions in their fits were preternatural\r\nand involuntary, both as to the manner, which was so strange as a well\r\nperson could not (at least without great pain) screw their bodies\r\ninto,[ii.531] and as to the violence also, they were preternatural\r\nmotions, being much beyond the ordinary force of the same persons when\r\nthey were in their right minds; so that, being such grievous sufferers,\r\nit would seem very hard and unjust to censure them of consenting to, or\r\nholding any voluntary converse or familiarity with, the Devil.\r\n\r\n14. Their eyes were, for the most part, fast closed in their\r\ntrance-fits, and when they were asked a question they could give no\r\nanswer; and I do verily believe, they did not hear at that time; yet\r\ndid they discourse with the spectres as with real persons, asserting\r\nthings and receiving answers affirmative or negative, as the matter\r\nwas. For instance, one, in my hearing, thus argued _with_, and railed\r\n_at_, a spectre: \"Goodw—-, begone, begone, begone! Are you not ashamed,\r\na woman of your profession, to afflict a poor creature so? What hurt\r\ndid I ever do you in my life? You have but two years to live, and then\r\nthe Devil will torment your soul for this. Your name is blotted out of\r\nGod's book, and it shall never be put into God's book again. Begone!\r\nFor shame! Are you not afraid of what is coming upon you? I know, I\r\nknow what will make you afraid,—the wrath of an angry God: I am sure\r\nthat will make you afraid. Begone! Do not torment me. I know what you\r\nwould have\" (we judged she meant her soul): \"but it is out of your\r\nreach; it is clothed with the white robes of Christ's righteousness.\"\r\nThis sufferer I was well acquainted with, and knew her to be a very\r\nsober and pious woman, so far as I could judge; and it appears that she\r\nhad not, in that fit, voluntary converse with the Devil, for then she\r\nmight have been helped to a better guess about that woman abovesaid, as\r\nto her living but two years, for she lived not many months after that\r\ntime. Further, this woman, in the same fit, seemed to dispute with a\r\nspectre about a text of Scripture: the apparition seemed to deny it;\r\nshe said she was sure there was such a text, and she would tell it; and\r\nthen said she to the apparition, \"I am sure you will be gone, for you\r\ncannot stand before that text.\" Then was she sorely afflicted,—her\r\nmouth drawn on one side, and her body strained violently for about a\r\nminute; and then said, \"It is, it is, it is,\" three or four times, and\r\nthen was afflicted to hinder her from telling; at last, she broke\r\nforth, and said, \"It is the third chapter of the Revelations.\" I did\r\nmanifest some scruple about reading it, lest Satan should draw any\r\nthereby superstitiously to improve the word of the eternal God; yet\r\njudging I might do it once, for an experiment, I began to read; and,\r\nbefore I had read through the first verse, she opened her eyes, and was\r\nwell. Her husband and the spectators told me she had often been\r\nrelieved by reading texts pertinent to her case,—as Isa. 40, 1, ch. 49,\r\n1, ch. 50, 1, and several others. These things I saw and heard from\r\nher.\r\n\r\n15. They were vehemently afflicted, to hinder any persons praying with\r\nthem, or holding them in any religious discourse. The woman mentioned\r\nin the former section was told by the spectre I should not go to\r\nprayer; but she said I should, and, after I had done, reasoned with the\r\napparition, \"Did not I say he should go to prayer?\" I went also to\r\nvisit a person afflicted in[ii.532] Boston; and, after I was gone into\r\nthe house to which she belonged, she being abroad, and pretty well,\r\nwhen she was told I was there, she said, \"I am loath to go in; for I\r\nknow he will fall into some good discourse, and then I am sure I shall\r\ngo into a fit.\" Accordingly, when she came in, I advised her to improve\r\nall the respite she had to make her peace with God, and sue out her\r\npardon through Jesus Christ, and beg supplies of faith and every grace\r\nto deliver her from the powers of darkness; and, before I had uttered\r\nall this, she fell into a fearful fit of diabolical torture.\r\n\r\n16. Some of them were asked how it came to pass that they were not\r\naffrighted when they saw the _black-man_: they said they were at first,\r\nbut not so much afterwards.\r\n\r\n17. Some of them affirmed they saw the _black-man_ sit on the gallows,\r\nand that he whispered in the ears of some of the condemned persons when\r\nthey were just ready to be turned off, even while they were making\r\ntheir last speech.\r\n\r\n18. They declared several things to be done by witchcraft, which\r\nhappened before some of them were born,—as strange deaths of persons,\r\ncasting away of ships, &c.; and they said the spectres told them of it.\r\n\r\n19. Some of them have sundry times seen a _white-man_ appearing amongst\r\nthe spectres, and, as soon as he appeared, the _black-witches_\r\nvanished: they said this white-man had often foretold them what respite\r\nthey should have from their fits, as sometimes a day or two or more,\r\nwhich fell out accordingly. One of the afflicted said she saw him, in\r\nher fit, and was with him in a glorious place which had no candle nor\r\nsun, yet was full of light and brightness, where there was a multitude\r\nin white, glittering robes, and they sang the song in Rev. 5, 9; Psal.\r\n110, 149. She was loath to leave that place, and said, \"_How long shall\r\nI stay here? Let me be along with you._\" She was grieved she could stay\r\nno longer in that place and company.\r\n\r\n20. A young woman that was afflicted at a fearful rate had a spectre\r\nappeared to her with a white sheet wrapped about it, not visible to the\r\nstanders-by until this sufferer (violently striving in her fit)\r\nsnatched at, took hold, and tore off a corner of that sheet. Her\r\nfather, being by her, endeavored to lay hold upon it with her, that she\r\nmight retain what she had gotten; but, at the passing-away of the\r\nspectre, he had such a violent twitch of his hand as if it would have\r\nbeen torn off: immediately thereupon appeared in the sufferer's hand\r\nthe corner of a sheet,—a real cloth, _visible_ to the spectators, which\r\n(as it is said) remains still to be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE THINGS RELATING TO THE ACCUSED.\r\n\r\n1. A woman, being brought upon public examination, desired to go to\r\nprayer. The magistrates told her they came not there to hear her pray,\r\nbut to examine her in what was alleged against her relating to\r\nsuspicions of witchcraft.\r\n\r\n2. It was observed, both in times of examination and trial, that\r\nthe[ii.533] accused seemed little affected with what the sufferers\r\nunderwent, or what was charged against them as being the instruments of\r\nSatan therein, so that the spectators were grieved at their\r\nunconcernedness.\r\n\r\n3. They were sometimes their _own image_, and not always practising\r\nupon poppets made of clouts, wax, or other materials, (according to the\r\nold methods of witchcraft); for _natural_ actions in them seemed to\r\nproduce preternatural impressions on the afflicted, as biting their\r\nlips in time of examination and trial caused the sufferers to be bitten\r\nso as they produced the marks before the magistrates and spectators:\r\nthe accused pinching their hands together seemed to cause the sufferers\r\nto be _pinched_; those again _stamping_ with their feet, _these_ were\r\ntormented in their legs and feet, so as they _stamped fearfully_. After\r\nall this, if the accused did but lean against the bar at which they\r\nstood, some very sober women of the afflicted complained of their\r\nbreasts, as if their bowels were torn out; thus, some have since\r\nconfessed, they were wont to afflict such as were the objects of their\r\nmalice.\r\n\r\n4. Several were accused of having familiarity with the _black-man_ in\r\ntime of examination and trial, and that he whispered in their ears, and\r\ntherefore they could not hear the magistrates; and that one woman\r\naccused rid (in her shape and spectre) by the place of judicature,\r\nbehind the black man, in the very time when she was upon examination.\r\n\r\n5. When the suspected were standing at the bar, the afflicted have\r\naffirmed that they saw their shapes in other places suckling a yellow\r\nbird; sometimes in one place and posture, and sometimes in another.\r\nThey also foretold that the spectre of the prisoner was going to\r\nafflict such or such a sufferer, which presently fell out accordingly.\r\n\r\n6. They were accused by the sufferers to keep days of hellish fasts and\r\nthanksgivings; and, upon one of their fast-days, they told a sufferer\r\nshe must not eat, it was fast-day. She said she would: they told her\r\nthey would choke her then, which, when she did eat, was endeavored.\r\n\r\n7. They were also accused to hold and administer diabolical sacraments;\r\nviz., a mock-baptism and a Devil-supper, at which cursed imitations of\r\nthe sacred institutions of our blessed Lord they used forms of words to\r\nbe trembled at in the very rehearsing: concerning baptism I shall speak\r\nelsewhere. At their cursed supper, they were said to have red bread and\r\nred drink; and, when they pressed an afflicted person to eat and drink\r\nthereof, she turned away her head, and spit at it, and said, \"I will\r\nnot eat, I will not drink: it is blood. That is not the bread of life,\r\nthat is not the water of life; and I will have none of yours.\" Thus\r\nhorribly doth Satan endeavor to have his kingdom and administrations to\r\nresemble those of our Lord Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n8. Some of the most _sober_ afflicted persons, when they were well, did\r\naffirm the spectres of such and such as they did complain of in their\r\nfits did appear to them, and could relate what passed betwixt them and\r\nthe apparitions, after their fits were over, and give account after\r\nwhat manner they were hurt by them.\r\n\r\n9. Several of the accused would neither in time of examination nor\r\ntrial[ii.534] confess any thing of what was laid to their charge: some\r\nwould not admit of any minister to pray with them, others refused to\r\npray for themselves. It was said by some of the confessing witches,\r\nthat such as have received the Devil-sacrament can never confess: only\r\none woman condemned, after the death-warrant was signed, freely\r\nconfessed, which occasioned her reprieval for some time; and it was\r\nobservable this woman had one lock of hair of a very great length,\r\nviz., four foot and seven inches long by measure. This lock was of a\r\ndifferent color from all the rest, which was short and gray. It grew on\r\nthe hinder part of her head, and was matted together like an elf-lock.\r\nThe Court ordered it to be cut off, to which she was very unwilling,\r\nand said she was told if it were cut off she should die or be sick; yet\r\nthe Court ordered it so to be.\r\n\r\n10. A person who had been frequently transported to and fro by the\r\ndevils for the space of near two years, was struck dumb for about nine\r\nmonths of that time; yet he, after that, had his speech restored to\r\nhim, and did depose upon oath, that, in the time while he was dumb, he\r\nwas many times bodily transported to places where the witches were\r\ngathered together, and that he there saw feasting and dancing; and,\r\nbeing struck on the back or shoulder, was thereby made fast to the\r\nplace, and could only see and hear at a distance. He did take his oath\r\nthat he did, with his bodily eyes, see some of the accused at those\r\nwitch-meetings several times. I was present in court when he gave his\r\ntestimony. He also proved by sundry persons, that, at those times of\r\ntransport, he was bodily absent from his abode, and could nowhere be\r\nfound, but being met with by some on the road, at a distance from his\r\nhome, was suddenly conveyed away from them.\r\n\r\n11. The afflicted persons related that the spectres of several eminent\r\npersons had been brought in amongst the rest; but, as the sufferers\r\nsaid the Devil could not hurt them in their shapes, but two witches\r\nseemed to take them by each hand, and lead them or force them to come\r\nin.\r\n\r\n12. Whiles a godly man was at prayer with a woman afflicted, the\r\ndaughter of that woman (being a sufferer in the like kind) affirmed\r\nthat she saw two of the persons accused at prayer to the Devil.\r\n\r\n13. It was proved by substantial evidences against one person accused,\r\nthat he had such an unusual strength (though a very little man), that\r\nhe could hold out a gun with one hand behind the lock, which was near\r\nseven foot in the barrel, being as much as a lusty man could command\r\nwith both hands after the usual manner of shooting. It was also proved,\r\nthat he lifted barrels of meat and barrels of molasses out of a canoe\r\nalone, and that putting his fingers into a barrel of molasses (full\r\nwithin a finger's length according to custom) he carried it several\r\npaces; and that he put his finger into the muzzle of a gun which was\r\nmore than five foot in the barrel, and lifted up the butt-end thereof,\r\nlock, stock, and all, without any visible help to raise it. It was also\r\ntestified, that, being abroad with his wife and his wife's brother, he\r\noccasionally staid behind, letting his wife and her brother walk\r\nforward; but, suddenly coming up with them, he was angry with his wife\r\nfor what[ii.535] discourse had passed betwixt her and her brother: they\r\nwondering how he should know it, he said, \"I know your thoughts;\" at\r\nwhich expression, they, being amazed, asked him how he could do that;\r\nhe said, \"My God, whom I serve, makes known your thoughts to me.\"\r\n\r\nI was present when these things were testified against him, and\r\nobserved that he could not make any plea for himself (in these things)\r\nthat had any weight: he had the liberty of challenging his jurors\r\nbefore empanelling, according to the statute in that case, and used his\r\nliberty in challenging many; yet the jury that were sworn brought him\r\nin guilty.\r\n\r\n14. The magistrates privately examined a child of four or five years of\r\nage, mentioned in the remarks of the afflicted, sect. 11: [p. 530] and\r\nthe child told them it had a little snake which used to suck on the\r\nlowest joint of its forefinger; and, when they (inquiring where)\r\npointed to other places, it told them not _there_ but _here_, pointing\r\non the lowest joint of the forefinger, where they observed a deep red\r\nspot about the bigness of a flea-bite. They asked it who gave it that\r\nsnake, whether the black man gave it: the child said no, its mother\r\ngave it. I heard this child examined by the magistrates.\r\n\r\n15. It was proved by sundry testimonies against some of the accused,\r\nthat, upon their malicious imprecations, wishes, or threatenings, many\r\nobservable deaths and diseases, with many other odd inconveniences,\r\nhave happened to cattle and other estate of such as were so threatened\r\nby them, and some to the persons of men and women.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE THINGS CONFESSED BY SOME SUSPECTED OF BEING GUILTY OF\r\nWITCHCRAFT.\r\n\r\n1. It pleased God, for the clearer discovery of those mysteries of the\r\nkingdom of darkness, so to dispose, that several persons, men, women,\r\nand children, did confess their hellish deeds, as followeth:—\r\n\r\n2. They confessed against themselves that they were witches, told how\r\nlong they had been so, and how it came about that the Devil appeared to\r\nthem; viz., sometimes upon discontent at their mean condition in the\r\nworld, sometimes about fine clothes, sometimes for the gratifying other\r\ncarnal and sensual lusts. Satan then, upon his appearing to them, made\r\nthem fair (though false) promises, that, if they would yield to him,\r\nand sign his book, their desires should be answered to the uttermost,\r\nwhereupon they signed it; and thus the accursed confederacy was\r\nconfirmed betwixt them and the Prince of Darkness.\r\n\r\n3. Some did affirm that there were some hundreds of the society of\r\nwitches, considerable companies of whom were affirmed to muster in arms\r\nby beat of drum. In time of examinations and trials, they declared that\r\nsuch a man was wont to call them together from all quarters to\r\nwitch-meetings with the sound of a diabolical trumpet.\r\n\r\n4. Being brought to see the prisoners at the bar upon their trials,\r\nthey did affirm in open court (I was then present), that they had\r\noftentimes seen[ii.536] them at witch-meetings, where was feasting,\r\ndancing, and jollity, as also at Devil-sacraments; and particularly\r\nthat they saw such a man —— amongst the rest of the cursed crew, and\r\naffirmed that he did administer the sacrament of Satan to them,\r\nencouraging them to go on in their way, and they should certainly\r\nprevail. They said also that such a woman —— was a deacon, and served\r\nin distributing the diabolical elements: they affirmed that there were\r\ngreat numbers of the witches.\r\n\r\n5. They affirmed that many of those wretched souls had been baptized at\r\nNewbury Falls, and at several other rivers and ponds; and, as to the\r\nmanner of administration, the great Officer of Hell took them up by the\r\nbody, and, putting their heads into the water, said over them, \"Thou\r\nart mine, I have full power over thee:\" and thereupon they engaged and\r\ncovenanted to renounce God, Christ, their sacred baptism, and the whole\r\nway of Gospel salvation, and to use their utmost endeavors to oppose\r\nthe kingdom of Christ, and to set up and advance the kingdom of Satan.\r\n\r\n6. Some, after they had confessed, were very penitent, and did wring\r\ntheir hands, and manifest a distressing sense of what they had done,\r\nand were by the mercies of God recovered out of those snares of the\r\nkingdom of darkness.\r\n\r\n7. Several have confessed against their own mothers, that they were\r\ninstruments to bring them into the Devil's covenant, to the undoing of\r\nthem, body and soul; and some girls of eight or nine years of age did\r\ndeclare, that, after they were so betrayed by their mothers to the\r\npower of Satan, they saw the Devil go in their own shapes to afflict\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n8. Some of those that confessed were immediately afflicted at a\r\ndreadful rate, after the same manner with the other sufferers.\r\n\r\n9. Some of them confessed, that they did afflict the sufferers\r\naccording to the time and manner they were accused thereof; and, being\r\nasked what they did to afflict them, some said that they pricked pins\r\ninto poppets made with rags, wax, and other materials: one that\r\nconfessed after the signing the death-warrant said she used to afflict\r\nthem by clutching and pinching her hands together, and wishing in what\r\npart and after what manner she would have them afflicted, and it was\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n10. They confessed the design was laid by this witchcraft to root out\r\nthe interest of Christ in New England, and that they began at the\r\nVillage in order to settling the kingdom of darkness and the powers\r\nthereof; declaring that such a man —— was to be head conjurer, and for\r\nhis activity in that affair was to be crowned king of hell, and that\r\nsuch a woman —— was to be queen of hell.\r\n\r\nThus I have given my reader a brief and true account of those fearful\r\nand amazing operations and intrigues of the Prince of Darkness: and I\r\nmust call them so; for, let some persons be as incredulous as they\r\nplease about the powerful and malicious influence of evil angels upon\r\nthe minds and bodies of mankind, _sure I am_ none that observed those\r\nthings above mentioned could refer them to any other head than the\r\nsovereign permission of the holy God,[ii.537] and the malicious\r\noperations of his and our implacable enemy. I have here related nothing\r\nmore than what was acknowledged to be true by the judges that sat on\r\nthe bench, and other credible persons there, which I have without\r\nprejudice or partiality represented.\r\n\r\nI therefore close all with my uncessant prayers, that the great and\r\neverlasting Jehovah would, for the sake of his blessed Son, our most\r\nglorious intercessor, rebuke Satan, and so vanquish him, from time to\r\ntime, that his power may be more and more every day suppressed, his\r\nkingdom destroyed; and that all his malicious and accursed instruments\r\nin those spiritual wickednesses may gnash their teeth, melt away, and\r\nbe ashamed in their secret places, till they come to be judged and\r\ncondemned unto the place of everlasting burnings prepared for the Devil\r\nand his angels, that they may there be tormented with him for ever and\r\never.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ii.538]\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM R.P. TO JONATHAN CORWIN.\r\n\r\nSalisbury, Aug. 9, 1692.\r\n\r\nHonored Sir,—According as in my former to you I hinted that I held\r\nmyself obliged to give you some farther account of my rude though\r\nsolemn thoughts of that great case now before you, the happy management\r\nwhereof do so much conduce to the glory of God, the safety and\r\ntranquillity of the country, besides what I have said in my former and\r\nthe enclosed, I further humbly present to consideration the\r\ndoubtfulness and unsafety of admitting spectre testimony against the\r\nlife of any that are of blameless conversation, and plead innocent,\r\nfrom the uncertainty of them and the incredulity of them; for as for\r\ndiabolical visions, apparitions, or representations, they are more\r\ncommonly false and delusive than real, and cannot be known when they\r\nare real and when feigned, but by the Devil's report; and then not to\r\nbe believed, because he is the father of lies.\r\n\r\n1. Either the organ of the eye is abused and the senses deluded, so as\r\nto think they do see or hear some thing or person, when indeed they do\r\nnot, and this is frequent with common jugglers.\r\n\r\n2. The Devil himself appears in the shape and likeness of a person or\r\nthing, when it is not the person or thing itself; so he did in the\r\nshape of Samuel.\r\n\r\n3. And sometimes persons or things themselves do really appear, but how\r\nit is possible for any one to give a true testimony, which possibly did\r\nsee neither shape nor person, but were deluded; and if they did see any\r\nthing, they know not whether it was the person or but his shape. All\r\nthat can be rationally or truly said in such a case is this,—that I did\r\nsee the shape or likeness of such a person, if my senses or eyesight\r\nwere not deluded: and they can honestly say no more, because they know\r\nno more (except the Devil tells them more); and if he do, they can but\r\nsay he told them so. But the matter is still incredible: first, because\r\nit is but their saying the Devil told them so; if he did so tell them,\r\nyet the verity of the thing remains still unproved, because the Devil\r\nwas a liar and a murtherer (John viii. 44), and may tell these lies to\r\nmurder an innocent person.\r\n\r\nBut this case seems to be solved by an assertion of some, that affirm\r\nthat the Devil do not or cannot appear in the shape of a godly person,\r\nto do hurt: others affirm the contrary, and say that he can and often\r\nhave so done, of[ii.539] which they give many instances for proof of\r\nwhat they say; which if granted, the case remains yet unsolved, and yet\r\nthe very hinge upon which that weighty case depends. To which I humbly\r\nsay: First, That I do lament that such a point should be so needful to\r\nbe determined, which seems not probable, if possible, to be determined\r\nto infallible satisfaction for want of clear Scripture to decide it by,\r\nthough very rational to be believed according to rules; as, for\r\ninstance, if divers examples are alleged of the shape of persons that\r\nhave been seen, of whom there is ample testimony that they lived and\r\ndied in the faith, yet, saith the objecter, 'tis possible they may be\r\nhypocrites, therefore the proof not infallible: and as it may admit of\r\nsuch an objection against the reasons given on the affirmative, much\r\nmore may the same objection be made against the negative, for which\r\nthey can or do give no reason at all, nor can a negative be proved\r\n(therefore difficult to be determined to satisfy infallibly); but,\r\nseeing it must be discussed, I humbly offer these few words: First, I\r\nhumbly conceive that the saints on earth are not more privileged in\r\nthat case than the saints in heaven; but the Devil may appear in the\r\nshape of a saint in heaven, namely, in the shape of Samuel (1 Sam.\r\nxxviii. 13, 14); therefore he can or may represent the shape of a saint\r\nthat is upon the earth. Besides, there may be innocent persons that are\r\nnot saints, and their innocency ought to be their security, as well as\r\ngodly men's; and I hear nobody question but the Devil may take their\r\nshape.\r\n\r\nSecondly, It doth not hurt any man or woman to present the shape or\r\nlikeness of an innocent person, more than for a limner or carver to\r\ndraw his picture, and show it, if he do not in that form do some evil\r\n(nor then neither), if the laws of man do not oblige him to suffer for\r\nwhat the Devil doth in his shape, the laws of God do not.\r\n\r\nThirdly, The Devil had power, by God's permission, to take the very\r\nperson of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the day or time of his humiliation,\r\nand carry him from place to place, and tempted him with temptations of\r\nhorrid blasphemy, and yet left him innocent. Why may we not suppose the\r\nlike may be done to a good man? And why not much more appear in his\r\nshape (or make folk think it is his shape, when indeed it is not), and\r\nyet the person be innocent, being far enough off, and not knowing of\r\nit, nor would consent if he had known it, his profession and\r\nconversation being otherwise?\r\n\r\nFourthly, I suppose 'tis granted by all, that the person of one that is\r\ndead cannot appear, because the soul and body are separated, and so the\r\nperson is dissolved, and so ceaseth to be: and it is as certain that\r\nthe person of the living cannot be in two places at one time, but he\r\nthat is at Boston cannot be at Salem or Cambridge at the same time; but\r\nas the malice and envy in the Devil makes it his business to seek whom\r\nhe may devour, so no question but he doth infuse the same quality into\r\nthose that leave Jesus Christ to embrace him, that they do envy those\r\nthat are innocent, and upon that account be as ready to say and swear\r\nthat they did see them as the Devil is to present their shape to them.\r\nAdd but this also, that, when they are once under his power, he puts\r\nthem on headlong (they must needs go whom the Devil drives,\r\nsaith[ii.540] the proverb), and the reason is clear,—because they are\r\ntaken captive by him, to do his will. And we see, by woful and\r\nundeniable experience, both in the afflicted persons and the\r\nconfessors, some of them, that he torments them at his pleasure, to\r\nforce them to accuse others. Some are apt to doubt they do but\r\ncounterfeit; but, poor souls! I am utterly of another mind, and I\r\nlament them with all my heart; but, take which you please, the case is\r\nthe same as to the main issue. For, if they counterfeit, the wickedness\r\nis the greater in them, and the less in the Devil: but if they be\r\ncompelled to it by the Devil, against their wills, then the sin is the\r\nDevil's, and the sufferings theirs; but if their testimonies be allowed\r\nof, to make persons guilty by, the lives of innocent persons are alike\r\nin danger by them, which is the solemn consideration that do disquiet\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nNow, that the only wise God may so direct you in all, that he may have\r\nglory, the country peace and safety, and your hands strengthened in\r\nthat great work, is the desire and constant prayer of your humble\r\nservant, R.P., who shall no further trouble you at present.\r\n\r\n_Position._—That to put a witch to death is the command of God, and\r\ntherefore the indispensable duty of man,—namely, the magistrate (Ex.\r\nxxii. 18); which, granted, resolves two questions that I have heard\r\nmade by some:—\r\n\r\nFirst, Whether there are any such creatures as witches in the world.\r\nSecondly, If there be, whether they can be known to be such by men:\r\nboth which must be determined on the affirmative, or else that\r\ncommandment were in vain.\r\n\r\n_Position Second._—That it must be witches that are put to death, and\r\nnot innocent persons: \"Thou shalt not condemn the innocent nor the\r\nrighteous\" (Ex. xxiii. 7).\r\n\r\n_Query._—Which premised, it brings to this query,—namely, how a witch\r\nmay be known to be a witch.\r\n\r\n_Answer._—First, By the mouth of two or three witnesses (Deut xix. 15;\r\nMatt. xviii. 16; Deut. xvii. 6). Secondly, They may be known by their\r\nown confession, being _compos mentis_, and not under horrid temptation\r\nto self-murther (2 Sam. xvi.; Josh. vii. 16).\r\n\r\n_Query Second._—What is it that those two or three witnesses must\r\nswear? Must they swear that such a person is a witch? Will that do the\r\nthing, as is vulgarly supposed?\r\n\r\n_Answer._—I think that is too unsafe to go by, as well as hard to be\r\ndone by the advised: First, because it would expose the lives of all\r\nalike to the pleasure or passion of those that are minded to take them\r\naway; secondly, because that, in such a testimony, the witnesses are\r\nnot only informers in matter of fact, but sole judges of the\r\ncrime,—which is the proper work of the judges, and not of witnesses.\r\n\r\n_Query Third._—What is it that the witnesses must testify in the case,\r\nto prove one to be a witch?[ii.541]\r\n\r\n_Answer._—They must witness the person did put forth some act which, if\r\ntrue, was an act of witchcraft, or familiarity with the Devil, the\r\nwitness attest the fact to be upon his certain knowledge, and the\r\njudges to judge that fact to be such a crime.\r\n\r\n_Query Fourth._—What acts are they which must be proved to be committed\r\nby a person, that shall be counted legal proof of witchcraft, or\r\nfamiliarity with the Devil?\r\n\r\n_Answer._—This I do profess to be so hard a question, for want of light\r\nfrom the Word of God and laws of men, that I do not know what to say to\r\nit; and therefore humbly conceive, that, in such a difficulty, it may\r\nbe more safe, for the present, to let a guilty person live till further\r\ndiscovery, than to put an innocent person to death.\r\n\r\nFirst, Because a guilty person may afterward be discovered, and so put\r\nto death; but an innocent person to be put to death cannot be brought\r\nagain to life when once dead.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Because secret things belong to God only, but revealed things\r\nto us and to our children. And though it be so difficult sometimes, yet\r\nwitches there are, and may be known by some acts or other put forth by\r\nthem, that may render them such; for Scripture examples, I can remember\r\nbut few in the Old Testament, besides Balaam (Num. xxii. 6, xxxi. 16).\r\n\r\nFirst, The sorcerers of Egypt could not tell the interpretation of\r\nPharaoh's dream, though he told them his dream (Gen. xli. 8): his\r\nsuccessors afterwards had sorcerers, that by enchantments did, first,\r\nturn their rods into serpents (Exod. vii. 11, 12); second, turned water\r\ninto blood; thirdly, brought frogs upon the land of Egypt (Exod. viii.\r\n7).\r\n\r\nThirdly, Nebuchadnezzar's magicians said that they would tell him the\r\ninterpretation, if he would tell them his dream (Dan. iv. 7); but the\r\nking did not believe them (ver. 8, 9).\r\n\r\nFourthly, The Witch of Endor raised the Devil, in the likeness of\r\nSamuel, to tell Saul his fortune; and Saul made use of him accordingly\r\n(1 Sam. xxviii. 8, 11-15); and, as for New Testament, I see very little\r\nof that nature. Our Lord Jesus Christ did cast out many devils, and so\r\ndid his disciples, both while he was upon earth and afterward, of which\r\nsome were dreadfully circumstanced (Mark ix. 18; Mark v. 2-5); but of\r\nwitches, we only read of four mentioned in the apostles' time: first,\r\nSimon Magus (Acts viii. 9, 11); secondly, Elymas the sorcerer (Acts\r\nxiii. 6, 8); thirdly, the seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, that were\r\nvagabond Jews,—exorcists (Acts xix. 13-16); fourthly, the girl which,\r\nby a spirit of divination, brought her master much gain (Acts xvi. 16),\r\nwhether it were by telling fortunes or finding out lost things, as our\r\ncunning men do, is not said; but something it was that was done by that\r\nspirit which was in her, which, being cast out, she could not do. Now,\r\nwhatever was done by any of these, by the help of the Devil, or by\r\nvirtue of familiarity with him, or that the Devil did do by their\r\nconsent or instigation, it is that which, the like being now proved to\r\nbe done by others, is legal conviction of witchcraft, or familiarity\r\nwith the Devil.[ii.542]\r\n\r\nAs I remember, Mr. Perkins apprehends witchcraft may be sometimes\r\ncommitted by virtue of an implicit covenant with the Devil, though\r\nthere be not explicit covenant visibly between them; namely, by using\r\nsuch words and gestures whereby they do intimate to the Devil what they\r\nwould have him do, and he doth it.\r\n\r\n3. To tell events contingent, or to bring any thing to pass by\r\nsupernatural means, or by no means.\r\n\r\nI have heard of some that make a circle, and mumble over some uncouth\r\nwords; and some that have been spiteful and suspicious persons, that\r\nhave sent for a handful of thatch from the house or barn of him that\r\nthey have owed a spite to, and the house have been burnt as they had\r\nburnt the thatch that they fetched.\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Smith was cast away in the ship built by Mr. Stevens at\r\nGloucester, many years ago, it was said that the woman that was accused\r\nfor doing it did put a dish in a pail of water, and sent her girl\r\nseveral times to see the motion of the dish, till at last it was turned\r\nover, and then the woman said, \"Now Smith is gone,\" _or_ \"is cast\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\nA neighbor of mine, who was a Hampshire man, told me that a suspected\r\nwoman desired something of some of the family, which being denied, she\r\neither muttered or threatened, and some evil suddenly followed, and\r\nthey put her into a cart to carry her to Winchester; and, when they had\r\ngone a little way, the team could not move the cart, though in plain\r\nground. The master commanded to carry a knitch of straw, and burn her\r\nin the cart; which to avoid, she said they should go along, and they\r\ndid. This they did several times before they came to Winchester, of\r\nwhich passages the men that went with her gave their oaths, and she was\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nSome have been transformed into dogs, cats, hares, hogs, and other\r\ncreatures; and in those shapes have sometimes received wounds which\r\nhave made them undeniably guilty, and so confessed. Sometimes having\r\ntheir imps sucking them, or infallible tokens that they are sucked, in\r\nthe search of which great caution to be given, because of some\r\nsuperfluities of nature, and diseases that people are incident unto, as\r\nthe piles, &c., of which the judges are, upon the testimony of the\r\nwitnesses, to determine what of crime is proved by any of these\r\ncircumstances, with many other, in which God is pleased many times, by\r\nsome overt acts, to bring to light that secret wickedness to apparent\r\nconviction, sometimes by their own necessitated confession, whereby\r\nthose that he hath commanded to be put to death may be known to be\r\nsuch, which, when known, then it is a duty to put them to death, and\r\nnot before, though they were as guilty before as then.\r\n\r\nThere are two queries more with respect to what is proper to us in this\r\njuncture of time, of which we have no account of the like being common\r\nat other times, or in other places; namely, these,—\r\n\r\n_Query Fifth._—The fifth query is, what we are to think of those\r\npersons at Salem, or the Village, before whom people are brought for\r\ndetection, or otherwise to be concerned with them, in order to their\r\nbeing apprehended or acquitted.[ii.543]\r\n\r\n_Answer_.—That I am, of all men, the least able to give any conjecture\r\nabout it, because I do not know it, having myself never seen it, nor\r\nknow nothing of it but by report, in which there must be supposed a\r\npossibility of some mistake, in part or in whole; but that which I have\r\nhere heard is this: First, That they do tell who are witches, of which\r\nsome they know, and some they do not. Secondly, They tell who did\r\ntorment such and such a person, though they know not the person.\r\nThirdly, They are tormented themselves by the looks of persons that are\r\npresent, and recovered again by the touching of them. Fourthly, That,\r\nif they look to them, they fall down tormented; but, if the persons\r\naccused look from them, they recover, or do not fall into that torment.\r\nFifthly, They can tell when a person is coming before they see them,\r\nand what clothes they have, and some what they have done for several\r\nyears past, which nobody else ever accused them with, nor do not yet\r\nthink them guilty of. Sixthly, That the dead out of their graves do\r\nappear unto them, and tell them that they have been murdered, and\r\nrequire them to see them to be revenged on the murtherers, which they\r\nname to them; some of which persons are well known to die their natural\r\ndeaths, and publicly buried in the sight of all men. Now, if these\r\nthings be so, I thus affirm,—\r\n\r\nFirst, That whatsoever is done by them that is supernatural, is either\r\ndivine or diabolical.\r\n\r\nSecondly, That nothing is, or can be, divine, but what have God's stamp\r\nupon it, to which he refers for trial (Isa. viii. 19, 20): \"If they\r\nspeak not according to these, there is no light in them.\"\r\n\r\nThirdly, And by that rule none of these actions of theirs have any\r\nwarrant in God's word, but condemned wholly.\r\n\r\nFirst, It is utterly unlawful to inquire of the dead, or to be informed\r\nby them (Isa. viii. 19). It was an act of the Witch of Endor to raise\r\nthe dead, and of a reprobate Saul to inquire of him (1 Sam. xxviii. 8,\r\n11-14; Deut. xviii. 11).\r\n\r\nSecondly, It is a like evil to seek to them that have familiar spirits\r\n(Lev. xix. 31). It was the sin of Saul in the forementioned place (1\r\nSam. xxviii. 8); and of wicked Manasses (2 Kings, xxi. 6).\r\n\r\nThirdly, No more is it likely that their racking and tormenting should\r\nbe done by God or good angels, but by the Devil, whose manner have ever\r\nbeen to be so employed. Witness his dealing with the poor child (Mark\r\nix. 17, 19, 20-22); and with the man that was possessed by him (Mark v.\r\n2-5); besides what he did to Job (Job ii. 7); and all the lies that he\r\ntold against him to the very face of God.\r\n\r\nFourthly, The same may be rationally said of all the rest. Who should\r\ntell them things that they do not see, but the Devil; especially when\r\nsome things that they tell are false and mistaken?\r\n\r\n_Query Sixth_.—These things premised, it now comes to the last and\r\ngreatest question or query; namely, How shall it be known when the\r\nDevil do any of these acts of his own proper motion, without human\r\nconcurrence,[ii.544] consent, or instigation, and when he doth it by\r\nthe suggestion or consent of any person? This question, well resolved,\r\nwould do our business.\r\n\r\nFirst, That the Devil can do acts supernatural without the furtherance\r\nof him by human consent or concurrence; but men or women cannot do them\r\nwithout the help of the Devil (must be granted). That granted, it\r\nfollows, that the Devil is always the doer, but whether abetted in it\r\nby anybody is uncertain.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Will it be sufficient for the Devil himself to say such a man\r\nor woman set him a work to torment such a person by looking upon him?\r\nIs the Devil a competent witness in such a case?\r\n\r\nThirdly, Or are those that are tormented by him legal witnesses to say\r\nthat the Devil doth it by the procurement of such a person, whenas they\r\nknow nothing about it but what comes to them from the Devil (that\r\ntorments them)?\r\n\r\nFourthly, May we believe the witches that do accuse any one because\r\nthey say so (can the fruit be better than the tree)? If the root of all\r\ntheir knowledge be the Devil, what must their testimony be?\r\n\r\nFifthly, Their testimony may be legal against themselves, because they\r\nknow what themselves do, but cannot know what another doth but by\r\ninformation from the Devil: I mean in such cases when the person\r\naccused do deny it, and his conversation is blameless (Prov. xviii. 5;\r\nProv. xix. 5).\r\n\r\nFirst, It is directly contrary to the use of reason, the law of nature,\r\nand principles of humanity, to deny it, and plead innocent, when\r\naccused of witchcraft, and yet, at the same time, to be acting\r\nwitchcraft in the sight of all men, when they know their lives lie at\r\nstake by doing it. Self-interest teaches every one better.\r\n\r\nSecondly, It is contrary to the Devil's nature, or common practice, to\r\naccuse witches. They are a considerable part of his kingdom, which\r\nwould fall, if divided against itself (Matt. xii. 26); except we think\r\nhe that spake the words understood not what he said (which were\r\nblasphemy to think); or that those common principles or maxims are now\r\nchanged; or that the Devil have changed his nature, and is now become a\r\nreformer to purge out witches out of the world, out of the country, and\r\nout of the churches; and is to be believed, though a liar and a\r\nmurtherer from the beginning, and also though his business is going\r\nabout continually, seeking whom he may destroy (1 Pet. v. 8); and his\r\npeculiar subject of his accusation are the brethren: called the accuser\r\nof the brethren.\r\n\r\n_Objection._—God do sometimes bring things to light by his providence\r\nin a way extraordinary.\r\n\r\n_Answer._—It is granted God have so done, and brought hidden things to\r\nlight, which, upon examination, have been proved or confessed, and so\r\nthe way is clear for their execution; but what is that to this case,\r\nwhere the Devil is accuser and witness?\r\n\r\n\r\n[ii.545]\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM MR. PARRIS'S CHURCH RECORDS.\r\n\r\n[The following passages are taken from the records of the Salem Village\r\nChurch, as specimens of Mr. Parris's style of narrative in that\r\ninteresting document, and as shedding some light upon the subject of\r\nthese volumes:—]\r\n\r\n\r\nSab: 4 Nov. [1694].—After sermon in the afternoon, it was propounded to\r\nthe brethren, whether the church ought not to inquire again of our\r\ndissenting brethren after the reason of their dissent. Nothing\r\nappearing from any against it, it was put to vote, and carried in the\r\naffirmative (by all, as far as I know, except one brother, Josh: Rea),\r\nthat Brother Jno. Tarbell should, the next Lord's Day, appear and give\r\nin his reasons in public; the contrary being propounded, if any had\r\naught to object against it. But no dissent was manifested; and so\r\nBrother Nathaniel Putnam and Deacon Ingersoll were desired to give this\r\nmessage from the church to the said Brother Tarbell.\r\n\r\nSab: 11 Nov.—Before the evening blessing was pronounced, Brother\r\nTarbell was openly called again and again; but, he not appearing,\r\napplication was made to the abovesaid church's messengers for his\r\nanswer: whereupon said Brother Putnam reported that the said Brother\r\nTarbell told him he did not know how to come to us on a Lord's Day, but\r\ndesired rather that he might make his appearance some week-day.\r\nWhereupon the congregation was dismissed with the blessing: and the\r\nchurch stayed, and, by a full vote, renewed their call of said Brother\r\nTarbell to appear the next Lord's Day for the ends abovesaid; and\r\nDeacon Putnam and Brother Jonathan Putnam were desired to be its\r\nmessengers to the said dissenting brother.\r\n\r\nSab: 18 Nov.—The said brother came in the afternoon; and, after sermon,\r\nhe was asked the reasons for his withdrawing: whereupon he produced a\r\npaper, which he was urged to deliver to the pastor to communicate to\r\nthe church; but he refused it, asking who was the church's mouth. To\r\nwhich, when he was answered, \"The pastor,\" he replied, Not in this\r\ncase, because his offence was with him. The pastor demanded whether he\r\nhad offence against any of the church besides the pastor. He answered,\r\n\"No.\" So at length we suffered a non-member, Mr. Jos: Hutchinson, to\r\nread it. After[ii.546] which the pastor read openly before the whole\r\ncongregation his overtures for peace and reconciliation. After which\r\nsaid Tarbell, seemingly (at least) much affected, said, that, if half\r\nso much had been said formerly, it had never come to this. But he added\r\nthat others also were dissatisfied besides himself: and therefore he\r\ndesired opportunity that they might come also, which was immediately\r\ngranted; viz., the 26 instant, at two o'clock.\r\n\r\n26 Nov.—At the public meeting above appointed at the meeting-house,\r\nafter the pastor had first sought the grace of God with us in prayer,\r\nhe then summed up to the church and congregation (among which were\r\nseveral strangers) the occasion of our present assembling, as is hinted\r\nthe last meeting. Then seeing, together with Brother Tarbell, two more\r\nof our dissenting brethren, viz., Sam: Nurse, and Thomas Wilkins (who\r\nhad, to suit their designs, placed themselves in a seat conveniently\r\ntogether), the church immediately, to save further sending for them,\r\nvoted that said Brother Wilkins and Brother Nurse should now, together\r\nwith Brother Tarbell, give in their reasons of withdrawing from the\r\nchurch. Then the pastor applied himself to all these three dissenters,\r\npressing the church's desire upon them. So they produced a paper, which\r\nthey much opposed the coming into the pastor's hands, and his reading\r\nof it; but at length they yielded to it. Whilst the paper was reading,\r\nBrother Nurse looked upon another (which he said was the original):\r\nand, after it was read throughout, he said it was the same with what he\r\nhad. Their paper was as followeth:—\r\n\r\n\"The reasons why we withdraw from communion with the church of Salem\r\nVillage, both as to hearing the word preached, and from partaking with\r\nthem at the Lord's Table, are as followeth:—\r\n\r\n\"1. Why we attend not on public prayer and preaching the word, these\r\nare, (1.) The distracting and disturbing tumults and noises made by the\r\npersons under diabolical power and delusions, preventing sometimes our\r\nhearing and understanding and profiting of the word preached; we\r\nhaving, after many trials and experiences, found no redress in this\r\ncase, accounted ourselves under a necessity to go where we might hear\r\nthe word in quiet. (2.) The apprehensions of danger of ourselves being\r\naccused as the Devil's instruments to molest and afflict the persons\r\ncomplaining, we seeing those whom we had reason to esteem better than\r\nourselves thus accused, blemished, and of their lives bereaved,\r\nforeseeing this evil, thought it our prudence to withdraw. (3.) We\r\nfound so frequent and positive preaching up some principles and\r\npractices by Mr. Parris, referring to the dark and dismal mysteries of\r\niniquity working amongst us, as was not profitable, but offensive. (4.)\r\nNeither could we, in conscience, join with Mr. Parris in many of the\r\nrequests which he made in prayer, referring to the trouble then among\r\nus and upon us; therefore thought it our most safe and peaceable way to\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\n\"2. The reasons why we hold not communion with them at the\r\nLord's[ii.547] Table are, first, we esteem ourselves justly aggrieved\r\nand offended with the officer who doth administer, for the reasons\r\nfollowing: (1.) From his declared and published principles, referring\r\nto our molestation from the invisible world, differing from the opinion\r\nof the generality of the Orthodox ministers of the whole country. (2.)\r\nHis easy and strong faith and belief of the affirmations and\r\naccusations made by those they call the afflicted. (3.) His laying\r\naside that grace which, above all, we are required to put on; namely,\r\ncharity toward his neighbors, and especially towards those of his\r\nchurch, when there is no apparent reason for the contrary. (4.) His\r\napproving and practising unwarrantable and ungrounded methods for\r\ndiscovering what he was desirous to know referring to the bewitched or\r\npossessed persons, as in bringing some to others, and by and from them\r\npretending to inform himself and others who were the Devil's\r\ninstruments to afflict the sick and pained. (5.) His unsafe and\r\nunaccountable oath, given by him against sundry of the accused. (6.)\r\nHis not rendering to the world so fair, if true, an account of what he\r\nwrote on examination of the afflicted. (7.) Sundry unsafe, if sound,\r\npoints of doctrine delivered in his preaching, which we esteem not\r\nwarrantable, if Christian. (8.) His persisting in these principles, and\r\njustifying his practices, not rendering any satisfaction to us when\r\nregularly desired, but rather further offending and dissatisfying\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n\"John Tarbell.\r\nTho: Wilkins.\r\nSam: Nurse.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the pastor had read these charges, he asked the dissenters above\r\nmentioned whether they were offended with none in the church besides\r\nhimself. They replied, that they articled against none else. Then the\r\nofficer asked them if they withdrew from communion upon account of none\r\nin the church besides himself. They answered, that they withdrew only\r\nupon my account. Then I read them my \"Meditations for Peace,\" mentioned\r\n18 instant; viz.:—\r\n\r\n\"Forasmuch as it is the undoubted duty of all Christians to pursue\r\npeace (Ps. xxxiv. 14), even unto a reaching of it, if it be possible\r\n(Rom. xii. 18, 19); and whereas, through the righteous, sovereign, and\r\nawful Providence of God, the Grand Enemy to all Christian peace has, of\r\nlate, been most tremendously let loose in divers places hereabouts, and\r\nmore especially amongst our sinful selves, not only to interrupt that\r\npartial peace which we did sometimes enjoy, but also, through his wiles\r\nand temptations and our weaknesses and corruptions, to make wider\r\nbreaches, and raise more bitter animosities between too many of us, in\r\nwhich dark and difficult dispensation we have been all, or most of us,\r\nof one mind for a time, and afterwards of differing apprehensions, and,\r\nat last, are but in the dark,—upon serious thoughts of all, and after\r\nmany prayers, I have been moved to present to you (my beloved flock)\r\nthe following particulars, in way of contribution[ii.548] towards a\r\nregaining of Christian concord (if so be we are not altogether\r\nunappeasable, irreconcilable, and so destitute of the good spirit which\r\nis first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, James\r\niii. 17); viz., (1.) In that the Lord ordered the late horrid calamity\r\n(which afterwards, plague-like, spread in many other places) to break\r\nout first in my family, I cannot but look upon as a very sore rebuke,\r\nand humbling providence, both to myself and mine, and desire so we may\r\nimprove it. (2.) In that also in my family were some of both parties,\r\nviz., accusers and accused, I look also upon as an aggravation of the\r\nrebuke, as an addition of wormwood to the gall. (3.) In that means were\r\nused in my family (though totally unknown to me or mine, except\r\nservants, till afterwards) to raise spirits and create apparitions in\r\nno better than a diabolical way, I do look upon as a further rebuke of\r\nDivine Providence. And by all, I do humbly own this day, before the\r\nLord and his people, that God has been righteously spitting in my face\r\n(Num. xii. 14). And I desire to lie low under all this reproach, and to\r\nlay my hand upon my mouth. (4.) As to the management of those\r\nmysteries, as far as concerns myself, I am very desirous (upon farther\r\nlight) to own any errors I have therein fallen into, and can come to a\r\ndiscerning of. In the mean while, I do acknowledge, upon\r\nafter-considerations, that, were the same troubles again, (which the\r\nLord, of his rich mercy, for ever prevent), I should not agree with my\r\nformer apprehensions in all points; as, for instance, (1.) I question\r\nnot but God sometimes suffers the Devil (as of late) to afflict in the\r\nshape of not only innocent but pious persons, or so delude the senses\r\nof the afflicted that they strongly conceit their hurt is from such\r\npersons, when, indeed, it is not. (2.) The improving of one afflicted\r\nto inquire by, who afflicts the others, I fear may be, and has been,\r\nunlawfully used, to Satan's great advantage. (3.) As to my writing, it\r\nwas put upon me by authority; and therein I have been very careful to\r\navoid the wronging of any (_a_). (4). As to my oath, I never meant it,\r\nnor do I know how it can be otherwise construed, than as vulgarly and\r\nevery one understood; yea, and upon inquiry, it may be found so worded\r\nalso. (5.) As to any passage in preaching or prayer, in that sore hour\r\nof distress and darkness, I always intended but due justice on each\r\nhand, and that not according to man, but God (who knows all things most\r\nperfectly), however, through weakness or sore exercise, I might\r\nsometimes, yea, and possibly sundry times, unadvisedly expressed\r\nmyself. (6.) As to several that have confessed against themselves, they\r\nbeing wholly strangers to me, but yet of good account with better men\r\nthan myself, to whom also they are well known, I do not pass so much as\r\na secret condemnation upon them; but rather, seeing God has so\r\namazingly lengthened out Satan's chain in this most formidable outrage,\r\nI much more incline to side with the opinion of those that have grounds\r\nto hope better of them. (7.) As to all that have unduly suffered in\r\nthese matters (either in their persons or relations), through the\r\nclouds of human weakness, and Satan's wiles and sophistry, I do truly\r\nsympathize with them; taking it for granted that such as drew\r\nthemselves clear of this great trans[ii.549]gression, or that have\r\nsufficient grounds so to look upon their dear friends, have hereby been\r\nunder those sore trials and temptations, that not an ordinary measure\r\nof true grace would be sufficient to prevent a bewraying of remaining\r\ncorruption. (8.) I am very much in the mind, and abundantly persuaded,\r\nthat God (for holy ends, though for what in particular is best known to\r\nhimself) has suffered the evil angels to delude us on both hands, but\r\nhow far on the one side or the other is much above me to say. And, if\r\nwe cannot reconcile till we come to a full discerning of these things,\r\nI fear we shall never come to agreement, or, at soonest, not in this\r\nworld. Therefore (9), in fine, The matter being so dark and perplexed\r\nas that there is no present appearance that all God's servants should\r\nbe altogether of one mind, in all circumstances touching the same, I do\r\nmost heartily, fervently, and humbly beseech pardon of the merciful\r\nGod, through the blood of Christ, of all my mistakes and trespasses in\r\nso weighty a matter; and also all your forgiveness of every offence in\r\nthis and other affairs, wherein you see or conceive I have erred and\r\noffended; professing, in the presence of the Almighty God, that what I\r\nhave done has been, as for substance, as I apprehended was\r\nduty,—however through weakness, ignorance, &c., I may have been\r\nmistaken; I also, through grace, promising each of you the like of me.\r\nAnd so again, I beg, entreat, and beseech you, that Satan, the devil,\r\nthe roaring lion, the old dragon, the enemy of all righteousness, may\r\nno longer be served by us, by our envy and strifes, where every evil\r\nwork prevails whilst these bear sway (Isa. iii. 14-16); but that all,\r\nfrom this day forward, may be covered with the mantle of love, and we\r\nmay on all hands forgive each other heartily, sincerely, and\r\nthoroughly, as we do hope and pray that God, for Christ's sake, would\r\nforgive each of ourselves (Matt. xviii. 21 _ad finem_; Col. iii. 12,\r\n13). Put on, therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels\r\nof mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering,\r\nforbearing one another, and forgiving one another. If any man have a\r\nquarrel against any, even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye (Eph.\r\niv. 31, 32). Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and\r\nevil-speaking be put away from you, with all malice; and be ye kind one\r\nto another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God, for\r\nChrist's sake, hath forgiven you. Amen, amen.\r\n\r\nSam: Parris.\r\n\r\n\"26 Nov., 1694.\"\r\n\r\n[In the record, off against (a) as above, the following is in Mr.\r\nParris's writing:]\r\n\r\n(_a_) Added, by the desire of the council, this following paragraph;\r\nviz., Nevertheless, I fear, that, in and through the throng of the many\r\nthings written by me, in the late confusions, there has not been a due\r\nexactness always used; and, as I now see the inconveniency of my\r\nwriting so much on those difficult occasions, so I would lament every\r\nerror of such writings.—Apr. 3, 1695. Idem. S.P.\r\n\r\n[The above passage (_a_) is inserted in a marginal space left for it on\r\na page containing the record of a meeting, Nov. 26, 1694, while it is\r\ndated April 3, 1695, and[ii.550] purports to be added \"by the desire of\r\nthe council,\" which met at the last-named date. There are other\r\nindications, that the record of Mr. Parris's controversy with the\r\ndissatisfied brethren, consequent upon the proceedings in 1692, was\r\nmade originally on separate sheets of paper, and then compiled, and\r\ninscribed in the church-book, as it there appears. There are several\r\nother entries, which refer to dates ahead. He probably made out his\r\nrecord near the close of the struggle which resulted in his dismission,\r\nand left it, on the pages of the book, as his history of the case.\r\nAfter giving his \"Meditations for Peace,\" the record goes on:—]\r\n\r\nAfter I had read these overtures abovesaid, I desired the brethren to\r\ndeclare themselves whether they remained still dissatisfied. Brother\r\nTarbell answered, that they desired to consider of it, and to have a\r\ncopy of what I had read. I replied, that then they must subscribe their\r\nreasons (above mentioned), for as yet they were anonymous: so at\r\nlength, with no little difficulty, I purchased the subscription of\r\ntheir charges by my abovesaid overtures, which I gave, subscribed with\r\nmy name, to them, to consider of; and so this meeting broke up. Note\r\nthat, during this agitation with our dissenting brethren, they\r\nentertained frequent whisperings with comers and goers to them and from\r\nthem; particularly Dan: Andrews, and Tho: Preston from Mr. Israel\r\nPorter, and Jos: Hutchinson, &c.\r\n\r\nNov. 30, 1694.—Brother Nurse and Brother Tarbell (bringing with them\r\nJoseph Putnam and Tho: Preston) towards night came to my house, where\r\nthey found the two deacons and several other brethren; viz., Tho:\r\nPutnam, Jno. Putnam, Jr., Benj. Wilkins, and Ezek: Cheever, besides\r\nLieutenant Jno. Walcot. And Brother Tarbell said they came to answer my\r\npaper, which they had now considered of, and their answer was this;\r\nviz., that they remained dissatisfied, and desired that the church\r\nwould call a council, according to the advice we had lately from\r\nministers.\r\n\r\n[An account has been given, p. 493, of the attempts of the\r\n\"dissatisfied brethren\" to procure a mutual council to decide the\r\ncontroversy between them and Mr. Parris. On the 14th of June, 1694, a\r\nletter was addressed to him, advising him to agree to the call of such\r\na council, signed by John Higginson, of the First Church in Salem;\r\nJames Allen, of the First Church in Boston; John Hale, of the church in\r\nBeverly; Samuel Willard, of the Old South Church in Boston; Samuel\r\nCheever, of the church in Marblehead; and Joseph Gerrish, of the church\r\nin Wenham. Nicholas Noyes joined in the advice, \"with this proviso,\r\nthat he be not chosen one of the council.\" Mr. Parris contrived to\r\navoid following the advice. On the 10th of September, Messrs.\r\nHigginson, Allen, Willard, Cheever, and Gerrish again, in earnest and\r\nquite peremptory terms, renewed their advice in another letter to Mr.\r\nParris. No longer venturing to resist their authority, he yielded, and\r\nconsented to a mutual council, upon certain terms, one of which was,\r\nthat neither of the churches whose ministers had thus forced him to the\r\nmeasure should be of the council. The following passages give the\r\nconclusion of the matter, as related by Mr. Parris in his\r\nrecord-book:—]\r\n\r\nFeb. 12 [1695].—The church met again, as last agreed upon; and, after a\r\nwhile, our dissenting brethren, Tho: Wilkins, Sam: Nurse, and Jno.\r\nTarbell, came also. After our constant way of begging the presence of\r\nGod with us,[ii.551] we desired our dissenting brethren to acquaint us\r\nwhether they would accept of our last proposals, which they desired to\r\nthis day to consider of. They answered, that they were willing to drop\r\nthe six churches from whose elders we had had the advice abovesaid,\r\ndated 14 June last; but they were not free to exclude Ipswich. This\r\nthey stuck unto long, and then desired that they might withdraw a\r\nlittle to confer among themselves about it, which was granted. But they\r\nquickly returned, as resolved for Ipswich as before. We desired them to\r\nnominate the three churches they would have sent to: and, after much\r\ndebate, they did; viz., Rowley, Salisbury, and Ipswich. Whereupon we\r\nvoted, by a full consent, Rowley and Salisbury churches for a part of\r\nthe council, and desired them to nominate a third church. But still\r\nthey insisted on Ipswich, which we told them they were openly informed,\r\nthe last meeting, that we had excepted against. Then they were told\r\nthat we would immediately choose three other churches to join with the\r\ntwo before nominated and voted, if they saw not good to nominate any\r\nmore; or else we would choose two other churches to join with the\r\naforesaid two, if they pleased. They answered, they would be willing to\r\nthat, if Ipswich might be one of them. Then it was asked them, if a\r\ndismission to some other Orthodox church, where they might better\r\nplease themselves, would content them. Brother Tarbell answered, \"Ay,\r\nif we could find a way to remove our livings too.\" Then it was\r\npropounded, whether we could not unite amongst ourselves. The\r\nparticular answer hereunto I remember not; but (I think) such hints\r\nwere given by them as if it were impossible. Thus much time being gone,\r\nit being well towards sunset, and we concluding that it was necessary\r\nthat we should do something ourselves, if they would not (as the elders\r\nhad heretofore desired) accept of our joining with them, we dismissed\r\nthem; and, by a general agreement amongst ourselves, read and voted\r\nletters to the churches at North Boston, Weymouth, Maiden, and Rowley,\r\nfor their help in a council.\r\n\r\n[Mr. Parris's plan of finding refuge in an _ex-parte_ council was\r\nutterly frustrated. On the 1st of March, the \"reverend elders in the\r\nBay accounted it advisable,\" as he expresses it in his records, that\r\nthe First Church and the Old South Church in Boston should be added to\r\nthe council. They wrote to him to that effect, and he had to comply.\r\nThis brought James Allen and Samuel Willard into the council, and\r\ndetermined the character of the result, which, coming from a tribunal\r\ncalled by him to adjudicate the case, and hearing only such evidence as\r\nhe laid before it, so far as it bore against him, was decisive and\r\nfatal. It was as follows:—]\r\n\r\nThe elders and messengers of the churches—met in council at Salem\r\nVillage, April 3, 1695, to consider and determine what is to be done\r\nfor the composure of the present unhappy differences in that\r\nplace,—after solemn invocation of God in Christ for his direction, do\r\nunanimously declare and advise as followeth:—\r\n\r\nI. We judge that, albeit in the late and the dark time of the\r\nconfusions, wherein Satan had obtained a more than ordinary liberty to\r\nbe sifting of this plantation, there were sundry unwarrantable and\r\nuncomfortable steps taken[ii.552] by Mr. Samuel Parris, the pastor of\r\nthe church in Salem Village, then under the hurrying distractions of\r\namazing afflictions; yet the said Mr. Parris, by the good hand of God\r\nbrought unto a better sense of things, hath so fully expressed it, that\r\na Christian charity may and should receive satisfaction therewith.\r\n\r\nII. Inasmuch as divers Christian brethren in the church of Salem\r\nVillage have been offended at Mr. Parris for his conduct in the time of\r\nthe difficulties and calamities which have distressed them, we now\r\nadvise them charitably to accept the satisfaction which he hath\r\ntendered in his Christian acknowledgments of the errors therein\r\ncommitted; yea, to endeavor, as far as 'tis possible, the fullest\r\nreconciliation of their minds unto communion with him, in the whole\r\nexercise of his ministry, and with the rest of the church (Matt. vi.\r\n12-14; Luke xvii. 3; James v. 16).\r\n\r\nIII. Considering the extreme trials and troubles which the dissatisfied\r\nbrethren in the church of Salem Village have undergone in the day of\r\nsore temptation which hath been upon them, we cannot but advise the\r\nchurch to treat them with bowels of much compassion, instead of all\r\nmore critical or rigorous proceedings against them, for the infirmities\r\ndiscovered by them in such an heart-breaking day. And if, after a\r\npatient waiting for it, the said brethren cannot so far overcome the\r\nuneasiness of their spirits, in the remembrance of the disasters that\r\nhave happened, as to sit under his ministry, we advise the church, with\r\nall tenderness, to grant them a dismission unto any other society of\r\nthe faithful whereunto they may desire to be dismissed (Gal. vi. 1, 2;\r\nPs. ciii. 13, 14; Job xix. 21).\r\n\r\nIV. Mr. Parris having, as we understand, with much fidelity and\r\nintegrity acquitted himself in the main course of his ministry since he\r\nhath been pastor to the church in Salem Village, about his first call\r\nwhereunto, we look upon all contestations now to be both unreasonable\r\nand unseasonable; and our Lord having made him a blessing unto the\r\nsouls of not a few, both old and young, in this place, we advise that\r\nhe be accordingly respected, honored, and supported, with all the\r\nregards that are due to a painful minister of the gospel (1 Thess. v.\r\n12, 13; 1 Tim. v. 17).\r\n\r\nV. Having observed that there is in Salem Village a spirit full of\r\ncontentions and animosities, too sadly verifying the blemish which hath\r\nheretofore lain upon them, and that some complaints brought against Mr.\r\nParris have been either causeless and groundless, or unduly aggravated,\r\nwe do, in the name and fear of the Lord, solemnly warn them to\r\nconsider, whether, if they continue to devour one another, it will not\r\nbe bitterness in the latter end; and beware lest the Lord be provoked\r\nthereby utterly to deprive them of those which they should account\r\ntheir precious and pleasant things, and abandon them to all the\r\ndesolations of a people that sin away the mercies of the gospel (James\r\niii. 16; Gal. v. 15; 2 Sam. ii. 26; Isa. v. 4, 5, 6; Matt. xxi. 43).\r\n\r\nVI. If the distempers in Salem Village should be (which God forbid!) so\r\nincurable, that Mr. Parris, after all, find that he cannot, with any\r\ncomfort[ii.553] and service, continue in his present station, his\r\nremoval from thence will not expose him unto any hard character with\r\nus, nor, we hope, with the rest of the people of God among whom we live\r\n(Matt. x. 14; Acts xxii. 18).\r\n\r\nAll which advice we follow with our prayers that the God of peace would\r\nbruise Satan under our feet. Now, the Lord of peace himself give you\r\npeace always by all means.\r\n\r\nIncrease Mather, _Moderator_.\r\n\r\n*Joseph Bridgham.     *Ephraim Hunt. *Samuel Checkley.     *Nathll.\r\nWilliams. *William Torrey.

Samuel Checkley, a citizen of\r\nBoston, of much prominence at the time.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing document is skilfully drawn. While kindly in its tone\r\ntowards Mr. Parris, it is, in reality, a strong condemnation of his\r\ncourse, especially in Article I., as also in the paragraph marked\r\n(_a_), (p. 549), \"added by the desire of the Council\" to his\r\n\"Meditations for Peace.\" Article III. discountenances the proceedings\r\nof his church in its censure of \"the dissatisfied brethren,\" and\r\nrequires that they should be recognized and treated as members in good\r\nstanding. The fifth article administers rebuke with an equal hand to\r\nboth sides, while the sixth and last recommends the removal of Mr.\r\nParris, if the alienation of his opponents should prove \"incurable.\"\r\n\r\nAs an authoritative condemnation of the proceedings related in this\r\nwork, pronounced at the time, it is a fitting final close of the\r\npresentation of this subject.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[A] The double negative, as often used, merely intensified the\r\nnegation. See \"Measure for Measure,\" act i. scene 1.\r\n\r\n[B] In the innumerable depositions written by Thomas Putnam, he is not\r\nso careful to be correct, in his chirography and construction, as in\r\nhis parish-records. But, if the reader is inclined to make the\r\nexperiment, he will find, that, if the above document should be\r\nproperly pointed and spelled, according to our fashion at the present\r\nday, it would read well, and is clearly and forcibly put together.\r\nSpelling, at that time, was phonetic, and it enables us to ascertain\r\nthe then prevalent pronunciation of words. \"Corsely,\" no doubt, shows\r\nhow the word was then spoken. \"Angury\" was, with a large class of words\r\nnow dissyllables, then a trisyllable. \"Tould,\" \"spaking,\" and many\r\nother words above, are spelled just as they were then pronounced.\r\n\"Wicthcraft\" is always, I believe, spelled this way by Thomas Putnam.\r\nHe had not got rid of the old Anglo-Saxon sound of the word \"witch,\"\r\nbrought by his father from Buckinghamshire, sixty years\r\nbefore,—\"wicca.\"\r\nThe condition of medical science and practice, at that period, is\r\ncuriously illustrated in this paper. It is plain that the distemper of\r\nJames Carr was purely in the realm of the sensibilities and fancy; and\r\n\"doctor Crosbe\" is not wholly to blame because his \"visek\" did not\r\n\"work.\" A good smart nightmare, with a feeling that he had given a\r\nthorough basting to the spectre, in the form of a cat, of the supposed\r\nauthor of his woful and aggravated disappointment in love, was what he\r\nneeded; and it cured him. \"A posset of sack\" was Falstaff's refuge,\r\nfrom the plight into which he had been led by \"building upon a foolish\r\nwoman's promise,\" when he emerged from the Thames and the\r\n\"buck-basket.\" Many others, no doubt, in drowning sorrow and\r\nmortification, have found it \"the sovereignest thing on earth.\" But, as\r\nadministered by physicians of the Dr. Crosby school, with tobacco\r\nsteeped in it, it must have been a \"villanous compound.\"\r\n\r\n[C] A few days before her trial, Rebecca Nurse was subjected to this\r\ninspection and exploration; and the jury of women found the witch-mark\r\nupon her. On the 28th of June, two days before the meeting of the\r\nCourt, she addressed to that body the following communication:—\r\n\"_To the Honored Court of Oyer and Terminer, now sitting in Salem, this\r\n28th of June, Anno 1692._\r\n\"The humble petition of Rebecca Nurse, of Salem Village, humbly\r\nshoweth: That whereas some women did search your petitioner at Salem,\r\nas I did then conceive for some supernatural mark; and then one of the\r\nsaid women, which is known to be the most ancient, skilful, prudent\r\nperson of them all as to any such concern, did express herself to be of\r\na contrary opinion from the rest, and did then declare that she saw\r\nnothing in or about Your Honor's poor petitioner but what might arise\r\nfrom a natural cause,—I there rendered the said persons a sufficient\r\nknown reason as to myself of the moving cause thereof, which was by\r\nexceeding weaknesses, descending partly from an overture of nature, and\r\ndifficult exigencies that hath befallen me in the times of my travails.\r\nAnd therefore your petitioner humbly prays that Your Honors would be\r\npleased to admit of some other women to inquire into this great\r\nconcern, those that are most grave, wise, and skilful; namely, Mrs.\r\nHigginson, Sr., Mrs. Buxton, Mrs. Woodbury,—two of them being midwives,\r\nMrs. Porter, together with such others as may be chosen on that\r\naccount, before I am brought to my trial. All which I hope your honors\r\nwill take into your prudent consideration, and find it requisite so to\r\ndo; for my life lies now in your hands, under God. And, being conscious\r\nof my own innocency, I humbly beg that I may have liberty to manifest\r\nit to the world partly by the means abovesaid.\r\n\"And your poor petitioner shall evermore pray, as in duty bound, &c.\"\r\n\r\nHer daughters—Rebecca, wife of Thomas Preston; and Mary, wife of John\r\nTarbell—presented the following statement:—\r\n\"We whose names are underwritten—can testify, if called to it, that\r\nGoody Nurse hath been troubled with an infirmity of body for many\r\nyears, which the jury of women seem to be afraid it should be something\r\nelse.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no intimation, in any of the papers, that the petition of the\r\nmother or the deposition of her daughters received the least attention\r\nfrom the Court.\r\n\r\n[D] On the 19th of October, 1692, Thomas Hart, of Lynn, presented a\r\nmemorial to the General Court, stating that his mother, Elizabeth Hart,\r\nhad then been in Boston jail for nearly six months: \"Though, in all\r\nthis time, nothing has appeared against her whereby to render her\r\ndeserving of imprisonment or death, ... being ancient, and not able to\r\nundergo the hardship that is inflicted from lying in misery, and death\r\nrather to be chosen than a life in her circumstances.\" He says, that\r\nhis father is \"ancient and decrepit, and wholly unable\" to take any\r\nsteps in her behalf; that he feels \"obliged by all Christian duty, as\r\nbecomes a child to parents,\" to lay her case before the General Court.\r\n\"The petitioner having lived from his childhood under the same roof\r\nwith his mother, he dare presume to affirm that he never saw nor knew\r\nany evil or sinful practice wherein there was any show of impiety nor\r\nwitchcraft by her; and, were it otherwise, he would not, for the world\r\nand all the enjoyments thereof, nourish or support any creature that he\r\nknew engaged in the drudgery of Satan. It is well known to all the\r\nneighborhood, that the petitioner's mother has lived a sober and godly\r\nlife, always ready to discharge the part of a good Christian, and never\r\ndeserving of afflictions from the hands of men for any thing of this\r\nnature.\" He humbly prays \"for the speedy enlargement of this person so\r\nmuch abused.\" I present two more petitions. They help to fill up the\r\npicture of the sufferings and hardships borne by individuals and\r\nfamilies.\r\n\"_To the Honored General Court now sitting in Boston, the Humble\r\nPetition of Nicholas Rist, of Reading, showeth_, that whereas Sara\r\nRist, wife of the petitioner, was taken into custody the first day of\r\nJune last, and, ever since lain in Boston jail for witchcraft; though,\r\nin all this time, nothing has been made appear for which she deserved\r\nimprisonment or death: the petitioner has been a husband to the said\r\nwoman above twenty years, in all which time he never had reason to\r\naccuse her for any impiety or witchcraft, but the contrary. She lived\r\nwith him as a good, faithful, dutiful wife, and always had respect to\r\nthe ordinances of God while her strength remained; and the petitioner,\r\non that consideration, is obliged in conscience and justice to use all\r\nlawful means for the support and preservation of her life; and it is\r\ndeplorable, that, in old age, the poor decrepit woman should lie under\r\nconfinement so long in a stinking jail, when her circumstances rather\r\nrequire a nurse to attend her.\r\n\"May it, therefore, please Your Honors to take this matter into your\r\nprudent consideration, and direct some speedy methods whereby this\r\nancient decrepit person may not for ever lie in such misery, wherein\r\nher life is made more afflictive to her than death.\"\r\n\"_The Humble Petition of Thomas Barrett, of Chelmsford, in New England,\r\nin behalf of his daughter Martha Sparkes, wife of Henry Sparkes, who is\r\nnow a soldier in Their Majesties' Service at the Eastern Parts, and so\r\nhath been for a considerable time, humbly showeth_, That your\r\npetitioner's daughter hath lain in prison in Boston for the space of\r\ntwelve months and five days, being committed by Thomas Danforth, Esq.,\r\nthe late deputy-governor, upon suspicion of witchcraft; since which no\r\nevidence hath appeared against her in any such matter, neither hath any\r\ngiven bond to prosecute her, nor doth any one at this day accuse her of\r\nany such thing, as your petitioner knows of. That your petitioner hath\r\never since kept two of her children; the one of five years, the other\r\nof two years old, which hath been a considerable trouble and charge to\r\nhim in his poor and mean condition: besides, your petitioner hath a\r\nlame, ancient, and sick wife, who, for these five years and upwards\r\npast, hath been so afflicted as that she is altogether rendered\r\nuncapable of affording herself any help, which much augments his\r\ntrouble. Your poor petitioner earnestly and humbly entreats Your\r\nExcellency and Honors to take his distressed condition into your\r\nconsideration; and that you will please to order the releasement of his\r\ndaughter from her confinement, whereby she may return home to her poor\r\nchildren to look after them, having nothing to pay the charge of her\r\nconfinement.\r\n\"And your petitioner, as in duty bound, shall ever pray.\r\n\"Nov. 1, 1692.\"\r\n\r\n[E] I know nothing more artful and jesuitical than his attempts to\r\navoid the reproach of having been active in carrying on the delusion in\r\nSalem and elsewhere, and, at the same time, to keep up such a degree of\r\ncredulity and superstition in the minds of the people as to render it\r\neasy to plunge them into it again at the first favorable moment. In the\r\nfollowing passages, he endeavors to escape the odium that had been\r\nconnected with the prosecutions:—\r\n\"The world knows how many pages I have composed and published, and\r\nparticular gentlemen in the government know how many letters I have\r\nwritten, to prevent the excessive credit of spectral accusations.\r\n\"In short, I do humbly but freely affirm it, that there is not a man\r\nliving in this world, who has been more desirous than the poor man I to\r\nshelter my neighbors from the inconveniences of spectral outcries: yea,\r\nI am very jealous I have done so much that way as to sin in what I have\r\ndone; such have been the cowardice and fearfulness whereunto my regard\r\nunto the dissatisfaction of other people has precipitated me. I know a\r\nman in the world, who has thought he has been able to convict some such\r\nwitches as ought to die; but his respect unto the public peace has\r\ncaused him rather to try whether he could not renew them by\r\nrepentance.\"\r\nIn his Life of Sir William Phips, he endeavors to take the credit to\r\nhimself of having doubted the propriety of the proceedings while they\r\nwere in progress. This work was published without his name, in order\r\nthat he might commend himself with more freedom. The advice given by\r\nthe ministers of Boston and the vicinity to the government has been\r\nspoken of. Cotton Mather frequently took occasion to applaud and\r\nmagnify the merit of this production. In one of his writings, he speaks\r\nof \"the gracious words\" it contained. In his Life of Phips, he thus\r\nmodestly takes the credit of its authorship to himself: it was \"drawn\r\nup, at their (the ministers') desire, by Mr. Mather the younger, as I\r\nhave been informed.\" And, in order the more effectually to give the\r\nimpression that he was rather opposed to the proceedings, he quotes\r\nthose portions of the paper which recommended caution and\r\ncircumspection, leaving out those other passages in which it was\r\nvehemently urged to carry the proceedings on \"speedily and vigorously.\"\r\nThis single circumstance is decisive of the disingenuity of Dr. Mather.\r\nAs it was the purpose of the government, in requesting the advice of\r\nthe ministers, to ascertain their opinion of the expediency of\r\ncontinuing the prosecutions, it was a complete and deliberate\r\nperversion and falsification of their answer to omit the passages which\r\nencouraged the proceedings, and to record those only which recommended\r\ncaution and circumspection. The object of Mather in suppressing the\r\nimportant parts of the document has, however, in some measure been\r\nanswered. As the \"Magnalia,\" within which his Life of Phips is\r\nembraced, is the usual and popular source of information and reference\r\nrespecting the topics of which it treats, the opinion has prevailed,\r\nthat the Boston ministers, especially \"Mr. Mather the younger,\"\r\nendeavored to prevent the transactions connected with the trial and\r\nexecution of the supposed witches. Unfortunately, however, for the\r\nreputation of Cotton Mather, Hutchinson has preserved the address of\r\nthe ministers entire: and it appears that they approved, applauded, and\r\nstimulated the prosecutions; and that the people of Salem and the\r\nsurrounding country were the victims of a delusion, the principal\r\npromoters of which have, to a great degree, been sheltered from\r\nreproach by the dishonest artifice, which has now been exposed.\r\nBut, like other ambitious and grasping politicians, he was anxious to\r\nhave the support of all parties at the same time. After making court to\r\nthose who were dissatisfied with the prosecutions, he thus commends\r\nhimself to all who approved of them:—\r\n\"And why, after all my unwearied cares and pains to rescue the\r\nmiserable from the lions and bears of hell which had seized them, and\r\nafter all my studies to disappoint the devils in their designs to\r\nconfound my neighborhood, must I be driven to the necessity of an\r\napology? Truly, the hard representations wherewith some ill men have\r\nreviled my conduct, and the countenance which other men have given to\r\nthese representations, oblige me to give mankind some account of my\r\nbehavior. No Christian can (I say none but evil-workers can) criminate\r\nmy visiting such of my poor flock as have at any time fallen under the\r\nterrible and sensible molestations of evil angels. Let their\r\nafflictions have been what they will, I could not have answered it unto\r\nmy glorious Lord, if I had withheld my just comforts and counsels from\r\nthem; and, if I have also, with some exactness, observed the methods of\r\nthe invisible world, when they have thus become observable, I have been\r\nbut a servant of mankind in doing so: yea, no less a person than the\r\nvenerable Baxter has more than once or twice, in the most public\r\nmanner, invited mankind to thank me for that service.\"\r\nIn other passages, he thus continues to stimulate and encourage the\r\nadvocates of the prosecutions:—\r\n\"Wherefore, instead of all apish shouts and jeers at histories which\r\nhave such undoubted confirmation as that no man that has breeding\r\nenough to regard the common laws of human society will offer to doubt\r\nof them, it becomes us rather to adore the goodness of God, who does\r\nnot permit such things every day to befall us all, as he sometimes did\r\npermit to befall some few of our miserable neighbors.\r\n\"And it is a very glorious thing that I have now to mention: The devils\r\nhave, with most horrid operations, broke in upon our neighborhood; and\r\nGod has at such a rate overruled all the fury and malice of those\r\ndevils, that all the afflicted have not only been delivered, but, I\r\nhope, also savingly brought home unto God; and the reputation of no one\r\ngood person in the world has been damaged, but, instead thereof, the\r\nsouls of many, especially of the rising generation, have been thereby\r\nawakened unto some acquaintance with religion. Our young people, who\r\nbelonged unto the praying-meetings, of both sexes, apart, would\r\nordinarily spend whole nights, by whole weeks together, in prayers and\r\npsalms upon these occasions, in which devotions the devils could get\r\nnothing but, like fools, a scourge for their own backs: and some scores\r\nof other young people, who were strangers to real piety, were now\r\nstruck with the lively demonstrations of hell evidently set forth\r\nbefore their eyes, when they saw persons cruelly frighted, wounded and\r\nstarved by devils, and scalded with burning brimstone, and yet so\r\npreserved in this tortured state, as that, at the end of one month's\r\nwretchedness, they were as able still to undergo another; so that, of\r\nthese also, it might now be said, 'Behold, they pray.' In the whole,\r\nthe Devil got just nothing, but God got praises, Christ got subjects,\r\nthe Holy Spirit got temples, the church got additions, and the souls of\r\nmen got everlasting benefits. I am not so vain as to say that any\r\nwisdom or virtue of mine did contribute unto this good order of things;\r\nbut I am so just as to say, I did not hinder this good.\"\r\nI cannot, indeed, resist the conviction, that, notwithstanding all his\r\nattempts to appear dissatisfied, after they had become unpopular, with\r\nthe occurrences in the Salem trials, he looked upon them with secret\r\npleasure, and would have been glad to have had them repeated in Boston.\r\n\r\n[F] The following is a statement of the loss inflicted upon the estate\r\nof George Jacobs, Sr. The property of the son was utterly destroyed.\r\n\"_An Account of what was seized and taken away from my Father's Estate,\r\nGeorge Jacobs, Sr., late of Salem, deceased, by Sheriff Corwin and his\r\nAssistants in the year 1692._\r\n\"When my said father was executed, and I was forced to fly out of the\r\ncountry, to my great damage and distress of my family, my wife and\r\ndaughter imprisoned,—viz., my wife eleven months, and my daughter seven\r\nmonths in prison,—it cost them twelve pounds money to the officers,\r\nbesides other charges.\r\n\r\nFive cows, fair large cattle, £3 per cow     £      15     00     0 Eight\r\nloads of English hay taken out of the\r\n        barn, 35_s_. per load\r\n        14\r\n        00\r\n        0 A parcel of apples that made 24 barrels cider\r\n          to halves; viz., 12 barrels cider, 8_s_. per barrel\r\n\r\n4\r\n          16\r\n          0 Sixty bushels of Indian corn, 2_s_. 6_d_. per bushel     \r\n               7     10     0 A mare           2     0     0 Two good feather\r\n          beds, and furniture, rugs,\r\n                blankets, sheets, bolsters and pillows\r\n                10\r\n                0\r\n                0 Two brass kettles, cost           6     0     0 Money,\r\n                12_s_.; a large gold thumb ring, 20_s_.     \r\n                     1     12     0 Five swine           3     15     0 A\r\n                quantity of pewter which I cannot exactly\r\n                        know the worth, perhaps\r\n                        3\r\n                        0\r\n                        0\r\n            — 67     — 13     — 0 Besides abundance of small things, meat\r\n            in the house,\r\n                            fowls, chairs, and other things took clear\r\n                            away     _\r\n                            above_\r\n                            12\r\n                            0\r\n                            0\r\n\r\n      — 79 ==     — 13 ==     — 0 ==\r\n\r\n\"George Jacobs.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Edward Bishop and his wife Sarah were arrested, household goods\r\nwhich were valued by the sheriff himself at ten pounds,—he refusing\r\nthat sum for their restitution,—six cows, twenty-four swine, forty-six\r\nsheep, were taken from his farm. The imprisonment of himself and wife\r\n(prior to their escape) aggregated thirty-seven weeks. Ten shillings a\r\nweek for board, and other charges and prison fees amounting to five\r\npounds, were assessed upon his estate, and taken by distraint. A family\r\nof twelve children was left without any to direct or care for them, and\r\nthe product of the farm for that year wholly cut off.\r\nThere were taken from the estate of Samuel Wardwell, who was executed,\r\nfive cows, a heifer and yearling, a horse, nine hogs, eight loads of\r\nhay, six acres of standing corn, and a set of carpenters' tools. From\r\nthe estate of Dorcas Hoar, a widow, there were taken two cows, an ox\r\nand mare, four pigs, bed, bed-curtains and bedding, and other household\r\nstuff.\r\nPersons apprehended were made to pay all charges of every kind for\r\ntheir maintenance, fuel, clothes, expenses of transportation from jail\r\nto jail, and inexorable court and prison fees. The usual fee to the\r\nclerk of the courts was £1. 17_s._ 5_d._, sometimes more; sometimes,\r\nalthough very rarely, a little less. He must have received a large\r\namount of money in the aggregate that year. The prisoners were charged\r\nfor every paper that was drawn up. If a reprieve was obtained, there\r\nwas a fee. When discharged, there was a fee. The expenses of the\r\nexecutions, even hangmen's fees, were levied on the families of the\r\nsufferers. Abraham Foster, whose mother died in prison, to get her body\r\nfor burial, had to pay £2. 10_s._\r\nWhen the value of money at that time is considered, and we bear in mind\r\nthat most of the persons apprehended were farmers, who have but little\r\ncash on hand, and that these charges were levied on their stock, crops,\r\nand furniture in their absence, and in the unrestrained exercise of\r\narbitrary will, by the sheriff or constables, we can judge how utterly\r\nruinous the operation must have been.\r\n\r\n[G] Love's Labour's Lost, act v., sc. 1.\r\n\r\n[H] There are several other depositions in these cases, that may\r\nperhaps be explained under the head of nightmare. The following are\r\nspecimens; that, for instance, of Robert Downer, of Salisbury, who\r\ntestifies and says,—\r\n\"That, several years ago, Susanna Martin, the then wife of George\r\nMartin, being brought to court for a witch, the said Downer, having\r\nsome words with her, this deponent, among other things, told her he\r\nbelieved that she was a witch, by what was said or witnessed against\r\nher; at which she, seeming not well affected, said that a, or some,\r\nshe-devil would fetch him away shortly, at which this deponent was not\r\nmuch moved; but at night, as he lay in his bed in his own house, alone,\r\nthere came at his window the likeness of a cat, and by and by came up\r\nto his bed, took fast hold of his throat, and lay hard upon him a\r\nconsiderable while, and was like to throttle him. At length, he minded\r\nwhat Susanna Martin threatened him with the day before. He strove what\r\nhe could, and said, 'Avoid, thou she-devil, in the name of the Father,\r\nand the Son, and the Holy Ghost!' and then it let him go, and jumped\r\ndown upon the floor, and went out at the window again.\"\r\n\r\nSusanna Martin, by the boldness and severity of her language, in\r\ndefending herself against the charge of witchcraft, had evidently, for\r\na long time, rendered herself an object of dread, and seems to have\r\ndisturbed the dreams of the superstitious throughout the neighborhood.\r\nFor instance, Jarvis Ring, of Salisbury, made oath as follows:—\r\n\"That, about seven or eight years ago, he had been several times\r\nafflicted, in the night-time, by some body or some thing coming up upon\r\nhim when he was in bed, and did sorely afflict him by lying upon him;\r\nand he could neither move nor speak while it was upon him, but\r\nsometimes made a kind of noise that folks did hear him and come up to\r\nhim; and, as soon as anybody came, it would be gone. This it did for a\r\nlong time, both then and since, but he did never see anybody clearly;\r\nbut one time, in the night, it came upon me as at other times, and I\r\ndid then see the person of Susanna Martin, of Amesbury. I, this\r\ndeponent, did perfectly see her; and she came to this deponent, and\r\ntook him by the hand, and bit him by the finger by force, and then came\r\nand lay upon him awhile, as formerly, and after a while went away. The\r\nprint of the bite is yet to be seen on the little finger of his right\r\nhand; for it was hard to heal. He further saith, that several times he\r\nwas asleep when it came; but, at that time, he was as fairly awaked as\r\never he was, and plainly saw her shape, and felt her teeth, as\r\naforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nBarnard Peach made oath substantially as follows:—\r\n\"That about six or seven years past, being in bed on a Lord's-day\r\nnight, he heard a scrambling at the window, and saw Susanna Martin come\r\nin at the window, and jump down upon the floor. She was in her hood and\r\nscarf, and the same dress that she was in before, at meeting the same\r\nday. Being come in, she was coming up towards this deponent's face, but\r\nturned back to his feet, and took hold of them, and drew up his body\r\ninto a heap, and lay upon him about an hour and a half or two hours, in\r\nall which time this deponent could not stir nor speak; but, feeling\r\nhimself beginning to be loosened or lightened, and he beginning to\r\nstrive, he put out his hand among the clothes, and took hold of her\r\nhand, and brought it up to his mouth, and bit three of the fingers (as\r\nhe judges) to the breaking of the bones; which done, the said Martin\r\nwent out of the chamber, down the stairs, and out of the door. The\r\ndeponent further declared, that, on another Lord's-day night, while\r\nsleeping on the hay in a barn, about midnight the said Susanna Martin\r\nand another came out of the shop into the barn, and one of them said,\r\n'Here he is,' and then came towards this deponent. He, having a\r\nquarter-staff, made a blow at them; but the roof of the barn prevented\r\nit, and they went away: but this deponent followed them, and, as they\r\nwere going towards the window, made another blow at them, and struck\r\nthem both down; but away they went out at the shop-window, and this\r\ndeponent saw no more of them. And the rumor went, that the said Martin\r\nhad a broken head at that time; but the deponent cannot speak to that\r\nupon his own knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nAny one who has had the misfortune to be subject to nightmare will find\r\nthe elements of his own experience very much resembling the\r\ndescriptions given by Kembal, Downer, Ring, and Peach. The terrors to\r\nwhich superstition, credulity, and ignorance subjected their minds; the\r\nfrightful tales of witchcraft and apparitions to which they were\r\naccustomed to listen; and the contagious fears of the neighborhood in\r\nreference to Susanna Martin, taken in connection with a disordered\r\ndigestion, an overloaded stomach, and a hard bed, or a strange\r\nlodging-place,—are wholly sufficient to account for all the phenomena\r\nto which they testified.\r\n\r\n[I] The facts and considerations in reference to the authorship of the\r\nletter to Jonathan Corwin may be summarily stated as follows:—\r\nThe letter is signed \"R.P.\" Under these initials is written, \"Robert\r\nPain,\" in a different hand, and, as the ink as well as the chirography\r\nshows, at a somewhat later date. R.P. are blotted over, but with ink of\r\nsuch lighter hue that the original letters are clearly discernible\r\nunder it. A Robert Paine graduated at Harvard College, in 1656. But he\r\nwas probably the foreman of the grand jury that brought in all the\r\nindictments in the witchcraft trials; and therefore could not, from the\r\ndeclarations in the letter itself, have been its author. The only other\r\nperson of that name at the time, of whom we have knowledge, was his\r\nfather, who seems, by the evidence we have, to have died in 1693. (That\r\ndate is given in the Harvard Triennial for the death of Robert Paine,\r\nthe graduate; but erroneously, I think, as signatures to documents, and\r\nconveyances of property subsequently, can hardly be ascribed to any\r\nother person.) Robert Paine, the father, from the earliest settlement\r\nof Ipswich, had been one of the leading men of the town, apparently of\r\nlarger property than any other, often its deputy in the General Court,\r\nand, for a great length of time, ruling elder of the church. \"Elder\r\nPain,\" or Penn, as the name was often spelled, enjoyed the friendship\r\nof John Norton, and all the ministers far and near; and religious\r\nmeetings were often held at his house. We know nothing to justify us in\r\nsaying that he could not have been the author of this paper; but we\r\nalso know nothing, except the appearance of his name upon it, to impute\r\nit to him.\r\nThe document is dated from \"Salisbury.\" So far as we know, Elder Paine\r\nalways lived in Ipswich; although, having property in the upper county,\r\nhe may have often been, and possibly in his last years resided, there.\r\nIt is, it is true, a strong circumstance, that his name is written,\r\nalthough by a late hand, under the initials. It shows that the person\r\nwho wrote it thought that \"R.P.\" meant Robert Paine; but any one\r\nconversant especially with the antiquities of Ipswich, or this part of\r\nthe county, might naturally fall into such a mistake. The authorship of\r\ndocuments was often erroneously ascribed. The words \"Robert Pain\" were,\r\nprobably, not on the paper when the indorsement was made, \"A letter to\r\nmy grandfather,\" &c. Elder Robert Paine, if living in 1692, was\r\nninety-one years of age. The document under consideration, if composed\r\nby him, is truly a marvellous production,—an intellectual phenomenon\r\nnot easily to be paralleled.\r\nThe facts in reference to Robert Pike, of Salisbury, as they bear upon\r\nthe question of the authorship of the document, are these: He was\r\nseventy-six years of age in 1692, and had always resided in\r\n\"Salisbury.\" The letter and argument are both in the handwriting of\r\nCaptain Thomas Bradbury, Recorder of old Norfolk County. On this point,\r\nthere can be no question. Bradbury and Pike had been fellow-townsmen\r\nfor more than half a century, connected by all the ties of neighborhood\r\nand family intermarriage, and jointly or alternately had borne all the\r\ncivic and military honors the people could bestow. The document was\r\nprepared and delivered to the judge while Mrs. Bradbury was in prison,\r\nand just one month before her trial. Pike, as has been shown (p. 226),\r\nwas deeply interested in her behalf. The original signature (\"R.P.\")\r\nhas the marked characteristics of the same initial letters as found in\r\ninnumerable autographs of his, on file or record. There are\r\ninterlineations, beyond question in Pike's handwriting. These facts\r\ndemonstrate that both Pike and Bradbury were concerned in producing the\r\ndocument.\r\nThe history of Robert Pike proves that he was a man of great ability,\r\nhad a turn of mind towards logical exercises, and was, from early life,\r\nconversant with disputations. Nearly fifty years before, he argued in\r\ntown-meeting against the propriety, in view of civil and ecclesiastical\r\nlaw, of certain acts of the General Court. They arraigned,\r\ndisfranchised, and otherwise punished him for his \"litigiousness:\" but\r\nthe weight of his character soon compelled them to restore his\r\npolitical rights; and the people of Salisbury, the very next year, sent\r\nhim among them as their deputy, and continued him from time to time in\r\nthat capacity. At a subsequent period, he was the leader and spokesman\r\nof a party in a controversy about some ecclesiastical affairs,\r\ninvolving apparently certain nice questions of theology, which created\r\na great stir through the country. The contest reached so high a point,\r\nthat the church at Salisbury excommunicated him; but the public voice\r\ndemanded a council of churches, which assembled in September, 1676, and\r\nre-instated Major Pike condemning his excommunication, \"finding it not\r\njustifiable upon divers grounds.\" On this occasion, as before, the\r\nGeneral Court frowned upon and denounced him; but the people came again\r\nto his rescue, sending him at the next election into the House of\r\nDeputies, and kept him there until raised to the Upper House as an\r\nAssistant. He was in the practice of conducting causes in the courts,\r\nand was long a local magistrate and one of the county judges.\r\nHe does not appear to have been present at any of the trials or\r\nexaminations of 1692; but his official position as Assistant caused\r\nmany depositions taken in his neighborhood to be acknowledged and sworn\r\nbefore him. While entertaining the prevalent views about diabolical\r\nagency, he always disapproved of the proceedings of the Court in the\r\nparticulars to which the arguments of the communication to Jonathan\r\nCorwin apply,—the \"spectre evidence,\"—and the statements and actings of\r\n\"the afflicted children.\" There are indications that sometimes he saw\r\nthrough the folly of the stories told by persons whose depositions he\r\nwas called to attest. One John Pressy was circulating a wonderful tale\r\nabout an encounter he had with the spectre of Susanna Martin. Pike sent\r\nfor him, and took his deposition. Pressy averred, that, one evening,\r\ncoming from Amesbury Ferry, he fell in with the shape of Martin in the\r\nform of a body of light, which \"seemed to be about the bigness of a\r\nhalf-bushel.\" After much dodging and manœuvring, and being lost and\r\nbewildered, wandering to and fro, tumbling into holes,—where, as the\r\ndeposition states, no \"such pitts\" were known to exist,—and other\r\nmisadventures, he came to blows with the light, and had several brushes\r\nwith it, striking it with his stick. At one time, \"he thinks he gave\r\nher at least forty blows.\" He finally succeeded in finding \"his own\r\nhouse: but, being then seized with fear, could not speak till his wife\r\nspoke to him at the door, and was in such a condition that the family\r\nwas afraid of him; which story being carried to the town the next day,\r\nit was, upon inquiry, understood, that said Goodwife Martin was in such\r\na miserable case and in such pain that they swabbed her body, as was\r\nreported.\" He concludes his deposition by saying, that Major Pike\r\n\"seemed to be troubled that this deponent had not told him of it in\r\nseason that she might have been viewed to have seen what her ail was.\"\r\nThe affair had happened \"about twenty-four years ago.\" Probably neither\r\nPressy nor the Court appreciated the keenness of the major's expression\r\nof regret. It broke the bubble of the deposition. The whole story was\r\nthe product of a benighted imagination, disordered by fear, filled with\r\ninebriate vagaries, exaggerated in nightmare, and resting upon wild and\r\nempty rumors. Robert Pike's course, in the case of Mrs. Bradbury,\r\nharmonizes with the supposition that he was Corwin's correspondent.\r\nMaterials may be brought to light that will change the evidence on the\r\npoint. It may be found that Elder Paine died before 1692: that would\r\ndispose of the question. It may appear that he was living in Salisbury\r\nat the time, and acted with Pike and Bradbury, they giving to the paper\r\nthe authority of his venerable name and years. But all that is now\r\nknown, constrains me to the conclusion stated in the text.\r\n\r\n[J] As an illustration of the oblivion that had settled over the\r\ndetails of the transactions and characters connected with the\r\nwitchcraft prosecutions, it may be mentioned, that when, thirty-five\r\nyears ago, I prepared the work entitled 'Lectures on Witchcraft;\r\ncomprising a History of the Delusion in 1692,' although professional\r\nengagements prevented my making the elaborate exploration that has now\r\nbeen given to the subject, I extended the investigation over the\r\nordinary fields of research, and took particular pains to obtain\r\ninformation brought down by tradition, gleaned all that could be\r\ngathered from the memories of old persons then living of what they had\r\nheard from their predecessors, and sought for every thing that local\r\nantiquaries and genealogists could contribute. I find, by the methods\r\nof inquiry adopted in the preparation of the present work, how\r\ninadequate and meagre was the knowledge then possessed. Most of the\r\npersons accused and executed, like Giles Corey, his wife Martha, and\r\nBridget Bishop, were supposed to have been of humble, if not mean\r\ncondition, of vagrant habits, and more or less despicable repute. By\r\nfollowing the threads placed in my hands, in the files of the\r\ncounty-offices of Registry of Deeds and Wills, and documents connected\r\nwith trials at law, and by a collation of conveyances and the\r\nadministration of estates, I find that Corey, however eccentric or open\r\nto criticism in some features of character and passages of his life,\r\nwas a large landholder, and a man of singular force and acuteness of\r\nintellect; while his wife had an intelligence in advance of her times,\r\nand was a woman of eminent piety. The same is found to have been the\r\ncase with most of those who suffered.\r\nThe reader may judge of my surprise in now discovering, that, while\r\nwriting the \"Lectures on Witchcraft,\" I was owning and occupying a part\r\nof the estate of Bridget Bishop, if not actually living in her house.\r\nThe hard, impenetrable, all but petrified oak frame seems to argue that\r\nit dates back as far as when she rebuilt and renewed the original\r\nstructure. Little, however, did I suspect, while delivering those\r\nlectures in the Lyceum Hall, that we were assembled on the site of her\r\norchard, the scene of the preternatural and diabolical feats charged\r\nupon her by the testimony of Louder and others. Her estate was one of\r\nthe most eligible and valuable in the old town, with a front, as has\r\nbeen mentioned, of a hundred feet on Washington Street, and extending\r\nalong Church Street more than half the distance to St. Peter's Street.\r\nAt the same time, her husband seems to have had a house in the village,\r\nnear the head of Bass River. It is truly remarkable, that the locality\r\nof the property and residence of a person of her position, and who led\r\nthe way among the victims of such an awful tragedy, should have become\r\nwholly obliterated from memory and tradition, in a community of such\r\nintelligence, consisting, in so large a degree, of old families,\r\ntracing themselves back to the earliest generations, and among whom the\r\ninnumerable descendants of her seven great-grandchildren have continued\r\nto this day. It can only be accounted for by the considerations\r\nmentioned in the text. Tradition was stifled by horror and shame. What\r\nall desired to forget was forgotten. The only recourse was in oblivion;\r\nand all, sufferers and actors alike, found shelter under it.\r\n\r\n[K] The looseness and inaccuracy of persons in reference to their own\r\nages, in early times, is quite observable. In depositions, they speak\r\nof themselves as \"about\" so many years, or as of so many years \"or\r\nthereabouts.\" A variance on this point is often found in the statements\r\nof the same person at different times. Neither are records always to be\r\nrelied upon as to precision. In the record-book of the village church,\r\nMr. Parris enters the age of Mrs. Ann Putnam, at the date of her\r\nadmission, June 4, 1691, as \"Ann: ætat: 27.\" But an \"Account of the\r\nEarly Settlers of Salisbury,\" in the \"New-England Historical and\r\nGenealogical Register,\" vol. vii. p. 314, gives the date of her birth\r\n\"15, 4, 1661.\" Her age is stated above according to this last\r\nauthority; and, if correct, she was not so young, at the time of her\r\nmarriage, as intimated (vol. i. p. 253), but seventeen years five\r\nmonths and ten days. It is difficult, however, to conceive how Parris,\r\nwho was careful about such matters, and undoubtedly had his information\r\nfrom her own lips, could have been so far out of the way. Her brother,\r\nWilliam Carr, in 1692, deposed that he was then forty-one years of age\r\nor thereabouts; whereas, the \"Account of the Early Settlers of\r\nSalisbury,\" just referred to, gives the date of his birth \"15, 1,\r\n1648.\" It is indeed singular, that two members of a family of their\r\nstanding should have been under an error as to their own age; one to an\r\nextent of almost, the other of some months more than, three years.\r\n\r\n[L] The following passage is from the parish records:—\r\n\"On the 3d of February, 1693, a warrant was issued for a meeting of the\r\ninhabitants of the village, signed by Thomas Preston, Joseph Pope,\r\nJoseph Houlton, and John Tarbell, of the standing annual committee, to\r\nbe held Feb. 14, 'to consider and agree and determine who are capable\r\nof voting in our public transactions, by the power given us by the\r\nGeneral-court order at our first settlement; and to consider of and\r\nmake void a vote in our book of records, on the 18th of June, 1689,\r\nwhere there is a salary of sixty-six pounds stated to Mr. Parris, he\r\nnot complying with it; also to consider of and make void several votes\r\nin the book of records on the 10th of October, 1692, where our ministry\r\nhouse and barn and two acres of land seem to be conveyed from us after\r\na fraudulent manner.'\"\r\nAt this meeting, it was voted, that \"all men that are ratable, or\r\nhereafter shall be living within that tract of land mentioned in our\r\nGeneral-court order, shall have liberty in nominating and appointing a\r\ncommittee, and voting in any of our public concerns.\"\r\nBy referring to the account, in the First Part, of the controversy\r\nbetween the inhabitants of the village and Mr. Bayley, \"the power\"\r\nabove alluded to, \"given us by the General Court,\" will be seen fully\r\ndescribed. In its earnestness to fasten Mr. Bayley upon \"the\r\ninhabitants,\" the Court elaborately ordained the system by which they\r\nshould be constrained to provide for him, and compelled to raise the\r\nmeans of paying his salary. As no church had then been organized, the\r\nGeneral Court fastened the duty upon \"householders.\" The fact had not\r\nbeen forgotten, and the above vote showed that the parish intended to\r\nhold on to the power then given them. This highly incensed the Court of\r\nSessions. It ordered the parish book of records to be produced before\r\nit, and caused a condemnation of such a claim of right to be written\r\nout, in open Court, on the face of the record, where it is now to be\r\nseen. It is as follows:—\r\n\"At the General Sessions of the Peace holden at Ipswich, March the\r\n28th, 1693. This Court having viewed and considered the above agreement\r\nor vote contained in the last five lines, finding the same to be\r\nrepugnant to the laws of this province, do declare the same to be null\r\nand void, and that this order be recorded with the records of this\r\nCourt.\r\n\"Attest, Stephen Sewall, _Clerk_.\"",
