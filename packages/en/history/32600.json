PRESCOTT,\r\nCORRESPONDING MEMBER OF THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE, OF THE ROYAL\r\nACADEMY OF HISTORY AT MADRID, ETC.\r\n\r\nVOLUMES FIRST AND SECOND.\r\n\r\nCOMPLETE IN ONE VOLUME.\r\n\r\nLONDON\r\nGEORGE ROUTLEDGE AND SONS\r\nTHE BROADWAY, LUDGATE\r\nNEW YORK. 416, BROOME STREET.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reign of Philip the Second has occupied the pen of the historian\r\nmore frequently--if we except that of Charles the Fifth--than any other\r\nportion of the Spanish annals. It has become familiar to the English\r\nreader through the pages of Watson, who has deservedly found favor with\r\nthe public for the perspicuity of his style,--a virtue, however, not\r\nuncommon in his day,--for the sobriety of his judgments, and for the\r\nskill he has shown in arranging his complicated story, so as to maintain\r\nthe reader's interest unbroken to the end. But the public, in Watson's\r\nday, were not very fastidious in regard to the sources of the\r\ninformation on which a narrative was founded. Nor was it easy to obtain\r\naccess to those unpublished documents which constitute the best sources\r\nof information. Neither can it be denied that Watson himself was not so\r\nsolicitous as he should have been to profit by opportunities which a\r\nlittle pains might have put within his reach,--presenting, in this\r\nrespect, a contrast to his more celebrated predecessor, Robertson; that\r\nhe contented himself too easily with such cheap and commonplace\r\nmaterials as lay directly in his path; and that, consequently, the\r\nfoundations of his history are much too slight for the superstructure.\r\nFor these reasons, the reign of Philip the Second must still be regarded\r\nas open ground for English and American writers.\r\n\r\nAnd at no time could the history of this reign have been undertaken with\r\nthe same advantages as at present, when the more enlightened policy of\r\nthe European governments has opened their national archives to the\r\ninspection of the scholar; when he is allowed access, in particular, to\r\nthe Archives of Simancas, which have held the secrets of the Spanish\r\nmonarchy hermetically sealed for ages.\r\n\r\nThe history of Philip the Second is the history of Europe during the\r\nlatter half of the sixteenth century. It covers the period when the\r\ndoctrines of the Reformation were agitating the minds of men in so\r\nfearful a manner as to shake the very foundations of the Romish\r\nhierarchy in the fierce contest which divided Christendom. Philip, both\r\nfrom his personal character, and from his position as sovereign of the\r\nmost potent monarchy in Europe, was placed at the head of the party\r\nwhich strove to uphold the fortunes of the ancient Church; and thus his\r\npolicy led him perpetually to interfere in the internal affairs of the\r\nother European states,--making it necessary to look for the materials\r\nfor his history quite as much without the Peninsula as within it. In\r\nthis respect the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella presents a strong\r\ncontrast to that of Philip the Second; and it was the consideration of\r\nthis, when I had completed my history of the former, and proposed at\r\nsome future day to enter upon that of the latter, that led me to set\r\nabout a collection of authentic materials from the public archives in\r\nthe great European capitals. It was a work of difficulty; and, although\r\nI had made some progress in it, I did not feel assured of success until\r\nI had the good fortune to obtain the coöperation of my friend, Don\r\nPascual de Gayangos, Professor of Arabic in the University of Madrid.\r\nThis eminent scholar was admirably qualified for the task which he so\r\nkindly undertook; since, with a remarkable facility--such as long\r\npractice only can give--in deciphering the mysterious handwriting of the\r\nsixteenth century, he combined such a thorough acquaintance with the\r\nhistory of his country as enabled him to detect, amidst the ocean of\r\nmanuscripts which he inspected, such portions as were essential to my\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nWith unwearied assiduity he devoted himself to the examination of many\r\nof the principal collections, both in England and on the Continent.\r\nAmong these may be mentioned the British Museum and the State-Paper\r\nOffice, in London; the Library of the Dukes of Burgundy, in Brussels;\r\nthat of the University of Leyden; the Royal Library, at the Hague; the\r\nRoyal Library of Paris, and the Archives of the Kingdom, in the Hôtel\r\nSoubise; the Library of the Academy of History, the National Library at\r\nMadrid, and, more important than either, the ancient Archives of\r\nSimancas, within whose hallowed precincts Señor Gayangos was one of the\r\nfirst scholars permitted to enter.\r\n\r\nBesides these public repositories, there are several private collections\r\nto the owners of which I am largely indebted for the liberal manner in\r\nwhich they have opened them for my benefit. I may mention, in\r\nparticular, the late Lady Holland, who kindly permitted copies to be\r\nmade by Señor Gayangos from the manuscripts preserved in Holland House;\r\nSir Thomas Phillips, Bart., who freely extended the same courtesy in\r\nrespect to the present work which he had shown to me on a former\r\noccasion; and Patrick Fraser Tytler, Esq., the late excellent historian\r\nof Scotland, who generously placed at my disposal sundry documents\r\ncopied by him in the public offices with his own hand, for the\r\nillustration of the reign of Mary Tudor.\r\n\r\nIn Spain the collection made by Señor Gayangos was enriched by materials\r\ndrawn from the family archives of the marquis of Santa Cruz, whose\r\nillustrious ancestor first had charge of the Spanish armada; from the\r\narchives of Medina Sidonia, containing papers of the duke who succeeded\r\nto the command of that ill-starred expedition; and from the archives of\r\nthe house of Alva,--a name associated with the most memorable acts of\r\nthe government of Philip.\r\n\r\nThe manuscripts, thus drawn from various quarters, were fortified by\r\nsuch printed works as, having made their appearance in the time of\r\nPhilip the Second, could throw any light on his government. Where such\r\nworks were not to be purchased, Señor Gayangos caused copies to be made\r\nof them, or of those portions which were important to my purpose. The\r\nresult of his kind, untiring labors has been to put me in possession of\r\nsuch a collection of authentic materials for the illustration of the\r\nreign of Philip as no one before had probably attempted to make. Nor\r\nuntil now had the time come for making the attempt with success.\r\n\r\nThere still remained, however, some places to be examined where I might\r\nexpect to find documents that would be of use to me. Indeed, it is in\r\nthe nature of such a collection, covering so wide an extent of ground,\r\nthat it can never be complete. The historian may be satisfied, if he has\r\nsuch authentic materials at his command, as, while they solve much that\r\nhas hitherto been enigmatical in the accounts of the time, will enable\r\nhim to present, in their true light, the character of Philip and the\r\npolicy of his government. I must acknowledge my obligations to more than\r\none person, who has given me important aid in prosecuting my further\r\nresearches.\r\n\r\nOne of the first of them is my friend, Mr. Edward Everett, who, in his\r\nlong and brilliant career as a statesman, has lost nothing of that love\r\nof letters which formed his first claim to distinction. The year before\r\nhis appointment to the English mission he passed on the Continent,\r\nwhere, with the kindness that belongs to his nature, he spent much time\r\nin examining for me the great libraries, first in Paris, and afterwards\r\nmore effectually in Florence. From the _Archivio Mediceo_, in which he\r\nwas permitted by the grand duke to conduct his researches, he obtained\r\ncopies of sundry valuable documents, and among them the letters of the\r\nTuscan ministers, which have helped to guide me in some of the most\r\nintricate parts of my narrative. A still larger amount of materials he\r\nderived from the private library of Count Guicciardini, the descendant\r\nof the illustrious historian of that name. I am happy to express my\r\nlively sense of the courtesy shown by this nobleman; also my gratitude\r\nfor kind offices rendered me by Prince Corsini; and no less by the\r\nMarquis Gino Capponi, whose name will be always held in honor for the\r\nenlightened patronage which he has extended to learning, while\r\nsuffering, himself, under the severest privation that can befall the\r\nscholar.\r\n\r\nThere was still an important deficiency in my collection,--that of the\r\n_Relazioni Venete_, as the reports are called which were made by\r\nambassadors of Venice on their return from their foreign missions. The\r\nvalue of these reports, for the information they give of the countries\r\nvisited by the envoys, is well known to historians. The deficiency was\r\namply supplied by the unwearied kindness of my friend, Mr. Fay, who now\r\nso ably fills the post of minister from the United States to\r\nSwitzerland. When connected with the American legation at Berlin, he, in\r\nthe most obliging manner, assisted me in making arrangements for\r\nobtaining the documents I desired, which, with other papers of\r\nimportance, were copied for me from the manuscripts in the Royal Library\r\nof Berlin, and the Ducal Library of Gotha. I have also, in connection\r\nwith this, to express my obligations to the distinguished librarian of\r\nthe former institution, Mr. Pertz, for the good-will which he showed in\r\npromoting my views.\r\n\r\nThrough Mr. Fay, I also obtained the authority of Prince Metternich to\r\ninspect the Archives of the Empire in Vienna, which I inferred, from the\r\nintimate relations subsisting between the courts of Madrid and Vienna in\r\nthat day, must contain much valuable matter relevant to my subject. The\r\nresult did not correspond to my expectations. I am happy, however, to\r\nhave the opportunity of publicly offering my acknowledgments to that\r\neminent scholar, Dr. Ferdinand Wolf, for the obliging manner in which he\r\nconducted the investigation for me, as well in the archives above\r\nmentioned, as, with better results, in the Imperial Library, with which\r\nhe is officially connected.\r\n\r\nIn concluding the list of those to whose good offices I have been\r\nindebted, I must not omit the names of M. de Salvandy, minister of\r\npublic instruction in France at the time I was engaged in making my\r\ncollection; Mr. Rush, then the minister of the United States at the\r\nFrench court; Mr. Rives, of Virginia, his successor in that office; and\r\nlast, not least, my friend, Count de Circourt, a scholar whose noble\r\ncontributions to the periodical literature of his country, on the\r\ngreatest variety of topics, have given him a prominent place among the\r\nwriters of our time.\r\n\r\nI am happy, also, to tender my acknowledgments for the favors I have\r\nreceived from Mr. Van de Weyer, minister from Belgium to the court of\r\nSt. James; from Mr. B. Homer Dixon, consul for the Netherlands at\r\nBoston; and from my friend and kinsman, Mr. Thomas Hickling, consul for\r\nthe United States at St. Michael's, who kindly furnished me with sundry\r\nmanuscripts exhibiting the condition of the Azores at the period when\r\nthose islands passed, with Portugal, under the sceptre of Philip the\r\nSecond.\r\n\r\nHaving thus acquainted the reader with the sources whence I have derived\r\nmy materials, I must now say a few words in regard to the conduct of my\r\nnarrative. An obvious difficulty in the path of the historian of this\r\nperiod arises from the nature of the subject, embracing, as it does,\r\nsuch a variety of independent, not to say incongruous topics, that it is\r\nno easy matter to preserve anything like unity of interest in the story.\r\nThus the Revolution of the Netherlands, although, strictly speaking,\r\nonly an episode to the main body of the narrative, from its importance,\r\nwell deserves to be treated in a separate and independent narrative by\r\nitself.[1] Running along through the whole extent of Philip's reign, it\r\nis continually distracting the attention of the historian, creating an\r\nembarrassment something like that which arises from what is termed a\r\ndouble plot in the drama. The best way of obviating this is to keep in\r\nview the dominant principle which controlled all the movements of the\r\ncomplicated machinery, so to speak, and impressed on them a unity of\r\naction. This principle is to be found in the policy of Philip, the great\r\naim of which was to uphold the supremacy of the Church, and, as a\r\nconsequence, that of the crown. \"Peace and public order,\" he writes on\r\none occasion, \"are to be maintained in my dominions only by maintaining\r\nthe authority of the Holy See.\" It was this policy, almost as sure and\r\nsteady in its operation as the laws of Nature herself, that may be said\r\nto have directed the march of events through the whole of his long\r\nreign; and it is only by keeping this constantly in view that the\r\nstudent will be enabled to obtain a clew to guide him through the\r\nintricate passages in the history of Philip, and the best means of\r\nsolving what would otherwise remain enigmatical in his conduct.\r\n\r\nIn the composition of the work, I have, for the most part, conformed to\r\nthe plan which I had before adopted. Far from confining myself to a\r\nrecord of political events, I have endeavored to present a picture of\r\nthe intellectual culture and the manners of the people. I have not even\r\nrefused such aid as could be obtained from the display of pageants, and\r\ncourt ceremonies, which, although exhibiting little more than the\r\ncostume of the time, may serve to bring the outward form of a\r\npicturesque age more vividly before the eye of the reader. In the\r\narrangement of the narrative, I have not confined myself altogether to\r\nthe chronological order of events, but have thrown them into masses,\r\naccording to the subjects to which they relate, so as to produce, as far\r\nas possible, a distinct impression on the reader. And in this way I have\r\npostponed more than one matter of importance to a later portion of the\r\nwork, which a strict regard to time would assign more properly to an\r\nearlier division of the subject. Finally, I have been careful to fortify\r\nthe text with citations from the original authorities on which it\r\ndepends, especially where these are rare and difficult of access.\r\n\r\nIn the part relating to the Netherlands I have pursued a course somewhat\r\ndifferent from what I have done in other parts of the work. The scholars\r\nof that country, in a truly patriotic spirit, have devoted themselves of\r\nlate years to exploring their own archives, as well as those of\r\nSimancas, for the purpose of illustrating their national annals. The\r\nresults they have given to the world in a series of publications, which\r\nare still in progress. The historian has reason to be deeply grateful to\r\nthose pioneers, whose labors have put him in possession of materials\r\nwhich afford the most substantial basis for his narrative. For what\r\nbasis can compare with that afforded by the written correspondence of\r\nthe parties themselves? It is on this sure ground that I have mainly\r\nrelied in this part of my story; and I have adopted the practice of\r\nincorporating extracts from the letters in the body of the text, which,\r\nif it may sometimes give an air of prolixity to the narrative, will have\r\nthe advantage of bringing the reader into a sort of personal\r\nacquaintance with the actors, as he listens to the words spoken by\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier part of this Preface, I have made the acknowledgments due\r\nfor assistance I have received in the collection of my materials; and I\r\nmust not now conclude without recording my obligations, of another kind,\r\nto two of my personal friends,--Mr. Charles Folsom, the learned\r\nlibrarian of the Boston Athenæum, who has repeated the good offices he\r\nhad before rendered me in revising my manuscript for the press; and Mr.\r\nJohn Foster Kirk, whose familiarity with the history and languages of\r\nModern Europe has greatly aided me in the prosecution of my researches,\r\nwhile his sagacious criticism has done me no less service in the\r\npreparation of these volumes.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the advantages I have enjoyed for the composition of\r\nthis work, and especially those derived from the possession of new and\r\noriginal materials, I am fully sensible that I am far from having done\r\njustice to a subject so vast in its extent and so complicated in its\r\nrelations. It is not necessary to urge in my defence any physical\r\nembarrassments under which I labor; since that will hardly be an excuse\r\nfor not doing well what it was not necessary to do at all. But I may be\r\npermitted to say, that what I have done has been the result of careful\r\npreparation; that I have endeavored to write in a spirit of candor and\r\ngood faith; and that, whatever may be the deficiencies of my work, it\r\ncan hardly fail--considering the advantages I have enjoyed over my\r\npredecessors--to present the reader with such new and authentic\r\nstatements of facts as may afford him a better point of view than that\r\nwhich he has hitherto possessed for surveying the history of Philip the\r\nSecond.\r\n\r\nBOSTON, _July,

I now propose to examine a later\r\nperiod in the history of the same nation,--the reign of Philip the\r\nSecond; when, with resources greatly enlarged, and territory extended by\r\na brilliant career of discovery and conquest, it had risen to the zenith\r\nof its power; but when, under the mischievous policy of the\r\nadministration, it had excited the jealousy of its neighbors, and\r\nalready disclosed those germs of domestic corruption which gradually led\r\nto its dismemberment and decay.\r\n\r\nBy the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella, most of the states of the\r\nPeninsula became united under one common rule; and in 1516, the sceptre\r\nof Spain, with its dependencies both in the Old and the New World,\r\npassed into the hands of their grandson, Charles the Fifth, who, though\r\nhe shared the throne nominally with his mother, Joanna, became, in\r\nconsequence of her incapacity, the real sovereign of this vast empire.\r\nHe had before inherited, through his father, Philip the Handsome, that\r\nfair portion of the ducal realm of Burgundy which comprehended Franche\r\nComté and the Netherlands. In 1519, he was elected to the imperial crown\r\nof Germany. Not many years elapsed before his domain was still further\r\nenlarged by the barbaric empires of Mexico and Peru; and Spain then\r\nfirst realized the magnificent vaunt, since so often repeated, that the\r\nsun never set within the borders of her dominions.\r\n\r\nYet the importance of Spain did not rise with the importance of her\r\nacquisitions. She was, in a manner, lost in the magnitude of these\r\nacquisitions. Some of the rival nations which owned the sway of Charles,\r\nin Europe, were of much greater importance than Spain, and attracted\r\nmuch more attention from their contemporaries. In the earlier period of\r\nthat monarch's reign, there was a moment when a contest was going\r\nforward in Castile, of the deepest interest to mankind. Unfortunately,\r\nthe \"War of the _Comunidades_,\" as it was termed, was soon closed by\r\nthe ruin of the patriots; and, on the memorable field of Villalar, the\r\nliberties of Spain received a blow from which they were destined not to\r\nrecover for centuries. From that fatal hour,--the bitter fruit of the\r\njealousy of castes and the passions of the populace,--an unbroken\r\ntranquillity reigned throughout the country; such a tranquillity as\r\nnaturally flows not from a free and well-conducted government, but from\r\na despotic one. In this political tranquillity, however, the intellect\r\nof Spain did not slumber. Sheltered from invasion by the barrier of the\r\nPyrenees, her people were allowed to cultivate the arts of peace, so\r\nlong as they did not meddle with politics or religion,--in other words,\r\nwith the great interests of humanity; while the more adventurous found a\r\nscope for their prowess in European wars, or in exploring the boundless\r\nregions of the Western world.\r\n\r\nWhile there was so little passing in Spain to attract the eye of the\r\nhistorian, Germany became the theatre of one of those momentous\r\nstruggles which have had a permanent influence on the destinies of\r\nmankind. It was in this reign that the great battle of religious liberty\r\nwas begun; and the attention and personal presence of Charles were\r\nnecessarily demanded most in the country where that battle was to be\r\nfought. But a small part of his life was passed in Spain, in comparison\r\nwith what he spent in other parts of his dominions. His early\r\nattachments, his lasting sympathies, were with the people of the\r\nNetherlands; for Flanders was the place of his birth. He spoke the\r\nlanguage of that country more fluently than the Castilian; although he\r\nknew the various languages of his dominions so well, that he could\r\naddress his subjects from every quarter in their native dialect. In the\r\nsame manner, he could accommodate himself to their peculiar national\r\nmanners and tastes. But this flexibility was foreign to the genius of\r\nthe Spaniard. Charles brought nothing from Spain but a religious zeal,\r\namounting to bigotry, which took deep root in a melancholy temperament\r\ninherited from his mother. His tastes were all Flemish. He introduced\r\nthe gorgeous ceremonial of the Burgundian court into his own palace, and\r\ninto the household of his son. He drew his most trusted and familiar\r\ncounsellors from Flanders; and this was one great cause of the troubles\r\nwhich, at the beginning of his reign, distracted Castile. There was\r\nlittle to gratify the pride of the Spaniard in the position which he\r\noccupied at the imperial court. Charles regarded Spain chiefly for the\r\nresources she afforded for carrying on his ambitious enterprises. When\r\nhe visited her, it was usually to draw supplies from the cortes. The\r\nSpaniards understood this, and bore less affection to his person than to\r\nmany of their monarchs far inferior to him in the qualities for exciting\r\nit. They hardly regarded him as one of the nation. There was, indeed,\r\nnothing national in the reign of Charles. His most intimate relations\r\nwere with Germany; and as the Emperor Charles the Fifth of Germany, not\r\nas King Charles the First of Spain, he was known in his own time, and\r\nstands recorded on the pages of history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPAIN UNDER CHARLES THE FIFTH.]\r\n\r\nWhen Charles ascended the throne, at the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, Europe may be said to have been much in the same condition, in\r\none respect, as she was at the beginning of the eighth. The Turk menaced\r\nher on the east, in the same manner as the Arab had before menaced her\r\non the west. The hour seemed to be fast approaching which was to decide\r\nwhether Christianity or Mahometanism should hold the ascendant. The\r\nOttoman tide of conquest rolled up to the very walls of Vienna; and\r\nCharles, who, as head of the empire, was placed on the frontier of\r\nChristendom, was called on to repel it. When thirty-two years of age, he\r\nmarched against the formidable Solyman, drove him to an ignominious\r\nretreat, and, at less cost of life than is often expended in a skirmish,\r\nsaved Europe from invasion. He afterwards crossed the sea to Tunis,\r\nthen occupied by a horde of pirates, the scourge of the Mediterranean.\r\nHe beat them in a bloody battle, slew their chief, and liberated ten\r\nthousand captives from their dungeons. All Europe rang with the praises\r\nof the young hero, who thus consecrated his arms to the service of the\r\nCross, and stood forward as the true champion of Christendom.\r\n\r\nBut from this high position Charles was repeatedly summoned to other\r\ncontests, of a more personal and far less honorable character. Such was\r\nhis long and bloody quarrel with Francis the First. It was hardly\r\npossible that two princes, so well matched in years, power, pretensions,\r\nand, above all, love of military glory, with dominions touching on one\r\nanother through their whole extent, could long remain without cause of\r\nrivalry and collision. Such rivalry did exist from the moment that the\r\ngreat prize of the empire was adjudged to Charles; and through the whole\r\nof their long struggle, with the exception of a few reverses, the\r\nsuperior genius of the emperor triumphed over his bold, but less politic\r\nadversary.\r\n\r\nThere was still a third contest, on which the strength of the Spanish\r\nmonarch was freely expended through the greater part of his reign,--his\r\ncontest with the Lutheran princes of Germany. Here, too, for a long\r\ntime, fortune favored him. But it is easier to contend against man than\r\nagainst a great moral principle. The principle of reform had struck too\r\ndeep into the mind of Germany to be eradicated by force or by fraud.\r\nCharles, for a long time, by a course of crafty policy, succeeded in\r\nbaffling the Protestant league; and, by the decisive victory at\r\nMuhlberg, seemed, at last, to have broken it altogether. But his success\r\nonly ministered to his ruin. The very man on whom he bestowed the spoils\r\nof victory turned them against his benefactor. Charles, ill in body and\r\nmind, and glad to escape from his enemies under cover of the night and a\r\ndriving tempest, was at length compelled to sign the treaty of Passau,\r\nwhich secured to the Protestants those religious immunities against\r\nwhich he had contended through his whole reign.\r\n\r\nNot long after, he experienced another humiliating reverse from France,\r\nthen ruled by a younger rival, Henry the Second, the son of Francis. The\r\ngood star of Charles--the star of Austria--seemed to have set; and as he\r\nreluctantly raised the siege of Metz, he was heard bitterly to exclaim,\r\n\"Fortune is a strumpet, who reserves her favors for the young!\"\r\n\r\nWith spirits greatly depressed by his reverses, and still more by the\r\nstate of his health, which precluded him from taking part in the manly\r\nand martial exercises to which he had been accustomed, he felt that he\r\nhad no longer the same strength as formerly to bear up under the toils\r\nof empire. When but little more than thirty years of age, he had been\r\nattacked by the gout, and of late had been so sorely afflicted with that\r\ndisorder, that he had nearly lost the use of his limbs. The man who,\r\ncased in steel, had passed whole days and nights in the saddle,\r\nindifferent to the weather and the season, could now hardly drag himself\r\nalong with the aid of his staff. For days he was confined to his bed;\r\nand he did not leave his room for weeks together. His mind became\r\noppressed with melancholy, which was, to some extent, a constitutional\r\ninfirmity. His chief pleasure was in listening to books, especially of a\r\nreligious character. He denied himself to all except his most intimate\r\nand trusted counsellors. He lost his interest in affairs; and for whole\r\nmonths, according to one of his biographers, who had access to his\r\nperson, he refused to receive any public communication, or to subscribe\r\nany document, or even letter.[2] One cannot understand how the business\r\nof the nation could have been conducted in such a state of things.\r\nAfter the death of his mother, Joanna, his mind became more deeply\r\ntinctured with those gloomy fancies which in her amounted to downright\r\ninsanity. He imagined he heard her voice calling on him to follow her.\r\nHis thoughts were now turned from secular concerns to those of his own\r\nsoul; and he resolved to put in execution a plan for resigning his crown\r\nand withdrawing to some religious retreat, where he might prepare for\r\nhis latter end. This plan he had conceived many years before, in the\r\nfull tide of successful ambition. So opposite were the elements at work\r\nin the character of this extraordinary man!\r\n\r\nAlthough he had chosen the place of his retreat, he had been deterred\r\nfrom immediately executing his purpose by the forlorn condition of his\r\nmother, and the tender age of his son. The first obstacle was now\r\nremoved by the death of Joanna, after a reign--a nominal reign--of half\r\na century, in which the cloud that had settled on her intellect at her\r\nhusband's death was never dispelled.\r\n\r\nThe age of Philip, his son and heir, was also no longer an objection.\r\nFrom early boyhood he had been trained to the duties of his station,\r\nand, when very young, had been intrusted with the government of Castile.\r\nHis father had surrounded him with able and experienced counsellors, and\r\ntheir pupil, who showed a discretion far beyond his years, had largely\r\nprofited by their lessons. He had now entered his twenty-ninth year, an\r\nage when the character is formed, and when, if ever, he might be\r\nsupposed qualified to assume the duties of government. His father had\r\nalready ceded to him the sovereignty of Naples and Milan, on occasion of\r\nthe prince's marriage with Mary of England. He was on a visit to that\r\ncountry, when Charles, having decided on the act of abdication, sent to\r\nrequire his son's attendance at Brussels, where the ceremony was to be\r\nperformed. The different provinces of the Netherlands were also summoned\r\nto send their deputies, with authority to receive the emperor's\r\nresignation, and to transfer their allegiance to his successor. As a\r\npreliminary step, on the twenty-second of October, 1555, he conferred on\r\nPhilip the grand-mastership--which, as Lord of Flanders, was vested in\r\nhimself--of the _toison d'or_, the order of the Golden Fleece, of\r\nBurgundy; the proudest and most coveted, at that day, of all the\r\nmilitary orders of knighthood.\r\n\r\nPreparations were then made for conducting the ceremony of abdication\r\nwith all the pomp and solemnity suited to so august an occasion. The\r\ngreat hall of the royal palace of Brussels was selected for the scene of\r\nit. The walls of the spacious apartment were hung with tapestry, and the\r\nfloor was covered with rich carpeting. A scaffold was erected, at one\r\nend of the room, to the height of six or seven steps. On it was placed a\r\nthrone, or chair of state, for the emperor, with other seats for Philip,\r\nand for the great Flemish lords who were to attend the person of their\r\nsovereign. Above the throne was suspended a gorgeous canopy, on which\r\nwere emblazoned the arms of the ducal house of Burgundy. In front of the\r\nscaffolding, accommodations were provided for the deputies of the\r\nprovinces, who were to be seated on benches arranged according to their\r\nrespective rights of precedence.[3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CEREMONY OF ABDICATION.]\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fifth of October, the day fixed for the ceremony, Charles\r\nthe Fifth executed an instrument by which he ceded to his son the\r\nsovereignty of Flanders.[4] Mass was then performed; and the emperor,\r\naccompanied by Philip and a numerous retinue, proceeded in state to the\r\ngreat hall, where the deputies were already assembled.[5]\r\n\r\nCharles was, at this time, in the fifty-sixth year of his age. His form\r\nwas slightly bent,--but it was by disease more than by time,--and on his\r\ncountenance might be traced the marks of anxiety and rough exposure. Yet\r\nit still wore that majesty of expression so conspicuous in his portraits\r\nby the inimitable pencil of Titian. His hair, once of a light color,\r\napproaching to yellow, had begun to turn before he was forty, and, as\r\nwell as his beard, was now gray. His forehead was broad and expansive;\r\nhis nose aquiline. His blue eyes and fair complexion intimated his\r\nTeutonic descent. The only feature in his countenance decidedly bad was\r\nhis lower jaw, protruding with its thick, heavy lip, so characteristic\r\nof the physiognomies of the Austrian dynasty.[6]\r\n\r\nIn stature he was about the middle height. His limbs were strongly knit,\r\nand once well formed, though now the extremities were sadly distorted by\r\ndisease. The emperor leaned for support on a staff with one hand, while\r\nwith the other he rested on the arm of William of Orange, who, then\r\nyoung, was destined at a later day to become the most formidable enemy\r\nof his house. The grave demeanor of Charles was rendered still more\r\nimpressive by his dress; for he was in mourning for his mother; and the\r\nsable hue of his attire was relieved only by a single ornament, the\r\nsuperb collar of the Golden Fleece, which hung from his neck.\r\n\r\nBehind the emperor came Philip, the heir of his vast dominions. He was\r\nof a middle height, of much the same proportions as his father, whom he\r\nresembled also in his lineaments,--except that those of the son wore a\r\nmore sombre, and perhaps a sinister expression; while there was a\r\nreserve in his manner, in spite of his efforts to the contrary, as if he\r\nwould shroud his thoughts from observation. The magnificence of his\r\ndress corresponded with his royal station, and formed a contrast to that\r\nof his father, who was quitting the pomp and grandeur of the world, on\r\nwhich the son was about to enter.\r\n\r\nNext to Philip came Mary, the emperor's sister, formerly queen of\r\nHungary. She had filled the post of regent of the Low Countries for\r\nnearly twenty years, and now welcomed the hour when she was to resign\r\nthe burden of sovereignty to her nephew, and withdraw, like her imperial\r\nbrother, into private life. Another sister of Charles, Eleanor, widow of\r\nthe French king, Francis the First, also took part in these ceremonies,\r\nprevious to her departure for Spain, whither she was to accompany the\r\nemperor.\r\n\r\nAfter these members of the imperial family came the nobility of the\r\nNetherlands, the knights of the Golden Fleece, the royal counsellors,\r\nand the great officers of the household, all splendidly attired in their\r\nrobes of state, and proudly displaying the insignia of their orders.\r\nWhen the emperor had mounted his throne, with Philip on his right hand,\r\nthe Regent Mary on his left, and the rest of his retinue disposed along\r\nthe seats prepared for them on the platform, the president of the\r\ncouncil of Flanders addressed the assembly. He briefly explained the\r\nobject for which they had been summoned, and the motives which had\r\ninduced their master to abdicate the throne; and he concluded by\r\nrequiring them, in their sovereign's name, to transfer their allegiance\r\nfrom himself to Philip, his son and rightful heir.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, Charles rose to address a few parting words to his\r\nsubjects. He stood with apparent difficulty, and rested his right hand\r\non the shoulder of the Prince of Orange, intimating, by this preference\r\non so distinguished an occasion, the high favour in which he held the\r\nyoung nobleman. In the other hand he held a paper, containing some hints\r\nfor his discourse, and occasionally cast his eyes on it, to refresh his\r\nmemory. He spoke in the French language.\r\n\r\nHe was unwilling, he said, to part from his people without a few words\r\nfrom his own lips. It was now forty years since he had been intrusted\r\nwith the sceptre of the Netherlands. He was soon after called to take\r\ncharge of a still more extensive empire, both in Spain and in Germany,\r\ninvolving a heavy responsibility for one so young. He had, however,\r\nendeavored earnestly to do his duty to the best of his abilities. He had\r\nbeen ever mindful of the interests of the dear land of his birth, but,\r\nabove all, of the great interests of Christianity. His first object had\r\nbeen to maintain these inviolate against the infidel. In this he had\r\nbeen thwarted, partly by the jealousy of neighboring powers, and partly\r\nby the factions of the heretical princes of Germany.\r\n\r\nIn the performance of his great work, he had never consulted his ease.\r\nHis expeditions, in war and in peace, to France, England, Germany,\r\nItaly, Spain, and Flanders, had amounted to no less than forty. Four\r\ntimes he had crossed the Spanish seas, and eight times the\r\nMediterranean. He had shrunk from no toil, while he had the strength to\r\nendure it. But a cruel malady had deprived him of that strength.\r\nConscious of his inability to discharge the duties of his station, he\r\nhad long since come to the resolution to relinquish it. From this he had\r\nbeen diverted only by the situation of his unfortunate parent, and by\r\nthe inexperience of his son. These objections no longer existed; and he\r\nshould not stand excused, in the eye of Heaven or of the world, if he\r\nshould insist on still holding the reins of government when he was\r\nincapable of managing them,--when every year his incapacity must become\r\nmore obvious.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CEREMONY OF ABDICATION]\r\n\r\nHe begged them to believe that this, and no other motive, induced him to\r\nresign the sceptre which he had so long swayed. They had been to him\r\ndutiful and loving subjects; and such, he doubted not, they would prove\r\nto his successor. Above all things, he besought them to maintain the\r\npurity of the faith. If any one, in these licentious times, had admitted\r\ndoubts into his bosom, let such doubts be extirpated at once. \"I know\r\nwell,\" he concluded, \"that, in my long administration, I have fallen\r\ninto many errors, and committed some wrongs, but it was from ignorance;\r\nand, if there be any here whom I have wronged, they will believe that it\r\nwas not intended, and grant me their forgiveness.\"[7]\r\n\r\nWhile the emperor was speaking, a breathless silence pervaded the whole\r\naudience. Charles had ever been dear to the people of the\r\nNetherlands,--the land of his birth. They took a national pride in his\r\nachievements, and felt that his glory reflected a peculiar lustre on\r\nthemselves. As they now gazed for the last time on that revered form,\r\nand listened to the parting admonitions from his lips, they were deeply\r\naffected, and not a dry eye was to be seen in the assembly.\r\n\r\nAfter a short interval, Charles, turning to Philip, who, in an attitude\r\nof deep respect, stood awaiting his commands, he thus addressed\r\nhim:--\"If the vast possessions which are now bestowed on you had come by\r\ninheritance, there would be abundant cause for gratitude. How much more,\r\nwhen they come as a free gift in the lifetime of your father! But,\r\nhowever large the debt, I shall consider it all repaid, if you only\r\ndischarge your duty to your subjects. So rule over them, that men shall\r\ncommend, and not censure me for the part I am now acting. Go on as you\r\nhave begun. Fear God; live justly; respect the laws; above all, cherish\r\nthe interests of religion; and may the Almighty bless you with a son, to\r\nwhom, when old and stricken with disease, you may be able to resign your\r\nkingdom with the same good-will with which I now resign mine to you.\"\r\n\r\nAs he ceased, Philip, much affected, would have thrown himself at his\r\nfather's feet, assuring him of his intention to do all in his power to\r\nmerit such goodness; but Charles, raising his son, tenderly embraced\r\nhim, while the tears flowed fast down his cheeks. Every one, even the\r\nmost stoical, was touched by this affecting scene; \"and nothing,\" says\r\none who was present, \"was to be heard, throughout the hall, but sobs and\r\nill-suppressed moans.\" Charles, exhausted by his efforts, and deadly\r\npale, sank back upon his seat; while, with feeble accents, he exclaimed,\r\nas he gazed on his people, \"God bless you! God bless you!\"[8]\r\n\r\nAfter these emotions had somewhat subsided, Philip arose, and,\r\ndelivering himself in French, briefly told the deputies of the regret\r\nwhich he felt at not being able to address them in their native\r\nlanguage, and to assure them of the favor and high regard in which he\r\nheld them. This would be done for him by the bishop of Arras.\r\n\r\nThis was Antony Perennot, better known as Cardinal Granvelle, son of the\r\nfamous minister of Charles the Fifth, and destined himself to a still\r\nhigher celebrity as the minister of Philip the Second. In clear and\r\nfluent language, he gave the deputies the promise of their new sovereign\r\nto respect the laws and liberties of the nation; invoking them, on his\r\nbehalf, to aid him with their counsels, and, like royal vassals, to\r\nmaintain the authority of the law in his dominions. After a suitable\r\nresponse from the deputies, filled with sentiments of regret for the\r\nloss of their late monarch, and with those of loyalty to their new one,\r\nthe Regent Mary formally abdicated her authority, and the session\r\nclosed. So ended a ceremony, which, considering the importance of its\r\nconsequences, the character of the actors, and the solemnity of the\r\nproceedings, is one of the most remarkable in history. That the crown of\r\nthe monarch is lined with thorns, is a trite maxim; and it requires no\r\nphilosophy to teach us that happiness does not depend on station. Yet,\r\nnumerous as are the instances of those who have waded to a throne\r\nthrough seas of blood, there are but few who, when they have once tasted\r\nthe sweets of sovereignty, have been content to resign them; still fewer\r\nwho, when they have done so, have had the philosophy to conform to their\r\nchange of condition, and not to repent it. Charles, as the event proved,\r\nwas one of these few.\r\n\r\nOn the sixteenth day of January, 1556, in the presence of such of the\r\nSpanish nobility as were at the court, he executed the deeds by which he\r\nceded the sovereignty of Castile and Aragon, with their dependencies, to\r\nPhilip.[9]\r\n\r\nThe last act that remained for him to perform was to resign the crown of\r\nGermany in favor of his brother Ferdinand. But this he consented to\r\ndefer some time longer, at the request of Ferdinand himself, who wished\r\nto prepare the minds of the electoral college for this unexpected\r\ntransfer of the imperial sceptre. But, while Charles consented to retain\r\nfor the present the title of Emperor, the real power and the burden of\r\nsovereignty would remain with Ferdinand.[10]\r\n\r\nAt the time of abdicating the throne of the Netherlands, Charles was\r\nstill at war with France. He had endeavored to negotiate a permanent\r\npeace with that country; and, although he failed in this, he had the\r\nsatisfaction, on the fifth of February, 1556, to arrange a truce for\r\nfive years, which left both powers in the possession of their respective\r\nconquests. In the existing state of these conquests, the truce was by no\r\nmeans favorable to Spain. But Charles would have made even larger\r\nconcessions, rather than leave the legacy of a war to his less\r\nexperienced successor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS RETURN TO SPAIN]\r\n\r\nHaving thus completed all his arrangements, by which the most powerful\r\nprince of Europe descended to the rank of a private gentleman, Charles\r\nhad no longer reason to defer his departure, and he proceeded to the\r\nplace of embarkation. He was accompanied by a train of Flemish\r\ncourtiers, and by the foreign ambassadors, to the latter of whom he\r\nwarmly commended the interests of his son. A fleet of fifty-six sail was\r\nriding at anchor in the port of Flushing, ready to transport him and his\r\nretinue to Spain. From the imperial household, consisting of seven\r\nhundred and sixty-two persons, he selected a hundred and fifty as his\r\nescort; and accompanied by his sisters, after taking an affectionate\r\nfarewell of Philip, whose affairs detained him in Flanders, on the\r\nthirteenth of September he sailed from the harbor of Flushing.\r\n\r\nThe passage was a boisterous one; and Charles, who suffered greatly from\r\nhis old enemy, the gout, landed, in a feeble state, at Laredo, in\r\nBiscay, on the twenty-eighth of the month. Scarcely had he left the\r\nvessel, when a storm fell with fury on the fleet, and did some mischief\r\nto the shipping in the harbor. The pious Spaniard saw in this the finger\r\nof Providence, which had allowed no harm to the squadron till its royal\r\nfreight had been brought safely to the shore.[11]\r\n\r\nOn landing, Charles complained, and with some reason, of the scanty\r\npreparations that had been made for him. Philip had written several\r\ntimes to his sister, the regent, ordering her to have everything ready\r\nfor the emperor on his arrival.[12] Joanna had accordingly issued her\r\norders to that effect. But promptness and punctuality are not virtues of\r\nthe Spaniard. Some apology may be found for their deficiency in the\r\npresent instance; as Charles himself had so often postponed his\r\ndeparture from the Low Countries, that, when he did come, the people\r\nwere, in a manner, taken by surprise. That the neglect was not\r\nintentional is evident from their subsequent conduct.[13]\r\n\r\nCharles, whose infirmities compelled him to be borne in a litter, was\r\ngreeted, everywhere on the road, like a sovereign returning to his\r\ndominions. It was evening when he reached the ancient city of Burgos;\r\nand, as he passed through its illuminated streets the bells rang\r\nmerrily, to give him welcome. He remained there three days, experiencing\r\nthe hospitalities of the great constable, and receiving the homage of\r\nthe northern lords, as well as of the people, who thronged the route by\r\nwhich he was to pass. At Torquemada, among those who came to pay their\r\nrespects to their former master was Gasca, the good president of Peru.\r\nHe had been sent to America to suppress the insurrection of Gonzalo\r\nPizarro, and restore tranquillity to the country. In the execution of\r\nthis delicate mission, he succeeded so well, that the emperor, on his\r\nreturn, had raised him to the see of Plasencia; and the excellent man\r\nnow lived in his diocese, where, in the peaceful discharge of his\r\nepiscopal functions, he probably enjoyed far greater contentment than\r\nhe could have derived from the dazzling, but difficult post of an\r\nAmerican viceroy.\r\n\r\nFrom Torquemada, Charles slowly proceeded to Valladolid, where his\r\ndaughter, the Regent Joanna, was then holding her court. Preparations\r\nwere made for receiving him in a manner suited to his former rank. But\r\nCharles positively declined these honours, reserving them for his two\r\nsisters, the dowager queens of France and Hungary, who accordingly made\r\ntheir entrance into the capital in great state, on the day following\r\nthat on which their royal brother had entered it with the simplicity of\r\na private citizen.\r\n\r\nHe remained here some time, in order to recover from the fatigue of his\r\njourney; and, although he took little part in the festivities of the\r\ncourt, he gave audience to his ancient ministers, and to such of the\r\nCastilian grandees as were eager to render him their obeisance. At the\r\ncourt he had also the opportunity of seeing his grandson Carlos, the\r\nheir of the monarchy; and his quick eye, it is said, in this short time,\r\nsaw enough in the prince's deportment to fill him with ominous\r\nforebodings.\r\n\r\nCharles prolonged his stay fourteen days in Valladolid, during which\r\ntime his health was much benefited by the purity and the dryness of the\r\natmosphere. On his departure, his royal sisters would have borne him\r\ncompany, and even have fixed their permanent residence near his own. But\r\nto this he would not consent; and, taking a tender farewell of every\r\nmember of his family,--as one who was never to behold them again,--he\r\nresumed his journey.\r\n\r\nThe place he had chosen for his retreat was the monastery of Yuste, in\r\nthe province of Estremadura, not many miles from Plasencia. On his way\r\nthither he halted near three months at Jarandilla, the residence of the\r\ncount of Oropesa, waiting there for the completion of some repairs that\r\nwere going on in the monastery, as well as for the remittance of a\r\nconsiderable sum of money, which he was daily expecting. This he\r\nrequired chiefly to discharge the arrears due to some of his old\r\nretainers; and the failure of the remittance has brought some obloquy on\r\nPhilip, who could so soon show himself unmindful of his obligations to\r\nhis father. But the blame should rather be charged on Philip's ministers\r\nthan on Philip, absent as he was at that time from the country, and\r\nincapable of taking personal cognizance of the matter. Punctuality in\r\nhis pecuniary engagements was a virtue to which neither Charles nor\r\nPhilip--the masters of the Indies--could at any time lay claim. But the\r\nimputation of parsimony, or even indifference, on the part of the\r\nlatter, in his relations with his father, is fully disproved by the\r\nsubsequent history of that monarch at the convent of Yuste.[14]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BIRTH OF PHILIP.]\r\n\r\nThis place, it is said, had attracted his eye many years before, when on\r\na visit to that part of the country, and he marked it for his future\r\nresidence. The convent was tenanted by monks of the strictest order of\r\nSaint Jerome. But, however strict in their monastic rule, the good\r\nfathers showed much taste in the selection of their ground, as well as\r\nin the embellishment of it. It lay in a wild, romantic country,\r\nembosomed among hills that stretch along the northern confines of\r\nEstremadura. The building, which was of great antiquity, had been\r\nsurrounded by its inmates with cultivated gardens, and with groves of\r\norange, lemon, and myrtle, whose fragrance was tempered by the\r\nrefreshing coolness of the waters that gushed forth in abundance from\r\nthe rocky sides of the hills. It was a delicious retreat, and, by its\r\ncalm seclusion and the character of its scenery, was well suited to\r\nwithdraw the mind from the turmoil of the world, and dispose it to\r\nserious meditation. Here the monarch, after a life of restless ambition,\r\nproposed to spend the brief remainder of his days, and dedicate it to\r\nthe salvation of his soul. He could not, however, as the event proved,\r\nclose his heart against all sympathy with mankind, nor refuse to take\r\nsome part in the great questions which then agitated the world. Charles\r\nwas not master of that ignoble philosophy which enabled Diocletian to\r\nturn with contentment from the cares of an empire to those of a\r\ncabbage-garden.--In this retirement we must now leave the royal recluse,\r\nwhile we follow the opening career of the prince whose reign is the\r\nsubject of the present history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nEARLY DAYS OF PHILIP.\r\n\r\nBirth of Philip the Second.--His Education.--Intrusted with the\r\nRegency.--Marries Mary of Portugal.--Visit to Flanders.--Public\r\nFestivities.--Ambitious Schemes.--Returns to Spain.\r\n\r\n1527-1551.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip the Second was born at Valladolid, on the twenty-first of May,\r\n1527. His mother was the Empress Isabella, daughter of Emanuel the Great\r\nof Portugal. By his father he was descended from the ducal houses of\r\nBurgundy and Austria. By both father and mother he claimed a descent\r\nfrom Ferdinand and Isabella the Catholic of Spain. As by blood he was\r\nhalf a Spaniard, so by temperament and character he proved to be wholly\r\nso.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of his baptism was performed with all due solemnity, by\r\nTavera, archbishop of Toledo, on the twenty-fifth of June, when the\r\nroyal infant received the name of Philip, after his paternal\r\ngrandfather, Philip the Handsome, whose brief reign--for which he was\r\nindebted to his union with Joanna, queen-proprietor of Castile--has\r\nhardly secured him a place in the line of Castilian sovereigns.\r\n\r\nThe birth of a son--the heir of so magnificent an empire--was hailed\r\nwith delight both by Charles and by the whole nation, who prepared to\r\ncelebrate it in a style worthy of the event, when tidings reached them\r\nof the capture of Pope Clement the Seventh and the sack of Rome by the\r\nSpanish troops under the constable de Bourbon. The news of this event,\r\nand the cruelties inflicted by the conquerors, filled all Europe with\r\nconsternation. Even the Protestants, who had no superfluous sympathy to\r\nspare for the sufferings of the pope, were shocked by the perpetration\r\nof atrocities compared with which the conduct of Attila and Alaric might\r\nalmost be deemed merciful. Whatever responsibility may attach to Charles\r\non the score of the expedition, it would be injustice to him to suppose\r\nthat he did not share in the general indignation at the manner in which\r\nit was conducted. At all events, he could hardly venture to outrage the\r\nfeelings of Christendom so far as to take the present moment for one of\r\npublic rejoicing. Orders were instantly issued to abandon the intended\r\nfestivities, greatly to the discontent of the people, whose sympathy for\r\nthe pope did not by any means incline them to put this restraint on the\r\nexpression of their loyalty; and they drew from the disappointment an\r\nuncomfortable augury that the reign of the young prince boded no good to\r\nthe Catholic religion.[15]\r\n\r\nIt was not long, however, before the people of Castile had an\r\nopportunity for the full display of their enthusiasm, on the occasion of\r\nPhilip's recognition as rightful heir to the crown. The ceremony was\r\nconducted with great pomp and splendor in the cortes at Madrid, on the\r\nnineteenth of April, 1528, when he was but eleven months old. The prince\r\nwas borne in the arms of his mother, who, with the emperor, was present\r\non the occasion; while the nobles, the clergy, and the commons took the\r\noath of allegiance to the royal infant, as successor to the crown of\r\nCastile. The act of homage was no sooner published, than the nation, as\r\nif by way of compensation for the past, abandoned itself to a general\r\njubilee. Illuminations and bonfires were lighted up in all the towns and\r\nvillages; while everywhere were to be seen dancing, bull-fights, tilts\r\nof reeds, and the other national games of that chivalrous and romantic\r\nland.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, Charles was called by his affairs to other parts of his\r\nfar-extended empire, and he left his infant son to the care of a\r\nPortuguese lady, Doña Leonor Mascareñas, or rather to that of the\r\nEmpress Isabella, in whose prudence and maternal watchfulness he could\r\nsafely confide. On the emperor's return to Spain, when his son was\r\nhardly seven years old, he formed for him a separate establishment, and\r\nselected two persons for the responsible office of superintending his\r\neducation.[16]\r\n\r\nOne of these personages was Juan Martinez Siliceo, at that time\r\nprofessor in the College of Salamanca. He was a man of piety and\r\nlearning, of an accommodating temper,--too accommodating, it appears\r\nfrom some of Charles's letters, for the good of his pupil, though not,\r\nas it would seem, for his own good, since he found such favor with the\r\nprince, that, from an humble ecclesiastic, he was subsequently preferred\r\nto the highest dignities of the Church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS EDUCATION.]\r\n\r\nUnder him Philip was instructed in the ancient classics, and made such\r\nprogress in Latin, that he could write it, and did write it frequently\r\nin after life, with ease and correctness. He studied, also, Italian and\r\nFrench. He seems to have had little knowledge of the former, but French\r\nhe could speak indifferently well, though he was rarely inclined to\r\nventure beyond his own tongue. He showed a more decided taste for\r\nscience, especially the mathematics. He made a careful study of the\r\nprinciples of architecture; and the fruits of this study are to be seen\r\nin some of the noblest monuments erected in that flourishing period of\r\nthe arts. In sculpture and painting he also made some proficiency, and\r\nbecame, in later life, no contemptible critic,--at least for a\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\nThe other functionary charged with Philip's education was Don Juan de\r\nZuñiga, commendador mayor of Castile. He taught his pupil to fence, to\r\nride, to take his part at the tilts and tourneys, and, in short, to\r\nexcel in the chivalrous exercises familiar to cavaliers of his time. He\r\nencouraged Philip to invigorate his constitution by the hardy pleasures\r\nof the chase, to which, however, he was but little addicted as he\r\nadvanced in years.\r\n\r\nBut, besides these personal accomplishments, no one was better qualified\r\nthan Zuñiga to instruct his people in the duties belonging to his royal\r\nstation. He was a man of ancient family, and had passed much of his life\r\nin courts. But he had none of the duplicity or of the suppleness which\r\noften marks the character of the courtier. He possessed too high a\r\nsentiment of honor to allow him to trifle with truth. He spoke his mind\r\nplainly, too plainly sometimes for the taste of his pupil. Charles, who\r\nunderstood the character of Zuñiga, wrote to his son to honor and to\r\ncherish him. \"If he deals plainly with you,\" he said, \"it is for the\r\nlove he bears you. If he were to flatter you, and be only solicitous of\r\nministering to your wishes, he would be like all the rest of the world,\r\nand you would have no one near to tell you the truth;--and a worse thing\r\ncannot happen to any man, old or young; but most of all to the young,\r\nfrom their want of experience to discern truth from error.\" The wise\r\nemperor, who knew how rarely it is that truth is permitted to find its\r\nway to royal ears, set a just value on the man who had the courage to\r\nspeak it.[17]\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of these teachers, and, still more, of the\r\ncircumstances in which he was placed,--the most potent teachers of\r\nall,--Philip grew in years, and slowly unfolded the peculiar qualities\r\nof his disposition. He seemed cautious and reserved in his demeanor, and\r\nslow of speech; yet what he said had a character of thought beyond his\r\nage. At no time did he discover that buoyancy of spirit, or was he\r\nbetrayed into those sallies of temper, which belong to a bold and\r\nadventurous, and often to a generous nature. His deportment was marked\r\nby a seriousness that to some might seem to savor of melancholy. He was\r\nself-possessed, so that even as a boy he was rarely off his guard.[18]\r\n\r\nThe emperor, whose affairs called him away from Spain much the greater\r\npart of his time, had not the power of personally superintending the\r\neducation of his son. Unfortunately for the latter, his excellent mother\r\ndied when he was but twelve years old. Charles, who loved his wife as\r\nmuch as a man is capable of loving whose soul is filled with schemes of\r\nboundless ambition, was at Madrid when he received tidings of her\r\nillness. He posted in all haste to Toledo, where the queen then was, but\r\narrived there only in time to embrace her cold remains before they were\r\nconsigned to the sepulchre. The desolate monarch abandoned himself to an\r\nagony of grief, and was with difficulty withdrawn from the apartment by\r\nhis attendants, to indulge his solitary regrets in the neighboring\r\nmonastery of La Sisla.\r\n\r\nIsabella well deserved to be mourned by her husband. She was a woman\r\nfrom all accounts, possessed of many high and generous qualities. Such\r\nwas her fortitude, that, at the time of her confinement, she was never\r\nheard to utter a groan. She seemed to think any demonstration of\r\nsuffering a weakness, and had the chamber darkened that her attendants\r\nmight not see the distress painted on her countenance.[19] With this\r\nconstancy of spirit, she united many feminine virtues. The palace, under\r\nher rule, became a school of industry. Instead of wasting her leisure\r\nhours in frivolous pleasures, she might be seen busily occupied, with\r\nher maidens, in the elegant labors of the loom; and, like her ancestor,\r\nthe good Queen Isabella the Catholic, she sent more than one piece of\r\ntapestry, worked by her own hands, to adorn the altars of Jerusalem.\r\nThese excellent qualities were enhanced by manners so attractive, that\r\nher effigy was struck on a medal, with a device of the three Graces on\r\nthe reverse side, bearing the motto, _Has Habet et superat_.[20]\r\n\r\nIsabella was but thirty-six years old at the time of her death. Charles\r\nwas not forty. He never married again. Yet the bereavement seems to have\r\nhad little power to soften his nature, or incline him to charity for the\r\nmisconduct, or compassion for the misfortunes of others. It was but a\r\nfew months after the death of his wife, that, on occasion of the\r\ninsurrection of Ghent, he sought a passage through the territory of his\r\nancient enemy of France, descended on the offending city, and took such\r\nvengeance on its wretched inhabitants as made all Europe ring with his\r\ncruelty.[21]\r\n\r\nPhilip was too young at this time to take part in the administration of\r\nthe kingdom during his father's absence. But he was surrounded by able\r\nstatesmen, who familiarized him with ideas of government, by admitting\r\nhim to see the workings of the machinery which he was one day to direct.\r\nCharles was desirous that the attention of his son, even in boyhood,\r\nshould be turned to those affairs which were to form the great business\r\nof his future life. It seems even thus early--at this period of mental\r\ndepression--the emperor cherished the plan of anticipating the natural\r\nconsequence of his decease, by resigning his dominions into the hands of\r\nPhilip so soon as he should be qualified to rule them.\r\n\r\nNo event occurred to disturb the tranquillity of Spain during the\r\nemperor's absence from that country, to which he returned in the winter\r\nof 1541. It was after his disastrous expedition against Algiers,--the\r\nmost disastrous of any that he had yet undertaken. He there saw his navy\r\nsunk or scattered by the tempest, and was fortunate in finding a\r\nshelter, with its shattered remnants, in the port of Carthagena. Soon\r\nafter landing, he received a letter from Philip, condoling with him on\r\nhis losses, and striving to cheer him with the reflection, that they had\r\nbeen caused by the elements, not by his enemies. With this tone of\r\nphilosophy were mingled expressions of sympathy; and Charles may have\r\nbeen gratified with the epistle,--if he could believe it the\r\ncomposition of his son.[22] Philip soon after this made a journey to\r\nthe south; and, in the society of one who was now the chief object of\r\nhis affections, the emperor may have found the best consolation in his\r\nmisfortunes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INTRUSTED WITH THE REGENCY.]\r\n\r\nThe French had availed themselves of the troubled state of Charles's\r\naffairs to make a descent upon Roussillon; and the Dauphin now lay in\r\nsome strength before the gates of Perpignan. The emperor considered this\r\na favorable moment for Philip to take his first lesson in war. The\r\nprince accordingly posted to Valladolid. A considerable force was\r\nquickly mustered; and Philip, taking the command, and supported by some\r\nof the most experienced of his father's generals, descended rapidly\r\ntowards the coast. But the Dauphin did not care to wait for his\r\napproach; and, breaking up his camp, he retreated, without striking a\r\nblow, in all haste, across the mountains. Philip entered the town in\r\ntriumph, and soon after returned, with the unstained laurels of victory,\r\nto receive his father's congratulations. The promptness of his movements\r\non this occasion gained him credit with the Spaniards; and the fortunate\r\nresult seemed to furnish a favorable augury for the future.\r\n\r\nOn his return, the prince was called to preside over the cortes at\r\nMonzon,--a central town, where the deputies of Aragon, Catalonia, and\r\nValencia continued to assemble separately, long after those provinces\r\nhad been united to Castile. Philip, with all the forms prescribed by the\r\nconstitution, received the homage of the representatives assembled, as\r\nsuccessor to the crown of Aragon.\r\n\r\nThe war with France, which, after a temporary suspension, had broken out\r\nwith greater violence than ever, did not permit the emperor long to\r\nprotract his stay in the Peninsula. Indeed, it seemed to his Spanish\r\nsubjects that he rarely visited them, except when his exchequer required\r\nto be replenished for carrying on his restless enterprises, and that he\r\nstayed no longer than was necessary to effect this object. On leaving\r\nthe country, he intrusted the regency to Philip, under the general\r\ndirection of a council consisting of the duke of Alva, Cardinal Tavera,\r\nand the Commendador Cobos. Some time after this, while still lingering\r\nin Catalonia, previous to his embarkation, Charles addressed a letter to\r\nhis son, advising him as to his political course, and freely criticising\r\nthe characters of the great lords associated with him in the government.\r\nThe letter, which is altogether a remarkable document, contains, also,\r\nsome wholesome admonitions on Philip's private conduct. \"The duke of\r\nAlva,\" the emperor emphatically wrote, \"is the ablest statesman and the\r\nbest soldier I have in my dominions. Consult him, above all, in military\r\naffairs; but do not depend upon him entirely in these or in any other\r\nmatters. Depend on no one but yourself. The grandees will be too happy\r\nto secure your favor, and through you to govern the land. But, if you\r\nare thus governed, it will be your ruin. The mere suspicion of it will\r\ndo you infinite prejudice. Make use of all; but lean exclusively on\r\nnone. In your perplexities, ever trust in your Maker. Have no care but\r\nfor him.\" The emperor then passes some strictures on the Commendador\r\nCobos, as too much inclined to pleasure, at the same time admonishing\r\nPhilip of the consequences of a libertine career, fatal alike, he tells\r\nhim, to both soul and body. There seems to have been some ground for\r\nthis admonition, as the young prince had shown a disposition to\r\ngallantry, which did not desert him in later life. \"Yet, on the whole,\"\r\nsays the monarch, \"I will admit I have much reason to be satisfied with\r\nyour behavior. But I would have you perfect; and, to speak frankly,\r\nwhatever other persons may tell you, you have some things to mend yet.\r\nYour confessor,\" he continues, \"is now your old preceptor, the bishop\r\nof Carthagena,\"--to which see the worthy professor had been recently\r\nraised. \"He is a good man, as all the world knows; but I hope he will\r\ntake better care of your conscience than he did of your studies, and\r\nthat he will not show quite so accommodating a temper in regard to the\r\nformer as he did with the latter.\"[23]\r\n\r\nOn the cover of this curious epistle the emperor indorsed a direction to\r\nhis son, to show it to no living person; but if he found himself ill at\r\nany time, to destroy the letter, or seal it up under cover to him. It\r\nwould, indeed, have edified those courtiers, who fancied they stood\r\nhighest in the royal favor, to see how, to their very depths, their\r\ncharacters were sounded, and how clearly their schemes of ambition were\r\nrevealed to the eye of their master. It was this admirable perception of\r\ncharacter which enabled Charles, so generally, to select the right agent\r\nfor the execution of his plans, and thus to insure their success.\r\n\r\nThe letter from Palamos is one among many similar proofs of the care\r\nwith which, even from a distance, Charles watched over his son's course,\r\nand endeavored to form his character. The experienced navigator would\r\nfurnish a chart to the youthful pilot, by which, without other aid, he\r\nmight securely steer through seas strange and unknown to him. Yet there\r\nwas little danger in the navigation, at this period; for Spain lay in a\r\nprofound tranquillity, unruffled by a breath from the rude tempest,\r\nthat, in other parts of Europe, was unsettling princes on their thrones.\r\n\r\nA change was now to take place in Philip's domestic relations. His\r\nmagnificent expectations made him, in the opinion of the world, the best\r\nmatch in Europe. His father had long contemplated the event of his son's\r\nmarrying. He had first meditated an alliance for him with Margaret,\r\ndaughter of Francis the First, by which means the feud with his ancient\r\nrival might be permanently healed. But Philip's inclination was turned\r\nto an alliance with Portugal. This latter was finally adopted by\r\nCharles; and, in December, 1542, Philip was betrothed to the Infanta\r\nMary, daughter of John the Third and of Catharine, the emperor's sister.\r\nShe was, consequently, cousin-german to Philip. At the same time,\r\nJoanna, Charles's youngest daughter, was affianced to the eldest son of\r\nJohn the Third, and heir to his crown. The intermarriages of the royal\r\nhouses of Castile and Portugal were so frequent, that the several\r\nmembers stood in multiplied and most perplexing degrees of affinity with\r\none another.\r\n\r\nJoanna was eight years younger than her brother. Charles had one other\r\nchild, Mary, born the year after Philip. She was destined to a more\r\nsplendid fortune than her sister, as bride of the future emperor of\r\nGermany. Since Philip and the Portuguese princess were now both more\r\nthan sixteen years old, being nearly of the same age, it was resolved\r\nthat their marriage should no longer be deferred. The place appointed\r\nfor the ceremony was the ancient city of Salamanca.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARRIES MARY OF PORTUGAL.]\r\n\r\nIn October, 1543, the Portuguese infanta quitted her father's palace in\r\nLisbon, and set out for Castile. She was attended by a numerous train of\r\nnobles, with the archbishop of Lisbon at their head. A splendid embassy\r\nwas sent to meet her on the borders, and conduct her to Salamanca. At\r\nits head was the duke of Medina Sidonia, chief of the Guzmans, the\r\nwealthiest and most powerful lord in Andalusia. He had fitted up his\r\npalace at Badajoz in the most costly and sumptuous style, for the\r\naccommodation of the princess. The hangings were of cloth of gold; the\r\ncouches, the sideboards, and some of the other furniture, of burnished\r\nsilver. The duke himself rode in a superb litter, and the mules which\r\ncarried it were shod with gold. The members of his household and his\r\nretainers swelled to the number of three thousand, well mounted, wearing\r\nthe liveries and cognizance of their master. Among them was the duke's\r\nprivate band, including several natives of the Indies,--then not a\r\nfamiliar sight in Spain,--displaying on their breasts broad silver\r\nescutcheons, on which were emblazoned the arms of the Guzmans. The\r\nchronicler is diffuse in his account of the infanta's reception, from\r\nwhich a few particulars may be selected for such as take an interest in\r\nthe Spanish costume and manners of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe infanta was five months younger than Philip. She was of the middle\r\nsize, with a good figure, though somewhat inclined to _embonpoint_, and\r\nwas distinguished by a graceful carriage and a pleasing expression of\r\ncountenance. Her dress was of cloth of silver, embroidered with flowers\r\nof gold. She wore a _capa_, or Castilian mantle, of violet-colored\r\nvelvet, figured with gold, and a hat of the same materials, surmounted\r\nby a white and azure plume. The housings of the mule were of rich\r\nbrocade, and Mary rode on a silver saddle.\r\n\r\nAs she approached Salamanca, she was met by the rector and professors of\r\nthe university, in their academic gowns. Next followed the judges and\r\n_regidores_ of the city, in their robes of office, of crimson velvet,\r\nwith hose and shoes of spotless white. After these came the\r\nmilitary,--horse and foot,--in their several companies, making a\r\nbrilliant show with their gay uniforms; and, after going through their\r\nvarious evolutions, they formed into an escort for the princess. In this\r\nway, amidst the sound of music and the shouts of the multitude, the\r\nglittering pageant entered the gates of the capital.\r\n\r\nThe infanta was there received under a superb canopy, supported by the\r\nmagistrates of the city. The late ambassador to Portugal, Don Luis\r\nSarmiento, who had negotiated the marriage treaty, held the bridle of\r\nher mule; and in this state she arrived at the palace of the duke of\r\nAlva, destined for her reception in Salamanca. Here she was received\r\nwith all honour by the duchess, in the presence of a brilliant company\r\nof cavaliers and noble ladies. Each of the ladies was graciously\r\npermitted by the infanta to kiss her hand; but the duchess, the\r\nchronicler is careful to inform us, she distinguished by the honor of an\r\nembrace.\r\n\r\nAll the while, Philip had been in the presence of the infanta, unknown\r\nto herself. Impatient to see his destined bride, the young prince had\r\nsallied out, with a few attendants, to the distance of five or six miles\r\nfrom the city, all in the disguise of huntsmen. He wore a slouched\r\nvelvet hat on his head, and his face was effectually concealed under a\r\ngauze mask, so that he could mingle in the crowd by the side of the\r\ninfanta, and make his own scrutiny, unmarked by any one. In this way he\r\naccompanied the procession during the five hours which it lasted, until\r\nthe darkness had set in; \"if darkness could be spoken of,\" says the\r\nchronicler, \"where the blaze of ten thousand torches shed a light\r\nstronger than day.\"\r\n\r\nThe following evening, November the twelfth, was appointed for the\r\nmarriage. The duke and duchess of Alva stood as sponsors, and the\r\nnuptial ceremony was performed by Tavera, archbishop of Toledo. The\r\nfestivities were prolonged through another week. The saloons were filled\r\nwith the beauty of Castile. The proudest aristocracy in Europe vied with\r\neach other in the display of magnificence at the banquet and the\r\ntourney: and sounds of merriment succeeded to the tranquillity which had\r\nso long reigned in the cloistered shades of Salamanca.\r\n\r\nOn the nineteenth of the month the new-married pair transferred their\r\nresidence to Valladolid,--a city at once fortunate and fatal to the\r\nprincess. Well might the chronicler call it \"fatal;\" for, in less than\r\ntwo years, July 8th, 1545, she there gave birth to a son, the\r\ncelebrated Don Carlos, whose mysterious fate has furnished so fruitful a\r\ntheme for speculation. Mary survived the birth of her child but a few\r\ndays. Had her life been spared, a mother's care might perhaps have given\r\na different direction to his character, and, through this, to his\r\nfortunes. The remains of the infanta, first deposited in the cathedral\r\nof Granada, were afterwards removed to the Escorial, that magnificent\r\nmausoleum prepared by her husband for the royalty of Spain.[24]\r\n\r\nIn the following year died Tavera, archbishop of Toledo. He was an\r\nexcellent man, and greatly valued by the emperor; who may be thought to\r\nhave passed a sufficient encomium on his worth when he declared, that\r\n\"by his death Philip had suffered a greater loss than by that of Mary;\r\nfor he could get another wife, but not another Tavera.\" His place was\r\nfilled by Siliceo, Philip's early preceptor, who, after having been\r\nraised to the archiepiscopal see of Toledo, received a cardinal's hat\r\nfrom Rome. The accommodating spirit of the good ecclesiastic had\r\ndoubtless some influence in his rapid advancement from the condition of\r\na poor teacher in Salamanca to the highest post,--as the see of Toledo,\r\nwith its immense revenues and authority, might be considered,--next to\r\nthe papacy, in the Christian Church.\r\n\r\nFor some years, no event of importance occurred to disturb the repose of\r\nthe Peninsula. But the emperor was engaged in a stormy career abroad, in\r\nwhich his arms were at length crowned with success by the decisive\r\nbattle of Muhlberg.\r\n\r\nThis victory, which secured him the person of his greatest enemy, placed\r\nhim in a position for dictating terms to the Protestant princes of\r\nGermany. He had subsequently withdrawn to Brussels, where he received an\r\nembassy from Philip, congratulating him on the success of his arms.\r\nCharles was desirous to see his son, from whom he had now been separated\r\nnearly six years. He wished, moreover, to introduce him to the\r\nNetherlands, and make him personally acquainted with the people over\r\nwhom he was one day to rule. He sent instructions, accordingly, to\r\nPhilip, to repair to Flanders, so soon as the person appointed to\r\nrelieve him in the government should arrive in Castile.\r\n\r\nThe individual selected by the emperor for this office was Maximilian,\r\nthe son of his brother Ferdinand. He was a young man of good parts,\r\ncorrect judgment, and popular manners,--well qualified, notwithstanding\r\nhis youth, for the post assigned to him. He was betrothed, as already\r\nmentioned, to the emperor's eldest daughter, his cousin Mary; and the\r\nregency was to be delivered into his hands on the marriage of the\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nPhilip received his father's commands while presiding at the cortes of\r\nMonzon. He found the Aragonese legislature by no means so tractable as\r\nthe Castilian. The deputies from the mountains of Aragon and from the\r\nsea-coast of Catalonia were alike sturdy in their refusal to furnish\r\nfurther supplies for those ambitious enterprises, which, whatever glory\r\nthey might bring to their sovereign, were of little benefit to them. The\r\nindependent people of these provinces urged their own claims with a\r\npertinacity, and criticized the conduct of their rulers with a\r\nbluntness, that was little grateful to the ear of majesty. The\r\nconvocation of the Aragonese cortes was, in the view of the king of\r\nSpain, what the convocation of a general council was in that of the\r\npope,--a measure not to be resorted to but from absolute necessity.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of Maximilian in Castile, his marriage with the Infanta\r\nMary was immediately celebrated. The ceremony took place, with all the\r\ncustomary pomp, in the courtly city of Valladolid. Among the festivities\r\nthat followed may be noticed the performance of a comedy of Ariosto,--a\r\nproof that the beautiful Italian literature, which had exercised a\r\nvisible influence on the compositions of the great Castilian poets of\r\nthe time, had now commended itself, in some degree, to the popular\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the country, Philip, by his father's orders, made a\r\nchange in his domestic establishment, which he formed on the Burgundian\r\nmodel. This was more ceremonious, and far more costly, than the\r\nprimitive usage of Castile. A multitude of new offices was created, and\r\nthe most important were filled by grandees of the highest class. The\r\nduke of Alva was made _mayor-domo mayor_; Antonio de Toledo, his\r\nkinsman, master of the horse; Figueroa, count of Feria, captain of the\r\nbody-guard. Among the chamberlains was Ruy Gomez de Silva, prince of\r\nEboli, one of the most important members of the cabinet under Philip.\r\nEven the menial offices connected with the person and table of the\r\nprince were held by men of rank. A guard was lodged in the palace.\r\nPhilip dined in public in great state, attended by his kings-at-arms,\r\nand by a host of minstrels and musicians. One is reminded of the pompous\r\netiquette of the court of Louis the Fourteenth. All this, however, was\r\ndistasteful to the Spaniards, who did not comprehend why the prince\r\nshould relinquish the simple usages of his own land for the fashions of\r\nBurgundy. Neither was it to the taste of Philip himself; but it suited\r\nthat of his father, who was desirous that his son should flatter the\r\nFlemings by the assumption of a state to which they had been accustomed\r\nin their Burgundian princes.[25]\r\n\r\nPhilip, having now completed his arrangements, and surrendered the\r\nregency into the hands of his brother-in-law, had no reason longer to\r\npostpone his journey. He was accompanied by the duke of Alva, Enriquez,\r\nhigh-admiral of Castile, Ruy Gomez, prince of Eboli, and a long train of\r\npersons of the highest rank. There was, besides, a multitude of younger\r\ncavaliers of family. The proudest nobles of the land contended for the\r\nhonor of having their sons take part in the expedition. The number was\r\nstill further augmented by a body of artists and men of science. The\r\nemperor was desirous that Philip should make an appearance that would\r\ndazzle the imaginations of the people among whom he passed.\r\n\r\nWith this brilliant company, Philip began his journey in the autumn of\r\n1548. He took the road to Saragossa, made an excursion to inspect the\r\nfortifications of Perpignan, offered up his prayers at the shrine of Our\r\nLady of Montserrat, passed a day or two at Barcelona, enjoying the fête\r\nprepared for him in the pleasant citron-gardens of the cardinal of\r\nTrent, and thence proceeded to the port of Rosas, where a Genoese fleet,\r\nover which proudly waved the imperial banner, was riding at anchor, and\r\nawaiting his arrival. It consisted of fifty-eight vessels, furnished by\r\nGenoa, Sicily, and Naples, and commanded by the veteran of a hundred\r\nbattles, the famous Andrew Doria.\r\n\r\nPhilip encountered some rough weather on his passage to Genoa. The doge\r\nand the principal senators came out of port in a magnificent galley to\r\nreceive him. The prince landed, amidst the roar of cannon from the walls\r\nand the adjacent fortifications, and was forthwith conducted to the\r\nmansion of the Dorias, preëminent, even in this city of palaces, for\r\nits architectural splendor.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay in Genoa, Philip received all the attentions which an\r\nelegant hospitality could devise. But his hours were not wholly resigned\r\nto pleasure. He received, every day, embassies from the different\r\nItalian states, one of which came from the pope, Paul the Third, with\r\nhis nephew, Ottavio Farnese, at its head. Its especial object was to\r\nsolicit the prince's interest with his father, for the restitution of\r\nParma and Placentia to the Holy See. Philip answered in terms\r\ncomplimentary, indeed, says the historian, \"but sufficiently ambiguous\r\nas to the essential.\"[26] He had already learned his first lesson in\r\nkingcraft. Not long after, the pope sent him a consecrated sword, and\r\nthe hat worn by his holiness on Christmas eve, accompanied by an\r\nautograph letter, in which, after expatiating on the mystic import of\r\nhis gift, he expressed his confidence that in Philip he was one day to\r\nfind the true champion of the Church.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a fortnight, the royal traveller resumed his journey. He\r\ncrossed the famous battle-field of Pavia, and was shown the place where\r\nFrancis the First surrendered himself a prisoner, and where the Spanish\r\nambuscade sallied out and decided the fortune of the day. His bosom\r\nswelled with exultation, as he rode over the ground made memorable by\r\nthe most brilliant victory achieved by his father,--a victory which\r\nopened the way to the implacable hatred of his vanquished rival, and to\r\noceans of blood.\r\n\r\nFrom Pavia he passed on to Milan, the flourishing capital of\r\nLombardy,--the fairest portion of the Spanish dominions in Italy. Milan\r\nwas, at that time, second only to Naples in population. It was second to\r\nno city in the elegance of its buildings, the splendor of its\r\naristocracy, the opulence and mechanical ingenuity of its burghers. It\r\nwas renowned, at the same time, for its delicate fabrics of silk, and\r\nits armor, curiously wrought and inlaid with gold and silver. In all the\r\narts of luxury and material civilization, it was unsurpassed by any of\r\nthe capitals of Christendom.\r\n\r\nAs the prince approached the suburbs, a countless throng of people came\r\nforth to greet him. For fifteen miles before he entered the city, the\r\nroad was spanned by triumphal arches, garlanded with flowers and fruits,\r\nand bearing inscriptions, both in Latin and Italian, filled with praises\r\nof the father and prognostics of the future glory of the son. Amidst the\r\nconcourse were to be seen the noble ladies of Milan, in gay, fantastic\r\ncars, shining in silk brocade, and with sumptuous caparisons for their\r\nhorses. As he drew near the town, two hundred mounted gentlemen came out\r\nto escort him into the place. They were clothed in complete mail of the\r\nfine Milanese workmanship, and were succeeded by fifty pages in gaudy\r\nlivery, devoted to especial attendance on the prince's person, during\r\nhis residence in Milan.\r\n\r\nPhilip entered the gates under a canopy of state, with the cardinal of\r\nTrent on his right hand, and Philibert, prince of Piedmont, on his left.\r\nHe was received, at the entrance, by the governor of the place, attended\r\nby the members of the senate, in their robes of office. The houses which\r\nlined the long street through which the procession passed were hung with\r\ntapestries, and with paintings of the great Italian masters. The\r\nbalconies and verandahs were crowded with spectators, eager to behold\r\ntheir future sovereign, and rending the air with their acclamations. The\r\nceremony of reception was closed, in the evening, by a brilliant display\r\nof fireworks,--in which the Milanese excelled,--and by a general\r\nillumination of the city.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VISIT TO FLANDERS]\r\n\r\nPhilip's time glided away, during his residence at Milan, in a\r\nsuccession of banquets, _fêtes_, and spectacles of every description\r\nwhich the taste and ingenuity of the people could devise for the\r\namusement of their illustrious guest. With none was he more pleased than\r\nwith the theatrical entertainments, conducted with greater elegance and\r\nrefinement in Italy than in any of the countries beyond the Alps. Nor\r\nwas he always a passive spectator at these festivities. He was\r\nespecially fond of dancing, in which his light and agile figure fitted\r\nhim to excel. In the society of ladies he lost much of his habitual\r\nreserve; and the dignified courtesy of his manners seems to have made a\r\nfavorable impression on the fair dames of Italy, who were probably not\r\nless pleased by the display of his munificence. To the governor's wife,\r\nwho had entertained him at a splendid ball, he presented a diamond ring\r\nworth five thousand ducats; and to her daughter he gave a necklace of\r\nrubies worth three thousand. Similar presents, of less value, he\r\nbestowed on others of the court, extending his liberality even to the\r\nmusicians and inferior persons who had contributed to his entertainment.\r\nTo the churches he gave still more substantial proofs of his generosity.\r\nIn short, he showed, on all occasions, a munificent spirit worthy of his\r\nroyal station.\r\n\r\nHe took some pains, moreover, to reciprocate the civilities he had\r\nreceived, by entertaining his hosts in return. He was particularly\r\nfortunate in exhibiting to them a curious spectacle, which, even with\r\nthis pleasure-loving people, had the rare merit of novelty. This was the\r\ngraceful tourney introduced into Castile from the Spanish Arabs. The\r\nhighest nobles in his suite took the lead in it. The cavaliers were\r\narranged in six quadrilles, or factions, each wearing its distinctive\r\nlivery and badges, with their heads protected by shawls, or turbans,\r\nwreathed around them in the Moorish fashion. They were mounted _à la\r\ngineta_, that is, on the light jennet of Andalusia,--a cross of the\r\nArabian. In their hands they brandished their slender lances, with long\r\nstreamers attached to them, of some gay color, that denoted the\r\nparticular faction of the cavalier. Thus lightly equipped and mounted,\r\nthe Spanish knights went through the delicate manoeuvres of the Moorish\r\ntilt of reeds, showing an easy horsemanship, and performing feats of\r\nagility and grace, which delighted the Italians, keenly alive to the\r\nbeautiful, but hitherto accustomed only to the more ponderous and clumsy\r\nexercises of the European tourney.[27]\r\n\r\nAfter some weeks, Prince Philip quitted the hospitable walls of Milan,\r\nand set out for the north. Before leaving the place, he was joined by a\r\nbody of two hundred mounted arquebusiers, wearing his own yellow\r\nuniform, and commanded by the duke of Arschot. They had been sent to him\r\nas an escort by his father. He crossed the Tyrol, then took the road by\r\nthe way of Munich, Trent, and Heidelberg, and so on towards Flanders. On\r\nall the route, the royal party was beset by multitudes of both sexes,\r\npressing to catch a glimpse of the young prince who was one day to sway\r\nthe mightiest sceptre in Europe. The magistrates of the cities through\r\nwhich he passed welcomed him with complimentary addresses, and with\r\npresents, frequently in the form of silver urns, or goblets, filled with\r\ngolden ducats. Philip received the donatives with a gracious\r\ncondescension; and, in truth, they did not come amiss in this season of\r\nlavish expenditure. To the addresses, the duke of Alva, who rode by the\r\nprince's side, usually responded. The whole of the long journey was\r\nperformed on horseback,--the only sure mode of conveyance in a country\r\nwhere the roads were seldom practicable for carriages.\r\n\r\nAt length, after a journey of four months, the royal cavalcade drew\r\nnear the city of Brussels. Their approach to a great town was intimated\r\nby the crowds who came to welcome them; and Philip was greeted with a\r\ntumultuous enthusiasm, which made him feel that he was now indeed in the\r\nmidst of his own people. The throng was soon swelled by bodies of the\r\nmilitary; and with this loyal escort, amidst the roar of artillery and\r\nthe ringing of bells, which sent forth a merry peal from every tower and\r\nsteeple, Philip made his first entrance into the capital of Belgium.\r\n\r\nThe Regent Mary held her court there, and her brother, the emperor, was\r\noccupying the palace with her. It was not long before the father had\r\nagain the satisfaction of embracing his son, from whom he had been\r\nseparated so many years. He must have been pleased with the alteration\r\nwhich time had wrought in Philip's appearance. He was now twenty-one\r\nyears of age, and was distinguished by a comeliness of person, remarked\r\nupon by more than one who had access to his presence. Their report is\r\nconfirmed by the portraits of him from the pencil of Titian,--taken\r\nbefore the freshness of youth had faded into the sallow hue of disease,\r\nand when care and anxiety had not yet given a sombre, perhaps sullen,\r\nexpression, to his features.\r\n\r\nHe had a fair, and even delicate complexion. His hair and beard were of\r\na light yellow. His eyes were blue, with the eyebrows somewhat too\r\nclosely knit together. His nose was thin and aquiline. The principal\r\nblemish in his countenance was his thick Austrian lip. His lower jaw\r\nprotruded even more than that of his father. To his father, indeed, he\r\nbore a great resemblance in his lineaments, though those of Philip were\r\nof a less intellectual cast. In stature he was somewhat below the middle\r\nheight, with a slight, symmetrical figure and well-made limbs. He was\r\nattentive to his dress, which was rich and elegant, but without any\r\naffectation of ornament. His demeanor was grave with that ceremonious\r\nobservance which marked the old Castilian, and which may be thought the\r\nnatural expression of Philip's slow and phlegmatic temperament.[28]\r\n\r\nDuring his long residence in Brussels, Charles had the opportunity of\r\nsuperintending his son's education in one department in which it was\r\ndeficient,--the science of government. And, surely, no instructor could\r\nhave been found with larger experience than the man who had been at the\r\nhead of all the great political movements in Europe for the last quarter\r\nof a century. Philip passed some time, every day, in his father's\r\ncabinet, conversing with him on public affairs, or attending the\r\nsessions of the council of state. It can hardly be doubted that Charles,\r\nin his private instruction, inculcated on his son two principles so\r\nprominent throughout Philip's administration,--to maintain the royal\r\nauthority in its full extent, and to enforce a strict conformity to the\r\nRoman Catholic Communion. It is probable that he found his son an apt\r\nand docile scholar. Philip acquired, at least, such habits of patient\r\napplication, and of watching over the execution of his own plans, as\r\nhave been possessed by few princes.[29]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PUBLIC FESTIVITIES.]\r\n\r\nThe great object of Philip's visit to the Low Countries had been, to\r\npresent himself to the people of the different provinces, to study their\r\npeculiar characters on their own soil, and obtain their recognition as\r\ntheir future sovereign. After a long residence at Brussels, he set out\r\non a tour through the provinces. He was accompanied by the queen-regent,\r\nand by the same splendid retinue as on his entrance into the country,\r\nwith the addition of a large number of the nobles.\r\n\r\nThe Netherlands had ever been treated by Charles with particular favor,\r\nand, under his royal patronage, although the country did not develop its\r\nresources as under its own free institutions of a later period, it had\r\ngreatly prospered. It was more thickly studded with trading towns than\r\nany country of similar extent in Europe; and its flourishing communities\r\nheld the first rank in wealth, industry, and commercial enterprise, as\r\nwell as in the splendid way of living maintained by the aristocracy. On\r\nthe present occasion, these communities vied with one another in their\r\nloyal demonstrations towards the prince, and in the splendor of the\r\nreception which they gave him. A work was compiled by one of the royal\r\nsuite, setting forth the manifold honors paid to Philip through the\r\nwhole of the tour, which, even more than his former journey, had the\r\naspect of a triumphal progress. The book grew, under the hands of its\r\npatriotic author, to the size of a bulky folio, which, however\r\ninteresting to his contemporaries, would have but slender attraction for\r\nthe present generation.[30] The mere inscriptions emblazoned on the\r\ntriumphal arches, and on the public buildings, spread over a multitude\r\nof pages. They were both in Latin and in the language of the country,\r\nand they augured the happy days in store for the nation, when, under the\r\nbenignant sceptre of Philip, it should enjoy the sweets of tranquillity\r\nand freedom. Happy auguries! which showed that the prophet was not\r\ngifted with the spirit of prophecy.[31]\r\n\r\nIn these solemnities, Antwerp alone expended fifty thousand pistoles.\r\nBut no place compared with Brussels in the costliness and splendor of\r\nits festivities, the most remarkable of which was a tournament. Under\r\ntheir Burgundian princes the Flemings had been familiar with these\r\nchivalrous pageants. The age of chivalry was, indeed, fast fading away\r\nbefore the use of gunpowder and other improvements in military science.\r\nBut it was admitted that no tourney had been maintained with so much\r\nmagnificence and knightly prowess since the days of Charles the Bold.\r\nThe old chronicler's narrative of the event, like the pages of\r\nFroissart, seems instinct with the spirit of a feudal age. I will give a\r\nfew details, at the hazard of appearing trivial to those who may think\r\nwe have dwelt long enough on the pageants of the courts of Castile and\r\nBurgundy. But such pageants form part of the natural accompaniment of a\r\npicturesque age, and the illustrations they afford of the manners of the\r\ntime may have an interest for the student of history.\r\n\r\nThe tourney was held in a spacious square, inclosed for the purpose, in\r\nfront of the great palace of Brussels. Four knights were prepared to\r\nmaintain the field against all comers, and jewels of price were to be\r\nawarded as the prize of the victors. The four challengers were Count\r\nMansfeldt, Count Hoorne, Count Aremberg, and the Sieur de Hubermont;\r\namong the judges was the duke of Alva; and in the list of the successful\r\nantagonists we find the names of Prince Philip of Spain, Emanuel\r\nPhilibert, duke of Savoy, and Count Egmont. These are names famous in\r\nhistory. It is curious to observe how the men who were soon to be at a\r\ndeadly feud with one another were thus sportively met to celebrate the\r\npastimes of chivalry.\r\n\r\nThe day was an auspicious one, and the lists were crowded with the\r\nburghers of Brussels, and the people of the surrounding country. The\r\ngalleries which encompassed the area were graced with the rank and\r\nbeauty of the capital. A canopy, embroidered with the imperial arms in\r\ncrimson and gold, indicated the place occupied by Charles the Fifth and\r\nhis sisters, the regent of the Netherlands, and the dowager queen of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nFor several hours the field was gallantly maintained by the four\r\nchallengers against every knight who was ambitious to prove his prowess\r\nin the presence of so illustrious an assembly. At length the trumpets\r\nsounded, and announced the entrance of four cavaliers, whose brilliant\r\ntrain of followers intimated them to be persons of high degree. The four\r\nknights were Prince Philip, the duke of Savoy, Count Egmont, and Juan\r\nManriquez de Lara, major-domo of the emperor. They were clothed in\r\ncomplete mail, over which they wore surcoats of violet-colored velvet,\r\nwhile the caparisons of their horses were of cloth of gold.\r\n\r\nPhilip ran the first course. His antagonist was the Count Mansfeldt, a\r\nFlemish captain of great renown. At the appointed signal, the two\r\nknights spurred against each other, and met in the centre of the lists\r\nwith a shock that shivered their lances to the very grasp. Both knights\r\nreeled in their saddles, but neither lost his seat. The arena resounded\r\nwith the plaudits of the spectators, not the less hearty that one of the\r\ncombatants was the heir apparent.\r\n\r\nThe other cavaliers then tilted, with various success. A general\r\ntournament followed, in which every knight eager to break a lance on\r\nthis fair occasion took part; and many a feat of arms was performed,\r\ndoubtless long remembered by the citizens of Brussels. At the end of the\r\nseventh hour a flourish of trumpets announced the conclusion of the\r\ncontest, and the assembly broke up in admirable order, the knights\r\nretiring to change their heavy panoplies for the lighter vestments of\r\nthe ball-room. A banquet was prepared by the municipality, in a style of\r\nmagnificence worthy of their royal guests. The emperor and his sisters\r\nhonored it with their presence, and witnessed the distribution of the\r\nprizes. Among these, a brilliant ruby, the prize awarded for the _lança\r\nde las damas_,--the \"ladies' lance,\" in the language of chivalry,--was\r\nassigned by the loyal judges to Prince Philip of Spain.\r\n\r\nDancing succeeded to the banquet; and the high-bred courtesy of the\r\nprince was as much commended in the ball-room as his prowess had been in\r\nthe lists. Maskers mingled with the dancers in Oriental costume, some in\r\nthe Turkish, others in the Albanian fashion. The merry revels were not\r\nprolonged beyond the hour of midnight, when the company broke up, loudly\r\ncommending, as they withdrew, the good cheer afforded them by the\r\nhospitable burghers of Brussels.[32]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PUBLIC FESTIVITIES.]\r\n\r\nPhilip won the prize on another occasion, when he tilted against a\r\nvaliant knight, named Quiñones. He was not so fortunate in an encounter\r\nwith the son of his old preceptor, Zuñiga, in which he was struck with\r\nsuch force on the head, that, after being carried some distance by his\r\nhorse, he fell senseless from the saddle. The alarm was great, but the\r\naccident passed away without serious consequences.[33]\r\n\r\nThere were those who denied him skill in the management of his lance.\r\nMarillac, the French ambassador at the imperial court, speaking of a\r\ntourney given by Philip in honor of the princess of Lorraine, at\r\nAugsburg, says he never saw worse lance-playing in his life. At another\r\ntime he remarks, that the Spanish prince could not even hit his\r\nantagonist.[34] It must have been a very palpable hit to be noticed by a\r\nFrenchman. The French regarded the Spaniards of that day in much the\r\nsame manner as they regarded the English at an earlier period, or as\r\nthey have continued to regard them at a later. The long rivalry of the\r\nFrench and Spanish monarchs had infused into the breasts of their\r\nsubjects such feelings of mutual aversion, that the opinions of either\r\nnation in reference to the other, in the sixteenth century, must be\r\nreceived with the greatest distrust.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever may have been Philip's success in these chivalrous\r\ndisplays, it is quite certain they were not to his taste. He took part\r\nin them only to conform to his father's wishes, and to the humor of the\r\nage. Though in his youth he sometimes hunted, he was neither fond of\r\nfield-sports nor of the athletic exercises of chivalry. His constitution\r\nwas far from robust. He sought to invigorate it less by exercise than by\r\ndiet. He confined himself almost wholly to meat, as the most nutritious\r\nfood, abstaining even from fish; as well as from fruit.[35] Besides his\r\nindisposition to active exercises, he had no relish for the gaudy\r\nspectacles so fashionable in that romantic age. The part he had played\r\nin the pageants, during his long tour, had not been of his own seeking.\r\nThough ceremonious, and exacting deference from all who approached him,\r\nhe was not fond of the pomp and parade of a court life. He preferred to\r\npass his hours in the privacy of his own apartment, where he took\r\npleasure in the conversation of a few whom he honored with his regard.\r\nIt was with difficulty that the emperor could induce him to leave his\r\nretirement and present himself in the audience-chamber, or accompany him\r\non visits of ceremony.[36]\r\n\r\nThese reserved and quiet tastes of Philip by no means recommended him to\r\nthe Flemings, accustomed as they were to the pomp and profuse\r\nmagnificence of the Burgundian court. Their free and social tempers were\r\nchilled by his austere demeanor. They contrasted it with the affable\r\ndeportment of his father, who could so well conform to the customs of\r\nthe different nations under his sceptre, and who seemed perfectly to\r\ncomprehend their characters,--the astute policy of the Italian, the\r\nhome-bred simplicity of the German, and the Castilian propriety and\r\npoint of honor.[37] With the latter only of these had Philip anything in\r\ncommon. He was in everything a Spaniard. He talked of nothing, seemed to\r\nthink of nothing, but Spain.[38] The Netherlands were to him a foreign\r\nland, with which he had little sympathy. His counsellors and companions\r\nwere wholly Spanish. The people of Flanders felt, that, under his sway,\r\nlittle favor was to be shown to them; and they looked forward to the\r\ntime when all the offices of trust in their own country would be given\r\nto Castilians, in the same manner as those of Castile, in the early days\r\nof Charles the Fifth, had been given to Flemings.[39]\r\n\r\nYet the emperor seemed so little aware of his son's unpopularity, that\r\nhe was at this very time making arrangements for securing to him the\r\nimperial crown. He had summoned a meeting of the electors and great\r\nlords of the empire, to be held at Augsburg, in August, 1550. There he\r\nproposed to secure Philip's election as king of the Romans, so soon as\r\nhe had obtained his brother Ferdinand's surrender of that dignity. But\r\nCharles did not show, in all this, his usual knowledge of human nature.\r\nThe lust of power on his son's account--ineffectual for happiness as he\r\nhad found the possession of it in his own case--seems to have entirely\r\nblinded him.\r\n\r\nHe repaired with Philip to Augsburg, where they were met by Ferdinand\r\nand the members of the German diet. But it was in vain that Charles\r\nsolicited his brother to waive his claim to the imperial succession in\r\nfavor of his nephew. Neither solicitations nor arguments, backed by the\r\nentreaties, even the tears, it is said, of their common sister, the\r\nRegent Mary, could move Ferdinand to forego the splendid inheritance.\r\nCharles was not more successful when he changed his ground, and urged\r\nhis brother to acquiesce in Philip's election as his successor in the\r\ndignity of king of the Romans; or, at least, in his being associated in\r\nthat dignity--a thing unprecedented--with his cousin Maximilian,\r\nFerdinand's son, who, it was understood, was destined by the electors to\r\nsucceed his father.\r\n\r\nThis young prince, who meanwhile had been summoned to Augsburg, was as\r\nlittle disposed as Ferdinand had been to accede to the proposals of his\r\ntoo grasping father-in-law; though he courteously alleged, as the ground\r\nof his refusal, that he had no right to interfere with the decision of\r\nthe electors. He might safely rest his cause on their decision. They had\r\nno desire to perpetuate the imperial sceptre in the line of Castilian\r\nmonarchs. They had suffered enough from the despotic temper of Charles\r\nthe Fifth; and this temper they had no reason to think would be\r\nmitigated in the person of Philip.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AMBITIOUS SCHEMES.]\r\n\r\nThey desired a German to rule over them,--one who would understand the\r\nGerman character, and enter heartily into the feelings of the people.\r\nMaximilian's directness of purpose and kindly nature had won largely on\r\nthe affections of his countrymen, and proved him, in their judgment,\r\nworthy of the throne.[40]\r\n\r\nPhilip, on the other hand, was even more distasteful to the Germans than\r\nhe was to the Flemings. It was in vain that, at their banquets, he drank\r\ntwice or thrice as much as he was accustomed to do, until the cardinal\r\nof Trent assured him that he was fast gaining in the good graces of the\r\npeople.[41] The natural haughtiness of his temper showed itself on too\r\nmany occasions to be mistaken. When Charles returned to his palace,\r\nescorted, as he usually was, by a train of nobles and princes of the\r\nempire, he would courteously take them by the hand, and raise his hat,\r\nas he parted from them. But Philip, it was observed, on like occasions,\r\nwalked directly into the palace, without so much as turning round, or\r\ncondescending in any way to notice the courtiers who had accompanied\r\nhim. This was taking higher ground even than his father had done. In\r\nfact, it was said of him, that he considered himself greater than his\r\nfather, inasmuch as the son of an emperor was greater than the son of a\r\nking![42]--a foolish vaunt, not the less indicative of his character,\r\nthat it was made for him, probably, by the Germans. In short, Philip's\r\nmanners, which, in the language of a contemporary, had been little\r\npleasing to the Italians, and positively displeasing to the Flemings,\r\nwere altogether odious to the Germans.[43]\r\n\r\nNor was the idea of Philip's election at all more acceptable to the\r\nSpaniards themselves. That nation had been long enough regarded as an\r\nappendage to the empire. Their pride had been wounded by the light in\r\nwhich they were held by Charles, who seemed to look on Spain as a royal\r\ndomain, valuable chiefly for the means it afforded him for playing his\r\npart on the great theatre of Europe. The haughty Castilian of the\r\nsixteenth century, conscious of his superior pretensions, could ill\r\nbrook this abasement. He sighed for a prince born and bred in Spain, who\r\nwould be content to pass his life in Spain, and would have no ambition\r\nunconnected with her prosperity and glory. The Spaniards were even more\r\ntenacious on this head than the Germans. Their remote situation made\r\nthem more exclusive, mere strictly national, and less tolerant of\r\nforeign influence. They required a Spaniard to rule over them. Such was\r\nPhilip; and they anticipated the hour when Spain should be divorced from\r\nthe empire, and, under the sway of a patriotic prince, rise to her just\r\npreëminence among the nations.\r\n\r\nYet Charles, far from yielding, continued to press the point with such\r\npertinacity, that it seemed likely to lead to an open rupture between\r\nthe different branches of his family. For a time Ferdinand kept his\r\napartment, and had no intercourse with Charles or his sister.[44] Yet in\r\nthe end the genius or the obstinacy of Charles so far prevailed over\r\nhis brother, that he acquiesced in a private compact, by which, while he\r\nwas to retain possession of the imperial crown, it was agreed that\r\nPhilip should succeed him as king of the Romans, and that Maximilian\r\nshould succeed Philip.[45] Ferdinand hazarded little by concessions\r\nwhich could never be sanctioned by the electoral college. The reverses\r\nwhich befell the emperor's arms in the course of the following year\r\ndestroyed whatever influence he might have possessed in that body; and\r\nhe seems never to have revived his schemes for aggrandizing his son by\r\nsecuring to him the succession to the empire.\r\n\r\nPhilip had now accomplished the great object of his visit. He had\r\npresented himself to the people of the Netherlands, and had received\r\ntheir homage as heir to the realm. His tour had been, in some respects,\r\na profitable one. It was scarcely possible that a young man, whose days\r\nhad hitherto been passed within the narrow limits of his own country,\r\nfor ever under the same local influences, should not have his ideas\r\ngreatly enlarged by going abroad and mingling with different nations. It\r\nwas especially important to Philip to make himself familiar, as none but\r\na resident can be, with the character and institutions of those nations\r\nover whom he was one day to preside. Yet his visit to the Netherlands\r\nhad not been attended with the happiest results. He evidently did not\r\nmake a favorable impression on the people. The more they saw of him, the\r\nless they appeared to like him. Such impressions are usually reciprocal;\r\nand Philip seems to have parted from the country with little regret.\r\nThus, in the first interview between the future sovereign and his\r\nsubjects, the symptoms might already be discerned of that alienation\r\nwhich was afterwards to widen into a permanent and irreparable breach.\r\n\r\nPhilip, anxious to reach Castile, pushed forward his journey, without\r\nhalting to receive the civilities that were everywhere tendered to him\r\non his route. He made one exception at Trent, where the ecclesiastical\r\ncouncil was holding the memorable session that occupies so large a share\r\nin Church annals. On his approach to the city, the cardinal legate,\r\nattended by the mitred prelates and other dignitaries of the council,\r\ncame out in a body to receive him. During his stay there, he was\r\nentertained with masks, dancing, theatrical exhibitions, and jousts,\r\ncontrived to represent scenes in Ariosto.[46] These diversions of the\r\nreverend fathers formed a whimsical contrast, perhaps a welcome relief,\r\nto their solemn occupation of digesting a creed for the Christian world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONDITION OF SPAIN.]\r\n\r\nFrom Trent Philip pursued his way, with all expedition, to Genoa, where\r\nhe embarked, under the flag of the veteran Doria, who had brought him\r\nfrom Spain. He landed at Barcelona, on the twelfth day of July, 1551,\r\nand proceeded at once to Valladolid, where he resumed the government of\r\nthe kingdom. He was fortified by a letter from his father, dated at\r\nAugsburg, which contained ample instructions as to the policy he was to\r\npursue, and freely discussed both the foreign and domestic relations of\r\nthe country. The letter, which is very long, shows that the capacious\r\nmind of Charles, however little time he could personally give to the\r\naffairs of the monarchy, fully comprehended its internal condition and\r\nthe extent of its resources.[47]\r\n\r\nThe following years were years of humiliation to Charles; years marked\r\nby the flight from Innsbruck, and the disastrous siege of Metz,--when,\r\nbeaten by the Protestants, foiled by the French, the reverses of the\r\nemperor pressed heavily on his proud heart, and did more, probably, than\r\nall the homilies of his ghostly teachers, to disgust him with the world\r\nand its vanities.\r\n\r\nYet these reverses made little impression on Spain. The sounds of war\r\ndied away before they reached the foot of the Pyrenees. Spain, it is\r\ntrue, sent forth her sons, from time to time, to serve under the banners\r\nof Charles; and it was in that school that was perfected the admirable\r\nsystem of discipline and tactics which, begun by the Great Captain, made\r\nthe Spanish infantry the most redoubtable in Europe. But the great body\r\nof the people felt little interest in the success of these distant\r\nenterprises, where success brought them no good. Not that the mind of\r\nSpain was inactive, or oppressed with the lethargy which stole over it\r\nin a later age. There was, on the contrary, great intellectual activity.\r\nShe was excluded, by an arbitrary government, from pushing her\r\nspeculations in the regions of theological or political science. But\r\nthis, to a considerable extent, was the case with most of the\r\nneighboring nations; and she indemnified herself for this exclusion by a\r\nmore diligent cultivation of elegant literature. The constellation of\r\ngenius had already begun to show itself above the horizon, which was to\r\nshed a glory over the meridian and the close of Philip's reign. The\r\ncourtly poets in the reign of his father had confessed the influence of\r\nItalian models, derived through the recent territorial acquisitions in\r\nItaly. But the national taste was again asserting its supremacy; and the\r\nfashionable tone of composition was becoming more and more accommodated\r\nto the old Castilian standard.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible that any departure from a national standard\r\nshould be long tolerated in Spain, where the language, the manners, the\r\ndress, the usages of the country, were much the same as they had been\r\nfor generations,--as they continued to be for generations, long after\r\nCervantes held up the mirror of fiction, to reflect the traits of the\r\nnational existence more vividly than is permitted to the page of the\r\nchronicler. In the rude _romances_ of the fourteenth and the fifteenth\r\ncentury, the Castilian of the sixteenth might see his way of life\r\ndepicted with tolerable accuracy. The amorous cavalier still thrummed\r\nhis guitar, by moonlight, under the balcony of his mistress, or wore her\r\nfavors at the Moorish tilt of reeds. The common people still sung their\r\nlively _seguidillas_, or crowded to the _fiestas de toros_,--the cruel\r\nbull-fights,--or to the more cruel _autos da fé_. This last spectacle,\r\nof comparatively recent origin,--in the time of Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella,--was the legitimate consequence of the long wars with the\r\nMoslems, which made the Spaniard intolerant of religious infidelity.\r\nAtrocious as it seems in a more humane and enlightened age, it was\r\nregarded by the ancient Spaniard as a sacrifice grateful to Heaven, at\r\nwhich he was to rekindle the dormant embers of his own religious\r\nsensibilities.\r\n\r\nThe cessation of the long Moorish wars by the fall of Granada, made the\r\nmost important change in the condition of the Spaniards. They, however,\r\nfound a vent for their chivalrous fanaticism, in a crusade against the\r\nheathen of the New World. Those who returned from their wanderings\r\nbrought back to Spain little of foreign usages and manners; for the\r\nSpaniard was the only civilized man whom they found in the wilds of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThus passed the domestic life of the Spaniard, in the same unvaried\r\ncircle of habits, opinions, and prejudices, to the exclusion, and\r\nprobably contempt of everything foreign. Not that these habits did not\r\ndiffer in the different provinces, where their distinctive peculiarities\r\nwere handed down, with traditional precision, from father to son. But,\r\nbeneath these, there was one common basis of the national character.\r\nNever was there a people, probably, with the exception of the Jews,\r\ndistinguished by so intense a nationality. It was among such a people,\r\nand under such influences, that Philip was born and educated. His\r\ntemperament and his constitution of mind peculiarly fitted him for the\r\nreception of these influences; and the Spaniards, as he grew in years,\r\nbeheld, with pride and satisfaction, in their future sovereign, the most\r\nperfect type of the national character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nENGLISH ALLIANCE.\r\n\r\nCondition of England.--Character of Mary.--Philip's Proposals of\r\nMarriage.--Marriage Articles.--Insurrection in England.\r\n\r\n1553, 1554.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1553, three years after Philip's return to Spain,\r\noccurred an event which was to exercise a considerable influence on his\r\nfortunes. This was the death of Edward the Sixth of England,--after a\r\nbrief but important reign. He was succeeded by his sister Mary, that\r\nunfortunate princess, whose _sobriquet_ of \"Bloody\" gives her a\r\nmelancholy distinction among the sovereigns of the house of Tudor.\r\n\r\nThe reign of her father, Henry the Eighth, had opened the way to the\r\ngreat revolution in religion, the effects of which were destined to be\r\npermanent. Yet Henry himself showed his strength rather in unsettling\r\nancient institutions than in establishing new ones. By the abolition of\r\nthe monasteries, he broke up that spiritual militia which was a most\r\nefficacious instrument for maintaining the authority of Rome; and he\r\ncompleted the work of independence by seating himself boldly in the\r\nchair of St. Peter, and assuming the authority of head of the Church.\r\nThus, while the supremacy of the pope was rejected, the Roman Catholic\r\nreligion was maintained in its essential principles unimpaired. In other\r\nwords, the nation remained Catholics, but not Papists.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONDITION OF ENGLAND.]\r\n\r\nThe impulse thus given under Henry was followed up to more important\r\nconsequences under his son, Edward the Sixth. The opinions of the German\r\nReformers, considerably modified, especially in regard to the exterior\r\nforms and discipline of worship, met with a cordial welcome from the\r\nministers of the young monarch. Protestantism became the religion of the\r\nland; and the Church of England received, to a great extent, the\r\npeculiar organization which it has preserved to the present day. But\r\nEdward's reign was too brief to allow the new opinions to take deep root\r\nin the hearts of the people. The greater part of the aristocracy soon\r\nshowed that, whatever religious zeal they had affected, they were not\r\nprepared to make any sacrifice of their temporal interests. On the\r\naccession of a Catholic queen to the throne, a reaction soon became\r\nvisible. Some embarrassment to a return to the former faith was found in\r\nthe restitution which it might naturally involve of the confiscated\r\nproperty of the monastic orders. But the politic concessions of Rome\r\ndispensed with this severe trial of the sincerity of its new proselytes;\r\nand England, after repudiating her heresies, was received into the fold\r\nof the Roman Catholic Church, and placed once more under the\r\njurisdiction of its pontiff.\r\n\r\nAfter the specimens given of the ready ductility with which the English\r\nof that day accommodated their religious creeds to the creed of their\r\nsovereign, we shall hardly wonder at the caustic criticism of the\r\nVenetian ambassador, resident at the court of London, in Queen Mary's\r\ntime. \"The example and authority of the sovereign,\" he says, \"are\r\neverything with the people of this country in matters of faith. As he\r\nbelieves, they believe; Judaism or Mahometanism,--it is all one to them.\r\nThey conform themselves easily to his will, at least so far as the\r\noutward show is concerned; and most easily of all where it concurs with\r\ntheir own pleasure and profit.\"[48]\r\n\r\nThe ambassador, Giovanni Micheli, was one of that order of\r\nmerchant-princes employed by Venice in her foreign missions; men whose\r\nacquaintance with affairs enabled them to comprehend the resources of\r\nthe country to which they were sent, as well as the intrigues of its\r\ncourt. Their observations were digested into elaborate reports, which,\r\non their return to Venice, were publicly read before the doge and the\r\nsenate. The documents thus prepared form some of the most valuable and\r\nauthentic materials for the history of Europe in the sixteenth century.\r\nMicheli's report is diffuse on the condition of England under the reign\r\nof Queen Mary; and some of his remarks will have interest for the reader\r\nof the present day, as affording a standard of comparison with the\r\npast.[49]\r\n\r\nLondon he eulogizes, as one of the noblest capitals in Europe,\r\ncontaining, with its suburbs, about a hundred and eighty thousand\r\nsouls.[50] The great lords, as in France and Germany, passed most of\r\ntheir time on their estates in the country.\r\n\r\nThe kingdom was strong enough, if united, to defy any invasion from\r\nabroad. Yet its navy was small, having dwindled, from neglect and an\r\nill-judged economy, to not more than forty vessels of war. But the\r\nmercantile marine could furnish two thousand more, which, at a short\r\nnotice, could be well equipped and got ready for sea. The army was\r\nparticularly strong in artillery, and provided with all the munitions of\r\nwar. The weapon chiefly in repute was the bow, to which the English\r\npeople were trained from early youth. In their cavalry they were most\r\ndefective. Horses were abundant, but wanted bottom. They were, for the\r\nmost part, light, weak, and grass-fed.[51] The nation was, above all, to\r\nbe envied for the lightness of the public burdens. There were no taxes\r\non wine, beer, salt, cloth, nor, indeed, on any of the articles that in\r\nother countries furnished the greatest sources of revenue.[52] The whole\r\nrevenue did not usually exceed two hundred thousand pounds. Parliaments\r\nwere rarely summoned, except to save the king trouble or to afford a\r\ncloak to his designs. No one ventured to resist the royal will; servile\r\nthe members came there, and servile they remained.[53]--An Englishman of\r\nthe nineteenth century may smile at the contrast presented by some of\r\nthese remarks to the condition of the nation at the present day; though\r\nin the item of taxation the contrast may be rather fitted to provoke a\r\nsigh.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Queen Mary is given by the Venetian minister, with a\r\ncoloring somewhat different from that in which she is commonly depicted\r\nby English historians. She was about thirty-six years of age at the time\r\nof her accession. In stature, she was of rather less than the middle\r\nsize,--not large, as was the case with both her father and mother,--and\r\nexceedingly well made. \"The portraits of her,\" says Micheli, \"show that\r\nin her youth she must have been not only good-looking, but even\r\nhandsome;--though her countenance, when he saw her, exhibited traces of\r\nearly trouble and disease.\"[54] But whatever she had lost in personal\r\nattractions was fully made up by those of the mind. She was quick of\r\napprehension, and, like her younger sister, Elizabeth, was mistress of\r\nseveral languages, three of which, the French, Spanish, and Latin, she\r\ncould speak; the last with fluency.[55] But in these accomplishments she\r\nwas surpassed by her sister, who knew the Greek well, and could speak\r\nItalian with ease and elegance. Mary, however, both spoke and wrote her\r\nown language in a plain, straightforward manner, that forms a contrast\r\nto the ambiguous phrase and cold conceits in which Elizabeth usually\r\nconveyed, or rather concealed, her sentiments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHARACTER OF MARY.]\r\n\r\nMary had the misfortune to labour under a chronic infirmity, which\r\nconfined her for weeks, and indeed months, of every year to her chamber,\r\nand which, with her domestic troubles, gave her an air of melancholy,\r\nthat in later years settled into a repulsive austerity. The tones of her\r\nvoice were masculine, says the Venetian, and her eyes inspired a\r\nfeeling, not merely of reverence, but of fear, wherever she turned them.\r\nHer spirit he adds, was lofty and magnanimous, never discomposed by\r\ndanger, showing in all things a blood truly royal.[56]\r\n\r\nHer piety, he continues, and her patience under affliction, cannot be\r\ntoo greatly admired. Sustained, as she was, by a lively faith and\r\nconscious innocence, he compares her to a light which the fierce winds\r\nhave no power to extinguish, but which still shines on with increasing\r\nlustre.[57] She waited her time, and was plainly reserved by Providence\r\nfor a great destiny.--We are reading the language of the loyal Catholic,\r\ngrateful for the services which Mary had rendered to the faith.\r\n\r\nYet it would be uncharitable not to believe that Mary was devout, and\r\nmost earnest in her devotion. The daughter of Katharine of Aragon, the\r\ngranddaughter of Isabella of Castile, could hardly have been otherwise.\r\nThe women of that royal line were uniformly conspicuous for their piety,\r\nthough this was too often tinctured with bigotry. In Mary, bigotry\r\ndegenerated into fanaticism, and fanaticism into the spirit of\r\npersecution. The worst evils are probably those that have flowed from\r\nfanaticism. Yet the amount of the mischief does not necessarily furnish\r\nus with the measure of guilt in the author of it. The introduction of\r\nthe Inquisition into Spain must be mainly charged on Isabella. Yet the\r\nstudent of her reign will not refuse to this great queen the praise of\r\ntenderness of conscience and a sincere desire to do the right.\r\nUnhappily, the faith in which she, as well as her royal granddaughter,\r\nwas nurtured, taught her to place her conscience in the keeping of\r\nministers less scrupulous than herself; and on those ministers may\r\nfairly rest much of the responsibility of measures on which they only\r\nwere deemed competent to determine.\r\n\r\nMary's sincerity in her religious professions was placed beyond a doubt\r\nby the readiness with which she submitted to the sacrifice of her\r\npersonal interests whenever the interests of religion seemed to demand\r\nit. She burned her translation of a portion of Erasmus, prepared with\r\ngreat labor, at the suggestion of her confessor. An author will readily\r\nestimate the value of such a sacrifice. One more important, and\r\nintelligible to all, was the resolute manner in which she persisted in\r\nrestoring the Church property which had been confiscated to the use of\r\nthe crown. \"The crown is too much impoverished to admit of it,\"\r\nremonstrated her ministers. \"I would rather lose ten crowns,\" replied\r\nthe high-minded queen, \"than place my soul in peril.\"[58]\r\n\r\nYet it cannot be denied, that Mary had inherited, in full measure, some\r\nof the sterner qualities of her father, and that she was wanting in that\r\nsympathy for human suffering which is so graceful in a woman. After a\r\nrebellion, the reprisals were terrible. London was converted into a\r\ncharnel-house; and the squares and principal streets were garnished with\r\nthe unsightly trophies of the heads and limbs of numerous victims who\r\nhad fallen by the hand of the executioner.[59] This was in accordance\r\nwith the spirit of the age. But the execution of the unfortunate Lady\r\nJane Grey--the young, the beautiful, and the good--leaves a blot on the\r\nfame of Mary, which finds no parallel but in the treatment of the\r\nill-fated queen of Scots by Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nMary's treatment of Elizabeth has formed another subject of reproach,\r\nthough the grounds of it are not sufficiently made out; and, at all\r\nevents, many circumstances may be alleged in extenuation of her conduct.\r\nShe had seen her mother, the noble-minded Katharine, exposed to the most\r\ncruel indignities, and compelled to surrender her bed and her throne to\r\nan artful rival, the mother of Elizabeth. She had heard herself declared\r\nillegitimate, and her right to the succession set aside in favor of her\r\nyounger sister. Even after her intrepid conduct had secured to her the\r\ncrown, she was still haunted by the same gloomy apparition. Elizabeth's\r\npretensions were constantly brought before the public; and Mary might\r\nwell be alarmed by the disclosure of conspiracy after conspiracy, the\r\nobject of which, it was rumored, was to seat her sister on the throne.\r\nAs she advanced in years, Mary had the further mortification of seeing\r\nher rival gain on those affections of the people which had grown cool to\r\nher. Was it wonderful that she should regard her sister, under these\r\ncircumstances, with feelings of distrust and aversion? That she did so\r\nregard her is asserted by the Venetian minister; and it is plain that,\r\nduring the first years of Mary's reign, Elizabeth's life hung upon a\r\nthread. Yet Mary had strength of principle sufficient to resist the\r\nimportunities of Charles the Fifth and his ambassador, to take the life\r\nof Elizabeth, as a thing indispensable to her own safety and that of\r\nPhilip. Although her sister was shown to be privy, though not openly\r\naccessory, to the grand rebellion under Wyatt, Mary would not constrain\r\nthe law from its course to do her violence. This was something, under\r\nthe existing circumstances, in an age so unscrupulous. After this storm\r\nhad passed over, Mary, whatever restraint she imposed on her real\r\nfeelings, treated Elizabeth, for the most part, with a show of kindness,\r\nthough her name still continued to be mingled, whether with or without\r\ncause, with more than one treasonable plot.[60] Mary's last act--perhaps\r\nthe only one in which she openly resisted the will of her husband--was\r\nto refuse to compel her sister to accept the hand of Philibert of Savoy.\r\nYet this act would have relieved her of the presence of her rival; and\r\nby it Elizabeth would have forfeited her independent possession of the\r\ncrown,--perhaps the possession of it altogether. It may be doubted\r\nwhether Elizabeth, under similar circumstances, would have shown the\r\nlike tenderness to the interests of her successor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PHILIP'S PROPOSALS OF MARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\nBut, however we may be disposed to extenuate the conduct of Mary, and in\r\nspiritual matters, more especially, to transfer the responsibility of\r\nher acts from herself to her advisers, it is not possible to dwell on\r\nthis reign of religious persecution without feelings of profound\r\nsadness. Not that the number of victims compares with what is recorded\r\nof many similar periods of persecution. The whole amount, falling\r\nprobably short of three hundred who perished at the stake, was less than\r\nthe number who fell by the hand of the executioner, or by violence,\r\nduring the same length of time under Henry the Eighth. It was not much\r\ngreater than might sometimes be found at a single Spanish _auto da fé_.\r\nBut Spain was the land in which this might be regarded as the national\r\nspectacle,--as much so as the _fiesta de toros_, or any other of the\r\npopular exhibitions of the country. In England, a few examples had not\r\nsufficed to steel the hearts of men against these horrors. The heroic\r\ncompany of martyrs, condemned to the most agonizing of deaths for\r\nasserting the rights of conscience, was a sight strange and shocking to\r\nEnglishmen. The feelings of that day have been perpetuated to the\r\npresent. The reign of religious persecution stands out by itself, as\r\nsomething distinct from the natural course of events; and the fires of\r\nSmithfield shed a melancholy radiance over this page of the national\r\nhistory, from which the eye of humanity turns away in pity and\r\ndisgust.--But it is time to take up the narrative of events which\r\nconnected for a brief space the political interests of Spain with those\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nCharles the Fifth had always taken a lively interest in the fortunes of\r\nhis royal kinswoman. When a young man he had paid a visit to England,\r\nand while there had been induced by his aunt, Queen Katharine, to\r\ncontract a marriage with the Princess Mary,--then only six years\r\nold,--to be solemnized on her arriving at the suitable age. But the term\r\nwas too remote for the constancy of Charles, or, as it is said, for the\r\npatience of his subjects, who earnestly wished to see their sovereign\r\nwedded to a princess who might present him with an heir to the monarchy.\r\nThe English match was, accordingly, broken off, and the young emperor\r\ngave his hand to Isabella of Portugal.[61]\r\n\r\nMary, who, since her betrothal, had been taught to consider herself as\r\nthe future bride of the emperor, was at the time but eleven years old.\r\nShe was old enough, however, to feel something like jealousy, it is\r\nsaid, and to show some pique at this desertion by her imperial lover.\r\nYet this circumstance did not prevent the most friendly relations from\r\nsubsisting between the parties in after years; and Charles continued to\r\nwatch over the interests of his kinswoman, and interposed, with good\r\neffect, in her behalf, on more than one occasion, both during the reign\r\nof Henry the Eighth and of his son, Edward the Sixth. On the death of\r\nthe latter monarch, he declared himself ready to assist Mary in\r\nmaintaining her right to the succession;[62] and, when this was finally\r\nestablished, the wary emperor took the necessary measures for turning it\r\nto his own account.[63]\r\n\r\nHe formed a scheme for uniting Philip with Mary, and thus securing to\r\nhis son the possession of the English crown, in the same manner as that\r\nof Scotland had been secured by marriage to the son of his rival, Henry\r\nthe Second of France. It was, doubtless, a great error to attempt to\r\nbring under one rule nations so dissimilar in every particular, and\r\nhaving interests so incompatible as the Spaniards and the English.\r\nHistorians have regarded it as passing strange, that a prince, who had\r\nhad such large experience of the difficulties attending the government\r\nof kingdoms remote from each other, should seek so to multiply these\r\ndifficulties on the head of his inexperienced son. But the love of\r\nacquisition is a universal principle; nor is it often found that the\r\nappetite for more is abated by the consideration that the party is\r\nalready possessed of more then he can manage.\r\n\r\nIt was a common opinion, that Mary intended to bestow her hand on her\r\nyoung and handsome kinsman, Courtenay, earl of Devonshire, whom she had\r\nwithdrawn from the prison in which he had languished for many years, and\r\nafterwards treated with distinguished favor. Charles, aware of this,\r\ninstructed Renard, his minister at the court of London, a crafty,\r\nintriguing politician,[64] to sound the queen's inclinations on the\r\nsubject, but so as not to alarm her. He was to dwell, particularly, on\r\nthe advantages Mary would derive from a connection with some powerful\r\nforeign prince, and to offer his master's counsel, in this or any other\r\nmatter in which she might desire it. The minister was to approach the\r\nsubject of the earl of Devonshire with the greatest caution; remembering\r\nthat, if the queen had a fancy for her cousin, and was like other women,\r\nshe would not be turned from it by anything that he might say, nor would\r\nshe readily forgive any reflection upon it.[65] Charles seems to have\r\nbeen as well read in the characters of women as of men; and, as a\r\nnatural consequence, it may be added, had formed a high estimate of the\r\ncapacity of the sex. In proof of which, he not only repeatedly\r\ncommitted the government of his states to women, but intrusted them\r\nwith some of his most delicate political negotiations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PHILIP'S PROPOSALS OF MARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\nMary, if she had ever entertained the views imputed to her in respect to\r\nCourtenay, must have soon been convinced that his frivolous disposition\r\nwould ill suit the seriousness of hers. However this may be, she was\r\ngreatly pleased when Renard hinted at her marriage,--\"laughing,\" says\r\nthe envoy, \"not once, but several times, and giving me a significant\r\nlook, which showed that the idea was very agreeable to her, plainly\r\nintimating at the same time that she had no desire to marry an\r\nEnglishman.\"[66] In a subsequent conversation, when Renard ventured to\r\nsuggest that the prince of Spain was a suitable match, Mary broke in\r\nupon him, saying that \"she had never felt the smart of what people\r\ncalled love, nor had ever so much as thought of being married, until\r\nProvidence had raised her to the throne; and that, if she now consented\r\nto it, it would be in opposition to her own feelings, from a regard to\r\nthe public good;\" but she begged the envoy to assure the emperor of her\r\nwish to obey and to please him in everything, as she would her own\r\nfather; intimating, however, that she could not broach the subject of\r\nher marriage to her council; the question could only be opened by a\r\ncommunication from him.[67]\r\n\r\nCharles, who readily saw through Mary's coquetry, no longer hesitated to\r\nprefer the suit of Philip. After commending the queen's course in regard\r\nto Courtenay, he presented to her the advantages that must arise from\r\nsuch a foreign alliance as would strengthen her on the throne. He\r\ndeclared, in a tone of gallantry rather amusing, that, if it were not\r\nfor his age and increasing infirmities, he should not hesitate to\r\npropose himself as her suitor.[68] The next best thing was to offer her\r\nthe person dearest to his heart,--his son, the prince of Asturias. He\r\nconcluded by deprecating the idea that any recommendation of his should\r\ninterfere, in the least degree, with the exercise of her better\r\njudgment.[69]\r\n\r\nRenard was further to intimate to the queen the importance of secrecy in\r\nregard to this negotiation. If she were disinclined to the proposed\r\nmatch, it would be obviously of no advantage to give it publicity. If,\r\non the other hand, as the emperor had little doubt, she looked on it\r\nfavorably, but desired to advise with her council before deciding,\r\nRenard was to dissuade her from the latter step, and advise her to\r\nconfide in him.[70] The wary emperor had a twofold motive for these\r\ninstructions. There was a negotiation on foot at this very time for a\r\nmarriage of Philip to the infanta of Portugal, and Charles wished to be\r\nentirely assured of Mary's acquiescence, before giving such publicity to\r\nthe affair as might defeat the Portuguese match, which would still\r\nremain for Philip, should he not succeed with the English queen.[71] In\r\ncase Mary proved favorable to his son's suit, Charles, who knew the\r\nabhorrence in which foreigners were held by the English beyond all other\r\nnations,[72] wished to gain time before communicating with Mary's\r\ncouncil. With some delay, he had no doubt that he had the means of\r\nwinning over a sufficient number of that body to support Philip's\r\npretensions.[73]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PHILIP'S PROPOSALS OF MARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\nThese communications could not be carried on so secretly but that some\r\nrumor of them reached the ears of Mary's ministers, and of Noailles, the\r\nFrench ambassador at the court of London.[74] This person was a busy\r\nand unscrupulous politician, who saw with alarm the prospect of Spain\r\nstrengthening herself by this alliance with England, and determined,\r\naccordingly, in obedience to instructions from home, to use every effort\r\nto defeat it. The queen's ministers, with the chancellor, Gardiner,\r\nbishop of Winchester, at their head, felt a similar repugnance to the\r\nSpanish match. The name of the Spaniards had become terrible from the\r\nremorseless manner in which their wars had been conducted during the\r\npresent reign, especially in the New World. The ambition and the\r\nwidely-extended dominions of Charles the Fifth made him the most\r\nformidable sovereign in Europe. The English looked with apprehension on\r\nso close an alliance with a prince who had shown too little regard for\r\nthe liberties of his own land to make it probable that he or his son\r\nwould respect those of another. Above all, they dreaded the fanaticism\r\nof the Spaniards; and the gloomy spectre of the Inquisition moving in\r\ntheir train made even the good Catholic shudder at the thought of the\r\nmiseries that might ensue from this ill-omened union.\r\n\r\nIt was not difficult for Noailles and the chancellor to communicate\r\ntheir own distrust to the members of the parliament, then in session. A\r\npetition to the queen was voted in the lower house, in which the commons\r\npreferred an humble request that she would marry for the good of the\r\nrealm, but besought her, at the same time, not to go abroad for her\r\nhusband, but to select him among her own subjects.[75]\r\n\r\nMary's ministers did not understand her character so well as Charles the\r\nFifth did, when he cautioned his agent not openly to thwart her.\r\nOpposition only fixed her more strongly in her original purpose. In a\r\nprivate interview with Renard, she told him that she was apprised of\r\nGardiner's intrigues, and that Noailles, too, was _doing the impossible_\r\nto prevent her union with Philip. \"But I will be a match for them,\" she\r\nadded. Soon after, taking the ambassador, at midnight, into her oratory,\r\nshe knelt before the host, and, having repeated the hymn _Veni Creator_,\r\nsolemnly pledged herself to take no other man for her husband than the\r\nprince of Spain.[76]\r\n\r\nThis proceeding took place on the thirtieth of October. On the\r\nseventeenth of the month following, the commons waited on the queen at\r\nher palace of Whitehall, to which she was confined by indisposition, and\r\npresented their address. Mary, instead of replying by her chancellor, as\r\nwas usual, answered them in person. She told them, that from God she\r\nheld her crown, and that to him alone should she turn for counsel in a\r\nmatter so important;[77] she had not yet made up her mind to marry; but\r\nsince they considered it so necessary for the weal of the kingdom, she\r\nwould take it into consideration. It was a matter in which no one was so\r\nmuch interested as herself. But they might be assured that, in her\r\nchoice, she would have regard to the happiness of her people, full as\r\nmuch as to her own. The commons, who had rarely the courage to withstand\r\nthe frown of their Tudor princes, professed themselves contented with\r\nthis assurance; and, from this moment, opposition ceased from that\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nMary's arguments were reinforced by more conciliatory, but not less\r\nefficacious persuasives, in the form of gold crowns, gold chains, and\r\nother compliments of the like nature, which were distributed pretty\r\nliberally by the Spanish ambassador among the members of her\r\ncouncil.[78]\r\n\r\nIn the following December, a solemn embassy left Brussels, to wait on\r\nMary and tender her the hand of Philip. It was headed by Lamoral, Count\r\nEgmont, the Flemish noble so distinguished in later years by his\r\nmilitary achievements, and still more by his misfortunes. He was\r\nattended by a number of Flemish lords and a splendid body of retainers.\r\nHe landed in Kent, where the rumor went abroad that it was Philip\r\nhimself; and so general was the detestation of the Spanish match among\r\nthe people, that it might have gone hard with the envoy, had the mistake\r\nnot been discovered. Egmont sailed up the Thames, and went ashore at\r\nTower Wharf, on the second of January, 1554. He was received with all\r\nhonor by Lord William Howard and several of the great English nobles,\r\nand escorted in much state to Westminster, where his table was supplied\r\nat the charge of the city. Gardiner entertained the embassy at a\r\nsumptuous banquet; and the next day Egmont and his retinue proceeded to\r\nHampton Court, \"where they had great cheer,\" says an old chronicler,\r\n\"and hunted the deer, and were so greedy of their destruction, that they\r\ngave them not fair play for their lives; for,\" as he peevishly\r\ncomplains, \"they killed rag and tag, with hands and swords.\"[79]\r\n\r\nOn the twelfth, the Flemish count was presented to the queen, and\r\ntendered her proposals of marriage in behalf of Prince Philip. Mary, who\r\nprobably thought she had made advances enough, now assumed a more\r\nreserved air. \"It was not for a maiden queen,\" she said, \"thus publicly\r\nto enter on so delicate a subject as her own marriage. This would be\r\nbetter done by her ministers, to whom she would refer him. But this she\r\nwould have him understand,\" she added, as she cast her eyes on the ring\r\non her finger, \"her realm was her first husband, and none other should\r\ninduce her to violate the oath which she had pledged at her coronation.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARRIAGE ARTICLES.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this prudery of Mary, she had already manifested such a\r\nprepossession for her intended lord as to attract the notice of her\r\ncourtiers, one of whom refers it to the influence of a portrait of\r\nPhilip, of which she had become \"greatly enamored.\"[80] That such a\r\npicture was sent to her appears from a letter of Philip's aunt, the\r\nregent of the Netherlands, in which she tells the English queen that she\r\nhas sent her a portrait of the prince, from the pencil of Titian, which\r\nshe was to return so soon as she was in possession of the living\r\noriginal. It had been taken some three years before, she said, and was\r\nesteemed a good likeness, though it would be necessary, as in the case\r\nof other portraits by this master, to look at it from a distance in\r\norder to see the resemblance.[81]\r\n\r\nThe marriage treaty was drawn up with great circumspection, under the\r\nchancellor's direction. It will be necessary to notice only the most\r\nimportant provisions. It was stipulated that Philip should respect the\r\nlaws of England, and leave every man in the full enjoyment of his rights\r\nand immunities. The power of conferring titles, honors, emoluments, and\r\noffices of every description, was to be reserved to the queen.\r\nForeigners were to be excluded from office. The issue of the marriage,\r\nif a son, was to succeed to the English crown and to the Spanish\r\npossessions in Burgundy and the Low Countries. But in case of the death\r\nof Don Carlos, Philip's son, the issue of the present marriage was to\r\nreceive, in addition to the former inheritance, Spain and her\r\ndependencies. The queen was never to leave her own kingdom without her\r\nexpress desire. Her children were not to be taken out of it without the\r\nconsent of the nobles. In case of Mary's death, Philip was not to claim\r\nthe right of taking part in the government of the country. Further it\r\nwas provided that Philip should not entangle the nation in his wars with\r\nFrance, but should strive to maintain the same amicable relations that\r\nnow subsisted between the two countries.[82]\r\n\r\nSuch were the cautious stipulations of this treaty, which had more the\r\naspect of a treaty for defence against an enemy than a marriage\r\ncontract. The instrument was worded with a care that reflected credit on\r\nthe sagacity of its framers. All was done that parchment could do to\r\nsecure the independence of the crown, as well as the liberties of the\r\npeople. \"But if the bond be violated,\" asked one of the parliamentary\r\nspeakers on the occasion, \"who is there to sue the bond?\" Every\r\nreflecting Englishman must have felt the inefficacy of any guaranty that\r\ncould be extorted from Philip, who, once united to Mary, would find\r\nlittle difficulty in persuading a fond and obedient wife to sanction his\r\nown policy, prejudicial though it might be to the true interests of the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the marriage treaty made public, than the popular\r\ndiscontent, before partially disclosed, showed itself openly throughout\r\nthe country. Placards were put up, lampoons were written, reviling the\r\nqueen's ministers and ridiculing the Spaniards; ominous voices were\r\nheard from old, dilapidated buildings, boding the ruin of the monarchy.\r\nEven the children became infected with the passions of their fathers.\r\nGames were played in which the English were represented contending with\r\nthe Spaniards; and in one of these an unlucky urchin, who played the\r\npart of Philip, narrowly escaped with his life from the hands of his\r\nexasperated comrades.[83]\r\n\r\nBut something more serious than child's play showed itself, in three\r\nseveral insurrections which broke out in different quarters of the\r\nkingdom. The most formidable of them was the one led by Sir Thomas\r\nWyatt, son of the celebrated poet of that name. It soon gathered head,\r\nand the number of the insurgents was greatly augmented by the accession\r\nof a considerable body of the royal forces, who deserted their colours,\r\nand joined the very men against whom they had been sent. Thus\r\nstrengthened, Wyatt marched on London. All there were filled with\r\nconsternation,--all but their intrepid queen, who showed as much\r\nself-possession and indifference to danger as if it were only an\r\nordinary riot.\r\n\r\nProceeding at once into the city, she met the people at Guildhall, and\r\nmade them a spirited address, which has been preserved in the pages of\r\nHolinshed. It concludes in the following bold strain, containing an\r\nallusion to the cause of the difficulties:--\"And certainly, if I did\r\neither know or think that this marriage should either turn to the danger\r\nor loss of any of you, my loving subjects, or to the detriment or\r\nimpairing of any part or parcel of the royal estate of this realm of\r\nEngland, I would never consent thereunto, neither would I ever marry\r\nwhile I lived. And on the word of a queen, I promise and assure you,\r\nthat, if it shall not probably appear before the nobility and commons,\r\nin the high court of parliament, that this marriage shall be for the\r\nsingular benefit and commodity of all the whole realm, that then I will\r\nabstain, not only from this marriage, but also from any other whereof\r\nperil may ensue to this most noble realm. Wherefore now as good and\r\nfaithful subjects pluck up your hearts, and like true men stand fast\r\nwith your lawful prince against these rebels, both our enemies and\r\nyours, and fear them not; for I assure you that I fear them nothing at\r\nall!\"[84] The courageous spirit of their queen communicated itself to\r\nher audience, and in a few hours twenty thousand citizens enrolled\r\nthemselves under the royal banner.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the rebel force continued its march, and reports soon came\r\nthat Wyatt was on the opposite bank of the Thames; then, that he had\r\ncrossed the river. Soon his presence was announced by the flight of a\r\ngood number of the royalists, among whom was Courtenay, who rode off\r\nbefore the enemy at a speed that did little credit to his valor. All was\r\nnow confusion again. The lords and ladies in attendance gathered round\r\nthe queen in Whitehall, as if to seek support from her more masculine\r\nnature. Her ministers went down on their knees, to implore her to seek\r\nrefuge in the Tower, as the only place of safety. Mary smiled with\r\ncontempt at the pusillanimous proposal, and resolved to remain where she\r\nwas, and abide the issue.\r\n\r\nIt was not long in coming. Wyatt penetrated as far as Ludgate, with\r\ndesperate courage, but was not well seconded by his followers. The few\r\nwho proved faithful were surrounded and overwhelmed by numbers. Wyatt\r\nwas made prisoner, and the whole rebel rout discomfited and dispersed.\r\nBy this triumph over her enemies, Mary was seated more strongly than\r\never on the throne. Henceforward the Spanish match did not meet with\r\nopposition from the people, any more than from the parliament.\r\n\r\nStill the emperor, after this serious demonstration of hostility to his\r\nson, felt a natural disquietude in regard to his personal safety, which\r\nmade him desirous of obtaining some positive guaranty before trusting\r\nhim among the turbulent islanders. He wrote to his ambassador to require\r\nsuch security from the government. But no better could be given than the\r\nroyal promise that everything should be done to insure the prince's\r\nsafety. Renard was much perplexed. He felt the responsibility of his own\r\nposition. He declined to pledge himself for the quiet deportment of the\r\nEnglish; but he thought matters had already gone too far to leave it in\r\nthe power of Spain to recede.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARY'S BETROTHAL.]\r\n\r\nHe wrote, moreover, both to Charles and to Philip, recommending that the\r\nprince should not bring over with him a larger retinue of Spaniards than\r\nwas necessary, and that the wives of his nobles--for he seems to have\r\nregarded the sex as the source of evil--should not accompany them.[85]\r\nAbove all, he urged Philip and his followers to lay aside the Castilian\r\n_hauteur_, and to substitute the conciliatory manners which might disarm\r\nthe jealousy of the English.[86]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nENGLISH ALLIANCE.\r\n\r\nMary's Betrothal.--Joanna Regent of Castile.--Philip embarks for\r\nEngland.--His splendid Reception.--Marriage of Philip and Mary.--Royal\r\nEntertainments.--Philip's Influence.--The Catholic Church\r\nrestored.--Philip's Departure.\r\n\r\n1554, 1555.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the month of March, 1554, Count Egmont arrived in England, on a\r\nsecond embassy, for the purpose of exchanging the ratifications of the\r\nmarriage treaty. He came in the same state as before, and was received\r\nby the queen in the presence of her council. The ceremony was conducted\r\nwith great solemnity. Mary, kneeling down, called God to witness, that,\r\nin contracting this marriage, she had been influenced by no motive of a\r\ncarnal or worldly nature, but by the desire of securing the welfare and\r\ntranquillity of the kingdom. To her kingdom her faith had first been\r\nplighted; and she hoped that Heaven would give her strength to maintain\r\ninviolate the oath she had taken at her coronation.\r\n\r\nThis she said with so much grace, that the bystanders, says Renard,--who\r\nwas one of them,--were all moved to tears. The ratifications were then\r\nexchanged, and the oaths taken, in presence of the host, by the\r\nrepresentatives of Spain and England; when Mary, again kneeling, called\r\non those present to unite with her in prayer to the Almighty, that he\r\nwould enable her faithfully to keep the articles of the treaty, and\r\nwould make her marriage a happy one.\r\n\r\nCount Egmont then presented to the queen a diamond ring which the\r\nemperor had sent her. Mary, putting it on her finger, showed it to the\r\ncompany; \"and assuredly,\" exclaims the Spanish minister, \"the jewel was\r\na precious one, and well worthy of admiration.\" Egmont, before departing\r\nfor Spain, inquired of Mary whether she would intrust him with any\r\nmessage to Prince Philip. The queen replied, that \"he might tender to\r\nthe prince her most affectionate regards, and assure him that she should\r\nbe always ready to vie with him in such offices of kindness as became a\r\nloving and obedient wife.\" When asked if she would write to him, she\r\nanswered, \"Not till he had begun the correspondence.\"[87]\r\n\r\nThis lets us into the knowledge of a little fact, very significant. Up\r\nto this time Philip had neither written, nor so much as sent a single\r\ntoken of regard to his mistress. All this had been left to his father.\r\nCharles had arranged the marriage, had wooed the bride, had won over her\r\nprincipal advisers,--in short, had done all the courtship. Indeed, the\r\ninclinations of Philip, it is said, had taken another direction, and he\r\nwould have preferred the hand of his royal kinswoman, Mary of\r\nPortugal.[88] However this may be, it is not probable that he felt any\r\ngreat satisfaction in the prospect of being united to a woman who was\r\neleven years older than himself, and whose personal charms, whatever\r\nthey might once have been, had long since faded, under the effects of\r\ndisease and a constitutional melancholy. But he loved power; and\r\nwhatever scruples he might have entertained on his own account were\r\nsilenced before the wishes of his father.[89] \"Like another Isaac,\"\r\nexclaims Sandoval, in admiration of his conduct, \"he sacrificed himself\r\non the altar of filial duty.\"[90] The same implicit deference which\r\nPhilip showed his father in this delicate matter, he afterwards, under\r\nsimilar circumstances, received from his own son.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARY'S BETROTHAL.]\r\n\r\nAfter the marriage articles had been ratified, Philip sent a present of\r\na magnificent jewel to the English queen, by a Spanish noble of high\r\nrank, the Marquis de las Nayas.[91] The marquis, who crossed from Biscay\r\nwith a squadron of four ships, landed at Plymouth, and, as he journeyed\r\ntowards London, was met by the young Lord Herbert, son of the earl of\r\nPembroke, who conducted him, with an escort of four hundred mounted\r\ngentlemen, to his family seat in Wiltshire. \"And as they rode together\r\nto Wilton,\" says Lord Edmund Dudley, one of the party, \"there were\r\ncertain courses at the hare, which was so pleasant that the marquis much\r\ndelighted in finding the course so readily appointed. As for the\r\nmarquis's great cheer, as well that night at supper as otherwise at his\r\nbreakfast the next day, surely it was so abundant, that it was not a\r\nlittle marvel to consider that so great a preparation could be made in\r\nso small a warning.... Surely it was not a little comfort to my heart\r\nto see all things so honorably used for the honor and service of the\r\nqueen's majesty.\"[92]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Philip was making his arrangements for leaving Spain, and\r\nproviding a government for the country during his absence. It was\r\ndecided by the emperor to intrust the regency to his daughter, the\r\nPrincess Joanna. She was eight years younger than Philip. About eighteen\r\nmonths before, she had gone to Portugal as the bride of the heir of that\r\nkingdom. But the fair promise afforded by this union was blasted by the\r\nuntimely death of her consort, which took place on the second of\r\nJanuary, 1554. Three weeks afterwards, the unhappy widow gave birth to a\r\nson, the famous Don Sebastian, whose Quixotic adventures have given him\r\na wider celebrity than is enjoyed by many a wiser sovereign. After the\r\ncruel calamity which had befallen her, it was not without an effort that\r\nJoanna resigned herself to her father's wishes, and consented to enter\r\non the duties of public life. In July, she quitted Lisbon,--the scene of\r\nearly joys, and of hopes for ever blighted,--and, amidst the regrets of\r\nthe whole court, returned, under a princely escort, to Castile. She was\r\nreceived on the borders by the king, her brother, who conducted her to\r\nValladolid. Here she was installed, with due solemnity, in her office of\r\nregent. A council of state was associated with her in the government. It\r\nconsisted of persons of the highest consideration, with the archbishop\r\nof Seville at their head. By this body Joanna was to be advised, and\r\nindeed to be guided in all matters of moment. Philip, on his departure,\r\nleft his sister an ample letter of instructions as to the policy to be\r\npursued by the administration, especially in affairs of religion.[93]\r\n\r\nJoanna seems to have been a woman of discretion and virtue,--qualities\r\nwhich belonged to the females of her line. She was liberal in her\r\nbenefactions to convents and colleges; and their cloistered inmates\r\nshowed their gratitude by the most lavish testimony to her deserts. She\r\nhad one rather singular practice. She was in the habit of dropping her\r\nveil, when giving audience to foreign ambassadors. To prevent all doubts\r\nas to her personal identity, she began the audience by raising her veil,\r\nsaying, \"Am I not the princess?\" She then again covered her face, and\r\nthe conference was continued without her further exposing her features.\r\n\"It was not necessary,\" says her biographer, in an accommodating spirit,\r\n\"to have the face uncovered in order to hear.\"[94] Perhaps Joanna\r\nconsidered this reserve as suited to the season of her mourning,\r\nintending it as a mark of respect to the memory of her deceased lord. In\r\nany other view, we might suspect that there entered into her\r\nconstitution a vein of the same madness which darkened so large a part\r\nof the life of her grandmother and namesake, Joanna of Castile.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Valladolid, Philip formed a separate establishment for\r\nhis son, Don Carlos, and placed his education under the care of a\r\npreceptor, Luis de Vives, a scholar not to be confounded with his\r\nnamesake, the learned tutor of Mary of England. Having completed his\r\narrangements, Philip set out for the place of his embarkation in the\r\nnorth. At Compostella he passed some days, offering up his devotions to\r\nthe tutelar saint of Spain, whose shrine, throughout the Middle Ages,\r\nhad been the most popular resort of pilgrims from the western parts of\r\nChristendom.\r\n\r\nWhile at Compostella, Philip subscribed the marriage treaty, which had\r\nbeen brought over from England by the earl of Bedford. He then proceeded\r\nto Corunna, where a fleet of more than a hundred sail was riding at\r\nanchor, in readiness to receive him. It was commanded by the admiral of\r\nCastile, and had on board, besides its complement of seamen, four\r\nthousand of the best troops of Spain. On the eleventh of July, Philip\r\nembarked, with his numerous retinue, in which, together with the Flemish\r\nCounts Egmont and Hoorne, were to be seen the dukes of Alva and Medina\r\nCoeli, the prince of Eboli,--in short, the flower of the Castilian\r\nnobility. They came attended by their wives and vassals, minstrels and\r\nmummers, and a host of idle followers, to add to the splendor of the\r\npageant and do honor to their royal master. Yet the Spanish ambassador\r\nat London had expressly recommended to Philip that his courtiers should\r\nleave their ladies at home, and should come in as simple guise as\r\npossible, so as not to arouse the jealousy of the English.[95]\r\n\r\nAfter a pleasant run of a few days, the Spanish squadron came in sight\r\nof the combined fleets of England and Flanders, under the command of the\r\nLord Admiral Howard, who was cruising in the channel in order to meet\r\nthe prince and convoy him to the English shore. The admiral seems to\r\nhave been a blunt sort of man, who spoke his mind with more candor than\r\ncourtesy. He greatly offended the Flemings by comparing their ships to\r\nmuscle-shells.[96] He is even said to have fired a gun as he approached\r\nPhilip's squadron, in order to compel it to lower its topsails in\r\nacknowledgment of the supremacy of the English in the \"narrow seas.\" But\r\nthis is probably the patriotic vaunt of an English writer, since it is\r\nscarcely possible that the haughty Spaniard of that day would have made\r\nsuch a concession, and still less so that the British commander would\r\nhave been so discourteous as to exact it on this occasion.\r\n\r\nOn the nineteenth of July, the fleets came to anchor in the port of\r\nSouthampton. A number of barges were soon seen pushing off from the\r\nshore; one of which, protected by a rich awning and superbly lined with\r\ncloth of gold, was manned by sailors, whose dress of white and green\r\nintimated the royal livery. It was the queen's barge, intended for\r\nPhilip; while the other boats, all gaily ornamented, received his nobles\r\nand their retinues.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PHILIP'S SPLENDID RECEPTION.]\r\n\r\nThe Spanish prince was welcomed, on landing, by a goodly company of\r\nEnglish lords, assembled to pay him their obeisance. The earl of Arundel\r\npresented him, in the queen's name, with the splendid insignia of the\r\norder of the Garter.[97] Philip's dress, as usual, was of plain black\r\nvelvet, with a berret cap, ornamented, after the fashion of the time,\r\nwith gold chains. By Mary's orders, a spirited Andalusian jennet had\r\nbeen provided for him, which the prince instantly mounted. He was a good\r\nrider, and pleased the people by his courteous bearing, and the graceful\r\nmanner in which he managed his horse.\r\n\r\nThe royal procession then moved forward to the ancient church of the\r\nHoly Rood, where mass was said, and thanks were offered up for their\r\nprosperous voyage. Philip, after this, repaired to the quarters assigned\r\nto him during his stay in the town. They were sumptuously fitted up, and\r\nthe walls of the principal apartment hung with arras, commemorating the\r\ndoings of that royal polemic, Henry the Eighth. Among other inscriptions\r\nin honor of him might be seen one proclaiming him \"Head of the Church,\"\r\nand \"Defender of the Faith;\"--words which, as they were probably in\r\nLatin, could not have been lost on the Spaniards.[98]\r\n\r\nThe news of Philip's landing was received in London with every\r\ndemonstration of joy. Guns were fired, bells were rung, processions were\r\nmade to the churches, bonfires were lighted in all the principal\r\nstreets, tables were spread in the squares laden with good cheer, and\r\nwine and ale flowed freely as water for all comers.[99] In short, the\r\ncity gave itself up to a general jubilee, as if it were celebrating some\r\nvictorious monarch returned to his dominions, and not the man whose name\r\nhad lately been the object of such general execration. Mary gave instant\r\norders that the nobles of her court should hold themselves in readiness\r\nto accompany her to Winchester, where she was to receive the prince; and\r\non the twenty-first of July she made her entry, in great state, into\r\nthat capital, and established her residence in the episcopal palace.\r\n\r\nDuring the few days that Philip stayed at Southampton, he rode\r\nconstantly abroad, and showed himself frequently to the people. The\r\ninformation he had received, before his voyage, of the state of public\r\nfeeling, had suggested to him some natural apprehensions for his safety.\r\nHe seems to have resolved, from the first, therefore, to adopt such a\r\ncondescending, and indeed affable demeanor, as would disarm the jealousy\r\nof the English, and if possible conciliate their good-will. In this he\r\nappears to have been very successful, although some of the more haughty\r\nof the aristocracy did take exception at his neglecting to raise his cap\r\nto them. That he should have imposed the degree of restraint which he\r\nseems to have done on the indulgence of his natural disposition, is good\r\nproof of the strength of his apprehensions.[100]\r\n\r\nThe favor which Philip showed the English gave umbrage to his own\r\nnobles. They were still more disgusted by the rigid interpretation of\r\none of the marriage articles, by which some hundreds of their attendants\r\nwere prohibited, as foreigners, from landing, or, after landing, were\r\ncompelled to reembark, and return to Spain.[101] Whenever Philip went\r\nabroad he was accompanied by Englishmen. He was served by Englishmen at\r\nhis meals. He breakfasted and dined in public, a thing but little to his\r\ntaste. He drank healths, after the manner of the English, and encouraged\r\nhis Spanish followers to imitate his example, as he quaffed the strong\r\nale of the country.[102]\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-third of the month, the earl of Pembroke arrived, with a\r\nbrilliant company of two hundred mounted gentlemen, to escort the prince\r\nto Winchester. He was attended, moreover, by a body of English archers,\r\nwhose tunics of yellow cloth, striped with bars of red velvet, displayed\r\nthe gaudy-colored livery of the house of Aragon. The day was\r\nunpropitious. The rain fell heavily, in such torrents as might have\r\ncooled the enthusiasm of a more ardent lover than Philip. But he was too\r\ngallant a cavalier to be daunted by the elements. The distance, not\r\ngreat in itself, was to be travelled on horseback,--the usual mode of\r\nconveyance at a time when roads were scarcely practicable for carriages.\r\n\r\nPhilip and his retinue had not proceeded far, when they were encountered\r\nby a cavalier, riding at full speed, and bringing with him a ring which\r\nMary had sent her lover, with the request that he would not expose\r\nhimself to the weather, but postpone his departure to the following day.\r\nThe prince, not understanding the messenger, who spoke in English, and\r\nsuspecting that it was intended by Mary to warn him of some danger in\r\nhis path, instantly drew up by the road-side, and took counsel with Alva\r\nand Egmont as to what was to be done. One of the courtiers, who\r\nperceived his embarrassment, rode up and acquainted the prince with the\r\nreal purport of the message. Relieved of his alarm, Philip no longer\r\nhesitated, but, with his red felt cloak wrapped closely about him and a\r\nbroad beaver slouched over his eyes, manfully pushed forward, in spite\r\nof the tempest.\r\n\r\nAs he advanced, his retinue received continual accessions from the\r\nneighboring gentry and yeomanry, until it amounted to some thousands\r\nbefore he reached Winchester. It was late in the afternoon when the\r\ncavalcade, soiled with travel and thoroughly drenched with rain, arrived\r\nbefore the gates of the city. The mayor and aldermen, dressed in their\r\nrobes of scarlet, came to welcome the prince, and, presenting the keys\r\nof the city, conducted him to his quarters.\r\n\r\nThat evening Philip had his first interview with Mary. It was private,\r\nand he was taken to her residence by the chancellor, Gardiner, bishop of\r\nWinchester. The royal pair passed an hour or more together; and, as Mary\r\nspoke the Castilian fluently, the interview must have been spared much\r\nof the embarrassment that would otherwise have attended it.[103]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARRIAGE OF PHILIP AND MARY.]\r\n\r\nOn the following day the parties met in public. Philip was attended by\r\nthe principal persons of his suite, of both sexes; and as the\r\nprocession, making a goodly show, passed through the streets on foot,\r\nthe minstrelsy played before them till they reached the royal residence.\r\nThe reception-room was the great hall of the palace. Mary, stepping\r\nforward to receive her betrothed, saluted him with a loving kiss before\r\nall the company. She then conducted him to a sort of throne, where she\r\ntook her seat by his side, under a stately canopy. They remained there\r\nfor an hour or more, conversing together, while their courtiers had\r\nleisure to become acquainted with one another, and to find ample food,\r\ndoubtless, for future criticism, in the peculiarities of national\r\ncostume and manners. Notwithstanding the Spanish blood in Mary's veins,\r\nthe higher circles of Spain and England had personally almost as little\r\nintercourse with one another at that period, as England and Japan have\r\nat the present.\r\n\r\nThe ensuing day, the festival of St. James, the patron saint of Spain,\r\nwas the one appointed for the marriage. Philip exchanged his usual\r\nsimple dress for the bridal vestments provided for him by his mistress.\r\nThey were of spotless white, as the reporter is careful to inform us,\r\nsatin and cloth of gold, thickly powdered with pearls and precious\r\nstones. Round his neck he wore the superb collar of the Golden Fleece,\r\nthe famous Burgundian order; while the brilliant riband below his knee\r\nserved as the badge of the no less illustrious order of the Garter. He\r\nwent on foot to the cathedral, attended by all his nobles, vying with\r\none another in the ostentatious splendor of their retinues.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour elapsed before Philip was joined by the queen at the\r\nentrance of the cathedral. Mary was surrounded by the lords and ladies\r\nof her court. Her dress, of white satin and cloth of gold, like his own,\r\nwas studded and fringed with diamonds of inestimable price, some of\r\nthem, doubtless, the gift of Philip, which he had sent to her by the\r\nhands of the prince of Eboli, soon after his landing. Her bright-red\r\nslippers, and her mantle of black velvet, formed a contrast to the rest\r\nof her apparel, and, for a bridal costume, would hardly suit the taste\r\nof the present day. The royal party then moved up the nave of the\r\ncathedral, and were received in the choir by the bishop of Winchester,\r\nsupported by the great prelates of the English Church. The greatest of\r\nall, Cranmer, the primate of all England, who should have performed the\r\nceremony, was absent,--in disgrace and a prisoner.\r\n\r\nPhilip and Mary took their seats under a royal canopy, with an altar\r\nbetween them. The queen was surrounded by the ladies of her court; whose\r\nbeauty, says an Italian writer, acquired additional lustre by contrast\r\nwith the shadowy complexions of the south.[104] The aisles and spacious\r\ngalleries were crowded with spectators of every degree, drawn together\r\nfrom the most distant quarters to witness the ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe silence was broken by Figueroa, one of the imperial council, who\r\nread aloud an instrument of the emperor, Charles the Fifth. It stated\r\nthat this marriage had been of his own seeking; and he was desirous that\r\nhis beloved son should enter into it in a manner suitable to his own\r\nexpectations and the dignity of his illustrious consort. He therefore\r\nresigned to him his entire right and sovereignty over the kingdom of\r\nNaples and the duchy of Milan. The rank of the parties would thus be\r\nequal, and Mary, instead of giving her hand to a subject, would wed a\r\nsovereign like herself.\r\n\r\nSome embarrassment occurred as to the person who should give the queen\r\naway,--a part of the ceremony not provided for. After a brief\r\nconference, it was removed by the marquis of Winchester and the earls of\r\nPembroke and Derby, who took it on themselves to give her away in the\r\nname of the whole realm; at which the multitude raised a shout that made\r\nthe old walls of the cathedral ring again. The marriage service was then\r\nconcluded by the bishop of Winchester. Philip and Mary resumed their\r\nseats, and mass was performed, when the bridegroom, rising, gave his\r\nconsort the \"kiss of peace,\" according to the custom of the time. The\r\nwhole ceremony occupied nearly four hours. At the close of it Philip,\r\ntaking Mary by the hand, led her from the church. The royal couple were\r\nfollowed by the long train of prelates and nobles, and were preceded by\r\nthe earls of Pembroke and Derby, each bearing aloft a naked sword, the\r\nsymbol of sovereignty. The effect of the spectacle was heightened by the\r\nvarious costumes of the two nations,--the richly-tinted and picturesque\r\ndresses of the Spaniards, and the solid magnificence of the English and\r\nFlemings, mingling together in gay confusion. The glittering procession\r\nmoved slowly on, to the blithe sounds of festal music, while the air was\r\nrent with the loyal acclamations of the populace, delighted, as usual,\r\nwith the splendor of the pageant.\r\n\r\nIn the great hall of the episcopal palace, a sumptuous banquet was\r\nprepared for the whole company. At one end of the apartment was a dais,\r\non which, under a superb canopy, a table was set for the king and queen;\r\nand a third seat was added for Bishop Gardiner, the only one of the\r\ngreat lords who was admitted to the distinction of dining with royalty.\r\n\r\nBelow the dais, the tables were set on either side through the whole\r\nlength of the hall, for the English and Spanish nobles, all arranged--a\r\nperilous point of etiquette--with due regard to their relative rank. The\r\nroyal table was covered with dishes of gold. A spacious beaufet, rising\r\nto the height of eight stages, or shelves, and filled with a profusion\r\nof gold and silver vessels, somewhat ostentatiously displayed the\r\nmagnificence of the prelate, or of his sovereign. Yet this ostentation\r\nwas rather Spanish than English; and was one of the forms in which the\r\nCastilian grandee loved to display his opulence.[105]\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the hall was an orchestra, occupied by a band of\r\nexcellent performers, who enlivened the repast by their music. But the\r\nmost interesting part of the show was that of the Winchester boys, some\r\nof whom were permitted to enter the presence, and recite in Latin their\r\nepithalamiums in honor of the royal nuptials, for which they received a\r\nhandsome guerdon from the queen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROYAL ENTERTAINMENTS.]\r\n\r\nAfter the banquet came the ball, at which, if we are to take an old\r\nEnglish authority, \"the Spaniards were greatly out of countenance when\r\nthey saw the English so far excel them.\"[106] This seems somewhat\r\nstrange, considering that dancing is, and always has been, the national\r\npastime of Spain. Dancing is to the Spaniard what music is to the\r\nItalian,--the very condition of his social existence.[107] It did not\r\ncontinue late on the present occasion, and, at the temperate hour of\r\nnine, the bridal festivities closed for the evening.[108]\r\n\r\nPhilip and Mary passed a few days in this merry way of life, at\r\nWinchester, whence they removed, with their court, to Windsor. Here a\r\nchapter of the order of the Garter was held, for the purpose of\r\ninstalling King Philip. The herald, on this occasion, ventured to take\r\ndown the arms of England, and substitute those of Spain, in honor of the\r\nnew sovereign,--an act of deference which roused the indignation of the\r\nEnglish lords, who straightway compelled the functionary to restore the\r\nnational escutcheon to its proper place.[109]\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-eighth of August, Philip and Mary made their public entry\r\ninto London. They rode in on horseback, passing through the borough of\r\nSouthwark, across London Bridge. Every preparation was made by the loyal\r\ncitizens to give them a suitable reception. The columns of the buildings\r\nwere festooned with flowers, triumphal arches spanned the streets, the\r\nwalls were hung with pictures or emblazoned with legends in\r\ncommemoration of the illustrious pair, and a genealogy was traced for\r\nPhilip, setting forth his descent from John of Gaunt,--making him out,\r\nin short, as much of an Englishman as possible.\r\n\r\nAmong the paintings was one in which Henry the Eighth was seen holding\r\nin his hand a Bible. This device gave great scandal to the chancellor,\r\nGardiner, who called the painter sundry hard names, rating him roundly\r\nfor putting into King Harry's hand the sacred volume, which should\r\nrather have been given to his daughter, Queen Mary, for her zeal to\r\nrestore the primitive worship of the Church. The unlucky artist lost no\r\ntime in repairing his error by brushing out the offending volume, and\r\ndid it so effectually, that he brushed out the royal fingers with it,\r\nleaving the old monarch's mutilated stump held up, like some poor\r\nmendicant's, to excite the compassion of the spectators.[110]\r\n\r\nBut the sight which, more than all these pageants, gave joy to the\r\nhearts of the Londoners, was an immense quantity of bullion, which\r\nPhilip caused to be paraded through the city on its way to the Tower,\r\nwhere it was deposited in the royal treasury. The quantity was said to\r\nbe so great, that, on one occasion, the chests containing it filled\r\ntwenty carts. On another, two wagons were so heavily laden with the\r\nprecious metal as to require to be drawn by nearly a hundred\r\nhorses.[111] The good people, who had looked to the coming of the\r\nSpaniards as that of a swarm of locusts which was to consume their\r\nsubstance, were greatly pleased to see their exhausted coffers so well\r\nreplenished from the American mines.\r\n\r\nFrom London the royal pair proceeded to the shady solitudes of Hampton\r\nCourt, and Philip, weary of the mummeries in which he had been compelled\r\nto take part, availed himself of the indisposition of his wife to\r\nindulge in that retirement and repose which were more congenial to his\r\ntaste. This way of life in his pleasant retreat, however, does not\r\nappear to have been so well suited to the taste of his English subjects.\r\nAt least, an old chronicler peevishly complains that \"the hall-door\r\nwithin the court was continually shut, so that no man might enter unless\r\nhis errand were first known; which seemed strange to Englishmen that had\r\nnot been used thereto.\"[112]\r\n\r\nYet Philip, although his apprehensions for his safety had doubtless\r\nsubsided, was wise enough to affect the same conciliatory manners as on\r\nhis first landing,--and not altogether in vain. \"He discovered,\" says\r\nthe Venetian ambassador, in his report to the senate, \"none of that\r\n_sosiego_--the haughty indifference of the Spaniards--which\r\ndistinguished him when he first left home for Italy and Flanders.[113]\r\nHe was, indeed, as accessible as any one could desire, and gave patient\r\naudience to all who asked it. He was solicitous,\" continues Micheli, \"to\r\ninstruct himself in affairs, and showed a taste for application to\r\nbusiness,\"--which, it may be added, grew stronger with years. \"He spoke\r\nlittle. But his remarks, though brief, were pertinent. In short,\" he\r\nconcludes, \"he is a prince of an excellent genius, a lively\r\napprehension, and a judgment ripe beyond his age.\"\r\n\r\nPhilip's love of business, however, was not such as to lead him to take\r\npart prematurely in the management of affairs. He discreetly left this\r\nto the queen and her ministers, to whose judgment he affected to pay the\r\ngreatest deference. He particularly avoided all appearance of an attempt\r\nto interfere with the administration of justice, unless it were to\r\nobtain some act of grace. Such interference only served to gain him the\r\nmore credit with the people.[114]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PHILIP'S INFLUENCE.]\r\n\r\nThat he gained largely on their good-will may be inferred from the\r\ncasual remarks of more than one contemporary writer. They bear emphatic\r\ntestimony to the affability of his manners, so little to have been\r\nexpected from the popular reports of his character. \"Among other\r\nthings,\" writes Wotton, the English minister at the French court, \"one I\r\nhave been right glad to hear of is, that the king's highness useth\r\nhimself so gently and lovingly to all men. For, to tell you the truth, I\r\nhave heard some say, that, when he came out of Spain into Italy, it was\r\nby some men wished that he had showed a somewhat more benign countenance\r\nto the people than it was said he then did.\"[115] Another contemporary,\r\nin a private letter, written soon after the king's entrance into London,\r\nafter describing his person as \"so well proportioned that Nature cannot\r\nwork a more perfect pattern,\" concludes with commending him for his\r\n\"pregnant wit and most gentle nature.\"[116]\r\n\r\nPhilip, from the hour of his landing, had been constant in all his\r\nreligious observances. \"He was as punctual,\" says Micheli, \"in his\r\nattendance at mass, and his observance of all the forms of devotion, as\r\nany monk;--more so, as some people thought, than became his age and\r\nstation. The ecclesiastics,\" he adds, \"with whom Philip had constant\r\nintercourse, talked loudly of his piety.\"[117]\r\n\r\nYet there was no hypocrisy in this. However willing Philip may have been\r\nthat his concern for the interests of religion might be seen of men, it\r\nis no less true that, as far as he understood these interests, his\r\nconcern was perfectly sincere. The actual state of England may have even\r\noperated as an inducement with him to overcome his scruples as to the\r\nconnection with Mary. \"Better not reign at all,\" he often remarked,\r\n\"than reign over heretics.\" But what triumph more glorious than that of\r\nconverting these heretics, and bringing them back again into the bosom\r\nof the Church? He was most anxious to prepare the minds of his new\r\nsubjects for an honorable reception of the papal legate, Cardinal Pole,\r\nwho was armed with full authority to receive the submission of England\r\nto the Holy See. He employed his personal influence with the great\r\nnobles, and enforced it occasionally by liberal drafts on those Peruvian\r\ningots which he had sent to the Tower. At least, it is asserted that he\r\ngave away yearly pensions, to the large amount of between fifty and\r\nsixty thousand gold crowns, to sundry of the queen's ministers. It was\r\ndone on the general plea of recompensing their loyalty to their\r\nmistress.[118]\r\n\r\nEarly in November, tidings arrived of the landing of Pole. He had been\r\ndetained some weeks in Germany, by the emperor, who felt some\r\ndistrust--not ill-founded, as it seems--of the cardinal's disposition in\r\nregard to the Spanish match. Now that this difficulty was obviated, he\r\nwas allowed to resume his journey. He came up the Thames in a\r\nmagnificent barge, with a large silver cross, the emblem of his legatine\r\nauthority, displayed on the prow. The legate, on landing, was received\r\nby the king, the queen, and the whole court, with a reverential\r\ndeference which argued well for the success of his mission.\r\n\r\nHe was the man, of all others, best qualified to execute it. To a\r\nnatural kindness of temper he united an urbanity and a refinement of\r\nmanners, derived from familiar intercourse with the most polished\r\nsociety of Europe, his royal descent entitled him to mix on terms of\r\nequality with persons of the highest rank, and made him feel as much at\r\nease in the court as in the cloister. His long exile had opened to him\r\nan acquaintance with man as he is found in various climes, while, as a\r\nnative-born Englishman, he perfectly understood the prejudices and\r\npeculiar temper of his own countrymen. \"Cardinal Pole,\" says the\r\nVenetian minister, \"is a man of unblemished nobility, and so strict in\r\nhis integrity, that he grants nothing to the importunity of friends. He\r\nis so much beloved, both by prince and people, that he may well be\r\nstyled the king where all is done by his authority.\"[119] An English\r\ncardinal was not of too frequent occurrence in the sacred college. That\r\none should have been found at the present juncture, with personal\r\nqualities, moreover, so well suited to the delicate mission to England,\r\nwas a coincidence so remarkable, that Philip and Mary might well be\r\nexcused for discerning in it the finger of Providence.\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth of the month, parliament, owing to the queen's\r\nindisposition, met at Whitehall; and Pole made that celebrated speech in\r\nwhich he recapitulated some of the leading events of his own life, and\r\nthe persecutions he had endured for conscience' sake. He reviewed the\r\nchanges in religion which had taken place in England, and implored his\r\naudience to abjure their spiritual errors, and to seek a reconciliation\r\nwith the Catholic Church. He assured them of his plenary power to grant\r\nabsolution for the past; and--what was no less important--to authorize\r\nthe present proprietors to retain possession of the abbey lands which\r\nhad been confiscated under King Henry. This last concession, which had\r\nbeen extorted with difficulty from the pope, reconciling, as it did,\r\ntemporal with spiritual interests, seems to have dispelled whatever\r\nscruples yet lingered in the breasts of the legislature. There were few,\r\nprobably, in that goodly company, whose zeal would have aspired to the\r\ncrown of martyrdom.\r\n\r\nThe ensuing day, parliament, in obedience to the royal summons, again\r\nassembled at Whitehall. Philip took his seat on the left of Mary, under\r\nthe same canopy, while Cardinal Pole sat at a greater distance on her\r\nright.[120]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE CATHOLIC CHURCH RESTORED.]\r\n\r\nThe chancellor, Gardiner, then presented a petition in the name of the\r\nlords and commons, praying for reconciliation with the papal see.\r\nAbsolution was solemnly pronounced by the legate, and the whole assembly\r\nreceived his benediction on their bended knees. England, purified from\r\nher heresy, was once more restored to the communion of the Roman\r\nCatholic Church.\r\n\r\nPhilip instantly despatched couriers, with the glad tidings, to Rome,\r\nBrussels, and other capitals of Christendom. Everywhere the event was\r\ncelebrated with public rejoicings, as if it had been some great victory\r\nover the Saracens. As Philip's zeal for the faith was well known, and as\r\nthe great change had taken place soon after his arrival in England, much\r\nof the credit of it was ascribed to him.[121] Thus, before ascending the\r\nthrone of Spain, he had vindicated his claim to the title of Catholic,\r\nso much prized by the Spanish monarchs. He had won a triumph greater\r\nthan that which his father had been able to win after years of war, over\r\nthe Protestants of Germany; greater than any which had been won by the\r\narms of Cortés or Pizarro in the New World. Their contest had been with\r\nthe barbarian; the field of Philip's labors was one of the most potent\r\nand civilized countries of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe work of conversion was speedily followed by that of persecution. To\r\nwhat extent Philip's influence was exerted in this is not manifest.\r\nIndeed, from anything that appears, it would not be easy to decide\r\nwhether his influence was employed to promote or to prevent it. One fact\r\nis certain, that, immediately after the first martyrs suffered at\r\nSmithfield, Alfonso de Castro, a Spanish friar, preached a sermon in\r\nwhich he bitterly inveighed against these proceedings. He denounced them\r\nas repugnant to the true spirit of Christianity, which was that of\r\ncharity and forgiveness, and which enjoined its ministers not to take\r\nvengeance on the sinner, but to enlighten him as to his errors, and\r\nbring him to repentance.[122] This bold appeal had its effect, even in\r\nthat season of excitement. For a few weeks the arm of persecution seemed\r\nto be palsied. But it was only for a few weeks. Toleration was not the\r\nvirtue of the sixteenth century. The charitable doctrines of the good\r\nfriar fell on hearts withered by fanaticism; and the spirit of\r\nintolerance soon rekindled the fires of Smithfield into a fiercer glow\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\nYet men wondered at the source whence these strange doctrines had\r\nproceeded. The friar was Philip's confessor. It was argued that he would\r\nnot have dared to speak thus boldly, had it not been by the command of\r\nPhilip, or, at least, by his consent. That De Castro should have thus\r\nacted at the suggestion of his master is contradicted by the whole tenor\r\nof Philip's life. Hardly four years elapsed before he countenanced by\r\nhis presence an _auto da fé_ in Valladolid, where fourteen persons\r\nperished at the stake; and the burning of heretics in England could have\r\ndone no greater violence to his feelings than the burning of heretics in\r\nSpain. If the friar did indeed act in obedience to Philip, we may well\r\nsuspect that the latter was influenced less by motives of humanity than\r\nof policy; and that the disgust manifested by the people at the\r\nspectacle of these executions may have led him to employ this expedient\r\nto relieve himself of any share in the odium which attached to\r\nthem.[123]\r\n\r\nWhat was the real amount of Philip's influence, in this or other\r\nmatters, it is not possible to determine. It is clear that he was\r\ncareful not to arouse the jealousy of the English by any parade of\r\nit.[124] One obvious channel of it lay in the queen, who seems to have\r\ndoated on him with a fondness that one would hardly have thought a\r\ntemper cold and repulsive, like that of Philip, capable of exciting. But\r\nhe was young and good-looking. His manners had always been found to\r\nplease the sex, even where he had not been so solicitous to please as he\r\nwas in England. He was Mary's first and only love; for the emperor was\r\ntoo old to have touched aught but her vanity, and Courtenay was too\r\nfrivolous to have excited any other than a temporary feeling. This\r\ndevotion to Philip, according to some accounts, was ill requited by his\r\ngallantries. The Venetian ambassador says of him, that \"he well deserved\r\nthe tenderness of his wife, for he was the most loving and the best of\r\nhusbands.\" But it seems probable that the Italian, in his estimate of\r\nthe best of husbands, adopted the liberal standard of his own\r\ncountry.[125]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PHILIP'S INFLUENCE.]\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of November, parliament was advised that the queen was\r\nin a state of pregnancy. The intelligence was received with the joy\r\nusually manifested by loyal subjects on like occasions. The emperor\r\nseems to have been particularly pleased with this prospect of an heir,\r\nwho, by the terms of the marriage treaty, would make a division of that\r\ngreat empire which it had been the object of its master's life to build\r\nup and consolidate under one sceptre. The commons, soon after, passed an\r\nact empowering Philip, in case it should go otherwise than well with the\r\nqueen at the time of her confinement, to assume the regency, and take\r\ncharge of the education of her child during its minority. The regency\r\nwas to be limited by the provisions of the marriage treaty. But the act\r\nmay be deemed evidence that Philip had gained on the confidence of his\r\nnew subjects.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms continued to be favorable; and, as the time approached for\r\nMary's confinement, messengers were held in readiness to bear the\r\ntidings to the different courts. The loyal wishes of the people ran so\r\nfar ahead of reality, that the rumor went abroad of the actual birth of\r\na prince. Bells were rung, bonfires lighted; _Te Deum_ was sung in some\r\nof the churches; and one of the preachers \"took upon him to describe the\r\nproportions of the child, how fair, how beautiful and great a prince it\r\nwas, as the like had not been seen!\" \"But for all this great labor,\"\r\nsays the caustic chronicler, \"for their yoong maister long looked for\r\ncoming so surely into the world, in the end appeared neither yoong\r\nmaister nor yoong maistress, that any man to this day can hear of.\"[126]\r\n\r\nThe queen's disorder proved to be a dropsy. But, notwithstanding the\r\nmortifying results of so many prognostics and preparations, and the\r\nridicule which attached to it, Mary still cherished the illusion of one\r\nday giving an heir to the crown. Her husband did not share in this\r\nillusion; and, as he became convinced that she had no longer prospect of\r\nissue, he found less inducement to protract his residence in a country\r\nwhich, on many accounts, was most distasteful to him. Whatever show of\r\ndeference might be paid to him, his haughty spirit could not be pleased\r\nby the subordinate part which he was compelled to play, in public, to\r\nthe queen. The parliament had never so far acceded to Mary's wishes as\r\nto consent to his coronation as king of England. Whatever weight he may\r\nhave had in the cabinet, it had not been such as to enable him to make\r\nthe politics of England subservient to his own interests, or, what was\r\nthe same thing, to those of his father. Parliament would not consent to\r\nswerve so far from the express provisions of the marriage treaty as to\r\nbecome a party in the emperor's contest with France.[127]\r\n\r\nNor could the restraint constantly imposed on Philip, by his desire to\r\naccommodate himself to the tastes and habits of the English, be\r\notherwise than irksome to him. If he had been more successful in this\r\nthan might have been expected, yet it was not possible to overcome the\r\nprejudices, the settled antipathy, with which the Spaniards were\r\nregarded by the great mass of the people, as was evident from the\r\nsatirical shafts, which, from time to time, were launched by\r\npamphleteers and ballad-makers, both against the king and his followers.\r\n\r\nThese latter were even more impatient than their master of their stay in\r\na country where they met with so many subjects of annoyance. If a\r\nSpaniard bought anything, complains one of the nation, he was sure to be\r\ncharged an exorbitant price for it.[128] If he had a quarrel with an\r\nEnglishman, says another writer, he was to be tried by English law, and\r\nwas very certain to come off the worst.[129] Whether right or wrong, the\r\nSpaniards could hardly fail to find abundant cause of irritation and\r\ndisgust. The two nations were too dissimilar for either of them to\r\ncomprehend the other. It was with no little satisfaction, therefore,\r\nthat Philip's followers learned that their master had received a summons\r\nfrom his father to leave England, and join him in Flanders.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this sudden movement was one that filled the Castilians, as\r\nit did all Europe, with astonishment,--the proposed abdication of\r\nCharles the Fifth. It was one that might seem to admit of neither doubt\r\nnor delay on Philip's part. But Mary, distressed by the prospect of\r\nseparation, prevailed on her husband to postpone his departure for\r\nseveral weeks. She yielded, at length, to the necessity of the case.\r\nPreparations were made for Philip's journey, and Mary, with a heavy\r\nheart, accompanied her royal consort down the Thames to Greenwich. Here\r\nthey parted; and Philip, taking an affectionate farewell, and commending\r\nthe queen and her concerns to the care of Cardinal Pole, took the road\r\nto Dover.\r\n\r\nAfter a short detention there by contrary winds, he crossed over to\r\nCalais, and on the fourth of September made his entry into that strong\r\nplace, the last remnant of all their continental acquisitions that still\r\nbelonged to the English.\r\n\r\nPhilip was received by the authorities of the city with the honors due\r\nto his rank. He passed some days there receiving the respectful\r\ncourtesies of the inhabitants, and, on his departure, rejoiced the\r\nhearts of the garrison by distributing among them a thousand crowns of\r\ngold. He resumed his journey, with his splendid train of Castilian and\r\nEnglish nobles, among whom were the earls of Arundel, Pembroke,\r\nHuntington, and others of the highest station in the realm. On the road,\r\nhe was met by a military escort sent by his father; and towards the\r\nlatter part of September, 1555, Philip, with his gallant retinue, made\r\nhis entry into the Flemish capital, where the emperor and his court were\r\neagerly awaiting his arrival.[130]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EMPIRE OF PHILIP]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWAR WITH THE POPE.\r\n\r\nEmpire of Philip.--Paul the Fourth.--Court of France.--League against\r\nSpain.--The Duke of Alva.--Preparations for War.--Victorious Campaign.\r\n\r\n1555, 1556.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after Philip's arrival in Brussels took place that memorable scene\r\nof the abdication of Charles the Fifth, which occupies the introductory\r\npages of our narrative. By this event, Philip saw himself master of the\r\nmost widely extended and powerful monarchy in Europe. He was king of\r\nSpain, comprehending under that name Castile, Aragon, and Granada,\r\nwhich, after surviving as independent states for centuries, had been\r\nfirst brought under one sceptre in the reign of his father, Charles the\r\nFifth. He was king of Naples and Sicily, and duke of Milan, which\r\nimportant possessions enabled him to control, to a great extent, the\r\nnicely balanced scales of Italian politics. He was lord of Franche\r\nComté, and of the Low Countries, comprehending the most flourishing and\r\npopulous provinces in Christendom, whose people had made the greatest\r\nprogress in commerce, husbandry, and the various mechanic arts. As\r\ntitular king of England, he eventually obtained an influence, which, as\r\nwe shall see, enabled him to direct the counsels of that country to his\r\nown purposes. In Africa he possessed the Cape de Verd Islands and the\r\nCanaries, as well as Tunis, Oran, and some other important places on the\r\nBarbary coast. He owned the Philippines and the Spice Islands in Asia.\r\nIn America, besides his possessions in the West Indies, he was master of\r\nthe rich empires of Mexico and Peru, and claimed a right to a boundless\r\nextent of country, that offered an inexhaustible field to the cupidity\r\nand enterprise of the Spanish adventurer. Thus the dominions of Philip\r\nstretched over every quarter of the globe. The flag of Castile was seen\r\nin the remotest latitudes,--on the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the\r\nfar-off Indian seas,--passing from port to port, and uniting by\r\ncommercial intercourse the widely scattered members of her vast colonial\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish army consisted of the most formidable infantry in Europe;\r\nveterans who had been formed under the eye of Charles the Fifth and of\r\nhis generals, who had fought on the fields of Pavia and of Muhlberg, or\r\nwho, in the New World, had climbed the Andes with Almagro and Pizarro,\r\nand helped these bold chiefs to overthrow the dynasty of the Incas. The\r\nnavy of Spain and Flanders combined far exceeded that of any other power\r\nin the number and size of its vessels; and if its supremacy might be\r\ncontested by England on the \"narrow seas,\" it rode the undisputed\r\nmistress of the ocean. To supply the means for maintaining this costly\r\nestablishment, as well as the general machinery of government, Philip\r\nhad at his command the treasures of the New World; and if the incessant\r\nenterprises of his father had drained the exchequer, it was soon\r\nreplenished by the silver streams that flowed in from the inexhaustible\r\nmines of Zacatecas and Potosí.\r\n\r\nAll this vast empire, with its magnificent resources, was placed at the\r\ndisposal of a single man. Philip ruled over it with an authority more\r\nabsolute than that possessed by any European prince since the days of\r\nthe Cæsars. The Netherlands, indeed, maintained a show of independence\r\nunder the shadow of their ancient institutions. But they consented to\r\nsupply the necessities of the crown by a tax larger than the revenues of\r\nAmerica. Naples and Milan were ruled by Spanish viceroys. Viceroys, with\r\ndelegated powers scarcely less than those of their sovereign, presided\r\nover the American colonies, which received their laws from the parent\r\ncountry. In Spain itself, the authority of the nobles was gone. First\r\nassailed under Ferdinand and Isabella, it was completely broken down\r\nunder Charles the Fifth. The liberties of the commons were crushed at\r\nthe fatal battle of Villalar, in the beginning of that monarch's reign.\r\nWithout nobles, without commons, the ancient cortes had faded into a\r\nmere legislative pageant, with hardly any other right than that of\r\npresenting petitions, and of occasionally raising an ineffectual note of\r\nremonstrance against abuses. It had lost the power to redress them. Thus\r\nall authority vested in the sovereign. His will was the law of the land.\r\nFrom his palace at Madrid he sent forth the edicts which became the law\r\nof Spain and of her remotest colonies. It may well be believed that\r\nforeign nations watched with interest the first movements of a prince\r\nwho seemed to hold in his hands the destinies of Europe; and that they\r\nregarded with no little apprehension the growth of that colossal power\r\nwhich had already risen to a height that cast a shadow over every other\r\nmonarchy.\r\n\r\nFrom his position, Philip stood at the head of the Roman Catholic\r\nprinces. He was in temporal matters what the pope was in spiritual. In\r\nthe existing state of Christendom, he had the same interest as the pope\r\nin putting down that spirit of religious reform which had begun to show\r\nitself, in public or in private, in every corner of Europe. He was the\r\nnatural ally of the pope. He understood this well, and would have acted\r\non it. Yet, strange to say, his very first war, after his accession, was\r\nwith the pope himself. It was a war not of Philip's seeking.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PAUL THE FOURTH.]\r\n\r\nThe papal throne was at that time filled by Paul the Fourth, one of\r\nthose remarkable men, who, amidst the shadowy personages that have\r\nreigned in the Vatican, and been forgotten, have vindicated to\r\nthemselves a permanent place in history. He was a Neapolitan by birth,\r\nof the noble family of the Caraffas. He was bred to the religious\r\nprofession, and early attracted notice by his diligent application and\r\nthe fruits he gathered from it. His memory was prodigious. He was not\r\nonly deeply read in theological science, but skilled in various\r\nlanguages, ancient and modern, several of which he spoke with fluency.\r\nHis rank, sustained by his scholarship, raised him speedily to high\r\npreferment in the Church. In 1513, when thirty-six years of age, he went\r\nas nuncio to England. In 1525, he resigned his benefices, and, with a\r\nsmall number of his noble friends, he instituted a new religious order,\r\ncalled the Theatins.[131] The object of the society was, to combine, to\r\nsome extent, the contemplative habits of the monk with the more active\r\nduties of the secular clergy. The members visited the sick, buried the\r\ndead, and preached frequently in public, thus performing the most\r\nimportant functions of the priesthood. For this last vocation, of\r\npublic speaking, Caraffa was peculiarly qualified by a flow of natural\r\neloquence, which, if it did not always convince, was sure to carry away\r\nthe audience by its irresistible fervor.[132] The new order showed\r\nitself particularly zealous in enforcing reform in the Catholic clergy,\r\nand in stemming the tide of heresy which now threatened to inundate the\r\nChurch. Caraffa and his associates were earnest to introduce the\r\nInquisition. A life of asceticism and penance too often extinguishes\r\nsympathy with human suffering, and leads its votaries to regard the\r\nsharpest remedies as the most effectual for the cure of spiritual error.\r\n\r\nFrom this austere way of life Caraffa was called, in 1536, to a\r\nsituation which engaged him more directly in worldly concerns. He was\r\nmade cardinal by Paul the Third. He had, as far back as the time of\r\nFerdinand the Catholic, been one of the royal council of Naples. The\r\nfamily of Caraffa, however, was of the Angevine party, and regarded the\r\nhouse of Aragon in the light of usurpers. The cardinal had been educated\r\nin this political creed, and, even after his elevation to his new\r\ndignity, he strongly urged Paul the Third to assert the claims of the\r\nholy see to the sovereignty of Naples. This conduct, which came to the\r\nears of Charles the Fifth, so displeased that monarch that he dismissed\r\nCaraffa from the council. Afterwards, when the cardinal was named by the\r\npope, his unfailing patron, to the archbishopric of Naples, Charles\r\nresisted the nomination, and opposed all the obstacles in his power to\r\nthe collection of the episcopal revenues. These indignities sank deep\r\ninto the cardinal's mind, naturally tenacious of affronts; and what, at\r\nfirst, had been only a political animosity, was now sharpened into\r\npersonal hatred of the most implacable character.[133]\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of feeling when, on the death of Marcellus the\r\nSecond, in 1555, Cardinal Caraffa was raised to the papal throne. His\r\nelection, as was natural, greatly disgusted the emperor, and caused\r\nastonishment throughout Europe; for he had not the conciliatory manners\r\nwhich win the favor and the suffrages of mankind. But the Catholic\r\nChurch stood itself in need of a reformer, to enable it to resist the\r\nencroaching spirit of Protestantism. This was well understood not only\r\nby the highest, but by the humblest ecclesiastics; and in Caraffa they\r\nsaw the man whose qualities precisely fitted him to effect such a\r\nreform. He was, moreover, at the time of his election, in his eightieth\r\nyear; and age and infirmity have always proved powerful arguments with\r\nthe sacred college, as affording the numerous competitors the best\r\nguaranties for a speedy vacancy. Yet it has more than once happened that\r\nthe fortunate candidate, who has owed his election mainly to his\r\ninfirmities, has been miraculously restored by the touch of the tiara.\r\n\r\nPaul the Fourth--for such was the name assumed by the new pope, in\r\ngratitude to the memory of his patron--adopted a way of life, on his\r\naccession, for which his brethren of the college were not at all\r\nprepared. The austerity and self-denial of earlier days formed a strong\r\ncontrast to the pomp of his present establishment and the profuse luxury\r\nof his table. When asked how he would be served, \"How but as a great\r\nprince?\" he answered. He usually passed three hours at his dinner, which\r\nconsisted of numerous courses of the most refined and epicurean dishes.\r\nNo one dined with him, though one or more of the cardinals were usually\r\npresent, with whom he freely conversed; and as he accompanied his meals\r\nwith large draughts of the thick, black wine of Naples, it no doubt gave\r\nadditional animation to his discourse.[134] At such times, his favorite\r\ntheme was the Spaniards, whom he denounced as the scum of the earth, a\r\nrace accursed of God, heretics and schismatics, the spawn of Jews and of\r\nMoors. He bewailed the humiliation of Italy, galled by the yoke of a\r\nnation so abject. But the day had come, he would thunder out, when\r\nCharles and Philip were to be called to a reckoning for their ill-gotten\r\npossessions, and be driven from the land![135]\r\n\r\nYet Paul did not waste all his hours in this idle vaporing, nor in the\r\npleasures of the table. He showed the same activity as ever in the\r\nlabors of the closet, and in attention to business. He was irregular in\r\nhis hours, sometimes prolonging his studies through the greater part of\r\nthe night, and at others rising long before the dawn. When thus engaged,\r\nit would not have been well for any one of his household to venture into\r\nhis presence, without a summons.\r\n\r\nPaul seemed to be always in a state of nervous tension. \"He is all\r\nnerve,\" the Venetian minister, Navagero, writes of him; \"and when he\r\nwalks, it is with a free, elastic step, as if he hardly touched the\r\nground.\"[136] His natural arrogance, was greatly increased by his\r\nelevation to the first dignity in Christendom. He had always entertained\r\nthe highest ideas of the authority of the sacerdotal office; and now\r\nthat he was in the chair of St. Peter, he seemed to have entire\r\nconfidence in his own infallibility. He looked on the princes of Europe,\r\nnot so much as his sons--the language of the Church--as his servants,\r\nbound to do his bidding. Paul's way of thinking would have better suited\r\nthe twelfth century than the sixteenth. He came into the world at least\r\nthree centuries too late. In all his acts he relied solely on himself.\r\nHe was impatient of counsel from any one, and woe to the man who\r\nventured to oppose any remonstrance, still more any impediment to the\r\nexecution of his plans. He had no misgivings as to the wisdom of these\r\nplans. An idea that had once taken possession of his mind lay there, to\r\nborrow a cant phrase of the day, like \"a fixed fact,\"--not to be\r\ndisturbed by argument or persuasion. We occasionally meet with such\r\ncharacters, in which strength of will and unconquerable energy in action\r\npass for genius with the world. They, in fact, serve as the best\r\nsubstitute for genius, by the ascendancy which such qualities secure\r\ntheir possessors over ordinary minds. Yet there were ways of approaching\r\nthe pontiff, for those who understood his character, and who, by\r\ncondescending to flatter his humors, could turn them to their own\r\naccount. Such was the policy pursued by some of Paul's kindred, who,\r\ncheered by his patronage, now came forth from their obscurity to glitter\r\nin the rays of the meridian sun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COURT OF FRANCE.]\r\n\r\nPaul had all his life declaimed against nepotism as an opprobrious sin\r\nin the head of the Church. Yet no sooner did he put on the tiara than he\r\ngave a glaring example of the sin he had denounced, in the favors which\r\nhe lavished on three of his own nephews. This was the more remarkable,\r\nas they were men whose way of life had given scandal even to the\r\nItalians, not used to be too scrupulous in their judgments.\r\n\r\nThe eldest, who represented the family, he raised to the rank of duke,\r\nproviding him with an ample fortune from the confiscated property of the\r\nColonnas,--which illustrious house was bitterly persecuted by Paul, for\r\nits attachment to the Spanish interests.\r\n\r\nAnother of his nephews he made a cardinal,--a dignity for which he was\r\nindifferently qualified by his former profession, which was that of a\r\nsoldier, and still less fitted by his life, which was that of a\r\nlibertine. He was a person of a busy, intriguing disposition, and\r\nstimulated his uncle's vindictive feelings against the Spaniards, whom\r\nhe himself hated, for some affront which he conceived had been put upon\r\nhim while in the emperor's service.[137]\r\n\r\nBut Paul needed no prompter in this matter. He very soon showed that,\r\ninstead of ecclesiastical reform, he was bent on a project much nearer\r\nto his heart,--the subversion of the Spanish power in Naples. Like\r\nJulius the Second, of warlike memory, he swore to drive out the\r\n_barbarians_ from Italy. He seemed to think that the thunders of the\r\nVatican were more than a match for all the strength of the empire and of\r\nSpain. But he was not weak enough to rely wholly on his spiritual\r\nartillery in such a contest. Through the French ambassador at his court,\r\nhe opened negotiations with France, and entered into a secret treaty\r\nwith that power, by which each of the parties agreed to furnish a\r\ncertain contingent of men and money to carry on the war for the recovery\r\nof Naples. The treaty was executed on the sixteenth of December,\r\n1555.[138]\r\n\r\nIn less than two months after this event, on the fifth of February,\r\n1556, the fickle monarch of France, seduced by the advantageous offers\r\nof Charles, backed, moreover, by the ruinous state of his own finances,\r\ndeserted his new ally, and signed the treaty of Vaucelles, which secured\r\na truce for five years between his dominions and those of Philip.\r\n\r\nPaul received the news of this treaty while surrounded by his courtiers.\r\nHe treated the whole with scepticism, but expressed the pious hope, that\r\nsuch a peace might be in store for the nations of Christendom. In\r\nprivate he was not so temperate. But without expending his wrath in\r\nempty menaces, he took effectual means to bring things back to their\r\nformer state,--to induce the French king to renew the treaty with\r\nhimself, and at once to begin hostilities. He knew the vacillating\r\ntemper of the monarch he had to deal with. Cardinal Caraffa was\r\naccordingly despatched on a mission to Paris, fortified with ample\r\npowers for the arrangement of a new treaty, and with such tempting\r\npromises on the part of his holiness as might insure its acceptance by\r\nthe monarch and his ministers.\r\n\r\nThe French monarchy was, at that time, under the sceptre of Henry the\r\nSecond, the son of Francis the First, to whose character his own bore no\r\nresemblance; or rather the resemblance consisted in those showy\r\nqualities which lie too near the surface to enter into what may be\r\ncalled character. He affected a chivalrous vein, excelled in the\r\nexercises of the tourney, and indulged in vague aspirations after\r\nmilitary renown. In short, he fancied himself a hero, and seems to have\r\nimposed on some of his own courtiers so far as to persuade them that he\r\nwas designed for one. But he had few of the qualities which enter into\r\nthe character of a hero. He was as far from being a hero as he was from\r\nbeing a good Christian, though he thought to prove his orthodoxy by\r\npersecuting the Protestants, who were now rising into a formidable sect\r\nin the southern parts of his kingdom. He had little reliance on his own\r\nresources, leading a life of easy indulgence, and trusting the direction\r\nof his affairs to his favorites and his mistresses.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated of these was Diana of Poictiers, created by Henry\r\nduchess of Valentinois, who preserved her personal charms and her\r\ninfluence over her royal lover to a much later period than usually\r\nhappens. The persons of his court in whom the king most confided were\r\nthe Constable Montmorency and the duke of Guise.\r\n\r\nAnne de Montmorency, constable of France, was one of the proudest of the\r\nFrench nobility,--proud alike of his great name, his rank, and his\r\nauthority with his sovereign. He had grown gray in the service of the\r\ncourt, and Henry, accustomed to his society from boyhood, had learned to\r\nlean on him for the execution of his measures. Yet his judgments, though\r\nconfidently given, were not always sound. His views were far from being\r\nenlarged; and though full of courage, he showed little capacity for\r\nmilitary affairs. A consciousness of this, perhaps, may have led him to\r\nrecommend a pacific policy, suited to his own genius. He was a stanch\r\nCatholic, extremely punctilious in all the ceremonies of devotion, and,\r\nif we may credit Brantôme, would strangely mingle together the military\r\nand the religious. He repeated his Pater-Noster at certain fixed hours,\r\nwhatever might be his occupation at the time. He would occasionally\r\nbreak off to give his orders, calling out, \"Cut me down such a man!\"\r\n\"Hang up another!\" \"Run those fellows through with your lances!\" \"Set\r\nfire to that village!\"--and so on; when, having thus relieved the\r\nmilitary part of his conscience, he would go on with his Pater-Nosters\r\nas before.[139]\r\n\r\nA very different character was that of his younger rival, Francis, duke\r\nof Guise, uncle to Mary, queen of Scots, and brother to the regent. Of a\r\nbold, aspiring temper, filled with the love of glory, brilliant and\r\npopular in his address, he charmed the people by his manners and the\r\nsplendor of his equipage and dress. He came to court, attended usually\r\nby three or four hundred cavaliers, who formed themselves on Guise as\r\ntheir model. His fine person was set off by the showy costume of the\r\ntime,--a crimson doublet and cloak of spotless ermine, and a cap\r\nornamented with a scarlet plume. In this dress he might often be seen,\r\nmounted on his splendid charger and followed by a gay retinue of\r\ngentlemen, riding at full gallop through the streets of Paris, and\r\nattracting the admiration of the people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LEAGUE AGAINST SPAIN.]\r\n\r\nBut his character was not altogether made up of such vanities. He was\r\nsagacious in counsel, and had proved himself the best captain of France.\r\nIt was he who commanded at the memorable siege of Metz, and foiled the\r\nefforts of the imperial forces under Charles and the duke of Alva.\r\nCaraffa found little difficulty in winning him over to his cause, as he\r\nopened to the ambitious chief the brilliant perspective of the conquest\r\nof Naples. The arguments of the wily Italian were supported by the\r\nduchess of Valentinois. It was in vain that the veteran Montmorency\r\nreminded the king of the ruinous state of the finances, which had driven\r\nhim to the shameful expedient of putting up public offices to sale. The\r\nother party represented that the condition of Spain, after her long\r\nstruggle, was little better; that the reins of government had now been\r\ntransferred from the wise Charles to the hands of his inexperienced son;\r\nand that the coöperation of Rome afforded a favorable conjunction of\r\ncircumstances, not to be neglected. Henry was further allured by\r\nCaraffa's assurance that his uncle would grant to the French monarch the\r\ninvestiture of Naples for one of his younger sons, and bestow Milan on\r\nanother. The offer was too tempting to be resisted.\r\n\r\nOne objection occurred, in certain conscientious scruples as to the\r\nviolation of the recent treaty of Vaucelles. But for this the pope, who\r\nhad anticipated the objection, readily promised absolution. As the king\r\nalso intimated some distrust lest the successor of Paul, whose advanced\r\nage made his life precarious, might not be inclined to carry out the\r\ntreaty, Caraffa was authorized to assure him that this danger should be\r\nobviated by the creation of a batch of French cardinals, or of cardinals\r\nin the French interest.\r\n\r\nAll the difficulties being thus happily disposed of, the treaty was\r\nexecuted in the month of July, 1556. The parties agreed each to furnish\r\nabout twelve thousand infantry, five hundred men-at-arms, and the same\r\nnumber of light horse. France was to contribute three hundred and fifty\r\nthousand ducats to the expenses of the war, and Rome one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand. The French troops were to be supplied with provisions by\r\nthe pope, for which they were to reimburse his holiness. It was moreover\r\nagreed, that the crown of Naples should be settled on a younger son of\r\nHenry, that a considerable tract on the northern frontier should be\r\ntransferred to the papal territory, and that ample estates should be\r\nprovided from the new conquests for the three nephews of his holiness.\r\nIn short, the system of partition was as nicely adjusted as if the\r\nquarry were actually in their possession, ready to be cut up and divided\r\namong the parties.[140]\r\n\r\nFinally, it was arranged that Henry should invite the Sultan Solyman to\r\nrenew his former alliance with France, and make a descent with his\r\ngalleys on the coast of Calabria. Thus did his most Christian majesty,\r\nwith the pope for one of his allies and the Grand Turk for the other,\r\nprepare to make war on the most Catholic prince in Christendom![141]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Paul the Fourth, elated by the prospect of a successful\r\nnegotiation, threw off the little decency he had hitherto preserved in\r\nhis deportment. He launched out into invectives more bitter than ever\r\nagainst Philip, and in a tone of defiance told such of the Spanish\r\ncardinals as were present that they might repeat his sayings to their\r\nmaster. He talked of instituting a legal process against the king for\r\nthe recovery of Naples, which he had forfeited by omitting to pay the\r\nyearly tribute to the holy see. The pretext was ill-founded, as the pope\r\nwell knew. But the process went on with suitable gravity, and a sentence\r\nof forfeiture was ultimately pronounced against the Spanish monarch.\r\n\r\nWith these impotent insults, Paul employed more effectual means of\r\nannoyance. He persecuted all who showed any leaning to the Spanish\r\ninterest. He set about repairing the walls of Rome, and strengthening\r\nthe garrisons on the frontier. His movements raised great alarm among\r\nthe Romans, who had too vivid a recollection of their last war with\r\nSpain, under Clement the Seventh, to wish for another. Garcilasso de la\r\nVega, who had represented Philip, during his father's reign, at the\r\npapal court, wrote a full account of these doings to the viceroy of\r\nNaples. Garcilasso was instantly thrown into prison. Taxis, the Spanish\r\ndirector of the posts, was both thrown into prison and put to the\r\ntorture. Saria, the imperial ambassador, after in vain remonstrating\r\nagainst these outrages, waited on the pope to demand his passport, and\r\nwas kept standing a full hour at the gate of the Vatican, before he was\r\nadmitted.[142]\r\n\r\nPhilip had full intelligence of all these proceedings. He had long since\r\ndescried the dark storm that was mustering beyond the Alps. He had\r\nprovided for it at the close of the preceding year, by committing the\r\ngovernment of Naples to the man most competent to such a crisis. This\r\nwas the duke of Alva, at that time governor of Milan, and\r\ncommander-in-chief of the army in Italy. As this remarkable person is to\r\noccupy a large space in the subsequent pages of this narrative, it may\r\nbe well to give some account of his earlier life.\r\n\r\nFernando Alvarez de Toledo was descended from an illustrious house in\r\nCastile, whose name is associated with some of the most memorable events\r\nin the national history. He was born in 1508, and while a child had the\r\nmisfortune to lose his father, who perished in Africa, at the siege of\r\nGelves. The care of the orphan devolved on his grandfather, the\r\ncelebrated conqueror of Navarre. Under this veteran teacher the young\r\nFernando received his first lessons in war, being present at more than\r\none skirmish when quite a boy. This seems to have sharpened his appetite\r\nfor a soldier's life, for we find him at the age of sixteen, secretly\r\nleaving his home and taking service under the banner of the Constable\r\nVelasco, at the siege of Fontarabia. He was subsequently made governor\r\nof that place. In 1527, when not twenty years of age, he came, by his\r\ngrandfather's death, into possession of the titles and large patrimonial\r\nestates of the house of Toledo.\r\n\r\nThe capacity which he displayed, as well as his high rank, soon made him\r\nan object of attention; and as Philip grew in years, the duke of Alva\r\nwas placed near his person, formed one of his council, and took part in\r\nthe regency of Castile. He accompanied Philip on his journeys from\r\nSpain, and, as we have seen, made one of his retinue both in Flanders\r\nand in England. The duke was of too haughty and imperious a temper to\r\ncondescend to those arts which are thought to open the most ready\r\navenues to the favor of the sovereign. He met with rivals of a finer\r\npolicy and more accommodating disposition. Yet Philip perfectly\r\ncomprehended his character. He knew the strength of his understanding,\r\nand did full justice to his loyalty; and he showed his confidence in his\r\nintegrity by placing him in offices of the highest responsibility.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PREPARATIONS FOR WAR.]\r\n\r\nThe emperor, with his usual insight into character, had early discerned\r\nthe military talents of the young nobleman. He took Alva along with him\r\non his campaigns in Germany, where from a subordinate station he rapidly\r\nrose to the first command in the army. Such was his position at the\r\nunfortunate siege of Metz, where the Spanish infantry had nearly been\r\nsacrificed to the obstinacy of Charles.\r\n\r\nIn his military career the duke displayed some of the qualities most\r\ncharacteristic of his countrymen. But they were those qualities which\r\nbelong to a riper period of life. He showed little of that romantic and\r\nadventurous spirit of the Spanish cavalier, which seemed to court peril\r\nfor its own sake, and would hazard all on a single cast. Caution was his\r\nprominent trait, in which he was a match for any graybeard in the\r\narmy;--a caution carried to such a length as sometimes to put a curb on\r\nthe enterprising spirit of the emperor. Men were amazed to see so old a\r\nhead on so young shoulders.\r\n\r\nYet this caution was attended by a courage which dangers could not\r\ndaunt, and by a constancy which toil, however severe, could not tire. He\r\npreferred the surest, even though the slowest, means to attain his\r\nobject. He was not ambitious of effect; he never sought to startle by a\r\nbrilliant _coup-de-main_. He would not have compromised a single chance\r\nin his own favor by appealing to the issue of a battle. He looked\r\nsteadily to the end, and he moved surely towards it by a system of\r\noperations planned with the nicest forecast. The result of these\r\noperations was almost always success. Few great commanders have been\r\nmore uniformly successful in their campaigns. Yet it was rare that these\r\ncampaigns were marked by what is so dazzling to the imagination of the\r\nyoung aspirant for glory,--a great and decisive victory.--Such were some\r\nof the more obvious traits in the military character of the chief to\r\nwhom Philip, at this crisis, confided the post of viceroy of\r\nNaples.[143]\r\n\r\nBefore commencing hostilities against the Church, the Spanish monarch\r\ndetermined to ease his conscience, by obtaining, if possible, a warrant\r\nfor his proceedings from the Church itself. He assembled a body composed\r\nof theologians from Salamanca, Alcalá, Valladolid, and some other\r\nplaces, and of jurists from his several councils, to resolve certain\r\nqueries which he propounded. Among the rest, he inquired whether, in\r\ncase of a defensive war with the pope, it would not be lawful to\r\nsequestrate the revenues of those persons, natives or foreigners, who\r\nhad benefices in Spain, but who refused obedience to the orders of its\r\nsovereign;--whether he might not lay an embargo on all revenues of the\r\nChurch, and prohibit any remittance of moneys to Rome;--whether a\r\ncouncil might not be convoked to determine the validity of Paul's\r\nelection, which, in some particulars, was supposed to have been\r\nirregular;--whether inquiry might not be made into the gross abuses of\r\necclesiastical patronage by the Roman see, and effectual measures taken\r\nto redress them. The suggestion of an ecclesiastical council was a\r\nmenace that grated unpleasantly on the pontifical ear, and was used by\r\nEuropean princes as a sort of counterblast to the threat of\r\nexcommunication. The particular objects for which this council was to be\r\nsummoned were not of a kind to soothe the irritable nerves of his\r\nholiness. The conclave of theologians and jurists made as favorable\r\nresponses as the king had anticipated to his several interrogatories;\r\nand Philip, under so respectable a sanction, sent orders to his viceroy\r\nto take effectual measures for the protection of Naples.[144]\r\n\r\nAlva had not waited for these orders, but had busily employed himself in\r\nmustering his resources, and in collecting troops from the Abruzzi and\r\nother parts of his territory. As hostilities were inevitable, he\r\ndetermined to strike the first blow, and carry the war into the enemy's\r\ncountry, before he had time to cross the Neapolitan frontier. Like his\r\nmaster, however, the duke was willing to release himself, as far as\r\npossible, from personal responsibility before taking up arms against the\r\nhead of the Church. He accordingly addressed a manifesto to the pope and\r\nthe cardinals, setting forth in glowing terms the manifold grievances of\r\nhis sovereign; the opprobrious and insulting language of Paul; the\r\nindignities offered to Philip's agents, and to the imperial ambassador;\r\nthe process instituted for depriving his master of Naples; and, lastly,\r\nthe warlike demonstrations of the pope along the frontier, which left no\r\ndoubt as to his designs. He conjured his holiness to pause before he\r\nplunged his country into war. As the head of the Church, it was his duty\r\nto preserve peace, not to bring war into Christendom. He painted the\r\ninevitable evils of war, and the ruin and devastation which it must\r\nbring on the fair fields of Italy. If this were done, it would be the\r\npope's doing, and his would be the responsibility. On the part of\r\nNaples, the war would be a war of defence. For himself, he had no\r\nalternative. He was placed there to maintain the possessions of his\r\nsovereign; and, by the blessing of God, he would maintain them to the\r\nlast drop of his blood.[145]\r\n\r\nAlva, while making this appeal to the pope, invoked the good offices of\r\nthe Venetian government in bringing about a reconciliation between\r\nPhilip and the Vatican. His spirited manifesto to the pope was intrusted\r\nto a special messenger, a person of some consideration in Naples. The\r\nonly reply which the hot-headed pontiff made to it was to throw the\r\nenvoy into prison, and, as some state, to put him to the torture.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Alva, who had not placed much reliance on the success of his\r\nappeal, had mustered a force, amounting in all to twelve thousand\r\ninfantry, fifteen hundred horse, and a train of twelve pieces of\r\nartillery. His infantry was chiefly made up of Neapolitans, some of whom\r\nhad seen but little service. The strength of his army lay in his Spanish\r\nveterans, forming one third of his force. The place of rendezvous was\r\nSan Germano, a town on the northern frontier of the kingdom. On the\r\nfirst of September, 1556, Alva, attended by a gallant band of cavaliers,\r\nleft the capital, and on the fourth arrived at the place appointed. The\r\nfollowing day he crossed the borders at the head of his troops, and\r\nmarched on Pontecorvo. He met with no resistance from the inhabitants,\r\nwho at once threw open their gates to him. Several other places followed\r\nthe example of Pontecorvo; and Alva, taking possession of them, caused a\r\nscutcheon displaying the arms of the sacred college to be hung up in the\r\nprincipal church of each town, with a placard announcing that he held it\r\nonly for the college, until the election of a new pontiff. By this act\r\nhe proclaimed to the Christian world that the object of the war, as far\r\nas Spain was concerned, was not conquest, but defence. Some historians\r\nfind in it a deeper policy,--that of exciting feelings of distrust\r\nbetween the pope and the cardinals.[146]\r\n\r\nAnagni, a place of some strength, refused the duke's summons to\r\nsurrender. He was detained three days before his guns had opened a\r\npracticable breach in the walls. He then ordered an assault. The town\r\nwas stormed and delivered up to sack,--by which phrase is to be\r\nunderstood the perpetration of all those outrages which the ruthless\r\ncode of war allowed, in that age, on the persons and property of the\r\ndefenceless inhabitants, without regard to sex or age.[147]\r\n\r\nOne or two other places which made resistance shared the fate of Anagni;\r\nand the duke of Alva, having garrisoned his new conquests with such\r\nforces as he could spare, led his victorious legions against Tivoli,--a\r\ntown strongly situated on elevated ground, commanding the eastern\r\napproaches to the capital. The place surrendered without attempting a\r\ndefence; and Alva, willing to give his men some repose, made Tivoli his\r\nhead-quarters; while his army spread over the suburbs and adjacent\r\ncountry, which afforded good forage for his cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe rapid succession of these events, the fall of town after town, and,\r\nabove all, the dismal fate of Anagni, filled the people of Rome with\r\nterror. The women began to hurry out of the city; many of the men would\r\nhave followed but for the interference of Cardinal Caraffa. The panic\r\nwas as great as if the enemy had been already at the gates of the\r\ncapital. Amidst this general consternation, Paul seemed to be almost the\r\nonly person who retained his self-possession. Navagero, the Venetian\r\nminister, was present when he received tidings of the storming of\r\nAnagni, and bears witness to the composure with which he went through\r\nthe official business of the morning, as if nothing had happened.[148]\r\nThis was in public; but the shock was sufficiently strong to strike out\r\nsome sparkles of his fiery temper, as those found who met him that day\r\nin private. To the Venetian agent who had come to Rome to mediate a\r\npeace, and who had pressed him to enter into some terms of accommodation\r\nwith the Spaniards, he haughtily replied, that Alva must first recross\r\nthe frontier, and then, if he had aught to solicit, prefer his petition\r\nlike a dutiful son of the Church. This course was not one very likely to\r\nbe adopted by the victorious general[149]\r\n\r\nIn an interview with two French gentlemen, who, as he had reason to\r\nsuppose, were interesting themselves in the affair of a peace, he\r\nexclaimed: \"Whoever would bring me into a peace with heretics is a\r\nservant of the Devil. Heaven will take vengeance on him. I will pray\r\nthat God's curse may fall on him. If I find that you intermeddle in any\r\nsuch matter, I will cut your heads off your shoulders. Do not think this\r\nan empty threat. I have an eye in my back on you,\"--quoting an Italian\r\nproverb,--\"and if I find you playing me false, or attempting to entangle\r\nme a second time in an accursed truce, I swear to you by the eternal\r\nGod, I will make your heads fly from your shoulders, come what may come\r\nof it!\" \"In this way,\" concludes the narrator, one of the parties, \"his\r\nholiness continued for nearly an hour, walking up and down the\r\napartment, and talking all the while of his own grievances and of\r\ncutting off our heads, until he had talked himself quite out of\r\nbreath.\"[150]\r\n\r\nBut the valor of the pope did not expend itself in words. He instantly\r\nset about putting the capital in the best state of defence. He taxed the\r\npeople to raise funds for his troops, drew in the garrisons from the\r\nneighboring places, formed a body-guard of six or seven hundred horse,\r\nand soon had the satisfaction of seeing his Roman levies, amounting to\r\nsix thousand infantry, well equipped for the war. They made a brave\r\nshow, with their handsome uniforms and their banners richly emblazoned\r\nwith the pontifical arms. As they passed in review before his holiness,\r\nwho stood at one of the windows of his palace, he gave them his\r\nbenediction. But the edge of the Roman sword, according to an old\r\nproverb, was apt to be blunt; and these holiday troops were soon found\r\nto be no match for the hardy veterans of Spain.\r\n\r\nAmong the soldiers at the pope's disposal was a body of German\r\nmercenaries, who followed war as a trade, and let themselves out to the\r\nhighest bidder. They were Lutherans, with little knowledge of the Roman\r\nCatholic religion, and less respect for it. They stared at its rites as\r\nmummeries, and made a jest of its most solemn ceremonies, directly under\r\nthe eyes of the pope. But Paul, who at other times would have punished\r\noffences like these with the gibbet and the stake, could not quarrel\r\nwith his defenders, and was obliged to digest his mortification as he\r\nbest might. It was remarked that the times were sadly out of joint, when\r\nthe head of the Church had heretics for his allies and Catholics for his\r\nenemies.[151]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the duke of Alva was lying at Tivoli. If he had taken\r\nadvantage of the panic caused by his successes, he might, it was\r\nthought, without much difficulty, have made himself master of the\r\ncapital. But this did not suit his policy, which was rather to bring the\r\npope to terms than to ruin him. He was desirous to reduce the city by\r\ncutting off its supplies. The possession of Tivoli, as already noticed,\r\nenabled him to command the eastern approaches to Rome, and he now\r\nproposed to make himself master of Ostia and thus destroy the\r\ncommunications with the coast.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VICTORIOUS CAMPAIGN.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, drawing together his forces, he quitted Tivoli, and\r\ndirected his march across the Campagna, south of the Roman capital. On\r\nhis way he made himself master of some places belonging to the holy see,\r\nand in the early part of November arrived before Ostia, and took up a\r\nposition on the banks of the Tiber, where it spread into two branches,\r\nthe northern one of which was called the Fiumicino, or little river. The\r\ntown, or rather village, consisted of only a few straggling houses, very\r\ndifferent from the proud Ostia, whose capacious harbor was once filled\r\nwith the commerce of the world. It was protected by a citadel of some\r\nstrength, garrisoned by a small but picked body of troops, so\r\nindifferently provided with military stores, that it was clear the\r\ngovernment had not anticipated an attack in this quarter.\r\n\r\nThe duke ordered a number of boats to be sent round from Nettuno, a\r\nplace on the coast, of which he had got possession. By means of these he\r\nformed a bridge, over which he passed a small detachment of his army,\r\ntogether with his battering train of artillery. The hamlet was easily\r\ntaken, but, as the citadel refused to surrender, Alva laid regular siege\r\nto it. He constructed two batteries, on which he planted his heavy guns,\r\ncommanding opposite quarters of the fortress. He then opened a lively\r\ncannonade on the outworks, which was returned with great spirit by the\r\ngarrison.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he detached a considerable body of horse, under Colonna, who\r\nswept the country to the very walls of Rome. A squadron of cavalry,\r\nwhose gallant bearing had filled the heart of the old pope with\r\nexultation, sallied out against the marauders. An encounter took place\r\nnot far from the city. The Romans bore themselves up bravely to the\r\nshock; but, after splintering their lances, they wheeled about, and,\r\nwithout striking another blow, abandoned the field to the enemy, who\r\nfollowed them up to the gates of the capital. They were so roughly\r\nhandled in their flight, that the valiant troopers could not be induced\r\nagain to leave their walls, although Cardinal Caraffa--who had a narrow\r\nescape from the enemy--sallied out with a handful of his followers, to\r\ngive them confidence.[152]\r\n\r\nDuring this time Alva was vigorously pressing the siege of Ostia; but\r\nthough more than a week had elapsed, the besieged showed no disposition\r\nto surrender. At length, the Spanish commander, on the seventeenth of\r\nNovember, finding his ammunition nearly expended and his army short of\r\nprovisions, determined on a general assault. Early on the following\r\nmorning, after hearing mass as usual, the duke mounted his horse, and,\r\nriding among the ranks to animate the spirits of his soldiers, gave\r\norders for the attack. A corps of Italians was first detached, to scale\r\nthe works; but they were repulsed with considerable loss. It was found\r\nimpossible for their officers to rally them, and bring them back to the\r\nassault. A picked body of Spanish infantry was then despatched on this\r\ndangerous service. With incredible difficulty they succeeded in scaling\r\nthe ramparts, under a storm of combustibles and other missiles hurled\r\ndown by the garrison, and effected an entrance into the place. But here\r\nthey were met with a courage as dauntless as their own. The struggle was\r\nlong and desperate. There had been no such fighting in the course of the\r\ncampaign. At length, the duke, made aware of the severe loss sustained\r\nby his men, and of the impracticability of the attempt, as darkness was\r\nsetting in, gave the signal for retreat. The assailants had doubtless\r\nthe worst of it in the conflict; but the besieged, worn out with\r\nfatigue, with their ammunition nearly exhausted, and almost without\r\nfood, did not feel themselves in condition to sustain another assault on\r\nthe following day. On the nineteenth of November, therefore, the morning\r\nafter the conflict, the brave garrison capitulated, and were treated\r\nwith honor as prisoners of war.[153]\r\n\r\nThe fate of the campaign seemed now to be decided. The pope, with, his\r\nprincipal towns in the hands of the enemy, his communications cut off\r\nboth with the country and the coast, may well have felt his inability to\r\ncontend thus single-handed against the power of Spain. At all events,\r\nhis subjects felt it, and they were not deterred by his arrogant bearing\r\nfrom clamoring loudly against the continuance of this ruinous war. But\r\nPaul would not hear of a peace. However crippled by his late reverses,\r\nhe felt confident of repairing them all on the arrival of the French,\r\nwho, as he now learned with joy, were in full march across the territory\r\nof Milan. He was not so disinclined to a truce, which might give time\r\nfor their coming.\r\n\r\nCardinal Caraffa, accordingly, had a conference with the duke of Alva,\r\nand entered into negotiations with him for a suspension of arms. The\r\nproposal was not unwelcome to the duke, who, weakened by losses of every\r\nkind, was by no means in condition at the end of an active campaign to\r\ncontend with a fresh army under the command of so practised a leader as\r\nthe duke of Guise. He did not care to expose himself a second time to an\r\nencounter with the French general, under disadvantages nearly as great\r\nas those which had foiled him at Metz.\r\n\r\nWith these amiable dispositions, a truce was soon arranged between the\r\nparties, to continue forty days. The terms were honorable to Alva, since\r\nthey left him in possession of all his conquests. Having completed these\r\narrangements, the Spanish commander broke up his camp on the southern\r\nbank of the Tiber, recrossed the frontier, and in a few days made his\r\ntriumphant entry, at the head of his battalions, into the city of\r\nNaples.[154]\r\n\r\nSo ended the first campaign of the war with Rome. It had given a severe\r\nlesson, that might have shaken the confidence and humbled the pride of a\r\npontiff less arrogant than Paul the Fourth. But it served only to deepen\r\nhis hatred of the Spaniards, and to stimulate his desire for vengeance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GUISE ENTERS ITALY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nWAR WITH THE POPE.\r\n\r\nGuise enters Italy.--Operations in the Abruzzi.--Siege of\r\nCivitella.--Alva drives out the French.--Rome menaced by the\r\nSpaniards.--Paul consents to Peace.--Paul's subsequent Career.\r\n\r\n1557.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the events recorded in the preceding pages were passing in Italy,\r\nthe French army, under the duke of Guise, had arrived on the borders of\r\nPiedmont. That commander, on leaving Paris, found himself at the head of\r\na force consisting of twelve thousand infantry, of which five thousand\r\nwere Swiss, and the rest French, including a considerable number of\r\nGascons. His cavalry amounted to two thousand, and he was provided with\r\ntwelve pieces of artillery. In addition to this, Guise was attended by a\r\ngallant body of French gentlemen, young for the most part, and eager to\r\nwin laurels under the renowned defender of Metz.\r\n\r\nThe French army met with no opposition in its passage through Piedmont.\r\nThe king of Spain had ordered the government of Milan to strengthen the\r\ngarrisons of the fortresses, but to oppose no resistance to the French,\r\nunless the latter began hostilities.[155] Some of the duke's counsellors\r\nwould have persuaded him to do so. His father-in-law, the duke of\r\nFerrara, in particular, who had brought him a reinforcement of six\r\nthousand troops, strongly pressed the French general to make sure of the\r\nMilanese before penetrating to the south; otherwise he would leave a\r\ndangerous enemy in his rear. The Italian urged, moreover, the importance\r\nof such a step in giving confidence to the Angevine faction in Naples,\r\nand in drawing over to France those states which hesitated as to their\r\npolicy, or which had but lately consented to an alliance with Spain.\r\n\r\nFrance, at this time, exercised but little influence in the counsels of\r\nthe Italian powers. Genoa, after an ineffectual attempt at revolution,\r\nwas devoted to Spain. The coöperation of Cosmo de'Medici, then lord of\r\nTuscany, had been secured by the cession of Sienna. The duke of Parma,\r\nwho had coquetted for some time with the French monarch, was won over to\r\nSpain by the restoration of Placentia, of which he had been despoiled by\r\nCharles the Fifth. His young son, Alexander Farnese, was sent as a\r\nhostage, to be educated under Philip's eye, at the court of Madrid,--the\r\nfruits of which training were to be gathered in the war of the\r\nNetherlands, where he proved himself the most consummate captain of his\r\ntime. Venice, from her lonely watch-tower on the Adriatic, regarded at a\r\ndistance the political changes of Italy, prepared to profit by any\r\nchances in her own favor. Her conservative policy, however, prompted her\r\nto maintain things as far as possible in their present position. She was\r\nmost desirous that the existing equilibrium should not be disturbed by\r\nthe introduction of any new power on the theatre of Italy; and she had\r\nreadily acquiesced in the invitation of the duke of Alva, to mediate an\r\naccommodation between the contending parties. This pacific temper found\r\nlittle encouragement from the belligerent pontiff who had brought the\r\nwar upon Italy.\r\n\r\nThe advice of the duke of Ferrara, however judicious in itself, was not\r\nrelished by his son-in-law, the duke of Guise, who was anxious to press\r\nforward to Naples as the proper scene of his conquests. The pope, too,\r\ncalled on him, in the most peremptory terms, to hasten his march, as\r\nNaples was the object of the expedition. The French commander had the\r\naddress to obtain instructions to the same effect from his own court, by\r\nwhich he affected to be decided. His Italian father-in-law was so much\r\ndisgusted by this determination, that he instantly quitted the camp, and\r\ndrew off his six thousand soldiers, declaring that he needed all he\r\ncould muster to protect his own states against the troops of Milan.[156]\r\n\r\nThus shorn of his Italian reinforcement, the duke of Guise resumed his\r\nmarch, and, entering the States of the Church, followed down the shores\r\nof the Adriatic, passing through Ravenna and Rimini; then, striking into\r\nthe interior, he halted at Gesi, where he found good accommodations for\r\nhis men and abundant forage for the horses.\r\n\r\nLeaving his army in their pleasant quarters, he soon after repaired to\r\nRome, in order to arrange with the pope the plan of the campaign. He was\r\ngraciously received by Paul, who treated him with distinguished honor as\r\nthe loyal champion of the Church. Emboldened by the presence of the\r\nFrench army in his dominions, the pope no longer hesitated to proclaim\r\nthe renewal of the war against Spain. The Roman levies, scattered over\r\nthe Campagna, assaulted the places but feebly garrisoned by the\r\nSpaniards. Most of them, including Tivoli and Ostia, were retaken; and\r\nthe haughty bosom of the pontiff swelled with exultation as he\r\nanticipated the speedy extinction of the Spanish rule in Italy.\r\n\r\nAfter some days consumed in the Vatican, Guise rejoined his army at\r\nGesi. He was fortified by abundant assurances of aid from his holiness,\r\nand he was soon joined by one of Paul's nephews, the duke of Montebello,\r\nwith a slender reinforcement. It was determined to cross the Neapolitan\r\nfrontier at once, and to begin operations by the siege of Campli.\r\n\r\nThis was a considerable place, situated in the midst of a fruitful\r\nterritory. The native population had been greatly increased by the\r\ninflux of people from the surrounding country, who had taken refuge in\r\nCampli as a place of security. But they did little for its defence. It\r\ndid not long resist the impetuosity of the French, who carried the town\r\nby storm. The men--all who made resistance--were put to the sword. The\r\nwomen were abandoned to the licentious soldiery. The houses, first\r\npillaged, were then fired; and the once flourishing place was soon\r\nconverted into a heap of smouldering ruins. The booty was great, for the\r\npeople of the neighborhood had brought their effects thither for safety,\r\nand a large amount of gold and silver was found in the dwellings. The\r\ncellars, too, were filled with delicate wines; and the victors abandoned\r\nthemselves to feasting and wassail, while the wretched citizens wandered\r\nlike spectres amidst the ruins of their ancient habitations.[157]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SIEGE OF CIVITELLA.]\r\n\r\nThe fate of Italy, in the sixteenth century, was hard indeed. She had\r\nadvanced far beyond the age in most of the arts which belong to a\r\ncivilized community. Her cities, even her smaller towns, throughout the\r\ncountry, displayed the evidences of architectural taste. They were\r\nfilled with stately temples and elegant mansions; the squares were\r\nornamented with fountains of elaborate workmanship; the rivers were\r\nspanned by arches of solid masonry. The private as well as public\r\nedifices were furnished with costly works of art, of which the value was\r\nless in the material than in the execution. A generation had scarcely\r\npassed since Michael Angelo and Raphael had produced their miracles of\r\nsculpture and of painting; and now Correggio, Paul Veronese, and Titian\r\nwere filling their country with those immortal productions which have\r\nbeen the delight and the despair of succeeding ages. Letters kept pace\r\nwith art. The magical strains of Ariosto had scarcely died away when a\r\ngreater bard had arisen in Tasso, to take up the tale of Christian\r\nchivalry. This extraordinary combination of elegant art and literary\r\nculture was the more remarkable, from the contrast presented by the\r\ncondition of the rest of Europe, then first rising into the light of a\r\nhigher civilization. But, with all this intellectual progress, Italy was\r\nsadly deficient in some qualities found among the hardier sons of the\r\nnorth, and which seem indispensable to a national existence. She could\r\nboast of her artists, her poets, her politicians; but of few real\r\npatriots, few who rested their own hopes on the independence of their\r\ncountry. The freedom of the old Italian republics had passed away. There\r\nwas scarcely one that had not surrendered its liberties to a master. The\r\nprinciple of union for defence against foreign aggression was as little\r\nunderstood as the principle of political liberty at home. The states\r\nwere jealous of one another. The cities were jealous of one another, and\r\nwere often torn by factions within themselves. Thus their individual\r\nstrength was alike ineffectual, whether for self-government or\r\nself-defence. The gift of beauty which Italy possessed in so\r\nextraordinary a degree only made her a more tempting prize to the\r\nspoiler, whom she had not the strength or the courage to resist. The\r\nTurkish corsair fell upon her coasts, plundered her maritime towns, and\r\nswept off their inhabitants into slavery. The Europeans, scarcely less\r\nbarbarous, crossed the Alps, and, striking into the interior, fell upon\r\nthe towns and hamlets that lay sheltered among the hills and in the\r\nquiet valleys, and converted them into heaps of ruins. Ill fares it with\r\nthe land which, in an age of violence, has given itself up to the study\r\nof the graceful and the beautiful, to the neglect of those hardy virtues\r\nwhich can alone secure a nation's independence.\r\n\r\nFrom the smoking ruins of Campli, Guise led his troops against\r\nCivitella, a town but a few miles distant. It was built round a conical\r\nhill, the top of which was crowned by a fortress well lined with\r\nartillery. It was an important place for the command of the frontier,\r\nand the duke of Alva had thrown into it a garrison of twelve hundred men\r\nunder the direction of an experienced officer, the marquis of Santa\r\nFiore. The French general considered that the capture of this post, so\r\nsoon following the sack of Campli, would spread terror among the\r\nNeapolitans, and encourage those of the Angevine faction to declare\r\nopenly in his favor.\r\n\r\nAs the place refused to surrender, he prepared to besiege it in form,\r\nthrowing up intrenchments, and only waiting for his heavy guns to begin\r\nactive hostilities. He impatiently expected their arrival for some days,\r\nwhen he caused four batteries to be erected, to operate simultaneously\r\nagainst four quarters of the town. After a brisk cannonade, which was\r\nreturned by the besieged with equal spirit, and with still greater loss\r\nto the enemy, from his exposed position, the duke, who had opened a\r\nbreach in the works, prepared for a general assault. It was conducted\r\nwith the usual impetuosity of the French, but was repulsed with courage\r\nby the Italians. More than once the assailants were brought up to the\r\nbreach, and as often driven back with slaughter. The duke, convinced\r\nthat he had been too precipitate, was obliged to sound a retreat, and\r\nagain renewed the cannonade from his batteries, keeping it up night and\r\nday, though, from the vertical direction of the fire, with comparatively\r\nlittle effect. The French camp offered a surer mark to the guns of\r\nCivitella.\r\n\r\nThe women of the place displayed an intrepidity equal to that of the\r\nmen. Armed with buckler and cuirass, they might be seen by the side of\r\ntheir husbands and brothers, in the most exposed situations on the\r\nramparts; and, as one was shot down, another stepped forward to take\r\nthe place of her fallen comrade.[158] The fate of Campli had taught them\r\nto expect no mercy from the victor, and they preferred death to\r\ndishonor.\r\n\r\nAs day after day passed on in the same monotonous manner, Guise's troops\r\nbecame weary of their inactive life. The mercurial spirits of the French\r\nsoldier, which overleaped every obstacle in his path, were often found\r\nto evaporate in the tedium of protracted operations, where there was\r\nneither incident nor excitement. Such a state of things was better\r\nsuited to the patient and persevering Spaniard. The men began openly to\r\nmurmur against the pope, whom they regarded as the cause of their\r\ntroubles. They were led by priests, they said, \"who knew much more of\r\npraying than of fighting.\"[159]\r\n\r\nGuise himself had causes of disgust with the pontiff which he did not\r\ncare to conceal. For all the splendid promises of his holiness, he had\r\nreceived few supplies either of men, ammunition, or money; and of the\r\nAngevine lords not one had ventured to declare in his favor or to take\r\nservice under his banner. He urged all this with much warmth on the\r\npope's nephew, the duke of Montebello. The Italian, recriminated as\r\nwarmly, till the dialogue was abruptly ended, it is said, by the duke of\r\nGuise throwing a napkin, or, according to some accounts, a dish, at the\r\nhead of his ally.[160] However this may be, Montebello left the camp in\r\ndisgust and returned to Rome. But the defender of the Church was too\r\nimportant a person to quarrel with, and Paul deemed it prudent, for the\r\npresent, at least, to stifle his resentment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile heavy rains set in, causing great annoyance to the French\r\ntroops in their quarters, spoiling their provisions, and doing great\r\ndamage to their powder. The same rain did good service to the besieged,\r\nby filling their cisterns. \"God,\" exclaimed the profane Guise, \"must\r\nhave turned Spaniard.\"[161]\r\n\r\nWhile these events were taking place in the north of Naples, the duke of\r\nAlva, in the south, was making active preparations for the defence of\r\nthe kingdom. He had seen with satisfaction the time consumed by his\r\nantagonist, first at Gesi, and afterwards at the siege of Civitella; and\r\nhe had fully profited by the delay. On reaching the city of Naples, he\r\nhad summoned a parliament of the great barons, had clearly exposed the\r\nnecessities of the state, and demanded an extraordinary loan of two\r\nmillions of ducats. The loyal nobles readily responded to the call; but\r\nas not more than one third of the whole amount could be instantly\r\nraised, an order was obtained from the council, requiring the governors\r\nof the several provinces to invite the great ecclesiastics in their\r\ndistricts to advance the remaining two thirds of the loan. In case they\r\ndid not consent with a good grace, they were to be forced to comply by\r\nthe seizure of their revenues.[162]\r\n\r\nBy another decree of the council, the gold and silver plate belonging to\r\nthe monasteries and churches, throughout the kingdom, after being\r\nvalued, was to be taken for the use of the government. A quantity of it,\r\nbelonging to a city in the Abruzzi, was in fact put up to be sent to\r\nNaples; but it caused such a tumult among the people, that it was found\r\nexpedient to suspend proceedings in the matter for the present.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SIEGE OF CIVITELLA.]\r\n\r\nThe viceroy still further enlarged his resources by the sequestration of\r\nthe revenues belonging to such ecclesiastics as resided in Rome. By\r\nthese various expedients the duke of Alva found himself in possession of\r\nsufficient funds, for carrying on the war as he desired. He mustered a\r\nforce of twenty-two, or, as some accounts state, twenty-five thousand\r\nmen. Of these three thousand only were Spanish veterans, five thousand\r\nwere Germans, and the remainder Italians, chiefly from the Abruzzi,--for\r\nthe most part raw recruits, on whom little reliance was to be placed. He\r\nhad besides seven hundred men-at-arms and fifteen hundred light horse.\r\nHis army, therefore, though, as far as the Italians were concerned,\r\ninferior in discipline to that of his antagonist, was greatly superior\r\nin numbers.[163]\r\n\r\nIn a council of war that was called, some were of opinion that the\r\nviceroy should act on the defensive, and await the approach of the enemy\r\nin the neighborhood of the capital. But Alva looked on this as a timid\r\ncourse, arguing distrust in himself, and likely to infuse distrust into\r\nhis followers. He determined to march at once against the enemy, and\r\nprevent his gaining a permanent foothold in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nPescara, on the Adriatic, was appointed as the place of rendezvous for\r\nthe army, and Alva quitted the city of Naples for that place on the\r\neleventh of April, 1557. Here he concentrated his whole strength, and\r\nreceived his artillery and military stores, which were brought to him by\r\nwater. Having reviewed his troops, he began his march to the north. On\r\nreaching Rio Umano, he detached a strong body of troops to get\r\npossession of Giulia Nuova, a town of some importance lately seized by\r\nthe enemy. Alva supposed, and it seems correctly, that the French\r\ncommander had secured this as a good place of retreat in case of his\r\nfailure before Civitella, since its position was such as would enable\r\nhim readily to keep up his communications with the sea. The French\r\ngarrison sallied out against the Spaniards, but were driven back with\r\nloss; and, as Alva's troops followed in their rear, the enemy fled in\r\nconfusion through the streets of the city, and left it in the hands of\r\nthe victors. In this commodious position, the viceroy for the present\r\ntook up his quarters.\r\n\r\nOn the approach of the Spanish army, the duke of Guise saw the necessity\r\nof bringing his operations against Civitella to a decisive issue. He\r\naccordingly, as a last effort, prepared for a general assault. But,\r\nalthough it was conducted with great spirit, it was repulsed with still\r\ngreater by the garrison; and the French commander, deeply mortified at\r\nhis repeated failures, saw the necessity of abandoning the siege. He\r\ncould not effect even this without sustaining some loss from the brave\r\ndefenders of Civitella, who sallied out on his rear, as he drew off his\r\ndiscomfited troops to the neighboring valley of Nireto. Thus ended the\r\nsiege of Civitella, which, by the confidence it gave to the loyal\r\nNeapolitans throughout the country as well as by the leisure it afforded\r\nto Alva for mustering his resources, may be said to have decided the\r\nfate of the war. The siege lasted twenty-two days, during fourteen of\r\nwhich the guns from the four batteries of the French had played\r\nincessantly on the beleaguered city. The viceroy was filled with\r\nadmiration at the heroic conduct of the inhabitants; and, in token of\r\nrespect for it, granted some important immunities, to be enjoyed for\r\never by the citizens of Civitella. The women, too, came in for their\r\nshare of the honors, as whoever married a maiden of Civitella was to be\r\nallowed the same immunities, from whatever part of the country he might\r\ncome.[164]\r\n\r\nThe two armies were now quartered within a few miles of each other. Yet\r\nno demonstration was made, on either side, of bringing matters to the\r\nissue of a battle. This was foreign to Alva's policy, and was not to be\r\nexpected from Guise, so inferior in strength to his antagonist. On the\r\nviceroy's quitting Giulia Nuova, however, to occupy a position somewhat\r\nnearer the French quarters, Guise did not deem it prudent to remain\r\nthere any longer, but, breaking up his camp, retreated, with his whole\r\narmy, across the Tronto, and, without further delay, evacuated the\r\nkingdom of Naples.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish general made no attempt to pursue, or even to molest his\r\nadversary in his retreat. For this he has been severely criticized, more\r\nparticularly as the passage of a river offers many points of advantage\r\nto an assailant. But, in truth, Alva never resorted to fighting when he\r\ncould gain his end without it. In an appeal to arms, however favorable\r\nmay be the odds, there must always be some doubt as to the result. But\r\nthe odds here were not so decisively on the side of the Spaniards as\r\nthey appeared. The duke of Guise carried off his battalions in admirable\r\norder, protecting his rear with the flower of his infantry and with his\r\ncavalry, in which last he was much superior to his enemy. Thus the parts\r\nof the hostile armies likely to have been brought into immediate\r\nconflict would have afforded no certain assurance of success to the\r\nSpaniards. Alva's object had been, not so much to defeat the French as\r\nto defend Naples. This he had now achieved, with but little loss; and\r\nrather than incur the risk of greater, he was willing, in the words of\r\nan old proverb, to make a bridge of silver for the flying foe.[165] In\r\nthe words of Alva himself, \"he had no idea of staking the kingdom of\r\nNaples against the embroidered coat of the duke of Guise.\"[166]\r\n\r\nOn the retreat of the French, Alva laid siege at once to two or three\r\nplaces, of no great note, in the capture of which he and his lieutenants\r\nwere guilty of the most deliberate cruelty; though, in the judgment of\r\nthe chronicler, it was not cruelty, but a wholesome severity, designed\r\nas a warning to such petty places not to defy the royal authority.[167]\r\nSoon after this, Alva himself crossed the Tronto, and took up a position\r\nnot far removed from the French, who lay in the neighborhood of Ascoli.\r\nAlthough the two armies were but a few miles asunder, there was no\r\nattempt at hostilities, with the exception of a skirmish in which but a\r\nsmall number on either side were engaged, and which terminated in favor\r\nof the Spaniards. This state of things was at length ended by a summons\r\nfrom the pope to the French commander to draw nearer to Rome, as he\r\nneeded his presence for the protection of the capital. The duke, glad,\r\nno doubt, of so honorable an apology for his retreat, and satisfied with\r\nhaving so long held his ground against a force superior to his own, fell\r\nback, in good order, upon Tivoli, which, as it commanded the great\r\navenues to Rome on the east, and afforded good accommodations for his\r\ntroops, he made his head quarters for the present. The manner in which\r\nthe duke of Alva adhered to the plan of defensive operations settled at\r\nthe beginning of the campaign, and that, too, under circumstances which\r\nwould have tempted most men to depart from such a plan, is a remarkable\r\nproof of his perseverance and inflexible spirit. It proves, moreover,\r\nthe empire which he held over the minds of his followers, that, under\r\nsuch circumstances, he could maintain implicit obedience to his orders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROME MENACED BY THE SPANIARDS.]\r\n\r\nThe cause of the pope's alarm was the rapid successes of Alva's\r\nconfederate, Mark Antony Colonna, who had defeated the papal levies,\r\nand taken one place after another in the Campagna, till the Romans began\r\nto tremble for their capital. Colonna was now occupied with the siege of\r\nSegni, a place of considerable importance; and the duke of Alva,\r\nrelieved of the presence of the French, resolved to march to his\r\nsupport. He accordingly recrossed the Tronto, and, passing through the\r\nNeapolitan territory, halted for some days at Sora. He then traversed\r\nthe frontier, but had not penetrated far into the Campagna when he\r\nreceived tidings of the fall of Segni. That strong place, after a\r\ngallant defence, had been taken by storm. All the usual atrocities were\r\nperpetrated by the brutal soldiery. Even the sanctity of the convents\r\ndid not save them from pollution. It was in vain that Colonna interfered\r\nto prevent these excesses. The voice of authority was little heeded in\r\nthe tempest of passion.--It mattered little, in that age, into whose\r\nhands a captured city fell; Germans, French, Italians, it was all the\r\nsame. The wretched town, so lately flourishing, it might be, in all the\r\npride of luxury and wealth, was claimed as the fair spoil of the\r\nvictors. It was their prize-money, which served in default of payment of\r\ntheir long arrears,--usually long in those days; and it was a mode of\r\npayment as convenient for the general as for his soldiers.[168]\r\n\r\nThe fall of Segni caused the greatest consternation in the capital. The\r\nnext thing, it was said, would be to assault the capital itself. Paul\r\nthe Fourth, incapable of fear, was filled with impotent fury. \"They have\r\ntaken Segni,\" he said in a conclave of the cardinals; \"they have\r\nmurdered the people, destroyed their property, fired their dwellings.\r\nWorse than this, they will next pillage Palliano. Even this will not\r\nfill up the measure of their cruelty. They will sack the city of Rome\r\nitself; nor will they respect even my person. But, for myself, I long to\r\nbe with Christ, and await without fear the crown of martyrdom.\"[169]\r\nPaul the Fourth, after having brought this tempest upon Italy, began to\r\nconsider himself a martyr!\r\n\r\nYet even in this extremity, though urged on all sides to make\r\nconcessions, he would abate nothing of his haughty tone. He insisted, as\r\na _sine qua non_, that Alva should forthwith leave the Roman territory\r\nand restore his conquests. When these conditions were reported to the\r\nduke, he coolly remarked, that \"his holiness seemed to be under the\r\nmistake of supposing that his own army was before Naples, instead of the\r\nSpanish army being at the gates of Rome.\"[170]\r\n\r\nAfter the surrender of Segni, Alva effected a junction with the Italian\r\nforces, and marched to the town of Colona, in the Campagna, where for\r\nthe present he quartered his army. Here he formed the plan of an\r\nenterprise, the adventurous character of which it seems difficult to\r\nreconcile with his habitual caution. This was a night assault on Rome.\r\nHe did not communicate his whole purpose to his officers, but simply\r\nordered them to prepare to march on the following night, the\r\ntwenty-sixth of August, against a neighboring city, the name of which he\r\ndid not disclose. It was a wealthy place, he said, but he was most\r\nanxious that no violence should be offered to the inhabitants, in either\r\ntheir persons or property. The soldiers should be forbidden even to\r\nenter the dwellings; but he promised that the loss of booty should be\r\ncompensated by increase of pay. The men were to go lightly armed,\r\nwithout baggage, and with their shirts over their mail, affording the\r\nbest means of recognizing one another in the dark.\r\n\r\nThe night was obscure, but unfortunately a driving storm of rain set in,\r\nwhich did such damage to the roads as greatly to impede the march, and\r\nthe dawn was nigh at hand when the troops reached the place of\r\ndestination. To their great surprise, they then understood that the\r\nobject of attack was Rome itself.\r\n\r\nAlva halted at a short distance from the city, in a meadow, and sent\r\nforward a small party to reconnoitre the capital, which seemed to\r\nslumber in quiet. But, on a nearer approach, the Spaniards saw a great\r\nlight, as if occasioned by a multitude of torches, that seemed glancing\r\nto and fro within the walls, inferring some great stir among the\r\ninhabitants of that quarter. Soon after this, a few horsemen were seen\r\nto issue from one of the gates, and ride off in the direction of the\r\nFrench camp at Tivoli. The duke, on receiving the report, was satisfied\r\nthat the Romans had, in some way or other, got notice of his design;\r\nthat the horsemen had gone to give the alarm to the French in Tivoli;\r\nand that he should soon find himself between two enemies. Not relishing\r\nthis critical position, he at once abandoned his design, and made a\r\nrapid countermarch on the place he had left the preceding evening.\r\n\r\nIn his conjectures the duke was partly in the right and partly in the\r\nwrong. The lights which were seen glancing within the town were owing to\r\nthe watchfulness of Caraffa, who, from some apprehensions of an attack,\r\nin consequence of information he had received of preparations in the\r\nSpanish camp, was patrolling this quarter before daybreak to see that\r\nall was safe; but the horsemen who left the gates at that early hour in\r\nthe direction of the French camp were far from thinking that hostile\r\nbattalions lay within gunshot of their walls.[171]\r\n\r\nSuch is the account we have of this strange affair. Some historians\r\nassert that it was not the duke's design to attack Rome, but only to\r\nmake a feint, and, by the panic which he would create, to afford the\r\npope a good pretext for terminating the war. In support of this, it is\r\nsaid that he told his son Ferdinand, just before his departure, that he\r\nfeared it would be impossible to prevent the troops from sacking the\r\ncity, if they once set foot in it.[172] Other accounts state that it was\r\nno feint, but a surprise meditated in good earnest, and defeated only by\r\nthe apparition of the lights and the seeming state of preparation in\r\nwhich the place was found. Indeed, one writer asserts that he saw the\r\nscaling-ladders, brought by a corps of two hundred arquebusiers, who\r\nwere appointed to the service of mounting the walls.[173]\r\n\r\nThe Venetian minister, Navagero, assures us that Alva's avowed purpose\r\nwas to secure the person of his holiness, which, he thought, must bring\r\nthe war at once to a close. The duke's uncle, the cardinal of\r\nSangiacomo, had warned his nephew, according to the same authority, not\r\nto incur the fate of their countrymen who had served under the Constable\r\nde Bourbon, at the sack of Rome, all of whom, sooner or later, had come\r\nto a miserable end.[174]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROME MENACED BY THE SPANIARDS.]\r\n\r\nThis warning may have made some impression on the mind of Alva, who,\r\nhowever inflexible by nature, had conscientious scruples of his own, and\r\nwas, no doubt, accessible, as others of his time, to arguments founded\r\non superstition.\r\n\r\nWe cannot but admit that the whole affair,--the preparations for the\r\nassault, the counsel to the officers, and the sudden retreat on\r\nsuspicion of a discovery,--all look very much like earnest. It is quite\r\npossible that the duke, as the Venetian asserts, may have intended\r\nnothing beyond the seizure of the pope. But that the matter would have\r\nstopped there, no one will believe. Once fairly within the walls, even\r\nthe authority of Alva would have been impotent to restrain the licence\r\nof the soldiery; and the same scenes might have been acted over again as\r\nat the taking of Rome under the Constable de Bourbon, or on the capture\r\nof the ancient capital by the Goths.\r\n\r\nWhen the Romans, on the following morning, learned the peril they had\r\nbeen in during the night, and that the enemy had been prowling round,\r\nlike wolves about a sheepfold, ready to rush in upon their sleeping\r\nvictims, the whole city was seized with a panic. All the horrors of the\r\nsack by the Constable de Bourbon rose up to their imaginations,--or\r\nrather memories, for many there were who were old enough to remember\r\nthat terrible day. They loudly clamored for peace before it was too\r\nlate; and they pressed the demand in a manner which showed that the mood\r\nof the people was a dangerous one. Strozzi, the most distinguished of\r\nthe Italian captains, plainly told the pope that he had no choice but to\r\ncome to terms with the enemy at once.[175]\r\n\r\nPaul was made more sensible of this by finding now, in his greatest\r\nneed, the very arm withdrawn from him on which he most leaned for\r\nsupport. Tidings had reached the French camp of the decisive victory\r\ngained by the Spaniards at St. Quentin, and they were followed by a\r\nsummons from the king to the duke of Guise, to return with his army, as\r\nspeedily as possible, for the protection of Paris. The duke, who was\r\nprobably not unwilling to close a campaign which had been so barren of\r\nlaurels to the French, declared that \"no chains were strong enough to\r\nkeep him in Italy.\" He at once repaired to the Vatican, and there laid\r\nbefore his holiness the commands of his master. The case was so\r\npressing, that Paul could not in reason oppose the duke's departure. But\r\nhe seldom took counsel of reason, and in a burst of passion exclaimed to\r\nGuise, \"Go, then; and take with you the consciousness of having done\r\nlittle for your king, still less for the Church, and nothing for your\r\nown honor.\"[176]\r\n\r\nNegotiations were now opened for an accommodation between the\r\nbelligerents, at the town of Cavi. Cardinal Caraffa appeared in behalf\r\nof his uncle, the pope, and the duke of Alva for the Spaniards. Through\r\nthe mediation of Venice, the terms of the treaty were finally settled,\r\non the fourteenth of September, although the inflexible pontiff still\r\ninsisted on concessions nearly as extravagant as those he had demanded\r\nbefore. It was stipulated in a preliminary article, that the duke of\r\nAlva should publicly ask pardon, and receive absolution, for having\r\nborne arms against the holy see. \"Sooner than surrender this point,\"\r\nsaid Paul, \"I would see the whole world perish; and this, not so much\r\nfor my own sake as for the honor of Jesus Christ.\"[177]\r\n\r\nIt was provided by the treaty, that the Spanish troops should be\r\nimmediately withdrawn from the territory of the Church, that all the\r\nplaces taken from the Church should be at once restored, and that the\r\nFrench army should be allowed a free passage to their own country.\r\nPhilip did not take so good care of his allies as Paul did of his.\r\nColonna, who had done the cause such good service, was not even\r\nreinstated in the possessions of which the pope had deprived him. But a\r\nsecret article provided that his claims should be determined hereafter\r\nby the joint arbitration of the pontiff and the king of Spain.[178]\r\n\r\nThe treaty was, in truth, one which, as Alva bitterly remarked, \"seemed\r\nto have been dictated by the vanquished rather than by the victor.\" It\r\ncame hard to the duke to execute it, especially the clause relating to\r\nhimself. \"Were I the king,\" said he haughtily, \"his holiness should send\r\none of his nephews to Brussels, to sue for my pardon, instead of my\r\ngeneral's suing for his.\"[179] But Alva had no power to consult his own\r\nwill in the matter. The orders from Philip were peremptory, to come to\r\nsome terms, if possible, with the pope. Philip had long since made up\r\nhis own mind, that neither profit nor honor was to be derived from a war\r\nwith the Church,--a war not only repugnant to his own feelings, but\r\nwhich placed him in a false position, and one most prejudicial to his\r\npolitical interests.\r\n\r\nThe news of peace filled the Romans with a joy great in proportion to\r\ntheir former consternation. Nor was this joy much diminished by a\r\ncalamity which at any other time would have thrown the city into\r\nmourning. The Tiber, swollen by the autumnal rains, rose above its\r\nbanks, sweeping away houses and trees in its fury, drowning men and\r\ncattle, and breaking down a large piece of the wall that surrounded the\r\ncity. It was well that this accident had not occurred a few days\r\nearlier, when the enemy was at the gates.[180]\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-seventh of September, 1557, the duke of Alva made his\r\npublic entrance into Rome. He was escorted by the papal guard, dressed\r\nin its gay uniform. It was joined by the other troops in the city, who,\r\non this holiday service, did as well as better soldiers. On entering the\r\ngates, the concourse was swelled by thousands of citizens, who made the\r\nair ring with their acclamations, as they saluted the Spanish general\r\nwith the titles of Defender and Liberator of the capital. The epithets\r\nmight be thought an indifferent compliment to their own government. In\r\nthis state the procession moved along, like the triumph of a conqueror\r\nreturned from his victorious campaigns to receive the wreath of laurel\r\nin the capitol.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Vatican, the Spanish commander fell on his knees before\r\nthe pope, and asked his pardon for the offence of bearing arms against\r\nthe Church. Paul, soothed by this show of concession, readily granted\r\nabsolution. He paid the duke the distinguished honor of giving him a\r\nseat at his own table; while he complimented the duchess by sending her\r\nthe consecrated golden rose, reserved only for royal persons and\r\nillustrious champions of the Church.[181]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PAUL CONSENTS TO PEACE.]\r\n\r\nYet the haughty spirit of Alva saw in all this more of humiliation than\r\nof triumph. His conscience, like that of his master, was greatly\r\nrelieved by being discharged from the responsibilities of such a war.\r\nBut he had also a military conscience, which seemed to be quite as much\r\nscandalized by the conditions of the peace. He longed to be once more at\r\nNaples, where the state of things imperatively required his presence.\r\nWhen he returned there, he found abundant occupation in reforming the\r\nabuses which had grown out of the late confusion, and especially in\r\nrestoring, as far as possible, the shattered condition of the\r\nfinances,--a task hardly less difficult than that of driving out the\r\nFrench from Naples.[182]\r\n\r\nThus ended the war with Paul the Fourth,--a war into which that pontiff\r\nhad plunged without preparation, which he had conducted without\r\njudgment, and terminated without honor. Indeed, it brought little honor\r\nto any of the parties concerned in it, but, on the other hand, a full\r\nmeasure of those calamities which always follow in the train of war.\r\n\r\nThe French met with the same fate which uniformly befell them, when,\r\nlured by the phantom of military glory, they crossed the Alps to lay\r\nwaste the garden of Italy,--in the words of their own proverb, \"the\r\ngrave of the French.\" The duke of Guise, after a vexatious campaign, in\r\nwhich it was his greatest glory that he had sustained no actual defeat,\r\nthought himself fortunate in being allowed a free passage, with the\r\nshattered remnant of his troops, back to his own country. Naples,\r\nbesides the injuries she had sustained on her borders, was burdened with\r\na debt which continued to press heavily for generations to come. Nor\r\nwere her troubles ended by the peace. In the spring of the following\r\nyear, 1558, a Turkish squadron appeared off Calabria; and, running down\r\nthe coast, the Moslems made a landing on several points, sacked some of\r\nthe principal towns, butchered the inhabitants, or swept them off into\r\nhopeless slavery.[183] Such were some of the blessed fruits of the\r\nalliance between the grand seignior and the head of the Catholic Church.\r\nSolyman had come into the league at the invitation of the Christian\r\nprinces. But it was not found so easy to lay the spirit of mischief as\r\nit had been to raise it.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the war, however, fell, as was just, most heavily on the\r\nauthor of it. Paul, from his palace of the Vatican, could trace the\r\nmarch of the enemy by the smoking ruins of the Campagna. He saw his\r\ntowns sacked, his troops scattered, his very capital menaced, his\r\nsubjects driven by ruinous taxes to the verge of rebellion. Even peace,\r\nwhen it did come, secured to him none of the objects for which he had\r\ncontended, while he had the humiliating consciousness that he owed this\r\npeace, not to his own arms, but to the forbearance--or the superstition\r\nof his enemies. One lesson he might have learned,--that the thunders of\r\nthe Vatican could no longer strike terror into the hearts of princes, as\r\nin the days of the Crusades.\r\n\r\nIn this war Paul had called in the French to aid him in driving out the\r\nSpaniards. The French, he said, might easily be dislodged hereafter;\r\n\"but the Spaniards were like dog-grass, which is sure to strike root\r\nwherever it is cast.\"--This was the last great effort that was made to\r\noverturn the Spanish power in Naples; and the sceptre of that kingdom\r\ncontinued to be transmitted in the dynasty of Castile, with as little\r\nopposition as that of any other portion of its broad empire.\r\n\r\nBeing thus relieved of his military labors, Paul set about those great\r\nreforms, the expectation of which had been the chief inducement to his\r\nelection. But first he gave a singular proof of self-command, in the\r\nreforms which he introduced into his own family. Previously to his\r\nelection, no one, as we have seen, had declaimed more loudly than Paul\r\nagainst nepotism,--the besetting sin of his predecessors, who, most of\r\nthem old men and without children, naturally sought a substitute for\r\nthese in their nephews and those nearest of kin. Paul's partiality for\r\nhis nephews was made the more conspicuous by the profligacy of their\r\ncharacters. Yet the real bond which held the parties together was hatred\r\nof the Spaniards. When peace came, and this bond of union was dissolved,\r\nPaul readily opened his ears to the accusations against his kinsmen.\r\nConvinced at length of their unworthiness, and of the flagrant manner in\r\nwhich they had abused his confidence, he deprived the Caraffas of all\r\ntheir offices, and banished them to the farthest part of his dominions.\r\nBy the sterner sentence of his successor, two of the brothers, the duke\r\nand the cardinal, perished by the hand of the public executioner.[184]\r\n\r\nAfter giving this proof of mastery over his own feelings, Paul addressed\r\nhimself to those reforms which had engaged his attention in early life.\r\nHe tried to enforce a stricter discipline and greater regard for morals,\r\nboth in the religious orders and the secular clergy. Above all, he\r\ndirected his efforts against the Protestant heresy, which had begun to\r\nshow itself in the head of Christendom, as it had long since done in the\r\nextremities. The course he adopted was perfectly characteristic.\r\nScorning the milder methods of argument and persuasion, he resorted\r\nwholly to persecution. The Inquisition, he declared, was the true\r\nbattery with which to assail the defences of the heretic. He suited the\r\naction so well to the word, that in a short time the prisons of the Holy\r\nOffice were filled with the accused. In the general distrust no one felt\r\nhimself safe; and a panic was created, scarcely less than that felt by\r\nthe inhabitants when the Spaniards were at their gates.\r\n\r\nHappily, their fears were dispelled by the death of Paul, which took\r\nplace suddenly, from a fever, on the eighteenth of August, 1559, in the\r\neighty-third year of his age, and fifth of his pontificate. Before the\r\nbreath was out of his body, the populace rose _en masse_, broke open the\r\nprisons of the Inquisition, and liberated all who were confined there.\r\nThey next attacked the house of the grand-inquisitor, which they burned\r\nto the ground; and that functionary narrowly escaped with his life. They\r\ntore down the scutcheons, bearing the arms of the family of Caraffa,\r\nwhich were affixed to the public edifices. They wasted their rage on the\r\nsenseless statue of the pope, which they overturned, and, breaking off\r\nthe head, rolled it, amidst the groans and execrations of the\r\nby-standers, into the Tiber. Such was the fate of the reformer, who, in\r\nhis reforms, showed no touch of humanity, no sympathy with the\r\nsufferings of his species.[185]\r\n\r\nYet, with all its defects, there is something in the character of Paul\r\nthe Fourth that may challenge our admiration. His project--renewing that\r\nof Julius the Second--of driving out the _barbarians_ from Italy, was\r\nnobly conceived, though impracticable. \"Whatever others may feel, I at\r\nleast will have some care for my country,\" he once said to the Venetian\r\nambassador.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ENGLAND JOINS THE WAR WITH FRANCE.]\r\n\r\n\"If my voice is unheeded, it will at least be a consolation to me to\r\nreflect, that it has been raised in such a cause; and that it will one\r\nday be said that an old Italian, on the verge of the grave, who might be\r\nthought to have nothing better to do than to give himself up to repose,\r\nand weep over his sins, had his soul filled with this lofty\r\ndesign.\"[186]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nWAR WITH FRANCE.\r\n\r\nEngland joins in the War.--Philip's Preparations.--Siege of St.\r\nQuentin.--French Army routed.--Storming of St. Quentin.--Successes of\r\nthe Spaniards.\r\n\r\n1557.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the events related in the preceding chapter were passing in Italy,\r\nthe war was waged on a larger scale, and with more important results, in\r\nthe northern provinces of France. As soon as Henry had broken the\r\ntreaty, and sent his army across the Alps, Philip lost no time in\r\nassembling his troops, although in so quiet a manner as to attract as\r\nlittle attention as possible. His preparations were such as enabled him,\r\nnot merely to defend the frontier of the Netherlands, but to carry the\r\nwar into the enemy's country.\r\n\r\nHe despatched his confidential minister, Ruy Gomez, to Spain, for\r\nsupplies both of men and money; instructing him to visit his father,\r\nCharles the Fifth, and, after acquainting him with the state of affairs,\r\nto solicit his aid in raising the necessary funds.[187]\r\n\r\nPhilip had it much at heart to bring England into the war. During his\r\nstay in the Low Countries, he was in constant communication with the\r\nEnglish cabinet, and took a lively interest in the government of the\r\nkingdom. The minutes of the privy council were regularly sent to him,\r\nand as regularly returned with his remarks, in his own handwriting, on\r\nthe margin. In this way he discussed and freely criticized every measure\r\nof importance; and, on one occasion, we find him requiring that nothing\r\nof moment should be brought before parliament until it had first been\r\nsubmitted to him.[188]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1557, Philip paid a second visit to England, where he was\r\nreceived by his fond queen in the most tender and affectionate manner.\r\nIn her letters she had constantly importuned him to return to her. On\r\nthat barren eminence which placed her above the reach of friendship,\r\nMary was dependent on her husband for sympathy and support. But if the\r\nchannel of her affections was narrow, it was deep.\r\n\r\nPhilip found no difficulty in obtaining the queen's consent to his\r\nwishes with respect to the war with France. She was induced to this, not\r\nmerely by her habitual deference to her husband, but by natural feelings\r\nof resentment at the policy of Henry the Second. She had put up with\r\naffronts, more than once, from the French ambassador, in her own court;\r\nand her throne had been menaced by repeated conspiracies, which, if not\r\norganized, had been secretly encouraged by France. Still, it was not\r\neasy to bring the English nation to this way of thinking. It had been a\r\nparticular proviso of the marriage treaty, that England should not be\r\nmade a party to the war against France; and subsequent events had tended\r\nto sharpen the feeling of jealousy rather towards the Spaniards than\r\ntowards the French.\r\n\r\nThe attempted insurrection of Stafford, who crossed over from the shores\r\nof France at this time, did for Philip what possibly neither his own\r\narguments nor the authority of Mary could have done. It was the last of\r\nthe long series of indignities which had been heaped on the country from\r\nthe same quarter; and parliament now admitted that it was no longer\r\nconsistent with its honor to keep terms with a power which persisted in\r\nfomenting conspiracies to overturn the government and plunge the nation\r\ninto civil war. On the seventh of June, a herald was despatched, with\r\nthe formality of ancient and somewhat obsolete usages, to proclaim war\r\nagainst the French king in the presence of his court and in his capital.\r\nThis was done in such a bold tone of defiance, that the hot old\r\nconstable, Montmorency, whose mode of proceeding, as we have seen, was\r\napt to be summary, strongly urged his master to hang up the envoy on the\r\nspot.[189]\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs imperatively demanded Philip's presence in the\r\nNetherlands, and, after a residence of less than four months in London,\r\nhe bade a final adieu to his disconsolate queen, whose excessive\r\nfondness may have been as little to his taste as the coldness of her\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more forlorn than the condition of Mary. Her health\r\nwasting under a disease that cheated her with illusory hopes, which made\r\nher ridiculous in the eyes of the world; her throne, her very life,\r\ncontinually menaced by conspiracies, to some of which even her own\r\nsister was supposed to be privy; her spirits affected by the\r\nconsciousness of the decline of her popularity under the gloomy system\r\nof persecution into which she had been led by her ghostly advisers;\r\nwithout friends, without children, almost it might be said without a\r\nhusband,--she was alone in the world, more to be commiserated than the\r\nmeanest subject in her dominions. She has had little commiseration,\r\nhowever, from Protestant writers, who paint her in the odious colors of\r\na fanatic. This has been compensated, it may be thought, by the Roman\r\nCatholic historians, who have invested the English queen with all the\r\nglories of the saint and the martyr. Experience may convince us that\r\npublic acts do not always furnish a safe criterion of private\r\ncharacter,--especially when these acts are connected with religion. In\r\nthe Catholic Church the individual might seem to be relieved, in some\r\nmeasure, of his moral responsibility, by the system of discipline which\r\nintrusts his conscience to the keeping of his spiritual advisers. If the\r\nlights of the present day allow no man to plead so humiliating an\r\napology, this was not the case in the first half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury,--the age of Mary,--when the Reformation had not yet diffused\r\nthat spirit of independence in religious speculation, which, in some\r\ndegree at least, has now found its way to the darkest corner of\r\nChristendom.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PHILIP'S PREPARATIONS.]\r\n\r\nA larger examination of contemporary documents, especially of the\r\nqueen's own correspondence, justifies the inference, that, with all the\r\ninfirmities of a temper soured by disease, and by the difficulties of\r\nher position, she possessed many of the good qualities of her\r\nillustrious progenitors, Katharine of Aragon and Isabella of Castile;\r\nthe same conjugal tenderness and devotion, the same courage in times of\r\ndanger, the same earnest desire, misguided as she was, to do her\r\nduty,--and, unfortunately, the same bigotry. It was, indeed, most\r\nunfortunate, in Mary's case, as in that of the Catholic queen, that this\r\nbigotry, from their position as independent sovereigns, should have been\r\nattended with such fatal consequences as have left an indelible blot on\r\nthe history of their reigns.[190]\r\n\r\nOn his return to Brussels, Philip busied himself with preparations for\r\nthe campaign. He employed the remittances from Spain to subsidize a\r\nlarge body of German mercenaries. Germany was the country which\r\nfurnished, at this time, more soldiers of fortune than any other; men\r\nwho served indifferently under the banner that would pay them best. They\r\nwere not exclusively made up of infantry, like the Swiss, but, besides\r\npikemen,--_lanzknechts_,--they maintained a stout array of cavalry,\r\n_reiters_, as they were called,--\"riders,\"--who, together with the\r\ncuirass and other defensive armor, carried pistols, probably of rude\r\nworkmanship, but which made them formidable from the weapon being little\r\nknown in that day. They were, indeed, the most dreaded troops of their\r\ntime. The men-at-arms, encumbered with their unwieldy lances, were drawn\r\nup in line, and required an open plain to manoeuvre to advantage, being\r\neasily discomposed by obstacles; and once broken, they could hardly\r\nrally. But the _reiters_, each with five or six pistols in his belt,\r\nwere formed into columns of considerable depth, the size of their\r\nweapons allowing them to go through all the evolutions of light cavalry,\r\nin which they were perfectly drilled. Philip's cavalry was further\r\nstrengthened by a fine corps of Burgundian lances, and by a great number\r\nof nobles and cavaliers from Spain, who had come to gather laurels in\r\nthe fields of France, under the eye of their young sovereign. The flower\r\nof his infantry, too, was drawn from Spain; men who, independently of\r\nthe indifference to danger, and wonderful endurance, which made the\r\nSpanish soldier inferior to none of the time, were animated by that\r\nloyalty to the cause which foreign mercenaries could not feel. In\r\naddition to these, the king expected, and soon after received, a\r\nreinforcement of eight thousand English under the earl of Pembroke. They\r\nmight well fight bravely on the soil where the arms of England had won\r\ntwo of the most memorable victories in her history.\r\n\r\nThe whole force, exclusive of the English, amounted to thirty-five\r\nthousand foot and twelve thousand horse, besides a good train of\r\nbattering artillery.[191] The command of this army was given to Emanuel\r\nPhilibert, prince of Piedmont, better known by his title of duke of\r\nSavoy. No man had a larger stake in the contest, for he had been\r\nstripped of his dominions by the French, and his recovery of them\r\ndepended on the issue of the war. He was at this time but twenty-nine\r\nyears of age; but he had had large experience in military affairs, and\r\nhad been intrusted by Charles the Fifth, who had early discerned his\r\ncapacity, with important commands. His whole life may be said to have\r\ntrained him for the profession of arms. He had no taste for effeminate\r\npleasures, but amused himself, in seasons of leisure, with the hardy\r\nexercise of the chase. He strengthened his constitution, naturally not\r\nvery robust, by living as much as possible in the open air. Even when\r\nconversing, or dictating to his secretaries, he preferred to do so\r\nwalking in his garden. He was indifferent to fatigue. After hunting all\r\nday he would seem to require no rest, and in a campaign had been known,\r\nlike the knights-errant of old, to eat, drink, and sleep in his armor\r\nfor thirty days together.\r\n\r\nHe was temperate in his habits, eating little, and drinking water. He\r\nwas punctual in attention to business, was sparing of his words, and, as\r\none may gather from the piquant style of his letters, had a keen insight\r\ninto character, looking below the surface of men's actions into their\r\nmotives.[192]\r\n\r\nHis education had not been neglected. He spoke several languages\r\nfluently, and, though not a great reader, was fond of histories. He was\r\nmuch devoted to mathematical science, which served him in his\r\nprofession, and he was reputed an excellent engineer.[193] In person the\r\nduke was of the middle size; well-made, except that he was somewhat\r\nbow-legged. His complexion was fair, his hair light, and his deportment\r\nvery agreeable.\r\n\r\nSuch is the portrait of Emanuel Philibert, to whom Philip now intrusted\r\nthe command of his forces, and whose pretensions he warmly supported as\r\nthe suitor of Elizabeth of England. There was none more worthy of the\r\nroyal maiden. But the duke was a Catholic; and Elizabeth, moreover, had\r\nseen the odium which her sister had incurred by her marriage with a\r\nforeign sovereign. Philip, who would have used some constraint in the\r\nmatter, pressed it with such earnestness on the queen as proved how much\r\nimportance he attached to the connection. Mary's conduct on the occasion\r\nwas greatly to her credit; and, while she deprecated the displeasure of\r\nher lord, she honestly told him that she could not in conscience do\r\nviolence to the inclinations of her sister.[194]\r\n\r\nThe plan of the campaign, as determined by Philip's cabinet,[195] was\r\nthat the duke should immediately besiege some one of the great towns on\r\nthe northern borders of Picardy, which in a manner commanded the\r\nentrance into the Netherlands. Rocroy was the first selected. But the\r\ngarrison, who were well provided with ammunition, kept within their\r\ndefences, and maintained so lively a cannonade on the Spaniards, that\r\nthe duke, finding the siege was likely to consume more time than it was\r\nworth, broke up his camp, and resolved to march against St. Quentin.\r\nThis was an old frontier town of Picardy, important in time of peace as\r\nan _entrepôt_ for the trade that was carried on between France and the\r\nLow Countries. It formed a convenient place of deposit, at the present\r\nperiod, for such booty as marauding parties from time to time brought\r\nback from Flanders. It was well protected by its natural situation, and\r\nthe fortifications had been originally strong; but, as in many of the\r\nfrontier towns, they had been of late years much neglected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SIEGE OF ST. QUENTIN.]\r\n\r\nBefore beginning operations against St. Quentin, the duke of Savoy, in\r\norder to throw the enemy off his guard, and prevent his introducing\r\nsupplies into the town, presented himself before Guise, and made a show\r\nof laying siege to that place. After this demonstration he resumed his\r\nmarch, and suddenly sat down before St. Quentin, investing it with his\r\nwhole army.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the French had been anxiously watching the movements of their\r\nadversary. Their forces were assembled on several points in Picardy and\r\nChampagne. The principal corps was under the command of the duke of\r\nNevers, governor of the latter province, a nobleman of distinguished\r\ngallantry, and who had seen some active service. He now joined his\r\nforces to those under Montmorency, the constable of France, who occupied\r\na central position in Picardy, and who now took the command, for which\r\nhis rash and impetuous temper but indifferently qualified him. As soon\r\nas the object of the Spaniards was known, it was resolved to reinforce\r\nthe garrison of St. Quentin, which otherwise, it was understood, could\r\nnot hold out a week. This perilous duty was assumed by Gaspard de\r\nColigni, admiral of France.[196] This personage, the head of an ancient\r\nand honored house, was one of the most remarkable men of his time. His\r\nname had gained a mournful celebrity in the page of history, as that of\r\nthe chief martyr in the massacre of St. Bartholomew. He embraced the\r\ndoctrines of Calvin, and by his austere manners and the purity of his\r\nlife well illustrated the doctrines he embraced. The decent order of his\r\nhousehold, and their scrupulous attention to the services of religion,\r\nformed a striking contrast to the licentious conduct of too many of the\r\nCatholics, who, however, were as prompt as Coligni to do battle in\r\ndefence of their faith. In early life he was the gay companion of the\r\nduke of Guise.[197] But as the Calvinists, or Huguenots, were driven by\r\npersecution to an independent and even hostile position, the two\r\nfriends, widely separated by opinion and by interest, were changed into\r\nmortal foes. That hour had not yet come. But the heresy that was soon to\r\nshake France to its centre was silently working under ground.\r\n\r\nAs the admiral was well instructed in military affairs, and was\r\npossessed of an intrepid spirit and great fertility of resource, he was\r\nprecisely the person to undertake the difficult office of defending St.\r\nQuentin. As governor of Picardy he felt this to be his duty. Without\r\nloss of time, he put himself at the head of some ten or twelve hundred\r\nmen, horse and foot, and used such despatch that he succeeded in\r\nentering the place before it had been entirely invested. He had the\r\nmortification, however, to be followed only by seven hundred of his men,\r\nthe remainder having failed through fatigue, or mistaken the path.\r\n\r\nThe admiral found the place in even worse condition than he had\r\nexpected. The fortifications were much dilapidated; and in many parts of\r\nthe wall the masonry was of so flimsy a character, that it must have\r\nfallen before the first discharge of the enemy's cannon. The town was\r\nvictualled for three weeks, and the magazines were tolerably well\r\nsupplied with ammunition. But there were not fifty arquebuses fit for\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nSt. Quentin stands on a gentle eminence, protected on one side by\r\nmarshes, or rather a morass of great extent, through which flows the\r\nriver Somme, or a branch of it. On the same side of the river with St.\r\nQuentin lay the army of the besiegers, with their glittering lines\r\nextending to the very verge of the morass. A broad ditch defended the\r\nouter wall. But this ditch was commanded by the houses of the suburbs,\r\nwhich had already been taken possession of by the besiegers. There was,\r\nmoreover, a thick plantation of trees close to the town, which would\r\nafford an effectual screen for the approach of an enemy.\r\n\r\nOne of the admiral's first acts was to cause a sortie to be made. The\r\nditch was crossed, and some of the houses were burned to the ground. The\r\ntrees on the banks were then levelled, and the approach to the town was\r\nlaid open. Every preparation was made for a protracted defence. The\r\nexact quantity of provision was ascertained, and the rations were\r\nassigned for each man's daily consumption. As the supplies were\r\ninadequate to support the increased population for any length of time,\r\nColigni ordered that all except those actively engaged in the defence of\r\nthe place should leave it without delay. Many, under one pretext or\r\nanother, contrived to remain, and share the fortunes of the garrison.\r\nBut by this regulation he got rid of seven hundred useless persons, who,\r\nif they had staid, must have been the victims of famine; and \"their dead\r\nbodies,\" the admiral coolly remarked, \"would have bred a pestilence\r\namong the soldiers.\"[198]\r\n\r\nHe assigned to his men their several posts, talked boldly of maintaining\r\nhimself against all the troops of Spain, and by his cheerful tone\r\nendeavored to inspire a confidence in others which he was far from\r\nfeeling himself. From one of the highest towers he surveyed the\r\nsurrounding country, tried to ascertain the most practicable fords in\r\nthe morass, and sent intelligence to Montmorency, that, without relief,\r\nthe garrison could not hold out more than a few days.[199]\r\n\r\nThat commander, soon after the admiral's departure, had marched his army\r\nto the neighborhood of St. Quentin, and established it in the towns of\r\nLa Fère and Ham, together with the adjoining villages, so as to watch\r\nthe movements of the Spaniards, and coöperate, as occasion served, with\r\nthe besieged. He at once determined to strengthen the garrison, if\r\npossible, by a reinforcement of two thousand men under Dandelot, a\r\nyounger brother of the admiral, and not inferior to him in audacity and\r\nenterprise. But the expedition miserably failed. Through the treachery\r\nor the ignorance of the guide, the party mistook the path, came on one\r\nof the enemy's outposts, and, disconcerted by the accident, were thrown\r\ninto confusion, and many of them cut to pieces or drowned in the morass.\r\nTheir leader, with the remainder, succeeded, under cover of the night,\r\nin making his way back to La Fère.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BATTLE OF ST. QUENTIN.]\r\n\r\nThe constable now resolved to make another attempt, and in the open day.\r\nHe proposed to send a body, under the same commander, in boats across\r\nthe Somme, and to cover the embarkation in person with his whole army.\r\nHis force was considerably less than that of the Spaniards, amounting\r\nin all to about eighteen thousand foot and six thousand horse, besides a\r\ntrain of artillery consisting of sixteen guns.[200] His levies, like\r\nthose of his antagonist, were largely made up of German mercenaries. The\r\nFrench peasantry, with the exception of the Gascons, who formed a fine\r\nbody of infantry, had long since ceased to serve in war. But the\r\nchivalry of France was represented by as gallant an array of nobles and\r\ncavaliers as ever fought under the banner of the lilies.\r\n\r\nOn the ninth of August, 1557, Montmorency put his whole army in motion;\r\nand on the following morning, the memorable day of St. Lawrence, by nine\r\no'clock, he took up a position on the bank of the Somme. On the opposite\r\nside, nearest the town, lay the Spanish force, covering the ground, as\r\nfar as the eye could reach, with their white pavilions; while the\r\nbanners of Spain, of Flanders, and of England, unfurled in the morning\r\nbreeze, showed the various nations from which the motley host had been\r\ngathered.[201]\r\n\r\nOn the constable's right was a windmill, commanding a ford of the river\r\nwhich led to the Spanish quarters. The building was held by a small\r\ndetachment of the enemy. Montmorency's first care was to get possession\r\nof the mill, which he did without difficulty; and, by placing a garrison\r\nthere, under the prince of Condé, he secured himself from surprise in\r\nthat quarter. He then profited by a rising ground to get his guns in\r\nposition, so as to sweep the opposite bank, and at once opened a brisk\r\ncannonade on the enemy. The march of the French had been concealed by\r\nsome intervening hills, so that, when they suddenly appeared on the\r\nfarther side of the Somme, it was as if they had dropped from the\r\nclouds; and the shot which fell among the Spaniards threw them into\r\ngreat disorder. There was hurrying to and fro, and some of the balls\r\nstriking the duke of Savoy's tent, he had barely time to escape with his\r\narmor in his hand. It was necessary to abandon his position, and he\r\nmarched some three miles down the river, to the quarters occupied by the\r\ncommander of the cavalry, Count Egmont.[202]\r\n\r\nMontmorency, as much elated with this cheap success as if it had been a\r\nvictory, now set himself about passing his troops across the water. It\r\nwas attended with more difficulty than he had expected. There were no\r\nboats in readiness, and two hours were wasted in procuring them. After\r\nall, only four or five could be obtained, and these so small that it\r\nwould be necessary to cross and recross the stream many times to effect\r\nthe object. The boats, crowded with as many as they could carry, stuck\r\nfast in the marshy banks, or rather quagmire, on the opposite side; and\r\nwhen some of the soldiers jumped out to lighten the load, they were\r\nswallowed up and suffocated in the mud.[203] To add to these\r\ndistresses, they were galled by the incessant fire of a body of troops\r\nwhich the Spanish general had stationed on an eminence that commanded\r\nthe landing.\r\n\r\nWhile, owing to these causes, the transportation of the troops was going\r\nslowly on, the duke of Savoy had called a council of war, and determined\r\nthat the enemy, since he had ventured so near, should not be allowed to\r\nescape without a battle. There was a practicable ford in the river,\r\nclose to Count Egmont's quarters; and that officer received orders to\r\ncross it at the head of his cavalry, and amuse the enemy until the main\r\nbody of the Spanish army, under the duke, should have time to come up.\r\n\r\nLamoral, Count Egmont, and prince of Gavre, a person who is to occupy a\r\nlarge space in our subsequent pages, was a Flemish noble of an ancient\r\nand illustrious lineage. He had early attracted the notice of the\r\nemperor, who had raised him to various important offices, both civil and\r\nmilitary, in which he had acquitted himself with honor. At this time,\r\nwhen thirty-five years old, he held the post of lieutenant-general of\r\nthe horse, and that of governor of Flanders.\r\n\r\nEgmont was of a lofty and aspiring nature, filled with dreams of glory,\r\nand so much elated by success, that the duke of Savoy was once obliged\r\nto rebuke him, by reminding him that he was not the commander-in-chief\r\nof the army.[204] With these defects he united some excellent qualities,\r\nwhich not unfrequently go along with them. In his disposition he was\r\nfrank and manly, and, though hasty in temper, had a warm and generous\r\nheart. He was distinguished by a chivalrous bearing, and a showy,\r\nimposing address, which took with the people, by whom his name was held\r\ndear in later times for his devotion to the cause of freedom. He was a\r\ndashing officer, prompt and intrepid, well fitted for a brilliant\r\n_coup-de-main_, or for an affair like the present, which required energy\r\nand despatch; and he eagerly undertook the duty assigned him.\r\n\r\nThe light horse first passed over the ford, the existence of which was\r\nknown to Montmorency; and he had detached a corps of German pistoleers,\r\nof whom there was a body in the French service, to defend the passage.\r\nBut the number was too small, and the Burgundian horse, followed by the\r\ninfantry, advanced, in face of the fire, as coolly and in as good order\r\nas if they had been on parade.[205] The constable soon received tidings\r\nthat the enemy had begun to cross; and, aware of his mistake, he\r\nreinforced his pistoleers with a squadron of horse under the duc de\r\nNevers. It was too late; when the French commander reached the ground,\r\nthe enemy had already crossed in such strength that it would have been\r\nmadness to attack him. After a brief consultation with his officers,\r\nNevers determined, by as speedy a countermarch as possible, to join the\r\nmain body of the army.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BATTLE OF ST. QUENTIN.]\r\n\r\nThe prince of Condé, as has been mentioned, occupied the mill which\r\ncommanded the other ford, on the right of Montmorency. From its summit\r\nhe could descry the movements of the Spaniards, and their battalions\r\ndebouching on the plain, with scarcely any opposition from the French.\r\nHe advised the constable of this at once, and suggested the necessity of\r\nan immediate retreat. The veteran did not relish advice from one so much\r\nyounger than himself, and testily replied, \"I was a soldier before the\r\nprince of Condé was born; and, by the blessing of Heaven, I trust to\r\nteach him some good lessons in war for many a year to come.\" Nor would\r\nhe quit the ground while a man of the reinforcement under Dandelot\r\nremained to cross.[206]\r\n\r\nThe cause of this fatal confidence was information he had received that\r\nthe ford was too narrow to allow more than four or five persons to pass\r\nabreast, which would give him time enough to send over the troops, and\r\nthen secure his own retreat to La Fère. As it turned out, unfortunately,\r\nthe ford was wide enough to allow fifteen or twenty men to go abreast.\r\n\r\nThe French, meanwhile, who had crossed the river, after landing on the\r\nopposite bank, were many of them killed or disabled by the Spanish\r\narquebusiers; others were lost in the morass; and of the whole number\r\nnot more than four hundred and fifty, wet, wounded, and weary, with\r\nDandelot at their head, succeeded in throwing themselves into St.\r\nQuentin. The constable, having seen the last boat put off, gave instant\r\norders for retreat. The artillery was sent forward in the front, then\r\nfollowed the infantry, and, last of all, he brought up the rear with the\r\nhorse, of which he took command in person. He endeavored to make up for\r\nthe precious time he had lost by quickening his march, which, however,\r\nwas retarded by the heavy guns in the van.\r\n\r\nThe duc de Nevers, as we have seen, declining to give battle to the\r\nSpaniards who had crossed the stream, had prepared to retreat on the\r\nmain body of the army. On reaching the ground lately occupied by his\r\ncountrymen, he found it abandoned; and joining Condé, who still held the\r\nmill, the two officers made all haste to overtake the constable.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Count Egmont, as soon as he was satisfied that he was in\r\nsufficient strength to attack the enemy, gave orders to advance, without\r\nwaiting for more troops to share with him the honors of victory.\r\nCrossing the field lately occupied by the constable, he took the great\r\nroad to La Fère. But the rising ground which lay between him and the\r\nFrench prevented him from seeing the enemy until he had accomplished\r\nhalf a league or more. The day was now well advanced, and the Flemish\r\ncaptain had some fears that, notwithstanding his speed, the quarry had\r\nescaped him. But, as he turned the hill, he had the satisfaction to\r\ndescry the French columns in full retreat. On their rear hung a body of\r\nsutlers and other followers of the camp, who, by the sudden apparition\r\nof the Spaniards, were thrown into a panic, which they had wellnigh\r\ncommunicated to the rest of the army.[207] To retreat before an enemy is\r\nin itself a confession of weakness sufficiently dispiriting to the\r\nsoldier. Montmorency, roused by the tumult, saw the dark cloud gathering\r\nalong the heights, and knew that it must soon burst on him. In this\r\nemergency, he asked counsel of an old officer near him as to what he\r\nshould do. \"Had you asked me,\" replied the other, \"two hours since, I\r\ncould have told you; it is now too late.\"[208] It was indeed too late,\r\nand there was nothing to be done but to face about and fight the\r\nSpaniards. The constable, accordingly, gave the word to halt, and made\r\ndispositions to receive his assailants.\r\n\r\nEgmont, seeing him thus prepared, formed his own squadron into three\r\ndivisions. One, which was to turn the left flank of the French, he gave\r\nto the prince of Brunswick and to Count Hoorne,--a name afterwards\r\nassociated with his own on a sadder occasion than the present. Another,\r\ncomposed chiefly of Germans, he placed under Count Mansfeldt, with\r\norders to assail the centre. He himself, at the head of his Burgundian\r\nlances, rode on the left against Montmorency's right flank. Orders were\r\nthen given to charge, and, spurring forward their horses, the whole\r\ncolumn came thundering on against the enemy. The French met the shock\r\nlike well-trained soldiers, as they were; but the cavalry fell on them\r\nwith the fury of a torrent sweeping everything before it, and for a few\r\nmoments it seemed as if all were lost. But the French chivalry was true\r\nto its honor, and, at the call of Montmorency, who gallantly threw\r\nhimself into the thick of the fight, it rallied, and, returning the\r\ncharge, compelled the assailants to give way in their turn. The\r\nstruggle, now continued on more equal terms, grew desperate; man against\r\nman, horse against horse,--it seemed to be a contest of personal\r\nprowess, rather than of tactics or military science. So well were the\r\ntwo parties matched, that for a long time the issue was doubtful; and\r\nthe Spaniards might not have prevailed in the end, but for the arrival\r\nof reinforcements, both foot and heavy cavalry, who came up to their\r\nsupport. Unable to withstand this accumulated force, the French\r\ncavaliers, overpowered by numbers, not by superior valor, began to give\r\nground. Hard pressed by Egmont, who cheered on his men to renewed\r\nefforts, their ranks were at length broken. The retreat became a flight;\r\nand, scattered over the field in all directions, they were hotly pursued\r\nby their adversaries, especially the German _schwarzreiters_,--those\r\nriders \"black as devils,\"[209]--who did such execution with their\r\nfire-arms as completed the discomfiture of the French.\r\n\r\nAmidst this confusion, the Gascons, the flower of the French infantry,\r\nbehaved with admirable coolness.[210] Throwing themselves into squares,\r\nwith the pikemen armed with their long pikes in front, and the\r\narquebusiers in the centre, they presented an impenetrable array,\r\nagainst which the tide of battle raged and chafed in impotent fury. It\r\nwas in vain that the Spanish horse rode round the solid masses bristling\r\nwith steel, if possible, to force an entrance, while an occasional shot,\r\nstriking a trooper from his saddle, warned them not to approach too\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nIt was in this state of things that the duke of Savoy, with the\r\nremainder of the troops, including the artillery, came on the field of\r\naction. His arrival could not have been more seasonable. The heavy guns\r\nwere speedily turned on the French squares, whose dense array presented\r\nan obvious mark to the Spanish bullets. Their firm ranks were rent\r\nasunder; and, as the brave men tried in vain to close over the bodies of\r\ntheir dying comrades, the horse took advantage of the openings to plunge\r\ninto the midst of the phalanx. Here the long spears of the pikemen were\r\nof no avail, and, striking right and left, the cavaliers dealt death on\r\nevery side. All now was confusion and irretrievable ruin. No one thought\r\nof fighting, or even of self-defence. The only thought was of flight.\r\nMen overturned one another in their eagerness to escape. They were soon\r\nmingled with the routed cavalry, who rode down their own countrymen.\r\nHorses ran about the field without riders. Many of the soldiers threw\r\naway their arms, to fly the more quickly. All strove to escape from the\r\nterrible pursuit which hung on their rear. The artillery and\r\nammunition-wagons choked up the road, and obstructed the flight of the\r\nfugitives. The slaughter was dreadful. The best blood of France flowed\r\nlike water.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ARMY ROUTED.]\r\n\r\nYet mercy was shown to those who asked it. Hundreds and thousands threw\r\ndown their arms, and obtained quarter. Nevers, according to some\r\naccounts, covered the right flank of the French army. Others state that\r\nhe was separated from it by a ravine or valley. At all events, he fared\r\nno better than his leader. He was speedily enveloped by the cavalry of\r\nHoorne and Brunswick, and his fine corps of light horse cut to pieces.\r\nHe himself, with the prince of Condé, was so fortunate as to make his\r\nescape, with the remnant of his forces, to La Fère.\r\n\r\nHad the Spaniards followed up the pursuit, few Frenchmen might have been\r\nleft that day to tell the story of the rout of St. Quentin. But the\r\nfight had already lasted four hours; evening was setting in; and the\r\nvictors, spent with toil and sated with carnage, were content to take up\r\ntheir quarters on the field of battle.\r\n\r\nThe French, in the mean time, made their way, one after another, to La\r\nFère, and, huddling together in the public squares, or in the quarters\r\nthey had before occupied, remained like a herd of panic-struck deer, in\r\nwhose ears the sounds of the chase are still ringing. But the loyal\r\ncavaliers threw off their panic, and recovered heart, when a rumor\r\nreached them that their commander, Montmorency, was still making head,\r\nwith a body of stout followers, against the enemy. At the tidings, faint\r\nand bleeding as they were, they sprang to the saddles which they had\r\njust quitted, and were ready again to take the field.[211]\r\n\r\nBut the rumor was without foundation. Montmorency was a prisoner in the\r\nhands of the Spaniards. The veteran had exposed his own life throughout\r\nthe action, as if willing to show that he would not shrink in any degree\r\nfrom the peril into which he had brought his followers. When he saw that\r\nthe day was lost, he threw himself into the hottest of the battle,\r\nholding life cheap in comparison with honor. A shot from the pistol of a\r\n_schwarzreiter_, fracturing his thigh, disabled him from further\r\nresistance; and he fell into the hands of the Spaniards, who treated him\r\nwith the respect due to his rank. The number of prisoners was very\r\nlarge,--according to some accounts, six thousand, of whom six hundred\r\nwere said to be gentlemen and persons of condition. The number of the\r\nslain is stated, as usual, with great discrepancy, varying from three to\r\nsix thousand. A much larger proportion of them than usual were men of\r\nfamily. Many a noble house in France went into mourning for that day.\r\nAmong those who fell was Jean de Bourbon, count d'Enghien, a prince of\r\nthe blood. Mortally wounded, he was carried to the tent of the duke of\r\nSavoy, where he soon after expired, and his body was sent to his\r\ncountrymen at La Fère for honorable burial. To balance this bloody roll,\r\nno account states the loss of the Spaniards at over a thousand men.[212]\r\n\r\nMore than eighty standards, including those of the cavalry, fell into\r\nthe hands of the victors, together with all the artillery,\r\nammunition-wagons, and baggage of the enemy. France had not experienced\r\nsuch a defeat since the battle of Agincourt.[213]\r\n\r\nKing Philip had left Brussels, and removed his quarters to Cambray, that\r\nhe might be near the duke of Savoy, with whom he kept up daily\r\ncommunication throughout the siege. Immediately after the battle, on the\r\neleventh of August, he visited the camp in person. At the same time, he\r\nwrote to his father, expressing his regret that he had not been there to\r\nshare the glory of the day.[214] The emperor seems to have heartily\r\nshared this regret.[215] It is quite certain, if Charles had had the\r\ndirection of affairs, he would not have been absent. But Philip had not\r\nthe bold, adventurous spirit of his father. His talent lay rather in\r\nmeditation than in action; and his calm, deliberate forecast better\r\nfitted him for the council than the camp. In enforcing levies, in\r\nraising supplies, in superintending the organization of the army, he was\r\nindefatigable. The plan of the campaign was determined under his own\r\neye; and he was most sagacious in the selection of his agents. But to\r\nthose agents he prudently left the conduct of the war, for which he had\r\nno taste, perhaps no capacity, himself. He did not, like his rival,\r\nHenry the Second, fancy himself a great captain because he could carry\r\naway the prizes of a tourney.\r\n\r\nPhilip was escorted to the camp by his household troops. He appeared on\r\nthis occasion armed _cap-à-pie_,--a thing by no means common with him.\r\nIt seems to have pleased his fancy to be painted in military costume. At\r\nleast, there are several portraits of him in complete mail,--one from\r\nthe pencil of Titian. A picture taken at the present time was sent by\r\nhim to Queen Mary, who, in this age of chivalry, may have felt some\r\npride in seeing her lord in the panoply of war.\r\n\r\nOn the king's arrival at the camp, he was received with all the honors\r\nof a victor; with flourishes of trumpets, salvos of artillery, and the\r\nloud shouts of the soldiery. The duke of Savoy laid at his feet the\r\nbanners and other trophies of the fight, and, kneeling down, would have\r\nkissed Philip's hand; but the king, raising him from the ground, and\r\nembracing him as he did so, said that the acknowledgments were due from\r\nhimself to the general who had won him such a victory. At the same time,\r\nhe paid a well-deserved compliment to the brilliant part which Egmont\r\nand his brave companions had borne in the battle.[216]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRENCH ARMY ROUTED.]\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done was to dispose of the prisoners, whose number\r\nembarrassed the conquerors. Philip dismissed all those of the common\r\nfile, on the condition that they should not bear arms for six months\r\nagainst the Spaniards. The condition did no great detriment to the\r\nFrench service, as the men, on their return, were sent to garrison some\r\ndistant towns, and their places in the army filled by the troops whom\r\nthey had relieved. The cavaliers and persons of condition were lodged in\r\nfortresses, where they could be securely detained till the amount of\r\ntheir respective ransoms was determined. These ransoms formed an\r\nimportant part of the booty of the conqueror. How important, may be\r\ninferred from the sum offered by the constable on his own account and\r\nthat of his son,--no less, it is said, than a hundred and sixty-five\r\nthousand gold crowns.[217] The soldier of that day, when the penalty was\r\nloss of fortune as well as of freedom, must be confessed to have fought\r\non harder conditions than at present.\r\n\r\nA council of war was next called, to decide on further operations. When\r\nCharles the Fifth received tidings of the victory of St. Quentin, the\r\nfirst thing he asked, as we are told, was \"whether Philip were at\r\nParis.\"[218] Had Charles been in command, he would doubtless have\r\nfollowed up the blow by presenting himself at once before the French\r\ncapital. But Philip was not of that sanguine temper which overlooks, or\r\nat least overleaps, the obstacles in its way. Charles calculated the\r\nchances of success; Philip, those of failure. Charles's character opened\r\nthe way to more brilliant achievements, but exposed him also to severer\r\nreverses. His enterprising spirit was more favorable to building up a\r\ngreat empire; the cautious temper of Philip was better fitted to\r\npreserve it. Philip came in the right time; and his circumspect policy\r\nwas probably better suited to his position, as well as to his character,\r\nthan the bolder policy of the emperor.\r\n\r\nWhen the duke of Savoy urged, as it is said, the expediency of profiting\r\nby the present panic to march at once on the French capital, Philip\r\nlooked at the dangers of such a step. Several strong fortresses of the\r\nenemy would be left in his rear. Rivers must be crossed, presenting\r\nlines of defence which could easily be maintained against a force even\r\nsuperior to his own. Paris was covered by formidable works, and forty\r\nthousand citizens could be enrolled, at the shortest notice, for its\r\nprotection. It was not wise to urge the foe to extremity, to force a\r\nbrave and loyal people, like the French, to rise _en masse_, as they\r\nwould do for the defence of their capital. The emperor, his father, had\r\nonce invaded France with a powerful army, and laid siege to Marseilles.\r\nThe issue of that invasion was known to everybody. \"The Spaniards,\" it\r\nwas tauntingly said, \"had come into the country feasting on turkeys;\r\nthey were glad to escape from it feeding on roots!\"[219] Philip\r\ndetermined, therefore, to abide by his original plan of operations, and\r\nprofit by the late success of his arms to press the siege of St. Quentin\r\nwith his whole force.--It would not be easy for any one, at this\r\ndistance of time, to pronounce on the wisdom of his decision. But\r\nsubsequent events tend considerably to strengthen our confidence in it.\r\n\r\nPreparations were now made to push the siege with vigor. Besides the\r\ncannon already in the camp, and those taken in the battle, a good number\r\nof pieces were brought from Cambray to strengthen the battering-train\r\nof the besiegers. The river was crossed; and the Faubourg d'Ile was\r\ncarried by the duke, after a stout resistance on the part of the French,\r\nwho burned the houses in their retreat. The Spanish commander availed\r\nhimself of his advantage to establish batteries close to the town, which\r\nkept up an incessant cannonade, that shook the old walls and towers to\r\ntheir foundation. The miners also carried on their operations, and\r\ngalleries were excavated almost to the centre of the place.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the besieged, in the mean time, was forlorn in the\r\nextreme; not so much from want of food, though their supplies were\r\nscanty, as from excessive toil and exposure. Then it was that Coligni\r\ndisplayed all the strength of his character. He felt the importance of\r\nholding out as long as possible, that the nation might have time to\r\nbreathe, as it were, and recover from the late disaster. He endeavored\r\nto infuse his own spirit into the hearts of his soldiers, toiling with\r\nthe meanest of them, and sharing all their privations. He cheered the\r\ndesponding, by assuring them of speedy relief from their countrymen.\r\nSome he complimented for their bravery; others he flattered by asking\r\ntheir advice. He talked loudly of the resources at his command. If any\r\nshould hear him so much as hint at a surrender, he gave them leave to\r\ntie him hand and foot, and throw him into the moat. If he should hear\r\none of them talk of it, the admiral promised to do as much by him.[220]\r\n\r\nThe duc de Nevers, who had established himself, with the wreck of the\r\nFrench army and such additional levies as he could muster, in the\r\nneighborhood of St. Quentin, contrived to communicate with the admiral.\r\nOn one occasion he succeeded in throwing a reinforcement of a hundred\r\nand twenty arquebusiers into the town, though it cost him thrice that\r\nnumber, cut to pieces by the Spaniards in the attempt. Still the number\r\nof the garrison was altogether inadequate to the duties imposed on it.\r\nWith scanty refreshment, almost without repose, watching and fighting by\r\nturns, the day passed in defending the breaches which the night was not\r\nlong enough to repair. No frame could be strong enough to endure it.\r\n\r\nColigni had, fortunately, the services of a skilful engineer, named St.\r\nRémy, who aided him in repairing the injuries inflicted on the works by\r\nthe artillery, and by the scarcely less destructive mines of the\r\nSpaniards. In the want of solid masonry, every material was resorted to\r\nfor covering up the breaches. Timbers were thrown across; and boats\r\nfilled with earth, laid on the broken rampart, afforded a good bulwark\r\nfor the French musketeers. But the time was come when neither the skill\r\nof the engineer nor the courage of the garrison could further avail.\r\nEleven practicable breaches had been opened, and St. Rémy assured the\r\nadmiral that he could not engage to hold out four-and-twenty hours\r\nlonger.[221]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STORMING OF ST. QUENTIN.]\r\n\r\nThe duke of Savoy also saw that the time had come to bring the siege to\r\na close by a general assault. The twenty-seventh of August was the day\r\nassigned for it. On that preceding he fired three mines, which shook\r\ndown some fragments of the wall, but did less execution than was\r\nexpected. On the morning of the twenty-seventh, his whole force was\r\nunder arms. The duke divided it into as many corps as there were\r\nbreaches, placing these corps under his best and bravest officers. He\r\nproposed to direct the assault in person.\r\n\r\nColigni made his preparations also with consummate coolness. He posted a\r\nbody of troops at each of the breaches, while he and his brother\r\nDandelot took charge of the two which, still more exposed than the\r\nothers, might be considered as the post of danger. He had the\r\nsatisfaction to find, in this hour of trial, that the men, as well as\r\ntheir officers, seemed to be animated with his own heroic spirit.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to storm the place, the duke of Savoy opened a brisk\r\ncannonade, in order to clear away the barricades of timber, and other\r\ntemporary defences, which had been thrown across the breaches. The fire\r\ncontinued for several hours, and it was not till afternoon that the\r\nsignal was given for the assault. The troops rushed forward,--Spaniards,\r\nFlemings, English, and Germans,--spurred on by feelings of national\r\nrivalry. A body of eight thousand brave Englishmen had joined the\r\nstandard of Philip in the early part of the campaign;[222] and they now\r\neagerly coveted the opportunity for distinction which had been denied\r\nthem at the battle of St. Quentin, where the fortune of the day was\r\nchiefly decided by cavalry. But no troops felt so keen a spur to their\r\nachievements as the Spaniards, fighting as they were under the eye of\r\ntheir sovereign, who from a neighboring eminence was spectator of the\r\ncombat.\r\n\r\nThe obstacles were not formidable in the path of the assailants, who\r\nsoon clambered over the fragments of masonry and other rubbish which lay\r\nscattered below the ramparts, and, in the face of a steady fire of\r\nmusketry, presented themselves before the breaches. The brave men\r\nstationed to defend them were in sufficient strength to occupy the open\r\nspaces; their elevated position gave them some advantage over the\r\nassailants, and they stood to their posts with the resolution of men\r\nprepared to die rather than surrender. A fierce conflict now ensued\r\nalong the whole extent of the ramparts; and the French, sustained by a\r\ndauntless spirit, bore themselves as stoutly in the fight as if they had\r\nbeen in training for it of late, instead of being enfeebled by scanty\r\nsubsistence and excessive toil. After a severe struggle, which lasted\r\nnearly an hour, the Spaniards were driven back at all points. Not a\r\nbreach was won; and, broken and dispirited, the assailants were\r\ncompelled to retire on their former position.\r\n\r\nAfter this mortifying repulse, the duke did not give them a long time to\r\nbreathe, before he again renewed the assault. This time he directed the\r\nmain attack against a tower where the resistance had been weakest. In\r\nfact, Coligni had there placed the troops on whom he had least reliance,\r\ntrusting to the greater strength of the works. But a strong heart is\r\nworth all the defences in the world. After a sharp but short struggle,\r\nthe assailants succeeded in carrying the tower. The faint-hearted troops\r\ngave way; and the Spaniards, throwing themselves on the rampart,\r\nremained masters of one of the breaches. A footing once gained, the\r\nassailants poured impetuously into the opening, Spaniards, Germans, and\r\nEnglish streaming like a torrent along the ramparts, and attacking the\r\ndefenders on their flank. Coligni, meanwhile, and his brother Dandelot,\r\nhad rushed, with a few followers, to the spot, in the hope, if possible,\r\nto arrest the impending ruin. But they were badly supported. Overwhelmed\r\nby numbers, they were trodden down, disarmed, and made prisoners. Still\r\nthe garrison, at the remaining breaches, continued to make a desperate\r\nstand. But, with one corps pressing them on flank, and another in front,\r\nthey were speedily cut to pieces, or disabled and taken. In half an\r\nhour resistance had ceased along the ramparts. The town was in\r\npossession of the Spaniards.[223]\r\n\r\nA scene of riot and wild uproar followed, such as made the late conflict\r\nseem tame in comparison. The victorious troops spread over the town in\r\nquest of plunder, perpetrating those deeds of ruthless violence, usual,\r\neven in this enlightened age, in a city taken by storm. The wretched\r\ninhabitants fled before them; the old and the helpless, the women and\r\nchildren, taking refuge in garrets, cellars, and any other corner where\r\nthey could hide themselves from their pursuers. Nothing was to be heard\r\nbut the groans of the wounded and the dying, the cries of women and\r\nchildren,--\"so pitiful,\" says one present, \"that they would grieve any\r\nChristian heart,\"[224]--mingled, with the shouts of the victors, who,\r\nintoxicated with liquor, and loaded with booty, now madly set fire to\r\nseveral of the buildings, which soon added the dangers of conflagration\r\nto the other horrors of the scene. In a short time, the town would have\r\nbeen reduced to ashes, and the place which Philip had won at so much\r\ncost would have been lost to him by the excesses of his own soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe king had now entered the city in person. He had never been present\r\nat the storming of a place, and the dreadful spectacle which he\r\nwitnessed touched his heart. Measures were instantly taken to extinguish\r\nthe flames, and orders were issued that no one, under pain of death,\r\nshould offer any violence to the old and infirm, to the women and\r\nchildren, to the ministers of religion, to religious edifices, or, above\r\nall, to the relics of the blessed St. Quentin. Several hundred of the\r\npoor people, it is said, presented themselves before Philip, and claimed\r\nhis protection. By his command they were conducted, under a strong\r\nescort, to a place of safety.[225]\r\n\r\nIt was not possible, however, to prevent the pillage of the town. It\r\nwould have been as easy to snatch the carcass from the tiger that was\r\nrending it. The pillage of a place taken by storm was regarded as the\r\nperquisite of the soldier, on which he counted as regularly as on his\r\npay. Those who distinguished themselves most, in this ruthless work,\r\nwere the German mercenaries. Their brutal rapacity filled even their\r\nconfederates with indignation. The latter seem to have been particularly\r\ndisgusted with the unscrupulous manner in which the _schwarzreiters_\r\nappropriated not only their own share of the plunder, but that of both\r\nEnglish and Spaniards.[226]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUCCESSES OF THE SPANIARDS.]\r\n\r\nThus fell the ancient town of St. Quentin, after a defence which\r\nreflects equal honor on the courage of the garrison, and on the conduct\r\nof their commander. With its fortifications wretchedly out of repair,\r\nits supplies of arms altogether inadequate, the number of its garrison\r\nat no time exceeding a thousand, it still held out for near a month\r\nagainst a powerful army, fighting under the eyes of its sovereign, and\r\nled by one of the best captains of Europe.[227]\r\n\r\nPhilip, having taken measures to restore the fortifications of St.\r\nQuentin, placed it under the protection of a Spanish garrison, and\r\nmarched against the neighboring town of Catelet. It was a strong place,\r\nbut its defenders, unlike their valiant countrymen at St. Quentin, after\r\na brief show of resistance, capitulated on the sixth of September. This\r\nwas followed by the surrender of Ham, once renowned through Picardy for\r\nthe strength of its defences. Philip then led his victorious battalions\r\nagainst Noyon and Chaulny, which last town was sacked by the soldiers.\r\nThe French were filled with consternation, as one strong place after\r\nanother, on the frontier, fell into the hands of an enemy who seemed as\r\nif he were planting his foot permanently on their soil. That Philip did\r\nnot profit by his success to push his conquests still further, is to be\r\nattributed not to remissness on his part, but to the conduct, or rather\r\nthe composition, of his army, made up, as it was, of troops, who,\r\nselling their swords to the highest bidder, cared little for the banner\r\nunder which they fought. Drawn from different countries, the soldiers,\r\ngathered into one camp, soon showed all their national rivalries and\r\nanimosities. The English quarrelled with the Germans, and neither could\r\nbrook the insolent bearing of the Spaniards. The Germans complained that\r\ntheir arrears were not paid,--a complaint probably well founded, as,\r\nnotwithstanding his large resources, Philip, on an emergency, found the\r\ndifficulty in raising funds, which every prince in that day felt, when\r\nthere was no such thing known as a well-arranged system of taxation.\r\nTempted by the superior offers of Henry the Second, the _schwarzreiters_\r\nleft the standard of Philip in great numbers, to join that of his rival.\r\n\r\nThe English were equally discontented. They had brought from home the\r\naversion for the Spaniards which had been festering there since the\r\nqueen's marriage. The sturdy islanders were not at all pleased with\r\nserving under Philip. They were fighting, not the battles of England,\r\nthey said, but of Spain. Every new conquest was adding to the power of a\r\nmonarch far too powerful already. They had done enough, and insisted on\r\nbeing allowed to return to their own country. The king, who dreaded\r\nnothing so much as a rupture between his English and his Spanish\r\nsubjects, to which he saw the state of things rapidly tending, was fain\r\nto consent.\r\n\r\nBy this departure of the English force, and the secession of the\r\nGermans, Philip's strength was so much impaired, that he was in no\r\ncondition to make conquests, hardly to keep the field. The season was\r\nnow far advanced, for it was the end of October. Having, therefore,\r\ngarrisoned the conquered places, and put them in the best posture of\r\ndefence, he removed his camp to Brussels, and soon after put his army\r\ninto winter-quarters.[228]\r\n\r\nThus ended the first campaign of Philip the Second; the first, and, with\r\nthe exception of the following, the only campaign in which he was\r\npersonally present. It had been eminently successful. Besides the\r\nimportant places which he had gained on the frontier of Picardy, he had\r\nwon a signal victory in the field.\r\n\r\nBut the campaign was not so memorable for military results as in a moral\r\nview. It showed the nations of Europe that the Spanish sceptre had\r\npassed into the hands of a prince who was as watchful as his predecessor\r\nhad been over the interests of the state; and who, if he were not so\r\nactively ambitious as Charles the Fifth, would be as little likely to\r\nbrook any insult from his neighbors. The victory of St. Quentin,\r\noccurring at the commencement of his reign, reminded men of the victory\r\nwon at Pavia by his father, at a similar period of his career, and, like\r\nthat, furnished a brilliant augury for the future. Philip, little given\r\nto any visible expression of his feelings, testified his joy at the\r\nsuccess of his arms, by afterwards raising the magnificent pile of the\r\nEscorial, in honor of the blessed martyr St. Lawrence, on whose day the\r\nbattle was fought, and to whose interposition with Heaven he attributed\r\nthe victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nWAR WITH FRANCE.\r\n\r\nExtraordinary Efforts of France.--Calais surprised by Guise.--The French\r\ninvade Flanders.--Bloody Battle of Gravelines.--Negotiations for\r\nPeace.--Mary's Death.--Accession of Elizabeth.--Treaty of\r\nCateau-Cambresis.\r\n\r\n1557-1559.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs in France justified Philip's conclusions in respect\r\nto the loyalty of the people. No sooner did Henry the Second receive\r\ntidings of the fatal battle of St. Quentin, than he despatched couriers\r\nin all directions, summoning his chivalry to gather round his banner,\r\nand calling on the towns for aid in his extremity. The nobles and\r\ncavaliers promptly responded to the call, flocking in with their\r\nretainers; and not only the large towns, but those of inferior size,\r\ncheerfully submitted to be heavily taxed for the public service. Paris\r\nnobly set the example. She did not exhaust her zeal in processions of\r\nthe clergy, headed by the queen and the royal family, carrying with them\r\nrelics from the different churches. All the citizens capable of bearing\r\narms enrolled themselves for the defence of the capital; and large\r\nappropriations were made for strengthening Montmartre, and for defraying\r\nthe expenses of the war.[229]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CALAIS SURPRISED BY GUISE.]\r\n\r\nWith these and other resources at his command, Henry was speedily\r\nenabled to subsidize a large body of Swiss and German mercenaries. The\r\nnative troops serving abroad were ordered home. The veteran Marshal\r\nTermes came, with a large corps, from Tuscany, and the duke of Guise\r\nreturned, with the remnant of his battalions, from Rome. This popular\r\ncommander was welcomed with enthusiasm. The nation seemed to look to him\r\nas to the deliverer of the country. His late campaign in the kingdom of\r\nNaples was celebrated as if it had been a brilliant career of victory.\r\nHe was made lieutenant-general of the army, and the oldest captains were\r\nproud to take service under so renowned a chief.\r\n\r\nThe government was not slow to profit by the extraordinary resources\r\nthus placed at its disposal. Though in the depth of winter, it was\r\nresolved to undertake some enterprise that should retrieve the disasters\r\nof the late campaign, and raise the drooping spirits of the nation. The\r\nobject proposed was the recovery of Calais, that strong place, which for\r\nmore than two centuries had remained in possession of the English.\r\n\r\nThe French had ever been keenly sensible to the indignity of an enemy\r\nthus planting his foot immovably, as it were, on their soil. They had\r\nlooked to the recovery of Calais with the same feelings with which the\r\nSpanish Moslems, when driven into Africa, looked to the recovery of\r\ntheir ancient possessions in Granada. They showed how constantly this\r\nwas in their thoughts, by a common saying respecting any commander whom\r\nthey held lightly, that he was \"not a man to drive the English out of\r\nFrance.\"[230] The feelings they entertained, however, were rather those\r\nof desire than of expectation. The place was so strong, so well\r\ngarrisoned, and so accessible to the English, that it seemed\r\nimpregnable. These same circumstances, and the long possession of the\r\nplace, had inspired the English, on the other hand, with no less\r\nconfidence, as was pretty well intimated by an inscription on the bronze\r\ngates of the town,--\"When the French besiege Calais, lead and iron will\r\nswim like cork.\"[231] This confidence, as it often happens, proved their\r\nruin.\r\n\r\nThe bishop of Acqs, the French envoy to England, on returning home, a\r\nshort time before this, had passed through Calais, and gave a strange\r\nreport of the decay of the works, and the small number of the garrison,\r\nin short, of the defenceless condition of the place. Guise, however, as\r\ncautious as he was brave, was unwilling to undertake so hazardous an\r\nenterprise without more precise information. When satisfied of the fact,\r\nhe entered on the project with his characteristic ardor. The plan\r\nadopted was said to have been originally suggested by Coligni. In order\r\nto deceive the enemy, the duke sent the largest division of the army,\r\nunder Nevers, in the direction of Luxemburg. He then marched with the\r\nremainder into Picardy, as if to menace one of the places conquered by\r\nthe Spaniards. Soon afterwards the two corps united, and Guise, at the\r\nhead of his whole force, by a rapid march, presented himself before the\r\nwalls of Calais.\r\n\r\nThe town was defended by a strong citadel, and by two forts. One of\r\nthese, commanding the approach by water, the duke stormed and captured\r\non the second of January, 1558. The other, which overlooked the land, he\r\ncarried on the following day. Possessed of these two forts, he felt\r\nsecure from any annoyance by the enemy, either by land or by water. He\r\nthen turned his powerful battering-train against the citadel, keeping up\r\na furious cannonade by day and by night. On the fifth, as soon as a\r\nbreach was opened, the victorious troops poured in, and, overpowering\r\nthe garrison, planted the French colors on the walls. The earl of\r\nWentworth, who commanded in Calais, unable, with his scanty garrison, to\r\nmaintain the place now that the defences were in the hands of the enemy,\r\ncapitulated on the eighth. The fall of Calais was succeeded by that of\r\nGuisnes and of Hames. Thus, in a few days the English were stripped of\r\nevery rood of the territory which they had held in France since the time\r\nof Edward the Third.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Calais caused the deepest sensation on both sides of the\r\nChannel. The English, astounded by the event, loudly inveighed against\r\nthe treachery of the commander. They should rather have blamed the\r\ntreachery of their own government, who had so grossly neglected to\r\nprovide for the defence of the place. Philip, suspecting the designs of\r\nthe French, had intimated his suspicions to the English government, and\r\nhad offered to strengthen the garrison by a reinforcement of his own\r\ntroops. But his allies, perhaps distrusting his motives, despised his\r\ncounsel, or at least failed to profit by it.[232] After the place was\r\ntaken, he made another offer to send a strong force to recover it,\r\nprovided the English would support him with a sufficient fleet. This\r\nalso, perhaps from the same feeling of distrust, though on the plea of\r\ninability to meet the expense, was declined, and the opportunity for the\r\nrecovery of Calais was lost for ever.[233]\r\n\r\nYet, in truth, it was no great loss to the nation. Like more than one,\r\nprobably, of the colonial possessions of England at the present day,\r\nCalais cost every year more than it was worth. Its chief value was the\r\nfacility it afforded for the invasion of France. Yet such a facility for\r\nwar with their neighbors, always too popular with the English before the\r\ntime of Philip the Second, was of questionable value. The real injury\r\nfrom the loss of Calais was the wound which it inflicted on the national\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\nThe exultation of the French was boundless. It could not well have been\r\ngreater, if the duke of Guise had crossed the Channel and taken London\r\nitself. The brilliant and rapid manner in which the exploit had been\r\nperformed, the gallantry with which the young general had exposed his\r\nown person in the assault, the generosity with which he had divided his\r\nshare of the booty among the soldiers, all struck the lively imagination\r\nof the French; and he became more than ever the idol of the people.\r\n\r\nYet, during the remainder of the campaign, his arms were not crowned\r\nwith such distinguished success. In May he marched against the strong\r\ntown of Thionville, in Luxemburg. After a siege of twenty days, the\r\nplace surrendered. Having taken one or two other towns of less\r\nimportance, the French army wasted nearly three weeks in a state of\r\ninaction, unless, indeed, we take into account the activity caused by\r\nintestine troubles of the army itself. It is difficult to criticize\r\nfairly the conduct of a commander of that age, when his levies were made\r\nup so largely of foreign mercenaries, who felt so little attachment to\r\nthe service in which they were engaged, that they were ready to quarrel\r\nwith it on the slightest occasion. Among these the German\r\n_schwarzreiters_ were the most conspicuous, manifesting too often a\r\ndegree of insolence and insubordination that made them hardly less\r\ndangerous as friends than as enemies. The importance they attached to\r\ntheir own services made them exorbitant in their demands of pay. When\r\nthis, as was too frequently the case, was in arrears, they took the\r\nmatter into their own hands, by pillaging the friendly country in which\r\nthey were quartered, or by breaking out into open mutiny. A German\r\nbaron, on one occasion, went so far as to level his pistol at the head\r\nof the duke of Guise. So widely did this mutinous spirit extend, that\r\nit was only by singular coolness and address that this popular chieftain\r\ncould bring these adventurers into anything like subjection to his\r\nauthority. As it was, the loss of time caused by these troubles was\r\nattended with most disastrous consequences.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FRENCH INVADE FLANDERS.]\r\n\r\nThe duke had left Calais garrisoned by a strong force, under Marshal\r\nTermes. He had since ordered that veteran to take command of a body of\r\nfifteen hundred horse and five thousand foot, drawn partly from the\r\ngarrison itself, and to march into West Flanders. Guise proposed to join\r\nhim there with his own troops, when they would furnish such occupation\r\nto the Spaniards as would effectually prevent them from a second\r\ninvasion of Picardy.\r\n\r\nThe plan was well designed, and the marshal faithfully executed his part\r\nof it. Taking the road by St. Omer, he entered Flanders in the\r\nneighborhood of Dunkirk, laid siege to that flourishing town, stormed\r\nand gave it up to pillage. He then penetrated as far as Nieuport, when\r\nthe fatigue and the great heat of the weather brought on an attack of\r\ngout, which entirely disabled him. The officer on whom the command\r\ndevolved allowed the men to spread themselves over the country, where\r\nthey perpetrated such acts of rapacity and violence as were not\r\nsanctioned even by the code of that unscrupulous age. The wretched\r\ninhabitants, driven from their homes, called loudly on Count Egmont,\r\ntheir governor, to protect them. The duke of Savoy lay with his army, at\r\nthis time, at Maubeuge, in the province of Namur; but he sent orders to\r\nEgmont to muster such forces as he could raise in the neighboring\r\ncountry, and to intercept the retreat of the French, until the duke\r\ncould come to his support and chastise the enemy.\r\n\r\nEgmont, indignant at the wrongs of his countrymen, and burning with the\r\ndesire of revenge, showed the greatest alacrity in obeying these orders.\r\nVolunteers came in from all sides, and he soon found himself at the head\r\nof an army consisting of ten or twelve thousand foot and two thousand\r\nhorse. With these he crossed the borders at once, and sent forward a\r\ndetachment to occupy the great road by which De Termes had penetrated\r\ninto Flanders.\r\n\r\nThe French commander, advised too late of these movements, saw that it\r\nwas necessary to abandon at once his present quarters, and secure, if\r\npossible, his retreat. Guise was at a distance, occupied with the\r\ntroubles of his own camp. The Flemings had possession of the route by\r\nwhich the marshal had entered the country. One other lay open to him\r\nalong the sea-shore, in the neighborhood of Gravelines, where the Aa\r\npours its waters into the ocean. By taking advantage of the ebb, the\r\nriver might be forded, and a direct road to Calais would be presented.\r\n\r\nTermes saw that no time was to be lost. He caused himself to be removed\r\nfrom his sick-bed to a litter, and began his retreat at once. On leaving\r\nDunkirk, he fired the town, where the houses were all that remained to\r\nthe wretched inhabitants of their property. His march was impeded by his\r\nartillery, by his baggage, and especially by the booty which he was\r\nconveying back from the plundered provinces. He however succeeded in\r\ncrossing the Aa at low water, and gained the sands on the opposite side.\r\nBut the enemy was there before him.[234]\r\n\r\nEgmont, on getting tidings of the marshal's movements, had crossed the\r\nriver higher up, where the stream was narrower. Disencumbering himself\r\nof artillery, and even of baggage, in order to move the lighter, he made\r\na rapid march to the sea-side, and reached it in time to intercept the\r\nenemy. There was no choice left for Termes but to fight his way through\r\nthe Spaniards or surrender.\r\n\r\nIll as he was, the marshal mounted his horse, and addressed a few words\r\nto his troops. Pointing in the direction of the blazing ruins of\r\nDunkirk, he told them that they could not return there. Then turning\r\ntowards Calais, \"There is your home,\" he said, \"and you must beat the\r\nenemy before you can gain it.\" He determined, however, not to begin the\r\naction, but to secure his position as strongly as he could, and wait the\r\nassault of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nHe placed his infantry in the centre, and flanked it on either side by\r\nhis cavalry. In the front he established his artillery, consisting of\r\nsix or seven falconets,--field-pieces of smaller size. He threw a\r\nconsiderable body of Gascon pikemen in the rear, to act as a reserve\r\nwherever their presence should be required. The river Aa, which flowed\r\nbehind his troops, formed also a good protection in that quarter. His\r\nleft wing he covered by a barricade made of the baggage and artillery\r\nwagons. His right, which rested on the ocean, seemed secure from any\r\nannoyance on that side.\r\n\r\nCount Egmont, seeing the French thus preparing to give battle, quickly\r\nmade his own dispositions. He formed his cavalry into three divisions.\r\nThe centre he proposed to lead in person. It was made up chiefly of the\r\nheavy men-at-arms and some Flemish horse. On the right he placed his\r\nlight cavalry, and on the left wing rode the Spanish. His infantry he\r\ndrew up in such a manner as to support the several divisions of horse.\r\nHaving completed his arrangements, he gave orders to the centre and the\r\nright wing to charge, and rode at full gallop against the enemy.\r\n\r\nThough somewhat annoyed by the heavy guns in their advance, the\r\nbattalions came on in good order, and fell with such fury on the French\r\nleft and centre, that horse and foot were borne down by the violence of\r\nthe shock. But the French gentlemen who formed the cavalry were of the\r\nsame high mettle as those who fought at St. Quentin. Though borne down\r\nfor a moment, they were not overpowered; and, after a desperate\r\nstruggle, they succeeded in rallying and in driving back the assailants.\r\nEgmont returned to the charge, but was forced back with greater loss\r\nthan before. The French, following up their advantage, compelled the\r\nassailants to retreat on their own lines. The guns, at the same time,\r\nopening on the exposed flank of the retreating troopers, did them\r\nconsiderable mischief. Egmont's horse was killed under him, and he had\r\nnearly been run over by his own followers. In the mean while, the Gascon\r\nreserve, armed with their long spears, pushed on to the support of the\r\ncavalry, and filled the air with their shouts of \"Victory!\"[235]\r\n\r\nThe field seemed to be already lost; when the left wing of Spanish\r\nhorse, which had not yet come into action, seeing the disorderly state\r\nof the French, as they were pressing on, charged them briskly on the\r\nflank. This had the effect to check the tide of pursuit, and give the\r\nfugitives time to rally. Egmont, meanwhile, was mounted on a fresh\r\nhorse, and, throwing himself into the midst of his followers, endeavored\r\nto reanimate their courage and reform their disordered ranks. Then,\r\ncheering them on by his voice and example, he cried out, \"We are\r\nconquerors! Those who love glory and their fatherland, follow me!\"[236]\r\nand spurred furiously against the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BATTLE OF GRAVELINES.]\r\n\r\nThe French, hard pressed both on front and on flank, fell back in their\r\nturn, and continued to retreat till they had gained their former\r\nposition. At the same time, the _lanzknechts_ in Egmont's service,\r\nmarched up, in defiance of the fire of the artillery, and got possession\r\nof the guns, running the men who had charge of them through with their\r\nlances.[237] The fight now became general; and, as the combatants were\r\nbrought into close quarters, they fought as men fight where numbers are\r\nnearly balanced, and each one seems to feel that his own arm may turn\r\nthe scale of victory. The result was brought about by an event which\r\nneither party could control, and neither have foreseen.\r\n\r\nAn English squadron of ten or twelve vessels lay at some distance, but\r\nout of sight of the combatants. Attracted by the noise of the firing,\r\nits commander drew near the scene of action, and, ranging along shore,\r\nopened his fire on the right wing of the French, nearest the sea.[238]\r\nThe shot, probably, from the distance of the ships, did no great\r\nexecution, and is even said to have killed some of the Spaniards. But it\r\nspread a panic among the French, as they found themselves assailed by a\r\nnew enemy, who seemed to have risen from the depths of the ocean. In\r\ntheir eagerness to extricate themselves from the fire, the cavalry on\r\nthe right threw themselves on the centre, trampling down their own\r\ncomrades, until all discipline was lost, and horse and foot became\r\nmingled together in wild disorder. Egmont profited by the opportunity to\r\nrenew his charge; and at length, completely broken and dispirited, the\r\nenemy gave way in all directions. The stout body of Gascons who formed\r\nthe reserve alone held their ground for a time, until, vigorously\r\ncharged by the phalanx of Spanish spearmen, they broke, and were\r\nscattered like the rest.\r\n\r\nThe rout was now general, and the victorious cavalry rode over the\r\nfield, trampling and cutting down the fugitives on all sides. Many who\r\ndid not fall under their swords perished in the waters of the Aa, now\r\nswollen by the rising tide. Others were drowned in the ocean. No less\r\nthan fifteen hundred of those who escaped from the field are said to\r\nhave been killed by the peasantry, who occupied the passes, and thus\r\ntook bloody revenge for the injuries inflicted on their country.[239]\r\nTwo thousand French are stated to have fallen on the field, and not more\r\nthan five hundred Spaniards, or rather Flemings, who composed the bulk\r\nof the army. The loss fell most severely on the French cavalry; severely\r\nindeed, if, according to some accounts, not very credible, they were cut\r\nto pieces almost to a man.[240] The number of prisoners was three\r\nthousand. Among them was Marshal Termes himself, who had been disabled\r\nby a wound in the head. All the baggage, the ammunition, and the rich\r\nspoil gleaned by the foray into Flanders, became the prize of the\r\nvictors.--Although not so important for the amount of forces engaged,\r\nthe victory of Gravelines was as complete as that of St. Quentin.[241]\r\n\r\nYet the French, who had a powerful army on foot, were in better\r\ncondition to meet their reverses than on that day. The duke of Guise, on\r\nreceiving the tidings, instantly marched with his whole force, and\r\nposted himself strongly behind the Somme, in order to cover Picardy from\r\ninvasion. The duke of Savoy, uniting his forces with those of Count\r\nEgmont, took up a position along the line of the Authie, and made\r\ndemonstrations of laying siege to Dourlens. The French and Spanish\r\nmonarchs both took the field. So well appointed and large a force as\r\nthat led by Henry had not been seen in France for many a year; yet that\r\nmonarch might justly be mortified by the reflection that the greater\r\npart of this force was made up of foreign mercenaries, amounting, it is\r\nsaid, to forty thousand. Philip was in equal strength, and the length of\r\nthe war had enabled him to assemble his best captains around him. Among\r\nthem was Alva, whose cautious councils might serve to temper the bolder\r\nenterprise of the duke of Savoy.\r\n\r\nA level ground, four leagues in breadth, lay between the armies.\r\nSkirmishes took place occasionally between the light troops on either\r\nside, and a general engagement might be brought on at any moment. All\r\neyes were turned to the battle-field, where the two greatest princes of\r\nEurope might so soon contend for mastery with each other. Had the\r\nfathers of these princes, Charles the Fifth and Francis the First, been\r\nin the field, such very probably would have been the issue. But Philip\r\nwas not disposed to risk the certain advantages he had already gained by\r\na final appeal to arms. And Henry was still less inclined to peril\r\nall--his capital, perhaps his crown--on the hazard of a single cast.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NEGOTIATIONS FOR PEACE.]\r\n\r\nThere were many circumstances which tended to make both monarchs prefer\r\na more peaceful arbitrament of their quarrel, and to disgust them with\r\nthe war. Among these was the ruinous state of their finances.[242] When\r\nRuy Gomez de Silva, as has been already stated, was sent to Spain by\r\nPhilip, he was commanded to avail himself of every expedient that could\r\nbe devised to raise money. Offices were put up for sale to the highest\r\nbidder. The public revenues were mortgaged. Large sums were obtained\r\nfrom merchants at exorbitant rates of interest. Forced loans were\r\nexacted from individuals, especially from such as were known to have\r\nreceived large returns by the late arrivals from the New World. Three\r\nhundred thousand ducats were raised on the security of the coming fair\r\nat Villalon. The Regent Joanna was persuaded to sell her yearly pension,\r\nassigned her on the _alcavala_, for a downright sum to meet the\r\nexigencies of the state. Goods were obtained from the king of Portugal,\r\nin order to be sent to Flanders for the profit to be raised on the\r\nsale.[243] Such were the wretched devices by which Philip, who inherited\r\nthis policy of temporizing expedients from his father, endeavored to\r\nreplenish his exhausted treasury. Besides the sums drawn from Castile,\r\nthe king obtained also no less than a million and a half of ducats, as\r\nan extraordinary grant from the states of the Netherlands.[244] Yet\r\nthese sums, large as they were, were soon absorbed by the expense of\r\nkeeping armies on foot in France and in Italy. Philip's correspondence\r\nwith his ministers teems with representations of the low state of his\r\nfinances, of the arrears due to his troops, and the necessity of\r\nimmediate supplies to save him from bankruptcy. The prospects the\r\nministers hold out to him in return are anything but encouraging.[245]\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance which made both princes desire the termination of\r\nthe war was the disturbed state of their own kingdoms. The Protestant\r\nheresy had already begun to rear its formidable crest in the\r\nNetherlands; and the Huguenots were beginning to claim the notice of the\r\nFrench government. Henry the Second, who was penetrated, as much as\r\nPhilip himself, with the spirit of the Inquisition, longed for leisure\r\nto crush the heretical doctrines in the bud. In this pious purpose he\r\nwas encouraged by Paul the Fourth, who, now that he was himself\r\nrestrained from levying war against his neighbors, seemed resolved that\r\nno one else should claim that indulgence. He sent legates to both Henry\r\nand Philip, conjuring them, instead of warring with each other, to turn\r\ntheir arms against the heretics in their dominions, who were sapping the\r\nfoundations of the Church.[246]\r\n\r\nThe pacific disposition of the two monarchs was, moreover, fostered by\r\nthe French prisoners, and especially by Montmorency, whose authority had\r\nbeen such at court, that Charles the Fifth declared \"his capture was\r\nmore important than would have been that of the king himself.\"[247] The\r\nold constable was most anxious to return to his own country, where he\r\nsaw with uneasiness the ascendancy which his absence and the\r\nprolongation of the war were giving to his rival, Guise, in the royal\r\ncounsels. Through him negotiations were opened with the French court,\r\nuntil, Henry the Second thinking, with good reason, that these\r\nnegotiations would be better conducted by a regular congress than by\r\nprisoners in the custody of his enemies, commissioners were appointed on\r\nboth sides, to arrange the terms of accommodation.[248] Montmorency and\r\nhis fellow-captive, Marshal St. André, were included in the commission.\r\nBut the person of most importance in it, on the part of France, was the\r\ncardinal of Lorraine, brother of the duke of Guise, a man of a subtle,\r\nintriguing temper, and one who, like the rest of his family,\r\nnotwithstanding his pacific demonstrations, may be said to have\r\nrepresented the war party in France[249]\r\n\r\nOn the part of Spain the agents selected were the men most conspicuous\r\nfor talent and authority in the kingdom; the names of some of whom,\r\nwhether for good or for evil report, remain immortal on the page of\r\nhistory. Among these were the duke of Alva and his great antagonist,--as\r\nhe became afterwards in the Netherlands,--William of Orange. But the\r\nprincipal person in the commission, the man who in fact directed it, was\r\nAnthony Perrenot, bishop of Arras, better known by his later title of\r\nCardinal Granvelle. He was son of the celebrated chancellor of that name\r\nunder Charles the Fifth, by whom he was early trained, not so much to\r\nthe duties of the ecclesiastical profession as of public life. He\r\nprofited so well by the instruction, that, in the emperor's time, he\r\nsucceeded his father in the royal confidence, and surpassed him in his\r\ntalent for affairs. His accommodating temper combined with his zeal for\r\nthe interests of Philip to recommend Granvelle to the favor of that\r\nmonarch; and his insinuating address and knowledge of character well\r\nqualified him for conducting a negotiation where there were so many\r\njarring feelings to be brought into concord, so many hostile and\r\nperplexing interests to be reconciled.\r\n\r\nAs a suspension of hostilities was agreed on during the continuance of\r\nthe negotiations, it was decided to remove the armies from the\r\nneighborhood of each other, where a single spark might at any time lead\r\nto a general explosion. A still stronger earnest was given of their\r\npacific intentions, by both the monarchs disbanding part of their\r\nforeign mercenaries, whose services were purchased at a ruinous cost,\r\nthat made one of the great evils of the war.\r\n\r\nThe congress met on the fifteenth of October, 1558, at the abbey of\r\nCercamps, near Cambray. Between parties so well disposed, it might be\r\nthought that some general terms of accommodation would soon be settled.\r\nBut the war, which ran back pretty far into Charles the Fifth's time,\r\nhad continued so long, that many territories had changed masters during\r\nthe contest, and it was not easy to adjust the respective claims to\r\nthem. The duke of Savoy's dominions, for example, had passed into the\r\nhands of Henry the Second, who, moreover, asserted an hereditary right\r\nto them through his grandmother. Yet it was not possible for Philip to\r\nabandon his ally, the man whom he had placed at the head of his armies.\r\nBut the greatest obstacle was Calais. \"If we return without the recovery\r\nof Calais,\" said the English envoys, who also took part in this\r\ncongress, \"we shall be stoned to death by the people.\"[250]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARY'S DEATH.]\r\n\r\nPhilip supported the claim of England; and yet it was evident that\r\nFrance would never relinquish a post so important to herself, which,\r\nafter so many years of hope deferred, had at last come again into her\r\npossession. While engaged in the almost hopeless task of adjusting these\r\ndifferences, an event occurred which suspended the negotiations for a\r\ntime, and exercised an important influence on the affairs of Europe.\r\nThis was the death of one of the parties to the war, Queen Mary of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nMary's health had been fast declining of late, under the pressure of\r\nboth mental and bodily disease. The loss of Calais bore heavily on her\r\nspirits, as she thought of the reproach it would bring on her reign, and\r\nthe increased unpopularity it would draw upon herself. \"When I die,\" she\r\nsaid, in the strong language since made familiar to Englishmen by the\r\nsimilar expression of their great admiral, \"Calais will be found written\r\non my heart.\"[251]\r\n\r\nPhilip, who was not fully apprised of the queen's low condition, early\r\nin November sent the count, afterwards duke, of Feria as his envoy to\r\nLondon, with letters for Mary. This nobleman, who had married one of the\r\nqueen's maids of honor, stood high in the favor of his master. With\r\ncourtly manners, and a magnificent way of living, he combined a\r\nshrewdness and solidity of judgment, that eminently fitted him for his\r\npresent mission. The queen received with great joy the letters which he\r\nbrought her, though too ill to read them. Feria, seeing the low state of\r\nMary's health, was earnest with the council to secure the succession for\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\nHe had the honor of supping with the princess at her residence in\r\nHatfield, about eighteen miles from London. The Spaniard enlarged, in\r\nthe course of conversation, on the good-will of his master to Elizabeth,\r\nas shown in the friendly offices he had rendered her during her\r\nimprisonment, and his desire to have her succeed to the crown. The envoy\r\ndid not add that this desire was prompted not so much by the king's\r\nconcern for the interests of Elizabeth as by his jealousy of the French,\r\nwho seemed willing to countenance the pretensions of Mary Stuart, the\r\nwife of the dauphin, to the English throne.[252] The princess\r\nacknowledged the protection she had received from Philip in her\r\ntroubles. \"But for her present prospects,\" she said, \"she was indebted\r\nneither to the king nor to the English lords, however much these latter\r\nmight vaunt their fidelity. It was to the people that she owed them, and\r\non the people she relied.\"[253] This answer of Elizabeth furnishes the\r\nkey to her success.\r\n\r\nThe penetrating eye of the envoy soon perceived that the English\r\nprincess was under evil influences. The persons most in her confidence,\r\nhe wrote, were understood to have a decided leaning to the Lutheran\r\nheresy, and he augured most unfavorably for the future prospects of the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth of November, 1558, after a brief, but most disastrous\r\nreign, Queen Mary died. Her fate had been a hard one. Unimpeachable in\r\nher private life, and, however misguided, with deeply-seated religious\r\nprinciples, she has yet left a name held in more general execration than\r\nany other on the roll of English sovereigns. One obvious way of\r\naccounting for this, doubtless, is by the spirit of persecution which\r\nhung like a dark cloud over her reign. And this not merely on account of\r\nthe persecution; for that was common with the line of Tudor; but because\r\nit was directed against the professors of a religion which came to be\r\nthe established religion of the country. Thus the blood of the martyr\r\nbecame the seed of a great and powerful church, ready through all after\r\ntime to bear testimony to the ruthless violence of its oppressor.\r\n\r\nThere was still another cause of Mary's unpopularity. The daughter of\r\nKatharine of Aragon could not fail to be nurtured in a reverence for the\r\nillustrious line from which she was descended. The education begun in\r\nthe cradle was continued in later years. When the young princess was\r\nbetrothed to her cousin, Charles the Fifth, it was stipulated that she\r\nshould be made acquainted with the language and the institutions of\r\nCastile, and should even wear the costume of the country. \"And who,\"\r\nexclaimed Henry the Eighth, \"is so well fitted to instruct her in all\r\nthis as the queen, her mother?\" Even after the match with her imperial\r\nsuitor was broken off by his marriage with the Portuguese infanta,\r\nCharles still continued to take a lively interest in the fortunes of his\r\nyoung kinswoman; while she, in her turn, naturally looked to the\r\nemperor, as her nearest relative, for counsel and support. Thus drawn\r\ntowards Spain by the ties of kindred, by sympathy, and by interest, Mary\r\nbecame in truth more of a Spanish than an English woman; and when all\r\nthis was completed by the odious Spanish match, and she gave her hand to\r\nPhilip the Second, the last tie seemed to be severed which had bound her\r\nto her native land. Thenceforth she remained an alien in the midst of\r\nher own subjects.--Very different was the fate of her sister and\r\nsuccessor, Elizabeth, who ruled over her people like a true-hearted\r\nEnglish queen, under no influence, and with no interests distinct from\r\ntheirs. She was requited for it by the most loyal devotion on their\r\npart; while round her throne have gathered those patriotic recollections\r\nwhich, in spite of her many errors, still render her name dear to\r\nEnglishmen.\r\n\r\nOn the death of her sister, Elizabeth, without opposition, ascended the\r\nthrone of her ancestors. It may not be displeasing to the reader to see\r\nthe portrait of her sketched by the Venetian minister at this period, or\r\nrather two years earlier, when she was twenty-three years of age. \"The\r\nprincess,\" he says, \"is as beautiful in mind as she is in body; though\r\nher countenance is rather pleasing from its expression, than\r\nbeautiful.[254] She is large and well-made; her complexion clear, and of\r\nan olive tint; her eyes are fine, and her hands, on which she prides\r\nherself, small and delicate. She has an excellent genius, with much\r\naddress and self-command, as was abundantly shown in the severe trials\r\nto which she was exposed in the earlier part of her life. In her temper\r\nshe is haughty and imperious, qualities inherited from her father, King\r\nHenry the Eighth, who, from her resemblance to himself, is said to have\r\nregarded her with peculiar fondness.\"[255]--He had, it must be owned, an\r\nuncommon way of showing it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ACCESSION OF ELIZABETH.]\r\n\r\nOne of the first acts of Elizabeth was to write an elegant Latin epistle\r\nto Philip, in which she acquainted him with her accession to the crown,\r\nand expressed the hope that they should continue to maintain \"the same\r\nfriendly relations as their ancestors had done, and, if possible, more\r\nfriendly.\"\r\n\r\nPhilip received the tidings of his wife's death at Brussels, where her\r\nobsequies were celebrated, with great solemnity, on the same day with\r\nher funeral in London. All outward show of respect was paid to her\r\nmemory. But it is doing no injustice to Philip to suppose that his heart\r\nwas not very deeply touched by the loss of a wife so many years older\r\nthan himself, whose temper had been soured, and whose personal\r\nattractions, such as they were, had long since faded under the pressure\r\nof disease. Still, it was not without feelings of deep regret that the\r\nambitious monarch saw the sceptre of England--barren though it had\r\nproved to him--thus suddenly snatched from his grasp.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that Philip, during his residence in the country,\r\nhad occasion more than once to interpose his good offices in behalf of\r\nElizabeth. It was perhaps the friendly relation in which he thus stood\r\nto her, quite as much as her personal qualities, that excited in the\r\nking a degree of interest which seems to have provoked something like\r\njealousy in the bosom of his queen.[256] However this may be, motives of\r\na very different character from those founded on sentiment now\r\ndetermined him to retain, if possible, his hold on England, by\r\ntransferring to Elizabeth the connection which had subsisted with Mary.\r\n\r\nA month had not elapsed since Mary's remains were laid in Westminster\r\nAbbey, when the royal widower made direct offers, through his\r\nambassador, Feria, for the hand of her successor. Yet his ardor did not\r\nprecipitate him into any unqualified declaration of his passion; on the\r\ncontrary, his proposals were limited by some very prudent conditions.\r\n\r\nIt was to be understood that Elizabeth must be a Roman Catholic, and, if\r\nnot one already, must repudiate her errors and become one. She was to\r\nobtain a dispensation from the pope for the marriage. Philip was to be\r\nallowed to visit Spain, whenever he deemed it necessary for the\r\ninterests of that kingdom;--a provision which seems to show that Mary's\r\nover-fondness, or her jealousy, must have occasioned him some\r\ninconvenience on that score. It was further to be stipulated, that the\r\nissue of the marriage should not, as was agreed in the contract with\r\nMary, inherit the Netherlands, which were to pass to his son Don Carlos,\r\nthe prince of Asturias.\r\n\r\nFeria was directed to make these proposals by word of mouth, not in\r\nwriting, \"although,\" adds his considerate master, \"it is no disgrace for\r\na man to have his proposals rejected, when they are founded, not on\r\nworldly considerations, but on zeal for his Maker and the interests of\r\nreligion.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth received the offer of Philip's hand, qualified as it was, in\r\nthe most gracious manner. She told the ambassador, indeed, that, \"in a\r\nmatter of this kind, she could take no step without consulting her\r\nparliament. But his master might rest assured, that, should she be\r\ninduced to marry, there was no man she should prefer to him.\"[257]\r\nPhilip seems to have been contented with the encouragement thus given,\r\nand shortly after he addressed Elizabeth a letter, written with his own\r\nhand, in which he endeavored to impress on her how much he had at heart\r\nthe successes of his ambassador's mission.\r\n\r\nThe course of events in England, however, soon showed that such success\r\nwas not to be relied on, and that Feria's prognostics in regard to the\r\npolicy of Elizabeth were well founded. Parliament soon entered on the\r\nmeasures which ended in the subversion of the Roman Catholic, and the\r\nrestoration of the Reformed religion. And it was very evident that these\r\nmeasures, if not originally dictated by the queen, must at least have\r\nreceived her sanction.\r\n\r\nPhilip, in consequence, took counsel with two of his ministers, on whom\r\nhe most relied, as to the expediency of addressing Elizabeth on the\r\nsubject, and telling her plainly, that, unless she openly disavowed the\r\nproceedings of parliament, the marriage could not take place.[258] Her\r\nvanity should be soothed by the expressions of his regret at being\r\nobliged to relinquish the hopes of her hand. But, as her lover modestly\r\nremarked, after this candid statement of all the consequences before\r\nher, whatever the result might be, she would have no one to blame but\r\nherself.[259] His sage advisers, probably not often called to deliberate\r\non questions of this delicate nature, entirely concurred in opinion with\r\ntheir master. In any event, they regarded it as impossible that he\r\nshould wed a Protestant.\r\n\r\nWhat effect this frank remonstrance had on the queen we are not told.\r\nCertain it is, Philip's suit no longer sped so favorably as before.\r\nElizabeth, throwing off all disguise, plainly told Feria, when pressed\r\non the matter, that she felt great scruples as to seeking a dispensation\r\nfrom the pope;[260] and soon after she openly declared in parliament,\r\nwhat she was in the habit of repeating so often, that she had no other\r\npurpose but to live and die a maid.[261]--It can hardly be supposed that\r\nElizabeth entertained serious thoughts, at any time, of marrying Philip.\r\nIf she encouraged his addresses, it was only until she felt herself so\r\nsecurely seated on the throne, that she was independent of the ill-will\r\nshe would incur by their rejection. It was a game in which the heart,\r\nprobably, formed no part of the stake on either side. In this game, it\r\nmust be confessed, the English queen showed herself the better player of\r\nthe two.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TREATY OF CATEAU-CAMBRESIS.]\r\n\r\nPhilip bore his disappointment with great equanimity. He expressed his\r\nregret to Elizabeth that she should have decided in a way so contrary to\r\nwhat the public interests seemed to demand. But since it appeared to her\r\notherwise, he should acquiesce, and only hoped that the same end might\r\nbe attained by the continuance of their friendship.[262] With all this\r\nphilosophy, we may well believe that, with a character like that of\r\nPhilip, some bitterness must have remained in the heart; and that, very\r\nprobably, feelings of a personal nature mingled with those of a\r\npolitical in the long hostilities which he afterwards carried on with\r\nthe English queen.\r\n\r\nIn the month of February, the conferences for the treaty of peace had\r\nbeen resumed, and the place of meeting changed from the abbey of\r\nCercamps to Cateau-Cambresis. The negotiations were urged forward with\r\ngreater earnestness than before, as both the monarchs were more sorely\r\npressed by their necessities. Philip, in particular, was so largely in\r\narrears to his army, that he frankly told his ministers \"he was on the\r\nbrink of ruin, from which nothing but a peace could save him.\"[263] It\r\nmight be supposed that, in this state of things, he would be placed in a\r\ndisadvantageous attitude for arranging terms with his adversary. But\r\nPhilip and his ministers put the best face possible on their affairs,\r\naffecting a confidence in their resources, before their allies as well\r\nas their enemies, which they were far from feeling; like some\r\nhalf-famished garrison, which makes a brave show of its scanty stock of\r\nsupplies, in order to win better terms from the besiegers.[264]\r\n\r\nAll the difficulties were at length cleared away, except the vexed\r\nquestion of Calais. The English queen, it was currently said in the\r\ncamp, would cut off the head of any minister who abandoned it. Mary, the\r\nyoung queen of Scots, had just been married to the French dauphin,\r\nafterwards Francis the Second. It was proposed that the eldest daughter\r\nborn of this union should be united to the eldest son of Elizabeth, and\r\nbring with her Calais as a dowry. In this way, the place would be\r\nrestored to England without dishonor to France.[265] Such were the wild\r\nexpedients to which the parties resorted in the hope of extricating\r\nthemselves from their embarrassment!\r\n\r\nAt length, seeing the absolute necessity of bringing the matter to an\r\nissue, Philip ordered the Spanish plenipotentiaries to write his final\r\ninstructions to Feria, his minister in London. The envoy was authorized\r\nto say, that, although England had lost Calais through her own\r\nnegligence, yet Philip would stand faithfully by her for the recovery of\r\nit. But, on the other hand, she must be prepared to support him with her\r\nwhole strength by land and by sea, and that not for a single campaign,\r\nbut for the war so long as it lasted. The government should ponder well\r\nwhether the prize would be worth the cost. Feria must bring the matter\r\nhome to the queen, and lead her, if possible, to the desired conclusion;\r\nbut so that she might appear to come to it by her own suggestion rather\r\nthan by his. The responsibility must be left with her.[266] The letter\r\nof the plenipotentiaries, which is a very long one, is a model in its\r\nway, and shows that, in some particulars, the science of diplomacy has\r\ngained little since the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nElizabeth needed no argument to make her weary of a war which hung like\r\na dark cloud on the morning of her reign. Her disquietude had been\r\nincreased by the fact of Scotland having become a party to the war; and\r\nhostilities, with little credit to that country, had broken out along\r\nthe borders. Her own kingdom was in no condition to allow her to make\r\nthe extraordinary efforts demanded by Philip. Yet it was plain if she\r\ndid not make them, or consent to come into the treaty, she must be left\r\nto carry on the war by herself. Under these circumstances, the English\r\ngovernment at last consented to an arrangement, which, if it did not\r\nsave Calais, so far saved appearances that it might satisfy the nation.\r\nIt was agreed that Calais should be restored at the end of eight years.\r\nIf France failed to do this, she was to pay five hundred thousand crowns\r\nto England, whose claims to Calais would not, however, be affected by\r\nsuch a payment. Should either of the parties, or their subjects, during\r\nthat period, do anything in contravention of this treaty, or in\r\nviolation of the peace between the two countries, the offending party\r\nshould forfeit all claim to the disputed territory.[267] It was not very\r\nprobable that eight years would elapse without affording some plausible\r\npretext to France, under such a provision, for keeping her hold on\r\nCalais.\r\n\r\nThe treaty with England was signed on the second of April, 1559. On the\r\nday following was signed that between France and Spain. By the\r\nprovisions of this treaty, the allies of Philip, Savoy, Mantua, Genoa,\r\nwere reinstated in the possession of the territories of which they had\r\nbeen stripped in the first years of the war. Four or five places of\r\nimportance in Savoy were alone reserved, to be held as guaranties by the\r\nFrench king, until his claim to the inheritance of that kingdom was\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nThe conquests made by Philip in Picardy were to be exchanged for those\r\ngained by the French in Italy and the Netherlands. The exchange was\r\ngreatly for the benefit of Philip. In the time of Charles the Fifth, the\r\nSpanish arms had experienced some severe reverses, and the king now\r\nreceived more than two hundred towns in return for the five places he\r\nheld in Picardy.[268]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TREATY OF CATEAU-CAMBRESIS.]\r\n\r\nTerms so disadvantageous to France roused the indignation of the duke of\r\nGuise, who told Henry plainly, that a stroke of his pen would cost the\r\ncountry more than thirty years of war. \"Give me the poorest of the\r\nplaces you are to surrender,\" said he, \"and I will undertake to hold it\r\nagainst all the armies of Spain!\"[269] But Henry sighed for peace, and\r\nfor the return of his friend, the constable. He affected much deference\r\nto the opinions of the duke. But he wrote to Montmorency that the Guises\r\nwere at their old tricks,[270]--and he ratified the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe day on which the plenipotentiaries of the three great powers had\r\ncompleted their work, they went in solemn procession to the church, and\r\nreturned thanks to the Almighty for the happy consummation of their\r\nlabors. The treaty was then made public; and, notwithstanding the\r\nunfavorable import of the terms to France, the peace, if we except some\r\nambitious spirits, who would have found their account in the continuance\r\nof hostilities, was welcomed with joy by the whole nation. In this\r\nsentiment all the parties to the war participated. The more remote, like\r\nSpain, rejoiced to be delivered from a contest which made such large\r\ndrains on their finances; while France had an additional reason for\r\ndesiring peace, now that her own territory had become the theatre of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe reputation which Philip had acquired by his campaigns was greatly\r\nheightened by the result of his negotiations. The whole course of these\r\nnegotiations--long and intricate as it was--is laid open to us in the\r\ncorrespondence fortunately preserved among the papers of Granvelle; and\r\nthe student who explores these pages may probably rise from them with\r\nthe conviction that the Spanish plenipotentiaries showed an address, a\r\nknowledge of the men they had to deal with, and a consummate policy, in\r\nwhich neither their French nor English rivals were a match for them. The\r\nnegotiation all passed under the eyes of Philip. Every move in the game,\r\nif not by his suggestion, had been made at least with his sanction. The\r\nresult placed him in honorable contrast to Henry the Second, who, while\r\nPhilip had stood firmly by his allies, had, in his eagerness for peace,\r\nabandoned those of France to their fate.\r\n\r\nThe early campaigns of Philip had wiped away the disgrace caused by the\r\nclosing campaigns of Charles the Fifth; and by the treaty he had\r\nnegotiated, the number of towns which he lost was less than that of\r\nprovinces which he gained.[271] Thus he had shown himself as skilful in\r\ncounsel as he had been successful in the field. Victorious in Picardy\r\nand in Naples, he had obtained the terms of a victor from the king of\r\nFrance, and humbled the arrogance of Rome, in a war to which he had been\r\ndriven in self-defence.[272] Faithful to his allies and formidable to\r\nhis foes, there was probably no period of Philip's life in which he\r\npossessed so much real consideration in the eyes of Europe, as at the\r\ntime of signing the treaty of Cateau-Cambresis.\r\n\r\nIn order to cement the union between the different powers, and to\r\nconciliate the good-will of the French nation to the treaty by giving it\r\nsomewhat of the air of a marriage contract, it was proposed that an\r\nalliance should take place between the royal houses of France and Spain.\r\nIt was first arranged that the hand of Henry's daughter, the Princess\r\nElizabeth, should be given to Carlos, the son and heir of Philip. The\r\nparties were of nearly the same age, being each about fourteen years\r\nold. Now that all prospect of the English match had vanished, it was\r\nthought to be a greater compliment to the French to substitute the\r\nfather for the son, the monarch himself for the heir apparent, in the\r\nmarriage treaty. The disparity of years between Philip and Elizabeth was\r\nnot such as to present any serious objection. The proposition was said\r\nto have come from the French negotiators. The Spanish envoys replied,\r\nthat, notwithstanding their master's repugnance to entering again into\r\nwedlock, yet, from his regard to the French monarch, and his desire for\r\nthe public weal, he would consent to waive his scruples, and accept the\r\nhand of the French princess, with the same dowry which had been promised\r\nto his son Don Carlos.[273]\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth seems to have been not a little piqued by the\r\nintelligence that Philip had so soon consoled himself for the failure of\r\nhis suit to her. \"Your master,\" said she, in a petulant tone, to Feria,\r\n\"must have been much in love with me not to be able to wait four\r\nmonths!\" The ambassador answered somewhat bluntly, by throwing the blame\r\nof the affair on the queen herself. \"Not so,\" she retorted, \"I never\r\ngave your king a decided answer.\" \"True,\" said Feria, \"the refusal was\r\nonly implied, for I would not urge your highness to a downright 'No,'\r\nlest it might prove a cause of offence between so great princes.\"[274]\r\n\r\nIn June, 1559, the duke of Alva entered France for the purpose of\r\nclaiming the royal bride, and espousing her in the name of his master.\r\nHe was accompanied by Ruy Gomez, count of Melito,--better known by his\r\ntitle of prince of Eboli,--by the prince of Orange, the Count Egmont,\r\nand other noblemen, whose high rank and character might give lustre to\r\nthe embassy. He was received in great state by Henry, who, with his\r\nwhole court, seemed anxious to show to the envoy every mark of respect\r\nthat could testify their satisfaction with the object of his mission.\r\nThe duke displayed all the stately demeanor of a true Spanish hidalgo.\r\nAlthough he conformed to the French usage by saluting the ladies of the\r\ncourt, he declined taking this liberty with his future queen, or\r\ncovering himself, as repeatedly urged, in her presence,--a piece of\r\npunctilio greatly admired by the French, as altogether worthy of the\r\nnoble Castilian breeding.[275]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEATH OF HENRY THE SECOND.]\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fourth of June, the marriage of the young princess was\r\ncelebrated in the church of St. Mary. King Henry gave his daughter away.\r\nThe duke of Alva acted as his sovereign's proxy. At the conclusion of\r\nthe ceremony, the prince of Eboli placed on the finger of the princess,\r\nas a memento from her lord, a diamond ring of inestimable value; and the\r\nbeautiful Elizabeth, the destined bride of Don Carlos, became the bride\r\nof the king his father. It was an ominous union, destined, in its\r\nmysterious consequences, to supply a richer theme for the pages of\r\nromance than for those of history.\r\n\r\nThe wedding was followed by a succession of brilliant entertainments,\r\nthe chief of which was the tournament,--the most splendid pageant of\r\nthat spectacle-loving age. Henry was, at that time, busily occupied with\r\nthe work of exterminating the Protestant heresy, which, as already\r\nnoticed, had begun to gather formidable head in the capital of his\r\ndominions.[276] On the evening of the fifteenth of June, he attended a\r\nsession of the parliament, and arrested some of its principal members\r\nfor the boldness of their speech in his presence. He ordered them into\r\nconfinement, deferring their sentence till the termination of the\r\nengrossing business of the tourney.\r\n\r\nThe king delighted in these martial exercises, in which he could display\r\nhis showy person and matchless horsemanship in the presence of the\r\nassembled beauty and fashion of his court.[277] He fully maintained his\r\nreputation on this occasion, carrying off one prize after another, and\r\nbearing down all who encountered his lance. Towards evening, when the\r\ngames had drawn to a close, he observed the young count of Montgomery, a\r\nScotch noble, the captain of his guard, leaning on his lance, as yet\r\nunbroken. The king challenged the cavalier to run a course with him for\r\nhis lady's sake. In vain the queen, with a melancholy boding of some\r\ndisaster, besought her lord to remain content with the laurels he had\r\nalready won. Henry obstinately urged his fate, and compelled the count,\r\nthough extremely loth, to take the saddle. The champions met with a\r\nfurious shock in the middle of the lists. Montgomery was a rude jouster.\r\nHe directed his lance with such force against the helmet of his\r\nantagonist, that the bars of the visor gave way. The lance splintered; a\r\nfragment struck the king with such violence on the temple as to lay bare\r\nthe eye. The unhappy monarch reeled in his saddle, and would have fallen\r\nbut for the assistance of the constable, the duke of Guise, and other\r\nnobles, who bore him in their arms senseless from the lists. Henry's\r\nwound was mortal. He lingered ten days in great agony, and expired on\r\nthe ninth of July, in the forty-second year of his age, and the\r\nthirteenth of his reign. It was an ill augury for the nuptials of\r\nElizabeth.[278]\r\n\r\nThe tidings of the king's death were received with demonstrations of\r\nsorrow throughout the kingdom. He had none of those solid qualities\r\nwhich make either a great or a good prince. But he had the showy\r\nqualities which are perhaps more effectual to secure the affections of a\r\npeople as fond of show as the nation whom Henry governed.[279] There\r\nwere others in the kingdom, however,--that growing sect of the\r\nHuguenots,--who looked on the monarch's death with very different\r\neyes,--who rejoiced in it as a deliverance from persecution. They had\r\nlittle cause to rejoice. The sceptre passed into the hands of a line of\r\nimbecile princes, or rather of their mother, the famous Catherine de\r\nMedicis, who reigned in their stead, and who ultimately proved herself\r\nthe most merciless foe the Huguenots ever encountered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nLATTER DAYS OF CHARLES THE FIFTH.\r\n\r\nCharles at Yuste.--His Mode of Life.--Interest in Public\r\nAffairs.--Celebrates his Obsequies.--Last Illness.--Death and Character.\r\n\r\n1556-1558.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the occurrences related in the preceding chapter were passing, an\r\nevent took place which, had it happened earlier, would have had an\r\nimportant influence on the politics of Europe, and the news of which,\r\nwhen it did happen, was everywhere received with the greatest interest.\r\nThis event was the death of the Emperor Charles the Fifth, in his\r\nmonastic retreat at Yuste. In the earlier pages of our narrative, we\r\nhave seen how that monarch, after his abdication of the throne, withdrew\r\nto the Jeronymite convent among the hills of Estremadura. The reader may\r\nnow feel some interest in following him thither, and in observing in\r\nwhat manner he accommodated himself to the change, and passed the\r\nclosing days of his eventful life. The picture I am enabled to give of\r\nit will differ in some respects from those of former historians, who\r\nwrote when the Archives of Simancas, which afford the most authentic\r\nrecords for the narrative, were inaccessible to the scholar, native as\r\nwell as foreign.[280]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHARLES AT YUSTE.]\r\n\r\nCharles, as we have seen, had early formed the determination to\r\nrelinquish at some future time the cares of royalty, and devote\r\nhimself, in some lonely retreat to the good work of his salvation. His\r\nconsort, the Empress Isabella, as appears from his own statement at\r\nYuste, had avowed the same pious purpose.[281] She died, however, too\r\nearly to execute her plan; and Charles was too much occupied with his\r\nambitious enterprises to accomplish his object until the autumn of 1555,\r\nwhen, broken in health and spirits, and disgusted with the world, he\r\nresigned the sceptre he had held for forty years, and withdrew to a life\r\nof obscurity and repose.\r\n\r\nThe spot he had selected for his residence was situated about seven\r\nleagues from the city of Plasencia, on the slopes of the mountain chain\r\nthat traverses the province of Estremadura. There, nestling among the\r\nrugged hills, clothed with thick woods of chestnut and oak, the\r\nJeronymite convent was sheltered from the rude breezes of the north.\r\nTowards the south, the land sloped by a gradual declivity, till it\r\nterminated in a broad expanse, the _Vera_ of Plasencia, as it was\r\ncalled, which, fertilized by the streams of the sierra, contrasted\r\nstrongly in its glowing vegetation with the wild character of the\r\nmountain scenery. It was a spot well fitted for such as would withdraw\r\nthemselves from commerce with the world, and consecrate their days to\r\nprayer and holy meditation. The Jeronymite fraternity had prospered in\r\nthis peaceful abode. Many of the monks had acquired reputation for\r\nsanctity, and some of them for learning, the fruits of which might be\r\nseen in a large collection of manuscripts preserved in the library of\r\nthe monastery. Benefactions were heaped on the brotherhood. They became\r\nproprietors of considerable tracts of land in the neighborhood, and they\r\nliberally employed their means in dispensing alms to the poor who sought\r\nit at the gate of the convent. Not long before Charles took up his\r\nresidence among them, they had enlarged their building by an extensive\r\nquadrangle, which displayed some architectural elegance in the\r\nconstruction of its cloisters.\r\n\r\nThree years before the emperor repaired thither, he sent a skilful\r\narchitect to provide such accommodations as he had designed for himself.\r\nThese were very simple. A small building, containing eight rooms, four\r\non each floor, was raised against the southern wall of the monastery.\r\nThe rooms were low, and of a moderate size. They were protected by\r\nporticos, which sheltered them on two sides from the rays of the sun,\r\nwhile an open gallery, which passed through the centre of the house,\r\nafforded means for its perfect ventilation. But Charles, with his gouty\r\nconstitution, was more afraid of the cold damps than of heat; and he\r\ntook care to have the apartments provided with fire-places, a luxury\r\nlittle known in this temperate region.\r\n\r\nA window opened from his chamber directly into the chapel of the\r\nmonastery; and through this, when confined to his bed, and too ill to\r\nattend mass, he could see the elevation of the host. The furniture of\r\nthe dwelling--according to an authority usually followed--was of the\r\nsimplest kind; and Charles, we are told, took no better care of his\r\ngouty limbs than to provide himself with an arm-chair, or rather half a\r\nchair, which would not have brought four reals at auction.[282] The\r\ninventory of the furniture of Yuste tells a very different story.\r\nInstead of \"half an arm-chair,\" we find, besides other chairs lined with\r\nvelvet, two arm-chairs especially destined to the emperor's service. One\r\nof these was of a peculiar construction, and was accommodated with no\r\nless than six cushions and a footstool, for the repose of his gouty\r\nlimbs. His wardrobe showed a similar attention to his personal comfort.\r\nFor one item we find no less than sixteen robes of silk and velvet,\r\nlined with ermine or eider-down, or the soft hair of the Barbary goat.\r\nThe decorations of his apartment were on not merely a comfortable, but a\r\nluxurious scale;--canopies of velvet; carpets from Turkey and Alcaraz;\r\nsuits of tapestry, of which twenty-five pieces are specified, richly\r\nwrought with figures of flowers and animals. Twelve hangings, of the\r\nfinest black cloth, were for the emperor's bed-chamber, which, since his\r\nmother's death, had been always dressed in mourning. Among the ornaments\r\nof his rooms were four large clocks of elaborate workmanship. He had\r\nbesides a number of pocket-watches, then a greater rarity than at\r\npresent. He was curious in regard to his timepieces, and took care to\r\nprovide for their regularity by bringing the manufacturer of them in his\r\ntrain to Yuste. Charles was served on silver. Even the meanest utensils\r\nfor his kitchen and his sleeping apartment were of the same costly\r\nmaterial, amounting to nearly fourteen thousand ounces in weight.[283]\r\n\r\nThe inventory contains rather a meagre show of books, which were for the\r\nmost part of a devotional character. But Charles's love of art was\r\nvisible in a small but choice collection of paintings, which he brought\r\nwith him to adorn the walls of his retreat. Nine of these were from the\r\npencil of Titian. Charles held the works of the great Venetian in the\r\nhighest honor, and was desirous that by his hand his likeness should be\r\ntransmitted to posterity. The emperor had brought with him to Yuste four\r\nportraits of himself and the empress by Titian; and among the other\r\npieces by the same master were some of his best pictures. One of these\r\nwas the famous \"Gloria,\" in which Charles and the empress appear, in the\r\nmidst of the celestial throng, supported by angels, and in an attitude\r\nof humble adoration.[284] He had the painting hung at the foot of his\r\nbed, or according to another account, over the great altar in the\r\nchapel. It is said, he would gaze long and fondly on this picture, which\r\nfilled him with the most tender recollections; and as he dwelt on the\r\nimage of one who had been so dear to him on earth, he may have looked\r\nforward to his reunion with her in the heavenly mansions, as the artist\r\nhad here depicted him.[285]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHARLES AT YUSTE.]\r\n\r\nA stairway, or rather an inclined plane, suited to the weakness of\r\nCharles's limbs, led from the gallery of his house to the gardens below.\r\nThese were surrounded by a high wall, which completely secluded him from\r\nobservation from without. The garden was filled with orange, citron, and\r\nfig trees, and various aromatic plants that grew luxuriantly in the\r\ngenial soil. The emperor had a taste for horticulture, and took much\r\npleasure in tending the young plants and pruning his trees. His garden\r\nafforded him also the best means for taking exercise; and in fine\r\nweather he would walk along an avenue of lofty chestnut-trees, that led\r\nto a pretty chapel in the neighboring woods, the ruins of which may be\r\nseen at this day. Among the trees, one is pointed out,--an overgrown\r\nwalnut, still throwing its shade far and wide over the ground,--under\r\nwhose branches the pensive monarch would sit and meditate on the dim\r\nfuture, or perhaps on the faded glories of the past.\r\n\r\nCharles had once been the most accomplished horseman of his time. He had\r\nbrought with him to Yuste a pony and a mule, in the hope of being able\r\nto get some exercise in the saddle. But the limbs that had bestrode day\r\nafter day, without fatigue, the heavy war-horse of Flanders and the\r\nwildest genet of Andalusia, were unable now to endure the motion of a\r\npoor palfrey; and, after a solitary experiment in the saddle on his\r\narrival at Yuste, when he nearly fainted, he abandoned it for ever.[286]\r\n\r\nThere are few spots that might now be visited with more interest, than\r\nthat which the great emperor had selected as his retreat from the thorny\r\ncares of government. And until within a few years the traveller would\r\nhave received from the inmates of the convent the same hospitable\r\nwelcome which they had always been ready to give to the stranger. But in\r\n1809 the place was sacked by the French; and the fierce soldiery of\r\nSoult converted the pile, with its venerable cloisters, into a heap of\r\nblackened ruins. Even the collection of manuscripts, piled up with so\r\nmuch industry by the brethren, did not escape the general doom. The\r\n_palace_ of the emperor, as the simple monks loved to call his dwelling,\r\nhad hardly a better fate, though it came from the hands of Charles's own\r\ncountrymen, the liberals of Cuacos. By these patriots the lower floor of\r\nthe mansion was turned into stables for their horses. The rooms above\r\nwere used as magazines for grain. The mulberry-leaves were gathered from\r\nthe garden to furnish material for the silkworm, who was permitted to\r\nwind his cocoon in the deserted chambers of royalty. Still the great\r\nfeatures of nature remain the same as in Charles's day. The bald peaks\r\nof the sierra still rise above the ruins of the monastery. The shaggy\r\nsides of the hills still wear their wild forest drapery. Far below, the\r\neye of the traveller ranges over the beautiful _Vera_ of Plasencia,\r\nwhich glows in the same exuberant vegetation as of yore; and the\r\ntraveller, as he wanders among the ruined porticos and desolate arcades\r\nof the palace, drinks in the odors of a thousand aromatic plants and\r\nwild-flowers that have shot up into a tangled wilderness, where once was\r\nthe garden of the imperial recluse.[287]\r\n\r\nCharles, though borne across the mountains in a litter, had suffered\r\ngreatly in his long and laborious journey from Valladolid. He passed\r\nsome time in the neighboring village of Xarandilla, and thence, after\r\ntaking leave of the greater part of his weeping retinue, he proceeded\r\nwith the remainder to the monastery of Yuste. It was on the third of\r\nFebruary, 1557, that he entered the abode which was to prove his final\r\nresting-place.[288] The monks of Yuste had been much flattered by the\r\ncircumstance of Charles having shown such a preference for their\r\nconvent. As he entered the chapel, Te Deum was chanted by the whole\r\nbrotherhood; and when the emperor had prostrated himself before the\r\naltar, the monks gathered round him, anxious to pay him their respectful\r\nobeisance. Charles received them graciously, and, after examining his\r\nquarters, professed himself well pleased with the accommodations\r\nprepared for him. His was not a fickle temper. Slow in forming his\r\nplans, he was slower in changing them. To the last day of his residence\r\nat Yuste,--whatever may have been said to the contrary,--he seems to\r\nhave been well satisfied with the step he had taken and with the spot he\r\nhad selected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS MODE OF LIFE.]\r\n\r\nFrom the first, he prepared to conform, as far as his health would\r\npermit, to the religious observances of the monastery. Not that he\r\nproposed to limit himself to the narrow circumstances of an ordinary\r\nfriar. The number of his retinue that still remained with him was at\r\nleast fifty, mostly Flemings;[289] a number not greater, certainly, than\r\nthat maintained by many a private gentleman of the country. But among\r\nthese we recognize those officers of state who belong more properly to a\r\nprincely establishment than to the cell of the recluse. There was the\r\nmajor-domo, the almoner, the keeper of the wardrobe, the keeper of the\r\njewels, the chamberlains, two watchmakers, several secretaries, the\r\nphysician, the confessor, besides cooks, confectioners, bakers, brewers,\r\ngame-keepers, and numerous valets. Some of these followers seem not to\r\nhave been quite so content as their master with their secluded way of\r\nlife, and to have cast many a longing look to the pomps and vanities of\r\nthe world they had left behind them. At least such were the feelings of\r\nQuixada, the emperor's major-domo, in whom he placed the greatest\r\nconfidence, and who had the charge of his household. \"His majesty's\r\nbedroom,\" writes the querulous functionary, \"is good enough; but the\r\nview from it is poor,--barren mountains, covered with rocks and stunted\r\noaks; a garden of moderate size, with a few straggling orange-trees; the\r\nroads scarcely passable, so steep and stony; the only water, a torrent\r\nrushing from the mountains; a dreary solitude!\" The low, cheerless\r\nrooms, he predicts, must necessarily be damp, boding no good to the\r\nemperor's infirmity.[290] \"As to the friars,\" observes the secretary,\r\nGaztelu, in the same amiable mood, \"please God that his majesty may be\r\nable to tolerate them,--which will be no easy matter; for they are an\r\nimportunate race.\"[291] It is evident that Charles's followers would\r\nhave been very willing to exchange the mortifications of the monastic\r\nlife for the good cheer and gaiety of Brussels.\r\n\r\nThe worthy prior of the convent, in addressing Charles, greeted him with\r\nthe title of _paternidad_, till one of the fraternity suggested to him\r\nthe propriety of substituting that of _magestad_.[292] Indeed, to this\r\ntitle Charles had good right, for he was still emperor. His resignation\r\nof the imperial crown, which, as we have seen, so soon followed that of\r\nthe Spanish, had not taken effect, in consequence of the diet not being\r\nin session at the time when his envoy, the prince of Orange, was to have\r\npresented himself at Ratisbon, in the spring of 1557. The war with\r\nFrance made Philip desirous that his father should remain lord of\r\nGermany for some time longer. It was not, therefore, until more than a\r\nyear after Charles's arrival at Yuste, that the resignation was accepted\r\nby the diet, at Frankfort, on the twenty-eighth of February, 1558.\r\nCharles was still emperor, and continued to receive the imperial title\r\nin all his correspondence.[293]\r\n\r\nWe have pretty full accounts of the manner in which the monarch employed\r\nhis time. He attended mass every morning in the chapel, when his health\r\npermitted. Mass was followed by dinner, which he took early and alone,\r\npreferring this to occupying a seat in the refectory of the convent. He\r\nwas fond of carving for himself, though his gouty fingers were not\r\nalways in the best condition for this exercise.[294] His physician was\r\nusually in attendance during the repast, and might, at least, observe\r\nhow little his patient, who had not the virtue of abstinence, regarded\r\nhis prescriptions. The Fleming, Van Male, the emperor's favorite\r\ngentleman of the chamber, was also not unfrequently present. He was a\r\ngood scholar; and his discussions with the doctor served to beguile the\r\ntediousness of their master's solitary meal. The conversation frequently\r\nturned on some subject of natural history, of which the emperor was\r\nfond; and when the parties could not agree, the confessor, a man of\r\nlearning, was called in to settle the dispute.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner,--an important meal, which occupied much time with\r\nCharles,--he listened to some passages from a favorite theologian. In\r\nhis worldly days, the book he most affected is said to have been\r\nComines's Life of Louis the Eleventh,[295]--a prince whose maxim, \"_Qui\r\nnescit dissimulare, nescit regnare_,\" was too well suited to the genius\r\nof the emperor. He now, however, sought a safer guide for his spiritual\r\ndirection, and would listen to a homily from the pages of St. Bernard,\r\nor more frequently St. Augustine, in whom he most delighted.[296]\r\nTowards evening, he heard a sermon from one of his preachers. Three or\r\nfour of the most eloquent of the Jeronymite order had been brought to\r\nYuste for his especial benefit. When he was not in condition to be\r\npresent at the discourse, he expected to hear a full report of it from\r\nthe lips of his confessor, Father Juan de Regla. Charles was punctual in\r\nhis attention to all the great fasts and festivals of the Church. His\r\ninfirmities, indeed, excused him from fasting, but he made up for it by\r\nthe severity of his flagellation. In Lent, in particular, he dealt with\r\nhimself so sternly, that the scourge was found stained with his blood;\r\nand this precious memorial of his piety was ever cherished, we are told,\r\nby Philip, and by him bequeathed as an heirloom to his son.[297]\r\n\r\nIncreasing vigilance in his own spiritual concerns made him more\r\nvigilant as to those of others,--as the weaker brethren sometimes found\r\nto their cost. Observing that some of the younger friars spent more time\r\nthan was seemly in conversing with the women who came on business to the\r\ndoor of the convent, Charles procured an order to be passed, that any\r\nwoman who ventured to approach within two bowshots of the gate should\r\nreceive a hundred stripes.[298] On another occasion, his officious\r\nendeavor to quicken the diligence of one of the younger members of the\r\nfraternity _is said_ to have provoked the latter testily to exclaim,\r\n\"Cannot you be contented with having so long turned the world upside\r\ndown, without coming here to disturb the quiet of a poor convent?\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS MODE OF LIFE.]\r\n\r\nHe derived an additional pleasure, in his spiritual exercises, from his\r\nfondness for music, which enters so largely into those of the Romish\r\nChurch. He sung well himself, and his clear, sonorous voice might often\r\nbe heard through the open casement of his bedroom, accompanying the\r\nchant of the monks in the chapel. The choir was made up altogether of\r\nbrethren of the order, and Charles would allow no intrusion from any\r\nother quarter. His ear was quick to distinguish any strange voice, as\r\nwell as any false note in the performance,--on which last occasion he\r\nwould sometimes pause in his devotions, and, in half-suppressed tones,\r\ngive vent to his anger by one of those scurrilous epithets, which,\r\nhowever they may have fallen in with the habits of the old campaigner,\r\nwere but indifferently suited to his present way of life.[299]\r\n\r\nSuch time as was not given to his religious exercises was divided among\r\nvarious occupations, for which he had always had a relish, though\r\nhitherto but little leisure to pursue them. Besides his employments in\r\nhis garden, he had a decided turn for mechanical pursuits. Some years\r\nbefore, while in Germany, he had invented an ingenious kind of carriage\r\nfor his own accommodation.[300] He brought with him to Yuste an engineer\r\nnamed Torriano, famous for the great hydraulic works he constructed in\r\nToledo. With the assistance of this man, a most skilful mechanician,\r\nCharles amused himself by making a variety of puppets representing\r\nsoldiers, who went through military exercises. The historian draws\r\nlargely on our faith, by telling us also of little wooden birds which\r\nthe ingenious pair contrived, so as to fly in and out of the window\r\nbefore the admiring monks![301] But nothing excited their astonishment\r\nso much as a little hand-mill, used for grinding wheat, which turned out\r\nmeal enough in a single day to support a man for a week or more. The\r\ngood fathers thought this savored of downright necromancy; and it may\r\nhave furnished an argument against the unfortunate engineer in the\r\npersecution which he afterwards underwent from the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nCharles took, moreover, great interest in the mechanism of timepieces.\r\nHe had a good number of clocks and watches ticking together in his\r\napartments; and a story has obtained credit, that the difficulty he\r\nfound in making any two of them keep the same time drew from him an\r\nexclamation on the folly of attempting to bring a number of men to think\r\nalike in matters of religion, when he could not regulate any two of his\r\ntimepieces so as to make them agree with each other; a philosophical\r\nreflection for which one will hardly give credit to the man who, with\r\nhis dying words, could press on his son the maintenance of the\r\nInquisition as the great bulwark of the Catholic faith. In the gardens\r\nof Yuste there is still, or was lately, to be seen, a sun-dial\r\nconstructed by Torriano to enable his master to measure more accurately\r\nthe lapse of time as it glided away in the monotonous routine of the\r\nmonastery.[302]\r\n\r\nThough averse to visits of curiosity or idle ceremony,[303] Charles\r\nconsented to admit some of the nobles whose estates lay in the\r\nsurrounding country, and who, with feelings of loyal attachment to their\r\nancient master, were anxious to pay their respects to him in his\r\nretirement. But none who found their way into his retreat appear to have\r\ngiven him so much satisfaction as Francisco Borja, duke of Gandia, in\r\nlater times placed on the roll of her saints by the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch. Like Charles, he had occupied a brilliant eminence in the world,\r\nand like him had found the glory of this world but vanity. In the prime\r\nof life, he withdrew from the busy scenes in which he had acted, and\r\nentered a college of Jesuits. By the emperor's invitation, Borja made\r\nmore than one visit to Yuste; and Charles found much consolation in his\r\nsociety, and in conversing with his early friend on topics of engrossing\r\ninterest to both. The result of their conferences was to confirm them\r\nboth in the conviction, that they had done wisely in abjuring the world,\r\nand in dedicating themselves to the service of Heaven.\r\n\r\nThe emperor was also visited by his two sisters, the dowager queens of\r\nFrance and Hungary, who had accompanied their brother, as we have seen,\r\non his return to Spain. But the travelling was too rough, and the\r\naccommodations at Yuste too indifferent, to encourage the royal matrons\r\nto prolong their stay, or, with one exception on the part of the queen\r\nof Hungary, to repeat their visit.\r\n\r\nBut an object of livelier interest to the emperor than either of his\r\nsisters was a boy, scarcely twelve years of age, who resided in the\r\nfamily of his major-domo, Quixada, in the neighboring village of Cuacos.\r\nThis was Don John of Austria, as he was afterwards called, the future\r\nhero of Lepanto. He was the natural son of Charles, a fact known to no\r\none during the father's lifetime, except Quixada, who introduced the boy\r\ninto the convent as his own page. The lad, at this early age, showed\r\nmany gleams of that generous spirit by which he was afterwards\r\ndistinguished,--thus solacing the declining years of his parent, and\r\naffording a hold for those affections which might have withered in the\r\ncold atmosphere of the cloister.\r\n\r\nStrangers were sure to be well received who, coming from the theatre of\r\nwar, could furnish the information he so much desired respecting the\r\ncondition of things abroad. Thus we find him in conference with an\r\nofficer arrived from the Low Countries, named Spinosa, and putting a\r\nmultitude of questions respecting the state of the army, the\r\norganization and equipment of the different corps, and other\r\nparticulars, showing the lively interest taken by Charles in the conduct\r\nof the campaign.[304]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS INTEREST IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS.]\r\n\r\nIt has been a common opinion, that the emperor, after his retirement to\r\nYuste, remained as one buried alive, totally cut off from intercourse\r\nwith the world;--\"as completely withdrawn from the business of the\r\nkingdom and the concerns of government,\" says one of his biographers,\r\n\"as if he had never taken part in them;\"[305]--\"so entirely abstracted\r\nin his solitude,\" says another contemporary, \"that neither revolutions\r\nnor wars, nor gold arriving in heaps from the Indies, had any power to\r\naffect his tranquillity.\"[306]\r\n\r\nSo far from this being the case, that not only did the emperor continue\r\nto show an interest in public affairs, but he took a prominent part,\r\neven from the depths of his retreat, in the management of them.[307]\r\nPhilip, who had the good sense to defer to the long experience and the\r\nwisdom of his father, consulted him, constantly, on great questions of\r\npublic policy. And so far was he from the feeling of jealousy often\r\nimputed to him, that we find him on one occasion, when the horizon\r\nlooked particularly, dark, imploring the emperor to leave his retreat,\r\nand to aid him not only by his counsels, but by his presence and\r\nauthority.[308] The emperor's daughter Joanna, regent of Castile, from\r\nher residence at Valladolid, only fifty leagues from Yuste, maintained a\r\nconstant correspondence with her father, soliciting his advice in the\r\nconduct of the government. However much Charles may have felt himself\r\nrelieved from responsibility for measures, he seems to have been as\r\nanxious for the success of Philip's administration as if it had been his\r\nown. \"Write more fully,\" says one of his secretaries in a letter to the\r\nsecretary of the regent's council; \"the emperor is always eager to hear\r\nmore particulars of events.\"[309] He showed the deepest concern in the\r\nconduct of the Italian war. He betrayed none of the scruples manifested\r\nby Philip, but boldly declared that the war with the pope was a just\r\nwar, in the sight of both God and man.[310] When letters came from\r\nabroad, he was even heard to express his regret that they brought no\r\ntidings of Paul's death, or Caraffa's![311] He was sorely displeased\r\nwith the truce which Alva granted to the pontiff, intimating a regret\r\nthat he had not the reins still in his own hand. He was yet more\r\ndiscontented with the peace, and the terms of it, both public and\r\nprivate; and when Alva talked of leaving Naples, his anger, as his\r\nsecretary quaintly remarks, was \"more than was good for his\r\nhealth.\"[312]\r\n\r\nThe same interest he showed in the French war. The loss of Calais filled\r\nhim with the deepest anxiety. But in his letters on the occasion,\r\ninstead of wasting his time in idle lament, he seems intent only on\r\ndevising in what way he can best serve Philip in his distress.[313] In\r\nthe same proportion he was elated by the tidings of the victory of St.\r\nQuentin. His thoughts turned upon Paris, and he was eager to learn what\r\nroad his son had taken after the battle.[314] According to Brantôme, on\r\nhearing the news, he abruptly asked, \"Is Philip at Paris?\"--He judged of\r\nPhilip's temper by his own.[315]\r\n\r\nAt another time, we find him conducting negotiations with Navarre;[316]\r\nand then, again, carrying on a correspondence with his sister, the\r\nregent of Portugal, for the purpose of having his grandson, Carlos,\r\nrecognized as heir to the crown, in case of the death of the young king,\r\nhis cousin. The scheme failed, for it would be as much as her life was\r\nworth, the regent said, to engage in it. But it was a bold one, that of\r\nbringing under the same sceptre these two nations, which, by community\r\nof race, language, and institutions, would seem by nature to have been\r\ndesigned for one. It was Charles's comprehensive idea; and it proves\r\nthat, even in the cloister, the spirit of ambition had not become\r\nextinct in his bosom. How much would it have rejoiced that ambitious\r\nspirit, could he have foreseen that the consummation so much desired by\r\nhim would be attained under Philip![317]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS INTEREST IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS.]\r\n\r\nBut the department which especially engaged Charles's attention in his\r\nretirement, singularly enough, was the financial. \"It has been my\r\nconstant care,\" he writes to Philip, \"in all my letters to your sister,\r\nto urge the necessity of providing you with funds,--since I can be of\r\nlittle service to you in any other way.\"[318] His interposition, indeed,\r\nseems to have been constantly invoked to raise supplies for carrying on\r\nthe war. This fact may be thought to show that those writers are\r\nmistaken who accuse Philip of withholding from his father the means of\r\nmaintaining a suitable establishment at Yuste. Charles, in truth,\r\nsettled the amount of his own income; and in one of his letters we find\r\nhim fixing this at twenty thousand ducats, instead of sixteen thousand,\r\nas before, to be paid quarterly and in advance.[319] That the payments\r\nwere not always punctually made may well be believed, in a country where\r\npunctuality would have been a miracle.\r\n\r\nCharles had more cause for irritation in the conduct of some of those\r\nfunctionaries with whom he had to deal in his financial capacity.\r\nNothing appears to have stirred his bile so much at Yuste as the\r\nproceedings of some members of the board of trade at Seville. \"I have\r\ndeferred sending to you,\" he writes to his daughter, the regent, \"in\r\norder to see if, with time, my wrath would not subside. But, far from\r\nit, it increases, and will go on increasing till I learn that those who\r\nhave done wrong have atoned for it. Were it not for my infirmities,\" he\r\nadds, \"I would go to Seville myself, and find out the authors of this\r\nvillany, and bring them to a summary reckoning.\"[320] \"The emperor\r\norders me,\" writes his secretary, Gaztelu, \"to command that the\r\noffenders be put in irons, and in order to mortify them the more, that\r\nthey be carried, in broad daylight, to Simancas, and there lodged, not\r\nin towers or chambers, but in a dungeon. Indeed, such is his\r\nindignation, and such are the _violent and bloodthirsty expressions_ he\r\ncommands me to use, that you will pardon me if my language is not so\r\ntemperate as it might be.\"[321] It had been customary for the board of\r\ntrade to receive the gold imported from the Indies, whether on public or\r\nprivate account, and hold it for the use of the government, paying to\r\nthe merchants interested an equivalent in government bonds. The\r\nmerchants, naturally enough, not relishing this kind of security so well\r\nas the gold, by a collusion with some of the members of the board of\r\ntrade, had been secretly allowed to remove their own property. In this\r\nway the government was defrauded--as the emperor regarded it--of a large\r\nsum on which it had calculated. This, it would seem, was the offence\r\nwhich had roused the royal indignation to such a pitch. Charles's\r\nphlegmatic temperament had ever been liable to be ruffled by these\r\nsudden gusts of passion; and his conventual life does not seem to have\r\nhad any very sedative influence on him in this particular.\r\n\r\nFor the first ten months after his arrival at Yuste, the emperor's\r\nhealth, under the influence of a temperate climate, the quiet of\r\nmonastic life, and more than all, probably, his exemption from the cares\r\nof state, had generally improved.[322] His attacks of gout had been less\r\nfrequent and less severe than before. But in the spring of 1558, the old\r\nmalady returned with renewed violence. \"I was not in a condition,\" he\r\nwrites to Philip, \"to listen to a single sermon during Lent.\"[323] For\r\nmonths he was scarcely able to write a line with his own hand. His\r\nspirits felt the pressure of bodily suffering, and were still further\r\ndepressed by the death of his sister Eleanor, the queen-dowager of\r\nFrance and Portugal, which took place in February, 1558.\r\n\r\nA strong attachment seems to have subsisted between the emperor and his\r\ntwo sisters. Queen Eleanor's sweetness of disposition had particularly\r\nendeared her to her brother, who now felt her loss almost as keenly as\r\nthat of one of his own children. \"She was a good Christian,\" he said to\r\nhis secretary, Gaztelu; and, as the tears rolled down his cheeks, he\r\nadded, \"We have always loved each other. She was my elder by fifteen\r\nmonths; and before that period has passed I shall probably be with\r\nher.\"[324] Before half that period, the sad augury was fulfilled.\r\n\r\nAt this period--as we shall see hereafter--the attention of the\r\ngovernment was called to the Lutheran heresy, which had already begun to\r\ndisclose itself in various quarters of the country. Charles was\r\npossessed of a full share of the spirit of bigotry which belonged to the\r\nroyal line of Castile, from which he was descended. While on the throne,\r\nthis feeling was held somewhat in check by a regard for his political\r\ninterests. But in the seclusion of the monastery he had no interests to\r\nconsult but those of religion; and he gave free scope to the spirit of\r\nintolerance which belonged to his nature. In a letter addressed, the\r\nthird of May, 1558, to his daughter Joanna, he says: \"Tell the\r\ngrand-inquisitor from me to be at his post, and lay the axe at the root\r\nof the evil before it spreads further. I rely on your zeal for bringing\r\nthe guilty to punishment, and for having them punished, without favor to\r\nany one, with all the severity which their crimes demand.\"[325] In\r\nanother letter to his daughter, three weeks later, he writes: \"If I had\r\nnot entire confidence that you would do your duty, and arrest the evil\r\nat once by chastising the guilty in good earnest, I know not how I\r\ncould help leaving the monastery, and taking the remedy into my own\r\nhands.\"[326] Thus did Charles make his voice heard from his retreat\r\namong the mountains, and by his efforts and influence render himself\r\nlargely responsible for the fiery persecution which brought woe upon the\r\nland after he himself had gone to his account.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HE CELEBRATES HIS OBSEQUIES.]\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of August, the emperor's old enemy, the gout, returned\r\non him with uncommon force. It was attended with symptoms of an alarming\r\nkind, intimating, indeed, that his strong constitution was giving way.\r\nThese were attributed to a cold which he had taken, though it seems\r\nthere was good reason for imputing them to his intemperate living; for\r\nhe still continued to indulge his appetite for the most dangerous\r\ndishes, as freely as in the days when a more active way of life had\r\nbetter enabled him to digest them. It is true, the physician stood by\r\nhis side, as prompt as Sancho Panza's doctor, in his island domain, to\r\nremonstrate against his master's proceedings. But, unhappily, he was not\r\narmed with the authority of that functionary; and an eel-pie, a\r\nwell-spiced capon, or any other savory abomination, offered too great a\r\nfascination for Charles to heed the warnings of his physician.\r\n\r\nThe declining state of the emperor's health may have inspired him with a\r\npresentiment of his approaching end, to which, we have seen, he gave\r\nutterrance some time before this, in his conversation with Gaztelu. It\r\nmay have been the sober reflections which such a feeling would naturally\r\nsuggest that led him, at the close of the month of August, to conceive\r\nthe extraordinary idea of preparing for the final scene by rehearsing\r\nhis own funeral. He consulted his professor on the subject, and was\r\nencouraged by the accommodating father to consider it as a meritorious\r\nact. The chapel was accordingly hung in black, and the blaze of hundreds\r\nof wax-lights was not sufficient to dispel the darkness. The monks in\r\ntheir conventual dresses, and all the emperor's household, clad in deep\r\nmourning, gathered round a huge _catafalque_, shrouded also in black,\r\nwhich had been raised in the centre of the chapel. The service for the\r\nburial of the dead was then performed; and amidst the dismal wail of the\r\nmonks, the prayers ascended for the departed spirit, that it might be\r\nreceived into the mansions of the blessed. The sorrowful attendants were\r\nmelted to tears, as the image of their master's death was presented to\r\ntheir minds, or they were touched, it may be, with compassion for this\r\npitiable display of his weakness. Charles, muffled in a dark mantle, and\r\nbearing a lighted candle in his hand, mingled with his household, the\r\nspectator of his own obsequies; and the doleful ceremony was concluded\r\nby his placing the taper in the hands of the priest, in sign of his\r\nsurrendering up his soul to the Almighty.\r\n\r\nSuch is the account of this melancholy farce given us by the Jeronymite\r\nchroniclers of the cloister life of Charles the Fifth, and which has\r\nsince been repeated--losing nothing in the repetition--by every\r\nsucceeding historian, to the present time.[327] Nor does there seem to\r\nhave been any distrust of its correctness till the historical scepticism\r\nof our own day had subjected the narrative to a more critical scrutiny.\r\nIt was then discovered that no mention of the affair was to be discerned\r\nin the letters of any one of the emperor's household residing at Yuste,\r\nalthough there are letters extant written by Charles's physician, his\r\nmajor-domo, and his secretary, both on the thirty-first of August, the\r\nday of the funeral, and on the first of September. With so extraordinary\r\nan event fresh in their minds, their silence is inexplicable.\r\n\r\nOne fact is certain, that, if the funeral did take place, it could not\r\nhave been on the date assigned to it; for on the thirty-first the\r\nemperor was laboring under an attack of fever, of which his physician\r\nhas given full particulars, and from which he was destined never to\r\nrecover. That the writers, therefore, should have been silent in respect\r\nto a ceremony which must have had so bad an effect on the nerves of the\r\npatient, is altogether incredible.\r\n\r\nYet the story of the obsequies comes from one of the Jeronymite brethren\r\nthen living at Yuste, who speaks of the emotions which he felt, in\r\ncommon with the rest of the convent, at seeing a man thus bury himself\r\nalive, as it were, and perform his funeral rites before his death.[328]\r\nIt is repeated by another of the fraternity, the prior of Escorial, who\r\nhad ample means of conversing with eye-witnesses.[329] And finally, it\r\nis confirmed by more than one writer near enough to the period to be\r\nable to assure himself of the truth.[330] Indeed, the parties from whom\r\nthe account is originally derived were so situated that, if the story be\r\nwithout foundation, it is impossible to explain its existence by\r\nmisapprehension on their part. It must be wholly charged on a wilful\r\nmisstatement of facts. It is true, the monkish chronicler is not always\r\nquite so scrupulous in this particular as would be\r\ndesirable,--especially where the honor of his order is implicated. But\r\nwhat interest could the Jeronymite fathers have had in so foolish a\r\nfabrication as this? The supposition is at variance with the respectable\r\ncharacter of the parties, and with the air of simplicity and good faith\r\nthat belongs to their narratives.[331]\r\n\r\nWe may well be staggered, it is true, by the fact that no allusion to\r\nthe obsequies appears in any of the letters from Yuste; while the date\r\nassigned for them, moreover, is positively disproved. Yet we may\r\nconsider that the misstatement of a date is a very different thing from\r\nthe invention of a story; and that chronological accuracy, as I have\r\nmore than once had occasion to remark, was not the virtue of the\r\nmonkish, or indeed of any other historian of the sixteenth century. It\r\nwould not be a miracle if the obsequies should have taken place some\r\ndays before the period assigned to them. It so happens that we have no\r\nletters from Yuste between the eighteenth and twenty-eighth of August.\r\nAt least, I have none myself, and have seen none cited by others. If any\r\nshould hereafter come to light, written during that interval, they may\r\nbe found possibly to contain some allusion to the funeral. Should no\r\nletters have been written during the period, the silence of the parties\r\nwho wrote at the end of August and the beginning of September may be\r\nexplained by the fact, that too long a time had elapsed since the\r\nperformance of the emperor's obsequies, for them to suppose it could\r\nhave any connection with his illness, which formed the subject of their\r\ncorrespondence. Difficulties will present themselves, whichever view we\r\ntake of the matter. But the reader may think it quite as reasonable to\r\nexplain those difficulties by the supposition of involuntary error, as\r\nby that of sheer invention.\r\n\r\nNor is the former supposition rendered less probable by the character of\r\nCharles the Fifth. There was a taint of insanity in the royal blood of\r\nCastile, which was most fully displayed in the emperor's mother, Joanna.\r\nSome traces of it, however faint, may be discerned in his own conduct,\r\nbefore he took refuge in the cloisters of Yuste. And though we may not\r\nagree with Paul the Fourth in regarding this step as sufficient evidence\r\nof his madness,[332] we may yet find something in his conduct, on more\r\nthan one occasion, while there, which is near akin to it. Such, for\r\nexample, was the morbid relish which he discovered for performing the\r\nobsequies, not merely of his kindred, but of any one whose position\r\nseemed to him to furnish an apology for it. Not a member of the _toison_\r\ndied, but he was prepared to commemorate the event with solemn funeral\r\nrites. These, in short, seemed to be the festivities of Charles's\r\ncloister life. These lugubrious ceremonies had a fascination for him,\r\nthat may remind one of the tenacity with which his mother, Joanna, clung\r\nto the dead body of her husband, taking it with her wherever she went.\r\nIt was after celebrating the obsequies of his parents and his wife,\r\nwhich occupied several successive days, that he conceived, as we are\r\ntold, the idea of rehearsing his own funeral,--a piece of extravagance\r\nwhich becomes the more credible when we reflect on the state of morbid\r\nexcitement to which his mind may have been brought by dwelling so long\r\non the dreary apparatus of death.\r\n\r\nBut whatever be thought of the account of the mock funeral of Charles,\r\nit appears that on the thirtieth of August he was affected by an\r\nindisposition which on the following day was attended with most alarming\r\nsymptoms. Here also we have some particulars from his Jeronymite\r\nbiographers which we do not find in the letters. On the evening of the\r\nthirty-first, according to their account, Charles ordered a portrait of\r\nthe empress, his wife, of whom, as we have seen, he had more than one in\r\nhis collection, to be brought to him. He dwelt a long while on its\r\nbeautiful features, \"as if,\" says the chronicler, \"he were imploring her\r\nto prepare a place for him in the celestial mansions to which she had\r\ngone.\"[333] He then passed to the contemplation of another\r\npicture,--Titian's \"Agony in the Garden,\" and from this to that immortal\r\nproduction of his pencil, the \"Gloria,\" as it is called, which is said\r\nto have hung over the high altar at Yuste, and which, after the\r\nemperor's death, followed his remains to the Escorial.[334] He gazed so\r\nlong and with such rapt attention on the picture, as to cause\r\napprehension in his physician, who, in the emperor's debilitated state,\r\nfeared the effects of such excitement on his nerves. There was good\r\nreason for apprehension; for Charles, at length, rousing from his\r\nreverie, turned to the doctor, and complained that he was ill. His pulse\r\nshowed him to be in a high fever. As the symptoms became more\r\nunfavorable, his physician bled him, but without any good effect.[335]\r\nThe Regent Joanna, on learning her father's danger, instantly despatched\r\nher own physician from Valladolid to his assistance. But no earthly\r\nremedies could avail. It soon became evident that the end was\r\napproaching.[336]\r\n\r\nCharles received the intelligence, not merely with composure, but with\r\ncheerfulness. It was what he had long desired, he said. His first care\r\nwas to complete some few arrangements respecting his affairs. On the\r\nninth of September, he executed a codicil to his will. The will, made a\r\nfew years previous, was of great length, and the codicil had not the\r\nmerit of brevity. Its principal object was to make provision for those\r\nwho had followed him to Yuste. No mention is made in the codicil of his\r\nson Don John of Austria. He seems to have communicated his views in\r\nregard to him to his major-domo, Quixada, who had a private interview of\r\nsome length with his master a few days before his death. Charles's\r\ndirections on the subject appear to have been scrupulously regarded by\r\nPhilip.[337]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS LAST ILLNESS.]\r\n\r\nOne clause in the codicil deserves to be noticed. The emperor conjures\r\nhis son most earnestly, by the obedience he owes him, to follow up and\r\nbring to justice every heretic in his dominions; and this without\r\nexception, and without favor or mercy to any one. He conjures Philip to\r\ncherish the Holy Inquisition, as the best instrument for accomplishing\r\nthis good work. \"So,\" he concludes, \"shall you have my blessing, and the\r\nLord shall prosper all your undertakings.\"[338] Such were the last words\r\nof the dying monarch to his son. They did not fall on a deaf ear; and\r\nthe parting admonition of his father served to give a keener edge to the\r\nsword of persecution which Philip had already begun to wield.\r\n\r\nOn the nineteenth of September, Charles's strength had declined so much\r\nthat it was thought proper to administer extreme unction to him. He\r\npreferred to have it in the form adopted by the friars, which,\r\ncomprehending a litany, the seven penitential psalms, and sundry other\r\npassages of Scripture, was much longer and more exhausting than the rite\r\nused by the laity. His strength did not fail under it, however; and the\r\nfollowing day he desired to take the communion, as he had frequently\r\ndone during his illness. On his confessor's representing that, after the\r\nsacrament of extreme unction, this was unnecessary, he answered,\r\n\"Perhaps so, but it is good provision for the long journey I am to set\r\nout upon.\"[339] Exhausted as he was, he knelt a full quarter of an hour\r\nin his bed during the ceremony, offering thanks to God for his mercies,\r\nand expressing the deepest contrition for his sins, with an earnestness\r\nof manner that touched the hearts of all present.[340]\r\n\r\nThroughout his illness he had found consolation in having passages of\r\nScripture, especially the Psalms, read to him. Quixada, careful that his\r\nmaster should not be disquieted in his last moments, would allow very\r\nfew persons to be present in his chamber. Among the number was Bartolomé\r\nde Carranza, who had lately been raised to the archiepiscopal see of\r\nToledo. He had taken a prominent part in the persecution in England\r\nunder Mary. For the remainder of his life he was to be the victim of\r\npersecution himself, from a stronger arm than his, that of the\r\nInquisition. Even the words of consolation which he uttered in this\r\nchamber of death were carefully treasured up by Charles's confessor, and\r\nmade one of the charges against him in his impeachment for heresy.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-first of September, St. Matthew's day, about two hours\r\nafter midnight, the emperor, who had remained long without speaking,\r\nfeeling that his hour had come, exclaimed, \"Now it is time!\" The holy\r\ntaper was placed lighted in his right hand, as he sat up leaning on the\r\nshoulder of the faithful Quixada. With his left he endeavored to clasp a\r\nsilver crucifix. It had comforted the empress, his wife, in her dying\r\nhour; and Charles had ordered Quixada to hold it in readiness for him on\r\nthe like occasion.[341] It had lain for some time on his breast; and as\r\nit was now held up before his glazing eye by the archbishop of Toledo,\r\nCharles fixed his gaze long and earnestly on the sacred symbol,--to him\r\nthe memento of earthly love as well as heavenly. The archbishop was\r\nrepeating the psalm _De Profundis_,--\"Out of the depths have I cried\r\nunto thee, O Lord!\"--when the dying man, making a feeble effort to\r\nembrace the crucifix, exclaimed, in tones so audible as to be heard in\r\nthe adjoining room, \"_Ay Jesus!_\" and sinking back on the pillow,\r\nexpired without a struggle.[342] He had always prayed--perhaps fearing\r\nthe hereditary taint of insanity--that he might die in possession of\r\nhis faculties.[343] His prayer was granted.\r\n\r\nThe emperor's body, after being embalmed, and placed in its leaden\r\ncoffin, lay in state in the chapel for three days, during which three\r\ndiscourses were pronounced over it by the best preachers in the convent.\r\nIt was then consigned to the earth, with due solemnity, amidst the\r\nprayers and tears of the brethren and of Charles's domestics, in\r\npresence of a numerous concourse of persons from the surrounding\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe burial did not take place, however, without some difficulty. Charles\r\nhad requested by his will that he might be laid partially under the\r\ngreat altar, in such a manner that his head and the upper part of his\r\nbody might come under the spot where the priest stood when he performed\r\nthe service. This was dictated in all humility by the emperor; but it\r\nraised a question among the scrupulous ecclesiastics as to the propriety\r\nof permitting any bones save those of a saint to occupy so holy a place\r\nas that beneath the altar. The dispute waxed somewhat warmer than was\r\nsuited to the occasion; till the momentous affair was finally adjusted\r\nby having an excavation made in the wall, within which the head was\r\nintroduced, so as to allow the feet to touch the verge of the hallowed\r\nground.[344] The emperor's body did not long abide in its resting-place\r\nat Yuste. Before many years had elapsed, it was transported, by command\r\nof Philip the Second, to the Escorial, and in that magnificent mausoleum\r\nit has continued to repose, beside that of the Empress Isabella.\r\n\r\nThe funeral obsequies of Charles were celebrated with much pomp by the\r\ncourt of Rome, by the Regent Joanna at Valladolid, and, with yet greater\r\nmagnificence, by Philip the Second at Brussels. Philip was at Arras when\r\nhe learned the news of his father's death. He instantly repaired to a\r\nmonastery in the neighborhood of Brussels, where he remained secluded\r\nfor several weeks. Meanwhile he ordered the bells in all the churches\r\nand convents throughout the Netherlands to be tolled thrice a day for\r\nfour mouths, and during that time that no festivals or public rejoicings\r\nof any kind should take place. On the twenty-eighth of December the king\r\nentered Brussels by night, and on the following day, before the hour of\r\nvespers, a procession was formed to the church of St. Gudule, which\r\nstill challenges the admiration of the traveller as one of the noblest\r\nmonuments of mediæval architecture in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS DEATH AND CHARACTER.]\r\n\r\nThe procession consisted of the principal clergy, the members of the\r\ndifferent religious houses, bearing lighted tapers in their hands, the\r\nnobles and cavaliers about the court, the great officers of state and\r\nthe royal household, all clad in deep mourning. After these came the\r\nknights of the Golden Fleece, wearing the insignia and the superb dress\r\nof the order. The marquis of Aguilar bore the imperial sceptre, the\r\nduke of Villahermosa the sword, and the prince of Orange carried the\r\nglobe and the crown of the empire. Philip came on foot, wrapped in a\r\nsable mantle, with his head buried in a deep cowl. His train was borne\r\nby Ruy Gomez de Silva, the favorite minister. Then followed the duke of\r\nSavoy, walking also alone, with his head covered, as a prince of the\r\nblood. Files of the Spanish and German guard, in their national\r\nuniforms, formed an escort to the procession, as it took its way through\r\nthe principal streets, which were illumined with a blaze of torchlight,\r\nthat dispelled the gathering shadows of evening.\r\n\r\nA conspicuous part of the procession was a long train of horses led each\r\nby two gentlemen, and displaying on their splendid housings, and the\r\nbanners which they carried, the devices and arms of the several states\r\nover which the emperor presided.\r\n\r\nBut no part of the pageant attracted so much notice from the populace as\r\na stately galley, having its sides skilfully painted with battle-pieces\r\nsuggested by different actions in which Charles had been engaged; while\r\nits sails of black silk were covered with inscriptions in letters of\r\ngold, that commemorated the triumphs of the hero.\r\n\r\nAlthough the palace was at no great distance from St. Gudule's, the\r\nprocession occupied two hours in passing to the church. In the nave of\r\nthe edifice stood a sort of chapel, constructed for the occasion. Its\r\nroof, or rather canopy, displaying four crowns embroidered in gold,\r\nrested on four Ionic pillars curiously wrought. Within lay a sarcophagus\r\ncovered with a dark pall of velvet, surmounted by a large crimson cross.\r\nThe imperial crown, together with the globe and sceptre, was deposited\r\nin this chapel, which was lighted up with three thousand wax tapers.\r\n\r\nIn front of it was a scaffolding covered with black, on which a throne\r\nwas raised for Philip. The nobles and great officers of the crown\r\noccupied the seats, or rather steps, below. Drapery of dark velvet and\r\ncloth of gold, emblazoned with the imperial arms, was suspended across\r\nthe arches of the nave; above which ran galleries, appropriated to the\r\nduchess of Lorraine and the ladies of the court.[345]\r\n\r\nThe traveller who at this time visits this venerable pile, where Charles\r\nthe Fifth was wont to hold the chapters of the Golden Fleece, while he\r\ngazes on the characteristic effigy of that monarch, as it is displayed\r\non the superb windows of painted glass, may call to mind the memorable\r\nday when the people of Flanders, and the rank and beauty of its capital,\r\nwere gathered together to celebrate the obsequies of the great emperor;\r\nwhen, amidst clouds of incense and the blaze of myriads of lights, the\r\ndeep tones of the organ, vibrating through the long aisles, mingled with\r\nthe voices of the priests, as they chanted their sad requiem to the soul\r\nof their departed sovereign.[346]\r\n\r\nI have gone somewhat into detail in regard to the latter days of Charles\r\nthe Fifth, who exercised, in his retirement, too important an influence\r\non public affairs for such an account of him to be deemed an impertinent\r\nepisode to the history of Philip the Second. Before parting from him for\r\never, I will take a brief view of some peculiarities in his personal,\r\nrather than his political character, which has long since been indelibly\r\ntraced by a hand abler than mine.\r\n\r\nCharles, at the time of his death, was in the fifty-eighth year of his\r\nage. He was older in constitution than in years. So much shaken had he\r\nbeen, indeed, in mind as well as body, that he may be said to have died\r\nof premature old age. Yet his physical development had been very slow.\r\nHe was nearly twenty-one years old before any beard was to be seen on\r\nhis chin.[347] Yet by the time he was thirty-six, gray hairs began to\r\nmake their appearance on his temples. At forty the gout had made severe\r\ninroads on a constitution originally strong; and before he was fifty,\r\nthe man who could keep the saddle day and night in his campaigns, who\r\nseemed to be insensible to fatigue as he followed the chase among the\r\nwild passes of the Alpuxarras, was obliged to be carried in a litter,\r\nlike a poor cripple, at the head of his armies.[348]\r\n\r\nHis mental development was equally tardy with his bodily. So long as\r\nChievres lived,--the Flemish noble who had the care of his early\r\nlife,--Charles seemed to have no will of his own. During his first visit\r\nto Spain, where he came when seventeen years old, he gave so little\r\npromise, that those who approached him nearest could discern no signs of\r\nhis future greatness. Yet the young prince seems to have been conscious\r\nthat he had the elements of greatness within him, and he patiently bided\r\nhis time. \"_Nondum_\"--\"Not yet\"--was the motto which he adopted for his\r\nmaiden shield, when but eighteen years old, at a tournament at\r\nValladolid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS DEATH AND CHARACTER.]\r\n\r\nBut when the death of the Flemish minister had released the young\r\nmonarch from this state of dependence, he took the reins into his own\r\nhands, as Louis the Fourteenth did on the death of Mazarin. He now\r\nshowed himself in an entirely new aspect. He even displayed greater\r\nindependence than his predecessors had done. He no longer trusted\r\neverything, like them, to a council of state. He trusted only to\r\nhimself; and if he freely communicated with some one favorite minister,\r\nlike the elder Granvelle, and the cardinal, his son, it was in order to\r\nbe counselled, not to be controlled by their judgments. He patiently\r\ninformed himself of public affairs; and when foreign envoys had their\r\naudiences of him, they were surprised to find him possessed of\r\neverything relating to their own courts and the objects of their\r\nmission.\r\n\r\nYet he did not seem to be quick of apprehension, or, to speak more\r\ncorrectly, he was slow in arriving at his results. He would keep the\r\ncourier waiting for days before he could come to a decision. When he did\r\ncome to it, no person on earth could shake it. Talking one day with the\r\nVenetian Contarini about this habit of his mind, the courtly minister\r\nremarked, that \"it was not obstinacy to adhere to sound opinions.\"\r\n\"True,\" said Charles, \"but I sometimes adhere to those that are\r\nunsound.\"[349]\r\n\r\nHis indefatigable activity both of mind and body formed a strong\r\ncontrast to the lethargy of early years. His widely scattered empire,\r\nspreading over the Low Countries, Spain, Germany, and the New World,\r\npresented embarrassments which most princes would have found it\r\nimpossible to overcome. At least they would have been compelled to\r\ngovern, in a great measure, by deputy,--to transact their business by\r\nagents. But Charles chose to do everything himself,--to devise his own\r\nplans, and to execute them in person. The number of his journeys by land\r\nand by water, as noticed in his farewell address, is truly wonderful;\r\nfor that was not the day of steamboats and railways. He seemed to lead\r\nthe life of a courier. But it was for no trivial object that he made\r\nthese expeditions. He knew where his presence was needed; and his\r\npromptness and punctuality brought him, at the right time, on the right\r\nspot. No spot in his broad empire was far removed from him. He seemed to\r\npossess the power of ubiquity.\r\n\r\nThe consciousness of his own strength roused to a flame the spark of\r\nambition which had hitherto slept in his bosom. His schemes were so\r\nvast, that it was a common opinion he aspired to universal monarchy.\r\nLike his grandfather, Ferdinand, and his own son, Philip, he threw over\r\nhis schemes the cloak of religion. Or, to deal with him more fairly,\r\nreligious principle probably combined with personal policy to determine\r\nhis career. He seemed always ready to do battle for the Cross. He\r\naffected to identify the cause of Spain with the cause of Christendom.\r\nHe marched against the Turks, and stayed the tide of Ottoman inroad in\r\nHungary. He marched against the Protestants, and discomfited their\r\narmies in the heart of Germany. He crossed the Mediterranean, and\r\nhumbled the Crescent at Algiers. He threw himself on the honor of\r\nFrancis, and travelled through France to take vengeance on the rebels of\r\nFlanders. He twice entered France as an enemy, and marched up to the\r\ngates of Paris. Instead of the modest legend on his maiden shield; he\r\nnow assumed the proud motto, \"_Plus ultra_;\" and he vindicated his right\r\nto it, by sending his fleets across the ocean, and by planting the\r\nbanner of Castile on the distant shores of the Pacific. In these\r\nenterprises he was generally successful. His success led him to rely\r\nstill more on himself. \"Myself and the lucky moment,\" was his favorite\r\nsaying. The \"star of Austria,\" was still a proverb. It was not till the\r\nevening of life that he complained of the fickleness of fortune; that\r\nhis star, as it descended to the horizon, was obscured by clouds and\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThus Charles's nerves were kept in a state of perpetual excitement. No\r\nwonder that his health should have sunk under it; like a plant forced by\r\nextraordinary stimulants to an unnatural production at the expense of\r\nits own vitality.\r\n\r\nHis habits were not all of them the most conducive to health. He slept\r\nusually only four hours; too short a time to repair the waste caused by\r\nincessant toil.[350] His phlegmatic temperament did not incline him to\r\nexcess. Yet there was one excess of which he was guilty,--the indulgence\r\nof his appetite to a degree most pernicious to his health. A Venetian\r\ncontemporary tells us, that, before rising in the morning, potted capon\r\nwas usually served to him, dressed with sugar, milk, and spices. At noon\r\nhe dined on a variety of dishes. Soon after vespers he took another\r\nmeal; and later in the evening supped heartily on anchovies, or some\r\nother gross and savory food of which he was particularly fond.[351] On\r\none occasion, complaining to his _maître d'hôtel_ that the cook sent him\r\nnothing but dishes too insipid and tasteless to be eaten, the perplexed\r\nfunctionary, knowing Charles's passion for timepieces, replied, that \"he\r\ndid not know what he could do, unless it were to serve his majesty a\r\nragout of watches!\" The witticism had one good effect, that of provoking\r\na hearty laugh from the emperor,--a thing rarely witnessed in his latter\r\ndays.[352]\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that Cardinal Loaysa, his confessor, remonstrated, with\r\nan independence that does him credit, against his master's indulgence of\r\nhis appetite, assuring him that resistance here would do more for his\r\nsoul than any penance with the scourge.[353] It seems a pity that\r\nCharles, considering his propensities, should have so easily obtained\r\nabsolution from fasts, and that he should not, on the contrary, have\r\ntransferred some of the penance which he inflicted on his back to the\r\noffending part. Even in the monastery of Yuste he still persevered in\r\nthe same pernicious taste. Anchovies, frogs' legs, and eel-pasties were\r\nthe dainty morsels with which he chose to be regaled, even before the\r\neyes of his physician. It would not have been amiss for him to have\r\nexchanged his solitary repast more frequently for the simpler fare of\r\nthe refectory.\r\n\r\nWith these coarser tastes Charles combined many others of a refined and\r\nintellectual character. We have seen his fondness for music, and the\r\ndelight he took in the sister art of design,--especially in the works of\r\nTitian. He was painted several times by this great master, and it was by\r\nhis hand, as we have seen, that he desired to go down to posterity. The\r\nemperor had, moreover, another taste, perhaps talent, which, with a\r\ndifferent training and in a different sphere of life, might have led him\r\nto the craft of authorship.\r\n\r\nA curious conversation is reported as having been held by him with\r\nBorja, the future saint, during one of the visits paid by the Jesuit to\r\nYuste. Charles inquired of his friend whether it were wrong for a man to\r\nwrite his autobiography, provided he did so honestly, and with no motive\r\nof vanity. He said that he had written his own memoirs, not from the\r\ndesire of self-glorification, but to correct manifold mistakes which had\r\nbeen circulated of his doings, and to set his conduct in a true\r\nlight.[354] One might be curious to know the answer, which is not given,\r\nof the good father to this question. It is to be hoped that it was not\r\nof a kind to induce the emperor to destroy the manuscript, which has\r\nnever come to light.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, there is no reason to doubt that at one period of\r\nhis life he had compiled a portion of his autobiography. In the imperial\r\nhousehold, as I have already noticed, was a Flemish scholar, William Van\r\nMale, or Malinæus, as he is called in Latin, who, under the title of\r\ngentleman of the chamber, wrote many a long letter for Charles, while\r\nstanding by his bedside, and read many a weary hour to him after the\r\nmonarch had gone to rest,--not, as it would seem, to sleep.[355] This\r\npersonage tells us that Charles, when sailing on the Rhine, wrote an\r\naccount of his expeditions to as late a date as 1550.[356] This is not\r\nvery definite. Any account written under such circumstances, and in so\r\nshort a time, could be nothing but a sketch of the most general kind.\r\nYet Van Male assures us that he had read the manuscript, which he\r\ncommends for its terse and elegant diction; and he proposes to make a\r\nLatin version of it, the style of which should combine the separate\r\nmerits of Tacitus, Livy, Suetonius, and Cæsar![357] The admiring\r\nchamberlain laments that, instead of giving it to the world, Charles\r\nshould keep it jealously secured under lock and key.[358]\r\n\r\nThe emperor's taste for authorship showed itself also in another form.\r\nThis was by the translation of the \"_Chevalier Délibéré_,\" a French poem\r\nthen popular, celebrating the court of his ancestor, Charles the Bold of\r\nBurgundy. Van Male, who seems to have done for Charles the Fifth what\r\nVoltaire did for Frederick, when he spoke of himself as washing the\r\nking's dirty linen, was employed also to overlook this translation,\r\nwhich he pronounces to have possessed great merit in regard to idiom and\r\nselection of language. The emperor then gave it to Acuña, a good poet of\r\nthe court, to be done into Castilian verse. Thus metamorphosed, he\r\nproposed to give the copy to Van Male. A mischievous wag, Avila the\r\nhistorian, assured the emperor that it could not be worth less than five\r\nhundred gold crowns to that functionary. \"And William is well entitled\r\nto them,\" said the monarch, \"for he has sweat much over the work.\"[359]\r\nTwo thousand copies were forthwith ordered to be printed of the poem,\r\nwhich was to come out anonymously. Poor Van Male, who took a very\r\ndifferent view of the profits, and thought that nothing was certain but\r\nthe cost of the edition, would have excused himself from this proof of\r\nhis master's liberality. It was all in vain; Charles was not to be\r\nbalked in his generous purpose; and, without a line to propitiate the\r\npublic favor, by stating in the preface the share of the royal hand in\r\nthe composition, it was ushered into the world.[360]\r\n\r\nWhatever Charles may have done in the way of an autobiography, he was\r\ncertainly not indifferent to posthumous fame. He knew that the greatest\r\nname must soon pass into oblivion, unless embalmed in the song of the\r\nbard or the page of the chronicler. He looked for a chronicler to do for\r\nhim with his pen what Titian had done for him with his pencil,--exhibit\r\nhim in his true proportions, and in a permanent form, to the eye of\r\nposterity! In this he does not seem to have been so much under the\r\ninfluence of vanity as of a natural desire to have his character and\r\nconduct placed in a fair point of view,--what seemed to him to be\r\nsuch,--for the contemplation or criticism of mankind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS DEATH AND CHARACTER.]\r\n\r\nThe person whom the emperor selected for this delicate office was the\r\nlearned Sepulveda. Sleidan he condemned as a slanderer; and Giovio, who\r\nhad taken the other extreme, and written of him with what he called the\r\n\"golden pen\" of history, he no less condemned as a flatterer.[361]\r\nCharles encouraged Sepulveda to apply to him for information on matters\r\nrelating to his government. But when requested by the historian to\r\nlisten to what he had written, the emperor refused. \"I will neither\r\nhear nor read,\" he replied, \"what you have said of me. Others may do\r\nthis when I am gone. But if you wish for information on any point, I\r\nshall be always ready to give it to you.\"[362] A history thus compiled\r\nwas of the nature of an autobiography, and must be considered,\r\ntherefore, as entitled to much the same confidence, and open to the same\r\nobjections, as that kind of writing. Sepulveda was one of the few who\r\nhad repeated access to Charles in his retirement at Yuste;[363] and the\r\nmonarch testified his regard for him, by directing that particular care\r\nbe taken that no harm should come to the historian's manuscript before\r\nit was committed to the press.[364]\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the most interesting traits and personal anecdotes I\r\nhave been able to collect of the man who, for nearly forty years, ruled\r\nover an empire more vast, with an authority more absolute, than any\r\nmonarch since the days of Charlemagne. It may be thought strange that I\r\nshould have omitted to notice one feature in his character, the most\r\nprominent in the line from which he was descended, at least on the\r\nmother's side,--his bigotry. But in Charles this was less conspicuous\r\nthan in many others of his house; and while he sat upon the throne, the\r\nextent to which his religious principles were held in subordination by\r\nhis political, suggests a much closer parallel to the policy of his\r\ngrandfather, Ferdinand the Catholic, than to that of his son, Philip the\r\nSecond, or of his imbecile grandson, Philip the Third.\r\n\r\nBut the religious gloom which hung over Charles's mind took the deeper\r\ntinge of fanaticism after he had withdrawn to the monastery of Yuste.\r\nWith his dying words, as we have seen, he bequeathed the Inquisition as\r\na precious legacy to his son. In like manner, he endeavored to cherish\r\nin the Regent Joanna's bosom the spirit of persecution.[365] And if it\r\nwere true, as his biographer assures us, that Charles expressed a regret\r\nthat he had respected the safe-conduct of Luther,[366] the world had\r\nlittle reason to mourn that he exchanged the sword and the sceptre for\r\nthe breviary of the friar,--the throne of the Cæsars for his monastic\r\nretreat among the wilds of Estremadura.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe preceding chapter was written in the summer of 1851, a year before\r\nthe appearance of Stirling's \"Cloister Life of Charles the Fifth,\" which\r\nled the way in that brilliant series of works from the pens of Amédée\r\nPichot, Mignet, and Gachard, which has made the darkest recesses of\r\nYuste as light as day. The publication of these works has deprived my\r\naccount of whatever novelty it might have possessed, since it rests on a\r\nsimilar basis with theirs, namely, original documents in the Archives of\r\nSimancas. Yet the important influence which Charles exerted over the\r\nmanagement of affairs, even in his monastic retreat, has made it\r\nimpossible to dispense with the chapter. On the contrary, I have\r\nprofited by these recent publications to make sundry additions, which\r\nmay readily be discovered by the reader, from the references I have been\r\ncareful to make to the sources whence they are derived.\r\n\r\nThe public has been hitherto indebted for its knowledge of the reign of\r\nCharles the Fifth to Robertson,--a writer who, combining a truly\r\nphilosophical spirit with an acute perception of character, is\r\nrecommended, moreover, by a classic elegance of style which has justly\r\ngiven him a preëminence among the historians of the great emperor. But\r\nin his account of the latter days of Charles, Robertson mainly relies on\r\ncommonplace authorities, whose information, gathered at second hand, is\r\nfar from being trustworthy,--as is proved by the contradictory tenor of\r\nsuch authentic documents as the letters of Charles himself, with those\r\nof his own followers, and the narratives of the brotherhood of Yuste.\r\nThese documents are, for the most part, to be found in the Archives of\r\nSimancas, where, in Robertson's time, they were guarded, with the\r\nvigilance of a Turkish harem, against all intrusion of native as well as\r\nforeigner. It was not until very recently, in 1844, that the more\r\nliberal disposition of the government allowed the gates to be unbarred\r\nwhich had been closed for centuries; and then, for the first time, the\r\nstudent might be seen toiling in the dusty alcoves of Simancas, and\r\nbusily exploring the long-buried memorials of the past. It was at this\r\nperiod that my friend, Don Pascual de Gayangos, having obtained\r\nauthority from the government, passed some weeks at Simancas in\r\ncollecting materials, some of which have formed the groundwork of the\r\npreceding chapter.\r\n\r\nWhile the manuscripts of Simancas were thus hidden from the world, a\r\nlearned keeper of the archives, Don Tomas Gonzalez, discontented with\r\nthe unworthy view which had been given of the latter days of Charles the\r\nFifth, had profited by the materials which lay around him, to exhibit\r\nhis life at Yuste in a new and more authentic light. To the volume which\r\nhe compiled for this purpose he gave the title of \"_Retiro, Estancia, y\r\nMuerte del Emperador Carlos Quinto en el Monasterio de Yuste_.\" The\r\nwork, the principal value of which consists in the copious extracts with\r\nwhich it is furnished from the correspondence of Charles and his\r\nhousehold, was suffered by the author to remain in manuscript; and, at\r\nhis death, it passed into the hands of his brother, who prepared a\r\nsummary of its contents, and endeavored to dispose of the volume at a\r\nprice so exorbitant that it remained for many years without a purchaser.\r\nIt was finally bought by the French government at a greatly reduced\r\nprice,--for four thousand francs. It may seem strange that it should\r\nhave even brought this sum, since the time of the sale was that in which\r\nthe new arrangements were made for giving admission to the archives that\r\ncontained the original documents on which the Gonzalez MS. was founded.\r\nThe work thus bought by the French government was transferred to the\r\nArchives des Affaires Etrangères, then under the direction of M. Mignet.\r\nThe manuscript could not be in better hands than those of a scholar who\r\nhas so successfully carried the torch of criticism into some of the\r\ndarkest passages of Spanish history. His occupations, however, took him\r\nin another direction; and for eight years the Gonzalez MS. remained as\r\ncompletely hidden from the world in the Parisian archives as it had been\r\nin those of Simancas. When, at length, it was applied to the historical\r\nuses for which it had been intended, it was through the agency, not of a\r\nFrench, but of a British writer. This was Mr. Stirling, the author of\r\nthe \"Annals of the Artists of Spain,\"--a work honorable to its author\r\nfor the familiarity it shows, not only with the state of the arts in\r\nthat country, but also with its literature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MEMOIRS OF CHARLES.]\r\n\r\nMr. Stirling, during a visit to the Peninsula, in 1849, made a\r\npilgrimage to Yuste; and the traditions and hoary reminiscences gathered\r\nround the spot left such an impression on the traveller's mind, that, on\r\nhis return to England, he made them the subject of two elaborate papers\r\nin Fraser's Magazine, in the numbers for April and May, 1851. Although\r\nthese spirited essays rested wholly on printed works, which had long\r\nbeen accessible to the scholar, they were found to contain many new and\r\nhighly interesting details; showing how superficially Mr.\r\n\r\nStirling's predecessors had examined the records of the emperor's\r\nresidence at Yuste. Still, in his account the author had omitted the\r\nmost important feature of Charles's monastic life,--the influence which\r\nhe exercised on the administration of the kingdom. This was to be\r\ngathered from the manuscripts of Simancas.\r\n\r\nMr. Stirling, who through that inexhaustible repository, the Handbook of\r\nSpain, had become acquainted with the existence of the Gonzalez MS.,\r\nwas, at the time of writing his essays, ignorant of its fate. On\r\nlearning, afterwards, where it was to be found, he visited Paris, and,\r\nhaving obtained access to the volume, so far profited by its contents as\r\nto make them the basis of a separate work, which he entitled \"The\r\nCloister Life of Charles the Fifth.\" It soon attracted the attention of\r\nscholars, both at home and abroad, went through several editions, and\r\nwas received, in short, with an avidity which showed both the importance\r\nattached to the developments the author had made, and the highly\r\nattractive form in which he had presented them to the reader.\r\n\r\nThe Parisian scholars were now stimulated to turn to account the\r\ntreasure which had remained so long neglected on their shelves. In 1854,\r\nless than two years after the appearance of Mr. Stirling's book, M.\r\nAmédée Pichot published his \"_Chronique de Charles-Quint_,\" a work\r\nwhich, far from being confined to the latter days of the emperor, covers\r\nthe whole range of his biography, presenting a large amount of\r\ninformation in regard to his personal habits, as well as to the interior\r\norganization of his government, and the policy which directed it. The\r\nwhole is enriched, moreover, by a multitude of historical incidents,\r\nwhich may be regarded rather as subsidiary than essential to the conduct\r\nof the narrative, which is enlivened by much ingenious criticism on the\r\nstate of manners, arts, and moral culture of the period.\r\n\r\nIt was not long after the appearance of this work that M. Gachard, whom\r\nI have elsewhere noticed as having been commissioned by the Belgian\r\ngovernment to make extensive researches in the Archives of Simancas,\r\ngave to the public some of the fruits of his labors, in the first volume\r\nof his \"_Retraite et Mort de Charles-Quint_.\" It is devoted to the\r\nletters of the emperor and his household, which form the staple of the\r\nGonzalez MS.; thus placing at the disposition of the future biographer\r\nof Charles the original materials with which to reconstruct the history\r\nof his latter days.\r\n\r\nLastly came the work, long expected, of M. Mignet, \"_Charles-Quint; son\r\nAbdication, son Séjour, et sa Mort au Monastère de Yuste_.\" It was the\r\nreproduction, in a more extended and elaborate form, of a series of\r\npapers, the first of which appeared shortly after the publication of Mr.\r\nStirling's book. In this work the French author takes the clear and\r\ncomprehensive view of his subject so characteristic of his genius. The\r\ndifficult and debatable points he discusses with acuteness and\r\nprecision; and the whole story of Charles's monastic life he presents in\r\nso luminous an aspect to the reader as leaves nothing further to be\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nThe critic may take some interest in comparing the different manners in\r\nwhich the several writers have dealt with the subject, each according to\r\nhis own taste, or the bent of his genius. Thus through Stirling's more\r\nfree and familiar narrative there runs a pleasant vein of humor, with\r\npiquancy enough to give it relish, showing the author's sensibility to\r\nthe ludicrous, for which Charles's stingy habits, and excessive love of\r\ngood cheer, even in the convent, furnish frequent occasion.\r\n\r\nQuite a different conception is formed by Mignet of the emperor's\r\ncharacter, which he has cast in the true heroic mould, not deigning to\r\nrecognize a single defect, however slight, which may at all impair the\r\nmajesty of the proportions. Finally, Amédée Pichot, instead of the\r\nclassical, may be said to have conformed to the romantic school in the\r\narrangement of his subject, indulging in various picturesque episodes,\r\nwhich he has, however, combined so successfully with the main body of\r\nthe narrative as not to impair the unity of interest.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be thought of the comparative merits of these eminent\r\nwriters in the execution of their task, the effect of their labors has\r\nundoubtedly been to make that the plainest which was before the most\r\nobscure portion of the history of Charles the Fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nVIEW OF THE NETHERLANDS.\r\n\r\nCivil Institutions.--Commercial Prosperity.--Character of the\r\nPeople.--Protestant Doctrines.--Persecution by Charles the Fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now come to that portion of the narrative which seems to be\r\nrather in the nature of an episode, than part and parcel of our history;\r\nthough from its magnitude and importance it is better entitled to be\r\ntreated as an independent history by itself. This is the War of the\r\nNetherlands; opening the way to that great series of revolutions, the\r\nmost splendid example of which is furnished by our own happy land.\r\nBefore entering on this vast theme, it will be well to give a brief view\r\nof the country which forms the subject of it.\r\n\r\nAt the accession of Philip the Second, about the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, the Netherlands, or Flanders, as the country was then usually\r\ncalled,[367] comprehended seventeen provinces, occupying much the same\r\nterritory, but somewhat abridged, with that included in the present\r\nkingdoms of Holland and Belgium.[368] These provinces, under the various\r\ndenominations of duchies, counties, and lordships, formed anciently so\r\nmany separate states, each under the rule of its respective prince. Even\r\nwhen two or three of them, as sometimes happened, were brought together\r\nunder one sceptre, each still maintained its own independent existence.\r\nIn their institutions these states bore great resemblance to one\r\nanother, and especially in the extent of the immunities conceded to the\r\ncitizens as compared with those enjoyed in most of the countries of\r\nChristendom. No tax could be imposed, without the consent of an assembly\r\nconsisting of the clergy, the nobles, and the representatives of the\r\ntowns. No foreigner was eligible to office, and the native of one\r\nprovince was regarded as a foreigner by every other. These were insisted\r\non as inalienable rights, although in later times none were more\r\nfrequently disregarded by the rulers.[369]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THEIR CIVIL INSTITUTIONS.]\r\n\r\nThe condition of the commons in the Netherlands, during the Middle Ages,\r\nwas far in advance of what it was in most other European countries at\r\nthe same period. For this they were indebted to the character of the\r\npeople, or rather to the peculiar circumstances which formed that\r\ncharacter. Occupying a soil which had been redeemed with infinite toil\r\nand perseverance from the waters, their life was passed in perpetual\r\nstruggle with the elements. They were early familiarized to the dangers\r\nof the ocean. The Flemish mariner was distinguished for the intrepid\r\nspirit with which he pushed his voyages into distant and unknown seas.\r\nAn extended commerce opened to him a wide range of observation and\r\nexperience; and to the bold and hardy character of the ancient\r\nNetherlander was added a spirit of enterprise, with such enlarged and\r\nliberal views as fitted him for taking part in the great concerns of the\r\ncommunity. Villages and towns grew up rapidly. Wealth flowed in from\r\nthis commercial activity, and the assistance which these little\r\ncommunities were thus enabled to afford their princes drew from the\r\nlatter the concession of important political privileges, which\r\nestablished the independence of the citizen.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of things, however, was still to maintain the distinct\r\nindividuality of the provinces, rather than to unite them into a common\r\npolitical body. They were peopled by different races, speaking different\r\nlanguages. In some of the provinces French was spoken, in others a\r\ndialect of the German. Their position, moreover, had often brought these\r\npetty states into rivalry, and sometimes into open war, with one\r\nanother. The effects of these feuds continued after the causes of them\r\nhad passed away; and mutual animosities still lingered in the breasts of\r\nthe inhabitants, operating as a permanent source of disunion.\r\n\r\nFrom these causes, after the greater part of the provinces had been\r\nbrought together under the sceptre of the ducal house of Burgundy, in\r\nthe fifteenth century, it was found impossible to fuse them into one\r\nnation. Even Charles the Fifth, with all his power and personal\r\ninfluence, found himself unequal to the task.[370] He was obliged to\r\nrelinquish the idea of consolidating the different states into one\r\nmonarchy, and to content himself with the position--not too grateful to\r\na Spanish despot--of head of a republic, or, to speak more properly, of\r\na confederacy of republics.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, some approach made to a national unity in the\r\ninstitution which grew up after the states were brought together under\r\none sceptre. Thus, while each of the provinces maintained its own courts\r\nof justice, there was a supreme tribunal established at Mechlin, with\r\nappellate jurisdiction over all the provincial tribunals. In like\r\nmanner, while each state had its own legislative assembly, there were\r\nthe states-general, consisting of the clergy, the nobles, and the\r\nrepresentatives of the towns, from each of the provinces. In this\r\nassembly--but rarely convened--were discussed the great questions having\r\nreference to the interests of the whole country. But the assembly was\r\nvested with no legislative authority. It could go no further than to\r\npresent petitions to the sovereign for the redress of grievances. It\r\npossessed no right beyond the right of remonstrance. Even in questions\r\nof taxation, no subsidy could be settled in that body, without the\r\nexpress sanction of each of the provincial legislatures. Such a form of\r\ngovernment, it must be admitted, was altogether too cumbrous in its\r\noperations for efficient executive movement. It was by means favorable\r\nto the promptness and energy demanded for military enterprise. But it\r\nwas a government which, however ill-suited in this respect to the temper\r\nof Charles the Fifth, was well suited to the genius of the inhabitants,\r\nand to their circumstances, which demanded peace. They had no ambition\r\nfor foreign conquest. By the arts of peace they had risen to this\r\nunprecedented pitch of prosperity, and by peace alone, not by war, could\r\nthey hope to maintain it.\r\n\r\nBut under the long rule of the Burgundian princes, and still more under\r\nthat of Charles the Fifth, the people of the Netherlands felt the\r\ninfluence of those circumstances which in other parts of Europe were\r\ngradually compelling the popular, or rather the feudal element, to give\r\nway to the spirit of centralization. Thus in time the sovereign claimed\r\nthe right of nominating all the higher clergy. In some instances he\r\nappointed the judges of the provincial courts; and the supreme tribunal\r\nof Mechlin was so far dependent on his authority, that all the judges\r\nwere named and their salaries paid by the crown. The sovereign's\r\nauthority was even stretched so far as to interfere not unfrequently\r\nwith the rights exercised by the citizens in the election of their own\r\nmagistrates,--rights that should have been cherished by them as of the\r\nlast importance. As for the nobles, we cannot over-estimate the\r\nascendancy which the master of an empire like that of Charles the Fifth\r\nmust have obtained over men to whom he could open such boundless\r\nprospects in the career of ambition.[371]\r\n\r\nBut the personal character and the peculiar position of Charles tended\r\nstill further to enlarge the royal authority. He was a Fleming by birth.\r\nHe had all the tastes and habits of a Fleming. His early days had been\r\npassed in Flanders, and he loved to return to his native land as often\r\nas his busy life would permit him, and to seek in the free and joyous\r\nsociety of the Flemish capitals some relief from the solemn ceremonial\r\nof the Castilian court. This preference of their lord was repaid by the\r\npeople of the Netherlands with feelings of loyal devotion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THEIR COMMERCIAL PROSPERITY.]\r\n\r\nBut they had reason for feelings of deeper gratitude in the substantial\r\nbenefits which the favor of Charles secured to them. It was for Flemings\r\nthat the highest posts even in Spain were reserved, and the marked\r\npreference thus shown by the emperor to his countrymen was one great\r\nsource of the troubles in Castile. The soldiers of the Netherlands\r\naccompanied Charles on his military expeditions, and their cavalry had\r\nthe reputation of being the best appointed and best disciplined in the\r\nimperial army. The vast extent of his possessions, spreading over every\r\nquarter of the globe, offered a boundless range for the commerce of the\r\nNetherlands, which was everywhere admitted on the most favorable\r\nfooting. Notwithstanding his occasional acts of violence and extortion,\r\nCharles was too sagacious not to foster the material interests of a\r\ncountry which contributed so essentially to his own resources. Under his\r\nprotecting policy, the industry and ingenuity of the Flemings found\r\nample scope in the various departments of husbandry, manufactures, and\r\ntrade. The country was as thickly studded with large towns as other\r\ncountries were with villages. In the middle of the sixteenth century it\r\nwas computed to contain above three hundred and fifty cities, and more\r\nthan six thousand three hundred towns of a smaller size.[372] These\r\ntowns were not the resort of monks and mendicants, as in other parts of\r\nthe Continent, but they swarmed with a busy, laborious population. No\r\nman ate the bread of idleness in the Netherlands. At the period with\r\nwhich we are occupied Ghent counted 70,000 inhabitants, Brussels 75,000,\r\nand Antwerp 100,000. This was at a period when London itself contained\r\nbut 150,000.[373]\r\n\r\nThe country, fertilized by its countless canals and sluices, exhibited\r\neverywhere that minute and patient cultivation which distinguishes it at\r\nthe present day, but which in the middle of the sixteenth century had no\r\nparallel but in the lands tilled by the Moorish inhabitants of the south\r\nof Spain. The ingenious spirit of the people was shown in their\r\ndexterity in the mechanical arts, and in the talent for invention which\r\nseems to be characteristic of a people accustomed from infancy to the\r\nunfettered exercise of their faculties. The processes for simplifying\r\nlabor were carried so far, that children, as we are assured, began, at\r\nfour or five years of age, to earn a livelihood.[374] Each of the\r\nprincipal cities became noted for its excellence in some branch or other\r\nof manufacture. Lille was known for its woollen cloths, Brussels for its\r\ntapestry and carpets, Valenciennes for its camlets, while the towns of\r\nHolland and Zealand furnished a simpler staple in the form of cheese,\r\nbutter, and salted fish.[375] These various commodities were exhibited\r\nat the great fairs held twice a year, for the space of twenty days each,\r\nat Antwerp, which were thronged by foreigners as well as natives.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the Flemings imported great\r\nquantities of wool from England, to be manufactured into cloth at home.\r\nBut Flemish emigrants had carried that manufacture to England; and in\r\nthe time of Philip the Second the cloths themselves were imported from\r\nthe latter country to the amount of above five millions of crowns\r\nannually, and exchanged for the domestic products of the\r\nNetherlands.[376] This single item of trade with one of their neighbors\r\nmay suggest some notion of the extent of the commerce of the Low\r\nCountries at this period.\r\n\r\nBut in truth the commerce of the country stretched to the remotest\r\ncorners of the globe. The inhabitants of the Netherlands, trained from\r\nearly youth to battle with the waves, found their true element on the\r\nocean. \"As much as Nature,\" says an enthusiastic writer, \"restricted\r\ntheir domain on the land, so much the more did they extend their empire\r\non the deep.\"[377] Their fleets were to be found on every sea. In the\r\nEuxine and in the Mediterranean they were rivals of the Venetian and the\r\nGenoese, and they contended with the English, and even with the\r\nSpaniards, for superiority on the \"narrow seas\" and the great ocean.\r\n\r\nThe wealth which flowed into the country from this extended trade was\r\nsoon shown in the crowded population of its provinces and the splendor\r\nof their capitals. At the head of these stood the city of Antwerp, which\r\noccupied the place in the sixteenth century that Bruges had occupied in\r\nthe fifteenth, as the commercial metropolis of the Netherlands. Two\r\nhundred and fifty vessels might often be seen at the same time taking in\r\ntheir cargoes at her quays.[378] Two thousand loaded wagons from the\r\nneighboring countries of France, Germany, and Lorraine daily passed\r\nthrough her gates;[379] and a greater number of vessels, freighted with\r\nmerchandise from different quarters of the world, were to be seen\r\nfloating at the same time on the waters of the Scheldt.[380]\r\n\r\nThe city, in common with the rest of Brabant, was distinguished by\r\ncertain political privileges, which commended it as a place of residence\r\neven to foreigners. Women of the other provinces, it is said, when the\r\ntime of their confinement drew near, would come to Brabant, that their\r\noffspring might claim the franchises of this favored portion of the\r\nNetherlands.[381] So jealous were the people of this province of their\r\nliberties, that in their oath of allegiance to their sovereign, on his\r\naccession, it was provided that this allegiance might lawfully be\r\nwithheld whenever he ceased to respect their privileges.[382]\r\n\r\nUnder the shelter of its municipal rights, foreigners settled in great\r\nnumbers in Antwerp. The English established a factory there. There was\r\nalso a Portuguese company, an Italian company, a company of merchants\r\nfrom the Hanse Towns, and, lastly, a Turkish company, which took up its\r\nresidence there for the purpose of pursuing a trade with the Levant. A\r\ngreat traffic was carried on in bills of exchange. Antwerp, in short,\r\nbecame the banking-house of Europe; and capitalists, the Rothschilds of\r\ntheir day, whose dealings were with sovereign princes, fixed their abode\r\nin Antwerp, which was to the rest of Europe in the sixteenth century\r\nwhat London is in the nineteenth,--the great heart of commercial\r\ncirculation.[383]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PROTESTANT DOCTRINES]\r\n\r\nIn 1531, the public Exchange was erected, the finest building of its\r\nkind at that time anywhere to be seen. The city, indeed, was filled with\r\nstately edifices, the largest of which, the great cathedral, having been\r\nnearly destroyed by fire, soon after the opening of the Exchange, was\r\nrebuilt, and still remains a noble specimen of the architectural\r\nscience of the time. Another age was to see the walls of the same\r\ncathedral adorned with those exquisite productions of Rubens and his\r\ndisciples, which raised the Flemish school to a level with the great\r\nItalian masters.\r\n\r\nThe rapidly increasing opulence of the city was visible in the luxurious\r\naccommodations and sumptuous way of living of the inhabitants. The\r\nmerchants of Antwerp rivalled the nobles of other lands in the splendor\r\nof their dress and domestic establishments. Something of the same sort\r\nshowed itself in the middle classes; and even in those of humbler\r\ncondition, there was a comfort approaching to luxury in their\r\nhouseholds, which attracted the notice of an Italian writer of the\r\nsixteenth century. He commends the scrupulous regard to order and\r\ncleanliness observed in the arrangement of the dwellings, and expresses\r\nhis admiration, not only of the careful attention given by the women to\r\ntheir domestic duties, but also of their singular capacity for\r\nconducting those business affairs usually reserved for the other sex.\r\nThis was particularly the case in Holland.[384] But this freedom of\r\nintercourse was no disparagement to their feminine qualities. The\r\nliberty they assumed did not degenerate into licence; and he concludes\r\nhis animated portraiture of these Flemish matrons by pronouncing them as\r\ndiscreet as they were beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe humbler classes, in so abject a condition in other parts of Europe\r\nat that day, felt the good effects of this general progress in comfort\r\nand civilization. It was rare to find one, we are told, so illiterate as\r\nnot to be acquainted with the rudiments of grammar; and there was\r\nscarcely a peasant who could not both read and write;[385]--this at a\r\ntime when to read and write were accomplishments not always possessed,\r\nin other countries, by those even in the higher walks of life.\r\n\r\nIt was not possible that a people so well advanced in the elements of\r\ncivilization should long remain insensible to the great religious reform\r\nwhich, having risen on their borders, was now rapidly spreading over\r\nChristendom. Besides the contiguity of the Netherlands to Germany, their\r\ncommerce with other countries had introduced them to Protestantism as it\r\nexisted there. The foreign residents, and the Swiss and German\r\nmercenaries quartered in the provinces, had imported along with them\r\nthese same principles of the Reformation; and lastly the Flemish nobles,\r\nwho, at that time, were much in the fashion of going abroad to study in\r\nGeneva, returned from that stronghold of Calvin well fortified with the\r\ndoctrines of the great Reformer.[386] Thus the seeds of the Reformation,\r\nwhether in the Lutheran or the Calvinistic form, were scattered wide\r\nover the land, and took root in a congenial soil. The phlegmatic\r\ntemperament of the northern provinces, especially, disposed them to\r\nreceive a religion which addressed itself so exclusively to the reason,\r\nwhile they were less open to the influences of Catholicism, which, with\r\nits gorgeous accessories, appealing to the passions, is better suited to\r\nthe lively sensibilities and kindling imaginations of the south.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that Charles the Fifth could long remain\r\ninsensible to this alarming defection of his subjects in the\r\nNetherlands; nor that the man whose life was passed in battling with the\r\nLutherans of Germany could patiently submit to see their detested heresy\r\ntaking root in his own dominions. He dreaded this innovation no less in\r\na temporal than in a spiritual view. Experience had shown that freedom\r\nof speculation in affairs of religion naturally led to free inquiry into\r\npolitical abuses; that the work of the reformer was never accomplished\r\nso long as anything remained to reform, in state as well as in church.\r\nCharles, with the instinct of Spanish despotism, sought a remedy in one\r\nof those acts of arbitrary power in which he indulged without scruple\r\nwhen the occasion called for them.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1520, he published the first of his barbarous edicts for the\r\nsuppression of the new faith. It was followed by several others of the\r\nsame tenor, repeated at intervals throughout his reign. The last\r\nappeared in September, 1550.[387] As this in a manner suspended those\r\nthat had preceded it, to which, however, it substantially conformed, and\r\nas it became the basis of Philip's subsequent legislation, it will be\r\nwell to recite its chief provisions.\r\n\r\nBy this edict, or \"placard,\" as it was called, it was ordained that all\r\nwho were convicted of heresy should suffer death \"by fire, by the pit,\r\nor by the sword;\"[388] in other words, should be burned alive, be buried\r\nalive, or be beheaded. These terrible penalties were incurred by all who\r\ndealt in heretical books, or copied or bought them, by all who held or\r\nattended conventicles, by all who disputed on the Scriptures in public\r\nor private, by all who preached or defended the doctrines of reform.\r\nInformers were encouraged by the promise of one half of the confiscated\r\nestate of the heretic. No suspected person was allowed to make any\r\ndonation, or sell any of his effects, or dispose of them by will.\r\nFinally, the courts were instructed to grant no remission or mitigation\r\nof punishment under the fallacious idea of mercy to the convicted party,\r\nand it was made penal for the friends of the accused to solicit such\r\nindulgence on his behalf.[389]\r\n\r\nThe more thoroughly to enforce these edicts, Charles took a hint from\r\nthe terrible tribunal with which he was familiar in Spain,--the\r\nInquisition. He obtained a bull from his old preceptor, Adrian the\r\nSixth, appointing an inquisitor-general, who had authority to examine\r\npersons suspected of heresy, to imprison and torture them, to confiscate\r\ntheir property, and finally sentence them to banishment or death. These\r\nformidable powers were intrusted to a layman,--a lawyer of eminence, and\r\none of the council of Brabant. But this zealous functionary employed his\r\nauthority with so good effect, that it speedily roused the general\r\nindignation of his countrymen, who compelled him to fly for his life.\r\n\r\nBy another bull from Rome, four inquisitors were appointed in the place\r\nof the fugitive. These inquisitors were ecclesiastics, not of the fierce\r\nDominican order, as in Spain, but members of the secular clergy. All\r\npublic officers were enjoined to aid them in detecting and securing\r\nsuspected persons, and the common prisons were allotted for the\r\nconfinement of their victims.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PERSECUTION BY CHARLES THE FIFTH.]\r\n\r\nThe people would seem to have gained little by the substitution of four\r\ninquisitors for one. But in fact they gained a great deal. The sturdy\r\nresistance made to the exercise of the unconstitutional powers of the\r\ninquisitor-general compelled Charles to bring those of the new\r\nfunctionaries more within the limits of the law. For twenty years or\r\nmore their powers seem not to have been well defined. But in 1546 it was\r\ndecreed that no sentence whatever could be pronounced by an inquisitor\r\nwithout the sanction of some member of the provincial council. Thus,\r\nhowever barbarous the law against heresy, the people of the Netherlands\r\nhad this security, that it was only by their own regular courts of\r\njustice that this law was to be interpreted and enforced.[390]\r\n\r\nSuch were the expedients adopted by Charles the Fifth for the\r\nsuppression of heresy in the Netherlands. Notwithstanding the name of\r\n\"inquisitors,\" the new establishment bore faint resemblance to the dread\r\ntribunal of the Spanish Inquisition, with which it has been often\r\nconfounded.[391] The Holy Office presented a vast and complicated\r\nmachinery, skilfully adapted to the existing institutions of Castile. It\r\nmay be said to have formed part of the government itself, and, however\r\nrestricted in its original design, it became in time a formidable\r\npolitical engine, no less than a religious one. The grand-inquisitor was\r\nclothed with an authority before which the monarch himself might\r\ntremble. On some occasions, he even took precedence of the monarch. The\r\ncourts of the Inquisition were distributed throughout the country, and\r\nwere conducted with a solemn pomp that belonged to no civil tribunal.\r\nSpacious buildings were erected for their accommodation, and the\r\ngigantic prisons of the Inquisition rose up, like impregnable\r\nfortresses, in the principal cities of the kingdom. A swarm of menials\r\nand officials waited to do its bidding. The proudest nobles of the land\r\nheld it an honor to serve as familiars of the Holy Office. In the midst\r\nof this external pomp, the impenetrable veil thrown over its proceedings\r\ntook strong hold of the imagination, investing the tribunal with a sort\r\nof supernatural terror. An individual disappeared from the busy scenes\r\nof life. No one knew whither he had gone, till he reappeared, clothed in\r\nthe fatal garb of the _san benito_, to take part in the tragic spectacle\r\nof an _auto da fé_. This was the great triumph of the Inquisition,\r\nrivalling the ancient Roman triumph in the splendor of the show, and\r\nsurpassing it in the solemn and mysterious import of the ceremonial. It\r\nwas hailed with enthusiasm by the fanatical Spaniard of that day, who,\r\nin the martyrdom of the infidel, saw only a sacrifice most acceptable to\r\nthe Deity. The Inquisition succeeded in Spain, for it was suited to the\r\ncharacter of the Spaniard.\r\n\r\nBut it was not suited to the free and independent character of the\r\npeople of the Netherlands. Freedom of thought they claimed as their\r\nbirthright; and the attempt to crush it by introducing the pernicious\r\nusages of Spain was everywhere received with execration. Such an\r\ninstitution was an accident, and could not become an integral part of\r\nthe constitution. It was a vicious graft on a healthy stock. It could\r\nbear no fruit, and sooner or later it must perish.\r\n\r\nYet the Inquisition, such as it was, did its work while it lasted in the\r\nNetherlands. This is true, at least, if we are to receive the popular\r\nstatement, that fifty thousand persons, in the reign of Charles the\r\nFifth, suffered for their religious opinions by the hand of the\r\nexecutioner![392] This monstrous statement has been repeated by one\r\nhistorian after another, with apparently as little distrust as\r\nexamination. It affords one among many examples of the facility with\r\nwhich men adopt the most startling results, especially when conveyed in\r\nthe form of numerical estimates. There is something that strikes the\r\nimagination, in a numerical estimate, which settles a question so\r\nsummarily, in a form so precise and so portable. Yet whoever has had\r\noccasion to make any researches into the past,--that land of\r\nuncertainty,--will agree that there is nothing less entitled to\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nIn the present instance, such a statement might seem to carry its own\r\nrefutation on the face of it. Llorente, the celebrated secretary of the\r\nHoly Office, whose estimates will never be accused of falling short of\r\nthe amount, computes the whole number of victims sacrificed during the\r\nfirst eighteen years of the Inquisition in Castile, when it was in most\r\nactive operation, at about ten thousand.[393] The storm of persecution\r\nthere, it will be remembered, fell chiefly on the Jews,--that ill-omened\r\nrace, from whom every pious Catholic would have rejoiced to see his land\r\npurified by fire and fagot. It will hardly be believed that five times\r\nthe number of these victims perished in a country like the Netherlands,\r\nin a term of time not quite double that occupied for their extermination\r\nin Spain;--the Netherlands, where every instance of such persecution,\r\ninstead of being hailed as a triumph of the Cross, was regarded as a\r\nfresh outrage on the liberties of the nation. It is not too much to say,\r\nthat such a number of martyrs as that pretended would have produced an\r\nexplosion that would have unsettled the authority of Charles himself,\r\nand left for his successor less territory in the Netherlands at the\r\nbeginning of his reign, than he was destined to have at the end of it.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the frequent renewal of the edicts, which was repeated no less\r\nthan nine times during Charles's administration, intimates plainly\r\nenough the very sluggish and unsatisfactory manner in which they had\r\nbeen executed. In some provinces, as Luxembourg and Groningen, the\r\nInquisition was not introduced at all. Gueldres stood on its privileges,\r\nguaranteed to it by the emperor on his accession. And Brabant so\r\neffectually remonstrated on the mischief which the mere name of the\r\nInquisition would do to the trade of the country, and especially of\r\nAntwerp, its capital, that the emperor deemed it prudent to qualify some\r\nof the provisions, and to drop the name of Inquisitor altogether.[394]\r\nThere is no way more sure of rousing the sensibilities of a commercial\r\npeople, than by touching their pockets. Charles did not care to press\r\nmatters to such extremity. He was too politic a prince, too large a\r\ngainer by the prosperity of his people, willingly to put it in peril,\r\neven for conscience' sake. In this lay the difference between him and\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: UNPOPULAR MANNERS OF PHILIP.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, therefore, his occasional abuse of power, and the\r\nlittle respect he may have had at heart for the civil rights of his\r\nsubjects, the government of Charles, as already intimated, was on the\r\nwhole favorable to their commercial interests. He was well repaid by the\r\nenlarged resources of the country, and the aid they afforded him for the\r\nprosecution of his ambitious enterprises. In the course of a few years,\r\nas we are informed by a contemporary, he drew from the Netherlands no\r\nless than twenty-four millions of ducats.[395] And this\r\nsupply--furnished not ungrudgingly, it is true--was lavished, for the\r\nmost part, on objects in which the nation had no interest. In like\r\nmanner, it was the revenues of the Netherlands which defrayed great part\r\nof Philip's expenses in the war that followed his accession. \"Here,\"\r\nexclaims the Venetian envoy, Soriano, \"were the true treasures of the\r\nking of Spain; here were his mines, his Indies, which furnished Charles\r\nwith the means of carrying on his wars for so many years with the\r\nFrench, the Germans, the Italians, which provided for the defence of his\r\nown states, and maintained his dignity and reputation.\"[396]\r\n\r\nSuch then was the condition of the country at the time when the sceptre\r\npassed from the hands of Charles the Fifth into those of Philip the\r\nSecond;--its broad plains teeming with the products of an elaborate\r\nculture; its cities swarming with artisans, skilled in all kinds of\r\ningenious handicraft; its commerce abroad on every sea, and bringing\r\nback rich returns from distant climes. The great body of its people,\r\nwell advanced in the arts of civilization, rejoiced in \"such abundance\r\nof all things,\" says a foreigner who witnessed their prosperity, \"that\r\nthere was no man, however humble, who did not seem rich for his\r\nstation.\"[397] In this active development of their powers, the\r\ninquisitive mind of the inhabitants naturally turned to those great\r\nproblems in religion which were agitating the neighboring countries of\r\nFrance and Germany. All the efforts of Charles were unavailing to check\r\nthe spirit of inquiry; and in the last year of his reign he bitterly\r\nconfessed the total failure of his endeavor to stay the progress of\r\nheresy in the Netherlands.[398] Well had it been for his successor, had\r\nhe taken counsel by the failure of his father, and substituted a more\r\nlenient policy for the ineffectual system of persecution. But such was\r\nnot the policy of Philip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSYSTEM ESTABLISHED BY PHILIP.\r\n\r\nUnpopular Manners of Philip.--He enforces the Edicts.--Increase of\r\nBishoprics.--Margaret of Parma Regent.--Meeting of the\r\nStates-General.--Their spirited Conduct.--Organization of the\r\nCouncils.--Rise and Character of Granvelle.--Philip's Departure.\r\n\r\n\r\n1559.\r\n\r\nPhilip the Second was no stranger to the Netherlands. He had come there,\r\nas it will be remembered, when very young, to be presented by his father\r\nto his future subjects. On that occasion he had greatly disgusted the\r\npeople by that impenetrable reserve which they construed into\r\nhaughtiness, and which strongly contrasted with the gracious manners of\r\nthe emperor. Charles saw with pain the impression which his son had left\r\non his subjects; and the effects of his paternal admonitions were\r\nvisible in a marked change in Philip's deportment on his subsequent\r\nvisit to England. But nature lies deeper than manner; and when Philip\r\nreturned, on his father's abdication, to assume the sovereignty of the\r\nNetherlands, he wore the same frigid exterior as in earlier days.\r\n\r\nHis first step was to visit the different provinces, and receive from\r\nthem their oaths of allegiance. No better occasion could be offered for\r\nconciliating the good-will of the inhabitants. Everywhere his approach\r\nwas greeted with festivities and public rejoicing. The gates of the\r\ncapitals were thrown open to receive him, and the population thronged\r\nout, eager to do homage to their new sovereign. It was a season of\r\njubilee for the whole nation.\r\n\r\nIn this general rejoicing, Philip's eye alone remained dark.[399] Shut\r\nup in his carriage, he seemed desirous to seclude himself from the gaze\r\nof his new subjects, who crowded around, anxious to catch a glimpse of\r\ntheir young monarch.[400] His conduct seemed like a rebuke of their\r\nenthusiasm. Thus chilled as they were in the first flow of their\r\nloyalty, his progress through the land, which should have won him all\r\nhearts, closed all hearts against him.\r\n\r\nThe emperor, when he visited the Netherlands, was like one coming back\r\nto his native country. He spoke the language of the people, dressed in\r\ntheir dress, conformed to their usages and way of life. But Philip was\r\nin everything a Spaniard. He spoke only the Castilian. He adopted the\r\nSpanish etiquette and burdensome ceremonial. He was surrounded by\r\nSpaniards, and, with few exceptions, it was to Spaniards only that he\r\ngave his confidence. Charles had disgusted his Spanish subjects by the\r\nmarked preference he had given to his Flemish. The reverse now took\r\nplace, and Philip displeased the Flemings by his partiality for the\r\nSpaniards. The people of the Netherlands felt with bitterness that the\r\nsceptre of their country had passed into the hands of a foreigner.\r\n\r\nDuring his progress Philip caused reports to be prepared for him of the\r\ncondition of the several provinces, their population and\r\ntrade,--presenting a mass of statistical details, in which, with his\r\nusual industry, he was careful to instruct himself. On his return, his\r\nfirst concern was to provide for the interests of religion. He renewed\r\nhis father's edicts relating to the Inquisition, and in the following\r\nyear confirmed the \"placard\" respecting heresy. In doing this, he was\r\ncareful, by the politic advice of Granvelle, to conform as nearly as\r\npossible to the language of the original edicts, that no charge of\r\ninnovation might be laid to him, and thus the odium of these unpopular\r\nmeasures might remain with their original author.[401]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: UNPOPULAR MANNERS OF PHILIP.]\r\n\r\nBut the object which Philip had most at heart was a reform much needed\r\nin the ecclesiastical establishment of the country. It may seem strange\r\nthat in all the Netherlands there were but three bishoprics,--Arras,\r\nTournay, and Utrecht. A large part of the country was incorporated with\r\nsome one or other of the contiguous German dioceses. The Flemish\r\nbishoprics were of enormous extent. That of Utrecht alone embraced no\r\nless than three hundred walled towns, and eleven hundred churches.[402]\r\nIt was impossible that any pastor, however diligent, could provide for\r\nthe wants of a flock so widely scattered, or that he could exercise\r\nsupervision over the clergy themselves, who had fallen into a lamentable\r\ndecay both of discipline and morals.\r\n\r\nStill greater evils followed from the circumstance of the episcopal\r\nauthority's being intrusted to foreigners. From their ignorance of the\r\ninstitutions of the Netherlands, they were perpetually trespassing on\r\nthe rights of the nation. Another evil consequence was the necessity of\r\ncarrying up ecclesiastical causes, by way of appeal, to foreign\r\ntribunals; a thing, moreover, scarcely practicable in time of war.\r\n\r\nCharles the Fifth, whose sagacious mind has left its impress on the\r\npermanent legislation of the Netherlands, saw the necessity of some\r\nreform in this matter. He accordingly applied to Rome for leave to erect\r\nsix bishoprics, in addition to those previously existing in the country.\r\nBut his attention was too much distracted by other objects to allow time\r\nfor completing his design. With his son Philip, on the other hand, no\r\nobject was allowed to come in competition with the interests of the\r\nChurch. He proposed to make the reform on a larger scale than his father\r\nhad done, and applied to Paul the Fourth for leave to create fourteen\r\nbishoprics and three archbishoprics. The chief difficulty lay in\r\nproviding for the support of the new dignitaries. On consultation with\r\nGranvelle, who had not been advised of the scheme till after Philip's\r\napplication to Rome, it was arranged that the income should be furnished\r\nby the abbey lands of the respective dioceses, and that the abbeys\r\nthemselves should hereafter be placed under the control of priors or\r\nprovosts depending altogether on the bishops. Meanwhile, until the bulls\r\nshould be received from Rome, it was determined to keep the matter\r\nprofoundly secret. It was easy to foresee that a storm of opposition\r\nwould arise, not only among those immediately interested in preserving\r\nthe present order of things, but among the great body of the nobles, who\r\nwould look with an evil eye on the admission into their ranks of so\r\nlarge a number of persons servilely devoted to the interests of the\r\ncrown.[403]\r\n\r\nHaving concluded his arrangements for the internal settlement of the\r\ncountry, Philip naturally turned his thoughts towards Spain. He was the\r\nmore desirous of returning thither from the reports he received, that\r\neven that orthodox land was becoming every day more tainted with the\r\nheretical doctrines so rife in the neighboring countries. There were no\r\nhostilities to detain him longer in the Netherlands, now that the war\r\nwith France had been brought to a close. The provinces, as we have\r\nalready stated, had furnished the king with important aid for carrying\r\non that war, by the grant of a stipulated annual tax for nine years.\r\nThis had not proved equal to his necessities. It was in vain, however,\r\nto expect any further concessions from the states. They had borne, not\r\nwithout murmurs, the heavy burdens laid on them by Charles,--a monarch\r\nwhom they loved. They bore still more impatiently the impositions of a\r\nprince whom they loved so little as Philip. Yet the latter seemed ready\r\nto make any sacrifice of his permanent interests for such temporary\r\nrelief as would extricate him from his present embarrassments. His\r\ncorrespondence with Granvelle on the subject, unfolding the suicidal\r\nschemes which he submitted to that minister, might form an edifying\r\nchapter in the financial history of that day.[404] The difficulty of\r\ncarrying on the government of the Netherlands in this crippled state of\r\nthe finances doubtless strengthened the desire of the monarch to return\r\nto his native land, where the manners and habits of the people were so\r\nmuch more congenial with his own.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the country, it was necessary to provide a suitable\r\nperson to whom the reins of government might be intrusted. The duke of\r\nSavoy, who, since the emperor's abdication, had held the post of regent,\r\nwas now to return to his own dominions, restored to him by the treaty of\r\nCateau-Cambresis. There were several persons who presented themselves\r\nfor this responsible office in the Netherlands. One of the most\r\nprominent was Lamoral, prince of Gavre, count of Egmont, the hero of St.\r\nQuentin and of Gravelines. The illustrious house from which he was\r\ndescended, his chivalrous spirit, his frank and generous bearing, no\r\nless than his brilliant military achievements, had made him the idol of\r\nthe people. There were some who insisted that these achievements\r\ninferred rather the successful soldier than the great captain;[405] and\r\nthat, whatever merit he could boast in the field, it was no proof of his\r\ncapacity for so important a civil station as that of governor of the\r\nNetherlands. Yet it could not be doubted that his nomination would be\r\nmost acceptable to the people. This did not recommend him to Philip.\r\n\r\nAnother candidate was Christine, duchess of Lorraine, the king's cousin.\r\nThe large estates of her house lay in the neighborhood of the\r\nNetherlands. She had shown her talent for political affairs by the part\r\nshe had taken in effecting the arrangements of Cateau-Cambresis. The\r\nprince of Orange, lately become a widower, was desirous, it was said, of\r\nmarrying her daughter. Neither did this prove a recommendation with\r\nPhilip, who was by no means anxious to raise the house of Orange higher\r\nin the scale, still less to intrust it with the destinies of the\r\nNetherlands. In a word, the monarch had no mind to confide the regency\r\nof the country to any one of its powerful nobles.[406]\r\n\r\nThe individual on whom the king at length decided to bestow this mark of\r\nhis confidence was his half-sister, Margaret, duchess of Parma. She was\r\nthe natural daughter of Charles the Fifth, born about four years before\r\nhis marriage with Isabella of Portugal. Margaret's mother, Margaret\r\nVander Gheenst, belonged to a noble Flemish house. Her parents both died\r\nduring her infancy. The little orphan was received into the family of\r\nCount Hoogstraten, who, with his wife, reared her with the same\r\ntenderness as they did their own offspring. At the age of seventeen she\r\nwas unfortunate enough to attract the eye of Charles the Fifth, who,\r\nthen in his twenty-third year, was captivated by the charms of the\r\nFlemish maiden. Margaret's virtue was not proof against the seductions\r\nof her royal suitor; and the victim of love--or of vanity--became the\r\nmother of a child, who received her own name of Margaret.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARGARET OF PARMA REGENT.]\r\n\r\nThe emperor's aunt, then regent of the Netherlands, took charge of the\r\ninfant; and on the death of that princess, she was taken into the family\r\nof the emperor's sister, Mary, queen of Hungary, who succeeded in the\r\nregency. Margaret's birth did not long remain a secret; and she received\r\nan education suited to the high station she was to occupy in life. When\r\nonly twelve years of age, the emperor gave her in marriage to Alexander\r\nde'Medici, grand duke of Tuscany, some fifteen years older than herself.\r\nThe ill-fated connection did not subsist long, as, before twelve months\r\nhad elapsed, it was terminated by the violent death of her husband.\r\n\r\nWhen she had reached the age of womanhood, the hand of the young widow\r\nwas bestowed, together with the duchies of Parma and Placentia as her\r\ndowry, on Ottavio Farnese, grandson of Paul the Third. The bridegroom\r\nwas but twelve years old. Thus again it was Margaret's misfortune that\r\nthere should be such disparity between her own age and that of her\r\nhusband as to exclude anything like sympathy or similarity in their\r\ntastes. In the present instance, the boyish years of Ottavio inspired\r\nher with a sentiment not very different from contempt, that in later\r\nlife settled into an indifference in which both parties appear to have\r\nshared, and which, as a contemporary remarks with _naïveté_, was only\r\nsoftened into a kindlier feeling when the husband and wife had been long\r\nseparated from each other.[407] In truth, Margaret was too ambitious of\r\npower to look on her husband in any other light than that of a rival.\r\n\r\nIn her general demeanor, her air, her gait, she bore great resemblance\r\nto her aunt, the regent. Like her, Margaret was excessively fond of\r\nhunting, and she followed the chase with an intrepidity that might have\r\ndaunted the courage of the keenest sportsman. She had but little of the\r\nnatural softness that belongs to the sex, but in her whole deportment\r\nwas singularly masculine; so that, to render the words of the historian\r\nby a homely phrase, in her woman's dress she seemed like a man in\r\npetticoats.[408] As if to add to the illusion, Nature had given her\r\nsomewhat of a beard; and, to crown the whole, the malady to which she\r\nwas constitutionally subject was a disease to which women are but rarely\r\nliable,--the gout.[409] It was good evidence of her descent from Charles\r\nthe Fifth.\r\n\r\nThough masculine in her appearance, Margaret was not destitute of the\r\nkindlier qualities which are the glory of her sex. Her disposition was\r\ngood; but she relied much on the advice of others, and her more\r\nobjectionable acts may probably be referred rather to their influence\r\nthan to any inclination of her own.\r\n\r\nHer understanding was excellent, her apprehension quick. She showed much\r\nversatility in accommodating herself to the exigencies of her position,\r\nas well as adroitness in the management of affairs, which she may have\r\nacquired in the schools of Italian politics. In religion she was as\r\northodox as Philip the Second could desire. The famous Ignatius Loyola\r\nhad been her confessor in early days. The lessons of humility which he\r\ninculcated were not lost on her, as may be inferred from the care she\r\ntook to perform the ceremony, in Holy Week, of washing the dirty\r\nfeet--she preferred them in this condition--of twelve poor maidens;[410]\r\noutstripping, in this particular, the humility of the pope\r\nhimself.--Such was the character of Margaret, duchess of Parma, who now,\r\nin the thirty-eighth year of her age, was called, at a most critical\r\nperiod, to take the helm of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThe appointment seems to have given equal satisfaction to herself and to\r\nher husband, and no objection was made to Philip's purpose of taking\r\nback with him to Castile their little son, Alexander Farnese,--a name\r\ndestined to become in later times so renowned in the Netherlands. The\r\navowed purpose was to give the boy a training suited to his rank, under\r\nthe eye of Philip; combined with which, according to the historian, was\r\nthe desire of holding a hostage for the fidelity of Margaret and of her\r\nhusband, whose dominions in Italy lay contiguous to those of Philip in\r\nthat country.[411]\r\n\r\nEarly in June, 1559, Margaret of Parma, having reached the Low\r\nCountries, made her entrance in great state into Brussels, where Philip\r\nawaited her, surrounded by his whole court of Spanish and Flemish\r\nnobles. The duke of Savoy was also present, as well as Margaret's\r\nhusband, the duke of Parma, then in attendance on Philip. The\r\nappointment of Margaret was not distasteful to the people of the\r\nNetherlands, for she was their countrywoman, and her early days had been\r\npassed amongst them. Her presence was not less welcome to Philip, who\r\nlooked forward with eagerness to the hour of his departure. His first\r\npurpose was to present the new regent to the nation, and for this he\r\nsummoned a meeting of the States-General at Ghent, in the coming August.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fifth of July, he repaired with his court to this ancient\r\ncapital, which still smarted under the effects of that chastisement of\r\nhis father, which, terrible as it was, had not the power to break the\r\nspirits of the men of Ghent. The presence of the court was celebrated\r\nwith public rejoicings, which continued for three days, during which\r\nPhilip held a chapter of the Golden Fleece for the election of fourteen\r\nknights. The ceremony was conducted with the magnificence with which the\r\nmeetings of this illustrious order were usually celebrated. It was\r\nmemorable as the last chapter of it ever held.[412] Founded by the dukes\r\nof Burgundy, the order of the Golden Fleece drew its members immediately\r\nfrom the nobility of the Netherlands. When the Spanish sovereign, who\r\nremained at its head, no more resided in the country, the chapters were\r\ndiscontinued; and the knights derived their appointment from the simple\r\nnomination of the monarch.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth of August, the States-General assembled at Ghent. The\r\nsturdy burghers who took their seats in this body came thither in no\r\nvery friendly temper to the government. Various subjects of complaint\r\nhad long been rankling in their bosoms, and now found vent in the form\r\nof animated and angry debate. The people had been greatly alarmed by the\r\navowed policy of their rulers to persevere in the system of religious\r\npersecution, as shown especially by the revival of the ancient edicts\r\nagainst heresy and in support of the Inquisition. Rumors had gone\r\nabroad, probably with exaggeration, of the proposed episcopal reforms.\r\nHowever necessary, they were now regarded only as part of the great\r\nscheme of persecution. Different nations, it was urged, required to be\r\nguided by different laws. What suited the Spaniards would not for that\r\nreason suit the people of the Netherlands. The Inquisition was ill\r\nadapted to men accustomed from their cradles to freedom of thought and\r\naction. Persecution was not to be justified in matters of conscience,\r\nand men were not to be reclaimed from spiritual error by violence, but\r\nby gentleness and persuasion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MEETING OF THE STATES-GENERAL.]\r\n\r\nBut what most called forth the invective of the Flemish orators was the\r\npresence of a large body of foreign troops in the country. When Philip\r\ndisbanded his forces after the French war had terminated, there still\r\nremained a corps of the old Spanish infantry, amounting to some three or\r\nfour thousands, which he thought proper to retain in the western\r\nprovinces. His avowed object was to protect the country from any\r\nviolence on the part of the French. Another reason assigned by him was\r\nthe difficulty of raising funds to pay their arrears. The true motive,\r\nin the opinion of the states, was to enforce the execution of the new\r\nmeasures, and overcome any resistance that might be made in the country.\r\nThese troops, like most of the soldiers of that day, who served for\r\nplunder quite as much as for pay, had as little respect for the rights\r\nor the property of their allies, as for those of their enemies. They\r\nquartered themselves on the peaceful inhabitants of the country, and\r\nobtained full compensation for loss of pay by a system of rapine and\r\nextortion that beggared the people, and drove them to desperation.\r\nConflicts with the soldiery occasionally occurred, and in some parts the\r\npeasantry even refused to repair the dikes, in order to lay the country\r\nunder water rather than submit to such outrages! \"How is it,\" exclaimed\r\nthe bold syndic of Ghent, \"that we find foreign soldiers thus quartered\r\non us, in open violation of our liberties? Are not our own troops able\r\nto protect us from the dangers of invasion? Must we be ground to the\r\ndust by the exactions of these mercenaries in peace, after being\r\nburdened with the maintenance of them in war?\" These remonstrances were\r\nfollowed by a petition to the throne, signed by members of the other\r\norders as well as the commons, requesting that the king would be\r\ngraciously pleased to respect the privileges of the nation, and send\r\nback the foreign troops to their own homes.\r\n\r\nPhilip, who sat in the assembly with his sister, the future regent, by\r\nhis side, was not prepared for this independent spirit in the burghers\r\nof the Netherlands. The royal ear had been little accustomed to this\r\nstrain of invective from the subject. For it was rare that the tone of\r\nremonstrance was heard in the halls of Castilian legislation, since the\r\npower of the commons had been broken on the field of Villalar. Unable or\r\nunwilling to conceal his displeasure, the king descended from his\r\nthrone, and abruptly quitted the assembly.[413]\r\n\r\nYet he did not, like Charles the First of England, rashly vent his\r\nindignation by imprisoning or persecuting the members who had roused it.\r\nEven the stout syndic of Ghent was allowed to go unharmed. Philip looked\r\nabove him to a mark more worthy of his anger,--to those of the higher\r\norders who had encouraged the spirit of resistance in the commons. The\r\nmost active of these malecontents was William of Orange. That noble, as\r\nit may be remembered, was one of the hostages who remained at the Court\r\nof Henry the Second for the fulfilment of the treaty of\r\nCateau-Cambresis. While there, a strange disclosure was made to the\r\nprince by the French monarch, who told him that, through the duke of\r\nAlva, a secret treaty had been entered into with his master, the king of\r\nSpain, for the extirpation of heresy throughout their dominions. This\r\ninconsiderate avowal of the French king was made to William on the\r\nsupposition that he was stanch in the Roman Catholic faith, and entirely\r\nin his master's confidence. Whatever may have been the prince's claims\r\nto orthodoxy at this period, it is certain he was not in Philip's\r\nconfidence. It is equally certain that he possessed one Christian virtue\r\nwhich belonged neither to Philip nor to Henry,--the virtue of\r\ntoleration. Greatly shocked by the intelligence he had received, William\r\nat once communicated it to several of his friends in the Netherlands.\r\nOne of the letters unfortunately fell into Philip's hands. The prince\r\nsoon after obtained permission to return to his own country, bent, as he\r\ntells us in his Apology, on ridding it of the Spanish vermin.[414]\r\nPhilip, who understood the temper of his mind, had his eye on his\r\nmovements, and knew well to what source, in part at least, he was to\r\nattribute the present opposition. It was not long after, that a\r\nCastilian courtier intimated to the prince of Orange and to Egmont, that\r\nit would be well for them to take heed to themselves; that the names of\r\nthose who had signed the petition for the removal of the troops had been\r\nnoted down, and that Philip and his council were resolved, when a\r\nfitting occasion offered, to call them to a heavy reckoning for their\r\ntemerity.[415]\r\n\r\nYet the king so far yielded to the wishes of the people as to promise\r\nthe speedy departure of the troops. But no power on earth could have\r\nbeen strong enough to shake his purpose where the interests of religion\r\nwere involved. Nor would he abate one jot of the stern provisions of the\r\nedicts. When one of his ministers, more hardy than the rest, ventured to\r\nsuggest to him that perseverance in this policy might cost him the\r\nsovereignty of the provinces, \"Better not reign at all,\" he answered,\r\n\"than reign over heretics!\"[416]--an answer extolled by some as the\r\nheight of the sublime, by others derided as the extravagance of a\r\nfanatic. In whatever light we view it, it must be admitted to furnish\r\nthe key to the permanent policy of Philip in his government of the\r\nNetherlands.\r\n\r\nBefore dissolving the States-General, Philip, unacquainted with the\r\nlanguage of the country, addressed the deputies through the mouth of the\r\nbishop of Arras. He expatiated on the warmth of his attachment to his\r\ngood people of the Netherlands, and paid them a merited tribute for\r\ntheir loyalty both to his father and to himself. He enjoined on them to\r\nshow similar respect to the regent, their own countrywoman, into whose\r\nhands he had committed the government. They would reverence the laws and\r\nmaintain public tranquillity. Nothing would conduce to this so much as\r\nthe faithful execution of the edicts. It was their sacred duty to aid in\r\nthe extermination of heretics,--the deadliest foes both of God and their\r\nsovereign. Philip concluded by assuring the states that he should soon\r\nreturn in person to the Netherlands, or send his son Don Carlos as his\r\nrepresentative.\r\n\r\nThe answer of the legislature was temperate and respectful. They made no\r\nallusion to Philip's proposed ecclesiastical reforms, as he had not\r\nauthorized this by any allusion to them himself. They still pressed,\r\nhowever, the removal of the foreign troops, and the further removal of\r\nall foreigners from office, as contrary to the constitution of the land.\r\nThis last shaft was aimed at Granvelle, who held a high post in the\r\ngovernment, and was understood to be absolute in the confidence of the\r\nking. Philip renewed his assurances of the dismissal of the forces, and\r\nthat within the space, as he promised, of four months. The other request\r\nof the deputies he did not condescend to notice. His feelings on the\r\nsubject were intimated in an exclamation he made to one of his\r\nministers: \"I too am a foreigner; will they refuse to obey me as their\r\nsovereign?\"[417]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ORGANIZATION OF THE COUNCILS.]\r\n\r\nThe regent was to be assisted in the government by three councils which\r\nof old time had existed in the land;--the council of finance, for the\r\nadministration, as the name implies, of the revenues; the privy council,\r\nfor affairs of justice and the internal concerns of the country; and the\r\ncouncil of state, for matters relating to peace and war, and the foreign\r\npolicy of the nation. Into this last, the supreme council, entered\r\nseveral of the Flemish nobles, and among them the prince of Orange and\r\nCount Egmont. There were, besides, Count Barlaimont, president of the\r\ncouncil of finance, Viglius, president of the privy council, and lastly\r\nGranvelle, bishop of Arras.\r\n\r\nThe regent was to act with the coöperation of these several bodies in\r\ntheir respective departments. In the conduct of the government, she was\r\nto be guided by the council of state. But by private instructions of\r\nPhilip, questions of a more delicate nature, involving the tranquillity\r\nof the country, might be first submitted to a select portion of this\r\ncouncil; and in such cases, or when a spirit of faction had crept into\r\nthe council, the regent, if she deemed it for the interest of the state,\r\nmight adopt the opinion of the minority. The select body with whom\r\nMargaret was to advise in the more important matters was termed the\r\n_Consulta_; and the members who composed it were Barlaimont, Viglius,\r\nand the bishop of Arras.[418]\r\n\r\nThe first of these men, Count Barlaimont, belonged to an ancient Flemish\r\nfamily. With respectable talents and constancy of purpose, he was\r\nentirely devoted to the interests of the crown. The second, Viglius, was\r\na jurist of extensive erudition, at this time well advanced in years,\r\nand with infirmities that might have pressed heavily on a man less\r\npatient of toil. He was personally attached to Granvelle; and as his\r\nviews of government coincided very nearly with that minister's, Viglius\r\nwas much under his influence. The last of the three, Granvelle, from his\r\nlarge acquaintance with affairs, and his adroitness in managing them,\r\nwas far superior to his colleagues;[419] and he soon acquired such an\r\nascendancy over them, that the government may be said to have rested on\r\nhis shoulders. As there is no man who for some years is to take so\r\nprominent a part in the story of the Netherlands, it will be proper to\r\nintroduce the reader to some acquaintance with his earlier history.\r\n\r\nAnthony Perrenot--whose name of Granvelle was derived from an estate\r\npurchased by his father--was born in the year 1517, at Besançon, a town\r\nin Franche Comté. His father, Nicholas Perrenot, founded the fortunes of\r\nthe family, and from the humble condition of a poor country attorney\r\nrose to the rank of chancellor of the empire. This extraordinary\r\nadvancement was not owing to caprice, but to his unwearied industry,\r\nextensive learning, and a clear and comprehensive intellect, combined\r\nwith steady devotion to the interests of his master, Charles the Fifth.\r\nHis talent for affairs led him to be employed not merely in official\r\nbusiness, but in diplomatic missions of great importance. In short, he\r\npossessed the confidence of the emperor to a degree enjoyed by no other\r\nsubject; and when the chancellor died, in 1550, Charles pronounced his\r\neulogy to Philip in a single sentence, saying that in Granvelle they had\r\nlost the man on whose wisdom they could securely repose.[420]\r\n\r\nAnthony Perrenot, distinguished from his father in later times as\r\nCardinal Granvelle, was the eldest of eleven children. In his childhood\r\nhe discovered such promise, that the chancellor bestowed much pains\r\npersonally on his instruction. At fourteen he was sent to Padua, and\r\nafter some years was removed to Louvain, then the university of greatest\r\nrepute in the Netherlands. It was not till later that the seminary of\r\nDouay was founded, under the auspices of Philip the Second.[421] At the\r\nuniversity, the young Perrenot soon distinguished himself by the\r\nvivacity of his mind, the acuteness of his perceptions, an industry\r\nfully equal to his father's, and remarkable powers of acquisition.\r\nBesides a large range of academic study, he made himself master of seven\r\nlanguages, so as to read and converse in them with fluency. He seemed to\r\nhave little relish for the amusements of the youth of his own age. His\r\ngreatest amusement was a book. Under this incessant application his\r\nhealth gave way, and for a time his studies were suspended.\r\n\r\nWhether from his father's preference or his own, young Granvelle\r\nembraced the ecclesiastical profession. At the age of twenty-one he was\r\nadmitted to orders. The son of the chancellor was not slow in his\r\nadvancement, and he was soon possessed of several good benefices. But\r\nthe ambitious and worldly temper of Granvelle was not to be satisfied\r\nwith the humble duties of the ecclesiastic. It was not long before he\r\nwas called to court by his father, and there a brilliant career was\r\nopened to his aspiring genius.\r\n\r\nThe young man soon showed such talent for business, and such shrewd\r\ninsight into character, as, combined with the stores of learning he had\r\nat his command, made his services of great value to his father. He\r\naccompanied the chancellor on some of his public missions, among others\r\nto the Council of Trent, where the younger Granvelle, who had already\r\nbeen promoted to the see of Arras, first had the opportunity of\r\ndisplaying that subtle, insinuating eloquence, which captivated as much\r\nas it convinced.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RISE AND CHARACTER OF GRANVELLE.]\r\n\r\nThe emperor saw with satisfaction the promise afforded by the young\r\nstatesman, and looked forward to the time when he would prove the same\r\npillar of support to his administration that his father had been before\r\nhim. Nor was that time far distant. As the chancellor's health declined,\r\nthe son became more intimately associated with his father in the\r\ncounsels of the emperor. He justified this confidence by the unwearied\r\ntoil with which he devoted himself to the business of the cabinet; a\r\ntoil to which even night seemed to afford no respite. He sometimes\r\nemployed five secretaries at once, dictating to them in as many\r\ndifferent languages.[422] The same thing, or something as miraculous,\r\nhas been told of other remarkable men, both before and since. As a mere\r\n_tour de force_ Granvelle may possibly have amused himself with it. But\r\nit was not in this way that the correspondence was written which\r\nfurnishes the best key to the events of the time. If it had been so\r\nwritten, it would never have been worth the publication.\r\n\r\nEvery evening Granvelle presented himself before the emperor, and read\r\nto him the programme he had prepared of the business of the following\r\nday, with his own suggestions.[423] The foreign ambassadors who resided\r\nat the court were surprised to find the new minister so entirely in the\r\nsecrets of his master; and that he was as well instructed in all their\r\ndoings as the emperor himself.[424] In short, the confidence of Charles,\r\ngiven slowly and with much hesitation, was at length bestowed as freely\r\non the son as it had been on the father. The two Granvelles may be truly\r\nsaid to have been the two persons who most possessed the confidence of\r\nthe emperor, from the time that he took the reins of government into his\r\nown hands.\r\n\r\nWhen raised to the see of Arras, Granvelle was but twenty-five years\r\nold. It is rare that the mitre has descended on a man of a more\r\nambitious spirit. Yet Granvelle was not averse to the good things of the\r\nworld, nor altogether insensible to its pomps and vanities. He affected\r\ngreat state in his manner of living, and thus necessity, no less than\r\ntaste, led him to covet the possession of wealth as well as of power. He\r\nobtained both; and his fortunes were rapidly advancing when, by the\r\nabdication of his royal master, the sceptre passed into the hands of\r\nPhilip the Second.\r\n\r\nCharles recommended Granvelle to his son as every way deserving of his\r\nconfidence. Granvelle knew that the best recommendation--the only\r\neffectual one--must come from himself. He studied carefully the\r\ncharacter of his new sovereign, and showed a wonderful flexibility in\r\nconforming to his humors. The ambitious minister proved himself no\r\nstranger to those arts by which great minds, as well as little ones,\r\nsometimes condescend to push their fortunes in a court.\r\n\r\nYet, in truth, Granvelle did not always do violence to his own\r\ninclinations in conforming to those of Philip. Like the king, he did not\r\ncome rapidly to results, but pondered long, and viewed a question in all\r\nits bearings, before arriving at a decision. He had, as we have seen,\r\nthe same patient spirit of application as Philip, so that both may be\r\nsaid to have found their best recreation in labor. Neither was he less\r\nzealous than the king for the maintenance of the true faith, though his\r\naccommodating nature, if left to itself, might have sanctioned a\r\ndifferent policy from that dictated by the stern, uncompromising spirit\r\nof his master.\r\n\r\nGranvelle's influence was further aided by the charms of his personal\r\nintercourse. His polished and insinuating manners seem to have melted\r\neven the icy reserve of Philip. He maintained his influence by his\r\nsingular tact in suggesting hints for carrying out his master's policy,\r\nin such a way that the suggestion might seem to have come from the king\r\nhimself. Thus careful not to alarm the jealousy of his sovereign, he was\r\ncontent to forego the semblance of power for the real possession of\r\nit.[425]\r\n\r\nIt was soon seen that he was as well settled in the confidence of Philip\r\nas he had previously been in that of Charles. Notwithstanding the\r\napparent distribution of power between the regent and the several\r\ncouncils, the arrangements made by the king were such as to throw the\r\nreal authority into the hands of Granvelle. Thus the rare example was\r\nafforded of the same man continuing the favorite of two successive\r\nsovereigns. Granvelle did not escape the usual fate of favorites; and\r\nwhether from the necessity of the case, or that, as some pretend, he did\r\nnot on his elevation bear his faculties too meekly, no man was so\r\ngenerally and so heartily detested throughout the country.[426]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the Netherlands, Philip named the governors of the\r\nseveral provinces,--the nominations, for the most part, only confirming\r\nthose already in office. Egmont had the governments of Flanders and\r\nArtois; the prince of Orange, those of Holland, Zealand, Utrecht, and\r\nWest Friesland. The commission to William, running in the usual form,\r\nnoticed \"the good, loyal, and notable services he had rendered both to\r\nthe emperor and his present sovereign.\"[427] The command of two\r\nbattalions of the Spanish army was also given to the two nobles,--a poor\r\ncontrivance for reconciling the nation to the continuance of these\r\ndetested troops in the country.\r\n\r\nPhilip had anxiously waited for the arrival of the papal bull which was\r\nto authorize the erection of the bishoprics. Granvelle looked still more\r\nanxiously for it. He had read the signs of the coming storm, and would\r\ngladly have encountered it when the royal presence might have afforded\r\nsome shelter from its fury. But the court of Rome moved at its usual\r\ndilatory pace, and the apostolic nuncio did not arrive with the missive\r\ntill the eve of Philip's departure,--too late for him to witness its\r\npublication.[428]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PHILIP'S DEPARTURE.]\r\n\r\nHaving completed all his arrangements, about the middle of August the\r\nking proceeded to Zealand, where, in the port of Flushing, lay a gallant\r\nfleet, waiting to take him and the royal suite to Spain. It consisted of\r\nfifty Spanish and forty other vessels,--all well manned, and victualled\r\nfor a much longer voyage.[429] Philip was escorted to the place of\r\nembarkation by a large body of Flemish nobles, together with the foreign\r\nambassadors and the duke and duchess of Savoy. A curious scene is\r\nreported to have taken place as he was about to go on board. Turning\r\nabruptly round to the prince of Orange, who had attended him on the\r\njourney, he bluntly accused him of being the true source of the\r\nopposition which his measures had encountered in the States-General.\r\nWilliam, astonished at the suddenness of the attack, replied that the\r\nopposition was to be regarded, not as the act of an individual, but of\r\nthe states. \"No,\" rejoined the incensed monarch, shaking him at the same\r\ntime violently by the wrist, \"not the states, but you, you, you!\"[430]\r\nan exclamation deriving additional bitterness from the fact that the\r\nword _you_, thus employed, in the Castilian was itself indicative of\r\ncontempt. William did not think it prudent to reply, nor did he care to\r\ntrust himself with the other Flemish lords on board the royal\r\nsquadron.[431]\r\n\r\nThe royal company being at length all on board, on the twentieth of\r\nAugust, 1559, the fleet weighed anchor; and Philip, taking leave of the\r\nduke and duchess of Savoy, and the rest of the noble train who attended\r\nhis embarkation, was soon wafted from the shores,--to which he was never\r\nto return.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Luc-Jean-Joseph Vandervynckt, to whom I have repeatedly had\r\n     occasion to refer in the course of the preceding chapter, was a\r\n     Fleming,--born at Ghent in 1691. He was educated to the law, became\r\n     eminent in his profession, and at the age of thirty-eight was made\r\n     a member of the council of Flanders. He employed his leisure in\r\n     studying the historical antiquities of his own country. At the\r\n     suggestion of Coblentz, prime minister of Maria Theresa, he\r\n     compiled his work on the Troubles of the Netherlands. It was\r\n     designed for the instruction of the younger branches of the\r\n     imperial family, and six copies only of it were at first printed,\r\n     in 1765. Since the author's death, which took place in 1779, when\r\n     he had reached the great age of eighty-eight, the work has been\r\n     repeatedly published.\r\n\r\n     As Vandervynckt had the national archives thrown open to his\r\n     inspection, he had access to the most authentic sources of\r\n     information. He was a man of science and discernment, fair-minded,\r\n     and temperate in his opinions, which gives value to a book that\r\n     contains, moreover, much interesting anecdote, not elsewhere to be\r\n     found. The work, though making only four volumes, covers a large\r\n     space of historical ground,--from the marriage of Philip the Fair,\r\n     in 1495, to the peace of Westphalia, in 1648. Its literary\r\n     execution is by no means equal to its other merits. The work is\r\n     written in French; but Vandervynckt, unfortunately, while he both\r\n     wrote and spoke Flemish, and even Latin, with facility, was but\r\n     indifferently acquainted with French.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPROTESTANTISM IN SPAIN.\r\n\r\nPhilip's Arrival in Spain.--The Reformed Doctrines.--Their\r\nSuppression.--Autos da Fé.--Prosecution of Carranza.--Extinction of\r\nHeresy.--Fanaticism of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n1559.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe voyage of King Philip was a short and prosperous one. On the\r\ntwenty-ninth of August, 1559, he arrived off the port of Laredo. But\r\nwhile he was in sight of land, the weather, which had been so\r\npropitious, suddenly changed. A furious tempest arose, which scattered\r\nhis little navy. Nine of the vessels foundered, and though the monarch\r\nhad the good fortune, under the care of an experienced pilot, to make\r\nhis escape in a boat, and reach the shore in safety, he had the\r\nmortification to see the ship which had borne him go down with the rest,\r\nand with her the inestimable cargo he had brought from the Low\r\nCountries. It consisted of curious furniture, tapestries, gems, pieces\r\nof sculpture, and paintings,--the rich productions of Flemish and\r\nItalian art, which his father, the emperor, had been employed many years\r\nof his life in collecting. Truly was it said of Charles, that \"he had\r\nsacked the land only to feed the ocean.\"[432] To add to the calamity,\r\nmore than a thousand persons perished in this shipwreck.[433]\r\n\r\nThe king, without delay, took the road to Valladolid; but on arriving at\r\nthat capital, whether depressed by his late disaster, or from his\r\nhabitual dislike of such empty parade, he declined the honors, with\r\nwhich the loyal inhabitants would have greeted the return of their\r\nsovereign to his dominions. Here he was cordially welcomed by his\r\nsister, the Regent Joanna, who, long since weary of the cares of\r\nsovereignty, resigned the sceptre into his hands, with a better will\r\nthan that with which most persons would have received it. Here, too, he\r\nhad the satisfaction of embracing his son Carlos, the heir to his\r\nempire. The length of Philip's absence may have allowed him to see some\r\nfavorable change in the person of the young prince, though, if report be\r\ntrue, there was little change for the better in his disposition, which,\r\nheadstrong and imperious, had already begun to make men tremble for the\r\nfuture destinies of their country.\r\n\r\nPhilip had not been many days in Valladolid when his presence was\r\ncelebrated by one of those exhibitions, which, unhappily for Spain,\r\nmaybe called national. This was an _auto da fé_, not, however, as\r\nformerly, of Jews and Moors, but of Spanish Protestants. The Reformation\r\nhad been silently, but not slowly, advancing in the Peninsula; and\r\nintelligence of this, as we have already seen, was one cause of Philip's\r\nabrupt departure from the Netherlands. The brief but disastrous attempt\r\nat a religious revolution in Spain is an event of too much importance to\r\nbe passed over in silence by the historian.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE REFORMED DOCTRINES.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the remote position of Spain, under the imperial sceptre\r\nof Charles she was brought too closely into contact with the other\r\nstates of Europe not to feel the shock of the great religious reform\r\nwhich was shaking those states to their foundations. Her most intimate\r\nrelations, indeed, were with those very countries in which the seeds of\r\nthe Reformation were first planted. It was no uncommon thing for\r\nSpaniards, in the sixteenth century, to be indebted for some portion of\r\ntheir instruction to German universities. Men of learning, who\r\naccompanied the emperor, became familiar with the religious doctrines so\r\nwidely circulated in Germany and Flanders. The troops gathered the same\r\ndoctrines from the Lutheran soldiers, who occasionally served with them\r\nunder the imperial banners. These opinions, crude for the most part as\r\nthey were, they brought back to their own country; and a curiosity was\r\nroused which prepared the mind for the reception of the great truths\r\nwhich were quickening the other nations of Europe. Men of higher\r\neducation, on their return to Spain, found the means of disseminating\r\nthese truths. Secret societies were established; meetings were held;\r\nand, with the same secrecy as in the days of the early Christians, the\r\nGospel was preached and explained to the growing congregation of the\r\nfaithful. The greatest difficulty was the want of books. The enterprise\r\nof a few self-devoted proselytes at length overcame this difficulty.\r\n\r\nA Castilian version of the Bible had been printed in Germany. Various\r\nProtestant publications, whether originating in the Castilian or\r\ntranslated into that language, appeared in the same country. A copy, now\r\nand then, in the possession of some private individual, had found its\r\nway, without detection, across the Pyrenees. These instances were rare,\r\nwhen a Spaniard named Juan Hernandez, resident in Geneva, where he\r\nfollowed the business of a corrector of the press, undertook, from no\r\nother motive but zeal for the truth, to introduce a larger supply of the\r\nforbidden fruit into his native land.\r\n\r\nWith great adroitness, he evaded the vigilance of the custom-house\r\nofficers, and the more vigilant spies of the Inquisition, and in the end\r\nsucceeded in landing two large casks filled with prohibited works, which\r\nwere quickly distributed among the members of the infant church. Other\r\nintrepid converts followed the example of Hernandez, and with similar\r\nsuccess; so that, with the aid of books and spiritual teachers, the\r\nnumber of the faithful multiplied daily throughout the country.[434]\r\nAmong this number was a much larger proportion, it was observed, of\r\npersons of rank and education than is usually found in like cases; owing\r\ndoubtless to the circumstance that it was this class of persons who had\r\nmost frequented the countries where the Lutheran doctrines were taught.\r\nThus the Reformed Church grew and prospered, not indeed as it had\r\nprospered in the freer atmospheres of Germany and Britain, but as well\r\nas it could possibly do under the blighting influence of the\r\nInquisition; like some tender plant, which, nurtured in the shade, waits\r\nonly for a more genial season for its full expansion. That season was\r\nnot in reserve for it in Spain.\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange that the spread of the Reformed religion should so\r\nlong have escaped the detection of the agents of the Holy Office. Yet it\r\nis certain that the first notice which the Spanish inquisitors received\r\nof the fact was from their brethren abroad. Some ecclesiastics in the\r\ntrain of Philip, suspecting the heresy of several of their own\r\ncountrymen in the Netherlands, had them seized and sent to Spain, to be\r\nexamined by the Inquisition. On a closer investigation, it was found\r\nthat a correspondence had long been maintained between these persons and\r\ntheir countrymen, of a similar persuasion with themselves, at home. Thus\r\nthe existence, though not the extent, of the Spanish Reformation was\r\nmade known.[435]\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the alarm sounded, than Paul the Fourth, quick to follow\r\nup the scent of heresy in any quarter of his pontifical dominions,\r\nissued a brief, in February, 1558, addressed to the Spanish\r\ninquisitor-general. In this brief, his holiness enjoins it on the head\r\nof the tribunal to spare no efforts to detect and exterminate the\r\ngrowing evil; and he empowers that functionary to arraign and bring to\r\ncondign punishment all suspected of heresy, of whatever rank or\r\nprofession,--whether bishops or archbishops, nobles, kings, or emperors.\r\nPaul the Fourth was fond of contemplating himself as seated in the chair\r\nof the Innocents and the Gregories, and like them setting his pontifical\r\nfoot on the necks of princes. His natural arrogance was probably not\r\ndiminished by the concessions which Philip the Second had thought proper\r\nto make to him at the close of the Roman war.\r\n\r\nPhilip, far from taking umbrage at the swelling tone of this apostolical\r\nmandate, followed it up, in the same year, by a monstrous edict,\r\nborrowed from one in the Netherlands, which condemned all who bought,\r\nsold, or read prohibited works to be burned alive.\r\n\r\nIn the following January, Paul, to give greater efficacy to this edict,\r\npublished another bull, in which he commanded all confessors, under pain\r\nof excommunication, to enjoin on their penitents to inform against all\r\npersons, however nearly allied to them, who might be guilty of such\r\npractices. To quicken the zeal of the informer, Philip, on his part,\r\nrevived a law fallen somewhat into disuse, by which the accuser was to\r\nreceive one fourth of the confiscated property of the convicted party.\r\nAnd finally, a third bull from Paul allowed the inquisitors to withhold\r\na pardon from the recanting heretic, if any doubt existed of his\r\nsincerity; thus placing the life as well as fortune of the unhappy\r\nprisoner entirely at the mercy of judges who had an obvious interest in\r\nfinding him guilty. In this way the pope and the king continued to play\r\ninto each other's hands, and while his holiness artfully spread the\r\ntoils, the king devised the means for driving the quarry into them.[436]\r\n\r\nFortunately for these plans, the Inquisition was at this time under the\r\ndirection of a man peculiarly fitted to execute them. This was Fernando\r\nValdés, cardinal-archbishop of Seville, a person of a hard, inexorable\r\nnature, and possessed of as large a measure of fanaticism as ever fell\r\nto a grand-inquisitor since the days of Torquemada. Valdés readily\r\navailed himself of the terrible machinery placed under his control.\r\nCareful not to alarm the suspected parties, his approaches were slow and\r\nstealthy. He was the chief of a tribunal which sat in darkness, and\r\nwhich dealt by invisible agents. He worked long and silently under\r\nground before firing the mine which was to bury his enemies in a general\r\nruin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUPPRESSION OF THE REFORM.]\r\n\r\nHis spies were everywhere abroad, mingling with the suspected, and\r\ninsinuating themselves into their confidence. At length, by the\r\ntreachery of some, and by working on the nervous apprehensions or the\r\nreligions scruples of others, he succeeded in detecting the\r\nlurking-places of the new heresy, and the extent of ground which it\r\ncovered. This was much larger than had been imagined, although the\r\nReformation in Spain seemed less formidable from the number of its\r\nproselytes than from their character and position. Many of them were\r\necclesiastics, especially intrusted with maintaining the purity of the\r\nfaith. The quarters in which the heretical doctrines most prevailed were\r\nAragon, which held an easy communication with the Huguenots of France,\r\nand the ancient cities of Seville and Valladolid, indebted less to any\r\nlocal advantages than to the influence of a few eminent men, who had\r\nearly embraced the faith of the Reformers.\r\n\r\nAt length, the preliminary information having been obtained, the\r\nproscribed having been marked out, the plan of attack settled, an order\r\nwas given for the simultaneous arrest of all persons suspected of\r\nheresy, throughout the kingdom. It fell like a thunderbolt on the\r\nunhappy victims, who had gone on with their secret associations, little\r\nsuspecting the ruin that hung over them. No resistance was attempted.\r\nMen and women, churchmen and laymen, persons of all ranks and\r\nprofessions, were hurried from their homes, and lodged in the secret\r\nchambers of the Inquisition. Yet these could not furnish accommodations\r\nfor the number, and many were removed to the ordinary prisons, and even\r\nto convents and private dwellings. In Seville alone eight hundred were\r\narrested on the first day. Fears were entertained of an attempt at\r\nrescue, and an additional guard was stationed over the places of\r\nconfinement. The inquisitors were in the condition of a fisherman whose\r\ncast has been so successful that the draught of fishes seems likely to\r\nprove too heavy for his net.[437]\r\n\r\nThe arrest of one party gradually led to the detection of others.\r\nDragged from his solitary dungeon before the secret tribunal of the\r\nInquisition, alone, without counsel to aid or one friendly face to cheer\r\nhim, without knowing the name of his accuser, without being allowed to\r\nconfront the witnesses who were there to swear away his life, without\r\neven a sight of his own process, except such garbled extracts as the\r\nwily judges thought fit to communicate, is it strange that the unhappy\r\nvictim, in his perplexity and distress, should have been drawn into\r\ndisclosures fatal to his associates and himself? If these disclosures\r\nwere not to the mind of his judges, they had only to try the efficacy of\r\nthe torture,--the rack, the cord, and the pulley,--until, when every\r\njoint had been wrenched from its socket, the barbarous tribunal was\r\ncompelled to suspend, not terminate, the application, from the inability\r\nof the sufferer to endure it. Such were the dismal scenes enacted in the\r\nname of religion, and by the ministers of religion, as well as of the\r\nInquisition,--scenes to which few of those who had once witnessed them,\r\nand escaped with life, dared ever to allude. For to reveal the secrets\r\nof the Inquisition was death.[438]\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of eighteen months from the period of the first\r\narrests, many of the trials had been concluded, the doom of the\r\nprisoners was sealed, and it was thought time that the prisons should\r\ndisgorge their superfluous inmates. Valladolid was selected as the\r\ntheatre of the first _auto da fé_, both from the importance of the\r\ncapital and the presence of the court, which would thus sanction and\r\ngive greater dignity to the celebration. This event took place in May,\r\n1559. The Regent Joanna, the young prince of the Asturias, Don Carlos,\r\nand the principal grandees of the court, were there to witness the\r\nspectacle. By rendering the heir of the crown thus early familiar with\r\nthe tender mercies of the Holy Office, it may have been intended to\r\nconciliate his favor to that institution. If such was the object,\r\naccording to the report it signally failed, since the woeful spectacle\r\nleft no other impressions on the mind of the prince than those of\r\nindignation and disgust.\r\n\r\nThe example of Valladolid was soon followed by _autos da fé_ in Granada,\r\nToledo, Seville, Barcelona,--in short, in the twelve capitals in which\r\ntribunals of the Holy Office were established. A second celebration at\r\nValladolid was reserved for the eighth of October in the same year, when\r\nit would be graced by the presence of the sovereign himself. Indeed, as\r\nseveral of the processes had been concluded some months before this\r\nperiod, there is reason to believe that the sacrifice of more than one\r\nof the victims had been postponed, in order to give greater effect to\r\nthe spectacle.[439]\r\n\r\nThe _auto da fé_--\"act of faith\"--was the most imposing, as it was the\r\nmost awful, of the solemnities authorized by the Roman Catholic Church.\r\nIt was intended, somewhat profanely, as has been intimated, to combine\r\nthe pomp of the Roman triumph with the terrors of the day of\r\njudgment.[440] It may remind one quite as much of those bloody festivals\r\nprepared for the entertainment of the Cæsars in the Colisæum. The\r\nreligions import of the _auto da fé_ was intimated by the circumstance\r\nof its being celebrated on a Sunday, or some other holiday of the\r\nChurch. An indulgence for forty days was granted by his holiness to all\r\nwho should be present at the spectacle; as if the appetite for\r\nwitnessing the scenes of human suffering required to be stimulated by a\r\nbounty; that too in Spain, where the amusements were, and still are, of\r\nthe most sanguinary character.\r\n\r\nThe scene for this second _auto da fé_ at Valladolid was the great\r\nsquare in front of the church of St. Francis. At one end a platform was\r\nraised, covered with rich carpeting, on which were ranged the seats of\r\nthe inquisitors, emblazoned with the arms of the Holy Office. Near to\r\nthis was the royal gallery, a private entrance to which secured the\r\ninmates from molestation by the crowd. Opposite to this gallery a large\r\nscaffold was erected, so as to be visible from all parts of the arena,\r\nand was appropriated to the unhappy martyrs who were to suffer in the\r\n_auto_.\r\n\r\nAt six in the morning all the bells in the capital began to toll, and a\r\nsolemn procession was seen to move from the dismal fortress of the\r\nInquisition. In the van marched a body of troops, to secure a free\r\npassage for the procession. Then came the condemned, each attended by\r\ntwo familiars of the Holy Office, and those who were to suffer at the\r\nstake by two friars, in addition, exhorting the heretic to abjure his\r\nerrors. Those admitted to penitence wore a sable dress; while the\r\nunfortunate martyr was enveloped in a loose sack of yellow cloth,--the\r\n_san benito_,--with his head surmounted by a cap of pasteboard of a\r\nconical form, which, together with the cloak, was embroidered with\r\nfigures of flames and of devils fanning and feeding them; all\r\nemblematical of the destiny of the heretic's soul in the world to come,\r\nas well as of his body in the present. Then came the magistrates of the\r\ncity, the judges of the courts, the ecclesiastical orders, and the\r\nnobles of the land on horseback. These were followed by the members of\r\nthe dread tribunal, and the fiscal, bearing a standard of crimson\r\ndamask, on one side of which were displayed the arms of the Inquisition,\r\nand on the other the insignia of its founders, Sixtus the Fifth and\r\nFerdinand the Catholic. Next came a numerous train of familiars, well\r\nmounted, among whom were many gentry of the province, proud to act as\r\nthe body-guard of the Holy Office. The rear was brought up by an immense\r\nconcourse of the common people, stimulated on the present occasion, no\r\ndoubt, by the loyal desire to see their new sovereign, as well as by the\r\nambition to share in the triumphs of the _auto da fé_. The number thus\r\ndrawn together from the capital and the country, far exceeding what was\r\nusual on such occasions, is estimated by one present at full two hundred\r\nthousand.[441]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AUTOS DA FE.]\r\n\r\nAs the multitude defiled into the square, the inquisitors took their\r\nplace on the seats prepared for their reception. The condemned were\r\nconducted to the scaffold, and the royal station was occupied by Philip,\r\nwith the different members of his household. At his side sat his sister,\r\nthe late regent, his son, Don Carlos, his nephew, Alexander Farnese,\r\nseveral foreign ambassadors, and the principal grandees and higher\r\necclesiastics in attendance on the court. It was an august assembly of\r\nthe greatest and the proudest in the land. But the most indifferent\r\nspectator, who had a spark of humanity in his bosom, might have turned\r\nwith feelings of admiration from this array of worldly power, to the\r\npoor martyr, who, with no support but what he drew from within, was\r\nprepared to defy this power, and to lay down his life in vindication of\r\nthe rights of conscience. Some there may have been, in that large\r\nconcourse, who shared in these sentiments. But their number was small\r\nindeed in comparison with those who looked on the wretched victim as the\r\nenemy of God, and his approaching sacrifice as the most glorious triumph\r\nof the Cross.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies began with a sermon, \"the sermon of the faith,\" by the\r\nbishop of Zamora. The subject of it may well be guessed, from the\r\noccasion. It was no doubt plentifully larded with texts of Scripture,\r\nand, unless the preacher departed from the fashion of the time, with\r\npassages from the heathen writers, however much out of place they may\r\nseem in an orthodox discourse.\r\n\r\nWhen the bishop had concluded, the grand-inquisitor administered an oath\r\nto the assembled multitude, who on their knees solemnly swore to defend\r\nthe Inquisition, to maintain the purity of the faith, and to inform\r\nagainst any one who should swerve from it. As Philip repeated an oath of\r\nsimilar import, he suited the action to the word, and, rising from his\r\nseat, drew his sword from its scabbard, as if to announce himself the\r\ndetermined champion of the Holy Office. In the earlier _autos_ of the\r\nMoorish and Jewish infidels, so humiliating an oath had never been\r\nexacted from the sovereign.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the secretary of the tribunal read aloud an instrument\r\nreciting the grounds for the conviction of the prisoners, and the\r\nrespective sentences pronounced against them. Those who were to be\r\nadmitted to penitence, each, as his sentence was proclaimed, knelt down,\r\nand, with his hands on the missal, solemnly abjured his errors, and was\r\nabsolved by the grand-inquisitor. The absolution, however, was not so\r\nentire as to relieve the offender from the penalty of his transgressions\r\nin this world. Some were doomed to perpetual imprisonment in the cells\r\nof the Inquisition, others to lighter penances. All were doomed to the\r\nconfiscation of their property,--a point of too great moment to the\r\nwelfare of the tribunal ever to be omitted. Besides this, in many cases\r\nthe offender, and, by a glaring perversion of justice, his immediate\r\ndescendants, were rendered for ever ineligible to public office of any\r\nkind, and their names branded with perpetual infamy. Thus blighted in\r\nfortune and in character, they were said, in the soft language of the\r\nInquisition, to be _reconciled_.\r\n\r\nAs these unfortunate persons were remanded, under a strong guard, to\r\ntheir prisons, all eyes were turned on the little company of martyrs,\r\nwho, clothed in the ignominious garb of the _san benito_, stood waiting\r\nthe sentence of the judges,--with cords round their necks, and in their\r\nhands a cross, or sometimes an inverted torch, typical of their own\r\nspeedy dissolution. The interest of the spectators was still further\r\nexcited, in the present instance, by the fact that several of these\r\nvictims were not only illustrious for their rank, but yet more so for\r\ntheir talents and virtues. In their haggard looks, their emaciated\r\nforms, and too often, alas! their distorted limbs, it was easy to read\r\nthe story of their sufferings in their long imprisonment, for some of\r\nthem had been confined in the dark cells of the Inquisition much more\r\nthan a year. Yet their countenances, though haggard, far from showing\r\nany sign of weakness or fear, were lighted up with a glow of holy\r\nenthusiasm, as of men prepared to seal their testimony with their blood.\r\n\r\nWhen that part of the process showing the grounds of their conviction\r\nhad been read, the grand-inquisitor consigned them to the hands of the\r\ncorregidor of the city, beseeching him to deal with the prisoners _in\r\nall kindness and mercy_;[442] a honeyed, but most hypocritical phrase,\r\nsince no choice was left to the civil magistrate, but to execute the\r\nterrible sentence of the law against heretics, the preparations for\r\nwhich had been made by him a week before.[443]\r\n\r\nThe whole number of convicts amounted to thirty, of whom sixteen were\r\n_reconciled_, and the remainder _relaxed_ to the secular arm,--in other\r\nwords, turned over to the civil magistrate for execution. There were few\r\nof those thus condemned who, when brought to the stake, did not so far\r\nshrink from the dreadful doom that awaited them as to consent to\r\npurchase a commutation of it by confession before they died; in which\r\ncase they were strangled by the _garrote_, before their bodies were\r\nthrown into the flames.\r\n\r\nOf the present number there were only two whose constancy triumphed to\r\nthe last over the dread of suffering, and who refused to purchase any\r\nmitigation of it by a compromise with conscience. The names of these\r\nmartyrs should be engraven on the record of history.\r\n\r\nOne of them was Don Carlos de Seso, a noble Florentine, who had stood\r\nhigh in the favor of Charles the Fifth. Being united with a lady of rank\r\nin Castile, he removed to that country, and took up his residence in\r\nValladolid. He had become a convert to the Lutheran doctrines, which he\r\nfirst communicated to his own family, and afterwards showed equal zeal\r\nin propagating among the people of Valladolid and its neighborhood. In\r\nshort, there was no man to whose untiring and intrepid labors the cause\r\nof the Reformed religion in Spain was more indebted. He was, of course,\r\na conspicuous mark for the Inquisition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AUTOS DA FE.]\r\n\r\nDuring the fifteen months in which he lay in its gloomy cells, cut off\r\nfrom human sympathy and support, his constancy remained unshaken. The\r\nnight preceding his execution, when his sentence had been announced to\r\nhim, De Seso called for writing materials. It was thought he designed to\r\npropitiate his judges by a full confession of his errors. But the\r\nconfession he made was of another kind. He insisted on the errors of the\r\nRomish Church, and avowed his unshaken trust in the great truths of the\r\nReformation. The document, covering two sheets of paper, is pronounced\r\nby the secretary of the Inquisition to be a composition equally\r\nremarkable for its energy and precision.[444] When led before the royal\r\ngallery, on his way to the place of execution, De Seso pathetically\r\nexclaimed to Philip, \"Is it thus that you allow your innocent subjects\r\nto be persecuted?\" To which the king made the memorable reply, \"If it\r\nwere my own son, I would fetch the wood to burn him, were he such a\r\nwretch as thou art!\" It was certainly a characteristic answer.[445]\r\n\r\nAt the stake De Seso showed the same unshaken constancy, bearing his\r\ntestimony to the truth of the great cause for which he gave up his life.\r\nAs the flames crept slowly around him, he called on the soldiers to heap\r\nup the fagots, that his agonies might be sooner ended; and his\r\nexecutioners, indignant at the obstinacy--the heroism--of the martyr,\r\nwere not slow in obeying his commands.[446]\r\n\r\nThe companion and fellow-sufferer of De Seso was Domingo de Roxas, son\r\nof the marquis de Poza, an unhappy noble, who had seen five of his\r\nfamily, including his eldest son, condemned to various humiliating\r\npenances by the Inquisition for their heretical opinions. This one was\r\nnow to suffer death. De Roxas was a Dominican monk. It is singular that\r\nthis order, from which the ministers of the Holy Office were\r\nparticularly taken, furnished many proselytes to the Reformed religion.\r\nDe Roxas, as was the usage with ecclesiastics, was allowed to retain his\r\nsacerdotal habit until his sentence had been read, when he was degraded\r\nfrom his ecclesiastical rank, his vestments were stripped off one after\r\nanother, and the hideous dress of the _san benito_ thrown over him, amid\r\nthe shouts and derision of the populace. Thus apparelled, he made an\r\nattempt to address the spectators around the scaffold; but no sooner did\r\nhe begin to raise his voice against the errors and cruelties of Rome,\r\nthan Philip indignantly commanded him to be gagged. The gag was a piece\r\nof cleft wood, which, forcibly compressing the tongue, had the\r\nadditional advantage of causing great pain, while it silenced the\r\noffender. Even when he was bound to the stake, the gag, though contrary\r\nto custom, was suffered to remain in the mouth of De Roxas, as if his\r\nenemies dreaded the effects of an eloquence that triumphed over the\r\nanguish of death.[447]\r\n\r\nThe place of execution--the _quemadero_, the burning-place, as it was\r\ncalled--was a spot selected for the purpose without the walls of the\r\ncity.[448] Those who attended an _auto da fé_ were not, therefore,\r\nnecessarily, as is commonly imagined, spectators of the tragic scene\r\nthat concluded it. The great body of the people, and many of higher\r\nrank, no doubt, followed to the place of execution. On this occasion,\r\nthere is reason to think, from the language--somewhat equivocal, it is\r\ntrue--of Philip's biographer, that the monarch chose to testify his\r\ndevotion to the Inquisition by witnessing in person the appalling close\r\nof the drama; while his guards mingled with the menials of the Holy\r\nOffice, and heaped up the fagots round their victims.[449]\r\n\r\nSuch was the cruel exhibition which, under the garb of a religious\r\nfestival, was thought the most fitting ceremonial for welcoming the\r\nCatholic monarch to his dominions! During the whole time of its duration\r\nin the public square, from six in the morning till two in the afternoon,\r\nno symptom of impatience was exhibited by the spectators, and, as may\r\nwell be believed, no sign of sympathy for the sufferers.[450] It would\r\nbe difficult to devise a better school for perverting the moral sense,\r\nand deadening the sensibilities of a nation.[451]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PROSECUTION OF CARRANZA.]\r\n\r\nUnder the royal sanction, the work of persecution now went forward more\r\nbriskly than ever.[452] No calling was too sacred, no rank too high, to\r\nescape the shafts of the informer. In the course of a few years, no\r\nless than nine bishops were compelled to do humiliating penance in some\r\nform or other for heterodox opinions. But the most illustrious victim of\r\nthe Inquisition was Bartolomé Carranzo, archbishop of Toledo. The\r\nprimacy of Spain might be considered as the post of the highest\r\nconsideration in the Roman Catholic Church after the papacy.[453] The\r\nproceedings against this prelate, on the whole, excited more interest\r\nthroughout Christendom than any other case that came before the tribunal\r\nof the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nCarranza, who was of an ancient Castilian family, had early entered a\r\nDominican convent in the suburbs of Guadalajara. His exemplary life, and\r\nhis great parts and learning, recommended him to the favor of Charles\r\nthe Fifth, who appointed him confessor to his son Philip. The emperor\r\nalso sent him to the Council of Trent, where he made a great impression\r\nby his eloquence, as well as by a tract which he published against\r\nplurality of benefices, which, however, excited no little disgust in\r\nmany of his order. On Philip's visit to England to marry Queen Mary,\r\nCarranza accompanied his master, and while in that country he\r\ndistinguished himself by the zeal and ability with which he controverted\r\nthe doctrines of the Protestants. The alacrity, moreover, which he\r\nmanifested in the work of persecution made him generally odious under\r\nthe name of the \"black friar,\"--a name peculiarly appropriate, as it\r\napplied not less to his swarthy complexion than to the garb of his\r\norder. On Philip's return to Flanders, Carranza, who had twice refused a\r\nmitre, was raised--not without strong disinclination on his own part--to\r\nthe archiepiscopal see of Toledo. The \"_nolo episcopari_,\" in this\r\ninstance, seems to have been sincere. It would have been well for him if\r\nit had been effectual. Carranza's elevation to the primacy was the\r\nsource of all his troubles.\r\n\r\nThe hatred of theologians has passed into a proverb; and there would\r\ncertainly seem to be no rancor surpassing that of a Spanish\r\necclesiastic. Among the enemies raised by Carranza's success, the most\r\nimplacable was the grand-inquisitor, Valdés. The archbishop of Seville\r\ncould ill brook that a humble Dominican should be thus raised from the\r\ncloister over the heads of the proud prelacy of Spain. With unwearied\r\npains, such as hate only could induce, he sought out whatever could make\r\nagainst the orthodoxy of the new prelate, whether in his writings or his\r\nconversation. Some plausible ground was afforded for this from the fact,\r\nthat, although Carranza, as his whole life had shown, was devoted to the\r\nRoman Catholic Church, yet his long residence in Protestant countries,\r\nand his familiarity with Protestant works, had given a coloring to his\r\nlanguage, if not to his opinions, which resembled that of the Reformers.\r\nIndeed, Carranza seems to have been much of the same way of thinking\r\nwith Pole, Contarini, Morone, and other illustrious Romanists, whose\r\nliberal natures and wide range of study, had led them to sanction more\r\nthan one of the Lutheran dogmas which were subsequently proscribed by\r\nthe Council of Trent. One charge strongly urged against the primate was\r\nhis assent to the heretical doctrine of justification by faith. In\r\nsupport of this, Father Regla, the confessor, as the reader may\r\nremember, of Charles the Fifth, and a worthy coadjutor of Valdés,\r\nquoted words of consolation employed by Carranza, in his presence, at\r\nthe death-bed of the emperor.[454]\r\n\r\nThe exalted rank of the accused made it necessary for his enemies to\r\nproceed with the greatest caution. Never had the bloodhounds of the\r\nInquisition been set on so noble a quarry. Confident in his own\r\nauthority, the prelate had little reason for distrust. He could not ward\r\noff the blow, for it was an invisible arm stronger than his own that was\r\nraised to smite him. On the twenty-second of August, 1559, the\r\nemissaries of the Holy Office entered the primate's town of Torrelaguna.\r\nThe doors of the episcopal palace were thrown open to the ministers of\r\nthe terrible tribunal. The prelate was dragged from his bed at midnight,\r\nwas hurried into a coach, and while the inhabitants were ordered not so\r\nmuch as to present themselves at the windows, he was conducted, under a\r\nstrong guard, to the prisons of the Inquisition at Valladolid. The\r\narrest of such a person caused a great sensation throughout the country,\r\nbut no attempt was made at a rescue.\r\n\r\nThe primate would have appealed from the Holy Office to the pope, as the\r\nonly power competent to judge him. But he was unwilling to give umbrage\r\nto Philip, who had told him in any extremity to rely on him. The king,\r\nhowever, was still in the Netherlands, where his mind had been\r\npreoccupied, through the archbishop's enemies, with rumors of his\r\ndefection. And the mere imputation of heresy, in this dangerous crisis,\r\nand especially in one whom he had so recently raised to the highest post\r\nin the Spanish church, was enough, not only to efface the recollection\r\nof past services from the mind of Philip, but to turn his favor into\r\naversion. For two years Carranza was suffered to languish in\r\nconfinement, exposed to all the annoyances which the malice of his\r\nenemies could devise. So completely was he dead to the world, that he\r\nknew nothing of a conflagration which consumed more than four hundred of\r\nthe principal houses in Valladolid, till some years after the\r\noccurrence.[455]\r\n\r\nAt length the Council of Trent, sharing the indignation of the rest of\r\nChristendom at the archbishop's protracted imprisonment, called on\r\nPhilip to interpose in his behalf, and to remove the cause to another\r\ntribunal. But the king gave little heed to the remonstrance, which the\r\ninquisitors treated as a presumptuous interference with their authority.\r\n\r\nIn 1566, Pius the Fifth ascended the pontifical throne. He was a man of\r\naustere morals and a most inflexible will. A Dominican, like Carranza,\r\nhe was greatly scandalized by the treatment which the primate had\r\nreceived, and by the shameful length to which his process had been\r\nprotracted. He at once sent his orders to Spain for the removal of the\r\ngrand-inquisitor, Valdés, from office, summoning, at the same time, the\r\ncause and the prisoner before his own tribunal. The bold inquisitor,\r\nloth to lose his prey, would have defied the power of Rome, as he had\r\ndone that of the Council of Trent. Philip remonstrated; but Pius was\r\nfirm, and menaced both king and inquisitor with excommunication. Philip\r\nhad no mind for a second collision with the papal court. In imagination\r\nhe already heard the thunders of the Vatican rolling in the distance,\r\nand threatening soon to break upon his head. After a confinement of now\r\nmore than seven years' duration, the archbishop was sent under a guard\r\nto Rome. He was kindly received by the pontiff, and honorably lodged in\r\nthe castle of St. Angelo, in apartments formerly occupied by the popes\r\nthemselves. But he was still a prisoner.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PROSECUTION OF CARRANZA.]\r\n\r\nPius now set seriously about the examination of Carranza's process. It\r\nwas a tedious business, requiring his holiness to wade through an ocean\r\nof papers, while the progress of the suit was perpetually impeded by\r\nembarrassments thrown in his way by the industrious malice of the\r\ninquisitors. At the end of six years more, Pius was preparing to give\r\nhis judgment, which it was understood would be favorable to Carranza,\r\nwhen, unhappily for the primate, the pontiff died.\r\n\r\nThe Holy Office, stung by the prospect of its failure, now strained\r\nevery nerve to influence the mind of the new pope, Gregory the\r\nThirteenth, to a contrary decision. New testimony was collected, new\r\nglosses were put on the primate's text, and the sanction of the most\r\nlearned Spanish theologians was brought in support of them. At length,\r\nat the end of three years further, the holy father announced his purpose\r\nof giving his final decision. It was done with great circumstance. The\r\npope was seated on his pontifical throne, surrounded by all his\r\ncardinals, prelates, and functionaries of the apostolic chamber. Before\r\nthis august assembly, the archbishop presented himself unsupported and\r\nalone, while no one ventured to salute him. His head was bare. His once\r\nrobust form was bent by infirmity more than by years; and his care-worn\r\nfeatures told of that sickness which arises from hope deferred. He knelt\r\ndown at some distance from the pope, and in this humble attitude\r\nreceived his sentence.\r\n\r\nHe was declared to have imbibed the pernicious doctrines of Luther. The\r\ndecree of the Inquisition prohibiting the use of his catechism was\r\nconfirmed. He was to abjure sixteen propositions found in his writings;\r\nwas suspended from the exercise of his episcopal functions for five\r\nyears, during which time he was to be confined in a convent of his order\r\nat Orvieto; and, finally, he was required to visit seven of the\r\nprincipal churches in Rome, and perform mass there by way of penance.\r\n\r\nThis was the end of eighteen years of doubt, anxiety, and imprisonment.\r\nThe tears streamed down the face of the unhappy man, as he listened to\r\nthe sentence; but he bowed in silent submission to the will of his\r\nsuperior. The very next day he began his work of penance. But nature\r\ncould go no further; and on the second of May, only sixteen days after\r\nhis sentence had been pronounced, Carranza died of a broken heart. The\r\ntriumph of the Inquisition was complete.\r\n\r\nThe pope raised a monument to the memory of the primate, with a pompous\r\ninscription, paying a just tribute to his talents and his scholarship,\r\nendowing him with a full measure of Christian worth, and particularly\r\ncommending the exemplary manner in which he had discharged the high\r\ntrusts reposed in him by his sovereign.[456]\r\n\r\nSuch is the story of Carranza's persecution,--considering the rank of\r\nthe party, the unprecedented length of the process, and the sensation it\r\nexcited throughout Europe, altogether the most remarkable on the records\r\nof the Inquisition.[457] Our sympathy for the archbishop's sufferings\r\nmay be reasonably mitigated by the reflection, that he did but receive\r\nthe measure which he had meted out to others.\r\n\r\nWhile the persecution of Carranza was going on, the fires lighted for\r\nthe Protestants continued to burn with fury in all parts of the country,\r\nuntil at length they gradually slackened and died away, from mere want\r\nof fuel to feed them. The year 1570 may be regarded as the period of the\r\nlast _auto da fé_ in which the Lutherans played a conspicuous part. The\r\nsubsequent celebrations were devoted chiefly to relapsed Jews and\r\nMahometans; and if a Protestant heretic was sometimes added to this\r\nlist, it was \"but as the gleaning of grapes after the vintage is\r\ndone.\"[458]\r\n\r\nNever was there a persecution which did its work more thoroughly. The\r\nblood of the martyr is commonly said to be the seed of the church. But\r\nthe storm of persecution fell as heavily on the Spanish Protestants as\r\nit did on the Albigenses in the thirteenth century; blighting every\r\nliving thing, so that no germ remained for future harvests. Spain might\r\nnow boast that the stain of heresy no longer defiled the hem of her\r\ngarment. But at what a price was this purchased! Not merely by the\r\nsacrifice of the lives and fortunes of a few thousands of the existing\r\ngeneration but by the disastrous consequences entailed for ever on the\r\ncountry. Folded under the dark wing of the Inquisition, Spain was shut\r\nout from the light which in the sixteenth century broke over the rest of\r\nEurope, stimulating the nations to greater enterprise in every\r\ndepartment of knowledge. The genius of the people was rebuked, and their\r\nspirit quenched, under the malignant influence of an eye that never\r\nslumbered, of an unseen arm ever raised to strike. How could there be\r\nfreedom of thought, where there was no freedom of utterance? Or freedom\r\nof utterance, where it was as dangerous to say too little as too much?\r\nFreedom cannot go along with fear. Every way the mind of the Spaniard\r\nwas in fetters.\r\n\r\nHis moral sense was miserably perverted. Men were judged, not by their\r\npractice, but by their professions. Creed became a substitute for\r\nconduct. Difference of faith made a wider gulf of separation than\r\ndifference of race, language, or even interest. Spain no longer formed\r\none of the great brotherhood of Christian nations. An immeasurable\r\nbarrier was raised between that kingdom and the Protestants of Europe.\r\nThe early condition of perpetual warfare with the Arabs who overran the\r\ncountry had led the Spaniards to mingle religion strangely with their\r\npolitics. The effect continued when the cause had ceased. Their wars\r\nwith the European nations became religious wars. In fighting England or\r\nthe Netherlands, they were fighting the enemies of God. It was the same\r\neverywhere. In their contest with the unoffending natives of the New\r\nWorld, they were still battling with the enemies of God. Their wars\r\ntook the character of a perpetual crusade, and were conducted with all\r\nthe ferocity which fanaticism could inspire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RECEPTION OF ISABELLA.]\r\n\r\nThe same dark spirit of fanaticism seems to brood over the national\r\nliterature; even that lighter literature which in other nations is made\r\nup of the festive sallies of wit, or the tender expression of sentiment.\r\nThe greatest geniuses of the nation, the masters of the drama and of the\r\node, while they astonish us by their miracles of invention, show that\r\nthey have too often kindled their inspiration at the altars of the\r\nInquisition.\r\n\r\nDebarred as he was from freedom of speculation, the domain of science\r\nwas closed against the Spaniard. Science looks to perpetual change. It\r\nturns to the past to gather warning, as well as instruction, for the\r\nfuture. Its province is to remove old abuses, to explode old errors, to\r\nunfold new truths. Its condition, in short, is that of progress. But in\r\nSpain, everything not only looked to the past, but rested on the past.\r\nOld abuses gathered respect from their antiquity. Reform was innovation,\r\nand innovation was a crime. Far from progress, all was stationary. The\r\nhand of the Inquisition drew the line which said, \"No further!\" This was\r\nthe limit of human intelligence in Spain.\r\n\r\nThe effect was visible in every department of science,--not in the\r\nspeculative alone, but in the physical and the practical; in the\r\ndeclamatory rant of its theology and ethics, in the childish and\r\nchimerical schemes of its political economists. In every walk were to be\r\nseen the symptoms of premature decrepitude, as the nation clung to the\r\nantiquated systems which the march of civilization in other countries\r\nhad long since effaced. Hence those frantic experiments, so often\r\nrepeated, in the financial administration of the kingdom, which made\r\nSpain the byword of the nations, and which ended in the ruin of trade,\r\nthe prostration of credit, and finally the bankruptcy of the state.--But\r\nwe willingly turn from this sad picture of the destinies of the country\r\nto a more cheerful scene in the history of Philip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPHILIP'S THIRD MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\nReception of Isabella.--Marriage Festivities.--The Queen's Mode of\r\nLife.--The Court removed to Madrid.\r\n\r\n1560.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo soon as Philip should be settled in Spain, it had been arranged that\r\nhis young bride, Elizabeth of France, should cross the Pyrenees. Early\r\nin January, 1560, Elizabeth,--or Isabella, to use the corresponding name\r\nby which she was known to the Spaniards,--under the protection of the\r\nCardinal de Bourbon and some of the French nobility, reached the borders\r\nof Navarre, where she was met by the duke of Infantado, who was to take\r\ncharge of the princess, and escort her to Castile.\r\n\r\nIñigo Lopez de Mendoza, fourth duke of Infantado, was the head of the\r\nmost illustrious house in Castile. He was at this time near seventy\r\nyears of age, having passed most of his life in attendance at court,\r\nwhere he had always occupied the position suited to his high birth and\r\nhis extensive property, which, as his title intimated, lay chiefly in\r\nthe north. He was a fine specimen of the old Castilian hidalgo, and\r\ndisplayed a magnificence in his way of living that became his station.\r\nHe was well educated, for the time; and his fondness for books did not\r\nprevent his excelling in all knightly exercises. He was said to have the\r\nbest library and the best stud of any gentleman in Castile.[459]\r\n\r\nHe appeared on this occasion in great state, accompanied by his\r\nhousehold and his kinsmen, the heads of the noblest families in Spain.\r\nThe duke was attended by some fifty pages, who, in their rich dresses of\r\nsatin and brocade, displayed the gay colors of the house of Mendoza. The\r\nnobles in his train, all suitably mounted, were followed by twenty-five\r\nhundred gentlemen, well equipped, like themselves. So lavish were the\r\nCastilians of that day in the caparisons of their horses, that some of\r\nthese are estimated, without taking into account the jewels with which\r\nthey were garnished, to have cost no less than two thousand ducats![460]\r\nThe same taste is visible at this day in their descendants, especially\r\nin South America and Mexico, where the love of barbaric ornament in the\r\nhousings and caparisons of their steeds is conspicuous among all classes\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nSeveral days were spent in settling the etiquette to be observed before\r\nthe presentation of the duke and his followers to the princess,--a\r\nperilous matter with the Spanish hidalgo. When at length the interview\r\ntook place, the cardinal of Burgos, the duke's brother, opened it by a\r\nformal and rather long address to Isabella, who replied in a tone of\r\neasy gaiety, which, though not undignified, savored much more of the\r\nmanners of her own country than those of Spain.[461] The place of\r\nmeeting was at Roncesvalles,--a name which to the reader of romance may\r\ncall up scenes very different from those presented by the two nations\r\nnow met together in kindly courtesy.[462]\r\n\r\nFrom Roncesvalles the princess proceeded, under the strong escort of the\r\nduke, to his town of Guadalajara in New Castile, where her marriage with\r\nKing Philip was to be solemnized. Great preparations were made by the\r\nloyal citizens for celebrating the event in a manner honorable to their\r\nown master and their future queen. A huge mound, or what might be called\r\na hill, was raised at the entrance of the town, where a grove of natural\r\noaks had been transplanted, amongst which was to be seen abundance of\r\ngame. Isabella was received by the magistrates of the place, and\r\nescorted through the principal streets by a brilliant cavalcade,\r\ncomposed of the great nobility of the court. She was dressed in ermine,\r\nand rode a milk-white palfrey, which she managed with an easy grace that\r\ndelighted the multitude. On one side of her rode the duke of Infantado,\r\nand on the other the cardinal of Burgos. After performing her devotions\r\nat the church, where _Te Deum_ was chanted, she proceeded to the ducal\r\npalace, in which the marriage ceremony was to be performed. On her\r\nentering the court, the princess Joanna came down to receive her\r\nsister-in-law, and, after an affectionate salutation, conducted her to\r\nthe saloon, where Philip, attended by his son, was awaiting his\r\nbride.[463]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RECEPTION OF ISABELLA.]\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that Isabella had seen her destined lord. She now\r\ngazed on him so intently, that he good-humoredly asked her \"if she were\r\nlooking to see if he had any gray hairs in his head?\" The bluntness of\r\nthe question somewhat disconcerted her.[464] Philip's age was not much\r\nless than that at which the first gray hairs made their appearance on\r\nhis father's temples. Yet the discrepancy between the ages of the\r\nparties in the present instance was not greater than often happens in a\r\nroyal union. Isabella was in her fifteenth year,[465] and Philip in his\r\nthirty-fourth.\r\n\r\nFrom all accounts, the lady's youth was her least recommendation.\r\n\"Elizabeth de Valois,\" says Brantôme, who know her well, \"was a true\r\ndaughter of France,--discreet, witty, beautiful, and good, if ever woman\r\nwas so.\"[466] She was well made, and tall of stature, and on this\r\naccount the more admired in Spain, where the women are rarely above the\r\nmiddle height. Her eyes were dark, and her luxuriant tresses, of the\r\nsame dark color, shaded features that were delicately fair.[467] There\r\nwas sweetness mingled with dignity in her deportment, in which Castilian\r\nstateliness seemed to be happily tempered by the vivacity of her own\r\nnation. \"So attractive was she,\" continues the gallant old courtier,\r\n\"that no cavalier durst look on her long, for fear of losing his heart,\r\nwhich in that jealous court might have proved the loss of his\r\nlife.\"[468]\r\n\r\nSome of the chroniclers notice a shade of melancholy as visible on\r\nIsabella's features, which they refer to the comparison the young bride\r\nwas naturally led to make between her own lord and his son, the prince\r\nof Asturias, for whom her hand had been originally intended.[469] But\r\nthe daughter of Catherine de Medicis, they are careful to add, had been\r\ntoo well trained, from her cradle, not to know how to disguise her\r\nfeelings. Don Carlos had one advantage over his father, in his youth;\r\nthough, in this respect, since he was but a boy of fourteen, he might be\r\nthought to fall as much too short of the suitable age as the king\r\nexceeded it. It is also intimated by the same gossiping writers, that\r\nfrom this hour of their meeting, touched by the charms of his\r\nstep-mother, the prince nourished a secret feeling of resentment against\r\nhis father, who had thus come between him and his beautiful\r\nbetrothed.[470] It is this light gossip of the chroniclers that has\r\nfurnished the romancers of later ages with the flimsy materials for that\r\nweb of fiction, which displays in such glowing colors the loves of\r\nCarlos and Isabella. I shall have occasion to return to this subject\r\nwhen treating of the fate of this unhappy prince.\r\n\r\nWhen the nuptials were concluded, the good people of Guadalajara\r\ntestified their loyalty by all kinds of festivities in honor of the\r\nevent,--by fireworks, music, and dancing. The fountains flowed with\r\ngenerous liquor. Tables were spread in the public squares, laden with\r\ngood cheer, and freely open to all. In the evening, the _regidores_ of\r\nthe town, to the number of fifty or more, presented themselves before\r\nthe king and queen. They were dressed in their gaudy liveries of crimson\r\nand yellow velvet, and each one of these functionaries bore a napkin on\r\nhis arm, while he carried a plate of sweetmeats, which he presented to\r\nthe royal pair and the ladies of the court. The following morning Philip\r\nand his consort left the hospitable walls of Guadalajara, and set out\r\nwith their whole suite for Toledo. At parting, the duke of Infantado\r\nmade the queen and her ladies presents of jewels, lace, and other rich\r\narticles of dress; and the sovereigns took leave of their noble host,\r\nwell pleased with the princely entertainment he had given them.[471]\r\n\r\nAt Toledo preparations were made for the reception of Philip and\r\nIsabella in a style worthy of the renown of that ancient capital of the\r\nVisigoths. In the broad _vega_ before the city, three thousand of the\r\nold Spanish infantry engaged in a mock encounter with a body of Moorish\r\ncavalry, having their uniforms and caparisons fancifully trimmed and\r\nornamented in the Arabesque fashion. Then followed various national\r\ndances by beautiful maidens of Toledo, dances of the Gypsies, and the\r\nold Spanish \"war-dance of the swords.\"[472]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARRIAGE FESTIVITIES.]\r\n\r\nOn entering the gates, the royal pair were welcomed by the municipality\r\nof the city, who supported a canopy of cloth of gold over the heads of\r\nthe king and queen, emblazoned with their ciphers. A procession was\r\nformed, consisting of the principal magistrates, the members of the\r\nmilitary orders, the officers of the Inquisition,--for Toledo was one of\r\nthe principal stations of the secret tribunal,--and, lastly, the chief\r\nnobles of the court. In the cavalcade might be discerned the iron form\r\nof the duke of Alva, and his more courtly rival, Ruy Gomez de Silva,\r\ncount of Melito,--the two nobles highest in the royal confidence.\r\nTriumphal arches, ornamented with quaint devices and emblematical\r\nfigures from ancient mythology, were thrown across the streets, which\r\nwere filled with shouting multitudes. Gay wreaths of flowers and\r\nflaunting streamers adorned the verandas and balconies, which were\r\ncrowded with spectators of both sexes in their holiday attire, making a\r\ndisplay of gaudy colors that reminds an old chronicler of the richly\r\ntinted tapestries and carpetings of Flanders.[473] In this royal state,\r\nthe new-married pair moved along the streets towards the great\r\ncathedral; and after paying their devotions at its venerable shrine,\r\nthey repaired to the _alcazar_,--the palace-fortress of Toledo.\r\n\r\nFor some weeks, during which the sovereigns remained in the capital,\r\nthere was a general jubilee.[474] All the national games of Spain were\r\nexhibited to the young queen; the bull-fight, the Moorish sport of the\r\n_cañas_, or tilt of reeds, and tournaments on horseback and on foot, in\r\nboth of which Philip often showed himself armed _cap-à-pie_ in the\r\nlists, and did his _devoir_ in the presence of his fair bride, as became\r\na loyal knight. Another show, which might have been better reserved for\r\na less joyous occasion, was exhibited to Isabella. As the court and the\r\ncortes were drawn together in Toledo, the Holy Office took the occasion\r\nto celebrate an _auto da fé_, which, from the number of the victims and\r\nquality of the spectators, was the most imposing spectacle of the kind\r\never witnessed in that capital.\r\n\r\nNo country in Europe has so distinct an individuality as Spain; shown\r\nnot merely in the character of the inhabitants, but in the smallest\r\ndetails of life,--in their national games, their dress, their social\r\nusages. The tenacity with which the people have clung to these amidst\r\nall the changes of dynasties and laws is truly admirable. Separated by\r\ntheir mountain barrier from the central and eastern parts of Europe, and\r\nduring the greater part of their existence brought into contact with\r\nOriental forms of civilization, the Spaniards have been but little\r\nexposed to those influences which have given a homogeneous complexion to\r\nthe other nations of Christendom. The system under which they have been\r\ntrained is too peculiar to be much affected by these influences, and the\r\nideas transmitted from their ancestors are too deeply settled in their\r\nminds to be easily disturbed. The present in Spain is but the mirror of\r\nthe past, in other countries fashions become antiquated, old errors\r\nexploded, early tastes reformed. Not so in the Peninsula. The traveller\r\nhas only to cross the Pyrenees to find himself a contemporary of the\r\nsixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe festivities of the court were suddenly terminated by the illness of\r\nIsabella, who was attacked by the small-pox. Her life was in no danger;\r\nbut great fears were entertained lest the envious disease should prove\r\nfatal to her beauty. Her mother, Catherine de Medicis, had great\r\napprehensions on this point; and couriers crossed the Pyrenees\r\nfrequently, during the queen's illness, bringing prescriptions--some of\r\nthem rather extraordinary--from the French doctors for preventing the\r\nravages of the disorder.[475] Whether it was by reason of these\r\nnostrums, or her own excellent constitution, the queen was fortunate\r\nenough to escape from the sick-room without a scar.\r\n\r\nPhilip seems to have had much reason to be contented not only with the\r\nperson, but the disposition, of his wife. As her marriage had formed one\r\nof the articles in the treaty with France, she was called by the\r\nSpaniards _Isabel de la Paz_,--\"Isabella of the Peace.\" Her own\r\ncountrymen no less fondly styled her \"the Olive-Branch of\r\nPeace,\"--intimating the sweetness of her disposition.[476] In this\r\nrespect she may be thought to have formed a contrast to Philip's former\r\nwife, Mary of England; at least after sickness and misfortune had done\r\ntheir work upon that queen's temper, in the latter part of her life.\r\n\r\nIf Isabella was not a scholar, like Mary, she at least was well\r\ninstructed for the time, and was fond of reading, especially poetry. She\r\nhad a ready apprehension, and learned in a short time to speak the\r\nCastilian with tolerable fluency, while there was something pleasing in\r\nher foreign accent, that made her pronunciation the more interesting.\r\nShe accommodated herself so well to the usages of her adopted nation,\r\nthat she soon won the hearts of the Spaniards. \"No queen of Castile,\"\r\nsays the loyal Brantôme, \"with due deference to Isabella the Catholic,\r\nwas ever so popular in the country.\" When she went abroad, it was\r\nusually with her face uncovered, after the manner of her countrywomen.\r\nThe press was always great around her whenever she appeared in public,\r\nand happy was the man who could approach so near as to get a glimpse of\r\nher beautiful countenance.[477]\r\n\r\nYet Isabella never forgot the land of her birth; and such of her\r\ncountrymen as visited the Castilian court were received by her with\r\ndistinguished courtesy. She brought along with her in her train to\r\nCastile several French ladies of rank, as her maids of honor. But a\r\nrivalry soon grew up between them and the Spanish ladies in the palace,\r\nwhich compelled the queen, after she had in vain attempted to reconcile\r\nthe parties, to send back most of her own countrywomen. In doing so, she\r\nwas careful to provide them with generous marriage portions.[478]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE QUEEN'S MODE OF LIFE.]\r\n\r\nThe queen maintained great state in her household, as was Philip's wish,\r\nwho seems to have lavished on his lovely consort those attentions for\r\nwhich the unfortunate Mary Tudor had pined in vain. Besides a rare\r\ndisplay of jewels, Isabella's wardrobe was exceedingly rich. Few of her\r\nrobes cost less than three or four hundred crowns each,--a great sum for\r\nthe time. Like her namesake and contemporary, Elizabeth of England, she\r\nrarely wore the same dress twice. But she gave away the discarded suit\r\nto her attendants,[479] unlike in this to the English queen, who hoarded\r\nup her wardrobe so carefully, that at her death it must have displayed\r\nevery fashion of her reign. Brantôme, who, both as a Frenchman and as\r\none who had seen the queen often in the court of Castile, may be\r\nconsidered a judge in the matter, dwells with rapture on the elegance of\r\nher costume, the matchless taste in its arrangement, and the perfection\r\nof her _coiffure_.\r\n\r\nA manuscript of the time, by an eye-witness, gives a few particulars\r\nrespecting her manner of living, in which some readers may take an\r\ninterest. Among the persons connected with the queen's establishment,\r\nthe writer mentions her confessor, her almoner, and four physicians. The\r\nmedical art seems to have been always held in high repute in Spain,\r\nthough in no country, considering the empirical character of its\r\nprofessors, with so little reason. At dinner the queen was usually\r\nattended by some thirty of her ladies. Two of them, singularly enough as\r\nit may seem to us, performed the office of carvers. Another served as\r\ncupbearer, and stood by her majesty's chair. The rest of her attendants\r\nstood round the apartment, conversing with their gallants, who, in a\r\nstyle to which she had not been used in the French courts, kept their\r\nheads covered during the repast. \"They were there,\" they said, \"not to\r\nwait on the queen, but her ladies.\" After her solitary meal was over,\r\nIsabella retired with her attendants to her chamber, where, with the aid\r\nof music, and such mirth as the buffoons and jesters of the palace could\r\nafford, she made shift to pass the evening.[480]\r\n\r\nSuch is the portrait which her contemporaries have left us of Elizabeth\r\nof France; and such the accounts of her popularity with the nation, and\r\nthe state maintained in her establishment. Well might Brantôme sadly\r\nexclaim, \"Alas! what did it all avail?\" A few brief years only were to\r\npass away before this spoiled child of fortune, the delight of the\r\nmonarch, the ornament and pride of the court, was to exchange the pomps\r\nand glories of her royal state for the dark chambers of the Escorial.\r\n\r\nFrom Toledo the court proceeded to Valladolid, long the favourite\r\nresidence of the Castilian princes, though not the acknowledged capital\r\nof the country. Indeed there was no city, since the time of the\r\nVisigoths, that could positively claim that preëminence. This honor was\r\nreserved for Madrid, which became the established residence of the court\r\nunder Philip, who in this but carried out the ideas of his father,\r\nCharles the Fifth.\r\n\r\nThe emperor had passed much time in this place, where, strange to say,\r\nthe chief recommendation to him seems to have been the climate. Situated\r\non a broad expanse of table-land, at an elevation of twenty-four hundred\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, the brisk and rarefied atmosphere of\r\nMadrid proved favorable to Charles's health. It preserved him, in\r\nparticular, from attacks of the fever and ague, which racked his\r\nconstitution almost as much as the gout. In the ancient _alcazar_ of the\r\nMoors he found a stately residence, which he made commodious by various\r\nalterations. Philip extended these improvements. He added new\r\napartments, and spent much money in enlarging and embellishing the old\r\nones. The ceilings were gilded and richly carved. The walls were hung\r\nwith tapestries, and the saloons and galleries decorated with sculpture\r\nand with paintings,--many of them the productions of native artists, the\r\nfirst disciples of a school which was one day to rival the great masters\r\nof Italy. Extensive grounds were also laid out around the palace, and a\r\npark was formed, which in time came to be covered with a growth of noble\r\ntrees, and well stocked with game. The _alcazar_, thus improved, became\r\na fitting residence for the sovereign of Spain. Indeed, if we may trust\r\nthe magnificent vaunt of a contemporary, it was \"allowed by foreigners\r\nto be the rarest thing of the kind possessed by any monarch in\r\nChristendom.\"[481] It continued to be the abode of the Spanish princes\r\nuntil, in 1734, in the reign of Philip the Fifth, the building was\r\ndestroyed by a fire, which lasted nearly a week. But it rose like a\r\nphoenix from its ashes; and a new palace was raised on the site of the\r\nold one, of still larger dimensions, presenting in the beauty of its\r\nmaterials as well as of its execution one of the noblest monuments of\r\nthe architecture of the eighteenth century.[482]\r\n\r\nHaving completed his arrangements, Philip established his residence at\r\nMadrid in 1563. The town then contained about twelve thousand\r\ninhabitants. Under the forcing atmosphere of a court, the population\r\nrose by the end of his long reign to three hundred thousand,[483]--a\r\nnumber which it has probably not since exceeded. The accommodations in\r\nthe capital kept pace with the increase of population. Everything was\r\nbuilt for duration. Instead of flimsy houses that might serve for a\r\ntemporary residence, the streets were lined with strong and substantial\r\nedifices. Under the royal patronage public works on a liberal scale were\r\nexecuted. Madrid was ornamented with bridges, aqueducts, hospitals, the\r\nMuseum, the Armory,--stately structures which even now challenge our\r\nadmiration, not less by the excellence of their designs than by the\r\nrichness of their collections and the enlightened taste which they infer\r\nat this early period.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE COURT REMOVED TO MADRID.]\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of its inhabitants, indeed we may say of the nation,\r\nMadrid surpassed, not only every other city in the country, but in\r\nChristendom. \"There is but one Madrid,\" says the Spanish proverb.[484]\r\n\"When Madrid is the theme, the world listens in silence!\"[485] In a\r\nsimilar key, the old Castilian writers celebrate the glories of their\r\ncapital,--the nursery of wit, genius, and gallantry,--and expatiate on\r\nthe temperature of a climate propitious alike to the beauty of the women\r\nand the bravery of the men.[486]\r\n\r\nYet, with all this lofty panegyric, the foreigner is apt to see things\r\nthrough a very different medium from that through which they are seen by\r\nthe patriotic eye of the native. The traveller to Madrid finds little to\r\npraise in a situation where the keen winds from the mountains come laden\r\nwith disease, and where the subtle atmosphere, to use one of the\r\nnational proverbs, that can hardly put out a candle, will extinguish the\r\nlife of a man;[487] where the capital, insulated in the midst of a\r\ndreary expanse of desert, seems to be cut off from sympathy, if not from\r\nintercourse, with the provinces;[488] and where, instead of a great\r\nriver that might open to it a commerce with distant quarters of the\r\nglobe, it is washed only by a stream,--\"the far-famed Manzanares,\"--the\r\nbed of which in summer is a barren watercourse. The traveller may well\r\ndoubt whether the fanciful advantage, so much vaunted, of being the\r\ncentre of Spain, is sufficient to compensate the manifold evils of such\r\na position, and even whether those are far from truth who find in this\r\nposition one of the many causes of the decline of the national\r\nprosperity.[489]\r\n\r\nA full experience of the inconveniences of the site of the capital led\r\nCharles the Third to contemplate its removal to Seville. But it was too\r\nlate. Madrid had been too long, in the Castilian boast, \"the only court\r\nin the world,\"[490]--the focus to which converged talent, fashion, and\r\nwealth from all quarters of the country. Too many patriotic associations\r\nhad gathered round it to warrant its desertion; and, in spite of its\r\nlocal disadvantages, the capital planted by Philip the Second continued\r\nto remain, as it will probably ever remain, the capital of the Spanish\r\nmonarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nDISCONTENT IN THE NETHERLANDS.\r\n\r\nThe Reformation.--Its Progress in the Netherlands.--General\r\nDiscontent.--William of Orange.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe middle of the sixteenth century presented one of those crises which\r\nhave occurred at long intervals in the history of Europe, when the\r\ncourse of events has had a permanent influence on the destiny of\r\nnations. Scarcely forty years had elapsed since Luther had thrown down\r\nthe gauntlet to the Vatican, by publicly burning the papal bull at\r\nWittenberg. Since that time, his doctrines had been received in Denmark\r\nand Sweden. In England, after a state of vacillation for three reigns,\r\nProtestantism, in the peculiar form which it still wears, was become the\r\nestablished religion of the state. The fiery cross had gone round over\r\nthe hills and valleys of Scotland, and thousands and tens of thousands\r\nhad gathered to hear the word of life from the lips of Knox. The\r\ndoctrines of Luther were spread over the northern parts of Germany, and\r\nfreedom of worship was finally guarantied there, by the treaty of\r\nPassau. The Low Countries were the \"debatable land,\" on which the\r\nvarious sects of Reformers, the Lutheran, the Calvinist, the English\r\nProtestant, contended for mastery with the established church. Calvinism\r\nwas embraced by some of the cantons of Switzerland, and at Geneva its\r\ngreat apostle had fixed his head-quarters. His doctrines were widely\r\ncirculated through France, till the divided nation was preparing to\r\nplunge into that worst of all wars, in which the hand of brother is\r\nraised against brother. The cry of reform had even passed the Alps, and\r\nwas heard under the walls of the Vatican. It had crossed the Pyrenees.\r\nThe king of Navarre declared himself a Protestant; and the spirit of the\r\nReformation had secretly insinuated itself into Spain, and taken hold,\r\nas we have seen, of the middle and southern provinces of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nA contemporary of the period, who reflected on the onward march of the\r\nnew religion over every obstacle in its path, who had seen it gather\r\nunder its banners states and nations once the most loyal and potent\r\nvassals of Rome, would have had little reason to doubt that, before the\r\nend of the century, the Reform would have extended its sway over the\r\nwhole of Christendom. Fortunately for Catholicism, the most powerful\r\nempire in Europe was in the hands of a prince who was devoted with his\r\nwhole soul to the interests of the Church. Philip the Second understood\r\nthe importance of his position. His whole life proves that he felt it to\r\nbe his especial mission to employ his great resources to restore the\r\ntottering fortunes of Catholicism, and stay the progress of the torrent\r\nwhich was sweeping away every landmark of the primitive faith.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the manner in which he crushed the efforts of the\r\nProtestants in Spain. This was the first severe blow struck at the\r\nReformation. Its consequences cannot well be exaggerated; not the\r\nimmediate results, which would have been little without the subsequent\r\nreforms and increased activity of the Church of Rome itself. But the\r\nmoral influence of such a blow, when the minds of men had been depressed\r\nby a long series of reverses, is not to be estimated. In view of this,\r\none of the most eminent Roman Catholic writers does not hesitate to\r\nremark, that \"the power and abilities of Philip the Second afforded a\r\ncounterpoise to the Protestant cause, which prevented it from making\r\nitself master of Europe.\"[491] The blow was struck; and from this\r\nperiod little beyond its present conquests was to be gained for the\r\ncause of the Reformation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: REFORMATION IN THE NETHERLANDS.]\r\n\r\nIt was not to be expected that Philip, after having exterminated heresy\r\nin one part of his dominions, should tolerate its existence in any\r\nother, least of all, in a country so important as the Netherlands. Yet a\r\nlittle reflection might have satisfied him that the same system of\r\nmeasures could hardly be applied with a prospect of success to two\r\ncountries so differently situated as Spain and the Netherlands. The\r\nRomish faith may be said to have entered into the being of the Spaniard.\r\nIt was not merely cherished as a form of religion, but as a principle of\r\nhonor. It was part of the national history. For eight centuries the\r\nSpaniard had been fighting at home the battles of the Church. Nearly\r\nevery inch of soil in his own country was won by arms from the infidel.\r\nHis wars, as I have more than once had occasion to remark, were all wars\r\nof religion. He carried the same spirit across the waters. There he was\r\nstill fighting the infidel. His life was one long crusade. How could\r\nthis champion of the Church desert her in her utmost need?\r\n\r\nWith this predisposition, it was easy for Philip to enforce obedience in\r\na people naturally the most loyal to their princes, to whom, moreover,\r\nsince the fatal war of the _Comunidades_, they had been accustomed to\r\npay an almost Oriental submission. Intrenched behind the wall of the\r\nPyrenees, Spain, we must bear in mind, felt little of the great shock\r\nwhich was convulsing France and the other states of Europe; and with the\r\naid of so formidable an engine as the Inquisition, it was easy to\r\nexterminate, before they could take root, such seeds of heresy as had\r\nbeen borne by the storm across the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Netherlands, on the other hand, lay like a valley among the hills,\r\nwhich drinks in all the waters of the surrounding country. They were a\r\ncommon reservoir for the various opinions which agitated the nations on\r\ntheir borders. On the south were the Lutherans of Germany. The French\r\nHuguenots pressed them on the west; and by the ocean they held\r\ncommunication with England and the nations of the Baltic. The soldier\r\nquartered on their territory, the seaman who visited their shores, the\r\ntrader who trafficked in their towns, brought with them different forms\r\nof the new religion. Books from France and from Germany circulated\r\nwidely among a people, nearly all of whom, as we have seen, were able to\r\nread.\r\n\r\nThe new doctrines were discussed by men accustomed to think and act for\r\nthemselves. Freedom of speculation on religious topics soon extended to\r\npolitical. It was the natural tendency of reform. The same spirit of\r\nfree inquiry which attacked the foundations of unity of faith, stood\r\nready next to assail those of unity of government; and men began boldly\r\nto criticize the rights of kings and the duties of subjects.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of independence was fostered by the institutions of the\r\ncountry. The provinces of the Netherlands, if not republican in form,\r\nwere filled with the spirit of republics. In many of their features they\r\ncall to mind the free states of Italy in the Middle Ages. Under the\r\npetty princes who ruled over them in early days, they had obtained\r\ncharters, as we have seen, which secured a certain degree of\r\nconstitutional freedom. The province of Brabant, above all, gloried in\r\nits \"_Joyeuse Entrée_,\" which guarantied privileges and immunities of a\r\nmore liberal character than those possessed by the other states of the\r\nNetherlands. When the provinces passed at length under the sceptre of a\r\nsingle sovereign, he lived at a distance, and the government was\r\ncommitted to a viceroy. Since their connection with Spain, the\r\nadministration had been for the most part in the hands of a woman; and\r\nthe delegated authority of a woman pressed but lightly on the\r\nindependent temper of the Flemings.\r\n\r\nYet Charles the Fifth, as we have seen, partial as he was to his\r\ncountrymen in the Netherlands, could ill brook their audacious spirit,\r\nand made vigorous efforts to repress it. But his zeal for the spiritual\r\nwelfare of his people never led him to overlook their material\r\ninterests. He had no design by his punishments to cripple their\r\nstrength, much less to urge them to extremity. When the regent, Mary of\r\nHungary, his sister, warned him that his laws bore too heavily on the\r\npeople to be endured, he was careful to mitigate their severity. His\r\nedicts in the name of religion were, indeed, written in blood. But the\r\nfrequency of their repetition shows, as already remarked, the imperfect\r\nmanner in which they were executed. This was still further proved by the\r\nprosperous condition of the people, the flourishing aspect of the\r\nvarious branches of industry, and the great enterprises to facilitate\r\ncommercial intercourse and foster the activity of the country. At the\r\nclose of Charles's reign, or rather at the commencement of his\r\nsuccessor's, in 1560, was completed the grand canal extending from\r\nAntwerp to Brussels, the construction of which had consumed thirty\r\nyears, and one million eight hundred thousand florins.[492] Such a work,\r\nat such a period,--the fruit, not of royal patronage, but of the public\r\nspirit of the citizens,--is evidence both of large resources and of\r\nwisdom in the direction of them. In this state of things, it is not\r\nsurprising that the Flemings, feeling their own strength, should have\r\nassumed a free and independent tone little grateful to the ear of a\r\nsovereign. So far had this spirit of liberty or licence, as it was\r\ntermed, increased, in the latter part of the emperor's reign, that the\r\nRegent Mary, when her brother abdicated, chose also to resign,\r\ndeclaring, in a letter to him, that \"she would not continue to live\r\nwith, much less to reign over, a people whose manners had undergone such\r\na change,--in whom respect for God and man seemed no longer to\r\nexist.\"[493]\r\n\r\nA philosopher who should have contemplated at that day the condition of\r\nthe country, and the civilization at which it had arrived, might feel\r\nsatisfied that a system of toleration in religious matters would be the\r\none best suited to the genius of the people and the character of their\r\ninstitutions. But Philip was no philosopher; and toleration was a virtue\r\nnot understood, at that time, by Calvinist any more than by Catholic.\r\nThe question, therefore, is not whether the end he proposed was the best\r\none;--on this, few at the present day will differ;--but whether Philip\r\ntook the best means for effecting that end. This is the point of view\r\nfrom which his conduct in the Netherlands should be criticized.\r\n\r\nHere, in the outset, he seems to have fallen into a capital error, by\r\ncommitting so large a share in the government to the hands of a\r\nforeigner,--Granvelle. The country was filled with nobles, some of them\r\nmen of the highest birth, whose ancestors were associated with the most\r\nstirring national recollections, and who were endeared, moreover, to\r\ntheir countrymen by their own services. To several of these Philip\r\nhimself was under no slight obligations for the aid they had afforded\r\nhim in the late war,--on the fields of Gravelines and St. Quentin, and\r\nin the negotiation of the treaty which closed his hostilities with\r\nFrance. It was hardly to be expected that these proud nobles, conscious\r\nof their superior claims, and accustomed to so much authority and\r\ndeference in their own land, would tamely submit to the control of a\r\nstranger, a man of obscure family, like his father indebted for his\r\nelevation to the royal favor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DISCONTENT IN THE NETHERLANDS.]\r\n\r\nBesides these great lords, there was a numerous aristocracy, inferior\r\nnobles and cavaliers, many of whom had served under the standard of\r\nCharles in his long wars. They there formed those formidable companies\r\nof _ordonnance_, whose fame perhaps stood higher than that of any other\r\ncorps of the imperial cavalry. The situation of these men, now\r\ndisbanded, and, with their roving military habits, hanging loosely on\r\nthe country, has been compared by a modern author to that which, on the\r\naccession of the Bourbons, was occupied by the soldiers whom Napoleon\r\nhad so often led to victory.[494] To add to their restlessness, many of\r\nthese, as well as of the higher nobility, were embarrassed by debts\r\ncontracted in their campaigns, or by too ambitious expenditure at home,\r\nespecially in rivalry with the ostentatious Spaniard. \"The Flemish\r\nnobles,\" says a writer of the time, \"were too many of them oppressed by\r\nheavy debts and the payment of exorbitant interest. They spent twice as\r\nmuch as they were worth on their palaces, furniture, troops of\r\nretainers, costly liveries, their banquets and sumptuous entertainments\r\nof every description,--in fine, in every form of luxury and superfluity\r\nthat could be devised. Thus discontent became prevalent through the\r\ncountry, and men anxiously looked forward to some change.\"[495]\r\n\r\nStill another element of discontent, and one that extended to all\r\nclasses, was antipathy to the Spaniards. It had not been easy to repress\r\nthis even under the rule of Charles the Fifth, who had shown such\r\nmanifest preference for his Flemish subjects. But now it was more\r\ndecidedly called out, under a monarch, whose sympathies lay altogether\r\non the side of their rivals. No doubt this popular sentiment is to be\r\nexplained partly by the contrast afforded by the characters of the two\r\nnations, so great as hardly to afford a point of contact between them.\r\nBut it may be fairly charged, to a great extent, on the Spaniards\r\nthemselves, who, while they displayed many noble and magnanimous traits\r\nat home, seemed desirous to exhibit only the repulsive side of their\r\ncharacter to the eye of the stranger. Cold and impenetrable, assuming an\r\narrogant tone of superiority over every other nation, in whatever land\r\nit was their destiny to be cast, England, Italy, or the Netherlands, as\r\nallies or as enemies, we find the Spaniards of that day equally\r\ndetested. Brought with them, as the people of the Netherlands were,\r\nunder a common sceptre, a spirit of comparison and rivalry grew up,\r\nwhich induced a thousand causes of irritation.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty was still further increased by the condition of the\r\nneighboring countries, where the minds of the inhabitants were now in\r\nthe highest state of fermentation in matters of religion. In short, the\r\natmosphere seemed everywhere to be in that highly electrified condition\r\nwhich bodes the coming tempest. In this critical state of things, it was\r\nclear that it was only by a most careful and considerate policy that\r\nharmony could be maintained in the Netherlands; a policy manifesting\r\nalike tenderness for the feelings of the nation and respect for its\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nHaving thus shown the general aspect of things when the duchess of Parma\r\nentered on her regency, towards the close of 1559, it is time to go\r\nforward with the narrative of the prominent events which led to the War\r\nof the Revolution.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that Philip, on leaving the country, lodged the\r\nadministration nominally in three councils, although in truth it was on\r\nthe council of state that the weight of government actually rested. Even\r\nhere the nobles who composed it were of little account in matters of\r\nreal importance, which were reserved for a _consulta_, consisting,\r\nbesides the regent, of Granvelle, Count Barlaimont, and the learned\r\njurist Viglius. As the last two were altogether devoted to Granvelle,\r\nand the regent was instructed to defer greatly to his judgment, the\r\ngovernment of the Netherlands may be said to have been virtually\r\ndeposited in the hands of the bishop of Arras.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the Flemish nobles in the council of state, and indeed in\r\nthe country, taking into view their rank, fortune, and public services,\r\nstood Count Egmont and the prince of Orange. I have already given some\r\naccount of the former, and the reader has seen the important part which\r\nhe took in the great victories of Gravelines and St. Quentin. To the\r\nprince of Orange Philip had also been indebted for his counsel in\r\nconducting the war, and still more for the aid which he had afforded in\r\nthe negotiations for peace. It will be proper, before going further, to\r\ngive the reader some particulars of this celebrated man, the great\r\nleader in the war of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nWilliam, prince of Orange, was born at Dillenburg, in the German duchy\r\nof Nassau, on the twenty-fifth of April, 1533. He was descended from a\r\nhouse, one of whose branches had given an emperor to Germany; and\r\nWilliam's own ancestors were distinguished by the employments they had\r\nheld, and the services they had rendered, both in Germany and the Low\r\nCountries. It was a proud vaunt of his, that Philip was under larger\r\nobligations to him than he to Philip; and that, but for the house of\r\nNassau, the king of Spain would not be able to write as many titles as\r\nhe now did after his name.[496]\r\n\r\nWhen eleven years old, by the death of his cousin René he came into\r\npossession of a large domain in Holland, and a still larger property in\r\nBrabant, where he held the title of Lord of Breda. To these was added,\r\nthe splendid inheritance of Chalons, and of the principality of Orange;\r\nwhich, however, situated at a distance, in the heart of France, might\r\nseem to be held by a somewhat precarious tenure.\r\n\r\nWilliam's parents were both Lutherans, and in their faith he was\r\neducated. But Charles saw with displeasure the false direction thus\r\ngiven to one who at a future day was to occupy so distinguished a\r\nposition among his Flemish vassals. With the consent of his parents, the\r\nchild, in his twelfth year, was removed to Brussels, to be brought up in\r\nthe family of the emperor's sister, the Regent Mary of Hungary. However\r\ntheir consent to this step may be explained, it certainly seems that\r\ntheir zeal for the spiritual welfare of their son was not such as to\r\nstand in the way of his temporal. In the family of the regent the youth\r\nwas bred a Catholic, while in all respects he received an education\r\nsuited to his rank.[497] It is an interesting fact, that his preceptor\r\nwas a younger brother of Granvelle,--the man with whom William was\r\nafterwards to be placed in an attitude of such bitter hostility.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WILLIAM OF ORANGE.]\r\n\r\nWhen fifteen years of age, the prince was taken into the imperial\r\nhousehold, and became the page of Charles the Fifth. The emperor was not\r\nslow in discerning the extraordinary qualities of the youth; and he\r\nshowed it by intrusting him, as he grew older, with various important\r\ncommissions. He was accompanied by the prince on his military\r\nexpeditions, and Charles gave a remarkable proof of his confidence in\r\nhis capacity, by raising him, at the age of twenty-two, over the heads\r\nof veteran officers, and giving him the command of the imperial forces\r\nengaged in the siege of Marienburg. During the six months that William\r\nwas in command, they were still occupied with this siege, and with the\r\nconstruction of a fortress for the protection of Flanders. There was\r\nlittle room for military display. But the troops were in want of food\r\nand of money, and their young commander's conduct under these\r\nembarrassments was such as to vindicate the wisdom of his appointment.\r\nCharles afterwards employed him on several diplomatic missions,--a more\r\ncongenial field for the exercise of his talents, which appear to have\r\nbeen better suited to civil than to military affairs.\r\n\r\nThe emperor's regard for the prince seems to have increased with his\r\nyears, and he gave public proof of it, in the last hour of his reign, by\r\nleaning on William's shoulder at the time of his abdication, when he\r\nmade his parting address to the states of the Netherlands. He showed\r\nthis still further by selecting him for the honorable mission of bearing\r\nthe imperial crown to Ferdinand.\r\n\r\nOn his abdication, Charles earnestly commended William to his successor.\r\nPhilip profited by his services in the beginning of his reign, when the\r\nprince of Orange, who had followed him in the French war, was made one\r\nof the four plenipotentiaries for negotiating the treaty of\r\nCateau-Cambresis, for the execution of which he remained as one of the\r\nhostages in France.\r\n\r\nWhile at the court of Henry the Second, it will be remembered, the\r\nprince became acquainted with the secret designs of the French and\r\nSpanish monarchs against the Protestants in their dominions; and he\r\nresolved, from that hour, to devote all his strength to expel the\r\n\"Spanish vermin\" from the Netherlands. One must not infer from this,\r\nhowever, that William, at this early period, meditated the design of\r\nshaking off the rule of Spain altogether. The object he had in view went\r\nno further than to relieve the country from the odious presence of the\r\nSpanish troops, and to place the administration in those hands to which\r\nit rightfully belonged. They, however, who set a revolution in motion\r\nhave not always the power to stop it. If they can succeed in giving it a\r\ndirection, they will probably be carried forward by it beyond their\r\nintended limits, until, gathering confidence with success, they aim at\r\nan end far higher than that which they had originally proposed. Such,\r\ndoubtless, was the case with William of Orange.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the emperor's recommendation, the prince of Orange was\r\nnot the man whom Philip selected for his confidence. Nor was it possible\r\nfor William to regard the king with the same feelings which he had\r\nentertained for the emperor. To Charles the prince was under obvious\r\nobligations for his nurture in early life. His national pride, too, was\r\nnot wounded by having a Spaniard for his sovereign, since Charles was\r\nnot by birth, much less in heart, a Spaniard. All this was reversed in\r\nPhilip, in whom William saw only the representative of a detested race.\r\nThe prudent reserve which marked the character of each, no doubt,\r\nprevented the outward demonstration of their sentiments; but from their\r\nactions we may readily infer the instinctive aversion which the two\r\nparties entertained for each other.\r\n\r\nAt the early age of eighteen, William married Anne of Egmont, daughter\r\nof the count of Büren. The connection was a happy one, if we may trust\r\nthe loving tone of their correspondence. Unhappily, in a few years their\r\nunion was dissolved by the lady's death. The prince did not long remain\r\na widower, before he made proposals to the daughter of the duchess of\r\nLorraine. The prospect of such a match gave great dissatisfaction to\r\nPhilip, who had no mind to see his Flemish vassal allied with the family\r\nof a great feudatory of France. Disappointed in this quarter, William\r\nnext paid his addresses to Anne of Saxony, an heiress, whose large\r\npossessions made her one of the most brilliant matches in Germany.\r\nWilliam's passion and his interest, it was remarked, kept time well\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe course of love, however, was not destined to run smoothly on the\r\npresent occasion. Anne was the daughter of Maurice, the great Lutheran\r\nchampion, the implacable enemy of Charles the Fifth. Left early an\r\norphan, she had been reared in the family of her uncle, the elector of\r\nSaxony, in the strictest tenets of the Lutheran faith. Such a connection\r\nwas, of course, every way distasteful to Philip, to whom William was\r\nwilling so far to defer as to solicit his approbation, though he did not\r\nmean to be controlled by it.[498] The correspondence on the subject, in\r\nwhich both the regent and Granvelle took an active part, occupies as\r\nmuch space in collections of the period as more important negotiations.\r\nThe prince endeavored to silence the king's scruples, by declaring that\r\nhe was too much a Catholic at heart to marry any woman who was not of\r\nthe same persuasion as himself; and that he had received assurances from\r\nthe elector that his wife in this respect should entirely conform to his\r\nwishes. The elector had scruples as to the match, no less than Philip,\r\nthough on precisely the opposite grounds; and, after the prince's\r\nassurance to the king, one is surprised to find that an understanding\r\nmust have existed with the elector that Anne should be allowed the\r\nundisturbed enjoyment of her own religion.[499] This double dealing\r\nleaves a disagreeable impression in regard to William's character. Yet\r\nit does not seem, to judge from his later life, to be altogether\r\ninconsistent with it. Machiavelli is the author whom he is said to have\r\nhad most frequently in his hand;[500] and in the policy with which he\r\nshaped his course, we may sometimes fancy that we can discern the\r\ninfluence of the Italian statesman.\r\n\r\nThe marriage was celebrated with great pomp at Leipsic, on the\r\ntwenty-fifth of August, 1561. The king of Denmark, several of the\r\nelectors, and many princes and nobles of both Germany and the Low\r\nCountries, were invited guests; and the whole assembly present on the\r\noccasion was estimated at nearly six thousand persons.[501] The king of\r\nSpain complimented the bride by sending her a jewel worth three thousand\r\nducats.[502] It proved, however, as Granvelle had predicted, an\r\nill-assorted union. After living together for nearly thirteen years, the\r\nprince, weary of the irregularities of his wife, separated from her, and\r\nsent her back to her friends in Germany.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WILLIAM OF ORANGE.]\r\n\r\nDuring his residence in Brussels, William easily fell into the way of\r\nlife followed by the Flemish nobles. He was very fond of the healthy\r\nexercise of the chase, and especially of hawking. He was social, indeed\r\nconvivial, in his habits, after the fashion of his countrymen;[503] and\r\nwas addicted to gallantries, which continued long enough, it is said, to\r\nsuggest an apology for the disorderly conduct of his wife. He occupied\r\nthe ancient palace of his family at Brussels, where he was surrounded by\r\nlords and cavaliers, and a numerous retinue of menials.[504] He lived in\r\ngreat state, displaying a profuse magnificence in his entertainments;\r\nand few there were, natives or foreigners, who had any claim on his\r\nhospitality, that did not receive it.[505] By this expensive way of\r\nlife, he encumbered his estate with a heavy debt; amounting, if we may\r\ntake Granvelle's word, to nine hundred thousand florins.[506] Yet, if\r\nWilliam's own account, but one year later, be true, the debt was then\r\nbrought within a very moderate compass.[507]\r\n\r\nWith his genial habits and love of pleasure, and with manners the most\r\nattractive, he had not the free and open temper which often goes along\r\nwith them. He was called by his contemporaries \"William the Silent.\"\r\nPerhaps the epithet was intended to indicate not so much his\r\ntaciturnity, as that impenetrable reserve which locked up his secrets\r\nclosely within his bosom. No man knew better how to keep his counsel,\r\neven from those who acted with him. But while masking his own designs,\r\nno man was more sagacious in penetrating those of others. He carried on\r\nan extensive correspondence in foreign countries, and employed every\r\nmeans for getting information. Thus, while he had it in his power to\r\noutwit others, it was very rare that he became their dupe. Though on\r\nordinary occasions frugal of words, when he did speak it was with\r\neffect. His eloquence was of the most persuasive kind;[508] and as\r\ntowards his inferiors he was affable, and exceedingly considerate of\r\ntheir feelings, he acquired an unbounded ascendancy over his\r\ncountrymen.[509] It must be admitted that the prince of Orange possessed\r\nmany rare qualities for the leader of a great revolution.\r\n\r\nThe course William took in respect to his wife's religion might lead one\r\nto doubt whether he were at heart Catholic or Protestant; or indeed\r\nwhether he were not equally indifferent to both persuasions. The latter\r\nopinion might be strengthened by a remark imputed to him, that \"he would\r\nnot have his wife trouble herself with such melancholy books as the\r\nScriptures, but instead of them amuse herself with Amadis de Gaul, and\r\nother pleasant works of the kind.\"[510] \"The prince of Orange,\" says a\r\nwriter of the time, \"passed for a Catholic among Catholics, a Lutheran\r\namong Lutherans. If he could, he would have had a religion compounded of\r\nboth. In truth, he looked on the Christian religion like the ceremonies\r\nwhich Numa introduced, as a sort of politic invention.\"[511] Granvelle,\r\nin a letter to Philip, speaks much to the same purpose.[512] These\r\nportraits were by unfriendly hands. Those who take a different view of\r\nhis character, while they admit that in his early days his opinions in\r\nmatters of faith were unsettled, contend that in time he became\r\nsincerely attached to the doctrines which he defended with his sword.\r\nThis seems to be no more than natural. But the reader will have an\r\nopportunity of judging for himself, when he has followed the great chief\r\nthrough the changes of his stormy career.\r\n\r\nIt would be strange, indeed, if the leader in a religious revolution\r\nshould have been himself without any religious convictions. One thing is\r\ncertain, he possessed a spirit of toleration, the more honorable that in\r\nthat day it was so rare. He condemned the Calvinists as restless and\r\nseditious; the Catholics, for their bigoted attachment to a dogma.\r\nPersecution in matters of faith he totally condemned, for freedom of\r\njudgment in such matters he regarded as the inalienable right of\r\nman.[513] These conclusions, at which the world, after an incalculable\r\namount of human suffering, has been three centuries in arriving, (has it\r\naltogether arrived at them yet?) must be allowed to reflect great credit\r\non the character of William.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GROUNDS OF COMPLAINT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nOPPOSITION TO THE GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nGrounds of Complaint.--The Spanish Troops.--The New\r\nBishoprics.--Influence on Granvelle.--Opposed by the Nobles.--His\r\nUnpopularity.\r\n\r\n1559-1562.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first cause of trouble, after Philip's departure from the\r\nNetherlands, arose from the detention of the Spanish troops there. The\r\nking had pledged his word, it will be remembered, that they should leave\r\nthe country by the end of four months, at farthest. Yet that period had\r\nlong since passed, and no preparations were made for their departure.\r\nThe indignation of the people rose higher and higher at the insult thus\r\noffered by the presence of these detested foreigners. It was a season of\r\npeace. No invasion was threatened from abroad; no insurrection existed\r\nat home. There was nothing to require the maintenance of an\r\nextraordinary force, much less of one composed of foreign troops. It\r\ncould only be that the king, distrusting his Flemish subjects, designed\r\nto overawe them by his mercenaries, in sufficient strength to enforce\r\nhis arbitrary acts. The free spirit of the Netherlanders was roused by\r\nthese suggestions, and they boldly demanded the removal of the\r\nSpaniards.\r\n\r\nGranvelle himself, who would willingly have pleased his master by\r\nretaining a force in the country on which he could rely, admitted that\r\nthe project was impracticable. \"The troops must be withdrawn,\" he wrote,\r\n\"and that speedily, or the consequence will be an insurrection.\"[514]\r\nThe states would not consent, he said, to furnish the necessary\r\nsubsidies while they remained. The prince of Orange and Count Egmont\r\nthrew up the commands intrusted to them by the king. They dared no\r\nlonger hold them, as the minister added, it was so unpopular.[515]\r\n\r\nThe troops had much increased the difficulty by their own misconduct.\r\nThey were drawn from the great mass, often the dregs, of the people; and\r\ntheir morals, such as they were, had not been improved in the life of\r\nthe camp. However strict their discipline in time of active service, it\r\nwas greatly relaxed in their present state of inaction; and they had\r\nfull license, as well as leisure, to indulge their mischievous\r\nappetites, at the expense of the unfortunate districts in which they\r\nwere quartered.\r\n\r\nYet Philip was slow in returning an answer to the importunate letters of\r\nthe regent and the minister; and when he did reply, it was to evade\r\ntheir request, lamenting his want of funds, and declaring his purpose to\r\nremove the forces so soon as he could pay their arrears. The public\r\nexchequer was undoubtedly at a low ebb; lower in Spain than in the\r\nNetherlands.[516] But no one could believe the royal credit so far\r\nreduced as not to be able to provide for the arrears of three or four\r\nthousand soldiers. The regent, however, saw that, with or without\r\ninstructions, it was necessary to act. Several of the members of the\r\ncouncil became sureties for the payment of the arrears, and the troops\r\nwere ordered to Zealand, in order to embark for Spain. But the winds\r\nproved unfavorable. Two months longer they were detained, on shore or on\r\nboard the transports. They soon got into brawls with the workmen\r\nemployed on the dikes; and the inhabitants, still apprehensive of orders\r\nfrom the king countermanding the departure of the Spaniards, resolved,\r\nin such an event, to abandon the dikes, and lay the country under\r\nwater![517] Fortunately, they were not driven to this extremity. In\r\nJanuary, 1561, more than a year after the date assigned by Philip, the\r\nnation was relieved of the presence of the intruders.[518]\r\n\r\nPhilip's conduct in this affair is not very easy to explain. However\r\nmuch he might have desired originally to maintain the troops in the\r\nNetherlands, as an armed police on which he could rely to enforce the\r\nexecution of his orders, it had become clear that the good they might do\r\nin quelling an insurrection was more than counterbalanced by the\r\nprobability of their exciting one. It was characteristic of the king,\r\nhowever, to be slow in retreating from any position he had taken; and,\r\nas we shall often have occasion to see, there was a certain apathy or\r\nsluggishness in his nature, which led him sometimes to leave events to\r\ntake their own course, rather than to shape a course for them himself.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty was no sooner settled, than it was followed by another\r\nscarcely less serious. We have seen, in a former chapter, the\r\narrangements made for adding thirteen new bishoprics to the four already\r\nexisting in the Netherlands. The measure, in itself a good one, and\r\ndemanded by the situation of the country, was, from the posture of\r\naffairs at that time, likely to meet with opposition, if not to occasion\r\ngreat excitement. For this reason, the whole affair had been kept\r\nprofoundly secret by the government. It was not till 1561 that Philip\r\ndisclosed his views, in a letter to some of the principal nobles in the\r\ncouncil of state. But, long before that time, the project had taken\r\nwind, and created a general sensation through the country.\r\n\r\nThe people looked on it as an attempt to subject them to the same\r\necclesiastical system which existed in Spain. The bishops, by virtue of\r\ntheir office, were possessed of certain inquisitorial powers, and these\r\nwere still further enlarged by the provisions of the royal edicts.\r\nPhilip's attachment to the Inquisition was well understood, and there\r\nwas probably not a child in the country who had not heard of the _auto\r\nda fé_ which he had sanctioned by his presence on his return to his\r\ndominions. The present changes were regarded as part of a great scheme\r\nfor introducing the Spanish Inquisition into the Netherlands.[519]\r\nHowever erroneous these conclusions, there is little reason to doubt\r\nthey were encouraged by those who knew their fallacy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE NEW BISHOPRICS.]\r\n\r\nThe nobles had other reasons for opposing the measure. The bishops would\r\noccupy in the legislature the place formerly held by the abbots, who\r\nwere indebted for their election to the religious houses over which they\r\npresided. The new prelates, on the contrary, would receive their\r\nnomination from the crown; and the nobles saw with alarm their own\r\nindependence menaced by the accession of an order of men who would\r\nnaturally be subservient to the interests of the monarch. That the crown\r\nwas not insensible to these advantages is evident from a letter of the\r\nminister, in which he sneers at the abbots, as \"men fit only to rule\r\nover monasteries, ever willing to thwart the king, and as perverse as\r\nthe lowest of the people.\"[520]\r\n\r\nBut the greatest opposition arose from the manner in which the new\r\ndignitaries were to be maintained. This was to be done by suppressing\r\nthe offices of the abbots, and by appropriating the revenues of their\r\nhouses to the maintenance of the bishops. For this economical\r\narrangement Granvelle seems to have been chiefly responsible. Thus the\r\nincome--amounting to fifty thousand ducats--of the Abbey of Afflighen,\r\none of the wealthiest in Brabant, was to be bestowed on the\r\narchiepiscopal see of Mechlin, to be held by the minister himself.[521]\r\nIn virtue of that dignity, Granvelle would become primate of the\r\nNetherlands.\r\n\r\nLoud was the clamor excited by this arrangement among the members of the\r\nreligious fraternities, and all those who directly or indirectly had any\r\ninterest in them. It was a manifest perversion of the funds from the\r\nobjects for which they had been given to the institutions. It was\r\ninterfering with the economy of these institutions, protected by the\r\nnational charters; and the people of Brabant appealed to the \"_Joyeuse\r\nEntrée_.\" Jurists of the greatest eminence, in different parts of\r\nEurope, were consulted as to the legality of these proceedings. Thirty\r\nthousand florins were expended by Brabant alone in this matter, as well\r\nas in employing an agent at the court of Rome to exhibit the true state\r\nof the affair to his holiness, and to counteract the efforts of the\r\nSpanish government.[522]\r\n\r\nThe reader may remember, that, just before Philip's departure from the\r\nNetherlands, a bull arrived from Rome authorizing the erection of the\r\nnew bishoprics. This was but the initiatory step. Many other proceedings\r\nwere necessary before the consummation of the affair. Owing to\r\nimpediments thrown in the way by the provinces, and the habitual\r\ntardiness of the court of Rome, nearly three years elapsed before the\r\nfinal briefs were expedited by Pius the Fourth. New obstacles were\r\nraised by the jealous temper of the Flemings, who regarded the whole\r\nmatter as a conspiracy of the pope and the king against the liberties of\r\nthe nation. Utrecht, Gueldres, and three other places, refused to\r\nreceive their bishops; and they never obtained a footing there.\r\nAntwerp, which was to have been made an episcopal see, sent a commission\r\nto the king to represent the ruin this would bring on its trade, from\r\nthe connection supposed to exist between the episcopal establishment and\r\nthe Spanish Inquisition. For a year the king would not condescend to\r\ngive any heed to the remonstrance. He finally consented to defer the\r\ndecision of the question till his arrival in the country; and Antwerp\r\nwas saved from its bishop.[523]\r\n\r\nIn another place we find the bishop obtaining an admission through the\r\nmanagement of Granvelle, who profited by the temporary absence of the\r\nnobles. Nowhere were the new prelates received with enthusiasm, but, on\r\nthe contrary, wherever they were admitted, it was with a coldness and\r\nsilence that intimated too plainly the aversion of the inhabitants. Such\r\nwas the case with the archbishop of Mechlin himself, who made his entry\r\ninto the capital of his diocese with not a voice to cheer or to welcome\r\nhim.[524] In fact, everywhere the newly elected prelate seemed more like\r\nthe thief stealthily climbing into the fold, than the good shepherd who\r\nhad come to guard it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the odium of these measures fell on the head of the minister.\r\nNo other man had been so active in enforcing them, and he had the credit\r\nuniversally with the people of having originated the whole scheme, and\r\nproposed it to the sovereign. But from this Philip expressly exonerates\r\nhim in a letter to the regent, in which he says, that the whole plan had\r\nbeen settled long before it was communicated to Granvelle.[525] Indeed,\r\nthe latter, with some show of reason, demanded whether, being already\r\none of four bishops in the country, he should be likely to recommend a\r\nplan which would make him only one of seventeen.[526] This appeal to\r\nself-interest did not wholly satisfy those who thought that it was\r\nbetter to be the first of seventeen, than to be merely one of four where\r\nall were equal.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been Granvelle's original way of thinking in the\r\nmatter, it is certain that, whether it arose from his accommodating\r\ntemper, or from his perceptions of the advantages of the scheme being\r\nquickened by his prospect of the primacy, he soon devoted himself, heart\r\nas well as hand, to carry out the royal views. \"I am convinced,\" he\r\nwrites, in the spring of 1560, to Philip's secretary, Perez, \"that no\r\nmeasure could be more advantageous to the country, or more necessary for\r\nthe support of religion; and if necessary to the success of the scheme,\r\nI would willingly devote to it my fortune and my life.\"[527]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INFLUENCE OF GRANVELLE.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly we find him using all his strength to carry the project\r\nthrough, devising expedients for raising the episcopal revenues, and\r\nthus occupying a position which exposed him to general obloquy. He felt\r\nthis bitterly, and at times, even with all his constancy, was hardly\r\nable to endure it. \"Though I say nothing,\" he writes in the month of\r\nSeptember, 1561, to the Spanish ambassador in Rome, \"I feel the danger\r\nof the situation in which the king has placed me. All the odium of these\r\nmeasures falls on my head; and I only pray that a remedy for the evil\r\nmay be found, though it should be by the sacrifice of myself. Would to\r\nGod the erection of these bishoprics had never been thought of!\"[528]\r\n\r\nIn February, 1561, Granvelle received a cardinal's hat from Pope Pius\r\nthe Fourth. He did not show the alacrity usually manifested in accepting\r\nthis distinguished honor. He had obtained it by the private intercession\r\nof the duchess of Parma; and he feared lest the jealousy of Philip might\r\nbe alarmed, were it to any other than himself that his minister owed\r\nthis distinction. But the king gave the proceeding his cordial sanction,\r\ndeclaring to Granvelle that the reward was no higher than his desert.\r\n\r\nThus clothed with the Roman purple, primate of the Netherlands, and\r\nfirst minister of state, Granvelle might now look down on the proudest\r\nnoble in the land. He stood at the head of both the civil and the\r\necclesiastical administration of the country. All authority centred in\r\nhis person. Indeed, such had been the organization of the council of\r\nstate, that the minister might be said to be not so much the head of the\r\ngovernment as the government itself.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the council were conducted in the manner prescribed by\r\nPhilip. Ordinary business passed through the hands of the whole body;\r\nbut affairs of moment were reserved for the cardinal and his two\r\ncoadjutors to settle with the regent. On such occasions the other\r\nministers were not even summoned, or, if summoned, such only of the\r\ndespatches from Spain as the minister chose to communicate were read,\r\nand the remainder reserved for the _consulta_. When, as did sometimes\r\nhappen, the nobles carried a measure in opposition to Granvelle, he\r\nwould refer the whole question to the court at Madrid.[529] By this\r\nexpedient he gained time for the present, and probably obtained a\r\ndecision in his favor at last. The regent conformed entirely to the\r\ncardinal's views. The best possible understanding seems to have\r\nsubsisted between them, to judge from the tone of their correspondence\r\nwith Philip, in which each of the parties bestows the most unqualified\r\npanegyric on the other. Yet there was a strange reserve in their\r\nofficial intercourse. Even when occupying the same palace, they are said\r\nto have communicated with each other by writing.[530] The reason\r\nsuggested for this singular proceeding is, that it might not appear,\r\nfrom their being much together, that the regent was acting so entirely\r\nunder the direction of the minister. It is certain that both Margaret\r\nand Granvelle had an uncommon passion for letter-writing, as is shown by\r\nthe length and number of their epistles, particularly to the king. The\r\ncardinal especially went into a gossiping minuteness of detail, to which\r\nfew men in his station would have condescended. But his master, to whom\r\nhis letters at this period were chiefly addressed, had the virtue of\r\npatience in an extraordinary degree, as is evinced by the faithful\r\nmanner in which he perused these despatches, and made notes upon them\r\nwith his own hand.\r\n\r\nThe minister occupied a palace in Brussels, and had another residence at\r\na short distance from the capital.[531] He maintained great pomp in his\r\nestablishment, was attended by a large body of retainers, and his\r\nequipage and liveries were distinguished by their magnificence. He gave\r\nnumerous banquets, held large _levées_, and, in short, assumed a state\r\nin his manner of living which corresponded with his station, and did no\r\nviolence to his natural taste. We may well believe that the great lords\r\nof the country, whose ancestors had for centuries filled its highest\r\nplaces, must have chafed as they saw themselves thrown into the shade by\r\none whose fortunes had been thus suddenly forced to this unnatural\r\nheight by the sunshine of royal favor. Their indignation was heightened\r\nby the tricky arrangement, which, while it left them ciphers in the\r\nadministration, made them responsible to the people for its measures.\r\nAnd if the imputation to Granvelle of arrogance, in the pride of his\r\nfull-blown fortunes, was warranted, feelings of a personal nature may\r\nhave mingled with those of general discontent.\r\n\r\nBut, however they may have felt, the Flemish lords must be allowed not\r\nto have been precipitate in the demonstration of their feelings. It is\r\nnot till 1562 that we observe the cardinal, in his correspondence with\r\nSpain, noticing any discourtesy in the nobles, or intimating the\r\nexistence of any misunderstanding with them. In the spring of the\r\npreceding year we find the prince of Orange \"commending himself\r\ncordially and affectionately to the cardinal's good will;\" and\r\nsubscribing himself, \"your very good friend to command.\"[532] In four\r\nmonths after this, on the twenty-third of July, we have a letter from\r\nthis \"very good friend\" and count Egmont, addressed to Philip. In this\r\nepistle the writers complain bitterly of their exclusion from all\r\nbusiness of importance in the council of state. They were only invited\r\nto take part in deliberations of no moment. This was contrary to the\r\nassurance of his majesty when they reluctantly accepted office; and it\r\nwas in obedience to his commands to advise him if this should occur that\r\nthey now wrote to him.[533] Nevertheless, they should have still\r\ncontinued to bear the indignity in silence, had they not found that they\r\nwere held responsible by the people for measures in which they had no\r\nshare.[534]--Considering the arrangement Philip had made for the\r\n_consulta_, one has little reason to commend his candor in this\r\ntransaction, and not much to praise his policy. As he did not redress\r\nthe evil, his implied disavowal of being privy to it would hardly go for\r\nanything with the injured party. In his answer, Philip thanked the\r\nnobles for their zeal in his service, and promised to reply to them more\r\nat large on the return of Count Hoorne to Flanders.[535]\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to suppose that Granvelle was ever acquainted with\r\nthe fact of the letter having been written by the two lords. The\r\nprivilege claimed by the novelist, who looks over the shoulders of his\r\nheroes and heroines when they are inditing their epistles, is also\r\nenjoyed by the historian. With the materials rescued from the mouldering\r\narchives of the past, he can present the reader with a more perfect view\r\nof the motives and opinions of the great actors in the drama three\r\ncenturies ago, than they possessed in respect to one another. This is\r\nparticularly true of the period before us, when the correspondence of\r\nthe parties interested was ample in itself, and, through the care taken\r\nof it, in public and private collections, has been well preserved. Such\r\ncare was seldom bestowed on historical documents of this class before\r\nthe sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OPPOSED BY THE NOBLES.]\r\n\r\nIt is not till long--nearly a year--after the date of the preceding\r\nletter, that anything appears to intimate the existence of a coldness,\r\nmuch less of an open rupture, between Granvelle and the discontented\r\nnobles. Meanwhile, the religious troubles in France had been fast\r\ngathering to a head; and the opposite factions ranged themselves under\r\nthe banners of their respective chiefs, prepared to decide the question\r\nby arms. Philip the Second, who stood forth as the champion of\r\nCatholicism, not merely in his own dominions, but throughout\r\nChristendom, watched with anxiety the struggle going forward in the\r\nneighboring kingdom. It had the deeper interest for him, from its\r\ninfluence on the Low Countries. His Italian possessions were separated\r\nfrom France by the Alps; his Spanish, by the Pyrenees. But no such\r\nmountain barrier lay between France and Flanders. They were not even\r\nseparated, in the border provinces, by difference of language. Every\r\nshock given to France must necessarily be felt in the remotest corner of\r\nthe Netherlands. Granvelle was so well aware of this, that he besought\r\nthe king to keep an eye on his French neighbors, and support them in the\r\nmaintenance of the Roman Catholic religion. \"That they should be\r\nmaintained in this is quite as important to us as it is to them. Many\r\nhere,\" he adds, \"would be right glad to see affairs go badly for the\r\nCatholics in that kingdom. No noble as yet among us has openly declared\r\nhimself. Should any one do so, God only could save the country from the\r\nfate of France.\"[536]\r\n\r\nActing on these hints, and conformably to his own views, Philip sent\r\norders to the regent to raise two thousand men, and send them across the\r\nborders to support the French Catholics. The orders met with decided\r\nresistance in the council of state. The great Flemish lords, at this\r\ntime, must have affected, if they did not feel, devotion to the\r\nestablished religion. But they well knew there was too large a leaven of\r\nheresy in the country to make these orders palatable. They felt no\r\ndesire, moreover, thus unnecessarily to mix themselves up with the feuds\r\nof France. They represented that the troops could not safely be\r\ndispensed with in the present state of feeling at home; and that, if\r\nthey marched against the Protestants of France, the German Protestants\r\nmight be expected to march against them.\r\n\r\nGranvelle, on the other hand, would have enforced the orders of Philip,\r\nas essential to the security of the Netherlands themselves. Margaret,\r\nthus pressed by the opposite parties, felt the embarrassment of either\r\ncourse. The alternative presented was, that of disobeying the king, or\r\nof incurring the resentment, perhaps the resistance, of the nation.\r\nOrange and Egmont besought her to convoke the states-general, as the\r\nonly safe counsellors in such an emergency. The states had often been\r\nconvened on matters of less moment by the former regent, Mary of\r\nHungary. But the cardinal had no mind to invoke the interference of that\r\n\"mischievous animal, the people.\"[537] He had witnessed a convocation of\r\nthe states previous to the embarkation of Philip; and he had not\r\nforgotten the independent tone then assumed by that body. It had been,\r\nindeed, the last injunction of the king to his sister, on no account to\r\ncall a meeting of the national legislature till his return to the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nBut while on this ground Margaret refused to summon the states-general,\r\nshe called a meeting of the order of the Golden Fleece, to whom she was\r\nto apply for counsel on extraordinary occasions. The knights of the\r\norder consisted of persons of the highest consideration in the country,\r\nincluding the governors of the provinces. In May, 1562, they assembled\r\nat Brussels. Before meeting in public, the prince of Orange invited them\r\nto a conference in his own palace. He there laid before them the state\r\nof the country, and endeavored to concert with the members some regular\r\nsystem of resistance to the exclusive and arbitrary course of the\r\nminister. Although no definite action took place at that time, most of\r\nthose present would seem to have fallen in with the views of the prince.\r\nThere were some, however, who took opposite ground, and who declared\r\nthemselves content with Granvelle, and not disposed to prescribe to\r\ntheir sovereign the choice of his ministers. The foremost of these were\r\nthe duke of Arschot, a zealous Catholic, and Count Barlaimont, president\r\nof the council of finance, and, as we have already seen, altogether\r\ndevoted to the minister. This nobleman communicated to Margaret the\r\nparticulars of the meeting in the prince's palace; and the regent was\r\ncareful to give the knights of the order such incessant occupation\r\nduring the remainder of their stay in the capital, as to afford the\r\nprince of Orange no opportunity of pursuing his scheme of\r\nagitation.[538]\r\n\r\nBefore the assembly of the Golden Fleece had been dissolved, it was\r\ndecided to send an envoy to the king to lay before him the state of the\r\ncountry, both in regard to the religious excitement, much stimulated in\r\ncertain quarters by the condition of France, and to the financial\r\nembarrassments, which now pressed heavily on the government. The person\r\nselected for the office was Florence de Montmorency, lord of Montigny, a\r\ncavalier who had the boldness to avow his aversion to any interference\r\nwith the rights of conscience, and whose sympathies, it will be\r\nbelieved, were not on the side of the minister.\r\n\r\nSoon after his departure, the vexed question of aid to France was\r\nsettled in the council by commuting personal service for money. It was\r\ndecided to raise a subsidy of fifty thousand crowns, to be remitted at\r\nonce to the French government.[539]\r\n\r\nMontigny reached Spain in June, 1562. He was graciously received by\r\nPhilip, who, in a protracted audience, gathered from him a\r\ncircumstantial account of the condition of the Netherlands. In answer to\r\nthe royal queries, the envoy also exposed the misunderstanding which\r\nexisted between the minister and the nobles.\r\n\r\nBut the duchess of Parma did not trust this delicate affair to the\r\nrepresentations of Montigny. She wrote herself to her brother, in\r\nItalian, which, when she would give her own views on matters of\r\nimportance, she used instead of French, ordinarily employed by the\r\nsecretaries. In Italian she expressed herself with the greatest fluency,\r\nand her letters in that language, for the purpose of secrecy, were\r\nwritten with her own hand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OPPOSED BY THE NOBLES.]\r\n\r\nThe duchess informed the king of the troubles that had arisen with the\r\nnobles; charging Orange and Egmont, especially, as the source of them.\r\nShe accused them of maliciously circulating rumors that the cardinal had\r\nadvised Philip to invade the country with an armed force, and to cut off\r\nthe heads of some five or six of the principal malecontents.[540] She\r\npaid a high tribute to the minister's loyalty, and his talent for\r\nbusiness; and she besought the king to disabuse Montigny in respect to\r\nthe common idea of a design to introduce the Spanish Inquisition into\r\nthe country, and to do violence to its institutions.\r\n\r\nThe war was now openly proclaimed between the cardinal and the nobles.\r\nWhatever decorum might be preserved in their intercourse, there was no\r\nlonger any doubt as to the hostile attitude in which they were hereafter\r\nto stand in respect to each other. In a letter written a short time\r\nprevious to that of the regent, the cardinal gives a brief view of his\r\nsituation to the king. The letter is written in the courageous spirit of\r\none who does not shrink from the dangers that menace him. After an\r\nobservation intimating no great confidence in the orthodoxy of the\r\nprince of Orange, he remarks: \"Though the prince shows me a friendly\r\nface, when absent he is full of discontent. They have formed a league\r\nagainst me,\" he continues, \"and threaten my life. But I have little fear\r\non that score, as I think they are much too wise to attempt any such\r\nthing. They complain of my excluding them from office, and endeavoring\r\nto secure an absolute authority for your majesty. All which they repeat\r\nopenly at their banquets, with no good effect on the people. Yet never\r\nwere there governors of the provinces who possessed so much power as\r\nthey have, or who had all appointments more completely in their own\r\nhands. In truth, their great object is to reduce your majesty and the\r\nregent to the condition of mere ciphers in the government.\"\r\n\r\n\"They refuse to come to my table,\" he adds, \"at which I smile. I find\r\nguests enough in the gentry of the country, the magistrates, and even\r\nthe worthy burghers of the city, whose good-will it is well to\r\nconciliate against a day of trouble. These evils I bear with patience,\r\nas I can. For adversity is sent by the Almighty, who will recompense\r\nthose who suffer for religion and justice.\" The cardinal was fond of\r\nregarding himself in the light of a martyr.\r\n\r\nHe concludes this curious epistle with beseeching the king to come soon\r\nto the Netherlands; \"to come well attended, and with plenty of money;\r\nsince, thus provided, he will have no lack of troops, if required to act\r\nabroad, while his presence will serve to calm the troubled spirits at\r\nhome.\"[541] The politic minister says nothing of the use that might be\r\nmade of these troops at home. Such an intimation would justify the\r\ncharges already brought against him. He might safely leave his master to\r\nmake that application for himself.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1562, Montigny returned from his mission, and straightway\r\nmade his report to the council of state. He enlarged on the solicitude\r\nwhich Philip had shown for the interests of the country. Nothing had\r\nbeen further from his mind than to introduce into it the Spanish\r\nInquisition. He was only anxious to exterminate the growing heresy from\r\nthe land, and called on those in authority to aid in the good work with\r\nall their strength. Finally, though pressed by want of funds, he\r\npromised, so soon as he could settle his affairs in Spain, to return to\r\nFlanders.--It was not unusual for Philip to hold out the idea of his\r\nspeedy return to the country. The king's gracious reception seems to\r\nhave had some effect on Montigny. At all events, he placed a degree of\r\nconfidence in the royal professions, in which the sceptical temper of\r\nWilliam was far from acquiescing. He intimated as much to his friend,\r\nand the latter, not relishing the part of a dupe, which the prince's\r\nlanguage seemed to assign to him, retorted in an angry manner; and\r\nsomething like altercation took place between the two lords, in the\r\npresence of the duchess. At least, such is the report of the\r\nhistorians.[542] But historians in a season of faction are not the best\r\nauthorities. In the troubles before us we have usually a safer guide in\r\nthe correspondence of the actors.\r\n\r\nBy Montigny despatches were also brought from Philip for the duchess of\r\nParma. They contained suggestions as to her policy in reference to the\r\nfactious nobles, whom the king recommended to her, if possible, to\r\ndivide by sowing the seeds of jealousy among them.[543] Egmont was a\r\nstanch Catholic, loyal in his disposition, ambitious, and vain. It would\r\nnot be difficult to detach him from his associates by a show of\r\npreference, which, while it flattered his vanity, would excite in them\r\njealousy and distrust.\r\n\r\nIn former times there had been something of these feelings betwixt\r\nEgmont and the prince of Orange. At least there had been estrangement.\r\nThis might, in some degree, be referred to the contrast in their\r\ncharacters. Certainly no two characters could be more strongly\r\ncontrasted with each other. Egmont, frank, fiery, impulsive in his\r\ntemper, had little in common with the cool, cautious, and calculating\r\nWilliam. The showy qualities of the former, lying on the surface, more\r\nreadily caught the popular eye. There was a depth in William's character\r\nnot easy to be fathomed,--an habitual reserve, which made it difficult\r\neven for those who knew him best always to read him right. Yet the\r\ncoolness between these two nobles may have arisen less from difference\r\nof character than from similarity of position. Both, by their rank and\r\nservices, took the foremost ground in public estimation, so that it was\r\nscarcely possible they should not jostle each other in the career of\r\nambition. But however divided formerly, they were now too closely united\r\nby the pressure of external circumstances to be separated by the subtle\r\npolicy of Philip. Under the influence of a common disgust with the\r\nadministration and its arbitrary measures, they continued to act in\r\nconcert together, and, in their union, derived benefit from the very\r\nopposition of their characters. For what better augury of success than\r\nthat afforded by the union of wisdom in council with boldness in\r\nexecution?\r\n\r\nThe consequences of the troubles in France, as had been foreseen, were\r\nsoon visible in the Low Countries. The Protestants of that time\r\nconstituted a sort of federative republic, or rather a great secret\r\nassociation, extending through the different parts of Europe, but so\r\nclosely linked together that a blow struck in one quarter instantly\r\nvibrated to every other. The Calvinists in the border provinces of the\r\nLow Countries felt, in particular, great sympathy with the movements of\r\ntheir French brethren. Many Huguenots took shelter among them. Others\r\ncame to propagate their doctrines. Tracts in the French tongue were\r\ndistributed and read with avidity. Preachers harangued in the\r\nconventicles; and the people, by hundreds and thousands, openly\r\nassembled, and, marching in procession, chanted the Psalms of David in\r\nthe translation of Marot.[544]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RESISTANCE TO THE EDICTS.]\r\n\r\nThis open defiance of the edicts called for the immediate interposition\r\nof the government. At Tournay two Calvinist preachers were arrested,\r\nand, after a regular trial, condemned and burned at the stake. In\r\nValenciennes two others were seized, in like manner, tried, and\r\nsentenced to the same terrible punishment. But as the marquis of Bergen,\r\nthe governor of the province, had left the place on a visit to a\r\ndistant quarter, the execution was postponed till his return. Seven\r\nmonths thus passed, when the regent wrote to the marquis, remonstrating\r\non his unseasonable absence from his post. He had the spirit to answer,\r\nthat \"it neither suited his station nor his character to play the part\r\nof an executioner.\"[545] The marquis of Bergen had early ranged himself\r\non the side of the prince of Orange, and he is repeatedly noticed by\r\nGranvelle, in his letters, as the most active of the malecontents. It\r\nmay well be believed he was no friend to the system of persecution\r\npursued by the government. Urged by Granvelle, the magistrates of the\r\ncity at length assumed the office of conducting the execution\r\nthemselves. On the day appointed, the two martyrs were escorted to the\r\nstake. The funeral pile was prepared, and the torch was about to be\r\napplied, when, at a signal from one of the prisoners, the multitude\r\naround broke in upon the place of execution, trampled down the guards\r\nand officers of justice, scattered the fagots collected for the\r\nsacrifice, and liberated the victims. Then, throwing themselves into a\r\nprocession, they paraded the streets of the city, singing their psalms\r\nand Calvinistic hymns.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the officers of justice succeeded in again arresting the\r\nunfortunate men, and carrying them back to prison. But it was not long\r\nbefore their friends, assembling in greater numbers than before, stormed\r\nthe fortress, forced the gates, and, rescuing the prisoners, carried\r\nthem off in triumph.\r\n\r\nThese high-handed measures caused, as may be supposed, great indignation\r\nat the court of the regent. She instantly ordered a levy of three\r\nthousand troops, and, placing them under the marquis of Bergen, sent\r\nthem against the insurgents. The force was such as to overcome all\r\nresistance. Arrests were made in great numbers, and the majesty of the\r\nlaw was vindicated by the trial and punishment of the ringleaders.[546]\r\n\r\n\"Rigorous and severe measures,\" wrote Philip, \"are the only ones to be\r\nemployed in matters of religion. It is by fear only that the\r\nrabble\"--meaning by this the Reformers--\"can be made to do their duty,\r\nand not always then.\"[547] This liberal sentiment found less favor in\r\nthe Low Countries than in Spain. \"One must ponder well,\" writes the\r\ncardinal to Perez, the royal secretary, \"before issuing those absolute\r\ndecrees, which are by no means as implicitly received here as they are\r\nin Italy.\"[548] The Fleming appealed to his laws, and, with all the\r\nminister's zeal, it was found impossible to move forward at the fiery\r\npace of the Spanish Inquisition.\r\n\r\n\"It would raise a tumult at once,\" he writes, \"should we venture to\r\narrest a man without the clearest evidence. No man can be proceeded\r\nagainst without legal proof.\"[549] But an insurmountable obstacle in the\r\nway of enforcing the cruel edicts lay in the feelings of the nation. No\r\nlaw repugnant to such feelings can long be executed. \"I accuse none of\r\nthe nobles of being heretics,\" writes the regent to her brother; \"but\r\nthey show little zeal in the cause of religion, while the magistrates\r\nshrink from their duty from fear of the people.\"[550] \"How absurd is\r\nit,\" exclaims Granvelle, \"for depositions to be taken before the\r\nInquisition in Spain, in order to search out heretics in Antwerp, where\r\nthousands are every day walking about whom no one meddles with!\"[551]\r\n\"It is more than a year,\" he says, \"since a single arrest on a charge of\r\nheresy has taken place in that city.\"[552] Yet whatever may have been\r\nthe state of persecution at the present time, the vague dread of the\r\nfuture must have taken strong hold of people's minds, if, as a\r\ncontemporary writes, there were no less than eighteen or twenty thousand\r\nrefugees then in England, who had fled from Flanders for the sake of\r\ntheir religion.[553]\r\n\r\nThe odium of this persecution all fell on the head of Granvelle. He was\r\nthe tool of Spain. Spain was under the yoke of the Inquisition.\r\nTherefore it was clearly the minister's design to establish the Spanish\r\nInquisition over the Netherlands. Such was the concise logic by which\r\npeople connected the name of Granvelle with that of the most dreaded of\r\ntribunals.[554] He was held responsible for the contrivance of the most\r\nunpopular measures of government, as well as for their execution. A\r\nthousand extravagant stories were circulated both of his private and his\r\npolitical life, which it is probably doing no injustice to the nobles to\r\nsuppose they did not take much pains to correct. The favorite of the\r\nprince is rarely the favorite of the people. But no minister had ever\r\nbeen so unpopular as Granvelle in the Netherlands. He was hated by the\r\nnobles for his sudden elevation to power, and for the servile means, as\r\nthey thought, by which he had risen to it. The people hated him, because\r\nhe used that power for the ruin of their liberties. No\r\nadministration--none certainly, if we except that of the iron Alva--was\r\nmore odious to the nation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LEAGUE AGAINST GRANVELLE.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Granvelle's constancy, and the countenance he received\r\nfrom the regent and a few of the leading councillors, it was hard to\r\nbear up under this load of obloquy. He would gladly have had the king\r\nreturn to the country, and sustain him by his presence. It is the burden\r\nof his correspondence at this period. \"It is a common notion here,\" he\r\nwrites to the secretary, Perez, \"that they are all ready in Spain to\r\nsacrifice the Low Countries. The lords talk so freely, that every moment\r\nI fear an insurrection.... For God's sake, persuade the king to come, or\r\nit will lie heavy on his conscience.\"[555] The minister complains to the\r\nsecretary that he seems to be entirely abandoned by the government at\r\nhome. \"It is three months,\" he writes, \"since I have received a letter\r\nfrom the court. We know as little of Spain here as of the Indies. Such\r\ndelays are dangerous, and may cost the king dear.\"[556]--It is clear his\r\nmajesty exercised his royal prerogative of having the correspondence all\r\non one side. At least his own share in it, at this period, was small,\r\nand his letters were concise indeed in comparison with the voluminous\r\nepistles of his minister. Perhaps there was some policy in this silence\r\nof the monarch. His opinions, nay, his wishes, would have, to some\r\nextent, the weight of laws. He would not, therefore, willingly commit\r\nhimself. He preferred to conform to his natural tendency to trust to the\r\ncourse of events, instead of disturbing them by too precipitate action.\r\nThe cognomen by which Philip is recognized on the roll of Castilian\r\nprinces is \"the Prudent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nGRANVELLE COMPELLED TO WITHDRAW.\r\n\r\nLeague against Granvelle.--Margaret desires his Removal.--Philip\r\ndeliberates.--Granvelle dismissed.--Leaves the Netherlands.\r\n\r\n1562-1564.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the state of feeling towards Granvelle, in the nation generally,\r\nwas such as is described in the preceding chapter, the lords who were in\r\nthe council of state chafed more and more under their exclusion from\r\nbusiness. As the mask was now thrown away, they no longer maintained the\r\nshow of deference which they had hitherto paid to the minister. From\r\nopposition to his measures, they passed to irony, ridicule, sarcasm;\r\ntill, finding that their assaults had little effect to disturb\r\nGranvelle's temper, and still less to change his policy, they grew at\r\nlength less and less frequent in their attendance at the council, where\r\nthey played so insignificant a part. This was a sore embarrassment to\r\nthe regent, who needed the countenance of the great nobles to protect\r\nher with the nation, in the unpopular measures in which she was\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nEven Granvelle, with all his equanimity, considered the crisis so grave\r\nas to demand some concession, or at least a show of it, on his own part,\r\nto conciliate the good-will of his enemies. He authorized the duchess to\r\nsay that he was perfectly willing that they should be summoned to the\r\n_consulta_, and to absent himself from its meetings; indeed, to resign\r\nthe administration altogether, provided the king approved of it.[557]\r\nWhether Margaret communicated this to the nobles does not appear; at all\r\nevents, as nothing came of these magnanimous concessions of the\r\nminister, they had no power to soothe the irritation of his\r\nenemies.[558]\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the disaffected lords were bending their efforts to\r\nconsolidate their league, of which Granvelle, it may be recollected,\r\nnoticed the existence in a letter of the preceding year. We now find the\r\nmembers binding themselves to each other by an oath of secrecy.[559] The\r\npersons who formed this confederacy were the governors of the\r\nprovinces, the knights of the Golden Fleece, and, in short, most of the\r\naristocracy of any consideration in the country. It seemed impossible\r\nthat any minister could stand against such a coalition, resting,\r\nmoreover, on the sympathies of the people. This formidable association,\r\nseeing that all attempts to work on the cardinal were ineffectual,\r\nresolved at length to apply directly to the king for his removal. They\r\nstated that, knowing the heavy cares which pressed on his majesty, they\r\nhad long dissembled and kept silence, rather than aggravate these cares\r\nby their complaints. If they now broke this silence, it was from a sense\r\nof duty to the king, and to save the country from ruin. They enlarged on\r\nthe lamentable condition of affairs, which, without specifying any\r\nparticular charges, they imputed altogether to the cardinal, or rather\r\nto the position in which he stood in reference to the nation. It was\r\nimpossible, they said, that the business of the country could prosper,\r\nwhere the minister who directed it was held in such general detestation\r\nby the people. They earnestly implored the king to take immediate\r\nmeasures for removing an evil which menaced the speedy ruin of the land.\r\nAnd they concluded with begging that they might be allowed to resign\r\ntheir seats in the council of state, where, in the existing state of\r\naffairs, their presence could be of no service.--This letter, dated the\r\neleventh of March, 1563, was signed, on behalf of the coalition, by\r\nthree lords who had places in the council of state,--the prince of\r\nOrange, Count Egmont, and Count Hoorne.[560]\r\n\r\nThe last nobleman was of an ancient and most honorable lineage. He held\r\nthe high office of admiral of the Netherlands, and had been governor\r\nboth of Zütphen and of Gueldres. He accompanied Philip to Spain, and\r\nduring his absence the province of Gueldres was transferred to another,\r\nCount Megen, for which Hoorne considered that he was indebted to the\r\ngood offices of the cardinal. On his return to his own country, he at\r\nonce enrolled himself in the ranks of the opposition. He was a man of\r\nindisputable bravery, of a quick and impatient temper; one, on the\r\nwhole, who seems to have been less indebted for his celebrity to his\r\ncharacter, than to the peculiar circumstances in which he was placed.\r\n\r\nOn the day previous to this despatch of the nobles, we find a letter to\r\nthe king from Granvelle, who does not seem to have been ignorant of what\r\nwas doing by the lords. He had expostulated with them, he tells Philip,\r\non the disloyalty of their conduct in thus banding against the\r\ngovernment,--a proceeding which in other times might have subjected them\r\nto a legal prosecution.[561] He mentions no one by name except Egmont,\r\nwhom he commends as more tractable and open to reason than his\r\nconfederates. He was led away by evil counsellors, and Granvelle\r\nexpresses the hope that he will one day open his eyes to his errors, and\r\nreturn to his allegiance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LEAGUE AGAINST GRANVELLE.]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to conceive the detestation, he goes on to say, in which\r\nthe Spaniards are held by the nation. The Spaniards only, it was\r\neverywhere said, were regarded by the court of Madrid as the lawful\r\nchildren; the Flemings, as illegitimate.[562] It was necessary to do\r\naway this impression to place the Flemings on the same footing with the\r\nSpaniards; to give them lucrative appointments, for they greatly needed\r\nthem, in Spain or in Italy; and it might not be amiss to bestow the\r\nviceroyalty of Sicily on the prince of Orange.--Thus, by the same act,\r\nthe politic minister would both reward his rivals and remove them from\r\nthe country. But he greatly misunderstood the character of William, if\r\nhe thought in this way to buy him off from the opposition.\r\n\r\nIt was four months before the confederates received an answer; during\r\nwhich time affairs continued to wear the same gloomy aspect as before.\r\nAt length came the long-expected epistle from the monarch, dated on the\r\nsixth of June. It was a brief one. Philip thanked the lords for their\r\nzeal and devotion to his service. After well considering the matter,\r\nhowever, he had not found any specific ground of complaint alleged, to\r\naccount for the advice given him to part with his minister. The king\r\nhoped before long to visit the Low Countries in person. Meanwhile, he\r\nshould be glad to see any one of the nobles in Spain, to learn from him\r\nthe whole state of the affair; as it was not his wont to condemn his\r\nministers without knowing the grounds on which they were accused.[563]\r\n\r\nThe fact that the lords had not specified any particular subject of\r\ncomplaint against the cardinal gave the king an obvious advantage in the\r\ncorrespondence. It seemed to be too much to expect his immediate\r\ndismissal of the minister, on the vague pretext of his unpopularity,\r\nwithout a single instance of misconduct being alleged against him. Yet\r\nthis was the position in which the enemies of Granvelle necessarily\r\nfound themselves. The minister acted by the orders of the king. To have\r\nassailed the minister's acts, therefore, would have been to attack the\r\nking himself. Egmont, some time after this, with even more frankness\r\nthan usual, is said to have declared at table to a friend of the\r\ncardinal, that \"the blow was aimed not so much at the minister as at the\r\nmonarch.\"[564]\r\n\r\nThe discontent of the lords at receiving this laconic epistle may be\r\nimagined. They were indignant that so little account should be made of\r\ntheir representations, and that both they and the country should be\r\nsacrificed to the king's partiality for his minister. The three lords\r\nwaited on the regent, and extorted from her a reluctant consent to\r\nassemble the knights of the order, and to confer with them and the other\r\nnobles as to the course to be taken.\r\n\r\nIt was there decided that the lords should address a second letter, in\r\nthe name of the whole body, to Philip, and henceforth should cease to\r\nattend the council of state.[565]\r\n\r\nIn this letter, which bears the date of July the twenty-ninth, they\r\nexpress their disappointment that his majesty had not come to a more\r\ndefinite resolution, when prompt and decisive measures could alone save\r\nthe country from ruin. They excuse themselves from visiting Spain in the\r\ncritical state of affairs at home. At another time, and for any other\r\npurpose, did the king desire it, they would willingly do so. But it was\r\nnot their design to appear as accusers, and institute a process against\r\nthe minister. They had hoped their own word in such an affair would have\r\nsufficed with his majesty. It was not the question whether the minister\r\nwas to be condemned, but whether he was to be removed from an office for\r\nwhich he was in no respect qualified.[566] They had hoped their\r\nattachment and tried fidelity to the crown would have made it\r\nsuperfluous for them to go into a specification of charges. These,\r\nindeed, could be easily made, but the discontent and disorder which now\r\nreigned throughout the country were sufficient evidence of the\r\nminister's incapacity.[567]\r\n\r\nThey stated that they had acquainted the regent with their intention to\r\nabsent themselves in future from the council, where their presence could\r\nbe no longer useful; and they trusted this would receive his majesty's\r\nsanction. They expressed their determination loyally and truly to\r\ndischarge every trust reposed in them by the government; and they\r\nconcluded by apologizing for the homely language of their epistle,--for\r\nthey were no haranguers or orators, but men accustomed to act rather\r\nthan to talk, as was suited to persons of their quality.[568]--This last\r\nshaft was doubtless aimed at the cardinal.--The letter was signed by the\r\nsame triumvirate as the former. The abstract here given does no justice\r\nto the document, which is of considerable length, and carefully written.\r\nThe language is that of men who to the habitual exercise of authority\r\nunited a feeling of self-respect, which challenged the respect of their\r\nopponents. Such were not the men to be cajoled or easily intimidated. It\r\nwas the first time that Philip had been addressed in this lofty tone by\r\nhis great vassals. It should have opened his eyes to the condition and\r\nthe character of his subjects in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThe coalition drew up, at the same time, an elaborate \"remonstrance,\"\r\nwhich they presented to Margaret. In it they set forth the various\r\ndisorders of the country, especially those growing out of the state of\r\nreligion and the embarrassment of the finances. The only remedy for\r\nthese evils is to be found in a meeting of the states-general. The\r\nking's prohibition of this measure must have proceeded, no doubt, from\r\nthe evil counsels of persons hostile to the true interests of the\r\nnation. As their services can be of little use while they are thus\r\ndebarred from a resort to their true and only remedy in their\r\nembarrassments, they trust the regent will not take it amiss, that, so\r\nlong as the present policy is pursued, they decline to take their seats\r\nin the council of state, to be merely shadows there, as they have been\r\nfor the last four years.[569]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARGARET DESIRES HIS REMOVAL.]\r\n\r\nFrom this period the malecontent lords no more appeared in council. The\r\nperplexity of Margaret was great. Thus abandoned by the nobles in whom\r\nthe country had the greatest confidence, she was left alone, as it were,\r\nwith the man whom the country held in the greatest abhorrence. She had\r\nlong seen with alarm the storm gathering round the devoted head of the\r\nminister. To attempt alone to uphold his falling fortunes would be\r\nprobably to bury herself in their ruins. In her extremity, she appealed\r\nto the confederates, and, since she could not divide them, endeavored to\r\ndivert them from their opposition. They, on the other hand, besought\r\nthe regent no longer to connect herself with the desperate cause of a\r\nminister so odious to the country. Possibly they infused into her mind\r\nsome suspicions of the subordinate part she was made to play, through\r\nthe overweening ambition of the cardinal. At all events, an obvious\r\nchange took place in her conduct, and while she deferred less and less\r\nto Granvelle, she entered into more friendly relations with his enemies.\r\nThis was especially the case with Egmont, whose frank and courteous\r\nhearing and loyal disposition seem to have won greatly on the esteem of\r\nthe duchess.\r\n\r\nSatisfied, at last, that it would be impracticable to maintain the\r\ngovernment much longer on its present basis, Margaret resolved to write\r\nto her brother on the subject, and at the same time to send her\r\nconfidential secretary, Armenteros, to Spain, to acquaint the king with\r\nthe precise state of affairs in the Netherlands.[570]\r\n\r\nAfter enlarging on the disorders and difficulties of the country, the\r\nduchess came to the quarrel between the cardinal and the nobles. She had\r\nmade every effort to reconcile the parties; but that was impossible. She\r\nwas fully sensible of the merits of Granvelle, his high capacity, his\r\nexperience in public affairs, his devotion to the interests both of the\r\nking and of religion.[571] But, on the other hand, to maintain him in\r\nthe Netherlands, in opposition to the will of the nobles, was to expose\r\nthe country, not merely to great embarrassments, but to the danger of\r\ninsurrection.[572] The obligations of the high place which she occupied\r\ncompelled her to lay the true state of the case before the king, and he\r\nwould determine the course to be pursued.--With this letter, bearing the\r\ndate of August twelfth, and fortified with ample instructions from the\r\nduchess, Armenteros was forthwith despatched on his mission to Spain.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the state of feeling in the cabinet of Brussels\r\nwas known, or at least surmised, throughout the country. It was the\r\ninterest of some of the parties that it should not be kept secret. The\r\ncardinal, thus abandoned by his friends, became a more conspicuous mark\r\nfor the shafts of his enemies. Libels, satires, pasquinades, were\r\nlaunched against him from every quarter. Such fugitive pieces, like the\r\ninsect which dies when it has left its sting, usually perish with the\r\noccasion that gives them birth. But some have survived to the present\r\nday, or at least were in existence at the close of the last century, and\r\nare much commended by a critic for the merits of their literary\r\nexecution.[573]\r\n\r\nIt was the custom, at the period of our narrative, for the young people\r\nto meet in the towns and villages, and celebrate what were called\r\n\"academic games,\" consisting of rhetorical discussions on the various\r\ntopics of the day, sometimes of a theological or a political character.\r\nPublic affairs furnished a fruitful theme at this crisis; and the\r\ncardinal, in particular, was often roughly handled. It was in vain the\r\ngovernment tried to curb this licence. It only served to stimulate the\r\ndisputants to new displays of raillery and ridicule.[574]\r\n\r\nGranvelle, it will be readily believed, was not slow to perceive his\r\nloss of credit with the regent, and the more intimate relations into\r\nwhich she had entered with his enemies. But whatever he may have felt,\r\nhe was too proud or too politic to betray his mortification to the\r\nduchess. Thus discredited by all but an insignificant party, who were\r\nbranded as the \"Cardinalists,\" losing influence daily with the regent,\r\nat open war with the nobles, and hated by the people, never was there a\r\nminister in so forlorn a situation, or one who was able to maintain his\r\npost a day in such circumstances. Yet Granvelle did not lose heart; as\r\nothers failed him, he relied the more on himself; and the courage which\r\nhe displayed, when thus left alone, as it were, to face the anger of the\r\nnation, might have well commanded the respect of his enemies. He made no\r\nmean concession to secure the support of the nobles, or to recover the\r\nfavor of the regent. He did not shrink from the dangers or the\r\nresponsibilities of his station; though the latter, at least, bore\r\nheavily on him. Speaking of the incessant pressure of his cares, he\r\nwrites to his correspondent, Perez, \"My hairs have turned so white you\r\nwould not recognize me.\"[575] He was then but forty-six. On one\r\noccasion, indeed, we do find him telling the king, that, \"if his majesty\r\ndoes not soon come to the Netherlands, he must withdraw from them.\"[576]\r\nThis seems to have been a sudden burst of feeling, as it was a solitary\r\none, forced from him by the extremity of his situation. It was much more\r\nin character that he wrote afterwards to the secretary, Perez: \"I am so\r\nbeset with dangers on every side, that most people give me up for lost.\r\nBut I mean to live as long, by the grace of God, as I can; and if they\r\ndo take away my life, I trust they will not gain everything for all\r\nthat.\"[577] He nowhere intimates a wish to be recalled. Nor would his\r\nambition allow him to resign the helm; but the fiercer the tempest\r\nraged, the more closely did he cling to the wreck of his fortunes.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Armenteros with the despatches, and the tidings that he\r\nbrought, caused a great sensation in the court of Madrid. \"We are on the\r\neve of a terrible conflagration,\" writes one of the secretaries of\r\nPhilip; \"and they greatly err who think it will pass away as formerly.\"\r\nHe expresses the wish that Granvelle would retire from the country,\r\nwhere, he predicts, they would soon wish his return. \"But ambition,\" he\r\nadds, \"and the point of honor are alike opposed to this. Nor does the\r\nking desire it.\"[578]\r\n\r\nYet it was not easy to say what the king did desire,--certainly not what\r\ncourse he would pursue. He felt a natural reluctance to abandon the\r\nminister, whose greatest error seemed to be that of too implicit an\r\nobedience to his master's commands. He declared he would rather risk the\r\nloss of the Netherlands than abandon him.[579] Yet how was that minister\r\nto be maintained in his place, in opposition to the will of the nation?\r\nIn this perplexity, Philip applied for counsel to the man in whom he\r\nmost confided,--the duke of Alva; the very worst counsellor possible in\r\nthe present emergency.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PHILIP'S LETTER TO GRANVELLE.]\r\n\r\nThe duke's answer was eminently characteristic of the man. \"When I read\r\nthe letters of these lords,\" he says, \"I am so filled with rage, that,\r\ndid I not make an effort to suppress it, my language would appear to you\r\nthat of a madman.\"[580] After this temperate exordium, he recommends the\r\nking on no account to remove Granvelle from the administration of the\r\nNetherlands. \"It is a thing of course,\" he says, \"that the cardinal\r\nshould be the first victim. A rebellion against the prince naturally\r\nbegins with an attack on his ministers. It would be better,\" he\r\ncontinues, \"if all could be brought at once to summary justice. Since\r\nthat cannot be, it may be best to divide the nobles; to win over Egmont\r\nand those who follow him by favors; to show displeasure to those who are\r\nthe least offenders. For the greater ones, who deserve to lose their\r\nheads, your majesty will do well to dissemble, until you can give them\r\ntheir deserts.\"[581]\r\n\r\nPart of this advice the king accepted; for to dissemble did no violence\r\nto his nature. But the more he reflected on the matter, the more he was\r\nsatisfied that it would be impossible to retain the obnoxious minister\r\nin his place. Yet when he had come to this decision, he still shrunk\r\nfrom announcing it. Months passed, and yet Armenteros, who was to carry\r\nback the royal despatches, was still detained at Madrid. It seemed as if\r\nPhilip here, as on other occasions of less moment, was prepared to leave\r\nevents to take their own course, rather than direct them himself.\r\n\r\nEarly in January, 1564, the duchess of Parma admonished her brother that\r\nthe lords chafed much under his long silence. It was a common opinion,\r\nshe said, that he cared little for Flanders, and that he was under the\r\ninfluence of evil counsellors, who would persuade him to deal with the\r\ncountry as a conquered province. She besought him to answer the letter\r\nof the nobles, and especially to write in affectionate terms to Count\r\nEgmont, who well deserved this for the zeal he had always shown for his\r\nsovereign's interests.[582]\r\n\r\nOne is struck with the tone in which the regent here speaks of one of\r\nthe leaders of the opposition, so little in unison with her former\r\nlanguage. It shows how completely she was now under their influence. In\r\ntruth, however, we see constantly, both in her letters and those of the\r\ncardinal, a more friendly tone of feeling towards Egmont than to either\r\nof his associates. On the score of orthodoxy in matters of religion he\r\nwas unimpeachable. His cordial manners, his free and genial temper,\r\nsecured the sympathy of all with whom he came in contact. It was a\r\ncommon opinion, that it would not be difficult to detach him from the\r\nparty of malecontents with whom his lot was cast. Such were not the\r\nnotions entertained of the prince of Orange.\r\n\r\nIn a letter from Granvelle to Philip, without a date, but written\r\nperhaps about this period,[583] we have portraits, or rather outlines,\r\nof the two great leaders of the opposition, touched with a masterly\r\nhand. Egmont he describes as firm in his faith, loyally disposed, but\r\nunder the evil influence of William. It would not be difficult to win\r\nhim over by flattery and favors.[584] The prince, on the other hand, is\r\na cunning and dangerous enemy, of profound views, boundless ambition,\r\ndifficult to change, and impossible to control.[585] In the latter\r\ncharacter we see the true leader of the revolution.\r\n\r\nDisgusted with the indifference of the king, shown in his\r\nlong-protracted silence, the nobles, notwithstanding the regent's\r\nremonstrances, sent orders to their courier, who had been waiting in\r\nMadrid for the royal despatches, to wait no longer, but return without\r\nthem to the Netherlands.[586] Fortunately Philip now moved, and at the\r\nclose of January, 1564, sent back Armenteros with his instructions to\r\nBrussels. The most important of them was a letter of dismissal to the\r\ncardinal himself. It was very short. \"On considering what you write,\"\r\nsaid the king, \"I deem it best that you should leave the Low Countries\r\nfor some days, and go to Burgundy to see your mother, with the consent\r\nof the duchess of Parma. In this way, both my authority and your own\r\nreputation will be preserved.\"[587]\r\n\r\nIt has been a matter of dispute how far the resignation of the cardinal\r\nwas voluntary. The recent discovery of this letter of Philip determines\r\nthat question.[588] It was by command of the sovereign. Yet that command\r\nwas extorted by necessity, and so given as best to save the feelings and\r\nthe credit of the minister. Neither party anticipated that Granvelle's\r\nabsence would continue for a long time, much less that his dismissal was\r\nfinal. Even when inditing the letter to the cardinal, Philip cherished\r\nthe hope that the necessity for his departure might be avoided\r\naltogether. This appears from the despatches sent at the same time to\r\nthe regent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PHILIP'S LETTER TO GRANVELLE.]\r\n\r\nShortly after his note to Granvelle, on the nineteenth of February,\r\nPhilip wrote an answer to the lords in all the tone of offended\r\nmajesty. He expressed his astonishment that they should have been led,\r\nby any motive whatever, to vacate their seats at the council, where he\r\nhad placed them.[589] They would not fail to return there at once, and\r\nshow that they preferred the public weal to all private\r\nconsiderations.[590] As for the removal of the minister, since they had\r\nnot been pleased to specify any charges against him, the king would\r\ndeliberate further before deciding on the matter. Thus, three weeks\r\nafter Philip had given the cardinal his dismissal, did he write to his\r\nenemies as if the matter were still in abeyance; hoping, it would seem,\r\nby the haughty tone of authority, to rebuke the spirit of the refractory\r\nnobles, and intimidate them into a compliance with his commands. Should\r\nthis policy succeed, the cardinal might still hold the helm of\r\ngovernment.[591]\r\n\r\nBut Philip had not yet learned that he was dealing with men who had\r\nlittle of that spirit of subserviency to which he was accustomed in his\r\nCastilian vassals. The peremptory tone of his letter fired the blood of\r\nthe Flemish lords, who at once waited on the regent, and announced their\r\npurpose not to reënter the council. The affair was not likely to end\r\nhere; and Margaret saw with alarm the commotion that would be raised\r\nwhen the letter of the king should be laid before the whole body of the\r\nnobles.[592] Fearing some rash step, difficult to be retrieved, she\r\nresolved either that the cardinal should announce his intended\r\ndeparture, or that she would do so for him. Philip's experiment had\r\nfailed. Nothing, therefore, remained but for the minister publicly to\r\ndeclare, that, as his brother, the late envoy to France, had returned to\r\nBrussels, he had obtained permission from the regent to accompany him on\r\na visit to their aged mother, whom Granvelle had not seen for fourteen\r\nyears.[593]\r\n\r\nThe news of the minister's resignation and speedy departure spread like\r\nwildfire over the country. The joy was universal; and the wits of the\r\ntime redoubled their activity, assailing the fallen minister with\r\nlibels, lampoons, and caricatures, without end. One of these\r\ncaricatures, thrust into his own hand under the pretence of its being a\r\npetition, represented him as hatching a brood of young bishops, who were\r\ncrawling out of their shells. Hovering above might be seen the figure of\r\nthe Devil; while these words were profanely made to issue from his\r\nmonth: \"This is my son; hear ye him!\"[594]\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that, at a banquet at which many of the Flemish\r\nnobles were present, the talk fell on the expensive habits of the\r\naristocracy, especially as shown in the number and dress of their\r\ndomestics. It was the custom for them to wear showy and very costly\r\nliveries, intimating by the colors the family to which they belonged.\r\nGranvelle had set an example of this kind of ostentation. It was\r\nproposed to regulate their apparel by a more modest and uniform\r\nstandard. The lot fell on Egmont to devise some suitable livery, of the\r\nsimple kind used by the Germans. He proposed a dark-gray habit, which,\r\ninstead of the _aiguillettes_ commonly suspended from the shoulders,\r\nshould have flat pieces of cloth, embroidered with the figure of a head\r\nand a fool's cap. The head was made marvellously like that of the\r\ncardinal, and the cap, being red, was thought to bear much resemblance\r\nto a cardinal's hat. This was enough. The dress was received with\r\nacclamation. The nobles instantly clad their retainers in the new\r\nlivery, which had the advantage of greater economy. It became the badge\r\nof party. The tailors of Brussels could not find time to supply their\r\ncustomers. Instead of being confined to Granvelle, the heads\r\noccasionally bore the features of Arschot, Aremberg, or Viglius, the\r\ncardinal's friends. The duchess at first laughed at the jest, and even\r\nsent some specimens of the embroidery to Philip. But Granvelle looked\r\nmore gravely on the matter, declaring it an insult to the government,\r\nand the king interfered to have the device given up. This was not easy,\r\nfrom the extent to which it had been adopted. But Margaret at length\r\nsucceeded in persuading the lords to take another, not personal in its\r\nnature. The substitute was a sheaf of arrows. Even this was found to\r\nhave an offensive application, as it intimated the league of the nobles.\r\nIt was the origin, it is said, of the device afterwards assumed by the\r\nSeven United Provinces.[595]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HE LEAVES THE NETHERLANDS.]\r\n\r\nOn the thirteenth of March, 1564, Granvelle quitted Brussels,--never to\r\nreturn.[596] \"The joy of the nobles at his departure,\" writes one of the\r\nprivy council, \"was excessive. They seemed like boys let loose from\r\nschool.\"[597] The three lords, members of the council of state, in a\r\nnote to the duchess, declared that they were ready to resume their\r\nplaces at the board; with the understanding, however, that they should\r\nretire whenever the minister returned.[598] Granvelle had given out that\r\nhis absence would be of no long duration. The regent wrote to her\r\nbrother in warm commendation of the lords. It would not do for Granvelle\r\never to return. She was assured by the nobles, if he did return, he\r\nwould risk the loss of his life, and the king the loss of the\r\nNetherlands.[599]\r\n\r\nThe three lords wrote each to Philip, informing him that they had\r\nreëntered the council, and making the most earnest protestations of\r\nloyalty. Philip, on his part, graciously replied to each, and in\r\nparticular to the prince of Orange, who had intimated that slanderous\r\nreports respecting himself had found their way to the royal ear. The\r\nking declared \"he never could doubt for a moment that William would\r\ncontinue to show the same zeal in his service that he had always done;\r\nand that no one should be allowed to cast a reproach on a person of his\r\nquality, and one whom Philip knew so thoroughly.\"[600] It might almost\r\nseem that a double meaning lurked under this smooth language. But\r\nwhatever may have been felt, no distrust was exhibited on either side.\r\nTo those who looked on the surface only,--and they were a hundred to\r\none,--it seemed as if the dismissal of the cardinal had removed all\r\ndifficulties; and they now confidently relied on a state of permanent\r\ntranquillity. But there were others whose eyes looked deeper than the\r\ncalm sunshine that lay upon the surface; who saw, more distinctly than\r\nwhen the waters were ruffled by the tempest, the rocks beneath, on which\r\nthe vessel of state was afterward to be wrecked.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal, on leaving the Low Countries, retired to his patrimonial\r\nestate at Besançon,--embellished with all that wealth and a cultivated\r\ntaste could supply. In this pleasant retreat the discomfited statesman\r\nfound a solace in those pursuits which in earlier, perhaps happier, days\r\nhad engaged his attention.[601] He had particularly a turn for the\r\nphysical sciences. But he was fond of letters, and in all his tastes\r\nshowed the fruits of a liberal culture. He surrounded himself with\r\nscholars and artists, and took a lively interest in their pursuits.\r\nJustus Lipsius, afterwards so celebrated, was his secretary. He gave\r\nencouragement to Plantin, who rivalled in Flanders the fame of the Aldi\r\nin Venice. His generous patronage was readily extended to genius, in\r\nwhatever form it was displayed. It is some proof how widely extended,\r\nthat, in the course of his life, he is said to have received more than a\r\nhundred dedications. Though greedy of wealth, it was not to hoard it,\r\nand his large revenues were liberally dispensed in the foundation of\r\nmuseums, colleges, and public libraries. Besançon, the place of his\r\nresidence, did not profit least by this munificence.[602]\r\n\r\nSuch is the portrait which historians have given to us of the minister\r\nin his retirement. His own letters show that, with these sources of\r\nenjoyment, he did not altogether disdain others of a less spiritual\r\ncharacter. A letter to one of the regent's secretaries, written soon\r\nafter the cardinal's arrival at Besançon, concludes in the following\r\nmanner: \"I know that God will recompense men according to their deserts.\r\nI have confidence that he will aid me; and that I shall yet be able to\r\ndraw profit from what my enemies designed for my ruin. This is my\r\nphilosophy, with which I endeavor to live as joyously as I can, laughing\r\nat the world, its calumnies and its passions.\"[603]\r\n\r\nWith all this happy mixture of the Epicurean and the Stoic, the\r\nphilosophic statesman did not so contentedly submit to his fate as to\r\nforego the hope of seeing himself soon reinstated in authority in the\r\nNetherlands. \"In the course of two months,\" he writes, \"you may expect\r\nto see me there.\"[604] He kept up an active correspondence with the\r\nfriends whom he had left in Brussels, and furnished the results of the\r\ninformation thus obtained, with his own commentaries, to the court at\r\nMadrid. His counsel was courted, and greatly considered, by Philip; so\r\nthat from the shades of his retirement the banished minister was still\r\nthought to exercise an important influence on the destiny of Flanders.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     A singular history is attached to the papers of Granvelle. That\r\n     minister resembled his master, Philip the Second, in the fertility\r\n     of his epistolary vein. That the king had a passion for writing,\r\n     notwithstanding he could throw the burden of the correspondence,\r\n     when it suited him, on the other party, is proved by the quantity\r\n     of letters he left behind him. The example of the monarch seems to\r\n     have had its influence on his courtiers; and no reign of that time\r\n     is illustrated by a greater amount of written materials from the\r\n     hands of the principal actors in it. Far from a poverty of\r\n     materials, therefore, the historian has much more reason to\r\n     complain of an _embarras de richesses_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE GRANVELLE PAPERS.]\r\n\r\n     Granvelle filled the highest posts in different parts of the\r\n     Spanish empire; and in each of these--in the Netherlands, where he\r\n     was minister, in Naples, where he was viceroy, in Spain, where he\r\n     took the lead in the cabinet, and in Besançon, whither he retired\r\n     from public life--he left ample memorials under his own hand of his\r\n     residence there. This was particularly the case with Besançon, his\r\n     native town, and the favorite residence to which he turned, as he\r\n     tells us, from the turmoil of office to enjoy the sweets of\r\n     privacy,--yet not, in truth, so sweet to him as the stormy career\r\n     of the statesman, to judge from the tenacity with which he clung to\r\n     office.\r\n\r\n     The cardinal made his library at Besançon the depository, not\r\n     merely of his own letters, but of such as were addressed to him. He\r\n     preserved them all, however humble the sources whence they came,\r\n     and, like Philip, he was in the habit of jotting down his own\r\n     reflections in the margin. As Granvelle's personal and political\r\n     relations connected him with the most important men of his time, we\r\n     may well believe that the mass of correspondence which he gathered\r\n     together was immense. Unfortunately, at his death, instead of\r\n     bequeathing his manuscripts to some public body, who might have\r\n     been responsible for the care of them, he left them to heirs who\r\n     were altogether ignorant of their value. In the course of time the\r\n     manuscripts found their way to the garret, where they soon came to\r\n     be regarded as little better than waste paper. They were pilfered\r\n     by the children and domestics, and a considerable quantity was sent\r\n     off to a neighboring grocer, who soon converted the correspondence\r\n     of the great statesman into wrapping-paper for his spices.\r\n\r\n     From this ignominious fate the residue of the collection was\r\n     happily rescued by the generous exertions of the Abbé Boissot. This\r\n     excellent and learned man was the head of the Benedictines of St.\r\n     Vincent in Besançon, of which town he was himself a native. He was\r\n     acquainted with the condition of the Granvelle papers, and\r\n     comprehended their importance. In the course of eighty years, which\r\n     had elapsed since the cardinal's death, his manuscripts had come to\r\n     be distributed among several heirs, some of whom consented to\r\n     transfer their property gratuitously to the Abbé Boissot, while he\r\n     purchased that of others. In this way he at length succeeded in\r\n     gathering together all that survived of the large collection; and\r\n     he made it the great business of his subsequent life to study its\r\n     contents and arrange the chaotic mass of papers with reference to\r\n     their subjects. To complete his labors, he caused the manuscripts\r\n     thus arranged to be bound, in eighty-two volumes, folio, thus\r\n     placing them in that permanent form which might best secure them\r\n     against future accident.\r\n\r\n     The abbé did not live to publish to the world an account of his\r\n     collection, which at his death passed by his will to his brethren\r\n     of the abbey of St. Vincent, on condition that it should be for\r\n     ever open for the use of the town of Besançon. It may seem strange\r\n     that, notwithstanding the existence of this valuable body of\r\n     original documents was known to scholars, they should so rarely\r\n     have resorted to it for instruction. Its secluded situation, in the\r\n     heart of a remote province, was doubtless regarded as a serious\r\n     obstacle by the historical inquirer, in an age when the public took\r\n     things too readily on trust to be very solicitous about authentic\r\n     sources of information. It is more strange that Boissot's\r\n     Benedictine brethren should have shown themselves so insensible to\r\n     the treasures under their own roof. One of their body, Dom Prosper\r\n     l'Evesque, did indeed profit by the Boissot collection to give to\r\n     the world his Mémoires de Granvelle, a work in two volumes,\r\n     duodecimo, which, notwithstanding the materials at the writer's\r\n     command, contain little of any worth, unless it be an occasional\r\n     extract from Granvelle's own correspondence.\r\n\r\n     At length, in 1834, the subject drew the attention of M. Guizot,\r\n     then Minister of Public Instruction in France. By his direction a\r\n     commission of five scholars was instituted, with the learned Weiss\r\n     at its head, for the purpose of examining the Granvelle papers,\r\n     with a view to their immediate publication. The work was performed\r\n     in a prompt and accurate manner, that must have satisfied its\r\n     enlightened projector. In 1839 the whole series of papers had been\r\n     subjected to a careful analysis, and the portion selected that was\r\n     deemed proper for publication. The first volume appeared in 1841;\r\n     and the president of the commission, M. Weiss, expressed in his\r\n     preface the confident hope that in the course of 1843 the remaining\r\n     papers would all be given to the press. But these anticipations\r\n     have not been realized. In 1854 only nine volumes had appeared. How\r\n     far the publication has since advanced I am ignorant.\r\n\r\n     The Papiers d'Etat, besides Granvelle's own letters, contain a\r\n     large amount of historical materials, such as official documents,\r\n     state papers, and diplomatic correspondence of foreign\r\n     ministers,--that of Renard, for example, so often quoted in these\r\n     pages. There are, besides, numerous letters both of Philip and of\r\n     Charles the Fifth, for the earlier volumes embrace the times of the\r\n     emperor.--The minister's own correspondence is not the least\r\n     valuable part of the collection. Granvelle stood so high in the\r\n     confidence of his sovereign, that, when not intrusted himself with\r\n     the conduct of affairs, ha was constantly consulted by the king as\r\n     to the best mode of conducting them. With a different fate from\r\n     that of most ministers, he retained his influence when he had lost\r\n     his place. Thus there were few transactions of any moment in which\r\n     he was not called on directly or indirectly to take part. And his\r\n     letters furnish a clew for conducting the historical student\r\n     through more than one intricate negotiation, by revealing the true\r\n     motives of the parties who were engaged in it.\r\n\r\n     Granvelle was in such intimate relations with the most eminent\r\n     persons of the time, that his correspondence becomes in some sort\r\n     the mirror of the age, reflecting the state of opinion on the\r\n     leading topics of the day. For the same reason it is replete with\r\n     matters of personal as well as political interest; while the range\r\n     of its application, far from being confined to Spain, embraces most\r\n     of the states of Europe with which Spain held intercourse. The\r\n     French government has done good service by the publication of a\r\n     work which contains so much for the illustration of the history of\r\n     the sixteenth century. M. Weiss, the editor, has conducted his\r\n     labors on the true principles by which an editor should be guided;\r\n     and, far from magnifying his office, and unseasonably obtruding\r\n     himself on the reader's attention, he has sought only to explain\r\n     what is obscure in the text, and to give such occasional notices of\r\n     the writers as may enable the reader to understand their\r\n     correspondence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nCHANGES DEMANDED BY THE LORDS.\r\n\r\nPolicy of Philip.--Ascendancy of the Nobles.--The Regent's\r\nEmbarrassments.--Egmont sent to Spain.\r\n\r\n1564, 1565.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at an epoch in the history of the revolution, when,\r\nthe spirit of the nation having been fully roused, the king had been\r\ncompelled to withdraw his unpopular minister, and to intrust the reins\r\nof government to the hands of the nobles. Before proceeding further, it\r\nwill be well to take a brief survey of the ground, that we may the\r\nbetter comprehend the relations in which the parties stood to each other\r\nat the commencement of the contest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ASCENDANCY OF THE NOBLES.]\r\n\r\nIn a letter to his sister, the regent, written some two years after this\r\nperiod, Philip says: \"I have never had any other object in view than the\r\ngood of my subjects. In all that I have done, I have but trod in the\r\nfootsteps of my father, under whom the people of the Netherlands must\r\nadmit they lived contented and happy. As to the Inquisition, whatever\r\npeople may say of it, I have never attempted anything new. With regard\r\nto the edicts, I have been always resolved to live and die in the\r\nCatholic faith. I could not be content to have my subjects do otherwise.\r\nYet I see not how this can be compassed without punishing the\r\ntransgressors. God knows how willingly I would avoid shedding a drop of\r\nChristian blood,--above all, that of my people in the Netherlands; and\r\nI should esteem it one of the happiest circumstances of my reign to be\r\nspared this necessity.\"[605]\r\n\r\nWhatever we may think of the sensibility of Philip, or of his tenderness\r\nfor his Flemish subjects in particular, we cannot deny that the policy\r\nhe had hitherto pursued was substantially that of his father. Yet his\r\nfather lived beloved, and died lamented, by the Flemings; while Philip's\r\ncourse, from the very first, had encountered only odium and opposition.\r\nA little reflection will show us the reasons of these different results.\r\n\r\nBoth Charles and Philip came forward as the great champions of\r\nCatholicism. But the emperor's zeal was so far tempered by reason, that\r\nit could accommodate itself to circumstances. He showed this on more\r\nthan one occasion, both in Germany and in Flanders. Philip, on the other\r\nhand, admitted of no compromise. He was the inexorable foe of heresy.\r\nPersecution was his only remedy, and the Inquisition the weapon on which\r\nhe relied. His first act on setting foot on his native shore was to\r\nassist at an _auto da fé_. This proclaimed his purpose to the world, and\r\nassociated his name indelibly with that of the terrible tribunal.\r\n\r\nThe free people of the Netherlands felt the same dread of the\r\nInquisition that a free and enlightened people of our own day might be\r\nsupposed to feel. They looked with gloomy apprehension to the\r\nunspeakable misery it was to bring to their firesides, and the\r\ndesolation and ruin to their country. Everything that could in any way\r\nbe connected with it took the dismal coloring of their fears. The edicts\r\nof Charles the Fifth, written in blood, became yet more formidable, as\r\ndeclaring the penalties to be inflicted by this tribunal. Even the\r\nerection of the bishoprics, so necessary a measure, was regarded with\r\ndistrust on account of the inquisitorial powers which of old were vested\r\nin the bishops, thus seeming to give additional strength to the arm of\r\npersecution. The popular feeling was nourished by every new convert to\r\nthe Protestant faith, as well as by those who, from views of their own,\r\nwere willing to fan the flame of rebellion.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why Philip's policy met with greater opposition than that\r\nof his predecessor was the change in the condition of the people\r\nthemselves. Under the general relaxation of the law, or rather of its\r\nexecution, in the latter days of Charles the Fifth, the number of the\r\nReformers had greatly multiplied. Calvinism predominated in Luxemburg,\r\nArtois, Flanders, and the states lying nearest to France. Holland,\r\nZealand, and the North, were the chosen abode of the Anabaptists. The\r\nLutherans swarmed in the districts bordering on Germany; while Antwerp,\r\nthe commercial capital of Brabant, and the great mart of all nations,\r\nwas filled with sectaries of every description. Even the Jew, the butt\r\nof persecution in the Middle Ages, is said to have lived there\r\nunmolested. For such a state of things, it is clear that very different\r\nlegislation was demanded than for that which existed under Charles the\r\nFifth. It was one thing to eradicate a few noxious weeds, and quite\r\nanother to crush the sturdy growth of heresy, which in every direction\r\nnow covered the land.\r\n\r\nA further reason for the aversion to Philip, and one that cannot be too\r\noften repeated, was that he was a foreigner. Charles was a native\r\nFleming; and much may be forgiven in a countryman. But Philip was a\r\nSpaniard,--one of a nation held in greatest aversion by the men of the\r\nNetherlands. It should clearly have been his policy, therefore, to cover\r\nup this defect in the eyes of the inhabitants by consulting their\r\nnational prejudices, and by a show, at least, of confidence in their\r\nleaders. Far from this, Philip began with placing a Spanish army on\r\ntheir borders in time of peace. The administration he committed to the\r\nhands of a foreigner. And while he thus outraged the national feeling at\r\nhome, it was remarked that into the royal council at Madrid, where the\r\naffairs of the Low Countries, as of the other provinces, were settled in\r\nthe last resort, not a Fleming was admitted.[606] The public murmured.\r\nThe nobles remonstrated and resisted. Philip was obliged to retrace his\r\nsteps. He made first one concession, then another. He recalled his\r\ntroops, removed his minister. The nobles triumphed, and the\r\nadministration of the country passed into their hands. People thought\r\nthe troubles were at an end. They were but begun. Nothing had been done\r\ntowards the solution of the great problem of the rights of conscience.\r\nOn this the king and the country were at issue as much as ever. All that\r\nhad been done had only cleared the way to the free discussion of this\r\nquestion, and to the bloody contest that was to follow.\r\n\r\nOn the departure of Granvelle, the discontented lords, as we have seen,\r\nagain took their seats in the council of state. They gave the most\r\nearnest assurances of loyalty to the king, and seemed as if desirous to\r\nmake amends for the past by an extraordinary devotion to public\r\nbusiness. Margaret received these advances in the spirit in which they\r\nwere made; and the confidence which she had formerly bestowed on\r\nGranvelle, she now transferred in full measure to his successful\r\nrivals.[607]\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to read her letters at this period, and to compare them\r\nwith those which she wrote to Philip the year preceding. In the new\r\ncoloring given to the portraits it is hard to recognize a single\r\nindividual. She cannot speak too highly of the services of the\r\nlords,--of the prince of Orange, and Egmont above all,--of their\r\ndevotion to the public weal and the interests of the sovereign. She begs\r\nher brother again and again to testify his own satisfaction by the most\r\ngracious letters to those nobles that he can write.[608] The suggestion\r\nseems to have met with little favor from Philip. No language, however,\r\nis quite strong enough to express Margaret's disgust with the character\r\nand conduct of her former minister, Granvelle. It is he that has so long\r\nstood betwixt the monarch and the love of the people. She cannot feel\r\neasy that he should still remain so near the Netherlands. He should be\r\nsent to Rome.[609] She distrusts his influence, even now, over the\r\ncabinet at Madrid. He is perpetually talking, she understands, of the\r\nprobability of his speedy return to Brussels. The rumor of this causes\r\ngreat uneasiness in the country. Should he be permitted to return, it\r\nwould undoubtedly be the signal for an insurrection.[610]--It is clear\r\nthe duchess had sorely suffered from the tyranny of Granvelle.[611]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ASCENDANCY OF THE NOBLES.]\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the perfect harmony which subsisted between Margaret\r\nand the principal lords, it was soon seen that the wheels of government\r\nwere not destined to run on too smoothly. Although the cardinal was\r\ngone, there still remained a faction of _Cardinalists_, who represented\r\nhis opinions, and who, if few in number, made themselves formidable by\r\nthe strength of their opposition. At the head of these were the viscount\r\nde Barlaimont and the President Viglius.\r\n\r\nThe former, head of the council of finance, was a Flemish noble of the\r\nfirst class,--yet more remarkable for his character than for his rank.\r\nHe was a man of unimpeachable integrity, stanch in his loyalty both to\r\nthe Church and to the crown, with a resolute spirit not to be shaken,\r\nfor it rested on principle.\r\n\r\nHis coadjutor, Viglius, was an eminent jurist, an able writer, a\r\nsagacious statesman. He had been much employed by the emperor in public\r\naffairs, which he managed with a degree of caution that amounted almost\r\nto timidity. He was the personal friend of Granvelle, had adopted his\r\nviews, and carried on with him a constant correspondence, which is among\r\nour best sources of information. He was frugal and moderate in his\r\nhabits, not provoking criticism, like that minister, by his ostentation\r\nand irregularities of life. But he was nearly as formidable, from the\r\nofficial powers with which he was clothed, and the dogged tenacity with\r\nwhich he clung to his purposes. He filled the high office of president\r\nboth of the privy council and of the council of state, and was also\r\nkeeper of the great seal. It was thus obviously in his power to oppose a\r\ngreat check to the proceedings of the opposite party. That he did thus\r\noften thwart them is attested by the reiterated complaints of the\r\nduchess. \"The president,\" she tells her brother, \"makes me endure the\r\npains of hell by the manner in which he traverses my measures.\"[612] His\r\nreal object, like that of Granvelle and of their followers, she says on\r\nanother occasion, is to throw the country into disorder. They would find\r\ntheir account in fishing in the troubled waters. They dread a state of\r\ntranquillity, which would afford opportunity for exposing their corrupt\r\npractices in the government.[613]\r\n\r\nTo these general charges of delinquency the duchess added others, of a\r\nmore vulgar peculation. Viglius, who had taken priest's orders for the\r\npurpose, was provost of the church of St. Bavon. Margaret openly accused\r\nhim of purloining the costly tapestries, the plate, the linen, the\r\njewels, and even considerable sums of money belonging to the\r\nchurch.[614] She insisted on the impropriety of allowing such a man to\r\nhold office under the government.\r\n\r\nNor was the president silent on his part, and in his correspondence with\r\nGranvelle he retorts similar accusations in full measure on his enemies.\r\nHe roundly taxes the great nobles with simony and extortion. Offices,\r\nboth ecclesiastical and secular, were put up for sale in a shameless\r\nmanner, and disposed of to the highest bidder. It was in this way that\r\nthe bankrupt nobles paid their debts, by bestowing vacant places on\r\ntheir creditors. Nor are the regent's hands, he intimates, altogether\r\nclean from the stain of these transactions.[615] He accuses the lords,\r\nmoreover, of using their authority to interfere perpetually with the\r\ncourse of justice. They had acquired an unbounded ascendancy over\r\nMargaret, and treated her with a deference which, he adds, \"is ever sure\r\nto captivate the sex.\"[616] She was more especially under the influence\r\nof her secretary, Armenteros, a creature of the nobles, who profited by\r\nhis position to fill his own coffers at the expense of the\r\nexchequer.[617] For himself, he is in such disgrace for his resistance\r\nto these disloyal proceedings, that the duchess excludes him as far as\r\npossible from the management of affairs, and treats him with undisguised\r\ncoldness. Nothing but the desire to do his duty would induce him to\r\nremain a day longer in a post like this, from which his only wish is\r\nthat his sovereign would release him.[618]\r\n\r\nThe president seems never to have written directly to Philip. It would\r\nonly expose him, he said, to the suspicions and the cavils of his\r\nenemies. The wary statesman took warning by the fate of Granvelle. But\r\nas his letters to the banished minister were all forwarded to Philip,\r\nthe monarch, with the despatches of his sister before him, had the means\r\nof contemplating both sides of the picture, and of seeing that, to\r\nwhichever party he intrusted the government, the interests of the\r\ncountry were little likely to be served. Had it been his father, the\r\nemperor, who was on the throne, such knowledge would not have been in\r\nhis possession four and twenty hours, before he would have been on his\r\nway to the Netherlands. But Philip was of a more sluggish temper. He was\r\ncapable, indeed, of much passive exertion,--of incredible toil in the\r\ncabinet,--and from his palace, as was said, would have given law to\r\nChristendom. But rather than encounter the difficulties of a voyage, he\r\nwas willing, it appears, to risk the loss of the finest of his\r\nprovinces.[619]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ASCENDANCY OF THE NOBLES.]\r\n\r\nYet he wrote to his sister to encourage her with the prospect of his\r\nvisiting the country as soon as he could be released from a war in which\r\nhe was engaged with the Turks. He invited her, at the same time, to\r\nsend him further particulars of the misconduct of Viglius, and expressed\r\nthe hope that some means might be found of silencing his\r\nopposition.[620]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy at this day to strike the balance between the hostile\r\nparties, so as to decide on the justice of these mutual accusations, and\r\nto assign to each the proper share of responsibility for the\r\nmismanagement of the government. That it was mismanaged is certain. That\r\noffices were put up for sale is undeniable; for the duchess frankly\r\ndiscusses the expediency of it, in a letter to her brother. This, at\r\nleast, absolves the act from the imputation of secrecy. The conflict of\r\nthe council of state with the two other councils often led to disorders,\r\nsince the decrees passed by the privy council, which had cognizance of\r\nmatters of justice, were frequently frustrated by the amnesties and\r\npardons granted by the council of state. To remedy this, the nobles\r\ncontended that it was necessary to subject the decrees of the other\r\ncouncils to the revision of the council of state, and, in a word, to\r\nconcentrate in this last body the whole authority of government.[621]\r\nThe council of state, composed chiefly of the great aristocracy, looked\r\ndown with contempt on those subordinate councils, made up for the most\r\npart of men of humbler condition, pledged by their elevation to office\r\nto maintain the interests of the crown. They would have placed the\r\nadministration of the country in the hands of an oligarchy, made up of\r\nthe great Flemish nobles. This would be to break up that system of\r\ndistribution into separate departments established by Charles the Fifth\r\nfor the more perfect despatch of business. It would, in short, be such a\r\nchange in the constitution of the country as would of itself amount to a\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nIn the state of things above described, the Reformation gained rapidly\r\nin the country. The nobles generally, as has been already intimated,\r\nwere loyal to the Roman Catholic Church. Many of the younger nobility,\r\nhowever, who had been educated at Geneva, returned tinctured with\r\nheretical doctrines from the school of Calvin.[622] But whether Catholic\r\nor Protestant, the Flemish aristocracy looked with distrust on the\r\nsystem of persecution, and held the Inquisition in the same abhorrence\r\nas did the great body of the people. It was fortunate for the\r\nReformation in the Netherlands, that at its outset it received the\r\nsupport even of the Catholics, who resisted the Inquisition as an\r\noutrage on their political liberties.\r\n\r\nUnder the lax administration of the edicts, exiles who had fled abroad\r\nfrom persecution now returned to Flanders. Calvinist ministers and\r\nrefugees from France crossed the borders, and busied themselves with the\r\nwork of proselytism. Seditious pamphlets were circulated, calling on the\r\nregent to confiscate the ecclesiastical revenues, and apply them to the\r\nuse of the state, as had been done in England.[623] The Inquisition\r\nbecame an object of contempt, almost as much as of hatred. Two of the\r\nprincipal functionaries wrote to Philip, that, without further support,\r\nthey could be of no use in a situation which exposed them only to\r\nderision and danger.[624] At Bruges and at Brussels the mob entered the\r\nprisons, and released the prisoners. A more flagrant violation of\r\njustice occurred at Antwerp. A converted friar, named Fabricius, who had\r\nbeen active in preaching and propagating the new doctrines, was tried\r\nand sentenced to the stake. On the way to execution, the people called\r\nout to him, from the balconies and the doorways, to \"take courage, and\r\nendure manfully to the last.\"[625] When the victim was bound to the\r\nstake, and the pile was kindled, the mob discharged such a volley of\r\nstones at the officers as speedily put them to flight. But the unhappy\r\nman, though unscathed by the fire, was stabbed to the heart by the\r\nexecutioner, who made his escape in the tumult. The next morning,\r\nplacards written in blood were found affixed to the public buildings,\r\nthreatening vengeance on all who had any part in the execution of\r\nFabricius; and one of the witnesses against him, a woman, hardly escaped\r\nwith life from the hands of the populace.[626]\r\n\r\nThe report of these proceedings caused a great sensation at Madrid; and\r\nPhilip earnestly called on his sister to hunt out and pursue the\r\noffenders. This was not easy, where most, even of those who did not join\r\nin the act, fully shared in the feeling which led to it. Yet Philip\r\ncontinued to urge the necessity of enforcing the laws for the\r\npreservation of the Faith, as the thing dearest to his heart. He would\r\nsometimes indicate in his letters the name of a suspicious individual,\r\nhis usual dress, his habits, and appearance,--descending into details\r\nwhich may well surprise us, considering the multitude of affairs of a\r\nweightier character that pressed upon his mind.[627] One cannot doubt\r\nthat Philip was at heart an inquisitor.\r\n\r\nYet the fires of persecution were not permitted wholly to slumber. The\r\nhistorian of the Reformation enumerates seventeen who suffered capitally\r\nfor their religious opinions in the course of the year 1564.[628] This,\r\nthough pitiable, was a small number--if indeed it be the whole\r\nnumber--compared with the thousands who are said to have perished in the\r\nsame space of time in the preceding reign. It was too small to produce\r\nany effect as a persecution, while the sight of the martyr, singing\r\nhymns in the midst of the flames, only kindled a livelier zeal in the\r\nspectators, and a deeper hatred for their oppressors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE REGENT'S EMBARRASSMENTS.]\r\n\r\nThe finances naturally felt the effects of the general disorder of the\r\ncountry. The public debt, already large, as we have seen, was now so\r\nmuch increased, that the yearly deficiency in the revenue, according to\r\nthe regent's own statement, amounted to six hundred thousand\r\nflorins;[629] and she knew of no way of extricating the country from its\r\nembarrassments, unless the king should come to its assistance. The\r\nconvocation of the states-general was insisted on as the only remedy for\r\nthese disorders. That body alone, it was contended, was authorized to\r\nvote the requisite subsidies, and to redress the manifold grievances of\r\nthe nation.--Yet, in point of fact, its powers had hitherto been little\r\nmore than to propose the subsidies for the approbation of the several\r\nprovinces, and to _remonstrate_ on the grievances of the nation. To\r\ninvest the states-general with the power of _redressing_ these\r\ngrievances would bestow on them legislative functions which they had\r\nrarely, if ever, exercised. This would be to change the constitution of\r\nthe country, by the new weight it would give to the popular element; a\r\nchange which the great lords, who had already the lesser nobles entirely\r\nat their disposal,[630] would probably know well how to turn to\r\naccount.[631] Yet Margaret had now so entirely resigned herself to their\r\ninfluence, that, notwithstanding the obvious consequences of these\r\nmeasures, she recommended to Philip both to assemble the states-general\r\nand to remodel the council of state;[632]--and this to a monarch more\r\njealous of his authority than any other prince in Europe!\r\n\r\nTo add to the existing troubles, orders were received from the court of\r\nMadrid to publish the decrees of the Council of Trent throughout the\r\nNetherlands. That celebrated council had terminated its long session in\r\n1563, with the results that might have been expected,--those of widening\r\nthe breach between Protestant and Catholic, and of enlarging, or at\r\nleast more firmly establishing, the authority of the pope. One good\r\nresult may be mentioned, that of providing for a more strict supervision\r\nof the morals and discipline of the clergy;--a circumstance which caused\r\nthe decrees to be in extremely bad odor with that body.\r\n\r\nIt was hoped that Philip would imitate the example of France, and reject\r\ndecrees which thus exalted the power of the pope. Men were led to expect\r\nthis the more, from the mortification which the king had lately\r\nexperienced from a decision of the pontiff on a question of precedence\r\nbetween the Castilian and French ambassadors at his court. This delicate\r\nmatter, long pending, had been finally determined in favor of France by\r\nPius the Fifth, who may have thought it more politic to secure a fickle\r\nally than to reward a firm one. The decision touched Philip to the\r\nquick. He at once withdrew his ambassador from Rome, and refused to\r\nreceive an envoy from his holiness.[633] It seemed that a serious\r\nrupture was likely to take place between the parties. But it was not in\r\nthe nature of Philip to be long at feud with the court of Rome. In a\r\nletter to the duchess of Parma, dated August 6, 1564, he plainly\r\nintimated that in matters of faith he was willing at all times to\r\nsacrifice his private feelings to the public weal.[634] He subsequently\r\ncommanded the decrees of the Council of Trent to be received as law\r\nthroughout his dominions, saying that he could make no exception for the\r\nNetherlands, when he made none for Spain.[635]\r\n\r\nThe promulgation of the decrees was received, as had been anticipated,\r\nwith general discontent. The clergy complained of the interference with\r\ntheir immunities. The men of Brabant stood stoutly on the chartered\r\nrights secured to them by the \"_Joyeuse Entrée_\". And the people\r\ngenerally resisted the decrees, from a vague idea of their connection\r\nwith the Inquisition; while, as usual when mischief was on foot, they\r\nloudly declaimed against Granvelle as being at the bottom of it.\r\n\r\nIn this unhappy condition of affairs, it was determined by the council\r\nof state to send some one to Madrid to lay the grievances of the nation\r\nbefore the king, and to submit to him what in their opinion would be the\r\nmost effectual remedy. They were the more induced to this by the\r\nunsatisfactory nature of the royal correspondence. Philip, to the great\r\ndiscontent of the lords, had scarcely condescended to notice their\r\nletters.[636] Even to Margaret's ample communications he rarely\r\nresponded, and when he did, it was in vague and general terms, conveying\r\nlittle more than the necessity of executing justice and watching over\r\nthe purity of the Faith.\r\n\r\nThe person selected for the unenviable mission to Madrid was Egmont,\r\nwhose sentiments of loyalty, and of devotion to the Catholic faith, it\r\nwas thought, would recommend him to the king; while his brilliant\r\nreputation, his rank, and his popular manners would find favor with the\r\ncourt and the people. Egmont himself was the less averse to the mission,\r\nthat he had some private suits of his own to urge with the monarch.\r\n\r\nThis nomination was warmly supported by William, between whom and the\r\ncount a perfectly good understanding seems to have subsisted, in spite\r\nof the efforts of the Cardinalists to revive their ancient feelings of\r\njealousy. Yet these feelings still glowed in the bosoms of the wives of\r\nthe two nobles, as was evident from the warmth with which they disputed\r\nthe question of precedence with each other. Both were of the highest\r\nrank, and, as there was no umpire to settle the delicate question, it\r\nwas finally arranged by the two ladies appearing in public always arm in\r\narm,--an equality which the haughty dames were careful to maintain, in\r\nspite of the ridiculous embarrassments to which they were occasionally\r\nexposed by narrow passages and doorways.[637] If the question of\r\nprecedence had related to character, it would have been easily settled.\r\nThe troubles from the misconduct of Anne of Saxony bore as heavily on\r\nthe prince, her husband, at this very time, as the troubles of the\r\nstate.[638]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EGMONT SENT TO SPAIN.]\r\n\r\nBefore Egmont's departure, a meeting of the council of state was called,\r\nto furnish him with the proper instructions. The president, Viglius,\r\ngave it as his opinion, that the mission was superfluous; and that the\r\ngreat nobles had only to reform their own way of living to bring about\r\nthe necessary reforms in the country. Egmont was instructed by the\r\nregent to represent to the king the deplorable condition of the land,\r\nthe prostration of public credit, the decay of religion, and the\r\nsymptoms of discontent and disloyalty in the people. As the most\r\neffectual remedy for these evils, he was to urge the king to come in\r\nperson, and that speedily, to Flanders. \"If his majesty does not approve\r\nof this,\" said Margaret, \"impress upon him the necessity of making\r\nfurther remittances, and of giving me precise instructions as to the\r\ncourse I am to pursue.\"[639]\r\n\r\nThe prince of Orange took part in the discussion with a warmth he had\r\nrarely shown. It was time, he said, that the king should be disabused of\r\nthe errors under which he labored with respect to the Netherlands. The\r\nedicts must be mitigated. It was not possible, in the present state of\r\nfeeling, either to execute the edicts or to maintain the\r\nInquisition.[640] The Council of Trent was almost equally odious; nor\r\ncould they enforce its decrees in the Netherlands while the countries on\r\nthe borders rejected them. The people would no longer endure the\r\nperversion of justice, and the miserable wrangling of the\r\ncouncils.--This last blow was aimed at the president.--The only remedy\r\nwas to enlarge the council of state, and to strengthen its authority.\r\nFor his own part, he concluded, he could not understand how any prince\r\ncould claim the right of interfering with the consciences of his\r\nsubjects in matters of religion.[641]--The impassioned tone of his\r\neloquence, so contrary to the usually calm manner of William the Silent,\r\nand the boldness with which he avowed his opinions, caused a great\r\nsensation in the assembly.[642] That night was passed by Viglius, who\r\ngives his own account of the matter, in tossing on his bed, painfully\r\nruminating on his forlorn position in the council, with scarcely one to\r\nsupport him in the contest which he was compelled to wage, not merely\r\nwith the nobles, but with the regent herself. The next morning, while\r\ndressing, he was attacked by a fit of apoplexy, which partially deprived\r\nhim of the use of both his speech and his limbs.[643] It was some time\r\nbefore he could resume his place at the board. This new misfortune\r\nfurnished him with a substantial argument for soliciting the king's\r\npermission to retire from office. In this he was warmly seconded by\r\nMargaret, who, while she urged the president's incapacity, nothing\r\ntouched by his situation, eagerly pressed her brother to call him to\r\naccount for his delinquencies, and especially his embezzlement of the\r\nchurch property.[644]\r\n\r\nPhilip, who seems to have shunned any direct intercourse with his\r\nFlemish subjects, had been averse to have Egmont, or any other envoy,\r\nsent to Madrid. On learning that the mission was at length settled, he\r\nwrote to Margaret that he had made up his mind to receive the count\r\ngraciously, and to show no discontent with the conduct of the lords.\r\nThat the journey, however, was not without its perils, may be inferred\r\nfrom a singular document that has been preserved to us. It is signed by\r\na number of Egmont's personal friends, each of whom traced his signature\r\nin his own blood. In this paper the parties pledge their faith, as true\r\nknights and gentlemen, that if any harm be done to Count Egmont during\r\nhis absence, they will take ample vengeance on Cardinal Granvelle, or\r\nwhoever might be the author of it.[645] The cardinal seems to have been\r\nthe personification of evil with the Flemings of every degree. This\r\ninstrument, which was deposited with the Countess Egmont, was subscribed\r\nwith the names of seven nobles, most of them afterwards conspicuous in\r\nthe troubles of the country. One might imagine that such a document was\r\nmore likely to alarm than to reassure the wife to whom it was\r\naddressed.[646]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of January, Egmont set out on his journey. He was\r\naccompanied for some distance by a party of his friends, who at Cambray\r\ngave him a splendid entertainment. Among those present was the\r\narchbishop of Cambray, a prelate who had made himself unpopular by the\r\nzeal he had shown in the persecution of the Reformers. As the wine-cup\r\npassed freely round, some of the younger guests amused themselves with\r\nfrequently pledging the prelate, and endeavoring to draw him into a\r\ngreater degree of conviviality than was altogether becoming his station.\r\nAs he at length declined their pledges, they began openly to taunt him;\r\nand one of the revellers, irritated by the archbishop's reply, would\r\nhave thrown a large silver dish at his head, had not his arm been\r\narrested by Egmont. Another of the company, however, succeeded in\r\nknocking off the prelate's cap;[647] and a scene of tumult ensued, from\r\nwhich the archbishop was extricated, not without difficulty, by the more\r\nsober and considerate part of the company. The whole affair--mortifying\r\nin the extreme to Egmont--is characteristic of the country at this\r\nperiod; when business of the greatest importance was settled at the\r\nbanquet, as we often find in the earlier history of the revolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EGMONT SENT TO SPAIN.]\r\n\r\nEgmont's reception at Madrid was of the most flattering kind. Philip's\r\ndemeanor towards his great vassal was marked by unusual benignity; and\r\nthe courtiers, readily taking their cue from their sovereign, vied with\r\none another in attentions to the man whose prowess might be said to have\r\nwon for Spain the great victories of Gravelines and St. Quentin. In\r\nfine, Egmont, whose brilliant exterior and noble bearing gave additional\r\nlustre to his reputation, was the object of general admiration during\r\nhis residence of several weeks at Madrid. It seemed as if the court of\r\nCastile was prepared to change its policy, from the flattering\r\nattentions it thus paid to the representative of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay, Egmont was admitted to several audiences, in which he\r\nexposed to the monarch the evils that beset the country, and the\r\nmeasures proposed for relieving them. As the two most effectual, he\r\npressed him to mitigate the edicts, and to reorganize the council of\r\nstate.[648] Philip listened with much benignity to these suggestions of\r\nthe Flemish noble; and if he did not acquiesce, he gave no intimation to\r\nthe contrary, except by assuring the count of his determination to\r\nmaintain the integrity of the Catholic faith. To Egmont personally he\r\nshowed the greatest indulgence, and the count's private suits sped as\r\nfavorably as he could have expected. But a remarkable anecdote proves\r\nthat Philip, at this very time, with all this gracious demeanor, had not\r\nreceded one step from the ground he had always occupied.\r\n\r\nNot long after Egmont's arrival, Philip privately called a meeting of\r\nthe most eminent theologians in the capital. To this conclave he\r\ncommunicated briefly the state of the Low Countries, and their demand to\r\nenjoy freedom of conscience in matters of religion. He concluded by\r\ninquiring the opinion of his auditors on the subject. The reverend body,\r\ndoubtless supposing that the king only wanted their sanction to\r\nextricate himself from the difficulties of his position, made answer,\r\n\"that, considering the critical situation of Flanders, and the imminent\r\ndanger, if thwarted, of its disloyalty to the crown and total defection\r\nfrom the Church, he might be justified in allowing the people freedom of\r\nworshipping in their own way.\" To this Philip sternly replied, \"He had\r\nnot called them to learn whether he _might_ grant this to the Flemings,\r\nbut whether he _must_ do so.\"[649] The flexible conclave, finding they\r\nhad mistaken their cue, promptly answered in the negative; on which\r\nPhilip, prostrating himself on the ground before a crucifix, exclaimed,\r\n\"I implore thy divine majesty, Ruler of all things, that thou keep me in\r\nthe mind that I am in, never to allow myself either to become or to be\r\ncalled the lord of those who reject thee for their Lord.\"[650]--The\r\nstory was told to the historian who records it by a member of the\r\nassembly, filled with admiration at the pious zeal of the monarch! From\r\nthat moment the doom of the Netherlands was sealed.\r\n\r\nYet Egmont had so little knowledge of the true state of things, that he\r\nindulged in the most cheerful prognostications for the future. His frank\r\nand cordial nature readily responded to the friendly demonstrations he\r\nreceived, and his vanity was gratified by the homage universally paid to\r\nhim. On leaving the country, he made a visit to the royal residences of\r\nSegovia and of the Escorial,--the magnificent pile already begun by\r\nPhilip, and which continued to occupy more or less of his time during\r\nthe remainder of his reign. Egmont, in a letter addressed to the king,\r\ndeclares himself highly delighted with what he has seen at both these\r\nplaces, and assures his sovereign that he returns to Flanders the most\r\ncontented man in the world.[651]\r\n\r\nWhen arrived there, early in April, 1565, the count was loud in his\r\nprofession of the amiable dispositions of the Castilian court towards\r\nthe Netherlands. Egmont's countrymen--William of Orange and a few\r\npersons of cooler judgment alone excepted--readily indulged in the same\r\ndream of sanguine expectation, flattering themselves with the belief\r\nthat a new policy was to prevail at Madrid, and that their country was\r\nhenceforth to thrive under the blessings of religious toleration.--It\r\nwas a pleasing illusion, destined to be of no long duration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nPHILIP'S INFLEXIBILITY.\r\n\r\nPhilip's Duplicity.--His Procrastination.--Despatches from\r\nSegovia.--Effect on the Country.--The Compromise.--Orange and Egmont.\r\n\r\n1565, 1566.\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after Egmont's return to Brussels, Margaret called a meeting of\r\nthe council of state, at which the sealed instructions brought by the\r\nenvoy from Madrid were opened and read. They began by noticing the\r\ncount's demeanor in terms so flattering as showed the mission had proved\r\nacceptable to the king. Then followed a declaration, strongly expressed\r\nand sufficiently startling. \"I would rather lose a hundred thousand\r\nlives, if I had so many,\" said the monarch, \"than allow a single change\r\nin matters of religion.\"[652] He, however, recommended that a commission\r\nbe appointed, consisting of three bishops with a number of jurists, who\r\nshould advise with the members of the council as to the best mode of\r\ninstructing the people, especially in their spiritual concerns. It might\r\nbe well, moreover, to substitute some secret methods for the public\r\nforms of execution, which now enabled the heretic to assume to himself\r\nthe glory of martyrdom, and thereby produce a mischievous impression on\r\nthe people.[653] No other allusion was made to the pressing grievances\r\nof the nation, though, in a letter addressed at the same time to the\r\nduchess, Philip said that he had come to no decision as to the council\r\nof state, where the proposed change seemed likely to be attended with\r\ninconvenience.[654]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PHILIP'S DUPLICITY.]\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the result of Egmont's mission to Madrid! This the\r\nchange so much vaunted in the policy of Philip! \"The count has been the\r\ndupe of Spanish cunning,\" exclaimed the prince of Orange. It was too\r\ntrue; and Egmont felt it keenly, as he perceived the ridicule to which\r\nhe was exposed by the confident tone in which he had talked of the\r\namiable dispositions of the Castilian court, and by the credit he had\r\ntaken to himself for promoting them.[655]\r\n\r\nA greater sensation was produced among the people; for their\r\nexpectations had been far more sanguine than those entertained by\r\nWilliam, and the few who, like him, understood the character of Philip\r\ntoo well to place great confidence in the promises of Egmont. They\r\nloudly declaimed against the king's insincerity, and accused their envoy\r\nof having shown more concern for his private interests than for those of\r\nthe public. This taunt touched the honor of that nobleman, who bitterly\r\ncomplained that it was an artifice of Philip to destroy his credit with\r\nhis countrymen; and the better to prove his good faith, he avowed his\r\npurpose of throwing up at once all the offices he held under\r\ngovernment.[656]\r\n\r\nThe spirit of persecution, after a temporary lull, now again awakened.\r\nBut everywhere the inquisitors were exposed to insult, and met with the\r\nsame resistance as before; while their victims were cheered with\r\nexpressions of sympathy from those who saw them led to execution. To\r\navoid the contagion of example, the executions were now conducted\r\nsecretly in the prisons.[657] But the mystery thus thrown around the\r\nfate of the unhappy sufferer only invested it with an additional horror.\r\nComplaints were made every day to the government by the states, the\r\nmagistrates, and the people, denouncing the persecutions to which they\r\nwere exposed. Spies, they said, were in every house, watching looks,\r\nwords, gestures. No man was secure, either in person or property. The\r\npublic groaned under an intolerable slavery.[658] Meanwhile, the\r\nHuguenot emissaries were busy as ever in propagating their doctrines;\r\nand with the work of reform was mingled the seed of revolution.\r\n\r\nThe regent felt the danger of this state of things, and her impotence to\r\nrelieve it. She did all she could in freely exposing it to Philip,\r\ninforming him at the same time of Egmont's disgust, and the general\r\ndiscontent of the nation, at the instructions from Spain. She ended, as\r\nusual, by beseeching her brother to come himself, if he would preserve\r\nhis authority in the Netherlands.[659] To these communications the royal\r\nanswers came but rarely; and, when they did come, were for the most part\r\nvague and unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\"Everything goes on with Philip,\" writes Chantonnay, formerly minister\r\nto France, to his brother Granvelle,--\"Everything goes on from\r\nto-morrow to to-morrow; the only resolution is, to remain\r\nirresolute.[660] The king will allow matters to become so entangled in\r\nthe Low Countries, that, if he ever should visit them, he will find it\r\neasier to conform to the state of things than to mend it. The lords\r\nthere are more of kings than the king himself.[661] They have all the\r\nsmaller nobles in leading-strings. It is impossible that Philip should\r\nconduct himself like a man.[662] His only object is to cajole the\r\nFlemish nobles, so that he may be spared the necessity of coming to\r\nFlanders.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a pity,\" writes the secretary, Perez, \"that the king will manage\r\naffairs as he does, now taking counsel of this man, and now of that;\r\nconcealing some matters from those he consults, and trusting them with\r\nothers, showing full confidence in no one. With this way of proceeding,\r\nit is no wonder that despatches should be contradictory in their\r\ntenor.\"[663]\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless true, that procrastination and distrust were the\r\nbesetting sins of Philip, and were followed by their natural\r\nconsequences. He had, moreover, as we have seen, a sluggishness of\r\nnature, which kept him in Madrid when he should have been in\r\nBrussels,--where his father, in similar circumstances, would long since\r\nhave been, seeing with his own eyes what Philip saw only with the eyes\r\nof others. But still his policy, in the present instance, may be\r\nreferred quite as much to deliberate calculation as to his natural\r\ntemper. He had early settled it as a fixed principle never to concede\r\nreligious toleration to his subjects. He had intimated this pretty\r\nclearly in his different communications to the government of Flanders.\r\nThat he did not announce it in a more absolute and unequivocal form may\r\nwell have arisen from the apprehension, that, in the present irritable\r\nstate of the people, this might rouse their passions into a flame. At\r\nleast, it might be reserved for a last resort. Meanwhile, he hoped to\r\nweary them out by maintaining an attitude of cold reserve; until,\r\nconvinced of the hopelessness of resistance, they would cease altogether\r\nto resist. In short, he seemed to deal with the Netherlands like a\r\npatient angler, who allows the trout to exhaust himself by his own\r\nefforts, rather than by a violent movement risk the loss of him\r\naltogether. It is clear Philip did not understand the character of the\r\nNetherlander,--as dogged and determined as his own.\r\n\r\nConsidering the natural bent of the king's disposition, there seems no\r\nreason to charge Granvelle, as was commonly done in the Low Countries,\r\nwith having given a direction to his policy. It is, however, certain,\r\nthat, on all great questions, the minister's judgment seems to have\r\nperfectly coincided with that of his master. \"If your majesty mitigates\r\nthe edicts,\" writes the cardinal, \"affairs will become worse in Flanders\r\nthan they are in France.\"[664] No change should be allowed in the\r\ncouncil of state.[665] A meeting of the states-general would inflict an\r\ninjury which the king would feel for thirty years to come![666]\r\nGranvelle maintained a busy correspondence with his partisans in the Low\r\nCountries, and sent the results of it--frequently the original letters\r\nthemselves--to Madrid. Thus Philip, by means of the reports of the\r\ngreat nobles on the one hand, and of the Cardinalists on the other, was\r\nenabled to observe the movements in Flanders from the most opposite\r\npoints of view.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS PROCRASTINATION.]\r\n\r\nThe king's replies to the letters of the minister were somewhat scanty,\r\nto judge from the complaints which Granvelle made of his neglect. With\r\nall this, the cardinal professes to be well pleased that he is rid of so\r\nburdensome an office as that of governing the Netherlands. \"Here,\" he\r\nwrites to his friend Viglius, \"I make good cheer, busying myself with my\r\nown affairs, and preparing my despatches in quiet, seldom leaving the\r\nhouse, except to take a walk, to attend church, or to visit my\r\nmother.\"[667] In this simple way of life, the philosophic statesman\r\nseems to have passed his time to his own satisfaction, though it is\r\nevident, notwithstanding his professions, that he cast many a longing\r\nlook back to the Netherlands, the seat of his brief authority. \"The\r\nhatred the people of Flanders bear me,\" he writes to Philip, \"afflicts\r\nme sorely; but I console myself that it is for the service of God and my\r\nking.\"[668] The cardinal, amid his complaints of the king's neglect,\r\naffected the most entire submission to his will. \"I would go anywhere,\"\r\nhe writes,--\"to the Indies, anywhere in the world,--would even throw\r\nmyself into the fire, did you desire it.\"[669] Philip, not long after,\r\nput these professions to the test. In October, 1565, he yielded to the\r\nregent's importunities, and commanded Granvelle to transfer his\r\nresidence to Rome. The cardinal would not move. \"Anywhere,\" he wrote to\r\nhis master, \"but to Rome. That is a place of ceremonies and empty show,\r\nfor which I am nowise qualified. Besides, it would look too much like a\r\nsubmission on your part. My diocese of Mechlin has need of me; now, if I\r\nshould go to Spain, it would look as if I went to procure the aid which\r\nit so much requires.\"[670] But the cabinet of Madrid were far from\r\ndesiring the presence of so cunning a statesman to direct the royal\r\ncounsels. The orders were reiterated, to go to Rome. To Rome,\r\naccordingly, the reluctant minister went; and we have a letter from him\r\nto the king, dated from that capital, the first of February, 1566, in\r\nwhich he counsels his master by no means to think of introducing the\r\nSpanish Inquisition into the Netherlands.[671] It might seem as if,\r\ncontrary to the proverb, change of climate had wrought some change in\r\nthe disposition of the cardinal.--From this period, Granvelle, so long\r\nthe terror of the Low Countries, disappears from the management of their\r\naffairs. He does not, however, disappear from the political theatre. We\r\nshall again meet with the able and ambitious prelate, first as viceroy\r\nof Naples, and afterwards at Madrid occupying the highest station in the\r\ncouncils of his sovereign.\r\n\r\nEarly in July, 1565, the commission of reform appointed by Philip\r\ntransmitted its report to Spain. It recommended no change in the present\r\nlaws, except so far as to authorize the judges to take into\r\nconsideration the age and sex of the accused, and in case of penitence\r\nto commute the capital punishment of the convicted heretic for\r\nbanishment. Philip approved of the report in all particulars,--except\r\nthe only particular that involved a change, that of mercy to the\r\npenitent heretic.[672]\r\n\r\nAt length, the king resolved on such an absolute declaration of his will\r\nas should put all doubts on the matter at rest, and relieve him from\r\nfurther importunity. On the seventeenth of October, 1565, he addressed\r\nthat memorable letter to his sister, from the Wood of Segovia, which may\r\nbe said to have determined the fate of the Netherlands. Philip, in this,\r\nintimates his surprise that his letters should appear to Egmont\r\ninconsistent with what he had heard from his lips at Madrid. His desire\r\nwas not for novelty in anything. He would have the Inquisition conducted\r\nby the inquisitors, as it had hitherto been, and as by right, divine and\r\nhuman, belonged to them.[673] For the edicts, it was no time in the\r\npresent state of religion to make any change; both his own and those of\r\nhis father must be executed. The Anabaptists--a sect for which, as the\r\nespecial butt of persecution, much intercession had been made--must be\r\ndealt with according to the rigor of the law. Philip concluded by\r\nconjuring the regent and the lords in the council faithfully to obey his\r\ncommands, as in so doing they would render the greatest service to the\r\ncause of religion and of their country,--which last, he adds, without\r\nthe execution of these ordinances, would be of little worth.[674]\r\n\r\nIn a private letter to the regent of nearly the same date with these\r\npublic despatches, Philip speaks of the proposed changes in the council\r\nof state as a subject on which he had not made up his mind.[675] He\r\nnotices also the proposed convocation of the states-general as a thing,\r\nin the present disorders of the country, altogether\r\ninexpedient.[676]--Thus the king's despatches covered nearly all the\r\ndebatable ground on which the contest had been so long going on between\r\nthe crown and the country. There could be no longer any complaint of\r\nambiguity or reserve in the expression of the royal will. \"God knows,\"\r\nwrites Viglius, \"what wry faces were made in the council on learning the\r\nabsolute will of his majesty!\"[677] There was not one of its members,\r\nnot even the president or Barlaimont, who did not feel the necessity of\r\nbending to the tempest so far as to suspend, if not to mitigate, the\r\nrigor of the law. They looked to the future with gloomy apprehension.\r\nViglius strongly urged, that the despatches should not be made public\r\ntill some further communication should be had with Philip to warn him of\r\nthe consequences. In this he was opposed by the prince of Orange. \"It\r\nwas too late,\" he said, \"to talk of what was expedient to be done. Since\r\nthe will of his majesty was so unequivocally expressed, all that\r\nremained for the government was to execute it.\"[678] In vain did Viglius\r\noffer to take the whole responsibility of the delay on himself.\r\nWilliam's opinion, supported by Egmont and Hoorne, prevailed with the\r\nregent, too timid, by such an act of disobedience, to hazard the\r\ndispleasure of her brother. As, late in the evening, the council broke\r\nup, William was heard to exclaim, \"Now we shall see the beginning of a\r\nfine tragedy!\"[679]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EFFECT ON THE COUNTRY.]\r\n\r\nIn the month of December, the regent caused copies of the despatches,\r\nwith extracts from the letters to herself, to be sent to the governors\r\nand the councils of the several provinces, with orders that they should\r\nsee to their faithful execution. Officers, moreover, were to be\r\nappointed, whose duty it was to ascertain the manner in which these\r\norders were fulfilled, and to report thereon to the government.\r\n\r\nThe result was what had been foreseen. The publication of the\r\ndespatches--to borrow the words of a Flemish writer--created a sensation\r\nthroughout the country little short of what would have been caused by a\r\ndeclaration of war.[680] Under every discouragement, men had flattered\r\nthemselves, up to this period, with the expectation of some change for\r\nthe better. The constantly increasing number of the Reformers, the\r\npersevering resistance to the Inquisition, the reiterated remonstrances\r\nto the government, the general persuasion that the great nobles, even\r\nthe regent, were on their side, had all combined to foster the hope that\r\ntoleration, to some extent, would eventually be conceded by Philip.[681]\r\nThis hope was now crushed. Whatever doubts had been entertained were\r\ndispelled by these last despatches, which came like a hurricane,\r\nsweeping away the mists that had so long blinded the eyes of men, and\r\nlaying open the policy of the crown, clear as day, to the dullest\r\napprehension. The people passed to the extremity of despair. The Spanish\r\nInquisition, with its train of horrors, seemed to be already in the\r\nmidst of them. They called to mind all the tales of woe they had heard\r\nof it. They recounted the atrocities perpetrated by the Spaniards in the\r\nNew World, which, however erroneously, they charged on the Holy Office.\r\n\"Do they expect,\" they cried, \"that we shall tamely wait here, like the\r\nwretched Indians, to be slaughtered by millions?\"[682] Men were seen\r\ngathering into knots, in the streets and public squares, discussing the\r\nconduct of the government, and gloomily talking of secret associations\r\nand foreign alliances. Meetings were stealthily held in the woods, and\r\nin the suburbs of the great towns, where the audience listened to\r\nfanatical preachers, who, while discussing the doctrines of religious\r\nreform, darkly hinted at resistance. Tracts were printed, and widely\r\ncirculated, in which the reciprocal obligations of lord and vassal were\r\ntreated, and the right of resistance was maintained; and, in some\r\ninstances, these difficult questions were handled with decided ability.\r\nA more common form was that of satire and scurrilous lampoon,--a\r\nfavorite weapon with the early Reformers. Their satirical sallies were\r\nlevelled indifferently at the throne and the Church. The bishops were an\r\nobvious mark. No one was spared. Comedies were written to ridicule the\r\nclergy. Never since the discovery of the art of printing--more than a\r\ncentury before--had the press been turned into an engine of such\r\npolitical importance as in the earlier stages of the revolution in the\r\nNetherlands. Thousands of the seditious pamphlets thus thrown off were\r\nrapidly circulated among a people, the humblest of whom possessed what\r\nmany a noble in other lands, at that day, was little skilled in,--the\r\nart of reading. Placards were nailed to the doors of the magistrates, in\r\nsome of the cities, proclaiming that Rome stood in need of her Brutus.\r\nOthers were attached to the gates of Orange and Egmont, calling on them\r\nto come forth and save their country.[683]\r\n\r\nMargaret was filled with alarm at these signs of disaffection throughout\r\nthe land. She felt the ground trembling beneath her. She wrote again and\r\nagain to Philip, giving full particulars of the state of the public\r\nsentiment, and the seditious spirit which seemed on the verge of\r\ninsurrection. She intimated her wish to resign the government.[684] She\r\nbesought him to allow the states-general to be summoned, and, at all\r\nevents, to come in person and take the reins from her hands, too weak to\r\nhold them.--Philip coolly replied, that \"he was sorry the despatches\r\nfrom Segovia had given such offence. They had been designed only for the\r\nservice of God and the good of the country.\"[685]\r\n\r\nIn this general fermentation, a new class of men came on the stage,\r\nimportant by their numbers, though they had taken no part as yet in\r\npolitical affairs. These were the lower nobility of the country; men of\r\nhonorable descent, and many of them allied by blood or marriage with the\r\nhighest nobles of the land. They were too often men of dilapidated\r\nfortunes, fallen into decay through their own prodigality, or that of\r\ntheir progenitors. Many had received their education abroad, some in\r\nGeneva, the home of Calvin, where they naturally imbibed the doctrines\r\nof the great Reformer. In needy circumstances, with no better possession\r\nthan the inheritance of honorable traditions, or the memory of better\r\ndays, they were urged by a craving, impatient spirit, which naturally\r\nmade them prefer any change to the existing order of things. They were,\r\nfor the most part, bred to arms; and, in the days of Charles the Fifth,\r\nhad found an ample career opened to their ambition under the imperial\r\nbanners. But Philip, with less policy than his father, had neglected to\r\ncourt this class of his subjects, who, without fixed principles or\r\nsettled motives of action, seemed to float on the surface of events,\r\nprepared to throw their weight, at any moment, into the scale of\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE COMPROMISE.]\r\n\r\nSome twenty of these cavaliers, for the most part young men, met\r\ntogether in the month of November, in Brussels, at the house of Count\r\nCulemborg, a nobleman attached to the Protestant opinions. Their avowed\r\npurpose was to listen to the teachings of a Flemish divine, named\r\nJunius, a man of parts and learning, who had been educated in the school\r\nof Calvin, and who, having returned to the Netherlands, exercised, under\r\nthe very eye of the regent, the dangerous calling of the missionary. At\r\nthis meeting of the discontented nobles, the talk naturally turned on\r\nthe evils of the land, and the best means of remedying them. The result\r\nof the conferences was the formation of a league, the principal objects\r\nof which are elaborately set forth in a paper known as the\r\n\"Compromise.\"[686]\r\n\r\nThis celebrated document declares that the king had been induced by evil\r\ncounsellors,--for the most part foreigners,--in violation of his oath,\r\nto establish the Inquisition in the country; a tribunal opposed to all\r\nlaw, divine and human, surpassing in barbarity anything ever yet\r\npractised by tyrants,[687] tending to bring the land to utter ruin, and\r\nthe inhabitants to a state of miserable bondage. The confederates,\r\ntherefore, in order not to become the prey of those who, under the name\r\nof religion, seek only to enrich themselves at the expense of life and\r\nproperty,[688] bind themselves by a solemn oath to resist the\r\nestablishment of the Inquisition, under whatever form it may be\r\nintroduced, and to protect each other against it with their lives and\r\nfortunes. In doing this, they protest that, so far from intending\r\nanything to the dishonor of the king, their only intent is to maintain\r\nthe king in his estate, and to preserve the tranquillity of the realm.\r\nThey conclude with solemnly invoking the blessing of the Almighty on\r\nthis their lawful and holy confederation.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the principal points urged in this remarkable\r\ninstrument, in which little mention is made of the edicts, every other\r\ngrievance being swallowed up in that of the detested Inquisition.\r\nIndeed, the translations of the \"Compromise,\" which soon appeared, in\r\nvarious languages, usually bore the title of \"League of the Nobles of\r\nFlanders against the Spanish Inquisition.\"[689]\r\n\r\nIt will hardly be denied that those who signed this instrument had\r\nalready made a decided move in the game of rebellion. They openly\r\narrayed themselves against the execution of the law and the authority of\r\nthe crown. They charged the king with having violated his oath, and they\r\naccused him of abetting a persecution which, under the pretext of\r\nreligion, had no other object than the spoil of its victims. It was of\r\nlittle moment that all this was done under professions of loyalty. Such\r\nprofessions are the decent cover with which the first approaches are\r\nalways made in a revolution.--The copies of the instrument differ\r\nsomewhat from each other. One of these, before me, as if to give the\r\nedge of personal insult to their remonstrance, classes in the same\r\ncategory \"the vagabond, the priest, and the _Spaniard_.\"[690]\r\n\r\nAmong the small company who first subscribed the document, we find names\r\nthat rose to eminence in the stormy scenes of the revolution. There was\r\nCount Louis of Nassau, a younger brother of the prince of Orange, the\r\n\"_bon chevalier_,\" as William used to call him,--a title well earned by\r\nhis generous spirit and many noble and humane qualities. Louis was bred\r\na Lutheran, and was zealously devoted to the cause of reform, when his\r\nbrother took but a comparatively languid interest in it. His ardent,\r\nprecipitate temper was often kept in check, and more wisely directed, by\r\nthe prudent counsels of William; while he amply repaid his brother by\r\nhis devoted attachment, and by the zeal and intrepidity with which he\r\ncarried out his plans. Louis, indeed, might be called the right hand of\r\nWilliam.\r\n\r\nAnother of the party was Philip de Marnix, lord of St. Aldegonde. He was\r\nthe intimate friend of William of Orange. In the words of a Belgian\r\nwriter, he was one of the beautiful characters of the time;[691]\r\ndistinguished alike as a soldier, a statesman, and a scholar. It is to\r\nhis pen that the composition of the \"Compromise\" has generally been\r\nassigned. Some critics have found its tone inconsistent with the sedate\r\nand tranquil character of his mind. Yet St. Aldegonde's device, \"_Repos\r\nailleurs_,\"[692] would seem to indicate a fervid imagination and an\r\nimpatient spirit of activity.\r\n\r\nBut the man who seems to have entered most heartily into these first\r\nmovements of the revolution was Henry, viscount of Brederode. He sprung\r\nfrom an ancient line, boasting his descent from the counts of Holland.\r\nThe only possession that remained to him, the lordship of Viana, he\r\nstill claimed to hold as independent of the king of Spain, or any other\r\npotentate. His patrimony had been wasted in a course of careless\r\nindulgence, and little else was left than barren titles and\r\npretensions,--which, it must be owned, he was not diffident in vaunting.\r\nHe was fond of convivial pleasures, and had a free, reckless humor, that\r\ntook with the people, to whom he was still more endeared by his sturdy\r\nhatred of oppression. Brederode was, in short, one of those busy,\r\nvaporing characters, who make themselves felt at the outset of a\r\nrevolution, but are soon lost in the course of it; like those ominous\r\nbirds which with their cries and screams herald in the tempest that soon\r\nsweeps them out of sight for ever.\r\n\r\nCopies of the \"Compromise,\" with the names attached to it, were soon\r\ndistributed through all parts of the country, and eagerly signed by\r\ngreat numbers, not merely of the petty nobility and gentry, but of\r\nsubstantial burghers and wealthy merchants, men who had large interests\r\nat stake in the community. Hames, king-at-arms of the Golden Fleece, who\r\nwas a zealous confederate, boasted that the names of two thousand such\r\npersons were on his paper.[693] Among them were many Roman Catholics;\r\nand we are again called to notice, that in the outset this Protestant\r\nrevolution received important support from the Catholics themselves, who\r\nforgot all religious differences in a common hatred of arbitrary power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ALARM OF THE COUNTRY.]\r\n\r\nFew, if any, of the great nobles seem to have been among the number of\r\nthose who signed the \"Compromise,\"--certainly none of the council of\r\nstate. It would hardly have done to invite one of the royal\r\ncouncillors--in other words, one of the government--to join the\r\nconfederacy, when they would have been bound by the obligations of their\r\noffice to disclose it to the regent.\r\n\r\nBut if the great lords did not become actual parties to the league, they\r\nshowed their sympathy with the object of it, by declining to enforce the\r\nexecution of the laws against which it was directed. On the\r\ntwenty-fourth of January, 1566, the prince of Orange addressed, from\r\nBreda, a letter to the regent, on the occasion of her sending him the\r\ndespatches from Segovia, for the rule of his government in the\r\nprovinces. In this remarkable letter, William exposes, with greater\r\nfreedom than he was wont, his reasons for refusing to comply with the\r\nroyal orders. \"I express myself freely and frankly,\" he says, \"on a\r\ntopic on which I have not been consulted; but I do so, lest by my\r\nsilence I may incur the responsibility of the mischief that must ensue.\"\r\nHe then briefly, and in a decided tone, touches on the evils of the\r\nInquisition,--introduced, as he says, contrary to the repeated pledges\r\nof the king,--and on the edicts. Great indulgence had been of late shown\r\nin the interpretation of these latter; and to revive them on a sudden,\r\nso as to execute them with their ancient rigor, would be most\r\ndisastrous. There could not be a worse time than the present, when the\r\npeople were sorely pressed by scarcity of food, and in a critical state\r\nfrom the religious agitations on their borders. It might cost the king\r\nhis empire in the Netherlands, and throw it into the hands of his\r\nneighbors.[694]\r\n\r\n\"For my own part,\" he concludes, \"if his majesty insists on the\r\nexecution of these measures, rather than incur the stain which must rest\r\non me and my house by attempting it, I will resign my office into the\r\nhands of some one better acquainted with the humors of the people, and\r\nwho will be better able to maintain order in the country.\"[695]\r\n\r\nIn the same tone several of the other provincial governors replied to\r\nMargaret, declaring that they could never coolly stand by and see fifty\r\nor sixty thousand of their countrymen burned to death for errors of\r\nreligion.[696] The regent was sorely perplexed by this desertion of the\r\nmen on whom she most relied. She wrote to them in a strain of\r\nexpostulation, and besought the prince, in particular, not to add to the\r\ntroubles of the time, by abandoning his post, where the attachment of\r\nthe people gave him such unbounded influence.[697]\r\n\r\nThe agitations of the country, in the mean time, continued to increase.\r\nThere was a scarcity of bread,--so often the forerunner of\r\nrevolution,--and this article had risen to an enormous price. The people\r\nwere menaced with famine, which might have led to serious consequences,\r\nbut for a temporary relief from Spain.[698]\r\n\r\nRumors now began to be widely circulated of the speedy coming of Philip,\r\nwith a large army, to chastise his vassals; and the rumors gained easy\r\ncredit with those who felt they were already within the pale of\r\nrebellion. Duke Eric of Brunswick was making numerous levies on the\r\nGerman borders, and it was generally believed that their destination was\r\nFlanders. It was in vain that Margaret, who ascertained the falsehood of\r\nthe report, endeavored to undeceive the people.[699]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PHILIP'S INFLEXIBILITY.]\r\n\r\nA short time previously, in the month of June, an interview had taken\r\nplace, at Bayonne, between the queen-mother, Catherine de Medicis, and\r\nher daughter, Isabella of Spain. Instead of her husband, Isabella was\r\naccompanied at this interview by the counsellor in whom he most trusted,\r\nthe duke of Alva. The two queens were each attended by a splendid\r\nretinue of nobles. The meeting was prolonged for several days, amidst a\r\nsuccession of balls, tourneys, and magnificent banquets, at which the\r\ncostly dress and equipage of the French nobility contrasted strangely\r\nenough with the no less ostentatious simplicity of the Spaniards. This\r\nsimplicity, so contrary to the usual pomp of the Castilian, was in\r\nobedience to the orders of Philip, who, foreseeing the national\r\nemulation, forbade the indulgence of it at a foolish cost, which in the\r\nend was severely felt by the shattered finances of France.\r\n\r\nAmid the brilliant pageants which occupied the public eye, secret\r\nconferences were daily carried on between Catherine and the duke of\r\nAlva. The results were never published, but enough found its way into\r\nthe light to show that the principal object was the extermination of\r\nheresy in France and the Netherlands. The queen-mother was for milder\r\nmeasures,--though slower not less sure. But the iron-hearted duke\r\ninsisted that to grant liberty of conscience was to grant unbounded\r\nlicence. The only way to exterminate the evil was by fire and sword! It\r\nwas on this occasion that, when Catherine suggested that it was easier\r\nto deal with the refractory commons than with the nobles, Alva replied,\r\n\"True, but ten thousand frogs are not worth the head of a single\r\nsalmon.\"[700]--an ominous simile, which was afterwards remembered\r\nagainst its author, when he ruled over the Netherlands.[701]\r\n\r\nThe report of these dark conferences had reached the Low Countries,\r\nwhere it was universally believed that the object of them was to secure\r\nthe coöperation of France in crushing the liberties of Flanders.[702]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ALARM OF THE COUNTRY.]\r\n\r\nIn the panic thus spread throughout the country, the more timid or\r\nprudent, especially of those who dwelt in the seaports, began to take\r\nmeasures for avoiding these evils by emigration. They sought refuge in\r\nProtestant states, and especially in England, where no less than thirty\r\nthousand, we are told by a contemporary, took shelter under the sceptre\r\nof Elizabeth.[703] They swarmed in the cities of London and Sandwich,\r\nand the politic queen assigned them also the seaport of Norwich as their\r\nresidence. Thus Flemish industry was transferred to English soil. The\r\ncourse of trade between the two nations now underwent a change. The silk\r\nand woollen stuffs, which had formerly been sent from Flanders to\r\nEngland, became the staple of a large export-trade from England to\r\nFlanders. \"The Low Countries,\" writes the correspondent of Granvelle,\r\n\"are the Indies of the English, who make war on our purses, as the\r\nFrench, some years since, made war on our towns.\"[704]\r\n\r\nSome of the Flemish provinces, instead of giving way to despondency,\r\nappealed sturdily to their charters, to rescue them from the arbitrary\r\nmeasures of the crown. The principal towns of Brabant, with Antwerp at\r\ntheir head, intrenched themselves behind their _Joyeuse Entrée_. The\r\nquestion was brought before the council; a decree was given in favor of\r\nthe applicants, and ratified by the regent; and the free soil of Brabant\r\nwas no longer polluted by the presence of the Inquisition.[705]\r\n\r\nThe gloom now became deeper round the throne of the regent. Of all in\r\nthe Netherlands, the person least to be envied was the one who ruled\r\nover them. Weaned from her attachment to Granvelle by the influence of\r\nthe lords, Margaret now found herself compelled to resume the arbitrary\r\npolicy which she disapproved, and to forfeit the support of the very\r\nparty to which of late she had given all her confidence. The lords in\r\nthe council withdrew from her, the magistrates in the provinces thwarted\r\nher, and large masses of the population were arrayed in actual\r\nresistance against the government. It may seem strange that it was not\r\ntill the spring of 1566 that she received positive tidings of the\r\nexistence of the league, when she was informed of it by Egmont, and some\r\nothers of the council of state.[706] As usual, the rumor went beyond the\r\ntruth. Twenty or thirty thousand men were said to be in arms, and half\r\nthat number to be prepared to march on Brussels, and seize the person of\r\nthe regent, unless she complied with their demands.[707]\r\n\r\nFor a moment Margaret thought of taking refuge in the citadel. But she\r\nsoon rallied, and showed the spirit to have been expected in the\r\ndaughter of Charles the Fifth. She ordered the garrisons to be\r\nstrengthened in the fortresses throughout the country. She summoned the\r\ncompanies of _ordonnance_ to the capital, and caused them to renew their\r\noaths of fidelity to the king. She wrote to the Spanish ministers at the\r\nneighboring courts, informed them of the league, and warned them to\r\nallow no aid to be sent to it from the countries where they resided.\r\nFinally, she called a meeting of the knights of the Golden Fleece and\r\nthe council of state, for the twenty-seventh of March, to deliberate on\r\nthe perilous situation of the country. Having completed these\r\narrangements, the duchess wrote to her brother, informing him exactly of\r\nthe condition of things, and suggesting what seemed to her counsellors\r\nthe most effectual remedy. She wrote the more freely, as her love of\r\npower had yielded to a sincere desire to extricate herself from the\r\ntrials and troubles which attended it.[708]\r\n\r\nThere were but two courses, she said, force or concession.[709] The\r\nformer, to say nothing of the ruin it would bring on the land, was\r\nrendered difficult by want of money to pay the troops, and by the want\r\nof trustworthy officers, to command them. Concessions must consist in\r\nabolishing the Inquisition,--a useless tribunal where sectaries swarmed\r\nopenly in the cities,--in modifying the edicts, and in granting a free\r\npardon to all who had signed the Compromise, provided they would return\r\nto their duty.[710] On these terms, the lords of the council were\r\nwilling to guaranty the obedience of the people. At all events, they\r\npromised Margaret their support in enforcing it. She would not express\r\nher own preference for either of the alternatives presented to Philip;\r\nbut would faithfully execute his commands, whatever they might be, to\r\nthe best of her ability.--Without directly expressing her preference, it\r\nwas pretty clear on which side it lay. Margaret concluded by earnestly\r\nbeseeching her brother to return an immediate answer to her despatches\r\nby the courier who bore them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ORANGE AND EGMONT.]\r\n\r\nThe person who seems to have enjoyed the largest share of Margaret's\r\nconfidence, at this time, was Egmont. He remained at Brussels, and still\r\nkept his seat in council after William had withdrawn to his estates in\r\nBreda. Yet the prince, although he had left Brussels in disgust, had not\r\ntaken part with the confederates; much less--as was falsely rumored, and\r\nto his great annoyance--put himself at their head.[711] His brother, it\r\nis true, and some of his particular friends, had joined the league. But\r\nLouis declares that he did so without the knowledge of William. When the\r\nlatter, a fortnight afterwards, learned the existence of the league, he\r\nexpressed his entire disapprobation of it.[712] He even used his\r\nauthority, we are told, to prevent the confederates from resorting to\r\nsome violent measures, among others the seizure of Antwerp, promising\r\nthat he would aid them to accomplish their ends in a more orderly\r\nway.[713] What he desired was, to have the states-general called\r\ntogether by the king. But he would not assume a hostile attitude, like\r\nthat of the confederates, to force him into this unpalatable\r\nmeasure.[714] When convened, he would have had the legislature, without\r\ntranscending its constitutional limits, remonstrate, and lay the\r\ngrievances of the nation before the throne.\r\n\r\nThis temperate mode of proceeding did not suit the hot blood of the\r\nyounger confederates. \"Your brother,\" writes Hames to Louis, \"is too\r\nslow and lukewarm. He would have us employ only remonstrance against\r\nthese hungry wolves; against enemies who do nothing in return but\r\nbehead, and banish, and burn us. We are to do the talking, and they the\r\nacting. We must fight with the pen, while they fight with the\r\nsword.\"[715]\r\n\r\nThe truth was, that William was not possessed of the fiery zeal which\r\nanimated most of the Reformers. In his early years, as we have seen, he\r\nhad been subjected to the influence of the Protestant religion at one\r\nperiod, and of the Roman Catholic at another. If the result of this had\r\nbeen to beget in him something like a philosophical indifference to the\r\ngreat questions in dispute, it had proved eminently favorable to a\r\nspirit of toleration. He shrunk from that system of persecution which\r\nproscribed men for their religious opinions. Soon after the arrival of\r\nthe despatches from Segovia, William wrote to a friend: \"The king\r\norders, not only obstinate heretics, but even the penitent, to be put to\r\ndeath. I know not how I can endure this. It does not seem to me that\r\nsuch measures are either Christian-like or practicable.\"[716] In another\r\nletter he says: \"I greatly fear these despatches will drive men into\r\nrebellion. I should be glad, if I could, to save my country from ruin,\r\nand so many innocent persons from slaughter. But when I say anything in\r\nthe council, I am sure to be misinterpreted. So I am greatly perplexed;\r\nsince speech and silence are equally bad.\"[717]\r\n\r\nActing with his habitual caution, therefore, he spoke little, and seldom\r\nexpressed his sentiments in writing. \"The less one puts in writing,\" he\r\nsaid to his less prudent brother, \"the better.\"[718] Yet when the\r\noccasion demanded it, he did not shrink from a plain avowal of his\r\nsentiments, both in speaking and writing. Such was the speech he\r\ndelivered in council before Egmont's journey to Spain; and in the same\r\nkey was the letter which he addressed to the regent on receiving the\r\ndespatches from Segovia. But, whatever might be his reserve, his real\r\nopinions were not misunderstood. He showed them too plainly by his\r\nactions. When Philip's final instructions were made known to him by\r\nMargaret, the prince, as he had before done under Granvelle, ceased to\r\nattend the meetings of the council, and withdrew from Brussels.[719] He\r\nmet in Breda, and afterwards in Hoogstraten, in the spring of 1566, a\r\nnumber of the principal nobles, under cover, as usual, of a banquet.\r\nDiscussions took place on the state of the country, and some of the\r\nconfederates who were present at the former place were for more violent\r\nmeasures than William approved. As he could not bring them over to his\r\nown temperate policy, he acquiesced in the draft of a petition, which,\r\nas we shall see in the ensuing chapter, was presented to the\r\nregent.[720] On the whole, up to the period at which we are arrived, the\r\nconduct of the prince of Orange must be allowed to have been wise and\r\nconsistent. In some respects it forms a contrast to that of his more\r\nbrilliant rival, Count Egmont.\r\n\r\nThis nobleman was sincerely devoted to the Roman Catholic faith. He was\r\nstanch in his loyalty to the king. At the same time he was ardently\r\nattached to his country, and felt a generous indignation at the wrongs\r\nshe suffered from her rulers. Thus Egmont was acted on by opposite\r\nfeelings; and, as he was a man of impulse, his conduct, as he yielded\r\nsometimes to the one and sometimes to the other of these influences,\r\nmight be charged with inconsistency. None charged him with insincerity.\r\n\r\nThere was that in Egmont's character which early led the penetrating\r\nGranvelle to point him out to Philip as a man who by politic treatment\r\nmight be secured to the royal cause.[721] Philip and his sister, the\r\nregent, both acted on this hint. They would hardly have attempted as\r\nmuch with William. Egmont's personal vanity made him more accessible to\r\ntheir approaches. It was this, perhaps, quite as much as any feeling of\r\nloyalty, which, notwithstanding the affront put on him, as he conceived,\r\nby the king, induced him to remain at Brussels, and supply the place in\r\nthe councils of the regent which William had left vacant. Yet we find\r\none of Granvelle's correspondents speaking of Egmont as too closely\r\nunited with the lords to be detached from them. \"To say truth,\" says the\r\nwriter, \"he even falters in his religion; and whatever he may say to-day\r\non this point, he will be sure to say the contrary to-morrow.\"[722] Such\r\na man, who could not be true to himself, could hardly become the leader\r\nof others.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DESIGN OF THE CONFEDERATES.]\r\n\r\n\"They put Egmont forward,\" writes the regent's secretary, \"as the\r\nboldest, to say what other men dare not say.\"[723] This was after the\r\ndespatches had been received. \"He complains bitterly,\" continues the\r\nwriter, \"of the king's insincerity. The prince has more _finesse_. He\r\nhas also more credit with the nation. If you could gain him, you will\r\nsecure all.\"[724] Yet Philip did not try to gain him. With all his\r\nwealth, he was not rich enough to do it. He knew this, and he hated\r\nWilliam with the hatred which a despotic monarch naturally bears to a\r\nvassal of such a temper. He perfectly understood the character of\r\nWilliam. The nation understood it too; and, with all their admiration\r\nfor the generous qualities of Egmont, it was to his greater rival that\r\nthey looked to guide them in the coming struggle of the revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE CONFEDERATES.\r\n\r\nDesign of the Confederates.--They enter Brussels.--The Petition.--The\r\nGueux.\r\n\r\n1566.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe party of the malecontents in the Netherlands comprehended persons of\r\nvery different opinions, who were by no means uniformly satisfied with\r\nthe reasonable objects proposed by the compromise. Some demanded entire\r\nliberty of conscience. Others would not have stopped short of a\r\nrevolution that would enable the country to shake off the Spanish yoke.\r\nAnd another class of men without principle of any kind--such as are too\r\noften thrown up in strong political fermentations--looked to these\r\nintestine troubles as offering the means of repairing their own fortunes\r\nout of the wreck of their country's. Yet, with the exception of the\r\nlast, there were few who would not have been content to accept the\r\ncompromise as the basis of their demands.\r\n\r\nThe winter had passed away, however, and the confederacy had wrought no\r\nchange in the conduct of the government. Indeed, the existence of the\r\nconfederacy would not appear to have been known to the regent till the\r\nlatter part of February, 1566. It was not till the close of the\r\nfollowing month that it was formally disclosed to her by some of the\r\ngreat lords.[725] If it was known to her before, Margaret must have\r\nthought it prudent to affect ignorance, till some overt action on the\r\npart of the league called for her notice.\r\n\r\nIt became, then, a question with the members of the league what was next\r\nto be done. It was finally resolved to present a petition, in the name\r\nof the whole body, to the regent, a measure which, as already intimated,\r\nreceived the assent, if not the approbation, of the prince of Orange.\r\nThe paper was prepared, as it would seem, in William's own house at\r\nBrussels, by his brother Louis; and was submitted, we are told, to the\r\nrevision of the prince, who thus had it in his power to mitigate, in\r\nmore than one instance the vehemence, or rather violence, of the\r\nexpressions.[726]\r\n\r\nTo give greater effect to the petition, it was determined that a large\r\ndeputation from the league should accompany its presentation to the\r\nregent. Notice was given to four hundred of the confederates to assemble\r\nat the beginning of April. They were to come well-mounted and armed,\r\nprepared at once to proceed to Brussels. Among the number thus enrolled,\r\nwe find three gentlemen of Margaret's own household, as well as some\r\nmembers of the companies of _ordonnance_ commanded by the prince, and by\r\nthe Counts Egmont, Hoorne, and other great lords.[727]\r\n\r\nThe duchess, informed of these proceedings, called a meeting of the\r\ncouncil of state and the knights of the Golden Fleece, to determine on\r\nthe course to be pursued. The discussion was animated, as there was much\r\ndifference of opinion. Some agreed with Count Barlaimont in regarding\r\nthe measure in the light of a menace. Such a military array could have\r\nno other object than to overawe the government, and was an insult to the\r\nregent. In the present excited state of the people, it would be attended\r\nwith the greatest danger to allow their entrance into the capital.[728]\r\n\r\nThe prince of Orange, who had yielded to Margaret's earnest entreaties\r\nthat he would attend this meeting, took a different view of the matter.\r\nThe number of the delegates, he said, only proved the interest taken in\r\nthe petition. They were men of rank, some of them kinsmen or personal\r\nfriends of those present. Their characters and position in the country\r\nwere sufficient sureties that they meditated no violence to the state.\r\nThey were the representatives of an ancient order of nobility; and it\r\nwould be strange indeed, if they were to be excluded from the right of\r\npetition, enjoyed by the humblest individual.--In the course of the\r\ndebate, William made some personal allusions to his own situation,\r\ndelivering himself with great warmth. His enemies, he said, had the\r\nroyal ear, and would persuade the king to kill him and confiscate his\r\nproperty.[729] He was even looked upon as the head of the confederacy.\r\nIt was of no use for him to give his opinion in the council, where it\r\nwas sure to be misinterpreted. All that remained for him was to ask\r\nleave to resign his offices, and withdraw to his estates.[730] Count\r\nHoorne followed in much the same key, inveighing bitterly against the\r\ningratitude of Philip. The two nobles yielded, at length, so far to\r\nMargaret's remonstrances, as to give their opinions on the course to be\r\npursued. But when she endeavored to recall them to their duty by\r\nreminding them of their oaths to the king, they boldly replied, they\r\nwould willingly lay down their lives for their country, but would never\r\ndraw sword for the edicts or the Inquisition.[731]--William's views in\r\nregard to the admission of the confederates into Brussels were supported\r\nby much the greater part of the assembly, and finally prevailed with the\r\nregent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE CONFEDERATES ENTER BRUSSELS.]\r\n\r\nOn the third of April, 1566, two hundred of the confederates entered the\r\ngates of Brussels. They were on horseback, and each man was furnished\r\nwith a brace of pistols in his holsters, wearing in other respects only\r\nthe usual arms of a private gentleman. The Viscount Brederode and Louis\r\nof Nassau rode at their head.[732] They prudently conformed to William's\r\nadvice, not to bring any foreigners in their train, and to enter the\r\ncity quietly, without attempting to stir the populace by any military\r\ndisplay, or the report of fire-arms.[733] Their coming was welcomed with\r\ngeneral joy by the inhabitants, who greeted them as a band of patriots\r\nready to do battle for the liberties of the country. They easily found\r\nquarters in the houses of the principal citizens; and Louis and\r\nBrederode were lodged in the mansion of the prince of Orange.[734]\r\n\r\nOn the following day a meeting of the confederates was held at the hotel\r\nof Count Culemborg, where they listened to a letter which Brederode had\r\njust received from Spain, informing him of the death of Morone, a\r\nFlemish nobleman well known to them all, who had perished in the flames\r\nof the Inquisition.[735] With feelings exasperated by this gloomy\r\nrecital, they renewed, in the most solemn manner, their oaths of\r\nfidelity to the league. An application was then made to Margaret for\r\nleave to lay their petition before her. The day following was assigned\r\nfor the act; and at noon, on the fifth of April, the whole company\r\nwalked in solemn procession through the streets of Brussels to the\r\npalace of the regent. She received them, surrounded by the lords, in the\r\ngreat hall adjoining the council-chamber. As they defiled before her,\r\nthe confederates ranged themselves along the sides of the apartment.\r\nMargaret seems to have been somewhat disconcerted by the presence of so\r\nmartial an array within the walls of her palace. But she soon recovered\r\nherself, and received them graciously.[736]\r\n\r\nBrederode was selected to present the petition, and he prefaced it by a\r\nshort address. They had come in such numbers, he said, the better to\r\nshow their respect to the regent, and the deep interest they took in the\r\ncause. They had been accused of opening a correspondence with foreign\r\nprinces, which he affirmed to be a malicious slander, and boldly\r\ndemanded to be confronted with the authors of it.[737]--Notwithstanding\r\nthis stout denial, it is very possible the audience did not place\r\nimplicit confidence in the assertions of the speaker. He then presented\r\nthe petition to the regent, expressing the hope that she would approve\r\nof it, as dictated only by their desire to promote the glory of the king\r\nand the good of the country. If this was its object, Margaret replied,\r\nshe doubted not she should be content with it.[738] The following day\r\nwas named for them again to wait on her, and receive her answer.\r\n\r\nThe instrument began with a general statement of the distresses of the\r\nland, much like that in the Compromise, but couched in more respectful\r\nlanguage. The petitioners had hoped that the action of the great lords,\r\nor of the states-general, would have led to some reform. But finding\r\nthese had not moved in the matter, while the evil went on increasing\r\nfrom day to day, until ruin was at the gate, they had come to beseech\r\nher highness to lay the subject herself before the king, and implore his\r\nmajesty to save the country from perdition by the instant abolition of\r\nboth the Inquisition and the edicts. Far from wishing to dictate laws to\r\ntheir sovereign, they humbly besought her to urge on him the necessity\r\nof convoking the states-general, and devising with them some effectual\r\nremedy for the existing evils. Meanwhile they begged of her to suspend\r\nthe further execution of the laws in regard to religion until his\r\nmajesty's pleasure could be known. If their prayer were not granted,\r\nthey at least were absolved from all responsibility as to the\r\nconsequences, now that they had done their duty as true and loyal\r\nsubjects.[739]--The business-like character of this document forms a\r\ncontrast to the declamatory style of the Compromise; and in its\r\ntemperate tone, particularly, we may fancy we recognize the touches of\r\nthe more prudent hand of the prince of Orange.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth, the confederates again assembled in the palace of the\r\nregent, to receive her answer. They were in greater force than before,\r\nhaving been joined by a hundred and fifty of their brethren, who had\r\nentered the city the night previous, under the command of Counts\r\nCulemborg and Berg. They were received by Margaret in the same courteous\r\nmanner as on the preceding day, and her answer was made to them in\r\nwriting, being endorsed on their own petition.\r\n\r\nShe announced in it her purpose of using all her influence with her\r\nroyal brother to persuade him to accede to their wishes. They might rely\r\non his doing all that was conformable to his _natural and accustomed\r\nbenignity_.[740] She had herself, with the advice of her council and the\r\nknights of the Golden Fleece, prepared a scheme for moderating the\r\nedicts, to be laid before his majesty, which she trusted would satisfy\r\nthe nation. They must however, be aware, that she herself had no power\r\nto suspend the execution of the laws. But she would send instructions to\r\nthe inquisitors to proceed with all discretion in the exercise of their\r\nfunctions, until they should learn the king's pleasure.[741] She trusted\r\nthat the confederates would so demean themselves as not to make it\r\nnecessary to give different orders. All this she had done with the\r\ngreater readiness, from her conviction that they had no design to make\r\nany innovation in the established religion of the country, but desired\r\nrather to uphold it in all its vigor.\r\n\r\nTo this reply, as gracious in its expressions, and as favorable in its\r\nimport, as the league could possibly have expected, they made a formal\r\nanswer in writing, which they presented in a body to the duchess, on the\r\neighth of the month. They humbly thanked her for the prompt attention\r\nshe had given to their petition, but would have been still more\r\ncontented if her answer had been more full and explicit. They knew the\r\nembarrassments under which she labored, and they thanked her for the\r\nassurance she had given,--which, it may be remarked, she never did\r\ngive,--that all proceedings connected with the Inquisition and the\r\nedicts should be stayed until his majesty's pleasure should be\r\nascertained. They were most anxious to conform to whatever the king,\r\n_with the advice and consent of the states-general_, duly assembled,\r\nshould determine in matters of religion,[742] and they would show their\r\nobedience by taking such order for their own conduct as should give\r\nentire satisfaction to her highness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARGARET'S REPLY]\r\n\r\nTo this the duchess briefly replied, that, if there were any cause for\r\noffence hereafter, it would be chargeable, not on her, but on them. She\r\nprayed the confederates henceforth to desist from their secret\r\npractices, and to invite no new member to join their body.[743]\r\n\r\nThis brief and admonitory reply seems not to have been to the taste of\r\nthe petitioners, who would willingly have drawn from Margaret some\r\nexpression that might be construed into a sanction of their proceedings.\r\nAfter a short deliberation among themselves, they again addressed her by\r\nthe mouth of one of their own number, the lord of Kerdes. The speaker,\r\nafter again humbly thanking the regent for her favorable answer, said\r\nthat it would have given still greater satisfaction to his associates,\r\nif she would but have declared, in the presence of the great lords\r\nassembled, that she took the union of the confederates in good part and\r\nfor the service of the king;[744] and he concluded with promising that\r\nthey would henceforth do all in their power to give contentment to her\r\nhighness.\r\n\r\nTo all this the duchess simply replied, she had no doubt of it. When\r\nagain pressed by the persevering deputy to express her opinion of this\r\nassembly, she bluntly answered, she could form no judgment in the\r\nmatter.[745]--She gave pretty clear evidence, however, of her real\r\nopinion, soon after, by dismissing the three gentlemen of her household\r\nwhom we have mentioned as having joined the league.[746]\r\n\r\nAs Margaret found that the confederates were not altogether satisfied\r\nwith her response to their petition, she allowed Count Hoogstraten, one\r\nof her councillors, to inform some of them, privately, that she had\r\nalready written to the provinces to have all processes in affairs of\r\nreligion stayed until Philip's decision should be known. To leave no\r\nroom for distrust, the count was allowed to show them copies of the\r\nletters.[747]\r\n\r\nThe week spent by the league in Brussels was a season of general\r\njubilee. At one of the banquets given at Culemborg House, where three\r\nhundred confederates were present, Brederode presided. During the repast\r\nhe related to some of the company, who had arrived on the day after the\r\npetition was delivered, the manner in which it had been received by the\r\nduchess. She seemed at first disconcerted, he said, by the number of the\r\nconfederates, but was reassured by Barlaimont, who told her \"they were\r\nnothing but a crowd of beggars.\"[748] This greatly incensed some of the\r\ncompany,--with whom, probably, it was too true for a jest. But\r\nBrederode, taking it more good-humoredly, said that he and his friends\r\nhad no objection to the name, since they were ready at any time to\r\nbecome beggars for the service of their king and country.[749] This\r\nsally was received with great applause by the guests, who, as they drank\r\nto one another, shouted forth, \"_Vivent les Gueux!_\"--\"Long live the\r\nbeggars!\"\r\n\r\nBrederode, finding the jest took so well,--an event, indeed, for which\r\nhe seems to have been prepared,--left the room, and soon returned with a\r\nbeggar's wallet, and a wooden bowl, such as was used by the mendicant\r\nfraternity in the Netherlands. Then, pledging the company in a bumper,\r\nhe swore to devote his life and fortune to the cause. The wallet and the\r\nbowl went round the table; and, as each of the merry guests drank in\r\nturn to his confederates, the shout arose of \"_Vivent les Gueux!\"_ until\r\nthe hall rang with the mirth of the revellers.[750]\r\n\r\nIt happened that at the time the prince of Orange and the Counts Egmont\r\nand Hoorne were passing by on their way to the council. Their attention\r\nwas attracted by the noise, and they paused a moment, when William, who\r\nknew well the temper of the jovial company, proposed that they should go\r\nin, and endeavor to break up their revels. \"We may have some business of\r\nthe council to transact with these men this evening,\" he said, \"and at\r\nthis rate they will hardly be in a condition for it.\" The appearance of\r\nthe three nobles gave a fresh impulse to the boisterous merriment of the\r\ncompany; and as the new-comers pledged their friends in the wine-cup, it\r\nwas received with the same thundering acclamations of \"_Vivent les\r\nGueux!_\"[751] This incident, of so little importance in itself, was\r\nafterwards made of consequence by the turn that was given to it in the\r\nprosecution of the two unfortunate noblemen who accompanied the prince\r\nof Orange.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows the importance of a popular name to a faction,--a _nom\r\nde guerre_, under which its members may rally and make head together as\r\nan independent party. Such the name of \"_Gueux_\" now became to the\r\nconfederates. It soon was understood to signify those who were opposed\r\nto the government, and, in a wiser sense, to the Roman Catholic\r\nreligion. In every language in which the history of these acts has been\r\nrecorded,--the Latin, German, Spanish, or English,--the French term\r\n_Gueux_ is ever employed to designate this party of malecontents in the\r\nNetherlands.[752]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE GUEUX.]\r\n\r\nIt now became common to follow out the original idea by imitations of\r\nthe different articles used by mendicants. Staffs were procured, after\r\nthe fashion of those in the hands of the pilgrims, but more elaborately\r\ncarved. Wooden bowls, spoons, and knives became in great request, though\r\nrichly inlaid with silver, according to the fancy or wealth of the\r\npossessor. Medals resembling those stuck by the beggars in their bonnets\r\nwere worn as a badge; and the \"Gueux penny,\" as it was called,--a gold\r\nor silver coin,--was hung from the neck, bearing on one side the effigy\r\nof Philip, with the inscription, \"_Fidèles au roi_;\" and on the other,\r\ntwo hands grasping a beggar's wallet, with the further legend, \"_jusques\r\nà porter la besace_;\"--\"Faithful to the king, even to carrying the\r\nwallet.\"[753] Even the garments of the mendicant were affected by the\r\nconfederates, who used them as a substitute for their family liveries;\r\nand troops of their retainers, clad in the ash-gray habiliments of the\r\nbegging friars, might be seen in the streets of Brussels and the other\r\ncities of the Netherlands.[754]\r\n\r\nOn the tenth of April, the confederates quitted Brussels, in the orderly\r\nmanner in which they had entered it; except that, on issuing from the\r\ngate, they announced their departure by firing a salute in honor of the\r\ncity which had given them so hospitable a welcome.[755] Their visit to\r\nBrussels had not only created a great sensation in the capital itself,\r\nbut throughout the country. Hitherto the league had worked in darkness,\r\nas it were, like a band of secret conspirators. But they had now come\r\nforward into the light of day, boldly presenting themselves before the\r\nregent, and demanding redress of the wrongs under which the nation was\r\ngroaning. The people took heart, as they saw this broad ægis extended\r\nover them to ward off the assaults of arbitrary power. Their hopes grew\r\nstronger, as they became assured of the interposition of the regent and\r\nthe great lords in their favor; and they could hardly doubt that the\r\nvoice of the country, backed as it was by that of the government, would\r\nmake itself heard at Madrid, and that Philip would at length be\r\ncompelled to abandon a policy which menaced him with the loss of the\r\nfairest of his provinces.--They had yet to learn the character of their\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nFREEDOM OF WORSHIP.\r\n\r\nThe Edicts suspended.--The Sectaries.--The Public Preachings.--Attempt\r\nto suppress them.--Meeting at St. Trond.--Philip's Concessions.\r\n\r\n1566.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn quitting Brussels, the confederates left there four of their number\r\nas a sort of committee to watch over the interests of the league. The\r\ngreater part of the remainder, with Brederode at their head, took the\r\nroad to Antwerp. They were hardly established in their quarters in that\r\ncity, when the building was surrounded by thousands of the inhabitants,\r\neager to give their visitors a tumultuous welcome. Brederode came out on\r\nthe balcony, and, addressing the crowd, told them that he had come\r\nthere, at the hazard of his life, to rescue them from the miseries of\r\nthe Inquisition. He called on his audience to take him as their leader\r\nin this glorious work; and as the doughty champion pledged them in a\r\ngoblet of wine which he had brought with him from the table, the mob\r\nanswered by such a general shout as was heard in the furthest corners of\r\nthe city.[756] Thus a relation was openly established between the\r\nconfederates and the people, who were to move forward together in the\r\ngreat march of the revolution.\r\n\r\nSoon after the departure of the confederates from Brussels, the regent\r\ndespatched an embassy to Madrid to acquaint the king with the recent\r\nproceedings, and to urge his acquiescence in the reforms solicited by\r\nthe league. The envoys chosen were the baron de Montigny--who had taken\r\ncharge, it may be remembered, of a similar mission before--and the\r\nmarquis of Bergen, a nobleman of liberal principles, but who stood high\r\nin the regard of the regent.[757] Neither of the parties showed any\r\nalacrity to undertake a commission which was to bring them so closely in\r\ncontact with the dread monarch in his capital. Bergen found an apology\r\nfor some time in a wound from a tennis-ball, which disabled his leg; an\r\nominous accident, interpreted by the chroniclers of the time into an\r\nintimation from Heaven of the disastrous issue of the mission.[758]\r\nMontigny reached Madrid some time before his companion, on the\r\nseventeenth of June, and met with a gracious reception from Philip, who\r\nlistened with a benignant air to the recital of the measures suggested\r\nfor the relief of the country, terminating, as usual, with an\r\napplication for a summons of the states-general, as the most effectual\r\nremedy for the disorders. But although the envoy was admitted to more\r\nthan one audience, he obtained no more comfortable assurance, than that\r\nthe subject should receive the most serious consideration of his\r\nmajesty.[759]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE EDICTS SUSPENDED.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the regent was busy in digesting the plan of compromise to\r\nwhich she had alluded in her reply to the confederates. When concluded,\r\nit was sent to the governors of the several provinces, to be laid before\r\ntheir respective legislatures. Their sanction, it was hoped, would\r\nrecommend its adoption to the people at large. It was first submitted to\r\nsome of the smaller states, as Artois, Namur, and Luxemburg, as most\r\nlikely to prove subservient to the wishes of the government. It was then\r\nlaid before several of the larger states, as Brabant and Flanders, whose\r\ndetermination might be influenced by the example of the others. Holland,\r\nZealand, Utrecht, and one or two other provinces, where the spirit of\r\nindependence was highest, were not consulted at all. Yet this politic\r\nmanagement did not entirely succeed; and although some few gave an\r\nunconditional assent, most of the provinces coupled their acquiescence\r\nwith limitations that rendered it of little worth.[760]\r\n\r\nThis was not extraordinary. The scheme was one which, however large the\r\nconcessions it involved on the part of the government, fell far short of\r\nthose demanded by the people. It denounced the penalty of death on all\r\nministers and teachers of the reformed religion, and all who harbored\r\nthem; and while it greatly mitigated the punishment of other offenders,\r\nits few sanguinary features led the people sneeringly to call it,\r\ninstead of \"moderation,\" the act of \"_murderation_.\"[761] It fared,\r\nindeed, with this compromise of the regent, as with most other half-way\r\nmeasures. It satisfied neither of the parties concerned in it. The king\r\nthought it as much too lenient as the people thought it too severe. It\r\nnever received the royal sanction, and of course never became a law. It\r\nwould therefore hardly have deserved the time I have bestowed on it,\r\nexcept as evidence of the conciliatory spirit of the regent's\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit Margaret was careful to urge the royal officers to\r\ngive a liberal interpretation to the existing edicts, and to show the\r\nutmost discretion in their execution. These functionaries were not slow\r\nin obeying commands, which released them from so much of the odium that\r\nattached to their ungrateful office. The amiable temper of the\r\ngovernment received support from a singular fraud which took place at\r\nthis time. An instrument was prepared, purporting to have come from the\r\nknights of the Golden Fleece, in which this body guarantied to the\r\nconfederates that no one in the Low Countries should be molested on\r\naccount of his religion until otherwise determined by the king and the\r\nstates-general. This document, which carried its spurious origin on its\r\nface, was nevertheless eagerly caught up and circulated among the\r\npeople, ready to believe what they most desired. In vain the regent, as\r\nsoon as she heard of it, endeavored to expose the fraud. It was too\r\nlate; and the influence of this imposture combined with the tolerant\r\nmeasures of the government to inspire a confidence in the community\r\nwhich was soon visible in its results. Some who had gone into exile\r\nreturned to their country. Many, who had cherished the new doctrines in\r\nsecret, openly avowed them; while others who were wavering, now that\r\nthey were relieved from all fear of consequences, became fixed in their\r\nopinions. In short, the Reformation, in some form or other, was making\r\nrapid advances over the country.[762]\r\n\r\nOf the three great sects who embraced it, the Lutherans, the least\r\nnumerous, were the most eminent for their rank. The Anabaptists, far\r\nexceeding them in number, were drawn almost wholly from the humbler\r\nclasses of the people. It is singular that this sect, the most quiet and\r\ninoffensive of all, should have been uniformly dealt with by the law\r\nwith peculiar rigor. It may, perhaps, be attributed to the bad name\r\nwhich attached to them from the excesses committed by their brethren,\r\nthe famous Anabaptists of Münster. The third denomination, the\r\nCalvinists, far out-numbered both of the other two. They were also the\r\nmost active in the spirit of proselytism. They were stimulated by\r\nmissionaries trained in the schools of Geneva; and as their doctrines\r\nspread silently over the land, not only men of piety and learning, but\r\npersons of the highest social position, were occasionally drawn within\r\nthe folds of the sect.\r\n\r\nThe head-quarters of the Calvinists were in Flanders, Hainault, Artois,\r\nand the provinces contiguous to France. The border land became the\r\nresidence of French Huguenots, and of banished Flemings, who on this\r\noutpost diligently labored in the cause of the Reformation. The press\r\nteemed with publications,--vindications of the faith, polemical tracts,\r\ntreatises, and satires against the Church of Rome and its errors,--those\r\nspiritual missiles, in short, which form the usual magazine for\r\ncontroversial warfare. These were distributed by means of peddlers and\r\ntravelling tinkers, who carried them, in their distant wanderings, to\r\nthe humblest firesides throughout the country. There they were left to\r\ndo their work; and the ground was thus prepared for the laborers whose\r\nadvent forms an epoch in the history of the Reformation.[763]\r\n\r\nThese were the ministers or missionaries, whose public preaching soon\r\ncaused a great sensation throughout the land. They first made their\r\nappearance in Western Flanders, before small audiences gathered together\r\nstealthily in the gloom of the forest and in the silence of night. They\r\ngradually emerged into the open plains, thence proceeding to the\r\nvillages, until, growing bolder with impunity, they showed themselves in\r\nthe suburbs of the great towns and cities. On these occasions, thousands\r\nof the inhabitants, men, women, and children, in too great force for the\r\nmagistrates to resist them, poured out of the gates to hear the\r\npreacher. In the centre of the ground a rude staging was erected, with\r\nan awning to protect him from the weather. Immediately round the rude\r\npulpit was gathered the more helpless part of the congregation, the\r\nwomen and children. Behind them stood the men,--those in the outer\r\ncircle usually furnished with arms,--swords, pikes, muskets,--any weapon\r\nthey could pick up for the occasion. A patrol of horse occupied the\r\nground beyond, to protect the assembly and prevent interruption. A\r\nbarricade of wagons and other vehicles was thrown across the avenues\r\nthat led to the place, to defend it against the assaults of the\r\nmagistrates or the military. Persons stationed along the high roads\r\ndistributed religious tracts, and invited the passengers to take part in\r\nthe services.[764]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PUBLIC PREACHINGS.]\r\n\r\nThe preacher was frequently some converted priest or friar, accustomed\r\nto speak in public, who, having passed the greater part of his life in\r\nbattling for the Church, now showed equal zeal in overturning it. It\r\nmight be, however, that the orator was a layman; some peasant or\r\nartisan, who, gifted with more wit, or possibly more effrontery, than\r\nhis neighbors, felt himself called on to assume the perilous vocation of\r\na preacher. The discourse was in French or Flemish, whichever might be\r\nthe language spoken in the neighborhood. It was generally of the homely\r\ntexture suited both to the speaker and his audience. Yet sometimes he\r\ndescanted on the woes of the land with a pathos which drew tears from\r\nevery eye; and at others gave vent to a torrent of fiery eloquence, that\r\nkindled the spirit of the ancient martyr in the bosoms of his hearers.\r\n\r\nThese lofty flights were too often degraded by coarse and scurrilous\r\ninvectives against the pope, the clergy, and the Inquisition,--themes,\r\npeculiarly grateful to his audience, who testified their applause by as\r\nnoisy demonstrations as if they had been spectators in a theatre. The\r\nservice was followed by singing some portion of the Psalms in the French\r\nversion of Marot, or in a Dutch translation which had recently appeared\r\nin Holland,[765] and which, although sufficiently rude, passed with the\r\nsimple people for a wonderful composition. After this, it was common for\r\nthose who attended to present their infants for baptism; and many\r\ncouples profited by the occasion to have the marriage ceremony performed\r\nwith the Calvinistic rites. The exercises were concluded by a collection\r\nfor the poor of their own denomination. In fine, these meetings,\r\nnotwithstanding the occasional licence of the preacher, seem to have\r\nbeen conducted with a seriousness and decorum which hardly merit the\r\nobloquy thrown on them by some of the Catholic writers.\r\n\r\nThe congregation, it is true, was made up of rather motley materials.\r\nSome went out merely to learn what manner of doctrine it was that was\r\ntaught; others, to hear the singing, where thousands of voices blended\r\ntogether in rude harmony under the canopy of heaven; others, again, with\r\nno better motive than amusement, to laugh at the oddity--perhaps the\r\nbuffoonery--of the preacher. But far the larger portion of the audience\r\nwent with the purpose of joining in the religious exercises, and\r\nworshipping God in their own way.[766] We may imagine what an influence\r\nmust have been exercised by these meetings, where so many were gathered\r\ntogether, under a sense of common danger, to listen to the words of the\r\nteacher, who taught them to hold all human law as light in comparison\r\nwith the higher law of conscience seated in their own bosoms. Even of\r\nthose who came to scoff, few there were, probably, who did not go away\r\nwith some food for meditation, or, it may be, the seeds of future\r\nconversion implanted in their breasts.\r\n\r\nThe first of these public preachings--which began as early as May--took\r\nplace in the neighborhood of Ghent. Between six and seven thousand\r\npersons were assembled. A magistrate of the city, with more valor than\r\ndiscretion, mounted his horse, and, armed with sword and pistol, rode in\r\namong the multitude, and undertook to arrest the minister. But the\r\npeople hastened to his rescue, and dealt so roughly with the unfortunate\r\nofficer, that he barely escaped with life from their hands.[767]\r\n\r\nFrom Ghent the preachings extended to Ypres, Bruges, and other great\r\ntowns of Flanders,--always in the suburbs,--to Valenciennes, and to\r\nTournay, in the province of Hainault, where the Reformers were strong\r\nenough to demand a place of worship within the walls. Holland was ready\r\nfor the Word. Ministers of the _new religion_, as it was called, were\r\nsent both to that quarter and to Zealand. Gatherings of great multitudes\r\nwere held in the environs of Amsterdam, the Hague, Haarlem, and other\r\nlarge towns, at which the magistrates were sometimes to be found mingled\r\nwith the rest of the burghers.\r\n\r\nBut the place where these meetings were conducted on the greatest scale\r\nwas Antwerp, a city containing then more than a hundred thousand\r\ninhabitants, and the most important mart for commerce in the\r\nNetherlands. It was the great resort of foreigners. Many of these were\r\nHuguenots, who, under the pretext of trade, were much more busy with the\r\nconcerns of their religion. At the meetings without the walls, it was\r\nnot uncommon for thirteen or fourteen thousand persons to assemble.[768]\r\nResistance on the part of the magistrates was ineffectual. The mob got\r\npossession of the keys of the city; and, as most of the Calvinists were\r\narmed, they constituted a formidable force. Conscious of their strength,\r\nthey openly escorted their ministers back to town, and loudly demanded\r\nthat some place of worship should be appropriated to them within the\r\nwalls of Antwerp. The quiet burghers became alarmed. As it was known\r\nthat in the camp of the Reformers were many reckless and disorderly\r\npersons, they feared the town might be given over to pillage. All trade\r\nceased. Many of the merchants secreted their effects, and some prepared\r\nto make their escape as speedily as possible.[769]\r\n\r\nThe magistrates, in great confusion, applied to the regent, and besought\r\nher to transfer her residence to Antwerp, where her presence might\r\noverawe the spirit of sedition. But Margaret's council objected to her\r\nplacing herself in the hands of so factious a population; and she\r\nanswered the magistrates by inquiring what guaranty they could give her\r\nfor her personal safety. They then requested that the prince of Orange,\r\nwho held the office of _burgrave_ of Antwerp, and whose influence with\r\nthe people was unbounded, might be sent to them. Margaret hesitated as\r\nto this; for she had now learned to regard William with distrust, as\r\nassuming more and more an unfriendly attitude towards her brother.[770]\r\nBut she had no alternative, and she requested him to transfer his\r\nresidence to the disorderly capital, and endeavor to restore it to\r\ntranquillity. The prince, on the other hand, disgusted with the course\r\nof public affairs, had long wished to withdraw from any share in their\r\nmanagement. It was with reluctance he accepted the commission.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ATTEMPT TO SUPPRESS PREACHINGS.]\r\n\r\nAs he drew near to Antwerp the people flocked out by thousands to\r\nwelcome him. It would seem as if they hailed him as their deliverer; and\r\nevery window, verandah, and roof was crowded with spectators as he rode\r\nthrough the gates of the capital.[771] The people ran up and down the\r\nstreets, singing psalms, or shouting, \"_Vivent les Gueux!_\" while they\r\nthronged round the prince's horse in so dense a mass that it was\r\nscarcely possible for him to force a passage.[772] Yet these\r\ndemonstrations of his popularity were not altogether satisfactory; and\r\nhe felt no pleasure at being thus welcomed as a chief of the league,\r\nwhich, as we have seen, he was far from regarding with approbation.\r\nWaving his hand repeatedly to those around him, he called on them to\r\ndisperse, impatiently exclaiming, \"Take heed what you do, or, by Heaven,\r\nyou will have reason to rue it.\"[773] He rode straight to the hall where\r\nthe magistrates were sitting, and took counsel with them as to the best\r\nmeans of allaying the popular excitement, and of preventing the wealthy\r\nburghers from quitting the city. During the few weeks he remained there,\r\nthe prince conducted affairs so discreetly, as to bring about a better\r\nunderstanding between the authorities and the citizens. He even\r\nprevailed on the Calvinists to lay aside their arms. He found more\r\ndifficulty in persuading them to relinquish the design of appropriating\r\nto themselves some place of worship within the walls. It was not till\r\nWilliam called in the aid of the military to support him, that he\r\ncompelled them to yield.[774]\r\n\r\nThus the spirit of reform was rapidly advancing in every part of the\r\ncountry,--even in presence of the court, under the very eye of the\r\nregent. In Brussels the people went through the streets by night,\r\nsinging psalms, and shouting the war-cry of _Vivent les Gueux!_ The\r\nmerchants and wealthy burghers were to be seen with the insignia of the\r\nconfederates on their dress.[775] Preparations were made for a public\r\npreaching without the walls; but the duchess at once declared, that in\r\nthat event she would make one of the company at the head of her guard,\r\nseize the preacher, and hang him up at the gates of the city![776] This\r\nmenace had the desired effect.\r\n\r\nDuring these troublous times, Margaret, however little she may have\r\naccomplished, could not be accused of sleeping on her post. She caused\r\nfasts to be observed, and prayers to be offered in all the churches, to\r\navert the wrath of Heaven from the land. She did not confine herself to\r\nthese spiritual weapons, but called on the magistrates of the towns to\r\ndo their duty, and on all good citizens to support them. She commanded\r\nforeigners to leave Antwerp, except those only who were there for\r\ntraffic. She caused placards to be everywhere posted up, reciting the\r\nterrible penalties of the law against heretical teachers and those who\r\nabetted them; and she offered a reward of six hundred florins to whoever\r\nshould bring any such offender to punishment.[777] She strengthened the\r\ngarrisoned towns, and would have levied a force to overawe the\r\nrefractory; but she had not the funds to pay for it. She endeavored to\r\nprovide these by means of loans from the great clergy and the principal\r\ntowns; but with indifferent success. Most of them were already creditors\r\nof the government, and they liked the security too little to make\r\nfurther advances. In her extremity, Margaret had no resource but the one\r\nso often tried,--that of invoking the aid of her brother. \"I have no\r\nrefuge,\" she wrote, \"but in God and your majesty. It is with anguish\r\nand dismay I must admit that my efforts have wholly failed to prevent\r\nthe public preaching, which has spread over every quarter of the\r\ncountry.\"[778] She bitterly complains, in another letter, that, after\r\n\"so many pressing applications, she should be thus left, without aid and\r\nwithout instructions, to grope her way at random.\"[779] She again\r\nbeseeches Philip to make the concessions demanded, in which event the\r\ngreat lords assure her of their support in restoring order.\r\n\r\nIt was the policy of the cabinet of Madrid not to commit itself. The\r\nroyal answers were brief, vague, never indicating a new measure,\r\ngenerally intimating satisfaction with the conduct of the regent, and\r\nthrowing as far as possible all responsibility on her shoulders.\r\n\r\nBut besides his sister's letters, the king was careful to provide\r\nhimself with other sources of information respecting the state of the\r\nNetherlands. From some of these the accounts he received of the conduct\r\nof the great lords were even less favorable than hers. A letter from the\r\nsecretary, Armenteros, speaks of the difficulty he finds in fathoming\r\nthe designs of the prince of Orange,--a circumstance which he attributes\r\nto his probable change of religion. \"He relies much,\" says the writer,\r\n\"on the support he receives in Germany, on his numerous friends at home,\r\nand on the general distrust entertained of the king. The prince is\r\nmaking preparations in good season,\" he concludes, \"for defending\r\nhimself against your majesty.\"[780]\r\n\r\nYet Philip did not betray any consciousness of this unfriendly temper in\r\nthe nobles. To the prince of Orange, in particular, he wrote: \"You err\r\nin imagining that I have not entire confidence in you. Should any one\r\nseek to do you an ill office with me, I should not be so light as to\r\ngive ear to him, having had so large experience of your loyalty and your\r\nservices.\"[781] \"This is not the time,\" he adds, \"for men like you to\r\nwithdraw from public affairs.\" But William was the last man to be duped\r\nby these fair words. When others inveighed against the conduct of the\r\nregent, William excused her by throwing the blame on Philip. \"Resolved\r\nto deceive all,\" he said, \"he begins by deceiving his sister.\"[782]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MEETING AT ST. TROND.]\r\n\r\nIt was about the middle of July that an event occurred which caused\r\nstill greater confusion in the affairs of the Netherlands. This was a\r\nmeeting of the confederates at St. Trond, in the neighborhood of Liege.\r\nThey assembled, two thousand in number, with Count Louis and Brederode\r\nat their head. Their great object was to devise some means for their\r\npersonal security. They were aware that they were held responsible, to\r\nsome extent, for the late religious movements among the people.[783]\r\nThey were discontented with the prolonged silence of the king, and they\r\nwere alarmed by rumors of military preparations, said to be designed\r\nagainst them. The discussions of the assembly, long and animated, showed\r\nsome difference of opinion. All agreed to demand some guaranty from the\r\ngovernment for their security. But the greater part of the body, no\r\nlonger halting at the original limits of their petition, were now for\r\ndemanding absolute toleration in matters of religion. Some few of the\r\nnumber, stanch Catholics at heart, who for the first time seem to have\r\nhad their eyes opened to the results to which they were inevitably\r\ntending, now, greatly disgusted, withdrew from the league. Among these\r\nwas the younger Count Mansfeldt,--a name destined to become famous in\r\nthe annals of the revolution.\r\n\r\nMargaret, much alarmed by these new demonstrations, sent Orange and\r\nEgmont to confer with the confederates, and demand why they were thus\r\nmet in an unfriendly attitude towards the government which they had so\r\nlately pledged themselves to support in maintaining order. The\r\nconfederates replied by sending a deputation of their body to submit\r\ntheir grievances anew to the regent.\r\n\r\nThe deputies, twelve in number, and profanely nicknamed at Brussels \"the\r\ntwelve apostles,\"[784] presented themselves, with Count Louis at their\r\nhead, on the twenty-eighth of July, at the capital. Margaret, who with\r\ndifficulty consented to receive them in person, gave unequivocal signs\r\nof her displeasure. In the plain language of Louis, \"the regent was\r\nready to burst with anger.\"[785] The memorial, or rather remonstrance,\r\npresented to her was not calculated to allay it.\r\n\r\nWithout going into details, it is only necessary to say, that the\r\nconfederates, after stating their grounds for apprehension, requested\r\nthat an assurance should be given by the government that no harm was\r\nintended them. As to pardon for the past, they disclaimed all desire for\r\nit. What they had done called for applause, not condemnation. They only\r\ntrusted that his majesty would be pleased to grant a convocation of the\r\nstates-general, to settle the affairs of the country. In the mean time,\r\nthey besought him to allow the concerns of the confederates to be placed\r\nin the hands of the prince of Orange, and the Counts Egmont and Hoorne,\r\nto act as their mediators with the crown, promising in all things to be\r\nguided by their counsel. Thus would tranquillity be restored. But\r\nwithout some guaranty for their safety, they should be obliged to\r\nprotect themselves by foreign aid.[786]\r\n\r\nThe haughty tone of this memorial forms a striking contrast with that of\r\nthe petition presented by the same body not four months before, and\r\nshows with what rapid strides the revolution had advanced. The religious\r\nagitations had revealed the amount of discontent in the country, and to\r\nwhat extent, therefore, the confederates might rely on the sympathy of\r\nthe people. This was most unequivocally proved during the meeting of St.\r\nTrond, where memorials were presented by the merchants, and by persons\r\nof the Reformed religion, praying the protection of the league to secure\r\nthem freedom of worship, till otherwise determined by the\r\nstates-general. This extraordinary request was granted.[787] Thus the\r\ntwo great parties leaned on each other for support, and gave mutual\r\nconfidence to their respective movements. The confederates, discarding\r\nthe idea of grace, which they had once solicited, now darkly intimated a\r\npossible appeal to arms. The Reformers, on their side, instead of the\r\nmitigation of penalties, now talked of nothing less than absolute\r\ntoleration. Thus political Revolution and religious Reform went hand in\r\nhand together. The nobles and the commons, the two most opposite\r\nelements of the body politic, were united closely by a common interest;\r\nand a formidable opposition was organized to the designs of the monarch,\r\nwhich might have made any monarch tremble on his throne.\r\n\r\nAn important fact shows that the confederates coolly looked forward,\r\neven at this time, to a conflict with Spain. Louis of Nassau had a large\r\ncorrespondence with the leaders of the Huguenots in France, and of the\r\nLutherans in Germany. By the former he had been offered substantial aid\r\nin the way of troops. But the national jealousy entertained of the\r\nFrench would have made it impolitic to accept it. He turned therefore to\r\nGermany, where he had numerous connections, and where he subsidized a\r\nforce consisting of four thousand horse and forty companies of foot, to\r\nbe at the disposal of the league. This negotiation was conducted under\r\nthe eye, and, as it seems, partly through the agency, of his brother\r\nWilliam.[788] From this moment, therefore, if not before, the prince of\r\nOrange may be identified with the party who were prepared to maintain\r\ntheir rights by an appeal to arms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MEETING AT ST. TROND.]\r\n\r\nThese movements of the league could not be kept so close but that they\r\ncame to the knowledge of Margaret. Indeed, she had her secret agents at\r\nSt. Trond, who put her in possession of whatever was done, or even\r\ndesigned, by the confederates.[789] This was fully exhibited in her\r\ncorrespondence with Philip, while she again called his attention to the\r\nforlorn condition of the government, without men, or money, or the means\r\nto raise it.[790] \"The sectaries go armed,\" she writes, \"and are\r\norganizing their forces. The league is with them. There remains nothing\r\nbut that they should band together, and sack the towns, villages, and\r\nchurches, of which I am in marvellous great fear.\"[791]--Her fears had\r\ngifted her with the spirit of prophecy. She implores her brother, if he\r\nwill not come himself to Flanders, to convoke the states-general,\r\nquoting the words of Egmont, that, unless summoned by the king they\r\nwould assemble of themselves, to devise some remedy for the miseries of\r\nthe land, and prevent its otherwise inevitable ruin.[792] At length came\r\nback the royal answer to Margaret's reiterated appeals. It had at least\r\none merit, that of being perfectly explicit.\r\n\r\nMontigny, on reaching Madrid, as we have seen, had ready access to\r\nPhilip. Both he and his companion, the marquis of Bergen, were allowed\r\nto witness, it would seem, the deliberations of the council of state,\r\nwhen the subject of their mission was discussed. Among the members of\r\nthat body, at this time, may be noticed the duke of Alva; Ruy Gomez de\r\nSilva, prince of Eboli, who divided with Alva the royal favor; Figueroa,\r\ncount of Feria, a man of an acute and penetrating intellect, formerly\r\nambassador to England, in Queen Mary's time; and Luis de Quixada, the\r\nmajor-domo of Charles the fifth. Besides these there were two or three\r\ncouncillors from the Netherlands, among whose names we meet with that of\r\nHopper, the near friend and associate of Viglius. There was great\r\nunanimity in the opinions of this loyal body, where none, it will be\r\nreadily believed, was disposed to lift his voice in favour of reform.\r\nThe course of events in the Netherlands, they agreed, plainly showed a\r\ndeliberate and well-concerted scheme of the great nobles to secure to\r\nthemselves the whole power of the country. The first step was the\r\nremoval of Granvelle, a formidable obstacle in their path. Then came the\r\nattempt to concentrate the management of affairs in the hands of the\r\ncouncil of state. This was followed by assaults on the Inquisition and\r\nthe edicts, as the things most obnoxious to the people; by the cry in\r\nfavor of the states-general; by the league, the Compromise, the\r\npetitions, the religious assemblies; and, finally, by the present\r\nmission to Spain. All was devised by the great nobles, as part of a\r\nregular system of hostility to the crown, the real object of which was\r\nto overturn existing institutions, and to build up their own authority\r\non the ruins. While the council regarded these proceedings with the\r\ndeepest indignation, they admitted the necessity of bending to the\r\nstorm, and under present circumstances judged it prudent for the monarch\r\nto make certain specified concessions to the people of the Netherlands.\r\nAbove all, they earnestly besought Philip, if he would still remain\r\nmaster of this portion of his empire, to defer no longer his visit to\r\nthe country.[793]\r\n\r\nThe discussions occupied many and long-protracted sittings of the\r\ncouncil; and Philip deeply pondered, in his own closet, on the results,\r\nafter the discussions were concluded. Even those most familiar with his\r\nhabits were amazed at the long delay of his decision in the present\r\ncritical circumstances.[794] The haughty mind of the monarch found it\r\ndifficult to bend to the required concessions. At length his answer\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nThe letter containing it was addressed to his sister, and was dated on\r\nthe thirty-first of July, 1566, at the Wood of Segovia,--the same place\r\nfrom which he had dictated his memorable despatches the year preceding.\r\nPhilip began, as usual, with expressing his surprise at the continued\r\ntroubles of the country. He was not aware that any rigorous procedure\r\ncould be charged on the tribunals, or that any change had been made in\r\nthe laws since the days of Charles the Fifth. Still, as it was much more\r\nagreeable to his nature to proceed with clemency and love than with\r\nseverity,[795] he would conform as far as possible to the desires of his\r\nvassals.\r\n\r\nHe was content that the Inquisition should be abolished in the\r\nNetherlands, and in its place be substituted the inquisitorial powers\r\nvested in the bishops. As to the edicts, he was not pleased with the\r\nplan of Moderation devised by Margaret; nor did he believe that any plan\r\nwould satisfy the people short of perfect toleration. Still, he would\r\nhave his sister prepare another scheme, having due reference to the\r\nmaintenance of the Catholic faith and his own authority. This must be\r\nsubmitted to him, and he would do all that he possibly could in the\r\nmatter.[796] Lastly, in respect to a general pardon, as he abhorred\r\nrigor where any other course would answer the end,[797] he was content\r\nthat it should be extended to whomever Margaret thought deserving of\r\nit,--always excepting those already condemned, and under a solemn\r\npledge, moreover, that the nobles would abandon the league, and\r\nhenceforth give their hearty support to the government.\r\n\r\nFour days after the date of these despatches, on the second of August,\r\nPhilip again wrote to his sister, touching the summoning of the\r\nstates-general, which she had so much pressed. He had given the subject,\r\nhe said, a most patient consideration, and was satisfied that she had\r\ndone right in refusing to call them together. She must not consent to\r\nit. He never would consent to it.[798] He knew too well to what it must\r\ninevitably lead. Yet he would not have her report his decision in the\r\nabsolute and peremptory terms in which he had given it to her, but as\r\nintended merely for the present occasion; so that the people might\r\nbelieve she was still looking for something of a different tenor, and\r\ncherish the hope of obtaining their object at some future day![799]\r\n\r\nThe king also wrote, that he should remit a sufficient sum to Margaret\r\nto enable her to take into her pay a body of ten thousand German foot\r\nand three thousand horse, on which she could rely in case of extremity.\r\nHe further wrote letters with his own hand to the governors of the\r\nprovinces and the principal cities, calling on them to support the\r\nregent in her efforts to enforce the laws and maintain order throughout\r\nthe country.[800]\r\n\r\nSuch were the concessions granted by Philip, at the eleventh hour, to\r\nhis subjects of the Netherlands!--concessions wrung from him by hard\r\nnecessity; doled out, as it were, like the scanty charity of the\r\nmiser,--too scanty and too late to serve the object for which it is\r\nintended. But slight as these concessions were, and crippled by\r\nconditions which rendered them nearly nugatory, it will hardly be\r\nbelieved that he was not even sincere in making them! This is proved by\r\na revelation lately made of a curious document in the Archives of\r\nSimancas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PHILIP'S CONCESSIONS.]\r\n\r\nWhile the ink was scarcely dry on the despatches to Margaret, Philip\r\nsummoned a notary into his presence, and before the duke of Alva and\r\ntwo other persons, jurists, solemnly protested that the authority he had\r\ngiven to the regent in respect to a general pardon was not of his own\r\nfree will. \"He therefore did not feel bound by it, but reserved to\r\nhimself the right to punish the guilty, and especially the authors and\r\nabettors of sedition in the Low Countries.\"[801] We feel ourselves at\r\nonce transported into the depths of the Middle Ages. This feeling will\r\nnot be changed when we learn the rest of the story of this admirable\r\npiece of kingcraft.\r\n\r\nThe chair of St. Peter, at this time, was occupied by Pius the Fifth, a\r\npope who had assumed the same name as his predecessor, and who displayed\r\na spirit of fierce, indeed frantic intolerance, surpassing even that of\r\nPaul the Fourth. At the accession of the new pope there were three\r\nItalian scholars, inhabitants of Milan, Venice, and Tuscany, eminent for\r\ntheir piety, who had done great service to the cause of letters in\r\nItaly, but who were suspected of too liberal opinions in matters of\r\nfaith. Pius the Fifth demanded that these scholars should all be\r\ndelivered into his hands. The three states had the meanness to comply.\r\nThe unfortunate men were delivered up to the Holy Office, condemned, and\r\nburned at the stake. This was one of the first acts of the new\r\npontificate. It proclaimed to Christendom that Pius the Fifth was the\r\nuncompromising foe of heresy, the pope of the Inquisition. Every\r\nsubsequent act of his reign served to confirm his claim to this\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nYet, as far as the interests of Catholicism were concerned, a character\r\nlike that of Pius the Fifth must be allowed to have suited the times.\r\nDuring the latter part of the fifteenth century and the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth, the throne had been filled by a succession of pontiffs\r\nnotorious for their religious indifference, and their carelessness, too\r\noften profligacy, of life. This, as is well known, was one of the\r\nprominent causes of the Reformation. A reaction followed. It was\r\nnecessary to save the Church. A race of men succeeded, of ascetic\r\ntemper, remarkable for their austere virtues, but without a touch of\r\nsympathy for the joys or sorrows of their species, and wholly devoted to\r\nthe great work of regenerating the fallen Church. As the influence of\r\nthe former popes had opened a career to the Reformation, the influence\r\nof these latter popes tended materially to check it; and long before the\r\nclose of the sixteenth century the boundary line was defined, which it\r\nhas never since been allowed to pass.\r\n\r\nPius, as may be imagined, beheld with deep anxiety the spread of the new\r\nreligion in the Low Countries. He wrote to the duchess of Parma,\r\nexhorting her to resist to the utmost, and professing his readiness to\r\nsupply her, if need were, with both men and money. To Philip he also\r\nwrote, conjuring him not to falter in the good cause, and to allow no\r\nharm to the Catholic faith, but to march against his rebellious vassals\r\nat the head of his army, and wash out the stain of heresy in the blood\r\nof the heretic.[802]\r\n\r\nThe king now felt it incumbent on him to explain to the holy father his\r\nlate proceedings. This he did through Requesens, his ambassador at the\r\npapal court. The minister was to inform his holiness that Philip would\r\nnot have moved in this matter without his advice, had there been time\r\nfor it. But perhaps it was better as it was; for the abolition of the\r\nInquisition in the Low Countries could not take effect, after all,\r\nunless sanctioned by the pope, by whose authority it had been\r\nestablished. This, however, was _to be said in confidence_.[803] As to\r\nthe edicts, Pius might be assured that his majesty would never approve\r\nof any scheme which favored the guilty by diminishing in any degree the\r\npenalties of their crimes. This also _was to be considered as\r\nsecret_.[804] Lastly, his holiness need not be scandalized by the grant\r\nof a general pardon, since it referred only to what concerned the king\r\npersonally, where he had a right to grant it. In fine, the pope might\r\nrest assured that the king would consent to nothing that could prejudice\r\nthe service of God or the interests of religion. He deprecated force, as\r\nthat would involve the ruin of the country. Still, he would march in\r\nperson, without regard to his own peril, and employ force, though it\r\nshould cost the ruin of the provinces, but he would bring his vassals to\r\nsubmission. For he would sooner lose a hundred lives, and every rood of\r\nempire, than reign a lord over heretics.[805]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CATHEDRAL OF ANTWERP SACKED.]\r\n\r\nThus all the concessions of Philip, not merely his promises of grace,\r\nbut those of abolishing the Inquisition and mitigating the edicts, were\r\nto go for nothing,--mere words, to amuse the people until some effectual\r\nmeans could be decided on. The king must be allowed, for once at least,\r\nto have spoken with candor. There are few persons who would not have\r\nshrunk from acknowledging to their own hearts that they were acting on\r\nso deliberate a system of perfidy as Philip thus confided in his\r\ncorrespondence with another. Indeed, he seems to have regarded the pope\r\nin the light of his confessor, to whom he was to unburden his bosom as\r\nfrankly as if he had been in the confessional. The shrift was not likely\r\nto bring down a heavy penance from one who doubtless held to the\r\northodox maxim of \"No faith to be kept with heretics.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of these royal concessions was what might have been expected.\r\nCrippled as they were by conditions, they were regarded in the Low\r\nCountries with distrust, not to say contempt. In fact, the point at\r\nwhich Philip had so slowly and painfully arrived had been long since\r\npassed in the onward march of the revolution. The men of the Netherlands\r\nnow talked much more of recompense than of pardon. By a curious\r\ncoincidence, the thirty-first of July, the day on which the king wrote\r\nhis last despatches from Segovia, was precisely the date of those which\r\nMargaret sent to him from Brussels, giving the particulars of the recent\r\ntroubles, of the meeting at St. Trond, the demand for a guaranty, and\r\nfor an immediate summons of the legislature.\r\n\r\nBut the fountain of royal grace had been completely drained by the late\r\nefforts. Philip's reply at this time was prompt and to the point. As to\r\nthe guaranty, he said, that was superfluous when he had granted a\r\ngeneral pardon. For the states-general, there was no need to alter his\r\ndecision now, since he was so soon to be present in the country.[806]\r\n\r\nThis visit of the king to the Low Countries, respecting which so much\r\nwas said and so little was done, seems to have furnished some amusement\r\nto the wits of the court. The prince of Asturias, Don Carlos, scribbled\r\none day on the cover of a blank book, as its title, \"The Great and\r\nAdmirable Voyages of King Philip;\" and within, for the contents, he\r\nwrote, \"From Madrid to the Pardo, from the Pardo to the Escorial, from\r\nthe Escorial to Aranjuez,\" &c., &c.[807] This jest of the graceless son\r\nhad an edge to it. We are not told how far it was relished by his royal\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE ICONOCLASTS.\r\n\r\nCathedral of Antwerp sacked.--Sacrilegious Outrages.--Alarm at\r\nBrussels.--Churches granted to Reformers.--Margaret repents her\r\nConcessions.--Feeling at Madrid.--Sagacity of Orange.--His Religious\r\nOpinions.\r\n\r\n1566.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Philip was thus tardily coming to concessions which even then were\r\nnot sincere, an important crisis had arrived in the affairs of the\r\nNetherlands. In the earlier stages of the troubles, all orders, the\r\nnobles, the commons, even the regent, had united in the desire to\r\nobtain the removal of certain abuses, especially the Inquisition and the\r\nedicts. But this movement, in which the Catholic joined with the\r\nProtestant, had far less reference to the interests of religion than to\r\nthe personal rights of the individual. Under the protection thus\r\nafforded, however, the Reformation struck deep root in the soil. It\r\nnourished still more under the favor shown to it by the confederates,\r\nwho, as we have seen, did not scruple to guaranty security of religions\r\nworship to some of the sectaries who demanded it.\r\n\r\nBut the element which contributed most to the success of the new\r\nreligion was the public preachings. These in the Netherlands were what\r\nthe Jacobin clubs were in France, or the secret societies in Germany and\r\nItaly,--an obvious means for bringing together such as were pledged to a\r\ncommon hostility to existing institutions, and thus affording them an\r\nopportunity for consulting on their grievances, and for concerting the\r\nbest means of redress. The direct object of these meetings, it is true,\r\nwas to listen to the teachings of the minister. But that functionary,\r\nfar from confining himself to spiritual exercises, usually wandered to\r\nmore exciting themes, as the corruptions of the Church and the condition\r\nof the land. He rarely failed to descant on the forlorn circumstances of\r\nhimself and his flock, condemned thus stealthily to herd together like a\r\nband of outlaws, with ropes, as it were, about their necks, and to seek\r\nout some solitary spot in which to glorify the Lord, while their\r\nenemies, in all the pride of a dominant religion, could offer up their\r\ndevotions openly and without fear, in magnificent temples. The preacher\r\ninveighed bitterly against the richly benefited clergy of the rival\r\nChurch, whose lives of pampered ease too often furnished an indifferent\r\ncommentary on the doctrines they inculcated. His wrath was kindled by\r\nthe pompous ceremonial of the Church of Rome, so dazzling and attractive\r\nto its votaries, but which the Reformer sourly contrasted with the naked\r\nsimplicity of the Protestant service. Of all abominations, however, the\r\ngreatest in his eyes was the worship of images, which he compared to the\r\nidolatry that in ancient times had so often brought down the vengeance\r\nof Jehovah on the nations of Palestine; and he called on his hearers,\r\nnot merely to remove idolatry from their hearts, but the idols from\r\ntheir sight.[808] It was not wonderful that, thus stimulated by their\r\nspiritual leaders, the people should be prepared for scenes similar to\r\nthose enacted by the Reformers in France and in Scotland; or that\r\nMargaret, aware of the popular feeling, should have predicted such an\r\noutbreak. At length it came, and on a scale and with a degree of\r\nviolence not surpassed either by the Huguenots or the disciples of Knox.\r\n\r\nOn the fourteenth of August, the day before the festival of the\r\nAssumption of the Virgin, a mob, some three hundred in number, armed\r\nwith clubs, axes, and other implements of destruction, broke into the\r\nchurches around St. Omer, in the province of Flanders, overturned the\r\nimages, defaced the ornaments, and in a short time demolished whatever\r\nhad any value or beauty in the buildings. Growing bolder from the\r\nimpunity which attended their movements, they next proceeded to Ypres,\r\nand had the audacity to break into the cathedral, and deal with it in\r\nthe same ruthless manner. Strengthened by the accession of other\r\nmiscreants from the various towns, they proceeded along the banks of the\r\nLys, and fell upon the churches of Menin, Comines, and other places on\r\nits borders. The excitement now spread over the country. Everywhere the\r\npopulace was in arms. Churches, chapels, and convents were involved in\r\nindiscriminate ruin. The storm, after sweeping over Flanders, and\r\ndesolating the flourishing cities of Valenciennes and Tournay,\r\ndescended on Brabant. Antwerp, the great commercial capital of the\r\ncountry, was its first mark.[809]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CATHEDRAL OF ANTWERP SACKED.]\r\n\r\nThe usual population of the town happened to be swelled at this time by\r\nan influx of strangers from the neighboring country, who had come up to\r\ncelebrate the great festival of the Assumption of the Virgin.\r\nFortunately the prince of Orange was in the place, and by his presence\r\nprevented any molestation to the procession, except what arose from the\r\noccasional groans and hisses of the more zealous spectators among the\r\nProtestants. The priests, however, on their return, had the discretion\r\nto deposit the image in the chapel, instead of the conspicuous station\r\nusually assigned to it in the cathedral, to receive there during the\r\ncoming week the adoration of the faithful.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, unluckily, the prince was recalled to Brussels. In\r\nthe evening some boys, who had found their way into the church, called\r\nout to the Virgin, demanding \"why little Mary had gone so early to her\r\nnest, and whether she were afraid to show her face in public.\"[810] This\r\nwas followed by one of the party mounting into the pulpit, and there\r\nmimicking the tones and gestures of the Catholic preacher. An honest\r\nwaterman who was present, a zealous son of the Church, scandalized by\r\nthis insult to his religion, sprang into the pulpit, and endeavored to\r\ndislodge the usurper. The lad resisted. His comrades came to his rescue;\r\nand a struggle ensued, which ended in both the parties being expelled\r\nfrom the building by the officers.[811] This scandalous proceeding, it\r\nmay be thought, should have put the magistrates of the city on their\r\nguard, and warned them to take some measures of defence for the\r\ncathedral. But the admonition was not heeded.\r\n\r\nOn the following day a considerable number of the reformed party entered\r\nthe building, and were allowed to continue there after vespers, when the\r\nrest of the congregation had withdrawn. Left in possession, their first\r\nact was to break forth into one of the Psalms of David. The sound of\r\ntheir own voices seemed to rouse them to fury. Before the chant had died\r\naway, they rushed forward as by a common impulse, broke open the doors\r\nof the chapel, and dragged forth the image of the Virgin. Some called on\r\nher to cry, \"_Vivent les Gueux!_\" while others tore off her embroidered\r\nrobes, and rolled the dumb idol in the dust, amidst the shouts of the\r\nspectators.\r\n\r\nThis was the signal for havoc. The rioters dispersed in all directions\r\non the work of destruction. Nothing escaped their rage. High above the\r\ngreat altar was an image of the Saviour, curiously carved in wood, and\r\nplaced between the effigies of the two thieves crucified with him. The\r\nmob contrived to get a rope round the neck of the statue of Christ, and\r\ndragged it to the ground. They then fell upon it with hatchets and\r\nhammers, and it was soon broken into a hundred fragments. The two\r\nthieves, it was remarked, were spared, as if to preside over the work of\r\nrapine below.\r\n\r\nTheir fury now turned against the other statues, which were quickly\r\noverthrown from their pedestals. The paintings that lined the walls of\r\nthe cathedral were cut into shreds. Many of these were the choicest\r\nspecimens of Flemish art, even then, in its dawn, giving promise of the\r\nglorious day which was to shed a lustre over the land.\r\n\r\nBut the pride of the cathedral, and of Antwerp, was the great organ,\r\nrenowned throughout the Netherlands, not more for its dimensions than\r\nits perfect workmanship. With their ladders the rioters scaled the lofty\r\nfabric, and with their implements soon converted it, like all else they\r\nlaid their hands on, into a heap of rubbish.\r\n\r\nThe ruin was now universal. Nothing beautiful, nothing holy, was spared.\r\nThe altars--and there were no less than seventy in the vast\r\nedifice--were overthrown one after another; their richly embroidered\r\ncoverings rudely rent away; their gold and silver vessels appropriated\r\nby the plunderers. The sacramental bread was trodden under foot; the\r\nwine was quaffed by the miscreants, in golden chalices, to the health of\r\none another, or of the Gueux; and the holy oil was profanely used to\r\nanoint their shoes and sandals. The sculptured tracery on the walls, the\r\ncostly offerings that enriched the shrines, the screens of gilded\r\nbronze, the delicately carved wood-work of the pulpit, the marble and\r\nalabaster ornaments, all went down under the fierce blows of the\r\niconoclasts. The pavement was strewed with the ruined splendors of a\r\nchurch, which in size and magnificence was perhaps second only to St.\r\nPeter's among the churches of Christendom.\r\n\r\nAs the light of day faded, the assailants supplied its place with such\r\nlight as they could obtain from the candles which they snatched from the\r\naltars. It was midnight before the work of destruction was completed.\r\nThus toiling in darkness, feebly dispelled by tapers the rays of which\r\ncould scarcely penetrate the vaulted distances of the cathedral, it is a\r\ncurious circumstance--if true--than no one was injured by the heavy\r\nmasses of timber, stone, and metal that were everywhere falling around\r\nthem.[812] The whole number engaged in this work is said not to have\r\nexceeded a hundred men, women, and boys,--women of the lowest\r\ndescription, dressed in men's attire.\r\n\r\nWhen their task was completed, they sallied forth in a body from the\r\ndoors of the cathedral, some singing the Psalms of David, others roaring\r\nout the fanatical war-cry of \"_Vivent les Gueux!_\" Flushed with success,\r\nand joined on the way by stragglers like themselves, they burst open the\r\ndoors of one church after another; and by the time morning broke, the\r\nprincipal temples in the city had been dealt with in the same ruthless\r\nmanner as the cathedral.[813]\r\n\r\nNo attempt all this time was made to stop these proceedings on the part\r\nof magistrates or citizens. As they beheld from their windows the bodies\r\nof armed men hurrying to and fro by the gleam of their torches, and\r\nlistened to the sounds of violence in the distance, they seem to have\r\nbeen struck with a panic. The Catholics remained within doors, fearing a\r\ngeneral rising of the Protestants. The Protestants feared to move\r\nabroad, lest they should be confounded with the rioters. Some imagined\r\ntheir own turn might come next, and appeared in arms at the entrances of\r\ntheir houses, prepared to defend them against the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SACRILEGIOUS OUTRAGES.]\r\n\r\nWhen gorged with the plunder of the city, the insurgents poured out at\r\nthe gates, and fell with the same violence on the churches, convents,\r\nand other religious edifices in the suburbs. For three days these dismal\r\nscenes continued, without resistance on the part of the inhabitants.\r\nAmidst the ruin in the cathedral, the mob had alone spared the royal\r\narms and the escutcheons of the knights of the Golden Fleece, emblazoned\r\non the walls. Calling this to mind, they now returned into the city to\r\ncomplete the work. But some of the knights, who were at Antwerp,\r\ncollected a handful of their followers, and, with a few of the citizens,\r\nforced their way into the cathedral, arrested ten or twelve of the\r\nrioters, and easily dispersed the remainder; while a gallows erected on\r\nan eminence admonished the offenders of the fate that awaited them. The\r\nfacility with which the disorders were repressed by a few resolute men\r\nnaturally suggests the inference, that many of the citizens had too much\r\nsympathy with the authors of the outrages to care to check them, still\r\nless to bring the culprits to punishment. An orthodox chronicler of the\r\ntime vents his indignation against a people who were so much more ready\r\nto stand by their hearths than by their altars.[814]\r\n\r\nThe fate of Antwerp had its effect on the country. The flames of\r\nfanaticism, burning fiercer than ever, quickly spread over the northern,\r\nas they had done over the western provinces. In Holland, Utrecht,\r\nFriesland,--everywhere, in short, with a few exceptions on the southern\r\nborders,--mobs rose against the churches. In some places, as Rotterdam,\r\nDort, Haarlem, the magistrates were wary enough to avert the storm by\r\ndelivering up the images, or at least by removing them from the\r\nbuildings.[815] It was rare that any attempt was made at resistance. Yet\r\non one or two occasions this so far succeeded that a handful of troops\r\nsufficed to rout the iconoclasts. At Anchyn, four hundred of the rabble\r\nwere left dead on the field. But the soldiers had no relish for their\r\nduty, and on other occasions, when called on to perform it, refused to\r\nbear arms against their countrymen.[816] The leaven of heresy was too\r\nwidely spread among the people.\r\n\r\nThus the work of plunder and devastation went on vigorously throughout\r\nthe land. Cathedral and chapel, monastery and nunnery, religious houses\r\nof every description, even hospitals, were delivered up to the tender\r\nmercies of the Reformers. The monks fled, leaving behind them treasures\r\nof manuscripts and well-stored cellars, which latter the invaders soon\r\nemptied of their contents, while they consigned the former to the\r\nflames. The terrified nuns, escaping half naked, at dead of night, from\r\ntheir convents, were too happy to find a retreat among their friends and\r\nkinsmen in the city.[817] Neither monk nor nun ventured to go abroad in\r\nthe conventual garb. Priests might be sometimes seen hurrying away with\r\nsome relic or sacred treasure under their robes, which they were eager\r\nto save from the spoilers. In the general sack not even the abode of the\r\ndead was respected; and the sepulchres of the counts of Flanders were\r\nviolated, and laid open to the public gaze![818]\r\n\r\nThe deeds of violence perpetrated by the iconoclasts were accompanied by\r\nsuch indignities as might express their contempt for the ancient faith.\r\nThey snatched the wafer, says an eye-witness, from the altar, and put it\r\ninto the mouth of a parrot. Some huddled the images of the saints\r\ntogether, and set them on fire, or covered them with bits of armor, and,\r\nshouting \"_Vivent les Gueux!_\" tilted rudely against them. Some put on\r\nthe vestments stolen from the churches, and ran about the streets with\r\nthem in mockery. Some basted the books with butter, that they might burn\r\nthe more briskly.[819] By the scholar, this last enormity will not be\r\nheld light among their transgressions. It answered their purpose, to\r\njudge by the number of volumes that were consumed. Among the rest, the\r\ngreat library of Vicogne, one of the noblest collections in the\r\nNetherlands, perished in the flames kindled by these fanatics.[820]\r\n\r\nThe amount of injury inflicted during this dismal period it is not\r\npossible to estimate. Four hundred churches were sacked by the\r\ninsurgents in Flanders alone.[821] The damage to the cathedral of\r\nAntwerp, including its precious contents, was said to amount to not less\r\nthan four hundred thousand ducats![822] The loss occasioned by the\r\nplunder of gold and silver plate might be computed. The structures so\r\ncruelly defaced might be repaired by the skill of the architect. But who\r\ncan estimate the irreparable loss occasioned by the destruction of\r\nmanuscripts, statuary, and paintings? It is a melancholy fact, that the\r\nearliest efforts of the Reformers were everywhere directed against those\r\nmonuments of genius which had been created and cherished by the generous\r\npatronage of Catholicism. But if the first step of the Reformation was\r\non the ruins of art, it cannot be denied that a compensation has been\r\nfound in the good which it has done by breaking the fetters of the\r\nintellect, and opening a free range in those domains of science to which\r\nall access had been hitherto denied.\r\n\r\nThe wide extent of the devastation was not more remarkable than the time\r\nin which it was accomplished. The whole work occupied less than a\r\nfortnight. It seemed as if the destroying angel had passed over the\r\nland, and at a blow had consigned its noblest edifices to ruin! The\r\nmethod and discipline, if I may so say, in the movements of the\r\niconoclasts, were as extraordinary as their celerity. They would seem to\r\nhave been directed by some other hands than those which met the vulgar\r\neye. The quantity of gold and silver plate purloined from the churches\r\nand convents was immense. Though doubtless sometimes appropriated by\r\nindividuals, it seems not unfrequently to have been gathered in a heap,\r\nand delivered to the minister, who, either of himself, or by direction\r\nof the consistory, caused it to be melted down, and distributed among\r\nthe most needy of the sectaries.[823] We may sympathize with the\r\nindignation of a Catholic writer of the time, who exclaims, that in this\r\nway the poor churchmen were made to pay for the scourges with which they\r\nhad been beaten.[824]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ALARM AT BRUSSELS.]\r\n\r\nThe tidings of the outbreak fell heavily on the ears of the court of\r\nBrussels, where the regent, notwithstanding her prediction of the\r\nevent, was not any the better prepared for it. She at once called her\r\ncounsellors together and demanded their aid in defending the religion of\r\nthe country against its enemies. But the prince of Orange and his\r\nfriends discouraged a resort to violent measures, as little likely to\r\nprevail in the present temper of the people. \"First,\" said Egmont, \"let\r\nus provide for the security of the state. It will be time enough then to\r\nthink of religion.\" \"No,\" said Margaret, warmly; \"the service of God\r\ndemands our first care; for the ruin of religion would be a greater evil\r\nthan the loss of the country.\"[825] \"Those who have anything to lose in\r\nit,\" replied the count, somewhat coolly, \"will probably be of a\r\ndifferent opinion,\"[826]--an answer that greatly displeased the duchess.\r\n\r\nRumors now came thick on one another of the outrages committed by the\r\nimage-breakers. Fears were entertained that their next move would be on\r\nthe capital itself. Hitherto the presence of the regent had preserved\r\nBrussels, notwithstanding some transient demonstrations among the\r\npeople, from the spirit of reform which had convulsed the rest of the\r\ncountry. No public meetings had been held either in the city or the\r\nsuburbs; for Margaret had declared she would hang up, not only the\r\npreacher, but all those who attended him.[827] The menace had its\r\neffect. Thus keeping aloof from the general movement of the time, the\r\ncapital was looked on with an evil eye by the surrounding country; and\r\nreports were rife, that the iconoclasts were preparing to march in such\r\nforce on the place, as should enable them to deal with it as they had\r\ndone with Antwerp and the other cities of Brabant.\r\n\r\nThe question now arose as to the course to be pursued in the present\r\nexigency. The prince of Orange and his friends earnestly advised that\r\nMargaret should secure the aid of the confederates by the concessions\r\nthey had so strenuously demanded; in the next place, that she should\r\nconciliate the Protestants by consenting to their religious meetings. To\r\nthe former she made no objection. But the latter she peremptorily\r\nrefused. \"It would be the ruin of our holy religion,\" she said. It was\r\nin vain they urged, that two hundred thousand sectaries were in arms;\r\nthat they were already in possession of the churches; that, if she\r\npersisted in her refusal, they would soon be in Brussels, and massacre\r\nevery priest and Roman Catholic before her eyes![828] Notwithstanding\r\nthis glowing picture of the horrors in store for her, Margaret remained\r\ninflexible. But her agitation was excessive: she felt herself alone in\r\nher extremity. The party of Granvelle she had long since abandoned. The\r\nparty of Orange seemed now ready to abandon her. \"I am pressed by\r\nenemies within and without,\" she wrote to Philip; \"there is no one on\r\nwhom I can rely for counsel or for aid.\"[829] Distrust and anxiety\r\nbrought on a fever, and for several days and nights she lay tossing\r\nabout, suffering equally from distress of body and anguish of\r\nspirit.[830]\r\n\r\nThus sorely perplexed, Margaret felt also the most serious apprehensions\r\nfor her personal safety. With the slight means of defence at her\r\ncommand, Brussels seemed no longer a safe residence, and she finally\r\ncame to the resolution to extricate herself from the danger and\r\ndifficulties of her situation by a precipitate flight. After a brief\r\nconsultation with Barlaimont, Arschot, and others of the party opposed\r\nto the prince of Orange, and hitherto little in her confidence, she\r\ndetermined to abandon the capital, and seek a refuge in Mons,--a strong\r\ntown in Hainault, belonging to the duke of Arschot, which, from its\r\nsturdy attachment to the Romish faith, had little to fear from the\r\nfanatics.\r\n\r\nHaving completed her preparations with the greatest secrecy, on the day\r\nfixed for her flight Margaret called her council together to communicate\r\nher design. It met with the most decided opposition, not merely from the\r\nlords with whom she had hitherto acted, but from the president Viglius.\r\nThey all united in endeavoring to turn her from a measure which would\r\nplainly intimate such a want of confidence on the part of the duchess as\r\nmust dishonor them in the eyes of the world. The preparations for\r\nMargaret's flight had not been conducted so secretly but that some rumor\r\nof them had taken wind; and the magistrates of the city now waited on\r\nher in a body, and besought her not to leave them, defenceless as they\r\nwere, to the mercy of their enemies.\r\n\r\nThe prince was heard to say, that, if the regent thus abandoned the\r\ngovernment, it would be necessary to call the states-general together at\r\nonce, to take measures for the protection of the country.[831] And\r\nEgmont declared that, if she fled to Mons, he would muster forty\r\nthousand men, and besiege Mons in person.[832] The threat was not a vain\r\none, for no man in the country could have gathered such a force under\r\nhis banner more easily than Egmont. The question seems to have been\r\nfinally settled by the magistrates causing the gates of the town to be\r\nsecured, and a strong guard placed over them, with orders to allow no\r\npassage either to the duchess or her followers.--Thus a prisoner in her\r\nown capital, Margaret conformed to necessity, and, with the best grace\r\nshe could, consented to relinquish her scheme of departure.[833]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHURCHES GRANTED TO REFORMERS.]\r\n\r\nThe question now recurred as to the course to be pursued; and the more\r\nshe pondered on the embarrassments of her position, the more she became\r\nsatisfied that no means of extricating herself remained but that\r\nproposed by the nobles. Yet, in thus yielding to necessity, she did so\r\nprotesting that she was acting under compulsion.[834] On the\r\ntwenty-third of August, Margaret executed an instrument, by which she\r\nengaged that no harm should come to the members of the league for\r\nanything hitherto done by them. She further authorized the lords to\r\nannounce to the confederates her consent to the religious meetings of\r\nthe Reformed, in places where they had been hitherto held, until his\r\nmajesty and the states-general should otherwise determine. It was on the\r\ncondition, however, that they should go there unarmed, and nowhere offer\r\ndisturbance to the Catholics.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fifth of the month the confederate nobles signed an\r\nagreement on their part and solemnly swore that they would aid the\r\nregent to the utmost in suppressing the disorders of the country, and in\r\nbringing their authors to justice; agreeing, moreover, that, so long as\r\nthe regent should be true to the compact, the league should be\r\nconsidered as null and void.[835]\r\n\r\nThe feelings of Margaret, in making the concessions required of her, may\r\nbe gathered from the perusal of her private correspondence with her\r\nbrother. No act in her public life ever caused her so deep a\r\nmortification; and she never forgave the authors of it. \"It was forced\r\nupon me,\" she writes to Philip; \"but, happily, you will not be bound by\r\nit.\" And she beseeches him to come at once, in such strength as would\r\nenable him to conquer the country for himself, or to give her the means\r\nof doing so.[836]--Margaret, in early life, had been placed in the hands\r\nof Ignatius Loyola. More than one passage in her history proves that the\r\nlessons of the Jesuit had not been thrown away.\r\n\r\nDuring these discussions the panic had been such, that it was thought\r\nadvisable to strengthen the garrison under command of Count Mansfeldt,\r\nand keep the greater part of the citizens under arms day and night. When\r\nthis arrangement was concluded, the great lords dispersed on their\r\nmission to restore order in their several governments. The prince went\r\nfirst to Antwerp, where, as we have seen, he held the office of\r\nburgrave. He made strict investigation into the causes of the late\r\ntumult, hung three of the ringleaders, and banished three others. He\r\nfound it, however, no easy matter to come to terms with the sectaries,\r\nwho had possession of all the churches, from which they had driven the\r\nCatholics. After long negotiation, it was arranged that they should be\r\nallowed to hold six, and should resign the rest to the ancient\r\npossessors. The arrangement gave general satisfaction, and the principal\r\ncitizens and merchants congratulated William on having rescued them from\r\nthe evils of anarchy.\r\n\r\nNot so the regent. She knew well that the example of Antwerp would\r\nbecome a precedent for the rest of the country. She denounced the\r\ncompact, as compromising the interests of Catholicism, and openly\r\naccused the prince of having transcended his powers, and betrayed the\r\ntrust reposed in him. Finally, she wrote, commanding him at once to\r\nrevoke his concessions.\r\n\r\nWilliam, in answer, explained to her the grounds on which they had been\r\nmade, and their absolute necessity, in order to save the city from\r\nanarchy. It is a strong argument in his favor, that the Protestants, who\r\nalready claimed the prince as one of their own sect, accused him, in\r\nthis instance, of sacrificing their cause to that of their enemies; and\r\ncaricatures of him were made, representing him with open hands and a\r\ndouble face.[837] William, while thus explaining his conduct, did not\r\nconceal his indignation at the charges brought against him by the\r\nregent, and renewed his request for leave to resign his offices, since\r\nhe no longer enjoyed her confidence. But whatever disgust she may have\r\nfelt at his present conduct, William's services were too important to\r\nMargaret in this crisis to allow her to dispense with them; and she\r\nmade haste to write to him in a conciliatory tone, explaining away as\r\nfar as possible what had been offensive in her former letters. Yet from\r\nthis hour the consciousness of mutual distrust raised a barrier between\r\nthe parties never to be overcome.[838]\r\n\r\nWilliam next proceeded to his governments of Utrecht and Holland, which,\r\nby a similar course of measures to that pursued at Antwerp, he soon\r\nrestored to order. While in Utrecht, he presented to the states of the\r\nprovince a memorial, in which he briefly reviewed the condition of the\r\ncountry. He urged the necessity of religious toleration, as demanded by\r\nthe spirit of the age, and as particularly necessary in a country like\r\nthat, the resort of so many foreigners, and inhabited by sects of such\r\nvarious denominations. He concluded by recommending them to lay a\r\npetition to that effect before the throne,--not, probably, from any\r\nbelief that such a petition would be heeded by the monarch, but from the\r\neffect it would have in strengthening the principles of religious\r\nfreedom in his countrymen. William's memorial is altogether a remarkable\r\npaper for the time, and in the wise and liberal tenor of its arguments\r\nstrikingly contrasts with the intolerant spirit of the court of\r\nMadrid.[839]\r\n\r\nThe regent proved correct in her prediction that the example of Antwerp\r\nwould be made a precedent for the country. William's friends, the Counts\r\nHoorne and Hoogstraten, employed the same means for conciliating the\r\nsectaries in their own governments. It was otherwise with Egmont. He was\r\ntoo stanch a Catholic at heart to approve of such concessions. He\r\ncarried matters, therefore, with a high hand in his provinces of\r\nFlanders and Artois, where his personal authority was unbounded. He made\r\na severe scrutiny into the causes of the late tumult, and dealt with its\r\nauthors so sternly, as to provoke a general complaint among the reformed\r\nparty, some of whom, indeed, became so far alarmed for their own safety,\r\nthat they left the provinces and went beyond sea.\r\n\r\nOrder now seemed to be reëstablished in the land, through the efforts of\r\nthe nobles, aided by the confederates, who seem to have faithfully\r\nexecuted their part of the compact with the regent. The Protestants took\r\npossession of the churches assigned to them, or busied themselves with\r\nraising others on the ground before reserved for their meetings. All\r\njoined in the good work; the men laboring at the building, the women\r\ngiving their jewels and ornaments to defray the cost of the materials. A\r\ncalm succeeded,--a temporary lull after the hurricane; and Lutheran and\r\nCalvinist again indulged in the pleasing illusion, that, however\r\ndistasteful it might be to the government, they were at length secure of\r\nthe blessings of religious toleration.\r\n\r\nDuring the occurrence of these events a great change had taken place in\r\nthe relations of parties. The Catholic members of the league, who had\r\nproposed nothing beyond the reform of certain glaring abuses, and, least\r\nof all, anything prejudicial to their own religion, were startled as\r\nthey saw the inevitable result of the course they were pursuing. Several\r\nof them, as we have seen, had left the league before the outbreak of the\r\niconoclasts; and after that event, but very few remained in it. The\r\nconfederates, on the other hand, lost ground with the people, who looked\r\nwith distrust on their late arrangement with the regent, in which they\r\nhad so well provided for their own security. The confidence of the\r\npeople was not restored by the ready aid which their old allies seemed\r\nwilling to afford the great nobles in bringing to justice the authors\r\nof the recent disorders.[840] Thus deserted by many of its own members,\r\ndistrusted by the Reformers, and detested by the regent, the league\r\nceased from that period to exert any considerable influence on the\r\naffairs of the country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARGARET REPENTS HER CONCESSIONS.]\r\n\r\nA change equally important had taken place in the politics of the court.\r\nThe main object with Margaret, from the first, had been to secure the\r\npublic tranquillity. To effect this she had more than once so far\r\ndeferred to the judgment of William and his friends, as to pursue a\r\npolicy not the most welcome to herself. But it had never been her\r\nthought to extend that policy to the point of religious toleration. So\r\nfar from it, she declared that, even though the king should admit two\r\nreligions in the state, she would rather be torn in pieces than consent\r\nto it.[841] It was not till the coalition of the nobles, that her eyes\r\nwere opened to the path she was treading. The subsequent outrages of the\r\niconoclasts made her comprehend she was on the verge of a precipice. The\r\nconcessions wrung from her, at that time, by Orange and his friends,\r\nfilled up the measure of her indignation. A great gulf now opened\r\nbetween her and the party by whom she had been so long directed. Yet\r\nwhere could she turn for support? One course only remained; and it was\r\nwith a bitter feeling that she felt constrained to throw herself into\r\nthe arms of the very party which she had almost estranged from her\r\ncounsels. In her extremity she sent for the president Viglius, on whose\r\nhead she had poured out so many anathemas in her correspondence with\r\nPhilip,--whom she had not hesitated to charge with the grossest\r\npeculation.\r\n\r\nMargaret sent for the old councillor, and, with tears in her eyes,\r\ndemanded his advice in the present exigency. The president naturally\r\nexpressed his surprise at this mark of confidence from one who had so\r\ncarefully excluded him from her counsels for the last two years.\r\nMargaret, after some acknowledgment of her mistake, intimated a hope\r\nthat this would be no impediment to his giving her the counsel she now\r\nso much needed. Viglius answered by inquiring whether she were prepared\r\nfaithfully to carry out what she knew to be the will of the king. On\r\nMargaret's replying in the affirmative, he recommended that she should\r\nput the same question to each member of her cabinet. \"Their answers,\"\r\nsaid the old statesman, \"will show you whom you are to trust.\" The\r\nquestion--the touchstone of loyalty--was accordingly put; and the\r\nminister, who relates the anecdote himself, tells us that three only,\r\nMansfeldt, Barlaimont, and Arschot, were prepared to stand by the regent\r\nin carrying out the policy of the crown. From that hour the regent's\r\nconfidence was transferred from the party with which she had hitherto\r\nacted, to their rivals.[842]\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to trace the change of Margaret's sentiments in her\r\ncorrespondence of this period with her brother. \"Orange and Hoorne prove\r\nthemselves, by word and by deed, enemies of God and the king.\"[843] Of\r\nEgmont she speaks no better. \"With all his protestations of loyalty,\"\r\nshe fears he is only plotting mischief to the state. \"He has openly\r\njoined the Gueux, and his eldest daughter is reported to be a\r\nHuguenot.\"[844] Her great concern is for the safety of Viglius, \"almost\r\nparalyzed by his fears, as the people actually threaten to tear him in\r\npieces.\"[845] The factious lords conduct affairs according to their own\r\npleasure in the council; and it is understood they are negotiating at\r\nthe present moment to bring about a collision between the Protestants of\r\nGermany, France, and England, hoping in the end to drive the house of\r\nAustria from the throne, to shake off the yoke of Spain from the\r\nNetherlands, and divide the provinces among themselves and their\r\nfriends![846] Margaret's credulity seems to have been in proportion to\r\nher hatred, and her hatred in proportion to her former friendship. So it\r\nwas in her quarrel with Granvelle, and she now dealt the same measure to\r\nthe men who had succeeded that minister in her confidence.\r\n\r\nThe prince of Orange cared little for the regent's estrangement. He had\r\nlong felt that his own path lay wide asunder from that of the\r\ngovernment, and, as we have seen, had more than once asked leave to\r\nresign his offices, and withdraw into private life. Hoorne viewed the\r\nmatter with equal indifference. He had also asked leave to retire,\r\ncomplaining that his services had been poorly requited by the\r\ngovernment. He was a man of a bold, impatient temper. In a letter to\r\nPhilip he told him that it was not the regent, but his majesty, of whom\r\nhe complained, for compelling him to undergo the annoyance of dancing\r\nattendance at the court of Brussels![847] He further added, that he had\r\nnot discussed his conduct with the duchess, as it was not his way to\r\ntreat of affairs of honor with ladies![848] There was certainly no want\r\nof plain-dealing in this communication with majesty.\r\n\r\nCount Egmont took the coolness of the regent in a very different manner.\r\nIt touched his honor, perhaps his vanity, to be thus excluded from her\r\nconfidence. He felt it the more keenly as he was so loyal at heart, and\r\nstrongly attached to the Romish faith. On the other hand, his generous\r\nnature was deeply sensible to the wrongs of his countrymen. Thus drawn\r\nin opposite directions, he took the middle course,--by no means the\r\nsafest in politics. Under these opposite influences he remained in a\r\nstate of dangerous irresolution. His sympathy with the cause of the\r\nconfederates lost him the confidence of the government. His loyalty to\r\nthe government excluded him from the councils of the confederates. And\r\nthus, though perhaps the most popular man in the Netherlands, there was\r\nno one who possessed less real influence in public affairs.[849]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FEELING AT MADRID.]\r\n\r\nThe tidings of the tumults in the Netherlands, which travelled with the\r\nusual expedition of evil news, caused as great consternation at the\r\ncourt of Castile as it had done at that of Brussels. Philip, on\r\nreceiving his despatches, burst forth, it is said, into the most violent\r\nfit of anger, and, tearing his beard, he exclaimed, \"It shall cost them\r\ndear; by the soul of my father I swear it, it shall cost them\r\ndear!\"[850] The anecdote, often repeated, rests on the authority of\r\nGranvelle's correspondent, Morillon. If it be true, it affords a\r\nsolitary exception to the habitual self-command--displayed in\r\ncircumstances quite as trying--of the \"prudent\" monarch. The account\r\ngiven by Hopper, who was with the court at the time, is the more\r\nprobable of the two. According to that minister, the king, when he\r\nreceived the tidings, lay ill of a tertian fever at Segovia. As letter\r\nafter letter came to him with particulars of the tumult, he maintained\r\nhis usual serenity, exhibiting no sign of passion or vexation. Though\r\nenfeebled by his malady, he allowed himself no repose, but gave\r\nunremitting attention to business.[851] He read all the despatches; made\r\ncareful notes of their contents, sending such information as he deemed\r\nbest to his council, for their consideration; and, as his health mended,\r\noccasionally attended in person the discussions of that body.\r\n\r\nOne can feel but little doubt as to the light in which the proceedings\r\nin the Netherlands were regarded by the royal council of Castile. Yet it\r\ndid not throw the whole, or even the chief blame, on the iconoclasts.\r\nThey were regarded as mere tools in the hands of the sectaries. The\r\nsectaries, on their part, were, it was said, moved by the confederates,\r\non whom they leaned for protection. The confederates, in their turn,\r\nmade common cause with the great lords, to whom many of them were bound\r\nby the closest ties of friendship and of blood. By this ingenious chain\r\nof reasoning, all were made responsible for the acts of violence; but\r\nthe chief responsibility lay on the heads of the great nobles, on whom\r\nall in the last resort depended. It was against them that the public\r\nindignation should be directed, not against the meaner offenders, over\r\nwhom alone the sword of justice had been hitherto suspended. But the\r\nking should dissemble his sentiments until he was in condition to call\r\nthese great vassals to account for their misdeeds. All joined in\r\nbeseeching Philip to defer no longer his visit to Flanders; and most of\r\nthem recommended that he should go in such force as to look down\r\nopposition, and crush the rebellion in its birth.\r\n\r\nSuch was the counsel of Alva, in conformity with that which he had\r\nalways given on the subject. But although all concurred in urging the\r\nking to expedite his departure, some of the councillors followed the\r\nprince of Eboli in advising Philip that, instead of this warlike\r\npanoply, he should go in peaceable guise, accompanied only by such a\r\nretinue as befitted the royal dignity. Each of the great rivals\r\nrecommended the measures most congenial with his own temper, the\r\ndirection of which would no doubt be intrusted to the man who\r\nrecommended them. It is not strange that the more violent course should\r\nhave found favor with the majority.[852]\r\n\r\nPhilip's own decision he kept, as usual, locked in his own bosom. He\r\nwrote indeed to his sister, warning her not to allow the meeting of the\r\nlegislature, and announcing his speedy coming,--all as usual; and he\r\nadded, that, in repressing the disorders of the country, he should use\r\nno other means than those of gentleness and kindness, under the sanction\r\nof the states.[853] These gentle professions weighed little with those\r\nwho, like the prince of Orange, had surer means of arriving at the\r\nking's intent than what were afforded by the royal correspondence.\r\nMontigny, the Flemish envoy, was still in Madrid, held there, sorely\r\nagainst his will, in a sort of honorable captivity by Philip. In a\r\nletter to his brother, Count Hoorne, he wrote: \"Nothing can be in worse\r\nodor than our affairs at the court of Castile. The great lords, in\r\nparticular, are considered as the source of all the mischief. Violent\r\ncounsels are altogether in the ascendant, and the storm may burst on you\r\nsooner than you think. Nothing remains but to fly from it like a prudent\r\nman, or to face it like a brave one!\"[854]\r\n\r\nWilliam had other sources of intelligence, the secret agents whom he\r\nkept in pay at Madrid. From them he learned, not only what was passing\r\nat the court, but in the very cabinet of the monarch; and extracts,\r\nsometimes full copies, of the correspondence of Philip and Margaret,\r\nwere transmitted to the prince. Thus the secrets which the most jealous\r\nprince in Europe supposed to be locked in his own breast were often in\r\npossession of his enemies; and William, as we are told, declared that\r\nthere was no word of Philip's, public or private, but was reported to\r\nhis ears![855]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FEELING AT MADRID.]\r\n\r\nThis secret intelligence, on which the prince expended large sums of\r\nmoney, was not confined to Madrid. He maintained a similar system of\r\nespionage in Paris, where the court of Castile was busy with its\r\nintrigues for the extermination of heresy. Those who look on these\r\ntrickish proceedings as unworthy of the character of the prince of\r\nOrange and the position which he held, should consider that it was in\r\naccordance with the spirit of the age. It was but turning Philip's own\r\narts against himself, and using the only means by which William could\r\nhope to penetrate the dark and unscrupulous policy of a cabinet whose\r\nchief aim, as he thought, was to subvert the liberties of his country.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that his agents in France intercepted a letter from\r\nAlava, the Spanish minister at the French court. It was addressed to the\r\nduchess of Parma. Among other things, the writer says it is well\r\nunderstood at Madrid, that the great nobles are at the bottom of the\r\ntroubles of Flanders. The king is levying a strong force, with which he\r\nwill soon visit the country, and call the three lords to a heavy\r\nreckoning. In the mean time the duchess must be on her guard not by any\r\nchange in her deportment to betray her consciousness of this\r\nintent.[856]\r\n\r\nThus admonished from various quarters, the prince felt that it was no\r\nlonger safe for him to remain in his present position; and that in the\r\nwords of Montigny, he must be prepared to fight or to fly. He resolved\r\nto take counsel with some of those friends who were similarly situated\r\nwith himself. In a communication made to Egmont in order to persuade him\r\nto a conference, William speaks of Philip's military preparations as\r\nequally to be dreaded by Catholic and Protestant; for under the pretext\r\nof religion, Philip had no other object in view than to enslave the\r\nnation. \"This has been always feared by us,\" he adds;[857] \"and I cannot\r\nstay to witness the ruin of my country.\"\r\n\r\nThe parties met at Dendermonde on the third of October. Besides the two\r\nfriends and Count Hoorne, there were William's brother, Louis, and a few\r\nother persons of consideration. Little is actually known of the\r\nproceedings at this conference, notwithstanding the efforts of more than\r\none officious chronicler to enlighten us. Their contradictory accounts,\r\nlike so many cross lights on his path, serve only to perplex the eye of\r\nthe student. It seems probable, however, that the nobles generally,\r\nincluding the prince, considered the time had arrived for active\r\nmeasures; and that any armed intrusion on the part of Philip into the\r\nNetherlands should be resisted by force. But Egmont, with all his causes\r\nof discontent, was too loyal at heart not to shrink from the attitude of\r\nrebellion. He had a larger stake than most of the company, in a numerous\r\nfamily of children, who, in case of a disastrous revolution, would be\r\nthrown helpless on the world. The benignity with which he had been\r\nreceived by Philip on his mission to Spain, and which subsequent slights\r\nhad not effaced from his memory, made him confide, most unhappily, in\r\nthe favorable dispositions of the monarch. From whatever motives, the\r\ncount refused to become a party to any scheme of resistance; and as his\r\npopularity with the troops made his coöperation of the last importance,\r\nthe conference broke up without coming to a determination.[858]\r\n\r\nEgmont at once repaired to Brussels, whither he had been summoned by the\r\nregent to attend the council of state. Orange and Hoorne received, each,\r\na similar summons, to which neither of them paid any regard. Before\r\ntaking his seat at the board, Egmont showed the duchess Alava's letter,\r\nupbraiding her, at the same time, with her perfidious conduct towards\r\nthe nobles. Margaret, who seems to have given way to temper or to tears,\r\nas the exigency demanded, broke forth into a rage, declaring it \"an\r\nimpudent forgery, and the greatest piece of villany in the world!\"[859]\r\nThe same sentiment she repeats in a letter addressed soon after to her\r\nbrother, in which she asserts her belief that no such letter as that\r\nimputed to Alava had ever been written by him. How far the duchess was\r\nhonest in her declaration it is impossible at this day to determine.\r\nEgmont, after passing to other matters, concludes with a remark which\r\nshows, plainly enough, his own opinion of her sincerity. \"In fine, she\r\nis a woman educated in Rome. There is no faith to be given to her.\"[860]\r\n\r\nIn her communication above noticed Margaret took occasion to complain to\r\nPhilip of his carelessness in regard to her letters. The contents of\r\nthem, she said, were known in Flanders almost as soon as at Madrid; and\r\nnot only copies, but the original autographs, were circulating in\r\nBrussels. She concludes by begging her brother, if he cannot keep her\r\nletters safe, to burn them.[861]\r\n\r\nThe king, in answer, expresses his surprise at her complaints, assuring\r\nMargaret that it is impossible any one can have seen her letters, which\r\nare safely locked up, with the key in his own pocket.[862] It is amusing\r\nto see Philip's incredulity in regard to the practice of those arts on\r\nhimself which he had so often practised on others. His sister, however,\r\nseems to have relied henceforth more on her own precautions than on his,\r\nas we find her communications from this time frequently shrouded in\r\ncipher.\r\n\r\nRumors of Philip's warlike preparations were now rife in the\r\nNetherlands; and the Protestants began to take counsel as to the best\r\nmeans of providing for their own defence. One plan suggested was to send\r\nthirty thousand Calvinistic tracts to Seville for distribution among the\r\nSpaniards.[863] This would raise a good crop of heresy, and give the\r\nking work to do in his own dominions. It would, in short, be carrying\r\nthe war into the enemy's country. The plan, it must be owned, had the\r\nmerit of novelty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WILLIAM'S RELIGIOUS OPINIONS.]\r\n\r\nIn Holland the nobles and merchants mutually bound themselves to stand\r\nby one another in asserting the right of freedom of conscience.[864]\r\nLevies went forward briskly in Germany, under the direction of Count\r\nLouis of Nassau. It was attempted, moreover, to interest the Protestant\r\nprinces of that country so far in the fate of their brethren in the\r\nNetherlands as to induce them to use their good offices with Philip to\r\ndissuade him from violent measures. The emperor had already offered\r\nprivately his own mediation to the king, to bring about, if possible, a\r\nbetter understanding with his Flemish subjects.[865] The offer made in\r\nso friendly a spirit, though warmly commended by some of the council,\r\nseems to have found no favor in the eyes of their master.[866]\r\n\r\nThe princes of Germany who had embraced the Reformation were Lutherans.\r\nThey had almost as little sympathy with the Calvinists as with the\r\nCatholics. Men of liberal minds in the Netherlands, like William and his\r\nbrother, would gladly have seen the two great Protestant parties which\r\ndivided their country united on some common basis. They would have had\r\nthem, in short, in a true Christian spirit, seek out the points on which\r\nthey could agree rather than those on which they differed,--points of\r\ndifference which, in William's estimation, were after all of minor\r\nimportance. He was desirous that the Calvinists should adopt a\r\nconfession of faith accommodated in some degree to the \"Confession of\r\nAugsburg,\"--a step which would greatly promote their interests with the\r\nprinces of Germany.[867]\r\n\r\nBut the Calvinists were altogether the dominant party in the Low\r\nCountries. They were thoroughly organized, and held their consistories,\r\ncomposed of a senate and a sort of lower house, in many of the great\r\ntowns, all subordinate to the great consistory at Antwerp. They formed,\r\nin short, what the historian well calls an independent Protestant\r\nrepublic.[868] Strong in their power, sturdy in their principles, they\r\nrefused to bend in any degree to circumstances, or to make any\r\nconcession, or any compromise with the weaker party. The German princes,\r\ndisgusted with this conduct, showed no disposition to take any active\r\nmeasures in their behalf, and, although they made some efforts in favor\r\nof the Lutherans, left their Calvinistic brethren in the Netherlands to\r\ntheir fate.\r\n\r\nIt was generally understood, at this time, that the prince of Orange had\r\nembraced Lutheran opinions. His wife's uncle, the landgrave of Hesse,\r\npressed him publicly to avow his belief. To this the prince objected,\r\nthat he should thus become the open enemy of the Catholics, and probably\r\nlose his influence with the Calvinists, already too well disposed to\r\nacts of violence.[869] Yet not long after we find William inquiring of\r\nthe landgrave if it would not be well to advise the king, in terms as\r\nlittle offensive as possible, of his change of religion, asking the\r\nroyal permission at the same time, to conform his worship to it.[870]\r\n\r\nWilliam's father had been a Lutheran, and in that faith had lived and\r\ndied. In that faith he had educated his son. When only eleven years old,\r\nthe latter, as we have seen, was received into the imperial household.\r\nThe plastic mind of boyhood readily took its impressions from those\r\naround, and without much difficulty, or indeed examination, William\r\nconformed to the creed fashionable at the court of Castile. In this\r\nfaith--if so it should be called--the prince remained during the\r\nlifetime of the emperor. Then came the troubles of the Netherlands; and\r\nWilliam's mind yielded to other influences. He saw the workings of\r\nCatholicism under a terrible aspect. He beheld his countrymen dragged\r\nfrom their firesides, driven into exile, thrown into dungeons, burned at\r\nthe stake; and all this for no other cause than dissent from the dogmas\r\nof the Romish Church. His soul sickened at these enormities, and his\r\nindignation kindled at this invasion of the inalienable right of private\r\njudgment. Thus deeply interested for the oppressed Protestants, it was\r\nnatural that William should feel a sympathy for their cause. His wife\r\ntoo was of the Lutheran persuasion. So was his mother, still surviving.\r\nSo were his brothers and sisters, and indeed all those nearest akin to\r\nhim. Under these influences, public and domestic, it was not strange,\r\nthat he should have been led to review the grounds of his own belief;\r\nthat he should have gradually turned to the faith of his parents,--the\r\nfaith in which he had been nurtured in childhood.[871] At what precise\r\nperiod the change in his opinions took place we are not informed. But\r\nhis letter to the landgrave of Hesse, in November, 1566, affords, so far\r\nas I am aware, the earliest evidence that exists, under his own hand,\r\nthat he had embraced the doctrines of the Reformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE REGENT'S AUTHORITY REËSTABLISHED.\r\n\r\nReaction.--Appeal to Arms.--Tumult in Antwerp.--Siege of\r\nValenciennes.--The Government triumphant.\r\n\r\n1566, 1567.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe excesses of the iconoclasts, like most excesses, recoiled on the\r\nheads of those who committed them. The Roman Catholic members of the\r\nleague withdrew, as we have seen, from an association which connected\r\nthem, however remotely, with deeds so atrocious. Other Catholics, who\r\nhad looked with no unfriendly eye on the revolution, now that they saw\r\nit was to go forward over the ruins of their religion, were only eager\r\nto show their detestation of it, and their loyalty to the government.\r\nThe Lutherans, who, as already noticed, had never moved in much harmony\r\nwith the Calvinists, were anxious to throw the whole blame of the\r\nexcesses on the rival sect; and thus the breach, growing wider and wider\r\nbetween the two great divisions of the Protestants, worked infinite\r\nprejudice to the common cause of reform. Lastly, men like Egmont, who\r\nfrom patriotic motives had been led to dally with the revolution in its\r\ninfancy, seeming indeed almost ready to embrace it, now turned coldly\r\naway, and hastened to make their peace with the regent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: REACTION.]\r\n\r\nMargaret felt the accession of strength she was daily deriving from\r\nthese divisions of her enemies, and she was not slow to profit by it. As\r\nshe had no longer confidence in those on whom she had hitherto relied\r\nfor support, she was now obliged to rely more exclusively on herself.\r\nShe was indefatigable in her application to business. \"I know not,\"\r\nwrites her secretary, Armenteros, \"how the regent contrives to live,\r\namidst the disgusts and difficulties which incessantly beset her. For\r\nsome months she has risen before dawn. Every morning and evening,\r\nsometimes oftener, she calls her council together. The rest of the day\r\nand night she is occupied with giving audiences, or with receiving\r\ndespatches and letters, or in answering them.\"[872]\r\n\r\nMargaret now bent all her efforts to retrace the humiliating path into\r\nwhich she had been led, and to reëstablish the fallen authority of the\r\ncrown. If she did not actually revoke the concessions wrung from her,\r\nshe was careful to define them so narrowly that they should be of little\r\nservice to any one. She wrote to the governors of the provinces, that\r\nher license for public preaching was to be taken literally, and was by\r\nno means intended to cover the performance of other religious rites, as\r\nthose of baptism, marriage, and burial, which she understood were freely\r\npractised by the reformed ministers. She published an edict reciting the\r\nterrible penalties of the law against all offenders in this way, and she\r\nenjoined the authorities to enforce the execution of it to the\r\nletter.[873]\r\n\r\nThe Protestants loudly complained of what they termed a most perfidious\r\npolicy on the part of the regent. The right of public preaching, they\r\nsaid, naturally included that of performing the other religious\r\nceremonies of the Reformed Church. It was a cruel mockery to allow men\r\nto profess a religion, and yet not to practise the rites which belong to\r\nit.--The construction given by Margaret to her edict must be admitted to\r\nsavor somewhat of the spirit of that given by Portia to Shylock's\r\ncontract. The pound of flesh might indeed be taken; but if so much as a\r\ndrop of blood followed, woe to him that took it!\r\n\r\nThis measure was succeeded by others on the part of the government of a\r\nstill more decisive character. Instead of the civil magistracy, Margaret\r\nnow showed her purpose to call in the aid of a strong military force to\r\nexecute the laws. She ordered into the country the levies lately raised\r\nfor her in Germany. These she augmented by a number of Walloon\r\nregiments; and she placed them under the command of Aremberg, Megen, and\r\nother leaders in whom she confided. She did not even omit the prince of\r\nOrange, for though Margaret had but little confidence in William, she\r\ndid not care to break with him. To the provincial governors she wrote to\r\nstrengthen themselves as much as possible by additional recruits; and\r\nshe ordered them to introduce garrisons into such places as had shown\r\nfavor to the new doctrines.\r\n\r\nThe province of Hainault was that which gave the greatest uneasiness to\r\nthe regent. The spirit of independence was proverbially high amongst the\r\npeople; and the neighborhood of France gave easy access to the Huguenot\r\nministers, who reaped an abundant harvest in the great towns of that\r\ndistrict. The flourishing commercial city of Valenciennes was\r\nparticularly tainted with heresy. Margaret ordered Philip de\r\nNoircarmes, governor of Hainault, to secure the obedience of the place\r\nby throwing into it a garrison of three companies of horse and as many\r\nof foot.\r\n\r\nWhen the regent's will was announced to the people of Valenciennes, it\r\nmet at first with no opposition. But among the ministers in the town was\r\na Frenchman named La Grange, a bold enthusiast, gifted with a stirring\r\neloquence, which gave him immense ascendancy over the masses. This man\r\ntold the people, that to receive a garrison would be the death-blow to\r\ntheir liberties, and that those of the reformed religion would be the\r\nfirst victims. Thus warned, the citizens were now even more unanimous in\r\nrefusing a garrison than they had before been in their consent to admit\r\none. Noircarmes, though much surprised by this sudden change, gave the\r\ninhabitants some days to consider the matter before placing themselves\r\nin open resistance to the government. The magistrates and some of the\r\nprincipal persons in the town were willing to obey his requisition, and\r\nbesought La Grange to prevail on the people to consent to it. \"I would\r\nrather,\" replied the high-spirited preacher, \"that my tongue should\r\ncleave to the roof of my mouth, and that I should become dumb as a fish,\r\nthan open my lips to persuade the people to consent to so cruel and\r\noutrageous an act.\"[874] Finding the inhabitants still obstinate, the\r\ngeneral, by Margaret's orders, proclaimed the city to be in a state of\r\nrebellion,--proscribed the persons of the citizens as traitors to their\r\nsovereign, and confiscated their property. At the same time, active\r\npreparations were begun for laying siege to the place, and proclamation\r\nwas made in the regent's name prohibiting the people of the Netherlands\r\nfrom affording any aid, by counsel, arms, or money, to the rebellious\r\ncity, under the penalties incurred by treason.\r\n\r\nBut the inhabitants of Valenciennes, sustained by the promises of their\r\npreacher, were nothing daunted by these measures, nor by the formidable\r\nshow of troops which Noircarmes was assembling under their walls. Their\r\ntown was strongly situated, tolerably well victualled for a siege, and\r\nfilled with a population of hardy burghers devoted to the cause, whose\r\nspirits were raised by the exhortations of the consistories in the\r\nneighboring provinces to be of good courage, as their brethren would\r\nspeedily come to their relief.\r\n\r\nThe high-handed measures of the government caused great consternation\r\nthrough the country, especially amongst those of the reformed religion.\r\nA brisk correspondence went on between the members of the league and the\r\nconsistories. Large sums were raised by the merchants well affected to\r\nthe cause, in order to levy troops in Germany, and were intrusted to\r\nBrederode for the purpose. It was also determined that a last effort\r\nshould be made to soften the duchess by means of a petition, which that\r\nchief, at the head of four hundred knights, was to bear to Brussels. But\r\nMargaret had had enough of petitions, and she bluntly informed\r\nBrederode, that, if he came in that guise, he would find the gates of\r\nBrussels shut against him.\r\n\r\nStill the sturdy cavalier was not to be balked in his purpose; and, by\r\nmeans of an agent, he caused the petition to be laid before the regent.\r\nIt was taken up mainly with a remonstrance on the course pursued by\r\nMargaret, so much at variance with her promises. It particularly\r\nenlarged on the limitation of her license for public preaching. In\r\nconclusion, it besought the regent to revoke her edict, to disband her\r\nforces, to raise the siege of Valenciennes, and to respect the agreement\r\nshe had made with the league; in which case they were ready to assure\r\nher of their support in maintaining order.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: APPEAL TO ARMS.]\r\n\r\nMargaret laid the document before her council, and on the sixteenth of\r\nFebruary, 1567, an answer which might be rather said to be addressed to\r\nthe country at large than to Brederode, was published. The duchess\r\nintimated her surprise that any mention should be made of the league, as\r\nshe had supposed that body had ceased to exist, since so many of its\r\nmembers had been but too glad, after the late outrages, to make their\r\npeace with the government. As to her concession of public preaching, it\r\ncould hardly be contended that that was designed to authorize the\r\nsectaries to lay taxes, levy troops, create magistrates, and to perform,\r\namong other religious rites, that of marriage, involving the transfer of\r\nlarge amounts of property. She could hardly be thought mad enough to\r\ninvest them with powers like these. She admonished the petitioners not\r\nto compel their sovereign to forego his native benignity of disposition.\r\nIt would be well for them, she hinted, to give less heed to public\r\naffairs, and more to their own; and she concluded with the assurance,\r\nthat she would take good care that the ruin which they so confidently\r\npredicted for the country should not be brought about by them.[875]\r\n\r\nThe haughty tone of the reply showed too plainly that the times were\r\nchanged; that Margaret was now conscious of her strength, and meant to\r\nuse it. The confederates felt that the hour had come for action. To\r\nretrace their steps was impossible. Yet their present position was full\r\nof peril. The rumor went that King Philip was soon to come, at the head\r\nof a powerful force, to take vengeance on his enemies. To remain as they\r\nwere, without resistance, would be to offer their necks to the stroke of\r\nthe executioner. An appeal to arms was all that was left to them. This\r\nwas accordingly resolved on. The standard of revolt was raised. The drum\r\nbeat to arms in the towns and villages, and recruits were everywhere\r\nenlisted. Count Louis was busy in enforcing levies in Germany.\r\nBrederode's town of Viana was named as the place of rendezvous. That\r\nchief was now in his element. His restless spirit delighted in scenes of\r\ntumult. He had busied himself in strengthening the works of Viana, and\r\nin furnishing it with artillery and military stores. Thence he had\r\nsecretly passed over to Amsterdam, where he was occupied in organizing\r\nresistance among the people, already, by their fondness for the new\r\ndoctrines, well disposed to it.\r\n\r\nHostilities first broke out in Brabant, where Count Megen was foiled in\r\nan attempt on Bois-le-Duc, which had refused to receive a garrison. He\r\nwas more fortunate in an expedition against the refractory city of\r\nUtrecht, which surrendered without a struggle to the royalist chief.\r\n\r\nIn other quarters the insurgents were not idle. A body of some two\r\nthousand men, under Marnix, lord of Thoulouse, brother of the famous St.\r\nAldegonde, made a descent on the island of Walcheren, where it was\r\nsupposed Philip would land. But they were baffled in their attempts on\r\nthis place by the loyalty and valor of the inhabitants. Failing in this\r\nscheme, Thoulouse was compelled to sail up the Scheldt, until he reached\r\nthe little village of Austruweel, about a league from Antwerp. There he\r\ndisembarked his whole force, and took up his quarters in the dwellings\r\nof the inhabitants. From this place he sallied out, making depredations\r\non the adjoining country, burning the churches, sacking the convents,\r\nand causing great alarm to the magistrates of Antwerp by the confidence\r\nwhich his presence gave to the reformed party in that city.\r\n\r\nMargaret saw the necessity of dislodging the enemy without delay from\r\nthis dangerous position. She despatched a body of Walloons on the\r\nservice, under command of an experienced officer named Launoy. Her\r\norders show the mood she was in. \"They are miscreants,\" she said, \"who\r\nhave placed themselves beyond the pale of mercy. Show them no mercy\r\nthen, but exterminate with fire and sword!\"[876] Launoy, by a rapid\r\nmarch, arrived at Austruweel. Though taken unawares, Thoulouse and his\r\nmen made a gallant resistance; and a fierce action took place almost\r\nunder the walls of Antwerp.\r\n\r\nThe noise of the musketry soon brought the citizens to the ramparts; and\r\nthe dismay of the Calvinists was great, as they beheld the little army\r\nof Thoulouse thus closely beset by their enemies. Furious at the\r\nspectacle, they now called on one another to rush to the rescue of their\r\nfriends. Pouring down from the ramparts, they hurried to the gates of\r\nthe city. But the gates were locked. This had been done by the order of\r\nthe prince of Orange, who had moreover caused a bridge across the\r\nScheldt to be broken down to cut off all communication between the city\r\nand the camp of Thoulouse.\r\n\r\nThe people now loudly called on the authorities to deliver up the keys,\r\ndemanding for what purpose the gates were closed. Their passions were\r\nkindled to madness by the sight of the wife--now, alas! the widow--of\r\nThoulouse, who, with streaming eyes and dishevelled hair, rushing wildly\r\ninto the crowd, besought them piteously to save her husband and their\r\nown brethren from massacre.\r\n\r\nIt was too late. After a short though stout resistance, the insurgents\r\nhad been driven from the field, and taken refuge in their defences.\r\nThese were soon set on fire. Thoulouse, with many of his followers,\r\nperished in the flames. Others, to avoid this dreadful fate, cut their\r\nway through the enemy, and plunged into the Scheldt, which washes the\r\nbase of the high land occupied by the village. There they miserably\r\nperished in the waters, or were pierced by the lances of the enemy, who\r\nhovered on its borders. Fifteen hundred were slain. Three hundred, who\r\nsurvived, surrendered themselves prisoners. But Launoy feared an attempt\r\nat rescue from the neighboring city; and, true to the orders of the\r\nregent, he massacred nearly all of them on the spot![877]\r\n\r\nWhile this dismal tragedy was passing, the mob imprisoned within the\r\nwalls of Antwerp was raging and bellowing like the waves of the ocean\r\nchafing wildly against the rocks that confine them. With fierce cries,\r\nthey demanded that the gates should be opened, calling on the\r\nmagistrates with bitter imprecations to deliver up the keys. The\r\nmagistrates had no mind to face the infuriated populace. But the prince\r\nof Orange fortunately, at this crisis, did not hesitate to throw himself\r\ninto the midst of the tumult, and take on himself the whole\r\nresponsibility of the affair. It was by his command that the gates had\r\nbeen closed, in order that the regent's troops, if victorious, might not\r\nenter the city, and massacre those of the reformed religion. This\r\nplausible explanation did not satisfy the people. Some called out that\r\nthe true motive was, not to save the Calvinists in the city, but to\r\nprevent their assisting their brethren in the camp. One man, more\r\naudacious than the rest, raised a musket to the prince's breast,\r\nsaluting him, at the same time, with the epithet of \"traitor!\" But the\r\nfellow received no support from his companions, who, in general,\r\nentertained too great respect for William to offer any violence to his\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TUMULT IN ANTWERP.]\r\n\r\nUnable to appease the tumult, the prince was borne along by the tide,\r\nwhich now rolled back from the gates to the Meer Bridge, where it soon\r\nreceived such accessions that the number amounted to more than ten\r\nthousand. The wildest schemes were then agitated by the populace, among\r\nwhom no one appeared to take the lead. Some were for seizing the _Hôtel\r\nde Ville_, and turning out the magistrates. Others were for sacking the\r\nconvents, and driving their inmates, as well as all priests, from the\r\ncity. Meanwhile, they had got possession of some pieces of artillery\r\nfrom the arsenal, with which they fortified the bridge. Thus passed the\r\nlong night;--the armed multitude gathered together like a dark cloud,\r\nready at any moment to burst in fury on the city, while the defenceless\r\nburghers, especially those who had any property at stake, were filled\r\nwith the most dismal apprehensions.\r\n\r\nYet the Catholics contrived to convey some casks of powder, it is said,\r\nunder the Meer Bridge, resolving to blow it into the air with all upon\r\nit, as soon as their enemies should make a hostile movement.\r\n\r\nAll eyes were now turned on the prince of Orange as the only man at all\r\ncapable of extricating them from their perilous situation. William had\r\nstationed a guard over the mint, and another at the _Hôtel de Ville_, to\r\nprotect these buildings from the populace. A great part of this anxious\r\nnight he spent in endeavoring to bring about such an understanding\r\nbetween the two great parties of the Catholics and the Lutherans as\r\nshould enable them to act in concert. This was the less difficult, on\r\naccount of the jealousy which the latter sect entertained of the\r\nCalvinists. The force thus raised was swelled by the accession of the\r\nprincipal merchants and men of substance, as well as most of the\r\nforeigners resident in the city, who had less concern for spiritual\r\nmatters than for the security of life and fortune. The following morning\r\nbeheld the mob of Calvinists formed into something like a military\r\narray, their green and white banners bravely unfurled, and the cannon\r\nwhich they had taken from the arsenal posted in front. On the opposite\r\nside of the great square before the _Hôtel de Ville_ were gathered the\r\nforces of the prince of Orange, which, if wanting artillery, were\r\nconsiderably superior in numbers to their adversaries. The two hosts now\r\nstood face to face, as if waiting only the signal to join in mortal\r\nconflict. But no man was found bold enough to give the signal--for\r\nbrother to lift his hand against brother.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture William, with a small guard, and accompanied by the\r\nprincipal magistrates, crossed over to the enemy's ranks, and demanded\r\nan interview with the leaders. He represented to them the madness of\r\ntheir present course; which, even if they were victorious, must work\r\ninfinite mischief to the cause. It would be easy for them to obtain by\r\nfair means all they could propose by violence; and for his own part, he\r\nconcluded, however well disposed to them he now might be, if a single\r\ndrop of blood were shed in this quarrel, he would hold them from that\r\nhour as enemies.\r\n\r\nThe remonstrance of the prince, aided by the conviction of their own\r\ninferiority in numbers, prevailed over the stubborn temper of the\r\nCalvinists. They agreed to an accommodation, one of the articles of\r\nwhich was, that no garrison should be admitted within the city. The\r\nprince of Orange subscribed and swore to the treaty, on behalf of his\r\nparty: and it is proof of the confidence that even the Calvinists\r\nreposed in him, that they laid down their arms sooner than either the\r\nLutherans or the Catholics. Both these, however, speedily followed their\r\nexample. The martial array, which had assumed so menacing an aspect,\r\nsoon melted away. The soldier of an hour, subsiding into the quiet\r\nburgher, went about his usual business; and tranquillity and order once\r\nmore reigned within the walls of Antwerp.--Thus, by the coolness and\r\ndiscretion of a single man, the finest city in the Netherlands was saved\r\nfrom irretrievable ruin.[878]\r\n\r\nIt was about the middle of March, 1567, that the disturbances occurred\r\nat Antwerp. During this time Noircarmes was enforcing the blockade of\r\nValenciennes, but with little prospect of bringing it to a speedy issue.\r\nThe inhabitants, confident in their strength, had made more than one\r\nsuccessful sally, burning the cloisters in which the general had lodged\r\npart of his troops, and carrying back considerable booty into the city.\r\nIt was evident that to reduce the place by blockade would be a work of\r\nno little time.\r\n\r\nMargaret wrote to her brother to obtain his permission to resort to more\r\nvigorous measures, and, without further delay, to bombard the place. But\r\nPhilip peremptorily refused. It was much to his regret, he said, that\r\nthe siege of so fair a city had been undertaken. Since it had been,\r\nnothing remained but to trust to a blockade for its reduction.[879]\r\n\r\nAt this time an army of the confederates, some three or four thousand\r\nstrong, appeared in the neighborhood of Tournay, designed partly to\r\nprotect that town, which had refused a garrison, and partly to create a\r\ndiversion in favor of Valenciennes. No sooner had Noircarmes got tidings\r\nof this, than, leaving a sufficient detachment to carry on the blockade,\r\nhe made a rapid march with the rest of his forces, came suddenly on the\r\nenemy, engaged him in a pitched battle, completely routed him, and drove\r\nhis scattered legions up to the walls of Tournay. That city, now\r\nincapable of resistance, opened its gates at once, and submitted to the\r\nterms of the conqueror, who soon returned, with his victorious army, to\r\nresume the siege of Valenciennes.\r\n\r\nBut the confidence of the inhabitants was not shaken. On the contrary,\r\nunder the delusive promises of their preacher, it seemed to rise higher\r\nthan ever, and they rejected with scorn every invitation to surrender.\r\nAgain the regent wrote to her brother, that, unless he allowed more\r\nactive operations, there was great danger the place would be relieved by\r\nthe Huguenots on the frontier, or by the _Gueux_, whose troops were\r\nscattered through the country.\r\n\r\nUrged by the last consideration, Philip yielded a reluctant assent to\r\nhis sister's wishes. But in his letter, dated on the thirteenth of\r\nMarch, he insisted that, before resorting to violence, persuasion and\r\nmenace should be first tried; and that, in case of an assault, great\r\ncare should be had that no harm came to the old and infirm, to women or\r\nchildren, to any, in short, who were not found actually in arms against\r\nthe government.[880]--The clemency shown by Philip on this occasion\r\nreflects infinite credit on him; and if it be disposed of by some as\r\nmere policy, it must be allowed to be a policy near akin to humanity. It\r\nforms a striking contrast with the ferocious mood in which Margaret\r\nindulged at this time, when she seems to have felt that a long arrear of\r\nvengeance was due for the humiliations she had been compelled to endure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SIEGE OF VALENCIENNES.]\r\n\r\nThe regent lost no time in profiting by the royal license. She first,\r\nhowever, proposed, in obedience to her instructions, to see what could\r\nbe done by milder measures. She sent two envoys, Count Egmont and the\r\nduke of Arschot, to Valenciennes, in order to expostulate with the\r\ncitizens, and if possible bring them to reason. The two nobles\r\nrepresented to the people the folly of attempting to cope, thus\r\nsingle-handed, as it were, with the government. Their allies had been\r\ndiscomfited one after another. With the defeat before Tournay must have\r\nfaded the last ray of hope. They besought the citizens to accept, while\r\nthere was time, the grace proffered them by the duchess, who was\r\nwilling, if the town submitted, that such as chose to leave it might\r\ntake their effects and go wherever they listed.\r\n\r\nBut the people of Valenciennes, fortified by the promises of their\r\nleaders, and with a blind confidence in their own resources, which had\r\nhitherto proved effectual, held lightly both the arguments and offers of\r\nthe envoys, who returned to the camp of Noircarmes greatly disgusted\r\nwith the ill-success of their mission. There was no room for further\r\ndelay, and preparations were made for reducing the place by more active\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nValenciennes stands on the crest of an eminence that sweeps down by a\r\ngradual slope towards the river Scheldt, which, washing the walls of the\r\ncity, forms a good defence on that quarter. The ramparts encompassing\r\nthe town, originally strong and of great thickness, were now somewhat\r\nimpaired by age. They were protected by a wide ditch, which in some\r\nplaces was partially choked up with rubbish. The walls were well lined\r\nwith artillery, and the magazines provided with ammunition. In short,\r\nthe place was one which, in earlier days, from the strength of its works\r\nas well as its natural position, might have embarrassed an army more\r\nformidable than that which now lay before it.\r\n\r\nThe first step of Noircarmes was to contract his lines, and closely to\r\ninvest the town. He next availed himself of a dark and stormy night to\r\nattack one of the suburbs, which he carried after a sharp engagement,\r\nand left in the charge of some companies of Walloons.\r\n\r\nThe following day these troops opened a brisk fire on the soldiers who\r\ndefended the ramparts, which was returned by the latter with equal\r\nspirit. But while amusing the enemy in this quarter, Noircarmes ordered\r\na battery to be constructed, consisting at first of ten, afterwards of\r\ntwenty, heavy guns and mortars, besides some lighter pieces. From this\r\nbattery he opened a well-directed and most disastrous fire on the city,\r\ndemolishing some of the principal edifices, which, from their size,\r\nafforded a prominent mark. The great tower of St. Nicholas, on which\r\nsome heavy ordnance was planted, soon crumbled, under this fierce\r\ncannonade, and its defenders were buried in its ruins. At length, at the\r\nend of four hours, the inhabitants, unable longer to endure the storm of\r\nshot and shells which penetrated every quarter of the town, so far\r\nhumbled their pride as to request a parley. To this Noircarmes assented,\r\nbut without intermitting his fire for a moment.\r\n\r\nThe deputies informed the general, that the city was willing to\r\ncapitulate on the terms before proposed by the Flemish nobles. But\r\nNoircarmes contemptuously told them that \"things were not now as they\r\nthen were, and it was not his wont to talk of terms with a fallen\r\nenemy.\"[881] The deputies, greatly discomfited by the reply, returned to\r\nreport the failure of their mission to their townsmen.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the iron tempest continued with pitiless fury. The wretched\r\npeople could find no refuge from it in their dwellings, which filled the\r\nstreets with their ruins. It was not, however, till two-and-thirty hours\r\nmore had passed away that a practicable breach was made in the walls;\r\nwhile the rubbish which had tumbled into the fosse from the crumbling\r\nramparts afforded a tolerable passage for the besiegers, on a level\r\nnearly with the breach itself. By this passage Noircarmes now prepared\r\nto march into the city, through the open breach, at the head of his\r\nbattalions.\r\n\r\nThe people of Valenciennes too late awoke from their delusion. They were\r\nno longer cheered by the voice of their fanatical leader, for he had\r\nprovided for his own safety by flight; and, preferring any fate to that\r\nof being delivered over to the ruthless soldiery of Noircarmes, they\r\noffered at once to surrender the town at discretion, throwing themselves\r\non the mercy of their victor. Six-and-thirty hours only had elapsed\r\nsince the batteries of the besiegers had opened their fire, and during\r\nthat time three thousand bombs had been thrown into the city;[882] which\r\nwas thought scarcely less than a miracle in that day.\r\n\r\nOn the second of April, 1567, just four months after the commencement of\r\nthe siege, the victorious army marched into Valenciennes. As it defiled\r\nthrough the long and narrow streets, which showed signs of the dismal\r\nfray in their shattered edifices, and in the dead and dying still\r\nstretched on the pavement, it was met by troops of women and young\r\nmaidens bearing green branches in their hands, and deprecating with\r\ntears and piteous lamentations the wrath of the conquerors. Noircarmes\r\nmarched at once to the town-house, where he speedily relieved the\r\nmunicipal functionaries of all responsibility, by turning them out of\r\noffice. His next care was to seize the persons of the zealous ministers\r\nand the other leaders. Many had already contrived to make their escape.\r\nMost of these were soon after taken, the preacher La Grange among the\r\nrest, and to the number of thirty-six were sentenced either to the\r\nscaffold or the gallows.[883] The general then caused the citizens to be\r\ndisarmed, and the fortifications, on which were mounted eighty pieces of\r\nartillery, to be dismantled. The town was deprived of its privileges and\r\nimmunities, and a heavy fine imposed on the inhabitants to defray the\r\ncharges of the war. The Protestant worship was abolished, the churches\r\nwere restored to their former occupants, and none but the Roman Catholic\r\nservice was allowed henceforth to be performed in the city. The bishop\r\nof Arras was invited to watch over the spiritual concerns of the\r\ninhabitants, and a strong garrison of eight battalions was quartered in\r\nthe place, to secure order and maintain the authority of the cr\r\nown.[884]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OATH IMPOSED BY MARGARET.]\r\n\r\nThe keys of Valenciennes, it was commonly said, opened to the regent the\r\ngates of all the refractory cities of the Netherlands. Maestricht,\r\nTornhut, Ghent, Ypres, Oudenarde, and other places which had refused to\r\nadmit a garrison within their walls, now surrendered, one after\r\nanother, to Margaret, and consented to receive her terms. In like manner\r\nMegen established the royal authority in the province of Gueldres, and\r\nAremberg, after a more prolonged resistance, in Gröningen and Friesland.\r\nIn a few weeks, with the exception of Antwerp and some places in\r\nHolland, the victorious arms of the regent had subdued the spirit of\r\nresistance in every part of the country.[885] The movement of the\r\ninsurgents had been premature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTRANQUILLITY RESTORED.\r\n\r\nOath imposed by Margaret.--Refused by Orange.--He leaves the\r\nNetherlands.--Submission of the Country.--New Edict.--Order restored.\r\n\r\n1567.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe perplexities in which the regent had been involved had led her to\r\nconceive a plan, early in January, 1567, the idea of which may have been\r\nsuggested by the similar plan of Viglius. This was to require an oath\r\nfrom the great nobles, the knights of the Golden Fleece, and those in\r\nhigh stations, civil or military, that they would yield implicit and\r\nunqualified obedience to the commands of the king, of whatever nature\r\nthey might be. Her object in this measure was not to secure a test of\r\nloyalty. She knew full well who were the friends and who were the foes\r\nof the government. But she wished a decent apology for ridding herself\r\nof the latter; and it was made a condition, that those who refused to\r\ntake the oath were to be dismissed from office.\r\n\r\nThe measure seems to have met with no opposition when first started in\r\nthe council; where Mansfeldt, Arschot, Megen, Barlaimont, all signified\r\ntheir readiness to sign the oath. Egmont indeed raised some scruples.\r\nAfter the oath of allegiance he had once taken, a new one seemed\r\nsuperfluous. The bare word of a man of honor and a chevalier of the\r\nToison ought to suffice.[886] But after a short correspondence on the\r\nsubject, his scruples vanished before the arguments or persuasions of\r\nthe regent.\r\n\r\nBrederode, who held a military command, was not of so accommodating a\r\ntemper. He indignantly exclaimed, that it was a base trick of the\r\ngovernment, and he understood the drift of it. He refused to subscribe\r\nthe oath, and at once threw up his commission. The Counts Hoorne and\r\nHoogstraten declined also, but in more temperate terms, and resigning\r\ntheir employments, withdrew to their estates in the country.\r\n\r\nThe person of most importance was the prince of Orange; and it was\r\nnecessary to approach him with the greatest caution. Margaret, it is\r\ntrue, had long since withdrawn from him her confidence. But he had too\r\nmuch consideration and authority in the country for her to wish to break\r\nwith him. Nor would she willingly give him cause of disgust. She\r\naccordingly addressed him a note, couched in the most insinuating terms\r\nshe had at her command.\r\n\r\nShe could not doubt he would be ready to set a good example, when his\r\nexample would be so important in the perplexed condition of the country.\r\nRumors had been circulated to the prejudice of his loyalty. She did not\r\ngive them credit. She could not for a moment believe that he would so\r\nfar dishonor his great name and his illustrious descent as to deserve\r\nsuch a reproach; and she had no doubt he would gladly avail himself of\r\nthe present occasion to wipe away all suspicion.[887]\r\n\r\nThe despatch inclosed a form of the oath, by which the party was to bind\r\nhimself to \"serve the king, and act for or against whomever his majesty\r\nmight command, without restriction or limitation,\"[888] on pain of being\r\ndismissed from office.\r\n\r\nWilliam was not long in replying to a requisition, to obey which would\r\nleave him less freedom than might be claimed by the meanest peasant in\r\nthe country. On the twenty-eighth of April, the same day on which he\r\nreceived the letter, he wrote to the regent, declining in the most\r\npositive terms to take the oath. Such an act, he said, would of itself\r\nimply that he had already violated the oath he had previously taken. Nor\r\ncould he honorably take it, since it might bind him to do what would be\r\ncontrary to the dictates of his own conscience, as well as to what he\r\nconceived to be the true interests of his majesty and the country.[889]\r\nHe was aware that such a demand on the regent's part was equivalent to a\r\ndismissal from office. He begged her, therefore, to send some one fully\r\nempowered to receive his commissions, since he was ready forthwith to\r\nsurrender them. As for himself, he should withdraw from the Netherlands,\r\nand wait until his sovereign had time to become satisfied of his\r\nfidelity. But wherever he might be, he should ever be ready to devote\r\nboth life and property to the service of the king and the common weal of\r\nthe country.[890]\r\n\r\nWhatever hesitation the prince of Orange may have before felt as to the\r\ncourse he was to take, it was clear the time had now come for decisive\r\naction. Though the steady advocate of political reform, his policy, as\r\nwe have seen, had been to attempt this by constitutional methods, not by\r\nviolence. But all his more moderate plans had been overthrown by the\r\nexplosion of the iconoclasts. The outrages then perpetrated had both\r\nalienated the Catholics and disgusted the more moderate portion of the\r\nProtestants; while the divisions of the Protestants among themselves had\r\nso far paralyzed their action, that the whole strength of the party of\r\nreform had never been fairly exerted in the conflict. That conflict,\r\nunprepared as the nation was for it, had been most disastrous.\r\nEverywhere the arms of the regent had been victorious. It was evident\r\nthe hour for resistance had not yet come.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OATH REFUSED BY ORANGE.]\r\n\r\nYet for William to remain in his present position was hazardous in the\r\nextreme. Rumors had gone abroad that the duke of Alva would soon be in\r\nthe Netherlands, at the head of a force sufficient to put down all\r\nopposition. \"Beware of Alva,\" said his wife's kinsman, the landgrave of\r\nHesse, to William; \"I know him well.\"[891] The prince of Orange also\r\nknew him well,--too well to trust him. He knew the hard, inexorable\r\nnature of the man who was now coming with an army at his back, and\r\nclothed with the twofold authority of judge and executioner. The first\r\nblow would, he knew, be aimed at the highest mark. To await Alva's\r\ncoming would be to provoke his fate. Yet the prince felt all the\r\ndreariness of his situation. \"I am alone,\" he wrote to the Landgrave\r\nWilliam of Hesse, \"with dangers menacing me on all sides, yet without\r\none trusty friend to whom I can open my heart.\"[892]\r\n\r\nMargaret seems to have been less prepared than might have been expected\r\nfor the decision of Orange. Yet she determined not to let him depart\r\nfrom the country without an effort to retain him. She accordingly sent\r\nher secretary, Berty, to the prince at Antwerp, to enter into the matter\r\nmore freely, and, if possible, prevail on him to review the grounds of\r\nhis decision. William freely, and at some length, stated his reasons for\r\ndeclining the oath. \"If I thus blindly surrender myself to the will of\r\nthe king, I may be driven to do what is most repugnant to my principles,\r\nespecially in the stern mode of dealing with the sectaries. I may be\r\ncompelled to denounce some of my own family, even my wife, as Lutherans,\r\nand to deliver them into the hands of the executioner. Finally,\" said\r\nhe, \"the king may send some one in his royal name to rule over us, to\r\nwhom it would be derogatory for me to submit.\" The name of \"Alva\"\r\nescaped, as if involuntarily, from his lips,--and he was silent.[893]\r\n\r\nBerty endeavored to answer the objections of the prince, but the latter,\r\ninterrupting him before he had touched on the duke of Alva, bluntly\r\ndeclared that the king would never be content while one of his great\r\nvassals was wedded to a heretic. It was his purpose, therefore, to leave\r\nthe country at once, and retire to Germany; and with this remark he\r\nabruptly closed the conference.\r\n\r\nThe secretary, though mortified at his own failure, besought William to\r\nconsent to an interview, before his departure, with Count Egmont, who,\r\nBerty trusted, might be more successful. To this William readily\r\nassented. This celebrated meeting took place at Willbroek, a village\r\nbetween Antwerp and Brussels. Besides the two lords there were only\r\npresent Count Mansfeldt and the secretary.\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion, in which each of the friends endeavored to win\r\nover the other to his own way of thinking, William expressed the hope\r\nthat Egmont would save himself in time from the bloody tempest that, he\r\npredicted, was soon to fall on the heads of the Flemish nobles.[894] \"I\r\ntrust in the clemency of my sovereign,\" answered the count; \"he cannot\r\ndeal harshly with men who have restored order to the country.\" \"This\r\nclemency you so extol,\" replied William, \"will be your ruin. Much I fear\r\nthat the Spaniards will make use of you as a bridge to effect their\r\nentrance into the country!\"[895] With this ominous prediction on his\r\nlips, he tenderly embraced the count, with tears in his eyes, bidding\r\nhim a last farewell. And thus the two friends parted, like men who were\r\nnever to meet again.\r\n\r\nThe different courses pursued by the two nobles were such as might be\r\nexpected from the difference of both their characters and their\r\ncircumstances. Egmont, ardent, hopeful, and confiding, easily\r\nsurrendered himself to the illusions of his own fancy, as if events were\r\nto shape themselves according to his wishes. He had not the far-seeing\r\neye of William, which seemed to penetrate into events as it did into\r\ncharacters. Nor had Egmont learned, like William, not to put his trust\r\nin princes. He was, doubtless, as sincerely attached to his country as\r\nthe prince of Orange, and abhorred, like him, the system of persecution\r\navowed by the government. But this persecution fell upon a party with\r\nwhom he had little sympathy. William, on the other hand, was a member of\r\nthat party. A blow aimed at them was aimed also at him. It is easy to\r\nsee how different were the stakes of the two nobles in the coming\r\ncontest, both in respect to their sympathies and their interests. Egmont\r\nwas by birth a Fleming. His estates were in Flanders, and there, too,\r\nwere his hopes of worldly fortune. Exile to him would have been beggary\r\nand ruin. But a large, if not the larger part of William's property, lay\r\nwithout the confines of the Netherlands. In withdrawing to Germany, he\r\nwent to his native land. His kindred were still there. With them he had\r\nmaintained a constant correspondence, and there he would be welcomed by\r\ntroops of friends. It was a home, and no place of exile, that William\r\nwas to find in Germany.\r\n\r\nShortly after this interview, the prince went to his estates at Breda,\r\nthere to remain a few days before quitting the country.[896] From Breda\r\nhe wrote to Egmont, expressing the hope that, when he had weighed them\r\nin his mind, he would be contented with the reasons assigned for his\r\ndeparture. The rest he would leave to God, who would order all for his\r\nown glory. \"Be sure,\" he added, \"you have no friend more warmly devoted\r\nto you than myself; for the love of you is too deeply rooted in my heart\r\nto be weakened either by time or distance.\"[897] It is pleasing to see\r\nthat party spirit had not, as in the case of more vulgar souls, the\r\npower to rend asunder the ties which had so long bound these great men\r\nto each other; to see them still turning back, with looks of accustomed\r\nkindness, when they were entering the paths that were to lead in such\r\nopposite directions.\r\n\r\nWilliam wrote also to the king, acquainting him with what he had done,\r\nand explaining the grounds of it; at the same time renewing the\r\ndeclaration that, wherever he might be, he trusted never to be found\r\nwanting to the obligations of a true and faithful vassal. Before leaving\r\nBreda, the prince received a letter from the politic regent, more\r\namiable in its import than might have been expected. Perhaps it was not\r\nwholly policy that made her unwilling to part with him in anger. She\r\nexpressed her readiness to do him any favor in her power. She had always\r\nfelt for him, she said, the same affection as for her own son, and\r\nshould ever continue to do so.[898]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WILLIAM LEAVES THE NETHERLANDS.]\r\n\r\nOn the last of April, William departed for Germany. He took with him all\r\nhis household except his eldest son, the count of Buren, then a boy\r\nthirteen years old, who was pursuing his studies at the university of\r\nLouvain.[899] Perhaps William trusted to the immunities of Brabant, or\r\nto the tender age of the youth, for his protection. If so, he grievously\r\nmiscalculated. The boy would serve as too important a hostage for his\r\nfather, and Philip caused him to be transferred to Madrid; where, under\r\nthe monarch's eye, he was educated in religious as well as in political\r\nsentiments very little in harmony with those of the prince of Orange.\r\nFortunately, the younger brother, Maurice, who inherited the genius of\r\nhis father, and was to carry down his great name to another generation,\r\nwas allowed to receive his training under the paternal roof.[900]\r\n\r\nBesides his family, William was accompanied by a host of friends and\r\nfollowers, some of them persons of high consideration, who preferred\r\nbanishment with him to encountering the troubles that awaited them at\r\nhome. Thus attended, he fixed his residence at Dillemburg, in Nassau,\r\nthe seat of his ancestors, and the place of his own birth. He there\r\noccupied himself with studying the Lutheran doctrine under an\r\nexperienced teacher of that persuasion;[901] and, while he kept a\r\nwatchful eye on the events passing in his unhappy country, he endeavored\r\nto make himself acquainted with the principles of that glorious\r\nReformation, of which, in connection with political freedom, he was one\r\nday to become the champion.\r\n\r\nThe departure of the prince of Orange caused general consternation in\r\nthe Netherlands. All who were in anyway compromised by the late\r\ndisturbances watched more anxiously than ever the signs of the coming\r\ntempest, as they felt they had lost the pilot who alone could enable\r\nthem to weather it. Thousands prepared to imitate his example by\r\nquitting the country before it was too late. Among those who fled were\r\nthe Counts Culemborg, Berg, Hoogstraten, Louis of Nassau, and others of\r\ninferior note, who passed into Germany, where they gathered into a\r\nlittle circle round the prince, waiting, like him, for happier days.\r\n\r\nSome of the great lords, who had held out against the regent, now left\r\nalone, intimated their willingness to comply with her demands. \"Count\r\nHoorne,\" she writes to Philip, \"has offered his services to me, and\r\ndeclares his readiness to take the oath. If he has spoken too freely, he\r\nsays, it was not from any disaffection to the government, but from a\r\nmomentary feeling of pique and irritation. I would not drive him to\r\ndesperation, and from regard to his kindred I have consented that he\r\nshould take his seat in the council again.\"[902] The haughty tone of\r\nthe duchess shows that she felt herself now so strongly seated as to be\r\nnearly indifferent whether the person she dealt with were friend or\r\nfoe.[903]\r\n\r\nEgmont, at this time, was endeavoring to make amends for the past by\r\nsuch extraordinary demonstrations of loyalty as should efface all\r\nremembrance of it. He rode through the land at the head of his troops,\r\nbreaking up the consistories, arresting the rioters, and everywhere\r\nreëstablishing the Catholic worship. He loudly declared that those who\r\nwould remain his friends must give unequivocal proofs of loyalty to the\r\ncrown and the Roman Catholic faith. Some of those with whom he had been\r\nmost intimate, disgusted with, this course, and distrusting, perhaps,\r\nsuch a deposit for their correspondence, sent back the letters they had\r\nreceived from him, and demanded their own in return.[904]\r\n\r\nAt Brussels Egmont entered into all the gayeties of the court,\r\ndisplaying his usual magnificence in costly fêtes and banquets, which\r\nthe duchess of Parma sometimes honored with her presence. The count's\r\nname appears among those which she mentions to Philip as of persons well\r\naffected to the government. \"It is impossible,\" she says, \"not to be\r\nsatisfied with his conduct.\"[905] Thus elated by the favor of the\r\nregent--next in importance to that of royalty itself--the ill-fated\r\nnobleman cherished the fond hope that the past would now be completely\r\neffaced from the memory of his master,--a master who might forget a\r\nbenefit, but who was never known to forgive an injury.\r\n\r\nThe great towns throughout the land had now generally intimated their\r\nwillingness to submit to the requisitions of Margaret, and many of them\r\nhad admitted garrisons within their walls. Antwerp only, of the cities\r\nof Brabant, remained intractable. At length it yielded to the general\r\nimpulse, and a deputation was sent to the regent to sue for her\r\nforgiveness, and to promise that the leaders in the late disturbances\r\nshould be banished from the city. This was a real triumph to the royal\r\nparty, considering the motley character of the population, in which\r\nthere was so large an infusion of Calvinism. But Margaret, far from\r\nshowing her satisfaction, coolly answered that they must first receive a\r\ngarrison; then she would intercede for them with the king, and would\r\nherself consent to take up her residence in the city. In this the\r\ninhabitants, now well humbled, affected willingly to acquiesce; and soon\r\nafter Count Mansfeldt, at the head of sixteen companies of foot, marched\r\ninto Antwerp in battle array, and there quartered his soldiers as in a\r\nconquered capital.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NEW EDICT.]\r\n\r\nA day was fixed for the regent's entry, which was to be made with all\r\nbecoming pomp. Detachments of troops were stationed in the principal\r\navenues, and on the thirtieth of April Margaret rode into Antwerp,\r\nescorted by twelve hundred Walloons, and accompanied by the knights of\r\nthe Golden Fleece, the great lords, and the provincial magistrates. As\r\nthe glittering procession passed through the files of the soldiery,\r\nalong the principal streets, it was greeted with the huzzas of the\r\nfickle populace. Thus cheered on her way, the regent proceeded first to\r\nthe cathedral, where _Te Deum_ was chanted, and on her knees she\r\nreturned thanks to the Almighty, that this great city had been restored\r\nwithout battle or bloodshed to the king and the true faith.[906] As her\r\neyes wandered over the desecrated altars and the walls despoiled of\r\ntheir ornaments, their rich sculpture and paintings, by the rude hand of\r\nviolence, Margaret could not restrain her tears. Her first care was to\r\nrecover, as far as possible, the stolen property, and repair the\r\ninjuries to the building; the next, to punish the authors of these\r\natrocities; and the execution in the market-place of four of the\r\nringleaders proclaimed to the people of Antwerp that the reign of\r\nanarchy was over.\r\n\r\nMargaret next caused the churches of the reformed party to be levelled\r\nwith the ground. Those of the Romish faith, after being purified, and\r\nthe marks of violence, as far as practicable, effaced, were restored to\r\ntheir ancient occupants. The Protestant schools were everywhere closed.\r\nThe children who had been baptized with Protestant rites were now\r\nre-baptized after the Catholic.[907] In fine, the reformed worship was\r\ninterdicted throughout the city, and that of the Romish church, with its\r\nsplendid ritual, was established in its place.\r\n\r\nOn occupying Antwerp, Margaret had allowed all who were not implicated\r\nin the late riots to leave the city with their effects. Great numbers\r\nnow availed themselves of this permission, and the streets presented the\r\nmelancholy spectacle of husbands parting from their wives, parents from\r\ntheir children, or, it might be, taking their families along with them\r\nto some kinder land, where they would be allowed to worship God\r\naccording to the dictates of their own consciences.\r\n\r\nBut even this glimmering of a tolerant spirit,--if so it can be\r\ncalled,--which Margaret exhibited at the outset, soon faded away before\r\nthe dark spirit of the Inquisition. On the twenty-fourth of May, she\r\npublished an edict, written in the characters of blood which\r\ndistinguished the worst times of Charles and of Philip. By this edict,\r\nall who had publicly preached, or who had performed the religions\r\nexercises after the Protestant manner, all who had furnished the places\r\nof meeting, or had harbored or aided the preachers, all printers of\r\nheretical tracts, or artists who with their pencil had brought ridicule\r\non the Church of Rome,--all, in short, who were guilty of these or\r\nsimilar iniquities, were to be punished with death and confiscation of\r\nproperty. Lighter offences were to be dealt with according to the\r\nmeasure of their guilt. The edict containing these humane provisions is\r\nof considerable length, and goes into a large specification of offences,\r\nfrom which few, if any, of the reformed could have been entirely\r\nexempt.[908] When this ordinance of the regent was known at Madrid, it\r\ncaused great dissatisfaction. The king pronounced it \"indecorous,\r\nillegal, and altogether repugnant to the true spirit of\r\nChristianity;\"[909] and he ordered Margaret forthwith to revoke the\r\nedict. It was accordingly repealed on the twenty-third of July\r\nfollowing. The reader who may be disposed to join heartily in the\r\nmalediction may not be prepared to learn that the cause of the royal\r\nindignation was not that the edict was too severe, but that it was too\r\nlenient! It nowhere denounced the right of private worship. A man might\r\nstill be a heretic at heart and at his own fireside, so long as he did\r\nnot obtrude it on the public. This did not suit the Inquisition, whose\r\njealous eye penetrated into the houses and the hearts of men, dragging\r\nforth their secret thoughts into open day, and punishing these like\r\novert acts. Margaret had something yet to learn in the school of\r\npersecution.[910]\r\n\r\nWhile at Antwerp, the regent received an embassy from the elector of\r\nSaxony, the landgrave of Hesse, and other Protestant princes of Germany,\r\ninterceding for the oppressed Lutherans, and praying that she would not\r\nconsent to their being so grievously vexed by the Catholic government.\r\nMargaret, who was as little pleased with the plain terms in which this\r\nremonstrance was conveyed as with the object of it, coldly replied, that\r\nthe late conduct of the Flemish Protestants doubtless entitled them to\r\nall this sympathy from the German princes; but she advised the latter to\r\nbusy themselves with their own affairs, and leave the king of Spain to\r\nmanage his as he thought best.[911]\r\n\r\nOf all the provinces, Holland was the only one which still made\r\nresistance to the will of the regent. And here, as we have already seen,\r\nwas gathered a military array of some strength. The head-quarters were\r\nat Brederode's town of Viana. But that chief had left his followers for\r\nthe present, and had been secretly introduced into Amsterdam, where, as\r\nbefore noticed, he was busy in rousing a spirit of resistance in the\r\ncitizens, already well prepared for it by their Protestant preachers.\r\nThe magistrates, sorely annoyed, would gladly have rid themselves of\r\nBrederode's presence, but he had too strong a hold on the people. Yet,\r\nas hour after hour brought fresh tidings of the disasters of his party,\r\nthe chief himself became aware that all hopes of successful resistance\r\nmust be deferred to another day. Quitting the city by night, he\r\ncontrived, with the aid of his friends, to make his escape into Germany.\r\nSome months he passed in Westphalia, occupied with raising forces for a\r\nmeditated invasion of the Netherlands, when, in the summer of 1568, he\r\nwas carried off by a fever, brought on, it is said, by his careless,\r\nintemperate way of life.[912]\r\n\r\nBrederode was a person of a free and fearless temper,--with the defects,\r\nand the merits too, that attach to that sort of character. The\r\nfriendship with which he seems to have been regarded by some of the most\r\nestimable persons of his party--Louis of Nassau, especially--speaks well\r\nfor his heart. The reckless audacity of the man is shown in his\r\ncorrespondence; and the free manner in which he deals with persons and\r\nevents makes his letters no less interesting than important for the\r\nlight they throw on these troubled times. Yet it cannot be denied that,\r\nafter all, Brederode is indebted much more to the circumstances of his\r\nsituation than to his own character for the space he occupies in the\r\npages of history.[913]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CRUEL REPRISALS.]\r\n\r\nThus left without a leader, the little army which Brederode had gathered\r\nunder his banner soon fell to pieces. Detachments, scattering over the\r\ncountry, committed various depredations, plundering the religious houses\r\nand engaging in encounters with the royal troops under Megen and\r\nAremberg, in which the insurgents fared the worst. Thus broken on all\r\nsides, those who did not fall into the enemy's hands, or on the field,\r\nwere too glad to make their escape into Germany. One vessel, containing\r\na great number of fugitives, was wrecked, and all on board were made\r\nprisoners. Among them were two brothers, of the name of Battenberg; they\r\nwere of a noble family, and prominent members of the league. They were\r\nat once, with their principal followers, thrown into prison, to await\r\ntheir doom from the bloody tribunal of Alva.\r\n\r\nDeprived of all support from without, the city of Amsterdam offered no\r\nfurther resistance, but threw open its gates to the regent, and\r\nconsented to accept her terms. These were the same that had been imposed\r\non all the other refractory towns. The immunities of the city were\r\ndeclared to be forfeited, a garrison was marched into the place, and\r\npreparations were made for building a fortress, to guard against future\r\ncommotions. Those who chose--with the customary exceptions--were allowed\r\nto leave the city. Great numbers availed themselves of the permission.\r\nThe neighboring dikes were crowded with fugitives from the territory\r\naround, as well as from the city, anxiously waiting for vessels to\r\ntransport them to Embden, the chief asylum of the exiles. There they\r\nstood, men, women, and children, a melancholy throng, without food,\r\nalmost without raiment or any of the common necessaries of life,\r\nexciting the commiseration of even their Catholic adversaries.[914]\r\n\r\nThe example of Amsterdam was speedily followed by Delft, Haarlem,\r\nRotterdam, Leyden, and the remaining towns of Holland, which now seemed\r\nto vie with one another in demonstrations of loyalty to the government.\r\nThe triumph of the regent was complete. Her arms had been everywhere\r\nsuccessful, and her authority was fully recognized throughout the whole\r\nextent of the Netherlands. Doubtful friends and open foes, Catholics and\r\nReformers, were alike prostrate at her feet.[915] With the hour of\r\ntriumph came also the hour of vengeance. And we can hardly doubt that\r\nthe remembrance of past humiliation gave a sharper edge to the sword of\r\njustice. Fortresses, to overawe the inhabitants, were raised in the\r\nprincipal towns;[916] and the expense of their construction, as well as\r\nof maintaining their garrison, was defrayed by fines laid on the\r\nrefractory cities.[917] The regent's troops rode over the country, and\r\nwherever the reformed were gathered to hear the word, they were charged\r\nby the troopers, who trampled them under their horses' hoofs, shooting\r\nthem down without mercy, or dragging them off by scores to execution. No\r\ntown was so small that fifty at least did not perish in this way, while\r\nthe number of the victims sometimes rose to two or even three\r\nhundred.[918] Everywhere along the road-side the traveller beheld the\r\nghastly spectacle of bodies swinging from gibbets, or met with troops of\r\nmiserable exiles flying from their native land.[919] Confiscation\r\nfollowed, as usual, in the train of persecution. At Tournay, the\r\nproperty of a hundred of the richest merchants was seized and\r\nappropriated by the government. Even the populace, like those animals\r\nwho fall upon and devour one of their own number when wounded, now\r\njoined in the cry against the Reformers. They worked with the same\r\nalacrity as the soldiers in pulling down the Protestant churches; and\r\nfrom the beams, in some instances, formed the very gallows from which\r\ntheir unhappy victims were suspended.[920] Such is the picture, well\r\ncharged with horrors, left to us by Protestant writers. We may be quite\r\nsure that it lost nothing of its darker coloring under their hands.\r\n\r\nSo strong was now the tide of emigration, that it threatened to\r\ndepopulate some of the fairest provinces of the country. The regent, who\r\nat first rejoiced in this as the best means of ridding the land of its\r\nenemies, became alarmed, as she saw it was drawing off so large a\r\nportion of the industrious population. They fled to France, to Germany,\r\nand very many to England, where the wise Elizabeth provided them with\r\nhomes, knowing well that, though poor, they brought with them a skill in\r\nthe mechanic arts which would do more than gold and silver for the\r\nprosperity of her kingdom.\r\n\r\nMargaret would have stayed this tide of emigration by promises of grace,\r\nif not by a general amnesty for the past. But though she had power to\r\npunish, Philip had not given her the power to pardon. And indeed\r\npromises of grace would have availed little with men flying from the\r\ndread presence of Alva.[921] It was the fear of him which gave wings to\r\ntheir flight, as Margaret herself plainly intimated in a letter to the\r\nduke, in which she deprecated his coming with an army, when nothing more\r\nwas needed than a vigilant police.[922]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TRANQUILLITY RESTORED.]\r\n\r\nIn truth, Margaret was greatly disgusted by the intended mission of the\r\nduke of Alva, of which she had been advised by the king some months\r\nbefore. She knew well the imperious temper of the man, and that, however\r\nhigh-sounding might be her own titles, the power would be lodged in his\r\nhands. She felt this to be a poor requital for her past services,--a\r\npersonal indignity, no less than an injury to the state. She gave free\r\nvent to her feelings on the subject in more than one letter to her\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nIn a letter of the fifth of April she says: \"You have shown no regard\r\nfor my wishes or my reputation. By your extraordinary restrictions on my\r\nauthority, you have prevented my settling the affairs of the country\r\nentirely to my mind. Yet, seeing things in so good a state, you are\r\nwilling to give all the credit to another, and leave me only the fatigue\r\nand danger.[923] But I am resolved, instead of wasting the remainder of\r\nmy days, as I have already done my health, in this way, to retire and\r\ndedicate myself to a tranquil life in the service of God.\" In another\r\nletter, dated four weeks later, on the third of May, after complaining\r\nthat the king withdraws his confidence more and more from her, she asks\r\nleave to withdraw, as the country is restored to order, and the royal\r\nauthority more assured than in the time of Charles the Fifth.[924]\r\n\r\nIn this assurance respecting the public tranquillity, Margaret was no\r\ndoubt sincere; as are also the historians who have continued to take the\r\nsame view of the matter, down to the present time, and who consider the\r\ntroubles of the country to have been so far composed by the regent,\r\nthat, but for the coming of Alva, there would have been no revolution in\r\nthe Netherlands. Indeed, there might have seemed to be good ground for\r\nsuch a conclusion. The revolt had been crushed. Resistance had\r\neverywhere ceased. The authority of the regent was recognized throughout\r\nthe land. The league, which had raised so bold a front against the\r\ngovernment, had crumbled away. Its members had fallen in battle, or lay\r\nwaiting their sentence in dungeons, or were wandering as miserable\r\nexiles in distant lands. The name of _Gueux_, and the insignia of the\r\nbowl and the beggar's scrip, which they had assumed in derision, were\r\nnow theirs by right. It was too true for a jest.\r\n\r\nThe party of reform had disappeared, as if by magic. Its worship was\r\neverywhere proscribed. On its ruins the Catholic religion had risen in\r\ngreater splendor than ever. Its temples were restored, its services\r\ncelebrated with more than customary pomp. The more austere and\r\nuncompromising of the Reformers had fled the country. Those who remained\r\npurchased impunity by a compulsory attendance on mass; or the wealthier\r\nsort, by the aid of good cheer or more substantial largesses, bribed the\r\npriest to silence.[925] At no time since the beginning of the\r\nReformation had the clergy been treated with greater deference, or\r\nenjoyed a greater share of authority in the land. The dark hour of\r\nrevolution seemed, indeed, to have passed away.\r\n\r\nYet a Fleming of that day might well doubt whether the prince of Orange\r\nwere a man likely to resign his fair heritage and the land so dear to\r\nhis heart without striking one blow in their defence. One who knew the\r\nwide spread of the principles of reform, and the sturdy character of the\r\nreformer, might distrust the permanence of a quiet which had been\r\nbrought about by so much violence. He might rather think that, beneath\r\nthe soil he was treading, the elements were still at work, which, at no\r\ndistant time perhaps, would burst forth with redoubled violence, and\r\nspread ruin over the land!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nALVA SENT TO THE NETHERLANDS.\r\n\r\nAlva's Appointment.--His remarkable March.--He arrives at\r\nBrussels.--Margaret disgusted.--Policy of the Duke.--Arrest of Egmont\r\nand Hoorne.\r\n\r\n1567.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Margaret was thus successful in bringing the country to a state of\r\nat least temporary tranquillity, measures were taken at the court of\r\nMadrid for shifting the government of the Netherlands into other hands,\r\nand for materially changing its policy.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how actively the rumors had been circulated, throughout the\r\nlast year, of Philip's intended visit to the country. These rumors had\r\nreceived abundant warrant from his own letters, addressed to the regent\r\nand to his ministers at the different European courts. Nor did the king\r\nconfine himself to professions. He applied to the French government to\r\nallow a free passage for his army through its territories. He caused a\r\nsurvey to be made of that part of Savoy through which his troops would\r\nprobably march, and a map of the proposed route to be prepared. He\r\nordered fresh levies from Germany to meet him on the Flemish frontier.\r\nAnd finally, he talked of calling the cortes together, to provide for\r\nthe regency during his absence.\r\n\r\nYet whoever else might be imposed on, there was one potentate in Europe\r\nwhose clear vision was not to be blinded by the professions of Philip,\r\nnor by all this bustle of preparation. This was the old pontiff, Pius\r\nthe Fifth, who had always distrusted the king's sincerity. Pius had\r\nbeheld with keen anguish the spread of heresy in the Low Countries. Like\r\na true son of the Inquisition as he was, he would gladly have seen its\r\nfires kindled in every city of this apostate land. He had observed with\r\nvexation the apathy manifested by Philip. And he at length resolved to\r\ndespatch a special embassy to Spain, to stimulate the monarch, if\r\npossible, to more decided action.\r\n\r\nThe person employed was the bishop of Ascoli, and the good father\r\ndelivered his rebuke in such blunt terms as caused a sensation at the\r\ncourt of Madrid. In a letter to his ambassador at Rome, Philip\r\ncomplained that the pope should have thus held him up to Christendom as\r\none slack in the performance of his duty. The envoy had delivered\r\nhimself in so strange a manner, Philip added, that, but for the respect\r\nand love he bore his holiness, he might have been led to take precisely\r\nthe opposite course to the one he intended.[926]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS APPOINTMENT.]\r\n\r\nYet notwithstanding this show of indignation, had it not been for the\r\noutbreak of the iconoclasts, it is not improbable that the king might\r\nstill have continued to procrastinate, relying on his favorite maxim,\r\nthat \"Time and himself were a match for any other two.\"[927] But the\r\nevent which caused such a sensation throughout Christendom roused every\r\nfeeling of indignation in the royal bosom,--and this from the insult\r\noffered to the crown as well as to the Church. Contrary to his wont, the\r\nking expressed himself with so much warmth on the subject, and so\r\nopenly, that the most sceptical began at last to believe that the long\r\ntalked of visit was at hand. The only doubt was as to the manner in\r\nwhich it should be made; whether the king should march at the head of an\r\narmy, or attended only by so much of a retinue as was demanded by his\r\nroyal state.\r\n\r\nThe question was warmly discussed in the council. Ruy Gomez, the courtly\r\nfavorite of Philip, was for the latter alternative. A civil war he\r\ndeprecated, as bringing ruin even to the victor.[928] Clemency was the\r\nbest attribute of a sovereign, and the people of Flanders were a\r\ngenerous race, more likely to be overcome by kindness than by arms.[929]\r\nIn these liberal and humane views the prince of Eboli was supported by\r\nthe politic secretary, Antonio Perez, and by the duke of Feria, formerly\r\nambassador to London, a man who to polished manners united a most\r\ninsinuating eloquence.\r\n\r\nBut very different opinions, as might be expected, were advanced by the\r\nduke of Alva. The system of indulgence, he said, had been that followed\r\nby the regent, and its fruits were visible. The weeds of heresy were not\r\nto be extirpated by a gentle hand; and his majesty should deal with his\r\nrebellious vassals as Charles the Fifth had dealt with their rebel\r\nfathers at Ghent.[930] These stern views received support from the\r\nCardinal Espinosa, who held the office of president of the council, as\r\nwell as of grand inquisitor, and who doubtless thought the insult\r\noffered to the Inquisition not the least of the offences to be charged\r\non the Reformers.\r\n\r\nEach of the great leaders recommended the measures most congenial with\r\nhis own character, and which, had they been adopted, would probably\r\nhave required his own services to carry them into execution. Had the\r\npacific course been taken, Feria, or more probably Ruy Gomez, would have\r\nbeen intrusted with the direction of affairs. Indeed, Montigny and\r\nBergen, still detained in reluctant captivity at Madrid, strongly urged\r\nthe king to send the prince of Eboli, as a man, who, by his popular\r\nmanners and known discretion, would be most likely to reconcile opposite\r\nfactions.[931] Were violent measures, on the other hand, to be adopted,\r\nto whom could they be so well intrusted as to the duke himself, the most\r\nexperienced captain of his time?\r\n\r\nThe king, it is said, contrary to his custom, was present at the meeting\r\nof the council, and listened to the debate. He did not intimate his\r\nopinion. But it might be conjectured to which side he was most likely to\r\nlean, from his habitual preference for coercive measures.[932]\r\n\r\nPhilip came to a decision sooner than usual. In a few days he summoned\r\nthe duke, and told him that he had resolved to send him forthwith, at\r\nthe head of an army, to the Netherlands. It was only, however, to\r\nprepare the way for his own coming, which would take place as soon as\r\nthe country was in a state sufficiently settled to receive him.\r\n\r\nAll was now alive with the business of preparation in Castile. Levies\r\nwere raised throughout the country. Such was the zeal displayed, that\r\neven the Inquisition and the clergy advanced a considerable sum towards\r\ndefraying the expenses of an expedition which they seemed to regard in\r\nthe light of a crusade.[933] Magazines of provisions were ordered to be\r\nestablished at regular stations on the proposed line of march. Orders\r\nwere sent, that the old Spanish garrisons in Lombardy, Naples, Sicily,\r\nand Sardinia, should be transported to the place of rendezvous in\r\nPiedmont, to await the coming of the duke, who would supply their places\r\nwith the fresh recruits brought with him from Castile.\r\n\r\nPhilip meanwhile constantly proclaimed that Alva's departure was only\r\nthe herald of his own. He wrote this to Margaret, assuring her of his\r\npurpose to go by water, and directing her to have a squadron of eight\r\nvessels in readiness to convoy him to Zealand, where he proposed to\r\nland. The vessels were accordingly equipped. Processions were made, and\r\nprayers put up in all the churches, for the prosperous passage of the\r\nking. Yet there were some in the Netherlands who remarked that prayers\r\nto avert the dangers of the sea were hardly needed by the monarch in his\r\npalace at Madrid![934] Many of those about the royal person soon\r\nindulged in the same scepticism in regard to the king's sincerity, as\r\nweek after week passed away, and no arrangements were made for his\r\ndeparture. Among the contradictory rumors at court in respect to the\r\nking's intention, the pope's nuncio wrote, it was impossible to get at\r\nthe truth.[935] It was easy to comprehend the general policy of Philip,\r\nbut impossible to divine the particular plans by which, it was to be\r\ncarried out. If such was the veil which hid the monarch's purposes even\r\nfrom the eyes of those who had nearest access to his person, how can we\r\nhope at this distance of time to penetrate it? Yet the historian of the\r\nnineteenth century is admitted to the perusal of many an authentic\r\ndocument revealing the royal purpose, which never came under the eye of\r\nthe courtier of Madrid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS APPOINTMENT.]\r\n\r\nWith all the light thus afforded, it is still difficult to say whether\r\nPhilip ever was sincere in his professions of visiting the Netherlands.\r\nIf he were so at any time, it certainly was not after he had decided on\r\nthe mission of Alva. Philip widely differed from his father in a\r\nsluggishness of body which made any undertaking that required physical\r\neffort exceedingly irksome. He shrunk from no amount of sedentary labor,\r\nwould toil from morning till midnight in his closet, like the humblest\r\nof his secretaries. But a journey was a great undertaking. After his\r\nvisits, during his father's lifetime, to England and the Low Countries,\r\nhe rarely travelled farther, as his graceless son satirically hinted,\r\nthan from Madrid to Aranjuez, or Madrid to the Escorial. A thing so\r\nformidable as an expedition to Flanders, involving a tedious journey\r\nthrough an unfriendly land, or a voyage through seas not less\r\nunfriendly, was what, under ordinary circumstances, the king would have\r\nnever dreamed of.\r\n\r\nThe present aspect of affairs, moreover, had nothing in it particularly\r\ninviting,--especially to a prince of Philip's temper. Never was there a\r\nprince more jealous of his authority; and the indignities to which he\r\nmight have been exposed, in the disorderly condition of the country,\r\nmight well have come to the aid of his constitutional sluggishness to\r\ndeter him from the visit.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, it is not strange that Philip, if he had ever\r\nentertained a vague project of a journey to the Netherlands, should have\r\nyielded to his natural habit of procrastination. The difficulties of a\r\nwinter's voyage, the necessity of summoning the cortes and settling the\r\naffairs of the kingdom, his own protracted illness, furnished so many\r\napologies for postponing the irksome visit, until the time had passed\r\nwhen such a visit could be effectual.\r\n\r\nThat he should so strenuously have asserted his purpose of going to the\r\nNetherlands may be explained by a desire in some sort to save his credit\r\nwith those who seemed to think that the present exigency demanded he\r\nshould go. He may have also thought it politic to keep up the idea of a\r\nvisit to the Low Countries, in order to curb--as it no doubt had the\r\neffect in some degree of curbing--the licence of the people, who\r\nbelieved they were soon to be called to a reckoning for their misdeeds\r\nby their prince in person. After all, the conduct of Philip on this\r\noccasion, and the motives assigned for his delay in his letters to\r\nMargaret, must be allowed to afford a curious coincidence with those\r\nascribed, in circumstances not dissimilar, by the Roman historian to\r\nTiberius.[936]\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth of April, 1567, Alva had his last audience of Philip at\r\nAranjuez. He immediately after departed for Carthagena, where a fleet of\r\nthirty-six vessels, under the Genoese Admiral Doria, lay riding at\r\nanchor to receive him. He was detained some time for the arrival of the\r\ntroops, and while there he received despatches from court containing his\r\ncommission of captain-general, and particular instructions as to the\r\ncourse he was to pursue in the Netherlands. They were so particular,\r\nthat, notwithstanding the broad extent of his powers, the duke wrote to\r\nhis master complaining of his want of confidence, and declaring that he\r\nhad never been hampered by instructions so minute, even under the\r\nemperor.[937] One who has studied the character of Philip will find no\r\ndifficulty in believing it.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-seventh of April, the fleet weighed anchor; but in\r\nconsequence of a detention of some days at several places on the Catalan\r\ncoast, it did not reach the Genoese port of Savona till the seventeenth\r\nof the next month. The duke had been ill when he went on board; and his\r\ngouty constitution received no benefit from the voyage. Yet he did not\r\ndecline the hospitalities offered by the Genoese nobles, who vied with\r\nthe senate in showing the Spanish commander every testimony of respect.\r\nAt Asti he was waited on by Albuquerque, the Milanese viceroy, and by\r\nambassadors from different Italian provinces, eager to pay homage to the\r\nmilitary representative of the Spanish monarch. But the gout under which\r\nAlva labored was now aggravated by an attack of tertian ague, and for a\r\nweek or more he was confined to his bed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the troops had assembled at the appointed rendezvous; and the\r\nduke, as soon as he had got the better of his disorder, made haste to\r\nreview them. They amounted in all to about ten thousand men, of whom\r\nless than thirteen hundred were cavalry. But though small in amount, it\r\nwas a picked body of troops, such as was hardly to be matched in Europe.\r\nThe infantry, in particular, were mostly Spaniards,--veterans who had\r\nbeen accustomed to victory under the banner of Charles the Fifth, and\r\nmany of them trained to war under the eye of Alva himself. He preferred\r\nsuch a body, compact and well disciplined as it was, to one which,\r\nunwieldy from its size, would have been less fitted for a rapid march\r\nacross the mountains.[938]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS REMARKABLE MARCH.]\r\n\r\nBesides those of the common file, there were many gentlemen and\r\ncavaliers of note, who, weary of repose, came as volunteers to gather\r\nfresh laurels under so renowned a chief as the duke of Alva. Among these\r\nwas Vitelli, marquis of Cetona, a Florentine soldier of high repute in\r\nhis profession, but who, though now embarked in what might be called a\r\nwar of religion, was held so indifferent to religion of any kind, that a\r\nwhimsical epitaph on the sceptic denies him the possession of a\r\nsoul.[939] Another of these volunteers was Mondragone, a veteran of\r\nCharles the Fifth, whose character for chivalrous exploit was unstained\r\nby those deeds of cruelty and rapine which were so often the reproach of\r\nthe cavalier of the sixteenth century. The duties of the commissariat,\r\nparticularly difficult in a campaign like the present, were intrusted to\r\nan experienced Spanish officer named Ibarra. To the duke of Savoy Alva\r\nwas indebted for an eminent engineer named Paciotti, whose services\r\nproved of great importance in the construction of fortresses in the\r\nNetherlands. Alva had also brought with him his two sons, Frederic and\r\nFerdinand de Toledo,--the latter an illegitimate child, for whom the\r\nfather showed as much affection as it was in his rugged nature to feel\r\nfor any one. To Ferdinand was given the command of the cavalry, composed\r\nchiefly of Italians.[940]\r\n\r\nHaving reviewed his forces, the duke formed them into three divisions.\r\nThis he did in order to provide the more easily for their subsistence on\r\nhis long and toilsome journey. The divisions were to be separated from\r\none another by a day's march; so that each would take up at night the\r\nsame quarters which had been occupied by the preceding division on the\r\nnight before. Alva himself led the van.[941]\r\n\r\nHe dispensed with artillery, not willing to embarrass his movements in\r\nhis passage across the mountains. But he employed what was then a\r\nnovelty in war. Each company of foot was flanked by a body of soldiers,\r\ncarrying heavy muskets with rests attached to them. This sort of\r\nfire-arms, from their cumbrous nature, had hitherto been used only in\r\nthe defence of fortresses. But with these portable rests, they were\r\nfound efficient for field service, and as such came into general use\r\nafter this period.[942] Their introduction by Alva may be regarded,\r\ntherefore, as an event of some importance in the history of military\r\nart.\r\n\r\nThe route that Alva proposed to take was that over Mount Cenis, the\r\nsame, according to tradition, by which Hannibal crossed the great\r\nbarrier some eighteen centuries before.[943] If less formidable than in\r\nthe days of the Carthaginian, it was far from being the practicable\r\nroute so easily traversed, whether by trooper or tourist, at the present\r\nday. Steep rocky heights, shaggy with forests, where the snows of winter\r\nstill lingered in the midst of June; fathomless ravines, choked up with\r\nthe _débris_ washed down by the mountain torrent; paths scarcely worn by\r\nthe hunter and his game, affording a precarious footing on the edge of\r\ngiddy precipices; long and intricate defiles, where a handful of men\r\nmight hold an army at bay, and from the surrounding heights roll down\r\nruin on their heads;--these were the obstacles which Alva and his\r\nfollowers had to encounter, as they threaded their toilsome way through\r\na country where the natives bore no friendly disposition to the\r\nSpaniards.\r\n\r\nTheir route lay at no great distance from Geneva, that stronghold of the\r\nReformers; and Pius the Fifth would have persuaded the duke to turn from\r\nhis course, and exterminate this \"nest of devils and\r\napostates,\"[944]--as the Christian father was pleased to term them. The\r\npeople of Geneva, greatly alarmed at the prospect of an invasion,\r\napplied to their Huguenot brethren for aid. The prince of Condé and the\r\nAdmiral Coligni--the leaders of that party--offered their services to\r\nthe French monarch to raise fifty thousand men, fall upon his old\r\nenemies, the Spaniards, and cut them off in the passes of the mountains.\r\nBut Charles the Ninth readily understood the drift of this proposal.\r\nThough he bore little love to the Spaniards, he bore still less to the\r\nReformers. He therefore declined this offer of the Huguenot chiefs,\r\nadding that he was able to protect France without their assistance.[945]\r\nThe Genevans were accordingly obliged to stand to their own defence,\r\nthough they gathered confidence from the promised support of their\r\ncountrymen of Berne; and the whole array of these brave mountaineers was\r\nin arms, ready to repel any assault of the Spaniards on their own\r\nterritory or on that of their allies, in their passage through the\r\ncountry. But this was unnecessary. Though Alva passed within six leagues\r\nof Geneva, and the request of the pontiff was warmly seconded by the\r\nduke of Savoy, the Spanish general did not deem it prudent to comply\r\nwith it, declaring that his commission extended no further than to the\r\nNetherlands. Without turning to the right or to the left he held on,\r\ntherefore, straight towards the mark, anxious only to extricate himself\r\nas speedily as possible from the perilous passes where he might be taken\r\nat so obvious disadvantage by an enemy.\r\n\r\nYet such were the difficulties he had to encounter, that a fortnight\r\nelapsed before he was able to set foot on the friendly plains of\r\nBurgundy,--that part of the ancient duchy which acknowledged the\r\nauthority of Spain. Here he received the welcome addition to his ranks\r\nof four hundred horse, the flower of the Burgundian chivalry. On his way\r\nacross the country he was accompanied by a French army of observation,\r\nsome six thousand strong, which moved in a parallel direction, at the\r\ndistance of six or seven leagues only from the line of march pursued by\r\nthe Spaniards,--though without offering them any molestation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HE ARRIVES AT BRUSSELS.]\r\n\r\nSoon after entering Lorraine, Alva was met by the duke of that province,\r\nwho seemed desirous to show him every respect, and entertained him with\r\nprincely hospitality. After a brief detention, the Spanish general\r\nresumed his journey, and on the 8th of August crossed the frontiers of\r\nthe Netherlands.[946]\r\n\r\nHis long and toilsome march had been accomplished without an untoward\r\naccident, and with scarcely a disorderly act on the part of the\r\nsoldiers. No man's property had been plundered. No peasant's hut had\r\nbeen violated. The cattle had been allowed to graze unmolested in the\r\nfields, and the flocks to wander in safety over their mountain pastures.\r\nOne instance only to the contrary is mentioned,--that of three troopers,\r\nwho carried off one or two straggling sheep as the army was passing\r\nthrough Lorraine. But they were soon called to a heavy reckoning for\r\ntheir transgression. Alva, on being informed of the fact, sentenced them\r\nall to the gallows. At the intercession of the duke of Lorraine, the\r\nsentence was so far mitigated by the Spanish commander, that one only of\r\nthe three, selected by lot, was finally executed.[947]\r\n\r\nThe admirable discipline maintained among Alva's soldiers was the more\r\nconspicuous in an age when the name of soldier was synonymous with that\r\nof marauder. It mattered little whether it were a friendly country or\r\nthat of a foe through which lay the line of march. The defenceless\r\npeasant was everywhere the prey of the warrior; and the general winked\r\nat the outrages of his followers, as the best means of settling their\r\narrears.\r\n\r\nWhat made the subordination of the troops, in the present instance,\r\nstill more worthy of notice, was the great number of camp followers,\r\nespecially courtesans, who hung on the skirts of the army. These latter\r\nmustered in such force, that they were divided into battalions and\r\ncompanies, marching each under its own banner, and subjected to a sort\r\nof military organization, like the men.[948] The duke seems to have been\r\nas careless of the morals of his soldiers as he was careful of their\r\ndiscipline; perhaps willing by his laxity in the one to compensate for\r\nhis severity in the other.\r\n\r\nIt was of the last importance to Alva that his soldiers should commit no\r\ntrespass, nor entangle him in a quarrel with the dangerous people\r\nthrough the midst of whom he was to pass; and who, from their superior\r\nknowledge of the country, as well as their numbers, could so easily\r\noverpower him. Fortunately, he had received such intimations before his\r\ndeparture as put him on his guard. The result was, that he obtained such\r\na mastery over his followers, and enforced so perfect a discipline, as\r\nexcited the general admiration of his contemporaries, and made his march\r\nto the Low Countries one of the most memorable events of the\r\nperiod.[949]\r\n\r\nAt Thionville the duke was waited on by Barlaimont and Noircarmes, who\r\ncame to offer the salutations of the regent, and at the same time to\r\nrequest to see his powers. At the same place, and on the way to the\r\ncapital, the duke was met by several of the Flemish nobility, who came\r\nto pay their respects to him; among the rest, Egmont, attended by forty\r\nof his retainers. On his entering Alva's presence, the duke exclaimed to\r\none of his officers, \"Here comes a great heretic!\" The words were\r\noverheard by Egmont, who hesitated a moment, naturally disconcerted by\r\nwhat would have served as an effectual warning to any other man. But\r\nAlva made haste to efface the impression caused by his heedless\r\nexclamation, receiving Egmont with so much cordiality as reassured the\r\ninfatuated nobleman, who, regarding the words as a jest, before his\r\ndeparture presented the duke with two beautiful horses.--Such is the\r\nrather singular story which comes down to us on what must be admitted to\r\nbe respectable authority.[950]\r\n\r\nSoon after he had entered the country, the duke detached the greater\r\npart of his forces to garrison some of the principal cities, and relieve\r\nthe Walloon troops on duty there, less to be trusted than his Spanish\r\nveterans. With the Milanese brigade he took the road to Brussels, which\r\nhe entered on the twenty-second of August. His cavalry he established at\r\nten leagues' distance from the capital, and the infantry he lodged in\r\nthe suburbs. Far from being greeted by acclamations, no one came out to\r\nwelcome him as he entered the city, which seemed like a place deserted.\r\nHe went straight to the palace, to offer his homage to the regent. An\r\naltercation took place on the threshold between his halberdiers and\r\nMargaret's body-guard of archers, who disputed the entrance of the\r\nSpanish soldiers. The duke himself was conducted to the bed-chamber of\r\nthe duchess, where she was in the habit of giving audience. She was\r\nstanding, with a few Flemish nobles by her side; and she remained in\r\nthat position, without stirring a single step to receive her visitor.\r\nBoth parties continued standing during the interview, which lasted half\r\nan hour; the duke during the greater part of the time with his hat in\r\nhis hand, although Margaret requested him to be covered. The curious\r\nspectators of this conference amused themselves by contrasting the\r\ncourteous and even deferential manners of the haughty Spaniard with the\r\nchilling reserve and stately demeanor of the duchess.[951] At the close\r\nof the interview Alva withdrew to his own quarters at Culemborg\r\nHouse,--the place, it will be remembered, where the Gueux held their\r\nmemorable banquet on their visit to Brussels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARGARET DISGUSTED.]\r\n\r\nThe following morning, at the request of the council of state, the duke\r\nof Alva furnished that body with a copy of his commission. By this he\r\nwas invested with the title of captain-general, and in that capacity was\r\nto exercise supreme control in all military affairs.[952] By another\r\ncommission, dated two months later, these powers were greatly enlarged.\r\nThe country was declared in a state of rebellion; and, as milder means\r\nhad failed to bring it to obedience, it was necessary to resort to arms.\r\nThe duke was therefore commanded to levy war on the refractory people,\r\nand reduce them to submission. He was moreover to inquire into the\r\ncauses of the recent troubles, and bring the suspected parties to trial,\r\nwith full authority to punish or to pardon as he might judge best for\r\nthe public weal.[953] Finally, a third commission, of more startling\r\nimport than the two preceding, and which, indeed, might seem to\r\nsupersede them altogether, was dated on the first of March, 1567. In the\r\nformer instruments the duke was so far required to act in subordination\r\nto the regent, that her authority was declared to be unimpaired. But by\r\nvirtue of this last commission he was invested with supreme control in\r\ncivil as well as military affairs; and persons of every degree,\r\nincluding the regent herself, were enjoined to render obedience to his\r\ncommands, as to those of the king.[954] Such a commission, which placed\r\nthe government of the country in the hands of Alva, was equivalent to a\r\ndismissal of Margaret. The title of \"regent,\" which still remained to\r\nher, was an empty mockery; nor could it be thought that she would be\r\ncontent to retain a barren sceptre in the country over which she had so\r\nlong ruled.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe the successive steps by which Philip had raised\r\nAlva from the rank of captain-general of the army to supreme authority\r\nin the country. It would seem as if the king were too tenacious of power\r\nreadily to part with it; and that it was only by successive efforts, as\r\nthe conviction of the necessity of such a step pressed more and more on\r\nhis mind, that he determined to lodge the government in the hands of\r\nAlva.\r\n\r\nWhether the duke acquainted the council with the full extent of his\r\npowers, or, as seems more probable, communicated to that body only his\r\nfirst two commissions, it is impossible to say. At all events, the\r\nmembers do not appear to have been prepared for the exhibition of powers\r\nso extensive, and which, even in the second of the commissions,\r\ntranscended those exercised by the regent herself. A consciousness that\r\nthey did so had led Philip, in more than one instance, to qualify the\r\nlanguage of the instrument, in such a manner as not to rouse the\r\njealousy of his sister,--an artifice so obvious, that it probably\r\nproduced a contrary effect. At any rate, Margaret did not affect to\r\nconceal her disgust, but talked openly of the affront put on her by the\r\nking, and avowed her determination to throw up the government.[955]\r\n\r\nShe gave little attention to business, passing most of her days in\r\nhunting, of which masculine sport she was excessively fond. She even\r\nthreatened to amuse herself with journeying about from place to place,\r\nleaving public affairs to take care of themselves, till she should\r\nreceive the king's permission to retire.[956] From this indulgence of\r\nher spleen she was dissuaded by her secretary, Armenteros, who, shifting\r\nhis sails to suit the breeze, showed, soon after Alva's coming, his\r\nintention to propitiate the new governor. There were others of\r\nMargaret's adherents less accommodating. Some high in office intimated\r\nvery plainly their discontent at the presence of the Spaniards, from\r\nwhich they boded only calamity to the country.[957] Margaret's\r\nconfessor, in a sermon preached before the regent, did not scruple to\r\ndenounce the Spaniards as so many \"knaves, traitors, and\r\nravishers.\"[958] And although the remonstrance of the loyal Armenteros\r\ninduced the duchess to send back the honest man to his convent, it was\r\nplain, from the warm terms in which she commended the preacher, that she\r\nwas far from being displeased with his discourse.\r\n\r\nThe duke of Alva cared little for the hatred of the Flemish lords.[959]\r\nBut he felt otherwise towards the regent. He would willingly have\r\nsoothed her irritation; and he bent his haughty spirit to show, in spite\r\nof her coldness, a deference in his manner that must have done some\r\nviolence to his nature. As a mark of respect, he proposed at once to pay\r\nher another visit, and in great state, as suited her rank. But Margaret,\r\nfeigning or feeling herself too ill to receive him, declined his visit\r\nfor some days, and at last, perhaps to mortify him the more, vouchsafed\r\nhim only a private audience in her own apartment.\r\n\r\nYet at this interview she showed more condescension than before, and\r\neven went so far as to assure the duke that there was no one whose\r\nappointment would have been more acceptable to her.[960] She followed\r\nthis, by bluntly demanding why he had been sent at all. Alva replied,\r\nthat, as she had often intimated her desire for a more efficient\r\nmilitary force, he had come to aid her in the execution of her measures,\r\nand to restore peace to the country before the arrival of his\r\nmajesty.[961]--The answer could hardly have pleased the duchess, who\r\ndoubtless considered she had done that without his aid, already.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARGARET DISGUSTED.]\r\n\r\nThe discourse fell upon the mode of quartering the troops. Alva proposed\r\nto introduce a Spanish garrison into Brussels. To this Margaret objected\r\nwith great energy. But the duke on this point was inflexible. Brussels\r\nwas the royal residence, and the quiet of the city could only be secured\r\nby a garrison. \"If people murmur,\" he concluded, \"you can tell them I am\r\na headstrong man, bent on having my own way. I am willing to take all\r\nthe odium of the measure on myself.\"[962] Thus thwarted, and made to\r\nfeel her inferiority when any question of real power was involved,\r\nMargaret felt the humiliation of her position even more keenly than\r\nbefore. The appointment of Alva had been from the first, as we have\r\nseen, a source of mortification to the duchess. In December, 1566, soon\r\nafter Philip had decided on sending the duke, with the authority of\r\ncaptain-general, to the Low Countries, he announced it in a letter to\r\nMargaret. He had been as much perplexed, he said, in the choice of a\r\ncommander, as she could have been; and it was only at her suggestion of\r\nthe necessity of some one to take the military command, that he had made\r\nsuch a nomination. Alva was, however, only to prepare the way for him,\r\nto assemble a force on the frontier, establish the garrisons, and\r\nenforce discipline among the troops till he came.[963] Philip was\r\ncareful not to alarm his sister by any hint of the extraordinary powers\r\nto be conferred on the duke, who thus seemed to be sent only in\r\nobedience to her suggestion, and in subordination to her\r\nauthority.--Margaret knew too well that Alva was not a man to act in\r\nsubordination to any one. But whatever misgivings she may have had, she\r\nhardly betrayed them in her reply to Philip, in the following February,\r\n1567, when she told the king she \"was sure he would never be so unjust,\r\nand do a thing so prejudicial to the interests of the country, as to\r\ntransfer to another the powers he had vested in her.\"[964]\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Alva may have stimulated the regent to the\r\nextraordinary efforts she then made to reduce the country to order. When\r\nshe had achieved this, she opened her mind more freely to her brother,\r\nin a letter dated July 12, 1567. \"The name of Alva was so odious in the\r\nNetherlands that it was enough to make the whole Spanish nation\r\ndetested.[965] She could never have imagined that the king would make\r\nsuch an appointment without consulting her.\" She then, alluding to\r\norders lately received from Madrid, shows extreme repugnance to carry\r\nout the stern policy of Philip;[966]--a repugnance, it must be\r\nconfessed, that seems to rest less on the character of the measures than\r\non the difficulty of their execution.\r\n\r\nWhen the duchess learned that Alva was in Italy, she wrote also to him,\r\nhoping at this late hour to arrest his progress by the assurance that\r\nthe troubles were now at an end, and that his appearance at the head of\r\nan army would only serve to renew them. But the duke was preparing for\r\nhis march across the Alps, and it would have been as easy to stop the\r\navalanche in its descent, as to stay the onward course of this \"man of\r\ndestiny.\"\r\n\r\nThe state of Margaret's feelings was shown by the chilling reception she\r\ngave the duke on his arrival in Brussels. The extent of his powers, so\r\nmuch beyond what she had imagined, did not tend to soothe the irritation\r\nof the regent's temper; and the result of the subsequent interview\r\nfilled up the measure of her indignation. However forms might be\r\nrespected, it was clear the power had passed into other hands. She wrote\r\nat once to Philip, requesting, or rather requiring, his leave to\r\nwithdraw without delay from the country. \"If he had really felt the\r\nconcern he professed for her welfare and reputation, he would have\r\nallowed her to quit the government before being brought into rivalry\r\nwith a man like the duke of Alva, who took his own course in everything,\r\nwithout the least regard to her. It afflicted her to the bottom of her\r\nsoul to have been thus treated by the king.\"[967]\r\n\r\nIt may have given some satisfaction to Margaret, that in her feelings\r\ntowards the duke she had the entire sympathy of the nation. In earlier\r\ndays, in the time of Charles the Fifth, Alva had passed some time both\r\nin Germany and in the Netherlands, and had left there no favorable\r\nimpression of his character. In the former country, indeed, his haughty\r\ndeportment on a question of etiquette had caused some embarrassment to\r\nhis master. Alva insisted on the strange privilege of the Castilian\r\ngrandee to wear his hat in the presence of his sovereign. The German\r\nnobles, scandalized by this pretension in a subject, asserted that their\r\norder had as good a right to it as the Spaniards. It was not without\r\ndifficulty that the proud duke was content to waive the contested\r\nprivilege till his return to Spain.[968]\r\n\r\nAnother anecdote of Alva had left a still more unfavorable impression of\r\nhis character. He had accompanied Charles on his memorable visit to\r\nGhent, on occasion of its rebellion. The emperor asked the duke's\r\ncounsel as to the manner in which he should deal with his refractory\r\ncapital. Alva instantly answered, \"Raze it to the ground!\" Charles,\r\nwithout replying, took the duke with him to the battlements of the\r\ncastle; and as their eyes wandered over the beautiful city spread out\r\nfar and wide below, the emperor asked him, with a pun on the French name\r\nof Ghent (_Gand_), how many Spanish hides it would take to make such a\r\n_glove_ (_gant_). Alva, who saw his master's displeasure, received the\r\nrebuke in silence. The story, whether true or not, was current among the\r\npeople of Flanders, on whom it produced its effect.[969]\r\n\r\nAlva was now sixty years old. It was not likely that age had softened\r\nthe asperity of his nature. He had, as might be expected, ever shown\r\nhimself the uncompromising enemy of the party of reform in the Low\r\nCountries. He had opposed the concession made to the nation by the\r\nrecall of Granvelle. The only concessions he recommended to Philip were\r\nin order to lull the suspicions of the great lords, till he could bring\r\nthem to a bloody reckoning for their misdeeds.[970] The general drift of\r\nhis policy was perfectly understood in the Netherlands, and the duchess\r\nhad not exaggerated when she dwelt on the detestation in which he was\r\nheld by the people.\r\n\r\nHis course on his arrival was not such as to diminish the fears of the\r\nnation. His first act was to substitute in the great towns his own\r\ntroops, men who knew no law but the will of their chief, for the Walloon\r\ngarrisons, who might naturally have some sympathy with their countrymen.\r\nHis next was to construct some fortresses, under the direction of one of\r\nthe ablest engineers in Europe. The hour had come when, in the language\r\nof the prince of Orange, his countrymen were to be bridled by the\r\nSpaniard.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POLICY OF THE DUKE.]\r\n\r\nThe conduct of Alva's soldiers underwent an ominous change. Instead of\r\nthe discipline observed on the march, they now indulged in the most\r\nreckless licence. \"One hears everywhere,\" writes a Fleming of the time,\r\n\"of the oppressions of the Spaniards. Confiscation is going on to the\r\nright and left. If a man has anything to lose, they set him down at\r\nonce as a heretic.\"[971] If the writer may be thought to have borrowed\r\nsomething from his fears,[972] it cannot be doubted that the panic was\r\ngeneral in the country. Men emigrated by thousands and tens of\r\nthousands, carrying with them to other lands the arts and manufactures\r\nwhich had so long been the boast and the source of prosperity of the\r\nNetherlands.[973] Those who remained were filled with a dismal\r\napprehension,--a boding of coming evil, as they beheld the heavens\r\ndarkening around them, and the signs of the tempest at hand.\r\n\r\nA still deeper gloom lay upon Brussels, once the gayest city in the\r\nNetherlands,--now the residence of Alva. All business was suspended.\r\nPlaces of public resort were unfrequented. The streets were silent and\r\ndeserted. Several of the nobles and wealthier citizens had gone to their\r\nestates in the country, to watch there the aspect of events.[974] Most\r\nof the courtiers who remained--the gilded insects that loved the\r\nsunshine--had left the regent's palace, and gone to pay their homage to\r\nher rival at Culemborg House. There everything went merrily as in the\r\ngayest time of Brussels. For the duke strove, by brilliant\r\nentertainments and festivities, to amuse the nobles and dissipate the\r\ngloom of the capital.[975]\r\n\r\nIn all this Alva had a deeper motive than met the public eye. He was\r\ncarrying out the policy which he had recommended to Philip. By courteous\r\nand conciliatory manners he hoped to draw around him the great nobles,\r\nespecially such as had been at all mixed up with the late revolutionary\r\nmovements. Of these, Egmont was still at Brussels; but Hoorne had\r\nwithdrawn to his estates at Weert.[976] Hoogstraten was in Germany with\r\nthe prince of Orange. As to the latter, Alva, as he wrote to the king,\r\ncould not flatter himself with the hope of his return.[977]\r\n\r\nThe duke and his son Ferdinand both wrote to Count Hoorne in the most\r\nfriendly terms, inviting him to come to Brussels.[978] But this\r\ndistrustful nobleman still kept aloof. Alva, in a conversation with the\r\ncount's secretary, expressed the warmest solicitude for the health of\r\nhis master. He had always been his friend, he said, and had seen with\r\ninfinite regret that the count's services were no better appreciated by\r\nthe king.[979] But Philip was a good prince, and if slow to recompense,\r\nthe count would find him not ungrateful. Could the duke but see the\r\ncount, he had that to say which would content him. He would find he was\r\nnot forgotten by his friends.[980] This last assurance had a terrible\r\nsignificance. Hoorne yielded at length to an invitation couched in terms\r\nso flattering. With Hoogstraten, Alva was not so fortunate. His good\r\ngenius, or the counsel of Orange, saved him from the snare, and kept him\r\nin Germany.[981]\r\n\r\nHaving nothing further to gain by delay, Alva determined to proceed at\r\nonce to the execution of his scheme. On the ninth of September the\r\ncouncil of state was summoned to meet at Culemborg House. Egmont and\r\nHoorne were present; and two or three of the officers, among them\r\nPaciotti, the engineer, were invited to discuss a plan of fortification\r\nfor some of the Flemish cities. In the mean time, strong guards had been\r\nposted at all the avenues of the house, and cavalry drawn together from\r\nthe country and established in the suburbs.\r\n\r\nThe duke prolonged the meeting until information was privately\r\ncommunicated to him of the arrest of Backerzele, Egmont's secretary, and\r\nVan Stralen, the burgomaster of Antwerp. The former was a person of\r\ngreat political sagacity, and deep in the confidence of Egmont; the\r\nlatter, the friend of Orange, with whom he was still in constant\r\ncorrespondence. The arrest of Backerzele, who resided in Brussels, was\r\nmade without difficulty, and possession was taken of his papers. Van\r\nStralen was surrounded by a body of horse, as he was driving out of\r\nAntwerp in his carriage; and both of the unfortunate gentlemen were\r\nbrought prisoners to Culemborg House.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ARREST OF EGMONT AND HOORNE.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as these tidings were conveyed to Alva, he broke up the meeting\r\nof the council. Then, entering into conversation with Egmont, he\r\nstrolled with him through the adjoining rooms, in one of which was a\r\nsmall body of soldiers. As the two nobles entered the apartment, Sancho\r\nDavila, the captain of the duke's guard, went up to Egmont, and in the\r\nking's name demanded his sword, telling him at the same time he was his\r\nprisoner.[982] The count, astounded by the proceeding, and seeing\r\nhimself surrounded by soldiers, made no attempt at resistance, but\r\ncalmly, and with much dignity in his manner, gave up his sword, saying\r\nat the same time, \"It has done the king service more than once.\"[983]\r\nAnd well might he say so; for with that sword he had won the fields of\r\nGravelines and St. Quentin.[984]\r\n\r\nHoorne fell into a similar ambuscade, in another part of the palace,\r\nwhither he was drawn while conversing with the duke's son Ferdinand de\r\nToledo, who, according to his father's account, had the whole merit of\r\narranging this little drama.[985] Neither did the admiral make any\r\nresistance; but, on learning Egmont's fate, yielded himself up, saying\r\n\"he had no right to expect to fare better than his friend.\"[986]\r\n\r\nIt now became a question as to the disposal of the prisoners. Culemborg\r\nHouse was clearly no fitting place for their confinement. Alva caused\r\nseveral castles in the neighborhood of Brussels to be examined, but they\r\nwere judged insecure. He finally decided on Ghent. The strong fortress\r\nof this city was held by one of Egmont's own partisans; but an order was\r\nobtained from the count requiring him to deliver up the keys into the\r\nhands of Ulloa, one of Alva's most trusted captains, who, at the head of\r\na corps of Spanish veterans, marched to Ghent, and relieved the Walloon\r\ngarrison of their charge. Ulloa gave proof of his vigilance, immediately\r\non his arrival, by seizing a heavy wagon loaded with valuables belonging\r\nto Egmont, as it was leaving the castle gate.[987]\r\n\r\nHaving completed these arrangements, the duke lost no time in sending\r\nthe two lords, under a strong military escort, to Ghent. Two companies\r\nof mounted arquebusiers rode in the front. A regiment of Spanish\r\ninfantry, which formed the centre, guarded the prisoners; one of whom,\r\nEgmont, was borne in a litter carried by mules, while Hoorne was in his\r\nown carriage. The rear was brought up by three companies of light horse.\r\n\r\nUnder this strong guard the unfortunate nobles were conducted through\r\nthe province where Egmont had lately ruled \"with an authority,\" writes\r\nAlva's secretary, \"greater even than that of the king.\"[988] But no\r\nattempt was made at a rescue; and as the procession entered the gates of\r\nGhent, where Egmont's popularity was equal to his power, the people\r\ngazed in stupefied silence on the stern array that was conducting their\r\nlord to the place of his confinement.[989]\r\n\r\nThe arrest of Egmont and Hoorne was known, in a few hours after it took\r\nplace, to every inhabitant of Brussels; and the tidings soon spread to\r\nthe furthest parts of the country. \"The imprisonment of the lords,\"\r\nwrites Alva to the king, \"has caused no disturbance. The tranquillity is\r\nsuch that your majesty would hardly credit it.\"[990] True; but the\r\ntranquillity was that of a man stunned by a heavy blow. If murmurs were\r\nnot loud, however, they were deep. Men mourned over the credulity of the\r\ntwo counts, who had so blindly fallen into the snare, and congratulated\r\none another on the forecast of the prince of Orange, who might one day\r\nhave the power to avenge them.[991] The event gave a new spur to\r\nemigration. In the space of a few weeks no loss than twenty thousand\r\npersons are said to have fled the country.[992] And the exiles were not\r\naltogether drawn from the humbler ranks; for no one, however high, could\r\nfeel secure when he saw the blow aimed at men like Egmont and Hoorne,\r\nthe former of whom, if he had given some cause of distrust, had long\r\nsince made his peace with the government.\r\n\r\nCount Mansfeldt made haste to send his son out of the country, lest the\r\nsympathy he had once shown for the confederates, notwithstanding his\r\nrecent change of opinion, might draw on him the vengeance of Alva. The\r\nold count, whose own loyalty could not be impeached, boldly complained\r\nof the arrest of the lords as an infringement on the rights of the\r\n_Toison d'Or_, which body alone had cognizance of the causes that\r\nconcerned their order, intimating, at the same time, his intention to\r\nsummon a meeting of the members. But he was silenced by Alva, who\r\nplainly told him, that, if the chevaliers of the order did meet, and\r\nsaid so much as the _credo_, he would bring them to a heavy reckoning\r\nfor it. As to the rights of the _Toison_, his majesty has pronounced on\r\nthem, said the duke, and nothing remains for you but to submit.[993]\r\n\r\nThe arrest and imprisonment of the two highest nobles in the land,\r\nmembers of the council of state, and that without any communication with\r\nher, was an affront to the regent which she could not brook. It was in\r\nvain that Alva excused it by saying it had been done by the order of the\r\nking, who wished to spare his sister the unpopularity which must attach\r\nto such a proceeding. Margaret made no reply. She did not complain. She\r\nwas too deeply wounded to complain. But she wrote to Philip, asking him\r\nto consider \"whether it could be advantageous to him, or decorous for\r\nher, whom he did not disdain to call his sister, that she should remain\r\nlonger in a place of which the authority was so much abridged, or rather\r\nannihilated.\"[994] She sent her secretary, Machiavelli, with her\r\ndespatches, requesting an immediate reply from Philip, and adding that,\r\nif it were delayed, she should take silence for assent, and forthwith\r\nleave the country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE COUNCIL OF BLOOD.]\r\n\r\nThe duke of Alva was entirely resigned to the proposed departure of\r\nMargaret. However slight the restraint her presence might impose on his\r\nconduct, it exacted more deference than was convenient, and compelled\r\nhim to consult appearances. Now that he had shown his hand, he was\r\nwilling to play it out boldly to the end. His first step, after the\r\narrest of the lords, was to organize that memorable tribunal for\r\ninquiring into the troubles of the country, which has no parallel in\r\nhistory save the revolutionary tribunal of the French republic. The duke\r\ndid not shrink from assuming the sole responsibility of his measures. He\r\nsaid, \"it was better for the king to postpone his visit to the\r\nNetherlands, so that his ministers might bear alone the odium of these\r\nrigorous acts. When these had been performed, he might come like a\r\ngracious prince, dispensing promises and pardon.\"[995]\r\n\r\nThis admirable coolness must be referred in part to Alva's consciousness\r\nthat his policy would receive the unqualified sanction of his master.\r\nIndeed, his correspondence shows that all he had done in the Low\r\nCountries was in accordance with a plan preconcerted with Philip. The\r\narrest of the Flemish lords, accordingly, gave entire satisfaction at\r\nthe court of Madrid, where it was looked on as the first great step in\r\nthe measures of redress. It gave equal contentment to the court of Rome,\r\nwhere it was believed that the root of heresy was to be reached only by\r\nthe axe of the executioner. Yet there was one person at that court of\r\nmore penetration than those around him, the old statesman, Granvelle,\r\nwho, when informed of the arrest of Egmont and Hoorne, inquired if the\r\nduke had \"also drawn into his net the _Silent one_,\"--as the prince of\r\nOrange was popularly called. On being answered in the negative, \"Then,\"\r\nsaid the cardinal, \"if he has not caught him, he has caught\r\nnothing.\"[996]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCRUEL POLICY OF ALVA.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Blood.--Its Organization.--General Prosecutions.--Civil\r\nWar in France.--Departure of Margaret.--Her administration reviewed.\r\n\r\n1567.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Thank God,\" writes the duke of Alva to his sovereign, on the\r\ntwenty-fourth of October, \"all is tranquil in the Low Countries.\"[997]\r\nIt was the same sentiment he had uttered a few weeks before. All was\r\nindeed tranquil. Silence reigned throughout the land. Yet it might have\r\nspoken more eloquently to the heart than the murmurs of discontent, or\r\nthe loudest tumult of insurrection. \"They say many are leaving the\r\ncountry,\" he writes in another despatch. \"It is hardly worth while to\r\narrest them. The repose of the nation is not to be brought about by\r\ncutting off the heads of those who are led astray by others.\"[998]\r\n\r\nYet in less than a week after this, we find a royal ordinance, declaring\r\nthat, \"whereas his majesty is averse to use rigor towards those who have\r\ntaken part in the late rebellion; and would rather deal with them in all\r\ngentleness and mercy,[999] it is forbidden to any one to leave the land,\r\nor to send off his effects, without obtaining a license from the\r\nauthorities, under pain of being regarded as having taken part in the\r\nlate troubles, and of being dealt with accordingly. All masters and\r\nowners of vessels, who shall aid such persons in their flight, shall\r\nincur the same penalties.\"[1000] The penalties denounced in this spirit\r\nof \"gentleness and mercy,\" were death and confiscation of property.\r\n\r\nThat the law was not a dead letter was soon shown by the arrest of ten\r\nof the principal merchants of Tournay, as they were preparing to fly to\r\nforeign parts, and by the immediate confiscation of their estates.[1001]\r\nYet Alva would have persuaded the world that he, as well as his master,\r\nwas influenced only by sentiments of humanity. To the Spanish ambassador\r\nat Rome he wrote, soon after the seizure of the Flemish lords: \"I might\r\nhave arrested more; but the king is averse to shedding the blood of his\r\npeople. I have the same disposition myself.[1002] I am pained to the\r\nbottom of my soul by the necessity of the measure.\"\r\n\r\nBut now that the great nobles had come into the snare, it was hardly\r\nnecessary to keep up the affectation of lenity; and it was not long\r\nbefore he threw away the mask altogether. The arm of justice--of\r\nvengeance--was openly raised to strike down all who had offended by\r\ntaking part in the late disturbances.\r\n\r\nThe existing tribunals were not considered as competent to this work.\r\nThe regular forms of procedure were too dilatory, and the judges\r\nthemselves would hardly be found subservient enough to the will of Alva.\r\nHe created, therefore, a new tribunal, with extraordinary powers, for\r\nthe sole purpose of investigating the causes of the late disorders, and\r\nfor bringing the authors to punishment. It was called originally the\r\n\"Council of his Excellency.\" The name was soon changed for that of the\r\n\"Council of Tumults.\" But the tribunal is better known in history by the\r\nterrible name it received from the people, of the \"_Council of\r\nBlood_.\"[1003]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE COUNCIL OF BLOOD.]\r\n\r\nIt was composed of twelve judges, \"the most learned, upright men, and of\r\nthe purest lives\"--if we may take the duke's word for it--that were to\r\nbe found in the country.[1004] Among them were Noircarmes and\r\nBarlaimont, both members of the council of state. The latter was a proud\r\nnoble, of one of the most ancient families in the land, inflexible in\r\nhis character, and stanch in his devotion to the crown. Besides these\r\nthere were the presidents of the councils of Artois and Flanders, the\r\nchancellor of Gueldres, and several jurists of repute in the country.\r\nBut the persons of most consideration in the body were two lawyers who\r\nhad come in the duke's train from Castile. One of these, the doctor Del\r\nRio, though born in Bruges, was of Spanish extraction. His most\r\nprominent trait seems to have been unlimited subserviency to the will of\r\nhis employer.[1005] The other, Juan de Vargas, was to play the most\r\nconspicuous part in the bloody drama that followed. He was a Spaniard,\r\nand had held a place in the council of the Indies. His character was\r\ninfamous; and he was said to have defrauded an orphan ward of her\r\npatrimony.[1006] When he left Spain, two criminal prosecutions are\r\nreported to have been hanging over him. This only made him the more\r\ndependent on Alva's protection. He was a man of great energy of\r\ncharacter, unwearied in application to business, unscrupulous in the\r\nservice of his employer, ready at any price to sacrifice to his own\r\ninterest, not only every generous impulse, but the common feelings of\r\nhumanity. Such, at least, are the dark colors in which he is portrayed\r\nby the writers of a nation which held him in detestation. Yet his very\r\nvices made him so convenient to the duke, that the latter soon bestowed\r\non him more of his confidence than on any other of his followers;[1007]\r\nand in his correspondence with Philip we perpetually find him commending\r\nVargas to the monarch's favor, and contrasting his \"activity, altogether\r\njuvenile,\" with the apathy of others of the council.[1008] As Vargas was\r\nunacquainted with Flemish, the proceedings of the court were conducted,\r\nfor his benefit, in Latin.[1009] Yet he was such a bungler, even in this\r\nlanguage, that his blunders furnished infinite merriment to the people\r\nof Flanders, who took some revenge for their wrongs in the ridicule of\r\ntheir oppressor.\r\n\r\nAs the new court had cognizance of all cases, civil as well as criminal,\r\nwhich grew out of the late disorders, the amount of business soon\r\npressed on them so heavily, that it was found expedient to distribute it\r\ninto several departments among the different members. Two of the body\r\nhad especial charge of the processes of the prince of Orange, his\r\nbrother Louis, Hoogstraten, Culemborg, and the rest of William's noble\r\ncompanions in exile. To Vargas and Del Rio was intrusted the trial of\r\nthe Counts Egmont and Hoorne. And two others, Blasere and Hessels, had\r\nthe most burdensome and important charge of all such causes as came from\r\nthe provinces.[1010]\r\n\r\nThe latter of these two worthies was destined to occupy a place second\r\nonly to that of Vargas on the bloody roll of persecution. He was a\r\nnative of Ghent, of sufficient eminence in his profession to fill the\r\noffice of attorney-general of his province under Charles the Fifth. In\r\nthat capacity he enforced the edicts with so much rigor as to make\r\nhimself odious to his countrymen. In the new career now opened to him,\r\nhe found a still wider field for his mischievous talents, and he entered\r\non the duties of his office with such hearty zeal as soon roused general\r\nindignation in the people, who at a later day took terrible vengeance on\r\ntheir oppressor.[1011]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Council of Troubles was organized, commissioners were\r\ndespatched into the provinces to hunt out the suspected parties. All who\r\nhad officiated as preachers, or had harbored or aided them, who had\r\njoined the consistories, who had assisted in defacing or destroying the\r\nCatholic churches or in building the Protestant, who had subscribed the\r\nCompromise, or who, in short, had taken an active part in the late\r\ndisorders, were to be arrested as guilty of treason. In the hunt after\r\nvictims informations were invited from every source. Wives were\r\nencouraged to depose against husbands, children against parents. The\r\nprisons were soon full to overflowing, and the provincial and the local\r\nmagistrates were busy in filing informations of the different cases,\r\nwhich were forwarded to the court at Brussels. When deemed of sufficient\r\nimportance, the further examination of a case was reserved for the\r\ncouncil itself. But for the most part the local authorities, or a\r\ncommission sent expressly for the purpose, were authorized to try the\r\ncause, proceeding even to a definitive sentence, which, with the grounds\r\nof it, they were to lay before the Council of Troubles. The process was\r\nthen revised by the committee for the provinces, who submitted the\r\nresult of their examination to Vargas and Del Rio. The latter were alone\r\nempowered to vote in the matter; and their sentence, prepared in\r\nwriting, was laid before the duke, who reserved to himself the right of\r\na final decision. This he did, as he wrote to Philip, that he might not\r\ncome too much under the direction of the council. \"Your majesty well\r\nknows,\" he concludes, \"that gentlemen of the law are unwilling to decide\r\nanything except upon evidence, while measures of state policy are not to\r\nbe regulated by the laws.\"[1012]\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that the different judges to whom the prisoner's\r\ncase was thus separately submitted for examination, would have afforded\r\nan additional guaranty for his security. But quite the contrary; it only\r\nmultiplied the chances of his conviction. When the provincial committee\r\npresented their report to Vargas and Del Rio,--to whom a Spanish jurist,\r\nauditor of the chancery of Valladolid, named Roda, was afterwards\r\nadded,--if it proposed sentence of death, these judges declared it \"was\r\nright, and that there was no necessity of reviewing the process.\" If, on\r\nthe contrary, a lower penalty was recommended, the worthy ministers of\r\nthe law were in the habit of returning the process, ordering the\r\ncommittee, with bitter imprecations, to revise it more carefully![1013]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE COUNCIL OF BLOOD.]\r\n\r\nAs confiscation was one of the most frequent as well as momentous\r\npenalties adjudged by the Council of Blood, it necessarily involved a\r\nlarge number of civil actions; for the estate thus forfeited was often\r\nburdened with heavy claims on it by other parties. These were all to be\r\nestablished before the council. One may readily comprehend how small was\r\nthe chance of justice before such a tribunal, where the creditor was one\r\nof the parties, and the crown the other. Even if the suit was decided in\r\nfavor of the creditor, it was usually so long protracted, and attended\r\nwith such ruinous expense, that it would have been better for him never\r\nto have urged it.[1014]\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of the court, within the limits assigned to it, wholly\r\nsuperseded that of the great court of Mechlin, as well as of every other\r\ntribunal, provincial or municipal, in the country. Its decisions were\r\nfinal. By the law of the land, established by repeated royal charters in\r\nthe provinces, no man in the Netherlands could be tried by any but a\r\nnative judge. But of the present court, one member was a native of\r\nBurgundy, and two were Spaniards.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that a tribunal with such enormous powers, which\r\ninvolved so gross an outrage on the constitutional rights and\r\nlong-established usages of the nation, would at least have been\r\nsanctioned by some warrant from the crown. It could pretend to nothing\r\nof the kind,--not even a written commission from the duke of Alva, the\r\nman who created it. By his voice alone he gave it an existence. The\r\nceremony of induction into office was performed by the new member\r\nplacing his hands between those of the duke, and swearing to remain true\r\nto the faith; to decide in all cases according to his sincere\r\nconviction; finally, to keep secret all the doings of the council, and\r\nto denounce any one who disclosed them.[1015] A tribunal clothed with\r\nsuch unbounded power, and conducted on a plan so repugnant to all\r\nprinciples of justice, fell nothing short, in its atrocity, of that\r\ninquisition so much dreaded in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nAlva, in order to be the better able to attend the council, appointed\r\nhis own palace for the place of meeting. At first the sittings were held\r\nmorning and afternoon, lasting sometimes seven hours in a day.[1016]\r\nThere was a general attendance of the members, the duke presiding in\r\nperson. After a few months, as he was drawn to a distance by more\r\npressing affairs, he resigned his place to Vargas. Barlaimont and\r\nNoircarmes, disgusted with the atrocious character of the proceedings,\r\nsoon absented themselves from the meetings. The more respectable of the\r\nmembers imitated their example. One of the body, a Burgundian, a\r\nfollower of Granvelle, having criticised the proceedings somewhat too\r\nfreely, had leave to withdraw to his own province;[1017] till at length\r\nonly three or four councillors remained,--Vargas, Del Rio, Hessels, and\r\nhis colleague,--on whom the despatch of the momentous business wholly\r\ndevolved. To some of the processes we find not more than three names\r\nsubscribed. The duke was as indifferent to forms, as he was to the\r\nrights of the nation.[1018]\r\n\r\nIt soon became apparent, that, as in most proscriptions, wealth was the\r\nmark at which persecution was mainly directed. At least, if it did not\r\nactually form a ground of accusation, it greatly enhanced the chances of\r\na conviction. The commissioners sent to the provinces received written\r\ninstructions to ascertain the exact amount of property belonging to the\r\nsuspected parties. The expense incident to the maintenance of so many\r\nofficials, as well as of a large military force, pressed heavily on the\r\ngovernment; and Alva soon found it necessary to ask for support from\r\nMadrid. It was in vain he attempted to obtain a loan from the merchants.\r\n\"They refuse,\" he writes; \"to advance a _real_ on the security of the\r\nconfiscations, till they see how _the game_ we have begun is likely to\r\nprosper!\"[1019]\r\n\r\nIn another letter to Philip, dated on the twenty-fourth of October,\r\nAlva, expressing his regret at the necessity of demanding supplies, says\r\nthat the Low Countries ought to maintain themselves, and be no tax upon\r\nSpain. He is constantly thwarted by the duchess, and by the council of\r\nfinance, in his appropriation of the confiscated property. Could he only\r\nmanage things in his own way, he would answer for it that the Flemish\r\ncities, uncertain and anxious as to their fate, would readily acquiesce\r\nin the fair means of raising a revenue proposed by the king.[1020] The\r\nambitious general, eager to secure the sole authority to himself,\r\nartfully touched on the topic which would be most likely to operate with\r\nhis master. In a note on this passage, in his own handwriting, Philip\r\nremarked that this was but just; but as he feared that supplies would\r\nnever be raised with the consent of the states, Alva must devise some\r\nexpedient by which their consent in the matter might be dispensed with,\r\nand communicate it _privately_ to him.[1021] This pregnant thought he\r\nsoon after develops more fully in a letter to the duke.[1022]--It is\r\nedifying to observe the cool manner in which the king and his general\r\ndiscuss the best means for filching a revenue from the pockets of the\r\ngood people of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GENERAL PROSECUTIONS.]\r\n\r\nMargaret,--whose name now rarely appears,--scandalized by the plan\r\navowed of wholesale persecution, and satisfied that blood enough had\r\nbeen shed already, would fain have urged her brother to grant a general\r\npardon. But to this the duke strongly objected. \"He would have every\r\nman,\" he wrote to Philip, \"feel that any day his house might fall about\r\nhis ears.[1023] Thus private individuals would be induced to pay larger\r\nsums by way of composition for their offences.\"\r\n\r\nAs the result of the confiscations, owing to the drains upon them above\r\nalluded to, proved less than he expected, the duke, somewhat later,\r\nproposed a tax of one per cent. on all property, personal and real. But\r\nto this some of the council had the courage to object, as a thing not\r\nlikely to be relished by the states. \"That depends,\" said Alva, \"on the\r\nway in which they are approached.\" He had as little love for the\r\nstates-general as his master, and looked on applications to them for\r\nmoney as something derogatory to the crown. \"I would take care to ask\r\nfor it,\" he said, \"as I did when I wanted money to build the citadel of\r\nAntwerp,--in such a way that they should not care to refuse it.\"[1024]\r\n\r\nThe most perfect harmony seems to have subsisted between the king and\r\nAlva in their operations for destroying the liberties of the nation,--so\r\nperfect, indeed, that it could have been the result only of some\r\nprevious plan, concerted probably while the duke was in Castile. The\r\ndetails of the execution were doubtless left, as they arose, to Alva's\r\ndiscretion. But they so entirely received the royal sanction,--as is\r\nabundantly shown by the correspondence,--that Philip may be said to have\r\nmade every act of his general his own. And not unfrequently we find the\r\nmonarch improving on the hints of his correspondent by some additional\r\nsuggestion.[1025] Whatever evils grew out of the male-administration of\r\nthe duke of Alva, the responsibility for the measures rests ultimately\r\non the head of Philip.\r\n\r\nOne of the early acts of the new council was to issue a summons to the\r\nprince of Orange, and to each of the noble exiles in his company, to\r\npresent themselves at Brussels, and answer the charges against them. In\r\nthe summons addressed to William, he was accused of having early\r\nencouraged a spirit of disaffection in the nation; of bringing the\r\nInquisition into contempt; of promoting the confederacy of the nobles,\r\nand opening his own palace of Breda for their discussions; of\r\nauthorizing the exercise of the reformed religion in Antwerp; in fine,\r\nof being at the bottom of the troubles, civil and religious, which had\r\nso long distracted the land. He was required, therefore, under pain of\r\nconfiscation of his property and perpetual exile, to present himself\r\nbefore the council at Brussels within the space of six weeks, and\r\nanswer the charges against him. This summons was proclaimed by the\r\npublic crier, both in Brussels and in William's own city of Breda; and a\r\nplacard containing it was affixed to the door of the principal church in\r\neach of those places.[1026]\r\n\r\nAlva followed up this act by another, which excited general indignation\r\nthrough the country. He caused the count of Buren, William's eldest son,\r\nthen a lad pursuing his studies at Louvain, to be removed from the\r\nuniversity, and sent to Spain. His tutor and several of his domestics\r\nwere allowed to accompany him. But the duke advised the king to get rid\r\nof these attendants as speedily as possible, and fill their places with\r\nSpaniards.[1027] This unwarrantable act appears to have originated with\r\nGranvelle, who recommends it in one of his letters from Rome.[1028] The\r\nobject, no doubt, was to secure some guaranty for the father's\r\nobedience, as well as to insure the loyalty of the heir of the house of\r\nNassau, and to retain him in the Catholic faith. In the last object the\r\nplan succeeded. The youth was kindly treated by Philip; and his long\r\nresidence in Spain nourished in him so strong an attachment to both\r\nChurch and crown, that he was ever after divorced from the great cause\r\nin which his father and his countrymen were embarked.\r\n\r\nThe prince of Orange published to the world his sense of the injury done\r\nto him by this high-handed proceeding of the duke of Alva; and the\r\nuniversity of Louvain boldly sent a committee to the council to\r\nremonstrate on the violation of their privileges. Vargas listened to\r\nthem with a smile of contempt, and, as he dismissed the deputation,\r\nexclaimed, \"_Non curamus vestros privilegios_,\"--an exclamation long\r\nremembered for its bad Latin as well as for its insolence.[1029]\r\n\r\nIt may well be believed that neither William nor his friends obeyed the\r\nsummons of the Council of Blood. The prince, in a reply which was\r\nprinted and circulated abroad, denied the authority of Alva to try him.\r\nAs a knight of the Golden Fleece, he had a right to be tried by his\r\npeers; as a citizen of Brabant, by his countrymen. He was not bound to\r\npresent himself before an incompetent tribunal,--one, moreover, which\r\nhad his avowed personal enemy at its head.[1030]\r\n\r\nThe prince, during his residence in Germany, experienced all those\r\nalleviations of his misfortunes which the sympathy and support of\r\npowerful friends could afford. Among these the most deserving of notice\r\nwas William the Wise, a worthy son of the famous old landgrave of Hesse\r\nwho so stoutly maintained the Protestant cause against Charles the\r\nFifth. He and the elector of Saxony, both kinsmen of William's wife,\r\noffered to provide an establishment for the prince, while he remained in\r\nGermany, which, if it was not on the magnificent scale to which he had\r\nbeen used in the Netherlands, was still not unsuited to the dignity of\r\nhis rank.[1031]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CIVIL WAR IN FRANCE.]\r\n\r\nThe little court of William received every day fresh accessions from\r\nthose who fled from persecution in the Netherlands. They brought with\r\nthem appeals to him from his countrymen to interpose in their behalf.\r\nThe hour had not yet come. But still he was not idle. He was earnestly\r\nendeavoring to interest the German princes in the cause, was\r\nstrengthening his own resources, and steadily, though silently, making\r\npreparation for the great struggle with the oppressors of his country.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were passing in the Netherlands, the neighboring\r\nmonarchy of France was torn by those religious dissensions, which, at\r\nthis period, agitated, in a greater or less degree, most of the states\r\nof Christendom. One half of the French nation was in arms against the\r\nother half. At the time of our history, the Huguenots had gained a\r\ntemporary advantage; their combined forces were beleaguering the\r\ncapital, in which the king and Catherine de Medicis, his mother, were\r\nthen held prisoners. In this extremity, Catherine appealed to Margaret\r\nto send a body of troops to her assistance. The regent hesitated as to\r\nwhat course to take, and referred the matter to Alva. He did not\r\nhesitate. He knew Philip's disposition in regard to France, and had\r\nhimself, probably, come to an understanding on the subject with the\r\nqueen-mother in the famous interview at Bayonne. He proposed to send a\r\nbody of three thousand horse to her relief. At the same time he wrote to\r\nCatherine, offering to leave the Low Countries, and march himself to her\r\nsupport with his whole strength, five thousand horse and fifteen\r\nthousand foot, all his Spanish veterans included, provided she would\r\nbring matters to an issue, and finish at once with the enemies of their\r\nreligion. The duke felt how powerfully such a result would react on the\r\nCatholic cause in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nHe besought Catherine to come to no terms with the rebels; above all, to\r\nmake them no concessions. \"Such concessions must, of necessity, be\r\neither spiritual or temporal. If spiritual, they would be opposed to the\r\nrights of God; if temporal, to the rights of the king. Better to reign\r\nover a ruined land, which yet remains true to its God and its king, than\r\nover one left unharmed for the benefit of the Devil and his followers\r\nthe heretics.\"[1032] In this declaration, breathing the full spirit of\r\nreligious and political absolutism, may be found the true key to the\r\npolicy of Alva and of his master.\r\n\r\nPhilip heartily approved of the views taken by his general.[1033] As the\r\ngreat champion of Catholicism, he looked with the deepest interest on\r\nthe religious struggle going forward in the neighboring kingdom, which\r\nexercised so direct an influence on the revolutionary movements in the\r\nNetherlands. He strongly encouraged the queen-mother to yield nothing to\r\nthe heretics. \"With his own person,\" he declared, \"and with all that he\r\npossessed, he was ready to serve the French crown in its contests with\r\nthe rebels.\"[1034] Philip's zeal in the cause was so well understood in\r\nFrance, that some of the Catholic leaders did not scruple to look to\r\nhim, rather than to their own government, as the true head of their\r\nparty.[1035]\r\n\r\nCatherine de Medicis did not discover the same uncompromising spirit,\r\nand had before this disgusted her royal son-in-law by the politic views\r\nwhich mingled with her religion. On the present occasion she did not\r\nprofit by the brilliant offer made to her by Alva to come in person at\r\nthe head of his army. She may have thought so formidable a presence\r\nmight endanger the independence of the government. Roman Catholic as she\r\nwas at heart, she preferred, with true Italian policy, balancing the\r\nrival factions against each other, to exterminating either of them\r\naltogether. The duke saw that Catherine was not disposed to strike at\r\nthe root of the evil, and that the advantages to be secured by success\r\nwould be only temporary. He contented himself, therefore, with\r\ndespatching a smaller force, chiefly of Flemish troops, under Aremberg.\r\nBefore the count reached Paris, the battle of St. Denis had been fought.\r\nMontmorenci fell; but the royal party was victorious. Catherine made a\r\ntreaty with the discomfited Huguenots, as favorable to them as if they,\r\nnot she, had won the fight. Alva, disgusted with the issue, ordered the\r\nspeedy return of Aremberg, whose presence, moreover, was needed, on a\r\nmore active theatre of operations.\r\n\r\nDuring all this while Margaret's position afforded a pitiable contrast\r\nto the splendid elevation which she had occupied for so many years as\r\nhead of the government. Not only had the actual power passed from her\r\nhands, but she felt that all her influence had gone with it. She hardly\r\nenjoyed even the right of remonstrance. In this position, she had the\r\nadvantage of being more favorably situated for criticizing the conduct\r\nof the administration, than when she was herself at the head of it. She\r\nbecame more sensible of the wrongs of the people,--now that they were\r\ninflicted by other hands than her own. She did not refuse to intercede\r\nin their behalf. She deprecated the introduction of a garrison into the\r\ngood city of Brussels. If this were necessary, she still besought the\r\nduke not to allow the loyal inhabitants to be burdened with the\r\nmaintenance of the soldiers.[1036] But he turned a deaf ear to her\r\npetition. She urged that, after the chastisement already inflicted on\r\nthe nation, the only way to restore quiet was by a general amnesty. The\r\nduke replied, that no amnesty could be so general but there must be some\r\nexceptions, and it would take time to determine who should be excepted.\r\nShe recommended that the states be called together to vote the supplies.\r\nHe evaded this also by saying it would be necessary first to decide on\r\nthe amount of the subsidy to be raised.[1037] The regent felt that in\r\nall matters of real moment she had as little weight as any private\r\nindividual in the country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEPARTURE OF MARGARET]\r\n\r\nFrom this state of humiliation she was at last relieved by the return of\r\nher secretary, Machiavelli, who brought with him despatches from Ruy\r\nGomez, Philip's favorite minister. He informed the duchess that the\r\nking, though, reluctantly, had at last acceded to her request, and\r\nallowed her to resign the government of the provinces. In token of his\r\nsatisfaction with her conduct, his majesty had raised the pension which\r\nshe had hitherto enjoyed, of eight thousand florins, to fourteen\r\nthousand, to be paid her yearly during the remainder of her life. This\r\nletter was dated on the sixth of October.[1038] Margaret soon after\r\nreceived one, dated four days later, from Philip himself, of much the\r\nsame tenor with that of his minister. The king, in a few words,\r\nintimated the regret he felt at his sister's retirement from office, and\r\nthe sense he entertained of the services she had rendered him by her\r\nlong and faithful administration.[1039]\r\n\r\nThe increase of the pension showed no very extravagant estimate of these\r\nservices; and the parsimonious tribute which, after his long silence, he\r\nnow, in a few brief sentences, paid to her deserts, too plainly\r\nintimated, that all she had done had failed to excite even a feeling of\r\ngratitude in the bosom of her brother.[1040] At the same time with the\r\nletter to Margaret came a commission to the duke of Alva, investing him\r\nwith the title of regent and governor-general, together with all the\r\npowers that had been possessed by his predecessor.[1041]\r\n\r\nMargaret made only one request of Philip previous to her departure. This\r\nhe denied her. Her father, Charles the Fifth, at the time of his\r\nabdication, had called the states-general together, and taken leave of\r\nthem in a farewell address, which was still cherished as a legacy by his\r\nsubjects. Margaret would have imitated his example. The grandeur of the\r\nspectacle pleased her imagination; and she was influenced, no doubt, by\r\nthe honest desire of manifesting, in the hour of separation, some\r\nfeelings of a kindly nature for the people over whom she had ruled for\r\nso many years.\r\n\r\nBut Philip, as we have seen, had no relish for these meetings of the\r\nstates. He had no idea of consenting to them on an emergency no more\r\npressing than the present. Margaret was obliged, therefore, to\r\nrelinquish the pageant, and to content herself with taking leave of the\r\npeople by letters addressed to the principal cities of the provinces. In\r\nthese she briefly touched on the difficulties which had lain in her\r\npath, and on the satisfaction which she felt at having, at length,\r\nbrought the country to a state of tranquillity and order. She besought\r\nthem to remain always constant in the faith in which they had been\r\nnurtured, as well as in their loyalty to a prince so benign and merciful\r\nas the king, her brother. In so doing the blessing of Heaven would rest\r\nupon them; and for her own part, she would ever be found ready to use\r\nher good offices in their behalf.[1042]\r\n\r\nShe proved her sincerity by a letter written to Philip, before her\r\ndeparture, in which she invoked his mercy in behalf of his Flemish\r\nsubjects. \"Mercy,\" she said, \"was a divine attribute. The greater the\r\npower possessed by a monarch, the nearer he approached the Deity, and\r\nthe more should he strive to imitate the divine clemency and\r\ncompassion.[1043] His royal predecessors had contented themselves with\r\npunishing the leaders of sedition, while they spared the masses who\r\nrepented. Any other course would confound the good with the bad, and\r\nbring such calamities on the country as his majesty could not fail to\r\nappreciate.\"[1044]--Well had it been for the fair fame of Margaret, if\r\nher counsels had always been guided by such wise and magnanimous\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\nThe tidings of the regent's abdication were received with dismay\r\nthroughout the provinces. All the errors of her government, her acts of\r\nduplicity, the excessive rigor with which she had of late visited\r\noffences,--all were forgotten in the regret felt for her departure. Men\r\nthought only of the prosperity which the country had enjoyed under her\r\nrule, the confidence which in earlier years she had bestowed on the\r\nfriends of the people, the generous manner in which she had interposed,\r\non more than one occasion, to mitigate the hard policy of the court of\r\nMadrid. And as they turned from these more brilliant passages of her\r\nhistory, their hearts were filled with dismay while they looked gloomily\r\ninto the future.\r\n\r\nAddresses poured in upon her from all quarters. The different cities\r\nvied with one another in expressions of regret for her departure, while\r\nthey invoked the blessings of Heaven on her remaining days. More than\r\none of the provinces gave substantial evidence of their good-will by\r\nliberal donatives. Brabant voted her the sum of twenty-five thousand\r\nflorins, and Flanders, thirty thousand.[1045] The neighboring princes,\r\nand among them Elizabeth of England, joined with the people of the\r\nNetherlands in professions of respect for the regent, as well as of\r\nregret that she was to relinquish the government.[1046]\r\n\r\nCheered by these assurances of the consideration in which she was held\r\nboth at home and abroad, Margaret quitted Brussels at the close of\r\nDecember, 1567. She was attended to the borders of Brabant by Alva, and\r\nthence conducted to Germany, by Count Mansfeldt and an escort of Flemish\r\nnobles.[1047] There bidding adieu to all that remained of her former\r\nstate, she pursued her journey quietly to Italy. For some time she\r\ncontinued with her husband in his ducal residence at Parma. But,\r\nwherever lay the fault, it was Margaret's misfortune to taste but little\r\nof the sweets of domestic intercourse. Soon afterwards she removed to\r\nNaples, and there permanently established her abode on estates which had\r\nbeen granted her by the crown. Many years later, when her son, Alexander\r\nFarnese, was called to the government of the Netherlands, she quitted\r\nher retirement to take part with him in the direction of public affairs.\r\nIt was but for a moment; and her present departure from the Netherlands\r\nmay be regarded as the close of her political existence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HER ADMINISTRATION REVIEWED.]\r\n\r\nThe government of Margaret continued from the autumn of 1559 to the end\r\nof 1567, a period of eight years. It was a stormy and most eventful\r\nperiod; for it was then that the minds of men were agitated to their\r\nutmost depths by the new doctrines which gave birth to the revolution.\r\nMargaret's regency, indeed, may be said to have furnished the opening\r\nscenes of that great drama. The inhabitants of the Low Countries were\r\naccustomed to the sway of a woman. Margaret was the third of her line\r\nthat had been intrusted with the regency. In qualifications for the\r\noffice she was probably not inferior to her predecessors. Her long\r\nresidence in Italy had made her acquainted with the principles of\r\ngovernment in a country where political science was more carefully\r\nstudied than in any other quarter of Europe. She was habitually\r\nindustrious; and her robust frame was capable of any amount of labor. If\r\nshe was too masculine in her nature to allow of the softer qualities of\r\nher sex, she was, on the other hand, exempt from the fondness for\r\npleasure and from most of the frivolities which belonged to the women of\r\nthe voluptuous clime in which she had lived. She was stanch in her\r\ndevotion to the Catholic faith; and her loyalty was such, that, from the\r\nmoment of assuming the government, she acknowledged no stronger motive\r\nthan that of conformity to the will of her sovereign. She was fond of\r\npower; and she well knew that, with Philip, absolute conformity to his\r\nwill was the only condition on which it was to be held.\r\n\r\nWith her natural good sense, and the general moderation of her views,\r\nshe would, doubtless, have ruled over the land as prosperously as her\r\npredecessors, had the times been like theirs. But, unhappily for her,\r\nthe times had greatly changed. Still Margaret, living on the theatre of\r\naction, and feeling the pressure of circumstances, would have gone far\r\nto conform to the change. But unfortunately she represented a prince,\r\ndwelling at a distance, who knew no change himself, allowed no\r\nconcessions to others,--whose conservative policy rested wholly on the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nIt was unfortunate for Margaret, that she never fully possessed the\r\nconfidence of Philip. Whether from distrust of her more accommodating\r\ntemper, or of her capacity for government, he gave a larger share of it,\r\nat the outset, to Granvelle than to her. If the regent could have been\r\nblind to this, her eyes would soon have been opened to the fact by the\r\nrivals who hated the minister. It was not long before she hated him too.\r\nBut the removal of Granvelle did not establish her in her brother's\r\nconfidence. It rather increased his distrust, by the necessity it\r\nimposed on her of throwing herself into the arms of the opposite party,\r\nthe friends of the people. From this moment Philip's confidence was more\r\nheartily bestowed on the duke of Alva, even on the banished Granvelle,\r\nthan on the regent. Her letters remained too often unanswered. The\r\nanswers, when they did come, furnished only dark and mysterious hints of\r\nthe course to be pursued. She was left to work out the problem of\r\ngovernment by herself, sure for every blunder to be called to a strict\r\naccount. Rumors of the speedy coming of the king suggested the idea that\r\nher own dominion was transitory, soon to be superseded by that of a\r\nhigher power.\r\n\r\nUnder these disadvantages she might well have lost all reliance on\r\nherself. She was not even supplied with the means of carrying out her\r\nown schemes. She was left without money, without arms, without the power\r\nto pardon,--more important, with a brave and generous race, than the\r\npower to punish. Thus, destitute of resources, without the confidence of\r\nher employer, with the people stoutly demanding concessions on the one\r\nside, with the sovereign sternly refusing them on the other, it is\r\nlittle to say that Margaret was in a false position: her position was\r\ndeplorable. She ought not to have remained in it a day after she found\r\nthat she could not hold it with honor. But Margaret was too covetous of\r\npower readily to resign it. Her misunderstanding with her husband made\r\nher, moreover, somewhat dependent on her brother.\r\n\r\nAt last came the Compromise and the league. Margaret's eyes seemed now\r\nto be first opened to the direction of the course she was taking. This\r\nwas followed by the explosion of the iconoclasts. The shock fully awoke\r\nher from her delusion. She was as zealous for the Catholic Church as\r\nPhilip himself; and she saw with horror that it was trembling to its\r\nfoundations. A complete change seemed to take place in her\r\nconvictions,--in her very nature. She repudiated all those with whom she\r\nhad hitherto acted. She embraced, as heartily as he could desire, the\r\nstern policy of Philip. She proscribed, she persecuted, she\r\npunished,--and that with an excess of rigor that does little honor to\r\nher memory. It was too late. The distrust of Philip was not to be\r\nremoved by this tardy compliance with his wishes. A successor was\r\nalready appointed; and at the very moment when she flattered herself\r\nthat the tranquillity of the country and her own authority were\r\nestablished on a permanent basis, the duke of Alva was on his march\r\nacross the mountains.\r\n\r\nYet it was fortunate for Margaret's reputation that she was succeeded in\r\nthe government by a man like Alva. The darkest spots on her\r\nadministration became light when brought into comparison with his reign\r\nof terror. From this point of view it has been criticized by the writers\r\nof her own time and those of later ages.[1048] And in this way,\r\nprobably, as the student who ponders the events of her history may\r\ninfer, a more favorable judgment has been passed upon her actions than\r\nwould be warranted by a calm and deliberate scrutiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nREIGN OF TERROR.\r\n\r\nNumerous Arrests.--Trials and Executions.--Confiscations.--Orange\r\nassembles an Army.--Battle of Heyligerlee.--Alva's Proceedings.\r\n\r\n1568.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1568, Philip, if we may trust the historians,\r\nresorted to a very extraordinary measure for justifying to the world his\r\nrigorous proceedings against the Netherlands. He submitted the case to\r\nthe Inquisition at Madrid; and that ghostly tribunal, after duly\r\nconsidering the evidence derived from the information of the king and of\r\nthe inquisitors in the Netherlands, came to the following decision. All\r\nwho had been guilty of heresy, apostasy, or sedition, and all, moreover,\r\nwho, though professing themselves good Catholics, had offered no\r\nresistance to these, were, with the exception of a few specified\r\nindividuals, thereby convicted of treason in the highest degree.[1049]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NUMEROUS ARRESTS.]\r\n\r\nThis sweeping judgment was followed by a royal edict, dated on the same\r\nday, the sixteenth of February, in which, after reciting the language of\r\nthe Inquisition, the whole nation, with the exception above stated, was\r\nsentenced, without distinction of sex or age, to the penalties of\r\ntreason,--death and confiscation of property; and this, the decree went\r\non to say, \"without any hope of grace whatever, that it might serve for\r\nan example and a warning to all future time!\"[1050]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to give credit to a story so monstrous, repeated though\r\nit has been by successive writers without the least distrust of its\r\ncorrectness. Not that anything can be too monstrous to be believed of\r\nthe Inquisition. But it is not easy to believe that a sagacious prince\r\nlike Philip the Second, however willing he might be to shelter himself\r\nunder the mantle of the Holy Office, could have lent himself to an act\r\nas impolitic as it was absurd; one that, confounding the innocent with\r\nthe guilty, would drive both to desperation,--would incite the former,\r\nfrom a sense of injury, to take up rebellion, by which there was nothing\r\nmore to lose, and the latter to persist in it, since there was nothing\r\nmore to hope.[1051]\r\n\r\nThe messenger who brought to Margaret the royal permission to resign the\r\nregency delivered to Alva his commission as captain-general of the\r\nNetherlands. This would place the duke, as Philip wrote to him, beyond\r\nthe control of the council of finance, in the important matter of the\r\nconfiscations.[1052] It raised him, indeed, not only above that council,\r\nbut above every other council in the country. It gave him an authority\r\nnot less than that of the sovereign himself. And Alva prepared to\r\nstretch this to an extent greater than any sovereign of the Netherlands\r\nhad ever ventured on. The time had now come to put his terrible\r\nmachinery into operation. The regent was gone, who, if she could not\r\ncurb, might at least criticize his actions. The prisons were full; the\r\nprocesses were completed. Nothing remained but to pass sentence and to\r\nexecute.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth of January, 1568, we find eighty-four persons sentenced to\r\ndeath at Valenciennes, on the charge of having taken part in the late\r\nmovements,--religious or political.[1053] On the twentieth of February,\r\nninety-five persons were arraigned before the Council of Blood, and\r\nthirty-seven capitally convicted.[1054] On the twentieth of March\r\nthirty-five more were condemned.[1055] The governor's emissaries were\r\nout in every direction. \"I heard that preaching was going on at\r\nAntwerp,\" he writes to Philip; \"and I sent my own provost there, for I\r\ncannot trust the authorities. He arrested a good number of heretics.\r\nThey will never attend another such meeting. The magistrates complain\r\nthat the interference of the provost was a violation of their\r\nprivileges. The magistrates may as well take it patiently.\"[1056] The\r\npleasant manner in which the duke talks over the fate of his victims\r\nwith his master may remind one of the similar dialogues between Petit\r\nAndré and Louis the Eleventh, in \"Quentin Durward.\"\r\n\r\nThe proceedings in Ghent may show the course pursued in the other\r\ncities. Commissioners were sent to that capital, to ferret out the\r\nsuspected. No than a hundred and forty-seven were summoned before the\r\ncouncil at Brussels. Their names were cried about the streets, and\r\nposted up in placards on the public buildings. Among them were many\r\nnoble and wealthy individuals. The officers were particularly instructed\r\nto ascertain the wealth of the parties. Most of the accused contrived to\r\nmake their escape. They preferred flight to the chance of an acquittal\r\nby the bloody tribunal,--though flight involved certain banishment and\r\nconfiscation of property. Eighteen only answered the summons by\r\nrepairing to Brussels. They were all arrested on the same day, at their\r\nlodgings, and, without exception, were sentenced to death! Five or six\r\nof the principal were beheaded. The rest perished on the gallows.[1057]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TRIALS AND EXECUTIONS.]\r\n\r\nImpatient of what seemed to him a too tardy method of following up his\r\ngame, the duke determined on a bolder movement, and laid his plans for\r\ndriving a goodly number of victims into the toils at once. He fixed on\r\nAsh Wednesday for the time,--the beginning of Lent, when men, after the\r\nCarnival was past, would be gathered soberly in their own\r\ndwellings.[1058] The officers of justice entered their premises at dead\r\nof night; and no less than five hundred citizens were dragged from their\r\nbeds and hurried off to prison.[1059] They all received sentence of\r\ndeath![1060] \"I have reiterated the sentence again and again,\" he writes\r\nto Philip, \"for they torment me with inquiries whether in this or that\r\ncase it might not be commuted for banishment. They weary me of my life\r\nwith their importunities.\"[1061] He was not too weary, however, to go on\r\nwith the bloody work; for in the same letter we find him reckoning that\r\nthree hundred heads more must fall before it will be time to talk of a\r\ngeneral pardon.[1062]\r\n\r\nIt was common, says an old chronicler, to see thirty or forty persons\r\narrested at once. The wealthier burghers might be seen, with their arms\r\npinioned behind them, dragged at the horse's tail to the place of\r\nexecution.[1063] The poorer sort were not even summoned to take their\r\ntrial in Brussels. Their cases were despatched at once, and they were\r\nhung up, without further delay, in the city or in the suburbs.[1064]\r\n\r\nBrandt, in his History of the Reformation, has collected many\r\nparticulars respecting the persecution, especially in his own province\r\nof Holland, during that \"reign of terror.\" Men of lower consideration,\r\nwhen dragged to prison, were often cruelly tortured on the rack, to\r\nextort confessions, implicating themselves or their friends. The modes\r\nof death adjudged by the bloody tribunal were various. Some were\r\nbeheaded with the sword,--a distinction reserved, as it would seem, for\r\npersons of condition. Some were sentenced to the gibbet, and others to\r\nthe stake.[1065] This last punishment, the most dreadful of all, was\r\nconfined to the greater offenders against religion. But it seems to have\r\nbeen left much to the caprice of the judges, sometimes even of the\r\nbrutal soldiery who superintended the executions. At least we find the\r\nSpanish soldiers, on one occasion, in their righteous indignation,\r\nthrowing into the flames an unhappy Protestant preacher whom the court\r\nhad sentenced to the gallows.[1066]\r\n\r\nThe soldiers of Alva were many of them veterans who had borne arms\r\nagainst the Protestants under Charles the Fifth,--comrades of the men\r\nwho at that very time were hunting down the natives of the New World,\r\nand slaughtering them by thousands in the name of religion. With them\r\nthe sum and substance of religion were comprised in a blind faith in the\r\nRomish Church, and in uncompromising hostility to the heretic. The life\r\nof the heretic was the most acceptable sacrifice that could be offered\r\nto Jehovah. With hearts thus seared by fanaticism, and made callous by\r\nlong familiarity with human suffering, they were the very ministers to\r\ndo the bidding of such a master as the duke of Alva.\r\n\r\nThe cruelty of the persecutors was met by an indomitable courage on the\r\npart of their victims. Most of the offences were, in some way or other,\r\nconnected with religion. The accused were preachers, or had aided and\r\ncomforted the preachers, or had attended their services, or joined the\r\nconsistories, or afforded evidence, in some form, that they had espoused\r\nthe damnable doctrines of heresy. It is precisely in such a case, where\r\nmen are called to suffer for conscience' sake, that they are prepared to\r\nendure all,--to die in defence of their opinions. The storm of\r\npersecution fell on persons of every condition; men and women, the\r\nyoung, the old, the infirm and helpless. But the weaker the party, the\r\nmore did the spirit rise to endure his sufferings. Many affecting\r\ninstances are recorded of persons who, with no support but their trust\r\nin heaven, displayed the most heroic fortitude in the presence of their\r\njudges, and, by the boldness with which they asserted their opinions,\r\nseemed even to court the crown of martyrdom. On the scaffold and at the\r\nstake this intrepid spirit did not desert them; and the testimony they\r\nbore to the truth of the cause for which they suffered had such an\r\neffect on the bystanders, that it was found necessary to silence them. A\r\ncruel device for more effectually accomplishing this was employed by the\r\nofficials. The tip of the tongue was seared with a red-hot iron, and the\r\nswollen member then compressed between two plates of metal screwed fast\r\ntogether. Thus gagged, the groans of the wretched sufferer found vent in\r\nstrange sounds, that excited the brutal merriment of his\r\ntormentors.[1067]\r\n\r\nBut it is needless to dwell longer on the miseries endured by the people\r\nof the Netherlands in this season of trial. Yet, if the cruelties\r\nperpetrated in the name of religion are most degrading to humanity, they\r\nmust be allowed to have called forth the most sublime spectacle which\r\nhumanity can present,--that of the martyr offering up his life on the\r\naltar of principle.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult--in fact, from the data in my possession, not\r\npossible--to calculate the number of those who fell by the hand of the\r\nexecutioner in this dismal persecution.[1068] The number, doubtless, was\r\nnot great as compared with the population of the country,--not so great\r\nas we may find left, almost every year of our lives, on a single\r\nbattle-field. When the forms of legal proceedings are maintained, the\r\nmovements of justice--if the name can be so profaned--are comparatively\r\ntardy. It is only, as in the French Revolution, when thousands are swept\r\ndown by the cannon, or whole cargoes of wretched victims are plunged at\r\nonce into the waters, that death moves on with the gigantic stride of\r\npestilence and war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONFISCATIONS.]\r\n\r\nBut the amount of suffering from such a persecution is not to be\r\nestimated merely by the number of those who have actually suffered\r\ndeath, when the fear of death hung like a naked sword over every man's\r\nhead. Alva had expressed to Philip the wish that every man, as he lay\r\ndown at night, or as he rose in the morning, \"might feel that his house,\r\nat any hour, might fall and crush him!\"[1069] This humane wish was\r\naccomplished. Those who escaped death had to fear a fate scarcely less\r\ndreadful, in banishment and confiscation of property. The persecution\r\nvery soon took this direction; and persecution when prompted by avarice\r\nis even more odious than when it springs from fanaticism, which,\r\nhowever degrading in itself, is but the perversion of the religious\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nSentence of perpetual exile and confiscation was pronounced at once\r\nagainst all who fled the country.[1070] Even the dead were not spared;\r\nas is shown by the process instituted against the marquis of Bergen, for\r\nthe confiscation of his estates on the charge of treason. That nobleman\r\nhad gone with Montigny, as the reader may remember, on his mission to\r\nMadrid, where he had recently died,--more fortunate than his companion,\r\nwho survived for a darker destiny. The duke's emissaries were everywhere\r\nactive in making inventories of the property of the suspected parties.\r\n\"I am going to arrest some of the richest and worst offenders,\" writes\r\nAlva to his master, \"and bring them to a pecuniary composition.\"[1071]\r\nHe shall next proceed, he says, against the delinquent cities. In this\r\nway a round sum will flow into his majesty's coffers.[1072] The victims\r\nof this class were so numerous, that we find a single sentence of the\r\ncouncil sometimes comprehending eighty or a hundred individuals. One\r\nbefore me, in fewer words than are taken up by the names of the parties,\r\ndooms no less than a hundred and thirty-five inhabitants of Amsterdam to\r\nconfiscation and exile.[1073]\r\n\r\nOne may imagine the distress brought on this once flourishing country by\r\nthis wholesale proscription; for besides the parties directly\r\ninterested, there was a host of others incidentally affected,--hospitals\r\nand charitable establishments, widows and helpless orphans, now reduced\r\nto want by the failure of the sources which supplied them with their\r\nordinary subsistence.[1074] Slow and sparing must have been the justice\r\ndoled out to such impotent creditors, when they preferred their claims\r\nto a tribunal like the Council of Blood! The effect was soon visible in\r\nthe decay of trade and the rapid depopulation of the towns.\r\nNotwithstanding the dreadful penalties denounced against fugitives,\r\ngreat numbers, especially from the border states, contrived to make\r\ntheir escape. The neighboring districts of Germany opened their arms to\r\nthe wanderers; and many a wretched exile from the northern provinces,\r\nflying across the frozen waters of the Zuyder Zee, found refuge within\r\nthe hospitable walls of Embden.[1075] Even in an inland city like Ghent,\r\nhalf the houses, if we may credit the historian, were abandoned.[1076]\r\nNot a family was there, he says, but some of its members had tasted the\r\nbitterness of exile or of death.[1077] \"The fury of persecution,\" writes\r\nthe prince of Orange, \"spreads such horror throughout the nation, that\r\nthousands, and among them some of the principal Papists, have fled a\r\ncountry where tyranny seems to be directed against all, without\r\ndistinction of faith.\"[1078]\r\n\r\nYet in a financial point of view the results did not keep pace with\r\nAlva's wishes. Notwithstanding the large amount of the confiscations,\r\nthe proceeds, as he complains to Philip, were absorbed in so many ways,\r\nespecially by the peculation of his agents, that he doubted whether the\r\nexpense would not come to more than the profits![1079] He was equally\r\ndissatisfied with the conduct of other functionaries. The commissioners\r\nsent into the provinces, instead of using their efforts to detect the\r\nguilty, seemed disposed, he said, rather to conceal them. Even the\r\nmembers of the Council of Troubles manifested so much apathy in their\r\nvocation, as to give him more annoyance than the delinquents\r\nthemselves![1080] The only person who showed any zeal in the service was\r\nVargas. He was worth all the others of the council put together.[1081]\r\nThe duke might have excepted from this sweeping condemnation Hessels,\r\nthe lawyer of Ghent, if the rumors concerning him were true. This worthy\r\ncouncillor, it is said, would sometimes fall asleep in his chair, worn\r\nout by the fatigue of trying causes and signing death-warrants. In this\r\nstate, when suddenly called on to pronounce the doom of the prisoner, he\r\nwould cry out, half awake, and rubbing his eyes, \"_Ad patibulum! Ad\r\npatibulum!_\"--\"To the gallows! To the gallows!\"[1082]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RESULTS.]\r\n\r\nBut Vargas was after the duke's own heart. Alva was never weary of\r\ncommending his follower to the king. He besought Philip to interpose in\r\nhis behalf, and cause three suits which had been brought against that\r\nfunctionary to be suspended during his absence from Spain. The king\r\naccordingly addressed the judge on the subject. But the magistrate (his\r\nname should have been preserved) had the independence to reply, that\r\n\"justice must take its course, and could not be suspended from favor to\r\nany one.\" \"Nor would I have it so,\" answered Philip, (it is the king who\r\ntells it;) \"I would do only what is possible to save the interests of\r\nVargas from suffering by his absence.\" In conclusion he tells the duke,\r\nthat Vargas should give no heed to what is said of the suits, since he\r\nmust be assured, after the letter he has received under the royal hand,\r\nthat his sovereign fully approves his conduct.[1083] But if Vargas, by\r\nhis unscrupulous devotion to the cause, won the confidence of his\r\nemployers, he incurred, on the other hand, the unmitigated hatred of the\r\npeople,--a hatred deeper, it would almost seem, than even that which\r\nattached to Alva; owing perhaps to the circumstance that, as the\r\ninstrument for the execution of the duke's measures, Vargas was brought\r\nmore immediately in contact with the people than the duke himself.\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen, many, especially of those who dwelt in the\r\nborder provinces, escaped the storm of persecution by voluntary exile.\r\nThe suspected parties would seem to have received, not unfrequently,\r\nkindly intimations from the local magistrates of the fate that menaced\r\nthem.[1084] Others, who lived in the interior, were driven to more\r\ndesperate courses. They banded together in considerable numbers, under\r\nthe name of the \"wild _Gueux_,\"--\"_Gueux sauvages_,\"--and took refuge in\r\nthe forests, particularly of West Flanders. Thence they sallied forth,\r\nfell upon unsuspecting travellers, especially the monks and\r\necclesiastics, whom they robbed, and sometimes murdered. Occasionally\r\nthey were so bold as to invade the monasteries and churches, stripping\r\nthem of their rich ornaments, their plate and other valuables, when,\r\nloaded with booty, they hurried back to their fastnesses. The evil\r\nproceeded to such a length, that the governor-general was obliged to\r\norder out a strong force to exterminate the banditti, while at the same\r\ntime he published an edict, declaring that every district should be held\r\nresponsible for the damage done to property within its limits by these\r\nmarauders.[1085]\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that, under the general feeling of resentment\r\nprovoked by Alva's cruel policy, his life would have been in constant\r\ndanger from the hand of the assassin. Once, indeed, he had nearly fallen\r\na victim to a conspiracy headed by two brothers, men of good family in\r\nFlanders, who formed a plan to kill him while attending mass at an abbey\r\nin the neighborhood of Brussels.[1086] But Alva was not destined to fall\r\nby the hand of violence.\r\n\r\nWe may well believe that wise and temperate men, like Viglius, condemned\r\nthe duke's proceedings as no less impolitic than cruel. That this\r\nveteran councillor did so is apparent from his confidential letters,\r\nthough he was too prudent to expose himself to Alva's enmity by openly\r\navowing it.[1087] There were others, however,--the princes of Germany,\r\nin particular,--who had no such reasons for dissembling, and who carried\r\ntheir remonstrances to a higher tribunal than that of the\r\ngovernor-general.\r\n\r\nOn the second of March, 1568, the Emperor Maximilian, in the name of the\r\nelectors, addressed a letter to Philip, in behalf of his oppressed\r\nsubjects in the Netherlands. He reminded the king that he had already\r\nmore than once, and in most affectionate terms, interceded with him for\r\na milder and more merciful policy towards his Flemish subjects. He\r\nentreated his royal kinsman to reflect whether it were not better to\r\ninsure the tranquillity of the state by winning the hearts of his\r\npeople, than by excessive rigor to drive them to extremity. And he\r\nconcluded by intimating that, as a member of the Germanic body, the\r\nNetherlands had a right to be dealt with in that spirit of clemency\r\nwhich was conformable to the constitutions of the empire.[1088]\r\n\r\nAlthough neither the arguments nor the importunity of Maximilian had\r\npower to shake the constancy of Philip, he did not refuse to enter into\r\nsome explanation, if not vindication, of his conduct. \"What I have\r\ndone,\" he replied, \"has been for the repose of the provinces, and for\r\nthe defence of the Catholic faith. If I had respected justice less, I\r\nshould have despatched the whole business in a single day. No one\r\nacquainted with the state of affairs will find reason to censure my\r\nseverity. Nor would I do otherwise than I have done, though I should\r\nrisk the sovereignty of the Netherlands,--no, though the world should\r\nfall in ruins around me!\"[1089]--Such a reply effectually closed the\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\nThe wretched people of the Netherlands, meanwhile, now looked to the\r\nprince of Orange as the only refuge left them, under Providence. Those\r\nwho fled the country, especially persons of higher condition, gathered\r\nround his little court at Dillemburg, where they were eagerly devising\r\nplans for the best means of restoring freedom to their country. They\r\nbrought with them repeated invitations from their countrymen to William\r\nthat he would take up arms in their defence. The Protestants of Antwerp,\r\nin particular, promised that, if he would raise funds by coining his\r\nplate, they would agree to pay him double the value of it.[1090]\r\n\r\nWilliam had no wish nearer his heart than that of assuming the\r\nenterprise. But he knew the difficulties that lay in the way, and, like\r\na wise man, he was not disposed to enter on it till he saw the means of\r\ncarrying it through successfully. To the citizens of Antwerp he\r\nanswered, that not only would he devote his plate, but his person and\r\nall that he possessed, most willingly, for the freedom of religion and\r\nof his country.[1091] But the expenses of raising a force were\r\ngreat,--at the very least, six hundred thousand florins; nor could he\r\nnow undertake to procure that amount, unless some of the principal\r\nmerchants, whom he named, would consent to remain with him as\r\nsecurity.[1092]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time he was carrying on an extensive correspondence with the\r\nGerman princes, with the leaders of the Huguenot party in France, and\r\neven with the English government,--endeavoring to propitiate them to the\r\ncause, as one in which every Protestant had an interest. From the\r\nelector of Saxony and the landgrave of Hesse he received assurances of\r\naid. Considerable sums seem to have been secretly remitted from the\r\nprincipal towns in the Low Countries; while Culemborg, Hoogstraten,\r\nLouis of Nassau, and the other great lords who shared his exile,\r\ncontributed as largely as their dilapidated fortunes would allow.[1093]\r\nThe prince himself parted with his most precious effects, pawning his\r\njewels, and sending his plate to the mint,--\"the fit ornaments of a\r\npalace,\" exclaims an old writer, \"but yielding little for the\r\nnecessities of war.\"[1094]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ORANGE ASSEMBLES AN ARMY]\r\n\r\nBy these sacrifices a considerable force was assembled before the end of\r\nApril, consisting of the most irregular and incongruous materials. There\r\nwere German mercenaries, who had no interest in the cause beyond their\r\npay; Huguenots from France, who brought into the field a hatred of the\r\nRoman Catholics which made them little welcome, even as allies, to a\r\nlarge portion of the Netherlands; and, lastly, exiles from the\r\nNetherlands,--the only men worthy of the struggle,--who held life cheap\r\nin comparison with the great cause to which they devoted it. But these,\r\nhowever strong in their patriotism, were for the most part simple\r\nburghers untrained to arms, and ill fitted to cope with the hardy\r\nveterans of Castile.\r\n\r\nBefore completing his levies, the prince of Orange, at the suggestion of\r\nhis friend, the landgrave of Hesse, prepared and published a document,\r\nknown as his \"Justification,\" in which he vindicated himself and his\r\ncause from the charges of Alva. He threw the original blame of the\r\ntroubles on Granvelle, denied having planned or even promoted the\r\nconfederacy of the nobles, and treated with scorn the charge of having,\r\nfrom motives of criminal ambition, fomented rebellion in a country where\r\nhe had larger interests at stake than almost any other inhabitant. He\r\ntouched on his own services, as well as those of his ancestors, and the\r\ningratitude with which they had been requited by the throne. And in\r\nconclusion, he prayed that his majesty might at length open his eyes to\r\nthe innocence of his persecuted subjects, and that it might be made\r\napparent to the world that the wrongs inflicted on them had come from\r\nevil counsellors rather than himself.[1095]\r\n\r\nThe plan of the campaign was, to distract the duke's attention, and, if\r\npossible, create a general rising in the country, by assailing it on\r\nthree several points at once. A Huguenot corps, under an adventurer\r\nnamed Cocqueville, was to operate against Artois. Hoogstraten, with the\r\nlord of Villers, and others of the banished nobles, were to penetrate\r\nthe country in a central direction through Brabant. While William's\r\nbrothers, the Counts Louis and Adolphus, at the head of a force, partly\r\nFlemish, partly German, were to carry the war over the northern borders,\r\ninto Groningen; the prince himself, who established his head-quarters in\r\nthe neighborhood of Cleves, was busy in assembling a force prepared to\r\nsupport any one of the divisions, as occasion might require.\r\n\r\nIt was the latter part of April, before Hoogstraten and Louis took the\r\nfield. The Huguenots ware still later; and William met with difficulties\r\nwhich greatly retarded the formation of his own corps. The great\r\ndifficulty--one which threatened to defeat the enterprise at its\r\ncommencement--was the want of money, equally felt in raising troops and\r\nin enforcing discipline among them when they were raised. \"If you have\r\nany love for me,\" he writes to his friend, the \"wise\" landgrave of\r\nHesse, \"I beseech you to aid me privately with a sum sufficient to meet\r\nthe pay of the troops for the first month. Without this I shall be in\r\ndanger of failing in my engagements,--to me worse than death; to say\r\nnothing of the ruin which such a failure must bring on our credit and on\r\nthe cause.\"[1096] We are constantly reminded, in the career of the\r\nprince of Orange, of the embarrassments under which our own Washington\r\nlabored in the time of the Revolution, and of the patience and\r\nunconquerable spirit which enabled him to surmount them.\r\n\r\nLittle need be said of two of the expeditions, which were failures.\r\nHoogstraten had scarcely crossed the frontier, towards the end of April,\r\nwhen he was met by Alva's trusty lieutenant, Sancho Davila, and beaten,\r\nwith considerable loss. Villers and some others of the rebel lords, made\r\nprisoners, escaped the sword of the enemy in the field, to fall by that\r\nof the executioner in Brussels. Hoogstraten, with the remnant of his\r\nforces, made good his retreat, and effected a junction with the prince\r\nof Orange.[1097]\r\n\r\nCocqueville met with a worse fate. A detachment of French troops was\r\nsent against him by Charles the Ninth, who thus requited the service of\r\nthe same kind he had lately received from the duke of Alva. On the\r\napproach of their countrymen, the Huguenots basely laid down their arms.\r\nCocqueville and his principal officers were surrounded, made prisoners,\r\nand perished ignominiously on the scaffold.[1098]\r\n\r\nThe enterprise of Louis of Nassau was attended with different results.\r\nYet after he had penetrated into Groningen, he was sorely embarrassed by\r\nthe mutinous spirit of the German mercenaries. The province was defended\r\nby Count Aremberg, its governor, a brave old officer, who had studied\r\nthe art of war under Charles the Fifth; one of those models of chivalry\r\non whom the men of a younger generation are ambitious to form\r\nthemselves. He had been employed on many distinguished services; and\r\nthere were few men at the court of Brussels who enjoyed higher\r\nconsideration under both Philip and his father. The strength of his\r\nforces lay in his Spanish infantry. He was deficient in cavalry, but was\r\nsoon to be reinforced by a body of horse under Count Megen, who was a\r\nday's march in his rear.\r\n\r\nAremberg soon came in sight of Louis, who was less troubled by the\r\npresence of his enemy than by the disorderly conduct of his German\r\nsoldiers, clamorous for their pay. Doubtful of his men, Louis declined\r\nto give battle to a foe so far superior to him in everything but\r\nnumbers. He accordingly established himself in an uncommonly strong\r\nposition, which the nature of the ground fortunately afforded. In his\r\nrear, protected by a thick wood, stood the convent of Heyligerlee, which\r\ngave its name to the battle. In front the land sloped towards an\r\nextensive morass. His infantry, on the left, was partly screened by a\r\nhill from the enemy's fire; and on the right he stationed his cavalry,\r\nunder the command of his brother Adolphus, who was to fall on the\r\nenemy's flank, should they be hardy enough to give battle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BATTLE OF HEYLIGERLEE.]\r\n\r\nBut Aremberg was too well acquainted with the difficulties of the ground\r\nto risk an engagement, at least till he was strengthened by the\r\nreinforcement under Megen. Unfortunately, the Spanish infantry,\r\naccustomed to victory, and feeling a contempt for the disorderly levies\r\nopposed to them, loudly called to be led against the heretics. In vain\r\ntheir more prudent general persisted in his plan. They chafed at the\r\ndelay, refusing to a Flemish commander the obedience which they might\r\nprobably have paid to one of their own nation. They openly accused him\r\nof treachery, and of having an understanding with his countrymen in the\r\nenemy's camp. Stung by their reproaches, Aremberg had the imprudence to\r\ndo what more than one brave man has been led to do, both before and\r\nsince; he surrendered his own judgment to the importunities of his\r\nsoldiers. Crying out that \"they should soon see if he were a\r\ntraitor!\"[1099] he put himself at the head of his little army, and\r\nmarched against the enemy. His artillery, meanwhile, which he had posted\r\non his right, opened a brisk fire on Louis's left wing, where, owing to\r\nthe nature of the ground, it did little execution.\r\n\r\nUnder cover of this fire the main body of the Spanish infantry moved\r\nforward; but, as their commander had foreseen, the men soon became\r\nentangled in the morass; their ranks were thrown into disorder; and when\r\nat length, after long and painful efforts, they emerged on the firm\r\nground, they were more spent with toil than they would have been after a\r\nhard day's march. Thus jaded, and sadly in disarray, they were at once\r\nassailed in front by an enemy who, conscious of his own advantage, was\r\nall fresh and hot for action. Notwithstanding their distressed\r\ncondition, Aremberg's soldiers maintained their ground for some time,\r\nlike men unaccustomed to defeat. At length, Louis ordered the cavalry on\r\nhis right to charge Aremberg's flank. This unexpected movement,\r\noccurring at a critical moment, decided the day. Assailed in front and\r\nin flank, hemmed in by the fatal morass in the rear, the Spaniards were\r\nthrown into utter confusion. In vain their gallant leader, proof against\r\ndanger, though not against the taunts of his followers, endeavored to\r\nrally them. His horse was killed under him; and as he was mounting\r\nanother, he received a shot from a foot-soldier, and fell mortally\r\nwounded from his saddle.[1100] The rout now became general. Some took to\r\nthe morass, and fell into the hands of the victors. Some succeeded in\r\ncutting their way through the ranks of their assailants, while many more\r\nlost their lives in the attempt. The ground was covered with the wounded\r\nand the dead. The victory was complete.\r\n\r\nSixteen hundred of the enemy were left on that fatal field. In the\r\nimagination of the exile thirsting for vengeance, it might serve in some\r\ndegree to balance the bloody roll of victims whom the pitiless duke had\r\nsent to their account. Nine pieces of artillery, with a large quantity\r\nof ammunition and military stores, a rich service of plate belonging to\r\nAremberg, and a considerable sum of money lately received by him to pay\r\nthe arrears of the soldiers, fell into the hands of the patriots. Yet as\r\nserious a loss as any inflicted on the Spaniards was that of their\r\nbrave commander. His corpse, disfigured by wounds, was recognized, amid\r\na heap of the slain, by the insignia of the Golden Fleece, which he wore\r\nround his neck, and which Louis sent to the prince, his brother, as a\r\nproud trophy of his victory.[1101] The joy of the conquerors was dimmed\r\nby one mournful event, the death of Count Adolphus of Nassau, who fell\r\nbravely fighting at the head of his troops, one of the first victims in\r\nthe war of the revolution. He was a younger brother of William, only\r\ntwenty-seven years of age. But he had already given promise of those\r\nheroic qualities which proved him worthy of the generous race from which\r\nhe sprung.[1102]\r\n\r\nThe battle was fought on the twenty-third of May, 1568. On the day\r\nfollowing, Count Megen arrived with a reinforcement; too late to secure\r\nthe victory, but not, as it proved, too late to snatch the fruits of it\r\nfrom the victors. By a rapid movement, he succeeded in throwing himself\r\ninto the town of Groningen, and thus saved that important place from\r\nfalling into the hands of the patriots.[1103]\r\n\r\nThe tidings of the battle of Heyligerlee caused a great sensation\r\nthrough the country. While it raised the hopes of the malecontents, it\r\nfilled the duke of Alva with indignation,--the greater as he perceived\r\nthat the loss of the battle was to be referred mainly to the misconduct\r\nof his own soldiers. He saw with alarm the disastrous effect likely to\r\nbe produced by so brilliant a success on the part of the rebels, in the\r\nvery beginning of the struggle. The hardy men of Friesland would rise to\r\nassert their independence. The prince of Orange, with his German levies,\r\nwould unite with his victorious brother, and, aided by the inhabitants,\r\nwould be in condition to make formidable head against any force that\r\nAlva could muster. It was an important crisis, and called for prompt and\r\ndecisive action. The duke, with his usual energy, determined to employ\r\nno agent here, but to take the affair into his own hands, concentrate\r\nhis forces, and march in person against the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ALVA's PROCEEDINGS.]\r\n\r\nYet there were some things he deemed necessary to be done, if it were\r\nonly for their effect on the public mind, before entering on the\r\ncampaign. On the twenty-eighth of May, sentence was passed on the prince\r\nof Orange, his brother Louis, and their noble companions. They were\r\npronounced guilty of contumacy in not obeying the summons of the\r\ncouncil, and of levying war against the king. For this they were\r\ncondemned to perpetual banishment, and their estates confiscated to the\r\nuse of the crown. The sentence was signed by the duke of Alva.[1104]\r\nWilliam's estates had been already sequestrated, and a body of Spanish\r\ntroops was quartered in his town of Breda.\r\n\r\nAnother act, of a singular nature, intimated pretty clearly the\r\ndispositions of the government. The duke caused the Hôtel de Culemborg,\r\nwhere he had fixed his own residence before the regent's departure, and\r\nwhere the Gueux had held their meetings on coming to Brussels, to be\r\nlevelled with the ground. On the spot a marble column was raised,\r\nbearing on each side of the base the following inscription: \"Here once\r\nstood the mansion of Florence Pallant,\"--the name of the count of\r\nCulemborg,--\"now razed to the ground for the execrable conspiracy\r\nplotted therein against religion, the Roman Catholic Church, the king's\r\nmajesty, and the country.\"[1105] Alva by this act intended doubtless to\r\nproclaim to the world, not so much his detestation of the\r\nconfederacy--that would have been superfluous--as his determination to\r\nshow no mercy to those who had taken part in it. Indeed, in his letters,\r\non more than one occasion, he speaks of the signers of the Compromise as\r\nmen who had placed themselves beyond the pale of mercy.\r\n\r\nBut all these acts were only the prelude to the dismal tragedy which was\r\nsoon to be performed. Nearly nine months had elapsed since the arrest of\r\nthe Counts Egmont and Hoorne. During all this time they had remained\r\nprisoners of state, under a strong guard, in the castle of Ghent. Their\r\nprosecution had been conducted in a deliberate, and indeed dilatory\r\nmanner, which had nourished in their friends the hope of a favorable\r\nissue. Alva now determined to bring the trial to a close,--to pass\r\nsentence of death on the two lords, and to carry it into execution\r\nbefore departing on his expedition.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that some of his counsellors remonstrated on the\r\nimpolicy, at a crisis like the present, of outraging the feelings of the\r\nnation, by whom Egmont in particular was so much beloved. In vain they\r\nsuggested that the two nobles would serve as hostages for the good\r\nbehavior of the people during his absence, since any tumult must only\r\ntend to precipitate the fate of the prisoners.[1106] Whether it was that\r\nAlva distrusted the effect on his master of the importunities, from\r\nnumerous quarters, in their behalf; or, what is far more likely, that he\r\nfeared lest some popular rising, during his absence, might open the\r\ngates to his prisoners, he was determined to proceed at once to their\r\nexecution. His appetite for vengeance may have been sharpened by\r\nmortification at the reverse his arms had lately experienced; and he may\r\nhave felt that a blow like the present would be the most effectual to\r\nhumble the arrogance of the nation.\r\n\r\nThere were some other prisoners of less note, but of no little\r\nconsideration, who remained to be disposed of. Their execution would\r\nprepare the public mind for the last scene of the drama. There were\r\nnineteen persons who, at this time, lay in confinement in the castle of\r\nVilvoorde, a fortress of great strength, two leagues distant from\r\nBrussels. They were chiefly men of rank, and for the most part members\r\nof the Union. For these latter, of course, there was no hope. Their\r\ntrials were now concluded, and they were only waiting their sentences.\r\nOn the ominous twenty-eighth of May, a day on which the Council of Blood\r\nseems to have been uncommonly alert, they were all, without exception,\r\ncondemned to be beheaded, and their estates were confiscated to the\r\npublic use.\r\n\r\nOn the first of June, they were brought to Brussels, having been\r\nescorted there by nine companies of Spanish infantry, were conducted to\r\nthe great square in front of the Hôtel de Ville, and, while the drums\r\nbeat to prevent their last words from reaching the ears of the\r\nby-standers, their heads were struck off by the sword of the\r\nexecutioner. Eight of the number, who died in the Roman Catholic faith,\r\nwere graciously allowed the rites of Christian burial. The heads of the\r\nremaining eleven were set upon poles, and their bodies left to rot upon\r\nthe gibbet, like those of the vilest malefactors.[1107]\r\n\r\nOn the second of June, ten or twelve more, some of them persons of\r\ndistinction, perished on the scaffold, in the same square in Brussels.\r\nAmong these was Villers, the companion of Hoogstraten in the ill-starred\r\nexpedition to Brabant, in which he was made prisoner. Since his\r\ncaptivity he had made some disclosures respecting the measures of Orange\r\nand his party, which might have entitled him to the consideration of\r\nAlva. But he had signed the Compromise.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, five other victims were led to execution within\r\nthe walls of Vilvoorde, where they had been long confined. One of these\r\nhas some interest for us, Casembrot, lord of Backerzele, Egmont's\r\nconfidential secretary. That unfortunate gentleman had been put to the\r\nrack more than once, to draw from him disclosures to the prejudice of\r\nEgmont. But his constancy proved stronger than the cruelty of his\r\npersecutors. He was now to close his sufferings by an ignominious death;\r\nso far fortunate, however, that it saved him from witnessing the fate of\r\nhis beloved master.[1108] Such were the gloomy scenes which ushered in\r\nthe great catastrophe of the fifth of June.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE EXAMINATION.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTRIALS OF EGMONT AND HOORNE.\r\n\r\nThe Examination.--Efforts in their Behalf.--Specification of\r\nCharges.--Sentence of Death.--The Processes reviewed.\r\n\r\n1568.\r\n\r\n\r\nNine months had now elapsed since the Counts Egmont and Hoorne had been\r\nimmured within the strong citadel of Ghent. During their confinement\r\nthey had met with even less indulgence than was commonly shown to\r\nprisoners of state. They were not allowed to take the air of the castle,\r\nand were debarred from all intercourse with the members of their\r\nfamilies. The sequestration of their property at the time of their\r\narrest had moreover reduced them to such extreme indigence, that but for\r\nthe care of their friends they would have wanted the common necessaries\r\nof life.[1109]\r\n\r\nDuring this period their enemies had not been idle. We have seen, at the\r\ntime of the arrest of the two nobles, that their secretaries and their\r\nprivate papers had been also seized. \"Backerzele,\" writes the duke of\r\nAlva to Philip, \"makes disclosures every day respecting his master Count\r\nEgmont. When he is put to the torture, wonders may be expected from him\r\nin this way!\"[1110] But all that the rack extorted from the unhappy man\r\nwas some obscure intimation respecting a place in which Egmont had\r\nsecreted a portion of his effects. After turning up the ground in every\r\ndirection round the castle of Ghent, the Spaniards succeeded in\r\ndisinterring eleven boxes filled with plate, and some caskets of jewels,\r\nand other precious articles,--all that now remained of Egmont's once\r\nsplendid fortune.[1111]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile commissioners were sent into the provinces placed under the\r\nrule of the two noblemen to collect information respecting their\r\ngovernment. The burgomasters of the towns were closely questioned, and,\r\nwhere they showed reluctance, were compelled by menaces to answer. But\r\nwhat Alva chiefly relied on was the examination of the prisoners\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nOn the twelfth of November, 1567, a commission composed of Vargas, Del\r\nRio, and the secretary Pratz, proceeded to Ghent, and began a personal\r\nexamination of Egmont. The interrogatories covered the whole ground of\r\nthe recent troubles. They were particularly directed to ascertain\r\nEgmont's relations with the reformed party, but above all, his\r\nconnection with the confederates,--the offence of deepest dye in the\r\nview of the commissioners. The examination continued through five days;\r\nand a record, signed and sworn to by the several parties, furnished the\r\nbasis of the future proceedings against the prisoner. A similar course\r\nwas then taken in regard to Hoorne.[1112]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the friends of the two nobles were making active\r\nexertions in their behalf. Egmont, as we have already seen, was married\r\nto a German princess, Sabina, sister of the elector of Bavaria,--a lady\r\nwho, from her rank, the charm of her manners, and her irreproachable\r\ncharacter, was the most distinguished ornament of the court of Brussels.\r\nShe was the mother of eleven children, the eldest of them still of\r\ntender age. Surrounded by this numerous and helpless family, thus\r\nsuddenly reduced from affluence to miserable penury, the countess became\r\nthe object of general commiseration. Even the stern heart of Alva seems\r\nto have been touched, as he notices her \"lamentable situation,\" in one\r\nof his letters to Philip.[1113]\r\n\r\nThe unhappy lady was fortunate in securing the services of Nicolas de\r\nLandas, one of the most eminent jurists of the country, and a personal\r\nfriend of her husband. In her name, he addressed letters to several of\r\nthe German princes, and to the Emperor Maximilian, requesting their good\r\noffices in behalf of her lord. He also wrote both to Alva and the king,\r\nless to solicit the release of Egmont--a thing little to be\r\nexpected--than to obtain the removal of the cause from the Council of\r\nBlood to a court consisting of the knights of the Golden Fleece. To this\r\nboth Egmont and Hoorne had a good claim, as belonging to that order, the\r\nstatutes of which, solemnly ratified by Philip himself, guarantied to\r\nits members the right of being tried only by their peers. The frank and\r\nindependent tone with which the Flemish jurist, himself also one of the\r\norder, and well skilled in the law, urged this claim on the Spanish\r\nmonarch, reflects honor on his memory.\r\n\r\nHoorne's wife, also a German lady of high connection, and his\r\nstep-mother, the countess-dowager, were unwearied in their exertions in\r\nhis behalf. They wrote to the knights of the Golden Fleece, in whatever\r\ncountry residing, and obtained their written testimony to the\r\ninalienable right of the accused to be tried by his brethren.[1114] This\r\nwas obviously a point of the last importance, since a trial by the\r\nCouncil of Blood was itself equivalent to a condemnation.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the electors, as well as other princes of the empire,\r\naddressed Philip directly on the subject, beseeching him to deal with\r\nthe two nobles according to the statutes of the order. Maximilian wrote\r\ntwo letters to the same purpose; and, touching on the brilliant services\r\nof Egmont, he endeavored to excite the king's compassion for the\r\ndesolate condition of the countess and her children.[1115]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPECIFICATION OF CHARGES.]\r\n\r\nBut it was not foreigners only who interceded in behalf of the lords.\r\nMansfeldt, than whom Philip had not a more devoted subject in the\r\nNetherlands, implored his sovereign to act conformably to justice and\r\nreason in the matter.[1116] Count Barlaimont, who on all occasions had\r\nproved himself no less stanch in his loyalty, found himself now in an\r\nembarrassing situation,--being both a knight of the order and a member\r\nof the Council of Troubles. He wrote accordingly to Philip, beseeching\r\nhis majesty to relieve him from the necessity of either acting like a\r\ndisloyal subject or of incurring the reproaches of his brethren.[1117]\r\n\r\nStill more worthy of notice is the interference of Cardinal Granvelle,\r\nwho, forgetting his own disgrace, for which he had been indebted to\r\nEgmont perhaps as much as to any other person, now generously interceded\r\nin behalf of his ancient foe. He invoked the clemency of Philip, as more\r\nworthy of a great prince than rigor. He called to mind the former good\r\ndeeds of the count, and declared, if he had since been led astray, the\r\nblame was chargeable on others rather than on himself.[1118] But\r\nalthough the cardinal wrote more than once to the king in this strain,\r\nit was too late to efface the impression made by former communications,\r\nin which he had accused his rival of being a party to the treasonable\r\ndesigns of the prince of Orange.[1119] This impression had been deepened\r\nby the reports from time to time received from the regent, who at one\r\nperiod, as we have seen, withdrew her confidence altogether from Egmont.\r\nThus the conviction of that nobleman's guilt was so firmly settled in\r\nthe king's mind, that, when Alva received the government of the\r\nNetherlands, there can be little doubt that Egmont was already marked\r\nout as the first great victim to expiate the sins of the nation. The\r\narguments and entreaties, therefore, used on the present occasion to\r\ndissuade Philip from his purpose, had no other effect than to quicken\r\nhis movements. Anxious to rid himself of importunities so annoying, he\r\nordered Alva to press forward the trial, adding, at the same time, that\r\nall should be made so clear that the world, whose eyes were now turned\r\non these proceedings, might be satisfied of their justice.[1120]\r\n\r\nBefore the end of December the attorney-general Du Bois had prepared the\r\narticles of accusation against Egmont. They amounted to no less than\r\nninety, some of them of great length. They chiefly rested on evidence\r\nderived from the personal examination, sustained by information gathered\r\nfrom other quarters. The first article, which, indeed, may be said to\r\nhave been the key to all the rest, charged Egmont with having conspired\r\nwith William and the other banished lords to shake off the Spanish rule,\r\nand divide the government among themselves. With this view he had made\r\nwar on the faithful Granvelle, had sought to concentrate the powers of\r\nthe various councils into one, had resisted the Inquisition, had urged\r\nthe meeting of the states-general, in short, had thwarted, as far as\r\npossible, in every particular, the intentions of the king. He was\r\naccused, moreover, of giving encouragement to the sectaries. He had not\r\nonly refused his aid when asked to repress their violence, but had\r\nrepeatedly licensed their meetings, and allowed them to celebrate their\r\nreligious rites. Egmont was too stanch a Catholic to warrant his own\r\nfaith being called into question. It was only in connection with the\r\npolitical movements of the country that he was supposed to have\r\ncountenanced the party of religious reform. Lastly he was charged, not\r\nonly with abetting the confederacy of the nobles, but with having, in\r\nconjunction with the prince of Orange and his associates, devised the\r\noriginal plan of it. It was proof of the good-will he bore the league,\r\nthat he had retained in his service more than one member of his\r\nhousehold after they had subscribed the Compromise. On these various\r\ngrounds, Egmont was declared to be guilty of treason.[1121]\r\n\r\nThe charges, which cover a great space, would seem at the first glance\r\nto be crudely put together, confounding things trivial, and even\r\nirrelevant to the question, with others of real moment.[1122] Yet they\r\nmust be admitted to have been so cunningly prepared as to leave an\r\nimpression most unfavorable to the innocence of the prisoner. The\r\nattorney-general, sometimes audaciously perverting the answers of\r\nEgmont,[1123] at other times giving an exaggerated importance to his\r\noccasional admissions, succeeded in spreading his meshes so artfully,\r\nthat it required no slight degree of coolness and circumspection, even\r\nin an innocent party, to escape from them.\r\n\r\nThe instrument was delivered to Egmont on the twenty-ninth of December.\r\nFive days only were allowed him to prepare his defence,--and that too\r\nwithout the aid of a friend to support, or of counsel to advise him. He\r\nat first resolutely declined to make a defence at all, declaring that he\r\nwas amenable to no tribunal but that of the members of the order. Being\r\ninformed, however, that if he persisted he would be condemned for\r\ncontumacy, he consented, though with a formal protest against the\r\nproceeding as illegal, to enter on his defence.\r\n\r\nHe indignantly disclaimed the idea of any design to subvert the existing\r\ngovernment. He admitted the charges in regard to his treatment of\r\nGranvelle, and defended his conduct on the ground of expediency,--of its\r\nbeing demanded by the public interest. On the same ground he explained\r\nhis course in reference to some of the other matters charged on him, and\r\nespecially in relation to the sectaries,--too strong in numbers, he\r\nmaintained, to be openly resisted. He positively denied the connection\r\nimputed to him with the confederates; declaring that, far from\r\ncountenancing the league, he had always lamented its existence, and\r\ndiscouraged all within his reach from joining it. In reply to the charge\r\nof not having dismissed Backerzele after it was known that he had joined\r\nthe confederates, he excused himself by alleging the good services which\r\nhis secretary had rendered the government, more especially in repressing\r\nthe disorders of the iconoclasts. On the whole, his answers seem to have\r\nbeen given in good faith, and convey the impression--probably not far\r\nfrom the truth--of one who, while he did not approve of the policy of\r\nthe crown, and thought, indeed, some of its measures impracticable, had\r\nno design to overturn the government.[1124]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEFENCE OF THE PRISONERS.]\r\n\r\nThe attorney-general next prepared his accusation of Count Hoorne,\r\nconsisting of sixty-three separate charges. They were of much the same\r\nimport with those brought against Egmont. The bold, impatient temper of\r\nthe admiral made him particularly open to the assault of his enemies.\r\nHe was still more peremptory than his friend in his refusal to\r\nrelinquish his rights as a knight of the Golden Fleece, and appear\r\nbefore the tribunal of Alva. When prevailed on to waive his scruples,\r\nhis defence was couched in language so direct and manly as at once\r\nengages our confidence. \"Unskilled as I am in this sort of business,\" he\r\nremarks, \"and without the aid of counsel to guide me, if I have fallen\r\ninto errors, they must be imputed, not to intention, but to the want of\r\nexperience.... I can only beseech those who shall read my defence to\r\nbelieve that it has been made sincerely and in all truth, as becomes a\r\ngentleman of honorable descent.\"[1125]\r\n\r\nBy the remonstrances of the prisoners and their friends, the duke was at\r\nlength prevailed on to allow them counsel. Each of the two lords\r\nobtained the services of five of the most eminent jurists of the\r\ncountry; who, to their credit, seem not to have shrunk from a duty\r\nwhich, if not attended with actual danger, certainly did not lie in the\r\nroad to preferment.[1126]\r\n\r\nThe counsel of the two lords lost no time in preparing the defence of\r\ntheir clients, taking up each charge brought against them by the\r\nattorney-general, and minutely replying to it. Their defence was\r\nsubstantially the same with that which had been set up by the prisoners\r\nthemselves, though more elaborate, and sustained by a greater array both\r\nof facts and arguments.[1127] Meanwhile the counsel did not remit their\r\nefforts to have the causes brought before the tribunal of the _Toison\r\nd'Or_. Unless this could be effected, they felt that all endeavors to\r\nestablish the innocence of their clients would be unavailing.\r\n\r\nAlva had early foreseen the embarrassment to which he would be exposed\r\non this ground. He had accordingly requested Philip to stop all further\r\nsolicitations by making known his own decision in the matter.[1128] The\r\nking in reply assured the duke that men of authority and learning, to\r\nwhom the subject had been committed, after a full examination, entirely\r\nconfirmed the decision made before Alva's departure, that the case of\r\ntreason did not come within the cognizance of the _Toison d'Or_.[1129]\r\nLetters patent accompanied this note, empowering the duke to try the\r\ncause.[1130] With these credentials Alva now strove to silence, if not\r\nto satisfy, the counsel of the prisoners; and, by a formal decree, all\r\nfurther applications for transferring the cause from his own\r\njurisdiction to that of the Golden Fleece were peremptorily forbidden.\r\n\r\nYet all were not to be thus silenced. Egmont's countess still continued\r\nunwearied in her efforts to excite a sympathy in her lord's behalf in\r\nall those who would be likely to have any influence with the government.\r\nEarly in 1568 she again wrote to Philip, complaining that she had not\r\nbeen allowed so much as to see her husband. She implored the king to\r\ntake her and her children as sureties for Egmont, and permit him to be\r\nremoved to one of his own houses. If that could not be, she begged that\r\nhe might at least be allowed the air of the castle, lest, though\r\ninnocent, his confinement might cost him his life. She alludes to her\r\nmiserable condition, with her young and helpless family, and trusts in\r\nthe king's goodness and justice that she shall not be forced to seek a\r\nsubsistence in Germany, from which country she had been brought to\r\nFlanders by his father the emperor.[1131] The letter, says a chronicler\r\nof the time, was not to be read by any one without sincere commiseration\r\nfor the writer.[1132]\r\n\r\nThe German princes, at the same time, continued their intercessions with\r\nthe king for both the nobles; and the duke of Bavaria, and the duke and\r\nduchess of Lorraine, earnestly invoked his clemency in their behalf.\r\nPhilip, wearied by this importunity but not wavering in his purpose,\r\nagain called on Alva to press the trial to a conclusion.[1133]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of April, 1568, came that irruption across the borders\r\nby Hoogstraten and the other lords, described in the previous chapter.\r\nAlva, feeling probably that his own presence might be required to check\r\nthe invaders, found an additional motive for bringing the trials to a\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth of May, the attorney-general presented a remonstrance\r\nagainst the dilatory proceedings of Egmont's counsel, declaring that,\r\nalthough so many months had elapsed, they had neglected to bring forward\r\ntheir witnesses in support of their defence. He prayed that a day might\r\nbe named for the termination of the process.[1134]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SENTENCE OF DEATH.]\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of May, news came of the battle won by Louis of\r\nNassau in the north. That now became certain which had before been only\r\nprobable,--that Alva must repair in person to the seat of war, and\r\nassume the command of the army. There could be no further delay. On the\r\nfirst of June, a decree was published declaring that the time allowed\r\nfor the defence of the prisoners had expired, and that no evidence could\r\nhenceforth be admitted.[1135] The counsel for the accused loudly\r\nprotested against a decision which cut them off from all means of\r\nestablishing the innocence of their clients. They had abundant testimony\r\nat hand, they said, and had only waited until the government should have\r\nproduced theirs. This was plausible, as it was in the regular course for\r\nthe prosecuting party to take precedence. But one can hardly doubt that\r\nthe wary lawyers knew that too little was to be expected from a tribunal\r\nlike the Council of Blood to wish to have the case brought to a\r\ndecision. By delaying matters, some circumstance might occur,--perhaps\r\nsome stronger expression of the public sentiment,--to work a favorable\r\nchange in the mind of the king. Poor as it was, this was the only chance\r\nfor safety; and every day that the decision was postponed was a day\r\ngained to their clients.\r\n\r\nBut no time was given for expostulation. On the day on which Alva's\r\ndecree was published, the affair was submitted to the decision of the\r\nCouncil of Blood; and on the following morning, the second of June, that\r\nbody--or rather Vargas and Del Rio, the only members who had a voice in\r\nthe matter--pronounced both the prisoners guilty of treason, and doomed\r\nthem to death. The sentence was approved by Alva.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the fourth, Alva went in person to the meeting of the\r\ncouncil. The sentences of the two lords, each under a sealed envelope,\r\nwere produced, and read aloud by the secretary. They were both of\r\nprecisely the same import. After the usual preamble, they pronounced the\r\nCounts Egmont and Hoorne to have been proved parties to the abominable\r\nleague and conspiracy of the prince of Orange and his associates; to\r\nhave given aid and protection to the confederates; and to have committed\r\nsundry malepractices in their respective governments in regard to the\r\nsectaries, to the prejudice of the holy Catholic faith. On these grounds\r\nthey were adjudged guilty of treason and rebellion, and were sentenced\r\naccordingly to be beheaded with the sword, their heads to be set upon\r\npoles, and there to continue during the pleasure of the duke; their\r\npossessions, fiefs, and rights, of every description, to be confiscated\r\nto the use of the crown.[1136] These sentences were signed only with the\r\nname of Alva, and countersigned with that of the secretary Pratz.[1137]\r\n\r\nSuch was the result of these famous trials, which, from the peculiar\r\ncircumstances that attended them, especially their extraordinary\r\nduration and the illustrious characters and rank of the accused, became\r\nan object of general interest throughout Europe. In reviewing them, the\r\nfirst question that occurs is in regard to the validity of the grounds\r\non which the causes were removed from the jurisdiction of the _Toison\r\nd'Or_. The decision of the \"men of authority and learning,\" referred to\r\nby the king, is of little moment considering the influences under which\r\nsuch a decision in the court of Madrid was necessarily given. The only\r\nauthority of any weight in favor of this interpretation seems to have\r\nbeen that of the president Viglius; a man well versed in the law, with\r\nthe statutes of the order before him, and, in short, with every facility\r\nat his command for forming an accurate judgment in the matter.\r\n\r\nHis opinion seems to have mainly rested on the fact that, in the year\r\n1473, a knight of the order, charged with a capital crime, submitted to\r\nbe tried by the ordinary courts of law. But, on the other hand, some\r\nyears later, in 1490, four knights accused of treason, the precise crime\r\nalleged against Egmont and Hoorne, were arraigned and tried before the\r\nmembers of the _Toison_. A more conclusive argument against Viglius was\r\nafforded by the fact, that in 1531 a law was passed, under the Emperor\r\nCharles the Fifth, that no knight of the Golden Fleece could be arrested\r\nor tried, for any offence whatever, by any other body than the members\r\nof his own order. This statute was solemnly confirmed by Philip himself\r\nin 1550; and no law, surely, could be devised covering more effectually\r\nthe whole ground in question. Yet Viglius had the effrontery to set this\r\naside as of no force, being so clearly in contempt of all precedents and\r\nstatutes. A subterfuge like this, which might justify the disregard of\r\nany law whatever, found no favor with the members of the order. Arschot\r\nand Barlaimont, in particular, the most devoted adherents of the crown,\r\nand among the few knights of the _Toison_ then in Brussels, openly\r\nexpressed their dissent. The authority of a jurist like Viglius was of\r\ngreat moment, however, to the duke, who did not fail to parade it.[1138]\r\nBut sorely was it to the disgrace of that timid and time-serving\r\ncouncillor, that he could thus lend himself, and in such a cause, to\r\nbecome the tool of arbitrary power. It may well lead us to give easier\r\nfaith than we should otherwise have done to those charges of peculation\r\nand meanness which the regent, in the heat of party dissensions, so\r\nliberally heaped on him.[1139]\r\n\r\nBut whatever may be thought of the rights possessed by the _Toison d'Or_\r\nin this matter, there can be no doubt as to the illegality of the court\r\nbefore which the cause was brought;--a court which had no warrant for\r\nits existence but the will of Alva; where the judges, contrary to the\r\nlaw of the land, were foreigners; where the presiding officer was not\r\neven necessarily present at the trial of the causes on which he alone\r\nwas to pass sentence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PROCESSES REVIEWED.]\r\n\r\nIf so little regard was paid to the law in the composition of this\r\ntribunal, scarcely more was shown to it in the forms of proceeding. On\r\nthe present occasion it does not appear that any evidence was brought\r\nforward by the prisoners. And as we are in possession of only a small\r\npart of that which sustained the prosecution, it is not easy to form an\r\nopinion how far the parties were or were not guilty of the crime\r\nimputed to them; still less whether that crime, according to the laws of\r\nthe land, amounted to treason.[1140] The gravest charge made, with any\r\napparent foundation, was that of a secret understanding with the\r\nconfederates. The avowed object of the confederates was, in certain\r\ncontingencies, to resist the execution of a particular ordinance;[1141]\r\nbut without any design to overturn the government. This, by our law,\r\ncould hardly be construed into treason. But in the Netherlands, in the\r\ntime of the Spanish rule, the law may have been more comprehensive in\r\nits import; nor is it likely that the word \"treason\" was limited in so\r\nexplicit a manner as by the English statute-book under the\r\nPlantagenets.[1142]\r\n\r\nWe have information of a curious document of the time, that may throw\r\nlight on the matter. Peter d'Arset, president of Artois, was one of the\r\noriginal members of the Council of Troubles, but had retired from office\r\nbefore the trial of the two lords. It may have been from the high\r\njudicial station he held in one of Egmont's provinces, that he was\r\nconsulted in regard to that nobleman's process. After an examination of\r\nthe papers, he returned an answer, written in Latin, at great length,\r\nand with a purity of style that shows him to have been a scholar. In\r\nthis, he goes over the whole ground of the accusation, article by\r\narticle, showing the insufficiency of proof on every charge, and by\r\nargument and legal reference fully establishing the innocence of the\r\naccused. The president's opinion, so independently given, we may readily\r\nbelieve, found too little favor with the duke of Alva to be cited as\r\nauthority.[1143]\r\n\r\nBut even though it were true that the two lords, in that season of\r\npublic excitement, had been seduced from their allegiance for a time,\r\nsome charity might have been shown to men who had subsequently broken\r\nwith their former friends, and displayed the utmost zeal in carrying out\r\nthe measures of the government; a zeal in the case of Egmont, at least,\r\nwhich drew from the regent unqualified commendation.[1144] Something\r\nmore might have been conceded to the man who had won for his sovereign\r\nthe most glorious trophies of his reign. But Philip's nature, unhappily,\r\nas I have had occasion to notice, was of that sort which is more\r\nsensible to injuries than to benefits.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances attending this trial, it may seem to have been a\r\nwaste of time to inquire into the legality of the court which tried the\r\ncause, or the regularity of the forms of procedure. The real trial took\r\nplace, not in Flanders, but in Castile. Who can doubt that, long before\r\nthe duke of Alva began his march, the doom of the two nobles had been\r\npronounced in the cabinet of Madrid?[1145]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nEXECUTION OF EGMONT AND HOORNE.\r\n\r\nThe Counts removed to Brussels.--Informed of the Sentence.--Procession\r\nto the Scaffold.--The Execution.--Character of Egmont.--Fate of his\r\nFamily.--Sentiment of the People.\r\n\r\n1568.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the second of June, 1568, a body of three thousand men was ordered to\r\nGhent to escort the Counts Egmont and Hoorne to Brussels. No resistance\r\nwas offered, although the presence of the Spaniards caused a great\r\nsensation among the inhabitants of the place, who too well foreboded the\r\nfate of their beloved lord.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INFORMED OF THE SENTENCE.]\r\n\r\nThe nobles, each accompanied by two officers, were put into separate\r\nchariots. They were guarded by twenty companies of pikemen and\r\narquebusiers; and a detachment of lancers, among whom was a body of the\r\nduke's own horse, rode in the van, while another of equal strength\r\nprotected the rear. Under this strong escort they moved slowly towards\r\nBrussels. One night they halted at Dendermonde, and towards evening, on\r\nthe fourth of the month, entered the capital.[1146] As the martial array\r\ndefiled through its streets, there was no one, however stout-hearted he\r\nmight be, says an eye-witness, who could behold the funeral pomp of the\r\nprocession, and listen to the strains of melancholy music, without a\r\nfeeling of sickness at his heart.[1147]\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were at once conducted to the _Brodhuys_, or\r\n\"Bread-House,\" usually known as the _Maison du Roi_,--that venerable\r\npile in the market-place of Brussels, still visited by every traveller\r\nfor its curious architecture, and yet more as the last resting-place of\r\nthe Flemish lords. Here they were lodged in separate rooms, small, dark,\r\nand uncomfortable, and scantily provided with furniture. Nearly the\r\nwhole of the force which had escorted them to Brussels was established\r\nin the great square, to defeat any attempt at a rescue. But none was\r\nmade; and the night passed away without disturbance, except what was\r\noccasioned by the sound of busy workmen employed in constructing a\r\nscaffold for the scene of execution on the following day.[1148]\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the fourth, the duke of Alva had sent for Martin\r\nRithovius, bishop of Ypres; and, communicating to him the sentence of\r\nthe nobles, he requested the prelate to visit the prisoners, acquaint\r\nthem with their fate, and prepare them for their execution on the\r\nfollowing day. The bishop, an excellent man, and the personal friend of\r\nEgmont, was astounded by the tidings. He threw himself at Alva's feet,\r\nimploring mercy for the prisoners, and, if he could not spare their\r\nlives, beseeching him at least to grant them more time for preparation.\r\nBut Alva sternly rebuked the prelate, saying that he had been summoned,\r\nnot to thwart the execution of the law, but to console the prisoners,\r\nand enable them to die like Christians.[1149] The bishop, finding his\r\nentreaties useless, rose and addressed himself to his melancholy\r\nmission.\r\n\r\nIt was near midnight when he entered Egmont's apartment, where he found\r\nthe poor nobleman, whose strength had been already reduced by\r\nconfinement, and who was wearied by the fatigue of the journey, buried\r\nin slumber. It is said that the two lords, when summoned to Brussels,\r\nhad indulged the vain hope that it was to inform them of the conclusion\r\nof their trial and their acquittal![1150] However this may be, Egmont\r\nseems to have been but ill prepared for the dreadful tidings he\r\nreceived. He turned deadly pale as he listened to the bishop, and\r\nexclaimed, with deep emotion: \"It is a terrible sentence. Little did I\r\nimagine that any offence I had committed against God or the king could\r\nmerit such a punishment. It is not death that I fear. Death is the\r\ncommon lot of all. But I shrink from dishonor. Yet I may hope that my\r\nsufferings will so far expiate my offences, that my innocent family will\r\nnot be involved in my ruin by the confiscation of my property. Thus\r\nmuch, at least, I think I may claim in consideration of my past\r\nservices.\" Then, after a pause, he added, \"Since my death is the will of\r\nGod and his majesty, I will try to meet it with patience.\"[1151] He\r\nasked the bishop if there were no hope. On being answered, \"None\r\nwhatever,\" he resolved to devote himself at once to preparing for the\r\nsolemn change.\r\n\r\nHe rose from his couch, and hastily dressed himself. He then made his\r\nconfession to the prelate, and desired that mass might be said, and the\r\nsacrament administered to him. This was done with great solemnity; and\r\nEgmont received the communion in the most devout manner, manifesting the\r\ngreatest contrition for his sins. He next inquired of the bishop to what\r\nprayer he could best have recourse to sustain him in this trying hour.\r\nThe prelate recommended to him that prayer which our Saviour had\r\ncommended to his disciples. The advice pleased the count, who earnestly\r\nengaged in his devotions. But a host of tender recollections crowded on\r\nhis mind; and the images of his wife and children drew his thoughts in\r\nanother direction, till the kind expostulations of the prelate again\r\nrestored him to himself.\r\n\r\nEgmont asked whether it would be well to say anything on the scaffold\r\nfor the edification of the people. But the bishop discouraged him,\r\nsaying that he would be imperfectly heard, and that the people, in their\r\npresent excitement, would be apt to misinterpret what he said to their\r\nown prejudice.\r\n\r\nHaving attended to his spiritual concerns, Egmont called for writing\r\nmaterials, and wrote a letter to his wife, whom he had not seen during\r\nhis long confinement; and to her he now bade a tender farewell. He then\r\naddressed another letter, written in French, in a few brief and touching\r\nsentences, to the king,--which fortunately has been preserved to us.\r\n\"This morning,\" he says, \"I have been made acquainted with the sentence\r\nwhich it has pleased your majesty to pass upon me. And although it has\r\nnever been my intent to do aught against the person or the service of\r\nyour majesty, or against our true, ancient, and Catholic faith, yet I\r\nreceive in patience what it has pleased God to send me.[1152] If during\r\nthese troubles I have counselled or permitted aught which might seem\r\notherwise, I have done so from a sincere regard for the service of God\r\nand your majesty, and from what I believed the necessity of the times.\r\nWherefore I pray your majesty to pardon it, and for the sake of my past\r\nservices to take pity on my poor wife, my children, and my servants. In\r\nthis trust, I commend myself to the mercy of God.\" The letter is dated\r\nBrussels, \"on the point of death,\" June 5, 1568.[1153]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PROCESSION TO THE SCAFFOLD.]\r\n\r\nHaving time still left, the count made a fair copy of the two letters,\r\nand gave them to the bishop, entreating him to deliver them according to\r\ntheir destination. He accompanied that to Philip with a ring, to be\r\ngiven at the same time to the monarch.[1154] It was of great value; and\r\nas it had been the gift of Philip himself during the count's late visit\r\nto Madrid, it might soften the heart of the king by reminding him of\r\nhappier days, when he had looked with an eye of favor on his unhappy\r\nvassal.\r\n\r\nHaving completed all his arrangements, Egmont became impatient for the\r\nhour of his departure; and he expressed the hope that there would be no\r\nunnecessary delay.[1155] At ten in the morning the soldiers appeared who\r\nwere to conduct him to the scaffold. They brought with them cords, as\r\nusual, to bind the prisoner's hands. But Egmont remonstrated, and showed\r\nthat he had, himself, cut off the collar of his doublet and shirt, in\r\norder to facilitate the stroke of the executioner. This he did to\r\nconvince them that he meditated no resistance; and on his promising that\r\nhe would attempt none, they consented to his remaining with his hands\r\nunbound.\r\n\r\nEgmont was dressed in a crimson damask robe, over which was a Spanish,\r\nmantle fringed with gold. His breeches were of black silk; and his hat,\r\nof the same material, was garnished with white and sable plumes.[1156]\r\nIn his hand, which, as we have seen, remained free, he held a white\r\nhandkerchief. On his way to the place of execution, he was accompanied\r\nby Julian de Romero, _maître de camp_, by the captain, Salinas, who had\r\ncharge of the fortress of Ghent, and by the bishop of Ypres. As the\r\nprocession moved slowly forward, the count repeated some portion of the\r\nfifty-first psalm,--\"Have mercy on me, O God!\"--in which the good\r\nprelate joined with him. In the centre of the square, on the spot where\r\nso much of the best blood of the Netherlands has been shed, stood the\r\nscaffold, covered with black cloth. On it were two velvet cushions with\r\na small table, shrouded likewise in black, and supporting a silver\r\ncrucifix. At the corners of the platform were two poles, pointed at the\r\nend with steel, intimating the purpose for which they were\r\nintended.[1157]\r\n\r\nIn front of the scaffold was the provost of the court, mounted on\r\nhorseback and bearing the red wand of office in his hand.[1158] The\r\nexecutioner remained, as usual, below the platform, screened from view,\r\nthat he might not, by his presence before it was necessary, outrage the\r\nfeelings of the prisoners.[1159] The troops, who had been under arms\r\nall night, were drawn up around in order of battle; and strong bodies of\r\narquebusiers were posted in the great avenues which led to the square.\r\nThe space left open by the soldiery was speedily occupied by a crowd of\r\neager spectators. Others thronged the roofs and windows of the buildings\r\nthat surrounded the market-place, some of which, still standing at the\r\npresent day, show, by their quaint and venerable architecture, that they\r\nmust have looked down on the tragic scene we are now depicting.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a gloomy day for Brussels,--so long the residence of the\r\ntwo nobles, where their forms were as familiar, and where they were held\r\nin as much love and honor as in any of their own provinces. All business\r\nwas suspended. The shops were closed. The bells tolled in all the\r\nchurches. An air of gloom, as of some impending calamity, settled on the\r\ncity. \"It seemed,\" says one residing there at the time, \"as if the day\r\nof judgment were at hand!\"[1160]\r\n\r\nAs the procession slowly passed through the ranks of the soldiers,\r\nEgmont saluted the officers--some of them his ancient companions--with\r\nsuch a sweet and dignified composure in his manner as was long\r\nremembered by those who saw it. And few even of the Spaniards could\r\nrefrain from tears, as they took their last look at the gallant noble\r\nwho was to perish by so miserable an end.[1161]\r\n\r\nWith a steady step he mounted the scaffold, and, as he crossed it, gave\r\nutterance to the vain wish, that, instead of meeting such a fate, he had\r\nbeen allowed to die in the service of his king and country.[1162] He\r\nquickly, however, turned to other thoughts, and, kneeling on one of the\r\ncushions, with the bishop beside him on the other, he was soon engaged\r\nearnestly in prayer. With his eyes raised towards Heaven with a look of\r\nunutterable sadness,[1163] he prayed so fervently and loud as to be\r\ndistinctly heard by the spectators. The prelate, much affected, put into\r\nhis hands the silver crucifix, which Egmont repeatedly kissed; after\r\nwhich, having received absolution for the last time, he rose and made a\r\nsign to the bishop to retire. He then stripped off his mantle and robe;\r\nand again kneeling, he drew a silk cap, which he had brought for the\r\npurpose, over his eyes, and repeating the words, \"Into thy hands, O\r\nLord, I commend my spirit,\" he calmly awaited the stroke of the\r\nexecutioner.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THEIR LAST MOMENTS.]\r\n\r\nThe low sounds of lamentation, which from time to time had been heard\r\namong the populace, were now hushed into silence,[1164] as the minister\r\nof justice appearing on the platform, approached his victim, and with a\r\nsingle blow of the sword severed the head from the body. A cry of horror\r\nrose from the multitude, and some frantic with grief, broke through the\r\nranks of the soldiers, and wildly dipped their handkerchiefs in the\r\nblood that streamed from the scaffold, treasuring them up, says the\r\nchronicler, as precious memorials of love and incitements to\r\nvengeance.[1165]--The head was then set on one of the poles at the end\r\nof the platform, while a mantle thrown over the mutilated trunk hid it\r\nfrom the public gaze.[1166]\r\n\r\nIt was near noon, when orders were sent to lead forth the remaining\r\nprisoner to execution. It had been assigned to the curate of La Chapelle\r\nto acquaint Count Hoorne with his fate. That nobleman received the awful\r\ntidings with less patience than was shown by his friend. He gave way to\r\na burst of indignation at the cruelty and injustice of the sentence. It\r\nwas a poor requital, he said, for eight and twenty years of faithful\r\nservices to his sovereign. Yet, he added, he was not sorry to be\r\nreleased from a life of such incessant fatigue.[1167] For some time he\r\nrefused to confess, saying he had done enough in the way of\r\nconfession.[1168] When urged not to throw away the few precious moments\r\nthat were left to him, he at length consented.\r\n\r\nThe count was dressed in a plain suit of black, and wore a Milanese cap\r\nupon his head. He was, at this time, about fifty years of age. He was\r\ntall, with handsome features, and altogether of a commanding\r\npresence.[1169] His form was erect, and as he passed with a steady step\r\nthrough the files of soldiers, on his way to the place of execution, he\r\nfrankly saluted those of his acquaintance whom he saw among the\r\nspectators. His look had in it less of sorrow than of indignation, like\r\nthat of one conscious of enduring wrong. He was spared one pang, in his\r\nlast hour, which had filled Egmont's cup with bitterness; though, like\r\nhim, he had a wife, he was to leave no orphan family to mourn him.\r\n\r\nAs he trod the scaffold, the apparatus of death seemed to have no power\r\nto move him. He still repeated the declaration, that, \"often as he had\r\noffended his Maker, he had never, to his knowledge, committed any\r\noffence against the king.\" When his eyes fell on the bloody shroud that\r\nenveloped the remains of Egmont, he inquired if it were the body of his\r\nfriend. Being answered in the affirmative, he made some remark in\r\nCastilian, not understood. He then prayed for a few moments, but in so\r\nlow a tone, that the words were not caught by the by-standers, and,\r\nrising, he asked pardon of those around if he had ever offended any of\r\nthem, and earnestly besought their prayers. Then, without further delay,\r\nhe knelt down, and, repeating the words \"_In manus tuas, Domine_,\" he\r\nsubmitted himself to his fate.[1170]\r\n\r\nHis bloody head was set up opposite to that of his fellow-sufferer. For\r\nthree hours these ghastly trophies remained exposed to the gaze of the\r\nmultitude. They were then taken down, and, with the bodies, placed in\r\nleaden coffins, which were straightway removed,--that containing the\r\nremains of Egmont to the convent of Santa Clara, and that of Hoorne to\r\nthe ancient church of St. Gudule. To these places, especially to Santa\r\nClara, the people now flocked, as to the shrine of a martyr. They threw\r\nthemselves on the coffin, kissing it and bedewing it with their tears,\r\nas if it had contained the relics of some murdered saint;[1171] while\r\nmany of them, taking little heed of the presence of informers, breathed\r\nvows of vengeance; some even swearing not to trim either hair or beard\r\ntill these vows were executed.[1172] The government seems to have\r\nthought it prudent to take no notice of this burst of popular feeling.\r\nBut a funeral hatchment, blazoned with the arms of Egmont, which, as\r\nusual after the master's death, had been fixed by his domestics on the\r\ngates of his mansion, was ordered to be instantly removed; no doubt, as\r\ntending to keep alive the popular excitement.[1173] The bodies were not\r\nallowed to remain long in their temporary places of deposit, but were\r\ntransported to the family residences of the two lords in the country,\r\nand laid in the vaults of their ancestors.[1174]\r\n\r\nThus by the hand of the common executioner perished these two\r\nunfortunate noblemen, who, by their rank, possessions, and personal\r\ncharacters, were the most illustrious victims that could have been\r\nselected in the Netherlands. Both had early enjoyed the favor of Charles\r\nthe Fifth, and both had been intrusted by Philip with some of the\r\nhighest offices in the state. Philip de Montmorency, Count Hoorne, the\r\nelder of the two, came of the ancient house of Montmorency in France.\r\nBesides filling the high post of Admiral of the Low Countries, he was\r\nmade governor of the provinces of Gueldres and Zutphen, was a councillor\r\nof state, and was created by the emperor a knight of the Golden Fleece.\r\nHis fortune was greatly inferior to that of Count Egmont; yet its\r\nconfiscation afforded a supply by no means unwelcome to the needy\r\nexchequer of the duke of Alva.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHARACTER OF EGMONT.]\r\n\r\nHowever nearly on a footing they might be in many respects, Hoorne was\r\naltogether eclipsed by his friend in military renown. Lamoral, Count\r\nEgmont, inherited through his mother, the most beautiful woman of her\r\ntime,[1175] the title of prince of Gavre,--a place on the Scheldt, not\r\nfar from Ghent. He preferred, however, the more modest title of count of\r\nEgmont, which came to him by the father's side, from ancestors who had\r\nreigned over the duchy of Gueldres. The uncommon promise which he early\r\ngave served, with his high position, to recommend him to the notice of\r\nthe Emperor Charles the Fifth, who, in 1544, honored by his presence\r\nEgmont's nuptials with Sabina, countess-palatine of Bavaria. In 1546,\r\nwhen scarcely twenty-four years of age, he was admitted to the order of\r\nthe Golden Fleece,--and, by a singular coincidence, on the same day on\r\nwhich that dignity was bestowed on the man destined to become his mortal\r\nfoe, the duke of Alva.[1176] Philip, on his accession, raised him to the\r\ndignity of a councillor of state, and made him governor of the important\r\nprovinces of Artois and Flanders.\r\n\r\nBut every other title to distinction faded away before that derived from\r\nthose two victories, which left the deepest stain on the French arms\r\nthat they had received since the defeat at Pavia. \"I have seen,\" said\r\nthe French ambassador, who witnessed the execution of Egmont, \"I have\r\nseen the head of that man fall who twice caused France to\r\ntremble.\"[1177]\r\n\r\nYet the fame won by his success was probably unfortunate for Egmont. For\r\nthis, the fruit of impetuous valor and of a brilliant _coup-de-main_,\r\nwas very different from the success of a long campaign, implying genius\r\nand great military science in the commander. Yet the _éclat_ it gave was\r\nenough to turn the head of a man less presumptuous than Egmont. It\r\nplaced him at once on the most conspicuous eminence in the country;\r\ncompelling him, in some sort, to take a position above his capacity to\r\nmaintain. When the troubles broke out, Egmont was found side by side\r\nwith Orange, in the van of the malecontents. He was urged to this rather\r\nby generous sensibility to the wrongs of his countrymen, than by any\r\nsettled principle of action. Thus acting from impulse, he did not, like\r\nWilliam, calculate the consequences of his conduct. When those\r\nconsequences came, he was not prepared to meet them; he was like some\r\nunskilful necromancer, who has neither the wit to lay the storm which he\r\nhas raised, nor the hardihood to brave it. He was acted on by contrary\r\ninfluences. In opposition to the popular movement came his strong\r\nfeeling of loyalty, and his stronger devotion to the Roman Catholic\r\nfaith. His personal vanity coöperated with these; for Egmont was too\r\nmuch of a courtier willingly to dispense with the smiles of royalty.\r\nThus the opposite forces by which he was impelled served to neutralize\r\neach other. Instead of moving on a decided one of conduct, like his\r\nfriend, William of Orange, he appeared weak and vacillating. He\r\nhesitated where he should have acted. And as the storm thickened, he\r\neven retraced his steps, and threw himself on the mercy of the monarch\r\nwhom he had offended. William better understood the character of his\r\nmaster,--and that of the minister who was to execute his decrees.[1178]\r\n\r\nStill, with all his deficiencies, there was much both in the personal\r\nqualities of Egmont and in his exploits to challenge admiration. \"I knew\r\nhim,\" says Brantôme, \"both in France and in Spain, and never did I meet\r\nwith a nobleman of higher breeding, or more gracious in his\r\nmanners.\"[1179] With an address so winning, a heart so generous, and\r\nwith so brilliant a reputation, it is not wonderful that Egmont should\r\nhave been the pride of his court and the idol of his countrymen. In\r\ntheir idolatry they could not comprehend that Alva's persecution should\r\nnot have been prompted by a keener feeling than a sense of public duty\r\nor obedience to his sovereign. They industriously sought in the earlier\r\nhistory of the rival chiefs the motives for personal pique. On Alva's\r\nfirst visit to the Netherlands, Egmont, then a young man, was said to\r\nhave won of him a considerable sum at play. The ill-will thus raised in\r\nAlva's mind was heightened by Egmont's superiority over him at a\r\nshooting-match, which the people, regarding as a sort of national\r\ntriumph, hailed with an exultation that greatly increased the\r\nmortification of the duke.[1180] But what filled up the measure of his\r\njealousy was his rival's military renown; for the Fabian policy which\r\ndirected Alva's campaigns, however it established his claims to the\r\nreputation of a great commander, was by no means favorable to those\r\nbrilliant feats of arms which have such attraction for the multitude. So\r\nintense, indeed, was the feeling of hatred, it was said, in Alva's\r\nbosom, that, on the day of his rival's execution, he posted himself\r\nbehind a lattice of the very building in which Egmont had been confined,\r\nthat he might feast his eyes with the sight of his mortal agony.[1181]\r\n\r\nThe friends of Alva give a very different view of his conduct. According\r\nto them, an illness under which he labored, at the close of Egmont's\r\ntrial, was occasioned by his distress of mind at the task imposed on him\r\nby the king. He had written more than once to the court of Castile, to\r\nrequest some mitigation of Egmont's sentence, but was answered, that\r\n\"this would have been easy to grant, if the offence had been against the\r\nking; but against the faith, it was impossible.\"[1182] It was even said\r\nthat the duke was so much moved, that he was seen to shed tears as big\r\nas peas on the day of the execution![1183]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONDUCT OF ALVA.]\r\n\r\nI must confess, I have never seen any account that would warrant a\r\nbelief in the report that Alva witnessed in person the execution of his\r\nprisoners. Nor, on the other hand, have I met with any letter of his\r\ndeprecating the severity of their sentence, or advising a mitigation of\r\ntheir punishment. This, indeed, would be directly opposed to his policy,\r\nopenly avowed. The reader may, perhaps, recall the homely simile by\r\nwhich he recommended to the queen-mother, at Bayonne, to strike at the\r\ngreat nobles in preference to the commoners. \"One salmon,\" he said, \"was\r\nworth ten thousand frogs.\"[1184] Soon after Egmont's arrest, some of the\r\nburghers of Brussels waited on him to ask why it had been made. The duke\r\nbluntly told them, \"When he had got together his troops, he would let\r\nthem know.\"[1185] Everything shows that, in his method of proceeding in\r\nregard to the two lords, he had acted on a preconcerted plan, in the\r\narrangement of which he had taken his full part. In a letter to Philip,\r\nwritten soon after the execution, he speaks with complacency of having\r\ncarried out the royal views in respect to the great offenders.[1186] In\r\nanother, he notices the sensation caused by the death of Egmont; and\r\n\"the greater the sensation,\" he adds, \"the greater will be the benefit\r\nto be derived from it.\"[1187]--There is little in all this of\r\ncompunction for the act, or of compassion for its victims.\r\n\r\nThe truth seems to be, that Alva was a man of an arrogant nature, an\r\ninflexible will, and of the most narrow and limited views. His doctrine\r\nof implicit obedience went as far as that of Philip himself. In\r\nenforcing it, he disdained the milder methods of argument or\r\nconciliation. It was on force, brute force alone, that he relied. He was\r\nbred a soldier, early accustomed to the stern discipline of the camp.\r\nThe only law he recognized was martial law; his only argument, the\r\nsword. No agent could have been fitter to execute the designs of a\r\ndespotic prince. His hard, impassible nature was not to be influenced by\r\nthose affections which sometimes turn the most obdurate from their\r\npurpose. As little did he know of fear; nor could danger deter him from\r\ncarrying out his work. The hatred he excited in the Netherlands was\r\nsuch, that, as he was warned, it was not safe for him to go out after\r\ndark. Placards were posted up in Brussels menacing his life if he\r\npersisted in the prosecution of Egmont.[1188] He held such menaces as\r\nlight as he did the entreaties of the countess, or the arguments of her\r\ncounsel. Far from being moved by personal considerations, no power could\r\nturn him from that narrow path which he professed to regard as the path\r\nof duty. He went surely, though it might be slowly, towards the mark,\r\ncrushing by his iron will every obstacle that lay in his track. We\r\nshudder at the contemplation of such a character, relieved by scarcely a\r\nsingle touch of humanity. Yet we must admit there is something which\r\nchallenges our admiration in the stern, uncompromising manner, without\r\nfear or favor, with which a man of this indomitable temper carries his\r\nplans into execution.\r\n\r\nIt would not be fair to omit, in this connection, some passages from\r\nAlva's correspondence, which suggest the idea that he was not wholly\r\ninsensible to feelings of compassion,--when they did not interfere with\r\nthe performance of his task. In a letter to the king, dated the ninth of\r\nJune, four days only after the death of the two nobles, the duke says:\r\n\"Your majesty will understand the regret I feel at seeing these poor\r\nlords brought to such an end, and myself obliged to bring them to\r\nit.[1189] But I have not shrunk from doing what is for your majesty's\r\nservice. Indeed, they and their accomplices have been the cause of very\r\ngreat present evil, and one which will endanger the souls of many for\r\nyears to come. The Countess Egmont's condition fills me with the\r\ngreatest pity, burdened as she is with a family of eleven children, none\r\nold enough to take care of themselves;--and she too a lady of so\r\ndistinguished rank, sister of the count-palatine, and of so virtuous,\r\ntruly Catholic, and exemplary life.[1190] There is no man in the country\r\nwho does not grieve for her! I cannot but commend her,\" he concludes,\r\n\"as I do now, very humbly, to the good grace of your majesty, beseeching\r\nyou to call to mind that if the count, her husband, came to trouble at\r\nthe close of his days, he formerly rendered great service to the\r\nstate.\"[1191] The reflection, it must be owned, came somewhat late.\r\n\r\nIn another letter to Philip, though of the same date, Alva recommends\r\nthe king to summon the countess and her children to Spain; where her\r\ndaughters might take the veil, and her sons be properly educated. \"I do\r\nnot believe,\" he adds, \"that there is so unfortunate a family in the\r\nwhole world. I am not sure that the countess has the means of procuring\r\na supper this very evening!\"[1192]\r\n\r\nPhilip, in answer to these letters, showed that he was not disposed to\r\nshrink from his own share of responsibility for the proceedings of his\r\ngeneral. The duke, he said, had only done what justice and his duty\r\ndemanded.[1193] He could have wished that the state of things had\r\nwarranted a different result; nor could he help feeling deeply that\r\nmeasures like those to which he had been forced should have been\r\nnecessary in his reign. \"But,\" continued the king, \"no man has a right\r\nto shrink from his duty.[1194]--I am well pleased,\" he concludes, \"to\r\nlearn that the two lords made so good and Catholic an end. As to what\r\nyou recommend in regard to the countess of Egmont and her eleven\r\nchildren, I shall give all proper heed to it.\"[1195]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FATE OF EGMONT'S FAMILY.]\r\n\r\nThe condition of the countess might well have moved the hardest heart\r\nto pity. Denied all access to her husband, she had been unable to\r\nafford him that consolation which he so much needed during his long and\r\ndreary confinement. Yet she had not been idle; and, as we have seen, she\r\nwas unwearied in her efforts to excite a sympathy in his behalf. Neither\r\ndid she rely only on the aid which this world can give; and few nights\r\npassed during her lord's imprisonment in which she and her daughters\r\nmight not be seen making their pious pilgrimages, barefooted, to the\r\ndifferent churches of Brussels, to invoke the blessing of Heaven on\r\ntheir labors. She had been supported through this trying time by a\r\nreliance on the success of her endeavors, in which she was confirmed by\r\nthe encouragement she received from the highest quarters. It is not\r\nnecessary to give credit to the report of a brutal jest attributed to\r\nthe duke of Alva, who, on the day preceding the execution, was said to\r\nhave told the countess \"to be of good cheer; for her husband would leave\r\nthe prison on the morrow!\"[1196] There is more reason to believe that\r\nthe Emperor Maximilian, shortly before the close of the trial, sent a\r\ngentleman with a kind letter to the countess, testifying the interest he\r\ntook in her affairs, and assuring her she had nothing to fear on account\r\nof her husband.[1197] On the very morning of Egmont's execution, she was\r\nherself, we are told, paying a visit of condolence to the countess of\r\nAremberg, whose husband had lately fallen in the battle of Heyligerlee;\r\nand at her friend's house the poor lady is said to have received the\r\nfirst tidings of the fate of her lord.[1198]\r\n\r\nThe blow fell the heavier, that she was so ill prepared for it. On the\r\nsame day she found herself, not only a widow, but a beggar,--with a\r\nfamily of orphan children in vain looking up to her for the common\r\nnecessaries of life.[1199] In her extremity, she resolved to apply to\r\nthe king himself. She found an apology for it in the necessity of\r\ntransmitting to Philip her husband's letter to him, which, it seems, had\r\nbeen intrusted to her care.[1200] She apologizes for not sooner sending\r\nthis last and most humble petition of her deceased lord, by the extreme\r\nwretchedness of her situation, abandoned, as she is, by all, far from\r\nkindred and country.[1201] She trusts in his majesty's benignity and\r\ncompassion[1202] to aid her sons by receiving them into his service when\r\nthey shall be of sufficient age. This will oblige her, during the\r\nremainder of her sad days, and her children after her, to pray God for\r\nthe long and happy life of his majesty.[1203]--It must have given\r\nanother pang to the heart of the widowed countess, to have been thus\r\nforced to solicit aid from the very hand that had smitten her. But it\r\nwas the mother pleading for her children.\r\n\r\nYet Philip, notwithstanding his assurances to the duke of Alva, showed\r\nno alacrity in relieving the wants of the countess. On the first of\r\nSeptember the duke again wrote, to urge the necessity of her case,\r\ndeclaring that, if it had not been for a \"small sum that he had himself\r\nsent, she and the children would have perished of hunger!\"[1204]\r\n\r\nThe misfortunes of this noble lady excited commiseration not only at\r\nhome, but in other countries of Europe, and especially in Germany, the\r\nland of her birth.[1205] Her brother, the elector of Bavaria, wrote to\r\nPhilip, to urge the restitution of her husband's estates to his family.\r\nOther German princes preferred the same request, which was moreover\r\nformally made by the emperor, through his ambassador at Madrid. Philip\r\ncoolly replied, that \"the time for this had not yet come.\"[1206] A\r\nmoderate pension, meanwhile, was annually paid by Alva to the countess\r\nof Egmont, who survived her husband ten years,--not long enough to see\r\nher children established in possession of their patrimony.[1207] Shortly\r\nbefore her death, her eldest son, then grown to man's estate, chafing\r\nunder the sense of injustice to himself and his family, took part in the\r\nwar against the Spaniards. Philip, who may perhaps have felt some\r\ncompunction for the ungenerous requital he had made for the father's\r\nservices, not only forgave this act of disloyalty in the son, but three\r\nyears later allowed the young man to resume his allegiance, and placed\r\nhim in full possession of the honors and estates of his ancestors.[1208]\r\n\r\nAlva, as we have seen, in his letters to Philip, had dwelt on the\r\nimportant effects of Egmont's execution. He did not exaggerate these\r\neffects. But he sorely mistook the nature of them. Abroad, the elector\r\nof Bavaria at once threw his whole weight into the scale of Orange and\r\nthe party of reform.[1209] Others of the German princes followed his\r\nexample; and Maximilian's ambassador at Madrid informed Philip that the\r\nexecution of the two nobles, by the indignation it had caused throughout\r\nGermany, had wonderfully served the designs of the prince of\r\nOrange.[1210]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SENTIMENT OF THE PEOPLE.]\r\n\r\nAt home the effects were not less striking. The death of these two\r\nillustrious men, following so close upon the preceding executions,\r\nspread a deep gloom over the country. Men became possessed with the idea\r\nthat the reign of blood was to be perpetual.[1211] All confidence was\r\ndestroyed, even that confidence which naturally exists between parent\r\nand child, between brother and brother.[1212] The foreign merchant\r\ncaught somewhat of this general distrust, and refused to send his\r\ncommodities to a country where they were exposed to confiscation.[1213]\r\nYet among the inhabitants indignation was greater than even fear or\r\nsorrow;[1214] and the Flemings who had taken part in the prosecution of\r\nEgmont trembled before the wrath of an avenging people.[1215] Such were\r\nthe effects produced by the execution of men whom the nation reverenced\r\nas martyrs in the cause of freedom. Alva notices these consequences in\r\nhis letters to the king. But though he could discern the signs of the\r\ntimes, he little dreamed of the extent of the troubles they portended.\r\n\"The people of this country,\" he writes, \"are of so easy a temper, that,\r\nwhen your majesty shall think fit to grant them a general pardon, your\r\nclemency, I trust, will make them as prompt to render you their\r\nobedience as they are now reluctant to do it.\"[1216]--The haughty\r\nsoldier, in his contempt for the peaceful habits of a burgher\r\npopulation, comprehended as little as his master the true character of\r\nthe men of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nSECRET EXECUTION OF MONTIGNY.\r\n\r\nBergen and Montigny.--Their Situation in Spain.--Death of\r\nBergen.--Arrest of Montigny.--Plot for his Escape.--His\r\nProcess.--Removal to Simancas.--Closer Confinement.--Midnight Execution.\r\n\r\n1567-1570.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore bidding a long adieu to the Netherlands, it will be well to lay\r\nbefore the reader an account of a transaction which has proved a\r\nfruitful theme of speculation to the historian, but which, until the\r\npresent time, has been shrouded in impenetrable mystery.\r\n\r\nIt may be remembered that, in the year 1566, two noble Flemings, the\r\nmarquis of Bergen and the baron of Montigny, were sent on a mission to\r\nthe court of Madrid, to lay before the king the critical state of\r\naffairs, imperatively demanding some change in the policy of the\r\ngovernment. The two lords went on the mission; but they never returned.\r\nMany conjectures were made respecting their fate; and historians have\r\nconcluded that Bergen possibly,[1217] and certainly Montigny, came to\r\ntheir end by violence.[1218] But, in the want of evidence, it was only\r\nconjecture, while the greatest discrepancy has prevailed in regard to\r\ndetails. It is not till very recently that the veil has been withdrawn\r\nthrough the access that has been given to the Archives of Simancas, that\r\ndread repository, in which the secrets of the Castilian kings have been\r\nburied for ages. Independently of the interest attaching to the\r\ncircumstances of the present narrative, it is of great importance for\r\nthe light it throws on the dark, unscrupulous policy of Philip the\r\nSecond. It has, moreover, the merit of resting on the most authentic\r\ngrounds of the correspondence of the king and his ministers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BERGEN AND MONTIGNY.]\r\n\r\nBoth envoys were men of the highest consideration. The marquis of\r\nBergen, by his rank and fortune, was in the first class of the Flemish\r\naristocracy.[1219] Montigny was of the ancient house of the\r\nMontmorencys, being a younger brother of the unfortunate Count Hoorne.\r\nAt the time of Charles the Fifth's abdication he had the honor of being\r\nselected by the emperor as one of those Flemish nobles who were to\r\nescort him to his monastic residence in Spain. He occupied several\r\nimportant posts,--among others, that of governor of Tournay,--and, like\r\nBergen, was a knight of the Golden Fleece. In the political disturbances\r\nof the time, although not placed in the front of disaffection, the two\r\nlords had taken part with the discontented faction, had joined in the\r\nwar upon Granvelle, and had very generally disapproved of the policy of\r\nthe crown. They had, especially, raised their voices against the system\r\nof religious persecution, with a manly independence which had secured\r\nfor them--it seems undeservedly--the reputation of being the advocates\r\nof religious reform. This was particularly the case with Bergen, who, to\r\none that asked how heretics should be dealt with, replied, \"If they were\r\nwilling to be converted, I would not trouble them. If they refused,\r\nstill I would not take their lives, as they might hereafter be\r\nconverted.\" This saying, duly reported to the ears of Philip, was\r\ndoubtless treasured up against the man who had the courage to utter\r\nit.[1220]\r\n\r\nThe purpose of their embassy was to urge on the king the necessity of a\r\nmore liberal and lenient policy, to which Margaret, who had not yet\r\nbroken with the nobles, was herself inclined. It was not strange that\r\nthe two lords should have felt the utmost reluctance to undertake a\r\nmission which was to bring them so directly within the power of the\r\nmonarch whom they knew they had offended, and who, as they also knew,\r\nwas not apt to forgive an offence. True, Egmont had gone on a similar\r\nmission to Madrid, and returned uninjured to Brussels. But it was at an\r\nearlier period, when the aspect of things was not so dangerous. His time\r\nhad not yet come.\r\n\r\nIt was not till after much delay that the other nobles, with the regent,\r\nprevailed on Bergen and Montigny to accept the trust, by urging on them\r\nits absolute importance for assuring the tranquillity of the country.\r\nEven then, an injury which confined the marquis some weeks to his house\r\nfurnished him with a plausible excuse for not performing his engagement,\r\nof which he would gladly have availed himself. But his scruples again\r\nvanished before the arguments and entreaties of his friends; and he\r\nconsented to follow, as he could not accompany, Montigny.\r\n\r\nThe latter reached Madrid towards the middle of June, 1566, was\r\ngraciously received by the king, and was admitted to repeated audiences,\r\nat which he did not fail to urge the remedial measures countenanced by\r\nMargaret. Philip appeared to listen with complacency; but declined\r\ngiving an answer till the arrival of the other ambassador, who, having\r\nalready set out on his journey, was attacked, on his way through France,\r\nby a fever. There Bergen halted, and again thought of abandoning the\r\nexpedition. His good genius seemed ever willing to interpose to save\r\nhim. But his evil genius, in the shape of Philip, who wrote to him, in\r\nthe most condescending terms, to hasten his journey, beckoned him to\r\nMadrid.[1221]\r\n\r\nBesides the two envoys there was another person of consequence from the\r\nLow Countries at that time in the capital,--Simon Renard, once Charles's\r\nminister at the English court, the inexorable foe of Granvelle. He had\r\nbeen persuaded by Philip to come to Spain, although to do so, he knew,\r\nwas to put himself on trial for his manifold offences against the\r\ngovernment. He was arrested; proceedings were commenced against him; and\r\nhe was released only by an illness which terminated in his death. There\r\nseems to have been a mysterious fascination possessed by Philip, that he\r\ncould thus draw within his reach the very men whom every motive of\r\nself-preservation should have kept at an immeasurable distance.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the marquis did not expedite the business of the mission.\r\nUnfortunately, about that period news came to Madrid of the outbreak of\r\nthe iconoclasts, exciting not merely in Spain, but throughout\r\nChristendom, feelings of horror and indignation. There was no longer a\r\nquestion as to a more temperate policy. The only thought now was of\r\nvengeance. It was in vain that the Flemish envoys interposed to mitigate\r\nthe king's anger, and turn him from those violent measures which must\r\nbring ruin on the country. Their remonstrances were unheeded. They found\r\naccess to his person by no means so easy a thing as before. They felt\r\nthat somewhat of the odium of the late transactions attached to them.\r\nEven the courtiers, with the ready instinct that detects a sovereign's\r\nfrown, grew cold in their deportment. The situation of the envoys became\r\nevery day more uncomfortable. Their mission was obviously at an end, and\r\nall they now asked was leave to return to the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nBut the king had no mind to grant it. He had been long since advised by\r\nGranvelle, and others in whom he trusted, that both the nobles had taken\r\na decided part in fostering the troubles of the country.[1222] To that\r\ncountry they were never to return. Philip told them he had need of their\r\npresence for some time longer, to advise with him on the critical state\r\nof affairs in Flanders. So thin a veil could not impose on them, and\r\nthey were idled with the most serious apprehensions. They wrote to\r\nMargaret, begging her to request the king to dismiss them; otherwise\r\nthey should have good cause to complain both of her and of the nobles,\r\nwho had sent them on a mission from which they would gladly have been\r\nexcused.[1223] But Margaret had already written to her brother to keep\r\nthem in Spain until the troubles in Flanders should be ended.[1224] On\r\nthe reception of the letter of her envoys, however, she replied that she\r\nhad already written to the king to request leave for them to\r\nreturn.[1225] I have found no record of such a letter.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1567, the duke of Alva was sent to take command of the\r\nNetherlands. Such an appointment, at such a crisis, plainly intimated\r\nthe course to be pursued, and the host of evils it would soon bring on\r\nthe devoted country. The conviction of this was too much for Bergen,\r\nheightened as his distress was by his separation, at such a moment, from\r\nall that was most dear to him on earth. He fell ill of a fever, and grew\r\nrapidly worse, till at length, it was reported to Philip that there was\r\nno chance for his recovery unless he were allowed to return to his\r\nnative land.[1226]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEATH OF BERGEN.]\r\n\r\nThis placed the king in a perplexing dilemma. He was not disposed to let\r\nthe marquis escape from his hands even by the way of a natural death. He\r\nwas still less inclined to assent to his return to Flanders. In this\r\nemergency he directed Ruy Gomez, the prince of Eboli, to visit the sick\r\nnobleman, who was his personal friend. In case Gomez found the marquis\r\nso ill that his recovery was next to impossible, he was to give him the\r\nking's permission to return home. If, however, there seemed a prospect\r\nof his recovery, he was only to hold out the hope of such a\r\npermission.[1227] In case of the sick man's death, Gomez was to take\r\ncare to have his obsequies performed in such a manner as to show the\r\nsorrow of the king and his ministers at his loss, and their respect for\r\nthe lords of the Low Countries![1228] He was, moreover, in that event,\r\nto take means to have the marquis's property in the Netherlands\r\nsequestered, as, should rebellion be proved against him, it would be\r\nforfeited to the crown.--This curious, and, as it must be allowed,\r\nhighly confidential epistle, was written with the king's own hand. The\r\naddress ran, \"Ruy Gomez--to his hands. Not to be opened nor read in the\r\npresence of the bearer.\"\r\n\r\nWhich part of the royal instruction the minister thought best to follow\r\nfor the cure of the patient,--whether he gave him an unconditional\r\npermission to return, or only held out the hope that he would do so,--we\r\nare not informed. It matters little, however. The marquis, it is\r\nprobable, had already learned not to put his trust in princes. At all\r\nevents, the promises of the king did as little for the patient as the\r\nprescriptions of the doctor. On the twenty-first of May he\r\ndied,--justifying the melancholy presentiment with which he had entered\r\non his mission.\r\n\r\nMontigny was the only victim that now remained to Philip; and he caused\r\nhim to be guarded with redoubled vigilance. He directed Ruy Gomez to\r\nkeep an eye on all his movements, and to write to the governors of\r\nNavarre, Catalonia, and other frontier places, to take precautions to\r\nintercept the Flemish lord, in case of his attempting to fly the\r\ncountry.[1229] Montigny was in fact a prisoner, with Madrid for the\r\nlimits of his prison. Yet, after this, the regent could write to him\r\nfrom Brussels, that she was pleased to learn from her brother that he\r\nwas soon to give him his _congé_.[1230]--If the king said this, he had a\r\nbitter meaning in his words, beyond what the duchess apprehended.\r\n\r\nIt was not long, however, that Montigny was allowed to retain even this\r\ndegree of liberty. In September, 1567, arrived the tidings of the arrest\r\nof the Counts Egmont and Hoorne. Orders were instantly issued for the\r\narrest of Montigny. He was seized by a detachment of the royal guard,\r\nand borne off to the alcazar of Segovia.[1231] He was not to be allowed\r\nto leave the fortress day or night; but as much indulgence was shown to\r\nhim as was compatible with this strict confinement; and he was permitted\r\nto take with him the various retainers who composed his household, and\r\nto maintain his establishment in prison. But what indulgence could\r\nsoften the bitterness of a captivity far from kindred and country, with\r\nthe consciousness, moreover, that the only avenue from his prison\r\nconducted to the scaffold!\r\n\r\nIn his extremity, Montigny looked around for the means of effecting his\r\nown escape; and he nearly succeeded. One, if not more, of the Spaniards\r\non guard, together with his own servants, were in the plot. It was\r\narranged that the prisoner should file through the bars of a window in\r\nhis apartment, and lower himself to the ground by means of a rope\r\nladder. Relays of horses were provided to take him rapidly on to the\r\nseaport of Santander, in the north, whence he was to be transported in a\r\nshallop to St. Jean de Luz. The materials for executing his part of the\r\nwork were conveyed to Montigny in the loaves of bread daily sent to him\r\nby his baker. Everything seemed to promise success. The bars of the\r\nwindow were removed.[1232] They waited only for a day when the alcayde\r\nof the castle would not be likely to visit it. At this juncture the plot\r\nwas discovered through the carelessness of the _maître d'hôtel_.\r\n\r\nThis person neglected to send one of the loaves to his master, which\r\ncontained a paper giving sundry directions respecting the mode of\r\nescape, and mentioning the names of several of the parties. The loaf\r\nfell into the hands of a soldier.[1233] On breaking it, the paper was\r\ndiscovered, and taken by him to the captain of the guard. The plot was\r\nlaid open; the parties were arrested, and sentenced to death or the\r\ngalleys. The king allowed the sentence to take effect in regard to the\r\nSpaniards. He granted a reprieve to the Flemings, saying that what they\r\nhad done was in some sort excusable, as being for the service of their\r\nmaster. Besides, they might be of use hereafter, in furnishing testimony\r\nin the prosecution of Montigny.[1234] On this compound principle their\r\nlives were spared. After languishing some time in prison, they were\r\nallowed to return to the Low Countries, bearing with them letters from\r\nMontigny, requesting his friends to provide for them in consideration of\r\ntheir sacrifices for him. But they were provided for in a much more\r\nsummary manner by Alva, who, on their landing, caused them to be\r\nimmediately arrested, and banished them all from the country, under pain\r\nof death if they returned to it![1235]\r\n\r\nThe greatest sympathy was felt for Montigny in the Netherlands, where\r\nthe nobles were filled with indignation at the unworthy treatment their\r\nenvoy had received from Philip. His step-mother, the dowager-countess of\r\nHoorne, was as untiring in her efforts for him as she had been for his\r\nunfortunate brother. These were warmly seconded by his wife, a daughter\r\nof the prince of Epinoy, to whom Montigny had been married but a short\r\ntime before his mission to Spain. This lady wrote a letter in the most\r\nhumble tone of supplication to Philip. She touched on the blight brought\r\non her domestic happiness, spoke with a strong conviction of the\r\ninnocence of Montigny, and with tears and lamentations implored the\r\nking, by the consideration of his past services, by the passion of the\r\nblessed Saviour, to show mercy to her husband.[1236]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS PROCESS.]\r\n\r\nSeveral months elapsed, after the execution of the Counts Egmont and\r\nHoorne, before the duke commenced proceedings against Montigny; and it\r\nwas not till February, 1569, that the licentiate Salazar, one of the\r\nroyal council, was sent to Segovia in order to interrogate the prisoner.\r\nThe charges were of the same nature with those brought against Egmont\r\nand Hoorne. Montigny at first, like them, refused to make any\r\nreply,--standing on his rights as a member of the Golden Fleece. He was,\r\nhowever, after a formal protest, prevailed on to waive this privilege.\r\nThe examination continued several days. The various documents connected\r\nwith it are still preserved in the Archives of Simancas. M. Gachard has\r\ngiven no abstract of their contents. But that sagacious inquirer, after\r\na careful perusal of the papers, pronounces Montigny's answers to be \"a\r\nvictorious refutation of the charges of the attorney-general.\"[1237]\r\n\r\nIt was not a refutation that Philip or his viceroy wanted. Montigny was\r\ninstantly required to appoint some one to act as counsel in his behalf.\r\nBut no one was willing to undertake the business, till a person of\r\nlittle note at length consented, or was rather compelled to undertake it\r\nby the menaces of Alva.[1238] Any man might well have felt a\r\ndisinclination for an office which must expose him to the ill-will of\r\nthe government, with little chance of benefit to his client.\r\n\r\nEven after this, Montigny was allowed to languish another year in prison\r\nbefore sentence was passed on him by his judges. The proceedings of the\r\nCouncil of Blood on this occasion were marked by a more flagitious\r\ncontempt of justice, if possible, than its proceedings usually were. The\r\nduke, in a letter of the eighteenth of March, 1570, informed the king of\r\nthe particulars of the trial. He had submitted the case, not to the\r\nwhole court, but to a certain number of the councillors, _selected by\r\nhim for the purpose_.[1239] He does not tell on what principle the\r\nselection was made. Philip could readily divine it. In the judgment of\r\nthe majority, Montigny was found guilty of high treason. The duke\r\naccordingly passed sentence of death on him. The sentence was dated\r\nMarch 4, 1570. It was precisely of the same import with the sentences of\r\nEgmont and Hoorne. It commanded that Montigny be taken from prison, and\r\npublicly beheaded with a sword. His head was to be stuck on a pole,\r\nthere to remain during the pleasure of his majesty. His goods and\r\nestates were to be confiscated to the crown.[1240]\r\n\r\nThe sentence was not communicated even to the Council of Blood. The only\r\npersons aware of its existence were the duke's secretary and his two\r\ntrusty councillors, Vargas and Del Rio. Alva had kept it thus secret\r\nuntil he should learn the will of his master.[1241] At the same time he\r\nintimated to Philip that he might think it better to have the execution\r\ntake place in Castile, as under existing circumstances more eligible\r\nthan the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nPhilip was in Andalusia, making a tour in the southern provinces, when\r\nthe despatches of his viceroy reached him. He was not altogether pleased\r\nwith their tenor. Not that he had any misgivings in regard to the\r\nsentence; for he was entirely satisfied, as he wrote to Alva, of\r\nMontigny's guilt.[1242] But he did not approve of a public execution.\r\nEnough blood, it might be thought in the Netherlands, had been already\r\nspilt; and men there might complain that, shut up in a foreign prison\r\nduring his trial, Montigny had not met with justice.[1243] There were\r\ncertainly some grounds for such a complaint.\r\n\r\nPhilip resolved to defer taking any decisive step in the matter till his\r\nreturn to the north. Meanwhile he commended Alva's discretion in keeping\r\nthe sentence secret, and charged him on no account to divulge it, even\r\nto members of the council.\r\n\r\nSome months elapsed after the king's return to Madrid before he came to\r\na decision,--exhibiting the procrastination, so conspicuous a trait in\r\nhim, even among a people with whom procrastination was no miracle. It\r\nmay have been that he was too much occupied with an interesting affair\r\nwhich pressed on him at that moment. About two years before, Philip had\r\nhad the misfortune to lose his young and beautiful queen, Isabella of\r\nthe Peace. Her place was now to be supplied by a German princess, Anne\r\nof Austria, his fourth wife, still younger than the one he had lost. She\r\nwas already on her way to Castile; and the king may have been too much\r\nengrossed by his preparations for the nuptial festivities, to have much\r\nthought to bestow on the concerns of his wretched prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe problem to be solved was how to carry the sentence into effect, and\r\nyet leave the impression on the public that Montigny died a natural\r\ndeath. Most of the few ministers whom the king took into his confidence\r\non the occasion were of opinion that it would be best to bring the\r\nprisoner's death about by means of a slow poison administered in his\r\ndrink, or some article of his daily food. This would give him time,\r\nmoreover, to provide for the concerns of his soul.[1244] But Philip\r\nobjected to this, as not fulfilling what he was pleased to call the ends\r\nof justice.[1245] He at last decided on the _garrote_,--the form of\r\nexecution used for the meaner sort of criminals in Spain, but which,\r\nproducing death by suffocation, would be less likely to leave its traces\r\non the body.[1246]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CLOSER CONFINEMENT.]\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, it would be necessary to remove Montigny from the\r\ntown of Segovia, the gay residence of the court, and soon to be the\r\nscene of the wedding ceremonies, to some more remote and less frequented\r\nspot. Simancas was accordingly selected, whose stern, secluded fortress\r\nseemed to be a fitting place for the perpetration of such a deed. The\r\nfortress was of great strength, and was encompassed by massive walls,\r\nand a wide moat, across which two bridges gave access to the interior.\r\nIt was anciently used as a prison for state criminals. Cardinal Ximenes\r\nfirst conceived the idea of turning it to the nobler purpose of\r\npreserving the public archives.[1247] Charles the Fifth carried this\r\nenlightened project into execution; but it was not fully consummated\r\ntill the time of Philip, who prescribed the regulations, and made all\r\nthe necessary arrangements for placing the institution on a permanent\r\nbasis,--thus securing to future historians the best means for guiding\r\ntheir steps through the dark and tortuous passages of his reign. But\r\neven after this change in its destination, the fortress of Simancas\r\ncontinued to be used occasionally as a place of confinement for\r\nprisoners of state. The famous bishop of Zamora, who took so active a\r\npart in the war of the _comunidades_, was there strangled by command of\r\nCharles the Fifth. The quarter of the building in which he suffered is\r\nstill known by the name of \"_el cubo del obispo_,\"--\"The Bishop's\r\nTower.\"[1248]\r\n\r\nTo this strong place Montigny was removed from Segovia, on the\r\nnineteenth of August, 1570, under a numerous guard of alguazils and\r\narquebusiers. For greater security he was put in irons,--a superfluous\r\npiece of cruelty, from which Philip, in a letter to Alva, thought it\r\nnecessary to vindicate himself, as having been done without his\r\norders.[1249] We might well imagine that the last ray of hope must have\r\nfaded away in Montigny's bosom, as he entered the gloomy portals of his\r\nnew abode. Yet hope, as we are assured, did not altogether desert him.\r\nHe had learned that Anne of Austria had expressed much sympathy for his\r\nsufferings. It was but natural that the daughter of the emperor\r\nMaximilian should take an interest in the persecuted people of the\r\nNetherlands. It was even said that she promised the wife and step-mother\r\nof Montigny to make his liberation the first boon she would ask of her\r\nhusband on coming to Castile.[1250] And Montigny cherished the fond hope\r\nthat the influence of the young bride would turn the king from his\r\npurpose, and that her coming to Castile would be the signal for his\r\nliberation. That Anne should have yielded to such an illusion is not so\r\nstrange, for she had never seen Philip; but that Montigny should have\r\nbeen beguiled by it is more difficult to understand.\r\n\r\nIn his new quarters he was treated with a show of respect, if not\r\nindulgence. He was even allowed some privileges. Though the guards were\r\ndoubled over him, he was permitted to have his own servants, and, when\r\nit suited him, to take the fresh air and sunshine in the corridor.\r\n\r\nEarly in October the young Austrian princess landed on the northern\r\nshores of the kingdom, at Santander. The tidings of this may have\r\ninduced the king to quicken his movements in regard to his prisoner,\r\nwilling perhaps to relieve himself of all chance of importunity from his\r\nbride, as well as from the awkwardness of refusing the first favor she\r\nshould request. As a preliminary step, it would be necessary to abridge\r\nthe liberty which Montigny at present enjoyed, to confine him to his\r\napartment, and cutting off his communications even with those in the\r\ncastle, to spread the rumor of his illness, which should prepare the\r\nminds of the public for a fatal issue.\r\n\r\nTo furnish an apology for his close confinement, a story was got up of\r\nan attempt to escape, similar to what had actually occurred at Segovia.\r\nPeralta, alcayde of the fortress, a trustworthy vassal, to whom was\r\ncommitted the direction of the affair, addressed a letter to the king,\r\ninclosing a note in Latin, which he pretended had been found under\r\nMontigny's window, containing sundry directions for his flight. The fact\r\nof such a design, the writer said, was corroborated by the appearance of\r\ncertain persons in the disguise of friars about the castle. The\r\ngovernor, in consequence, had been obliged to remove his prisoner to\r\nother quarters, of greater security. He was accordingly lodged in the\r\nBishop's Tower,--ominous quarters!--where he was no longer allowed the\r\nattendance of his own domestics, but placed in strict confinement.\r\nMontigny had taken this proceeding so ill, and with such vehement\r\ncomplaints of its injustice, that it had brought on a fever, under which\r\nhe was now laboring. Peralta concluded by expressing his regret at being\r\nforced by Montigny's conduct into a course so painful to himself, as he\r\nwould gladly have allowed him all the indulgence compatible with his own\r\nhonor.[1251]--This letter, which had all been concocted in the cabinet\r\nat Madrid, was shown openly at court. It gained easier credit from the\r\nfact of Montigny's former attempt to escape; and the rumor went abroad\r\nthat he was now lying dangerously ill.\r\n\r\nEarly in October, the licentiate Alonzo de Arellano had been summoned\r\nfrom Seville, and installed in the office of alcalde of the chancery of\r\nValladolid, distant only two leagues from Simancas. Arellano was a\r\nperson in whose discretion and devotion to himself Philip knew he could\r\nconfide; and to him he now intrusted the execution of Montigny.\r\nDirections for the course he was to take, as well as the precautions he\r\nwas to use to prevent suspicion, were set down in the royal instructions\r\nwith great minuteness. They must be allowed to form a remarkable\r\ndocument, such as has rarely proceeded from a royal pen. The alcalde was\r\nto pass to Simancas, and take with him a notary, an executioner, and a\r\npriest. The last should be a man of undoubted piety and learning,\r\ncapable of dispelling any doubts or errors that might unhappily have\r\narisen in Montigny's mind in respect to the faith. Such a man appeared\r\nto be Fray Hernando del Castillo, of the order of St. Dominic, in\r\nValladolid; and no better person could have been chosen, nor one more\r\nopen to those feelings of humanity which are not always found under the\r\nrobe of the friar.[1252]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS LAST MOMENTS.]\r\n\r\nAttended by these three persons, the alcalde left Valladolid soon after\r\nnightfall on the evening of the fourteenth of October. Peralta had been\r\nadvised of his coming; and the little company were admitted into the\r\ncastle so cautiously as to attract no observation. The governor and the\r\njudge at once proceeded to Montigny's apartment, where they found the\r\nunhappy man lying on his pallet, ill not so much of the fever that was\r\ntalked of, as of that sickness of the heart which springs from hope\r\ndeferred. When informed of his sentence by Arellano, in words as kind as\r\nso cruel a communication would permit, he was wholly overcome by it, and\r\nfor some time continued in a state of pitiable agitation. Yet one might\r\nhave thought that the warnings he had already received were such as\r\nmight have prepared his mind in some degree for the blow. For he seems\r\nto have been in the condition of the tenant of one of those\r\ninquisitorial cells in Venice, the walls of which, we are told, were so\r\nconstructed as to approach each other gradually every day, until the\r\nwretched inmate was crushed between them. After Montigny had\r\nsufficiently recovered from his agitation to give heed to it, the\r\nsentence was read to him by the notary. He was still to be allowed a\r\nday before the execution, in order to gain time, as Philip had said, to\r\nsettle his affairs with Heaven. And although, as the alcalde added, the\r\nsentence passed on him was held by the king as a just sentence, yet, in\r\nconsideration of his quality, his majesty, purely out of his benignity\r\nand clemency, was willing so far to mitigate it, in regard to the form,\r\nas to allow him to be executed, not in public, but in secret, thus\r\nsaving his honor, and suggesting the idea of his having come to his end\r\nby a natural death.[1253] For this act of grace Montigny seems to have\r\nbeen duly grateful. How true were the motives assigned for it, the\r\nreader can determine.\r\n\r\nHaving thus discharged their painful office, Arellano and the governor\r\nwithdrew, and, summoning the friar, left the prisoner to the spiritual\r\nconsolations he so much needed. What followed, we have from Castillo\r\nhimself. As Montigny's agitation subsided, he listened patiently to the\r\nexhortations of the good father; and when at length restored to\r\nsomething like his natural composure, he joined with him earnestly in\r\nprayer. He then confessed and received the sacrament, seeming desirous\r\nof employing the brief space that yet remained to him in preparation for\r\nthe solemn change. At intervals, when not actually occupied with his\r\ndevotions, he read the compositions of Father Luis de Granada, whose\r\nspiritualized conceptions had often solaced the hours of his captivity.\r\n\r\nMontigny was greatly disturbed by the rumor of his having been shaken in\r\nhis religious principles, and having embraced the errors of the\r\nReformers. To correct this impression, he briefly drew up, with his own\r\nhand, a confession of faith, in which he avows as implicit a belief in\r\nall the articles sanctioned by the Roman Catholic Church, and its head,\r\nthe Vicar of Christ, as Pius the Fifth himself could have desired.[1254]\r\nHaving thus relieved his mind, Montigny turned to settle some temporal\r\naffairs which he was desirous to settle. They did not occupy much time.\r\nFor, as Philip had truly remarked, there was no occasion for him to make\r\na will, since he had nothing to bequeath,--all his property having been\r\nconfiscated to the crown.[1255] If, however, any debt pressed heavily on\r\nhis conscience, he was to be allowed to indicate it, as well as any\r\nprovision which he particularly desired to make for a special purpose.\r\nThis was on the condition, however, that he should allude to himself as\r\nabout to die a natural death.[1256]\r\n\r\nMontigny profited by this to express the wish that masses, to the number\r\nof seven hundred, might be said for his soul, that sundry sums might be\r\nappropriated to private uses, and that some gratuities might be given to\r\ncertain of his faithful followers. It may interest the reader to know\r\nthat the masses were punctually performed. In regard to the pious\r\nlegacies, the king wrote to Alva, he must first see if Montigny's estate\r\nwould justify the appropriation; as for the gratuities to servants,\r\nthey were wholly out of the question.[1257]\r\n\r\nOne token of remembrance, which he placed in the hands of Castillo,\r\ndoubtless reached its destination. This was a gold chain of delicate\r\nworkmanship, with a seal or signet ring attached to it, bearing his\r\narms. This little token he requested might be given to his wife. It had\r\nbeen his constant companion ever since they were married; and he wished\r\nher to wear it in memory of him,--expressing at the same time his regret\r\nthat a longer life had not been granted him, to serve and honor her. As\r\na dying injunction he besought her not to be entangled by the new\r\ndoctrines, or to swerve from the faith of her ancestors.--If ever\r\nMontigny had a leaning to the doctrines of the Reformation, it could\r\nhardly have deepened into conviction; for early habit and education\r\nreasserted their power so entirely, at this solemn moment, that the\r\nDominican by his side declared that he gave evidence of being as good\r\nand Catholic a Christian as he could wish to be himself.[1258] The few\r\nhours in which Montigny had thus tasted of the bitterness of death\r\nseemed to have done more to wean him from the vanities of life than the\r\nwhole years of dreary imprisonment he had passed within the walls of\r\nSegovia and Simancas. Yet we shall hardly credit the friar's assertion,\r\nthat he carried his resignation so far, that, though insisting on his\r\nown innocence, he admitted the sentence of his judges to be just![1259]\r\n\r\nAt about two o'clock on the morning of the sixteenth of October, when\r\nthe interval allowed for this solemn preparation had expired, Father\r\nCastillo waited on the governor and the alcalde, to inform them that the\r\nhour had come, and that their prisoner was ready to receive them. They\r\nwent, without further delay, to the chamber of death, attended by the\r\nnotary and the executioner. Then, in their presence, while the notary\r\nmade a record of the proceedings, the grim minister of the law did his\r\nwork on his unresisting victim.[1260]\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the breath out of the body of Montigny, than the alcalde,\r\nthe priest, and their two companions were on their way back to\r\nValladolid, reaching it before dawn, so as to escape the notice of the\r\ninhabitants. All were solemnly bound to secrecy in regard to the dark\r\nact in which they had been engaged. The notary and the hangman were\r\nstill further secured by the menace of death, in case they betrayed any\r\nknowledge of the matter; and they knew full well that Philip was not a\r\nman to shrink from the execution of his menaces.[1261]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS LAST MOMENTS.]\r\n\r\nThe corpse was arrayed in a Franciscan habit, which, coming up to the\r\nthroat, left the face only exposed to observation. It was thus seen by\r\nMontigny's servants, who recognised the features of their master, hardly\r\nmore distorted than sometimes happens from disease, when the agonies of\r\ndeath have left their traces. The story went abroad that their lord had\r\ndied of the fever with which he had been so violently attacked.\r\n\r\nThe funeral obsequies were performed, according to the royal orders,\r\nwith all due solemnity. The vicar and beneficiaries of the church of St.\r\nSaviour officiated on the occasion. The servants of the deceased were\r\nclad in mourning,--a token of respect recommended by Philip, who\r\nremarked, the servants were so few, that mourning might as well be given\r\nto them;[1262] and he was willing to take charge of this and the other\r\nexpenses of the funeral, provided Montigny had not left money sufficient\r\nfor the purpose. The place selected for his burial was a vault under one\r\nof the chapels of the building; and a decent monument indicated the spot\r\nwhere reposed the ashes of the last of the envoys who came from Flanders\r\non the ill-starred mission to Madrid.[1263]\r\n\r\nSuch is a true account of this tragical affair, as derived from the\r\nking's own letters and those of his agents. Far different was the story\r\nput in circulation at the time. On the seventeenth of October, the day\r\nafter Montigny's death, despatches were received at court from Peralta,\r\nthe alcayde of the fortress. They stated that, after writing his former\r\nletter, his prisoner's fever had so much increased, that he had called\r\nin the aid of a physician; and as the symptoms became more alarming, the\r\nlatter had entered into a consultation with the medical adviser of the\r\nlate regent, Joanna, so that nothing that human skill could afford\r\nshould be wanting to the patient. He grew rapidly worse, however, and\r\nas, happily, Father Hernando del Castillo, of Valladolid, chanced to be\r\nthen in Simancas, he came and administered the last consolations of\r\nreligion to the dying man. Having done all that a good Christian at such\r\na time should do, Montigny expired early on the morning of the\r\nsixteenth, manifesting at the last so Catholic a spirit, that good hopes\r\nmight be entertained of his salvation.[1264]\r\n\r\nThis hypocritical epistle, it is hardly necessary to say, like the one\r\nthat preceded it, had been manufactured at Madrid. Nor was it altogether\r\ndevoid of truth. The physician of the place, named Viana, had been\r\ncalled in; and it was found necessary to intrust him with the secret.\r\nEvery day he paid his visit to the castle, and every day returned with\r\nmore alarming accounts of the condition of the patient; and thus the\r\nminds of the community were prepared for the fatal termination of his\r\ndisorder. Not that, after all, this was unattended with suspicions of\r\nfoul play in the matter, as people reflected how opportune was the\r\noccurrence of such an event. But suspicions were not proof. The secret\r\nwas too well guarded for any one to penetrate the veil of mystery; and\r\nthe few who were behind that veil loved their lives too well to raise\r\nit.\r\n\r\nDespatches written in cipher, and containing a full and true account of\r\nthe affair, were sent to the duke of Alva. The two letters of Peralta,\r\nwhich indeed were intended for the meridian of Brussels rather than of\r\nMadrid, were forwarded with them. The duke was told to show them\r\nincidentally, as it were, without obtruding them on any one's\r\nnotice,[1265] that Montigny's friends in the Netherlands might be\r\nsatisfied of their truth.\r\n\r\nIn his own private communication to Alva, Philip, in mentioning the\r\northodox spirit manifested by his victim in his last moments, shows that\r\nwith the satisfaction which he usually expressed on such occasions was\r\nmingled some degree of scepticism. \"If his inner man,\" he writes of\r\nMontigny, \"was penetrated with as Christian a spirit as he exhibited in\r\nthe outer, and as the friar who confessed him has reported, God, we may\r\npresume, will have mercy on his soul.\"[1266] In the original draft of\r\nthe letter, as prepared by the king's secretary, it is further added:\r\n\"Yet, after all, who can tell but this was a delusion of Satan, who, as\r\nwe know, never deserts the heretic in his dying hour.\" This sentence--as\r\nappears from the manuscript still preserved in Simancas--was struck out\r\nby Philip, with the remark in his own hand, \"Omit this, as we should\r\nthink no evil of the dead!\"[1267]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this magnanimous sentiment, Philip lost no time in\r\npublishing Montigny to the world as a traitor, and demanding the\r\nconfiscation of his estates. The Council of Blood learned a good lesson\r\nfrom the Holy Inquisition, which took care that even Death should not\r\ndefraud it of its victims. Proceedings were instituted against the\r\n_memory_ of Montigny, as had before been done against the memory of the\r\nmarquis of Bergen.[1268] On the twenty-second of March, 1571, the duke\r\nof Alva pronounced sentence, condemning the memory of Florence de\r\nMontmorency, lord of Montigny, as guilty of high treason, and\r\nconfiscating his goods and estates to the use of the crown; \"it having\r\ncome to his knowledge,\" the instrument went on to say, \"that the said\r\nMontigny had deceased by natural death in the fortress of Simancas,\r\nwhere he had of late been held a prisoner!\"[1269]\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the Council of Blood against Montigny were\r\ncharacterized, as I have already said, by greater effrontery and a more\r\nflagrant contempt of the common forms of justice than were usually to be\r\nmet with even in that tribunal. A bare statement of the facts is\r\nsufficient. The party accused was put on his trial--if trial it can be\r\ncalled--in one country, while he was held in close custody in another.\r\nThe court before which he was tried--or rather the jury, for the council\r\nseems to have exercised more of the powers of a jury than of a\r\njudge--was on this occasion a packed body, selected to suit the purposes\r\nof the prosecution. Its sentence, instead of being publicly pronounced,\r\nwas confided only to the party interested to obtain it,--the king. Even\r\nthe sentence itself was not the one carried into effect; but another was\r\nsubstituted in its place, and a public execution was supplanted by a\r\nmidnight assassination. It would be an abuse of language to dignify such\r\na proceeding with the title of a judicial murder.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NOTICE OF GACHARD.]\r\n\r\nYet Philip showed no misgivings as to his own course in the matter. He\r\nhad made up his mind as to the guilt of Montigny. He had been false to\r\nhis king and false to his religion; offences which death only could\r\nexpiate. Still we find Philip resorting to a secret execution, although\r\nAlva, as we have seen, had supposed that sentence was to be executed on\r\nMontigny in the same open manner as it had been on the other victims of\r\nthe bloody tribunal. But the king shrunk from exposing a deed to the\r\npublic eye, which, independently of its atrocity in other respects,\r\ninvolved so flagrant a violation of good faith towards the party who had\r\ncome, at his sovereign's own desire, on a public mission to Madrid. With\r\nthis regard to the opinions of his own age, it may seem strange that\r\nPhilip should not have endeavored to efface every vestige of his\r\nconnection with the act, by destroying the records which established it.\r\nOn the contrary, he not only took care that such records should be made,\r\nbut caused them, and all other evidence of the affair, to be permanently\r\npreserved in the national archives. There they lay for the inspection of\r\nposterity, which was one day to sit in judgment on his conduct.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the part of this History which relates to the Netherlands, I have\r\nbeen greatly indebted to two eminent scholars of that country. The first\r\nof these, M. Gachard, who had the care of the royal archives of Belgium,\r\nwas commissioned by his government, in 1844, to visit the Peninsula for\r\nthe purpose of collecting materials for the illustration of the national\r\nhistory. The most important theatre of his labors was Simancas, which,\r\ntill the time of his visit, had been carefully closed to natives as well\r\nas foreigners. M. Gachard profited by the more liberal arrangements\r\nwhich, under certain restrictions, opened its historical treasures to\r\nthe student. The result of his labors he is now giving to the world by\r\nthe publication of his \"Correspondance de Philippe II.,\" of which two\r\nvolumes have already been printed. The work is published in a beautiful\r\nform, worthy of the auspices under which it has appeared. It consists\r\nchiefly of the correspondence carried on by the Spanish government and\r\nthe authorities of the Netherlands in the reign of Philip the\r\nSecond,--the revolutionary age, and of course the most eventful period\r\nof their history. The official despatches, written in French, are, it is\r\ntrue, no longer to be found in Simancas, whence they were removed to\r\nBrussels on the accession of Albert and Isabella to the sovereignty of\r\nthe Low Countries. But a large mass of correspondence which passed\r\nbetween the court of Castile and the Netherlands, is still preserved in\r\nthe Spanish archives. As it is, for the most part, of a confidential\r\nnature, containing strictures on men and things intended only for the\r\neyes of the parties to it, it is of infinite value to the historian. Not\r\nonly has it never before been published, but, with the exception of a\r\nportion which passed under the review of the Italian Strada, it has\r\nnever been submitted to the inspection of the scholar. With the aid of\r\nthis rich collection, the historian is enabled to enter into many\r\ndetails, hitherto unknown, of a personal nature, relating to the actors\r\nin the great drama of the revolution, as well as to disclose some of the\r\nsecret springs of their policy.\r\n\r\nM. Gachard has performed his editorial duties with conscientiousness and\r\nability. In a subsequent volume he proposes to give the entire text of\r\nthe more important letters; but in the two already published he has\r\nconfined himself to an analysis of their contents, more or less\r\nextended, according to circumstances. He has added explanatory notes,\r\nand prefixed to the whole a copious dissertation, presenting a view of\r\nthe politics of the Castilian court, and of the characters of the king\r\nand the great officers of state. As the writer's information is derived\r\nfrom sources the most authentic as well as the least accessible to\r\nscholars, his preliminary essay deserves to be carefully studied by the\r\nhistorian of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nM. Gachard has further claims to the gratitude of every lover of letters\r\nby various contributions in other forms which he has made to the\r\nillustration of the national history. Among these his \"Correspondance de\r\nGuillaume le Taciturne,\" of which three volumes in octavo have already\r\nappeared, has been freely used by me. It consists of a collection of\r\nWilliam's correspondence, industriously gathered from various quarters.\r\nThe letters differ from one another as widely in value as might\r\nnaturally be expected in so large and miscellaneous a collection.\r\n\r\nThe other scholar by whose editorial labors I have profited in this part\r\nof my work is M. Groen van Prinsterer. His voluminous publication,\r\n\"Archives de la Maison d'Orange-Nassau,\" the first series of which\r\nembraces the times of William the Silent, is derived from the private\r\ncollection of the king of Holland. The contents are various, but consist\r\nchiefly of letters from persons who took a prominent part in the conduct\r\nof affairs. Their correspondence embraces a miscellaneous range of\r\ntopics, and with those of public interest combines others strictly\r\npersonal in their details, thus bringing into strong relief the\r\ncharacters of the most eminent actors on the great political theatre. A\r\nliving interest attaches to this correspondence, which we shall look for\r\nin vain in the colder pages of the historian. History gives us the acts,\r\nbut letters like these, in which the actors speak for themselves, give\r\nus the thoughts, of the individual.\r\n\r\nM. Groen has done his part of the work well, adhering to the original\r\ntext with scrupulous fidelity, and presenting us the letters in the\r\nvarious languages in which they were written. The interstices, so to\r\nspeak, between the different parts of the correspondence, are skilfully\r\nfilled up by the editor, so as to connect the incongruous materials into\r\na well compacted fabric. In conducting what, as far as he is concerned,\r\nmay be termed the original part of his work, the editor has shown much\r\ndiscretion, gathering information from collateral contemporary sources;\r\nand, by the side-lights he has thus thrown over the path, has greatly\r\nfacilitated the progress of the student, and enabled him to take a\r\nsurvey of the whole historical ground. The editor is at no pains to\r\nconceal his own opinions; and we have no difficulty in determining the\r\nreligious sect to which he belongs. But it is not the less true, that he\r\nis ready to render justice to the opinions of others, and that he is\r\nentitled to the praise of having executed his task with impartiality.\r\n\r\nOne may notice a peculiarity in the criticisms of both Groen and\r\nGachard, the more remarkable considering the nations to which they\r\nbelong; that is, the solicitude they manifest to place the most\r\nfavorable construction on the conduct of Philip, and to vindicate his\r\nmemory from the wholesale charges so often brought against him, of a\r\nsystematic attempt to overturn the liberties of the Netherlands. The\r\nreader, even should he not always feel the cogency of their arguments,\r\nwill not refuse his admiration to the candor of the critics.\r\n\r\nThere is a third publication, recently issued from the press in\r\nBrussels, which contains, in the compass of a single volume, materials\r\nof much importance for the history of the Netherlands. This is the\r\n\"Correspondance de Marguerite d'Autriche,\" by the late Baron\r\nReiffenberg. It is a part of the French correspondence which, as I have\r\nmentioned above, was transferred, in the latter part of Philip the\r\nSecond's reign, from Simancas to Brussels; but which, instead of\r\nremaining there, was removed, after the country had passed under the\r\nAustrian sceptre, to the imperial library of Vienna, where it exists, in\r\nall probability, at the present day. Some fragments of this\r\ncorrespondence escaped the fate which attended the bulk of it; and it is\r\ngleanings from these which Reiffenberg has given to the world.\r\n\r\nThat country is fortunate which can command the services of such men as\r\nthese for the illustration of its national annals,--men who with\r\nsingular enthusiasm for their task combine the higher qualifications of\r\nscholarship, and a talent for critical analysis. By their persevering\r\nlabors the rich ore has been drawn from the mines where it had lain in\r\ndarkness for ages. It now waits only for the hand of the artist to\r\nconvert it into coin, and give it a popular currency.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONDITION OF TURKEY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE OTTOMAN EMPIRE.\r\n\r\nCondition of Turkey.--African Corsairs.--Expedition against\r\nTripoli.--War on the Barbary Coast.\r\n\r\n1559-1563.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two methods of writing history;--one by following down the\r\nstream of time, and exhibiting events in their chronological order; the\r\nother by disposing of these events according to their subjects. The\r\nformer is the most obvious; and where the action is simple and\r\ncontinuous, as in biography, for the most part, or in the narrative of\r\nsome grand historical event, which concentrates the interest, it is\r\nprobably the best. But when the story is more complicated, covering a\r\nwide field, and embracing great variety of incident, the chronological\r\nsystem, however easy for the writer, becomes tedious and unprofitable to\r\nthe reader. He is hurried along from one scene to another without fully\r\napprehending any; and as the thread of the narrative is perpetually\r\nbroken by sudden transition, he carries off only such scraps in his\r\nmemory as it is hardly possible to weave into a connected and consistent\r\nwhole. Yet this method, as the most simple and natural, is one most\r\naffected by the early writers,--by the old Castilian chroniclers more\r\nparticularly, who form the principal authorities in the present work.\r\nTheir wearisome pages, mindful of no order but that of time, are spread\r\nover as miscellaneous a range of incidents, and having as little\r\nrelation to one another, as the columns of a newspaper.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this inconvenience, historians of a later period have preferred\r\nto conduct their story on more philosophical principles, having regard\r\nrather to the nature of the events described, than to the precise time\r\nof their occurrence. And thus the reader, possessed of one action, its\r\ncauses and its consequences, before passing on to another, is enabled to\r\ntreasure up in his memory distinct impressions of the whole.\r\n\r\nIn conformity to this plan, I have detained the reader in the\r\nNetherlands until he had seen the close of Margaret's administration,\r\nand the policy which marked the commencement of her successor's. During\r\nthis period, Spain was at peace with her European neighbors, most of\r\nwhom were too much occupied with their domestic dissensions to have\r\nleisure for foreign war. France, in particular, was convulsed by\r\nreligious feuds, in which Philip, as the champion of the Faith, took not\r\nonly the deepest interest, but an active part. To this I shall return\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nBut while at peace with her Christian brethren, Spain was engaged in\r\nperpetual hostilities with the Moslems, both of Africa and Asia. The\r\nrelations of Europe with the East were altogether different in the\r\nsixteenth century from what they are in our day. The Turkish power lay\r\nlike a dark cloud on the Eastern horizon, to which every eye was turned\r\nwith apprehension; and the same people for whose protection European\r\nnations are now willing to make common cause, were viewed by them, in\r\nthe sixteenth century, in the light of a common enemy.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for Islamism that, as the standard of the Prophet was\r\nfalling from the feeble grasp of the Arabs, it was caught up by a nation\r\nlike the Turks, whose fiery zeal urged them to bear it still onward in\r\nthe march of victory. The Turks were to the Arabs what the Romans were\r\nto the Greeks. Bold, warlike, and ambitious, they had little of that\r\nlove of art which had been the dominant passion of their predecessors,\r\nand still less of that refinement which, with the Arabs, had degenerated\r\ninto effeminacy and sloth. Their form of government was admirably suited\r\nto their character. It was an unmixed despotism. The sovereign, if not\r\nprecisely invested with the theocratic character of the caliphs, was\r\nhedged round with so much sanctity, that resistance to his authority was\r\nan offence against religion as well as law. He was placed at an\r\nimmeasurable distance above his subjects. No hereditary aristocracy was\r\nallowed to soften the descent, and interpose a protecting barrier for\r\nthe people. All power was derived from the sovereign, and, on the death\r\nof its proprietor, returned to him. In the eye of the sultan, his\r\nvassals were all equal, and all equally his slaves.\r\n\r\nThe theory of an absolute government would seem to imply perfection in\r\nthe head of it. But, as perfection is not the lot of humanity, it was\r\nprudently provided by the Turkish constitution that the sultan should\r\nhave the benefit of a council to advise him. It consisted of three or\r\nfour great officers, appointed by himself, with the grand-vizier at\r\ntheir head. This functionary was possessed of an authority far exceeding\r\nthat of the prime-minister of any European prince. All the business of\r\nstate may be said to have passed through his hands. The persons chosen\r\nfor this high office were usually men of capacity and experience; and in\r\na weak reign they served by their large authority to screen the\r\nincapacity of the sovereign from the eyes of his subjects, while they\r\npreserved the state from detriment. It might be thought that powers so\r\nvast as those bestowed on the vizier might have rendered him formidable,\r\nif not dangerous, to his master. But his master was placed as far above\r\nhim as above the meanest of his subjects. He had unlimited power of life\r\nand death; and how little he was troubled with scruples in the exercise\r\nof this power is abundantly shown in history. The bowstring was too\r\noften the only warrant for the deposition of a minister.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable of the Turkish institutions, the one which may\r\nbe said to have formed the keystone of the system, was that relating to\r\nthe Christian population of the empire. Once in five years a general\r\nconscription was made, by means of which all the children of Christian\r\nparents who had reached the age of seven, and gave promise of excellence\r\nin mind or body, were taken from their homes and brought to the capital.\r\nThey were then removed to different quarters, and placed in seminaries\r\nwhere they might receive such instruction as would fit them for the\r\nduties of life. Those giving greatest promise of strength and endurance\r\nwere sent to places prepared for them in Asia Minor. Here they were\r\nsubjected to a severe training, to abstinence, to privations of every\r\nkind, and to the strict discipline which should fit them for the\r\nprofession of a soldier. From this body was formed the famous corps of\r\nthe janizaries.\r\n\r\nAnother portion were placed in schools in the capital, or the\r\nneighboring cities, where, under the eye of the sultan, as it were, they\r\nwere taught various manly accomplishments, with such a smattering of\r\nscience as Turkish, or rather Arabian, scholarship could supply. When\r\ntheir education was finished, some went into the sultan's body-guard,\r\nwhere a splendid provision was made for their maintenance. Others,\r\nintended for civil life, entered on a career which might lead to the\r\nhighest offices in the state.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONDITION OF TURKEY.]\r\n\r\nAs all these classes of Christian youths were taken from their parents\r\nat that tender age when the doctrines of their own faith could hardly\r\nhave taken root in their minds, they were, without difficulty, won over\r\nto the faith of the Koran; which was further commended to their choice\r\nas the religion of the state, the only one which opened to them the path\r\nof preferment. Thus set apart from the rest of the community, and\r\ncherished by royal favor, the new converts, as they rallied round the\r\nthrone of their sovereign, became more stanch in their devotion to his\r\ninterests, as well as to the interests of the religion they had adopted,\r\nthan even the Turks themselves.\r\n\r\nThis singular institution bore hard on the Christian population, who\r\npaid this heavy tax of their own offspring. But it worked well for the\r\nmonarchy, which, acquiring fresh vigor from the constant infusion of new\r\nblood into its veins, was slow in exhibiting any signs of decrepitude or\r\ndecay.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these various classes was that of the janizaries,\r\nwhose discipline was far from terminating with the school. Indeed, their\r\nwhole life may be said to have been passed in war, or in preparation for\r\nit. Forbidden to marry, they had no families to engage their affections,\r\nwhich, as with the monks and friars in Christian countries, were\r\nconcentrated on their own order, whose prosperity was inseparably\r\nconnected with that of the state. Proud of the privileges which\r\ndistinguished them from the rest of the army, they seemed desirous to\r\nprove their title to them by their thorough discipline, and by their\r\npromptness to execute the most dangerous and difficult services. Their\r\npost was always the post of danger. It was their proud vaunt, that they\r\nhad never fled before an enemy. Clad in their flowing robes, so little\r\nsuited to the warrior, armed with the arquebuse and the scymitar,--in\r\ntheir hands more than a match for the pike or sword of the\r\nEuropean,--with the heron's plume waving above their heads, their dense\r\narray might ever be seen bearing down in the thickest of the fight; and\r\nmore than once, when the fate of the empire trembled in the balance, it\r\nwas this invincible corps that turned the scale, and by their intrepid\r\nconduct decided the fortune of the day. Gathering fresh reputation with\r\nage, so long as their discipline remained unimpaired, they were a match\r\nfor the best soldiers of Europe. But in time this admirable organization\r\nexperienced a change. One sultan allowed them to marry; another, to\r\nbring their sons into the corps; a third opened the ranks to Turks as\r\nwell as Christians; until, forfeiting their peculiar character, the\r\njanizaries became confounded with the militia of the empire. These\r\nchanges occurred in the time of Philip the Second; but their\r\nconsequences were not fully unfolded till the following century.[1270]\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for the Turks, considering the unlimited power lodged\r\nin the hands of their rulers, that these should have so often been\r\npossessed of the courage and capacity for using it for the advancement\r\nof the nation. From Othman the First, the founder of the dynasty, to\r\nSolyman the Magnificent, the contemporary of Philip, the Turkish throne\r\nwas filled by a succession of able princes, who, bred to war, were every\r\nyear enlarging the boundaries of the empire, and adding to its\r\nresources. By the middle of the sixteenth century, besides their vast\r\npossessions in Asia, they held the eastern portions of Africa. In\r\nEurope, together with the countries at this day acknowledging their\r\nsceptre, they were masters of Greece; and Solyman, overrunning\r\nTransylvania and Hungary, had twice carried his victorious banners up\r\nto the walls of Vienna. The battle-ground of the Cross and the Crescent\r\nwas transferred from the west to the east of Europe; and Germany in the\r\nsixteenth century became what Spain and the Pyrenees had been in the\r\neighth, the bulwark of Christendom.\r\n\r\nNor was the power of Turkey on the sea less formidable than on the land.\r\nHer fleet rode undisputed mistress of the Levant; for Venice, warned by\r\nthe memorable defeat at Prevesa, in 1538, and by the loss of Cyprus and\r\nother territories, hardly ventured to renew the contest. That wily\r\nrepublic found that it was safer to trust to diplomacy than to arms, in\r\nher dealings with the Ottomans.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish navy, sweeping over the Mediterranean, combined with the\r\ncorsairs of the Barbary coast,--who, to some extent, owed allegiance to\r\nthe Porte,--and made frequent descents on the coasts of Italy and Spain,\r\ncommitting worse ravages than those of the hurricane. From these ravages\r\nFrance only was exempt; for her princes, with an unscrupulous policy\r\nwhich caused general scandal in Christendom, by an alliance with the\r\nTurks, protected her territories somewhat at the expense of her honor.\r\n\r\nThe northern coast of Africa, at this time, was occupied by various\r\nraces, who, however they may have differed in other respects, all united\r\nin obedience to the Koran. Among them was a large infusion of Moors\r\ndescended from the Arab tribes who had once occupied the south of Spain,\r\nand who, on its reconquest by the Christians, had fled that country\r\nrather than renounce the religion of their fathers. Many even of the\r\nMoors then living were among the victims of this religious persecution;\r\nand they looked with longing eyes on the beautiful land of their\r\ninheritance, and with feelings of unquenchable hatred on the Spaniards\r\nwho had deprived them of it.\r\n\r\nThe African shore was studded with towns,--some of them, like Algiers,\r\nTunis, Tripoli, having a large extent of territory adjacent,--which\r\nowned the sway of some Moslem chief, who ruled them in sovereign state,\r\nor, it might be, acknowledging, for the sake of protection, a qualified\r\nallegiance to the sultan. These rude chiefs, profiting by their maritime\r\nposition, followed the dreadful trade of the corsair. Issuing from their\r\nstrongholds, they fell on the unprotected merchantmen, or, descending on\r\nthe opposite coasts of Andalusia and Valencia, sacked the villages, and\r\nswept off the wretched inhabitants into slavery.\r\n\r\nThe Castilian government did what it could for the protection of its\r\nsubjects. Fortified posts were established along the shores.\r\nWatch-towers were raised on the heights, to give notice of the approach\r\nof an enemy. A fleet of galleys, kept constantly on duty, rode off the\r\ncoasts to intercept the corsairs. The war was occasionally carried into\r\nthe enemy's country. Expeditions were fitted out, to sweep the Barbary\r\nshores, or to batter down the strongholds of the pirates. Other states,\r\nwhose territories bordered on the Mediterranean, joined in these\r\nexpeditions; among them Tuscany, Rome, Naples, Sicily,--the two last the\r\ndependencies of Spain,--and above all Genoa, whose hardy seamen did good\r\nservice in these maritime wars. To these should be added the Knights of\r\nSt. John, whose little island of Malta, with its iron defences, boldly\r\nbidding defiance to the enemy, was thrown into the very jaws, as it\r\nwere, of the African coast. Pledged by their vows to perpetual war with\r\nthe infidel, these brave knights, thus stationed on the outposts of\r\nChristendom, were the first to sound the alarm of invasion, as they were\r\nthe foremost to repel it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AFRICAN CORSAIRS.]\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean, in that day, presented a very different spectacle\r\nfrom what it shows at present,--swarming, as it does, with the commerce\r\nof many a distant land, and its shores glittering with towns and\r\nvillages, that echo to the sounds of peaceful and protected industry.\r\nLong tracts of deserted territory might then be seen on its borders,\r\nwith the blackened ruins of many a hamlet, proclaiming too plainly the\r\nrecent presence of the corsair. The condition of the peasantry of the\r\nsouth of Spain, in that day, was not unlike that of our New England\r\nancestors, whose rural labors might, at any time, be broken by the\r\nwarwhoop of the savage, as he burst on the peaceful settlement, sweeping\r\noff its wretched inmates--those whom he did not massacre--to captivity\r\nin the wilderness. The trader, instead of pushing out to sea, crept\r\ntimidly along the shore, under the protecting wings of its fortresses,\r\nfearful lest the fierce enemy might dart on him unawares, and bear him\r\noff to the dungeons of Africa. Or, if he ventured out into the open\r\ndeep, it was under a convoy of well-armed galleys, or, armed to the\r\nteeth himself, prepared for war.\r\n\r\nScarcely a day passed without some conflict between Christian and Moslem\r\non the Mediterranean waters. Not unfrequently, instead of a Moor, the\r\ncommand was intrusted to some Christian renegade, who, having renounced\r\nhis country and his religion for the roving life of a corsair, felt,\r\nlike most apostates, a keener hatred than even its natural enemies for\r\nthe land he had abjured.[1271] In these encounters, there were often\r\ndisplayed, on both sides, such deeds of heroism as, had they been\r\nperformed on a wider theatre of action, would have covered the actors\r\nwith immortal glory. By this perpetual warfare a race of hardy and\r\nexperienced seamen was formed, in the countries bordering on the\r\nMediterranean; and more than one name rose to eminence for nautical\r\nscience as well as valor, with which it would not be easy to find a\r\nparallel in other quarters of Christendom. Such were the Dorias of\r\nGenoa,--a family to whom the ocean seemed their native element; and\r\nwhose brilliant achievements on its waters, through successive\r\ngenerations, shed an undying lustre on the arms of the republic.\r\n\r\nThe corsair's life was full of maritime adventure. Many a tale of tragic\r\ninterest was told of his exploits, and many a sad recital of the\r\nsufferings of the Christian captive, tugging at the oar, or pining in\r\nthe dungeons of Tripoli and Algiers. Such tales formed the burden of the\r\npopular minstrelsy of the period, as well as of more elegant\r\nliterature,--the drama, and romantic fiction. But fact was stranger than\r\nfiction. It would have been difficult to exaggerate the number of the\r\nChristian captives, or the amount of their sufferings. On the conquest\r\nof Tunis by Charles the Fifth, in 1535, ten thousand of these unhappy\r\npersons, as we are assured, walked forth from its dungeons, and knelt,\r\nwith tears of gratitude and joy, at the feet of their liberator.\r\nCharitable associations were formed in Spain, for the sole purpose of\r\nraising funds to ransom the Barbary prisoners. But the ransom demanded\r\nwas frequently exorbitant, and the efforts of these benevolent\r\nfraternities made but a feeble impression on the whole number of\r\ncaptives.\r\n\r\nThus the war between the Cross and the Crescent was still carried on\r\nalong the shores of the Mediterranean, when the day of the Crusades was\r\npast in most of the other quarters of Christendom. The existence of the\r\nSpaniard--as I have often had occasion to remark--was one long crusade;\r\nand in the sixteenth century he was still doing battle with the infidel,\r\nas stoutly as in the heroic days of the Cid. The furious contests with\r\nthe petty pirates of Barbary engendered in his bosom feelings of even\r\nkeener hostility than that which grew up in his contests with the Arabs,\r\nwhere there was no skulking, predatory foe, but army was openly arrayed\r\nagainst army, and they fought for the sovereignty of the Peninsula. The\r\nfeeling of religious hatred rekindled by the Moors of Africa extended\r\nin some degree to the Morisco population, who still occupied those\r\nterritories on the southern borders of the monarchy which had belonged\r\nto their ancestors, the Spanish Arabs. This feeling was increased by the\r\nsuspicion, not altogether without foundation, of a secret correspondence\r\nbetween the Moriscos and their brethren on the Barbary coast. These\r\nmingled sentiments of hatred and suspicion sharpened the sword of\r\npersecution, and led to most disastrous consequences, which before long\r\nwill be unfolded to the reader.\r\n\r\nAmong the African corsairs was one by the name of Dragut, distinguished\r\nfor his daring spirit, and the pestilent activity with which he pursued\r\nthe commerce of the Spaniards. In early life he had been made prisoner\r\nby Andrew Doria; and the four years during which he was chained to the\r\noar in the galleys of Genoa did not serve to mitigate the feelings of\r\nhatred which he had always borne to the Christians. On the recovery of\r\nhis freedom, he resumed his desperate trade of a corsair with renewed\r\nactivity. Having made himself master of Tripoli, he issued out, with his\r\ngalleys, from that stronghold, fell on the defenceless merchantman,\r\nravaged the coasts, engaged boldly in fight with the Christian\r\nsquadrons, and made his name as terrible, throughout the Mediterranean,\r\nas that of Barbarossa had been in the time of Charles the Fifth.\r\n\r\nThe people of the southern provinces, smarting under their sufferings,\r\nhad more than once besought Philip to send an expedition against\r\nTripoli, and, if possible, break up this den of thieves, and rid the\r\nMediterranean of the formidable corsair. But Philip, who was in the\r\nmidst of his victorious campaigns against the French, had neither the\r\nleisure nor the resources, at that time, for such an enterprise. In the\r\nspring of 1559, however, he gave orders to the duke of Medina Celi,\r\nviceroy of Sicily, to fit out an armament for the purpose, to obtain the\r\ncoöperation of the Italian states, and to take command of the\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nA worse choice for the command could not have been made; and this not so\r\nmuch from the duke's inexperience; for an apprenticeship to the sea was\r\nnot deemed necessary to form a naval commander, in an age when men\r\npassed indifferently from the land-service to the sea-service. But, with\r\nthe exception of personal courage, the duke of Medina Celi seems to have\r\npossessed none of the qualities requisite in a commander, whether by\r\nland or sea.\r\n\r\nThe different Italian powers--Tuscany, Rome, Naples, Sicily, Genoa--all\r\nfurnished their respective quotas. John Andrew Doria, nephew of the\r\ngreat Andrew, and worthy of the name he bore, had command of the galleys\r\nof the republic. To these was added the reinforcement of the\r\ngrand-master of Malta. The whole fleet amounted to more than a hundred\r\nsail, fifty-four of which were galleys; by much the larger part being\r\nfurnished by Spain and her Italian provinces. Fourteen thousand troops\r\nembarked on board the squadron. So much time was consumed in\r\npreparation, that the armament was not got ready for sea till late in\r\nOctober, 1559,--too late for acting with advantage on the stormy African\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EXPEDITION AGAINST TRIPOLI.]\r\n\r\nThis did not deter the viceroy, who, at the head of the combined fleet,\r\nsailed out of the port of Syracuse in November. But the elements\r\nconspired against this ill-starred expedition. Scarcely had the squadron\r\nleft the port, when it was assailed by a tempest, which scattered the\r\nvessels, disabled some, and did serious damage to others. To add to the\r\ncalamity, an epidemic broke out among the men, caused by the bad quality\r\nof the provisions furnished by the Genoese contractors. In his distress,\r\nthe duke of Medina Celi put in at the island of Malta. He met with a\r\nhospitable reception from the grand-master; for hospitality was one of\r\nthe obligations of the order. Fall two mouths elapsed before the duke\r\nwas in a condition to reëmbark, with his force reduced nearly one third\r\nby disease and death.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Dragut, having ascertained the object of the expedition, had\r\nmade every effort to put Tripoli in a posture of defence. At the same\r\ntime he sent to Constantinople, to solicit the aid of Solyman. The\r\nSpanish admiral, in the crippled condition of his armament, determined\r\nto postpone the attack on Tripoli to another time, and to direct his\r\noperations for the present against the island of Jerbah, or, as it was\r\ncalled by the Spaniards, Gelves. This place, situated scarcely a league\r\nfrom the African shore, in the neighborhood of Tripoli, had long been\r\nknown as a nest of pirates, who did great mischief in the Mediterranean.\r\nIt was a place of ill-omen to the Spaniards, whose arms had met there\r\nwith a memorable reverse in the reign of Ferdinand the Catholic.[1272]\r\nThe duke, however, landing with his whole force, experienced little\r\nresistance from the Moors, and soon made himself master of the place. It\r\nwas defended by a fortress fallen much out of repair; and, as the\r\nSpanish commander proposed to leave a garrison there, he set about\r\nrestoring the fortifications, or rather constructing new ones. In this\r\nwork the whole army actively engaged; but nearly two months were\r\nconsumed before it was finished. The fortress was then mounted with\r\nartillery, and provided with ammunition, and whatever was necessary for\r\nits defence. Finally, a garrison was introduced into it, and the command\r\nintrusted to a gallant officer, Don Alonzo de Sandé.\r\n\r\nScarcely had these arrangements been completed, and the troops prepared\r\nto reëmbark, when advices reached the duke that a large Turkish fleet\r\nwas on its way from Constantinople to the assistance of Dragut. The\r\nSpanish admiral called a council of war on board of his ship. Opinions\r\nwere divided. Some, among whom was Doria, considering the crippled\r\ncondition of their squadron, were for making the best of their way back\r\nto Sicily. Others, regarding this as a course unworthy of Spaniards,\r\nwere for standing out to sea, and giving battle to the enemy. The duke,\r\nperplexed by the opposite opinions, did not come to a decision. He was\r\nsoon spared the necessity of it by the sight of the Ottoman fleet, under\r\nfull sail, bearing rapidly down on him. It consisted of eighty-six\r\ngalleys, each carrying a hundred janizaries; and it was commanded by the\r\nTurkish admiral, Piali, a name long dreaded in the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of this formidable armament, the Christians were seized\r\nwith a panic. They scarcely offered any resistance to the enemy; who,\r\ndashing into the midst of them, sent his broadsides to the right and\r\nleft, sinking some of the ships, disabling others, while those out of\r\nreach of his guns shamefully sought safety in flight. Seventeen of the\r\ncombined squadron were sunk; four-and-twenty, more or less injured,\r\nstruck their colors; a few succeeded in regaining the island, and took\r\nshelter under the guns of the fortress. Medina Celi and Doria were among\r\nthose who thus made their way to the shore; and under cover of the\r\ndarkness, on the following night, they effected their escape in a\r\nfrigate, passing, as by a miracle, without notice, through the enemy's\r\nfleet, and thus securing their retreat to Sicily. Never was there a\r\nvictory more humiliating to the vanquished, or one which reflected less\r\nglory on the victors.[1273]\r\n\r\nBefore embarking, the duke ordered Sandé to defend the place to the last\r\nextremity, promising him speedy assistance. The garrison, thus left to\r\ncarry on the contest with the whole Turkish army, amounted to about\r\nfive thousand men; its original strength being considerably augmented by\r\nthe fugitives from the fleet.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, Piali landed with his whole force, and\r\ninstantly proceeded to open trenches before the citadel. When he had\r\nestablished his batteries of cannon, he sent a summons to the garrison\r\nto surrender. Sandé returned for answer, that, \"if the place were won,\r\nit would not be, like Piali's late victory, without bloodshed.\" The\r\nTurkish commander waited no longer, but opened a lively cannonade on the\r\nramparts, which he continued for some days, till a practicable breach\r\nwas made. He then ordered a general assault. The janizaries rushed\r\nforward with their usual impetuosity, under a murderous discharge of\r\nartillery and small arms from the fortress as well as from the shipping,\r\nwhich was so situated as to support the fire of the besieged. Nothing\r\ndaunted, the brave Moslems pushed forward over the bodies of their\r\nfallen comrades; and, scrambling across the ditch, the leading files\r\nsucceeded in throwing themselves into the breach. But here they met with\r\na spirit as determined as their own, from the iron array of warriors,\r\narmed with pike and arquebuse, who, with Sandé at their head, formed a\r\nwall as impenetrable as the ramparts of the fortress. The contest was\r\nnow carried on man against man, and in a space too narrow to allow the\r\nenemy to profit by his superior numbers. The besieged, meanwhile, from\r\nthe battlements, hurled down missiles of every description on the heads\r\nof the assailants. The struggle lasted for some hours. But Spanish valor\r\ntriumphed in the end, and the enemy was driven back in disorder across\r\nthe moat, while his rear files were sorely galled, in his retreat, by\r\nthe incessant fire of the fortress.\r\n\r\nIncensed by the failure of his attack and the slaughter of his brave\r\nfollowers, Piali thought it prudent to wait till he should be reinforced\r\nby the arrival of Dragut with a fresh supply of men and of battering\r\nordnance. The besieged profited by the interval to repair their works,\r\nand when Dragut appeared they were nearly as well prepared for the\r\ncontest as before.\r\n\r\nOn the corsair's arrival, Piali, provided with a heavier battering\r\ntrain, opened a more effective fire on the citadel. The works soon gave\r\nway, and the Turkish commander promptly returned to the assault. It was\r\nconducted with the same spirit, was met with the same desperate courage,\r\nand ended, like the former, in the total discomfiture of the assailants,\r\nwho withdrew, leaving the fosse choked up with the bodies of their\r\nslaughtered comrades. Again and again the attack was renewed, by an\r\nenemy whose numbers allowed the storming parties to relieve one another,\r\nwhile the breaches made by an unintermitting cannonade gave incessant\r\noccupation to the besieged in repairing them. Fortunately, the number of\r\nthe latter enabled them to perform this difficult service; and though\r\nmany were disabled, and there were few who were not wounded, they still\r\ncontinued to stand to their posts, with the same spirit as on the first\r\nday of the siege.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DESPERATE DEFENCE OF GELVES.]\r\n\r\nBut the amount of the garrison, so serviceable in this point of view,\r\nwas fatal in another. The fortress had been provisioned with reference\r\nto a much smaller force. The increased number of mouths was thus doing\r\nthe work of the enemy. Notwithstanding the strictest economy, there was\r\nalready a scarcity of provisions; and, at the end of six weeks, the\r\ngarrison was left entirely without food. The water too had failed. A\r\nsoldier had communicated to the Spanish commander an ingenious process\r\nfor distilling fresh water from salt.[1274] This afforded a most\r\nimportant supply, though in a very limited quantity. But the wood which\r\nfurnished the fuel necessary for the process was at length exhausted,\r\nand to hunger was added the intolerable misery of thirst.\r\n\r\nThus reduced to extremity, the brave Sandé was not reduced to despair.\r\nCalling his men together, he told them that liberty was of more value\r\nthan life. Anything was better than to surrender to such an enemy. And\r\nhe proposed to them to sally from the fortress that very night, and cut\r\ntheir way, if possible, through the Turkish army, or fall in the\r\nattempt. The Spaniards heartily responded to the call of their heroic\r\nleader. They felt, like him, that the doom of slavery was more terrible\r\nthan death.\r\n\r\nThat night, or rather two hours before dawn on the twenty-ninth of June,\r\nDon Alvaro sallied out of the fortress, at the head of all those who\r\nwere capable of bearing arms. But they amounted to scarcely more than a\r\nthousand men, so greatly had the garrison been diminished by death, or\r\ndisabled by famine and disease. Under cover of the darkness, they\r\nsucceeded in passing through the triple row of intrenchments, without\r\nalarming the slumbering enemy. At length, roused by the cries of their\r\nsentinels, the Turks sprang to their arms, and, gathering in dark masses\r\nround the Christians, presented an impenetrable barrier to their\r\nadvance. The contest now became furious; but it was short. The heroic\r\nlittle band were too much enfeebled by their long fatigues, and by the\r\ntotal want of food for the last two days, to make head against the\r\noverwhelming number of their assailants. Many fell under the Turkish\r\nscymitars, and the rest, after a fierce struggle, were forced back on\r\nthe path by which they had come, and took refuge in the fort. Their\r\ndauntless leader, refusing to yield, succeeded in cutting his way\r\nthrough the enemy, and threw himself into one of the vessels in the\r\nport. Here he was speedily followed by such a throng as threatened to\r\nsink the bark, and made resistance hopeless. Yielding up his sword,\r\ntherefore, he was taken prisoner, and led off in triumph to the tent of\r\nthe Turkish commander.\r\n\r\nOn the same day the remainder of the garrison, unable to endure another\r\nassault, surrendered at discretion. Piali had now accomplished the\r\nobject of the expedition; and, having reëstablished the Moorish\r\nauthorities in possession of the place, he embarked, with his whole\r\narmy, for Constantinople. The tidings of his victory had preceded him;\r\nand, as he proudly sailed up the Bosphorus, he was greeted with thunders\r\nof artillery from the seraglio and the heights surrounding the capital.\r\nFirst came the Turkish galleys, in beautiful order, with the banners\r\ntaken from the Christians ignominiously trailing behind them through the\r\nwater. Then followed their prizes,--the seventeen vessels taken in the\r\naction,--the battered condition of which formed a striking contrast to\r\nthat of their conquerors. But the prize greater than all was the\r\nprisoners, amounting to nearly four thousand, who, manacled like so many\r\nmalefactors, were speedily landed, and driven through the streets,\r\namidst the shouts and hootings of the populace, to the slave-market of\r\nConstantinople. A few only, of the higher order, were reserved for\r\nransom. Among them were Don Alvaro de Sandé and a son of Medina Celi.\r\nThe young nobleman did not long survive his captivity. Don Alvaro\r\nrecovered his freedom, and lived to take ample vengeance for all he had\r\nsuffered on his conquerors.[1275]\r\n\r\nSuch was the end of the disastrous expedition against Tripoli, which\r\nleft a stain on the Spanish arms that even the brave conduct of the\r\ngarrison at Gelves could not wholly wipe away. The Moors were greatly\r\nelated by the discomfiture of their enemies; and the Spaniards were\r\nfilled with a proportionate degree of despondency, as they reflected to\r\nwhat extent their coasts and their commerce would be exposed to the\r\npredatory incursions of the corsairs. Philip was especially anxious in\r\nregard to the safety of his possessions on the African coast. The two\r\nprincipal of these were Oran and Mazarquivir, situated not far to the\r\nwest of Algiers. They were the conquests of Cardinal Ximenes. The former\r\nplace was won by an expedition fitted out at his own expense. The\r\nenterprises of this remarkable man were conducted on a gigantic scale,\r\nwhich might seem better suited to the revenues of princes. Of the two\r\nplaces Oran was the more considerable; yet hardly more important than\r\nMazarquivir, which possessed an excellent harbor,--a thing of rare\r\noccurrence on the Barbary shore. Both had been cherished with care by\r\nthe Castilian government, and by no monarch more than by Philip the\r\nSecond, who perfectly understood the importance of these possessions,\r\nboth for the advantages of a commodious harbor, and for the means they\r\ngave him of bridling the audacity of the African cruisers.[1276]\r\n\r\nIn 1562, the king ordered a squadron of four and twenty galleys, under\r\nthe command of Don Juan de Mendoza, to be got ready in the port of\r\nMalaga, to carry supplies to the African colonies. But in crossing the\r\nMediterranean, the ships were assailed by a furious tempest, which\r\ncompelled them to take refuge in the little port of Herradura. The fury\r\nof the storm, however, continued to increase; and the vessels, while\r\nriding at anchor, dashed against one another with such violence, that\r\nmany of them foundered, and others, parting their cables, drifted on\r\nshore, which was covered far and wide with the dismal wrecks. Two or\r\nthree only, standing out to sea, and braving the hurricane on the deep,\r\nwere so fortunate as to escape. By this frightful shipwreck, four\r\nthousand men, including their commander, were swallowed up by the waves.\r\nThe southern provinces were filled with consternation at this new\r\ncalamity, coming so soon after the defeat at Gelves. It seemed as if the\r\nhand of Providence was lifted against them in their wars with the\r\nMussulmans.[1277]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WAR ON THE BARBARY COAST.]\r\n\r\nThe Barbary Moors, encouraged by the losses of the Spanish navy, thought\r\nthis a favorable time for recovering their ancient possessions on the\r\ncoast. Hassem, the dey of Algiers, in particular, a warlike prince, who\r\nhad been engaged in more than one successful encounter with the\r\nChristians, set on foot an expedition against the territories of Oran\r\nand Mazarquivir. The government of these places was intrusted, at that\r\ntime, to Don Alonzo de Cordova, count of Alcaudete. In this post he had\r\nsucceeded his father, a gallant soldier, who, five years before, had\r\nbeen slain in battle by this very Hassem, the lord of Algiers. Eight\r\nthousand Spaniards had fallen with him on the field, or had been made\r\nprisoners of war.[1278] Such were the sad auspices under which the\r\nreign of Philip the Second began, in his wars with the Moslems.[1279]\r\n\r\nOran, at this time, was garrisoned by seventeen hundred men; and\r\ntwenty-seven pieces of artillery were mounted on its walls. Its\r\nfortifications were in good repair; but it was in no condition to stand\r\na siege by so formidable a force as that which Hassem was mustering in\r\nAlgiers. The count of Alcaudete, the governor, a soldier worthy of the\r\nillustrious stock from which he sprang, lost no time in placing both\r\nOran and Mazarquivir in the best state of defence which his means\r\nallowed, and in acquainting Philip with the peril in which he stood.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Algerine chief was going briskly forward with his\r\npreparations. Besides his own vassals, he summoned to his aid the petty\r\nprinces of the neighboring country; and in a short time he had assembled\r\na host in which Moors, Arabs, and Turks were promiscuously mingled, and\r\nwhich, in the various estimates of the Spaniards, rose from fifty to a\r\nhundred thousand men.\r\n\r\nLittle reliance can be placed on the numerical estimates of the\r\nSpaniards in their wars with the infidel. The gross exaggeration of the\r\nnumbers brought by the enemy into the field, and the numbers he was sure\r\nto leave there, with the corresponding diminution of their own in both\r\nparticulars, would seem to infer that, in these religious wars, they\r\nthought some miracle was necessary to show that Heaven was on their\r\nside, and the greater the miracle the greater the glory. This\r\nhyperbolical tone, characteristic of the old Spaniards, and said to have\r\nbeen imported from the East, is particularly visible in the accounts of\r\ntheir struggles with the Spanish Arabs, where large masses were brought\r\ninto the field on both sides, and where the reports of a battle took\r\nindeed the coloring of an Arabian tale. The same taint of exaggeration,\r\nthough somewhat mitigated, continued to a much later period, and may be\r\nobserved in the reports of the contests with the Moslems, whether Turks\r\nor Moors, in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth of March, 1563, Hassem left Algiers, at the head of his\r\nsomewhat miscellaneous array, sending his battering train of artillery\r\nround by water, to meet him at the port of Mazarquivir. He proposed to\r\nbegin by the siege of this place, which, while it would afford a\r\nconvenient harbor for his navy, would, by its commanding position,\r\nfacilitate the conquest of Oran. Leaving a strong body of men,\r\ntherefore, for the investment of the latter, he continued his march on\r\nMazarquivir, situated at only two leagues' distance. The defence of this\r\nplace was intrusted by Alcaudete to his brother, Don Martin de Cordova.\r\nIts fortifications were in good condition, and garnished with near\r\nthirty pieces of artillery. It was garrisoned by five hundred men, was\r\nwell provided with ammunition, and was victualled for a two months'\r\nsiege. It was also protected by a detached fort, called St. Michael,\r\nbuilt by the count of Alcaudete, and, from its commanding position, now\r\ndestined to be the first object of attack. The fort was occupied by a\r\nfew hundred Spaniards, who, as it was of great moment to gain time for\r\nthe arrival of succors from Spain, were ordered to maintain it to the\r\nlast extremity.\r\n\r\nHassem was not long in opening trenches. Impatient, however, of the\r\ndelay of his fleet, which was detained by the weather, he determined not\r\nto wait for the artillery, but to attempt to carry the fort by escalade.\r\nIn this attempt, though conducted with spirit, he met with so decided a\r\nrepulse, that he abandoned the project of further operations till the\r\narrival of his ships. No sooner did this take place, than, landing his\r\nheavy guns, he got them into position as speedily as possible, and\r\nopened a lively cannonade on the walls of the fortress. The walls were\r\nof no great strength. A breach was speedily made; and Hassem gave orders\r\nfor the assault.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the signal given, than Moor, Turk, Arab,--the various\r\nraces in whose veins glowed the hot blood of the south,--sprang\r\nimpetuously forward. In vain the leading files, as they came on, were\r\nswept away by the artillery of the fortress, while the guns of\r\nMazarquivir did equal execution on their flank. The tide rushed on, with\r\nan enthusiasm that overleaped every obstacle. Each man seemed emulous of\r\nhis comrade, as if desirous to show the superiority of his own tribe or\r\nrace. The ditch, choked up with the _débris_ of the rampart and the\r\nfascines that had been thrown into it, was speedily crossed; and while\r\nsome sprang fearlessly into the breach, others endeavored to scale the\r\nwalls. But everywhere they were met by men as fresh for action as\r\nthemselves, and possessed of a spirit as intrepid. The battle raged\r\nalong the parapet, and in the breach, where the struggle was deadliest.\r\nIt was the old battle, so often fought, of the Crescent and the Cross,\r\nthe fiery African and the cool, indomitable European. Arquebuse and\r\npike, sabre and scymitar, clashed fearfully against each other; while\r\nhigh above the din rose the war-cries of \"Allah!\" and \"St. Jago!\"\r\nshowing the creeds and countries of the combatants.\r\n\r\nAt one time it seemed as if the enthusiasm of the Moslems would prevail;\r\nand twice the standard of the Crescent was planted on the walls. But it\r\nwas speedily torn down by the garrison, and the bold adventurers who had\r\nplanted it thrown headlong into the moat.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile an incessant fire of musketry was kept up from the ramparts;\r\nand hand-grenades, mingled with barrels of burning pitch, were hurled\r\ndown on the heads of the assailants, whose confusion was increased, as\r\ntheir sight was blinded by the clouds of smoke which rose from the\r\nfascines that had taken fire in the ditch. But although their efforts\r\nbegan to slacken, they were soon encouraged by fresh detachments sent to\r\ntheir support by Hassem, and the fight was renewed with redoubled fury.\r\nThese efforts, however, proved equally ineffectual. The Moors were\r\ndriven back on all points; and, giving way before the invincible courage\r\nof the Spaniards, they withdrew in such disorder across the fosse, now\r\nbridged over with the bodies of the slain, that, if the garrison had\r\nbeen strong enough in numbers, they might have followed the foe to his\r\ntrenches, and inflicted such a blow as would at once have terminated the\r\nsiege. As it was, the loss of the enemy was fearful; while that of the\r\nSpaniards, screened by their defences, was comparatively light. Yet a\r\nhundred lives of the former, so overwhelming were their numbers, were of\r\nless account than a single life among the latter. The heads of fifty\r\nTurks, who had fallen in the breach or in the ditch, were cut off, as we\r\nare told, by the garrison, and sent, as the grisly trophies of their\r\nvictory, to Oran;[1280] showing the feelings of bitter hatred--perhaps\r\nof fear--with which this people was regarded by the Christians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WAR ON THE BARBARY COAST.]\r\n\r\nThe Moorish chief, chafing under this loss, reopened his fire on the\r\nfortress with greater fury than ever. He then renewed the assault, but\r\nwith no better success. A third and a fourth time he returned to the\r\nattack, but in vain. In vain too Hassem madly tore off his turban, and,\r\nbrandishing his scymitar, with imprecations on his men, drove them\r\nforward to the fight. There was no lack of spirit in his followers, who\r\npoured out their blood like water. But it could not shake the constancy\r\nof the Spaniards, which seemed even to grow stronger as their situation\r\nbecame more desperate; and as their defences were swept away, they threw\r\nthemselves on their knees, and from behind the ruins still poured down\r\ntheir volleys of musketry on the assailants.\r\n\r\nYet they could not have maintained their ground so long, but for a\r\nseasonable reinforcement received from Mazarquivir. But, however high\r\nthe spirit, there is a limit to the powers of endurance; and the\r\nstrength of the garrison was rapidly giving way under incessant vigils\r\nand want of food. Their fortifications, moreover, pierced through and\r\nthrough by the enemy's shot, were no longer tenable; and a mine, which\r\nHassem was now prepared to run under the ramparts, would complete the\r\nwork of destruction. They had obeyed their orders, and stood to their\r\ndefence gallantly to the last; and they now obtained leave to abandon\r\nthe fort. On the seventh of May, after having sustained eight assaults\r\nand a siege of three weeks, from a host so superior to them in numbers,\r\nthe garrison marched out of the fortress of St. Michael. Under cover of\r\nthe guns of Mazarquivir, they succeeded in rejoining their comrades\r\nthere with but little loss, and were gladly welcomed by their commander,\r\nDon Martin de Cordova, who rendered them the honor due to their heroic\r\nconduct. That same day Hassem took possession of the fortress. He found\r\nonly a heap of ruins.[1281]\r\n\r\nThe Moorish prince, stung with mortification at the price he had paid\r\nfor his victory, and anxious, moreover, to anticipate the arrival of\r\nsuccors from Spain, now eagerly pressed forward the siege of\r\nMazarquivir. With the assistance of his squadron, the place was closely\r\ninvested by sea and land. Batteries of heavy guns were raised on\r\nopposite sides of the castle; and for ten days they thundered, without\r\ninterruption, on its devoted walls. When these had been so far shaken as\r\nto afford an opening to the besiegers, Hassem, willing to spare the\r\nfurther sacrifice of his men, sent a summons to Don Martin to surrender,\r\nintimating, at the same time, that the works were in too ruinous a\r\ncondition to be defended. To this the Spaniard coolly replied, that, \"if\r\nthey were in such a condition, Hassem might come and take them.\"\r\n\r\nOn the signal from their chief, the Moors moved rapidly forward to the\r\nattack, and were soon brought face to face with their enemy. A bloody\r\nconflict followed, in the breach and on the ramparts. It continued more\r\nthan five hours. The assailants found they had men of the same mettle to\r\ndeal with as before, and with defences yet stronger than those they had\r\nencountered in the fortress of St. Michael. Here again the ardor of the\r\nAfrican proved no match for the cool and steady courage of the European;\r\nand Hassem's forces, repulsed on every quarter, withdrew in so mangled a\r\ncondition to their trenches, that he was in no state for several days to\r\nrenew the assault.[1282]\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to rehearse the operations of a siege so closely\r\nresembling in its details that of the fortress of St. Michael. The most\r\nconspicuous figure in the bloody drama was the commander of the\r\ngarrison, Don Martin de Cordova. Freely exposing himself to hardship and\r\ndanger with the meanest of his followers, he succeeded in infusing his\r\nown unconquerable spirit into their bosoms. On the eve of an assault he\r\nmight be seen passing through the ranks with a crucifix in his hand,\r\nexhorting his men, by the blessed sign of their redemption, to do their\r\nduty, and assuring them of the protection of Heaven.[1283] Every\r\nsoldier, kindling with the enthusiasm of his leader, looked on himself\r\nas a soldier of the Cross, and felt assured that the shield of the\r\nAlmighty must be stretched over those who were thus fighting the battles\r\nof the Faith. The women caught somewhat of the same generous ardor, and,\r\ninstead of confining themselves to the feminine occupations of nursing\r\nthe sick and the wounded, took an active part in the duties of the\r\nsoldiers, and helped to lighten their labors.\r\n\r\nStill the condition of the garrison became daily more precarious, as\r\ntheir strength diminished, and their defences crumbled around them under\r\nthe incessant fire of the besiegers. The count of Alcaudete in vain\r\nendeavored to come to their relief, or at least to effect a diversion in\r\ntheir favor. Sallying out of Oran, he had more than one sharp encounter\r\nwith the enemy. But the odds against him were too great; and though he\r\nspread carnage among the Moslem ranks, he could ill afford the sacrifice\r\nof life that it cost him. In the mean time, the two garrisons were\r\nassailed by an enemy from within, more inexorable than the enemy at\r\ntheir gates. Famine had begun to show itself in some of its hideous\r\nforms. They were already reduced to the necessity of devouring the flesh\r\nof their horses and asses;[1284] and even that was doled out so\r\nscantily, as too plainly intimated that this sustenance, wretched as it\r\nwas, was soon to fail them. Under these circumstances, their spirits\r\nwould have sunk, had they not been sustained by the expectation of\r\nsuccor from Spain; and they cast many a wistful glance on the\r\nMediterranean, straining their eyes to the farthest verge of the\r\nhorizon, to see if they could not descry some friendly sail upon the\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nBut Philip was not unmindful of them. Independently of the importance of\r\nthe posts, he felt his honor to be deeply concerned in the protection of\r\nthe brave men, who were battling there, for the cause not merely of\r\nCastile, but of Christendom. No sooner had he been advised by Alcaudete\r\nof the peril in which he stood, than he gave orders that a fleet should\r\nbe equipped to go to his relief. But such orders, in the disabled\r\ncondition of the navy, were more easily given than executed. Still,\r\nefforts were made to assemble an armament, and get it ready in the\r\nshortest possible time. Even the vessels employed to convoy the India\r\ngalleons were pressed into the service. The young cavaliers of the\r\nsouthern provinces eagerly embarked as volunteers in an expedition which\r\nafforded them an opportunity for avenging the insults offered to the\r\nSpanish arms. The other states bordering on the Mediterranean, which\r\nhad, in fact, almost as deep an interest in the cause as Spain herself,\r\npromptly furnished their contingents. To these were to be added, as\r\nusual, the galleys of the Knights of Malta, always foremost to unfurl\r\nthe banner in a war with the infidel. In less than two months an\r\narmament consisting of forty-two large galleys, besides smaller vessels,\r\nwell manned and abundantly supplied with provisions and military stores,\r\nwas assembled in the port of Malaga. It was placed under the command of\r\nDon Antonio de Mendoza; who, on the sixth of June, weighed anchor, and\r\nsteered directly for the Barbary coast.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WAR ON THE BARBARY COAST.]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the eighth, at early dawn, the sentinels on the\r\nramparts of Mazarquivir descried the fleet like a dark speck on the\r\ndistant waters. As it drew nearer, and the rising sun, glancing on the\r\nflag of Castile, showed that the long-promised succor was at hand, the\r\nexhausted garrison, almost on the brink of despair, gave themselves up\r\nto a delirium of joy. They embraced one another, like men rescued from a\r\nterrible fate, and, with swelling hearts, offered up thanksgivings to\r\nthe Almighty for their deliverance. Soon the cannon of Mazarquivir\r\nproclaimed the glad tidings to the garrison of Oran, who replied, from\r\ntheir battlements, in thunders which carried dismay into the hearts of\r\nthe besiegers. If Hassem had any doubt of the cause of these rejoicings,\r\nit was soon dispelled by several Moorish vessels, which, scudding before\r\nthe enemy, like the smaller birds before the eagle, brought report that\r\na Spanish fleet under full sail was standing for Mazarquivir.\r\n\r\nNo time was to be lost. He commanded his ships lying in the harbor to\r\nslip their cables and make the best of their way to Algiers. Orders were\r\ngiven at once to raise the siege. Everything was abandoned. Whatever\r\ncould be of service to the enemy was destroyed. Hassem caused his guns\r\nto be overcharged, and blew them to pieces.[1285] He disencumbered\r\nhimself of whatever might retard his movements, and, without further\r\ndelay, began his retreat.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did Alcaudete descry the army of the besiegers on its march\r\nacross the hills, than he sallied out, at the head of his cavalry, to\r\nannoy them on their retreat. He was soon joined by his brother from\r\nMazarquivir, with such of the garrison as were in condition for service.\r\nBut the enemy had greatly the start of them. When the Spaniards came up\r\nwith his rear-guard, they found it entirely composed of janizaries; and\r\nthis valiant corps, maintaining its usual discipline, faced about and\r\nopposed so determined a front to the assailants, that Alcaudete, not\r\ncaring to risk the advantages he had already gained, drew off his men,\r\nand left a free passage to the enemy. The soldiers of the two garrisons\r\nnow mingled together, and congratulated one another on their happy\r\ndeliverance, recounting their exploits, and the perils and privations\r\nthey had endured; while Alcaudete, embracing his heroic brother, could\r\nhardly restrain his tears, as he gazed on his wan, emaciated\r\ncountenance, and read there the story of his sufferings.\r\n\r\nThe tidings of the repulse of the Moslems were received with unbounded\r\njoy throughout Spain. The deepest sympathy had been felt for the brave\r\nmen who, planted on the outposts of the empire, seemed to have been\r\nabandoned to their fate. The king shared in the public sentiment, and\r\nshowed his sense of the gallant conduct of Alcaudete and his soldiers,\r\nby the honors and emoluments he bestowed on them. That nobleman, besides\r\nthe grant of a large annual revenue, was made viceroy of Navarre. His\r\nbrother, Don Martin de Cordova, received the _encomienda_ of Hornachos,\r\nwith the sum of six thousand ducats. Officers of inferior rank obtained\r\nthe recompense due to their merits. Even the common soldiers were not\r\nforgotten; and the government, with politic liberality, settled pensions\r\non the wives and children of those who had perished in the siege.[1286]\r\n\r\nPhilip now determined to follow up his success; and, instead of\r\nconfining himself to the defensive, he prepared to carry the war into\r\nthe enemy's country. His first care, however, was to restore the\r\nfortifications of Mazarquivir, which soon rose from their ruins in\r\ngreater strength and solidity than before. He then projected an\r\nexpedition against Peñon de Velez de la Gomera, a place situated to the\r\nwest of his own possessions on the Barbary coast. It was a rocky island\r\nfortress, which, from the great strength of its defences, as well as\r\nfrom its natural position, was deemed impregnable. It was held by a\r\nfierce corsair, whose name had long been terrible in these seas. In the\r\nsummer of 1564, the king, with the aid of his allies, got together a\r\npowerful armament, and sent it at once against Peñon de Velez. This\r\nfortress did not make the resistance to have been expected; and, after a\r\nsiege of scarcely a week's duration, the garrison submitted to the\r\nsuperior valor--or numbers--of the Christians.[1287]\r\n\r\nThis conquest was followed up, the ensuing year, by an expedition under\r\nDon Alvaro Bazan, the first marquis of Santa Cruz,--a name memorable in\r\nthe naval annals of Castile. The object of the expedition was to block\r\nup the entrance to the river Tetuan, in the neighborhood of the late\r\nconquest. The banks of this river had long been the refuge of a horde of\r\npestilent marauders, who, swarming out of its mouth, spread over the\r\nMediterranean, and fell heavily on the commerce of the Christians. Don\r\nAlvaro accomplished his object in the face of a desperate enemy, and,\r\nafter some hard fighting, succeeded in sinking nine brigantines laden\r\nwith stones in the mouth of the river, and thus effectually obstructed\r\nits navigation.[1288]\r\n\r\nThese brilliant successes caused universal rejoicing through Spain and\r\nthe neighboring countries. They were especially important for the\r\ninfluence they exerted on the spirits of the Christians, depressed as\r\nthese had been by a long series of maritime reverses. The Spaniards\r\nresumed their ancient confidence, as they saw that victory had once more\r\nreturned to their banner; and their ships, which had glided like\r\nspectres under the shadow of the coast, now, losing their apprehensions\r\nof the corsair, pushed boldly out upon the deep. The Moslems, on the\r\nother hand, as they beheld their navies discomfited, and one strong\r\nplace after another wrested from their grasp, lost heart, and for a\r\ntime, at least, were in no condition for active enterprise.\r\n\r\nBut while the arms of Spain were thus successful in chastising the\r\nBarbary corsairs, rumors reached the country of hostile preparations\r\ngoing forward in the East, of a more formidable character than any on\r\nthe shores of Africa. The object of these preparations was not Spain\r\nitself, but Malta. Yet this little island, the bulwark of Christendom,\r\nwas so intimately connected with the fortunes of Spain, that an account\r\nof its memorable siege can hardly be deemed an episode in the history of\r\nPhilip the Second.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MASTERS OF RHODES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE KNIGHTS HOSPITALLERS OF ST. JOHN.\r\n\r\nMasters of Rhodes.--Driven from Rhodes.--Established at Malta.--Menaced\r\nby Solyman.--La Valette.--His Preparations for Defence.\r\n\r\n1565.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe order of the Knights of Malta traces its origin to a remote\r\nperiod--to the time of the first crusade, in the eleventh century. A\r\nreligious association was then formed in Palestine, under the title of\r\nHospitallers of St. John the Baptist, the object of which, as the name\r\nimports, was to minister to the wants of the sick. There was a good\r\nharvest of these among the poor pilgrims who wandered from all parts of\r\nEurope to the Holy Land. It was not long before the society assumed\r\nother duties, of a military nature, designed for the defence of the\r\npilgrim no less than his relief; and the new society, under the name of\r\nthe Knights Hospitallers of St. John, besides the usual monastic vows,\r\npledged themselves to defend the Holy Sepulchre, and to maintain\r\nperpetual war against the infidel.[1289]\r\n\r\nIn its new form, so consonant with the spirit of the age, the\r\ninstitution found favor with the bold crusaders, and the accession of\r\nmembers from different parts of Christendom greatly enlarged its power\r\nand political consequence. It soon rivalled the fraternity of the\r\nTemplars, and, like that body, became one of the principal pillars of\r\nthe throne of Jerusalem. After the fall of that kingdom, and the\r\nexpulsion of the Christians from Palestine, the Knights of St. John\r\nremained a short while in Cyprus, when they succeeded in conquering\r\nRhodes from the Turks, and thus secured to themselves a permanent\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\nPlaced in the undisputed sovereignty of this little island, the Knights\r\nof Rhodes, as they were now usually called, found themselves on a new\r\nand independent theatre of action, where they could display all the\r\nresources of their institutions, and accomplish their glorious\r\ndestinies. Thrown into the midst of the Mussulmans, on the borders of\r\nthe Ottoman Empire, their sword was never in the scabbard. Their galleys\r\nspread over the Levant, and, whether alone or with the Venetians,--the\r\nrivals of the Turks in those seas,--they faithfully fulfilled their vow\r\nof incessant war with the infidel. Every week saw their victorious\r\ngalleys returning to port with the rich prizes taken from the enemy; and\r\nevery year the fraternity received fresh accessions of princes and\r\nnobles from every part of Christendom, eager to obtain admission into so\r\nillustrious an order. Many of these were possessed of large estates,\r\nwhich, on their admission, were absorbed in those of the community.\r\nTheir manors, scattered over Europe, far exceeded in number those of\r\ntheir rivals, the Templars, in their most palmy state.[1290] And on the\r\nsuppression of that order, such of its vast possessions as were not\r\nseized by the rapacious princes in whose territories they were lodged,\r\nwere suffered to pass into the hands of the Knights of St. John. The\r\ncommanderies of the latter--those conventual establishments which\r\nfaithfully reflected the parent institution in their discipline--were so\r\nprudently administered, that a large surplus from their revenues was\r\nannually remitted to enrich the treasury of the order.\r\n\r\nThe government of this chivalrous fraternity, as provided by the\r\nstatutes which formed its written constitution, was in its nature\r\naristocratical. At the head was the grand-master, elected by the knights\r\nfrom their own body, and, like the doge of Venice, holding his office\r\nfor life, with an authority scarcely larger than that of this dignitary.\r\nThe legislative and judicial functions were vested in councils, in which\r\nthe grand-master enjoyed no higher privilege than that of a double vote.\r\nBut his patronage was extensive, for he had the nomination to the most\r\nimportant offices, both at home and abroad. The variety and\r\nhigh-sounding titles of these offices may provoke a smile in the reader,\r\nwho might fancy himself occupied with the concerns of a great empire,\r\nrather than those of a little brotherhood of monks. The grand-master,\r\nindeed, in his manner of living, affected the state of a sovereign\r\nprince. He sent his ambassadors to the principal European courts; and a\r\nrank was conceded to him next to that of crowned heads,--above that of\r\nany ducal potentate.[1291]\r\n\r\nHe was enabled to maintain this position by the wealth which, from the\r\nsources already enumerated, flowed into the exchequer. Great sums were\r\nspent in placing the island in the best state of defence, in\r\nconstructing public works, palaces for the grand-master, aad ample\r\naccommodations for the various _languages_,--a technical term, denoting\r\nthe classification of the members according to their respective nations;\r\nfinally, in the embellishment of the capital, which vied in the splendor\r\nof its architecture with the finest cities of Christendom.\r\n\r\nYet, with this show of pomp and magnificence, the Knights of Rhodes did\r\nnot sink into the enervating luxury which was charged on the Templars,\r\nnor did they engage in those worldly, ambitious schemes which provoked\r\nthe jealousy of princes, and brought ruin on that proud order. In\r\nprosperity as in poverty, they were still true to the principles of\r\ntheir institution. Their galleys still spread over the Levant, and came\r\nback victorious from their _caravans_, as their cruises against the\r\nMoslems were termed. In every enterprise set on foot by the Christian\r\npowers against the enemies of the Faith, the red banner of St. John,\r\nwith his eight-pointed cross of white, was still to be seen glittering\r\nin the front of battle. There is no example of a military institution\r\nhaving religion for its object which, under every change of condition,\r\nand for so many centuries, maintained so inflexibly the purity of its\r\nprinciples, and so conscientiously devoted itself to the great object\r\nfor which it was created.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MASTERS OF RHODES.]\r\n\r\nIt was not to be expected that a mighty power, like that of the Turks,\r\nwould patiently endure the existence of a petty enemy on its borders,\r\nwhich, if not formidable from extent of population and empire, like\r\nVenice, was even more annoying by its incessant hostilities, and its\r\ndepredations on the Turkish commerce. More than one sultan, accordingly,\r\nhoping to rid themselves of the annoyance, fitted out expeditions\r\nagainst the island, with the design of crushing the hornets in their\r\nnest. But in every attempt they were foiled by the valor of this little\r\nband of Christian chivalry. At length, in 1522, Solyman the Second led\r\nan expedition in person against Rhodes. For six months the brave\r\nknights, with their own good swords, unaided by a single European power,\r\nwithstood the whole array of the Ottoman empire; and when at length,\r\ncompelled to surrender, they obtained such honorable terms from Solyman\r\nas showed he knew how to respect valor, though in a Christian foe.\r\n\r\nOnce more without a home, the Knights of St. John were abroad on the\r\nworld. The European princes, affecting to consider the order as now\r\nextinct, prepared to confiscate whatever possessions it had in their\r\nseveral dominions. From this ruin it was saved by the exertions of\r\nL'Isle Adam, the grand-master, who showed, at this crisis, as much skill\r\nin diplomacy as he had before shown prowess in the field. He visited the\r\nprincipal courts in person, and by his insinuating address, as well as\r\narguments, not only turned the sovereigns from their purpose, but\r\nsecured effectual aid for his unfortunate brethren. The pope offered\r\nthem a temporary asylum in the papal territory; and Charles the Fifth\r\nwas induced to cede to the order the island of Malta, and its\r\ndependencies, with entire jurisdiction over them, for their permanent\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\nMalta, which had been annexed by Charles's predecessors to Sicily, had\r\ndescended to that monarch as part of the dominions of the crown of\r\nAragon. In thus ceding it to the Knights of St. John, the politic prince\r\nconsulted his own interests quite as much as those of the order. He drew\r\nno revenue from the rocky isle, but, on the contrary, was charged with\r\nits defence against the Moorish corsairs, who made frequent descents on\r\nthe spot, wasting the country, and dragging off the miserable people\r\ninto slavery. By this transfer of the island to the military order of\r\nSt. John, he not only relieved himself of all further expense on its\r\naccount, but secured a permanent bulwark for the protection of his own\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\nIt was wise in the emperor to consent that the gift should be burdened\r\nwith no other condition than the annual payment of a falcon in token of\r\nhis feudal supremacy. It was also stipulated, that the order should at\r\nno time bear arms against Sicily; a stipulation hardly necessary with\r\nmen who, by their vows, were pledged to fight in defence of Christendom,\r\nand not against it.[1292]\r\n\r\nIn October, 1530, L'Isle Adam and his brave associates took possession\r\nof their new domain. Their hearts sunk within them, as their eyes\r\nwandered over the rocky expanse, forming a sad contrast to the beautiful\r\n\"land of roses\" which had so long been their abode.[1293] But it was not\r\nvery long before the wilderness before them was to blossom like the rose\r\nunder their diligent culture.[1294] Earth was brought in large\r\nquantities, and at great cost, from Sicily. Terraces to receive it were\r\nhewn in the steep sides of the rock; and the soil, quickened by the\r\nardent sun of Malta, was soon clothed with the glowing vegetation of the\r\nsouth. Still, it did not raise the grain necessary for the consumption\r\nof the island. This was regularly imported from Sicily, and stored in\r\nlarge pits or caverns, excavated in the rock, which, hermetically\r\nclosed, preserved their contents unimpaired for years. In a short time,\r\ntoo, the island bristled with fortifications, which, combined with its\r\nnatural defences, enabled its garrison to defy the attacks of the\r\ncorsair. To these works was added the construction of suitable dwellings\r\nfor the accommodation of the order. But it was long after, and not until\r\nthe land had been desolated by the siege on which we are now to enter,\r\nthat it was crowned with the stately edifices which eclipsed those of\r\nRhodes itself, and made Malta the pride of the Mediterranean.[1295]\r\n\r\nIn their new position the knights were not very differently situated\r\nfrom what they had been in the Levant. They were still encamped amongst\r\nthe infidel, with the watch-fires of the enemy blazing around them.\r\nAgain their galleys sailed forth to battle with the corsairs, and\r\nreturned laden with the spoils of victory. Still the white cross of St.\r\nJohn was to be seen in the post of danger. In all the expeditions of\r\nCharles the Fifth and Philip the Second against the Barbary Moors, from\r\nthe siege of Tunis to the capture of Peñon de Velez, they bore a\r\nprominent part. With the bravery of the soldier, they combined the skill\r\nof the mariner; and on that disastrous day when the Christian navy was\r\nscattered before Algiers, the Maltese galleys were among the few that\r\nrode out the tempest.[1296] It was not long before the name of the\r\nKnights of Malta became as formidable on the southern shores of the\r\nMediterranean, as that of the Knights of Rhodes had been in the East.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LA VALETTE.]\r\n\r\nOccasionally their galleys, sweeping by the mouth of the Adriatic,\r\npassed into the Levant, and boldly encountered their old enemy on his\r\nown seas, even with odds greatly against them.[1297] The Moors of the\r\nBarbary coast, smarting under the losses inflicted on them by their\r\nindefatigable foe, more than once besought the sultan to come to their\r\naid, and avenge the insults offered to his religion on the heads of the\r\noffenders. At this juncture occurred the capture of a Turkish galleon in\r\nthe Levant. It was a huge vessel, richly laden, and defended by twenty\r\nguns and two hundred janizaries. After a desperate action, she was taken\r\nby the Maltese galleys, and borne off, a welcome prize, to the island.\r\nShe belonged to the chief eunuch of the imperial harem, some of the fair\r\ninmates of which were said to have had an interest in the precious\r\nfreight.[1298] These persons now joined with the Moors in the demand for\r\nvengeance. Solyman shared in the general indignation at the insult\r\noffered to him under the walls, as it were, of his own capital; and he\r\nresolved to signalize the close of his reign by driving the knights from\r\nMalta, as he had the commencement of it by driving them from Rhodes.\r\n\r\nAs it was not improbable that the Christian princes would rally in\r\nsupport of an order which had fought so many battles for Christendom,\r\nSolyman made his preparations on a formidable scale. Rumors of these\r\nspread far and wide; and, as their object was unknown, the great powers\r\non the Mediterranean, each fancying that its own dominions might be the\r\npoint of attack, lost no time in placing their coasts in a state of\r\ndefence. The king of Spain sent orders to his viceroy in Sicily to equip\r\nsuch a fleet as would secure the safety of that island.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the grand-master of Malta, by means of spies whom he secretly\r\nemployed in Constantinople, received intelligence of the real purpose of\r\nthe expedition. The post of grand-master, at this time, was held by Jean\r\nParisot de la Valette, a man whose extraordinary character, no less than\r\nthe circumstances in which he was placed, has secured him an\r\nimperishable name on the page of history. He was of an ancient family\r\nfrom the south of France, being of the _language_ of Provence. He was\r\nnow in the sixty-eighth year of his age.[1299] In his youth he had\r\nwitnessed the memorable siege of Rhodes, and had passed successively\r\nthrough every post in the order, from the humblest to the highest, which\r\nhe now occupied. With large experience he combined a singular\r\ndiscretion, and an inflexible spirit, founded on entire devotion to the\r\ngreat cause in which he was engaged. It was the conviction of this\r\nself-devotion which, in part, at least, may have given La Valette that\r\nascendancy over the minds of his brethren, which was so important at a\r\ncrisis like the present. It may have been the anticipation of such a\r\ncrisis that led to his election as grand-master in 1557, when the\r\ndarkness coming over the waters showed the necessity of an experienced\r\npilot to weather the storm.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the grand-master learned the true destination of the\r\nTurkish armament, than he sent his emissaries to the different Christian\r\npowers, soliciting aid for the order in its extremity. He summoned the\r\nknights absent in foreign lands to return to Malta, and take part with\r\ntheir brethren in the coming struggle. He imported large supplies of\r\nprovisions and military stores from Sicily and Spain. He drilled the\r\nmilitia of the island, and formed an effective body of more than three\r\nthousand men; to which was added a still greater number of Spanish and\r\nItalian troops, raised for him by the knights who were abroad. This\r\nforce was augmented by the extraordinary addition of five hundred\r\ngalley-slaves, whom La Valette withdrew from the oar, promising to give\r\nthem their freedom if they served him faithfully. Lastly, the\r\nfortifications were put in repair, strengthened with outworks, and\r\nplaced in the best condition for resisting the enemy. All classes of the\r\ninhabitants joined in this work. The knights themselves took their part\r\nin the toilsome drudgery; and the grand-master did not disdain to labor\r\nwith the humblest of his followers. He not only directed, but, as hands\r\nwere wanted, he set the example of carrying his own orders into\r\nexecution. Wherever his presence was needed, he was to be\r\nfound,--ministering to the sick, cheering the desponding, stimulating\r\nthe indifferent, chiding the dilatory, watching over the interests of\r\nthe little community intrusted to his care with parental solicitude.\r\n\r\nWhile thus employed, La Valette received a visit from the Sicilian\r\nviceroy, Don Garcia de Toledo, the conqueror of Peñon de Velez. He came,\r\nby Philip's orders, to concert with the grand-master the best means of\r\ndefence. He assured the latter that, so soon as he had assembled a\r\nfleet, he would come to his relief; and he left his natural son with\r\nhim, to learn the art of war under so experienced a commander. La\r\nValette was comforted by the viceroy's promises of succor. But he well\r\nknew that it was not to the promises of others he was to trust, in his\r\npresent exigency, but to his own efforts and those of his brave\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nThe knights, in obedience to his call, had for the most part now\r\narrived, each bringing with him a number of servants and other\r\nfollowers. Some few of the more aged and infirm remained behind; but\r\nthis not so much from infirmity and age, as from the importance of\r\nhaving some of its members to watch over the interests of the community\r\nat foreign courts. La Valette was touched by the alacrity with which his\r\nbrethren repaired to their posts, to stand by their order in the dark\r\nhour of its fortunes. He tenderly embraced them; and soon afterwards,\r\ncalling them together, he discoursed with them on the perilous position\r\nin which they stood, with the whole strength of the Moorish and Turkish\r\nempires mustering against them. \"It was the great battle of the Cross\r\nand the Koran,\" he said, \"that was now to be fought. They were the\r\nchosen soldiers of the Cross; and, if Heaven required the sacrifice of\r\ntheir lives, there could be no better time than this glorious occasion.\"\r\nThe grand-master then led the way to the chapel of the convent, where he\r\nand his brethren, after devoutly confessing, partook of the sacrament,\r\nand, at the foot of the altar, solemnly renewed their vows to defend the\r\nChurch against the infidel. With minds exalted by these spiritual\r\nexercises, all worldly interests seemed, from that moment, says their\r\nhistorian, to lose their hold on their affections. They stood like a\r\ncompany of martyrs,--the forlorn hope of Christendom, prepared, as their\r\nchief had said, to offer up their lives a sacrifice to the great cause\r\nin which they were engaged. Such were the feelings with which La Valette\r\nand his companions, having completed their preparations, now calmly\r\nawaited the coming of the enemy.[1300]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSIEGE OF MALTA.\r\n\r\nCondition of Malta.--Arrival of the Turks.--They reconnoitre the\r\nIsland.--Siege of St. Elmo.--Its Heroic Defence.--Its Fall.\r\n\r\n1565.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONDITION OF THE ISLAND.]\r\n\r\nBefore entering on the particulars of this memorable siege, it will be\r\nnecessary to make the reader somewhat acquainted with the country which\r\nwas the scene of operations. The island of Malta is about seventeen\r\nmiles long and nine broad. At the time of the siege it contained some\r\ntwelve thousand inhabitants, exclusive of the members of the order. They\r\nwere gathered, for the most part, into wretched towns and villages, the\r\nprincipal one of which was defended by a wall of some strength, and was\r\ndignified with the title of Civita Notable--\"Illustrious City.\" As it\r\nwas situated in the interior, near the centre of the island, the knights\r\ndid not take up their residence there, but preferred the north-eastern\r\npart of Malta, looking towards Sicily, and affording a commodious harbor\r\nfor their galleys.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the land in this quarter is very remarkable. A narrow,\r\nrocky promontory stretches out into the Mediterranean, dividing its\r\nwaters into two small gulfs,--that on the west being called _Marza\r\nMusiette_, or Port Musiette, and that towards the east, which now bears\r\nthe name of Valetta Harbor, being then known as the Great Port. The\r\nextreme point of the promontory was crowned by the Castle of St. Elmo,\r\nbuilt by the order, soon after its arrival in the island, on the spot\r\nwhich commanded the entrance into both harbors. It was a fortress of\r\nconsiderable strength, for which it was chiefly indebted to its\r\nposition. Planted on the solid rock, and washed, for the greater part of\r\nits circuit, by the waters of the Mediterranean, it needed no other\r\ndefence on that quarter. But towards the land it was more open to an\r\nenemy; and, though protected by a dry ditch and a counterscarp, it was\r\nthought necessary to secure it still further, by means of a ravelin on\r\nthe south-west, which La Valette had scarcely completed before the\r\narrival of the Turks.\r\n\r\nPort Musiette, on the west, is that in which vessels now perform\r\nquarantine. The Great Port was the most important; for round that was\r\ngathered the little community of knights. Its entrance, which is not\r\nmore than a quarter of a mile in width, is commanded by two headlands,\r\none of them crested, as above mentioned, by the fort of St. Elmo. The\r\nlength of the harbor may be nearly two miles; and the water is of\r\nsufficient depth for ships of the greatest burden to ride there in\r\nsecurity, sheltered within the encircling arms of the coast from the\r\nstorms of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nFrom the eastern side of this basin shoot out two projecting headlands,\r\nforming smaller harbors within the Great Port. The most northerly of\r\nthese strips of land was defended by the Castle of St. Angelo, round\r\nwhich clustered a little town, called by way of eminence _Il Borgo_,\r\n\"The Burgh,\"--now more proudly styled \"The Victorious City.\" It was here\r\nthat the order took up its residence,--the grand-masters establishing\r\nthemselves in the castle; and great pains were taken to put the latter\r\nin a good state of defence, while the town was protected by a wall. On\r\nthe parallel strip of land, known as the island of La Sangle, from a\r\ngrand-master of that name, stood a fort, called the fort of St. Michael,\r\nwith a straggling population gathered around it, now busily employed in\r\nstrengthening the defences. Between the two headlands lay the Port of\r\nGalleys, serving, as its name imports, as a haven for the little navy of\r\nthe order. This port was made more secure by an iron chain drawn across\r\nits entrance, from the extreme point of one headland to the other.\r\n\r\nSuch were the works constructed by the knights in the brief period\r\nduring which they had occupied the island. They were so far imperfect,\r\nthat many a commanding eminence, which the security of the country\r\nrequired to be strongly fortified, still remained as naked and exposed\r\nas at the time of their arrival. This imperfect state of its defences\r\npresented a strong contrast to the present condition of Malta, bristling\r\nall over with fortifications, which seem to form part of the living rock\r\nout of which they spring, and which, in the hands of a power that holds\r\npossession of the sea, might bid defiance to the world.\r\n\r\nThe whole force which La Valette could muster in defence of the island\r\namounted to about nine thousand men. This included seven hundred\r\nknights, of whom about six hundred had already arrived. The remainder\r\nwere on their way, and joined him at a later period of the siege.\r\nBetween three and four thousand were Maltese, irregularly trained, but\r\nwho had already gained some experience of war in their contests with the\r\nBarbary corsairs. The rest of the army, with the exception of five\r\nhundred galley slaves, already noticed, and the personal followers of\r\nthe knights, was made up of levies from Spain and Italy, who had come\r\nover to aid in the defence. The useless part of the population--the\r\ninfirm and the aged--had for the most part been shipped off to Sicily.\r\nThere still remained, however, numbers of women and children; and the\r\nformer, displaying the heroic constancy which, in times of trouble, so\r\noften distinguishes the sex, did good service during the siege, by\r\ntending the sick and by cheering the flagging spirits of the\r\nsoldier.[1301]\r\n\r\nThis little army La Valette distributed on the several stations,\r\nassigning each to some one of the _languages_, or nations, that the\r\nspirit of emulation might work its effects on the chivalry of the order.\r\nThe castle of St. Elmo was the point of first importance. It covered so\r\ncontracted a piece of ground, that it scarcely afforded accommodation\r\nfor a thousand men; and not more than eight hundred were shut up within\r\nits walls at the commencement of the siege.[1302] Its dimensions did not\r\nadmit of its being provided with magazines capable of holding any large\r\nquantity of provisions, or military stores, for which it was\r\nunfortunately obliged to rely on its communication with Il Borgo, the\r\ntown across the harbor. The masonry of the fort was not in the best\r\nrepute: though the works were lined with at least thirty pieces of\r\nartillery, looking chiefly towards the land. Its garrison, which usually\r\namounted to sixty soldiers, was under the command of an aged knight,\r\nnamed De Broglio. The grand-master reinforced this body with sixty\r\nknights under the bailiff of Negropont, a veteran in whose well-tried\r\nvalor La Valette placed entire confidence. He was strengthened by two\r\ncompanies of foreign levies, under the command of a Spanish cavalier\r\nnamed La Cerda.[1303]\r\n\r\nVarious other points were held by small detachments, with some one of\r\nthe order at the head of each. But the strength of the force, including\r\nnearly all the remainder of the knights, was posted in the castle of St.\r\nAngelo and in the town at its base. Here La Valette took his own\r\nstation, as the spot which, by its central position, would enable him to\r\nwatch over the interests of the whole. All was bustle in this quarter,\r\nas the people were busily employed in strengthening the defences of the\r\ntown, and in razing buildings in the suburbs, which the grand-master\r\nfeared might afford a lodgement to the enemy. In this work their labors\r\nwere aided by a thousand slaves, taken from the prison, and chained\r\ntogether in couples.[1304]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ARRIVAL OF THE TURKS.]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the eighteenth of May, 1565, the Turkish fleet was\r\ndescried by the sentinels of St. Elmo and St. Angelo, about thirty miles\r\nto the eastward, standing directly for Malta. A gun, the signal agreed\r\non, was fired from each of the forts, to warn the inhabitants of the\r\ncountry to withdraw into their villages. The fleet amounted to one\r\nhundred and thirty royal galleys with fifty of lesser size, besides a\r\nnumber of transports with the cannon, ammunition, and other military\r\nstores.[1305] The breaching artillery consisted of sixty-three guns, the\r\nsmallest of which threw a ball of fifty-six pounds, and some few, termed\r\n_basilicas_, carried marble bullets of a hundred and twelve pounds'\r\nweight.[1306] The Turks were celebrated for the enormous calibre of\r\ntheir guns, from a very early period; and they continued to employ those\r\npieces long after they had given way, in the rest of Europe, to cannon\r\nof more moderate and manageable dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe number of soldiers on board, independently of the mariners, and\r\nincluding six thousand janizaries, was about thirty thousand,--the\r\nflower of the Ottoman army.[1307] Their appointments were on the most\r\nperfect scale, and everything was provided requisite for the prosecution\r\nof the siege. Never, probably, had there been so magnificent an armament\r\nin the waters of the Mediterranean. It was evident that Solyman was bent\r\non the extermination of the order which he had once driven into exile,\r\nbut which had now renewed its strength, and become the most formidable\r\nenemy of the Crescent.\r\n\r\nThe command of the expedition was intrusted to two officers. One of\r\nthese, Piali, was the same admiral who defeated the Spaniards at Gelves.\r\nHe had the direction of the naval operations. The land forces were given\r\nto Mustapha, a veteran nearly seventy years of age, whose great\r\nexperience, combined with military talents of a high order, had raised\r\nhim to the head of his profession. Unfortunately, his merits as an\r\nofficer were tarnished by his cruelty. Besides the command of the army,\r\nhe had a general authority over the whole expedition, which excited the\r\njealousy of Piali, who thought himself injured by the preference given\r\nto his rival. Thus feelings of mutual distrust arose in the bosoms of\r\nthe two chiefs, which to some extent paralyzed the operations of each.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish armada steered for the south-eastern quarter of the island,\r\nand cast anchor in the port of St. Thomas. The troops speedily\r\ndisembarked, and spread themselves in detached bodies over the land,\r\ndevastating the country, and falling on all stragglers whom they met in\r\nthe fields. Mustapha, with the main body of the army, marching a short\r\ndistance into the interior, occupied a rising ground, only a few miles\r\nfrom Il Borgo. It was with difficulty that the inhabitants could be\r\nprevented from issuing from the gates, in order to gaze on the show\r\npresented by the invaders, whose magnificent array stretched far beyond\r\nthe hills, with their bright arms and banners glittering in the sun, and\r\ntheir warlike music breathing forth notes of defiance to the Christians.\r\nLa Valette, in his turn, caused the standard of St. John to be unfurled\r\nfrom the ramparts of the castle, and his trumpets to answer in a similar\r\nstrain of defiance to that of the enemy.[1308]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the grand marshal, Coppier, had sallied from the town at the\r\nhead of a small troop, and fallen upon some of the detachments which\r\nwere scouring the country. The success of his arms was shown by the gory\r\nheads of the slaughtered Turks, which he sent back to Il Borgo as the\r\ntrophies of victory.[1309] La Valette's design, in permitting these\r\nencounters, was to familiarize his men with the novel aspect and\r\npeculiar weapons of their enemies, as well as with the fierce war-cries\r\nwhich the Turks raised in battle. But the advantages gained in these\r\nskirmishes did not compensate the losses, however light, on the part of\r\nthe Christians; and after two knights and a number of the common file\r\nhad been slain, the grand-master ordered his followers to remain quietly\r\nwithin the walls of the town.\r\n\r\nIt was decided, in the Turkish council of war, to begin operations with\r\nthe siege of the castle of St. Elmo; as the possession of this place was\r\nnecessary to secure a safe harbor for the Turkish fleet. On the\r\ntwenty-fourth of May, the trenches were opened, if that can be said\r\nwhere, from the rocky, impenetrable nature of the ground, no trenches\r\ncould be dug, and the besiegers were obliged to shelter themselves\r\nbehind a breastwork formed of planks, having the space between them\r\nfilled with earth brought from a distance, and held together by straw\r\nand rushes. At certain intervals Mustapha indicated the points for\r\nbatteries. The principal of these was a battery where ten guns were\r\nmounted, some of them of the largest calibre; and although artillery\r\npractice was very different from what it is in our times, with so much\r\ngreater experience and more manageable engines, yet masonry stronger\r\nthan that of St. Elmo might well have crumbled under the masses of stone\r\nand iron that were now hurled against it.\r\n\r\nAs the works began to give way, it seemed evident that the garrison must\r\nrely more on their own strength than on that of their defences. It was\r\nresolved, therefore, to send to the grand-master and request\r\nreinforcements. The Chevalier de la Cerda was intrusted with the\r\nmission. Crossing over to Il Borgo, he presented himself before La\r\nValette, and insisted on the necessity of further support if the fort\r\nwas to be maintained against the infidel. The grand-master listened,\r\nwith a displeasure which he could not conceal, to this application for\r\naid so early in the siege; especially as it was made in the presence of\r\nmany of the knights, who might well be disheartened by it. He coldly\r\nasked La Cerda what loss the garrison had suffered. The knight, evading\r\nthe question, replied, that St. Elmo was in the condition of a sick man\r\nwho requires the aid of the physician. \"I will be the physician,\" said\r\nLa Valette, \"and will bring such aid that, if I cannot cure your fears,\r\nI may at least hope to save the place from falling into the hands of the\r\nenemy.\" So impressed was he with the importance of maintaining this post\r\nto the last extremity, if it were only to gain time for the Sicilian\r\nsuccors, that he was prepared, as he said, to throw himself into the\r\nfortress, and, if need were, to bury himself in its ruins.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OPERATIONS AGAINST ST. ELMO.]\r\n\r\nFrom this desperate resolution he was dissuaded by the unanimous voice\r\nof the knights, who represented to him that it was not the duty of the\r\ncommander-in-chief to expose himself like a common soldier, and take his\r\nplace in the forlorn hope. The grand-master saw the justice of these\r\nremonstrances; and, as the knights contended with one another for the\r\nhonor of assuming the post of danger, he allowed fifty of the order,\r\ntogether with two companies of soldiers, to return with La Cerda to the\r\nfort. The reinforcement was placed under command of the Chevalier de\r\nMedran, a gallant soldier, on whose constancy and courage La Valette\r\nknew he could rely. Before its departure, the strength of the force was\r\nincreased by the arrival of several knights from Sicily, who obtained\r\nthe grand-master's leave to share the fortunes of their brethren in St.\r\nElmo. The troops were sent across the harbor, together with supplies of\r\nfood and ammunition, in open boats, under cover of a heavy fire from the\r\nguns of St. Angelo. A shot happened to fall on a stone near the\r\ntrenches, in which Piali, the Turkish admiral, was standing; and, a\r\nsplinter striking him on the head, he was severely, though not mortally\r\nwounded. La Valette took advantage of the confusion created by this\r\nincident to despatch a galley to Sicily, to quicken the operations of\r\nthe viceroy, and obtain from him the promised succors. To this Don\r\nGarcia de Toledo replied by an assurance that he should come to his\r\nrelief by the middle of June.[1310]\r\n\r\nIt was now the beginning of that month. Scarcely had De Medran entered\r\nSt. Elmo, when he headed a sally against the Turks, slew many in the\r\ntrenches, and put the remainder to flight. But they soon returned in\r\nsuch overwhelming force as compelled the Christians to retreat and take\r\nrefuge within their works. Unfortunately, the smoke of the musketry,\r\nborne along by a southerly breeze, drifted in the direction of the\r\ncastle; and under cover of it, the Turks succeeded in getting possession\r\nof the counterscarp. As the smoke cleared away, the garrison were\r\ngreatly dismayed at seeing the Moslem standard planted on their own\r\ndefences. It was in vain they made every effort to recover them. The\r\nassailants, speedily intrenching themselves behind a parapet formed of\r\ngabions, fascines, and wool-sacks, established a permanent lodgement on\r\nthe counterscarp.\r\n\r\nFrom this point, they kept up a lively discharge of musketry on the\r\nravelin, killing such of its defenders as ventured to show themselves.\r\nAn untoward event soon put them in possession of the ravelin itself. A\r\nTurkish engineer, reconnoitring that outwork from the counterscarp, is\r\nsaid to have perceived a sentinel asleep on his post. He gave notice to\r\nhis countrymen; and a party of janizaries succeeded, by means of their\r\nladders, in scaling the walls of the ravelin. The guard, though few in\r\nnumber and taken by surprise, still endeavored to maintain the place. A\r\nsharp skirmish ensued. But the Turks, speedily reinforced by their\r\ncomrades, who flocked to their support, overpowered the Christians, and\r\nforced them to give way. Some few succeeded in effecting their retreat\r\ninto the castle. The janizaries followed close on the fugitives. For a\r\nmoment it seemed as if Moslem and Christian would both be hurried along\r\nby the tide of battle into the fort itself. But fortunately the bailiff\r\nof Negropont, De Medran, and some other cavaliers, heading their\r\nfollowers, threw themselves on the enemy, and checked the pursuit. A\r\ndesperate struggle ensued, in which science was of no avail, and victory\r\nwaited on the strongest. In the end the janizaries were forced to\r\nretreat in their turn. Every inch of ground was contested; until the\r\nTurks, pressed hard by their adversaries, fell back into the ravelin,\r\nwhere, with the aid of their comrades, they made a resolute stand\r\nagainst the Christians. Two cannon of the fortress were now brought to\r\nbear on the outwork. But, though their volleys told with murderous\r\neffect, the Turks threw themselves into the midst of the fire, and\r\nfearlessly toiled, until, by means of gabions, sand-bags, and other\r\nmaterials, they had built up a parapet which secured them from\r\nannoyance. All further contest was rendered useless; and the knights,\r\nabandoning this important outwork to the assailants, sullenly withdrew\r\ninto the fortress.[1311]\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on, a fresh body of Turks, bursting into the ditch,\r\nthrough a breach in the counterscarp, endeavored to carry the fortress\r\nby escalade. Fortunately, their ladders were too short; and the\r\ngarrison, plying them with volleys of musketry, poured down, at the same\r\ntime, such a torrent of missiles on their heads as soon strewed the\r\nditch with mangled limbs and carcasses. At this moment a party, sallying\r\nfrom the fort, fell on the enemy with great slaughter, and drove\r\nthem--such as were in condition to fly--back into their trenches.\r\n\r\nThe engagement, brought on, as we have seen, by accident, lasted several\r\nhours. The loss of the Turks greatly exceeded that of the garrison,\r\nwhich amounted to less than a hundred men, twenty of whom were members\r\nof the order. But the greatest loss of the besieged was that of the\r\ncounterscarp and ravelin. Thus shorn of its outworks, the castle of St.\r\nElmo stood like some bare and solitary trunk exposed to all the fury of\r\nthe tempest.[1312]\r\n\r\nThe loss of the ravelin gave the deepest concern to La Valette, which\r\nwas not mitigated by the consideration that it was to be charged, in\r\npart at least, on the negligence of its defenders. It made him the more\r\nsolicitous to provide for the security of the castle; and he sent his\r\nboats over to remove the wounded, and replace them by an equal number of\r\nable-bodied knights and soldiers. It was his intention that the garrison\r\nshould not be encumbered with any who were unable to assist in the\r\ndefence. Among the new recruits was the Chevalier de Miranda,--one of\r\nthe most illustrious members of the order, who had lately arrived from\r\nSicily,--a soldier whose personal authority, combined with great\r\nmilitary knowledge, proved eminently useful to the garrison.\r\n\r\nThe loss which the besiegers had sustained in the late encounter was\r\nmore than counterbalanced by the arrival, at this time, of Dragut, the\r\nfamous pasha of Tripoli, with thirteen Moorish galleys. He was welcomed\r\nby salvos of artillery and the general rejoicing of the army; and this\r\nnot so much on account of the reinforcement which he brought--the want\r\nof which was not then felt--as of his reputation; for he was no less\r\ncelebrated as an engineer than as a naval commander. The sultan, who had\r\nthe highest opinion of his merits, had ordered his generals to show him\r\nthe greatest deference; and they, at once, advised with him as to the\r\nbest means of prosecuting the siege. The effect of his counsel was soon\r\nseen in the more judicious and efficient measures that were adopted. A\r\nbattery of four culverins was established on the western headland\r\ncommanding the entrance of Port Musiette. It was designed to operate on\r\nthe western flank of the fortress; and the point of land on which it\r\nstood is still known by the name of the redoubtable corsair.\r\n\r\nAnother battery, much more formidable from the number and size of the\r\npieces, was raised on an eminence to the south of St. Elmo, and played\r\nboth upon that fort and upon the castle of St. Angelo. The counterscarp\r\nof the former fortress was shaved away, so as to allow a free range to\r\nthe artillery of the besiegers;[1313] and two cannon were planted on the\r\nravelin, which directed a searching fire on the interior of the\r\nfortress, compelling the garrison to shelter themselves behind\r\nretrenchments constructed under the direction of Miranda.[1314]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HEROIC DEFENCE OF ST. ELMO.]\r\n\r\nThe artillery of the Turks now opened with dreadful effect, as they\r\nconcentrated their fire on the naked walls of St. Elmo. No masonry could\r\nlong withstand the tempest of iron and ponderous marble shot which was\r\nhurled from the gigantic engines of the besiegers. Fragments of the wall\r\nfell off as if it had been made of plaster; and St. Elmo trembled to its\r\nfoundations under the thunders of the terrible ordnance. The heart of\r\nthe stoutest warrior might well have faltered as he saw the rents each\r\nday growing wider and wider, as if gaping to give entrance to the fierce\r\nmultitude that was swarming at the gates.\r\n\r\nIn this extremity, with the garrison wasted by the constant firing of\r\nthe enemy, worn down by excessive toil, many of the knights wounded, all\r\nof them harassed by long-protracted vigils, it was natural that the\r\ngreater part should feel that they had done all that duty required of\r\nthem, and that, without loss of honor, they might retire from a post\r\nthat was no longer tenable. They accordingly resolved to apply to the\r\ngrand-master to send his boats at once to transport them and the rest of\r\nthe garrison to Il Borgo. The person whom they chose for the mission was\r\nthe Chevalier de Medran, who, as La Valette would know, was not likely\r\nto exaggerate the difficulties of their situation.\r\n\r\nDe Medran accordingly crossed the harbor, and, in an interview with the\r\ngrand-master, explained the purpose of his visit. He spoke of the\r\ndilapidated state of the fortifications, and dwelt on the forlorn\r\ncondition of the garrison, which was only to be sustained by constant\r\nreinforcements from Il Borgo. But this was merely another mode of\r\nconsuming the strength of the order. It would be better, therefore,\r\ninstead of prolonging a desperate defence, which must end in the ruin of\r\nthe defenders, to remove them at once to the town, where they could make\r\ncommon cause with their brethren against the enemy.\r\n\r\nLa Valette listened attentively to De Medran's arguments, which were\r\nwell deserving of consideration. But, as the affair was of the last\r\nimportance to the interests of his little community, he chose to lay it\r\nbefore the council of _Grand Crosses_,--men who filled the highest\r\nstations in the order. They were unanimously of the same opinion as De\r\nMedran. Not so was La Valette. He felt that with the maintenance of St.\r\nElmo was connected the very existence of the order. The viceroy of\r\nSicily, he told his brethren, had declared that, if this strong post\r\nwere in the hands of the enemy, he would not hazard his master's fleet\r\nthere to save the island. And, next to their own good swords, it was on\r\nthe Sicilian succors that they must rely. The knights must maintain the\r\npost at all hazards. The viceroy could not abandon them in their need.\r\nHe himself would not desert, them. He would keep them well supplied with\r\nwhatever was required for their defence; and, if necessary, would go\r\nover and take the command in person, and make good the place against the\r\ninfidel, or die in the breach.\r\n\r\nThe elder knights, on learning the grand-master's decision, declared\r\ntheir resolution to abide by it. They knew how lightly he held his life\r\nin comparison with the cause to which it was consecrated; and they\r\navowed their determination to shed the last drop of their blood in\r\ndefence of the post intrusted to them. The younger brethren were not so\r\neasily reconciled to the decision of their superiors. To remain there\r\nlonger was a wanton sacrifice of life, they said. They were penned up\r\nin the fort, like sheep, tamely waiting to be devoured by the fierce\r\nwolves that were thirsting for their blood. This they could not endure;\r\nand, if the grand-master did not send to take them off at once, they\r\nwould sally out against the enemy, and find an honorable death on the\r\nfield of battle. A letter signed by fifty of the knights, expressing\r\ntheir determination, was accordingly despatched by one of their number\r\nto Il Borgo.\r\n\r\nLa Valette received the communication with feelings in which sorrow was\r\nmingled with indignation. It was not enough, he said, for them to die\r\nthe honorable death which they so much coveted. They must die in the\r\nmanner he prescribed. They were bound to obey his commands. He reminded\r\nthem of the vows taken at the time of their profession, and the\r\nobligation of every loyal knight to sacrifice his life, if necessary,\r\nfor the good of the order. Nor would they gain anything, he added, by\r\nabandoning their post and returning to the town. The Turkish army would\r\nsoon be at its gates, and the viceroy of Sicily would leave them to\r\ntheir fate.\r\n\r\nThat he might not appear, however, to pass too lightly by their\r\nremonstrances, La Valette determined to send three commissioners to\r\ninspect St. Elmo, and report on its condition. This would at least have\r\nthe advantage of gaining time, when every hour gained was of importance.\r\nHe also sent to Sicily to remonstrate on the tardiness of the viceroy's\r\nmovements, and to urge the necessity of immediate succors if he would\r\nsave the castle.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners were received with joy by the refractory knights, whom\r\nthey found so intent on their departure that they were already beginning\r\nto throw the shot into the wells, to prevent its falling into the hands\r\nof the Turks. They eagerly showed the commissioners every part of the\r\nworks, the ruinous condition of which, indeed, spoke more forcibly than\r\nthe murmurs of the garrison. Two of the body adopted the views of the\r\ndisaffected party, and pronounced the fort no longer tenable. But the\r\nthird, an Italian cavalier, named Castriot, was of a different way of\r\nthinking. The fortifications, he admitted, were in a bad state; but it\r\nwas far from a desperate one. With fresh troops and the materials that\r\ncould be furnished from the town, they might soon be put in condition to\r\nhold out for some time longer. Such an opinion, so boldly avowed, in\r\nopposition to the complaints of the knights, touched their honor. A hot\r\ndispute arose between the parties; and evil consequences might have\r\nensued, had not the commander, De Broglio, and the bailiff of Negropont,\r\nto stop the tumult, caused the alarm-bell to be rung, which sent every\r\nknight to his post.\r\n\r\nCastriot, on his return, made a similar report to the grand-master, and\r\nboldly offered to make good his words. If La Valette would allow him to\r\nmuster a force, he would pass over to St. Elmo, and put it in condition\r\nstill to hold out against the Ottoman arms.\r\n\r\nLa Valette readily assented to a proposal which he may perhaps have\r\noriginally suggested. No compulsion was to be used in a service of so\r\nmuch danger. But volunteers speedily came forward, knights, soldiers,\r\nand inhabitants of both town and country. The only difficulty was in\r\nmaking the selection. All eagerly contended for the glory of being\r\nenrolled in this little band of heroes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HEROIC DEFENCE OF ST. ELMO.]\r\n\r\nLa Valette was cheered by the exhibition of this generous spirit in his\r\nfollowers. It gave assurance of success stronger than was to be derived\r\nfrom any foreign aid. He wrote at once to the discontented knights in\r\nSt. Elmo, and informed them of what had been done. Their petition was\r\nnow granted. They should be relieved that very evening. They had only to\r\nresign their posts to their successors. \"Return, my brethren,\" he\r\nconcluded, \"to the convent. There you will be safe for the present; and\r\nI shall have less apprehension for the fate of the fortress, on which\r\nthe preservation of the island so much depends.\"\r\n\r\nThe knights, who had received some intimation of the course the affair\r\nwas taking in Il Borgo, were greatly disconcerted by it. To surrender to\r\nothers the post committed to their own keeping, would be a dishonor they\r\ncould not endure. When the letter of the grand-master arrived, their\r\nmortification was extreme; and it was not diminished by the cool and\r\ncutting contempt but thinly veiled under a show of solicitude for their\r\npersonal safety. They implored the bailiff of Negropont to write in\r\ntheir name to La Valette, and beseech him not to subject them to such a\r\ndisgrace. They avowed their penitence for the course they had taken, and\r\nonly asked that they might now be allowed to give such proofs of\r\ndevotion to the cause as should atone for their errors.\r\n\r\nThe letter was despatched by a swimmer across the harbor. But the\r\ngrand-master coldly answered, that veterans without subordination were\r\nin his eyes of less worth than raw recruits who submitted to discipline.\r\nThe wretchedness of the knights at this repulse was unspeakable; for in\r\ntheir eyes dishonor was far worse than death. In their extremity they\r\naddressed themselves again to La Valette, renewing their protestations\r\nof sorrow for the past, and in humble terms requesting his forgiveness.\r\nThe chief felt that he had pushed the matter far enough. It was perhaps\r\nthe point to which he had intended to bring it. It would not be well to\r\ndrive his followers to despair. He felt now they might be trusted. He\r\naccordingly dismissed the levies, retaining only a part of these brave\r\nmen to reinforce the garrison; and with them he sent supplies of\r\nammunition, and materials for repairing the battered works.[1315]\r\n\r\nDuring this time, the Turkish commander was pressing the siege with\r\nvigor. Day and night, the batteries thundered on the ramparts of the\r\ndevoted fortress. The ditch was strewed with fragments torn from the\r\nwalls by the iron tempest; and a yawning chasm, which had been gradually\r\nopening on the south-western side of the castle, showed that a\r\npracticable breach was at length effected. The uncommon vivacity with\r\nwhich the guns played through the whole of the fifteenth of June, and\r\nthe false alarms with which the garrison was harassed on the following\r\nnight, led to the belief that a general assault was immediately\r\nintended. The supposition was correct. On the sixteenth, at dawn, the\r\nwhole force of the besiegers was under arms. The appointed signal was\r\ngiven by the discharge of a cannon; when a numerous body of janizaries,\r\nformed into column, moved swiftly forward to storm the great breach of\r\nthe castle.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Ottoman fleet, having left its anchorage on the eastern\r\nside of the island, had moved round, and now lay off the mouth of the\r\nGreat Port, where its heavy guns were soon brought to bear on the\r\nseaward side of St. Elmo. The battery on Point Dragut opened on the\r\nwestern flank of the fortress; and four thousand musketeers in the\r\ntrenches swept the breach with showers of bullets, and picked off those\r\nof the garrison who showed their heads above the parapet.\r\n\r\nThe guns of the besieged, during this time, were not idle. They boldly\r\nanswered the cannonade of the vessels; and on the land side the play of\r\nartillery and musketry was incessant. The besieged now concentrated\r\ntheir aim on the formidable body of janizaries, who, as already\r\nnoticed, were hurrying forward to the assault. Their leading files were\r\nmowed down, and their flank cruelly torn, by the cannon of St. Angelo,\r\nat less than half a mile's distance. But though staggered by this double\r\nfire on front and flank, the janizaries were not stayed in their career,\r\nnor even thrown into disarray. Heedless of those who fell, the dark\r\ncolumn came steadily on, like a thundercloud; while the groans of the\r\ndying were drowned in the loud battle-cries with which their comrades\r\nrushed to the assault. The fosse, choked up with the ruins of the\r\nramparts, afforded a bridge to the assailants, who had no need of the\r\nfascines with which their pioneers were prepared to fill up the chasm.\r\nThe approach of the breach, however, was somewhat steep; and the breach\r\nitself was defended by a body of knights and soldiers, who poured\r\nvolleys of musketry thick as hail on the assailants. Still they pushed\r\nforward through the storm, and, after a fierce struggle, the front rank\r\nfound itself at the summit, face to face with its enemies. But the\r\nstrength of the Turks was nearly exhausted by their efforts. They were\r\nhewn down by the Christians, who came fresh into action. Yet others\r\nsucceeded those who fell; till, thus out-numbered, the knights began to\r\nlose ground, and the forces were more equally matched. Then came the\r\nstruggle of man against man, where each party was spurred on by the fury\r\nof religious hate, and Christian and Moslem looked to paradise as the\r\nreward of him who fell in battle against the infidel. No mercy was\r\nasked; none was shown; and long and hard was the conflict between the\r\nflower of the Moslem soldiery and the best knights of Christendom. In\r\nthe heat of the fight an audacious Turk planted his standard on the\r\nrampart. But it was speedily wenched away by the Chevalier de Medran,\r\nwho cut down the Mussulman, and at the same moment received a mortal\r\nwound from an arquebuse.[1316] As the contest lasted far into the day,\r\nthe heat became intense, and added sorely to the distress of the\r\ncombatants. Still neither party slackened their efforts. Though several\r\ntimes repulsed, the Turks returned to the assault with the same spirit\r\nas before; and when sabre and scymitar were broken, the combatants\r\nclosed with their daggers, and rolled down the declivity of the breach,\r\nstruggling in mortal conflict with each other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HEROIC DEFENCE OF ST. ELMO.]\r\n\r\nWhile the work of death was going on in this quarter, a vigorous attempt\r\nwas made in another to carry the fortress by escalade. A body of Turks,\r\npenetrating into the fosse, raised their ladders against the walls, and,\r\npushed forward by their comrades in the rear, endeavored to force an\r\nascent, under a plunging fire of musketry from the garrison. Fragments\r\nof rook, logs of wood, ponderous iron shot, were rolled over the\r\nparapet, mingled with combustibles and hand-grenades, which, exploding\r\nas they descended, shattered the ladders, and hurled the mangled bodies\r\nof the assailants on the rocky bottom of the ditch. In this contest one\r\ninvention proved of singular use to the besieged. It was furnished them\r\nby La Valette, and consisted of an iron hoop, wound round with cloth\r\nsteeped in nitre and bituminous substances, which, when ignited, burned\r\nwith inextinguishable fury. These hoops, thrown on the assailants,\r\ninclosed them in their fiery circles. Sometimes two were thus imprisoned\r\nin the same hoop; and, as the flowing dress of the Turks favored the\r\nconflagration, they were speedily wrapped in a blaze which scorched them\r\nseverely, if it did not burn them to death.[1317] This invention, so\r\nsimple,--and rude, as in our day it might be thought,--was so disastrous\r\nin its effects, that it was held in more dread by the Turks than any\r\nother of the fireworks employed by the besieged.\r\n\r\nA similar attempt to scale the walls was made on the other side of the\r\ncastle, but was defeated by a well-directed fire from the guns of St.\r\nAngelo across the harbor,--which threw their shot with such precision as\r\nto destroy most of the storming party, and compel the rest to abandon\r\ntheir design.[1318] Indeed, during the whole of the assault, the\r\nartillery of St. Angelo, St. Michael, and Il Borgo kept up so irritating\r\na fire on the exposed flank and rear of the enemy as greatly embarrassed\r\nhis movements, and did good service to the besieged.\r\n\r\nThus the battle raged along the water and on the land. The whole circuit\r\nof the Great Port was studded with fire. A din of hideous noises rose in\r\nthe air; the roar of cannon, the rattle of musketry, the hissing of\r\nfiery missiles, the crash of falling masonry, the shrieks of the dying,\r\nand, high above all, the fierce cries of those who struggled for\r\nmastery! To add to the tumult, in the heat of the fight, a spark falling\r\ninto the magazine of combustibles in the fortress, it blew up with a\r\ntremendous explosion, drowning every other noise, and for a moment\r\nstilling the combat. A cloud of smoke and vapor, rising into the air,\r\nsettled heavily, like a dark canopy, above St. Elmo. It seemed as if a\r\nvolcano had suddenly burst from the peaceful waters of the\r\nMediterranean, belching out volumes of fire and smoke, and shaking the\r\nisland to its centre!\r\n\r\nThe fight had lasted for some hours; and still the little band of\r\nChristian warriors made good their stand against the overwhelming odds\r\nof numbers. The sun had now risen high in the heavens, and as its rays\r\nbeat fiercely on the heads of the assailants, their impetuosity began to\r\nslacken. At length, faint with heat and excessive toil, and many\r\nstaggering under wounds, it was with difficulty that the janizaries\r\ncould be brought back to the attack; and Mustapha saw with chagrin that\r\nSt. Elmo was not to be won that day. Soon after noon, he gave the signal\r\nto retreat; and the Moslem host, drawing off under a galling fire from\r\nthe garrison, fell back in sullen silence into their trenches, as the\r\ntiger, baffled in his expected prey, takes refuge from the spear of the\r\nhunter in his jungle.[1319]\r\n\r\nAs the Turks withdrew, the garrison of St. Elmo raised a shout of\r\nvictory that reached across the waters, and was cheerily answered from\r\nboth St. Angelo and the town, whose inhabitants had watched with intense\r\ninterest the current of the fight, on the result of which their own fate\r\nso much depended.\r\n\r\nThe number of Moslems who perished in the assault can only be\r\nconjectured. But it must have been very large. That of the garrison is\r\nstated as high as three hundred men. Of these, seventeen were knights of\r\nthe order. But the common soldier, it was observed, did his duty as\r\nmanfully throughout the day as the best knight by whose side he\r\nfought.[1320] Few, if any, of the survivors escaped without wounds.\r\nSuck as were badly injured were transferred at once to the town, and an\r\nequal number of able-bodied troops sent to replace them, together with\r\nsupplies of ammunition, and materials for repairing, as far as possible,\r\nthe damage to the works. Among those who suffered most from their wounds\r\nwas the bailiff of Negropont. He obstinately refused to be removed to\r\nthe town; and when urged by La Valette to allow a substitute to be sent\r\nto relieve him, the veteran answered, that he was ready to yield up his\r\ncommand to any one who should be appointed in his place; but he trusted\r\nhe should be allowed still to remain in St. Elmo, and shed the last drop\r\nof his blood in defence of the Faith.[1321]\r\n\r\nA similar heroic spirit was shown in the competition of the knights, and\r\neven of the Maltese soldiers, to take the place of those who had fallen\r\nin the fortress. It was now not merely the post of danger, but, as might\r\nbe truly said, the post of death. Yet these brave men eagerly contended\r\nfor it, as for the palm of glory; and La Valette was obliged to refuse\r\nthe application of twelve knights of the _language_ of Italy, on the\r\nground that the complement of the garrison was full.\r\n\r\nThe only spark of hope now left was that of receiving the succors from\r\nSicily. But the viceroy, far from quickening his movements, seemed\r\nwilling to play the part of the _matador_ in one of his national\r\nbull-fights,--allowing the contending parties in the arena to exhaust\r\nthemselves in the struggle, and reserving his own appearance till a\r\nsingle thrust from his sword should decide the combat.\r\n\r\nStill, some chance of prolonging its existence remained to St. Elmo\r\nwhile the communication could be maintained with St. Angelo and the\r\ntown, by means of which the sinking strength of the garrison was\r\ncontinually renewed with the fresh life-blood that was poured into its\r\nveins. The Turkish commander at length became aware that, if he would\r\nend the siege, this communication must be cut off. It would have been\r\nwell for him had he come to this conclusion sooner.\r\n\r\nBy the advice of Dragut, the investment of the castle was to be\r\ncompleted by continuing the lines of intrenchment to the Great Port,\r\nwhere a battery mounted with heavy guns would command the point of\r\ndebarkation. While conducting this work, the Moorish captain was wounded\r\non the head, by the splinter from a rock struck by a cannon-shot, which\r\nlaid him senseless in the trenches. Mustapha, commanding a cloak to be\r\nthrown over the fallen chief, had him removed to his tent. The wound\r\nproved mortal; and though Dragut survived to learn the fate of St. Elmo,\r\nhe seems to have been in no condition to aid the siege by his counsels.\r\nThe loss of this able captain was the severest blow that could have been\r\ninflicted on the besiegers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HEROIC DEFENCE OF ST. ELMO.]\r\n\r\nWhile the intrenchments were in progress, the enemy kept up an\r\nunintermitting fire on the tottering ramparts of the fortress. This was\r\naccompanied by false alarms, and by night attacks, in which the flaming\r\nmissiles, as they shot through the air, cast a momentary glare over the\r\nwaters, that showed the dark outlines of St. Elmo towering in ruined\r\nmajesty above the scene of desolation. The artillery-men of St. Angelo,\r\nin the obscurity of the night, were guided in their aim by the light of\r\nthe enemy's fireworks.[1322] These attacks were made by the Turks, not\r\nso much in the expectation of carrying the fort, though they were often\r\nattended with a considerable loss of life, as for the purpose of wearing\r\nout the strength of the garrison. And dreary indeed was the condition of\r\nthe latter: fighting by day, toiling through the livelong night to\r\nrepair the ravages in the works, they had no power to take either the\r\nrest or the nourishment necessary to recruit their exhausted strength.\r\nTo all this was now to be added a feeling of deeper despondency, as they\r\nsaw the iron band closing around them which was to sever them for ever\r\nfrom their friends.\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth of the month, the work of investment was completed,\r\nand the extremity of the lines was garnished with a redoubt mounting two\r\nlarge guns, which, with the musketry from the trenches, would sweep the\r\nlanding-place, and effectually cut off any further supplies from the\r\nother side of the harbor. Thus left to their own resources, the days of\r\nthe garrison were numbered.\r\n\r\nLa Valette, who had anxiously witnessed these operations of the enemy,\r\nhad done all he could to retard them, by firing incessantly on the\r\nlaborers in the hope of driving them from the trenches. When the work\r\nwas completed, his soul was filled with anguish; and his noble features,\r\nwhich usually wore a tinge of melancholy, were clouded with deeper\r\nsadness, as he felt he must now abandon his brave comrades to their\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nOn the twentieth of the month was the festival of Corpus Christi, which,\r\nin happier days, had been always celebrated with great pomp by the\r\nHospitallers. They did not fail to observe it, even at this time. A\r\nprocession was formed, with the grand-master at its head; and the\r\nknights walked clad in the dark robes of the order, embroidered with the\r\nwhite cross of Malta. They were accompanied by the whole population of\r\nthe place, men, women, and children. They made the circuit of the town,\r\ntaking the direction least exposed to the enemy's fire. On reaching the\r\nchurch, they prostrated themselves on the ground, and, with feelings\r\nrendered yet more solemn by their own situation, and above all by that\r\nof their brave comrades in St. Elmo, they implored the Lord of Hosts to\r\ntake pity on their distress, and not to allow his enemies to triumph\r\nover the true soldiers of the Cross.[1323]\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the twenty-first, the fire of the besiegers was kept\r\nup with more than usual severity, until in some places the crumbling\r\nwall was shot away, down to the bare rock on which it stood.[1324] Their\r\npioneers, who had collected loads of brushwood for the purpose, filled\r\nup the ditch with their fascines; which, as they were covered with wet\r\nearth, defied the efforts of the garrison to set them on fire.\r\nThroughout the following night a succession of false alarms kept the\r\nsoldiers constantly under arms. All this prognosticated a general\r\nassault. It came the next day.\r\n\r\nWith the earliest streak of light, the Turkish troops were in motion.\r\nSoon they came pouring in over the fosse, which, choked up as it was,\r\noffered no impediment. Some threw themselves on the breach. The knights\r\nand their followers were there to receive them. Others endeavored to\r\nscale the ramparts, but were driven back by showers of missiles. The\r\nmusketry was feeble, for ammunition had begun to fail. But everywhere\r\nthe assailants were met with the same unconquerable spirit as before. It\r\nseemed as if the defenders of St. Elmo, exhausted as they had been by\r\ntheir extraordinary sufferings, had renewed their strength as by a\r\nmiracle. Thrice the enemy returned to the assault; and thrice he was\r\nrepulsed. The carnage was terrible; Christian and Mussulman grappling\r\nfiercely together, until the ruins on which they fought were heaped with\r\nthe bodies of the slain.\r\n\r\nThe combat had lasted several hours. Amazed at the resistance which he\r\nmet with from this handful of warriors, Mustapha felt that, if he would\r\nstop the waste of life in his followers, he must defer the possession of\r\nthe place for one day longer. Stunned as his enemies must be by the blow\r\nhe had now dealt, it would be beyond the powers of nature for them to\r\nstand another assault. He accordingly again gave the signal for retreat;\r\nand the victors again raised the shout--a feeble shout--of triumph;\r\nwhile the banner of the order, floating from the ramparts, proclaimed\r\nthat St. Elmo was still in the hands of the Christians! It was the last\r\ntriumph of the garrison.[1325]\r\n\r\nThey were indeed reduced to extremity; with their ammunition nearly\r\nexhausted; their weapons battered and broken; their fortifications\r\nyawning with breaches, like some tempest-tossed vessel with its seams\r\nopening in every direction, and ready to founder; the few survivors\r\ncovered with wounds; and many of them so far crippled as to be scarcely\r\nable to drag their enfeebled body along the ramparts. One more attack,\r\nand the scene would be closed.\r\n\r\nIn this deplorable state, they determined to make an effort to\r\ncommunicate with their friends on the other side of the harbor, and\r\nreport to them their condition. The distance was not great; and among\r\nthe Maltese were many excellent swimmers, who, trained from childhood to\r\nthe sea, took to it as to their native element. One of these offered to\r\nbear a message to the grand-master. Diving and swimming long under\r\nwater, he was fortunate enough to escape the enemy's bullets, and landed\r\nsafe on the opposite shore.\r\n\r\nLa Valette was deeply affected by this story, though not surprised by\r\nit. With the rest of the knights he had watched with straining eyes the\r\ncourse of the fight; and though marvelling that, in spite of odds so\r\ngreat, victory should have remained with the Christians, he knew how\r\ndearly they must have bought it. Though with little confidence in his\r\nsuccess, he resolved to answer their appeal by making one effort to aid\r\nthem. Five large barges were instantly launched, and furnished with a\r\nreinforcement of troops and supplies for the garrison. The knights\r\nthronged to the quay, each eagerly contending for the perilous right to\r\nembark in them. They thought only of their comrades in St. Elmo.\r\n\r\nIt turned out as La Valette had foreseen. The landing-place was\r\ncommanded by a battery of heavy guns, and by hundreds of musketeers,\r\nmenacing instant death to whoever should approach the shore. But the\r\nknights were not allowed to approach it; for the Turkish admiral, lying\r\noff the entrance of the Great Port, and aware of the preparations that\r\nwere making, sent a flotilla of his lighter vessels into the harbor, to\r\nintercept the convoy. And so prompt were their movements, that unless\r\nthe Christians had put back again with all speed, they would have been\r\nat once surrounded and captured by the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe defenders of St. Elmo, who had watched from the ramparts the boats\r\ncoming to their assistance, saw the failure of the attempt; and the last\r\nray of hope faded away in their bosoms. Their doom was sealed. Little\r\nmore was left but calmly to await the stroke of the executioner. Yet\r\nthey did not abandon themselves to an unmanly despair; but, with heroic\r\nconstancy, they prepared to die like martyrs for the good cause to which\r\nthey had consecrated their lives.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of St. Elmo.]\r\n\r\nThat night was passed, not in vain efforts to repair the defences, with\r\nthe hope of protracting existence some few hours longer, but in the\r\nsolemn preparation of men who felt themselves standing on the brink of\r\neternity. They prayed, confessed, received the sacrament, and, exhorting\r\none another to do their duty, again renewed their vows, which bound them\r\nto lay down their lives, if necessary, in defence of the Faith. Some,\r\namong whom Miranda and the bailiff of Negropont were especially noticed,\r\nwent about encouraging and consoling their brethren, and, though covered\r\nwith wounds themselves, administering such comfort as they could to the\r\nsick and the dying;--and the dying lay thick around, mingled with the\r\ndead, on the ruins which were soon to become their common\r\nsepulchre.[1326]\r\n\r\nThus passed away the dreary night; when, tenderly embracing one another,\r\nlike friends who part for ever, each good knight repaired to his post,\r\nprepared to sell his life as dearly as he could. Some of the more aged\r\nand infirm, and those crippled by their wounds, were borne in the arms\r\nof their comrades to the spot, where, seated on the ruins, and wielding\r\ntheir ineffectual swords, they prepared, like true and loyal knights, to\r\ndie upon the breach.\r\n\r\nThey did not wait long. The Turks, so often balked of their prey, called\r\nloudly to be led to the assault. Their advance was not checked by the\r\nfeeble volleys thrown at random against them from the fortress; and they\r\nwere soon climbing the ascent of the breach, still slippery with the\r\ncarnage of the preceding day. But with all their numbers, it was long\r\nbefore they could break the little line of Maltese chivalry which was\r\nthere to receive them. Incredible as it may seem, the struggle lasted\r\nfor some hours longer, while the fate of St. Elmo hung suspended in the\r\nbalance. At length, after a short respite, the Turkish host rallied for\r\na last assault; and the tide of battle, pouring through the ample breach\r\nwith irresistible fury, bore down cavalier and soldier, leaving no\r\nliving thing upon the ramparts. A small party of knights, escaping in\r\nthe tumult, threw themselves into the chapel; but, finding that no\r\nquarter was given to those who surrendered, they rushed out, and\r\nperished on the swords of the enemy. A body of nine cavaliers, posted\r\nnear the end of the fosse, not far from the ground occupied by Dragut's\r\nmen, surrendered themselves as prisoners of war to the corsairs; and the\r\nlatter, who, in their piratical trade, had learned to regard men as a\r\nkind of merchandise, happily refused to deliver up the Christians to the\r\nTurks, holding them for ransom. These were the only members of the order\r\nwho survived the massacre.[1327] A few Maltese soldiers, however,\r\nexperienced swimmers, succeeded, amidst the tumult, in reaching the\r\nopposite side of the harbor, where they spread the sad tidings of the\r\nloss of St. Elmo. This was speedily confirmed by the volleys of the\r\nTurkish ordnance; and the standard of the Crescent, planted on the spot\r\nso lately occupied by the banner of St. John, showed too plainly that\r\nthis strong post, the key of the island, had passed from the Christians\r\ninto the hands of the infidel.[1328]\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman fleet, soon afterward doubling the point, entered Port\r\nMusiette, on the west, with music playing, and gay with pennons and\r\nstreamers; while the rocks rang with the shouts of the Turkish soldiery,\r\nand the batteries on shore replied in thunders to the artillery of the\r\nshipping.\r\n\r\nThe day on which this occurred, the twenty-third of June, was that of\r\nthe festival of St. John the Baptist, the patron of the order. It had\r\nbeen always celebrated by the knights with greater splendor than any\r\nother anniversary. Now, alas! it was to them a day of humiliation and\r\nmourning, while they had the additional mortification to see it observed\r\nas a day of triumphant jubilee by the enemies of the Faith.[1329]\r\n\r\nTo add to their distress, Mustapha sullied his victory by some brutal\r\nacts, which seem to have been in keeping with his character. The heads\r\nof four of the principal knights, among them those of Miranda and the\r\nbailiff of Negropont, were set high on poles looking towards the town. A\r\nspectacle yet more shocking was presented to the eyes of the besieged.\r\nThe Turkish general caused the bodies of several cavaliers--some of\r\nthem, it is said, while life was yet palpitating within, them--to be\r\nscored on the bosoms with gashes in the form of a cross. Thus defaced,\r\nthey were lashed to planks, and thrown into the water. Several of them\r\ndrifted to the opposite shore, where they were easily recognized by\r\ntheir brethren; and La Valette, as he gazed on the dishonored remains of\r\nhis dear companions, was melted to tears. But grief soon yielded to\r\nfeelings of a sterner nature. He commanded the heads of his Turkish\r\nprisoners to be struck off, and shot from the large guns into the\r\nenemy's lines,--by way of teaching the Moslems, as the chronicler tells\r\nus, a lesson of humanity![1330]\r\n\r\nThe number of Christians who fell in this siege amounted to about\r\nfifteen hundred. Of these one hundred and twenty-three were members of\r\nthe order, and among them several of its most illustrious\r\nwarriors.[1331] The Turkish loss is estimated at eight thousand, at the\r\nhead of whom stood Dragut, of more account than a legion of the common\r\nfile. He was still living, though speechless, when the fort was stormed.\r\nHe was roused from his lethargy by the shouts of victory, and when, upon\r\nturning with inquiring looks to those around, he was told the cause, he\r\nraised his eyes to Heaven, as if in gratitude for the event, and\r\nexpired.[1332]\r\n\r\nThe Turkish commander, dismantling St. Elmo,--which, indeed, was little\r\nbetter than a heap of ruins,--sent some thirty cannon that had lined the\r\nworks, as the trophies of victory, to Constantinople.[1333]\r\n\r\nThus ended the memorable siege of St. Elmo, in which a handful of\r\nwarriors withstood, for the space of a month, the whole strength of the\r\nTurkish army. Such a result, while it proves the unconquerable valor of\r\nthe garrison, intimates that the Turks, however efficient they may have\r\nbeen in field operations, had little skill as engineers, and no\r\nacquaintance with the true principles of conducting a siege. It must\r\nhave been obvious, from the first, that, to bring the siege to a speedy\r\nissue, it was necessary to destroy the communications of St. Elmo with\r\nthe town. Yet this was not attempted till the arrival of Dragut, who\r\nearly recommended the construction of a battery for this purpose on some\r\nhigh land on the opposite side of the Great Port. In this he was\r\noverruled by the Turkish commander. It was not till some time later that\r\nthe line of investment, at the corsair's suggestion, was continued to\r\nthe water's edge,--and the fate of the fortress was decided.\r\n\r\nSt. Elmo fell. But precious time had been lost,--an irreparable loss, as\r\nit proved, to the besiegers; while the place had maintained so long and\r\ngallant a resistance as greatly to encourage the Christians, and in some\r\ndegree to diminish the confidence of the Moslems. \"What will not the\r\nparent cost,\" exclaimed Mustapha,--alluding to St. Angelo,--\"when the\r\nchild has cost us so dear!\"[1334]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSIEGE OF MALTA.\r\n\r\nIl Borgo invested.--Storming of St. Michael.--Slaughter of the\r\nTurks.--Incessant Cannonade.--General Assault.--The Turks\r\nrepulsed.--Perilous Condition of Il Borgo.--Constancy of La Valette.\r\n\r\n1565.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strength of the order was now concentrated on the two narrow slips\r\nof land which run out from the eastern side of the Great Port. Although\r\nsome account of these places has been given to the reader, it will not\r\nbe amiss to refresh his recollection of what is henceforth to be the\r\nscene of operations.\r\n\r\nThe northern peninsula, occupied by the town of Il Borgo, and at the\r\nextreme point by the castle of St. Angelo, was defended by works\r\nstronger and in better condition than the fortifications of St. Elmo.\r\nThe care of them was divided among the different _languages_, each of\r\nwhich gave its own name to the bastion it defended. Thus the Spanish\r\nknights were intrusted with the bastion of Castile, on the eastern\r\ncorner of the peninsula,--destined to make an important figure in the\r\nensuing siege.\r\n\r\nThe parallel slip of land was crowned by the fort of St. Michael,--a\r\nwork of narrower dimensions than the castle of St. Angelo,--at the base\r\nof which might be seen a small gathering of houses, hardly deserving the\r\nname of a town. This peninsula was surrounded by fortifications scarcely\r\nyet completed, on which the grand-master, La Sangle, who gave his name\r\nto the place, had generously expended his private fortune. The works\r\nwere terminated, on the extreme point, by a low bastion, or rather\r\ndemi-bastion, called the Spur.\r\n\r\nThe precious interval gained by the long detention of the Turks before\r\nSt. Elmo had been diligently employed by La Valette in putting the\r\ndefences of both La Sangle and Il Borgo in the best condition possible\r\nunder the circumstances. In this good work all united,--men, women, and\r\nchildren. All were animated by the same patriotic feeling, and by a\r\ncommon hatred of the infidel. La Valette ordered the heavy guns to be\r\ntaken from the galleys which were lying at anchor, and placed on the\r\nwalls of the fortresses. He directed that such provisions as were in the\r\nhands of individuals should be delivered up for a fair compensation, and\r\ntransferred to the public magazines.[1335] Five companies of soldiers,\r\nstationed in the Notable City, in the interior of the island, he now\r\nordered to Il Borgo, where their services would be more needed. Finally,\r\nas there were no accommodations for prisoners, who, indeed, could not be\r\nmaintained without encroaching on the supplies necessary for the\r\ngarrison, La Valette commanded that no prisoners should be made, but\r\nthat all who fell into the hands of the victors should be put to the\r\nsword.[1336] It was to be on both sides a war of extermination.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ENVOY FROM THE TURKS.]\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, La Valette had the satisfaction of receiving a\r\nreinforcement from Sicily, which, though not large, was of great\r\nimportance in the present state of affairs. The viceroy had, at length,\r\nso far yielded to the importunities of the Knights of St. John who were\r\nthen at his court, impatiently waiting for the means of joining their\r\nbrethren, as to fit out a squadron of four galleys,--two of his own, and\r\ntwo belonging to the order. They had forty knights on board, and seven\r\nhundred soldiers, excellent troops, drawn chiefly from the Spanish\r\ngarrisons in Italy. The vessels were placed under command of Don Juan de\r\nCardona, who was instructed to return without attempting to land, should\r\nhe find St. Elmo in the hands of the enemy. Cardona, who seems to have\r\nhad a good share of the timid, vacillating policy of his superior,\r\nfearful of the Ottoman fleet, stood off and on for some days, without\r\napproaching the island. During this time St. Elmo was taken. Cardona,\r\nignorant of the fact, steered towards the south, and finally anchored\r\noff Pietra Negra, on the opposite side of the island. Here one of the\r\nknights was permitted to go on shore to collect information. He there\r\nlearned the fate of St. Elmo; but, as he carefully concealed the\r\ntidings, the rest of the forces were speedily landed, and Cardona, with\r\nhis galleys, was soon on the way to Sicily.\r\n\r\nThe detachment was under the command of the Chevalier de Robles, a brave\r\nsoldier, and one of the most illustrious men of the order. Under cover\r\nof night, he passed within gunshot of the Turkish lines without being\r\ndiscovered, and was so fortunate as to bring his men in safety to the\r\nside of the English harbor opposite to Il Borgo, which it washes on the\r\nnorth. There he found boats awaiting his arrival. They had been provided\r\nby the grand-master, who was advised of his movements. A thick fog lay\r\nupon the waters; and under its friendly mantle Robles and his troops\r\ncrossed over in safety to the town, where they were welcomed by the\r\nknights, who joyfully greeted the brave companions that had come to\r\nshare with them the perils of the siege.[1337]\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on, Mustapha, the Turkish commander, had been\r\nrevolving in his mind, whether it were not possible to gain his ends by\r\nnegotiation instead of war, and thus be spared the waste of life which\r\nthe capture of St. Elmo had cost him. He flattered himself that La\r\nValette, taking warning by the fate of that fortress, might be brought\r\nto capitulate on fair and honorable terms. He accordingly sent a\r\nmessenger with a summons to the grand-master to deliver up the island,\r\non the assurance of a free passage for himself and his followers, with\r\nall their effects, to Sicily.\r\n\r\nThe envoy chosen was a Greek slave,--an old man, who had lived from\r\nboyhood in captivity. Under protection of a flag of truce, the slave\r\ngained admission into St. Angelo, and was conducted blindfold to the\r\npresence of the grand-master. He there delivered his message. La Valette\r\ncalmly listened, but without deigning to reply; and when the speaker had\r\nended, the stern chief ordered him to be taken from his presence, and\r\ninstantly hanged. The wretched man threw himself at the feet of the\r\ngrand-master, beseeching him to spare his life, and protesting that he\r\nwas but a poor slave, and had come, against his will, in obedience to\r\nthe commands of the Turkish general. La Valette, who had probably no\r\nintention from the first to have his order carried into execution,\r\naffected to relent, declaring, however, that, should any other messenger\r\nventure hereafter to insult him with the like proposals, he should not\r\nescape so easily. The terrified old man was then dismissed. As he left\r\nthe presence, he was led through long files of the soldiery drawn up in\r\nimposing array, and was shown the strong works of the castle of St.\r\nAngelo. \"Look,\" said one of the officers, pointing to the deep ditch\r\nwhich surrounded the fortress, \"there is all the room we can afford your\r\nmaster; but it is deep enough to bury him and his followers!\" The slave,\r\nthough a Christian, could not be persuaded to remain and take his chance\r\nwith the besieged. They must be beaten in the end, he said, and, when\r\nretaken by the Turks, his case would be worse than ever.[1338]\r\n\r\nThere was now no alternative for Mustapha but to fight; and he had not\r\nlost a moment since the fall of St. Elmo in pushing forward his\r\npreparations. Trenches had been opened on the heights at the foot of\r\nMount Coradin, at the southern extremity of the Great Port, and\r\ncontinued on a line that stretched to Mount St. Salvador. Where the soil\r\nwas too hard to be readily turned up, the defences were continued by a\r\nwall of stone. Along the heights, on different points of the line,\r\nbatteries were established, and mounted with guns of the heaviest\r\ncalibre. Batteries were also raised on the high ground which, under the\r\nname of Mount Sceberras, divides Port Musiette from the Great Port,\r\nterminating in the point of land crowned by St. Elmo. A few cannon were\r\neven planted by the Turks on the ruins of this castle.\r\n\r\nThus the Christian fortresses were menaced on every point; and while the\r\nlines of the besiegers cut off all communication on the land side, a\r\ndetachment of the fleet, blocking up the entrance to the Great Port,\r\neffectually cut off intercourse by sea. The investment by land and by\r\nsea was complete.\r\n\r\nEarly in July the wide circle of batteries, mounting between sixty and\r\nseventy pieces of artillery, opened their converging fire on the\r\nfortresses, the towns, and the shipping, which lay at anchor in the Port\r\nof Galleys. The cannonade was returned with spirit by the guns of St.\r\nAngelo and St. Michael, well served by men acquainted with their duty.\r\nSo soon as the breaches were practicable, Mustapha proposed to begin by\r\nstorming St. Michael, the weaker of the two fortresses; and he\r\ndetermined to make the assault by sea as well as by land. It would not\r\nbe possible, however, to bring round his vessels lying in Port Musiette\r\ninto the Great Port, without exposing them to the guns of St. Angelo. He\r\nresorted, therefore, to an expedient startling enough, but not new in\r\nthe annals of warfare. He caused a large number of boats to be dragged\r\nacross the high land which divides the two harbors. This toilsome work\r\nwas performed by his Christian slaves; and the garrison beheld with\r\nastonishment the Turkish flotilla descending the rugged slopes of the\r\nopposite eminence, and finally launched on the waters of the inland\r\nbasin. No less than eighty boats, some of them of the largest size, were\r\nthus transported across the heights.\r\n\r\nHaving completed this great work, Mustapha made his preparations for the\r\nassault. At this time, he was joined by a considerable reinforcement\r\nunder Hassem, the Algerine corsair, who commanded at the memorable\r\nsieges of Oran and Mazarquivir. Struck with the small size of the castle\r\nof St. Elmo, Hassem intimated his surprise that it should have held out\r\nso long against the Turkish arms; and he besought Mustapha to intrust\r\nhim with the conduct of the assault that was to be made on Fort St.\r\nMichael. The Turkish general, not unwilling that the presumptuous young\r\nchief should himself prove the temper of the Maltese swords, readily\r\ngave him the command, and the day was fixed for the attack.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STORMING OF ST. MICHAEL.]\r\n\r\nFortunately, at this time, a deserter, a man of some consequence in the\r\nTurkish army, crossed over to Il Borgo, and acquainted the grand-master\r\nwith the designs of the enemy. La Sangle was defended on the north, as\r\nalready noticed, by a strong iron chain, which, stretching across the\r\nPort of Galleys at its mouth, would prevent the approach of boats in\r\nthat direction. La Valette now caused a row of palisades to be sunk in\r\nthe mud, at the bottom of the harbor, in a line extending from the\r\nextreme point of La Sangle to the foot of Mount Coradin. These were\r\nbound together by heavy chains, so well secured as to oppose an\r\neffectual barrier to the passage of the Turkish flotilla. The length of\r\nthis barricade was not great. But it was a work of much difficulty,--not\r\nthe less so that it was necessary to perform it in the night, in order\r\nto secure the workmen from the enemy's guns. In little more than a week,\r\nit was accomplished. Mustapha sent a small body of men, excellent\r\nswimmers, armed with axes, to force an opening in the barrier. They had\r\ndone some mischief to the work, when a party of Maltese, swimming out,\r\nwith their swords between their teeth, fell on the Turks, beat them off,\r\nand succeeded in restoring the palisades.[1339]\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, on the fifteenth of July, two cannon in the\r\nOttoman lines, from opposite sides of the Great Port, gave the signal\r\nfor the assault. Hassem prepared to lead it, in person, on the land\r\nside. The attack by water he intrusted to an Algerine corsair, his\r\nlieutenant. Before the report of the cannon had died away, a great\r\nnumber of boats were seen by the garrison of St. Michael putting off\r\nfrom the shore. They were filled with troops, and among these, to judge\r\nfrom their dress, were many persons of condition. The account is given\r\nby the old soldier so often quoted, who, stationed on the bastion of the\r\nSpur, had a full view of the enemy. It was a gay spectacle, these Moslem\r\nchiefs, in their rich Oriental costumes, with their gaudy-colored\r\nturbans, and their loose, flowing mantles of crimson, or of cloth of\r\ngold and silver; the beams of the rising sun glancing on their polished\r\nweapons,--their bows of delicate workmanship, their scymitars from the\r\nforges of Alexandria and Damascus, their muskets of Fez.[1340] \"It was a\r\nbeautiful sight to see,\" adds the chronicler with some _naïveté_, \"if\r\none could have looked on it without danger to himself.\"[1341]\r\n\r\nIn advance of the squadron came two or three boats, bearing persons\r\nwhose venerable aspect and dark-colored robes proclaimed them to be the\r\nreligious men of the Moslems. They seemed to be reciting from a volume\r\nbefore them, and muttering what might be prayers to Allah,--possibly\r\ninvoking his vengeance on the infidel. But these soon dropped astern,\r\nleaving the way open for the rest of the flotilla, which steered for the\r\npalisades, with the intention evidently of forcing a passage. But the\r\nbarrier proved too strong for their efforts; and, chafed by the musketry\r\nwhich now opened on them from the bastion, the Algerine commander threw\r\nhimself into the water, which was somewhat above his girdle, and,\r\nfollowed by his men, advanced boldly towards the shore.\r\n\r\nTwo mortars were mounted on the rampart. But, through some\r\nmismanagement, they were not worked; and the assailants were allowed to\r\nreach the foot of the bastion, which they prepared to carry by escalade.\r\nApplying their ladders, they speedily began to mount; when they were\r\nassailed by showers of stones, hand-grenades, and combustibles of\r\nvarious kinds; while huge fragments of rock were rolled over the\r\nparapet, crushing men and ladders, and scattering them in ruin below.\r\nThe ramparts were covered with knights and soldiers, among whom the\r\nstately form of Antonio de Zanoguerra, the commander of the post, was\r\nconspicuous, towering above his comrades, and cheering them on to the\r\nfight. Meantime the assailants, mustering like a swarm of hornets to the\r\nattack, were soon seen replacing the broken ladders, and again\r\nclambering up the walls. The leading files were pushed upward by those\r\nbelow; yet scarcely had the bold adventurers risen above the parapet,\r\nwhen they were pierced by the pikes of the soldiers, or struck down by\r\nthe swords and battle-axes of the knights. At this crisis, a spark\r\nunfortunately falling into the magazine of combustibles, it took fire,\r\nand blew up with a terrific explosion, killing or maiming numbers of the\r\ngarrison, and rolling volumes of blinding smoke along the bastion. The\r\nbesiegers profited by the confusion to gain a footing on the ramparts;\r\nand when the clouds of vapor began to dissipate, the garrison were\r\nastonished to find their enemies at their side, and a number of small\r\nbanners, such as the Turks usually bore into the fight, planted on the\r\nwalls. The contest now raged fiercer than ever, as the parties fought on\r\nmore equal terms;--the Mussulmans smarting under their wounds, and the\r\nChristians fired with the recollection of St. Elmo, and the desire of\r\navenging their slaughtered brethren. The struggle continued long after\r\nthe sun, rising high in the heavens, poured down a flood of heat on the\r\ncombatants; and the garrison, pressed by superior numbers, weary and\r\nfaint with wounds, were hardly able to keep their footing on the\r\nslippery ground, saturated with their own blood and that of their\r\nenemies. Still the cheering battle-cry of St. John rose in the air; and\r\ntheir brave leader, Zanoguerra, at the head of his knights, was to be\r\nseen in the thickest of the fight. There too was Brother Robert, an\r\necclesiastic of the order, with a sword in one hand and a crucifix in\r\nthe other, though wounded himself, rushing among the ranks, and\r\nexhorting the men \"to fight for the faith of Jesus Christ, and to die in\r\nits defence.\"[1342]\r\n\r\nAt this crisis the commander, Zanoguerra, though clad in armor of proof,\r\nwas hit by a random musket-shot, which stretched him lifeless on the\r\nrampart. At his fall the besiegers set up a shout of triumph, and\r\nredoubled their efforts. It would now have gone hard with the garrison,\r\nhad it not been for a timely reinforcement which arrived from Il Borgo.\r\nIt was sent by La Valette, who had learned the perilous state of the\r\nbastion. He had, not long before this, caused a floating bridge to be\r\nlaid across the Port of Galleys,--thus connecting the two peninsulas\r\nwith each other, and affording a much readier means of communication\r\nthan before existed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SLAUGHTER OF THE TURKS.]\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on, a powerful reinforcement was on its way to the\r\nsupport of the assailants. Ten boats of the largest size, having a\r\nthousand janizaries on board, were seen advancing across the Great\r\nHarbor from the opposite shore. Taking warning by the fate of their\r\ncountrymen, they avoided the palisades, and, pursuing a more northerly\r\ncourse, stood for the extreme point of the Spur. By so doing, they\r\nexposed themselves to the fire of a battery in St. Angelo, sunk down\r\nalmost to the water's level. It was this depressed condition of the work\r\nthat secured it from the notice of the Turks. The battery, mounted with\r\nfive guns, was commanded, by the Chevalier de Guiral, who coolly waited\r\nuntil the enemy had come within range of his shot, when he gave the word\r\nto fire. The pieces were loaded with heavy balls, and with bags filled\r\nwith chain and bits of iron. The effect of the discharge was terrible.\r\nNine of the barges were shattered to pieces, and immediately sunk.[1343]\r\nThe water was covered with the splinters of the vessels, with mutilated\r\ntrunks, dissevered limbs, fragments of clothes, and quantities of\r\nprovisions; for the enemy came prepared to take up their quarters\r\npermanently in the fortress. Amidst the dismal wreck a few wretches were\r\nto be seen, struggling with the waves, and calling on their comrades for\r\nhelp. But those in the surviving boat, when they had recovered from the\r\nshock of the explosion, had no mind to remain longer in so perilous a\r\nposition, but made the best of their way back to the shore, leaving\r\ntheir companions to their fate. Day after day the waves threw upon the\r\nstrand the corpses of the drowned men; and the Maltese divers long\r\ncontinued to drag up from the bottom rich articles of wearing apparel,\r\nornaments, and even purses of money, which had been upon the persons of\r\nthe janizaries. Eight hundred are said to have perished by this\r\ndisaster, which may, not improbably, have decided the fate of the\r\nfortress; for the strength of the reinforcement would have been more\r\nthan a match for that sent by La Valette to the support of the\r\ngarrison.[1344]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the succors detached by the grand-master had no sooner entered\r\nthe bastion, than, seeing their brethren so hard beset, and the Moslem\r\nflags planted along the parapet, they cried their war-cry, and fell\r\nfuriously on the enemy. In this they were well supported by the\r\ngarrison, who gathered strength at the sight of the reinforcement. The\r\nTurks, now pressed on all sides, gave way. Some succeeded in making\r\ntheir escape by the ladders, as they had entered. Others were hurled\r\ndown on the rocks below. Most, turning on their assailants, fell\r\nfighting on the rampart which they had so nearly won. Those who escaped\r\nhurried to the shore, hoping to gain the boats, which lay off at some\r\ndistance; when a detachment, sallying from the bastion, intercepted\r\ntheir flight. Thus at bay, they had no alternative but to fight. But\r\ntheir spirit was gone; and they were easily hewed down by their\r\npursuers. Some, throwing themselves on their knees, piteously begged for\r\nmercy. \"Such mercy,\" shouted the victors, \"as you showed at St.\r\nElmo!\"[1345] and buried their daggers in their bodies.\r\n\r\nWhile this bloody work was going on below, the knights and soldiers,\r\ngathered on the exposed points of the bastion above, presented an\r\nobvious mark to the Turkish guns across the water, which had not been\r\nworked during the assault, for fear of injuring the assailants. Now that\r\nthe Turks had vanished from the ramparts, some heavy shot were thrown\r\namong the Christians, with fatal effect. Among others who were slain was\r\nFrederic de Toledo, a son of the viceroy of Sicily. He was a young\r\nknight of great promise, and was under the especial care of the\r\ngrand-master, who kept him constantly near his person. But when the\r\ngenerous youth learned the extremity to which his brethren in La Sangle\r\nwere reduced, he secretly joined the reinforcement which was going to\r\ntheir relief, and did his duty like a good knight in the combat which\r\nfollowed. While on the rampart, he was struck down by a cannon-shot; and\r\na splinter from his cuirass mortally wounded a comrade to whom he was\r\nspeaking at the time.\r\n\r\nWhile the fight was thus going on at the Spur, Hassem was storming the\r\nbreach of Fort St. Michael, on the opposite quarter. The storming-party,\r\nconsisting of both Moors and Turks, rushed to the assault with their\r\nusual intrepidity. But they found a very different enemy from the\r\nspectral forms which, wasted by toil and suffering, had opposed so\r\nineffectual a resistance in the last days of St. Elmo. In vain did the\r\nrushing tide of assailants endeavor to force an opening through the\r\nstern array of warriors, which, like a wall of iron, now filled up the\r\nbreach. Recoiling in confusion, the leading files fell back upon the\r\nrear, and all was disorder. But Hassem soon re-formed his ranks, and\r\nagain led them to the charge. Again they were repulsed with loss; but as\r\nfresh troops came to their aid, the little garrison must have been borne\r\ndown by numbers, had not their comrades, flushed with their recent\r\nvictory at the bastion, hurried to their support, and, sweeping like a\r\nwhirlwind through the breach, driven the enemy with dreadful carnage\r\nalong the slope, and compelled him to take refuge in his trenches.\r\n\r\nThus ended the first assault of the besiegers since the fall of St.\r\nElmo. The success of the Christians was complete. Between three and four\r\nthousand Mussulmans, including those who were drowned,--according to the\r\nMaltese statements,--fell in the two attacks on the fortress and the\r\nbastion. But the arithmetic of an enemy is not apt to be exact.[1346]\r\nThe loss of the Christians did not exceed two hundred. Even this was a\r\nheavy loss to the besieged, and included some of their best knights, to\r\nsay nothing of others disabled by their wounds. Still it was a signal\r\nvictory; and its influence was felt in raising the spirits of the\r\nbesieged, and in inspiring them with confidence. La Valette was careful\r\nto cherish these feelings. The knights, followed by the whole population\r\nof Il Borgo, went in solemn procession to the great church of St.\r\nLawrence, where _Te Deum_ was chanted, while the colors taken from the\r\ninfidel were suspended from the walls as glorious trophies of the\r\nvictory.[1347]\r\n\r\nMustapha now found that the spirit of the besieged, far from being\r\nbroken by their late reverses, was higher than ever, as their resources\r\nwere greater, and their fortifications stronger, than those of St. Elmo.\r\nHe saw the necessity of proceeding with greater caution. He resolved to\r\nlevel the defences of the Christians with the ground, and then,\r\ncombining the whole strength of his forces, make simultaneous assaults\r\non Il Borgo and St. Michael. His first step was to continue his line of\r\nintrenchments below St. Salvador to the water's edge, and thus cut off\r\nthe enemy's communication with the opposite side of the English Port, by\r\nmeans of which the late reinforcement from Sicily had reached him. He\r\nfurther strengthened the battery on St. Salvador, arming it with sixteen\r\nguns,--two of them of such enormous calibre, as to throw stone bullets\r\nof three hundred pounds' weight.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INCESSANT CANNONADE.]\r\n\r\nFrom this ponderous battery he now opened a crushing fire on the\r\nneighboring bastion of Castile, and on the quarter of Il Borgo lying\r\nnearest to it. The storm of marble and metal that fell upon the houses,\r\nthough these were built of stone, soon laid many of than in ruins; and\r\nthe shot, sweeping the streets, killed numbers of the inhabitants,\r\nincluding women and children. La Valette caused barriers of solid\r\nmasonry to be raised across the streets for the protection of the\r\ncitizens. As this was a work of great danger, he put his slaves upon it,\r\ntrusting, too, that the enemy might be induced to mitigate his fire from\r\ntenderness for the lives of his Moslem brethren. But in such an\r\nexpectation he greatly erred. More than five hundred slaves fell under\r\nthe incessant volleys of the besiegers; and it was only by the most\r\nsevere, indeed cruel treatment, that these unfortunate beings could be\r\nmade to resume their labors.[1348]\r\n\r\nLa Valette, at this time, in order to protect the town against assault\r\non the side of the English Port, caused a number of vessels laden with\r\nheavy stones to be sunk not far from shore. They were further secured by\r\nanchors bound to one another with chains, forming altogether an\r\nimpenetrable barrier against any approach by water.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Il Borgo, as well as the soldiers, were now active in\r\npreparations for defence. Some untwisted large ropes and cables to get\r\nmaterials for making bags to serve as gabions. Some were busy with\r\nmanufacturing different sorts of fireworks, much relied on as a means of\r\ndefence by the besieged. Others were employed in breaking up the large\r\nstones from the ruined buildings into smaller ones, which proved\r\nefficient missiles when hurled on the heads of the assailants below. But\r\nthe greatest and most incessant labor was that of repairing the\r\nbreaches, or of constructing retrenchments to defend them. The sound of\r\nthe hammer and the saw was everywhere to be heard. The fires of the\r\nforges were never suffered to go out. The hum of labor was as\r\nunintermitting throughout the city as in the season of peace;--but with\r\na very different end.[1349]\r\n\r\nOver all these labors the grand-master exercised a careful\r\nsuperintendence. He was always on the spot where his presence was\r\nneeded. His eye seemed never to slumber. He performed many of the duties\r\nof a soldier, as well as of a commander. He made the rounds constantly\r\nin the night, to see that all was well, and that the sentinels were at\r\ntheir posts. On these occasions he freely exposed himself to danger,\r\nshowing a carelessness of his own safety that called forth more than\r\nonce the remonstrances of his brethren. He was indeed watchful over all,\r\nsays the old chronicler who witnessed it; showing no sign of\r\napprehension in his valiant countenance, but by his noble presence\r\ngiving heart and animation to his followers.[1350]\r\n\r\nYet the stoutest heart which witnessed the scene might well have\r\nthrilled with apprehension. Far as the eye could reach, the lines of the\r\nMoslem army stretched over hill and valley; while a deafening roar of\r\nartillery from fourteen batteries shook the solid earth, and, borne\r\nacross the waters for more than a hundred miles, sounded to the\r\ninhabitants of Syracuse and Catania live the mutterings of distant\r\nthunder.[1351] In the midst of this turmoil, and encompassed by the\r\nglittering lines of the besiegers, the two Christian fortresses might be\r\ndimly discerned amidst volumes of fire and smoke, which, rolling darkly\r\nround their summits, almost hid from view the banner of St. John,\r\nproudly waving in the breeze, as in defiance of the enemy.\r\n\r\nBut the situation of the garrison, as the works crumbled under the\r\nstroke of the bullet, became every day more critical. La Valette\r\ncontrived to send information of it to the viceroy of Sicily, urging him\r\nto delay his coming no longer, if he would save the island. But, strange\r\nto say, such was the timid policy that had crept into the viceroy's\r\ncouncils, that it was seriously discussed whether it was expedient to\r\nsend aid at all to the Knights of Malta! Some insisted that there was no\r\nobligation on Spain to take any part in the quarrel, and that the\r\nknights should be left to fight out the battle with the Turks in Malta,\r\nas they had before done in Rhodes. Others remonstrated against this,\r\ndeclaring it would be an eternal blot on the scutcheon of Castile, if\r\nshe should desert in their need the brave chivalry who for so many years\r\nhad been fighting the battles of Christendom. The king of Spain, in\r\nparticular, as the feudatory sovereign of the order, was bound to\r\nprotect the island from the Turks, who, moreover, once in possession of\r\nit, would prove the most terrible scourge that ever fell on the commerce\r\nof the Mediterranean. The more generous, happily the more politic,\r\ncounsel prevailed; and the viceroy contrived to convey an assurance to\r\nthe grand-master, that, if he could hold out till the end of the\r\nfollowing month, he would come with sixteen thousand men to his\r\nrelief.[1352]\r\n\r\nBut this was a long period for men in extremity to wait. La Valette saw\r\nwith grief how much deceived he had been in thus leaning on the viceroy.\r\nHe determined to disappoint his brethren no longer by holding out\r\ndelusive promises of succor. \"The only succor to be relied on,\" he said,\r\n\"was that of Almighty God. He who has hitherto preserved his children\r\nfrom danger will not now abandon them.\"[1353] La Valette reminded his\r\nfollowers, that they were the soldiers of Heaven, fighting for the\r\nFaith, for liberty and life. \"Should the enemy prevail,\" he added, with\r\na politic suggestion, \"the Christians could expect no better fate than\r\nthat of their comrades in St. Elmo.\" The grand-master's admonition was\r\nnot lost upon the soldiers. \"Every man of us,\" says Balbi, \"resolved to\r\ndie rather than surrender, and to sell his life as dearly as possible.\r\nFrom that hour no man talked of succors.\"[1354]\r\n\r\nOne of those spiritual weapons from the papal armory, which have\r\nsometimes proved of singular efficacy in times of need, came now most\r\nseasonably to the aid of La Valette. A bull of Pius the Fourth granted\r\nplenary indulgence for all sins which had been committed by those\r\nengaged in this holy war against the Moslems. \"There were few,\" says the\r\nchronicler, \"either women or men, old enough to appreciate it, who did\r\nnot strive to merit this grace by most earnest devotion to the cause,\r\nand who did not have entire faith that all who died in the good work\r\nwould be at once received into glory.\"[1355]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GENERAL ASSAULT.]\r\n\r\nMore than two weeks had elapsed since the attempt, so disastrous to the\r\nTurks, on the fortress of St. Michael. During this time they had kept up\r\nan unintermitting fire on the Christian fortifications; and the effect\r\nwas visible in more than one fearful gap, which invited the assault of\r\nthe enemy. The second of August was accordingly fixed on as the day for\r\na general attack, to be made on both Port St. Michael, and on the\r\nbastion of Castile, which, situated at the head of the English Port,\r\neastward of Il Borgo, flanked the line of defence on that quarter.\r\nMustapha was to conduct in person the operations against the fort; the\r\nassault on the bastion he intrusted to Piali;--a division of the command\r\nby which the ambition of the rival chiefs would be roused to the utmost.\r\n\r\nFortunately, La Valette obtained notice, through some deserters, of the\r\nplans of the Turkish commanders, and made his preparations accordingly.\r\nOn the morning of the second, Piali's men, at the appointed signal,\r\nmoved briskly forward to the assault. They soon crossed the ditch, but\r\npartially filled with the ruins of the rampart, scaled the ascent in\r\nface of a sharp fire of musketry, and stood at length, with ranks\r\nsomewhat shattered, on the summit of the breach. But here they were\r\nopposed by retrenchments within, thrown up by the besieged, from behind\r\nwhich they now poured such heavy volleys among the assailants as\r\nstaggered the front of the column, and compelled it to fall back some\r\npaces in the rear. Here it was encountered by those pushing forward from\r\nbelow; and some confusion ensued. This was increased by the vigor with\r\nwhich the garrison now plied their musketry from the ramparts, hurling\r\ndown at the same time heavy logs, hand-grenades, and torrents of\r\nscalding pitch on the heads of the assailing column, which, blinded and\r\nstaggering under the shock, reeled to and fro like a drunken man. To add\r\nto their distress, the feet of the soldiers were torn and entangled\r\namong the spikes which had been thickly set in the ruins of the breach\r\nby the besieged. Woe to him who fell! His writhing body was soon\r\ntrampled under the press. In vain the Moslem chiefs endeavored to\r\nrestore order. Their voices were lost in the wild uproar that raged\r\naround. At this crisis the knights, charging at the head of their\r\nfollowers, cleared the breach, and drove the enemy with loss into his\r\ntrenches.\r\n\r\nThere the broken column soon re-formed, and, strengthened by fresh\r\ntroops, was again brought to the attack. But this gave a respite to the\r\ngarrison, which La Valette improved by causing refreshments to be served\r\nto the soldiers. By his provident care, skins containing wine and water,\r\nwith rations of bread, were placed near the points of attack, to be\r\ndistributed among the men.[1356] The garrison, thus strengthened, were\r\nenabled to meet the additional forces brought against them by the enemy;\r\nand the refreshments on the one side were made, in some sort, to\r\ncounterbalance the reinforcements on the other. Vessels filled with salt\r\nand water were also at hand, to bathe the wounds of such as were injured\r\nby the fireworks. \"Without these various precautions,\" says the\r\nchronicler, \"it would have been impossible for so few men as we were to\r\nkeep our ground against such a host as now assailed us on every\r\nquarter.\"[1357]\r\n\r\nAgain and again the discomfited Turks gathered strength for a new\r\nassault, and as often they were repulsed with the same loss as before;\r\ntill Piali drew off his dispirited legions, and abandoned all further\r\nattempts for that day.\r\n\r\nIt fared no better on the other quarter, where the besiegers, under the\r\neye of the commander-in-chief, were storming the fortress of St.\r\nMichael. On every point the stout-hearted chivalry of St. John were\r\nvictorious. But victory was bought at a heavy price.\r\n\r\nThe Turks returned to the attack on the day following, and on each\r\nsucceeding day. It was evidently their purpose to profit by their\r\nsuperior numbers to harass the besieged, and reduce them to a state of\r\nexhaustion. One of these assaults was near being attended with fatal\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nA mine which ran under the bastion of Castile was sprung, and brought\r\ndown a wide extent of the rampart. The enemy, prepared for the event,\r\nmounting the smoking ruins, poured through the undefended breach,--or\r\ndefended only by a handful of the garrison, who were taken unawares. The\r\nnext minute, the great standard of the Ottomans was planted on the\r\nwalls. The alarm was raised. In a few moments the enemy would have been\r\nin the heart of the town. An ecclesiastic of the order, Brother William\r\nby name, terrified at the sight, made all haste to the grand-master,\r\nthen at his usual station in the public square. Rushing into his\r\npresence, the priest called on him to take refuge, while he could, in\r\nthe castle of St. Angelo, as the enemy had broken into the town. But the\r\ndauntless chief, snatching up his pike, with no other protection than\r\nhis helmet, and calling out to those around him, \"Now is the time! let\r\nus die together!\"[1358] hurried to the scene of action, where, rallying\r\nhis followers, he fell furiously on the enemy. A sharp struggle ensued.\r\nMore than one knight was struck down by La Valette's side. He himself\r\nwas wounded in the leg by the splinter of a hand-grenade. The alarm-bell\r\nof the city rang violently. The cry was raised that the grand-master was\r\nin danger. Knights, soldiers, and townsmen came rushing to the spot.\r\nEven the sick sprang from their beds, and made such haste as they could\r\nto the rescue. The Moslems, pressed on all sides, and shaken by the\r\nresolute charge, fell back slowly on the breach.\r\n\r\nThe cavaliers would now fain have persuaded the grand-master, who was\r\nstill standing among a heap of the slain, to retire to some place of\r\nsafety, and leave the issue of the battle to his companions. But, fixing\r\nhis eye on the Ottoman standard, still floating above the walls, he\r\nmournfully shook his head, in token of his resolution to remain. The\r\ngarrison, spurred on by shame and indignation, again charged the\r\nMoslems, with greater fury than before. The colors, wrenched from the\r\nramparts, were torn to shreds in the struggle. The Christians prevailed;\r\nand the Turks, quailing before their invincible spirit, were compelled,\r\nafter a long and bloody contest, to abandon the works they had so nearly\r\nwon.\r\n\r\nStill the grand-master, far from retiring, took up his quarters for the\r\nnight in the neighborhood of the breach. He had no doubt that the enemy\r\nwould return under cover of the darkness, and renew the assault before\r\nthe garrison had time to throw up retrenchments. It was in vain his\r\ncompanions besought him to withdraw, to leave the fight to them, and not\r\nto risk a life so precious to the community. \"And how can an old man\r\nlike me,\" he said, \"end his life more gloriously, than when surrounded\r\nby his brethren and fighting the battles of the Cross?\"[1359]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE TURKS REPULSED.]\r\n\r\nLa Valette was right in his conjecture. No sooner had the darkness\r\nfallen, than the Turkish host, again under arms, came surging on across\r\nthe ruins of the rampart towards the breach. But it was not under cover\r\nof the darkness; for the whole bay was illumined by the incessant flash\r\nof artillery, by the blaze of combustibles, and the fiery track of the\r\nmissiles darting through the air. Thus the combat was carried on as by\r\nthe light of day. The garrison, prepared for the attack, renewed the\r\nscenes of the morning, and again beat off the assailants, who, broken\r\nand dispirited, could not be roused, even by the blows of their\r\nofficers, to return to the assault.[1360]\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, La Valette caused _Te Deum_ to be sung in the\r\nchurch of St. Lawrence, and thanks to be offered at the throne of grace\r\nfor their deliverance. And if the ceremonies were not conducted with the\r\naccustomed pomp of the order of St. John, they were at least\r\naccompanied, says the chronicler, who bore his part in them, by the\r\nsacrifice of contrite hearts,--as was shown by the tears of many a man,\r\nas well as woman, in the procession.[1361]\r\n\r\nThere was indeed almost as much cause for sorrow as for joy. However\r\nsuccessful the Christians had been in maintaining their defence, and\r\nhowever severe the loss they had inflicted on the enemy, they had to\r\nmourn the loss of some of their most illustrious knights, while others\r\nlay disabled in their beds. Among the latter was De Monti, admiral of\r\nthe order, now lying seriously ill of wounds received in the defence of\r\nSt. Michael, of which he was commander. Among the deaths was one which\r\ncame home to the bosom of La Valette. A young cavalier, his nephew, had\r\nengaged in a perilous enterprise with a comrade of his own age. The\r\nhandsome person and gilded armor of the younger La Valette made him a\r\nfatal mark for the enemy;[1362] and he fell, together with his friend,\r\nin the ditch before the bastion, under a shower of Turkish bullets. An\r\nobstinate struggle succeeded between Christians and Turks for the bodies\r\nof the slain. The Christians were victorious; and La Valette had the\r\nmelancholy satisfaction of rendering the last offices to the remains of\r\nhis gallant kinsman. The brethren would have condoled with him on his\r\nloss. But his generous nature shrank from the indulgence of a selfish\r\nsorrow. \"All are alike dear to me,\" he said; \"all of you I look on as my\r\nchildren. I mourn for Polastra\" (the friend of the young La Valette) \"as\r\nI do for my own nephew. And after all, it matters little. They have gone\r\nbefore us but for a short time.\"[1363]\r\n\r\nIt was indeed no season for the indulgence of private sorrows, when\r\nthose of a public nature pressed so heavily on the heart. Each day the\r\ncondition of the besieged was becoming more critical. The tottering\r\ndefences both of Il Borgo and La Sangle were wasting away under the\r\nremorseless batteries of the besiegers. Great numbers, not merely of the\r\nknights and the soldiers, but of the inhabitants, had been slain. The\r\nwomen of the place had shown, throughout the whole siege, the same\r\nheroic spirit as the men. They not only discharged the usual feminine\r\nduties of tending and relieving the sick, but they were often present in\r\nthe battle, supplying the garrison with refreshments, or carrying the\r\nammunition, or removing the wounded to the hospital. Thus sharing in the\r\ndanger of their husbands and fathers, they shared too in their fate.\r\nMany perished by the enemy's fire; and the dead bodies of women lay\r\nmingled among those of the men, on the ramparts and in the\r\nstreets.[1364] The hospitals were filled with the sick and wounded,\r\nthough fortunately no epidemic had as yet broken out to swell the bills\r\nof mortality. Those of the garrison who were still in a condition to do\r\ntheir duty were worn by long vigils and excessive toil. To fight by day,\r\nto raise intrenchments or to repair the crumbling works by night, was\r\nthe hard duty of the soldier. Brief was the respite allowed him for\r\nrepose,--a repose to be broken at any moment by the sound of the\r\nalarm-bell, and to be obtained only amidst so wild an uproar, that it\r\nseemed, in the homely language of the veteran so often quoted, \"as if\r\nthe world were coming to an end.\"[1365]\r\n\r\nHappily, through the provident care of the grand-master, there was still\r\na store of provisions in the magazines. But the ammunition was already\r\ngetting low. Yet the resolution of the besieged did not fail them. Their\r\nresolution had doubtless been strengthened by the cruel conduct of the\r\nTurks at St. Elmo, which had shown that from such a foe there was no\r\nmercy to be expected. The conviction of this had armed the Christians\r\nwith the courage of despair. On foreign succor they no longer relied.\r\nTheir only reliance was where their chief had taught them to place\r\nit,--on the protection of Heaven; and La Valette, we are assured, went\r\nevery day during the siege to the church of St. Lawrence, and there\r\nsolemnly invoked that protection for the brave men who, alone and\r\nunaided, were thus fighting the battles of the Faith.[1366]\r\n\r\nThe forlorn condition of the defences led, at length, the Council of\r\nGrand Crosses, after much deliberation, to recommend to La Valette to\r\nabandon Il Borgo, and to withdraw with the troops and the inhabitants\r\ninto the castle of St. Angelo. The grand-master saw at once the\r\ndisastrous consequences of such a step, and he rejected it without a\r\nmoment's hesitation. To withdraw into the castle, he said, would be to\r\ngive up all communication with St. Michael, and to abandon its brave\r\ngarrison to their fate. The inhabitants of the town would fare no\r\nbetter. The cistern which supplied St. Angelo with water would be wholly\r\ninadequate to the demands of such a multitude; and they would soon be\r\nreduced to extremity. \"No, my brethren,\" he concluded; \"here we must\r\nmake our stand; and here we must die, if we cannot maintain ourselves\r\nagainst the infidel.\"[1367]\r\n\r\nHe would not even consent to have the sacred relics, or the archives of\r\nthe order, removed thither, as to a place of greater security. It would\r\nserve to discourage the soldiers, by leading them to suppose that he\r\ndistrusted their power of maintaining the town against the enemy. On the\r\ncontrary, he caused a bridge communicating with the castle to be broken\r\ndown, after calling off the greater part of the garrison to assist in\r\nthe defence of Il Borgo. By these measures, he proclaimed his\r\nunalterable determination to maintain the town to the last, and if need\r\nwere, to die in its defence.[1368]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE TURKS DISPIRITED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSIEGE OF MALTA.\r\n\r\nThe Turks dispirited.--Reinforcement from Sicily.--Siege\r\nraised.--Mustapha defeated.--Rejoicings of the\r\nChristians.--Mortification of Solyman.--Review of the Siege.--Subsequent\r\nHistory of La Valette.\r\n\r\n1565.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the affairs of the besieged wore the gloomy aspect depicted in the\r\nlast chapter, those of the besiegers were not much better. More than\r\nhalf their original force had perished. To the bloody roll of those who\r\nhad fallen in the numerous assaults were now to be added the daily\r\nvictims of pestilence. In consequence of the great heat, exposure, and\r\nbad food, a dysentery had broken out in the Moslem army, and was now\r\nsweeping off its hundreds in a day. Both ammunition and provisions were\r\nrunning low. Ships bringing supplies were constantly intercepted by the\r\nSicilian cruisers. Many of the heavy guns were so much damaged by the\r\nfire of the besieged, as to require to be withdrawn and sent on board\r\nthe fleet,--an operation performed with a silence that contrasted\r\nstrongly with the noisy shouts with which the batteries had been\r\nraised.[1369] But these movements could not be conducted so silently as\r\nto escape the notice of the garrison, whose spirits were much revived by\r\nthe reports daily brought in by deserters of the condition of the enemy.\r\n\r\nMustapha chafed not a little under the long-protracted resistance of the\r\nbesieged. He looked with apprehension to the consequences of a failure\r\nin an expedition for which preparations had been made on so magnificent\r\na scale by his master, and with so confident hopes of success. He did\r\nnot fail to employ every expedient for effecting his object that the\r\nmilitary science of that day--at least Turkish science--could devise. He\r\nordered movable wooden towers to be built, such as were used under the\r\nancient system of besieging fortified places, from which, when brought\r\nnear to the works, his musketeers might send their volleys into the\r\ntown. But the besieged, sallying forth, set fire to his towers, and\r\nburnt them to the ground. He caused a huge engine to be made, of the\r\ncapacity of a hogshead; filled with combustibles, and then swung, by\r\nmeans of machinery, on the rampart of the bastion. But the garrison\r\nsucceeded in throwing it back on the heads of the inventors, where it\r\nexploded with terrible effect. Mustapha ran his mines under the\r\nChristian defences, until the ground was perforated like a honeycomb,\r\nand the garrison seemed to be treading on the crust of a volcano. La\r\nValette countermined in his turn. The Christians, breaking into the\r\ngalleries of the Turks, engaged them boldly underground; and sometimes\r\nthe mine, exploding, buried both Turk and Christian under a heap of\r\nruins.\r\n\r\nBaffled on every point, with their ranks hourly thinned by disease, the\r\nMoslem troops grew sullen and dispirited; and now that the bastion of\r\nCastile, with its dilapidated works, stood like some warrior stripped of\r\nhis armor, his defenceless condition inviting attack, they were in no\r\nheart to make it. As their fire slackened, and their assaults became\r\nfewer and more feeble, the confidence of the Christians was renewed;\r\nuntil they even cherished the hope of beating off the enemy without the\r\nlong-promised succors from Sicily. Fortunately for the honor of Spain,\r\nthe chivalry of St. John were not driven to this perilous attempt.\r\n\r\nYielding, at length, to the solicitations of the knights and the\r\nenthusiasm of the army, the viceroy, Don Garcia de Toledo, assembled his\r\nfleet in the port of Syracuse, and on the 25th of August weighed anchor.\r\nThe fleet consisted of twenty-eight galleys, and carried eleven thousand\r\ntroops, chiefly Spanish veterans, besides two hundred knights of the\r\norder, who had arrived from other lands, in time to witness the closing\r\nscene of the drama. There was also a good number of adventurers from\r\nSpain, France, and Italy, many of them persons of rank, and some of high\r\nmilitary renown, who had come to offer their services to the knights of\r\nMalta, and share in their glorious defence.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in its short passage, the fleet encountered a violent\r\ngale, which did so much damage, that the viceroy was compelled to return\r\nto Sicily, and repair his galleys. He then put to sea again, with better\r\nfortune. He succeeded in avoiding the notice of the enemy, part of whose\r\narmament lay off the mouth of the Great Port, to prevent the arrival of\r\nsuccors to the besieged,--and on the 6th of September, under cover of\r\nthe evening, entered the Bay of Melecca, on the western side of the\r\nisland.[1370]\r\n\r\nThe next morning, having landed his forces, with their baggage and\r\nmilitary stores, the viceroy sailed again for Sicily, to bring over an\r\nadditional reinforcement of four thousand troops, then waiting in\r\nMessina. He passed near enough to the beleaguered fortresses to be\r\ndescried by the garrisons, whom he saluted with three salvos of\r\nartillery, that sent joy into their hearts.[1371] It had a very\r\ndifferent effect on the besiegers. They listened with nervous credulity\r\nto the exaggerated reports that soon reached them, of the strength of\r\nthe reinforcement landed in the island, by which they expected to be\r\nspeedily assaulted in their trenches. Without delay, Mustapha made\r\npreparations for his departure. His heavy guns and camp equipage were\r\ngot on board the galleys and smaller vessels, lying off the entrance of\r\nthe Great Port,--and all as silently and expeditiously as possible. La\r\nValette had hoped that some part of the Spanish reinforcement would be\r\ndetached during the night to the aid of the garrison, when he proposed\r\nto sally on the enemy, and, if nothing better came of it, to get\r\npossession of their cannon, so much needed for his own fortifications.\r\nBut no such aid arrived; and, through the long night, he impatiently\r\nlistened to the creaking of the wheels that bore off the artillery to\r\nthe ships.[1372]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MUSTAPHA DEFEATED.]\r\n\r\nWith the first light of morning the whole Ottoman force was embarked on\r\nboard the vessels, which, weighing anchor, moved round to Port Musiette,\r\non the other side of St. Elmo, where the Turkish fleet, the greater part\r\nof which lay there, was now busily preparing for its departure. No\r\nsooner had the enemy withdrawn, than the besieged poured out into the\r\ndeserted trenches. One or two of those huge pieces of ordnance, which,\r\nfrom their unwieldy size, it was found impossible to remove, had been\r\nabandoned by the Turks, and remained a memorable trophy of the\r\nsiege.[1373] The Christians were not long in levelling the Moslem\r\nentrenchments; and very soon the flag of St. John was seen cheerily\r\nwaving in the breeze, above the ruins of St. Elmo. The grand-master now\r\ncalled his brethren together to offer up their devotions in the same\r\nchurch of St. Lawrence where he had so often invoked the protection of\r\nHeaven during the siege. \"Never did music sound sweeter to human ears,\"\r\nexclaims Balbi, \"than when those bells summoned us to mass, at the same\r\nhour at which, for three months past, they had sounded the alarm against\r\nthe enemy.\"[1374] A procession was formed of all the members of the\r\norder, the soldiers, and the citizens. The services were performed with\r\ngreater solemnity, as well as pomp, than could be observed in the hurry\r\nand tumult of the siege; and, with overflowing hearts, the multitude\r\njoined in the _Te Deum_, and offered up thanks to the Almighty and the\r\nBlessed Virgin for their deliverance from their enemies.[1375] It was\r\nthe eighth of September, the day of the Nativity of the Virgin,--a\r\nmemorable day in the annals of Malta, and still observed by the\r\ninhabitants as their most glorious anniversary.\r\n\r\nHardly had the Turkish galleys, with Mustapha on board, joined the great\r\nbody of the fleet in Port Musiette, than that commander received such\r\nintelligence as convinced him that the report of the Spanish numbers had\r\nbeen greatly exaggerated. He felt that he had acted precipitately, thus,\r\nwithout a blow, to abandon the field to an enemy his inferior in\r\nstrength. His head may well have trembled on his shoulders, as he\r\nthought of returning thus dishonored to the presence of his indignant\r\nmaster. Piali, it is said, was not displeased at the mortification of\r\nhis rival. The want of concert between them had, in more than one\r\ninstance, interfered with the success of their operations. It was now,\r\nhowever, agreed that Mustapha should disembark, with such of the troops\r\nas were in fighting order, and give battle to the Spaniards. Piali,\r\nmeanwhile, would quit the port, which lay exposed to St. Elmo,--now in\r\nhis enemy's hands,--and anchor farther west, in the roads of St. Paul.\r\n\r\nThe troops from Sicily, during this time, had advanced into the\r\ninterior, in the neighborhood of _Citta Notable_,--or, as it is now\r\ncalled, _Citta Vecchia_. They were commanded by Ascanio de la Corña, an\r\nofficer who had gained a name in the Italian wars. Alvaro de Sandé was\r\nsecond in command, the same captain who made so heroic a defence in the\r\nisle of Gelves against the Turks. The chivalrous daring of the latter\r\nofficer was well controlled by the circumspection of the former.\r\n\r\nLa Valette, who kept a vigilant eye on the movements of the Turks, was\r\ncareful to advise Don Ascanio that they had again disembarked, and were\r\non their march against him. The Spanish general took up a strong\r\nposition on an eminence, the approach, to which was rugged and\r\ndifficult in the extreme. Thus secured, the prudent chief proposed to\r\nawait the assault of the Moslems. But the Knights of St. John, who had\r\naccompanied the Sicilian succors, eager for vengeance on the hated\r\nenemies of their order, called loudly to be led against the infidel. In\r\nthis they were joined by the fiery De Sandé and the greater part of the\r\ntroops. When the Moslem banners, therefore, came in sight, and the dense\r\ncolumns of the enemy were seen advancing across the country, the\r\nimpatience of the Christians was not to be restrained. The voices of the\r\nofficers were unheeded. Don Ascanio saw it was not wise to balk this\r\ntemper of the troops. They were hastily formed in order of battle, and\r\nthen, like a mountain torrent, descended swiftly against the foe.\r\n\r\nOn their left was a hill, crowned by a small tower that commanded the\r\nplain. The Turks had succeeded in getting possession of this work. A\r\ndetachment of Spaniards scaled the eminence, attacked the Turks, and,\r\nafter a short struggle, carried the fort. Meanwhile the Maltese\r\nchivalry, with Sandé and the great body of the army, fell with fury on\r\nthe front and flanks of the enemy. The Turkish soldiers, disgusted by\r\nthe long and disastrous siege, had embarked with great alacrity; and\r\nthey had not repressed their murmurs of discontent, when they were again\r\nmade to land and renew the conflict. Sullen and disheartened, they were\r\nin no condition to receive the shock of the Spaniards. Many were borne\r\ndown by it at once, their ranks were broken, and their whole body; was\r\nthrown into disarray. Some few endeavored to make head against their\r\nassailants. Most thought only of securing safety by-flight. The knights\r\nfollowed close on the fugitives. Now was the hour of vengeance. No\r\nquarter was given. Their swords were reddened with the blood of the\r\ninfidel.[1376]\r\n\r\nMustapha, careless of his own life, made the most intrepid efforts to\r\nsave his men. He was ever in the hottest of the action. Twice he was\r\nunhorsed, and had nearly fallen into the hands of his enemies. At\r\nlength, rallying a body of musketeers, he threw himself into the rear,\r\nto cover the retreat of the army. Facing about, he sent such a\r\nwell-directed volley among his pursuers, who were coming on in disorder,\r\nthat they were compelled to halt. Don Alvaro's horse was slain under\r\nhim. Several knights were wounded or brought to the ground. But as those\r\nin the rear came up, Mustapha was obliged to give way, and was soon\r\nswept along with the tide of battle in the direction of the port of St.\r\nPaul, where the fleet was at anchor. Boats were in readiness to receive\r\nthe troops; and a line of shallops, filled with arquebusiers, was drawn\r\nup alongside of them, to cover the embarkation. But the Spaniards,\r\nhurried forward by the heat of the pursuit, waded up to their girdles\r\ninto the sea, and maintained an incessant fire on the fugitives, many of\r\nwhom fell under it, while others, vainly endeavoring to swim to the\r\nships, perished in the waves; and their bodies, tossed upon the sands,\r\ncontinued for many a day to poison the atmosphere.[1377]--This was the\r\nlast effort of Mustapha; and the Turkish admiral, gathering together the\r\nwreck of his forces, again weighed anchor, and spreading his sails to\r\nthe breeze, steered his course for the Levant.[1378]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: REJOICINGS OF THE CHRISTIANS.]\r\n\r\nThe principal officers of the Spanish array, together with the knights,\r\nthen crossed over to Il Borgo.[1379] They met there with a cordial\r\nwelcome; but the knights, as they embraced their comrades, were greatly\r\nshocked by their appearance,--their wan and care-worn countenances,\r\ntheir emaciated figures, their long and matted hair, and their squalid\r\nattire. Many were disfigured by honorable scars; some were miserably\r\nmaimed; others wore bandages over wounds not yet healed. It was a\r\npiteous sight, too plainly intimating the extremity of suffering to\r\nwhich they had been reduced; and as the knights gazed on their brethren,\r\nand called to mind the friends they had lost, their hearts were filled\r\nwith unspeakable anguish.[1380]\r\n\r\nOn the fourteenth of September, the viceroy reappeared with the fleet,\r\nbearing the remainder of the reinforcement from Sicily. The admiral's\r\npennant displayed a cross, intimating that it was a holy war in which\r\nthey were engaged.[1381] As the squadron came proudly up the Great Port,\r\nwith pennons and streamers gayly flying from its masts, it was welcomed\r\nby salvos of artillery from the fortresses and bastions around; and the\r\nrocky shores, which had so long reverberated only with the din of war,\r\nnow echoed to the sounds of jubilee.\r\n\r\nThe grand-master came down to the landing-place below St. Angelo, to\r\nreceive the viceroy, with the nobles and cavaliers who followed in his\r\ntrain. They had come too late to share the dangers of the besieged, but\r\nnot too late to partake of their triumph. They were courteously\r\nconducted by La Valette, across the scene of desolation, to his own\r\npalace, which, though in an exposed quarter of the town, had so far\r\nescaped as to be still habitable. As the strangers gazed on the remains\r\nof the fortifications, nearly levelled to the ground, they marvelled\r\nthat the shadowy forms which they saw gliding among the ruins could have\r\nso long held out against the Moslem armies. Well had they earned for\r\ntheir city the title of _Vittoriosa_, \"The Victorious,\" which,\r\nsupplanting that of Il Borgo, still commemorates its defence against the\r\ninfidel.\r\n\r\nLa Valette had provided an entertainment for his illustrious guests, as\r\ngood as his limited resources would allow; but it is said that the\r\nbanquet was reinforced by a contribution from the viceroy's own\r\nstores.[1382] On the departure of the Spaniards, he showed his\r\ngratitude, while he indulged his munificent spirit, by bestowing\r\nhandsome presents on the captains and a liberal largess of money on the\r\nsoldiers.[1383]\r\n\r\nOn his way, the viceroy had discovered the Ottoman fleet formed in\r\ncompact order, and standing under press of sail towards the east. He was\r\ntoo far inferior in strength to care to intercept its course;[1384] and\r\nthe squadron reached in safety the port of Constantinople. Solyman had\r\nalready received despatches preparing him for the return of the fleet,\r\nand the failure of the expedition. It threw him into one of those\r\nparoxysms of ungovernable passion to which the old sultan seems to have\r\nbeen somewhat addicted in the latter years of his life. With impotent\r\nfury, he stamped on the letters, it is said, and, protesting that there\r\nwere none of his officers whom he could trust, he swore to lead an\r\nexpedition against Malta the coming year, and put every man in the\r\nisland to the sword.[1385] He had the magnanimity, however, not to wreak\r\nhis vengeance on the unfortunate commanders. The less to attract public\r\nnotice, he caused the fleet bearing the shattered remains of the army to\r\ncome into port in the night-time; thus affording a contrast sufficiently\r\nstriking to the spectacle presented by the brilliant armament which a\r\nfew months before had sailed from the Golden Horn amidst the joyous\r\nacclamations of the multitude.\r\n\r\nThe arms of Solyman the Second, during his long and glorious reign, met\r\nwith no reverse so humiliating as his failure in the siege of Malta. To\r\nsay nothing of the cost of the maritime preparations, the waste of life\r\nwas prodigious, amounting to more than thirty thousand men, Moors\r\nincluded, and comprehending the very best troops in the empire. This was\r\na loss of nearly three fourths of the original force of the besieging\r\narmy,--an almost incredible amount, showing that pestilence had been as\r\nactively at work as the sword of the enemy.[1386]\r\n\r\nYet the loss in this siege fell most grievously on the Christians. Full\r\ntwo hundred knights, twenty-five hundred soldiers, and more than seven\r\nthousand inhabitants,--men, women, and children, are said to have\r\nperished.[1387] The defences of the island were razed to the ground. The\r\ntowns were in ruins; the villages burnt; the green harvests cut down\r\nbefore they had time to ripen. The fiery track of war was over every\r\npart of Malta. Well might the simple inhabitants rue the hour when the\r\nKnights of St. John first set foot upon their shores. The military\r\nstores were exhausted, the granaries empty; the treasury was at the\r\nlowest ebb. The members of the order had now to begin the work of\r\nconstructing their fortunes over again. But still they enjoyed the glory\r\nof victory. They had the proud consciousness of having baffled, with\r\ntheir own good swords, the whole strength of the Ottoman empire. The\r\nsame invincible spirit still glowed in their bosoms, and they looked\r\nforward with unshaken confidence to the future.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: REVIEW OF THE SIEGE.]\r\n\r\nSuch were the results of this memorable siege,--one of the most\r\nmemorable sieges, considering the scale of the preparations, the amount\r\nof the forces, and the spirit of the defence, which are recorded on the\r\npages of history. It would not be easy, even for a military man, after\r\nthe lapse of three centuries, to criticize with any degree of confidence\r\nthe course pursued by the combatants, so as to determine to what causes\r\nmay be referred the failure of the besiegers. One obvious fault, and of\r\nthe greatest moment, was that already noticed, of not immediately\r\ncutting off the communications with St. Elmo, by which supplies were\r\nconstantly thrown into that fortress from the opposite side of the\r\nharbor. Another, similar in its nature, was, that, with so powerful a\r\nnavy as the Turks had at their command, they should have allowed\r\ncommunications to be maintained by the besieged with Sicily, and\r\nreinforcements thus introduced into the island. We find Mustapha and\r\nPiali throwing the blame of this mutually on each other, especially in\r\nthe case of Cardona, whose most seasonable succors might easily have\r\nbeen intercepted, either by land or sea, with proper vigilance on the\r\npart of the Turkish commanders. A serious impediment in the way of the\r\nbesiegers was the impossibility of forcing a subsistence for the troops\r\nfrom a barren spot like Malta, and the extreme difficulty of obtaining\r\nsupplies from other quarters, when so easily intercepted by the enemy's\r\ncruisers. Yet the Turkish galleys lying idle in the western port might\r\nhave furnished a ready convoy, one might suppose, for transports\r\nbringing provisions from the Barbary coast. But we find no such thing\r\nattempted. To all these causes of failure must be added the epidemic,\r\nwhich, generated under the tropical heats of a Maltese summer, spread\r\nlike a murrain through the camp of the besiegers, sweeping them off by\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\nIt operated well for the besieged, that the great advance made in the\r\nscience of fortification was such, in the latter half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, as in a great degree to counterbalance the advantages secured\r\nto the besiegers by the use of artillery,--especially such clumsy\r\nartillery, and so awkwardly served, as that of the Turks. But these\r\nadvantages would have proved of little worth, had it not been for the\r\ncharacter of the men who were to profit by them. It was the character of\r\nthe defenders that constituted the real strength of the defence. This\r\nwas the true bulwark that resisted every effort of the Ottoman arms,\r\nwhen all outward defences were swept away. Every knight was animated by\r\na sentiment of devotion to his order, and that hatred to the infidel in\r\nwhich he had been nursed from his cradle, and which had become a part of\r\nhis existence. These sentiments he had happily succeeded in\r\ncommunicating to his followers, and even to the people of the island.\r\nThus impelled by an unswerving principle of conduct, the whole body\r\nexhibited that unity and promptness of action which belongs to an\r\nindividual. From the first hour of the siege to the last, all idea of\r\nlistening to terms from the enemy was rejected. Every man was prepared\r\nto die rather than surrender. One exception only occurred,--that of a\r\nprivate soldier in La Sangle, who, denying the possibility of holding\r\nout against the Turks, insisted on the necessity of accepting the terms\r\noffered to the garrison. The example of his cowardice might have proved\r\ncontagious; and the wretched man expiated his offence on the\r\ngallows.[1388]\r\n\r\nAbove all, the strength of the besieged lay in the character of their\r\nchief. La Valette was one of those rare men whom Providence seems to\r\nraise up for special occasions, so wonderfully are their peculiar\r\nqualities suited to the emergency. To that attachment to his order which\r\nhe had in common with his brethren, he united a strong religious\r\nsentiment, sincere and self-sacrificing, which shone through every act\r\nof his life. This gave him an absolute ascendancy over his followers,\r\nwhich he had the capacity to turn to full account. He possessed many of\r\nthe requisites for success in action; great experience, a quick eye, a\r\ncool judgment. To these was united a fixedness of purpose not to be\r\nshaken by menace or entreaty; and which was only to be redeemed from the\r\nimputation of obstinacy by the extraordinary character of the\r\ncircumstances in which he was placed. The reader will recall a memorable\r\nexample, when La Valette insisted on defending St. Elmo to the last, in\r\ndefiance not only of the remonstrance, but the resistance, of its\r\ngarrison. Another equally pertinent is his refusal, though in opposition\r\nto his council, to abandon the town and retire to St. Angelo. One can\r\nhardly doubt that on his decision, in both these cases, rested the fate\r\nof Malta.\r\n\r\nLa Valette was of a serious turn, and, as it would seem, with a tendency\r\nto sadness in his temperament. In the portraits that remain of him, his\r\nnoble features are touched with a shade of melancholy, which, taken in\r\nconnection with his history, greatly heightens the interest of their\r\nexpression. His was not the buoyant temper, the flow of animal spirits,\r\nwhich carries a man over every obstacle in his way. Yet he could comfort\r\nthe sick, and cheer the desponding; not by making light of danger, but\r\nby encouraging them like brave men fearlessly to face it. He did not\r\ndelude his followers by the promises--after he had himself found them to\r\nbe delusive--of foreign succor. He taught them, instead, to rely on the\r\nsuccor of the Almighty, who would never desert those who were fighting\r\nin his cause. He infused into them the spirit of martyrs,--that brave\r\nspirit which, arming the soul with contempt of death, makes the weak man\r\nstronger than the strongest.\r\n\r\nThere is one mysterious circumstance in the history of this siege which\r\nhas never been satisfactorily explained,--the conduct of the viceroy of\r\nSicily. Most writers account for it by supposing that he only acted in\r\nobedience to the secret instructions of his master, unwilling to hazard\r\nthe safety of his fleet by interfering in behalf of the knights, unless\r\nsuch interference became absolutely necessary. But even on such a\r\nsupposition the viceroy does not stand excused; for it was little less\r\nthan a miracle that the knights were not exterminated before he came to\r\ntheir relief; and we can hardly suppose that an astute, far-sighted\r\nprince, like Philip, who had been so eager to make conquests from the\r\nMoslems in Africa, would have consented that the stronghold of the\r\nMediterranean should pass into the hands of the Turks. It seems more\r\nprobable that Don Garcia, aware of the greater strength of the Turkish\r\narmament, and oppressed by the responsibility of his situation as\r\nviceroy of Sicily, should have shrunk from the danger to which that\r\nisland would be exposed by the destruction of his fleet. On any view of\r\nthe case, it is difficult to explain a course so irreconcilable with the\r\nplan of operations concerted with the grand-master, and the promises of\r\nsupport given to him by Don Garcia at the beginning of the siege.\r\n\r\nLa Valette, we are told, subsequently complained of the viceroy's\r\nconduct to Pius the Fifth; and that pontiff represented the affair to\r\nthe king of Spain. Don Garcia had, soon after, the royal permission to\r\nretire from the government of Sicily. He withdrew to the kingdom of\r\nNaples, where he passed the remainder of his days, without public\r\nemployment of any kind, and died in obscurity.[1389]--Such a fate may\r\nnot be thought, after all, conclusive evidence that he had not acted in\r\nobedience to the private instructions of his sovereign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUBSEQUENT HISTORY OF LA VALETTE.]\r\n\r\nThe reader, who has followed La Valette through the siege of Malta, may\r\nperhaps feel some curiosity to learn the fate of this remarkable\r\nman.--The discomfiture of the Turks caused a great sensation throughout\r\nEurope. In Rome the tidings were announced by the discharge of cannon,\r\nilluminations, and bonfires. The places of public business were closed.\r\nThe shops were shut. The only places opened were the churches; and\r\nthither persons of every rank--the pope, the cardinals, and the\r\npeople--thronged in procession, and joined in public thanksgiving for\r\nthe auspicious event. The rejoicing was great all along the shores of\r\nthe Mediterranean, where the inhabitants had so severely suffered from\r\nthe ravages of the Turks. The name of La Valette was on every tongue, as\r\nthat of the true champion of the cross. Crowned heads vied with one\r\nanother in the honors and compliments which they paid him. The king of\r\nSpain sent him a present of a sword and poniard, the handles of which\r\nwere of gold superbly mounted with diamonds. The envoy, who delivered\r\nthese in presence of the assembled knights, accompanied the gift with a\r\npompous eulogy on La Valette himself, whom he pronounced the greatest\r\ncaptain of the age, beseeching him to continue to employ his sword in\r\ndefence of Christendom. Pius the Fifth sent him--what, considering the\r\ngrand-master's position, may be thought a singular compliment--a\r\ncardinal's hat. La Valette, however, declined it, on the ground that his\r\nduties as a cardinal would interfere with those which devolved on him as\r\nhead of the order. Some referred his refusal to modesty; others, with\r\nprobably quite as much reason, to his unwillingness to compromise his\r\npresent dignity by accepting a subordinate station.[1390]\r\n\r\nBut La Valette had no time to dally with idle compliments and honors.\r\nHis little domain lay in ruins around him; and his chief thought now was\r\nhow to restore its fortunes. The first year after the siege, the knights\r\nhad good reason to fear a new invasion of the Moslems; and Philip\r\nquartered a garrison of near fifteen thousand troops in the island for\r\nits protection.[1391] But Solyman fortunately turned his arms against a\r\nnearer enemy, and died in the course of the same year, while carrying on\r\nthe war against Hungary.[1392] Selim, his successor, found another\r\ndirection for his ambition. Thus relieved of his enemies, the\r\ngrand-master was enabled to devote all his energies to the great work of\r\nrebuilding his fallen capital, and placing the island in a more perfect\r\nstate of defence than it had ever been. He determined on transferring\r\nthe residence of the order to the high land of Mount Sceberras, which\r\ndivides the two harbors, and which would give him the command of both.\r\nHis quick eye readily discerned those advantages of the position, which\r\ntime has since fully proved. Here he resolved to build his capital, to\r\nsurround it with fortifications, and, at the same time, to enlarge and\r\nstrengthen those of St. Elmo.\r\n\r\nBut his treasury was low. He prepared a plan of his improvements, which\r\nhe sent to the different European princes, requesting their coöperation,\r\nand urging the importance to them all of maintaining Malta as the best\r\nbulwark against the infidel. His plan met with general approbation. Most\r\nof the sovereigns responded to his appeal by liberal contributions,--and\r\namong them the French king; notwithstanding his friendly relations with\r\nthe sultan. To these funds the members of the order freely added\r\nwhatever each could raise by his own credit. This amount was still\r\nfurther swelled by the proceeds of prizes brought into port by the\r\nMaltese cruisers,--an inexhaustible source of revenue.\r\n\r\nFunds being thus provided, the work went forward apace. On the\r\ntwenty-eighth of March, 1566, the grand-master, clad in his robes of\r\nceremony, and in the presence of a vast concourse of knights and\r\ninhabitants, laid the first stone of the new capital. It was carved with\r\nhis own arms; and a Latin inscription recorded the name of \"Valetta,\"\r\nwhich the city was to bear in honor of its founder.[1393] More than\r\neight thousand men were employed on the work; and a bull of Pius the\r\nFifth enjoined that their labors should not be suspended on\r\nfête-days.[1394] It seemed to be regarded as a Christian duty to provide\r\nfor the restoration of Malta.[1395] La Valette superintended the\r\noperations in person. He was ever to be seen on the spot, among the\r\nworkmen. There he took his meals, discussed affairs of state with his\r\ncouncil, and even gave audience to envoys from abroad.[1396]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these quiet occupations, there were some occurrences\r\nwhich distracted the attention, and greatly disturbed the tranquillity,\r\nof La Valette. One of these was the disorderly conduct of some of the\r\nyounger knights. Another was a dispute in which he was involved with the\r\npope, who, in the usual encroaching spirit of the Vatican, had\r\nappropriated to himself the nomination to certain benefices belonging to\r\nthe order.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUBSEQUENT HISTORY OF LA VALETTE.]\r\n\r\nThese unpleasant affairs weighed heavily on the grand-master's mind; and\r\nhe often sought to relieve his spirits by the diversion of hawking, of\r\nwhich he was extremely fond. While engaged in this sport, on a hot day\r\nin July, he received a stroke of the sun. He was immediately taken to Il\r\nBorgo. A fever set in; and it soon became apparent that his frame,\r\nenfeebled by his unparalleled fatigues and hardships, was rapidly\r\nsinking under it. Before dying, he called around his bed some of the\r\nbrethren to whom the management of affairs was chiefly committed, and\r\ngave them his counsel in respect to the best method of carrying out his\r\nplans. He especially enjoined on them to maintain a spirit of unity\r\namong themselves, if they would restore the order to its ancient\r\nprosperity and grandeur. By his testament, he liberated his slaves, some\r\nfifty in number; and he obtained the consent of his brethren to bequeath\r\na sum sufficient to endow a chapel he had built in Valetta, to\r\ncommemorate his victory over the infidels. It was dedicated to the\r\nBlessed Virgin; and in this chapel he desired that his body might be\r\nlaid. Having completed these arrangements, he expired on the\r\ntwenty-first of August, 1568.\r\n\r\nLa Valette's dying commands were punctually executed by his brethren.\r\nThe coffin inclosing his remains was placed on board of the admiral's\r\ngalley, which, with four others that escorted it, was shrouded in black.\r\nThey bore the household of the deceased, and the members of the order.\r\nThe banners taken by him in battle with the Moslems were suspended from\r\nthe sterns of the vessels, and trailed through the water. The\r\nprocession, on landing, took its way through the streets of the embryo\r\ncapital, where the sounds of labor were now hushed, to the chapel of Our\r\nLady of Victory. The funeral obsequies were there performed with all\r\nsolemnity; and the remains of the hero were consigned to the tomb,\r\namidst the tears of the multitude, who had gathered from all parts of\r\nthe island, to pay this sad tribute of respect to his memory.[1397]\r\n\r\nThe traveller who visits Malta at the present day finds no object more\r\ninteresting than the stately cathedral of Valetta, still rich in\r\nhistorical memorials and in monuments of art, of which even French\r\nrapacity could not despoil it. As he descends into its crypts, and\r\nwanders through its subterranean recesses, he sees the niche where still\r\nrepose the remains of La Valette, surrounded by the brave chivalry who\r\nfought, side by side with him, the battles of the Faith. And surely no\r\nmore fitting place could be found for his repose, than the heart of the\r\nnoble capital which may be said to have been created by his\r\ngenius.[1398]\r\n\r\nThe Knights of St. John continued, in the main, faithful to the maxims\r\nof La Valette and to the principles of their institution. For more than\r\ntwo centuries after his death, their sword was ever raised against the\r\ninfidel. Their galleys still returned to port freighted with the spoils\r\nof the barbarian. They steadily continued to advance in power and\r\nopulence; and while empires rose and crumbled around them, this little\r\nbrotherhood of warlike monks, after a lapse of more than seven centuries\r\nfrom its foundation, still maintained a separate and independent\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nIn the long perspective of their annals, there was no event which they\r\ncontinued to hold in so much honor as the defence of Malta by La\r\nValette. The eighth of September--the day of the nativity of the\r\nVirgin--continued to the last to be celebrated as their proudest\r\nanniversary. On that day the whole body of the knights, and the people\r\nof the capital, walked in solemn procession, with the grand-master at\r\ntheir head, to the church of St. John. A knight, wearing the helmet and\r\nmailed armor of the ancient time, bore on high the victorious standard\r\nof the order. A page by his side carried the superb sword and poniard\r\npresented by Philip the Second. As the procession passed into the\r\nchurch, and the standard was laid at the foot of the altar, it was\r\nannounced by flourishes of trumpets and by peals of artillery from the\r\nfortresses. The services were performed by the prior of St. John's; and,\r\nwhile the Gospel was read, the grand-master held the naked sword aloft,\r\nin token that the knights were ever ready to do battle for the\r\nCross.[1399] When the ceremony was concluded, a fine portrait of La\r\nValette was exhibited to the people; and the brethren gazed, with\r\nfeelings of reverence, on his majestic lineaments, as on those of the\r\nsaviour of their order.[1400]\r\n\r\nBut all this is changed. The Christians, instead of being banded against\r\nthe Turk, now rally in his defence. There are no longer crusades against\r\nthe infidel. The age of chivalry has passed. The objects for which the\r\nKnights Hospitallers were instituted have long since ceased to exist;\r\nand it was fitting that the institution, no longer needed, should die\r\nwith them. The knights who survived the ruin of their order became\r\nwanderers in foreign lands. Their island has passed into the hands of\r\nthe stranger; and the flag of England now waves from the ramparts on\r\nwhich once floated the banner of St. John.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nDON CARLOS.\r\n\r\nHis Education and Character.--Dangerous Illness.--Extravagant\r\nBehavior.--Opinions respecting him.--His Connection with the\r\nFlemings.--Project of Flight.--Insane Conduct.--Arrest.\r\n\r\n1567, 1568.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must now, after a long absence, return to the shores of Spain, where\r\nevents were taking place of the highest importance to the future\r\nfortunes of the monarchy. At the time when the tragic incidents\r\ndescribed in the preceding Book were passing in the Netherlands, others,\r\nnot less tragic, if we may trust to popular rumor, were occurring in the\r\nvery palace of the monarch. I allude to the death of Don Carlos, prince\r\nof Asturias, and that of Isabella of Valois, Philip's young and\r\nbeautiful queen. The relations in which the two parties stood to each\r\nother, their untimely fate, and the mystery in which it was enveloped,\r\nhave conspired with the sombre, unscrupulous character of Philip to\r\nsuggest the most horrible suspicions of the cause of their death. The\r\nmystery which hung over them in their own time has not been dissipated\r\nby the researches of later chroniclers. For that very reason, it has\r\nproved an inexhaustible theme for fiction, until it might be thought to\r\nhave passed from the domain of history into that of romance. It has been\r\nfound especially suited to the purposes of the drama; and the dramatic\r\nliterature of Europe contains more than one masterpiece from the hand of\r\ngenius, which displays in sombre coloring the loves and the misfortunes\r\nof Carlos and Isabella.[1401]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS EDUCATION AND CHARACTER.]\r\n\r\nThe time for discussing so dark and intricate a subject had not arrived\r\nwhile the Spanish archives were jealously locked up even from native\r\nscholars. But now that happily a more liberal system has prevailed, and\r\naccess has been given to the dread repositories of the secrets of the\r\nSpanish sovereigns, the time seems to have come for investigating this\r\nmysterious story. And if I cannot boast that I have been able to dispel\r\nthe doubts that have so long gathered around the subject, I may at least\r\nflatter myself that, with the materials at my command, I have the means\r\nof placing the reader in a better point of view than has yet been\r\nenjoyed, for surveying the whole ground, and forming his own\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nDon Carlos was born on the eighth of July, 1545. His mother, Mary of\r\nPortugal, then only eighteen years of age, died a few days after giving\r\nbirth to her ill-fated child. Thus deprived from the cradle of a\r\nmother's watchful care, he experienced almost as little of his father's;\r\nfor, until Carlos was fourteen years old, Philip was absent most of the\r\ntime, either in the Low Countries or in England. The care of the child\r\nwas intrusted, during the greater part of this period, to Philip's\r\nsister, the Regent Joanna,--an excellent woman, but who, induced\r\nprobably by the feeble constitution of Carlos, is said to have shown too\r\nmuch indulgence to the boy, being more solicitous to secure his bodily\r\nhealth than to form his character. In our easy faith in the miracles\r\nclaimed for education, it sometimes happens that we charge on the\r\nparent, or the preceptor, the defects that may be more reasonably\r\nreferred to the vicious constitution of the child.\r\n\r\nAs Carlos grew older, Philip committed the care of his instruction to\r\nHonorato Juan, a member of the emperor's household. He was a\r\nwell-trained scholar, and a man of piety as well as learning; and soon\r\nafter assuming the task of the prince's preceptor, he embraced the\r\nreligious profession. The correspondence of Honorato Juan with Philip,\r\nthen in Flanders, affords a view of the proficiency of Carlos when\r\neleven or twelve years old. The contentment which the king evinces in\r\nthe earlier letters diminishes as we advance; and anxious doubts are\r\nexpressed, as he gathers the unwelcome information from his tutor of his\r\npupil's indifference to his studies.[1402]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1556, Charles the Fifth stopped some time at Valladolid, on\r\nhis way to his cloistered retreat at Yuste. He there saw his grandson,\r\nand took careful note of the boy, the heir to the vast dominions which\r\nhe had himself so recently relinquished. He told over his campaigns to\r\nCarlos, and how he had fled at Innsbruck, where he barely escaped\r\nfalling into the hands of the enemy. Carlos, who listened eagerly,\r\ninterrupted his grandfather, exclaiming, \"I never would have fled!\"\r\nCharles endeavored to explain the necessity of the case; but the boy\r\nsturdily maintained, that he never would have fled,--amusing and indeed\r\ndelighting the emperor, who saw in this the mettle of his own earlier\r\ndays.[1403] Yet Charles was not blind to the defects of his\r\ngrandson,--to the wayward, overbearing temper, which inferred too much\r\nindulgence on the part of his daughter the regent. He reprehended Carlos\r\nfor his want of deference to his aunt; and he plainly told the latter,\r\nthat, if she would administer more wholesome correction to the boy, the\r\nnation would have reason to thank her for it.[1404]\r\n\r\nAfter the emperor had withdrawn to his retreat, his mind, which kept its\r\nhold, as we have seen, on all matters of public interest beyond the\r\nwalls of the monastery, still reverted to his grandson, the heir of his\r\nname and of his sceptre. At Simancas the correspondence is still\r\npreserved which he carried on with Don Garcia de Toledo, a brother of\r\nthe duke of Alva, who held the post of _ayo_, or governor of the prince.\r\nIn one of that functionary's letters, written in 1557, when Carlos was\r\ntwelve years old, we have a brief chronicle of the distribution of the\r\nprince's time, somewhat curious, as showing the outlines of a royal\r\neducation in that day.\r\n\r\nBefore seven in the morning Carlos rose, and by half-past eight had\r\nbreakfasted, and attended mass. He then went to his studies, where he\r\ncontinued till the hour of dinner. What his studies were we are not\r\ntold. One writer of the time says, among other things, he read Cicero's\r\nOffices, in order the better to learn to control his passions.[1405] At\r\neleven he dined. He then amused himself with his companions, by playing\r\nat quoits, or at _trucos_, a kind of billiards, or in fencing, and\r\noccasionally riding. At half-past three came a light repast, the\r\n_merienda_; after which he listened to reading, or, if the weather was\r\nfine, strolled in the fields. In the evening he supped; and at half-past\r\nnine, having gone through the prayers of his rosary, he went to bed,\r\nwhere, as his _ayo_ says, he usually made but one nap of it till the\r\nmorning.--It was certainly a primitive way of life, in which more regard\r\nseems to have been had to the cravings of the body than of the mind, and\r\nas regular in its routine as the monastic life of his grandfather at\r\nYuste. Yet Don Garcia does not fail to intimate his discontent with the\r\nwant of interest shown by his pupil, not merely in his studies, but in\r\nfencing, cane-playing, and other manly exercises, so essential to the\r\neducation of a cavalier of that day.[1406] He notices, at the same time,\r\nthe first symptoms of those bilious attacks which already menaced the\r\nprince's constitution, and so effectually undermined it in later\r\nyears.[1407]\r\n\r\nIn another epistle, Don Garcia suggests that it might be well for the\r\nemperor to allow Carlos to visit him at Yuste, trusting that his\r\ngrandfather's authority would accomplish what his own had failed to\r\ndo.[1408] But this suggestion found no favor, apparently, with the royal\r\nrecluse, who probably was not disposed to do penance himself by\r\nreceiving so troublesome an inmate in his family. The emperor's own\r\ndeath, which occurred shortly after this, spared him the misery of\r\nwitnessing the disastrous career of his grandson.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS EDUCATION AND CHARACTER.]\r\n\r\nThe reports of the Venetian ministers--those precious documents that\r\ncontain so much instruction in respect to matters both of public and\r\ndomestic interest--make occasional allusions to the prince, at this\r\nperiod. Their notices are by no means flattering. They describe Carlos\r\nas of a reckless, impatient temper, fierce, and even cruel, in his\r\ndisposition,[1409] and so arrogant as to be unwilling to stand with his\r\nhead uncovered, for any long time, in the presence of the emperor or\r\nhis father.[1410] Yet this harsh picture is somewhat redeemed by other\r\ntraits; for he was generous, though to a degree of prodigality,--giving\r\naway his trinkets and jewels, even his clothes, in default of money. He\r\nhad a fearless heart, with a strong passion for a military life. He was\r\nfar from frivolous in his tastes, despising buffoons, and saying himself\r\nso many good things that his tutor carefully made a collection of\r\nthem.[1411] This portrait of a youth scarcely fourteen years old seems\r\nas highly overcharged, whether for good or for evil, as portraits of\r\nprinces usually are.\r\n\r\nYet the state of the prince's health may be fairly mentioned in\r\nextenuation of his defects,--at least of his infirmity of temper. For\r\nhis bilious temperament already began to show itself in the form of\r\nintermittent fever, with which he continued to be afflicted for the\r\nremainder of his life. Under this depressing disorder, his spirits sank,\r\nhis body wasted away, and his strength failed to such a degree, that it\r\nwas feared he might not reach the age of manhood.[1412]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1560, Isabella of France came to Castile, and on the\r\nsecond of February was united to Philip. By the preliminaries of the\r\ntreaty of Cateau-Cambresis, her hand had been assigned to Don Carlos;\r\nbut Mary Tudor having died before the ratification of the treaty, the\r\nname of the father was substituted for that of the son, and the royal\r\nmaiden was affianced to Philip.\r\n\r\nThe marriage ceremony was performed with great splendor, at Toledo.\r\nCarlos was present; and, as he gazed on the beautiful bride, it is not\r\nimprobable that some feelings of resentment may have mingled with\r\nregret, when he thought of the unceremonious manner in which her hand\r\nhad been transferred from him to his father. But we should be slow to\r\nbelieve that Isabella could have felt anything like the tender sentiment\r\nthat romantic historians have attributed to her, for a boy of fourteen,\r\nwho had so few personal attractions to recommend him.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-second of the same month, Carlos was formally recognized\r\nby the cortes of Castile as heir to the crown. On this occasion, the\r\ndifferent members of the royal family were present, together with the\r\ngreat nobles and the representatives of the commons. The prince rode in\r\nthe procession on a white horse, superbly caparisoned while his dress,\r\nresplendent with jewels, formed a sad contrast to the sallow and sickly\r\ncountenance of its wearer.[1413] He performed his part of the ceremony\r\nwith dignity and feeling. When Joanna, his aunt, and his uncle, Don John\r\nof Austria, after taking the oath, would have knelt, according to\r\ncustom, to kiss his hand, he would not allow it, but affectionately\r\nraised and embraced them. But when the duke of Alva inadvertently\r\nomitted the latter act of obeisance, the prince received him so coldly,\r\nthat the haughty nobleman, rebuked by his manner, perceived his error,\r\nand humbly acknowledged it.[1414]\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of the following year, with the hope of mending his health\r\nby change of air, Carlos removed to Alcalá de Henares, famous for its\r\nuniversity founded by the great Ximenes. He had for his companions two\r\nyouths, both destined to a conspicuous part in the history of the times.\r\nOne was Philip's illegitimate brother, Don John of Austria, the hero of\r\nLepanto; the other was the prince's cousin, Alexander Farnese, son of\r\nMargaret of Parma, who was now in the course of training which was one\r\nday to make him the greatest captain of his time. The three boys were\r\nnearly of the same age; but in their accomplishments and personal\r\nappearance the uncle and the cousin afforded as strong a contrast to\r\ntheir royal kinsman, as in the brilliant fortunes that awaited\r\nthem.[1415]\r\n\r\nCarlos had not been at Alcalá many months, before he met with an\r\naccident, which was attended with most disastrous consequences. One\r\nevening in April, 1562, as he was descending a flight of stairs, he made\r\na misstep, and fell headlong down five or six stairs against a door at\r\nthe bottom of the passage. He was taken up senseless, and removed to his\r\nchamber, where his physicians were instantly summoned, and the necessary\r\nremedies applied.[1416] At first it seemed only a simple contusion on\r\nthe head, and the applications of the doctors had the desired effect.\r\nBut soon the symptoms became more alarming. Fever set in. He was\r\nattacked by erysipelas; his head swelled to an enormous size; he became\r\ntotally blind; and this was followed by delirium. It now appeared that\r\nthe skull was fractured. The royal physicians were called in; and after\r\na stormy consultation, in which the doctors differed, as usual, as to\r\nthe remedies to be applied, it was determined to trepan the patient. The\r\noperation was carefully performed; a part of the bone of the skull was\r\nremoved; but relief was not obtained.[1417]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DANGEROUS ILLNESS AND RECOVERY.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the greatest alarm spread through the country, at the prospect\r\nof losing the heir apparent. Processions were everywhere made to the\r\nchurches, prayers were put up, pilgrimages were vowed, and the\r\ndiscipline was unsparingly administered by the fanatical multitude, who\r\nhoped by selfinflicted penance to avert the wrath of Heaven from the\r\nland. Yet all did not avail.\r\n\r\nWe have a report of the case from the pen of Dr. Olivares, the prince's\r\nown physician. Some of the remedies were of a kind that would look\r\nstrangely enough if reported by a medical journal of our own day. After\r\nall efforts of professional skill had failed, and the unguent of a\r\nMoorish doctor, famous among the people, had been rubbed on the body\r\nwithout success, it was resolved to make a direct appeal to Heaven. In\r\nthe monastery of Jesus Maria lay the bones of a holy Franciscan, Fray\r\nDiego, who had died a hundred years before, in the reign of Henry the\r\nFourth, in the odor of sanctity. King Philip and his court went in\r\nsolemn procession to the church; and in their presence, the mouldering\r\nremains of the good father, still sweet to the nostrils, as we are told,\r\nwere taken from their iron coffin, and transported to the prince's\r\napartment. They were there laid on his bed; and the cloth that wrapped\r\nthe skull of the dead man was placed on the forehead of Carlos.[1418]\r\nFortunately the delirious state of the patient prevented the shock that\r\nmight otherwise have been given to his senses. That very night the friar\r\nappeared to Carlos in his sleep. He was muffled in his Franciscan robe,\r\nwith a green girdle about his waist, and a cross of reeds in his hand;\r\nand he mildly bade him \"be of good cheer, for that he would certainly\r\nrecover.\" From this time, as the physician who reports the case admits,\r\nthe patient began speedily to mend. The fever subsided, his head\r\nreturned to its natural dimensions, his eyes were restored to sight. At\r\nthe end of something less than two months from the date of the accident,\r\nCarlos, who had shown a marvellous docility throughout his\r\nillness,[1419] was enabled to walk into the adjoining apartment, and\r\nembrace his father, who, during the critical period of his son's\r\nillness, had established his residence at Alcalá, showing the solicitude\r\nnatural to a parent in such an extremity.\r\n\r\nThe merit of the cure was of course referred to Fray Diego.[1420] An\r\naccount of the miracle, duly authenticated, was transmitted to Rome; and\r\nthe holy man, on the application of Philip, received the honors of\r\ncanonization from the pontiff. The claims of the new saint to the credit\r\nof achieving the cure were confidently asserted by the Castilian\r\nchroniclers of that and succeeding ages; nor have I met with any one\r\nhardy enough to contest them, unless it be Dr. Olivares himself, who,\r\nnaturally jealous of his professional honor, intimated his\r\nconviction,--this was before the canonization,--that with some\r\nallowance for the good wrought by Fray Diego's intercession and the\r\nprayers of the righteous, the recovery of the prince was mainly to be\r\nreferred to the skill of his physicians.[1421]\r\n\r\nBut the recovery of Carlos does not seem to have been so complete as was\r\nat first thought. There is good reason to suppose that the blow on his\r\nhead did some permanent injury to the brain. At least this may be\r\ninferred from the absurd eccentricities of his subsequent conduct, and\r\nthe reckless manner in which he abandoned himself to the gratification\r\nof his passions. In 1565, on his recovery from one of those attacks of\r\nquartan-fever which still beset him, Philip remarked, with a sigh, to\r\nthe French minister, St. Sulpice, \"that he hoped his repeated warnings\r\nmight restrain the prince, for the future, from making such fatal\r\ninroads on his health.\"[1422] But the unfortunate young man profited as\r\nlittle by such warnings as by his own experience. Persons about the\r\ncourt at this period have left us many stories of his mad humors, which\r\nformed the current scandal at Madrid. Brantôme, who was there in 1564,\r\nsays that Carlos would patrol the streets with a number of young nobles,\r\nof the same lawless habits with himself, assaulting the passengers with\r\ndrawn swords, kissing the women, and insulting even ladies of the\r\nhighest rank with the most opprobrious epithets.[1423]\r\n\r\nIt was the fashion for the young gallants of the court to wear very\r\nlarge boots. Carlos had his made even larger than usual, to accommodate\r\na pair of small pistols. Philip, in order to prevent the mischievous\r\npractice, ordered his son's boots to be made of smaller dimensions. But\r\nwhen the bootmaker brought them to the palace, Carlos, in a rage, gave\r\nhim a beating; and then, ordering the leather to be cut in pieces and\r\nstewed, he forced the unlucky mechanic to swallow this unsavory\r\nfricassee--as much as he could get down of it--on the spot.[1424]\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, he made a violent assault on his governor, Don Garcia\r\nde Toledo, for some slight cause of offence. On another, he would have\r\nthrown his chamberlain, Don Alonzo de Cordova, out of the window. These\r\nnoblemen complained to Philip, and besought him to release them from a\r\nservice where they were exposed to affronts which they could not resent.\r\nThe king consented, transferring them to his own service, and appointed\r\nRuy Gomez de Silva, prince of Eboli, his favorite minister, the governor\r\nof Carlos.[1425]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS DISPOSITION.]\r\n\r\nBut the prince was no respecter of persons. Cardinal Espinosa, president\r\nof the Council of Castile, and afterwards grand-inquisitor, banished a\r\nplayer named Cisneros from the palace, where he was to have performed\r\nthat night for the prince's diversion. It was probably by Philip's\r\norders. But however that may be, Carlos, meeting the cardinal, seized\r\nhim roughly by the collar, and, laying his hand on his poniard,\r\nexclaimed, \"You scurvy priest, do you dare to prevent Cisneros from\r\nplaying before me? By the life of my father, I will kill you!\"[1426] The\r\ntrembling prelate, throwing himself on his knees, was too happy to\r\nescape with his life from the hands of the infuriated prince. Whether\r\nthe latter had his way in the end, in regard to the comedian, is not\r\nstated. But the stuff of which a grand-inquisitor is made is not apt to\r\nbe of the yielding sort.\r\n\r\nA more whimsical anecdote is told us by Nobili, the Tuscan ambassador,\r\nthen resident at the court. Carlos, having need of money, requested a\r\nmerchant, named Grimaldo, to advance him the sum of fifteen hundred\r\nducats. The money-lender readily consented, thanking the prince for the\r\nfavor done him, and adding, in the usual grandiloquent vein of the\r\nCastilian, that \"all he had was at his disposal.\"[1427] Carlos took him\r\nat his word, and forthwith demanded a hundred thousand ducats. In vain\r\npoor Grimaldo, astounded by the request, protested that \"it would ruin\r\nhis credit; that what he had said was only words of compliment.\" Carlos\r\nreplied, \"he had no right to bandy compliments with princes; and if he\r\ndid not in four and twenty hours pay the money to the last _real_, he\r\nand his family would have cause to rue it.\" It was not till after much\r\nnegotiation that Ruy Gomez succeeded in prevailing on the prince to be\r\ncontent with the more modest sum of sixty thousand ducats, which was\r\naccordingly furnished by the unfortunate merchant.[1428] The money thus\r\ngained, according to Nobili, was squandered as suddenly as it was got.\r\n\r\nThere are happily some touches of light to relieve the shadows with\r\nwhich the portrait is charged. Tiepolo, who was ambassador from Venice\r\nat the court of Madrid in 1567, when Carlos was twenty-two years old,\r\ngives us some account of the prince. He admits his arrogant and fiery\r\ntemper, but commends his love of truth, and, what we should hardly have\r\nexpected, the earnestness with which he engaged in his devotions. He was\r\nexceedingly charitable, asking, \"Who would give, if princes did\r\nnot?\"[1429] He was splendid in his way of living, making the most\r\nliberal recompense, not only to his own servants, but to the king's, who\r\nwere greatly attached to him.[1430] He was ambitious of taking part in\r\nthe conduct of public affairs, and was sorely discontented when excluded\r\nfrom them--as seems to have been usually the case--by his father.[1431]\r\n\r\nIt was certainly to the prince's credit, that he was able to inspire\r\nthose who approached him most nearly with strong feelings of personal\r\nattachment. Among these were his aunt Joanna, the regent, and the queen,\r\nIsabella, who, regarding him with an interest justified by the\r\nconnection, was desirous of seeing him married to her own sister. His\r\naunt Mary and her husband, the Emperor Maximilian, also held Carlos,\r\nwhom they had known in early days, in the kindest remembrance, and\r\nwished to secure his hand for their eldest daughter. A still more\r\nhonorable testimony is borne by the relations in which he stood to his\r\npreceptor, Honorato Juan, who, at the prince's solicitation, had been\r\nraised to the bishopric of Osma. Carlos would willingly have kept this\r\ngood man near his own person. But he was detained in his diocese; and\r\nthe letters from time to time addressed to him by his former pupil,\r\nwhatever may be thought of them as pieces of composition, do honor to\r\nthe prince's heart. \"My best friend in this life,\" he affectionately\r\nwrites at the close of them, \"I will do all that you desire.\"[1432]\r\nUnfortunately, this good friend and counsellor died in 1566. By his\r\nwill, he requested Carlos to select for himself any article among his\r\neffects that he preferred. He even gave him authority to change the\r\nterms of the instrument, and make any other disposition of his property\r\nthat he thought right![1433] It was a singular proof of confidence in\r\nthe testator, unless we are to receive it merely as a Spanish\r\ncompliment,--somewhat perilous, as the case of Grimaldo proves, with a\r\nperson who interpreted compliments as literally as Carlos.\r\n\r\nFrom all this, there would seem to have been the germs of generous\r\nqualities in the prince's nature, which, under a happier culture, might\r\nhave been turned to some account. But he was placed in that lofty\r\nstation which exposed him to the influence of parasites, who flattered\r\nhis pride, and corrupted his heart, by ministering to his pleasures.\r\nFrom the eminence which he occupied, even the smallest errors and\r\neccentricities became visible to the world, and the objects of unsparing\r\ncriticism. Somewhat resembling his father in person, he was different\r\nfrom him both in his good qualities and his defects, so that a complete\r\nbarrier was raised between them. Neither party could comprehend the\r\nother; and the father was thus destitute of the means which he might\r\nelse have had of exerting an influence over the son. The prince's\r\ndissipated way of life, his perpetual lapses from decorum, or, to speak\r\nmore properly, his reckless defiance of decency, outraged his father, so\r\npunctilious in his own observance of the outward decencies of life. He\r\nmay well have dwelt on such excesses of Carlos with pain; but it may be\r\ndoubted if the prince's more honorable desire to mingle in public\r\naffairs was to the taste of Philip, who was too tenacious of power\r\nwillingly to delegate it, beyond what was absolutely necessary, to his\r\nown ministers. The conduct of his son, unhappily, furnished him with a\r\nplausible ground for distrusting his capacity for business.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS CONNECTION WITH THE FLEMINGS.]\r\n\r\nThus distrusted, if not held in positive aversion, by his father;\r\nexcluded from any share in the business of the state, as well as from a\r\nmilitary life, which would seem to have been well suited to his\r\ndisposition; surrounded by Philip's ministers, whom Carlos, with too\r\nmuch reason, regarded as spies on his actions,--the unhappy young man\r\ngave himself up to a reckless course of life, equally ruinous to his\r\nconstitution and to his character; until the people, who had hailed with\r\ndelight the prospect of a native-born prince, now felt a reasonable\r\napprehension as to his capacity for government.[1434]\r\n\r\nBut while thus an object of distrust at home, abroad more than one\r\nsovereign coveted an alliance with the heir of the Spanish monarchy.\r\nCatharine de Medicis would gladly have secured his hand for a younger\r\nsister of Isabella, in which project she was entirely favored by the\r\nqueen. This was in 1565; but Philip, in his usual procrastinating\r\nspirit, only replied, \"They must reflect upon it.\"[1435] He looked with\r\na more favorable eye on the proposals warmly pressed by the emperor and\r\nempress of Germany, who, as we have seen, still cherished a kindly\r\nremembrance of Carlos, and wished his union with their daughter Anne.\r\nThat princess, who was a year younger than her cousin, claimed Spain as\r\nher native land, having been born there during the regency of\r\nMaximilian. But although the parties were of suitable age, and Philip\r\nacquiesced in the proposals for their marriage, his want of confidence\r\nin his son, if we may credit the historians, still moved him to defer\r\nthe celebration of it.[1436] Anne did indeed live to mount the throne of\r\nCastile, but as the wife, not of Carlos, but of Philip, after the death\r\nof Isabella. Thus, by a singular fatality, the two princesses who had\r\nbeen destined for the son were each of them married to the father.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary movement in the Netherlands was at this time the great\r\nsubject that engaged the attention of the Spaniards; and Carlos is\r\nreported to have taken a lively interest in it. According to Antonio\r\nPerez, the Flemings then at the court made positive overtures to the\r\nprince to head the revolt.[1437] Strada speaks of Bergen and Montigny,\r\nthen at Madrid, as the channel of communication through which Carlos\r\nengaged to settle the affairs of that distracted country.[1438] That a\r\nperson of his ardent temper should have felt sympathy with a people thus\r\nbravely struggling for its liberties, is not improbable; nor would one\r\nwith whom \"to think and to speak was the same thing,\"[1439] be at all\r\nunlikely to express himself on the subject with much more freedom than\r\ndiscretion. And it may have been in allusion to this that his almoner,\r\nSuarez, in a letter without date, implores the prince \"to abandon his\r\ndangerous designs, the illusion of the Evil One, which cannot fail to\r\nbring mischief to himself and disquiet to the monarchy!\"[1440] The\r\nletter concludes with a homily, in which the good doctor impresses on\r\nthe prince the necessity of filial obedience, by numerous examples, from\r\nsacred and profane story, of the sad end of those who had impiously\r\nrejected the counsels of their parents.[1441]\r\n\r\nBut although it is true that this hypothesis would explain much that is\r\nenigmatical in the subsequent history of Carlos, I must confess I have\r\nmet with no confirmation of it in the correspondence of those who had\r\nthe direction of affairs in the Low Countries, nor in the charges\r\nalleged against Montigny himself,--where an attempt to suborn the\r\nheir-apparent, one might suppose, would have been paraded as the most\r\nheinous offence. Still, that Carlos regarded himself as the proper\r\nperson to be intrusted with the mission to the Netherlands is evident\r\nfrom his treatment of Alva, when that nobleman was appointed to the\r\ncommand of the army.\r\n\r\nOn that occasion, as the duke came to pay his respects to him previous\r\nto his departure, the prince fiercely said, \"You are not to go to\r\nFlanders; I will go there myself.\" Alva endeavored to pacify him, saying\r\nthat it was too dangerous a mission for the heir to the throne; that he\r\nwas going to quiet the troubles of the country, and prepare it for the\r\ncoming of the king, when the prince could accompany his father, if his\r\npresence could be spared in Castile. But this explanation served only to\r\nirritate Carlos the more; and, drawing his dagger, he turned suddenly on\r\nthe duke, exclaiming, \"You shall not go; if you do, I will kill you.\" A\r\nstruggle ensued,--an awkward one for Alva, as to have injured the\r\nheir-apparent might have been construed into treason. Fortunately, being\r\nmuch the stronger of the two, he grappled with Carlos, and held him\r\ntight, while the latter exhausted his strength in ineffectual struggles\r\nto escape. But no sooner was the prince released, than he turned again,\r\nwith the fury of a madman, on the duke, who again closed with him, when\r\nthe noise of the fray brought in one of the chamberlains from an\r\nadjoining room; and Carlos, extricating himself from the iron grasp of\r\nhis adversary, withdrew to his own apartment.[1442]\r\n\r\nSuch an outrage on the person of his minister was regarded by Philip as\r\nan indignity to himself. It widened the breach, already too wide,\r\nbetween father and son; and so great was this estrangement, that, when\r\nliving in the same palace, they seem to have had no communication with\r\neach other.[1443] Much of Philip's time, however, at this period, was\r\npassed at the Escorial, where he was watching over the progress of the\r\nmagnificent pile which was to commemorate the victory of St. Quentin.\r\nBut, while in his retreat, the ministers placed about his son furnished\r\nthe king with faithful reports of his proceedings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PROJECT OF FLIGHT.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the deplorable state of things, when Carlos came to the fatal\r\ndetermination to escape from the annoyances of his present position by\r\nflying to some foreign land. To what country is not certainly known;\r\nsome say to the Netherlands, others to Germany. The latter, on the\r\nwhole, seems the most probable; as in the court of Vienna he would meet\r\nwith his promised bride, and friends who would be sure to welcome him.\r\n\r\nAs he was destitute of funds for such a journey, he proposed to raise\r\nthem through a confidential agent, one of his own household, by\r\nobtaining loans from different cities. Such a reckless mode of\r\nproceeding, which seemed at once to proclaim his purpose, intimated too\r\nplainly the heedlessness of his character, and his utter ignorance of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nBut while these negotiations were in progress, a circumstance occurred,\r\nexhibiting the conduct of Carlos in such a light that it may claim the\r\nshelter of insanity. The story is told by one of the prince's household,\r\nan _ayuda de camara_, or gentleman of the chamber, who was present at\r\nthe scene, which he describes with much simplicity.\r\n\r\nFor some days his master, he tells us, had no rest, frequently\r\nrepeating, that \"he desired to kill a man with whom he had a\r\nquarrel!\"[1444] The same thing he said--without, however, intimating who\r\nthe man was--to his uncle, Don John of Austria, in whom he seems to have\r\nplaced unbounded confidence. This was near Christmas, in 1567. It was\r\ncustomary on the twenty-eighth of December, the day of the Innocents,\r\nfor the members of the royal family to appear together, and take the\r\nsacrament in public. Carlos, in order to prepare for this, on the\r\npreceding evening went to the church of St. Jerome, to confess and\r\nreceive absolution. But the confessor, when he heard the strange avowal\r\nof his murderous appetite, refused to grant absolution. Carlos applied\r\nto another ecclesiastic, but with as little success. In vain he\r\nendeavored to argue the case. They recommended him to send for more\r\nlearned divines, and take their opinion. He did so forthwith; and no\r\nless than fourteen monks from the convent of Our Lady of Atocha, and two\r\nfrom another quarter, were brought together to settle this strange point\r\nof casuistry. Greatly shocked, they were unanimous in their opinion,\r\nthat, under the circumstances, absolution could not be granted. Carlos\r\nnext inquired whether he might not be allowed to receive an\r\nunconsecrated wafer, which would obviate the scandal that his omitting\r\nto take the sacrament would infallibly occasion in the court. The\r\nreverend body were thrown into fresh consternation by this proposal. The\r\nprior of Atocha, who was among the number, wishing to draw from Carlos\r\nthe name of his enemy, told him that this intelligence might possibly\r\nhave some influence on the judgment of the divines. The prince replied,\r\nthat \"his father was the person, and that he wished to have his\r\nlife!\"[1445] The prior calmly inquired, if any one was to aid him in the\r\ndesigns against his father. But Carlos only repeated his former\r\ndeclaration; and two hours after midnight the conclave broke up in\r\nunspeakable dismay. A messenger was despatched to the Escorial, where\r\nthe king then was, to acquaint him with the whole affair.[1446]\r\n\r\nSuch is the report of the _ayuda de camara_, who says he was in\r\nattendance on the prince that night. The authority is better for some\r\nparts of the story than for others. There is nothing very improbable in\r\nthe supposition that Carlos--whose thoughts, as we have seen, lay very\r\nnear the surface--should have talked, in the wild way reported of him,\r\nto his attendants. But that he should have repeated to others what had\r\nbeen drawn from him so cunningly by the prior, or that this appalling\r\nsecret should have been whispered within earshot of the attendants, is\r\ndifficult to believe. It matters little, however, since, whichever way\r\nwe take the story, it savors so much of downright madness in the prince\r\nas in a manner to relieve him from moral responsibility.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of January, 1568, the prince's agent had returned,\r\nbringing with him a hundred and fifty thousand ducats. It was not more\r\nthan a fourth of the amount he had demanded. But it answered for the\r\npresent, and the remainder he proposed to have sent after him in bills\r\nof exchange.[1447] Having completed his preparations, he communicated\r\nhis intentions to his uncle, Don John, and besought him to accompany him\r\nin his flight. But the latter, after fruitlessly expostulating with his\r\nkinsman on the folly of his proceeding, left Madrid for the Escorial,\r\nwhere he doubtless reported the affair to the king, his brother.\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth, Carlos sent an order to Don Ramon de Tassis, the\r\ndirector-general of the posts, to have eight horses in readiness for\r\nhim, that evening. Tassis, suspecting all was not right, returned an\r\nanswer that the horses were out. On the prince repeating his orders in a\r\nmore peremptory manner, the postmaster sent all the horses out, and\r\nproceeded himself in all haste to the Escorial.[1448]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS ARREST.]\r\n\r\nThe king was not long in taking his measures. Some days previous, \"this\r\nvery religious prince,\" says the papal nuncio, \"according to his wont,\r\nhad caused prayers to be put up, in the different monasteries, for the\r\nguidance of Heaven in an affair of great moment.\"[1449] Such prayers\r\nmight have served as a warning to Carlos. But it was too late for\r\nwarnings. Philip now proceeded, without loss of time, to Madrid, where\r\nthose who beheld him in the audience-chamber, on the morning of the\r\neighteenth, saw no sign of the coming storm in the serenity of his\r\ncountenance.[1450] That morning, he attended mass in public, with the\r\nmembers of the royal family. After the services, Don John visited Carlos\r\nin his apartment, when the prince, shutting the doors, demanded of his\r\nuncle the subject of his conversation with the king at the Escorial. Don\r\nJohn evaded the questions as well as he could, till Carlos, heated by\r\nhis suspicions, drew his sword, and attacked his uncle, who, retreating,\r\nwith his back to the door, called loudly on the prince to desist, and\r\nthrew himself into a posture of defence. The noise made by the skirmish\r\nfortunately drew the notice of the attendants, who, rushing in, enabled\r\nDon John to retreat, and Carlos withdrew in sullen silence to his\r\nchamber.[1451]\r\n\r\nThe prince, it seems, had for some time felt himself insecure in his\r\nfather's palace. He slept with as many precautions as a highwayman, with\r\nhis sword and dagger by his side, and a loaded musket within reach,\r\nready at any moment for action.[1452] For further security, he had\r\ncaused an ingenious artisan to construct a bolt, in such a way that by\r\nmeans of pulleys he could fasten or unfasten the door of his chamber\r\nwhile in bed. With such precautions, it would be a perilous thing to\r\ninvade the slumbers of a desperate man like Carlos. But Philip was aware\r\nof the difficulties; and he ordered the mechanic to derange the\r\nmachinery so that it should not work: and thus the door was left without\r\nthe usual means for securing it.[1453] The rest is told by the _ayuda de\r\ncamara_ above mentioned, who was on duty that night, and supped in the\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nIt was about eleven o'clock, on the evening of the eighteenth, when he\r\nobserved the king coming down stairs, wearing armor over his clothes,\r\nand his head protected by a helmet. He was accompanied by the duke of\r\nFeria, captain of the guard, with four or five other lords, and twelve\r\nprivates of the guard. The king ordered the valet to shut the door, and\r\nallow no one to enter. The nobles and the guard then passed into the\r\nprince's chamber; and the duke of Feria, stealing softly to the head of\r\nthe bed, secured a sword and dagger which lay there, as well as a musket\r\nloaded with two balls. Carlos, roused by the noise, started up, and\r\ndemanded who was there. The duke, having got possession of the weapons,\r\nreplied, \"It is the council of state.\" Carlos, on hearing this, leaped\r\nfrom his bed, and, uttering loud cries and menaces, endeavored to seize\r\nhis arms. At this moment, Philip, who had prudently deferred his\r\nentrance till the weapons were mastered, came forward, and bade his son\r\nreturn to bed and remain quiet. The prince exclaimed, \"What does your\r\nmajesty want of me?\" \"You will soon learn,\" said his father, and at the\r\nsame time ordered the windows and doors to be strongly secured, and the\r\nkeys of the latter to be delivered to him. All the furniture of the\r\nroom, with which Carlos could commit any violence, even the andirons,\r\nwere removed.[1454] The king, then turning to Feria, told him that \"he\r\ncommitted the prince to his especial charge, and that he must guard him\r\nwell.\" Addressing next the other nobles, he directed them \"to serve the\r\nprince with all proper respect, but to execute none of his orders\r\nwithout first reporting them to himself; finally, to guard him\r\nfaithfully, under penalty of being held as traitors.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words Carlos exclaimed, \"Your majesty had better kill me than\r\nkeep me a prisoner. It will be a great scandal to the kingdom. If you do\r\nnot kill me, I will make away with myself.\" \"You will do no such thing,\"\r\nsaid the king; \"for that would be the act of a madman.\" \"Your majesty,\"\r\nreplied Carlos, \"treats me so ill that you force me to this extremity. I\r\nam not mad, but you drive me to despair!\"[1455] Other words passed\r\nbetween the monarch and his son, whose voice was so broken with sobs as\r\nto be scarcely audible.[1456]\r\n\r\nHaving completed his arrangements, Philip, after securing a coffer which\r\ncontained the prince's papers, withdrew from the apartment. That night,\r\nthe duke of Feria, the count of Lerma, and Don Rodrigo de Mendoza,\r\neldest son of Ruy Gomez, remained in the prince's chamber. Two lords,\r\nout of six named for the purpose, performed the same duty in rotation\r\neach succeeding night. From respect to the prince, none of them were\r\nallowed to wear their swords in his presence. His meat was cut up before\r\nit was brought into his chamber, as he was allowed no knife at his\r\nmeals. The prince's attendants were all dismissed, and most of them\r\nafterwards provided for in the service of the king. A guard of twelve\r\nhalberdiers were stationed in the passages leading to the tower in which\r\nthe apartment of Carlos was situated. Thus all communication from\r\nwithout was cut off; and, as he was unable to look from his strongly\r\nbarricaded windows, the unhappy prisoner from that time remained as dead\r\nto the world as if he had been buried in the deepest dungeon of\r\nSimancas.\r\n\r\nThe following day, the king called the members of his different councils\r\ntogether, and informed them of the arrest of his son, declaring that\r\nnothing but his duty to God, and the welfare of the monarchy, could have\r\nmoved him to such an act. The tears, according to one present, filled\r\nhis eyes, as he made this avowal.[1457]\r\n\r\nHe then summoned his council of state, and commenced a process against\r\nthe prisoner. His affliction did not prevent him from being present all\r\nthe while, and listening to the testimony, which, when reduced to\r\nwriting, formed a heap of paper half a foot in thickness.--Such is the\r\naccount given of this extraordinary proceeding by the _ayuda de\r\ncamara_.[1458]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CAUSES OF HIS IMPRISONMENT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF DON CARLOS.\r\n\r\nCauses of his Imprisonment.--His Rigorous Confinement.--His\r\nExcesses.--His Death.--Llorente's Account.--Various\r\nAccounts.--Suspicious Circumstances.--Quarrel in the Palace.--Obsequies\r\nof Carlos.\r\n\r\n1568.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe arrest of Don Carlos caused a great sensation throughout the\r\ncountry, much increased by the mysterious circumstances which had\r\nattended it. The wildest rumors were afloat as to the cause. Some said\r\nthe prince had meditated a design against his father's life; others,\r\nthat he had conspired against that of Ruy Gomez. Some said that he was\r\nplotting rebellion, and had taken part with the Flemings; others\r\nsuspected him of heresy. Many took still a different view of the\r\nmatter,--censuring the father rather than the son. \"_His dagger followed\r\nclose upon his smile_,\" says the historian of Philip; \"hence some called\r\nhim wise, others severe.\"[1459] Carlos, they said, never a favorite,\r\nmight have been rash in his thoughts and words; but he had done no act\r\nwhich should have led a father to deal with his son so harshly. But\r\nprinces are too apt to be jealous of their successors. They distrusted\r\nthe bold and generous spirit of their offspring, whom it would be wiser\r\nto win over by admitting them to some reasonable share in the\r\ngovernment.--\"But others there were,\" concludes the wise chronicler of\r\nthe times, \"who, more prudent than their neighbors, laid their finger on\r\ntheir lips, and were silent.\"[1460]\r\n\r\nFor some days, Philip would allow no post to leave Madrid, that he might\r\nbe the first to send intelligence of this event to foreign courts.[1461]\r\nOn the twenty-fourth, he despatched circular letters to the great\r\necclesiastics, the grandees, and the municipalities of the chief cities\r\nof the kingdom. They were vague in their import, stating the fact of the\r\narrest, and assigning much the same general grounds with those he had\r\nstated to the councils. On the same day he sent despatches to the\r\nprincipal courts of Europe. These, though singularly vague and\r\nmysterious in their language, were more pregnant with suggestions, at\r\nleast, than the letters to his subjects. The most curious, on the whole,\r\nand the one that gives the best insight into his motives, is the letter\r\nhe addressed to his aunt, the queen of Portugal. She was sister to the\r\nemperor, his father,--an estimable lady, whom Philip had always held in\r\ngreat respect.\r\n\r\n\"Although,\" he writes, \"it has long been obvious that it was necessary\r\nto take some order in regard to the prince, yet the feelings of a father\r\nhave led me to resort to all other means before proceeding to extremity.\r\nBut affairs have at length come to such a pass, that, to fulfil the duty\r\nwhich, as a Christian prince, I owe both to God and to my realm, I have\r\nbeen compelled to place my son in strict confinement. Thus have I been\r\nwilling to sacrifice to God my own flesh and blood, preferring his\r\nservice and the welfare of my people to all human considerations.[1462]\r\nI will only add, that this determination has not been brought about by\r\nany misconduct on the part of my son, or by any want of respect to me;\r\nnor is this treatment of him intended by way of chastisement,--for that,\r\nhowever just the grounds of it, would have its time and its limit.[1463]\r\nNeither have I resorted to it as an expedient for reforming his\r\ndisorderly life. The proceeding rests altogether on another foundation;\r\nand the _remedy I propose is not one either of time or expedients_, but\r\nis of the greatest moment, as I have already remarked, to satisfy my\r\nobligations to God and my people.\"[1464]\r\n\r\nIn the same obscure strain, Philip addressed Zuñiga, his ambassador at\r\nthe papal court,--saying, that, \"although the disobedience which Carlos\r\nhad shown through life was sufficient to justify any demonstration of\r\nseverity, yet it was not this, but the stern pressure of necessity, that\r\ncould alone have driven him to deal in this way with his first-born, his\r\nonly son.\"[1465]\r\n\r\nThis ambiguous language--implying that the imprisonment of Carlos was\r\nnot occasioned by his own misconduct, and yet that both the interests of\r\nreligion and the safety of the state demanded his perpetual\r\nimprisonment--may be thought to intimate that the cause referred to\r\ncould be no other than insanity. This was plainly stated by the prince\r\nof Eboli, in a communication which, by the king's order, he made to the\r\nFrench minister, Fourquevaulx. The king, Gomez said, had for three years\r\npast perceived that the prince's head was the weakest part of him, and\r\nthat he was, at no time, in complete possession of his understanding. He\r\nhad been silent on the matter, trusting that time would bring some\r\namendment. But it had only made things worse; and he saw, with sorrow,\r\nthat to commit the sceptre to his son's hands would be to bring\r\ninevitable misery on his subjects and ruin on the state. With\r\nunspeakable anguish, he had therefore resolved, after long deliberation,\r\nto place his son under constraint.[1466]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CAUSES OF HIS IMPRISONMENT.]\r\n\r\nThis at least is intelligible, and very different from Philip's own\r\ndespatches,--where it strikes us as strange, if insanity were the true\r\nground of the arrest, that it should be covered up under such vague and\r\nequivocal language, with the declaration, moreover, usually made in his\r\nletters, that, \"at some future time, he would explain the matter more\r\nfully to the parties.\" One might have thought that the simple plea of\r\ninsanity would have been directly given, as furnishing the best apology\r\nfor the son, and at the same time vindicating the father for imposing a\r\nwholesome restraint upon his person. But, in point of fact, the\r\nexcessive rigor of the confinement, as we shall have occasion to see,\r\nsavored much more of the punishment dealt out to some high offender,\r\nthan of the treatment of an unfortunate lunatic. Neither is it probable\r\nthat a criminal process would have been instituted against one who, by\r\nhis very infirmity, was absolved from all moral responsibility.\r\n\r\nThere are two documents, either of which, should it ever be brought to\r\nlight, would probably unfold the true reasons of the arrest of Carlos.\r\nThe Spanish ambassador, Zuñiga, informed Philip that the pope,\r\ndissatisfied with the account which he had given of the transaction,\r\ndesired a further explanation of it from his majesty.[1467] This, from\r\nsuch a source, was nearly equivalent to a command. For Philip had a\r\npeculiar reverence for Pius the Fifth, the pope of the Inquisition, who\r\nwas a pontiff after his own heart. The king is said never to have passed\r\nby the portrait of his holiness, which hung on the walls of the palace,\r\nwithout taking off his hat.[1468] He at once wrote a letter to the pope\r\ncontaining a full account of the transaction. It was written in cipher,\r\nwith the recommendation that it should be submitted to Granvelle, then\r\nin Rome, if his holiness could not interpret it. This letter is\r\ndoubtless in the Vatican.[1469]\r\n\r\nThe other document is the process. The king, immediately after the\r\narrest of his son, appointed a special commission to try him. It\r\nconsisted of Cardinal Espinosa, the prince of Eboli, and a royal\r\ncouncillor, Bribiesca de Muñatones, who was appointed to prepare the\r\nindictment. The writings containing the memorable process instituted by\r\nPhilip's ancestor, John the Second of Aragon, against his amiable and\r\nunfortunate son, who also bore the name of Carlos, had been obtained\r\nfrom the Archives of Barcelona. They were translated from the Catalan\r\ninto Castilian, and served for the ominous model for the present\r\nproceedings, which took the form of a trial for high treason. In\r\nconducting this singular prosecution, it does not appear that any\r\ncounsel or evidence appeared on behalf of the prisoner, although a\r\nformidable amount of testimony, it would seem, was collected on the\r\nother side. But, in truth, we know little of the proceedings. There is\r\nno proof that any but the monarch, and the secret tribunal that presided\r\nover the trial,--if so it can be called,--ever saw the papers. In 1592,\r\naccording to the historian Cabrera, they were deposited, by Philip's\r\norders, in a green box, strongly secured, in the Archives of\r\nSimancas,[1470]--where, as we have no later information, they may still\r\nremain, to reward the labors of some future antiquary.[1471]\r\n\r\nIn default of these documents, we must resort to conjecture for the\r\nsolution of this difficult problem; and there are several circumstances\r\nwhich may assist us in arriving at a conclusion. Among the foreign\r\nministers at that time at the court of Madrid, none took more pains to\r\ncome at the truth of this affair,--as his letters abundantly\r\nprove,--than the papal nuncio, Castaneo, archbishop of Rossano. He was a\r\nshrewd, sagacious prelate, whose position and credit at the court gave\r\nhim the best opportunities for information. By Philip's command,\r\nCardinal Espinosa gave the nuncio the usual explanation of the grounds\r\non which Carlos had been arrested. \"It is a strange story,\" said the\r\nnuncio, \"that which we everywhere hear, of the prince's plot against his\r\nfather's life.\" \"It would be of little moment,\" replied the cardinal,\r\n\"if the danger to the king were all; as it would be easy to protect his\r\nperson. But the present case is worse,--if worse can be; and the king,\r\nwho has seen the bad course which his son has taken for these two years\r\npast, has vainly tried to remedy it; till, finding himself unable to\r\nexercise any control over the hair-brained young man, he has been forced\r\nto this expedient.\"[1472]\r\n\r\nNow, in the judgment of a grand-inquisitor, it would probably be thought\r\nthat heresy, or any leaning to heresy, was a crime of even a deeper dye\r\nthan parricide. The cardinal's discourse made this impression on the\r\nnuncio, who straightway began to cast about for proofs of apostasy in\r\nDon Carlos. The Tuscan minister also notices, in his letters, the\r\nsuspicions that Carlos was not a good Catholic.[1473] A confirmation of\r\nthis view of the matter may be gathered from the remarks of Pius the\r\nFifth on Philip's letter in cipher, above noticed. \"His holiness,\"\r\nwrites the Spanish ambassador, \"greatly lauds the course taken by your\r\nmajesty; for he feels that the preservation of Christianity depends on\r\nyour living many years, and on your having a successor who will tread in\r\nyour footsteps.\"[1474]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CAUSES OF HIS IMPRISONMENT.]\r\n\r\nBut though all this seems to intimate pretty clearly that the religious\r\ndefection of Carlos was a predominant motive for his imprisonment, it is\r\nnot easy to believe that a person of his wayward and volatile mind could\r\nhave formed any settled opinions in matters of faith, or that his\r\nposition would have allowed the Reformers such access to his person as\r\nto have greatly exposed him to the influence of their doctrines. Yet it\r\nis quite possible that he may have taken an interest in those political\r\nmovements abroad, which, in the end, were directed against the Church. I\r\nallude to the troubles in the Low Countries, which he is said to have\r\nlooked upon with no unfriendly eye. It is true, there is no proof of\r\nthis, so far as I am aware, in the correspondence of the Flemish\r\nleaders. Nor is there any reason to suppose that Carlos entered\r\ndirectly into a correspondence with them himself, or indeed committed\r\nhimself by any overt act in support of the cause.[1475] But this was not\r\nnecessary for his condemnation; it would have been quite enough, that he\r\nhad felt a sympathy for the distresses of the people. From the residence\r\nof Egmont, Bergen, and Montigny at the court, he had obvious means of\r\ncommunication with those nobles, who may naturally have sought to\r\ninterest him in behalf of their countrymen. The sympathy readily kindled\r\nin the ardent bosom of the young prince would be as readily expressed.\r\nThat he did feel such a sympathy may perhaps be inferred by his strange\r\nconduct to Alva, on the eve of his departure for the Netherlands. But\r\nthe people of that country were regarded at Madrid as in actual\r\nrebellion against the crown. The reformed doctrines which they avowed\r\ngave to the movement the character of a religious revolution. For a\r\nSpaniard to countenance it in any way was at once to prove himself false\r\nboth to his sovereign and his faith. In such a light, we may be quite\r\nsure, it would be viewed both by Philip and his minister, the\r\ngrand-inquisitor. Nor would it be thought any palliation of the crime,\r\nthat the offender was heir to the monarchy.[1476]\r\n\r\nAs to a design on his father's life, Philip, both in his foreign\r\ndespatches and in the communications made by his order to the resident\r\nministers at Madrid, wholly acquitted Carlos of so horrible a\r\ncharge.[1477] If it had any foundation in truth, one might suppose that\r\nPhilip, instead of denying, would have paraded it, as furnishing an\r\nobvious apology for subjecting him to so rigorous a confinement. It is\r\ncertain, if Carlos had really entertained so monstrous a design, he\r\nmight easily have found an opportunity to execute it. That Philip would\r\nhave been silent in respect to his son's sympathy with the Netherlands\r\nmay well be believed. The great champion of Catholicism would naturally\r\nshrink from publishing to the world that the taint of heresy infected\r\nhis own blood.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever may have been the motives which determined the conduct of\r\nPhilip, one cannot but suspect that a deep-rooted aversion to his son\r\nlay at the bottom of them. The dissimilarity of their natures placed the\r\ntwo parties, from the first, in false relations to each other. The\r\nheedless excesses of youth were regarded with a pitiless eye by the\r\nparent, who, in his own indulgences, at least did not throw aside the\r\nveil of decorum. The fiery temper of Carlos, irritated by a\r\nlong-continued system of distrust, exclusion, and _espionnage_, at\r\nlength broke out into such senseless extravagances as belong to the\r\ndebatable ground of insanity. And this ground afforded, as already\r\nintimated, a plausible footing to the father for proceeding to\r\nextremities against the son.\r\n\r\nWhatever were the offences of Carlos, those who had the best\r\nopportunities for observation soon became satisfied that it was intended\r\nnever to allow him to regain his liberty, or to ascend the throne of\r\nhis ancestors.[1478] On the second of March, a code of regulations was\r\nprepared by Philip relative to the treatment of the prince, which may\r\ngive some idea of the rigor of his confinement. He was given in especial\r\ncharge to Ruy Gomez, who was placed at the head of the establishment;\r\nand it was from him that every person employed about Carlos was to\r\nreceive his commission. Six other nobles were appointed both to guard\r\nthe prince and render him service. Two of the number were to remain in\r\nhis apartment every night,--the one watching, while the other slept;\r\nreminding us of an ingenious punishment among the Chinese, where a\r\ncriminal is obliged to be everywhere followed by an attendant, whose\r\nbusiness it is to keep an unceasing watch upon the offender, that,\r\nwherever he turns, he may still find the same eye riveted upon him!\r\n\r\nDuring the day, it was the duty of these nobles to remain with Carlos\r\nand lighten by their conversation the gloom of his captivity. But they\r\nwere not to talk on matters relating to the government, above all to the\r\nprince's imprisonment, on which topic, if he addressed them, they were\r\nto remain obdurately silent. They were to bring no messages to him, and\r\nbear none from him to the world without; and they were to maintain\r\ninviolable secrecy in regard to all that passed within the walls of the\r\npalace, unless when otherwise permitted by the king. Carlos was provided\r\nwith a breviary and some other books of devotion; and no works except\r\nthose of a devotional character were to be allowed him.[1479]--This last\r\nregulation seems to intimate the existence of certain heretical\r\ntendencies in Carlos, which it was necessary to counteract by books of\r\nan opposite character,--unless it might be considered as an ominous\r\npreparation for his approaching end. Besides the six nobles, no one was\r\nallowed to enter the apartment but the prince's physician, his\r\n_barbero_, or gentleman of the chamber, and his valet. The last was\r\ntaken from the _monteros_, or body-guard of the king.[1480] There were\r\nseven others of this faithful corps who were attached to the\r\nestablishment, and whose duty it was to bring the dishes for his table\r\nto an outer hall, whence they were taken by the _montero_ in waiting to\r\nthe prince's chamber. A guard of twelve halberdiers was also stationed\r\nin the passages leading to the apartment, to intercept all communication\r\nfrom without. Every person employed in the service, from the highest\r\nnoble to the meanest official, made solemn oath, before the prince of\r\nEboli, to conform to the regulations. On this nobleman rested the whole\r\nresponsibility of enforcing obedience to the rules, and of providing for\r\nthe security of Carlos. The better to effect this, he was commanded to\r\nremove to the palace, where apartments were assigned to him and the\r\nprincess his wife, adjoining those of his prisoner. The arrangement may\r\nhave been commended by other considerations to Philip, whose intimacy\r\nwith the princess I shall have occasion to notice hereafter.[1481]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS RIGOROUS CONFINEMENT.]\r\n\r\nThe regulations, severe as they were, were executed to the letter.\r\nPhilip's aunt, the queen of Portugal, wrote in earnest terms to the\r\nking, kindly offering herself to remain with her grandson in his\r\nconfinement, and take charge of him like a mother in his\r\naffliction.[1482] \"But they were very willing,\" writes the French\r\nminister, \"to spare her the trouble.\"[1483] The emperor and empress\r\nwrote to express the hope that the confinement of Carlos would work an\r\namendment in his conduct, and that he would soon be liberated. Several\r\nletters passed between the courts, until Philip closed the\r\ncorrespondence by declaring that his son's marriage with the princess\r\nAnne could never take place, and that he would never be liberated.[1484]\r\n\r\nPhilip's queen, Isabella, and his sister Joanna, who seem to have been\r\ndeeply afflicted by the course taken with the prince, made ineffectual\r\nattempts to be allowed to visit him in his confinement; and when Don\r\nJohn of Austria came to the palace dressed in a mourning suit, to\r\ntestify his grief on the occasion, Philip coldly rebuked his brother,\r\nand ordered him to change his mourning for his ordinary dress.[1485]\r\n\r\nSeveral of the great towns were prepared to send their delegates to\r\ncondole with the monarch under his affliction. But Philip gave them to\r\nunderstand, that he had only acted for the good of the nation, and that\r\ntheir condolence on the occasion would be superfluous.[1486] When the\r\ndeputies of Aragon, Catalonia, and Valencia were on their way to court,\r\nwith instructions to inquire into the cause of the prince's\r\nimprisonment, and to urge his speedy liberation, they received, on the\r\nway, so decided an intimation of the royal displeasure, that they\r\nthought it prudent to turn back, without venturing to enter the\r\ncapital.[1487]\r\n\r\nIn short, it soon came to be understood, that the affair of Don Carlos\r\nwas a subject not to be talked about. By degrees, it seemed to pass out\r\nof men's minds, like a thing of ordinary occurrence. \"There is as little\r\nsaid now on the subject of the prince,\" writes the French ambassador,\r\nFourquevaulx, \"as if he had been dead these ten years.\"[1488] His name,\r\nindeed, still kept its place, among those of the royal family, in the\r\nprayers said in the churches. But the king prohibited the clergy from\r\nalluding to Carlos in their discourses. Nor did any one venture, says\r\nthe same authority, to criticize the conduct of the king. \"So complete\r\nis the ascendancy which Philip's wisdom has given him over his subjects,\r\nthat, willing or unwilling, all promptly obey him: and if they do not\r\nlove him, they at least appear to do so.\"[1489]\r\n\r\nAmong the articles removed from the prince's chamber was a coffer, as\r\nthe reader may remember, containing his private papers. Among these were\r\na number of letters intended for distribution after his departure from\r\nthe country. One was addressed to his father, in which Carlos avowed\r\nthat the cause of his flight was the harsh treatment he had received\r\nfrom the king.[1490] Other letters, addressed to different nobles, and\r\nto some of the great towns, made a similar statement; and, after\r\nreminding them of the oath they had taken to him as successor to the\r\ncrown, he promised to grant them various immunities when the sceptre\r\nshould come into his hands.[1491] With these papers was also found one\r\nof most singular import. It contained a list of all those persons whom\r\nhe deemed friendly, or inimical to himself. At the head of the former\r\nclass stood the names of his step-mother, Isabella, and of his uncle Don\r\nJohn of Austria,--both of them noticed in terms of the warmest\r\naffection. On the catalogue of his enemies, \"to be pursued to the\r\ndeath,\" were the names of the king, his father, the prince and princess\r\nof Eboli, Cardinal Espinosa, the duke of Alva, and others.[1492]--Such\r\nis the strange account of the contents of the coffer given to his court\r\nby the papal nuncio. These papers, we are told, were submitted to the\r\njudges who conducted the process, and formed, doubtless, an important\r\npart of the testimony against the prince. It may have been from one of\r\nthe parties concerned that the nuncio gathered his information. Yet no\r\nmember of that tribunal would have ventured to disclose its secrets\r\nwithout authority from Philip; who may possibly have consented to the\r\npublication of facts that would serve to vindicate his course. If these\r\nfacts are faithfully reported, they must be allowed to furnish some\r\nevidence of a disordered mind in Carlos.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS EXCESSES.]\r\n\r\nThe king, meanwhile, was scarcely less a prisoner than his son; for,\r\nfrom the time of the prince's arrest, he had never left the palace, even\r\nto visit his favorite residences of Aranjuez and the Prado; nor had he\r\npassed a single day in the occupation, in which he took such delight, of\r\nwatching the rising glories of the Escorial. He seemed to be constantly\r\nhaunted by the apprehension of some outbreak among the people, or at\r\nleast among the partisans of Carlos, to effect his escape; and when he\r\nheard any unusual noise in the palace, says his historian, he would go\r\nto the window, to see if the tumult were not occasioned by an attempt\r\nto release the prisoner.[1493] There was little cause for apprehension\r\nin regard to a people so well disciplined to obedience as the Castilians\r\nunder Philip the Second. But it is an ominous circumstance for a\r\nprisoner, that he should become the occasion of such apprehension.\r\n\r\nPhilip, however, was not induced by his fears to mitigate in any degree\r\nthe rigor of his son's confinement, which produced the effect to have\r\nbeen expected on one of his fiery, ungovernable temper. At first he was\r\nthrown into a state bordering on frenzy, and, it is said, more than once\r\ntried to make away with himself. As he found that thus to beat against\r\nthe bars of his prison-house was only to add to his distresses, he\r\nresigned himself in sullen silence to his fate,--the sullenness of\r\ndespair. In his indifference to all around him, he ceased to take an\r\ninterest in his own spiritual concerns. Far from using the religious\r\nbooks in his possession, he would attend to no act of devotion, refusing\r\neven to confess, or to admit his confessor into his presence.[1494]\r\nThese signs of fatal indifference, if not of positive defection from the\r\nFaith, gave great alarm to Philip, who would not willingly see the soul\r\nthus perish with the body.[1495] In this emergency he employed Suarez,\r\nthe prince's almoner, who once had some influence over his master, to\r\naddress him a letter of expostulation. The letter has been preserved,\r\nand is too remarkable to be passed by in silence.\r\n\r\nSuarez begins with reminding Carlos that his rash conduct had left him\r\nwithout partisans or friends. The effect of his present course, instead\r\nof mending his condition, could only serve to make it worse. \"What will\r\nthe world say,\" continues the ecclesiastic, \"when it shall learn that\r\nyou now refuse to confess; when, too, it shall discover other dreadful\r\nthings of which you have been guilty, some of which are of such a\r\nnature, that, did they concern any other than your highness, _the Holy\r\nOffice would be led to inquire whether the author of them were in truth\r\na Christian_?[1496] It is in the bitterness and anguish of my heart that\r\nI must declare to your highness, that you are not only in danger of\r\nforfeiting your worldly estate, but, what is worse, your own soul.\" And\r\nhe concludes by imploring Carlos, as the only remedy, to return to his\r\nobedience to God, and to the king, who is his representative on earth.\r\n\r\nBut the admonitions of the honest almoner had as little effect on the\r\nunhappy youth as the prayers of his attendants. The mental excitement\r\nunder which he labored, combined with the want of air and exercise,\r\nproduced its natural effect on his health. Every day he became more and\r\nmore emaciated; while the fever which had so long preyed on his\r\nconstitution now burned in his veins with greater fury than ever. To\r\nallay the intolerable heat, he resorted to such desperate expedients as\r\nseemed to intimate, says the papal nuncio, that, if debarred from laying\r\nviolent hands on himself, he would accomplish the same end in a slower\r\nway, but not less sure. He deluged the floor with water, not a little to\r\nthe inconvenience of the companions of his prison, and walked about for\r\nhours, half naked, with bare feet, on the cold pavement.[1497] He caused\r\na warming-pan filled with ice and snow to be introduced several times in\r\na night into his bed, and let it remain there for hours together.[1498]\r\nAs if this were not enough, he would gulp down such draughts of\r\nsnow-water as distance any achievement on record in the annals of\r\nhydropathy. He pursued the same mad course in respect to what he ate. He\r\nwould abstain from food an incredible number of days,[1499] and then,\r\nindulging in proportion to his former abstinence, would devour a pastry\r\nof four partridges, with all the paste, at a sitting, washing it down\r\nwith three gallons or more of iced water![1500]\r\n\r\nNo constitution could long withstand such violent assaults as these. The\r\nconstitution of Carlos gradually sank under them. His stomach,\r\ndebilitated by long inaction, refused to perform the extraordinary tasks\r\nthat were imposed on it. He was attacked by incessant vomiting;\r\ndysentery set in; and his strength rapidly failed. The physician,\r\nOlivares, who alone saw the patient, consulted with his brethren in the\r\napartments of Ruy Gomez.[1501] Their remedies failed to restore the\r\nexhausted energies of nature; and it was soon evident that the days of\r\nCharles were numbered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS LAST MOMENTS.]\r\n\r\nTo no one could such an announcement have given less concern than to\r\nCarlos; for he had impatiently looked to death as to his release. From\r\nthis hour he seemed to discard all earthly troubles from his mind, as he\r\nfixed his thoughts steadfastly on the future. At his own request his\r\nconfessor, Chavres and Suarez, his almoner, were summoned, and assisted\r\nhim with their spiritual consolations. The closing scenes are recorded\r\nby the pen of the nuncio.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly a wonderful change seemed to be wrought by divine grace in the\r\nheart of the prince. Instead of vain and empty talk, his language became\r\nthat of a sensible man. He sent for his confessor, devoutly confessed,\r\nand, as his illness was such that he could not receive the host, he\r\nhumbly adored it; showing throughout great contrition, and, though not\r\nrefusing the proffered remedies, manifesting such contempt for the\r\nthings of this world, and such a longing for heaven, that one would have\r\nsaid, God had reserved for this hour the sum of all his grace.\"[1502]\r\n\r\nHe seemed to feel an assurance that he was to survive till the vigil of\r\nSt. James, the patron saint of his country. When told that this would be\r\nfour days later, he said, \"So long will my misery endure.\"[1503] He\r\nwould willingly have seen his father once more before his death. But his\r\nconfessor, it is said, dissuaded the monarch, on the ground that Carlos\r\nwas now in so happy a frame of mind, that it were better not to disturb\r\nit by drawing off his attention to worldly objects. Philip, however,\r\ntook the occasion, when Carlos lay asleep or insensible, to enter the\r\nchamber; and, stealing softly behind the prince of Eboli and the\r\ngrand-prior, Antonio de Toledo, he stretched out his hand towards the\r\nbed, and, making the sign of the cross, gave the parting benediction to\r\nhis dying son.[1504]\r\n\r\nNor was Carlos allowed the society of his amiable step-mother, the\r\nqueen, nor of his aunt Joanna, to sweeten by their kind attentions the\r\nbitterness of death.[1505] It was his sad fate to die, as he had lived\r\nthroughout his confinement, under the cold gaze of his enemies. Yet he\r\ndied at peace with all; and some of the last words that he uttered were\r\nto forgive his father for his imprisonment, and the ministers--naming\r\nRuy Gomez and Espinosa in particular--who advised him to it.[1506]\r\n\r\nCarlos now grew rapidly more feeble, having scarce strength enough left\r\nto listen to the exhortations of his confessor, and with low, indistinct\r\nmurmurings to adore the crucifix which he held constantly in his hand.\r\nOn the twenty-fourth of July, soon after midnight, he was told it was\r\nthe Vigil of St. James. Then suddenly rousing, with a gleam of joy on\r\nhis countenance, he intimated his desire for his confessor to place the\r\nholy taper in his hand: and feebly beating his breast, as if to invoke\r\nthe mercy of Heaven on his transgressions, he fell back, and expired\r\nwithout a groan.[1507]--\"No Catholic,\" says Nobili, \"ever made a more\r\nCatholic end.\"[1508]\r\n\r\nSuch is the account given us of the last hours of this most unfortunate\r\nprince, by the papal nuncio and the Tuscan minister, and repeated with\r\nslight discrepancies by most of the Castilian writers of that and the\r\nfollowing age.[1509] It is a singular circumstance, that, although we\r\nhave such full reports, both of what preceded and what followed the\r\ndeath of Carlos, from the French ambassador, the portion of his\r\ncorrespondence, which embraces his death has been withdrawn, whether by\r\naccident or design, from the archives.[1510] But probably no one without\r\nthe walls of the palace had access to better sources of information than\r\nthe two ministers first mentioned, especially the papal nuncio. Their\r\nintelligence may well have been derived from some who had been about the\r\nperson of Carlos. If so, it could not have been communicated without the\r\napprobation of Philip, who may have been willing that the world should\r\nunderstand that his son had died true to the Faith.\r\n\r\nA very different account of the end of Carlos is given by Llorente. And\r\nas this writer, the secretary of the Inquisition, had access to very\r\nimportant materials; and as his account, though somewhat prolix, is\r\naltogether remarkable, I cannot pass it by in silence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LLORENTE'S ACCOUNT.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Llorente, the process already noticed as having been\r\ninstituted against Carlos was brought to a close only a short time\r\nbefore his death. No notice of it, during all this time, had been given\r\nto the prisoner, and no counsel was employed in his behalf. By the ninth\r\nof July the affair was sufficiently advanced for a \"summary judgment.\"\r\nIt resulted from the evidence, that the accused was guilty of treason in\r\nboth the first and second degree,--as having endeavored to compass the\r\ndeath of the king, his father, and as having conspired to usurp the\r\nsovereignty of Flanders. The counsellor Muñatones, in his report, which\r\nhe laid before the king, while he stated that the penalty imposed by the\r\nlaw on every other subject for these crimes was death, added, that his\r\nmajesty, by his sovereign authority, might decide that the heir apparent\r\nwas placed by his rank above the reach of ordinary laws. And it was\r\nfurther in his power to mitigate or dispense with any penalty whatever,\r\nwhen he considered it for the good of his subjects.--In this judgment\r\nboth the ministers, Ruy Gomez and Espinosa, declared their concurrence.\r\n\r\nTo this the king replied, that, though his feelings moved him to follow\r\nthe suggestions of his ministers, his conscience would not permit it. He\r\ncould not think that he should consult the good of his people by placing\r\nover them a monarch so vicious in his disposition, and so fierce and\r\nsanguinary in his temper, as Carlos. However agonizing it might be to\r\nhis feelings as a father, he must allow the law to take its course. Yet,\r\nafter all, he said, it might not be necessary to proceed to this\r\nextremity. The prince's health was in so critical a state, that it was\r\nonly necessary to relax the precautions in regard to his diet, and his\r\nexcesses would soon conduct him to the tomb! One point only was\r\nessential, that he should be so well advised of his situation that he\r\nshould be willing to confess, and make his peace with Heaven before he\r\ndied. This was the greatest proof of love which he could give to his son\r\nand to the Spanish nation.\r\n\r\nRuy Gomez and Espinosa both of them inferred from this singular\r\nebullition of parental tenderness, that they could not further the real\r\nintentions of the king better than by expediting as much as possible the\r\ndeath of Carlos. Ruy Gomez accordingly communicated his views to\r\nOlivares, the prince's physician. This he did in such ambiguous and\r\nmysterious phrase as, while it intimated his meaning, might serve to\r\nveil the enormity of the crime from the eyes of the party who was to\r\nperpetrate it. No man was more competent to this delicate task than the\r\nprince of Eboli, bred from his youth in courts, and trained to a life of\r\ndissimulation. Olivares readily comprehended the drift of his\r\ndiscourse,--that the thing required of him was to dispose of the\r\nprisoner, in such a way that his death should appear natural, and that\r\nthe honor of the king should not be compromised. He raised no scruples,\r\nbut readily signified his willingness faithfully to execute the will of\r\nhis sovereign. Under these circumstances, on the twentieth of July, a\r\npurgative dose was administered to the unsuspecting patient, who, as may\r\nbe imagined, rapidly grew worse. It was a consolation to his father,\r\nthat, when advised of his danger, Carlos consented to receive his\r\nconfessor. Thus, though the body perished, the soul was saved.[1511]\r\n\r\nSuch is the extraordinary account given us by Llorente, which, if true,\r\nwould at once settle the question in regard to the death of Carlos. But\r\nLlorente, with a disingenuousness altogether unworthy of an historian in\r\na matter of so grave import, has given us no knowledge of the sources\r\nwhence his information was derived. He simply says, that they are\r\n\"certain secret memoirs of the time, full of curious anecdote, which,\r\nthough not possessing precisely the character of authenticity, are\r\nnevertheless entitled to credit, as coming from persons employed in the\r\npalace of the king!\"[1512] Had the writer condescended to acquaint us\r\nwith the names, or some particulars of the characters, of his authors,\r\nwe might have been able to form some estimate of the value of their\r\ntestimony. His omission to do this may lead us to infer, that he had not\r\nperfect confidence in it himself. At all events it compels us to trust\r\nthe matter entirely to his own discretion, a virtue which those familiar\r\nwith his inaccuracies in other matters will not be disposed to concede\r\nto him in a very eminent degree.[1513]\r\n\r\nHis narrative, moreover, is in direct contradiction to the authorities I\r\nhave already noticed, especially to the two foreign ministers so often\r\nquoted, who, with the advantages--not a few--that they possessed for\r\nobtaining correct information, were indefatigable in collecting it. \"I\r\nsay nothing,\" writes the Tuscan envoy, alluding, to the idle rumors of\r\nthe town, \"of gossip unworthy to be listened to. It is a hard thing to\r\nsatisfy the populace. It is best to stick to the truth, without caring\r\nfor the opinion of those who talk wildly of improbable matters, which\r\nhave their origin in ignorance and malice.\"[1514]\r\n\r\nStill, it cannot be denied, that suspicions of foul play to Carlos were\r\nnot only current abroad, but were entertained by persons of higher rank\r\nthan the populace at home,--where it could not be safe to utter them.\r\nAmong others, the celebrated Antonio Perez, one of the household of the\r\nprince of Eboli, informs us, that, \"as the king had found Carlos guilty,\r\nhe was condemned to death by casuists and inquisitors. But in order that\r\nthe execution of this sentence might not be brought too palpably before\r\nthe public, they mixed for four months together a slow poison in his\r\nfood.\"[1515]\r\n\r\nThis statement agrees, to a certain extent, with that of a noble\r\nVenetian, Pietro Giustiniani, then in Castile, who assured the historian\r\nDe Thou, that \"Philip having determined on the death of his son,\r\nobtained a sentence to that effect from a lawful judge. But in order to\r\nsave the honor of the sovereign, the sentence was executed in secret,\r\nand Carlos was made to swallow some poisoned broth, of which he died\r\nsome hours afterwards.\"[1516]\r\n\r\nSome of the particulars mentioned by Antonio Perez may be thought to\r\nreceive confirmation from an account given by the French minister,\r\nFourquevaulx, in a letter dated about a month after the prince's arrest.\r\n\"The prince,\" he says, \"becomes visibly thinner and more dried up; and\r\nhis eyes are sunk in his head. They give him sometimes strong soups and\r\ncapon broths, in which amber and other nourishing things are dissolved,\r\nthat he may not wholly lose his strength and fall into decrepitude.\r\nThese soups are prepared privately in the chamber of Ruy Gomez, through\r\nwhich one passes into that of the prince.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VARIOUS ACCOUNTS.]\r\n\r\nIt was not to be expected that a Castilian writer should have the\r\ntemerity to assert that the death of Carlos was brought about by\r\nviolence. Yet Cabrera, the best informed historian of the period, who,\r\nin his boyhood, had frequent access to the house of Ruy Gomez, and even\r\nto the royal palace, while he describes the excesses of Carlos as the\r\ncause of his untimely end, makes some mysterious intimations, which,\r\nwithout any forced construction, seem to point to the agency of others\r\nin bringing about that event.[1517]\r\n\r\nStrada, the best informed, on the whole, of the foreign writers of the\r\nperiod, and who, as a foreigner, had not the same motives for silence as\r\na Spaniard, qualifies his account of the prince's death as having taken\r\nplace in the natural-way, by saying, \"if indeed he did not perish by\r\nviolence.\"[1518]--The prince of Orange, in his bold denunciation of\r\nPhilip, does not hesitate to proclaim him the murderer of his son.[1519]\r\nAnd that inquisitive gossip-monger, Brantôme, amidst the bitter jests\r\nand epigrams which, he tells us, his countrymen levelled at Philip for\r\nhis part in this transaction, quotes the authority of a Spaniard of rank\r\nfor the assertion that, after Carlos had been condemned by his\r\nfather,--in opposition to the voice of his council,--the prince was\r\nfound dead in his chamber, smothered with a towel![1520] Indeed, the\r\nvarious modes of death assigned to him are sufficient evidence of the\r\nuncertainty as to any one of them.[1521] A writer of more recent date\r\ndoes not scruple to assert, that the only liberty granted to Carlos was\r\nthat of selecting the manner of his death out of several kinds that were\r\nproposed to him;[1522]--an incident which has since found a more\r\nsuitable place in one of the many dramas that have sprang from his\r\nmysterious story.\r\n\r\nIn all this the historian must admit there is but little evidence of\r\npositive value. The authors--with the exception of Antonio Perez, who\r\nhad his account, he tells us, from the prince of Eboli--are by no means\r\nlikely to have had access to sure sources of information; while their\r\nstatements are contradictory to one another, and stand in direct\r\nopposition to those of the Tuscan minister and of the nuncio, the latter\r\nof whom had, probably, better knowledge of what was passing in the\r\ncouncils of the monarch, than any other of the diplomatic body. Even the\r\ndeclaration of Antonio Perez, so important on many accounts, is to a\r\nconsiderable degree neutralized by the fact, that he was the mortal\r\nenemy of Philip, writing in exile, with a price set upon his head by the\r\nman whose character he was assailing. It is the hard fate of a person so\r\nsituated, that even truth from his lips fails to carry with it\r\nconviction.[1523]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES.]\r\n\r\nIf we reject his explanation of the matter, we shall find ourselves\r\nagain thrown on the sea of conjecture, and may be led to account for the\r\nrumors of violence on the part of Philip by the mystery in which the\r\nwhole of the proceedings was involved, and the popular notion of the\r\ncharacter of the monarch who directed them. The same suspicious\r\ncircumstances must have their influence on the historian of the present\r\nday, as with insufficient, though more ample light than was enjoyed by\r\ncontemporaries, he painfully endeavors to grope his way through this\r\nobscure passage in the life of Philip. Many reflections of ominous\r\nimport naturally press upon his mind. From the first hour of the\r\nprince's confinement it was determined, as we have seen, that he was\r\nnever to be released from it. Yet the preparations for keeping him a\r\nprisoner were on so extraordinary a scale, and imposed such a burden on\r\nmen of the highest rank in the kingdom, as seemed to argue that his\r\nconfinement was not to be long. It is a common saying,--as old as\r\nMachiavelli,--that to a deposed prince the distance is not great from\r\nthe throne to the grave. Carlos, indeed, had never worn a crown. But\r\nthere seemed to be the same reasons as if he had, for abridging the term\r\nof his imprisonment. All around the prince regarded him with distrust.\r\nThe king, his father, appeared to live, as we have seen, in greater\r\napprehension of him after his confinement, than before.[1524] \"The\r\nministers, whom Carlos hated,\" says the nuncio, \"knew well that it would\r\nbe their ruin, should he ever ascend the throne.\"[1525] Thus, while the\r\nfears and the interests of all seemed to tend to his removal, we find\r\nnothing in the character of Philip to counteract the tendency. For when\r\nwas he ever known to relax his grasp on the victim once within his\r\npower, or to betray any feeling of compunction as to sweeping away an\r\nobstacle from his path? One has only to call to mind the long\r\nconfinement, ending with the midnight execution, of Montigny, the open\r\nassassination of the prince of Orange, the secret assassination of the\r\nsecretary Escovedo, the unrelenting persecution of Perez, his agent in\r\nthat murder, and his repeated attempts to despatch him also by the hand\r\nof the bravo. These are passages in the history of Philip which yet\r\nremain to be presented to the reader, and the knowledge of which is\r\nnecessary before we can penetrate into the depths of his dark and\r\nunscrupulous character.\r\n\r\nIf it be thought that there is a wide difference between these deeds of\r\nviolence and the murder of a son, we must remember that, in affairs of\r\nreligion, Philip acted avowedly on the principle, that the end justifies\r\nthe means; that one of the crimes charged upon Carlos was defection from\r\nthe Faith; and that Philip had once replied to the piteous appeal of a\r\nheretic whom they were dragging to the stake, \"Were my son such a wretch\r\nas thou art, I would myself carry the fagots to burn him!\"[1526]\r\n\r\nBut in whatever light we are to regard the death of Carlos,--whether as\r\ncaused by violence, or by those insane excesses in which he was allowed\r\nto plunge during his confinement,--in either event the responsibility,\r\nto a great extent, must be allowed to rest on Philip, who, if he did not\r\ndirectly employ the hand of the assassin to take the life of his son,\r\nyet by his rigorous treatment drove that son to a state of desperation\r\nthat brought about the same fatal result.[1527]\r\n\r\nWhile the prince lay in the agonies of death, scarcely an hour before he\r\nbreathed his last, a scene of a very different nature was passing in an\r\nadjoining gallery of the palace. A quarrel arose there between two\r\ncourtiers,--one of them a young cavalier, Don Antonio de Leyva, the\r\nother Don Diego de Mendoza, a nobleman who had formerly filled, with\r\ngreat distinction, the post of ambassador at Rome. The dispute arose\r\nrespecting some _coplas_, of which Mendoza claimed to be the author.\r\nThough at this time near sixty years old, the fiery temperament of youth\r\nhad not been cooled by age. Enraged at what he conceived an insult on\r\nthe part of his companion, he drew his dagger. The other as promptly\r\nunsheathed his sword. Thrusts were exchanged between the parties; and\r\nthe noise of the fracas at length reached the ears of Philip himself.\r\nIndignant at the outrage thus perpetrated within the walls of the\r\npalace, and at such an hour, he ordered his guards instantly to arrest\r\nthe offenders. But the combatants, brought to their senses, had\r\nsucceeded in making their escape, and taken refuge in a neighboring\r\nchurch. Philip was too much incensed to respect this asylum; and an\r\nalcalde, by his command, entered the church at midnight, and dragged the\r\noffenders from the sanctuary. Leyva was put in irons, and lodged in the\r\nfortress of Madrid; while his rival was sent to the tower of Simancas.\r\n\"It is thought they will pay for this outrage with their lives,\" writes\r\nthe Tuscan minister, Nobili. \"The king,\" he adds, \"has even a mind to\r\ncashier his guard for allowing them to escape.\" Philip, however,\r\nconfined the punishment of the nobles to banishment from court; and the\r\nold courtier, Mendoza, profited by his exile to give to the world those\r\nremarkable compositions, both in history and romance, that form an epoch\r\nin the national literature.[1528]\r\n\r\nA few days before his death, Carlos is said to have made a will, in\r\nwhich, after imploring his father's pardon and blessing, he commended\r\nhis servants to his care, gave away a few jewels to two or three\r\nfriends, and disposed of the rest of his property in behalf of sundry\r\nchurches and monasteries.[1529] Agreeably to his wish, his body was\r\nwrapped in a Franciscan robe, and was soon afterward laid in a coffin\r\ncovered with black velvet and rich brocade. At seven o'clock, that same\r\nevening, the remains of Carlos were borne from the chamber where he\r\ndied, to their place of interment.[1530]\r\n\r\nThe coffin was supported on the shoulders of the prince of Eboli, the\r\ndukes of Infantado and Bio Seco, and other principal grandees. In the\r\ncourt-yard of the palace was a large gathering of the members of the\r\nreligious fraternities, dignitaries of the church, foreign ambassadors,\r\nnobles and cavaliers about the court, and officers of the royal\r\nhousehold. There were there also the late attendants of Carlos,--to some\r\nof whom he had borne little love,--who, after watching him through his\r\ncaptivity, were now come to conduct him to his final resting-place.\r\nBefore moving, some wrangling took place among the parties on the\r\nquestion of precedence. Such a spirit might well have been rebuked by\r\nthe solemn character of the business they were engaged in, which might\r\nhave reminded them, that in the grave, at least, there are no\r\ndistinctions. But the perilous question was happily settled by Philip\r\nhimself, who, from an open window of the palace, looked down on the\r\nscene, and, with his usual composure, gave directions for forming the\r\nprocession.[1531]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS OBSEQUIES.]\r\n\r\nThe king did not accompany it. Slowly it defiled through the crowded\r\nstreets, where the people gave audible utterance to their grief, as they\r\ngazed on the funeral pomp, and their eyes fell on the bier of the\r\nprince, who, they had fondly hoped, would one day sway the sceptre of\r\nCastile; and whose errors, great as they were, were all forgotten in his\r\nunparalleled misfortunes.[1532]\r\n\r\nThe procession moved forward to the convent of San Domingo Real, where\r\nCarlos had desired that his ashes might be laid. The burial service was\r\nthere performed, with great solemnity, in presence of the vast\r\nmultitude. But whether it was that Philip distrusted the prudence of the\r\npreachers, or feared some audacious criticism on his conduct, no\r\ndiscourse was allowed to be delivered from the pulpit. For nine days\r\nreligious services were performed in honor of the deceased; and the\r\noffice for the dead continued to be read, morning and evening, before an\r\naudience among whom were the great nobles and the officers of state,\r\nclad in full mourning. The queen and the princess Joanna might be seen,\r\non these occasions, mingling their tears with the few who cherished the\r\nmemory of Carlos. A niche was excavated in the wall of the church,\r\nwithin the choir, in which the prince's remains were deposited. But they\r\ndid not rest there long. In 1573, they were removed, by Philip's orders,\r\nto the Escorial; and in its gloomy chambers they were left to mingle\r\nwith the kindred dust of the royal line of Austria.[1533]\r\n\r\nPhilip wrote to Zuñiga, his ambassador in Rome, to intimate his wish\r\nthat no funeral honors should be paid there to the memory of Carlos,\r\nthat no mourning should be worn, and that his holiness would not feel\r\nunder the necessity of sending him letters of condolence.[1534] Zuñiga\r\ndid his best. But he could not prevent the obsequies from being\r\ncelebrated with the lugubrious pomp suited to the rank of the departed.\r\nA catafalque was raised in the church of Saint James; the services were\r\nperformed in presence of the ambassador and his attendants, who were\r\ndressed in the deepest black; and twenty-one cardinals, one of whom was\r\nGranvelle, assisted at the solemn ceremonies.[1535] But no funeral\r\npanegyric was pronounced, and no monumental inscription recorded the\r\nimaginary virtues of the deceased.[1536]\r\n\r\nSoon after the prince's death, Philip retired to the monastery of St.\r\nJerome, in whose cloistered recesses he remained some time longer\r\nsecreted from the eyes of his subjects. \"He feels his loss like a\r\nfather,\" writes the papal nuncio, \"but he bears it with the patience of\r\na Christian.\"[1537] He caused despatches to be sent to foreign courts,\r\nto acquaint them with his late bereavement. In his letter to the duke\r\nof Alva, he indulges in a fuller expression of his personal feelings.\r\n\"You may conceive,\" he says, \"in what pain and heaviness I find myself,\r\nnow that it has pleased God to take my dear son, the prince, to himself.\r\nHe died in a Christian manner, after having, three days before, received\r\nthe sacrament, and exhibited repentance and contrition,--all which\r\nserves to console me under this affliction. For I hope that God has\r\ncalled him to himself, that he may be with him evermore; and that he\r\nwill grant me his grace, that I may endure this calamity with a\r\nChristian heart and patience.\"[1538]\r\n\r\nThus, in the morning of life, at little more than twenty-three years of\r\nage, perished Carlos, prince of Asturias. No one of his time came into\r\nthe world under so brilliant auspices; for he was heir to the noblest\r\nempire in Christendom; and the Spaniards, as they discerned in his\r\nchildhood some of the germs of future greatness in his character, looked\r\nconfidently forward to the day when he should rival the glory of his\r\ngrandfather, Charles the Fifth. But he was born under an evil star,\r\nwhich counteracted all the gifts of fortune, and turned them into a\r\ncurse. His naturally wild and headstrong temper was exasperated by\r\ndisease; and, when encountered by the distrust and alienation of him who\r\nhad the control of his destiny, was exalted into a state of frenzy, that\r\nfurnishes the best apology for his extravagances, and vindicates the\r\nnecessity of some measures, on the part of his father, to restrain them.\r\nYet can those who reject the imputation of murder acquit that father of\r\ninexorable rigor towards his child in the measures which he employed, or\r\nof the dreadful responsibility which attaches to the consequences of\r\nthem?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF ISABELLA.\r\n\r\nQueen Isabella.--Her Relations with Carlos.--Her Illness and Death.--Her\r\nCharacter.\r\n\r\n1568.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree months had not elapsed after the young and beautiful queen of\r\nPhilip the Second had wept over the fate of her unfortunate step-son,\r\nwhen she was herself called upon to follow him to the tomb. The\r\noccurrence of these sad events so near together, and the relations of\r\nthe parties, who had once been designed for each other, suggested the\r\nidea that a criminal passion subsisted between them, and that, after her\r\nlover's death, Isabella was herself sacrificed to the jealousy of a\r\nvindictive husband.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HER RELATIONS WITH CARLOS.]\r\n\r\nOne will in vain look for this tale of horror in the native historians\r\nof Castile. Nor does any historian of that day, native or foreign, whom\r\nI have consulted, in noticing the rumors of the time, cast a reproach on\r\nthe fair fame of Isabella; though more than one must be allowed to\r\nintimate the existence of the prince's passion for his\r\nstep-mother.[1539] Brantôme tells us that, when Carlos first saw the\r\nqueen, \"he was so captivated by her charms, that he conceived from that\r\ntime, a mortal spite against his father, whom he often reproached for\r\nthe great wrong he had done him, in ravishing from him this fair prize.\"\r\n\"And this,\" adds the writer, \"was said in part to have been the cause of\r\nthe prince's death; for he could not help loving the queen at the bottom\r\nof his soul, as well as honoring and reverencing one who was so truly\r\namiable and deserving of love.\"[1540] He afterwards gives us to\r\nunderstand that many rumors were afloat in regard to the manner of the\r\nqueen's death; and tells a story, not very probable, of a Jesuit, who\r\nwas banished to the farthest Indies, for denouncing, in his pulpit, the\r\nwickedness of those who could destroy so innocent a creature.[1541]\r\n\r\nA graver authority, the prince of Orange, in his public vindication of\r\nhis own conduct, openly charges Philip with the murder of both his son\r\nand his wife. It is to be noticed, however, that he nowhere intimates\r\nthat either of the parties was in love with the other; and he refers the\r\nqueen's death to Philip's desire to open the way to a marriage with the\r\nPrincess Anne of Austria.[1542] Yet these two authorities are the only\r\nones of that day, so far as I am aware, who have given countenance to\r\nthese startling rumors. Both were foreigners, far removed from the scene\r\nof action; one of them a light, garrulous Frenchman, whose amusing\r\npages, teeming with the idle gossip of the court, are often little\r\nbetter than a _Chronique Scandaleuse_; the other, the mortal enemy of\r\nPhilip, whose character--as the best means of defending his own--he was\r\nassailing with the darkest imputations.\r\n\r\nNo authority, however, beyond that of vulgar rumor, was required by the\r\nunscrupulous writers of a later time, who discerned the capabilities of\r\na story like that of Carlos and Isabella, in the situations of romantic\r\ninterest which it would open to the reader. Improving on this hint, they\r\nhave filled in the outlines of the picture with the touches of their own\r\nfancy; until the interest thus given to this tale of love and woe has\r\nmade it as widely known as any of the classic myths of early Grecian\r\nhistory.[1543]\r\n\r\nFortunately, we have the power, in this case, of establishing the truth\r\nfrom unsuspicious evidence,--that of Isabella's own countrymen, whose\r\nresidence at the court of Madrid furnished them with ample means of\r\npersonal observation. Isabella's mother, the famous Catherine de\r\nMedicis, associated with so much that is terrible in our imaginations,\r\nhad at least the merit of watching over her daughter's interests with\r\nthe most affectionate solicitude. This did not diminish when, at the age\r\nof fifteen, Elizabeth of France left her own land and ascended the\r\nthrone of Spain. Catherine kept up a constant correspondence with her\r\ndaughter, sometimes sending her instructions as to her conduct, at other\r\ntimes, medical prescriptions in regard to her health. She was careful\r\nalso to obtain information respecting Isabella's mode of life from the\r\nFrench ambassadors at the court of Castile; and we may be quite sure\r\nthat these loyal subjects would have been quick to report any injurious\r\ntreatment of the queen by her husband.\r\n\r\nA candid perusal of their despatches dispels all mystery,--or rather,\r\nproves there never was any cause for mystery. The sallow, sickly boy of\r\nfourteen--for Carlos was no older at the time of Isabella's\r\nmarriage--was possessed of too few personal attractions to make it\r\nprobable that he could have touched the heart of his beautiful\r\nstep-mother, had she been lightly disposed. But her intercourse with him\r\nfrom the first seems to have been such as naturally arose from the\r\nrelations of the parties, and from the kindness of her disposition,\r\nwhich led her to feel a sympathy for the personal infirmities and\r\nmisfortunes of Carlos. Far from attempting to disguise her feelings in\r\nthis matter, she displayed them openly in her correspondence with her\r\nmother, and before her husband and the world.\r\n\r\nSoon after Isabella's arrival at Madrid, we find a letter from the\r\nbishop of Limoges to Charles the Ninth, her brother, informing him that\r\n\"his sister, on entering the palace of Madrid, gave the prince so\r\ngracious and affectionate a reception, that it afforded singular\r\ncontentment to the king, and yet more to Carlos, as appeared by his\r\nfrequent visits to the queen,--as frequent as the etiquette of a court,\r\nmuch stiffer than that of Paris, would permit.\"[1544] Again, writing in\r\nthe following month, the bishop speaks of the queen as endeavoring to\r\namuse Carlos, when he came to see her in the evening, with such innocent\r\ngames and pastimes as might cheer the spirits of the young prince, who\r\nseemed to be wasting away under his malady.[1545]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HER RELATIONS WITH CARLOS.]\r\n\r\nThe next year we have a letter to Catherine de Medicis from one of\r\nIsabella's train, who had accompanied her from France. After speaking of\r\nher mistress as sometimes supping in the garden with the Princess\r\nJoanna, she says they were often joined there by \"the prince, who loves\r\nthe queen singularly well, and, as I suspect, would have no objection to\r\nbe more nearly related to her.\"[1546]--There is nothing improbable in\r\nthe supposition that Carlos, grateful for kindness to which he had not\r\nbeen too much accustomed, should, as he grew older, have yielded to the\r\ninfluence of a princess whose sweet disposition and engaging manners\r\nseem to have won the hearts of all who approached her; or that feelings\r\nof resentment should have mingled with his regret, as he thought of the\r\nhard fate which had placed a barrier between them. It is impossible,\r\ntoo, when we consider the prince's impetuous temper, that the French\r\nhistorian, De Thou, may have had good authority for asserting that\r\nCarlos, \"after long conversation in the queen's apartment, was often\r\nheard, as he came out, to complain loudly of his father's having robbed\r\nhim of her.\"[1547] But it could have been no vulgar passion that he felt\r\nfor Isabella, and certainly it received no encouragement from her, if,\r\nas Brantôme tells us, \"insolent and audacious as he was in his\r\nintercourse with all other women, he never came into the presence of his\r\nstep-mother without such a feeling of reverence as seemed to change his\r\nvery nature.\"\r\n\r\nNor is there the least evidence that the admiration excited by the\r\nqueen, whether in Carlos or in the courtiers, gave any uneasiness to\r\nPhilip, who seems to have reposed entire confidence in her discretion.\r\nAnd while we find Isabella speaking of Philip to her mother as \"so good\r\na husband, and rendering her so happy by his attentions, that it made\r\nthe dullest spot in the world agreeable to her,\"[1548] we meet with a\r\nletter from the French minister, Guibert, saying that \"the king goes on\r\nloving the queen more and more, and that her influence has increased\r\nthreefold within the last few months.\"[1549] A few years later, in 1565,\r\nSt. Sulpice, then ambassador in Madrid, writes to the queen-mother in\r\nemphatic terms of the affectionate intercourse that subsisted between\r\nPhilip and his consort. \"I can assure you, madam,\" he says, \"that the\r\nqueen, your daughter, lives in the greatest content in the world, by\r\nreason of the perfect friendship which ever draws her more closely to\r\nher husband. He shows her the most unreserved confidence, and is so\r\ncordial in his treatment of her as to leave nothing to be\r\ndesired.\"[1550] The writer quotes a declaration made to him by Philip,\r\nthat \"the loss of his consort would be a heavier misfortune than had\r\never yet befallen him.\"[1551]\r\n\r\nNor was this an empty profession in the king, as he evinced by his\r\nindulgence of Isabella's tastes,--even those national tastes which were\r\nnot always in accordance with the more rigid rules of Castilian\r\netiquette. To show the freedom with which she lived, I may perhaps be\r\nexcused for touching on a few particulars, already noticed in a previous\r\nchapter. On her coming into the country, she was greeted with balls and\r\nother festivities, to which she had been accustomed in the gay capital\r\nof France. Her domestic establishment was on a scale of magnificence\r\nsuited to her station; and the old courtier, Brantôme, dwells with\r\ndelight on the splendid profusion of her wardrobe, and the costly jewels\r\nwith which it was adorned. When she went abroad, she dispensed with her\r\nveil, after the fashion of her own country, though so much at variance\r\nwith the habits of the Spanish ladies. Yet it made her a greater\r\nfavorite with the people, who crowded around her wherever she appeared,\r\neager to catch a glimpse of her beautiful features. She brought into the\r\ncountry a troop of French ladies and waiting-women, some of whom\r\nremained, and married in Castile. Such as returned home, she provided\r\nwith liberal dowries. To persons of her own nation she was ever\r\naccessible,--receiving the humblest as well as the highest, says her\r\nbiographer, with her wonted benignity. With them she conversed in her\r\nnative tongue. But, in the course of three months, her ready wit had so\r\nfar mastered the Castilian, that she could make herself understood in\r\nthat language, and in a short time spoke it with elegance, though with a\r\nslight foreign accent, not unpleasing. Born and bred among a people so\r\ndifferent from that with whom her lot was now cast, Isabella seemed to\r\nunite in her own person the good qualities of each. The easy vivacity of\r\nthe French character was so happily tempered by the gravity of the\r\nSpanish, as to give an inexpressible charm to her manners.[1552] Thus\r\nrichly endowed with the best gifts of nature and of fortune, it is no\r\nwonder that Elizabeth of France should have been the delight of the\r\ncourtly circle over which she presided, and of which she was the\r\ngreatest ornament.\r\n\r\nHer gentle nature must have been much disturbed, by witnessing the wild,\r\ncapricious temper of Carlos, and the daily increasing estrangement of\r\nhis father. Yet she did not despair of reclaiming him. At least, we may\r\ninfer so from the eagerness with which she seconded her mother in\r\npressing the union of her sister, Catherine de Medicis' younger\r\ndaughter, with the prince. \"My sister is of so excellent a disposition,\"\r\nthe queen said to Ruy Gomez, \"that no princess in Christendom would be\r\nmore apt to moderate and accommodate herself to my step-son's humors, or\r\nbe better suited to the father, as well as the son, in their relations\r\nwith each other.\"[1553] But although the minister readily adopted the\r\nqueen's views in the matter, they met with little encouragement from\r\nPhilip, who, at that time, seemed more inclined to a connection with the\r\nhouse of Austria.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HER ILLNESS.]\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter, we have seen the pain occasioned to Isabella\r\nby the arrest of Carlos. Although so far a gainer by it as it opened to\r\nher own posterity the way to the succession, she wept, as the ambassador\r\nFourquevaulx tells us, for two days, over the misfortune of her\r\nstep-son, until forbidden by Philip to weep any longer.[1554] During his\r\nconfinement, as we have seen, she was not permitted to visit him,--not\r\neven to soften the bitterness of his dying hour. And how much her\r\npresence would have soothed him, at such a time, may be inferred from\r\nthe simple memorandum found among his papers, in which he assigns her\r\nthe first place among his friends, as having been ever the most loving\r\nto him.[1555] The same affection, however we may define it, which he had\r\nborne her from the first, he retained to the last hour of his life. All\r\nthat was now granted to Isabella was the sad consolation of joining with\r\nthe Princess Joanna, and the few friends who still cherished the memory\r\nof Carlos, in celebrating his funeral obsequies.\r\n\r\nNot long after that event, it was announced that the queen was pregnant;\r\nand the nation fondly hoped that it would find a compensation for the\r\nloss of its rightful prince, in the birth of a new heir to the throne.\r\nBut this hope was destined soon to be destroyed. Owing to some\r\nmismanagement on the part of the physicians, who, at an early period,\r\nmisunderstood the queen's situation, the medicines they gave her had an\r\ninjurious effect on her constitution.[1556] It is certain that Isabella\r\nplaced little confidence in the Spanish doctors, or in their\r\nprescriptions.[1557] There may have been good ground for her distrust;\r\nfor their vigorous applications savor not a little of the Sangrado\r\nschool of practice, directed quite as much against the constitution of\r\nthe patient as against his disease. About the middle of September a\r\nfever set in, which, though not violent, was so obstinate as to defy all\r\nthe efforts of the physicians to reduce it. More alarming symptoms soon\r\nfollowed. The queen frequently swooned. Her extremities became torpid.\r\nMedicines were of no avail, for her stomach refused to retain\r\nthem.[1558] Processions were everywhere made to the churches, and young\r\nand old joined in prayers for her recovery. But these prayers were not\r\nheard. The strength of Isabella continued rapidly to decline, and by the\r\nlast of September her life was despaired of. The physicians declared\r\nthat science could go no further, and that the queen's only hope must be\r\nin Heaven.[1559]--In Heaven she had always trusted; nor was she so\r\nwedded to the pomps and glories of the world, that she could not now\r\nwillingly resign them.\r\n\r\nAs her ladies, many of them her countrywomen, stood weeping around her\r\nbed, she endeavored to console them under their affliction, kindly\r\nexpressing the interest she took in their future welfare, and her regret\r\nthat she had not made them a bitter mistress;--\"as if,\" says a\r\ncontemporary, who has left a minute record of her last moments, \"she had\r\nnot been always more of a mother than a mistress to them all!\"[1560]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the second of October, as Isabella felt herself\r\ndrawing near her end, she made her will. She then confessed, partook of\r\nthe sacrament, and, at her desire, extreme unction was administered to\r\nher. Cardinal Espinosa and the king's confessor, the bishop of Cuenca,\r\nwho were present, while they offered her spiritual counsel and\r\nconsolation, were greatly edified by her deportment; and, giving her\r\ntheir parting benediction, they went away deeply affected by the spirit\r\nof Christian resignation which she displayed.[1561]\r\n\r\nBefore daybreak, on the following morning, she had her last interview\r\nwith Philip. We have the account of it from Fourquevaulx. \"The queen\r\nspoke to her husband very naturally,\" says the ambassador, \"and like a\r\nChristian. She took leave of him for ever, and never did princess show\r\nmore goodness and piety. She commended to him her two daughters, and her\r\nprincipal attendants, beseeching him to live in amity with the king of\r\nFrance, her brother, and to maintain peace,--with other discourse, which\r\ncould not fail to touch the heart of _a good husband, which the king was\r\nto her_. He showed, in his replies, the same composure as she did, and\r\npromised to obey all her requests, but added, he did not think her end\r\nso near. He then withdrew,--as I was told,--in great anguish, to his own\r\nchamber.\"[1562] Philip sent a fragment of the true cross, to comfort his\r\nwife in her last moments. It was the most precious of his relics, and\r\nwas richly studded with pearls and diamonds.[1563] Isabella fervently\r\nkissed the sacred relic, and held it, with the crucifix, in her hand,\r\nwhile she yet lived.\r\n\r\nNot long after the interview with her husband, the ambassador was\r\nsummoned to her bedside. He was the representative of her native land,\r\nand of the dear friends there she was never more to see. \"She knew me,\"\r\nwrites Fourquevaulx, \"and said, 'You see me in the act of quitting this\r\nvain world, to pass to a more pleasant kingdom; there, as I hope, to be\r\nfor ever with my God. Tell my mother, the queen, and the king, my\r\nbrother, to bear my death with patience, and to comfort themselves with\r\nthe reflection, that no happiness on earth has ever made me so content,\r\nas the prospect now does of approaching my Creator. I shall soon be in a\r\nbetter situation to do them service, and to implore God to take them and\r\nmy brothers under his holy protection. Beseech them, in my name, to\r\nwatch over their kingdom, that an end may be put to the heresies which\r\nhave spread there. And I will pray Heaven, in its mercy, to grant that\r\nthey may take my death with patience, and hold me for happy.'\"[1564]\r\n\r\nThe ambassador said a few words of comfort, endeavoring to give her, if\r\npossible, some hopes of life. But she answered, \"You will soon know how\r\nnear I am to my end. God has given me grace to despise the world and its\r\ngrandeur, and to fix all my hopes on him and Jesus Christ. Never did a\r\nthought occasion me less anxiety than that of death.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HER OBSEQUIES.]\r\n\r\n\"She then listened to the exhortations of her confessor, remaining in\r\nfull possession of her consciousness, till a few minutes before her\r\ndeath. A slight restlessness seemed to come over her, which soon\r\nsubsided, and she expired so tranquilly that it was impossible to fix\r\nthe moment when she gave up the ghost. Yet she opened her eyes once,\r\nbright and glancing, and it seemed as if she would address me some\r\nfurther commands,--at least, her looks were fixed on me.\"[1565]\r\n\r\nNot long before Isabella's death, she was delivered of a daughter. Its\r\nbirth was premature, and it lived only to be baptized. The infant was\r\nlaid in the same coffin with its mother; and, that very evening, their\r\nremains were borne in solemn procession to the royal chapel.[1566] The\r\ntolling of the bells in the churches and monasteries throughout the city\r\nannounced the sad tidings to the people, who filled the air with their\r\ncries, making everywhere the most passionate demonstrations of\r\ngrief;[1567] for the queen, says Brantôme, \"was regarded by them not\r\nmerely with feelings of reverence, but of idolatry.\"[1568]\r\n\r\nIn the chapel were gathered together whatever was illustrious in the\r\ncapital,--the high ecclesiastics, and the different religious bodies,\r\nthe grandees and cavaliers of the court, and the queen's ladies of\r\nhonor. At the head of these stood the duchess of Alva, the mistress of\r\nthe robes, with the duchess of Feria--an English lady, married to the\r\nSpanish ambassador at the court of Mary Tudor--and the princess of\r\nEboli, a name noted in history. The coffin of the deceased queen,\r\ncovered with its gorgeous pall of brocade, was placed on a scaffold\r\nshrouded in black, and surrounded with numerous silver sconces bearing\r\nwax tapers, that shed a gloomy lustre over the scene.[1569] The services\r\nwere performed amidst the deepest stillness of the audience, unless when\r\nbroken by the wailings of the women, which mingled in sad harmony with\r\nthe chant of the priests and the sweet and solemn music that accompanied\r\nthe office for the dead.[1570]\r\n\r\nEarly on the following morning the coffin was opened in presence of the\r\nduchess of Alva and the weeping ladies of her train, who gazed for the\r\nlast time on features still beautiful in death.[1571] The duchess then\r\nfilled the coffin with flowers and sweet-scented herbs; and the remains\r\nof mother and child were transported by the same sorrowing company to\r\nthe convent of the barefooted Carmelites. Here they reposed till the\r\nyear 1573, when they were borne, with the remains of Carlos, to the\r\nstately mausoleum of the Escorial; and the populace, as they gazed on\r\nthe funeral train, invoked the name of Isabella as that of a\r\nsaint.[1572]\r\n\r\nIn the course of the winter, Cardinal Guise arrived from France with\r\nletters of condolence from Charles the Ninth to his royal\r\nbrother-in-law. The instructions to the cardinal do not infer any\r\ndistrust, on the part of the French monarch, as to the manner of his\r\nsister's death. The more suspicious temper of the queen-mother,\r\nCatherine de Medicis, is seen in her directions to Fourquevaulx to find\r\nout what was said on the subject of her daughter's death, and to report\r\nit to her.[1573]--It does not seem that the ambassador gathered any\r\ninformation of consequence, to add to his former details.\r\n\r\nPhilip himself may have had in his mind the possible existence of such\r\nsuspicions, when he told the cardinal that \"his best consolation for his\r\nloss was derived from his reflection on the simple and excellent life of\r\nthe queen. All her attendants, her ladies and maids, knew how well he\r\nhad treated her, as was sufficiently proved by the extraordinary sorrow\r\nwhich he felt at her death. Hereupon,\" continues the cardinal, \"he broke\r\nforth into a panegyric on her virtues, and said, were he to choose\r\nagain, he could wish nothing better than to find just such\r\nanother.\"[1574]--It was not long before Philip made the attempt. In\r\neighteen months from the date of his conversation with the cardinal, the\r\nthrice-widowed husband led to the altar his fourth and last wife, Anne\r\nof Austria,--like her predecessor, as we have seen, the destined bride\r\nof his son. The facility with which her imperial parents trusted the\r\nyoung princess to the protection of Philip maybe thought to intimate\r\npretty clearly that they, at least, had no misgivings as to the king's\r\ntreatment of his former wife.\r\n\r\nIsabella, at her decease, was but twenty-three years of age, eight of\r\nwhich she had been seated on the throne of Spain. She left two children,\r\nboth daughters;--Catherine, afterwards married to the duke of Savoy; and\r\nClara Eugenia, who became with her husband, the Archduke Albert, joint\r\nruler of the Netherlands, and who seems to have enjoyed a greater share\r\nof both the love and the confidence of Philip, than he ever vouchsafed\r\nto any other being.\r\n\r\nSuch is the story of Queen Isabella, stripped of the coloring of\r\nromance, for which, in truth, it has been quite as much indebted to the\r\npen of the historian as to that of the poet. From the whole account, it\r\nappears, that, if Carlos, at any time, indulged a criminal passion for\r\nhis step-mother, such a passion was never requited or encouraged by\r\nIsabella, who seems to have felt for him only the sentiments that were\r\njustified by their connection, and by the appeal which his misfortunes\r\nmade to her sympathy. Notwithstanding some feelings of resentment, not\r\nunnatural, when, in the words of Brantôme, \"he had been defrauded of so\r\nfair a prize,\" there is yet little evidence that the prince's passion\r\nfor her rose higher than the sentiments of love and gratitude which her\r\nkindness might well have awakened in an affectionate nature.[1575] And\r\nthat such, with all his errors, was the nature Carlos, is shown, among\r\nother examples, by his steady attachment to Don John of Austria, his\r\nuncle, and by his devotion to his early preceptor, the bishop of Osma.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HER CHARACTER.]\r\n\r\nThere is no proof that Philip was, at any time, displeased with the\r\nconduct of his queen, or that he regarded his son in the light of a\r\nrival. Least of all is there anything in the history of the time to show\r\nthat he sacrificed his wife to his jealousy.[1576] The contrary is well\r\nestablished by those of her own countrymen who had free access to her\r\nduring her lifetime,--some of them in the hour of her death,--whose\r\ncorrespondence with her family would not have failed to intimate their\r\nsuspicions, had there been anything to suspect.\r\n\r\nWell would it be for the memory of Philip the Second, could the\r\nhistorian find no heavier sin to lay to his charge than his treatment of\r\nIsabella. From first to last, he seems to have regarded her with the\r\nindulgence of an affectionate husband. Whether she ever obtained such an\r\nascendancy over his close and cautious nature as to be allowed to share\r\nin his confidence and his counsels, may well be doubted. Her temper\r\nwould seem to have been too gentle, too devoid of worldly ambition, to\r\nprompt her to meddle with affairs for which she was fitted neither by\r\nnature nor education. Yet Brantôme assures us, that she exercised a most\r\nsalutary influence over her lord in his relations with France, and that\r\nthe value of this influence was appreciated in later times, when the\r\ngrowing misunderstandings between the two courts were left to rankle,\r\nwithout any friendly hand to heal them.[1577] \"Her death,\" he continues,\r\n\"was as bitter to her own nation as it was to the Spaniards; and if the\r\nlatter called her 'the Queen of Peace and Goodness,' the former with no\r\nless reason styled her 'the Olive-branch.'\"[1578] \"But she has passed\r\naway,\" he exclaims, \"in the sweet and pleasant April of her age,--when\r\nher beauty was such that it seemed as if it might almost defy the\r\nassaults of time.\"[1579]\r\n\r\nThe queen occupies an important place in that rich gallery of portraits\r\nin which Brantôme has endeavored to perpetuate the features of his\r\ncontemporaries. In no one of them has he traced the lineaments with a\r\nmore tender and delicate hand. Even the breath of scandal has had no\r\npower to dim the purity of their expression. Of all that illustrious\r\ncompany which the artist has brought in review before the eyes of\r\nposterity, there is no one to whom he has so truly rendered the homage\r\nof the heart, as to Elizabeth of France.\r\n\r\nBut from these scenes of domestic sorrow, it is time that we should turn\r\nto others of a more stirring and adventurous character.\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLS. I. AND II.\r\n\r\nLONDON C. WHITING, BEAUFORT-HOUSE, DUKE-STREET, LINCOLN'S-INN-FIELDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] It is gratifying to learn that before long such a history may be\r\nexpected,--if, indeed, it should not appear before the publication of\r\nthis work,--from the pen of our accomplished countryman, Mr. J. Lothrop\r\nMotley, who, during the last few years, for the better prosecution of\r\nhis labors, has established his residence in the neighborhood of the\r\nscenes of his narrative. No one acquainted with the fine powers of mind\r\npossessed by this scholar, and the earnestness with which he has devoted\r\nhimself to his task, can doubt that he will do full justice to his\r\nimportant, but difficult subject.\r\n\r\n[2] \"Post annum ætatis quinquagesimum, prementitras morbis, tantopere\r\nnegotiorum odium cepit, ut diutius interdum nec se adiri aut conveniri\r\npræterquam ab intimis pateretur, nec libellis subscribere animum\r\ninduceret, _non sine suspicione mentis imminutæ_; itaque constat novem\r\nmensibus nulli nec libello nec diplomati subscripsisse, quod cum magno\r\nincommodo reipublicæ populariumque dispendio fiebat, cum a tot\r\nnationibus, et quibusdam longissime jus inde poteretur, et certe summa\r\nnegotia ad ipsum fere rejicerentur.\" (Sepulvedæ Opera, (Matriti, 1780,)\r\nvol. II. p. 539.) The author, who was in the court at the time, had\r\nfrequent access to the royal presence, and speaks, therefore, from\r\npersonal observation.\r\n\r\n[3] A minute account of this imposing ceremony is to be found in a MS.\r\nin the Archives of Simancas, now published in the Coleccion de\r\nDocumentos Inéditos para la Historia de España, (Madrid, 1845,) tom.\r\nVII. p. 534 et seq.\r\n\r\nAn official report of these proceedings, prepared by order of the\r\ngovernment, and preserved at Brussels, in the Archives du Royaume, has\r\nbeen published by M. Gachard in his valuable collection, Analectes\r\nBelgiques, (Paris, 1830,) pp. 75-81.\r\n\r\n[4] A copy of the original deed of abdication was preserved among the\r\npapers of Cardinal Granvelle, at Besançon, and is incorporated in the\r\nvaluable collection of documents published by order of the French\r\ngovernment under the direction of the learned Weiss, Papiers d'Etat du\r\nCardinal de Granvelle, d'après les Manuscrits de la Bibliothèque de\r\nBesançon, (Paris, 1843,) tom. IV. p. 486.\r\n\r\n[5] It is strange that the precise date of an event of such notoriety as\r\nthe abdication of Charles the Fifth should be a matter of discrepancy\r\namong historians. Most writers of the time assign the date mentioned in\r\nthe text, confirmed moreover by the Simancas MS. above cited, the author\r\nof which enters into the details of the ceremony with the minuteness of\r\nan eye-witness.\r\n\r\n[6] \"Erat Carolus statura mediocri, sed brachiis et cruribus crassis\r\ncompactisque, et roboris singularis, ceteris membris proportione\r\nmagnoque commensu respondentibus, colore albus, crine barbaque ad flavum\r\ninclinante; facie liberali, nisi quod mentum prominens et parum\r\ncohærentia labra nonnihil eam deturpabant.\" Sepulvedæ Opera, vol.

The historian Sandoval also gives\r\na full report of the speech, on the authority of one who heard it.\r\nHistoria de la Vida y Hechos del Emperador Carlos V., (Amberes, 1681,)\r\ntom.

And yet he prayed\r\nthem to bear with his imperfection, proceeding of sickly age, and of the\r\nmentioning of so tender a matter as the departing from such a sort of\r\ndear and most loving subjects.\"--The Order of the Cession of the Low\r\nCountries to the King's Majesty, MS.\r\n\r\n[9] The date of this renunciation is also a subject of disagreement\r\namong contemporary historians, although it would seem to be settled by\r\nthe date of the instrument itself, which is published by Sandoval, in\r\nhis Hist. de Carlos V., tom. II. pp. 603-606.\r\n\r\n[10] Lanz, Correspondenz des Kaisers Karl V., B. III. s. 708.\r\n\r\nFive years before this period Charles had endeavored to persuade\r\nFerdinand to relinquish to Philip the pretensions which, as king of the\r\nRomans, he had to the empire. This negotiation failed, as might have\r\nbeen expected. Ferdinand was not weary of the world; and Charles could\r\noffer no bribe large enough to buy off an empire. See the account given\r\nby Marillac, ap. Raumer, Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries, (London,\r\n1835, Eng. trans.,) vol. I. p. 28 et seq.\r\n\r\n[11] \"Favor sin duda del Cielo,\" says Sandoval, who gives quite a\r\nmiraculous air to the event, by adding that the emperor's vessel\r\nencountered the brunt of the storm, and foundered in port. (Hist. de\r\nCarlos V., tom. II. p. 607.) But this and some other particulars told by\r\nthe historian of Charles's landing, unconfirmed as they are by a single\r\neye-witness, may be reckoned among the myths of the voyage.\r\n\r\n[12] The last of Philip's letters, dated September 8, is given entire in\r\nthe MS. of Don Tomas Gonzales, (Retiro, Estancia, y Muerte del Emperador\r\nCarlos Quinto en el Monasterio de Yuste,) which forms the basis of\r\nMignet's interesting account of Charles the Fifth.\r\n\r\n[13] Among other disappointments was that of not receiving four thousand\r\nducats which Joanna had ordered to be placed at the emperor's\r\ndisposition on his landing. This appears from a letter of the emperor's\r\nsecretary, Gaztelu, to Vazquez de Molina, October 6, 1556. \"El emperador\r\ntovo por cierto que llegado aqui, hallaria los cuatro mil ducados que el\r\nrey le dijo habia mandado proveer, y visto que no se ha hecho, me ha\r\nmandado lo escribiese luego à Vuestra Merced, para que se haya, porque\r\nson mucho menester.\" MS.\r\n\r\n[14] Sandoval makes no allusion to the affair, which rests on the report\r\nof Strada, (De Bello Belgico (Antverpiæ, 1640,) tom. I. p. 12,) and of\r\nCabrera,--the latter, as one of the royal household and the\r\nhistoriographer of Castile, by far the best authority. In the narration\r\nhe does not spare his master. \"En Jarendilla ameno lugar del Conde de\r\nOropesa, espero treinta dias treinta mil escudos con que pagar y\r\ndispedir sus criados que llegaron con tarda provision y mano; terrible\r\ntentacion para no dar todo su aver antes de la muerte.\" Filipe Segundo\r\nRey de España, (Madrid, 1619,) lib. II. cap. 11.\r\n\r\nThe letters from Jarandilla at this time show the embarrassments under\r\nwhich the emperor labored from want of funds. His exchequer was so low,\r\nindeed, that on one occasion he was obliged to borrow a hundred reals\r\nfor his ordinary expenses from his major-domo. \"Los ultimos dos mil\r\nducados que trujo el criado de Hernando Ochoa se han acabo, porque\r\ncuando llegáron, se debian ya la mitad, de manera que no tenemos un real\r\npara el gasto ordinario, que para socorrer hoy he dado yo cien reales,\r\nni se sabe de donde haberlo.\" Carta de Luis Quixada à Juan Vazquez, ap.\r\nGachard, Retraite et Mort de Charles-Quint, (Bruxelles, 1554,) tom.

The\r\ncopy in my possession is from the ducal library at Gotha. Sir Henry\r\nEllis, in the Second Series of his \"Original Letters,\" has given an\r\nabstract of the Cottonian MS.\r\n\r\n[50] This agrees with the Lansdowne MS.

Opera, tom. III. p. 309.\r\n\r\n[62] Yet the emperor seems to have written in a somewhat different style\r\nto his ambassador at the English court. \"Desfaillant la force pour\r\ndonner assistance à nostre-dicte cousine comme aussy vous sçavez qu'elle\r\ndeffault pour l'empeschement que l'on nous donne du coustel de France,\r\nnous ne véons aulcun apparent moyen pour assheurer la personne de\r\nnostre-dicte cousine.\" L'Empereur à ses Ambassadeurs en Angleterre, 11\r\njuillet, 1553, Papiers d'Etat de Granvelle, tom. IV, p. 25.\r\n\r\n[63] Charles, in a letter to his ambassador in London, dated July 22,\r\n1553, after much good counsel which he was to give Queen Mary, in the\r\nemperor's name, respecting the government of her kingdom, directs him to\r\nhint to her that the time had come when it would be well for the queen\r\nto provide herself with a husband, and if his advice could be of any use\r\nin the affair, she was entirely welcome to it. \"Et aussy lui direz-vous\r\nqu'il sera besoin que pour etre seustenue audit royaulme, emparée et\r\ndeffendue, mesmes en choses que ne sont de la profession de dames, il\r\nsera très-requis que tost elle prenne party de mariaige avec qui il luy\r\nsemblera estre plus convenable, tenant regard à ce que dessus; et que\r\ns'il lui plaît nous faire part avant que s'y déterminer, nous ne\r\nfauldrons de, avec la sincérité de l'affection que lui portons, luy\r\nfaire entendre libéralement, sur ce qu'elle voudra mettre en avant,\r\nnostre advis, et de l'ayder et favoriser en ce qu'elle se déterminera.\"\r\nL'Empereur à ses Ambassadeurs en Angleterre, 22 juillet, 1553, Ibid., p.\r\n56.\r\n\r\n[64] Granvelle, who owed no good-will to the minister for the part which\r\nhe afterwards took in the troubles of Flanders, frequently puns on\r\nKenard's name, which he seems to have thought altogether significant of\r\nhis character.\r\n\r\n[65] \"Quant à Cortenay, vous pourriez bien dire, pour éviter au propoz\r\nmencionné en voz lettres, que l'on en parle, pour veoir ce qu'elle dira;\r\nmais gardez-vous de luy tout desfaire et mesmes qu'elle n'aye descouvert\r\nplus avant son intention; car si elle y avoit fantasie, elle ne layroit\r\n(si elle est du naturel des aultres femmes) de passer oultre, et si se\r\nressentiroit à jamais de ce que vous luy en pourriés avoir dit. Bien luy\r\npourriés-vous toucher des commoditez plus grandes que pourroit recepvoir\r\nde mariaige estrangier, sans trop toucher à la personne où elle pourroit\r\navoir affection.\" L'Evêque d'Arras à Renard. 14 août, 1553, Ibid., p.\r\n77.\r\n\r\n[66] \"Quant je luy fiz l'ouverture de mariaige, elle se print à rire,\r\nnon une foys ains plusieurs foys, me regardant d'un oeil signifiant\r\nl'ouverture luy estre fort aggréable, me donnant assez à cognoistre\r\nqu'elle ne taichoit ou désiroit mariaige d'Angleterre.\" Renard à\r\nl'Evêque d'Arras, 15 août, 1558, Ibid., p. 78.\r\n\r\n[67] \"Et, sans attendre la fin de ces propoz, elle jura que jamais elle\r\nn'avoit senti esguillon de ce que l'on appelle amor, ny entré en\r\npensement de volupté, et qu'elle n'avoit jamais pensé à mariaige sinon\r\ndepuys que a pieu à Dieu la promovoir à la couronne, et que celluy\r\nqu'elle fera sera contre sa propre affection, pour le respect de la\r\nchose publicque; qu'elle se tient toute assurée sa majesté aura\r\nconsidération à ce qu'elle m'a dict et qu'elle désire l'obéir et\r\ncomplaire en tout et par tout comme son propre père; qu'elle n'oseroit\r\nentrer en propoz de mariaige avec ceulx de son conseil, que fault, le\r\ncas advenant, que vienne de la meute de sa majesté.\" Renard à l'Evêque\r\nd'Arras, 8 septembre, 1553, Ibid., p. 98.\r\n\r\n[68] \"Vous la pourrez asseurer que, si nous estions en caige et\r\ndisposition telle qu'il conviendroit, et que jugissions que de ce peut\r\nredonder le bien de ses affaires, nous ne vouldrions choysir aultre\r\nparty en ce monde plus tost que de nous alier nous-mesmes avec elle, et\r\nseroit bien celle que nous pourrait donner austant de satisfaction.\"\r\nL'Empereur à Renard, 20 septembre, 1553, Ibid., p. 112.\r\n\r\n[69] Ibid., pp. 108-116.\r\n\r\nSimon Renard, the imperial ambassador at this time at the English court,\r\nwas a native of Franche Comté, and held the office of _maître aux\r\nrequêtes_ in the household of the emperor. Renard, though a man of a\r\nfactious turn, was what Granvelle's correspondent, Morillon, calls \"_un\r\nbon politique_,\" and in many respects well suited to the mission on\r\nwhich he was employed. His correspondence is of infinite value, as\r\nshowing the Spanish moves in this complicated game, which ended in the\r\nmarriage of Mary with the heir of the Castilian monarchy. It is\r\npreserved in the archives of Brussels. Copies of these MSS., amounting\r\nto five volumes folio, were to be found in the collection of Cardinal\r\nGranvelle at Besançon. A part of them was lent to Griffet for the\r\ncompilation of his \"Nouveaux Eclaircissemens sur l'Histoire de Marie\r\nReine d'Angleterre.\" Unfortunately, Griffet omitted to restore the MSS.;\r\nand an hiatus is thus occasioned in the series of the Renard\r\ncorrespondence embraced in the Granvelle Papers now in process of\r\npublication by the French Government. It were to be wished that this\r\nhiatus had been supplied from the originals, in the archives of\r\nBrussels. Mr. Tytler has done good service by giving to the world a\r\nselection from the latter part of Renard's correspondence, which had\r\nbeen transcribed by order of the Record Commission from the MSS. in\r\nBrussels.\r\n\r\n[70] \"Car si, quant à soy, il luy semble estre chose que ne luy convînt\r\nou ne fût faisable, il ne seroit à propoz, comme elle l'entend\r\ntres-bien, d'en faire déclaracion à qui que ce soit; mais, en cas aussi\r\nqu'elle jugea le party luy estre convenable et qu'elle y print\r\ninclinacion, si, à son advis, la difficulté tumba sur les moyens, et que\r\nen iceulx elle ne se peut résoldre sans la participation d'aulcuns de\r\nson conseil, vous la pourriez en ce cas requérir qu'elle voulût prendre\r\nde vous confiance pour vous déclairer à qui elle en vouldroit tenir\r\npropoz, et ce qu'elle en vouldroit communicquer et par quelz moyens.\"\r\nL'Empereur à Renard, 20 septembre, 1553, Ibid., p. 114.\r\n\r\n[71] The Spanish match seems to have been as distasteful to the\r\nPortuguese as it was to the English, and probably for much the same\r\nreasons. See the letter of Granvelle, of August 14, 1553, Ibid., p. 77.\r\n\r\n[72] \"Les estrangiers, qu'ilz abhorrissent plus que nulle aultre\r\nnacion.\" L'Empereur à Renard, 20 septembre, 1553, Ibid., p. 113.\r\n\r\n[73] \"Et si la difficulté se treuvoit aux conseillers pour leur intéretz\r\nparticulier, comme plus ilz sont intéressez, il pourroit estre que l'on\r\nauroit meilleur moyen de les gaigner, assheurant ceulz par le moyen\r\ndesquelz la chose se pourroit conduyre, des principaulz offices et\r\ncharges dudict royaulme, voyre et leur offrant appart sommes notables de\r\ndeniers ou accroissance de rentes, priviléges et prérogatives.\"\r\nL'Empereur à Renard, 20 septembre, 1553, Ibid., p. 113.\r\n\r\n[74] In order to carry on the negotiation with greater secrecy, Renard's\r\ncolleagues at the English court, who were found to intermeddle somewhat\r\nunnecessarily with the business, were recalled; and the whole affair was\r\nintrusted exclusively to that envoy, and to Granvelle, the bishop of\r\nArras, who communicated to him the views of the emperor from\r\nBrussels.--\"Et s'est résolu taut plus l'empereur rappeler voz collègues,\r\nafin que aulcung d'iceulx ne vous y traversa ou bien empescha s'y estans\r\nmontrez peu affectionnez, et pour non si bien entendre le cours de ceste\r\nnégociation, et pour aussi que vous garderez mieulx le secret qu'est\r\ntant requis et ne se pourroit faire, passant ceste négociation par\r\nplusieurs mains.\" L'Evêque d'Arras à Renard, 13 septembre, 1553, Ibid.,\r\np. 103.\r\n\r\n[75] \"Pour la requerir et supplier d'eslire ung seigneur de son pays\r\npour estre son mary, et ne vouloir prendre personnaige en mariaige, ny\r\nleur donner prince qui leur puisse commander aultre que de sa nation.\"\r\nAmbassades de Noailles, (Leyde, 1763,) tom.

Tytler, England\r\nunder the Reigns of Edward VI. and Mary, (vol. II. pp. 326-329,)--a work\r\nin which the author, by the publication of original documents, and his\r\nown sagacious commentary, has done much for the illustration of this\r\nportion of English history.\r\n\r\n[88] Florez, Reynas Catholicas, tom. II. p. 890.\r\n\r\n[89] Philip would have preferred that Charles should carry out his\r\noriginal design, by taking Mary for his own wife. But he acquiesced,\r\nwithout a murmur, in the choice his father made for him. Mignet quotes a\r\npassage from a letter of Philip to the emperor on this subject, which\r\nshows him to have been a pattern of filial obedience. The letter is\r\ncopied by Gonzales in his unpublished work, Retiro y Estancia de Carlos\r\nQuinto.--\"Y que pues piensan proponer su matrimonio con Vuestra\r\nMagestad, hallandose en disposicion para ello, esto seria lo mas\r\nacertado.

A hundred horses might well have\r\ndrawn as many tons of gold and silver,--an amount, considering the value\r\nof money in that day, that taxes our faith somewhat heavily, and not the\r\nless that only two wagons were employed to carry it.\r\n\r\n[112] Holinshed, ubi supra.\r\n\r\n[113] Relatione di Gio. Micheli, MS.\r\n\r\nMichele Soriano, who represented Venice at Madrid, in 1559, bears\r\nsimilar testimony, in still stronger language, to Philip's altered\r\ndeportment while in England. \"Essendo avvertito prima dal Cardinale di\r\nTrento, poi dalla Regina Maria, et con più efficaccia dal padre, che\r\nquella riputatione et severità non si conveniva a lui, che dovea dominar\r\nnationi varie et popoli di costumi diversi, si mutò in modo che passando\r\nl'altra volta di Spagna per andar in Inghilterra, ha mostrato sempre una\r\ndolcezza et humanità così grande che non è superato da Prencipe alcuno\r\nin questa parte, et benchè servi in tutte l'attioni sue riputatione et\r\ngravità regie alle quali e per natura inclinato et per costume, non è\r\nperò manco grato anzi fano parere la cortesia maggiore che S.

Micheli, MS.\r\n\r\n[118] Ibid.\r\n\r\n[119] Ibid.\r\n\r\nMason, the English minister at the imperial court, who had had much\r\nintercourse with Pole, speaks of him in terms of unqualified admiration.\r\n\"Such a one as, for his wisdom, joined with learning, virtue, and\r\ngodliness, all the world seeketh and adoreth. In whom it is to be\r\nthought that God hath chosen a special place of habitation. Such is his\r\nconversation adorned with infinite godly qualities, above the ordinary\r\nsort of men. And whosoever within the realm liketh him worst, I would he\r\nmight have with him the talk of one half-hour. It were a right stony\r\nheart that in a small time he could not soften.\" Letter of Sir John\r\nMason to the Queen, MS.\r\n\r\n[120] If we are to credit Cabrera, Philip not only took his seat in\r\nparliament, but on one occasion, the better to conciliate the good-will\r\nof the legislature to the legate, delivered a speech which the historian\r\ngives _in extenso_. If he ever made the speech, it could have been\r\nunderstood only by a miracle. For Philip could not speak English, and of\r\nhis audience not one in a hundred, probably, could understand Spanish.\r\nBut to the Castilian historian the occasion might seem worthy of a\r\nmiracle,--_dignus vindice nodus._\r\n\r\n[121] \"Obraron de suerte Don Felipe con prudencia, agrado, honras, y\r\nmercedes, y su familia con la cortesía natural de España, que se reduxo\r\nInglaterra toda à la obediencia de la Iglesia Catolica Romana, y se\r\nabjuraron los errores y heregias que corrían en aquel Reyno,\" says\r\nVanderhammen, Felipe el Prudente, p. 4.\r\n\r\n[122] Strype, Memorials, vol. III. p. 209.\r\n\r\n[123] Philip, in a letter to the Regent Joanna, dated Brussels, 1557,\r\nseems to claim for himself the merit of having extirpated heresy in\r\nEngland by the destruction of the heretics. \"Aviendo apartado deste\r\nReyno las sectas, i reduzidole à la obediencia de la Inglesia, i aviendo\r\nido sempre en acrecentamiento con el castigo de los Ereges tan sin\r\ncontradiciones como se haze en Inglaterra.\" (Cabrera, Filipe Segundo,\r\nlib. II. cap. 6.) The emperor, in a letter from Yuste, indorses this\r\nclaim of his son to the full extent. \"Pues en Ynglaterra se han hecho y\r\nhacen tantas y tan crudas justicias hasta obispos, por la orden que alli\r\nha dado, como si fuera su Rey natural, y se lo permiten.\" Carta del\r\nEmperador a la Princesa, Mayo 25, 1558, MS.\r\n\r\n[124] Micheli, whose testimony is of the more value, as he was known to\r\nhave joined Noailles in his opposition to the Spanish match, tells us\r\nthat Philip was scrupulous in his observance of every article of the\r\nmarriage treaty. \"Che non havendo alterato cosa alcuna dello stile, et\r\nforma del governo, non essendo uscito un pelo della capitolatione del\r\nmatrimonio, ha in tutto tolta via quella paura che da principio fù\r\ngrandissima, che egli non volesse con imperio, et con la potentia,\r\ndisporre, et comandare delle cose à modo suo.\" Relatione di Gio.\r\nMicheli, MS.\r\n\r\n[125] \"D'amor nasce l'esser inamorata come è et giustamente del marito\r\nper quel che s'ha potuto conoscer nel tempo che è stata seco dalla\r\nnatura et modi suoi, certo da innamorar ognuno, non che chi havesse\r\nhavuto la buona compagnia et il buon trattamento ch'ell'ha havuto. Tale\r\nin verità che nessun'altro potrebbe essergli stato nè migliore nè più\r\namorevol marito.... Se appresso al martello s'aggiungesse la gelosia,\r\ndella qual fin hora non si sa che patisca, perche se non ha il Re per\r\ncasto, almanco dice ella so che è libero dell'amor d'altra donna; se\r\nfosse dico gelosa, sarebbe veramente misera.\" Relatione di Gio. Micheli,\r\nMS.\r\n\r\n[126] Holinshed, vol. IV. pp. 70, 82.\r\n\r\n[127] Soriano notices the little authority that Philip seemed to possess\r\nin England, and the disgust which it occasioned both to him and his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\"L'imperatore, che dissegnava sempre cose grandi, pensò potersi\r\nacquistare il regno con occasione di matrimonio di quella regina nel\r\nfigliuolo; ma non gli successe quel che desiderava, perche questo Re\r\ntrovò tant'impedimenti et tante difficolta che mi ricordo havere inteso\r\nda un personaggio che S.

X. pp. 15, 16.\r\n\r\n[143] I have three biographies of the duke of Alva, which give a view of\r\nhis whole career. The most important is one in Latin, by a Spanish\r\nJesuit named Ossorio, and entitled Ferdinandi Toletani Albæ Ducis Vita\r\net Res Gestæ (Salmanticiæ, 1669). The author wrote nearly a century\r\nafter the time of his hero. But as he seems to have had access to the\r\nbest sources of information, his narrative may be said to rest on a good\r\nfoundation. He writes in a sensible and business-like manner, more often\r\nfound among the Jesuits than among the members of the other orders. It\r\nis not surprising that the harsher features of the portrait should be\r\nsmoothed down under the friendly hand of the Jesuit commemorating the\r\ndeeds of the great champion of Catholicism.\r\n\r\nA French life of the duke, printed some thirty years later, is only a\r\ntranslation of the preceding, Histoire de Ferdinand-Alvarez de Toledo,\r\nDuc d'Albe (Paris, 1699). A work of more pretension is entitled Resultas\r\nde la Vida de Fernando Alvarez tercero Duque de Alva, escrita por Don\r\nJuan Antonio de Vera y Figueroa, Conde de la Roca (1643). It belongs,\r\napparently, to a class of works not uncommon in Spain, in which vague\r\nand uncertain statements take the place of simple narrative, and the\r\nwriter covers up his stilted panegyric with the solemn garb of moral\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\n[144] Giannone, Istoria di Napoli, tom. X. p. 27.--Consulta hecha a\r\nvarios letrados y téologos relativamente a las desavenencias con el\r\nPapa, MS.

IV. p. 270.\r\n\r\nThe most circumstantial printed account of this war is to be found in\r\nthe work of Alessandro Andrea, a Neapolitan. It was first published in\r\nItalian, at Venice, and subsequently translated by the author into\r\nCastilian, and printed at Madrid. Andrea was a soldier of some\r\nexperience, and his account of these transactions is derived partly from\r\npersonal observation, and partly, as he tells us, from the most\r\naccredited witnesses. The Spanish version was made at the suggestion of\r\none of Philip's ministers,--pretty good evidence that the writer, in his\r\nnarrative, had demeaned himself like a loyal subject.\r\n\r\n[146] Giannone, Istoria di Napoli, tom.

But accuracy does not appear to be the chief\r\nvirtue of this writer.\r\n\r\n[206] \"Manda au prince, pour toute réponse, qu'il étoit bien jeune pour\r\nvouloir lui apprendre son metier, qu'il commandoit les armées avant que\r\ncelui-ci fût au monde, et qu'il comptoit bien en vingt ans lui donner\r\nencore des leçons.\" Garnier, Histoire de France, tom.

One writer speaks of it as a Spanish\r\nsquadron from Guipuscoa. Another says the marines landed, and engaged\r\nthe enemy on shore. It is no easy matter to extract a probability from\r\nmany improbabilities. There is one fact, however, and that the most\r\nimportant one, in which all agree,--that Count Egmont won a decisive\r\nvictory over the French at Gravelines.\r\n\r\n[242] There is an interesting letter of Philip's sister, the Regent\r\nJoanna, to her father, the emperor, then in the monastery at Yuste. It\r\nwas written nearly a year before this period of our history. Joanna\r\ngives many good reasons, especially the disorders of his finances, which\r\nmade it expedient for Philip to profit by his successful campaign to\r\nconclude a peace with France,--the same which now presented themselves\r\nwith such force to both Philip and his ministers. The capture of Calais,\r\nsoon after the date of Joanna's letter, and the great preparations made\r\nby Henry, threw a weight into the enemy's scale which gave new heart to\r\nthe French to prolong the contest, until it ended with the defeat at\r\nGravelines.--Carta de la Princesa Juana al Emperador, 14 de Diciembre,\r\n1557, MS.--Carta del Emperador à la Princesa, 26 de Diciembre, 1557, MS.\r\n\r\n[243] Relatione di Giovanni Micheli, MS.--Cabrera, Filipe Segundo, lib.\r\nIV. cap. 2, 4.--Campana, Vita di Filippo Secundo, parte II. lib. 11.\r\n\r\n[244] Relatione di Giovanni Micheli, MS.\r\n\r\n[245] \"Yo os digo que yo estoy de todo punto imposibilitado à sostener\r\nla guerra....

It\r\nappears from the correspondence of Granvelle, that that minister\r\nemployed a _respectable_ agent to take charge of the letters of St.\r\nAndré, and probably of the other prisoners, and that these letters were\r\ninspected by Granvelle before they passed to the French camp. See\r\nPapiers d'Etat de Granvelle, tom. V. p. 178.\r\n\r\n[249] Some historians, among them Sismondi, seem to have given more\r\ncredit to the professions of the politic Frenchman than they deserve,\r\n(Histoire des Français, tom. XVIII. p. 73.). Granvelle, who understood\r\nthe character of his antagonist better, was not so easily duped. A\r\nmemorandum among his papers thus notices the French cardinal: \"Toute la\r\ndémonstration que faisoit ledict cardinal de Lorraine de désirer paix,\r\nestoit chose faincte à la françoise et pour nous abuser.\" Papiers d'Etat\r\nde Granvelle, tom. V. p. 168.\r\n\r\n[250] \"Adjoustant que, si Calaix demeuroit aux François, ny luy ny ses\r\ncollègues n'oseroyent retourner en Angleterre, et que certainement le\r\npeuple les lapideroit.\" Ibid., p. 319.\r\n\r\n[251] \"Were I to die this moment, want of frigates would be found\r\nwritten on my heart.\" The original of this letter of Nelson is in the\r\ncurious collection of autograph letters which belonged to the late Sir\r\nRobert Peel.\r\n\r\n[252] Philip's feelings in this matter may be gathered from a passage in\r\na letter to Granvelle, in which he says that the death of the young\r\nqueen of Scots, then very ill, would silence the pretensions which the\r\nFrench made to England, and relieve Spain from a great embarrassment.\r\n\"Si la reyna moça se muriesse, que diz que anda muy mala, nos quitaria\r\nde hartos embaraços y del derecho que pretenden à Inglaterra.\" Papiers\r\nd'Etat de Granvelle, tom. V. p. 643.\r\n\r\n[253] \"Tras esto véola muy indignada de las cosas que se han hecho\r\ncontra ella en vida de la Reina: muy asida al pueblo, y muy confiada que\r\nlo tiene todo de su parte (como es verdad), y dando à entender que el\r\nPueblo la ha puesto en el estado que está: y de esto no reconoce nada à\r\nV. M. ni à la nobleza del Reino, aunque dice que la han enviado à\r\nprometer todos que la serán fieles.\" Memorias de la Real Academia de la\r\nHistoria, (Madrid, 1832,) tom. VII. p. 254.\r\n\r\n[254] \"Non manco bella d'animo che sia di corpo; ancor'che di faccia si\r\npuó dir' che sia piu tosto gratiosa che bella.\" Relatione di Giovanni\r\nMicheli, MS.\r\n\r\n[255] \"Della persona è grande, et ben formata, di bella carne, ancor che\r\nolivastra, begl'occhi, et sopra tutto bella mano, di che fa professione,\r\nd'un spirito, et ingegno mirabile: il che ha saputo molto ben\r\ndimostrare, con l'essersi saputa ne i sospetti, et pericoli ne i quali\r\ns'è ritrovata cosi ben governare.... Si tien superba, et gloriosa per il\r\npadre; del quale dicono tutti che è anco più simile, et per cio gli fu\r\nsempre cara.\" Ibid.\r\n\r\n[256] The Spanish minister, Feria, desired his master to allow him to\r\nmention Mary's jealousy, as an argument to recommend his suit to the\r\nfavor of Elizabeth. But Philip had the good feeling--or good taste--to\r\nrefuse. Memorias de la Real Academia, tom. VII. p. 260.\r\n\r\n[257] \"Dijo que convendria consultarlo con el Parlamento; bien que el\r\nRey Católico debia estar seguro que en caso de casarse, seria él\r\npreferido á todos.\" Ibid., p. 264.\r\n\r\n[258] \"Paresceme que seria bien que el conde le hablasse claro en estas\r\ncosas de la religion, y la amonestasse y rogasse de mi parte que no\r\nhiziesse en este parlamento mudança en ella, y que si la hiciesse que yo\r\nno podria venir en lo del casamiento, como en effecto no vendria.\" Carta\r\ndel Rey Phelipe al Duque de Alba, 7 de Febrero, 1559, MS.\r\n\r\n[259] \"Convendría que hablasse claro á la Reyna, y le dixesse rasamente\r\nque aunque yo desseo mucho este negocio, (y por aquí envanesçella quanto\r\npudiesse,) pero que entendiesse que si haria mudança en la religion, yo\r\nlo hacia en este desseo y voluntad por que despues no pudiesse dezir que\r\nno se le avia dicho antes.\" Ibid.\r\n\r\n[260] \"Dijo que pensaba estar sin casarse, porque tenia mucho escrúpulo\r\nen lo de la dispensa del Papa.\" Memorias de la Real Academia, tom. VII.\r\np. 265.\r\n\r\n[261] Ibid., p. 266.\r\n\r\n[262] \"Aunque habia recibido pena de no haberse concluido cosa que tanto\r\ndeseaba, y parecía convenir al bien público, pues á ella no le habia\r\nparecido tan necessario, y que con buena amistad se conseguiria el mismo\r\nfin, quedaba satisfecho y contento.\" Ibid., ubi supra.\r\n\r\n[263] The duke of Savoy, in a letter to Granvelle, says that the king is\r\nin arrears more than a million of crowns to the German troops alone;\r\nand, unless the ministers have some mysterious receipt for raising\r\nmoney, beyond his knowledge, Philip will be in the greatest\r\nembarrassment that any sovereign ever was. \"No ay un real y devéseles á\r\nla gente alemana, demas de lo que seles a pagado aora de la vieja deuda,\r\nmas d'un mylion d'escudos..... Por esso mirad como hazeys, que sino se\r\nhaze la paz yo veo el rey puesto en el mayor trance que rey s'a visto\r\njamas, si él no tiene otros dineros, que yo no sé, á que el señor Eraso\r\nalle algun secretto que tiene reservado para esto.\" Papiers d'Etat de\r\nGranvelle, tom. V. p. 458.\r\n\r\n[264] The minister in London was instructed to keep up the same show of\r\nconfidence to the English. \"Todavía mostramos rostro á los Franceses,\r\ncomo tambien es menester que alla se haga con los Ingleses, que no se\r\npuede confiar que no vengan Franceses á saber dellos lo que alli podrian\r\nentender.\" Ibid., p. 479.\r\n\r\n[265] Ibid., p. 468.\r\n\r\n\"That the said Dolphin's and Queen of Scott's eldest daughter shall\r\nmarry with your highnes eldest sonne, who with her shall have Callice.\"\r\nForbes, State Papers of Elizabeth, vol. I. p. 54.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to be taken for granted that Elizabeth was not to die a maiden\r\nqueen, notwithstanding her assertions so often reiterated to the\r\ncontrary.\r\n\r\n[266] \"Hablando con la reyna sin persuadirla, ny á la paz, ny á que dexe\r\nCalaix, by tampoco á que venga bien á las otras condiciones propuestas\r\npor los Franceses, paraque en ningun tiempo pueda dezir que de parte de\r\nS.

It was a war of necessity, he said, in a\r\nletter to Juan Vazquez de Molina, and Philip would stand acquitted of\r\nthe consequences before God and man.\r\n\r\n\"Pues no se puede hazer otra cosa, y el Rey se ha justificado en tantas\r\nmaneras cumpliendo con Dios y el mundo, por escusar los daños que dello\r\nse seguiran, forzado sera usar del ultimo remedio.\" Carta del Emperador\r\ná Juan Vazquez de Molina, 8 de Agosto, 1557, MS.\r\n\r\n[273] \"Il nous a semblé mieulx de leur dire rondement, que combien\r\nvostre majesté soit tousjours esté dure et difficile à recepvoir\r\npersuasions pour se remarier, que toutesfois, aiant représenté à icelle\r\nle désir du roi très-chrestien et le bien que de ce mariage pourra\r\nsuccéder, et pour plus promptement consolider ceste union et paix, elle\r\ns'estoit résolue, pour monstrer sa bonne et syncère affection, d'y\r\ncondescendre franchement.\" Granvelle, Papiers d'Etat, tom. V. p. 580.\r\n\r\n[274] \"El Conde la dijo, que aunque las negativas habían sido en cierto\r\nmodo indirectas, él no habia querido apurarla hasta el punto de decir\r\nredondamente que no, por no dar motivo à indignaciones entre dos tan\r\ngrandes Príncipes.\" Mem. de la Academia, tom. VII. p. 268.\r\n\r\n[275] \"Osservando egli l'usanza Francese nel baciar tutte l'altre Dame\r\ndi Corte, nell'arriuar alla futura sua Reina, non solo intermise quella\r\nfamigliare cerimonia, ma non uolle nè anche giamai coprirsi la testa,\r\nper istanza, che da lei ne gli fusse fatta; il che fu notato per\r\nnobilissimo, e degno atto di creäza Spagnuola.\" Campana, Filippo\r\nSecondo, parte II. lib. 11.\r\n\r\n[276] The work of extermination was to cover more ground than Henry's\r\ncapital or country, if we may take the word of the English\r\ncommissioners, who, in a letter dated January, 1559, advised the queen,\r\ntheir mistress, that \"there was an appoinctment made betwene the late\r\npope, the French king, and the king of Spaine, for the joigning of their\r\nforces together for the suppression of religion, ... th'end whereof was\r\nto constraine the rest of christiendome, being Protestants, to receive\r\nthe pope's authorité and his religione.\" (Forbes, State Papers, vol. I.\r\np. 296.) Without direct evidence of such a secret understanding,\r\nintimations of it, derived from other sources, may be found in more than\r\none passage of this history.\r\n\r\n[277] Brantôme, who repays the favors he had received from Henry the\r\nSecond by giving him a conspicuous place in his gallery of portraits,\r\neulogizes his graceful bearing in the tourney and his admirable\r\nhorsemanship.\r\n\r\n\"Mais sur tout ils l'admiroient fort en sa belle grace qu'il avoit en\r\nses armes et à cheval; comme de vray, c'estoit le prince du monde qui\r\navait la meilleure grace et la plus belle tenuë, et qui sçavoit aussi\r\nbien monstrer la vertu et bonté d'un cheval, et en cacher le vice.\"\r\nOEuvres tom.

I. p. 151.\r\n\r\n[280] This pleasing anticipation is not destined to be realised. Since\r\nthe above was written, in the summer of 1851, the cloister life of\r\nCharles the Fifth, then a virgin topic, has become a thrice-told\r\ntale,--thanks to the labors of Mr. Stirling, M. Amédée Pichot, and M.\r\nMignet; while the publication of the original documents from Simancas,\r\nby M. Gachard, will put it in the power of every scholar to verify their\r\nstatements.--See the postscript at the end of this chapter.\r\n\r\n[281] Sandoval, Hist. de Carlos V., tom. II. p. 611.\r\n\r\n[282] \"Una sola silla de caderas, que mas era media silla, tan vieja y\r\nruyn que si se pusiera en venta no dieran por ella quatro reales.\"\r\nIbid., tom. II. p. 610.--See also El Perfecto Desengaño, por el Marqués\r\nde Valparayso, MS.\r\n\r\nThe latter writer, in speaking of the furniture, uses precisely the same\r\nlanguage, with the exception of a single word, as Sandoval. Both claim\r\nto have mainly derived their account of the cloister life of Charles the\r\nFifth from the prior of Yuste, Fray Martin de Angulo. The authority,\r\ndoubtless, is of the highest value, as the prior, who witnessed the\r\nclosing scenes of Charles's life, drew up his relation for the\r\ninformation of the Regent Joanna, and at her request. Why the good\r\nfather should have presented his hero in such a poverty-stricken aspect,\r\nit is not easy to say. Perhaps he thought it would redound to the credit\r\nof the emperor, that he should have been willing to exchange the\r\nsplendors of a throne for a life of monkish mortification.\r\n\r\n[283] The reader will find an extract from the inventory of the royal\r\njewels, plate, furniture, &c, in Stirling's Cloister Life of Charles the\r\nFifth, (London, 1852,) Appendix, and in Pichot's Chronique de\r\nCharles-Quint, (Paris, 1854,) p. 537 et seq.\r\n\r\n[284] Mignet has devoted a couple of pages to an account of this\r\nremarkable picture of which an engraving is still extant, executed under\r\nthe eyes of Titian himself. Charles-Quint, pp. 214, 215.\r\n\r\n[285] Vera y Figueroa, Vida y Hechos de Carlos V., p. 127.\r\n\r\nA writer in Fraser's Magazine for April and May, 1851, has not omitted\r\nto notice this remarkable picture, in two elaborate articles on the\r\ncloister life of Charles the Fifth. They are evidently the fruit of a\r\ncareful study of the best authorities, some of them not easy of access\r\nto the English student. The author has collected some curious\r\nparticulars in respect to the persons who accompanied the emperor in his\r\nretirement; and on the whole, though he seems not to have been aware of\r\nthe active interest which Charles took in public affairs, he has\r\npresented by far the most complete view of this interesting portion of\r\nthe imperial biography that has yet been given to the world.\r\n\r\n[I suffer this note to remain as originally written, before the\r\npublication of Mr. Stirling's \"Cloister Life\" had revealed him as the\r\nauthor of these spirited essays.]\r\n\r\n[286] Sandoval, Hist. de Carlos V., tom. II. p. 610.--Siguença, Historia\r\nde la Orden de San Geronimo, (Madrid, 1595-1605,) parte III. p.\r\n190.--Ford, Handbook of Spain, (London, 1845,) p. 551.\r\n\r\nOf the above authorities, Father Siguença has furnished the best account\r\nof the emperor's little domain as it was in his day, and Ford as it is\r\nin our own.\r\n\r\n[287] See the eloquent conclusion of Stirling's Cloister Life of Charles\r\nthe Fifth.\r\n\r\nFord, in his admirable Handbook, which may serve as a manual for the\r\nstudent of Spanish in his closet, quite as well as for the traveller in\r\nSpain, has devoted a few columns to a visit which he paid to this\r\nsequestered spot, where, as he says, the spirit of the mighty dead\r\nseemed to rule again in his last home. A few lines from the pages of the\r\nEnglish tourist will bring the scene more vividly before the reader than\r\nthe colder description in the text. \"As the windows were thrown wide\r\nopen to admit the cool thyme-scented breeze, the eye in the clear\r\nevening swept over the boundless valley; and the nightingales sang\r\nsweetly, in the neglected orange-garden, to the bright stars reflected\r\nlike diamonds in the black tank below us. How often had Charles looked\r\nout, on a stilly eve, on this selfsame and unchanged scene, where he\r\nalone was now wanting!\" Handbook of Spain, p. 553.\r\n\r\n[288] Carta de Martin de Gaztelu al Secretario Vazquez, 5 de Febrero,\r\n1557, MS.\r\n\r\n[289] Their names and vocations are specified in the codicil executed by\r\nCharles a few days before his death. See the document entire, ap.\r\nSandoval, Hist. de Carlos V., tom. II. p. 662.\r\n\r\nA more satisfactory list has been made out by the indefatigable Gachard\r\nfrom various documents which he collected, and which have furnished him\r\nwith the means of correcting the orthography of Sandoval, miserably\r\ndeficient in respect to Flemish names. See Retraite et Mort de\r\nCharles-Quint, tom. I. p. 1.\r\n\r\n[290] \"Las vistas de las pieças de su magestad no son muy largas, sino\r\ncortas, y las que se véen, o es una montaña de piedras grandes, ó unos\r\nmontes de robles no muy altos.

Siguença was prior of the Escorial; and in that\r\npalace-monastery of the Jeronymites he must have had the means of\r\ncontinually conversing with several of his brethren who had been with\r\nCharles in his retirement. His work, which appeared at the beginning of\r\nthe following century, has become rare,--so rare that M. Gachard was\r\nobliged to content himself with a few manuscript extracts, from the\r\ndifficulty of procuring the printed original. I was fortunate enough to\r\nobtain a copy, and a very fine one, through my booksellers, Messrs.\r\nRich, Brothers, London,--worthy sons of a sire who for thirty years or\r\nmore stood preëminent for sagacity and diligence among the collectors of\r\nrare and valuable books.\r\n\r\n[298] \"Mandò pregonar en los lugares comarcanos que so pena de cien\r\naçotes muger alguna no passasse de un humilladero que estasa como dos\r\ntiros de ballesta del Monasterio.\" Sandoval, Hist. de Carlos V., tom.\r\nII. p. 612; and Sandoval's _double_, Valparayso, El Perfecto Desengaño,\r\nMS.\r\n\r\n[299] \"Si alguno se errava dezía consigo mismo: O _hideputa bermejo_,\r\nque aquel erro, ò otro nombre semejante.\" Sandoval, Hist. de Carlos V.,\r\ntom.

It is but fair to state that the author of\r\nthe Perfecto Desengaño puts no such irreverent expression into Charles's\r\nmouth. Both, however, profess to follow the MS. of the Prior Angulo.\r\n\r\n[300] \"Non aspernatur exercitationes campestres, in quem usum paratam\r\nhabet tormentariam rhedam, ad essedi speciem, præcellenti arte, et miro\r\nstudio proximis hisce mensibus a se constructam.\" Lettres sur la Vie\r\nIntérieure de l'Empereur Charles-Quint, écrites par Guillaume van Male,\r\ngentilhomme de sa chambre, et publiées, pour la première fois, par le\r\nBaron de Reiffenberg, (Bruxelles, 1843, 4to,) ep. 8.\r\n\r\n[301] \"Interdum ligneos passerculos emisit cubículo volantes\r\nrevolantesque.\" Strada, De Bello Belgico, tom.

Mignet, Charles-Quint, p. 279.\r\n\r\nIt is singular that this interesting letter is neither in M.

(Carta\r\ndel Emperador al Rey, 31 de Marzo, 1558, MS.) But a full account of the\r\nPortuguese mission is given by Cienfuegos, Vida de S. Francisco de\r\nBorja, (Barcelona, 1754,) p. 269. The person employed by Charles in this\r\ndelicate business was no other than his friend Francisco Borja, the\r\nex-duke of Gandia, who, like himself, had sought a retreat from the\r\nworld in the shades of the cloister. The biographers who record the\r\nmiracles and miraculous virtues of the sainted Jesuit, bestow several\r\nchapters on his visits to Yuste. His conversations with the emperor are\r\nreported with a minuteness that Boswell might have envied, and which may\r\nwell provoke our scepticism, unless we suppose them to have been\r\nreported by Borja himself. One topic much discussed in them was the\r\nmerits of the order which the emperor's friend had entered. It had not\r\nthen risen to that eminence which, under its singular discipline, it\r\nsubsequently reached; and Charles would fain have persuaded his visitor\r\nto abandon it for the Jeronymite society with which he was established.\r\nBut Borja seems to have silenced, if not satisfied, his royal master, by\r\narguments which prove that his acute mind already discerned the germ of\r\nfuture greatness in the institutions of the new order.--Ibid., pp.\r\n273-279.--Ribadeneira, Vita Francisci Borgiæ, (Lat. trans., Antverpiæ,\r\n1598,) p. 110 et seq.\r\n\r\n[318] Carta del Emperador al Rey, 25 de Mayo, 1558, MS.\r\n\r\nOn the margin of this letter we find the following memoranda of Philip\r\nhimself, showing how much importance he attached to his father's\r\ninterposition in this matter. \"Volvérselo a suplicar con gran instancia,\r\npues quedamos in tales términos que, si me ayudan con dinero, los\r\npodríamos atraer à lo que conviniesse.\" \"Besalle las manos por lo que en\r\nesto ha mandado y suplicalle lo lleve adelante y que de acá se hará lo\r\nmismo, y avisarle de lo que se han hecho hasta agora.\"\r\n\r\n[319] Carta del Emperador á Juan Vazquez, 31 de Marzo, 1557, MS.\r\n\r\n[320] Carta del Emperador á la Princesa, 31 de Marzo, 1557, MS.--The\r\nwhole letter is singularly characteristic of Charles. Its authoritative\r\ntone shows that, though he had parted with the crown, he had not parted\r\nwith the temper of a sovereign, and of an absolute sovereign too.\r\n\r\n[321] \"Es tal su indignacion y tan sangrientas las palabras y vehemencia\r\ncon que manda escribir á v.m. que me disculpará sino lo hago con mas\r\ntemplança y modo.\" Carta de Martin de Gaztelu á Juan Vazquez, 12 de\r\nMayo, 1557, MS.\r\n\r\n[322] \"His majesty was so well,\" writes Gaztelu, early in the summer of\r\n1557, \"that he could rise from his seat, and support his arquebuse,\r\nwithout aid.\" He could even do some mischief with his fowling-piece to\r\nthe wood-pigeons. Carta de Gaztelu, á Vazquez, 5 de Junio, 1557, MS.\r\n\r\n[323] \"Porque desde tantos de noviembre hasta pocos dias hame ha dado\r\n[la gota] tres vezes y muy rezio, y me ha tenido muchos días en la cama,\r\ny hestado hasta de poco acá tan trabajado y flaco que en toda esta\r\nquaresma no he podido oyr un sermon, y esto es la causa porque no os\r\nescribo esta de mi mano.\" Carta del Emperador al Rey, 7 de Abril, 1558,\r\nMS.\r\n\r\n[324] \"Sintiólo cierto mucho, y se le arrasáron los ojos, y me dijo lo\r\nmucho que él y la de Francia se habian siempre querido, y por cuan buena\r\ncristiana la tenia, y que le llevaba quince meses de tiempo, y que,\r\nsegún él se iba sintiendo, de poco acá podria ser que dentro de ellos le\r\nhiciese compañía.\" Carta de Gaztelu á Vazquez, 21 de Febrero, 1558, ap.\r\nGachard, Retraite et Mort, tom.

The author of the MS. discovered by M. Bakhuizen,\r\nnoticed more fully in the next note, though present at the ceremony,\r\ncontents himself with a general outline of it. Siguença, who follows\r\nnext in time and in authority, tells us of the lighted candle which\r\nCharles delivered to the priest. Strada, who wrote a generation later,\r\nconcludes the scene by leaving the emperor in a swoon upon the floor.\r\nLastly, Robertson, after making the emperor perform in his shroud, lays\r\nhim in his coffin, where, after joining in the prayers for the rest of\r\nhis own soul, not yet departed, he is left by the monks to his\r\nmeditations!--Where Robertson got all these particulars it would not be\r\neasy to tell; certainly not from the authorities cited at the bottom of\r\nhis page.\r\n\r\n[328] \"Et j'assure que le coeur nous fendait de voir qu'un homme voulût\r\nen quelque sorte s'enterrer vivant, et faire ses obsèques avant de\r\nmourir.\" Gachard, Retraite et Mort, tom. I. p lvi.\r\n\r\nM. Gachard has given a translation of the chapter relating to the\r\nfuneral, from a curious MS. account of Charles's convent life,\r\ndiscovered by M. Bakhuizen in the archives at Brussels. As the author\r\nwas one of the brotherhood who occupied the convent at the time of the\r\nemperor's residence there, the MS. is stamped with the highest\r\nauthority; and M. Gachard will doubtless do a good service to letters by\r\nincorporating it in the second volume of his \"Retraite et Mort.\"\r\n\r\n[329] Siguença, Hist. de la Orden de San Geronimo, parte III. pp. 200,\r\n201.\r\n\r\nSiguença's work, which combines much curious learning with a simple\r\nelegance of style, was the fruit of many years of labor. The third\r\nvolume, containing the part relating to the emperor, appeared in 1605,\r\nthe year before the death of its author, who, as already noticed, must\r\nhave had daily communication with several of the monks, when, after\r\nCharles's death, they had been transferred from Yuste to the gloomy\r\nshades of the Escorial.\r\n\r\n[330] Such, for example, were Vera y Figueroa, Conde de la Roca, whose\r\nlittle volume appeared in 1613; Strada, who wrote some twenty years\r\nlater; and the marquis of Valparayso, whose MS. is dated 1638. I say\r\nnothing of Sandoval, often quoted as authority for the funeral, for, as\r\nhe tells us that the money which the emperor proposed to devote to a\r\nmock funeral was after all appropriated to his real one, it would seem\r\nto imply that the former never took place.\r\n\r\nIt were greatly to be wished that the MS. of Fray Martin de Angulo could\r\nbe detected and brought to light. As prior of Yuste while Charles was\r\nthere, his testimony would be invaluable. Both Sandoval and the marquis\r\nof Valparayso profess to have relied mainly on Angulo's authority. Yet\r\nin this very affair of the funeral they disagree.\r\n\r\n[331] Siguença's composition may be characterized as _simplex\r\nmunditiis_. The MS. of the monk of Yuste, found in Brussels, is stamped,\r\nsays M. Gachard, with the character of simplicity and truth. Retraite et\r\nMort, tom.

A few\r\nweeks after her father's death she caused a letter to be addressed to\r\nthe major-domo, asking him directly if this were the case, and\r\nintimating a desire to make a suitable provision for the youth. The wary\r\nfunctionary, who tells this in his private correspondence with Philip,\r\nendeavored to put the regent off the scent by stating that the lad was\r\nthe son of a friend, and that, as no allusion had been made to him in\r\nthe emperor's will, there could be no foundation for the rumor. \"Ser\r\nansy que yo tenya un muchacho de hun caballero amygo myo que me abia\r\nencomendado años a, y que pues S.

Perhaps the\r\nreader will excuse, as germaine to this matter, a short sketch relating\r\nto it, from one of my letters written on the spot to a distant friend:--\r\n\r\n\"Then the noble cathedral of Brussels, dedicated to one Saint\r\nGudule,--the superb organ filling its long aisles with the most\r\nheart-thrilling tones, as the voices of the priests, dressed in their\r\nrich robes of purple and gold, rose in a chant that died away in the\r\nimmense vaulted distance of the cathedral. It was the service of the\r\ndead, and the coffin of some wealthy burgher probably, to judge from its\r\ndecorations, was in the choir. A number of persons were kneeling and\r\nsaying their prayers in rapt attention, little heeding the Protestant\r\nstrangers who were curiously gazing at the pictures and statues with\r\nwhich the edifice was filled. I was most struck with one poor woman, who\r\nwas kneeling before the shrine of the saint, whose marble corpse,\r\ncovered by a decent white gauze veil, lay just before her, separated\r\nonly by a light railing. The setting sun was streaming in through the\r\nrich colored panes of the magnificent windows, that rose from the floor\r\nto the ceiling of the cathedral, some hundred feet in height. The glass\r\nwas of the time of Charles the Fifth, and I soon recognized his familiar\r\nface,--the protruding jaw of the Austrian line. As I heard the glorious\r\nanthem rise up to heaven in this time-honored cathedral, which had\r\nwitnessed generation after generation melt away, and which now\r\ndisplayed, in undying colors, the effigies of those who had once\r\nworshipped within its walls, I was swept back to a distant period, and\r\nfelt I was a contemporary of the grand old times when Charles the Fifth\r\nheld the chapters of the Golden Fleece in this very building.\"\r\n\r\n[347] \"De Rege vero Cæsare ajunt, qui ab eo veniunt, barbatum jam esse.\"\r\nPetri Martyris Opus Epistolarum, (Amstelodami, 1670, fol.,) ep. 734.\r\n\r\n[348] In this outline of the character of Charles the Fifth, I have not\r\nhesitated to avail myself of the masterly touches which Ranke has given\r\nto the portrait of this monarch, in the introduction to that portion of\r\nhis great work on the nations of Southern Europe which he has devoted to\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\n[349] \"Qualche fiate io son fermo in le cattive.\" Contarini, cited by\r\nRanke, Ottoman and Spanish Empires, p. 29.\r\n\r\n[350] See Bradford, Correspondence of the Emperor Charles the Fifth and\r\nhis Ambassadors at the Courts of England and France, with a connecting\r\nNarrative and Biographical Notices of the Emperor, (London, 1850,) p.\r\n367,--a work which contains some interesting particulars, little known,\r\nrespecting Charles the Fifth.\r\n\r\n[351] \"Nel mangiare ha S.

But he remembered enough of their\r\ncontents, he said, to make out another life of his master, which he\r\nintended to do. (Papiers d'Etat de Granvelle, tom. VI. p. 29.) Philip,\r\nthinking that Van Male might have carried his intention into execution,\r\nordered Granvelle to hunt among his papers, after the poor gentleman's\r\ndeath, and if he found any such MS. to send it to him, that he might\r\nthrow it into the fire! (Ibid., p. 273.) Philip, in his tenderness for\r\nhis father's memory, may have thought that no man could be a hero to his\r\nown valet-de-chambre. On searching, however, no memoirs were found.\r\n\r\n[359] \"Bono jure, ait, fructus ille ad Gulielmum redeat, ut qui plurimum\r\nin opere illo sudarit.\" Ibid., ep. 6.\r\n\r\n[360] \"Ne in proemio quidem passus est ullam solertiæ suæ laudem\r\nadscribí.\" Ibid.\r\n\r\nVan Male's Latin correspondence, from which this amusing incident is\r\ntaken, was first published by the Baron Reiffenberg for the society of\r\n_Bibliophiles Belgiques_, at Brussels, in 1843. It contains some\r\ninteresting notices of Charles the Fifth's personal habits during the\r\nfive years preceding his abdication. Van Male accompanied his master\r\ninto his retirement; and his name appears in the codicil, among those of\r\nthe household who received pensions from the emperor. This doubtless\r\nstood him in more stead than his majesty's translation, which, although\r\nit passed through several editions in the course of the century,\r\nprobably put little money into the pocket of the chamberlain, who died\r\nin less than two years after his master.\r\n\r\nA limited edition only of Van Male's correspondence was printed, for the\r\nbenefit of the members of the association. For the copy used by me, I am\r\nindebted to Mr. Van de Weyer, the accomplished Belgian minister at the\r\nEnglish court, whose love of letters is shown not more by the library he\r\nhas formed--one of the noblest private collections in Europe--than by\r\nthe liberality with which he accords the use of it to the student.\r\n\r\n[361] Paulo Giovio got so little in return for his honeyed words, that\r\nhis eyes were opened to a new trait in the character of Charles, whom he\r\nafterwards stigmatized as parsimonious. See Sepulveda, De Rebus Gestis\r\nCaroli V., lib. XXX. p. 534.\r\n\r\n[362] \"Haud mihi gratum est legere vel audire quæ de me scribuntur;\r\nlegent alii cum ipse a vita discessero; tu siquid ex me scire cupis,\r\npercunctare, nec enim respondere gravabor.\" Ibid., p. 533.\r\n\r\n[363] Charles, however willing he might be to receive those strangers\r\nwho brought him news from foreign parts, was not very tolerant, as the\r\nhistorian tells us, of visits of idle ceremony.

The\r\nletter shows, too, that Granvelle, if possessed naturally of a more\r\ntolerant spirit than Philip, could accommodate himself so far to the\r\nopposite temper of his master as to furnish him with some very plausible\r\ngrounds for persecution.

The good Father Levesque made but a very indifferent use of the\r\nrich store of materials placed at his disposal, by digesting them into\r\ntwo duodecimo volumes, in which the little that is of value seems to\r\nhave been pilfered from the unpublished MS. of a previous biographer of\r\nthe Cardinal. The work of the Benedictine, however, has the merit of\r\nauthenticity. I shall take occasion, hereafter, to give a more\r\nparticular account of the Granvelle collection.\r\n\r\n[427] \"En considération des bons, léaux, notables et agréables services\r\nfaits par lui, pendant plusieurs années, à feu l'Empereur, et depuis au\r\nRoi.\" Correspondance de Philippe II, tom.

The story was originally\r\nderived from Aubéri (loc. cit.). The chronicler had it, as he tells us,\r\nfrom his father, to whom it was told by an intimate friend of the prince\r\nof Orange, who was present at the scene.

According to them, a regular _dépôt_ was established at Medina\r\ndel Campo and Seville, for the sale of the forbidden books at very low\r\nrates. \"De las imprentas de Alemania se despachaban á Flandes, y desde\r\nalli á España, al principio por los puertos de mar, y después cuando ya\r\nhubo mas vigilancia de parte del gobierno, los enviaban á Leon de\r\nFrancia desde donde se introducían en la península por Navarra y Aragon.\r\nUn tal Vilman librero de Amberes tenia tienda en Medina del Campo y en\r\nSevilla donde vendia las obras de los protestantes en español y latin.\r\nEstos libros de Francfort se daban á buen mercado para que circulasen\r\ncon mayor facilidad.\" Documentos Inéditos, tom.

(Sermones Funerales, en las Honras del Rey\r\nDon Felipe II., fol. 77.) Colmenares still more emphatically eulogizes\r\nthe words thus uttered in the cause of the true faith, as worthy of such\r\na prince. \"El primer sentenciado al fuego en este Auto fué Don Carlos de\r\nSeso de sangre noble, que osó dezir al Rey, como consentia que le\r\nquemasen, y severo respondio, Yo trahere la leña para quemar á mi hijo,\r\nsi fuere tan malo como vos.

V. cap. 3.\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted whether the historian means anything more than that\r\nPhilip saw the unfortunate man led to execution, at which his own guards\r\nassisted. Dávila, the friar who, as I have noticed, pronounced a funeral\r\noration on the king, speaks of him simply as having assisted at this act\r\nof faith,--\"Assistir a los actos de Fe, como se vio en esta Ciudad.\"\r\n(Sermones Funerales, fol. 77.) Could the worthy father have ventured to\r\ngive Philip credit for being present at the death, he would not have\r\nfailed to do so. Leti, less scrupulous, tells us that Philip saw the\r\nexecution from the windows of his palace, heard the cries of the dying\r\nmartyrs, and enjoyed the spectacle! The picture he gives of the scene\r\nloses nothing for want of coloring. Vita di Filippo II., tom. I. p. 342.\r\n\r\n[450] How little sympathy, may be inferred from the savage satisfaction\r\nwith which a wise and temperate historian at the time dismisses to\r\neverlasting punishment one of the martyrs at the first _auto_ at\r\nValladolid. \"Jureque vivus flammis corpore cruciatus miserrimam animam\r\nefflavit ad supplicia sempiterna.\" Sepulveda, Opera, tom. III. p. 58.\r\n\r\n[451] Balmes, one of the most successful champions of the Romish faith\r\nin our time, finds in the terrible apathy thus shown to the sufferings\r\nof the martyrs a proof of a more vital religious sentiment than exists\r\nat the present day! \"We feel our hair grow stiff on our heads at the\r\nmere idea of burning a man alive. Placed in society where the religious\r\nsentiment is considerably diminished; accustomed to live among men who\r\nhave a different religion, and sometimes none at all; we cannot bring\r\nourselves to believe that it could be, at that time, quite an ordinary\r\nthing to see heretics or the impious led to punishment.\" Protestantism\r\nand Catholicity compared in their Effects on the Civilization of Europe,\r\nEng. trans., (Baltimore, 1851,) p. 217.\r\n\r\nAccording to this view of the matter, the more religion there is among\r\nmen, the harder will be their hearts.\r\n\r\n[452] The zeal of the king and the Inquisition together in the work of\r\npersecution had wellnigh got the nation into more than one difficulty\r\nwith foreign countries. Mann, the English minister, was obliged to\r\nremonstrate against the manner in which the independence of his own\r\nhousehold was violated by the agents of the Holy Office. The complaints\r\nof St. Sulpice, the French ambassador, notwithstanding the gravity of\r\nthe subject, are told in a vein of caustic humor that may provoke a\r\nsmile in the reader: \"I have complained to the king of the manner in\r\nwhich the Marseillese, and other Frenchmen, are maltreated by the\r\nInquisition. He excused himself by saying that he had little power or\r\nauthority in matters which depended on that body; he could do nothing\r\nfurther than recommend the grand-inquisitor to cause good and speedy\r\njustice to be done to the parties. The grand-inquisitor promised that\r\nthey should be treated no worse than born Castilians, and the 'good and\r\nspeedy justice'came to this, that they were burnt alive in the king's\r\npresence.\" Raumer, Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries, vol. I. p. 111.\r\n\r\n[453] The archbishop of Toledo, according to Lucio Marineo Siculo, who\r\nwrote a few years before this period, had jurisdiction over more than\r\nfifteen large towns, besides smaller places, which of course made the\r\nnumber of his vassals enormous. His revenues also, amounting to eighty\r\nthousand ducats, exceeded those of any grandee in the kingdom. The\r\nyearly revenues of the subordinate beneficiaries of his church were\r\ntogether not less than a hundred and eighty thousand ducats.

III. p. 218 et\r\nseq.\r\n\r\n[457] The persecution of Carranza has occupied the pens of several\r\nCastilian writers. The most ample biographical notice of him is by the\r\nDoctor Salazar de Miranda, who derived his careful and trustworthy\r\nnarrative from the best original sources. Llorente had the advantage of\r\naccess to the voluminous records of the Holy Office, of which he was the\r\nsecretary; and in his third volume he has devoted a large space to the\r\nprocess of Carranza which, with the whole mass of legal documents\r\ngrowing out of the protracted prosecution, amounted, as he assures us,\r\nto no less than twenty-six thousand leaves of manuscript. This enormous\r\nmass of testimony leads one to suspect that the object of the\r\nInquisition was not so much to detect the truth as to cover it up. The\r\nlearned editors of the \"Documentos Inéditos\" have profited by both these\r\nworks, as well as by some unpublished manuscripts of that day, relating\r\nto the affair, to exhibit it fully and fairly to the Castilian reader,\r\nwho in this brief history may learn the value of the institutions under\r\nwhich his fathers lived.\r\n\r\n[458] So says McCrie, whose volume on the Reformation in Spain presents\r\nin a reasonable compass a very accurate view of that interesting\r\nmovement. The historian does not appear to have had access to any rare\r\nor recondite materials; but he has profited well by those at his\r\ncommand, comprehending the best published works, and has digested them\r\ninto a narrative distinguished for its temperance and truth.\r\n\r\n[459] A full account of this duke of Infantado is to be found in the\r\nextremely rare work of Nuñez de Castro, Historia Ecclesiastica y Seglar\r\nde Guadalajara, (Madrid, 1653,) p. 180 et seq. Oviedo, in his curious\r\nvolumes on the Castilian aristocracy, which he brings down to 1556,\r\nspeaks of the dukes of Infantado as having a body-guard of two hundred\r\nmen, and of being able to muster a force of thirty thousand!\r\nQuincuagenas, MS.\r\n\r\n[460] \"Avia gualdrapas de dos mil ducados de costa sin conputar valor de\r\npiedras.\" Cabrera, Filipe Segundo, lib. V. cap. 7.\r\n\r\n[461] \"Elle répondit d'un air riant, et avec des termes pleins tout\r\nensemble de douceur et de majesté.\" De Thou, tom. III. p. 426.\r\n\r\n[462] We have a minute account of this interview from the pens of two of\r\nIsabella's train, who accompanied her to Castile, and whose letters to\r\nthe cardinal of Lorraine are to be found in the valuable collection of\r\nhistorical documents, the publication of which was begun under the\r\nauspices of Louis Philippe. Documents Inédits sur l'Histoire de France,\r\nNégociations etc. relatives au Règne de François II., p. 171 et seq.\r\n\r\n[463] Lucio Marineo, in his curious farrago of notable matters, speaks\r\nof the sumptuous residence of the dukes of Infantado in Guadalajara.\r\n\"Los muy magníficos y sumpticosos palacios que alli estan de los muy\r\nillustres duques de la casa muy antigua de los Mendoças.\" Cosas\r\nMemorables, fol. 13.\r\n\r\n[464] \"J'ay ouy conter à une de ses dames que la premiere fois qu'elle\r\nvist son mary, elle se mit à le contempler si fixement, que le Roy, ne\r\nle trouvant pas bon, luy demanda: _Que mirais, si tengo canas?_\r\nc'est-à-dire, 'Que regardez-vous, si j'ai les cheveux blancs?'Ces mots\r\nluy toucherent si fort au coeur que depuis on augura mal pour elle.\"\r\nBrantôme, OEuvres, tom. V. p. 131.\r\n\r\n[465] In this statement I conform to Sismondi's account. In the present\r\ninstance, however, there is even more uncertainty than is usual in\r\nregard to a lady's age. According to Cabrera, Isabella was eighteen at\r\nthe time of her marriage; while De Thou makes her only eleven when the\r\nterms of the alliance were arranged by the commissioners at\r\nCateau-Cambresis. These are the extremes, but within them there is no\r\nagreement amongst the authorities I have consulted.\r\n\r\n[466] \"Elizabeth de France, et vraye fille de France, en tout belle,\r\nsage, vertueuse, spirituelle et bonne, s'il en fust oncques.\" Brantôme,\r\nOEuvres, tom.

I. p. 345.\r\n\r\n[470] Brantôme, who was certainly one of those who believed in the\r\njealousy of Philip, if not in the passion of Isabella, states the\r\ncircumstance of the king's supplanting his son in a manner sufficiently\r\n_naïve_. \"Mais le roy d'Espagne son pere, venant à estre veuf par le\r\ntrespas de la reyne d'Angleterre sa femme et sa cousine germaine, ayant\r\nveu le pourtraict de madame Elizabeth, et la trouvant fort belle et fort\r\nà son gré, en coupa l'herbe soubs le pied à son fils, et la prit pour\r\nluy, commençant cette charité à soy mesme.\" OEuvres, tom.

In this\r\n_epithalamium_, if it may be so called, the poet represents Juno as\r\ninvoking Jupiter to interfere in behalf of the French monarchy, that it\r\nmay not be crushed by the arms of Spain. Venus, under the form of the\r\nduke of Alva,--as effectual a disguise as could be imagined,--takes her\r\nseat in the royal council, and implores Philip to admit France to terms,\r\nand to accept the hand of Isabella as the pledge of peace between the\r\nnations. Philip graciously relents; peace is proclaimed; the marriage\r\nbetween the parties is solemnized, with the proper Christian rites; and\r\nVenus appears, in her own proper shape, to bless the nuptials! One might\r\nhave feared that this jumble of Christian rites and heathen mythology\r\nwould have scandalized the Holy Office, and exposed its ingenious author\r\nto the honors of a _san benito_. But the poet wore his laurels\r\nunscathed, and, for aught I know to the contrary, died quietly in his\r\nbed. See Opera Ferdinandi Ruizii Villegatis, (Venetiis, 1736,) pp.\r\n30-70.\r\n\r\n[475] The sovereign remedy, according to the curious Brantôme, was\r\nnew-laid eggs. It is a pity the prescription should be lost. \"On luy\r\nsecourust son visage si bien par des sueurs d'oeufs frais, chose fort\r\npropre pour cela, qu'il n'y parut rien; dont j'en vis la Reyne sa mere\r\nfort curieuse à luy envoyer par force couriers beaucoup de remedes, mais\r\ncelui de la sueur d'oeuf en estoit le souverain.\" OEuvres, tom. V. p. 129.\r\n\r\n[476] \"Aussi l'appelloit-on _la Reyna de la paz y de la bondad_,\r\nc'est-à-dire la Reyne de la paix et de la bonté; et nos François\r\nl'appelloient l'olive de paix.\" Ibid., ubi supra.\r\n\r\n[477] \"Et bien heureux et heureuse estoit celuy ou celle qui pouvoit le\r\nsoir dire 'J'ay veu la Reyne.'\" Ibid., ubi supra.\r\n\r\n[478] The difficulty began so soon as Isabella had crossed the borders.\r\nThe countess of Ureña, sister of the duke of Albuquerque, one of the\r\ntrain of the duke of Infantado, claimed precedence of the countess of\r\nRieux and Mademoiselle de Montpensier, kinswomen of the queen. The\r\nlatter would have averted the discussion by giving the Castilian dame a\r\nseat in her carriage; but the haughty countess chose to take the affair\r\ninto her own hands; and her servants came into collision with those of\r\nthe French ladies, as they endeavored to secure a place for their\r\nmistress's litter near the queen. Isabella, with all her desire to\r\naccommodate matters, had the spirit to decide in favor of her own\r\nfollowers, and the aspiring lady was compelled--with an ill grace--to\r\ngive way to the blood royal of France. It was easier, as Isabella, or\r\nrather as her husband, afterwards found, to settle disputes between\r\nrival states than between the rival beauties of a court. The affair is\r\ntold by Lansac, Négociations relatives au Règne de François II., p. 171.\r\n\r\n[479] \"Elle ne porta jamais une robe deux fois, et puis la donnoit à ses\r\nfemmes et ses filles: et Dieu sçait quelles robbes, si riches et si\r\nsuperbes, que la moindre estoit de trois ou quatre cens escus; car le\r\nRoy son mary l'entretenoit fort superbement de ces choses là.\" Brantôme,\r\nOEuvres, tom.

The picture, by the hand of a\r\ncontemporary, affords so striking a contrast to the present time that it\r\nis worth quoting. \"Corren por ella los ayres muy delgados: por los\r\nquales si[=e]pre bive la g[=e]te muy sana. Tiene mas este lugar gr[=a]des\r\ntérminos y campos muy fertiles: los quales llam[=a] lomos de Madrid.

Groen Van Prinsterer has taken some pains to explain the\r\nconduct of William's parents, on the ground, chiefly, that they had\r\nreason to think their son, after all, might he allowed to worship\r\naccording to the way in which he had been educated (p. 195). But\r\nwhatever concessions to the Protestants may have been wrung from Charles\r\nby considerations of public policy, we suspect few who have studied his\r\ncharacter will believe that he would ever have consented to allow one of\r\nhis own household, one to whom he stood in the relation of a guardian,\r\nto be nurtured in the faith of heretics.\r\n\r\n[498] See particularly Margaret's letter to the king, of March 13, 1560,\r\nCorrespondance de Marguerite d'Autriche, p. 260 et seq.\r\n\r\n[499] M.

(Van der Haer, De\r\nInitiis Tumult., p. 182, ap. Archives de la Maison d'Orange-Nassau, tom.\r\nI. p. 200*.)

If Margaret could not\r\ndo better, she might enter into negotiations with the malecontents on\r\nthe subject; but she should take care to delay sending advice of it to\r\nSpain; and the king, on his part, would delay as long as possible\r\nreturning his answers.

(Mémoires de Granvelle,\r\ntom. II. p. 52.) The worthy Benedictine assures us, in his preface, that\r\nhe has always given the text of Granvelle's correspondence exactly as he\r\nfound it; an assurance to which few will give implicit credit who have\r\nread this letter, which bears the marks of the reviser's hand in every\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n[584] Mémoires de Granvelle, tom.

Gachard,\r\nobtained some clew to the existence of such a letter in the Archives of\r\nSimancas. For two months it eluded his researches, when in a happy hour\r\nhe stumbled on this pearl of price. The reader may share the enthusiasm\r\nof the Belgian scholar. \"Je redoublai d'attention; et enfin, après deux\r\nmois de travail, je découvris, sur un petit chiffon de papier, la minute\r\nde la fameuse lettre dont faisait mention la duchesse de Parme: elle\r\navait été classée, par une méprise de je ne sais quel officiai, avec les\r\npapiers de l'année 1562. On lisait en tête: _De mano del Rey; secreta._\r\nVous comprendrez, monsieur le Ministre, la joie que me fit éprouver\r\ncette découverte: ce sont là des jouissances qui dédommagent de bien des\r\nfatigues, de bien des ennuis!\" Rapport à M. le Ministre de l'Intérieur,\r\nIbid., p. clxxxv.\r\n\r\n[589] \"M'esbayz bien que, pour chose quelconque, vous ayez délaissé\r\nd'entrer au conseil où je vous avois laissé.\" Correspondance de\r\nGuillaume le Taciturne tom.

These letters were of directly opposite tenor; one dispensing\r\nwith Egmont's presence at Madrid,--which had been talked of,--the other\r\ninviting him there. Margaret was to give the one which, under the\r\ncircumstances, she thought expedient. The duchess was greatly distressed\r\nby her brother's manoeuvring. She saw that the course she must pursue was\r\nnot the course which he would prefer. Philip did not understand her\r\ncountrymen so well as she did.\r\n\r\n[592] \"En effet, le prince d'Orange et le comte d'Egmont, les seuls qui\r\nse trouvassent à Bruxelles, montrèrent tant de tristesse et de\r\nmécontentement de la courte et sèche réponse du Roi, qu'il était à\r\ncraindre qu'après qu'elle aurait été communiquée aux autres seigneurs,\r\nil ne fût pris quelque résolution contraire au service du Roi.\"\r\nCorrespondance de Philippe II., tom. I. p. 294.\r\n\r\n[593] \"Con la venida de Mons. de Chantonnay, mi hermano, á Bruxelles, y\r\nsu determinacion de encaminarse á estas partes, me paresció tomar color\r\nde venir hazia acá, donde no havia estado en 19 años, y ver á madama de\r\nGranvella, mi madre, que ha 14 que no la havia visto.\" Ibid., p. 298.\r\n\r\nGranvelle seems to have fondly trusted that no one but Margaret was\r\nprivy to the existence of the royal letter,--\"secret, and written with\r\nthe king's own hand.\" So he speaks of his departure in his various\r\nletters as a spontaneous movement to see his venerable parent. The\r\nsecretary Perez must have smiled, as he read one of these letters to\r\nhimself, since an abstract of the royal despatch appears in his own\r\nhandwriting. The Flemish nobles also--probably through the regent's\r\nsecretary, Armenteros--appear to have been possessed of the true state\r\nof the case. It was too good a thing to be kept secret.\r\n\r\n[594] Schiller, Abfall der Niederlande, p. 147.\r\n\r\nAmong other freaks was that of a masquerade, at which a devil was seen\r\npursuing a cardinal with a scourge of foxes'tails. \"Deinde sequebatur\r\ndiabolus, equum dicti cardinalis caudis vulpinis fustigans, magna cum\r\ntotius populi admiratione et scandalo.\" (Papiers d'Etat de Granvelle,\r\ntom. VIII. p. 77.) The fox's tail was a punning allusion to Renard, who\r\ntook a most active and venomous part in the paper war that opened the\r\nrevolution. Renard, it may be remembered, was the imperial minister to\r\nEngland in Queen Mary's time. He was the implacable enemy of Granvelle,\r\nwho had once been his benefactor.\r\n\r\n[595] Strada, De Bello Belgico, pp. 161-164.--Vander Haer, De Initiis\r\nTumultuum Belgicorum, p. 166.--Vandervynckt, Troubles des Pays-Bas, tom.\r\nII. p. 53.--Correspondance de Philippe II., tom. I. pp. 294, 295.\r\n\r\n[596] The date is given by the prince of Orange in a letter to the\r\nlandgrave of Hesse, written a fortnight after the cardinal's departure.\r\n(Archives de la Maison d'Orange-Nassau, tom. I. p. 226.) This fact,\r\npublic and notorious as it was, is nevertheless told with the greatest\r\ndiscrepancy of dates. Hopper, one of Granvelle's own friends, fixes the\r\ndate of his departure at the latter end of May. (Recueil et Mémorial, p.\r\n36.) Such discrepancies will not seem strange to the student of history.\r\n\r\n[597] \"Ejus inimici, qui in senatu erant, non aliter exultavêre quam\r\npueri abeunte ludimagistro.\" Vita Viglii, p. 38.\r\n\r\nHoogstraten and Brederode indulged their wild humor, as they saw the\r\ncardinal leaving Brussels, by mounting a horse,--one in the saddle, the\r\nother _en croupe_,--and in this way, muffled in their cloaks,\r\naccompanying the traveller along the heights for half a league or more.\r\nGranvelle tells the story himself, in a letter to Margaret, but\r\ndismisses it as the madcap frolic of young men.

See Vita Viglii, p. 40.\r\n\r\n[617] The extortions of Margaret's secretary, who was said to have\r\namassed a fortune of seventy thousand ducats in her service, led the\r\npeople, instead of Armenteros, punningly to call him _Argenterios_. This\r\npiece of scandal is communicated for the royal ear in a letter addressed\r\nto one of the king's secretaries by Fray Lorenzo de Villacancio, of whom\r\nI shall give a full account elsewhere. Gachard, Correspondance de\r\nPhilippe II., tom. II., Rapport, p. xliii.\r\n\r\n[618] Archives de la Maison d'Orange-Nassau, tom. I., p. 273 et alibi.\r\n\r\n[619] Granvelle regarded such a step as the only effectual remedy for\r\nthe disorders in the Low Countries. In a remarkable letter to Philip,\r\ndated July 20, 1565, he presents such a view of the manner in which the\r\ngovernment is conducted as might well alarm his master. Justice and\r\nreligion are at the lowest ebb. Public offices are disposed of at\r\nprivate sale. The members of the council indulge in the greatest freedom\r\nin their discussions on matters of religion. It is plain that the\r\nConfession of Augsburg would be acceptable to some of them. The truth is\r\nnever allowed to reach the king's ears; as the letters sent to Madrid\r\nare written to suit the majority of the council, and so as not to give\r\nan unfavorable view of the country. Viglius is afraid to write. There\r\nare spies at the court, he says, who would betray his correspondence,\r\nand it might cost him his life. Granvelle concludes by urging the king\r\nto come in person, and with money enough to subsidize a force to support\r\nhim. Papiers d'Etat de Granvelle, tom.

See, in particular, a\r\nletter to Philip, dated as early as August 20, 1563, where he sums up\r\nhis remarks on the matter by saying: \"In fine, they would entirely\r\nchange the form of government, so that there would be little remaining\r\nfor the regent to do, as the representative of your majesty, or for your\r\nmajesty yourself to do, since they would have completely put you under\r\nguardianship.\" Papiers d'Etat de Granvelle, tom.

I. p. 328.\r\n\r\n[636] Yet whatever slight Philip may have put upon the lords in this\r\nrespect, he showed William, in particular, a singular proof of\r\nconfidence. The prince's _cuisine_, as I have elsewhere stated, was\r\nrenowned over the Continent; and Philip requested of him his _chef_, to\r\ntake the place of his own, lately deceased. But the king seems to lay\r\nless stress on the skill of this functionary than on his\r\ntrustworthiness,--a point of greater moment with a monarch. This was a\r\ncompliment--in that suspicious age--to William, which, we imagine, he\r\nwould have been slow to return by placing his life in the hands of a\r\ncook from the royal kitchens of Madrid. See Philip's letter in the\r\nCorrespondance de Guillaume le Taciturne, tom. II p. 89.\r\n\r\n[637] Margaret would fain have settled the dispute by giving the\r\ncountess of Egmont precedence at table over her fair rival. (Archives de\r\nla Maison d'Orange-Nassau, tom. I. p. 445.) But both Anne of Saxony and\r\nher household stoutly demurred to this decision,--perhaps to the right\r\nof the regent to make it. \"Les femmes ne se cédent en rien et se\r\ntiegnent par le bras, _ingredientes pari passu_, et si l'on rencontre\r\nune porte trop estroicte, l'on se serre l'ung sur l'aultre pour passer\r\négalement par ensamble, affin que il n'y ayt du devant ou derrière.\"\r\nArchives de la Maison d'Orange-Nassau, Supplément, p. 22.\r\n\r\n[638] There is a curious epistle, in Groen's collection, from William to\r\nhis wife's uncle, the elector of Saxony, containing sundry charges\r\nagainst his niece. The termagant lady was in the habit, it seems, of\r\nrating her husband roundly before company. William, with some _naïveté_,\r\ndeclares he could have borne her ill-humor to a reasonable extent in\r\nprivate, but in public it was intolerable. Unhappily, Anne gave more\r\nserious cause of disturbance to her lord than that which arose from her\r\ntemper, and which afterwards led to their separation. On the present\r\noccasion, it may be added, the letter was not sent,--as the lady, who\r\nhad learned the nature of it, promised amendment. Ibid., tom. II. p. 31.\r\n\r\n[639] \"Au cas que le Roi s'en excuse, il doit demander que S.

This display of schoolboy\r\nerudition, so unlike the masculine simplicity of the prince of Orange,\r\nmay be set down among those fine things, the credit of which may be\r\nfairly given to the historian rather than to the hero.--Burgundius,\r\nHist.

But Morillon was too much of a gossip to be the best authority;\r\nand, as this was understood to be one of the objects of the count's\r\nmission, it will be but justice to him to take the common opinion that\r\nhe executed it.\r\n\r\n[649] \"Negavit accitos à se illos fuisse, ut docerent an permittere id\r\nposset, sed an sibi necessariò permittendum præscriberent.\" Strada, De\r\nBello Belgico, tom.

I find,\r\nhowever, no warrant for such an opinion in the letters of either the\r\nduke or Don Juan Manrique de Lara, major-domo to Queen Isabella, the\r\noriginals of which are still preserved in the Royal Library at Paris. In\r\nmy copy of these MSS. the letters of Alva to Philip the Second cover\r\nmuch the larger space. They are very minute in their account of his\r\nconversation with the queen-mother. His great object seems to have been,\r\nto persuade her to abandon her temporizing policy, and, instead of\r\nendeavoring to hold the balance between the contending parties, to\r\nassert, in the most uncompromising manner, the supremacy of the Roman\r\nCatholics. He endeavored to fortify her in this course by the example of\r\nhis own master, the king of Spain, repeating Philip's declaration, so\r\noften quoted, under various forms, that \"he would surrender his kingdom,\r\nnay life itself, rather than reign over heretics.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the duke earnestly endeavored to overcome the arguments of\r\nCatherine de Medicis in favor of a milder, more rational, and, it may be\r\nadded, more politic course in reference to the Huguenots, he cannot\r\njustly be charged with having directly recommended those atrocious\r\nmeasures which have branded her name with infamy. Yet, on the other\r\nhand, it cannot be denied that this bloody catastrophe was a legitimate\r\nresult of the policy which he advised.\r\n\r\n[703] \"On voit journellement gens de ce pays aller en Angleterre, avec\r\nleurs familles et leurs instruments; et jà Londres, Zandvich et le pays\r\nallenviron est si plain, que l'on dit que le nombre surpasse 30,000\r\ntestes.\" Assonleville to Granvelle, January 15, 1565, Correspondance de\r\nPhilippe II., tom.

I. p. 236.\r\n\r\nAmong those who urged the king to violent measures, no one was so\r\nimportunate as Fray Lorenzo de Villacancio, an Augustin monk, who\r\ndistinguished himself by the zeal and intrepidity with which he ventured\r\ninto the strongholds of the Reformers, and openly denounced their\r\ndoctrines. Philip, acquainted with the uncompromising temper of the man,\r\nand his devotion to the Catholic Church, employed him both as an agent\r\nand an adviser in regard to the affairs of the Low Countries. where Fray\r\nLorenzo was staying in the earlier period of the troubles. Many of the\r\nfriar's letters to the king are still preserved in Simancas, and\r\nastonish one by the boldness of their criticisms on the conduct of the\r\nministers, and even of the monarch himself, whom Lorenzo openly accuses\r\nof a timid policy towards the Reformers.\r\n\r\nIn a memorial on the state of the country, prepared, at Philip's\r\nsuggestion, in the beginning of 1566, Fray Lorenzo urges the necessity\r\nof the most rigorous measures towards the Protestants in the\r\nNetherlands. \"Since your majesty holds the sword which God has given to\r\nyou, with the divine power over our lives, let it be drawn from the\r\nscabbard, and plunged in the blood of the heretics, if you do not wish\r\nthat the blood of Jesus Christ, shed by these barbarians, and the blood\r\nof the innocent Catholics whom they have oppressed, should cry aloud to\r\nHeaven for vengeance on the sacred head of your majesty!... The holy\r\nking David showed no pity for the enemies of God. He slew them, sparing\r\nneither man nor woman. Moses and his brother, in a single day, destroyed\r\nthree thousand of the children of Israel. An angel, in one night, put to\r\ndeath more than sixty thousand enemies of the Lord. Your majesty is a\r\nking, like David; like Moses, a captain of the people of Jehovah; an\r\nangel of the Lord,--for so the Scriptures style the kings and captains\r\nof his people;--and these heretics are the enemies of the living God!\"\r\nAnd in the same strain of fiery and fanatical eloquence he continues to\r\ninvoke the vengeance of Philip on the heads of his unfortunate subjects\r\nin the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThat the ravings of this hard-hearted bigot were not distasteful to\r\nPhilip may be inferred from the fact that he ordered a copy of his\r\nmemorial to be placed in the hands of Alva, on his departure for the Low\r\nCountries. It appears that he had some thoughts of sending Fray Lorenzo\r\nto join the duke there,--a project which received little encouragement\r\nfrom the latter, who probably did not care to have so meddlesome a\r\nperson as this frantic friar to watch his proceedings.\r\n\r\nAn interesting notice of this remarkable man is to be found in Gachard,\r\nCorrespondance de Philippe II., tom. II., Rapport, pp. xvi.-1.\r\n\r\n[803] \"Y por la priesa que dieron en esto, no ubo tiempo de consultarlo\r\ná Su Santidad, como fuera justo, y quiza avra sido así mejor, pues no\r\nvale nada, sino quitandola Su Santidad que es que la pone; pero en esto\r\nconviene que aya el secreto que puede considerar.\" Correspondance de\r\nPhilippe II., tom.

Their desire for reform only extended to certain crying\r\nabuses; but, in the words of his metaphor, the stream which they would\r\nhave turned to the irrigation of the ground soon swelled to a terrible\r\ninundation.--\"Contra l'opinion de'principali della lega, che volevano\r\nindur timore et non tanto danno....

But there was no\r\npretence that at this time Egmont's life was in danger. Morillon, in his\r\neagerness to cater for the cardinal's appetite for gossip, did not\r\nalways stick at the improbable.\r\n\r\n[850] \"Il leur en coûtera cher (s'écria-t-il en se tirant la barbe), il\r\nleur en coûtera cher; j'en jure par l'âme de mon père.\" Gachard,\r\nAnalectes Belgiques, p. 254.\r\n\r\n[851] \"De tout cela (disje) ne se perdit un seul moment en ce temps, non\r\nobstant la dicte maladie de Sa Majte, la quelle se monstra semblablement\r\nselon son bon naturel, en tous ces negoces et actions tousjours tant\r\nmodeste, et temperée et constante en iceulx affaires, quelques extremes\r\nqu'ilz fussent, que jamais l'on n'a veu en icelle signal, ou de passion\r\ncontre les personnes d'une part, ou de relasche en ses negoces de\r\nl'aultre.\" Hopper, Recueil et Mémorial, p. 104.\r\n\r\n[852] At this period stops the \"Recueil et Mémorial des Troubles des\r\nPays-Bas\" of Joachim Hopper, which covers a hundred quarto pages of the\r\nsecond volume (part second) of Hoynck van Papendrecht's \"Analecta\r\nBelgica.\" Hopper was a jurist, a man of learning and integrity. In 1566\r\nhe was called to Madrid, raised to the post of keeper of the seals for\r\nthe affairs of the Netherlands, and made a member of the council of\r\nstate. He never seems to have enjoyed the confidence of Philip in\r\nanything like the degree which Granvelle and some other ministers could\r\nboast; for Hopper was a Fleming. Yet his situation in the cabinet made\r\nhim acquainted with the tone of sentiment as well as the general policy\r\nof the court; while, as a native of Flanders, he could comprehend,\r\nbetter than a Spaniard, the bearing this policy would have on his\r\ncountrymen. His work, therefore, is of great importance as far as it\r\ngoes. It is difficult to say why it should have stopped _in mediis_, for\r\nHopper remained still in office, and died at Madrid ten years after the\r\nperiod to which he brings his narrative. He may have been discouraged by\r\nthe remarks of Viglius, who intimates, in a letter to his friend, that\r\nthe chronicler should wait to allow time to disclose the secret springs\r\nof action. See the Epistolæ ad Hopperum, p. 419.\r\n\r\n[853] Correspondance de Marguerite d'Autriche, p. 206.\r\n\r\n[854] \"Questo è il nuvolo che minaccia ora i nostri paesi; e n'uscirà la\r\ntempesta forse prima che non si pensa.

Hoorne in his \"Justification,\" refers the failure to Egmont.\r\nNeither one nor the other throws light on the course of discussion.\r\nBentivoglio, in his account of the interview, shows no such reserve; and\r\nhe gives two long and elaborate speeches from Orange and Egmont, in as\r\ngood set phrase as if they had been expressly reported by the parties\r\nthemselves for publication. The Italian historian affects a degree of\r\nfamiliarity with the proceedings of this secret conclave by no means\r\ncalculated to secure our confidence. Guerra di Fiandra, pp. 123-128.\r\n\r\n[859] \"Siesse qu'elle jure que s'et la plus grande vilagnerie du\r\nmonde..... et que s'et ung vray pasquil fameulx et qui doit ettre forgé\r\npardechà, et beaucoup de chozes semblables.\" Archives de la Maison\r\nd'Orange-Nassau, tom.

(Correspondance de Marguerite d'Autriche, p. 327.) One who\r\nfinds it impossible that the prince of Orange could lend himself to such\r\na piece of duplicity, may perhaps be staggered when he calls to mind his\r\ncurious correspondence with the elector and with King Philip in relation\r\nto Anne of Saxony, before his marriage with that princess. Yet Margaret,\r\nas Egmont hints, was of the Italian school; and Strada, her historian,\r\ndismisses the question with a doubt,--\"in medio ego quidem relinquo.\" A\r\ndoubt from Strada is a decision against Margaret.\r\n\r\n[861] Correspondance de Philippe II., tom I. p. 474.\r\n\r\n[862] Ibid., p. 491.\r\n\r\n[863] Strada, De Bello Belgico, tom.

Ibid., ubi supra.\r\n\r\n[900] According to Strada, some thought that William knew well what he\r\nwas about when he left his son behind him at Louvain; and that he would\r\nhave had no objection that the boy should be removed to\r\nMadrid,--considering that, if things went badly with himself, it would\r\nbe well for the heir of the house to have a hold on the monarch's favor.\r\nThis is rather a cool way of proceeding for a parent, it must be\r\nadmitted. Yet it is not very dissimilar from that pursued by William's\r\nown father, who, a stanch Lutheran himself, allowed his son to form part\r\nof the imperial household, and to be there nurtured in the Roman\r\nCatholic faith.

Yet the president was wise enough to\r\nsee that sufficient had been done at present in breaking up the\r\npreachings. \"Time and Philip's presence must do the rest.\" (Epistolæ ad\r\nHopperum, p. 433.) \"Those,\" he says in another letter, \"who have set the\r\nking against the edict have greatly deceived him.

God would take this as ill of your majesty, as you would\r\ntake it of those of your vassals whom you had raised to offices of trust\r\nand honor, and who took the offices, but left you to do the work for\r\nthem!

The two oldest authorities, Livy and Polybius, differ\r\non the point, and it has remained a vexed question ever since,--the\r\ncriticism of later years, indeed, leaning to still another route, that\r\nacross the Little St. Bernard. The passage of Hannibal forms the subject\r\nof a curious discussion introduced into Gibbon's journal, when the young\r\nhistorian was in training for the mighty task of riper years. His\r\nreluctance, even at the close of his argument, to strike the balance, is\r\nsingularly characteristic of his sceptical mind.\r\n\r\n[944] \"A suidar da quel nido di Demoni, le sceleraggini di tanti\r\nAppostati.\" Leti, Vita di Filippo II., tom.

It is but just to\r\nadd, that he says the government took prompt measures to repress it, by\r\nordering some of the principal offenders to the gibbet. Burgon, Life of\r\nGresham, vol. II. pp. 229, 230.\r\n\r\n[973] The duchess, in a letter to Philip, September 8, 1567, says that a\r\nhundred thousand people fled the country on the coming of Alva! (Strada,\r\nDe Bello Belgico, tom. I. p. 357.) If this be thought a round\r\nexaggeration, dictated by policy or by fear, still there are positive\r\nproofs that the emigration at this period was excessive. Thus, by a\r\nreturn made of the population of London and its suburbs, this very year\r\nof 1567, it appears that the number of Flemings was as large as that of\r\nall other foreigners put together. See Bulletins de l'Académie Royale de\r\nBruxelles, tom. XIV. p. 127.\r\n\r\n[974] Thus Jean de Hornes, Baron de Boxtel, writes to the prince of\r\nOrange: \"J'ay prins une résolution pour mon faict et est que je fay tout\r\neffort de scavoir si l'on poulrast estre seurement en sa maison: si\r\nainsy est, me retireray en une des miennes le plus abstractement que\r\npossible sera; sinon, regarderay de chercher quelque résidence en\r\ndesoubs ung aultre Prince.\" Archives de la Maison d'Orange-Nassau, tom.\r\nIII. p. 125.\r\n\r\n[975] Göthe, in his noble tragedy of \"Egmont,\" seems to have borrowed a\r\nhint from Shakespeare's \"blanket of the dark,\" to depict the gloom of\r\nBrussels,--where he speaks of the heavens as wrapt in a dark pall from\r\nthe fatal hour when the duke entered the city.

They make but one head under\r\nthe same hat.\" He mentions Vargas and Del Rio in particular. Granvelle's\r\nreply is very characteristic. Far from sympathizing with his querulous\r\nfollower, he predicts the ruin of his fortunes by this mode of\r\nproceeding. \"A man who would rise in courts must do as he is bidden,\r\nwithout question. Far from taking umbrage, he must bear in mind that\r\ninjuries, like pills, should he swallowed without chewing, that one may\r\nnot taste the bitterness of them;\"--a noble maxim, if the motive had\r\nbeen noble. See Levesque, Mémoires de Granvelle, tom. II. pp. 91-94.\r\n\r\n[1018] The historians of the time are all more or less diffuse on the\r\ndoings of the Council of Troubles, written as they are in characters of\r\nblood. But we look in vain for any account of the interior organization\r\nof that tribunal, or of its mode of judicial procedure. This may be\r\nowing to the natural reluctance which the actors themselves felt, in\r\nlater times, to being mixed up with the proceedings of a court so\r\nuniversally detested. For the same reason, as Gachard intimates, they\r\nmay not improbably have even destroyed some of the records of its\r\nproceedings. Fortunately that zealous and patriotic scholar has\r\ndiscovered in the Archives of Simancas sundry letters of Alva and his\r\nsuccessor, as well as some of the official records of the tribunal,\r\nwhich in a great degree supply the defect. The result he has embodied in\r\na luminous paper prepared for the Royal Academy of Belgium, which has\r\nsupplied me with the materials for the preceding pages.

At least, we find a letter from her to Philip\r\nwhen she had nearly reached the borders, dated at Luxembourg, on the\r\ntwelfth of that month.\r\n\r\n[1048] See, among others, Strada, De Bello Belgico, tom.

(Documentos Inéditos, tom. IV. p. 489.) Viglius, in a\r\nletter of the twenty-ninth of March, says fifteen hundred had been\r\nalready cited before the tribunal, the greater part of whom--they had\r\nprobably fled the country--were condemned for contumacy. (Epist. ad\r\nHopperum, p. 415.) Grotius, alluding to this period, speaks even more\r\nvaguely of the multitude of the victims, as _innumerable_. \"Stipatæ reis\r\ncustodiæ, innumeri mortales necati: ubique una species ut captæ\r\ncivitatis.\" (Annales, p. 29.) So also Hooft, cited by Brandt: \"The\r\ngallows, the wheels, stakes, and trees in the highways, were loaden with\r\ncarcasses or limbs of such as had been hanged, beheaded, or roasted; so\r\nthat the air, which God had made for respiration of the living, was now\r\nbecome the common grave or habitation of the dead.\" (Reformation in the\r\nLow Countries, vol. I. p. 261.) Language like this, however expressive,\r\ndoes little for statistics.\r\n\r\n[1069] Correspondance de Philippe II., tom. II. p. 4.\r\n\r\n[1070] Sentences passed by the Council of Blood against a great number\r\nof individuals--two thousand or more--have been collected in a little\r\nvolume, (Sententien en Indagingen van Alba,) published at Amsterdam, in\r\n1735. The parties condemned were for the most part natives of Holland,\r\nZealand, and Utrecht. They would seem, with very few exceptions, to have\r\nbeen absentees, and, being pronounced guilty of contumacy, were\r\nsentenced to banishment and the confiscation of their property. The\r\nvolume furnishes a more emphatic commentary on the proceedings of Alva\r\nthan anything which could come from the pen of the historian.\r\n\r\n[1071] \"Acabando este castigo comenzaré á prender algunos particulares\r\nde los mas culpados y mas ricos para moverlos á que vengan á\r\ncomposición.\" Documentos Inéditos, tom.

This\r\ninformation was given to Alva by Villers, one of the banished lords,\r\nafter he had fallen into the duke's hands in a disastrous affair, of\r\nwhich some account will be given in the present chapter.

But William was too practised\r\na writer, as Groen well suggests, to make it probable that he would\r\ntrust the composition of a paper of such moment to any hand but his own.\r\nIt is very likely that he submitted his own draft to the revision of\r\nLanguet, whose political sagacity he well understood. And this is the\r\nmost that can be fairly inferred from Languet's own account of the\r\nmatter: \"Fui Dillemburgi per duodecim et tredecim dies, ubi Princeps\r\nOrangiæ mihi et aliquot aliis curavit prolixe explicari causas et initia\r\ntumultuum in inferiore Germania et suam responsionem ad accusationes\r\nAlbani.\" It fared with the prince's \"Justification\" as it did with the\r\nfamous \"Farewell Address\" of Washington, so often attributed to another\r\npen than his, but which, however much it may have been benefited by the\r\ncounsels and corrections of others, bears on every page unequivocal\r\nmarks of its genuineness.\r\n\r\nThe \"Justification\" called out several answers from the opposite party.\r\nAmong them were two by Vargas and Del Rio. But in the judgment of\r\nViglius--whose bias certainly did not lie on William's side--these\r\nanswers were a failure. See his letter to Hopper (Epist. ad Hopperum, p.\r\n458).

See Reiffenberg, Correspondance de Marguerite d'Autriche,\r\np. 363.\r\n\r\n[1106] \"His tamen Albanus facilè contemptis, quippe à diuternâ rerum\r\nexperientiâ suspicax, et suopte ingenio ab aliorum consiliis, si ultrò\r\npræsertim offerrentur aversus.\" Strada, De Bello Belgico, tom.

One may imagine the interest with which William and his\r\nfriends listened to the recital of the tragedy; and how deep must have\r\nbeen their anxiety for the fate of their other friends,--Hoorne and\r\nEgmont in particular,--over whom the sword of the executioner hung by a\r\nthread. We may well credit the account of the consternation that reigned\r\nthroughout Brussels. \"Il affirme que c'estoit une chose de l'autre\r\nmonde, le crys, lamentation et juste compassion qu'aviont tous ceux de\r\nla ville du dit Bruxelles, nobles et ignobles, pour ceste barbare\r\ntyrannie, mais que nonobstant, ce cestuy Nero d'Alve se vante en ferat\r\nle semblable de tous ceulx quy potra avoir en mains.\" P. 241.\r\n\r\n[1108] If we are to believe Bentivoglio, Backerzele was torn asunder by\r\nhorses. \"Da quattro cavalli fu smembrato vivo in Brusselles il Casembrot\r\ngià segretario dell'Agamonte.\" (Guerra di Fiandra, p. 200.) But Alva's\r\ncharacter, hard and unscrupulous as he may have been in carrying out his\r\ndesigns, does not warrant the imputation of an act of such wanton\r\ncruelty as this. Happily it is not justified by historic testimony; no\r\nnotice of the fact being found in Strada, or Meteren, or the author of\r\nthe Guerres Civiles du Pays-Bas, not to add other writers of the time,\r\nwho cannot certainly be charged with undue partiality to the Spaniards.\r\nIf so atrocious a deed had been perpetrated, it would be passing strange\r\nthat it should not have found a place in the catalogue of crimes imputed\r\nto Alva by the prince of Orange. See, in particular, his letter to\r\nSchwendi, written in an agony of grief and indignation, soon after he\r\nhad learned the execution of his friends. Archives de la Maison\r\nd'Orange-Nassau, tom.

Both the\r\nquestions and answers, strange as it may seem, were originally drawn up\r\nin Castilian. A French version was immediately made by the secretary\r\nPratz,--probably for the benefit of the Flemish councillors of the\r\nbloody tribunal. Both the Castilian and French MSS. were preserved in\r\nthe archives of the house of Egmont until the middle of the last\r\ncentury, when an unworthy heir of this ancient line suffered them to\r\npass into other hands. They were afterwards purchased by the crown, and\r\nare now in a fitting place of deposit,--the Archives of the Kingdom of\r\nHolland.

I. pp. 44-63.\r\n\r\n[1122] Indeed, this seems to have been the opinion of the friends of the\r\ngovernment. Councillor Belin writes to Granvelle, December 14, 1567:\r\n\"They have arrested Hoorne and Egmont, but in their accusations have not\r\nconfined themselves to individual charges, but have accumulated a\r\nconfused mass of things.\" Raumer, Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries,\r\nvol. I. p. 182.\r\n\r\n[1123] For example, see the thirty-eighth article, in which the\r\nattorney-general accuses Egmont of admitting, on his examination, that\r\nhe had parted with one of his followers, suspected of heretical\r\nopinions, for a short time only, when, on the contrary, he had expressly\r\nstated that the dismissal was final, and that he had never seen the man\r\nsince. Supplément à Strada, tom. I. p. 40.\r\n\r\n[1124] Egmont's defence, of which extracts, wretchedly garbled, are\r\ngiven by Foppens, has been printed _in extenso_ by M. de Bavay, in his\r\nuseful compilation, Procès du Comte d'Egmont, (Bruxelles, 1854,) pp.\r\n121-153.\r\n\r\n[1125] \"Suppliant à tous ceux qui la verront, croire qu'il a respondu à\r\ntous les articles sincerement et en toute vérité, comme un Gentilhomme\r\nbien né est tenu et obligé de faire.\" Supplément à Strada, tom. I. p.\r\n209.\r\n\r\n[1126] Foppens has devoted nearly all the first volume of his\r\n\"_Supplément_\" to pieces illustrative of the proceedings against Egmont\r\nand Hoorne. The articles of accusation are given at length. His\r\ncountrymen are under obligations to this compiler, who thus early\r\nbrought before them so many documents of great importance to the\r\nnational history. The obligations would have been greater, if the editor\r\nhad done his work in a scholar-like way,--instead of heaping together a\r\nconfused mass of materials, without method, often without dates, and\r\nwith so little care, that the titles of the documents are not seldom at\r\nvariance with the contents.\r\n\r\n[1127] At least such is the account which Foppens gives of the\r\n\"Justification,\" as it is termed, of Hoorne, of which the Flemish editor\r\nhas printed only the preamble and the conclusion, without so much as\r\nfavoring us with the date of the instrument. (Supplément à Strada, tom.\r\nI. pp. 241-243.) M. de Bavay, on the other hand, has given the defence\r\nset up by Egmont's counsel _in extenso_. It covers seventy printed\r\npages, being double the quantity occupied by Egmont's defence of\r\nhimself. By comparing the two together, it is easy to see how closely\r\nthe former, though with greater amplification, is fashioned on the\r\nlatter.

No one except the prince of Orange had an income nearly so\r\ngreat as that of Egmont, amounting to 63,000 florins. He had a palace at\r\nBrussels, and other residences at Mechlin, Ghent, Bruges, Arras, and the\r\nHague.\r\n\r\nThe revenues of Count Hoorne amounted to about 8,500 florins. Count\r\nCulemborg, whose hotel was the place of rendezvous for the Gueux, had a\r\nyearly income exceeding 31,000 florins. William's revenues, far greater\r\nthan either, rose above 152,000.

Correspondance de\r\nPhilippe II., tom. II. p. 4.\r\n\r\n[1139] For the facts connected with the constitution of the _Toison\r\nd'Or_, I am indebted to a Dutch work, now in course of publication in\r\nAmsterdam (Algemeene Geschiedenis des Vaderlands, van de vroegste tijden\r\ntot op heden, door Dr. J. P. Arend). This work, which is designed to\r\ncover the whole history of the Netherlands, may claim the merits of a\r\nthoroughness rare in this age of rapid bookmaking, and of a candor rare\r\nin any age. In my own ignorance of the Dutch, I must acknowledge my\r\nobligations to a friend for enabling me to read it. I must further add,\r\nthat for the loan of the work I am indebted to the courtesy of B. Homer\r\nDixon, Esq., Consul for the Netherlands in Boston.\r\n\r\n[1140] M. de Bavay has devoted seventy pages or more of his publication\r\nto affidavits of witnesses in behalf of the prosecution. (Procès du\r\nComte d'Egmont, pp. 267-322.) But their testimony bears almost\r\nexclusively on the subject of Egmont's dealings with the\r\nsectaries,--scarcely warranting the Flemish editor's assertion in his\r\npreface, that he has been able to furnish \"all the elements of the\r\nconviction of the accused by the duke of Alva.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Bavay's work is one of the good fruits of that patriotic zeal\r\nwhich animates the Belgian scholars of our time for the illustration of\r\ntheir national history. It was given to the public only the last year,\r\nafter the present chapter had been written. In addition to what is\r\ncontained in former publications, it furnishes us with complete copies\r\nof the defence of Egmont, as prepared both by himself and his counsel,\r\nand with the affidavits above noticed of witnesses on the part of the\r\ngovernment. It has supplied me, therefore, with valuable materials,\r\nwhether for the correction or the corroboration of my previous\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\n[1141] The resistance, to which those who signed the Compromise were\r\npledged, was to the Inquisition, in case of its attempt to arrest any\r\nmember of their body.

Some reflections,\r\nboth on this law and the laws which subsequently modified it, made with\r\nthe usual acuteness of their author, may be found in the fifteenth\r\nchapter of Hallam's Constitutional History of England.\r\n\r\n[1143] The original document is to be found in the archives of Brussels,\r\nor was in the time of Vandervynckt, who, having examined it carefully,\r\ngives a brief notice of it. (Troubles des Pays-Bas, tom. II. pp. 256,\r\n257.) The name of its author should be cherished by the historian, as\r\nthat of a magistrate who, in the face of a tyrannical government, had\r\nthe courage to enter his protest against the judicial murders\r\nperpetrated under its sanction.\r\n\r\n[1144] Among other passages, see one in a letter of Margaret to the\r\nking, dated March 23, 1567. \"Ceulx de son conseil icy, qui s'employent\r\ntout fidèlement et diligemment en son service, et entre aultres le comte\r\nd'Egmont dont je ne puis avoir synon bon contentement.\" Correspondance\r\nde Marguerite d'Autriche, p. 235.\r\n\r\n[1145] M. de Gerlache, in a long note to the second edition of his\r\nhistory, enters into a scrutiny of Egmont's conduct as severe as that by\r\nthe attorney-general himself,--and with much the same result. (Hist. du\r\nRoyaume des Pays-Bas, tom. I. pp. 99-101.) \"Can any one believe,\" he\r\nasks, \"that if, instead of having the 'Demon of the South'for his\r\nmaster, it had been Charles the Fifth or Napoleon, Egmont would have\r\nbeen allowed to play the part he did with impunity so long?\" This kind\r\nof Socratic argument, as far as it goes, proves only that Philip did no\r\nworse than Charles or Napoleon would have done. It by no means proves\r\nEgmont to have deserved his sentence.\r\n\r\n[1146] Relacion de la Justicia que se hizo de los Contes Agamont y Orne,\r\nMS.\r\n\r\n[1147] \"Marcharent dans la ville en bataille, et avecques une batterie\r\nde tambourins et de phiffres si pitieuse qu'il n'y avoit spectateur de\r\nsi bon coeur qui ne palist et ne pleurast d'une si triste pompe funebre.\"\r\nMondoucet, ap.

Relacion de la Justicia, MS.\r\n\r\n[1200] This was the duplicate, no doubt, of the letter given to the\r\nbishop of Ypres, to whom Egmont may have intrusted a copy, with the idea\r\nthat it would be more certain to reach the hands of the king than the\r\none sent to his wife.\r\n\r\n[1201] \"La misère où elle se trouve, étant devenue veuve avec onze\r\nenfans, abandonnée de tous, hors de son pays et loin de ses parents, l'a\r\nempêchée d'envoyer plus tôt au Roi la dernière et très-humble requête de\r\nson défunt mari.\" Correspondance de Philippe II., tom.

Independently of other considerations, this\r\ndeparture from historic truth cannot be defended on any true principle\r\nof dramatic effect.\r\n\r\n[1206] Raumer, Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries, vol.

(Arend, Algemeene\r\nGeschiedenis des Vaderlands, D. II. St. v. bl. 66.) The gulden, or\r\nguilder, at the present day, is equivalent to about one shilling and\r\nninepence sterling, or thirty-nine cents.\r\n\r\n[1208] Philip, Count Egmont, lived to enjoy his ancestral honors till\r\n1590, when he was slain at Ivry, fighting against Henry the Fourth and\r\nthe Protestants of France. He died without issue, and was succeeded by\r\nhis brother Lamoral, a careless prodigal, who with the name seems to\r\nhave inherited few of the virtues of his illustrious father.

I. p. 394.\r\n\r\n[1215] The Flemish councillor, Hessels, who, it may be remembered, had\r\nparticular charge of the provincial prosecutions, incurred still greater\r\nodium by the report of his being employed to draft the sentences of the\r\ntwo lords. He subsequently withdrew from the bloody tribunal, and\r\nreturned to his native province, where he became vice-president of the\r\ncouncil of Flanders. This new accession of dignity only made him a more\r\nconspicuous mark for the public hatred. In 1577, in a popular\r\ninsurrection which overturned the government of Ghent, Hessels was\r\ndragged from his house, and thrown into prison. After lying there a\r\nyear, a party of ruffians broke into the place, forced him into a\r\ncarriage, and, taking him a short distance from town, executed the\r\nsummary justice of _Lynch law_ on their victim by hanging him to a tree.\r\nSome of the party, after the murder, were audacious enough to return to\r\nGhent, with locks of the gray hair of the wretched man displayed in\r\ntriumph on their bonnets.\r\n\r\nSome years later, when the former authorities were reëstablished, the\r\nbones of Hessels were removed from their unhallowed burial-place, and\r\nlaid with great solemnity and funeral pomp in the church of St. Michael.\r\nProse and verse were exhausted in his praise. His memory was revered as\r\nthat of a martyr. Miracles were performed at his tomb; and the popular\r\ncredulity went so far, that it was currently reported in Ghent that\r\nPhilip had solicited the pope for his canonization! See the curious\r\nparticulars in Vandervynckt, Troubles des Pays-Bas, tom. II. pp.\r\n451-456.\r\n\r\n[1216] \"Este es un pueblo tan fácil, que espero que con ver la clemencia\r\nde V.

It\r\nmay be well to mention, for the information of some of my readers, that\r\nit is performed by drawing a rope tight round the neck of the criminal,\r\nso as to produce suffocation. This is done by turning a stick to which\r\nthe rope is attached behind his head. Instead of this apparatus, an iron\r\ncollar is more frequently employed in modern executions.\r\n\r\n[1247] This is established by a letter of the cardinal himself, in which\r\nhe requests the king to command all officials to deliver into his hands\r\ntheir registers, instruments, and public documents of every\r\ndescription,--to be placed in these archives, that they may hereafter be\r\npreserved from injury. His biographer adds, that few of these\r\ndocuments--such only as could be gleaned by the cardinal's\r\nindustry--reach as far back as the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella.\r\nQuintinilla, Vida de Ximenes, p. 264.\r\n\r\n[1248] M.

The work of this eminent scholar,\r\nresting as it mainly does on the contemporary reports of the Venetian\r\nministers, is of the most authentic character; while he has the rare\r\ntalent of selecting facts so significant for historical illustration,\r\nthat they serve the double purpose of both facts and reflections.\r\n\r\n[1271] Cervantes, in his story of the Captive's adventures in Don\r\nQuixote, tells us that it was common with a renegado to obtain a\r\ncertificate from some of the Christian captives of his desire to return\r\nto Spain; so that if he were taken in arms against his countrymen, his\r\nconduct would be set down to compulsion, and he would thus escape the\r\nfangs of the Inquisition.\r\n\r\n[1272] See the History of the Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, vol.

His father fell, it seems, in an\r\nattempt to rescue his younger son from the hands of the enemy. Though\r\nthe father died, the son was saved. It was the same Don Martin de\r\nCordova who so stoutly defended Mazarquivir against Hassem afterwards,\r\nas mentioned in the text.

IV. cap. 13). But a\r\nletter from the imperial secretary, Gaztelu, informs us that care was\r\ntaken that the tidings should not reach the ear of his dying master. \"La\r\nmuerte del conde de Alcaudete y su desbarato se entendió aquí por carta\r\nde Don Alonso su hijo que despachó un correo desde Toledo con la nueva y\r\npor ser tan ruyn y estar S.

It is a large repository of facts\r\ncrudely put together, with little to boast of on the score of its\r\nliterary execution. It is interesting as the production of a Knight of\r\nSt. John, one of the unhappy few who survived to witness the treachery\r\nof his brethren and the extinction of his order. The last of the line,\r\nhe may well be pardoned, if, in his survey of the glorious past, he\r\nshould now and then sound the trumpet of glorification somewhat too\r\nloudly.\r\n\r\n[1296] \"The galleys of the order alone resisted the fury of the waves;\r\nand when Charles the Fifth was told that some vessels appeared still to\r\nlive at sea, he exclaimed, 'They must, indeed, be Maltese galleys which\r\ncan outride such a tempest!'

Yet even this was\r\nfar surpassed by the mammoth cannon employed by Mahomet at the siege of\r\nConstantinople, in the preceding century, which, according to Gibbon,\r\nthrew stone bullets of six hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nSince the above lines were written, even this achievement has been\r\ndistanced by British enterprise.

It stood without the\r\nwalls, and was connected with the ravelin by a bridge, the possession of\r\nwhich was hotly contested by the combatants. Balbi, the Spanish soldier,\r\nso often quoted,--one of the actors in the siege, though stationed at\r\nthe fort of St. Michael,--speaks of the fight as being carried on in the\r\nditch.

(Knights of Malta, vol. II. p. 219.)\r\nIf that were so, one would like to know how the historian got his\r\nknowledge of what was doing in the fortress the day and night previous\r\nto the assault. The details quoted above from Balbi account for this\r\nknowledge, and carry with them an air of probability. (Verdadera\r\nRelacion, fol. 55.)\r\n\r\n[1328] \"Luego que entraron los Turcos en sant Ermo, abatieron el\r\nest[=a]darte de san Juan, y en su lugar plantaron una vandera del gran\r\nTurco, y en todo aquel dia no hizieron otra cosa, que plantar v[=a]deras, y\r\nvanderillas por la muralla, segun su costumbre.\" Ibid., fol. 55.\r\n\r\nSee also, for the storming of St. Elmo, Calderon, Gloriosa Defensa de\r\nMalta, pp. 81-84; Miniana, Hist. de España, p. 351; Cabrera, Filipe\r\nSegundo, lib.

II. p. 219.\r\n\r\nNo name of the sixteenth century appears more frequently in the ballad\r\npoetry of Spain than that of Dragut. The \"_Romancero General_\" contains\r\nmany _romances_, some of them of great beauty, reciting the lament of\r\nthe poor captive chained to the galley of the dread rover, or\r\ncelebrating his naval encounters with the chivalry of Malta,--\"_las\r\nvelas de la religion,_\" as the squadrons of the order were called.\r\n\r\n[1333] Balbi, Verdadera Relacion, fol. 33.\r\n\r\n[1334] The two principal authorities on whom I have relied for the siege\r\nof Malta are Balbi and Vertot. The former was a soldier, who served\r\nthrough the siege, his account of which, now not easily met with, was\r\nprinted shortly afterwards, and in less than three years went into a\r\nsecond edition,--being that used in the present work. As Balbi was both\r\nan eye-witness and an actor, on a theatre so limited that nothing could\r\nbe well hidden from view, and as he wrote while events were fresh in his\r\nmemory, his testimony is of the highest value. It loses nothing by the\r\ntemperate, home-bred style in which the book is written, like that of a\r\nman anxious only to tell the truth, and not to magnify the cause or the\r\nparty to which he is attached. In this the honest soldier forms a\r\ncontrast to his more accomplished rival, the Abbé de Vertot.\r\n\r\nThis eminent writer was invited to compose the history of the order, and\r\nits archives were placed by the knights at his disposal for this\r\npurpose. He accepted the task; and in performing it he has sounded the\r\nnote of panegyric with as hearty a good will as if he had been a knight\r\nhospitaller himself. This somewhat detracts from the value of a work\r\nwhich must be admitted to rest, in respect to materials, on the soundest\r\nhistorical basis. The abbé's turn for the romantic has probably aided,\r\ninstead of hurting him, with the generality of readers. His clear and\r\nsometimes eloquent style, the interest of his story, and the dramatic\r\nskill with which he brings before the eye the peculiar traits of his\r\nactors, redeem, to some extent, the prolixity of his narrative, and have\r\ncombined, not merely to commend the book to popular favor, but to make\r\nit the standard work on the subject.\r\n\r\n[1335] By another ordinance, La Valette caused all the dogs in La Sangle\r\nand Il Borgo to be killed, because they disturbed the garrisons by\r\nnight, and ate their provisions by day.

His chronology may be corrected by that of Balbi,\r\nwhose narrative, taking the form of a diary, in which the transactions\r\nof each day are separately noted, bears the stamp of much greater\r\naccuracy.

Among others is a cannon of singular\r\nworkmanship, but very inferior in size to the two pieces of ordnance\r\nmentioned in the text. (See Bigelow's Travels in Malta and Sicily, p.\r\n226.)

The whole Moslem force, according to Balbi, was\r\nforty-eight thousand, exclusive of seamen. Of these about thirty\r\nthousand were Turks. The remainder belonged to the contingents furnished\r\nby Dragut and Hassem. Conf., fol. 25 and 121.\r\n\r\n[1387] Balbi, Verdadera Relacion, fol. 128.--Balbi gives a list of all\r\nthe knights who perished in the siege. Cabrera makes a similar estimate\r\nof the Christian loss. (Filipe Segundo, lib. VI. cap. 28.) De Thou rates\r\nit somewhat lower (Hist. Universelle, tom. V. p. 90); and Vertot lower\r\nstill. (Knights of Malta, vol. III. p. 38.) Yet Balbi may be thought to\r\nshow too little disposition, on other occasions, to exaggerate the loss\r\nof his own side for us to suspect him of exaggeration here.\r\n\r\n[1388] \"En todo este sitio no se a justiciado sino un solo Italiano\r\nSenes el qual mando justiciar Melchior de Robles: porque dixo\r\npublicamente estando en el mayor aprieto, que mas valiera que tomaramos\r\nlas quatro pagas que los turcos nos ofrecian, y el passage.\" Balbi,\r\nVerdadera Relacion, fol. 128.\r\n\r\n[1389] For this act of retributive justice, so agreeable to the feelings\r\nof the reader, I have no other authority to give than Vertot, Knights of\r\nMalta, vol. III. p. 18.\r\n\r\n[1390] Ibid., pp. 39, 40.--Calderon, Gloriosa Defensa de Malta, pp. 189,\r\n190.--De Thou, Hist. Universelle, tom.

(Knights of Malta, vol. III. p. 41.) We should be better\r\npleased if the abbé had given his authority for this strange story, the\r\nprobability of which is not at all strengthened by what we know of the\r\ngrand-master's character.\r\n\r\n[1393] It was common for the Maltese cities, after the Spanish and\r\nItalian fashion, to have characteristic epithets attached to their\r\nnames. La Valette gave the new capital the title of \"_Umillima_,\"--\"most\r\nhumble,\"--intimating that humility was a virtue of highest price with\r\nthe fraternity of St. John. See Boisgelin, Ancient and Modern Malta,\r\nvol. I. p. 29.\r\n\r\n[1394] \"Plus de huit mille ouvriers y furent employés; et afin d'avancer\r\nplus aisément les travaux, le Pape Pie V. commanda qu'on y travaillât\r\nsans discontinuer, même les jours de Fêtes.\" Helyot, Hist. des Ordres\r\nReligieux.\r\n\r\n[1395] The style of the architecture of the new capital seems to have\r\nbeen, to some extent, formed on that of Rhodes, though, according to\r\nLord Carlisle, of a more ornate and luxuriant character than its model.\r\n\"I traced much of the military architecture of Rhodes, which, grave and\r\nsevere there, has here both swelled into great amplitude and blossomed\r\ninto copious efflorescence; it is much the same relation as Henry VII.'s\r\nChapel bears to a bit of Durham Cathedral.\" Diary in Turkish and Greek\r\nWaters, p. 200.\r\n\r\nThe account of Malta is not the least attractive portion of this\r\ncharming work, to which Felton's notes have given additional value.\r\n\r\n[1396] Vertot, Knights of Malta, vol.

I. p. 35.\r\n\r\nThe good knight dwells with complacency on the particulars of a ceremony\r\nin which he had often borne a part himself. It recalled to his mind the\r\nglorious days of an order, which he fondly hoped might one day be\r\nrestored to its primitive lustre.\r\n\r\n[1401] Alfieri, Schiller, and, in our day, Lord John Russell, have, each\r\naccording to his own conceptions, exhibited the poetic aspect of the\r\nstory to the eyes of their countrymen. The Castilian dramatist,\r\nMontalvan, in his \"Príncipe Don Carlos,\" written before the middle of\r\nthe seventeenth century, shows more deference to historic accuracy, as\r\nwell as to the reputation of Isabella, by not mixing her up in any way\r\nwith the fortunes of the prince of Asturias.\r\n\r\n[1402] This correspondence is printed in a curious volume, of the\r\ngreatest rarity, entitled, Elogios de Don Honorato Juan, (Valencia,\r\n1659,) p. 60 et seq.\r\n\r\n[1403] \"Egli in collera reiterò con maraviglia et riso di S.

His portrait of Carlos is as\r\nlittle flattering in regard to his person as to his\r\ncharacter.--\"Carolus, præter colorem et capillum, ceterùm corpore\r\nmendosus; quippe humero clatior, et tibia alterâ longior erat; nee minus\r\ndehonestamentum ab indole feroci et contumaci.\" De Bello Belgico, tom.\r\nI. p. 609.\r\n\r\n[1416] \"Este dia despues de haber comido queriendo Su Alteza bajar por\r\nuna escalera escura y de ruines pasos echó el pie derecho en vacio, y\r\ndió una vuelta sobre todo el cuerpo, y así cayó de cuatro ó cinco\r\nescalones. Dió con la cabeza un gran golpe en una puerta cerrada, y\r\nquedó la cabeza abajo y los pies arriba.\" Relacion de la enfermedad del\r\nPríncipe por el Doctor Olivares, Documentos Inéditos, tom. XV. p. 554.\r\n\r\n[1417] According to Guibert, the French ambassador, Carlos was engaged\r\nin a love adventure when he met with his fall,--having descended this\r\ndark stairway in search of the young daughter of the porter of the\r\ngarden. See Raumer, Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries, vol. I. p. 119.\r\n\r\n[1418] Ferreras, Hist. de l'Espagne, tom. IX. p. 429.\r\n\r\n[1419] Dr. Olivares bears emphatic testimony to this virtue, little to\r\nhave been expected in his patient.--\"Lo que á su salud cumplia hizo de\r\nla misma suerte, siendo tan obediente á los remedios que á todos\r\nespantaba que por fuertes y recios que fuesen nunca los reusó, antes\r\ntodo el tiempo que estuvo en su acuerdo él mismo los pedia, lo cual fué\r\ngrande ayuda para la salud que Dios le dió.\" Documentos Inéditos, tom.\r\nXV. p. 571.\r\n\r\n[1420] Another rival appeared, to contest the credit of the cure with\r\nthe bones of Fray Diego. This was Our Lady of Atocha, the patroness of\r\nMadrid, whose image, held in the greatest veneration by Philip the\r\nSecond, was brought to the chamber of Carlos, soon after the skeleton of\r\nthe holy friar. As it was after the patient had decidedly begun to mend,\r\nthere seems to be the less reason for the chroniclers of Our Lady of\r\nAtocha maintaining, as they sturdily do, her share in the cure. (Perada,\r\nLa Madona de Madrid, (Valladolid, 1604,) p. 151.) The veneration for the\r\npatroness of Madrid has continued to the present day. A late journal of\r\nthat capital states that the queen, accompanied by her august consort\r\nand the princess of Asturias, went, on the twenty-fourth of March, 1854,\r\nin solemn procession to the church, to decorate the image with the\r\ncollar of the Golden Fleece.\r\n\r\n[1421] \"Con todo eso tomando propriamente el nombre de milagro, á mi\r\njuicio no lo fué, porque el Príncipe se curó con los remedios naturales\r\ny ordinarios, con los cuales se suelen curar otros de la misma\r\nenfermedad estando tanto y mas peligrosos.\" Documentos Inéditos, tom.\r\nXV. p. 570.\r\n\r\n[1422] Raumer, Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries, vol.

A passage in a letter to Carlos\r\nfrom his almoner, Doctor Hernan Suarez de Toledo, has been interpreted\r\nas alluding to his intercourse with the deputies from Flanders: \"Tambien\r\nhe llorado, no haber parecido bien que V. A. _hablase a los\r\nprocuradores_, como dicen que lo hizo, no se lo que fue, pero si que\r\ncumple mucho hacer los hombres sus negocios propios, con consejo ageno,\r\npor que los muy diestros nunca fian del suyo.\" The letter, which is\r\nwithout date, is to be found in the archiepiscopal library of Toledo.\r\n\r\n[1438] De Bello Belgico, tom.

In one respect, however, they seem to have been relaxed, if, as\r\nNobili states, the prince was allowed to recreate himself with the\r\nperusal of Spanish law-books, which he may have consulted with reference\r\nto his own case. \"Hà domandato, che li siano letti li statuti, et le\r\nleggi di Spagna: ne'quali spende molto studio.

His indorsement, in his own handwriting, on the\r\ncover, shows the style in which he liked to be approached by his loving\r\nsubjects. \"This letter is written with prudence and discretion.\"--A\r\ntranslation of the letter, dated February 16, 1568, is in Llorente,\r\nHistoire de l'Inquisition, tom.

I. p. 147.\r\n\r\nVon Raumer has devoted some fifty pages of his fragmentary compilation\r\nto the story of Don Carlos, and more especially to the closing scenes of\r\nhis life. The sources are of the most unexceptionable kind, being\r\nchiefly the correspondence of the French ministers with their court,\r\nexisting among the MSS. in the Royal Library at Paris. The selections\r\nmade are pertinent in their character, and will be found of the greatest\r\nimportance to illustrate this dark passage in the history of the time.\r\nIf I have not arrived at the same conclusions in all respects as those\r\nof the illustrious German scholar, it may be that my judgment has been\r\nmodified by the wider range of materials at my command.\r\n\r\n[1511] Llorente, Histoire de l'Inquisition, tom. III. p. 171 et seq.\r\n\r\n[1512] \"Quoique ces documens ne soient pas authentiques, ils méritent\r\nqu'on y ajoute foi, en ce qu'ils sont de certaines personnes employées\r\ndans le palais du roi.\" Ibid., p. 171.\r\n\r\n[1513] Thus, for example, he makes the contradictory statements, at the\r\ndistance of four pages from each other, that the prince did, and that he\r\ndid not, confide to Don John his desire to kill his father (pp. 148,\r\n152). The fact is, that Llorente in a manner pledged himself to solve\r\nthe mystery of the prince's death, by announcing to his readers, at the\r\noutset, that \"he believed he had discovered the truth.\" One fact he must\r\nbe allowed to have established,--one which, as secretary to the\r\nInquisition, he had the means of verifying,--namely, that no process was\r\never instituted against Carlos by the Holy Office. This was to overturn\r\na vulgar error, on which more than one writer of fiction has built his\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n[1514] \"Le cicalerie, et novellacce, che si dicono, sono molto indigne\r\nd'essere ascoltate, non che scritte, perchè in vero il satisfar al\r\npopolaccio in queste simil cose è molto difficile; et meglio è farle,\r\nsiccome porta il giusto et l'honesto senza curarsi del giudicio\r\nd'huomini insani, et che parlono senza ragione di cose impertinenti et\r\nimpossibili di autori incerti, dappochi, et maligni.\" Lettera di Nobili,\r\nLuglio 30 1568, MS.\r\n\r\n[1515] Letter of Antonio Perez to the counsellor Du Vair, ap.

VII. cap. 22.\r\n\r\nThe admirable obscurity of the passage, in which the historian has\r\nperfectly succeeded in mystifying his critics, has naturally led them to\r\nsuppose that more was meant by him than meets the eye.\r\n\r\n[1518] \"Ex morbo ob alimenta partim obstinate recusata, partira\r\nintemperanter adgesta, nimiamque nivium refrigerationem, super animi\r\naigritudinem (_si modò vis abfuit_), in Divi Jacobi pervigilio extinctus\r\nest.\" Strada, De Bello Belgico, tom.

I. p. 320.\r\n\r\nA taste for jesting on this subject seems to have been still in fashion\r\nat the French court as late as Louis the Fourteenth's time. At least, we\r\nfind that monarch telling some one that \"he had sent Bussy Rabutin to\r\nthe Bastile for his own benefit, as Philip the Second said when he\r\nordered his son to be strangled.\" Lettres de Madame de Sevigné, (Paris,\r\n1822.) tom. VIII. p. 368.\r\n\r\n[1521] A French contemporary chronicler dismisses his account of the\r\ndeath of Carlos with the remark, that, of all the passages in the\r\nhistory of this reign, the fate of the young prince is the one involved\r\nin the most impenetrable mystery. Matthieu, Breve Compendio de la Vida\r\nPrivada de Felipe Segundo, (Span, trans.,) MS.\r\n\r\n[1522] The Abbé San Real finds himself unable to decide whether Carlos\r\ntook poison, or, like Seneca, had his veins opened in a warm bath, or,\r\nfinally, whether he was strangled with a silk cord by four slaves sent\r\nby his father to do the deed, in Oriental fashion. (Verdadera Historia\r\nde la Vida y Muerte del Príncipe Don. Carlos, Span, trans., MS.) The\r\ndoubts of San Real are echoed with formal solemnity by Leti, Vita di\r\nFlippo II., tom. I. p. 559.\r\n\r\n[1523] Von Raumer, who has given an analysis of this letter of Antonio\r\nPerez, treats it lightly, as coming from \"a double-dealing, bitter enemy\r\nof Philip,\" whose word on such a subject was of little value. (Sixteenth\r\nand Seventeenth Centuries, vol. I. p. 155.) It was certainly a singular\r\nproof of confidence in one who was so habitually close in his concerns\r\nas the prince of Eboli, that he should have made such a communication to\r\nPerez. Yet it must be admitted that the narrative derives some\r\nconfirmation from the fact, that the preceding portions of the letter\r\ncontaining it, in which the writer describes the arrest of Carlos,\r\nconform with the authentic account of that event as given in the text.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice, that both De Thou and Llorente concur with Perez\r\nin alleging poison as the cause of the prince's death. Though even here\r\nthere is an important discrepancy; Perez asserting it was a slow poison,\r\ntaking four months to work its effect, while the other authorities say\r\nthat its operation was immediate. Their general agreement, moreover, in\r\nregard to the employment of poison, is of the less weight, as such an\r\nagency would be the one naturally surmised under circumstances where it\r\nwould be desirable to leave no trace of violence on the body of the\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\n[1524] If we may take Brantôme's word, there was some ground for such\r\napprehension at all times. \"En fin il estoit un terrible masle; et s'il\r\neust vescu, assurez-vous qu'il s'en fust faict aeroire, et qu'il eust\r\nmis le pere en curatelle.\" OEuvres, tom. I. p. 323.\r\n\r\n[1525] \"Li più favoriti del Rè erono odiati da lui a morte, et adesso\r\ntanto più, et quando questo venisse a regnare si teneriano rovinati\r\nloro.\" Lettera del Nunzio, Febraio 14, 1568, MS.\r\n\r\n[1526] Ante. p. 177.\r\n\r\nIt is in this view that Dr. Salazar de Mendoza does not shrink from\r\nasserting, that, if Philip did make a sacrifice of his son, it rivalled\r\nin sublimity that of Isaac by Abraham, and even that of Jesus Christ by\r\nthe Almighty! \"Han dicho de él lo que del Padre Eterno, que no perdonó á\r\nsu propio Hijo. Lo que del Patriarca Abraham en el sacrificio de Isaac\r\nsu unigénito. A todo caso humano excede la gloria que de esto le\r\nresulta, y no hay con quien comparalla.\" (Dignidades de Castilla y Leon,\r\np. 417.) He closes this rare piece of courtly blasphemy by assuring us\r\nthat in point of fact Carlos died a natural death. The doctor wrote in\r\nthe early part of Philip the Third's reign, when the manner of the\r\nprince's death was delicate ground for the historian.\r\n\r\n[1527] Philip the Second is not the only Spanish monarch who has been\r\ncharged with the murder of his son. Leovogild, a Visigothic king of the\r\nsixth century, having taken prisoner his rebel son, threw him into a\r\ndungeon, where he was secretly put to death. The king was an Arian,\r\nwhile the young prince was a Catholic, and might have saved his life if\r\nhe had been content to abjure his religion. By the Church of Rome,\r\ntherefore, he was regarded as a martyr; and it is a curious circumstance\r\nthat it was Philip the Second who procured the canonization of the\r\nslaughtered Hermenegild from Pope Sixtus the Fifth.\r\n\r\nFor the story, taken from that voluminous compilation of Florez, \"_La\r\nEspaña Sagrada_,\" I am indebted to Milman's History of Latin\r\nChristianity (London, 1854, vol. I. p. 446), one of the remarkable works\r\nof the present age, in which the author reviews, with curious erudition,\r\nand in a profoundly philosophical spirit, the various changes that have\r\ntaken place in the Roman hierarchy: and while he fully exposes the\r\nmanifold errors and corruptions of the system, he shows throughout that\r\nenlightened charity which is the most precious of Christian graces, as\r\nunhappily it is the rarest.\r\n\r\n[1528] Lettera di Nobili, Luglio 30, 1568, MS.\r\n\r\n[1529] I have before me another will made by Don Carlos in 1564, in\r\nAlcalá de Henares, the original of which is still extant in the Archives\r\nof Simancas.

I. p. 149.\r\n\r\n[1539] Besides Brantôme, and De Thou, elsewhere noticed in this\r\nconnection, another writer of that age, Pierre Matthieu, the royal\r\nhistoriographer of France, may be thought to insinuate something of the\r\nkind, when he tells us that \"the circumstance of Isabella so soon\r\nfollowing Carlos to the tomb had suggested very different grounds from\r\nthose he had already given as the cause of his death.\" (Breve Compendio\r\nde la Vida Privada del Rey Felipe Segundo, MS.) But the French writer's\r\naccount of Philip is nearly as apocryphal as the historical romance of\r\nSan Real, who, in all that relates to Carlos in particular, will be\r\nfound largely indebted to the lively imagination of his predecessor.\r\n\r\n[1540] \"Aussi dit on que cela fut cause de sa mort en partie, avec\r\nd'autres subjects que je ne dirai point à ceste heure; car il ne se\r\npouvoit garder de l'aimer dans son ame, l'honorer et reverer, tant il la\r\ntrouvoit aymable et agréable à ses yeux, comme certes elle l'estoit en\r\ntout.\" Brantôme, OEuvres, tom.

I. p. 379.\r\n\r\n[1543] At the head of these writers must undoubtedly be placed the Abbé\r\nSan Real, with whose romantic history of Don Carlos I am only acquainted\r\nin the Castilian translation, entitled \"Verdadera Historia de la Vida y\r\nMuerte del Principe Don Carlos.\" Yet, romance as it is, more than one\r\ngrave historian has not disdained to transplant its flowers of fiction\r\ninto his own barren pages. It is edifying to see the manner in which\r\nLeti, who stands not a little indebted to San Real, after stating the\r\nscandalous rumors in regard to Carlos and Isabella, concludes by\r\ndeclaring: \"Ma come io sorivo historia, e non romanzo, non posso afirmar\r\nnulli di certo, perche nulla di certo hò possuto raccore.\" Leti, Vita di\r\nFilippo II., tom.

Ibid., 163.\r\n\r\n[1575] The openness with which Carlos avowed his sentiments for Isabella\r\nmay be thought some proof of their innocence. Catherine de Medicis, in a\r\nletter to Fourquevaulx, dated February 28, 1568, says, alluding to the\r\nprince's arrest: \"I am concerned that the event very much distresses my\r\ndaughter, as well with regard to her husband as in respect of the\r\nprince, who has always let her know the good-will he bears to her.\"\r\nIbid., p. 141.\r\n\r\n[1576] The French historian, De Thou, by no means disposed to pass too\r\nfavorable a judgment on the actions of Philip, and who in the present\r\ncase would certainly not be likely to show him any particular grace,\r\nrejects without hesitation the suspicion of foul play on the part of the\r\nking. \"Quelques-uns soupçonnerent Philippe de l'avoir fait empoissoner,\r\nparce qu'il lui avoit fait un crime de la trop grande familiarité\r\nqu'elle avoit avec Dom Carlos. Il est néanmoins facile de se convaincre\r\ndu contraire, par la grande et sincère douleur que sa mort causa, tant à\r\nla Cour que dans toute l'Espagne; le Roi la pleura, comme une femme\r\nqu'il aimoit tres-tendrement.\" Histoire Universelle, tom. V. p. 437.\r\n\r\n[1577] Brantôme, OEuvres, tom. V. p. 137.\r\n\r\nYet Isabella's mother, Catherine de Medicis, found fault with her\r\ndaughter, in the interview at Bayonne, for having become altogether a\r\nSpaniard, saying to her tauntingly, \"_Muy Española venis_.\" To which the\r\nqueen meekly replied, \"It is possible that it may be so; but you will\r\nstill find me the same daughter to you as when you sent me to Spain.\"\r\nThe anecdote is told by Alva in a letter to the king.
