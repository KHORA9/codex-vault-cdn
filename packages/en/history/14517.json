Great numbers of autograph letters, diaries, and other\r\nwritings of persons engaged in the war have also been examined on this\r\nside of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nI owe to the kindness of the present Marquis de Montcalm the permission\r\nto copy all the letters written by his ancestor, General Montcalm, when\r\nin America, to members of his family in France. General Montcalm, from\r\nhis first arrival in Canada to a few days before his death, also carried\r\non an active correspondence with one of his chief officers, Bourlamaque,\r\nwith whom he was on terms of intimacy. These autograph letters are now\r\npreserved in a private collection. I have examined them, and obtained\r\ncopies of the whole. They form an interesting complement to the official\r\ncorrespondence of the writer, and throw the most curious side-lights on\r\nthe persons and events of the time.\r\n\r\nBesides manuscripts, the printed matter in the form of books, pamphlets,\r\ncontemporary newspapers, and other publications relating to the American\r\npart of the Seven Years' War, is varied and abundant; and I believe I\r\nmay safely say that nothing in it of much consequence has escaped me.\r\nThe liberality of some of the older States of the Union, especially New\r\nYork and Pennsylvania, in printing the voluminous records of their\r\ncolonial history, has saved me a deal of tedious labor.\r\n\r\nThe whole of this published and unpublished mass of evidence has been\r\nread and collated with extreme care, and more than common pains have\r\nbeen taken to secure accuracy of statement. The study of books and\r\npapers, however, could not alone answer the purpose. The plan of the\r\nwork was formed in early youth; and though various causes have long\r\ndelayed its execution, it has always been kept in view. Meanwhile, I\r\nhave visited and examined every spot where events of any importance in\r\nconnection with the contest took place, and have observed with attention\r\nsuch scenes and persons as might help to illustrate those I meant to\r\ndescribe. In short, the subject has been studied as much from life and\r\nin the open air as at the library table.\r\n\r\nThese two volumes are a departure from chronological sequence. The\r\nperiod between 1700 and 1748 has been passed over for a time. When this\r\ngap is filled, the series of \"France and England in North America\" will\r\nform a continuous history of the French occupation of the continent.\r\n\r\nBOSTON, Sept. 16, 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\nAuthor's Introduction\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER I\r\n   1745-1755\r\n   The Combatants\r\n\r\n\r\nEngland in the Eighteenth Century.

The Seven Years War in Europe is seen but dimly through\r\nrevolutionary convulsions and Napoleonic tempests; and the same contest\r\nin America is half lost to sight behind the storm-cloud of the War of\r\nIndependence. Few at this day see the momentous issues involved in it,\r\nor the greatness of the danger that it averted. The strife that armed\r\nall the civilized world began here. \"Such was the complication of\r\npolitical interests,\" says Voltaire, \"that a cannon-shot fired in\r\nAmerica could give the signal that set Europe in a blaze.\" Not quite. It\r\nwas not a cannon-shot, but a volley from the hunting-pieces of a few\r\nbackwoodsmen, commanded by a Virginian youth, George Washington.\r\n\r\nTo us of this day, the result of the American part of the war seems a\r\nforegone conclusion. It was far from being so; and very far from being\r\nso regarded by our forefathers. The numerical superiority of the British\r\ncolonies was offset by organic weaknesses fatal to vigorous and united\r\naction. Nor at the outset did they, or the mother-country, aim at\r\nconquering Canada, but only at pushing back her boundaries.\r\nCanada--using the name in its restricted sense--was a position of great\r\nstrength; and even when her dependencies were overcome, she could hold\r\nher own against forces far superior. Armies could reach her only by\r\nthree routes,--the Lower St. Lawrence on the east, the Upper St.\r\nLawrence on the west, and Lake Champlain on the south. The first access\r\nwas guarded by a fortress almost impregnable by nature, and the second\r\nby a long chain of dangerous rapids; while the third offered a series of\r\npoints easy to defend. During this same war, Frederic of Prussia held\r\nhis ground triumphantly against greater odds, though his kingdom was\r\nopen on all sides to attack.\r\n\r\nIt was the fatuity of Louis XV. and his Pompadour that made the conquest\r\nof Canada possible. Had they not broken the traditionary policy of\r\nFrance, allied themselves to Austria, her ancient enemy, and plunged\r\nneedlessly into the European war, the whole force of the kingdom would\r\nhave been turned, from the first, to the humbling of England and the\r\ndefence of the French colonies. The French soldiers left dead on\r\ninglorious Continental battle-fields could have saved Canada, and\r\nperhaps made good her claim to the vast territories of the West.\r\n\r\nBut there were other contingencies. The possession of Canada was a\r\nquestion of diplomacy as well as of war. If England conquered her, she\r\nmight restore her, as she had lately restored Cape Breton. She had an\r\ninterest in keeping France alive on the American continent. More than\r\none clear eye saw, at the middle of the last century, that the\r\nsubjection of Canada would lead to a revolt of the British colonies. So\r\nlong as an active and enterprising enemy threatened their borders, they\r\ncould not break with the mother-country, because they needed her help.\r\nAnd if the arms of France had prospered in the other hemisphere; if she\r\nhad gained in Europe or Asia territories with which to buy back what she\r\nhad lost in America, then, in all likelihood, Canada would have passed\r\nagain into her hands.\r\n\r\nThe most momentous and far-reaching question ever brought to issue on\r\nthis continent was: Shall France remain here, or shall she not? If, by\r\ndiplomacy or war, she had preserved but the half, or less than the half,\r\nof her American possessions, then a barrier would have been set to the\r\nspread of the English-speaking races; there would have been no\r\nRevolutionary War; and for a long time, at least, no independence. It\r\nwas not a question of scanty populations strung along the banks of the\r\nSt. Lawrence; it was--or under a government of any worth it would have\r\nbeen--a question of the armies and generals of France. America owes much\r\nto the imbecility of Louis XV. and the ambitious vanity and personal\r\ndislikes of his mistress.\r\n\r\nThe Seven Years War made England what she is. It crippled the commerce\r\nof her rival, ruined France in two continents, and blighted her as a\r\ncolonial power. It gave England the control of the seas and the mastery\r\nof North America and India, made her the first of commercial nations,\r\nand prepared that vast colonial system that has planted new Englands in\r\nevery quarter of the globe. And while it made England what she is, it\r\nsupplied to the United States the indispensable condition of their\r\ngreatness, if not of their national existence.\r\n\r\nBefore entering on the story of the great contest, we will look at the\r\nparties to it on both sides of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nMontcalm and Wolfe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 1\r\n\r\n1745-1755\r\n\r\nThe Combatants\r\n\r\n\r\nThe latter half of the reign of George II. was one of the most prosaic\r\nperiods in English history. The civil wars and the Restoration had had\r\ntheir enthusiasms, religion and liberty on one side, and loyalty on the\r\nother; but the old fires declined when William III. came to the throne,\r\nand died to ashes under the House of Hanover. Loyalty lost half its\r\ninspiration when it lost the tenet of the divine right of kings; and\r\nnobody could now hold that tenet with any consistency except the\r\ndefeated and despairing Jacobites. Nor had anybody as yet proclaimed the\r\nrival dogma of the divine right of the people. The reigning monarch held\r\nhis crown neither of God nor of the nation, but of a parliament\r\ncontrolled by a ruling class. The Whig aristocracy had done a priceless\r\nservice to English liberty. It was full of political capacity, and by no\r\nmeans void of patriotism; but it was only a part of the national life.\r\nNor was it at present moved by political emotions in any high sense. It\r\nhad done its great work when it expelled the Stuarts and placed William\r\nof Orange on the throne; its ascendency was now complete. The Stuarts\r\nhad received their death-blow at Culloden; and nothing was left to the\r\ndominant party but to dispute on subordinate questions, and contend for\r\noffice among themselves. The Troy squires sulked in their\r\ncountry-houses, hunted foxes, and grumbled against the reigning dynasty;\r\nyet hardly wished to see the nation convulsed by a counter-revolution\r\nand another return of the Stuarts.\r\n\r\nIf politics had run to commonplace, so had morals; and so too had\r\nreligion. Despondent writers of the day even complained that British\r\ncourage had died out. There was little sign to the common eye that under\r\na dull and languid surface, forces were at work preparing a new life,\r\nmaterial, moral, and intellectual. As yet, Whitefield and Wesley had not\r\nwakened the drowsy conscience of the nation, nor the voice of William\r\nPitt roused it like a trumpet-peal.\r\n\r\nIt was the unwashed and unsavory England of Hogarth, Fielding, Smollett,\r\nand Sterne; of Tom Jones, Squire Western, Lady Bellaston, and Parson\r\nAdams; of the \"Rake's Progress\" and \"Marriage à la Mode;\" of the lords\r\nand ladies who yet live in the undying gossip of Horace Walpole,\r\nbe-powdered, be-patched, and be-rouged, flirting at masked balls,\r\nplaying cards till daylight, retailing scandal, and exchanging double\r\nmeanings. Beau Nash reigned king over the gaming-tables of Bath; the\r\nostrich-plumes of great ladies mingled with the peacock-feathers of\r\ncourtesans in the rotunda at Ranelagh Gardens; and young lords in velvet\r\nsuits and embroidered ruffles played away their patrimony at White's\r\nChocolate-House or Arthur's Club. Vice was bolder than to-day, and\r\nmanners more courtly, perhaps, but far more coarse.\r\n\r\nThe humbler clergy were thought--sometimes with reason--to be no fit\r\ncompany for gentlemen, and country parsons drank their ale in the\r\nsquire's kitchen. The passenger-wagon spent the better part of a\r\nfortnight in creeping from London to York. Travellers carried pistols\r\nagainst footpads and mounted highwaymen. Dick Turpin and Jack Sheppard\r\nwere popular heroes. Tyburn counted its victims by scores; and as yet no\r\nHoward had appeared to reform the inhuman abominations of the prisons.\r\n\r\nThe middle class, though fast rising in importance, was feebly and\r\nimperfectly represented in parliament. The boroughs were controlled by\r\nthe nobility and gentry, or by corporations open to influence or\r\nbribery. Parliamentary corruption had been reduced to a system; and\r\noffices, sinecures, pensions, and gifts of money were freely used to\r\nkeep ministers in power. The great offices of state were held by men\r\nsometimes of high ability, but of whom not a few divided their lives\r\namong politics, cards, wine, horse-racing, and women, till time and the\r\ngout sent them to the waters of Bath. The dull, pompous, and irascible\r\nold King had two ruling passions,--money, and his Continental dominions\r\nof Hanover. His elder son, the Prince of Wales, was a centre of\r\nopposition to him. His younger son, the Duke of Cumberland, a character\r\nfar more pronounced and vigorous, had won the day at Culloden, and lost\r\nit at Fontenoy; but whether victor or vanquished, had shown the same\r\nvehement bull-headed courage, of late a little subdued by fast growing\r\ncorpulency. The Duke of Newcastle, the head of the government, had\r\ngained power and kept it by his rank and connections, his wealth, his\r\ncounty influence, his control of boroughs, and the extraordinary\r\nassiduity and devotion with which he practised the arts of corruption.\r\nHenry Fox, grasping, unscrupulous, with powerful talents, a warm friend\r\nafter his fashion, and a most indulgent father; Carteret, with his\r\nstrong, versatile intellect and jovial intrepidity; the two Townshends,\r\nMansfield, Halifax, and Chesterfield,--were conspicuous figures in the\r\npolitics of the time. One man towered above them all. Pitt had many\r\nenemies and many critics. They called him ambitious, audacious,\r\narrogant, theatrical, pompous, domineering; but what he has left for\r\nposterity is a loftiness of soul, undaunted courage, fiery and\r\npassionate eloquence, proud incorruptibility, domestic virtues rare in\r\nhis day, unbounded faith in the cause for which he stood, and abilities\r\nwhich without wealth or strong connections were destined to place him on\r\nthe height of power. The middle class, as yet almost voiceless, looked\r\nto him as its champion; but he was not the champion of a class. His\r\npatriotism was as comprehensive as it was haughty and unbending. He\r\nlived for England, loved her with intense devotion, knew her, believed\r\nin her, and made her greatness his own; or rather, he was himself\r\nEngland incarnate.\r\n\r\nThe nation was not then in fighting equipment. After the peace of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, the army within the three kingdoms had been reduced to\r\nabout eighteen thousand men. Added to these were the garrisons of\r\nMinorca and Gibraltar, and six or seven independent companies in the\r\nAmerican colonies. Of sailors, less than seventeen thousand were left in\r\nthe Royal Navy. Such was the condition of England on the eve of one of\r\nthe most formidable wars in which she was ever engaged.\r\n\r\nHer rival across the Channel was drifting slowly and unconsciously\r\ntowards the cataclysm of the Revolution; yet the old monarchy, full of\r\nthe germs of decay, was still imposing and formidable. The House of\r\nBourbon held the three thrones of France, Spain, and Naples; and their\r\nthreatened union in a family compact was the terror of European\r\ndiplomacy. At home France was the foremost of the Continental nations;\r\nand she boasted herself second only to Spain as a colonial power. She\r\ndisputed with England the mastery of India, owned the islands of Bourbon\r\nand Mauritius, held important possessions in the West Indies, and\r\nclaimed all North America except Mexico and a strip of sea-coast. Her\r\nnavy was powerful, her army numerous, and well appointed; but she lacked\r\nthe great commanders of the last reign. Soubise, Maillebois, Contades,\r\nBroglie, and Clermont were but weak successors of Condé, Turenne,\r\nVendôme, and Villars. Marshal Richelieu was supreme in the arts of\r\ngallantry, and more famous for conquests of love than of war. The best\r\ngenerals of Louis XV. were foreigners. Lowendal sprang from the royal\r\nhouse of Denmark; and Saxe, the best of all, was one of the three\r\nhundred and fifty-four bastards of Augustus the Strong, Elector of\r\nSaxony and King of Poland. He was now, 1750, dying at Chambord, his iron\r\nconstitution ruined by debaucheries.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of the Bourbon monarchy was complete. The government had\r\nbecome one great machine of centralized administration, with a king for\r\nits head; though a king who neither could nor would direct it. All\r\nstrife was over between the Crown and the nobles; feudalism was robbed\r\nof its vitality, and left the mere image of its former self, with\r\nnothing alive but its abuses, its caste privileges, its exactions, its\r\npride and vanity, its power to vex and oppress. In England, the nobility\r\nwere a living part of the nation, and if they had privileges, they paid\r\nfor them by constant service to the state; in France, they had no\r\npolitical life, and were separated from the people by sharp lines of\r\ndemarcation. From warrior chiefs, they had changed to courtiers. Those\r\nof them who could afford it, and many who could not, left their estates\r\nto the mercy of stewards, and gathered at Versailles to revolve about\r\nthe throne as glittering satellites, paid in pomp, empty distinctions,\r\nor rich sinecures, for the power they had lost. They ruined their\r\nvassals to support the extravagance by which they ruined themselves.\r\nSuch as stayed at home were objects of pity and scorn. \"Out of your\r\nMajesty's presence,\" said one of them, \"we are not only wretched, but\r\nridiculous.\"\r\n\r\nVersailles was like a vast and gorgeous theatre, where all were actors\r\nand spectators at once; and all played their parts to perfection. Here\r\nswarmed by thousands this silken nobility, whose ancestors rode cased in\r\niron. Pageant followed pageant. A picture of the time preserves for us\r\nan evening in the great hall of the Château, where the King, with piles\r\nof louis d'or before him, sits at a large oval green table, throwing the\r\ndice, among princes and princesses, dukes and duchesses, ambassadors,\r\nmarshals of France, and a vast throng of courtiers, like an animated bed\r\nof tulips; for men and women alike wear bright and varied colors. Above\r\nare the frescos of Le Brun; around are walls of sculptured and inlaid\r\nmarbles, with mirrors that reflect the restless splendors of the scene\r\nand the blaze of chandeliers, sparkling with crystal pendants. Pomp,\r\nmagnificence, profusion, were a business and a duty at the Court.\r\nVersailles was a gulf into which the labor of France poured its\r\nearnings; and it was never full.\r\n\r\nHere the graces and charms were a political power. Women had prodigious\r\ninfluence, and the two sexes were never more alike. Men not only dressed\r\nin colors, but they wore patches and carried muffs. The robust qualities\r\nof the old nobility still lingered among the exiles of the provinces,\r\nwhile at Court they had melted into refinements tainted with corruption.\r\nYet if the butterflies of Versailles had lost virility, they had not\r\nlost courage. They fought as gayly as they danced. In the halls which\r\nthey haunted of yore, turned now into a historical picture-gallery, one\r\nsees them still, on the canvas of Lenfant, Lepaon, or Vernet, facing\r\ndeath with careless gallantry, in their small three-cornered hats,\r\npowdered perukes, embroidered coats, and lace ruffles. Their valets\r\nserved them with ices in the trenches, under the cannon of besieged\r\ntowns. A troop of actors formed part of the army-train of Marshal Saxe.\r\nAt night there was a comedy, a ballet, or a ball, and in the morning a\r\nbattle. Saxe, however, himself a sturdy German, while he recognized\r\ntheir fighting value, and knew well how to make the best of it,\r\nsometimes complained that they were volatile, excitable, and difficult\r\nto manage.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the Court, with its pomps, luxuries, and wars, bore on the\r\nclasses least able to support it. The poorest were taxed most; the\r\nrichest not at all. The nobles, in the main, were free from imposts. The\r\nclergy, who had vast possessions, were wholly free, though they\r\nconsented to make voluntary gifts to the Crown; and when, in a time of\r\nemergency, the minister Machault required them, in common with all\r\nothers hitherto exempt, to contribute a twentieth of their revenues to\r\nthe charges of government, they passionately refused, declaring that\r\nthey would obey God rather than the King. The cultivators of the soil\r\nwere ground to the earth by a threefold extortion,--the seigniorial\r\ndues, the tithes of the Church, and the multiplied exactions of the\r\nCrown, enforced with merciless rigor by the farmers of the revenue, who\r\nenriched themselves by wringing the peasant on the one hand, and\r\ncheating the King on the other. A few great cities shone with all that\r\nis most brilliant in society, intellect, and concentrated wealth; while\r\nthe country that paid the costs lay in ignorance and penury, crushed and\r\ndespairing. Of the inhabitants of towns, too, the demands of the\r\ntax-gatherer were extreme; but here the immense vitality of the French\r\npeople bore up the burden. While agriculture languished, and intolerable\r\noppression turned peasants into beggars or desperadoes; while the clergy\r\nwere sapped by corruption, and the nobles enervated by luxury and ruined\r\nby extravagance, the middle class was growing in thrift and strength.\r\nArts and commerce prospered, and the seaports were alive with foreign\r\ntrade. Wealth tended from all sides towards the centre. The King did not\r\nlove his capital; but he and his favorites amused themselves with\r\nadorning it. Some of the chief embellishments that make Paris what it is\r\nto-day--the Place de la Concorde, the Champs Elysées, and many of the\r\npalaces of the Faubourg St. Germain--date from this reign.\r\n\r\nOne of the vicious conditions of the time was the separation in\r\nsympathies and interests of the four great classes of the\r\nnation,--clergy, nobles, burghers, and peasants; and each of these,\r\nagain, divided itself into incoherent fragments. France was an aggregate\r\nof disjointed parts, held together by a meshwork of arbitrary power,\r\nitself touched with decay. A disastrous blow was struck at the national\r\nwelfare when the Government of Louis XV. revived the odious persecution\r\nof the Huguenots. The attempt to scour heresy out of France cost her the\r\nmost industrious and virtuous part of her population, and robbed her of\r\nthose most fit to resist the mocking scepticism and turbid passions that\r\nburst out like a deluge with the Revolution.\r\n\r\nHer manifold ills were summed up in the King. Since the Valois, she had\r\nhad no monarch so worthless. He did not want understanding, still less\r\nthe graces of person. In his youth the people called him the\r\n\"Well-beloved;\" but by the middle of the century they so detested him\r\nthat he dared not pass through Paris, lest the mob should execrate him.\r\nHe had not the vigor of the true tyrant; but his langour, his hatred of\r\nall effort, his profound selfishness, his listless disregard of public\r\nduty, and his effeminate libertinism, mixed with superstitious devotion,\r\nmade him no less a national curse. Louis XIII. was equally unfit to\r\ngovern; but he gave the reins to the Great Cardinal. Louis XV. abandoned\r\nthem to a frivolous mistress, content that she should rule on condition\r\nof amusing him. It was a hard task; yet Madame de Pompadour accomplished\r\nit by methods infamous to him and to her. She gained and long kept the\r\npower that she coveted: filled the Bastille with her enemies; made and\r\nunmade ministers; appointed and removed generals. Great questions of\r\npolicy were at the mercy of her caprices. Through her frivolous vanity,\r\nher personal likes and dislikes, all the great departments of\r\ngovernment--army, navy, war, foreign affairs, justice, finance--changed\r\nfrom hand to hand incessantly, and this at a time of crisis when the\r\nkingdom needed the steadiest and surest guidance. Few of the officers of\r\nstate, except, perhaps, D'Argenson, could venture to disregard her. She\r\nturned out Orry, the comptroller-general, put her favorite, Machault,\r\ninto his place, then made him keeper of the seals, and at last minister\r\nof marine. The Marquis de Puysieux, in the ministry of foreign affairs,\r\nand the Comte de St.-Florentin, charged with the affairs of the clergy,\r\ntook their cue from her. The King stinted her in nothing. First and\r\nlast, she is reckoned to have cost him thirty-six million\r\nfrancs,--answering now to more than as many dollars.\r\n\r\nThe prestige of the monarchy was declining with the ideas that had given\r\nit life and strength. A growing disrespect for king, ministry, and\r\nclergy was beginning to prepare the catastrophe that was still some\r\nforty years in the future. While the valleys and low places of the\r\nkingdom were dark with misery and squalor, its heights were bright with\r\na gay society,--elegant, fastidious, witty,--craving the pleasures of\r\nthe mind as well as of the senses, criticising everything, analyzing\r\neverything, believing nothing. Voltaire was in the midst of it, hating,\r\nwith all his vehement soul, the abuses that swarmed about him, and\r\nassailing them with the inexhaustible shafts of his restless and\r\npiercing intellect. Montesquieu was showing to a despot-ridden age the\r\nprinciples of political freedom. Diderot and D'Alembert were beginning\r\ntheir revolutionary Encyclopaedia. Rousseau was sounding the first notes\r\nof his mad eloquence,--the wild revolt of a passionate and diseased\r\ngenius against a world of falsities and wrongs. The _salons_ of Paris,\r\ncloyed with other pleasures, alive to all that was racy and new,\r\nwelcomed the pungent doctrines, and played with them as children play\r\nwith fire, thinking no danger; as time went on, even embraced them in a\r\ngenuine spirit of hope and goodwill for humanity. The Revolution began\r\nat the top,--in the world of fashion, birth, and intellect,--and\r\npropagated itself downwards. \"We walked on a carpet of flowers,\" Count\r\nSégur afterwards said, \"unconscious that it covered an abyss;\" till the\r\ngulf yawned at last, and swallowed them.\r\n\r\nEastward, beyond the Rhine, lay the heterogeneous patchwork of the Holy\r\nRoman, or Germanic, Empire. The sacred bonds that throughout the Middle\r\nAges had held together its innumerable fragments, had lost their\r\nstrength. The Empire decayed as a whole; but not so the parts that\r\ncomposed it. In the south the House of Austria reigned over a formidable\r\nassemblage of states; and in the north the House of Brandenburg,\r\npromoted to royalty half a century before, had raised Prussia into an\r\nimportance far beyond her extent and population. In her dissevered rags\r\nof territory lay the destinies of Germany. It was the late King, that\r\nhonest, thrifty, dogged, headstrong despot, Frederic William, who had\r\nmade his kingdom what it was, trained it to the perfection of drill, and\r\nleft it to his son, Frederic II. the best engine of war in Europe.\r\nFrederic himself had passed between the upper and nether millstones of\r\npaternal discipline. Never did prince undergo such an apprenticeship.\r\nHis father set him to the work of an overseer, or steward, flung plates\r\nat his head in the family circle, thrashed him with his rattan in\r\npublic, bullied him for submitting to such treatment, and imprisoned him\r\nfor trying to run away from it. He came at last out of purgatory; and\r\nEurope felt him to her farthest bounds. This bookish, philosophizing,\r\nverse-making cynic and profligate was soon to approve himself the first\r\nwarrior of his time, and one of the first of all time.\r\n\r\nAnother power had lately risen on the European world. Peter the Great,\r\nhalf hero, half savage, had roused the inert barbarism of Russia into a\r\ntitanic life. His daughter Elizabeth had succeeded to his\r\nthrone,--heiress of his sensuality, if not of his talents.\r\n\r\nOver all the Continent the aspect of the times was the same. Power had\r\neverywhere left the plains and the lower slopes, and gathered at the\r\nsummits. Popular life was at a stand. No great idea stirred the nations\r\nto their depths. The religious convulsions of the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries were over, and the earthquake of the French\r\nRevolution had not begun. At the middle of the eighteenth century the\r\nhistory of Europe turned on the balance of power; the observance of\r\ntreaties; inheritance and succession; rivalries of sovereign houses\r\nstruggling to win power or keep it, encroach on neighbors, or prevent\r\nneighbors from encroaching; bargains, intrigue, force, diplomacy, and\r\nthe musket, in the interest not of peoples but of rulers. Princes, great\r\nand small, brooded over some real or fancied wrong, nursed some dubious\r\nclaim born of a marriage, a will, or an ancient covenant fished out of\r\nthe abyss of time, and watched their moment to make it good. The general\r\nopportunity came when, in 1740, the Emperor Charles VI. died and\r\nbequeathed his personal dominions of the House of Austria to his\r\ndaughter, Maria Theresa. The chief Powers of Europe had been pledged in\r\nadvance to sustain the will; and pending the event, the veteran Prince\r\nEugene had said that two hundred thousand soldiers would be worth all\r\ntheir guaranties together. The two hundred thousand were not there, and\r\nnot a sovereign kept his word. They flocked to share the spoil, and\r\nparcel out the motley heritage of the young Queen. Frederic of Prussia\r\nled the way, invaded her province of Silesia, seized it, and kept it.\r\nThe Elector of Bavaria and the King of Spain claimed their share, and\r\nthe Elector of Saxony and the King of Sardinia prepared to follow the\r\nexample. France took part with Bavaria, and intrigued to set the\r\nimperial crown on the head of the Elector, thinking to ruin her old\r\nenemy, the House of Austria, and rule Germany through an emperor too\r\nweak to dispense with her support. England, jealous of her designs,\r\ntrembling for the balance of power, and anxious for the Hanoverian\r\npossessions of her king, threw herself into the strife on the side of\r\nAustria. It was now that, in the Diet at Presburg, the beautiful and\r\ndistressed Queen, her infant in her arms, made her memorable appeal to\r\nthe wild chivalry of her Hungarian nobles; and, clashing their swords,\r\nthey shouted with one voice: \"Let us die for our king, Maria Theresa;\"\r\n_Moriamur pro rege nostro, Mariâ_,--one of the most dramatic scenes in\r\nhistory; not quite true, perhaps, but near the truth. Then came that\r\nconfusion worse confounded called the war of the Austrian Succession,\r\nwith its Mollwitz, its Dettingen, its Fontenoy, and its Scotch episode\r\nof Culloden. The peace of Aix-la-Chapelle closed the strife in 1748.\r\nEurope had time to breathe; but the germs of discord remained alive.\r\n\r\nThe American Combatants\r\n\r\nThe French claimed all America, from the Alleghanies to the Rocky\r\nMountains, and from Mexico and Florida to the North Pole, except only\r\nthe ill-defined possessions of the English on the borders of Hudson Bay;\r\nand to these vast regions, with adjacent islands, they gave the general\r\nname of New France. They controlled the highways of the continent, for\r\nthey held its two great rivers. First, they had seized the St. Lawrence,\r\nand then planted themselves at the mouth of the Mississippi. Canada at\r\nthe north, and Louisiana at the south, were the keys of a boundless\r\ninterior, rich with incalculable possibilities. The English colonies,\r\nranged along the Atlantic coast, had no royal road to the great inland,\r\nand were, in a manner, shut between the mountains and the sea. At the\r\nmiddle of the century they numbered in all, from Georgia to Maine, about\r\neleven hundred and sixty thousand white inhabitants. By the census of\r\n1754 Canada had but fifty-five thousand.[1] Add those of Louisiana and\r\nAcadia, and the whole white population under the French flag might be\r\nsomething more than eighty thousand. Here is an enormous disparity; and\r\nhence it has been argued that the success of the English colonies and\r\nthe failure of the French was not due to difference of religious and\r\npolitical systems, but simply to numerical preponderance. But this\r\npreponderance itself grew out of a difference of systems. We have said\r\nbefore, and it cannot be said too often, that in making Canada a citadel\r\nof the state religion--a holy of holies of exclusive Roman Catholic\r\northodoxy,--the clerical monitors of the Crown robbed their country of a\r\ntrans-Atlantic empire. New France could not grow with a priest on guard\r\nat the gate to let in none but such as pleased him. One of the ablest of\r\nCanadian governors, La Galissonière, seeing the feebleness of the colony\r\ncompared with the vastness of its claims, advised the King to send ten\r\nthousand peasants to occupy the valley of the Ohio, and hold back the\r\nBritish swarm that was just then pushing its advance-guard over the\r\nAlleghanies. It needed no effort of the King to people his waste domain,\r\nnot with ten thousand peasants, but with twenty times ten thousand\r\nFrenchmen of every station,--the most industrious, most instructed, most\r\ndisciplined by adversity and capable of self-rule, that the country\r\ncould boast. While La Galissonière was asking for colonists, the agents\r\nof the Crown, set on by priestly fanaticism, or designing selfishness\r\nmasked with fanaticism, were pouring volleys of musketry into Huguenot\r\ncongregations, imprisoning for life those innocent of all but their\r\nfaith,--the men in the galleys, the women in the pestiferous dungeons of\r\nAigues Mortes,--hanging their ministers, kidnapping their children, and\r\nreviving, in short, the dragonnades. Now, as in the past century, many\r\nof the victims escaped to the British colonies, and became a part of\r\nthem. The Huguenots would have hailed as a boon the permission to\r\nemigrate under the fleur-de-lis, and build up a Protestant France in the\r\nvalleys of the West. It would have been a bane of absolutism, but a\r\nnational glory; would have set bounds to English colonization, and\r\nchanged the face of the continent. The opportunity was spurned. The\r\ndominant Church clung to its policy of rule and ruin. France built its\r\nbest colony on a principle of exclusion, and failed; England reversed\r\nthe system, and succeeded.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Censuses of Canada_, iv. 61. Rameau _(La France aux\r\nColonies,_ ii. 81) estimates the Canadian population, in 1755, at\r\nsixty-six thousand, besides _voyageurs_, Indian traders, etc. Vaudreuil,\r\nin 1760, places it at seventy thousand.]\r\n\r\nI have shown elsewhere the aspects of Canada, where a rigid scion of the\r\nold European tree was set to grow in the wilderness. The military\r\nGovernor, holding his miniature Court on the rock of Quebec; the feudal\r\nproprietors, whose domains lined the shores of the St. Lawrence; the\r\npeasant; the roving bushranger; the half-tamed savage, with crucifix and\r\nscalping-knife; priests; friars; nuns; and soldiers,--mingled to form a\r\nsociety the most picturesque on the continent. What distinguished it\r\nfrom the France that produced it was a total absence of revolt against\r\nthe laws of its being,--an absolute conservatism, an unquestioning\r\nacceptance of Church and King. The Canadian, ignorant of everything but\r\nwhat the priest saw fit to teach him, had never heard of Voltaire; and\r\nif he had known him, would have thought him a devil. He had, it is true,\r\na spirit of insubordination born of the freedom of the forest; but if\r\nhis instincts rebelled, his mind and soul were passively submissive. The\r\nunchecked control of a hierarchy robbed him of the independence of\r\nintellect and character, without which, under the conditions of modern\r\nlife, a people must resign itself to a position of inferiority. Yet\r\nCanada had a vigor of her own. It was not in spiritual deference only\r\nthat she differed from the country of her birth. Whatever she had caught\r\nof its corruptions, she had caught nothing of its effeminacy. The mass\r\nof her people lived in a rude poverty,--not abject, like the peasant of\r\nold France, nor ground down by the tax-gatherer; while those of the\r\nhigher ranks--all more or less engaged in pursuits of war or adventure,\r\nand inured to rough journeyings and forest exposures--were rugged as\r\ntheir climate. Even the French regular troops, sent out to defend the\r\ncolony, caught its hardy spirit, and set an example of stubborn fighting\r\nwhich their comrades at home did not always emulate.\r\n\r\nCanada lay ensconced behind rocks and forests. All along her southern\r\nboundaries, between her and her English foes, lay a broad tract of\r\nwilderness, shaggy with primeval woods. Innumerable streams gurgled\r\nbeneath their shadows; innumerable lakes gleamed in the fiery sunsets;\r\ninnumerable mountains bared their rocky foreheads to the wind. These\r\nwastes were ranged by her savage allies, Micmacs, Etechémins, Abenakis,\r\nCaughnawagas; and no enemy could steal upon her unawares. Through the\r\nmidst of them stretched Lake Champlain, pointing straight to the heart\r\nof the British settlement,--a watery thoroughfare of mutual attack, and\r\nthe only approach by which, without a long _détour_ by wilderness or\r\nsea, a hostile army could come within striking distance of the colony.\r\nThe French advanced post of Fort Frederic, called Crown Point by the\r\nEnglish, barred the narrows of the lake, which thence spread northward\r\nto the portals of Canada guarded by Fort St. Jean. Southwestward, some\r\nfourteen hundred miles as a bird flies, and twice as far by the\r\npracticable routes of travel, was Louisiana, the second of the two heads\r\nof New France; while between lay the realms of solitude where the\r\nMississippi rolled its sullen tide, and the Ohio wound its belt of\r\nsilver through the verdant woodlands.\r\n\r\nTo whom belonged this world of prairies and forests? France claimed it\r\nby right of discovery and occupation. It was her explorers who, after De\r\nSoto, first set foot on it. The question of right, it is true, mattered\r\nlittle; for, right or wrong, neither claimant would yield her\r\npretensions so long as she had strength to uphold them; yet one point is\r\nworth a moment's notice. The French had established an excellent system\r\nin the distribution of their American lands. Whoever received a grant\r\nfrom the Crown was required to improve it, and this within reasonable\r\ntime. If he did not, the land ceased to be his, and was given to another\r\nmore able or industrious. An international extension of her own\r\nprinciple would have destroyed the pretensions of France to all the\r\ncountries of the West. She had called them hers for three fourths of a\r\ncentury, and they were still a howling waste, yielding nothing to\r\ncivilization but beaver-skins, with here and there a fort, trading-post,\r\nor mission, and three or four puny hamlets by the Mississippi and the\r\nDetroit. We have seen how she might have made for herself an\r\nindisputable title, and peopled the solitudes with a host to maintain\r\nit. She would not; others were at hand who both would and could; and the\r\nlate claimant, disinherited and forlorn, would soon be left to count the\r\ncost of her bigotry.\r\n\r\nThe thirteen British colonies were alike, insomuch as they all had\r\nrepresentative governments, and a basis of English law. But the\r\ndifferences among them were great. Some were purely English; others were\r\nmade up of various races, though the Anglo-Saxon was always predominant.\r\nSome had one prevailing religious creed; others had many creeds. Some\r\nhad charters, and some had not. In most cases the governor was appointed\r\nby the Crown; in Pennsylvania and Maryland he was appointed by a feudal\r\nproprietor, and in Connecticut and Rhode Island he was chosen by the\r\npeople. The differences of disposition and character were still greater\r\nthan those of form.\r\n\r\nThe four northern colonies, known collectively as New England, were an\r\nexception to the general rule of diversity. The smallest, Rhode Island,\r\nhad features all its own; but the rest were substantially one in nature\r\nand origin. The principal among them, Massachusetts, may serve as the\r\ntype of all. It was a mosaic of little village republics, firmly\r\ncemented together, and formed into a single body politic through\r\nrepresentatives sent to the \"General Court\" at Boston. Its government,\r\noriginally theocratic, now tended to democracy, ballasted as yet by\r\nstrong traditions of respect for established worth and ability, as well\r\nas by the influence of certain families prominent in affairs for\r\ngenerations. Yet there were no distinct class-lines, and popular power,\r\nlike popular education, was widely diffused. Practically Massachusetts\r\nwas almost independent of the mother-country. Its people were purely\r\nEnglish, of sound yeoman stock, with an abundant leaven drawn from the\r\nbest of the Puritan gentry; but their original character had been\r\nsomewhat modified by changed conditions of life. A harsh and exacting\r\ncreed, with its stiff formalism and its prohibition of wholesome\r\nrecreation; excess in the pursuit of gain--the only resource left to\r\nenergies robbed of their natural play; the struggle for existence on a\r\nhard and barren soil; and the isolation of a narrow village\r\nlife,--joined to produce, in the meaner sort, qualities which were\r\nunpleasant, and sometimes repulsive. Puritanism was not an unmixed\r\nblessing. Its view of human nature was dark, and its attitude towards it\r\none of repression. It strove to crush out not only what is evil, but\r\nmuch that is innocent and salutary. Human nature so treated will take\r\nits revenge, and for every vice that it loses find another instead.\r\nNevertheless, while New England Puritanism bore its peculiar crop of\r\nfaults, it produced also many good and sound fruits. An uncommon vigor,\r\njoined to the hardy virtues of a masculine race, marked the New England\r\ntype. The sinews, it is true, were hardened at the expense of blood and\r\nflesh,--and this literally as well as figuratively; but the staple of\r\ncharacter was a sturdy conscientiousness, an undespairing courage,\r\npatriotism, public spirit, sagacity, and a strong good sense. A great\r\nchange, both for better and for worse, has since come over it, due\r\nlargely to reaction against the unnatural rigors of the past. That\r\nmixture, which is now too common, of cool emotions with excitable\r\nbrains, was then rarely seen. The New England colonies abounded in high\r\nexamples of public and private virtue, though not always under the most\r\nprepossessing forms. They were conspicuous, moreover, for intellectual\r\nactivity, and were by no means without intellectual eminence.\r\nMassachusetts had produced at least two men whose fame had crossed the\r\nsea,--Edwards, who out of the grim theology of Calvin mounted to sublime\r\nheights of mystical speculation; and Franklin, famous already by his\r\ndiscoveries in electricity. On the other hand, there were few genuine\r\nNew Englanders who, however personally modest, could divest themselves\r\nof the notion that they belonged to a people in an especial manner the\r\nobject of divine approval; and this self-righteousness, along with\r\ncertain other traits, failed to commend the Puritan colonies to the\r\nfavor of their fellows. Then, as now, New England was best known to her\r\nneighbors by her worst side.\r\n\r\nIn one point, however, she found general applause. She was regarded as\r\nthe most military among the British colonies. This reputation was well\r\nfounded, and is easily explained. More than all the rest, she lay open\r\nto attack. The long waving line of the New England border, with its\r\nlonely hamlets and scattered farms, extended from the Kennebec to beyond\r\nthe Connecticut, and was everywhere vulnerable to the guns and\r\ntomahawks of the neighboring French and their savage allies. The\r\ncolonies towards the south had thus far been safe from danger. New York\r\nalone was within striking distance of the Canadian war-parties. That\r\nprovince then consisted of a line of settlements up the Hudson and the\r\nMohawk, and was little exposed to attack except at its northern end,\r\nwhich was guarded by the fortified town of Albany, with its outlying\r\nposts, and by the friendly and warlike Mohawks, whose \"castles\" were\r\nclose at hand. Thus New England had borne the heaviest brunt of the\r\npreceding wars, not only by the forest, but also by the sea; for the\r\nFrench of Acadia and Cape Breton confronted her coast, and she was often\r\nat blows with them. Fighting had been a necessity with her, and she had\r\nmet the emergency after a method extremely defective, but the best that\r\ncircumstances would permit. Having no trained officers and no\r\ndisciplined soldiers, and being too poor to maintain either, she\r\nborrowed her warriors from the workshop and the plough, and officered\r\nthem with lawyers, merchants, mechanics, or farmers. To compare them\r\nwith good regular troops would be folly; but they did, on the whole,\r\nbetter than could have been expected, and in the last war achieved the\r\nbrilliant success of the capture of Louisburg. This exploit, due partly\r\nto native hardihood and partly to good luck, greatly enhanced the\r\nmilitary repute of New England, or rather was one of the chief sources\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nThe great colony of Virginia stood in strong contrast to New England. In\r\nboth the population was English; but the one was Puritan with Roundhead\r\ntraditions, and the other, so far as concerned its governing class,\r\nAnglican with Cavalier traditions. In the one, every man, woman, and\r\nchild could read and write; in the other, Sir William Berkeley once\r\nthanked God that there were no free schools, and no prospect of any for\r\na century. The hope had found fruition. The lower classes of Virginia\r\nwere as untaught as the warmest friend of popular ignorance could wish.\r\nNew England had a native literature more than respectable under the\r\ncircumstances, while Virginia had none; numerous industries, while\r\nVirginia was all agriculture, with but a single crop; a homogeneous\r\nsociety and a democratic spirit, while her rival was an aristocracy.\r\nVirginian society was distinctively stratified. On the lowest level were\r\nthe negro slaves, nearly as numerous as all the rest together; next, the\r\nindented servants and the poor whites, of low origin, good-humored, but\r\nboisterous, and some times vicious; next, the small and despised class\r\nof tradesmen and mechanics; next, the farmers and lesser planters, who\r\nwere mainly of good English stock, and who merged insensibly into the\r\nruling class of the great landowners. It was these last who represented\r\nthe colony and made the laws. They may be described as English country\r\nsquires transplanted to a warm climate and turned slave-masters. They\r\nsustained their position by entails, and constantly undermined it by the\r\nreckless profusion which ruined them at last. Many of them were well\r\nborn, with an immense pride of descent, increased by the habit of\r\ndomination. Indolent and energetic by turns; rich in natural gifts and\r\noften poor in book-learning, though some, in the lack of good teaching\r\nat home, had been bred in the English universities; high-spirited,\r\ngenerous to a fault; keeping open house in their capacious mansions,\r\namong vast tobacco-fields and toiling negroes, and living in a rude pomp\r\nwhere the fashions of St. James were somewhat oddly grafted on the\r\nroughness of the plantation,--what they wanted in schooling was supplied\r\nby an education which books alone would have been impotent to give, the\r\neducation which came with the possession and exercise of political\r\npower, and the sense of a position to maintain, joined to a bold spirit\r\nof independence and a patriotic attachment to the Old Dominion. They\r\nwere few in number; they raced, gambled, drank, and swore; they did\r\neverything that in Puritan eyes was most reprehensible; and in the day\r\nof need they gave the United Colonies a body of statesmen and orators\r\nwhich had no equal on the continent. A vigorous aristocracy favors the\r\ngrowth of personal eminence, even in those who are not of it, but only\r\nnear it.\r\n\r\nThe essential antagonism of Virginia and New England was afterwards to\r\nbecome, and to remain for a century, an element of the first influence\r\nin American history. Each might have learned much from the other; but\r\nneither did so till, at last, the strife of their contending principles\r\nshook the continent. Pennsylvania differed widely from both. She was a\r\nconglomerate of creeds and races,--English, Irish, Germans, Dutch, and\r\nSwedes; Quakers, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Romanists, Moravians, and a\r\nvariety of nondescript sects. The Quakers prevailed in the eastern\r\ndistricts; quiet, industrious, virtuous, and serenely obstinate. The\r\nGermans were strongest towards the centre of the colony, and were\r\nchiefly peasants; successful farmers, but dull, ignorant, and\r\nsuperstitious. Towards the west were the Irish, of whom some were\r\nCelts, always quarrelling with their German neighbors, who detested\r\nthem; but the greater part were Protestants of Scotch descent, from\r\nUlster; a vigorous border population. Virginia and New England had each\r\na strong distinctive character. Pennsylvania, with her heterogeneous\r\npopulation, had none but that which she owed to the sober neutral tints\r\nof Quaker existence. A more thriving colony there was not on the\r\ncontinent. Life, if monotonous, was smooth and contented. Trade and the\r\narts grew. Philadelphia, next to Boston, was the largest town in British\r\nAmerica; and was, moreover, the intellectual centre of the middle and\r\nsouthern colonies. Unfortunately, for her credit in the approaching war,\r\nthe Quaker influence made Pennsylvania non-combatant. Politically, too,\r\nshe was an anomaly; for, though utterly unfeudal in disposition and\r\ncharacter, she was under feudal superiors in the persons of the\r\nrepresentatives of William Penn, the original grantee.\r\n\r\nNew York had not as yet reached the relative prominence which her\r\ngeographical position and inherent strength afterwards gave her. The\r\nEnglish, joined to the Dutch, the original settlers, were the dominant\r\npopulation; but a half-score of other languages were spoken in the\r\nprovince, the chief among them being that of the Huguenot French in the\r\nsouthern parts, and that of the Germans on the Mohawk. In religion, the\r\nprovince was divided between the Anglican Church, with government\r\nsupport and popular dislike, and numerous dissenting sects, chiefly\r\nLutherans, Independents, Presbyterians, and members of the Dutch\r\nReformed Church. The little city of New York, like its great successor,\r\nwas the most cosmopolitan place on the continent, and probably the\r\ngayest. It had, in abundance, balls, concerts, theatricals, and evening\r\nclubs, with plentiful dances and other amusements, for the poorer\r\nclasses. Thither in the winter months came the great hereditary\r\nproprietors on the Hudson; for the old Dutch feudality still held its\r\nown, and the manors of Van Renselaer, Cortland, and Livingston, with\r\ntheir seigniorial privileges, and the great estates and numerous\r\ntenantry of the Schuylers and other leading families, formed the basis\r\nof an aristocracy, some of whose members had done good service to the\r\nprovince, and were destined to do more. Pennsylvania was feudal in form,\r\nand not in spirit; Virginia in spirit, and not in form; New England in\r\nneither; and New York largely in both. This social crystallization had,\r\nit is true, many opponents. In politics, as in religion, there were\r\nsharp antagonisms and frequent quarrels. They centred in the city; for\r\nin the well-stocked dwellings of the Dutch farmers along the Hudson\r\nthere reigned a tranquil and prosperous routine; and the Dutch border\r\ntown of Albany had not its like in America for unruffled conservatism\r\nand quaint picturesqueness.\r\n\r\nOf the other colonies, the briefest mention will suffice: New Jersey,\r\nwith its wholesome population of farmers; tobacco-growing Maryland,\r\nwhich, but for its proprietary government and numerous Roman Catholics,\r\nmight pass for another Virginia, inferior in growth, and less decisive\r\nin features; Delaware, a modest appendage of Pennsylvania; wild and rude\r\nNorth Carolina; and, farther on, South Carolina and Georgia, too remote\r\nfrom the seat of war to take a noteworthy part in it. The attitude of\r\nthese various colonies towards each other is hardly conceivable to an\r\nAmerican of the present time. They had no political tie except a common\r\nallegiance to the British Crown. Communication between them was\r\ndifficult and slow, by rough roads traced often through primeval\r\nforests. Between some of them there was less of sympathy than of\r\njealousy kindled by conflicting interests or perpetual disputes\r\nconcerning boundaries. The patriotism of the colonist was bounded by the\r\nlines of his government, except in the compact and kindred colonies of\r\nNew England, which were socially united, through politically distinct.\r\nThe country of the New Yorker was New York, and the country of the\r\nVirginian was Virginia. The New England colonies had once confederated;\r\nbut, kindred as they were, they had long ago dropped apart. William Penn\r\nproposed a plan of colonial union wholly fruitless. James II. tried to\r\nunite all the northern colonies under one government; but the attempt\r\ncame to naught. Each stood aloof, jealously independent. At rare\r\nintervals, under the pressure of an emergency, some of them would try to\r\nact in concert; and, except in New England, the results had been most\r\ndiscouraging. Nor was it this segregation only that unfitted them for\r\nwar. They were all subject to popular legislatures, through whom alone\r\nmoney and men could be raised; and these elective bodies were sometimes\r\nfactious and selfish, and not always either far-sighted or reasonable.\r\nMoreover, they were in a state of ceaseless friction with their\r\ngovernors, who represented the king, or, what was worse, the feudal\r\nproprietary. These disputes, though varying in intensity, were found\r\neverywhere except in the two small colonies which chose their own\r\ngovernors; and they were premonitions of the movement towards\r\nindependence which ended in the war of Revolution. The occasion of\r\ndifference mattered little. Active or latent, the quarrel was always\r\npresent. In New York it turned on a question of the governor's salary;\r\nin Pennsylvania on the taxation of the proprietary estates; in Virginia\r\non a fee exacted for the issue of land patents. It was sure to arise\r\nwhenever some public crisis gave the representatives of the people an\r\nopportunity of extorting concessions from the representative of the\r\nCrown, or gave the representative of the Crown an opportunity to gain a\r\npoint for prerogative. That is to say, the time when action was most\r\nneeded was the time chosen for obstructing it.\r\n\r\nIn Canada there was no popular legislature to embarrass the central\r\npower. The people, like an army, obeyed the word of command,--a military\r\nadvantage beyond all price.\r\n\r\nDivided in government; divided in origin, feelings, and principles;\r\njealous of each other, jealous of the Crown; the people at war with the\r\nexecutive, and, by the fermentation of internal politics, blinded to an\r\noutward danger that seemed remote and vague,--such were the conditions\r\nunder which the British colonies drifted into a war that was to decide\r\nthe fate of the continent.\r\n\r\nThis war was the strife of a united and concentred few against a divided\r\nand discordant many. It was the strife, too, of the past against the\r\nfuture; of the old against the new; of moral and intellectual torpor\r\nagainst moral and intellectual life; of barren absolutism against a\r\nliberty, crude, incoherent, and chaotic, yet full of prolific vitality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\n1749-1752\r\n\r\nCéleron de Bienville\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle was signed, the Marquis de la\r\nGalissonière ruled over Canada. Like all the later Canadian governors,\r\nhe was a naval officer; and, a few years after, he made himself famous\r\nby a victory, near Minorca, over the English admiral Byng,--an\r\nachievement now remembered chiefly by the fate of the defeated\r\ncommander, judicially murdered as the scapegoat of an imbecile ministry.\r\nGalissonière was a humpback; but his deformed person was animated by a\r\nbold spirit and a strong and penetrating intellect. He was the chief\r\nrepresentative of the American policy of France. He felt that, cost what\r\nit might, she must hold fast to Canada, and link her to Louisiana by\r\nchains of forts strong enough to hold back the British colonies, and\r\ncramp their growth by confinement within narrow limits; while French\r\nsettlers, sent from the mother-country, should spread and multiply in\r\nthe broad valleys of the interior. It is true, he said, that Canada and\r\nher dependencies have always been a burden; but they are necessary as a\r\nbarrier against English ambition; and to abandon them is to abandon\r\nourselves; for if we suffer our enemies to become masters in America,\r\ntheir trade and naval power will grow to vast proportions, and they will\r\ndraw from their colonies a wealth that will make them preponderant in\r\nEurope.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: La Galissonière, _Mémoire sur les Colonies de la France\r\ndans l'Amêrique septentrionale_.]\r\n\r\nThe treaty had done nothing to settle the vexed question of boundaries\r\nbetween France and her rival. It had but staved off the inevitable\r\nconflict. Meanwhile, the English traders were crossing the mountains\r\nfrom Pennsylvania and Virginia, poaching on the domain which France\r\nclaimed as hers, ruining the French fur-trade, seducing the Indian\r\nallies of Canada, and stirring them up against her. Worse still, English\r\nland speculators were beginning to follow. Something must be done, and\r\nthat promptly, to drive back the intruders, and vindicate French rights\r\nin the valley of the Ohio. To this end the Governor sent Céloron de\r\nBienville thither in the summer of 1749.\r\n\r\nHe was a chevalier de St. Louis and a captain in the colony troops.\r\nUnder him went fourteen officers and cadets, twenty soldiers, a hundred\r\nand eighty Canadians, and a band of Indians, all in twenty-three\r\nbirch-bark canoes. They left La Chine on the fifteenth of June, and\r\npushed up the rapids of the St. Lawrence, losing a man and damaging\r\nseveral canoes on the way. Ten days brought them to the mouth of the\r\nOswegatchie, where Ogdensburg now stands. Here they found a Sulpitian\r\npriest, Abbé Piquet, busy at building a fort, and lodging for the\r\npresent under a shed of bark like an Indian. This enterprising father,\r\nostensibly a missionary, was in reality a zealous political agent, bent\r\non winning over the red allies of the English, retrieving French\r\nprestige, and restoring French trade. Thus far he had attracted but two\r\nIroquois to his new establishment; and these he lent to Céloron.\r\n\r\nReaching Lake Ontario, the party stopped for a time at the French fort\r\nof Frontenac, but avoided the rival English post of Oswego, on the\r\nsouthern shore, where a trade in beaver skins, disastrous to French\r\ninterests, was carried on, and whither many tribes, once faithful to\r\nCanada, now made resort. On the sixth of July Céloron reached Niagara.\r\nThis, the most important pass of all the western wilderness, was guarded\r\nby a small fort of palisades on the point where the river joins the\r\nlake. Thence, the party carried their canoes over the portage road by\r\nthe cataract, and launched them upon Lake Erie. On the fifteenth they\r\nlanded on the lonely shore where the town of Portland now stands; and\r\nfor the next seven days were busied in shouldering canoes and baggage up\r\nand down the steep hills, through the dense forest of beech, oak, ash,\r\nand elm, to the waters of Chautauqua Lake, eight or nine miles distant.\r\nHere they embarked again, steering southward over the sunny waters, in\r\nthe stillness and solitude of the leafy hills, till they came to the\r\noutlet, and glided down the peaceful current in the shade of the tall\r\nforests that overarched it. This prosperity was short. The stream was\r\nlow, in spite of heavy rains that had drenched them on the carrying\r\nplace. Father Bonnecamp, chaplain of the expedition, wrote, in his\r\nJournal: \"In some places--and they were but too frequent--the water was\r\nonly two or three inches deep; and we were reduced to the sad necessity\r\nof dragging our canoes over the sharp pebbles, which, with all our care\r\nand precaution, stripped off large slivers of the bark. At last, tired\r\nand worn, and almost in despair of ever seeing La Belle Rivière, we\r\nentered it at noon of the 29th.\" The part of the Ohio, or \"La Belle\r\nRivière,\" which they had thus happily reached, is now called the\r\nAlleghany. The Great West lay outspread before them, a realm of wild and\r\nwaste fertility.\r\n\r\nFrench America had two heads,--one among the snows of Canada, and one\r\namong the canebrakes of Louisiana; one communicating with the world\r\nthrough the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the other through the Gulf of\r\nMexico. These vital points were feebly connected by a chain of military\r\nposts,--slender, and often interrupted,--circling through the wilderness\r\nnearly three thousand miles. Midway between Canada and Louisiana lay the\r\nvalley of the Ohio. If the English should seize it, they would sever the\r\nchain of posts, and cut French America asunder. If the French held it,\r\nand entrenched themselves well along its eastern limits, they would shut\r\ntheir rivals between the Alleghanies and the sea, control all the tribes\r\nof the West, and turn them, in case of war, against the English\r\nborders,--a frightful and insupportable scourge.\r\n\r\nThe Indian population of the Ohio and its northern tributaries was\r\nrelatively considerable. The upper or eastern half of the valley was\r\noccupied by mingled hordes of Delawares, Shawanoes, Wyandots, and\r\nIroquois, or Indians of the Five Nations, who had migrated thither from\r\ntheir ancestral abodes within the present limits of the State of New\r\nYork, and who were called Mingoes by the English traders. Along with\r\nthem were a few wandering Abenakis, Nipissings, and Ottawas. Farther\r\nwest, on the waters of the Miami, the Wabash, and other neighboring\r\nstreams, was the seat of a confederacy formed of the various bands of\r\nthe Miamis and their kindred or affiliated tribes. Still farther west,\r\ntowards the Mississippi, were the remnants of the Illinois.\r\n\r\nFrance had done but little to make good her claims to this grand domain.\r\nEast of the Miami she had no military post whatever. Westward, on the\r\nMaumee, there was a small wooden fort, another on the St. Joseph, and\r\ntwo on the Wabash. On the meadows of the Mississippi, in the Illinois\r\ncountry, stood Fort Chartres,--a much stronger work, and one of the\r\nchief links of the chain that connected Quebec with New Orleans. Its\r\nfour stone bastions were impregnable to musketry; and, here in the\r\ndepths of the wilderness, there was no fear that cannon would be brought\r\nagainst it. It was the centre and citadel of a curious little forest\r\nsettlement, the only vestige of civilization through all this region. At\r\nKaskaskia, extended along the borders of the stream, were seventy or\r\neighty French houses; thirty or forty at Cahokia, opposite the site of\r\nSt. Louis; and a few more at the intervening hamlets of St. Philippe and\r\nPrairie à la Roche,--a picturesque but thriftless population, mixed with\r\nIndians, totally ignorant, busied partly with the fur-trade, and partly\r\nwith the raising of corn for the market of New Orleans. They\r\ncommunicated with it by means of a sort of row galley, of eighteen or\r\ntwenty oars, which made the voyage twice a year, and usually spent ten\r\nweeks on the return up the river.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Gordon, _Journal_, 1766, appended to Pownall,\r\n_Topographical Description_. In the Dépôt des Cartes de la Marine at\r\nParis, C. 4,040, are two curious maps of the Illinois colony, made a\r\nlittle after the middle of the century. In 1753 the Marquis Duquesne\r\ndenounced the colonists as debauched and lazy.]\r\n\r\nThe Pope and the Bourbons had claimed this wilderness for seventy years,\r\nand had done scarcely more for it than the Indians, its natural owners.\r\nOf the western tribes, even of those living at the French posts, the\r\nHurons or Wyandots alone were Christian.[4] The devoted zeal of the\r\nearly missionaries and the politic efforts of their successors had\r\nfailed alike. The savages of the Ohio and the Mississippi, instead of\r\nbeing tied to France by the mild bonds of the faith, were now in a state\r\nwhich the French called defection or revolt; that is, they received and\r\nwelcomed the English traders.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: \"De toutes les nations domiciliées dans les postes des pays\r\nd'en haut, il n'y a que les hurons du détroit qui aient embrassé la\r\nRéligion chretienne.\" _Mémoirs du Roy pour servir d'instruction au S'r.\r\nMarqius de Lajonquière_.]\r\n\r\nThese traders came in part from Virginia, but chiefly from Pennsylvania.\r\nDinwiddie, governor of Virginia, says of them: \"They appear to me to be\r\nin general a set of abandoned wretches;\" and Hamilton, governor of\r\nPennsylvania, replies: \"I concur with you in opinion that they are a\r\nvery licentious people.[5] Indian traders, of whatever nation, are\r\nrarely models of virtue; and these, without doubt, were rough and\r\nlawless men, with abundant blackguardism and few scruples. Not all of\r\nthem, however, are to be thus qualified. Some were of a better stamp;\r\namong whom were Christopher Gist, William Trent, and George Croghan.\r\nThese and other chief traders hired men on the frontiers, crossed the\r\nAlleghanies with goods packed on the backs of horses, descended into the\r\nvalley of the Ohio, and journeyed from stream to stream and village to\r\nvillage along the Indian trails, with which all this wilderness was\r\nseamed, and which the traders widened to make them practicable. More\r\nrarely, they carried their goods on horses to the upper waters of the\r\nOhio, and embarked them in large wooden canoes, in which they descended\r\nthe main river, and ascended such of its numerous tributaries as were\r\nnavigable. They were bold and enterprising; and French writers, with\r\nalarm and indignation, declare that some of them had crossed the\r\nMississippi and traded with the distant Osages. It is said that about\r\nthree hundred of them came over the mountains every year.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Dinwiddie to Hamilton, 21 May, 1753. Hamilton to\r\nDinwiddie,--May, 1753._]\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Alleghany, Céleron de Bienville entered upon the work\r\nassigned him, and began by taking possession of the country. The men\r\nwere drawn up in order; Louis XV. was proclaimed lord of all that\r\nregion, the arms of France, stamped on a sheet of tin, were nailed to a\r\ntree, a plate of lead was buried at its foot, and the notary of the\r\nexpedition drew up a formal act of the whole proceeding. The leaden\r\nplate was inscribed as follows: \"Year 1749, in the reign of Louis\r\nFifteenth, King of France. We, Céleron, commanding the detachment sent\r\nby the Marquis de la Galissonière, commander-general of New France, to\r\nrestore tranquillity in certain villages of these cantons, have buried\r\nthis plate at the confluence of the Ohio and the Kanaouagon\r\n_[Conewango],_ this 29th July, as a token of renewal of possession\r\nheretofore taken of the aforesaid River Ohio, of all streams that fall\r\ninto it, and all lands on both sides to the source of the aforesaid\r\nstreams, as the preceding Kings of France have enjoyed or ought to have\r\nenjoyed it, and which they have upheld by force of arms and by treaties,\r\nnotably by those of Ryswick, Utrecht, and Aix-la-Chapelle.\"\r\n\r\nThis done, the party proceeded on its way, moving downward with the\r\ncurrent, and passing from time to time rough openings in the forest,\r\nwith clusters of Indian wigwams, the inmates of which showed a strong\r\ninclination to run off at their approach. To prevent this, Chabert de\r\nJoncaire was sent in advance, as a messenger of peace. He was himself\r\nhalf Indian, being the son of a French officer and a Seneca squaw,\r\nspeaking fluently his maternal tongue, and, like his father, holding an\r\nimportant place in all dealings between the French and the tribes who\r\nspoke dialects of the Iroquois. On this occasion his success was not\r\ncomplete. It needed all his art to prevent the alarmed savages from\r\ntaking to the woods. Sometimes, however, Céloron succeeded in gaining\r\nan audience; and at a village of Senecas called La Paille Coupée he read\r\nthem a message from La Galissonière couched in terms sufficiently\r\nimperative: \"My children, since I was at war with the English, I have\r\nlearned that they have seduced you; and not content with corrupting your\r\nhearts, have taken advantage of my absence to invade lands which are not\r\ntheirs, but mine; and therefore I have resolved to send you Monsieur de\r\nCéloron to tell you my intentions, which are that I will not endure the\r\nEnglish on my land. Listen to me, children; mark well the word that I\r\nsend you; follow my advice, and the sky will always be calm and clear\r\nover your villages. I expect from you an answer worthy of true\r\nchildren.\" And he urged them to stop all trade with the intruders, and\r\nsend them back to whence they came. They promised compliance; \"and,\"\r\nsays the chaplain, Bonnecamp, \"we should all have been satisfied if we\r\nhad thought them sincere; but nobody doubted that fear had extorted\r\ntheir answer.\"\r\n\r\nFour leagues below French Creek, by a rock scratched with Indian\r\nhieroglyphics, they buried another leaden plate. Three days after, they\r\nreached the Delaware village of Attiqué, at the site of Kittanning,\r\nwhose twenty-two wigwams were all empty, the owners having fled. A\r\nlittle farther on, at an old abandoned village of Shawanoes, they found\r\nsix English traders, whom they warned to begone, and return no more at\r\ntheir peril. Being helpless to resist, the traders pretended obedience;\r\nand Céloron charged them with a letter to the Governor of Pennsylvania,\r\nin which he declared that he was \"greatly surprised\" to find Englishmen\r\ntrespassing on the domain of France. \"I know,\" concluded the letter,\r\n\"that our Commandant-General would be very sorry to be forced to use\r\nviolence; but his orders are precise, to leave no foreign traders within\r\nthe limits of his government.\"[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Céloron, _Journal_. Compare the letter as translated in\r\n_N.Y. Col. Docs_., VI. 532; also _Colonial Records of Pa_., V. 325.]\r\n\r\nOn the next day they reached a village of Iroquois under a female chief,\r\ncalled Queen Alequippa by the English, to whom she was devoted. Both\r\nQueen and subjects had fled; but among the deserted wigwams were six\r\nmore Englishmen, whom Céloron warned off like the others, and who, like\r\nthem, pretended to obey. At a neighboring town they found only two\r\nwithered ancients, male and female, whose united ages, in the judgment\r\nof the chaplain, were full two centuries. They passed the site of the\r\nfuture Pittsburg; and some seventeen miles below approached Chininguée,\r\ncalled Logstown by the English, one of the chief places on the river.[7]\r\nBoth English and French flags were flying over the town, and the\r\ninhabitants, lining the shore, greeted their visitors with a salute of\r\nmusketry,--not wholly welcome, as the guns were charged will ball.\r\nCéloron threatened to fire on them if they did not cease. The French\r\nclimbed the steep bank, and encamped on the plateau above, betwixt the\r\nforest and the village, which consisted of some fifty cabins and\r\nwigwams, grouped in picturesque squalor, and tenanted by a mixed\r\npopulation, chiefly of Delawares, Shawanoes, and Mingoes. Here, too,\r\nwere gathered many fugitives from the deserted towns above. Céloron\r\nfeared a night attack. The camp was encircled by a ring of sentries; the\r\nofficers walked the rounds till morning; a part of the men were kept\r\nunder arms, and the rest ordered to sleep in their clothes. Joncaire\r\ndiscovered through some women of his acquaintance that an attack was\r\nintended. Whatever the danger may have been, the precautions of the\r\nFrench averted it; and instead of a battle, there was a council. Céloron\r\ndelivered to the assembled chiefs a message from the Governor more\r\nconciliatory than the former, \"Through the love I bear you, my children,\r\nI send you Monsieur de Céloron to open your eyes to the designs of the\r\nEnglish against your lands. The establishments they mean to make, and of\r\nwhich you are certainly ignorant, tend to your complete ruin. They hide\r\nfrom you their plans, which are to settle here and drive you away, if I\r\nlet them. As a good father who tenderly loves his children, and though\r\nfar away from them bears them always in his heart, I must warn you of\r\nthe danger that threatens you. The English intend to rob you of your\r\ncountry; and that they may succeed, they begin by corrupting your minds.\r\nAs they mean to seize the Ohio, which belongs to me, I send to warn them\r\nto retire.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: There was another Chiningué, the Shenango of the English,\r\non the Alleghany.]\r\n\r\nThe reply of the chiefs, though sufficiently humble, was not all that\r\ncould be wished. They begged that the intruders might stay a little\r\nlonger, since the goods they brought were necessary to them. It was in\r\nfact, these goods, cheap, excellent, and abundant as they were, which\r\nformed the only true bond between the English and the Western tribes.\r\nLogstown was one of the chief resorts of the English traders; and at\r\nthis moment there were ten of them in the place. Céloron warned them\r\noff. \"They agreed,\" says the chaplain, \"to all that was demanded, well\r\nresolved, no doubt, to do the contrary as soon as our backs were\r\nturned.\"\r\n\r\nHaving distributed gifts among the Indians, the French proceeded on\r\ntheir way, and at or near the mouth of Wheeling Creek buried another\r\nplate of lead. They repeated the same ceremony at the mouth of the\r\nMuskingum. Here, half a century later, when this region belonged to the\r\nUnited States, a party of boys, bathing in the river, saw the plate\r\nprotruding from the bank where the freshets had laid it bare, knocked it\r\ndown with a long stick, melted half of it into bullets, and gave what\r\nremained to a neighbor from Marietta, who, hearing of this mysterious\r\nrelic, inscribed in an unknown tongue, came to rescue it from their\r\nhands.[8] It is now in the cabinet of the American Antiquarian\r\nSociety.[9] On the eighteenth of August, Céloron buried yet another\r\nplate, at the mouth of the Great Kenawha. This, too, in the course of a\r\ncentury, was unearthed by the floods, and was found in 1846 by a boy at\r\nplay, by the edge of the water.[10] The inscriptions on all these plates\r\nwere much alike, with variations of date and place.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: O.H. Marshall, in _Magazine of American History, March,_\r\n1878.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: For papers relating to it, see _Trans. Amer. Antiq. Soc_.,\r\nII.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: For a facsimile of the inscription on this plate, see\r\n_Olden Time,_ I. 288. Céloron calls the Kenawha, _Chinodahichetha_. The\r\ninscriptions as given in his Journal correspond with those on the plates\r\ndiscovered.]\r\n\r\nThe weather was by turns rainy and hot; and the men, tired and famished,\r\nwere fast falling ill. On the twenty-second they approached Scioto,\r\ncalled by the French St. Yotoc, or Sinioto, a large Shawanoe town at the\r\nmouth of the river which bears the same name. Greatly doubting what\r\nwelcome awaited them, they filled their powderhorns and prepared for the\r\nworst. Joncaire was sent forward to propitiate the inhabitants; but they\r\nshot bullets through the flag that he carried, and surrounded him,\r\nyelling and brandishing their knives. Some were for killing him at once;\r\nothers for burning him alive. The interposition of a friendly Iroquois\r\nsaved him; and at length they let him go. Céloron was very uneasy at the\r\nreception of his messenger. \"I knew,\" he writes, \"the weakness of my\r\nparty, two thirds of which were young men who had never left home\r\nbefore, and would all have run at the sight of ten Indians. Still, there\r\nwas nothing for me but to keep on; for I was short of provisions, my\r\ncanoes were badly damaged, and I had no pitch or bark to mend them. So I\r\nembarked again, ready for whatever might happen. I had good officers,\r\nand about fifty men who could be trusted.\"\r\n\r\nAs they neared the town, the Indians swarmed to the shore, and began the\r\nusual salute of musketry. \"They fired,\" says Céloron, \"full a thousand\r\nshots; for the English give them powder for nothing.\" He prudently\r\npitched his camp on the farther side of the river, posted guards, and\r\nkept close watch. Each party distrusted and feared the other. At length,\r\nafter much ado, many debates, and some threatening movements on the part\r\nof the alarmed and excited Indians, a council took place at the tent of\r\nthe French commander; the chiefs apologized for the rough treatment of\r\nJoncaire, and Céloron replied with a rebuke, which would doubtless have\r\nbeen less mild, had he felt himself stronger. He gave them also a\r\nmessage from the Governor, modified, apparently, to suit the\r\ncircumstances; for while warning them of the wiles of the English, it\r\ngave no hint that the King of France claimed mastery of their lands.\r\nTheir answer was vague and unsatisfactory. It was plain that they were\r\nbound to the enemy by interest, if not by sympathy. A party of English\r\ntraders were living in the place; and Céloron summoned them to withdraw,\r\non pain of what might ensue. \"My instructions,\" he says, \"enjoined me to\r\ndo this, and even to pillage the English; but I was not strong enough;\r\nand as these traders were established in the village and well supported\r\nby the Indians, the attempt would have failed, and put the French to\r\nshame.\" The assembled chiefs having been regaled with a cup of brandy\r\neach,--the only part of the proceeding which seemed to please\r\nthem,--Céloron reimbarked, and continued his voyage.\r\n\r\nOn the thirtieth they reached the Great Miami, called by the French,\r\nRivière à la Roche; and here Céloron buried the last of his leaden\r\nplates. They now bade farewell to the Ohio, or, in the words of the\r\nchaplain, to \"La Belle Rivière,--that river so little known to the\r\nFrench, and unfortunately too well known to the English.\" He speaks of\r\nthe multitude of Indian villages on its shores, and still more on its\r\nnorthern branches. \"Each, great or small, has one or more English\r\ntraders, and each of these has hired men to carry his furs. Behold,\r\nthen, the English well advanced upon our lands, and, what is worse,\r\nunder the protection of a crowd of savages whom they have drawn over to\r\nthem, and whose number increases daily.\"\r\n\r\nThe course of the party lay up the Miami; and they toiled thirteen days\r\nagainst the shallow current before they reached a village of the Miami\r\nIndians, lately built at the mouth of the rivulet now called Loramie\r\nCreek. Over it ruled a chief to whom the French had given the singular\r\nname of La Demoiselle, but whom the English, whose fast friend he was,\r\ncalled Old Britain. The English traders who lived here had prudently\r\nwithdrawn, leaving only two hired men in the place. The object of\r\nCèloron was to induce the Demoiselle and his band to leave this new\r\nabode and return to their old villages near the French fort on the\r\nMaumee, where they would be safe from English seduction. To this end, he\r\ncalled them to a council, gave them ample gifts, and made them an\r\nharangue in the name of the Governor. The Demoiselle took the gifts,\r\nthanked his French father for his good advice, and promised to follow it\r\nat a more convenient time.[11] In vain Céloron insisted that he and his\r\ntribesmen should remove at once. Neither blandishments nor threats would\r\nprevail, and the French commander felt that his negotiation had failed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Céloron, _Journal_. Compare _A Message from the\r\nTwightwees_ (Miamis) in _Colonial Records of Pa_., V. 437, where they\r\nsay that they refused the gifts.]\r\n\r\nHe was not deceived. Far from leaving his village, the Demoiselle, who\r\nwas Great Chief of the Miami Confederacy, gathered his followers to the\r\nspot, till, less than two years after the visit of Céloron, its\r\npopulation had increased eightfold. Pique Town, or Pickawillany, as the\r\nEnglish called it, became one of the greatest Indian towns of the West,\r\nthe centre of English trade and influence, and a capital object of\r\nFrench jealousy.\r\n\r\nCéloron burned his shattered canoes, and led his party across the long\r\nand difficult portage to the French post on the Maumee, where he found\r\nRaymond, the commander, and all his men, shivering with fever and ague.\r\nThey supplied him with wooden canoes for his voyage down the river; and,\r\nearly in October, he reached Lake Erie, where he was detained for a time\r\nby a drunken debauch of his Indians, who are called by the chaplain \"a\r\nspecies of men made to exercise the patience of those who have the\r\nmisfortune to travel with them.\" In a month more he was at Fort\r\nFrontenac; and as he descended thence to Montreal, he stopped at the\r\nOswegatchie, in obedience to the Governor, who had directed him to\r\nreport the progress made by the Sulpitian, Abbé Piquet, at his new\r\nmission. Piquet's new fort had been burned by Indians, prompted, as he\r\nthought, by the English of Oswego; but the priest, buoyant and\r\nundaunted, was still resolute for the glory of God and the confusion of\r\nthe heretics.\r\n\r\nAt length Céloron reached Montreal; and, closing his Journal, wrote\r\nthus: \"Father Bonnecamp, who is a Jesuit and a great mathematician,\r\nreckons that we have travelled twelve hundred leagues; I and my officers\r\nthink we have travelled more. All I can say is, that the nations of\r\nthese countries are very ill-disposed towards the French, and devoted\r\nentirely to the English.\"[12] If his expedition had done no more, it had\r\nat least revealed clearly the deplorable condition of French interests\r\nin the West.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _Journal de la Campagne que moy Céloron, Chevalier de\r\nl'Ordre Royal et Militaire de St. Louis, Capitaine Commandant un\r\ndétachement envoyé dans la Belle Rivière par les ordres de M. le Marquis\r\nde La Galissonière_, etc.\r\n\r\n_Relation d'un voyage dans la Belle Rivière sous les ordres de M. de\r\nCéloron, par le Père Bonnecamp, en_ 1749.]\r\n\r\nWhile Céloron was warning English traders from the Ohio, a plan was on\r\nfoot in Virginia for a new invasion of the French domain. An association\r\nwas formed to settle the Ohio country; and a grant of five hundred\r\nthousand acres was procured from the King, on condition that a hundred\r\nfamilies should be established upon it within seven years, a fort built,\r\nand a garrison maintained. The Ohio Company numbered among its members\r\nsome of the chief men of Virginia, including two brothers of Washington;\r\nand it had also a London partner, one Hanbury, a person of influence,\r\nwho acted as its agent in England. In the year after the expedition of\r\nCéloron, its governing committee sent the trader Christopher Gist to\r\nexplore the country and select land. It must be \"good level land,\" wrote\r\nthe Committee; \"we had rather go quite down to the Mississippi than take\r\nmean, broken land.\"[13] In November Gist reached Logstown, the Chiningué\r\nof Céleron, where he found what he calls a \"parcel of reprobate Indian\r\ntraders.\" Those whom he so stigmatizes were Pennsylvanians, chiefly\r\nScotch-Irish, between whom and the traders from Virginia there was great\r\njealousy. Gist was told that he \"should never go home safe.\" He declared\r\nhimself the bearer of a message from the King. This imposed respect, and\r\nhe was allowed to proceed. At the Wyandot village of Muskingum he found\r\nthe trader George Croghan, sent to the Indians by the Governor of\r\nPennsylvania, to renew the chain of friendship.[14] \"Croghan,\" he says,\r\n\"is a mere idol among his countrymen, the Irish traders;\" yet they met\r\namicably, and the Pennsylvanian had with him a companion, Andrew\r\nMontour, the interpreter, who proved of great service to Gist. As\r\nMontour was a conspicuous person in his time, and a type of his class,\r\nhe merits a passing notice. He was the reputed grandson of a French\r\ngovernor and an Indian squaw. His half-breed mother, Catharine Montour,\r\nwas a native of Canada, whence she was carried off by the Iroquois, and\r\nadopted by them. She lived in a village at the head of Seneca Lake, and\r\nstill held the belief, inculcated by the guides of her youth, that\r\nChrist was a Frenchman crucified by the English.[15] Her son Andrew is\r\nthus described by the Moravian Zinzendorf, who knew him: \"His face is\r\nlike that of a European, but marked with a broad Indian ring of\r\nbear's-grease and paint drawn completely round it. He wears a coat of\r\nfine cloth of cinnamon color, a black necktie with silver spangles, a\r\nred satin waistcoat, trousers over which hangs his shirt, shoes and\r\nstockings, a hat, and brass ornaments, something like the handle of a\r\nbasket, suspended from his ears.\"[16] He was an excellent interpreter,\r\nand held in high account by his Indian kinsmen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Instructions to Gist, in appendix to Pownall,\r\n_Topographical Description of North America_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _Mr. Croghan's Transactions with the Indians_, in _N.Y.\r\nCol. Docs.,_ VII. 267; _Croghan to Hamilton, 16 Dec_. 1750.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: This is stated by Count Zinzendorf, who visited her among\r\nthe Senecas. In a plan of the \"Route of the Western Army,\" made in 1779,\r\nand of which a tracing is before me, the village where she lived is\r\nstill called \"French Catharine's Town.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Journal of Zinzendorf, quoted in Schweinitz, _Life of\r\nDavid Zeisberger, 112, note_.]\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Muskingum, Gist, Croghan, and Montour went together to a\r\nvillage on White Woman's Creek,--so called from one Mary Harris, who\r\nlived here. She was born in New England, was made prisoner when a child\r\nforty years before, and had since dwelt among her captors, finding such\r\ncomfort as she might in an Indian husband and a family of young\r\nhalf-breeds. \"She still remembers,\" says Gist, \"that they used to be\r\nvery religious in New England, and wonders how white men can be so\r\nwicked as she has seen them in these woods.\" He and his companions now\r\njourneyed southwestward to the Shawanoe town at the mouth of the\r\nScioto, where they found a reception very different from that which had\r\nawaited Céloron. Thence they rode northwestward along the forest path\r\nthat led to Pickawillany, the Indian town on the upper waters of the\r\nGreat Miami. Gist was delighted with the country; and reported to his\r\nemployers that \"it is fine, rich, level land, well timbered with large\r\nwalnut, ash, sugar trees and cherry trees; well watered with a great\r\nnumber of little streams and rivulets; full of beautiful natural\r\nmeadows, with wild rye, blue-grass, and clover, and abounding with\r\nturkeys, deer, elks, and most sorts of game, particularly buffaloes,\r\nthirty or forty of which are frequently seen in one meadow.\" A little\r\nfarther west, on the plains of the Wabash and the Illinois, he would\r\nhave found them by thousands.\r\n\r\nThey crossed the Miami on a raft, their horses swimming after them; and\r\nwere met on landing by a crowd of warriors, who, after smoking with\r\nthem, escorted them to the neighboring town, where they were greeted by\r\na fusillade of welcome. \"We entered with English colors before us, and\r\nwere kindly received by their king, who invited us into his own house\r\nand set our colors upon the top of it; then all the white men and\r\ntraders that were there came and welcomed us.\" This \"king\" was Old\r\nBritain, or La Demoiselle. Great were the changes here since Céleron, a\r\nyear and a half before, had vainly enticed him to change his abode, and\r\ndwell in the shadow of the fleur-de-lis. The town had grown to four\r\nhundred families, or about two thousand souls; and the English traders\r\nhad built for themselves and their hosts a fort of pickets, strengthened\r\nwith logs.\r\n\r\nThere was a series of councils in the long house, or town-hall. Croghan\r\nmade the Indians a present from the Governor of Pennsylvania; and he and\r\nGist delivered speeches of friendship and good advice, which the\r\nauditors received with the usual monosyllabic plaudits, ejected from the\r\ndepths of their throats. A treaty of peace was solemnly made between the\r\nEnglish and the confederate tribes, and all was serenity and joy; till\r\nfour Ottawas, probably from Detroit, arrived with a French flag, a gift\r\nof brandy and tobacco, and a message from the French commandant inviting\r\nthe Miamis to visit him. Whereupon the great war-chief rose, and, with\r\n\"a fierce tone and very warlike air,\" said to the envoys: \"Brothers the\r\nOttawas, we let you know, by these four strings of wampum, that we will\r\nnot hear anything the French say, nor do anything they bid us.\" Then\r\naddressing the French as if actually present: \"Fathers, we have made a\r\nroad to the sun-rising, and have been taken by the hand by our brothers\r\nthe English, the Six Nations, the Delawares, Shawanoes, and\r\nWyandots.[17] We assure you, in that road we will go; and as you\r\nthreaten us with war in the spring, we tell you that we are ready to\r\nreceive you.\" Then, turning again to the four envoys: \"Brothers the\r\nOttawas, you hear what I say. Tell that to your fathers the French, for\r\nwe speak it from our hearts.\" The chiefs then took down the French flag\r\nwhich the Ottawas had planted in the town, and dismissed the envoys with\r\ntheir answer of defiance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Compare _Message of Miamis and Hurons to the Governor of\r\nPennsylvania_ in _N.Y. Col. Docs_., VI. 594; and _Report of Croghan_ in\r\n_Colonial Records of Pa_., V. 522, 523.]\r\n\r\nOn the next day the town-crier came with a message from the Demoiselle,\r\ninviting his English guests to a \"feather dance,\" which Gist thus\r\ndescribes: \"It was performed by three dancing-masters, who were painted\r\nall over of various colors, with long sticks in their hands, upon the\r\nends of which were fastened long feathers of swans and other birds,\r\nneatly woven in the shape of a fowl's wing; in this disguise they\r\nperformed many antic tricks, waving their sticks and feathers about with\r\ngreat skill, to imitate the flying and fluttering of birds, keeping\r\nexact time with their music.\" This music was the measured thumping of an\r\nIndian drum. From time to time, a warrior would leap up, and the drum\r\nand the dancers would cease as he struck a post with his tomahawk, and\r\nin a loud voice recounted his exploits. Then the music and the dance\r\nbegan anew, till another warrior caught the martial fire, and bounded\r\ninto the circle to brandish his tomahawk and vaunt his prowess.\r\n\r\nOn the first of March Gist took leave of Pickawillany, and returned\r\ntowards the Ohio. He would have gone to the Falls, where Louisville now\r\nstands, but for a band of French Indians reported to be there, who would\r\nprobably have killed him. After visiting a deposit of mammoth bones on\r\nthe south shore, long the wonder of the traders, he turned eastward,\r\ncrossed with toil and difficulty the mountains about the sources of the\r\nKenawha, and after an absence of seven months reached his frontier home\r\non the Yadkin, whence he proceeded to Roanoke with the report of his\r\njourney.[18]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: _Journal of Christopher Gist_, in appendix to Pownall,\r\n_Topographical Description. Mr. Croghan's Transactions with the Indians_\r\nin _N.Y. Col. Docs_., VII. 267.]\r\n\r\nAll looked well for the English in the West; but under this fair outside\r\nlurked hidden danger. The Miamis were hearty in the English cause, and\r\nso perhaps were the Shawanoes; but the Delawares had not forgotten the\r\nwrongs that drove them from their old abodes east of the Alleghanies,\r\nwhile the Mingoes, or emigrant Iroquois, like their brethren of New\r\nYork, felt the influence of Joncaire and other French agents, who spared\r\nno efforts to seduce them.[19] Still more baneful to British interests\r\nwere the apathy and dissensions of the British colonies themselves. The\r\nOhio Company had built a trading-house at Will's Creek, a branch of the\r\nPotomac, to which the Indians resorted in great numbers; whereupon the\r\njealous traders of Pennsylvania told them that the Virginians meant to\r\nsteal away their lands. This confirmed what they had been taught by the\r\nFrench emissaries, whose intrigues it powerfully aided. The governors of\r\nNew York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia saw the importance of Indian\r\nalliances, and felt their own responsibility in regard to them; but they\r\ncould do nothing without their assemblies. Those of New York and\r\nPennsylvania were largely composed of tradesmen and farmers, absorbed in\r\nlocal interests, and possessed by two motives,--the saving of the\r\npeople's money, and opposition to the governor, who stood for the royal\r\nprerogative. It was Hamilton, of Pennsylvania, who had sent Croghan to\r\nthe Miamis to \"renew the chain of friendship;\" and when the envoy\r\nreturned, the Assembly rejected his report. \"I was condemned,\" he says,\r\n\"for bringing expense on the Government, and the Indians were\r\nneglected.\"[20]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Joncaire made anti-English speeches to the Ohio Indians\r\nunder the eyes of the English themselves, who did not molest him.\r\n_Journal of George Croghan_, 1751, in _Olden Time, I_. 136.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: _Mr. Croghan's Transactions with the Indians, N.Y. Col.\r\nDocs.,_ VII. 267.]\r\n\r\nIn the same year Hamilton again sent him over the mountains, with a\r\npresent for the Mingoes and Delawares. Croghan succeeded in persuading\r\nthem that it would be for their good if the English should build a\r\nfortified trading-house at the fork of the Ohio, where Pittsburg now\r\nstands; and they made a formal request to the Governor that it should be\r\nbuilt accordingly. But, in the words of Croghan, the Assembly \"rejected\r\nthe proposal, and condemned me for making such a report.\" Yet this post\r\non the Ohio was vital to English interests. Even the Penns,\r\nproprietaries of the province, never lavish of their money, offered four\r\nhundred pounds towards the cost of it, besides a hundred a year towards\r\nits maintenance; but the Assembly would not listen.[21] The Indians were\r\nso well convinced that a strong English trading-station in their country\r\nwould add to their safety and comfort, that when Pennsylvania refused\r\nit, they repeated the proposal to Virginia; but here, too, it found for\r\nthe present little favor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: _Colonial Records of Pa_., V. 515, 529, 547. At a council\r\nat Logstown (1751), the Indians said to Croghan: \"The French want to\r\ncheat us out of our country; but we will stop them, and, Brothers the\r\nEnglish, you must help us. We expect that you will build a strong house\r\non the River Ohio, that in case of war we may have a place to secure our\r\nwives and children, likewise our brothers that come to trade with us.\"\r\n_Report of Treaty at Logstown, Ibid_., V. 538.]\r\n\r\nThe question of disputed boundaries had much to do with this most\r\nimpolitic inaction. A large part of the valley of the Ohio, including\r\nthe site of the proposed establishment, was claimed by both Pennsylvania\r\nand Virginia; and each feared that whatever money it might spend there\r\nwould turn to the profit of the other. This was not the only evil that\r\nsprang from uncertain ownership. \"Till the line is run between the two\r\nprovinces,\" says Dinwiddie, governor of Virginia, \"I cannot appoint\r\nmagistrates to keep the traders in good order.\"[22] Hence they did what\r\nthey pleased, and often gave umbrage to the Indians. Clinton, of New\r\nYork, appealed to his Assembly for means to assist Pennsylvania in\r\n\"securing the fidelity of the Indians on the Ohio,\" and the Assembly\r\nrefused.[23] \"We will take care of our Indians, and they may take care\r\nof theirs:\" such was the spirit of their answer. He wrote to the various\r\nprovinces, inviting them to send commissioners to meet the tribes at\r\nAlbany, \"in order to defeat the designs and intrigues of the French.\"\r\nAll turned a deaf ear except Massachusetts, Connecticut, and South\r\nCarolina, who sent the commissioners, but supplied them very meagrely\r\nwith the indispensable presents.[24] Clinton says further: \"The Assembly\r\nof this province have not given one farthing for Indian affairs, nor for\r\na year past have they provided for the subsistence of the garrison at\r\nOswego, which is the key for the commerce between the colonies and the\r\ninland nations of Indians.\"[25]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: _Dinwiddie to the Lords of Trade, 6 Oct_. 1752.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: _Journals of New York Assembly_, II. 283, 284. _Colonial\r\nRecords of Pa_., V. 466.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: _Clinton to Hamilton, 18 Dec. 1750. Clinton to Lords of\r\nTrade, 13 June, 1751; Ibid., 17 July_, 1751.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: _Clinton to Bedford, 30 July_, 1750.]\r\n\r\nIn the heterogeneous structure of the British colonies, their clashing\r\ninterests, their internal disputes, and the misplaced economy of\r\npenny-wise and short-sighted assembly-men, lay the hope of France. The\r\nrulers of Canada knew the vast numerical preponderance of their rivals;\r\nbut with their centralized organization they felt themselves more than a\r\nmatch for any one English colony alone. They hoped to wage war under the\r\nguise of peace, and to deal with the enemy in detail; and they at length\r\nperceived that the fork of the Ohio, so strangely neglected by the\r\nEnglish, formed, together with Niagara, the key of the Great West. Could\r\nFrance hold firmly these two controlling passes, she might almost boast\r\nherself mistress of the continent.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The Journal of Céloron (Archives de la Marine) is very long and\r\ncircumstantial, including the _procès verbaux_, and reports of councils\r\nwith Indians. The Journal of the chaplain, Bonnecamp (Dépôt de la\r\nMarine), is shorter, but is the work of an intelligent and observing\r\nman. The author, a Jesuit, was skilled in mathematics, made daily\r\nobservations, and constructed a map of the route, still preserved at the\r\nDépôt de la Marine. Concurrently with these French narratives, one may\r\nconsult the English letters and documents bearing on the same subjects,\r\nin the Colonial Records of Pennsylvania, the Archives of Pennsylvania,\r\nand the Colonial Documents of New York.\r\n\r\nThree of Céleron's leaden plates have been found,--the two mentioned in\r\nthe text, and another which was never buried, and which the Indians, who\r\nregarded these mysterious tablets as \"bad medicine,\" procured by a trick\r\nfrom Joncaire, or, according to Governor Clinton, stole from him. A\r\nCayuga chief brought it to Colonel Johnson, on the Mohawk, who\r\ninterpreted the \"Devilish writing\" in such a manner as best to inspire\r\nhorror of French designs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\n1749-1753\r\n\r\nConflict for the West\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Iroquois, or Five Nations, sometimes called Six Nations after the\r\nTuscaroras joined them, had been a power of high importance in American\r\ninternational politics. In a certain sense they may be said to have held\r\nthe balance between their French and English neighbors; but their\r\nrelative influence had of late declined. So many of them had emigrated\r\nand joined the tribes of the Ohio, that the centre of Indian population\r\nhad passed to that region. Nevertheless, the Five Nations were still\r\nstrong enough in their ancient abodes to make their alliance an object\r\nof the utmost consequence to both the European rivals. At the western\r\nend of their \"Long House,\" or belt of confederated villages, Joncaire\r\nintrigued to gain them for France; while in the east he was counteracted\r\nby the young colonel of militia, William Johnson, who lived on the\r\nMohawk, and was already well skilled in managing Indians. Johnson\r\nsometimes lost his temper; and once wrote to Governor Clinton to\r\ncomplain of the \"confounded wicked things the French had infused into\r\nthe Indians' heads; among the rest that the English were determined, the\r\nfirst opportunity, to destroy them all. I assure your Excellency I had\r\nhard work to beat these and several other cursed villanous things, told\r\nthem by the French, out of their heads.\"[26]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: _Johnson to Clinton, 28 April_, 1749.]\r\n\r\nIn former times the French had hoped to win over the Five Nations in a\r\nbody, by wholesale conversion to the Faith; but the attempt had failed.\r\nThey had, however, made within their own limits an asylum for such\r\nconverts as they could gain, whom they collected together at\r\nCaughnawaga, near Montreal, to the number of about three hundred\r\nwarriors.[27] These could not be trusted to fight their kinsmen, but\r\nwillingly made forays against the English borders. Caughnawaga, like\r\nvarious other Canadian missions, was divided between the Church, the\r\narmy, and the fur-trade. It had a chapel, fortifications, and\r\nstorehouses; two Jesuits, an officer, and three chief traders. Of these\r\nlast, two were maiden ladies, the Demoiselles Desauniers; and one of the\r\nJesuits, their friend Father Tournois, was their partner in business.\r\nThey carried on by means of the Mission Indians, and in collusion with\r\ninfluential persons in the colony, a trade with the Dutch at Albany,\r\nillegal, but very profitable.[28]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: The estimate of a French official report, 1736, and of Sir\r\nWilliam Johnson, 1763.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: _La Jonquière au Ministre, 27 Fév. 1750. Ibid., 29 Oct.\r\n1751. Ordres du Roy et Dépêches des Ministres, 1751. Notice biographique\r\nde la Jonquière_. La Jonquifère, governor of Canada, at last broke up\r\ntheir contraband trade, and ordered Tournois to Quebec.]\r\n\r\nBesides this Iroquois mission, which was chiefly composed of Mohawks and\r\nOneidas, another was now begun farther westward, to win over the\r\nOnondagas, Cayugas, and Senecas. This was the establishment of Father\r\nPiquet, which Céloron had visited in its infancy when on his way to the\r\nOhio, and again on his return. Piquet was a man in the prime of life, of\r\nan alert, vivacious countenance, by no means unprepossessing;[29] an\r\nenthusiastic schemer, with great executive talents; ardent, energetic,\r\nvain, self-confident, and boastful. The enterprise seems to have been of\r\nhis own devising; but it found warm approval from the Government.[30] La\r\nPrésentation, as he called the new mission, stood on the bank of the\r\nRiver Oswegatchie where it enters the St. Lawrence. Here the rapids\r\nceased, and navigation was free to Lake Ontario. The place commanded the\r\nmain river, and could bar the way to hostile war-parties or contraband\r\ntraders. Rich meadows, forests, and abundance of fish and game, made it\r\nattractive to Indians, and the Oswegatchie gave access to the Iroquois\r\ntowns. Piquet had chosen his site with great skill. His activity was\r\nadmirable. His first stockade was burned by Indian incendiaries; but it\r\nrose quickly from its ashes, and within a year or two the mission of La\r\nPrésentation had a fort of palisades flanked with blockhouses, a chapel,\r\na storehouse, a barn, a stable, ovens, a saw-mill, broad fields of corn\r\nand beans, and three villages of Iroquois, containing, in all,\r\nforty-nine bark lodges, each holding three or four families, more or\r\nless converted to the Faith; and, as time went on, this number\r\nincreased. The Governor had sent a squad of soldiers to man the fort,\r\nand five small cannon to mount upon it. The place was as safe for the\r\nnew proselytes as it was convenient and agreeable. The Pennsylvanian\r\ninterpreter, Conrad Weiser, was told at Onondaga, the Iroquois capital,\r\nthat Piquet had made a hundred converts from that place alone; and that,\r\n\"having clothed them all in very fine clothes, laced with silver and\r\ngold, he took them down and presented them to the French Governor at\r\nMontreal, who received them very kindly, and made them large\r\npresents.\"[31]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: I once saw a contemporary portrait of him at the mission\r\nof Two Mountains, where he had been stationed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: _Rouillé à la Jonquière_, 1749. The Intendant Bigot gave\r\nhim money and provisions. _N.Y. Col. Docs., X_. 204.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: _Journal of Conrad Weiser,_ 1750.]\r\n\r\nSuch were some of the temporal attractions of La Présentation. The\r\nnature of the spiritual instruction bestowed by Piquet and his\r\nfellow-priests may be partly inferred from the words of a proselyte\r\nwarrior, who declared with enthusiasm that he had learned from the\r\nSulpitian missionary that the King of France was the eldest son of the\r\nwife of Jesus Christ.[32] This he of course took in a literal sense, the\r\nmystic idea of the Church as the spouse of Christ being beyond his\r\nsavage comprehension. The effect was to stimulate his devotion to the\r\nGreat Onontio beyond the sea, and to the lesser Onontio who represented\r\nhim as Governor of Canada.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Lalande, _Notice de L'Abbé Piquet, in Lettres Édifiantes_.\r\nSee also Tassé in _Revue Canadienne,_ 1870, p. 9.]\r\n\r\nPiquet was elated by his success; and early in 1752 he wrote to the\r\nGovernor and Intendant: \"It is a great miracle that, in spite of envy,\r\ncontradiction, and opposition from nearly all the Indian villages, I\r\nhave formed in less than three years one of the most flourishing\r\nmissions in Canada. I find myself in a position to extend the empire of\r\nmy good masters, Jesus Christ and the King, even to the extremities of\r\nthis new world; and, with some little help from you, to do more than\r\nFrance and England have been able to do with millions of money and all\r\ntheir troops.\"[33]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: _Piquet à la Jonquière et Bigot, 8 Fév._ 1752. See\r\nAppendix A. In spite of Piquet's self-laudation, and in spite also of\r\nthe detraction of the author of the _Mémoires sur le Canada,_ 1749-1760,\r\nthere can be no doubt of his practical capacity and his fertility of\r\nresource. Duquesne, when governor of the colony, highly praises \"ses\r\ntalents et son activité pour le service de Sa Majesté.\"]\r\n\r\nThe letter from which this is taken was written to urge upon the\r\nGovernment a scheme in which the zealous priest could see nothing\r\nimpracticable. He proposed to raise a war-party of thirty-eight hundred\r\nIndians, eighteen hundred of whom were to be drawn from the Canadian\r\nmissions, the Five Nations, and the tribes of the Ohio, while the\r\nremaining two thousand were to be furnished by the Flatheads, or\r\nChoctaws, who were at the same time to be supplied with missionaries.\r\nThe united force was first to drive the English from the Ohio, and next\r\nattack the Dog Tribe, or Cherokees, who lived near the borders of\r\nVirginia, with the people of which they were on friendly terms. \"If,\"\r\nsays Piquet, \"the English of Virginia give any help to this last-named\r\ntribe,--which will not fail to happen,--they [_the war-party_] will do\r\ntheir utmost against them, through a grudge they bear them by reason of\r\nsome old quarrels.\" In other words, the missionary hopes to set a host\r\nof savages to butchering English settlers in time of peace![34] His\r\nwild project never took effect, though the Governor, he says, at first\r\napproved it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Appendix A.]\r\n\r\nIn the preceding year the \"Apostle of the Iroquois,\" as he was called,\r\nmade a journey to muster recruits for his mission, and kept a copious\r\ndiary on the way. By accompanying him, one gets a clear view of an\r\nimportant part of the region in dispute between the rival nations. Six\r\nCanadians paddled him up the St. Lawrence, and five Indian converts\r\nfollowed in another canoe. Emerging from among the Thousand Islands,\r\nthey stopped at Fort Frontenac, where Kingston now stands. Once the\r\nplace was a great resort of Indians; now none were here, for the English\r\npost of Oswego, on the other side of the lake, had greater attractions.\r\nPiquet and his company found the pork and bacon very bad, and he\r\ncomplains that \"there was not brandy enough in the fort to wash a\r\nwound.\" They crossed to a neighboring island, where they were soon\r\nvisited by the chaplain of the fort, the storekeeper, his wife, and\r\nthree young ladies, glad of an excursion to relieve the monotony of the\r\ngarrison. \"My hunters,\" says Piquet, \"had supplied me with means of\r\ngiving them a pretty good entertainment. We drank, with all our hearts,\r\nthe health of the authorities, temporal and ecclesiastical, to the sound\r\nof our musketry, which was very well fired, and delighted the\r\nislanders.\" These islanders were a band of Indians who lived here.\r\nPiquet gave them a feast, then discoursed of religion, and at last\r\npersuaded them to remove to the new mission.\r\n\r\nDuring eight days he and his party coasted the northern shore of Lake\r\nOntario, with various incidents, such as an encounter between his dog\r\nCerberus and a wolf, to the disadvantage of the latter, and the meeting\r\nwith \"a very fine negro of twenty-two years, a fugitive from Virginia.\"\r\nOn the twenty-sixth of June they reached the new fort of Toronto, which\r\noffered a striking contrast to their last stopping-place. \"The wine here\r\nis of the best; there is nothing wanting in this fort; everything is\r\nabundant, fine, and good.\" There was reason for this. The Northern\r\nIndians were flocking with their beaver-skins to the English of Oswego;\r\nand in April, 1749, an officer named Portneuf had been sent with\r\nsoldiers and workmen to build a stockaded trading-house at Toronto, in\r\norder to intercept them,--not by force, which would have been ruinous\r\nto French interests, but by a tempting supply of goods and brandy.[35]\r\nThus the fort was kept well stocked, and with excellent effect. Piquet\r\nfound here a band of Mississagas, who would otherwise, no doubt, have\r\ncarried their furs to the English. He was strongly impelled to persuade\r\nthem to migrate to La Présentation; but the Governor had told him to\r\nconfine his efforts to other tribes; and lest, he says, the ardor of his\r\nzeal should betray him to disobedience, he reimbarked, and encamped six\r\nleagues from temptation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: On Toronto, _La Jonquière et Bigot au Ministre, 1749. La\r\nJonquière au Ministre, 30 Août, 1750. N.Y. Col. Docs. X_. 201, 246.]\r\n\r\nTwo days more brought him to Niagara, where he was warmly received by\r\nthe commandant, the chaplain, and the storekeeper,--the triumvirate who\r\nruled these forest outposts, and stood respectively for then: three\r\nvital principles, war, religion, and trade. Here Piquet said mass; and\r\nafter resting a day, set out for the trading-house at the portage of the\r\ncataract, recently built, like Toronto, to stop the Indians on their way\r\nto Oswego.[36] Here he found Joncaire, and here also was encamped a\r\nlarge band of Senecas; though, being all drunk, men, women, and\r\nchildren, they were in no condition to receive the Faith, or appreciate\r\nthe temporal advantages that attended it. On the next morning, finding\r\nthem partially sober, he invited them to remove to La Présentation; \"but\r\nas they had still something left in their bottles, I could get no answer\r\ntill the following day.\" \"I pass in silence,\" pursues the missionary,\r\n\"an infinity of talks on this occasion. Monsieur de Joncaire forgot\r\nnothing that could help me, and behaved like a great servant of God and\r\nthe King. My recruits increased every moment. I went to say my breviary\r\nwhile my Indians and the Senecas, without loss of time, assembled to\r\nhold a council with Monsieur de Joncaire.\" The result of the council was\r\nan entreaty to the missionary not to stop at Oswego, lest evil should\r\nbefall him at the hands of the English. He promised to do as they\r\nwished, and presently set out on his return to Fort Niagara, attended by\r\nJoncaire and a troop of his new followers. The journey was a triumphal\r\nprogress. \"Whenever was passed a camp or a wigwam, the Indians saluted\r\nme by firing their guns, which happened so often that I thought all the\r\ntrees along the way were charged with gunpowder; and when we reached the\r\nfort, Monsieur de Becancour received us with great ceremony and the\r\nfiring of cannon, by which my savages were infinitely flattered.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: _La Jonquière au Ministre, 23 Fév. 1750. Ibid., 6 Oct_.\r\n1751. Compare _Colonial Records of Pa_., V. 508.]\r\n\r\nHis neophytes were gathered into the chapel for the first time in their\r\nlives, and there rewarded with a few presents. He now prepared to turn\r\nhomeward, his flock at the mission being left in his absence without a\r\nshepherd; and on the sixth of July he embarked, followed by a swarm of\r\ncanoes. On the twelfth they stopped at the Genesee, and went to visit\r\nthe Falls, where the city of Rochester now stands. On the way, the\r\nIndians found a populous resort of rattlesnakes, and attacked the\r\ngregarious reptiles with great animation, to the alarm of the\r\nmissionary, who trembled for his bare-legged retainers. His fears proved\r\nneedless. Forty-two dead snakes, as he avers, requited the efforts of\r\nthe sportsmen, and not one of them was bitten. When he returned to camp\r\nin the afternoon he found there a canoe loaded with kegs of brandy. \"The\r\nEnglish,\" he says, \"had sent it to meet us, well knowing that this was\r\nthe best way to cause disorder among my new recruits and make them\r\ndesert me. The Indian in charge of the canoe, who had the look of a\r\ngreat rascal, offered some to me first, and then to my Canadians and\r\nIndians. I gave out that it was very probably poisoned, and immediately\r\nembarked again.\"\r\n\r\nHe encamped on the fourteenth at Sodus Bay, and strongly advises the\r\nplanting of a French fort there. \"Nevertheless,\" he adds, \"it would be\r\nstill better to destroy Oswego, and on no account let the English build\r\nit again.\" On the sixteenth he came in sight of this dreaded post.\r\nSeveral times on the way he had met fleets of canoes going thither\r\nor returning, in spite of the rival attractions of Toronto and Niagara.\r\nNo English establishment on the continent was of such ill omen to the\r\nFrench. It not only robbed them of the fur-trade, by which they lived,\r\nbut threatened them with military and political, no less than commercial,\r\nruin. They were in constant dread lest ships of war should be built\r\nhere, strong enough to command Lake Ontario, thus separating Canada from\r\nLouisiana, and cutting New France asunder. To meet this danger, they\r\nsoon after built at Fort Frontenac a large three-masted vessel, mounted\r\nwith heavy cannon; thus, as usual, forestalling their rivals by\r\npromptness of action.[37] The ground on which Oswego stood was claimed\r\nby the Province of New York, which alone had control of it; but through\r\nthe purblind apathy of the Assembly, and their incessant quarrels with\r\nthe Governor, it was commonly left to take care of itself. For some\r\ntime they would vote no money to pay the feeble little garrison; and\r\nClinton, who saw the necessity of maintaining it, was forced to do so on\r\nhis own personal credit.[38] \"Why can't your Governor and your great men\r\n[_the Assembly_] agree?\" asked a Mohawk chief of the interpreter, Conrad\r\nWeiser.[39]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: _Lieutenant Lindesay to Johnson, July, 1751._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: _Clinton to Lords of Trade, 30 July, 1750._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: _Journal of Conrad Weiser, 1750._]\r\n\r\nPiquet kept his promise not to land at the English fort; but he\r\napproached in his canoe, and closely observed it. The shores, now\r\ncovered by the city of Oswego, were then a desolation of bare hills and\r\nfields, studded with the stumps of felled trees, and hedged about with a\r\ngrim border of forests. Near the strand, by the mouth of the Onondaga,\r\nwere the houses of some of the traders; and on the higher ground behind\r\nthem stood a huge blockhouse with a projecting upper story. This\r\nbuilding was surrounded by a rough wall of stone, with flankers at the\r\nangles, forming what was called the fort.[40] Piquet reconnoitred it\r\nfrom his canoe with the eye of a soldier. \"It is commanded,\" he says,\r\n\"on almost every side; two batteries, of three twelve-pounders each,\r\nwould be more than enough to reduce it to ashes.\" And he enlarges on the\r\nevils that arise from it. \"It not only spoils our trade, but puts the\r\nEnglish into communication with a vast number of our Indians, far and\r\nnear. It is true that they like our brandy better than English rum; but\r\nthey prefer English goods to ours, and can buy for two beaver-skins at\r\nOswego a better silver bracelet than we sell at Niagara for ten.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Compare _Doc. Hist. N.Y._, I. 463.]\r\n\r\nThe burden of these reflections was lightened when he approached Fort\r\nFrontenac. \"Never was reception more solemn. The Nipissings and\r\nAlgonkins, who were going on a war-party with Monsieur Belêtre, formed a\r\nline of their own accord, and saluted us with three volleys of musketry,\r\nand cries of joy without end. All our little bark vessels replied in the\r\nsame way. Monsieur de Verchères and Monsieur de Valtry ordered the\r\ncannon of the fort to be fired; and my Indians, transported with joy at\r\nthe honor done them, shot off their guns incessantly, with cries and\r\nacclamations that delighted everybody.\" A goodly band of recruits joined\r\nhim, and he pursued his voyage to La Présentation, while the canoes of\r\nhis proselytes followed in a swarm to their new home; \"that\r\nestablishment\"--thus in a burst of enthusiasm he closes his\r\nJournal--\"that establishment which I began two years ago, in the midst\r\nof opposition; that establishment which may be regarded as a key of the\r\ncolony; that establishment which officers, interpreters, and traders\r\nthought a chamaera,--that establishment, I say, forms already a mission\r\nof Iroquois savages whom I assembled at first to the number of only six,\r\nincreased last year to eighty-seven, and this year to three hundred and\r\nninety-six, without counting more than a hundred and fifty whom Monsieur\r\nChabert de Joncaire is to bring me this autumn. And I certify that thus\r\nfar I have received from His Majesty--for all favor, grace, and\r\nassistance--no more than a half pound of bacon and two pounds of bread\r\nfor daily rations; and that he has not yet given a pin to the chapel,\r\nwhich I have maintained out of my own pocket, for the greater glory of\r\nmy masters, God and the King.\"[41]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: _Journal qui peut servir de Mémoire et de Relation du\r\nVoyage que j'ay fait sur le Lac Ontario pour attirer au nouvel\r\nÉtablissement de La Présentation les Sauvages Iroquois des Cinq Nations,\r\n1751_. The last passage given above is condensed in the rendering, as\r\nthe original is extremely involved and ungrammatical.]\r\n\r\nIn his late journey he had made the entire circuit of Lake Ontario.\r\nBeyond lay four other inland oceans, to which Fort Niagara was the key.\r\nAs that all-essential post controlled the passage from Ontario to Erie,\r\nso did Fort Detroit control that from Erie to Huron, and Fort\r\nMichillimackinac that from Huron to Michigan; while Fort Ste. Marie, at\r\nthe outlet of Lake Superior, had lately received a garrison, and changed\r\nfrom a mission and trading-station to a post of war.[42] This immense\r\nextent of inland navigation was safe in the hands of France so long as\r\nshe held Niagara. Niagara lost, not only the lakes, but also the Valley\r\nof the Ohio was lost with it. Next in importance was Detroit. This was\r\nnot a military post alone, but also a settlement; and, except the\r\nhamlets about Fort Chartres, the only settlement that France owned in\r\nall the West. There were, it is true, but a few families; yet the hope\r\nof growth seemed good; for to such as liked a wilderness home, no spot\r\nin America had more attraction. Father Bonnecamp stopped here for a day\r\non his way back from the expedition of Céloron. \"The situation,\" he\r\nsays, \"is charming. A fine river flows at the foot of the\r\nfortifications; vast meadows, asking only to be tilled, extend beyond\r\nthe sight. Nothing can be more agreeable than the climate. Winter lasts\r\nhardly two months. European grains and fruits grow here far better than\r\nin many parts of France. It is the Touraine and Beauce of Canada.\"[43]\r\nThe white flag of the Bourbons floated over the compact little\r\npalisaded town, with its population of soldiers and fur-traders; and\r\nfrom the blockhouses which served as bastions, one saw on either hand\r\nthe small solid dwellings of the _habitants_, ranged at intervals along\r\nthe margin of the water; while at a little distance three Indian\r\nvillages--Ottawa, Pottawattamie, and Wyandot--curled their wigwam smoke\r\ninto the pure summer air.[44]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: _La Jonquière au Ministre, 24 Août, 1750_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: _Relation du Voiage de la Belle Rivière, 1749_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: A plan of Detroit is before me, made about this time by\r\nthe engineer Lery.]\r\n\r\nWhen Céloron de Bienville returned from the Ohio, he went, with a royal\r\ncommission, sent him a year before, to command at Detroit.[45] His late\r\nchaplain, the very intelligent Father Bonnecamp, speaks of him as\r\nfearless, energetic, and full of resource; but the Governor calls him\r\nhaughty and insubordinate. Great efforts were made, at the same time, to\r\nbuild up Detroit as a centre of French power in the West. The methods\r\nemployed were of the debilitating, paternal character long familiar to\r\nCanada. All emigrants with families were to be carried thither at the\r\nKing's expense; and every settler was to receive in free gift a gun, a\r\nhoe, an axe, a ploughshare, a scythe, a sickle, two augers, large and\r\nsmall, a sow, six hens, a cock, six pounds of powder, and twelve pounds\r\nof lead; while to these favors were added many others. The result was\r\nthat twelve families were persuaded to go, or about a twentieth part of\r\nthe number wanted.[46] Detroit was expected to furnish supplies to the\r\nother posts for five hundred miles around, control the neighboring\r\nIndians, thwart English machinations, and drive off English interlopers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: _Le Ministre à la Jonquière et Bigot, 14 Mai, 1749. Le\r\nMinistre à Céloron, 23 Mai, 1749_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: _Ordonnance du 2 Jan. 1750. La Jonquière et Bigot au\r\nMinistre, 1750_. Forty-six persons of all ages and both sexes had been\r\ninduced by La Galissonière to go the year before. _Lettres communes de\r\nla Jonquière et Bigot, 1749_. The total fixed population of Detroit and\r\nits neighborhood in 1750 is stated at four hundred and eighty-three\r\nsouls. In the following two years, a considerable number of young men\r\ncame of their own accord, and Céloron wrote to Montreal to ask for girls\r\nto marry them.]\r\n\r\nLa Galissonière no longer governed Canada. He had been honorably\r\nrecalled, and the Marquis de la Jonquière sent in his stead.[47] La\r\nJonquière, like his predecessor, was a naval officer of high repute; he\r\nwas tall and imposing in person, and of undoubted capacity and courage;\r\nbut old and, according to his enemies, very avaricious.[48] The Colonial\r\nMinister gave him special instructions regarding that thorn in the side\r\nof Canada, Oswego. To attack it openly would be indiscreet, as the two\r\nnations were at peace; but there was a way of dealing with it less\r\nhazardous, if not more lawful. This was to attack it vicariously by\r\nmeans of the Iroquois. \"If Abbé Piquet succeeds in his mission,\" wrote\r\nthe Minister to the new Governor, \"we can easily persuade these savages\r\nto destroy Oswego. This is of the utmost importance; but act with great\r\ncaution.\"[49] In the next year the Minister wrote again: \"The only means\r\nthat can be used for such an operation in time of peace are those of the\r\nIroquois. If by making these savages regard such an establishment\r\n[_Oswego_] as opposed to their liberty, and, so to speak, a usurpation\r\nby which the English mean to get possession of their lands, they could\r\nbe induced to undertake its destruction, an operation of the sort is not\r\nto be neglected; but M. le Marquis de la Jonquière should feel with what\r\ncircumspection such an affair should be conducted, and he should labor\r\nto accomplish it in a manner not to commit himself.\"[50] To this La\r\nJonquière replies that it will need time; but that he will gradually\r\nbring the Iroquois to attack and destroy the English post. He received\r\nstringent orders to use every means to prevent the English from\r\nencroaching, but to act towards them at the same time \"with the greatest\r\npoliteness.\"[51] This last injunction was scarcely fulfilled in a\r\ncorrespondence which he had with Clinton, governor of New York, who had\r\nwritten to complain of the new post at the Niagara portage as an\r\ninvasion of English territory, and also of the arrest of four English\r\ntraders in the country of the Miamis. Niagara, like Oswego, was in the\r\ncountry of the Five Nations, whom the treaty of Utrecht declared\r\n\"subject to the dominion of Great Britain.\"[52] This declaration,\r\npreposterous in itself, was binding on France, whose plenipotentiaries\r\nhad signed the treaty. The treaty also provided that the subjects of the\r\ntwo Crowns \"shall enjoy full liberty of going and coming on account of\r\ntrade,\" and Clinton therefore demanded that La Jonquière should disavow\r\nthe arrest of the four traders and punish its authors. The French\r\nGovernor replied with great asperity, spurned the claim that the Five\r\nNations were British subjects, and justified the arrest.[53] He\r\npresently went further. Rewards were offered by his officers for the\r\nscalps of Croghan and of another trader named Lowry.[54] When this\r\nreached the ears of William Johnson, on the Mohawk, he wrote to Clinton\r\nin evident anxiety for his own scalp: \"If the French go on so, there is\r\nno man can be safe in his own house; for I can at any time get an Indian\r\nto kill any man for a small matter. Their going on in that manner is\r\nworse than open war.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: _Le Ministre à la Galissonière, 14 Mai, 1749_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: _Mémoires sur le Canada, 1749-1760_. The charges made here\r\nand elsewhere are denied, somewhat faintly, by a descendant of La\r\nJonquière in his elaborate _Notice biographique_ of his ancestor.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: _Le Ministre à La Jonquière, Mai, 1749_. The instructions\r\ngiven to La Jonquière before leaving France also urge the necessity of\r\ndestroying Oswego.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: _Ordres du Roy et Dépêches des Ministres; à MM. de la\r\nJonquière et Bigot, 15 Avril, 1750_. See Appendix A. for original.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: _Ordres du Roy et Dépêches des Ministres, 1750_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: Chalmers, _Collection of Treaties_, I. 382.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: _La Jonquière à Clinton, 10 Août, 1751_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: Deposition of Morris Turner and Ralph Kilgore, in\r\n_Colonial Records of Pa._, V. 482. The deponents had been prisoners at\r\nDetroit.]\r\n\r\nThe French on their side made counter-accusations. The captive traders\r\nwere examined on oath before La Jonquière, and one of them, John Patton,\r\nis reported to have said that Croghan had instigated Indians to kill\r\nFrenchmen.[55] French officials declared that other English traders were\r\nguilty of the same practices; and there is very little doubt that the\r\ncharge was true.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: _Précis des Faits, avec leurs Pièces justificatives_,\r\n100.]\r\n\r\nThe dispute with the English was not the only source of trouble to the\r\nGovernor. His superiors at Versailles would not adopt his views, and\r\nlooked on him with distrust. He advised the building of forts near Lake\r\nErie, and his advice was rejected. \"Niagara and Detroit,\" he was told,\r\n\"will secure forever our communications with Louisiana.\"[56] \"His\r\nMajesty,\" again wrote the Colonial Minister, \"thought that expenses\r\nwould diminish after the peace; but, on the contrary, they have\r\nincreased. There must be great abuses. You and the Intendant must look\r\nto it.\"[57] Great abuses there were; and of the money sent to Canada for\r\nthe service of the King the larger part found its way into the pockets\r\nof peculators. The colony was eaten to the heart with official\r\ncorruption; and the centre of it was François Bigot, the intendant. The\r\nMinister directed La Jonquière's attention to certain malpractices\r\nwhich had been reported to him; and the old man, deeply touched,\r\nreplied: \"I have reached the age of sixty-six years, and there is not a\r\ndrop of blood in my veins that does not thrill for the service of my\r\nKing. I will not conceal from you that the slightest suspicion on your\r\npart against me would cut the thread of my days.\"[58]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: _Ordres du Roy et Dépêches des Ministres_, 1750.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: _Ibid., 6 Juin_, 1751.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: _La Jonquière au Ministre, 19 Oct_. 1751.]\r\n\r\nPerplexities increased; affairs in the West grew worse and worse. La\r\nJonquière ordered Céloron to attack the English at Pickawillany; and\r\nCéloron could not or would not obey. \"I cannot express,\" writes the\r\nGovernor, \"how much this business troubles me; it robs me of sleep; it\r\nmakes me ill.\" Another letter of rebuke presently came from Versailles.\r\n\"Last year you wrote that you would soon drive the English from the\r\nOhio; but private letters say that you have done nothing. This is\r\ndeplorable. If not expelled, they will seem to acquire a right against\r\nus. Send force enough at once to drive them off, and cure them of all\r\nwish to return.\"[59] La Jonquière answered with bitter complaints\r\nagainst Céloron, and then begged to be recalled. His health, already\r\nshattered, was ruined by fatigue and vexation; and he took to his bed.\r\nBefore spring he was near his end.[60] It is said that, though very\r\nrich, his habits of thrift so possessed his last hours that, seeing\r\nwax-candles burning in his chamber, he ordered others of tallow to be\r\nbrought instead, as being good enough to die by. Thus frugally lighted\r\non its way, his spirit fled; and the Baron de Longueuil took his place\r\ntill a new governor should arrive.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: _Ordres du Roy et Dépêches des Ministres_, 1751.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: He died on the sixth of March, 1752 (_Bigot au Ministre, 6\r\nMai_); not on the seventeeth of May, as stated in the _Mémoires sur le\r\nCanada_, 1749-1760.]\r\n\r\nSinister tidings came thick from the West. Raymond, commandant at the\r\nFrench fort on the Maumee, close to the centre of intrigue, wrote: \"My\r\npeople are leaving me for Detroit. Nobody wants to stay here and have\r\nhis throat cut. All the tribes who go to the English at Pickawillany\r\ncome back loaded with gifts. I am too weak to meet the danger. Instead\r\nof twenty men, I need five hundred.... We have made peace with the\r\nEnglish, yet they try continually to make war on us by means of the\r\nIndians; they intend to be masters of all this upper country. The tribes\r\nhere are leaguing together to kill all the French, that they may have\r\nnobody on their lands but their English brothers. This I am told by\r\nColdfoot, a great Miami chief, whom I think an honest man, if there is\r\nany such thing among Indians.... If the English stay in this country we\r\nare lost. We must attack, and drive them out.\" And he tells of war-belts\r\nsent from tribe to tribe, and rumors of plots and conspiracies far and\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt, the English traders spared no pains to gain over the\r\nIndians by fair means or foul; sold them goods at low rates, made ample\r\ngifts, and gave gunpowder for the asking. Saint-Ange, who commanded at\r\nVincennes, wrote that a storm would soon burst on the heads of the\r\nFrench. Joncaire reported that all the Ohio Indians sided with the\r\nEnglish. Longueuil informed the Minister that the Miamis had scalped two\r\nsoldiers; that the Piankishaws had killed seven Frenchmen; and that a\r\nsquaw who had lived with one of the slain declared that the tribes of\r\nthe Wabash and Illinois were leaguing with the Osages for a combined\r\ninsurrection. Every letter brought news of murder. Small-pox had broken\r\nout at Detroit. \"It is to be wished,\" says Longueuil, \"that it would\r\nspread among our rebels; it would be fully as good as an army.... We are\r\nmenaced with a general outbreak, and even Toronto is in danger....\r\nBefore long the English on the Miami will gain over all the surrounding\r\ntribes, get possession of Fort Chartres, and cut our communications with\r\nLouisiana.\"[61]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: _Dépêches de Longueuil; Lettres de Raymond; Benoit de\r\nSaint-Clere à la Jonquière, Oct. 1751._]\r\n\r\nThe moving spirit of disaffection was the chief called Old Britain, or\r\nthe Demoiselle, and its focus was his town of Pickawillany, on the\r\nMiami. At this place it is said that English traders sometimes mustered\r\nto the number of fifty or more. \"It is they,\" wrote Longueuil, \"who are\r\nthe instigators of revolt and the source of all our woes.\"[62] Whereupon\r\nthe Colonial Minister reiterated his instructions to drive them off and\r\nplunder them, which he thought would \"effectually disgust them,\" and\r\nbring all trouble to an end.[63]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: _Longueuil au Ministre, 21 Avril, 1752._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: _Le Ministre à la Jonquière, 1752. Le Ministre à Duquesne,\r\n9 Juillet, 1752._]\r\n\r\nLa Jonquière's remedy had been more heroic, for he had ordered Céleron\r\nto attack the English and their red allies alike; and he charged that\r\nofficer with arrogance and disobedience because he had not done so. It\r\nis not certain that obedience was easy; for though, besides the garrison\r\nof regulars, a strong body of militia was sent up to Detroit to aid the\r\nstroke,[64] the Indians of that post, whose co-operation was thought\r\nnecessary, proved half-hearted, intractable, and even touched with\r\ndisaffection. Thus the enterprise languished till, in June, aid came\r\nfrom another quarter. Charles Langlade, a young French trader married to\r\na squaw at Green Bay, and strong in influence with the tribes of that\r\nregion, came down the lakes from Michillimackinac with a fleet of canoes\r\nmanned by two hundred and fifty Ottawa and Ojibwa warriors; stopped a\r\nwhile at Detroit; then embarked again, paddled up the Maumee to\r\nRaymond's fort at the portage, and led his greased and painted rabble\r\nthrough the forest to attack the Demoiselle and his English friends.\r\nThey approached Pickawillany at about nine o'clock on the morning of the\r\ntwenty-first. The scared squaws fled from the cornfields into the town,\r\nwhere the wigwams of the Indians clustered about the fortified warehouse\r\nof the traders. Of these there were at the time only eight in the place.\r\nMost of the Indians also were gone on their summer hunt, though the\r\nDemoiselle remained with a band of his tribesmen. Great was the\r\nscreeching of war-whoops and clatter of guns. Three of the traders were\r\ncaught outside the fort. The remaining five closed the gate, and stood\r\non their defence. The fight was soon over. Fourteen Miamis were shot\r\ndown, the Demoiselle among the rest. The five white men held out till\r\nthe afternoon, when three of them surrendered, and two, Thomas Burney\r\nand Andrew McBryer, made their escape. One of the English prisoners\r\nbeing wounded, the victors stabbed him to death. Seventy years of\r\nmissionaries had not weaned them from cannibalism, and they boiled and\r\neat the Demoiselle.[65]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: _La Jonquière à Céleron, 1 Oct. 1751._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: On the attack of Pickawillany, _Longueuil au Ministre, 18\r\nAoût, 1752; Duquesne au Ministre, 25 Oct. 1752; Colonial Records of\r\nPa._, V. 599; _Journal of William Trent_, 1752. Trent was on the spot a\r\nfew days after the affair.]\r\n\r\nThe captive traders, plundered to the skin, were carried by Langlade to\r\nDuquesne, the new governor, who highly praised the bold leader of the\r\nenterprise, and recommended him to the Minister for such reward as\r\nbefitted one of his station. \"As he is not in the King's service, and\r\nhas married a squaw, I will ask for him only a pension of two hundred\r\nfrancs, which will flatter him infinitely.\"\r\n\r\nThe Marquis Duquesne, sprung from the race of the great naval commander\r\nof that name, had arrived towards midsummer; and he began his rule by a\r\ngeneral review of troops and militia. His lofty bearing offended the\r\nCanadians; but he compelled their respect, and, according to a writer of\r\nthe time, showed from the first that he was born to command. He\r\npresently took in hand an enterprise which his predecessor would\r\nprobably have accomplished, had the Home Government encouraged him.\r\nDuquesne, profiting by the infatuated neglect of the British provincial\r\nassemblies, prepared to occupy the upper waters of the Ohio, and secure\r\nthe passes with forts and garrisons. Thus the Virginian and\r\nPennsylvanian traders would be debarred all access to the West, and the\r\ntribes of that region, bereft henceforth of English guns, knives,\r\nhatchets, and blankets, English gifts and English cajoleries, would be\r\nthrown back to complete dependence on the French. The moral influence,\r\ntoo, of such a movement would be incalculable; for the Indian respects\r\nnothing so much as a display of vigor and daring, backed by force. In\r\nshort, the intended enterprise was a master-stroke, and laid the axe to\r\nthe very root of disaffection. It is true that, under the treaty,\r\ncommissioners had been long in session at Paris to settle the question\r\nof American boundaries; but there was no likelihood that they would come\r\nto agreement; and if France would make good her Western claims, it\r\nbehooved her, while there was yet time, to prevent her rival from\r\nfastening a firm grasp on the countries in dispute.\r\n\r\nYet the Colonial Minister regarded the plan with distrust. \"Be on your\r\nguard,\" he wrote to Duquesne, \"against new undertakings; private\r\ninterests are generally at the bottom of them. It is through these that\r\nnew posts are established. Keep only such as are indispensable, and\r\nsuppress the others. The expenses of the colony are enormous; and they\r\nhave doubled since the peace.\" Again, a little later: \"Build on the Ohio\r\nsuch forts as are absolutely necessary, but no more. Remember that His\r\nMajesty suspects your advisers of interested views.\"[66]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: _Ordres du Roy et Dépêches des Ministres_, 1753.]\r\n\r\nNo doubt there was justice in the suspicion. Every military movement,\r\nand above all the establishment of every new post, was an opportunity to\r\nthe official thieves with whom the colony swarmed. Some band of favored\r\nknaves grew rich; while a much greater number, excluded from sharing the\r\nillicit profits, clamored against the undertaking, and wrote charges of\r\ncorruption to Versailles. Thus the Minister was kept tolerably well\r\ninformed; but was scarcely the less helpless, for with the Atlantic\r\nbetween, the disorders of Canada defied his control. Duquesne was\r\nexasperated by the opposition that met him on all hands, and wrote to\r\nthe Minister: \"There are so many rascals in this country that one is\r\nforever the butt of their attacks.\"[67]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: _Duquesne au Ministre, 29 Sept._ 1754.]\r\n\r\nIt seems that unlawful gain was not the only secret spring of the\r\nmovement. An officer of repute says that the Intendant, Bigot,\r\nenterprising in his pleasures as in his greed, was engaged in an\r\nintrigue with the wife of Chevalier Péan; and wishing at once to console\r\nthe husband and to get rid of him, sought for him a high command at a\r\ndistance from the colony. Therefore while Marin, an able officer, was\r\nmade first in rank, Péan was made second. The same writer hints that\r\nDuquesne himself was influenced by similar motives in his appointment of\r\nleaders.[68]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: Pouchot, _Mémoire sur la dernière Guerre de l'Amérique\r\nseptentrionale (ed._ 1781), I. 8.]\r\n\r\nHe mustered the colony troops, and ordered out the Canadians. With the\r\nformer he was but half satisfied; with the latter he was delighted; and\r\nhe praises highly their obedience and alacrity. \"I had not the least\r\ntrouble in getting them to march. They came on the minute, bringing\r\ntheir own guns, though many people tried to excite them to revolt; for\r\nthe whole colony opposes my operations.\" The expedition set out early in\r\nthe spring of 1753. The whole force was not much above a thousand men,\r\nincreased by subsequent detachments to fifteen hundred; but to the\r\nIndians it seemed a mighty host; and one of their orators declared that\r\nthe lakes and rivers were covered with boats and soldiers from Montreal\r\nto Presquisle.[69] Some Mohawk hunters by the St. Lawrence saw them as\r\nthey passed, and hastened home to tell the news to Johnson, whom they\r\nwakened at midnight, \"whooping and hollowing in a frightful manner.\"[70]\r\nLieutenant Holland at Oswego saw a fleet of canoes upon the lake, and\r\nwas told by a roving Frenchman that they belonged to an army of six\r\nthousand men going to the Ohio, \"to cause all the English to quit those\r\nparts.\"[71]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: _Duquesne au Ministre, 27 Oct._ 1753.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: _Johnson to Clinton, 20 April_, 1753, in _N.Y. Col.\r\nDocs._, VI. 778.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: _Holland to Clinton, 15 May_, 1753, in _N.Y. Col. Docs._,\r\nVI. 780.]\r\n\r\nThe main body of the expedition landed at Presquisle, on the\r\nsoutheastern shore of Lake Erie, where the town of Erie now stands; and\r\nhere for a while we leave them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\n1710-1754\r\n\r\nConflict for Acadia\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile in the West all the signs of the sky foreboded storm, another\r\ntempest was gathering the East, less in extent, but not less in peril.\r\nThe conflict in Acadia has a melancholy interest, since it ended in a\r\ncastastrophe which prose and verse have joined to commemorate, but of\r\nwhich the causes have not been understood.\r\n\r\nAcadia--that it to say, the peninsula of Nova Scotia, with the addition,\r\nas the English claimed, of the present New Brunswick and some adjacent\r\ncountry--was conquered by General Nicholson in 1710, and formally\r\ntransferred by France to the British Crown, three years later, by the\r\ntreaty of Utrecht. By that treaty it was \"expressly provided\" that such\r\nof the French inhabitants as \"are willing to remain there and to be\r\nsubject to the Kingdom of Great Britain, are to enjoy the free exercise\r\nof their religion according to the usage of the Church of Rome, as far\r\nas the laws of Great Britain do allow the same\"; but that any who choose\r\nmay remove, with their effects, if they do so within a year. Very few\r\navailed themselves of this right; and after the end of the year those\r\nwho remained were required to take an oath of allegiance to King George.\r\nThere is no doubt that in a little time they would have complied, had\r\nthey been let alone; but the French authorities of Canada and Cape\r\nBreton did their utmost to prevent them, and employed agents to keep\r\nthem hostile to England. Of these the most efficient were the French\r\npriests, who, in spite of the treaty, persuaded their flocks that they\r\nwere still subjects of King Louis. Hence rose endless perplexity to the\r\nEnglish commanders at Annapolis, who more than suspected that the Indian\r\nattacks with which they were harassed were due mainly to French\r\ninstigation.[72] It was not till seventeen years after the treaty that\r\nthe Acadians could be brought to take the oath without qualifications\r\nwhich made it almost useless. The English authorities seem to have shown\r\nthroughout an unusual patience and forbearance. At length, about 1730,\r\nnearly all the inhabitants signed by crosses, since few of them could\r\nwrite, an oath recognizing George II as sovereign of Acadia, and\r\npromising fidelity and obedience to him.[73] This restored comparative\r\nquiet till the war of 1745, when some of the Acadians remained neutral,\r\nwhile some took arms against the English, and many others aided the\r\nenemy with information and supplies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: See the numerous papers in _Selections from the Public\r\nDocuments of the Province of Nova Scotia_ (Halifax, 1869), pp. 1-165; a\r\nGovernment publication of great value.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: The oath was _literatim_ as follows: \"Je Promets et Jure\r\nSincerement en Foi de Chrétien que Je serai entierement Fidele, et\r\nObeierai Vraiment Sa Majesté Le Roy George Second, qui (_sic_) Je\r\nreconnoi pour Le Souvrain Seigneur de l'Accadie ou Nouvelle Ecosse.\r\nAinsi Dieu me Soit en Aide.\"]\r\n\r\nEnglish power in Acadia, hitherto limited to a feeble garrison at\r\nAnnapolis and a feebler one at Canseau, received at this time a great\r\naccession. The fortress of Louisbourg, taken by the English during the\r\nwar, had been restored by the treaty; and the French at once prepared to\r\nmake it a military and naval station more formidable than ever. Upon\r\nthis the British Ministry resolved to establish another station as a\r\ncounterpoise; and the harbor of Chebucto, on the south coast of Acadia,\r\nwas chosen as the site of it. Thither in June, 1749, came a fleet of\r\ntransports loaded with emigrants, tempted by offers of land and a home\r\nin the New World. Some were mechanics, tradesmen, farmers, and laborers;\r\nothers were sailors, soldiers, and subaltern officers thrown out of\r\nemployment by the peace. Including women and children, they counted in\r\nall about twenty-five hundred. Alone of all the British colonies on the\r\ncontinent, this new settlement was the offspring, not of private\r\nenterprise, but of royal authority. Yet is was free like the rest, with\r\nthe same popular representation and local self-government. Edward\r\nCornwallis, uncle of Lord Cornwallis of the Revolutionary War, was made\r\ngovernor and commander-in-chief. Wolfe calls him \"a man of approved\r\ncourage and fidelity\"; and even the caustic Horace Walpole speaks of him\r\nas \"a brave, sensible young man, of great temper and good nature.\"\r\n\r\nBefore summer was over, the streets were laid out, and the building-lot\r\nof each settler was assigned to him; before winter closed, the whole\r\nwere under shelter, the village was fenced with palisades and defended\r\nby redoubts of timber, and the battalions lately in garrison at\r\nLouisbourg manned the wooden ramparts. Succeeding years brought more\r\nemigrants, and in 1752 the population was above four thousand. Thus was\r\nborn into the world the city of Halifax. Along with the crumbling old\r\nfort and miserably disciplined garrison at Annapolis, besides six or\r\nseven small detached posts to watch the Indians and Acadians, it\r\ncomprised the whole British force on the peninsula; for Canseau had been\r\ndestroyed by the French.\r\n\r\nThe French had never reconciled themselves to the loss of Acadia, and\r\nwere resolved, by diplomacy or force, to win it back again; but the\r\nbuilding of Halifax showed that this was to be no easy task, and filled\r\nthem at the same time with alarm for the safety of Louisbourg. On one\r\npoint, at least, they saw their policy clear. The Acadians, though those\r\nof them who were not above thirty-five had been born under the British\r\nflag, must be kept French at heart, and taught that they were still\r\nFrench subjects. In 1748 they numbered eighty-eight hundred and fifty\r\ncommunicants, or from twelve to thirteen thousand souls; but an\r\nemigration, of which the causes will soon appear, had reduced them in\r\n1752 to but little more than nine thousand.[74] These were divided into\r\nsix principal parishes, one of the largest being that of Annapolis.\r\nOther centres of population were Grand Pré, on the basin of Mines;\r\nBeaubassin, at the head of Chignecto Bay; Pisiquid, now Windsor; and\r\nCobequid, now Truro. Their priests, who were missionaries controlled by\r\nthe diocese of Quebec, acted also as their magistrates, ruling them for\r\nthis world and the next. Bring subject to a French superior, and being,\r\nmoreover, wholly French at heart, they formed in this British province a\r\nwheel within a wheel, the inner movement always opposing the outer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: _Description de l'Acadie, avec le Nom des Paroisses et le\r\nNombre des Habitants, 1748. Mémoire à présenter à la Cour sur la\r\nnecessité de fixer les Limites de l'Acadie,_ par l'Abbé de l'Isle-Dieu,\r\n1753 (1754?). Compare the estimates in _Censuses of Canada_ (Ottawa,\r\n1876.)]\r\n\r\nAlthough, by the twelfth article of the treaty of Utrecht, France had\r\nsolemnly declared the Acadians to be British subjects, the Government of\r\nLouis XV intrigued continually to turn them from subjects into enemies.\r\nBefore me is a mass of English documents on Acadian affairs from the\r\npeace of Aix-la-Chapelle to the catastrophe of 1755, and above a\r\nthousand pages of French official papers from the archives of Paris,\r\nmemorials, reports, and secret correspondence, relating to the same\r\nmatters. With the help of these and some collateral lights, it is not\r\ndifficult to make a correct diagnosis of the political disease that\r\nravaged this miserable country. Of a multitude of proofs, only a few can\r\nbe given here; but these will suffice.\r\n\r\nIt was not that the Acadians had been ill-used by the English; the\r\nreverse was the case. They had been left in free exercise of their\r\nworship, as stipulated by treaty. It is true that, from time to time,\r\nthere were loud complaints from French officials that religion was in\r\ndanger, because certain priests had been rebuked, arrested, brought\r\nbefore the Council at Halifax, suspended from their functions, or\r\nrequired, on pain of banishment, to swear that they would do nothing\r\nagainst the interests of King George. Yet such action on the part of the\r\nprovincial authorities seems, without a single exception, to have been\r\nthe consequence of misconduct on the part of the priest, in opposing the\r\nGovernment and stirring his flock to disaffection. La Jonquière, the\r\ndetermined adversary of the English, reported to the bishop that they\r\ndid not oppose the ecclesiastics in the exercise of their functions, and\r\nan order of Louis XV admits that the Acadians have enjoyed liberty of\r\nreligion.[75] In a long document addressed in 1750 to the Colonial\r\nMinister at Versailles, Roma, an officer at Louisbourg, testifies thus\r\nto the mildness of British rule, though he ascribes it to interested\r\nmotives. \"The fear that the Acadians have of the Indians is the\r\ncontrolling motive which makes them side with the French. The English,\r\nhaving in view the conquest of Canada, wished to give the French of that\r\ncolony, in their conduct towards the Acadians, a striking example of\r\nthe mildness of their government. Without raising the fortune of any of\r\nthe inhabitants, they have supplied them for more than thirty-five years\r\nwith the necessaries of life, often on credit and with an excess of\r\nconfidence, without troubling their debtors, without pressing them,\r\nwithout wishing to force them to pay. They have left them an appearance\r\nof liberty so excessive that they have not intervened in their disputes\r\nor even punished their crimes. They have allowed them to refuse with\r\ninsolence certain moderate rents payable in grain and lawfully due. They\r\nhave passed over in silence the contemptuous refusal of the Acadians to\r\ntake titles from them for the new lands which they chose to occupy.[76]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: _La Jonquière à Évêque de Québec, 14 Juin, 1750. Mémoire\r\ndu Roy pour servir d'Instruction au Comte de Raymond, commandant pour Sa\r\nMajesté à l'Isle Royale_ [Cape Breton], _24 Avril, 1751_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: See Appendix B.]\r\n\r\n\"We know very well,\" pursues Roma, \"the fruits of this conduct in the\r\nlast war; and the English know it also. Judge then what will be the\r\nwrath and vengeance of this cruel nation.\" The fruits to which Roma\r\nalludes were the hostilities, open or secret, committed by the Acadians\r\nagainst the English. He now ventures the prediction that the enraged\r\nconquerors will take their revenge by drafting all the young Acadians on\r\nboard their ships of war, and there destroying them by slow starvation.\r\nHe proved, however, a false prophet. The English Governor merely\r\nrequired the inhabitants to renew their oath of allegiance, without\r\nqualification or evasion.\r\n\r\nIt was twenty years since the Acadians had taken such an oath; and\r\nmeanwhile a new generation had grown up. The old oath pledged them to\r\nfidelity and obedience; but they averred that Phillips, then governor of\r\nthe province, had given them, at the same time, assurance that they\r\nshould not be required to bear arms against either French or Indians. In\r\nfact, such service had not been demanded of them, and they would have\r\nlived in virtual neutrality, had not many of them broken their oaths and\r\njoined the French war-parties. For this reason Cornwallis thought it\r\nnecessary that, in renewing the pledge, they should bind themselves to\r\nan allegiance as complete as that required of other British subjects.\r\nThis spread general consternation. Deputies from the Acadian\r\nsettlements appeared at Halifax, bringing a paper signed with the marks\r\nof a thousand persons. The following passage contains the pith of it.\r\n\"The inhabitants in general, sir, over the whole extent of this country\r\nare resolved not to take the oath which your Excellency requires of us;\r\nbut if your Excellency will grant us our old oath, with an exemption for\r\nourselves and our heirs from taking up arms, we will accept it.\"[77] The\r\nanswer of Cornwallis was by no means so stern as it has been\r\nrepresented.[78] After the formal reception he talked in private with\r\nthe deputies; and \"they went home in good humor, promising great\r\nthings.\"[79]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: _Public Documents of Nova Scotia_, 173.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: See _Ibid._, 174, where the answer is printed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: _Cornwallis to the Board of Trade, 11 Sept. 1749._]\r\n\r\nThe refusal of the Acadians to take the required oath was not wholly\r\nspontaneous, but was mainly due to influence from without. The French\r\nofficials of Cape Breton and Isle St. Jean, now Prince Edward Island,\r\nexerted themselves to the utmost, chiefly through the agency of the\r\npriests, to excite the people to refuse any oath that should commit them\r\nfully to British allegiance. At the same time means were used to induce\r\nthem to migrate to the neighboring islands under French rule, and\r\nefforts were also made to set on the Indians to attack the English. But\r\nthe plans of the French will best appear in a despatch sent by La\r\nJonquière to the Colonial Minister in the autumn of 1749.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Cornwallis issued an order on the tenth of the said month\r\n[_August_], to the effect that if the inhabitants will remain faithful\r\nsubjects of the King of Great Britain, he will allow them priests and\r\npublic exercise of their religion, with the understanding that no priest\r\nshall officiate without his permission or before taking an oath of\r\nfidelity to the King of Great Britain. Secondly, that the inhabitants\r\nshall not be exempted from defending their houses, their lands, and the\r\nGovernment. Thirdly, that they shall take an oath of fidelity to the\r\nKing of Great Britain, on the twenty-sixth of this month, before\r\nofficers sent them for that purpose.\"\r\n\r\nLa Jonquière proceeds to say that on hearing these conditions the\r\nAcadians were filled with perplexity and alarm, and that he, the\r\ngovernor, had directed Boishébert, his chief officer on the Acadian\r\nfrontier, to encourage them to leave their homes and seek asylum on\r\nFrench soil. He thus recounts the steps he has taken to harass the\r\nEnglish of Halifax by means of their Indian neighbors. As peace had been\r\ndeclared, the operation was delicate; and when three of these Indians\r\ncame to him from their missionary, Le Loutre, with letters on the\r\nsubject, La Jonquière was discreetly reticent. \"I did not care to give\r\nthem any advice upon the matter, and confined myself to a promise that I\r\nwould on no account abandon them; and I have provided for supplying them\r\nwith everything, whether arms, ammunition, food, or other necessaries.\r\nIt is to be desired that these savages should succeed in thwarting the\r\ndesigns of the English, and even their settlement at Halifax. They are\r\nbent on doing so; and if they can carry out their plans, it is certain\r\nthat they will give the English great trouble, and so harass them that\r\nthey will be a great obstacle in their path. These savages are to act\r\nalone; neither soldier nor French inhabitant is to join them; everything\r\nwill be done of their own motion, and without showing that I had any\r\nknowledge of the matter. This is very essential; therefore I have\r\nwritten to the Sieur de Boishébert to observe great prudence in his\r\nmeasures, and to act very secretly, in order that the English may not\r\nperceive that we are providing for the needs of the said savages.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be the missionaries who will manage all the negotiation, and\r\ndirect the movements of the savages, who are in excellent hands, as the\r\nReverend Father Germain and Monsieur l'Abbé Le Loutre are very capable\r\nof making the most of them, and using them to the greatest advantage for\r\nour interests. They will manage their intrigue in such a way as not to\r\nappear in it.\"\r\n\r\nLa Jonquière then recounts the good results which he expects from these\r\nmeasures: first, the English will be prevented from making any new\r\nsettlements; secondly, we shall gradually get the Acadians out of their\r\nhands; and lastly, they will be so discouraged by constant Indian\r\nattacks that they will renounce their pretensions to the parts of the\r\ncountry belonging to the King of France. \"I feel, Monseigneur,\"--thus\r\nthe Governor concludes his despatch,--\"all the delicacy of this\r\nnegotiation; be assured that I will conduct it with such precaution that\r\nthe English will not be able to say that my orders had any part in\r\nit.\"[80]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: _La Jonquière au Ministre, 9 Oct. 1749_. See Appendix B.]\r\n\r\nHe kept his word, and so did the missionaries. The Indians gave great\r\ntrouble on the outskirts of Halifax, and murdered many harmless\r\nsettlers; yet the English authorities did not at first suspect that they\r\nwere hounded on by their priests, under the direction of the Governor\r\nof Canada, and with the privity of the Minister at Versailles. More than\r\nthis; for, looking across the sea, we find royalty itself lending its\r\naugust countenance to the machination. Among the letters read before the\r\nKing in his cabinet in May, 1750, was one from Desherbiers, then\r\ncommanding at Louisbourg, saying that he was advising the Acadians not\r\nto take the oath of allegiance to the King of England; another from Le\r\nLoutre, declaring that he and Father Germain were consulting together\r\nhow to disgust the English with their enterprise of Halifax; and a third\r\nfrom the Intendant, Bigot, announcing that Le Loutre was using the\r\nIndians to harass the new settlement, and that he himself was sending\r\nthem powder, lead, and merchandise, \"to confirm them in their good\r\ndesigns.\"[81]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: _Resumé des Lettres lues au Travail du Roy, Mai, 1750_.]\r\n\r\nTo this the Minister replies in a letter to Desherbiers: \"His Majesty is\r\nwell satisfied with all you have done to thwart the English in their new\r\nestablishment. If the dispositions of the savages are such as they seem,\r\nthere is reason to hope that in the course of the winter they will\r\nsucceed in so harassing the settlers that some of them will become\r\ndisheartened.\" Desherbiers is then told that His Majesty desires him to\r\naid English deserters in escaping from Halifax.[82] Supplies for the\r\nIndians are also promised; and he is informed that twelve medals are\r\nsent him by the frigate \"La Mutine,\" to be given to the chiefs who shall\r\nmost distinguish themselves. In another letter Desherbiers is enjoined\r\nto treat the English authorities with great politeness.[83]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: In 1750 nine captured deserters from Phillips's regiment\r\ndeclared on their trial that the French had aided them and supplied them\r\nall with money. _Public Documents of Nova Scotia_, 193.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: _Le Ministre à Desherbiers, 23 Mai, 1750; Ibid., 31 Mai,\r\n1750_.]\r\n\r\nWhen Count Raymond took command at Louisbourg, he was instructed, under\r\nthe royal hand, to give particular attention to the affairs of Acadia,\r\nespecially in two points,--the management of the Indians, and the\r\nencouraging of Acadian emigration to countries under French rule. \"His\r\nMajesty,\" says the document, \"has already remarked that the savages have\r\nbeen most favorably disposed. It is of the utmost importance that no\r\nmeans be neglected to keep them so. The missionaries among them are in a\r\nbetter position than anybody to contribute to this end, and His Majesty\r\nhas reason to be satisfied with the pains they take therein. The Sieur\r\nde Raymond will excite these missionaries not to slacken their efforts;\r\nbut he will warn them at the same time so to contain their zeal as not\r\nto compromise themselves with the English, and give just occasion of\r\ncomplaint.\"[84] That is, the King orders his representative to encourage\r\nthe missionaries in instigating their flocks to butcher English\r\nsettlers, but to see that they take care not to be found out. The\r\ninjunction was hardly needed. \"Monsieur Desherbiers,\" says a letter of\r\nearlier date, \"has engaged Abbé Le Loutre to distribute the usual\r\npresents among the savages, and Monsieur Bigot has placed in his hands\r\nan additional gift of cloth, blankets, powder, and ball, to be given\r\nthem in case they harass the English at Halifax. This missionary is to\r\ninduce them to do so.\"[85] In spite of these efforts, the Indians began\r\nto relent in their hostilities; and when Longueuil became provisional\r\ngovernor of Canada, he complained to the Minister that it was very\r\ndifficult to prevent them from making peace with the English, though\r\nFather Germain was doing his best to keep them on the war-path.[86]\r\nLa Jonquière, too, had done his best, even to the point of departing\r\nfrom his original policy of allowing no soldier or Acadian to take part\r\nwith them. He had sent a body of troops under La Corne, an able partisan\r\nofficer, to watch the English frontier; and in the same vessel was sent\r\na supply of \"merchandise, guns, and munitions for the savages and the\r\nAcadians who may take up arms with them; and the whole is sent under\r\npretext of trading in furs with the savages.\"[87] On another occasion\r\nLa Jonquière wrote: \"In order that the savages may do their part\r\ncourageously, a few Acadians, dressed and painted in their way, could\r\njoin them to strike the English. I cannot help consenting to what these\r\nsavages do, because we have our hands tied [_by the peace_],\r\nand so can do nothing ourselves. Besides, I do not think that any\r\ninconvenience will come of letting the Acadians mingle among them,\r\nbecause if they [_the Acadians_] are captured, we shall say that they\r\nacted of their own accord.\"[88] In other words, he will encourage them\r\nto break the peace; and then, by means of a falsehood, have them\r\npunished as felons. Many disguised Acadians did in fact join the Indian\r\nwar-parties; and their doing so was no secret to the English. \"What we\r\ncall here an Indian war,\" wrote Hopson, successor of Cornwallis, \"is no\r\nother than a pretence for the French to commit hostilities on His\r\nMajesty's subjects.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: _Mémoire du Roy pour servir d'Instruction au Comte de\r\nRaymond, 24 Avril, 1751_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: _Lettre commune de Desherbiers et Bigot au Ministre, 15\r\nAoût, 1749_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: _Longueuil au Ministre, 26 Avril, 1752_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: _Bigot au Ministre, 1749_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: _Dépêches de la Jonquière, 1 Mai, 1751_. See Appendix B.]\r\n\r\nAt length the Indians made peace, or pretended to do so. The chief of Le\r\nLoutre's mission, who called himself Major Jean-Baptiste Cope, came to\r\nHalifax with a deputation of his tribe, and they all affixed their\r\ntotems to a solemn treaty. In the next summer they returned with ninety\r\nor a hundred warriors, were well entertained, presented with gifts, and\r\nsent homeward in a schooner. On the way they seized the vessel and\r\nmurdered the crew. This is told by Prévost, intendant at Louisbourg, who\r\ndoes not say that French instigation had any part in the treachery.[89]\r\nIt is nevertheless certain that the Indians were paid for this or some\r\ncontemporary murder; for Prévost, writing just four weeks later, says:\r\n\"Last month the savages took eighteen English scalps, and Monsieur Le\r\nLoutre was obliged to pay them eighteen hundred livres, Acadian money,\r\nwhich I have reimbursed him.\"[90]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: _Prévost au Ministre, 12 Mars, 1753; Ibid., 17 July_,\r\n1753. Prévost was _ordonnateur_, or intendant, at Louisbourg. The treaty\r\nwill be found in full in _Public Documents of Nova Scotia_, 683.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: _Prévost au Ministre, 16 Août_, 1753.]\r\n\r\nFrom the first, the services of this zealous missionary had been beyond\r\nprice. Prévost testifies that, though Cornwallis does his best to induce\r\nthe Acadians to swear fidelity to King George, Le Loutre keeps them in\r\nallegiance to King Louis, and threatens to set his Indians upon them\r\nunless they declare against the English. \"I have already,\" adds Prévost,\r\n\"paid him 11,183 livres for his daily expenses; and I never cease\r\nadvising him to be as economical as possible, and always to take care\r\nnot to compromise himself with the English Government.\"[91] In\r\nconsequence of \"good service to religion and the state,\" Le Loutre\r\nreceived a pension of eight hundred livres, as did also Maillard, his\r\nbrother missionary on Cape Breton. \"The fear is,\" writes the Colonial\r\nMinister to the Governor of Louisbourg, \"that their zeal may carry them\r\ntoo far. Excite them to keep the Indians in our interests, but do not\r\nlet them compromise us. Act always so as to make the English appear as\r\naggressors.\"[92]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: _Ibid., 22 Juillet_, 1750.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: _Le Ministre au Comte de Raymond, 21 Juillet_, 1752. It is\r\ncurious to compare these secret instructions, given by the Minister to\r\nthe colonial officials, with a letter which the same Minister, Rouillé,\r\nwrote ostensibly to La Jonquière, but which was really meant for the eye\r\nof the British Minister at Versailles, Lord Albemarle, to whom it was\r\nshown in proof of French good faith. It was afterwards printed, long\r\nwith other papers, in a small volume called _Précis des Faits, avec\r\nPièces justificatives_ which was sent by the French Government to all\r\nthe courts of Europe to show that the English alone were answerable for\r\nthe war. The letter, it is needless to say, breathes the highest\r\nsentiments of international honor.]\r\n\r\nAll the Acadian clergy, in one degree or another, seem to have used\r\ntheir influence to prevent the inhabitants from taking the oath, and to\r\npersuade them that they were still French subjects. Some were noisy,\r\nturbulent, and defiant; others were too tranquil to please the officers\r\nof the Crown. A missionary at Annapolis is mentioned as old, and\r\ntherefore inefficient; while the curé at Grand Pré, also an elderly man,\r\nwas too much inclined to confine himself to his spiritual functions. It\r\nis everywhere apparent that those who chose these priests, and sent them\r\nas missionaries into a British province, expected them to act as enemies\r\nof the British Crown. The maxim is often repeated that duty to religion\r\nis inseparable from the duty to the King of France. The Bishop of Quebec\r\ndesired the Abbé de l'Isle-Dieu to represent to the court the need of\r\nmore missionaries to keep the Acadians Catholic and French; but, he\r\nadds, there is danger that they (the missionaries) will be required to\r\ntake an oath to do nothing contrary to the interests of the King of\r\nGreat Britain.[93] It is a wonder that such a pledge was not always\r\ndemanded. It was exacted in a few cases, notably in that of Girard,\r\npriest at Cobequid, who, on charges of instigating his flock to\r\ndisaffection, had been sent prisoner to Halifax, but released on taking\r\nan oath in the above terms. Thereupon he wrote to Longueuil at Quebec\r\nthat his parishioners wanted to submit to the English, and that he,\r\nhaving sworn to be true to the British King, could not prevent them.\r\n\"Though I don't pretend to be a casuist,\" writes Longueuil, \"I could not\r\nhelp answering him that he is not obliged to keep such an oath, and that\r\nhe ought to labor in all zeal to preserve and increase the number of the\r\nfaithful.\" Girard, to his credit, preferred to leave the colony, and\r\nretired to Isle St. Jean.[94]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: L'Isle-Dieu, _Mémoire sur l'État actuel des Missions,\r\n1753_ (1754?).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: _Longueuil au Ministre, 27 Avril, 1752_.]\r\n\r\nCornwallis soon discovered to what extent the clergy stirred their\r\nflocks to revolt; and he wrote angrily to the Bishop of Quebec: \"Was it\r\nyou who sent Le Loutre as a missionary to the Micmacs? and is it for\r\ntheir good that he excites these wretches to practise their cruelties\r\nagainst those who have shown them every kindness? The conduct of the\r\npriests of Acadia has been such that by command of his Majesty I have\r\npublished an Order declaring that if any one of them presumes to\r\nexercise his functions without my express permission he shall be dealt\r\nwith according to the laws of England.\"[95]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: _Cornwallis to the Bishop of Quebec, 1 Dec. 1749_.]\r\n\r\nThe English, bound by treaty to allow the Acadians the exercise of their\r\nreligion, at length conceived the idea of replacing the French priests\r\nby others to be named by the Pope at the request of the British\r\nGovernment. This, becoming known to the French, greatly alarmed them,\r\nand the Intendant at Louisbourg wrote to the Minister that the matter\r\nrequired serious attention.[96] It threatened, in fact, to rob them of\r\ntheir chief agents of intrigue; but their alarm proved needless, as the\r\nplan was not carried into execution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: _Daudin, prêtre, à Prévost, 23 Oct. 1753. Prévost au\r\nMinistre, 24 Nov. 1753_.]\r\n\r\nThe French officials would have been better pleased had the conduct of\r\nCornwallis been such as to aid their efforts to alienate the Acadians;\r\nand one writer, while confessing the \"favorable treatment\" of the\r\nEnglish towards the inhabitants, denounces it as a snare.[97] If so, it\r\nwas a snare intended simply to reconcile them to English rule. Nor was\r\nit without effect. \"We must give up altogether the idea of an\r\ninsurrection in Acadia,\" writes an officer of Cape Breton. \"The Acadians\r\ncannot be trusted; they are controlled by fear of the Indians, which\r\nleads them to breathe French sentiments, even when their inclinations\r\nare English. They will yield to their interests; and the English will\r\nmake it impossible that they should either hurt them or serve us, unless\r\nwe take measures different from those we have hitherto pursued.\"[98]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: _Mémoire à présenter à la Cour, 1753_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: _Roma au Ministre, 11 Mars, 1750_.]\r\n\r\nDuring all this time, constant efforts were made to stimulate Acadian\r\nemigration to French territory, and thus to strengthen the French\r\nfrontier. In this work the chief agent was Le Loutre. \"This priest,\"\r\nsays a French writer of the time, \"urged the people of Les Mines, Port\r\nRoyal [_Annapolis_], and other places, to come and join the French, and\r\npromised to all, in the name of the Governor, to settle and support them\r\nfor three years, and even indemnify them for any losses they might\r\nincur; threatening if they did not do as he advised, to abandon them,\r\ndeprive them of their priests, have their wives and children carried\r\noff, and their property laid waste by the Indians.\"[99] Some passed over\r\nthe isthmus to the shores of the gulf, and others made their way to the\r\nStrait of Canseau. Vessels were provided to convey them, in the one case\r\nto Isle St. Jean, now Prince Edward Island, and in the other to Isle\r\nRoyale, called by the English, Cape Breton. Some were eager to go; some\r\nwent with reluctance; some would scarcely be persuaded to go at all.\r\n\"They leave their homes with great regret,\" reports the Governor of Isle\r\nSt. Jean, speaking of the people of Cobequid, \"and they began to move\r\ntheir luggage only when the savages compelled them.\"[100] These savages\r\nwere the flock of Abbé Le Loutre, who was on the spot to direct the\r\nemigration. Two thousand Acadians are reported to have left the\r\npeninsula before the end of 1751, and many more followed within the next\r\ntwo years. Nothing could exceed the misery of a great part of these\r\nemigrants, who had left perforce most of their effects behind. They\r\nbecame disheartened and apathetic. The Intendant at Louisbourg says that\r\nthey will not take the trouble to clear the land, and that some of them\r\nlive, like Indians, under huts of spruce-branches.[101] The Governor of\r\nIsle St. Jean declares that they are dying of hunger.[102] Girard, the\r\npriest who had withdrawn to this island rather than break his oath to\r\nthe English, writes: \"Many of them cannot protect themselves day or\r\nnight from the severity of the cold. Most of the children are entirely\r\nnaked; and when I go into a house they are all crouched in the ashes,\r\nclose to the fire. They run off and hide themselves, without shoes,\r\nstockings, or shirts. They are not all reduced to this extremity but\r\nnearly all are in want.\"[103] Mortality among them was great, and would\r\nhave been greater but for rations supplied by the French Government.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: _Mémoires sur le Canada, 1749-1760_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: _Bonaventure à Desherbiers, 26 Juin, 1751_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: _Prévost au Ministre, 25 Nov. 1750_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: _Bonaventure, ut supra_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: _Girard à (Bonaventure?), 27 Oct. 1753_.]\r\n\r\nDuring these proceedings, the English Governor, Cornwallis, seems to\r\nhave justified the character of good temper given him by Horace Walpole.\r\nHis attitude towards the Acadians remained on the whole patient and\r\nconciliatory. \"My friends,\" he replied to a deputation of them asking a\r\ngeneral permission to leave the province, \"I am not ignorant of the fact\r\nthat every means has been used to alienate the hearts of the French\r\nsubjects of His Britannic Majesty. Great advantages have been promised\r\nyou elsewhere, and you have been made to imagine that your religion was\r\nin danger. Threats even have been resorted to in order to induce you to\r\nremove to French territory. The savages are made use of to molest you;\r\nthey are to cut the throats of all who remain in their native country,\r\nattached to their own interests and faithful to the Government. You know\r\nthat certain officers and missionaries, who came from Canada last\r\nautumn, have been the cause of all our trouble during the winter. Their\r\nconduct has been horrible, without honor, probity, or conscience. Their\r\naim is to embroil you with the Government. I will not believe that they\r\nare authorized to do so by the Court of France, that being contrary to\r\ngood faith and the friendship established between the two Crowns.\"\r\n\r\nWhat foundation there was for this amiable confidence in the Court of\r\nVersailles has been seen already. \"When you declared your desire to\r\nsubmit yourselves to another Government,\" pursues Cornwallis, \"our\r\ndetermination was to hinder nobody from following what he imagined to be\r\nhis interest. We know that a forced service is worth nothing, and that a\r\nsubject compelled to be so against his will is not far from being an\r\nenemy. We confess, however, that your determination to go gives us pain.\r\nWe are aware of your industry and temperance, and that you are not\r\naddicted to any vice or debauchery. This province is your country. You\r\nand your fathers have cultivated it; naturally you ought yourselves to\r\nenjoy the fruits of your labor. Such was the design of the King, our\r\nmaster. You know that we have followed his orders. You know that we have\r\ndone everything to secure to you not only the occupation of your lands,\r\nbut the ownership of them forever. We have given you also every possible\r\nassurance of the free and public exercise of the Roman Catholic\r\nreligion. But I declare to you frankly that, according to our laws,\r\nnobody can possess lands or houses in the province who shall refuse to\r\ntake the oath of allegiance to his King when required to do so. You know\r\nvery well that there are ill-disposed and mischievous persons among you\r\nwho corrupt the others. Your inexperience, your ignorance of the affairs\r\nof government, and your habit of following the counsels of those who\r\nhave not your real interests at heart, make it an easy matter to seduce\r\nyou. In your petitions you ask for a general leave to quit the province.\r\nThe only manner in which you can do so is to follow the regulations\r\nalready established, and provide yourselves with our passport. And we\r\ndeclare that nothing shall prevent us from giving such passports to all\r\nwho ask for them, the moment peace and tranquillity are\r\nre-established.\"[104] He declares as his reason for not giving them at\r\nonce, that on crossing the frontier \"you will have to pass the French\r\ndetachments and savages assembled there, and that they compel all the\r\ninhabitants who go there to take up arms\" against the English. How well\r\nthis reason was founded will soon appear.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: The above passages are from two address of Cornwallis,\r\nread to the Acadian deputies in April and May, 1750.

See _Public\r\nDocuments of Nova Scotia_, 185-190.]\r\n\r\nHopson, the next governor, described by the French themselves as a \"mild\r\nand peaceable officer,\" was no less considerate in his treatment of the\r\nAcadians; and at the end of 1752 he issued the following order to his\r\nmilitary subordinates: \"You are to look on the French inhabitants in the\r\nsame light as the rest of His Majesty's subjects, as to the protection\r\nof the laws and government; for which reason nothing is to be taken from\r\nthem by force, or any price set upon their goods but what they\r\nthemselves agree to. And if at any time the inhabitants should\r\nobstinately refuse to comply with what His Majesty's service may require\r\nof them, you are not to redress yourself by military force or in any\r\nunlawful manner, but to lay the case before the Governor and wait his\r\norders thereon.\"[105] Unfortunately, the mild rule of Cornwallis and\r\nHopson was not always maintained under their successor, Lawrence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: _Public Documents of Nova Scotia_, 197.]\r\n\r\nLouis Joseph Le Loutre, vicar-general of Acadia and missionary to the\r\nMicmacs, was the most conspicuous person in the province, and more than\r\nany other man was answerable for the miseries that overwhelmed it. The\r\nsheep of which he was the shepherd dwelt, at a day's journey from\r\nHalifax, by the banks of the River Shubenacadie, in small cabins of\r\nlogs, mixed with wigwams of birch-bark. They were not a docile flock;\r\nand to manage them needed address, energy, and money,--with all of which\r\nthe missionary was provided. He fed their traditional dislike of the\r\nEnglish, and fanned their fanaticism, born of the villanous counterfeit\r\nof Christianity which he and his predecessors had imposed on them. Thus\r\nhe contrived to use them on the one hand to murder the English, and on\r\nthe other to terrify the Acadians; yet not without cost to the French\r\nGovernment; for they had learned the value of money, and, except when\r\ntheir blood was up, were slow to take scalps without pay. Le Loutre was\r\na man of boundless egotism, a violent spirit of domination, an intense\r\nhatred of the English, and a fanaticism that stopped at nothing. Towards\r\nthe Acadians he was a despot; and this simple and superstitious people,\r\nextremely susceptible to the influence of their priests, trembled before\r\nhim. He was scarcely less masterful in his dealings with the Acadian\r\nclergy; and, aided by his quality of the Bishop's vicar-general, he\r\ndragooned even the unwilling into aiding his schemes. Three successive\r\ngovernors of New France thought him invaluable, yet feared the\r\nimpetuosity of his zeal, and vainly tried to restrain it within safe\r\nbounds. The bishop, while approving his objects, thought his medicines\r\ntoo violent, and asked in a tone of reproof: \"Is it right for you to\r\nrefuse the Acadians the sacraments, to threaten that they shall be\r\ndeprived of the services of a priest, and that the savages shall treat\r\nthem as enemies?\"[106] \"Nobody,\" says a French Catholic contemporary,\r\n\"was more fit than he to carry discord and desolation into a\r\ncountry.\"[107] Cornwallis called him \"a good-for-nothing scoundrel,\" and\r\noffered a hundred pounds for his head.[108]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: _L'Évêque de Québec à Le Loutre_; translation in _Public\r\nDocuments of Nova Scotia_, 240.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: _Mémoires sur le Canada, 1749-1760_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: On Le Loutre, compare _Public Documents of Nova Scotia_,\r\n178-180, _note_, with authorities there cited; _N.Y. Col. Docs._, X. 11;\r\n_Mémoires sur le Canada, 1749-1760_ (Quebec, 1838).]\r\n\r\nThe authorities at Halifax, while exasperated by the perfidy practised\r\non them, were themselves not always models of international virtue. They\r\nseized a French vessel in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, on the\r\ncharge--probably true--that she was carrying arms and ammunition to the\r\nAcadians and Indians. A less defensible act was the capture of the armed\r\nbrig \"St. François,\" laden with supplies for a fort lately\r\nre-established by the French, at the mouth of the River St. John, on\r\nground claimed by both nations. Captain Rous, a New England officer\r\ncommanding a frigate in the Royal Navy, opened fire on the \"St.\r\nFrançois,\" took her after a short cannonade, and carried her into\r\nHalifax, where she was condemned by the court. Several captures of small\r\ncraft, accused of illegal acts, were also made by the English. These\r\nproceedings, being all of an overt nature, gave the officers of Louis\r\nXV. precisely what they wanted,--an occasion for uttering loud\r\ncomplaints, and denouncing the English as breakers of the peace.\r\n\r\nBut the movement most alarming to the French was the English occupation\r\nof Beaubassin,--an act perfectly lawful in itself, since, without\r\nreasonable doubt, the place was within the limits of Acadia, and\r\ntherefore on English ground.[109] Beaubassin was a considerable\r\nsettlement on the isthmus that joins the Acadian peninsula to the\r\nmainland. Northwest of the settlement lay a wide marsh, through which\r\nran a stream called the Missaguash, some two miles beyond which rose a\r\nhill called Beauséjour. On and near this hill were stationed the troops\r\nand Canadians sent under Boishébert and La Corne to watch the English\r\nfrontier. This French force excited disaffection among the Acadians\r\nthrough all the neighboring districts, and constantly helped them to\r\nemigrate. Cornwallis therefore resolved to send an English force to the\r\nspot; and accordingly, towards the end of April, 1750, Major Lawrence\r\nlanded at Beaubassin with four hundred men. News of their approach had\r\ncome before them, and Le Loutre was here with his Micmacs, mixed with\r\nsome Acadians whom he had persuaded or bullied to join him. Resolved\r\nthat the people of Beaubassin should not live under English influence,\r\nhe now with his own hand set fire to the parish church, while his white\r\nand red adherents burned the houses of the inhabitants, and thus\r\ncompelled them to cross to the French side of the river.[110] This was\r\nthe first forcible removal of the Acadians. It was as premature as it\r\nwas violent; since Lawrence, being threatened by La Corne, whose force\r\nwas several times greater than his own, presently reimbarked. In the\r\nfollowing September he returned with seventeen small vessels and about\r\nseven hundred men, and again attempted to land on the strand of\r\nBeaubassin. La Jonquière says that he could only be resisted indirectly,\r\nbecause he was on the English side of the river. This indirect\r\nresistance was undertaken by Le Loutre, who had thrown up a breastwork\r\nalong the shore and manned it with his Indians and his painted and\r\nbe-feathered Acadians. Nevertheless the English landed, and, with some\r\nloss, drove out the defenders. Le Loutre himself seems not to have been\r\namong them; but they kept up for a time a helter-skelter fight,\r\nencouraged by two other missionaries, Germain and Lalerne, who were near\r\nbeing caught by the English.[111] Lawrence quickly routed them, took\r\npossession of the cemetery, and prepared to fortify himself. The village\r\nof Beaubassin, consisting, it is said, of a hundred and forty houses,\r\nhad been burned in the spring; but there were still in the neighborhood,\r\non the English side, many hamlets and farms, with barns full of grain\r\nand hay. Le Loutre's Indians now threatened to plunder and kill the\r\ninhabitants if they did not take arms against the English. Few complied,\r\nand the greater part fled to the woods.[112] On this the Indians and\r\ntheir Acadian allies set the houses and barns on fire, and laid waste\r\nthe whole district, leaving the inhabitants no choice but to seek food\r\nand shelter with the French.[113]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: La Jonquière himself admits that he thought so. \"Cette\r\npartie là étant, à ce que je crois, dépendante de l'Acadie.\" _La\r\nJonquière au Ministre, 3 Oct. 1750_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: It has been erroneously stated that Beaubassin was burned\r\nby its own inhabitants. \"Laloutre, ayant vu que les Acadiens ne\r\nparoissoient pas fort pressés d'abandonner leurs biens, avoit lui-même\r\nmis le feu á l'Église, et l'avoit fait mettre aux maisons des habitants\r\npar quelques-uns de ceux qu'il avoit gagnés,\" etc. _Mémoires sur le\r\nCanada, 1749-1760_. \"Les sauvages y mirent le feu.\" _Précis des Faits_,\r\n85. \"Les sauvages mirent le feu aux maisons.\" _Prévost au Ministre, 22\r\nJuillet, 1750_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: La Vallière, _Journal de ce qui s'est passé à Chenitou_\r\n[Chignecto] _et autres parties des Frontières de l'Acadie, 1750-1751_.\r\nLa Vallière was an officer on the spot.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: _Prévost au Ministre, 27 Sept. 1750_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: \"Les sauvages et Accadiens mirent le feu dans toutes les\r\nmaisons et granges, pleines de bled et de fourrages, ce qui a causé une\r\ngrande disette.\" La Vallière, _ut supra_.]\r\n\r\nThe English fortified themselves on a low hill by the edge of the marsh,\r\nplanted palisades, built barracks, and named the new work Fort Lawrence.\r\nSlight skirmishes between them and the French were frequent. Neither\r\nparty respected the dividing line of the Missaguash, and a petty warfare\r\nof aggression and reprisal began, and became chronic. Before the end of\r\nthe autumn there was an atrocious act of treachery. Among the English\r\nofficers was Captain Edward Howe, an intelligent and agreeable person,\r\nwho spoke French fluently, and had been long stationed in the province.\r\nLe Loutre detested him; dreading his influence over the Acadians, by\r\nmany of whom he was known and liked. One morning, at about eight\r\no'clock, the inmates of Fort Lawrence saw what seemed an officer from\r\nBeauséjour, carrying a flag, and followed by several men in uniform,\r\nwading through the sea of grass that stretched beyond the Missaguash.\r\nWhen the tide was out, this river was but an ugly trench of reddish mud\r\ngashed across the face of the marsh, with a thread of half-fluid slime\r\nlazily crawling along the bottom; but at high tide it was filled to the\r\nbrim with an opaque torrent that would have overflowed, but for the\r\ndikes thrown up to confine it. Behind the dike on the farther bank stood\r\nthe seeming officer, waving his flag in sign that he desired a parley.\r\nHe was in reality no officer, but one of Le Loutre's Indians in\r\ndisguise, Etienne Le Bâtard, or, as others say, the great chief,\r\nJean-Baptiste Cope. Howe, carrying a white flag, and accompanied by a\r\nfew officers and men, went towards the river to hear what he had to say.\r\nAs they drew near, his looks and language excited their suspicion. But\r\nit was too late; for a number of Indians, who had hidden behind the dike\r\nduring the night, fired upon Howe across the stream, and mortally\r\nwounded him. They continued their fire on his companions, but could not\r\nprevent them from carrying the dying man to the fort. The French\r\nofficers, indignant at this villany, did not hesitate to charge it upon\r\nLe Loutre; \"for,\" says one of them, \"what is not a wicked priest capable\r\nof doing?\" But Le Loutre's brother missionary, Maillard, declares that\r\nit was purely an effect of religious zeal on the part of the Micmacs,\r\nwho, according to him, bore a deadly grudge against Howe because,\r\nfourteen years before, he had spoken words disrespectful to the Holy\r\nVirgin.[114] Maillard adds that the Indians were much pleased with what\r\nthey had done. Finding, however, that they could effect little against\r\nthe English troops, they changed their field of action, repaired to the\r\noutskirts of Halifax, murdered about thirty settlers, and carried off\r\neight or ten prisoners.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: Maillard, _Les Missions Micmaques_. On the murder of\r\nHowe, _Public Documents of Nova Scotia_, 194, 195, 210; _Mémoires sur le\r\nCanada, 1749-1760_, where it is said that Le Loutre was present at the\r\ndeed; La Vallière, _Journal_, who says that some Acadians took part in\r\nit; _Dépêches de la Jonquière_, who says \"les sauvages de l'Abbé le\r\nLoutre l'ont tué par trahison;\" and _Prévost au Ministre, 27 Oct.\r\n1750_.]\r\n\r\nStrong reinforcements came from Canada. The French began a fort on the\r\nhill of Beauséjour, and the Acadians were required to work at it with no\r\ncompensation but rations. They were thinly clad, some had neither shoes\r\nnor stockings, and winter was begun. They became so dejected that it was\r\nfound absolutely necessary to give them wages enough to supply their\r\nmost pressing needs. In the following season Fort Beauséjour was in a\r\nstate to receive a garrison. It stood on the crown of the hill, and a\r\nvast panorama stretched below and around it. In front lay the Bay of\r\nChignecto, winding along the fertile shores of Chipody and Memeramcook.\r\nFar on the right spread the great Tantemar marsh; on the left lay the\r\nmarsh of the Missaguash; and on a knoll beyond it, not three miles\r\ndistant, the red flag of England waved over the palisades of Fort\r\nLawrence, while hills wrapped in dark forests bounded the horizon.\r\n\r\nHow the homeless Acadians from Beaubassin lived through the winter is\r\nnot very clear. They probably found shelter at Chipody and its\r\nneighborhood, where there were thriving settlements of their countrymen.\r\nLe Loutre, fearing that they would return to their lands and submit to\r\nthe English, sent some of them to Isle St. Jean. \"They refused to go,\"\r\nsays a French writer; \"but he compelled them at last, by threatening to\r\nmake the Indians pillage them, carry off their wives and children, and\r\neven kill them before their eyes. Nevertheless he kept about him such as\r\nwere most submissive to his will.\"[115] In the spring after the English\r\noccupied Beaubassin, La Jonquière issued a strange proclamation. It\r\ncommanded all Acadians to take forthwith an oath of fidelity to the King\r\nof France, and to enroll themselves in the French militia, on pain of\r\nbeing treated as rebels.[116] Three years after, Lawrence, who then\r\ngoverned the province, proclaimed in his turn that all Acadians who had\r\nat any time sworn fidelity to the King of England, and who should be\r\nfound in arms against him, would be treated as criminals.[117] Thus were\r\nthese unfortunates ground between the upper and nether millstones. Le\r\nLoutre replied to this proclamation of Lawrence by a letter in which he\r\noutdid himself. He declared that any of the inhabitants who had crossed\r\nto the French side of the line, and who should presume to return to the\r\nEnglish, would be treated as enemies by his Micmacs; and in the name of\r\nthese, his Indian adherents, he demanded that the entire eastern half of\r\nthe Acadian peninsula, including the ground on which Fort Lawrence\r\nstood, should be at once made over to their sole use and sovereign\r\nownership,[118]--\"which being read and considered,\" says the record of\r\nthe Halifax Council, \"the contents appeared too insolent and absurd to\r\nbe answered.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: _Mémoires sur le Canada, 1749-1760_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: _Ordonnance du 12 Avril, 1751_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: _Écrit donné aux Habitants réfugiés à Beauséjour, 10\r\nAoût, 1754_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: _Copie de la Lettre de M. l'Abbé Le Loutre, Prêtre\r\nMissionnaire des Sauvages de l'Accadie, à M. Lawrence à Halifax, 26\r\nAoût, 1754_. There is a translation in _Public Documents of Nova\r\nScotia_.]\r\n\r\nThe number of Acadians who had crossed the line and were collected about\r\nBeauséjour was now large. Their countrymen of Chipody began to find them\r\na burden, and they lived chiefly on Government rations. Le Loutre had\r\nobtained fifty thousand livres from the Court in order to dike in, for\r\ntheir use, the fertile marshes of Memeramcook; but the relief was\r\ndistant, and the misery pressing. They complained that they had been\r\nlured over the line by false assurances, and they applied secretly to\r\nthe English authorities to learn if they would be allowed to return to\r\ntheir homes. The answer was that they might do so with full enjoyment of\r\nreligion and property, if they would take a simple oath of fidelity and\r\nloyalty to the King of Great Britain, qualified by an oral intimation\r\nthat they would not be required for the present to bear arms.[119] When\r\nLe Loutre heard this, he mounted the pulpit, broke into fierce\r\ninvectives, threatened the terrified people with excommunication, and\r\npreached himself into a state of exhaustion.[120] The military\r\ncommandant at Beauséjour used gentler means of prevention; and the\r\nAcadians, unused for generations to think or act for themselves,\r\nremained restless, but indecisive, waiting till fate should settle for\r\nthem the question, under which king?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: _Public Documents of Nova Scotia_, 205, 209.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: Compare _Mémoires, 1749-1760_, and _Public Documents of\r\nNova Scotia_, 229, 230.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, for the past three years, the commissioners appointed under\r\nthe treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle to settle the question of boundaries\r\nbetween France and England in America had been in session at Paris,\r\nwaging interminable war on paper; La Galissonière and Silhouette for\r\nFrance, Shirley and Mildmay for England. By the treaty of Utrecht,\r\nAcadia belonged to England; but what was Acadia? According to the\r\nEnglish commissioners, it comprised not only the peninsula now called\r\nNova Scotia, but all the immense tract of land between the River St.\r\nLawrence on the north, the Gulf of the same name on the east, the\r\nAtlantic on the south, and New England on the west.[121] The French\r\ncommissioners, on their part, maintained that the name Acadia belonged\r\nof right only to about a twentieth part of this territory, and that it\r\ndid not even cover the whole of the Acadian peninsula, but only its\r\nsouthern coast, with an adjoining belt of barren wilderness. When the\r\nFrench owned Acadia, they gave it boundaries as comprehensive as those\r\nclaimed for it by the English commissioners; now that it belonged to a\r\nrival, they cut it down to a paring of its former self. The denial that\r\nAcadia included the whole peninsula was dictated by the need of a winter\r\ncommunication between Quebec and Cape Breton, which was possible only\r\nwith the eastern portions in French hands. So new was this denial that\r\neven La Galissonière himself, the foremost in making it, had declared\r\nwithout reservation two years before that Acadia was the entire\r\npeninsula.[122] \"If,\" says a writer on the question, \"we had to do with\r\na nation more tractable, less grasping, and more conciliatory, it would\r\nbe well to insist also that Halifax should be given up to us.\" He thinks\r\nthat, on the whole, it would be well to make the demand in any case, in\r\norder to gain some other point by yielding this one.[123] It is curious\r\nthat while denying that the country was Acadia, the French invariably\r\ncalled the inhabitants Acadians. Innumerable public documents,\r\ncommissions, grants, treaties, edicts, signed by French kings and\r\nministers, had recognized Acadia as extending over New Brunswick and a\r\npart of Maine. Four censuses of Acadia while it belonged to the French\r\nhad recognized the mainland as included in it; and so do also the early\r\nFrench maps. Its prodigious shrinkage was simply the consequence of its\r\npossession by an alien.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: The commission of De Monts, in 1603, defines Acadia as\r\nextending from the fortieth to the forty-sixth degrees of\r\nlatitude,--that is, from central New Brunswick to southern Pennsylvania.\r\nNeither party cared to produce the document.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: \"L'Acadie suivant ses anciennes limites est la presquisle\r\nbornée par son isthme.\" _La Galissonière au Ministre, 25 Juillet, 1749_.\r\nThe English commissioners were, of course, ignorant of this admission.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: _Mémoire de l'Abbée de l'Isle-Dieu, 1753_ (1754?).]\r\n\r\nOther questions of limits, more important and equally perilous, called\r\nloudly for solution. What line should separate Canada and her western\r\ndependencies from the British colonies? Various principles of\r\ndemarcation were suggested, of which the most prominent on the French\r\nside was a geographical one. All countries watered by streams falling\r\ninto the St. Lawrence, the Great Lakes, and the Mississippi were to\r\nbelong to her. This would have planted her in the heart of New York and\r\nalong the crests of the Alleghanies, giving her all the interior of the\r\ncontinent, and leaving nothing to England but a strip of sea-coast. Yet\r\nin view of what France had achieved; of the patient gallantry of her\r\nexplorers, the zeal of her missionaries, the adventurous hardihood of\r\nher bushrangers, revealing to civilized mankind the existence of this\r\nwilderness world, while her rivals plodded at their workshops, their\r\nfarms, or their fisheries,--in view of all this, her pretensions were\r\nmoderate and reasonable compared with those of England. The treaty of\r\nUtrecht had declared the Iroquois, or Five Nations, to be British\r\nsubjects; therefore it was insisted that all countries conquered by them\r\nbelonged to the British Crown. But what was an Iroquois conquest? The\r\nIroquois rarely occupied the countries they overran. Their military\r\nexpeditions were mere raids, great or small. Sometimes, as in the case\r\nof the Hurons, they made a solitude and called it peace; again, as in\r\nthe case of the Illinois, they drove off the occupants of the soil, who\r\nreturned after the invaders were gone. But the range of their\r\nwar-parties was prodigious; and the English laid claim to every\r\nmountain, forest, or prairie where an Iroquois had taken a scalp. This\r\nwould give them not only the country between the Alleghanies and the\r\nMississippi, but also that between Lake Huron and the Ottawa, thus\r\nreducing Canada to the patch on the American map now represented by the\r\nprovince of Quebec,--or rather, by a part of it, since the extension of\r\nAcadia to the St. Lawrence would cut off the present counties of Gaspé,\r\nRimouski, and Bonaventure. Indeed among the advocates of British claims\r\nthere were those who denied that France had any rights whatever on the\r\nsouth side of the St. Lawrence.[124] Such being the attitude of the two\r\ncontestants, it was plain that there was no resort but the last argument\r\nof kings. Peace must be won with the sword.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: The extent of British claims is best shown on two maps of\r\nthe time, Mitchell's _Map of the British and French Dominions in North\r\nAmerica_ and Huske's _New and Accurate Map of North America_; both are\r\nin the British Museum. Dr. John Mitchell, in his _Contest in America_\r\n(London, 1757) pushes the English claim to its utmost extreme, and\r\ndenies that the French were rightful owners of anything in North\r\nAmerica except the town of Quebec and the trading-post of Tadoussac.\r\nBesides the claim founded on the subjection of the Iroquois to the\r\nBritish Crown, the English somewhat inconsistently advanced others\r\nfounded on titles obtained by treaty from these same tribes, and others\r\nstill, founded on the original grants of some of the colonies, which ran\r\nindefinitely westward across the continent.]\r\n\r\nThe commissioners at Paris broke up their sessions, leaving as the\r\nmonument of their toils four quarto volumes of allegations, arguments,\r\nand documentary proofs.[125] Out of the discussion rose also a swarm of\r\nfugitive publications in French, English, and Spanish; for the question\r\nof American boundaries had become European. There was one among them\r\nworth notice from its amusing absurdity. It is an elaborate\r\ndisquisition, under the title of _Roman politique_, by an author\r\nfaithful to the traditions of European diplomacy, and inspired at the\r\nsame time by the new philosophy of the school of Rousseau. He insists\r\nthat the balance of power must be preserved in America as well as in\r\nEurope, because \"Nature,\" \"the aggrandizement of the human soul,\" and\r\nthe \"felicity of man\" are unanimous in demanding it. The English\r\ncolonies are more populous and wealthy than the French; therefore the\r\nFrench should have more land, to keep the balance. Nature, the human\r\nsoul, and the felicity of man require that France should own all the\r\ncountry beyond the Alleghanies and all Acadia but a strip of the south\r\ncoast, according to the \"sublime negotiations\" of the French\r\ncommissioners, of which the writer declares himself a \"religious\r\nadmirer.\"[126]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: _Mémoires des Commissaires de Sa Majesté Très Chrétienne\r\net de ceux de Sa Majesté Brittanique_.

For extracts from French Documents, see\r\nAppendix B.]\r\n\r\nWe know already that France had used means sharper than negotiation to\r\nvindicate her claim to the interior of the continent; had marched to the\r\nsources of the Ohio to entrench herself there, and hold the passes of\r\nthe West against all comers. It remains to see how she fared in her bold\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\n1753, 1754\r\n\r\nWashington\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the end of spring the vanguard of the expedition sent by\r\nDuquesne to occupy the Ohio landed at Presquisle, where Erie now stands.\r\nThis route to the Ohio, far better than that which Céleron had followed,\r\nwas a new discovery to the French; and Duquesne calls the harbor \"the\r\nfinest in nature.\" Here they built a fort of squared chestnut logs, and\r\nwhen it was finished they cut a road of several leagues through the\r\nwoods to Rivière aux Boeufs, now French Creek. At the farther end of\r\nthis road they began another wooden fort and called it Fort Le Boeuf.\r\nThence, when the water was high, they could descend French Creek to the\r\nAllegheny, and follow that stream to the main current of the Ohio.\r\n\r\nIt was heavy work to carry the cumbrous load of baggage across the\r\nportages. Much of it is said to have been superfluous, consisting of\r\nvelvets, silks, and other useless and costly articles, sold to the King\r\nat enormous prices as necessaries of the expedition.[127] The weight of\r\nthe task fell on the Canadians, who worked with cheerful hardihood, and\r\ndid their part to admiration. Marin, commander of the expedition, a\r\ngruff, choleric old man of sixty-three, but full of force and capacity,\r\nspared himself so little that he was struck down with dysentery, and,\r\nrefusing to be sent home to Montreal, was before long in a dying state.\r\nHis place was taken by Péan, of whose private character there is little\r\ngood to be said, but whose conduct as an officer was such that Duquesne\r\ncalls him a prodigy of talents, resources, and zeal.[128] The subalterns\r\ndeserve no such praise. They disliked the service, and made no secret of\r\ntheir discontent. Rumors of it filled Montreal; and Duquesne wrote to\r\nMarin: \"I am surprised that you have not told me of this change. Take\r\nnote of the sullen and discouraged faces about you. This sort are worse\r\nthan useless. Rid yourself of them at once; send them to Montreal, that\r\nI may make an example of them.\"[129] Péan wrote at the end of September\r\nthat Marin was in extremity; and the Governor, disturbed and alarmed,\r\nfor he knew the value of the sturdy old officer, looked anxiously for a\r\nsuccessor. He chose another veteran, Legardeur de Saint-Pierre, who had\r\njust returned from a journey of exploration towards the Rocky\r\nMountains,[130] and whom Duquesne now ordered to the Ohio.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: Pouchot, _Mémoires sur la dernière Guerre de l'Amérique\r\nSeptentrionale_, I. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: _Duquesne au Ministre, 2 Nov. 1753_; compare _Mémoire\r\npour Michel-Jean Hugues Péan_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: _Duquesne à Marin, 27 Août, 1753_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: _Mémoire ou Journal sommaire du Voyage de Jacques\r\nLegardeur de Saint-Pierre._]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the effects of the expedition had already justified it. At\r\nfirst the Indians of the Ohio had shown a bold front. One of them, a\r\nchief whom the English called the Half-King, came to Fort Le Boeuf and\r\nordered the French to leave the country; but was received by Marin with\r\nsuch contemptuous haughtiness that he went home shedding tears of rage\r\nand mortification. The Western tribes were daunted. The Miamis, but\r\nyesterday fast friends of the English, made humble submission to the\r\nFrench, and offered them two English scalps to signalize their\r\nrepentance; while the Sacs, Pottawattamies, and Ojibwas were loud in\r\nprofessions of devotion.[131] Even the Iroquois, Delawares, and\r\nShawanoes on the Alleghany had come to the French camp and offered their\r\nhelp in carrying the baggage. It needed but perseverance and success in\r\nthe enterprise to win over every tribe from the mountains to the\r\nMississippi. To accomplish this and to curb the English, Duquesne had\r\nplanned a third fort, at the junction of French Creek with the\r\nAlleghany, or at some point lower down; then, leaving the three posts\r\nwell garrisoned, Péan was to descend the Ohio with the whole remaining\r\nforce, impose terror on the wavering tribes, and complete their\r\nconversion. Both plans were thwarted; the fort was not built, nor did\r\nPéan descend the Ohio. Fevers, lung diseases, and scurvy made such\r\ndeadly havoc among troops and Canadians, that the dying Marin saw with\r\nbitterness that his work must be left half done. Three hundred of the\r\nbest men were kept to garrison Forts Presquisle and Le Boeuf; and then,\r\nas winter approached, the rest were sent back to Montreal. When they\r\narrived, the Governor was shocked at their altered looks. \"I reviewed\r\nthem, and could not help being touched by the pitiable state to which\r\nfatigues and exposures had reduced them. Past all doubt, if these\r\nemaciated figures had gone down the Ohio as intended, the river would\r\nhave been strewn with corpses, and the evil-disposed savages would not\r\nhave failed to attack the survivors, seeing that they were but\r\nspectres.\"[132]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: _Rapports de Conseils avec les Sauvages à Montreal,\r\nJuillet, 1753.

The surrounding forests had dropped their\r\nleaves, and in gray and patient desolation bided the coming winter.\r\nChill rains drizzled over the gloomy \"clearing,\" and drenched the\r\npalisades and log-built barracks, raw from the axe. Buried in the\r\nwilderness, the military exiles resigned themselves as they might to\r\nmonths of monotonous solitude; when, just after sunset on the eleventh\r\nof December, a tall youth came out of the forest on horseback, attended\r\nby a companion much older and rougher than himself, and followed by\r\nseveral Indians and four or five white men with packhorses. Officers\r\nfrom the fort went out to meet the strangers; and, wading through mud\r\nand sodden snow, they entered at the gate. On the next day the young\r\nleader of the party, with the help of an interpreter, for he spoke no\r\nFrench, had an interview with the commandant, and gave him a letter from\r\nGovernor Dinwiddie. Saint-Pierre and the officer next in rank, who knew\r\na little English, took it to another room to study it at their ease; and\r\nin it, all unconsciously, they read a name destined to stand one of the\r\nnoblest in the annals of mankind; for it introduced Major George\r\nWashington, Adjutant-General of the Virginia militia.[133]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: _Journal of Major Washington. Journal of Mr. Christopher\r\nGist._]\r\n\r\nDinwiddie, jealously watchful of French aggression, had learned through\r\ntraders and Indians that a strong detachment from Canada had entered the\r\nterritories of the King of England, and built forts on Lake Erie and on\r\na branch of the Ohio. He wrote to challenge the invasion and summon the\r\ninvaders to withdraw; and he could find none so fit to bear his message\r\nas a young man of twenty-one. It was this rough Scotchman who launched\r\nWashington on his illustrious career.\r\n\r\nWashington set out for the trading station of the Ohio Company on Will's\r\nCreek; and thence, at the middle of November, struck into the wilderness\r\nwith Christopher Gist as a guide, Vanbraam, a Dutchman, as French\r\ninterpreter, Davison, a trader, as Indian interpreter, and four woodsmen\r\nas servants. They went to the forks of the Ohio, and then down the river\r\nto Logstown, the Chiningué of Céloron de Bienville. There Washington had\r\nvarious parleys with the Indians; and thence, after vexatious delays, he\r\ncontinued his journey towards Fort Le Boeuf, accompanied by the friendly\r\nchief called the Half-King and by three of his tribesmen. For several\r\ndays they followed the traders' path, pelted with unceasing rain and\r\nsnow, and came at last to the old Indian town of Venango, where French\r\nCreek enters the Alleghany. Here there was an English trading-house; but\r\nthe French had seized it, raised their flag over it, and turned it into\r\na military outpost.[134] Joncaire was in command, with two subalterns;\r\nand nothing could exceed their civility. They invited the strangers to\r\nsupper; and, says Washington, \"the wine, as they dosed themselves pretty\r\nplentifully with it, soon banished the restraint which at first appeared\r\nin their conversation, and gave a license to their tongues to reveal\r\ntheir sentiments more freely. They told me that it was their absolute\r\ndesign to take possession of the Ohio, and, by G----, they would do it;\r\nfor that although they were sensible the English could raise two men for\r\ntheir one, yet they knew their motions were too slow and dilatory to\r\nprevent any undertaking of theirs.\"[135]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: Marin had sent sixty men in August to seize the house,\r\nwhich belonged to the trader Fraser. _Dépêches de Duquesne_. They\r\ncarried off two men whom they found here. Letter of Fraser in _Colonial\r\nRecords of Pa._, V. 659.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: _Journal of Washington_, as printed at Williamsburg, just\r\nafter his return.]\r\n\r\nWith all their civility, the French officers did their best to entice\r\naway Washington's Indians; and it was with extreme difficulty that he\r\ncould persuade them to go with him. Through marshes and swamps, forests\r\nchoked with snow, and drenched with incessant rain, they toiled on for\r\nfour days more, till the wooden walls of Fort Le Boeuf appeared at last,\r\nsurrounded by fields studded thick with stumps, and half-encircled by\r\nthe chill current of French Creek, along the banks of which lay more\r\nthan two hundred canoes, ready to carry troops in the spring. Washington\r\ndescribes Legardeur de Saint-Pierre as \"an elderly gentleman with much\r\nthe air of a soldier.\" The letter sent him by Dinwiddie expressed\r\nastonishment that his troops should build forts upon lands \"so\r\nnotoriously known to be the property of the Crown of Great Britain.\" \"I\r\nmust desire you,\" continued the letter, \"to acquaint me by whose\r\nauthority and instructions you have lately marched from Canada with an\r\narmed force, and invaded the King of Great Britain's territories. It\r\nbecomes my duty to require your peaceable departure; and that you would\r\nforbear prosecuting a purpose so interruptive of the harmony and good\r\nunderstanding which His Majesty is desirous to continue and cultivate\r\nwith the Most Christian King. I persuade myself you will receive and\r\nentertain Major Washington with the candor and politeness natural to\r\nyour nation; and it will give me the greatest satisfaction if you return\r\nhim with an answer suitable to my wishes for a very long and lasting\r\npeace between us.\"\r\n\r\nSaint-Pierre took three days to frame the answer. In it he said that he\r\nshould send Dinwiddie's letter to the Marquis Duquesne and wait his\r\norders; and that meanwhile he should remain at his post, according to\r\nthe commands of his general. \"I made it my particular care,\" so the\r\nletter closed, \"to receive Mr. Washington with a distinction suitable to\r\nyour dignity as well as his own quality and great merit.\"[136] No form\r\nof courtesy had, in fact, been wanting. \"He appeared to be extremely\r\ncomplaisant,\" says Washington, \"though he was exerting every artifice to\r\nset our Indians at variance with us. I saw that every stratagem was\r\npractised to win the Half-King to their interest.\" Neither gifts nor\r\nbrandy were spared; and it was only by the utmost pains that Washington\r\ncould prevent his red allies from staying at the fort, conquered by\r\nFrench blandishments.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: \"La Distinction qui convient à votre Dignitté à sa\r\nQualité et à son grand Mérite.\" Copy of original letter sent by\r\nDinwiddie to Governor Hamilton.]\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Venango on his return, he found the horses so weak that,\r\nto arrive the sooner, he left them and their drivers in charge of\r\nVanbraam and pushed forward on foot, accompanied by Gist alone. Each was\r\nwrapped to the throat in an Indian \"matchcoat,\" with a gun in his hand\r\nand a pack at his back. Passing an old Indian hamlet called Murdering\r\nTown, they had an adventure which threatened to make good the name. A\r\nFrench Indian, whom they met in the forest, fired at them, pretending\r\nthat his gun had gone off by chance. They caught him, and Gist would\r\nhave killed him; but Washington interposed, and they let him go.[137]\r\nThen, to escape pursuit from his tribesmen, they walked all night and\r\nall the next day. This brought them to the banks of the Alleghany. They\r\nhoped to have found it dead frozen; but it was all alive and turbulent,\r\nfilled with ice sweeping down the current. They made a raft, shoved out\r\ninto the stream, and were soon caught helplessly in the drifting ice.\r\nWashington, pushing hard with his setting-pole, was jerked into the\r\nfreezing river; but caught a log of the raft, and dragged himself out.\r\nBy no efforts could they reach the farther bank, or regain that which\r\nthey had left; but they were driven against an island, where they\r\nlanded, and left the raft to its fate. The night was excessively cold,\r\nand Gist's feet and hands were badly frost-bitten. In the morning, the\r\nice had set, and the river was a solid floor. They crossed it, and\r\nsucceeded in reaching the house of the trader Fraser, on the\r\nMonongahela. It was the middle of January when Washington arrived at\r\nWilliamsburg and made his report to Dinwiddie.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: _Journal of Mr. Christopher Gist_, in _Mass. Hist. Coll.,\r\n3rd Series_, V.]\r\n\r\nRobert Dinwiddie was lieutenant-governor of Virginia, in place of the\r\ntitular governor, Lord Albermarle, whose post was a sinecure. He had\r\nbeen clerk in a government office in the West Indies; then surveyor of\r\ncustoms in the \"Old Dominion,\"--a position in which he made himself\r\ncordially disliked; and when he rose to the governorship he carried his\r\nunpopularity with him. Yet Virginia and all the British colonies owed\r\nhim much; for, though past sixty, he was the most watchful sentinel\r\nagainst French aggression and its most strenuous opponent. Scarcely had\r\nMarin's vanguard appeared at Presquisle, when Dinwiddie warned the Home\r\nGovernment of the danger, and urged, what he had before urged in vain on\r\nthe Virginian Assembly, the immediate building of forts on the Ohio.\r\nThere came in reply a letter, signed by the King, authorizing him to\r\nbuild the forts at the cost of the Colony, and to repel force by force\r\nin case he was molested or obstructed. Moreover, the King wrote, \"If you\r\nshall find that any number of persons shall presume to erect any fort or\r\nforts within the limits of our province of Virginia, you are first to\r\nrequire of them peaceably to depart; and if, notwithstanding your\r\nadmonitions, they do still endeavor to carry out any such unlawful and\r\nunjustifiable designs, we do hereby strictly charge and command you to\r\ndrive them off by force of arms.\"[138]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: _Instructions to Our Trusty and Well-beloved Robert\r\nDinwiddie, Esq., 28 Aug. 1753._]\r\n\r\nThe order was easily given; but to obey it needed men and money, and for\r\nthese Dinwiddie was dependent on his Assembly, or House of Burgesses. He\r\nconvoked them for the first of November, sending Washington at the same\r\ntime with the summons to Saint-Pierre. The burgesses met. Dinwiddie\r\nexposed the danger, and asked for means to meet it.[139] They seemed\r\nmore than willing to comply; but debates presently arose concerning the\r\nfee of a pistole, which the Governor had demanded on each patent of land\r\nissued by him. The amount was trifling, but the principle was doubtful.\r\nThe aristocratic republic of Virginia was intensely jealous of the\r\nslightest encroachment on its rights by the Crown or its representative.\r\nThe Governor defended the fee. The burgesses replied that \"subjects\r\ncannot be deprived of the least part of their property without their\r\nconsent,\" declared the fee unlawful, and called on Dinwiddie to confess\r\nit to be so. He still defended it. They saw in his demand for supplies a\r\nmeans of bringing him to terms, and refused to grant money unless he\r\nwould recede from his position. Dinwiddie rebuked them for \"disregarding\r\nthe designs of the French, and disputing the rights of the Crown\"; and\r\nhe \"prorogued them in some anger.\"[140]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: _Address of Lieutenant-Governor Dinwiddie to the Council\r\nand Burgesses, 1 Nov. 1753._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: _Dinwiddie Papers._]\r\n\r\nThus he was unable to obey the instructions of the King. As a temporary\r\nresource, he ventured to order a draft of two hundred men from the\r\nmilitia. Washington was to have command, with the trader, William Trent,\r\nas his lieutenant. His orders were to push with all speed to the forks\r\nof the Ohio, and there build a fort; \"but in case any attempts are made\r\nto obstruct the works by any persons whatsoever, to restrain all such\r\noffenders, and, in case of resistance, to make prisoners of, or kill and\r\ndestroy them.\"[141] The Governor next sent messengers to the Catawbas,\r\nCherokees, Chickasaws, and Iroquois of the Ohio, inviting them to take\r\nup the hatchet against the French, \"who, under pretence of embracing\r\nyou, mean to squeeze you to death.\" Then he wrote urgent letters to the\r\ngovernors of Pennsylvania, the Carolinas, Maryland, and New Jersey,\r\nbegging for contingents of men, to be at Wills Creeks in March at the\r\nlatest. But nothing could be done without money; and trusting for a\r\nchange of heart on the part of the burgesses, he summoned them to meet\r\nagain on the fourteenth of February. \"If they come in good temper,\" he\r\nwrote to Lord Fairfax, a nobleman settled in the colony, \"I hope they\r\nwill lay a fund to qualify me to send four or five hundred men more to\r\nthe Ohio, which, with the assistance of our neighboring colonies, may\r\nmake some figure.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 141: _Ibid. Instructions to Major George Washington, January,\r\n1754._]\r\n\r\nThe session began. Again, somewhat oddly, yet forcibly, the Governor set\r\nbefore the Assembly the peril of the situation, and begged them to\r\npostpone less pressing questions to the exigency of the hour.[142] This\r\ntime they listened; and voted ten thousand pounds in Virginia currency\r\nto defend the frontier. The grant was frugal, and they jealously placed\r\nits expenditure in the hands of a committee of their own.[143]\r\nDinwiddie, writing to the Lords of Trade, pleads necessity as his excuse\r\nfor submitting to their terms. \"I am sorry,\" he says, \"to find them too\r\nmuch in a republican way of thinking.\" What vexed him still more was\r\ntheir sending an agent to England to complain against him on the\r\nirrepressible question of the pistole fee; and he writes to his London\r\nfriend, the merchant Hanbury: \"I have had a great deal of trouble from\r\nthe factious disputes and violent heats of a most impudent, troublesome\r\nparty here in regard to that silly fee of a pistole. Surely every\r\nthinking man will make a distinction between a fee and a tax. Poor\r\npeople! I pity their ignorance and narrow, ill-natured spirits. But, my\r\nfriend, consider that I could by no means give up this fee without\r\naffronting the Board of Trade and the Council here who established it.\"\r\nHis thoughts were not all of this harassing nature, and he ends his\r\nletter with the following petition: \"Now, sir, as His Majesty is pleased\r\nto make me a military officer, please send for Scott, my tailor, to make\r\nme a proper suit of regimentals, to be here by His Majesty's birthday. I\r\ndo not much like gayety in dress, but I conceive this necessary. I do\r\nnot much care for lace on the coat, but a neat embroidered button-hole;\r\nthough you do not deal that way, I know you have a good taste, that I\r\nmay show my friend's fancy in that suit of clothes; a good laced hat and\r\ntwo pair stockings, one silk, the other fine thread.\"[144]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: _Speech of Lieutenant-Governor Dinwiddie to the Council\r\nand Burgesses 14 Feb., 1754._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: See the bill in Hening, _Statutes of Virginia_, VI. 417.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: _Dinwiddie to Hanbury, 12 March, 1754; Ibid., 10 May,\r\n1754._]\r\n\r\nIf the Governor and his English sometimes provoke a smile, he deserves\r\nadmiration for the energy with which he opposed the public enemy, under\r\ncircumstances the most discouraging. He invited the Indians to meet him\r\nin council at Winchester, and, as bait to attract them, coupled the\r\nmessage with a promise of gifts. He sent circulars from the King to the\r\nneighboring governors, calling for supplies, and wrote letter upon\r\nletter to rouse them to effort. He wrote also to the more distant\r\ngovernors, Delancey of New York, and Shirley of Massachusetts, begging\r\nthem to make what he called a \"faint\" against Canada, to prevent the\r\nFrench from sending so large a force to the Ohio. It was to the nearer\r\ncolonies, from New Jersey to South Carolina, that he looked for direct\r\naid; and their several governors were all more or less active to procure\r\nit; but as most of them had some standing dispute with their assemblies,\r\nthey could get nothing except on terms with which they would not, and\r\nsometimes could not, comply. As the lands invaded by the French belonged\r\nto one of the two rival claimants, Virginia and Pennsylvania, the other\r\ncolonies had no mind to vote money to defend them. Pennsylvania herself\r\nrefused to move. Hamilton, her governor, could do nothing against the\r\nplacid obstinacy of the Quaker non-combatants and the stolid obstinacy\r\nof the German farmers who chiefly made up his Assembly. North Carolina\r\nalone answered the appeal, and gave money enough to raise three or four\r\nhundred men. Two independent companies maintained by the King in New\r\nYork, and one in South Carolina, had received orders from England to\r\nmarch to the scene of action; and in these, with the scanty levies of\r\nhis own and the adjacent province, lay Dinwiddie's only hope. With men\r\nabundant and willing, there were no means to put them into the field,\r\nand no commander whom they would all obey.\r\n\r\nFrom the brick house at Williamsburg pompously called the Governor's\r\nPalace, Dinwiddie despatched letters, orders, couriers, to hasten the\r\ntardy reinforcements of North Carolina and New York, and push on the raw\r\nsoldiers of the Old Dominion, who now numbered three hundred men. They\r\nwere called the Virginia regiment; and Joshua Fry, an English gentleman,\r\nbred at Oxford, was made their colonel, with Washington as next in\r\ncommand. Fry was at Alexandria with half the so-called regiment, trying\r\nto get it into marching order; Washington, with the other half, had\r\npushed forward to the Ohio Company's storehouse at Wills Creek, which\r\nwas to form a base of operations. His men were poor whites, brave, but\r\nhard to discipline; without tents, ill armed, and ragged as Falstaff's\r\nrecruits. Besides these, a band of backwoodsmen under Captain Trent had\r\ncrossed the mountains in February to build a fort at the forks of the\r\nOhio, where Pittsburg now stands,--a spot which Washington had examined\r\nwhen on his way to Fort Le Boeuf, and which he had reported as the best\r\nfor the purpose. The hope was that Trent would fortify himself before\r\nthe arrival of the French, and that Washington and Fry would join him in\r\ntime to secure the position. Trent had begun the fort; but for some\r\nunexplained reason had gone back to Wills Creek leaving Ensign Ward with\r\nforty men at work upon it. Their labors were suddenly interrupted. On\r\nthe seventeenth of April a swarm of bateaux and canoes came down the\r\nAlleghany, bringing, according to Ward, more than a thousand Frenchmen,\r\nthough in reality not much above five hundred, who landed, planted\r\ncannon against the incipient stockade, and summoned the ensign to\r\nsurrender, on pain of what might ensue.[145] He complied, and was\r\nallowed to depart with his men. Retracing his steps over the mountains,\r\nhe reported his mishap to Washington; while the French demolished his\r\nunfinished fort, began a much larger and better one, and named it Fort\r\nDuquesne.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: See the summons in _Précis des Faits_, 101.]\r\n\r\nThey had acted with their usual promptness. Their Governor, a practised\r\nsoldier, knew the value of celerity, and had set his troops in motion\r\nwith the first opening of spring. He had no refractory assembly to\r\nhamper him; no lack of money, for the King supplied it; and all Canada\r\nmust march at his bidding. Thus, while Dinwiddie was still toiling to\r\nmuster his raw recruits, Duquesne's lieutenant, Contrecoeur, successor\r\nof Saint-Pierre, had landed at Presquisle with a much greater force, in\r\npart regulars, and in part Canadians.\r\n\r\nDinwiddie was deeply vexed when a message from Washington told him how\r\nhis plans were blighted; and he spoke his mind to his friend Hanbury:\r\n\"If our Assembly had voted the money in November which they did in\r\nFebruary, it's more than probable the fort would have been built and\r\ngarrisoned before the French had approached; but these things cannot be\r\ndone without money. As there was none in our treasury, I have advanced\r\nmy own to forward the expedition; and if the independent companies from\r\nNew York come soon, I am in hopes the eyes of the other colonies will be\r\nopened; and if they grant a proper supply of men, I hope we shall be\r\nable to dislodge the French or build a fort on that river. I\r\ncongratulate you on the increase of your family. My wife and two girls\r\njoin in our most sincere respects to good Mrs. Hanbury.\"[146]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: _Dinwiddie to Hanbury, 10 May, 1754._]\r\n\r\nThe seizure of a king's fort by planting cannon against it and\r\nthreatening it with destruction was in his eyes a beginning of\r\nhostilities on the part of the French; and henceforth both he and\r\nWashington acted much as if war had been declared. From their station at\r\nWills Creek, the distance by the traders' path to Fort Duquesne was\r\nabout a hundred and forty miles. Midway was a branch of the Monongahela\r\ncalled Redstone Creek, at the mouth of which the Ohio Company had built\r\nanother storehouse. Dinwiddie ordered all the forces to cross the\r\nmountains and assemble at this point, until they should be strong enough\r\nto advance against the French. The movement was critical in presence of\r\nan enemy as superior in discipline as he was in numbers, while the\r\nnatural obstacles were great. A road for cannon and wagons must be cut\r\nthrough a dense forest and over two ranges of high mountains, besides\r\ncountless hills and streams. Washington set all his force to the work,\r\nand they spent a fortnight in making twenty miles. Towards the end of\r\nMay, however, Dinwiddie learned that he had crossed the main ridge of\r\nthe Alleghanies, and was encamped with a hundred and fifty men near the\r\nparallel ridge of Laurel Hill, at a place called the Great Meadows.\r\nTrent's backwoodsmen had gone off in disgust; Fry, with the rest of the\r\nregiment, was still far behind; and Washington was daily expecting an\r\nattack. Close upon this, a piece of good news, or what seemed such, came\r\nover the mountains and gladdened the heart of the Governor. He heard\r\nthat a French detachment had tried to surprise Washington, and that he\r\nhad killed or captured the whole. The facts were as follows.\r\n\r\nWashington was on the Youghiogany, a branch of the Monongahela,\r\nexploring it in hopes that it might prove navigable, when a messenger\r\ncame to him from his old comrade, the Half-King, who was on the way to\r\njoin him. The message was to the effect that the French had marched from\r\ntheir fort, and meant to attack the first English they should meet. A\r\nreport came soon after that they were already at the ford of the\r\nYoughiogany, eighteen miles distant. Washington at once repaired to the\r\nGreat Meadows, a level tract of grass and bushes, bordered by wooded\r\nhills, and traversed in one part by a gully, which with a little labor\r\nthe men turned into an entrenchment, at the same time cutting away the\r\nbushes and clearing what the young commander called \"a charming field\r\nfor an encounter.\" Parties were sent out to scour the woods, but they\r\nfound no enemy. Two days passed; when, on the morning of the\r\ntwenty-seventh, Christopher Gist, who had lately made a settlement on\r\nthe farther side of Laurel Hill, twelve or thirteen miles distant, came\r\nto the camp with news that fifty Frenchmen had been at his house towards\r\nnoon of the day before, and would have destroyed everything but for the\r\nintervention of two Indians whom he had left in charge during his\r\nabsence. Washington sent seventy-five men to look for the party; but the\r\nsearch was vain, the French having hidden themselves so well as to\r\nescape any eye but that of an Indian. In the evening a runner came from\r\nthe Half-King, who was encamped with a few warriors some miles distant.\r\nHe had sent to tell Washington that he had found the tracks of two men,\r\nand traced them towards a dark glen in the forest, where in his belief\r\nall the French were lurking.\r\n\r\nWashington seems not to have hesitated a moment. Fearing a stratagem to\r\nsurprise his camp, he left his main force to guard it, and at ten\r\no'clock set out for the Half-King's wigwams at the head of forty men.\r\nThe night was rainy, and the forest, to use his own words, \"as black as\r\npitch.\" \"The path,\" he continues, \"was hardly wide enough for one man;\r\nwe often lost it, and could not find it again for fifteen or twenty\r\nminutes, and we often tumbled over each other in the dark[147].\" Seven\r\nof his men were lost in the woods and left behind. The rest groped their\r\nway all night, and reached the Indian camp at sunrise. A council was\r\nheld with the Half-King, and he and his warriors agreed to join in\r\nstriking the French. Two of them led the way. The tracks of the two\r\nFrench scouts seen the day before were again found, and, marching in\r\nsingle file, the party pushed through the forest into the rocky hollow\r\nwhere the French were supposed to be concealed. They were there in fact;\r\nand they snatched their guns the moment they saw the English. Washington\r\ngave the word to fire. A short fight ensued. Coulon de Jumonville, an\r\nensign in command, was killed, with nine others; twenty-two were\r\ncaptured, and none escaped but a Canadian who had fled at the beginning\r\nof the fray. After it was over, the prisoners told Washington that the\r\nparty had been sent to bring him a summons from Contrecoeur, the\r\ncommandant at Fort Duquesne.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: _Journal of Washington_ in _Précis des Faits_, 109. This\r\nJournal, which is entirely distinct from that before cited, was found by\r\nthe French among the baggage left on the field after the defeat of\r\nBraddock in 1755, and a translation of it was printed by them as above.\r\nThe original has disappeared.]\r\n\r\nFive days before, Contrecoeur had sent Jumonville to scour the country\r\nas far as the dividing ridge of the Alleghanies. Under him were another\r\nofficer, three cadets, a volunteer, an interpreter, and twenty-eight\r\nmen. He was provided with a written summons, to be delivered to any\r\nEnglish he might find. It required them to withdraw from the domain of\r\nthe King of France, and threatened compulsion by force of arms in case\r\nof refusal. But before delivering the summons Jumonville was ordered to\r\nsend two couriers back with all speed to Fort Duquesne to inform the\r\ncommandant that he had found the English, and to acquaint him when he\r\nintended to communicate with them.[148] It is difficult to imagine any\r\nobject for such an order except that of enabling Contrecoeur to send to\r\nthe spot whatever force might be needed to attack the English on their\r\nrefusal to withdraw. Jumonville had sent the two couriers, and had\r\nhidden himself, apparently to wait the result. He lurked nearly two days\r\nwithin five miles of Washington's camp, sent out scouts to reconnoitre\r\nit, but gave no notice of his presence; played to perfection the part of\r\na skulking enemy, and brought destruction on himself by conduct which\r\ncan only be ascribed to a sinister motive on the one hand, or to extreme\r\nfolly on the other. French deserters told Washington that the party came\r\nas spies, and were to show the summons only if threatened by a superior\r\nforce. This last assertion is confirmed by the French officer Pouchot,\r\nwho says that Jumonville, seeing himself the weaker party, tried to show\r\nthe letter he had brought.[149]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: The summons and the instructions to Jumonville are in\r\n_Précis des Faits_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: Pouchot, _Mémoire sur la dernière Guerre_.]\r\n\r\nFrench writers say that, on first seeing the English, Jumonville's\r\ninterpreter called out that he had something to say to them; but\r\nWashington, who was at the head of his men, affirms this to be\r\nabsolutely false. The French say further that Jumonville was killed in\r\nthe act of reading the summons. This is also denied by Washington, and\r\nrests only on the assertion of the Canadian who ran off at the outset,\r\nand on the alleged assertion of Indians who, if present at all, which is\r\nunlikely, escaped like the Canadian before the fray began. Druillon, an\r\nofficer with Jumonville, wrote two letters to Dinwiddie after his\r\ncapture, to claim the privileges of the bearer of a summons; but while\r\nbringing forward every other circumstance in favor of the claim, he does\r\nnot pretend that the summons was read or shown either before or during\r\nthe action. The French account of the conduct of Washington's Indians is\r\nno less erroneous. \"This murder,\" says a chronicler of the time,\r\n\"produced on the minds of the savages an effect very different from that\r\nwhich the cruel Washington had promised himself. They have a horror of\r\ncrime; and they were so indignant at that which had just been\r\nperpetrated before their eyes, that they abandoned him, and offered\r\nthemselves to us in order to take vengeance.\"[150] Instead of doing\r\nthis, they boasted of their part in the fight, scalped all the dead\r\nFrenchmen, sent one scalp to the Delawares as an invitation to take up\r\nthe hatchet for the English, and distributed the rest among the various\r\nOhio tribes to the same end.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 150: Poulin de Lumina, _Histoire de la Guerre contre les\r\nAnglois_, 15.]\r\n\r\nCoolness of judgment, a profound sense of public duty, and a strong\r\nself-control, were even then the characteristics of Washington; but he\r\nwas scarcely twenty-two, was full of military ardor, and was vehement\r\nand fiery by nature. Yet it is far from certain that, even when age and\r\nexperience had ripened him, he would have forborne to act as he did, for\r\nthere was every reason for believing that the designs of the French were\r\nhostile; and though by passively waiting the event he would have thrown\r\nupon them the responsibility of striking the first blow, he would have\r\nexposed his small party to capture or destruction by giving them time to\r\ngain reinforcements from Fort Duquesne. It was inevitable that the\r\nkilling of Jumonville should be greeted in France by an outcry of real\r\nor assumed horror; but the Chevalier de Lévis, second in command to\r\nMontcalm, probably expresses the true opinion of Frenchmen best fitted\r\nto judge when he calls it \"a pretended assassination.\"[151] Judge it as\r\nwe may, this obscure skirmish began the war that set the world on\r\nfire.[152]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: Lévis, _Mémoire sur la Guerre du Canada_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: On this affair, Sparks, _Writings of Washington_, II.\r\n25-48, 447. _Dinwiddie Papers.

Gaspé,\r\n_Anciens Canadiens, appendix_, 396. The assertion of Abbé de\r\nl'Isle-Dieu, that Jumonville showed a flag of truce, is unsupported.\r\nAdam Stephen, who was in the fight, says that the guns of the English\r\nwere so wet that they had to trust mainly to the bayonet. The Half-King\r\nboasted that he killed Jumonville with his tomahawk. Dinwiddie highly\r\napproved Washington's conduct.\r\n\r\nIn 1755 the widow of Jumonville received a pension of one hundred and\r\nfifty francs. In 1775 his daughter, Charlotte Aimable, wishing to become\r\na nun, was given by the King six hundred francs for her \"trousseau\" on\r\nentering the convent. _Dossier de Jumonville et de sa Veuve, 22 Mars,\r\n1755_. _Mémoire pour Mlle. de Jumonville, 10 Juillet, 1775_. _Résponse\r\ndu Garde des Sceaux, 25 Juillet, 1775_.]\r\n\r\nWashington returned to the camp at the Great Meadows; and, expecting\r\nsoon to be attacked, sent for reinforcements to Colonel Fry, who was\r\nlying dangerously ill at Wills Creek. Then he set his men to work at an\r\nentrenchment, which he named Fort Necessity, and which must have been of\r\nthe slightest, as they finished it within three days.[153] The Half-King\r\nnow joined him, along with the female potentate known as Queen\r\nAlequippa, and some thirty Indian families. A few days after, Gist came\r\nfrom Wills Creek with news that Fry was dead. Washington succeeded to\r\nthe command of the regiment, the remaining three companies of which\r\npresently appeared and joined their comrades, raising the whole number\r\nto three hundred. Next arrived the independent company from South\r\nCarolina; and the Great Meadows became an animated scene, with the\r\nwigwams of the Indians, the camp-sheds of the rough Virginians, the\r\ncattle grazing on the tall grass or drinking at the lazy brook that\r\ntraversed it; the surrounding heights and forests; and over all, four\r\nmiles away the lofty green ridge of Laurel Hill.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 153: _Journal of Washington_ in _Précis des Faits_.]\r\n\r\nThe presence of the company of regulars was a doubtful advantage.\r\nCaptain Mackay, its commander, holding his commission from the King,\r\nthought himself above any officer commissioned by the Governor. There\r\nwas great courtesy between him and Washington; but Mackay would take no\r\norders, nor even the countersign, from the colonel of volunteers. Nor\r\nwould his men work, except for an additional shilling a day. To give\r\nthis was impossible, both from want of money, and from the discontent it\r\nwould have bred in the Virginians, who worked for nothing besides their\r\ndaily pay of eightpence. Washington, already a leader of men, possessed\r\nhimself in a patience extremely difficult to his passionate temper; but\r\nthe position was untenable, and the presence of the military drones\r\ndemoralized his soldiers. Therefore, leaving Mackay at the Meadows, he\r\nadvanced towards Gist's settlement, cutting a wagon road as he went.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the settlement the camp was formed and an entrenchment\r\nthrown up. Deserters had brought news that strong reinforcements were\r\nexpected at Fort Duquesne, and friendly Indians repeatedly warned\r\nWashington that he would soon be attacked by overwhelming numbers. Forty\r\nIndians from the Ohio came to the camp, and several days were spent in\r\ncouncils with them; but they proved for the most part to be spies of the\r\nFrench. The Half-King stood fast by the English, and sent out three of\r\nhis young warriors as scouts. Reports of attack thickened. Mackay and\r\nhis men were sent for, and they arrived on the twenty-eighth of June. A\r\ncouncil of war was held at Gist's house; and as the camp was commanded\r\nby neighboring heights, it was resolved to fall back. The horses were so\r\nfew that the Virginians had to carry much of the baggage on their backs,\r\nand drag nine swivels over the broken and rocky road. The regulars,\r\nthough they also were raised in the provinces, refused to give the\r\nslightest help. Toiling on for two days, they reached the Great Meadows\r\non the first of July. The position, though perhaps the best in the\r\nneighborhood, was very unfavorable, and Washington would have retreated\r\nfarther, but for the condition of his men. They were spent with fatigue,\r\nand there was no choice but to stay and fight.\r\n\r\nStrong reinforcements had been sent to Fort Duquesne in the spring, and\r\nthe garrison now consisted of about fourteen hundred men. When news of\r\nthe death of Jumonville reached Montreal, Coulon de Villiers, brother of\r\nthe slain officer, was sent to the spot with a body of Indians from all\r\nthe tribes in the colony. He made such speed that at eight o'clock on\r\nthe morning of the twenty-sixth of June he reached the fort with his\r\nmotley following. Here he found that five hundred Frenchmen and a few\r\nOhio Indians were on the point of marching against the English, under\r\nChevalier Le Mercier; but in view of his seniority in rank and his\r\nrelationship to Jumonville, the command was now transferred to Villiers.\r\nHereupon, the march was postponed; the newly-arrived warriors were\r\ncalled to council, and Contrecoeur thus harangued them: \"The English\r\nhave murdered my children, my heart is sick; to-morrow I shall send my\r\nFrench soldiers to take revenge. And now, men of the Saut St. Louis, men\r\nof the Lake of Two Mountains, Hurons, Abenakis, Iroquois of La\r\nPrésentation, Nipissings, Algonquins, and Ottawas,--I invite you all by\r\nthis belt of wampum to join your French father and help him to crush the\r\nassassins. Take this hatchet, and with it two barrels of wine for a\r\nfeast.\" Both hatchet and wine were cheerfully accepted. Then Contrecoeur\r\nturned to the Delawares, who were also present: \"By these four strings\r\nof wampum I invite you, if you are true children of Onontio, to follow\r\nthe example of your brethren;\" and with some hesitation they also took\r\nup the hatchet.\r\n\r\nThe next day was spent by the Indians in making moccasons for the march,\r\nand by the French in preparing for an expedition on a larger scale than\r\nhad been at first intended. Contrecoeur, Villiers, Le Mercier, and\r\nLongueuil, after deliberating together, drew up a paper to the effect\r\nthat \"it was fitting (_convenable_) to march against the English with\r\nthe greatest possible number of French and savages, in order to avenge\r\nourselves and chastise them for having violated the most sacred laws of\r\ncivilized nations;\" that, thought their conduct justified the French in\r\ndisregarding the existing treaty of peace, yet, after thoroughly\r\npunishing them, and compelling them to withdraw from the domain of the\r\nKing, they should be told that, in pursuance of his royal orders, the\r\nFrench looked on them as friends. But it was further agreed that should\r\nthe English have withdrawn to their own side of the mountains, \"they\r\nshould be followed to their settlements to destroy them and treat them\r\nas enemies, till that nation should give ample satisfaction and\r\ncompletely change its conduct.\"[154]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 154: _Journal de Campagne de M. de Villiers depuis son Arrivée\r\nau Fort Duquesne jusqu'à son Retour au dit Fort_. These and other\r\npassages are omitted in the Journal as printed in _Précis des Faits_.\r\nBefore me is a copy from the original in the Archives de la Marine.]\r\n\r\nThe party set out on the next morning, paddled their canoes up the\r\nMonongahela, encamped, heard Mass; and on the thirtieth reached the\r\ndeserted storehouse of the Ohio Company at the mouth of Redstone Creek.\r\nIt was a building of solid logs, well loopholed for musketry. To please\r\nthe Indians by asking their advice, Villiers called all the chiefs to\r\ncouncil; which, being concluded to their satisfaction, he left a\r\nsergeant's guard at the storehouse to watch the canoes, and began his\r\nmarch through the forest. The path was so rough that at the first halt\r\nthe chaplain declared he could go no farther, and turned back for the\r\nstorehouse, though not till he had absolved the whole company in a body.\r\nThus lightened of their sins, they journeyed on, constantly sending out\r\nscouts. On the second of July they reached the abandoned camp of\r\nWashington at Gist's settlement; and here they bivouacked, tired, and\r\ndrenched all night by rain. At daybreak they marched again, and passed\r\nthrough the gorge of Laurel Hill. It rained without ceasing; but\r\nVilliers pushed his way through the dripping forest to see the place,\r\nhalf a mile from the road, where his brother had been killed, and where\r\nseveral bodies still lay unburied. They had learned from a deserter the\r\nposition of the enemy, and Villiers filled the woods in front with a\r\nswarm of Indian scouts. The crisis was near. He formed his men in\r\ncolumn, and ordered every officer to his place.\r\n\r\nWashington's men had had a full day at Fort Necessity; but they spent it\r\nless in resting from their fatigue than in strengthening their rampart\r\nwith logs. The fort was a simple square enclosure, with a trench said by\r\na French writer to be only knee deep. On the south, and partly on the\r\nwest, there was an exterior embankment, which seems to have been made,\r\nlike a rifle-pit, with the ditch inside. The Virginians had but little\r\nammunition, and no bread whatever, living chiefly on fresh beef. They\r\nknew the approach of the French, who were reported to Washington as nine\r\nhundred strong, besides Indians. Towards eleven o'clock a wounded\r\nsentinel came in with news that they were close at hand; and they\r\npresently appeared at the edge of the woods, yelling, and firing from\r\nsuch a distance that their shot fell harmless. Washington drew up his\r\nmen on the meadow before the fort, thinking, he says, that the enemy,\r\nbeing greatly superior in force, would attack at once; and choosing for\r\nsome reason to meet them on the open plain. But Villiers had other\r\nviews. \"We approached the English,\" he writes, \"as near as possible,\r\nwithout uselessly exposing the lives of the King's subjects;\" and he and\r\nhis followers made their way through the forest till they came opposite\r\nthe fort, where they stationed themselves on two densely wooded hills,\r\nadjacent, though separated by a small brook. One of these was about a\r\nhundred paces from the English, and the other about sixty. Their\r\nposition was such that the French and Indians, well sheltered by trees\r\nand bushes, and with the advantage of higher ground, could cross their\r\nfire upon the fort and enfilade a part of it. Washington had meanwhile\r\ndrawn his followers within the entrenchment; and the firing now began on\r\nboth sides. Rain fell all day. The raw earth of the embankment was\r\nturned to soft mud, and the men in the ditch of the outwork stood to the\r\nknee in water. The swivels brought back from the camp at Gist's farm\r\nwere mounted on the rampart; but the gunners were so ill protected that\r\nthe pieces were almost silenced by the French musketry. The fight lasted\r\nnine hours. At times the fire on both sides was nearly quenched by the\r\nshowers, and the bedrenched combatants could do little but gaze at each\r\nother through a gray veil of mist and rain. Towards night, however, the\r\nfusillade revived, and became sharp again until dark. At eight o'clock\r\nthe French called out to propose a parley.\r\n\r\nVilliers thus gives his reason for these overtures. \"As we had been wet\r\nall day by the rain, as the soldiers were very tired, as the savages\r\nsaid that they would leave us the next morning, and as there was a\r\nreport that drums and the firing of cannon had been heard in the\r\ndistance, I proposed to M. Le Mercier to offer the English a\r\nconference.\" He says further that ammunition was falling short, and that\r\nhe thought the enemy might sally in a body and attack him.[155] The\r\nEnglish, on their side, were in a worse plight. They were half starved,\r\ntheir powder was nearly spent, their guns were foul, and among them all\r\nthey had but two screw-rods to clean them. In spite of his desperate\r\nposition, Washington declined the parley, thinking it a pretext to\r\nintroduce a spy; but when the French repeated their proposal and\r\nrequested that he would send an officer to them, he could hesitate no\r\nlonger. There were but two men with him who knew French, Ensign\r\nPeyroney, who was disabled by a wound, and the Dutchman, Captain\r\nVanbraam. To him the unpalatable errand was assigned. After a long\r\nabsence he returned with articles of capitulation offered by Villiers;\r\nand while the officers gathered about him in the rain, he read and\r\ninterpreted the paper by the glimmer of a sputtering candle kept alight\r\nwith difficulty. Objection was made to some of the terms, and they were\r\nchanged. Vanbraam, however, apparently anxious to get the capitulation\r\nsigned and the affair ended, mistranslated several passages, and\r\nrendered the words _l'assassinat du Sieur de Jumonville_ as _the death\r\nof the Sieur de Jumonville_.[156] As thus understood, the articles were\r\nsigned about midnight. They provided that the English should march out\r\nwith drums beating and the honors of war, carrying with them one of\r\ntheir swivels and all their other property; that they should be\r\nprotected against insult from French or Indians; that the prisoners\r\ntaken in the affair of Jumonville should be set free; and that two\r\nofficers should remain as hostages for their safe return to Fort\r\nDuquesne. The hostages chosen were Vanbraam and a brave but eccentric\r\nScotchman, Robert Stobo, an acquaintance of the novelist Smollett, said\r\nto be the original of his Lismahago.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 155: _Journal de Villiers_, original. Omitted in the Journal\r\nas printed by the French Government. A short and very incorrect abstract\r\nof this Journal will be found in _N.Y. Col. Docs._, X.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 156: See Appendix C. On the fight at Great Meadows, compare\r\nSparks, _Writings of Washington_, II. 456-468; also a letter of Colonel\r\nInnes to Governor Hamilton, written a week after the event, in _Colonial\r\nRecords of Pa._, VI. 50, and a letter of Adam Stephen in _Pennsylvania\r\nGazette, 1754_.]\r\n\r\nWashington reports that twelve of the Virginians were killed on the\r\nspot, and forty-three wounded, while on the casualties in Mackay's\r\ncompany no returns appear. Villiers reports his own loss at only twenty\r\nin all.[157] The numbers engaged are uncertain. The six companies of the\r\nVirginia regiment counted three hundred and five men and officers, and\r\nMackay's company one hundred; but many were on the sick list, and some\r\nhad deserted. About three hundred and fifty may have taken part in the\r\nfight. On the side of the French, Villiers says that the detachment as\r\noriginally formed consisted of five hundred white men. These were\r\nincreased after his arrival at Fort Duquesne, and one of the party\r\nreports that seven hundred marched on the expedition.[158] The number of\r\nIndians joining them is not given; but as nine tribes and communities\r\ncontributed to it, and as two barrels of wine were required to give the\r\nwarriors a parting feast, it must have been considerable. White men and\r\nred, it seems clear that the French force was more than twice that of\r\nthe English, while they were better posted and better sheltered, keeping\r\nall day under cover, and never showing themselves on the open meadow.\r\nThere were no Indians with Washington. Even the Half-King held aloof;\r\nthough, being of a caustic turn, he did not spare his comments on the\r\nfight, telling Conrad Weiser, the provincial interpreter, that the\r\nFrench behaved like cowards, and the English like fools.[159]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 157: Dinwiddie writes to the Lords of Trade that thirty in all\r\nwere killed, and seventy wounded, on the English side; and the\r\ncommissary Varin writes to Bigot that the French lost seventy-two\r\nkilled and wounded.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 158: _A Journal had from Thomas Forbes, lately a Private\r\nSoldier in the King of France's Service_. (Public Record Office.) Forbes\r\nwas one of Villiers' soldiers. The commissary Varin puts the number of\r\nFrench at six hundred, besides Indians.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: _Journal of Conrad Weiser_, in _Colonial Records of Pa._,\r\nVI. 150. The Half-King also remarked that Washington \"was a good-natured\r\nman, but had no experience, and would by no means take advice from the\r\nIndians, but was always driving them on to fight by his directions; that\r\nhe lay at one place from one full moon to the other, and made no\r\nfortifications at all, except that little thing upon the meadow, where\r\nhe thought the French would come up to him in open field.\"]\r\n\r\nIn the early morning the fort was abandoned and the retreat began. The\r\nIndians had killed all the horses and cattle, and Washington's men were\r\nso burdened with the sick and wounded, whom they were obliged to carry\r\non their backs, that most of the baggage was perforce left behind. Even\r\nthen they could march but a few miles, and then encamped to wait for\r\nwagons. The Indians increased the confusion by plundering, and\r\nthreatening an attack. They knocked to pieces the medicine-chest, thus\r\ncausing great distress to the wounded, two of whom they murdered and\r\nscalped. For a time there was danger of panic; but order was restored,\r\nand the wretched march began along the forest road that led over the\r\nAlleghanies, fifty-two miles to the station at Wills Creek. Whatever may\r\nhave been the feelings of Washington, he has left no record of them. His\r\nimmense fortitude was doomed to severer trials in the future; yet\r\nperhaps this miserable morning was the darkest of his life. He was\r\ndeeply moved by sights of suffering; and all around him were wounded men\r\nborne along in torture, and weary men staggering under the living load.\r\nHis pride was humbled, and his young ambition seemed blasted in the bud.\r\nIt was the fourth of July. He could not foresee that he was to make that\r\nday forever glorious to a new-born nation hailing him as its father.\r\n\r\nThe defeat at Fort Necessity was doubly disastrous to the English, since\r\nit was a new step and a long one towards the ruin of their interest with\r\nthe Indians; and when, in the next year, the smouldering war broke into\r\nflame, nearly all the western tribes drew their scalping-knives for\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nVilliers went back exultant to Fort Duquesne, burning on his way the\r\nbuildings of Gist's settlement and the storehouse at Redstone Creek. Not\r\nan English flag now waved beyond the Alleghanies.[160]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: See Appendix C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\n1754, 1755\r\n\r\nThe Signal of Battle\r\n\r\n\r\nThe defeat of Washington was a heavy blow to the Governor, and he\r\nangrily ascribed it to the delay of the expected reinforcements. The\r\nKing's companies from New York had reached Alexandria, and crawled\r\ntowards the scene of action with thin ranks, bad discipline, thirty\r\nwomen and children, no tents, no blankets, no knapsacks, and for\r\nmunitions one barrel of spoiled gunpowder.[161] The case was still worse\r\nwith the regiment from North Carolina. It was commanded by Colonel\r\nInnes, a countryman and friend of Dinwiddie, who wrote to him: \"Dear\r\nJames, I now wish that we had none from your colony but yourself, for I\r\nforesee nothing but confusion among them.\" The men were, in fact,\r\nutterly unmanageable. They had been promised three shillings a day,\r\nwhile the Virginians had only eightpence; and when they heard on the\r\nmarch that their pay was to be reduced, they mutinied, disbanded, and\r\nwent home.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: _Dinwiddie to the Lords of Trade, 24 July, 1754. Ibid. to\r\nDelancey, 20 June, 1754._]\r\n\r\n\"You may easily guess,\" says Dinwiddie to a London correspondent, \"the\r\ngreat fatigue and trouble I have had, which is more than I ever went\r\nthrough in my life.\" He rested his hopes on the session of his Assembly,\r\nwhich was to take place in August; for he thought that the late disaster\r\nwould move them to give him money for defending the colony. These\r\nmeetings of the burgesses were the great social as well as political\r\nevent of the Old Dominion, and gave a gathering signal to the Virginian\r\ngentry scattered far and wide on their lonely plantations. The capital\r\nof the province was Williamsburg, a village of about a thousand\r\ninhabitants, traversed by a straight and very wide street, and adorned\r\nwith various public buildings, conspicuous among which was William and\r\nMary College, a respectable structure, unjustly likened by Jefferson to\r\na brick kiln with a roof. The capitol, at the other end of the town, had\r\nbeen burned some years before, and had just risen from its ashes. Not\r\nfar distant was the so-called Governor's Palace, where Dinwiddie with\r\nhis wife and two daughters exercised such official hospitality as his\r\nmoderate salary and Scottish thrift would permit.[162]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: For a contemporary account of Williamsburg, Burnaby,\r\n_Travels in North America_, 6. Smyth, _Tour in America_, I. 17,\r\ndescribes it some years later.]\r\n\r\nIn these seasons of festivity the dull and quiet village was\r\ntransfigured. The broad, sandy street, scorching under a southern sun,\r\nwas thronged with coaches and chariots brought over from London at heavy\r\ncost in tobacco, though soon to be bedimmed by Virginia roads and negro\r\ncare; racing and hard-drinking planters; clergymen of the Establishment,\r\nnot much more ascetic than their boon companions of the laity; ladies,\r\nwith manners a little rusted by long seclusion; black coachmen and\r\nfootmen, proud of their masters and their liveries; young cavaliers,\r\nbooted and spurred, sitting their thoroughbreds with the careless grace\r\nof men whose home was the saddle. It was a proud little provincial\r\nsociety, which might seem absurd in its lofty self-appreciation, had it\r\nnot soon approved itself so prolific in ability and worth.[163]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: The English traveller Smyth, in his _Tour_, gives a\r\ncurious and vivid picture of Virginian life. For the social condition of\r\nthis and other colonies before the Revolution, one cannot do better than\r\nto consult Lodge's _Short History of the English Colonies_.]\r\n\r\nThe burgesses met, and Dinwiddie made them an opening speech, inveighing\r\nagainst the aggressions of the French, their \"contempt of treaties,\" and\r\n\"ambitious views for universal monarchy;\" and he concluded: \"I could\r\nexpatiate very largely on these affairs, but my heart burns with\r\nresentment at their insolence. I think there is no room for many\r\narguments to induce you to raise a considerable supply to enable me to\r\ndefeat the designs of these troublesome people and enemies of mankind.\"\r\nThe burgesses in their turn expressed the \"highest and most becoming\r\nresentment,\" and promptly voted twenty thousand pounds; but on the third\r\nreading of the bill they added to it a rider which touched the old\r\nquestion of the pistole fee, and which, in the view of the Governor, was\r\nboth unconstitutional and offensive. He remonstrated in vain; the\r\nstubborn republicans would not yield, nor would he; and again he\r\nprorogued them. This unexpected defeat depressed him greatly. \"A\r\ngovernor,\" he wrote, \"is really to be pitied in the discharge of his\r\nduty to his king and country, in having to do with such obstinate,\r\nself-conceited people.... I cannot satisfy the burgesses unless I\r\nprostitute the rules of government. I have gone through monstrous\r\nfatigues. Such wrong-headed people, I thank God, I never had to do with\r\nbefore.\"[164] A few weeks later he was comforted; for, having again\r\ncalled the burgesses, they gave him the money, without trying this time\r\nto humiliate him.[165]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 164: _Dinwiddie to Hamilton, 6 Sept., 1754. Ibid. to J.\r\nAbercrombie, 1 Sept., 1754._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 165: Hening, VI. 435.]\r\n\r\nIn straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel, aristocratic Virginia was\r\nfar outdone by democratic Pennsylvania. Hamilton, her governor, had laid\r\nbefore the Assembly a circular letter from the Earl of Holdernesse\r\ndirecting him, in common with other governors, to call on his province\r\nfor means to repel any invasion which might be made \"within the\r\nundoubted limits of His Majesty's dominion.\"[166] The Assembly of\r\nPennsylvania was curiously unlike that of Virginia, as half and often\r\nmore than half of its members were Quaker tradesmen in sober raiment and\r\nbroad-brimmed hats; while of the rest, the greater part were Germans who\r\ncared little whether they lived under English rule or French, provided\r\nthat they were left in peace upon their farms. The House replied to the\r\nGovernor's call: \"It would be highly presumptuous in us to pretend to\r\njudge of the undoubted limits of His Majesty's dominions;\" and they\r\nadded: \"the Assemblies of this province are generally composed of a\r\nmajority who are constitutionally principled against war, and represent\r\na well-meaning, peaceable people.\"[167] They then adjourned, telling the\r\nGovernor that, \"As those our limits have not been clearly ascertained to\r\nour satisfaction, we fear the precipitate call upon us as the province\r\ninvaded cannot answer any good purpose at this time.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 166: _The Earl of Holdernesse to the Governors in America, 28\r\nAug. 1753._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 167: _Colonial Records of Pa._, V. 748.]\r\n\r\nIn the next month they met again, and again Hamilton asked for means to\r\ndefend the country. The question was put, Should the Assembly give money\r\nfor the King's use? and the vote was feebly affirmative. Should the sum\r\nbe twenty thousand pounds? The vote was overwhelming in the negative.\r\nFifteen thousand, ten thousand, and five thousand, were successively\r\nproposed, and the answer was always, No. The House would give nothing\r\nbut five hundred pounds for a present to the Indians; after which they\r\nadjourned \"to the sixth of the month called May.\"[168] At their next\r\nmeeting they voted to give the Governor ten thousand pounds; but under\r\nconditions which made them for some time independent of his veto, and\r\nwhich, in other respects, were contrary to his instructions from the\r\nKing, as well as from the proprietaries of the province, to whom he had\r\ngiven bonds to secure his obedience. He therefore rejected the bill, and\r\nthey adjourned. In August they passed a similar vote, with the same\r\nresult. At their October meeting they evaded his call for supplies. In\r\nDecember they voted twenty thousand pounds, hampered with conditions\r\nwhich were sure to be refused, since Morris, the new governor, who had\r\nlately succeeded Hamilton, was under the same restrictions as his\r\npredecessor. They told him, however, that in the present case they felt\r\nthemselves bound by no Act of Parliament, and added: \"We hope the\r\nGovernor, notwithstanding any penal bond he may have entered into, will\r\non reflection think himself at liberty and find it consistent with his\r\nsafety and honor to give his assent to this bill.\" Morris, who had taken\r\nthe highest legal advice on the subject in England, declined to\r\ncompromise himself, saying: \"Consider, gentlemen, in what light you will\r\nappear to His Majesty while, instead of contributing towards your own\r\ndefence, you are entering into an ill-timed controversy concerning the\r\nvalidity of royal instructions which may be delayed to a more convenient\r\ntime without the least injury to the rights of the people.\"[169] They\r\nwould not yield, and told him \"that they had rather the French should\r\nconquer them than give up their privileges.\"[170] \"Truly,\" remarks\r\nDinwiddie, \"I think they have given their senses a long holiday.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: _Pennsylvania Archives_, II. 235. _Colonial Records of\r\nPa._, VI. 22-26. _Works of Franklin,_ III. 265.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 169: _Colonial Records of Pa._, VI. 215.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 170: _Morris to Penn, 1 Jan. 1755._]\r\n\r\nNew York was not much behind her sisters in contentious stubbornness. In\r\nanswer to the Governor's appeal, the Assembly replied: \"It appears that\r\nthe French have built a fort at a place called French Creek, at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the River Ohio, which may, but does not by\r\nany evidence or information appear to us to be an invasion of any of His\r\nMajesty's colonies.\"[171] So blind were they as yet to \"manifest\r\ndestiny!\" Afterwards, however, on learning the defeat of Washington,\r\nthey gave five thousand pounds to aid Virginia.[172] Maryland, after\r\nlong delay, gave six thousand. New Jersey felt herself safe behind the\r\nother colonies, and would give nothing. New England, on the other hand,\r\nand especially Massachusetts, had suffered so much from French\r\nwar-parties that they were always ready to fight. Shirley, the governor\r\nof Massachusetts, had returned from his bootless errand to settle the\r\nboundary question at Paris. His leanings were strongly monarchical; yet\r\nhe believed in the New Englanders, and was more or less in sympathy with\r\nthem. Both he and they were strenuous against the French, and they had\r\nmutually helped each other to reap laurels in the last war. Shirley was\r\ncautious of giving umbrage to his Assembly, and rarely quarrelled with\r\nit, except when the amount of his salary was in question. He was not\r\naverse to a war with France; for though bred a lawyer, and now past\r\nmiddle life, he flattered himself with hopes of a high military command.\r\nOn the present occasion, making use of a rumor that the French were\r\nseizing the carrying-place between the Chaudière and the Kennebec, he\r\ndrew from the Assembly a large grant of money, and induced them to call\r\nupon him to march in person to the scene of danger. He accordingly\r\nrepaired to Falmouth (now Portland); and, though the rumor proved false,\r\nsent eight hundred men under Captain John Winslow to build two forts on\r\nthe Kennebec as a measure of precaution.[173]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 171: _Address of the Assembly to Lieutenant-Governor Delancey,\r\n23 April, 1754. Lords of Trade to Delancey, 5 July, 1754_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: _Delancey to Lords of Trade, 8 Oct. 1754_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 173: _Massachusetts Archives, 1754_. Hutchinson, III. 26.\r\n_Conduct of Major-General Shirley briefly stated. Journals of the Board\r\nof Trade, 1754_.]\r\n\r\nWhile to these northern provinces Canada was an old and pestilent enemy,\r\nthose towards the south scarcely knew her by name; and the idea of\r\nFrench aggression on their borders was so novel and strange that they\r\nadmitted it with difficulty. Mind and heart were engrossed in strife\r\nwith their governors: the universal struggle for virtual self-rule. But\r\nthe war was often waged with a passionate stupidity. The colonist was\r\nnot then an American; he was simply a provincial, and a narrow one. The\r\ntime was yet distant when these dissevered and jealous communities\r\nshould weld themselves into one broad nationality, capable, at need, of\r\nthe mightiest efforts to purge itself of disaffection and vindicate its\r\ncommanding unity.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of that practical independence which they had so much at\r\nheart, two conditions were essential to the colonists. The one was a\r\nfield for expansion, and the other was mutual help. Their first\r\nnecessity was to rid themselves of the French, who, by shutting them\r\nbetween the Alleghanies and the sea, would cramp them into perpetual\r\nlittleness. With France on their backs, growing while they had no room\r\nto grow, they must remain in helpless wardship, dependent on England,\r\nwhose aid they would always need; but with the West open before them,\r\ntheir future was their own. King and Parliament would respect perforce\r\nthe will of a people spread from the ocean to the Mississippi, and\r\nunited in action as in aims. But in the middle of the last century the\r\nvision of the ordinary colonist rarely reached so far. The immediate\r\nvictory over a governor, however slight the point at issue, was more\r\nprecious in his eyes than the remote though decisive advantage which he\r\nsaw but dimly.\r\n\r\nThe governors, representing the central power, saw the situation from\r\nthe national point of view. Several of them, notably Dinwiddie and\r\nShirley, were filled with wrath at the proceedings of the French; and\r\nthe former was exasperated beyond measure at the supineness of the\r\nprovinces. He had spared no effort to rouse them, and had failed. His\r\ninstincts were on the side of authority; but, under the circumstances,\r\nit is hardly to be imputed to him as a very deep offence against human\r\nliberty that he advised the compelling of the colonies to raise men and\r\nmoney for their own defence, and proposed, in view of their \"intolerable\r\nobstinacy and disobedience to his Majesty's commands,\" that Parliament\r\nshould tax them half-a-crown a head. The approaching war offered to the\r\nparty of authority temptations from which the colonies might have saved\r\nit by opening their purse-strings without waiting to be told.\r\n\r\nThe Home Government, on its part, was but half-hearted in the wish that\r\nthey should unite in opposition to the common enemy. It was very willing\r\nthat the several provinces should give money and men, but not that they\r\nshould acquire military habits and a dangerous capacity of acting\r\ntogether. There was one kind of union, however, so obviously necessary,\r\nand at the same time so little to be dreaded, that the British Cabinet,\r\ninstructed by the governors, not only assented to it, but urged it. This\r\nwas joint action in making treaties with the Indians. The practice of\r\nseparate treaties, made by each province in its own interest, had bred\r\nendless disorders. The adhesion of all the tribes had been so shaken,\r\nand the efforts of the French to alienate them were so vigorous and\r\neffective, that not a moment was to be lost. Joncaire had gained over\r\nmost of the Senecas, Piquet was drawing the Onondagas more and more to\r\nhis mission, and the Dutch of Albany were alienating their best friends,\r\nthe Mohawks, by encroaching on their lands. Their chief, Hendrick, came\r\nto New York with a deputation of the tribe to complain of their wrongs;\r\nand finding no redress, went off in anger, declaring that the covenant\r\nchain was broken.[174] The authorities in alarm called William Johnson\r\nto their aid. He succeeded in soothing the exasperated chief, and then\r\nproceeded to the confederate council at Onondaga, where he found the\r\nassembled sachems full of anxieties and doubts. \"We don't know what you\r\nChristians, English and French, intend,\" said one of their orators. \"We\r\nare so hemmed in by you both that we have hardly a hunting-place left.\r\nIn a little while, if we find a bear in a tree, there will immediately\r\nappear an owner of the land to claim the property and hinder us from\r\nkilling it, by which we live. We are so perplexed between you that we\r\nhardly know what to say or think.\"[175] No man had such power over the\r\nFive Nations as Johnson. His dealings with them were at once honest,\r\ndownright, and sympathetic. They loved and trusted him as much as they\r\ndetested the Indian commissioners at Albany, whom the province of New\r\nYork had charged with their affairs, and who, being traders, grossly\r\nabused their office.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: _N.Y. Col. Docs._, VI. 788. _Colonial Records of Pa._ V.\r\n625.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 175: _N.Y. Col. Docs._, VI. 813.]\r\n\r\nIt was to remedy this perilous state of things that the Lords of Trade\r\nand Plantations directed the several governors to urge on their\r\nassemblies the sending of commissioners to make a joint treaty with the\r\nwavering tribes.[176] Seven of the provinces, New York, Pennsylvania,\r\nMaryland, and the four New England colonies, acceded to the plan, and\r\nsent to Albany, the appointed place of meeting, a body of men who for\r\ncharacter and ability had never had an equal on the continent, but whose\r\npowers from their respective assemblies were so cautiously limited as to\r\npreclude decisive action. They met in the court-house of the little\r\nfrontier city. A large \"chain-belt\" of wampum was provided, on which the\r\nKing was symbolically represented, holding in his embrace the colonies,\r\nthe Five Nations, and all their allied tribes. This was presented to the\r\nassembled warriors, with a speech in which the misdeeds of the French\r\nwere not forgotten. The chief, Hendrick, made a much better speech in\r\nreply. \"We do now solemnly renew and brighten the covenant chain. We\r\nshall take the chain-belt to Onondaga, where our council-fire always\r\nburns, and keep it so safe that neither thunder nor lightning shall\r\nbreak it.\" The commissioners had blamed them for allowing so many of\r\ntheir people to be drawn away to Piquet's mission. \"It is true,\" said\r\nthe orator, \"that we live disunited. We have tried to bring back our\r\nbrethren, but in vain; for the Governor of Canada is like a wicked,\r\ndeluding spirit. You ask why we are so dispersed. The reason is that you\r\nhave neglected us for these three years past.\" Here he took a stick and\r\nthrew it behind him. \"You have thus thrown us behind your back; whereas\r\nthe French are a subtle and vigilant people, always using their utmost\r\nendeavors to seduce and bring us over to them.\" He then told them that\r\nit was not the French alone who invaded the country of the Indians. \"The\r\nGovernor of Virginia and the Governor of Canada are quarrelling about\r\nlands which belong to us, and their quarrel may end in our destruction.\"\r\nAnd he closed with a burst of sarcasm. \"We would have taken Crown Point\r\n[_in the last war_], but you prevented us. Instead, you burned your own\r\nfort at Saratoga and ran away from it,--which was a shame and a scandal\r\nto you. Look about your country and see: you have no fortifications; no,\r\nnot even in this city. It is but a step from Canada hither, and the\r\nFrench may come and turn you out of doors. You desire us to speak from\r\nthe bottom of our hearts, and we shall do it. Look at the French: they\r\nare men; they are fortifying everywhere. But you are all like women,\r\nbare and open, without fortifications.\"[177]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 176: _Circular Letter of Lords of Trade to Governors in\r\nAmerica, 18 Sept. 1753. Lords of Trade to Sir Danvers Osborne, in N.Y.\r\nCol. Docs._, VI. 800.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 177: _Proceedings of the Congress at Albany, N.Y. Col. Docs._,\r\nVI. 853. A few verbal changes, for the sake of brevity, are made in the\r\nabove extracts.]\r\n\r\nHendrick's brother Abraham now took up the word, and begged that Johnson\r\nmight be restored to the management of Indian affairs, which he had\r\nformerly held; \"for,\" said the chief, \"we love him and he us and he has\r\nalways been our good and trusty friend.\" The commissioners had not power\r\nto grant the request, but the Indians were assured that it should not be\r\nforgotten; and they returned to their villages soothed, but far from\r\nsatisfied. Nor were the commissioners empowered to take any effective\r\nsteps for fortifying the frontier.\r\n\r\nThe congress now occupied itself with another matter. Its members were\r\nagreed that great danger was impending; that without wise and just\r\ntreatment of the tribes, the French would gain them all, build forts\r\nalong the back of the British colonies, and, by means of ships and\r\ntroops from France, master them one by one, unless they would combine\r\nfor mutual defence. The necessity of some form of union had at length\r\nbegun to force itself upon the colonial mind. A rough woodcut had lately\r\nappeared in the _Pennsylvania Gazette_, figuring the provinces under the\r\nnot very flattering image of a snake cut to pieces, with the motto,\r\n\"Join, or die.\" A writer of the day held up the Five Nations for\r\nemulation, observing that if ignorant savages could confederate, British\r\ncolonists might do as much.[178] Franklin, the leading spirit of the\r\ncongress, now laid before it his famous project of union, which has been\r\ntoo often described to need much notice here. Its fate is well known.\r\nThe Crown rejected it because it gave too much power to the colonies;\r\nthe colonies, because it gave too much power to the Crown, and because\r\nit required each of them to transfer some of its functions of\r\nself-government to a central council. Another plan was afterwards\r\ndevised by the friends of prerogative, perfectly agreeable to the King,\r\nsince it placed all power in the hands of a council of governors, and\r\nsince it involved compulsory taxation of the colonists, who, for the\r\nsame reasons, would have doggedly resisted it, had an attempt been made\r\nto carry it into effect.[179]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 178: Kennedy, _Importance of gaining and preserving the\r\nFriendship of the Indians_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 179: On the Albany plan of union, _Franklin's Works_, I. 177.\r\nShirley thought it \"a great strain upon the prerogative of the Crown,\"\r\nand was for requiring the colonies to raise money and men \"without\r\nfarther consulting them upon any points whatever.\" _Shirley to Robinson,\r\n24 Dec. 1754_.]\r\n\r\nEven if some plan of union had been agreed upon, long delay must have\r\nfollowed before its machinery could be set in motion; and meantime there\r\nwas need of immediate action. War-parties of Indians from Canada, set\r\non, it was thought, by the Governor, were already burning and murdering\r\namong the border settlements of New York and New Hampshire. In the south\r\nDinwiddie grew more and more alarmed, \"for the French are like so many\r\nlocusts; they are collected in bodies in a most surprising manner; their\r\nnumber now on the Ohio is from twelve hundred to fifteen hundred.\" He\r\nwrites to Lord Granville that, in his opinion, they aim to conquer the\r\ncontinent, and that \"the obstinacy of this stubborn generation\" exposes\r\nthe country \"to the merciless rage of a rapacious enemy.\" What vexed him\r\neven more than the apathy of the assemblies was the conduct of his\r\nbrother-governor, Glen of South Carolina, who, apparently piqued at the\r\nconspicuous part Dinwiddie was acting, wrote to him in a \"very\r\ndictatorial style,\" found fault with his measures, jested at his\r\nactivity in writing letters, and even questioned the right of England to\r\nlands on the Ohio; till he was moved at last to retort: \"I cannot help\r\nobserving that your letters and arguments would have been more proper\r\nfrom a French officer than from one of His Majesty's governors. My\r\nconduct has met with His Majesty's gracious approbation; and I am sorry\r\nit has not received yours.\" Thus discouraged, even in quarters where he\r\nhad least reason to expect it, he turned all his hopes to the Home\r\nGovernment; again recommended a tax by Act of Parliament, and begged, in\r\nrepeated letters, for arms, munitions, and two regiments of\r\ninfantry.[180] His petition was not made in vain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 180: _Dinwiddie Papers_; letters to Granville, Albemarle,\r\nHalifax, Fox, Holdernesse, Horace Walpole, and Lords of Trade.]\r\n\r\nEngland at this time presented the phenomenon of a prime minister who\r\ncould not command the respect of his own servants. A more preposterous\r\nfigure than the Duke of Newcastle never stood at the head of a great\r\nnation. He had a feverish craving for place and power, joined to a total\r\nunfitness for both. He was an adept in personal politics, and was so\r\nbusied with the arts of winning and keeping office that he had no\r\nleisure, even if he had had ability, for the higher work of government.\r\nHe was restless, quick in movement, rapid and confused in speech, lavish\r\nof worthless promises, always in a hurry, and at once headlong, timid,\r\nand rash. \"A borrowed importance and real insignificance,\" says Walpole,\r\nwho knew him well, \"gave him the perpetual air of a solicitor.... He had\r\nno pride, though infinite self-love. He loved business immoderately; yet\r\nwas only always doing it, never did it. When left to himself, he always\r\nplunged into difficulties, and then shuddered for the consequences.\"\r\nWalpole gives an anecdote showing the state of his ideas on colonial\r\nmatters. General Ligonier suggested to him that Annapolis ought to be\r\ndefended. \"To which he replied with his lisping, evasive hurry:\r\n'Annapolis, Annapolis! Oh, yes, Annapolis must be defended,--where is\r\nAnnapolis?'\"[181] Another contemporary, Smollett, ridicules him in his\r\nnovel of _Humphrey Clinker_, and tells a similar story, which, founded\r\nin fact or not, shows in what estimation the minister was held: \"Captain\r\nC. treated the Duke's character without any ceremony. 'This wiseacre,'\r\nsaid he, 'is still abed; and I think the best thing he can do is to\r\nsleep on till Christmas; for when he gets up he does nothing but expose\r\nhis own folly. In the beginning of the war he told me in a great fright\r\nthat thirty thousand French had marched from Acadia to Cape Breton.\r\nWhere did they find transports? said I.--Transports! cried he, I tell\r\nyou they marched by land.--By land to the island of Cape Breton!--What,\r\nis Cape Breton an island?--Certainly.--Ha! are you sure of that?--When I\r\npointed it out on the map, he examined it earnestly with his spectacles;\r\nthen, taking me in his arms,--My dear C., cried he, you always bring us\r\ngood news. Egad! I'll go directly and tell the King that Cape Breton is\r\nan island.'\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 181: Walpole, _George II._, I. 344.]\r\n\r\nHis wealth, county influence, flagitious use of patronage, and\r\nlong-practised skill in keeping majorities in the House of Commons by\r\nmeans that would not bear the light, made his support necessary to Pitt\r\nhimself, and placed a fantastic political jobber at the helm of England\r\nin a time when she needed a patriot and a statesman. Newcastle was the\r\ngrowth of the decrepitude and decay of a great party, which had\r\nfulfilled its mission and done its work. But if the Whig soil had become\r\npoor for a wholesome crop, it was never so rich for toadstools.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Robinson held the Southern Department, charged with the\r\ncolonies; and Lord Mahon remarks of him that the Duke had achieved the\r\nfeat of finding a secretary of state more incapable than himself. He had\r\nthe lead of the House of Commons. \"Sir Thomas Robinson lead us!\" said\r\nPitt to Henry Fox; \"the Duke might as well send his jackboot to lead\r\nus.\" The active and aspiring Halifax was at the head of the Board of\r\nTrade and Plantations. The Duke of Cumberland commanded the army,--an\r\nindifferent soldier, though a brave one; harsh, violent, and headlong.\r\nAnson, the celebrated navigator, was First Lord of the Admiralty,--a\r\nposition in which he disappointed everybody.\r\n\r\nIn France the true ruler was Madame de Pompadour, once the King's\r\nmistress, now his procuress, and a sort of feminine prime minister.\r\nMachault d'Arnouville was at the head of the Marine and Colonial\r\nDepartment. The diplomatic representatives of the two Crowns were more\r\nconspicuous for social than for political talents. Of Mirepoix, French\r\nambassador at London, Marshal Saxe had once observed: \"It is a good\r\nappointment; he can teach the English to dance.\" Walpole says concerning\r\nhim: \"He could not even learn to pronounce the names of our games of\r\ncards,--which, however, engaged most of the hours of his negotiation. We\r\nwere to be bullied out of our colonies by an apprentice at whist!\" Lord\r\nAlbemarle, English ambassador at Versailles, is held up by Chesterfield\r\nas an example to encourage his son in the pursuit of the graces: \"What\r\ndo you think made our friend Lord Albemarle colonel of a regiment of\r\nGuards, Governor of Virginia, Groom of the Stole, and ambassador to\r\nParis,--amounting in all to sixteen or seventeen thousand pounds a year?\r\nWas it his birth? No; a Dutch gentleman only. Was it his estate? No; he\r\nhad none. Was it his learning, his parts, his political abilities and\r\napplication? You can answer these questions as easily and as soon as I\r\ncan ask them. What was it then? Many people wondered; but I do not, for\r\nI know, and will tell you,--it was his air, his address, his manners,\r\nand his graces.\"\r\n\r\nThe rival nations differed widely in military and naval strength.\r\nEngland had afloat more than two hundred ships of war, some of them of\r\ngreat force; while the navy of France counted little more than half the\r\nnumber. On the other hand, England had reduced her army to eighteen\r\nthousand men, and France had nearly ten times as many under arms. Both\r\nalike were weak in leadership. That rare son of the tempest, a great\r\ncommander, was to be found in neither of them since the death of Saxe.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the approaching crisis, the interests of the two Powers\r\npointed to opposite courses of action. What France needed was time. It\r\nwas her policy to put off a rupture, wreathe her face in diplomatic\r\nsmiles, and pose in an attitude of peace and good faith, while\r\nincreasing her navy, reinforcing her garrisons in America, and\r\nstrengthening her positions there. It was the policy of England to\r\nattack at once, and tear up the young encroachments while they were yet\r\nin the sap, before they could strike root and harden into stiff\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the fourteenth of November, the King made his opening speech to\r\nthe Houses of Parliament, he congratulated them on the prevailing peace,\r\nand assured them that he should improve it to promote the trade of his\r\nsubjects, \"and protect those possessions which constitute one great\r\nsource of their wealth.\" America was not mentioned; but his hearers\r\nunderstood him, and made a liberal grant for the service of the\r\nyear.[182] Two regiments, each of five hundred men, had already been\r\nordered to sail for Virginia, where their numbers were to be raised by\r\nenlistment to seven hundred.[183] Major-General Braddock, a man after\r\nthe Duke of Cumberland's own heart, was appointed to the chief command.\r\nThe two regiments--the forty-fourth and the forty-eighth--embarked at\r\nCork in the middle of January. The soldiers detested the service, and\r\nmany had deserted. More would have done so had they foreseen what\r\nawaited them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 182: Entick, _Late War_, I. 118.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 183: _Robinson to Lords of the Admiralty, 30 Sept. 1754.\r\nIbid., to Board of Ordnance, 10 Oct. 1754. Ibid., Circular Letter to\r\nAmerican Governors, 26 Oct. 1754. Instructions to our Trusty and\r\nWell-beloved Edward Braddock, 25 Nov. 1754_.]\r\n\r\nThis movement was no sooner known at Versailles than a counter\r\nexpedition was prepared on a larger scale. Eighteen ships of war were\r\nfitted for sea at Brest and Rochefort, and the six battalions of La\r\nReine, Bourgogne, Languedoc, Guienne, Artois, and Béarn, three thousand\r\nmen in all, were ordered on board for Canada. Baron Dieskau, a German\r\nveteran who had served under Saxe, was made their general; and with him\r\nwent the new governor of French America, the Marquis de Vaudreuil,\r\ndestined to succeed Duquesne, whose health was failing under the\r\nfatigues of his office. Admiral Dubois de la Motte commanded the fleet;\r\nand lest the English should try to intercept it, another squadron of\r\nnine ships, under Admiral Macnamara, was ordered to accompany it to a\r\ncertain distance from the coast. There was long and tedious delay.\r\nDoreil, commissary of war, who had embarked with Vaudreuil and Dieskau\r\nin the same ship, wrote from the harbor of Brest on the twenty-ninth of\r\nApril: \"At last I think we are off. We should have been outside by four\r\no'clock this morning, if M. de Macnamara had not been obliged to ask\r\nCount Dubois de la Motte to wait till noon to mend some important part\r\nof the rigging (I don't know the name of it) which was broken. It is\r\nprecious time lost, and gives the English the advantage over us of two\r\ntides. I talk of these things as a blind man does of colors. What is\r\ncertain is that Count Dubois de la Motte is very impatient to get away,\r\nand that the King's fleet destined for Canada is in very able and\r\nzealous hands. It is now half-past two. In half an hour all may be\r\nready, and we may get out of the harbor before night.\" He was again\r\ndisappointed; it was the third of May before the fleet put to sea.[184]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 184: _Lettres de Cremille, de Rostaing, et de Doreil au\r\nMinistre, Avril 18, 24, 28, 29, 1755.

Pouchot, I. 25.]\r\n\r\nDuring these preparations there was active diplomatic correspondence\r\nbetween the two Courts. Mirepoix demanded why British troops were sent\r\nto America. Sir Thomas Robinson answered that there was no intention to\r\ndisturb the peace or offend any Power whatever; yet the secret orders to\r\nBraddock were the reverse of pacific. Robinson asked on his part the\r\npurpose of the French armament at Brest and Rochefort; and the answer,\r\nlike his own, was a protestation that no hostility was meant. At the\r\nsame time Mirepoix in the name of the King proposed that orders should\r\nbe given to the American governors on both sides to refrain from all\r\nacts of aggression. But while making this proposal the French Court\r\nsecretly sent orders to Duquesne to attack and destroy Fort Halifax, one\r\nof the two forts lately built by Shirley on the Kennebec,--a river\r\nwhich, by the admission of the French themselves, belonged to the\r\nEnglish. But, in making this attack, the French Governor was expressly\r\nenjoined to pretend that he acted without orders.[185] He was also told\r\nthat, if necessary, he might make use of the Indians to harass the\r\nEnglish.[186] Thus there was good faith on neither part; but it is clear\r\nthrough all the correspondence that the English expected to gain by\r\nprecipitating an open rupture, and the French by postponing it. Projects\r\nof convention were proposed on both sides, but there was no agreement.\r\nThe English insisted as a preliminary condition that the French should\r\nevacuate all the western country as far as the Wabash. Then ensued a\r\nlong discussion of their respective claims, as futile as the former\r\ndiscussion at Paris on Acadian boundaries.[187]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 185: _Machault à Duquesne, 17 Fév. 1755_. The letter of\r\nMirepoix proposing mutual abstinence from aggression, is dated on the\r\n6th of the same month. The French dreaded Fort Halifax, because they\r\nthought it prepared the way for an advance on Quebec by way of the\r\nChaudière.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 186: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 187: This correspondence is printed among the _Pièces\r\njustificatives_ of the _Précis des Faits_.]\r\n\r\nThe British Court knew perfectly the naval and military preparations of\r\nthe French. Lord Albemarle had died at Paris in December; but the\r\nsecretary of the embassy, De Cosne, sent to London full information\r\nconcerning the fleet at Brest and Rochefort.[188] On this, Admiral\r\nBoscawen, with eleven ships of the line and one frigate, was ordered to\r\nintercept it; and as his force was plainly too small, Admiral Melbourne,\r\nwith seven more ships, was sent, nearly three weeks after, to join him\r\nif he could. Their orders were similar,--to capture or destroy any\r\nFrench vessels bound to North America.[189] Boscawen, who got to sea\r\nbefore La Motte, stationed himself near the southern coast of\r\nNewfoundland to cut him off; but most of the French squadron eluded him,\r\nand safely made their way, some to Louisbourg, and the others to Quebec.\r\nThus the English expedition was, in the main, a failure. Three of the\r\nFrench ships, however, lost in fog and rain, had become separated from\r\nthe rest, and lay rolling and tossing on an angry sea not far from Cape\r\nRace. One of them was the \"Alcide,\" commanded by Captain Hocquart; the\r\nothers were the \"Lis\" and the \"Dauphin.\" The wind fell; but the fogs\r\ncontinued at intervals; till, on the afternoon of the seventh of June,\r\nthe weather having cleared, the watchman on the maintop saw the distant\r\nocean studded with ships. It was the fleet of Boscawen. Hocquart, who\r\ngives the account, says that in the morning they were within three\r\nleagues of him, crowding all sail in pursuit. Towards eleven o'clock one\r\nof them, the \"Dunkirk,\" was abreast of him to windward, within short\r\nspeaking distance; and the ship of the Admiral, displaying a red flag as\r\na signal to engage, was not far off. Hocquart called out: \"Are we at\r\npeace, or war?\" He declares that Howe, captain of the \"Dunkirk,\" replied\r\nin French: \"La paix, la paix.\" Hocquart then asked the name of the\r\nBritish admiral; and on hearing it said: \"I know him; he is a friend of\r\nmine.\" Being asked his own name in return, he had scarcely uttered it\r\nwhen the batteries of the \"Dunkirk\" belched flame and smoke, and\r\nvolleyed a tempest of iron upon the crowded decks of the \"Alcide.\" She\r\nreturned the fire, but was forced at length to strike her colors.\r\nRostaing, second in command of the troops, was killed; and six other\r\nofficers, with about eighty men, were killed or wounded.[190] At the\r\nsame time the \"Lis\" was attacked and overpowered. She had on board eight\r\ncompanies of the battalions of La Reine and Languedoc. The third French\r\nship, the \"Dauphin,\" escaped under cover of a rising fog.[191]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 188: Particulars in Entick, I. 121.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 189: _Secret Instructions for our Trusty and Well-beloved\r\nEdward Boscawen, Esq., Vice-Admiral of the Blue, 16 April, 1755.

The sword was drawn and\r\nbrandished in the eyes of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\n1755\r\n\r\nBraddock\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have the pleasure to acquaint you that General Braddock came to my\r\nhouse last Sunday night,\" writes Dinwiddie, at the end of February, to\r\nGovernor Dobbs of North Carolina. Braddock had landed at Hampton from\r\nthe ship \"Centurion,\" along with young Commodore Keppel, who commanded\r\nthe American squadron. \"I am mighty glad,\" again writes Dinwiddie, \"that\r\nthe General is arrived, which I hope will give me some ease; for these\r\ntwelve months past I have been a perfect slave.\" He conceived golden\r\nopinions of his guest. \"He is, I think, a very fine officer, and a\r\nsensible, considerate gentleman. He and I live in great harmony.\"\r\n\r\nHad he known him better, he might have praised him less. William\r\nShirley, son of the Governor of Massachusetts, was Braddock's secretary;\r\nand after an acquaintance of some months wrote to his friend Governor\r\nMorris: \"We have a general most judiciously chosen for being\r\ndisqualified for the service he is employed in in almost every respect.\r\nHe may be brave for aught I know, and he is honest in pecuniary\r\nmatters.\"[192] The astute Franklin, who also had good opportunity of\r\nknowing him, says: \"This general was, I think, a brave man, and might\r\nprobably have made a good figure in some European war. But he had too\r\nmuch self-confidence; too high an opinion of the validity of regular\r\ntroops; too mean a one of both Americans and Indians.\"[193] Horace\r\nWalpole, in his function of gathering and immortalizing the gossip of\r\nhis time, has left a sharply drawn sketch of Braddock in two letters to\r\nSir Horace Mann, written in the summer of this year: \"I love to give you\r\nan idea of our characters as they rise upon the stage of history.\r\nBraddock is a very Iroquois in disposition. He had a sister who, having\r\ngamed away all her little fortune at Bath, hanged herself with a truly\r\nEnglish deliberation, leaving only a note upon the table with those\r\nlines: 'To die is landing on some silent shore,' etc. When Braddock was\r\ntold of it, he only said: 'Poor Fanny! I always thought she would play\r\ntill she would be forced to _tuck herself up_.'\" Under the name of Miss\r\nSylvia S----, Goldsmith, in his life of Nash, tells the story of this\r\nunhappy woman. She was a rash but warm-hearted creature, reduced to\r\npenury and dependence, not so much by a passion for cards as by her\r\nlavish generosity to a lover ruined by his own follies, and with whom\r\nher relations are said to have been entirely innocent. Walpole\r\ncontinues: \"But a more ridiculous story of Braddock, and which is\r\nrecorded in heroics by Fielding in his _Covent Garden Tragedy,_ was an\r\namorous discussion he had formerly with a Mrs. Upton, who kept him. He\r\nhad gone the greatest lengths with her pin-money, and was still craving.\r\nOne day, that he was very pressing, she pulled out her purse and showed\r\nhim that she had but twelve or fourteen shillings left. He twitched it\r\nfrom her: 'Let me see that.' Tied up at the other end he found five\r\nguineas. He took them, tossed the empty purse in her face, saying: 'Did\r\nyou mean to cheat me?' and never went near her more. Now you are\r\nacquainted with General Braddock.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 192: _Shirley the younger to Morris, 23 May, 1755_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 193: Franklin, _Autobiography_.]\r\n\r\n\"He once had a duel with Colonel Gumley, Lady Bath's brother, who had\r\nbeen his great friend. As they were going to engage, Gumley, who had\r\ngood-humor and wit (Braddock had the latter), said: 'Braddock, you are a\r\npoor dog! Here, take my purse; if you kill me, you will be forced to run\r\naway, and then you will not have a shilling to support you.' Braddock\r\nrefused the purse, insisted on the duel, was disarmed, and would not\r\neven ask his life. However, with all his brutality, he has lately been\r\ngovernor of Gibraltar, where he made himself adored, and where scarce\r\nany governor was endured before.\"[194]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 194: _Letters of Horace Walpole_ (1866), II. 459, 461. It is\r\ndoubtful if Braddock was ever governor of Gibraltar; though, as Mr.\r\nSargent shows, he once commanded a regiment there.]\r\n\r\nAnother story is told of him by an accomplished actress of the time,\r\nGeorge Anne Bellamy, whom Braddock had known from girlhood, and with\r\nwhom his present relations seem to have been those of an elderly adviser\r\nand friend. \"As we were walking in the Park one day, we heard a poor\r\nfellow was to be chastised; when I requested the General to beg off the\r\noffender. Upon his application to the general officer, whose name was\r\nDury, he asked Braddock how long since he had divested himself of the\r\nbrutality and insolence of his manners? To which the other replied: 'You\r\nnever knew me insolent to my inferiors. It is only to such rude men as\r\nyourself that I behave with the spirit which I think they deserve.'\"\r\n\r\nBraddock made a visit to the actress on the evening before he left\r\nLondon for America. \"Before we parted,\" she says, \"the General told me\r\nthat he should never see me more; for he was going with a handful of men\r\nto conquer whole nations; and to do this they must cut their way through\r\nunknown woods. He produced a map of the country, saying at the same\r\ntime: 'Dear Pop, we are sent like sacrifices to the altar,'\"[195]--a\r\nstrange presentiment for a man of his sturdy temper.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 195: _Apology for the Life of George Anne Bellamy, written by\r\nherself_, II. 204 (London, 1786).]\r\n\r\nWhatever were his failings, he feared nothing, and his fidelity and\r\nhonor in the discharge of public trusts were never questioned.\r\n\"Desperate in his fortune, brutal in his behavior, obstinate in his\r\nsentiments,\" again writes Walpole, \"he was still intrepid and\r\ncapable.\"[196] He was a veteran in years and in service, having entered\r\nthe Coldstream Guards as ensign in 1710.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 196: Walpole, _George II._, I. 390.]\r\n\r\nThe transports bringing the two regiments from Ireland all arrived\r\nsafely at Hampton, and were ordered to proceed up the Potomac to\r\nAlexandria, where a camp was to be formed. Thither, towards the end of\r\nMarch, went Braddock himself, along with Keppel and Dinwiddie, in the\r\nGovernor's coach; while his aide-de-camp, Orme, his secretary, Shirley,\r\nand the servants of the party followed on horseback. Braddock had sent\r\nfor the elder Shirley and other provincial governors to meet him in\r\ncouncil; and on the fourteenth of April they assembled in a tent of the\r\nnewly formed encampment. Here was Dinwiddie, who thought his troubles at\r\nan end, and saw in the red-coated soldiery the near fruition of his\r\nhopes. Here, too, was his friend and ally, Dobbs of North Carolina; with\r\nMorris of Pennsylvania, fresh from Assembly quarrels; Sharpe of\r\nMaryland, who, having once been a soldier, had been made a sort of\r\nprovisional commander-in-chief before the arrival of Braddock; and the\r\nambitious Delancey of New York, who had lately led the opposition\r\nagainst the Governor of that province, and now filled the office\r\nhimself,--a position that needed all his manifold adroitness. But, next\r\nto Braddock, the most noteworthy man present was Shirley, governor of\r\nMassachusetts. There was a fountain of youth in this old lawyer. A few\r\nyears before, when he was boundary commissioner in Paris, he had had the\r\nindiscretion to marry a young Catholic French girl, the daughter of his\r\nlandlord; and now, when more than sixty years old, he thirsted for\r\nmilitary honors, and delighted in contriving operations of war. He was\r\none of a very few in the colonies who at this time entertained the idea\r\nof expelling the French from the continent. He held that Carthage must\r\nbe destroyed; and, in spite of his Parisian marriage, was the foremost\r\nadvocate of the root-and-branch policy. He and Lawrence, governor of\r\nNova Scotia, had concerted an attack on the French fort of Beauséjour;\r\nand, jointly with others in New England, he had planned the capture of\r\nCrown Point, the key of Lake Champlain. By these two strokes and by\r\nfortifying the portage between the Kennebec and the Chaudière, he\r\nthought that the northern colonies would be saved from invasion, and\r\nplaced in a position to become themselves invaders. Then, by driving the\r\nenemy from Niagara, securing that important pass, and thus cutting off\r\nthe communication between Canada and her interior dependencies, all the\r\nFrench posts in the West would die of inanition.[197] In order to\r\ncommend these schemes to the Home Government, he had painted in gloomy\r\ncolors the dangers that beset the British colonies. Our Indians, he\r\nsaid, will all desert us if we submit to French encroachment. Some of\r\nthe provinces are full of negro slaves, ready to rise against their\r\nmasters, and of Roman Catholics, Jacobites, indented servants, and other\r\ndangerous persons, who would aid the French in raising a servile\r\ninsurrection. Pennsylvania is in the hands of Quakers, who will not\r\nfight, and of Germans, who are likely enough to join the enemy. The\r\nDutch of Albany would do anything to save their trade. A strong force of\r\nFrench regulars might occupy that place without resistance, then descend\r\nthe Hudson, and, with the help of a naval force, capture New York and\r\ncut the British colonies asunder.[198]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 197: _Correspondence of Shirley, 1754, 1755_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198: _Shirley to Robinson, 24 Jan. 1755_.]\r\n\r\nThe plans against Crown Point and Beauséjour had already found the\r\napproval of the Home Government and the energetic support of all the New\r\nEngland colonies. Preparation for them was in full activity; and it was\r\nwith great difficulty that Shirley had disengaged himself from these\r\ncares to attend the council at Alexandria. He and Dinwiddie stood in the\r\nfront of opposition to French designs. As they both defended the royal\r\nprerogative and were strong advocates of taxation by Parliament, they\r\nhave found scant justice from American writers. Yet the British colonies\r\nowed them a debt of gratitude, and the American States owe it still.\r\n\r\nBraddock, laid his instructions before the Council, and Shirley found\r\nthem entirely to his mind; while the General, on his part, fully\r\napproved the schemes of the Governor. The plan of the campaign was\r\nsettled. The French were to be attacked at four points at once. The two\r\nBritish regiments lately arrived were to advance on Fort Duquesne; two\r\nnew regiments, known as Shirley's and Pepperell's, just raised in the\r\nprovinces, and taken into the King's pay, were to reduce Niagara; a body\r\nof provincials from New England, New York, and New Jersey was to seize\r\nCrown Point; and another body of New England men to capture Beauséjour\r\nand bring Acadia to complete subjection. Braddock himself was to lead\r\nthe expedition against Fort Duquesne. He asked Shirley, who, though a\r\nsoldier only in theory, had held the rank of colonel since the last war,\r\nto charge himself with that against Niagara; and Shirley eagerly\r\nassented. The movement on Crown Point was intrusted to Colonel William\r\nJohnson, by reason of his influence over the Indians and his reputation\r\nfor energy, capacity, and faithfulness. Lastly, the Acadian enterprise\r\nwas assigned to Lieutenant-Colonel Monckton, a regular officer of merit.\r\n\r\nTo strike this fourfold blow in time of peace was a scheme worthy of\r\nNewcastle and of Cumberland. The pretext was that the positions to be\r\nattacked were all on British soil; that in occupying them the French had\r\nbeen guilty of invasion; and that to expel the invaders would be an act\r\nof self-defence. Yet in regard to two of these positions, the French, if\r\nthey had no other right, might at least claim one of prescription. Crown\r\nPoint had been twenty-four years in their undisturbed possession, while\r\nit was three quarters of a century since they first occupied Niagara;\r\nand, though New York claimed the ground, no serious attempt had been\r\nmade to dislodge them.\r\n\r\nOther matters now engaged the Council. Braddock, in accordance with his\r\ninstructions, asked the governors to urge upon their several assemblies\r\nthe establishment of a general fund for the service of the campaign; but\r\nthe governors were all of opinion that the assemblies would\r\nrefuse,--each being resolved to keep the control of its money in its own\r\nhands; and all present, with one voice, advised that the colonies should\r\nbe compelled by Act of Parliament to contribute in due proportion to the\r\nsupport of the war. Braddock next asked if, in the judgment of the\r\nCouncil, it would not be well to send Colonel Johnson with full powers\r\nto treat with the Five Nations, who had been driven to the verge of an\r\noutbreak by the misconduct of the Dutch Indian commissioners at Albany.\r\nThe measure was cordially approved, as was also another suggestion of\r\nthe General, that vessels should be built at Oswego to command Lake\r\nOntario. The Council then dissolved.\r\n\r\nShirley hastened back to New England, burdened with the preparation for\r\nthree expeditions and the command of one of them. Johnson, who had been\r\nin the camp, though not in the Council, went back to Albany, provided\r\nwith a commission as sole superintendent of Indian affairs, and charged,\r\nbesides, with the enterprise against Crown Point; while an express was\r\ndespatched to Monckton at Halifax, with orders to set at once to his\r\nwork of capturing Beauséjour.[199]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199: _Minutes of a Council held at the Camp at Alexandria, in\r\nVirginia, April 14, 1755.

Pennsylvania Archives_, II.]\r\n\r\nIn regard to Braddock's part of the campaign, there had been a serious\r\nerror. If, instead of landing in Virginia and moving on Fort Duquesne\r\nby the long and circuitous route of Wills Creek, the two regiments had\r\ndisembarked at Philadelphia and marched westward, the way would have\r\nbeen shortened, and would have lain through one of the richest and most\r\npopulous districts on the continent, filled with supplies of every kind.\r\nIn Virginia, on the other hand, and in the adjoining province of\r\nMaryland, wagons, horses, and forage were scarce. The enemies of the\r\nAdministration ascribed this blunder to the influence of the Quaker\r\nmerchant, John Hanbury, whom the Duke of Newcastle had consulted as a\r\nperson familiar with American affairs. Hanbury, who was a prominent\r\nstockholder in the Ohio Company, and who traded largely in Virginia, saw\r\nit for his interest that the troops should pass that way; and is said to\r\nhave brought the Duke to this opinion.[200] A writer of the time thinks\r\nthat if they had landed in Pennsylvania, forty thousand pounds would\r\nhave been saved in money, and six weeks in time.[201]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 200: _Shebbeare's Tracts_, Letter I. Dr. Shebbeare was a\r\npolitical pamphleteer, pilloried by one ministry, and rewarded by the\r\nnext. He certainly speaks of Hanbury, though he does not give his name.\r\nCompare Sargent, 107, 162.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 201: _Gentleman's Magazine, Aug_. 1755.]\r\n\r\nNot only were supplies scarce, but the people showed such unwillingness\r\nto furnish them, and such apathy in aiding the expedition, that even\r\nWashington was provoked to declare that \"they ought to be\r\nchastised.\"[202] Many of them thought that the alarm about French\r\nencroachment was a device of designing politicians; and they did not\r\nawake to a full consciousness of the peril till it was forced upon them\r\nby a deluge of calamities, produced by the purblind folly of their own\r\nrepresentatives, who, instead of frankly promoting the expedition,\r\ndisplayed a perverse and exasperating narrowness which chafed Braddock\r\nto fury. He praises the New England colonies, and echoes Dinwiddie's\r\ndeclaration that they have shown a \"fine martial spirit,\" and he\r\ncommends Virginia as having done far better than her neighbors; but for\r\nPennsylvania he finds no words to express his wrath.[203] He knew\r\nnothing of the intestine war between proprietaries and people, and hence\r\ncould see no palliation for a conduct which threatened to ruin both the\r\nexpedition and the colony. Everything depended on speed, and speed was\r\nimpossible; for stores and provisions were not ready, though notice to\r\nfurnish them had been given months before. The quartermaster-general,\r\nSir John Sinclair, \"stormed like a lion rampant,\" but with small\r\neffect.[204] Contracts broken or disavowed, want of horses, want of\r\nwagons, want of forage, want of wholesome food, or sufficient food of\r\nany kind, caused such delay that the report of it reached England, and\r\ndrew from Walpole the comment that Braddock was in no hurry to be\r\nscalped. In reality he was maddened with impatience and vexation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 202: _Writings of Washington_, II. 78. He speaks of the people\r\nof Pennsylvania.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 203: _Braddock to Robinson, 18 March, 19 April, 5 June, 1755_,\r\netc. On the attitude of Pennsylvania, _Colonial Records of Pa_., VI.,\r\n_passim_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 204: _Colonial Records of Pa_., VI. 368.]\r\n\r\nA powerful ally presently came to his aid in the shape of Benjamin\r\nFranklin, then postmaster-general of Pennsylvania. That sagacious\r\npersonage,--the sublime of common-sense, about equal in his instincts\r\nand motives of character to the respectable average of the New England\r\nthat produced him, but gifted with a versatile power of brain rarely\r\nmatched on earth,--was then divided between his strong desire to repel a\r\ndanger of which he saw the imminence, and his equally strong antagonism\r\nto the selfish claims of the Penns, proprietaries of Pennsylvania. This\r\nlast motive had determined his attitude towards their representative,\r\nthe Governor, and led him into an opposition as injurious to the\r\nmilitary good name of the province as it was favorable to its political\r\nlongings. In the present case there was no such conflict of\r\ninclinations; he could help Braddock without hurting Pennsylvania. He\r\nand his son had visited the camp, and found the General waiting\r\nrestlessly for the report of the agents whom he had sent to collect\r\nwagons. \"I stayed with him,\" says Franklin, \"several days, and dined\r\nwith him daily. When I was about to depart, the returns of wagons to be\r\nobtained were brought in, by which it appeared that they amounted only\r\nto twenty-five, and not all of these were in serviceable condition.\" On\r\nthis the General and his officers declared that the expedition was at an\r\nend, and denounced the Ministry for sending them into a country void of\r\nthe means of transportation. Franklin remarked that it was a pity they\r\nhad not landed in Pennsylvania, where almost every farmer had his wagon.\r\nBraddock caught eagerly at his words, and begged that he would use his\r\ninfluence to enable the troops to move. Franklin went back to\r\nPennsylvania, issued an address to the farmers appealing to their\r\ninterest and their fears, and in a fortnight procured a hundred and\r\nfifty wagons, with a large number of horses.[205] Braddock, grateful to\r\nhis benefactor, and enraged at everybody else, pronounced him \"Almost\r\nthe only instance of ability and honesty I have known in these\r\nprovinces.\"[206] More wagons and more horses gradually arrived, and at\r\nthe eleventh hour the march began.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 205: Franklin, _Autobiography. Advertisement of B. Franklin\r\nfor Wagons; Address to the Inhabitants of the Counties of York,\r\nLancaster, and Cumberland, Pennsylvania Archives,_II.294]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 206: _Braddock to Robinson,5 June_,1755. The letters of\r\nBraddock here cited are the originals in the Public Record Office]\r\n\r\nOn the tenth of May Braddock reached Wills Creek, where the whole force\r\nwas now gathered, having marched thither by detachments along the banks\r\nof the Potomac. This old trading-station of the Ohio Company had been\r\ntransformed into a military post and named Fort Cumberland. During the\r\npast winter the independent companies which had failed Washington in his\r\nneed had been at work here to prepare a base of operations for Braddock.\r\nTheir axes had been of more avail than their muskets. A broad wound had\r\nbeen cut in the bosom of the forest, and the murdered oaks and chestnuts\r\nturned into ramparts, barracks, and magazines. Fort Cumberland was an\r\nenclosure of logs set upright in the ground, pierced with loopholes, and\r\narmed with ten small cannon. It stood on a rising ground near the point\r\nwhere Wills Creek joined the Potomac, and the forest girded it like a\r\nmighty hedge, or rather like a paling of gaunt brown stems upholding a\r\ncanopy of green. All around spread illimitable woods, wrapping hill,\r\nvalley, and mountain. The spot was an oasis in a desert of leaves,--if\r\nthe name oasis can be given to anything so rude and harsh. In this\r\nrugged area, or \"clearing,\" all Braddock's force was now assembled,\r\namounting, regulars, provincials, and sailors, to about twenty-two\r\nhundred men. The two regiments, Halket's and Dunbar's, had been\r\ncompleted by enlistment in Virginia to seven hundred men each. Of\r\nVirginians there were nine companies of fifty men, who found no favor in\r\nthe eyes of Braddock or his officers. To Ensign Allen of Halket's\r\nregiment was assigned the duty of \"making them as much like soldiers as\r\npossible.\"[207]--that is, of drilling them like regulars. The General\r\nhad little hope of them, and informed Sir Thomas Robinson that \"their\r\nslothful and languid disposition renders them very unfit for military\r\nservice,\"--a point on which he lived to change his mind. Thirty sailors,\r\nwhom Commodore Keppel had lent him, were more to his liking, and were in\r\nfact of value in many ways. He had now about six hundred baggage-horses,\r\nbesides those of the artillery, all weakening daily on their diet of\r\nleaves; for no grass was to be found. There was great show of\r\ndiscipline, and little real order. Braddock's executive capacity seems\r\nto have been moderate, and his dogged, imperious temper, rasped by\r\ndisappointments, was in constant irritation. \"He looks upon the country,\r\nI believe,\" writes Washington, \"as void of honor or honesty. We have\r\nfrequent disputes on this head, which are maintained with warmth on both\r\nsides, especially on his, as he is incapable of arguing without it, or\r\ngiving up any point he asserts, be it ever so incompatible with reason\r\nor common sense.\"[208] Braddock's secretary, the younger Shirley,\r\nwriting to his friend Governor Morris, spoke thus irreverently of his\r\nchief: \"As the King said of a neighboring governor of yours [_Sharpe_],\r\nwhen proposed for the command of the American forces about a twelvemonth\r\nago, and recommended as a very honest man, though not remarkably able,\r\n'a little more ability and a little less honesty upon the present\r\noccasion might serve our turn better.' It is a joke to suppose that\r\nsecondary officers can make amends for the defects of the first; the\r\nmainspring must be the mover. As to the others, I don't think we have\r\nmuch to boast; some are insolent and ignorant, others capable, but\r\nrather aiming at showing their own abilities than making a proper use of\r\nthem. I have a very great love for my friend Orme, and think it\r\nuncommonly fortunate for our leader that he is under the influence of so\r\nhonest and capable a man; but I wish for the sake of the public he had\r\nsome more experience of business, particularly in America. I am greatly\r\ndisgusted at seeing an expedition (as it is called), so ill-concerted\r\noriginally in England, so improperly conducted since in America.\"[209]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 207: Orme, _Journal_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 208: _Writings of Washington_, II. 77.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 209: _Shirley the younger to Morris, 23 May, 1755_, in\r\n_Colonial Records of Pa._, VI. 404.]\r\n\r\nCaptain Robert Orme, of whom Shirley speaks, was aide-de-camp to\r\nBraddock, and author of a copious and excellent Journal of the\r\nexpedition, now in the British Museum.[210] His portrait, painted at\r\nfull length by Sir Joshua Reynolds, hangs in the National Gallery at\r\nLondon. He stands by his horse, a gallant young figure, with a face\r\npale, yet rather handsome, booted to the knee, his scarlet coat, ample\r\nwaistcoat, and small three-cornered hat all heavy with gold lace. The\r\nGeneral had two other aides-de-camp, Captain Roger Morris and Colonel\r\nGeorge Washington, whom he had invited, in terms that do him honor, to\r\nbecome one of his military family.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 210: Printed by Sargent, in his excellent monograph of\r\nBraddock's Expedition.]\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Braddock despised not only provincials, but\r\nIndians. Nevertheless he took some pains to secure their aid, and\r\ncomplained that Indian affairs had been so ill conducted by the\r\nprovinces that it was hard to gain their confidence. This was true; the\r\ntribes had been alienated by gross neglect. Had they been protected from\r\ninjustice and soothed by attentions and presents, the Five Nations,\r\nDelawares, and Shawanoes would have been retained as friends. But their\r\ncomplaints had been slighted, and every gift begrudged. The trader\r\nCroghan brought, however, about fifty warriors, with as many women and\r\nchildren, to the camp at Fort Cumberland. They were objects of great\r\ncuriosity to the soldiers, who gazed with astonishment on their faces,\r\npainted red, yellow, and black, their ears slit and hung with pendants,\r\nand their heads close shaved, except the feathered scalp-lock at the\r\ncrown. \"In the day,\" says an officer, \"they are in our camp, and in the\r\nnight they go into their own, where they dance and make a most horrible\r\nnoise.\" Braddock received them several times in his tent, ordered the\r\nguard to salute them, made them speeches, caused cannon to be fired and\r\ndrums and fifes to play in their honor, regaled them with rum, and gave\r\nthem a bullock for a feast; whereupon, being much pleased, they danced a\r\nwar-dance, described by one spectator as \"droll and odd, showing how\r\nthey scalp and fight;\" after which, says another, \"they set up the most\r\nhorrid song or cry that ever I heard.\"[211] These warriors, with a few\r\nothers, promised the General to join him on the march; but he apparently\r\ngrew tired of them, for a famous chief, called Scarroyaddy, afterwards\r\ncomplained: \"He looked upon us as dogs, and would never hear anything\r\nthat we said to him.\" Only eight of them remained with him to the\r\nend.[212]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 211: _Journal of a Naval Officer_, in Sargent. _The Expedition\r\nof Major-General Braddock, being Extracts of Letters from an Officer_\r\n(London, 1755).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 212: _Statement of George Croghan_, in Sargent, appendix iii.]\r\n\r\nAnother ally appeared at the camp. This was a personage long known in\r\nWestern fireside story as Captain Jack, the Black Hunter, or the Black\r\nRifle. It was said of him that, having been a settler on the farthest\r\nfrontier, in the Valley of the Juniata, he returned one evening to his\r\ncabin and found it burned to the ground by Indians, and the bodies of\r\nhis wife and children lying among the ruins. He vowed undying vengeance,\r\nraised a band of kindred spirits, dressed and painted like Indians, and\r\nbecame the scourge of the red man and the champion of the white. But he\r\nand his wild crew, useful as they might have been, shocked Braddock's\r\nsense of military fitness; and he received them so coldly that they left\r\nhim.[213]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 213: See several traditional accounts and contemporary letters\r\nin _Hazard's Pennsylvania Register_, IV. 389, 390, 416; V. 191.]\r\n\r\nIt was the tenth of June before the army was well on its march. Three\r\nhundred axemen led the way, to cut and clear the road; and the long\r\ntrain of packhorses, wagons, and cannon toiled on behind, over the\r\nstumps, roots, and stones of the narrow track, the regulars and\r\nprovincials marching in the forest close on either side. Squads of men\r\nwere thrown out on the flanks, and scouts ranged the woods to guard\r\nagainst surprise; for, with all his scorn of Indians and Canadians,\r\nBraddock did not neglect reasonable precautions. Thus, foot by foot,\r\nthey advanced into the waste of lonely mountains that divided the\r\nstreams flowing to the Atlantic from those flowing to the Gulf of\r\nMexico,--a realm of forests ancient as the world. The road was but\r\ntwelve feet wide, and the line of march often extended four miles. It\r\nwas like a thin, long party-colored snake, red, blue, and brown,\r\ntrailing slowly through the depth of leaves, creeping round inaccessible\r\nheights, crawling over ridges, moving always in dampness and shadow, by\r\nrivulets and waterfalls, crags and chasms, gorges and shaggy steps. In\r\nglimpses only, through jagged boughs and flickering leaves, did this\r\nwild primeval world reveal itself, with its dark green mountains,\r\nflecked with the morning mist, and its distant summits pencilled in\r\ndreamy blue. The army passed the main Alleghany, Meadow Mountain, and\r\nGreat Savage Mountain, and traversed the funereal pine-forest afterwards\r\ncalled the Shades of Death. No attempt was made to interrupt their\r\nmarch, though the commandant of Fort Duquesne had sent out parties for\r\nthat purpose. A few French and Indians hovered about them, now and then\r\nscalping a straggler or inscribing filthy insults on trees; while others\r\nfell upon the border settlements which the advance of the troops had\r\nleft defenceless. Here they were more successful, butchering about\r\nthirty persons, chiefly women and children.\r\n\r\nIt was the eighteenth of June before the army reached a place called the\r\nLittle Meadows, less than thirty miles from Fort Cumberland. Fever and\r\ndysentery among the men, and the weakness and worthlessness of many of\r\nthe horses, joined to the extreme difficulty of the road, so retarded\r\nthem that they could move scarcely more than three miles a day. Braddock\r\nconsulted with Washington, who advised him to leave the heavy baggage\r\nto follow as it could, and push forward with a body of chosen troops.\r\nThis counsel was given in view of a report that five hundred regulars\r\nwere on the way to reinforce Fort Duquesne. It was adopted. Colonel\r\nDunbar was left to command the rear division, whose powers of movement\r\nwere now reduced to the lowest point. The advance corps, consisting of\r\nabout twelve hundred soldiers, besides officers and drivers, began its\r\nmarch on the nineteenth with such artillery as was thought\r\nindispensable, thirty wagons, and a large number of packhorses. \"The\r\nprospect,\" writes Washington to his brother, \"conveyed infinite delight\r\nto my mind, though I was excessively ill at the time. But this prospect\r\nwas soon clouded, and my hopes brought very low indeed when I found\r\nthat, instead of pushing on with vigor without regarding a little rough\r\nroad, they were halting to level every mole-hill, and to erect bridges\r\nover every brook, by which means we were four days in getting twelve\r\nmiles.\" It was not till the seventh of July that they neared the mouth\r\nof Turtle Creek, a stream entering the Monongahela about eight miles\r\nfrom the French fort. The way was direct and short, but would lead them\r\nthrough a difficult country and a defile so perilous that Braddock\r\nresolved to ford the Monongahela to avoid this danger, and then ford it\r\nagain to reach his destination.\r\n\r\nFort Duquesne stood on the point of land where the Alleghany and the\r\nMonongahela join to form the Ohio, and where now stands Pittsburg, with\r\nits swarming population, its restless industries, the clang of its\r\nforges, and its chimneys vomiting foul smoke into the face of heaven. At\r\nthat early day a white flag fluttering over a cluster of palisades and\r\nembankments betokened the first intrusion of civilized men upon a scene\r\nwhich, a few months before, breathed the repose of a virgin wilderness,\r\nvoiceless but for the lapping of waves upon the pebbles, or the note of\r\nsome lonely bird. But now the sleep of ages was broken, and bugle and\r\ndrum told the astonished forest that its doom was pronounced and its\r\ndays numbered. The fort was a compact little work, solidly built and\r\nstrong, compared with others on the continent. It was a square of four\r\nbastions, with the water close on two sides, and the other two protected\r\nby ravelins, ditch, glacis, and covered way. The ramparts on these sides\r\nwere of squared logs, filled in with earth, and ten feet or more thick.\r\nThe two water sides were enclosed by a massive stockade of upright logs,\r\ntwelve feet high, mortised together and loopholed. The armament\r\nconsisted of a number of small cannon mounted on the bastions. A gate\r\nand drawbridge on the east side gave access to the area within, which\r\nwas surrounded by barracks for the soldiers, officers' quarters, the\r\nlodgings of the commandant, a guardhouse, and a storehouse, all built\r\npartly of logs and partly of boards. There were no casemates, and the\r\nplace was commanded by a high woody hill beyond the Monongahela. The\r\nforest had been cleared away to the distance of more than a musket shot\r\nfrom the ramparts, and the stumps were hacked level with the ground.\r\nHere, just outside the ditch, bark cabins had been built for such of the\r\ntroops and Canadians as could not find room within; and the rest of the\r\nopen space was covered with Indian corn and other crops.[214]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 214: _M'Kinney's Description of Fort Duquesne, 1756_, in\r\n_Hazard's Pennsylvania Register_, VIII. 318. _Letters of Robert Stobo,\r\nHostage at Fort Duquesne, 1754_, in _Colonial Records of Pa._ VI. 141,\r\n161. Stobo's _Plan of Fort Duquesne, 1754. Journal of Thomas Forbes,\r\n1755. Letter of Captain Haslet, 1758_, in _Olden Time_, I. 184. _Plan of\r\nFort Duquesne_ in Public Record Office.]\r\n\r\nThe garrison consisted of a few companies of the regular troops\r\nstationed permanently in the colony, and to these were added a\r\nconsiderable number of Canadians. Contrecoeur still held the\r\ncommand.[215] Under him were three other captains, Beaujeu, Dumas, and\r\nLigneris. Besides the troops and Canadians, eight hundred Indian\r\nwarriors, mustered from far and near, had built their wigwams and\r\ncamp-sheds on the open ground, or under the edge of the neighboring\r\nwoods,--very little to the advantage of the young corn. Some were\r\nbaptized savages settled in Canada,--Caughnawagas from Saut St. Louis,\r\nAbenakis from St. Francis, and Hurons from Lorette, whose chief bore the\r\nname of Anastase, in honor of that Father of the Church. The rest were\r\nunmitigated heathen,--Pottawattamies and Ojibwas from the northern lakes\r\nunder Charles Langlade, the same bold partisan who had led them, three\r\nyears before, to attack the Miamis at Pickawillany; Shawanoes and\r\nMingoes from the Ohio; and Ottawas from Detroit, commanded, it is said,\r\nby that most redoubtable of savages, Pontiac. The law of the survival of\r\nthe fittest had wrought on this heterogeneous crew through countless\r\ngenerations; and with the primitive Indian, the fittest was the\r\nhardiest, fiercest, most adroit, and most wily. Baptized and heathen\r\nalike they had just enjoyed a diversion greatly to their taste. A young\r\nPennsylvanian named James Smith, a spirited and intelligent boy of\r\neighteen, had been waylaid by three Indians on the western borders of\r\nthe province and led captive to the fort. When the party came to the\r\nedge of the clearing, his captors, who had shot and scalped his\r\ncompanion, raised the scalp-yell; whereupon a din of responsive whoops\r\nand firing of guns rose from all the Indian camps, and their inmates\r\nswarmed out like bees, while the French in the fort shot off muskets and\r\ncannon to honor the occasion. The unfortunate boy, the object of this\r\nobstreperous rejoicing, presently saw a multitude of savages, naked,\r\nhideously bedaubed with red, blue, black, and brown, and armed with\r\nsticks or clubs, ranging themselves in two long parallel lines, between\r\nwhich he was told that he must run, the faster the better, as they would\r\nbeat him all the way. He ran with his best speed, under a shower of\r\nblows, and had nearly reached the end of the course, when he was knocked\r\ndown. He tried to rise, but was blinded by a handful of sand thrown into\r\nhis face; and then they beat him till he swooned. On coming to his\r\nsenses he found himself in the fort, with the surgeon opening a vein in\r\nhis arm and a crowd of French and Indians looking on. In a few days he\r\nwas able to walk with the help of a stick; and, coming out from his\r\nquarters one morning, he saw a memorable scene.[216]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 215: See Appendix D.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: _Account of Remarkable Occurrences in the Life of Colonel\r\nJames Smith, written by himself_. Perhaps the best of all the numerous\r\nnarratives of captives among the Indians.]\r\n\r\nThree days before, an Indian had brought the report that the English\r\nwere approaching; and the Chevalier de la Perade was sent out to\r\nreconnoitre.[217] He returned on the next day, the seventh, with news\r\nthat they were not far distant. On the eighth the brothers Normanville\r\nwent out, and found that they were within six leagues of the fort. The\r\nFrench were in great excitement and alarm; but Contrecoeur at length\r\ntook a resolution, which seems to have been inspired by Beaujeu.[218] It\r\nwas determined to meet the enemy on the march, and ambuscade them if\r\npossible at the crossing of the Monongahela, or some other favorable\r\nspot. Beaujeu proposed the plan to the Indians, and offered them the\r\nwar-hatchet; but they would not take it. \"Do you want to die, my father,\r\nand sacrifice us besides?\" That night they held a council, and in the\r\nmorning again refused to go. Beaujeu did not despair. \"I am determined,\"\r\nhe exclaimed, \"to meet the English. What! will you let your father go\r\nalone?\"[219] The greater part caught fire at his words, promised to\r\nfollow him and put on their war-paint. Beaujeu received the communion,\r\nthen dressed himself like a savage, and joined the clamorous throng.\r\nOpen barrels of gunpowder and bullets were set before the gate of the\r\nfort, and James Smith, painfully climbing the rampart with the help of\r\nhis stick, looked down on the warrior rabble as, huddling together, wild\r\nwith excitement, they scooped up the contents to fill their powder-horns\r\nand pouches. Then, band after band, they filed off along the forest\r\ntrack that led to the ford of the Monongahela. They numbered six hundred\r\nand thirty-seven; and with them went thirty-six French officers and\r\ncadets, seventy-two regular soldiers, and a hundred and forty-six\r\nCanadians, or about nine hundred in all.[220] At eight o'clock the\r\ntumult was over. The broad clearing lay lonely and still, and\r\nContrecoeur, with what was left of his garrison, waited in suspense for\r\nthe issue.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: _Relation de Godefroy_, in Shea, _Bataille du\r\nMalangueulé_ (Monongahela).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 218: Dumas, however, declares that Beaujeu adopted the plan at\r\nhis suggestion. _Dumas au Ministre, 24 Juillet, 1756_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 219: _Relation depuis le Départ des Trouppes de Québec\r\njusqu'au 30 du Mois de Septembre, 1755_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 220: _Liste des Officiers, Cadets, Soldats, Miliciens, et\r\nSauvages qui composaient le Détachement qui a été au devant d'un Corps\r\nde 2,000 Anglois à 3 Lieues du Fort Duquesne, le 9 Juillet, 1755; joint\r\nà la Lettre de M. Bigot du 6 Août, 1755_.]\r\n\r\nIt was near one o'clock when Braddock crossed the Monongahela for the\r\nsecond time. If the French made a stand anywhere, it would be, he\r\nthought, at the fording-place; but Lieutenant-Colonel Gage, whom he sent\r\nacross with a strong advance-party, found no enemy, and quietly took\r\npossession of the farther shore. Then the main body followed. To impose\r\non the imagination of the French scouts, who were doubtless on the\r\nwatch, the movement was made with studied regularity and order. The sun\r\nwas cloudless, and the men were inspirited by the prospect of near\r\ntriumph. Washington afterwards spoke with admiration of the\r\nspectacle.[221] The music, the banners, the mounted officers, the troop\r\nof light cavalry, the naval detachment, the red-coated regulars, the\r\nblue-coated Virginians, the wagons and tumbrils, cannon, howitzers, and\r\ncoehorns, the train of packhorses, and the droves of cattle, passed in\r\nlong procession through the rippling shallows, and slowly entered the\r\nbordering forest. Here, when all were over, a short halt was ordered for\r\nrest and refreshment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 221: Compare the account of another eye-witness, Dr. Walker,\r\nin _Hazard's Pennsylvania Register_, VI. 104.]\r\n\r\nWhy had not Beaujeu defended the ford? This was his intention in the\r\nmorning; but he had been met by obstacles, the nature of which is not\r\nwholly clear. His Indians, it seems, had proved refractory. Three\r\nhundred of them left him, went off in another direction, and did not\r\nrejoin him till the English had crossed the river.[222] Hence perhaps it\r\nwas that, having left Fort Duquesne at eight o'clock, he spent half the\r\nday in marching seven miles, and was more than a mile from the\r\nfording-place when the British reached the eastern shore. The delay,\r\nfrom whatever cause arising, cost him the opportunity of laying an\r\nambush either at the ford or in the gullies and ravines that channelled\r\nthe forest through which Braddock was now on the point of marching.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 222: _Relation de Godefroy_, in Shea, _Bataille du\r\nMalangueulé_.]\r\n\r\nNot far from the bank of the river, and close by the British line of\r\nmarch, there was a clearing and a deserted house that had once belonged\r\nto the trader Fraser. Washington remembered it well. It was here that he\r\nfound rest and shelter on the winter journey homeward from his mission\r\nto Fort Le Boeuf. He was in no less need of rest at this moment; for\r\nrecent fever had so weakened him that he could hardly sit his horse.\r\nFrom Fraser's house to Fort Duquesne the distance was eight miles by a\r\nrough path, along which the troops were now beginning to move after\r\ntheir halt. It ran inland for a little; then curved to the left, and\r\nfollowed a course parallel to the river along the base of a line of\r\nsteep hills that here bordered the valley. These and all the country\r\nwere buried in dense and heavy forest, choked with bushes and the\r\ncarcases of fallen trees. Braddock has been charged with marching\r\nblindly into an ambuscade; but it was not so. There was no ambuscade;\r\nand had there been one, he would have found it. It is true that he did\r\nnot reconnoitre the woods very far in advance of the head of the column;\r\nyet, with this exception, he made elaborate dispositions to prevent\r\nsurprise. Several guides, with six Virginian light horsemen, led the\r\nway. Then, a musket-shot behind, came the vanguard; then three hundred\r\nsoldiers under Gage; then a large body of axemen, under Sir John\r\nSinclair, to open the road; then two cannon with tumbrils and\r\ntool-wagons; and lastly the rear-guard, closing the line, while\r\nflanking-parties ranged the woods on both sides. This was the\r\nadvance-column. The main body followed with little or no interval. The\r\nartillery and wagons moved along the road, and the troops filed through\r\nthe woods close on either hand. Numerous flanking-parties were thrown\r\nout a hundred yards and more to right and left; while, in the space\r\nbetween them and the marching column, the pack horses and cattle, with\r\ntheir drivers, made their way painfully among the trees and thickets;\r\nsince, had they been allowed to follow the road, the line of march would\r\nhave been too long for mutual support. A body of regulars and\r\nprovincials brought up the rear.\r\n\r\nGage, with his advance-column, had just passed a wide and bushy ravine\r\nthat crossed their path, and the van of the main column was on the point\r\nof entering it, when the guides and light horsemen in the front suddenly\r\nfell back; and the engineer, Gordon, then engaged in marking out the\r\nroad, saw a man, dressed like an Indian, but wearing the gorget of an\r\nofficer, bounding forward along the path.[223] He stopped when he\r\ndiscovered the head of the column, turned, and waved his hat. The forest\r\nbehind was swarming with French and savages. At the signal of the\r\nofficer, who was probably Beaujeu, they yelled the war-whoop, spread\r\nthemselves to right and left, and opened a sharp fire under cover of the\r\ntrees. Gage's column wheeled deliberately into line, and fired several\r\nvolleys with great steadiness against the now invisible assailants. Few\r\nof them were hurt; the trees caught the shot, but the noise was\r\ndeafening under the dense arches of the forest. The greater part of the\r\nCanadians, to borrow the words of Dumas, \"fled shamefully, crying 'Sauve\r\nqui peut!'\"[224] Volley followed volley, and at the third Beaujeu\r\ndropped dead. Gage's two cannon were now brought to bear, on which the\r\nIndians, like the Canadians, gave way in confusion, but did not, like\r\nthem, abandon the field. The close scarlet ranks of the English were\r\nplainly to be seen through the trees and the smoke; they were moving\r\nforward, cheering lustily, and shouting \"God save the King.\" Dumas, now\r\nchief in command, thought that all was lost. \"I advanced,\" he says,\r\n\"with the assurance that comes from despair, exciting by voice and\r\ngesture the few soldiers that remained. The fire of my platoon was so\r\nsharp that the enemy seemed astonished.\" The Indians, encouraged, began\r\nto rally. The French officers who commanded them showed admirable\r\ncourage and address; and while Dumas and Ligneris, with the regulars and\r\nwhat was left of the Canadians, held the ground in front, the savage\r\nwarriors, screeching their war-cries, swarmed through the forest along\r\nboth flanks of the English, hid behind trees, bushes, and fallen trunks,\r\nor crouched in gullies and ravines, and opened a deadly fire on the\r\nhelpless soldiery, who, themselves completely visible, could see no\r\nenemy, and wasted volley after volley on the impassive trees. The most\r\ndestructive fire came from a hill on the English right, where the\r\nIndians lay in multitudes, firing from their lurking-places on the\r\nliving target below. But the invisible death was everywhere, in front,\r\nflank, and rear. The British cheer was heard no more. The troops broke\r\ntheir ranks and huddled together in a bewildered mass, shrinking from\r\nthe bullets that cut them down by scores.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 223: _Journal of the Proceeding of the Detachment of Seamen_,\r\nin Sargent.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 224: _Dumas au Ministre, 24 Juillet, 1756. Contrecoeur à\r\nVaudreuil, 14 Juillet, 1755_. See Appendix D, where extracts are given.]\r\n\r\nWhen Braddock heard the firing in the front, he pushed forward with the\r\nmain body to the support of Gage, leaving four hundred men in the rear,\r\nunder Sir Peter Halket, to guard the baggage. At the moment of his\r\narrival Gage's soldiers had abandoned their two cannon, and were falling\r\nback to escape the concentrated fire of the Indians. Meeting the\r\nadvancing troops, they tried to find cover behind them. This threw the\r\nwhole into confusion. The men of the two regiments became mixed\r\ntogether; and in a short time the entire force, except the Virginians\r\nand the troops left with Halket, were massed in several dense bodies\r\nwithin a small space of ground, facing some one way and some another,\r\nand all alike exposed without shelter to the bullets that pelted them\r\nlike hail. Both men and officers were new to this blind and frightful\r\nwarfare of the savage in his native woods. To charge the Indians in\r\ntheir hiding-places would have been useless. They would have eluded\r\npursuit with the agility of wildcats, and swarmed back, like angry\r\nhornets, the moment that it ceased. The Virginians alone were equal to\r\nthe emergency. Fighting behind trees like the Indians themselves, they\r\nmight have held the enemy in check till order could be restored, had not\r\nBraddock, furious at a proceeding that shocked all his ideas of courage\r\nand discipline, ordered them, with oaths, to form into line. A body of\r\nthem under Captain Waggoner made a dash for a fallen tree lying in the\r\nwoods, far out towards the lurking-places of the Indians, and, crouching\r\nbehind the huge trunk, opened fire; but the regulars, seeing the smoke\r\namong the bushes, mistook their best friends for the enemy, shot at them\r\nfrom behind, killed many, and forced the rest to return. A few of the\r\nregulars also tried in their clumsy way to fight behind trees; but\r\nBraddock beat them with his sword, and compelled them to stand with the\r\nrest, an open mark for the Indians. The panic increased; the soldiers\r\ncrowded together, and the bullets spent themselves in a mass of human\r\nbodies. Commands, entreaties, and threats were lost upon them. \"We would\r\nfight,\" some of them answered, \"if we could see anybody to fight with.\"\r\nNothing was visible but puffs of smoke. Officers and men who had stood\r\nall the afternoon under fire afterwards declared that they could not be\r\nsure they had seen a single Indian. Braddock ordered Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nBurton to attack the hill where the puffs of smoke were thickest, and\r\nthe bullets most deadly. With infinite difficulty that brave officer\r\ninduced a hundred men to follow him; but he was soon disabled by a\r\nwound, and they all faced about. The artillerymen stood for some time by\r\ntheir guns, which did great damage to the trees and little to the enemy.\r\nThe mob of soldiers, stupefied with terror, stood panting, their\r\nforeheads beaded with sweat, loading and firing mechanically, sometimes\r\ninto the air, sometimes among their own comrades, many of whom they\r\nkilled. The ground, strewn with dead and wounded men, the bounding of\r\nmaddened horses, the clatter and roar of musketry and cannon, mixed with\r\nthe spiteful report of rifles and the yells that rose from the\r\nindefatigable throats of six hundred unseen savages, formed a chaos of\r\nanguish and terror scarcely paralleled even in Indian war. \"I cannot\r\ndescribe the horrors of that scene,\" one of Braddock's officers wrote\r\nthree weeks after; \"no pen could do it. The yell of the Indians is fresh\r\non my ear, and the terrific sound will haunt me till the hour of my\r\ndissolution.\"[225]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 225: _Leslie to a Merchant of Philadelphia, 30 July, 1755_, in\r\n_Hazard's Pennsylvania Register_, V. 191. Leslie was a lieutenant of the\r\nForty-fourth.]\r\n\r\nBraddock showed a furious intrepidity. Mounted on horseback, he dashed\r\nto and fro, storming like a madman. Four horses were shot under him, and\r\nhe mounted a fifth. Washington seconded his chief with equal courage; he\r\ntoo no doubt using strong language, for he did not measure words when\r\nthe fit was on him. He escaped as by miracle. Two horses were killed\r\nunder him, and four bullets tore his clothes. The conduct of the British\r\nofficers was above praise. Nothing could surpass their undaunted\r\nself-devotion; and in their vain attempts to lead on the men, the havoc\r\namong them was frightful. Sir Peter Halket was shot dead. His son, a\r\nlieutenant in his regiment, stooping to raise the body of his father,\r\nwas shot dead in turn. Young Shirley, Braddock's secretary, was pierced\r\nthrough the brain. Orme and Morris, his aides-de-camp, Sinclair, the\r\nquartermaster-general, Gates and Gage, both afterwards conspicuous on\r\nopposite sides in the War of the Revolution, and Gladwin, who, eight\r\nyears later, defended Detroit against Pontiac, were all wounded. Of\r\neighty-six officers, sixty-three were killed or disabled;[226] while out\r\nof thirteen hundred and seventy-three noncommissioned officers and\r\nprivates, only four hundred and fifty-nine came off unharmed.[227]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 226: _A List of the Officers who were present, and of those\r\nkilled and wounded, in the Action on the Banks of the Monongahela, 9\r\nJuly, 1755_ (Public Record Office, _America and West Indies_, LXXXII).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 227: Statement of the engineer, Mackellar. By another account,\r\nout of a total, officers and men, of 1,460, the number of all ranks who\r\nescaped was 583. Braddock's force, originally 1,200, was increased, a\r\nfew days before the battle, by detachments from Dunbar.]\r\n\r\nBraddock saw that all was lost. To save the wreck of his force from\r\nannihilation, he at last commanded a retreat; and as he and such of his\r\nofficers as were left strove to withdraw the half-frenzied crew in some\r\nsemblance of order, a bullet struck him down. The gallant bulldog fell\r\nfrom his horse, shot through the arm into the lungs. It is said, though\r\non evidence of no weight, that the bullet came from one of his own men.\r\nBe this as it may, there he lay among the bushes, bleeding, gasping,\r\nunable even to curse. He demanded to be left where he was. Captain\r\nStewart and another provincial bore him between them to the rear.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that the mob of soldiers, having been three hours\r\nunder fire, and having spent their ammunition, broke away in a blind\r\nfrenzy, rushed back towards the ford, \"and when,\" says Washington, \"we\r\nendeavored to rally them, it was with as much success as if we had\r\nattempted to stop the wild bears of the mountains.\" They dashed across,\r\nhelter-skelter, plunging through the water to the farther bank, leaving\r\nwounded comrades, cannon, baggage, the military chest, and the General's\r\npapers, a prey to the Indians. About fifty of these followed to the edge\r\nof the river. Dumas and Ligneris, who had now only about twenty\r\nFrenchmen with them, made no attempt to pursue, and went back to the\r\nfort, because, says Contrecoeur, so many of the Canadians had \"retired\r\nat the first fire.\" The field, abandoned to the savages, was a\r\npandemonium of pillage and murder.[228]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 228: \"Nous prîmes le parti de nous retirer en vue de rallier\r\nnotre petite armée.\" _Dumas au Ministre, 24 Juillet, 1756_.\r\n\r\nOn the defeat of Braddock, besides authorities already cited,--_Shirley\r\nto Robinson, 5 Nov. 1755_, accompanying the plans of the battle\r\nreproduced in this volume (Public Record Office, _America and West\r\nIndies_, LXXXIL).

I had observed\r\nsome of the old-country soldiers speak Dutch; as I spoke Dutch, I went\r\nto one of them and asked him what was the news. He told me that a runner\r\nhad just arrived who said that Braddock would certainly be defeated;\r\nthat the Indians and French had surrounded him, and were concealed\r\nbehind trees and in gullies, and kept a constant fire upon the English;\r\nand that they saw the English falling in heaps; and if they did not take\r\nthe river, which was the only gap, and make their escape, there would\r\nnot be one man left alive before sundown. Some time after this, I heard\r\na number of scalp-halloos, and saw a company of Indians and French\r\ncoming in. I observed they had a great number of bloody scalps,\r\ngrenadiers' caps, British canteens, bayonets, etc., with them. They\r\nbrought the news that Braddock was defeated. After that another company\r\ncame in, which appeared to be about one hundred, and chiefly Indians;\r\nand it seemed to me that almost every one of this company was carrying\r\nscalps. After this came another company with a number of wagon-horses,\r\nand also a great many scalps. Those that were coming in and those that\r\nhad arrived kept a constant firing of small arms, and also the great\r\nguns in the fort, which were accompanied with the most hideous shouts\r\nand yells from all quarters, so that it appeared to me as though the\r\ninfernal regions had broke loose.\"\r\n\r\n\"About sundown I beheld a small party coming in with about a dozen\r\nprisoners, stripped naked, with their hands tied behind their backs and\r\ntheir faces and part of their bodies blacked; these prisoners they\r\nburned to death on the bank of Alleghany River, opposite the fort. I\r\nstood on the fort wall until I beheld them begin to burn one of these\r\nmen; they had him tied to a stake, and kept touching him with\r\nfirebrands, red-hot irons, etc., and he screaming in a most doleful\r\nmanner, the Indians in the meantime yelling like infernal spirits. As\r\nthis scene appeared too shocking for me to behold, I retired to my\r\nlodging, both sore and sorry. When I came into my lodgings I saw\r\nRussel's _Seven Sermons_, which they had brought from the field of\r\nbattle, which a Frenchman made a present of to me.\"\r\n\r\nThe loss of the French was slight, but fell chiefly on the officers,\r\nthree of whom were killed, and four wounded. Of the regular soldiers,\r\nall but four escaped untouched. The Canadians suffered still less in\r\nproportion to their numbers, only five of them being hurt. The Indians,\r\nwho won the victory, bore the principal loss. Of those from Canada,\r\ntwenty-seven were killed and wounded; while the casualties among the\r\nWestern tribes are not reported.[229] All of these last went off the\r\nnext morning with their plunder and scalps, leaving Contrecoeur in great\r\nanxiety lest the remnant of Braddock's troops, reinforced by the\r\ndivision under Dunbar, should attack him again. His doubts would have\r\nvanished had he known the condition of his defeated enemy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 229: _Liste des Officiers, Soldats, Miliciens, et Sauvages de\r\nCanada qui out été tués et blessés le 9 Juillet, 1755_.]\r\n\r\nIn the pain and languor of a mortal wound, Braddock showed unflinching\r\nresolution. His bearers stopped with him at a favorable spot beyond the\r\nMonongahela; and here he hoped to maintain his position till the arrival\r\nof Dunbar. By the efforts of the officers about a hundred men were\r\ncollected around him; but to keep them there was impossible. Within an\r\nhour they abandoned him, and fled like the rest. Gage, however,\r\nsucceeded in rallying about eighty beyond the other fording-place; and\r\nWashington, on an order from Braddock, spurred his jaded horse towards\r\nthe camp of Dunbar to demand wagons, provisions, and hospital stores.\r\n\r\nFright overcame fatigue. The fugitives toiled on all night, pursued by\r\nspectres of horror and despair; hearing still the war-whoops and the\r\nshrieks; possessed with the one thought of escape from the wilderness of\r\ndeath. In the morning some order was restored. Braddock was placed on a\r\nhorse; then, the pain being insufferable, he was carried on a litter,\r\nCaptain Orme having bribed the carriers by the promise of a guinea and a\r\nbottle of rum apiece. Early in the succeeding night, such as had not\r\nfainted on the way reached the deserted farm of Gist. Here they met\r\nwagons and provisions, with a detachment of soldiers sent by Dunbar,\r\nwhose camp was six miles farther on; and Braddock ordered them to go to\r\nthe relief of the stragglers left behind.\r\n\r\nAt noon of that day a number of wagoners and packhorse-drivers had come\r\nto Dunbar's camp with wild tidings of rout and ruin. More fugitives\r\nfollowed; and soon after a wounded officer was brought in upon a sheet.\r\nThe drums beat to arms. The camp was in commotion; and many soldiers and\r\nteamsters took to flight, in spite of the sentinels, who tried in vain\r\nto stop them.[230] There was a still more disgraceful scene on the next\r\nday, after Braddock, with the wreck of his force, had arrived. Orders\r\nwere given to destroy such of the wagons, stores, and ammunition as\r\ncould not be carried back at once to Fort Cumberland. Whether Dunbar or\r\nthe dying General gave these orders is not clear; but it is certain that\r\nthey were executed with shameful alacrity. More than a hundred wagons\r\nwere burned; cannon, coehorns, and shells were burst or buried; barrels\r\nof gunpowder were staved, and the contents thrown into a brook;\r\nprovisions were scattered through the woods and swamps. Then the whole\r\ncommand began its retreat over the mountains to Fort Cumberland, sixty\r\nmiles distant. This proceeding, for which, in view of the condition of\r\nBraddock, Dunbar must be held answerable, excited the utmost\r\nindignation among the colonists. If he could not advance, they thought,\r\nhe might at least have fortified himself and held his ground till the\r\nprovinces could send him help; thus covering the frontier, and holding\r\nFrench war-parties in check.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 230: _Depositions of Matthew Laird, Michael Hoover, and Jacob\r\nHoover, Wagoners_, in _Colonial Records of Pa._, VI. 482.]\r\n\r\nBraddock's last moment was near. Orme, who, though himself severely\r\nwounded, was with him till his death, told Franklin that he was totally\r\nsilent all the first day, and at night said only, \"Who would have\r\nthought it?\" that all the next day he was again silent, till at last he\r\nmuttered, \"We shall better know how to deal with them another time,\" and\r\ndied a few minutes after. He had nevertheless found breath to give\r\norders at Gist's for the succor of the men who had dropped on the road.\r\nIt is said, too, that in his last hours \"he could not bear the sight of\r\na red coat,\" but murmured praises of \"the blues,\" or Virginians, and\r\nsaid that he hoped he should live to reward them.[231] He died at about\r\neight o'clock in the evening of Sunday, the thirteenth. Dunbar had begun\r\nhis retreat that morning, and was then encamped near the Great Meadows.\r\nOn Monday the dead commander was buried in the road; and men, horses,\r\nand wagons passed over his grave, effacing every sign of it, lest the\r\nIndians should find and mutilate the body.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 231: _Bolling to his Son, 13 Aug. 1755_. Bolling was a\r\nVirginian gentleman whose son was at school in England.]\r\n\r\nColonel James Innes, commanding at Fort Cumberland, where a crowd of\r\ninvalids with soldiers' wives and other women had been left when the\r\nexpedition marched, heard of the defeat, only two days after it\r\nhappened, from a wagoner who had fled from the field on horseback. He at\r\nonce sent a note of six lines to Lord Fairfax: \"I have this moment\r\nreceived the most melancholy news of the defeat of our troops, the\r\nGeneral killed, and numbers of our officers; our whole artillery taken.\r\nIn short, the account I have received is so very bad, that as, please\r\nGod, I intend to make a stand here, 'tis highly necessary to raise the\r\nmilitia everywhere to defend the frontiers.\" A boy whom he sent out on\r\nhorseback met more fugitives, and came back on the fourteenth with\r\nreports as vague and disheartening as the first. Innes sent them to\r\nDinwiddie.[232] Some days after, Dunbar and his train arrived in\r\nmiserable disorder, and Fort Cumberland was turned into a hospital for\r\nthe shattered fragments of a routed and ruined army.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 232: _Innes to Dinwiddie, 14 July, 1755_.]\r\n\r\nOn the sixteenth a letter was brought in haste to one Buchanan at\r\nCarlisle, on the Pennsylvanian frontier:--\r\n\r\n     Sir,--I thought it proper to let you know that I was in the battle\r\n     where we were defeated. And we had about eleven hundred and fifty\r\n     private men, besides officers and others. And we were attacked the\r\n     ninth day about twelve o'clock, and held till about three in the\r\n     afternoon, and then we were forced to retreat, when I suppose we\r\n     might bring off about three hundred whole men, besides a vast many\r\n     wounded. Most of our officers were either wounded or killed;\r\n     General Braddock is wounded, but I hope not mortal; and Sir John\r\n     Sinclair and many others, but I hope not mortal. All the train is\r\n     cut off in a manner. Sir Peter Halket and his son, Captain Polson,\r\n     Captain Gethan, Captain Rose, Captain Tatten killed, and many\r\n     others. Captain Ord of the train is wounded, but I hope not mortal.\r\n     We lost all our artillery entirely, and everything else.\r\n\r\n     To Mr. John Smith and Buchannon, and give it to the next post, and\r\n     let him show this to Mr. George Gibson in Lancaster, and Mr.\r\n     Bingham, at the sign of the Ship, and you'll oblige,\r\n\r\n     Yours to command,\r\n\r\n     JOHN CAMPBELL, _Messenger_.[233]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 233: _Colonial Records of Pa._, VI. 481.]\r\n\r\nThe evil tidings quickly reached Philadelphia, where such confidence had\r\nprevailed that certain over-zealous persons had begun to collect money\r\nfor fireworks to celebrate the victory. Two of these, brother physicians\r\nnamed Bond, came to Franklin and asked him to subscribe; but the sage\r\nlooked doubtful. \"Why, the devil!\" said one of them, \"you surely don't\r\nsuppose the fort will not be taken?\" He reminded them that war is always\r\nuncertain; and the subscription was deferred.[234]The Governor laid the\r\nnews of the disaster before his Council, telling them at the same time\r\nthat his opponents in the Assembly would not believe it, and had\r\ninsulted him in the street for giving it currency.[235]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 234: _Autobiography of Franklin_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 235: _Colonial Records of Pa._, VI. 480.]\r\n\r\nDinwiddie remained tranquil at Williamsburg, sure that all would go\r\nwell. The brief note of Innes, forwarded by Lord Fairfax, first\r\ndisturbed his dream of triumph; but on second thought he took comfort.\r\n\"I am willing to think that account was from a deserter who, in a great\r\npanic, represented what his fears suggested. I wait with impatience for\r\nanother express from Fort Cumberland, which I expect will greatly\r\ncontradict the former.\" The news got abroad, and the slaves showed signs\r\nof excitement. \"The villany of the negroes on any emergency is what I\r\nalways feared,\" continues the Governor. \"An example of one or two at\r\nfirst may prevent these creatures entering into combinations and wicked\r\ndesigns.\"[236] And he wrote to Lord Halifax: \"The negro slaves have been\r\nvery audacious on the news of defeat on the Ohio. These poor creatures\r\nimagine the French will give them their freedom. We have too many here;\r\nbut I hope we shall be able to keep them in proper subjection.\" Suspense\r\ngrew intolerable. \"It's monstrous they should be so tardy and dilatory\r\nin sending down any farther account.\" He sent Major Colin Campbell for\r\nnews; when, a day or two later, a courier brought him two letters, one\r\nfrom Orme, and the other from Washington, both written at Fort\r\nCumberland on the eighteenth. The letter of Orme began thus: \"My dear\r\nGovernor, I am so extremely ill in bed with the wound I have received\r\nthat I am under the necessity of employing my friend Captain Dobson as\r\nmy scribe.\" Then he told the wretched story of defeat and humiliation.\r\n\"The officers were absolutely sacrificed by their unparalleled good\r\nbehavior; advancing before their men sometimes in bodies, and sometimes\r\nseparately, hoping by such an example to engage the soldiers to follow\r\nthem; but to no purpose. Poor Shirley was shot through the head, Captain\r\nMorris very much wounded. Mr. Washington had two horses shot under him,\r\nand his clothes shot through in several places; behaving the whole time\r\nwith the greatest courage and resolution.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 236: _Dinwiddie to Colonel Charles Carter, 18 July, 1755_.]\r\n\r\nWashington wrote more briefly, saying that, as Orme was giving a full\r\naccount of the affair, it was needless for him to repeat it. Like many\r\nothers in the fight, he greatly underrated the force of the enemy, which\r\nhe placed at three hundred, or about a third of the actual number,--a\r\nnatural error, as most of the assailants were invisible. \"Our poor\r\nVirginians behaved like men, and died like soldiers; for I believe that\r\nout of three companies that were there that day, scarce thirty were left\r\nalive. Captain Peronney and all his officers down to a corporal were\r\nkilled. Captain Polson shared almost as hard a fate, for only one of his\r\nescaped. In short, the dastardly behavior of the English soldiers\r\nexposed all those who were inclined to do their duty to almost certain\r\ndeath. It is imagined (I believe with great justice, too) that two\r\nthirds of both killed and wounded received their shots from our own\r\ncowardly dogs of soldiers, who gathered themselves into a body, contrary\r\nto orders, ten and twelve deep, would then level, fire, and shoot down\r\nthe men before them.\"[237]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 237: These extracts are taken from the two letters preserved\r\nin the Public Record Office, _America and West Indies_, LXXIV, LXXXII.]\r\n\r\nTo Orme, Dinwiddie replied: \"I read your letter with tears in my eyes;\r\nbut it gave me much pleasure to see your name at the bottom, and more so\r\nwhen I observed by the postscript that your wound is not dangerous. But\r\npray, dear sir, is it not possible by a second attempt to retrieve the\r\ngreat loss we have sustained? I presume the General's chariot is at the\r\nfort. In it you may come here, and my house is heartily at your command.\r\nPray take care of your valuable health; keep your spirits up, and I\r\ndoubt not of your recovery. My wife and girls join me in most sincere\r\nrespects and joy at your being so well, and I always am, with great\r\ntruth, dear friend, your affectionate humble servant.\"\r\n\r\nTo Washington he is less effusive, though he had known him much longer.\r\nHe begins, it is true, \"Dear Washington,\" and congratulates him on his\r\nescape; but soon grows formal, and asks: \"Pray, sir, with the number of\r\nthem remaining, is there no possibility of doing something on the other\r\nside of the mountains before the winter months? Surely you must mistake.\r\nColonel Dunbar will not march to winter-quarters in the middle of\r\nsummer, and leave the frontiers exposed to the invasions of the enemy!\r\nNo; he is a better officer, and I have a different opinion of him. I\r\nsincerely wish you health and happiness, and am, with great respect,\r\nsir, your obedient, humble servant.\"\r\n\r\nWashington's letter had contained the astonishing announcement that\r\nDunbar meant to abandon the frontier and march to Philadelphia.\r\nDinwiddie, much disturbed, at once wrote to that officer, though without\r\nbetraying any knowledge of his intention. \"Sir, the melancholy account\r\nof the defeat of our forces gave me a sensible and real concern\"--on\r\nwhich he enlarges for a while; then suddenly changes style: \"Dear\r\nColonel, is there no method left to retrieve the dishonor done to the\r\nBritish arms? As you now command all the forces that remain, are you not\r\nable, after a proper refreshment of your men, to make a second attempt?\r\nYou have four months now to come of the best weather of the year for\r\nsuch an expedition. What a fine field for honor will Colonel Dunbar have\r\nto confirm and establish his character as a brave officer.\" Then, after\r\nsuggesting plans of operation, and entering into much detail, the fervid\r\nGovernor concludes: \"It gives me great pleasure that under our great\r\nloss and misfortunes the command devolves on an officer of so great\r\nmilitary judgment and established character. With my sincere respect and\r\nhearty wishes for success to all your proceedings, I am, worthy sir,\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant.\"\r\n\r\nExhortation and flattery were lost on Dunbar. Dinwiddie received from\r\nhim in reply a short, dry note, dated on the first of August, and\r\nacquainting him that he should march for Philadelphia on the second.\r\nThis, in fact, he did, leaving the fort to be defended by invalids and a\r\nfew Virginians. \"I acknowledge,\" says Dinwiddie, \"I was not brought up\r\nto arms; but I think common sense would have prevailed not to leave the\r\nfrontiers exposed after having opened a road over the mountains to the\r\nOhio, by which the enemy can the more easily invade us.... Your great\r\ncolonel,\" he writes to Orme, \"is gone to a peaceful colony, and left our\r\nfrontiers open.... The whole conduct of Colonel Dunbar appears to me\r\nmonstrous.... To march off all the regulars, and leave the fort and\r\nfrontiers to be defended by four hundred sick and wounded, and the poor\r\nremains of our provincial forces, appears to me absurd.\"[238]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 238: Dinwiddie's view of Dunbar's conduct is fully justified\r\nby the letters of Shirley, Governor Morris, and Dunbar himself.]\r\n\r\nHe found some comfort from the burgesses, who gave him forty thousand\r\npounds, and would, he thinks, have given a hundred thousand if another\r\nattempt against Fort Duquesne had been set afoot. Shirley, too, whom the\r\ndeath of Braddock had made commander-in-chief, approved the Governor's\r\nplan of renewing offensive operations, and instructed Dunbar to that\r\neffect; ordering him, however, should they prove impracticable, to march\r\nfor Albany in aid of the Niagara expedition.[239] The order found him\r\nsafe in Philadelphia. Here he lingered for a while; then marched to join\r\nthe northern army, moving at a pace which made it certain that he could\r\nnot arrive in time to be of the least use.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 239: _Orders for Colonel Thomas Dunbar, 12 Aug. 1755_. These\r\nsupersede a previous order of August 6, by which Shirley had directed\r\nDunbar to march northward at once.]\r\n\r\nThus the frontier was left unguarded; and soon, as Dinwiddie had\r\nforeseen, there burst upon it a storm of blood and fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\n1755-1763\r\n\r\nRemoval of the Acadians\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the plan which the Duke of Cumberland had ordained and Braddock had\r\nannounced in the Council at Alexandria, four blows were to be struck at\r\nonce to force back the French boundaries, lop off the dependencies of\r\nCanada, and reduce her from a vast territory to a petty province. The\r\nfirst stroke had failed, and had shattered the hand of the striker; it\r\nremains to see what fortune awaited the others.\r\n\r\nIt was long since a project of purging Acadia of French influence had\r\ngerminated in the fertile mind of Shirley. We have seen in a former\r\nchapter the condition of that afflicted province. Several thousands of\r\nits inhabitants, wrought upon by intriguing agents of the French\r\nGovernment, taught by their priests that fidelity to King Louis was\r\ninseparable from fidelity to God, and that to swear allegiance to the\r\nBritish Crown was eternal perdition; threatened with plunder and death\r\nat the hands of the savages whom the ferocious missionary, Le Loutre,\r\nheld over them in terror,--had abandoned, sometimes willingly, but\r\noftener under constraint, the fields which they and their fathers had\r\ntilled, and crossing the boundary line of the Missaguash, had placed\r\nthemselves under the French flag planted on the hill of Beauséjour.[240]\r\nHere, or in the neighborhood, many of them had remained, wretched and\r\nhalf starved; while others had been transported to Cape Breton, Isle St.\r\nJean, or the coasts of the Gulf,--not so far, however, that they could\r\nnot on occasion be used to aid in an invasion of British Acadia.[241]\r\nThose of their countrymen who still lived under the British flag were\r\nchiefly the inhabitants of the district of Mines and of the valley of\r\nthe River Annapolis, who, with other less important settlements,\r\nnumbered a little more than nine thousand souls. We have shown already,\r\nby the evidence of the French themselves, that neither they nor their\r\nemigrant countrymen had been oppressed or molested in matters temporal\r\nor spiritual, but that the English authorities, recognizing their value\r\nas an industrious population, had labored to reconcile them to a change\r\nof rulers which on the whole was to their advantage. It has been shown\r\nalso how, with a heartless perfidy and a reckless disregard of their\r\nwelfare and safety, the French Government and its agents labored to keep\r\nthem hostile to the Crown of which it had acknowledged them to be\r\nsubjects. The result was, that though they did not, like their emigrant\r\ncountrymen, abandon their homes, they remained in a state of restless\r\ndisaffection, refused to supply English garrisons with provisions,\r\nexcept at most exorbitant rates, smuggled their produce to the French\r\nacross the line, gave them aid and intelligence, and sometimes disguised\r\nas Indians, robbed and murdered English settlers. By the new-fangled\r\nconstruction of the treaty of Utrecht which the French boundary\r\ncommissioners had devised,[242] more than half the Acadian peninsula,\r\nincluding nearly all the cultivated land and nearly all the population\r\nof French descent, was claimed as belonging to France, though England\r\nhad held possession of it more than forty years. Hence, according to the\r\npolitical ethics adopted at the time by both nations, it would be lawful\r\nfor France to reclaim it by force. England, on her part, it will be\r\nremembered, claimed vast tracts beyond the isthmus; and, on the same\r\npretext, held that she might rightfully seize them and capture\r\nBeauséjour, with the other French garrisons that guarded them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 240: See _ante_, Chapter 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 241: Rameau (_La France aux Colonies_, I. 63), estimates the\r\ntotal emigration from 1748 to 1755 at 8,600 souls,--which number seems\r\nmuch too large. This writer, though vehemently anti-English, gives the\r\nfollowing passage from a letter of a high French official: \"que les\r\nAcadiens émigrés et en grande misère comptaient se retirer à Québec et\r\ndemander des terres, mais il conviendrait mieux qu'ils restent où ils\r\nsont, afin d'avoir le voisinage de l'Acadie bien peuplé et défriché,\r\npour approvisionner l'Isle Royale [_Cape Breton_] et tomber en cas de\r\nguerre sur l'Acadie.\" Rameau, I. 133.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 242: _Supra_, p. 102.]\r\n\r\nOn the part of France, an invasion of the Acadian peninsula seemed more\r\nthan likely. Honor demanded of her that, having incited the Acadians to\r\ndisaffection, and so brought on them the indignation of the English\r\nauthorities, she should intervene to save them from the consequences.\r\nMoreover the loss of the Acadian peninsula had been gall and wormwood to\r\nher; and in losing it she had lost great material advantages. Its\r\npossession was necessary to connect Canada with the Island of Cape\r\nBreton and the fortress of Louisbourg. Its fertile fields and\r\nagricultural people would furnish subsistence to the troops and\r\ngarrisons in the French maritime provinces, now dependent on supplies\r\nillicitly brought by New England traders, and liable to be cut off in\r\ntime of war when they were needed most. The harbors of Acadia, too,\r\nwould be invaluable as naval stations from which to curb and threaten\r\nthe northern English colonies. Hence the intrigues so assiduously\r\npractised to keep the Acadians French at heart, and ready to throw off\r\nBritish rule at any favorable moment. British officers believed that\r\nshould a French squadron with a sufficient force of troops on board\r\nappear in the Bay of Fundy, the whole population on the Basin of Mines\r\nand along the Annapolis would rise in arms, and that the emigrants\r\nbeyond the isthmus, armed and trained by French officers, would come to\r\ntheir aid. This emigrant population, famishing in exile, looked back\r\nwith regret to the farms they had abandoned; and, prevented as they were\r\nby Le Loutre and his colleagues from making their peace with the\r\nEnglish, they would, if confident of success, have gladly joined an\r\ninvading force to regain their homes by reconquering Acadia for Louis\r\nXV. In other parts of the continent it was the interest of France to put\r\noff hostilities; if Acadia alone had been in question, it would have\r\nbeen her interest to precipitate them.\r\n\r\nHer chances of success were good. The French could at any time send\r\ntroops from Louisbourg or Quebec to join those maintained upon the\r\nisthmus; and they had on their side of the lines a force of militia and\r\nIndians amounting to about two thousand, while the Acadians within the\r\npeninsula had about an equal number of fighting men who, while calling\r\nthemselves neutrals, might be counted on to join the invaders. The\r\nEnglish were in no condition to withstand such an attack. Their regular\r\ntroops were scattered far and wide through the province, and were\r\nnowhere more than equal to the local requirement; while of militia,\r\nexcept those of Halifax, they had few or none whom they dared to trust.\r\nTheir fort at Annapolis was weak and dilapidated, and their other posts\r\nwere mere stockades. The strongest place in Acadia was the French fort\r\nof Beauséjour, in which the English saw a continual menace. Their\r\napprehensions were well grounded. Duquesne, governor of Canada, wrote to\r\nLe Loutre, who virtually shared the control of Beauséjour with Vergor,\r\nits commandant: \"I invite both yourself and M. Vergor to devise a\r\nplausible pretext for attacking them [_the English_] vigorously.\"[243]\r\nThree weeks after this letter was written, Lawrence, governor of Nova\r\nScotia, wrote to Shirley from Halifax: \"Being well informed that the\r\nFrench have designs of encroaching still farther upon His Majesty's\r\nrights in this province, and that they propose, the moment they have\r\nrepaired the fortifications of Louisbourg, to attack our fort at\r\nChignecto [_Fort Lawrence_], I think it high time to make some effort to\r\ndrive them from the north side of the Bay of Fundy.\"[244] This letter\r\nwas brought to Boston by Lieutenant-Colonel Monckton, who was charged by\r\nLawrence to propose to Shirley the raising of two thousand men in New\r\nEngland for the attack of Beauséjour and its dependent forts. Almost at\r\nthe moment when Lawrence was writing these proposals to Shirley, Shirley\r\nwas writing with the same object to Lawrence, enclosing a letter from\r\nSir Thomas Robinson, concerning which he said: \"I construe the contents\r\nto be orders to us to act in concert for taking _any_ advantages to\r\ndrive the French of Canada out of Nova Scotia. If that is your sense of\r\nthem, and your honor will be pleased to let me know whether you want any\r\nand what assistance to enable you to execute the orders, I will endeavor\r\nto send you such assistance from this province as you shall want.\"[245]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 243: _Duquesne à Le Loutre, 15 Oct. 1754_; extract in _Public\r\nDocuments of Nova Scotia_, 239.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 244: _Lawrence to Shirley, 5 Nov. 1754. Instructions of\r\nLawrence to Monckton, 1 Nov. 1754_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 245: _Shirley to Lawrence, 7 Nov. 1754_.]\r\n\r\nThe letter of Sir Thomas Robinson, of which a duplicate had already been\r\nsent to Lawrence, was written in answer to one of Shirley informing the\r\nMinister that the Indians of Nova Scotia, prompted by the French, were\r\nabout to make an attack on all the English settlements east of the\r\nKennebec; whereupon Robinson wrote: \"You will without doubt have given\r\nimmediate intelligence thereof to Colonel Lawrence, and will have\r\nconcerted the properest measures with him for taking all possible\r\nadvantage in Nova Scotia itself from the absence of those Indians, in\r\ncase Mr. Lawrence shall have force enough to attack the forts erected by\r\nthe French in those parts, without exposing the English settlements; and\r\nI am particularly to acquaint you that if you have not already entered\r\ninto such a concert with Colonel Lawrence, it is His Majesty's pleasure\r\nthat you should immediately proceed thereupon.\"[246]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 246: _Robinson to Shirley, 5 July, 1754_.]\r\n\r\nThe Indian raid did not take place; but not the less did Shirley and\r\nLawrence find in the Minister's letter their authorization for the\r\nattack of Beauséjour. Shirley wrote to Robinson that the expulsion of\r\nthe French from the forts on the isthmus was a necessary measure of\r\nself-defence; that they meant to seize the whole country as far as Mines\r\nBasin, and probably as far as Annapolis, to supply their Acadian rebels\r\nwith land; that of these they had, without reckoning Indians, fourteen\r\nhundred fighting men on or near the isthmus, and two hundred and fifty\r\nmore on the St. John, with whom, aided by the garrison of Beauséjour,\r\nthey could easily take Fort Lawrence; that should they succeed in this,\r\nthe whole Acadian population would rise in arms, and the King would lose\r\nNova Scotia. We should anticipate them, concludes Shirley, and strike\r\nthe first blow.[247]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 247: _Shirley to Robinson, 8 Dec. 1754. Ibid., 24 Jan. 1755_.\r\nThe Record Office contains numerous other letters of Shirley on the\r\nsubject. \"I am obliged to your Honor for communicating to me the French\r\nMémoire, which, with other reasons, puts it out of doubt that the French\r\nare determined to begin an offensive war on the peninsula as soon as\r\never they shall think themselves strengthened enough to venture up it,\r\nand that they have thoughts of attempting it in the ensuing spring. I\r\nenclose your Honor extracts from two letters from Annapolis Royal, which\r\nshow that the French inhabitants are in expectation of its being begun\r\nin the spring.\" _Shirley to Lawrence, 6 Jan. 1755_.]\r\n\r\nHe opened his plans to his Assembly in secret session, and found them of\r\none mind with himself. Preparation was nearly complete, and the men\r\nraised for the expedition, before the Council at Alexandria, recognized\r\nit as a part of a plan of the summer campaign.\r\n\r\nThe French fort of Beauséjour, mounted on its hill between the marshes\r\nof Missaguash and Tantemar, was a regular work, pentagonal in form, with\r\nsolid earthern ramparts, bomb-proofs, and an armament of twenty-four\r\ncannon and one mortar. The commandant, Duchambon de Vergor, a captain in\r\nthe colony regulars, was a dull man of no education, of stuttering\r\nspeech, unpleasing countenance, and doubtful character. He owed his\r\nplace to the notorious Intendant, Bigot, who it is said, was in his debt\r\nfor disreputable service in an affair of gallantry, and who had ample\r\nmeans of enabling his friends to enrich themselves by defrauding the\r\nKing. Beauséjour was one of those plague-spots of official corruption\r\nwhich dotted the whole surface of New France. Bigot, sailing for Europe\r\nin the summer of 1754, wrote thus to his confederate: \"Profit by your\r\nplace, my dear Vergor; clip and cut--you are free to do what you\r\nplease--so that you can come soon to join me in France and buy an estate\r\nnear me.\"[248] Vergor did not neglect his opportunities. Supplies in\r\ngreat quantities were sent from Quebec for the garrison and the emigrant\r\nAcadians. These last got but a small part of them. Vergor and his\r\nconfederates sent the rest back to Quebec, or else to Louisbourg, and\r\nsold them for their own profit to the King's agents there, who were\r\nalso in collusion with him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 248: _Mémoires sur le Canada, 1749-1760_. This letter is also\r\nmentioned in another contemporary document, _Mémoire sur les Fraudes\r\ncommises dans la Colonie_.]\r\n\r\nVergor, however, did not reign alone. Le Loutre, by force of energy,\r\ncapacity, and passionate vehemence, held him in some awe, and divided\r\nhis authority. The priest could count on the support of Duquesne, who\r\nhad found, says a contemporary, that \"he promised more than he could\r\nperform, and that he was a knave,\" but who nevertheless felt compelled\r\nto rely upon him for keeping the Acadians on the side of France. There\r\nwas another person in the fort worthy of notice. This was Thomas Pichon,\r\ncommissary of stores, a man of education and intelligence, born in\r\nFrance of an English mother. He was now acting the part of a traitor,\r\ncarrying on a secret correspondence with the commandant of Fort\r\nLawrence, and acquainting him with all that passed at Beauséjour. It was\r\npartly from this source that the hostile designs of the French became\r\nknown to the authorities of Halifax, and more especially the proceedings\r\nof \"Moses,\" by which name Pichon always designated Le Loutre, because he\r\npretended to have led the Acadians from the land of bondage.[249]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 249: Pichon, called also Tyrrell from the name of his mother,\r\nwas author of _Genuine Letters and Memoirs relating to Cape Breton_,--a\r\nbook of some value. His papers are preserved at Halifax, and some of\r\nthem are printed in the _Public Documents of Nova Scotia_.]\r\n\r\nThese exiles, who cannot be called self-exiled, in view of the\r\noutrageous means used to force most of them from their homes, were in a\r\ndeplorable condition. They lived in constant dread of Le Loutre, backed\r\nby Vergor and his soldiers. The savage missionary, bad as he was, had in\r\nhim an ingredient of honest fanaticism, both national and religious;\r\nthough hatred of the English held a large share in it. He would gladly,\r\nif he could, have forced the Acadians into a permanent settlement on the\r\nFrench side of the line, not out of love for them, but in the interest\r\nof the cause with which he had identified his own ambition. His efforts\r\nhad failed. There was not land enough for their subsistence and that of\r\nthe older settlers; and the suffering emigrants pined more and more for\r\ntheir deserted farms. Thither he was resolved that they should not\r\nreturn. \"If you go,\" he told them, \"you will have neither priests nor\r\nsacraments, but will die like miserable wretches.\"[250] The assertion\r\nwas false. Priests and sacraments had never been denied them. It is\r\ntrue that Daudin, priest of Pisiquid, had lately been sent to Halifax\r\nfor using insolent language to the commandant, threatening him with an\r\ninsurrection of the inhabitants, and exciting them to sedition; but on\r\nhis promise to change conduct, he was sent back to his parishioners.[251]\r\nVergor sustained Le Loutre, and threatened to put in irons any of the\r\nexiles who talked of going back to the English. Some of them bethought\r\nthemselves of an appeal to Duquesne, and drew up a petition asking leave\r\nto return home. Le Loutre told the signers that if they did not efface\r\ntheir marks from the paper they should have neither sacraments in this\r\nlife nor heaven in the next. He nevertheless allowed two of them to go\r\nto Quebec as deputies, writing at the same time to the Governor, that\r\nhis mind might be duly prepared. Duquesne replied: \"I think that the\r\ntwo rascals of deputies whom you sent me will not soon recover from the\r\nfright I gave them, notwithstanding the emollient I administered after\r\nmy reprimand; and since I told them that they were indebted to you for\r\nnot being allowed to rot in a dungeon, they have promised me to comply\r\nwith your wishes.\"[252]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 250: _Pichon to Captain Scott, 14 Oct. 1754_, in _Public\r\nDocuments of Nova Scotia_, 229.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 251: _Public Documents of Nova Scotia_, 223, 224, 226, 227,\r\n238.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 252: _Public Documents of Nova Scotia_, 239.]\r\n\r\nAn entire heartlessness marked the dealings of the French authorities\r\nwith the Acadians. They were treated as mere tools of policy, to be\r\nused, broken, and flung away. Yet, in using them, the sole condition of\r\ntheir efficiency was neglected. The French Government, cheated of\r\nenormous sums by its own ravenous agents, grudged the cost of sending a\r\nsingle regiment to the Acadian border. Thus unsupported, the Acadians\r\nremained in fear and vacillation, aiding the French but feebly, though a\r\nceaseless annoyance and menace to the English.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of affairs at Beauséjour while Shirley and Lawrence\r\nwere planning its destruction. Lawrence had empowered his agent,\r\nMonckton, to draw without limit on two Boston merchants, Apthorp and\r\nHancock. Shirley, as commander-in-chief of the province of\r\nMassachusetts, commissioned John Winslow to raise two thousand\r\nvolunteers. Winslow was sprung from the early governors of Plymouth\r\ncolony; but, though well-born, he was ill-educated, which did not\r\nprevent him from being both popular and influential. He had strong\r\nmilitary inclinations, had led a company of his own raising in the\r\nluckless attack on Carthagena, had commanded the force sent in the\r\npreceding summer to occupy the Kennebec, and on various other occasions\r\nhad left his Marshfield farm to serve his country. The men enlisted\r\nreadily at his call, and were formed into a regiment, of which Shirley\r\nmade himself the nominal colonel. It had two battalions, of which\r\nWinslow, as lieutenant-colonel, commanded the first, and George Scott\r\nthe second, both under the orders of Monckton. Country villages far and\r\nnear, from the western borders of the Connecticut to uttermost Cape Cod,\r\nlent soldiers to the new regiment. The muster-rolls preserve their\r\nnames, vocations, birthplaces, and abode. Obadiah, Nehemiah, Jedediah,\r\nJonathan, Ebenezer, Joshua, and the like Old Testament names abound upon\r\nthe list. Some are set down as \"farmers,\" \"yeomen,\" or \"husbandmen;\"\r\nothers as \"shopkeepers,\" others as \"fishermen,\" and many as \"laborers;\"\r\nwhile a great number were handicraftsmen of various trades, from\r\nblacksmiths to wig-makers. They mustered at Boston early in April, where\r\nclothing, haversacks, and blankets were served out to them at the charge\r\nof the King; and the crooked streets of the New England capital were\r\nfilled with staring young rustics. On the next Saturday the following\r\nmandate went forth: \"The men will behave very orderly on the Sabbath\r\nDay, and either stay on board their transports, or else go to church,\r\nand not stroll up and down the streets.\" The transports, consisting of\r\nabout forty sloops and schooners, lay at Long Wharf; and here on Monday\r\na grand review took place,--to the gratification, no doubt, of a\r\npopulace whose amusements were few. All was ready except the muskets,\r\nwhich were expected from England, but did not come. Hence the delay of a\r\nmonth, threatening to ruin the enterprise. When Shirley returned from\r\nAlexandria he found, to his disgust, that the transports still lay at\r\nthe wharf where he had left them on his departure.[253] The muskets\r\narrived at length, and the fleet sailed on the twenty-second of May.\r\nThree small frigates, the \"Success,\" the \"Mermaid,\" and the \"Siren,\"\r\ncommanded by the ex-privateersman, Captain Rous, acted as convoy; and on\r\nthe twenty-sixth the whole force safely reached Annapolis. Thence after\r\nsome delay they sailed up the Bay of Fundy, and at sunset on the first\r\nof June anchored within five miles of the hill of Beauséjour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 253: _Shirley to Robinson, 20 June, 1755._]\r\n\r\nAt two o'clock on the next morning a party of Acadians from Chipody\r\nroused Vergor with the news. In great alarm, he sent a messenger to\r\nLouisbourg to beg for help, and ordered all the fighting men of the\r\nneighborhood to repair to the fort. They counted in all between twelve\r\nand fifteen hundred;[254] but they had no appetite for war. The force\r\nof the invaders daunted them; and the hundred and sixty regulars who\r\nformed the garrison of Beauséjour were too few to revive their\r\nconfidence. Those of them who had crossed from the English side dreaded\r\nwhat might ensue should they be caught in arms; and, to prepare an\r\nexcuse beforehand, they begged Vergor to threaten them with punishment\r\nif they disobeyed his order. He willingly complied, promised to have\r\nthem killed if they did not fight, and assured them at the same time\r\nthat the English could never take the fort.[255] Three hundred of them\r\nthereupon joined the garrison, and the rest, hiding their families in\r\nthe woods, prepared to wage guerilla war against the invaders.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 254: _Mémoires sur le Canada, 1749-1760._ An English document,\r\n_State of the English and French Forts in Nova Scotia_, says 1,200 to\r\n1,400.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 255: _Mémoires sur le Canada, 1749-1760._]\r\n\r\nMonckton, with all his force, landed unopposed, and encamped at night on\r\nthe fields around Fort Lawrence, whence he could contemplate Fort\r\nBeauséjour at his ease. The regulars of the English garrison joined the\r\nNew England men; and then, on the morning of the fourth, they marched to\r\nthe attack. Their course lay along the south bank of the Missaguash to\r\nwhere it was crossed by a bridge called Pont-à-Buot. This bridge had\r\nbeen destroyed; and on the farther bank there was a large blockhouse and\r\na breastwork of timber defended by four hundred regulars, Acadians, and\r\nIndians. They lay silent and unseen till the head of the column reached\r\nthe opposite bank; then raised a yell and opened fire, causing some\r\nloss. Three field-pieces were brought up, the defenders were driven out,\r\nand a bridge was laid under a spattering fusillade from behind bushes,\r\nwhich continued till the English had crossed the stream. Without further\r\nopposition, they marched along the road to Beauséjour, and, turning to\r\nthe right, encamped among the woody hills half a league from the fort.\r\nThat night there was a grand illumination, for Vergor set fire to the\r\nchurch and all the houses outside the ramparts.[256]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 256: Winslow, _Journal and Letter Book. Mémoires sur le\r\nCanada, 1749-1760_. Letters from officers on the spot in _Boston Evening\r\nPost_ and _Boston News Letter. Journal of Surgeon John Thomas_.]\r\n\r\nThe English spent some days in preparing their camp and reconnoitring\r\nthe ground. Then Scott, with five hundred provincials, seized upon a\r\nridge within easy range of the works. An officer named Vannes came out\r\nto oppose him with a hundred and eighty men, boasting that he would do\r\ngreat things; but on seeing the enemy, quietly returned, to become the\r\nlaughing-stock of the garrison. The fort fired furiously, but with\r\nlittle effect. In the night of the thirteenth, Winslow, with a part of\r\nhis own battalion, relieved Scott, and planted in the trenches two small\r\nmortars, brought to the camp on carts. On the next day they opened fire.\r\nOne of them was disabled by the French cannon, but Captain Hazen brought\r\nup two more, of larger size, on ox-wagons; and, in spite of heavy rain,\r\nthe fire was brisk on both sides.\r\n\r\nCaptain Rous, on board his ship in the harbor, watched the bombardment\r\nwith great interest. Having occasion to write to Winslow, he closed his\r\nletter in a facetious strain. \"I often hear of your success in plunder,\r\nparticularly a coach.[257] I hope you have some fine horses for it, at\r\nleast four, to draw it, that it may be said a New England colonel [_rode\r\nin_] his coach and four in Nova Scotia. If you have any good\r\nsaddle-horses in your stable, I should be obliged to you for one to ride\r\nround the ship's deck on for exercise, for I am not likely to have any\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 257: \"11 June. Capt. Adams went with a Company of Raingers,\r\nand Returned at 11 Clock with a Coach and Sum other Plunder.\" _Journal\r\nof John Thomas_.]\r\n\r\nWithin the fort there was little promise of a strong defence. Le Loutre,\r\nit is true, was to be seen in his shirt-sleeves, with a pipe in his\r\nmouth, directing the Acadians in their work of strengthening the\r\nfortifications.[258] They, on their part, thought more of escape than of\r\nfighting. Some of them vainly begged to be allowed to go home; others\r\nwent off without leave,--which was not difficult, as only one side of\r\nthe place was attacked. Even among the officers there were some in whom\r\ninterest was stronger than honor, and who would rather rob the King than\r\ndie for him. The general discouragement was redoubled when, on the\r\nfourteenth, a letter came from the commandant of Louisbourg to say that\r\nhe could send no help, as British ships blocked the way. On the morning\r\nof the sixteenth, a mischance befell, recorded in these words in the\r\ndiary of Surgeon John Thomas: \"One of our large shells fell through what\r\nthey called their bomb-proof, where a number of their officers were\r\nsitting, killed six of them dead, and one Ensign Hay, which the Indians\r\nhad took prisoner a few days agone and carried to the fort.\" The party\r\nwas at breakfast when the unwelcome visitor burst in. Just opposite was\r\na second bomb-proof, where was Vergor himself, with Le Loutre, another\r\npriest, and several officers, who felt that they might at any time share\r\nthe same fate. The effect was immediate. The English, who had not yet\r\ngot a single cannon into position, saw to their surprise a white flag\r\nraised on the rampart. Some officers of the garrison protested against\r\nsurrender; and Le Loutre, who thought that he had everything to fear at\r\nthe hands of the victors, exclaimed that it was better to be buried\r\nunder the ruins of the fort than to give it up; but all was in vain, and\r\nthe valiant Vannes was sent out to propose terms of capitulation. They\r\nwere rejected, and others offered, to the following effect: the garrison\r\nto march out with the honors of war and to be sent to Louisbourg at the\r\ncharge of the King of England, but not to bear arms in America for the\r\nspace of six months. The Acadians to be pardoned the part they had just\r\nborne in the defence, \"seeing that they had been compelled to take arms\r\non pain of death.\" Confusion reigned all day at Beauséjour. The Acadians\r\nwent home loaded with plunder. The French officers were so busy in\r\ndrinking and pillaging that they could hardly be got away to sign the\r\ncapitulation. At the appointed hour, seven in the evening, Scott marched\r\nin with a body of provincials, raised the British flag on the ramparts,\r\nand saluted it by a general discharge of the French cannon, while Vergor\r\nas a last act of hospitality gave a supper to the officers.[259]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 258: _Journal of Pichon_, cited by Beamish Murdoch.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 259: On the capture of Beauséjour, _Mémoires sur le Canada,\r\n1749-1760_; Pichon, _Cape Breton_, 318; _Journal of Pichon_, cited by\r\nMurdoch; and the English accounts already mentioned.]\r\n\r\nLe Loutre was not to be found; he had escaped in disguise with his box\r\nof papers, and fled to Baye Verte to join his brother missionary,\r\nManach. Thence he made his way to Quebec, where the Bishop received him\r\nwith reproaches. He soon embarked for France; but the English captured\r\nhim on the way, and kept him eight years in Elizabeth Castle, on the\r\nIsland of Jersey. Here on one occasion a soldier on guard made a dash at\r\nthe father, tried to stab him with his bayonet, and was prevented with\r\ngreat difficulty. He declared that, when he was with his regiment in\r\nAcadia, he had fallen into the hands of Le Loutre, and narrowly escaped\r\nbeing scalped alive, the missionary having doomed him to this fate, and\r\nwith his own hand drawn a knife round his head as a beginning of the\r\noperation. The man swore so fiercely that he would have his revenge,\r\nthat the officer in command transferred him to another post.[260]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 260: Knox, _Campaigns in North America_, I. 114, _note_. Knox,\r\nwho was stationed in Nova Scotia, says that Le Loutre left behind him \"a\r\nmost remarkable character for inhumanity.\"]\r\n\r\nThroughout the siege, the Acadians outside the fort, aided by Indians,\r\nhad constantly attacked the English, but were always beaten off with\r\nloss. There was an affair of this kind on the morning of the surrender,\r\nduring which a noted Micmac chief was shot, and being brought into the\r\ncamp, recounted the losses of his tribe; \"after which, and taking a dram\r\nor two, he quickly died,\" writes Winslow in his Journal.\r\n\r\nFort Gaspereau, at Baye Verte, twelve miles distant, was summoned by\r\nletter to surrender. Villeray, its commandant, at once complied; and\r\nWinslow went with a detachment to take possession.[261] Nothing remained\r\nbut to occupy the French post at the mouth of the St. John. Captain\r\nRous, relieved at last from inactivity, was charged with the task; and\r\non the thirtieth he appeared off the harbor, manned his boats, and rowed\r\nfor shore. The French burned their fort, and withdrew beyond his\r\nreach.[262] A hundred and fifty Indians, suddenly converted from enemies\r\nto pretended friends, stood on the strand, firing their guns into the\r\nair as a salute, and declaring themselves brothers of the English. All\r\nAcadia was now in British hands. Fort Beausejour became Fort\r\nCumberland,--the second fort in America that bore the name of the royal\r\nDuke.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 261: Winslow, _Journal. Villeray au Ministre, 20 Sept. 1755._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 262: _Drucour au Ministre, 1 Déc. 1755._]\r\n\r\nThe defence had been of the feeblest. Two years later, on pressing\r\ndemands from Versailles, Vergor was brought to trial, as was also\r\nVilleray. The Governor, Vaudreuil, and the Intendant, Bigot, who had\r\nreturned to Canada, were in the interest of the chief defendant. The\r\ncourt-martial was packed; adverse evidence was shuffled out of sight;\r\nand Vergor, acquitted and restored to his rank, lived to inflict on New\r\nFrance another and a greater injury.[263]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 263: _Memoire sur les Fraudes commises dans la Colonie_, 1759.\r\n_Memoires sur le Canada_, 1749-1760.]\r\n\r\nNow began the first act of a deplorable drama. Monckton, with his small\r\nbody of regulars, had pitched their tents under the walls of\r\nBeauséjour. Winslow and Scott, with the New England troops, lay not far\r\noff. There was little intercourse between the two camps. The British\r\nofficers bore themselves towards those of the provincials with a\r\nsupercilious coldness common enough on their part throughout the war.\r\nJuly had passed in what Winslow calls \"an indolent manner,\" with prayers\r\nevery day in the Puritan camp, when, early in August, Monckton sent for\r\nhim, and made an ominous declaration. \"The said Monckton was so free as\r\nto acquaint me that it was determined to remove all the French\r\ninhabitants out of the province, and that he should send for all the\r\nadult males from Tantemar, Chipody, Aulac, Beauséjour, and Baye Verte to\r\nread the Governor's orders; and when that was done, was determined to\r\nretain them all prisoners in the fort. And this is the first conference\r\nof a public nature I have had with the colonel since the reduction of\r\nBeauséjour; and I apprehend that no officer of either corps has been\r\nmade more free with.\"\r\n\r\nMonckton sent accordingly to all the neighboring settlements, commanding\r\nthe male inhabitants to meet him at Beauséjour. Scarcely a third part of\r\ntheir number obeyed. These arrived on the tenth, and were told to stay\r\nall night under the guns of the fort. What then befell them will appear\r\nfrom an entry in the diary of Winslow under date of August eleventh:\r\n\"This day was one extraordinary to the inhabitants of Tantemar, Oueskak,\r\nAulac, Baye Verte, Beauséjour, and places adjacent; the male\r\ninhabitants, or the principal of them, being collected together in Fort\r\nCumberland to hear the sentence, which determined their property, from\r\nthe Governor and Council of Halifax; which was that they were declared\r\nrebels, their lands, goods, and chattels forfeited to the Crown, and\r\ntheir bodies to be imprisoned. Upon which the gates of the fort were\r\nshut, and they all confined, to the amount of four hundred men and\r\nupwards.\" Parties were sent to gather more, but caught very few, the\r\nrest escaping to the woods.\r\n\r\nSome of the prisoners were no doubt among those who had joined the\r\ngarrison at Beauséjour, and had been pardoned for doing so by the terms\r\nof the capitulation. It was held, however, that, though forgiven this\r\nspecial offence, they were not exempted from the doom that had gone\r\nforth against the great body of their countrymen. We must look closely\r\nat the motives and execution of this stern sentence.\r\n\r\nAt any time up to the spring of 1755 the emigrant Acadians were free to\r\nreturn to their homes on taking the ordinary oath of allegiance required\r\nof British subjects. The English authorities of Halifax used every means\r\nto persuade them to do so; yet the greater part refused. This was due\r\nnot only to Le Loutre and his brother priests, backed by the military\r\npower, but also to the Bishop of Quebec, who enjoined the Acadians to\r\ndemand of the English certain concessions, the chief of which were that\r\nthe priests should exercise their functions without being required to\r\nask leave of the Governor, and that the inhabitants should not be called\r\nupon for military service of any kind. The Bishop added that the\r\nprovisions of the treaty of Utrecht were insufficient, and that others\r\nought to be exacted.[264] The oral declaration of the English\r\nauthorities, that for the present the Acadians should not be required to\r\nbear arms, was not thought enough. They, or rather their prompters,\r\ndemanded a written pledge.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 264: _L'Evéque de Quebec à Le Loutre, Nov_. 1754, in _Public\r\nDocuments of Nova Scotia_, 240.]\r\n\r\nThe refusal to take the oath without reservation was not confined to the\r\nemigrants. Those who remained in the peninsula equally refused it,\r\nthough most of them were born and had always lived under the British\r\nflag. Far from pledging themselves to complete allegiance, they showed\r\ncontinual signs of hostility. In May three pretended French deserters\r\nwere detected among them inciting them to take arms against the\r\nEnglish.[265]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 265: _Ibid_., 242.]\r\n\r\nOn the capture of Beauséjour the British authorities found themselves in\r\na position of great difficulty. The New England troops were enlisted for\r\nthe year only, and could not be kept in Acadia. It was likely that the\r\nFrench would make a strong effort to recover the province, sure as they\r\nwere of support from the great body of its people. The presence of this\r\ndisaffected population was for the French commanders a continual\r\ninducement to invasion; and Lawrence was not strong enough to cope at\r\nonce with attack from without and insurrection from within.\r\n\r\nShirley had held for some time that there was no safety for Acadia but\r\nin ridding it of the Acadians. He had lately proposed that the lands of\r\nthe district of Chignecto, abandoned by their emigrant owners, should be\r\ngiven to English settlers, who would act as a check and a counterpoise\r\nto the neighboring French population. This advice had not been acted\r\nupon. Nevertheless Shirley and his brother Governor of Nova Scotia were\r\nkindred spirits, and inclined to similar measures. Colonel Charles\r\nLawrence had not the good-nature and conciliatory temper which marked\r\nhis predecessors, Cornwallis and Hopson. His energetic will was not apt\r\nto relent under the softer sentiments, and the behavior of the Acadians\r\nwas fast exhausting his patience. More than a year before, the Lords of\r\nTrade had instructed him that they had no right to their lands if they\r\npersisted in refusing the oath.[266] Lawrence replied, enlarging on\r\ntheir obstinacy, treachery, and \"ingratitude for the favor, indulgence,\r\nand protection they have at all times so undeservedly received from His\r\nMajesty's Government;\" declaring at the same time that, \"while they\r\nremain without taking the oaths, and have incendiary French priests\r\namong them, there are no hopes of their amendment;\" and that \"it would\r\nbe much better, if they refuse the oaths, that they were away.\"[267] \"We\r\nwere in hopes,\" again wrote the Lords of Trade, \"that the lenity which\r\nhad been shown to those people by indulging them in the free exercise of\r\ntheir religion and the quiet possession of their lands, would by degrees\r\nhave gained their friendship and assistance, and weaned their affections\r\nfrom the French; but we are sorry to find that this lenity has had so\r\nlittle effect, and that they still hold the same conduct, furnishing\r\nthem with labor, provisions, and intelligence, and concealing their\r\ndesigns from us.\" In fact, the Acadians, while calling themselves\r\nneutrals, were an enemy encamped in the heart of the province. These are\r\nthe reasons which explain and palliate a measure too harsh and\r\nindiscriminate to be wholly justified.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 266: _Lords of Trade to Lawrence, 4 March_, 1754.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 267: _Lawrence to Lords of Trade, 1 Aug_. 1754.]\r\n\r\nAbbé Raynal, who never saw the Acadians, has made an ideal picture of\r\nthem,[268] since copied and improved in prose and verse, till Acadia has\r\nbecome Arcadia. The plain realities of their condition and fate are\r\ntouching enough to need no exaggeration. They were a simple and very\r\nignorant peasantry, industrious and frugal till evil days came to\r\ndiscourage them; living aloof from the world, with little of that spirit\r\nof adventure which an easy access to the vast fur-bearing interior had\r\ndeveloped in their Canadian kindred; having few wants, and those of the\r\nrudest; fishing a little and hunting in the winter, but chiefly employed\r\nin cultivating the meadows along the River Annapolis, or rich marshes\r\nreclaimed by dikes from the tides of the Bay of Fundy. The British\r\nGovernment left them entirely free of taxation. They made clothing of\r\nflax and wool of their own raising, hats of similar materials, and shoes\r\nor moccasons of moose and seal skin. They bred cattle, sheep, hogs, and\r\nhorses in abundance; and the valley of the Annapolis, then as now, was\r\nknown for the profusion and excellence of its apples. For drink, they\r\nmade cider or brewed spruce-beer. French officials describe their\r\ndwellings as wretched wooden boxes, without ornaments or conveniences,\r\nand scarcely supplied with the most necessary furniture.[269] Two or\r\nmore families often occupied the same house; and their way of life,\r\nthough simple and virtuous, was by no means remarkable for cleanliness.\r\nSuch as it was, contentment reigned among them, undisturbed by what\r\nmodern America calls progress. Marriages were early, and population grew\r\napace. This humble society had its disturbing elements; for the\r\nAcadians, like the Canadians, were a litigious race, and neighbors often\r\nquarrelled about their boundaries. Nor were they without a bountiful\r\nshare of jealousy, gossip, and backbiting, to relieve the monotony of\r\ntheir lives; and every village had its turbulent spirits, sometimes by\r\nfits, though rarely long, contumacious even toward the curé, the guide,\r\ncounsellor, and ruler of his flock. Enfeebled by hereditary mental\r\nsubjection, and too long kept in leading-strings to walk alone, they\r\nneeded him, not for the next world only, but for this; and their\r\nsubmission, compounded of love and fear, was commonly without bounds. He\r\nwas their true government; to him they gave a frank and full allegiance,\r\nand dared not disobey him if they would. Of knowledge he gave them\r\nnothing; but he taught them to be true to their wives and constant at\r\nconfession and Mass, to stand fast for the Church and King Louis, and to\r\nresist heresy and King George; for, in one degree or another, the\r\nAcadian priest was always the agent of a double-headed foreign\r\npower,--the Bishop of Quebec allied with the Governor of Canada.[270]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 268: _Histoire philosophique et politique_, VI. 242 (ed.\r\n1772).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 269: _Beauharnois et Hocquart au Comte de Maurepas_, 12 Sept.\r\n1745._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 270: Franquet, _Journal_, 1751, says of the Acadians: \"Ils\r\naiment l'argent, n'ont dans toute leur conduite que leur intérêt pour\r\nobjet, sont, indifféremment des deux sexes, d'une inconsidération dans\r\nleurs discours qui dénote de la méchanceté.\" Another observer,\r\nDieréville, gives a more favorable picture.]\r\n\r\nWhen Monckton and the Massachusetts men laid siege to Beauséjour,\r\nGovernor Lawrence thought the moment favorable for exacting an\r\nunqualified oath of allegiance from the Acadians. The presence of a\r\nsuperior and victorious force would help, he thought, to bring them to\r\nreason; and there were some indications that this would be the result. A\r\nnumber of Acadian families, who at the promptings of Le Loutre had\r\nemigrated to Cape Breton, had lately returned to Halifax, promising to\r\nbe true subjects of King George if they could be allowed to repossess\r\ntheir lands. They cheerfully took the oath; on which they were\r\nreinstated in their old homes, and supplied with food for the\r\nwinter.[271] Their example unfortunately found few imitators.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 271: _Public Documents of Nova Scotia_, 228.]\r\n\r\nEarly in June the principal inhabitants of Grand Pré and other\r\nsettlements about the Basin of Mines brought a memorial, signed with\r\ntheir crosses, to Captain Murray, the military commandant in their\r\ndistrict, and desired him to send it to Governor Lawrence, to whom it\r\nwas addressed. Murray reported that when they brought it to him they\r\nbehaved with the greatest insolence, though just before they had been\r\nunusually submissive. He thought that this change of demeanor was caused\r\nby a report which had lately got among them of a French fleet in the Bay\r\nof Fundy; for it had been observed that any rumor of an approaching\r\nFrench force always had a similar effect. The deputies who brought the\r\nmemorial were sent with it to Halifax, where they laid it before the\r\nGovernor and Council. It declared that the signers had kept the\r\nqualified oath they had taken, \"in spite of the solicitations and\r\ndreadful threats of another power,\" and that they would continue to\r\nprove \"an unshaken fidelity to His Majesty, provided that His Majesty\r\nshall allow us the same liberty that he has _[hitherto]_ granted us.\"\r\nTheir memorial then demanded, in terms highly offensive to the Council,\r\nthat the guns, pistols, and other weapons, which they had lately been\r\nrequired to give up, should be returned to them. They were told in reply\r\nthat they had been protected for many years in the enjoyment of their\r\nlands, though they had not complied with the terms on which the lands\r\nwere granted; \"that they had always been treated by the Government with\r\nthe greatest lenity and tenderness, had enjoyed more privileges than\r\nother English subjects, and had been indulged in the free exercise of\r\ntheir religion;\" all which they acknowledged to be true. The Governor\r\nthen told them that their conduct had been undutiful and ungrateful;\r\n\"that they had discovered a constant disposition to assist His Majesty's\r\nenemies and to distress his subjects; that they had not only furnished\r\nthe enemy with provisions and ammunition, but had refused to supply the\r\n[_English_] inhabitants or Government, and when they did supply them,\r\nhad exacted three times the price for which they were sold at other\r\nmarkets.\" The hope was then expressed that they would no longer obstruct\r\nthe settlement of the province by aiding the Indians to molest and kill\r\nEnglish settlers; and they were rebuked for saying in their memorial\r\nthat they would be faithful to the King only on certain conditions. The\r\nGovernor added that they had some secret reason for demanding _their_\r\nweapons, and flattered themselves that French troops were at hand to\r\nsupport their insolence. In conclusion, they were told that now was a\r\ngood opportunity to prove their sincerity by taking the oath of\r\nallegiance, in the usual form, before the Council. They replied that\r\nthey had not made up their minds on that point, and could do nothing\r\ntill they had consulted their constituents. Being reminded that the oath\r\nwas personal to themselves, and that six years had already been given\r\nthem to think about it, they asked leave to retire and confer together.\r\nThis was granted, and at the end of an hour they came back with the same\r\nanswer as before; whereupon they were allowed till ten o'clock on the\r\nnext morning for a final decision.[272]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 272: _Minutes of Council at Halifax, 3 July, 1755_, in _Public\r\nDocuments of Nova Scotia_, 247-255.]\r\n\r\nAt the appointed time the Council again met, and the deputies were\r\nbrought in. They persisted stubbornly in the same refusal. \"They were\r\nthen informed,\" says the record, \"that the Council could no longer look\r\non them as subjects to His Britannic Majesty, but as subjects to the\r\nKing of France, and as such they must hereafter be treated; and they\r\nwere ordered to withdraw.\" A discussion followed in the Council. It was\r\ndetermined that the Acadians should be ordered to send new deputies to\r\nHalifax, who should answer for them, once for all, whether they would\r\naccept the oath or not; that such as refused it should not thereafter be\r\npermitted to take it; and \"that effectual measures ought to be taken to\r\nremove all such recusants out of the province.\"\r\n\r\nThe deputies, being then called in and told this decision, became\r\nalarmed, and offered to swear allegiance in the terms required. The\r\nanswer was that it was too late; that as they had refused the oath under\r\npersuasion, they could not be trusted when they took it under\r\ncompulsion. It remained to see whether the people at large would profit\r\nby their example.\r\n\r\n\"I am determined,\" wrote Lawrence to the Lords of Trade, \"to bring the\r\ninhabitants to a compliance, or rid the province of such perfidious\r\nsubjects.\"[273] First, in answer to the summons of the Council, the\r\ndeputies from Annapolis appeared, declaring that they had always been\r\nfaithful to the British Crown, but flatly refusing the oath. They were\r\ntold that, far from having been faithful subjects, they had always\r\nsecretly aided the Indians, and that many of them had been in arms\r\nagainst the English; that the French were threatening the province; and\r\nthat its affairs had reached a crisis when its inhabitants must either\r\npledge themselves without equivocation to be true to the British Crown,\r\nor else must leave the country. They all declared that they would lose\r\ntheir lands rather than take the oath. The Council urged them to\r\nconsider the matter seriously, warning them that, if they now persisted\r\nin refusal, no farther choice would be allowed them; and they were given\r\ntill ten o'clock on the following Monday to make their final answer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 273: _Lawrence to Lords of Trade, 18 July, 1755._]\r\n\r\nWhen that day came, another body of deputies had arrived from Grand Pré\r\nand the other settlements of the Basin of Mines; and being called before\r\nthe Council, both they and the former deputation absolutely refused to\r\ntake the oath of allegiance. These two bodies represented nine tenths of\r\nthe Acadian population within the peninsula. \"Nothing,\" pursues the\r\nrecord of the Council, \"now remained to be considered but what measures\r\nshould be taken to send the inhabitants away, and where they should be\r\nsent to.\" If they were sent to Canada, Cape Breton, or the neighboring\r\nislands, they would strengthen the enemy, and still threaten the\r\nprovince. It was therefore resolved to distribute them among the various\r\nEnglish colonies, and to hire vessels for the purpose with all\r\ndespatch.[274]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 274: _Minutes of Council, 4 July--28 July_, in _Public\r\nDocuments of Nova Scotia_, 255-267. Copies of these and other parts of\r\nthe record were sent at the time to England, and are now in the Public\r\nRecord Office, along with the letters of Lawrence.]\r\n\r\nThe oath, the refusal of which had brought such consequences, was a\r\nsimple pledge of fidelity and allegiance to King George II. and his\r\nsuccessors. Many of the Acadians had already taken an oath of fidelity,\r\nthough with the omission of the word \"allegiance,\" and, as they\r\ninsisted, with a saving clause exempting them from bearing arms. The\r\neffect of this was that they did not regard themselves as British\r\nsubjects, and claimed, falsely as regards most of them, the character\r\nof neutrals. It was to put an end to this anomalous state of things that\r\nthe oath without reserve had been demanded of them. Their rejection of\r\nit, reiterated in full view of the consequences, is to be ascribed\r\npartly to a fixed belief that the English would not execute their\r\nthreats, partly to ties of race and kin, but mainly to superstition.\r\nThey feared to take part with heretics against the King of France, whose\r\ncause, as already stated, they had been taught to regard as one with the\r\ncause of God; they were constrained by the dread of perdition. \"If the\r\nAcadians are miserable, remember that the priests are the cause of it,\"\r\nwrites the French officer Boishébert to the missionary Manach.[275]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 275: On the oath and his history, compare a long note by Mr.\r\nAkin in _Public Documents of Nova Scotia_, 263-267. Winslow in his\r\nJournal gives an abstract of a memorial sent him by the Acadians, in\r\nwhich they say that they had refused the oath, and so forfeited their\r\nlands, from motives of religion. I have shown in a former chapter that\r\nthe priests had been the chief instruments in preventing them from\r\naccepting the English government. Add the following:--\r\n\r\n\"Les malheurs des Accadiens sont beaucoup moins leur ouvrage que le\r\nfruit des sollicitations et des démarches des missionnaires.\" _Vaudreuil\r\nau Ministre, 6 Mai, 1760_.\r\n\r\n\"Si nous avons la guerre, et si les Accadiens sont misérables, souvenez\r\nvous que ce sont les prêtres qui en sont la cause.\" _Boishébert á\r\nManach, 21 Fév. 1760_. Both these writers had encouraged the priests in\r\ntheir intrigues so long as there were likely to profit the French\r\nGovernment, and only blamed them after they failed to accomplished what\r\nwas expected of them.\r\n\r\n\"Nous avons six missionnaires dont l'occupation perpetuelle est de\r\nporter les esprits au fanatisme et à la vengeance.... Je ne puis\r\nsupporter dans nos prêtres ces odieuses déclamations qu'ils font tous\r\nles jours aux sauvages: 'Les Anglois sont les ennemis de Dieu, les\r\ncompagnons du Diable.'\" Pichon, _Lettres et Mémoires pour servir à\r\nl'Histoire du Cap-Breton_, 160, 161. (La Haye, 1760.)]\r\n\r\nThe Council having come to a decision, Lawrence acquainted Monckton with\r\nthe result, and ordered him to seize all the adult males in the\r\nneighborhood of Beauséjour; and this, as we have seen, he promptly did.\r\nIt remains to observe how the rest of the sentence was carried into\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nInstructions were sent to Winslow to secure the inhabitants on or near\r\nthe Basin of Mines and place them on board transports, which, he was\r\ntold, would soon arrive from Boston. His orders were stringent: \"If you\r\nfind that fair means will not do with them, you must proceed by the most\r\nvigorous measures possible, not only in compelling them to embark, but\r\nin depriving those who shall escape of all means of shelter or support,\r\nby burning their houses and by destroying everything that may afford\r\nthem the means of subsistence in the country.\" Similar orders were given\r\nto Major Handfield, the regular officer in command at Annapolis.\r\n\r\nOn the fourteenth of August Winslow set out from his camp at Fort\r\nBeauséjour, or Cumberland, on his unenviable errand. He had with him but\r\ntwo hundred and ninety-seven men. His mood of mind was not serene. He\r\nwas chafed because the regulars had charged his men with stealing sheep;\r\nand he was doubly vexed by an untoward incident that happened on the\r\nmorning of his departure. He had sent forward his detachment under\r\nAdams, the senior captain, and they were marching by the fort with drums\r\nbeating and colors flying, when Monckton sent out his aide-de-camp with\r\na curt demand that the colors should be given up, on the ground that\r\nthey ought to remain with the regiment. Whatever the soundness of the\r\nreason, there was no courtesy in the manner of enforcing it. \"This\r\ntransaction raised my temper some,\" writes Winslow in his Diary; and he\r\nproceeds to record his opinion that \"it is the most ungenteel,\r\nill-natured thing that ever I saw.\" He sent Monckton a quaintly\r\nindignant note, in which he observed that the affair \"looks odd, and\r\nwill appear so in future history;\" but his commander, reckless of the\r\njudgments of posterity, gave him little satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThus ruffled in spirit, he embarked with his men and sailed down\r\nChignecto Channel to the Bay of Fundy. Here, while they waited the turn\r\nof the tide to enter the Basin of Mines, the shores of Cumberland lay\r\nbefore them dim in the hot and hazy air, and the promontory of Cape\r\nSplit, like some misshapen monster of primeval chaos, stretched its\r\nportentous length along the glimmering sea, with head of yawning rock,\r\nand ridgy back bristled with forests. Borne on the rushing flood, they\r\nsoon drifted through the inlet, glided under the rival promontory of\r\nCape Blomedon, passed the red sandstone cliffs of Lyon's Cove, and\r\ndescried the mouths of the rivers Canard and Des Habitants, where\r\nfertile marshes, diked against the tide, sustained a numerous and\r\nthriving population. Before them spread the boundless meadows of Grand\r\nPré, waving with harvests or alive with grazing cattle; the green slopes\r\nbehind were dotted with the simple dwellings of the Acadian farmers, and\r\nthe spire of the village church rose against a background of woody\r\nhills. It was a peaceful, rural scene, soon to become one of the most\r\nwretched spots on earth. Winslow did not land for the present, but held\r\nhis course to the estuary of the River Pisiquid, since called the Avon.\r\nHere, where the town of Windsor now stands, there was a stockade called\r\nFort Edward, where a garrison of regulars under Captain Alexander Murray\r\nkept watch over the surrounding settlements. The New England men pitched\r\ntheir tents on shore, while the sloops that had brought them slept on\r\nthe soft bed of tawny mud left by the fallen tide.\r\n\r\nWinslow found a warm reception, for Murray and his officers had been\r\nreduced too long to their own society not to welcome the coming of\r\nstrangers. The two commanders conferred together. Both had been ordered\r\nby Lawrence to \"clear the whole country of such bad subjects;\" and the\r\nmethods of doing so had been outlined for their guidance. Having come to\r\nsome understanding with his brother officer concerning the duties\r\nimposed on both, and begun an acquaintance which soon grew cordial on\r\nboth sides, Winslow embarked again and retraced his course to Grand Pré,\r\nthe station which the Governor had assigned him. \"Am pleased,\" he wrote\r\nto Lawrence, \"with the place proposed by your Excellency for our\r\nreception [_the village church_]. I have sent for the elders to remove\r\nall sacred things, to prevent their being defiled by heretics.\" The\r\nchurch was used as a storehouse and place of arms; the men pitched their\r\ntents between it and the graveyard; while Winslow took up his quarters\r\nin the house of the priest, where he could look from his window on a\r\ntranquil scene. Beyond the vast tract of grassland to which Grand Pré\r\nowed its name, spread the blue glistening breast of the Basin of Mines;\r\nbeyond this again, the distant mountains of Cobequid basked in the\r\nsummer sun; and nearer, on the left, Cape Blomedon reared its bluff head\r\nof rock and forest above the sleeping waves.\r\n\r\nAs the men of the settlement greatly outnumbered his own, Winslow set\r\nhis followers to surrounding the camp with a stockade. Card-playing was\r\nforbidden, because it encouraged idleness, and pitching quoits in camp,\r\nbecause it spoiled the grass. Presently there came a letter from\r\nLawrence expressing a fear that the fortifying of the camp might alarm\r\nthe inhabitants. To which Winslow replied that the making of the\r\nstockade had not alarmed them in the least, since they took it as a\r\nproof that the detachment was to spend the winter with them; and he\r\nadded, that as the harvest was not yet got in, he and Murray had agreed\r\nnot to publish the Governor's commands till the next Friday. He\r\nconcludes: \"Although it is a disagreeable part of duty we are put upon,\r\nI am sensible it is a necessary one, and shall endeavor strictly to obey\r\nyour Excellency's orders.\"\r\n\r\nOn the thirtieth, Murray, whose post was not many miles distant, made\r\nhim a visit. They agreed that Winslow should summon all the male\r\ninhabitants about Grand Pré to meet him at the church and hear the\r\nKing's orders, and that Murray should do the same for those around Fort\r\nEdward. Winslow then called in his three captains,--Adams, Hobbs, and\r\nOsgood,--made them swear secrecy, and laid before them his instructions\r\nand plans; which latter they approved. Murray then returned to his post,\r\nand on the next day sent Winslow a note containing the following: \"I\r\nthink the sooner we strike the stroke the better, therefore will be glad\r\nto see you here as soon as conveniently you can. I shall have the orders\r\nfor assembling ready written for your approbation, only the day blank,\r\nand am hopeful everything will succeed according to our wishes. The\r\ngentlemen join me in our best compliments to you and the Doctor.\"\r\n\r\nOn the next day, Sunday, Winslow and the Doctor, whose name was\r\nWhitworth, made the tour of the neighborhood, with an escort of fifty\r\nmen, and found a great quantity of wheat still on the fields. On Tuesday\r\nWinslow \"set out in a whale-boat with Dr. Whitworth and Adjutant\r\nKennedy, to consult with Captain Murray in this critical conjuncture.\"\r\nThey agreed that three in the afternoon of Friday should be the time of\r\nassembling; then between them they drew up a summons to the inhabitants,\r\nand got one Beauchamp, a merchant, to \"put it into French.\" It ran as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n     By John Winslow, Esquire, Lieutenant-Colonel and Commander of His\r\n     Majesty's troops at Grand Pré, Mines, River Canard, and places\r\n     adjacent.\r\n\r\n     To the inhabitants of the districts above named, as well ancients\r\n     as young men and lads.\r\n\r\n     Whereas His Excellency the Governor has instructed us of his last\r\n     resolution respecting the matters proposed lately to the\r\n     inhabitants, and has ordered us to communicate the same to the\r\n     inhabitants in general in person, His Excellency being desirous\r\n     that each of them should be fully satisfied of His Majesty's\r\n     intentions, which he has also ordered us to communicate to you,\r\n     such as they have been given him.\r\n\r\n     We therefore order and strictly enjoin by these presents to all the\r\n     inhabitants, as well of the above-named districts as of all the\r\n     other districts, both old men and young men, as well as all the\r\n     lads of ten years of age, to attend at the church in Grand Pré on\r\n     Friday, the fifth instant, at three of the clock in the afternoon,\r\n     that we may impart what we are ordered to communicate to them;\r\n     declaring that no excuse will be admitted on any pretence\r\n     whatsoever, on pain of forfeiting goods and chattels in default.\r\n\r\n     Given at Grand Pré, the second of September, in the twenty-ninth\r\n     year of His Majesty's reign, A.D. 1755.\r\n\r\nA similar summons was drawn up in the name of Murray for the inhabitants\r\nof the district of Fort Edward.\r\n\r\nCaptain Adams made a reconnoissance of the rivers Canard and Des\r\nHabitants, and reported \"a fine country and full of inhabitants, a\r\nbeautiful church, and abundance of the goods of the world.\" Another\r\nreconnoissance by Captains Hobbs and Osgood among the settlements behind\r\nGrand Pré brought reports equally favorable. On the fourth, another\r\nletter came from Murray: \"All the people quiet, and very busy at their\r\nharvest; if this day keeps fair, all will be in here in their barns. I\r\nhope to-morrow will crown all our wishes.\" The Acadians, like the bees,\r\nwere to gather a harvest for others to enjoy. The summons was sent out\r\nthat afternoon. Powder and ball were served to the men, and all were\r\nordered to keep within the lines.\r\n\r\nOn the next day the inhabitants appeared at the hour appointed, to the\r\nnumber of four hundred and eighteen men. Winslow ordered a table to be\r\nset in the middle of the church, and placed on it his instructions and\r\nthe address he had prepared. Here he took his stand in his laced\r\nuniform, with one or two subalterns from the regulars at Fort Edward,\r\nand such of the Massachusetts officers as were not on guard duty;\r\nstrong, sinewy figures, bearing, no doubt, more or less distinctly, the\r\npeculiar stamp with which toil, trade, and Puritanism had imprinted the\r\nfeatures of New England. Their commander was not of the prevailing type.\r\nHe was fifty-three years of age, with double chin, smooth forehead,\r\narched eyebrows, close powdered wig, and round, rubicund face, from\r\nwhich the weight of an odious duty had probably banished the smirk of\r\nself-satisfaction that dwelt there at other times.[276] Nevertheless, he\r\nhad manly and estimable qualities. The congregation of peasants, clad in\r\nrough homespun, turned their sunburned faces upon him, anxious and\r\nintent; and Winslow \"delivered them by interpreters the King's orders in\r\nthe following words,\" which, retouched in orthography and syntax, ran\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n     GENTLEMEN,--I have received from His Excellency, Governor Lawrence,\r\n     the King's instructions, which I have in my hand. By his orders you\r\n     are called together to hear His Majesty's final resolution\r\n     concerning the French inhabitants of this his province of Nova\r\n     Scotia, who for almost half a century have had more indulgence\r\n     granted them than any of his subjects in any part of his dominions.\r\n     What use you have made of it you yourselves best know.\r\n\r\n     The duty I am now upon, though necessary, is very disagreeable to\r\n     my natural make and temper, as I know it must be grievous to you,\r\n     who are of the same species. But it is not my business to\r\n     animadvert on the orders I have received, but to obey them; and\r\n     therefore without hesitation I shall deliver to you His Majesty's\r\n     instructions and commands, which are that your lands and tenements\r\n     and cattle and live-stock of all kinds are forfeited to the Crown,\r\n     with all your other effects, except money and household goods, and\r\n     that you yourselves are to be removed from this his province.\r\n\r\n     The peremptory orders of His Majesty are that all the French\r\n     inhabitants of these districts be removed; and through His\r\n     Majesty's goodness I am directed to allow you the liberty of\r\n     carrying with you your money and as many of your household goods as\r\n     you can take without overloading the vessels you go in. I shall do\r\n     everything in my power that all these goods be secured to you, and\r\n     that you be not molested in carrying them away, and also that whole\r\n     families shall go in the same vessel; so that this removal, which I\r\n     am sensible must give you a great deal of trouble, may be made as\r\n     easy as His Majesty's service will admit; and I hope that in\r\n     whatever part of the world your lot may fall, you may be faithful\r\n     subjects, and a peaceable and happy people.\r\n\r\n     I must also inform you that it is His Majesty's pleasure that you\r\n     remain in security under the inspection and direction of the troops\r\n     that I have the honor to command.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 276: See his portrait, at the rooms of the Massachusetts\r\nHistorical Society.]\r\n\r\nHe then declared them prisoners of the King. \"They were greatly struck,\"\r\nhe says, \"at this determination, though I believe they did not imagine\r\nthat they were actually to be removed.\" After delivering the address, he\r\nreturned to his quarters at the priest's house, whither he was followed\r\nby some of the elder prisoners, who begged leave to tell their families\r\nwhat had happened, \"since they were fearful that the surprise of their\r\ndetention would quite overcome them.\" Winslow consulted with his\r\nofficers, and it was arranged that the Acadians should choose twenty of\r\ntheir number each day to revisit their homes, the rest being held\r\nanswerable for their return.\r\n\r\nA letter, dated some days before, now came from Major Handfield at\r\nAnnapolis, saying that he had tried to secure the men of that\r\nneighborhood, but that many of them had escaped to the woods. Murray's\r\nreport from Fort Edward came soon after, and was more favorable: \"I have\r\nsucceeded finely, and have got a hundred and eighty-three men into my\r\npossession.\" To which Winslow replies: \"I have the favor of yours of\r\nthis day, and rejoice at your success, and also for the smiles that have\r\nattended the party here.\" But he adds mournfully: \"Things are now very\r\nheavy on my heart and hands.\" The prisoners were lodged in the church,\r\nand notice was sent to their families to bring them food. \"Thus,\" says\r\nthe Diary of the commander, \"ended the memorable fifth of September, a\r\nday of great fatigue and trouble.\"\r\n\r\nThere was one quarter where fortune did not always smile. Major Jedediah\r\nPreble, of Winslow's battalion, wrote to him that Major Frye had just\r\nreturned from Chipody, whither he had gone with a party of men to\r\ndestroy the settlements and bring off the women and children. After\r\nburning two hundred and fifty-three buildings he had reimbarked, leaving\r\nfifty men on shore at a place called Peticodiac to give a finishing\r\nstroke to the work by burning the \"Mass House,\" or church. While thus\r\nengaged, they were set upon by three hundred Indians and Acadians, led\r\nby the partisan officer Boishébert. More than half their number were\r\nkilled, wounded, or taken. The rest ensconced themselves behind the\r\nneighboring dikes, and Frye, hastily landing with the rest of his men,\r\nengaged the assailants for three hours, but was forced at last to\r\nreimbark.[277] Captain Speakman, who took part in the affair, also sent\r\nWinslow an account of it, and added: \"The people here are much concerned\r\nfor fear your party should meet with the same fate (being in the heart\r\nof a numerous devilish crew), which I pray God avert.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 277: Also _Boishébert à Drucourt, 10 Oct. 1755_, an\r\nexaggerated account. _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 18 Oct. 1755_, sets\r\nBoishébert's force at one hundred and twenty-five men.]\r\n\r\nWinslow had indeed some cause for anxiety. He had captured more Acadians\r\nsince the fifth; and had now in charge nearly five hundred able-bodied\r\nmen, with scarcely three hundred to guard them. As they were allowed\r\ndaily exercise in the open air, they might by a sudden rush get\r\npossession of arms and make serious trouble. On the Wednesday after the\r\nscene in the church some unusual movements were observed among them, and\r\nWinslow and his officers became convinced that they could not safely be\r\nkept in one body. Five vessels, lately arrived from Boston, were lying\r\nwithin the mouth of the neighboring river. It was resolved to place\r\nfifty of the prisoners on board each of these, and keep them anchored in\r\nthe Basin. The soldiers were all ordered under arms, and posted on an\r\nopen space beside the church and behind the priest's house. The\r\nprisoners were then drawn up before them, ranked six deep,--the young\r\nunmarried men, as the most dangerous, being told off and placed on the\r\nleft, to the number of a hundred and forty-one. Captain Adams, with\r\neighty men, was then ordered to guard them to the vessels. Though the\r\nobject of the movement had been explained to them, they were possessed\r\nwith the idea that they were to be torn from their families and sent\r\naway at once; and they all, in great excitement, refused to go. Winslow\r\ntold them that there must be no parley or delay; and as they still\r\nrefused, a squad of soldiers advanced towards them with fixed bayonets;\r\nwhile he himself, laying hold of the foremost young man, commanded him\r\nto move forward. \"He obeyed; and the rest followed, though slowly, and\r\nwent off praying, singing, and crying, being met by the women and\r\nchildren all the way (which is a mile and a half) with great\r\nlamentation, upon their knees, praying.\" When the escort returned, about\r\na hundred of the married men were ordered to follow the first party;\r\nand, \"the ice being broken,\" they readily complied. The vessels were\r\nanchored at a little distance from shore, and six soldiers were placed\r\non board each of them as a guard. The prisoners were offered the King's\r\nrations, but preferred to be supplied by their families, who, it was\r\narranged, should go in boats to visit them every day; \"and thus,\" says\r\nWinslow, \"ended this troublesome job.\" He was not given to effusions of\r\nfeeling, but he wrote to Major Handfield: \"This affair is more grievous\r\nto me than any service I was ever employed in.\"[278]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 278: Haliburton, who knew Winslow's Journal only by imperfect\r\nextracts, erroneously states that the men put on board the vessels were\r\nsent away immediately. They remained at Grand Pré several weeks, and\r\nwere then sent off at intervals with their families.]\r\n\r\nMurray sent him a note of congratulation: \"I am extremely pleased that\r\nthings are so clever at Grand Pré, and that the poor devils are so\r\nresigned. Here they are more patient than I could have expected for\r\npeople in their circumstances; and what surprises me still more is the\r\nindifference of the women, who really are, or seem, quite unconcerned. I\r\nlong much to see the poor wretches embarked and our affair a little\r\nsettled; and then I will do myself the pleasure of meeting you and\r\ndrinking their good voyage.\"\r\n\r\nThis agreeable consummation was still distant. There was a long and\r\npainful delay. The provisions for the vessels which were to carry the\r\nprisoners did not come; nor did the vessels themselves, excepting the\r\nfive already at Grand Pré. In vain Winslow wrote urgent letters to\r\nGeorge Saul, the commissary, to bring the supplies at once. Murray, at\r\nFort Edward, though with less feeling than his brother officer, was\r\nquite as impatient of the burden of suffering humanity on his hands. \"I\r\nam amazed what can keep the transports and Saul. Surely our friend at\r\nChignecto is willing to give us as much of our neighbors' company as he\r\nwell can.\"[279] Saul came at last with a shipload of provisions; but the\r\nlagging transports did not appear. Winslow grew heart-sick at the daily\r\nsight of miseries which he himself had occasioned, and wrote to a friend\r\nat Halifax: \"I know they deserve all and more than they feel; yet it\r\nhurts me to hear their weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth. I am\r\nin hopes our affairs will soon put on another face, and we get\r\ntransports, and I rid of the worst piece of service that ever I was in.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 279: _Murray to Winslow, 26 Sept. 1755_.]\r\n\r\nAfter weeks of delay, seven transports came from Annapolis; and Winslow\r\nsent three of them to Murray, who joyfully responded: \"Thank God, the\r\ntransports are come at last. So soon as I have shipped off my rascals,\r\nI will come down and settle matters with you, and enjoy ourselves a\r\nlittle.\"\r\n\r\nWinslow prepared for the embarkation. The Acadian prisoners and their\r\nfamilies were divided into groups answering to their several villages,\r\nin order that those of the same village might, as far as possible, go in\r\nthe same vessel. It was also provided that the members of each family\r\nshould remain together; and notice was given them to hold themselves in\r\nreadiness. \"But even now,\" he writes, \"I could not persuade the people I\r\nwas in earnest.\" Their doubts were soon ended. The first embarkation\r\ntook place on the eighth of October, under which date the Diary contains\r\nthis entry: \"Began to embark the inhabitants who went off very\r\nsolentarily [_sic_] and unwillingly, the women in great distress,\r\ncarrying off their children in their arms; others carrying their\r\ndecrepit parents in their carts, with all their goods; moving in great\r\nconfusion, and appeared a scene of woe and distress.\"[280]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 280: In spite of Winslow's care, some cases of separation of\r\nfamilies occurred; but they were not numerous.]\r\n\r\nThough a large number were embarked on this occasion, still more\r\nremained; and as the transports slowly arrived, the dismal scene was\r\nrepeated at intervals, with more order than at first, as the Acadians\r\nhad learned to accept their fate as a certainty. So far as Winslow was\r\nconcerned, their treatment seems to have been as humane as was possible\r\nunder the circumstances; but they complained of the men, who disliked\r\nand despised them. One soldier received thirty lashes for stealing fowls\r\nfrom them; and an order was issued forbidding soldiers or sailors, on\r\npain of summary punishment, to leave their quarters without permission,\r\n\"that an end may be put to distressing this distressed people.\" Two of\r\nthe prisoners, however, while trying to escape, were shot by a\r\nreconnoitring party.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of November Winslow reported that he had sent off\r\nfifteen hundred and ten persons, in nine vessels, and that more than six\r\nhundred still remained in his district.[281] The last of these were not\r\nembarked till late in December. Murray finished his part of the work at\r\nthe end of October, having sent from the district of Fort Edward eleven\r\nhundred persons in four frightfully crowded transports.[282] At the\r\nclose of that month sixteen hundred and sixty-four had been sent from\r\nthe district of Annapolis, where many others escaped to the woods.[283]\r\nA detachment which was ordered to seize the inhabitants of the district\r\nof Cobequid failed entirely, finding the settlements abandoned. In the\r\ncountry about Fort Cumberland, Monckton, who directed the operation in\r\nperson, had very indifferent success, catching in all but little more\r\nthan a thousand.[284] Le Guerne, missionary priest in this neighborhood,\r\ngives a characteristic and affecting incident of the embarkation. \"Many\r\nunhappy women, carried away by excessive attachment to their husbands,\r\nwhom they had been allowed to see too often, and closing their ears to\r\nthe voice of religion and their missionary, threw themselves blindly and\r\ndespairingly into the English vessels. And now was seen the saddest of\r\nspectacles; for some of these women, solely from a religious motive,\r\nrefused to take with them their grown-up sons and daughters.\"[285] They\r\nwould expose their own souls to perdition among heretics, but not those\r\nof their children.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 281: _Winslow to Monckton, 3 Nov. 1755_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 282: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 283: _Captain Adams to Winslow, 29 Nov. 1755_; see also Knox,\r\nI. 85, who exactly confirms Adams's figures.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 284: _Monckton to Winslow, 7 Oct. 1755_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 285: _Le Guerne à Prévost, 10 Mars, 1756_.]\r\n\r\nWhen all, or nearly all, had been sent off from the various points of\r\ndeparture, such of the houses and barns as remained standing were\r\nburned, in obedience to the orders of Lawrence, that those who had\r\nescaped might be forced to come in and surrender themselves. The whole\r\nnumber removed from the province, men, women, and children, was a little\r\nabove six thousand. Many remained behind; and while some of these\r\nwithdrew to Canada, Isle St. Jean, and other distant retreats, the rest\r\nlurked in the woods or returned to their old haunts, whence they waged,\r\nfor several years a guerilla warfare against the English. Yet their\r\nstrength was broken, and they were no longer a danger to the province.\r\n\r\nOf their exiled countrymen, one party overpowered the crew of the vessel\r\nthat carried them, ran her ashore at the mouth of the St. John, and\r\nescaped.[286] The rest were distributed among the colonies from\r\nMassachusetts to Georgia, the master of each transport having been\r\nprovided with a letter from Lawrence addressed to the Governor of the\r\nprovince to which he was bound, and desiring him to receive the\r\nunwelcome strangers. The provincials were vexed at the burden imposed\r\nupon them; and though the Acadians were not in general ill-treated,\r\ntheir lot was a hard one. Still more so was that of those among them who\r\nescaped to Canada. The chronicle of the Ursulines of Quebec, speaking of\r\nthese last, says that their misery was indescribable, and attributes it\r\nto the poverty of the colony. But there were other causes. The exiles\r\nfound less pity from kindred and fellow Catholics than from the heretics\r\nof the English colonies. Some of them who had made their way to Canada\r\nfrom Boston, whither they had been transported, sent word to a gentleman\r\nof that place who had befriended them, that they wished to return.[287]\r\nBougainville, the celebrated navigator, then aide-de-camp to Montcalm,\r\nsays concerning them: \"They are dying by wholesale. Their past and\r\npresent misery, joined to the rapacity of the Canadians, who seek only\r\nto squeeze out of them all the money they can, and then refuse them the\r\nhelp so dearly bought, are the cause of this mortality.\" \"A citizen of\r\nQuebec,\" he says farther on, \"was in debt to one of the partners of the\r\nGreat Company [_Government officials leagued for plunder_]. He had no\r\nmeans of paying. They gave him a great number of Acadians to board and\r\nlodge. He starved them with hunger and cold, got out of them what money\r\nthey had, and paid the extortioner. _Quel pays! Quels moeurs_!\"[288]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 286: _Lettre commune de Drucour et Prévost au Ministre, 6\r\nAvril, 1756. Vaudreuil au Ministre, 1 Juin, 1756_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 287: Hutchinson, _Hist. Mass._, III. 42, _note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 288: Bougainville, _Journal, 1756-1758_. His statements are\r\nsustained by _Mémoires sur le Canada, 1749-1760_.]\r\n\r\nMany of the exiles eventually reached Louisiana, where their descendants\r\nnow form a numerous and distinct population. Some, after incredible\r\nhardship, made their way back to Acadia, where, after the peace, they\r\nremained unmolested, and, with those who had escaped seizure, became the\r\nprogenitors of the present Acadians, now settled in various parts of the\r\nBritish maritime provinces, notably at Madawaska, on the upper St. John,\r\nand at Clare, in Nova Scotia. Others were sent from Virginia to England;\r\nand others again, after the complete conquest of the country, found\r\nrefuge in France.\r\n\r\nIn one particular the authors of the deportation were disappointed in\r\nits results. They had hoped to substitute a loyal population for a\r\ndisaffected one; but they failed for some time to find settlers for the\r\nvacated lands. The Massachusetts soldiers, to whom they were offered,\r\nwould not stay in the province; and it was not till five years later\r\nthat families of British stock began to occupy the waste fields of the\r\nAcadians. This goes far to show that a longing to become their heirs had\r\nnot, as has been alleged, any considerable part in the motives for their\r\nremoval.\r\n\r\nNew England humanitarianism, melting into sentimentality at a tale of\r\nwoe, has been unjust to its own. Whatever judgment may be passed on the\r\ncruel measure of wholesale expatriation, it was not put in execution\r\ntill every resource of patience and persuasion had been tried in vain.\r\nThe agents of the French Court, civil, military, and ecclesiastical, had\r\nmade some act of force a necessity. We have seen by what vile practices\r\nthey produced in Acadia a state of things intolerable, and impossible of\r\ncontinuance. They conjured up the tempest; and when it burst on the\r\nheads of the unhappy people, they gave no help. The Government of Louis\r\nXV. began with making the Acadians its tools, and ended with making them\r\nits victims.[289]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 289: It may not be remembered that the predecessor of Louis\r\nXV., without the slightest provocation or the pretence of any, gave\r\norders that the whole Protestant population of the colony of New York,\r\namounting to about eighteen thousand, should be seized, despoiled of\r\ntheir property, placed on board his ships and dispersed among the other\r\nBritish colonies in such a way that they could not reunite. Want of\r\npower alone prevented the execution of the order.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\n1755\r\n\r\nDieskau\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next stroke of the campaign was to be the capture of Crown Point,\r\nthat dangerous neighbor which, for a quarter of a century, had\r\nthreatened the northern colonies. Shirley, in January, had proposed an\r\nattack on it to the Ministry; and in February, without waiting their\r\nreply, he laid the plan before his Assembly. They accepted it, and\r\nvoted money for the pay and maintenance of twelve hundred men, provided\r\nthe adjacent colonies would contribute in due proportion.[290]\r\nMassachusetts showed a military activity worthy of the reputation she\r\nhad won. Forty-five hundred of her men, or one in eight of her adult\r\nmales, volunteered to fight the French, and enlisted for the various\r\nexpeditions, some in the pay of the province, and some in that of the\r\nKing.[291] It remained to name a commander for the Crown Point\r\nenterprise. Nobody had power to do so, for Braddock was not yet come;\r\nbut that time might not be lost, Shirley, at the request of his\r\nAssembly, took the responsibility on himself. If he had named a\r\nMassachusetts officer, it would have roused the jealousy of the other\r\nNew England colonies; and he therefore appointed William Johnson of New\r\nYork, thus gratifying that important province and pleasing the Five\r\nNations, who at this time looked on Johnson with even more than usual\r\nfavor. Hereupon, in reply to his request, Connecticut voted twelve\r\nhundred men, New Hampshire five hundred, and Rhode Island four hundred,\r\nall at their own charge; while New York, a little later, promised eight\r\nhundred more. When, in April, Braddock and the Council at Alexandria\r\napproved the plan and the commander, Shirley gave Johnson the commission\r\nof major-general of the levies of Massachusetts; and the governors of\r\nthe other provinces contributing to the expedition gave him similar\r\ncommissions for their respective contingents. Never did general take the\r\nfield with authority so heterogeneous.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 290: _Governor Shirley's Message to his Assembly, 13 Feb.\r\n1755. Resolutions of the Assembly of Massachusetts, 18 Feb. 1755_.\r\nShirley's original idea was to build a fort on a rising ground near\r\nCrown Point, in order to command it. This was soon abandoned for the\r\nmore honest and more practical plan of direct attack.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 291: _Correspondence of Shirley, Feb. 1755_. The number was\r\nmuch increased later in the season.]\r\n\r\nHe had never seen service, and knew nothing of war. By birth he was\r\nIrish, of good family, being nephew of Admiral Sir Peter Warren, who,\r\nowning extensive wild lands on the Mohawk, had placed the young man in\r\ncharge of them nearly twenty years before. Johnson was born to prosper.\r\nHe had ambition, energy, an active mind, a tall, strong person, a rough,\r\njovial temper, and a quick adaptation to his surroundings. He could\r\ndrink flip with Dutch boors, or Madeira with royal governors. He liked\r\nthe society of the great, would intrigue and flatter when he had an end\r\nto gain, and foil a rival without looking too closely at the means; but\r\ncompared with the Indian traders who infested the border, he was a model\r\nof uprightness. He lived by the Mohawk in a fortified house which was a\r\nstronghold against foes and a scene of hospitality to friends, both\r\nwhite and red. Here--for his tastes were not fastidious--presided for\r\nmany years a Dutch or German wench whom he finally married; and after\r\nher death a young Mohawk squaw took her place. Over his neighbors, the\r\nIndians of the Five Nations, and all others of their race with whom he\r\nhad to deal, he acquired a remarkable influence. He liked them, adopted\r\ntheir ways, and treated them kindly or sternly as the case required, but\r\nalways with a justice and honesty in strong contrast with the\r\nrascalities of the commission of Albany traders who had lately managed\r\ntheir affairs, and whom they so detested that one of their chiefs called\r\nthem \"not men, but devils.\" Hence, when Johnson was made Indian\r\nsuperintendent there was joy through all the Iroquois confederacy. When,\r\nin addition, he was made a general, he assembled the warriors in council\r\nto engage them to aid the expedition.\r\n\r\nThis meeting took place at his own house, known as Fort Johnson; and as\r\nmore than eleven hundred Indians appeared at his call, his larder was\r\nsorely taxed to entertain them. The speeches were interminable. Johnson,\r\nas master of Indian rhetoric, knew his audience too well not to contest\r\nwith them the palm of insufferable prolixity. The climax was reached on\r\nthe fourth day, and he threw down the war-belt. An Oneida chief took it\r\nup; Stevens, the interpreter, began the war-dance, and the assembled\r\nwarriors howled in chorus. Then a tub of punch was brought in, and they\r\nall drank the King's health.[292] They showed less alacrity, however, to\r\nfight his battles, and scarcely three hundred of them would take the\r\nwar-path. Too many of their friends and relatives were enlisted for the\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 292: _Report of Conference between Major-General Johnson and\r\nthe Indians, June, 1755_.]\r\n\r\nWhile the British colonists were preparing to attack Crown Point, the\r\nFrench of Canada were preparing to defend it. Duquesne, recalled from\r\nhis post, had resigned the government to the Marquis de Vaudreuil, who\r\nhad at his disposal the battalions of regulars that had sailed in the\r\nspring from Brest under Baron Dieskau. His first thought was to use them\r\nfor the capture of Oswego; but the letters of Braddock, found on the\r\nbattle-field, warned him of the design against Crown Point; while a\r\nreconnoitring party which had gone as far as the Hudson brought back\r\nnews that Johnson's forces were already in the field. Therefore the plan\r\nwas changed, and Dieskau was ordered to lead the main body of his\r\ntroops, not to Lake Ontario, but to Lake Champlain. He passed up the\r\nRichelieu, and embarked in boats and canoes for Crown Point. The veteran\r\nknew that the foes with whom he had to deal were but a mob of\r\ncountrymen. He doubted not of putting them to rout, and meant never to\r\nhold his hand till he had chased them back to Albany.[293] \"Make all\r\nhaste,\" Vaudreuil wrote to him; \"for when you return we shall send you\r\nto Oswego to execute our first design.\"[294]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 293: _Bigot au Ministre, 27 Août, 1755. Ibid., 5 Sept. 1755_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 294: _Mémoire pour servir d'Instruction à M. le Baron de\r\nDieskau, Maréchal des Camps et Armées du Roy, 15 Août, 1755_.]\r\n\r\nJohnson on his part was preparing to advance. In July about three\r\nthousand provincials were encamped near Albany, some on the \"Flats\"\r\nabove the town, and some on the meadows below. Hither, too, came a swarm\r\nof Johnson's Mohawks,--warriors, squaws, and children. They adorned the\r\nGeneral's face with war-paint, and he danced the war-dance; then with\r\nhis sword he cut the first slice from the ox that had been roasted\r\nwhole for their entertainment. \"I shall be glad,\" wrote the surgeon of a\r\nNew England regiment, \"if they fight as eagerly as they ate their ox and\r\ndrank their wine.\"\r\n\r\nAbove all things the expedition needed promptness; yet everything moved\r\nslowly. Five popular legislatures controlled the troops and the\r\nsupplies. Connecticut had refused to send her men till Shirley promised\r\nthat her commanding officer should rank next to Johnson. The whole\r\nmovement was for some time at a deadlock because the five governments\r\ncould not agree about their contributions of artillery and stores.[295]\r\nThe New Hampshire regiment had taken a short cut for Crown Point across\r\nthe wilderness of Vermont; but had been recalled in time to save them\r\nfrom probable destruction. They were now with the rest in the camp at\r\nAlbany, in such distress for provisions that a private subscription was\r\nproposed for their relief.[296]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 295: _The Conduct of Major-General Shirley briefly stated_\r\n(London, 1758).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 296: _Blanchard to Wentworth, 28 Aug. 1755_, in _Provincial\r\nPapers of New Hampshire_, VI. 429.]\r\n\r\nJohnson's army, crude as it was, had in it good material. Here was\r\nPhineas Lyman, of Connecticut, second in command, once a tutor at Yale\r\nCollege, and more recently a lawyer,--a raw soldier, but a vigorous and\r\nbrave one; Colonel Moses Titcomb, of Massachusetts, who had fought with\r\ncredit at Louisbourg; and Ephraim Williams, also colonel of a\r\nMassachusetts regiment, a tall and portly man, who had been a captain in\r\nthe last war, member of the General Court, and deputy-sheriff. He made\r\nhis will in the camp at Albany, and left a legacy to found the school\r\nwhich has since become Williams College. His relative, Stephen Williams,\r\nwas chaplain of his regiment, and his brother Thomas was its surgeon.\r\nSeth Pomeroy, gunsmith at Northampton, who, like Titcomb, had seen\r\nservice at Louisbourg, was its lieutenant-colonel. He had left a wife at\r\nhome, an excellent matron, to whom he was continually writing\r\naffectionate letters, mingling household cares with news of the camp,\r\nand charging her to see that their eldest boy, Seth, then in college at\r\nNew Haven, did not run off to the army. Pomeroy had with him his brother\r\nDaniel; and this he thought was enough. Here, too, was a man whose name\r\nis still a household word in New England,--the sturdy Israel Putnam,\r\nprivate in a Connecticut regiment; and another as bold as he, John\r\nStark, lieutenant in the New Hampshire levies, and the future victor of\r\nBennington.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were no soldiers, but farmers and farmers' sons who had\r\nvolunteered for the summer campaign. One of the corps had a blue uniform\r\nfaced with red. The rest wore their daily clothing. Blankets had been\r\nserved out to them by the several provinces, but the greater part\r\nbrought their own guns; some under the penalty of a fine if they came\r\nwithout them, and some under the inducement of a reward.[297] They had\r\nno bayonets, but carried hatchets in their belts as a sort of\r\nsubstitute.[298] At their sides were slung powder-horns, on which, in\r\nthe leisure of the camp, they carved quaint devices with the points of\r\ntheir jack-knives. They came chiefly from plain New England\r\nhomesteads,--rustic abodes, unpainted and dingy, with long well-sweeps,\r\ncapacious barns, rough fields of pumpkins and corn, and vast kitchen\r\nchimneys, above which in winter hung squashes to keep them from frost,\r\nand guns to keep them from rust.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 297: _Proclamation of Governor Shirley, 1755_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 298: _Second Letter to a Friend on the Battle of Lake\r\nGeorge_.]\r\n\r\nAs to the manners and morals of the army there is conflict of evidence.\r\nIn some respects nothing could be more exemplary. \"Not a chicken has\r\nbeen stolen,\" says William Smith, of New York; while, on the other hand,\r\nColonel Ephraim Williams writes to Colonel Israel Williams, then\r\ncommanding on the Massachusetts frontier: \"We are a wicked, profane\r\narmy, especially the New York and Rhode Island troops. Nothing to be\r\nheard among a great part of them but the language of Hell. If Crown\r\nPoint is taken, it will not be for our sakes, but for those good people\r\nleft behind.\"[299] There was edifying regularity in respect to form.\r\nSermons twice a week, daily prayers, and frequent psalm-singing\r\nalternated with the much-needed military drill.[300] \"Prayers among us\r\nnight and morning,\" writes Private Jonathan Caswell, of Massachusetts,\r\nto his father. \"Here we lie, knowing not when we shall march for Crown\r\nPoint; but I hope not long to tarry. Desiring your prayers to God for me\r\nas I am going to war, I am Your Ever Dutiful son.\"[301]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 299: _Papers of Colonel Israel Williams_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 300: _Massachusetts Archives_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 301: _Jonathan Caswell to John Caswell, 6 July, 1755_.]\r\n\r\nTo Pomeroy and some of his brothers in arms it seemed that they were\r\nengaged in a kind of crusade against the myrmidons of Rome. \"As you have\r\nat heart the Protestant cause,\" he wrote to his friend Israel Williams,\r\n\"so I ask an interest in your prayers that the Lord of Hosts would go\r\nforth with us and give us victory over our unreasonable, encroaching,\r\nbarbarous, murdering enemies.\"\r\n\r\nBoth Williams the surgeon and Williams the colonel chafed at the\r\nincessant delays. \"The expedition goes on very much as a snail runs,\"\r\nwrites the former to his wife; \"it seems we may possibly see Crown Point\r\nthis time twelve months.\" The Colonel was vexed because everything was\r\nout of joint in the department of transportation: wagoners mutinous for\r\nwant of pay; ordnance stores, camp-kettles, and provisions left behind.\r\n\"As to rum,\" he complains, \"it won't hold out nine weeks. Things appear\r\nmost melancholy to me.\" Even as he was writing, a report came of the\r\ndefeat of Braddock; and, shocked at the blow, his pen traced the words:\r\n\"The Lord have mercy on poor New England!\"\r\n\r\nJohnson had sent four Mohawk scouts to Canada. They returned on the\r\ntwenty-first of August with the report that the French were all astir\r\nwith preparation, and that eight thousand men were coming to defend\r\nCrown Point. On this a council of war was called; and it was resolved to\r\nsend to the several colonies for reinforcements.[302] Meanwhile the main\r\nbody had moved up the river to the spot called the Great Carrying Place,\r\nwhere Lyman had begun a fortified storehouse, which his men called Fort\r\nLyman, but which was afterwards named Fort Edward. Two Indian trails led\r\nfrom this point to the waters of Lake Champlain, one by way of Lake\r\nGeorge, and the other by way of Wood Creek. There was doubt which course\r\nthe army should take. A road was begun to Wood Creek; then it was\r\ncountermanded, and a party was sent to explore the path to Lake George.\r\n\"With submission to the general officers,\" Surgeon Williams again\r\nwrites, \"I think it a very grand mistake that the business of\r\nreconnoitring was not done months agone.\" It was resolved at last to\r\nmarch for Lake George; gangs of axemen were sent to hew out the way; and\r\non the twenty-sixth two thousand men were ordered to the lake, while\r\nColonel Blanchard, of New Hampshire, remained with five hundred to\r\nfinish and defend Fort Lyman.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 302: _Minutes of Council of War, 22 Aug. 1755. Ephraim\r\nWilliams to Benjamin Dwight, 22 Aug. 1755_.]\r\n\r\nThe train of Dutch wagons, guarded by the homely soldiery, jolted slowly\r\nover the stumps and roots of the newly made road, and the regiments\r\nfollowed at their leisure. The hardships of the way were not without\r\ntheir consolations. The jovial Irishman who held the chief command made\r\nhimself very agreeable to the New England officers. \"We went on about\r\nfour or five miles,\" says Pomeroy in his Journal, \"then stopped, ate\r\npieces of broken bread and cheese, and drank some fresh lemon-punch and\r\nthe best of wine with General Johnson and some of the field-officers.\"\r\nIt was the same on the next day. \"Stopped about noon and dined with\r\nGeneral Johnson by a small brook under a tree; ate a good dinner of cold\r\nboiled and roast venison; drank good fresh lemon-punch and wine.\"\r\n\r\nThat afternoon they reached their destination, fourteen miles from Fort\r\nLyman. The most beautiful lake in America lay before them; then more\r\nbeautiful than now, in the wild charm of untrodden mountains and virgin\r\nforests. \"I have given it the name of Lake George,\" wrote Johnson to the\r\nLords of Trade, \"not only in honor of His Majesty, but to ascertain his\r\nundoubted dominion here.\" His men made their camp on a piece of rough\r\nground by the edge of the water, pitching their tents among the stumps\r\nof the newly felled trees. In their front was a forest of pitch-pine; on\r\ntheir right, a marsh, choked with alders and swamp-maples; on their\r\nleft, the low hill where Fort George was afterwards built; and at their\r\nrear, the lake. Little was done to clear the forest in front, though it\r\nwould give excellent cover to an enemy. Nor did Johnson take much pains\r\nto learn the movements of the French in the direction of Crown Point,\r\nthough he sent scouts towards South Bay and Wood Creek. Every day stores\r\nand bateaux, or flat boats, came on wagons from Fort Lyman; and\r\npreparation moved on with the leisure that had marked it from the first.\r\nAbout three hundred Mohawks came to the camp, and were regarded by the\r\nNew England men as nuisances. On Sunday the gray-haired Stephen Williams\r\npreached to these savage allies a long Calvinistic sermon, which must\r\nhave sorely perplexed the interpreter whose business it was to turn it\r\ninto Mohawk; and in the afternoon young Chaplain Newell, of Rhode\r\nIsland, expounded to the New England men the somewhat untimely text,\r\n\"Love your enemies.\" On the next Sunday, September seventh, Williams\r\npreached again, this time to the whites from a text in Isaiah. It was a\r\npeaceful day, fair and warm, with a few light showers; yet not wholly a\r\nday of rest, for two hundred wagons came up from Fort Lyman, loaded with\r\nbateaux. After the sermon there was an alarm. An Indian scout came in\r\nabout sunset, and reported that he had found the trail of a body of men\r\nmoving from South Bay towards Fort Lyman. Johnson called for a volunteer\r\nto carry a letter of warning to Colonel Blanchard, the commander. A\r\nwagoner named Adams offered himself for the perilous service, mounted,\r\nand galloped along the road with the letter. Sentries were posted, and\r\nthe camp fell asleep.\r\n\r\nWhile Johnson lay at Lake George, Dieskau prepared a surprise for him.\r\nThe German Baron had reached Crown Point at the head of three thousand\r\nfive hundred and seventy-three men, regulars, Canadians, and\r\nIndians.[303] He had no thought of waiting there to be attacked. The\r\ntroops were told to hold themselves ready to move at a moment's notice.\r\nOfficers--so ran the order--will take nothing with them but one spare\r\nshirt, one spare pair of shoes, a blanket, a bearskin, and provisions\r\nfor twelve days; Indians are not to amuse themselves by taking scalps\r\ntill the enemy is entirely defeated, since they can kill ten men in the\r\ntime required to scalp one.[304] Then Dieskau moved on, with nearly all\r\nhis force, to Carillon, or Ticonderoga, a promontory commanding both the\r\nroutes by which alone Johnson could advance, that of Wood Creek and that\r\nof Lake George.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 303: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 25 Sept. 1755_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 304: _Livre d'Ordres, Août, Sept. 1755_.]\r\n\r\nThe Indians allies were commanded by Legardeur de Saint-Pierre, the\r\nofficer who had received Washington on his embassy to Fort Le Boeuf.\r\nThese unmanageable warriors were a constant annoyance to Dieskau, being\r\na species of humanity quite new to him. \"They drive us crazy,\" he says,\r\n\"from morning till night. There is no end to their demands. They have\r\nalready eaten five oxen and as many hogs, without counting the kegs of\r\nbrandy they have drunk. In short, one needs the patience of an angel to\r\nget on with these devils; and yet one must always force himself to seem\r\npleased with them.\"[305]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 305: _Dieskau à Vaudreuil, 1 Sept. 1755_.]\r\n\r\nThey would scarcely even go out as scouts. At last, however, on the\r\nfourth of September, a reconnoitring party came in with a scalp and an\r\nEnglish prisoner caught near Fort Lyman. He was questioned under the\r\nthreat of being given to the Indians for torture if he did not tell the\r\ntruth; but, nothing daunted, he invented a patriotic falsehood; and\r\nthinking to lure his captors into a trap, told them that the English\r\narmy had fallen back to Albany, leaving five hundred men at Fort Lyman,\r\nwhich he represented as indefensible. Dieskau resolved on a rapid\r\nmovement to seize the place. At noon of the same day, leaving a part of\r\nhis force at Ticonderoga, he embarked the rest in canoes and advanced\r\nalong the narrow prolongation of Lake Champlain that stretched southward\r\nthrough the wilderness to where the town of Whitehall now stands. He\r\nsoon came to a point where the lake dwindled to a mere canal, while two\r\nmighty rocks, capped with stunted forests, faced each other from the\r\nopposing banks. Here he left an officer named Roquemaure with a\r\ndetachment of troops, and again advanced along a belt of quiet water\r\ntraced through the midst of a deep marsh, green at that season with\r\nsedge and water-weeds, and known to the English as the Drowned Lands.\r\nBeyond, on either hand, crags feathered with birch and fir, or hills\r\nmantled with woods, looked down on the long procession of canoes.[306]\r\nAs they neared the site of Whitehall, a passage opened on the right, the\r\nentrance to a sheet of lonely water slumbering in the shadow of woody\r\nmountains, and forming the lake then, as now, called South Bay. They\r\nadvanced to its head, landed where a small stream enters it, left the\r\ncanoes under a guard, and began their march through the forest. They\r\ncounted in all two hundred and sixteen regulars of the battalions of\r\nLanguedoc and La Reine, six hundred and eighty-four Canadians, and above\r\nsix hundred Indians.[307] Every officer and man carried provisions for\r\neight days in his knapsack. They encamped at night by a brook, and in\r\nthe morning, after hearing Mass, marched again. The evening of the next\r\nday brought them near the road that led to Lake George. Fort Lyman was\r\nbut three miles distant. A man on horseback galloped by; it was Adams,\r\nJohnson's unfortunate messenger. The Indians shot him, and found the\r\nletter in his pocket. Soon after, ten or twelve wagons appeared in\r\ncharge of mutinous drivers, who had left the English camp without\r\norders. Several of them were shot, two were taken, and the rest ran off.\r\nThe two captives declared that, contrary to the assertion of the\r\nprisoner at Ticonderoga, a large force lay encamped at the lake. The\r\nIndians now held a council, and presently gave out that they would not\r\nattack the fort, which they thought well supplied with cannon, but that\r\nthey were willing to attack the camp at Lake George. Remonstrance was\r\nlost upon them. Dieskau was not young, but he was daring to rashness,\r\nand inflamed to emulation by the victory over Braddock. The enemy were\r\nreported greatly to outnumber him; but his Canadian advisers had assured\r\nhim that the English colony militia were the worst troops on the face of\r\nthe earth. \"The more there are,\" he said to the Canadians and Indians,\r\n\"the more we shall kill;\" and in the morning the order was given to\r\nmarch for the lake.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 306: I passed this way three weeks ago. There are some points\r\nwhere the scene is not much changed since Dieskau saw it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 307: _Mémoire sur l'Affaire du 8 Septembre_.]\r\n\r\nThey moved rapidly on through the waste of pines, and soon entered the\r\nrugged valley that led to Johnson's camp. On their right was a gorge\r\nwhere, shadowed in bushes, gurgled a gloomy brook; and beyond rose the\r\ncliffs that buttressed the rocky heights of French Mountain, seen by\r\nglimpses between the boughs. On their left rose gradually the lower\r\nslopes of West Mountain. All was rock, thicket, and forest; there was no\r\nopen space but the road along which the regulars marched, while the\r\nCanadians and Indians pushed their way through the woods in such order\r\nas the broken ground would permit.\r\n\r\nThey were three miles from the lake, when their scouts brought in a\r\nprisoner who told them that a column of English troops was approaching.\r\nDieskau's preparations were quickly made. While the regulars halted on\r\nthe road, the Canadians and Indians moved to the front, where most of\r\nthem hid in the forest along the slopes of West Mountain, and the rest\r\nlay close among the thickets on the other side. Thus, when the English\r\nadvanced to attack the regulars in front, they would find themselves\r\ncaught in a double ambush. No sight or sound betrayed the snare; but\r\nbehind every bush crouched a Canadian or a savage, with gun cocked and\r\nears intent, listening for the tramp of the approaching column.\r\n\r\nThe wagoners who escaped the evening before had reached the camp about\r\nmidnight, and reported that there was a war-party on the road near Fort\r\nLyman. Johnson had at this time twenty-two hundred effective men,\r\nbesides his three hundred Indians.[308] He called a council of war in\r\nthe morning, and a resolution was taken which can only be explained by a\r\ncomplete misconception as to the force of the French. It was determined\r\nto send out two detachments of five hundred men each, one towards Fort\r\nLyman, and the other towards South Bay, the object being, according to\r\nJohnson \"to catch the enemy in their retreat.\"[309] Hendrick, chief of\r\nthe Mohawks, a brave and sagacious warrior, expressed his dissent after\r\na fashion of his own. He picked up a stick and broke it; then he picked\r\nup several sticks, and showed that together they could not be broken.\r\nThe hint was taken, and the two detachments were joined in one. Still\r\nthe old savage shook his head. \"If they are to be killed,\" he said,\r\n\"they are too many; if they are to fight, they are too few.\"\r\nNevertheless, he resolved to share their fortunes; and mounting on a\r\ngun-carriage, he harangued his warriors with a voice so animated and\r\ngestures so expressive, that the New England officers listened in\r\nadmiration, though they understood not a word. One difficulty remained.\r\nHe was too old and fat to go afoot; but Johnson lent him a horse, which\r\nhe bestrode, and trotted to the head of the column, followed by two\r\nhundred of his warriors as fast as they could grease, paint, and\r\nbefeather themselves.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 308: _Wraxall to Lieutenant-Governor Delancey, 10 Sept. 1755_.\r\nWraxall was Johnson's aide-de-camp and secretary. The _Second Letter to\r\na Friend_ says twenty-one hundred whites and two hundred or three\r\nhundred Indians. Blodget, who was also on the spot, sets the whites at\r\ntwo thousand.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 309: _Letter to the Governors of the several Colonies, 9 Sept.\r\n1755_.]\r\n\r\nCaptain Elisha Hawley was in his tent, finishing a letter which he had\r\njust written to his brother Joseph; and these were the last words: \"I am\r\nthis minute agoing out in company with five hundred men to see if we can\r\nintercept 'em in their retreat, or find their canoes in the Drowned\r\nLands; and therefore must conclude this letter.\" He closed and directed\r\nit; and in an hour received his death-wound.\r\n\r\nIt was soon after eight o'clock when Ephraim Williams left the camp with\r\nhis regiment, marched a little distance, and then waited for the rest of\r\nthe detachment under Lieutenant-Colonel Whiting. Thus Dieskau had full\r\ntime to lay his ambush. When Whiting came up, the whole moved on\r\ntogether, so little conscious of danger that no scouts were thrown out\r\nin front or flank; and, in full security, they entered the fatal snare.\r\nBefore they were completely involved in it, the sharp eye of old\r\nHendrick detected some sign of an enemy. At that instant, whether by\r\naccident or design, a gun was fired from the bushes. It is said that\r\nDieskau's Iroquois, seeing Mohawks, their relatives, in the van, wished\r\nto warn them of danger. If so, the warning came too late. The thickets\r\non the left blazed out a deadly fire, and the men fell by scores. In the\r\nwords of Dieskau, the head of the column \"was doubled up like a pack of\r\ncards.\" Hendrick's horse was shot down, and the chief was killed with a\r\nbayonet as he tried to rise. Williams, seeing a rising ground on his\r\nright, made for it, calling on his men to follow; but as he climbed the\r\nslope, guns flashed from the bushes, and a shot through the brain laid\r\nhim dead. The men in the rear pressed forward to support their comrades,\r\nwhen a hot fire was suddenly opened on them from the forest along their\r\nright flank. Then there was a panic; some fled outright, and the whole\r\ncolumn recoiled. The van now became the rear, and all the force of the\r\nenemy rushed upon it, shouting and screeching. There was a moment of\r\ntotal confusion; but a part of Williams's regiment rallied under command\r\nof Whiting, and covered the retreat, fighting behind trees like Indians,\r\nand firing and falling back by turns, bravely aided by some of the\r\nMohawks and by a detachment which Johnson sent to their aid. \"And a very\r\nhandsome retreat they made,\" writes Pomeroy; \"and so continued till they\r\ncame within about three quarters of a mile of our camp. This was the\r\nlast fire our men gave our enemies, which killed great numbers of them;\r\nthey were seen to drop as pigeons.\" So ended the fray long known in New\r\nEngland fireside story as the \"bloody morning scout.\" Dieskau now\r\nordered a halt, and sounded his trumpets to collect his scattered men.\r\nHis Indians, however, were sullen and unmanageable, and the Canadians\r\nalso showed signs of wavering. The veteran who commanded them all,\r\nLegardeur de Saint-Pierre, had been killed. At length they were\r\npersuaded to move again, the regulars leading the way.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour after Williams and his men had begun their march, a\r\ndistant rattle of musketry was heard at the camp; and as it grew nearer\r\nand louder, the listeners knew that their comrades were on the retreat.\r\nThen, at the eleventh hour, preparations were begun for defence. A sort\r\nof barricade was made along the front of the camp, partly of wagons, and\r\npartly of inverted bateaux, but chiefly of the trunks of trees hastily\r\nhewn down in the neighboring forest and laid end to end in a single row.\r\nThe line extended from the southern slopes of the hill on the left\r\nacross a tract of rough ground to the marshes on the right. The forest,\r\nchoked with bushes and clumps of rank ferns, was within a few yards of\r\nthe barricade, and there was scarcely time to hack away the intervening\r\nthickets. Three cannon were planted to sweep the road that descended\r\nthrough the pines, and another was dragged up to the ridge of the hill.\r\nThe defeated party began to come in; first, scared fugitives both white\r\nand red, then, gangs of men bringing the wounded; and at last, an hour\r\nand a half after the first fire was heard, the main detachment was seen\r\nmarching in compact bodies down the road.\r\n\r\nFive hundred men were detailed to guard the flanks of the camp. The rest\r\nstood behind the wagons or lay flat behind the logs and inverted\r\nbateaux, the Massachusetts men on the right, and the Connecticut men on\r\nthe left. Besides Indians, this actual fighting force was between\r\nsixteen and seventeen hundred rustics, very few of whom had been under\r\nfire before that morning. They were hardly at their posts when they saw\r\nranks of white-coated soldiers moving down the road, and bayonets that\r\nto them seemed innumerable glittering between the boughs. At the same\r\ntime a terrific burst of war-whoops rose along the front; and, in the\r\nwords of Pomeroy, \"the Canadians and Indians, helter-skelter, the woods\r\nfull of them, came running with undaunted courage right down the hill\r\nupon us, expecting to make us flee.\"[310] Some of the men grew uneasy;\r\nwhile the chief officers, sword in hand, threatened instant death to any\r\nwho should stir from their posts.[311] If Dieskau had made an assault at\r\nthat instant, there could be little doubt of the result.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 310: _Seth Pomeroy to his Wife, 10 Sept. 1755_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 311: _Dr. Perez Marsh to William Williams, 25 Sept. 1755_.]\r\n\r\nThis he well knew; but he was powerless. He had his small force of\r\nregulars well in hand; but the rest, red and white, were beyond control,\r\nscattering through the woods and swamps, shouting, yelling, and firing\r\nfrom behind trees. The regulars advanced with intrepidity towards the\r\ncamp where the trees were thin, deployed, and fired by platoons, till\r\nCaptain Eyre, who commanded the artillery, opened on them with grape,\r\nbroke their ranks, and compelled them to take to cover. The fusillade\r\nwas now general on both sides, and soon grew furious. \"Perhaps,\" Seth\r\nPomeroy wrote to his wife, two days after, \"the hailstones from heaven\r\nwere never much thicker than their bullets came; but, blessed be God!\r\nthat did not in the least daunt or disturb us.\" Johnson received a\r\nflesh-wound in the thigh, and spent the rest of the day in his tent.\r\nLyman took command; and it is a marvel that he escaped alive, for he was\r\nfour hours in the heat of the fire, directing and animating the men. \"It\r\nwas the most awful day my eyes ever beheld,\" wrote Surgeon Williams to\r\nhis wife; \"there seemed to be nothing but thunder and lightning and\r\nperpetual pillars of smoke.\" To him, his colleague Doctor Pynchon, one\r\nassistant, and a young student called \"Billy,\" fell the charge of the\r\nwounded of his regiment. \"The bullets flew about our ears all the time\r\nof dressing them; so we thought best to leave our tent and retire a few\r\nrods behind the shelter of a log-house.\" On the adjacent hill stood one\r\nBlodget, who seems to have been a sutler, watching, as well as bushes,\r\ntrees, and smoke would let him, the progress of the fight, of which he\r\nsoon after made and published a curious bird's-eye view. As the wounded\r\nmen were carried to the rear, the wagoners about the camp took their\r\nguns and powder-horns, and joined in the fray. A Mohawk, seeing one of\r\nthese men still unarmed, leaped over the barricade, tomahawked the\r\nnearest Canadian, snatched his gun, and darted back unhurt. The brave\r\nsavage found no imitators among his tribesmen, most of whom did nothing\r\nbut utter a few war-whoops, saying that they had come to see their\r\nEnglish brothers fight. Some of the French Indians opened a distant\r\nflank fire from the high ground beyond the swamp on the right, but were\r\ndriven off by a few shells dropped among them.\r\n\r\nDieskau had directed his first attack against the left and center of\r\nJohnson's position. Making no impression here, he tried to force the\r\nright, where lay the regiments of Titcomb, Ruggles, and Williams. The\r\nfire was hot for about an hour. Titcomb was shot dead, a rod in front of\r\nthe barricade, firing from behind a tree like a common soldier. At\r\nlength Dieskau, exposing himself within short range of the English line,\r\nwas hit in the leg. His adjutant, Montreuil, himself wounded, came to\r\nhis aid, and was washing the injured limb with brandy, when the\r\nunfortunate commander was again hit in the knee and thigh. He seated\r\nhimself behind a tree, while the Adjutant called two Canadians to carry\r\nhim to the rear. One of them was instantly shot down. Montreuil took his\r\nplace; but Dieskau refused to be moved, bitterly denounced the Canadians\r\nand Indians, and ordered the Adjutant to leave him and lead the regulars\r\nin a last effort against the camp.\r\n\r\nIt was too late. Johnson's men, singly or in small squads, already\r\ncrossing their row of logs; and in a few moments the whole dashed\r\nforward with a shout, falling upon the enemy with hatchets and the butts\r\nof their guns. The French and their allies fled. The wounded General\r\nstill sat helpless by the tree, when he saw a soldier aiming at him. He\r\nsigned to the man not to fire; but he pulled trigger, shot him across\r\nthe hips, leaped upon him, and ordered him in French to surrender. \"I\r\nsaid,\" writes Dieskau, \"'You rascal, why did you fire? You see a man\r\nlying in his blood on the ground, and you shoot him!' He answered: 'How\r\ndid I know that you had not got a pistol? I had rather kill the devil\r\nthan have the devil kill me.' 'You are a Frenchman?' I asked. 'Yes,' he\r\nreplied; 'it is more than ten years since I left Canada;' whereupon\r\nseveral others fell on me and stripped me. I told them to carry me to\r\ntheir general, which they did. On learning who I was, he sent for\r\nsurgeons, and, though wounded himself, refused all assistance till my\r\nwounds were dressed.\"[312]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 312: _Dialogue entre le Maréchal de Saxe et le Baron de\r\nDieskau aux Champs Élysées_. This paper is in the Archives de la Guerre,\r\nand was evidently written or inspired by Dieskau himself. In spite of\r\nits fanciful form, it is a sober statement of the events of the\r\ncampaign. There is a translation of it in _N.Y. Col. Docs._, X. 340.]\r\n\r\nIt was near five o'clock when the final rout took place. Some time\r\nbefore, several hundred of the Canadians and Indians had left the field\r\nand returned to the scene of the morning fight, to plunder and scalp the\r\ndead. They were resting themselves near a pool in the forest, close\r\nbeside the road, when their repose was interrupted by a volley of\r\nbullets. It was fired by a scouting party from Fort Lyman, chiefly\r\nbackwoodsmen, under Captains Folsom and McGinnis. The assailants were\r\ngreatly outnumbered; but after a hard fight the Canadians and Indians\r\nbroke and fled. McGinnis was mortally wounded. He continued to give\r\norders till the firing was over; then fainted, and was carried, dying,\r\nto the camp. The bodies of the slain, according to tradition, were\r\nthrown into the pool, which bears to this day the name of Bloody Pond.\r\n\r\nThe various bands of fugitives rejoined each other towards night, and\r\nencamped in the forest; then made their way round the southern shoulder\r\nof French Mountain, till, in the next evening, they reached their\r\ncanoes. Their plight was deplorable; for they had left their knapsacks\r\nbehind, and were spent with fatigue and famine.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile their captive general was not yet out of danger. The Mohawks\r\nwere furious at their losses in the ambush of the morning, and above all\r\nat the death of Hendrick. Scarcely were Dieskau's wounds dressed, when\r\nseveral of them came into the tent. There was a long and angry dispute\r\nin their own language between them and Johnson, after which they went\r\nout very sullenly. Dieskau asked what they wanted. \"What do they want?\"\r\nreturned Johnson. \"To burn you, by God, eat you, and smoke you in their\r\npipes, in revenge for three or four of their chiefs that were killed.\r\nBut never fear; you shall be safe with me, or else they shall kill us\r\nboth.\"[313] The Mohawks soon came back, and another talk ensued, excited\r\nat first, and then more calm; till at length the visitors, seemingly\r\nappeased, smiled, gave Dieskau their hands in sign of friendship, and\r\nquietly went out again. Johnson warned him that he was not yet safe; and\r\nwhen the prisoner, fearing that his presence might incommode his host,\r\nasked to be removed to another tent, a captain and fifty men were\r\nordered to guard him. In the morning an Indian, alone and apparently\r\nunarmed, loitered about the entrance, and the stupid sentinel let him\r\npass in. He immediately drew a sword from under a sort of cloak which he\r\nwore, and tried to stab Dieskau; but was prevented by the Colonel to\r\nwhom the tent belonged, who seized upon him, took away his sword, and\r\npushed him out. As soon as his wounds would permit, Dieskau was carried\r\non a litter, strongly escorted, to Fort Lyman, whence he was sent to\r\nAlbany, and afterwards to New York. He is profuse in expressions of\r\ngratitude for the kindness shown him by the colonial officers, and\r\nespecially by Johnson. Of the provincial soldiers he remarked soon after\r\nthe battle that in the morning they fought like good boys, about noon\r\nlike men, and in the afternoon like devils.[314] In the spring of 1757\r\nhe sailed for England, and was for a time at Falmouth; whence Colonel\r\nMatthew Sewell, fearing that he might see and learn too much, wrote to\r\nthe Earl of Holdernesse: \"The Baron has great penetration and quickness\r\nof apprehension. His long service under Marshal Saxe renders him a man\r\nof real consequence, to be cautiously observed. His circumstances\r\ndeserve compassion, for indeed they are very melancholy, and I much\r\ndoubt of his being ever perfectly cured.\" He was afterwards a long time\r\nat Bath, for the benefit of the waters. In 1760 the famous Diderot met\r\nhim at Paris, cheerful and full of anecdote, though wretchedly shattered\r\nby his wounds. He died a few years later.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 313: See the story as told by Dieskau to the celebrated\r\nDiderot, at Paris, in 1760. _Mémoires de Diderot_, I. 402 (1830).\r\nCompare _N.Y. Col. Docs._, X. 343.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 314: _Dr. Perez Marsh to William Williams, 25 Sept. 1755_.]\r\n\r\nOn the night after the battle the yeomen warriors felt the truth of the\r\nsaying that, next to defeat, the saddest thing is victory. Comrades and\r\nfriends by scores lay scattered through the forest. As soon as he could\r\nsnatch a moment's leisure, the overworked surgeon sent the dismal\r\ntidings to his wife: \"My dear brother Ephraim was killed by a ball\r\nthrough his head; poor brother Josiah's wound I fear will prove mortal;\r\npoor Captain Hawley is yet alive, though I did not think he would live\r\ntwo hours after bringing him in.\" Daniel Pomeroy was shot dead; and his\r\nbrother Seth wrote the news to his wife Rachel, who was just delivered\r\nof a child: \"Dear Sister, this brings heavy tidings; but let not your\r\nheart sink at the news, though it be your loss of a dear husband. Monday\r\nthe eighth instant was a memorable day; and truly you may say, had not\r\nthe Lord been on our side, we must all have been swallowed up. My\r\nbrother, being one that went out in the first engagement, received a\r\nfatal shot through the middle of the head.\" Seth Pomeroy found a moment\r\nto write also to his own wife, whom he tells that another attack is\r\nexpected; adding, in quaintly pious phrase: \"But as God hath begun to\r\nshow mercy, I hope he will go on to be gracious.\" Pomeroy was employed\r\nduring the next few days with four hundred men in what he calls \"the\r\nmelancholy piece of business\" of burying the dead. A letter-writer of\r\nthe time does not approve what was done on this occasion. \"Our people,\"\r\nhe says, \"not only buried the French dead, but buried as many of them as\r\nmight be without the knowledge of our Indians, to prevent their being\r\nscalped. This I call an excess of civility;\" his reason being that\r\nBraddock's dead soldiers had been left to the wolves.\r\n\r\nThe English loss in killed, wounded, and missing was two hundred and\r\nsixty-two;[315] and that of the French by their own account, two hundred\r\nand twenty-eight,[316]--a somewhat modest result of five hours'\r\nfighting. The English loss was chiefly in the ambush of the morning,\r\nwhere the killed greatly outnumbered the wounded, because those who fell\r\nand could not be carried away were tomahawked by Dieskau's Indians. In\r\nthe fight at the camp, both Indians and Canadians kept themselves so\r\nwell under cover that it was very difficult for the New England men to\r\npick them off, while they on their part lay close behind their row of\r\nlogs. On the French side, the regular officers and troops bore the brunt\r\nof the battle and suffered the chief loss, nearly all of the former and\r\nnearly half of the latter being killed or wounded.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 315: _Return of Killed, Wounded, and Missing at the Battle of\r\nLake George_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 316: _Doreil au Ministre, 20 Oct. 1755_. Surgeon Williams\r\ngives the English loss as two hundred and sixteen killed, and ninety-six\r\nwounded. Pomeroy thinks that the French lost four or five hundred.\r\nJohnson places their loss at four hundred.]\r\n\r\nJohnson did not follow up his success. He says that his men were tired.\r\nYet five hundred of them had stood still all day, and boats enough for\r\ntheir transportation were lying on the beach. Ten miles down the lake, a\r\npath led over a gorge of the mountains to South Bay, where Dieskau had\r\nleft his canoes and provisions. It needed but a few hours to reach and\r\ndestroy them; but no such attempt was made. Nor, till a week after, did\r\nJohnson send out scouts to learn the strength of the enemy at\r\nTiconderoga. Lyman strongly urged him to make an effort to seize that\r\nimportant pass; but Johnson thought only of holding his own position. \"I\r\nthink,\" he wrote, \"we may expect very shortly a more formidable attack.\"\r\nHe made a solid breastwork to defend his camp; and as reinforcements\r\narrived, set them at building a fort on a rising ground by the lake. It\r\nis true that just after the battle he was deficient in stores, and had\r\nnot bateaux enough to move his whole force. It is true, also, that he\r\nwas wounded, and that he was too jealous of Lyman to delegate the\r\ncommand to him; and so the days passed till, within a fortnight, his\r\nnimble enemy were entrenched at Ticonderoga in force enough to defy him.\r\n\r\nThe Crown Point expedition was a failure disguised under an incidental\r\nsuccess. The northern provinces, especially Massachusetts and\r\nConnecticut, did what they could to forward it, and after the battle\r\nsent a herd of raw recruits to the scene of action. Shirley wrote to\r\nJohnson from Oswego; declared that his reasons for not advancing were\r\ninsufficient, and urged him to push for Ticonderoga at once. Johnson\r\nreplied that he had not wagons enough, and that his troops were\r\nill-clothed, ill-fed, discontented, insubordinate and sickly. He\r\ncomplained that discipline was out of the question, because the officers\r\nwere chosen by popular election; that many of them were no better than\r\nthe men, unfit for command, and like so many \"heads of a mob.\"[317] The\r\nreinforcements began to come in, till, in October there were thirty-six\r\nhundred men in the camp; and as most of them wore summer clothing and\r\nhad but one thin domestic blanket, they were half frozen in the chill\r\nautumn nights.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 317: _Shirley to Johnson, 19 Sept. 1755. Ibid., 24 Sept. 1755.\r\nJohnson to Shirley, 22 Sept. 1755. Johnson to Phipps, 10 Oct. 1755_\r\n(Massachusetts Archives).]\r\n\r\nJohnson called a council of war; and as he was suffering from inflamed\r\neyes, and was still kept in his tent by his wound, he asked Lyman to\r\npreside,--not unwilling, perhaps, to shift the responsibility upon him.\r\nAfter several sessions and much debate, the assembled officers decided\r\nthat it was inexpedient to proceed.[318] Yet the army lay more than a\r\nmonth longer at the lake, while the disgust of the men increased daily\r\nunder the rains, frosts, and snows of a dreary November. On the\r\ntwenty-second, Chandler, chaplain of one of the Massachusetts regiments,\r\nwrote in the interleaved almanac that served him as a diary: \"The men\r\njust ready to mutiny. Some clubbed their firelocks and marched, but\r\nreturned back. Very rainy night. Miry water standing the tents. Very\r\ndistressing time among the sick.\" The men grew more and more unruly, and\r\nwent off in squads without asking leave. A difficult question arose: Who\r\nshould stay for the winter to garrison the new forts, and who should\r\ncommand them? It was settled at last that a certain number of soldiers\r\nfrom each province should be assigned to this ungrateful service, and\r\nthat Massachusetts should have the first officer, Connecticut the\r\nsecond, and New York the third. Then the camp broke up. \"Thursday the\r\n27th,\" wrote the chaplain in his almanac, \"we set out about ten of the\r\nclock, marched in a body, about three thousand, the wagons and baggage\r\nin the centre, our colonel much insulted by the way.\" The soldiers\r\ndispersed to their villages and farms, where in blustering winter\r\nnights, by the blazing logs of New England hearth-stones, they told\r\ntheir friends and neighbors the story of the campaign.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 318: _Reports of Council of War, 11-21 Oct. 1755_.]\r\n\r\nThe profit of it fell to Johnson. If he did not gather the fruits of\r\nvictory, at least he reaped its laurels. He was a courtier in his rough\r\nway. He had changed the name of Lac St. Sacrement to Lake George, in\r\ncompliment to the King.\r\n\r\nHe now changed that of Fort Lyman to Fort Edward, in compliment to one\r\nof the King's grandsons; and, in compliment to another, called his new\r\nfort at the lake, William Henry. Of General Lyman he made no mention in\r\nhis report of the battle, and his partisans wrote letters traducing\r\nthat brave officer; though Johnson is said to have confessed in private\r\nthat he owed him the victory. He himself found no lack of eulogists;\r\nand, to quote the words of an able but somewhat caustic and prejudiced\r\nopponent, \"to the panegyrical pen of his secretary, Mr. Wraxall, and the\r\n_sic volo sic jubeo_ of Lieutenant-Governor Delancey, is to be ascribed\r\nthat mighty renown which echoed through the colonies, reverberated to\r\nEurope, and elevated a raw, inexperienced youth into a kind of second\r\nMarlborough.[319] Parliament gave him five thousand pounds, and the King\r\nmade him a baronet.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 319: _Review of Military Operations in North America, in a\r\nLetter to a Nobleman_ (ascribed to William Livingston).\r\n\r\nOn the Battle of Lake George a mass of papers will be found in the _N.Y.\r\nCol. Docs._, Vols. VI. and X. Those in Vol. VI., taken chiefly from the\r\narchives of New York, consist of official and private letters, reports,\r\netc., on the English side. Those in Vol. X. are drawn chiefly from the\r\narchives of the French War Department, and include the correspondence of\r\nDieskau and his adjutant Montreuil. I have examined most of them in the\r\noriginal. Besides these I have obtained from the Archives de la Marine\r\nand other sources a number of important additional papers, which have\r\nnever been printed, including Vaudreuil's reports to the Minister of\r\nWar, and his strictures on Dieskau, whom he accuses of disobeying orders\r\nby dividing his force; also the translation of an English journal of the\r\ncampaign found in the pocket of a captured officer, and a long account\r\nof the battle sent by Bigot to the Minister of Marine, 4 Oct. 1755.\r\n\r\nI owe to the kindness of Theodore Pomeroy, Esq., a copy of the Journal\r\nof Lieutenant-Colonel Seth Pomeroy, whose letters are full of interest;\r\nas are those of Surgeon Williams, from the collection of William L.\r\nStone, Esq. The papers of Colonel Israel Williams, in the Library of the\r\nMassachusetts Historical Society, contain many other curious letters\r\nrelating to the campaign, extracts from some of which are given in the\r\ntext. One of the most curious records of the battle is _A\r\nProspective-Plan of the Battle near Lake George, with an Explanation\r\nthereof, containing a full, though short, History of that important\r\nAffair, by Samuel Blodget, occasionally at the Camp when the Battle was\r\nfought_. It is an engraving, printed at Boston soon after the fight, of\r\nwhich it gives a clear idea. Four years after, Blodget opened a shop in\r\nBoston, where, as appears by his advertisements in the newspapers, he\r\nsold \"English Goods, also English Hatts, etc.\" The engraving is\r\nreproduced in the _Documentary History of New York_, IV., and\r\nelsewhere. The _Explanation thereof_ is only to be found complete in the\r\noriginal. This, as well as the anonymous _Second Letter to a Friend_,\r\nalso printed at Boston in 1755, is excellent for the information it\r\ngives as to the condition of the ground where the conflict took place,\r\nand the position of the combatants. The unpublished Archives of\r\nMassachusetts; the correspondence of Sir William Johnson; the _Review of\r\nMilitary Operations in North America_; Dwight, _Travels in New England\r\nand New York_, III.; and Hoyt, _Antiquarian Researches on Indian\r\nWars,_--should also be mentioned. Dwight and Hoyt drew their information\r\nfrom aged survivors of the battle. I have repeatedly examined the\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nIn the odd effusion of the colonial muse called _Tilden's Poems, chiefly\r\nto Animate and Rouse the Soldiers, printed 1756_, is a piece styled _The\r\nChristian Hero, or New England's Triumphs_, beginning with the\r\ninvocation,--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"O Heaven, indulge my feeble Muse,\r\n    Teach her what numbers for to choose!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nand containing the following stanza:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Their Dieskau we from them detain,\r\n    While Canada aloud complains\r\n    And counts the numbers of their slain\r\n      and makes a dire complaint;\r\n    The Indians to their demon gods;\r\n    And with the French there's little odds,\r\n    While images receive their nods,\r\n    Invoking rotten saints.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10\r\n\r\n1755, 1756\r\n\r\nShirley. Border War\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe capture of Niagara was to finish the work of the summer. This alone\r\nwould have gained for England the control of the valley of the Ohio, and\r\nmade Braddock's expedition superfluous. One marvels at the\r\nshort-sightedness, the dissensions, the apathy which had left this key\r\nof the interior so long in the hands of France without an effort to\r\nwrest it from her. To master Niagara would be to cut the communications\r\nof Canada with the whole system of French forts and settlements in the\r\nWest, and leave them to perish like limbs of a girdled tree.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Shirley, in the flush of his new martial honors, was to\r\ntry his prentice hand at the work. The lawyer-soldier could plan a\r\ncampaign boldly and well. It remained to see how he would do his part\r\ntowards executing it. In July he arrived at Albany, the starting-point\r\nof his own expedition as well as that of Johnson. This little Dutch city\r\nwas an outpost of civilization. The Hudson, descending from the northern\r\nwilderness, connected it with the lakes and streams that formed the\r\nthoroughfare to Canada; while the Mohawk, flowing from the west, was a\r\nliquid pathway to the forest homes of the Five Nations. Before the war\r\nwas over, a little girl, Anne MacVicar, daughter of a Highland officer,\r\nwas left at Albany by her father, and spent several years there in the\r\nhouse of Mrs. Schuyler, aunt of General Schuyler of the Revolution. Long\r\nafter, married and middle-aged, she wrote down her recollections of the\r\nplace,--the fort on the hill behind; the great street, grassy and broad,\r\nthat descended thence to the river, with market, guardhouse, town hall,\r\nand two churches in the middle, and rows of quaint Dutch-built houses on\r\nboth sides, each detached from its neighbors, each with its well,\r\ngarden, and green, and its great overshadowing tree. Before every house\r\nwas a capacious porch, with seats where the people gathered in the\r\nsummer twilight; old men at one door, matrons at another, young men and\r\ngirls mingling at a third; while the cows with their tinkling bells came\r\nfrom the common at the end of the town, each stopping to be milked at\r\nthe door of its owner; and children, porringer in hand, sat on the\r\nsteps, watching the process and waiting their evening meal.\r\n\r\nSuch was the quiet picture painted on the memory of Anne MacVicar, and\r\nreproduced by the pen of Mrs. Ann Grant.[320] The patriarchal,\r\nsemi-rural town had other aspects, not so pleasing. The men were mainly\r\nengaged in the fur-trade, sometimes legally with the Five Nations, and\r\nsometimes illegally with the Indians of Canada,--an occupation which by\r\nno means tends to soften the character. The Albany Dutch traders were a\r\nrude, hard race, loving money, and not always scrupulous as to the means\r\nof getting it. Coming events, too, were soon to have their effect on\r\nthis secluded community. Regiments, red and blue, trumpets, drums,\r\nbanners, artillery trains, and all the din of war transformed its\r\npeaceful streets, and brought some attaint to domestic morals hitherto\r\ncommendable; for during the next five years Albany was to be the\r\nprincipal base of military operations on the continent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 320: _Memoirs of an American Lady_ (Mrs. Schuyler), Chap. VI.\r\nA genuine picture of colonial life, and a charming book, though far from\r\nbeing historically trustworthy. Compare the account of Albany in Kalm,\r\nII. 102.]\r\n\r\nShirley had left the place, and was now on his way up the Mohawk. His\r\nforce, much smaller than at first intended, consisted of the New Jersey\r\nregiment, which mustered five hundred men, known as the Jersey Blues,\r\nand of the fiftieth and fifty-first regiments, called respectively\r\nShirley's and Pepperell's. These, though paid by the King and counted as\r\nregulars, were in fact raw provincials, just raised in the colonies, and\r\nwearing their gay uniforms with an awkward, unaccustomed air. How they\r\ngloried in them may be gathered from a letter of Sergeant James Gray, of\r\nPepperell's, to his brother John: \"I have two Holland shirts, found me\r\nby the King, and two pair of shoes and two pair of worsted stockings; a\r\ngood silver-laced hat (the lace I could sell for four dollars); and my\r\nclothes is as fine scarlet broadcloth as ever you did see. A sergeant\r\nhere in the King's regiment is counted as good as an ensign with you;\r\nand one day in every week we must have our hair or wigs powdered.\"[321]\r\nMost of these gorgeous warriors were already on their way to Oswego,\r\ntheir first destination.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 321: _James Gray to John Gray, 11 July, 1755_.]\r\n\r\nShirley followed, embarking at the Dutch village of Schenectady, and\r\nascending the Mohawk with about two hundred of the so-called regulars in\r\nbateaux. They passed Fort Johnson, the two villages of the Mohawks, and\r\nthe Palatine settlement of German Flats; left behind the last trace of\r\ncivilized man, rowed sixty miles through wilderness, and reached the\r\nGreat Carrying Place, which divided the waters that flow to the Hudson\r\nfrom those that flow to Lake Ontario. Here now stands the city which the\r\nclassic zeal of its founders has adorned with the name of Rome. Then all\r\nwas swamp and forest, traversed by a track that led to Wood\r\nCreek,--which is not to be confounded with the Wood Creek of Lake\r\nChamplain. Thither the bateaux were dragged on sledges and launched on\r\nthe dark and tortuous stream, which, fed by a decoction of forest leaves\r\nthat oozed from the marshy shores, crept in shadow through depths of\r\nfoliage, with only a belt of illumined sky gleaming between the jagged\r\ntree-tops. Tall and lean with straining towards the light, their rough,\r\ngaunt stems trickling with perpetual damps, stood on either hand the\r\nsilent hosts of the forest. The skeletons of their dead, barkless,\r\nblanched, and shattered, strewed the mudbanks and shallows; others lay\r\nsubmerged, like bones of drowned mammoths, thrusting lank, white limbs\r\nabove the sullen water; and great trees, entire as yet, were flung by\r\nage or storms athwart the current,--a bristling barricade of matted\r\nboughs. There was work for the axe as well as for the oar; till at\r\nlength Lake Oneida opened before them, and they rowed all day over its\r\nsunny breast, reached the outlet, and drifted down the shallow eddies of\r\nthe Onondaga, between walls of verdure, silent as death, yet haunted\r\neverywhere with ambushed danger. It was twenty days after leaving\r\nSchenectady when they neared the mouth of the river; and Lake Ontario\r\ngreeted them, stretched like a sea to the pale brink of the northern\r\nsky, while on the bare hill at their left stood the miserable little\r\nfort of Oswego.\r\n\r\nShirley's whole force soon arrived; but not the needful provisions and\r\nstores. The machinery of transportation and the commissariat was in the\r\nbewildered state inevitable among a peaceful people at the beginning of\r\na war; while the news of Braddock's defeat produced such an effect on\r\nthe boatmen and the draymen at the carrying-places, that the greater\r\npart deserted. Along with these disheartening tidings, Shirley learned\r\nthe death of his eldest son, killed at the side of Braddock. He had with\r\nhim a second son, Captain John Shirley, a vivacious young man, whom his\r\nfather and his father's friends in their familiar correspondence always\r\ncalled \"Jack.\" John Shirley's letters give a lively view of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\"I have sat down to write to you,\"--thus he addresses Governor Morris,\r\nof Pennsylvania, who seems to have had a great liking for him,--\"because\r\nthere is an opportunity of sending you a few lines; and if you will\r\npromise to excuse blots, interlineations, and grease (for this is\r\nwritten in the open air, upon the head of a pork-barrel, and twenty\r\npeople about me), I will begin another half-sheet. We are not more than\r\nabout fifteen hundred men fit for duty; but that I am pretty sure, if we\r\ncan go in time in our sloop, schooner, row-galleys, and whaleboats, will\r\nbe sufficient to take Frontenac; after which we may venture to go upon\r\nthe attack of Niagara, but not before. I have not the least doubt with\r\nmyself of knocking down both these places yet this fall, if we can get\r\naway in a week. If we take or destroy their two vessels at Frontenac,\r\nand ruin their harbor there, and destroy the two forts of that and\r\nNiagara, I shall think we have done great things. Nobody holds it out\r\nbetter than my father and myself. We shall all of us relish a good house\r\nover our heads, being all encamped, except the General and some few\r\nfield-officers, who have what are called at Oswego houses; but they\r\nwould in other countries be called only sheds, except the fort, where my\r\nfather is. Adieu, dear sir; I hope my next will be directed from\r\nFrontenac. Yours most affectionately, John Shirley.\"[322]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 322: The young author of this letter was, like his brother, a\r\nvictim of the war.\r\n\r\n\"Permit me, good sir, to offer you my hearty condolence upon the death\r\nof my friend Jack, whose worth I admired, and feel for him more than I\r\ncan express.... Few men of his age had so many friends.\" _Governor\r\nMorris to Shirley, 27 Nov. 1755_.\r\n\r\n\"My heart bleeds for Mr. Shirley. He must be overwhelmed with Grief when\r\nhe hears of Capt. John Shirley's Death, of which I have an Account by\r\nthe last Post from New York, where he died of a Flux and Fever that he\r\nhad contracted at Oswego. The loss of Two Sons in one Campaign scarcely\r\nadmits of Consolation. I feel the Anguish of the unhappy Father, and mix\r\nmy Tears very heartily with his. I have had an intimate Acquaintance\r\nwith Both of Them for many Years, and know well their inestimable\r\nValue.\" _Morris to Dinwiddie, 29 Nov. 1755_.]\r\n\r\nFort Frontenac lay to the northward, fifty miles or more across the\r\nlake. Niagara lay to the westward, at the distance of four or five days\r\nby boat or canoe along the south shore. At Frontenac there was a French\r\nforce of fourteen hundred regulars and Canadians.[323] They had vessels\r\nand canoes to cross the lake and fall upon Oswego as soon as Shirley\r\nshould leave it to attack Niagara; for Braddock's captured papers had\r\nrevealed to them the English plan. If they should take it, Shirley would\r\nbe cut off from his supplies and placed in desperate jeopardy, with the\r\nenemy in his rear. Hence it is that John Shirley insists on taking\r\nFrontenac before attempting Niagara. But the task was not easy; for the\r\nFrench force at the former place was about equal in effective strength\r\nto that of the English at Oswego. At Niagara, too, the French had, at\r\nthe end of August, nearly twelve hundred Canadians and Indians from Fort\r\nDuquesne and the upper lakes.[324] Shirley was but imperfectly informed\r\nby his scouts of the unexpected strength of the opposition that awaited\r\nhim; but he knew enough to see that his position was a difficult one.\r\nHis movement on Niagara was stopped, first by want of provisions, and\r\nsecondly because he was checkmated by the troops at Frontenac. He did\r\nnot despair. Want of courage was not among his failings, and he was but\r\ntoo ready to take risks. He called a council of officers, told them that\r\nthe total number of men fit for duty was thirteen hundred and\r\nseventy-six, and that as soon as provisions enough should arrive he\r\nwould embark for Niagara with six hundred soldiers and as many Indians\r\nas possible, leaving the rest to defend Oswego against the expected\r\nattack from Fort Frontenac.[325]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 323: _Bigot au Ministre, 27 Août, 1755_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 324: _Bigot au Ministre, 5 Sept. 1755_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 325: _Minutes of a Council of War at Oswego, 18 Sept. 1755_.]\r\n\r\n\"All I am uneasy about is our provisions,\" writes John Shirley to his\r\nfriend Morris; \"our men have been upon half allowance of bread these\r\nthree weeks past, and no rum given to 'em. My father yesterday called\r\nall the Indians together and made 'em a speech on the subject of General\r\nJohnson's engagement, which he calculated to inspire them with a spirit\r\nof revenge.\" After the speech he gave them a bullock for a feast, which\r\nthey roasted and ate, pretending that they were eating the Governor of\r\nCanada! Some provisions arriving, orders were given to embark on the\r\nnext day; but the officers murmured their dissent. The weather was\r\npersistently bad, their vessels would not hold half the party, and the\r\nbateaux, made only for river navigation, would infallibly founder on the\r\ntreacherous and stormy lake. \"All the field-officers,\" says John\r\nShirley, \"think it too rash an attempt; and I have heard so much of it\r\nthat I think it my duty to let my father know what I hear.\" Another\r\ncouncil was called; and the General, reluctantly convinced of the\r\ndanger, put the question whether to go or not. The situation admitted\r\nbut one reply. The council was of opinion that for the present the\r\nenterprise was impracticable; that Oswego should be strengthened, more\r\nvessels built, and preparation made to renew the attempt as soon as\r\nspring opened.[326] All thoughts of active operations were now\r\nsuspended, and during what was left of the season the troops exchanged\r\nthe musket for the spade, saw, and axe. At the end of October, leaving\r\nseven hundred men at Oswego, Shirley returned to Albany, and narrowly\r\nescaped drowning on the way, while passing a rapid in a whale-boat, to\r\ntry the fitness of that species of craft for river navigation.[327]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 326: _Minutes of a Council of War at Oswego, 27 Sept._ 1755.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 327: On the Niagara expedition, _Braddock's Instructions to\r\nMajor-General Shirley.

Connecticut_, II. 370.]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for him, he had fallen out with Johnson, whom he had made\r\nwhat he was, but who now turned against him,--a seeming ingratitude not\r\nwholly unprovoked. Shirley had diverted the New Jersey regiment,\r\ndestined originally for Crown Point, to his own expedition against\r\nNiagara. Naturally inclined to keep all the reins in his own hands, he\r\nhad encroached on Johnson's new office of Indian superintendent, held\r\nconferences with the Five Nations, and employed agents of his own to\r\ndeal with them. These agents were persons obnoxious to Johnson, being\r\nallied with the clique of Dutch traders at Albany, who hated him because\r\nhe had supplanted them in the direction of Indian affairs; and in a\r\nviolent letter to the Lords of Trade, he inveighs against their\r\n\"licentious and abandoned proceedings,\" \"villanous conduct,\" \"scurrilous\r\nfalsehoods,\" and \"base and insolent behavior.\"[328] \"I am considerable\r\nenough,\" he says, \"to have enemies and to be envied;\"[329] and he\r\ndeclares he has proof that Shirley told the Mohawks that he, Johnson,\r\nwas an upstart of his creating, whom he had set up and could pull down.\r\nAgain, he charges Shirley's agents with trying to \"debauch the Indians\r\nfrom joining him;\" while Shirley, on his side, retorts the same\r\ncomplaint against his accuser.[330] When, by the death of Braddock,\r\nShirley became commander-in-chief, Johnson grew so restive at being\r\nsubject to his instructions that he declined to hold the management of\r\nIndian affairs unless it was made independent of his rival. The dispute\r\nbecame mingled with the teapot-tempest of New York provincial politics.\r\nThe Lieutenant-Governor, Delancey, a politician of restless ambition and\r\nconsummate dexterity, had taken umbrage at Shirley, of whose rising\r\nhonors, not borne with remarkable humility, he appears to have been\r\njealous. Delancey had hitherto favored the Dutch faction in the\r\nAssembly, hostile to Johnson; but he now changed attitude, and joined\r\nhands with him against the object of their common dislike. The one was\r\nstrong in the prestige of a loudly-trumpeted victory, and the other had\r\nmeans of influence over the Ministry. Their coalition boded ill to\r\nShirley, and he soon felt its effects.[331]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 328: _Johnson to the Lords of Trade,_ 3 Sept. 1755.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 329: _Johnson to the Lords of Trade, 17 Jan_. 1756.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 330: _John Shirley to Governor Morris, 12 Aug_. 1755.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 331: On this affair, see various papers in _N.Y. Col. Docs_.,\r\nVI., VII. Smith, _Hist. New York_, Part II., Chaps. IV. V. _Review of\r\nMilitary Operations in North America_. Both Smith and Livingston, the\r\nauthor of the _Review_, were personally cognizant of the course of the\r\ndispute.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign was now closed,--a sufficiently active one, seeing that the\r\ntwo nations were nominally at peace. A disastrous rout on the\r\nMonongahela, failure at Niagara, a barren victory at Lake George, and\r\nthree forts captured in Acadia, were the disappointing results on the\r\npart of England. Nor had her enemies cause to boast. The Indians, it is\r\ntrue, had won a battle for them: but they had suffered mortifying defeat\r\nfrom a raw militia; their general was a prisoner; and they had lost\r\nAcadia past hope.\r\n\r\nThe campaign was over; but not its effects. It remains to see what\r\nbefell from the rout of Braddock and the unpardonable retreat of Dunbar\r\nfrom the frontier which it was his duty to defend. Dumas had replaced\r\nContrecoeur in the command of Fort Duquesne; and his first care was to\r\nset on the Western tribes to attack the border settlements. His success\r\nwas triumphant. The Delawares and Shawanoes, old friends of the English,\r\nbut for years past tending to alienation through neglect and ill-usage,\r\nnow took the lead against them. Many of the Mingoes, or Five Nation\r\nIndians on the Ohio, also took up the hatchet, as did various remoter\r\ntribes. The West rose like a nest of hornets, and swarmed in fury\r\nagainst the English frontier. Such was the consequence of the defeat of\r\nBraddock aided by the skilful devices of the French commander. \"It is by\r\nmeans such as I have mentioned,\" says Dumas, \"varied in every form to\r\nsuit the occasion, that I have succeeded in ruining the three adjacent\r\nprovinces, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, driving off the\r\ninhabitants, and totally destroying the settlements over a tract of\r\ncountry thirty leagues wide, reckoning from the line of Fort Cumberland.\r\nM. de Contrecoeur had not been gone a week before I had six or seven\r\ndifferent war-parties in the field at once, always accompanied by\r\nFrenchmen. Thus far, we have lost only two officers and a few soldiers;\r\nbut the Indian villages are full of prisoners of every age and sex. The\r\nenemy has lost far more since the battle than on the day of his\r\ndefeat.\"[332]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 332: _Dumas au Ministre, 24 Juillet, 1756._]\r\n\r\nDumas, required by the orders of his superiors to wage a detestable\r\nwarfare against helpless settlers and their families, did what he could\r\nto temper its horrors, and enjoined the officers who went with the\r\nIndians to spare no effort to prevent them from torturing\r\nprisoners.[333] The attempt should be set down to his honor; but it did\r\nnot avail much. In the record of cruelties committed this year on the\r\nborders, we find repeated instances of children scalped alive. \"They\r\nkill all they meet,\" writes a French priest; \"and after having abused\r\nthe women and maidens, they slaughter or burn them.\"[334]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 333: _Mémoires de Famille de l'Abbé Casgrain_, cited in _Le\r\nFoyer Canadien,_ III. 26, where an extract is given from an order of\r\nDumas to Baby, a Canadian officer. Orders of Contrecoeur and Ligneris to\r\nthe same effect are also given. A similar order, signed by Dumas, was\r\nfound in the pocket of Douville, an officer killed by the English on the\r\nFrontier. _Writings of Washington_, II. 137, _note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 334: _Rec. Claude Godefroy Cocquard, S.J., à son Frère, Mars\r\n(?)_, 1757.]\r\n\r\nWashington was now in command of the Virginia regiment, consisting of a\r\nthousand men, raised afterwards to fifteen hundred. With these he was to\r\nprotect a frontier of three hundred and fifty miles against more\r\nnumerous enemies, who could choose their time and place of attack. His\r\nheadquarters were at Winchester. His men were an ungovernable crew,\r\nenlisted chiefly on the turbulent border, and resenting every kind of\r\ndiscipline as levelling them with negroes; while the sympathizing House\r\nof Burgesses hesitated for months to pass any law for enforcing\r\nobedience, lest it should trench on the liberties of free white men. The\r\nservice was to the last degree unpopular. \"If we talk of obliging men to\r\nserve their country,\" wrote London Carter, \"we are sure to hear a fellow\r\nmumble over the words 'liberty' and 'property' a thousand times.\"[335]\r\nThe people, too, were in mortal fear of a slave insurrection, and\r\ntherefore dared not go far from home.[336] Meanwhile a panic reigned\r\nalong the border. Captain Waggoner, passing a gap in the Blue Ridge,\r\ncould hardly make his way for the crowd of fugitives. \"Every day,\"\r\nwrites Washington, \"we have accounts of such cruelties and barbarities\r\nas are shocking to human nature. It is not possible to conceive the\r\nsituation and danger of this miserable country. Such numbers of French\r\nand Indians are all around that no road is safe.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 335: Extract in _Writings of Washington_, II. 145, _note._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 336: _Letters of Dinwiddie_, 1755.]\r\n\r\nThese frontiers had always been at peace. No forts of refuge had thus\r\nfar been built, and the scattered settlers had no choice but flight.\r\nTheir first impulse was to put wife and children beyond reach of the\r\ntomahawk. As autumn advanced, the invading bands grew more and more\r\naudacious. Braddock had opened a road for them by which they could cross\r\nthe mountains at their ease; and scouts from Fort Cumberland reported\r\nthat this road was beaten by as many feet as when the English army\r\npassed last summer. Washington was beset with difficulties. Men and\r\nofficers alike were unruly and mutinous. He was at once blamed for their\r\ndisorders and refused the means of repressing them. Envious detractors\r\npublished slanders against him. A petty Maryland captain, who had once\r\nhad a commission from the King, refused to obey his orders, and stirred\r\nup factions among his officers. Dinwiddie gave him cold support. The\r\ntemper of the old Scotchman, crabbed at the best, had been soured by\r\ndisappointment, vexation, weariness, and ill-health. He had, besides, a\r\nfriend and countryman, Colonel Innes, whom, had he dared, he would\r\ngladly have put in Washington's place. He was full of zeal in the common\r\ncause, and wanted to direct the defence of the borders from his house at\r\nWilliamsburg, two hundred miles distant. Washington never hesitated to\r\nobey; but he accompanied his obedience by a statement of his own\r\nconvictions and his reasons for them, which, though couched in terms the\r\nmost respectful, galled his irascible chief. The Governor acknowledged\r\nhis merit; but bore him no love, and sometimes wrote to him in terms\r\nwhich must have tried his high temper to the utmost. Sometimes, though\r\nrarely, he gave words to his emotion.\r\n\r\n\"Your Honor,\" he wrote in April, \"may see to what unhappy straits the\r\ndistressed inhabitants and myself are reduced. I see inevitable\r\ndestruction in so clear a light, that unless vigorous measures are taken\r\nby the Assembly, and speedy assistance sent from below, the poor\r\ninhabitants that are now in forts must unavoidably fall, while the\r\nremainder are flying before the barbarous foe. In fine, the melancholy\r\nsituation of the people; the little prospect of assistance; the gross\r\nand scandalous abuse cast upon the officers in general, which is\r\nreflecting upon me in particular for suffering misconduct of such\r\nextraordinary kinds; and the distant prospect, if any, of gaining honor\r\nand reputation in the service,--cause me to lament the hour that gave me\r\na commission, and would induce me at any other time than this of\r\nimminent danger to resign, without one hesitating moment, a command from\r\nwhich I never expect to reap either honor or benefit, but, on the\r\ncontrary, have almost an absolute certainty of incurring displeasure\r\nbelow, while the murder of helpless families may be laid to my account\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The supplicating tears of the women and moving petitions of the men\r\nmelt me into such deadly sorrow, that I solemnly declare, if I know my\r\nown mind, I could offer myself a willing sacrifice to the butchering\r\nenemy, provided that would contribute to the people's ease.\"[337]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 337: _Writings of Washington_, II. 143.]\r\n\r\nIn the turmoil around him, patriotism and public duty seemed all to be\r\ncentred in the breast of one heroic youth. He was respected and\r\ngenerally beloved, but he did not kindle enthusiasm. His were the\r\nqualities of an unflagging courage, an all-enduring fortitude, and a\r\ndeep trust. He showed an astonishing maturing of character, and the kind\r\nof mastery over others which begins with mastery over self. At\r\ntwenty-four he was the foremost man, and acknowledged as such, along the\r\nwhole long line of the western border.\r\n\r\nTo feel the situation, the nature of these frontiers must be kept in\r\nmind. Along the skirts of the southern and middle colonies ran for six\r\nor seven hundred miles a loose, thin, dishevelled fringe of population,\r\nthe half-barbarous pioneers of advancing civilization. Their rude\r\ndwellings were often miles apart. Buried in woods, the settler lived in\r\nan appalling loneliness. A low-browed cabin of logs, with moss stuffed\r\nin the chinks to keep out the wind, roof covered with sheets of bark,\r\nchimney of sticks and clay, and square holes closed by a shutter in\r\nplace of windows; an unkempt matron, lean with hard work, and a brood of\r\nchildren with bare heads and tattered garments eked out by\r\ndeer-skin,--such was the home of the pioneer in the remoter and wilder\r\ndistricts. The scene around bore witness to his labors. It was the\r\nrepulsive transition from savagery to civilization, from the forest to\r\nthe farm. The victims of his axe lay strewn about the dismal \"clearing\"\r\nin a chaos of prostrate trunks, tangled boughs, and withered leaves,\r\nwaiting for the fire that was to be the next agent in the process of\r\nimprovement; while around, voiceless and grim, stood the living forest,\r\ngazing on the desolation, and biding its own day of doom. The owner of\r\nthe cabin was miles away, hunting in the woods for the wild turkey and\r\nvenison which were the chief food of himself and his family till the\r\nsoil could be tamed into the bearing of crops.\r\n\r\nTowards night he returned; and as he issued from the forest shadows he\r\nsaw a column of blue smoke rising quietly in the still evening air. He\r\nran to the spot; and there, among the smouldering logs of his dwelling,\r\nlay, scalped and mangled, the dead bodies of wife and children. A\r\nwar-party had passed that way. Breathless, palpitating, his brain on\r\nfire, he rushed through the thickening night to carry the alarm to his\r\nnearest neighbor, three miles distant.\r\n\r\nSuch was the character and the fate of many incipient settlements of the\r\nutmost border. Farther east, they had a different aspect. Here, small\r\nfarms with well-built log-houses, cattle, crops of wheat and Indian\r\ncorn, were strung at intervals along some woody valley of the lower\r\nAlleghanies: yesterday a scene of hardy toil; to-day swept with\r\ndestruction from end to end. There was no warning; no time for concert,\r\nperhaps none for flight. Sudden as the leaping panther, a pack of human\r\nwolves burst out of the forest, did their work, and vanished.\r\n\r\nIf the country had been an open one, like the plains beyond the\r\nMississippi, the situation would have been less frightful; but the\r\nforest was everywhere, rolled over hill and valley in billows of\r\ninterminable green,--a leafy maze, a mystery of shade, a universal\r\nhiding-place, where murder might lurk unseen at its victim's side, and\r\nNature seemed formed to nurse the mind with wild and dark imaginings.\r\nThe detail of blood is set down in the untutored words of those who saw\r\nand felt it. But there was a suffering that had no record,--the mortal\r\nfear of women and children in the solitude of their wilderness homes,\r\nhaunted, waking and sleeping, with nightmares of horror that were but\r\nthe forecast of an imminent reality. The country had in past years been\r\nso peaceful, and the Indians so friendly, that many of the settlers,\r\nespecially on the Pennsylvanian border, had no arms, and were doubly in\r\nneed of help from the Government. In Virginia they had it, such as it\r\nwas. In Pennsylvania they had for months none whatever; and the Assembly\r\nturned a deaf ear to their cries.\r\n\r\nFar to the east, sheltered from danger, lay staid and prosperous\r\nPhiladelphia, the home of order and thrift. It took its stamp from the\r\nQuakers, its original and dominant population, set apart from the other\r\ncolonists not only in character and creed, but in the outward symbols of\r\na peculiar dress and a daily sacrifice of grammar on the altar of\r\nreligion. The even tenor of their lives counteracted the effects of\r\nclimate, and they are said to have been perceptibly more rotund in\r\nfeature and person than their neighbors. Yet, broad and humanizing as\r\nwas their faith, they were capable of extreme bitterness towards\r\nopponents, clung tenaciously to power, and were jealous for the\r\nascendency of their sect, which had begun to show signs of wavering. On\r\nother sects they looked askance; and regarded the Presbyterians in\r\nparticular with a dislike which in moments of crisis rose to\r\ndetestation.[338] They held it sin to fight, and above all to fight\r\nagainst Indians.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 338: See a crowd of party pamphlets, Quaker against\r\nPresbyterian, which appeared in Philadelphia in 1764, abusively\r\nacrimonious on both sides.]\r\n\r\nHere was one cause of military paralysis. It was reinforced by another.\r\nThe old standing quarrel between governor and assembly had grown more\r\nviolent than ever; and this as a direct consequence of the public\r\ndistress, which above all things demanded harmony. The dispute turned\r\nthis time on a single issue,--that of the taxation of the proprietary\r\nestates. The estates in question consisted of vast tracts of wild land,\r\nyielding no income, and at present to a great extent worthless, being\r\noverrun by the enemy.[339] The Quaker Assembly had refused to protect\r\nthem; and on one occasion had rejected an offer of the proprietaries to\r\njoin them in paying the cost of their defence.[340] But though they\r\nwould not defend the land, they insisted on taxing it; and farther\r\ninsisted that the taxes upon it should be laid by the provincial\r\nassessors. By a law of the province, these assessors were chosen by\r\npopular vote; and in consenting to this law, the proprietaries had\r\nexpressly provided that their estates should be exempted from all taxes\r\nto be laid by officials in whose appointment they had no voice.[341]\r\nThomas and Richard Penn, the present proprietaries, had debarred their\r\ndeputy, the Governor, both by the terms of his commission and by special\r\ninstruction, from consenting to such taxation, and had laid him under\r\nheavy bonds to secure his obedience. Thus there was another side to the\r\nquestion than that of the Assembly; though our American writers have\r\nbeen slow to acknowledge it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 339: The productive estates of the proprietaries were taxed\r\nthrough the tenants.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 340: The proprietaries offered to contribute to the cost of\r\nbuilding and maintaining a fort on the spot where the French soon after\r\nbuilt Fort Duquesne. This plan, vigorously executed, would have saved\r\nthe province from a deluge of miseries. One of the reasons assigned by\r\nthe Assembly for rejecting it was that it would irritate the enemy. See\r\n_supra_, p. 63.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 341: _A Brief View of the Conduct of Pennsylvania for the year\r\n1755_.]\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin was leader in the Assembly and shared its views. The\r\nfeudal proprietorship of the Penn family was odious to his democratic\r\nnature. It was, in truth, a pestilent anomaly, repugnant to the genius\r\nof the people; and the disposition and character of the present\r\nproprietaries did not tend to render it less vexatious. Yet there were\r\nconsiderations which might have tempered the impatient hatred with which\r\nthe colonists regarded it. The first proprietary, William Penn, had used\r\nhis feudal rights in the interest of a broad liberalism; and through\r\nthem had established the popular institutions and universal tolerance\r\nwhich made Pennsylvania the most democratic province in America, and\r\nnursed the spirit of liberty which now revolted against his heirs. The\r\none absorbing passion of Pennsylvania was resistance of their deputy,\r\nthe Governor. The badge of feudalism, though light, was insufferably\r\nirritating; and the sons of William Penn were moreover detested by the\r\nQuakers as renegades from the faith of their father. Thus the immediate\r\npolitical conflict engrossed mind and heart; and in the rancor of their\r\nquarrel with the proprietaries, the Assembly forgot the French and\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nIn Philadelphia and the eastern districts the Quakers could ply their\r\ntrades, tend their shops, till their farms, and discourse at their ease\r\non the wickedness of war. The midland counties, too, were for the most\r\npart tolerably safe. They were occupied mainly by crude German peasants,\r\nwho nearly equalled in number all the rest of the population, and who,\r\ngathered at the centre of the province, formed a mass politically\r\nindigestible. Translated from servitude to the most ample liberty, they\r\nhated the thought of military service, which reminded them of former\r\noppression, cared little whether they lived under France or England,\r\nand, thinking themselves out of danger, had no mind to be taxed for the\r\ndefence of others. But while the great body of the Germans were\r\nsheltered from harm, those of them who lived farther westward were not\r\nso fortunate. Here, mixed with Scotch Irish Presbyterians and Celtic\r\nIrish Catholics, they formed a rough border population, the discordant\r\nelements of which could rarely unite for common action; yet, though\r\nconfused and disjointed, they were a living rampart to the rest of the\r\ncolony. Against them raged the furies of Indian war; and, maddened with\r\ndistress and terror, they cried aloud for help.\r\n\r\nPetition after petition came from the borders for arms and ammunition,\r\nand for a militia law to enable the people to organize and defend\r\nthemselves. The Quakers resisted. \"They have taken uncommon pains,\"\r\nwrites Governor Morris to Shirley, \"to prevent the people from taking up\r\narms.\"[342] Braddock's defeat, they declared, was a just judgment on him\r\nand his soldiers for molesting the French in their settlements on the\r\nOhio.[343] A bill was passed by the Assembly for raising fifty thousand\r\npounds for the King's use by a tax which included the proprietary lands.\r\nThe Governor, constrained by his instructions and his bonds, rejected\r\nit. \"I can only say,\" he told them, \"that I will readily pass a bill for\r\nstriking any sum in paper money the present exigency may require,\r\nprovided funds are established for sinking the same in five years.\"\r\nMessages long and acrimonious were exchanged between the parties. The\r\nAssembly, had they chosen, could easily have raised money enough by\r\nmethods not involving the point in dispute; but they thought they saw in\r\nthe crisis a means of forcing the Governor to yield. The Quakers had an\r\nalternative motive: if the Governor gave way, it was a political\r\nvictory; if he stood fast, their non-resistance principles would\r\ntriumph, and in this triumph their ascendency as a sect would be\r\nconfirmed. The debate grew every day more bitter and unmannerly. The\r\nGovernor could not yield; the Assembly would not. There was a complete\r\ndeadlock. The Assembly requested the Governor \"not to make himself the\r\nhateful instrument of reducing a free people to the abject state of\r\nvassalage.\"[344] As the raising of money and the control of its\r\nexpenditure was in their hands; as he could not prorogue or dissolve\r\nthem, and as they could adjourn on their own motion to such time as\r\npleased them; as they paid his support, and could withhold it if he\r\noffended them,--which they did in the present case,--it seemed no easy\r\ntask for him to reduce them to vassalage. \"What must we do,\" pursued the\r\nAssembly, \"to please this kind governor, who takes so much pains to\r\nrender us obnoxious to our sovereign and odious to our fellow-subjects?\r\nIf we only tell him that the difficulties he meets with are not owing to\r\nthe causes he names,--which indeed have no existence,--but to his own\r\nwant of skill and abilities for his station, he takes it extremely\r\namiss, and say 'we forget all decency to those in authority.' We are apt\r\nto think there is likewise some decency due to the Assembly as a part of\r\nthe government; and though we have not, like the Governor, had a courtly\r\neducation, but are plain men, and must be very imperfect in our\r\npoliteness, yet we think we have no chance of improving by his\r\nexample.\"[345] Again, in another Message, the Assembly, with a thrust at\r\nMorris himself, tell him that colonial governors have often been\r\n\"transient persons, of broken fortunes, greedy of money, destitute of\r\nall concern for those they govern, often their enemies, and endeavoring\r\nnot only to oppress, but to defame them.\"[346] In such unseemly fashion\r\nwas the battle waged. Morris, who was himself a provincial, showed more\r\ntemper and dignity; though there was not too much on either side. \"The\r\nAssembly,\" he wrote to Shirley, \"seem determined to take advantage of\r\nthe country's distress to get the whole power of government into their\r\nown hands.\" And the Assembly proclaimed on their part that the Governor\r\nwas taking advantage of the country's distress to reduce the province to\r\n\"Egyptian bondage.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 342: _Morris to Shirley, 16 Aug. 1755_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 343: _Morris to Sir Thomas Robinson, 28 Aug. 1755._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 344: _Colonial Records of Pa_., VI. 584.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 345: _Message of the Assembly to the Governor, 29 Sept. 1755_\r\n(written by Franklin), in _Colonial Records of Pa._, VI. 631, 632.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 346: _Writings of Franklin_, III. 447. The Assembly at first\r\nsuppressed this paper, but afterwards printed it.]\r\n\r\nPetitions poured in from the miserable frontiersmen. \"How long will\r\nthose in power, by their quarrels, suffer us to be massacred?\" demanded\r\nWilliam Trent, the Indian trader. \"Two and forty bodies have been buried\r\non Patterson's Creek; and since they have killed more, and keep on\r\nkilling.\"[347] Early in October news came that a hundred persons had\r\nbeen murdered near Fort Cumberland. Repeated tidings followed of murders\r\non the Susquehanna; then it was announced that the war-parties had\r\ncrossed that stream, and were at their work on the eastern side. Letter\r\nafter letter came from the sufferers, bringing such complaints as this:\r\n\"We are in as bad circumstances as ever any poor Christians were ever\r\nin; for the cries of widowers, widows, fatherless and motherless\r\nchildren, are enough to pierce the most hardest of hearts. Likewise it's\r\na very sorrowful spectacle to see those that escaped with their lives\r\nwith not a mouthful to eat, or bed to lie on, or clothes to cover their\r\nnakedness, or keep them warm, but all they had consumed into ashes.\r\nThese deplorable circumstances cry aloud for your Honor's most wise\r\nconsideration; for it is really very shocking for the husband to see the\r\nwife of his bosom her head cut off, and the children's blood drunk like\r\nwater, by these bloody and cruel savages.\"[348]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 347: _Trent to James Burd, 4 Oct. 1755_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 348: _Adam Hoops to Governor Morris, 3 Nov. 1755._]\r\n\r\nMorris was greatly troubled. \"The conduct of the Assembly,\" he wrote to\r\nShirley, \"is to me shocking beyond parallel.\" \"The inhabitants are\r\nabandoning their plantations, and we are in a dreadful situation,\" wrote\r\nJohn Harris from the east bank of the Susquehanna. On the next day he\r\nwrote again: \"The Indians are cutting us off every day, and I had a\r\ncertain account of about fifteen hundred Indians, besides French, being\r\non their march against us and Virginia, and now close on our borders,\r\ntheir scouts scalping our families on our frontiers daily.\" The report\r\nwas soon confirmed; and accounts came that the settlements in the valley\r\ncalled the Great Cove had been completely destroyed. All this was laid\r\nbefore the Assembly. They declared the accounts exaggerated, but\r\nconfessed that outrages had been committed; hinted that the fault was\r\nwith the proprietaries; and asked the Governor to explain why the\r\nDelawares and Shawanoes had become unfriendly. \"If they have suffered\r\nwrongs,\" said the Quakers, \"we are resolved to do all in our power to\r\nredress them, rather than entail upon ourselves and our posterity the\r\ncalamities of a cruel Indian war.\" The Indian records were searched, and\r\nseveral days spent in unsuccessful efforts to prove fraud in a late\r\nland-purchase.\r\n\r\nPost after post still brought news of slaughter. The upper part of\r\nCumberland County was laid waste. Edward Biddle wrote from Reading: \"The\r\ndrum is beating and bells ringing, and all the people under arms. This\r\nnight we expect an attack. The people exclaim against the Quakers.\" \"We\r\nseem to be given up into the hands of a merciless enemy,\" wrote John\r\nElder from Paxton. And he declares that more than forty persons have\r\nbeen killed in that neighborhood, besides numbers carried off. Meanwhile\r\nthe Governor and Assembly went on fencing with words and exchanging\r\nlegal subtleties; while, with every cry of distress that rose from the\r\nwest, each hoped that the other would yield.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth of November the Assembly laid before Morris for his\r\nconcurrence a bill for emitting bills of credit to the amount of sixty\r\nthousand pounds, to be sunk in four years by a tax including the\r\nproprietary estates.[349] \"I shall not,\" he replied, \"enter into a\r\ndispute whether the proprietaries ought to be taxed or not. It is\r\nsufficient for me that they have given me no power in that case; and I\r\ncannot think it consistent either with my duty or safety to exceed the\r\npowers of my commission, much less to do what that commission expressly\r\nprohibits.\"[350] He stretched his authority, however, so far as to\r\npropose a sort of compromise by which the question should be referred to\r\nthe King; but they refused it; and the quarrel and the murders went on\r\nas before. \"We have taken,\" said the Assembly, \"every step in our power\r\nconsistent with the just rights of the freemen of Pennsylvania, for the\r\nrelief of the poor distressed inhabitants; and we have reason to believe\r\nthat they themselves would not wish us to go farther. Those who would\r\ngive up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve\r\nneither liberty nor safety.\"[351] Then the borderers deserved neither;\r\nfor, rather than be butchered, they would have let the proprietary lands\r\nlie untaxed for another year. \"You have in all,\" said the Governor,\r\n\"proposed to me five money bills, three of them rejected because\r\ncontrary to royal instructions; the other two on account of the unjust\r\nmethod proposed for taxing the proprietary estate. If you are disposed\r\nto relieve your country, you have many other ways of granting money to\r\nwhich I shall have no objection. I shall put one proof more both of your\r\nsincerity and mine in our professions of regard for the public, by\r\noffering to agree to any bill in the present exigency which it is\r\nconsistent with my duty to pass; lest, before our present disputes can\r\nbe brought to an issue, we should neither have a privilege to dispute\r\nabout, nor a country to dispute in.\"[352] They stood fast; and with an\r\nobstinacy for which the Quakers were chiefly answerable, insisted that\r\nthey would give nothing, except by a bill taxing real estate, and\r\nincluding that of the proprietaries.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 349: _Colonial Records of Pa_., VI. 682.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 350: _Message of the Governor to the Assembly, 8 Nov. 1755_,\r\nin _Colonial Records of Pa._, VI. 684.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 351: _Message of the Assembly to the Governor, 11 Nov. Ibid._\r\nVI. 692. The words are Franklin's.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 352: _Message of the Governor to the Assembly, 22 Nov. 1755_,\r\nin _Colonial Records of Pa._, VI. 714.]\r\n\r\nBut now the Assembly began to feel the ground shaking under their feet.\r\nA paper, called a \"Representation,\" signed by some of the chief\r\ncitizens, was sent to the House, calling for measures of defence. \"You\r\nwill forgive us, gentlemen,\" such was its language, \"if we assume\r\ncharacters somewhat higher than that of humble suitors praying for the\r\ndefence of our lives and properties as a matter of grace or favor on\r\nyour side. You will permit us to make a positive and immediate demand of\r\nit.\"[353] This drove the Quakers mad. Preachers, male and female,\r\nharangued in the streets, denouncing the iniquity of war. Three of the\r\nsect from England, two women and a man, invited their brethren of the\r\nAssembly to a private house, and fervently exhorted them to stand firm.\r\nSome of the principal Quakers joined in an address to the House, in\r\nwhich they declared that any action on its part \"inconsistent with the\r\npeaceable testimony we profess and have borne to the world appears to us\r\nin its consequences to be destructive of our religious liberties.\"[354]\r\nAnd they protested that they would rather \"suffer\" than pay taxes for\r\nsuch ends. Consistency, even in folly, has in it something respectable;\r\nbut the Quakers were not consistent. A few years after, when heated\r\nwith party-passion and excited by reports of an irruption of incensed\r\nPresbyterian borderers, some of the pacific sectaries armed for battle;\r\nand the streets of Philadelphia beheld the curious conjunction of musket\r\nand broad-brimmed hat.[355]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 353: _Pennsylvania Archives_, II. 485.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 354: _Ibid_., II. 487.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 355: See _Conspiracy of Pontiac_, Chaps. 24 and 25.]\r\n\r\nThe mayor, aldermen, and common council next addressed the Assembly,\r\nadjuring them, \"in the most solemn manner, before God and in the name of\r\nall our fellow-citizens,\" to provide for defending the lives and\r\nproperty of the people.[356] A deputation from a band of Indians on the\r\nSusquehanna, still friendly to the province, came to ask whether the\r\nEnglish meant to fight or not; for, said their speaker, \"if they will\r\nnot stand by us, we will join the French.\" News came that the settlement\r\nof Tulpehocken, only sixty miles distant, had been destroyed; and then\r\nthat the Moravian settlement of Gnadenhütten was burned, and nearly all\r\nits inmates massacred. Colonel William Moore wrote to the Governor that\r\ntwo thousand men were coming from Chester County to compel him and the\r\nAssembly to defend the province; and Conrad Weiser wrote that more were\r\ncoming from Berks on the same errand. Old friends of the Assembly began\r\nto cry out against them. Even the Germans, hitherto their fast allies,\r\nwere roused from their attitude of passivity, and four hundred of them\r\ncame in procession to demand measures of war. A band of frontiersmen\r\npresently arrived, bringing in a wagon the bodies of friends and\r\nrelatives lately murdered, displaying them at the doors of the Assembly,\r\ncursing the Quakers, and threatening vengeance.[357]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 356: _A Remonstrance_, etc., in _Colonial Records of Pa._, VI.\r\n734.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 357: Mante, 47; Entick, I. 377.]\r\n\r\nFinding some concession necessary, the House at length passed a militia\r\nlaw,--probably the most futile ever enacted. It specially exempted the\r\nQuakers, and constrained nobody; but declared it lawful, for such as\r\nchose, to form themselves into companies and elect officers by ballot.\r\nThe company officers thus elected might, if they saw fit, elect, also\r\nby ballot, colonels, lieutenant-colonels, and majors. These last might\r\nthen, in conjunction with the Governor, frame articles of war; to which,\r\nhowever, no officer or man was to be subjected unless, after three days'\r\nconsideration, he subscribed them in presence of a justice of the peace,\r\nand declared his willingness to be bound by them.[358]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 358: This remarkable bill, drawn by Franklin, was meant for\r\npolitical rather than military effect. It was thought that Morris would\r\nrefuse to pass it, and could therefore be accused of preventing the\r\nprovince from defending itself; but he avoided the snare by signing it.]\r\n\r\nThis mockery could not appease the people; the Assembly must raise money\r\nfor men, arms, forts, and all the detested appliances of war. Defeat\r\nabsolute and ignominious seemed hanging over the House, when an incident\r\noccurred which gave them a decent pretext for retreat. The Governor\r\ninformed them that he had just received a letter from the proprietaries,\r\ngiving to the province five thousand pounds sterling to aid in its\r\ndefence, on condition that the money should be accepted as a free gift,\r\nand not as their proportion of any tax that was or might be laid by the\r\nAssembly. They had not learned the deplorable state of the country, and\r\nhad sent the money in view of the defeat of Braddock and its probable\r\nconsequences. The Assembly hereupon yielded, struck out from the bill\r\nbefore them the clause taxing the proprietary estates, and, thus\r\namended, presented it to the Governor, who by his signature made it a\r\nlaw.[359]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 359: _Minutes of Council, 27 Nov. 1755_.]\r\n\r\nThe House had failed to carry its point. The result disappointed\r\nFranklin, and doubly disappointed the Quakers. His maxim was: Beat the\r\nGovernor first, and then beat the enemy; theirs: Beat the Governor, and\r\nlet the enemy alone. The measures that followed, directed in part by\r\nFranklin himself, held the Indians in check, and mitigated the distress\r\nof the western counties; yet there was no safety for them throughout the\r\ntwo or three years when France was cheering on her hell-hounds against\r\nthis tormented frontier.\r\n\r\nAs in Pennsylvania, so in most of the other colonies there was conflict\r\nbetween assemblies and governors, to the unspeakable detriment of the\r\npublic service. In New York, though here no obnoxious proprietary stood\r\nbetween the people and the Crown, the strife was long and severe. The\r\npoint at issue was an important one,--whether the Assembly should\r\ncontinue their practice of granting yearly supplies to the Governor, or\r\nshould establish a permanent fund for the ordinary expenses of\r\ngovernment,--thus placing him beyond their control. The result was a\r\nvictory for the Assembly.\r\n\r\nMonth after month the great continent lay wrapped in snow. Far along the\r\nedge of the western wilderness men kept watch and ward in lonely\r\nblockhouses, or scoured the forest on the track of prowling war-parties.\r\nThe provincials in garrison at forts Edward, William Henry, and Oswego\r\ndragged out the dreary winter; while bands of New England rangers,\r\nmuffled against the piercing cold, caps of fur on their heads, hatchets\r\nin their belts, and guns in the mittened hands, glided on skates along\r\nthe gleaming ice-floor of Lake George, to spy out the secrets of\r\nTiconderoga, or seize some careless sentry to tell them tidings of the\r\nfoe. Thus the petty war went on; but the big war was frozen into torpor,\r\nready, like a hibernating bear, to wake again with the birds, the bees,\r\nand the flowers.[360]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 360: On Pennsylvanian disputes,--_A Brief State of the\r\nProvince of Pennsylvania_ (London, 1755). _A Brief View of the Conduct\r\nof Pennsylvania_ (London, 1756).

The last two works\r\nattack the first two with great vehemence. _The True and Impartial\r\nState_ is an able presentation of the case of the Assembly, omitting,\r\nhowever, essential facts. But the most elaborate work on the subject is\r\nthe _Historical Review of the Constitution and Government of\r\nPennsylvania_, inspired and partly written by Franklin. It is hotly\r\npartisan, and sometimes sophistical and unfair. Articles on the quarrel\r\nwill also be found in the provincial newspapers, especially the _New\r\nYork Mercury,_ and in the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for 1755 and 1756. But\r\nit is impossible to get any clear and just view of it without wading\r\nthrough the interminable documents concerning it in the _Colonial\r\nRecords of Pennsylvania_ and the _Pennsylvania Archives_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11\r\n\r\n1712-1756\r\n\r\nMontcalm\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth of May, 1756, England, after a year of open hostility,\r\nat length declared war. She had attacked France by land and sea, turned\r\nloose her ships to prey on French commerce, and brought some three\r\nhundred prizes into her ports. It was the act of a weak Government,\r\nsupplying by spasms of violence what it lacked in considerate\r\nresolution. France, no match for her amphibious enemy in the game of\r\nmarine depredation, cried out in horror; and to emphasize her complaints\r\nand signalize a pretended good faith which her acts had belied,\r\nostentatiously released a British frigate captured by her cruisers. She\r\nin her turn declared war on the ninth of June: and now began the most\r\nterrible conflict of the eighteenth century; one that convulsed Europe\r\nand shook America, India, the coasts of Africa, and the islands of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nIn Europe the ground was trembling already with the coming earthquake.\r\nSuch smothered discords, such animosities, ambitions, jealousies,\r\npossessed the rival governments; such entanglements of treaties and\r\nalliances, offensive or defensive, open or secret,--that a blow at one\r\npoint shook the whole fabric. Hanover, like the heel of Achilles, was\r\nthe vulnerable part for which England was always trembling. Therefore\r\nshe made a defensive treaty with Prussia, by which each party bound\r\nitself to aid the other, should its territory be invaded. England thus\r\nsought a guaranty against France, and Prussia against Russia. She had\r\nneed. Her King, Frederic the Great, had drawn upon himself an avalanche.\r\nThree women--two empresses and a concubine--controlled the forces of the\r\nthree great nations, Austria, Russia, and France; and they all hated\r\nhim: Elizabeth of Russia, by reason of a distrust fomented by secret\r\nintrigue and turned into gall by the biting tongue of Frederic himself,\r\nwho had jibed at her amours, compared her to Messalina, and called her\r\n\"_infâme catin du Nord_;\" Maria Theresa of Austria, because she saw in\r\nhim a rebellious vassal of the Holy Roman Empire, and, above all,\r\nbecause he had robbed her of Silesia; Madame de Pompadour, because when\r\nshe sent him a message of compliment, he answered, \"_Je ne la connais\r\npas_,\" forbade his ambassador to visit her, and in his mocking wit\r\nspared neither her nor her royal lover. Feminine pique, revenge, or\r\nvanity had then at their service the mightiest armaments of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe recovery of Silesia and the punishment of Frederic for his audacity\r\nin seizing it, possessed the mind of Maria Theresa with the force of a\r\nruling passion. To these ends she had joined herself in secret league\r\nwith Russia; and now at the prompting of her minister Kaunitz she\r\ncourted the alliance of France. It was a reversal of the hereditary\r\npolicy of Austria; joining hands with an old and deadly foe, and\r\nspurning England, of late her most trusty ally. But France could give\r\npowerful aid against Frederic; and hence Maria Theresa, virtuous as she\r\nwas high-born and proud, stooped to make advances to the all-powerful\r\nmistress of Louis XV., wrote her flattering letters, and addressed her,\r\nit is said, as \"_Ma chère cousine_.\" Pompadour was delighted, and could\r\nhardly do enough for her imperial friend. She ruled the King, and could\r\nmake and unmake ministers at will. They hastened to do her pleasure,\r\ndisguising their subserviency by dressing it out in specious reasons of\r\nstate. A conference at her summer-house, called Babiole, \"Bawble,\"\r\nprepared the way for a treaty which involved the nation in the\r\nanti-Prussian war, and made it the instrument of Austria in the attempt\r\nto humble Frederic,--an attempt which if successful would give the\r\nhereditary enemy of France a predominance over Germany. France engaged\r\nto aid the cause with twenty-four thousand men; but in the zeal of her\r\nrulers began with a hundred thousand. Thus the three great Powers stood\r\nleagued against Prussia. Sweden and Saxony joined them; and the Empire\r\nitself, of which Prussia was a part, took arms against its obnoxious\r\nmember.\r\n\r\nNever in Europe had power been more centralized, and never in France had\r\nthe reins been held by persons so pitiful, impelled by motives so\r\ncontemptible. The levity, vanity, and spite of a concubine became a\r\nmighty engine to influence the destinies of nations. Louis XV.,\r\nenervated by pleasures and devoured by _ennui_, still had his emotions;\r\nhe shared Pompadour's detestation of Frederic, and he was tormented at\r\ntimes by a lively fear of damnation. But how damn a king who had entered\r\nthe lists as champion of the Church? England was Protestant, and so was\r\nPrussia; Austria was supremely Catholic. Was it not a merit in the eyes\r\nof God to join her in holy war against the powers of heresy? The King of\r\nthe Parc-aux-Cerfs would propitiate Heaven by a new crusade.\r\n\r\nHenceforth France was to turn her strength against her European foes;\r\nand the American war, the occasion of the universal outbreak, was to\r\nhold in her eyes a second place. The reasons were several: the vanity of\r\nPompadour, infatuated by the advances of the Empress-Queen, and eager to\r\nsecure her good graces; the superstition of the King; the anger of both\r\nagainst Frederic; the desire of D'Argenson, minister of war, that the\r\narmy, and not the navy, should play the foremost part; and the passion\r\nof courtiers and nobles, ignorant of the naval service, to win laurels\r\nin a continental war,--all conspired to one end. It was the interest of\r\nFrance to turn her strength against her only dangerous rival; to\r\ncontinue as she had begun, in building up a naval power that could face\r\nEngland on the seas and sustain her own rising colonies in America,\r\nIndia, and the West Indies: for she too might have multiplied herself,\r\nplanted her language and her race over all the globe, and grown with the\r\ngrowth of her children, had she not been at the mercy of an effeminate\r\nprofligate, a mistress turned procuress, and the favorites to whom they\r\ndelegated power.\r\n\r\nStill, something must be done for the American war; at least there must\r\nbe a new general to replace Dieskau. None of the Court favorites wanted\r\na command in the backwoods, and the minister of war was free to choose\r\nwhom he would. His choice fell on Louis Joseph, Marquis de\r\nMontcalm-Gozon de Saint-Véran.\r\n\r\nMontcalm was born in the south of France, at the Château of Candiac,\r\nnear Nimes, on the twenty-ninth of February, 1712. At the age of six he\r\nwas placed in the charge of one Dumas, a natural son of his grandfather.\r\nThis man, a conscientious pedant, with many theories of education, ruled\r\nhis pupil stiffly; and, before the age of fifteen, gave him a good\r\nknowledge of Latin, Greek, and history. Young Montcalm had a taste for\r\nbooks, continued his reading in such intervals of leisure as camps and\r\ngarrisons afforded, and cherished to the end of his life the ambition of\r\nbecoming a member of the Academy. Yet, with all his liking for study, he\r\nsometimes revolted against the sway of the pedagogue who wrote letters\r\nof complaint to his father protesting against the \"judgments of the\r\nvulgar, who, contrary to the experience of ages, say that if children\r\nare well reproved they will correct their faults.\" Dumas, however, was\r\nnot without sense, as is shown by another letter to the elder Montcalm,\r\nin which he says that the boy had better be ignorant of Latin and Greek\r\n\"than know them as he does without knowing how to read, write, and speak\r\nFrench well.\" The main difficulty was to make him write a good hand,--a\r\npoint in which he signally failed to the day of his death. So refractory\r\nwas he at times, that his master despaired. \"M. de Montcalm,\" Dumas\r\ninforms the father, \"has great need of docility, industry, and\r\nwillingness to take advice. What will become of him?\" The pupil, aware\r\nof these aspersions, met them by writing to his father his own ideas of\r\nwhat his aims should be. \"First, to be an honorable man, of good\r\nmorals, brave, and a Christian. Secondly, to read in moderation; to know\r\nas much Greek and Latin as most men of the world; also the four rules of\r\narithmetic, and something of history, geography, and French and Latin\r\n_belles-lettres_, as well as to have a taste for the arts and sciences.\r\nThirdly, and above all, to be obedient, docile, and very submissive to\r\nyour orders and those of my dear mother; and also to defer to the advice\r\nof M. Dumas. Fourthly, to fence and ride as well as my small abilities\r\nwill permit.\"[361]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 361: This passage is given by Somervogel from the original\r\nletter.]\r\n\r\nIf Louis de Montcalm failed to satisfy his preceptor, he had a brother\r\nwho made ample amends. Of this infant prodigy it is related that at six\r\nyears he knew Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and had some acquaintance with\r\narithmetic, French history, geography, and heraldry. He was destined for\r\nthe Church, but died at the age of seven; his precocious brain having\r\nbeen urged to fatal activity by the exertions of Dumas.\r\n\r\nOther destinies and a more wholesome growth were the lot of young Louis.\r\nAt fifteen he joined the army as ensign in the regiment of Hainaut. Two\r\nyears after, his father bought him a captaincy, and he was first under\r\nfire at the siege of Philipsbourg. His father died in 1735, and left him\r\nheir to a considerable landed estate, much embarrassed by debt. The\r\nMarquis de la Fare, a friend of the family, soon after sought for him an\r\nadvantageous marriage to strengthen his position and increase his\r\nprospects of promotion; and he accordingly espoused Mademoiselle\r\nAngélique Louise Talon du Boulay,--a union which brought him influential\r\nalliances and some property. Madame de Montcalm bore him ten children,\r\nof whom only two sons and four daughters were living in 1752. \"May God\r\npreserve them all,\" he writes in his autobiography, \"and make them\r\nprosper for this world and the next! Perhaps it will be thought that the\r\nnumber is large for so moderate a fortune, especially as four of them\r\nare girls; but does God ever abandon his children in their need?\"\r\n\r\n   \"'Aux petits des oiseaux il donne la pâture,\r\n   Et sa bonté s'étend sur toute la nature.'\"\r\n\r\nHe was pious in his soldierly way, and ardently loyal to Church and\r\nKing.\r\n\r\nHis family seat was Candiac; where, in the intervals of campaigning, he\r\nfound repose with his wife, his children, and his mother, who was a\r\nwoman of remarkable force of character and who held great influence over\r\nher son. He had a strong attachment to this home of his childhood; and\r\nin after years, out of the midst of the American wilderness, his\r\nthoughts turned longingly towards it. \"_Quand reverrai-je mon cher\r\nCandiac_!\"\r\n\r\nIn 1741 Montcalm took part in the Bohemian campaign. He was made colonel\r\nof the regiment of Auxerrois two years later, and passed unharmed\r\nthrough the severe campaign of 1744. In the next year he fought in Italy\r\nunder Maréchal de Maillebois. In 1746, at the disastrous action under\r\nthe walls of Piacenza, where he twice rallied his regiment, he received\r\nfive sabre-cuts,--two of which were in the head,--and was made prisoner.\r\nReturning to France on parole, he was promoted in the year following to\r\nthe rank of brigadier; and being soon after exchanged, rejoined the\r\narmy, and was again wounded by a musket-shot. The peace of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle now gave him a period of rest.[362] At length, being on\r\na visit to Paris late in the autumn of 1755, the minister, D'Argenson,\r\nhinted to him that he might be appointed to command the troops in\r\nAmerica. He heard no more of the matter till, after his return home, he\r\nreceived from D'Argenson a letter dated at Versailles the twenty-fifth\r\nof January, at midnight. \"Perhaps, Monsieur,\" it began, \"you did not\r\nexpect to hear from me again on the subject of the conversation I had\r\nwith you the day you came to bid me farewell at Paris. Nevertheless I\r\nhave not forgotten for a moment the suggestion I then made you; and it\r\nis with the greatest pleasure that I announce to you that my views have\r\nprevailed. The King has chosen you to command his troops in North\r\nAmerica, and will honor you on your departure with the rank of\r\nmajor-general.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 362: The account of Montcalm up to this time is chiefly from\r\nhis unpublished autobiography, preserved by his descendants, and\r\nentitled _Mémoires pour servir à l'Histoire de ma Vie_. Somervogel,\r\n_Comme on servait autrefois_; Bonnechose, _Montcalm et le Canada;_\r\nMartin, _Le Marquis de Montcalm; Éloge de Montcalm; Autre Éloge de\r\nMontcalm; Mémoires sur le Canada_, 1749-1760, and other writings in\r\nprint and manuscript have also been consulted.]\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier de Lévis, afterwards Marshal of France, was named as his\r\nsecond in command, with the rank of brigadier, and the Chevalier de\r\nBourlamaque as his third, with the rank of colonel; but what especially\r\npleased him was the appointment of his eldest son to command a regiment\r\nin France. He set out from Candiac for the Court, and occupied himself\r\non the way with reading Charlevoix. \"I take great pleasure in it,\" he\r\nwrites from Lyons to his mother; \"he gives a pleasant account of Quebec.\r\nBut be comforted; I shall always be glad to come home.\" At Paris he\r\nwrites again: \"Don't expect any long letter from me before the first of\r\nMarch; all my business will be done by that time, and I shall begin to\r\nbreathe again. I have not yet seen the Chevalier de Montcalm [_his\r\nson_]. Last night I came from Versailles, and am going back to-morrow.\r\nThe King gives me twenty-five thousand francs a year, as he did to M.\r\nDieskau, besides twelve thousand for my equipment, which will cost me\r\nabove a thousand crowns more; but I cannot stop for that. I embrace my\r\ndearest and all the family.\" A few days later his son joined him. \"He is\r\nas thin and delicate as ever, but grows prodigiously tall.\"\r\n\r\nOn the second of March he informs his mother, \"My affairs begin to get\r\non. A good part of the baggage went off the day before yesterday in the\r\nKing's wagons; an assistant-cook and two liverymen yesterday. I have got\r\na good cook. Estève, my secretary, will go on the eighth; Joseph and\r\nDéjean will follow me. To-morrow evening I go to Versailles till Sunday,\r\nand will write from there to Madame de Montcalm [_his wife_]. I have\r\nthree aides-de-camp; one of them, Bougainville, a man of parts, pleasant\r\ncompany. Madame Mazade was happily delivered on Wednesday; in extremity\r\non Friday with a malignant fever; Saturday and yesterday, reports\r\nfavorable. I go there twice a day, and am just going now. She has a\r\ngirl. I embrace you all.\" Again, on the fifteenth: \"In a few hours I set\r\nout for Brest. Yesterday I presented my son, with whom I am well\r\npleased, to all the royal family. I shall have a secretary at Brest, and\r\nwill write more at length.\" On the eighteenth he writes from Rennes to\r\nhis wife: \"I arrived, dearest, this morning, and stay here all day. I\r\nshall be at Brest on the twenty-first. Everything will be on board on\r\nthe twenty-sixth. My son has been here since yesterday for me to coach\r\nhim and get him a uniform made, in which he will give thanks for his\r\nregiment at the same time that I take leave in my embroidered coat.\r\nPerhaps I shall leave debts behind. I wait impatiently for the bills.\r\nYou have my will; I wish you would get it copied, and send it to me\r\nbefore I sail.\"\r\n\r\nReaching Brest, the place of embarkation, he writes to his mother: \"I\r\nhave business on hand still. My health is good, and the passage will be\r\na time of rest. I embrace you, and my dearest, and my daughters. Love to\r\nall the family. I shall write up to the last moment.\"\r\n\r\nNo translation can give an idea of the rapid, abrupt, elliptical style\r\nof this familiar correspondence, where the meaning is sometimes\r\nsuggested by a single word, unintelligible to any but those for whom it\r\nis written.\r\n\r\nAt the end of March Montcalm, with all his following, was ready to\r\nembark; and three ships of the line, the \"Léopard,\" the \"Héros,\" and the\r\n\"Illustre,\" fitted out as transports, were ready to receive the troops;\r\nwhile the General, with Lévis and Bourlamaque, were to take passage in\r\nthe frigates \"Licorne,\" \"Sauvage,\" and \"Sirène.\" \"I like the Chevalier\r\nde Lévis,\" says Montcalm, \"and I think he likes me.\" His first\r\naide-de-camp, Bougainville, pleased him, if possible, still more. This\r\nyoung man, son of a notary, had begun life as an advocate in the\r\nParliament of Paris, where his abilities and learning had already made\r\nhim conspicuous, when he resigned the gown for the sword, and became a\r\ncaptain of dragoons. He was destined in later life to win laurels in\r\nanother career, and to become one of the most illustrious of French\r\nnavigators. Montcalm, himself a scholar, prized his varied talents and\r\naccomplishments, and soon learned to feel for him a strong personal\r\nregard.\r\n\r\nThe troops destined for Canada were only two battalions, one belonging\r\nto the regiment of La Sarre, and the other to that of Royal Roussillon.\r\nLouis XV. and Pompadour sent a hundred thousand men to fight the battles\r\nof Austria, and could spare but twelve hundred to reinforce New France.\r\nThese troops marched into Brest at early morning, breakfasted in the\r\ntown, and went at once on board the transports, \"with an incredible\r\ngayety,\" says Bougainville. \"What a nation is ours! Happy he who\r\ncommands it, and commands it worthily!\"[363] Montcalm and he embarked in\r\nthe \"Licorne,\" and sailed on the third of April, leaving Lévis and\r\nBourlamaque to follow a few days after.[364]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 363: _Journal de Bougainville_. This is a fragment; his\r\nJournal proper begins a few weeks later.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 364: _Lévis à----, 5 Avril_, 1756.]\r\n\r\nThe voyage was a rough one. \"I have been fortunate,\" writes Montcalm to\r\nhis wife, \"in not being ill nor at all incommoded by the heavy gale we\r\nhad in Holy Week. It was not so with those who were with me, especially\r\nM. Estève, my secretary, and Joseph, who suffered cruelly,--seventeen\r\ndays without being able to take anything but water. The season was very\r\nearly for such a hard voyage, and it was fortunate that the winter has\r\nbeen so mild. We had very favorable weather till Monday the twelfth; but\r\nsince then till Saturday evening we had rough weather, with a gale that\r\nlasted ninety hours, and put us in real danger. The forecastle was\r\nalways under water, and the waves broke twice over the quarter-deck.\r\nFrom the twenty-seventh of April to the evening of the fourth of May we\r\nhad fogs, great cold, and an amazing quantity of icebergs. On the\r\nthirtieth, when luckily the fog lifted for a time, we counted sixteen of\r\nthem. The day before, one drifted under the bowsprit, grazed it, and\r\nmight have crushed us if the deck-officer had not called out quickly,\r\n_Luff_. After speaking of our troubles and sufferings, I must tell you\r\nof our pleasures, which were fishing for cod and eating it. The taste is\r\nexquisite. The head, tongue, and liver are morsels worthy of an epicure.\r\nStill, I would not advise anybody to make the voyage for their sake. My\r\nhealth is as good as it has been for a long time. I found it a good plan\r\nto eat little and take no supper; a little tea now and then, and plenty\r\nof lemonade. Nevertheless I have taken very little liking for the sea,\r\nand think that when I shall be so happy as to rejoin you I shall end my\r\nvoyages there. I don't know when this letter will go. I shall send it by\r\nthe first ship that returns to France, and keep on writing till then. It\r\nis pleasant, I know, to hear particulars about the people one loves, and\r\nI thought that my mother and you, my dearest and most beloved, would be\r\nglad to read all these dull details. We heard Mass on Easter Day. All\r\nthe week before, it was impossible, because the ship rolled so that I\r\ncould hardly keep my legs. If I had dared, I think I should have had\r\nmyself lashed fast. I shall not soon forget that Holy Week.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was written on the eleventh of May, in the St. Lawrence,\r\nwhere the ship lay at anchor, ten leagues below Quebec, stopped by ice\r\nfrom proceeding farther. Montcalm made his way to the town by land, and\r\nsoon after learned with great satisfaction that the other ships were\r\nsafe in the river below. \"I see,\" he writes again, \"that I shall have\r\nplenty of work. Our campaign will soon begin. Everything is in motion.\r\nDon't expect details about our operations; generals never speak of\r\nmovements till they are over. I can only tell you that the winter has\r\nbeen quiet enough, though the savages have made great havoc in\r\nPennsylvania and Virginia, and carried off, according to their custom,\r\nmen, women, and children. I beg you will have High Mass said at\r\nMontpellier or Vauvert to thank God for our safe arrival and ask for\r\ngood success in future.\"[365]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 365: These extracts are translated from copies of the original\r\nletters, in possession of the present Marquis de Montcalm.]\r\n\r\nVaudreuil, the governor-general, was at Montreal, and Montcalm sent a\r\ncourier to inform him of his arrival. He soon went thither in person,\r\nand the two men met for the first time. The new general was not welcome\r\nto Vaudreuil, who had hoped to command the troops himself, and had\r\nrepresented to the Court that it was needless and inexpedient to send\r\nout a general officer from France.[366] The Court had not accepted his\r\nviews;[367] and hence it was with more curiosity than satisfaction that\r\nhe greeted the colleague who had been assigned him. He saw before him a\r\nman of small stature, with a lively countenance, a keen eye, and, in\r\nmoments of animation, rapid, vehement utterance, and nervous\r\ngesticulation. Montcalm, we may suppose, regarded the Governor with no\r\nless attention. Pierre François Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil, who had\r\ngoverned Canada early in the century; and he himself had been governor\r\nof Louisiana. He had not the force of character which his position\r\ndemanded, lacked decision in times of crisis; and though tenacious of\r\nauthority, was more jealous in asserting than self-reliant in exercising\r\nit. One of his traits was a sensitive egotism, which made him forward to\r\nproclaim his own part in every success, and to throw on others the\r\nburden of every failure. He was facile by nature, and capable of being\r\nled by such as had skill and temper for the task. But the impetuous\r\nMontcalm was not of their number; and the fact that he was born in\r\nFrance would in itself have thrown obstacles in his way to the good\r\ngraces of the Governor. Vaudreuil, Canadian by birth, loved the colony\r\nand its people, and distrusted Old France and all that came out of it.\r\nHe had been bred, moreover, to the naval service; and, like other\r\nCanadian governors, his official correspondence was with the minister of\r\nmarine, while that of Montcalm was with the minister of war. Even had\r\nNature made him less suspicious, his relations with the General would\r\nhave been critical. Montcalm commanded the regulars from France, whose\r\nvery presence was in the eyes of Vaudreuil an evil, though a necessary\r\none. Their chief was, it is true, subordinate to him in virtue of his\r\noffice of governor;[368] yet it was clear that for the conduct of the\r\nwar the trust of the Government was mainly in Montcalm; and the Minister\r\nof War had even suggested that he should have the immediate command, not\r\nonly of the troops from France, but of the colony regulars and the\r\nmilitia. An order of the King to this effect was sent to Vaudreuil, with\r\ninstructions to communicate it to Montcalm or withhold it, as he should\r\nthink best.[369] He lost no time in replying that the General \"ought to\r\nconcern himself with nothing but the command of the troops from France;\"\r\nand he returned the order to the minister who sent it.[370] The Governor\r\nand the General represented the two parties which were soon to divide\r\nCanada,--those of New France and of Old.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 366: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 30 Oct. 1755._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 367: _Ordres du Roy et Dépêches des Ministres, Fév. 1756._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 368: _Le Ministre à Vaudreuil, 15 Mars, 1756. Commission du\r\nMarquis de Montcalm. Mémoire du Roy pour servir d'Instruction au Marquis\r\nde Montcalm_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 369: _Ordres du Roy et Dépêches des Ministres, 1756. Le\r\nMinistre à Vaudreuil, 15 Mars, 1756_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 370: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 16 Juin, 1756_. \"Qu'il ne se mêle\r\nque du commandement des troupes de terre.\"]\r\n\r\nA like antagonism was seen in the forces commanded by the two chiefs.\r\nThese were of three kinds,--the _troupes de terre,_ troops of the line,\r\nor regulars from France; the _troupes de la marine_, or colony regulars;\r\nand lastly the militia. The first consisted of the four battalions that\r\nhad come over with Dieskau and the two that had come with Montcalm,\r\ncomprising in all a little less than three thousand men.[371] Besides\r\nthese, the battalions of Artois and Bourgogne, to the number of eleven\r\nhundred men, were in garrison at Louisbourg. All these troops wore a\r\nwhite uniform, faced with blue, red, yellow, or violet,[372] a black\r\nthree-cornered hat, and gaiters, generally black, from the foot to the\r\nknee. The subaltern officers in the French service were very numerous,\r\nand were drawn chiefly from the class of lesser nobles. A well-informed\r\nFrench writer calls them \"a generation of _petits-maîtres,_ dissolute,\r\nfrivolous, heedless, light-witted; but brave always, and ready to die\r\nwith their soldiers, though not to suffer with them.\"[373] In fact the\r\ncourse of the war was to show plainly that in Europe the regiments of\r\nFrance were no longer what they had once been. It was not so with those\r\nwho fought in America. Here, for enduring gallantry, officers and men\r\nalike deserve nothing but praise.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 371: Of about twelve hundred who came with Montcalm, nearly\r\nthree hundred were now in hospital. The four battalions that came with\r\nDieskau are reported at the end of May to have sixteen hundred and\r\nfifty-three effective men. _État de la Situation actuelle des\r\nBataillons,_ appended to Montcalm's despatch of 12 June. Another\r\ndocument, _Dêtail de ce qui s'est passé en Canada, Juin, 1755, jusqu'à\r\nJuin_, 1756, sets the united effective strength of the battalions in\r\nCanada at twenty-six hundred and seventy-seven, which was increased by\r\nrecruits which arrived from France about midsummer.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 372: Except perhaps, the battalion of Béarn, which formerly\r\nwore, and possibly wore still, a uniform of light blue.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 373: Susane, _Ancienne Infanterie Française_. In the atlas of\r\nthis work are colored plates of the uniforms of all the regiments of\r\nfoot.]\r\n\r\nThe _troupes de la marine_ had for a long time formed the permanent\r\nmilitary establishment of Canada. Though attached to the naval\r\ndepartment, they served on land, and were employed as a police within\r\nthe limits of the colony, or as garrisons of the outlying forts, where\r\ntheir officers busied themselves more with fur-trading than with their\r\nmilitary duties. Thus they had become ill-disciplined and inefficient,\r\ntill the hard hand of Duquesne restored them to order. They originally\r\nconsisted of twenty-eight independent companies, increased in 1750 to\r\nthirty companies, at first of fifty, and afterwards of sixty-five men\r\neach, forming a total of nineteen hundred and fifty rank and file. In\r\nMarch, 1757, ten more companies were added. Their uniform was not unlike\r\nthat of the troops attached to the War Department, being white, with\r\nblack facings. They were enlisted for the most part in France; but when\r\ntheir term of service expired, and even before, in time of peace, they\r\nwere encouraged to become settlers in the colony, as was also the case\r\nwith their officers, of whom a great part were of European birth. Thus\r\nthe relations of the _troupes de la marine_ with the colony were close;\r\nand formed a sort of connecting link between the troops of the line and\r\nthe native militia.[374] Besides these colony regulars, there was a\r\ncompany of colonial artillery, consisting this year of seventy men, and\r\nreplaced in 1757 by two companies of fifty men each.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 374: On the _troupes de la marine,--Mémoire pour servir\r\nd'Instruction a MM.

Ibid., 29 Fév. 1754.\r\nDuquesne à Marin, 27 Août, 1753. Atlas de Susane._]\r\n\r\nAll the effective male population of Canada, from fifteen years to\r\nsixty, was enrolled in the militia, and called into service at the will\r\nof the Governor. They received arms, clothing, equipment, and rations\r\nfrom the King, but no pay; and instead of tents they made themselves\r\nhuts of bark or branches. The best of them were drawn from the upper\r\nparts of the colony, where habits of bushranging were still in full\r\nactivity. Their fighting qualities were much like those of the Indians,\r\nwhom they rivalled in endurance and in the arts of forest war. As\r\nbush-fighters they had few equals; they fought well behind earthworks,\r\nand were good at a surprise or sudden dash; but for regular battle on\r\nthe open field they were of small account, being disorderly, and apt to\r\nbreak and take to cover at the moment of crisis. They had no idea of the\r\ngreat operations of war. At first they despised the regulars for their\r\nignorance of woodcraft, and thought themselves able to defend the colony\r\nalone; while the regulars regarded them in turn with a contempt no less\r\nunjust. They were excessively given to gasconade, and every true\r\nCanadian boasted himself a match for three Englishmen at least. In 1750\r\nthe militia of all ranks counted about thirteen thousand; and eight\r\nyears later the number had increased to about fifteen thousand.[375]\r\nUntil the last two years of the war, those employed in actual warfare\r\nwere but few. Even in the critical year 1758 only about eleven hundred\r\nwere called to arms, except for two or three weeks in summer;[376]\r\nthough about four thousand were employed in transporting troops and\r\nsupplies, for which service they received pay.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 375: _Récapitulation des Milices du Gouvernement de Canada_,\r\n1750. _Dénombrement des Milices_, 1758, 1759. On the militia, see also\r\nBougainville in Margry, _Rélations et Mémoires inédits_, 60, and _N.Y.\r\nCol. Docs._, X. 680.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 376: _Montcalm au Ministre_, _1 Sept. 1758._]\r\n\r\nTo the white fighting force of the colony are to be added the red men.\r\nThe most trusty of them were the Mission Indians, living within or near\r\nthe settled limits of Canada, chiefly the Hurons of Lorette, the\r\nAbenakis of St. Francis and Batiscan, the Iroquois of Caughnawaga and La\r\nPrésentation, and the Iroquois and Algonkins at the Two Mountains on the\r\nOttawa. Besides these, all the warriors of the west and north, from Lake\r\nSuperior to the Ohio, and from the Alleghanies to the Mississippi, were\r\nnow at the beck of France. As to the Iroquois or Five Nations who still\r\nremained in their ancient seats within the present limits of New York,\r\ntheir power and pride had greatly fallen; and crowded as they were\r\nbetween the French and the English, they were in a state of vacillation,\r\nsome leaning to one side, some to the other, and some to each in turn.\r\nAs a whole, the best that France could expect from them was neutrality.\r\n\r\nMontcalm at Montreal had more visits than he liked from his red allies.\r\n\"They are _vilains messieurs_,\" he informs his mother, \"even when fresh\r\nfrom their toilet, at which they pass their lives. You would not believe\r\nit, but the men always carry to war, along with their tomahawk and gun,\r\na mirror to daub their faces with various colors, and arrange feathers\r\non their heads and rings in their ears and noses. They think it a great\r\nbeauty to cut the rim of the ear and stretch it till it reaches the\r\nshoulder. Often they wear a laced coat, with no shirt at all. You would\r\ntake them for so many masqueraders or devils. One needs the patience of\r\nan angel to get on with them. Ever since I have been here, I have had\r\nnothing but visits, harangues, and deputations of these gentry. The\r\nIroquois ladies, who always take part in their government, came also,\r\nand did me the honor to bring me belts of wampum, which will oblige me\r\nto go to their village and sing the war-song. They are only a little way\r\noff. Yesterday we had eighty-three warriors here, who have gone out to\r\nfight. They make war with astounding cruelty, sparing neither men,\r\nwomen, nor children, and take off your scalp very neatly,--an operation\r\nwhich generally kills you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything is horribly dear in this country; and I shall find it hard\r\nto make the two ends of the year meet, with the twenty-five thousand\r\nfrancs the King gives me. The Chevalier de Lévis did not join me till\r\nyesterday. His health is excellent. In a few days I shall send him to\r\none camp, and M. de Bourlamaque to another; for we have three of them:\r\none at Carillon, eighty leagues from here, towards the place where M. de\r\nDieskau had his affair last year; another at Frontenac, sixty leagues;\r\nand the third at Niagara, a hundred and forty leagues. I don't know when\r\nor whither I shall go myself; that depends on the movements of the\r\nenemy. It seems to me that things move slowly in this new world; and I\r\nshall have to moderate my activity accordingly. Nothing but the King's\r\nservice and the wish to make a career for my son could prevent me from\r\nthinking too much of my expatriation, my distance from you, and the dull\r\nexistence here, which would be duller still if I did not manage to keep\r\nsome little of my natural gayety.\"\r\n\r\nThe military situation was somewhat perplexing. Iroquois spies had\r\nbrought reports of great preparations on the part of the English. As\r\nneither party dared offend these wavering tribes, their warriors could\r\npass with impunity from one to the other, and were paid by each for\r\nbringing information, not always trustworthy. They declared that the\r\nEnglish were gathering in force to renew the attempt made by Johnson the\r\nyear before against Crown Point and Ticonderoga, as well as that made by\r\nShirley against forts Frontenac and Niagara. Vaudreuil had spared no\r\neffort to meet the double danger. Lotbinière, a Canadian engineer, had\r\nbeen busied during the winter in fortifying Ticonderoga, while Pouchot,\r\na captain in the battalion of Béarn, had rebuilt Niagara, and two French\r\nengineers were at work in strengthening the defences of Frontenac. The\r\nGovernor even hoped to take the offensive, anticipate the movements of\r\nthe English, capture Oswego, and obtain the complete command of Lake\r\nOntario. Early in the spring a blow had been struck which materially\r\naided these schemes.\r\n\r\nThe English had built two small forts to guard the Great Carrying Place\r\non the route to Oswego. One of these, Fort Williams, was on the Mohawk;\r\nthe other, Fort Bull, a mere collection of storehouses surrounded by a\r\npalisade, was four miles distant, on the bank of Wood Creek. Here a\r\ngreat quantity of stores and ammunition had imprudently been collected\r\nagainst the opening campaign. In February Vaudreuil sent Léry, a colony\r\nofficer, with three hundred and sixty-two picked men, soldiers,\r\nCanadians, and Indians, to seize these two posts. Towards the end of\r\nMarch, after extreme hardship, they reached the road that connected\r\nthem, and at half-past five in the morning captured twelve men going\r\nwith wagons to Fort Bull. Learning from them the weakness of that place,\r\nthey dashed forward to surprise it. The thirty provincials of Shirley's\r\nregiment who formed the garrison had barely time to shut the gate, while\r\nthe assailants fired on them through the loopholes, of which they got\r\npossession in the tumult. Léry called on the defenders to yield; but\r\nthey refused, and pelted the French for an hour with bullets and\r\nhand-grenades. The gate was at last beat down with axes, and they were\r\nsummoned again; but again refused, and fired hotly through the opening.\r\nThe French rushed in, shouting _Vive le roi_, and a frightful struggle\r\nfollowed. All the garrison were killed, except two or three who hid\r\nthemselves till the slaughter was over; the fort was set on fire and\r\nblown to atoms by the explosion of the magazines; and Léry then\r\nwithdrew, not venturing to attack Fort Williams. Johnson, warned by\r\nIndians of the approach of the French, had pushed up the Mohawk with\r\nreinforcements; but came too late.[377]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 377: _Bigot au Ministre, 12 Avril, 1756.

Before the end of June this\r\nwas in good measure done. The battalion of Béarn lay encamped before the\r\nnow strong fort of Niagara, and the battalions of Guienne and La Sarre,\r\nwith a body of Canadians, guarded Frontenac against attack. Those of La\r\nReine and Languedoc had been sent to Ticonderoga, while the Governor,\r\nwith Montcalm and Lévis, still remained at Montreal watching the turn of\r\nevents.[378] Hither, too, came the intendant François Bigot, the most\r\naccomplished knave in Canada, yet indispensable for his vigor and\r\nexecutive skill; Bougainville, who had disarmed the jealousy of\r\nVaudreuil, and now stood high in his good graces; and the\r\nAdjutant-General, Montreuil, clearly a vain and pragmatic personage,\r\nwho, having come to Canada with Dieskau the year before, thought it\r\nbehooved him to give the General the advantage of his experience. \"I\r\nlike M. de Montcalm very much,\" he writes to the minister, \"and will do\r\nthe impossible to deserve his confidence. I have spoken to him in the\r\nsame terms as to M. Dieskau; thus: 'Trust only the French regulars for\r\nan expedition, but use the Canadians and Indians to harass the enemy.\r\nDon't expose yourself; send me to carry your orders to points of\r\ndanger.' The colony officers do not like those from France. The\r\nCanadians are independent, spiteful, lying, boastful; very good for\r\nskirmishing, very brave behind a tree, and very timid when not under\r\ncover. I think both sides will stand on the defensive. It does not seem\r\nto me that M. de Montcalm means to attack the enemy; and I think he is\r\nright. In this country a thousand men could stop three thousand.\"[379]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 378: _Correspondance de Montcalm, Vaudreuil, et Lévis._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 379: _Montreuil au Ministre, 12 Juin, 1756_. The original is\r\nin cipher.] \"M. de Vaudreuil overwhelms me with civilities,\" Montcalm\r\nwrites to the Minister of War. \"I think that he is pleased with my\r\nconduct towards him, and that it persuades him there are general\r\nofficers in France who can act under his orders without prejudice or\r\nill-humor.\"[380] \"I am on good terms with him,\" he says again; \"but not\r\nin his confidence, which he never gives to anybody from France. His\r\nintentions are good, but he is slow and irresolute.\"[381]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 380: _Montcalm au Ministre, 12 Juin, 1756._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 381: _Ibid., 19 Juin, 1756._ \"Je suis bien avec luy, sans sa\r\nconfiance, qu'il ne donne jamais à personne de la France.\" Erroneously\r\nrendered in _N.Y. Col. Docs._, X. 421.]\r\n\r\nIndians presently brought word that ten thousand English were coming to\r\nattack Ticonderoga. A reinforcement of colony regulars was at once\r\ndespatched to join the two battalions already there; a third battalion,\r\nRoyal Roussillon, was sent after them. The militia were called out and\r\nordered to follow with all speed, while both Montcalm and Lévis hastened\r\nto the supposed scene of danger.[382] They embarked in canoes on the\r\nRichelieu, coasted the shore of Lake Champlain, passed Fort Frederic or\r\nCrown Point, where all was activity and bustle, and reached Ticonderoga\r\nat the end of June. They found the fort, on which Lotbinière had been at\r\nwork all winter, advanced towards completion. It stood on the crown of\r\nthe promontory, and was a square with four bastions, a ditch, blown in\r\nsome parts out of the solid rock, bomb-proofs, barracks of stone, and a\r\nsystem of exterior defences as yet only begun. The rampart consisted of\r\ntwo parallel walls ten feet apart, built of the trunks of trees, and\r\nheld together by transverse logs dovetailed at both ends, the space\r\nbetween being filled with earth and gravel well packed.[383] Such was\r\nthe first Fort Ticonderoga, or Carillon,--a structure quite distinct\r\nfrom the later fort of which the ruins still stand on the same spot. The\r\nforest had been hewn away for some distance around, and the tents of the\r\nregulars and huts of the Canadians had taken its place; innumerable bark\r\ncanoes lay along the strand, and gangs of men toiled at the unfinished\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 382: _Montcalm au Ministre, 26 Juin, 1756. Détail de ce qui\r\ns'est passé, Oct. 1755 Juin, 1756._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 383: _Lotbinière au Ministre, 31 Oct. 1756. Montcalm au\r\nMinistre, 20 Juillet, 1756._]\r\n\r\nTiconderoga was now the most advanced position of the French, and Crown\r\nPoint, which had before held that perilous honor, was in the second\r\nline. Lévis, to whom had been assigned the permanent command of this\r\npost of danger, set out on foot to explore the neighboring woods and\r\nmountains, and slept out several nights before he reappeared at the\r\ncamp. \"I do not think,\" says Montcalm, \"that many high officers in\r\nEurope would have occasion to take such tramps as this. I cannot speak\r\ntoo well of him. Without being a man of brilliant parts, he has good\r\nexperience, good sense, and a quick eye; and, though I had served with\r\nhim before, I never should have thought that he had such promptness and\r\nefficiency. He has turned his campaigns to good account.\"[384] Lévis\r\nwrites of his chief with equal warmth. \"I do not know if the Marquis de\r\nMontcalm is pleased with me, but I am sure that I am very much so with\r\nhim, and shall always be charmed to serve under his orders. It is not\r\nfor me, Monseigneur, to speak to you of his merit and his talents. You\r\nknow him better than anybody else; but I may have the honor of assuring\r\nyou that he has pleased everybody in this colony, and manages affairs\r\nwith the Indians extremely well.\"[385]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 384: _Montcalm au Ministre, 20 Juillet, 1756._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 385: _Lévis au Ministre, 17 Juillet, 1756._]\r\n\r\nThe danger from the English proved to be still remote, and there was\r\nample leisure in the camp. Duchat, a young captain in the battalion of\r\nLanguedoc, used it in writing to his father a long account of what he\r\nsaw about him,--the forests full of game; the ducks, geese, and\r\npartridges; the prodigious flocks of wild pigeons that darkened the air,\r\nthe bears, the beavers; and above all the Indians, their canoes, dress,\r\nball-play, and dances. \"We are making here,\" says the military prophet,\r\n\"a place that history will not forget. The English colonies have ten\r\ntimes more people than ours; but these wretches have not the least\r\nknowledge of war, and if they go out to fight, they must abandon wives,\r\nchildren, and all that they possess. Not a week passes but the French\r\nsend them a band of _hairdressers_, whom they would be very glad to\r\ndispense with. It is incredible what a quantity of scalps they bring us.\r\nIn Virginia they have committed unheard-of cruelties, carried off\r\nfamilies, burned a great many houses, and killed an infinity of people.\r\nThese miserable English are in the extremity of distress, and repent too\r\nlate the unjust war they began against us. It is a pleasure to make war\r\nin Canada. One is troubled neither with horses nor baggage; the King\r\nprovides everything. But it must be confessed that if it costs no money,\r\none pays for it in another way, by seeing nothing but pease and bacon on\r\nthe mess-table. Luckily the lakes are full of fish, and both officers\r\nand soldiers have to turn fishermen.\"[386]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 386: _Relation de M. Duchat, Capitaine au Régiment de\r\nLanguedoc, écrite au Camp de Carillon, 15 Juillet, 1756._]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at the head of Lake George, the raw bands of ever-active New\r\nEngland were mustering for the fray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 12\r\n\r\n1756\r\n\r\nOswego\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, at the end of the last year, Shirley returned from his bootless\r\nOswego campaign, he called a council of war at New York and laid before\r\nit his scheme for the next summer's operations. It was a comprehensive\r\none: to master Lake Ontario by an overpowering naval force and seize the\r\nFrench forts upon it, Niagara, Frontenac, and Toronto; attack\r\nTiconderoga and Crown Point on the one hand, and Fort Duquesne on the\r\nother, and at the same time perplex and divide the enemy by an inroad\r\ndown the Chaudière upon the settlements about Quebec.[387] The council\r\napproved the scheme; but to execute it the provinces must raise at least\r\nsixteen thousand men. This they refused to do. Pennsylvania and Virginia\r\nwould take no active part, and were content with defending themselves.\r\nThe attack on Fort Duquesne was therefore abandoned, as was also the\r\ndiversion towards Quebec. The New England colonies were discouraged by\r\nJohnson's failure to take Crown Point, doubtful of the military\r\nabilities of Shirley, and embarrassed by the debts of the last campaign;\r\nbut when they learned that Parliament would grant a sum of money in\r\npartial compensation for their former sacrifices,[388] they plunged into\r\nnew debts without hesitation, and raised more men than the General had\r\nasked; though, with their usual jealousy, they provided that their\r\nsoldiers should be employed for no other purpose than the attack on\r\nTiconderoga and Crown Point. Shirley chose John Winslow to command them,\r\nand gave him a commission to that effect; while he, to clinch his\r\nauthority, asked and obtained supplementary commissions from every\r\ngovernment that gave men to the expedition.[389] For the movement\r\nagainst the fort of Lake Ontario, which Shirley meant to command in\r\nperson, he had the remains of his own and Pepperell's regiments, the two\r\nshattered battalions brought over by Braddock, the \"Jersey Blues,\" four\r\nprovincial companies from North Carolina, and the four King's companies\r\nof New York. His first care was to recruit their ranks and raise them to\r\ntheir full complement; which, when effected, would bring them up to the\r\ninsufficient strength of about forty-four hundred men.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 387: _Minutes of Council of War held at New York, 12 and 13\r\nDec. 1755.

The cabal formed against him, with Delancey at its head, had\r\nwon over Sir Charles Hardy, the new governor of New York, and had\r\npainted Shirley's conduct in such colors that the Ministry removed him.\r\nIt was essential for the campaign that a successor should be sent at\r\nonce, to form plans on the spot and make preparations accordingly. The\r\nMinistry were in no such haste. It was presently announced that Colonel\r\nDaniel Webb would be sent to America, followed by General James\r\nAbercromby; who was to be followed in turn by the Earl of Loudon, the\r\ndestined commander-in-chief. Shirley was to resign his command to Webb,\r\nWebb to Abercromby, and Abercromby to Loudon.[390] It chanced that the\r\ntwo former arrived in June at about the same time, while the Earl came\r\nin July; and meanwhile it devolved on Shirley to make ready for them.\r\nUnable to divine what their plans would be, he prepared the campaign in\r\naccordance with his own.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 390: _Fox to Shirley, 13 March, 1756.

Shirley to\r\nFox, 13 June, 1756._]\r\n\r\nHis star, so bright a twelvemonth before, was now miserably dimmed. In\r\nboth his public and private life he was the butt of adversity. He had\r\nlost two promising sons; he had made a mortifying failure as a soldier;\r\nand triumphant enemies were rejoicing in his fall. It is to the credit\r\nof his firmness and his zeal in the cause that he set himself to his\r\ntask with as much vigor as if he, and not others, were to gather the\r\nfruits. His chief care was for his favorite enterprise in the direction\r\nof Lake Ontario. Making Albany his headquarters, he rebuilt the fort at\r\nthe Great Carrying Place destroyed in March by the French, sent troops\r\nto guard the perilous route to Oswego, and gathered provisions and\r\nstores at the posts along the way.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the New England men, strengthened by the levies of New York,\r\nwere mustering at Albany for the attack of Crown Point. At the end of\r\nMay they moved a short distance up the Hudson, and encamped at a place\r\ncalled Half-Moon, where the navigation was stopped by rapids. Here and\r\nat the posts above were gathered something more than five thousand men,\r\nas raw and untrained as those led by Johnson in the summer before.[391]\r\nThe four New England colonies were much alike in their way of raising\r\nand equipping men, and the example of Massachusetts may serve for them\r\nall. The Assembly or \"General Court\" voted the required number, and\r\nchose a committee of war authorized to impress provisions, munitions,\r\nstores, clothing, tools, and other necessaries, for which fair prices\r\nwere to be paid within six months. The Governor issued a proclamation\r\ncalling for volunteers. If the full number did not appear within the\r\ntime named, the colonels of militia were ordered to muster their\r\nregiments, and immediately draft out of them men enough to meet the\r\nneed. A bounty of six dollars was offered this year to stimulate\r\nenlistment, and the pay of a private soldier was fixed at one pound six\r\nshillings a month, Massachusetts currency. If he brought a gun, he had\r\nan additional bounty of two dollars. A powderhorn, bullet-pouch,\r\nblanket, knapsack, and \"wooden bottle,\" or canteen, were supplied by the\r\nprovince; and if he brought no gun of his own, a musket was given him,\r\nfor which, as for the other articles, he was to account at the end of\r\nthe campaign. In the next year it was announced that the soldier should\r\nreceive, besides his pay, \"a coat and soldier's hat.\" The coat was of\r\ncoarse blue cloth, to which breeches of red or blue were afterwards\r\nadded. Along with his rations, he was promised a gill of rum each day, a\r\nprivilege of which he was extremely jealous, deeply resenting every\r\nabridgment of it. He was enlisted for the campaign, and could not be\r\nrequired to serve above a year at farthest.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 391: _Letter and Order Books of Winslow, 1756._]\r\n\r\nThe complement of a regiment was five hundred, divided into companies of\r\nfifty; and as the men and officers of each were drawn from the same\r\nneighborhood, they generally knew each other. The officers, though\r\nnominally appointed by the Assembly, were for the most part the virtual\r\nchoice of the soldiers themselves, from whom they were often\r\nindistinguishable in character and social standing. Hence discipline was\r\nweak. The pay--or, as it was called, the wages--of a colonel was twelve\r\npounds sixteen shillings, Massachusetts currency, a month; that of a\r\ncaptain, five pounds eight shillings,--an advance on the pay of the last\r\nyear; and that of a chaplain, six pounds eight shillings.[392] Penalties\r\nwere enacted against \"irreligion, immorality, drunkenness, debauchery,\r\nand profaneness.\" The ordinary punishments were the wooden horse, irons,\r\nor, in bad cases, flogging.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 392: _Vote of General Court, 26 Feb. 1756._]\r\n\r\nMuch difficulty arose from the different rules adopted by the various\r\ncolonies for the regulation of their soldiers. Nor was this the only\r\nsource of trouble. Besides its war committee, the Assembly of each of\r\nthe four New England colonies chose another committee \"for clothing,\r\narming, paying, victualling, and transporting\" its troops. They were to\r\ngo to the scene of operations, hire wagons, oxen, and horses, build\r\nboats and vessels, and charge themselves with the conveyance of all\r\nsupplies belonging to their respective governments. They were to keep in\r\ncorrespondence with the committee of war at home, to whom they were\r\nresponsible; and the officer commanding the contingent of their colony\r\nwas required to furnish them with guards and escorts. Thus four\r\nindependent committees were engaged in the work of transportation at the\r\nsame time, over the same roads, for the same object. Each colony chose\r\nto keep the control of its property in its own hands. The inconveniences\r\nwere obvious: \"I wish to God,\" wrote Lord Loudon to Winslow, \"you could\r\npersuade your people to go all one way.\" The committees themselves did\r\nnot always find their task agreeable. One of their number, John Ashley,\r\nof Massachusetts, writes in dudgeon to Governor Phipps: \"Sir, I am apt\r\nto think that things have been misrepresented to your Honor, or else I\r\nam certain I should not suffer in my character, and be styled a damned\r\nrascal, and ought to be put in irons, etc., when I am certain I have\r\nexerted myself to the utmost of my ability to expedite the business\r\nassigned me by the General Court.\" At length, late in the autumn, Loudon\r\npersuaded the colonies to forego this troublesome sort of independence,\r\nand turn over their stores to the commissary-general, receipts being\r\nduly given.[393]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 393: The above particulars are gathered from the voluminous\r\npapers in the State House at Boston, _Archives, Military_, Vols. LXXV.,\r\nLXXVI. These contain the military acts of the General Court,\r\nproclamations, reports of committees, and other papers relating to\r\nmilitary affairs in 1755 and 1756. The _Letter and Order Books of\r\nWinslow_, in the Library of the Massachusetts Historical Society, have\r\nsupplied much concurrent matter. See also _Colonial Records of R.I._,\r\nV., and _Provincial Papers of N.H._, VI.]\r\n\r\nFrom Winslow's headquarters at Half-Moon a road led along the banks of\r\nthe Hudson to Stillwater, whence there was water carriage to Saratoga.\r\nHere stores were again placed in wagons and carried several miles to\r\nUpper Falls; thence by boat to Fort Edward; and thence, fourteen miles\r\nacross country, to Fort William Henry at Lake George, where the army was\r\nto embark for Ticonderoga. Each of the points of transit below Fort\r\nEdward was guarded by a stockade and two or more companies of\r\nprovincials. They were much pestered by Indians, who now and then\r\nscalped a straggler, and escaped with their usual nimbleness. From time\r\nto time strong bands of Canadians and Indians approached by way of South\r\nBay or Wood Creek, and threatened more serious mischief. It is\r\nsurprising that some of the trains were not cut off, for the escorts\r\nwere often reckless and disorderly to the last degree. Sometimes the\r\ninvaders showed great audacity. Early in June Colonel Fitch at Albany\r\nscrawls a hasty note to Winslow: \"Friday, 11 o'clock: Sir, about half an\r\nhour since, a party of near fifty French and Indians had the impudence\r\nto come down to the river opposite to this city and captivate two men;\"\r\nand Winslow replies with equal quaintness: \"We daily discover the\r\nIndians about us; but not yet have been so happy as to obtain any of\r\nthem.\"[394]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 394: Vaudreuil, in his despatch of 12 August, gives\r\nparticulars of these raids, with an account of the scalps taken on each\r\noccasion. He thought the results disappointing.]\r\n\r\nColonel Jonathan Bagley commanded at Fort William Henry, where gangs of\r\nmen were busied under his eye in building three sloops and making\r\nseveral hundred whaleboats to carry the army of Ticonderoga. The season\r\nwas advancing fast, and Winslow urged him to hasten on the work; to\r\nwhich the humorous Bagley answered; \"Shall leave no stone unturned;\r\nevery wheel shall go that rum and human flesh can move.\"[395] A\r\nfortnight after he reports: \"I must really confess I have almost wore\r\nthe men out, poor dogs. Pray where are the committee, or what are they\r\nabout?\" He sent scouts to watch the enemy, with results not quite\r\nsatisfactory. \"There is a vast deal of news here; every party brings\r\nabundance, but all different.\" Again, a little later: \"I constantly keep\r\nout small scouting parties to the eastward and westward of the lake, and\r\nmake no discovery but the tracks of small parties who are plaguing us\r\nconstantly; but what vexes me most, we can't catch one of the sons\r\nof----. I have sent out skulking parties some distance from the sentries\r\nin the night, to lie still in the bushes to intercept them; but the\r\nflies are so plenty, our people can't bear them.\"[396] Colonel David\r\nWooster, at Fort Edward, was no more fortunate in his attempts to take\r\nsatisfaction on his midnight visitors; and reports that he has not thus\r\nfar been able \"to give those villains a dressing.\"[397] The English,\r\nhowever, were fast learning the art of forest war, and the partisan\r\nchief, Captain Robert Rogers, began already to be famous. On the\r\nseventeenth of June he and his band lay hidden in the bushes within the\r\noutposts of Ticonderoga, and made a close survey of the fort and\r\nsurrounding camps.[398] His report was not cheering. Winslow's so-called\r\narmy had now grown to nearly seven thousand men; and these, it was\r\nplain, were not too many to drive the French from their stronghold.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 395: _Bagley to Winslow, 2 July, 1756._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 396: _Ibid., 15 July, 1756._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 397: _Wooster to Winslow, 2 June, 1756._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 398: _Report of Rogers, 19 June, 1756._ Much abridged in his\r\npublished _Journals_.]\r\n\r\nWhile Winslow pursued his preparations, tried to settle disputes of rank\r\namong the colonels of the several colonies, and strove to bring order\r\nout of the little chaos of his command, Sir William Johnson was engaged\r\nin a work for which he was admirably fitted. This was the attaching of\r\nthe Five Nations to the English interest. Along with his patent of\r\nbaronetcy, which reached him about this time, he received, direct from\r\nthe Crown, the commission of \"Colonel, Agent, and Sole Superintendent of\r\nthe Six Nations and other Northern Tribes.\"[399] Henceforth he was\r\nindependent of governors and generals, and responsible to the Court\r\nalone. His task was a difficult one. The Five Nations would fain have\r\nremained neutral, and let the European rivals fight it out; but, on\r\naccount of their local position, they could not. The exactions and lies\r\nof the Albany traders, the frauds of land-speculators, the contradictory\r\naction of the different provincial governments, joined to English\r\nweakness and mismanagement in the last war, all conspired to alienate\r\nthem and to aid the efforts of the French agents, who cajoled and\r\nthreatened them by turns. But for Johnson these intrigues would have\r\nprevailed. He had held a series of councils with them at Fort Johnson\r\nduring the winter, and not only drew from them a promise to stand by the\r\nEnglish, but persuaded all the confederated tribes, except the Cayugas,\r\nto consent that the English should build forts near their chief towns,\r\nunder the pretext of protecting them from the French.[400]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 399: _Fox to Johnson, 13 March, 1756. Papers of Sir William\r\nJohnson._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 400: _Conferences between Sir William Johnson and the Indians,\r\nDec. 1755, to Feb. 1756_, in _N.Y. Col. Docs._, VII. 44-74. _Account of\r\nConferences held and Treaties made between Sir William Johnson, Bart.,\r\nand the Indian Nations of North America_ (London, 1756).]\r\n\r\nIn June he went to Onondaga, well escorted, for the way was dangerous.\r\nThis capital of the Confederacy was under a cloud. It had just lost one\r\nRed Head, its chief sachem; and first of all it behooved the baronet to\r\ncondole their affliction. The ceremony was long, with compliments,\r\nlugubrious speeches, wampum-belts, the scalp of an enemy to replace the\r\ndeparted, and a final glass of rum for each of the assembled mourners.\r\nThe conferences lasted a fortnight; and when Johnson took his leave, the\r\ntribes stood pledged to lift the hatchet for the English.[401]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 401: _Minutes of Councils of Onondaga, 19 June to 3 July,\r\n1756_, in _N.Y. Col. Docs._, VII. 134-150.]\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to Fort Johnson a fever seized him, and he lay helpless\r\nfor a time; then rose from his sick bed to meet another congregation of\r\nIndians. These were deputies of the Five Nations, with Mohegans from the\r\nHudson, and Delawares and Shawanoes from the Susquehanna, whom he had\r\npersuaded to visit him in hope that he might induce them to cease from\r\nmurdering the border settlers. All their tribesmen were in arms against\r\nthe English; but he prevailed at last, and they accepted the war-belt at\r\nhis hands. The Delawares complained that their old conquerors, the Five\r\nNations, had forced them \"to wear the petticoat,\" that is, to be counted\r\nnot as warriors but as women. Johnson, in presence of all the Assembly,\r\nnow took off the figurative garment, and pronounced them henceforth men.\r\nA grand war-dance followed. A hundred and fifty Mohawks, Oneidas,\r\nOnondagas, Delawares, Shawanoes, and Mohegans stamped, whooped, and\r\nyelled all night.[402] In spite of Piquet, the two Joncaires, and the\r\nrest of the French agents, Johnson had achieved a success. But would the\r\nIndians keep their word? It was more than doubtful. While some of them\r\ntreated with him on the Mohawk, others treated with Vaudreuil at\r\nMontreal.[403] A display of military vigor on the English side, crowned\r\nby some signal victory, would alone make their alliance sure.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 402: _Minutes of Councils at Fort Johnson, 9 July to 12 July_,\r\nin _N.Y. Col. Docs._, VII. 152-160.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 403: _Conferences between M. de Vaudreuil and the Five\r\nNations, 28 July to 20 Aug._, in _N.Y. Col. Docs._, X. 445-453.]\r\n\r\nIt was not the French only who thwarted the efforts of Johnson; for\r\nwhile he strove to make friends of the Delawares and Shawanoes, Governor\r\nMorris of Pennsylvania declared war against them, and Governor Belcher\r\nof New Jersey followed his example; though persuaded at last to hold his\r\nhand till the baronet had tried the virtue of pacific measures.[404]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 404: _Johnson to Lords of Trade, 28 May, 1756. Ibid., 17 July,\r\n1756. Johnson to Shirley, 24 April, 1756. Colonial Records of Pa._, VII.\r\n75, 88, 194.]\r\n\r\nWhat Shirley longed for was the collecting of a body of Five Nation\r\nwarriors at Oswego to aid him in his cherished enterprise against\r\nNiagara and Frontenac. The warriors had promised him to come; but there\r\nwas small hope that they would do so. Meanwhile he was at Albany\r\npursuing his preparations, posting his scanty force in the forts newly\r\nbuilt on the Mohawk and the Great Carrying Place, and sending forward\r\nstores and provisions. Having no troops to spare for escorts, he\r\ninvented a plan which, like everything he did, was bitterly criticised.\r\nHe took into pay two thousand boatmen, gathered from all parts of the\r\ncountry, including many whale-men from the eastern coasts of New\r\nEngland, divided them into companies of fifty, armed each with a gun and\r\na hatchet, and placed them under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel John\r\nBradstreet.[405] Thus organized, they would, he hoped, require no\r\nescort. Bradstreet was a New England officer who had been a captain in\r\nthe last war, somewhat dogged and self-opinioned, but brave, energetic,\r\nand well fitted for this kind of service.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 405: _Shirley to Fox, 7 May, 1756. Shirley to Abercromby, 27\r\nJune, 1756. London to Fox, 19 Aug. 1756._]\r\n\r\nIn May Vaudreuil sent Coulon de Villiers with eleven hundred soldiers,\r\nCanadians, and Indians, to harass Oswego and cut its communications with\r\nAlbany.[406] Nevertheless Bradstreet safely conducted a convoy of\r\nprovisions and military stores to the garrison; and on the third of July\r\nset out on his return with the empty boats. The party were pushing their\r\nway up the river in three divisions. The first of these, consisting of a\r\nhundred boats and three hundred men, with Bradstreet at their head, were\r\nabout nine miles from Oswego, when, at three in the afternoon, they\r\nreceived a heavy volley from the forest on the east bank. It was fired\r\nby a part of Villiers' command, consisting, by English accounts, of\r\nabout seven hundred men. A considerable number of the boatmen were\r\nkilled or disabled, and the others made for the shelter of the western\r\nshore. Some prisoners were taken in the confusion; and if the French had\r\nbeen content to stop here, they might fairly have claimed a kind of\r\nvictory; but, eager to push their advantage, they tried to cross under\r\ncover of an island just above. Bradstreet saw the movement, and landed\r\non the island with six or eight followers, among whom was young Captain\r\nSchuyler, afterwards General Schuyler of the Revolution. Their fire kept\r\nthe enemy in check till others joined them, to the number of about\r\ntwenty. These a second and a third time beat back the French, who now\r\ngave over the attempt, and made for another ford at some distance above.\r\nBradstreet saw their intention; and collecting two hundred and fifty\r\nmen, was about to advance up the west bank to oppose them, when Dr.\r\nKirkland, a surgeon, came to tell him that the second division of boats\r\nhad come up, and that the men had landed. Bradstreet ordered them to\r\nstay where they were, and defend the lower crossing: then hastened\r\nforward; but when he reached the upper ford, the French had passed the\r\nriver, and were ensconced in a pine-swamp near the shore. Here he\r\nattacked them; and both parties fired at each other from behind trees\r\nfor an hour, with little effect. Bradstreet at length encouraged his men\r\nto make a rush at the enemy, who were put to flight and driven into the\r\nriver, where many were shot or drowned as they tried to cross. Another\r\nparty of the French had meanwhile passed by a ford still higher up to\r\nsupport their comrades; but the fight was over before they reached the\r\nspot, and they in their turn were set upon and driven back across the\r\nstream. Half an hour after, Captain Patten arrived from Onondaga with\r\nthe grenadiers of Shirley's regiment; and late in the evening two\r\nhundred men came from Oswego to reinforce the victors. In the morning\r\nBradstreet prepared to follow the French to their camp, twelve miles\r\ndistant; but was prevented by a heavy rain which lasted all day. On the\r\nMonday following, he and his men reached Albany, bringing two prisoners,\r\neighty French muskets, and many knapsacks picked up in the woods. He had\r\nlost between sixty and seventy killed, wounded, and taken.[407]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 406: _Détail de ce qui s'est passé en Canada, Oct. 1755 Juin,\r\n1756_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 407: _Letter of J. Choate, Albany, 12 July, 1756_, in\r\nMassachusetts Archives, LV. _Three Letters from Albany, July, Aug.\r\n1756_, in _Doc.

Bradstreet's conduct on\r\nthis occasion afterwards gained for him the warm praises of Wolfe.]\r\n\r\nThis affair was trumpeted through Canada as a victory of the French.\r\nTheir notices of it are discordant, though very brief. One of them says\r\nthat Villiers had four hundred men. Another gives him five hundred, and\r\na third eight hundred, against fifteen hundred English, of whom they\r\nkilled eight hundred, or an Englishman apiece. A fourth writer boasts\r\nthat six hundred Frenchmen killed nine hundred English. A fifth contents\r\nhimself with four hundred; but thinks that forty more would have been\r\nslain if the Indians had not fired too soon. He says further that there\r\nwere three hundred boats; and presently forgetting himself, adds that\r\nfive hundred were taken or destroyed. A sixth announces a great capture\r\nof stores and provisions, though all the boats were empty. A seventh\r\nreports that the Canadians killed about three hundred, and would have\r\nkilled more but for the bad quality of their tomahawks. An eighth, with\r\nrare modesty, puts the English loss at fifty or sixty. That of Villiers\r\nis given in every proportion of killed or wounded, from one up to ten.\r\nThus was Canada roused to martial ardor, and taught to look for future\r\ntriumphs cheaply bought.[408]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 408: _Nouvelles du Camp établi au Portage de Chouaguen,\r\npremière Relation. Ibid., Séconde Relation, 10 Juillet, 1756_.\r\nBougainville, _Journal_, who gives the report as he heard it _Lettre du\r\nR.P. Cocquard, S.J., 1756. Vaudreuil au Ministre, 10 Juillet, 1756.\r\nUrsulines de Québec_, II. 292. _N.Y. Col. Docs._, X. 434, 467, 477, 483.\r\nSome prisoners taken in the first attack were brought to Montreal, where\r\ntheir presence gave countenance to these fabrications.]\r\n\r\nThe success of Bradstreet silenced for a time the enemies of Shirley.\r\nHis cares, however, redoubled. He was anxious for Oswego, as the two\r\nprisoners declared that the French meant to attack it, instead of\r\nwaiting to be attacked from it. Nor was the news from that quarter\r\nreassuring. The engineer, Mackellar, wrote that the works were incapable\r\nof defence; and Colonel Mercer, the commandant, reported general\r\ndiscontent in the garrison.[409] Captain John Vicars, an invalid officer\r\nof Shirley's regiment, arrived at Albany with yet more deplorable\r\naccounts. He had passed the winter at Oswego, where he declared the\r\ndearth of food to have been such that several councils of war had been\r\nheld on the question of abandoning the place from sheer starvation. More\r\nthan half his regiment died of hunger or disease; and, in his own words,\r\n\"had the poor fellows lived they must have eaten one another.\" Some of\r\nthe men were lodged in barracks, though without beds, while many lay all\r\nwinter in huts on the bare ground. Scurvy and dysentery made frightful\r\nhavoc. \"In January,\" says Vicars, \"we were informed by the Indians that\r\nwe were to be attacked. The garrison was then so weak that the strongest\r\nguard we proposed to mount was a subaltern and twenty men; but we were\r\nseldom able to mount more than sixteen or eighteen, and half of those\r\nwere obliged to have sticks in their hands to support them. The men were\r\nso weak that the sentries often fell down on their posts, and lay there\r\ntill the relief came and lifted them up.\" His own company of fifty was\r\nreduced to ten. The other regiment of the garrison, Pepperell's, or the\r\nfifty-first, was quartered at Fort Ontario, on the other side of the\r\nriver; and being better sheltered, suffered less.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 409: _Mackellar to Shirley, June, 1756. Mercer to Shirley, 2\r\nJuly, 1756._]\r\n\r\nThe account given by Vicars of the state of the defences was scarcely\r\nmore flattering. He reported that the principal fort had no cannon on\r\nthe side most exposed to attack. Two pieces had been mounted on the\r\ntrading-house in the centre; but as the concussion shook down the stones\r\nfrom the wall whenever they were fired, they had since been removed. The\r\nsecond work, called Fort Ontario, he had not seen since it was finished,\r\nhaving been too ill to cross the river. Of the third, called New Oswego,\r\nor \"Fort Rascal,\" he testifies thus: \"It never was finished, and there\r\nwere no loopholes in the stockades; so that they could not fire out of\r\nthe fort but by opening the gate and firing out of that.\"[410]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 410: _Information of Captain John Vicars, of the Fiftieth\r\n(Shirley's) Regiment,_ enclosed with a despatch of Lord Loudon. Vicars\r\nwas a veteran British officer who left Oswego with Bradstreet on the\r\nthird of July. _Shirley to Loudon, 5 Sept. 1756._]\r\n\r\nThrough the spring and early summer Shirley was gathering recruits,\r\noften of the meanest quality, and sending them to Oswego to fill out the\r\ntwo emaciated regiments. The place must be defended at any cost. Its\r\nfall would ruin not only the enterprise against Niagara and Frontenac,\r\nbut also that against Ticonderoga and Crown Point; since, having nothing\r\nmore to fear on Lake Ontario, the French could unite their whole force\r\non Lake Champlain, whether for defence or attack.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of June Abercromby and Webb arrived at Albany, bringing\r\na reinforcement of nine hundred regulars, consisting of Otway's\r\nregiment, or a part of it, and a body of Highlanders. Shirley resigned\r\nhis command, and Abercromby requested him to go to New York, wait there\r\ntill Lord Loudon arrived, and lay before him the state of affairs.[411]\r\nShirley waited till the twenty-third of July, when the Earl at length\r\nappeared. He was a rough Scotch lord, hot and irascible; and the\r\ncommunications of his predecessor, made, no doubt, in a manner somewhat\r\npompous and self-satisfied, did not please him. \"I got from\r\nMajor-General Shirley,\" he says, \"a few papers of very little use; only\r\nhe insinuated to me that I would find everything prepared, and have\r\nnothing to do but to pull laurels; which I understand was his constant\r\nconversation before my arrival.\"[412]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 411: _Shirley to Fox, 4 July, 1756._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 412: _Loudon (to Fox?), 19 Aug. 1756._]\r\n\r\nLoudon sailed up the Hudson in no placid mood. On reaching Albany he\r\nabandoned the attempt against Niagara and Frontenac; and had resolved to\r\nturn his whole force against Ticonderoga, when he was met by an obstacle\r\nthat both perplexed and angered him. By a royal order lately issued,\r\nall general and field officers with provincial commissions were to take\r\nrank only as eldest captains when serving in conjunction with regular\r\ntroops.[413] Hence the whole provincial army, as Winslow observes, might\r\nbe put under the command of any British major.[414] The announcement of\r\nthis regulation naturally caused great discontent. The New England\r\nofficers held a meeting, and voted with one voice that in their belief\r\nits enforcement would break up the provincial army and prevent the\r\nraising of another. Loudon, hearing of this, desired Winslow to meet him\r\nat Albany for a conference on the subject. Thither Winslow went with\r\nsome of his chief officers. The Earl asked them to dinner, and there was\r\nmuch talk, with no satisfactory result; whereupon, somewhat chafed, he\r\nrequired Winslow to answer in writing, yes or no, whether the provincial\r\nofficers would obey the commander-in-chief and act in conjunction with\r\nthe regulars. Thus forced to choose between acquiescence and flat\r\nmutiny, they declared their submission to his orders, at the same time\r\nasking as a favor that they might be allowed to act independently; to\r\nwhich Loudon gave for the present an unwilling assent. Shirley, who, in\r\nspite of his removal from command, had the good of the service deeply at\r\nheart, was much troubled at this affair, and wrote strong letters to\r\nWinslow in the interest of harmony.[415]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 413: _Order concerning the Rank of Provincial General and\r\nField Officers in North America. Given at our Court at Kensington, 12\r\nMay, 1756._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 414: _Winslow to Shirley, 21 Aug. 1756._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 415: _Correspondence of Loudon, Abercromby, and Shirley, July,\r\nAug. 1756. Record of Meeting of Provincial Officers, July, 1756. Letter\r\nand Order Books of Winslow._]\r\n\r\nLoudon next proceeded to examine the state of the provincial forces, and\r\nsent Lieutenant-Colonel Burton, of the regulars, to observe and report\r\nupon it. Winslow by this time had made a forward movement, and was now\r\nat Lake George with nearly half his command, while the rest were at Fort\r\nEdward under Lyman, or in detachments at Saratoga and the other small\r\nposts below. Burton found Winslow's men encamped with their right on\r\nwhat are now the grounds of Fort William Henry Hotel, and their left\r\nextending southward between the mountain in their front and the marsh in\r\ntheir rear. \"There are here,\" he reports, \"about twenty-five hundred\r\nmen, five hundred of them sick, the greatest part of them what they\r\ncall poorly; they bury from five to eight daily, and officers in\r\nproportion; extremely indolent, and dirty to a degree.\" Then, in\r\nvernacular English, he describes the infectious condition of the fort,\r\nwhich was full of the sick. \"Their camp,\" he proceeds, \"is nastier than\r\nanything I could conceive; their----, kitchens, graves, and places for\r\nslaughtering cattle all mixed through their encampment; a great waste of\r\nprovisions, the men having just what they please; no great command kept\r\nup. Colonel Gridley governs the general; not in the least alert; only\r\none advanced guard of a subaltern and twenty-four men. The cannon and\r\nstores in great confusion.\" Of the camp at Fort Edward he gives a better\r\naccount. \"It is much cleaner than at Fort William Henry, but not\r\nsufficiently so to keep the men healthy; a much better command kept up\r\nhere. General Lyman very ready to order out to work and to assist the\r\nengineers with any number of men they require, and keeps a succession of\r\nscouting-parties out towards Wood Creek and South Bay.\"[416]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 416: _Burton to Loudon, 27 Aug. 1756_.]\r\n\r\nThe prejudice of the regular officer may have colored the picture, but\r\nit is certain that the sanitary condition of the provincial camps was\r\nextremely bad. \"A grievous sickness among the troops,\" writes a\r\nMassachusetts surgeon at Fort Edward; \"we bury five or six a day. Not\r\nmore than two thirds of our army fit for duty. Long encampments are the\r\nbane of New England men.\"[417] Like all raw recruits, they did not know\r\nhow to take care of themselves; and their officers had not the\r\nexperience, knowledge, or habit of command to enforce sanitary rules.\r\nThe same evils were found among the Canadians when kept long in one\r\nplace. Those in the camp of Villiers are reported at this time as nearly\r\nall sick.[418]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 417: _Dr. Thomas Williams to Colonel Israel Williams, 28 Aug.\r\n1756_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 418: Bougainville, _Journal_.]\r\n\r\nAnother penman, very different from the military critic, was also on the\r\nspot, noting down every day what he saw and felt. This was John Graham,\r\nminister of Suffield, in Connecticut, and now chaplain of Lyman's\r\nregiment. His spirit, by nature far from buoyant, was depressed by\r\nbodily ailments, and still more by the extremely secular character of\r\nhis present surroundings. It appears by his Diary that he left home\r\n\"under great exercise of mind,\" and was detained at Albany for a time,\r\nbeing, as he says, taken with an ague-fit and a quinsy; but at length he\r\nreached the camp at Fort Edward, where deep despondency fell upon him.\r\n\"Labor under great discouragements,\" says the Diary, under date of July\r\ntwenty-eighth; \"for find my business but mean in the esteem of many, and\r\nthink there's not much for a chaplain to do.\" Again, Tuesday, August\r\nseventeenth: \"Breakfasted this morning with the General. But a graceless\r\nmeal; never a blessing asked, nor thanks given. At the evening sacrifice\r\na more open scene of wickedness. The General and head officers, with\r\nsome of the regular officers, in General Lyman's tent, within four rods\r\nof the place of public prayers. None came to prayers; but they fixed a\r\ntable without the door of the tent, where a head colonel was posted to\r\nmake punch in the sight of all, they within drinking, talking, and\r\nlaughing during the whole of the service, to the disturbance and\r\ndisaffection of most present. This was not only a bare neglect, but an\r\nopen contempt, of the worship of God by the heads of this army. 'Twas\r\nbut last Sabbath that General Lyman spent the time of divine service in\r\nthe afternoon in his tent, drinking in company with Mr. Gordon, a\r\nregular officer. I have oft heard cursing and swearing in his presence\r\nby some provincial field-officers, but never heard a reproof nor so much\r\nas a check to them come from his mouth, though he never uses such\r\nlanguage himself. Lord, what is man! Truly, the May-game of Fortune!\r\nLord, make me know my duty, and what I ought to do!\"\r\n\r\nThat night his sleep was broken and his soul troubled by angry voices\r\nunder his window, where one Colonel Glasier was berating, in unhallowed\r\nlanguage, the captain of the guard; and here the chaplain's Journal\r\nabruptly ends.[419]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 419: I owe to my friend George S. Hale, Esq., the opportunity\r\nof examining the autograph Journal; it has since been printed in the\r\n_Magazine of American History_ for March, 1882.]\r\n\r\nA brother minister, bearing no likeness to the worthy Graham, appeared\r\non the same spot some time after. This was Chaplain William Crawford, of\r\nWorcester, who, having neglected to bring money to the war, suffered\r\nmuch annoyance, aggravated by what he thought a want of due\r\nconsideration for his person and office. His indignation finds vent in a\r\nletter to his townsman, Timothy Paine, member of the General Court: \"No\r\nman can reasonably expect that I can with any propriety discharge the\r\nduty of a chaplain when I have nothing either to eat or drink, nor any\r\nconveniency to write a line other than to sit down upon a stump and put\r\na piece of paper upon my knee. As for Mr. Weld [_another chaplain_], he\r\nis easy and silent whatever treatment he meets with, and I suppose they\r\nthought to find me the same easy and ductile person; but may the wide\r\nyawning earth devour me first! The state of the camp is just such as one\r\nat home would guess it to be,--nothing but a hurry and confusion of vice\r\nand wickedness, with a stygian atmosphere to breathe in.\"[420] The vice\r\nand wickedness of which he complains appear to have consisted in a\r\nfrequent infraction of the standing order against \"Curseing and\r\nSwareing,\" as well as of that which required attendance on daily\r\nprayers, and enjoined \"the people to appear in a decent manner, clean\r\nand shaved,\" at the two Sunday sermons.[421]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 420: The autograph letter is in Massachusetts Archives, LVI.\r\nno. 142. The same volume contains a letter from Colonel Frye, of\r\nMassachusetts, in which he speaks of the forlorn condition in which\r\nChaplain Weld reached the camp. Of Chaplain Crawford, he says that he\r\ncame decently clothed, but without bed or blanket, till he, Frye, lent\r\nthem to him, and got Captain Learned to take him into his tent.\r\nChaplains usually had a separate tent, or shared that of the colonel.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 421: _Letter and Order Books of Winslow_.]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of August Winslow wrote to the committees of the\r\nseveral provinces: \"It looks as if it won't be long before we are fit\r\nfor a remove,\"--that is, for an advance on Ticonderoga. On the twelfth\r\nLoudon sent Webb with the forty-fourth regiment and some of Bradstreet's\r\nboatmen to reinforce Oswego.[422] They had been ready for a month; but\r\nconfusion and misunderstanding arising from the change of command had\r\nprevented their departure.[423] Yet the utmost anxiety had prevailed for\r\nthe safety of that important post, and on the twenty-eighth Surgeon\r\nThomas Williams wrote: \"Whether Oswego is yet ours is uncertain. Would\r\nhope it is, as the reverse would be such a terrible shock as the country\r\nnever felt, and may be a sad omen of what is coming upon poor sinful New\r\nEngland. Indeed we can't expect anything but to be severely chastened\r\ntill we are humbled for our pride and haughtiness.\"[424]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 422: _Loudon (to Fox?), 19 Aug. 1756_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 423: _Conduct of Major-General Shirley briefly stated. Shirley\r\nto Loudon, 4 Sept. 1756. Shirley to Fox, 16 Sept. 1756_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 424: _Thomas Williams to Colonel Israel Williams, 28 Aug.\r\n1756_.]\r\n\r\nHis foreboding proved true. Webb had scarcely reached the Great Carrying\r\nPlace, when tidings of disaster fell upon him like a thunderbolt. The\r\nFrench had descended in force upon Oswego, taken it with all its\r\ngarrison; and, as report ran, were advancing into the province, six\r\nthousand strong. Wood Creek had just been cleared, with great labor, of\r\nthe trees that choked it. Webb ordered others to be felled and thrown\r\ninto the stream to stop the progress of the enemy; then, with shameful\r\nprecipitation, he burned the forts of the Carrying Place, and retreated\r\ndown the Mohawk to German Flats. Loudon ordered Winslow to think no more\r\nof Ticonderoga, but to stay where he was and hold the French in check.\r\nAll was astonishment and dismay at the sudden blow. \"Oswego has changed\r\nmasters, and I think we may justly fear that the whole of our country\r\nwill soon follow, unless a merciful God prevent, and awake a sinful\r\npeople to repentance and reformation.\" Thus wrote Dr. Thomas Williams to\r\nhis wife from the camp at Fort Edward. \"Such a shocking affair has never\r\nfound a place in English annals,\" wrote the surgeon's young relative,\r\nColonel William Williams. \"The loss is beyond account; but the dishonor\r\ndone His Majesty's arms is infinitely greater.\"[425] It remains to see\r\nhow the catastrophe befell.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 425: _Colonel William Williams to Colonel Israel Williams, 30\r\nAug. 1756_.]\r\n\r\nSince Vaudreuil became chief of the colony he had nursed the plan of\r\nseizing Oswego, yet hesitated to attempt it. Montcalm declares that he\r\nconfirmed the Governor's wavering purpose; but Montcalm himself had\r\nhesitated. In July, however, there came exaggerated reports that the\r\nEnglish were moving upon Ticonderoga in greatly increased numbers; and\r\nboth Vaudreuil and the General conceived that a feint against Oswego\r\nwould draw off the strength of the assailants, and, if promptly and\r\nsecretly executed, might even be turned successfully into a real attack.\r\nVaudreuil thereupon recalled Montcalm from Ticonderoga.[426] Leaving the\r\npost in the keeping of Lévis and three thousand men, he embarked on Lake\r\nChamplain, rowed day and night, and reached Montreal on the nineteenth.\r\nTroops were arriving from Quebec, and Indians from the far west. A band\r\nof Menomonies from beyond Lake Michigan, naked, painted, plumed,\r\ngreased, stamping, uttering sharp yelps, shaking feathered lances,\r\nbrandishing tomahawks, danced the war-dance before the Governor, to the\r\nthumping of the Indian drum. Bougainville looked on astonished, and\r\nthought of the Pyrrhic dance of the Greeks.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 426: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 12 Août, 1756. Montcalm à sa\r\nFemme, 20 Juillet, 1756_.]\r\n\r\nMontcalm and he left Montreal on the twenty-first, and reached Fort\r\nFrontenac in eight days. Rigaud, brother of the Governor, had gone\r\nthither some time before, and crossed with seven hundred Canadians to\r\nthe south side of the lake, where Villiers was encamped at Niaouré Bay,\r\nnow Sackett's Harbor, with such of his detachment as war and disease had\r\nspared. Rigaud relieved him, and took command of the united bands. With\r\ntheir aid the engineer, Descombles, reconnoitred the English forts, and\r\ncame back with the report that success was certain.[427] It was but a\r\nconfirmation of what had already been learned from deserters and\r\nprisoners, who declared that the main fort was but a loopholed wall held\r\nby six or seven hundred men, ill fed, discontented, and mutinous.[428]\r\nOthers said that they had been driven to desert by the want of good\r\nfood, and that within a year twelve hundred men had died of disease at\r\nOswego.[429]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 427: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 4 Août, 1756. Vaudreuil à\r\nBourlamaque, Juin, 1756_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 428: Bougainville, _Journal_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 429: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 10 Juillet, 1756. Résumé des\r\nNouvelles du Canada, Sept. 1756_.]\r\n\r\nThe battalions of La Sarre, Guienne, and Béarn, with the colony\r\nregulars, a body of Canadians, and about two hundred and fifty Indians,\r\nwere destined for the enterprise. The whole force was a little above\r\nthree thousand, abundantly supplied with artillery. La Sarre and Guienne\r\nwere already at Fort Frontenac. Béarn was at Niagara, whence it arrived\r\nin a few days, much buffeted by the storms of Lake Ontario. On the\r\nfourth of August all was ready. Montcalm embarked at night with the\r\nfirst division, crossed in darkness to Wolf Island, lay there hidden all\r\nday, and embarking again in the evening, joined Rigaud at Niaouré Bay at\r\nseven o'clock in the morning of the sixth. The second division followed,\r\nwith provisions, hospital train, and eighty artillery boats; and on the\r\neighth all were united at the bay. On the ninth Rigaud, covered by the\r\nuniversal forest, marched in advance to protect the landing of the\r\ntroops. Montcalm followed with the first division; and, coasting the\r\nshore in bateaux, landed at midnight of the tenth within half a league\r\nof the first English fort. Four cannon were planted in battery upon the\r\nstrand, and the men bivouacked by their boats. So skilful were the\r\nassailants and so careless the assailed that the English knew nothing of\r\ntheir danger, till in the morning, a reconnoitring canoe discovered the\r\ninvaders. Two armed vessels soon came to cannonade them; but their light\r\nguns were no match for the heavy artillery of the French, and they were\r\nforced to keep the offing.\r\n\r\nDescombles, the engineer, went before dawn to reconnoitre the fort, with\r\nseveral other officers and a party of Indians. While he was thus\r\nemployed, one of these savages, hungry for scalps, took him in the gloom\r\nfor an Englishman, and shot him dead. Captain Pouchot, of the battalion\r\nof Béarn, replaced him; and the attack was pushed vigorously. The\r\nCanadians and Indians, swarming through the forest, fired all day on the\r\nfort under cover of the trees. The second division came up with\r\ntwenty-two more cannon; and at night the first parallel was marked out\r\nat a hundred and eighty yards from the rampart. Stumps were grubbed up,\r\nfallen trunks shoved aside, and a trench dug, sheltered by fascines,\r\ngabions, and a strong abattis.\r\n\r\nFort Ontario, counted as the best of the three forts at Oswego, stood on\r\na high plateau at the east or right side of the river where it entered\r\nthe lake. It was in the shape of a star, and was formed of trunks of\r\ntrees set upright in the ground, hewn flat on two sides, and closely\r\nfitted together,--an excellent defence against musketry or swivels, but\r\nworthless against cannon. The garrison, three hundred and seventy in\r\nall, were the remnant of Pepperell's regiment, joined to raw recruits\r\nlately sent up to fill the places of the sick and dead. They had eight\r\nsmall cannon and a mortar, with which on the next day, Friday, the\r\nthirteenth, they kept up a brisk fire till towards night; when, after\r\ngrowing more rapid for a time, it ceased, and the fort showed no sign of\r\nlife. Not a cannon had yet opened on them from the trenches; but it was\r\ncertain that with the French artillery once in action, their wooden\r\nrampart would be shivered to splinters. Hence it was that Colonel\r\nMercer, commandant at Oswego, thinking it better to lose the fort than\r\nto lose both fort and garrison, signalled to them from across the river\r\nto abandon their position and join him on the other side. Boats were\r\nsent to bring them off; and they passed over unmolested, after spiking\r\ntheir cannon and firing off their ammunition or throwing it into the\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nThe fate of Oswego was now sealed. The principal work, called Old\r\nOswego, or Fort Pepperell, stood at the mouth of the river on the west\r\nside, nearly opposite Fort Ontario, and less than five hundred yards\r\ndistant from it. The trading-house, which formed the centre of the\r\nplace, was built of rough stone laid in clay, and the wall which\r\nenclosed it was of the same materials; both would crumble in an instant\r\nat the touch of a twelve-pound shot. Towards the west and south they had\r\nbeen protected by an outer line of earthworks, mounted with cannon, and\r\nforming an entrenched camp; while the side towards Fort Ontario was left\r\nwholly exposed, in the rash confidence that this work, standing on the\r\nopposite heights, would guard against attack from that quarter. On a\r\nhill, a fourth of a mile beyond Old Oswego, stood the unfinished\r\nstockade called New Oswego, Fort George, or, by reason of its\r\nworthlessness, Fort Rascal. It had served as a cattle pen before the\r\nFrench appeared, but was now occupied by a hundred and fifty Jersey\r\nprovincials. Old Oswego with its outwork was held by Shirley's regiment,\r\nchiefly invalids and raw recruits, to whom were now joined the garrison\r\nof Fort Ontario and a number of sailors, boatmen, and laborers.\r\n\r\nMontcalm lost no time. As soon as darkness set in he began a battery at\r\nthe brink of the height on which stood the captured fort. His whole\r\nforce toiled all night, digging, setting gabions, and dragging up\r\ncannon, some of which had been taken from Braddock. Before daybreak\r\ntwenty heavy pieces had been brought to the spot, and nine were already\r\nin position. The work had been so rapid that the English imagined their\r\nenemies to number six thousand at least. The battery soon opened fire.\r\nGrape and round shot swept the intrenchment and crashed through the\r\nrotten masonry. The English, says a French officer, \"were exposed to\r\ntheir shoe-buckles.\" Their artillery was pointed the wrong way, in\r\nexpectation of an attack, not from the east, but from the west. They now\r\nmade a shelter of pork-barrels, three high and three deep, planted\r\ncannon behind them, and returned the French fire with some effect.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning Montcalm had ordered Rigaud to cross the river with\r\nthe Canadians and Indians. There was a ford three quarters of a league\r\nabove the forts;[430] and here they passed over unopposed, the English\r\nnot having discovered the movement.[431] The only danger was from the\r\nriver. Some of the men were forced to swim, others waded to the waist,\r\nothers to the neck; but they all crossed safely, and presently showed\r\nthemselves at the edge of the woods, yelling and firing their guns, too\r\nfar for much execution, but not too far to discourage the garrison.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 430: Bougainville, _Journal_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 431: Pouchot, I. 76.]\r\n\r\nThe garrison were already disheartened. Colonel Mercer, the soul of the\r\ndefence, had just been cut in two by a cannon-shot while directing the\r\ngunners. Up to this time the defenders had behaved with spirit; but\r\ndespair now seized them, increased by the screams and entreaties of the\r\nwomen, of whom there were more than a hundred in the place. There was a\r\ncouncil of officers, and then the white flag was raised. Bougainville\r\nwent to propose terms of capitulation. \"The cries, threats, and hideous\r\nhowling of our Canadians and Indians,\" says Vaudreuil, \"made them\r\nquickly decide.\" \"This,\" observes the Reverend Father Claude Godefroy\r\nCocquard, \"reminds me of the fall of Jericho before the shouts of the\r\nIsraelites.\" The English surrendered prisoners of war, to the number,\r\naccording to the Governor, of sixteen hundred,[432] which included the\r\nsailors, laborers, and women. The Canadians and Indians broke through\r\nall restraint, and fell to plundering. There was an opening of\r\nrum-barrels and a scene of drunkenness, in which some of the prisoners\r\nhad their share; while others tried to escape in the confusion, and were\r\ntomahawked by the excited savages. Many more would have been butchered,\r\nbut for the efforts of Montcalm, who by unstinted promises succeeded in\r\nappeasing his ferocious allies, whom he dared not offend. \"It will cost\r\nthe King,\" he says, \"eight or ten thousand livres in presents.\"[433]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 432: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 20 Août, 1756_. He elsewhere\r\nmakes the number somewhat greater. That the garrison, exclusive of\r\ncivilians, did not exceed at the utmost fourteen hundred, is shown by\r\n_Shirley to Loudon, 5 Sept. 1756_. Loudon had charged Shirley with\r\nleaving Oswego weakly garrisoned; and Shirley replies by alleging that\r\nthe troops there were in the number as above. It was of course his\r\ninterest to make them appear as numerous as possible. In the printed\r\n_Conduct of Major-General Shirley briefly stated_, they are put at only\r\nten hundred and fifty.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 433: Several English writers say, however, that fifteen or\r\ntwenty young men were given up to the Indians to be adopted in place of\r\nwarriors lately killed.]\r\n\r\nThe loss on both sides is variously given. By the most trustworthy\r\naccounts, that of the English did not reach fifty killed, and that of\r\nthe French was still less. In the forts and vessels were found above a\r\nhundred pieces of artillery, most of them swivels and other light guns,\r\nwith a large quantity of powder, shot, and shell. The victors burned the\r\nforts and the vessels on the stocks, destroyed such provisions and\r\nstores as they could not carry away, and made the place a desert. The\r\npriest Piquet, who had joined the expedition, planted amid the ruin a\r\ntall cross, graven with the words, _In hoc signo vincunt_; and near it\r\nwas set a pole bearing the arms of France, with the inscription,\r\n_Manibus date lilia plenis_. Then the army decamped, loaded with\r\nprisoners and spoil, descended to Montreal, hung the captured flags in\r\nthe churches, and sang Te Deum in honor of their triumph.\r\n\r\nIt was the greatest that the French arms had yet achieved in America.\r\nThe defeat of Braddock was an Indian victory; this last exploit was the\r\nresult of bold enterprise and skilful tactics. With its laurels came its\r\nfruits. Hated Oswego had been laid in ashes, and the would-be assailants\r\nforced to a vain and hopeless defence. France had conquered the\r\nundisputed command of Lake Ontario, and her communications with the West\r\nwere safe. A small garrison at Niagara and another at Frontenac would\r\nnow hold those posts against any effort that the English could make this\r\nyear; and the whole French force could concentrate at Ticonderoga, repel\r\nthe threatened attack, and perhaps retort it by seizing Albany. If the\r\nEnglish, on the other side, had lost a great material advantage, they\r\nhad lost no less in honor. The news of the surrender was received with\r\nindignation in England and in the colonies. Yet the behaviour of the\r\ngarrison was not so discreditable as it seemed. The position was\r\nindefensible, and they could have held out at best but a few days more.\r\nThey yielded too soon; but unless Webb had come to their aid, which was\r\nnot to be expected, they must have yielded at last.\r\n\r\nThe French had scarcely gone, when two English scouts, Thomas Harris and\r\nJames Conner, came with a party of Indians to the scene of desolation.\r\nThe ground was strewn with broken casks and bread sodden with rain. The\r\nremains of burnt bateaux and whaleboats were scattered along the shore.\r\nThe great stone trading-house in the old fort was a smoking ruin; Fort\r\nRascal was still burning on the neighboring hill; Fort Ontario was a\r\nmass of ashes and charred logs, and by it stood two poles on which were\r\nwritten words which the visitors did not understand. They went back to\r\nFort Johnson with their story; and Oswego reverted for a time to the\r\nbears, foxes, and wolves.[434]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 434: On the capture of Oswego, the authorities examined have\r\nbeen very numerous, and only the best need be named. _Livre d'Ordres,\r\nCampagne de 1756_, contains all orders from headquarters. _Mémoires pour\r\nservir d'Instruction à M. le Marquis de Montcalm, 21 Juillet; 1756,\r\nsigné Vaudreuil_.

There was an element of boyishness in him. He made bold plans\r\nwithout weighing too closely his means of executing them. The year's\r\ncampaign would in all likelihood have succeeded if he could have acted\r\npromptly; if he had had ready to his hand a well-trained and\r\nwell-officered force, furnished with material of war and means of\r\ntransportation, and prepared to move as soon as the streams and lakes of\r\nNew York were open, while those of Canada were still sealed with ice.\r\nBut timely action was out of his power. The army that should have moved\r\nin April was not ready to move till August. Of the nine discordant\r\nsemi-republics whom he asked to join in the work, three or four refused,\r\nsome of the others were lukewarm, and all were slow. Even Massachusetts,\r\nusually the foremost, failed to get all her men into the field till the\r\nseason was nearly ended. Having no military establishment, the colonies\r\nwere forced to improvise a new army for every campaign. Each of them\r\nwatched its neighbors, or, jealous lest it should do more than its just\r\nshare, waited for them to begin. Each popular assembly acted under the\r\neye of a frugal constituency, who, having little money, were as chary of\r\nit as their descendants are lavish; and most of them were shaken by\r\ninternal conflicts, more absorbing than the great question on which hung\r\nthe fate of the continent. Only the four New England colonies were fully\r\nearnest for the war, and one, even of these, was ready to use the crisis\r\nas a means of extorting concessions from its Governor in return for\r\ngrants of money and men. When the lagging contingents came together at\r\nlast, under a commander whom none of them trusted, they were met by\r\nstrategical difficulties which would have perplexed older soldiers and\r\nan abler general; for they were forced to act on the circumference of a\r\nvast semicircle, in a labyrinth of forests, without roads, and choked\r\nwith every kind of obstruction.\r\n\r\nOpposed to them was a trained army, well organized and commanded,\r\nfocused at Montreal, and moving for attack or defence on two radiating\r\nlines,--one towards Lake Ontario, and the other towards Lake\r\nChamplain,--supported by a martial peasantry, supplied from France with\r\nmoney and material, dependent on no popular vote, having no will but\r\nthat of its chief, and ready on the instant to strike to right or left\r\nas the need required. It was a compact military absolutism confronting a\r\nheterogeneous group of industrial democracies, where the force of\r\nnumbers was neutralized by diffusion and incoherence. A long and dismal\r\napprenticeship waited them before they could hope for success; nor could\r\nthey ever put forth their full strength without a radical change of\r\npolitical conditions and an awakened consciousness of common interests\r\nand a common cause. It was the sense of powerlessness arising from the\r\nwant of union that, after the fall of Oswego, spread alarm through the\r\nnorthern and middle colonies, and drew these desponding words from\r\nWilliam Livingston, of New Jersey: \"The colonies are nearly exhausted,\r\nand their funds already anticipated by expensive unexecuted projects.\r\nJealous are they of each other; some ill-constituted, others shaken with\r\nintestine divisions, and, if I may be allowed the expression,\r\nparsimonious even to prodigality. Our assemblies are diffident of their\r\ngovernors, governors despise their assemblies; and both mutually\r\nmisrepresent each other to the Court of Great Britain.\" Military\r\nmeasures, he proceeds, demand secrecy and despatch; but when so many\r\ndivided provinces must agree to join in them, secrecy and despatch are\r\nimpossible. In conclusion he exclaims: \"Canada must be demolished,\r\n--_Delenda est Carthago_,--or we are undone.\"[435] But Loudon\r\nwas not Scipio, and cis-Atlantic Carthage was to stand for some time\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 435: _Review of Military Operations_, 187, 189 (Dublin,\r\n1757).]\r\n\r\nThe Earl, in search of a scapegoat for the loss of Oswego, naturally\r\nchose Shirley, attacked him savagely, told him that he was of no use in\r\nAmerica, and ordered him to go home to England without delay.[436]\r\nShirley, who was then in Boston, answered this indecency with dignity\r\nand effect.[437] The chief fault was with Loudon himself, whose late\r\narrival in America had caused a change of command and of plans in the\r\ncrisis of the campaign. Shirley well knew the weakness of Oswego; and in\r\nearly spring had sent two engineers to make it defensible, with\r\nparticular instructions to strengthen Fort Ontario.[438] But they,\r\nthinking that the chief danger lay on the west and south, turned all\r\ntheir attention thither, and neglected Ontario till it was too late.\r\nShirley was about to reinforce Oswego with a strong body of troops when\r\nthe arrival of Abercromby took the control out of his hands and caused\r\nruinous delay. He cannot, however, be acquitted of mismanagement in\r\nfailing to supply the place with wholesome provisions in the preceding\r\nautumn, before the streams were stopped with ice. Hence came the ravages\r\nof disease and famine which, before spring, reduced the garrison to a\r\nhundred and forty effective men. Yet there can be no doubt that the\r\nchange of command was a blunder. This is the view of Franklin, who knew\r\nShirley well, and thus speaks of him: \"He would in my opinion, if\r\ncontinued in place, have made a much better campaign than that of\r\nLoudon, which was frivolous, expensive, and disgraceful to our nation\r\nbeyond conception. For though Shirley was not bred a soldier, he was\r\nsensible and sagacious in himself, and attentive to good advice from\r\nothers, capable of forming judicious plans, and quick and active in\r\ncarrying them into execution.\"[439] He sailed for England in the autumn,\r\ndisappointed and poor; the bull-headed Duke of Cumberland had been\r\ndeeply prejudiced against him, and it was only after long waiting that\r\nthis strenuous champion of British interests was rewarded in his old age\r\nwith the petty government of the Bahamas.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 436: _Loudon to Shirley, 6 Sept. 1756_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 437: The correspondence on both sides is before me, copied\r\nfrom the originals in the Public Record Office.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 438: \"The principal thing for which I sent Mr. Mackellar to\r\nOswego was to strengthen Fort Ontario as much as he possibly could.\"\r\n_Shirley to Loudon, 4 Sept. 1756._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 439: _Works of Franklin_, I. 220.]\r\n\r\nLoudon had now about ten thousand men at his command, though not all fit\r\nfor duty. They were posted from Albany to Lake George. The Earl himself\r\nwas at Fort Edward, while about three thousand of the provincials still\r\nlay, under Winslow, at the lake. Montcalm faced them at Ticonderoga,\r\nwith five thousand three hundred regulars and Canadians, in a position\r\nwhere they could defy three times their number.[440] \"The sons of Belial\r\nare too strong for me,\" jocosely wrote Winslow;[441] and he set himself\r\nto intrenching his camp; then had the forest cut down for the space of a\r\nmile from the lake to the mountains, so that the trees, lying in what he\r\ncalls a \"promiscuous manner,\" formed an almost impenetrable abatis. An\r\nescaped prisoner told him that the French were coming to visit him with\r\nfourteen thousand men;[442] but Montcalm thought no more of stirring\r\nthan Loudon himself; and each stood watching the other, with the lake\r\nbetween them, till the season closed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 440: \"Nous sommes tant à Carillon qu'aux postes avancés 5,300\r\nhommes.\" Bougainville, _Journal_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 441: _Winslow to Loudon, 29 Sept. 1756_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 442: _Examination of Sergeant James Archibald_.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the western borders were still ravaged by the tomahawk. New\r\nYork, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia all writhed under\r\nthe infliction. Each had made a chain of blockhouses and wooden forts to\r\ncover its frontier, and manned them with disorderly bands, lawless, and\r\nalmost beyond control.[443] The case was at the worst in Pennsylvania,\r\nwhere the tedious quarrelling of Governor and Assembly, joined to the\r\ndoggedly pacific attitude of the Quakers, made vigorous defence\r\nimpossible. Rewards were offered for prisoners and scalps, so bountiful\r\nthat the hunting of men would have been a profitable vocation, but for\r\nthe extreme wariness and agility of the game.[444] Some of the forts\r\nwere well built stockades; others were almost worthless; but the enemy\r\nrarely molested even the feeblest of them, preferring to ravage the\r\nlonely and unprotected farms. There were two or three exceptions. A\r\nVirginian fort was attacked by a war-party under an officer named\r\nDouville, who was killed, and his followers were put to flight.[445] The\r\nassailants were more fortunate at a small stockade called Fort\r\nGranville, on the Juniata. A large body of French and Indians attacked\r\nit in August while most of the garrison were absent protecting the\r\nfarmers at their harvest; they set it on fire, and, in spite of a most\r\ngallant resistance by the young lieutenant left in command, took it, and\r\nkilled all but one of the defenders.[446]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 443: In the public Record Office, _America and West Indies_,\r\nLXXXII., is a manuscript map showing the positions of such of these\r\nposts as were north of Virginia. They are thirty-five in number, from\r\nthe head of James River to a point west of Esopus, on the Hudson.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 444: _Colonial Records of Pa._, VII. 76.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 445: _Washington to Morris,--April, 1756_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 446: _Colonial Records of Pa._, VII. 232, 242; _Pennsylvania\r\nArchives_, II. 744.]\r\n\r\nWhat sort of resistance the Pennsylvanian borderers would have made\r\nunder political circumstances less adverse may be inferred from an\r\nexploit of Colonel John Armstrong, a settler of Cumberland. After the\r\nloss of Fort Granville the Governor of the province sent him with three\r\nhundred men to attack the Delaware town of Kittanning, a populous nest\r\nof savages on the Alleghany, between the two French posts of Duquesne\r\nand Venango. Here most of the war-parties were fitted out, and the place\r\nwas full of stores and munitions furnished by the French. Here, too,\r\nlived the redoubted chief called Captain Jacobs, the terror of the\r\nEnglish border. Armstrong set out from Fort Shirley, the farthest\r\noutpost, on the last of August, and, a week after, was within six miles\r\nof the Indian town. By rapid marching and rare good luck, his party had\r\nescaped discovery. It was ten o'clock at night, with a bright moon. The\r\nguides were perplexed, and knew neither the exact position of the place\r\nnor the paths that led to it. The adventurers threaded the forest in\r\nsingle file, over hills and through hollows, bewildered and anxious,\r\nstopping to watch and listen. At length they heard in the distance the\r\nbeating of an Indian drum and the whooping of warriors in the war-dance.\r\nGuided by the sounds, they cautiously moved forward, till those in the\r\nfront, scrambling down a rocky hill, found themselves on the banks of\r\nthe Alleghany, about a hundred rods below Kittanning. The moon was near\r\nsetting; but they could dimly see the town beyond a great intervening\r\nfield of corn. \"At that moment,\" says Armstrong, \"an Indian whistled in\r\na very singular manner, about thirty perches from our front, in the foot\r\nof the cornfield.\" He thought they were discovered; but one Baker, a\r\nsoldier well versed in Indian ways, told him that it was only some\r\nvillage gallant calling to a young squaw. The party then crouched in the\r\nbushes, and kept silent. The moon sank behind the woods, and fires soon\r\nglimmered through the field, kindled to drive off mosquitoes by some of\r\nthe Indians who, as the night was warm, had come out to sleep in the\r\nopen air. The eastern sky began to redden with the approach of day. Many\r\nof the party, spent with a rough march of thirty miles, had fallen\r\nasleep. They were now cautiously roused; and Armstrong ordered nearly\r\nhalf of them to make their way along the ridge of a bushy hill that\r\noverlooked the town, till they came opposite to it, in order to place it\r\nbetween two fires. Twenty minutes were allowed them for the movement;\r\nbut they lost their way in the dusk, and reached their station too late.\r\nWhen the time had expired, Armstrong gave the signal to those left with\r\nhim, who dashed into the cornfield, shooting down the astonished savages\r\nor driving them into the village, where they turned and made desperate\r\nfight.\r\n\r\nIt was a cluster of thirty log-cabins, the principal being that of the\r\nchief, Jacobs, which was loopholed for musketry, and became the centre\r\nof resistance. The fight was hot and stubborn. Armstrong ordered the\r\ntown to be set on fire, which was done, though not without loss; for the\r\nDelawares at this time were commonly armed with rifles, and used them\r\nwell. Armstrong himself was hit in the shoulder. As the flames rose and\r\nthe smoke grew thick, a warrior in one of the houses sang his\r\ndeath-song, and a squaw in the same house was heard to cry and scream.\r\nRough voices silenced her, and then the inmates burst out, but were\r\ninstantly killed. The fire caught the house of Jacobs, who, trying to\r\nescape through an opening in the roof, was shot dead. Bands of Indians\r\nwere gathering beyond the river, firing from the other bank, and even\r\ncrossing to help their comrades; but the assailants held to their work\r\ntill the whole place was destroyed. \"During the burning of the houses,\"\r\nsays Armstrong, \"we were agreeably entertained by the quick succession\r\nof charged guns, gradually firing off as reached by the fire; but much\r\nmore so with the vast explosion of sundry bags and large kegs of\r\ngunpowder, wherewith almost every house abounded; the prisoners\r\nafterwards informing us that the Indians had frequently said they had a\r\nsufficient stock of ammunition for ten years' war with the English.\"\r\n\r\nThese prisoners were eleven men, women, and children, captured in the\r\nborder settlements, and now delivered by their countrymen. The day was\r\nfar spent when the party withdrew, carrying their wounded on Indian\r\nhorses, and moving perforce with extreme slowness, though expecting an\r\nattack every moment. None took place; and they reached the settlements\r\nat last, having bought their success with the loss of seventeen killed\r\nand thirteen wounded.[447] A medal was given to each officer, not by the\r\nQuaker-ridden Assembly, but by the city council of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 447: _Report of Armstrong to Governor Denny, 14 Sept. 1756_,\r\nin _Colonial Records of Pa._, VII. 257,--a modest yet very minute\r\naccount. _A list of the Names of the Persons killed, wounded, and\r\nmissing in the late Expedition against the Kittanning_. Hazard,\r\n_Pennsylvania Register_, I. 366.]\r\n\r\nThe report of this affair made by Dumas, commandant at Fort Duquesne, is\r\nworth noting. He says that Attiqué, the French name of Kittanning, was\r\nattacked by \"le Général Wachinton,\" with three or four hundred men on\r\nhorseback; that the Indians gave way; but that five or six Frenchmen who\r\nwere in the town held the English in check till the fugitives rallied;\r\nthat Washington and his men then took to flight, and would have been\r\npursued but for the loss of some barrels of gunpowder which chanced to\r\nexplode during the action. Dumas adds that several large parties are now\r\non the track of the enemy, and he hopes will cut them to pieces. He then\r\nasks for a supply of provisions and merchandise to replace those which\r\nthe Indians of Attiqué had lost by a fire.[448] Like other officers of\r\nthe day, he would admit nothing but successes in the department under\r\nhis command.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 448: _Dumas à Vaudreuil, 9 Sept. 1756_, cited in _Bigot au\r\nMinistre, 6 Oct. 1756_, and in Bougainville, _Journal_.]\r\n\r\nVaudreuil wrote singular despatches at this time to the minister at\r\nVersailles. He takes credit to himself for the number of war-parties\r\nthat his officers kept always at work, and fills page after page with\r\ndetails of the _coups_ they had struck; how one brought in two English\r\nscalps, another three, another one, and another seven. He owns that they\r\ncommitted frightful cruelties, mutilating and sometimes burning their\r\nprisoners; but he expresses no regret, and probably felt none, since he\r\ndeclares that the object of this murderous warfare was to punish the\r\nEnglish till they longed for peace.[449]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 449: _Dépêches de Vaudreuil, 1756._]\r\n\r\nThe waters and mountains of Lake George, and not the western borders,\r\nwere the chief centre of partisan war. Ticonderoga was a hornet's nest,\r\npouring out swarms of savages to infest the highways and byways of the\r\nwilderness. The English at Fort William Henry, having few Indians, could\r\nnot retort in kind; but they kept their scouts and rangers in active\r\nmovement. What they most coveted was prisoners, as sources of\r\ninformation. One Kennedy, a lieutenant of provincials, with five\r\nfollowers, white and red, made a march of rare audacity, passed all the\r\nFrench posts, took a scalp and two prisoners on the Richelieu, and\r\nburned a magazine of provisions between Montreal and St. John. The party\r\nwere near famishing on the way back; and Kennedy was brought into Fort\r\nWilliam Henry in a state of temporary insanity from starvation.[450]\r\nOther provincial officers, Peabody, Hazen, Waterbury, and Miller, won a\r\ncertain distinction in this adventurous service, though few were so\r\nconspicuous as the blunt and sturdy Israel Putnam. Winslow writes in\r\nOctober that he has just returned from the best \"scout\" yet made, and\r\nthat, being a man of strict truth, he may be entirely trusted.[451]\r\nPutnam had gone with six followers down Lake George in a whale-boat to a\r\npoint on the east side, opposite the present village of Hague, hid the\r\nboat, crossed northeasterly to Lake Champlain, three miles from the\r\nFrench fort, climbed the mountain that overlooks it, and made a complete\r\nreconnoissance; then approached it, chased three Frenchmen, who escaped\r\nwithin the lines, climbed the mountain again, and moving westward along\r\nthe ridge, made a minute survey of every outpost between the fort and\r\nLake George.[452] These adventures were not always fortunate. On the\r\nnineteenth of September Captain Hodges and fifty men were ambushed a few\r\nmiles from Fort William Henry by thrice their number of Canadians and\r\nIndians, and only six escaped. Thus the record stands in the _Letter\r\nBook_ of Winslow.[453] By visiting the encampments of Ticonderoga, one\r\nmay learn how the blow was struck.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 450: _Minute of Lieutenant Kennedy's Scout. Winslow to Loudon,\r\n20 Sept. 1756._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 451: _Winslow to Loudon, 16 Oct. 1756._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 452: _Report of a Scout to Ticonderoga, Oct. 1756_, signed\r\nIsrael Putnam.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 453: Compare Massachusetts Archives, LXXVI. 81.]\r\n\r\nAfter much persuasion, much feasting, and much consumption of tobacco\r\nand brandy, four hundred Indians, Christians from the Missions and\r\nheathen from the far west, were persuaded to go on a grand war-party\r\nwith the Canadians. Of these last there were a hundred,--a wild crew,\r\nbedecked and bedaubed like their Indian companions. Perière, an officer\r\nof colony regulars, had nominal command of the whole; and among the\r\nleaders of the Canadians was the famous bushfighter, Marin. Bougainville\r\nwas also of the party. In the evening of the sixteenth they all embarked\r\nin canoes at the French advance-post commanded by Contrecoeur, near the\r\npresent steamboat-landing, passed in the gloom under the bare steeps of\r\nRogers Rock, paddled a few hours, landed on the west shore, and sent\r\nscouts to reconnoitre. These came back with their reports on the next\r\nday, and an Indian crier called the chiefs to council. Bougainville\r\ndescribes them as they stalked gravely to the place of meeting, wrapped\r\nin colored blankets, with lances in their hands. The accomplished young\r\naide-de-camp studied his strange companions with an interest not unmixed\r\nwith disgust. \"Of all caprice,\" he says, \"Indian caprice is the most\r\ncapricious.\" They were insolent to the French, made rules for them which\r\nthey did not observe themselves, and compelled the whole party to move\r\nwhen and whither they pleased. Hiding the canoes, and lying close in the\r\nforest by day, they all held their nocturnal course southward, by the\r\nlofty heights of Black Mountain, and among the islets of the Narrows,\r\ntill the eighteenth. That night the Indian scouts reported that they had\r\nseen the fires of an encampment on the west shore; on which the whole\r\nparty advanced to the attack, an hour before dawn, filing silently under\r\nthe dark arches of the forest, the Indians nearly naked, and streaked\r\nwith their war-paint of vermilion and soot. When they reached the spot\r\nthey found only the smouldering fires of a deserted bivouac. Then there\r\nwas a consultation; ending, after much dispute, with the choice by the\r\nIndians of a hundred and ten of their most active warriors to attempt\r\nsome stroke in the neighborhood of the English fort. Marin joined them\r\nwith thirty Canadians, and they set out on their errand; while the rest\r\nencamped to await the result. At night the adventurers returned, raising\r\nthe death-cry and firing their guns; somewhat depressed by losses they\r\nhad suffered, but boasting that they had surprised fifty-three English,\r\nand killed or taken all but one. It was a modest and perhaps an\r\ninvoluntary exaggeration. \"The very recital of the cruelties they\r\ncommitted on the battle-field is horrible,\" writes Bougainville. \"The\r\nferocity and insolence of these black-souled barbarians makes one\r\nshudder. It is an abominable kind of war. The air one breathes is\r\ncontagious of insensibility and hardness.\"[454] This was but one of the\r\nmany such parties sent out from Ticonderoga this year.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 454: Bougainville, _Journal_.]\r\n\r\nEarly in September a band of New England rangers came to Winslow's camp,\r\nwith three prisoners taken within the lines of Ticonderoga. Their\r\ncaptain was Robert Rogers, of New Hampshire,--a strong, well-knit\r\nfigure, in dress and appearance more woodsman than soldier, with a\r\nclear, bold eye, and features that would have been good but for the\r\nungainly proportions of the nose.[455] He had passed his boyhood in the\r\nrough surroundings of a frontier village. Growing to manhood, he engaged\r\nin some occupation which, he says, led him to frequent journeyings in\r\nthe wilderness between the French and English settlements, and gave him\r\na good knowledge of both.[456] It taught him also to speak a little\r\nFrench. He does not disclose the nature of this mysterious employment;\r\nbut there can be little doubt that it was a smuggling trade with Canada.\r\nHis character leaves much to be desired. He had been charged with\r\nforgery, or complicity in it, seems to have had no scruple in matters of\r\nbusiness, and after the war was accused of treasonable dealings with the\r\nFrench and Spaniards in the west.[457] He was ambitious and violent, yet\r\nable in more ways than one, by no means uneducated, and so skilled in\r\nwoodcraft, so energetic and resolute, that his services were invaluable.\r\nIn recounting his own adventures, his style is direct, simple, without\r\nboasting, and to all appearance without exaggeration. During the past\r\nsummer he had raised a band of men, chiefly New Hampshire borderers, and\r\nmade a series of daring excursions which gave him a prominent place in\r\nthis hardy by-play of war. In the spring of the present year he raised\r\nanother company, and was commissioned as its captain, with his brother\r\nRichard as his first lieutenant, and the intrepid John Stark as his\r\nsecond. In July still another company was formed, and Richard Rogers was\r\npromoted to command it. Before the following spring there were seven\r\nsuch; and more were afterwards added, forming a battalion dispersed on\r\nvarious service, but all under the orders of Robert Rogers, with the\r\nrank of major.[458] These rangers wore a sort of woodland uniform, which\r\nvaried in the different companies, and were armed with smooth-bore guns,\r\nloaded with buckshot, bullets, or sometimes both.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 455: A large engraved portrait of him, nearly at full length,\r\nis before me, printed at London in 1776.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 456: Rogers, _Journals, Introduction_ (1765).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 457: _Provincial Papers of New Hampshire_, VI. 364.\r\n_Correspondence of Gage, 1766. N.Y. Col. Docs._, VII. 990. Caleb Stark,\r\n_Memoir and Correspondence of John Stark_, 386.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 458: Rogers, _Journals. Report of the Adjutant-General of New\r\nHampshire_ (1866), II. 158, 159.]\r\n\r\nThe best of them were commonly employed on Lake George; and nothing can\r\nsurpass the adventurous hardihood of their lives. Summer and winter, day\r\nand night, were alike to them. Embarked in whaleboats or birch-canoes,\r\nthey glided under the silent moon or in the languid glare of a\r\nbreathless August day, when islands floated in dreamy haze, and the hot\r\nair was thick with odors of the pine; or in the bright October, when the\r\njay screamed from the woods, squirrels gathered their winter hoard, and\r\ncongregated blackbirds chattered farewell to their summer haunts; when\r\ngay mountains basked in light, maples dropped leaves of rustling gold,\r\nsumachs glowed like rubies under the dark green of the unchanging\r\nspruce, and mossed rocks with all their painted plumage lay double in\r\nthe watery mirror: that festal evening of the year, when jocund Nature\r\ndisrobes herself, to wake again refreshed in the joy of her undying\r\nspring. Or, in the tomb-like silence of the winter forest, with breath\r\nfrozen on his beard, the ranger strode on snow-shoes over the spotless\r\ndrifts; and, like Dürer's knight, a ghastly death stalked ever at his\r\nside. There were those among them for whom this stern life had a\r\nfascination that made all other existence tame.\r\n\r\nRogers and his men had been in active movement since midwinter. In\r\nJanuary they skated down Lake George, passed Ticonderoga, hid themselves\r\nby the forest-road between that post and Crown Point, intercepted two\r\nsledges loaded with provisions, and carried the drivers to Fort William\r\nHenry. In February they climbed a hill near Crown Point and made a plan\r\nof the works; then lay in ambush by the road from the fort to the\r\nneighboring village, captured a prisoner, burned houses and barns,\r\nkilled fifty cattle, and returned without loss. At the end of the month\r\nthey went again to Crown Point, burned more houses and barns, and\r\nreconnoitred Ticonderoga on the way back. Such excursions were repeated\r\nthroughout the spring and summer. The reconnoissance of Ticonderoga and\r\nthe catching of prisoners there for the sake of information were always\r\ncapital objects. The valley, four miles in extent, that lay between the\r\nfoot of Lake George and the French fort, was at this time guarded by\r\nfour distinct outposts or fortified camps. Watched as it was at all\r\npoints, and ranged incessantly by Indians in the employ of France,\r\nRogers and his men knew every yard of the ground. On a morning in May he\r\nlay in ambush with eleven followers on a path between the fort and the\r\nnearest camp. A large body of soldiers passed; the rangers counted a\r\nhundred and eighteen, and lay close in their hiding-place. Soon after\r\ncame a party of twenty-two. They fired on them, killed six, captured\r\none, and escaped with him to Fort William Henry. In October Rogers was\r\npassing with twenty men in two whaleboats through the seeming solitude\r\nof the Narrows when a voice called to them out of the woods. It was that\r\nof Captain Shepherd, of the New Hampshire regiment, who had been\r\ncaptured two months before, and had lately made his escape. He told them\r\nthat the French had the fullest information of the numbers and movements\r\nof the English; that letters often reached them from within the English\r\nlines; and that Lydius, a Dutch trader at Albany, was their principal\r\ncorrespondent.[459] Arriving at Ticonderoga, Rogers cautiously\r\napproached the fort, till, about noon, he saw a sentinel on the road\r\nleading thence to the woods. Followed by five of his men, he walked\r\ndirectly towards him. The man challenged, and Rogers answered in French.\r\nPerplexed for a moment, the soldier suffered him to approach; till,\r\nseeing his mistake, he called out in amazement, \"_Qui êtes vous_?\"\r\n\"Rogers,\" was the answer; and the sentinel was seized, led in hot haste\r\nto the boats, and carried to the English fort, where he gave important\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 459: _Letter and Order Books of Winslow_. \"One Lydiass ...\r\nwhom we suspect for a French spy; he lives better than anybody, without\r\nany visible means, and his daughters have had often presents from Mr.\r\nVaudreuil.\" _Loudon_ (_to Fox?_), _19 Aug. 1756_.]\r\n\r\nAn exploit of Rogers towards midsummer greatly perplexed the French. He\r\nembarked at the end of June with fifty men in five whaleboats, made\r\nlight and strong, expressly for this service, rowed about ten miles down\r\nLake George, landed on the east side, carried the boats six miles over a\r\ngorge of the mountains, launched them again in South Bay, and rowed down\r\nthe narrow prolongation of Lake Champlain under cover of darkness. At\r\ndawn they were within six miles of Ticonderoga. They landed, hid their\r\nboats, and lay close all day. Embarking again in the evening, they rowed\r\nwith muffled oars under the shadow of the eastern shore, and passed so\r\nclose to the French fort that they heard the voices of the sentinels\r\ncalling the watchword. In the morning they had left it five miles\r\nbehind. Again they hid in the woods; and from their lurking-place saw\r\nbateaux passing, some northward, and some southward, along the narrow\r\nlake.\r\n\r\nCrown Point was ten or twelve miles farther on. They tried to pass it\r\nafter nightfall, but the sky was too clear and the stars too bright; and\r\nas they lay hidden the next day, nearly a hundred boats passed before\r\nthem on the way to Ticonderoga. Some other boats which appeared about\r\nnoon landed near them, and they watched the soldiers at dinner, within a\r\nmusket-shot of their lurking-place. The next night was more favorable.\r\nThey embarked at nine in the evening, passed Crown Point unseen, and hid\r\nthemselves as before, ten miles below. It was the seventh of July.\r\nThirty boats and a schooner passed them, returning towards Canada. On\r\nthe next night they rowed fifteen miles farther, and then sent men to\r\nreconnoitre, who reported a schooner at anchor about a mile off. They\r\nwere preparing to board her, when two sloops appeared, coming up the\r\nlake at but a short distance from the land. They gave them a volley, and\r\ncalled on them to surrender; but the crews put off in boats and made\r\nfor the opposite shore. They followed and seized them. Out of twelve men\r\ntheir fire had killed three and wounded two, one of whom, says Rogers in\r\nhis report, \"could not march, therefore we put an end to him, to prevent\r\ndiscovery.\"[460] They sank the vessels, which were laden with wine,\r\nbrandy, and flour, hid their boats on the west shore, and returned on\r\nfoot with their prisoners.[461]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 460: _Report of Rogers to Sir William Johnson, July, 1756._\r\nThis incident is suppressed in the printed _Journals_, which merely say\r\nthat the man \"soon died.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 461: _Rogers, Journals, 20. Shirley to Fox, 26 July, 1756._\r\n\"This afternoon Capt. Rogers came down with 4 scalps and 8 prisoners\r\nwhich he took on Lake Champlain, between 20 and 30 miles beyond Crown\r\nPoint.\" _Surgeon Williams to his Wife, 16 July_, 1756.]\r\n\r\nSome weeks after, Rogers returned to the place where he had left the\r\nboats, embarked in them, reconnoitred the lake nearly to St. John, hid\r\nthem again eight miles north of Crown Point, took three prisoners near\r\nthat post, and carried them to Fort William Henry. In the next month the\r\nFrench found several English boats in a small cove north of Crown Point.\r\nBougainville propounds five different hypotheses to account for their\r\nbeing there; and exploring parties were sent out in the vain attempt to\r\nfind some water passage by which they could have reached the spot\r\nwithout passing under the guns of two French forts.[462]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 462: Bougainville, _Journal_.]\r\n\r\nThe French, on their side, still kept their war-parties in motion, and\r\nVaudreuil faithfully chronicled in his despatches every English scalp\r\nthey brought in. He believed in Indians, and sent them to Ticonderoga in\r\nnumbers that were sometimes embarrassing. Even Pottawattamies from Lake\r\nMichigan were prowling about Winslow's camp and silently killing his\r\nsentinels with arrows, while their \"medicine men\" remained at\r\nTiconderoga practising sorcery and divination to aid the warriors or\r\nlearn how it fared with them. Bougainville writes in his Journal on the\r\nfifteenth of October: \"Yesterday the old Pottawattamies who have stayed\r\nhere 'made medicine' to get news of their brethren. The lodge trembled,\r\nthe sorcerer sweated drops of blood, and the devil came at last and told\r\nhim that the warriors would come back with scalps and prisoners. A\r\nsorcerer in the medicine lodge is exactly like the Pythoness on the\r\ntripod or the witch Canidia invoking the shades.\" The diviner was not\r\nwholly at fault. Three days after, the warriors came back with a\r\nprisoner.[463]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 463: This kind of divination was practised by Algonkin tribes\r\nfrom the earliest times.]\r\n\r\nTill November, the hostile forces continued to watch each other from the\r\nopposite ends of Lake George. Loudon repeated his orders to Winslow to\r\nkeep the defensive, and wrote sarcastically to the Colonial Minister: \"I\r\nthink I shall be able to prevent the provincials doing anything very\r\nrash, without their having it in their power to talk in the language of\r\nthis country that they could have taken all Canada if they had not been\r\nprevented by the King's servants.\" Winslow tried to console himself for\r\nthe failure of the campaign, and wrote in his odd English to Shirley:\r\n\"Am sorry that this years' performance has not succeeded as was\r\nintended; have only to say I pushed things to the utmost of my power to\r\nhave been sooner in motion, which was the only thing that should have\r\ncarried us to Crown Point; and though I am sensible that we are doing\r\nour duty in acting on the defensive, yet it makes no _eclate_ [_sic_],\r\nand answers to little purpose in the eyes of my constituents.\"\r\n\r\nOn the first of the month the French began to move off towards Canada,\r\nand before many days Ticonderoga was left in the keeping of five or six\r\ncompanies.[464] Winslow's men followed their example. Major Eyre, with\r\nfour hundred regulars, took possession of Fort William Henry, and the\r\nprovincials marched for home, their ranks thinned by camp diseases and\r\nsmall-pox.[465] In Canada the regulars were quartered on the\r\ninhabitants, who took the infliction as a matter of course. In the\r\nEnglish provinces the question was not so simple. Most of the British\r\ntroops were assigned to Philadelphia, New York, and Boston; and Loudon\r\ndemanded free quarters for them, according to usage then prevailing in\r\nEngland during war. Nor was the demand in itself unreasonable, seeing\r\nthat the troops were sent over to fight the battles of the colonies. In\r\nPhiladelphia lodgings were given them in the public-houses, which,\r\nhowever, could not hold them all. A long dispute followed between the\r\nGovernor, who seconded Loudon's demand, and the Assembly, during which\r\nabout half the soldiers lay on straw in outhouses and sheds till near\r\nmidwinter, many sickening, and some dying from exposure. Loudon grew\r\nfurious, and threatened, if shelter were not provided, to send Webb with\r\nanother regiment and billet the whole on the inhabitants; on which the\r\nAssembly yielded, and quarters were found.[466]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 464: Bougainville, _Journal_. Malartic, _Journal_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 465: _Letter and Order Books of Winslow. Winslow to Halifax,\r\n30 Dec. 1756._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 466: _Loudon to Denny, 28 Oct. 1756. Colonial Records of Pa_.,\r\nVII. 358-380. _Loudon to Pitt, 10 March, 1757. Notice of Colonel\r\nBouquet_, in _Pennsylvania Magazine_, III. 124. _The Conduct of a Noble\r\nCommander in America impartially reviewed_ (1758).]\r\n\r\nIn New York the privates were quartered in barracks, but the officers\r\nwere left to find lodging for themselves. Loudon demanded that provision\r\nshould be made for them also. The city council hesitated, afraid of\r\nincensing the people if they complied. Cruger, the mayor, came to\r\nremonstrate. \"God damn my blood!\" replied the Earl; \"if you do not\r\nbillet my officers upon free quarters this day, I'll order here all the\r\ntroops in North America, and billet them myself upon this city.\" Being\r\nno respecter of persons, at least in the provinces, he began with Oliver\r\nDelancey, brother of the late acting Governor, and sent six soldiers to\r\nlodge under his roof. Delancey swore at the unwelcome guests, on which\r\nLoudon sent him six more. A subscription was then raised among the\r\ncitizens, and the required quarters were provided.[467] In Boston there\r\nwas for the present less trouble. The troops were lodged in the barracks\r\nof Castle William, and furnished with blankets, cooking utensils, and\r\nother necessaries.[468]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 467: Smith, _Hist. of N.Y._, Part II. 242. _William Carry to\r\nJohnson, 15 Jan. 1757_, in Stone, _Life of Sir William Johnson_, II. 24,\r\n_note. Loudon to Hardy, 21 Nov. 1756._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 468: Massachusetts Archives, LXXVI. 153.]\r\n\r\nMajor Eyre and his soldiers, in their wilderness exile by the borders of\r\nLake George, whiled the winter away with few other excitements than the\r\nevening howl of wolves from the frozen mountains, or some nocturnal\r\nsavage shooting at a sentinel from behind a stump on the moonlit fields\r\nof snow. A livelier incident at last broke the monotony of their lives.\r\nIn the middle of January Rogers came with his rangers from Fort Edward,\r\nbound on a scouting party towards Crown Point. They spent two days at\r\nFort William Henry in making snow-shoes and other preparation, and set\r\nout on the seventeenth. Captain Spikeman was second in command, with\r\nLieutenants Stark and Kennedy, several other subalterns, and two\r\ngentlemen volunteers enamoured of adventure. They marched down the\r\nfrozen lake and encamped at the Narrows. Some of them, unaccustomed to\r\nsnow-shoes, had become unfit for travel, and were sent back, thus\r\nreducing the number to seventy-four. In the morning they marched again,\r\nby icicled rocks and ice-bound waterfalls, mountains gray with naked\r\nwoods and fir-trees bowed down with snow. On the nineteenth they reached\r\nthe west shore, about four miles south of Rogers Rock, marched west of\r\nnorth eight miles, and bivouacked among the mountains. On the next\r\nmorning they changed their course, marched east of north all day, passed\r\nTiconderoga undiscovered, and stopped at night some five miles beyond\r\nit. The weather was changing, and rain was coming on. They scraped away\r\nthe snow with their snow-shoes, piled in it a bank around them, made\r\nbeds of spruce-boughs, built fires, and lay down to sleep, while the\r\nsentinels kept watch in the outer gloom. In the morning there was a\r\ndrizzling rain, and the softened snow stuck to their snow-shoes. They\r\nmarched eastward three miles through the dripping forest, til they\r\nreached the banks of Lake Champlain, near what is now called Five Mile\r\nPoint, and presently saw a sledge, drawn by horses, moving on the ice\r\nfrom Ticonderoga towards Crown Point. Rogers sent Stark along the shore\r\nto the left to head it off, while he with another party, covered by the\r\nwoods, moved in the opposite direction to stop its retreat. He soon saw\r\neight or ten more sledges following the first, and sent a messenger to\r\nprevent Stark from showing himself too soon; but Stark was already on\r\nthe ice.\r\n\r\nAll the sledges turned back in hot haste. The rangers ran in pursuit and\r\ncaptured three of them, with seven men and six horses, while the rest\r\nescaped to Ticonderoga. The prisoners, being separately examined, told\r\nan ominous tale. There were three hundred and fifty regulars at\r\nTiconderoga; two hundred Canadians and forty-five Indians had lately\r\narrived there, and more Indians were expected that evening,--all\r\ndestined to waylay the communications between the English forts, and all\r\nprepared to march at a moment's notice. The rangers were now in great\r\nperil. The fugitives would give warning of their presence, and the\r\nFrench and Indians, in overwhelming force, would no doubt cut off their\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nRogers at once ordered his men to return to their last night's\r\nencampment, rekindle the fires, and dry their guns, which were wet by\r\nthe rain of the morning. Then they marched southward in single file\r\nthrough the snow-encumbered forest, Rogers and Kennedy in the front,\r\nSpikeman in the centre, and Stark in the rear. In this order they moved\r\non over broken and difficult ground till two in the afternoon, when they\r\ncame upon a valley, or hollow, scarcely a musket-shot wide, which ran\r\nacross their line of march, and, like all the rest of the country, was\r\nburied in thick woods. The front of the line had descended the first\r\nhill, and was mounting that on the farther side, when the foremost men\r\nheard a low clicking sound, like the cocking of a great number of guns;\r\nand in an instant a furious volley blazed out of the bushes on the ridge\r\nabove them. Kennedy was killed outright, as also was Gardner, one of the\r\nvolunteers. Rogers was grazed in the head by a bullet, and others were\r\ndisabled or hurt. The rest returned the fire, while a swarm of French\r\nand Indians rushed upon them from the ridge and the slopes on either\r\nhand, killing several more, Spikeman among the rest, and capturing\r\nothers. The rangers fell back across the hollow and regained the hill\r\nthey had just descended. Stark with the rear, who were at the top when\r\nthe fray began, now kept the assailants in check by a brisk fire till\r\ntheir comrades joined them. Then the whole party, spreading themselves\r\namong the trees that covered the declivity, stubbornly held their ground\r\nand beat back the French in repeated attempts to dislodge them. As the\r\nassailants were more than two to one, what Rogers had most to dread was\r\na movement to outflank him and get into his rear. This they tried twice,\r\nand were twice repulsed by a party held in reserve for the purpose. The\r\nfight lasted several hours, during which there was much talk between the\r\ncombatants. The French called out that it was a pity so many brave men\r\nshould be lost, that large reinforcements were expected every moment,\r\nand that the rangers would then be cut to pieces without mercy; whereas\r\nif they surrendered at once they should be treated with the utmost\r\nkindness. They called to Rogers by name, and expressed great esteem for\r\nhim. Neither threats nor promises had any effect, and the firing went on\r\ntill darkness stopped it. Towards evening Rogers was shot through the\r\nwrist; and one of the men, John Shute, used to tell in his old age how\r\nhe saw another ranger trying to bind the captain's wound with the ribbon\r\nof his own queue.\r\n\r\nAs Ticonderoga was but three miles off, it was destruction to stay where\r\nthey were; and they withdrew under cover of night, reduced to\r\nforty-eight effective and six wounded men. Fourteen had been killed, and\r\nsix captured. Those that were left reached Lake George in the morning,\r\nand Stark, with two followers, pushed on in advance to bring a sledge\r\nfor the wounded. The rest made their way to the Narrows, where they\r\nencamped, and presently descried a small dark object on the ice far\r\nbehind them. It proved to be one of their own number, Sergeant Joshua\r\nMartin, who had received a severe wound in the fight, and was left for\r\ndead; but by desperate efforts had followed on their tracks, and was now\r\nbrought to camp in a state of exhaustion. He recovered, and lived to an\r\nadvanced age. The sledge sent by Stark came in the morning, and the\r\nwhole party soon reached the fort. Abercromby, on hearing of the affair,\r\nsent them a letter of thanks for gallant conduct.\r\n\r\nRogers reckons the number of his assailants at about two hundred and\r\nfifty in all. Vaudreuil says that they consisted of eighty-nine regulars\r\nand ninety Canadians and Indians. With his usual boastful exaggeration,\r\nhe declares that forty English were left dead on the field, and that\r\nonly three reached Fort William Henry alive. He says that the fight was\r\nextremely hot and obstinate, and admits that the French lost\r\nthirty-seven killed and wounded. Rogers makes the number much greater.\r\nThat it was considerable is certain, as Lusignan, commandant at\r\nTiconderoga, wrote immediately for reinforcements.[469]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 469: Rogers, _Journals_, 38-44. Caleb Stark, _Memoir and\r\nCorrespondence of John Stark_, 18, 412. _Return of Killed, Wounded, and\r\nMissing in the Action near Ticonderoga, Jan. 1757_; all the names are\r\nhere given. James Abercromby, aide-de-camp to his uncle, General\r\nAbercromby, wrote to Rogers from Albany: \"You cannot imagine how all\r\nranks of people here are pleased with your conduct and your men's\r\nbehavior.\"\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the French writers differ from each other, but agree in\r\nplacing the English force at from seventy to eighty, and their own much\r\nhigher. The principal report is that of _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 19\r\nAvril, 1757_ (his second letter of this date). Bougainville, Montcalm,\r\nMalartic, and Montreuil all speak of the affair, placing the English\r\nloss much higher than is shown by the returns. The story, repeated in\r\nmost of the French narratives, that only three of the rangers reached\r\nFort William Henry, seems to have arisen from the fact that Stark with\r\ntwo men went thither in advance of the rest. As regards the antecedents\r\nof the combat, the French and English accounts agree.]\r\n\r\nThe effects of his wound and an attack of small-pox kept Rogers quiet\r\nfor a time. Meanwhile the winter dragged slowly away, and the ice of\r\nLake George, cracking with change of temperature, uttered its strange\r\ncry of agony, heralding that dismal season when winter begins to relax\r\nits grip, but spring still holds aloof; when the sap stirs in the\r\nsugar-maples, but the buds refuse to swell, and even the catkins of the\r\nwillows will not burst their brown integuments; when the forest is\r\npatched with snow, though on its sunny slopes one hears in the stillness\r\nthe whisper of trickling waters that ooze from the half-thawed soil and\r\nsaturated beds of fallen leaves; when clouds hang low on the darkened\r\nmountains, and cold mists entangle themselves in the tops of the pines;\r\nnow a dull rain, now a sharp morning frost, and now a storm of snow\r\npowdering the waste, and wrapping it again in the pall of winter.\r\n\r\nIn this cheerless season, on St. Patrick's Day, the seventeenth of\r\nMarch, the Irish soldiers who formed a part of the garrison of Fort\r\nWilliam Henry were paying homage to their patron saint in libations of\r\nheretic rum, the product of New England stills; and it is said that John\r\nStark's rangers forgot theological differences in their zeal to share\r\nthe festivity. The story adds that they were restrained by their\r\ncommander, and that their enforced sobriety proved the saving of the\r\nfort. This may be doubted; for without counting the English soldiers of\r\nthe garrison who had no special call to be drunk that day, the fort was\r\nin no danger till twenty-four hours after, when the revellers had had\r\ntime to rally from their pious carouse. Whether rangers or British\r\nsoldiers, it is certain that watchmen were on the alert during the night\r\nbetween the eighteenth and nineteenth, and that towards one in the\r\nmorning they heard a sound of axes far down the lake, followed by the\r\nfaint glow of a distant fire. The inference was plain, that an enemy was\r\nthere, and that the necessity of warming himself had overcome his\r\ncaution. Then all was still for some two hours, when, listening in the\r\npitchy darkness, the watchers heard the footsteps of a great body of men\r\napproaching on the ice, which at the time was bare of snow. The garrison\r\nwere at their posts, and all the cannon on the side towards the lake\r\nvomited grape and round-shot in the direction of the sound, which\r\nthereafter was heard no more.\r\n\r\nThose who made it were a detachment, called by Vaudreuil an army, sent\r\nby him to seize the English fort. Shirley had planned a similar stroke\r\nagainst Ticonderoga a year before; but the provincial levies had come in\r\nso slowly, and the ice had broken up so soon, that the scheme was\r\nabandoned. Vaudreuil was more fortunate. The whole force, regulars,\r\nCanadians, and Indians, was ready to his hand. No pains were spared in\r\nequipping them. Overcoats, blankets, bear-skins to sleep on, tarpaulins\r\nto sleep under, spare moccasons, spare mittens, kettles, axes, needles,\r\nawls, flint and steel, and many miscellaneous articles were provided, to\r\nbe dragged by the men on light Indian sledges, along with provisions for\r\ntwelve days. The cost of the expedition is set at a million francs,\r\nanswering to more than as many dollars of the present time. To the\r\ndisgust of the officers from France, the Governor named his brother\r\nRigaud for the chief command; and before the end of February the whole\r\nparty was on its march along the ice of Lake Champlain. They rested\r\nnearly a week at Ticonderoga, where no less than three hundred short\r\nscaling-ladders, so constructed that two or more could be joined in one,\r\nhad been made for them; and here, too, they received a reinforcement,\r\nwhich raised their number to sixteen hundred. Then, marching three days\r\nalong Lake George, they neared the fort on the evening of the\r\neighteenth, and prepared for a general assault before daybreak.\r\n\r\nThe garrison, including rangers, consisted of three hundred and\r\nforty-six effective men.[470] The fort was not strong, and a resolute\r\nassault by numbers so superior must, it seems, have overpowered the\r\ndefenders; but the Canadians and Indians who composed most of the\r\nattacking force were not suited for such work; and, disappointed in his\r\nhope of a surprise, Rigaud withdrew them at daybreak, after trying in\r\nvain to burn the buildings outside. A few hours after, the whole body\r\nreappeared, filing off to surround the fort, on which they kept up a\r\nbrisk but harmless fire of musketry. In the night they were heard again\r\non the ice, approaching as if for an assault; and the cannon, firing\r\ntowards the sound, again drove them back. There was silence for a while,\r\ntill tongues of flame lighted up the gloom, and two sloops, ice-bound in\r\nthe lake, and a large number of bateaux on the shore were seen to be on\r\nfire. A party sallied to save them; but it was too late. In the morning\r\nthey were all consumed, and the enemy had vanished.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 470: _Strength of the Garrison of Fort William Henry when the\r\nEnemy came before it_, enclosed in the letter of _Major Eyre to Loudon,\r\n26 March, 1757_. There were also one hundred and twenty-eight invalids.]\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday, the twentieth. Everything was quiet till noon, when the\r\nFrench filed out of the woods and marched across the ice in procession,\r\nostentatiously carrying their scaling-ladders, and showing themselves to\r\nthe best effect. They stopped at a safe distance, fronting towards the\r\nfort, and several of them advanced, waving a red flag. An officer with a\r\nfew men went to meet them, and returned bringing Le Mercier, chief of\r\nthe Canadian artillery, who, being led blindfold into the fort,\r\nannounced himself as bearer of a message from Rigaud. He was conducted\r\nto the room of Major Eyre, where all the British officers were\r\nassembled; and, after mutual compliments, he invited them to give up the\r\nplace peaceably, promising the most favorable terms, and threatening a\r\ngeneral assault and massacre in case of refusal. Eyre said that he\r\nshould defend himself to the last; and the envoy, again blindfolded, was\r\nled back to whence he came.\r\n\r\nThe whole French force now advanced as if to storm the works, and the\r\ngarrison prepared to receive them. Nothing came of it but a fusillade,\r\nto which the British made no reply. At night the French were heard\r\nadvancing again, and each man nerved himself for the crisis. The real\r\nattack, however, was not against the fort, but against the buildings\r\noutside, which consisted of several storehouses, a hospital, a saw-mill,\r\nand the huts of the rangers, besides a sloop on the stocks and piles of\r\nplanks and cord-wood. Covered by the night, the assailants crept up with\r\nfagots of resinous sticks, placed them against the farther side of the\r\nbuildings, kindled them, and escaped before the flame rose; while the\r\ngarrison, straining their ears in the thick darkness, fired wherever\r\nthey heard a sound. Before morning all around them was in a blaze, and\r\nthey had much ado to save the fort barracks from the shower of burning\r\ncinders. At ten o'clock the fires had subsided, and a thick fall of snow\r\nbegan, filling the air with a restless chaos of large moist flakes. This\r\nlasted all day and all the next night, till the ground and the ice were\r\ncovered to a depth of three feet and more. The French lay close in their\r\ncamps till a little before dawn on Tuesday morning, when twenty\r\nvolunteers from the regulars made a bold attempt to burn the sloop on\r\nthe stocks, with several storehouses and other structures, and several\r\nhundred scows and whaleboats which had thus far escaped. They were only\r\nin part successful; but they fired the sloop and some buildings near it,\r\nand stood far out on the ice watching the flaming vessel, a superb\r\nbonfire amid the wilderness of snow. The spectacle cost the volunteers a\r\nfourth of their number killed and wounded.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday morning the sun rose bright on a scene of wintry splendor,\r\nand the frozen lake was dotted with Rigaud's retreating followers\r\ntoiling towards Canada on snow-shoes. Before they reached it many of\r\nthem were blinded for a while by the insufferable glare, and their\r\ncomrades led them homewards by the hand.[471]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 471: _Eyre to Loudon, 24 March, 1757.

As the aerial travellers winged their\r\nway, the seat of war lay spread beneath them like a map. First the blue\r\nHudson, slumbering among its forests, with the forts along its banks,\r\nHalf-Moon, Stillwater, Saratoga, and the geometric lines and earthen\r\nmounds of Fort Edward. Then a broad belt of dingy evergreen; and beyond,\r\nreleased from wintry fetters, the glistening breast of Lake George, with\r\nFort William Henry at its side, amid charred ruins and a desolation of\r\nprostrate forests. Hence the lake stretched northward, like some broad\r\nriver, trenched between mountain ranges still leafless and gray. Then\r\nthey looked down on Ticonderoga, with the flag of the Bourbons, like a\r\nflickering white speck, waving on its ramparts; and next on Crown Point\r\nwith its tower of stone. Lake Champlain now spread before them, widening\r\nas they flew: on the left, the mountain wilderness of the Adirondacks,\r\nlike a stormy sea congealed; on the right, the long procession of the\r\nGreen Mountains; and, far beyond, on the dim verge of the eastern sky,\r\nthe White Mountains throned in savage solitude. They passed over the\r\nbastioned square of Fort St. John, Fort Chambly guarding the rapids of\r\nthe Richelieu, and the broad belt of the St. Lawrence, with Montreal\r\nseated on its bank. Here we leave them, to build their nests and hatch\r\ntheir brood among the fens of the lonely North.\r\n\r\nMontreal, the military heart of Canada, was in the past winter its\r\nsocial centre also, where were gathered conspicuous representatives both\r\nof Old France and of New; not men only, but women. It was a sparkling\r\nfragment of the reign of Louis XV. dropped into the American wilderness.\r\nMontcalm was here with his staff and his chief officers, now pondering\r\nschemes of war, and now turning in thought to his beloved Château of\r\nCandiac, his mother, children, and wife, to whom he sent letters with\r\nevery opportunity. To his wife he writes: \"Think of me affectionately;\r\ngive love to my girls. I hope next year I may be with you all. I love\r\nyou tenderly, dearest.\" He says that he has sent her a packet of\r\nmarten-skins for a muff, \"and another time I shall send some to our\r\ndaughter; but I should like better to bring them myself.\" Of this eldest\r\ndaughter he writes in reply to a letter of domestic news from Madame de\r\nMontcalm: \"The new gown with blonde trimmings must be becoming, for she\r\nis pretty.\" Again, \"There is not an hour in the day when I do not think\r\nof you, my mother and my children.\" He had the tastes of a country\r\ngentleman, and was eager to know all that was passing on his estate.\r\nBefore leaving home he had set up a mill to grind olives for oil, and\r\nwas well pleased to hear of its prosperity. \"It seems to be a good\r\nthing, which pleases me very much. Bougainville and I talk a great deal\r\nabout the oil-mill.\" Some time after, when the King sent him the coveted\r\ndecoration of the _cordon rouge_, he informed Madame de Montcalm of the\r\nhonor done him, and added: \"But I think I am better pleased with what\r\nyou tell me of the success of my oil-mill.\"\r\n\r\nTo his mother he writes of his absorbing occupations, and says: \"You can\r\ntell my dearest that I have no time to occupy myself with the ladies,\r\neven if I wished to.\" Nevertheless he now and then found leisure for\r\nsome little solace in his banishment; for he writes to Bourlamaque,\r\nwhom he had left at Quebec, after a visit which he had himself made\r\nthere early in the winter: \"I am glad you sometimes speak of me to the\r\nthree ladies in the Rue du Parloir; and I am flattered by their\r\nremembrance, especially by that of one of them, in whom I find at\r\ncertain moments too much wit and too many charms for my tranquillity.\"\r\nThese ladies of the Rue du Parloir are several times mentioned in his\r\nfamiliar correspondence with Bourlamaque.\r\n\r\nHis station obliged him to maintain a high standard of living, to his\r\ngreat financial detriment, for Canadian prices were inordinate. \"I must\r\nlive creditably, and so I do; sixteen persons at table every day. Once a\r\nfortnight I dine with the Governor-General and with the Chevalier de\r\nLévis, who lives well too. He has given three grand balls. As for me, up\r\nto Lent I gave, besides dinners, great suppers, with ladies, three times\r\na week. They lasted till two in the morning; and then there was dancing,\r\nto which company came uninvited, but sure of a welcome from those who\r\nhad been at supper. It is very expensive, not very amusing, and often\r\ntedious. At Quebec, where we spent a month, I gave receptions or\r\nparties, often at the Intendant's house. I like my gallant Chevalier de\r\nLévis very much. Bourlamaque was a good choice; he is steady and cool,\r\nwith good parts. Bougainville has talent, a warm head, and warm heart;\r\nhe will ripen in time. Write to Madame Cornier that I like her husband;\r\nhe is perfectly well, and as impatient for peace as I am. Love to my\r\ndaughters, and all affection and respect to my mother. I live only in\r\nthe hope of joining you all again. Nevertheless, Montreal is as good a\r\nplace as Alais even in time of peace, and better now, because the\r\nGovernment is here; for the Marquis de Vaudreuil, like me, spent only a\r\nmonth at Quebec. As for Quebec, it is as good as the best cities of\r\nFrance, except ten or so. Clear sky, bright sun; neither spring nor\r\nautumn, only summer and winter. July, August, and September, hot as in\r\nLanguedoc: winter insupportable; one must keep always indoors. The\r\nladies _spirituelles, galantes, dévotes_. Gambling at Quebec, dancing\r\nand conversation at Montreal. My friends the Indians, who are often\r\nunbearable, and whom I treat with perfect tranquillity and patience, are\r\nfond of me. If I were not a sort of general, though very subordinate to\r\nthe Governor, I could gossip about the plans of the campaign, which it\r\nis likely will begin on the tenth or fifteenth of May. I worked at the\r\nplan of the last affair [_Rigaud's expedition to Fort William Henry_],\r\nwhich might have turned out better, though good as it was. I wanted\r\nonly eight hundred men. If I had had my way, Monsieur de Lévis or\r\nMonsieur de Bougainville would have had charge of it. However, the thing\r\nwas all right, and in good hands. The Governor, who is extremely civil\r\nto me, gave it to his brother; he thought him more used to winter\r\nmarches. Adieu, my heart; I adore and love you!\"\r\n\r\nTo meet his manifold social needs, he sends to his wife orders for\r\nprunes, olives, anchovies, muscat wine, capers, sausages, confectionery,\r\ncloth for liveries, and many other such items; also for scent-bags of\r\ntwo kinds, and perfumed pomatum for presents; closing in postscript with\r\nan injunction not to forget a dozen pint-bottles of English lavender.\r\nSome months after, he writes to Madame de Saint-Véran: \"I have got\r\neverything that was sent me from Montpellier except the sausages. I have\r\nlost a third of what was sent from Bordeaux. The English captured it on\r\nboard the ship called 'La Superbe;' and I have reason to fear that\r\neverything sent from Paris is lost on board 'La Liberté.' I am running\r\ninto debt here. Pshaw! I must live. I do not worry myself. Best love to\r\nyou, my mother.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Rigaud was about to march with his detachment against Fort William\r\nHenry, Montcalm went over to La Prairie to see them. \"I reviewed them,\"\r\nhe writes to Bourlamaque, \"and gave the officers a dinner, which, if\r\nanybody else had given it, I should have said was a grand affair. There\r\nwere two tables, for thirty-six persons in all. On Wednesday there was\r\nan Assembly at Madame Varin's; on Friday the Chevalier de Lévis gave a\r\nball. He invited sixty-five ladies, and got only thirty, with a great\r\ncrowd of men. Rooms well lighted, excellent order, excellent service,\r\nplenty of refreshments of every sort all through the night; and the\r\ncompany stayed till seven in the morning. As for me, I went to bed\r\nearly. I had had that day eight ladies at a supper given to Madame\r\nVarin. To-morrow I shall have half-a-dozen at another supper, given to I\r\ndon't know whom, but incline to think it will be La Roche Beaucour. The\r\ngallant Chevalier is to give us still another ball.\"\r\n\r\nLent put a check on these festivities. \"To-morrow,\" he tells\r\nBourlamaque, \"I shall throw myself into devotion with might and main (_à\r\ncorps perdu_). It will be easier for me to detach myself from the world\r\nand turn heavenward here at Montreal than it would be at Quebec.\" And,\r\nsome time after, \"Bougainville spent Monday delightfully at Isle Ste.\r\nHélène, and Tuesday devoutly with the Sulpitian Fathers at the Mountain.\r\nI was there myself at four o'clock, and did them the civility to sup in\r\ntheir refectory at a quarter before six.\"\r\n\r\nIn May there was a complete revival of social pleasures, and Montcalm\r\nwrote to Bourlamaque: \"Madame de Beaubassin's supper was very gay. There\r\nwere toasts to the Rue du Parloir and to the General. To-day I must give\r\na dinner to Madame de Saint-Ours, which will be a little more serious.\r\nPéan is gone to establish himself at La Chine, and will come back with\r\nLa Barolon, who goes thither with a husband of hers, bound to the Ohio\r\nwith Villejoin and Louvigny. The Chevalier de Lévis amuses himself very\r\nmuch here. He and his friends spend all their time with Madame de\r\nLenisse.\"\r\n\r\nUnder these gayeties and gallantries there were bitter heart-burnings.\r\nMontcalm hints at some of them in a letter to Bourlamaque, written at\r\nthe time of the expedition to Fort William Henry, which, in the words of\r\nMontcalm, who would have preferred another commander, the Governor had\r\nordered to march \"under the banners of brother Rigaud.\" \"After he got my\r\nletter on Sunday evening,\" says the disappointed General, \"Monsieur de\r\nVaudreuil sent me his secretary with the instructions he had given his\r\nbrother,\" which he had hitherto withheld. \"This gave rise after dinner\r\nto a long conversation with him; and I hope for the good of the service\r\nthat his future conduct will prove the truth of his words. I spoke to\r\nhim with frankness and firmness of the necessity I was under of\r\ncommunicating to him my reflections; but I did not name any of the\r\npersons who, to gain his good graces, busy themselves with destroying\r\nhis confidence in me. I told him that he would always find me disposed\r\nto aid in measures tending to our success, even should his views, which\r\nalways ought to prevail, be different from mine; but that I dared\r\nflatter myself that he would henceforward communicate his plans to me\r\nsooner; for, though his knowledge of the country gave greater weight to\r\nhis opinions, he might rest satisfied that I should second him in\r\nmethods and details. This explanation passed off becomingly enough, and\r\nended with a proposal to dine on a moose's nose [_an estimed morsel_]\r\nthe day after to-morrow. I burn your letters, Monsieur, and I beg you to\r\ndo the same with mine, after making a note of anything you may want to\r\nkeep.\" But Bourlamaque kept all the letters, and bound them in a volume,\r\nwhich still exists.[472]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 472: The preceding extracts are from _Lettres de Montcalm à\r\nMadame de Saint-Véran, sa Mère, et à Madame de Montcalm, sa Femme_,\r\n1756, 1757 (_Papiers de Famille_); and _Lettres de Montcalm à\r\nBourlamaque_, 1757. See Appendix E.]\r\n\r\nMontcalm was not at this time fully aware of the feeling of Vaudreuil\r\ntowards him. The touchy egotism of the Governor and his jealous\r\nattachment to the colony led him to claim for himself and the Canadians\r\nthe merit of every achievement and to deny it to the French troops and\r\ntheir general. Before the capture of Oswego was known, he wrote to the\r\nnaval minister that Montcalm would never have dared attack that place if\r\nhe had not encouraged him and answered his timid objections.[473] \"I am\r\nconfident that I shall reduce it,\" he adds; \"my expedition is sure to\r\nsucceed if Monsieur de Montcalm follows the directions I have given\r\nhim.\" When the good news came he immediately wrote again, declaring that\r\nthe victory was due to his brother Rigaud and the Canadians, who, he\r\nsays, had been ill-used by the General, and not allowed either to enter\r\nthe fort or share the plunder, any more than the Indians, who were so\r\nangry at the treatment they had met that he had great difficulty in\r\nappeasing them. He hints that the success was generally ascribed to him.\r\n\"There has been a great deal of talk here; but I will not do myself the\r\nhonor of repeating it to you, especially as it relates to myself. I know\r\nhow to do violence to my self-love. The measures I took assured our\r\nvictory, in spite of opposition. If I had been less vigilant and firm,\r\nOswego would still be in the hands of the English. I cannot sufficiently\r\ncongratulate myself on the zeal which my brother and the Canadians and\r\nIndians showed on this occasion; for without them my orders would have\r\nbeen given in vain. The hopes of His Britannic Majesty have vanished,\r\nand will hardly revive again; for I shall take care to crush them in the\r\nbud.\"[474]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 473: _Vaudreuil au Ministre de la Marine_, 13 _Août_, 1756.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 474: _Vaudreuil au Ministre de la Marine_, 1 _Sept._ 1756.]\r\n\r\nThe pronouns \"I\" and \"my\" recur with monotonous frequency in his\r\ncorrespondence. \"I have laid waste all the British provinces.\" \"By\r\npromptly uniting my forces at Carillon, I have kept General Loudon in\r\ncheck, though he had at his disposal an army of about twenty thousand\r\nmen;\"[475] and so without end, in all varieties of repetition. It is no\r\nless characteristic that he here assigns to his enemies double their\r\nactual force.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 475: _Ibid._, 6 _Nov._ 1756.]\r\n\r\nHe has the faintest of praise for the troops from France. \"They are\r\ngenerally good, but thus far they have not absolutely distinguished\r\nthemselves. I do justice to the firmness they showed at Oswego; but it\r\nwas only the colony troops, Canadians, and Indians who attacked the\r\nforts. Our artillery was directed by the Chevalier Le Mercier and M.\r\nFrémont [_colony officers_], and was served by our colony troops and our\r\nmilitia. The officers from France are more inclined to defence than\r\nattack. Far from spending the least thing here, they lay by their pay.\r\nThey saved the money allowed them for refreshments, and had it in pocket\r\nat the end of the campaign. They get a profit, too, out of their\r\nprovisions, by having certificates made under borrowed names, so that\r\nthey can draw cash for them on their return. It is the same with the\r\nsoldiers, who also sell their provisions to the King and get paid for\r\nthem. In conjunction with M. Bigot, I labor to remedy all these abuses;\r\nand the rules we have established have saved the King a considerable\r\nexpense. M. de Montcalm has complained very much of these rules.\" The\r\nIntendant Bigot, who here appears as a reformer, was the centre of a\r\nmonstrous system of public fraud and robbery; while the charges against\r\nthe French officers are unsupported. Vaudreuil, who never loses an\r\nopportunity of disparaging them, proceeds thus:--\r\n\r\n\"The troops from France are not on very good terms with our Canadians.\r\nWhat can the soldiers think of them when they see their officers\r\nthreaten them with sticks or swords? The Canadians are obliged to carry\r\nthese gentry on their shoulders, through the cold water, over rocks that\r\ncut their feet; and if they make a false step they are abused. Can\r\nanything be harder? Finally, Monsieur de Montcalm is so quick-tempered\r\nthat he goes to the length of striking the Canadians. How can he\r\nrestrain his officers when he cannot restrain himself? Could any example\r\nbe more contagious? This is the way our Canadians are treated. They\r\ndeserve something better.\" He then enlarges on their zeal, hardihood,\r\nand bravery, and adds that nothing but their blind submission to his\r\ncommands prevents many of them from showing resentment at the usage they\r\nhad to endure. The Indians, he goes on to say, are not so gentle and\r\nyielding; and but for his brother Rigaud and himself, might have gone\r\noff in a rage. \"After the campaign of Oswego they did not hesitate to\r\ntell me that they would go wherever I sent them, provided I did not put\r\nthem under the orders of M. de Montcalm. They told me positively that\r\nthey could not bear his quick temper. I shall always maintain the most\r\nperfect union and understanding with M. le Marquis de Montcalm, but I\r\nshall be forced to take measures which will assure to our Canadians and\r\nIndians treatment such as their zeal and services merit.\"[476]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 476: _Vaudreuil au Ministre de la Marine, 23 Oct. 1756_. The\r\nabove extracts are somewhat condensed in the translation. See the letter\r\nin Dussieux, 279.]\r\n\r\nTo the subject of his complaints Vaudreuil used a different language;\r\nfor Montcalm says, after mentioning that he had had occasion to punish\r\nsome of the Canadians at Oswego: \"I must do Monsieur de Vaudreuil the\r\njustice to say that he approved my proceedings.\" He treated the General\r\nwith the blandest politeness. \"He is a good-natured man,\" continues\r\nMontcalm, \"mild, with no character of his own, surrounded by people who\r\ntry to destroy all his confidence in the general of the troops from\r\nFrance. I am praised excessively, in order to make him jealous, excite\r\nhis Canadian prejudices, and prevent him from dealing with me frankly,\r\nor adopting my views when he can help it.\"[477] He elsewhere complains\r\nthat Vaudreuil gave to both him and Lévis orders couched in such\r\nequivocal terms that he could throw the blame on them in case of\r\nreverse.[478] Montcalm liked the militia no better than the Governor\r\nliked the regulars. \"I have used them with good effect, though not in\r\nplaces exposed to the enemy's fire. They know neither discipline nor\r\nsubordination, and think themselves in all respects the first nation on\r\nearth.\" He is sure, however, that they like him: \"I have gained the\r\nutmost confidence of the Canadians and Indians; and in the eyes of the\r\nformer, when I travel or visit their camps, I have the air of a tribune\r\nof the people.\"[479] \"The affection of the Indians for me is so strong\r\nthat there are moments when it astonishes the Governor.\"[480] \"The\r\nIndians are delighted with me,\" he says in another letter; \"the\r\nCanadians are pleased with me; their officers esteem and fear me, and\r\nwould be glad if the French troops and their general could be dispensed\r\nwith; and so should I.\"[481] And he writes to his mother: \"The part I\r\nhave to play is unique: I am a general-in-chief subordinated; sometimes\r\nwith everything to do, and sometimes nothing; I am esteemed, respected,\r\nbeloved, envied, hated; I pass for proud, supple, stiff, yielding,\r\npolite, devout, gallant, etc.; and I long for peace.\"[482]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 477: _Montcalm au Ministre de la Guerre, 11 Juillet, 1757._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 478: _Montcalm au Ministre de la Guerre, 1 Nov. 1756._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 479: _Ibid., 18 Sept. 1757._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 480: _Ibid., 4 Nov. 1757._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 481: _Ibid., 28 Août, 1756._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 482: _Montcalm à Madame de Saint-Véran, 23 Sept. 1757._]\r\n\r\nThe letters of the Governor and those of the General, it will be seen,\r\ncontradict each other flatly at several points. Montcalm is sustained by\r\nhis friend Bougainville, who says that the Indians had a great liking\r\nfor him, and that he \"knew how to manage them as well as if he had been\r\nborn in their wigwams.\"[483] And while Vaudreuil complains that the\r\nCanadians are ill-used by Montcalm, Bougainville declares that the\r\nregulars are ill-used by Vaudreuil. \"One must be blind not to see that\r\nwe are treated as the Spartans treated the Helots.\" Then he comments on\r\nthe jealous reticence of the Governor. \"The Marquis de Montcalm has not\r\nthe honor of being consulted; and it is generally through public rumor\r\nthat he first hears of Monsieur de Vaudreuil's military plans.\" He calls\r\nthe Governor \"a timid man, who can neither make a resolution nor keep\r\none;\" and he gives another trait of him, illustrating it, after his\r\nusual way, by a parallel from the classics: \"When V. produces an idea he\r\nfalls in love with it, as Pygmalion did with his statue. I can forgive\r\nPygmalion, for what he produced was a masterpiece.\"[484]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 483: _Bougainville à Saint-Laurens, 19 Août, 1757._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 484: Bougainville, _Journal_.]\r\n\r\nThe exceeding touchiness of the Governor was sorely tried by certain\r\nindiscretions on the part of the General, who in his rapid and vehement\r\nutterances sometimes forgot the rules of prudence. His anger, though not\r\ndeep, was extremely impetuous; and it is said that his irritation\r\nagainst Vaudreuil sometimes found escape in the presence of servants and\r\nsoldiers.[485] There was no lack of reporters, and the Governor was told\r\neverything. The breach widened apace, and Canada divided itself into two\r\ncamps: that of Vaudreuil with the colony officers, civil and military,\r\nand that of Montcalm with the officers from France. The principal\r\nexception was the Chevalier de Lévis. This brave and able commander had\r\nan easy and adaptable nature, which made him a sort of connecting link\r\nbetween the two parties. \"One should be on good terms with everybody,\"\r\nwas a maxim which he sometimes expressed, and on which he shaped his\r\nconduct with notable success. The Intendant Bigot also, an adroit and\r\naccomplished person, had the skill to avoid breaking with either side.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 485: _Événements de la Guerre en Canada, 1759, 1760._]\r\n\r\nBut now the season of action was near, and domestic strife must give\r\nplace to efforts against the common foe. \"God or devil!\" Montcalm wrote\r\nto Bourlamaque, \"we must do something and risk a fight. If we succeed,\r\nwe can, all three of us [_you, Lévis, and I_], ask for promotion. Burn\r\nthis letter.\" The prospects, on the whole, were hopeful. The victory at\r\nOswego had wrought marvels among the Indians, inspired the faithful,\r\nconfirmed the wavering, and daunted the ill-disposed. The whole West was\r\nastir, ready to pour itself again in blood and fire against the English\r\nborder; and even the Cherokees and Choctaws, old friends of the British\r\ncolonies, seemed on the point of turning against them.[486] The Five\r\nNations were half won for France. In November a large deputation of them\r\ncame to renew the chain of friendship at Montreal. \"I have laid Oswego\r\nin ashes,\" said Vaudreuil; \"the English quail before me. Why do you\r\nnourish serpents in your bosom? They mean only to enslave you.\" The\r\ndeputies trampled under foot the medals the English had given them, and\r\npromised the \"Devourer of Villages,\" for so they styled the Governor,\r\nthat they would never more lift the hatchet against his children. The\r\nchief difficulty was to get rid of them; for, being clothed and fed at\r\nthe expense of the King, they were in no haste to take leave; and\r\nlearning that New Year's Day was a time of visits, gifts, and\r\nhealth-drinking, they declared that they would stay to share its\r\npleasures; which they did, to their own satisfaction and the annoyance\r\nof those who were forced to entertain them and their squaws.[487] An\r\nactive siding with France was to be expected only from the western bands\r\nof the Confederacy. Neutrality alone could be hoped for from the others,\r\nwho were too near the English safely to declare against them; while from\r\none of the tribes, the Mohawks, even neutrality was doubtful.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 486: _Vaudreuil au Ministre de la Marine, 19 Avril, 1757_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 487: _Montcalm au Ministre de la Guerre, 24 Avril, 1757;\r\nRelation de l'Ambassade des Cinq Nations à Montreal, jointe á la lettre\r\nprécédente. Procès-verbal de différentes Entrevues entre M. de Vaudreuil\r\net les Deputés des Nations sauvages du 13 au 30 Déc. 1756. Malartic,\r\nJournal. Montcalm á Madame de Saint-Véran, 1 Avril, 1757_.]\r\n\r\nVaudreuil, while disliking the French regulars, felt that he could not\r\ndispense with them, and had asked for a reinforcement. His request was\r\ngranted; and the Colonial Minister informed him that twenty-four hundred\r\nmen had been ordered to Canada to strengthen the colony regulars and the\r\nbattalions of Montcalm.[488] This, according to the estimate of the\r\nMinister, would raise the regular force in Canada to sixty-six hundred\r\nrank and file.[489] The announcement was followed by another, less\r\nagreeable. It was to the effect that a formidable squadron was fitting\r\nout in British ports. Was Quebec to be attacked, or Louisbourg?\r\nLouisbourg was beyond reach of succor from Canada; it must rely on its\r\nown strength and on help from France. But so long as Quebec was\r\nthreatened, all the troops in the colony must be held ready to defend\r\nit, and the hope of attacking England in her own domains must be\r\nabandoned. Till these doubts were solved, nothing could be done; and\r\nhence great activity in catching prisoners for the sake of news. A few\r\nwere brought in, but they knew no more of the matter than the French\r\nthemselves; and Vaudreuil and Montcalm rested for a while in suspense.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 488: _Ordres du Roy et Dépêches des Ministres, Mars, 1757._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 489: _Ministerial Minute on the Military Force in Canada,\r\n1757,_ in _N.Y. Col. Docs_., X. 523.]\r\n\r\nThe truth, had they known it, would have gladdened their hearts. The\r\nEnglish preparations were aimed at Louisbourg. In the autumn before,\r\nLoudon, prejudiced against all plans of his predecessor, Shirley,\r\nproposed to the Ministry a scheme of his own, involving a possible\r\nattack on Quebec, but with the reduction of Louisbourg as its immediate\r\nobject,--an important object, no doubt, but one that had no direct\r\nbearing on the main question of controlling the interior of the\r\ncontinent. Pitt, then for a brief space at the head of the Government,\r\naccepted the suggestion, and set himself to executing it; but he was\r\nhampered by opposition, and early in April was forced to resign. Then,\r\nfollowed a contest of rival claimants to office; and the war against\r\nFrance was made subordinate to disputes of personal politics. Meanwhile\r\none Florence Hensey, a spy at London, had informed the French Court that\r\na great armament was fitting out for America, though he could not tell\r\nits precise destination. Without loss of time three French squadrons\r\nwere sent across the Atlantic, with orders to rendezvous at Louisbourg,\r\nthe conjectured point of attack.\r\n\r\nThe English were as tardy as their enemies were prompt. Everything\r\ndepended on speed; yet their fleet, under Admiral Holbourne, consisting\r\nof fifteen ships of the line and three frigates, with about five\r\nthousand troops on board, did not get to sea till the fifth of May, when\r\nit made sail for Halifax, where Loudon was to meet it with additional\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nLoudon had drawn off the best part of the troops from the northern\r\nfrontier, and they were now at New York waiting for embarkation. That\r\nthe design might be kept secret, he laid an embargo on colonial\r\nshipping,--a measure which exasperated the colonists without answering\r\nits purpose. Now ensued a long delay, during which the troops, the\r\nprovincial levies, the transports destined to carry them, and the ships\r\nof war which were to serve as escort, all lay idle. In the interval\r\nLoudon showed great activity in writing despatches and other avocations\r\nmore or less proper to a commander, being always busy, without,\r\naccording to Franklin, accomplishing anything. One Innis, who had come\r\nwith a message from the Governor of Pennsylvania, and had waited above a\r\nfortnight for the General's reply, remarked of him that he was like St.\r\nGeorge on a tavern sign, always on horseback, and never riding on.[490]\r\nYet nobody longed more than he to reach the rendezvous at Halifax. He\r\nwas waiting for news of Holbourne, and he waited in vain. He knew only\r\nthat a French fleet had been seen off the coast strong enough to\r\noverpower his escort and sink all his transports.[491] But the season\r\nwas growing late; he must act quickly if he was to act at all. He and\r\nSir Charles Hardy agreed between them that the risk must be run; and on\r\nthe twentieth of June the whole force put to sea. They met no enemy, and\r\nentered Halifax harbor on the thirtieth. Holbourne and his fleet had not\r\nyet appeared; but his ships soon came straggling in, and before the\r\ntenth of July all were at anchor before the town. Then there was more\r\ndelay. The troops, nearly twelve thousand in all, were landed, and weeks\r\nwere spent in drilling them and planting vegetables for their\r\nrefreshment. Sir Charles Hay was put under arrest for saying that the\r\nnation's money was spent in sham battles and raising cabbages. Some\r\nattempts were made to learn the state of Louisbourg; and Captain Gorham,\r\nof the rangers, who reconnoitred it from a fishing vessel, brought back\r\nan imperfect report, upon which, after some hesitation, it was resolved\r\nto proceed to the attack. The troops were embarked again, and all was\r\nready, when, on the fourth of August, a sloop came from Newfoundland,\r\nbringing letters found on board a French vessel lately captured. From\r\nthese it appeared that all three of the French squadrons were united in\r\nthe harbor of Louisbourg, to the number of twenty-two ships of the line,\r\nbesides several frigates, and that the garrison had been increased to a\r\ntotal force of seven thousand men, ensconced in the strongest fortress\r\nof the continent. So far as concerned the naval force, the account was\r\ntrue. La Motte, the French admiral, had with him a fleet carrying an\r\naggregate of thirteen hundred and sixty cannon, anchored in a sheltered\r\nharbor under the guns of the town. Success was now hopeless, and the\r\ncostly enterprise was at once abandoned. Loudon with his troops sailed\r\nback for New York, and Admiral Holbourne, who had been joined by four\r\nadditional ships, steered for Louisbourg, in hopes that the French fleet\r\nwould come out and fight him. He cruised off the port; but La Motte did\r\nnot accept the challenge.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 490: _Works of Franklin_, I. 219. Franklin intimates that\r\nwhile Loudon was constantly writing, he rarely sent off despatches. This\r\nis a mistake; there is abundance of them, often tediously long, in the\r\nPublic Record Office.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 491: _Loudon to Pitt_, 30 _May_, 1757. He had not learned\r\nPitt's resignation.]\r\n\r\nThe elements declared for France. A September gale, of fury rare even on\r\nthat tempestuous coast, burst upon the British fleet. \"It blew a perfect\r\nhurricane,\" says the unfortunate Admiral, \"and drove us right on shore.\"\r\nOne ship was dashed on the rocks, two leagues from Louisbourg. A\r\nshifting of the wind in the nick of time saved the rest from total\r\nwreck. Nine were dismasted; others threw their cannon into the sea. Not\r\none was left fit for immediate action; and had La Motte sailed out of\r\nLouisbourg, he would have had them all at his mercy.\r\n\r\nDelay, the source of most of the disasters that befell England and her\r\ncolonies at this dismal epoch, was the ruin of the Louisbourg\r\nexpedition. The greater part of La Motte's fleet reached its destination\r\na full month before that of Holbourne. Had the reverse taken place, the\r\nfortress must have fallen. As it was, the ill-starred attempt, drawing\r\noff the British forces from the frontier, where they were needed most,\r\ndid for France more than she could have done for herself, and gave\r\nMontcalm and Vaudreuil the opportunity to execute a scheme which they\r\nhad nursed since the fall of Oswego.[492]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 492: _Despatches of Loudon, Feb. to Aug_. 1757.

This was not the case. The\r\n_Gazette de France_, 621, says that La Motte had twenty-four ships of\r\nwar. Bougainville says that as early as the ninth of June there were\r\ntwenty-one ships of war, including five frigates, at Louisbourg. To this\r\nthe list given by Knox closely answers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 15\r\n\r\n1757\r\n\r\nFort William Henry\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am going on the ninth to sing the war-song at the Lake of Two\r\nMountains, and on the next day at Saut St. Louis,--a long, tiresome,\r\nceremony. On the twelfth I am off; and I count on having news to tell\r\nyou by the end of this month or the beginning of next.\" Thus Montcalm\r\nwrote to his wife from Montreal early in July. All doubts had been\r\nsolved. Prisoners taken on the Hudson and despatches from Versailles had\r\nmade it certain that Loudon was bound to Louisbourg, carrying with him\r\nthe best of the troops that had guarded the New York frontier. The time\r\nwas come, not only to strike the English on Lake George, but perhaps to\r\nseize Fort Edward and carry terror to Albany itself. Only one difficulty\r\nremained, the want of provisions. Agents were sent to collect corn and\r\nbacon among the inhabitants; the curés and militia captains were ordered\r\nto aid in the work; and enough was presently found to feed twelve\r\nthousand men for a month.[493]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 493: Vaudreuil, _Lettres circulates aux Curés et aux\r\nCapitaines de Milice des Paroisses du Gouvernement de Montreal, 16 Juin,\r\n1757._]\r\n\r\nThe emissaries of the Governor had been busy all winter among the tribes\r\nof the West and North; and more than a thousand savages, lured by\r\nprospect of gifts, scalps, and plunder, were now encamped at Montreal.\r\nMany of them had never visited a French settlement before. All were\r\neager to see Montcalm, whose exploit in taking Oswego had inflamed their\r\nimagination; and one day, on a visit of ceremony, an orator from\r\nMichillimackinac addressed the General thus: \"We wanted to see this\r\nfamous man who tramples the English under his feet. We thought we should\r\nfind him so tall that his head would be lost in the clouds. But you are\r\na little man, my Father. It is when we look into your eyes that we see\r\nthe greatness of the pine-tree and the fire of the eagle.\"[494]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 494: Bougainville, _Journal_.]\r\n\r\nIt remained to muster the Mission Indians settled in or near the limits\r\nof the colony; and it was to this end that Montcalm went to sing the\r\nwar-song with the converts of the Two Mountains. Rigaud, Bougainville,\r\nyoung Longueuil, and others were of the party; and when they landed, the\r\nIndians came down to the shore, their priests at their head, and greeted\r\nthe General with a volley of musketry; then received him after dark in\r\ntheir grand council-lodge, where the circle of wild and savage visages,\r\nhalf seen in the dim light of a few candles, suggested to Bougainville a\r\nmidnight conclave of wizards. He acted vicariously the chief part in the\r\nceremony. \"I sang the war-song in the name of M. de Montcalm, and was\r\nmuch applauded. It was nothing but these words: 'Let us trample the\r\nEnglish under our feet,' chanted over and over again, in cadence with\r\nthe movements of the savages.\" Then came the war-feast, against which\r\noccasion Montcalm had caused three oxen to be roasted.[495] On the next\r\nday the party went to Caughnawaga, or Saut St. Louis, where the ceremony\r\nwas repeated; and Bougainville, who again sang the war-song in the name\r\nof his commander, was requited by adoption into the clan of the Turtle.\r\nThree more oxen were solemnly devoured, and with one voice the warriors\r\ntook up the hatchet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 495: Bougainville describes a ceremony in the Mission Church\r\nof the Two Mountains in which warriors and squaws sang in the choir.\r\nNinety-nine years after, in 1856, I was present at a similar ceremony on\r\nthe same spot, and heard the descendants of the same warriors and squaws\r\nsing like their ancestors. Great changes have since taken place at this\r\nold mission.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile troops, Canadians and Indians, were moving by detachments up\r\nLake Champlain. Fleets of bateaux and canoes followed each other day by\r\nday along the capricious lake, in calm or storm, sunshine or rain, till,\r\ntowards the end of July, the whole force was gathered at Ticonderoga,\r\nthe base of the intended movement. Bourlamaque had been there since May\r\nwith the battalions of Béarn and Royal Roussillon, finishing the fort,\r\nsending out war-parties, and trying to discover the force and designs of\r\nthe English at Fort William Henry.\r\n\r\nTiconderoga is a high rocky promontory between Lake Champlain on the\r\nnorth and the mouth of the outlet of Lake George on the south. Near its\r\nextremity and close to the fort were still encamped the two battalions\r\nunder Bourlamaque, while bateaux and canoes were passing incessantly up\r\nthe river of the outlet. There were scarcely two miles of navigable\r\nwater, at the end of which the stream fell foaming over a high ledge of\r\nrock that barred the way. Here the French were building a saw-mill; and\r\na wide space had been cleared to form an encampment defended on all\r\nsides by an abattis, within which stood the tents of the battalions of\r\nLa Reine, La Sarre, Languedoc, and Guienne, all commanded by Lévis.\r\nAbove the cascade the stream circled through the forest in a series of\r\nbeautiful rapids, and from the camp of Lévis a road a mile and a half\r\nlong had been cut to the navigable water above. At the end of this road\r\nthere was another fortified camp, formed of colony regulars, Canadians,\r\nand Indians, under Rigaud. It was scarcely a mile farther to Lake\r\nGeorge, where on the western side there was an outpost, chiefly of\r\nCanadians and Indians; while advanced parties were stationed at Bald\r\nMountain, now called Rogers Rock, and elsewhere on the lake, to watch\r\nthe movements of the English. The various encampments just mentioned\r\nwere ranged along a valley extending four miles from Lake Champlain to\r\nLake George, and bordered by mountains wooded to the top.\r\n\r\nHere was gathered a martial population of eight thousand men, including\r\nthe brightest civilization and the darkest barbarism: from the\r\nscholar-soldier Montcalm and his no less accomplished aide-de-camp; from\r\nLévis, conspicuous for graces of person; from a throng of courtly young\r\nofficers, who would have seemed out of place in that wilderness had they\r\nnot done their work so well in it; from these to the foulest man eating\r\nsavage of the uttermost northwest.\r\n\r\nOf Indian allies there were nearly two thousand. One of their tribes,\r\nthe Iowas, spoke a language which no interpreter understood; and they\r\nall bivouacked where they saw fit: for no man could control them. \"I see\r\nno difference,\" says Bougainville, \"in the dress, ornaments, dances, and\r\nsongs of the various western nations. They go naked, excepting a strip\r\nof cloth passed through a belt, and paint themselves black, red, blue,\r\nand other colors. Their heads are shaved and adorned with bunches of\r\nfeathers, and they wear rings of brass wire in their ears. They wear\r\nbeaver-skin blankets, and carry lances, bows and arrows, and quivers\r\nmade of the skins of beasts. For the rest they are straight, well made,\r\nand generally very tall. Their religion is brute paganism. I will say it\r\nonce for all, one must be the slave of these savages, listen to them day\r\nand night, in council and in private, whenever the fancy takes them, or\r\nwhenever a dream, a fit of the vapors, or their perpetual craving for\r\nbrandy, gets possession of them; besides which they are always wanting\r\nsomething for their equipment, arms, or toilet, and the general of the\r\narmy must give written orders for the smallest trifle,--an eternal,\r\nwearisome detail, of which one has no idea in Europe.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to keep them fed. Rations would be served to them for a\r\nweek; they would consume them in three days, and come for more. On one\r\noccasion they took the matter into their own hands, and butchered and\r\ndevoured eighteen head of cattle intended for the troops; nor did any\r\nofficer dare oppose this \"St. Bartholomew of the oxen,\" as Bougainville\r\ncalls it. \"Their paradise is to be drunk,\" says the young officer. Their\r\nparadise was rather a hell; for sometimes, when mad with brandy, they\r\ngrappled and tore each other with their teeth like wolves. They were\r\ncontinually \"making medicine,\" that is, consulting the Manitou, to whom\r\nthey hung up offerings, sometimes a dead dog, and sometimes the\r\nbelt-cloth which formed their only garment.\r\n\r\nThe Mission Indians were better allies than these heathen of the west;\r\nand their priests, who followed them to the war, had great influence\r\nover them. They were armed with guns, which they well knew how to use.\r\nTheir dress, though savage, was generally decent, and they were not\r\ncannibals; though in other respects they retained all their traditional\r\nferocity and most of their traditional habits. They held frequent\r\nwar-feasts, one of which is described by Roubaud, Jesuit missionary of\r\nthe Abenakis of St. Francis, whose flock formed a part of the company\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\"Imagine,\" says the father, \"a great assembly of savages adorned with\r\nevery ornament most suited to disfigure them in European eyes, painted\r\nwith vermilion, white, green, yellow, and black made of soot and the\r\nscrapings of pots. A single savage face combines all these different\r\ncolors, methodically laid on with the help of a little tallow, which\r\nserves for pomatum. The head is shaved except at the top, where there is\r\na small tuft, to which are fastened feathers, a few beads of wampum, or\r\nsome such trinket. Every part of the head has its ornament. Pendants\r\nhang from the nose and also from the ears, which are split in infancy\r\nand drawn down by weights till they flap at last against the shoulders.\r\nThe rest of the equipment answers to this fantastic decoration: a shirt\r\nbedaubed with vermilion, wampum collars, silver bracelets, a large knife\r\nhanging on the breast, moose-skin moccasons, and a belt of various\r\ncolors always absurdly combined. The sachems and war-chiefs are\r\ndistinguished from the rest: the latter by a gorget, and the former by a\r\nmedal, with the King's portrait on one side, and on the other Mars and\r\nBellona joining hands, with the device, _Virtues et Honor_.\"\r\n\r\nThus attired, the company sat in two lines facing each other, with\r\nkettles in the middle filled with meat chopped for distribution. To a\r\ndignified silence succeeded songs, sung by several chiefs in succession,\r\nand compared by the narrator to the howling of wolves. Then followed a\r\nspeech from the chief orator, highly commended by Roubaud, who could not\r\nhelp admiring this effort of savage eloquence. \"After the harangue,\" he\r\ncontinues, \"they proceeded to nominate the chiefs who were to take\r\ncommand. As soon as one was named he rose and took the head of some\r\nanimal that had been butchered for the feast. He raised it aloft so that\r\nall the company could see it, and cried: 'Behold the head of the enemy!'\r\nApplause and cries of joy rose from all parts of the assembly. The\r\nchief, with the head in his hand, passed down between the lines, singing\r\nhis war-song, bragging of his exploits, taunting and defying the enemy,\r\nand glorifying himself beyond all measure. To hear his self-laudation in\r\nthese moments of martial transport one would think him a conquering hero\r\nready to sweep everything before him. As he passed in front of the other\r\nsavages, they would respond by dull broken cries jerked up from the\r\ndepths of their stomachs, and accompanied by movements of their bodies\r\nso odd that one must be well used to them to keep countenance. In the\r\ncourse of his song the chief would utter from time to time some\r\ngrotesque witticism; then he would stop, as if pleased with himself, or\r\nrather to listen to the thousand confused cries of applause that greeted\r\nhis ears. He kept up his martial promenade as long as he liked the\r\nsport; and when he had had enough, ended by flinging down the head of\r\nthe animal with an air of contempt, to show that his warlike appetite\r\ncraved meat of another sort.\"[496] Others followed with similar songs\r\nand pantomime, and the festival was closed at last by ladling out the\r\nmeat from the kettles, and devouring it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 496: _Lettre du Père_ ...(Roubaud), _Missionnaire chez les\r\nAbnakis, 21 Oct_. 1757, in _Lettres Edifiantes et Curieuses_, VI. 189\r\n(1810).]\r\n\r\nRoubaud was one day near the fort, when he saw the shore lined with a\r\nthousand Indians, watching four or five English prisoners, who, with the\r\nwar-party that had captured them, were approaching in a boat from the\r\nfarther side of the water. Suddenly the whole savage crew broke away\r\ntogether and ran into the neighboring woods, whence they soon emerged,\r\nyelling diabolically, each armed with a club. The wretched prisoners\r\nwere to be forced to \"run the gauntlet\" which would probably have killed\r\nthem. They were saved by the chief who commanded the war-party, and who,\r\non the persuasion of a French officer, claimed them as his own and\r\nforbade the game; upon which, according to rule in such cases, the rest\r\nabandoned it. On this same day the missionary met troops of Indians\r\nconducting several bands of English prisoners along the road that led\r\nthrough the forest from the camp of Lévis. Each of the captives was held\r\nby a cord made fast about the neck; and the sweat was starting from\r\ntheir brows in the extremity of their horror and distress. Roubaud's\r\ntent was at this time in the camp of the Ottawas. He presently saw a\r\nlarge number of them squatted about a fire, before which meat was\r\nroasting on sticks stuck in the ground; and, approaching, he saw that it\r\nwas the flesh of an Englishman, other parts of which were boiling in a\r\nkettle, while near by sat eight or ten of the prisoners, forced to see\r\ntheir comrade devoured. The horror-stricken priest began to remonstrate;\r\non which a young savage fiercely replied in broken French: \"You have\r\nFrench taste; I have Indian. This is good meat for me;\" and the feasters\r\npressed him to share it.\r\n\r\nBougainville says that this abomination could not be prevented; which\r\nonly means that if force had been used to stop it, the Ottawas would\r\nhave gone home in a rage. They were therefore left to finish their meal\r\nundisturbed. Having eaten one of their prisoners, they began to treat\r\nthe rest with the utmost kindness, bringing them white bread, and\r\nattending to all their wants--a seeming change of heart due to the fact\r\nthat they were a valuable commodity, for which the owners hoped to get a\r\ngood price at Montreal. Montcalm wished to send them thither at once, to\r\nwhich after long debate the Indians consented, demanding, however, a\r\nreceipt in full, and bargaining that the captives should be supplied\r\nwith shoes and blankets.[497]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 497: _Journal de l'Expédition contre le Fort George_ [William\r\nHenry] _du 12 Juillet au 16 Août_, 1757. Bougainville, _Journal. Lettre\r\ndu P. Roubaud_.]\r\n\r\nThese unfortunates belonged to a detachment of three hundred\r\nprovincials, chiefly New Jersey men, sent from Fort William Henry under\r\ncommand of Colonel Parker to reconnoitre the French outposts. Montcalm's\r\nscouts discovered them; on which a band of Indians, considerably more\r\nnumerous, went to meet them under a French partisan named Corbière, and\r\nambushed themselves not far from Sabbath Day Point. Parker had rashly\r\ndivided his force; and at daybreak of the twenty-sixth of July three of\r\nhis boats fell into the snare, and were captured without a shot. Three\r\nothers followed, in ignorance of what had happened, and shared the fate\r\nof the first. When the rest drew near, they were greeted by a deadly\r\nvolley from the thickets, and a swarm of canoes darted out upon them.\r\nThe men were seized with such a panic that some of them jumped into the\r\nwater to escape, while the Indians leaped after them and speared them\r\nwith their lances like fish. \"Terrified,\" says Bougainville, \"by the\r\nsight of these monsters, their agility, their firing, and their yells,\r\nthey surrendered almost without resistance.\" About a hundred, however,\r\nmade their escape. The rest were killed or captured, and three of the\r\nbodies were eaten on the spot. The journalist adds that the victory so\r\nelated the Indians that they became insupportable; \"but here in the\r\nforests of America we can no more do without them than without cavalry\r\non the plain.\"[498]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 498: Bougainville, _Journal_.

A hundred and fifty of them, along with a few Canadians under\r\nMarin, made a dash at Fort Edward, killed or drove in the pickets, and\r\nreturned with thirty-two scalps and a prisoner. It was found, however,\r\nthat the scalps were far from representing an equal number of heads, the\r\nIndians having learned the art of making two or three out of one by\r\njudicious division.[499]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 499: This affair was much exaggerated at the time. I follow\r\nBougainville, who had the facts from Marin. According to him, the\r\nthirty-two scalps represented eleven killed; which exactly answers to\r\nthe English loss as stated by Colonel Frye in a letter from Fort\r\nEdward.]\r\n\r\nPreparations were urged on with the utmost energy. Provisions, camp\r\nequipage, ammunition, cannon, and bateaux were dragged by gangs of men\r\nup the road from the camp of Lévis to the head of the rapids. The work\r\nwent on through heat and rain, by day and night, till, at the end of\r\nJuly, all was done. Now, on the eve of departure, Montcalm, anxious for\r\nharmony among his red allies, called them to a grand council near the\r\ncamp of Rigaud. Forty-one tribes and sub-tribes, Christian and heathen,\r\nfrom the east and from the west, were represented in it. Here were the\r\nmission savages,--Iroquois of Caughnawaga, Two Mountains, and La\r\nPrésentation; Hurons of Lorette and Detroit; Nipissings of Lake\r\nNipissing; Abenakis of St. Francis, Becancour, Missisqui, and the\r\nPenobscot; Algonkins of Three Rivers and Two Mountains; Micmacs and\r\nMalecites from Acadia: in all eight hundred chiefs and warriors. With\r\nthese came the heathen of the west,--Ottawas of seven distinct bands;\r\nOjibwas from Lake Superior, and Mississagas from the region of Lakes\r\nErie and Huron; Pottawattamies and Menomonies from Lake Michigan; Sacs,\r\nFoxes, and Winnebagoes from Wisconsin; Miamis from the prairies of\r\nIllinois, and Iowas from the banks of the Des Moines: nine hundred and\r\nseventy-nine chiefs and warriors, men of the forests and men of the\r\nplains, hunters of the moose and hunters of the buffalo, bearers of\r\nsteel hatchets and stone war-clubs, of French guns and of flint-headed\r\narrows. All sat in silence, decked with ceremonial paint, scalp-locks,\r\neagle plumes, or horns of buffalo; and the dark and wild assemblage was\r\nedged with white uniforms of officers from France, who came in numbers\r\nto the spectacle. Other officers were also here, all belonging to the\r\ncolony. They had been appointed to the command of the Indian allies,\r\nover whom, however, they had little or no real authority. First among\r\nthem was the bold and hardy Saint-Luc de la Corne, who was called\r\ngeneral of the Indians; and under him were others, each assigned to some\r\ntribe or group of tribes,--the intrepid Marin; Charles Langlade, who had\r\nleft his squaw wife at Michillimackinac to join the war; Niverville,\r\nLangis, La Plante, Hertel, Longueuil, Herbin, Lorimier, Sabrevois, and\r\nFleurimont; men familiar from childhood with forests and savages. Each\r\ntribe had its interpreter, often as lawless as those with whom he had\r\nspent his life; and for the converted tribes there were three\r\nmissionaries,--Piquet for the Iroquois, Mathevet for the Nipissings, who\r\nwere half heathen, and Roubaud for the Abenakis.[500]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 500: The above is chiefly from _Tableau des Sauvages qui se\r\ntrouvent à l'Armée du Marquis de Montcalm, le 28 Juillet, 1757_.\r\nForty-one tribes and sub-tribes are here named, some, however,\r\nrepresented by only three or four warriors. Besides those set down under\r\nthe head of Christians, it is stated that a few of the Ottawas of\r\nDetroit and Michillimackinac still retained the faith.]\r\n\r\nThere was some complaint among the Indians because they were crowded\r\nupon by the officers who came as spectators. This difficulty being\r\nremoved, the council opened, Montcalm having already explained his plans\r\nto the chiefs and told them the part he expected them to play.\r\n\r\nPennahouel, chief of the Ottawas, and senior of all the Assembly, rose\r\nand said: \"My father, I, who have counted more moons than any here,\r\nthank you for the good words you have spoken. I approve them. Nobody\r\never spoke better. It is the Manitou of War who inspires you.\"\r\n\r\nKikensick, chief of the Nipissings, rose in behalf of the Christian\r\nIndians, and addressed the heathen of the west. \"Brothers, we thank you\r\nfor coming to help us defend our lands against the English. Our cause is\r\ngood. The Master of Life is on our side. Can you doubt it, brothers,\r\nafter the great blow you have just struck? It covers you with glory. The\r\nlake, red with the blood of Corlaer [_the English_] bears witness\r\nforever to your achievement. We too share your glory, and are proud of\r\nwhat you have done.\" Then, turning to Montcalm: \"We are even more glad\r\nthan you, my father, who have crossed the great water, not for your own\r\nsake, but to obey the great King and defend his children. He has bound\r\nus all together by the most solemn of ties. Let us take care that\r\nnothing shall separate us.\"\r\n\r\nThe various interpreters, each in turn, having explained this speech to\r\nthe Assembly, it was received with ejaculations of applause; and when\r\nthey had ceased, Montcalm spoke as follows: \"Children, I am delighted to\r\nsee you all joined in this good work. So long as you remain one, the\r\nEnglish cannot resist you. The great King has sent me to protect and\r\ndefend you; but above all he has charged me to make you happy and\r\nunconquerable, by establishing among you the union which ought to\r\nprevail among brothers, children of one father, the great Onontio.\" Then\r\nhe held out a prodigious wampum belt of six thousand beads: \"Take this\r\nsacred pledge of his word. The union of the beads of which it is made is\r\nthe sign of your united strength. By it I bind you all together, so that\r\nnone of you can separate from the rest till the English are defeated and\r\ntheir fort destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nPennahouel took up the belt and said: \"Behold, brothers, a circle drawn\r\naround us by the great Onontio. Let none of us go out from it; for so\r\nlong as we keep in it, the Master of Life will help all our\r\nundertakings.\" Other chiefs spoke to the same effect, and the council\r\nclosed in perfect harmony.[501] Its various members bivouacked together\r\nat the camp by the lake, and by their carelessness soon set it on fire;\r\nwhence the place became known as the Burned Camp. Those from the\r\nmissions confessed their sins all day; while their heathen brothers hung\r\nan old coat and a pair of leggings on a pole as tribute to the Manitou.\r\nThis greatly embarrassed the three priests, who were about to say Mass,\r\nbut doubted whether they ought to say it in presence of a sacrifice to\r\nthe devil. Hereupon they took counsel of Montcalm. \"Better say it so\r\nthan not at all,\" replied the military casuist. Brandy being prudently\r\ndenied them, the allies grew restless; and the greater part paddled up\r\nthe lake to a spot near the place where Parker had been defeated. Here\r\nthey encamped to wait the arrival of the army, and amused themselves\r\nmeantime with killing rattlesnakes, there being a populous \"den\" of\r\nthose reptiles among the neighboring rocks.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 501: Bougainville, _Journal_.]\r\n\r\nMontcalm sent a circular letter to the regular officers, urging them to\r\ndispense for a while with luxuries, and even comforts. \"We have but few\r\nbateaux, and these are so filled with stores that a large division of\r\nthe army must go by land;\" and he directed that everything not\r\nabsolutely necessary should be left behind, and that a canvas shelter to\r\nevery two officers should serve them for a tent, and a bearskin for a\r\nbed. \"Yet I do not forbid a mattress,\" he adds. \"Age and infirmities may\r\nmake it necessary to some; but I shall not have one myself, and make no\r\ndoubt that all who can will willingly imitate me.\"[502]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 502: _Circulaire du Marquis de Montcalm, 25 Juillet, 1757._]\r\n\r\nThe bateaux lay ready by the shore, but could not carry the whole force;\r\nand Lévis received orders to march by the side of the lake with\r\ntwenty-five hundred men, Canadians, regulars, and Iroquois. He set out\r\nat daybreak of the thirtieth of July, his men carrying nothing but their\r\nknapsacks, blankets, and weapons. Guided by the unerring Indians, they\r\nclimbed the steep gorge at the side of Rogers Rock, gained the valley\r\nbeyond, and marched southward along a Mohawk trail which threaded the\r\nforest in a course parallel to the lake. The way was of the roughest;\r\nmany straggled from the line, and two officers completely broke down.\r\nThe first destination of the party was the mouth of Ganouskie Bay, now\r\ncalled Northwest Bay, where they were to wait for Montcalm, and kindle\r\nthree fires as a signal that they had reached the rendezvous.[503]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 503: _Guerre du Canada, par le Chevalier de Lévis_. This\r\nmanuscript of Lévis is largely in the nature of a journal.]\r\n\r\nMontcalm left a detachment to hold Ticonderoga; and then, on the first\r\nof August, at two in the afternoon, he embarked at the Burned Camp with\r\nall his remaining force. Including those with Lévis, the expedition\r\ncounted about seven thousand six hundred men, of whom more than sixteen\r\nhundred were Indians.[504] At five in the afternoon they reached the\r\nplace where the Indians, having finished their rattlesnake hunt, were\r\nsmoking their pipes and waiting for the army. The red warriors embarked,\r\nand joined the French flotilla; and now, as evening drew near, was seen\r\none of those wild pageantries of war which Lake George has often\r\nwitnessed. A restless multitude of birch canoes, filled with painted\r\nsavages, glided by shores and islands, like troops of swimming\r\nwater-fowl. Two hundred and fifty bateaux came next, moved by sail and\r\noar, some bearing the Canadian militia, and some the battalions of Old\r\nFrance in trim and gay attire: first, La Reine and Languedoc; then the\r\ncolony regulars; then La Sarre and Guienne; then the Canadian brigade of\r\nCourtemanche; then the cannon and mortars, each on a platform sustained\r\nby two bateaux lashed side by side, and rowed by the militia of\r\nSaint-Ours; then the battalions of Béarn and Royal Roussillon; then the\r\nCanadians of Gaspé, with the provision-bateaux and the field-hospital;\r\nand, lastly, a rear guard of regulars closed the line. So, under the\r\nflush of sunset, they held their course along the romantic lake, to play\r\ntheir part in the historic drama that lends a stern enchantment to its\r\nfascinating scenery. They passed the Narrows in mist and darkness; and\r\nwhen, a little before dawn, they rounded the high promontory of Tongue\r\nMountain, they saw, far on the right, three fiery sparks shining through\r\nthe gloom. These were the signal-fires of Lévis, to tell them that he\r\nhad reached the appointed spot.[505]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 504: _État de l'Armée Française devant le Fort George,\r\nautrement Guillaume-Henri, le 3 Août, 1757. Tableau des Sauvages qui se\r\ntrouvent à l'Armée du Marquis de Montcalm, le 28 Juillet, 1757_. This\r\ngives a total of 1,799 Indians, of whom some afterwards left the army.\r\n_État de l'Armée du Roi en Canada, sur le Lac St. Sacrement et dans les\r\nCamps de Carillon, le 29 Juillet, 1757_. This gives a total of 8,019\r\nmen, of whom about four hundred were left in garrison at Ticonderoga.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 505: The site of the present village of Bolton.]\r\n\r\nLévis had arrived the evening before, after his hard march through the\r\nsultry midsummer forest. His men had now rested for a night, and at ten\r\nin the morning he marched again. Montcalm followed at noon, and coasted\r\nthe western shore, till, towards evening, he found Lévis waiting for him\r\nby the margin of a small bay not far from the English fort, though\r\nhidden from it by a projecting point of land. Canoes and bateaux were\r\ndrawn up on the beach, and the united forces made their bivouac\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe earthen mounds of Fort William Henry still stand by the brink of\r\nLake George; and seated at the sunset of an August day under the pines\r\nthat cover them, one gazes on a scene of soft and soothing beauty, where\r\ndreamy waters reflect the glories of the mountains and the sky. As it\r\nis to-day, so it was then; all breathed repose and peace. The splash of\r\nsome leaping trout, or the dipping wing of a passing swallow, alone\r\ndisturbed the summer calm of that unruffled mirror.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o'clock at night two boats set out from the fort to\r\nreconnoitre. They were passing a point of land on their left, two miles\r\nor more down the lake, when the men on board descried through the gloom\r\na strange object against the bank; and they rowed towards it to learn\r\nwhat it might be. It was an awning over the bateaux that carried Roubaud\r\nand his brother missionaries. As the rash oarsmen drew near, the\r\nbleating of a sheep in one of the French provision-boats warned them of\r\ndanger; and turning, they pulled for their lives towards the eastern\r\nshore. Instantly more than a thousand Indians threw themselves into\r\ntheir canoes and dashed in hot pursuit, making the lake and the\r\nmountains ring with the din of their war-whoops. The fugitives had\r\nnearly reached land when their pursuers opened fire. They replied; shot\r\none Indian dead, and wounded another; then snatched their oars again,\r\nand gained the beach. But the whole savage crew was upon them. Several\r\nwere killed, three were taken, and the rest escaped in the dark\r\nwoods.[506] The prisoners were brought before Montcalm, and gave him\r\nvaluable information of the strength and position of the English.[507]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 506: _Lettre du Père Roubaud, 21 Oct. 1757_. Roubaud, who saw\r\nthe whole, says that twelve hundred Indians joined the chase, and that\r\ntheir yells were terrific.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 507: The remains of Fort William Henry are now--1882--crowded\r\nbetween a hotel and the wharf and station of a railway. While I write, a\r\nscheme is on foot to level the whole for other railway structures. When\r\nI first knew the place the ground was in much the same state as in the\r\ntime of Montcalm.]\r\n\r\nThe Indian who was killed was a noted chief of the Nipissings; and his\r\ntribesmen howled in grief for their bereavement. They painted his face\r\nwith vermilion, tied feathers in his hair, hung pendants in his ears and\r\nnose, clad him in a resplendent war-dress, put silver bracelets on his\r\narms, hung a gorget on his breast with a flame colored ribbon, and\r\nseated him in state on the top of a hillock, with his lance in his hand,\r\nhis gun in the hollow of his arm, his tomahawk in his belt, and his\r\nkettle by his side. Then they all crouched about him in lugubrious\r\nsilence. A funeral harangue followed; and next a song and solemn dance\r\nto the booming of the Indian drum. In the gray of the morning they\r\nburied him as he sat, and placed food in the grave for his journey to\r\nthe land of souls.[508]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 508: _Lettre du Père Roubaud_.]\r\n\r\nAs the sun rose above the eastern mountains the French camp was all\r\nastir. The column of Lévis, with Indians to lead the way, moved through\r\nthe forest towards the fort, and Montcalm followed with the main body;\r\nthen the artillery boats rounded the point that had hid them from the\r\nsight of the English, saluting them as they did so with musketry and\r\ncannon; while a host of savages put out upon the lake, ranged their\r\ncanoes abreast in a line from shore to shore, and advanced slowly, with\r\nmeasured paddle-strokes and yells of defiance.\r\n\r\nThe position of the enemy was full in sight before them. At the head of\r\nthe lake, towards the right, stood the fort, close to the edge of the\r\nwater. On its left was a marsh; then the rough piece of ground where\r\nJohnson had encamped two years before; then a low, flat, rocky hill,\r\ncrowned with an entrenched camp; and, lastly, on the extreme left,\r\nanother marsh. Far around the fort and up the slopes of the western\r\nmountain the forest had been cut down and burned, and the ground was\r\ncumbered with blackened stumps and charred carcasses and limbs of fallen\r\ntrees, strewn in savage disorder one upon another.[509] This was the\r\nwork of Winslow in the autumn before. Distant shouts and war-cries, the\r\nclatter of musketry, white puffs of smoke in the dismal clearing and\r\nalong the scorched edge of the bordering forest, told that Lévis'\r\nIndians were skirmishing with parties of the English, who had gone out\r\nto save the cattle roaming in the neighborhood, and burn some\r\nout-buildings that would have favored the besiegers. Others were taking\r\ndown the tents that stood on a plateau near the foot of the mountain on\r\nthe right, and moving them to the entrenchment on the hill. The garrison\r\nsallied from the fort to support their comrades, and for a time the\r\nfiring was hot.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 509: _Précis des Événements de la Campagne de 1757 en la\r\nNouvelle France._]\r\n\r\nFort William Henry was an irregular bastioned square, formed by\r\nembankments of gravel surmounted by a rampart of heavy logs, laid in\r\ntiers crossed one upon another, the interstices filled with earth. The\r\nlake protected it on the north, the marsh on the east, and ditches with\r\n_chevaux-de-frise_ on the south and west. Seventeen cannon, great and\r\nsmall, besides several mortars and swivels, were mounted upon it;[510]\r\nand a brave Scotch veteran, Lieutenant-Colonel Monro, of the\r\nthirty-fifth regiment, was in command.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 510: _État des Effets et Munitions de Guerre qui se sont\r\ntrouvés au Fort Guillaume-Henri._ There were six more guns in the\r\nentrenched camp.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Webb lay fourteen miles distant at Fort Edward, with twenty-six\r\nhundred men, chiefly provincials. On the twenty-fifth of July he had\r\nmade a visit to Fort William Henry, examined the place, given some\r\norders, and returned on the twenty-ninth. He then wrote to the Governor\r\nof New York, telling him that the French were certainly coming, begging\r\nhim to send up the militia, and saying: \"I am determined to march to\r\nFort William Henry with the whole army under my command as soon as I\r\nshall hear of the farther approach of the enemy.\" Instead of doing so he\r\nwaited three days, and then sent up a detachment of two hundred regulars\r\nunder Lieutenant-Colonel Young, and eight hundred Massachusetts men\r\nunder Colonel Frye. This raised the force at the lake to two thousand\r\nand two hundred, including sailors and mechanics, and reduced that of\r\nWebb to sixteen hundred, besides half as many more distributed at Albany\r\nand the intervening forts.[511] If, according to his spirited intention,\r\nhe should go to the rescue of Monro, he must leave some of his troops\r\nbehind him to protect the lower posts from a possible French inroad by\r\nway of South Bay. Thus his power of aiding Monro was slight, so rashly\r\nhad Loudon, intent on Louisburg, left this frontier open to attack. The\r\ndefect, however, was as much in Webb himself as in his resources. His\r\nconduct in the past year had raised doubts of his personal courage; and\r\nthis was the moment for answering them. Great as was the disparity of\r\nnumbers, the emergency would have justified an attempt to save Monro at\r\nany risk. That officer sent him a hasty note, written at nine o'clock on\r\nthe morning of the third, telling him that the French were in sight on\r\nthe lake; and, in the next night, three rangers came to Fort Edward,\r\nbringing another short note, dated at six in the evening, announcing\r\nthat the firing had begun, and closing with the words: \"I believe you\r\nwill think it proper to send a reinforcement as soon as possible.\" Now,\r\nif ever, was the time to move, before the fort was invested and access\r\ncut off. But Webb lay quiet, sending expresses to New England for help\r\nwhich could not possibly arrive in time. On the next night another note\r\ncame from Monro to say that the French were upon him in great numbers,\r\nwell supplied with artillery, but that the garrison were all in good\r\nspirits. \"I make no doubt,\" wrote the hardpressed officer, \"that you\r\nwill soon send us a reinforcement;\" and again on the same day: \"We are\r\nvery certain that a part of the enemy have got between you and us upon\r\nthe high road, and would therefore be glad (if it meets with your\r\napprobation) the whole army was marched.\"[512] But Webb gave no\r\nsign.[513]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 511: Frye, _Journal of the Attack of Fort William Henry. Webb\r\nto Loudon, 1 Aug. 1757. Ibid., 5 Aug. 1757._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 512: _Copy of four Letters from Lieutenant-Colonel Monro to\r\nMajor-General Webb, enclosed in the General's Letter of the fifth of\r\nAugust to the Earl of Loudon_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 513: \"The number of troops remaining under my Command at this\r\nplace [_Fort Edward_], excluding the Posts on Hudson's River, amounts to\r\nbut sixteen hundred men fit for duty, with which Army, so much inferior\r\nto that of the enemy, I did not think it prudent to pursue my first\r\nintentions of Marching to their Assistance.\" _Webb to Loudon, 5 Aug.\r\n1757._]\r\n\r\nWhen the skirmishing around the fort was over, La Corne, with a body of\r\nIndians, occupied the road that led to Fort Edward, and Lévis encamped\r\nhard by to support him, while Montcalm proceeded to examine the ground\r\nand settle his plan of attack. He made his way to the rear of the\r\nentrenched camp and reconnoitred it, hoping to carry it by assault; but\r\nit had a breastwork of stones and logs, and he thought the attempt too\r\nhazardous. The ground where he stood was that where Dieskau had been\r\ndefeated; and as the fate of his predecessor was not of flattering\r\naugury, he resolved to besiege the fort in form.\r\n\r\nHe chose for the site of his operations the ground now covered by the\r\nvillage of Caldwell. A little to the north of it was a ravine, beyond\r\nwhich he formed his main camp, while Lévis occupied a tract of dry\r\nground beside the marsh, whence he could easily move to intercept\r\nsuccors from Fort Edward on the one hand, or repel a sortie from Fort\r\nWilliam Henry on the other. A brook ran down the ravine and entered the\r\nlake at a small cove protected from the fire of the fort by a point of\r\nland; and at this place, still called Artillery Cove, Montcalm prepared\r\nto debark his cannon and mortars.\r\n\r\nHaving made his preparations, he sent Fontbrune, one of his\r\naides-de-camp, with a letter to Monro. \"I owe it to humanity,\" he wrote,\r\n\"to summon you to surrender. At present I can restrain the savages, and\r\nmake them observe the terms of a capitulation, as I might not have power\r\nto do under other circumstances; and an obstinate defence on your part\r\ncould only retard the capture of the place a few days, and endanger an\r\nunfortunate garrison which cannot be relieved, in consequence of the\r\ndispositions I have made. I demand a decisive answer within an hour.\"\r\nMonro replied that he and his soldiers would defend themselves to the\r\nlast. While the flags of truce were flying, the Indians swarmed over the\r\nfields before the fort; and when they learned the result, an Abenaki\r\nchief shouted in broken French: \"You won't surrender, eh! Fire away\r\nthen, and fight your best; for if I catch you, you shall get no\r\nquarter.\" Monro emphasized his refusal by a general discharge of his\r\ncannon.\r\n\r\nThe trenches were opened on the night of the fourth,--a task of extreme\r\ndifficulty, as the ground was covered by a profusion of half-burned\r\nstumps, roots, branches, and fallen trunks. Eight hundred men toiled\r\ntill daylight with pick, spade, and axe, while the cannon from the fort\r\nflashed through the darkness, and grape and round-shot whistled and\r\nscreamed over their heads. Some of the English balls reached the camp\r\nbeyond the ravine, and disturbed the slumbers of the officers off duty,\r\nas they lay wrapped in their blankets and bear-skins. Before daybreak\r\nthe first parallel was made; a battery was nearly finished on the left,\r\nand another was begun on the right. The men now worked under cover, safe\r\nin their burrows; one gang relieved another, and the work went on all\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were far from doing what was expected of them. Instead of\r\nscouting in the direction of Fort Edward to learn the movements of the\r\nenemy and prevent surprise, they loitered about the camp and in the\r\ntrenches, or amused themselves by firing at the fort from behind stumps\r\nand logs. Some, in imitation of the French, dug little trenches for\r\nthemselves, in which they wormed their way towards the rampart, and now\r\nand then picked off an artillery-man, not without loss on their own\r\nside. On the afternoon of the fifth, Montcalm invited them to a council,\r\ngave them belts of wampum, and mildly remonstrated with them. \"Why\r\nexpose yourselves without necessity? I grieve bitterly over the losses\r\nthat you have met, for the least among you is precious to me. No doubt\r\nit is a good thing to annoy the English; but that is not the main point.\r\nYou ought to inform me of everything the enemy is doing, and always\r\nkeep parties on the road between the two forts.\" And he gently hinted\r\nthat their place was not in his camp, but in that of Lévis, where\r\nmissionaries were provided for such of them as were Christians, and food\r\nand ammunition for them all. They promised, with excellent docility, to\r\ndo everything he wished, but added that there was something on their\r\nhearts. Being encouraged to relieve themselves of the burden, they\r\ncomplained that they had not been consulted as to the management of the\r\nsiege, but were expected to obey orders like slaves. \"We know more about\r\nfighting in the woods than you,\" said their orator; \"ask our advice, and\r\nyou will be the better for it.\"[514]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 514: Bougainville, _Journal_.]\r\n\r\nMontcalm assured them that if they had been neglected, it was only\r\nthrough the hurry and confusion of the time; expressed high appreciation\r\nof their talents for bush-fighting, promised them ample satisfaction,\r\nand ended by telling them that in the morning they should hear the big\r\nguns. This greatly pleased them, for they were extremely impatient for\r\nthe artillery to begin. About sunrise the battery of the left opened\r\nwith eight heavy cannon and a mortar, joined, on the next morning, by\r\nthe battery of the right, with eleven pieces more. The fort replied with\r\nspirit. The cannon thundered all day, and from a hundred peaks and crags\r\nthe astonished wilderness roared back the sound. The Indians were\r\ndelighted. They wanted to point the guns; and to humor them, they were\r\nnow and then allowed to do so. Others lay behind logs and fallen trees,\r\nand yelled their satisfaction when they saw the splinters fly from the\r\nwooden rampart.\r\n\r\nDay after day the weary roar of the distant cannonade fell on the ears\r\nof Webb in his camp at Fort Edward. \"I have not yet received the least\r\nreinforcement,\" he writes to Loudon; \"this is the disagreeable situation\r\nwe are at present in. The fort, by the heavy firing we hear from the\r\nlake, is still in our possession; but I fear it cannot long hold out\r\nagainst so warm a cannonading if I am not reinforced by a sufficient\r\nnumber of militia to march to their relief.\" The militia were coming;\r\nbut it was impossible that many could reach him in less than a week.\r\nThose from New York alone were within call, and two thousand of them\r\narrived soon after he sent Loudon the above letter. Then, by stripping\r\nall the forts below, he could bring together forty-five hundred men;\r\nwhile several French deserters assured him that Montcalm had nearly\r\ntwelve thousand. To advance to the relief of Monro with a force so\r\ninferior, through a defile of rocks, forests, and mountains, made by\r\nnature for ambuscades,--and this too with troops who had neither the\r\nsteadiness of regulars nor the bush-fighting skill of Indians,--was an\r\nenterprise for firmer nerve than his.\r\n\r\nHe had already warned Monro to expect no help from him. At midnight of\r\nthe fourth, Captain Bartman, his aide-de-camp, wrote: \"The General has\r\nordered me to acquaint you he does not think it prudent to attempt a\r\njunction or to assist you till reinforced by the militia of the\r\ncolonies, for the immediate march of which repeated expresses have been\r\nsent.\" The letter then declared that the French were in complete\r\npossession of the road between the two forts, that a prisoner just\r\nbrought in reported their force in men and cannon to be very great, and\r\nthat, unless the militia came soon, Monro had better make what terms he\r\ncould with the enemy.[515]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 515: Frye, in his _Journal_, gives the letter in full. A\r\nspurious translation of it is appended to a piece called _Jugement\r\nimpartial sur les Opérations militaires en Canada_.]\r\n\r\nThe chance was small that this letter would reach its destination; and\r\nin fact the bearer was killed by La Corne's Indians, who, in stripping\r\nthe body, found the hidden paper, and carried it to the General.\r\nMontcalm kept it several days, till the English rampart was half\r\nbattered down; and then, after saluting his enemy with a volley from all\r\nhis cannon, he sent it with a graceful compliment to Monro. It was\r\nBougainville who carried it, preceded by a drummer and a flag. He was\r\nmet at the foot of the glacis, blindfolded, and led through the fort and\r\nalong the edge of the lake to the entrenched camp, where Monro was at\r\nthe time. \"He returned many thanks,\" writes the emissary in his Diary,\r\n\"for the courtesy of our nation, and protested his joy at having to do\r\nwith so generous an enemy. This was his answer to the Marquis de\r\nMontcalm. Then they led me back, always with eyes blinded; and our\r\nbatteries began to fire again as soon as we thought that the English\r\ngrenadiers who escorted me had had time to re-enter the fort. I hope\r\nGeneral Webb's letter may induce the English to surrender the\r\nsooner.\"[516]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 516: Bougainville, _Journal. Bougainville au Ministre, 19\r\nAoût, 1757._]\r\n\r\nBy this time the sappers had worked their way to the angle of the lake,\r\nwhere they were stopped by a marshy hollow, beyond which was a tract of\r\nhigh ground, reaching to the fort and serving as the garden of the\r\ngarrison.[517] Logs and fascines in large quantities were thrown into\r\nthe hollow, and hurdles were laid over them to form a causeway for the\r\ncannon. Then the sap was continued up the acclivity beyond, a trench was\r\nopened in the garden, and a battery begun, not two hundred and fifty\r\nyards from the fort. The Indians, in great number, crawled forward among\r\nthe beans, maize, and cabbages, and lay there ensconced. On the night of\r\nthe seventh, two men came out of the fort, apparently to reconnoitre,\r\nwith a view to a sortie, when they were greeted by a general volley and\r\na burst of yells which echoed among the mountains; followed by\r\nresponsive whoops pealing through the darkness from the various camps\r\nand lurking-places of the savage warriors far and near.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 517: Now (1882) the site of Fort William Henry Hotel, with its\r\ngrounds. The hollow is partly filled by the main road of Caldwell.]\r\n\r\nThe position of the besieged was now deplorable. More than three hundred\r\nof them had been killed and wounded; small-pox was raging in the fort;\r\nthe place was a focus of infection, and the casemates were crowded with\r\nthe sick. A sortie from the entrenched camp and another from the fort\r\nhad been repulsed with loss. All their large cannon and mortars had been\r\nburst, or disabled by shot; only seven small pieces were left fit for\r\nservice;[518] and the whole of Montcalm's thirty-one cannon and fifteen\r\nmortars and howitzers would soon open fire, while the walls were already\r\nbreached, and an assault was imminent. Through the night of the eighth\r\nthey fired briskly from all their remaining pieces. In the morning the\r\nofficers held a council, and all agreed to surrender if honorable terms\r\ncould be had. A white flag was raised, a drum was beat, and\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Young, mounted on horseback, for a shot in the foot\r\nhad disabled him from walking, went, followed by a few soldiers, to the\r\ntent of Montcalm.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 518: Frye, _Journal_.]\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that the English troops should march out with the honors\r\nof war, and be escorted to Fort Edward by a detachment of French troops;\r\nthat they should not serve for eighteen months; and that all French\r\nprisoners captured in America since the war began should be given up\r\nwithin three months. The stores, munitions, and artillery were to be the\r\nprize of the victors, except one field-piece, which the garrison were to\r\nretain in recognition of their brave defence.\r\n\r\nBefore signing the capitulation Montcalm called the Indian chiefs to\r\ncouncil, and asked them to consent to the conditions, and promise to\r\nrestrain their young warriors from any disorder. They approved\r\neverything and promised everything. The garrison then evacuated the\r\nfort, and marched to join their comrades in the entrenched camp, which\r\nwas included in the surrender. No sooner were they gone than a crowd of\r\nIndians clambered through the embrasures in search of rum and plunder.\r\nAll the sick men unable to leave their beds were instantly\r\nbutchered.[519] \"I was witness of this spectacle,\" says the missionary\r\nRoubaud; \"I saw one of these barbarians come out of the casemates with a\r\nhuman head in his hand, from which the blood ran in streams, and which\r\nhe paraded as if he had got the finest prize in the world.\" There was\r\nlittle left to plunder; and the Indians, joined by the more lawless of\r\nthe Canadians, turned their attention to the entrenched camp, where all\r\nthe English were now collected.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 519: _Attestation of William Arbuthnot, Captain in Frye's\r\nRegiment._]\r\n\r\nThe French guard stationed there could not or would not keep out the\r\nrabble. By the advice of Montcalm the English stove their rum-barrels;\r\nbut the Indians were drunk already with homicidal rage, and the glitter\r\nof their vicious eyes told of the devil within. They roamed among the\r\ntents, intrusive, insolent, their visages besmirched with war-paint;\r\ngrinning like fiends as they handled, in anticipation of the knife, the\r\nlong hair of cowering women, of whom, as well as of children, there were\r\nmany in the camp, all crazed with fright. Since the last war the New\r\nEngland border population had regarded Indians with a mixture of\r\ndetestation and horror. Their mysterious warfare of ambush and surprise,\r\ntheir midnight onslaughts, their butcheries, their burnings, and all\r\ntheir nameless atrocities, had been for years the theme of fireside\r\nstory; and the dread they excited was deepened by the distrust and\r\ndejection of the time. The confusion in the camp lasted through the\r\nafternoon. \"The Indians,\" says Bougainville, \"wanted to plunder the\r\nchests of the English; the latter resisted; and there was fear that\r\nserious disorder would ensue. The Marquis de Montcalm ran thither\r\nimmediately, and used every means to restore tranquillity: prayers,\r\nthreats, caresses, interposition of the officers and interpreters who\r\nhave some influence over these savages.\"[520] \"We shall be but too happy\r\nif we can prevent a massacre. Detestable position! of which nobody who\r\nhas not been in it can have any idea, and which makes victory itself a\r\nsorrow to the victors. The Marquis spared no efforts to prevent the\r\nrapacity of the savages and, I must say it, of certain persons\r\nassociated with them, from resulting in something worse than plunder.\r\nAt last, at nine o'clock in the evening, order seemed restored. The\r\nMarquis even induced the Indians to promise that, besides the escort\r\nagreed upon in the capitulation, two chiefs for each tribe should\r\naccompany the English on their way to Fort Edward.\"[521] He also ordered\r\nLa Corne and the other Canadian officers attached to the Indians to see\r\nthat no violence took place. He might well have done more. In view of\r\nthe disorders of the afternoon, it would not have been too much if he\r\nhad ordered the whole body of regular troops, whom alone he could trust\r\nfor the purpose, to hold themselves ready to move to the spot in case of\r\noutbreak, and shelter their defeated foes behind a hedge of bayonets.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 520: _Bougainville au Ministre, 19 Août, 1757._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 521: Bougainville, _Journal_.]\r\n\r\nBougainville was not to see what ensued; for Montcalm now sent him to\r\nMontreal, as a special messenger to carry news of the victory. He\r\nembarked at ten o'clock. Returning daylight found him far down the lake;\r\nand as he looked on its still bosom flecked with mists, and its quiet\r\nmountains sleeping under the flush of dawn, there was nothing in the\r\nwild tranquillity of the scene to suggest the tragedy which even then\r\nwas beginning on the shore he had left behind.\r\n\r\nThe English in their camp had passed a troubled night, agitated by\r\nstrange rumors. In the morning something like a panic seized them; for\r\nthey distrusted not the Indians only, but the Canadians. In their haste\r\nto be gone they got together at daybreak, before the escort of three\r\nhundred regulars had arrived. They had their muskets, but no ammunition;\r\nand few or none of the provincials had bayonets. Early as it was, the\r\nIndians were on the alert; and, indeed, since midnight great numbers of\r\nthem had been prowling about the skirts of the camp, showing, says\r\nColonel Frye, \"more than usual malice in their looks.\" Seventeen wounded\r\nmen of his regiment lay in huts, unable to join the march. In the\r\npreceding afternoon Miles Whitworth, the regimental surgeon, had passed\r\nthem over to the care of a French surgeon, according to an agreement\r\nmade at the time of the surrender; but, the Frenchman being absent, the\r\nother remained with them attending to their wants. The French surgeon\r\nhad caused special sentinels to be posted for their protection. These\r\nwere now removed, at the moment when they were needed most; upon which,\r\nabout five o'clock in the morning, the Indians entered the huts,\r\ndragged out the inmates, and tomahawked and scalped them all, before the\r\neyes of Whitworth, and in presence of La Corne and other Canadian\r\nofficers, as well as of a French guard stationed within forty feet of\r\nthe spot; and, declares the surgeon under oath, \"none, either officer or\r\nsoldier, protected the said wounded men.\"[522] The opportune butchery\r\nrelieved them of a troublesome burden.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 522: _Affidavit of Miles Whitworth_. See Appendix F.]\r\n\r\nA scene of plundering now began. The escort had by this time arrived,\r\nand Monro complained to the officers that the capitulation was broken;\r\nbut got no other answer than advice to give up the baggage to the\r\nIndians in order to appease them. To this the English at length agreed;\r\nbut it only increased the excitement of the mob. They demanded rum; and\r\nsome of the soldiers, afraid to refuse, gave it to them from their\r\ncanteens, thus adding fuel to the flame. When, after much difficulty,\r\nthe column at last got out of the camp and began to move along the road\r\nthat crossed the rough plain between the entrenchment and the forest,\r\nthe Indians crowded upon them, impeded their march, snatched caps,\r\ncoats, and weapons from men and officers, tomahawked those that\r\nresisted, and, seizing upon shrieking women and children, dragged them\r\noff or murdered them on the spot. It is said that some of the\r\ninterpreters secretly fomented the disorder.[523] Suddenly there rose\r\nthe screech of the war-whoop. At this signal of butchery, which was\r\ngiven by Abenaki Christians from the mission of the Penobscot,[524] a\r\nmob of savages rushed upon the New Hampshire men at the rear of the\r\ncolumn, and killed or dragged away eighty of them.[525] A frightful\r\ntumult ensued, when Montcalm, Lévis, Bourlamaque, and many other French\r\nofficers, who had hastened from their camp on the first news of\r\ndisturbance, threw themselves among the Indians, and by promises and\r\nthreats tried to allay their frenzy. \"Kill me, but spare the English who\r\nare under my protection,\" exclaimed Montcalm. He took from one of them a\r\nyoung officer whom the savage had seized; upon which several other\r\nIndians immediately tomahawked their prisoners, lest they too should be\r\ntaken from them. One writer says that a French grenadier was killed and\r\ntwo wounded in attempting to restore order; but the statement is\r\ndoubtful. The English seemed paralyzed, and fortunately did not attempt\r\na resistance, which, without ammunition as they were, would have ended\r\nin a general massacre. Their broken column straggled forward in wild\r\ndisorder, amid the din of whoops and shrieks, till they reached the\r\nFrench advance-guard, which consisted of Canadians; and here they\r\ndemanded protection from the officers, who refused to give it, telling\r\nthem that they must take to the woods and shift for themselves. Frye was\r\nseized by a number of Indians, who, brandishing spears and tomahawks,\r\nthreatened him with death and tore off his clothing, leaving nothing but\r\nbreeches, shoes, and shirt. Repelled by the officers of the guard, he\r\nmade for the woods. A Connecticut soldier who was present says of him\r\nthat he leaped upon an Indian who stood in his way, disarmed and killed\r\nhim, and then escaped; but Frye himself does not mention the incident.\r\nCaptain Burke, also of the Massachusetts regiment, was stripped, after a\r\nviolent struggle, of all his clothes; then broke loose, gained the\r\nwoods, spent the night shivering in the thick grass of a marsh, and on\r\nthe next day reached Fort Edward. Jonathan Carver, a provincial\r\nvolunteer, declares that, when the tumult was at its height, he saw\r\nofficers of the French army walking about at a little distance and\r\ntalking with seeming unconcern. Three or four Indians seized him,\r\nbrandished their tomahawks over his head, and tore off most of his\r\nclothes, while he vainly claimed protection from a sentinel, who called\r\nhim an English dog, and violently pushed him back among his tormentors.\r\nTwo of them were dragging him towards the neighboring swamp, when an\r\nEnglish officer, stripped of everything but his scarlet breeches, ran\r\nby. One of Carver's captors sprang upon him, but was thrown to the\r\nground; whereupon the other went to the aid of his comrade and drove his\r\ntomahawk into the back of the Englishman. As Carver turned to run, an\r\nEnglish boy, about twelve years old, clung to him and begged for help.\r\nThey ran on together for a moment, when the boy was seized, dragged from\r\nhis protector, and, as Carver judged by his shrieks, was murdered. He\r\nhimself escaped to the forest, and after three days of famine reached\r\nFort Edward.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 523: This is stated by Pouchot and Bougainville; the latter of\r\nwhom confirms the testimony of the English witnesses, that Canadian\r\nofficers present did nothing to check the Indians.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 524: See note, end of chapter.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 525: Belknap, _History of New Hampshire_, says that eighty\r\nwere killed. Governor Wentworth, writing immediately after the event,\r\nsays \"killed or captivated.\"]\r\n\r\nThe bonds of discipline seem for the time to have been completely\r\nbroken; for while Montcalm and his chief officers used every effort to\r\nrestore order, even at the risk of their lives, many other officers,\r\nchiefly of the militia, failed atrociously to do their duty. How many\r\nEnglish were killed it is impossible to tell with exactness. Roubaud\r\nsays that he saw forty or fifty corpses scattered about the field. Lévis\r\nsays fifty; which does not include the sick and wounded before murdered\r\nin the camp and fort. It is certain that six or seven hundred persons\r\nwere carried off, stripped, and otherwise maltreated. Montcalm succeeded\r\nin recovering more than four hundred of them in the course of the day;\r\nand many of the French officers did what they could to relieve their\r\nwants by buying back from their captors the clothing that had been torn\r\nfrom them. Many of the fugitives had taken refuge in the fort, whither\r\nMonro himself had gone to demand protection for his followers; and here\r\nRoubaud presently found a crowd of half-frenzied women, crying in\r\nanguish for husbands and children. All the refugees and redeemed\r\nprisoners were afterwards conducted to the entrenched camp, where food\r\nand shelter were provided for them and a strong guard set for their\r\nprotection until the fifteenth, when they were sent under an escort to\r\nFort Edward. Here cannon had been fired at intervals to guide those who\r\nhad fled to the woods, whence they came dropping in from day to day,\r\nhalf dead with famine.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after the massacre the Indians decamped in a body and set\r\nout for Montreal, carrying with them their plunder and some two hundred\r\nprisoners, who, it is said, could not be got out of their hands. The\r\nsoldiers were set to the work of demolishing the English fort; and the\r\ntask occupied several days. The barracks were torn down, and the huge\r\npine-logs of the rampart thrown into a heap. The dead bodies that filled\r\nthe casemates were added to the mass, and fire was set to the whole. The\r\nmighty funeral pyre blazed all night. Then, on the sixteenth, the army\r\nreimbarked. The din of ten thousand combatants, the rage, the terror,\r\nthe agony, were gone; and no living thing was left but the wolves that\r\ngathered from the mountains to feast upon the dead.[526]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 526: The foregoing chapter rests largely on evidence never\r\nbefore brought to light, including the minute _Journal_ of\r\nBougainville,--document which can hardly be commended too much,--the\r\ncorrespondence of Webb, a letter of Colonel Frye, written just after the\r\nmassacre, and a journal of the siege, sent by him to Governor Pownall as\r\nhis official report. Extracts from these, as well as from the affidavit\r\nof Dr. Whitworth, which is also new evidence, are given in Appendix F.\r\n\r\nThe Diary of Malartic and the correspondence of Montcalm, Lévis,\r\nVaudreuil, and Bigot, also throw light on the campaign, as well as\r\nnumerous reports of the siege, official and semi-official. The long\r\nletter of the Jesuit Roubaud, printed anonymously in the _Lettres\r\nÉdifiantes et Curieuses_, gives a remarkably vivid account of what he\r\nsaw. He was an intelligent person, who may be trusted where he has no\r\nmotive for lying. Curious particulars about him will be found in a paper\r\ncalled, _The deplorable Case of Mr. Roubaud_, printed in the _Historical\r\nMagazine, Second Series_, VIII. 282. Compare Verreau, _Report on\r\nCanadian Archives_, 1874.\r\n\r\nImpressions of the massacre at Fort William Henry have hitherto been\r\nderived chiefly from the narrative of Captain Jonathan Carver, in his\r\n_Travels_. He has discredited himself by his exaggeration of the number\r\nkilled; but his account of what he himself saw tallies with that of the\r\nother witnesses. He is outdone in exaggeration by an anonymous French\r\nwriter of the time, who seems rather pleased at the occurrence, and\r\naffirms that all the English were killed except seven hundred, these\r\nlast being captured, so that none escaped (_Nouvelles du Canada envoyées\r\nde Montréal, Août_, 1757). Carver puts killed and captured together at\r\nfifteen hundred. Vaudreuil, who always makes light of Indian\r\nbarbarities, goes to the other extreme, and avers that no more than five\r\nor six were killed. Lévis and Roubaud, who saw everything, and were\r\ncertain not to exaggerate the number, give the most trustworthy evidence\r\non this point. The capitulation, having been broken by the allies of\r\nFrance, was declared void by the British Government.\r\n\r\n_The Signal of Butchery_. Montcalm, Bougainville, and several others say\r\nthat the massacre was begun by the Abenakis of Panaouski. Father Martin,\r\nin quoting the letter in which Montcalm makes this statement, inserts\r\nthe word _idolâtres_, which is not in the original. Dussieux and\r\nO'Callaghan give the passage correctly. This Abenaki band, ancestors of\r\nthe present Penobscots, were no idolaters, but had been converted more\r\nthan half a century. In the official list of the Indian allies they are\r\nset down among the Christians. Roubaud, who had charge of them during\r\nthe expedition, speaks of these and other converts with singular candor:\r\n\"Vous avez dû vous apercevoir ... que nos sauvages, pour être Chrétiens,\r\nn'en sont pas plus irrépréhensibles dans leur conduite.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 16\r\n\r\n1757, 1758\r\n\r\nA Winter of Discontent\r\n\r\n\r\nLoudon, on his way back from Halifax, was at sea off the coast of Nova\r\nScotia when a despatch-boat from Governor Pownall of Massachusetts\r\nstartled him with news that Fort William Henry was attacked; and a few\r\ndays after he learned by another boat that the fort was taken and the\r\ncapitulation \"inhumanly and villanously broken.\" On this he sent Webb\r\norders to hold the enemy in check without risking a battle till he\r\nshould himself arrive. \"I am on the way,\" these were his words, \"with a\r\nforce sufficient to turn the scale, with God's assistance; and then I\r\nhope we shall teach the French to comply with the laws of nature and\r\nhumanity. For although I abhor barbarity, the knowledge I have of Mr.\r\nVaudreuil's behavior when in Louisiana, from his own letters in my\r\npossession, and the murders committed at Oswego and now at Fort William\r\nHenry, will oblige me to make those gentlemen sick of such inhuman\r\nvillany whenever it is in my power.\" He reached New York on the last day\r\nof August, and heard that the French had withdrawn. He nevertheless sent\r\nhis troops up the Hudson, thinking, he says, that he might still attack\r\nTiconderoga; a wild scheme, which he soon abandoned, if he ever\r\nseriously entertained it.[527]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 527: _Loudon to Webb, 20 Aug. 1757. London to Holdernesse,\r\nOct. 1757. Loudon to Pownall, 16_ [_18?_] _Aug. 1757_. A passage in this\r\nlast letter, in which Loudon says that he shall, if prevented by\r\nhead-winds from getting into New York, disembark the troops on Long\r\nIsland, is perverted by that ardent partisan, William Smith, the\r\nhistorian of New York, into the absurd declaration \"that he should\r\nencamp on Long Island for the defence of the continent.\"]\r\n\r\nWebb had remained at Fort Edward in mortal dread of attack. Johnson had\r\njoined him with a band of Mohawks; and on the day when Fort William\r\nHenry surrendered there had been some talk of attempting to throw\r\nsuccors into it by night. Then came the news of its capture; and now,\r\nwhen it was too late, tumultuous mobs of militia came pouring in from\r\nthe neighboring provinces. In a few days thousands of them were\r\nbivouacked on the fields about Fort Edward, doing nothing, disgusted\r\nand mutinous, declaring that they were ready to fight, but not to lie\r\nstill without tents, blankets, or kettles. Webb writes on the fourteenth\r\nthat most of those from New York had deserted, threatening to kill their\r\nofficers if they tried to stop them. Delancey ordered them to be fired\r\nupon. A sergeant was shot, others were put in arrest, and all was\r\ndisorder till the seventeenth; when Webb, learning that the French were\r\ngone, sent them back to their homes.[528]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 528: _Delancey to_ [_Holdernesse?_], _24 Aug. 1757._]\r\n\r\nClose on the fall of Fort William Henry came crazy rumors of disaster,\r\nrunning like wildfire through the colonies. The number and ferocity of\r\nthe enemy were grossly exaggerated; there was a cry that they would\r\nseize Albany and New York itself;[529] while it was reported that Webb,\r\nas much frightened as the rest, was for retreating to the Highlands of\r\nthe Hudson.[530] This was the day after the capitulation, when a part\r\nonly of the militia had yet appeared. If Montcalm had seized the moment,\r\nand marched that afternoon to Fort Edward, it is not impossible that in\r\nthe confusion he might have carried it by a _coup-de-main._\r\n\r\n[Footnote 529: _Captain Christie to Governor Wentworth, 11 Aug. 1757.\r\nIbid., to Governor Pownall, same date._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 530: Smith, _Hist. N.Y._, Part II. 254.]\r\n\r\nHere was an opportunity for Vaudreuil, and he did not fail to use it.\r\nJealous of his rival's exploit, he spared no pains to tarnish it;\r\ncomplaining that Montcalm had stopped half way on the road to success,\r\nand, instead of following his instructions, had contented himself with\r\none victory when he should have gained two. But the Governor had\r\nenjoined upon him as a matter of the last necessity that the Canadians\r\nshould be at their homes before September to gather the crops, and he\r\nwould have been the first to complain had the injunction been\r\ndisregarded. To besiege Fort Edward was impossible, as Montcalm had no\r\nmeans of transporting cannon thither; and to attack Webb without them\r\nwas a risk which he had not the rashness to incur.\r\n\r\nIt was Bougainville who first brought Vaudreuil the news of the success\r\non Lake George. A day or two after his arrival, the Indians, who had\r\nleft the army after the massacre, appeared at Montreal, bringing about\r\ntwo hundred English prisoners. The Governor rebuked them for breaking\r\nthe capitulation, on which the heathen savages of the West declared that\r\nit was not their fault, but that of the converted Indians, who, in\r\nfact, had first raised the war-whoop. Some of the prisoners were\r\npresently bought from them at the price of two kegs of brandy each; and\r\nthe inevitable consequences followed.\r\n\r\n\"I thought,\" writes Bougainville, \"that the Governor would have told\r\nthem they should have neither provisions nor presents till all the\r\nEnglish were given up; that he himself would have gone to their huts and\r\ntaken the prisoners from them; and that the inhabitants would be\r\nforbidden, under the severest penalties, from selling or giving them\r\nbrandy. I saw the contrary; and my soul shuddered at the sights my eyes\r\nbeheld. On the fifteenth, at two o'clock, in the presence of the whole\r\ntown, they killed one of the prisoners, put him into the kettle, and\r\nforced his wretched countrymen to eat of him.\" The Intendant Bigot, the\r\nfriend of the Governor, confirms this story; and another French writer\r\nsays that they \"compelled mothers to eat the flesh of their\r\nchildren.\"[531] Bigot declares that guns, canoes, and other presents\r\nwere given to the Western tribes before they left Montreal; and he adds,\r\n\"they must be sent home satisfied at any cost.\" Such were the pains\r\ntaken to preserve allies who were useful chiefly through the terror\r\ninspired by their diabolical cruelties. This time their ferocity cost\r\nthem dear. They had dug up and scalped the corpses in the graveyard of\r\nFort William Henry, many of which were remains of victims of the\r\nsmall-pox; and the savages caught the disease, which is said to have\r\nmade great havoc among them.[532]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 531: \"En chemin faisant et même en entrant à Montréal ils les\r\nont mangés et fait manger aux autres prisonniers.\" _Bigot au Ministre,\r\n24 Août, 1757._\r\n\r\n\"Des sauvages out fait manger aux mères la chair de leurs enfants.\"\r\n_Jugement impartial sur les Opérations militaires en Canada_. A French\r\ndiary kept in Canada at this time, and captured at sea, is cited by\r\nHutchinson as containing similar statements.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 532: One of these corpses was that of Richard Rogers, brother\r\nof the noted partisan Robert Rogers. He had died of small-pox some time\r\nbefore. Rogers, _Journals_, 55, _note_.]\r\n\r\nVaudreuil, in reporting what he calls \"my capture of Fort William\r\nHenry,\" takes great credit to himself for his \"generous procedures\"\r\ntowards the English prisoners; alluding, it seems, to his having bought\r\nsome of them from the Indians with the brandy which was sure to cause\r\nthe murder of others.[533] His obsequiousness to his red allies did not\r\ncease with permitting them to kill and devour before his eyes those whom\r\nhe was bound in honor and duty to protect. \"He let them do what they\r\npleased,\" says a French contemporary; \"they were seen roaming about\r\nMontreal, knife in hand, threatening everybody, and often insulting\r\nthose they met. When complaint was made, he said nothing. Far from it;\r\ninstead of reproaching them, he loaded them with gifts, in the belief\r\nthat their cruelty would then relent.\"[534]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 533: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 15 Sept. 1757._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 534: _Mémoires sur le Canada, 1749-1760._]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in about a fortnight all, or nearly all, the surviving\r\nprisoners were bought out of their clutches; and then, after a final\r\ndistribution of presents and a grand debauch at La Chine, the whole\r\nsavage rout paddled for their villages.\r\n\r\nThe campaign closed in November with a partisan exploit on the Mohawk.\r\nHere, at a place called German Flats, on the farthest frontier, there\r\nwas a thriving settlement of German peasants from the Palatinate, who\r\nwere so ill-disposed towards the English that Vaudreuil had had good\r\nhope of stirring them to revolt, while at the same time persuading their\r\nneighbors, the Oneida Indians, to take part with France.[535] As his\r\nmeasures to this end failed, he resolved to attack them. Therefore, at\r\nthree o'clock in the morning of the twelfth of November, three hundred\r\ncolony troops, Canadians and Indians, under an officer named Belêtre,\r\nwakened the unhappy peasants by a burst of yells, and attacked the small\r\npicket forts which they had built as places of refuge. These were taken\r\none by one and set on fire. The sixty dwellings of the settlement, with\r\ntheir barns and outhouses, were all burned, forty or fifty of the\r\ninhabitants were killed, and about three times that number, chiefly\r\nwomen and children, were made prisoners, including Johan Jost Petrie,\r\nthe magistrate of the place. Fort Herkimer was not far off, with a\r\ngarrison of two hundred men under Captain Townshend, who at the first\r\nalarm sent out a detachment too weak to arrest the havoc; while Belêtre,\r\nunable to carry off his booty, set on his followers to the work of\r\ndestruction, killed a great number of hogs, sheep, cattle, and horses,\r\nand then made a hasty retreat. Lord Howe, pushing up the river from\r\nSchenectady with troops and militia, found nothing but an abandoned\r\nslaughter-field. Vaudreuil reported the affair to the Court, and summed\r\nup the results with pompous egotism: \"I have ruined the plans of the\r\nEnglish; I have disposed the Five Nations to attack them; I have carried\r\nconsternation and terror into all those parts.\"[536]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 535: _Dépêches de Vaudreuil, 1757._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 536: _Loudon to Pitt, 14 Feb. 1758. Vaudreuil au Ministre, 12\r\nFév. 1758. Ibid., 28 Nov. 1758._ Bougainville, _Journal. Summary of M.\r\nde Belêtre's Campaign_, in _N.Y. Col. Docs._, X. 672. Extravagant\r\nreports of the havoc made were sent to France. It was pretended that\r\nthree thousand cattle, three thousand sheep (Vaudreuil says four\r\nthousand), and from five hundred to fifteen hundred horses were\r\ndestroyed, with other personal property to the amount of 1,500,000\r\nlivres. These official falsehoods are contradicted in a letter from\r\nQuebec, _Daine au Maréchal de Belleisle, 19 Mai, 1758_. Levis says that\r\nthe whole population of the settlement, men, women, and children, was\r\nnot above three hundred.]\r\n\r\nMontcalm, his summer work over, went to Montreal; and thence in\r\nSeptember to Quebec, a place more to his liking. \"Come as soon as you\r\ncan,\" he wrote to Bourlamaque, \"and I will tell a certain fair lady how\r\neager you are.\" Even Quebec was no paradise for him; and he writes again\r\nto the same friend: \"My heart and my stomach are both ill at ease, the\r\nlatter being the worse.\" To his wife he says: \"The price of everything\r\nis rising. I am ruining myself; I owe the treasurer twelve thousand\r\nfrancs. I long for peace and for you. In spite of the public distress,\r\nwe have balls and furious gambling.\" In February he returned to Montreal\r\nin a sleigh on the ice of the St. Lawrence,--a mode of travelling which\r\nhe describes as cold but delicious. Montreal pleased him less than ever,\r\nespecially as he was not in favor at what he calls the Court, meaning\r\nthe circle of the Governor-General. \"I find this place so amusing,\" he\r\nwrites ironically to Bourlamaque, \"that I wish Holy Week could be\r\nlengthened, to give me a pretext for neither making nor receiving\r\nvisits, staying at home, and dining there almost alone. Burn all my\r\nletters, as I do yours.\" And in the next week: \"Lent and devotion have\r\nupset my stomach and given me a cold; which does not prevent me from\r\nhaving the Governor-General at dinner to-day to end his lenten fast,\r\naccording to custom here.\" Two days after he announces: \"To-day a grand\r\ndinner at Martel's; twenty-three persons, all big-wigs (_les grosses\r\nperruques_); no ladies. We still have got to undergo those of Péan,\r\nDeschambault, and the Chevalier de Lévis. I spend almost every evening\r\nin my chamber, the place I like best, and where I am least bored.\"\r\n\r\nWith the opening spring there were changes in the modes of amusement.\r\nPicnics began, Vaudreuil and his wife being often of the party, as too\r\nwas Lévis. The Governor also made visits of compliment at the houses of\r\nthe seigniorial proprietors along the river; \"very much,\" says Montcalm,\r\nas \"Henri IV. did to the bourgeois notables of Paris. I live as usual,\r\nfencing in the morning, dining, and passing the evening at home or at\r\nthe Governor's. Péan has gone up to La Chine to spend six days with the\r\nreigning sultana [_Péan's wife, mistress of Bigot_]. As for me, my\r\n_ennui_ increases. I don't know what to do, or say, or read, or where to\r\ngo; and I think that at the end of the next campaign I shall ask\r\nbluntly, blindly, for my recall, only because I am bored.\"[537]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 537: _Montcalm à Bourlamaque_, 22 _Mai_, 1758.]\r\n\r\nHis relations with Vaudreuil were a constant annoyance to him,\r\nnotwithstanding the mask of mutual civility. \"I never,\" he tells his\r\nmother, \"ask for a place in the colony troops for anybody. You need not\r\nbe an Oedipus to guess this riddle. Here are four lines from\r\nCorneille:--\r\n\r\n   \"'Mon crime véritable est d'avoir aujourd'hui\r\n    Plus de nom que ... [_Vaudreuil_], plus de vertus que lui,\r\n    Et c'est de là que part cette secrète haine\r\n    Que le temps ne rendra que plus forte et plus pleine.'\r\n\r\nNevertheless I live here on good terms with everybody, and do my best to\r\nserve the King. If they could but do without me; if they could but\r\nspring some trap on me, or if I should happen to meet with some check!\"\r\n\r\nVaudreuil meanwhile had written to the Court in high praise of Lévis,\r\nhinting that he, and not Montcalm, ought to have the chief command.[538]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 538: _Vaudreuil au Ministre de la Marine, 16 Sept. 1757.\r\nIbid., au Ministre de la Guerre, même date_.]\r\n\r\nUnder the hollow gayeties of the ruling class lay a great public\r\ndistress, which broke at last into riot. Towards midwinter no flour was\r\nto be had in Montreal; and both soldiers and people were required to\r\naccept a reduced ration, partly of horse-flesh. A mob gathered before\r\nthe Governor's house, and a deputation of women beset him, crying out\r\nthat the horse was the friend of man, and that religion forbade him to\r\nbe eaten. In reply he threatened them with imprisonment and hanging; but\r\nwith little effect, and the crowd dispersed, only to stir up the\r\nsoldiers quartered in the houses of the town. The colony regulars,\r\nill-disciplined at the best, broke into mutiny, and excited the\r\nbattalion of Béarn to join them. Vaudreuil was helpless; Montcalm was in\r\nQuebec; and the task of dealing with the mutineers fell upon Lévis, who\r\nproved equal to the crisis, took a high tone, threatened death to the\r\nfirst soldier who should refuse horse-flesh, assured them at the same\r\ntime that he ate it every day himself, and by a characteristic mingling\r\nof authority and tact, quelled the storm.[539]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 539: Bougainville, _Journal. Montcalm à Mirepoix, 20 Avril,\r\n1758_. Lévis, _Journal de la Guerre du Canada_.]\r\n\r\nThe prospects of the next campaign began to open. Captain Pouchot had\r\nwritten from Niagara that three thousand savages were waiting to be let\r\nloose against the English borders. \"What a scourge!\" exclaims\r\nBougainville. \"Humanity groans at being forced to use such monsters.\r\nWhat can be done against an invisible enemy, who strikes and vanishes,\r\nswift as the lightning? It is the destroying angel.\" Captain Hebecourt\r\nkept watch and ward at Ticonderoga, begirt with snow and ice, and much\r\nplagued by English rangers, who sometimes got into the ditch\r\nitself.[540] This was to reconnoitre the place in preparation for a\r\nwinter attack which Loudon had planned, but which, like the rest of his\r\nschemes, fell to the ground.[541] Towards midwinter a band of these\r\nintruders captured two soldiers and butchered some fifteen cattle close\r\nto the fort, leaving tied to the horns of one of them a note addressed\r\nto the commandant in these terms: \"I am obliged to you, sir, for the\r\nrest you have allowed me to take and the fresh meat you have sent me. I\r\nshall take good care of my prisoners. My compliments to the Marquis of\r\nMontcalm.\" Signed, Rogers.[542]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 540: _Montcalm à Bourlamaque, 28 Mars, 1758_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 541: _Loudon to Pitt, 14 Feb. 1758_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 542: _Journal de ce qui s'est passé en Canada, 1757, 1758_.\r\nCompare Rogers, _Journals_, 72-75.]\r\n\r\nA few weeks later Hebecourt had his revenge. About the middle of March a\r\nreport came to Montreal that a large party of rangers had been cut to\r\npieces a few miles from Ticonderoga, and that Rogers himself was among\r\nthe slain. This last announcement proved false; but the rangers had\r\nsuffered a crushing defeat. Colonel Haviland, commanding at Fort Edward,\r\nsent a hundred and eighty of them, men and officers, on a scouting party\r\ntowards Ticonderoga; and Captain Pringle and Lieutenant Roche, of the\r\ntwenty-seventh regiment, joined them as volunteers, no doubt through a\r\nlove of hardy adventure, which was destined to be fully satisfied.\r\nRogers commanded the whole. They passed down Lake George on the ice\r\nunder cover of night, and then, as they neared the French outposts,\r\npursued their way by land behind Rogers Rock and the other mountains of\r\nthe western shore. On the preceding day, the twelfth of March, Hebecourt\r\nhad received a reinforcement of two hundred Mission Indians and a body\r\nof Canadians. The Indians had no sooner arrived than, though nominally\r\nChristians, they consulted the spirits, by whom they were told that the\r\nEnglish were coming. On this they sent out scouts, who came back\r\nbreathless, declaring that they had found a great number of snow-shoe\r\ntracks. The superhuman warning being thus confirmed, the whole body of\r\nIndians, joined by a band of Canadians and a number of volunteers from\r\nthe regulars, set out to meet the approaching enemy, and took their way\r\nup the valley of Trout Brook, a mountain gorge that opens from the west\r\nupon the valley of Ticonderoga.\r\n\r\nTowards three o'clock on the afternoon of that day Rogers had reached a\r\npoint nearly west of the mountain that bears his name. The rough and\r\nrocky ground was buried four feet in snow, and all around stood the gray\r\ntrunks of the forest, bearing aloft their skeleton arms and tangled\r\nintricacy of leafless twigs. Close on the right was a steep hill, and at\r\na little distance on the left was the brook, lost under ice and snow. A\r\nscout from the front told Rogers that a party of Indians was approaching\r\nalong the bed of the frozen stream, on which he ordered his men to halt,\r\nface to that side, and advance cautiously. The Indians soon appeared,\r\nand received a fire that killed some of them and drove back the rest in\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nNot suspecting that they were but an advance-guard, about half the\r\nrangers dashed in pursuit, and were soon met by the whole body of the\r\nenemy. The woods rang with yells and musketry. In a few minutes some\r\nfifty of the pursuers were shot down, and the rest driven back in\r\ndisorder upon their comrades. Rogers formed them all on the slope of the\r\nhill; and here they fought till sunset with stubborn desperation, twice\r\nrepulsing the overwhelming numbers of the assailants, and thwarting all\r\ntheir efforts to gain the heights in the rear. The combatants were often\r\nnot twenty yards apart, and sometimes they were mixed together. At\r\nlength a large body of Indians succeeded in turning the right flank of\r\nthe rangers. Lieutenant Phillips and a few men were sent by Rogers to\r\noppose the movement; but they quickly found themselves surrounded, and\r\nafter a brave defence surrendered on a pledge of good treatment. Rogers\r\nnow advised the volunteers, Pringle and Roche, to escape while there was\r\ntime, and offered them a sergeant as guide; but they gallantly resolved\r\nto stand by him. Eight officers and more than a hundred rangers lay dead\r\nand wounded in the snow. Evening was near and the forest was darkening\r\nfast, when the few survivors broke and fled. Rogers with about twenty\r\nfollowers escaped up the mountain; and gathering others about him, made\r\na running fight against the Indian pursuers, reached Lake George, not\r\nwithout fresh losses, and after two days of misery regained Fort Edward\r\nwith the remnant of his band. The enemy on their part suffered heavily,\r\nthe chief loss falling on the Indians; who, to revenge themselves,\r\nmurdered all the wounded and nearly all the prisoners, and tying\r\nLieutenant Phillips and his men to trees, hacked them to pieces.\r\n\r\nCaptain Pringle and Lieutenant Roche had become separated from the other\r\nfugitives; and, ignorant of woodcraft, they wandered by moonlight amid\r\nthe desolation of rocks and snow, till early in the night they met a man\r\nwhom they knew as a servant of Rogers, and who said that he could guide\r\nthem to Fort Edward. One of them had lost his snow-shoes in the fight;\r\nand, crouching over a miserable fire of broken sticks, they worked till\r\nmorning to make a kind of substitute with forked branches, twigs, and a\r\nfew leather strings. They had no hatchet to cut firewood, no blankets,\r\nno overcoats, and no food except part of a Bologna sausage and a little\r\nginger which Pringle had brought with him. There was no game; not even a\r\nsquirrel was astir; and their chief sustenance was juniper-berries and\r\nthe inner bark of trees. But their worst calamity was the helplessness\r\nof their guide. His brain wandered; and while always insisting that he\r\nknew the country well, he led them during four days hither and thither\r\namong a labyrinth of nameless mountains, clambering over rocks, wading\r\nthrough snowdrifts, struggling among fallen trees, till on the fifth day\r\nthey saw with despair that they had circled back to their own\r\nstarting-point. On the next morning, when they were on the ice of Lake\r\nGeorge, not far from Rogers Rock, a blinding storm of sleet and snow\r\ndrove in their faces. Spent as they were, it was death to stop; and\r\nbending their heads against the blast, they fought their way forward,\r\nnow on the ice, and now in the adjacent forest, till in the afternoon\r\nthe storm ceased, and they found themselves on the bank of an unknown\r\nstream. It was the outlet of the lake; for they had wandered into the\r\nvalley of Ticonderoga, and were not three miles from the French fort.\r\nIn crossing the torrent Pringle lost his gun, and was near losing his\r\nlife. All three of the party were drenched to the skin; and, becoming\r\nnow for the first time aware of where they were, they resolved on\r\nyielding themselves prisoners to save their lives. Night, however, again\r\nfound them in the forest. Their guide became delirious, saw visions of\r\nIndians all around, and, murmuring incoherently, straggled off a little\r\nway, seated himself in the snow, and was soon dead. The two officers,\r\nthemselves but half alive, walked all night round a tree to keep the\r\nblood in motion. In the morning, again toiling on, they presently saw\r\nthe fort across the intervening snowfields, and approached it, waving a\r\nwhite handkerchief. Several French officers dashed towards them at full\r\nspeed, and reached them in time to save them from the clutches of the\r\nIndians, whose camps were near at hand. They were kindly treated,\r\nrecovered from the effects of their frightful ordeal, and were\r\nafterwards exchanged. Pringle lived to old age, and died in 1800, senior\r\nmajor-general of the British army.[543]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 543: Rogers, two days after reaching Fort Edward, made a\r\ndetailed report of the fight, which was printed in the _New Hampshire\r\nGazette_ and other provincial papers. It is substantially incorporated\r\nin his published _Journals_, which also contain a long letter from\r\nPringle to Colonel Haviland, dated at Carillon (Ticonderoga), 28 March,\r\nand giving an excellent account of his and Roche's adventures. It was\r\nsent by a flag of truce, which soon after arrived from Fort Edward with\r\na letter for Vaudreuil. The French accounts of the fight are _Hebecourt\r\nà [Vaudreuil?], 15 Mars, 1758. Montcalm au Ministre de la Guerre, 10\r\nAvril, 1758_. Bougainville, _Journal. Relation de l'Affaire de Roger, 19\r\nMars_, 1758. _Autre Relation, même date_. Lévis, _Journal_. According to\r\nLévis, the French force consisted of 250 Indians and Canadians, and a\r\nnumber of officers, cadets, and soldiers. Roger puts it at 700. Most of\r\nthe French writers put the force of the rangers, correctly, at about\r\n180. Rogers reports his loss at 125. None of the wounded seem to have\r\nescaped, being either murdered after the fight, or killed by exposure in\r\nthe woods. The Indians brought in 144 scalps, having no doubt divided\r\nsome of them, after their ingenious custom. Rogers threw off his\r\novercoat during the fight, and it was found on the field, with his\r\ncommission in the pocket; whence the report of his death. There is an\r\nunsupported tradition that he escaped by sliding on his snow-shoes down\r\na precipice of Rogers Rock.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 17\r\n\r\n1753-1760\r\n\r\nBigot\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this stormy epoch of Canadian history the sinister figure of the\r\nIntendant Bigot moves conspicuous on the scene. Not that he was\r\nanswerable for all the manifold corruption that infected the colony, for\r\nmuch of it was rife before his time, and had a vitality of its own; but\r\nhis office and character made him the centre of it, and, more than any\r\nother man, he marshalled and organized the forces of knavery.\r\n\r\nIn the dual government of Canada the Governor represented the King and\r\ncommanded the troops; while the Intendant was charged with trade,\r\nfinance, justice, and all other departments of civil administration. In\r\nformer times the two functionaries usually quarrelled; but between\r\nVaudreuil and Bigot there was perfect harmony.\r\n\r\nFrançois Bigot, in the words of his biographer, was \"born in the bosom\r\nof the magistracy,\" both his father and his grandfather having held\r\nhonorable positions in the parliament of Bordeaux.[544] In appearance he\r\nwas not prepossessing, though his ugly, pimpled face was joined with\r\neasy and agreeable manners. In spite of indifferent health, he was\r\nuntiring both in pleasure and in work, a skilful man of business, of\r\ngreat official experience, energetic, good-natured, free-handed, ready\r\nto oblige his friends and aid them in their needs at the expense of the\r\nKing, his master; fond of social enjoyments, lavish in hospitality.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 544: _Procès de Bigot, Cadet, et autres, Mémoire pour Messire\r\nFrançois Bigot, accusé, contre Monsieur le Procureur-Général du Roi,\r\naccusateur._]\r\n\r\nA year or two before the war began, the engineer Franquet was sent from\r\nFrance to strengthen Louisbourg and inspect the defences of Canada. He\r\nkept a copious journal, full of curious observation, and affording\r\nbright glimpses not only of the social life of the Intendant, but of\r\nCanadian society in the upper or official class. Thus, among various\r\nmatters of the kind, he gives us the following. Bigot, who was in\r\nQuebec, had occasion to go to Montreal to meet the Governor; and this\r\nofficial journey was turned into a pleasure excursion, of which the King\r\npaid all the costs. Those favored with invitations, a privilege highly\r\nprized, were Franquet, with seven or eight military officers and a\r\ncorresponding number of ladies, including the wife of Major Pean, of\r\nwhom Bigot was enamoured. A chief steward, cooks, servants, and other\r\nattendants, followed the party. The guests had been requested to send\r\ntheir portmanteaus to the Intendant's Palace six days before, that they\r\nmight be sent forward on sledges along with bedding, table, service,\r\ncooking utensils, and numberless articles of comfort and luxury. Orders\r\nwere given to the inhabitants along the way, on pain of imprisonment, to\r\nlevel the snowdrifts and beat the road smooth with ox-teams, as also to\r\nprovide relays of horses. It is true that they were well paid for this\r\nlast service; so well that the hire of a horse to Montreal and back\r\nagain would cost the King the entire value of the animal. On the eighth\r\nof February the party met at the palace; and after a grand dinner set\r\nout upon their journey in twenty or more sleighs, some with two guests\r\nand a driver, and the rest with servants and attendants. The procession\r\npassed at full trot along St. Vallier street amid the shouts of an\r\nadmiring crowd, stopped towards night at Pointe-aux-Trembles, where each\r\nlooked for lodging; and then they all met and supped with the Intendant.\r\nThe militia captain of the place was ordered to have fresh horses ready\r\nat seven in the morning, when Bigot regaled his friends with tea,\r\ncoffee, and chocolate, after which they set out again, drove to\r\nCap-Santé, and stopped two hours at the house of the militia captain to\r\nbreakfast and warm themselves. In the afternoon they reached Ste.\r\nAnne-de-la-Pérade, when Bigot gave them a supper at the house in which\r\nhe lodged, and they spent the evening at cards.\r\n\r\nThe next morning brought them to Three Rivers, where Madame Marin,\r\nFranquet's travelling companion, wanted to stop to see her sister, the\r\nwife of Rigaud, who was then governor of the place. Madame de Rigaud,\r\nbeing ill, received her visitors in bed, and ordered an ample dinner to\r\nbe provided for them; after which they returned to her chamber for\r\ncoffee and conversation. Then they all set out again, saluted by the\r\ncannon of the fort.\r\n\r\nTheir next stopping-place was Isle-au-Castor, where, being seated at\r\ncards before supper, they were agreeably surprised by the appearance of\r\nthe Governor, who had come down from Montreal to meet them with four\r\nofficers, Duchesnaye, Marin, Le Mercier, and Péan. Many were the\r\nembraces and compliments; and in the morning they all journeyed on\r\ntogether, stopping towards night at the largest house they could find,\r\nwhere their servants took away the partitions to make room, and they sat\r\ndown to a supper, followed by the inevitable game of cards. On the next\r\nnight they reached Montreal and were lodged at the intendency, the\r\nofficial residence of the hospitable Bigot. The succeeding day was spent\r\nin visiting persons of eminence and consideration, among whom are to be\r\nnoted the names, soon to become notorious, of Varin, naval commissary,\r\nMartel, King's storekeeper, Antoine Penisseault, and François Maurin. A\r\nsuccession of festivities followed, including the benediction of three\r\nflags for a band of militia on their way to the Ohio. All persons of\r\nquality in Montreal were invited on this occasion, and the Governor gave\r\nthem a dinner and a supper. Bigot, however, outdid him in the plenitude\r\nof his hospitality, since, in the week before Lent, forty guests supped\r\nevery evening at his table, and dances, masquerades, and cards consumed\r\nthe night.[545]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 545: Franquet, _Journal_.]\r\n\r\nHis chief abode was at Quebec, in the capacious but somewhat ugly\r\nbuilding known as the Intendant's Palace. Here it was his custom during\r\nthe war to entertain twenty persons at dinner every day; and there was\r\nalso a hall for dancing, with a gallery to which the citizens were\r\nadmitted as spectators.[546] The bounteous Intendant provided a separate\r\ndancing-hall for the populace; and, though at the same time he plundered\r\nand ruined them, his gracious demeanor long kept him a place in their\r\nhearts. Gambling was the chief feature of his entertainments, and the\r\nstakes grew deeper as the war went on. He played desperately himself,\r\nand early in 1758 lost two hundred and four thousand francs,--a loss\r\nwhich he will knew how to repair. Besides his official residence on the\r\nbanks of the St. Charles, he had a country house about five miles\r\ndistant, a massive old stone building in the woods at the foot of the\r\nmountain of Charlebourg; its ruins are now known as Chateau Bigot. In\r\nits day it was called the Hermitage; though the uses to which it was\r\napplied savored nothing of asceticism. Tradition connects it and its\r\nowner with a romantic, but more than doubtful, story of love, jealousy,\r\nand murder.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 546: De Gaspé, _Mémoires_, 119.]\r\n\r\nThe chief Canadian families were so social in their habits and so\r\nconnected by intermarriage that, along with the French civil and\r\nmilitary officers of the colonial establishment, they formed a society\r\nwhose members all knew each other, like the corresponding class in\r\nVirginia. There was among them a social facility and ease rare in\r\ndemocratic communities; and in the ladies of Quebec and Montreal were\r\noften seen graces which visitors from France were astonished to find at\r\nthe edge of a wilderness. Yet this small though lively society had\r\nanomalies which grew more obtrusive towards the close of the war.\r\nKnavery makes strange companions; and at the tables of high civil\r\nofficials and colony officers of rank sat guests as boorish in manners\r\nas they were worthless in character.\r\n\r\nForemost among these was Joseph Cadet, son of a butcher at Quebec, who\r\nat thirteen went to sea as a pilot's boy, then kept the cows of an\r\ninhabitant of Charlebourg, and at last took up his father's trade and\r\nprospered in it.[547] In 1756 Bigot got him appointed commissary-general,\r\nand made a contract with him which flung wide open the doors of peculation.\r\nIn the next two years Cadet and his associates,Péan, Maurin, Corpron, and\r\nPenisseault, sold to the King, for about twenty-three million francs,\r\nprovisions which cost them eleven millions, leaving a net profit of about\r\ntwelve millions. It was not legally proved that the Intendant shared\r\nCadet's gains; but there is no reasonable doubt that he did so.\r\nBigot's chief profits rose, however, from other sources. It was his\r\nbusiness to see that the King's storehouses for the supply of troops,\r\nmilitia, and Indians were kept well stocked. To this end he and Bréard,\r\nnaval comptroller at Quebec, made a partnership with the commercial house\r\nof Gradis and Son at Bordeaux. He next told the Colonial Minister that\r\nthere were stores enough already in Canada to last three years, and that it\r\nwould be more to the advantage of the King to buy them in the colony than\r\nto take the risk of sending them from France.[548] Gradis and Son then\r\nshipped them to Canada in large quantities, while Bréard or his agent\r\ndeclared at the custom-house that they belonged to the King, and so\r\nescaped the payment of duties. Theywere then, as occasion rose, sold to\r\nthe King at a huge profit, always under fictitious names. Often they were\r\nsold to some favored merchant or speculator, who sold them in turn to\r\nBigot's confederate, the King's storekeeper; and sometimes they passed\r\nthrough several successive hands, till the price rose to double or triple\r\nthe first cost, the Intendant and his partners sharing the gains with\r\nfriends and allies. They would let nobody else sell to the King; and\r\nthus a grinding monopoly was established, to the great profit of those\r\nwho held it.[549]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 547: _Procès de Bigot, Cadet, et autres, Mémoire pour Messire\r\nFrançois Bigot_. Compare _Mémoires sur le Canada_, 1749-1760.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 548: _Bigot au Ministre, 8 Oct. 1749._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 549: _Procés de Bigot, Cadet, et autres. Mémoire sur les\r\nFraudes commises dans la Colonie._ Compare _Mémoires sur le Canada,\r\n1749-1760_.]\r\n\r\nUnder the name of a trader named Claverie, Bigot, some time before the\r\nwar, set up a warehouse on land belonging to the King and not far from\r\nhis own palace. Here the goods shipped from Bordeaux were collected, to\r\nbe sold in retail to the citizens, and in wholesale to favored merchants\r\nand the King. This establishment was popularly known as La Friponne, at\r\nMontreal, which was leagued with that of Quebec, and received goods from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBigot and his accomplices invented many other profitable frauds. Thus he\r\nwas charged with the disposal of the large quantity of furs belonging to\r\nhis master, which it was his duty to sell at public auction, after due\r\nnotice, to the highest bidder. Instead of this, he sold them privately\r\nat a low price to his own confederates. It was also his duty to provide\r\ntransportation for troops, artillery, provisions, and stores, in which\r\nhe made good profit by letting to the King, at high prices, boats or\r\nvessels which he had himself bought or hired for the purpose.[550]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 550: _Jugement rendu souverainement dans l'Affaire du\r\nCanada._]\r\n\r\nYet these and other illicit gains still left him but the second place as\r\npublic plunderer. Cadet, the commissary-general, reaped an ampler\r\nharvest, and became the richest man in the colony. One of the operations\r\nof this scoundrel, accomplished with the help of Bigot, consisted in\r\nbuying for six hundred thousand francs a quantity of stores belonging to\r\nthe King, and then selling them back to him for one million four hundred\r\nthousand.[551] It was further shown on his trial that in 1759 he\r\nreceived 1,614,354 francs for stores furnished at the post of\r\nMiramichi, while the value of those actually furnished was but 889,544\r\nfrancs; thus giving him a fraudulent profit of more than seven hundred\r\nand twenty-four thousand.[552] Cadet's chief resource was the\r\nfalsification of accounts. The service of the King in Canada was fenced\r\nabout by rigid formalities. When supplies were wanted at any of the\r\nmilitary posts, the commandant made a requisition specifying their\r\nnature and quantity, while, before pay could be drawn for them, the\r\nKing's storekeeper, the local commissary, and the inspector must set\r\ntheir names as vouchers to the list, and finally Bigot must sign\r\nit.[553] But precautions were useless where all were leagued to rob the\r\nKing. It appeared on Cadet's trial that by gifts of wine, brandy, or\r\nmoney he had bribed the officers, both civil and military, at all the\r\nprincipal forts to attest the truth of accounts in which the supplies\r\nfurnished by him were set at more than twice their true amount. Of the\r\nmany frauds charged against him there was one peculiarly odious. Large\r\nnumbers of refugee Acadians were to be supplied with rations to keep\r\nthem alive. Instead of wholesome food, mouldered and unsalable salt cod\r\nwas sent them, and paid for by the King at inordinate prices.[554] It\r\nwas but one of many heartless outrages practised by Canadian officials\r\non this unhappy people.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 551: _Procès de Bigot, Cadet, et autres, Requête du\r\nProcureur-Général, 19 Dec_. 1761.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 552: _Procès de Bigot, Cadet, et autres, Mémoire pour Messire\r\nFrançois Bigot_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 553: _Mémoire sur le Canada_ (Archives Nationales).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 554: _Mémoires sur le Canada_, 1749-1760.]\r\n\r\nCadet told the Intendant that the inhabitants were hoarding their grain,\r\nand got an order from him requiring them to sell it at a low fixed\r\nprice, on pain of having it seized. Thus nearly the whole fell into his\r\nhands. Famine ensued; and he then sold it at a great profit, partly to\r\nthe King, and partly to its first owners. Another of his devices was to\r\nsell provisions to the King which, being sent to the outlying forts,\r\nwere falsely reported as consumed; on which he sold them to the King a\r\nsecond time. Not without reason does a writer of the time exclaim: \"This\r\nis the land of abuses, ignorance, prejudice, and all that is monstrous\r\nin government. Peculation, monopoly, and plunder have become a\r\nbottomless abyss.\"[555]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 555: _Considérations sur l'État présent du Canada_.]\r\n\r\nThe command of a fort brought such opportunities of making money that,\r\naccording to Bougainville, the mere prospect of appointment to it for\r\nthe usual term of three years was thought enough for a young man to\r\nmarry upon. It was a favor in the gift of the Governor, who was accused\r\nof sharing the profits. These came partly from the fur-trade, and still\r\nmore from frauds of various kinds. For example, a requisition was made\r\nfor supplies as gifts to the Indians in order to keep them friendly or\r\nsend them on the war-path; and their number was put many times above the\r\ntruth in order to get more goods, which the commandant and his\r\nconfederates then bartered for furs on their own account, instead of\r\ngiving them as presents. \"And,\" says a contemporary, addressing the\r\nColonial Minister, \"those who treat the savages so basely are officers\r\nof the King, depositaries of his authority, ministers of that Great\r\nOnontio whom they call their father.\"[556] At the post of Green Bay, the\r\npartisan officer Marin, and Rigaud, the Governor's brother, made in a\r\nshort time a profit of three hundred and twelve thousand francs.[557]\r\n\"Why is it,\" asks Bougainville, \"that of all which the King sends to the\r\nIndians two thirds are stolen, and the rest sold to them instead of\r\nbeing given?\"[558]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 556: _Considérations sur l'État présent du Canada_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 557: _Mémoire sur les Fraudes commises dans la Colonie_.\r\nBougainville, _Mémoire sur l'État de la Nouvelle France_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 558: Bougainville, _Journal_.]\r\n\r\nThe transportation of military stores gave another opportunity of\r\nplunder. The contractor would procure from the Governor or the local\r\ncommandant an order requiring the inhabitants to serve him as boatmen,\r\ndrivers, or porters, under a promise of exemption that year from duty as\r\nsoldiers. This saved him his chief item of expense, and the profits of\r\nhis contract rose in proportion.\r\n\r\nA contagion of knavery ran through the official life of the colony; and\r\nto resist it demanded no common share of moral robustness. The officers\r\nof the troops of the line were not much within its influence; but those\r\nof the militia and colony regulars, whether of French or Canadian birth,\r\nshared the corruption of the civil service. Seventeen of them, including\r\nsix chevaliers of St. Louis and eight commandants of forts, were\r\nafterwards arraigned for fraud and malversation, though some of the\r\nnumber were acquitted. Bougainville gives the names of four other\r\nCanadian officers as honorable exceptions to the general\r\ndemoralization,--Benoît, Repentigny, Lainé, and Le Borgne; \"not enough,\"\r\nhe observes, \"to save Sodom.\"\r\n\r\nConspicuous among these military thieves was Major Péan, whose qualities\r\nas a soldier have been questioned, but who nevertheless had shown almost\r\nas much vigor in serving the King during the Ohio campaign of 1753 as\r\nhe afterwards displayed effrontery in cheating him. \"Le petit Péan\" had\r\nmarried a young wife, Mademoiselle Desméloizes, Canadian like himself,\r\nwell born, and famed for beauty, vivacity, and wit. Bigot, who was near\r\nsixty, became her accepted lover; and the fortune of Péan was made. His\r\nfirst success seems to have taken him by surprise. He had bought as a\r\nspeculation a large quantity of grain, with money of the King lent him\r\nby the Intendant. Bigot, officially omnipotent, then issued an order\r\nraising the commodity to a price far above that paid by Péan, who thus\r\nmade a profit of fifty thousand crowns.[559] A few years later his\r\nwealth was estimated at from two to four million francs. Madame Péan\r\nbecame a power in Canada, the dispenser of favors and offices; and all\r\nwho sought opportunity to rob the King hastened to pay her their court.\r\nPéan, jilted by his own wife, made prosperous love to the wife of his\r\npartner, Penisseault; who, though the daughter of a Montreal tradesman,\r\nhad the air of a woman of rank, and presided with dignity and grace at a\r\nhospitable board where were gathered the clerks of Cadet and other\r\nlesser lights of the administrative hierarchy. It was often honored by\r\nthe presence of the Chevalier de Lévis, who, captivated by the charms of\r\nthe hostess, condescended to a society which his friends condemned as\r\nunworthy of his station. He succeeded Péan in the graces of Madame\r\nPenisseault, and after the war took her with him to France; while the\r\naggrieved husband found consolation in the wives of the small\r\nfunctionaries under his orders.[560]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 559: _Mémoires sur le Canada, 1749-1760. Mémoire sur les\r\nFraudes_, etc. Compare Pouchot, I. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 560: _Mémoires sur le Canada_, 1749-1760.]\r\n\r\nAnother prominent name on the roll of knavery was that of Varin,\r\ncommissary of marine, and Bigot's deputy at Montreal, a Frenchman of low\r\ndegree, small in stature, sharp witted, indefatigable, conceited,\r\narrogant, headstrong, capricious, and dissolute. Worthless as he was, he\r\nfound a place in the Court circle of the Governor, and aspired to\r\nsupplant Bigot in the intendancy. To this end, as well as to save\r\nhimself from justice, he had the fatuity to turn informer and lay bare\r\nthe sins of his confederates, though forced at the same time to betray\r\nhis own. Among his comrades and allies may be mentioned Deschenaux, son\r\nof a shoemaker at Quebec, and secretary to the Intendant; Martel, King's\r\nstorekeeper at Montreal; the humpback Maurin, who is not to be\r\nconfounded with the partisan officer Marin; and Corpron, a clerk whom\r\nseveral tradesmen had dismissed for rascality, but who was now in the\r\nconfidence of Cadet, to whom he made himself useful, and in whose\r\nservice he grew rich.\r\n\r\nCanada was the prey of official jackals,--true lion's providers, since\r\nthey helped to prepare a way for the imperial beast, who, roused at last\r\nfrom his lethargy, was gathering his strength to seize her for his own.\r\nHonesty could not be expected from a body of men clothed with arbitrary\r\nand ill-defined powers, ruling with absolute sway an unfortunate people\r\nwho had no voice in their own destinies, and answerable only to an\r\napathetic master three thousand miles away. Nor did the Canadian Church,\r\nthough supreme, check the corruptions that sprang up and flourished\r\nunder its eye. The Governor himself was charged with sharing the\r\nplunder; and though he was acquitted on his trial, it is certain that\r\nBigot had him well in hand, that he was intimate with the chief robbers,\r\nand that they found help in his weak compliances and wilful blindness.\r\nHe put his stepson, Le Verrier, in command at Michillimackinac, where,\r\nby fraud and the connivance of his stepfather, the young man made a\r\nfortune.[561] When the Colonial Minister berated the Intendant for\r\nmaladministration, Vaudreuil became his advocate, and wrote thus in his\r\ndefence: \"I cannot conceal from you, Monseigneur, how deeply M. Bigot\r\nfeels the suspicions expressed in your letters to him. He does not\r\ndeserve them, I am sure. He is full of zeal for the service of the King;\r\nbut as he is rich, or passes as such, and as he has merit, the\r\nill-disposed are jealous, and insinuate that he has prospered at the\r\nexpense of His Majesty. I am certain that it is not true, and that\r\nnobody is a better citizen than he, or has the King's interest more at\r\nheart.\"[562] For Cadet, the butcher's son, the Governor asked a patent\r\nof nobility as a reward for his services.[563] When Péan went to France\r\nin 1758, Vaudreuil wrote to the Colonial Minister: \"I have great\r\nconfidence in him. He knows the colony and its needs. You can trust all\r\nhe says. He will explain everything in the best manner. I shall be\r\nextremely sensible to any kindness you may show him, and hope that when\r\nyou know him you will like him as much as I do.\"[564]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 561: _Mémoires sur le Canada_, 1749-1760.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 562: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 15 Oct. 1759._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 563: _Ibid., 7 Nov. 1759._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 564: _Ibid., 6 Août, 1758._]\r\n\r\nAdministrative corruption was not the only bane of Canada. Her financial\r\ncondition was desperate. The ordinary circulating medium consisted of\r\nwhat was known as card money, and amounted to only a million of francs.\r\nThis being insufficient, Bigot, like his predecessor Hocquart, issued\r\npromissory notes on his own authority, and made them legal tender. They\r\nwere for sums from one franc to a hundred, and were called\r\n_ordonnances_. Their issue was blamed at Versailles as an encroachment\r\non the royal prerogative, though they were recognized by the Ministry in\r\nview of the necessity of the case. Every autumn those who held them to\r\nany considerable amount might bring them to the colonial treasurer, who\r\ngave in return bills of exchange on the royal treasury in France. At\r\nfirst these bills were promptly paid; then delays took place, and the\r\nnotes depreciated; till in 1759 the Ministry, aghast at the amount,\r\nrefused payment, and the utmost dismay and confusion followed.[565]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 565: _Réflections sommaires sur le Commerce qui s'est fait en\r\nCanada. État présent du Canada_. Compare Stevenson, _Card Money of\r\nCanada_, in _Transactions of the Historical Society of Quebec_,\r\n1873-1875.]\r\n\r\nThe vast jarring, discordant mechanism of corruption grew\r\nincontrollable; it seized upon Bigot, and dragged him, despite himself,\r\ninto perils which his prudence would have shunned. He was becoming a\r\nvictim to the rapacity of his own confederates, whom he dared not offend\r\nby refusing his connivance and his signature of frauds which became more\r\nand more recklessly audacious. He asked leave to retire from office, in\r\nthe hope that his successor would bear the brunt of the ministerial\r\ndispleasure. Péan had withdrawn already, and with the fruits of his\r\nplunder bought land in France, where he thought himself safe. But though\r\nthe Intendant had long been an object of distrust, and had often been\r\nwarned to mend his ways,[566] yet such was his energy, his executive\r\npower, and his fertility of resource, that in the crisis of the war it\r\nwas hard to dispense with him. Neither his abilities, however, nor his\r\nstrong connections in France, nor an ally whom he had secured in the\r\nbureau of the Colonial Minister himself, could avail him much longer;\r\nand the letters from Versailles became appalling in rebuke and menace.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 566: _Ordres du Roy et Dépêches des Ministres, 1751-1758._]\r\n\r\n\"The ship 'Britannia,'\" wrote the Minister, Berryer, \"laden with goods\r\nsuch as are wanted in the colony, was captured by a privateer from St.\r\nMalo, and brought into Quebec. You sold the whole cargo for eight\r\nhundred thousand francs. The purchasers made a profit of two millions.\r\nYou bought back a part for the King at one million, or two hundred\r\nthousand more than the price which you sold the whole. With conduct like\r\nthis it is no wonder that the expenses of the colony become\r\ninsupportable. The amount of your drafts on the treasury is frightful.\r\nThe fortunes of your subordinates throw suspicion on your\r\nadministration.\" And in another letter on the same day: \"How could it\r\nhappen that the small-pox among the Indians cost the King a million\r\nfrancs? What does this expense mean? Who is answerable for it? Is it the\r\nofficers who command the posts, or is it the storekeepers? You give me\r\nno particulars. What has become of the immense quantity of provisions\r\nsent to Canada last year? I am forced to conclude that the King's stores\r\nare set down as consumed from the moment they arrive, and then sold to\r\nHis Majesty at exorbitant prices. Thus the King buys stores in France,\r\nand then buys them again in Canada. I no longer wonder at the immense\r\nfortunes made in the colony.\"[567] Some months later the Minister\r\nwrites: \"You pay bills without examination, and then find an error in\r\nyour accounts of three million six hundred thousand francs. In the\r\nletters from Canada I see nothing but incessant speculation in\r\nprovisions and goods, which are sold to the King for ten times more than\r\nthey cost in France. For the last time, I exhort you to give these\r\nthings your serious attention, for they will not escape from mine.\"[568]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 567: _Le Ministre à Bigot, 19 Jan. 1759._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 568: _Ibid., 29 Août, 1759._]\r\n\r\n\"I write, Monsieur, to answer your last two letters, in which you tell\r\nme that instead of sixteen millions, your drafts on the treasury for\r\n1758 will reach twenty-four millions, and that this year they will rise\r\nto from thirty-one to thirty-three millions. It seems, then, that there\r\nare no bounds to the expenses of Canada. They double almost every year,\r\nwhile you seem to give yourself no concern except to get them paid. Do\r\nyou suppose that I can advise the King to approve such an\r\nadministration? or do you think that you can take the immense sum of\r\nthirty-three millions out of the royal treasury by merely assuring me\r\nthat you have signed drafts for it? This, too, for expenses incurred\r\nirregularly, often needlessly, always wastefully; which make the fortune\r\nof everybody who has the least hand in them, and about which you know\r\nso little that after reporting them at sixteen millions, you find two\r\nmonths after that they will reach twenty-four. You are accused of having\r\ngiven the furnishing of provisions to one man, who under the name of\r\ncommissary-general, has set what prices he pleased; of buying for the\r\nKing at second or third hand what you might have got from the producer\r\nat half the price; of having in this and other ways made the fortunes of\r\npersons connected with you; and of living in splendor in the midst of a\r\npublic misery, which all the letters from the colony agree in ascribing\r\nto bad administration, and in charging M. de Vaudreuil with weakness in\r\nnot preventing.\"[569]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 569: _Le Ministre à Bigotû, 29 Août, 1759_ (second letter of\r\nthis date).]\r\n\r\nThese drastic utterances seem to have been partly due to a letter\r\nwritten by Montcalm in cipher to the Maréchal de Belleisle, then\r\nminister of war. It painted the deplorable condition of Canada, and\r\nexposed without reserve the peculations and robberies of those intrusted\r\nwith its interests. \"It seems,\" said the General, \"as if they were all\r\nhastening to make their fortunes before the loss of the colony; which\r\nmany of them perhaps desire as a veil to their conduct.\" He gives among\r\nother cases that of Le Mercier, chief of Canadian artillery, who had\r\ncome to Canada as a private soldier twenty years before, and had so\r\nprospered on fraudulent contracts that he would soon be worth nearly a\r\nmillion. \"I have often,\" continues Montcalm, \"spoken of these\r\nexpenditures to M. de Vaudreuil and M. Bigot; and each throws the blame\r\non the other.\"[570] And yet at the same time Vaudreuil was assuring the\r\nMinister that Bigot was without blame.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 570: _Montcalm au Ministre de la Guerre, Lettre\r\nconfidentielle, 12 Avril,_ 1759.]\r\n\r\nSome two months before Montcalm wrote this letter, the Minister,\r\nBerryer, sent a despatch to the Governor and Intendant which filled them\r\nwith ire and mortification. It ordered them to do nothing without\r\nconsulting the general of the French regulars, not only in matters of\r\nwar, but in all matters of administration touching the defence and\r\npreservation of the colony. A plainer proof of confidence on one hand\r\nand distrust on the other could not have been given.[571]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 571: _Le Ministre à Vaudreuil et Bigot, 20 Fév. 1759._]\r\n\r\nOne Querdisien-Tremais was sent from Bordeaux as an agent of Government\r\nto make investigation. He played the part of detective, wormed himself\r\ninto the secrets of the confederates, and after six months of patient\r\ninquisition traced out four distinct combinations for public plunder.\r\nExplicit orders were now given to Bigot, who, seeing no other escape,\r\nbroke with Cadet, and made him disgorge two millions of stolen money.\r\nThe Commissary-General and his partners became so terrified that they\r\nafterwards gave up nearly seven millions more.[572] Stormy events\r\nfollowed, and the culprits found shelter for a time amid the tumults of\r\nwar. Peculation did not cease, but a day of reckoning was at hand.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 572: _Procès de Bigot, Cadet, et autres, Mémoirs pour François\r\nBigot, 3'me partie_.]\r\n\r\nNOTE: The printed documents of the trial of Bigot and the other\r\npeculators include the defence of Bigot, of which the first part\r\noccupies 303 quarto pages, and the second part 764. Among the other\r\npapers are the arguments for Péan, Varin, Saint-Blin, Boishébert,\r\nMartel, Joncaire-Chabert and several more, along with the elaborate\r\n_Jugement rendue_, the _Requêtes du Procureur-Général,_ the _Réponse aux\r\nMémoires de M. Bigot et du Sieur Péan,_ etc., forming together five\r\nquarto volumes, all of which I have carefully examined. These are in the\r\nLibrary of Harvard University. There is another set, also of five\r\nvolumes, in the Library of the Historical Society of Quebec, containing\r\nmost of the papers just mentioned, and, bound with them, various others\r\nin manuscript, among which are documents in defence of Vaudreuil\r\n(printed in part); Estèbe, Corpron, Penisseault, Maurin, and Bréard. I\r\nhave examined this collection also. The manuscript _Ordres du Roy et\r\nDépêches des Ministres_, 1757-1760, as well as the letters of Vaudreuil,\r\nBougainville, Daine, Doreil, and Montcalm throw much light on the\r\nmaladministration of the time; as do many contemporary documents,\r\nnotably those entitled _Mémoire sur les Fraudes commises dans la\r\nColonie, État présent du Canada,_ and _Mémoire sur le Canada_ (Archives\r\nNationales). The remarkable anonymous work printed by the Historical\r\nSociety of Quebec under the title _Mémoires sur le Canada depuis 1749\r\njusqu'àé 1760, is full of curious matter concerning Bigot and his\r\nassociates which squares well with other evidence. This is the source\r\nfrom which Smith, in his _History of Canada_ (Quebec, 1815), drew most\r\nof his information on the subject. A manuscript which seems to be the\r\noriginal draft of this valuable document was preserved at the Bastile,\r\nand, with other papers, was thrown into the street when that castle was\r\ndestroyed. They were gathered up, and afterwards bought by a Russian\r\nnamed Dubrowski, who carried them to St. Petersburg. Lord Dufferin, when\r\nminister there, procured a copy of the manuscript in question, which is\r\nnow in the keeping of Abbé H. Verreau at Montreal, to whose kindness I\r\nowe the opportunity of examining it. In substance it differs little from\r\nthe printed work, though the language and the arrangement often vary\r\nfrom it. The author, whoever he may have been, was deeply versed in\r\nCanadian affairs of the time, and though often caustic, is generally\r\ntrustworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 18\r\n\r\n1757, 1758\r\n\r\nPitt\r\n\r\n\r\nThe war kindled in the American forest was now raging in full\r\nconflagration among the kingdoms of Europe; and in the midst stood\r\nFrederic of Prussia, a veritable fire-king. He had learned through\r\nsecret agents that he was to be attacked, and that the wrath of Maria\r\nTheresa with her two allies, Pompadour and the Empress of Russia, was\r\nsoon to wreak itself upon him. With his usual prompt audacity he\r\nanticipated his enemies, marched into Saxony, and began the Continental\r\nwar. His position seemed desperate. England, sundered from Austria, her\r\nold ally, had made common cause with him; but he had no other friend\r\nworth the counting. France, Russia, Austria, Sweden, Saxony, the\r\ncollective Germanic Empire, and most of the smaller German States had\r\njoined hands for his ruin, eager to crush him and divide the spoil,\r\nparcelling out his dominions among themselves in advance by solemn\r\nmutual compact. Against the five millions of Prussia were arrayed\r\npopulations of more than a hundred million. The little kingdom was open\r\non all sides to attack, and her enemies were spurred on by the bitterest\r\nanimosity. It was thought that one campaign would end the war. The war\r\nlasted seven years, and Prussia came out of it triumphant. Such a\r\nwarrior as her indomitable king Europe has rarely seen. If the Seven\r\nYears War made the maritime and colonial greatness of England, it also\r\nraised Prussia to the rank of a first-class Power.\r\n\r\nFrederic began with a victory, routing the Austrians in one of the\r\nfiercest of recorded conflicts, the battle of Prague. Then in his turn\r\nhe was beaten at Kolin. All seemed lost. The hosts of the coalition were\r\nrolling in upon him like a deluge. Surrounded by enemies, in the jaws of\r\ndestruction, hoping for little but to die in battle, this strange hero\r\nsolaced himself with an exhaustless effusion of bad verses, sometimes\r\nmournful, sometimes cynical, sometimes indignant, and sometimes\r\nbreathing a dauntless resolution; till, when his hour came, he threw\r\ndown his pen to achieve those feats of arms which stamp him one of the\r\nforemost soldiers of the world.\r\n\r\nThe French and Imperialists, in overwhelming force, thought to crush him\r\nat Rosbach. He put them to shameful rout; and then, instead of bonfires\r\nand Te Deums, mocked at them in doggerel rhymes of amazing indecency.\r\nWhile he was beating the French, the Austrians took Silesia from him. He\r\nmarched to recover it, found them strongly posted at Leuthen, eighty\r\nthousand men against thirty thousand, and without hesitation resolved to\r\nattack them. Never was he more heroic than on the eve of this, his\r\ncrowning triumph. \"The hour is at hand,\" he said to his generals. \"I\r\nmean, in spite of the rules of military art, to attack Prince Karl's\r\narmy, which is nearly thrice our own. This risk I must run, or all is\r\nlost. We must beat him or die, all of us, before his batteries.\" He\r\nburst unawares upon the Austrian left, and rolled their whole host\r\ntogether, corps upon corps, in a tumult of irretrievable ruin.\r\n\r\nWhile her great ally was reaping a full harvest of laurels, England,\r\ndragged into the Continental war because that apple of discord, Hanover,\r\nbelonged to her King, found little but humiliation. Minorca was wrested\r\nfrom her, and the Ministry had an innocent man shot to avert from\r\nthemselves the popular indignation; while the same Ministry, scared by a\r\nphantom of invasion, brought over German troops to defend British soil.\r\nBut now an event took place pregnant with glorious consequence. The\r\nreins of power fell into the hands of William Pitt. He had already held\r\nthem for a brief space, forced into office at the end of 1756 by popular\r\nclamor, in spite of the Whig leaders and against the wishes of the King.\r\nBut the place was untenable. Newcastle's Parliament would not support\r\nhim; the Duke of Cumberland opposed him; the King hated him; and in\r\nApril 1757, he was dismissed. Then ensued eleven weeks of bickering and\r\ndispute, during which, in the midst of a great war, England was left\r\nwithout a government. It became clear that none was possible without\r\nPitt; and none with him could be permanent and strong unless joined with\r\nthose influences which had thus far controlled the majorities of\r\nParliament. Therefore an extraordinary union was brought about; Lord\r\nChesterfield acting as go-between to reconcile the ill-assorted pair.\r\nOne of them brought to the alliance the confidence and support of the\r\npeople; the other, Court management, borough interest, and parliamentary\r\nconnections. Newcastle was made First Lord of the Treasury, and Pitt,\r\nthe old enemy who had repeatedly browbeat and ridiculed him, became\r\nSecretary of State, with the lead of the House of Commons and full\r\ncontrol of the war and foreign affairs. It was a partnership of magpie\r\nand eagle. The dirty work of government, intrigue, bribery, and all the\r\npatronage that did not affect the war, fell to the share of the old\r\npolitician. If Pitt could appoint generals, admirals, and ambassadors,\r\nNewcastle was welcome to the rest. \"I will borrow the Duke's majorities\r\nto carry on the government,\" said the new secretary; and with the\r\naudacious self-confidence that was one of his traits, he told the Duke\r\nof Devonshire, \"I am sure that I can save this country, and that nobody\r\nelse can.\" England hailed with one acclaim the undaunted leader who\r\nasked for no reward but the honor of serving her. The hour had found the\r\nman. For the next four years this imposing figure towers supreme in\r\nBritish history.\r\n\r\nHe had glaring faults, some of them of a sort not to have been expected\r\nin him. Vanity, the common weakness of small minds, was the most\r\ndisfiguring foible of this great one. He had not the simplicity which\r\nbecomes greatness so well. He could give himself theatrical airs, strike\r\nattitudes, and dart stage lightnings from his eyes; yet he was\r\nformidable even in his affectations. Behind his great intellectual\r\npowers lay a burning enthusiasm, a force of passion and fierce intensity\r\nof will, that gave redoubled impetus to the fiery shafts of his\r\neloquence; and the haughty and masterful nature of the man had its share\r\nin the ascendency which he long held over Parliament. He would blast the\r\nlabored argument of an adversary by a look of scorn or a contemptuous\r\nwave of the hand.\r\n\r\nThe Great Commoner was not a man of the people in the popular sense of\r\nthat hackneyed phrase. Though himself poor, being a younger son, he came\r\nof a rich and influential family; he was patrician at heart; both his\r\nfaults and his virtues, his proud incorruptibility and passionate,\r\ndomineering patriotism, bore the patrician stamp. Yet he loved liberty\r\nand he loved the people, because they were the English people. The\r\neffusive humanitarianism of to-day had no part in him, and the democracy\r\nof to-day would detest him. Yet to the middle-class England of his own\r\ntime, that unenfranchised England which had little representation in\r\nParliament, he was a voice, an inspiration, and a tower of strength. He\r\nwould not flatter the people; but, turning with contempt from the tricks\r\nand devices of official politics, he threw himself with a confidence\r\nthat never wavered on their patriotism and public spirit. They answered\r\nhim with a boundless trust, asked but to follow his lead, gave him\r\nwithout stint their money and their blood, loved him for his domestic\r\nvirtues and his disinterestedness, believed him even in his\r\nself-contradiction, and idolized him even in his bursts of arrogant\r\npassion. It was he who waked England from her lethargy, shook off the\r\nspell that Newcastle and his fellow-enchanters had cast over her, and\r\ntaught her to know herself again. A heart that beat in unison with all\r\nthat was British found responsive throbs in every corner of the vast\r\nempire that through him was to become more vast. With the instinct of\r\nhis fervid patriotism he would join all its far-extended members into\r\none, not by vain assertions of parliamentary supremacy, but by bonds of\r\nsympathy and ties of a common freedom and a common cause.\r\n\r\nThe passion for power and glory subdued in him all the sordid parts of\r\nhumanity, and he made the power and glory of England one with his own.\r\nHe could change front through resentment or through policy; but in\r\nwhatever path he moved, his objects were the same: not to curb the power\r\nof France in America, but to annihilate it; crush her navy, cripple her\r\nforeign trade, ruin her in India, in Africa, and wherever else, east or\r\nwest, she had found foothold; gain for England the mastery of the seas,\r\nopen to her the great highways of the globe, make her supreme in\r\ncommerce and colonization; and while limiting the activities of her\r\nrival to the European continent, give to her the whole world for a\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nTo this British Roman was opposed the pampered Sardanapalus of\r\nVersailles, with the silken favorite who by calculated adultery had\r\nbought the power to ruin France. The Marquise de Pompadour, who began\r\nlife as Jeanne Poisson,--Jane Fish,--daughter of the head clerk of a\r\nbanking house, who then became wife of a rich financier, and then, as\r\nmistress of the King, rose to a pinnacle of gilded ignominy, chose this\r\ntime to turn out of office the two ministers who had shown most ability\r\nand force,--Argenson, head of the department of war, and Machault, head\r\nof the marine and colonies; the one because he was not subservient to\r\nher will, and the other because he had unwittingly touched the self-love\r\nof her royal paramour. She aspired to a share in the conduct of the war,\r\nand not only made and unmade ministers and generals, but discussed\r\ncampaigns and battles with them, while they listened to her prating with\r\na show of obsequious respect, since to lose her favor was to risk losing\r\nall. A few months later, when blows fell heavy and fast, she turned a\r\ndeaf ear to representations of financial straits and military disasters,\r\nplayed the heroine, affected a greatness of soul superior to misfortune,\r\nand in her perfumed boudoir varied her tiresome graces by posing as a\r\nRoman matron. In fact she never wavered in her spite against Frederic,\r\nand her fortitude was perfect in bearing the sufferings of others and\r\ndefying dangers that could not touch her.\r\n\r\nWhen Pitt took office it was not over France, but over England that the\r\nclouds hung dense and black. Her prospects were of the gloomiest.\r\n\"Whoever is in or whoever is out,\" wrote Chesterfield, \"I am sure we are\r\nundone both at home and abroad: at home by our increasing debt and\r\nexpenses; abroad by our ill-luck and incapacity. We are no longer a\r\nnation.\" And his despondency was shared by many at the beginning of the\r\nmost triumphant Administration in British history. The shuffling\r\nweakness of his predecessors had left Pitt a heritage of tribulation.\r\nFrom America came news of Loudon's manifold failures; from Germany that\r\nof the miscarriage of the Duke of Cumberland, who, at the head of an\r\narmy of Germans in British pay, had been forced to sign the convention\r\nof Kloster-Zeven, by which he promised to disband them. To these\r\ndisasters was added a third, of which the new Government alone had to\r\nbear the burden. At the end of summer Pitt sent a great expedition to\r\nattack Rochefort; the military and naval commanders disagreed, and the\r\nconsequence was failure. There was no light except from far-off India,\r\nwhere Clive won the great victory of Plassey, avenged the Black Hole of\r\nCalcutta, and prepared the ruin of the French power and the undisputed\r\nascendency of England.\r\n\r\nIf the English had small cause as yet to rejoice in their own successes,\r\nthey found comfort in those of their Prussian allies. The rout of the\r\nFrench at Rossbach and of the Austrians at Leuthen spread joy through\r\ntheir island. More than this, they felt that they had found at last a\r\nleader after their own heart; and the consciousness regenerated them.\r\nFor the paltering imbecility of the old Ministry they had the\r\nunconquerable courage, the iron purpose, the unwavering faith, the\r\ninextinguishable hope, of the new one. \"England has long been in labor,\"\r\nsaid Frederic of Prussia, \"and at last she has brought forth a man.\" It\r\nwas not only that instead of weak commanders Pitt gave her strong ones;\r\nthe same men who had served her feebly under the blight of the Newcastle\r\nAdministration served her manfully and well under his robust impulsion.\r\n\"Nobody ever entered his closet,\" said Colonel Barre, \"who did not come\r\nout of it a braver man.\" That inspiration was felt wherever the British\r\nflag waved. Zeal awakened with the assurance that conspicuous merit was\r\nsure of its reward, and that no officer who did his duty would now be\r\nmade a sacrifice, like Admiral Byng, to appease public indignation at\r\nministerial failures. As Nature, languishing in chill vapors and dull\r\nsmothering fogs, revives at the touch of the sun, so did England spring\r\ninto fresh life under the kindling influence of one great man.\r\n\r\nWith the opening of the year 1758 her course of Continental victories\r\nbegan. The Duke of Cumberland, the King's son, was recalled in disgrace,\r\nand a general of another stamp, Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, was\r\nplaced in command of the Germans in British pay, with the contingent of\r\nEnglish troops now added to them. The French, too, changed commanders.\r\nThe Duke of Richelieu, a dissolute old beau, returned to Paris to spend\r\nin heartless gallantries the wealth he had gained by plunder; and a\r\nyoung soldier-churchman, the Comte de Clermont, took his place. Prince\r\nFerdinand pushed him hard with an inferior force, drove him out of\r\nHanover, and captured eleven thousand of his soldiers. Clermont was\r\nrecalled, and was succeeded by Contades, another incapable. One of his\r\nsubordinates won for him the battle; of Lutterberg; but the generalship\r\nof Ferdinand made it a barren victory, and the campaign remained a\r\nsuccess for the English. They made descents on the French coasts,\r\ncaptured; St.-Servan, a suburb of St.-Malo, and burned three ships of\r\nthe line, twenty-four privateers, and sixty merchantmen; then entered\r\nCherbourg, destroyed the forts, carried off or spiked the cannon, and\r\nburned twenty-seven vessels,--a success partially offset by a failure on\r\nthe coast of Brittany, where they were repulsed with some loss. In\r\nAfrica they drove the French from the Guinea coast, and seized their\r\nestablishment at Senegal.\r\n\r\nIt was towards America that Pitt turned his heartiest efforts. His first\r\naim was to take Louisbourg, as a step towards taking Quebec; then\r\nTiconderoga, that thorn in the side of the northern colonies; and lastly\r\nFort Duquesne, the Key of the Great West. He recalled Loudon, for whom\r\nhe had a fierce contempt; but there were influences which he could not\r\ndisregard, and Major-General Abercromby, who was next in order of rank,\r\nan indifferent soldier, though a veteran in years, was allowed to\r\nsucceed him, and lead in person the attack on Ticonderoga.[573] Pitt\r\nhoped that Brigadier Lord Howe, an admirable officer, who was joined\r\nwith Abercromby, would be the real commander, and make amends for all\r\nshort-comings of his chief. To command the Louisbourg expedition,\r\nColonel Jeffrey Amherst was recalled from the German war, and made at\r\none leap a major-general.[574] He was energetic and resolute, somewhat\r\ncautious and slow, but with a bulldog tenacity of grip. Under him were\r\nthree brigadiers, Whitmore, Lawrence, and Wolfe, of whom the youngest is\r\nthe most noteworthy. In the luckless Rochefort expedition, Colonel James\r\nWolfe was conspicuous by a dashing gallantry that did not escape the eye\r\nof Pitt, always on the watch for men to do his work. The young officer\r\nwas ardent, headlong, void of fear, often rash, almost fanatical in his\r\ndevotion to military duty, and reckless of life when the glory of\r\nEngland or his own was at stake. The third expedition, that against Fort\r\nDuquesne, was given to Brigadier John Forbes, whose qualities well\r\nfitted him for the task.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 573: _Order, War Office, 19 Dec. 1757._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 574: _Pitt to Abercromby, 27 Jan. 1758. Instructions for our\r\nTrusty and Well-beloved Jeffrey Amherst, Esq., Major-General of our\r\nForces in North America, 3 March, 1758._]\r\n\r\nDuring his first short term of office, Pitt had given a new species of\r\ntroops to the British army. These were the Scotch Highlanders, who had\r\nrisen against the House of Hanover in 1745, and would raise against it\r\nagain should France accomplish her favorite scheme of throwing a force\r\ninto Scotland to excite another insurrection for the Stuarts. But they\r\nwould be useful to fight the French abroad, though dangerous as their\r\npossible allies at home; and two regiments of them were now ordered to\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nDelay had been the ruin of the last year's attempt against Louisbourg.\r\nThis time preparation was urged on apace; and before the end of winter\r\ntwo fleets had put to sea: one, under Admiral Boscawen, was destined for\r\nLouisbourg; while the other, under Admiral Osborn, sailed for the\r\nMediterranean to intercept the French fleet of Admiral La Clue, who was\r\nabout to sail from Toulon for America. Osborn, cruising between the\r\ncoasts of Spain and Africa, barred the way to the Straits of Gibraltar,\r\nand kept his enemy imprisoned. La Clue made no attempt to force a\r\npassage; but several combats of detached ships took place, one of which\r\nis too remarkable to pass unnoticed. Captain Gardiner of the \"Monmouth,\"\r\na ship of four hundred and seventy men and sixty-four guns, engaged the\r\nFrench ship \"Foudroyant,\" carrying a thousand men and eighty-four guns\r\nof heavier metal than those of the Englishman. Gardiner had lately been\r\nreproved by Anson, First Lord of the Admiralty, for some alleged\r\nmisconduct or shortcoming, and he thought of nothing but retrieving his\r\nhonor. \"We must take her,\" he said to his crew as the \"Foudroyant\" hove\r\nin sight. \"She looks more than a match for us, but I will not quit her\r\nwhile this ship can swim or I have a soul left alive;\" and the sailors\r\nanswered with cheers. The fight was long and furious. Gardiner was\r\nkilled by a musket shot, begging his first lieutenant with his dying\r\nbreath not to haul down his flag. The lieutenant nailed it to the mast.\r\nAt length the \"Foudroyant\" ceased from thundering, struck her colors,\r\nand was carried a prize to England.[575]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 575: Entick, III. 56-60.]\r\n\r\nThe typical British naval officer of that time was a rugged sea-dog, a\r\ntough and stubborn fighter, though no more so than the politer\r\ngenerations that followed, at home on the quarter-deck, but no ornament\r\nto the drawing-room, by reason of what his contemporary, Entick, the\r\nstrenuous chronicler of the war, calls, not unapprovingly, \"the ferocity\r\nof his manners.\" While Osborn held La Clue imprisoned at Toulon, Sir\r\nEdward Hawke, worthy leader of such men, sailed with seven ships of the\r\nline and three frigates to intercept a French squadron from Rochefort\r\nconvoying a fleet of transports with troops for America. The French\r\nships cut their cables and ran for the shore, where most of them\r\nstranded in the mud, and some threw cannon and munitions overboard to\r\nfloat themselves. The expedition was broken up. Of the many ships fitted\r\nout this year for the succor of Canada and Louisbourg, comparatively few\r\nreached their destination, and these for the most part singly or by twos\r\nand threes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Admiral Boscawen with his fleet bore away for Halifax, the\r\nplace of rendezvous, and Amherst, in the ship \"Dublin,\" followed in his\r\nwake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 19\r\n\r\n1758\r\n\r\nLouisbourg\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stormy coast of Cape Breton is indented by a small land-locked bay,\r\nbetween which and the ocean lies a tongue of land dotted with a few\r\ngrazing sheep, and intersected by rows of stone that mark more or less\r\ndistinctly the lines of what once were streets. Green mounds and\r\nembankments of earth enclose the whole space, and beneath the highest of\r\nthem yawn arches and caverns of ancient masonry. This grassy solitude\r\nwas once the \"Dunkirk of America;\" the vaulted caverns where the sheep\r\nfind shelter from the ram were casemates where terrified women sought\r\nrefuge from storms of shot and shell, and the shapeless green mounds\r\nwere citadel, bastion, rampart, and glacis. Here stood Louisbourg; and\r\nnot all the efforts of its conquerors, nor all the havoc of succeeding\r\ntimes, have availed to efface it. Men in hundreds toiled for months with\r\nlever, spade, and gunpowder in the work of destruction, and for more\r\nthan a century it has served as a stone quarry; but the remains of its\r\nvast defences still tell their tale of human valor and human woe.\r\n\r\nStand on the mounds that were once the King's Bastion. The glistening\r\nsea spreads eastward three thousand miles, and its waves meet their\r\nfirst rebuff against this iron coast. Lighthouse Point is white with\r\nfoam; jets of spray spout from the rocks of Goat Island; mist curls in\r\nclouds from the seething surf that lashes the crags of Black Point, and\r\nthe sea boils like a caldron among the reefs by the harbor's mouth; but\r\non the calm water within, the small fishing vessels rest tranquil at\r\ntheir moorings. Beyond lies a hamlet of fishermen by the edge of the\r\nwater, and a few scattered dwellings dot the rough hills, bristled with\r\nstunted firs, that gird the quiet basin; while close at hand, within the\r\nprecinct of the vanished fortress, stand two small farmhouses. All else\r\nis a solitude of ocean, rock, marsh, and forest.[576]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 576: Louisbourg is described as I saw it ten days before\r\nwriting the above, after an easterly gale.]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of June, 1758, the place wore another aspect. Since the\r\npeace of Aix-la-Chapelle vast sums had been spent in repairing and\r\nstrengthening it; and Louisbourg was the strongest fortress in French or\r\nBritish America. Nevertheless it had its weaknesses. The original plan\r\nof the works had not been fully carried out; and owing, it is said, to\r\nthe bad quality of the mortar, the masonry of the ramparts was in so\r\npoor a condition that it had been replaced in some parts with fascines.\r\nThe circuit of the fortifications was more than a mile and a half, and\r\nthe town contained about four thousand inhabitants. The best buildings\r\nin it were the convent, the hospital, the King's storehouses, and the\r\nchapel and governor's quarters, which were under the same roof. Of the\r\nprivate houses, only seven or eight were of stone, the rest being humble\r\nwooden structures, suited to a population of fishermen. The garrison\r\nconsisted of the battalions of Artois, Bourgogne, Cambis, and\r\nVolontaires Étrangers, with two companies of artillery and twenty-four\r\nof colony troops from Canada,--in all three thousand and eighty regular\r\ntroops, besides officers;[577] and to these were added a body of armed\r\ninhabitants and a band of Indians. In the harbor were five ships of the\r\nline and seven frigates, carrying in all five hundred and forty-four\r\nguns and about three thousand men.[578] Two hundred and nineteen cannon\r\nand seventeen mortars were mounted on the walls and outworks.[579] Of\r\nthese last the most important were the Grand Battery on the shore of the\r\nharbor opposite its mouth, and the Island Battery on the rocky islet at\r\nits entrance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 577: _Journal du Siége de Louisbourg_. Twenty-nine hundred\r\nregulars were able to bear arms when the siege began. _Houllière,\r\nCommandant des Troupes, au Ministre, 6 Août_, 1758.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 578: Le Prudent, 74 guns; Entreprenant, 74; Capricieux, 64;\r\nCélèbre, 64; Bienfaisant, 64; Apollon, 50; Chèvre, 22; Biche, 18;\r\nFidèle, 22; Écho, 26; Aréthuse, 36; Comète, 30. The Bizarre, 64, sailed\r\nfor France on the eighth of June, and was followed by the Comète.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 579: _État d'Artillerie_, appended to the Journal of Drucour.\r\nThere were also forty-four cannon in reserve.]\r\n\r\nThe strongest front of the works was on the land side, along the base of\r\nthe peninsular triangle on which the town stood. This front, about\r\ntwelve hundred yards in extent, reached from the sea on the left to the\r\nharbor on the right, and consisted of four bastions with then-connecting\r\ncurtains, the Princess's, the Queen's, the King's, and the Dauphin's.\r\nThe King's Bastion formed part of the citadel. The glacis before it\r\nsloped down to an extensive marsh, which, with an adjacent pond,\r\ncompletely protected this part of the line. On the right, however,\r\ntowards the harbor, the ground was high enough to offer advantages to an\r\nenemy, as was also the case, to a less degree, on the left, towards the\r\nsea. The best defence of Louisbourg was the craggy shore, that, for\r\nleagues on either hand, was accessible only at a few points, and even\r\nthere with difficulty. All these points were vigilantly watched.\r\n\r\nThere had been signs of the enemy from the first opening of spring. In\r\nthe intervals of fog, rain, and snow-squalls, sails were seen hovering\r\non the distant sea; and during the latter part of May a squadron of nine\r\nships cruised off the mouth of the harbor, appearing and disappearing,\r\nsometimes driven away by gales, sometimes lost in fogs, and sometimes\r\napproaching to within cannon-shot of the batteries. Their object was to\r\nblockade the port,--in which they failed; for French ships had come in\r\nat intervals, till, as we have seen, twelve of them lay safe anchored\r\nin the harbor, with more than a year's supply of provisions for the\r\ngarrison.\r\n\r\nAt length, on the first of June, the southeastern horizon was white with\r\na cloud of canvas. The long-expected crisis was come. Drucour, the\r\ngovernor, sent two thousand regulars, with about a thousand militia and\r\nIndians, to guard the various landing-places; and the rest, aided by the\r\nsailors, remained to hold the town.[580]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 580: _Rapport de Grucour. Journal du Siége_.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of May Admiral Boscawen was at Halifax with twenty-three\r\nships of the line, eighteen frigates and fireships, and a fleet of\r\ntransports, on board of which were eleven thousand and six hundred\r\nsoldiers, all regulars, except five hundred provincial rangers.[581]\r\nAmherst had not yet arrived, and on the twenty-eighth, Boscawen, in\r\npursuance of his orders and to prevent loss of time, put to sea without\r\nhim; but scarcely had the fleet sailed out of Halifax, when they met the\r\nship that bore the expected general. Amherst took command of the troops;\r\nand the expedition held its way till the second of June, when they saw\r\nthe rocky shore-line of Cape Breton, and descried the masts of the\r\nFrench squadron in the harbor of Louisbourg.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 581: Of this force, according to Mante, only 9,900 were fit\r\nfor duty. The table printed by Knox (I. 127) shows a total of 11,112,\r\nbesides officers, artillery, and rangers. The _Authentic Account of the\r\nReduction of Louisbourg, by a Spectator_, puts the force at 11,326 men,\r\nbesides officers. Entick makes the whole 11,936.]\r\n\r\nBoscawen sailed into Gabarus Bay. The sea was rough; but in the\r\nafternoon Amherst, Lawrence, and Wolfe, with a number of naval officers,\r\nreconnoitred the shore in boats, coasting it for miles, and approaching\r\nit as near as the French batteries would permit. The rocks were white\r\nwith surf, and every accessible point was strongly guarded. Boscawen saw\r\nlittle chance of success. He sent for his captains, and consulted them\r\nseparately. They thought, like him, that it would be rash to attempt a\r\nlanding, and proposed a council of war. One of them alone, an old sea\r\nofficer named Ferguson advised his commander to take the responsibility\r\nhimself, hold no council, and make the attempt at every risk. Boscawen\r\ntook his advice, and declared that he would not leave Gabarus Bay till\r\nhe had fulfilled his instructions and set the troops on shore.[582]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 582: Entick, III. 224.]\r\n\r\nWest of Louisbourg there were three accessible places, Freshwater Cove,\r\nfour miles from the town, and Flat Point, and White Point, which were\r\nnearer, the last being within a mile of the fortifications. East of the\r\ntown there was an inlet called Lorambec, also available for landing. In\r\norder to distract the attention of the enemy, it was resolved to\r\nthreaten all these places, and to form the troops into three divisions,\r\ntwo of which, under Lawrence and Whitmore, were to advance towards Flat\r\nPoint and White Point, while a detached regiment was to make a feint at\r\nLorambec. Wolfe, with the third division, was to make the real attack\r\nand try to force a landing at Freshwater Cove, which, as it proved, was\r\nthe most strongly defended of all. When on shore Wolfe was an habitual\r\ninvalid, and when at sea every heave of the ship made him wretched; but\r\nhis ardor was unquenchable. Before leaving England he wrote to a friend:\r\n\"Being of the profession of arms, I would seek all occasions to serve;\r\nand therefore have thrown myself in the way of the American war, though\r\nI know that the very passage threatens my life, and that my constitution\r\nmust be utterly ruined and undone.\"\r\n\r\nOn the next day, the third, the surf was so high that nothing could be\r\nattempted. On the fourth there was a thick fog and a gale. The frigate\r\n\"Trent\" struck on a rock, and some of the transports were near being\r\nstranded. On the fifth there was another fog and a raging surf. On the\r\nsixth there was fog, with rain in the morning and better weather towards\r\nnoon, whereupon the signal was made and the troops entered the boats;\r\nbut the sea rose again, and they were ordered back to the ships. On the\r\nseventh more fog and more surf till night, when the sea grew calmer, and\r\norders were given for another attempt. At two in the morning of the\r\neighth the troops were in the boats again. At daybreak the frigates of\r\nthe squadron, anchoring before each point of real or pretended attack,\r\nopened a fierce cannonade on the French intrenchments; and, a quarter of\r\nan hour after, the three divisions rowed towards the shore. That of the\r\nleft, under Wolfe, consisted of four companies of grenadiers, with the\r\nlight infantry and New England rangers, followed and supported by\r\nFraser's Highlanders and eight more companies of grenadiers. They pulled\r\nfor Freshwater Cove. Here there was a crescent-shaped beach, a quarter\r\nof a mile long, with rocks at each end. On the shore above, about a\r\nthousand Frenchmen, under Lieutenant-Colonel de Saint-Julien, lay behind\r\nentrenchments covered in front by spruce and fir trees, felled and laid\r\non the ground with the tops outward.[583] Eight cannon and swivels were\r\nplanted to sweep every part of the beach and its approaches, and these\r\npieces were masked by young evergreens stuck in the ground before them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 583: Drucour reports 985 soldiers as stationed here under\r\nSaint-Julien there were also some Indians. Freshwater Cove, otherwise\r\nKennington Cove, was called La Cormorandière by the French.]\r\n\r\nThe English were allowed to come within close range unmolested. Then the\r\nbatteries opened, and a deadly storm of grape and musketry was poured\r\nupon the boats. It was clear in an instant that to advance farther would\r\nbe destruction; and Wolfe waved his hand as a signal to sheer off. At\r\nsome distance on the right, and little exposed to the fire, were three\r\nboats of light infantry under Lieutenants Hopkins and Brown and Ensign\r\nGrant; who, mistaking the signal or wilfully misinterpreting it, made\r\ndirectly for the shore before them. It was a few roads east of the\r\nbeach; a craggy coast and a strand strewn with rocks and lashed with\r\nbreakers, but sheltered from the cannon by a small projecting point. The\r\nthree officers leaped ashore, followed by their men. Wolfe saw the\r\nmovement, and hastened to support it. The boat of Major Scott, who\r\ncommanded the light infantry and rangers, next came up, and was stove in\r\nan instant; but Scott gained the shore, climbed the crags, and found\r\nhimself with ten men in front of some seventy French and Indians. Half\r\nhis followers were killed and wounded, and three bullets were shot\r\nthrough his clothes; but with admirable gallantry he held his ground\r\ntill others came to his aid.[584] The remaining boats now reached the\r\nlanding. Many were stove among the rocks, and others were overset; some\r\nof the men were dragged back by the surf and drowned; some lost their\r\nmuskets, and were drenched to the skin: but the greater part got safe\r\nashore. Among the foremost was seen the tall, attenuated form of\r\nBrigadier Wolfe, armed with nothing but a cane, as he leaped into the\r\nsurf and climbed the crags with his soldiers. As they reached the top\r\nthey formed in compact order, and attacked and carried with the bayonet\r\nthe nearest French battery, a few rods distant. The division of\r\nLawrence soon came up; and as the attention of the enemy was now\r\ndistracted, they made their landing with little opposition at the\r\nfarther end of the beach whither they were followed by Amherst himself.\r\nThe French, attacked on right and left, and fearing, with good reason,\r\nthat they would be cut off from the town, abandoned all their cannon and\r\nfled into the woods. About seventy of them were captured and fifty\r\nkilled. The rest, circling among the hills and around the marshes, made\r\ntheir way to Louisbourg, and those at the intermediate posts joined\r\ntheir flight. The English followed through a matted growth of firs till\r\nthey reached the cleared ground; when the cannon, opening on them from\r\nthe ramparts, stopped the pursuit. The first move of the great game was\r\nplayed and won.[585]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 584: Pichon, _Mémoires du Cap-Breton_, 284.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 585: _Journal of Amherst_, in Mante, 117. _Amherst to Pitt, 11\r\nJune, 1758_. _Authentic Account of the Reduction of Louisbourg, by a\r\nSpectator_, 11. _General Orders of Amherst, 3-7 June, 1759. Letter from\r\nan Officer_, in Knox, I. 191; Entick, III. 225. The French accounts\r\ngenerally agree in essentials with the English. The English lost one\r\nhundred and nine, killed, wounded, and drowned.]\r\n\r\nAmherst made his camp just beyond range of the French cannon, and Flat\r\nPoint Cove was chosen as the landing-place of guns and stores. Clearing\r\nthe ground, making roads, and pitching tents filled the rest of the day.\r\nAt night there was a glare of flames from the direction of the town. The\r\nFrench had abandoned the Grand Battery after setting fire to the\r\nbuildings in it and to the houses and fish-stages along the shore of the\r\nharbor. During the following days stores were landed as fast as the surf\r\nwould permit: but the task was so difficult that from first to last more\r\nthan a hundred boats were stove in accomplishing it; and such was the\r\nviolence of the waves that none of the siege-guns could be got ashore\r\ntill the eighteenth. The camp extended two miles along a stream that\r\nflowed down to the Cove among the low, woody hills that curved around\r\nthe town and harbor. Redoubts were made to protect its front, and\r\nblockhouses to guard its left and rear from the bands of Acadians known\r\nto be hovering in the woods.\r\n\r\nWolfe, with twelve hundred men, made his way six or seven miles round\r\nthe harbor, took possession of the battery at Lighthouse Point which the\r\nFrench had abandoned, planted guns and mortars, and opened fire on the\r\nIsland Battery that guarded the entrance. Other guns were placed at\r\ndifferent points along the shore, and soon opened on the French ships.\r\nThe ships and batteries replied. The artillery fight raged night and\r\nday; till on the twenty-fifth the island guns were dismounted and\r\nsilenced. Wolfe then strengthened his posts, secured his communications,\r\nand returned to the main army in front of the town.\r\n\r\nAmherst had reconnoitred the ground and chosen a hillock at the edge of\r\nthe marsh, less than half a mile from the ramparts, as the point for\r\nopening his trenches. A road with an epaulement to protect it must first\r\nbe made to the spot; and as the way was over a tract of deep mud\r\ncovered with water-weeds and moss, the labor was prodigious. A thousand\r\nmen worked at it day and night under the fire of the town and ships.\r\n\r\nWhen the French looked landward from their ramparts they could see\r\nscarcely a sign of the impending storm. Behind them Wolfe's cannon were\r\nplaying busily from Lighthouse Point and the heights around the harbor;\r\nbut, before them, the broad flat marsh and the low hills seemed almost a\r\nsolitude. Two miles distant, they could descry some of the English\r\ntents; but the greater part were hidden by the inequalities of the\r\nground. On the right, a prolongation of the harbor reached nearly half a\r\nmile beyond the town, ending in a small lagoon formed by a projecting\r\nsandbar, and known as the Barachois. Near this bar lay moored the little\r\nfrigate \"Aréthuse,\" under a gallant officer named Vauquelin. Her\r\nposition was a perilous one; but so long as she could maintain it she\r\ncould sweep with her fire the ground before the works, and seriously\r\nimpede the operations of the enemy. The other naval captains were less\r\nventurous; and when the English landed, they wanted to leave the harbor\r\nand save their ships. Drucour insisted that they should stay to aid the\r\ndefence, and they complied; but soon left their moorings and anchored as\r\nclose as possible under the guns of the town, in order to escape the\r\nfire of Wolfe's batteries. Hence there was great murmuring among the\r\nmilitary officers, who would have had them engage the hostile guns at\r\nshort range. The frigate \"Écho,\" under cover of a fog, had been sent to\r\nQuebec for aid; but she was chased and captured; and, a day or two\r\nafter, the French saw her pass the mouth of the harbor with an English\r\nflag at her mast-head.\r\n\r\nWhen Wolfe had silenced the Island Battery, a new and imminent danger\r\nthreatened Louisbourg. Boscawen might enter the harbor, overpower the\r\nFrench naval force, and cannonade the town on its weakest side.\r\nTherefore Drucour resolved to sink four large ships at the entrance; and\r\non a dark and foggy night this was successfully accomplished. Two more\r\nvessels were afterwards sunk, and the harbor was then thought safe.\r\n\r\nThe English had at last finished their preparations, and were urging on\r\nthe siege with determined vigor. The landward view was a solitude no\r\nlonger. They could be seen in multitudes piling earth and fascines\r\nbeyond the hillock at the edge of the marsh. On the twenty-fifth they\r\noccupied the hillock itself, and fortified themselves there under a\r\nshower of bombs. Then they threw up earth on the right, and pushed\r\ntheir approaches towards the Barachois, in spite of a hot fire from the\r\nfrigate \"Aréthuse.\" Next they appeared on the left towards the sea about\r\na third of a mile from the Princess's Bastion. It was Wolfe, with a\r\nstrong detachment, throwing up a redoubt and opening an entrenchment.\r\nLate on the night of the ninth of July six hundred French troops sallied\r\nto interrupt the work. The English grenadiers in the trenches fought\r\nstubbornly with bayonet and sword, but were forced back to the second\r\nline, where a desperate conflict in the dark took place; and after\r\nsevere loss on both sides the French were driven back. Some days before,\r\nthere had been another sortie on the opposite side, near the Barachois,\r\nresulting in a repulse of the French and the seizure by Wolfe of a more\r\nadvanced position.\r\n\r\nVarious courtesies were exchanged between the two commanders. Drucour,\r\non occasion of a flag of truce, wrote to Amherst that there was a\r\nsurgeon of uncommon skill in Louisbourg, whose services were at the\r\ncommand of any English officer who might need them. Amherst on his part\r\nsent to his enemy letters and messages from wounded Frenchmen in his\r\nhands, adding his compliments to Madame Drucour, with an expression of\r\nregret for the disquiet to which she was exposed, begging her at the\r\nsame time to accept a gift of pineapples from the West Indies. She\r\nreturned his courtesy by sending him a basket of wine; after which\r\namenities the cannon roared again. Madame Drucour was a woman of heroic\r\nspirit. Every day she was on the ramparts, where her presence roused the\r\nsoldiers to enthusiasm; and every day with her own hand she fired three\r\ncannon to encourage them.\r\n\r\nThe English lines grew closer and closer, and their fire more and more\r\ndestructive. Desgouttes, the naval commander, withdrew the \"Aréthuse\"\r\nfrom her exposed position, where her fire had greatly annoyed the\r\nbesiegers. The shot-holes in her sides were plugged up, and in the dark\r\nnight of the fourteenth of July she was towed through the obstructions\r\nin the mouth of the harbor, and sent to France to report the situation\r\nof Louisbourg. More fortunate than her predecessor, she escaped the\r\nEnglish in a fog. Only five vessels now remained afloat in the harbor,\r\nand these were feebly manned, as the greater part of their officers and\r\ncrews had come ashore, to the number of two thousand, lodging under\r\ntents in the town, amid the scarcely suppressed murmurs of the army\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth of July news came that the partisan Boishébert was\r\napproaching with four hundred Acadians, Canadians, and Micmacs to\r\nattack the English outposts and detachments. He did little or nothing,\r\nhowever, besides capturing a few stragglers. On the sixteenth, early in\r\nthe evening, a party of English, led by Wolfe, dashed forward, drove off\r\na band of French volunteers, seized a rising ground called\r\nHauteur-de-la-Potence, or Gallows Hill, and began to entrench themselves\r\nscarcely three hundred yards from the Dauphin's Bastion. The town opened\r\non them furiously with grapeshot; but in the intervals of the firing the\r\nsound of their picks and spades could plainly be heard. In the morning\r\nthey were seen throwing up earth like moles as they burrowed their way\r\nforward; and on the twenty-first they opened another parallel, within\r\ntwo hundred yards of the rampart. Still their sappers pushed on. Every\r\nday they had more guns in position, and on right and left their fire\r\ngrew hotter. Their pickets made a lodgment along the foot of the glacis,\r\nand fired up the slope at the French in the covered way.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-first was a memorable day. In the afternoon a bomb fell on\r\nthe ship \"Célèbre\" and set her on fire. An explosion followed. The few\r\nmen on board could not save her, and she drifted from her moorings. The\r\nwind blew the flames into the rigging of the \"Entreprenant,\" and then\r\ninto that of the \"Capricieux.\" At night all three were in full blaze;\r\nfor when the fire broke out the English batteries turned on them a\r\ntempest of shot and shell to prevent it from being extinguished. The\r\nglare of the triple conflagration lighted up the town, the trenches, the\r\nharbor, and the surrounding hills, while the burning ships shot off\r\ntheir guns at random as they slowly drifted westward, and grounded at\r\nlast near the Barachois. In the morning they were consumed to the\r\nwater's edge; and of all the squadron the \"Prudent\" and the\r\n\"Bienfaisant\" alone were left.\r\n\r\nIn the citadel, of which the King's Bastion formed the front, there was\r\na large oblong stone building containing the chapel, lodgings for men\r\nand officers, and at the southern end the quarters of the Governor. On\r\nthe morning after the burning of the ships a shell fell through the roof\r\namong a party of soldiers in the chamber below, burst, and set the place\r\non fire. In half an hour the chapel and all the northern part of the\r\nbuilding were in flames; and no sooner did the smoke rise above the\r\nbastion than the English threw into it a steady shower of missiles. Yet\r\nsoldiers, sailors, and inhabitants hastened to the spot, and labored\r\ndesperately to check the fire. They saved the end occupied by Drucour\r\nand his wife, but all the rest was destroyed. Under the adjacent\r\nrampart were the casemates, one of which was crowded with wounded\r\nofficers, and the rest with women and children seeking shelter in these\r\nsubterranean dens. Before the entrances there was a long barrier of\r\ntimber to protect them from exploding shells; and as the wind blew the\r\nflames towards it, there was danger that it would take fire and\r\nsuffocate those within. They rushed out, crazed with fright, and ran\r\nhither and thither with outcries and shrieks amid the storm of iron.\r\n\r\nIn the neighboring Queen's Bastion was a large range of barracks built\r\nof wood by the New England troops after their capture of the fortress in\r\n1745. So flimsy and combustible was it that the French writers call it a\r\n\"house of cards\" and \"a paper of matches.\" Here were lodged the greater\r\npart of the garrison: but such was the danger of fire, that they were\r\nnow ordered to leave it; and they accordingly lay in the streets or\r\nalong the foot of the ramparts, under shelters of timber which gave some\r\nlittle protection against bombs. The order was well timed; for on the\r\nnight after the fire in the King's Bastion, a shell filled with\r\ncombustibles set this building also in flames. A fearful scene ensued.\r\nAll the English batteries opened upon it. The roar of mortars and\r\ncannon, the rushing and screaming of round-shot and grape, the hissing\r\nof fuses and the explosion of grenades and bombs mingled with a storm of\r\nmusketry from the covered way and trenches; while, by the glare of the\r\nconflagration, the English regiments were seen drawn up in battle array,\r\nbefore the ramparts, as if preparing for an assault.\r\n\r\nTwo days after, at one o'clock in the morning, a burst of loud cheers\r\nwas heard in the distance, followed by confused cries and the noise of\r\nmusketry, which lasted but a moment. Six hundred English sailors had\r\nsilently rowed into the harbor and seized the two remaining ships, the\r\n\"Prudent\" and the \"Bienfaisant.\" After the first hubbub all was silent\r\nfor half an hour. Then a light glowed through the thick fog that covered\r\nthe water. The \"Prudent\" was burning. Being aground with the low tide,\r\nher captors had set her on fire, allowing the men on board to escape to\r\nthe town in her boats. The flames soon wrapped her from stem to stern;\r\nand as the broad glare pierced the illumined mists, the English sailors,\r\nreckless of shot and shell, towed her companion-ship, with all on board,\r\nto a safe anchorage under Wolfe's batteries.\r\n\r\nThe position of the besieged was deplorable. Nearly a fourth of their\r\nnumber were in the hospitals; while the rest, exhausted with incessant\r\ntoil, could find no place to snatch an hour of sleep; \"and yet,\" says an\r\nofficer, \"they still show ardor.\" \"To-day,\" he again says, on the\r\ntwenty-fourth, \"the fire of the place is so weak that it is more like\r\nfuneral guns than a defence.\" On the front of the town only four cannon\r\ncould fire at all. The rest were either dismounted or silenced by the\r\nmusketry from the trenches. The masonry of the ramparts had been shaken\r\nby the concussion of their own guns; and now, in the Dauphin's and\r\nKing's bastions, the English shot brought it down in masses. The\r\ntrenches had been pushed so close on the rising grounds at the right\r\nthat a great part of the covered way was enfiladed, while a battery on a\r\nhill across the harbor swept the whole front with a flank fire. Amherst\r\nhad ordered the gunners to spare the houses of the town; but, according\r\nto French accounts, the order had little effect, for shot and shell fell\r\neverywhere. \"There is not a house in the place,\" says the Diary just\r\nquoted, \"that has not felt the effects of this formidable artillery.\r\nFrom yesterday morning till seven o'clock this evening we reckon that a\r\nthousand or twelve hundred bombs, great and small, have been thrown into\r\nthe town, accompanied all the time by the fire of forty pieces of\r\ncannon, served with an activity not often seen. The hospital and the\r\nhouses around it, which also serve as hospitals, are attacked with\r\ncannon and mortar. The surgeon trembles as he amputates a limb amid\r\ncries of _Gare la bombe!_ and leaves his patient in the midst of the\r\noperation, lest he should share his fate. The sick and wounded,\r\nstretched on mattresses, utter cries of pain, which do not cease till a\r\nshot or the bursting of a shell ends them.\"[586] On the twenty-sixth the\r\nlast cannon was silenced in front of the town, and the English batteries\r\nhad made a breach which seemed practicable for assault.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 586: Early in the siege Drucour wrote to Amherst asking that\r\nthe hospitals should be exempt from fire. Amherst answered that shot and\r\nshell might fall on any part of so small a town, but promised to insure\r\nthe sick and wounded from molestation if Drucour would send them either\r\nto the island at the mouth of the harbor, or to any of the ships, if\r\nanchored apart from the rest. The offer was declined, for reasons not\r\nstated. Drucour gives the correspondence in his Diary.]\r\n\r\nOn the day before, Drucour, with his chief officers and the engineer,\r\nFranquet, had made the tour of the covered way, and examined the state\r\nof the defences. All but Franquet were for offering to capitulate. Early\r\non the next morning a council of war was held, at which were present\r\nDrucour, Franquet, Desgouttes, naval commander, Houllière, commander of\r\nthe regulars, and the several chiefs of battalions. Franquet presented a\r\nmemorial setting forth the state of the fortifications. As it was he who\r\nhad reconstructed and repaired them, he was anxious to show the quality\r\nof his work in the best light possible; and therefore, in the view of\r\nhis auditors, he understated the effects of the English fire. Hence an\r\naltercation arose, ending in a unanimous decision to ask for terms.\r\nAccordingly, at ten o'clock, a white flag was displayed over the breach\r\nin the Dauphin's Bastion, and an officer named Loppinot was sent out\r\nwith offers to capitulate. The answer was prompt and stern: the garrison\r\nmust surrender as prisoners of war; a definite reply must be given\r\nwithin an hour; in case of refusal the place will be attacked by land\r\nand sea.[587]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 587: Mante and other English writers give the text of this\r\nreply.]\r\n\r\nGreat was the emotion in the council; and one of its members,\r\nD'Anthonay, lieutenant-colonel of the battalion of Volontaires\r\nÉtrangers, was sent to propose less rigorous terms. Amherst would not\r\nspeak with him; and jointly with Boscawen despatched this note to the\r\nGovernor:--\r\n\r\n     Sir,--We have just received the reply which it has pleased your\r\n     Excellency to make as to the conditions of the capitulation offered\r\n     you. We shall not change in the least our views regarding them. It\r\n     depends on your Excellency to accept them or not; and you will have\r\n     the goodness to give your answer, yes or no, within half an hour.\r\n     We have the honor to be, etc.,\r\n\r\n     E. BOSCAWEN.\r\n\r\n     J. AMHERST.[588]\r\n\r\n\r\n     Drucour answered as follows:--\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen,--To reply to your Excellencies in as few words as\r\n     possible, I have the honor to repeat that my position also remains\r\n     the same, and that I persist in my first resolution.\r\n\r\n     I have the honor to be, etc.,\r\n\r\n     The Chevalier de Drucour\r\n\r\n[Footnote 588: Translated from the Journal of Drucour.]\r\n\r\nIn other words, he refused the English terms, and declared his purpose\r\nto abide the assault. Loppinot was sent back to the English camp with\r\nthis note of defiance. He was no sooner gone than Prévost, the\r\nintendant, an officer of functions purely civil, brought the Governor a\r\nmemorial which, with or without the knowledge of the military\r\nauthorities, he had drawn up in anticipation of the emergency. \"The\r\nviolent resolution which the council continues to hold,\" said this\r\ndocument, \"obliges me, for the good of the state, the preservation of\r\nthe King's subjects, and the averting of horrors shocking to humanity,\r\nto lay before your eyes the consequences that may ensue. What will\r\nbecome of the four thousand souls who compose the families of this town,\r\nof the thousand or twelve hundred sick in the hospitals, and the\r\nofficers and crews of our unfortunate ships? They will be delivered over\r\nto carnage and the rage of an unbridled soldiery, eager for plunder, and\r\nimpelled to deeds of horror by pretended resentment at what has formerly\r\nhappened in Canada. Thus they will all be destroyed, and the memory of\r\ntheir fate will live forever in our colonies.... It remains, Monsieur,\"\r\ncontinues the paper, \"to remind you that the councils you have held thus\r\nfar have been composed of none but military officers. I am not surprised\r\nat their views. The glory of the King's arm and the honor of their\r\nseveral corps have inspired them. You and I alone are charged with the\r\nadministration of the colony and the care of the King's subjects who\r\ncompose it. These gentlemen, therefore, have had no regard for them.\r\nThey think only of themselves and their soldiers, whose business it is\r\nto encounter the utmost extremity of peril. It is at the prayer of an\r\nintimidated people that I lay before you the considerations specified in\r\nthis memorial.\"\r\n\r\n\"In view of these considerations,\" writes Drucour, \"joined to the\r\nimpossibility of resisting an assault, M. le Chevalier de Courserac\r\nundertook in my behalf to run after the bearer of my answer to the\r\nEnglish commander and bring it back.\" It is evident that the bearer of\r\nthe note had been in no hurry to deliver it, for he had scarcely got\r\nbeyond the fortifications when Courserac overtook and stopped him.\r\nD'Anthonay, with Duvivier, major of the battalion of Artois, and\r\nLoppinot, the first messenger, was then sent to the English camp,\r\nempowered to accept the terms imposed. An English spectator thus\r\ndescribes their arrival: \"A lieutenant-colonel came running out of the\r\ngarrison, making signs at a distance, and bawling out as loud as he\r\ncould, '_We accept! We accept!_' He was followed by two others; and they\r\nwere all conducted to General Amherst's headquarters.\"[589] At eleven\r\no'clock at night they returned with the articles of capitulation and the\r\nfollowing letter:--\r\n\r\n     Sir,--We have the honor to send your Excellency the articles of\r\n     capitulation signed.\r\n\r\n     Lieutenant-Colonel D'Anthonay has not failed to speak in behalf of\r\n     the inhabitants of the town; and it is nowise our intention to\r\n     distress them, but to give them all the aid in our power.\r\n\r\n     Your Excellency will have the goodness to sign a duplicate of the\r\n     articles and send it to us.\r\n\r\n     It only remains to assure your Excellency that we shall with great\r\n     pleasure seize every opportunity to convince your Excellency that\r\n     we are with the most perfect consideration,\r\n\r\n     Sir, your Excellency's most obedient servants,\r\n\r\n     E. BOSCAWEN. J. AMHERST.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 589: _Authentic Account of the Siege of Louisbourg, by a\r\nSpectator_.]\r\n\r\nThe articles stipulated that the garrison should be sent to England,\r\nprisoners of war, in British ships; that all artillery, arms, munitions,\r\nand stores, both in Louisbourg and elsewhere on the Island of Cape\r\nBreton, as well as on Isle St.-Jean, now Prince Edward's Island, should\r\nbe given up intact; that the gate of the Dauphin's Bastion should be\r\ndelivered to the British troops at eight o'clock in the morning; and\r\nthat the garrison should lay down their arms at noon. The victors, on\r\ntheir part, promised to give the French sick and wounded the same care\r\nas their own, and to protect private property from pillage.\r\n\r\nDrucour signed the paper at midnight, and in the morning a body of\r\ngrenadiers took possession of the Dauphin's Gate. The rude soldiery\r\npoured in, swarthy with wind and sun, and begrimed with smoke and dust;\r\nthe garrison, drawn up on the esplanade, flung down their muskets and\r\nmarched from the ground with tears of rage; the cross of St. George\r\nfloated over the shattered rampart; and Louisbourg, with the two great\r\nislands that depended on it, passed to the British Crown. Guards were\r\nposted, a stern discipline was enforced, and perfect order maintained.\r\nThe conquerors and the conquered exchanged greetings, and the English\r\ngeneral was lavish of courtesies to the brave lady who had aided the\r\ndefence so well. \"Every favor she asked was granted,\" says a Frenchman\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nDrucour and his garrison had made a gallant defence. It had been his aim\r\nto prolong the siege till it should be too late for Amherst to\r\nco-operate with Abercromby in an attack on Canada; and in this, at\r\nleast, he succeeded.\r\n\r\nFive thousand six hundred and thirty-seven officers, soldiers, and\r\nsailors were prisoners in the hands of the victors. Eighteen mortars and\r\ntwo hundred and twenty-one cannon were found in the town, along with a\r\ngreat quantity of arms, munitions, and stores.[590] At the middle of\r\nAugust such of the prisoners as were not disabled by wounds or sickness\r\nwere embarked for England, and the merchants and inhabitants were sent\r\nto France. Brigadier Whitmore, as governor of Louisbourg, remained with\r\nfour regiments to hold guard over the desolation they had made.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 590: _Account of the Guns, Mortars, Shot, Shell, etc., found\r\nin the Town of Louisbourg upon its Surrender this day_, signed _Jeffrey\r\nAmherst, 27 July, 1758._]\r\n\r\nThe fall of the French stronghold was hailed in England with noisy\r\nrapture. Addresses of congratulation to the King poured in from all the\r\ncities of the kingdom, and the captured flags were hung in St. Paul's\r\namid the roar of cannon and the shouts of the populace. The provinces\r\nshared these rejoicings. Sermons of thanksgiving resounded from\r\ncountless New England pulpits. At Newport there were fireworks and\r\nilluminations; and, adds the pious reporter, \"We have reason to believe\r\nthat Christians will make wise and religious improvement of so signal a\r\nfavor of Divine Providence.\" At Philadelphia a like display was seen,\r\nwith music and universal ringing of bells. At Boston \"a stately bonfire\r\nlike a pyramid was kindled on the top of Fort Hill, which made a lofty\r\nand prodigious blaze;\" though here certain jealous patriots protested\r\nagainst celebrating a victory won by British regulars, and not by New\r\nEngland men. At New York there was a grand official dinner at the\r\nProvince Arms in Broadway, where every loyal toast was echoed by the\r\ncannon of Fort George; and illuminations and fireworks closed the\r\nday.[591] In the camp of Abercromby at Lake George, Chaplain Cleaveland,\r\nof Bagley's Massachusetts regiment, wrote: 'The General put out orders\r\nthat the breastwork should be lined with troops, and to fire three\r\nrounds for joy, and give thanks to God in a religious way.\"[592] But\r\nnowhere did the tidings find a warmer welcome than in the small detached\r\nforts scattered through the solitudes of Nova Scotia, where the military\r\nexiles, restless from inaction, listened with greedy ears for every word\r\nfrom the great world whence they were banished. So slow were their\r\ncommunications with it that the fall of Louisbourg was known in England\r\nbefore it had reached them, all. Captain John Knox, then in garrison at\r\nAnnapolis, tells how it was greeted there more than five weeks after the\r\nevent. It was the sixth of September. A sloop from Boston was seen\r\ncoming up the bay. Soldiers and officers ran down to the wharf to ask\r\nfor news. \"Every soul,\" says Knox, \"was impatient, yet shy of asking; at\r\nlength, the vessel being come near enough to be spoken to, I called out,\r\n'What news from Louisbourg?' To which the master simply replied, and\r\nwith some gravity, 'Nothing strange.' This answer, which was so coldly\r\ndelivered, threw us all into great consternation, and we looked at each\r\nother without being able to speak; some of us even turned away with an\r\nintent to return to the fort. At length one of our soldiers, not yet\r\nsatisfied, called out with some warmth: 'Damn you, Pumpkin, isn't\r\nLouisbourg taken yet?' The poor New England man then answered: 'Taken,\r\nyes, above a month ago, and I have been there since; but if you have\r\nnever heard it before, I have got a good parcel of letters for you now.'\r\nIf our apprehensions were great at first, words are insufficient to\r\nexpress our transports at this speech, the latter part of which we\r\nhardly waited for; but instantly all hats flew off, and we made the\r\nneighboring woods resound with our cheers and huzzas for almost half an\r\nhour. The master of the sloop was amazed beyond expression, and declared\r\nhe thought we had heard of the success of our arms eastward before, and\r\nhad sought to banter him.\"[593] At night there was a grand bonfire and\r\nuniversal festivity in the fort and village.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 591: These particulars are from the provincial newspapers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 592: Cleaveland, _Journal_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 593: Knox, _Historical Journal_, I. 158.]\r\n\r\nAmherst proceeded to complete his conquest by the subjection of all the\r\nadjacent possessions of France. Major Dalling was sent to occupy Port\r\nEspagnol, now Sydney. Colonel Monckton was despatched to the Bay of\r\nFundy and the River St. John with an order \"to destroy the vermin who\r\nare settled there.\"[594] Lord Rollo, with the thirty-fifth regiment and\r\ntwo battalions of the sixtieth, received the submission of Isle\r\nSt.-Jean, and tried to remove the inhabitants,--with small success; for\r\nout of more than four thousand he could catch but seven hundred.[595]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 594: _Orders of Amherst to Wolfe, 15 Aug. 1758; Ibid, to\r\nMonckton, 24 Aug. 1758; Report of Monckton, 12 Nov. 1758._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 595: _Villejouin, commandant à l'Isle St.-Jean, au Ministre, 8\r\nSept. 1758._]\r\n\r\nThe ardent and indomitable Wolfe had been the life of the siege.\r\nWherever there was need of a quick eye, a prompt decision, and a bold\r\ndash, there his lank figure was always in the front. Yet he was only\r\nhalf pleased with what had been done. The capture of Louisbourg, he\r\nthought, should be but the prelude of greater conquests; and he had\r\nhoped that the fleet and army would sail up the St. Lawrence and attack\r\nQuebec. Impetuous and impatient by nature, and irritable with disease,\r\nhe chafed at the delay that followed the capitulation, and wrote to his\r\nfather a few days after it: \"We are gathering strawberries and other\r\nwild fruits of the country, with a seeming indifference about what is\r\ndoing in other parts of the world. Our army, however, on the continent\r\nwants our help.\" Growing more anxious, he sent Amherst a note to ask his\r\nintentions; and the General replied, \"What I most wish to do is to go\r\nto Quebec. I have proposed it to the Admiral, and yesterday he seemed to\r\nthink it impracticable.\" On which Wolfe wrote again: \"If the Admiral\r\nwill not carry us to Quebec, reinforcements should certainly be sent to\r\nthe continent without losing a moment. This damned French garrison take\r\nup our time and attention, which might be better bestowed. The\r\ntransports are ready, and a small convoy would carry a brigade to Boston\r\nor New York. With the rest of the troops we might make an offensive and\r\ndestructive war in the Bay of Fundy and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. I beg\r\npardon for this freedom, but I cannot look coolly upon the bloody\r\ninroads of those hell-hounds, the Canadians; and if nothing further is\r\nto be done, I must desire leave to quit the army.\"\r\n\r\nAmherst answered that though he had meant at first to go to Quebec with\r\nthe whole army, late events on the continent made it impossible; and\r\nthat he now thought it best to go with five or six regiments to the aid\r\nof Abercromby. He asked Wolfe to continue to communicate his views to\r\nhim, and would not hear for a moment of his leaving the army; adding, \"I\r\nknow nothing that can tend more to His Majesty's service than your\r\nassisting in it.\" Wolfe again wrote to his commander, with whom he was\r\non terms of friendship: \"An offensive, daring kind of war will awe the\r\nIndians and ruin the French. Blockhouses and a trembling defensive\r\nencourage the meanest scoundrels to attack us. If you will attempt to\r\ncut up New France by the roots, I will come with pleasure to assist.\"\r\n\r\nAmherst, with such speed as his deliberate nature would permit, sailed\r\nwith six regiments for Boston to reinforce Abercromby at Lake George,\r\nwhile Wolfe set out on an errand but little to his liking. He had orders\r\nto proceed to Gaspé, Miramichi, and other settlements on the Gulf of St.\r\nLawrence, destroy them, and disperse their inhabitants; a measure of\r\nneedless and unpardonable rigor, which, while detesting it, he executed\r\nwith characteristic thoroughness. \"Sir Charles Hardy and I,\" he wrote to\r\nhis father, \"are preparing to rob the fishermen of their nets and burn\r\ntheir huts. When that great exploit is at an end, I return to\r\nLouisbourg, and thence to England.\" Having finished the work, he wrote\r\nto Amherst: \"Your orders were carried into execution. We have done a\r\ngreat deal of mischief, and spread the terror of His Majesty's arms\r\nthrough the Gulf, but have added nothing to the reputation of them.\" The\r\ndestruction of property was great; yet, as Knox writes, \"he would not\r\nsuffer the least barbarity to be committed upon the persons of the\r\nwretched inhabitants.\"[596]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 596: \"Les Anglais ont très-bien traités les prisonniers qu'ils\r\nont faits dans cette partie\" [_Gaspé_, etc]. _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 4\r\nNov. 1758._]\r\n\r\nHe returned to Louisbourg, and sailed for England to recruit his\r\nshattered health for greater conflicts.\r\n\r\nNOTE. Four long and minute French diaries of the siege of Louisbourg are\r\nbefore me. The first, that of Drucour, covers a hundred and six folio\r\npages, and contains his correspondence with Amherst, Boscawen, and\r\nDesgouttes. The second is that of the naval captain Tourville, commander\r\nof the ship \"Capricieux,\" and covers fifty pages. The third is by an\r\nofficer of the garrison whose name does not appear. The fourth, of about\r\na hundred pages, is by another officer of the garrison, and is also\r\nanonymous. It is an excellent record of what passed each day, and of the\r\nchanging conditions, moral and physical, of the besieged. These four\r\nJournals, though clearly independent of each other, agree in nearly all\r\nessential particulars. I have also numerous letters from the principal\r\nofficers, military, naval, and civil, engaged in the defence,--Drucour,\r\nDesgouttes, Houllière, Beaussier, Marolles, Tourville, Courserac,\r\nFranquet, Villejouin, Prévost, and Querdisien. These, with various other\r\ndocuments relating to the siege, were copied from the originals in the\r\nArchives de la Marine. Among printed authorities on the French side may\r\nbe mentioned Pichon, _Lettres et Mémoires pour servir à l'Histoire du\r\nCap-Breton,_ and the _Campaign of Louisbourg_, by the Chevalier\r\nJohnstone, a Scotch Jacobite serving under Drucour.\r\n\r\nThe chief authorities on the English side are the official Journal of\r\nAmherst, printed in the _London Magazine_ and in other contemporary\r\nperiodicals, and also in Mante, _History of the Late War;_ five letters\r\nfrom Amherst to Pitt, written during the siege (Public Record Office);\r\nan excellent private Journal called _An Authentic Account of the\r\nReduction of Louisbourg, by a Spectator_, parts of which have been\r\ncopied verbatim by Entick without acknowledgement; the admirable Journal\r\nof Captain John Knox, which contains numerous letters and orders\r\nrelating to the siege; and the correspondence of Wolfe contained in his\r\nLife by Wright. Before me is the Diary of a captain or subaltern in the\r\narmy of Amherst at Louisbourg, found in the garret of an old house at\r\nWindsor, Nova Scotia, on an estate belonging in 1760 to Chief Justice\r\nDeschamps. I owe the use of it to the kindness of George Wiggins, Esq.,\r\nof Windsor, N.S. Mante gives an excellent plan of the siege operations,\r\nand another will be found in Jefferys, _Natural and Civil History of\r\nFrench Dominions in North America_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 20\r\n\r\n1758\r\n\r\nTiconderoga\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last year London called on the colonists for four thousand men.\r\nThis year Pitt asked them for twenty thousand, and promised that the\r\nKing would supply arms, ammunition, tents, and provisions, leaving to\r\nthe provinces only the raising, clothing, and pay of their soldiers; and\r\nhe added the assurance that Parliament would be asked to make some\r\ncompensation even for these.[597] Thus encouraged, cheered by the\r\nremoval of Loudon, and animated by the unwonted vigor of British\r\nmilitary preparation, the several provincial assemblies voted men in\r\nabundance, though the usual vexatious delays took place in raising,\r\nequipping, and sending them to the field. In this connection, an able\r\nEnglish writer has brought against the colonies, and especially against\r\nMassachusetts, charges which deserve attention. Viscount Bury says: \"Of\r\nall the colonies, Massachusetts was the first which discovered the\r\ndesigns of the French and remonstrated against their aggressions; of all\r\nthe colonies she most zealously promoted measures of union for the\r\ncommon defence, and made the greatest exertions in furtherance of her\r\nviews.\" But he adds that there is a reverse to the picture, and that\r\n\"this colony, so high-spirited, so warlike, and apparently so loyal,\r\nwould never move hand or foot in her own defence till certain of\r\nrepayment by the mother country.\"[598] The groundlessness of this charge\r\nis shown by abundant proofs, one of which will be enough. The Englishman\r\nPownall, who had succeeded Shirley as royal governor of the province,\r\nmade this year a report of its condition to Pitt. Massachusetts, he\r\nsays, \"has been the frontier and advanced guard of all the colonies\r\nagainst the enemy in Canada,\" and has always taken the lead in military\r\naffairs. In the three past years she has spent on the expeditions of\r\nJohnson, Winslow, and Loudon £242,356, besides about £45,000 a year to\r\nsupport the provincial government, at the same time maintaining a number\r\nof forts and garrisons, keeping up scouting-parties, and building,\r\nequipping, and manning a ship of twenty guns for the service of the\r\nKing. In the first two months of the present year, 1758, she made a\r\nfurther military outlay of £172,239. Of all these sums she has received\r\nfrom Parliament a reimbursement of only £70,117, and hence she is deep\r\nin debt; yet, in addition, she has this year raised, paid, maintained,\r\nand clothed seven thousand soldiers placed under the command of General\r\nAbercromby, besides above twenty-five hundred more serving the King by\r\nland or sea; amounting in all to about one in four of her able-bodied\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 597: _Pitt to the Colonial Governors, 30 Dec. 1757._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 598: Bury, _Exodus of the Western Nations_, II, 250, 251.]\r\n\r\nMassachusetts was extremely poor by the standards of the present day,\r\nliving by fishing, farming, and a trade sorely hampered by the British\r\nnavigation laws. Her contributions of money and men were not ordained by\r\nan absolute king, but made by the voluntary act of a free people.\r\nPownall goes on to say that her present war-debt, due within three\r\nyears, is 366,698 pounds sterling, and that to meet it she has imposed\r\non her self taxes amounting, in the town of Boston, to thirteen\r\nshillings and twopence to every pound of income from real and personal\r\nestate; that her people are in distress, that she is anxious to continue\r\nher efforts in the public cause, but that without some further\r\nreimbursement she is exhausted and helpless.[599] Yet in the next year\r\nshe incurred a new and heavy debt. In 1760 Parliament repaid her\r\n£59,575.[600] Far from being fully reimbursed, the end of the war found\r\nher on the brink of bankruptcy. Connecticut made equal sacrifices in the\r\ncommon cause,--highly to her honor, for she was little exposed to\r\ndanger, being covered by the neighboring provinces; while impoverished\r\nNew Hampshire put one in three of her able-bodied men into the\r\nfield.[601]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 599: _Pownall to Pitt, 30 Sept. 1758_ (Public Record Office,\r\n_America and West Indies_, LXXI.) \"The province of Massachusetts Bay has\r\nexerted itself with great zeal and at vast expense for the public\r\nservice.\" _Registers of Privy Council, 26 July, 1757._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 600: _Bollan, Agent of Massachusetts, to Speaker of Assembly,\r\n20 March, 1760._ It was her share of £200,000 granted to all the\r\ncolonies in the proportion of their respective efforts.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 601: _Address to His Majesty from the Governor, Council, and\r\nAssembly of New Hampshire, Jan. 1759._]\r\n\r\nIn June the combined British and provincial force which Abercromby was\r\nto lead against Ticonderoga was gathered at the head of Lake George;\r\nwhile Montcalm lay at its outlet around the walls of the French\r\nstronghold, with an army not one fourth so numerous. Vaudreuil had\r\ndevised a plan for saving Ticonderoga by a diversion into the valley of\r\nthe Mohawk under Lévis, Rigaud, and Longueuil, with sixteen hundred\r\nmen, who were to be joined by as many Indians. The English forts of that\r\nregion were to be attacked, Schenectady threatened, and the Five Nations\r\ncompelled to declare for France.[602] Thus, as the Governor gave out,\r\nthe English would be forced to cease from aggression, leave Montcalm in\r\npeace, and think only of defending themselves.[603] \"This,\" writes\r\nBougainville on the fifteenth of June, \"is what M. de Vaudreuil thinks\r\nwill happen, because he never doubts anything. Ticonderoga, which is the\r\npoint really threatened, is abandoned without support to the troops of\r\nthe line and their general. It would even be wished that they might meet\r\na reverse, if the consequences to the colony would not be too\r\ndisastrous.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 602: _Lévis au Ministre, 17 Juin, 1758. Doreil au Ministre, 16\r\nJuin, 1758. Montcalm à sa Femme, 18 Avril, 1758._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 603: _Correspondance de Vaudreuil, 1758. Livre d'Ordres, Juin,\r\n1758._]\r\n\r\nThe proposed movement promised, no doubt, great advantages; but it was\r\nnot destined to take effect. Some rangers taken on Lake George by a\r\npartisan officer named Langy declared with pardonable exaggeration that\r\ntwenty-five or thirty thousand men would attack Ticonderoga in less than\r\na fortnight. Vaudreuil saw himself forced to abandon his Mohawk\r\nexpedition, and to order Lévis and his followers, who had not yet left\r\nMontreal, to reinforce Montcalm.[604] Why they did not go at once is not\r\nclear. The Governor declares that there were not boats enough. From\r\nwhatever cause, there was a long delay, and Montcalm was left to defend\r\nhimself as he could.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 604: _Bigot au Ministre, 21 Juillet, 1758._]\r\n\r\nHe hesitated whether he should not fall back to Crown Point. The\r\nengineer, Lotbinière, opposed the plan, as did also Le Mercier.[605] It\r\nwas but a choice of difficulties, and he stayed at Ticonderoga. His\r\ntroops were disposed as they had been in the summer before; one\r\nbattalion, that of Berry, being left near the fort, while the main body,\r\nunder Montcalm himself, was encamped by the saw-mill at the Falls, and\r\nthe rest, under Bourlamaque, occupied the head of the portage, with a\r\nsmall advanced force at the landing-place on Lake George. It remained to\r\ndetermine at which of these points he should concentrate them and make\r\nhis stand against the English. Ruin threatened him in any case; each\r\nposition had its fatal weakness or its peculiar danger, and his best\r\nhope was in the ignorance or blundering of his enemy. He seems to have\r\nbeen several days in a state of indecision.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 605: _N.Y. Col. Docs._, X 893. Lotbinière's relative,\r\nVaudreuil, confirms the statement. Montcalm had not, as has been said,\r\nbegun already to fall back.]\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of the fifth of July the partisan Langy, who had again\r\ngone out to reconnoitre towards the head of Lake George, came back in\r\nhaste with the report that the English were embarked in great force.\r\nMontcalm sent a canoe down Lake Champlain to hasten Lévis to his aid,\r\nand ordered the battalion of Berry to begin a breastwork and abattis on\r\nthe high ground in front of the fort. That they were not begun before\r\nshows that he was in doubt as to his plan of defence; and that his whole\r\narmy was not now set to work at them shows that his doubt was still\r\nunsolved.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly a month since Abercromby had begun his camp at the head of\r\nLake George. Here, on the ground where Johnson had beaten Dieskau, where\r\nMontcalm had planted his batteries, and Monro vainly defended the wooden\r\nramparts of Fort William Henry, were now assembled more than fifteen\r\nthousand men; and the shores, the foot of the mountains, and the broken\r\nplains between them were studded thick with tents. Of regulars there\r\nwere six thousand three hundred and sixty-seven, officers and soldiers,\r\nand of provincials nine thousand and thirty-four.[606] To the New\r\nEngland levies, or at least to their chaplains, the expedition seemed a\r\ncrusade against the abomination of Babylon; and they discoursed in their\r\nsermons of Moses sending forth Joshua against Amalek. Abercromby, raised\r\nto his place by political influence, was little but the nominal\r\ncommander. \"A heavy man,\" said Wolfe in a letter to his father; \"an aged\r\ngentleman, infirm in body and mind,\" wrote William Parkman, a boy of\r\nseventeen, who carried a musket in a Massachusetts regiment, and kept in\r\nhis knapsack a dingy little notebook, in which he jotted down what\r\npassed each day.[607] The age of the aged gentleman was fifty-two.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 606: _Abercromby to Pitt, 12 July, 1758._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 607: Great-uncle of the writer, and son of the Rev. Ebenezer\r\nParkman, a graduate of Harvard, and minister of Westborough, Mass.]\r\n\r\nPitt meant that the actual command of the army should be in the hands of\r\nBrigadier Lord Howe,[608] and he was in fact its real chief; \"the\r\nnoblest Englishman that has appeared in my time, and the best soldier in\r\nthe British army,\" says Wolfe.[609] And he elsewhere speaks of him as\r\n\"that great man.\" Abercromby testifies to the universal respect and love\r\nwith which officers and men regarded him, and Pitt calls him \"a\r\ncharacter of ancient times; a complete model of military virtue.\"[610]\r\nHigh as this praise is, it seems to have been deserved. The young\r\nnobleman, who was then in his thirty-fourth year, had the qualities of a\r\nleader of men. The army felt him, from general to drummer-boy. He was\r\nits soul; and while breathing into it his own energy and ardor, and\r\nbracing it by stringent discipline, he broke through the traditions of\r\nthe service and gave it new shapes to suit the time and place. During\r\nthe past year he had studied the art of forest warfare, and joined\r\nRogers and his rangers in their scouting-parties, sharing all their\r\nhardships and making himself one of them. Perhaps the reforms that he\r\nintroduced were fruits of this rough self-imposed schooling. He made\r\nofficers and men throw off all useless incumbrances, cut their hair\r\nclose, wear leggings to protect them from briers, brown the barrels of\r\ntheir muskets, and carry in their knapsacks thirty pounds of meal, which\r\nthey cooked for themselves; so that, according to an admiring Frenchman,\r\nthey could live a month without their supply-trains.[611] \"You would\r\nlaugh to see the droll figure we all make,\" writes an officer. \"Regulars\r\nas well as provincials have cut their coats so as scarcely to reach\r\ntheir waists. No officer or private is allowed to carry more than one\r\nblanket and a bearskin. A small portmanteau is allowed each officer. No\r\nwomen follow the camp to wash our linen. Lord Howe has already shown an\r\nexample by going to the brook and washing his own.\"[612]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 608: Chesterfield, _Letters_, IV. 260 (ed. Mahon).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 609: _Wolfe to his Father, 7 Aug. 1758_, in Wright, 450.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 610: _Pitt to Grenville, 22 Aug. 1758_, in _Grenville Papers_,\r\nI. 262.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 611: Pouchot, _Dernière Guerre de l'Amérique_, I. 140.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 612: _Letter from Camp, 12 June, 1758_, in _Boston Evening\r\nPost._ Another, in _Boston News Letter_, contains similar statements.]\r\n\r\nHere, as in all things, he shared the lot of the soldier, and required\r\nhis officers to share it. A story is told of him that before the army\r\nembarked he invited some of them to dinner in his tent, where they found\r\nno seats but logs, and no carpet but bear-skins. A servant presently\r\nplaced on the ground a large dish of pork and peas, on which his\r\nlordship took from his pocket a sheath containing a knife and fork and\r\nbegan to cut the meat. The guests looked on in some embarrassment; upon\r\nwhich he said: \"Is it possible, gentlemen, that you have come on this\r\ncampaign without providing yourselves with what is necessary?\" And he\r\ngave each of them a sheath, with a knife and fork, like his own.\r\n\r\nYet this Lycurgus of the camp, as a contemporary calls him, is described\r\nas a man of social accomplishments rare even in his rank. He made\r\nhimself greatly beloved by the provincial officers, with many of whom he\r\nwas on terms of intimacy, and he did what he could to break down the\r\nbarriers between the colonial soldiers and the British regulars. When he\r\nwas at Alban, sharing with other high officers the kindly hospitalities\r\nof Mrs. Schuyler, he so won the heart of that excellent matron that she\r\nloved him like a son; and, though not given to such effusion, embraced\r\nhim with tears on the morning when he left her to lead his division to\r\nthe lake.[613] In Westminster Abbey may be seen the tablet on which\r\nMassachusetts pays grateful tribute to his virtues, and commemorates\r\n\"the affection her officers and soldiers bore to his command.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 613: Mrs. Grant, _Memoirs of an American Lady_, 226 (ed.\r\n1876).]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the fourth of July, baggage, stores, and ammunition\r\nwere all on board the boats, and the whole army embarked on the morning\r\nof the fifth. The arrangements were perfect. Each corps marched without\r\nconfusion to its appointed station on the beach, and the sun was\r\nscarcely above the ridge of French Mountain when all were afloat. A\r\nspectator watching them from the shore says that when the fleet was\r\nthree miles on its way, the surface of the lake at that distance was\r\ncompletely hidden from sight.[614] There were nine hundred bateaux, a\r\nhundred and thirty-five whaleboats, and a large number of heavy\r\nflatboats carrying the artillery. The whole advanced in three divisions,\r\nthe regulars in the centre, and the provincials on the flanks. Each\r\ncorps had its flags and its music. The day was fair and men and officers\r\nwere in the highest spirits.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 614: _Letter from Lake George_, in _Boston News Letter_.]\r\n\r\nBefore ten o'clock they began to enter the Narrows; and the boats of the\r\nthree divisions extended themselves into long files as the mountains\r\nclosed on either hand upon the contracted lake. From front to rear the\r\nline was six miles long. The spectacle was superb: the brightness of the\r\nsummer day; the romantic beauty of the scenery; the sheen and sparkle of\r\nthose crystal waters; the countless islets, tufted with pine, birch, and\r\nfir; the bordering mountains, with their green summits and sunny crags;\r\nthe flash of oars and glitter of weapons; the banners, the varied\r\nuniforms, and the notes of bugle, trumpet, bagpipe, and drum, answered\r\nand prolonged by a hundred woodland echoes. \"I never beheld so\r\ndelightful a prospect,\" wrote a wounded officer at Albany a fortnight\r\nafter.\r\n\r\nRogers with the rangers, and Gage with the light infantry, led the way\r\nin whaleboats, followed by Bradstreet with his corps of boatmen, armed\r\nand drilled as soldiers. Then came the main body. The central column of\r\nregulars was commanded by Lord Howe, his own regiment, the fifty-fifth,\r\nin the van, followed by the Royal Americans, the twenty-seventh,\r\nforty-fourth, forty-sixth, and eightieth infantry, and the Highlanders\r\nof the forty-second, with their major, Duncan Campbell of Inverawe,\r\nsilent and gloomy amid the general cheer, for his soul was dark with\r\nforeshadowings of death.[615] With this central column came what are\r\ndescribed as two floating castles, which were no doubt batteries to\r\ncover the landing of the troops. On the right hand and the left were the\r\nprovincials, uniformed in blue, regiment after regiment, from\r\nMassachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island.\r\nBehind them all came the bateaux, loaded with stores and baggage, and\r\nthe heavy flatboats that carried the artillery, while a rear-guard of\r\nprovincials and regulars closed the long procession.[616]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 615: See Appendix G.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 616: _Letter from Lake George_, in _Boston News Letter_. Even\r\nRogers, the ranger, speaks of the beauty of the scene.]\r\n\r\nAt five in the afternoon they reached Sabbath-Day Point, twenty-five\r\nmiles down the lake, where they stopped till late in the evening,\r\nwaiting for the baggage and artillery, which had lagged behind; and here\r\nLord Howe, lying on a bearskin by the side of the ranger, John Stark,\r\nquestioned him as to the position of Ticonderoga and its best points of\r\napproach. At about eleven o'clock they set out again, and at daybreak\r\nentered what was then called the Second Narrows; that is to say, the\r\ncontraction of the lake where it approaches its outlet. Close on their\r\nleft, ruddy in the warm sunrise, rose the vast bare face of Rogers Rock,\r\nwhence a French advanced party, under Langy and an officer named\r\nTrepezec, was watching their movements. Lord Howe, with Rogers and\r\nBradstreet, went in whaleboats to reconnoitre the landing. At the place\r\nwhich the French called the Burnt Camp, where Montcalm had embarked the\r\nsummer before, they saw a detachment of the enemy too weak to oppose\r\nthem. Their men landed and drove them off. At noon the whole army was on\r\nshore. Rogers, with a party of rangers, was ordered forward to\r\nreconnoitre, and the troops were formed for the march.\r\n\r\nFrom this part of the shore[617] a plain covered with forest stretched\r\nnorthwestward half a mile or more to the mountains behind which lay the\r\nvalley of Trout Brook. On this plain the army began its march in four\r\ncolumns, with the intention of passing round the western bank of the\r\nriver of the outlet, since the bridge over it had been destroyed.\r\nRogers, with the provincial regiments of Fitch and Lyman, led the way,\r\nat some distance before the rest. The forest was extremely dense and\r\nheavy, and so obstructed with undergrowth that it was impossible to see\r\nmore than a few yards in any direction, while the ground was encumbered\r\nwith fallen trees in every stage of decay. The ranks were broken, and\r\nthe men struggled on as they could in dampness and shade, under a canopy\r\nof boughs that the sun could scarcely pierce. The difficulty increased\r\nwhen, after advancing about a mile, they came upon undulating and broken\r\nground. They were now not far from the upper rapids of the outlet. The\r\nguides became bewildered in the maze of trunks and boughs; the marching\r\ncolumns were confused, and fell in one upon the other. They were in the\r\nstrange situation of an army lost in the woods.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 617: Between the old and new steamboat-landings, and parts\r\nadjacent.]\r\n\r\nThe advanced party of French under Langy and Trepezec, about three\r\nhundred and fifty in all, regulars and Canadians, had tried to retreat;\r\nbut before they could do so, the whole English army had passed them,\r\nlanded, and placed itself between them and their countrymen. They had no\r\nresource but to take to the woods. They seem to have climbed the steep\r\ngorge at the side of Rogers Rock and followed the Indian path that led\r\nto the valley of Trout Brook, thinking to descend it, and, by circling\r\nalong the outskirts of the valley of Ticonderoga, reach Montcalm's camp\r\nat the saw-mill. Langy was used to bushranging; but he too became\r\nperplexed in the blind intricacies of the forest. Towards the close of\r\nthe day he and his men had come out from the valley of Trout Brook, and\r\nwere near the junction of that stream with the river of the outlet, in a\r\nstate of some anxiety, for they could see nothing but brown trunks and\r\ngreen boughs. Could any of them have climbed one of the great pines that\r\nhere and there reared their shaggy spires high above the surrounding\r\nforest, they would have discovered where they were, but would have\r\ngained not the faintest knowledge of the enemy. Out of the woods on the\r\nright they would have seen a smoke rising from the burning huts of the\r\nFrench camp at the head of the portage, which Bourlamaque had set on\r\nfire and abandoned. At a mile or more in front, the saw-mill at the\r\nFalls might perhaps have been descried, and, by glimpses between the\r\ntrees, the tents of the neighboring camp where Montcalm still lay with\r\nhis main force. All the rest seemed lonely as the grave; mountain and\r\nvalley lay wrapped in primeval woods, and none could have dreamed that,\r\nnot far distant, an army was groping its way, buried in foliage; no\r\nrumbling of wagons and artillery trains, for none were there; all silent\r\nbut the cawing of some crow flapping his black wings over the sea of\r\ntree-tops.\r\n\r\nLord Howe, with Major Israel Putnam and two hundred rangers, was at the\r\nhead of the principal column, which was a little in advance of the three\r\nothers. Suddenly the challenge, _Qui vive!_ rang sharply from the\r\nthickets in front. _Français!_ was the reply. Langy's men were not\r\ndeceived; they fired out of the bushes. The shots were returned; a hot\r\nskirmish followed; and Lord Howe dropped dead, shot through the breast.\r\nAll was confusion. The dull, vicious reports of musketry in thick woods,\r\nat first few and scattering, then in fierce and rapid volleys, reached\r\nthe troops behind. They could hear, but see nothing. Already harassed\r\nand perplexed, they became perturbed. For all they knew, Montcalm's\r\nwhole army was upon them. Nothing prevented a panic but the steadiness\r\nof the rangers, who maintained the fight alone till the rest came back\r\nto their senses. Rogers, with his reconnoitring party, and the regiments\r\nof Fitch and Lyman, were at no great distance in front. They all turned\r\non hearing the musketry, and thus the French were caught between two\r\nfires. They fought with desperation. About fifty of them at length\r\nescaped; a hundred and forty-eight were captured, and the rest killed or\r\ndrowned in trying to cross the rapids. The loss of the English was small\r\nin numbers, but immeasurable in the death of Howe. \"The fall of this\r\nnoble and brave officer,\" says Rogers, \"seemed to produce an almost\r\ngeneral languor and consternation through the whole army.\" \"In Lord\r\nHowe,\" writes another contemporary, Major Thomas Mante, \"the soul of\r\nGeneral Abercromby's army seemed to expire. From the unhappy moment the\r\nGeneral was deprived of his advice, neither order nor discipline was\r\nobserved, and a strange kind of infatuation usurped the place of\r\nresolution.\" The death of one man was the ruin of fifteen thousand.\r\n\r\nThe evil news was despatched to Albany, and in two or three days the\r\nmessenger who bore it passed the house of Mrs. Schuyler on the meadows\r\nabove the town. \"In the afternoon,\" says her biographer, \"a man was seen\r\ncoming from the north galloping violently without his hat. Pedrom, as he\r\nwas familiarly called, Colonel Schuyler's only surviving brother, was\r\nwith her, and ran instantly to inquire, well knowing that he rode\r\nexpress. The man galloped on, crying out that Lord Howe was killed. The\r\nmind of our good aunt had been so engrossed by her anxiety and fears for\r\nthe event impending, and so impressed with the merit and magnanimity of\r\nher favorite hero, that her wonted firmness sank under the stroke, and\r\nshe broke out into bitter lamentations. This had such an effect on her\r\nfriends and domestics that shrieks and sobs of anguish echoed through\r\nevery part of the house.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of the loss was seen at once. The army was needlessly kept\r\nunder arms all night in the forest, and in the morning was ordered back\r\nto the landing whence it came.[618] Towards noon, however, Bradstreet\r\nwas sent with a detachment of regulars and provincials to take\r\npossession of the saw-mill at the Falls, which Montcalm had abandoned\r\nthe evening before. Bradstreet rebuilt the bridges destroyed by the\r\nretiring enemy, and sent word to his commander that the way was open; on\r\nwhich Abercromby again put his army in motion, reached the Falls late in\r\nthe afternoon, and occupied the deserted encampment of the French.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 618: _Abercromby to Pitt, 12 July, 1758._]\r\n\r\nMontcalm with his main force had held this position at the Falls through\r\nmost of the preceding day, doubtful, it seems, to the last whether he\r\nshould not make his final stand there. Bourlamaque was for doing so; but\r\ntwo old officers, Bernès and Montguy, pointed out the danger that the\r\nEnglish would occupy the neighboring heights;[619] whereupon Montcalm at\r\nlength resolved to fall back. The camp was broken up at five o'clock.\r\nSome of the troops embarked in bateaux, while others marched a mile and\r\na half along the forest road, passed the place where the battalion of\r\nBerry was still at work on the breastwork begun in the morning, and made\r\ntheir bivouac a little farther on, upon the cleared ground that\r\nsurrounded the fort.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 619: Pouchot, I. 145.]\r\n\r\nThe peninsula of Ticonderoga consists of a rocky plateau, with low\r\ngrounds on each side, bordering Lake Champlain on the one hand, and the\r\noutlet of Lake George on the other. The fort stood near the end of the\r\npeninsula, which points towards the southeast. Thence, as one goes\r\nwestward, the ground declines a little, and then slowly rises, till,\r\nabout half a mile from the fort, it reaches its greatest elevation, and\r\nbegins still more gradually to decline again. Thus a ridge is formed\r\nacross the plateau between the steep declivities that sink to the low\r\ngrounds on right and left. Some weeks before, a French officer named\r\nHugues had suggested the defence of this ridge by means of an\r\nabattis.[620] Montcalm approved his plan; and now, at the eleventh hour,\r\nhe resolved to make his stand here. The two engineers, Pontleroy and\r\nDesandrouin, had already traced the outline of the works, and the\r\nsoldiers of the battalion of Berry had made some progress in\r\nconstructing them. At dawn of the seventh, while Abercromby, fortunately\r\nfor his enemy, was drawing his troops back to the landing-place, the\r\nwhole French army fell to their task.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 620: _N.Y. Col. Docs._, X. 708.]\r\n\r\nThe regimental colors were planted along the line, and the officers,\r\nstripped to the shirt, took axe in hand and labored with their men. The\r\ntrees that covered the ground were hewn down by thousands, the tops\r\nlopped off, and the trunks piled one upon another to form a massive\r\nbreastwork. The line followed the top of the ridge, along which it\r\nzig-zagged in such a manner that the whole front could be swept by\r\nflank-fires of musketry and grape. Abercromby describes the wall of logs\r\nas between eight and nine feet high;[621] in which case there must have\r\nbeen a rude _banquette_, or platform to fire from, on the inner side. It\r\nwas certainly so high that nothing could be seen over it but the crowns\r\nof the soldiers' hats. The upper tier was formed of single logs, in\r\nwhich notches were cut to serve as loopholes; and in some places sods\r\nand bags of sand were piled along the top, with narrow spaces to fire\r\nthrough.[622] From the central part of the line the ground sloped away\r\nlike a natural glacis; while at the sides, and especially on the left,\r\nit was undulating and broken. Over this whole space, to the distance of\r\na musket-shot from the works, the forest was cut down, and the trees\r\nleft lying where they fell among the stumps, with tops turned outwards,\r\nforming one vast abattis, which, as a Massachusetts officer says, looked\r\nlike a forest laid flat by a hurricane.[623] But the most formidable\r\nobstruction was immediately along the front of the breastwork, where the\r\nground was covered with heavy boughs, overlapping and interlaced, with\r\nsharpened points bristling into the face of the assailant like the\r\nquills of a porcupine. As these works were all of wood, no vestige of\r\nthem remains. The earthworks now shown to tourists as the lines of\r\nMontcalm are of later construction; and though on the same ground, are\r\nnot on the same plan.[624]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 621: _Abercromby to Harrington, 12 July, 1758._ \"At least\r\neight feet high.\" Rogers, _Journals_, 116.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 622: A Swiss officer of the Royal Americans, writing on the\r\n14th, says that there were two, and in some parts three, rows of\r\nloopholes. See the letter in _Pennsylvania Archives_, III. 472.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 623: _Colonel Oliver Partridge to his Wife, 12 July, 1758._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 624: A new line of works was begun four days after the battle,\r\nto replace the log breastwork. Malartic, _Journal. Travaux faits à\r\nCarillon, 1758_.]\r\n\r\nHere, then, was a position which, if attacked in front with musketry\r\nalone, might be called impregnable. But would Abercromby so attack it?\r\nHe had several alternatives. He might attempt the flank and rear of his\r\nenemy by way of the low grounds on the right and left of the plateau, a\r\nmovement which the precautions of Montcalm had made difficult, but not\r\nimpossible. Or, instead of leaving his artillery idle on the strand of\r\nLake George, he might bring it to the front and batter the breastwork,\r\nwhich, though impervious to musketry, was worthless against heavy\r\ncannon. Or he might do what Burgoyne did with success a score of years\r\nlater, and plant a battery on the heights of Rattlesnake Hill, now\r\ncalled Mount Defiance, which commanded the position of the French, and\r\nwhence the inside of their breastwork could be scoured with round-shot\r\nfrom end to end. Or, while threatening the French front with a part of\r\nhis army, he could march the rest a short distance through the woods on\r\nhis left to the road which led from Ticonderoga to Crown Point, and\r\nwhich would soon have brought him to the place called Five-Mile Point,\r\nwhere Lake Champlain narrows to the width of an easy rifle-shot, and\r\nwhere a battery of field-pieces would have cut off all Montcalm's\r\nsupplies and closed his only way of retreat. As the French were\r\nprovisioned for but eight days, their position would thus have been\r\ndesperate. They plainly saw the danger; and Doreil declares that had the\r\nmovement been made, their whole army must have surrendered.[625]\r\nMontcalm had done what he could; but the danger of his position was\r\ninevitable and extreme. His hope lay in Abercromby; and it was a hope\r\nwell founded. The action of the English general answered the utmost\r\nwishes of his enemy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 625: _Doreil au Ministre, 28 Juillet, 1758._ The Chevalier\r\nJohnstone thought that Montcalm was saved by Abercromby's ignorance of\r\nthe ground. A _Dialogue in Hades_ (Quebec Historical Society).]\r\n\r\nAbercromby had been told by his prisoners that Montcalm had six thousand\r\nmen, and that three thousand more were expected every hour. Therefore he\r\nwas in haste to attack before these succors could arrive. As was the\r\ngeneral, so was the army. \"I believe,\" writes an officer, \"we were one\r\nand all infatuated by a notion of carrying every obstacle by a mere\r\n_coup de mousqueterie_.\"[626] Leadership perished with Lord Howe, and\r\nnothing was left but blind, headlong valor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 626: See the letter in Knox, I. 148.]\r\n\r\nClerk, chief engineer, was sent to reconnoitre the French works from\r\nMount Defiance; and came back with the report that, to judge from what\r\nhe could see, they might be carried by assault. Then, without waiting to\r\nbring up his cannon, Abercromby prepared to storm the lines.\r\n\r\nThe French finished their breastwork and abattis on the evening of the\r\nseventh, encamped behind them, slung their kettles, and rested after\r\ntheir heavy toil. Lévis had not yet appeared; but at twilight one of his\r\nofficers, Captain Pouchot, arrived with three hundred regulars, and\r\nannounced that his commander would come before morning with a hundred\r\nmore. The reinforcement, though small, was welcome, and Lévis was a host\r\nin himself. Pouchot was told that the army was half a mile off. Thither\r\nhe repaired, made his report to Montcalm, and looked with amazement at\r\nthe prodigious amount of work accomplished in one day.[627] Lévis\r\nhimself arrived in the course of the night, and approved the arrangement\r\nof the troops. They lay behind their lines till daybreak; then the drums\r\nbeat, and they formed in order of battle.[628] The battalions of La\r\nSarre and Languedoc were posted on the left, under Bourlamaque, the\r\nfirst battalion of Berry with that of Royal Roussillon in the centre,\r\nunder Montcalm, and those of La Reine, Béarn, and Guienne on the right,\r\nunder Lévis. A detachment of volunteers occupied the low grounds between\r\nthe breastwork and the outlet of Lake George; while, at the foot of the\r\ndeclivity on the side towards Lake Champlain, were stationed four\r\nhundred and fifty colony regulars and Canadians, behind an abattis which\r\nthey had made for themselves; and as they were covered by the cannon of\r\nthe fort, there was some hope that they would check any flank movement\r\nwhich the English might attempt on that side. Their posts being thus\r\nassigned, the men fell to work again to strengthen their defences.\r\nIncluding those who came with Lévis, the total force of effective\r\nsoldiers was now thirty-six hundred.[629]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 627: Pouchot, I. 137.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 628: _Livre d'Ordres, Disposition de Défense des\r\nRetranchements, 8 Juillet, 1758_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 629: Montcalm, _Relation de la Victoire remportée à Carillon,\r\n8 Juillet, 1758_. Vaudreuil puts the number at 4,760, besides officers,\r\nwhich includes the garrison and laborers at the fort. _Vaudreuil au\r\nMinistre, 28 Juillet, 1758_.]\r\n\r\nSoon after nine o'clock a distant and harmless fire of small-arms began\r\non the slopes of Mount Defiance. It came from a party of Indians who had\r\njust arrived with Sir William Johnson, and who, after amusing themselves\r\nin this manner for a time, remained for the rest of the day safe\r\nspectators of the fight. The soldiers worked undisturbed till noon, when\r\nvolleys of musketry were heard from the forest in front. It was the\r\nEnglish light troops driving in the French pickets. A cannon was fired\r\nas a signal to drop tools and form for battle. The white uniforms lined\r\nthe breastwork in a triple row, with the grenadiers behind them as a\r\nreserve, and the second battalion of Berry watching the flanks and rear.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the English army had moved forward from its camp by the\r\nsaw-mill. First came the rangers, the light infantry, and Bradstreet's\r\narmed boatmen, who, emerging into the open space, began a spattering\r\nfire. Some of the provincial troops followed, extending from left to\r\nright, and opening fire in turn; then the regulars, who had formed in\r\ncolumns of attack under cover of the forest, advanced their solid red\r\nmasses into the sunlight, and passing through the intervals between the\r\nprovincial regiments, pushed forward to the assault. Across the rough\r\nground, with its maze of fallen trees whose leaves hung withering in the\r\nJuly sun, they could see the top of the breastwork, but not the men\r\nbehind it; when, in an instant, all the line was obscured by a gush of\r\nsmoke, a crash of exploding firearms tore the air, and grapeshot and\r\nmusket-balls swept the whole space like a tempest; \"a damnable fire,\"\r\nsays an officer who heard them screaming about his ears. The English had\r\nbeen ordered to carry the works with the bayonet; but their ranks were\r\nbroken by the obstructions through which they struggled in vain to force\r\ntheir way, and they soon began to fire in turn. The storm raged in full\r\nfury for an hour. The assailants pushed close to the breastwork; but\r\nthere they were stopped by the bristling mass of sharpened branches,\r\nwhich they could not pass under the murderous cross-fires that swept\r\nthem from front and flank. At length they fell back, exclaiming that the\r\nworks were impregnable. Abercromby, who was at the saw-mill, a mile and\r\na half in the rear, sent order to attack again, and again they came on\r\nas before.\r\n\r\nThe scene was frightful: masses of infuriated men who could not go\r\nforward and would not go back; straining for an enemy they could not\r\nreach, and firing on an enemy they could not see; caught in the\r\nentanglement of fallen trees; tripped by briers, stumbling over logs,\r\ntearing through boughs; shouting, yelling, cursing, and pelted all the\r\nwhile with bullets that killed them by scores, stretched them on the\r\nground, or hung them on jagged branches in strange attitudes of death.\r\nThe provincials supported the regulars with spirit, and some of them\r\nforced their way to the foot of the wooden wall.\r\n\r\nThe French fought with the intrepid gayety of their nation, and shouts\r\nof _Vive le Roi!_ and _Vive notre General!_ mingled with the din of\r\nmusketry. Montcalm, with his coat off, for the day was hot, directed the\r\ndefence of the centre, and repaired to any part of the line where the\r\ndanger for the time seemed greatest. He is warm in praise of his enemy,\r\nand declares that between one and seven o'clock they attacked him six\r\nsuccessive times. Early in the action Abercromby tried to turn the\r\nFrench left by sending twenty bateaux, filled with troops, down the\r\noutlet of Lake George. They were met by the fire of the volunteers\r\nstationed to defend the low grounds on that side, and, still advancing,\r\ncame within range of the cannon of the fort, which sank two of them and\r\ndrove back the rest.\r\n\r\nA curious incident happened during one of the attacks. De Bassignac, a\r\ncaptain in the battalion of Royal Roussillon, tied his handkerchief to\r\nthe end of a musket and waved it over the breastwork in defiance. The\r\nEnglish mistook it for a sign of surrender, and came forward with all\r\npossible speed, holding their muskets crossed over their heads in both\r\nhands, and crying _Quarter_. The French made the same mistake; and\r\nthinking that their enemies were giving themselves up as prisoners,\r\nceased firing, and mounted on the top of the breastwork to receive them.\r\nCaptain Pouchot, astonished, as he says, to see them perched there,\r\nlooked out to learn the cause, and saw that the enemy meant anything but\r\nsurrender. Whereupon he shouted with all his might: \"_Tirez! Tirez! Ne\r\nvoyez-vous pas que ces gens-là vont vous enlever?_\" The soldiers, still\r\nstanding on the breastwork, instantly gave the English a volley, which\r\nkilled some of them, and sent back the rest discomfited.[630]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 630: Pouchot, I. 153. Both Niles and Entick mention the\r\nincident.]\r\n\r\nThis was set to the account of Gallic treachery. \"Another deceit the\r\nenemy put upon us,\" says a military letter-writer: \"they raised their\r\nhats above the breastwork, which our people fired at; they, having\r\nloopholes to fire through, and being covered by the sods, we did them\r\nlittle damage, except shooting their hats to pieces.\"[631] In one of the\r\nlast assaults a soldier of the Rhode Island regiment, William Smith,\r\nmanaged to get through all obstructions and ensconce himself close under\r\nthe breastwork, where in the confusion he remained for a time unnoticed,\r\nimproving his advantages meanwhile by shooting several Frenchmen. Being\r\nat length observed, a soldier fired vertically down upon him and wounded\r\nhim severely, but not enough to prevent his springing up, striking at\r\none of his enemies over the top of the wall, and braining him with his\r\nhatchet. A British officer who saw the feat, and was struck by the\r\nreckless daring of the man, ordered two regulars to bring him off;\r\nwhich, covered by a brisk fire of musketry, they succeeded in doing. A\r\nletter from the camp two or three weeks later reports him as in a fair\r\nway to recover, being, says the writer, much braced and invigorated by\r\nhis anger against the French, on whom he was swearing to have his\r\nrevenge.[632]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 631: _Letter from Saratoga, 12 July, 1758_, in _New Hampshire\r\nGazette_. Compare _Pennsylvania Archives_, III. 474.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 632: _Letter from Lake George, 26 July, 1758_, in _Boston\r\nGazette_. The story is given, without much variation, in several other\r\nletters.]\r\n\r\nToward five o'clock two English columns joined in a most determined\r\nassault on the extreme right of the French, defended by the battalions\r\nof Guienne and Béarn. The danger for a time was imminent. Montcalm\r\nhastened to the spot with the reserves. The assailants hewed their way\r\nto the foot of the breastwork; and though again and again repulsed, they\r\nagain and again renewed the attack. The Highlanders fought with stubborn\r\nand unconquerable fury. \"Even those who were mortally wounded,\" writes\r\none of their lieutenants, \"cried to their companions not to lose a\r\nthought upon them, but to follow their officers and mind the honor of\r\ntheir country. Their ardor was such that it was difficult to bring them\r\noff.\"[633] Their major, Campbell of Inverawe, found his foreboding true.\r\nHe received a mortal shot, and his clansmen bore him from the field.\r\nTwenty-five of their officers were killed or wounded, and half the men\r\nfell under the deadly fire that poured from the loopholes. Captain John\r\nCampbell and a few followers tore their way through the abattis, climbed\r\nthe breastwork, leaped down among the French, and were bayoneted\r\nthere.[634]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 633: _Letter of Lieutenant William Grant_, in _Maclachlan's\r\nHighlands_, II. 340 (ed. 1875).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 634: _Ibid._, II. 339.]\r\n\r\nAs the colony troops and Canadians on the low ground were left\r\nundisturbed, Lévis sent them an order to make a sortie and attack the\r\nleft flank of the charging columns. They accordingly posted themselves\r\namong the trees along the declivity, and fired upwards at the enemy, who\r\npresently shifted their position to the right, out of the line of shot.\r\nThe assault still continued, but in vain; and at six there was another\r\neffort, equally fruitless. From this time till half-past seven a\r\nlingering fight was kept up by the rangers and other provincials, firing\r\nfrom the edge of the woods and from behind the stumps, bushes, and\r\nfallen trees in front of the lines. Its only objects were to cover their\r\ncomrades, who were collecting and bringing off the wounded, and to\r\nprotect the retreat of the regulars, who fell back in disorder to the\r\nFalls. As twilight came on, the last combatant withdrew, and none were\r\nleft but the dead. Abercromby had lost in killed, wounded, and missing,\r\nnineteen hundred and forty-four officers and men.[635] The loss of the\r\nFrench, not counting that of Langy's detachment, was three hundred and\r\nseventy-seven. Bourlamaque was dangerously wounded; Bougainville\r\nslightly; and the hat of Lévis was twice shot through.[636]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 635: See Appendix G.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 636: _Lévis au Ministre, 13 Juillet, 1758_.]\r\n\r\nMontcalm, with a mighty load lifted from his soul, passed along the\r\nlines, and gave the tired soldiers the thanks they nobly deserved. Beer,\r\nwine, and food were served out to them, and they bivouacked for the\r\nnight on the level ground between the breastwork and the fort. The enemy\r\nhad met a terrible rebuff; yet the danger was not over. Abercromby still\r\nhad more than thirteen thousand men, and he might renew the attack with\r\ncannon. But, on the morning of the ninth, a band of volunteers who had\r\ngone out to watch him brought back the report that he was in full\r\nretreat. The saw-mill at the Falls was on fire, and the last English\r\nsoldier was gone. On the morning of the tenth, Lévis, with a strong\r\ndetachment, followed the road to the landing-place, and found signs that\r\na panic had overtaken the defeated troops. They had left behind several\r\nhundred barrels of provisions and a large quantity of baggage; while in\r\na marshy place that they had crossed was found a considerable number of\r\ntheir shoes, which had stuck in the mud, and which they had not stopped\r\nto recover. They had embarked on the morning after the battle, and\r\nretreated to the head of the lake in a disorder and dejection wofully\r\ncontrasted with the pomp of their advance. A gallant army was sacrificed\r\nby the blunders of its chief.\r\n\r\nMontcalm announced his victory to his wife in a strain of exaggeration\r\nthat marks the exaltation of his mind. \"Without Indians, almost without\r\nCanadians or colony troops,--I had only four hundred,--alone with Lévis\r\nand Bourlamaque and the troops of the line, thirty-one hundred fighting\r\nmen, I have beaten an army of twenty-five thousand. They repassed the\r\nlake precipitately, with a loss of at least five thousand. This glorious\r\nday does infinite honor to the valor of our battalions. I have no time\r\nto write more. I am well, my dearest, and I embrace you.\" And he wrote\r\nto his friend Doreil: \"The army, the too-small army of the King, has\r\nbeaten the enemy. What a day for France! If I had had two hundred\r\nIndians to send out at the head of a thousand picked men under the\r\nChevalier de Lévis, not many would have escaped. Ah, my dear Doreil,\r\nwhat soldiers are ours! I never saw the like. Why were they not at\r\nLouisbourg?\"\r\n\r\nOn the morrow of his victory he caused a great cross to be planted on\r\nthe battle-field, inscribed with these lines, composed by the\r\nsoldier-scholar himself,--\r\n\r\n   \"Quid dux? quid miles? quid strata ingentia ligna?\r\n   En Signum! en victor! Deus hîc, Deus ipse triumphat.\"\r\n\r\n   \"Soldier and chief and rampart's strength are nought;\r\n   Behold the conquering Cross! 'T is God the triumph wrought.\"[637]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 637: Along with the above paraphrase I may give that of\r\nMontcalm himself, which was also inscribed on the cross:--\r\n\r\n   \"Chrétien! ce ne fut point Montcalm et la prudence,\r\n     Ces arbres renversés, ces héros, leurs exploits,\r\n   Qui des Anglais confus ont brisé l'espérance;\r\n     C'est le bras de ton Dieu, vainqueur sur cette croix.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same letter in which Montcalm sent these lines to his mother he\r\nsays: \"Je vous envoie, pour vous amuser, deux chansons sur le combat du\r\n8 Juillet, dont l'une est en style des poissardes de Paris.\" One of\r\nthese songs, which were written by soldiers after the battle, begins,--\r\n\r\n   \"Je chante des François\r\n   La valeur et la gloire,\r\n   Qui toujours sur l'Anglois\r\n   Remportent la victoire.\r\n   Ce sont des héros,\r\n   Tous nos généraux,\r\n   Et Montcalm et Lévis,\r\n   Et Bourlamaque aussi.\"\r\n\r\n   \"Mars, qui les engendra\r\n   Pour l'honneur de la France,\r\n   D'abord les anima\r\n   De sa haute vaillance,\r\n   Et les transporta\r\n   Dans le Canada,\r\n   Où l'on voit les François\r\n   Culbuter les Anglois.\"\r\n\r\nThe other effusion of the military muse is in a different strain, \"en\r\nstyle des poissardes de Paris.\" The following a specimen, given\r\n_literatim_:--\r\n\r\n   \"L'aumônier fit l'exhortation,\r\n   Puis il donnit l'absolution;\r\n   Aisément cela se peut croire.\r\n   Enfants, dit-il, animez-vous!\r\n   L'bon Dieu, sa mère, tout est pour vous.\r\n   _S--é! j'sommes catholiques. Les Anglois sont des hérétiques._\r\n\r\n\"Ce sont des chiens; à coups d'pieds, a coups d'poings faut leur casser\r\nla gueule et la mâchoire.\"\r\n\r\n   \"Soldats, officiers, généraux,\r\n   Chacun en ce jour fut héros.\r\n   Aisément cela se peut croire.\r\n   Montcalm, comme défunt Annibal,\r\n   S'montroit soldat et général.\r\n   _S--é! sil y avoit quelqu'un qui ne l'aimit point!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Je veux être un chien; à coups d'pieds, a coups d'poings, j'lui\r\ncass'rai la gueule et la mâchoire.\"\r\n\r\nThis is an allusion to Vaudreuil. On the battle of Ticonderoga, see\r\nAppendix G]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 21\r\n\r\n1758\r\n\r\nFort Frontenac\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rashness of Abercromby before the fight was matched by his\r\npoltroonery after it. Such was his terror that on the evening of his\r\ndefeat he sent an order to Colonel Cummings, commanding at Fort William\r\nHenry, to send all the sick and wounded and all the heavy artillery to\r\nNew York without delay.[638] He himself followed so closely upon this\r\ndisgraceful missive that Cummings had no time to obey it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 638: _Cunningham, aide-de-camp of Abercromby, to Cummings, 8\r\nJuly, 1758_.]\r\n\r\nThe defeated and humbled troops proceeded to reoccupy the ground they\r\nhad left a few days before in the flush of confidence and pride; and\r\nyoung Colonel Williams, of Massachusetts, lost no time in sending the\r\nmiserable story to his uncle Israel. His letter, which is dated \"Lake\r\nGeorge (sorrowful situation), July ye 11th,\" ends thus: \"I have told\r\nfacts; you may put the epithets upon them. In one word, what with\r\nfatigue, want of sleep, exercise of mind, and leaving the place we went\r\nto capture, the best part of the army is unhinged. I have told enough to\r\nmake you sick, if the relation acts on you as the facts have on me.\"\r\n\r\nIn the routed army was the sturdy John Cleaveland, minister of Ipswich,\r\nand now chaplain of Bagley's Massachusetts regiment, who regarded the\r\nretreat with a disgust that was shared by many others. \"This day,\" he\r\nwrites in his Diary, at the head of Lake George, two days after the\r\nbattle, \"wherever I went I found people, officers and soldiers,\r\nastonished that we left the French ground, and commenting on the strange\r\nconduct in coming off.\" From this time forth the provincials called\r\ntheir commander Mrs. Nabbycromby.[639] He thought of nothing but\r\nfortifying himself. \"Towards evening,\" continues the chaplain, \"the\r\nGeneral, with his Rehoboam counsellors, came over to line out a fort on\r\nthe rocky hill where our breastwork was last year. Now we begin to think\r\nstrongly that the grand expedition against Canada is laid aside, and a\r\nfoundation made totally to impoverish our country.\" The whole army was\r\nsoon intrenched. The chaplain of Bagley's, with his brother Ebenezer,\r\nchaplain of another regiment, one day walked round the camp and\r\ncarefully inspected it. The tour proved satisfactory to the militant\r\ndivines, and John Cleaveland reported to his wife: \"We have built an\r\nextraordinary good breastwork, sufficient to defend ourselves against\r\ntwenty thousand of the enemy, though at present we have not above a\r\nthird part of that number fit for duty.\" Many of the troops had been\r\nsent to the Mohawk, and others to the Hudson.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 639: Trumbull, _Hist. Connecticut_, II. 392. \"Nabby\" (Abigail)\r\nwas then a common female name in New England.]\r\n\r\nIn the regiment of which Cleaveland was chaplain there was a young\r\nsurgeon from Danvers, Dr. Caleb Rea, who also kept a copious diary, and,\r\nbeing of a serious turn, listened with edification to the prayers and\r\nexhortations to which the yeoman soldiery were daily summoned. In his\r\nzeal, he made an inquest among them for singers, and chose the most\r\nmelodious to form a regimental choir, \"the better to carry on the daily\r\nservice of singing psalms;\" insomuch that the New England camp was vocal\r\nwith rustic harmony, sincere, if somewhat nasal. These seemly\r\nobservances were not inconsistent with a certain amount of disorder\r\namong the more turbulent spirits, who, removed from the repressive\r\ninfluence of tight-laced village communities, sometimes indulged in\r\nconduct which grieved the conscientious surgeon. The rural New England\r\nof that time, with its narrowness, its prejudices, its oddities, its\r\ncombative energy, and rugged, unconquerable strength, is among the\r\nthings of the past, or lingers in remote corners where the whistle of\r\nthe locomotive is never heard. It has spread itself in swarming millions\r\nover half a continent, changing with changing conditions; and even the\r\npart of it that clings to the ancestral hive has transformed and\r\ncontinues to transform itself.\r\n\r\nThe provincials were happy in their chaplains, among whom there reigned\r\na marvellous harmony, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, and\r\nCongregationalists meeting twice a week to hold prayer-meetings\r\ntogether. \"A rare instance indeed,\" says Dr. Rea, \"and perhaps scarce\r\never was an army blessed with such a set of chaplains before.\" On one\r\noccasion, just before the fatal expedition, nine of them, after prayers\r\nand breakfast, went together to call upon the General. \"He treated us\r\nvery kindly,\" says the chaplain of Bagley's, \"and told us that he hoped\r\nwe would teach the people to do their duty and be courageous; and told\r\nus a story of a chaplain in Germany, where he was, who just before the\r\naction told the soldiers he had not time to say much, and therefore\r\nshould only say: 'Be courageous; for no cowards go to heaven.' The\r\nGeneral treated us to a bowl of punch and a bottle of wine, and then we\r\ntook our leave of him.\"[640]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 640: For the use of the Diary of Chaplain Cleaveland, as well\r\nas of his letters to his wife, I am indebted to the kindness of Miss\r\nAbby E. Cleaveland, his descendant.]\r\n\r\nWhen Cleaveland and the more gifted among his brethren preached of a\r\nSunday, officers and men of the regulars, no less than the provincials,\r\ncame to listen; yet that pious Sabbatarian, Dr. Rea, saw much to afflict\r\nhis conscience. \"Sad, sad it is to see how the Sabbath is profaned in\r\nthe camp,\" above all by \"the horrid custom of swearing, more especially\r\namong the regulars; and I can't but charge our defeat on this sin.\"\r\n\r\nIt would have been well had the harmony that prevailed among the\r\nchaplains found its counterpart among the men of the sword; but between\r\nthe British regular officers and those of the provinces there was\r\nanything but an equal brotherhood. It is true that Pitt, in the spirit\r\nof conciliation which he always showed towards the colonies, had\r\nprocured a change in the regulations concerning the relative rank of\r\nBritish and provincial officers, thus putting them in a position much\r\nnearer equality; but this, while appeasing the provincials, seems to\r\nhave annoyed the others. Till the campaign was nearly over, not a single\r\nprovincial colonel had been asked to join in a council of war; and,\r\ncomplains Cleaveland, \"they know no more of what is to be done than a\r\nsergeant, till the orders come out.\" Of the British officers, the\r\ngreater part had seen but little active service. Most of them were men\r\nof family, exceedingly prejudiced and insular, whose knowledge of the\r\nworld was limited to certain classes of their own countrymen, and who\r\nlooked down on all others, whether domestic or foreign. Towards the\r\nprovincials their attitude was one of tranquil superiority, though its\r\ntranquillity was occasionally disturbed by what they regarded as absurd\r\npretension on the part of the colony officers. One of them gave vent to\r\nhis feelings in an article in the _London Chronicle_, in which he\r\nadvanced the very reasonable proposition that \"a farmer is not to be\r\ntaken from the plough and made an officer in a day;\" and he was answered\r\nwrathfully, at great length, in the _Boston Evening Post_, by a writer\r\nsigning himself \"A New England Man.\" The provincial officers, on the\r\nother hand, and especially those of New England, being no less narrow\r\nand prejudiced, filled with a sensitive pride and a jealous local\r\npatriotism, and bred up in a lofty appreciation of the merits and\r\nimportance of their country, regarded British superciliousness with a\r\nresentment which their strong love for England could not overcome. This\r\nfeeling was far from being confined to the officers. A provincial\r\nregiment stationed at Half-Moon, on the Hudson, thought itself affronted\r\nby Captain Cruikshank, a regular officer; and the men were so incensed\r\nthat nearly half of them went off in a body. The deportment of British\r\nofficers in the Seven Years War no doubt had some part in hastening on\r\nthe Revolution.\r\n\r\nWhat with levelling Montcalm's siege works, planting palisades, and\r\ngrubbing up stumps in their bungling and laborious way, the regulars\r\nfound abundant occupation. Discipline was stiff and peremptory. The\r\nwooden horse and the whipping-post were conspicuous objects in the camp,\r\nand often in use. Caleb Rea, being tender-hearted, never went to see the\r\nlash laid on; for, as he quaintly observes, \"the cries were satisfactory\r\nto me, without the sight of the strokes.\" He and the rest of the doctors\r\nfound active exercise for such skill as they had, since fever and\r\ndysentery were making scarcely less havoc than the bullets at\r\nTiconderoga. This came from the bad state of the camps and unwholesome\r\nfood. The provincial surgeons seem to have been very little impressed\r\nwith the importance of sanitary regulations, and to have thought it\r\ntheir business not to prevent disease, but only to cure it. The one\r\ngrand essential in their eyes was a well-stocked medicine-chest, rich in\r\nexhaustless stores of rhubarb, ipecacuanha, and calomel. Even this\r\nsometimes failed. Colonel Williams reports \"the sick destitute of\r\neverything proper for them; medicine-chest empty; nothing but their\r\ndirty blankets for beds; Dr. Ashley dead, Dr. Wright gone home, low\r\nenough; Bille worn off his legs,--such is our case. I have near a\r\nhundred sick. Lost a sergeant and a private last night.\"[641] Chaplain\r\nCleaveland himself, though strong of frame, did not escape; but he found\r\nsolace in his trouble from the congenial society of a brother chaplain,\r\nMr. Emerson, of New Hampshire, \"a right-down hearty Christian minister,\r\nof savory conversation,\" who came to see him in his tent, breakfasted\r\nwith him, and joined him in prayer. Being somewhat better, he one day\r\nthought to recreate himself with the apostolic occupation of fishing.\r\nThe sport was poor; the fish bit slowly; and as he lay in his boat,\r\nstill languid with his malady, he had leisure to reflect on the\r\ncontrasted works of Providence and man,--the bright lake basking amid\r\nits mountains, a dream of wilderness beauty, and the swarms of harsh\r\nhumanity on the shore beside him, with their passions, discords, and\r\nmiseries. But it was with the strong meat of Calvinistic theology, and\r\nnot with reveries like these, that he was accustomed to nourish his\r\nmilitary flock.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 641: _Colonel William Williams to Colonel Israel Williams, 4\r\nSept. 1758_.]\r\n\r\nWhile at one end of the lake the force of Abercromby was diminished by\r\ndetachments and disease, that of Montcalm at the other was so increased\r\nby reinforcements that a forward movement on his part seemed possible.\r\nHe contented himself, however, with strengthening the fort,\r\nreconstructing the lines that he had defended so well, and sending out\r\nfrequent war-parties by way of Wood Creek and South Bay, to harass\r\nAbercromby's communications with Fort Edward. These parties, some of\r\nwhich consisted of several hundred men, were generally more or less\r\nsuccessful; and one of them, under La Corne, surprised and destroyed a\r\nlarge wagon train escorted by forty soldiers. When Abercromby heard of\r\nit, he ordered Rogers, with a strong detachment of provincials, light\r\ninfantry, and rangers, to go down the lake in boats, cross the mountains\r\nto the narrow waters of Lake Champlain, and cut off the enemy. But\r\nthough Rogers set out at two in the morning, the French retreated so\r\nfast that he arrived too late. As he was on his way back, he was met by\r\na messenger from the General with orders to intercept other French\r\nparties reported to be hovering about Fort Edward. On this he retraced\r\nhis steps, marched through the forest to where Whitehall now stands, and\r\nthence made his way up Wood Creek to old Fort Anne, a relic of former\r\nwars, abandoned and falling to decay. Here, on the neglected \"clearing\"\r\nthat surrounded the ruin, his followers encamped. They counted seven\r\nhundred in all, and consisted of about eighty rangers, a body of\r\nConnecticut men under Major Putnam, and a small regular force, chiefly\r\nlight infantry, under Captain Dalzell, the brave officer who was\r\nafterwards killed by Pontiac's warriors at Detroit.\r\n\r\nUp to this time Rogers had observed his usual caution, commanding\r\nsilence on the march, and forbidding fires at night; but, seeing no\r\nsigns of an enemy, he forgot himself; and on the following morning, the\r\neighth of August, he and Lieutenant Irwin, of the light infantry, amused\r\nthemselves by firing at a mark on a wager. The shots reached the ears of\r\nfour hundred and fifty French and Indians under the famous partisan\r\nMarin, who at once took steps to reconnoitre and ambuscade his rash\r\nenemy. For nearly a mile from the old fort the forest had formerly been\r\ncut down and burned; and Nature had now begun to reassert herself,\r\ncovering the open tract with a dense growth of bushes and saplings\r\nalmost impervious to anything but a wild-cat, had it not been traversed\r\nby a narrow Indian path. Along this path the men were forced to march in\r\nsingle file. At about seven o'clock, when the two marksmen had decided\r\ntheir bet, and before the heavy dew of the night was dried upon the\r\nbushes, the party slung their packs and set out. Putnam was in the front\r\nwith his Connecticut men; Dalzell followed with the regulars; and\r\nRogers, with his rangers, brought up the rear of the long and slender\r\nline. Putnam himself led the way, shouldering through the bushes, gun in\r\nhand; and just as the bluff yeoman emerged from them to enter the\r\nforest-growth beyond, the air was rent with yells, the thickets before\r\nhim were filled with Indians, and one of them, a Caughnawaga chief,\r\nsprang upon him, hatchet in hand. He had time to cock his gun and snap\r\nit at the breast of his assailant; but it missed fire, and he was\r\ninstantly seized and dragged back into the forest, as were also a\r\nlieutenant named Tracy and three private men. Then the firing began. The\r\nFrench and Indians, lying across the path in a semicircle, had the\r\nadvantage of position and surprise. The Connecticut men fell back among\r\nthe bushes in disorder; but soon rallied, and held the enemy in check\r\nwhile Dalzell and Rogers--the latter of whom was nearly a mile\r\nbehind--were struggling through briers and thickets to their aid. So\r\nclose was the brushwood that it was full half an hour before they could\r\nget their followers ranged in some kind of order in front of the enemy;\r\nand even then each man was forced to fight for himself as best he could.\r\nHumphreys, the biographer of Putnam, blames Rogers severely for not\r\ncoming at once to the aid of the Connecticut men; but two of their\r\ncaptains declare that he came with all possible speed; while a regular\r\nofficer present highly praised him to Abercromby for cool and\r\nofficer-like conduct.[642] As a man his deserts were small; as a\r\nbushfighter he was beyond reproach.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 642: _Letter from the Camp at Lake George, 5 Sept. 1758_,\r\nsigned by Captains Maynard and Giddings, and printed in the _Boston\r\nWeekly Advertiser_. \"Rogers deserves much to be commended.\" _Abercromby\r\nto Pitt, 19 Aug. 1758_.]\r\n\r\nAnother officer recounts from hearsay the remarkable conduct of an\r\nIndian, who sprang into the midst of the English and killed two of them\r\nwith his hatchet; then mounted on a log and defied them all. One of the\r\nregulars tried to knock him down with the butt of his musket; but though\r\nthe blow made him bleed, he did not fall, and would have killed his\r\nassailant if Rogers had not shot him dead.[643] The firing lasted about\r\ntwo hours. At length some of the Canadians gave way, and the rest of the\r\nFrench and Indians followed.[644] They broke into small parties to elude\r\npursuit, and reuniting towards evening, made their bivouac on a spot\r\nsurrounded by impervious swamps.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 643: _Thomas Barnsley to Bouquet, 7 Sept. 1758_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 644: _Doreil au Ministre, 31 Août, 1757_.]\r\n\r\nRogers remained on the field and buried all his own dead, forty-nine in\r\nnumber. Then he resumed his march to Fort Edward, carrying the wounded\r\non litters of branches till the next day, when he met a detachment\r\ncoming with wagons to his relief. A party sent out soon after for the\r\npurpose reported that they had found and buried more than a hundred\r\nFrench and Indians. From this time forward the war-parties from\r\nTiconderoga greatly relented in their activity.\r\n\r\nThe adventures of the captured Putnam were sufficiently remarkable. The\r\nIndians, after dragging him to the rear, lashed him fast to a tree so\r\nthat he could not move a limb, and a young savage amused himself by\r\nthrowing a hatchet at his head, striking it into the wood as close as\r\npossible to the mark without hitting it. A French petty officer then\r\nthrust the muzzle of his gun violently against the prisoner's body,\r\npretended to fire it at him, and at last struck him in the face with the\r\nbutt; after which dastardly proceeding he left him. The French and\r\nIndians being forced after a time to fall back, Putnam found himself\r\nbetween the combatants and exposed to bullets from both sides; but the\r\nenemy, partially recovering the ground they had lost, unbound him, and\r\nled him to a safe distance from the fight. When the retreat began, the\r\nIndians hurried him along with them, stripped of coat, waistcoat, shoes,\r\nand stockings, his back burdened with as many packs of the wounded as\r\ncould be piled upon it, and his wrists bound so tightly together that\r\nthe pain became intense. In his torment he begged them to kill him; on\r\nwhich a French officer who was near persuaded them to untie his hands\r\nand take off some of the packs, and the chief who had captured him gave\r\nhim a pair of moccasons to protect his lacerated feet. When they\r\nencamped at night, they prepared to burn him alive, stripped him naked,\r\ntied him to a tree, and gathered dry wood to pile about him. A sudden\r\nshower of rain interrupted their pastime; but when it was over they\r\nbegan again, and surrounded him with a circle of brushwood which they\r\nset on fire. As they were yelling and dancing their delight at the\r\ncontortions with which he tried to avoid the rising flames, Marin,\r\nhearing what was going on forward, broke through the crowd, and with a\r\ncourageous humanity not too common among Canadian officers, dashed aside\r\nthe burning brush, untied the prisoner, and angrily upbraided his\r\ntormentors. He then restored him to the chief who had captured him, and\r\nwhose right of property in his prize the others had failed to respect.\r\nThe Caughnawaga treated him at first with kindness; but, with the help\r\nof his tribesmen, took effectual means to prevent his escape, by laying\r\nhim on his back, stretching his arms and legs in the form of a St.\r\nAndrew's cross, and binding the wrists and ankles fast to the stems of\r\nyoung trees. This was a mode of securing prisoners in vogue among\r\nIndians from immemorial time; but, not satisfied with it, they placed\r\nbrushwood upon his body, and then laid across it the long slender stems\r\nof saplings, on the ends of which several warriors lay down to sleep, so\r\nthat the slightest movement on his part would rouse them. Thus he passed\r\na night of misery, which did not prevent him from thinking of the\r\nludicrous figure he made in the hands of the tawny Philistines.\r\n\r\nOn the next night, after a painful march, he reached Ticonderoga, where\r\nhe was questioned by Montcalm, and afterwards sent to Montreal in charge\r\nof a French officer, who showed him the utmost kindness. On arriving,\r\nwofully tattered, bruised, scorched, and torn, he found a friend in\r\nColonel Schuyler, himself a prisoner on parole, who helped him in his\r\nneed, and through whose good offices the future major-general of the\r\nContinental Army was included in the next exchange of prisoners.[645]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 645: On Putnam's adventures, Humphreys, 57 (1818). He had the\r\nstory from Putnam himself, and seems to give it with substantial\r\ncorrectness, though his account of the battle is at several points\r\nerroneous. The \"Molang\" of his account is Marin. On the battle, besides\r\nauthorities already cited, _Recollections of Thomson Maxwell_, a soldier\r\npresent (_Essex Institute_, VII. 97).

Malartic,\r\n_Journal du Régiment de Béarn_. Lévis, _Journal de la Guerre en Canada_.\r\nThe French notices of the affair are few and brief. They admit a\r\ndefeat, but exaggerate the force and the losses of the English, and\r\nunderrate their own. Malartic, however, says that Marin set out with\r\nfour hundred men, and was soon after joined by an additional number of\r\nIndians; which nearly answers to the best English accounts.]\r\n\r\nThe petty victory over Marin was followed by a more substantial success.\r\nEarly in September Abercromby's melancholy camp was cheered with the\r\ntidings that the important French post of Fort Frontenac, which\r\ncontrolled Lake Ontario, which had baffled Shirley in his attempt\r\nagainst Niagara, and given Montcalm the means of conquering Oswego, had\r\nfallen into British hands. \"This is a glorious piece of news, and may\r\nGod have all the glory of the same!\" writes Chaplain Cleaveland in his\r\nDiary. Lieutenant-Colonel Bradstreet had planned the stroke long before,\r\nand proposed it first to Loudon, and then to Abercromby. Loudon accepted\r\nit; but his successor received it coldly, though Lord Howe was warm in\r\nits favor. At length, under the pressure of a council of war, Abercromby\r\nconsented that the attempt should be made, and gave Bradstreet three\r\nthousand men, nearly all provincials. With these he made his way, up the\r\nMohawk and down the Onondaga, to the lonely and dismal spot where Oswego\r\nhad once stood. By dint of much persuasion a few Oneidas joined him;\r\nthough, like most of the Five Nations, they had been nearly lost to the\r\nEnglish through the effects of the defeat at Ticonderoga. On the\r\ntwenty-second of August his fleet of whaleboats and bateaux pushed out\r\non Lake Ontario; and, three days after, landed near the French fort. On\r\nthe night of the twenty-sixth Bradstreet made a lodgment within less\r\nthan two hundred yards of it; and early in the morning De Noyan, the\r\ncommandant, surrendered himself and his followers, numbering a hundred\r\nand ten soldiers and laborers, prisoners of war. With them were taken\r\nnine armed vessels, carrying from eight to eighteen guns, and forming\r\nthe whole French naval force on Lake Ontario. The crews escaped. An\r\nenormous quantity of provisions, naval stores, munitions, and Indian\r\ngoods intended for the supply of the western posts fell into the hands\r\nof the English, who kept what they could carry off, and burned the rest.\r\nIn the fort were found sixty cannon and sixteen mortars, which the\r\nvictors used to batter down the walls; and then, reserving a few of the\r\nbest, knocked off the trunnions of the others. The Oneidas were bent on\r\nscalping some of the prisoners. Bradstreet forbade it. They begged that\r\nhe would do as the French did,--turn his back and shut his eyes; but he\r\nforced them to abstain from all violence, and consoled them by a lion's\r\nshare of the plunder. In accordance with the orders of Abercromby, the\r\nfort was dismantled, and all the buildings in or around it burned, as\r\nwere also the vessels, except the two largest, which were reserved to\r\ncarry off some of the captured goods. Then, with boats deeply laden, the\r\ndetachment returned to Oswego; where, after unloading and burning the\r\ntwo vessels, they proceeded towards Albany, leaving a thousand of their\r\nnumber at the new fort which Brigadier Stanwix was building at the Great\r\nCarrying Place of the Mohawk.\r\n\r\nNext to Louisbourg, this was the heaviest blow that the French had yet\r\nreceived. Their command of Lake Ontario was gone. New France was cut in\r\ntwo; and unless the severed parts could speedily reunite, all the posts\r\nof the interior would be in imminent jeopardy. If Bradstreet had been\r\nfollowed by another body of men to reoccupy and rebuild Oswego, thus\r\nrecovering a harbor on Lake Ontario, all the captured French vessels\r\ncould have been brought thither, and the command of this inland sea\r\nassured at once. Even as it was, the advantages were immense. A host of\r\nsavage warriors, thus far inclined to France or wavering between the two\r\nbelligerents, stood henceforth neutral, or gave themselves to England;\r\nwhile Fort Duquesne, deprived of the supplies on which it depended,\r\ncould make but faint resistance to its advancing enemy.\r\n\r\nAmherst, with five regiments from Louisbourg, came, early in October, to\r\njoin Abercromby at Lake George, and the two commanders discussed the\r\nquestion of again attacking Ticonderoga. Both thought the season too\r\nlate. A fortnight after, a deserter brought news that Montcalm was\r\nbreaking up his camp. Abercromby followed his example. The opposing\r\narmies filed off each to its winter quarters, and only a few scouting\r\nparties kept alive the embers of war on the waters and mountains of Lake\r\nGeorge.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Brigadier Forbes was climbing the Alleghanies, hewing his way\r\nthrough the forests of western Pennsylvania, and toiling inch by inch\r\ntowards his goal of Fort Duquesne.[646]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 646: On the capture of Fort Frontenac, _Bradstreet to\r\nAbercromby_, _31 Aug. 1758_. _Impartial Account of Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nBradstreet's Expedition, by a Volunteer in the Expedition_ (London,\r\n1759).

In Virginia Washington still toiled at his\r\nhopeless task of defending with a single regiment a forest frontier of\r\nmore than three hundred miles, and in Pennsylvania the Assembly thought\r\nmore of quarrelling with their governor than of protecting the tormented\r\nsettlers. Fort Duquesne, the source of all the evil, was left\r\nundisturbed. In vain Washington urged the futility of defensive war, and\r\nthe necessity of attacking the enemy in his stronghold. His position,\r\ntrying at the best, was made more so by the behavior of Dinwiddie. That\r\ncrusty Scotchman had conceived a dislike to him, and sometimes treated\r\nhim in a manner that must have been unspeakably galling to the proud and\r\npassionate young man, who nevertheless, unconquerable in his sense of\r\npublic duty, curbed himself to patience, or the semblance of it.\r\n\r\nDinwiddie was now gone, and a new governor had taken his place. The\r\nconduct of the war, too, had changed, and in the plans of Pitt the\r\ncapture of Fort Duquesne held an important place. Brigadier John Forbes\r\nwas charged with it. He was a Scotch veteran, forty-eight years of age,\r\nwho had begun life as a student of medicine, and who ended it as an able\r\nand faithful soldier. Though a well-bred man of the world, his tastes\r\nwere simple; he detested ceremony, and dealt frankly and plainly with\r\nthe colonists, who both respected and liked him. In April he was in\r\nPhiladelphia waiting for his army, which as yet had no existence; for\r\nthe provincials were not enlisted, and an expected battalion of\r\nHighlanders had not arrived. It was the end of June before they were all\r\non the march; and meanwhile the General was attacked with a painful and\r\ndangerous malady, which would have totally disabled a less resolute man.\r\n\r\nHis force consisted of provincials from Pennsylvania, Virginia,\r\nMaryland, and North Carolina, with twelve hundred Highlanders of\r\nMontgomery's regiment and a detachment of Royal Americans, amounting in\r\nall, with wagoners and camp followers, to between six and seven thousand\r\nmen. The Royal American regiment was a new corps raised, in the\r\ncolonies, largely from among the Germans of Pennsylvania. Its officers\r\nwere from Europe; and conspicuous among them was Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nHenry Bouquet, a brave and accomplished Swiss, who commanded one of the\r\nfour battalions of which the regiment was composed. Early in July he was\r\nencamped with the advance-guard at the hamlet of Raystown, now the town\r\nof Bedford, among the eastern heights of the Alleghanies. Here his tents\r\nwere pitched in an opening of the forest by the banks of a small stream;\r\nand Virginians in hunting-shirts, Highlanders in kilt and plaid, and\r\nRoyal Americans in regulation scarlet, labored at throwing up\r\nintrenchments and palisades, while around stood the silent mountains in\r\ntheir mantles of green.\r\n\r\nNow rose the question whether the army should proceed in a direct course\r\nto Fort Duquesne, hewing a new road through the forest, or march\r\nthirty-four miles to Fort Cumberland, and thence follow the road made by\r\nBraddock. It was the interest of Pennsylvania that Forbes should choose\r\nthe former route, and of Virginia that he should choose the latter. The\r\nOld Dominion did not wish to see a highway cut for her rival to those\r\nrich lands of the Ohio which she called her own. Washington, who was\r\nthen at Fort Cumberland with a part of his regiment, was earnest for the\r\nold road; and in an interview with Bouquet midway between that place and\r\nRaystown, he spared no effort to bring him to the same opinion. But the\r\nquartermaster-general, Sir John Sinclair, who was supposed to know the\r\ncountry, had advised the Pennsylvania route; and both Bouquet and Forbes\r\nwere resolved to take it. It was shorter, and when once made would\r\nfurnish readier and more abundant supplies of food and forage; but to\r\nmake it would consume a vast amount of time and labor. Washington\r\nforetold the ruin of the expedition unless it took Braddock's road.\r\nArdent Virginian as he was, there is no cause to believe that his\r\ndecision was based on any but military reasons; but Forbes thought\r\notherwise, and found great fault with him. Bouquet did him more justice.\r\n\"Colonel Washington,\" he writes to the General, \"is filled with a\r\nsincere zeal to aid the expedition, and is ready to march with equal\r\nactivity by whatever way you choose.\"\r\n\r\nThe fate of Braddock had impressed itself on all the army, and inspired\r\na caution that was but too much needed; since, except Washington's men\r\nand a few others among the provincials, the whole, from general to\r\ndrummer-boy, were total strangers to that insidious warfare of the\r\nforest in which their enemies, red and white, had no rival. Instead of\r\nmarching, like Braddock, at one stretch for Fort Duquesne, burdened with\r\na long and cumbrous baggage-train, it was the plan of Forbes to push on\r\nby slow stages, establishing fortified magazines as he went, and at\r\nlast, when within easy distance of the fort, to advance upon it with all\r\nhis force, as little impeded as possible with wagons and packhorses. He\r\nbore no likeness to his predecessor, except in determined resolution,\r\nand he did not hesitate to embrace military heresies which would have\r\ndriven Braddock to fury. To Bouquet, in whom he placed a well-merited\r\ntrust, he wrote, \"I have been long in your opinion of equipping numbers\r\nof our men like the savages, and I fancy Colonel Burd, of Virginia, has\r\nmost of his best people equipped in that manner. In this country we must\r\nlearn the art of war from enemy Indians, or anybody else who has seen it\r\ncarried on here.\"\r\n\r\nHis provincials displeased him, not without reason; for the greater part\r\nwere but the crudest material for an army, unruly, and recalcitrant to\r\ndiscipline. Some of them came to the rendezvous at Carlisle with old\r\nprovince muskets, the locks tied on with a string; others brought\r\nfowling-pieces of their own, and others carried nothing but\r\nwalking-sticks; while many had never fired a gun in their lives.[647]\r\nForbes reported to Pitt that their officers, except a few in the higher\r\nranks, were \"an extremely bad collection of broken inn-keepers,\r\nhorse-jockeys, and Indian traders;\" nor is he more flattering towards\r\nthe men, though as to some of them he afterwards changed his mind.[648]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 647: _Correspondence of Forbes and Bouquet, July, August,\r\n1758_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 648: _Forbes to Pitt, 6 Sept. 1758_.]\r\n\r\nWhile Bouquet was with the advance at Raystown, Forbes was still in\r\nPhiladelphia, trying to bring the army into shape, and collecting\r\nprovisions, horses, and wagons; much vexed meantime by the Assembly,\r\nwhose tedious disputes about taxing the proprietaries greatly obstructed\r\nthe service. \"No sergeant or quartermaster of a regiment,\" he says, \"is\r\nobliged to look into more details than I am; and if I did not see to\r\neverything myself, we should never get out of this town.\" July had begun\r\nbefore he could reach the frontier village of Carlisle, where he found\r\neverything in confusion. After restoring some order, he wrote to\r\nBouquet: \"I have been and still am but poorly, with a cursed flux, but\r\nshall move day after to-morrow.\" He was doomed to disappointment; and it\r\nwas not till the ninth of August that he sent another letter from the\r\nsame place to the same military friend. \"I am now able to write after\r\nthree weeks of a most violent and tormenting distemper, which, thank\r\nGod, seems now much abated as to pain, but has left me as weak as a\r\nnew-born infant. However, I hope to have strength enough to set out from\r\nthis place on Friday next.\" The disease was an inflammation of the\r\nstomach and other vital organs; and when he should have been in bed,\r\nwith complete repose of body and mind, he was racked continually with\r\nthe toils and worries of a most arduous campaign.\r\n\r\nHe left Carlisle on the eleventh, carried on a kind of litter made of a\r\nhurdle slung between two horses; and two days later he wrote from\r\nShippensburg: \"My journey here from Carlisle raised my disorder and\r\npains to so intolerable a degree that I was obliged to stop, and may not\r\nget away for a day or two.\" Again, on the eighteenth: \"I am better, and\r\npartly free from the excruciating pain I suffered; but still so weak\r\nthat I can scarce bear motion.\" He lay helpless at Shippensburg till\r\nSeptember was well advanced. On the second he says: \"I really cannot\r\ndescribe how I have suffered both in body and mind of late, and the\r\nrelapses have been worse as the disappointment was greater;\" and on the\r\nfourth, still writing to Bouquet, who in the camp at Raystown was\r\nstruggling with many tribulations: \"I am sorry you have met with so many\r\ncross accidents to vex you, and have such a parcel of scoundrels as the\r\nprovincials to work with; _mais le vin est tiré_, and you must drop a\r\nlittle of the gentleman and treat them as they deserve. Seal and send\r\noff the enclosed despatch to Sir John by some sure hand. He is a very\r\nodd man, and I am sorry it has been my fate to have any concern with\r\nhim. I am afraid our army will not admit of division, lest one half meet\r\nwith a check; therefore I would consult Colonel Washington, though\r\nperhaps not follow his advice, as his behavior about the roads was\r\nnoways like a soldier. I thank my good cousin for his letter, and have\r\nonly to say that I have all my life been subject to err; but I now\r\nreform, as I go to bed at eight at night, if able to sit up so late.\"\r\n\r\nNobody can read the letters of Washington at this time without feeling\r\nthat the imputations of Forbes were unjust, and that here, as elsewhere,\r\nhis ruling motive was the public good.[649] Forbes himself, seeing the\r\nrugged and difficult nature of the country, began to doubt whether after\r\nall he had not better have chosen the old road of Braddock. He soon had\r\nan interview with its chief advocates, the two Virginia colonels,\r\nWashington and Burd, and reported the result to Bouquet, adding: \"I told\r\nthem that, whatever they thought, I had acted on the best information to\r\nbe had, and could safely say for myself, and believed I might answer for\r\nyou, that the good of the service was all we had at heart, not valuing\r\nprovincial interest, jealousies, or suspicions on single twopence.\" It\r\nmust be owned that, considering the slow and sure mode of advance which\r\nhe had wisely adopted, the old soldier was probably right in his choice;\r\nsince before the army could reach Fort Duquesne, the autumnal floods\r\nwould have made the Youghiogany and the Monongahela impassable.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 649: Besides the printed letters, there is an autograph\r\ncollection of his correspondence with Bouquet in 1758 (forming vol.\r\n21,641, _Additional Manuscripts_, British Museum). Copies of the whole\r\nare before me.]\r\n\r\nThe Sir John mentioned by Forbes was the quartermaster-general, Sir John\r\nSinclair, who had gone forward with Virginians and other troops from the\r\ncamp of Bouquet to make the road over the main range of the Alleghanies,\r\nwhence he sent back the following memorandum of his requirements:\r\n\"Pickaxes, crows, and shovels; likewise more whiskey. Send me the\r\nnewspapers, and tell my black to send me a candlestick and half a loaf\r\nof sugar.\" He was extremely inefficient; and Forbes, out of all patience\r\nwith him, wrote confidentially to Bouquet that his only talent was for\r\nthrowing everything into confusion. Yet he found fault with everybody\r\nelse, and would discharge volleys of oaths at all who met his\r\ndisapproval. From this cause or some other, Lieutenant-Colonel Stephen,\r\nof the Virginians, told him that he would break his sword rather than be\r\nlonger under his orders. \"As I had not sufficient strength,\" says\r\nSinclair, \"to take him by the neck from among his own men, I was obliged\r\nto let him have his own way, that I might not be the occasion of\r\nbloodshed.\" He succeeded at last in arresting him, and Major Lewis, of\r\nthe same regiment, took his place.\r\n\r\nThe aid of Indians as scouts and skirmishers was of the last importance\r\nto an army so weak in the arts of woodcraft, and efforts were made to\r\nengage the services of the friendly Cherokees and Catawbas, many of whom\r\ncame to the camp, where their caprice, insolence, and rapacity tried to\r\nthe utmost the patience of the commanders. That of Sir John Sinclair had\r\nalready been overcome by his dealings with the provincial authorities;\r\nand he wrote in good French, at the tail of a letter to the Swiss\r\ncolonel: \"Adieu, my dear Bouquet. The greatest curse that our Lord can\r\npronounce against the worst of sinners is to give them business to do\r\nwith provincial commissioners and friendly Indians.\" A band of sixty\r\nwarriors told Colonel Burd that they would join the army on condition\r\nthat it went by Braddock's road. \"This,\" wrote Forbes, on hearing of the\r\nproposal, \"is a new system of military discipline truly, and shows that\r\nmy good friend Burd is either made a cat's-foot of himself, or little\r\nknows me if he imagines that sixty scoundrels are to direct me in my\r\nmeasures.\"[650] Bouquet, with a pliant tact rarely seen in the born\r\nBriton, took great pains to please these troublesome allies, and went so\r\nfar as to adopt one of them as his son.[651] A considerable number\r\njoined the army; but they nearly all went off when the stock of presents\r\nprovided for them was exhausted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 650: The above extracts are from the _Bouquet and Haldimand\r\nPapers_, British Museum.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 651: _Bouquet to Forbes, 3 June, 1758._]\r\n\r\nForbes was in total ignorance of the strength and movements of the\r\nenemy. The Indians reported their numbers to be at least equal to his\r\nown; but nothing could be learned from them with certainty, by reason of\r\ntheir inveterate habit of lying. Several scouting-parties of whites were\r\ntherefore sent forward, of which the most successful was that of a young\r\nVirginian officer, accompanied by a sergeant and five Indians. At a\r\nlittle distance from the French fort, the Indians stopped to paint\r\nthemselves and practise incantations. The chief warrior of the party\r\nthen took certain charms from an otter-skin bag and tied them about the\r\nnecks of the other Indians. On that of the officer he hung the\r\notter-skin itself; while to the sergeant he gave a small packet of paint\r\nfrom the same mystic receptacle. \"He told us,\" reports the officer,\r\n\"that none of us could be shot, for those things would turn the balls\r\nfrom us; and then shook hands with us, and told us to go and fight like\r\nmen.\" Thus armed against fate, they mounted the high ground afterwards\r\ncalled Grant's Hill, where, covered by trees and bushes, they had a good\r\nview of the fort, and saw plainly that the reports of the French force\r\nwere greatly exaggerated.[652]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 652: _Journal of a Reconnoitring Party, Aug. 1758._ The writer\r\nseems to have been Ensign Chew, of Washington's regiment.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Bouquet's men pushed on the heavy work of road-making up the\r\nmain range of the Alleghanies, and, what proved far worse, the parallel\r\nmountain ridge of Laurel Hill, hewing, digging, blasting, laying\r\nfascines and gabions to support the track along the sides of steep\r\ndeclivities, or worming their way like moles through the jungle of swamp\r\nand forest. Forbes described the country to Pitt as an \"immense\r\nuninhabited wilderness, overgrown everywhere with trees and brushwood,\r\nso that nowhere can one see twenty yards.\" In truth, as far as eye or\r\nmind could reach, a prodigious forest vegetation spread its impervious\r\ncanopy over hill, valley, and plain, and wrapped the stern and awful\r\nwaste in the shadows of the tomb.\r\n\r\nHaving secured his magazines at Raystown, and built a fort there named\r\nFort Bedford, Bouquet made a forward movement of some forty miles,\r\ncrossed the main Alleghany and Laurel Hill, and, taking post on a stream\r\ncalled Loyalhannon Creek, began another depot of supplies as a base for\r\nthe final advance on Fort Duquesne, which was scarcely fifty miles\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nVaudreuil had learned from prisoners the march of Forbes, and, with his\r\nusual egotism, announced to the Colonial Minister what he had done in\r\nconsequence. \"I have provided for the safety for Fort Duquesne.\" \"I have\r\nsent reinforcements to M. de Ligneris, who commands there.\" \"I have done\r\nthe impossible to supply him with provisions, and I am now sending them\r\nin abundance, in order that the troops I may perhaps have occasion to\r\nsend to drive off the English may not be delayed.\" \"A stronger fort is\r\nneeded on the Ohio; but I cannot build one till after the peace; then I\r\nwill take care to build such a one as will thenceforth keep the English\r\nout of that country.\" Some weeks later he was less confident, and very\r\nanxious for news from Ligneris. He says that he has sent him all the\r\nsuccors he could, and ordered troops to go to his aid from Niagara,\r\nDetroit, and Illinois, as well as the militia of Detroit, with the\r\nIndians there and elsewhere in the West,--Hurons, Ottawas,\r\nPottawattamies, Miamis, and other tribes. What he fears is that the\r\nEnglish will not attack the fort till all these Indians have grown tired\r\nof waiting, and have gone home again.[653] This was precisely the\r\nintention of Forbes, and the chief object of his long delays.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 653: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, Juillet, Août, Octobre 1758._]\r\n\r\nHe had another good reason for making no haste. There was hope that the\r\nDelawares and Shawanoes, who lived within easy reach of Fort Duquesne,\r\nand who for the past three years had spread havoc throughout the English\r\nborder, might now be won over from the French alliance. Forbes wrote to\r\nBouquet from Shippensburg: \"After many intrigues with Quakers, the\r\nProvincial Commissioners, the Governor, etc., and by the downright\r\nbullying of Sir William Johnson, I hope I have now brought about a\r\ngeneral convention of the Indians.\"[654] The convention was to include\r\nthe Five Nations, the Delawares, the Shawanoes, and other tribes, who\r\nhad accepted wampum belts of invitation, and promised to meet the\r\nGovernor and Commissioners of the various provinces at the town of\r\nEaston, before the middle of September. This seeming miracle was wrought\r\nby several causes. The Indians in the French interest, always greedy for\r\npresents, had not of late got enough to satisfy them. Many of those\r\ndestined for them had been taken on the way from France by British\r\ncruisers, and the rest had passed through the hands of official knaves,\r\nwho sold the greater part for their own profit. Again, the goods\r\nsupplied by French fur-traders were few and dear; and the Indians\r\nremembered with regret the abundance and comparative cheapness of those\r\nthey had from the English before the war. At the same time it was\r\nreported among them that a British army was marching to the Ohio strong\r\nenough to drive out the French from all that country; and the Delawares\r\nand Shawanoes of the West began to waver in their attachment to the\r\nfalling cause. The eastern Delawares, living at Wyoming and elsewhere on\r\nthe upper Susquehanna, had made their peace with the English in the\r\nsummer before; and their great chief, Teedyuscung, thinking it for his\r\ninterest that the tribes of the Ohio should follow his example, sent\r\nthem wampum belts, inviting them to lay down the hatchet. The Five\r\nNations, with Johnson at one end of the Confederacy and Joncaire at the\r\nother,--the one cajoling them in behalf of England, and the other in\r\nbehalf of France,--were still divided in counsel; but even among the\r\nSenecas, the tribe most under Joncaire's influence, there was a party so\r\nfar inclined to England that, like the Delaware chief, they sent wampum\r\nto the Ohio, inviting peace. But the influence most potent in reclaiming\r\nthe warriors of the West was of a different kind. Christian Frederic\r\nPost, a member of the Moravian brotherhood, had been sent at the\r\ninstance of Forbes as an envoy to the hostile tribes from the Governor\r\nand Council of Pennsylvania. He spoke the Delaware language, knew the\r\nIndians well, had lived among them, had married a converted squaw, and,\r\nby his simplicity of character, directness, and perfect honesty, gained\r\ntheir full confidence. He now accepted his terrible mission, and calmly\r\nprepared to place himself in the clutches of the tiger. He was a plain\r\nGerman, upheld by a sense of duty and a single-hearted trust in God;\r\nalone, with no great disciplined organization to impel and support him,\r\nand no visions and illusions such as kindled and sustained the splendid\r\nheroism of the early Jesuit martyrs. Yet his errand was no whit less\r\nperilous. And here we may notice the contrast between the mission\r\nsettlements of the Moravians in Pennsylvania and those which the later\r\nJesuits and the Sulpitians had established at Caughnawaga, St. Francis,\r\nLa Présentation, and other places. The Moravians were apostles of peace,\r\nand they succeeded to a surprising degree in weaning their converts from\r\ntheir ferocious instincts and warlike habits; while the Mission Indians\r\nof Canada retained all their native fierceness, and were systematically\r\nimpelled to use their tomahawks against the enemies of the Church. Their\r\nwigwams were hung with scalps, male and female, adult and infant; and\r\nthese so-called missions were but nests of baptized savages, who wore\r\nthe crucifix instead of the medicine-bag, and were encouraged by the\r\nGovernment for purposes of war.[655]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 654: _Forbes to Bouquet, 18 Aug. 1758._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 655: Of the Hurons of the mission of Lorette, Bougainville\r\nsays: \"Ils sont toujours sauvages autant que ceux qui sont les moins\r\napprivoisés.\" And yet they had been converts under Jesuit control for\r\nmore than four generations. The case was no better at the other\r\nmissions; and at St Francis it seems to have been worse.]\r\n\r\nThe Moravian envoy made his way to the Delaware town of Kushkushkee, on\r\nBeaver Creek, northwest of Fort Duquesne, where the three chiefs known\r\nas King Beaver, Shingas, and Delaware George received him kindly, and\r\nconducted him to another town on the same stream. Here his reception was\r\ndifferent. A crowd of warriors, their faces distorted with rage,\r\nsurrounded him, brandishing knives and threatening to kill him; but\r\nothers took his part, and, order being at last restored, he read them\r\nhis message from the Governor, which seemed to please them. They\r\ninsisted, however, that he should go with them to Fort Duquesne, in\r\norder that the Indians assembled there might hear it also. Against this\r\ndangerous proposal he protested in vain. On arriving near the fort, the\r\nFrench demanded that he should be given up to them, and, being refused,\r\noffered a great reward for his scalp; on which his friends advised him\r\nto keep close by the camp-fire, as parties were out with intent to kill\r\nhim. \"Accordingly,\" says Post, \"I stuck to the fire as if I had been\r\nchained there. On the next day the Indians, with a great many French\r\nofficers, came out to hear what I had to say. The officers brought with\r\nthem a table, pens, ink, and paper. I spoke in the midst of them with a\r\nfree conscience, and perceived by their looks that they were not pleased\r\nwith what I said.\" The substance of his message was an invitation to the\r\nIndians to renew the old chain of friendship, joined with a warning that\r\nan English army was on its way to drive off the French, and that they\r\nwould do well to stand neutral.\r\n\r\nHe addressed an audience filled with an inordinate sense of their own\r\npower and importance, believing themselves greater and braver than\r\neither of the European nations, and yet deeply jealous of both. \"We have\r\nheard,\" they said, \"that the French and English mean to kill all the\r\nIndians and divide the land among themselves.\" And on this string they\r\nharped continually. If they had known their true interest, they would\r\nhave made no peace with the English, but would have united as one man to\r\nform a barrier of fire against their farther progress; for the West in\r\nEnglish hands meant farms, villages, cities, the ruin of the forest, the\r\nextermination of the game, and the expulsion of those who lived on it;\r\nwhile the West in French hands meant but scattered posts of war and\r\ntrade, with the native tribes cherished as indispensable allies.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting some days, the three tribes of the Delawares met in\r\ncouncil, and made their answer to the message brought by Post. It was\r\nworthy of a proud and warlike race, and was to the effect that since\r\ntheir brothers of Pennsylvania wished to renew the old peace-chain, they\r\non their part were willing to do so, provided that the wampum belt\r\nshould be sent them in the name, not of Pennsylvania alone, but of the\r\nrest of the provinces also.\r\n\r\nHaving now accomplished his errand, Post wished to return home; but the\r\nIndians were seized with an access of distrust, and would not let him\r\ngo. This jealousy redoubled when they saw him writing in his notebook.\r\n\"It is a troublesome cross and heavy yoke to draw this people,\" he says;\r\n\"they can punish and squeeze a body's heart to the utmost. There came\r\nsome together and examined me about what I had wrote yesterday. I told\r\nthem I writ what was my duty. 'Brothers, I tell you I am not afraid of\r\nyou. I have a good conscience before God and man. I tell you, brothers,\r\nthere is a bad spirit in your hearts, which breeds jealousy, and will\r\nkeep you ever in fear.'\" At last they let him go; and, eluding a party\r\nthat lay in wait for his scalp, he journeyed twelve days through the\r\nforest, and reached Fort Augusta with the report of his mission.[656]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 656: _Journal of Christian Frederic Post, July, August,\r\nSeptember, 1758._]\r\n\r\nAs the result of it, a great convention of white men and red was held at\r\nEaston in October. The neighboring provinces had been asked to send\r\ntheir delegates, and some of them did so; while belts of invitation were\r\nsent to the Indians far and near. Sir William Johnson, for reasons best\r\nknown to himself, at first opposed the plan; but was afterwards led to\r\nfavor it and to induce tribes under his influence to join in the grand\r\npacification. The Five Nations, with the smaller tribes lately admitted\r\ninto their confederacy, the Delawares of the Susquehanna, the Mohegans,\r\nand several kindred bands, all had their representatives at the meeting.\r\nThe conferences lasted nineteen days, with the inevitable formalities of\r\nsuch occasions, and the weary repetition of conventional metaphors and\r\nlong-winded speeches. At length, every difficulty being settled, the\r\nGovernor of Pennsylvania, in behalf of all the English, rose with a\r\nwampum belt in his hand, and addressed the tawny congregation thus: \"By\r\nthis belt we heal your wounds; we remove your grief; we take the hatchet\r\nout of your heads; we make a hole in the earth, and bury it so deep that\r\nnobody can dig it up again.\" Then, laying the first belt before them, he\r\ntook another, very large, made of white wampum beads, in token of peace:\r\n\"By this belt we renew all our treaties; we brighten the chain of\r\nfriendship; we put fresh earth to the roots of the tree of peace, that\r\nit may bear up against every storm, and live and nourish while the sun\r\nshines and the rivers run.\" And he gave them the belt with the request\r\nthat they would send it to their friends and allies, and invite them to\r\ntake hold also of the chain of friendship. Accordingly all present\r\nagreed on a joint message of peace to the tribes of the Ohio.[657]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 657: _Minutes of Conferences at Easton, October, 1758._]\r\n\r\nFrederic Post, with several white and Indian companions, was chosen to\r\nbear it. A small escort of soldiers that attended him as far as the\r\nAlleghany was cut to pieces on its return by a band of the very warriors\r\nto whom he was carrying his offers of friendship; and other tenants of\r\nthe grim and frowning wilderness met the invaders of their domain with\r\ninhospitable greetings. \"The wolves made a terrible music this night,\"\r\nhe writes at his first bivouac after leaving Loyalhannon. When he\r\nreached the Delaware towns his reception was ominous. The young warriors\r\nsaid: \"Anybody can see with half an eye that the English only mean to\r\ncheat us. Let us knock the messengers in the head.\" Some of them had\r\nattacked an English outpost, and had been repulsed; hence, in the words\r\nof Post, \"They were possessed with a murdering spirit, and with bloody\r\nvengeance were thirsty and drunk. I said: 'As God has stopped the mouths\r\nof the lions that they could not devour Daniel, so he will preserve us\r\nfrom their fury.'\" The chiefs and elders were of a different mind from\r\ntheir fierce and capricious young men. They met during the evening in\r\nthe log-house where Post and his party lodged; and here a French officer\r\npresently arrived with a string of wampum from the commandant, inviting\r\nthem to help him drive back the army of Forbes. The string was\r\nscornfully rejected. \"They kicked it from one to another as if it were a\r\nsnake. Captain Peter took a stick, and with it flung the string from one\r\nend of the room to the other, and said: 'Give it to the French captain;\r\nhe boasted of his fighting, now let us see him fight. We have often\r\nventured our lives for him, and got hardly a loaf of bread in return;\r\nand now he thinks we shall jump to serve him.' Then we saw the French\r\ncaptain mortified to the uttermost. He looked as pale as death. The\r\nIndians discoursed and joked till midnight, and the French captain sent\r\nmessengers at midnight to Fort Duquesne.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a grand council, at which the French officer was present; and\r\nPost delivered the peace message from the council at Easton, along with\r\nanother with which Forbes had charged him. \"The messages pleased all the\r\nhearers except the French captain. He shook his head in bitter grief,\r\nand often changed countenance. Isaac Still [_an Indian_] ran him down\r\nwith great boldness, and pointed at him, saying, 'There he sits!' They\r\nall said: 'The French always deceived us!' pointing at the French\r\ncaptain; who, bowing down his head, turned quite pale, and could look no\r\none in the face. All the Indians began to mock and laugh at him. He\r\ncould hold it no longer, and went out.\"[658]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 658: _Journal of Christian Frederic Post, October, November,\r\n1758._]\r\n\r\nThe overtures of peace were accepted, and the Delawares, Shawanoes, and\r\nMingoes were no longer enemies of the English. The loss was the more\r\ndisheartening to the French, since, some weeks before, they had gained a\r\nsuccess which they hoped would confirm the adhesion of all their\r\nwavering allies. Major Grant, of the Highlanders, had urged Bouquet to\r\nsend him to reconnoitre Fort Duquesne, capture prisoners, and strike a\r\nblow that would animate the assailants and discourage the assailed.\r\nBouquet, forgetting his usual prudence, consented; and Grant set out\r\nfrom the camp at Loyalhannon with about eight hundred men, Highlanders,\r\nRoyal Americans, and provincials. On the fourteenth of September, at two\r\nin the morning, he reached the top of the rising ground thenceforth\r\ncalled Grant's Hill, half a mile or more from the French fort. The\r\nforest and the darkness of the night hid him completely from the enemy.\r\nHe ordered Major Lewis, of the Virginians, to take with him half the\r\ndetachment, descend to the open plain before the fort, and attack the\r\nIndians known to be encamped there; after which he was to make a feigned\r\nretreat to the hill, where the rest of the troops were to lie in ambush\r\nand receive the pursuers. Lewis set out on his errand, while Grant\r\nwaited anxiously for the result. Dawn was near, and all was silent; till\r\nat length Lewis returned, and incensed his commander by declaring that\r\nhis men had lost their way in the dark woods, and fallen into such\r\nconfusion that the attempt was impracticable. The morning twilight now\r\nbegan, but the country was wrapped in thick fog. Grant abandoned his\r\nfirst plan, and sent a few Highlanders into the cleared ground to burn a\r\nwarehouse that had been seen there. He was convinced that the French and\r\ntheir Indians were too few to attack him, though their numbers in fact\r\nwere far greater than his own.[659] Infatuated with this idea, and bent\r\non taking prisoners, he had the incredible rashness to divide his force\r\nin such a way that the several parts could not support each other.\r\nLewis, with two hundred men, was sent to guard the baggage two miles in\r\nthe rear, where a company of Virginians, under Captain Bullitt, was\r\nalready stationed. A hundred Pennsylvanians were posted far off on the\r\nright, towards the Alleghany, while Captain Mackenzie, with a detachment\r\nof Highlanders, was sent to the left, towards the Monongahela. Then, the\r\nfog having cleared a little, Captain Macdonald, with another company of\r\nHighlanders, was ordered into the open plain to reconnoitre the fort and\r\nmake a plan of it, Grant himself remaining on the hill with a hundred\r\nof his own regiment and a company of Maryland men. \"In order to put on a\r\ngood countenance,\" he says, \"and convince our men they had no reason to\r\nbe afraid, I gave directions to our drums to beat the reveille. The\r\ntroops were in an advantageous post, and I must own I thought we had\r\nnothing to fear.\" Macdonald was at this time on the plain, midway\r\nbetween the woods and the fort, and in full sight of it. The roll of the\r\ndrums from the hill was answered by a burst of war-whoops, and the\r\nFrench came swarming out like hornets, many of them in their shirts,\r\nhaving just leaped from their beds. They all rushed upon Macdonald and\r\nhis men, who met them with a volley that checked their advance; on which\r\nthey surrounded him at a distance, and tried to cut off his retreat. The\r\nHighlanders broke through, and gained the woods, with the loss of their\r\ncommander, who was shot dead. A crowd of French followed close, and soon\r\nput them to rout, driving them and Mackenzie's party back to the hill\r\nwhere Grant was posted. Here there was a hot fight in the forest,\r\nlasting about three quarters of an hour. At length the force of numbers,\r\nthe novelty of the situation, and the appalling yells of the Canadians\r\nand Indians, completely overcame the Highlanders, so intrepid in the\r\nordinary situations of war. They broke away in a wild and disorderly\r\nretreat. \"Fear,\" says Grant, \"got the better of every other passion; and\r\nI trust I shall never again see such a panic among troops.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 659: _Grant to Forbes, no date._ \"Les rapports sur le nombre\r\ndes Français varient de 3,000 à 1,200.\" _Bouquet à Forbes, 17 Sept.\r\n1758._ Bigot says that 3,500 daily rations were delivered at Fort\r\nDuquesne throughout the summer. _Bigot au Ministre, 22 Nov. 1758._ In\r\nOctober the number had fallen to 1,180, which included Indians.\r\n_Ligneris à Vaudreuil, 18 Oct. 1758._]\r\n\r\nHis only hope was in the detachment he had sent to the rear under Lewis\r\nto guard the baggage. But Lewis and his men, when they heard the firing\r\nin front, had left their post and pushed forward to help their comrades,\r\ntaking a straight course through the forest; while Grant was retreating\r\nalong the path by which he had advanced the night before. Thus they\r\nmissed each other; and when Grant reached the spot where he expected to\r\nfind Lewis, he saw to his dismay that nobody was there but Captain\r\nBullitt and his company. He cried in despair that he was a ruined man;\r\nnot without reason, for the whole body of French and Indians was upon\r\nhim. Such of his men as held together were forced towards the\r\nAlleghany, and, writes Bouquet, \"would probably have been cut to pieces\r\nbut for Captain Bullitt and his Virginians, who kept up the fight\r\nagainst the whole French force till two thirds of them were killed.\"\r\nThey were offered quarter, but refused it; and the survivors were driven\r\nat last into the Alleghany, where some were drowned, and others swam\r\nover and escaped. Grant was surrounded and captured, and Lewis, who\r\npresently came up, was also made prisoner, along with some of his men,\r\nafter a stiff resistance. Thus ended this mismanaged affair, which cost\r\nthe English two hundred and seventy three killed, wounded, and taken.\r\nThe rest got back safe to Loyalhannon.[660]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 660: On Grant's defeat, _Grant to Forbes, no date_, a long and\r\nminute report, written while a prisoner. _Bouquet à Forbes, 17 Sept.\r\n1758.

Vaudreuil, with characteristic exaggeration,\r\nrepresents all Grant's party as killed or taken, except a few who died\r\nof starvation. The returns show that 540 came back safe, out of 813.]\r\n\r\nThe invalid General was deeply touched by this reverse, yet expressed\r\nhimself with a moderation that does him honor. He wrote to Bouquet from\r\nRaystown: \"Your letter of the seventeenth I read with no less surprise\r\nthan concern, as I could not believe that such an attempt would have\r\nbeen made without my knowledge and concurrence. The breaking in upon our\r\nfair and flattering hopes of success touches me most sensibly. There are\r\ntwo wounded Highland officers just now arrived, who give so lame an\r\naccount of the matter that one can draw nothing from them, only that my\r\nfriend Grant most certainly lost his wits, and by his thirst of fame\r\nbrought on his own perdition, and ran great risk of ours.\"[661]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 661: _Forbes to Bouquet, 23 Sept. 1758._]\r\n\r\nThe French pushed their advantage with spirit. Early in October a large\r\nbody of them hovered in the woods about the camp at Loyalhannon, drove\r\nback a detachment sent against them, approached under cover of the\r\ntrees, and, though beaten off, withdrew deliberately, after burying\r\ntheir dead and killing great numbers of horses and cattle.[662] But,\r\nwith all their courageous energy, their position was desperate. The\r\nmilitia of Louisiana and the Illinois left the fort in November and went\r\nhome; the Indians of Detroit and the Wabash would stay no longer; and,\r\nworse yet, the supplies destined for Fort Duquesne had been destroyed by\r\nBradstreet at Fort Frontenac. Hence Ligneris was compelled by\r\nprospective starvation to dismiss the greater part of his force, and\r\nawait the approach of his enemy with those that remained.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 662: _Burd to Bouquet, 12 Oct. 1758.

Vaudreuil au Ministre, 20 Nov.\r\n1758._]\r\n\r\nHis enemy was in a plight hardly better than his own. Autumnal rains,\r\nuncommonly heavy and persistent, had ruined the newly-cut road. On the\r\nmountains the torrents tore it up, and in the valleys the wheels of the\r\nwagons and cannon churned it into soft mud. The horses, overworked and\r\nunderfed, were fast breaking down. The forest had little food for them,\r\nand they were forced to drag their own oats and corn, as well as\r\nsupplies for the army, through two hundred miles of wilderness. In the\r\nwretched condition of the road this was no longer possible. The\r\nmagazines of provisions formed at Raystown and Loyalhannon to support\r\nthe army on its forward march were emptied faster than they could be\r\nfilled. Early in October the elements relented; the clouds broke, the\r\nsky was bright again, and the sun shone out in splendor on mountains\r\nradiant in the livery of autumn. A gleam of hope revisited the heart of\r\nForbes. It was but a flattering illusion. The sullen clouds returned,\r\nand a chill, impenetrable veil of mist and rain hid the mountains and\r\nthe trees. Dejected Nature wept and would not be comforted. Above,\r\nbelow, around, all was trickling, oozing, pattering, gushing. In the\r\nmiserable encampments the starved horses stood steaming in the rain, and\r\nthe men crouched, disgusted, under their dripping tents, while the\r\ndrenched picket-guard in the neighboring forest paced dolefully through\r\nblack mire and spongy mosses. The rain turned to snow; the descending\r\nflakes clung to the many-colored foliage, or melted from sight in the\r\ntrench of half-liquid clay that was called a road. The wheels of the\r\nwagons sank in it to the hub, and to advance or retreat was alike\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nForbes from his sick bed at Raystown wrote to Bouquet: \"Your description\r\nof the road pierces me to the very soul.\" And a few days later to Pitt:\r\n\"I am in the greatest distress, occasioned by rains unusual at this\r\nseason, which have rendered the clay roads absolutely impracticable. If\r\nthe weather does not favor, I shall be absolutely locked up in the\r\nmountains. I cannot form any judgment how I am to extricate myself as\r\neverything depends on the weather, which snows and rains frightfully.\"\r\nThere was no improvement. In the next week he writes to Bouquet: \"These\r\nfour days of constant rain have completely ruined the road. The wagons\r\nwould cut it up more in an hour than we could repair in a week. I have\r\nwritten to General Abercromby, but have not had one scrape of a pen from\r\nhim since the beginning of September; so it looks as if we were either\r\nforgot or left to our fate.\"[663] Wasted and tortured by disease, the\r\nperplexed commander was forced to burden himself with a multitude of\r\ndetails which would else have been neglected, and to do the work of\r\ncommissary and quartermaster as well as general. \"My time,\" he writes,\r\n\"is disagreeably spent between business and medicine.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 663: _Forbes to Bouquet, 15 Oct. 1758. Ibid., 25 Oct. 1758.\r\nForbes to Pitt, 20 Oct. 1758._]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of November he was carried to Loyalhannon, where the\r\nwhole army was then gathered. There was a council of officers, and they\r\nresolved to attempt nothing more that season; but, a few days later,\r\nthree prisoners were brought in who reported the defenceless condition\r\nof the French, on which Forbes gave orders to advance again. The wagons\r\nand all the artillery, except a few light pieces, were left behind; and\r\non the eighteenth of November twenty-five hundred picked men marched for\r\nFort Duquesne, without tents or baggage, and burdened only with\r\nknapsacks and blankets. Washington and Colonel Armstrong, of the\r\nPennsylvanians, had opened a way for them by cutting a road to within a\r\nday's march of the French fort. On the evening of the twenty-fourth, the\r\ndetachment encamped among the hills of Turkey Creek; and the men on\r\nguard heard at midnight a dull and heavy sound booming over the western\r\nwoods. Was it a magazine exploded by accident, or were the French\r\nblowing up their works? In the morning the march was resumed, a strong\r\nadvance-guard leading the way. Forbes came next, carried in his litter;\r\nand the troops followed in three parallel columns, the Highlanders in\r\nthe centre under Montgomery, their colonel, and the Royal Americans and\r\nprovincials on the right and left, under Bouquet and Washington.[664]\r\nThus, guided by the tap of the drum at the head of each column, they\r\nmoved slowly through the forest, over damp, fallen leaves, crisp with\r\nfrost, beneath an endless entanglement of bare gray twigs that sighed\r\nand moaned in the bleak November wind. It was dusk when they emerged\r\nupon the open plain and saw Fort Duquesne before them, with its\r\nbackground of wintry hills beyond the Monongahela and the Alleghany.\r\nDuring the last three miles they had passed the scattered bodies of\r\nthose slain two months before at the defeat of Grant; and it is said\r\nthat, as they neared the fort, the Highlanders were goaded to fury at\r\nseeing the heads of their slaughtered comrades stuck on poles, round\r\nwhich the kilts were hung derisively, in imitation of petticoats. Their\r\nrage was vain; the enemy was gone. Only a few Indians lingered about the\r\nplace, who reported that the garrison, to the number of four or five\r\nhundred, had retreated, some down the Ohio, some overland towards\r\nPresquisle, and the rest, with their commander, up the Alleghany to\r\nVenango, called by the French, Fort Machault. They had burned the\r\nbarracks and storehouses, and blown up the fortifications.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 664: _Letter from a British Officer in the Expedition, 25 Feb.\r\n1759, Gentleman's Magazine_, XXIX. 171.]\r\n\r\nThe first care of the victors was to provide defence and shelter for\r\nthose of their number on whom the dangerous task was to fall of keeping\r\nwhat they had won. A stockade was planted around a cluster of traders'\r\ncabins and soldiers' huts, which Forbes named Pittsburg, in honor of the\r\ngreat minister. It was not till the next autumn that General Stanwix\r\nbuilt, hard by, the regular fortified work called Fort Pitt.[665]\r\nCaptain West, brother of Benjamin West, the painter, led a detachment of\r\nPennsylvanians, with Indian guides, through the forests of the\r\nMonongahela, to search for the bones of those who had fallen under\r\nBraddock. In the heart of the savage wood they found them in abundance,\r\ngnawed by wolves and foxes, and covered with the dead leaves of four\r\nsuccessive autumns. Major Halket, of Forbes' staff, had joined the\r\nparty; and, with the help of an Indian who was in the fight, he\r\npresently found two skeletons lying under a tree. In one of them he\r\nrecognized, by a peculiarity of the teeth, the remains of his father,\r\nSir Peter Halket, and in the other he believed that he saw the bones of\r\na brother who had fallen at his father's side. The young officer fainted\r\nat the sight. The two skeletons were buried together, covered with a\r\nHighland plaid, and the Pennsylvanian woodsmen fired a volley over the\r\ngrave. The rest of the bones were undistinguishable; and, being\r\ncarefully gathered up, they were all interred in a deep trench dug in\r\nthe freezing ground.[666]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 665: _Stanwix to Pitt, 20 Nov. 1759_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 666: Galt, _Life of Benjamin West_, I. 64 (ed. 1820).]\r\n\r\nThe work of the new fort was pushed on apace, and the task of holding it\r\nfor the winter was assigned to Lieutenant-Colonel Mercer, of the\r\nVirginians, with two hundred provincials. The number was far too small.\r\nIt was certain that, unless vigorously prevented by a counter attack,\r\nthe French would gather in early spring from all their nearer western\r\nposts, Niagara, Detroit, Presquisle, Le Boeuf, and Venango, to retake\r\nthe place; but there was no food for a larger garrison, and the risk\r\nmust be run.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the troops, with steps quickened by hunger, began their\r\nhomeward march early in December. \"We would soon make M. de Ligneris\r\nshift his quarters at Venango,\" writes Bouquet just after the fort was\r\ntaken, \"if we only had provisions; but we are scarcely able to maintain\r\nourselves a few days here. After God, the success of this expedition is\r\nentirely due to the General, who, by bringing about the treaty with the\r\nIndians at Easton, struck the French a stunning blow, wisely delayed our\r\nadvance to wait the effects of that treaty, secured all our posts and\r\nleft nothing to chance, and resisted the urgent solicitation to take\r\nBraddock's road, which would have been our destruction. In all his\r\nmeasures he has shown the greatest prudence, firmness, and\r\nability.\"[667] No sooner was his work done, than Forbes fell into a\r\nstate of entire prostration, so that for a time he could neither write a\r\nletter nor dictate one. He managed, however, two days after reaching\r\nFort Duquesne, to send Amherst a brief notice of his success, adding: \"I\r\nshall leave this place as soon as I am able to stand; but God knows when\r\nI shall reach Philadelphia, if I ever do.\"[668] On the way back, a hut\r\nwith a chimney was built for him at each stopping-place, and on the\r\ntwenty-eighth of December Major Halket writes from \"Tomahawk Camp:\" \"How\r\ngreat was our disappointment, on coming to this ground last night, to\r\nfind that the chimney was unlaid, no fire made, nor any wood cut that\r\nwould burn. This distressed the General to the greatest degree, by\r\nobliging him after his long journey to sit above two hours without any\r\nfire, exposed to a snowstorm, which had very near destroyed him\r\nentirely; but with great difficulty, by the assistance of some cordials,\r\nhe was brought to.\"[669] At length, carried all the way in his litter,\r\nhe reached Philadelphia, where, after lingering through the winter, he\r\ndied in March, and was buried with military honors in the chancel of\r\nChrist Church.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 667: _Bouquet to Chief Justice Allen, 15 Nov. 1758._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 668: _Forbes to Amherst, 26 Nov. 1758._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 669: _Halket to Bouquet, 28 Dec. 1758._]\r\n\r\nIf his achievement was not brilliant, its solid value was above price.\r\nIt opened the Great West to English enterprise, took from France half\r\nher savage allies, and relieved the western borders from the scourge of\r\nIndian war. From southern New York to North Carolina, the frontier\r\npopulations had cause to bless the memory of the steadfast and\r\nall-enduring soldier.\r\n\r\nSo ended the campaign of 1758. The centre of the French had held its own\r\ntriumphantly at Ticonderoga; but their left had been forced back by the\r\ncapture of Louisbourg, and their right by that of Fort Duquesne, while\r\ntheir entire right wing had been well nigh cut off by the destruction of\r\nFort Frontenac. The outlook was dark. Their own Indians were turning\r\nagainst them. \"They have struck us,\" wrote Doreil to the Minister of\r\nWar; \"they have seized three canoes loaded with furs on Lake Ontario,\r\nand murdered the men in them: sad forerunner of what we have to fear!\r\nPeace, Monseigneur, give us peace! Pardon me, but I cannot repeat that\r\nword too often.\"\r\n\r\nNOTE: The _Bouquet and Haldimand Papers_ in the British Museum contain a\r\nmass of curious correspondence of the principal persons engaged in the\r\nexpedition under Forbes; copies of it all are before me. The Public\r\nRecord Office, _America and West Indies_, has also furnished much\r\nmaterial, including the official letters of Forbes. The _Writings of\r\nWashington_, the _Archives_ and _Colonial Records_ of Pennsylvania, and\r\nthe magazines and newspapers of the time may be mentioned among the\r\nsources of information, along with a variety of miscellaneous\r\ncontemporary letters. The Journals of Christian Frederic Post are\r\nprinted in full in the _Olden Time_ and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 23\r\n\r\n1758, 1759\r\n\r\nThe Brink of Ruin\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Never was general in a more critical position than I was: God has\r\ndelivered me; his be the praise! He gives me health, though I am worn\r\nout with labor, fatigue, and miserable dissensions that have determined\r\nme to ask for my recall. Heaven grant that I may get it!\"\r\n\r\nThus wrote Montcalm to his mother after his triumph at Ticonderoga. That\r\ngreat exploit had entailed a train of vexations, for it stirred the envy\r\nof Vaudreuil, more especially as it was due to the troops of the line,\r\nwith no help from Indians, and very little from Canadians. The Governor\r\nassured the Colonial Minister that the victory would have bad results,\r\nthough he gives no hint what these might be; that Montcalm had\r\nmismanaged the whole affair; that he would have been beaten but for the\r\nmanifest interposition of Heaven;[670] and, finally, that he had failed\r\nto follow his (Vaudreuil's) directions, and had therefore enabled the\r\nEnglish to escape. The real directions of the Governor, dictated,\r\nperhaps, by dread lest his rival should reap laurels, were to avoid a\r\ngeneral engagement; and it was only by setting them at nought that\r\nAbercromby had been routed. After the battle a sharp correspondence\r\npassed between the two chiefs. The Governor, who had left Montcalm to\r\nhis own resources before the crisis, sent him Canadians and Indians in\r\nabundance after it was over; while he cautiously refrained from\r\ncommitting himself by positive orders, repeated again and again that if\r\nthese reinforcements were used to harass Abercromby's communications,\r\nthe whole English army would fall back to the Hudson, and leave baggage\r\nand artillery a prey to the French. These preposterous assertions and\r\ntardy succors were thought by Montcalm to be a device for giving color\r\nto the charge that he had not only failed to deserve victory, but had\r\nfailed also to make use of it.[671] He did what was possible, and sent\r\nstrong detachments to act in the English rear; which, though they did\r\nnot, and could not, compel the enemy to fall back, caused no slight\r\nannoyance, till Rogers checked them by the defeat of Marin. Nevertheless\r\nVaudreuil pretended on one hand that Montcalm had done nothing with the\r\nCanadians and Indians sent him, and on the other that these same\r\nCanadians and Indians had triumphed over the enemy by their mere\r\npresence at Ticonderoga. \"It was my activity in sending these succors to\r\nCarillon [_Ticonderoga_] that forced the English to retreat. The Marquis\r\nde Montcalm might have made their retreat difficult; but it was in vain\r\nthat I wrote to him, in vain that the colony troops, Canadians and\r\nIndians, begged him to pursue the enemy.\"[672] The succors he speaks of\r\nwere sent in July and August, while the English did not fall back till\r\nthe first of November. Neither army left its position till the season\r\nwas over, and Abercromby did so only when he learned that the French\r\nwere setting the example. Vaudreuil grew more and more bitter. \"As the\r\nKing has intrusted this colony to me, I cannot help warning you of the\r\nunhappy consequences that would follow if the Marquis de Montcalm should\r\nremain here. I shall keep him by me till I receive your orders. It is\r\nessential that they reach me early.\" \"I pass over in silence all the\r\ninfamous conduct and indecent talk he has held or countenanced; but I\r\nshould be wanting in my duty to the King if I did not beg you to ask for\r\nhis recall.\"[673]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 670: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 8 Août, 1758_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 671: Much of the voluminous correspondence on these matters\r\nwill be found in _N.Y. Col. Docs._, X.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 672: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 8 Avril, 1759._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 673: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nHe does not say what is meant by infamous conduct and indecent talk; but\r\nthe allusion is probably to irreverent utterances touching the Governor\r\nin which the officers from France were apt to indulge, not always\r\nwithout the knowledge of their chief. Vaudreuil complained of this to\r\nMontcalm, adding, \"I am greatly above it, and I despise it.\"[674] To\r\nwhich the General replied: \"You are right to despise gossip, supposing\r\nthat there has been any. For my part, though I hear that I have been\r\ntorn to pieces without mercy in your presence, I do not believe\r\nit.\"[675]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 674: _Vaudreuil à Montcalm, 1 Août, 1758._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 675: _Montcalm à Vaudreuil, 6 Août, 1758._]\r\n\r\nIn these infelicities Bigot figures as peacemaker, though with no\r\nperceptible success. Vaudreuil's cup of bitterness was full when letters\r\ncame from Versailles ordering him to defer to Montcalm on all questions\r\nof war, or of civil administration bearing up war.[676] He had begged\r\nhard for his rival's recall, and in reply his rival was set over his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 676: _Ordres du Roy et Dépêches des Ministres, 1758, 1759_.]\r\n\r\nThe two yokefellows were excellently fitted to exasperate each other:\r\nMontcalm, with his southern vivacity of emotion and an impetuous,\r\nimpatient volubility that sometimes forgot prudence; and Vaudreuil,\r\nalways affable towards adherents, but full of suspicious egotism and\r\nrestless jealousy that bristled within him at the very thought of his\r\ncolleague. Some of the by-play of the quarrel may be seen in Montcalm's\r\nfamiliar correspondence with Bourlamaque. One day the Governor, in his\r\nown house, brought up the old complaint that Montcalm, after taking Fort\r\nWilliam Henry, did not take Fort Edward also. The General, for the\r\ntwentieth time, gave good reasons for not making the attempt. \"I ended,\"\r\nhe tells Bourlamaque, \"by saying quietly that when I went to war I did\r\nthe best I could; and that when one is not pleased with one's\r\nlieutenants, one had better take the field in person. He was very much\r\nmoved, and muttered between his teeth that perhaps he would; at which I\r\nsaid that I should be delighted to serve under him. Madame de Vaudreuil\r\nwanted to put in her word. I said: 'Madame, saving due respect, permit\r\nme to have the honor to say that ladies ought not to talk war.' She kept\r\non. I said: 'Madame, saving due respect, permit me to have the honor to\r\nsay that if Madame de Montcalm were here, and heard me talking war with\r\nMonsieur le Marquis de Vaudreuil, she would remain silent.' This scene\r\nwas in presence of eight officers, three of them belonging to the colony\r\ntroops; and a pretty story they will make of it.\"\r\n\r\nThese letters to Bourlamaque, in their detestable handwriting, small,\r\ncramped, confused, without stops, and sometimes almost indecipherable,\r\nbetray the writer's state of mind. \"I should like as well as anybody to\r\nbe Marshal of France; but to buy the honor with the life I am leading\r\nhere would be too much.\" He recounts the last news from Fort Duquesne,\r\njust before its fall. \"Mutiny among the Canadians, who want to come\r\nhome; the officers busy with making money, and stealing like mandarins.\r\nTheir commander sets the example, and will come back with three or four\r\nhundred thousand francs; the pettiest ensign, who does not gamble, will\r\nhave ten, twelve, or fifteen thousand. The Indians don't like Ligneris,\r\nwho is drunk every day. Forgive the confusion of this letter; I have not\r\nslept all night with thinking of the robberies and mismanagement and\r\nfolly. _Pauvre Roi, pauvre France, cara patria!_\" \"Oh, when shall we get\r\nout of this country! I think I would give half that I have to go home.\r\nPardon this digression to a melancholy man. It is not that I have not\r\nstill some remnants of gayety; but what would seem such in anybody else\r\nis melancholy for a Languedocian. Burn my letter, and never doubt my\r\nattachment.\" \"I shall always say, Happy he who is free from the proud\r\nyoke to which I am bound. When shall I see my château of Candiac, my\r\nplantations, my chestnut grove, my oil-mill, my mulberry-trees? _O bon\r\nDieu! Bon soir; brûlez ma lettre.\"_[677]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 677: The above extracts are from letters of 5 and 27 Nov. and\r\n9 Dec. 1758, and 18 and 23 March, 1759.]\r\n\r\nNever was dispute more untimely than that between these ill-matched\r\ncolleagues. The position of the colony was desperate. Thus far the\r\nCanadians had never lost heart, but had obeyed with admirable alacrity\r\nthe Governor's call to arms, borne with patience the burdens and\r\nprivations of the war, and submitted without revolt to the exactions and\r\noppressions of Cadet and his crew; loyal to their native soil, loyal to\r\ntheir Church, loyal to the wretched government that crushed and\r\nbelittled them. When the able-bodied were ordered to the war, where four\r\nfifths of them were employed in the hard and tedious work of\r\ntransportation, the women, boys and old men tilled the fields and raised\r\na scanty harvest, which always might be, and sometimes was, taken from\r\nthem in the name of the King. Yet the least destitute among them were\r\nforced every winter to lodge soldiers in their houses, for each of whom\r\nthey were paid fifteen france a month, in return for substance devoured\r\nand wives and daughters debauched.[678]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 678: _Mémoire sur le moyen d'entretenir 10,000 Hommes de\r\nTroupes dans les Colonies, 1759._]\r\n\r\nNo pains had been spared to keep up the courage of the people and feed\r\nthem with flattering illusions. When the partisan officer Boishébert was\r\ntried for peculation, his counsel met the charge by extolling the manner\r\nin which he had fulfilled the arduous duty of encouraging the Acadians,\r\n\"putting on an air of triumph even in defeat; using threats, caresses,\r\nstratagems; painting our victories in vivid colors; hiding the strength\r\nand successes of the enemy; promising succors that did not and could not\r\ncome; inventing plausible reasons why they did not come, and making new\r\npromises to set off the failure of the old; persuading a starved people\r\nto forget their misery; taking from some to give to others; and doing\r\nall this continually in the face of a superior enemy, that this country\r\nmight be snatched from England and saved to France.\"[679] What\r\nBoishébert was doing in Acadia, Vaudreuil was doing on a larger scale in\r\nCanada. By indefatigable lying, by exaggerating every success and\r\ncovering over every reverse, he deceived the people and in some measure\r\nhimself. He had in abundance the Canadian gift of gasconade, and boasted\r\nto the Colonial Minister that one of his countrymen was a match for from\r\nthree to ten Englishmen. It is possible that he almost believed it; for\r\nthe midnight surprise of defenceless families and the spreading of\r\npanics among scattered border settlements were inseparable from his idea\r\nof war. Hence the high value he set on Indians, who in such work outdid\r\nthe Canadians themselves. Sustained by the intoxication of flattering\r\nfalsehoods, and not doubting that the blunders and weakness of the first\r\nyears of the war gave the measure of English efficiency, the colonists\r\nhad never suspected that they could be subdued.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 679: _Procès de Bigot, Cadet, et autres, Mémoire pour le Sieur\r\nde Boishébert._]\r\n\r\nBut now there was a change. The reverses of the last campaign, hunger,\r\nweariness, and possibly some incipient sense of atrocious misgovernment,\r\nbegan to produce their effect; and some, especially in the towns, were\r\nheard to murmur that further resistance was useless. The Canadians,\r\nthough brave and patient, needed, like Frenchmen, the stimulus of\r\nsuccess. \"The people are alarmed,\" said the modest Governor, \"and would\r\nlose courage if my firmness did not rekindle their zeal to serve the\r\nKing.\"[680]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 680: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 10 Avril, 1759._]\r\n\r\n\"Rapacity, folly, intrigue, falsehood, will soon ruin this colony which\r\nhas cost the King so dear,\" wrote Doreil to the Minister of War. \"We\r\nmust not flatter ourselves with vain hope; Canada is lost if we do not\r\nhave peace this winter.\" \"It has been saved by miracle in these past\r\nthree years; nothing but peace can save it now, in spite of all the\r\nefforts and the talents of M. de Montcalm.\"[681] Vaudreuil himself\r\nbecame thoroughly alarmed, and told the Court in the autumn of 1758 that\r\nfood, arms, munitions, and everything else were fast failing, and that\r\nwithout immediate peace or heavy reinforcements all was lost.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 681: _Doreil au Ministre, 31 Juillet, 1758. Ibid. 12 Août,\r\n1758. Ibid. 31 Août, 1758. Ibid. 1 Sept. 1758._]\r\n\r\nThe condition of Canada was indeed deplorable. The St. Lawrence was\r\nwatched by British ships; the harvest was meagre; a barrel of flour cost\r\ntwo hundred francs; most of the cattle and many of the horses had been\r\nkilled for food. The people lived chiefly on a pittance of salt cod or\r\non rations furnished by the King; all prices were inordinate; the\r\nofficers from France were starving on their pay; while a legion of\r\nindigenous and imported scoundrels fattened on the general distress.\r\n\"What a country!\" exclaims Montcalm. \"Here all the knaves grow rich, and\r\nthe honest men are ruined.\" Yet he was resolved to stand by it to the\r\nlast, and wrote to the Minister of War that he would bury himself under\r\nits ruins. \"I asked for my recall after the glorious affair of the\r\neighth of July; but since the state of the colony is so bad, I must do\r\nwhat I can to help it and retard its fall.\" The only hope was in a\r\nstrong appeal to the Court; and he thought himself fortunate in\r\npersuading Vaudreuil to consent that Bougainville should be commissioned\r\nto make it, seconded by Doreil. They were to sail in different ships, in\r\norder that at least one of them might arrive safe.\r\n\r\nVaudreuil gave Bougainville a letter introducing him to the Colonial\r\nMinister in high terms of praise: \"He is in all respects better fitted\r\nthan anybody else to inform you of the state of the colony. I have given\r\nhim my instructions, and you can trust entirely in what he tells\r\nyou.\"[682] Concerning Doreil he wrote to the Minister of War: \"I have\r\nfull confidence in him, and he may be entirely trusted. Everybody here\r\nlikes him.\"[683] While thus extolling the friends of his rival, the\r\nGovernor took care to provide against the effects of his politic\r\ncommendations, and wrote thus to his patron, the Colonial Minister: \"In\r\norder to condescend to the wishes of M. de Montcalm, and leave no means\r\nuntried to keep in harmony with him, I have given letters to MM. Doreil\r\nand Bougainville; but I have the honor to inform you, Monseigneur, that\r\nthey do not understand the colony, and to warn you that they are\r\ncreatures of M. de Montcalm.\"[684]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 682: _Vaudreuil au Ministre de la Marine, 4 Nov. 1758._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 683: _Vaudreuil au Ministre de la Guerre, 11 Oct. 1758._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 684: _Vaudreuil au Ministre de la Marine, 3 Nov. 1758._]\r\n\r\nThe two envoys had sailed for France. Winter was close at hand, and the\r\nharbor of Quebec was nearly empty. One ship still lingered, the last of\r\nthe season, and by her Montcalm sent a letter to his mother: \"You will\r\nbe glad to have me write to you up to the last moment to tell you for\r\nthe hundredth time that, occupied as I am with the fate of New France,\r\nthe preservation of the troops, the interest of the state, and my own\r\nglory, I think continually of you all. We did our best in 1756, 1757,\r\nand 1758; and so, God helping, we will do in 1759, unless you make peace\r\nin Europe.\" Then, shut from the outer world for half a year by barriers\r\nof ice, he waited what returning spring might bright forth.\r\n\r\nBoth Bougainville and Doreil escaped the British cruisers and safely\r\nreached Versailles, where, in the slippery precincts of the Court, as\r\nnew to him as they were treacherous, the young aide-de-camp justified\r\nall the confidence of his chief. He had interviews with the ministers,\r\nthe King, and, more important than all, with Madame de Pompadour, whom\r\nhe succeeded in propitiating, though not, it seems, without difficulty\r\nand delay. France, unfortunate by land and sea, with finances ruined and\r\nnavy crippled, had gained one brilliant victory, and she owed it to\r\nMontcalm. She could pay for it in honors, if in nothing else. Montcalm\r\nwas made lieutenant-general, Lévis major-general, Bourlamaque brigadier,\r\nand Bougainville colonel and chevalier of St. Louis; while Vaudreuil was\r\nsolaced with the grand cross of that order.[685] But when the two envoys\r\nasked substantial aid for the imperilled colony, the response was\r\nchilling. The Colonial Minister, Berryer, prepossessed against\r\nBougainville by the secret warning of Vaudreuil, received him coldly,\r\nand replied to his appeal for help: \"Eh, Monsieur, when the house is on\r\nfire one cannot occupy one's self with the stable.\" \"At least, Monsieur,\r\nnobody will say that you talk like a horse,\" was the irreverent answer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 685: _Ordres du Roy et Dépêches des Ministres, Janvier,\r\nFévrier, 1759._]\r\n\r\nBougainville laid four memorials before the Court, in which he showed\r\nthe desperate state of the colony and its dire need of help. Thus far,\r\nhe said, Canada has been saved by the dissensions of the English\r\ncolonies; but now, for the first time, they are united against her, and\r\nprepared to put forth their strength. And he begged for troops, arms,\r\nmunitions, food, and a squadron to defend the mouth of the St.\r\nLawrence.[686] The reply, couched in a letter to Montcalm, was to the\r\neffect that it was necessary to concentrate all the strength of the\r\nkingdom for a decisive operation in Europe; that, therefore, the aid\r\nrequired could not be sent; and that the King trusted everything to his\r\nzeal and generalship, joined with the valor of the victors of\r\nTiconderoga.[687] All that could be obtained was between three and four\r\nhundred recruits for the regulars, sixty engineers, sappers, and\r\nartillerymen, and gunpowder, arms, and provisions sufficient, along with\r\nthe supplies brought over by the contractor, Cadet, to carry the colony\r\nthrough the next campaign.[688]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 686: _Mémoire remis au Ministre par M. de Bougainville,\r\nDécembre, 1758_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 687: _Le Ministre à Montcalm, 3 Fév. 1759_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 688: _Ordres du Roy et Dépêches des Ministres, Février,\r\n1759_.]\r\n\r\nMontcalm had intrusted Bougainville with another mission, widely\r\ndifferent. This was no less than the negotiating of suitable marriages\r\nfor the eldest son and daughter of his commander, with whom, in the\r\nconfidence of friendship, he had had many conversations on the matter.\r\n\"He and I,\" Montcalm wrote to his mother, Madame de Saint-Véran, \"have\r\ntwo ideas touching these marriages,--the first, romantic and chimerical;\r\nthe second, good, practicable.\"[689] Bougainville, invoking the aid of a\r\nlady of rank, a friend of the family, acquitted himself well of his\r\ndelicate task. Before he embarked for Canada, in early spring, a treaty\r\nwas on foot for the marriage of the young Comte de Montcalm to an\r\nheiress of sixteen; while Mademoiselle de Montcalm had already become\r\nMadame d'Espineuse. \"Her father will be delighted,\" says the successful\r\nnegotiator.[690]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 689: _Montcalm à Madame de Saint-Véran, 24 Sept. 1758_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 690: _Lettres de Bougainville à Madame de Saint-Véran, 1758,\r\n1759_.]\r\n\r\nAgain he crossed the Atlantic and sailed up the St. Lawrence as the\r\nportentous spring of 1759 was lowering over the dissolving snows of\r\nCanada. With him came a squadron bearing the supplies and the petty\r\nreinforcement which the Court had vouchsafed. \"A little is precious to\r\nthose who have nothing,\" said Montcalm on receiving them. Despatches\r\nfrom the ministers gave warning of a great armament fitted out in\r\nEnglish ports for the attack of Quebec, while a letter to the General\r\nfrom the Maréchal de Belleisle, minister of war, told what was expected\r\nof him, and why he and the colony were abandoned to their fate. \"If we\r\nsent a large reinforcement of troops,\" said Belleisle, \"there would be\r\ngreat fear that the English would intercept them on the way; and as the\r\nKing could never send you forces equal to those which the English are\r\nprepared to oppose to you, the attempt would have no other effect than\r\nto excite the Cabinet of London to increased efforts for preserving its\r\nsuperiority on the American continent.\"\r\n\r\n\"As we must expect the English to turn all their force against Canada,\r\nand attack you on several sides at once, it is necessary that you limit\r\nyour plans of defence to the most essential points and those most\r\nclosely connected, so that, being concentrated within a smaller space,\r\neach part may be within reach of support and succor from the rest. How\r\nsmall soever may be the space you are able to hold, it is indispensable\r\nto keep a footing in North America; for if we once lose the country\r\nentirely, its recovery will be almost impossible. The King counts on\r\nyour zeal, courage, and persistency to accomplish this object, and\r\nrelies on you to spare no pains and no exertions. Impart this\r\nresolution to your chief officers, and join with them to inspire your\r\nsoldiers with it. I have answered for you to the King; I am confident\r\nthat you will not disappoint me, and that for the glory of the nation,\r\nthe good of the state, and your own preservation, you will go to the\r\nutmost extremity rather than submit to conditions as shameful as those\r\nimposed at Louisbourg, the memory of which you will wipe out.\"[691] \"We\r\nwill save this unhappy colony, or perish,\" was the answer of Montcalm.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 691: _Belleisle à Montcalm, 19 Fév_. 1759.]\r\n\r\nIt was believed that Canada would be attacked with at least fifty\r\nthousand men. Vaudreuil had caused a census to be made of the\r\ngovernments of Montreal, Three Rivers, and Quebec. It showed a little\r\nmore than thirteen thousand effective men.[692] To these were to be\r\nadded thirty-five hundred troops of the line, including the late\r\nreinforcement, fifteen hundred colony troops, a body of irregulars in\r\nAcadia, and the militia and _coureurs-de-bois_ of Detroit and the other\r\nupper posts, along with from one to two thousand Indians who could still\r\nbe counted on. Great as was the disparity of numbers, there was good\r\nhope that the centre of the colony could be defended; for the only\r\navenues by which an enemy could approach were barred by the rock of\r\nQuebec, the rapids of the St. Lawrence, and the strong position of\r\nIsle-aux-Noix, at the outlet of Lake Champlain. Montcalm had long\r\ninclined to the plan of concentration enjoined on him by the Minister of\r\nWar. Vaudreuil was of another mind; he insisted on still occupying\r\nAcadia and the forts of the upper country: matters on which he and the\r\nGeneral exchanged a correspondence that widened the breach between them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 692: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 8 Avril_, 1759. The _Mémoires sur\r\nle Canada,_ 1749-1760, says 15,229 effective men.]\r\n\r\nShould every effort of resistance fail, and the invaders force their way\r\ninto the heart of Canada, Montcalm proposed the desperate resort of\r\nabandoning the valley of the St. Lawrence, descending the Mississippi\r\nwith his troops and as many as possible of the inhabitants, and making a\r\nlast stand for France among the swamps of Louisiana.[693]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 693: Mémoire sur le Canada remis au Ministre, 27 Déc. 1758._]\r\n\r\nIn April, before Bougainville's return, he wrote to his wife: \"Can we\r\nhope for another miracle to save us? I trust in God; he fought for us on\r\nthe eighth of July. Come what may, his will be done! I wait the news\r\nfrom France with impatience and dread. We have had none for eight\r\nmonths; and who knows if much can reach us at all this year? How dearly\r\nI have to pay for the dismal privilege of figuring two or three times in\r\nthe gazettes!\" A month later, after Bougainvile had come: \"Our daughter\r\nis well married. I think I would renounce every honor to join you again;\r\nbut the King must be obeyed. The moment when I see you once more will be\r\nthe brightest of my life. Adieu, my heart! I believe that I love you\r\nmore than ever.\"\r\n\r\nBougainville had brought sad news. He had heard before sailing from\r\nFrance that one of Montcalm's daughters was dead, but could not learn\r\nwhich of them. \"I think,\" says the father, \"that it must be poor Mirète,\r\nwho was like me, and whom I loved very much.\" He was never to know if\r\nthis conjecture was true.\r\n\r\nTo Vaudreuil came a repetition of the detested order that he should\r\ndefer to Montcalm on all questions of war; and moreover that he should\r\nnot take command in person except when the whole body of the militia was\r\ncalled out; nor, even then, without consulting his rival.[694] His ire\r\nand vexation produced an access of jealous self-assertion, and drove him\r\ninto something like revolt against the ministerial command. \"If the\r\nEnglish attack Quebec, I shall always hold myself free to go thither\r\nmyself with most of the troops and all the militia and Indians I can\r\nassemble. On arriving I shall give battle to the enemy; and I shall do\r\nso again and again, till I have forced him to retire, or till he has\r\nentirely crushed me by excessive superiority of numbers. My obstinacy in\r\nopposing his landing will be the more _à propos_, as I have not the\r\nmeans of sustaining a siege. If I succeed as I wish, I shall next march\r\nto Carillon to arrest him there. You see, Monseigneur, that the\r\nslightest change in my arrangements would have the most unfortunate\r\nconsequences.\"[695]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 694: _Ordres du Roy et Dépêches des Ministres, Lettre à\r\nVaudreuil, 3 Fév. 1759._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 695: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 8 Avril, 1759._]\r\n\r\nWhether he made good this valorous declaration will presently be seen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE. The Archives de la Guerre and the Archives de la Marine contain a\r\nmass of letters and documents on the subjects treated in the above\r\nchapter; these I have carefully read and collated. The other principal\r\nauthorities are the correspondence of Montcalm with Bourlamaque and with\r\nhis own family; the letters of Vaudreuil preserved in the Archives\r\nNationales; and the letters of Bougainville and Doreil to Montcalm and\r\nMadame de Saint-Véran while on their mission to France. For copies of\r\nthese last I am indebted to the present Marquis de Montcalm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 24\r\n\r\n1758, 1759\r\n\r\nWolfe\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain John Knox, of the forty-third regiment, had spent the winter in\r\ngarrison at Fort Cumberland, on the hill of Beauséjour. For nearly two\r\nyears he and his comrades had been exiles amid the wilds of Nova Scotia,\r\nand the monotonous inaction was becoming insupportable. The great marsh\r\nof Tantemar on the one side, and that of Missaguash on the other, two\r\nvast flat tracts of glaring snow, bounded by dark hills of spruce and\r\nfir, were hateful to their sight. Shooting, fishing, or skating were a\r\ndangerous relief; for the neighborhood was infested by \"vermin,\" as they\r\ncalled the Acadians and their Micmac allies. In January four soldiers\r\nand a ranger were waylaid not far from the fort, disabled by bullets,\r\nand then scalped alive. They were found the next morning on the snow,\r\ncontorted in the agonies of death, and frozen like marble statues. St.\r\nPatrick's Day brought more cheerful excitements. The Irish officers of\r\nthe garrison gave their comrades a feast, having laid in during the\r\nautumn a stock of frozen provisions, that the festival of their saint\r\nmight be duly honored. All was hilarity at Fort Cumberland, where it is\r\nrecorded that punch to the value of twelve pounds sterling, with a\r\ncorresponding supply of wine and beer, was consumed on this joyous\r\noccasion.[696]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 696: Knox, _Historical Journal_, I. 228.]\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of April a schooner came up the bay, bringing letters\r\nthat filled men and officers with delight. The regiment was ordered to\r\nhold itself ready to embark for Louisbourg and join an expedition to the\r\nSt. Lawrence, under command of Major-General Wolfe. All that afternoon\r\nthe soldiers were shouting and cheering in their barracks; and when they\r\nmustered for the evening roll-call, there was another burst of huzzas.\r\nThey waited in expectancy nearly three weeks, and then the transports\r\nwhich were to carry them arrived, bringing the provincials who had been\r\nhastily raised in New England to take their place. These Knox describes\r\nas a mean-looking set of fellows, of all ages and sizes, and without any\r\nkind of discipline; adding that their officers are sober, modest men,\r\nwho, though of confined ideas, talk very clearly and sensibly, and make\r\na decent appearance in blue, faced with scarlet, though the privates\r\nhave no uniform at all.\r\n\r\nAt last the forty-third set sail, the cannon of the fort saluting them,\r\nand the soldiers cheering lustily, overjoyed to escape from their long\r\nimprisonment. A gale soon began; the transports became separated; Knox's\r\nvessel sheltered herself for a time in Passamaquoddy Bay; then passed\r\nthe Grand Menan, and steered southward and eastward along the coast of\r\nNova Scotia. A calm followed the gale; and they moved so slowly that\r\nKnox beguiled the time by fishing over the stern, and caught a halibut\r\nso large that he was forced to call for help to pull it in. Then they\r\nsteered northeastward, now lost in fogs, and now tossed mercilessly on\r\nthose boisterous waves; till, on the twenty-fourth of May, they saw a\r\nrocky and surf-lashed shore, with a forest of masts rising to all\r\nappearance out of it. It was the British fleet in the land-locked harbor\r\nof Louisbourg.\r\n\r\nOn the left, as they sailed through the narrow passage, lay the town,\r\nscarred with shot and shell, the red cross floating over its battered\r\nramparts; and around in a wide semicircle rose the bristling back of\r\nrugged hills, set thick with dismal evergreens. They passed the great\r\nships of the fleet, and anchored among the other transports towards the\r\nhead of the harbor. It was not yet free from ice; and the floating\r\nmasses lay so thick in some parts that the reckless sailors, returning\r\nfrom leave on shore, jumped from one to another to regain their ships.\r\nThere was a review of troops, and Knox went to see it; but it was over\r\nbefore he reached the place, where he was presently told of a\r\ncharacteristic reply just made by Wolfe to some officers who had\r\napologized for not having taught their men the new exercise. \"Poh,\r\npoh!--new exercise--new fiddlestick. If they are otherwise well\r\ndisciplined, and will fight, that's all I shall require of them.\"\r\n\r\nKnox does not record his impressions of his new commander, which must\r\nhave been disappointing. He called him afterwards a British Achilles;\r\nbut in person at least Wolfe bore no likeness to the son of Peleus, for\r\nnever was the soul of a hero cased in a frame so incongruous. His face,\r\nwhen seen in profile, was singular as that of the Great Condé. The\r\nforehead and chin receded; the nose, slightly upturned, formed with the\r\nother features the point of an obtuse triangle; the mouth was by no\r\nmeans shaped to express resolution; and nothing but the clear, bright,\r\nand piercing eye bespoke the spirit within. On his head he wore a black\r\nthree-cornered hat; his red hair was tied in a queue behind; his narrow\r\nshoulders, slender body, and long, thin limbs were cased in a scarlet\r\nfrock, with broad cuffs and ample skirts that reached the knee; while on\r\nhis left arm he wore a band of crape in mourning for his father, of\r\nwhose death he had heard a few days before.\r\n\r\nJames Wolfe was in his thirty-third year. His father was an officer of\r\ndistinction, Major-General Edward Wolfe, and he himself, a delicate and\r\nsensitive child, but an impetuous and somewhat headstrong youth, had\r\nserved the King since the age of fifteen. From childhood he had dreamed\r\nof the army and the wars. At sixteen he was in Flanders, adjutant of his\r\nregiment, discharging the duties of the post in a way that gained him\r\nearly promotion and, along with a painstaking assiduity, showing a\r\nprecocious faculty for commanding men. He passed with credit through\r\nseveral campaigns, took part in the victory of Dettingen, and then went\r\nto Scotland to fight at Culloden. Next we find him at Stirling, Perth,\r\nand Glasgow, always ardent and always diligent, constant in military\r\nduty, and giving his spare hours to mathematics and Latin. He presently\r\nfell in love; and being disappointed, plunged into a variety of\r\ndissipations, contrary to his usual habits, which were far above the\r\nstandard of that profligate time.\r\n\r\nAt twenty-three he was a lieutenant-colonel, commanding his regiment in\r\nthe then dirty and barbarous town of Inverness, amid a disaffected and\r\nturbulent population whom it was his duty to keep in order: a difficult\r\ntask, which he accomplished so well as to gain the special commendation\r\nof the King, and even the goodwill of the Highlanders themselves. He\r\nwas five years among these northern hills, battling with ill-health, and\r\nrestless under the intellectual barrenness of his surroundings. He felt\r\nhis position to be in no way salutary, and wrote to his mother: \"The\r\nfear of becoming a mere ruffian and of imbibing the tyrannical\r\nprinciples of an absolute commander, or giving way insensibly to the\r\ntemptations of power till I became proud, insolent, and\r\nintolerable,--these considerations will make me wish to leave the\r\nregiment before next winter; that by frequenting men above myself I may\r\nknow my true condition, and by discoursing with the other sex may learn\r\nsome civility and mildness of carriage.\" He got leave of absence, and\r\nspent six months in Paris, where he was presented at Court and saw much\r\nof the best society. This did not prevent him from working hard to\r\nperfect himself in French, as well as in horsemanship, fencing, dancing,\r\nand other accomplishments, and from earnestly seeking an opportunity to\r\nstudy the various armies of Europe. In this he was thwarted by the\r\nstupidity and prejudice of the commander-in-chief; and he made what\r\namends he could by extensive reading in all that bore on military\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nHis martial instincts were balanced by strong domestic inclinations. He\r\nwas fond of children; and after his disappointment in love used to say\r\nthat they were the only true inducement to marriage. He was a most\r\ndutiful son, and wrote continually to both his parents. Sometimes he\r\nwould philosophize on the good and ill of life; sometimes he held\r\nquestionings with his conscience; and once he wrote to his mother in a\r\nstrain of self-accusation not to be expected from a bold and determined\r\nsoldier. His nature was a compound of tenderness and fire, which last\r\nsometimes showed itself in sharp and unpleasant flashes. His excitable\r\ntemper was capable almost of fierceness, and he could now and then be\r\nneedlessly stern; but towards his father, mother, and friends he was a\r\nmodel of steady affection. He made friends readily, and kept them, and\r\nwas usually a pleasant companion though subject to sallies of imperious\r\nirritability which occasionally broke through his strong sense of good\r\nbreeding. For this his susceptible constitution was largely answerable,\r\nfor he was a living barometer, and his spirits rose and fell with every\r\nchange of weather. In spite of his impatient outbursts, the officers\r\nwhom he had commanded remained attached to him for life; and, in spite\r\nof his rigorous discipline, he was beloved by his soldiers, to whose\r\ncomfort he was always attentive. Frankness, directness, essential good\r\nfeeling, and a high integrity atoned for all his faults.\r\n\r\nIn his own view, as expressed to his mother, he was a person of very\r\nmoderate abilities, aided by more than usual diligence; but this modest\r\njudgment of himself by no means deprived him of self-confidence, nor,\r\nin time of need, of self-assertion. He delighted in every kind of\r\nhardihood; and, in his contempt for effeminacy, once said to his mother:\r\n\"Better be a savage of some use than a gentle, amorous puppy, obnoxious\r\nto all the world.\" He was far from despising fame; but the controlling\r\nprinciples of his life were duty to his country and his profession,\r\nloyalty to the King, and fidelity to his own ideal of the perfect\r\nsoldier. To the parent who was the confidant of his most intimate\r\nthoughts he said: \"All that I wish for myself is that I may at all times\r\nbe ready and firm to meet that fate we cannot shun, and to die\r\ngracefully and properly when the hour comes.\" Never was wish more\r\nsignally fulfilled. Again he tells her: \"My utmost desire and ambition\r\nis to look steadily upon danger;\" and his desire was accomplished. His\r\nintrepidity was complete. No form of death had power to daunt him. Once\r\nand again, when bound on some deadly enterprise of war, he calmly counts\r\nthe chances whether or not he can compel his feeble body to bear him on\r\ntill the work is done. A frame so delicately strung could not have been\r\ninsensible to danger; but forgetfulness of self, and the absorption of\r\nevery faculty in the object before him, shut out the sense of fear. He\r\nseems always to have been at his best in the thick of battle; most\r\ncomplete in his mastery over himself and over others.\r\n\r\nBut it is in the intimacies of domestic life that one sees him most\r\nclosely, and especially in his letters to his mother, from whom he\r\ninherited his frail constitution, without the beauty that distinguished\r\nher. \"The greatest happiness that I wish for here is to see you happy.\"\r\n\"If you stay much at home I will come and shut myself up with you for\r\nthree weeks or a month, and play at piquet from morning till night; and\r\nyou shall laugh at my short red hair as much as you please.\" The playing\r\nat piquet was a sacrifice to filial attachment; for the mother loved\r\ncards, and the son did not. \"Don't trouble yourself about my room or my\r\nbedclothes; too much care and delicacy at this time would enervate me\r\nand complete the destruction of a tottering constitution. Such as it is,\r\nit must serve me now, and I'll make the best of it while it holds.\" At\r\nthe beginning of the war his father tried to dissuade him from offering\r\nhis services on board the fleet; and he replies in a letter to Mrs.\r\nWolfe: \"It is no time to think of what is convenient or agreeable; that\r\nservice is certainly the best in which we are the most useful. For my\r\npart, I am determined never to give myself a moment's concern about the\r\nnature of the duty which His Majesty is pleased to order us upon. It\r\nwill be a sufficient comfort to you two, as far as my person is\r\nconcerned,--at least it will be a reasonable consolation,--to reflect\r\nthat the Power which has hitherto preserved me may, if it be his\r\npleasure, continue to do so; if not, that it is but a few days or a few\r\nyears more or less, and that those who perish in their duty and in the\r\nservice of their country die honorably.\" Then he proceeds to give\r\nparticular directions about his numerous dogs, for the welfare of which\r\nin his absence he provides with anxious solicitude, especially for \"my\r\nfriend Caesar, who has great merit and much good-humor.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the unfortunate expedition against Rochefort, when the board of\r\ngeneral officers appointed to inquire into the affair were passing the\r\nhighest encomiums upon his conduct, his parents were at Bath, and he\r\ntook possession of their house at Blackheath, whence he wrote to his\r\nmother: \"I lie in your chamber, dress in the General's little parlor,\r\nand dine where you did. The most perceptible difference and change of\r\naffairs (exclusive of the bad table I keep) is the number of dogs in the\r\nyard; but by coaxing Ball [_his father's dog_] and rubbing his back with\r\nmy stick, I have reconciled him with the new ones, and put them in some\r\nmeasure under his protection.\"\r\n\r\nWhen about to sail on the expedition against Louisbourg, he was anxious\r\nfor his parents, and wrote to his uncle, Major Wolfe, at Dublin: \"I\r\ntrust you will give the best advice to my mother, and such assistance,\r\nif it should be wanted, as the distance between you will permit. I\r\nmention this because the General seems to decline apace, and narrowly\r\nescaped being carried off in the spring. She, poor woman, is in a bad\r\nstate of health, and needs the care of some friendly hand. She has long\r\nand painful fits of illness, which by succession and inheritance are\r\nlikely to devolve on me, since I feel the early symptoms of them.\" Of\r\nhis friends Guy Carleton, afterwards Lord Dorchester, and George Warde,\r\nthe companion of his boyhood, he also asks help for his mother in his\r\nabsence.\r\n\r\nHis part in the taking of Louisbourg greatly increased his reputation.\r\nAfter his return he went to Bath to recruit his health; and it seems to\r\nhave been here that he wooed and won Miss Katherine Lowther, daughter of\r\nan ex-Governor of Barbadoes, and sister of the future Lord Lonsdale. A\r\nbetrothal took place, and Wolfe wore her portrait till the night before\r\nhis death. It was a little before this engagement that he wrote to his\r\nfriend Lieutenant-Colonel Rickson: \"I have this day signified to Mr.\r\nPitt that he may dispose of my slight carcass as he pleases, and that I\r\nam ready for any undertaking within the compass of my skill and\r\ncunning. I am in a very bad condition both with the gravel and\r\nrheumatism; but I had much rather die than decline any kind of service\r\nthat offers. If I followed my own taste it would lead me into Germany.\r\nHowever, it is not our part to choose, but to obey. My opinion is that I\r\nshall join the army in America.\"\r\n\r\nPitt chose him to command the expedition then fitting out against\r\nQuebec; made him a major-general, though, to avoid giving offence to\r\nolder officers, he was to hold that rank in America alone; and permitted\r\nhim to choose his own staff. Appointments made for merit, and not\r\nthrough routine and patronage, shocked the Duke of Newcastle, to whom a\r\nman like Wolfe was a hopeless enigma; and he told George II. that Pitt's\r\nnew general was mad. \"Mad is he?\" returned the old King; \"then I hope he\r\nwill bite some others of my generals.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of January the fleet was almost ready, and Wolfe wrote to his\r\nuncle Walter: \"I am to act a greater part in this business than I\r\nwished. The backwardness of some of the older officers has in some\r\nmeasure forced the Government to come down so low. I shall do my best,\r\nand leave the rest to fortune, as perforce we must when there are not\r\nthe most commanding abilities. We expect to sail in about three weeks. A\r\nLondon life and little exercise disagrees entirely with me, but the sea\r\nstill more. If I have health and constitution enough for the campaign, I\r\nshall think myself a lucky man; what happens afterwards is of no great\r\nconsequence.\" He sent to his mother an affectionate letter of farewell,\r\nwent to Spithead, embarked with Admiral Saunders in the ship \"Neptune,\"\r\nand set sail on the seventeenth of February. In a few hours the whole\r\nsquadron was at sea, the transports, the frigates, and the great\r\nline-of-battle ships, with their ponderous armament and their freight of\r\nrude humanity armed and trained for destruction; while on the heaving\r\ndeck of the \"Neptune,\" wretched with sea-sickness and racked with pain,\r\nstood the gallant invalid who was master of it all.\r\n\r\nThe fleet consisted of twenty-two ships of the line, with frigates,\r\nsloops-of-war, and a great number of transports. When Admiral Saunders\r\narrived with his squadron off Louisbourg, he found the entrance blocked\r\nby ice, and was forced to seek harborage at Halifax. The squadron of\r\nAdmiral Holmes, which had sailed a few days earlier, proceeded to New\r\nYork to take on board troops destined for the expedition, while the\r\nsquadron of Admiral Durell steered for the St. Lawrence to intercept the\r\nexpected ships from France. In May the whole fleet, except the ten ships\r\nwith Durell, was united in the harbor of Louisbourg. Twelve thousand\r\ntroops were to have been employed for the expedition; but several\r\nregiments expected from the West Indies were for some reason\r\ncountermanded, while the accessions from New York and the Nova Scotia\r\ngarrisons fell far short of the looked-for numbers. Three weeks before\r\nleaving Louisbourg, Wolfe writes to his uncle Walter that he has an army\r\nof nine thousand men. The actual number seems to have been somewhat\r\nless.[697] \"Our troops are good,\" he informs Pitt; \"and if valor can\r\nmake amends for the want of numbers, we shall probably succeed.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 697: See _Grenville Correspondence,_ I. 305.]\r\n\r\nThree brigadiers, all in the early prime of life, held command under\r\nhim: Monckton, Townshend, and Murray. They were all his superiors in\r\nbirth, and one of them, Townshend, never forgot that he was so. \"George\r\nTownshend,\" says Walpole, \"has thrust himself again into the service;\r\nand, as far as wrongheadedness will go, is very proper for a hero.\"[698]\r\nThe same caustic writer says further that he was of \"a proud, sullen,\r\nand contemptuous temper,\" and that he \"saw everything in an ill-natured\r\nand ridiculous light.\"[699] Though his perverse and envious disposition\r\nmade him a difficult colleague, Townshend had both talents and energy;\r\nas also had Monckton, the same officer who commanded at the capture of\r\nBeauséjour in 1755. Murray, too, was well matched to the work in hand,\r\nin spite of some lingering remains of youthful rashness.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 698: Horace Walpole, _Letters_ III. 207 (ed. Cunningham,\r\n1857).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 699: Ibid. _George II._, II. 345.]\r\n\r\nOn the sixth of June the last ship of the fleet sailed out of\r\nLouisbourg harbor, the troops cheering and the officers drinking to the\r\ntoast, \"British colors on every French fort, port, and garrison in\r\nAmerica.\" The ships that had gone before lay to till the whole fleet was\r\nreunited, and then all steered together for the St. Lawrence. From the\r\nheadland of Cape Egmont, the Micmac hunter, gazing far out over the\r\nshimmering sea, saw the horizon flecked with their canvas wings, as they\r\nbore northward on their errand of havoc.\r\n\r\nNOTE: For the material of the foregoing sketch of Wolfe I am indebted to\r\nWright's excellent Life of him and the numerous letters contained in it.\r\nSeveral autograph letters which have escaped the notice of Mr. Wright\r\nare preserved in the Public Record Office. The following is a\r\ncharacteristic passage from one of these, written on board the\r\n\"Neptune,\" at sea, on the sixth of June, the day when the fleet sailed\r\nfrom Louisbourg. It is directed to a nobleman of high rank in the army,\r\nwhose name does not appear, the address being lost (War Office Records:\r\n_North America, various,_ 1756-1763): \"I have had the honour to receive\r\ntwo letters from your Lordship, one of an old date, concerning my stay\r\nin this country [_after the capture of Louisbourg,_] in answer to which\r\nI shall only say that the Marshal told me I was to return at the end of\r\nthe campaign; and as General Amherst had no other commands than to send\r\nme to winter at Halifax under the orders of an officer _[Brigadier\r\nLawrence]_ who was but a few months before put over my head, I thought\r\nit was much better to get into the way of service and out of the way of\r\nbeing insulted; and as the style of your Lordship's letter is pretty\r\nstrong, I must take the liberty to inform you that ... rather than\r\nreceive orders in the Government [_of Nova Scotia_] from an officer\r\nyounger than myself (though a very worthy man), I should certainly have\r\ndesired leave to resign my commission; for as I neither ask nor expect\r\nany favour, so I never intend to submit to any ill-usage whatsoever.\"\r\n\r\nMany other papers in the Public Record Office have been consulted in\r\npreparing the above chapter, including the secret instructions of the\r\nKing to Wolfe and to Saunders, and the letters of Amherst to Wolfe and\r\nto Pitt. Other correspondence touching the same subjects is printed in\r\n_Selections from the Public Documents of Nova Scotia,_ 441-450. Knox,\r\nMante, and Entick are the best contemporary printed sources.\r\n\r\nA story has gained currency respecting the last interview of Wolfe with\r\nPitt, in which he is said to have flourished his sword and boasted of\r\nwhat he would achieve. This anecdote was told by Lord Temple, who was\r\npresent at the interview, to Mr. Grenville, who, many years after, told\r\nit to Earl Stanhope, by whom it was made public. That the incident\r\nunderwent essential changes in the course of these transmissions,--which\r\nextended over more than half a century, for Earl Stanhope was not born\r\ntill 1805,--can never be doubted by one who considers the known\r\ncharacter of Wolfe, who may have uttered some vehement expression, but\r\nwho can never be suspected of gasconade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 25\r\n\r\n1759\r\n\r\nWolfe at Quebec\r\n\r\n\r\nIn early spring the chiefs of Canada met at Montreal to settle a plan of\r\ndefence. What at first they most dreaded was an advance of the enemy by\r\nway of Lake Champlain. Bourlamaque, with three battalions, was ordered\r\nto take post at Ticonderoga, hold it if he could, or, if overborne by\r\nnumbers, fall back to Isle-aux-Noix, at the outlet of the lake. La Corne\r\nwas sent with a strong detachment to intrench himself at the head of the\r\nrapids of the St. Lawrence, and oppose any hostile movement from Lake\r\nOntario. Every able-bodied man in the colony, and every boy who could\r\nfire a gun, was to be called to the field. Vaudreuil sent a circular\r\nletter to the militia captains of all the parishes, with orders to read\r\nit to the parishioners. It exhorted them to defend their religion, their\r\nwives, their children, and their goods from the fury of the heretics;\r\ndeclared that he, the Governor, would never yield up Canada on any terms\r\nwhatever; and ordered them to join the army at once, leaving none behind\r\nbut the old, the sick, the women, and the children.[700] The Bishop\r\nissued a pastoral mandate: \"On every side, dearest brethren, the enemy\r\nis making immense preparations. His forces, at least six times more\r\nnumerous than ours, are already in motion. Never was Canada in a state\r\nso critical and full of peril. Never were we so destitute, or threatened\r\nwith an attack so fierce, so general, and so obstinate. Now, in truth,\r\nwe may say, more than ever before, that our only resource is in the\r\npowerful succor of our Lord. Then, dearest brethren, make every effort\r\nto deserve it. 'Seek first the kingdom of God; and all these things\r\nshall be added unto you.'\" And he reproves their sins, exhorts them to\r\nrepentance, and ordains processions, masses, and prayers.[701]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 700: _Mémoires sur le Canada, 1749-1760_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 701: I am indebted for a copy of this mandate to the kindness\r\nof Abbé Bois. As printed by Knox, it is somewhat different, though the\r\nspirit is the same.]\r\n\r\nVaudreuil bustled and boasted. In May he wrote to the Minister: \"The\r\nzeal with which I am animated for the service of the King will always\r\nmake me surmount the greatest obstacles. I am taking the most proper\r\nmeasures to give the enemy a good reception whenever he may attack us. I\r\nkeep in view the defence of Quebec. I have given orders in the parishes\r\nbelow to muster the inhabitants who are able to bear arms, and place\r\nwomen, children, cattle, and even hay and grain, in places of safety.\r\nPermit me, Monseigneur, to beg you to have the goodness to assure His\r\nMajesty that, to whatever hard extremity I may be reduced, my zeal will\r\nbe equally ardent and indefatigable, and that I shall do the impossible\r\nto prevent our enemies from making progress in any direction, or, at\r\nleast, to make them pay extremely dear for it.\"[702] Then he writes\r\nagain to say that Amherst with a great army will, as he learns, attack\r\nTiconderoga; that Bradstreet, with six thousand men, will advance to\r\nLake Ontario; and that six thousand more will march to the Ohio.\r\n\"Whatever progress they may make,\" he adds, \"I am resolved to yield them\r\nnothing, but hold my ground even to annihilation.\" He promises to do his\r\nbest to keep on good terms with Montcalm, and ends with a warm eulogy of\r\nBigot.[703]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 702: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 8 Mai, 1759._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 703: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 20_ [_?_] _Mai, 1759._]\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of all these preparations that Bougainville arrived\r\nfrom France with news that a great fleet was on its way to attack\r\nQuebec. The town was filled with consternation mixed with surprise, for\r\nthe Canadians had believed that the dangerous navigation of the St.\r\nLawrence would deter their enemies from the attempt. \"Everybody,\" writes\r\none of them, \"was stupefied at an enterprise that seemed so bold.\" In a\r\nfew days a crowd of sails was seen approaching. They were not enemies,\r\nbut friends. It was the fleet of the contractor Cadet, commanded by\r\nofficer named Kanon, and loaded with supplies for the colony. They\r\nanchored in the harbor, eighteen sail in all, and their arrival spread\r\nuniversal joy. Admiral Durell had come too late to intercept them,\r\ncatching but three stragglers that had lagged behind the rest. Still\r\nothers succeeded in eluding him, and before the first of June five more\r\nships had come safely into port.\r\n\r\nWhen the news brought by Bougainville reached Montreal, nearly the whole\r\nforce of the colony, except the detachments of Bourlamaque and La Corne,\r\nwas ordered to Quebec. Montcalm hastened thither, and Vaudreuil\r\nfollowed. The Governor-General wrote to the Minister in his usual\r\nstrain, as if all the hope of Canada rested in him. Such, he says, was\r\nhis activity, that, though very busy, he reached Quebec only a day and a\r\nhalf after Montcalm; and, on arriving, learned from his scouts that\r\nEnglish ships-of-war had already appeared at Isle-aux-Coudres. These\r\nwere the squadron of Durell. \"I expect,\" Vaudreuil goes on, \"to be\r\nsharply attacked, and that our enemies will make their most powerful\r\nefforts to conquer this colony; but there is no ruse, no resource, no\r\nmeans which my zeal does not suggest to lay snares for them, and\r\nfinally, when the exigency demands it, to fight them with an ardor, and\r\neven a fury, which exceeds the range of their ambitious designs. The\r\ntroops, the Canadians, and the Indians are not ignorant of the\r\nresolution I have taken, and from which I shall not recoil under any\r\ncircumstance whatever. The burghers of this city have already put their\r\ngoods and furniture in places of safety. The old men, women, and\r\nchildren hold themselves ready to leave town. My firmness is generally\r\napplauded. It has penetrated every heart; and each man says aloud:\r\n'Canada, our native land, shall bury us under its ruins before we\r\nsurrender to the English!' This is decidedly my own determination, and I\r\nshall hold to it inviolably.\" He launches into high praise of the\r\ncontractor Cadet, whose zeal for the service of the King and the defence\r\nof the colony he declares to be triumphant over every difficulty. It is\r\nnecessary, he adds, that ample supplies of all kinds should be sent out\r\nin the autumn, with the distribution of which Cadet offers to charge\r\nhimself, and to account for them at their first cost; but he does not\r\nsay what prices his disinterested friend will compel the destitute\r\nCanadians to pay for them.[704]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 704: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 28 Mai, 1759_.]\r\n\r\nFive battalions from France, nearly all the colony troops, and the\r\nmilitia from every part of Canada poured into Quebec, along with a\r\nthousand or more Indians, who, at the call of Vaudreuil, came to lend\r\ntheir scalping-knives to the defence. Such was the ardor of the people\r\nthat boys of fifteen and men of eighty were to be seen in the camp.\r\nIsle-aux-Coudres and Isle d'Orléans were ordered to be evacuated, and an\r\nexcited crowd on the rock of Quebec watched hourly for the approaching\r\nfleet. Days passed and weeks passed, yet it did not appear. Meanwhile\r\nVaudreuil held council after council to settle a plan of defence, They\r\nwere strange scenes: a crowd of officers of every rank, mixed pell-mell\r\nin a small room, pushing, shouting, elbowing each other, interrupting\r\neach other; till Montcalm in despair, took each aside after the meeting\r\nwas over, and made him give his opinion in writing.[705]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 705: _Journal du Siége de Québec déposé à la Bibliothêque de\r\nHartwell, en Angleterre_. (Printed at Quebec, 1836.)]\r\n\r\nHe himself had at first proposed to encamp the army on the plains of\r\nAbraham and the meadows of the St. Charles, making that river his line\r\nof defence;[706] but he changed his plan, and, with the concurrence of\r\nVaudreuil, resolved to post his whole force on the St. Lawrence below\r\nthe city, with his right resting on the St. Charles, and his left on the\r\nMontmorenci. Here, accordingly, the troops and militia were stationed as\r\nthey arrived. Early in June, standing at the northeastern brink of the\r\nrock of Quebec, one could have seen the whole position at a glance. On\r\nthe curving shore from the St. Charles to the rocky gorge of the\r\nMontmorenci, a distance of seven or eight miles, the whitewashed\r\ndwellings of the parish of Beauport stretched down the road in a double\r\nchain, and the fields on both sides were studded with tents, huts, and\r\nIndian wigwams. Along the borders of the St. Lawrence, as far as the eye\r\ncould distinguish them, gangs of men were throwing up redoubts,\r\nbatteries, and lines of intrenchment. About midway between the two\r\nextremities of the encampment ran the little river of Beauport; and on\r\nthe rising ground just beyond it stood a large stone house, round which\r\nthe tents were thickly clustered; for here Montcalm had made his\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 706: _Livre d'Ordres, Disposition pour s'opposer à la\r\nDescente_.]\r\n\r\nA boom of logs chained together was drawn across the mouth of the St.\r\nCharles, which was further guarded by two hulks mounted with cannon. The\r\nbridge of boats that crossed the stream nearly a mile above, formed the\r\nchief communication between the city and the camp. Its head towards\r\nBeauport was protected by a strong and extensive earthwork; and the\r\nbanks of the stream on the Quebec side were also intrenched, to form a\r\nsecond line of defence in case the position at Beauport should be\r\nforced.\r\n\r\nIn the city itself every gate, except the Palace Gate, which gave access\r\nto the bridge, was closed and barricaded. A hundred and six cannon were\r\nmounted on the walls.[707] A floating battery of twelve heavy pieces, a\r\nnumber of gunboats, eight fireships, and several firerafts formed the\r\nriver defences. The largest merchantmen of Kanon's fleet were sacrificed\r\nto make the fireships; and the rest, along with the frigates that came\r\nwith them, were sent for safety up the St. Lawrence beyond the River\r\nRichelieu, whence about a thousand of their sailors returned to man the\r\nbatteries and gunboats.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 707: This number was found after the siege. Knox, II. 151.\r\nSome French writers make it much greater.]\r\n\r\nIn the camps along the Beauport shore were about fourteen thousand men,\r\nbesides Indians. The regulars held the centre; the militia of Quebec and\r\nThree Rivers were on the right, and those of Montreal on the left. In\r\nQuebec itself there was a garrison of between one and two thousand men\r\nunder the Chevalier de Ramesay. Thus the whole number, including\r\nIndians, amounted to more than sixteen thousand;[708] and though the\r\nCanadians who formed the greater part of it were of little use in the\r\nopen field, they could be trusted to fight well behind intrenchments.\r\nAgainst this force, posted behind defensive works, on positions almost\r\nimpregnable by nature, Wolfe brought less than nine thousand men\r\navailable for operations on land.[709] The steep and lofty heights that\r\nlined the river made the cannon of the ships for the most part useless,\r\nwhile the exigencies of the naval service forbade employing the sailors\r\non shore. In two or three instances only, throughout the siege, small\r\nsquads of them landed to aid in moving and working cannon; and the\r\nactual fighting fell to the troops alone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 708: See Appendix H.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 709: Ibid.]\r\n\r\nVaudreuil and Bigot took up their quarters with the army. The\r\nGovernor-General had delegated the command of the land-forces to\r\nMontcalm, whom, in his own words, he authorized \"to give orders\r\neverywhere, provisionally.\" His relations with him were more than ever\r\nanomalous and critical; for while Vaudreuil, in virtue of his office,\r\nhad a right to supreme command, Montcalm, now a lieutenant-general, held\r\na military grade far above him; and the Governor, while always writing\r\nhimself down in his despatches as the head and front of every movement,\r\nhad too little self-confidence not to leave the actual command in the\r\nhands of his rival.\r\n\r\nDays and weeks wore on, and the first excitement gave way to restless\r\nimpatience. Why did not the English come? Many of the Canadians thought\r\nthat Heaven would interpose and wreck the English fleet, as it had\r\nwrecked that of Admiral Walker half a century before. There were\r\nprocessions, prayers, and vows towards this happy consummation. Food was\r\nscarce. Bigot and Cadet lived in luxury; fowls by thousands were\r\nfattened with wheat for their tables, while the people were put on\r\nrations of two ounces of bread a day.[710] Durell and his ships were\r\nreported to be still at Isle-aux-Coudres. Vaudreuil sent thither a party\r\nof Canadians, and they captured three midshipmen, who, says Montcalm,\r\nhad gone ashore _pour polissonner,_ that is, on a lark. These youths\r\nwere brought to Quebec, where they increased the general anxiety by\r\ngrossly exaggerating the English force.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 710: _Mémoires sur le Canada, 1749-1760._]\r\n\r\nAt length it became known that eight English vessels were anchored in\r\nthe north channel of Orleans, and on the twenty-first of June the masts\r\nof three of them could plainly be seen. One of the fireships was\r\nconsumed in a vain attempt to burn them, and several firerafts and a\r\nsort of infernal machine were tried with no better success; the\r\nunwelcome visitors still held their posts.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the whole English fleet had slowly advanced, piloted by Denis\r\nde Vitré, a Canadian of good birth, captured at sea some time before,\r\nand now compelled to serve, under a threat of being hanged if he\r\nrefused.[711] Nor was he alone; for when Durell reached the place where\r\nthe river pilots were usually taken on board, he raised a French flag to\r\nhis mast-head, causing great rejoicings among the Canadians on shore,\r\nwho thought that a fleet was come to their rescue, and that their\r\ncountry was saved. The pilots launched their canoes and came out to the\r\nships, where they were all made prisoners; then the French flag was\r\nlowered, and the red cross displayed in its stead. The spectators on\r\nshore turned from joy to despair; and a priest who stood watching the\r\nsquadron with a telescope is said to have dropped dead with the\r\nrevulsion of feeling.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 711: _Mémorial de Jean-Denis de Vitré au Très-honorable\r\nWilliam Pitt._]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of June the main fleet was near the mountain of Cape\r\nTourmente. The passage called the Traverse, between the Cape and the\r\nlower end of the Island of Orleans, was reputed one of the most\r\ndangerous parts of the St. Lawrence; and as the ships successively came\r\nup, the captive pilots were put on board to carry them safely through,\r\non pain of death. One of these men was assigned to the transport\r\n\"Goodwill,\" in which was Captain Knox, who spoke French, and who reports\r\nthus in his Diary: \"He gasconaded at a most extravagant rate, and gave\r\nus to understand that it was much against his will that he was become an\r\nEnglish pilot. The poor fellow assumed great latitude in his\r\nconversation, and said 'he made no doubt that some of the fleet would\r\nreturn to England, but they should have a dismal tale to carry with\r\nthem; for Canada should be the grave of the whole army, and he expected\r\nin a short time to see the walls of Quebec ornamented with English\r\nscalps.' Had it not been in obedience to the Admiral, who gave orders\r\nthat he should not be ill-used, he would certainly have been thrown\r\noverboard.\" The master of the transport was an old sailor named Killick,\r\nwho despised the whole Gallic race, and had no mind to see his ship in\r\ncharge of a Frenchman. \"He would not let the pilot speak,\" continues\r\nKnox, \"but fixed his mate at the helm, charged him not to take orders\r\nfrom any person but himself, and going forwards with his trumpet to the\r\nforecastle, gave the necessary instructions. All that could be said by\r\nthe commanding officer and the other gentlemen on board was to no\r\npurpose; the pilot declared we should be lost, for that no French ship\r\never presumed to pass there without a pilot. 'Ay, ay, my dear,' replied\r\nour son of Neptune, 'but, damn me, I'll convince you that an Englishman\r\nshall go where a Frenchman dare not show his nose.' The \"Richmond\"\r\nfrigate being close astern of us, the commanding officer called out to\r\nthe captain and told him our case; he inquired who the master was, and\r\nwas answered from the forecastle by the man himself, who told him 'he\r\nwas old Killick, and that was enough.' I went forward with this\r\nexperienced mariner, who pointed out the channel to me as we passed;\r\nshowing me by the ripple and color of the water where there was any\r\ndanger, and distinguishing the places where there were ledges of rocks\r\n(to me invisible) from banks of sand, mud, or gravel. He gave his orders\r\nwith great unconcern, joked with the sounding-boats which lay off on\r\neach side with different colored flags for our guidance; and when any of\r\nthem called to him and pointed to the deepest water, he answered: 'Ay,\r\nay, my dear, chalk it down, a damned dangerous navigation, eh! If you\r\ndon't make a sputter about it you'll get no credit in England.' After we\r\nhad cleared this remarkable place, where the channel forms a complete\r\nzigzag, the master called to his mate to give the helm to somebody else,\r\nsaying, 'Damn me if there are not a thousand places in the Thames fifty\r\ntimes more hazardous than this; I am ashamed that Englishmen should make\r\nsuch a rout about it.' The Frenchman asked me if the captain had not\r\nbeen there before. I assured him in the negative; upon which he viewed\r\nhim with great attention, lifting at the same time his hands and eyes to\r\nheaven with astonishment and fervency.\"[712]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 712: Others, as well as the pilot, were astonished. \"The enemy\r\npassed sixty ships of war where we hardly dared risk a vessel of a\r\nhundred tons.\" \"Notwithstanding all our precautions, the English,\r\nwithout any accident, by night, as well as by day, passed through it\r\n[_the Traverse_] their ships of seventy and eighty guns, and even many\r\nof them together.\" _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 22 Oct. 1759_.]\r\n\r\nVaudreuil was blamed for not planting cannon at a certain plateau on the\r\nside of the mountain of Cape Tourmente, where the gunners would have\r\nbeen inaccessible, and whence they could have battered every passing\r\nship with a plunging fire. As it was, the whole fleet sailed safely\r\nthrough. On the twenty-sixth they were all anchored off the south shore\r\nof the Island of Orleans, a few miles from Quebec; and, writes Knox,\r\n\"here we are entertained with a most agreeable prospect of a delightful\r\ncountry on every side; windmills, watermills, churches, chapels, and\r\ncompact farmhouses, all built with stone, and covered, some with wood,\r\nand others with straw. The lands appear to be everywhere well\r\ncultivated; and with the help of my glass I can discern that they are\r\nsowed with flax, wheat, barley, peas, etc., and the grounds are enclosed\r\nwith wooden pales. The weather to-day is agreeably warm. A light fog\r\nsometimes hangs over the highlands, but in the river we have a fine\r\nclear air. In the curve of the river, while we were under sail, we had a\r\ntransient view of a stupendous natural curiosity called the waterfall of\r\nMontmorenci.\"\r\n\r\nThat night Lieutenant Meech, with forty New England rangers, landed on\r\nthe Island of Orleans, and found a body of armed inhabitants, who tried\r\nto surround him. He beat them off, and took possession of a neighboring\r\nfarmhouse, where he remained till daylight; then pursued the enemy, and\r\nfound that they had crossed to the north shore. The whole army now\r\nlanded, and were drawn up on the beach. As they were kept there for some\r\ntime, Knox and several brother officers went to visit the neighboring\r\nchurch of Saint-Laurent, where they found a letter from the parish\r\npriest, directed to \"The Worthy Officers of the British Army,\" praying\r\nthat they would protect the sacred edifice, and also his own adjoining\r\nhouse, and adding, with somewhat needless civility, that he wished they\r\nhad come sooner, that they might have enjoyed the asparagus and radishes\r\nof his garden, now unhappily going to seed. The letter concluded with\r\nmany compliments and good wishes, in which the Britons to whom they were\r\naddressed saw only \"the frothy politeness so peculiar to the French.\"\r\nThe army marched westward and encamped. Wolfe, with his chief engineer,\r\nMajor Mackellar, and an escort of light infantry, advanced to the\r\nextreme point of the island.\r\n\r\nHere he could see, in part, the desperate nature of the task he had\r\nundertaken. Before him, three or four miles away, Quebec sat perched\r\nupon her rock, a congregation of stone houses, churches, palaces,\r\nconvents, and hospitals; the green trees of the Seminary garden and the\r\nspires of the Cathedral, the Ursulines, the Recollets, and the Jesuits.\r\nBeyond rose the loftier height of Cape Diamond, edged with palisades and\r\ncapped with redoubt and parapet. Batteries frowned everywhere; the\r\nChateau battery, the Clergy battery, the Hospital battery, on the rock\r\nabove, and the Royal, Dauphin's, and Queen's batteries on the strand,\r\nwhere the dwellings and warehouses of the lower town clustered beneath\r\nthe cliff.\r\n\r\nFull in sight lay the far-extended camp of Montcalm, stretching from the\r\nSt. Charles, beneath the city walls, to the chasm and cataract of the\r\nMontmorenci. From the cataract to the river of Beauport, its front was\r\ncovered by earthworks along the brink of abrupt and lofty heights; and\r\nfrom the river of Beauport to the St. Charles, by broad flats of mud\r\nswept by the fire of redoubts, intrenchments, a floating battery, and\r\nthe city itself. Above the city, Cape Diamond hid the view; but could\r\nWolfe have looked beyond it, he would have beheld a prospect still more\r\ndisheartening. Here, mile after mile, the St. Lawrence was walled by a\r\nrange of steeps, often inaccessible, and always so difficult that a few\r\nmen at the top could hold an army in check; while at Cap-Rouge, about\r\neight miles distant, the high plateau was cleft by the channel of a\r\nstream which formed a line of defence as strong as that of the\r\nMontmorenci. Quebec was a natural fortress. Bougainville had long before\r\nexamined the position, and reported that \"by the help of intrenchments,\r\neasily and quickly made, and defended by three or four thousand men, I\r\nthink the city would be safe. I do not believe that the English will\r\nmake any attempt against it; but they may have the madness to do so, and\r\nit is well to be prepared against surprise.\"\r\n\r\nNot four thousand men, but four times four thousand, now stood in its\r\ndefence; and their chiefs wisely resolved not to throw away the\r\nadvantages of their position. Nothing more was heard of Vaudreuil's bold\r\nplan of attacking the invaders at their landing; and Montcalm had\r\ndeclared that he would play the part, not of Hannibal, but of Fabius.\r\nHis plan was to avoid a general battle, run no risks, and protract the\r\ndefence till the resources of the enemy were exhausted, or till\r\napproaching winter forced them to withdraw. Success was almost certain\r\nbut for one contingency. Amherst, with a force larger than that of\r\nWolfe, was moving against Ticonderoga. If he should capture it, and\r\nadvance into the colony, Montcalm would be forced to weaken his army by\r\nsending strong detachments to oppose him. Here was Wolfe's best hope.\r\nThis failing, his only chance was in audacity. The game was desperate;\r\nbut, intrepid gamester as he was in war, he was a man, in the last\r\nresort, to stake everything on the cast of the dice.\r\n\r\nThe elements declared for France. On the afternoon of the day when\r\nWolfe's army landed, a violent squall swept over the St. Lawrence,\r\ndashed the ships together, drove several ashore, and destroyed many of\r\nthe flatboats from which the troops had just disembarked. \"I never saw\r\nso much distress among shipping in my whole life,\" writes an officer to\r\na friend in Boston. Fortunately the storm subsided as quickly as it\r\nrose. Vaudreuil saw that the hoped-for deliverance had failed; and as\r\nthe tempest had not destroyed the British fleet, he resolved to try the\r\nvirtue of his fireships. \"I am afraid,\" says Montcalm, \"that they have\r\ncost us a million, and will be good for nothing after all.\" This\r\nremained to be seen. Vaudreuil gave the chief command of them to a naval\r\nofficer named Delouche; and on the evening of the twenty-eighth, after\r\nlong consultation and much debate among their respective captains, they\r\nset sail together at ten o'clock. The night was moonless and dark. In\r\nless than an hour they were at the entrance of the north channel.\r\nDelouche had been all enthusiasm; but as he neared the danger his nerves\r\nfailed, and he set fire to his ship half an hour too soon, the rest\r\nfollowing his example.[713]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 713: Foligny, _Journal mémoratif. Vaudreuil au Ministre, 5\r\nOct. 1759. Journal du Siége_ (Bibliothêque de Hartwell).]\r\n\r\nThere was an English outpost at the Point of Orleans; and, about eleven\r\no'clock, the sentries descried through the gloom the ghostly outlines of\r\nthe approaching ships. As they gazed, these mysterious strangers began\r\nto dart tongues of flame; fire ran like lightning up their masts and\r\nsails, and then they burst out like volcanoes. Filled as they were with\r\npitch, tar, and every manner of combustible, mixed with fireworks,\r\nbombs, grenades, and old cannon, swivels, and muskets loaded to the\r\nthroat, the effect was terrific. The troops at the Point, amazed at the\r\nsudden eruption, the din of the explosions, and the showers of grapeshot\r\nthat rattled among the trees, lost their wits and fled. The blazing\r\ndragons hissed and roared, spouted sheets of fire, vomited smoke in\r\nblack, pitchy volumes and vast illumined clouds, and shed their infernal\r\nglare on the distant city, the tents of Montcalm, and the long red lines\r\nof the British army, drawn up in array of battle, lest the French should\r\ncross from their encampments to attack them in the confusion. Knox calls\r\nthe display \"the grandest fireworks that can possibly be conceived.\" Yet\r\nthe fireships did no other harm than burning alive one of their own\r\ncaptains and six or seven of his sailors who failed to escape in their\r\nboats. Some of them ran ashore before reaching the fleet; the others\r\nwere seized by the intrepid English sailors, who, approaching in their\r\nboats, threw grappling-irons upon them and towed them towards land, till\r\nthey swung round and stranded. Here, after venting their fury for a\r\nwhile, they subsided into quiet conflagration, which lasted till\r\nmorning. Vaudreuil watched the result of his experiment from the steeple\r\nof the church at Beauport; then returned, dejected, to Quebec.\r\n\r\nWolfe longed to fight his enemy; but his sagacious enemy would not\r\ngratify him. From the heights of Beauport, the rock of Quebec, or the\r\nsummit of Cape Diamond, Montcalm could look down on the river and its\r\nshores as on a map, and watch each movement of the invaders. He was\r\nhopeful, perhaps confident; and for a month or more he wrote almost\r\ndaily to Bourlamaque at Ticonderoga, in a cheerful, and often a jocose\r\nvein, mingling orders and instructions with pleasantries and bits of\r\nnews. Yet his vigilance was unceasing. \"We pass every night in bivouac,\r\nor else sleep in our clothes. Perhaps you are doing as much, my dear\r\nBourlamaque.\"[714]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 714: _Montcalm à Bourlamaque, 27 Juin, 1759._ All these\r\nletters are before me.]\r\n\r\nOf the two commanders, Vaudreuil was the more sanguine, and professed\r\nfull faith that all would go well. He too corresponded with Bourlamaque,\r\nto whom he gave his opinion, founded on the reports of deserters, that\r\nWolfe had no chance of success unless Amherst should come to his aid.\r\nThis he pronounced impossible; and he expressed a strong desire that the\r\nEnglish would attack him, \"so that we may rid ourselves of them at\r\nonce.\"[715] He was courageous, except in the immediate presence of\r\ndanger, and failed only when the crisis came.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 715: _Vaudreuil à Bourlamaque, 8 Juillet, 1759._]\r\n\r\nWolfe, held in check at every other point, had one movement in his\r\npower. He could seize the heights of Point Levi, opposite the city; and\r\nthis, along with his occupation of the Island of Orleans, would give him\r\ncommand of the Basin of Quebec. Thence also he could fire on the place\r\nacross the St. Lawrence, which is here less than a mile wide. The\r\nmovement was begun on the afternoon of the twenty-ninth, when, shivering\r\nin a north wind and a sharp frost, a part of Monckton's brigade was\r\nferried over to Beaumont, on the south shore, and the rest followed in\r\nthe morning. The rangers had a brush with a party of Canadians, whom\r\nthey drove off, and the regulars then landed unopposed. Monckton ordered\r\na proclamation, signed by Wolfe, to be posted on the door of the parish\r\nchurch. It called on the Canadians, in peremptory terms, to stand\r\nneutral in the contest, promised them, if they did so, full protection\r\nin property and religion, and threatened that, if they presumed to\r\nresist the invaders, their houses, goods, and harvests should be\r\ndestroyed, and their churches despoiled. As soon as the troops were out\r\nof sight the inhabitants took down the placard and carried it to\r\nVaudreuil.\r\n\r\nThe brigade marched along the river road to Point Levi, drove off a body\r\nof French and Indians posted in the church, and took possession of the\r\nhouses and the surrounding heights. In the morning they were intrenching\r\nthemselves, when they were greeted by a brisk fire from the edge of the\r\nwoods. It came from a party of Indians, whom the rangers presently put\r\nto flight, and, imitating their own ferocity, scalped nine of them.\r\nWolfe came over to the camp on the next day, went with an escort to the\r\nheights opposite Quebec, examined it with a spy-glass, and chose a\r\nposition from which to bombard it. Cannon and mortars were brought\r\nashore, fascines and gabions made, intrenchments thrown up, and\r\nbatteries planted. Knox came over from the main camp, and says that he\r\nhad \"a most agreeable view of the city of Quebec. It is a very fair\r\nobject for our artillery, particularly the lower town.\" But why did\r\nWolfe wish to bombard it? Its fortifications were but little exposed to\r\nhis fire, and to knock its houses, convents, and churches to pieces\r\nwould bring him no nearer to his object. His guns at Point Levi could\r\ndestroy the city, but could not capture it; yet doubtless they would\r\nhave good moral effect, discourage the French, and cheer his own\r\nsoldiers with the flattering belief that they were achieving something.\r\n\r\nThe guns of Quebec showered balls and bombs upon his workmen; but they\r\nstill toiled on, and the French saw the fatal batteries fast growing to\r\ncompletion. The citizens, alarmed at the threatened destruction, begged\r\nthe Governor for leave to cross the river and dislodge their assailants.\r\nAt length he consented. A party of twelve or fifteen hundred was made up\r\nof armed burghers, Canadians from the camp, a few Indians, some pupils\r\nof the Seminary, and about a hundred volunteers from the regulars.\r\nDumas, an experienced officer, took command of them; and, going up to\r\nSillery, they crossed the river on the night of the twelfth of July.\r\nThey had hardly climbed the heights of the south shore when they grew\r\nexceedingly nervous, though the enemy was still three miles off. The\r\nSeminary scholars fired on some of their own party, whom they mistook\r\nfor English; and the same mishap was repeated a second and a third time.\r\nA panic seized the whole body, and Dumas could not control them. They\r\nturned and made for their canoes, rolling over each other as they rushed\r\ndown the heights, and reappeared at Quebec at six in the morning,\r\noverwhelmed with despair and shame.[716]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 716: _Événements de la Guerre en Canada_ (Hist. Soc. Quebec,\r\n1861). _Mémoires sur le Canada, 1749-1760. Vaudreuil au Ministre, 5 Oct.\r\n1759. L'Abeille_, II. No. 14 (a publication of the Quebec Seminary).\r\n_Journal du Siége de Québec_ (Bibliothêque de Hartwell). Panet, _Journal\r\ndu Siége_. Foligny, _Journal mémoratif. Memoirs of the Siege of Quebec,\r\nby John Johnson, Clerk and Quartermaster-Sergeant to the Fifty-eighth\r\nRegiment_.]\r\n\r\nThe presentiment of the unhappy burghers proved too true. The English\r\nbatteries fell to their work, and the families of the town fled to the\r\ncountry for safety. In a single day eighteen houses and the cathedral\r\nwere burned by exploding shells; and fiercer and fiercer the storm of\r\nfire and iron hailed upon Quebec.\r\n\r\nWolfe did not rest content with distressing his enemy. With an ardor and\r\na daring that no difficulties could cool, he sought means to strike an\r\neffective blow. It was nothing to lay Quebec in ruins if he could not\r\ndefeat the army that protected it. To land from boats and attack\r\nMontcalm in front, through the mud of the Beauport flats or up the\r\nheights along the neighboring shore, was an enterprise too rash even for\r\nhis temerity. It might, however, be possible to land below the cataract\r\nof Montmorenci, cross that stream higher up, and strike the French army\r\nin flank or rear; and he had no sooner secured his positions at the\r\npoints of Levi and Orleans, than he addressed himself to this attempt.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth several frigates and a bomb-ketch took their stations\r\nbefore the camp of the Chevalier de Lévis, who, with his division of\r\nCanadian militia, occupied the heights along the St. Lawrence just above\r\nthe cataract. Here they shelled and cannonaded him all day; though, from\r\nhis elevated position, with very little effect. Towards evening the\r\ntroops on the Point of Orleans broke up their camp. Major Hardy, with a\r\ndetachment of marines, was left to hold that post, while the rest\r\nembarked at night in the boats of the fleet. They were the brigades of\r\nTownshend and Murray, consisting of five battalions, with a body of\r\ngrenadiers, light infantry, and rangers,--in all three thousand men.\r\nThey landed before daybreak in front of the parish of L'Ange Gardien, a\r\nlittle below the cataract. The only opposition was from a troop of\r\nCanadians and Indians, whom they routed, after some loss, climbed the\r\nheights, gained the plateau above, and began to intrench themselves. A\r\ncompany of rangers, supported by detachments of regulars, was sent into\r\nthe neighboring forest to protect the parties who were cutting fascines,\r\nand apparently, also, to look for a fording-place.\r\n\r\nLévis, with his Scotch-Jacobite aide-de-camp, Johnstone, had watched the\r\nmovements of Wolfe from the heights across the cataract. Johnstone says\r\nthat he asked his commander if he was sure there was no ford higher up\r\non the Montmorenci, by which the English could cross. Lévis averred that\r\nthere was none, and that he himself had examined the stream to its\r\nsource; on which a Canadian who stood by whispered to the aide-de-camp:\r\n\"The General is mistaken; there is a ford.\" Johnstone told this to\r\nLévis, who would not believe it, and so browbeat the Canadian that he\r\ndared not repeat what he had said. Johnstone, taking him aside, told him\r\nto go and find somebody who had lately crossed the ford, and bring him\r\nat once to the General's quarters; whereupon he soon reappeared with a\r\nman who affirmed that he had crossed it the night before with a sack of\r\nwheat on his back. A detachment was immediately sent to the place, with\r\norders to intrench itself, and Repentigny, lieutenant of Lévis, was\r\nposted not far off with eleven hundred Canadians.\r\n\r\nFour hundred Indians passed the ford under the partisan Langlade,\r\ndiscovered Wolfe's detachment, hid themselves, and sent their commander\r\nto tell Repentigny that there was a body of English in the forest, who\r\nmight all be destroyed if he would come over at once with his Canadians.\r\nRepentigny sent for orders to Lévis, and Lévis sent for orders to\r\nVaudreuil, whose quarters were three or four miles distant. Vaudreuil\r\nanswered that no risk should be run, and that he would come and see to\r\nthe matter himself. It was about two hours before he arrived; and\r\nmeanwhile the Indians grew impatient, rose from their hiding-place,\r\nfired on the rangers, and drove them back with heavy loss upon the\r\nregulars, who stood their ground, and at last repulsed the assailants.\r\nThe Indians recrossed the ford with thirty-six scalps. If Repentigny had\r\nadvanced, and Lévis had followed with his main body, the consequences to\r\nthe English might have been serious; for, as Johnstone remarks, \"a\r\nCanadian in the woods is worth three disciplined soldiers, as a soldier\r\nin a plain is worth three Canadians.\" Vaudreuil called a council of war.\r\nThe question was whether an effort should be made to dislodge Wolfe's\r\nmain force. Montcalm and the Governor were this time of one mind, and\r\nboth thought it inexpedient to attack, with militia, a body of regular\r\ntroops whose numbers and position were imperfectly known. Bigot gave his\r\nvoice for the attack. He was overruled, and Wolfe was left to fortify\r\nhimself in peace.[717]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 717: The above is from a comparison of the rather discordant\r\naccounts of Johnstone, the _Journal tenu à l'Armée,_ the _Journal_ of\r\nPanet, and that of the Hartwell Library. The last says that Lévis\r\ncrossed the Montmorenci. If so, he accomplished nothing. This affair\r\nshould not be confounded with a somewhat similar one which took place on\r\nthe 26th.]\r\n\r\nHis occupation of the heights of Montmorenci exposed him to great risks.\r\nThe left wing of his army at Point Levi was six miles from its right\r\nwing at the cataract, and Major Hardy's detachment on the Point of\r\nOrleans was between them, separated from each by a wide arm of the St.\r\nLawrence. Any one of the three camps might be overpowered before the\r\nothers could support it; and Hardy with his small force was above all in\r\ndanger of being cut to pieces. But the French kept persistently on the\r\ndefensive; and after the failure of Dumas to dislodge the English from\r\nPoint Levi, Vaudreuil would not hear of another such attempt. Wolfe was\r\nsoon well intrenched; but it was easier to defend himself than to strike\r\nat his enemy. Montcalm, when urged to attack him, is said to have\r\nanswered: \"Let him amuse himself where he is. If we drive him off he may\r\ngo to some place where he can do us harm.\" His late movement, however,\r\nhad a discouraging effect on the Canadians, who now for the first time\r\nbegan to desert. His batteries, too, played across the chasm of\r\nMontmorenci upon the left wing of the French army with an effect\r\nextremely annoying.\r\n\r\nThe position of the hostile forces was a remarkable one. They were\r\nseparated by the vast gorge that opens upon the St. Lawrence; an\r\namphitheatre of lofty precipices, their brows crested with forests, and\r\ntheir steep brown sides scantily feathered with stunted birch and fir.\r\nInto this abyss leaps the Montmorenci with one headlong plunge of nearly\r\ntwo hundred and fifty feet, a living column of snowy white, with its\r\nspray, its foam, its mists, and its rainbows; then spreads itself in\r\nbroad thin sheets over a floor of rock and gravel, and creeps tamely to\r\nthe St. Lawrence. It was but a gunshot across the gulf, and the\r\nsentinels on each side watched each other over the roar and turmoil of\r\nthe cataract. Captain Knox, coming one day from Point Levi to receive\r\norders from Wolfe, improved a spare hour to visit this marvel of nature.\r\n\"I had very nigh paid dear for my inquisitiveness; for while I stood on\r\nthe eminence I was hastily called to by one of our sentinels, when,\r\nthrowing my eyes about, I saw a Frenchman creeping under the eastern\r\nextremity of their breastwork to fire at me. This obliged me to retire\r\nas fast as I could out of his reach, and, making up to the sentry to\r\nthank him for his attention, he told me the fellow had snapped his piece\r\ntwice, and the second time it flashed in the pan at the instant I turned\r\naway from the Fall.\" Another officer, less fortunate, had a leg broken\r\nby a shot from the opposite cliffs.\r\n\r\nDay after day went by, and the invaders made no progress. Flags of truce\r\npassed often between the hostile camps. \"You will demolish the town, no\r\ndoubt,\" said the bearer of one of them, \"but you shall never get inside\r\nof it.\" To which Wolfe replied: \"I will have Quebec if I stay here till\r\nthe end of November.\" Sometimes the heat was intense, and sometimes\r\nthere were floods of summer rain that inundated the tents. Along the\r\nriver, from the Montmorenci to Point Levi, there were ceaseless\r\nartillery fights between gunboats, frigates, and batteries on shore.\r\nBands of Indians infested the outskirts of the camps, killing sentries\r\nand patrols. The rangers chased them through the woods; there were brisk\r\nskirmishes, and scalps lost and won. Sometimes the regulars took part in\r\nthese forest battles; and once it was announced, in orders of the day,\r\nthat \"the General has ordered two sheep and some rum to Captain Cosnan's\r\ncompany of grenadiers for the spirit they showed this morning in pushing\r\nthose scoundrels of Indians.\" The Indians complained that the British\r\nsoldiers were learning how to fight, and no longer stood still in a mass\r\nto be shot at, as in Braddock's time. The Canadian _coureurs-de-bois_\r\nmixed with their red allies and wore their livery. One of them was\r\ncaught on the eighteenth. He was naked, daubed red and blue, and adorned\r\nwith a bunch of painted feathers dangling from the top of his head. He\r\nand his companions used the scalping-knife as freely as the Indians\r\nthemselves; nor were the New England rangers much behind them in this\r\nrespect, till an order came from Wolfe forbidding \"the inhuman practice\r\nof scalping, except when the enemy are Indians, or Canadians dressed\r\nlike Indians.\"\r\n\r\nA part of the fleet worked up into the Basin, beyond the Point of\r\nOrleans; and here, on the warm summer nights, officers and men watched\r\nthe cannon flashing and thundering from the heights of Montmorenci on\r\none side, and those of Pont Levi on the other, and the bombs sailing\r\nthrough the air in fiery semicircles. Often the gloom was lighted up by\r\nthe blaze of the burning houses of Quebec, kindled by incendiary shells.\r\nBoth the lower and the upper town were nearly deserted by the\r\ninhabitants, some retreating into the country, and some into the suburb\r\nof St. Roch; while the Ursulines and Hospital nuns abandoned their\r\nconvents to seek harborage beyond the range of shot. The city was a prey\r\nto robbers, who pillaged the empty houses, till an order came from\r\nheadquarters promising the gallows to all who should be caught. News\r\nreached the French that Niagara was attacked, and that the army of\r\nAmherst was moving against Ticonderoga. The Canadians deserted more and\r\nmore. They were disheartened by the defensive attitude in which both\r\nVaudreuil and Montcalm steadily persisted; and accustomed as they were\r\nto rapid raids, sudden strokes, and a quick return to their homes, they\r\ntired of long weeks of inaction. The English patrols caught one of them\r\nas he was passing the time in fishing. \"He seemed to be a subtle old\r\nrogue,\" says Knox, \"of seventy years of age, as he told us. We plied him\r\nwell with port wine, and then his heart was more open; and seeing that\r\nwe laughed at the exaggerated accounts he had given us, he said he\r\n'wished the affair was well over, one way or the other; that his\r\ncountrymen were all discontented, and would either surrender, or\r\ndisperse and act a neutral part, if it were not for the persuasions of\r\ntheir priests and the fear of being maltreated by the savages, with whom\r\nthey are threatened on all occasions.'\" A deserter reported on the\r\nnineteenth of July that nothing but dread of the Indians kept the\r\nCanadians in the camp.\r\n\r\nWolfe's proclamation, at first unavailing, was now taking effect. A\r\nlarge number of Canadian prisoners, brought in on the twenty-fifth,\r\ndeclared that their countrymen would gladly accept his offers but for\r\nthe threats of their commanders that if they did so the Indians should\r\nbe set upon them. The prisoners said further that \"they had been under\r\napprehension for several days past of having a body of four hundred\r\nbarbarians sent to rifle their parish and habitations.\"[718] Such\r\nthreats were not wholly effectual. A French chronicler of the time says:\r\n\"The Canadians showed their disgust every day, and deserted at every\r\nopportunity, in spite of the means taken to prevent them.\" \"The people\r\nwere intimidated, seeing all our army kept in one body and solely on the\r\ndefensive; while the English, though far less numerous, divided their\r\nforces, and undertook various bold enterprises without meeting\r\nresistance.\"[719]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 718: Knox, I. 347; compare pp. 339, 341, 346.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 719: _Journal du Siége_ (Bibliothêque de Hartwell).]\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth the English accomplished a feat which promised\r\nimportant results. The French commanders had thought it impossible for\r\nany hostile ship to pass the batteries of Quebec; but about eleven\r\no'clock at night, favored by the wind, and covered by a furious\r\ncannonade from Point Levi, the ship \"Sutherland,\" with a frigate and\r\nseveral small vessels, sailed safely by and reached the river above the\r\ntown. Here they at once attacked and destroyed a fireship and some small\r\ncraft that they found there, Now, for the first time, it became\r\nnecessary for Montcalm to weaken his army at Beauport by sending six\r\nhundred men, under Dumas, to defend the accessible points in the line of\r\nprecipices between Quebec and Cap-Rouge. Several hundred more were sent\r\non the next day, when it became known that the English had dragged a\r\nfleet of boats over Point Levi, launched them above the town, and\r\ndespatched troops to embark in them. Thus a new feature was introduced\r\ninto the siege operations, and danger had risen on a side where the\r\nFrench thought themselves safe. On the other hand, Wolfe had become more\r\nvulnerable than ever. His army was now divided, not into three parts,\r\nbut into four, each so far from the rest that, in case of sudden attack,\r\nit must defend itself alone. That Montcalm did not improve his\r\nopportunity was apparently due to want of confidence in his militia.\r\n\r\nThe force above the town did not lie idle. On the night of the\r\ntwentieth, Colonel Carleton, with six hundred men, rowed eighteen miles\r\nup the river, and landed at Pointe-aux-Trembles, on the north shore.\r\nHere some of the families of Quebec had sought asylum; and Wolfe had\r\nbeen told by prisoners that not only were stores in great quantity to be\r\nfound here, but also letters and papers throwing light on the French\r\nplans. Carleton and his men drove off a band of Indians who fired on\r\nthem, and spent a quiet day around the parish church; but found few\r\npapers, and still fewer stores. They withdrew towards evening, carrying\r\nwith them nearly a hundred women, children, and old men; any they were\r\nno sooner gone than the Indians returned to plunder the empty houses of\r\ntheir unfortunate allies. The prisoners were treated with great\r\nkindness. The ladies among them were entertained at supper by Wolfe, who\r\njested with them on the caution of the French generals, saying: \"I have\r\ngiven good chances to attack me, and am surprised that they have not\r\nprofited by them.\"[720] On the next day the prisoners were all sent to\r\nQuebec under a flag of truce.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 720: _Journal tenu à l'Armée que commandoit feu M. le Marquis\r\nde Montcalm._]\r\n\r\nThus far Wolfe had refrained from executing the threats he had affixed\r\nthe month before to the church of Beaumont. But now he issued another\r\nproclamation. It declared that the Canadians had shown themselves\r\nunworthy of the offers he had made them, and that he had therefore\r\nordered his light troops to ravage their country and bring them\r\nprisoners to his camp. Such of the Canadian militia as belonged to the\r\nparishes near Quebec were now in a sad dilemma; for Montcalm threatened\r\nthem on one side, and Wolfe on the other. They might desert to their\r\nhomes, or they might stand by their colors; in the one case their houses\r\nwere to be burned by French savages, and in the other by British light\r\ninfantry.\r\n\r\nWolfe at once gave orders in accord with his late proclamation; but he\r\ncommanded that no church should be profaned, and no woman or child\r\ninjured. The first effects of his stern policy are thus recorded by\r\nKnox: \"Major Dalling's light infantry brought in this afternoon to our\r\ncamp two hundred and fifty male and female prisoners. Among this number\r\nwas a very respectable looking priest, and about forty men fit to bear\r\narms. There was almost an equal number of black cattle, with about\r\nseventy sheep and lambs, and a few horses. Brigadier Monckton\r\nentertained the reverend father and some other fashionable personages in\r\nhis tent, and most humanely ordered refreshments to all the rest of the\r\ncaptives; which noble example was followed by the soldiery, who\r\ngenerously crowded about those unhappy people, sharing the provisions,\r\nrum, and tobacco with them. They were sent in the evening on board of\r\ntransports in the river.\" Again, two days later: \"Colonel Fraser's\r\ndetachment returned this morning, and presented us with more scenes of\r\ndistress and the dismal consequences of war, by a great number of\r\nwretched families, whom they brought in prisoners, with some of their\r\neffects, and near three hundred black cattle, sheep, hogs, and horses.\"\r\n\r\nOn the next night the attention of the excellent journalist was\r\notherwise engaged. Vaudreuil tried again to burn the English fleet.\r\n\"Late last night,\" writes Knox, under date of the twenty-eighth, \"the\r\nenemy sent down a most formidable fireraft, which consisted of a parcel\r\nof schooners, shallops, and stages chained together. It could not be\r\nless than a hundred fathoms in length, and was covered with grenades,\r\nold swivels, gun and pistol barrels loaded up to their muzzles, and\r\nvarious other inventions and combustible matters. This seemed to be\r\ntheir last attempt against our fleet, which happily miscarried, as\r\nbefore; for our gallant seamen, with their usual expertness, grappled\r\nthem before they got down above a third part of the Basin, towed them\r\nsafe to shore, and left them at anchor, continually repeating, _All's\r\nwell_. A remarkable expression from some of these intrepid souls to\r\ntheir comrades on this occasion I must not omit, on account of its\r\nsingular uncouthness; namely: 'Damme, Jack, didst thee ever take hell in\r\ntow before?'\"\r\n\r\nAccording to a French account, this aquatic infernal machine consisted\r\nof seventy rafts, boats, and schooners. Its failure was due to no\r\nshortcoming on the part of its conductors; who, under a brave Canadian\r\nnamed Courval, acted with coolness and resolution. Nothing saved the\r\nfleet but the courage of the sailors, swarming out in their boats to\r\nfight the approaching conflagration.\r\n\r\nIt was now the end of July. More than half the summer was gone, and\r\nQuebec seemed as far as ever beyond the grasp of Wolfe. Its buildings\r\nwere in ruins, and the neighboring parishes were burned and ravaged; but\r\nits living rampart, the army of Montcalm, still lay in patient defiance\r\nalong the shores of Beauport, while above the city every point where a\r\nwildcat could climb the precipices was watched and guarded, and Dumas\r\nwith a thousand men held the impregnable heights of Cap-Rouge. Montcalm\r\npersisted in doing nothing that his enemy wished him to do. He would not\r\nfight on Wolfe's terms, and Wolfe resolved at last to fight him on his\r\nown; that is, to attack his camp in front.\r\n\r\nThe plan was desperate; for, after leaving troops enough to hold Point\r\nLevi and the heights of Montmorenci, less than five thousand men would\r\nbe left to attack a position of commanding strength, where Montcalm at\r\nan hour's notice could collect twice as many to oppose them. But Wolfe\r\nhad a boundless trust in the disciplined valor of his soldiers, and an\r\nutter scorn of the militia who made the greater part of his enemy's\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nTowards the Montmorenci the borders of the St. Lawrence are, as we have\r\nseen, extremely high and steep. At a mile from the gorge of the cataract\r\nthere is, at high tide, a strand, about the eighth of a mile wide,\r\nbetween the foot of these heights and the river; and beyond this strand\r\nthe receding tide lays bare a tract of mud nearly half a mile wide. At\r\nthe edge of the dry ground the French had built a redoubt mounted with\r\ncannon, and there were other similar works on the strand a quarter of a\r\nmile nearer the cataract. Wolfe could not see from the river that these\r\nredoubts were commanded by the musketry of the intrenchments along the\r\nbrink of the heights above. These intrenchments were so constructed that\r\nthey swept with cross-fires the whole face of the declivity, which was\r\ncovered with grass, and was very steep. Wolfe hoped that, if he attacked\r\none of the redoubts, the French would come down to defend it, and so\r\nbring on a general engagement; or, if they did not, that he should gain\r\nan opportunity of reconnoitring the heights to find some point where\r\nthey could be stormed with a chance of success.\r\n\r\nIn front of the gorge of the Montmorenci there was a ford during several\r\nhours of low tide, so that troops from the adjoining English camp might\r\ncross to co-operate with their comrades landing in boats from Point Levi\r\nand the Island of Orleans. On the morning of the thirty-first of July,\r\nthe tide then being at the flood, the French saw the ship \"Centurion,\"\r\nof sixty-four guns, anchor near the Montmorenci and open fire on the\r\nredoubts. Then two armed transports, each of fourteen guns, stood in as\r\nclose as possible to the first redoubt and fired upon it, stranding as\r\nthe tide went out, till in the afternoon they lay bare upon the mud. At\r\nthe same time a battery of more than forty heavy pieces, planted on the\r\nlofty promontory beyond the Montmorenci, began a furious cannonade upon\r\nthe flank of the French intrenchments. It did no great harm, however,\r\nfor the works were protected by a great number of traverses, which\r\nstopped the shot; and the Canadians, who manned this part of the lines,\r\nheld their ground with excellent steadiness.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven o'clock a fleet of boats filled with troops, chiefly from\r\nPoint Levi, appeared in the river and hovered off the shore west of the\r\nparish church of Beauport, as if meaning to land there. Montcalm was\r\nperplexed, doubting whether the real attack was to be made here, or\r\ntoward the Montmorenci. Hour after hour the boats moved to and fro, to\r\nincrease his doubts and hide the real design; but he soon became\r\nconvinced that the camp of Lévis at the Montmorenci was the true object\r\nof his enemy; and about two o'clock he went thither, greeted as he rode\r\nalong the lines by shouts of _Vive notre Général!_ Lévis had already\r\nmade preparations for defence with his usual skill. His Canadians were\r\nreinforced by the battalions of Béarn, Guienne, and Royal Roussillon;\r\nand, as the intentions of Wolfe became certain, the right of the camp\r\nwas nearly abandoned, the main strength of the army being gathered\r\nbetween the river of Beauport and the Montmorenci, where, according to a\r\nFrench writer, there were, towards the end of the afternoon, about\r\ntwelve thousand men.[721]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 721: Panet, _Journal_.]\r\n\r\nAt half-past five o'clock the tide was out, and the crisis came. The\r\nbatteries across the Montmorenci, the distant batteries of Point Levi,\r\nthe cannon of the \"Centurion,\" and those of the two stranded ships, all\r\nopened together with redoubled fury. The French batteries replied; and,\r\namid this deafening roar of artillery, the English boats set their\r\ntroops ashore at the edge of the broad tract of sedgy mud that the\r\nreceding river had left bare. At the same time a column of two thousand\r\nmen was seen, a mile away, moving in perfect order across the\r\nMontmorenci ford. The first troops that landed from the boats were\r\nthirteen companies of grenadiers and a detachment of Royal Americans.\r\nThey dashed swiftly forward; while at some distance behind came\r\nMonckton's brigade, composed of the fifteenth, or Amherst's regiment,\r\nand the seventy-eighth, or Fraser's Highlanders. The day had been fair\r\nand warm; but the sky was now thick with clouds, and large rain-drops\r\nbegan to fall, the precursors of a summer storm.\r\n\r\nWith the utmost precipitation, without orders, and without waiting for\r\nMonckton's brigade to come up, the grenadiers in front made a rush for\r\nthe redoubt near the foot of the hill. The French abandoned it; but the\r\nassailants had no sooner gained their prize than the thronged heights\r\nabove blazed with musketry, and a tempest of bullets fell among them.\r\nNothing daunted, they dashed forward again, reserving their fire, and\r\nstruggling to climb the steep ascent; while, with yells and shouts of\r\n_Vive le Roi!_ the troops and Canadians at the top poured upon them a\r\nhailstorm of musket-balls and buckshot, and dead and wounded in numbers\r\nrolled together down the slope. At that instant the clouds burst, and\r\nthe rain fell in torrents. \"We could not see half way down the hill,\"\r\nsays the Chevalier Johnstone, who was at this part of the line.\r\nAmmunition was wet on both sides, and the grassy steeps became so\r\nslippery that was impossible to climb them. The English say that the\r\nstorm saved the French; the French, with as much reason, that it saved\r\nthe English.\r\n\r\nThe baffled grenadiers drew back into the redoubt. Wolfe saw the madness\r\nof persisting, and ordered a retreat. The rain ceased, and troops of\r\nIndians came down the heights to scalp the fallen. Some of them ran\r\ntowards Lieutenant Peyton, of the Royal Americans, as he lay disabled by\r\na musket-shot. With his double-barrelled gun he brought down two of his\r\nassailants, when a Highland sergeant snatched him in his arms, dragged\r\nhim half a mile over the mud-flats, and placed him in one of the boats.\r\nA friend of Peyton, Captain Ochterlony, had received a mortal wound, and\r\nan Indian would have scalped him but for the generous intrepidity of a\r\nsoldier of the battalion of Guienne; who, seizing the enraged savage,\r\nheld him back till several French officers interposed, and had the dying\r\nman carried to a place of safety.\r\n\r\nThe English retreated in good order, after setting fire to the two\r\nstranded vessels. Those of the grenadiers and Royal Americans who were\r\nleft alive rowed for the Point of Orleans; the fifteenth regiment rowed\r\nfor Point Levi; and the Highlanders, led by Wolfe himself, joined the\r\ncolumn from beyond the Montmorenci, placing themselves in its rear as it\r\nslowly retired along the flats and across the ford, the Indians yelling\r\nand the French shouting from the heights, while the British waved their\r\nhats, daring them to come down and fight.\r\n\r\nThe grenadiers and the Royal Americans, who had borne the brunt of the\r\nfray, bore also nearly all the loss; which, in proportion to their\r\nnumbers, was enormous. Knox reports it at four hundred and forty-three,\r\nkilled, wounded, and missing, including one colonel, eight captains,\r\ntwenty-one lieutenants, and three ensigns.\r\n\r\nVaudreuil, delighted, wrote to Bourlamaque an account of the affair. \"I\r\nhave no more anxiety about Quebec. M. Wolfe, I can assure you, will make\r\nno progress. Luckily for him, his prudence saved him from the\r\nconsequences of his mad enterprise, and he contented himself with losing\r\nabout five hundred of his best soldiers. Deserters say that he will try\r\nus again in a few days. That is what we want; he'll find somebody to\r\ntalk to (_il trouvera à qui parler_).\"\r\n\r\nNOTE: Among the killed in this affair was Edward Botwood, sergeant in\r\nthe grenadiers of the forty-seventh, or Lascelles' regiment. \"Ned\r\nBotwood\" was well known among his comrades as a poet; and the following\r\nlines of his, written on the eve of the expedition to Quebec, continued\r\nto be favorites with the British troops during the War of the Revolution\r\n(see _Historical Magazine_, II., First Series, 164). It may be observed\r\nhere that the war produced a considerable quantity of indifferent verse\r\non both sides. On that of the English it took the shape of occasional\r\nballads, such as \"Bold General Wolfe,\" printed on broadsides, or of\r\npatriotic effusions scattered through magazines and newspapers, while\r\nthe French celebrated all their victories with songs.\r\n\r\nHOT STUFF.\r\n\r\nAir,--Lilies of France.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Come, each death-doing dog who dares venture his neck,\r\n    Come, follow the hero that goes to Quebec;\r\n    Jump aboard of the transports, and loose every sail,\r\n    Pay your debts at the tavern by giving leg-bail;\r\n    And ye that love fighting shall soon have enough:\r\n    Wolfe commands us, my boys; we shall give them Hot Stuff.\r\n\r\n    Up the River St. Lawrence our troops shall advance,\r\n    To the Grenadiers' March we will teach them to dance.\r\n    Cape Breton we have taken, and next we will try\r\n    At their capital to give them another black eye.\r\n    Vaudreuil 't is in vain you pretend to look gruff,--\r\n    Those are coming who know how to give you Hot Stuff.\r\n\r\n    With powder in his periwig, and snuff in his nose,\r\n    Monsieur will run down our descent to oppose;\r\n    And the Indians will come: but the light infantry\r\n    Will soon oblige _them_ to betake to a tree.\r\n    From such rascals as these may we fear a rebuff?\r\n    Advance, grenadiers, and let fly your Hot Stuff!\r\n\r\n    When the forty-seventh regiment is dashing ashore,\r\n    While bullets are whistling and cannons do roar,\r\n    Says Montcalm: \"Those are Shirley's--I know the lappels.\"\r\n    \"You lie,\" says Ned Botwood, \"we belong to Lascelles'!\r\n    Tho' our cloathing is changed, yet we scorn a powder-puff;\r\n    So at you, ye b----s, here's give you Hot Stuff.\"\r\nP/\r\n\r\nOn the repulse at Montmorenci, _Wolfe to Pitt, 2 Sept. 1759.

Niagara\r\n\r\n\r\nPitt had directed that, while Quebec was attacked, an attempt should be\r\nmade to penetrate into Canada by way of Ticonderoga and Crown Point.\r\nThus the two armies might unite in the heart of the colony, or, at\r\nleast, a powerful diversion might be effected in behalf of Wolfe. At the\r\nsame time Oswego was to be re-established, and the possession of Fort\r\nDuquesne, or Pittsburg, secured by reinforcements and supplies; while\r\nAmherst, the commander-in-chief, was further directed to pursue any\r\nother enterprise which in his opinion would weaken the enemy, without\r\ndetriment to the main objects of the campaign.[722] He accordingly\r\nresolved to attempt the capture of Niagara. Brigadier Prideaux was\r\ncharged with this stroke; Brigadier Stanwix was sent to conduct the\r\noperations for the relief of Pittsburg; and Amherst himself prepared to\r\nlead the grand central advance against Ticonderoga, Crown Point, and\r\nMontreal.[723]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 722: _Pitt to Amherst, 23 Jan., 10 March, 1759_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 723: _Amherst to Pitt, 19 June, 1759. Amherst to Stanwix, 6\r\nMay, 1759_.]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of June he reached that valley by the head of Lake\r\nGeorge which for five years past had been the annual mustering-place of\r\narmies. Here were now gathered about eleven thousand men, half regulars\r\nand half provincials,[724] drilling every day, firing by platoons,\r\nfiring at marks, practising manoeuvres in the woods; going out on\r\nscouting parties, bathing parties, fishing parties; gathering wild herbs\r\nto serve for greens, cutting brushwood and meadow hay to make hospital\r\nbeds. The sick were ordered on certain mornings to repair to the\r\nsurgeon's tent, there, in prompt succession, to swallow such doses as he\r\nthought appropriate to their several ailments; and it was further\r\nordered that \"every fair day they that can walk be paraded together and\r\nmarched down to the lake to wash their hands and faces.\" Courts-martial\r\nwere numerous; culprits were flogged at the head of each regiment in\r\nturn, and occasionally one was shot. A frequent employment was the\r\ncutting of spruce tops to make spruce beer. This innocent beverage was\r\nreputed sovereign against scurvy; and such was the fame of its virtues\r\nthat a copious supply of the West Indian molasses used in concocting it\r\nwas thought indispensable to every army or garrison in the wilderness.\r\nThroughout this campaign it is repeatedly mentioned in general orders,\r\nand the soldiers are promised that they shall have as much of it as they\r\nwant at a halfpenny a quart.[725]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 724: Mante, 210.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 725: _Orderly Book of Commissary Wilson in the Expedition\r\nagainst Ticonderoga, 1759. Journal of Samuel Warner, a Massachusetts\r\nSoldier, 1759. General and Regimental Orders, Army of Major-General\r\nAmherst, 1759. Diary of Sergeant Merriman, of Ruggles's Regiment, 1759._\r\nI owe to William L. Stone, Esq., the use of the last two curious\r\ndocuments.]\r\n\r\nThe rear of the-army was well protected from insult. Fortified posts\r\nwere built at intervals of three or four miles along the road to Fort\r\nEdward, and especially at the station called Half-way Brook; while, for\r\nthe whole distance, a broad belt of wood on both sides was cut down and\r\nburned, to deprive a skulking enemy of cover. Amherst was never long in\r\none place without building a fort there. He now began one, which proved\r\nwholly needless, on that flat rocky hill where the English made their\r\nintrenched camp during the siege of Fort William Henry. Only one bastion\r\nof it was ever finished, and this is still shown to tourists under the\r\nname of Fort George.\r\n\r\nThe army embarked on Saturday, the twenty-first of July. The Reverend\r\nBenjamin Pomeroy watched their departure in some concern, and wrote on\r\nMonday to Abigail, his wife: \"I could wish for more appearance of\r\ndependence on God than was observable among them; yet I hope God will\r\ngrant deliverance unto Israel by them.\" There was another military\r\npageant, another long procession of boats and banners, among the\r\nmountains and islands of Lake George. Night found them near the outlet;\r\nand here they lay till morning, tossed unpleasantly on waves ruffled by\r\na summer gale. At daylight they landed, beat back a French detachment,\r\nand marched by the portage road to the saw-mill at the waterfall. There\r\nwas little resistance. They occupied the heights, and then advanced to\r\nthe famous line of intrenchment against which the army of Abercromby had\r\nhurled itself in vain. These works had been completely reconstructed,\r\npartly of earth, and partly of logs. Amherst's followers were less\r\nnumerous than those of his predecessor, while the French commander,\r\nBourlamaque, had a force nearly equal to that of Montcalm in the summer\r\nbefore; yet he made no attempt to defend the intrenchment, and the\r\nEnglish, encamping along its front, found it an excellent shelter from\r\nthe cannon of the fort beyond.\r\n\r\nAmherst brought up his artillery and began approaches in form, when, on\r\nthe night of the twenty-third, it was found that Bourlamaque had retired\r\ndown Lake Champlain, leaving four hundred men under Hebecourt to defend\r\nthe place as long as possible. This was in obedience to an order from\r\nVaudreuil, requiring him on the approach of the English to abandon both\r\nTiconderoga and Crown Point, retreat to the outlet of Lake Champlain,\r\ntake post at Isle-aux-Noix, and there defend himself to the last\r\nextremity;[726] a course unquestionably the best that could have been\r\ntaken, since obstinacy in holding Ticonderoga might have involved the\r\nsurrender of Bourlamaque's whole force, while Isle-aux-Noix offered rare\r\nadvantages for defence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 726: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 8 Nov. 1759. Instructions pour M.\r\nde Bourlamaque, 20 Mai, 1759, signé Vaudreuil. Montcalm à Bourlamaque, 4\r\nJuin, 1759_.]\r\n\r\nThe fort fired briskly; a cannon-shot killed Colonel Townshend, and a\r\nfew soldiers were killed and wounded by grape and bursting shells; when,\r\nat dusk on the evening of the twenty-sixth, an unusual movement was seen\r\namong the garrison, and, about ten o'clock, three deserters came in\r\ngreat excitement to the English camp. They reported that Hebecourt and\r\nhis soldiers were escaping in their boats, and that a match was burning\r\nin the magazine to blow Ticonderoga to atoms. Amherst offered a hundred\r\nguineas to any one of them who would point out the match, that it might\r\nbe cut; but they shrank from the perilous venture. All was silent till\r\neleven o'clock, when a broad, fierce glare burst on the night, and a\r\nroaring explosion shook the promontory; then came a few breathless\r\nmoments, and then the fragments of Fort Ticonderoga fell with clatter\r\nand splash on the water and the land. It was but one bastion, however,\r\nthat had been thus hurled skyward. The rest of the fort was little\r\nhurt, though the barracks and other combustible parts were set on fire,\r\nand by the light the French flag was seen still waving on the\r\nrampart.[727] A sergeant of the light infantry, braving the risk of\r\nother explosions, went and brought it off. Thus did this redoubted\r\nstronghold of France fall at last into English hands, as in all\r\nlikelihood it would have done a year sooner, if Amherst had commanded in\r\nAbercromby's place; for, with the deliberation that marked all his\r\nproceedings, he would have sat down before Montcalm's wooden wall and\r\nknocked it to splinters with his cannon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 727: _Journal of Colonel Amherst_ (brother of General\r\nAmherst). _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 8 Nov. 1759. Amherst to Prideaux, 28\r\nJuly, 1759. Amherst to Pitt, 27 July, 1759_. Mante, 213. Knox, I.,\r\n397-403. _Vaudreuil à Bourlamaque, 19 Juin, 1759_.]\r\n\r\nHe now set about repairing the damaged works and making ready to advance\r\non Crown Point; when on the first of August his scouts told him that the\r\nenemy had abandoned this place also, and retreated northward down the\r\nlake.[728] Well pleased, he took possession of the deserted fort, and,\r\nin the animation of success, thought for a moment of keeping the promise\r\nhe had given to Pitt \"to make an irruption into Canada with the utmost\r\nvigor and despatch.\"[729] Wolfe, his brother in arms and his friend, was\r\nbattling with the impossible under the rocks of Quebec, and every\r\nmotive, public and private, impelled Amherst to push to his relief, not\r\ncounting costs, or balancing risks too nicely. He was ready enough to\r\nspur on others, for he wrote to Gage: \"We must all be alert and active\r\nday and night; if we all do our parts the French must fall;\"[730] but,\r\nfar from doing his, he set the army to building a new fort at Crown\r\nPoint, telling them that it would \"give plenty, peace, and quiet to His\r\nMajesty's subjects for ages to come.\"[731] Then he began three small\r\nadditional forts, as outworks to the first, sent two parties to explore\r\nthe sources of the Hudson; one party to explore Otter Creek; another to\r\nexplore South Bay, which was already well known; another to make a road\r\nacross what is now the State of Vermont, from Crown Point to\r\nCharlestown, or \"Number Four,\" on the Connecticut; and another to widen\r\nand improve the old French road between Crown Point and Ticonderoga. His\r\nindustry was untiring; a great deal of useful work was done: but the\r\nessential task of making a diversion to aid the army of Wolfe was\r\nneedlessly postponed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 728: _Amherst to Pitt, 5 Aug. 1759_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 729: _Ibid., 19 June, 1759_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 730: _Amherst to Gage, 1 Aug. 1759_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 731: _General Orders, 13 Aug. 1759_.]\r\n\r\nIt is true that some delay was inevitable. The French had four armed\r\nvessels on the lake, and this made it necessary to provide an equal or\r\nsuperior force to protect the troops on their way to Isle-aux-Noix.\r\nCaptain Loring, the English naval commander, was therefore ordered to\r\nbuild a brigantine; and, this being thought insufficient, he was\r\ndirected to add a kind of floating battery, moved by sweeps. Three weeks\r\nlater, in consequence of farther information concerning the force of the\r\nFrench vessels, Amherst ordered an armed sloop to be put on the stocks;\r\nand this involved a long delay. The saw-mill at Ticonderoga was to\r\nfurnish planks for the intended navy; but, being overtasked in sawing\r\ntimber for the new works at Crown Point, it was continually breaking\r\ndown. Hence much time was lost, and autumn was well advanced before\r\nLoring could launch his vessels.[732]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 732: _Amherst to Pitt, 22 Oct. 1759_. This letter, which is in\r\nthe form of a journal, covers twenty-one folio pages.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile news had come from Prideaux and the Niagara expedition. That\r\nofficer had been ordered to ascend the Mohawk with five thousand\r\nregulars and provincials, leave a strong garrison at Fort Stanwix, on\r\nthe Great Carrying Place, establish posts at both ends of Lake Oneida,\r\ndescend the Onondaga to Oswego, leave nearly half his force there under\r\nColonel Haldimand, and proceed with the rest to attack Niagara.[733]\r\nThese orders he accomplished. Haldimand remained to reoccupy the spot\r\nthat Montcalm had made desolate three years before; and, while preparing\r\nto build a fort, he barricaded his camp with pork and flour barrels,\r\nlest the enemy should make a dash upon him from their station at the\r\nhead of the St. Lawrence Rapids. Such an attack was probable; for if the\r\nFrench could seize Oswego, the return of Prideaux from Niagara would be\r\ncut off, and when his small stock of provisions had failed, he would be\r\nreduced to extremity. Saint-Luc de la Corne left the head of the Rapids\r\nearly in July with a thousand French and Canadians and a body of\r\nIndians, who soon made their appearance among the stumps and bushes that\r\nsurrounded the camp at Oswego. The priest Piquet was of the party; and\r\nfive deserters declared that he solemnly blessed them, and told them to\r\ngive the English no quarter.[734] Some valuable time was lost in\r\nbestowing the benediction; yet Haldimand's men were taken by surprise.\r\nMany of them were dispersed in the woods, cutting timber for the\r\nintended fort; and it might have gone hard with them had not some of La\r\nCorne's Canadians become alarmed and rushed back to their boats,\r\noversetting Father Piquet on the way.[735] These being rallied, the\r\nwhole party ensconced itself in a tract of felled trees so far from the\r\nEnglish that their fire did little harm. They continued it about two\r\nhours, and resumed it the next morning; when, three cannon being brought\r\nto bear on them, they took to their boats and disappeared, having lost\r\nabout thirty killed and wounded, including two officers and La Corne\r\nhimself, who was shot in the thigh. The English loss was slight.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 733: _Instructions of Amherst to Prideaux, 17 May, 1759.\r\nPrideaux to Haldimand, 30 June, 1759_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 734: _Journal of Colonel Amherst_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 735: Pouchot, II. 130. _Compare Mémoires sur le Canada,\r\n1749-1760_; _N.Y. Col. Docs._, VII. 395; and _Letter from Oswego_, in\r\n_Boston Evening Post_, No. 1,248.]\r\n\r\nPrideaux safely reached Niagara, and laid siege to it. It was a strong\r\nfort, lately rebuilt in regular form by an excellent officer, Captain\r\nPouchot, of the battalion of Béarn, who commanded it. It stood where the\r\npresent fort stands, in the angle formed by the junction of the River\r\nNiagara with Lake Ontario, and was held by about six hundred men, well\r\nsupplied with provisions and munitions of war.[736] Higher up the river,\r\na mile and a half above the cataract, there was another fort, called\r\nLittle Niagara, built of wood, and commanded by the half-breed officer,\r\nJoncaire-Chabert, who with his brother, Joncaire-Clauzonne, and a\r\nnumerous clan of Indian relatives, had so long thwarted the efforts of\r\nJohnson to engage the Five Nations in the English cause. But recent\r\nEnglish successes had had their effect. Joncaire's influence was waning,\r\nand Johnson was now in Prideaux's camp with nine hundred Five Nation\r\nwarriors pledged to fight the French. Joncaire, finding his fort\r\nuntenable, burned it, and came with his garrison and his Indian friends\r\nto reinforce Niagara.[737]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 736: Pouchot says 515, besides 60 men from Little Niagara;\r\nVaudreuil gives a total of 589.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 737: Pouchot, II. 52, 59. _Procès de Bigot, Cadet, et autres,\r\nMémoire pour Daniel de Joncaire-Chabert._]\r\n\r\nPouchot had another resource, on which he confidently relied. In\r\nobedience to an order from Vaudreuil, the French population of the\r\nIllinois, Detroit, and other distant posts, joined with troops of\r\nWestern Indians, had come down the Lakes to recover Pittsburg, undo the\r\nwork of Forbes, and restore French ascendency on the Ohio. Pittsburg had\r\nbeen in imminent danger; nor was it yet safe, though General Stanwix was\r\nsparing no effort to succor it.[738] These mixed bands of white men and\r\nred, bushrangers and savages, were now gathered, partly at Le Boeuf and\r\nVenango, but chiefly at Presquisle, under command of Aubry, Ligneris,\r\nMarin, and other partisan chiefs, the best in Canada. No sooner did\r\nPouchot learn that the English were coming to attack him than he sent a\r\nmessenger to summon them all to his aid.[739]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 738: _Letters of Colonel Hugh Mercer, commanding at Pittsburg,\r\nJanuary-June, 1759. Letters of Stanwix, May-July, 1759. Letter from\r\nPittsburg_, in _Boston News Letter_, No. 3,023. _Narrative of John\r\nOrmsby._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 739: Pouchot, II. 46.]\r\n\r\nThe siege was begun in form, though the English engineers were so\r\nincompetent that the trenches, as first laid out, were scoured by the\r\nfire of the place, and had to be made anew.[740] At last the batteries\r\nopened fire. A shell from a coehorn burst prematurely, just as it left\r\nthe mouth of the piece, and a fragment striking Prideaux on the head,\r\nkilled him instantly. Johnson took command in his place, and made up in\r\nenergy what he lacked in skill. In two or three weeks the fort was in\r\nextremity. The rampart was breached, more than a hundred of the garrison\r\nwere killed or disabled, and the rest were exhausted with want of sleep.\r\nPouchot watched anxiously for the promised succors; and on the morning\r\nof the twenty-fourth of July a distant firing told him that they were at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 740: _Rutherford to Haldimand, 14 July, 1759._ Prideaux was\r\nextremely disgusted. _Prideaux to Haldimand, 13 July, 1759_.

Pouchot, II. 94. A letter from Aubry to Pouchot put\r\nthe whole at 2,500, half of them Indians. _Historical Magazine_, V.,\r\nSecond Series, 199.]\r\n\r\nWhen Pouchot heard the firing, he went with a wounded artillery officer\r\nto the bastion next the river; and as the forest had been cut away for a\r\ngreat distance, they could see more than a mile and a half along the\r\nshore. There, by glimpses among trees and bushes, they descried bodies\r\nof men, now advancing, and now retreating; Indians in rapid movement,\r\nand the smoke of guns, the sound of which reached their ears in heavy\r\nvolleys, or a sharp and angry rattle. Meanwhile the English cannon had\r\nceased their fire, and the silent trenches seemed deserted, as if their\r\noccupants were gone to meet the advancing foe. There was a call in the\r\nfort for volunteers to sally and destroy the works; but no sooner did\r\nthey show themselves along the covered way than the seemingly abandoned\r\ntrenches were thronged with men and bayonets, and the attempt was given\r\nup. The distant firing lasted half an hour, then ceased, and Pouchot\r\nremained in suspense; till, at two in the afternoon, a friendly\r\nOnondaga, who had passed unnoticed through the English lines, came to\r\nhim with the announcement that the French and their allies had been\r\nrouted and cut to pieces. Pouchot would not believe him.\r\n\r\nNevertheless his tale was true. Johnson, besides his Indians, had with\r\nhim about twenty-three hundred men, whom he was forced to divide into\r\nthree separate bodies,--one to guard the bateaux, one to guard the\r\ntrenches, and one to fight Aubry and his band. This last body consisted\r\nof the provincial light infantry and the pickets, two companies of\r\ngrenadiers, and a hundred and fifty men of the forty-sixth regiment, all\r\nunder command of Colonel Massey.[742] They took post behind an abattis\r\nat a place called La Belle Famille, and the Five Nation warriors placed\r\nthemselves on their flanks. These savages had shown signs of\r\ndisaffection; and when the enemy approached, they opened a parley with\r\nthe French Indians, which, however, soon ended, and both sides raised\r\nthe war-whoop. The fight was brisk for a while; but at last Aubry's men\r\nbroke away in a panic. The French officers seem to have made desperate\r\nefforts to retrieve the day, for nearly all of them were killed or\r\ncaptured; while their followers, after heavy loss, fled to their canoes\r\nand boats above the cataract, hastened back to Lake Erie, burned\r\nPresquisle, Le Boeuf, and Venango, and, joined by the garrisons of those\r\nforts, retreated to Detroit, leaving the whole region of the upper Ohio\r\nin undisputed possession of the English.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 742: _Johnson to Amherst, 25 July, 1759._ Knox, II. 135.\r\n_Captain Delancey to----, 25 July, 1759._ This writer commanded the\r\nlight infantry in the fight.]\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock on the day of the battle, after a furious cannonade on\r\nboth sides, a trumpet sounded from the trenches, and an officer\r\napproached the fort with a summons to surrender. He brought also a paper\r\ncontaining the names of the captive French officers, though some of them\r\nwere spelled in a way that defied recognition. Pouchot, feigning\r\nincredulity, sent an officer of his own to the English camp, who soon\r\nsaw unanswerable proof of the disaster; for here, under a shelter of\r\nleaves and boughs near the tent of Johnson, sat Ligneris, severely\r\nwounded, with Aubry, Villiers, Montigny, Marin, and their companions in\r\nmisfortune,--in all, sixteen officers, four cadets, and a surgeon.[743]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 743: Johnson gives the names in his private _Diary_, printed\r\nin Stone, _Life of Johnson_, II. 394. Compare Pouchot, II. 105, 106.\r\n_Letter from Niagara_, in _Boston Evening Post_, No. 1,250. _Vaudreuil\r\nau Ministre, 30 Oct. 1759._]\r\n\r\nPouchot had now no choice but surrender. By the terms of the\r\ncapitulation, the garrison were to be sent prisoners to New York, though\r\nhonors of war were granted them in acknowledgment of their courageous\r\nconduct. There was a special stipulation that they should be protected\r\nfrom the Indians, of whom they stood in the greatest terror, lest the\r\nmassacre of Fort William Henry should be avenged upon them. Johnson\r\nrestrained his dangerous allies, and, though the fort was pillaged, no\r\nblood was shed.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Niagara was an important stroke. Thenceforth Detroit,\r\nMichillimackinac, the Illinois, and all the other French interior posts,\r\nwere severed from Canada, and left in helpless isolation; but Amherst\r\nwas not yet satisfied. On hearing of Prideaux's death he sent Brigadier\r\nGage to supersede Johnson and take command on Lake Ontario, directing\r\nhim to descend the St. Lawrence, attack the French posts at the head of\r\nthe rapids, and hold them if possible for the winter. The attempt was\r\ndifficult; for the French force on the St. Lawrence was now greater than\r\nthat which Gage could bring against it, after providing for the safety\r\nof Oswego and Niagara. Nor was he by nature prone to dashing and\r\ndoubtful enterprise. He reported that the movement was impossible, much\r\nto the disappointment of Amherst, who seemed to expect from subordinates\r\nan activity greater than his own.[744]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 744: _Amherst to Gage, 28 July, 1 Aug., 14 Aug., 11 Sept.\r\n1759. Diary of Sir William Johnson_, in Stone, _Life of Johnson_, II.\r\n394-429.]\r\n\r\nHe, meanwhile, was working at his fort at Crown Point, while the season\r\ncrept away, and Bourlamaque lay ready to receive him at Isle-aux-Noix.\r\n\"I wait his coming with impatience,\" writes the French commander,\r\n\"though I doubt if he will venture to attack a post where we are\r\nintrenched to the teeth, and armed with a hundred pieces of\r\ncannon.\"[745] Bourlamaque now had with him thirty-five hundred men, in a\r\nposition of great strength. Isle-aux-Noix, planted in mid-channel of the\r\nRichelieu soon after it issues from Lake Champlain, had been diligently\r\nfortified since the spring. On each side of it was an arm of the river,\r\nclosed against an enemy with _chevaux-de-frise_. To attack it in front\r\nin the face of its formidable artillery would be a hazardous attempt,\r\nand the task of reducing it was likely to be a long one. The French\r\nforce in these parts had lately received accessions. After the fall of\r\nNiagara the danger seemed so great, both in the direction of Lake\r\nOntario and that of Lake Champlain, that Lévis had been sent up from\r\nQuebec with eight hundred men to command the whole department of\r\nMontreal.[746] A body of troops and militia was encamped opposite that\r\ntown, ready to march towards either quarter, as need might be, while\r\nthe abundant crops of the neighboring parishes were harvested by armed\r\nbands, ready at a word to drop the sickle for the gun.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 745: _Bourlamaque à_ (_Bernetz?_), _22 Sept. 1759._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 746: _Montcalm à Bourlamaque, 9 Août, 1759. Rigaud à\r\nBourlamaque, 14 Août, 1759. Lévis à Bourlamaque, 25 Août, 1759._]\r\n\r\nThus the promised advance of Amherst into Canada would be not without\r\nits difficulties, even when his navy, too tardily begun, should be ready\r\nto act its part. But if he showed no haste in succoring Wolfe, he at\r\nleast made some attempts to communicate with him. Early in August he\r\nwrote him a letter, which Ensign Hutchins, of the rangers, carried to\r\nhim in about a month by the long and circuitous route of the Kennebec,\r\nand which, after telling the news of the campaign, ended thus: \"You may\r\ndepend on my doing all I can for effectually reducing Canada. Now is the\r\ntime!\"[747] Amherst soon after tried another expedient, and sent\r\nCaptains Kennedy and Hamilton with a flag of truce and a message of\r\npeace to the Abenakis of St. Francis, who, he thought, won over by these\r\nadvances, might permit the two officers to pass unmolested to Quebec.\r\nBut the Abenakis seized them and carried them prisoners to Montreal; on\r\nwhich Amherst sent Major Robert Rogers and a band of rangers to destroy\r\ntheir town.[748]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 747: _Amherst to Wolfe, 7 Aug. 1759._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 748: _Amherst to Pitt, 22 Oct. 1759._ Rogers, _Journals_,\r\n144.]\r\n\r\nIt was the eleventh of October before the miniature navy of Captain\r\nLoring--the floating battery, the brig, and the sloop that had been\r\nbegun three weeks too late--was ready for service. They sailed at once\r\nto look for the enemy. The four French vessels made no resistance. One\r\nof them succeeded in reaching Isle-aux-Noix; one was run aground; and\r\ntwo were sunk by their crews, who escaped to the shore. Amherst,\r\nmeanwhile, leaving the provincials to work at the fort, embarked with\r\nthe regulars in bateaux, and proceeded on his northern way till, on the\r\nevening of the twelfth, a head-wind began to blow, and, rising to a\r\nstorm, drove him for shelter into Ligonier Bay, on the west side of the\r\nlake.[749] On the thirteenth, it blew a gale. The lake raged like an\r\nangry sea, and the frail bateaux, fit only for smooth water, could not\r\nhave lived a moment. Through all the next night the gale continued, with\r\nfloods of driving rain. \"I hope it will soon change,\" wrote Amherst on\r\nthe fifteenth, \"for I have no time to lose.\" He was right. He had waited\r\ntill the season of autumnal storms, when nature was more dangerous than\r\nman. On the sixteenth there was frost, and the wind did not abate. On\r\nthe next morning it shifted to the south, but soon turned back with\r\nviolence to the north, and the ruffled lake put on a look of winter,\r\n\"which determined me,\" says the General, \"not to lose time by striving\r\nto get to the Isle-aux-Noix, where I should arrive too late to force the\r\nenemy from their post, but to return to Crown Point and complete the\r\nworks there.\" This he did, and spent the remnant of the season in the\r\ncongenial task of finishing the fort, of which the massive remains still\r\nbear witness to his industry.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 749: _Orderly Book of Commissary Wilson_.]\r\n\r\nWhen Lévis heard that the English army had fallen back, he wrote, well\r\npleased, to Bourlamaque: \"I don't know how General Amherst will excuse\r\nhimself to his Court, but I am very glad he let us alone, because the\r\nCanadians are so backward that you could count on nobody but the\r\nregulars.\"[750]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 750: _Lévis à Bourlamaque, 1 Nov. 1759._]\r\n\r\nConcerning this year's operations on the Lakes, it may be observed that\r\nthe result was not what the French feared, or what the British colonists\r\nhad cause to hope. If, at the end of winter, Amherst had begun, as he\r\nmight have done, the building of armed vessels at the head of the\r\nnavigable waters of Lake Champlain, where Whitehall now stands, he would\r\nhave had a navy ready to his hand before August, and would have been\r\nable to follow the retreating French without delay, and attack them at\r\nIsle-aux-Noix before they had finished their fortifications. And if, at\r\nthe same time, he had directed Prideaux, instead of attacking Niagara,\r\nto co-operate with him by descending the St. Lawrence towards Montreal,\r\nthe prospect was good that the two armies would have united at the\r\nplace, and ended the campaign by the reduction of all Canada. In this\r\ncase Niagara and all the western posts would have fallen without a blow.\r\n\r\nMajor Robert Rogers, sent in September to punish the Abenakis of St.\r\nFrancis, had addressed himself to the task with his usual vigor. These\r\nIndians had been settled for about three quarters of a century on the\r\nRiver St. Francis, a few miles above its junction with the St. Lawrence.\r\nThey were nominal Christians, and had been under the control of their\r\nmissionaries for three generations; but though zealous and sometimes\r\nfanatical in their devotion to the forms of Romanism, they remained\r\nthorough savages in dress, habits, and character. They were the scourge\r\nof the New England borders, where they surprised and burned farmhouses\r\nand small hamlets, killed men, women, and children without distinction,\r\ncarried others prisoners to their village, subjected them to the torture\r\nof \"running the gantlet,\" and compelled them to witness dances of\r\ntriumph around the scalps of parents, children, and friends.\r\n\r\nAmherst's instructions to Rogers contained the following: \"Remember the\r\nbarbarities that have been committed by the enemy's Indian scoundrels.\r\nTake your revenge, but don't forget that, though those dastardly\r\nvillains have promiscuously murdered women and children of all ages, it\r\nis my order that no women or children be killed or hurt.\"\r\n\r\nRogers and his men set out in whaleboats, and, eluding the French armed\r\nvessels, then in full activity, came, on the tenth day, to Missisquoi\r\nBay, at the north end of Lake Champlain. Here he hid his boats, leaving\r\ntwo friendly Indians to watch them from a distance, and inform him\r\nshould the enemy discover them. He then began his march for St. Francis,\r\nwhen, on the evening of the second day, the two Indians overtook him\r\nwith the startling news that a party of about four hundred French had\r\nfound the boats, and that half of them were on his tracks in hot\r\npursuit. It was certain that the alarm would soon be given, and other\r\nparties sent to cut him off. He took the bold resolution of outmarching\r\nhis pursuers, pushing straight for St. Francis, striking it before\r\nsuccors could arrive, and then returning by Lake Memphremagog and the\r\nConnecticut. Accordingly he despatched Lieutenant McMullen by a\r\ncircuitous route back to Crown Point, with a request to Amherst that\r\nprovisions should be sent up the Connecticut to meet him on the way\r\ndown. Then he set his course for the Indian town, and for nine days more\r\ntoiled through the forest with desperate energy. Much of the way was\r\nthrough dense spruce swamps, with no dry resting-place at night. At\r\nlength the party reached the River St. Francis, fifteen miles above the\r\ntown, and, hooking their arms together for mutual support, forded it\r\nwith extreme difficulty. Towards evening, Rogers climbed a tree, and\r\ndescried the town three miles distant. Accidents, fatigue, and illness\r\nhad reduced his followers to a hundred and forty-two officers and men.\r\nHe left them to rest for a time, and, taking with him Lieutenant Turner\r\nand Ensign Avery, went to reconnoitre the place; left his two\r\ncompanions, entered it disguised in an Indian dress, and saw the\r\nunconscious savages yelling and signing in the full enjoyment of a grand\r\ndance. At two o'clock in the morning he rejoined his party, and at three\r\nled them to the attack, formed them in a semicircle, and burst in upon\r\nthe town half an hour before sunrise. Many of the warriors were absent,\r\nand the rest were asleep. Some were killed in their beds, and some shot\r\ndown in trying to escape. \"About seven o'clock in the morning,\" he says,\r\n\"the affair was completely over, in which time we had killed at least\r\ntwo hundred Indians and taken twenty of their women and children\r\nprisoners, fifteen of whom I let go their own way, and five I brought\r\nwith me, namely, two Indian boys and three Indian girls. I likewise\r\nretook five English captives.\"\r\n\r\nEnglish scalps in hundreds were dangling from poles over the doors of\r\nthe houses.[751] The town was pillaged and burned, not excepting the\r\nchurch, where ornaments of some value were found. On the side of the\r\nrangers, Captain Ogden and six men were wounded, and a Mohegan Indian\r\nfrom Stockbridge was killed. Rogers was told by his prisoners that a\r\nparty of three hundred French and Indians was encamped on the river\r\nbelow, and that another party of two hundred and fifteen was not far\r\ndistant. They had been sent to cut off the retreat of the invaders, but\r\nwere doubtful as to their designs till after the blow was struck. There\r\nwas no time to lose. The rangers made all haste southward, up the St.\r\nFrancis, subsisting on corn from the Indian town; till, near the eastern\r\nborders of Lake Memphremagog, the supply failed, and they separated into\r\nsmall parties, the better to sustain life by hunting. The enemy followed\r\nclose, attacked Ensign Avery's party, and captured five of them; then\r\nfell upon a band of about twenty, under Lieutenants Dunbar and Turner,\r\nand killed or captured nearly all. The other bands eluded their\r\npursuers, turned southeastward, reached the Connecticut, some here, some\r\nthere, and, giddy with fatigue and hunger, toiled wearily down the wild\r\nand lonely stream to the appointed rendezvous at the mouth of the\r\nAmonoosuc.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 751: Rogers says \"about six hundred.\" Other accounts say six\r\nor seven hundred. The late Abbé Maurault, missionary of the St. Francis\r\nIndians, and their historian, adopts the latter statement, though it is\r\nprobably exaggerated.]\r\n\r\nThis was the place to which Rogers had requested that provisions might\r\nbe sent; and the hope of finding them there had been the breath of life\r\nto the famished wayfarers. To their horror, the place was a solitude.\r\nThere were fires still burning, but those who made them were gone.\r\nAmherst had sent Lieutenant Stephen up the river from Charlestown with\r\nan abundant supply of food; but finding nobody at the Amonoosuc, he had\r\nwaited there two days, and then returned, carrying the provisions back\r\nwith him; for which outrageous conduct he was expelled from the service.\r\n\"It is hardly possible,\" says Rogers, \"to describe our grief and\r\nconsternation.\" Some gave themselves up to despair. Few but their\r\nindomitable chief had strength to go father. There was scarcely any\r\ngame, and the barren wilderness yielded no sustenance but a few lily\r\nbulbs and the tubers of the climbing plant called in New England the\r\nground-nut. Leaving his party to these miserable resources, and\r\npromising to send then relief within ten days, Rogers made a raft of dry\r\npine logs, and drifted on it down the stream, with Captain Ogden, a\r\nranger, and one of the captive Indian boys. They were stopped on the\r\nsecond day by rapids, and gained the shore with difficulty. At the foot\r\nof the rapids, while Ogden and the ranger went in search of squirrels,\r\nRogers set himself to making another raft; and having no strength to use\r\nthe axe, he burned down the trees, which he then divided into logs by\r\nthe same process. Five days after leaving his party he reached the first\r\nEnglish settlement, Charlestown, or \"Number Four,\" and immediately sent\r\na canoe with provisions to the relief of the sufferers, following\r\nhimself with other canoes two days later. Most of the men were saved,\r\nthough some died miserably of famine and exhaustion. Of the few who had\r\nbeen captured, we are told by French contemporary that they \"became\r\nvictims of the fury of the Indian women,\" from whose clutches the\r\nCanadians tried in vain to save them.[752]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 752: _Événements de la Guerre en Canada,_ 1759, 1760. Compare\r\n_N.Y. Col. Docs.,_ X. 1042.]\r\n\r\nNOTE: On the day after he reached \"Number Four,\" Rogers wrote a report\r\nof his expedition to Amherst. This letter is printed in his _Journals_,\r\nin which he gives also a supplementary account, containing further\r\nparticulars. The _New Hampshire Gazette, Boston Evening Post,_ and other\r\nnewspapers of the time recount the story in detail. Hoyt (_Indian Wars,_\r\n302) repeats it, with a few additions drawn from the recollections of\r\nsurvivors, long after. There is another account, very short and\r\nunsatisfactory, by Thompson Maxwell, who says that he was of the party,\r\nwhich is doubtful. Mante (223) gives horrible details of the sufferings\r\nof the rangers. An old chief of the St. Francis Indians, said to be one\r\nof those who pursued Rogers after the town was burned, many years ago\r\ntold Mr. Jesse Pennoyer, a government land surveyor, that Rogers laid an\r\nambush for the pursuers, and defeated them with great loss. This, the\r\nstory says, took place near the present town of Sherbrooke; and minute\r\ndetails are given, with high praise of the skill and conduct of the\r\nfamous partisan. If such an incident really took place, it is scarcely\r\npossible that Rogers would not have made some mention of it. On the\r\nother hand, it is equally incredible that the Indians would have\r\ninvented the tale of their own defeat. I am indebted for Pennoyer's\r\npuzzling narrative to the kindness of R.A. Ramsay, Esq., of Montreal. It\r\nwas printed, in 1869, in the _History of the Eastern Townships,_ by\r\nMrs. C.M. Day. All things considered, it is probably groundless.\r\n\r\nVaudreuil describes the destruction of the village in a letter to the\r\nMinister dated October 26, and says that Rogers had a hundred and fifty\r\nmen; that St. Francis was burned to ashes; that the head chief and\r\nothers were killed; that he (Vaudreuil), hearing of the march of the\r\nrangers, sent the most active of the Canadians to oppose them, and that\r\nLongueuil sent all the Canadians and Indians he could muster to pursue\r\nthem on their retreat; that forty-six rangers were killed, and ten\r\ncaptured; that he thinks all the rest will starve to death; and,\r\nfinally, that the affair is very unfortunate.\r\n\r\nI once, when a college student, followed on foot the route of Rogers\r\nfrom Lake Memphremagog to the Connecticut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 27\r\n\r\n1759\r\n\r\nThe Heights of Abraham\r\n\r\n\r\nWolfe was deeply moved by the disaster at the heights of Montmorenci,\r\nand in a General Order on the next day he rebuked the grenadiers for\r\ntheir precipitation. \"Such impetuous, irregular, and unsoldierlike\r\nproceedings destroy all order, make it impossible for the commanders to\r\nform any disposition for an attack, and put it out of the general's\r\npower to execute his plans. The grenadiers could not suppose that they\r\ncould beat the French alone.\"\r\n\r\nThe French were elated by their success. \"Everybody,\" says the\r\ncommissary Berniers, \"thought that the campaign was as good as ended,\r\ngloriously for us.\" They had been sufficiently confident even before\r\ntheir victory; and the bearer of a flag of truce told the English\r\nofficers that he had never imagined they were such fools as to attack\r\nQuebec with so small a force. Wolfe, on the other hand, had every reason\r\nto despond. At the outset, before he had seen Quebec and learned the\r\nnature of the ground, he had meant to begin the campaign by taking post\r\non the Plains of Abraham, and thence laying siege to the town; but he\r\nsoon discovered that the Plains of Abraham were hardly more within his\r\nreach than was Quebec itself. Such hope as was left him lay in the\r\ncomposition of Montcalm's army. He respected the French commander, and\r\nthought his disciplined soldiers not unworthy of the British steel; but\r\nhe held his militia in high scorn, and could he but face them in the\r\nopen field, he never doubted the result. But Montcalm also distrusted\r\nthem, and persisted in refusing the coveted battle.\r\n\r\nWolfe, therefore, was forced to the conviction that his chances were of\r\nthe smallest. It is said that, despairing of any decisive stroke, he\r\nconceived the idea of fortifying Isle-aux-Coudres, and leaving a part of\r\nhis troops there when he sailed for home, against another attempt in the\r\nspring. The more to weaken the enemy and prepare his future conquest, he\r\nbegan at the same time a course of action which for his credit one would\r\ngladly wipe from the record; for, though far from inhuman, he threw\r\nhimself with extraordinary intensity into whatever work he had in hand,\r\nand, to accomplish it, spared others scarcely more than he spared\r\nhimself. About the middle of August he issued a third proclamation to\r\nthe Canadians, declaring that as they had refused his offers of\r\nprotection and \"had made such ungrateful returns in practising the most\r\nunchristian barbarities against his troops on all occasions, he could no\r\nlonger refrain in justice to himself and his army from chastising them\r\nas they deserved.\" The barbarities in question consisted in the frequent\r\nscalping and mutilating of sentinels and men on outpost duty,\r\nperpetrated no less by Canadians than by Indians. Wolfe's object was\r\ntwofold: first, to cause the militia to desert, and, secondly, to\r\nexhaust the colony. Rangers, light infantry, and Highlanders were sent\r\nto waste the settlements far and wide. Wherever resistance was offered,\r\nfarmhouses and villages were laid in ashes, though churches were\r\ngenerally spared. St. Paul, far below Quebec, was sacked and burned, and\r\nthe settlements of the opposite shore were partially destroyed. The\r\nparishes of L'Ange Gardien, Château Richer, and St. Joachim were wasted\r\nwith fire and sword. Night after night the garrison of Quebec could see\r\nthe light of burning houses as far down as the mountain of Cape\r\nTourmente. Near St. Joachim there was a severe skirmish, followed by\r\natrocious cruelties. Captain Alexander Montgomery, of the forty-third\r\nregiment, who commanded the detachment, and who has been most unjustly\r\nconfounded with the revolutionary general, Richard Montgomery, ordered\r\nthe prisoners to be shot in cold blood, to the indignation of his own\r\nofficers.[753] Robineau de Portneuf, curé of St. Joachim, placed himself\r\nat the head of thirty parishioners and took possession of a large stone\r\nhouse in the adjacent parish of Château Richer, where for a time he held\r\nthe English at bay. At length he and his followers were drawn out into\r\nambush, where they were surrounded and killed; and, being disguised as\r\nIndians, the rangers scalped them all.[754]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 753: Fraser _Journal_. Fraser was an officer under Montgomery,\r\nof whom he speaks with anger and disgust.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 754: Knox, II. 32. Most of the contemporary journals mention\r\nthe incident.]\r\n\r\nMost of the French writers of the time mention these barbarities without\r\nmuch comment, while Vaudreuil loudly denounces them. Yet he himself was\r\nanswerable for atrocities incomparably worse, and on a far larger scale.\r\nHe had turned loose his savages, red and white, along a frontier of six\r\nhundred miles, to waste, burn, and murder at will. \"Women and children,\"\r\nsuch were the orders of Wolfe, \"are to be treated with humanity; if any\r\nviolence is offered to a woman, the offender shall be punished with\r\ndeath.\" These orders were generally obeyed. The English, with the single\r\nexception of Montgomery, killed none but armed men in the act of\r\nresistance or attack; Vaudreuil's war-parties spared neither age nor\r\nsex.\r\n\r\nMontcalm let the parishes burn, and still lay fast intrenched in his\r\nlines of Beauport. He would not imperil all Canada to save a few hundred\r\nfarmhouses; and Wolfe was as far as ever from the battle that he\r\ncoveted. Hitherto, his attacks had been made chiefly below the town;\r\nbut, these having failed, he now changed his plan and renewed on a\r\nlarger scale the movements begun above it in July. With every fair wind,\r\nships and transports passed the batteries of Quebec, favored by a hot\r\nfire from Point Levi, and generally succeeded, with more or less damage,\r\nin gaining the upper river. A fleet of flatboats was also sent thither,\r\nand twelve hundred troops marched overland to embark in them, under\r\nBrigadier Murray. Admiral Holmes took command of the little fleet now\r\ngathered above the town, and operations in that quarter were\r\nsystematically resumed.\r\n\r\nTo oppose them, Bougainville was sent from the camp at Beauport with\r\nfifteen hundred men. His was a most arduous and exhausting duty. He must\r\nwatch the shores for fifteen or twenty miles, divide his force into\r\ndetachments, and subject himself and his followers to the strain of\r\nincessant vigilance and incessant marching. Murray made a descent at\r\nPointe-aux-Trembles, and was repulsed with loss. He tried a second time\r\nat another place, was met before landing by a body of ambushed\r\nCanadians, and was again driven back, his foremost boats full of dead\r\nand wounded. A third time he succeeded, landed at Deschambault, and\r\nburned a large building filled with stores and all the spare baggage of\r\nthe French regular officers. The blow was so alarming that Montcalm\r\nhastened from Beauport to take command in person; but when he arrived\r\nthe English were gone.\r\n\r\nVaudreuil now saw his mistake in sending the French frigates up the\r\nriver out of harm's way, and withdrawing their crews to serve the\r\nbatteries of Quebec. Had these ships been there, they might have\r\noverpowered those of the English in detail as they passed the town. An\r\nattempt was made to retrieve the blunder. The sailors were sent to man\r\nthe frigates anew and attack the squadron of Holmes. It was too late.\r\nHolmes was already too strong for them, and they were recalled. Yet the\r\ndifficulties of the English still seemed insurmountable. Dysentery and\r\nfever broke out in their camps, the number of their effective men was\r\ngreatly reduced, and the advancing season told them that their work must\r\nbe done quickly, or not done at all.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, the distress of the French grew greater every day.\r\nTheir army was on short rations. The operations of the English above the\r\ntown filled the camp of Beauport with dismay, for troops and Canadians\r\nalike dreaded the cutting off of their supplies. These were all drawn\r\nfrom the districts of Three Rivers and Montreal; and, at best, they were\r\nin great danger, since when brought down in boats at night they were apt\r\nto be intercepted, while the difficulty of bringing them by land was\r\nextreme, through scarcity of cattle and horses. Discipline was relaxed,\r\ndisorder and pillage were rife, and the Canadians deserted so fast, that\r\ntowards the end of August two hundred of them, it is said, would\r\nsometimes go off in one night. Early in the month the disheartening news\r\ncame of the loss of Ticonderoga and Crown Point, the retreat of\r\nBourlamaque, the fall of Niagara, and the expected advance of Amherst\r\non Montreal. It was then that Levis was despatched to the scene of\r\ndanger; and Quebec was deplorably weakened by his absence. About this\r\ntime the Lower Town was again set on fire by the English batteries, and\r\na hundred and sixty-seven houses were burned in a night. In the front of\r\nthe Upper Town nearly every building was a ruin. At the General\r\nHospital, which was remote enough to be safe from the bombardment, every\r\nbarn, shed, and garret, and even the chapel itself, were crowded with\r\nsick and wounded, with women and children from the town, and the nuns of\r\nthe Ursulines and the Hôtel-Dieu, driven thither for refuge. Bishop\r\nPontbriand, though suffering from a mortal disease, came almost daily to\r\nvisit and console them from his lodging in the house of the curé at\r\nCharlesbourg.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of August the sky brightened again. It became known that\r\nAmherst was not moving on Montreal, and Bourlamaque wrote that his\r\nposition at Isle-aux-Noix was impregnable. On the twenty-seventh a\r\ndeserter from Wolfe's army brought the welcome assurance that the\r\ninvaders despaired of success, and would soon sail for home; while there\r\nwere movements in the English camps and fleet that seemed to confirm\r\nwhat he said. Vaudreuil breathed more freely, and renewed hope and\r\nconfidence visited the army of Beauport.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a deep cloud fell on the English. Since the siege began, Wolfe\r\nhad passed with ceaseless energy from camp to camp, animating the\r\ntroops, observing everything, and directing everything; but now the pale\r\nface and tall lean form were seen no more, and the rumor spread that the\r\nGeneral was dangerously ill. He had in fact been seized by an access of\r\nthe disease that had tortured him for some time past; and fever had\r\nfollowed. His quarters were at a French farmhouse in the camp at\r\nMontmorenci; and here, as he lay in an upper chamber, helpless in bed,\r\nhis singular and most unmilitary features haggard with disease and drawn\r\nwith pain, no man could less have looked the hero. But as the needle,\r\nthough quivering, points always to the pole, so, through torment and\r\nlanguor and the heats of fever, the mind of Wolfe dwelt on the capture\r\nof Quebec. His illness, which began before the twentieth of August, had\r\nso far subsided on the twenty-fifth that Knox wrote in his Diary of that\r\nday: \"His Excellency General Wolfe is on the recovery, to the\r\ninconceivable joy of the whole army.\" On the twenty-ninth he was able\r\nto write or dictate a letter to the three brigadiers, Monckton,\r\nTownshend, and Murray: \"That the public service may not suffer by the\r\nGeneral's indisposition, he begs the brigadiers will meet and consult\r\ntogether for the public utility and advantage, and consider of the best\r\nmethod to attack the enemy.\" The letter then proposes three plans, all\r\nbold to audacity. The first was to send a part of the army to ford the\r\nMontmorenci eight or nine miles above its mouth, march through the\r\nforest, and fall on the rear of the French at Beauport, while the rest\r\nlanded and attacked them in front. The second was to cross the ford at\r\nthe mouth of the Montmorenci and march along the strand, under the\r\nFrench intrenchments, till a place could be found where the troops might\r\nclimb the heights. The third was to make a general attack from boats at\r\nthe Beauport flats. Wolfe had before entertained two other plans, one of\r\nwhich was to scale the heights at St. Michel, about a league above\r\nQuebec; but this he had abandoned on learning that the French were there\r\nin force to receive him. The other was to storm the Lower Town; but this\r\nalso he had abandoned, because the Upper Town, which commanded it, would\r\nstill remain inaccessible.\r\n\r\nThe brigadiers met in consultation, rejected the three plans proposed in\r\nthe letter, and advised that an attempt should be made to gain a footing\r\non the north shore above the town, place the army between Montcalm and\r\nhis base of supply, and so force him to fight or surrender. The scheme\r\nwas similar to that of the heights of St. Michel. It seemed desperate,\r\nbut so did all the rest; and if by chance it should succeed, the gain\r\nwas far greater than could follow any success below the town. Wolfe\r\nembraced it at once.\r\n\r\nNot that he saw much hope in it. He knew that every chance was against\r\nhim. Disappointment in the past and doom in the future, the pain and\r\nexhaustion of disease, toils, and anxieties \"too great,\" in the words of\r\nBurke, \"to be supported by a delicate constitution, and a body unequal\r\nto the vigorous and enterprising soul that it lodged,\" threw him at\r\ntimes into deep dejection. By those intimate with him he was heard to\r\nsay that he would not go back defeated, \"to be exposed to the censure\r\nand reproach of an ignorant populice.\" In other moods he felt that he\r\nought not to sacrifice what was left of his diminished army in vain\r\nconflict with hopeless obstacles. But his final resolve once taken, he\r\nwould not swerve from it. His fear was that he might not be able to\r\nlead his troops in person. \"I know perfectly well you cannot cure me,\"\r\nhe said to his physician; \"but pray make me so that I may be without\r\npain for a few days, and able to do my duty: that is all I want.\"\r\n\r\nIn a despatch which Wolfe had written to Pitt, Admiral Saunders\r\nconceived that he had ascribed to the fleet more than its just share in\r\nthe disaster at Montmorenci; and he sent him a letter on the subject.\r\nMajor Barré kept it from the invalid till the fever had abated. Wolfe\r\nthen wrote a long answer, which reveals his mixed dejection and resolve.\r\nHe owns the justice of what Saunders had said, but adds: \"I cannot leave\r\nout that part of my letter to Mr. Pitt which you object to. I am\r\nsensible of my own errors in the course of the campaign, see clearly\r\nwherein I have been deficient, and think a little more or less blame to\r\na man that must necessarily be ruined, of little or no consequences. I\r\ntake the blame of that unlucky day entirely upon my own shoulders, and I\r\nexpect to suffer for it.\" Then, speaking of the new project of an attack\r\nabove Quebec, he says despondingly: \"My ill state of health prevents me\r\nfrom executing my own plan; it is of too desperate a nature to order\r\nothers to execute.\" He proceeds, however, to give directions for it. \"It\r\nwill be necessary to run as many small craft as possible above the town,\r\nwith provisions for six weeks, for about five thousand, which is all I\r\nintend to take. My letters, I hope, will be ready to-morrow, and I hope\r\nI shall have strength to lead these men to wherever we can find the\r\nenemy.\"\r\n\r\nOn the next day, the last of August, he was able for the first time to\r\nleave the house. It was on this same day that he wrote his last letter\r\nto his mother: \"My writing to you will convince you that no personal\r\nevils worse than defeats and disappointments have fallen upon me. The\r\nenemy puts nothing to risk, and I can't in conscience put the whole army\r\nto risk. My antagonist has wisely shut himself up in inaccessible\r\nintrenchments, so that I can't get at him without spilling a torrent of\r\nblood, and that perhaps to little purpose. The Marquis de Montcalm is at\r\nthe head of a great number of bad soldiers, and I am at the head of a\r\nsmall number of good ones, that wish for nothing so much as to fight\r\nhim; but the wary old fellow avoids an action, doubtful of the behavior\r\nof his army. People must be of the profession to understand the\r\ndisadvantages and difficulties we labor under, arising from the uncommon\r\nnatural strength of the country.\"\r\n\r\nOn the second of September a vessel was sent to England with his last\r\ndespatch to Pitt. It begins thus: \"The obstacles we have met with in the\r\noperations of the campaign are much greater than we had reason to expect\r\nor could foresee; not so much from the number of the enemy (though\r\nsuperior to us) as from the natural strength of the country, which the\r\nMarquis of Montcalm seems wisely to depend upon. When I learned that\r\nsuccors of all kinds had been thrown into Quebec; that five battalions\r\nof regular troops, completed from the best inhabitants of the country,\r\nsome of the troops of the colony, and every Canadian that was able to\r\nbear arms, besides several nations of savages, had taken the field in a\r\nvery advantageous situation,--I could not flatter myself that I should\r\nbe able to reduce the place. I sought, however, an occasion to attack\r\ntheir army, knowing well that with these troops I was able to fight, and\r\nhoping that a victory might disperse them.\" Then, after recounting the\r\nevents of the campaign with admirable clearness, he continues: \"I found\r\nmyself so ill, and am still so weak, that I begged the general officers\r\nto consult together for the general utility. They are all of opinion\r\nthat, as more ships and provisions are now got above the town, they\r\nshould try, by conveying up a corps of four or five thousand men (which\r\nis nearly the whole strength of the army after the Points of Levi and\r\nOrleans are left in a proper state of defence), to draw the enemy from\r\ntheir present situation and bring them to an action. I have acquiesced\r\nin the proposal, and we are preparing to put it into execution.\" The\r\nletter ends thus: \"By the list of disabled officers, many of whom are of\r\nrank, you may perceive that the army is much weakened. By the nature of\r\nthe river, the most formidable part of this armament is deprived of the\r\npower of acting; yet we have almost the whole force of Canada to oppose.\r\nIn this situation there is such a choice of difficulties that I own\r\nmyself at a loss how to determine. The affairs of Great Britain, I know,\r\nrequire the most vigorous measures; but the courage of a handful of\r\nbrave troops should be exerted only when there is some hope of a\r\nfavorable event; however, you may be assured that the small part of the\r\ncampaign which remains shall be employed, as far as I am able, for the\r\nhonor of His Majesty and the interest of the nation, in which I am sure\r\nof being well seconded by the Admiral and by the generals; happy if our\r\nefforts here can contribute to the success of His Majesty's arms in any\r\nother parts of America.\"\r\n\r\nSome days later, he wrote to the Earl of Holdernesse: \"The Marquis of\r\nMontcalm has a numerous body of armed men (I cannot call it an army),\r\nand the strongest country perhaps in the world. Our fleet blocks up the\r\nriver above and below the town, but can give no manner of aid in an\r\nattack upon the Canadian army. We are now here [_off Cap-Rouge_] with\r\nabout thirty-six hundred men, waiting to attack them when and wherever\r\nthey can best be got at. I am so far recovered as to do business; but my\r\nconstitution is entirely ruined, without the consolation of doing any\r\nconsiderable service to the state, and without any prospect of it.\" He\r\nhad just learned, through the letter brought from Amherst by Ensign\r\nHutchins, that he could expect no help from that quarter.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was as near despair as his undaunted nature was capable of\r\nbeing. In his present state of body and mind he was a hero without the\r\nlight and cheer of heroism. He flattered himself with no illusions, but\r\nsaw the worst and faced it all. He seems to have been entirely without\r\nexcitement. The languor of disease, the desperation of the chances, and\r\nthe greatness of the stake may have wrought to tranquillize him. His\r\nenergy was doubly tasked: to bear up his own sinking frame, and to\r\nachieve an almost hopeless feat of arms.\r\n\r\nAudacious as it was, his plan cannot be called rash if we may accept the\r\nstatement of two well-informed writers on the French side. They say that\r\non the tenth of September the English naval commanders held a council on\r\nboard the flagship, in which it was resolved that the lateness of the\r\nseason required the fleet to leave Quebec without delay. They say\r\nfurther that Wolfe then went to the Admiral, told him that he had found\r\na place where the heights could be scaled, that he would send up a\r\nhundred and fifty picked men to feel the way, and that if they gained a\r\nlodgment at the top, the other troops should follow; if, on the other\r\nhand, the French were there in force to oppose them, he would not\r\nsacrifice the army in a hopeless attempt, but embark them for home,\r\nconsoled by the thought that all had been done that man could do. On\r\nthis, concludes the story, the Admiral and his officers consented to\r\nwait the result.[755]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 755: This statement is made by the Chevalier Johnstone, and,\r\nwith some variation, by the author of the valuable _Journal tenu à\r\nl'Armée que commandoit feu M. le Marquis de Montcalm._ Bigot says that,\r\nafter the battle, he was told by British officers that Wolfe meant to\r\nrisk only an advance party of two hundred men, and to reimbark if they\r\nwere repulsed.]\r\n\r\nAs Wolfe had informed Pitt, his army was greatly weakened. Since the end\r\nof June his loss in killed and wounded was more than eight hundred and\r\nfifty, including two colonels, two majors, nineteen captains, and\r\nthirty-four subalterns; and to these were to be added a greater number\r\ndisabled by disease.\r\n\r\nThe squadron of Admiral Holmes above Quebec had now increased to\r\ntwenty-two vessels, great and small. One of the last that went up was a\r\ndiminutive schooner, armed with a new swivels, and jocosely named the\r\n\"Terror of France.\" She sailed by the town in broad daylight, the\r\nFrench, incensed at her impudence, blazing at her from all their\r\nbatteries; but she passed unharmed, anchored by the Admiral's ship, and\r\nsaluted him triumphantly with her swivels.\r\n\r\nWolfe's first move towards executing his plan was the critical one of\r\nevacuating the camp at Montmorenci. This was accomplished on the third\r\nof September. Montcalm sent a strong force to fall on the rear of the\r\nretiring English. Monckton saw the movement from Point Levi, embarked\r\ntwo battalions in the boats of the fleet, and made a feint of landing at\r\nBeauport. Montcalm recalled his troops to repulse the threatened attack;\r\nand the English withdrew from Montmorenci unmolested, some to the Point\r\nof Orleans, others to Point Levi. On the night of the fourth a fleet of\r\nflatboats passed above the town with the baggage and stores. On the\r\nfifth, Murray, with four battalions, marched up to the River Etechemin,\r\nand forded it under a hot fire from the French batteries at Sillery.\r\nMonckton and Townshend followed with three more battalions, and the\r\nunited force, of about thirty-six hundred men, was embarked on board the\r\nships of Holmes, where Wolfe joined them on the same evening.\r\n\r\nThese movements of the English filled the French commanders with\r\nmingled perplexity, anxiety, and hope. A deserter told them that Admiral\r\nSaunders was impatient to be gone. Vaudreuil grew confident. \"The\r\nbreaking up of the camp at Montmorenci,\" he says, \"and the abandonment\r\nof the intrenchments there, the reimbarkation on board the vessels above\r\nQuebec of the troops who had encamped on the south bank, the movements\r\nof these vessels, the removal of the heaviest pieces of artillery from\r\nthe batteries of Point Levi,--these and the lateness of the season all\r\ncombined to announce the speedy departure of the fleet, several vessels\r\nof which had even sailed down the river already. The prisoners and the\r\ndeserters who daily came in told us that this was the common report in\r\ntheir army.\"[756] He wrote to Bourlamaque on the first of September:\r\n\"Everything proves that the grand design of the English has failed.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 756: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 5 Oct. 1759._]\r\n\r\nYet he was ceaselessly watchful. So was Montcalm; and he, too, on the\r\nnight of the second, snatched a moment to write to Bourlamaque from his\r\nheadquarters in the stone house, by the river of Beauport: \"The night is\r\ndark; it rains; our troops are in their tents, with clothes on, ready\r\nfor an alarm; I in my boots; my horses saddled. In fact, this is my\r\nusual way. I wish you were here; for I cannot be everywhere, though I\r\nmultiply myself, and have not taken off my clothes since the\r\ntwenty-third of June.\" On the eleventh of September he wrote his last\r\nletter to Bourlamaque, and probably the last that his pen ever traced.\r\n\"I am overwhelmed with work, and should often lose temper, like you, if\r\nI did not remember that I am paid by Europe for not losing it. Nothing\r\nnew since my last. I give the enemy another month, or something less, to\r\nstay here.\" The more sanguine Vaudreuil would hardly give them a week.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, no precaution was spared. The force under Bougainville above\r\nQuebec was raised to three thousand men.[757] He was ordered to watch\r\nthe shore as far as Jacques-Cartier, and follow with his main body every\r\nmovement of Holmes's squadron. There was little fear for the heights\r\nnear the town; they were thought inaccessible.[758] Even Montcalm\r\nbelieved them safe, and had expressed himself to that effect some time\r\nbefore. \"We need not suppose,\" he wrote to Vaudreuil, \"that the enemy\r\nhave wings;\" and again, speaking of the very place where Wolfe\r\nafterwards landed, \"I swear to you that a hundred men posted there would\r\nstop their whole army.\"[759] He was right. A hundred watchful and\r\ndetermined men could have held the position long enough for\r\nreinforcements to come up.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 757: _Journal du Siége_ (Bibliothêque de Hartwell). _Journal\r\ntenu à l'Armée, etc. Vaudreuil au Ministre, 5 Oct._ 1759.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 758: Pontbriand, _Jugement impartial._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 759: _Montcalm à Vaudreuil, 27 Juillet. Ibid., 29 Juillet,\r\n1759_.] The hundred men were there. Captain de Vergor, of the colony\r\ntroops, commanded them, and reinforcements were within his call; for the\r\nbattalion of Guienne had been ordered to encamp close at hand on the\r\nPlains of Abraham.[760] Vergor's post, called Anse du Foulon, was a mile\r\nand a half from Quebec. A little beyond it, by the brink of the cliffs,\r\nwas another post, called Samos, held by seventy men with four cannon;\r\nand, beyond this again, the heights of Sillery were guarded by a hundred\r\nand thirty men, also with cannon.[761] These were outposts of\r\nBougainville, whose headquarters were at Cap-Rouge, six miles above\r\nSillery, and whose troops were in continual movement along the\r\nintervening shore. Thus all was vigilance; for while the French were\r\nstrong in the hope of speedy delivery, they felt that there was no\r\nsafety till the tents of the invader had vanished from their shores and\r\nhis ships from their river. \"What we knew,\" says one of them, \"of the\r\ncharacter of M. Wolfe, that impetuous, bold, and intrepid warrior,\r\nprepared us for a last attack before he left us.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 760: Foligny, _Journal mémoratif. Journal tenu à l'Armée_,\r\netc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 761: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 5 Oct._ 1759.]\r\n\r\nWolfe had been very ill on the evening of the fourth. The troops knew\r\nit, and their spirits sank; but, after a night of torment, he grew\r\nbetter, and was soon among them again, rekindling their ardor, and\r\nimparting a cheer that he could not share. For himself he had no pity;\r\nbut when he heard of the illness of two officers in one of the ships, he\r\nsent them a message of warm sympathy, advised them to return to Point\r\nLevi, and offered them his own barge and an escort. They thanked him,\r\nbut replied that, come what might, they would see the enterprise to an\r\nend. Another officer remarked in his hearing that one of the invalids\r\nhad a very delicate constitution. \"Don't tell me of constitution,\" said\r\nWolfe; \"he has good spirit, and good spirit will carry a man through\r\neverything.\"[762] An immense moral force bore up his own frail body and\r\nforced it to its work.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 762: Knox, II. 61, 65.]\r\n\r\nMajor Robert Stobo, who, five years before, had been given as a hostage\r\nto the French at the capture of Fort Necessity, arrived about this time\r\nin a vessel from Halifax. He had long been a prisoner at Quebec, not\r\nalways in close custody, and had used his opportunities to acquaint\r\nhimself with the neighborhood. In the spring of this year he and an\r\nofficer of rangers named Stevens had made their escape with\r\nextraordinary skill and daring; and he now returned to give his\r\ncountrymen the benefit of his local knowledge.[763] His biographer says\r\nthat it was he who directed Wolfe in the choice of a landing-place.[764]\r\nBe this as it may, Wolfe in person examined the river and the shores as\r\nfar as Pointe-aux-Trembles; till at length, landing on the south side a\r\nlittle above Quebec, and looking across the water with a telescope, he\r\ndescried a path that ran with a long slope up the face of the woody\r\nprecipice, and saw at the top a cluster of tents. They were those of\r\nVergor's guard at the Anse du Foulon, now called Wolfe's Cove. As he\r\ncould see but ten or twelve of them, he thought that the guard could not\r\nbe numerous, and might be overpowered. His hope would have been stronger\r\nif he had known that Vergor had once been tried for misconduct and\r\ncowardice in the surrender of Beauséjour, and saved from merited\r\ndisgrace by the friendship of Bigot and the protection of\r\nVaudreuil.[765]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 763: Letters in _Boston Post Boy,_ No. 97, and _Boston Evening\r\nPost,_ No. 1,258.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 764: _Memoirs of Major Robert Stobo._ Curious, but often\r\ninexact.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 765: See _supra_, p. 186.]\r\n\r\nThe morning of the seventh was fair and warm, and the vessels of Holmes,\r\ntheir crowded decks gay with scarlet uniforms, sailed up the river to\r\nCap-Rouge. A lively scene awaited them; for here were the headquarters\r\nof Bougainville, and here lay his principal force, while the rest\r\nwatched the banks above and below. The cove into which the little river\r\nruns was guarded by floating batteries; the surrounding shore was\r\ndefended by breastworks; and a large body of regulars, militia, and\r\nmounted Canadians in blue uniforms moved to and fro, with restless\r\nactivity, on the hills behind. When the vessels came to anchor, the\r\nhorsemen dismounted and formed in line with the infantry; then, with\r\nloud shouts, the whole rushed down the heights to man their works at the\r\nshore. That true Briton, Captain Knox, looked on with a critical eye\r\nfrom the gangway of his ship, and wrote that night in his Diary that\r\nthey had made a ridiculous noise. \"How different!\" he exclaims, \"how\r\nnobly awful and expressive of true valor is the customary silence of the\r\nBritish troops!\"\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the ships opened fire, while the troops entered the\r\nboats and rowed up and down as if looking for a landing-place. It was\r\nbut a feint of Wolfe to deceive Bougainville as to his real design. A\r\nheavy easterly rain set in on the next morning, and lasted two days\r\nwithout respite. All operations were suspended, and the men suffered\r\ngreatly in the crowded transports. Half of them were therefore landed on\r\nthe south shore, where they made their quarters in the village of St.\r\nNicholas, refreshed themselves, and dried their wet clothing, knapsacks,\r\nand blankets.\r\n\r\nFor several successive days the squadron of Holmes was allowed to drift\r\nup the river with the flood tide and down with the ebb, thus passing and\r\nrepassing incessantly between the neighborhood of Quebec on one hand,\r\nand a point high above Cap-Rouge on the other; while Bougainville,\r\nperplexed, and always expecting an attack, followed the ships to and fro\r\nalong the shore, by day and by night, till his men were exhausted with\r\nceaseless forced marches.[766]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 766: Joannès, Major de Quebec, _Mémoire sur la Campagne de_\r\n1759.]\r\n\r\nAt last the time for action came. On Wednesday, the twelfth, the troops\r\nat St. Nicholas were embarked again, and all were told to hold\r\nthemselves in readiness. Wolfe, from the flagship \"Sutherland,\" issued\r\nhis last general orders. \"The enemy's force is now divided, great\r\nscarcity of provisions in their camp, and universal discontent among the\r\nCanadians. Our troops below are in readiness to join us; all the light\r\nartillery and tools are embarked at the Point of Levi; and the troops\r\nwill land where the French seem least to expect it. The first body that\r\ngets on shore is to march directly to the enemy and drive them from any\r\nlittle post they may occupy; the officers must be careful that the\r\nsucceeding bodies do not by any mistake fire on those who go before\r\nthem. The battalions must form on the upper ground with expedition, and\r\nbe ready to charge whatever presents itself. When the artillery and\r\ntroops are landed, a corps will be left to secure the landing-place,\r\nwhile the rest march on and endeavor to bring the Canadians and French\r\nto a battle. The officers and men will remember what their country\r\nexpects from them, and what a determined body of soldiers inured to war\r\nis capable of doing against five weak French battalions mingled with a\r\ndisorderly peasantry.\"\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the army answered to that of its chief. The troops loved\r\nand admired their general, trusted their officers, and were ready for\r\nany attempt. \"Nay, how could it be otherwise,\" quaintly asks honest\r\nSergeant John Johnson, of the fifty-eighth regiment, \"being at the heels\r\nof gentlemen whose whole thirst, equal with their general, was for\r\nglory? We had seen them tried, and always found them sterling. We knew\r\nthat they would stand by us to the last extremity.\"\r\n\r\nWolfe had thirty-six hundred men and officers with him on board the\r\nvessels of Holmes; and he now sent orders to Colonel Burton at Point\r\nLevi to bring to his aid all who could be spared from that place and the\r\nPoint of Orleans. They were to march along the south bank, after\r\nnightfall, and wait further orders at a designated spot convenient for\r\nembarkation. Their number was about twelve hundred, so that the entire\r\nforced destined for the enterprise was at the utmost forty-eight\r\nhundred.[767] With these, Wolfe meant to climb the heights of Abraham in\r\nthe teeth of an enemy who, though much reduced, were still twice as\r\nnumerous as their assailants.[768]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 767: See Note, end of chapter.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 768: Including Bougainville's command. An escaped prisoner\r\ntold Wolfe, a few days before, that Montcalm still had fourteen thousand\r\nmen. _Journal of an Expedition on the River St. Lawrence._ This meant\r\nonly those in the town and the camps of Beauport. \"I don't believe their\r\nwhole army amounts to that number,\" wrote Wolfe to Colonel Burton, on\r\nthe tenth. He knew, however, that if Montcalm could bring all his troops\r\ntogether, the French would outnumber him more than two to one.]\r\n\r\nAdmiral Saunders lay with the main fleet in the Basin of Quebec. This\r\nexcellent officer, whatever may have been his views as to the necessity\r\nof a speedy departure, aided Wolfe to the last with unfailing energy and\r\nzeal. It was agreed between them that while the General made the real\r\nattack, the Admiral should engage Montcalm's attention by a pretended\r\none. As night approached, the fleet ranged itself along the Beauport\r\nshore; the boats were lowered and filled with sailors, marines, and the\r\nfew troops that had been left behind; while ship signalled to ship,\r\ncannon flashed and thundered, and shot ploughed the beach, as if to\r\nclear a way for assailants to land. In the gloom of the evening the\r\neffect was imposing. Montcalm, who thought that the movements of the\r\nEnglish above the town were only a feint, that their main force was\r\nstill below it, and that their real attack would be made there, was\r\ncompletely deceived, and massed his troops in front of Beauport to repel\r\nthe expected landing. But while in the fleet of Saunders all was uproar\r\nand ostentatious menace, the danger was ten miles away, where the\r\nsquadron of Holmes lay tranquil and silent at its anchorage off\r\nCap-Rouge.\r\n\r\nIt was less tranquil than it seemed. All on board knew that a blow would\r\nbe struck that night, though only a few high officers knew where.\r\nColonel Howe, of the light infantry, called for volunteers to lead the\r\nunknown and desperate venture, promising, in the words of one of them,\r\n\"that if any of us survived we might depend on being recommended to the\r\nGeneral.\"[769] As many as were wanted--twenty-four in all--soon came\r\nforward. Thirty large bateaux and some boats belonging to the squadron\r\nlay moored alongside the vessels; and late in the evening the troops\r\nwere ordered into them, the twenty-four volunteers taking their place in\r\nthe foremost. They held in all about seventeen hundred men. The rest\r\nremained on board.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 769: _Journal of the Particular Transactions during the Siege\r\nof Quebec_. The writer, a soldier in the light infantry, says he was one\r\nof the first eight who came forward. See _Notes and Queries_, XX. 370.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBougainville could discern the movement, and misjudged it, thinking that\r\nhe himself was to be attacked. The tide was still flowing; and, the\r\nbetter to deceive him, the vessels and boats were allowed to drift\r\nupward with it for a little distance, as if to land above Cap-Rouge.\r\n\r\nThe day had been fortunate for Wolfe. Two deserters came from the camp\r\nof Bougainville with intelligence that, at ebb tide on the next night,\r\nhe was to send down a convoy of provisions to Montcalm. The necessities\r\nof the camp at Beauport, and the difficulties of transportation by land,\r\nhad before compelled the French to resort to this perilous means of\r\nconveying supplies; and their boats, drifting in darkness under the\r\nshadows of the northern shore, had commonly passed in safety. Wolfe saw\r\nat once that, if his own boats went down in advance of the convoy, he\r\ncould turn the intelligence of the deserters to good account.\r\n\r\nHe was still on board the \"Sutherland.\" Every preparation was made, and\r\nevery order given; it only remained to wait the turning of the tide.\r\nSeated with him in the cabin was the commander of the sloop-of-war\r\n\"Porcupine,\" his former school-fellow, John Jervis, afterwards Earl St.\r\nVincent. Wolfe told him that he expected to die in the battle of the\r\nnext day; and taking from his bosom a miniature of Miss Lowther, his\r\nbetrothed, he gave it to him with a request that he would return it to\r\nher if the presentiment should prove true.[770]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 770: Tucker, _Life of Earl St. Vincent_, I. 19. (London,\r\n1844.)]\r\n\r\nTowards two o'clock the tide began to ebb, and a fresh wind blew down\r\nthe river. Two lanterns were raised into the maintop shrouds of the\r\n\"Sutherland.\" It was the appointed signal; the boats cast off and fell\r\ndown with the current, those of the light infantry leading the way. The\r\nvessels with the rest of the troops had orders to follow a little later.\r\n\r\nTo look for a moment at the chances on which this bold adventure hung.\r\nFirst, the deserters told Wolfe that provision-boats were ordered to go\r\ndown to Quebec that night; secondly, Bougainville countermanded them;\r\nthirdly, the sentries posted along the heights were told of the order,\r\nbut not of the countermand;[771] fourthly, Vergor at the Anse du Foulon\r\nhad permitted most of his men, chiefly Canadians from Lorette, to go\r\nhome for a time and work at their harvesting, on condition, it is said,\r\nthat they should afterwards work in a neighboring field of his own;[772]\r\nfifthly, he kept careless watch, and went quietly to bed; sixthly, the\r\nbattalion of Guienne, ordered to take post on the Plains of Abraham,\r\nhad, for reasons unexplained, remained encamped by the St. Charles;[773]\r\nand lastly, when Bougainville saw Holmes's vessels drift down the\r\nstream, he did not tax his weary troops to follow them, thinking that\r\nthey would return as usual with the flood tide.[774] But for these\r\nconspiring circumstances New France might have lived a little longer,\r\nand the fruitless heroism of Wolfe would have passed, with countless\r\nother heroisms, into oblivion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 771: _Journal tenu à l'Armée_, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 772: _Mémoires sur le Canada_, 1749-1760.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 773: Foligny, _Journal mémoratif. Journal à l'Armée_, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 774: Johnstone, _Dialogue. Vaudreuil au Ministre, 5\r\nOct._1759.]\r\n\r\nFor full two hours the procession of boats, borne on the current,\r\nsteered silently down the St. Lawrence. The stars were visible, but the\r\nnight was moonless and sufficiently dark. The General was in one of the\r\nforemost boats, and near him was a young midshipman, John Robison,\r\nafterwards professor of natural philosophy in the University of\r\nEdinburgh. He used to tell in his later life how Wolfe, with a low\r\nvoice, repeated Gray's _Elegy in a Country Churchyard_ to the officers\r\nabout him. Probably it was to relieve the intense strain of his\r\nthoughts. Among the rest was the verse which his own fate was soon to\r\nillustrate,--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The paths of glory lead but to the grave.\"\r\nP/\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, as his recital ended, \"I would rather have written\r\nthose lines than take Quebec.\" None were there to tell him that the hero\r\nis greater than the poet.\r\n\r\nAs they neared their destination, the tide bore them in towards the\r\nshore, and the mighty wall of rock and forest towered in darkness on\r\ntheir left. The dead stillness was suddenly broken by the sharp _Qui\r\nvive!_ of a French sentry, invisible in the thick gloom. _France!_\r\nanswered a Highland officer of Fraser's regiment from one of the boats\r\nof the light infantry. He had served in Holland and spoke French\r\nfluently.\r\n\r\n_À quel régiment?_\r\n\r\n_De la Reine_, replied the Highlander. He knew that a part of that corps\r\nwas with Bougainville. The sentry, expecting the convoy of provisions,\r\nwas satisfied, and did not ask for the password.\r\n\r\nSoon after, the foremost boats were passing the heights of Samos, when\r\nanother sentry challenged them, and they could see him through the\r\ndarkness running down to the edge of the water, within range of a\r\npistol-shot. In answer to his questions, the same officer replied, in\r\nFrench: \"Provision-boats. Don't make a noise; the English will hear\r\nus.\"[775] In fact, the sloop-of-war \"Hunter\" was anchored in the stream\r\nnot far off. This time, again, the sentry let them pass. In a few\r\nmoments they rounded the headland above the Anse du Foulon. There was no\r\nsentry there. The strong current swept the boats of the light infantry a\r\nlittle below the intended landing-place.[776] They disembarked on a\r\nnarrow strand at the foot of heights as steep as a hill covered with\r\ntrees can be. The twenty-four volunteers led the way, climbing with what\r\nsilence they might, closely followed by a much larger body. When they\r\nreached the top they saw in the dim light a cluster of tents at a short\r\ndistance, and immediately made a dash at them. Vergor leaped from bed\r\nand tried to run off, but was shot in the heel and captured. His men,\r\ntaken by surprise, made little resistance. One or two were caught, the\r\nrest fled.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 775: See a note of Smollett, _History of England_, V. 56 (ed.\r\n1805). Sergeant Johnson, Vaudreuil, Foligny, and the _Journal of\r\nParticular Transactions_ give similar accounts.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 776: _Saunders to Pitt_, 20 Sept. _Journal of Sergeant\r\nJohnson_. Compare Knox, II. 67.]\r\n\r\nThe main body of troops waited in their boats by the edge of the strand.\r\nThe heights near by were cleft by a great ravine choked with forest\r\ntrees; and in its depths ran a little brook called Ruisseau St.-Denis,\r\nwhich, swollen by the late rains, fell plashing in the stillness over a\r\nrock. Other than this no sound could reach the strained ear of Wolfe but\r\nthe gurgle of the tide and the cautious climbing of his advance-parties\r\nas they mounted the steeps at some little distance from where he sat\r\nlistening. At length from the top came a sound of musket-shots, followed\r\nby loud huzzas, and he knew that his men were masters of the position.\r\nThe word was given; the troops leaped from the boats and scaled the\r\nheights, some here, some there, clutching at trees and bushes, their\r\nmuskets slung at their backs. Tradition still points out the place,\r\nnear the mouth of the ravine, where the foremost reached the top. Wolfe\r\nsaid to an officer near him: \"You can try it, but I don't think you'll\r\nget up.\" He himself, however, found strength to drag himself up with the\r\nrest. The narrow slanting path on the face of the heights had been made\r\nimpassable by trenches and abattis; but all obstructions were soon\r\ncleared away, and then the ascent was easy. In the gray of the morning\r\nthe long file of red-coated soldiers moved quickly upward, and formed in\r\norder on the plateau above.\r\n\r\nBefore many of them had reached the top, cannon were heard close on the\r\nleft. It was the battery at Samos firing on the boats in the rear and\r\nthe vessels descending from Cap-Rouge. A party was sent to silence it;\r\nthis was soon effected, and the more distant battery at Sillery was next\r\nattacked and taken. As fast as the boats were emptied they returned for\r\nthe troops left on board the vessels and for those waiting on the\r\nsouthern shore under Colonel Burton.\r\n\r\nThe day broke in clouds and threatening rain. Wolfe's battalions were\r\ndrawn up along the crest of the heights. No enemy was in sight, though a\r\nbody of Canadians had sallied from the town and moved along the strand\r\ntowards the landing-place, whence they were quickly driven back. He had\r\nachieved the most critical part of his enterprise; yet the success that\r\nhe coveted placed him in imminent danger. On one side was the garrison\r\nof Quebec and the army of Beauport, and Bougainville was on the other.\r\nWolfe's alternative was victory or ruin; for if he should be overwhelmed\r\nby a combined attack, retreat would be hopeless. His feelings no man can\r\nknow; but it would be safe to say that hesitation or doubt had no part\r\nin them.\r\n\r\nHe went to reconnoitre the ground, and soon came to the Plains of\r\nAbraham, so called from Abraham Martin, a pilot known as Maître Abraham,\r\nwho had owned a piece of land here in the early times of the colony. The\r\nPlains were a tract of grass, tolerably level in most parts, patched\r\nhere and there with cornfields, studded with clumps of bushes, and\r\nforming a part of the high plateau at the eastern end of which Quebec\r\nstood. On the south it was bounded by the declivities along the St.\r\nLawrence; on the north, by those along the St. Charles, or rather along\r\nthe meadows through which that lazy stream crawled like a writhing\r\nsnake. At the place that Wolfe chose for his battle-field the plateau\r\nwas less than a mile wide.\r\n\r\nThither the troops advanced, marched by files till they reached the\r\nground, and then wheeled to form their line of battle, which stretched\r\nacross the plateau and faced the city. It consisted of six battalions\r\nand the detached grenadiers from Louisbourg, all drawn up in ranks three\r\ndeep. Its right wing was near the brink of the heights along the St.\r\nLawrence; but the left could not reach those along the St. Charles. On\r\nthis side a wide space was perforce left open, and there was danger of\r\nbeing outflanked. To prevent this, Brigadier Townshend was stationed\r\nhere with two battalions, drawn up at right angles with the rest, and\r\nfronting the St. Charles. The battalion of Webb's regiment, under\r\nColonel Burton, formed the reserve; the third battalion of Royal\r\nAmericans was left to guard the landing; and Howe's light infantry\r\noccupied a wood far in the rear. Wolfe, with Monckton and Murray,\r\ncommanded the front line, on which the heavy fighting was to fall, and\r\nwhich, when all the troops had arrived, numbered less than thirty-five\r\nhundred men.[777]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 777: See Note, end of chapter.]\r\n\r\nQuebec was not a mile distant, but they could not see it; for a ridge of\r\nbroken ground intervened, called Buttes-à-Neveu, about six hundred paces\r\noff. The first division of troops had scarcely come up when, about six\r\no'clock, this ridge was suddenly thronged with white uniforms. It was\r\nthe battalion of Guienne, arrived at the eleventh hour from its camp by\r\nthe St. Charles. Some time after there was hot firing in the rear. It\r\ncame from a detachment of Bougainville's command attacking a house where\r\nsome of the light infantry were posted. The assailants were repulsed,\r\nand the firing ceased. Light showers fell at intervals, besprinkling the\r\ntroops as they stood patiently waiting the event.\r\n\r\nMontcalm had passed a troubled night. Through all the evening the cannon\r\nbellowed from the ships of Saunders, and the boats of the fleet hovered\r\nin the dusk off the Beauport shore, threatening every moment to land.\r\nTroops lined intrenchments till day, while the General walked the field\r\nthat adjoined his headquarters till one in the morning, accompanied by\r\nthe Chevalier Johnstone and Colonel Poulariez. Johnstone says that he\r\nwas in great agitation, and took no rest all night. At daybreak he heard\r\nthe sound of cannon above the town. It was the battery at Samos firing\r\non the English ships. He had sent an officer to the quarters of\r\nVaudreuil, which were much nearer Quebec, with orders to bring him word\r\nat once should anything unusual happen. But no word came, and about six\r\no'clock he mounted and rode thither with Johnstone. As they advanced,\r\nthe country behind the town opened more and more upon their sight; till\r\nat length, when opposite Vaudreuil's house, they saw across the St.\r\nCharles, some two miles away, the red ranks of British soldiers on the\r\nheights beyond.\r\n\r\n\"This is a serious business,\" Montcalm said; and sent off Johnstone at\r\nfull gallop to bring up the troops from the centre and left of the camp.\r\nThose of the right were in motion already, doubtless by the Governor's\r\norder. Vaudreuil came out of the house. Montcalm stopped for a few words\r\nwith him; then set spurs to his horse, and rode over the bridge of the\r\nSt. Charles to the scene of danger.[778] He rode with a fixed look,\r\nuttering not a word.[779]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 778: Johnstone, _Dialogue_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 779: _Malartic à Bourlamaque,--Sept_. 1759.]\r\n\r\nThe army followed in such order as it might, crossed the bridge in hot\r\nhaste, passed under the northern rampart of Quebec, entered at the\r\nPalace Gate, and pressed on in headlong march along the quaint narrow\r\nstreets of the warlike town: troops of Indians in scalp-locks and\r\nwar-paint, a savage glitter in their deep-set eyes; bands of Canadians\r\nwhose all was at stake,--faith, country, and home; the colony regulars;\r\nthe battalions of Old France, a torrent of white uniforms and gleaming\r\nbayonets, La Sarre, Languedoc, Roussillon, Béarn,--victors of Oswego,\r\nWilliam Henry, and Ticonderoga. So they swept on, poured out upon the\r\nplain, some by the gate of St. Louis, and some by that of St. John, and\r\nhurried, breathless, to where the banners of Guienne still fluttered on\r\nthe ridge.\r\n\r\nMontcalm was amazed at what he saw. He had expected a detachment, and he\r\nfound an army. Full in sight before him stretched the lines of Wolfe:\r\nthe close ranks of the English infantry, a silent wall of red, and the\r\nwild array of the Highlanders, with their waving tartans, and bagpipes\r\nscreaming defiance. Vaudreuil had not come; but not the less was felt\r\nthe evil of a divided authority and the jealousy of the rival chiefs.\r\nMontcalm waited long for the forces he had ordered to join him from the\r\nleft wing of the army. He waited in vain. It is said that the Governor\r\nhad detained them, lest the English should attack the Beauport shore.\r\nEven if they did so, and succeeded, the French might defy them, could\r\nthey but put Wolfe to rout on the Plains of Abraham. Neither did the\r\ngarrison of Quebec come to the aid of Montcalm. He sent to Ramesay, its\r\ncommander, for twenty-five field-pieces which were on the Palace\r\nbattery. Ramesay would give him only three, saying that he wanted them\r\nfor his own defence. There were orders and counter-orders;\r\nmisunderstanding, haste, delay, perplexity.\r\n\r\nMontcalm and his chief officers held a council of war. It is said that\r\nhe and they alike were for immediate attack. His enemies declare that he\r\nwas afraid lest Vaudreuil should arrive and take command; but the\r\nGovernor was not a man to assume responsibility at such a crisis. Others\r\nsay that his impetuosity overcame his better judgment; and of this\r\ncharge it is hard to acquit him. Bougainville was but a few miles\r\ndistant, and some of his troops were much nearer; a messenger sent by\r\nway of Old Lorette could have reached him in an hour and a half at most,\r\nand a combined attack in front and rear might have been concerted with\r\nhim. If, moreover, Montcalm could have come to an understanding with\r\nVaudreuil, his own force might have been strengthened by two or three\r\nthousand additional men from the town and the camp of Beauport; but he\r\nfelt that there was no time to lose, for he imagined that Wolfe would\r\nsoon be reinforced, which was impossible, and he believed that the\r\nEnglish were fortifying themselves, which was no less an error. He has\r\nbeen blamed not only for fighting too soon, but for fighting at all. In\r\nthis he could not choose. Fight he must, for Wolfe was now in a position\r\nto cut off all his supplies. His men were full of ardor, and he resolved\r\nto attack before their ardor cooled. He spoke a few words to them in his\r\nkeen, vehement way. \"I remember very well how he looked,\" one of the\r\nCanadians, then a boy of eighteen, used to say in his old age; \"he rode\r\na black or dark bay horse along the front of our lines, brandishing his\r\nsword, as if to excite us to do our duty. He wore a coat with wide\r\nsleeves, which fell back as he raised his arm, and showed the white\r\nlinen of the wristband.\"[780]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 780: _Recollections of Joseph Trahan_, in _Revue Canadienne_,\r\nIV.]\r\n\r\nThe English waited the result with a composure which, if not quite real,\r\nwas at least well feigned. The three field-pieces sent by Ramesay plied\r\nthem with canister-shot, and fifteen hundred Canadians and Indians\r\nfusilladed them in front and flank. Over all the plain, from behind\r\nbushes and knolls and the edge of cornfields, puffs of smoke sprang\r\nincessantly from the guns of these hidden marksmen. Skirmishers were\r\nthrown out before the lines to hold them in check, and the soldiers were\r\nordered to lie on the grass to avoid the shot. The firing was liveliest\r\non the English left, where bands of sharpshooters got under the edge of\r\nthe declivity, among thickets, and behind scattered houses, whence they\r\nkilled and wounded a considerable number of Townshend's men. The light\r\ninfantry were called up from the rear. The houses were taken and\r\nretaken, and one or more of them was burned.\r\n\r\nWolfe was everywhere. How cool he was, and why his followers loved him,\r\nis shown by an incident that happened in the course of the morning. One\r\nof his captains was shot through the lungs; and on recovering\r\nconsciousness he saw the General standing at his side. Wolfe pressed his\r\nhand, told him not to despair, praised his services, promised him early\r\npromotion, and sent an aide-de-camp to Monckton to beg that officer to\r\nkeep the promise if he himself should fall.[781]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 781: Sir Denis Le Marchant, cited by Wright, 579. Le Marchant\r\nknew the captain in his old age. Monckton kept Wolfe's promise.]\r\n\r\nIt was towards ten o'clock when, from the high ground on the right of\r\nthe line, Wolfe saw that the crisis was near. The French on the ridge\r\nhad formed themselves into three bodies, regulars in the centre,\r\nregulars and Canadians on right and left. Two field-pieces, which had\r\nbeen dragged up the heights at Anse du Foulon, fired on them with\r\ngrapeshot, and the troops, rising from the ground, prepared to receive\r\nthem. In a few moments more they were in motion. They came on rapidly,\r\nuttering loud shouts, and firing as soon as they were within range.\r\nTheir ranks, ill ordered at the best, were further confused by a number\r\nof Canadians who had been mixed among the regulars, and who, after\r\nhastily firing, threw themselves on the ground to reload.[782] The\r\nBritish advanced a few rods; then halted and stood still. When the\r\nFrench were within forty paces the word of command rang out, and a crash\r\nof musketry answered all along the line. The volley was delivered with\r\nremarkable precision. In the battalions of the centre, which had\r\nsuffered least from the enemy's bullets, the simultaneous explosion was\r\nafterwards said by French officers to have sounded like a cannon-shot.\r\nAnother volley followed, and then a furious clattering fire that lasted\r\nbut a minute or two. When the smoke rose, a miserable sight was\r\nrevealed: the ground cumbered with dead and wounded, the advancing\r\nmasses stopped short and turned into a frantic mob, shouting, cursing,\r\ngesticulating. The order was given to charge. Then over the field rose\r\nthe British cheer, mixed with the fierce yell of the Highland slogan.\r\nSome of the corps pushed forward with the bayonet; some advanced\r\nfiring. The clansmen drew their broadswords and dashed on, keen and\r\nswift as bloodhounds. At the English right, though the attacking column\r\nwas broken to pieces, a fire was still kept up, chiefly, it seems, by\r\nsharpshooters from the bushes and cornfields, where they had lain for an\r\nhour or more. Here Wolfe himself led the charge, at the head of the\r\nLouisbourg grenadiers. A shot shattered his wrist. He wrapped his\r\nhandkerchief about it and kept on. Another shot struck him, and he still\r\nadvanced, when a third lodged in his breast. He staggered, and sat on\r\nthe ground. Lieutenant Brown, of the grenadiers, one Henderson, a\r\nvolunteer in the same company, and a private soldier, aided by an\r\nofficer of artillery who ran to join them, carried him in their arms to\r\nthe rear. He begged them to lay him down. They did so, and asked if he\r\nwould have a surgeon. \"There's no need,\" he answered; \"it's all over\r\nwith me.\" A moment after, one of them cried out: \"They run; see how they\r\nrun!\" \"Who run?\" Wolfe demanded, like a man roused from sleep. \"The\r\nenemy, sir. Egad, they give way everywhere!\" \"Go one of you, to Colonel\r\nBurton,\" returned the dying man; \"tell him to march Webb's regiment down\r\nto Charles River, to cut off their retreat from the bridge.\" Then,\r\nturning on his side, he murmured, \"Now, God be praised, I will die in\r\npeace!\" and in a few moments his gallant soul had fled.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 782: \"Les Canadiens, qui étaient mêlés dans les bataillons, se\r\npassèrent de tirer et, dès qu'ils l'eussent fait, de mettre ventre a\r\nterre pour charger, ce qui rompit tout l'ordre.\" _Malartic a\r\nBourlamaque, 25 Sept._ 1759.]\r\n\r\nMontcalm, still on horseback, was borne with the tide of fugitives\r\ntowards the town. As he approached the walls a shot passed through his\r\nbody. He kept his seat; two soldiers supported him, one on each side,\r\nand led his horse through the St. Louis Gate. On the open space within,\r\namong the excited crowd, were several women, drawn, no doubt, by\r\neagerness to know the result of the fight. One of them recognized him,\r\nsaw the streaming blood, and shrieked, \"_O mon Dieu! mon Dieu! le\r\nMarquis est tué!_\" \"It's nothing, it's nothing,\" replied the\r\ndeath-stricken man; \"don't be troubled for me, my good friends.\" _(\"Ce\r\nn'est rien, ce n'est rien; ne vous affligez pas pour moi, mes bonnes\r\namies.\")_\r\n\r\nNOTE: There are several contemporary versions of the dying words of\r\nWolfe. The report of Knox, given above, is by far the best attested.\r\nKnox says that he took particular pains at the time to learn them\r\naccurately from those who were with Wolfe when they were uttered.\r\n\r\nThe anecdote of Montcalm is due to the late Hon. Malcolm Fraser, of\r\nQuebec. He often heard it in his youth from an old woman, who, when a\r\ngirl, was one of the group who saw the wounded general led by, and to\r\nwhom the words were addressed.\r\n\r\n_Force of the English and French at the Battle of Quebec._--The tabular\r\nreturn given by Knox shows the number of officers and men in each corps\r\nengaged. According to this, the battalions as they stood on the Plains\r\nof Abraham before the battle varied in strength from 322 (Monckton's) to\r\n683 (Webb's), making a total of 4,828, including officers. But another\r\nreturn, less specific, signed _George Townshend, Brigadier,_ makes the\r\nentire number only 4,441. Townshend succeeded Wolfe in the command; and\r\nthis return, which is preserved in the Public Record Office, was sent to\r\nLondon a few days after the battle. Some French writers present put the\r\nnumber lower, perhaps for the reason that Webb's regiment and the third\r\nbattalion of Royal Americans took no part in the fight, the one being in\r\nthe rear as a reserve, and the other invisible, guarding the landing\r\nplace. Wolfe's front line, which alone met and turned the French attack,\r\nwas made up as follows, the figures including officers and men:--\r\n\r\n/$\r\nThirty-fifth Regiment   .... 519     Twenty-eighth Regiment   421\r\nFifty-eighth     \"      .... 335     Forty-seventh    \"    .  360\r\nSeventy-eighth   \"      .... 662     Forty-third      \"    .. 327\r\nLouisbourg Grenadiers        241     Light Infantry  ........ 400\r\nMaking a total of 3,265.\r\n$/\r\n\r\nThe French force engaged cannot be precisely given. Knox, on\r\ninformation received from \"an intelligent Frenchman,\" states the\r\nnumber, corps by corps, the aggregate being 7,520. This, on examination,\r\nplainly appears exaggerated. Fraser puts it at 5,000; Townshend\r\nat 4,470, including militia. Bigot says, 3,500, which may\r\nperhaps be as many as actually advanced to the attack, since\r\nsome of the militia held back. Including Bougainville's command,\r\nthe militia and the artillerymen left in the Beauport camp, the\r\nsailors at the town batteries, and the garrison of Quebec, at least\r\nas many of the French were out of the battle as were in it; and\r\nthe numbers engaged on each side seem to have been about equal.\r\n\r\nFor authorities of the foregoing chapter, see Appendix I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 28\r\n\r\n1759\r\n\r\nFall of Quebec\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Never was rout more complete than that of our army,\"\r\nsays a French official.[783] It was the more so because Montcalm\r\nheld no troops in reserve, but launched his whole force at\r\nonce against the English. Nevertheless there was some resistance\r\nto the pursuit. It came chiefly from the Canadians, many of whom had\r\nnot advanced with the regulars to the attack. Those on the right wing,\r\ninstead of doing so, threw themselves into an extensive tract of\r\nbushes that lay in front of the English left; and from this cover\r\nthey opened a fire, too distant for much effect, till the victors\r\nadvanced in their turn, when the shot of the hidden marksmen told\r\nseverely upon them. Two battalions, therefore, deployed before the\r\nbushes, fired volleys into them, and drove their occupants out.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 783: _Daine au Ministre, 9 Oct. 1759_.]\r\n\r\nAgain, those of the Canadians who, before the main battle\r\nbegan, attacked the English left from the brink of the plateau\r\ntowards the St. Charles, withdrew when the rout took place,\r\nand ran along the edge of the declivity till, at the part of it\r\ncalled Côte Ste.-Geneviève, they came to a place where it\r\nwas overgrown with thickets. Into these they threw themselves;\r\nand were no sooner under cover than they faced about to fire upon\r\nthe Highlanders, who presently came up. As many of these mountaineers,\r\naccording to their old custom, threw down their muskets when they\r\ncharged, and had no weapons but their broadswords, they tried in vain\r\nto dislodge the marksmen, and suffered greatly in the attempt. Other\r\ntroops came to their aid, cleared the thickets, after stout resistance,\r\nand drove their occupants across the meadow to the bridge of boats.\r\nThe conduct of the Canadians at the Côte Ste.-Geneviève went far to\r\natone for the short-comings of some of them on the battle-field.\r\n\r\nA part of the fugitives escaped into the town by the gates\r\nof St. Louis and St. John, while the greater number fled along\r\nthe front of the ramparts, rushed down the declivity to the\r\nsuburb of St. Roch, and ran over the meadows to the bridge,\r\nprotected by the cannon of the town and the two armed hulks\r\nin the river. The rout had but just begun when Vaudreuil\r\ncrossed the bridge from the camp of Beauport. It was four\r\nhours since he first heard the alarm, and his quarters were\r\nnot much more than two miles from the battle-field. He does\r\nnot explain why he did not come sooner; it is certain that his\r\ncoming was well timed to throw the blame on Montcalm in\r\ncase of defeat, or to claim some of the honor for himself in\r\ncase of victory. \"Monsieur the Marquis of Montcalm,\" he\r\nsays, \"unfortunately made his attack before I had joined\r\nhim.\"[784] His joining him could have done no good; for though\r\nhe had at last brought with him the rest of the militia from\r\nthe Beauport camp, they had come no farther than the bridge\r\nover the St. Charles, having, as he alleges, been kept there by\r\nan unauthorized order from the chief of staff, Montreuil.[785]\r\nHe declares that the regulars were in such a fright that he\r\ncould not stop them; but that the Canadians listened to his\r\nvoice, and that it was he who rallied them at the Côte Ste.-Geneviève.\r\nOf this the evidence is his own word. From other accounts it would\r\nappear that the Canadians rallied themselves. Vaudreuil lost no time\r\nin recrossing the bridge and joining the militia in the redoubt at\r\nthe farther end, where a crowd of fugitives soon poured in after him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 784: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 21 Sept. 1759_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 785: _Ibid., 5 Oct. 1759_.]\r\n\r\nThe aide-de-camp Johnstone, mounted on horseback, had\r\nstopped for a moment in what is now the suburb of St. John\r\nto encourage some soldiers who were trying to save a cannon\r\nthat had stuck fast in a marshy hollow; when, on spurring\r\nhis horse to the higher ground, he saw within musket-shot\r\na long line of British troops, who immediately fired upon him.\r\nThe bullets whistled about his ears, tore his clothes, and\r\nwounded his horse; which, however, carried him along the\r\nedge of the declivity to a windmill, near which was a roadway\r\nto a bakehouse on the meadow below. He descended, crossed the\r\nmeadow, reached the bridge, and rode over it to the great redoubt\r\nor hornwork that guarded its head.\r\n\r\nThe place was full of troops and Canadians in a wild panic.\r\n\"It is impossible,\" says Johnstone, \"to imagine the disorder\r\nand confusion I found in the hornwork. Consternation was\r\ngeneral. M. de Vaudreuil listened to everybody, and was always\r\nof the opinion of him who spoke last. On the appearance\r\nof the English troops on the plain by the bakehouse,\r\nMontguet and La Motte, two old captains in the regiment of\r\nBéarn, cried out with vehemence to M. de Vaudreuil 'that\r\nthe hornwork would be taken in an instant by assault, sword\r\nin hand; that we all should be cut to pieces without quarter;\r\nand that nothing would save us but an immediate and general\r\ncapitulation of Canada, giving it up to the English.'\"[786] Yet\r\nthe river was wide and deep, and the hornwork was protected\r\non the water side by strong palisades, with cannon. Nevertheless\r\nthere rose a general cry to cut the bridge of boats. By\r\ndoing so more than half the army, who had not yet crossed,\r\nwould have been sacrificed. The axemen were already at work,\r\nwhen they were stopped by some officers who had not lost\r\ntheir wits.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 786: Confirmed by _Journal tenu à l'Armée,_ etc. \"Divers\r\nofficiers des troupes de terre n'hésitèrent point à dire, tout haut\r\nen présence du soldat, qu'il ne nous restoit d'autre ressource que\r\ncelle de capituler promptement pour toute la colonie,\" etc.]\r\n\r\n\"M. de Vaudreuil,\" pursues Johnstone, \"was closeted in a\r\nhouse in the inside of the hornwork with the Intendant and\r\nsome other persons. I suspected they were busy drafting the\r\narticles for a general capitulation, and I entered the house,\r\nwhere I had only time to see the Intendant, with a pen in his\r\nhand, writing upon a sheet of paper, when M. de Vaudreuil\r\ntold me I had no business there. Having answered him that\r\nwhat he had said was true, I retired immediately, in wrath\r\nto see them intent on giving up so scandalously a dependency\r\nfor the preservation of which so much blood and treasure had\r\nbeen expended.\" On going out he met Lieutenant-colonels\r\nDalquier and Poulariez, whom he begged to prevent the apprehended\r\ndisgrace; and, in fact, if Vaudreuil really meant to capitulate for\r\nthe colony, he was presently dissuaded by firmer spirits than his own.\r\n\r\nJohnstone, whose horse could carry him no farther, set out\r\non foot for Beauport, and, in his own words, \"continued\r\nsorrowfully jogging on, with a very heavy heart for the loss\r\nof my dear friend M. de Montcalm, sinking with weariness,\r\nand lost in reflection upon the changes which Providence had\r\nbrought about in the space of three or four hours.\"\r\n\r\nGreat indeed were these changes. Montcalm was dying;\r\nhis second in command, the Brigadier Senezergues, was\r\nmortally wounded; the army, routed and demoralized, was\r\nvirtually without a head; and the colony, yesterday cheered as\r\non the eve of deliverance, was plunged into sudden despair.\r\n\"Ah, what a cruel day!\" cries Bougainville; \"how fatal to all\r\nthat was dearest to us! My heart is torn in its most tender\r\nparts. We shall be fortunate if the approach of winter saves\r\nthe country from total ruin.\"[787]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 787: _Bougainville à Bourlamaque, 18 Sept. 1759_.]\r\n\r\nThe victors were fortifying themselves on the field of battle.\r\nLike the French, they had lost two generals; for Monckton,\r\nsecond in rank, was disabled by a musket-shot, and the command\r\nhad fallen upon Townshend at the moment when the enemy were in full\r\nflight. He had recalled the pursuers, and formed them again in line\r\nof battle, knowing that another foe was at hand. Bougainville, in\r\nfact, appeared at noon from Cap-Rouge with about two thousand men;\r\nbut withdrew on seeing double that force prepared to receive him.\r\nHe had not heard till eight o'clock that the English were on the\r\nPlains of Abraham; and the delay of his arrival was no doubt\r\ndue to his endeavors to collect as many as possible of his\r\ndetachments posted along the St. Lawrence for many miles\r\ntowards Jacques-Cartier.\r\n\r\nBefore midnight the English had made good progress in\r\ntheir redoubts and intrenchments, had brought cannon up\r\nthe heights to defend them, planted a battery on the Côte\r\nSte.-Geneviève, descended into the meadows of the St. Charles,\r\nand taken possession of the General Hospital, with its crowds\r\nof sick and wounded. Their victory had cost them six hundred\r\nand sixty-four of all ranks, killed, wounded, and missing. The\r\nFrench loss is placed by Vaudreuil at about six hundred and forty,\r\nand by the English official reports at about fifteen hundred.\r\nMeasured by the numbers engaged, the battle of Quebec was but a\r\nheavy skirmish; measured by results, it was one of the great battles\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nVaudreuil went from the hornwork to his quarters on the\r\nBeauport road and called a council of war. It was a tumultuous\r\nscene. A letter was despatched to Quebec to ask for advice of Montcalm.\r\nThe dying General sent a brief message to the effect that there was a\r\nthreefold choice,--to fight again, retreat to Jacques-Cartier, or give\r\nup the colony. There was much in favor of fighting. When Bougainville\r\nhad gathered all his force from the river above, he would have three\r\nthousand men; and these, joined to the garrison of Quebec, the\r\nsailors at the batteries, and the militia and artillerymen of the\r\nBeauport camp, would form a body of fresh soldiers more\r\nthan equal to the English then on the Plains of Abraham.\r\nAdd to these the defeated troops, and the victors would be\r\ngreatly outnumbered.[788] Bigot gave his voice for fighting. Vaudreuil\r\nexpressed himself to the same effect; but he says that all\r\nthe officers were against him. \"In vain I remarked to these\r\ngentlemen that we were superior to the enemy, and should\r\nbeat them if we managed well. I could not at all change their\r\nopinion, and my love for the service and for the colony made\r\nme subscribe to the views of the council. In fact, if I had\r\nattacked the English against the advice of all the principal\r\nofficers, their ill-will would have exposed me to the risk of\r\nlosing the battle and the colony also.\"[789]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 788: Bigot, as well as Vaudreuil, sets Bougainville's force\r\nat three thousand. \"En réunissant le corps M. de Bougainville, les\r\nbataillons de Montréal _[laissés au camp de Beauport]_ et la garrison\r\nde la ville, il nous restoit encore près de 5,000 hommes de troupes\r\nfraîches.\" _Journal tenu à l'Armée._ Vaudreuil says that there were\r\nfifteen hundred men in garrison at Quebec who did not take part\r\nin the battle. If this is correct, the number of fresh troops after\r\nit was not five thousand, but more than six thousand; to whom\r\nthe defeated force is to be added, making, after deducting killed\r\nand wounded, some ten thousand in all.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 789: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 5 Oct._ 1759.]\r\n\r\nIt was said at the time that the officers voted for retreat\r\nbecause they thought Vaudreuil unfit to command an army,\r\nand, still more, to fight a battle.[790] There was no need, however,\r\nto fight at once. The object of the English was to take\r\nQuebec, and that of Vaudreuil should have been to keep it.\r\nBy a march of a few miles he could have joined Bougainville;\r\nand by then intrenching himself at or near Ste.-Foy he would\r\nhave placed a greatly superior force in the English rear, where\r\nhis position might have been made impregnable. Here he might be\r\neasily furnished with provisions, and from hence he could readily\r\nthrow men and supplies into Quebec, which the English were too few\r\nto invest. He could harass the besiegers, or attack them, should\r\nopportunity offer, and either raise the siege or so protract it\r\nthat they would be forced by approaching winter to sail homeward,\r\nrobbed of the fruit of their victory.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 790: _Memoires sur le Canada,_ 1749-1760.]\r\n\r\nAt least he might have taken a night for reflection. He was\r\nsafe behind the St. Charles. The English, spent by fighting,\r\ntoil, and want of sleep, were in no condition to disturb him.\r\nA part of his own men were in deadly need of rest; the night\r\nwould have brought refreshment, and the morning might have brought\r\nwise counsel. Vaudreuil would not wait, and orders were given at\r\nonce for retreat.[791] It began at nine o'clock that evening. Quebec\r\nwas abandoned to its fate. The cannon were left in the lines of\r\nBeauport, the tents in the encampments, and provisions enough in\r\nthe storehouses to supply the army for a week. \"The loss of the\r\nMarquis de Montcalm,\" says a French officer then on the spot, \"robbed\r\nhis successors of their senses, and they thought of nothing but flight;\r\nsuch was their fear that the enemy would attack the intrenchments\r\nthe next day. The army abandoned the camp in such disorder\r\nthat the like was never known.\"[792] \"It was not a retreat,\" says\r\nJohnstone, who himself a part of it, \"but an abominable\r\nflight, with such disorder and confusion that, had the English\r\nknown it, three hundred men sent after us would have been\r\nsufficient to cut all our army to pieces. The soldiers were all\r\nmixed, and scattered, dispersed, and running as hard as they\r\ncould, as if the English army were at their heels.\" They\r\npassed Charlesbourg, Lorette, and St. Augustin, till, on the\r\nfifteenth, they found rest on the impregnable hill of Jacques-Cartier,\r\nby the brink of the St. Lawrence, thirty miles from danger.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 791: _Livre d'Ordres, Ordre du 13 Sept_. 1759.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 792: Foligny, _Journal mémoratif._]\r\n\r\nIn the night of humiliation when Vaudreuil abandoned\r\nQuebec, Montcalm was breathing his last within its walls.\r\nWhen he was brought wounded from the field, he was placed\r\nin the house of the Surgeon Arnoux, who was then with Bourlamaque\r\nat Isle-aux-Noix, but whose younger brother, also a surgeon,\r\nexamined the wound and pronounced it mortal. \"I am glad of it,\"\r\nMontcalm said quietly; and then asked how long he had to live.\r\n\"Twelve hours, more or less,\" was the reply. \"So much the better,\"\r\nhe returned. \"I am happy that I shall not live to see the surrender\r\nof Quebec.\" He is reported to have said that since he had lost the battle\r\nit consoled him to have been defeated by so brave an enemy;\r\nand some of his last words were in praise of his successor,\r\nLévis, for whose talents and fitness for command he expressed\r\nhigh esteem. When Vaudreuil sent to ask his opinion, he gave\r\nit; but when Ramesay, commandant of the garrison, came to\r\nreceive his orders, he replied: \"I will neither give orders nor\r\ninterfere any further. I have much business that must be\r\nattended to, of greater moment than your ruined garrison\r\nand this wretched country. My time is very short; therefore\r\npray leave me. I wish you all comfort, and to be happily extricated\r\nfrom your present perplexities.\" Nevertheless he thought to the last\r\nof those who had been under his command, and sent the following note\r\nto Brigadier Townshend: \"Monsieur, the humanity of the English sets\r\nmy mind at peace concerning the fate of the French prisoners and the\r\nCanadians. Feel towards them as they have caused me to feel. Do not\r\nlet them perceive that they have changed masters. Be their protector\r\nas I have been their father.\"[793]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 793: I am indebted to Abbé Bois for a copy of this note. The\r\nlast words of Montcalm, as above, are reported partly by Johnstone,\r\nand partly by Knox.]\r\n\r\nBishop Pontbriand, himself fast sinking with mortal disease,\r\nattended his deathbed and administered the last sacraments.\r\nHe died peacefully at four o'clock on the morning of the\r\nfourteenth. He was in his forty-eighth year.\r\n\r\nIn the confusion of the time no workman could be found\r\nto make a coffin, and an old servant of the Ursulines, known\r\nas Bonhomme Michel, gathered a few boards and nailed them together\r\nso as to form a rough box. In it was laid the body of the dead\r\nsoldier; and late in the evening of the same day he was carried\r\nto his rest. There was no tolling of bells or firing of cannon.\r\nThe officers of the garrison followed the bier, and some of the\r\npopulace, including women and children, joined the procession as\r\nit moved in dreary silence along the dusky street, shattered with\r\ncannon-ball and bomb, to the chapel of the Ursuline convent. Here\r\na shell, bursting under the floor, had made a cavity which had been\r\nhollowed into a grave. Three priests of the Cathedral, several nuns,\r\nRamesay with his officers, and a throng of townspeople were\r\npresent at the rite. After the service and the chant, the\r\nbody was lowered into the grave by the light of torches; and\r\nthen, says the chronicle, \"the tears and sobs burst forth. It\r\nseemed as if the last hope of the colony were buried with the\r\nremains of the General.\"[794] In truth, the funeral of Montcalm\r\nwas the funeral of New France.[795]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 794: _Ursulines de Québec,_ III. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 795: See Appendix J.]\r\n\r\nIt was no time for grief. The demands of the hour were\r\ntoo exigent and stern. When, on the morning after the battle,\r\nthe people of Quebec saw the tents standing in the camp of\r\nBeauport, they thought the army still there to defend them.[796]\r\nRamesay knew that the hope was vain. On the evening before,\r\nVaudreuil had sent two hasty notes to tell him of his flight.\r\n\"The position of the enemy,\" wrote the Governor, \"becomes stronger\r\nevery instant; and this, with other reasons, obliges me to retreat.\"\r\n\"I have received all your letters. As I set out this moment, I pray\r\nyou not to write again. You shall hear from me to-morrow. I wish\r\nyou good evening.\" With these notes came the following order:\r\n\"M. de Ramesay is not to wait till the enemy carries the town by\r\nassault. As soon as provisions fail, he will raise the white flag.\"\r\nThis order was accompanied by a memorandum of terms which Ramesay\r\nwas to ask of the victors.[797]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 796: _Mémoire du Sieur de Ramesay._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 797: _Mémoire pour servir d'Instruction à M. de Ramesay, 13 Sept.\r\n_ 1759. Appended, with the foregoing notes, to the _Mémoire de\r\nRamesay._]\r\n\r\n\"What a blow for me,\" says the unfortunate commandant,\r\n\"to find myself abandoned so soon by the army, which alone\r\ncould defend the town!\" His garrison consisted of between\r\none and two hundred troops of the line, some four or five\r\nhundred colony troops, a considerable number of sailors, and\r\nthe local militia.[798] These last were in a state of despair. The\r\ninhabitants who, during the siege, had sought refuge in the\r\nsuburb of St. Roch, had returned after the battle, and there\r\nwere now twenty-six hundred women and children, with about a\r\nhousand invalids and other non-combatants to be supported, though\r\nthe provisions in the town, even at half rations, would hardly last\r\na week. Ramesay had not been informed that a good supply was left in\r\nthe camps of Beauport; and when he heard at last that it was there,\r\nand sent out parties to get it, they found that the Indians and the\r\nfamished country people had carried it off.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 798: The English returns give a total of 615 French regulars in\r\nthe place besides sailors and militia.]\r\n\r\n\"Despondency,\" he says again, \"was complete; discouragement\r\nextreme and universal. Murmurs and complaints against the army that\r\nhad abandoned us rose to a general outcry. I could not prevent the\r\nmerchants, all of whom were officers of the town militia, from meeting\r\nat the house of M. Daine, the mayor. There they declared for capitulating,\r\nand presented me a petition to that effect, signed by M. Daine and\r\nall the principal citizens.\"\r\n\r\nRamesay called a council of war. One officer alone, Piedmont,\r\ncaptain of artillery, was for reducing the rations still\r\nmore, and holding out to the last. All the others gave their\r\nvoices for capitulation.[799] Ramesay might have yielded without\r\ndishonor; but he still held out till an event fraught with\r\nnew hope took place at Jacques-Cartier.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 799: _Copie du Conseil de Guerre term par M. de Ramesay à Québec,\r\n15 Sept_. 1759.]\r\n\r\nThis event was the arrival of Lévis. On the afternoon of\r\nthe battle Vaudreuil took one rational step; he sent a courier\r\nto Montreal to summon that able officer to his aid.[800] Lévis\r\nset out at once, reached Jacques-Cartier, and found his worst\r\nfears realized. \"The great number of fugitives that I began\r\nto meet at Three Rivers prepared me for the disorder in\r\nwhich I found the army. I never in my life knew the like of\r\nit. They left everything behind in the camp at Beauport; tents,\r\nbaggage, and kettles.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 800: _Lévis à Bourlamaque, 15 Sept_. 1759. Lévis,\r\n_Guerre du Canada._]\r\n\r\nHe spoke his mind freely; loudly blamed the retreat, and\r\nurged Vaudreuil to march back with all speed to whence he\r\ncame.[801] The Governor, stiff at ordinary times, but pliant at\r\na crisis, welcomed the firmer mind that decided for him, consented\r\nthat the troops should return, and wrote afterwards in his despatch\r\nto the Minister: \"I was much charmed to find M. de Lévis disposed\r\nto march with the army towards Quebec.\"[802]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 801: _Bigot au Ministre, 15 Oct. 1759. Malartic à Bourlamaque, 28\r\nSept_. 1759.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 802: \"Je fus bien charmé,\" etc. _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 5 Oct.\r\n_ 1759.]\r\n\r\nLévis, on his part, wrote: \"The condition in which I found\r\nthe army, bereft of everything, did not discourage me, because\r\nM. de Vaudreuil told me that Quebec was not taken, and that he had\r\nleft there a sufficiently numerous garrison; I therefore resolved,\r\nin order to repair the fault that had been committed, to engage\r\nM. de Vaudreuil to march the army back to the relief of the place.\r\nI represented to him that this was the only way to prevent the complete\r\ndefection of the Canadians and Indians; that our knowledge of the country\r\nwould enable us to approach very near the enemy, whom we\r\nknew to be intrenching themselves on the heights of Quebec\r\nand constructing batteries to breach the walls; that if we\r\nfound their army ill posted, we could attack them, or, at any\r\nrate, could prolong the siege by throwing men and supplies\r\ninto the town; and that if we could not save it, we could\r\nevacuate and burn it, so that the enemy could not possibly\r\nwinter there.\"[803]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 803: _Lévis au Ministre, 10 Nov_. 1759.]\r\n\r\nLévis quickly made his presence felt in the military chaos\r\nabout him. Bigot bestirred himself with his usual vigor to collect\r\nprovisions; and before the next morning all was ready.[804]\r\nBougainville had taken no part in the retreat, but sturdily\r\nheld his ground at Cap-Rouge while the fugitive mob swept\r\nby him. A hundred of the mounted Canadians who formed part of his\r\ncommand were now sent to Quebec, each with a bag of biscuit across\r\nhis saddle. They were to circle round to the Beauport side, where\r\nthere was no enemy, and whence they could cross the St. Charles in\r\ncanoes to the town. Bougainville followed close with a larger supply.\r\nVaudreuil sent Ramesay a message, revoking his order to surrender if\r\nthreatened with assault, telling him to hold out to the last, and\r\nassuring him that the whole army was coming to his relief.\r\nLévis hastened to be gone; but first he found time to write a\r\nfew lines to Bourlamaque. \"We have had a very great loss,\r\nfor we have lost M. de Montcalm. I regret him as my general\r\nand my friend. I found our army here. It is now on the march to\r\nretrieve our fortunes. I can trust you to hold your position; as I\r\nhave not M. de Montcalm's talents, I look to you to second me and\r\nadvise me. Put a good face on it. Hide this business as long as you\r\ncan. I am mounting my horse this moment. Write me all the news.\"[805]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 804: _Livre d'Ordres, Ordre du 17-18 Sept_. 1759.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 805: _Lévis a Bourlamaque, 18 Sept_. 1759.]\r\n\r\nThe army marched that morning, the eighteenth. In the\r\nevening it reached St. Augustin; and here it was stopped by\r\nthe chilling news that Quebec had surrendered. Utter confusion had\r\nreigned in the disheartened garrison. Men deserted hourly, some to\r\nthe country, and some to the English camp; while Townshend pushed\r\nhis trenches nearer and nearer to the walls, in spite of the cannonade\r\nwith which Piedmont and his artillerymen tried to check them. On the\r\nevening of the seventeenth, the English ships of war moved\r\ntowards the Lower Town, and a column of troops was seen\r\napproaching over the meadows of the St. Charles, as if to\r\nstorm the Palace Gate. The drums beat the alarm; but the\r\nmilitia refused to fight. Their officers came to Ramesay in\r\na body; declared that they had no mind to sustain an assault;\r\nthat they knew he had orders against it; that they would carry\r\ntheir guns back to the arsenal; that they were no longer\r\nsoldiers, but citizens; that if the army had not abandoned\r\nthem they would fight with as much spirit as ever; but that\r\nthey would not get themselves killed to no purpose. The town-major,\r\nJoannès, in a rage, beat two of them with the flat of his sword.\r\n\r\nThe white flag was raised; Joannès pulled it down, thinking,\r\nor pretending to think, that it was raised without authority;\r\nbut Ramesay presently ordered him to go to the English camp and\r\nget what terms he could. He went, through driving rain, to the\r\nquarters of Townshend, and, in hope of the promised succor, spun\r\nout the negotiation to the utmost, pretended that he had no power\r\nto yield certain points demanded, and was at last sent back to confer\r\nwith Ramesay, under a promise from the English commander that, if Quebec\r\nwere not given up before eleven o'clock, he would take it by\r\nstorm. On this Ramesay signed the articles, and Joannes\r\ncarried them back within the time prescribed. Scarcely had\r\nhe left the town, when the Canadian horsemen appeared with\r\ntheir sacks of biscuit and a renewed assurance that help was\r\nnear; but it was too late. Ramesay had surrendered, and\r\nwould not break his word. He dreaded an assault, which he\r\nknew he could not withstand, and he but half believed in the\r\npromised succor. \"How could I trust it\"? he asks. \"The army\r\nhad not dared to face the enemy before he had fortified himself;\r\nand could I hope that it would come to attack him in an intrenched\r\ncamp, defended by a formidable artillery?\" Whatever may be thought\r\nof his conduct, it was to Vaudreuil, and not to him, that the loss\r\nof Quebec was due.\r\n\r\nThe conditions granted were favorable, for Townshend\r\nknew the danger of his position, and was glad to have Quebec\r\non any terms. The troops and sailors of the garrison were\r\nto march out of the place with the honors of war, and to be\r\ncarried to France. The inhabitants were to have protection\r\nin person and property, and free exercise of religion.[806]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 806: _Articles de Capitulation, 18 Sept_. 1759.]\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon a company of artillerymen with a field-piece\r\nentered the town, and marched to the place of arms, followed by a\r\nbody of infantry. Detachments took post at all the gates. The\r\nBritish flag was raised on the heights near the top of Mountain\r\nStreet, and the capital of New France passed into the hands of its\r\nhereditary foes. The question remained, should they keep, or destroy\r\nit? It was resolved to keep it at every risk. The marines, the\r\ngrenadiers from Louisbourg, and some of the rangers were to reimbark\r\nin the fleet; while the ten battalions, with the artillery and one company\r\nof rangers, were to remain behind, bide the Canadian winter,\r\nand defend the ruins of Quebec against the efforts of Lévis.\r\nMonckton, the oldest brigadier, was disabled by his wound,\r\nand could not stay; while Townshend returned home, to parade his laurels\r\nand claim more than his share of the honors of victory.[807] The command,\r\ntherefore, rested with Murray.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 807: _Letter to an Honourable Brigadier-General_ [Townshend],\r\nprinted in 1760. A _Refutation_ soon after appeared, angry, but\r\nnot conclusive. Other replies will be found in the _Imperial Magazine\r\n_for 1760.]\r\n\r\nThe troops were not idle. Levelling their own field-works,\r\nrepairing the defences of the town, storing provisions sent\r\nashore from the fleet, making fascines, and cutting firewood,\r\nbusied them through the autumn days bright with sunshine,\r\nor dark and chill with premonition of the bitter months to\r\ncome. Admiral Saunders put off his departure longer than he\r\nhad once thought possible; and it was past the middle of\r\nOctober when he fired a parting salute, and sailed down the\r\nriver with his fleet. In it was the ship \"Royal William,\" carrying\r\nthe embalmed remains of Wolfe.\r\n\r\nMontcalm lay in his soldier's grave before the humble\r\naltar of the Ursulines, never more to see the home for which\r\nhe yearned, the wife, mother, and children whom he loved,\r\nthe olive-trees and chestnut-groves of his beloved Candiac.\r\nHe slept in peace among triumphant enemies, who respected\r\nhis memory, though they hardly knew his resting-place. It\r\nwas left for a fellow-countryman--a colleague and a brother-in-arms--to\r\nbelittle his achievements and blacken his name. The jealous spite\r\nof Vaudreuil pursued him even in death. Leaving Lévis to command\r\nat Jacques-Cartier, whither the army had again withdrawn, the\r\nGovernor retired to Montreal, whence he wrote a series of despatches\r\nto justify himself at the expense of others, and above all of the\r\nslain general, against whom his accusations were never so bitter as now,\r\nwhen the lips were cold that could have answered them. First,\r\nhe threw on Ramesay all the blame of the surrender of Quebec. Then\r\nhe addressed himself to his chief task, the defamation of his unconscious\r\nrival. \"The letter that you wrote in cipher, on the tenth of February,\r\nto Monsieur the Marquis of Montcalm and me, in common,[808] flattered his\r\nself-love to such a degree that, far from seeking conciliation,\r\nhe did nothing but try to persuade the public that his authority\r\nsurpassed mine. From the moment of Monsieur de Montcalm's arrival in this\r\ncolony, down to that of his death, he did not cease to sacrifice everything\r\nto his boundless ambition. He sowed dissension among the troops, tolerated\r\nthe most indecent talk against the government, attached to himself\r\nthe most disreputable persons, used means to corrupt the\r\nmost virtuous, and, when he could not succeed, became their\r\ncruel enemy. He wanted to be Governor-General. He privately\r\nflattered with favors and promises of patronage every officer of the\r\ncolony troops who adopted his ideas. He spared no pains to gain over\r\nthe people of whatever calling, and persuade them of his attachment;\r\nwhile, either by himself or by means of the troops of the line, he\r\nmade them bear the most frightful yoke _(le joug le plus affreux)._\r\nHe defamed honest people, encouraged insubordination, and closed his\r\neyes to the rapine of his soldiers.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 808: See _Supra_, p. 462.]\r\n\r\nThis letter was written to Vaudreuil's official superior and\r\nconfidant, the Minister of the Marine and Colonies. In another\r\nletter, written about the same time to the Minister of War, who held\r\nsimilar relations to his rival, he declares that he \"greatly regretted\r\nMonsieur de Montcalm.\"[809]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 809: _Vaudreuil au Ministre de la Guerre, 1 Nov_. 1759.]\r\n\r\nHis charges are strange ones from a man who was by turns\r\nthe patron, advocate, and tool of the official villains who\r\ncheated the King and plundered the people. Bigot, Cadet, and\r\nthe rest of the harpies that preyed on Canada looked to Vaudreuil\r\nfor support, and found it. It was but three or four weeks since he\r\nhad written to the Court in high eulogy of Bigot and effusive praise\r\nof Cadet, coupled with the request that a patent of nobility should\r\nbe given to that notorious public thief.[810] The corruptions which\r\ndisgraced his government were rife, not only in the civil\r\nadministration, but also among the officers of the colony troops,\r\nover whom he had complete control. They did not, as has been seen\r\nalready, extend to the officers of the line, who were outside the circle\r\nof peculation. It was these who were the habitual associates\r\nof Montcalm; and when Vaudreuil charges him with \"attaching\r\nto himself the most disreputable persons, and using means\r\nto corrupt the most virtuous,\" the true interpretation of his\r\nwords is that the former were disreputable because they disliked\r\nhim (the Governor), and the latter virtuous because they were his\r\npartisans.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 810: See _Supra_, p. 374.]\r\n\r\nVaudreuil continues thus: \"I am in despair, Monseigneur,\r\nto be under the necessity of painting you such a portrait after\r\ndeath of Monsieur the Marquis of Montcalm. Though it contains\r\nthe exact truth, I would have deferred it if his personal\r\nhatred to me were alone to be considered; but I feel too\r\ndeeply the loss of the colony to hide from you the cause of\r\nit. I can assure you that if I had been the sole master, Quebec\r\nwould still belong to the King, and that nothing is so disadvantageous\r\nin a colony as a division of authority and the mingling of troops\r\nof the line with marine _[colony]_ troops. Thoroughly knowing\r\nMonsieur de Montcalm, I did not doubt in the least that unless I\r\ncondescended to all his wishes, he would succeed in ruining Canada\r\nand wrecking all my plans.\"\r\n\r\nHe then charges the dead man with losing the battle of\r\nQuebec by attacking before he, the Governor, arrived to take\r\ncommand; and this, he says, was due to Montcalm's absolute\r\ndetermination to exercise independent authority, without\r\ncaring whether the colony was saved or lost. \"I cannot hide\r\nfrom you, Monseigneur, that if he had had his way in past\r\nyears Oswego and Fort George _[William Henry]_ would never\r\nhave been attacked or taken; and he owed the success at Ticonderoga\r\nto the orders I had given him.\"[811] Montcalm, on the other hand,\r\ndeclared at the time that Vaudreuil had ordered him not to risk a\r\nbattle, and that it was only through his disobedience that\r\nTiconderoga was saved.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 811: _Vaudreuil au Ministre de la Marine,_ 30 _Oct. 1759._]\r\n\r\nTen days later Vaudreuil wrote again: \"I have already had\r\nthe honor, by my letter written in cipher on the thirteenth of\r\nlast month, to give you a sketch of the character of Monsieur\r\nthe Marquis of Montcalm; but I have just been informed of\r\na stroke so black that I think, Monseigneur, that I should\r\nfail in my duty to you if I did not tell you of it.\" He goes\r\non to say that, a little before his death, and \"no doubt in\r\nfear of the fate that befell him,\" Montcalm placed in the\r\nhands of Father Roubaud, missionary at St. Francis, two\r\npackets of papers containing remarks on the administration\r\nof the colony, and especially on the manner in which the\r\nmilitary posts were furnished with supplies; that these observations\r\nwere accompanied by certificates; and that they involved\r\ncharges against him, the Governor, of complicity inpeculation.\r\nRoubaud, he continues, was to send these papersto France; \"but now,\r\nMonseigneur, that you are informed about them, I feel no anxiety,\r\nand I am sure that the King will receive no impression from them\r\nwithout acquainting himself with their truth or falsity.\"\r\n\r\nVaudreuil's anxiety was natural; and so was the action of\r\nMontcalm in making known to the Court the outrageous abuses that\r\nthreatened the King's service with ruin. His doing so was necessary\r\nboth for his own justification and for the public good; and afterwards,\r\nwhen Vaudreuil and others were brought to trial at Paris, and when\r\none of the counselfor the defence charged the late general with\r\nslanderously accusing his clients, the Court ordered the charge to\r\nbe struck from the record.[812] The papers the existence of which, if they\r\ndid exist, so terrified Vaudreuil, have thus far escaped research.\r\nBut the correspondence of the two rivals with the chiefs of the\r\ndepartments on which they severally depended is in large measure\r\npreserved; and while that of the Governor is filled with defamation\r\nof Montcalm and praise of himself, that of the General is neither\r\negotistic nor abusive. The faults of Montcalm have sufficiently appeared.\r\nThey were those of an impetuous, excitable, and impatient nature, by\r\nno means free from either ambition or vanity; but they were\r\nnever inconsistent with the character of a man of honor. His\r\nimpulsive utterances, reported by retainers and sycophants,\r\nkept Vaudreuil in a state of chronic rage; and, void as he\r\nwas of all magnanimity, gnawed with undying jealousy, and\r\nmortally in dread of being compromised by the knaveries to\r\nwhich he had lent his countenance, he could not contain\r\nhimself within the bounds of decency or sense. In another\r\nletter he had the baseness to say that Montcalm met his death\r\nin trying to escape from the English.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 812: _Procès de Bigot, Cadet, et autres._]\r\n\r\nAmong the Governor's charges are some which cannot be\r\nflatly denied. When he accuses his rival of haste and precipitation\r\nin attacking the English army, he touches a fair subject\r\nof criticism; but, as a whole, he is as false in his detraction\r\nof Montcalm as in his praises of Bigot and Cadet.\r\n\r\nThe letter which Wolfe sent to Pitt a few days before his\r\ndeath, written in what may be called a spirit of resolute\r\ndespair, and representing success as almost hopeless, filled\r\nEngland with a dejection that found utterance in loud grumblings\r\nagainst the Ministry. Horace Walpole wrote the bad news to his friend\r\nMann, ambassador at Florence: \"Two days ago came letters from Wolfe,\r\ndespairing as much as heroes can despair. Quebec is well victualled,\r\nAmherst is not arrived, and fifteen thousand men are encamped to defend\r\nit. We have lost many men by the enemy, and some by our\r\nfriends; that is, we now call our nine thousand only seven\r\nthousand. How this little army will get away from a much\r\nlarger, and in this season, in that country, I don't guess: yes,\r\nI do.\"\r\n\r\nHardly were these lines written when tidings came that\r\nMontcalm was defeated, Quebec taken, and Wolfe killed. A\r\nflood of mixed emotions swept over England. Even Walpole\r\ngrew half serious as he sent a packet of newspapers to his\r\nfriend the ambassador. \"You may now give yourself what airs you please.\r\nAn ambassador is the only man in the world whom bullying becomes.\r\nAll precedents are on your side: Persians, Greeks, Romans, always\r\ninsulted their neighbors when they took Quebec. Think how pert the\r\nFrench would have been on such an occasion! What a scene! An army in\r\nthe night dragging itself up a precipice by stumps of trees\r\nto assault a town and attack an enemy strongly intrenched\r\nand double in numbers! The King is overwhelmed with addresses\r\non our victories; he will have enough to paper his palace.\"[813]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 813: _Letters of Horace Walpole_, III. 254, 257 (ed. Cunningham\r\n1857).]\r\n\r\nWhen, in soberer mood, he wrote the annals of his time,\r\nand turned, not for the better, from the epistolary style to\r\nthe historical, he thus described the impression made on the\r\nEnglish public by the touching and inspiring story of Wolfe's\r\nheroism and death: \"The incidents of dramatic fiction could\r\nnot be conducted with more address to lead an audience from\r\ndespondency to sudden exaltation than accident prepared to\r\nexcite the passions of a whole people. They despaired, they\r\ntriumphed, and they wept; for Wolfe had fallen in the hour\r\nof victory. Joy, curiosity, astonishment, was painted on every\r\ncountenance. The more they inquired, the more their admiration\r\nrose. Not an incident but was heroic and affecting.\"[814]\r\nEngland blazed with bonfires. In one spot alone all was dark and\r\nsilent; for here a widowed mother mourned for a loving and devoted\r\nson, and the people forbore to profane her grief with the clamor\r\nof their rejoicings.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 814: Walpole, _Memoirs of George II._, II. 384.]\r\n\r\nNew England had still more cause of joy than Old, and\r\nshe filled the land with jubilation. The pulpits resounded with\r\nsermons of thanksgiving, some of which were worthy of the\r\noccasion that called them forth. Among the rest, Jonathan\r\nMayhew, a young but justly celebrated minister of Boston,\r\npictured with enthusiasm the future greatness of the British-American\r\ncolonies, with the continent thrown open before them, and foretold that,\r\n\"with the continued blessing of Heaven, they will become, in another\r\ncentury or two, a mighty empire;\" adding in cautious parenthesis,\r\n\"_I do not mean an independent one_.\" He read Wolfe's victory aright,\r\nand divined its far-reaching consequence.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The authorities of this chapter are, in the main, the\r\nsame as those of the preceding, with some additions, the principal\r\nof which is the _Mémoire du Sieur de Ramezay, Chevalier de\r\nl'Ordre royal et militaire de St.-Louis, cy-devant Lieutenant pour\r\nle Roy commandant à Québec, au sujet de la Reddition de cette\r\nVille, qui a été suivie de la Capitulation du 18 7bre 1759_ (Archives\r\nde la Marine). To this document are appended a number of important\r\n\"pièces justificatives.\" These, with the _Mémoire_, have been\r\nprinted by the Quebec Historical Society. The letters of Vaudreuil\r\ncited in this chapter are chiefly from the Archives Nationales.\r\n\r\nIf Montcalm, as Vaudreuil says, really intrusted papers to the\r\ncare of the Jesuit missionary Roubaud, he was not fortunate in\r\nhis choice of a depositary. After the war Roubaud renounced his\r\nOrder, adjured his faith, and went over to the English. He gave\r\nvarious and contradictory accounts of the documents said to be\r\nin his hands. On one occasion he declared that Montcalm's effects\r\nleft with him at his mission of St. Francis had been burned to\r\nprevent their falling into the hands of the enemy (see Verreau,\r\n_Report on Canadian Archives_, 1874, p. 183). Again, he says that\r\nhe had placed in the hands of the King of England certain letters\r\nof Montcalm (see _Mr. Roubaud's Deplorable Case, humbly submitted\r\nto Lord North's Consideration_, in _Historical Magazine_,\r\nSecond Series, VIII. 283). Yet again, he speaks of these same\r\nletters as \"pretended\" (Verreau, _as above_). He complains that\r\nsome of them had been published, without his consent, \"by a\r\nLord belonging to His Majesty's household\" (_Mr. Roubaud's\r\nDeplorable Case_).\r\n\r\nThe allusion here is evidently to a pamphlet printed in London,\r\nin 1777, in French and English, and entitled, _Lettres de Monsieur\r\nle Marquis de Montcalm, Gouverneur-Général en Canada, à\r\nMessieurs de Berryer et de la Molé, écrites dans les Années 1757,\r\n1758, et 1759, avec une Version Angloise_. They profess to be\r\nobservations by Montcalm on the English colonies, their political\r\ncharacter, their trade, and their tendency to independence. They\r\nbear the strongest marks of being fabricated to suit the times,\r\nthe colonies being then in revolt. The principal letter is one\r\naddressed to Molé, and bearing date Quebec, Aug. 24, 1759. It\r\nforetells the loss of her colonies as a consequence to England\r\nof her probable conquest of Canada. I laid before the Massachusetts\r\nHistorical Society my reasons for believing this letter, like\r\nthe rest, an imposture (see the _Proceedings_ of that Society for\r\n1869-1870, pp. 112-128). To these reasons it may be added that\r\nat the date assigned to the letter all correspondence was stopped\r\nbetween Canada and France. From the arrival of the English fleet,\r\nat the end of spring, till its departure, late in autumn, communication\r\nwas completely cut off. It was not till towards the end of\r\nNovember, when the river was clear of English ships, that the\r\nnaval commander Kanon ran by the batteries of Quebec and\r\ncarried to France the first news from Canada. Some of the letters\r\nthus sent were dated a month before, and had waited in Canada\r\ntill Kanon's departure.\r\n\r\nAbbé Verreau--a high authority on questions of Canadian history--tells\r\nme a comparison of the handwriting has convinced him that these pretended\r\nletters of Montcalm are the work of Roubaud.\r\n\r\nOn the burial of Montcalm, see Appendix J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 29\r\n\r\n1759, 1760\r\n\r\nSainte-Foy\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fleet was gone; the great river was left a solitude; and\r\nthe chill days of a fitful November passed over Quebec in\r\nalternations of rain and frost, sunshine and snow. The troops,\r\ndriven by cold from their encampment on the Plains, were all\r\ngathered within the walls. Their own artillery had so battered\r\nthe place that it was not easy to find shelter. The Lower Town\r\nwas a wilderness of scorched and crumbling walls. As you\r\nascend Mountain Street, the Bishop's Palace, on the right, was\r\na skeleton of tottering masonry, and the buildings on the left\r\nwere a mass of ruin, where ragged boys were playing at seesaw\r\namong the fallen planks and timbers.[815] Even in the Upper\r\nTown few of the churches and public buildings had escaped.\r\nThe Cathedral was burned to a shell. The solid front of the\r\nCollege of the Jesuits was pockmarked by numberless cannon-balls,\r\nand the adjacent church of the Order was wofully shattered.\r\nThe church of the Recollects suffered still more. The bombshells\r\nthat fell through the roof had broken into the pavement, and as\r\nthey burst had thrown up the bones and skulls of the dead from\r\nthe graves beneath.[816] Even the more distant Hôtel-Dieu was\r\npierced by fifteen projectiles, some of which had exploded in the\r\nhalls and chambers.[817]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 815: Drawings made on the spot by Richard Short. These drawings,\r\ntwelve in number, were engraved and published in 1761.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 816: Short's _Views in Quebec_, 1759. Compare Pontbriand,\r\nin _N.Y. Col. Docs._, X. 1,057.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 817: Casgrain, _Hôtel-Dieu de Québec_, 445.]\r\n\r\nThe Commissary-General, Berniers, thus describes to\r\nBourlamaque the state of the town: \"Quebec is nothing but\r\na shapeless mass of ruins. Confusion, disorder, pillage reign\r\neven among the inhabitants, for the English make examples of\r\nseverity every day. Everybody rushes hither and thither, without\r\nknowing why. Each searches for his possessions, and, not\r\nfinding his own, seizes those of other people. English and\r\nFrench, all is chaos alike. The inhabitants, famished and\r\ndestitute, escape to the country. Never was there seen such a\r\nsight.\"[818]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 818: _Berniers à Bourlamaque, 27 Sept. 1759_.]\r\n\r\nQuebec swarmed with troops. There were guardhouses at\r\ntwenty different points; sentinels paced the ramparts, squads\r\nof men went the rounds, soldiers off duty strolled the streets,\r\nsome in mitre caps and some black three-cornered hats; while\r\na ceaseless rolling of drums and a rigid observance of military\r\nforms betrayed the sense of a still imminent danger. While\r\nsome of the inhabitants left town, others remained, having no\r\nrefuge elsewhere. They were civil to the victors, but severe\r\ntowards their late ruler. \"The citizens,\" says Knox, \"particularly\r\nthe females, reproach M. Vaudreuil upon every occasion,\r\nand give full scope to bitter invectives.\" He praises the agreeable\r\nmanners and cheerful spirit of the Canadian ladies, concerning\r\nwhom another officer also writes: \"It is very surprising\r\nwith what ease the gayety of their tempers enables them to\r\nbear misfortunes which to us would be insupportable. Families\r\nwhom the calamities of war have reduced from the height of\r\nluxury to the want of common necessaries laugh, dance, and\r\nsing, comforting themselves with this reflection--_Fortune de\r\nguerre_. Their young ladies take the utmost pains to teach our\r\nofficers French; with what view I know not, if it is not that\r\nthey may hear themselves praised, flattered, and courted without\r\nloss of time.\"[819]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 819: _Alexander Campbell to John Floyd, 22 Oct. 1759_. Campbell\r\nwas a lieutenant of the Highlanders; Lloyd was a Connecticut\r\nmerchant.]\r\n\r\nKnox was quartered in a small stable, with a hayloft above\r\nand a rack and manger at one end: a lodging better than fell\r\nto the lot of many of his brother officers; and, by means of a\r\nstove and some help from a carpenter, he says that he made\r\nhimself tolerably comfortable. The change, however, was an\r\nagreeable one when he was ordered for a week to the General\r\nHospital, a mile out of the town, where he was to command\r\nthe guard stationed to protect the inmates and watch the\r\nenemy. Here were gathered the sick and wounded of both armies,\r\nnursed with equal care by the nuns, of whom Knox speaks with gratitude\r\nand respect. \"When our poor fellows were ill and ordered to be removed\r\nfrom their odious regimental hospital to this general receptacle, they\r\nwere indeed rendered inexpressibly happy. Each patient has his bed, with\r\ncurtains, allotted to him, and a nurse to attend him. Every sick\r\nor wounded officer has an apartment to himself, and is attended\r\nby one of these religious sisters, who in general are young,\r\nhandsome, courteous, rigidly reserved, and very respectful.\r\nTheir office of nursing the sick furnishes them with opportunities\r\nof taking great latitudes if they are so disposed; but I\r\nnever heard any of them charged with the least levity.\" The\r\nnuns, on their part, were well pleased with the conduct of\r\ntheir new masters, whom one of them describes as the \"most\r\nmoderate of all conquerors.\"\r\n\r\n\"I lived here,\" Knox continues, \"at the French King's table,\r\nwith an agreeable, polite society of officers, directors, and commissaries.\r\nSome of the gentlemen were married, and their ladies honored us with their\r\ncompany. They were generally cheerful, except when we discoursed on\r\nthe late revolution and the affairs of the campaign; then they seemingly\r\ngave way to grief, uttered by profound sighs, followed by an _O mon\r\nDieu!_\" He walked in the garden with the French officers,\r\nplayed at cards with them, and passed the time so pleasantly\r\nthat his short stay at the hospital seemed an oasis in his hard\r\nlife of camp and garrison.\r\n\r\nMère de Sainte-Claude, the Superior, a sister of Ramesay,\r\nlate commandant of Quebec, one morning sent him a note of\r\ninvitation to what she called an English breakfast; and though\r\nthe repast answered to nothing within his experience, he says\r\nthat he \"fared exceedingly well, and passed near two hours\r\nmost agreeably in the society of this ancient lady and her\r\nvirgin sisters.\"\r\n\r\nThe excellent nuns of the General Hospital are to-day what\r\ntheir predecessors were, and the scene of their useful labors\r\nstill answers at many points to that described by the careful\r\npen of their military guest. Throughout the war they and the\r\nnuns of the Hôtel-Dieu had been above praise in their assiduous\r\ndevotion to the sick and wounded.\r\n\r\nBrigadier Murray, now in command of Quebec, was a gallant\r\nsoldier, upright, humane, generous, eager for distinction,\r\nand more daring than prudent. He befriended the Canadians,\r\nissued strict orders against harming them in person or property,\r\nhanged a soldier who had robbed a citizen of Quebec, and\r\nseverely punished others for slighter offences of the same sort.\r\nIn general the soldiers themselves showed kindness towards the\r\nconquered people; during harvest they were seen helping them\r\nto reap their fields, without compensation, and sharing with\r\nthem their tobacco and rations. The inhabitants were disarmed,\r\nand required to take the oath of allegiance. Murray reported\r\nin the spring that the whole country, from Cap-Rouge downward,\r\nwas in subjection to the British Crown.[820]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 820: _Murray to Pitt, 25 May, 1760_. Murray, _Journal,\r\n1759, 1760_.]\r\n\r\nLate in October it was rumored that some of the French\r\nships in the river above Quebec were preparing to run by the\r\nbatteries. This was the squadron which had arrived in the\r\nspring with supplies, and had lain all summer at Batiscan, in\r\nthe Richelieu, and at other points beyond reach of the English.\r\nAfter nearly a month of expectancy, they at length appeared,\r\nanchored off Sillery on the twenty-first of November, and tried\r\nto pass the town on the dark night of the twenty-fourth. Seven\r\nor eight of them succeeded; four others ran aground and were\r\nset on fire by their crews, excepting one which was stranded\r\non the south shore and abandoned. Captain Miller, with a lieutenant\r\nand above forty men, boarded her; when, apparently through their\r\nown carelessness, she blew up.[821] Most of the party were killed\r\nby the explosion, and the rest, including the two officers, were\r\nleft in a horrible condition between life and death. Thus they\r\nremained till a Canadian, venturing on board in search of plunder,\r\nfound them, called his neighbors to his aid, carried them to his\r\nown house, and after applying, with the utmost kindness, what simple\r\nremedies he knew, went over to Quebec and told of the disaster.\r\nFortunately for themselves, the sufferers soon died.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 821: _Murray to Amherst, 25 Jan. 1760_. Not, as some believed, by\r\na train laid by the French.]\r\n\r\nDecember came, and brought the Canadian winter, with\r\nits fierce light and cold, glaring snowfields, and piercing blasts\r\nthat scorch the cheek like a firebrand. The men were frost-bitten\r\nas they dug away the dry, powdery drifts that the wind had piled\r\nagainst the rampart. The sentries were relieved every hour; yet feet\r\nand fingers were continually frozen. The clothing of the troops was\r\nill-suited to the climate, and, though stoves had been placed in the\r\nguard and barrack rooms, the supply of fuel constantly fell short.\r\nThe cutting and dragging of wood was the chief task of the garrison\r\nfor many weeks. Parties of axemen, strongly guarded, were always at work in\r\nthe forest of Ste.-Foy, four or five miles from Quebec, and the\r\nlogs were brought to town on sledges dragged by the soldiers.\r\nEight of them were harnessed in pairs to each sledge; and as\r\nthere was always danger from Indians and bushrangers, every\r\nman carried his musket slung at his back. The labor was prodigious;\r\nfor frequent snowstorms made it necessary again and again to beat a\r\nfresh track through the drifts. The men bore their hardships with\r\nadmirable good humor; and once a party of them on their return, dragging\r\ntheir load through the street, met a Canadian, also with a load of wood,\r\nwhich was drawn by a team of dogs harnessed much like themselves. They\r\naccosted them as yoke-fellows, comrades, and brothers; asked\r\nthem what allowance of pork and rum they got; and invited\r\nthem and their owner to mess at the regimental barracks.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the troops on duty within the town, as\r\ndescribed by Knox, was scarcely less eccentric. \"Our guards\r\non the grand parade make a most grotesque appearance in\r\ntheir different dresses; and our inventions to guard us against\r\nthe extreme rigor of this climate are various beyond imagination.\r\nThe uniformity as well as nicety of the clean, methodical\r\nsoldier is buried in the rough, fur-wrought garb of the frozen\r\nLaplander; and we rather resemble a masquerade than a body\r\nof regular troops, insomuch that I have frequently been accosted\r\nby my acquaintances, whom, though their voices were familiar to me,\r\nI could not discover, or conceive who they were. Besides, every man\r\nseems to be in a continual hurry; for instead of walking soberly\r\nthrough the streets, we are obliged to observe a running or trotting pace.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in January there was a storm of sleet, followed by\r\nsevere frost, which glazed the streets with ice. Knox, being\r\nordered to mount guard in the Lower Town, found the descent\r\nof Mountain Street so slippery that it was impossible to walk\r\ndown with safety, especially as the muskets of the men were\r\nloaded; and the whole party, seating themselves on the ground,\r\nslid one after another to the foot of the hill. The Highlanders,\r\nin spite of their natural hardihood, suffered more from the cold\r\nthan the other troops, as their national costume was but a\r\nsorry defence against the Canadian winter. A detachment of\r\nthese breechless warriors being on guard at the General\r\nHospital, the nuns spent their scanty leisure in knitting for\r\nthem long woollen hose, which they gratefully accepted, though\r\nat a loss to know whether modesty or charity inspired the gift.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when the English took possession of Quebec,\r\nreports had come in through deserters that Lévis meant to attack\r\nand recover it. Early in November there was a rumor that he was about\r\nto march upon it with fifteen thousand men. In December word came\r\nthat he was on his way, resolved to storm it on or about the twenty-second,\r\nand dine within the walls, under the French flag, on Christmas Day.\r\nHe failed to appear; but in January a deserter said that he had prepared\r\nscaling-ladders, and was training his men to use them by assaults\r\non mock ramparts of snow. There was more tangible evidence\r\nthat the enemy was astir. Murray had established two fortified outposts,\r\none at Ste.-Foy, and the other farther on, at Old Lorette. War-parties\r\nhovered round both, and kept the occupants in alarm. A large body of\r\nFrench grenadiers appearedat the latter place in February, and drove\r\noff a herd of cattle; when a detachment of rangers, much inferior in\r\nnumber, set upon them, put them to flight, and recovered the plunder.\r\nAt the same time a party of regulars, Canadians, andIndians took up a\r\nstrong position near the church at Point Levi, and sent a message to the\r\nEnglish officers that a large company of expert hairdressers were ready\r\nto wait upon them whenever they required their services. The allusion\r\nwas of course to the scalp-lifting practices of the Indians and\r\nbushrangers.\r\n\r\nThe river being now hard frozen, Murray sent over a detachment\r\nof light infantry under Major Dalling. A sharp fight ensued on the snow,\r\naround the church, and in the neighboringforest, where the English\r\nsoldiers, taught to use snow-shoes by the rangers, routed the enemy, and\r\nkilled or captured a considerable number. A third post was then established\r\nat the church and the priest's house adjacent. Some days after, the\r\nFrench came back in large numbers, fortified themselves with\r\nfelled trees, and then attacked the English position. The firing\r\nbeing heard at Quebec, the light infantry went over to the\r\nscene of action, and Murray himself followed on the ice, with\r\nthe Highlanders and other troops. Before he came up, the\r\nFrench drew off and retreated to their breastwork, where they\r\nwere attacked and put to flight, the nimble Highlanders capturing\r\na few, while the greater part made their escape.\r\n\r\nAs it became known that the French held a strong post at\r\nLe Calvaire, near St. Augustin, two days' march from Quebec,\r\nCaptain Donald MacDonald was sent with five hundred men\r\nto attack it. He found the enemy behind a breastwork of logs\r\nprotected by an abattis. The light infantry advanced and\r\npoured in a brisk fire; on which the French threw down their\r\narms and fled. About eighty of them were captured; but their\r\ncommander, Herbin, escaped, leaving to the victors his watch,\r\nhat and feather, wine, liquor-case, and mistress. The English\r\nhad six men wounded and nearly a hundred frost-bitten.[822]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 822: Knox, II. 275. Murray, _Journal_. Fraser, _Journal_.\r\nVaudreuil, in his usual way, multiplies the English force by three.]\r\n\r\nCaptain Hazen and his rangers soon after had a notable\r\nskirmish. They were posted in a house not far from the station\r\nat Lorette. A scout came in with news that a large party of\r\nthe enemy was coming to attack them; on which Hazen left a\r\nsergeant and fourteen men in the house, and set out for Lorette\r\nwith the rest to ask a reinforcement. On the way he met the\r\nFrench, who tried to surround him; and he told his men to\r\nfall back to the house. They remonstrated, saying that they\r\n\"felt spry,\" and wanted to show the regulars that provincials\r\ncould fight as well as red-coats. Thereupon they charged the\r\nenemy, gave them a close volley of buckshot and bullets, and\r\nput them to flight; but scarcely had they reloaded their guns\r\nwhen they were fired upon from behind. Another body of assailants had\r\ngot into their rear, in order to cut them off. Theyfaced about,\r\nattacked them, and drove them back like the first. The two French\r\nparties then joined forces, left Hazen topursue his march, and\r\nattacked the fourteen rangers in the house, who met them with a\r\nbrisk fire. Hazen and his men heard the noise; and, hastening back,\r\nfell upon the rear of the French, while those in the house sallied\r\nand attacked them infront. They were again routed; and the rangers\r\nchased them two miles, killing six of them and capturing seven. Knox,\r\nin whose eyes provincials usually find no favor, launches this\r\ntime into warm commendation of \"our simply honest New England men.\"\r\n\r\nFresh reports came in from time to time that the French\r\nwere gathering all their strength to recover Quebec; and late\r\nin February these stories took a definite shape. A deserter from\r\nMontreal brought Murray a letter from an officer of rangers,\r\nwho was a prisoner at that place, warning him that eleven\r\nthousand men were on the point of marching to attack him.\r\nThree other deserters soon after confirmed the news, but\r\nadded that the scheme had met with a check; for as it was intended\r\nto carry the town by storm, a grand rehearsal had taken\r\nplace, with the help of scaling-ladders planted against the wall\r\nof a church; whereupon the Canadians rushed with such zeal\r\nto the assault that numerous broken legs, arms, and heads\r\nensued, along with ruptures, sprains, bruises, and dislocations;\r\ninsomuch, said the story, that they became disgusted with the\r\nattempt. All remained quiet till after the middle of April, when\r\nthe garrison was startled by repeated assurances that at the first\r\nbreaking-up of the ice all Canada would be upon them. Murray\r\naccordingly ordered the French inhabitants to leave the town\r\nwithin three days.[823]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 823: _Ordonnance faite à Québec le 21 Avril, 1760, par son\r\nExcellence, Jacques Murray_.]\r\n\r\nIn some respects the temper of the troops was excellent. In\r\nthe petty warfare of the past winter they had generally been\r\nsuccessful, proving themselves a match for the bushrangers\r\nand Indians on their own ground; so that, as Sergeant Johnson\r\nremarks, in his odd way, \"Very often a small number of our\r\nmen would put to flight a considerable party of those Cannibals.\"\r\nThey began to think themselves invincible; yet they had\r\nthe deepest cause for anxiety. The effective strength of the garrison\r\nwas reduced to less than half, and of those that remained\r\nfit for duty, hardly a man was entirely free from scurvy. The\r\nrank and file had no fresh provisions; and, in spite of every\r\nprecaution, this malignant disease, aided by fever and dysentery,\r\nmade no less havoc among them than among the crews of Jacques Cartier\r\nat this same place two centuries before. Of about seven thousand men\r\nleft at Quebec in the autumn, scarcely more than three thousand were\r\nfit for duty on the twenty-fourth of April.[824] About seven hundred\r\nhad found temporary burial in the snowdrifts, as the frozen ground was\r\nimpenetrable as a rock.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 824: _Return of the present State of His Majesty's Forces\r\nin Garrison at Quebec, 24 April, 1760_ (Public Record Office).]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Vaudreuil was still at Montreal, where he says\r\nthat he \"arrived just in time to take the most judicious measures\r\nand prevent General Amherst from penetrating into thecolony.\"[825]\r\nDuring the winter some of the French regulars were kept in garrison\r\nat the outposts, and the rest quartered on the inhabitants; while the\r\nCanadians were dismissed to theirhomes, subject to be mustered again\r\nat the call of the Governor. Both he and Lévis were full of the hope\r\nof retaking Quebec. He had spies and agents among Murray's soldiers;\r\nand though the citizens had sworn allegiance to King George,\r\nsome of them were exceedingly useful to his enemies. Vaudreuil\r\nhad constant information of the state of the garrison. He knew that\r\nthe scurvy was his active and powerful ally, and that the hospitals\r\nand houses of Quebec were crowded withthe sick. At the end of March\r\nhe was informed that more than half the British were on the sick-list;\r\nand it was presentlyrumored that Murray had only two thousand men able\r\nto bear arms.[826] With every allowance for exaggeration in these reports,\r\nit was plain that the French could attack their invaders in\r\noverwhelming force.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 825: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 30 Oct. 1759_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 826: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 15 Avril, 1760_.]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty was to find means of transportation. The depth\r\nof the snow and the want of draught animals made it necessary\r\nto wait till the river should become navigable; but preparation\r\nwas begun at once. Lévis was the soul of the enterprise. Provisions\r\nwere gathered from far and near; cannon, mortars, and munitions of\r\nwar were brought from the frontier posts, and butcher-knives were\r\nfitted to the muzzles of guns to servethe Canadians in place of\r\nbayonets. All the workmen aboutMontreal were busied in making tools\r\nand gun-carriages. Stores were impressed from the merchants; and\r\ncertain articles, which could not otherwise be had, were smuggled,\r\nwith extraordinary address, out of Quebec itself.[827] Early in\r\nspring the militia received orders to muster for the march. There\r\nwere doubts and discontent; but, says a contemporary, \"sensible\r\npeople dared not speak, for if they did they were set down as\r\nEnglish.\" Some there were who in secret called the scheme\r\n\"Lévis' folly;\" yet it was perfectly rational, well conceived,\r\nand conducted with vigor and skill. Two frigates, two sloops-of-war,\r\nand a number of smaller craft still remained in the river, under\r\ncommand of Vauquelin, the brave officer who haddistinguished himself\r\nat the siege of Louisbourg. The storesand cannon were placed on\r\nboard these vessels, the army embarkedin a fleet of bateaux, and on\r\nthe twentieth of April thewhole set out together for the scene of\r\naction. They comprised eight battalions of troops of the line and\r\ntwo of colony troops; with the colonial artillery, three thousand\r\nCanadians, and four hundred Indians. When they left Montreal, their\r\neffective strength, besides Indians, is said by Lévis to have been six\r\nthousand nine hundred and ten, a number which was increased\r\nas he advanced by the garrisons of Jacques-Cartier, Déschambault,\r\nand Pointe-aux-Trembles, as well as by the Canadians on both side\r\nof the St. Lawrence below Three Rivers; forVaudreuil had ordered\r\nthe militia captains to join his standard, with all their followers,\r\narmed and equipped, on pain of death.[828] These accessions appear\r\nto have raised his force to between eight and nine thousand.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 827: __Vaudreuil au Ministre, 23 Avril, 1760_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 828: _Vaudreuil aux Capitaines de Milice, 16 Avril, 1760_. I am\r\nindebted to Abbé H.R. Casgrain for a copy of this letter.]\r\n\r\nThe ice still clung to the river banks, the weather was bad,\r\nand the navigation difficult; but on the twenty-sixth the army\r\nlanded at St. Augustin, crossed the river of Cap-Rouge on\r\nbridges of their own making, and moved upon the English outpost\r\nat Old Lorette. The English abandoned it and fell backto Ste.-Foy.\r\nLévis followed. Night came on, with a gale from the southeast, a\r\ndriving rain, and violent thunder, unusual at that season. The road,\r\na bad and broken one, led through themarsh called La Suède. Causeways\r\nand bridges broke down under the weight of the marching columns and\r\nplunged the men into water, mud, and half-thawed ice. \"It was a\r\nfrightful night,\" says Lévis; \"so dark that but for the flashes of\r\nlightning we should have been forced to stop.\" The break of day found\r\nthe vanguard at the edge of the woods bordering the farther\r\nside of the marsh. The storm had abated; and they saw before\r\nthem, a few hundred yards distant, through the misty air, a\r\nridge of rising ground on which stood the parish church of\r\nSte.-Foy, with a row of Canadian houses stretching far to\r\nright and left. This ridge was the declivity of the plateau of\r\nQuebec; the same which as it approaches the town, some five\r\nor six miles towards the left, takes the names of Côte d'Abraham\r\nand Côte Ste.-Geneviève. The church and the houses were occupied by\r\nBritish troops, who, as the French debouchedfrom the woods, opened\r\non them with cannon, and compelledthem to fall back. Though the ridge\r\nat this point is not steep, the position was a strong one; but had\r\nLévis known how fewwere as yet there to oppose him, he might have\r\ncarried it byan assault in front. As it was, he resolved to wait\r\ntill night, and then flank the enemy by a march to the right along\r\nthe border of the wood.\r\n\r\nIt was the morning of Sunday, the twenty-seventh. Till late\r\nin the night before, Murray and the garrison of Quebec were\r\nunaware of the immediate danger; and they learned it at last\r\nthrough a singular stroke of fortune. Some time after midnight\r\nthe watch on board the frigate \"Racehorse,\" which hadwintered in\r\nthe dock at the Lower Town, heard a feeble cryof distress from the\r\nmidst of the darkness that covered the St. Lawrence. Captain Macartney\r\nwas at once informed of it; and, through an impulse of humanity,\r\nhe ordered a boat to put outamid the drifting ice that was sweeping\r\nup the river with thetide. Guided by the faint cries, the sailors\r\nfound a man lying on a large cake of ice, drenched, and half dead\r\nwith cold; and, taking him with difficulty into their boat, they\r\ncarried him to the ship. It was long before he was able to speak\r\nintelligibly; but at last, being revived by cordials and other remedies,\r\nhe found strength to tell his benefactors that he was a sergeant of\r\nartillery in the army that had come to retake Quebec; that in\r\ntrying to land a little above Cap-Rouge, his boat had been\r\noverset, his companions drowned, and he himself saved by\r\nclimbing upon the cake of ice where they had discovered him;\r\nthat he had been borne by the ebb tide down to the Island of\r\nOrleans, and then brought up to Quebec by the flow; and,\r\nfinally, that Lévis was marching on the town with twelve\r\nthousand men at his back.\r\n\r\nHe was placed in a hammock and carried up Mountain\r\nStreet to the quarters of the General, who was roused from\r\nsleep at three o'clock in the morning to hear his story. The\r\ntroops were ordered under arms; and soon after daybreak\r\nMurray marched out with ten pieces of cannon and more than\r\nhalf the garrison. His principal object was to withdraw the\r\nadvanced posts at Ste.-Foy, Cap-Rouge, Sillery, and Anse du\r\nFoulon. The storm had turned to a cold, drizzling rain, and the\r\nmen, as they dragged their cannon through snow and mud,\r\nwere soon drenched to the skin. On reaching Ste.-Foy, they\r\nopened a brisk fire from the heights upon the woods which now\r\ncovered the whole army of Lévis; and being rejoined by the\r\nvarious outposts, returned to Quebec in the afternoon, after\r\nblowing up the church, which contained a store of munitions\r\nthat they had no means of bringing off. When they entered\r\nQuebec a gill of rum was served out to each man; several\r\nhouses in the suburb of St. Roch were torn down to supply\r\nthem with firewood for drying their clothes; and they were left\r\nto take what rest they could against the morrow. The French,\r\nmeanwhile, took possession of the abandoned heights; and\r\nwhile some filled the houses, barns, and sheds of Ste.-Foy and\r\nits neighborhood, others, chiefly Canadians, crossed the\r\nplateau to seek shelter in the village of Sillery.\r\n\r\nThree courses were open to Murray. He could defend Quebec,\r\nfortify himself outside the walls on the Buttes-à-Neveu,\r\nor fight Lévis at all risks. The walls of Quebec could not withstand\r\na cannonade, and he had long intended to intrench his army on the\r\nButtes, as a better position of defence; but the ground, frozen like\r\na rock, had thus far made the plan impracticable. Even now, though\r\nhe surface was thawed, the soil beneath was still frost-bound, making\r\nthe task of fortificationextremely difficult, if indeed the French\r\nwould give him time for it. Murray was young in years, and younger\r\nstill in impulse. He was ardent, fearless, ambitious, and emulous\r\nof the fame of Wolfe. \"The enemy,\" he soon after wrote to Pitt, \"was\r\ngreatly superior in number, it is true; but when I considered\r\nthat our little army was in the habit of beating the enemy, and\r\nhad a very fine train of field artillery; that shutting ourselves\r\nat once within the walls was putting all upon the single chance\r\nof holding out for a considerable time a wretched fortification,\r\nI resolved to give them battle; and, half an hour after six in\r\nthe morning, we marched with all the force I could muster,\r\nnamely, three thousand men.\"[829] Some of these had left the\r\nhospitals of their own accord in their eagerness to take part in\r\nthe fray.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 829: _Murray to Pitt, 25 May, 1760_.]\r\n\r\nThe rain had ceased; but as the column emerged from St.\r\nLouis Gate, the scene before them was a dismal one. As yet\r\nthere was no sign of spring. Each leafless bush and tree was\r\ndark with clammy moisture; patches of bare earth lay oozy and\r\nblack on the southern slopes: but elsewhere the ground was\r\nstill covered with snow, in some places piled in drifts, and\r\neverywhere sodden with rain; while each hollow and depression\r\nwas full of that half-liquid, lead-colored mixture of snow and\r\nwater which new England schoolboys call \"slush,\" for all\r\ndrainage was stopped by the frozen subsoil. The troops had\r\nwith them two howitzers and twenty field-pieces, which had\r\nbeen captured when Quebec surrendered, and had formed a\r\npart of that very battery which Ramesay refused to Montcalm\r\nat the battle of the autumn before. As there were no horses, the\r\ncannon were dragged by some of the soldiers, while others\r\ncarried picks and spades; for as yet Murray seems not to have\r\nmade up his mind whether to fortify or fight. Thus they advanced\r\nnearly half a mile; till reaching the Buttes-à-Neveu, they formed\r\nin order of battle along their farther slopes, on thesame ground\r\nthat Montcalm had occupied on the morning of his death.\r\n\r\nMurray went forward to reconnoitre. Immediately before\r\nhim was a rising ground, and, beyond it, a tract of forest called\r\nSillery Wood, a mile or more distant. Nearer, on the left, he\r\ncould see two blockhouses built by the English in the last\r\nautumn, not far from the brink of the plateau above the Anse\r\ndu Foulon where Wolfe climbed the heights. On the right, at\r\nthe opposite brink of the plateau, was a house and a fortified\r\nwind mill belonging to one Dumont. The blockhouses, the mill,\r\nand the rising ground between them were occupied by the\r\nvanguard of Lévis' army; while, behind, he could descry the\r\nmain body moving along the road from Ste.-Foy, then turning,\r\nbattalion after battalion, and rapidly marching across the\r\nplateau along the edge of Sillery Wood. The two brigades of\r\nthe leading column had already reached the blockhouses by\r\nthe Anse du Foulon, and formed themselves as the right wing\r\nof the French line of battle; but those behind were not yet in\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nMurray, kindling at the sight, thought that so favorable a\r\nmoment was not to be lost, and ordered an advance. His line\r\nconsisted of eight battalions, numbering a little above two\r\nthousand. In the intervals between them the cannon were\r\ndragged through slush and mud by five hundred men; and, at\r\na little distance behind, the remaining two battalions followed\r\nas a reserve. The right flank was covered by Dalling's light\r\ninfantry; the left by Hazen's company of rangers and a hundred\r\nvolunteers under Major MacDonald. They all moved forward\r\ntill they were on nearly the same ground where Wolfe's army had\r\nbeen drawn up. Then the cannon unlimbered, andopened on the French\r\nwith such effect that Lévis, who was on horseback in the middle\r\nof the field, sent orders to the corpsof his left to fall back\r\nto the cover of the woods. The movement caused some disorder.\r\nMurray mistook it for retreat, and commanded a farther advance.\r\nThe whole British line, extending itself towards the right, pushed\r\neagerly forward: in doing which it lost the advantage of the\r\nfavorable position it had occupied; and the battalions of the\r\nright soon found themselves on low grounds, wading in half-melted\r\nsnow, which in some parts was knee deep. Here the cannon could no\r\nlonger be worked with effect. Just in front, a small brook ran along\r\nthe hollow, through soft mud and saturated snowdrifts, then\r\ngurgled down the slope on the right, to lose itself in the\r\nmeadows of the St. Charles. A few rods before this brook\r\nstood the house and windmill of Dumont, occupied by five\r\ncompanies of French grenadiers. The light infantry at once\r\nattacked them. A furious struggle ensued, till at length the\r\nFrench gave way, and the victors dashed forward to follow\r\nup their advantage. Their ardor cost them dear. The corps on\r\nthe French left, which had fallen back into the woods, now\r\nadvanced again as the cannon ceased to play, rushing on without\r\norder but with the utmost impetuosity, led by a gallant old\r\nofficer, Colonel Dalquier, of the battalion of Béarn. A bullet in\r\nthe body could not stop him. The light infantry were overwhelmed;\r\nand such of them as were left alive were driven back in confusion\r\nupon the battalions behind them, along the front of which they\r\nremained dispersed for some minutes, preventing the troops from\r\nfiring on the advancing French, whothus had time to reform their\r\nranks. At length the light infantrygot themselves out of the way\r\nand retired to the rear, where, having lost nearly all their officers,\r\nthey remained during the rest of the fight. Another struggle followed\r\nfor the house and mill of Dumont, of which the French again got\r\npossession, to be again driven out; and it remained, as if by mutual\r\nconsent, unoccupied for some time by either party. For above an hour\r\nmore the fight was hot and fierce. \"We drove them back as\r\nlong as we had ammunition for our cannon,\" says Sergeant\r\nJohnson; but now it failed, and no more was to be had, because,\r\nin the eccentric phrase of the sergeant, the tumbrils were \"bogged\r\nin deep pits of snow.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this was passing on the English right, it fared still\r\nworse with them on the left. The advance of the line was no\r\nless disastrous here than there. It brought the troops close to\r\nthe woods which circled round to this point from the French\r\nrear, and from which the Canadians, covered by the trees, now\r\npoured on them a deadly fire. Here, as on the right, Lévis had\r\nordered his troops to fall back for a time; but when the fire of\r\nthe English cannon ceased, they advanced again, and their\r\nartillery, though consisting of only three pieces, played its part\r\nwith good effect. Hazen's rangers and MacDonald's volunteers\r\nattacked and took the two adjacent blockhouses, but could not\r\nhold them. Hazen was wounded, MacDonald killed, and their\r\nparty overpowered. The British battalions held their ground\r\ntill the French, whose superior numbers enabled them to extend\r\nthemselves on both sides beyond the English line, made a\r\nfurious attack on the left wing, in front and flank. The reserves\r\nwere ordered up, and the troops stood for a time in sullen\r\ndesperation under the storm of bullets; but they were dropping\r\nfast in the blood-stained snow, and the order came at length\r\nto fall back. They obeyed with curses: \"Damn it, what is falling\r\nback but retreating?\"[830] The right wing, also outflanked,\r\nfollowed the example of the left. Some of the corps tried to\r\ndrag off their cannon; but being prevented by the deep mud\r\nand snow they spiked the pieces and abandoned them. The\r\nFrench followed close, hoping to cut off the fugitives from\r\nthe gates of Quebec; till Lévis, seeing that the retreat, though\r\nprecipitate, was not entirely without order, thought best to\r\nstop the pursuit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 830: Knox, II. 295.]\r\n\r\nThe fight lasted about two hours, and did credit to both\r\nsides. The Canadians not only showed their usual address and\r\ncourage when under cover of woods, but they also fought well\r\nin the open field; and the conduct of the whole French force\r\nproved how completely they had recovered from the panic of\r\nthe last autumn. From the first they were greatly superior in\r\nnumber, and at the middle and end of the affair, when they\r\nhad all reached the field, they were more than two against\r\none.[831] The English, on the other hand, besides the opportunity\r\nof attacking before their enemies had completely formed, had\r\na vastly superior artillery and a favorable position, both which\r\nadvantages they lost after their second advance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 831: See Appendix K.]\r\n\r\nSome curious anecdotes are told of the retreat. Colonel\r\nFraser, of the Highlanders, received a bullet which was no\r\ndoubt half spent, and which, with excellent precision, hit the\r\nbase of his queue, so deadening the shock that it gave him no\r\nother inconvenience than a stiff neck. Captain Hazen, of the\r\nrangers, badly wounded, was making his way towards the gate,\r\nsupported by his servant, when he saw at a great distance\r\na French officer leading a file of men across a rising ground;\r\nwhereupon he stopped and told the servant to give him his\r\ngun. A volunteer named Thompson, who was near by and who\r\ntells the story, thought that he was out of his senses; but Hazen\r\npersisted, seated himself on the ground, took a long aim, fired,\r\nand brought down his man. Thompson congratulated him. \"A\r\nchance shot may kill the devil,\" replied Hazen; and resigning\r\nhimself again to the arms of his attendant, he reached the\r\ntown, recovered from his wound, and lived to be a general of\r\nthe Revolution.[832]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 832: Thompson, deceived by Hazen's baptismal name, Moses,\r\nthought that he was a Jew. (_Revue Canadienne_, IV, 865.) He was,\r\nhowever, of an old New England Puritan family. See the Hazen\r\ngenealogy in _Historic-Genealogical Register_, XXXIII.]\r\n\r\nThe English lost above a thousand, or more than a third\r\nof their whole number, killed, wounded, and missing.[833] They\r\ncarried off some of their wounded, but left others behind;\r\nand the greater part of these were murdered, scalped, and\r\nmangled by the Indians, all of whom were converts from the\r\nmission villages. English writers put the French loss at two\r\nthousand and upwards, which is no doubt a gross exaggeration.\r\nLévis declares that the number did not exceed six or eight hundred;\r\nbut afterwards gives a list which makes it eight hundred and\r\nthirty-three.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 833: _Return of Killed, Wounded, and Missing_, signed J. Murray.]\r\n\r\nMurray had left three or four hundred men to guard Quebec\r\nwhen the rest marched out; and adding them to those who had returned\r\nscathless from the fight, he now had about twenty-four hundred rank\r\nand file fit for duty. Yet even the troops that were rated as effective\r\nwere in so bad a condition that the hyperbolical Sergeant Johnson\r\ncalls them \"half-starved, scorbutic skeletons.\" That worthy soldier,\r\ncommonly a model of dutiful respect to those above him, this time so\r\nfar forgets himself as to criticise his general for the \"mad,\r\nenthusiastic zeal\" by which he nearly lost the fruits of Wolfe's\r\nvictory. In fact, the fate of Quebec trembled in the balance.\r\n\"We were too few and weak to stand an assault,\" continues\r\nJohnson, \"and we were almost in as deep a distress as we\r\ncould be.\" At first there was some drunkenness and some\r\nplundering of private houses; but Murray stopped the one by\r\nstaving the rum-barrels of the sutlers, and the other by hanging\r\nthe chief offender. Within three days order, subordination,\r\nhope, and almost confidence were completely restored. Not\r\na man was idle. The troops left their barracks and lay in tents\r\nclose to their respective alarm posts. On the open space by\r\nSt. Louis Gate a crowd of convalescents were busy in filling\r\nsand-bags to strengthen the defences, while the sick and\r\nwounded in the hospitals made wadding for the cannon. The\r\nramparts were faced with fascines, of which a large stock\r\nhad been provided in the autumn; _chevaux-de-frise_ were\r\nplanted in exposed places; an outwork was built to protect\r\nSt. Louis Gate; embrasures were cut along the whole length\r\nof the walls; and the French cannon captured when the town\r\nwas taken were planted against their late owners. Every man\r\nwas tasked to the utmost of his strength; and the garrison,\r\ngaunt, worn, besmirched with mud, looked less like soldiers\r\nthan like overworked laborers.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the officers troubled the spirit of Sergeant\r\nJohnson. It shocked his sense of the fitness of things to see\r\nthem sharing the hard work of the private men, and he thus\r\ngives utterance to his feelings: \"None but those who were\r\npresent on the spot can imagine the grief of heart the soldiers\r\nfelt to see their officers yoked in the harness, dragging up\r\ncannon from the Lower Town; to see gentlemen, who were set over them\r\nby His Majesty to command and keep them to their duty, working at\r\nthe batteries with the barrow, pickaxe, and spade.\" The effect,\r\nhowever, was admirable. The spirit of the men rose to the crisis.\r\nMurray, no less than his officers, had all their confidence; for if\r\nhe had fallen into a fatal error, he atoned for it now by unconquerable\r\nresolution and exhaustless fertility of resource. Deserters said that\r\nLévis would assault the town; and the soldiers replied: \"Let him come on;\r\nhe will catch a Tartar.\"\r\n\r\nLévis and his army were no less busy in digging trenches\r\nalong the stony back of the Buttes-à-Neveu. Every day the\r\nEnglish fire grew hotter; till at last nearly a hundred and fifty\r\ncannon vomited iron upon them from the walls of Quebec,\r\nand May was well advanced before they could plant a single\r\ngun to reply. Their vessels had landed artillery at the Anse\r\ndu Foulon; but their best hope lay in the succors they daily\r\nexpected from the river below. In the autumn Lévis, with a\r\nview to his intended enterprise, had sent a request to Versailles\r\nthat a ship laden with munitions and heavy siege-guns should be sent\r\nfrom France in time to meet him at Quebec in April; while he looked\r\nalso for another ship, which had wintered at Gaspé, and which therefore\r\nmight reach him as soon as navigation opened. The arrival of these\r\nvessels would have made the position of the English doubly critical; and,\r\non the other hand, should an English squadron appear first,\r\nLévis would be forced to raise the siege. Thus each side\r\nwatched the river with an anxiety that grew constantly more\r\nintense; and the English presently descried signals along the\r\nshore which seemed to say that French ships were moving\r\nup the St. Lawrence. Meantime, while doing their best to\r\ncompass each other's destruction, neither side forgot the\r\ncourtesies of war. Lévis heard that Murray liked spruce-beer\r\nfor his table, and sent him a flag of truce with a quantity of\r\nspruce-boughs and a message of compliment; Murray responded\r\nwith a Cheshire cheese, and Lévis rejoined with a present of\r\npartridges.\r\n\r\nBad and scanty fare, excessive toil, and broken sleep were\r\ntelling ominously on the strength of the garrison when, on the\r\nninth of May, Murray, as he sat pondering over the fire at\r\nhis quarters in St. Louis Street, was interrupted by an officer\r\nwho came to tell him that there was a ship-of-war in the\r\nBasin beating up towards the town. Murray started from his\r\nrevery, and directed that British colors should be raised immediately\r\non Cape Diamond.[834] The halyards being out of order, a sailor\r\nclimbed the staff and drew up the flag to its place. The news had\r\nspread; men and officers, divided between hope and fear, crowded\r\nto the rampart by the Château, where Durham Terrace now overlooks\r\nthe St. Lawrence, and every eye was strained on the approaching ship,\r\neager to see whether she would show the red flag of England or the\r\nwhite one of France. Slowly her colors rose to the mast-head and\r\nunfurled to the wind the red cross of St. George. It was the\r\nBritish frigate \"Lowestoffe.\" She anchored before the Lower\r\nTown, and saluted the garrison with twenty-one guns. \"The\r\ngladness of the troops,\" says Knox, \"is not to be expressed.\r\nBoth officers and soldiers mounted the parapet in the face\r\nof the enemy and huzzaed with their hats in the air for almost\r\nan hour. The garrison, the enemy's camp, the bay, and circumjacent\r\ncountry resounded with our shouts and the thunder of our artillery;\r\nfor the gunners were so elated that they did nothing but load and\r\nfire for a considerable time. In short, the general satisfaction\r\nis not to be conceived, except by a person who had suffered the\r\nextremities of a siege, and been destined, with his brave friends\r\nand countrymen, to the scalping-knives of a faithless conqueror\r\nand his barbarious allies.\" The \"Lowestoffe\" brought news that a\r\nBritish squadron was at the mouth of the St. Lawrence, and would\r\nreach Quebec in a few days.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 834: Thompson in _Revue Canadienne_, IV. 866.]\r\n\r\nLévis, in ignorance of this, still clung to the hope that\r\nFrench ships would arrive strong enough to overpower the\r\nunwelcome stranger. His guns, being at last in position,\r\npresently opened fire upon a wall that was not built to bear\r\nthe brunt of heavy shot; but an artillery better and more\r\nnumerous than his own almost silenced them, and his gunners\r\nwere harassed by repeated sallies. The besiegers had now no\r\nreal chance of success unless they could carry the place by\r\nstorm, to which end they had provided abundant scaling-ladders\r\nas well as petards to burst in the gates. They made, however, no\r\nattempt to use them. A week passed, when, on the evening of the\r\nfifteenth, the ship of the line \"Vanguard\" and the frigate \"Diana\"\r\nsailed into the harbor; and on the next morning the \"Diana\" and\r\nthe \"Lowestoffe\" passed the town to attack the French vessels\r\nin the river above. These were six in all,--two frigates, two\r\nsmaller armed ships, and two schooners; the whole under command\r\nof the gallant Vauquelin. He did not belie his reputation; fought\r\nhis ship with persistent bravery till his ammunition was spent,\r\nrefused even then to strike his flag, and being made prisoner,\r\nwas treated by his captors with distinguished honor. The\r\nother vessels made little or no resistance. One of them threw\r\nher guns overboard and escaped; the rest ran ashore and\r\nwere burned.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of his vessels was a death-blow to the\r\nhopes of Lévis, for they contained his stores of food and\r\nammunition. He had passed the preceding night in great agitation;\r\nand when the cannonade on the river ceased, he hastened to raise the\r\nsiege. In the evening deserters from hiscamp told Murray that the\r\nFrench were in full retreat; on which all the English batteries\r\nopened, firing at random through the darkness, and sending cannon-balls\r\n_en ricochet_, bowling by scores together, over the Plains of\r\nAbraham on the heels of the retiring enemy. Murray marched out at\r\ndawn of day to fall upon their rear; but, with a hundred and\r\nfifty cannon bellowing behind them, they had made such speed that,\r\nthough he pushed over the marsh to Old Lorette, he could not overtake\r\nthem; they had already crossed the river of Cap-Rouge. Why, with\r\nnumbers still superior, they went off in such haste, it is hard to\r\nsay. They left behind them thirty-four cannon and six mortars, with\r\npetards, scaling-ladders, tents, ammunition, baggage, intrenching\r\ntools, many of their muskets, and all their sick and wounded.\r\n\r\nThe effort to recover Quebec did great honor to the enterprise\r\nof the French; but it availed them nothing, served only\r\nto waste resources that seemed already at the lowest ebb,\r\nand gave fresh opportunity of plunder to Cadet and his crew,\r\nwho failed not to make use of it.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Ste.-Foy Murray sent the frigate \"Racehorse\"\r\nto Halifax with news of his defeat, and from Halifax it was sent\r\nto England. The British public were taken by surprise. \"Who the\r\ndeuce was thinking of Quebec?\" says Horace Walpole. \"America was\r\nlike a book one has read and done with; but here we are on a\r\nsudden reading our book backwards.\" Ten days passed, and then\r\ncame word that the siege was raised and that the French were gone;\r\nupon which Walpole wrote to General Conway: \"Well, Quebec is\r\ncome to life again. Last night I went to see the Holdernesses.\r\nI met my Lady in a triumphal car, drawn by a Manx horse,\r\nthirteen little fingers high, with Lady Emily. Mr. Milbank\r\nwas walking by himself in ovation after the car, and they\r\nwere going to see the bonfire at the alehouse at the corner.\r\nThe whole procession returned with me; and from the Countess's\r\ndressing-room we saw a battery fired before the house, the mob crying,\r\n'God bless the good news!' These are all the particulars I know of the\r\nsiege. My Lord would have showed me the journal; but we amused ourselves\r\nmuch better in going to eat peaches from the new Dutch stoves\r\n[_hothouses_].\"\r\n\r\nNOTE: On the battle of Ste.-Foy and the subsequent siege,\r\nLévis, _Guerre du Canada.

On the force engaged\r\non each side, see Appendix K.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 30\r\n\r\n1760\r\n\r\nFall of Canada\r\n\r\n\r\nThe retreat of Lévis left Canada little hope but in a speedy\r\npeace. This hope was strong, for a belief widely prevailed\r\nthat, even if the colony should be subdued, it would be restored\r\nto France by treaty. Its available force did not exceed\r\neight or ten thousand men, as most of the Canadians below\r\nthe district of Three Rivers had sworn allegiance to King\r\nGeorge; and though many of them had disregarded the oath\r\nto join the standard of Lévis, they could venture to do so no\r\nlonger. The French had lost the best of their artillery, their\r\ngunpowder was falling short, their provisions would barely\r\ncarry them to harvest time, and no more was to be hoped\r\nfor, since a convoy of ships which had sailed from France\r\nat the end of winter, laden with supplies of all kinds, had\r\nbeen captured by the English. The blockade of the St. Lawrence\r\nwas complete. The Western Indians would not fight, and even those\r\nof the mission villages were wavering and insolent.\r\n\r\nYet Vaudreuil and Lévis exerted themselves for defence\r\nwith an energy that does honor to them both. \"Far from\r\nshowing the least timidity,\" says the ever-modest Governor,\r\n\"I have taken positions such as may hide our weakness from\r\nthe enemy.\"[835] He stationed Rochbeaucourt with three hundred\r\nmen at Pointe-aux-Trembles; Repentigny with two hundred\r\nat Jacques-Cartier; and Dumas with twelve hundred at\r\nDeschambault to watch the St. Lawrence and, if possible,\r\nprevent Murray from moving up the river. Bougainville was\r\nstationed at Isle-aux-Noix to bar the approach from Lake\r\nChamplain, and a force under La Corne was held ready to\r\ndefend the rapids above Montreal, should the English attempt\r\nthat dangerous passage. Prisoners taken by war parties near\r\nCrown Point gave exaggerated reports of hostile preparation,\r\nand doubled and trebled the forces that were mustering against\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 835: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 22 Juin, 1760_.]\r\n\r\nThese forces were nevertheless considerable. Amherst had\r\nresolved to enter the colony by all its three gates at once,\r\nand, advancing from east, west, and south, unite at Montreal\r\nand crush it as in the jaws of a vice. Murray was to ascend\r\nthe St. Lawrence from Quebec, while Brigadier Haviland forced an\r\nentrance by way of Lake Champlain, and Amherst himself led the\r\nmain army down the St. Lawrence from Lake Ontario. This last\r\nroute was long, circuitous, difficult, andfull of danger from\r\nthe rapids that obstructed the river. His choice of it for his\r\nchief line of operation, instead of the shorter and easier way\r\nof Lake Champlain, was meant, no doubt, to prevent the French\r\narmy from escaping up the Lakes to Detroit and the other wilderness\r\nposts, where it might have protracted the war for an indefinite\r\ntime; while the plan adopted, if successful, would make its capture\r\ncertain. The plan was a critical one. Three armies advancing\r\nfrom three different points, hundreds of miles apart, by routes\r\nfull of difficulty, and with no possibility of intercommunication,\r\nwere to meet at the same place at the same time, or, failing to do\r\nso, run the risk of being destroyed in detail. If the French troops\r\ncould be kept together, and if the small army of Murray or of\r\nHaviland should reach Montreal a few days before the co-operating\r\nforces appeared, it might be separately attacked and overpowered.\r\nIn this lay the hope of Vaudreuil and Lévis.[836]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 836: _Lévis à Bourlamaque, Juillet, Août, 1760_.]\r\n\r\nAfter the siege of Quebec was raised, Murray had an\r\neffective force of about twenty-five hundred rank and file.[837]\r\nAs the spring opened the invalids were encamped on the Island of\r\nOrleans, where fresh air, fresh provisions, and the change from\r\nthe pestiferous town hospitals wrought such wonders on the scorbutic\r\npatients, that in a few weeks a considerable number of them were\r\nagain fit for garrison duty, if not for the field. Thus it happened\r\nthat on the second of July twenty-four hundred and fifty men and\r\nofficers received orders to embark for Montreal; and on the fifteenth\r\nthey set sail, in thirty-two vessels, with a number of boats and\r\nbateaux.[838] They were followed some time after by Lord Rollo,\r\nwith thirteen hundred additional men just arrived from Louisbourg,\r\nthe King having ordered that fortress to be abandoned and dismantled.\r\nThey advanced slowly, landing from time to time, skirmishing with\r\ndetachments of the enemy who followed them along the shore, or\r\nmore frequently trading with the farmers who brought them vegetables,\r\npoultry, eggs, and fresh meat. They passed the fortified hill of\r\nJacques-Cartier, whence they were saluted with shot and shell,\r\nstopped at various parishes, disarmed the inhabitants, administered\r\noaths of neutrality, which were taken without much apparent reluctance,\r\nand on the fourth of August came within sight of Three Rivers, then\r\noccupied by a body of troops expecting an attack. \"But,\" says Knox,\r\n\"a delay here would be absurd, as that wretched place must share the\r\nfate of Montreal. Our fleet sailed this morning. The French\r\ntroops, apparently about two thousand, lined their different\r\nworks, and were in general clothed as regulars, except a very\r\nfew Canadians and about fifty naked Picts or savages, their\r\nbodies being painted of a reddish color and their faces of\r\ndifferent colors, which I plainly discerned with my glass.\r\nTheir light cavalry, who paraded along shore, seemed to be\r\nwell appointed, clothed in blue, faced with scarlet; but their\r\nofficers had white uniforms. In fine, their troops, batteries,\r\nfair-looking houses; their situation on the banks of a delightful\r\nriver; our fleet sailing triumphantly before them, with our\r\nfloating batteries drawn up in line of battle; the country on\r\nboth sides interspersed with neat settlements, together with\r\nthe verdure of the fields and trees and the clear, pleasant\r\nweather, afforded as agreeable a prospect as the most lively\r\nimagination can conceive.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 837: _Return of the Present State of His Majesty's Forces\r\nin Garrison at Quebec, 21 May, 1760_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 838: Knox, II. 344, 348.]\r\n\r\nThis excellent lover of the picturesque was still more delighted\r\nas the fleet sailed among the islands of St. Peter. \"I think nothing\r\ncould equal the beauties of our navigation this morning: the meandering\r\ncourse of the narrow channel; the awfulness and solemnity of the dark\r\nforests with which these islands are covered; the fragrancy of the\r\nspontaneous fruits, shrubs, and flowers; the verdure of the water by\r\nthe reflection of the neighboring woods; the wild chirping notes of the\r\nfeathered inhabitants; the masts and sails of ships appearing\r\nas if among the trees, both ahead and astern: formed altogether\r\nan enchanting diversity.\"\r\n\r\nThe evening recalled him from dreams to realities; for\r\ntowards seven o'clock they reached the village of Sorel, where\r\nthey found a large body of troops and militia intrenched\r\nalong the strand. Bourlamaque was in command here with two or three\r\nthousand men, and Dumas, with another body, was on the northern shore.\r\nBoth had orders to keep abreast of the fleet as it advanced; and thus\r\nFrench and English alike drew slowly towards Montreal, where lay the\r\nmain French force under Lévis, ready to unite with Bourlamaque\r\nand Dumas, and fall upon Murray at the first opportunity.\r\nMontreal was now but a few leagues distant, and the situation\r\nwas becoming delicate. Murray sent five rangers towards\r\nLake Champlain to get news of Haviland, and took measures\r\nat the same time to cause the desertion of the Canadians,\r\nwho formed the largest part of the opposing force. He sent\r\na proclamation among the parishes, advising the inhabitants\r\nto remain peacefully at home, promising that those who did\r\nso should be safe in person and property, and threatening to\r\nburn every house from which the men of the family were absent.\r\nThese were not idle words. A detachment sent for the purpose destroyed\r\na settlement near Sorel, the owners of which were in arms under\r\nBourlamaque. \"I was under the cruel necessity of burning the greatest\r\npart of these poor unhappy people's houses,\" wrote Murray. \"I pray God\r\nthis example may suffice, for my nature revolts when this becomes\r\na necessary part of my duty.\"[839] On the other hand, he treated\r\nwith great kindness all who left the army and returned to\r\ntheir families. The effect was soon felt. The Canadians came\r\nin by scores and by hundreds to give up their arms and take\r\nthe oath of neutrality, till, before the end of August, half\r\nBourlamaque's force had disappeared. Murray encamped on\r\nIsle Ste.-Thérèse, just below Montreal, and watched and\r\nwaited for Haviland and Amherst to appear.[840]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 839: _Murray to Pitt, 24 Aug. 1760_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 840: Knox, II. 382, 384. Mante, 340.]\r\n\r\nVaudreuil on his part was not idle. He sent a counter-proclamation\r\nthrough the parishes as an antidote to that of Murray. \"I have been\r\ncompelled,\" he writes to the Minister, \"to decree the pain of\r\ndeath to the Canadians who are so dastardly as to desert or give\r\nup their arms to the enemy, and to order that the houses of those\r\nwho do not join our army shall be burned.\"[841] Execution was to be\r\nsummary, without court-martial.[842] Yet desertion increased daily.\r\nThe Canadians felt themselves doubly ruined, for it became known that\r\nthe Court had refused to redeem the paper that formed the whole\r\ncurrency of the colony; and, in their desperation, they preferred\r\nto trust the tried clemency of the enemy rather than exasperate him\r\nby persisting in a vain defence. Vaudreuil writes in his usual strain:\r\n\"I am taking the most just measures to unite our forces, and, if our\r\nsituation permits, fight a battle, or several battles. It is to be\r\nfeared that we shall go down before an enemy so numerous and strong;\r\nbut, whatever may be the event, we will save the honor of the King's\r\narms. I have the honor to repeat to you, Monseigneur, that\r\nif any resource were left me, whatever the progress the English\r\nmight make, I would maintain myself in some part of the colony with my\r\nremaining troops, after having fought with the greatest obstinacy; but\r\nI am absolutely without the least remnant of the necessary means. In\r\nthese unhappy circumstances I shall continue to use every manoeuvre and\r\ndevice to keep the enemy in check; but if we succumb in the\r\nbattles we shall fight, I shall apply myself to obtaining a capitulation\r\nwhich may avert the total ruin of a people who will remain forever French,\r\nand who could not survive their misfortunes but for the hope of being\r\nrestored by the treaty of peace to the rule of His Most Christian\r\nMajesty. It is with this view that I shall remain in this town, the\r\nChevalier de Lévis having represented to me that it would be an evil\r\nto the colonists past remedy if any accident should happen to me.\"\r\nLévis was willing to go very far in soothing the susceptibilities\r\nof the Governor; but it may be suspected this time that he\r\nthought him more useful within four walls than in the open\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 841: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 29 Août, 1760_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 842: _Lévis à Bourlamaque, 25 Août, 1760_.]\r\n\r\nThere seemed good hope of stopping the advance of Haviland.\r\nTo this end Vaudreuil had stationed Bougainville at Isle-aux-Noix\r\nwith seventeen hundred men, and Roquemaure at St. John, a few\r\nmiles distant, with twelve or fifteen hundred more, besides all\r\nthe Indians.[843] Haviland embarked at Crown Point with thirty-four\r\nhundred regulars, provincials, and Indians.[844] Four days brought\r\nhim to Isle-aux-Noix; he landed, planted cannon in the swamp, and\r\nopened fire. Major Darby with the light infantry, and Rogers with\r\nthe rangers, dragged three light pieces through the forest, and\r\nplanted them on the river-bank in the rear of Bougainville's position,\r\nwhere lay the French naval force, consisting of three armed\r\nvessels and several gunboats. The cannon were turned upon\r\nthe principal ship; a shot cut her cable, and a strong west\r\nwind drove her ashore into the hands of her enemies. The\r\nother vessels and gunboats made all sail for St. John, but\r\nstranded in a bend of the river, where the rangers, swimming\r\nout with their tomahawks, boarded and took one of them,\r\nand the rest soon surrendered. It was a fatal blow to Bougainville,\r\nwhose communications with St. John were now cut off. In accordance\r\nwith instructions from Vaudreuil, he abandoned the island on the\r\nnight of the twenty-seventh of August, and, making his way with\r\ninfinite difficulty through the dark forest, joined Roquemaure\r\nat St. John, twelve miles below. Haviland followed, the rangers\r\nleading the way. Bougainville and Roquemaure fell back, abandoned\r\nSt. John and Chambly, and joined Bourlamaque on the banks of the\r\nSt. Lawrence, where the united force at first outnumbered that of\r\nHaviland, though fast melted away by discouragement and desertion.\r\nHaviland opened communication with Murray, and they both\r\nlooked daily for the arrival of Amherst, whose approach was\r\nrumored by prisoners and deserters.[845]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 843: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 29 Août, 1760_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 844: _A List of the Forces employed in the Expedition against\r\nCanada, 1760_. Compare Mante, 340, Knox, II. 392, and Rogers,\r\n188. Chevalier Johnstone, who was with Bougainville, says \"about\r\nfour thousand,\" which Vaudreuil multiplies to twelve thousand.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 845: Rogers, _Journals. Diary of a Sergeant in the Army of\r\nHaviland_. Johnstone, _Campaign of 1760. Bigot au Ministre, 29 Août,\r\n1760_.]\r\n\r\nThe army of Amherst had gathered at Oswego in July. On\r\nthe tenth of August it was all afloat on Lake Ontario, to the\r\nnumber of ten thousand one hundred and forty-two men, besides about\r\nseven hundred Indians under Sir William Johnson.[846]Before the\r\nfifteenth the whole had reached La Présentation, otherwise called\r\nOswegatchie or La Galette, the seat of Father Piquet's mission. Near\r\nby was a French armed brig, the \"Ottawa,\" with ten cannon and a hundred\r\nmen, threatening destruction to Amherst's bateaux and whaleboats.\r\nFive gunboats attacked and captured her. Then the army advanced again,\r\nand were presently joined by two armed vessels of their own which had\r\nlingered behind, bewildered among the channels of the Thousand Islands.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 846: _A List of the Forces employed in the Expedition against\r\nCanada_. Compare Mante, 301, and Knox, II. 403.]\r\n\r\nNear the head of the rapids, a little below La Galette,\r\nstood Fort Lévis, built the year before on an islet in mid-channel.\r\nAmherst might have passed its batteries with slight loss, continuing\r\nhis voyage without paying it the honor of a siege; and this was what\r\nthe French commanders feared that he would do. \"We shall be fortunate,\"\r\nLévis wrote to Bourlamaque, \"if the enemy amuse themselves with capturing\r\nit. My chief anxiety is lest Amherst should reach Montreal\r\nso soon that we may not have time to unite our forces to attack Haviland\r\nor Murray.\" If he had better known the English commander, Lévis would\r\nhave seen that he was not the man to leave a post of the enemy in his\r\nrear under any circumstances; and Amherst had also another reason for\r\nwishing to get the garrison into his hands, for he expected to\r\nfind among them the pilots whom he needed to guide his boats down the\r\nrapids. He therefore invested the fort, and, on the twenty-third,\r\ncannonaded it from his vessels, the mainland, and the neighboring\r\nislands. It was commanded by Pouchot, the late commandant of Niagara,\r\nmade prisoner in the last campaign, and since exchanged. As the rocky\r\nislet had but little earth, the defences, though thick and\r\nstrong, were chiefly of logs, which flew in splinters under the\r\nbombardment. The French, however, made a brave resistance.\r\nThe firing lasted all day, was resumed in the morning, and\r\ncontinued two days more; when Pouchot, whose works were\r\nin ruins, surrendered himself and his garrison. On this, Johnson's\r\nIndians prepared to kill the prisoners; and, being compelled\r\nto desist, three fourths of them went home in a rage.[847]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 847: On the capture of Fort Lévis, _Amherst to Pitt, 26 Aug.\r\n1760.

Mante, 303-306. _All Canada in the Hands of the\r\nEnglish_ (Boston, 1760). _Journal of Colonel Nathaniel Woodhull_.]\r\n\r\nNow began the critical part of the expedition, the descent\r\nof the rapids. The Galops, the Rapide Plat, the Long Saut,\r\nthe Côteau du Lac were passed in succession, with little loss,\r\ntill they reached the Cedars, the Buisson, and the Cascades,\r\nwhere the reckless surges dashed and bounded in the sun,\r\nbeautiful and terrible as young tigers at play. Boat after boat,\r\nborne on their foaming crests, rushed madly down the torrent.\r\nForty-six were totally wrecked, eighteen were damaged, and eighty-four\r\nmen were drowned.[848] La Corne was watching the rapids with a\r\nconsiderable body of Canadians; and it is difficult to see why this\r\nbold and enterprising chief allowed the army to descend undisturbed\r\nthrough passes so dangerous. At length the last rapid was left behind;\r\nand the flotilla, gliding in peace over the smooth breast of Lake\r\nSt. Louis, landed at Isle Perrot, a few leagues from Montreal. In\r\nthe morning, September sixth, the troops embarked again, landed\r\nunopposed at La Chine, nine miles from the city, marched on\r\nwithout delay, and encamped before its walls.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 848: _Amherst to Pitt, 8 Sept. 1760_.]\r\n\r\nThe Montreal of that time was a long, narrow assemblage\r\nof wooden or stone houses, one or two stories high, above\r\nwhich rose the peaked towers of the Seminary, the spires of\r\nthree churches, the walls of four convents, with the trees of\r\ntheir adjacent gardens, and, conspicuous at the lower end,\r\na high mound of earth, crowned by a redoubt, where a few\r\ncannon were mounted. The whole was surrounded by a shallow\r\nmoat and a bastioned stone wall, made for defenceagainst Indians,\r\nand incapable of resisting cannon.[849]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 849: _An East View of Montreal, drawn on the Spot by Thomas\r\nPatten_ (King's Maps, British Museum), _Plan of Montreal, 1759.\r\nA Description of Montreal_, in several magazines of the time. The\r\nrecent Canadian publication called _Le Vieux Montréal_, is exceedingly\r\nincorrect as to the numbers of the British troops and the\r\nposition of their camps.]\r\n\r\nOn the morning after Amherst encamped above the place,\r\nMurray landed to encamp below it; and Vaudreuil, looking\r\nacross the St. Lawrence, could see the tents of Haviland's\r\nlittle army on the southern shore. Bourlamaque, Bougainville,\r\nand Roquemaure, abandoned by all their militia, had crossed\r\nto Montreal with the few regulars that remained with them.\r\nThe town was crowded with non-combatant refugees. Here,\r\ntoo, was nearly all the remaining force of Canada, consisting\r\nof twenty-two hundred troops of the line and some two hundred\r\ncolony troops; for all the Canadians had by this time gone home.\r\nMany of the regulars, especially of the colony troops, had also\r\ndeserted; and the rest were so broken in discipline that their\r\nofficers were forced to use entreaties instead of commands. The\r\nthree armies encamped around the city amounted to seventeen\r\nthousand men;[850] Amherst was bringing up his cannon from La\r\nChine, and the town wall would have crumbled before them in an hour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 850: _A List of the Forces employed in the Expedition\r\nagainst Canada_. See Smith, _History of Canada_, I. Appendix xix.\r\nVaudreuil writes to Charles Langlade, on the ninth, that the three\r\narmies amount to twenty thousand, and raises the number to thirty-two\r\nthousand in a letter to the Minister on the next day. Berniers says\r\ntwenty thousand; Lévis, for obvious reasons, exaggerates the\r\nnumber to forty thousand.]\r\n\r\nOn the night when Amherst arrived, the Governor called\r\na council of war.[851] It was resolved that since all the militia\r\nand many of the regulars had abandoned the army, and the\r\nIndian allies of France had gone over to the enemy, further\r\nresistance was impossible. Vaudreuil laid before the assembled\r\nofficers a long paper that he had drawn up, containing fifty-five\r\narticles of capitulation to be proposed to the English;\r\nand these were unanimously approved.[852] In the morning\r\nBougainville carried them to the tent of Amherst. He granted\r\nthe greater part, modified some, and flatly refused others.\r\nThat which the French officers thought more important than\r\nall the rest was the provision that the troops should march\r\nout with arms, cannon, and the honors of war; to which it\r\nwas replied: \"The whole garrison of Montreal and all other\r\nFrench troops in Canada must lay down their arms, and shall not\r\nserve during the present war.\" This demand was felt to be intolerable.\r\nThe Governor sent Bougainville back to remonstrate; but Amherst was\r\ninflexible. Then Lévis tried to shake his resolution, and sent him an\r\nofficer with the following note: \"I send your Excellency M. de la\r\nPause, Assistant Quartermaster-General of the Army, on the subject of\r\nthe too rigorous article which you dictate to the troops by the\r\ncapitulation, to which it would not be possible for us to subscribe.\"\r\nAmherst answered the envoy: \"I am fully resolved, for the infamous part\r\nthe troops of France have acted in exciting the savages to perpetrate the\r\nmost horrid and unheard of barbarities in the whole progress of the war,\r\nand for other open treacheries and flagrant breaches of faith, to manifest\r\nto all the world by this capitulation my detestation of such practices;\"\r\nand he dismissed La Pause with a short note, refusing to change the\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 851: _Vaudreuil au Ministre, 10 Sept. 1760_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 852: _Procès-verbal de la Déliberation du Conseil de Guerre tenu\r\nà Montréal, 6 Sept. 1760_.]\r\n\r\nOn the next morning, September eighth, Vaudreuil yielded,\r\nand signed the capitulation. By it Canada and all its dependencies\r\npassed to the British Crown. French officers, civil and\r\nmilitary, with French troops and sailors, were to be sent to\r\nFrance in British ships. Free exercise of religion was assured\r\nto the people of the colony, and the religious communities\r\nwere to retain their possessions, rights, and privileges. All\r\npersons who might wish to retire to France were allowed to\r\ndo so, and the Canadians were to remain in full enjoyment\r\nof feudal and other property, including negro and Indian\r\nslaves.[853]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 853: _Articles of Capitulation, 8 Sept. 1760. Amherst to Pitt,\r\nsame date_.]\r\n\r\nThe greatest alarm had prevailed among the inhabitants\r\nlest they should suffer violence from the English Indians, and\r\nVaudreuil had endeavored to provide that these dangerous\r\nenemies should be sent back at once to their villages. This\r\nwas refused, with the remark: \"There never have been any\r\ncruelties committed by the Indians of our army.\" Strict precautions\r\nwere taken at the same time, not only against the few savages whom the\r\nfirm conduct of Johnson at Fort Lévis had not driven away, but also\r\nagainst the late allies of the French, now become a peril to them. In\r\nconsequence, not a man, woman, or child was hurt. Amherst, in general\r\norders, expressed his confidence \"that the troops will not disgrace\r\nthemselves by the least appearance of inhumanity, or by any\r\nunsoldierlike behavior in seeking for plunder; and that as the\r\nCanadians are now become British subjects, they will feel the\r\ngood effects of His Majesty's protection.\" They were in fact\r\ntreated with a kindness that seemed to surprise them.\r\n\r\nLévis was so incensed at the demand that the troops should\r\nlay down their arms and serve no longer during the war that,\r\nbefore the capitulation was signed, he made a formal protest[854]\r\nin his own name and that of the officers from France, and\r\ninsisted that the negotiation should be broken off. \"If,\" he\r\nadded, \"the Marquis de Vaudreuil, through political motives,\r\nthinks himself obliged to surrender the colony at once, we\r\nask his permission to withdraw with the troops of the line to\r\nthe Island of St. Helen, in order to uphold there, on our own\r\nbehalf, the honor of the King's arms.\" The proposal was of\r\ncourse rejected, as Lévis knew that it would be, and he and\r\nhis officers were ordered to conform to the capitulation. When\r\nVaudreuil reached France, three months after, he had the\r\nmortification to receive from the Colonial Minister a letter\r\ncontaining these words: \"Though His Majesty was perfectly\r\naware of the state of Canada, nevertheless, after the assurances\r\nyou had given to make the utmost efforts to sustain the\r\nhonor of his arms, he did not expect to hear so soon of the\r\nsurrender of Montreal and the whole colony. But, granting\r\nthat capitulation was a necessity, his Majesty was not the less\r\nsurprised and ill pleased at the conditions, so little honorable,\r\nto which you submitted, especially after the representations\r\nmade you by the Chevalier de Lévis.\"[855] The brother of\r\nVaudreuil complained to the Minister of the terms of this\r\nletter, and the Minister replied: \"I see with regret, Monsieur,\r\nthat you are pained by the letter I wrote your brother; but\r\nI could not help telling him what the King did me the honor\r\nto say to me; and it would have been unpleasant for him to\r\nhear it from anybody else.\"[856]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 854: _Protêt de M. de Lévis à M. de Vaudreuil contre la Clause\r\ndans les Articles de Capitulation qui exige que les Troupes mettront\r\nbas les Armes, avec l'Ordre de M. de Vaudreuil au Chevalier\r\nde Lévis de se conformer à la Capitulation proposée. Vaudreuil\r\nau Ministre de la Marine, 10 Sept. 1760. Lévis au Ministre de la\r\nGuerre, 27 Nov. 1760_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 855: _Le Ministre à Vaudreuil, 5 Déc. 1760_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 856: _Le Ministre au Vicomte de Vaudreuil, Frère du Gouverneur,\r\n21 Déc. 1760_.]\r\n\r\nIt is true that Vaudreuil had in some measure drawn this\r\nreproach upon himself by his boastings about the battles he\r\nwould fight; yet the royal displeasure was undeserved. The\r\nGovernor had no choice but to give up the colony; for Amherst had\r\nhim in his power, and knew that he could exact what terms he pleased.\r\nFurther resistance could only have ended in surrender at the discretion\r\nof the victor, and the protest of Lévis was nothing but a device to save\r\nhis own reputation and that of his brother officers from France.\r\nVaudreuil had served the King and the colony in some respects\r\nwith ability, always with an unflagging zeal; and he loved\r\nthe land of his birth with a jealous devotion that goes far\r\ntowards redeeming his miserable defects. The King himself,\r\nand not the servants whom he abandoned to their fate, was\r\nanswerable for the loss of New France.\r\n\r\nHalf the continent had changed hands at the scratch of a\r\npen. Governor Bernard, of Massachusetts, proclaimed a day\r\nof thanksgiving for the great event, and the Boston newspapers\r\nrecount how the occasion was celebrated with a parade of the cadets\r\nand other volunteer corps, a grand dinner in Faneuil Hall, music,\r\nbonfires, illuminations, firing of cannon, and, above all, by sermons\r\nin every church of the province; for the heart of early New England\r\nalways found voice through her pulpits. Before me lies a bundle of\r\nthese sermons, rescued from sixscore years of dust, scrawled on their\r\ntitle-pages with names of owners dead long ago, worm-eaten,\r\ndingy, stained with the damps of time, and uttering in quaint\r\nold letterpress the emotions of a buried and forgotten past.\r\nTriumph, gratulation, hope, breathe in every line, but no\r\nill-will against a fallen enemy. Thomas Foxcroft, pastor of\r\nthe \"Old Church in Boston,\" preaches from the text, \"The\r\nLord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad.\"\r\n\"Long,\" he says, \"had it been the common opinion, _Delenda\r\nest Carthago_, Canada must be conquered, or we could hope\r\nfor no lasting quiet in these parts; and now, through the good\r\nhand of our God upon us, we see the happy day of its accomplishment.\r\nWe behold His Majesty's victorious troops treading upon the high\r\nplaces of the enemy, their last fortress delivered up, and their\r\nwhole country surrendered to the King of Britain in the person of\r\nhis general, the intrepid, the serene, the successful Amherst.\"\r\n\r\nThe loyal John Mellen, pastor of the Second Church in\r\nLancaster, exclaims, boding nothing of the tempest to come:\r\n\"Let us fear God and honor the King, and be peaceable subjects\r\nof an easy and happy government. And may the blessing of Heaven be\r\never upon those enemies of our country that have now submitted to\r\nthe English Crown, and according to the oath they have taken lead\r\nquiet lives in all godliness and honesty.\" Then he ventures to\r\npredict that America, now thrown open to British colonists, will\r\nbe peopled in a century and a half with sixty million souls: a\r\nprophecy likely to be more than fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\"God has given us to sing this day the downfall of New\r\nFrance, the North American Babylon, New England's rival,\"\r\ncries Eli Forbes to his congregation of sober farmers and\r\nstaid matrons at the rustic village of Brookfield. Like many of\r\nhis flock, he had been to the war, having served two years\r\nas chaplain of Ruggles's Massachusetts regiment; and something\r\nof a martial spirit breathes through his discourse. He passes in\r\nreview the events of each campaign down to their triumphant close.\r\n\"Thus God was our salvation and our strength; yet he who directs\r\nthe great events of war suffered not our joy to be uninterrupted,\r\nfor we had to lament the fall of the valiant and good General Wolfe,\r\nwhose death demands a tear from every British eye, a sigh from every\r\nProtestant heart. Is he dead? I recall myself. Such heroes are immortal;\r\nhe lives on every loyal tongue; he lives in every grateful\r\nbreast; and charity bids me give him a place among the princes\r\nof heaven.\" Nor does he forget the praises of Amherst, \"the\r\nrenowned general, worthy of that most honorable of all titles,\r\nthe Christian hero; for he loves his enemies, and while he\r\nsubdues them he makes them happy. He transplants British\r\nliberty to where till now it was unknown. He acts the General,\r\nthe Briton, the Conqueror, and the Christian. What fair hopes\r\narise from the peaceful and undisturbed enjoyment of this\r\ngood land, and the blessing of our gracious God with it! Methinks\r\nI see towns enlarged, settlements increased, and this howling\r\nwilderness become a fruitful field which the Lord hath blessed;\r\nand, to complete the scene, I see churches rise and flourish in\r\nevery Christian grace where has been the seat of Satan and Indian\r\nidolatry.\"\r\n\r\nNathaniel Appleton, of Cambridge, hails the dawning of a\r\nnew era. \"Who can tell what great and glorious things God\r\nis about to bring forward in the world, and in this world of\r\nAmerica in particular? Oh, may the time come when these\r\ndeserts, which for ages unknown have been regions of darkness\r\nand habitations of cruelty, shall be illuminated with the\r\nlight of the glorious Gospel, and when this part of the world,\r\nwhich till the later ages was utterly unknown, shall be the\r\nglory and joy of the whole earth!\"\r\n\r\nOn the American continent the war was ended, and the\r\nBritish colonists breathed for a space, as they drifted unwittingly\r\ntowards a deadlier strife. They had learned hard and useful lessons.\r\nTheir mutual jealousies and disputes, the quarrels of their governors\r\nand assemblies, the want of any general military organization, and\r\nthe absence, in most of them, of military habits, joined to narrow\r\nviews of their own interest, had unfitted them to the last degree for\r\ncarrying on offensive war. Nor were the British troops sent for their\r\nsupport remarkable in the beginning for good discipline or\r\nefficient command. When hostilities broke out, the army of\r\nGreat Britain was so small as to be hardly worth the name.\r\nA new one had to be created; and thus the inexperienced\r\nShirley and the incompetent Loudon, with the futile Newcastle\r\nbehind them, had, besides their own incapacity, the disadvantage of\r\nraw troops and half-formed officers; while against them stood an\r\nenemy who, though weak in numbers, was strong in a centralized military\r\norganization, skilful leaders armed with untrammelled and absolute\r\nauthority, practised soldiers, and a population not only brave, but in\r\ngood part inured to war.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the country was another cause that helped\r\nto protract the contest. \"Geography,\" says Von Moltke, \"is\r\nthree fourths of military science;\" and never was the truth\r\nof his words more fully exemplified. Canada was fortified with\r\nvast outworks of defence in the savage forests, marshes, and\r\nmountains that encompassed her, where the thoroughfares\r\nwere streams choked with fallen trees and obstructed by\r\ncataracts. Never was the problem of moving troops, encumbered\r\nwith baggage and artillery, a more difficult one. The question was\r\nless how to fight the enemy than how to get at him. If a few\r\npracticable roads had crossed this broad tract of wilderness, the\r\nwar would have been shortened and its character changed.\r\n\r\nFrom these and other reasons, the numerical superiority\r\nof the English was to some extent made unavailing. This\r\nsuperiority, though exaggerated by French writers, was nevertheless\r\nimmense if estimated by the number of men called to arms; but only\r\na part of these could be employed in offensive operations. The rest\r\ngarrisoned forts and blockhouses and guarded the far reach of frontier\r\nfrom Nova Scotia to South Carolina, where a wily enemy, silent and\r\nsecret as fate, choosing their own time and place of attack,\r\nand striking unawares at every unguarded spot, compelled thousands\r\nof men, scattered at countless points of defence, to keep unceasing\r\nwatch against a few hundred savage marauders. Full half the\r\nlevies of the colonies, and many of the regulars, were used\r\nin service of this kind.\r\n\r\nIn actual encounters the advantage of numbers was often\r\nwith the French, through the comparative ease with which\r\nthey could concentrate their forces at a given point. Of the\r\nten considerable sieges or battles of the war, five, besides the\r\ngreat bushfight in which the Indians defeated Braddock, were\r\nvictories for France; and in four of these--Oswego, Fort\r\nWilliam Henry, Montmorenci, and Ste.-Foy--the odds were\r\ngreatly on her side.\r\n\r\nYet in this the most picturesque and dramatic of American\r\nwars, there is nothing more noteworthy than the skill with\r\nwhich the French and Canadian leaders used their advantages;\r\nthe indomitable spirit with which, slighted and abandoned as\r\nthey were, they grappled with prodigious difficulties, and the\r\ncourage with which they were seconded by regulars and militia alike.\r\nIn spite of occasional lapses, the defence of Canada deserves a tribute\r\nof admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 31\r\n\r\n1758-1763\r\n\r\nThe Peace of Paris\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the terms of the capitulation of Montreal,\r\nthe French military officers, with such of the soldiers as could\r\nbe kept together, as well as all the chief civil officers of the\r\ncolony, sailed for France in vessels provided by the conquerors.\r\nThey were voluntarily followed by the principal members of the\r\nCanadian _noblesse_, and by many of the merchants who had\r\nno mind to swear allegiance to King George. The peasants and poorer\r\ncolonists remained at home to begin a new life under a new flag.\r\n\r\nThough this exodus of the natural leaders of Canada was\r\nin good part deferred till the next year, and though the number\r\nof persons to be immediately embarked was reduced by the desertion\r\nof many French soldiers who had married Canadian wives, yet the\r\nEnglish authorities were sorely perplexed to find vessels enough\r\nfor the motley crowd of passengers. When at last they were all on\r\ntheir way, a succession of furious autumnal storms fell upon them.\r\nThe ship that carried Lévis barely escaped wreck, and that which bore\r\nVaudreuil and his wife fared little better.[857] Worst of all was the\r\nfate of the \"Auguste,\" on board of which was the bold but\r\nruthless partisan, Saint-Luc de la Corne, his brother, his children,\r\nand a party of Canadian officers, together with ladies,\r\nmerchants, and soldiers. A worthy ecclesiastical chronicler\r\npaints the unhappy vessel as a floating Babylon, and sees in\r\nher fate the stern judgment of Heaven.[858] It is true that New\r\nFrance ran riot in the last years of her existence; but before\r\nthe \"Auguste\" was well out of the St. Lawrence she was so\r\ntossed and buffeted, so lashed with waves and pelted with rain,\r\nthat the most alluring forms of sin must have lost their charm,\r\nand her inmates passed days rather of penance than transgression.\r\nThere was a violent storm as the ship entered the Gulf; then a calm,\r\nduring which she took fire in the cook's galley. The crew and passengers\r\nsubdued the flames after desperate efforts; but their only food\r\nthenceforth was dry biscuit. Off the coast of Cape Breton another gale\r\nrose. They lost their reckoning and lay tossing blindly amid the tempest.\r\nThe exhausted sailors took, in despair, to their hammocks,\r\nfrom which neither commands nor blows could rouse them,\r\nwhile amid shrieks, tears, prayers, and vows to Heaven, the\r\n\"Auguste\" drove towards the shore, struck, and rolled over\r\non her side. La Corne with six others gained the beach; and\r\ntowards night they saw the ship break asunder, and counted\r\na hundred and fourteen corpses strewn along the sand. Aided\r\nby Indians and by English officers, La Corne made his way\r\non snow-shoes up the St. John, and by a miracle of enduring\r\nhardihood reached Quebec before the end of winter.[859]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 857: _Lévis à Belleisle, 27 Nov. 1760_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 858: Faillon, _Vie de Mademoiselle Le Ber_, 363-370.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 859: _Journal du Voyage de M. Saint-Luc de la Corne_. This is his\r\nown narrative.]\r\n\r\nThe other ships weathered the November gales, and landed\r\ntheir passengers on the shores of France, where some of them\r\nfound a dismal welcome, being seized and thrown into the\r\nBastille. These were Vaudreuil, Bigot, Cadet, Péan, Bréard,\r\nVarin, Le Mercier, Penisseault, Maurin, Corpron, and others\r\naccused of the frauds and peculations that had helped to ruin\r\nCanada. In the next year they were all put on trial, whether\r\nas an act of pure justice or as a device to turn public indignation\r\nfrom the Government. In December, 1761, judges commissioned\r\nfor the purpose began their sessions at the Châtelet, and a\r\nprodigious mass of evidence was laid before them. Cadet, with\r\nbrazen effrontery, at first declared himself innocent, but ended\r\nwith full and unblushing confession. Bigot denied everything till\r\nsilenced point by point with papers bearing his own signature.\r\nThe prisoners defended themselves by accusing each other. Bigot\r\nand Vaudreuil brought mutual charges, while all agreed in denouncing\r\nCadet. Vaudreuil, as before mentioned, was acquitted. Bigot was banished\r\nfrom France for life, his property was confiscated, and he was condemned\r\nto pay fifteen hundred thousand francs by way of restitution. Cadet was\r\nbanished for nine years from Paris and required to refund six millions;\r\nwhile others were sentenced in sums varying from thirty thousand to\r\neight hundred thousand francs, and were ordered to be held in prison\r\ntill the money was paid. Of twenty-one persons brought to trial ten\r\nwere condemned, six were acquitted, three received an admonition,\r\nand two were dismissed for want of evidence. Thirty-four failed to appear,\r\nof whom seven were sentenced in default, and judgment was reserved in\r\nthe case of the rest.[860] Even those who escaped from justice profited\r\nlittle by their gains, for unless they had turned them betimes into land\r\nor other substantial values, they lost them in a discredited paper\r\ncurrency and dishonored bills of exchange.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 860: _Jugement rendu souverainement et en dernier Ressort dans\r\nl'Affaire du Canada_. Papers at the Châtelet of Paris, cited by\r\nDussieux.]\r\n\r\nWhile on the American continent the last scenes of the war\r\nwere drawing to their close, the contest raged in Europe with\r\nunabated violence. England was in the full career of success;\r\nbut her great ally, Frederic of Prussia, seemed tottering to his\r\nruin. In the summer of 1758 his glory was at its height.\r\nFrench, Austrians, and Russians had all fled before him. But\r\nthe autumn brought reverses; and the Austrian general, Daun,\r\nat the head of an overwhelming force, gained over him a\r\npartial victory, which his masterly strategy robbed of its\r\nfruits. It was but a momentary respite. His kingdom was exhausted\r\nby its own triumphs. His best generals were dead, his best soldiers\r\nkilled or disabled, his resources almost spent, the very chandeliers\r\nof his palace melted into coin; and all Europe was in arms against him.\r\nThe disciplined valor of the Prussian troops and the supreme leadership\r\nof their undespairing King had thus far held the invading hosts at bay;\r\nbut now the end seemed near. Frederic could not be everywhere at once;\r\nand while he stopped one leak the torrent poured in at another.\r\nThe Russians advanced again, defeated General Wedell, whom\r\nhe sent against them, and made a junction with the Austrians.\r\nIn August, 1759, he attacked their united force at Kunersdorf,\r\nbroke their left wing to pieces, took a hundred and eighty\r\ncannon, forced their centre to give ground, and after hours of\r\nfurious fighting was overwhelmed at last. In vain he tried to\r\nstop the rout. The bullets killed two horses under him, tore his\r\nclothes, and crushed a gold snuff-box in his waistcoat pocket.\r\n\"Is there no b---- of a shot that can hit me, then?\" he cried\r\nin his bitterness, as his aides-de-camp forced him from the\r\nfield. For a few days he despaired; then rallied to his forlorn\r\ntask, and with smiles on his lip and anguish at his heart\r\nwatched, manoeuvred, and fought with cool and stubborn desperation.\r\nTo his friend D'Argens he wrote soon after his defeat: \"Death is sweet\r\nin comparison to such a life as mine. Have pity on me and it; believe\r\nthat I still keep to myself a great many evil things, not wishing to\r\nafflict or disgust anybody with them, and that I would not counsel\r\nyou to fly these unlucky countries if I had any ray of hope; Adieu,\r\nmon cher!\" It was well for him and for Prussia that he had strong allies in\r\nthe dissensions and delays of his enemies. But his cup was not\r\nyet full. Dresden was taken from him, eight of his remaining\r\ngenerals and twelve thousand men were defeated and captured\r\nat Maxen, and \"this infernal campaign,\" as he calls it, closed\r\nin thick darkness.\r\n\r\n\"I wrap myself in my stoicism as best I can,\" he writes to\r\nVoltaire. \"If you saw me you would hardly know me: I am\r\nold, broken, gray-headed, wrinkled. If this goes on there will\r\nbe nothing left of me but the mania of making verses and an\r\ninviolable attachment to my duties and to the few virtuous\r\nmen I know. But you will not get a peace signed by my hand\r\nexcept on conditions honorable to my nation. Your people,\r\nblown up with conceit and folly, may depend on this.\"\r\n\r\nThe same stubborn conflict with overmastering odds, the\r\nsame intrepid resolution, the same subtle strategy, the same\r\nskill in eluding the blow and lightning-like quickness in retorting\r\nit, marked Frederic's campaign of 1760. At Liegnitz three\r\narmies, each equal to his own, closed round him, and he put\r\nthem all to flight. While he was fighting in Silesia, the Allies\r\nmarched upon Berlin, took it, and held it three days, but\r\nwithdrew on his approach. For him there was no peace. \"Why\r\nweary you with the details of my labors and my sorrows?\"\r\nhe wrote again to his faithful D'Argens. \"My spirits have\r\nforsaken me; all gayety is buried with the loved noble ones to\r\nwhom my heart was bound.\" He had lost his mother and his\r\ndevoted sister Wilhelmina. \"You as a follower of Epicurus\r\nput a value upon life; as for me, I regard death from the Stoic\r\npoint of view. I have told you, and I repeat it, never shall my\r\nhand sign a humiliating peace. Finish this campaign I will,\r\nresolved to dare all, to succeed, or find a glorious end.\" Then\r\ncame the victory of Torgau, the last and one of the most\r\ndesperate of his battles: a success dearly bought, and bringing\r\nneither rest nor safety. Once more he wrote to D'Argens:\r\n\"Adieu, dear Marquis; write to me sometimes. Don't forget a\r\npoor devil who curses his fatal existence ten times a day.\"\r\n\"I live like a military monk. Endless business, and a little consolation\r\nfrom my books. I don't know if I shall outlive this war, but if I do\r\nI am firmly resolved to pass the rest of my life in solitude in the\r\nbosom of philosophy and friendship. Your nation, you see, is blinder\r\nthan you thought. These fools will lose their Canada and Pondicherry\r\nto please the Queen of Hungary and the Czarina.\"\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1761 was mainly defensive on the part of\r\nFrederic. In the exhaustion of his resources he could see no\r\nmeans of continuing the struggle. \"It is only Fortune,\" says\r\nthe royal sceptic, \"that can extricate me from the situation\r\nI am in. I escape out of it by looking at the universe on the\r\ngreat scale like an observer from some distant planet. All then\r\nseems to be so infinitely small that I could almost pity my\r\nenemies for giving themselves so much trouble about so very\r\nlittle. I read a great deal, I devour my books. But for them\r\nI think hypochondria would have had me in Bedlam before\r\nnow. In fine, dear Marquis, we live in troublous times and\r\ndesperate situations. I have all the properties of a stage hero;\r\nalways in danger, always on the point of perishing.\"[861] And in\r\nanother mood: \"I begin to feel that, as the Italians say, revenge\r\nis a pleasure for the gods. My philosophy is worn out by\r\nsuffering. I am no saint, and I will own that I should die content\r\nif only I could first inflict a part of the misery that I\r\nendure.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 861: The above extracts are as translated by Carlyle in his\r\n_History of Frederick II. of Prussia_.]\r\n\r\nWhile Frederic was fighting for life and crown, an event\r\ntook place in England that was to have great influence on the\r\nwar. Walpole recounts it thus, writing to George Montagu on\r\nthe twenty-fifth of October, 1760: \"My man Harry tells me\r\nall the amusing news. He first told me of the late Prince of\r\nWales's death, and to-day of the King's; so I must tell you all\r\nI know of departed majesty. He went to bed well last night,\r\nrose at six this morning as usual, looked, I suppose, if all his\r\nmoney was in his purse, and called for his chocolate. A little\r\nafter seven he went into the closet; the German _valet-de-chambre_\r\nheard a noise, listened, heard something like a groan, ran in, and\r\nfound the hero of Oudenarde and Dettingen on the floor with a gash\r\non his right temple by falling against the corner of a bureau. He\r\ntried to speak, could not, and expired. The great ventricle of the\r\nheart had burst. What an enviable death!\"\r\n\r\nThe old King was succeeded by his grandson, George III.,\r\na mirror of domestic virtues, conscientious, obstinate, narrow.\r\nHis accession produced political changes that had been preparing\r\nfor some time. His grandfather was German at heart, loved his\r\nContinental kingdom of Hanover, and was eager for all measures that\r\nlooked to its defence and preservation. Pitt, too, had of late\r\nvigorously supported the Continental war, saying that he would conquer\r\nAmerica in Germany. Thus with different views the King and the Minister\r\nhad concurred in the same measures. But George III. was English by\r\nbirth, language, and inclination. His ruling passion was the\r\nestablishment and increase of his own authority. He disliked Pitt, the\r\nrepresentative of the people. He was at heart averse to a war,\r\nthe continuance of which would make the Great Commoner necessary,\r\nand therefore powerful, and he wished for a peace that would give\r\nfree scope to his schemes for strengthening the prerogative. He was\r\nnot alone in his pacific inclinations. The enemies of the haughty\r\nMinister, who had ridden roughshod over men far above him in rank,\r\nwere tired of his ascendency, and saw no hope of ending it but by ending\r\nthe war. Thus a peace party grew up, and the young King became\r\nits real, though not at first its declared, supporter.\r\n\r\nThe Tory party, long buried, showed signs of resurrection.\r\nThere were those among its members who, even in a king of\r\nthe hated line of Hanover, could recognize and admire the\r\nsame spirit of arbitrary domination that had marked their\r\nfallen idols, the Stuarts; and they now joined hands with the\r\ndiscontented Whigs in opposition to Pitt. The horrors of war,\r\nthe blessings of peace, the weight of taxation, the growth of\r\nthe national debt, were the rallying cries of the new party; but\r\nthe mainspring of their zeal was hostility to the great Minister.\r\nEven his own colleagues chafed under his spirit of mastery;\r\nthe chiefs of the Opposition longed to inherit his power; and\r\nthe King had begun to hate him as a lion in his path. Pitt held\r\nto his purpose regardless of the gathering storm. That purpose,\r\nas proclaimed by his adherents, was to secure a solid and lasting peace,\r\nwhich meant the reduction of France to so low an estate that she\r\ncould no more be a danger to her rival. In this he had the sympathy\r\nof the great body of the nation.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1761 the King, a fanatic for prerogative, set his\r\nenginery in motion. The elections for the new Parliament were\r\nmanipulated in his interest. If he disliked Pitt as the representative\r\nof the popular will, he also disliked his colleague, the\r\nshuffling and uncertain Newcastle, as the representative of a\r\ntoo powerful nobility. Elements hostile to both were introduced into\r\nthe Cabinet and the great offices. The King'sfavorite, the Earl of Bute,\r\nsupplanted Holdernesse as Secretary of State for the Northern Department;\r\nCharles Townshend, an opponent of Pitt, was made Secretary of War; Legge,\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, was replaced by Viscount Barrington, who was\r\nsure for the King; while a place in the Cabinet was also given to the Duke\r\nof Bedford, one of the few men who dared face the formidable Minister.\r\nIt was the policy of the King and his following to abandon Prussia,\r\nhitherto supported by British subsidies, make friends with Austria and\r\nRussia at her expense, and conclude a separate peace with France.\r\n\r\nFrance was in sore need of peace. The infatuation that had\r\nturned her from her own true interest to serve the passions\r\nof Maria Theresa and the Czarina Elizabeth had brought military\r\nhumiliation and financial ruin. Abbé de Bernis, Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs, had lost the favor of Madame de Pompadour, and had been\r\nsupplanted by the Duc de Choiseul. The new Minister had gained his\r\nplace by pleasing the favorite; but he kept it through his own ability\r\nand the necessities of the time. The Englishman Stanley, whom Pitt\r\nsent to negotiate with him, drew this sketch of his character: \"Though\r\nhe may have his superiors, not only in experience of business,\r\nbut in depth and refinement as a statesman, he is a person\r\nof as bold and daring a spirit as any man whatever in our\r\ncountry or in his own. Madame Pompadour has ever been looked upon by\r\nall preceding courtiers and ministers as their tutelary deity, under\r\nwhose auspices only they could exist, and who was as much out of\r\ntheir reach as if she were of a superior class of beings; but this\r\nMinister is so far from being in subordination to her influence that\r\nhe seized the first opportunity of depriving her not of an equality,\r\nbut of any share of power, reducing her to the necessity of applying\r\nto him even for those favors that she wants for herself and her dependents.\r\nHe has effected this great change, which every other man\r\nwould have thought impossible, in the interior of the Court,\r\nnot by plausibility, flattery, and address, but with a high hand,\r\nwith frequent railleries and sarcasms which would have ruined any other,\r\nand, in short, by a clear superiority of spirit and resolution.\"[862]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 862: _Stanley to Pitt, 6 Aug. 1761_, in _Grenville\r\nCorrespondence_, I. 367, _note_.]\r\n\r\nChoiseul was vivacious, brilliant, keen, penetrating; believing\r\nnothing, fearing nothing; an easy moralist, an uncertain\r\nally, a hater of priests; light-minded, inconstant; yet a kind of\r\npatriot, eager to serve France and retrieve her fortunes.\r\n\r\nHe flattered himself with no illusions. \"Since we do not\r\nknow how to make war,\" he said, \"we must make peace;\"[863]\r\nand he proposed a congress of all the belligerent Powers at\r\nAugsburg. At the same time, since the war in Germany was\r\ndistinct from the maritime and colonial war of France and\r\nEngland, he proposed a separate negotiation with the British\r\nCourt in order to settle the questions between them as a\r\npreliminary to the general pacification. Pitt consented, and\r\nStanley went as envoy to Versailles; while M. de Bussy came\r\nas envoy to London and, in behalf of Choiseul, offered terms\r\nof peace, the first of which was the entire abandonment of\r\nCanada to England.[864] But the offers were accompanied by the\r\ndemand that Spain, which had complaints of its own against\r\nEngland, should be admitted as a party to the negotiation, and\r\neven hold in some measure the attitude of a mediator. Pitt\r\nspurned the idea with fierce contempt. \"Time enough to treat\r\nof all that, sir, when the Tower of London is taken sword in\r\nhand.\"[865] He bore his part with the ability that never failed him,\r\nand with a supreme arrogance that rose to a climax in his\r\ndemand that the fortress of Dunkirk should be demolished, not\r\nbecause it was any longer dangerous to England, but because\r\nthe nation would regard its destruction \"as an eternal monument\r\nof the yoke imposed on France.\"[866]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 863:\r\nFlassan, _Diplomatie Française_, V. 376 (Paris, 1809).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 864: See the proposals in Entick, V. 161.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 865:\r\nBeatson, _Military Memoirs_, II. 434. _The Count de Fuentes\r\nto the Earl of Egremont, 25 Dec. 1761_, in Entick, V. 264.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 866:\r\nOn this negotiation, see _Mémoire historique sur la Négociation\r\nde la France et de l'Angleterre_ (Paris, 1761), a French Government\r\npublication containing papers on both sides. The British\r\nMinistry also published such documents as they saw fit, under the\r\ntitle of _Papers relating to the Rupture with Spain_. Compare\r\nAdolphus, _George III._, I. 31-39.]\r\n\r\nChoiseul replied with counter-propositions less humiliating\r\nto his nation. When the question of accepting or rejecting\r\nthem came before the Ministry, the views of Pitt prevailed\r\nby a majority of one, and, to the disappointment of Bute and\r\nthe King, the conferences were broken off. Choiseul, launched\r\nagain on the billows of a disastrous war, had seen and provided\r\nagainst the event. Ferdinand VI. of Spain had died, and\r\nCarlos III. had succeeded to his throne. Here, as in England,\r\nchange of kings brought change of policy. While negotiating\r\nvainly with Pitt, the French Minister had negotiated secretly\r\nand successfully with Carlos; and the result was the treaty\r\nknown as the Family Compact, having for its object the union\r\nof the various members of the House of Bourbon in common\r\nresistance to the growing power of England. It provided that\r\nin any future war the Kings of France and Spain should act\r\nas one towards foreign Powers, insomuch that the enemy of\r\neither should be the enemy of both; and the Bourbon princes\r\nof Italy were invited to join in the covenant.[867] What was more\r\nto the present purpose, a special agreement was concluded on\r\nthe same day, by which Spain bound herself to declare war\r\nagainst England unless that Power should make peace with\r\nFrance before the first of May, 1762. For the safety of her\r\ncolonies and her trade Spain felt it her interest to join her\r\nsister nation in putting a check on the vast expansion of\r\nBritish maritime power. She could bring a hundred ships of war\r\nto aid the dilapidated navy of France, and the wealth of the\r\nIndies to aid her ruined treasury.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 867:\r\nFlassan, _Diplomatie Française_, V. 317 (Paris, 1809).]\r\n\r\nPitt divined the secret treaty, and soon found evidence of\r\nit. He resolved to demand at once full explanation from\r\nSpain; and, failing to receive a satisfactory reply, attack her\r\nat home and abroad before she was prepared. On the second\r\nof October he laid his plan before a Cabinet Council held at\r\na house in St. James Street. There were present the Earl of\r\nBute, the Duke of Newcastle, Earl Granville, Earl Temple,\r\nand others of the Ministry. Pitt urged his views with great\r\nwarmth. \"This,\" he exclaimed, \"is the time for humbling the\r\nwhole House of Bourbon!\"[868] His brother-in-law, Temple, supported\r\nhim. Newcastle kept silent. Bute denounced the proposal,\r\nand the rest were of his mind. \"If these views are to be followed,\"\r\nsaid Pitt, \"this is the last time I can sit at this board. I was\r\ncalled to the administration of affairs by the voice of the people;\r\nto them I have always considered myself as accountable for my conduct;\r\nand therefore cannot remain in a situation which makes me responsible\r\nfor measures I am no longer allowed to guide.\" Nothing could be more\r\noffensive to George III. and his adherents.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 868: Beatson, II. 438.]\r\n\r\nThe veteran Carteret, Earl Granville, replied angrily: \"I\r\nfind the gentleman is determined to leave us; nor can I say I\r\nam sorry for it, since otherwise he would certainly have compelled\r\nus to leave him. But if he is resolved to assume the office of\r\nexclusively advising His Majesty and directing the operations of the\r\nwar, to what purpose are we called to this council? When he talks of\r\nbeing responsible to the people, he talks the language of the House\r\nof Commons, and forgets that at this board he is responsible only\r\nto the King. However, though he may possibly have convinced himself\r\nof his infallibility, still it remains that we should be equally\r\nconvinced before we can resign our understandings to his direction,\r\nor join with him in the measure he proposes.\"[869]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 869: _Annual Register, 1761_, p. 44. Adolphus, _George III._,\r\nI. 40. Thackeray, _Life of Chatham_, I. 592.]\r\n\r\nPitt resigned, and his colleagues rejoiced.[870] Power fell to\r\nBute and the Tories; and great was the fall. The mass of the\r\nnation was with the defeated Minister. On Lord Mayor's Day\r\nBute and Barrington were passing St. Paul's in a coach, which\r\nthe crowd mistook for that of Pitt, and cheered lustily; till\r\none man, looking in at the window, shouted to the rest: \"This\r\nisn't Pitt; it's Bute, and be damned to him!\" The cheers\r\nturned forthwith to hisses, mixed with cries of \"No Bute!\"\r\n\"No Newcastle salmon!\" \"Pitt forever!\" Handfuls of mud were showered\r\nagainst the coach, and Barrington's ruffles were besmirched with\r\nit.[871]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 870: Walpole, _George III._, I. 80, and note by Sir Denis Le\r\nMarchant, 80-82.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 871: _Nuthall to Lady Chatham, 12 Nov. 1761_, in _Chatham\r\nCorrespondence_, II. 166.]\r\n\r\nThe fall of Pitt was like the knell of doom to Frederic of\r\nPrussia. It meant abandonment by his only ally, and the loss\r\nof the subsidy which was his chief resource. The darkness\r\naround him grew darker yet, and not a hope seemed left;\r\nwhen as by miracle the clouds broke, and light streamed out\r\nof the blackness. The bitterest of his foes, the Czarina Elizabeth,\r\nshe whom he had called _infâme catin du Nord_, died, and was\r\nsucceeded by her nephew, Peter III. Here again, as in England and\r\nSpain, a new sovereign brought new measures. The young Czar, simple\r\nand enthusiastic, admired the King of Prussia, thought him the\r\nparagon of heroes, and proclaimed himself his friend. No sooner\r\nwas he on the throne than Russia changed front. From the foe of\r\nFrederic she became his ally; and in the opening campaign of 1762\r\nthe army that was to have aided in crushing him was ranged on his\r\nside. It was a turn of fortune too sharp and sudden to endure.\r\nIll-balanced and extreme in all things, Peter plunged into\r\nheadlong reforms, exasperated the clergy and the army, and\r\nalienated his wife, Catherine, who had hoped to rule in his\r\nname, and who now saw herself supplanted by his mistress.\r\nWithin six months he was deposed and strangled. Catherine,\r\none of whose lovers had borne part in the murder, reigned\r\nin his stead, conspicuous by the unbridled disorders of her\r\nlife, and by powers of mind that mark her as the ablest of\r\nfemale sovereigns. If she did not share her husband's enthusiasm\r\nfor Frederic, neither did she share Elizabeth's hatred of him.\r\nHe, on his part, taught by hard experience, conciliated instead of\r\ninsulting her, and she let him alone.\r\n\r\nPeace with Russia brought peace with Sweden, and Austria\r\nwith the Germanic Empire stood alone against him. France\r\nneeded all her strength to hold her own against the mixed\r\nEnglish and German force under Ferdinand of Brunswick in\r\nthe Rhine countries. She made spasmodic efforts to seize upon\r\nHanover, but the result was humiliating defeat.\r\n\r\nIn England George III. pursued his policy of strengthening\r\nthe prerogative, and, jealous of the Whig aristocracy, attacked\r\nit in the person of Newcastle. In vain the old politician\r\nhad played false with Pitt, and trimmed to please his young\r\nmaster. He was worried into resigning his place in the Cabinet,\r\nand Bute, the obsequious agent of the royal will, succeeded\r\nhim as First Lord of the Treasury. Into his weak and unwilling hands\r\nnow fell the task of carrying on the war; for the nation, elated\r\nwith triumphs and full of fight, still called on its rulers for\r\nfresh efforts and fresh victories. Pitt had proved a true prophet,\r\nand his enemies were put to shame; for the attitude of Spain forced\r\nBute and his colleagues to the open rupture with her which the great\r\nMinister had vainly urged upon them; and a new and formidable war was\r\nnow added to the old.[872] Their counsels were weak and half-hearted;\r\nbut the armies and navies of England still felt the impulsion that\r\nthe imperial hand of Pitt had given and the unconquerable spirit that\r\nhe had roused.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 872:\r\n_Declaration of War against the King of Spain, 4 Jan. 1762._]\r\n\r\nThis spirit had borne them from victory to victory. In Asia\r\nthey had driven the French from Pondicherry and all their\r\nIndian possessions; in Africa they had wrested from them\r\nGorée and the Senegal country; in the West Indies they had\r\ntaken Guadeloupe and Dominica; in the European seas they\r\nhad captured ship after ship, routed and crippled the great\r\nfleet of Admiral Conflans, seized Belleisle, and defeated a bold\r\nattempt to invade Ireland. The navy of France was reduced\r\nto helplessness. Pitt, before his resignation, had planned a\r\nseries of new operations, including an attack on Martinique,\r\nwith other West Indian islands still left to France, and then\r\nin turn on the Spanish possessions of Havana, Panama, Manila, and\r\nthe Philippines. Now, more than ever before, the war appeared in\r\nits true character. It was a contest for maritime and colonial\r\nascendency; and England saw herself confronted by both her great\r\nrivals at once.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Rodney sailed for Martinique, and Brigadier\r\nMonckton joined him with troops from America. Before the\r\nmiddle of February the whole island was in their hands; and\r\nGrenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent soon shared its fate. The\r\nEarl of Albemarle and Admiral Sir George Pococke sailed in\r\nearly spring on a more important errand, landed in June near\r\nHavana with eleven thousand soldiers, and attacked Moro Castle,\r\nthe key of the city. The pitiless sun of the tropic midsummer\r\npoured its fierce light and heat on the parched rocks where the men\r\ntoiled at the trenches. Earth was so scarce that hardly enough could\r\nbe had to keep the fascines in place. The siege works were little\r\nelse than a mass of dry faggots; and when, after exhausting toil,\r\nthe grand battery opened on the Spanish defences, it presently took\r\nfire, was consumed, and had to be made anew. Fresh water failed,\r\nand the troops died by scores from thirst; fevers set in, killed\r\nmany, and disabled nearly half the army. The sea was strewn with\r\nfloating corpses, and carrion-birds in clouds hovered over the populous\r\ngraveyards and infected camps. Yet the siege went on: a formidable\r\nsally was repulsed; Moro Castle was carried by storm; till at length,\r\ntwo months and eight days after the troops landed, Havana fell into\r\ntheir hands.[873] At the same time Spain was attacked at the antipodes,\r\nand the loss of Manila and the Philippines gave her fresh cause to\r\nrepent her rash compact with France. She was hardly more fortunate\r\nnear home; for having sent an army to invade Portugal, whichwas in\r\nthe interest of England, a small British force, under Brigadier\r\nBurgoyne, foiled it, and forced it to retire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 873: _Journal of the Siege, by the Chief Engineer, in Beatson_,\r\nII. 544. Mante, 398-465. Entick, V. 363-383.]\r\n\r\nThe tide of British success was checked for an instant in\r\nNewfoundland, where a French squadron attacked St. John's\r\nand took it, with its garrison of sixty men. The news reached\r\nAmherst at New York; his brother, Lieutenant-Colonel Amherst,\r\nwas sent to the scene of the mishap. St. John's was retaken, and\r\nits late conquerers were made prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nThe financial condition of France was desperate. Her people\r\nwere crushed with taxation; her debt grew apace; and her\r\nyearly expenditure was nearly double her revenue. Choiseul\r\nfelt the need of immediate peace; and George III. and Bute\r\nwere hardly less eager for it, to avert the danger of Pitt's return\r\nto power and give free scope to their schemes for strengthening the\r\nprerogative. Therefore, in September, 1762, negotiations were resumed.\r\nThe Duke of Bedford was sent to Paris to settle the preliminaries,\r\nand the Duc de Nivernois came to London on the same errand. The\r\npopulace were still for war. Bedford was hissed as he passed through\r\nthe streets of London, and a mob hooted at the puny figure of Nivernois\r\nas he landed at Dover.\r\n\r\nThe great question was, Should Canada be restored? Should\r\nFrance still be permitted to keep a foothold on the North\r\nAmerican continent? Ever since the capitulation of Montreal\r\na swarm of pamphlets had discussed the momentous subject.\r\nSome maintained that the acquisition of Canada was not an\r\noriginal object of the war; that the colony was of little value\r\nand ought to be given back to its old masters; that Guadeloupe\r\nshould be kept instead, the sugar trade of that island being worth far\r\nmore than the Canadian fur trade; and, lastly, that the British colonists,\r\nif no longer held in check by France, would spread themselves over\r\nthe continent, learn to supply all their own wants, grow independent,\r\nand become dangerous. Nor were these views confined to Englishmen.\r\nThere were foreign observers who clearly saw that the adhesion\r\nof her colonies to Great Britain would be jeopardized by the extinction\r\nof French power in America. Choiseul warned Stanley that they \"would\r\nnot fail to shake off their dependence the moment Canada should be\r\nceded;\" while thirteen years before, the Swedish traveller Kalm declared\r\nthat the presence of the French in America gave the best assurance to\r\nGreat Britain that its own colonies would remain in due subjection.[874]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 874: Kalm, _Travels in North America_, I. 207.]\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy argument on the other side was that\r\nof Franklin, whose words find a strange commentary in the\r\nevents of the next few years. He affirmed that the colonies\r\nwere so jealous of each other that they would never unite\r\nagainst England. \"If they could not agree to unite against\r\nthe French and Indians, can it reasonably be supposed that\r\nthere is any danger of their uniting against their own nation,\r\nwhich it is well known they all love much more than they\r\nlove one another? I will venture to say union amongst them\r\nfor such a purpose is not merely improbable, it is impossible;\"\r\nthat is, he prudently adds, without \"the most grievous tyranny\r\nand oppression,\" like the bloody rule of \"Alva in the Netherlands.\"[875]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 875: _Interest of Great Britain in regard to her Colonies_\r\n(London, 1760)\r\n\r\nLord Bath argues for retaining Canada in _A Letter addressed\r\nto Two Great Men on the Prospect of Peace_ (1759). He is answered\r\nby another pamphlet called _Remarks on the Letter to Two Great\r\nMen_ (1760). The _Gentleman's Magazine_ for 1759 has an ironical\r\narticle styled _Reasons for restoring Canada to the French_; and\r\nin 1761 a pamphlet against the restitution appeared under the\r\ntitle, _Importance of Canada considered in Two Letters to a Noble\r\nLord_. These are but a part of the writings on the question.]\r\n\r\nIf Pitt had been in office he would have demanded terms\r\nthat must ruin past redemption the maritime and colonial\r\npower of France; but Bute was less exacting. In November\r\nthe plenipotentiaries of England, France, and Spain agreed\r\non preliminaries of peace, in which the following were the\r\nessential points. France ceded to Great Britain Canada and\r\nall her possessions on the North American continent east of\r\nthe River Mississippi, except the city of New Orleans and a small\r\nadjacent district. She renounced her claims to Acadia, and gave up\r\nto the conqueror the Island of Cape Breton, with all other islands\r\nin the Gulf and River of St. Lawrence. Spain received back Havana,\r\nand paid for it by the cession of Florida, with all her other\r\npossessions east of the Mississippi. France, subject to certain\r\nrestrictions, was left free to fish in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and\r\noff a part of the coast of Newfoundland; and the two little islands\r\nof St. Pierre and Miquelon were given her as fishing stations on\r\ncondition that she should not fortify or garrison them. In the West\r\nIndies, England restored the captured islands of Guadeloupe, Marigalante,\r\nDésirade, and Martinique, and France ceded Grenada and the Grenadines;\r\nwhile it was agreed that of the so-called neutral islands, St. Vincent,\r\nDominica, and Tobago should belong to England, and St. Lucia to France.\r\nIn Europe, each side promised to give no more help to its allies in the\r\nGerman war. France restored Minorca, and England restored Belleisle;\r\nFrance gave up such parts of Hanoverian territory as she had\r\noccupied, and evacuated certain fortresses belonging to Prussia,\r\npledging herself at the same time to demolish, under the\r\ninspection of English engineers, her own maritime fortress\r\nof Dunkirk. In Africa France ceded Senegal, and received\r\nback the small Island of Gorée. In India she lost everything\r\nshe had gained since the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle; recovered\r\ncertain trading stations, but renounced the right of building\r\nforts or maintaining troops in Bengal.\r\n\r\nOn the day when the preliminaries were signed, France\r\nmade a secret agreement with Spain, by which she divested\r\nherself of the last shred of her possessions on the North\r\nAmerican continent. As compensation for Florida, which her\r\nluckless ally had lost in her quarrel, she made over to the\r\nSpanish Crown the city of New Orleans, and under the name\r\nof Louisiana gave her the vast region spreading westward\r\nfrom the Mississippi towards the Pacific.\r\n\r\nOn the ninth of December the question of approving the\r\npreliminaries came up before both Houses of Parliament.\r\nThere was a long debate in the Commons. Pitt was not present,\r\nconfined, it was said, by gout; till late in the day the\r\nHouse was startled by repeated cheers from the outside. The\r\ndoors opened, and the fallen Minister entered, carried in the\r\narms of his servants, and followed by an applauding crowd.\r\nHis bearers set him down within the bar, and by the help of\r\na crutch he made his way with difficulty to his seat. \"There\r\nwas a mixture of the very solemn and the theatric in this apparition,\"\r\nsays Walpole, who was present. \"The moment was so well timed, the\r\nimportance of the man and his services, the languor of his emaciated\r\ncountenance, and the study bestowed on his dress were circumstances\r\nthat struck solemnity into a patriot mind, and did a little furnish\r\nridicule to the hardened and insensible. He was dressed in black\r\nvelvet, his legs and thighs wrapped in flannel, his feet covered with\r\nbuskins of black cloth, and his hands with thick gloves.\" Not\r\nfor the first time, he was utilizing his maladies for purposes\r\nof stage effect. He spoke for about three hours, sometimes\r\nstanding, and sometimes seated; sometimes with a brief burst\r\nof power, more often with the accents of pain and exhaustion.\r\nHe highly commended the retention of Canada, but denounced\r\nthe leaving to France a share in the fisheries, as well as other\r\nadvantages tending to a possible revival of her maritime\r\npower. But the Commons listened coldly, and by a great majority approved\r\nthe preliminaries of peace.\r\n\r\nThese preliminaries were embodied in the definitive treaty\r\nconcluded at Paris on the tenth of February, 1763. Peace between\r\nFrance and England brought peace between the warring nations of the\r\nContinent. Austria, bereft of her allies, and exhausted by vain efforts\r\nto crush Frederic, gave up the attempt in despair, and signed the treaty\r\nof Hubertsburg. The Seven Years War was ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 32\r\n\r\n1763-1884\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said Earl Granville on his deathbed, \"has been the\r\nmost glorious war and the most triumphant peace that England\r\never knew.\" Not all were so well pleased, and many held\r\nwith Pitt that the House of Bourbon should have been forced\r\nto drain the cup of humiliation to the dregs. Yet the fact\r\nremains that the Peace of Paris marks an epoch than which\r\nnone in modern history is more fruitful of grand results. With\r\nit began a new chapter in the annals of the world. To borrow\r\nthe words of a late eminent writer, \"It is no exaggeration to\r\nsay that three of the many victories of the Seven Years War\r\ndetermined for ages to come the destinies of mankind. With\r\nthat of Rossbach began the re-creation of Germany, with that\r\nof Plassey the influence of Europe told for the first time since\r\nthe days of Alexander on the nations of the East; with the\r\ntriumph of Wolfe on the Heights of Abraham began the history of\r\nthe United States.\"[876]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 876: Green, _History of the English People_, IV. 193\r\n(London, 1880).]\r\n\r\nSo far, however, as concerns the war in the Germanic\r\ncountries, it was to outward seeming but a mad debauch of\r\nblood and rapine, ending in nothing but the exhaustion of the\r\ncombatants. The havoc had been frightful. According to the\r\nKing of Prussia's reckoning, 853,000 soldiers of the various\r\nnations had lost their lives, besides hundreds of thousands of\r\nnon-combatants who had perished from famine, exposure, disease, or\r\nviolence. And with all this waste of life not a boundary line had been\r\nchanged. The rage of the two empresses and the vanity and spite of the\r\nconcubine had been completely foiled. Frederic had defied them all,\r\nand had come out of the strife intact in his own hereditary dominions\r\nand master of all that he had snatched from the Empress-Queen;\r\nwhile Prussia, portioned out by her enemies as their spoil, lay depleted\r\nindeed, and faint with deadly striving, but crowned with glory, and with\r\nthe career before her which, through tribulation and adversity, was to\r\nlead her at last to the headship of a united Germany.\r\n\r\nThrough centuries of strife and vicissitude the French\r\nmonarchy had triumphed over nobles, parliaments, and people,\r\ngathered to itself all the forces of the State, beamed with\r\nillusive splendors under Louis the Great, and shone with the\r\nphosphorescence of decay under his contemptible successor;\r\ntill now, robbed of prestige, burdened with debt, and mined\r\nwith corruption, it was moving swiftly and more swiftly towards\r\nthe abyss of ruin.\r\n\r\nWhile the war hastened the inevitable downfall of the\r\nFrench monarchy, it produced still more notable effects.\r\nFrance under Colbert had embarked on a grand course of maritime\r\nand colonial enterprise, and followed it with an activity and vigor\r\nthat promised to make her a great and formidable ocean power. It was\r\nshe who led the way in the East, first trained the natives to fight\r\nher battles, and began that system of mixed diplomacy and war which,\r\nimitated by her rival, enabled a handful of Europeans to master all\r\nIndia. In North America her vast possessions dwarfed those of every\r\nother nation. She had built up a powerful navy and created an extensive\r\nforeign trade. All this was now changed. In India she was reduced to\r\nhelpless inferiority, with total ruin in the future; and of all her\r\nboundless territories in North America nothing was left but the two\r\nisland rocks on the coast of Newfoundland that the victors had given\r\nher for drying her codfish. Of her navy scarcely forty ships remained;\r\nall the rest were captured or destroyed. She was still great on the\r\ncontinent of Europe, but as a world power her grand opportunities\r\nwere gone.\r\n\r\nIn England as in France the several members of the State\r\nhad battled together since the national life began, and the\r\nresult had been, not the unchecked domination of the Crown,\r\nbut a system of balanced and adjusted forces, in which King,\r\nNobility, and Commons all had their recognized places and\r\ntheir share of power. Thus in the war just ended two great\r\nconditions of success had been supplied: a people instinct\r\nwith the energies of ordered freedom, and a masterly leadership\r\nto inspire and direct them.\r\n\r\nAll, and more than all, that France had lost England had\r\nwon. Now, for the first time, she was beyond dispute the\r\ngreatest of maritime and colonial Powers. Portugal and Holland,\r\nher precursors in ocean enterprise, had long ago fallen\r\nhopelessly behind. Two great rivals remained, and she had\r\nhumbled the one and swept the other from her path. Spain,\r\nwith vast American possessions, was sinking into the decay\r\nwhich is one of the phenomena of modern history; while France, of\r\nlate a most formidable competitor, had abandoned the contest in\r\ndespair. England was mistress of the seas, and the world was thrown\r\nopen to her merchants, explorers, and colonists. A few years after\r\nthe Peace the navigator Cook began his memorable series of voyages,\r\nand surveyed the strange and barbarous lands which after times were\r\nto transform into other Englands, vigorous children of this great\r\nmother of nations. It is true that a heavy blow was soon to fall\r\nupon her; her own folly was to alienate the eldest and greatest\r\nof her offspring. But nothing could rob her of the glory of\r\ngiving birth to the United States; and, though politically\r\nsevered, this gigantic progeny were to be not the less a source\r\nof growth and prosperity to the parent that bore them, joined\r\nwith her in a triple kinship of laws, language, and blood. The\r\nwar or series of wars that ended with the Peace of Paris\r\nsecured the opportunities and set in action the forces that have\r\nplanted English homes in every clime, and dotted the earth\r\nwith English garrisons and posts of trade.\r\n\r\nWith the Peace of Paris ended the checkered story of New\r\nFrance; a story which would have been a history if faults of\r\nconstitution and the bigotry and folly of rulers had not dwarfed\r\nit to an episode. Yet it is a noteworthy one in both its lights\r\nand its shadows: in the disinterested zeal of the founder of\r\nQuebec, the self-devotion of the early missionary martyrs, and\r\nthe daring enterprise of explorers; in the spiritual and temporal\r\nvassalage from which the only escape was to the savagery\r\nof the wilderness; and in the swarming corruptions which were\r\nthe natural result of an attempt to rule, by the absolute hand\r\nof a master beyond the Atlantic, a people bereft of every\r\nvestige of civil liberty. Civil liberty was given them by the\r\nBritish sword; but the conqueror left their religious system untouched,\r\nand through it they have imposed upon themselves a weight of\r\necclesiastical tutelage that finds few equals in the most Catholic\r\ncountries of Europe. Such guardianship is not without certain\r\nadvantages. When faithfully exercised it aids to uphold some of the\r\ntamer virtues, if that can be called a virtue which needs the constant\r\npresence of a sentinel to keep it from escaping: but it is fatal to\r\nmental robustness and moral courage; and if French Canada would fulfil\r\nits aspirations it must cease to be one of the most priest-ridden\r\ncommunities of the modern world.\r\n\r\nScarcely were they free from the incubus of France when\r\nthe British provinces showed symptoms of revolt. The measures\r\non the part of the mother-country which roused their resentment,\r\nfar from being oppressive, were less burdensome than the navigation\r\nlaws to which they had long submitted; and they resisted taxation by\r\nParliament simply because it was in principle opposed to their rights\r\nas freemen. They did not, like the American provinces of Spain at a\r\nlater day, sunder themselves from a parent fallen into decrepitude; but\r\nwith astonishing audacity they affronted the wrath of England\r\nin the hour of her triumph, forgot their jealousies and quarrels,\r\njoined hands in the common cause, fought, endured, and won. The disunited\r\ncolonies became the United States. The string of discordant communities\r\nalong the Atlantic coast has grown to a mighty people, joined in a union\r\nwhich the earthquake of civil war served only to compact and consolidate.\r\nThose who in the weakness of their dissensions needed help\r\nfrom England against the savage on their borders have become\r\na nation that may defy every foe but that most dangerous\r\nof all foes, herself, destined to a majestic future if she will\r\nshun the excess and perversion of the principles that made her\r\ngreat, prate less about the enemies of the past and strive more\r\nagainst the enemies of the present, resist the mob and the\r\ndemagogue as she resisted Parliament and King, rally her\r\npowers from the race for gold and the delirium of prosperity\r\nto make firm the foundations on which that prosperity rests,\r\nand turn some fair proportion of her vast mental forces to\r\nother objects than material progress and the game of party\r\npolitics. She has tamed the savage continent, peopled the\r\nsolitude, gathered wealth untold, waxed potent, imposing, redoubtable;\r\nand now it remains for her to prove, if she can, that the rule of the\r\nmasses is consistent with the highest growth of the individual; that\r\ndemocracy can give the world a civilization as mature and pregnant,\r\nideas as energetic and vitalizing, and types of manhood as lofty and\r\nstrong, as any of the systems which it boasts to supplant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix A\r\n\r\nChapter 3.

Washington\r\n\r\n\r\n_Washington and the Capitulation at Fort Necessity_.--Villiers,\r\nin his Journal, boasts that he made Washington sign a virtual\r\nadmission that he had assassinated Jumonville. In regard to this\r\npoint, a letter, of which the following is an extract, is printed in\r\nthe provincial papers of the time. It is from Captain Adam\r\nStephen, an officer in the action, writing to a friend five weeks\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n\"When Mr. Vanbraam returned with the French proposals, we\r\nwere obliged to take the sense of them from his mouth; it rained\r\nso heavy that he could not give us a written translation of them;\r\nwe could scarcely keep the candle lighted to read them by; they\r\nwere written in a bad hand, on wet and blotted paper, so that\r\nno person could read them but Vanbraam, who had heard them\r\nfrom the mouth of the French officer. Every officer there is\r\nready to declare that there was no such word as _assassination_\r\nmentioned. The terms expressed were, _the death of Jumonville_. If\r\nit had been mentioned we would by all means have had it altered,\r\nas the French, during the course of the interview, seemed very\r\ncondescending, and desirous to bring things to an issue.\" He then\r\ngives several other points in which Vanbraam had misled them.\r\n\r\nDinwiddie, recounting the affair to Lord Albemarle, says that\r\nWashington, being ignorant of French, was deceived by the\r\ninterpreter, who, through poltroonery, suppressed the word assassination.\r\n\r\nCaptain Mackay, writing to Washington in September, after a\r\nvisit to Philadelphia, says: \"I had several disputes about our\r\ncapitulation; but I satisfied every person that mentioned the subject\r\nas to the articles in question, that they were owing to a bad\r\ninterpreter, and contrary to the translation made to us when we\r\nsigned them.\"\r\n\r\nAt the next meeting of the burgesses they passed a vote of thanks\r\nfor gallant conduct to Washington and all his officers by name,\r\nexcept Vanbraam and the major of the regiment, the latter being\r\ncharged with cowardice, and the former with treacherous misinterpretation\r\nof the articles.\r\n\r\nSometime after, Washington wrote to a correspondent who had\r\nquestioned him on the subject: \"That we were wilfully or ignorantly\r\ndeceived by our interpreter in regard to the word _assassination_\r\nI do aver, and will to my dying moment; so will every officer\r\nthat was present. The interpreter was a Dutchman little acquainted\r\nwith the English tongue, therefore might not advert to the tone and\r\nmeaning of the word in English; but, whatever his motives for so doing,\r\ncertain it is that he called it the _death_ or the _loss_ of\r\nthe Sieur Jumonville. So we received and so we understood it, until, to\r\nour great surprise and mortification, we found it otherwise in a\r\nliteral translation.\" Sparks, _Writings of Washington_, II. 464, 465.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix D\r\n\r\nChapter 7. Braddock\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Beaujeu, and not Contrecoeur, commanded\r\nat Fort Duquesne at the time of Braddock's expedition. Some\r\ncontemporaries, and notably the chaplain of the fort, do, in fact,\r\nspeak of him as in this position; but their evidence is overborne\r\nby more numerous and conclusive authorities, among them Vaudreuil,\r\ngovernor of Canada, and Contrecoeur himself, in an official\r\nreport. Vaudreuil says of him: \"Ce commandant s'occupa le 8\r\n[_Juillet_] à former un parti pour aller au devant des Anglois;\" and\r\nadds that this party was commanded by Beaujeu and consisted of\r\n250 French and 650 Indians (_Vaudreuil au Ministre, 5 Août,\r\n1755_). In the autumn of 1756 Vaudreuil asked the Colonial Minister\r\nto procure a pension for Contrecoeur and Ligneris. He says:\r\n\"Le premier de ces Messieurs a commandé longtemps au fort\r\nDuquesne; c'est luy qui a ordonné et dirigé tous les mouvements\r\nqui se sont faits dans cette partie, soit pour faire abandonner le\r\npremier établissement des Anglois, soit pour les forcer à se\r\nretirer du fort Nécessité, et soit enfin pour aller au devant de\r\nl'armée du Général Braddock qui a été entièrement défaite\" (_Vaudreuil\r\nau Ministre, 8 Nov. 1756_.) Beaujeu, who had lately arrived with a\r\nreinforcement, had been named to relieve Contrecoeur (_Dumas au Ministre,\r\n24 Juillet, 1756_), but had not yet done so.\r\n\r\nAs the report of Contrecoeur has never been printed, I give an\r\nextract from it (_Contrecceur à Vaudreuil, 14 Juillet, 1755_, in\r\nArchives de la Marine):--\r\n\r\n\"Le meme jour [_8 Juillet_] je formai un party de tout ce que\r\nje pouvois mettre hors du fort pour aller à leur rencontre. Il étoit\r\ncomposé de 250 François et de 650 sauvages, ce qui faisoit 900\r\nhommes. M. de Beaujeu, capitaine, le commandoit. Il y avoit deux\r\ncapitaines qui estoient Mrs. Dumas et Ligneris et plusieurs autres\r\nofficiers subalternes. Ce parti se mit en marche le 9 à 8 heures\r\ndu matin, et se trouva à midi et demie en présence des Anglois\r\nà environ 3 lieues du fort. On commença à faire feu de part et\r\nd'autre. Le feu de l'artillerie ennemie fit reculer un peu par deux\r\nfois notre parti. M. de Beaujeu fut tué à la troisième décharge.\r\nM. Dumas prit le commandement et s'en acquitta au mieux. Nos\r\nFrançois, pleins de courage, soutenus par les sauvages, quoiqu'ils\r\nn'eussent point d'artillerie, firent à leur tour plier les Anglois qui\r\nse battirent en ordre de bataille et en bonne contenance. Et ces\r\nderniers voyant l'ardeur de nos gens qui fonçoient avec une vigeur\r\ninfinie furent enfin obligés de plier tout à fait après 4 heures d'un\r\ngrand feu. Mrs. Dumas et Ligneris qui n'avoient plus avec eux\r\nq'une vingtaine de François ne s'engagerent point dans la poursuite.\r\nIls rentrerent dans le fort, parceq'une grande partie des\r\nCanadiens qui n'estoient malheureusement que des enfants s'estoient\r\nretirés à la première décharge.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter of Dumas cited in the text has been equally unknown.\r\nIt was written a year after the battle in order to draw the attention\r\nof the minister to services which the writer thought had not been\r\nduly recognized. The following is an extract (_Dumas au Ministre,\r\n24 Juillet, 1756_, in Archives de la Marine):--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"M. de Beaujeu marcha donc, et sous ses ordres M. de Ligneris\r\net moi. Il attaqua avec beaucoup d'audace mais sans nulle disposition;\r\nnotre première décharge fut faite hors de portée; l'ennemi\r\nfit la sienne de plus près, et dans le premier instant du combat,\r\ncent miliciens, qui faisaient la moitié de nos Français\r\nlâchèrent honteusement le pied en criant 'Sauve qui peut.' Deux\r\ncadets qui depuis ont été faits officiers autorisaient cette fuite par\r\nleur exemple. Ce mouvement en arrière ayant encouragé l'ennemi,\r\nil fit retentir ses cris de Vive le Roi et avança sur nous à grand\r\npas. Son artillerie s'étant preparée pendant ce temps là commença\r\nà faire feu ce qui épouvanta tellement les Sauvages que tout prit\r\nla fuite; l'ennemi faísait sa troisième décharge de mousqueterie\r\nquand M. de Beaujeu fut tué.\"\r\n\r\n\"Notre déroute se présenta a mes yeux sous le plus désagréable\r\npoint de vue, et pour n'être point chargé de la mauvaise manoeuvre\r\nd'autrui, je ne songeai plus qu'à me faire tuer. Ce fut alors,\r\nMonseigneur, qu'excitant de la voix et du geste le peu de soldats\r\nqui restait, je m'avançai avec la contenance qui donne le désespoir.\r\nMon peloton fit un feu si vif que l'ennemi en parut étonné; il\r\ngrossit insensiblement et les Sauvages voyant que mon attaque\r\nfaisait cesser les crís de l'ennemi revinrent à moi. Dans ce moment\r\nj'envoyai M. le Chev'r. Le Borgne et M. de Rocheblave dire\r\naux officiers qui étaient à la tête des Sauvages de prendre l'ennemi\r\nen flanc. Le canon qui battit en tête donna faveur à mes ordres.\r\nL'ennemi, pris de tous cotés, combattit avec la fermeté la plus\r\nopiniâtre. Des rangs entiers tombaient à la fois; presque tous\r\nles officiers périrent; et le désordre s'étant mis par là dans cette\r\ncolonne, tout prit la fuite.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the conduct of the Canadian militia,\r\nthe French officers behaved with the utmost courage, and shared\r\nwith the Indians the honors of the victory. The partisan chief\r\nCharles Langlade seems also to have been especially prominent.\r\nHis grandson, the aged Pierre Grignon, declared that it was he\r\nwho led the attack (Draper, _Recollections of Grignon_, in the\r\n_Collections of the Wisconsin Historical Society,_ III.). Such evidence,\r\ntaken alone, is of the least possible weight; but both the\r\ntraveller Anbury and General John Burgoyne, writing many years\r\nafter the event, speak of Langlade, who was then alive, as the\r\nauthor of Braddock's defeat. Hence there can be little doubt that\r\nhe took an important part in it, though the contemporary writers\r\ndo not mention his name. Compare Tassé, _Notice sur Charles\r\nLanglade_. The honors fell to Contrecoeur, Dumas, and Ligneris,\r\nall of whom received the cross of the Order of St Louis (_Ordres\r\ndu Roy et Dépêches des Ministres_, 1755).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix E\r\n\r\nChapter 14.

POWNALL.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix G\r\n\r\nChapter 20. Ticonderoga\r\n\r\n\r\nThe French accounts of the battle at Ticonderoga are very\r\nnumerous, and consist of letters and despatches of Montcalm,\r\nLévis, Bougainville, Doreil, and other officers, besides several\r\nanonymous narratives, one of which was printed in pamphlet\r\nform at the time. Translations of many of them may be found in\r\n_N.Y. Colonial Documents,_ X. There are, however, various others\r\npreserved in the archives of the War and Marine Departments at\r\nParis which have not seen the light. I have carefully examined\r\nand collated them all. The English accounts are by no means so\r\nnumerous or so minute. Among those not already cited, may be\r\nmentioned a letter of Colonel Woolsey of the New York provincials,\r\nand two letters from British officers written just after the\r\nbattle and enclosed in a letter from Alexander Colden to Major\r\nHalkett, 17 July. (_Bouquet and Haldimand Papers._)\r\n\r\nThe French greatly exaggerated the force of the English and\r\ntheir losses in the battle. They place the former at from twenty\r\nthousand to thirty-one thousand, and the latter at from four\r\nthousand to six thousand. Prisoners taken at the end of the battle\r\ntold them that the English had lost four thousand,--a statement\r\nwhich they readily accepted, though the prisoners could have\r\nknown little more about the matter than they themselves. And\r\nthese figures were easily magnified. The number of dead lying\r\nbefore the lines is variously given at from eight hundred to three\r\nthousand. Montcalm himself, who was somewhat elated by his\r\nvictory, gives this last number in one of his letters, though he\r\nelsewhere says two thousand; while Lévis, in his _Journal de la\r\nGuerre,_ says \"about eight hundred.\" The truth is that no pains\r\nwere taken to ascertain the exact number, which, by the English\r\nreturns, was a little above five hundred, the total of killed,\r\nwounded, and missing being nineteen hundred and forty-four. A\r\nfriend of Knox, writing to him from Fort Edward three weeks\r\nafter the battle, gives a tabular statement which shows nineteen\r\nhundred and fifty in all, or six more than the official report. As\r\nthe name of every officer killed or wounded, with the corps to\r\nwhich he belonged, was published at the time (_London Magazine_,\r\n1758), it is extremely unlikely that the official return was\r\nfalsified. Abercromby's letter to Pitt, of July 12, says that he\r\nretreated \"with the loss of four hundred and sixty-four regulars\r\nkilled, twenty-nine missing eleven hundred and seventeen wounded;\r\nand eighty-seven provincials killed, eight missing, and two hundred\r\nand thirty-nine wounded, officers of both included.\" In a\r\nletter to Viscount Barrington, of the same date (Public Record\r\nOffice), Abercromby encloses a full detail of losses, regiment by\r\nregiment and company by company, being a total of nineteen\r\nhundred and forty-five. Several of the French writers state correctly\r\nthat about fourteen thousand men (including reserves) were engaged in\r\nthe attacks; but they add erroneously that there were thirteen thousand\r\nmore at the Falls. In fact there was only a small provincial regiment\r\nleft there, and a battalion of the New York regiment, under Colonel\r\nWoolsey, at the landing.\r\n\r\nA LEGEND OF TICONDEROGA.--Mention has been made of the\r\ndeath of Major Duncan Campbell of Inverawe. The following\r\nfamily tradition relating to it was told me in 1878 by the late\r\nDean Stanley, to whom I am also indebted for various papers on\r\nthe subject, including a letter from James Campbell, Esq., the\r\npresent laird of Inverawe, and great-nephew of the hero of the\r\ntale. The same story is told, in an amplified form and with some\r\nvariations, in the _Legendary Tales of the Highlands_ of Sir Thomas\r\nDick Lauder. As related by Dean Stanley and approved by Mr.\r\nCampbell, it is this:--\r\n\r\nThe ancient castle of Inverawe stands by the banks of the Awe,\r\nin the midst of the wild and picturesque scenery of the western\r\nHighlands. Late one evening, before the middle of the last century,\r\nas the laird, Duncan Campbell, sat alone in the old hall,\r\nthere was a loud knocking at the gate; and, opening it, he saw\r\na stranger, with torn clothing and kilt besmeared with blood, who\r\nin a breathless voice begged for asylum. He went on to say that\r\nhe had killed a man in a fray, and that the pursuers were at his\r\nheels. Campbell promised to shelter him. \"Swear on your dirk!\"\r\nsaid the stranger; and Campbell swore. He then led him to a secret\r\nrecess in the depths of the castle. Scarcely was he hidden when\r\nagain there was a loud knocking at the gate, and two armed men\r\nappeared. \"Your cousin Donald has been murdered, and we are\r\nlooking for the murderer!\" Campbell, remembering his oath,\r\nprofessed to have no knowledge of the fugitive; and the men went\r\non their way. The laird, in great agitation, lay down to rest in\r\na large dark room, where at length he feel asleep. Waking suddenly\r\nin bewilderment and terror, he saw the ghost of the murdered\r\nDonald standing by his bedside, and heard a hollow voice\r\npronounce the words: _\"Inverawe! Inverawe! blood has been shed.\r\nShield not the murderer!\"_ In the morning Campbell went to the\r\nhiding-place of the guilty man and told him that he could harbor\r\nhim no longer. \"You have sworn on your dirk!\" he replied; and\r\nthe laird of Inverawe, greatly perplexed and troubled, made a\r\ncompromise between conflicting duties, promised not to betray\r\nhis guest, led him to the neighboring mountain, and hid him in\r\na cave.\r\n\r\nIn the next night, as he lay tossing in feverish slumbers, the\r\nsame stern voice awoke him, the ghost of his cousin Donald stood\r\nagain at his bedside, and again he heard the same appalling words:\r\n_\"Inverawe! Inverawe! blood has been shed. Shield not the murderer!\"_\r\nAt break of day he hastened, in strange agitation, to the\r\ncave; but it was empty, the stranger was gone. At night, as he\r\nstrove in vain to sleep, the vision appeared once more, ghastly\r\npale, but less stern of aspect than before. _\"Farewell, Inverawe!\"_\r\nit said; _\"Farewell, till we meet at TICONDEROGA!\"_\r\n\r\nThe strange name dwelt in Campbell's memory. He had joined\r\nthe Black Watch, or Forty-second Regiment, then employed\r\nin keeping order in the turbulent Highlands. In time he became\r\nits major; and, a year or two after the war broke out, he went\r\nwith it to America. Here, to his horror, he learned that it was\r\nordered to the attack of Ticonderoga. His story was well known\r\namong his brother officers. They combined among themselves to\r\ndisarm his fears; and when they reached the fatal spot they told\r\nhim on the eve of the battle, \"This is not Ticonderoga; we are not\r\nthere yet; this is Fort George.\" But in the morning he came to\r\nthem with haggard looks. \"I have seen him! You have deceived\r\nme! He came to my tent last night! This is Ticonderoga! I shall\r\ndie to-day!\" and his prediction was fulfilled.\r\n\r\nSuch is the tradition. The indisputable facts are that Major\r\nDuncan Campbell of Inverawe, his arm shattered by a bullet,\r\nwas carried to Fort Edward, where, after amputation, he died and\r\nwas buried. (_Abercromby to Pitt_,19 _August_, 1758.) The stone\r\nthat marks his grave may still be seen, with this inscription: _\"Here\r\nlyes the Body of Duncan Campbell of Inverawe, Esq, Major to\r\nthe old Highland Regiment, aged 55 Years, who died on the 17th\r\nJuly, 1758, of the Wounds he received in the Attack of the Retrenchment\r\nof Ticonderoga or Carrillon, on the 8th July, 1758.\"_\r\n\r\nHis son, Lieutenant Alexander Campbell, was severely wounded\r\nat the same time, but reached Scotland alive, and died in Glasgow.\r\nMr. Campbell, the present Inverawe, in the letter mentioned\r\nabove, says that forty-five years ago he knew an old man whose\r\ngrandfather was foster-brother to the slain major of the forty-second,\r\nand who told him the following story while carrying a salmon for him\r\nto an inn near Inverawe. The old man's grandfather was sleeping with his\r\nson, then a lad, in the same room, but in another bed. This son,\r\nfather of the narrator, \"was awakened,\" to borrow the words of\r\nMr. Campbell, \"by some unaccustomed sound, and behold there was a\r\nbright light in the room, and he saw a figure, in full Highland\r\nregimentals, cross over the room and stoop down over his father's\r\nbed and give him a kiss. He was too frightened to speak, but put his\r\nhead under his coverlet and went to sleep. Once more he was roused in\r\nlike manner, and saw the same sight. In the morning he spoke to his\r\nfather about it, who told him that it was Macdonnochie _[the Gaelic\r\npatronymic of the laird of Inverawe]_ whom he had seen, and who came to\r\ntell him that he had been killed in a great battle in America.\r\nSure enough, said my informant, it was on the very day that the\r\nbattle of Ticonderoga was fought and the laird was killed.\"\r\n\r\nIt is also said that two ladies of the family of Inverawe saw a\r\nbattle in the clouds, in which the shadowy forms of Highland\r\nwarriors were plainly to be described; and that when the fatal\r\nnews came from America, it was found that the time of the\r\nvision answered exactly to that of the battle in which the head\r\nof the family fell.\r\n\r\nThe legend of Inverawe has within a few years found its way\r\ninto an English magazine, and it has also been excellently told\r\nin the _Atlantic Monthly_ of September of this year, 1884, by Miss\r\nC.F. Gordon Cumming. Her version differs a little from that\r\ngiven above from the recital of Dean Stanley and the present laird\r\nof Inverawe, but the essential points are the same. Miss Gordon\r\nCumming, however, is in error when she says that Duncan Campbell\r\nwas wounded in the breast, and that he was first buried at\r\nTiconderoga. His burial-place was near Fort Edward, where he\r\ndied, and where his remains still lie, though not at the same spot,\r\nas they were long after removed by a family named Gilchrist,\r\nwho claimed kinship with the Campbells of Inverawe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix H\r\n\r\nChapter 25.

M. de Boishébert\r\narriva ensuite avec les Acadiens et sauvages qu'il avoit rassemblés.\r\nJe réglai la garnison de Québec à 2,000 hommes.\" _Vaudreuil\r\nau Ministre, 5 Oct. 1759._\r\n\r\nThe commissary Berniers says that the whole force was about\r\nfifteen thousand men, besides Indians, which is less than the number\r\ngiven by Vaudreuil.\r\n\r\nBigot says: \"Nous avions 13,000 hommes et mille à 1,200 sauvages,\r\nsans compter 2,000 hommes de garnison dans la ville.\" _Bigot au Ministre,\r\n25 Oct. 1759._\r\n\r\nThe Hartwell _Journal du Siége_ says: \"II fut décidé qu'on ne\r\nlaisseroit dans la place que 1,200 hommes, et que tout le reste\r\nmarcheroit au camp, où l'on comptoit se trouver plus de 15,000\r\nhommes, y compris les sauvages.\"\r\n\r\nRigaud, Vaudreuil's brother, writing from Montreal to Bourlamaque\r\non the 23d of June, says: \"Je compte que l'armée campée\r\nsous Québec sera de 17,000 hommes bien effectifs, sans les sauvages.\"\r\nHe then gives a list of Indians who have joined the army,\r\nor are on the way, amounting to thirteen hundred.\r\n\r\nAt the end of June Wolfe had about eight thousand six hundred\r\neffective soldiers. Of these the ten battalions, commonly mentioned\r\nas regiments, supplied six thousand four hundred; detached\r\ngrenadiers from Louisbourg, three hundred; artillery, three hundred;\r\nrangers, four hundred; light infantry, two hundred; marines,\r\none thousand. The complement of the battalions was in some cases\r\nseven hundred and in others one thousand (Knox, II. 25); but\r\ntheir actual strength varied from five hundred to eight hundred,\r\nexcept the Highlanders, who mustered eleven hundred, their ranks\r\nbeing more than full. Fraser, in his _Journal of the Siege_, gives a\r\ntabular view of the whole. At the end of the campaign Lévis\r\nreckons the remaining English troops at about six thousand (_Lévis\r\nau Ministre, 10 Nov. 1759_), which answers to the report of General\r\nMurray: \"The troops will amount to six thousand\" (_Murray\r\nto Pitt, 12 Oct. 1759_). The precise number is given in the _Return\r\nof the State of His Majesty's Forces left in Garrison at Québec_,\r\ndated 12 Oct. 1759, and signed, Robert Monckton (Public Record\r\nOffice, _America and West Indies_, XCIX.). This shows the total\r\nof rank and file to have been 6,214, which the addition of officers,\r\nsergeants, and drummers raises to about seven thousand, besides\r\n171 artillerymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix I\r\n\r\nChapter 27. The Heights of Abraham\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most important unpublished documents on Wolfe's\r\noperations against Quebec is the long and elaborate _Journal\r\nmémoratif de ce qui s'est passé de plus remarquable pendant qu'a\r\nduré le Siége de la Ville de Québec_ (Archives de la Marine). The\r\nwriter, M. de Foligny, was a naval officer who during the siege\r\ncommanded one of the principal batteries of the town. The official\r\ncorrespondence of Vaudreuil for 1759 (Archives Nationales)\r\ngives the events of the time from his point of view; and various\r\nmanuscript letters of Bigot, Lévis, Montreuil, and others (Archives\r\nde la Marine, Archives de la Guerre) give additional particulars.\r\nThe letters, generally private and confidential, written to Bourlamaque\r\nby Montcalm, Lévis, Vaudreuil, Malartic, Berniers, and others during\r\nthe siege contain much that is curious and interesting.\r\n\r\n_Siége de Québec en 1759, d'après un Manuscrit déposé à la\r\nBibliothêque de Hartwell en Angleterre._ A very valuable diary,\r\nby a citizen of Quebec; it was brought from England in 1834 by\r\nthe Hon. D.B. Viger, and a few copies were printed at Quebec in\r\n1836. _Journal tenu a l'Armee que commandoit feu M. le Marquis\r\nde Montcalm._ A minute diary of an officer under Montcalm\r\n(printed by the Quebec Historical Society). _Memoire sur la Campagne\r\nde 1759, par M. de Joannès, Major de Québec_ (Archives de la Guerre).\r\n_Lettres et Depeches de Montcalm_ (Ibid.). These touch briefly\r\nthe antecedents of the Siege. _Mémoires sur le Canada depuis 1749\r\njusqu'à_ 1760 (Quebec Historical Society). _Journal du Siege de\r\nQuébec en 1759, par M. Jean Claude Panet, notaire_ (Ibid.). The\r\nwriter of this diary was in Quebec at the time. Several other journals\r\nand letters of persons present at the siege have been printed by the\r\nQuebec Historical Society, under the title _Événements de la Guerre\r\nen Canada durant les Années 1759 et 1760. Relation de ce qui s'est\r\npassé au Siége de Québec, par une Réligieuse de l'Hôpital Général\r\nde Québec_ (Quebec Historical Society). _Jugement impartial\r\nsur les Opérations militaires de la Campagne, par M'gr. de Pontbriand,\r\nÉvêque de Québec_ (Ibid.). _Memoirs of the Siege of Quebec, from\r\nthe Journal of a French Officer on board the Chezine Frigate, taken\r\nby His Majesty's Ship Rippon, by Richard Gardiner, Esq., Captain of\r\nMarines in the Rippon,_ London, 1761.\r\n\r\n_General Wolfe's Instructions to Young Officers,_ Philadelphia,\r\n1778. This title is misleading, the book being a collection of military\r\norders. _General Orders in Wolfe's Army_ (Quebec Historical\r\nSociety). This collection is much more full than the foregoing,\r\nso far as concerns the campaign of 1759. _Letters of Wolfe_ (in\r\nWright's _Wolfe_), _Despatches of Wolfe, Saunders, Monckton, and\r\nTownshend_ (in contemporary magazines). _A Short Authentic\r\nAccount of the Expedition against Quebec, by a Volunteer upon\r\nthat Expedition,_ Quebec, 1872. This valuable diary is ascribed to\r\nJames Thompson, a volunteer under Wolfe, who died at Quebec\r\nin 1830 at the age of ninety-eight, after holding for many years\r\nthe position of overseer of works in the Engineer Department.\r\nAnother manuscript, for the most part identical with this, was\r\nfound a few years ago among old papers in the office of the\r\nRoyal Engineers at Quebec. _Journal of the Expedition on the\r\nRiver St. Lawrence_. Two entirely distinct diaries bear this name.\r\nOne is printed in the _New York Mercury_ for December, 1759;\r\nthe other was found among the papers of George Alsopp, secretary\r\nto Sir Guy Carleton, who served under Wolfe (Quebec Historical\r\nSociety). Johnstone, _A Dialogue in Hades_ (Ibid.). The Scotch\r\nJacobite, Chevalier Johnstone, as aide-de-camp to Lévis, and afterwards\r\nto Montcalm, had great opportunities of acquiring information during\r\nthe campaign; and the results, though produced in the fanciful form\r\nof a dialogue between the ghosts of Wolfe and Montcalm, are of\r\nsubstantial historical value. The _Dialogue_ is followed by a\r\nplain personal narrative. Fraser, _Journal of the Siege of Quebec_\r\n(Ibid.). Fraser was an officer in the Seventy-eighth Highlanders.\r\n_Journal of the Siege of Quebec, by a Gentleman in an Eminent Station\r\non the Spot, Dublin, 1759_. _Journal of the Particular Transactions\r\nduring the Siege of Quebec_ (_Notes and Queries_, XX.). The writer\r\nwas a soldier or noncommissioned officer serving in the light infantry.\r\n\r\n_Memoirs of the Siege of Quebec and Total Reduction of Canada,\r\nby John Johnson, Clerk and Quarter-master Sergeant to the\r\nFifty-eighth Regiment_. A manuscript of 176 pages, written when\r\nJohnson was a pensioner at Chelsea (England). The handwriting\r\nis exceedingly neat and clear; and the style, though often grandiloquent,\r\nis creditable to a writer in his station. This curious production\r\nwas found among the papers of Thomas McDonough, Esq., formerly British\r\nConsul at Boston, and is in possession of his grandson, my relative,\r\nGeorge Francis Parkman, Esq., who, by inquiries at the Chelsea Hospital,\r\nlearned that Johnson was still living in 1802.\r\n\r\nI have read and collated with extreme care all the above authorities,\r\nwith others which need not be mentioned.\r\n\r\nAmong several manuscript maps and plans showing the operations\r\nof the siege may be mentioned one entitled, _Plan of the\r\nTown and Basin of Quebec and Part of the Adjacent Country,\r\nshewing the principal Encampments and Works of the British\r\nArmy commanded by Major Gen'l. Wolfe, and those of the French\r\nArmy by Lieut. Gen'l. the Marquis of Montcalm_. It is the work\r\nof three engineers of Wolfe's army, and is on a scale of eight\r\nhundred feet to an inch. A facsimile from the original in possession\r\nof the Royal Engineers is before me.\r\n\r\nAmong the \"King's Maps,\" British Museum (CXIX. 27), is a\r\nvery large colored plan of operations at Quebec in 1759, 1760,\r\nsuperbly executed in minute detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix J\r\n\r\nChapter 28. Fall of Quebec\r\n\r\n\r\n_Death and Burial of Montcalm_.--Johnstone, who had every\r\nmeans of knowing the facts, says that Montcalm was carried after\r\nhis wound to the house of the surgeon Arnoux. Yet it is not quite\r\ncertain that he died there. According to Knox, his death took\r\nplace at the General Hospital; according to the modern author\r\nof the _Ursulines de Québec_, at the Château St.-Louis. But the\r\nGeneral Hospital was a mile out of the town, and in momentary\r\ndanger of capture by the English; while the Château had been\r\nmade untenable by the batteries of Point Levi, being immediately\r\nexposed to their fire. Neither of these places was one to which the\r\ndying general was likely to be removed, and it is probable that he\r\nwas suffered to die in peace at the house of the surgeon.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the story of the burial of Montcalm in a\r\ngrave partially formed by the explosion of a bomb, rests only\r\non the assertion in his epitaph, composed in 1761 by the Academy\r\nof Inscriptions at the instance of Bougainville. There is, however,\r\nother evidence of the fact. The naval captain Foligny, writing\r\non the spot at the time of the burial, says in his Diary, under the\r\ndate of September 14: \"A huit heures du soir, dans l'église des\r\nUrsulines, fut enterré dans une fosse faite sous la chaire _par le\r\ntravail de la Bombe_, M. le Marquis de Montcalm, décédé du matin\r\nà 4 heures après avoir reçu tous les Sacrements. Jamais Général\r\nn'avoit été plus aimé de sa troupe et plus universellement regretté.\r\nIl étoit d'un esprit supérieur, doux, gracieux, affable,\r\nfamilier à tout le monde, ce qui lui avoit fait gagner la confiance\r\nde toute la Colonie: _requiescat in pace_.\"\r\n\r\nThe author of _Les Ursulines de Québec_ says: \"Un des projectiles\r\nayant fait une large ouverture dans le plancher de bas,\r\non en profita pour creuser la fosse du général.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Boston Post Boy and Advertiser_, in its issue of Dec. 3,\r\n1759, contains a letter from \"an officer of distinction\" at Quebec\r\nto Messrs. Green and Russell, proprietors of the newspaper. This\r\nletter contains the following words: \"He [_Montcalm_] died the\r\nnext day; and, with a little Improvement, one of our 13-inch Shell-Holes\r\nserved him for a Grave.\"\r\n\r\nThe particulars of his burial are from the _Acte Mortuaire du\r\nMarquis de Montcalm_ in the registers of the Church of Notre\r\nDame de Québec, and from that valuable chronicle, _Les Ursulines\r\nde Québec_, composed by the Superior of the convent. A nun of\r\nthe sisterhood, Mère Aimable Dubé de Saint-Ignace, was, when a\r\nchild, a witness of the scene, and preserved a vivid memory of\r\nit to the age of eighty-one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix K\r\n\r\nChapter 29. Sainte-Foy>\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH OF THE FRENCH AND ENGLISH AT THE BATTLE OF\r\nSTE-FOY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Public Record Office (_America and West Indies_, XCIX)\r\nare preserved the tabular returns of the garrison of Quebec for\r\n1759, 1760, sent by Murray to the War Office. They show the\r\nexact condition of each regiment, in all ranks, for every month\r\nof the autumn, winter, and spring. The return made out on the\r\n24th of April, four days before the battle, shows that the total\r\nnumber of rank and file, exclusive of non commissioned officers\r\nand drummers, was 6,808, of whom 2,612 were fit for duty in\r\nQuebec, and 654 at other places in Canada, that is, at Ste Foy,\r\nOld Lorette, and the other outposts. This gives a total of 3,266\r\nrank and file fit for duty at or near Quebec, besides which there\r\nwere between one hundred and two hundred artillerymen, and\r\na company of rangers. This was Murray's whole available force\r\nat the time. Of the rest of the 6,808 who appear in the return,\r\n2,299 were invalids at Quebec, and 669 in New York, 538 were\r\non service in Halifax and New York, and 36 were absent on furlough.\r\nThese figures nearly answer to the condensed statement of\r\nFraser, and confirm the various English statements of the numbers\r\nthat took part in the battle; namely, 3,140 (Knox), 3,000\r\n(John Johnson), 3,111, and elsewhere, in round numbers, 3,000\r\n(Murray) Lévis, with natural exaggeration, says 4,000. Three or\r\nfour hundred were left in Quebec to guard the walls when the\r\nrest marched out.\r\n\r\nI have been thus particular because a Canadian writer, Garneau,\r\nsays \"Murray sortit de la ville le 28 au matin à la tête de toute\r\nla garnison, dont les seules troupes de la ligne comptaient encore\r\n7,714 combattants, non compris les officiers.\" To prove this, he\r\ncites the pay-roll of the garrison, which, in fact, corresponds to\r\nthe returns of the same date, if noncommissioned officers, drummers,\r\nand artillerymen are counted with the rank and file. But\r\nGarneau falls into a double error. He assumes, first, that there\r\nwere no men on the sick list, and secondly, that there were none\r\nabsent from Quebec, when in reality, as the returns show, considerably\r\nmore than half were in one or the other of these categories.\r\nThe pay-rolls were made out at the headquarters of each\r\ncorps, and always included the entire number of men enlisted in\r\nit, whether sick or well, present or absent. On the same fallacious\r\npremises Garneau affirms that Wolfe, at the battle on the Plains\r\nof Abraham, had eight thousand soldiers, or a little less than\r\ndouble his actual force.\r\n\r\nHaving stated, as above, that Murray marched out of Quebec\r\nwith at least 1,714 effective troops, Garneau, not very consistently,\r\ngoes on to say that he advanced against Levis with six thousand\r\nor seven thousand men, and he adds that the two armies were\r\nabout equal, because Levis had left some detachments behind to\r\nguard his boats and artillery. The number of the French, after\r\nthey had all reached the field, was, in truth, about seven thousand;\r\nat the beginning of the fight it seems not to have exceeded five\r\nthousand. The _Relation de la seconde Bataille de Quebec_ says:\r\n\"Notre petite armée consistoit _au moment de l'action_ en 3,000\r\nhommes de troupes reglées et 2,000 Canadiens ou sauvages.\" A\r\nlarge number of Canadians came up from Sillery while the affair\r\nwent on, and as the whole French army, except the detachments\r\nmentioned by Garneau, had passed the night at no greater distance\r\nfrom the field than Ste-Foy and Sillery, the last man must\r\nhave reached it before the firing was half over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex\r\n\r\n   A\r\n   Abenaki Indians, 50, 122, 157, 262, 335\r\n
