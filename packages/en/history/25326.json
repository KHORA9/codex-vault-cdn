The style of\r\nthat text is sometimes laboured and pompous; it is often ungrammatical.\r\nBut the narrative is generally lively, full of neat phrases, and\r\nabounding in quaint expressions--many of them still recognizable in the\r\nmodern Florentine vernacular--while, in such Lives as those of Giotto,\r\nLeonardo da Vinci, and Michelagnolo, Vasari shows how well he can rise\r\nto a fine subject. His criticism is generally sound, solid, and direct;\r\nand he employs few technical terms, except in connection with\r\narchitecture, where we find passages full of technicalities, often so\r\nloosely used that it is difficult to be sure of their exact meaning. In\r\nsuch cases I have invariably adopted the rendering which seemed most in\r\naccordance with Vasari's actual words, so far as these could be\r\nexplained by professional advice and local knowledge; and I have\r\nincluded brief notes where they appeared to be indispensable.\r\n\r\nIn Mrs. Foster's familiar English paraphrase--for a paraphrase it is\r\nrather than a translation--all Vasari's liveliness evaporates, even\r\nwhere his meaning is not blurred or misunderstood. Perhaps I have gone\r\ntoo far towards the other extreme in relying upon the Anglo-Saxon side\r\nof the English language rather than upon the Latin, and in taking no\r\nliberties whatever with the text of 1568. My intention, indeed, has been\r\nto render my original word for word, and to err, if at all, in favour of\r\nliteralness. The very structure of Vasari's sentences has usually been\r\nretained, though some freedom was necessary in the matter of the\r\npunctuation, which is generally bewildering. As Mr. Horne's only too\r\nrare translation of the Life of Leonardo da Vinci has proved, it is by\r\nsome such method that we can best keep Vasari's sense and Vasari's\r\nspirit--the one as important to the student of Italian art as is the\r\nother to the general reader. Such an attempt, however, places an English\r\ntranslator of the first volume at a conspicuous disadvantage. Throughout\r\nthe earlier Lives Vasari seems to be feeling his way. He is not sure of\r\nhimself, and his style is often awkward. The more faithful the attempted\r\nrendering, the more plainly must that awkwardness be reproduced.\r\n\r\nVasari's Introduction on Technique has not been included, because it has\r\nno immediate connection with the Lives. In any case, there already\r\nexists an adequate translation by Miss Maclehose. All Vasari's other\r\nprefaces and introductions are given in the order in which they are\r\nfound in the edition of 1568.\r\n\r\nWith this much explanation, I may pass to personal matters, and record\r\nmy thanks to many Florentine friends for help in technical and\r\ngrammatical questions; to Professor Baldwin Brown for the notes on\r\ntechnical matters printed with Miss Maclehose's translation of \"Vasari\r\non Technique\"; and to Mr. C. J. Holmes, of the National Portrait\r\nGallery, for encouragement in a task which has proved no less pleasant\r\nthan difficult.\r\n\r\n     G. DU C. DE V.\r\n\r\n     LONDON,\r\n     _March 1912_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AND MOST EXCELLENT SIGNOR COSIMO DE' MEDICI,\r\nDUKE OF FLORENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nMY MOST HONOURED LORD,\r\n\r\nSeeing that your Excellency, following in this the footsteps of your\r\nmost Illustrious ancestors, and incited and urged by your own natural\r\nmagnanimity, ceases not to favour and to exalt every kind of talent,\r\nwheresoever it may be found, and shows particular favour to the arts of\r\ndesign, fondness for their craftsmen,[1] and understanding and delight\r\nin their beautiful and rare works; I think that you cannot but take\r\npleasure in this labour which I have undertaken, of writing down the\r\nlives, the works, the manners, and the circumstances of all those who,\r\nfinding the arts already dead, first revived them, then step by step\r\nnourished and adorned them, and finally brought them to that height of\r\nbeauty and majesty whereon they stand at the present day. And because\r\nthese masters have been almost all Tuscans, and most of these\r\nFlorentines, of whom many have been incited and aided by your most\r\nIllustrious ancestors with every kind of reward and honour to put\r\nthemselves to work, it may be said that in your state, nay, in your most\r\nblessed house the arts were born anew, and that through the generosity\r\nof your ancestors the world has recovered these most beautiful arts,\r\nthrough which it has been ennobled and embellished.\r\n\r\nWherefore, through the debt which this age, these arts, and these\r\ncraftsmen owe to your ancestors, and to you as the heir of their virtue\r\nand of their patronage of these professions, and through that debt which\r\nI, above all, owe them, seeing that I was taught by them, that I was\r\ntheir subject and their devoted servant, that I was brought up under\r\nCardinal Ippolito de' Medici, and under Alessandro, your predecessor,\r\nand that, finally, I am infinitely attached to the blessed memory of the\r\nMagnificent Ottaviano de' Medici, by whom I was supported, loved and\r\nprotected while he lived; for all these reasons, I say, and because from\r\nthe greatness of your worth and of your fortunes there will come much\r\nfavour for this work, and from your understanding of its subject there\r\nwill come a better appreciation than from any other for its usefulness\r\nand for the labour and the diligence that I have given to its execution,\r\nit has seemed to me that to your Excellency alone could it be fittingly\r\ndedicated, and it is under your most honoured name that I have wished it\r\nto come to the hands of men.\r\n\r\nDeign, then, Excellency, to accept it, to favour it, and, if this may be\r\ngranted to it by your exalted thoughts, sometimes to read it; having\r\nregard to the nature of the matter therein dealt with and to my pure\r\nintention, which has been, not to gain for myself praise as a writer,\r\nbut as craftsman to praise the industry and to revive the memory of\r\nthose who, having given life and adornment to these professions, do not\r\ndeserve to have their names and their works wholly left, even as they\r\nwere, the prey of death and of oblivion. Besides, at the same time,\r\nthrough the example of so many able men and through so many observations\r\non so many works that I have gathered together in this book, I have\r\nthought to help not a little the masters of these exercises and to\r\nplease all those who therein have taste and pleasure. This I have\r\nstriven to do with that accuracy and with that good faith which are\r\nessential for the truth of history and of things written. But if my\r\nwriting, being unpolished and as artless as my speech, be unworthy of\r\nyour Excellency's ear and of the merits of so many most illustrious\r\nintellects; as for them, pardon me that the pen of a draughtsman, such\r\nas they too were, has no greater power to give them outline and shadow;\r\nand as for yourself, let it suffice me that your Excellency should deign\r\nto approve my simple labour, remembering that the necessity of gaining\r\nfor myself the wherewithal to live has left me no time to exercise\r\nmyself with any instrument but the brush. Nor even with that have I\r\nreached that goal to which I think to be able to attain, now that\r\nFortune promises me so much favour, that, with greater ease and greater\r\ncredit for myself and with greater satisfaction to others, I may\r\nperchance be able, as well with the pen as with the brush, to unfold my\r\nideas to the world, whatsoever they may be. For besides the help and\r\nprotection for which I must hope from your Excellency, as my liege lord\r\nand as the protector of poor followers of the arts, it has pleased the\r\ngoodness of God to elect as His Vicar on earth the most holy and most\r\nblessed Julius III, Supreme Pontiff and a friend and patron of every\r\nkind of excellence and of these most excellent and most difficult arts\r\nin particular, from whose exalted liberality I expect recompense for\r\nmany years spent and many labours expended, and up to now without fruit.\r\nAnd not only I, who have dedicated myself to the perpetual service of\r\nHis Holiness, but all the gifted craftsmen of this age, must expect from\r\nhim such honour and reward and opportunities for practising the arts so\r\ngreatly, that already I rejoice to see these arts arriving in his time\r\nat the greatest height of their perfection, and Rome adorned by\r\ncraftsmen so many and so noble that, counting them with those of\r\nFlorence, whom your Excellency is calling every day into activity, I\r\nhope that someone after our time will have to write a fourth part to my\r\nbook, enriching it with other masters and other masterpieces than those\r\ndescribed by me; in which company I am striving with every effort not to\r\nbe among the last.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I am content if your Excellency has good hope of me and a\r\nbetter opinion than that which, by no fault of mine, you have perchance\r\nconceived of me; beseeching you not to let me be undone in your\r\nestimation by the malignant tales of other men, until at last my life\r\nand my works shall prove the contrary to what they say.\r\n\r\nNow with that intent to which I hold, always to honour and to serve\r\nyour Excellency, dedicating to you this my rough labour, as I have\r\ndedicated to you every other thing of mine and my own self, I implore\r\nyou not to disdain to grant it your protection, or at least to\r\nappreciate the devotion of him who offers it to you; and recommending\r\nmyself to your gracious goodness, most humbly do I kiss your hand.\r\n\r\n     Your Excellency's most humble Servant,\r\n     GIORGIO VASARI,\r\n     _Painter of Arezzo_.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The word \"artist\" has become impossible as a translation of\r\n\"artefice.\" Such words as \"artificer,\" \"art-worker,\" or \"artisan,\" seem\r\neven worse. \"Craftsman\" loses the alliterative connection with \"art,\"\r\nbut it comes nearest to expressing Vasari's idea of the \"artefice\" as a\r\npractical workman (_cf._ his remark about Ambrogio Lorenzetti: \"The ways\r\nof Ambrogio were rather those of a 'gentiluomo' than of an\r\n'artefice'\").]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AND MOST EXCELLENT SIGNOR COSIMO DE' MEDICI,\r\nDUKE OF FLORENCE AND SIENA\r\n\r\n\r\nMY MOST HONOURED LORD,\r\n\r\nBehold, seventeen years since I first presented to your most Illustrious\r\nExcellency the Lives, sketched so to speak, of the most famous painters,\r\nsculptors and architects, they come before you again, not indeed wholly\r\nfinished, but so much changed from what they were and in such wise\r\nadorned and enriched with innumerable works, whereof up to that time I\r\nhad been able to gain no further knowledge, that from my endeavour and\r\nin so far as in me lies nothing more can be looked for in them.\r\n\r\nBehold, I say, once again they come before you, most Illustrious and\r\ntruly most Excellent Lord Duke, with the addition of other noble and\r\nright famous craftsmen, who from that time up to our own day have passed\r\nfrom the miseries of this life to a better, and of others who, although\r\nthey are still living in our midst, have laboured in these professions\r\nto such purpose that they are most worthy of eternal memory. And in\r\ntruth it has been no small good-fortune for many that I, by the goodness\r\nof Him in whom all things have their being, have lived so long that I\r\nhave almost rewritten this book; seeing that, even as I have removed\r\nmany things which had been included I know not how, in my absence and\r\nwithout my consent, and have changed others, so too I have added many,\r\nboth useful and necessary, that were lacking. And as for the likenesses\r\nand portraits of so many men of worth which I have placed in this work,\r\nwhereof a great part have been furnished by the help and co-operation of\r\nyour Excellency, if they are sometimes not very true to life, and if\r\nthey all have not that character and resemblance which the vivacity of\r\ncolours is wont to give them, that is not because the drawing and the\r\nlineaments have not been taken from the life and are not characteristic\r\nand natural; not to mention that a great part of them have been sent me\r\nby the friends that I have in various places, and they have not all been\r\ndrawn by a good hand. Moreover, I have suffered no small inconvenience\r\nin this from the distance of those who have engraved these heads,\r\nbecause, if the engravers had been near me, it might perchance have been\r\npossible to use in this matter more diligence than has been shown. But\r\nhowever this may be, our lovers of art and our craftsmen, for the\r\nconvenience and benefit of whom I have put myself to so great pains,\r\nmust be wholly indebted to your most Illustrious Excellency for whatever\r\nthey may find in it of the good, the useful, and the helpful, seeing\r\nthat while engaged in your service I have had the opportunity, through\r\nthe leisure which it has pleased you to give me and through the\r\nmanagement of your many, nay, innumerable treasures, to put together and\r\nto give to the world everything which appeared to be necessary for the\r\nperfect completion of this work; and would it not be almost impiety, not\r\nto say ingratitude, were I to dedicate these Lives to another, or were\r\nthe craftsmen to attribute to any other than yourself whatever they may\r\nfind in them to give them help or pleasure? For not only was it with\r\nyour help and favour that they first came to the light, as now they do\r\nagain, but you are, in imitation of your ancestors, sole father, sole\r\nlord, and sole protector of these our arts. Wherefore it is very right\r\nand reasonable that by these there should be made, in your service and\r\nto your eternal and perpetual memory, so many most noble pictures and\r\nstatues and so many marvellous buildings in every manner.\r\n\r\nBut if we are all, as indeed we are beyond calculation, most deeply\r\nobliged to you for these and for other reasons, how much more do I not\r\nowe to you, who have always had (would that my brain and my hand had\r\nbeen equal to my desire and right good will) so many valuable\r\nopportunities to display my little knowledge, which, whatsoever it may\r\nbe, fails by a very great measure to counterbalance the greatness and\r\nthe truly royal magnificence of your mind? But how may I tell? It is in\r\ntruth better that I should stay as I am than that I should set myself to\r\nattempt what would be to the most lofty and noble brain, and much more\r\nso to my insignificance, wholly impossible.\r\n\r\nAccept then, most Illustrious Excellency, this my book, or rather indeed\r\nyour book, of the Lives of the craftsmen of design; and like the\r\nAlmighty God, looking rather at my soul and at my good intentions than\r\nat my work, take from me with right good will not what I would wish and\r\nought to give, but what I can.\r\n\r\n     Your most Illustrious Excellency's most indebted servant,\r\n     GIORGIO VASARI.\r\n\r\n     FLORENCE,\r\n     _January 9, 1568_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIUS PAPA QUINTUS\r\n\r\n\r\nMotu proprio (et cet.).

Maij,\r\n     anno secundo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE WHOLE WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the wont of the finest spirits in all their actions, through a\r\nburning desire for glory, to spare no labour, however grievous, in order\r\nto bring their works to that perfection which might render them\r\nimpressive and marvellous to the whole world; nor could the humble\r\nfortunes of many prevent their energies from attaining to the highest\r\nrank, whether in order to live in honour or to leave in the ages to come\r\neternal fame for all their rare excellence. And although, for zeal and\r\ndesire so worthy of praise, they were, while living, highly rewarded by\r\nthe liberality of Princes and by the splendid ambition of States, and\r\neven after death kept alive in the eyes of the world by the testimony of\r\nstatues, tombs, medals, and other memorials of that kind; none the less,\r\nit is clearly seen that the ravening maw of time has not only diminished\r\nby a great amount their own works and the honourable testimonies of\r\nothers, but has also blotted out and destroyed the names of all those\r\nwho have been kept alive by any other means than by the right vivacious\r\nand pious pens of writers.\r\n\r\nPondering over this matter many a time in my own mind, and recognizing,\r\nfrom the example not only of the ancients but of the moderns as well,\r\nthat the names of very many architects, sculptors, and painters, both\r\nold and modern, together with innumerable most beautiful works wrought\r\nby them, are going on being forgotten and destroyed little by little,\r\nand in such wise, in truth, that nothing can be foretold for them but a\r\ncertain and wellnigh immediate death; and wishing to defend them as much\r\nas in me lies from this second death, and to preserve them as long as\r\nmay be possible in the memory of the living; and having spent much time\r\nin seeking them out and used the greatest diligence in discovering the\r\nnative city, the origin, and the actions of the craftsmen, and having\r\nwith great labour drawn them from the tales of old men and from various\r\nrecords and writings, left by their heirs a prey to dust and food for\r\nworms; and finally, having received from this both profit and pleasure,\r\nI have judged it expedient, nay rather, my duty, to make for them\r\nwhatsoever memorial my weak talents and my small judgment may be able to\r\nmake. In honour, then, of those who are already dead, and for the\r\nbenefit, for the most part, of all the followers of these three most\r\nexcellent arts, Architecture, Sculpture, and Painting, I will write the\r\nLives of the craftsmen of each according to the times wherein they\r\nlived, step by step from Cimabue down to our own time; not touching on\r\nthe ancients save in so far as it may concern our subject, seeing that\r\nno more can be said of them than those so many writers have said who\r\nhave come down to our own age. I will treat thoroughly of many things\r\nthat appertain to the science of one or other of the said arts; but\r\nbefore I come to the secrets of these, or to the history of the\r\ncraftsmen, it seems to me right to touch a little on a dispute, born and\r\nbred between many without reason, as to the sovereignty and nobility,\r\nnot of architecture, which they have left on one side, but of sculpture\r\nand painting; there being advanced, on one side and on the other, many\r\narguments whereof many, if not all, are worthy to be heard and discussed\r\nby their craftsmen.\r\n\r\nI say, then, that the sculptors, as being endowed, perchance by nature\r\nand by the exercise of their art, with a better habit of body, with more\r\nblood, and with more energy, and being thereby more hardy and more fiery\r\nthan the painters, in seeking to give the highest rank to their art,\r\nargue and prove the nobility of sculpture primarily from its antiquity,\r\nfor the reason that God Almighty made man, who was the first statue; and\r\nthey say that sculpture embraces many more arts as kindred, and has many\r\nmore of them subordinate to itself than has painting, such as\r\nlow-relief, working in clay, wax, plaster, wood, and ivory, casting in\r\nmetals, every kind of chasing, engraving and carving in relief on fine\r\nstones and steel, and many others which both in number and in difficulty\r\nsurpass those of painting. And alleging, further, that those things\r\nwhich stand longest and best against time and can be preserved longest\r\nfor the use of men, for whose benefit and service they are made, are\r\nwithout doubt more useful and more worthy to be held in love and honour\r\nthan are the others, they maintain that sculpture is by so much more\r\nnoble than painting as it is more easy to preserve, both itself and the\r\nnames of all who are honoured by it both in marble and in bronze,\r\nagainst all the ravages of time and air, than is painting, which, by its\r\nvery nature, not to say by external accidents, perishes in the most\r\nsheltered and most secure places that architects have been able to\r\nprovide. Nay more, they insist that the small number not merely of their\r\nexcellent but even of their ordinary craftsmen, in contrast to the\r\ninfinite number of the painters, proves their greater nobility; saying\r\nthat sculpture calls for a certain better disposition, both of mind and\r\nof body, that are rarely found together, whereas painting contents\r\nitself with any feeble temperament, so long as it has a hand, if not\r\nbold, at least sure; and that this their contention is proved by the\r\ngreater prices cited in particular by Pliny, by the loves caused by the\r\nmarvellous beauty of certain statues, and by the judgment of him who\r\nmade the statue of sculpture of gold and that of painting of silver, and\r\nplaced the first on the right and the second on the left. Nor do they\r\neven refrain from quoting the difficulties experienced before the\r\nmaterials, such as the marbles and the metals, can be got into\r\nsubjection, and their value, in contrast to the ease of obtaining the\r\npanels, the canvases, and the colours, for the smallest prices and in\r\nevery place; and further, the extreme and grievous labour of handling\r\nthe marbles and the bronzes, through their weight, and of working them,\r\nthrough the weight of the tools, in contrast to the lightness of the\r\nbrushes, of the styles, and of the pens, chalk-holders, and charcoals;\r\nbesides this, that they exhaust their minds together with all the parts\r\nof their bodies, which is something very serious compared with the quiet\r\nand light work of the painter, using only his mind and hand. Moreover,\r\nthey lay very great stress on the fact that things are more noble and\r\nmore perfect in proportion as they approach more nearly to the truth,\r\nand they say that sculpture imitates the true form and shows its works\r\non every side and from every point of view, whereas painting, being\r\nlaid on flat with most simple strokes of the brush and having but one\r\nlight, shows but one aspect; and many of them do not scruple to say that\r\nsculpture is as much superior to painting as is truth to falsehood. But\r\nas their last and strongest argument, they allege that for the sculptor\r\nthere is necessary a perfection of judgment not only ordinary, as for\r\nthe painter, but absolute and immediate, in a manner that it may see\r\nwithin the marble the exact whole of that figure which they intend to\r\ncarve from it, and may be able to make many parts perfect without any\r\nother model before it combines and unites them together, as Michelagnolo\r\nhas done divinely well; although, for lack of this happiness of\r\njudgment, they make easily and often some of those blunders which have\r\nno remedy, and which, when made, bear witness for ever to the slips of\r\nthe chisel or to the small judgment of the sculptor. This never happens\r\nto painters, for the reason that at every slip of the brush or error of\r\njudgment that might befall them they have time, recognizing it\r\nthemselves or being told by others, to cover and patch it up with the\r\nvery brush that made it; which brush, in their hands, has this advantage\r\nover the sculptor's chisels, that it not only heals, as did the iron of\r\nthe spear of Achilles, but leaves its wounds without a scar.\r\n\r\nTo these things the painters, answering not without disdain, say, in the\r\nfirst place, that if the sculptors wish to discuss the matter on the\r\nground of the Scriptures the chief nobility is their own, and that the\r\nsculptors deceive themselves very grievously in claiming as their work\r\nthe statue of our first father, which was made of earth; for the art of\r\nthis performance, both in its putting on and in its taking off, belongs\r\nno less to the painters than to others, and was called \"plastice\" by the\r\nGreeks and \"fictoria\" by the Latins, and was judged by Praxiteles to be\r\nthe mother of sculpture, of casting, and of chasing, a fact which makes\r\nsculpture, in truth, the niece of painting, seeing that \"plastice\" and\r\npainting are born at one and the same moment from design. And they say\r\nthat if we consider it apart from the Scriptures, the opinions of the\r\nages are so many and so varied that it is difficult to believe one more\r\nthan the other; and that finally, considering this nobility as they\r\nwish it, in one place they lose and in the other they do not win, as may\r\nbe seen more clearly in the Preface to the Lives.\r\n\r\nAfter this, in comparison with the arts related and subordinate to\r\nsculpture, they say that they have many more than the sculptors, because\r\npainting embraces the invention of history, the most difficult art of\r\nforeshortening, all the branches of architecture needful for the making\r\nof buildings, perspective, colouring in distemper, and the art of\r\nworking in fresco, an art different and distinct from all the others;\r\nlikewise working in oils on wood, on stone, and on canvas; illumination,\r\ntoo, an art different from all the others; the staining of glass,\r\nmosaics in glass, the art of inlaying and making pictures with coloured\r\nwoods, which is painting; making sgraffito[2] work on houses with iron\r\ntools; niello[3] work and printing from copper, both members of\r\npainting; goldsmith's enamelling, and the inlaying of gold for\r\ndamascening; the painting of glazed figures, and the making on\r\nearthenware vessels of scenes and figures to resist the action of water;\r\nweaving brocades with figures and flowers, and that most beautiful\r\ninvention, woven tapestries, that are both convenient and magnificent,\r\nbeing able to carry painting into every place, whether savage or\r\ncivilized; not to mention that in every department of art that has to be\r\npractised, design, which is our design, is used by all; so that the\r\nmembers of painting are more numerous and more useful than those of\r\nsculpture. They do not deny the eternity, for so the others call it, of\r\nsculpture, but they say that this is no privilege that should make the\r\nart more noble than it is by nature, seeing that it comes simply from\r\nthe material, and that if length of life were to give nobility to souls,\r\nthe pine, among the plants, and the stag, among the animals, would have\r\na soul more noble beyond compare than that of men; although they could\r\nclaim a similar immortality and nobility in their mosaics, seeing that\r\nthere may be seen some as ancient as the most ancient sculptures that\r\nare in Rome, and that they used to be made of jewels and fine stones.\r\nAnd as for their small or smaller number, they declare that this is not\r\nbecause the art calls for a better habit of body and greater judgment,\r\nbut that it depends wholly on the poverty of their resources and on the\r\nlittle favour, or avarice, as we would rather call it, of rich men, who\r\ngive them no supply of marble and no opportunity to work; in contrast\r\nwith what may be believed, nay, seen to have happened in ancient times,\r\nwhen sculpture rose to its greatest height. Indeed, it is manifest that\r\nhe who cannot use and waste a small quantity of marble and hard stone,\r\nwhich are very costly, cannot have that practice in the art that is\r\nessential; he who does not practise does not learn it; and he who does\r\nnot learn it can do no good. Wherefore they should rather excuse with\r\nthese arguments the imperfection and the small number of their masters,\r\nthan seek to deduce nobility from them under false colours. As for the\r\nhigher prices of sculptures, they answer that, although theirs might be\r\nmuch less, they have not to share them, being content with a boy who\r\ngrinds their colours and hands them their brushes or their cheap stools,\r\nwhereas the sculptors, besides the great cost of their material, require\r\nmany aids and spend more time on one single figure than they themselves\r\ndo on very many; wherefore their prices appear to come from the quality\r\nand the durability of the material itself, from the aids that it\r\nrequires for its completion, and from the time that is taken in working\r\nit, rather than from the excellence of the art itself. And although that\r\ndoes not suffice and no greater price is found, as would be easily seen\r\nby anyone who were willing to consider it diligently, let them find a\r\ngreater price than the marvellous, beautiful, and living gift that\r\nAlexander the Great made in return for the most splendid and excellent\r\nwork of Apelles, bestowing on him, not vast treasures or high estate,\r\nbut his own beloved and most beautiful Campaspe; let them observe, in\r\naddition, that Alexander was young, enamoured of her, and naturally\r\nsubject to the passions of love, and also both a King and a Greek; and\r\nthen, from this, let them draw what conclusion they please. As for the\r\nloves of Pygmalion and of those other rascals no more worthy to be men,\r\ncited as proof of the nobility of the art, they know not what to answer,\r\nif, from a very great blindness of intellect and from a licentiousness\r\nunbridled beyond all natural bounds, there can be made a proof of\r\nnobility. As for the man, whosoever he was, alleged by the sculptors to\r\nhave made sculpture of gold and painting of silver, they are agreed that\r\nif he had given as much sign of judgment as of wealth, there would be no\r\ndisputing it; and finally, they conclude that the ancient Golden Fleece,\r\nhowever celebrated it may be, none the less covered nothing but an\r\nunintelligent ram; wherefore neither the testimony of riches nor that of\r\ndishonest desires, but those of letters, of practice, of excellence, and\r\nof judgment are those to which we must pay attention. Nor do they make\r\nany answer to the difficulty of obtaining the marbles and the metals,\r\nsave this, that it springs from their own poverty and from the little\r\nfavour of the powerful, as has been said, and not from any degree of\r\ngreater nobility. To the extreme fatigues of the body and to the dangers\r\npeculiar to them and to their works, laughing and without any ado they\r\nanswer that if greater fatigues and dangers prove greater nobility, the\r\nart of quarrying the marbles from the bowels of mountains by means of\r\nwedges, levers, and hammers must be more noble than sculpture, that of\r\nthe blacksmith must surpass the goldsmith's, and that of masonry must be\r\nsuperior to architecture.\r\n\r\nThey say, next, that the true difficulties lie rather in the mind than\r\nin the body, wherefore those things that from their nature call for more\r\nstudy and knowledge are more noble and excellent than those that avail\r\nthemselves rather of strength of body; and they declare that since the\r\npainters rely more on the worth of the mind than the others, this\r\nhighest honour belongs to painting. For the sculptors the compasses and\r\nsquares suffice to discover and apply all the proportions and\r\nmeasurements whereof they have need; for the painters there is\r\nnecessary, besides the knowledge how to make good use of the aforesaid\r\ninstruments, an accurate understanding of perspective, for the reason\r\nthat they have to provide a thousand other things beyond landscapes and\r\nbuildings, not to mention that they must have greater judgment by reason\r\nof the quantity of the figures in one scene, wherein more errors can\r\ncome than in a single statue. For the sculptor it is enough to be\r\nacquainted with the true forms and features of solid and tangible\r\nbodies, subordinate on every side to the touch, and moreover of those\r\nonly that have something to support them. For the painter it is\r\nnecessary to know the forms not only of all the bodies supported and not\r\nsupported, but also of all those transparent and intangible; and besides\r\nthis they must know the colours that are suitable for the said bodies,\r\nwhereof the multitude and the variety, so absolute and admitting of such\r\ninfinite extension, are demonstrated better by the flowers, the fruits,\r\nand the minerals than by anything else; and this knowledge is supremely\r\ndifficult to acquire and to maintain, by reason of their infinite\r\nvariety. They say, moreover, that whereas sculpture, through the\r\nstubbornness and the imperfection of the material, does not represent\r\nthe emotions of the soul save with motion, which does not, however, find\r\nmuch scope therein, and with the mere shape of the limbs and not even of\r\nall these; the painters demonstrate them with all the forms of motion,\r\nwhich are infinite, with the shape of the limbs, however subtle they may\r\nbe, and even with breath itself and the spiritual essence of sight; and\r\nthat, for greater perfection in demonstrating not only the passions and\r\nemotions of the soul but also the events of the future, as living men\r\ndo, they must have, besides long practice in the art, a complete\r\nunderstanding of physiognomy, whereof that part suffices for the\r\nsculptor which deals with the quantity and the quality of the members,\r\nwithout troubling about the quality of colours, as to the knowledge of\r\nwhich anyone who judges by the eye knows how useful and necessary it is\r\nfor the true imitation of nature, whereunto the closer a man approaches\r\nthe more perfect he is.\r\n\r\nAfter this they add that whereas sculpture, taking away bit by bit, at\r\none and the same time gives depth to and acquires relief for those\r\nthings that have solidity by their own nature, and makes use of touch\r\nand sight, the painters, in two distinct actions, give relief and depth\r\nto a flat surface with the help of one single sense; and this, when it\r\nhas been done by a person intelligent in the art, has caused many great\r\nmen, not to speak of animals, to stand fast in the most pleasing\r\nillusion, which has never been seen to be done by sculpture, for the\r\nreason that it does not imitate nature in a manner that may be called\r\nas perfect as their own. And finally, in answer to that complete and\r\nabsolute perfection of judgment which is required for sculpture, by\r\nreason of its having no means to add where it takes away; declaring,\r\nfirst, that such mistakes are irreparable, as the others say, and not to\r\nbe remedied save by patches, which, even as in garments they are signs\r\nof poverty of wardrobe, so too both in sculpture and in pictures are\r\nsigns of poverty of intellect and judgment; and saying, further, that\r\npatience, at its own leisure, by means of models, protractors, squares,\r\ncompasses, and a thousand other devices and instruments for enlarging,\r\nnot only preserves them from mistakes but enables them to bring their\r\nwhole work to its perfection; they conclude, then, that this difficulty\r\nwhich they put down as the greater is nothing or little when compared to\r\nthose which the painters have when working in fresco, and that the said\r\nperfection of judgment is in no way more necessary for sculptors than\r\nfor painters, it being sufficient for the former to execute good models\r\nin wax, clay, or something else, even as the latter make their drawings\r\non corresponding materials or on cartoons; and that finally, the quality\r\nthat little by little transfers their models to the marble is rather\r\npatience than aught else.\r\n\r\nBut let us consider about judgment, as the sculptors wish, and see\r\nwhether it is not more necessary to one who works in fresco than to one\r\nwho chisels in marble. For here not only is there no place for patience\r\nor for time, which are most mortal enemies to the union of the plaster\r\nand the colours, but the eye does not see the true colours until the\r\nplaster is well dry, nor can the hand judge of anything but of the soft\r\nor the dry, in a manner that anyone who were to call it working in the\r\ndark, or with spectacles of colours different from the truth, would not\r\nin my belief be very far wrong. Nay, I do not doubt at all that such a\r\nname is more suitable for it than for intaglio, for which wax serves as\r\nspectacles both true and good. They say, too, that for this work it is\r\nnecessary to have a resolute judgment, to foresee the end in the fresh\r\nplaster and how the work will turn out on the dry; besides that the work\r\ncannot be abandoned so long as the plaster is still fresh, and that it\r\nis necessary to do resolutely in one day what sculpture does in a month.\r\nAnd if a man has not this judgment and this excellence, there are seen,\r\non the completion of his work or in time, patches, blotches,\r\ncorrections, and colours superimposed or retouched on the dry, which is\r\nsomething of the vilest, because afterwards mould appears and reveals\r\nthe insufficiency and the small knowledge of the craftsmen, even as the\r\npieces added in sculpture lead to ugliness; not to mention that when it\r\ncomes about that the figures in fresco are washed, as is often done\r\nafter some time to restore them, what has been worked on the fresh\r\nplaster remains, and what has been retouched on the dry is carried away\r\nby the wet sponge.\r\n\r\nThey add, moreover, that whereas the sculptors make two figures\r\ntogether, or at the most three, from one block of marble, they make many\r\nof them on one single panel, with all those so many and so varied\r\naspects which the sculptors claim for one single statue, compensating\r\nwith the variety of their postures, foreshortenings, and attitudes, for\r\nthe fact that the work of the sculptors can be seen from every side;\r\neven as Giorgione da Castelfranco did once in one of his pictures,\r\nwherein a figure with its back turned, having a mirror on either side,\r\nand a pool of water at its feet, shows its back in the painting, its\r\nfront in the pool, and its sides in the mirrors, which is something that\r\nsculpture has never been able to do. In addition to this, they maintain\r\nthat painting leaves not one of the elements unadorned and not abounding\r\nwith all the excellent things that nature has bestowed on them, giving\r\nits own light and its own darkness to the air, with all its varieties of\r\nfeeling, and filling it with all the kinds of birds together; to water,\r\nits clearness, the fishes, the mosses, the foam, the undulations of the\r\nwaves, the ships, and all its various moods; and to the earth, the\r\nmountains, the plains, the plants, the fruits, the flowers, the animals,\r\nand the buildings; with so great a multitude of things and so great a\r\nvariety of their forms and of their true colours, that nature herself\r\nmany a time stands in a marvel thereat; and finally, giving to fire so\r\nmuch of its heat and light that it is clearly seen burning things, and,\r\nalmost quivering with its flames, rendering luminous in part the\r\nthickest darkness of the night. Wherefore it appears to them that they\r\ncan justly conclude and declare that contrasting the difficulties of the\r\nsculptors with their own, the labours of the body with those of the\r\nmind, the imitation of the mere form with the imitation of the\r\nimpression, both of quantity and of quality, that strikes the eye, the\r\nsmall number of the subjects wherein sculpture can and does demonstrate\r\nits excellence with the infinite number of those which painting presents\r\nto us (not to mention the perfect preservation of them for the intellect\r\nand the distribution of them in those places wherein nature herself has\r\nnot done so); and finally, weighing the whole content of the one with\r\nthat of the other, the nobility of sculpture, as shown by the intellect,\r\nthe invention, and the judgment of its craftsmen, does not correspond by\r\na great measure to that which painting enjoys and deserves. And this is\r\nall that on the one side and on the other has come to my ears that is\r\nworthy of consideration.\r\n\r\nBut because it appears to me that the sculptors have spoken with too\r\nmuch heat and the painters with too much disdain, and seeing that I have\r\nlong enough studied the works of sculpture and have ever exercised\r\nmyself in painting, however small, perhaps, may be the fruit that is to\r\nbe seen of it; none the less, by reason of that which it is worth, and\r\nby reason of the undertaking of these writings, judging it my duty to\r\ndemonstrate the judgment that I have ever made of it in my own mind (and\r\nmay my authority avail the most that it can), I will declare my opinion\r\nsurely and briefly over such a dispute, being convinced that I will not\r\nincur any charge of presumption or of ignorance, seeing that I will not\r\ntreat of the arts of others, as many have done before to the end that\r\nthey might appear to the crowd intelligent in all things by means of\r\nletters, and as happened, among others, to Phormio the Peripatetic of\r\nEphesus, who, in order to display his eloquence, lecturing and making\r\ndisputation about the virtues and parts of the excellent captain, made\r\nHannibal laugh not less at his presumption than at his ignorance.\r\n\r\nI say, then, that sculpture and painting are in truth sisters, born from\r\none father, that is, design, at one and the same birth, and have no\r\nprecedence one over the other, save insomuch as the worth and the\r\nstrength of those who maintain them make one craftsman surpass another,\r\nand not by reason of any difference or degree of nobility that is in\r\ntruth to be found between them. And although by reason of the diversity\r\nof their essence they have many different advantages, these are neither\r\nso great nor of such a kind that they do not come exactly into balance\r\ntogether and that we do not perceive the infatuation or the obstinacy,\r\nrather than the judgment, of those who wish one to surpass the other.\r\nWherefore it may be said with reason that one and the same soul rules\r\nthe bodies of both, and by reason of this I conclude that those do evil\r\nwho strive to disunite and to separate the one from the other. Heaven,\r\nwishing to undeceive us in this matter and to show us the kinship and\r\nunion of these two most noble arts, has raised up in our midst at\r\nvarious times many sculptors who have painted and many painters who have\r\nworked in sculpture, as will be seen in the Life of Antonio del\r\nPollaiuolo, of Leonardo da Vinci, and of many others long since passed\r\naway. But in our own age the Divine Goodness has created for us\r\nMichelagnolo Buonarroti, in whom both these arts shine forth so perfect\r\nand appear so similar and so closely united, that the painters marvel at\r\nhis pictures and the sculptors feel for the sculptures wrought by him\r\nsupreme admiration and reverence. On him, to the end that he might not\r\nperchance need to seek from some other master some convenient\r\nresting-place for the figures that he wrought, nature has bestowed so\r\ngenerously the science of architecture, that without having need of\r\nothers he has strength and power within himself to give to this or the\r\nother image made by himself an honourable and suitable resting-place, in\r\na manner that he rightly deserves to be called the king of sculptors,\r\nthe prince of painters, and the most excellent of architects, nay\r\nrather, of architecture the true master. And indeed we can affirm with\r\ncertainty that those do in no way err who call him divine, seeing that\r\nhe has within his own self embraced the three arts most worthy of praise\r\nand most ingenious that are to be found among mortal men, and that with\r\nthese, after the manner of a God, he can give us infinite delight. And\r\nlet this suffice for the dispute raised between the factions, and for\r\nour own opinion.\r\n\r\nNow, returning to my first intention, I say that, wishing in so far as\r\nit lies within the reach of my powers to drag from the ravening maw of\r\ntime, the names of the sculptors, painters, and architects, who, from\r\nCimabue to the present day, have been of some notable excellence in\r\nItaly, and desiring that this my labour may be no less useful than it\r\nhas been pleasant to me in the undertaking, it appears to me necessary,\r\nbefore we come to the history, to make as briefly as may be an\r\nintroduction to these three arts, wherein those were valiant of whom I\r\nam to write the Lives, to the end that every gracious spirit may first\r\nlearn the most notable things in their professions, and afterwards may\r\nbe able with greater pleasure and benefit to see clearly in what they\r\nwere different among themselves, and how great adornment and convenience\r\nthey give to their countries and to all who wish to avail themselves of\r\ntheir industry and knowledge.\r\n\r\nI will begin, then, with architecture, as the most universal and the\r\nmost necessary and useful to men, and as that for the service and\r\nadornment of which the two others exist; and I will expound briefly the\r\nvarieties of stone, the manners or methods of construction, with their\r\nproportions, and how one may recognize buildings that are good and\r\nwell-conceived. Afterwards, discoursing of sculpture, I will tell how\r\nstatues are wrought, the form and the proportion that are looked for in\r\nthem, and of what kind are good sculptures, with all the most secret and\r\nmost necessary precepts. Finally, treating of painting, I will speak of\r\ndraughtsmanship, of the methods of colouring, of the perfect execution\r\nof any work, of the quality of the pictures themselves, and of\r\nwhatsoever thing appertains to painting; of every kind of mosaic, of\r\nniello, of enamelling, of damascening, and then, lastly, of the printing\r\nof pictures. And in this way I am convinced that these my labours will\r\ndelight those who are not engaged in these pursuits, and will both\r\ndelight and help those who have made them a profession. For not to\r\nmention that in the Introduction they will review the methods of\r\nworking, and that in the Lives of the craftsmen themselves they will\r\nlearn where their works are, and how to recognize easily their\r\nperfection or imperfection and to discriminate between one manner and\r\nanother, they will also be able to perceive how much praise and honour\r\nthat man deserves who adds upright ways and goodness of life to the\r\nexcellencies of arts so noble. Kindled by the praise that those so\r\nconstituted have obtained, they too will aspire to true glory. Nor will\r\nlittle fruit be gathered from the history, true guide and mistress of\r\nour actions, in reading of the infinite variety of innumerable accidents\r\nthat befell the craftsmen, sometimes by their own fault and very often\r\nby chance.\r\n\r\nIt remains for me to make excuse for having on occasion used some words\r\nof indifferent Tuscan, whereof I do not wish to speak, having ever taken\r\nthought to use rather the words and names particular and proper to our\r\narts than the delicate or choice words of precious writers. Let me be\r\nallowed, then, to use in their proper speech the words proper to our\r\ncraftsmen, and let all content themselves with my good will, which has\r\nbestirred itself to produce this result not in order to teach to others\r\nwhat I do not know myself, but through a desire to preserve this memory\r\nat least of the most celebrated craftsmen, seeing that in so many\r\ndecades I have not yet been able to see one who has made much record of\r\nthem. For I have wished with these my rough labours, adumbrating their\r\nnoble deeds, to repay to them in some measure the debt that I owe to\r\ntheir works, which have been to me as masters for the learning of\r\nwhatsoever I know, rather than, living in sloth, to be a malignant\r\ncritic of the works of others, blaming and decrying them as men are\r\noften wont to do. But it is now time to come to our business.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The process of sgraffito work is described in Professor\r\nBaldwin Brown's notes to \"Vasari on Technique\" as follows: \"A wall is\r\ncovered with a layer of tinted plaster, and on this is superimposed a\r\nthin coating of white plaster. This outer coating is scratched through\r\n(with an iron tool), and the colour behind is revealed. Then all the\r\nsurface outside the design is cut away, and a cameo-like effect is given\r\nto the design.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The process of niello is as follows: A design is engraved\r\non silver or bronze, and the lines of the design are filled with a\r\ncomposition of silver and lead. On the application of fire to the whole,\r\nthis composition turns black, leaving the design strongly outlined.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE LIVES\r\n\r\n\r\nI have no manner of doubt that it is with almost all writers a common\r\nand deeply-fixed opinion that sculpture and painting together were first\r\ndiscovered, by the light of nature, by the people of Egypt, and that\r\nthere are certain others who attribute to the Chaldaeans the first rough\r\nsketches in marble and the first reliefs in statuary, even as they also\r\ngive to the Greeks the invention of the brush and of colouring. But I\r\nwill surely say that of both one and the other of these arts the design,\r\nwhich is their foundation, nay rather, the very soul that conceives and\r\nnourishes within itself all the parts of man's intellect, was already\r\nmost perfect before the creation of all other things, when the Almighty\r\nGod, having made the great body of the world and having adorned the\r\nheavens with their exceeding bright lights, descended lower with His\r\nintellect into the clearness of the air and the solidity of the earth,\r\nand, shaping man, discovered, together with the lovely creation of all\r\nthings, the first form of sculpture; from which man afterwards, step by\r\nstep (and this may not be denied), as from a true pattern, there were\r\ntaken statues, sculptures, and the science of pose and of outline; and\r\nfor the first pictures (whatsoever they were), softness, harmony, and\r\nthe concord in discord that comes from light and shade. Thus, then, the\r\nfirst model whence there issued the first image of man was a lump of\r\nclay, and not without reason, seeing that the Divine Architect of time\r\nand of nature, being Himself most perfect, wished to show in the\r\nimperfection of the material the way to add and to take away; in the\r\nsame manner wherein the good sculptors and painters are wont to work,\r\nwho, adding and taking away in their models, bring their imperfect\r\nsketches to that final perfection which they desire. He gave to man that\r\nmost vivid colour of flesh, whence afterwards there were drawn for\r\npainting, from the mines of the earth, the colours themselves for the\r\ncounterfeiting of all those things that are required for pictures. It is\r\ntrue, indeed, that it cannot be affirmed for certain what was made by\r\nthe men before the Flood in these arts in imitation of so beautiful a\r\nwork, although it is reasonable to believe that they too carved and\r\npainted in every manner; seeing that Belus, son of the proud Nimrod,\r\nabout 200 years after the Flood, caused to be made that statue wherefrom\r\nthere was afterwards born idolatry, and his son's wife, the very famous\r\nSemiramis, Queen of Babylon, in the building of that city, placed among\r\nits adornments not only diverse varied kinds of animals, portrayed and\r\ncoloured from nature, but also the image of herself and of Ninus, her\r\nhusband, and, moreover, statues in bronze of her husband's father, of\r\nher husband's mother, and of the mother of the latter, as Diodorus\r\nrelates, calling them by the Greek names (that did not yet exist), Jove,\r\nJuno, and Ops. From these statues, perchance, the Chaldaeans learnt to\r\nmake the images of their gods, seeing that 150 years later Rachel, in\r\nflying from Mesopotamia together with Jacob her husband, stole the idols\r\nof Laban her father, as is clearly related in Genesis. Nor, indeed, were\r\nthe Chaldaeans alone in making sculptures and pictures, but the Egyptians\r\nmade them also, exercising themselves in these arts with that so great\r\nzeal which is shown in the marvellous tomb of the most ancient King\r\nOsimandyas, copiously described by Diodorus, and proved by the stern\r\ncommandment made by Moses in the Exodus from Egypt, namely, that under\r\npain of death there should be made to God no image whatsoever. He, on\r\ndescending from the mountain, having found the golden calf wrought and\r\nadored solemnly by his people, and being greatly perturbed to see Divine\r\nhonours paid to the image of a beast, not only broke it and reduced it\r\nto powder, but for punishment of so great a sin caused many thousands of\r\nthe wicked sons of Israel to be slain by the Levites. But because not\r\nthe making of statues but their adoration was a deadly sin, we read in\r\nExodus that the art of design and of statuary, not only in marble but in\r\nevery kind of metal, was bestowed by the mouth of God on Bezaleel, of\r\nthe tribe of Judah, and on Aholiab, of the tribe of Dan, who were those\r\nthat made the two cherubim of gold, the candlesticks, the veil, the\r\nborders of the priestly vestments, and so many other most beautiful\r\ncastings for the Tabernacle, for no other reason than to bring the\r\npeople to contemplate and to adore them.\r\n\r\nFrom the things seen before the Flood, then, the pride of men found the\r\nway to make the statues of those for whom they wished that they should\r\nremain famous and immortal in the world. And the Greeks, who think\r\ndifferently about this origin, say that the Ethiopians invented the\r\nfirst statues, as Diodorus tells; that the Egyptians took them from the\r\nEthiopians, and, from them, the Greeks; for by Homer's time sculpture\r\nand painting are seen to have been perfected, as it is proved, in\r\ndiscoursing of the shield of Achilles, by that divine poet, who shows it\r\nto us carved and painted, rather than described, with every form of art.\r\nLactantius Firmianus, by way of fable, attributes it to Prometheus, who,\r\nin the manner of Almighty God, shaped man's image out of mud; and from\r\nhim, he declares, the art of statuary came. But according to what Pliny\r\nwrites, this came to Egypt from Gyges the Lydian, who, being by the fire\r\nand gazing at his own shadow, suddenly, with some charcoal in his hand,\r\ndrew his own outline on the wall. And from that age, for a time,\r\noutlines only were wont to be used, with no body of colour, as the same\r\nPliny confirms; which method was rediscovered with more labour by\r\nPhilocles the Egyptian, and likewise by Cleanthes and Ardices of Corinth\r\nand by Telephanes of Sicyon.\r\n\r\nCleophantes of Corinth was the first among the Greeks who used colours,\r\nand Apollodorus the first who discovered the brush. There followed\r\nPolygnotus of Thasos, Zeuxis, and Timagoras of Chalcis, with Pythias and\r\nAglaophon, all most celebrated; and after these the most famous Apelles,\r\nso much esteemed and honoured by Alexander the Great for his talent, and\r\nthe most ingenious investigator of slander and false favour, as Lucian\r\nshows us; even as almost all the excellent painters and sculptors were\r\nendowed by Heaven, in nearly every case, not only with the adornment of\r\npoetry, as may be read of Pacuvius, but with philosophy besides, as may\r\nbe seen in Metrodorus, who, being as well versed in philosophy as in\r\npainting, was sent by the Athenians to Paulus Emilius to adorn his\r\ntriumph, and remained with him to read philosophy to his sons.\r\n\r\nThe art of sculpture, then, was greatly exercised in Greece, and there\r\nappeared many excellent craftsmen, and, among others, Pheidias, an\r\nAthenian, with Praxiteles and Polycletus, all very great masters, while\r\nLysippus and Pyrgoteles were excellent in sunk reliefs, and Pygmalion in\r\nreliefs in ivory, of whom there is a fable that by his prayers he\r\nobtained breath and spirit for the figure of a virgin that he made.\r\nPainting, likewise, was honoured and rewarded by the ancient Greeks and\r\nRomans, seeing that to those who made it appear marvellous they showed\r\nfavour by bestowing on them citizenship and the highest dignities. So\r\ngreatly did this art flourish in Rome that Fabius gave renown to his\r\nhouse by writing his name under the things so beautifully painted by him\r\nin the temple of Salus, and calling himself Fabius Pictor. It was\r\nforbidden by public decree that slaves should exercise this art\r\nthroughout the cities, and so much honour did the nations pay without\r\nceasing to the art and to the craftsmen that the rarest works were sent\r\namong the triumphal spoils, as marvellous things, to Rome, and the\r\nfinest craftsmen were freed from slavery and recompensed with honours\r\nand rewards by the commonwealths.\r\n\r\nThe Romans themselves bore so great reverence for these arts that\r\nbesides the respect that Marcellus, in sacking the city of Syracuse,\r\ncommanded to be paid to a craftsman famous in them, in planning the\r\nassault of the aforesaid city they took care not to set fire to that\r\nquarter wherein there was a most beautiful painted panel, which was\r\nafterwards carried to Rome in the triumph, with much pomp. Thither,\r\nhaving, so to speak, despoiled the world, in course of time they\r\nassembled the craftsmen themselves as well as their finest works,\r\nwherewith afterwards Rome became so beautiful, for the reason that she\r\ngained so great adornment from the statues from abroad more than from\r\nher own native ones; it being known that in Rhodes, the city of an\r\nisland in no way large, there were more than 30,000 statues counted,\r\neither in bronze or in marble, nor did the Athenians have less, while\r\nthose at Olympia and at Delphi were many more and those in Corinth\r\nnumberless, and all were most beautiful and of the greatest value. Is\r\nit not known that Nicomedes, King of Lycia, in his eagerness for a Venus\r\nthat was by the hand of Praxiteles, spent on it almost all the wealth of\r\nhis people? Did not Attalus the same, who, in order to possess the\r\npicture of Bacchus painted by Aristides, did not scruple to spend on it\r\nmore than 6,000 sesterces? Which picture was placed by Lucius Mummius in\r\nthe temple of Ceres with the greatest pomp, in order to adorn Rome.\r\n\r\nBut for all that the nobility of these arts was so highly valued, it is\r\nnone the less not yet known for certain who gave them their first\r\nbeginning. For, as has been already said above, it appears most ancient\r\namong the Chaldaeans, some give it to the Ethiopians, and the Greeks\r\nattribute it to themselves; and it may be thought, not without reason,\r\nthat it is perchance even more ancient among the Etruscans, as our Leon\r\nBatista Alberti testifies, whereof we have clear enough proof in the\r\nmarvellous tomb of Porsena at Chiusi, where, no long time since, there\r\nwere discovered underground, between the walls of the Labyrinth, some\r\nterracotta tiles with figures on them in half-relief, so excellent and\r\nin so beautiful a manner that it can be easily recognized that the art\r\nwas not begun precisely at that time, nay rather, by reason of the\r\nperfection of these works, that it was much nearer its height than its\r\nbeginning. To this, moreover, witness is likewise borne by our seeing\r\nevery day many pieces of those red and black vases of Arezzo, made, as\r\nmay be judged from the manner, about those times, with the most delicate\r\ncarvings and small figures and scenes in low-relief, and many small\r\nround masks wrought with great subtlety by masters of that age, men most\r\nexperienced, as is shown by the effect, and most excellent in that art.\r\nIt may be seen, moreover, by reason of the statues found at Viterbo at\r\nthe beginning of the pontificate of Alexander VI, that sculpture was in\r\ngreat esteem and in no small perfection among the Etruscans; and\r\nalthough it is not known precisely at what time they were made, it may\r\nbe reasonably conjectured, both from the manner of the figures and from\r\nthe style of the tombs and of the buildings, no less than from the\r\ninscriptions in those Etruscan letters, that they are most ancient and\r\nwere made at a time when the affairs of this country were in a good and\r\nprosperous state. But what clearer proof of this can be sought? seeing\r\nthat in our own day--that is, in the year 1554--there has been found a\r\nbronze figure of the Chimaera of Bellerophon, in making the ditches,\r\nfortifications, and walls of Arezzo, from which figure it is recognized\r\nthat the perfection of that art existed in ancient times among the\r\nEtruscans, as may be seen from the Etruscan manner and still more from\r\nthe letters carved on a paw, about which--since they are but few and\r\nthere is no one now who understands the Etruscan tongue--it is\r\nconjectured that they may represent the name of the master as well as\r\nthat of the figure itself, and perchance also the date, according to the\r\nuse of those times. This figure, by reason of its beauty and antiquity,\r\nhas been placed in our day by the Lord Duke Cosimo in the hall of the\r\nnew rooms in his Palace, wherein there have been painted by me the acts\r\nof Pope Leo X. And besides this there were found in the same place many\r\nsmall figures in bronze after the same manner, which are in the hands of\r\nthe said Lord Duke.\r\n\r\nBut since the dates of the works of the Greeks, the Ethiopians, and the\r\nChaldaeans are as doubtful as our own, and perhaps more, and by reason of\r\nthe greater need of founding our judgment about these works on\r\nconjectures, which, however, are not so feeble that they are in every\r\nway wide of the mark, I believe that I strayed not at all from the truth\r\n(and I think that everyone who will consent to consider this question\r\ndiscreetly will judge as I did), when I said above that the origin of\r\nthese arts was nature herself, and the example or model, the most\r\nbeautiful fabric of the world, and the master, that divine light infused\r\nby special grace into us, which has not only made us superior to the\r\nother animals, but, if it be not sin to say it, like to God. And if in\r\nour own times it has been seen (as I trust to be able to demonstrate a\r\nlittle later by many examples) that simple children roughly reared in\r\nthe woods, with their only model in the beautiful pictures and\r\nsculptures of nature, and by the vivacity of their wit, have begun by\r\nthemselves to make designs, how much more may we, nay, must we\r\nconfidently believe that these primitive men, who, in proportion as they\r\nwere less distant from their origin and divine creation, were thereby\r\nthe more perfect and of better intelligence, that they, by themselves,\r\nhaving for guide nature, for master purest intellect, and for example\r\nthe so lovely model of the world, gave birth to these most noble arts,\r\nand from a small beginning, little by little bettering them, brought\r\nthem at last to perfection? I do not, indeed, wish to deny that there\r\nwas one among them who was the first to begin, seeing that I know very\r\nwell that it must needs be that at some time and from some one man there\r\ncame the beginning; nor, also, will I deny that it may have been\r\npossible that one helped another and taught and opened the way to\r\ndesign, to colour, and relief, because I know that our art is all\r\nimitation, of nature for the most part and then, because a man cannot by\r\nhimself rise so high, of those works that are executed by those whom he\r\njudges to be better masters than himself. But I say surely that the\r\nwishing to affirm dogmatically who this man or these men were is a thing\r\nvery perilous to judge, and perchance little necessary to know, provided\r\nthat we see the true root and origin wherefrom art was born. For since,\r\nof the works that are the life and the glory of the craftsmen, the first\r\nand step by step the second and the third were lost by reason of time,\r\nthat consumes all things, and since, for lack of writers at that time,\r\nthey could not, at least in that way, become known to posterity, their\r\ncraftsmen as well came to be forgotten. But when once the writers began\r\nto make record of things that were before their day, they could not\r\nspeak of those whereof they had not been able to have information, in a\r\nmanner that there came to be first with them those of whom the memory\r\nhad been the last to be lost. Even as the first of the poets, by common\r\nconsent, is said to be Homer, not because there were none before him,\r\nfor there were, although not so excellent, which is seen clearly from\r\nhis own works, but because of these early poets, whatever manner of men\r\nthey were, all knowledge had been lost quite 2,000 years before.\r\nHowever, leaving behind us this part, as too uncertain by reason of its\r\nantiquity, let us come to the clearer matters of their perfection, ruin,\r\nand restoration, or rather resurrection, whereof we will be able to\r\ndiscourse on much better grounds.\r\n\r\nI say, then, it being true indeed, that they began late in Rome, if the\r\nfirst figure was, as is said, the image of Ceres made of metal from the\r\ntreasure of Spurius Cassius, who, for conspiring to make himself King,\r\nwas put to death by his own father without any scruple; and that\r\nalthough the arts of sculpture and of painting continued up to the end\r\nof the twelve Caesars, they did not, however, continue in that perfection\r\nand excellence which they had enjoyed before, for it may be seen from\r\nthe edifices that the Emperors built in succession one after the other\r\nthat these arts, decaying from one day to another, were coming little by\r\nlittle to lose their whole perfection of design. And to this clear\r\ntestimony is borne by the works of sculpture and of architecture that\r\nwere wrought in the time of Constantine in Rome, and in particular the\r\ntriumphal arch raised for him by the Roman people near the Colosseum,\r\nwherein it is seen that in default of good masters they not only made\r\nuse of marble groups made at the time of Trajan, but also of the spoils\r\nbrought from various places to Rome. And whosoever knows that the votive\r\nofferings in the medallions, that is, the sculptures in half-relief, and\r\nlikewise the prisoners, and the large groups, and the columns, and the\r\nmouldings, and the other ornaments, whether made before or from spoils,\r\nare excellently wrought, knows also that the works which were made to\r\nfill up by the sculptors of that time are of the rudest, as also are\r\ncertain small groups with little figures in marble below the medallions,\r\nand the lowest base wherein there are certain victories, and certain\r\nrivers between the arches at the sides, which are very rude and so made\r\nthat it can be believed most surely that by that time the art of\r\nsculpture had begun to lose something of the good. And there had not yet\r\ncome the Goths and the other barbarous and outlandish peoples who\r\ndestroyed, together with Italy, all the finer arts. It is true, indeed,\r\nthat in the said times architecture had suffered less harm than the\r\nother arts of design had suffered, for in the bath that Constantine\r\nerected on the Lateran, in the entrance of the principal porch it may be\r\nseen, to say nothing of the porphyry columns, the capitals wrought in\r\nmarble, and the double bases taken from some other place and very well\r\ncarved, that the whole composition of the building is very well\r\nconceived; whereas, on the contrary, the stucco, the mosaics, and\r\ncertain incrustations on the walls made by masters of that time are not\r\nequal to those that he caused to be placed in the same bath, which were\r\ntaken for the most part from the temples of the heathen gods.\r\nConstantine, so it is said, did the same in the garden of AEquitius, in\r\nmaking the temple which he afterwards endowed and gave to the Christian\r\npriests. In like manner, the magnificent Church of S. Giovanni Laterano,\r\nerected by the same Emperor, can bear witness to the same--namely, that\r\nin his day sculpture had already greatly declined; for the image of the\r\nSaviour and the twelve Apostles in silver that he caused to be made were\r\nvery debased sculptures, wrought without art and with very little\r\ndesign. Besides this, whosoever examines with diligence the medals of\r\nConstantine and his image and other statues made by the sculptors of\r\nthat time, which are at the present day in the Campidoglio, may see\r\nclearly that they are very far removed from the perfection of the medals\r\nand statues of the other Emperors; and all this shows that long before\r\nthe coming of the Goths into Italy sculpture had greatly declined.\r\n\r\nArchitecture, as has been said, continued to maintain itself, if not so\r\nperfect, in a better state; nor is there reason to marvel at this,\r\nseeing that, as the great edifices were made almost wholly of spoils, it\r\nwas easy for the architects, in making the new, to imitate in great\r\nmeasure the old, which they had ever before their eyes, and that much\r\nmore easily than the sculptors could imitate the good figures of the\r\nancients, their art having wholly vanished. And that this is true is\r\nmanifest, because the Church of the Prince of the Apostles on the\r\nVatican was not rich save in columns, bases, capitals, architraves,\r\nmouldings, doors, and other incrustations and ornaments, which were all\r\ntaken from various places and from the edifices built most magnificently\r\nin earlier times. The same could be said of S. Croce in Gierusalemme,\r\nwhich Constantine erected at the entreaty of his mother Helena, of S.\r\nLorenzo without the walls of Rome, and of S. Agnesa, built by him at the\r\nrequest of Constantia, his daughter. And who does not know that the font\r\nwhich served for the baptism of both her and her sister was all adorned\r\nwith works wrought long before, and in particular with the porphyry\r\nbasin carved with most beautiful figures, with certain marble\r\ncandlesticks excellently carved with foliage, and with some boys in\r\nlow-relief that are truly most beautiful? In short, for these and many\r\nother reasons it is clear how much, in the time of Constantine,\r\nsculpture had already declined, and together with it the other finer\r\narts. And if anything was wanting to complete this ruin, it was supplied\r\nto them amply by the departure of Constantine from Rome, on his going to\r\nestablish the seat of the Empire at Byzantium; for the reason that he\r\ntook with him not only all the best sculptors and other craftsmen of\r\nthat age, whatsoever manner of men they were, but also an infinite\r\nnumber of statues and other works of sculpture, all most beautiful.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of Constantine, the Caesars whom he left in Italy,\r\nbuilding continually both in Rome and elsewhere, exerted themselves to\r\nmake their works as fine as they could; but, as may be seen, sculpture,\r\nas well as painting and architecture, went ever from bad to worse, and\r\nthis perchance came to pass because, when human affairs begin to\r\ndecline, they never cease to go ever lower and lower until such time as\r\nthey can grow no worse. So, too, it may be seen that although at the\r\ntime of Pope Liberius the architects of that day strove to do something\r\ngreat in constructing the Church of S. Maria Maggiore, they were yet not\r\nhappy in the success of the whole, for the reason that although that\r\nbuilding, which is likewise composed for the greater part of spoils, was\r\nmade with good enough proportions, it cannot be denied any the less, not\r\nto speak of certain other parts, that the frieze made right round above\r\nthe columns with ornaments in stucco and in painting is wholly wanting\r\nin design, and that many other things which are seen in that great\r\nchurch demonstrate the imperfection of the arts.\r\n\r\nMany years after, when the Christians were persecuted under Julian the\r\nApostate, there was erected on the C[oe]lian Mount a church to S. John\r\nand S. Paul, the martyrs, in a manner so much worse than those named\r\nabove, that it is seen clearly that the art was at that time little less\r\nthan wholly lost. The buildings, too, that were erected at the same time\r\nin Tuscany, bear most ample testimony to this; and not to speak of many\r\nothers, the church that was built outside the walls of Arezzo to S.\r\nDonatus, Bishop of that city (who, together with the monk Hilarian,\r\nsuffered martyrdom under the said Julian the Apostate), was in no way\r\nbetter in architecture than those named above. Nor can it be believed\r\nthat this came from anything else but the absence of better architects\r\nin that age, seeing that the said church (as it has been possible to see\r\nin our own day), which is octagonal and constructed from the spoils of\r\nthe Theatre, the Colosseum and other edifices that had been standing in\r\nArezzo before it was converted to the faith of Christ, was built without\r\nthought of economy and at the greatest cost, and adorned with columns of\r\ngranite, of porphyry, and of many-coloured marbles, which had belonged\r\nto the said buildings. And for myself I do not doubt, from the expense\r\nwhich was clearly bestowed on that church, that if the Aretines had had\r\nbetter architects they would have built something marvellous; for it may\r\nbe seen from what they did that they spared nothing if only they might\r\nmake that work as rich and as well designed as they possibly could, and\r\nsince, as has been already said so many times, architecture had lost\r\nless of its perfection than the other arts, there was to be seen therein\r\nsome little of the good. At this time, likewise, was enlarged the Church\r\nof S. Maria in Grado, in honour of the said Hilarian, for the reason\r\nthat he had been for a long time living in it when he went, with\r\nDonatus, to the crown of martyrdom.\r\n\r\nBut because Fortune, when she has brought men to the height of her\r\nwheel, is wont, either in jest or in repentance, to throw them down\r\nagain, it came about after these things that there rose up in various\r\nparts of the world all the barbarous peoples against Rome; whence there\r\nensued after no long time not only the humiliation of so great an Empire\r\nbut the ruin of the whole, and above all of Rome herself, and with her\r\nwere likewise utterly ruined the most excellent craftsmen, sculptors,\r\npainters, and architects, leaving the arts and their own selves buried\r\nand submerged among the miserable massacres and ruins of that most\r\nfamous city. And the first to fall into decay were painting and\r\nsculpture, as being arts that served more for pleasure than for use,\r\nwhile the other--namely, architecture--as being necessary and useful for\r\nbodily weal, continued to exist, but no longer in its perfection and\r\nexcellence. And if it had not been that the sculptures and pictures\r\npresented, to the eyes of those who were born from day to day, those who\r\nhad been thereby honoured to the end that they might have eternal life,\r\nthere would soon have been lost the memory of both; whereas some of\r\nthem survived in the images and in the inscriptions placed in private\r\nhouses, as well as in public buildings, namely, in the amphitheatres,\r\nthe theatres, the baths, the aqueducts, the temples, the obelisks, the\r\ncolossi, the pyramids, the arches, the reservoirs, the public\r\ntreasuries, and finally, in the very tombs, whereof a great part was\r\ndestroyed by a barbarous and savage race who had nothing in them of man\r\nbut the shape and the name. These, among others, were the Visigoths,\r\nwho, having created Alaric their King, assailed Italy and Rome and\r\nsacked the city twice without respect for anything whatsoever. The same,\r\ntoo, did the Vandals, having come from Africa with Genseric, their King,\r\nwho, not content with his booty and prey and all the cruelties that he\r\nwrought there, carried away her people into slavery, to their exceeding\r\ngreat misery, and among them Eudoxia, once the wife of the Emperor\r\nValentinian, who had been slaughtered no long time before by his own\r\nsoldiers. For these, having fallen away in very great measure from the\r\nancient Roman valour, for the reason that all the best had gone a long\r\ntime before to Byzantium with the Emperor Constantine, had no longer any\r\ngood customs or ways of life. Nay more, there had been lost at one and\r\nthe same time all true men and every sort of virtue, and laws, habits,\r\nnames, and tongues had been changed; and all these things together and\r\neach by itself had caused every lovely mind and lofty intellect to\r\nbecome most brutish and most base.\r\n\r\nBut what brought infinite harm and damage on the said professions, even\r\nmore than all the aforesaid causes, was the burning zeal of the new\r\nChristian religion, which, after a long and bloody combat, with its\r\nwealth of miracles and with the sincerity of its works, had finally cast\r\ndown and swept away the old faith of the heathens, and, devoting itself\r\nmost ardently with all diligence to driving out and extirpating root and\r\nbranch every least occasion whence error could arise, not only defaced\r\nor threw to the ground all the marvellous statues, sculptures, pictures,\r\nmosaics, and ornaments of the false gods of the heathens, but even the\r\nmemorials and the honours of numberless men of mark, to whom, for their\r\nexcellent merits, the noble spirit of the ancients had set up statues\r\nand other memorials in public places. Nay more, it not only destroyed,\r\nin order to build the churches for the Christian use, the most honoured\r\ntemples of the idols, but in order to ennoble and adorn S. Pietro (to\r\nsay nothing of the ornaments which had been there from the beginning) it\r\nalso robbed of its stone columns the Mausoleum of Hadrian, now called\r\nthe Castello di S. Angelo, and many other buildings that to-day we see\r\nin ruins. And although the Christian religion did not do this by reason\r\nof hatred that it bore to the arts, but only in order to humiliate and\r\ncast down the gods of the heathens, it was none the less true that from\r\nthis most ardent zeal there came so great ruin on these honoured\r\nprofessions that their very form was wholly lost. And as if aught were\r\nwanting to this grievous misfortune, there arose against Rome the wrath\r\nof Totila, who, besides razing her walls and destroying with fire and\r\nsword all her most wonderful and noble buildings, burnt the whole city\r\nfrom end to end, and, having robbed her of every living body, left her a\r\nprey to flames and fire, so that there was not found in her in eighteen\r\nsuccessive days a single living soul; and he cast down and destroyed so\r\ncompletely the marvellous statues, pictures, mosaics, and works in\r\nstucco, that there was lost, I do not say only their majesty, but their\r\nvery form and essence. Wherefore, it being the lower rooms chiefly of\r\nthe palaces and other buildings that were wrought with stucco, with\r\npainting, and with statuary, there was buried by the ruins from above\r\nall that good work that has been discovered in our own day, and those\r\nwho came after, judging the whole to be in ruins, planted vines thereon,\r\nin a manner that, since the said lower rooms remained under the ground,\r\nthe moderns have called them grottoes, and \"grotesque\" the pictures that\r\nare therein seen at the present day.\r\n\r\nAfter the end of the Ostrogoths, who were destroyed by Narses, men were\r\nliving among the ruins of Rome in some fashion, poorly indeed, when\r\nthere came, after 100 years, Constantine II, Emperor of Constantinople,\r\nwho, although received lovingly by the Romans, laid waste, robbed, and\r\ncarried away all that had remained, more by chance than by the good will\r\nof those who had destroyed her, in the miserable city of Rome. It is\r\ntrue, indeed, that he was not able to enjoy this booty, because, being\r\ncarried by a sea-tempest to Sicily and being justly slain by his own\r\nmen, he left his spoils, his kingdom, and his life a prey to Fortune.\r\nBut she, not yet content with the woes of Rome, to the end that the\r\nthings stolen might never return, brought thither for the ruin of the\r\nisland a host of Saracens, who carried off both the wealth of the\r\nSicilians and the spoils of Rome to Alexandria, to the very great shame\r\nand loss of Italy and of Christendom. And so all that the Pontiffs had\r\nnot destroyed (and above all S. Gregory, who is said to have decreed\r\nbanishment against all the remainder of the statues and of the spoils of\r\nthe buildings) came finally, at the hands of that most rascally Greek,\r\nto an evil end; in a manner that, there being no trace or sign to be\r\nfound of anything that was in any way good, the men who came after,\r\nalthough rude and boorish, and in particular in their pictures and\r\nsculptures, yet, incited by nature and refined by the air, set\r\nthemselves to work, not according to the rules of the aforesaid arts,\r\nwhich they did not know, but according to the quality of their own\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nThe arts of design, then, having been brought to these limits both\r\nbefore and during the lordship of the Lombards over Italy and also\r\nafterwards, continued gradually to grow worse, although some little work\r\nwas done, insomuch that nothing could have been more rudely wrought or\r\nwith less design than what was done, as bear witness, besides many other\r\nworks, certain figures that are in the portico of S. Pietro in Rome,\r\nabove the doors, wrought in the Greek manner in memory of certain holy\r\nfathers who had made disputation for Holy Church in certain councils. To\r\nthis, likewise, bear witness many works in the same manner that are to\r\nbe seen in the city and in the whole Exarchate of Ravenna, and in\r\nparticular some that are in S. Maria Rotonda without that city, made a\r\nlittle time after the Lombards had been driven out of Italy. In this\r\nchurch, as I will not forbear to say, there may be seen a thing most\r\nnotable and marvellous, namely, the vault, or rather cupola, that covers\r\nit, which, although it is ten braccia wide and serves for roof and\r\ncovering to that building, is nevertheless of one single piece, so great\r\nand ponderous that it seems almost impossible that such a stone,\r\nweighing more than 200,000 libbre,[4] could have been set into place so\r\nhigh. But to return to our subject; there issued from the hands of the\r\nmasters of these times those puppet-like and uncouth figures that are\r\nstill to be seen in the works of old. The same thing happened to\r\narchitecture, seeing that, since it was necessary to build, and since\r\nform and the good method were completely lost by reason of the death of\r\nthe craftsmen and the destruction and ruin of their works, those who\r\napplied themselves to this exercise built nothing that either in\r\nordering or in proportion showed any grace, or design, or reason\r\nwhatsoever. Wherefore there came to arise new architects, who brought\r\nfrom their barbarous races the method of that manner of buildings that\r\nare called by us to-day German; and they made some that are rather a\r\nsource of laughter for us moderns than creditable to them, until better\r\ncraftsmen afterwards found a better style, in some measure similar to\r\nthe good style of the ancients, even as that manner may be seen\r\nthroughout all Italy in the old churches (but not the ancient), which\r\nwere built by them, such as a palace of Theodoric, King of Italy, in\r\nRavenna, and one in Pavia, and another in Modena; all in a barbarous\r\nmanner, and rather rich and vast than well-conceived or of good\r\narchitecture. The same may be affirmed of S. Stefano in Rimini, of S.\r\nMartino in Ravenna, and of the Church of S. Giovanni Evangelista,\r\nerected in the same city by Galla Placidia about the year of our\r\nsalvation 438; of S. Vitale, which was erected in the year 547, of the\r\nAbbey of Classi di Fuori, and in short of many other monasteries and\r\nchurches erected after the Lombard rule. All these buildings, as has\r\nbeen said, are both large and magnificent, but of the rudest\r\narchitecture, and among them are many abbeys in France erected to S.\r\nBenedict, the Church and Monastery of Monte Casino, and the Church of S.\r\nGiovanni Battista at Monza, built by that Theodelinda, Queen of the\r\nGoths, to whom S. Gregory the Pope wrote his Dialogues; in which place\r\nthat Queen caused to be painted the story of the Lombards, wherein it\r\nwas seen that they shaved the back of their heads, and in front they had\r\nlong locks, and they dyed themselves as far as the chin. Their garments\r\nwere of ample linen, as was the use of the Angles and Saxons, and below\r\na mantle of diverse colours; their shoes open as far as the toes and\r\ntied above with certain straps of leather. Similar to the aforesaid\r\nchurches were the Church of S. Giovanni in Pavia, erected by Gondiberta,\r\ndaughter of the aforesaid Theodelinda, and in the same city the Church\r\nof S. Salvadore, built by the brother of the said Queen, Aribert, who\r\nsucceeded to the throne of Rodoald, husband of Gondiberta; and the\r\nChurch of S. Ambrogio in Pavia, erected by Grimoald, King of the\r\nLombards, who drove Bertrid, son of Aribert, from his throne. This\r\nBertrid, being restored to his throne after the death of Grimoald,\r\nerected, also in Pavia, a monastery for nuns called the Monasterio\r\nNuovo, in honour of Our Lady and of S. Agatha; and the Queen erected one\r\nwithout the walls, dedicated to the \"Virgin Mary in Pertica.\" Cunibert,\r\nlikewise, son of that Bertrid, erected a monastery and church after the\r\nsame manner to S. Giorgio, called di Coronate, on the spot where he had\r\ngained a great victory over Alahi. Not unlike to these, too, was the\r\nchurch that the King of the Lombards, Luitprand (who lived in the time\r\nof King Pepin, father of Charlemagne), built in Pavia, which is called\r\nS. Pietro in Cieldauro; nor that one, likewise, that Desiderius built,\r\nwho reigned after Astolf--namely, S. Pietro Clivate, in the diocese of\r\nMilan; nor the Monastery of S. Vincenzo in Milan, nor that of S. Giulia\r\nin Brescia, seeing that they were all built at the greatest cost, but in\r\nthe most ugly and haphazard manner.\r\n\r\nLater, in Florence, architecture made some little progress, and the\r\nChurch of S. Apostolo, that was erected by Charlemagne, although small,\r\nwas most beautiful in manner; for not to mention that the shafts of the\r\ncolumns, although they are of separate pieces, show much grace and are\r\nmade with beautiful proportion, the capitals, also, and the arches\r\nturned to make the little vaulted roofs of the two small aisles, show\r\nthat in Tuscany there had survived or in truth arisen some good\r\ncraftsman. In short, the architecture of this church is such that\r\nFilippo di Ser Brunellesco did not disdain to avail himself of it as a\r\nmodel in building the Church of S. Spirito and that of S. Lorenzo in the\r\nsame city. The same may be seen in the Church of S. Marco in Venice,\r\nwhich (to say nothing of S. Giorgio Maggiore, erected by Giovanni\r\nMorosini in the year 978) was begun under the Doge Giustiniano and\r\nGiovanni Particiaco, close by S. Teodosio, when the body of that\r\nEvangelist was sent from Alexandria to Venice; and after many fires,\r\nwhich greatly damaged the Doge's palace and the church, it was finally\r\nrebuilt on the same foundations in the Greek manner and in that style\r\nwherein it is seen to-day, at very great cost and under the direction of\r\nmany architects, in the year of Christ 973, at the time of Doge Domenico\r\nSelvo, who had the columns brought from wheresoever he could find them.\r\nAnd so it continued to go on up to the year 1140, when the Doge was\r\nMesser Piero Polani, and, as has been said, with the design of many\r\nmasters, all Greeks. In the same Greek manner and about the same time\r\nwere the seven abbeys that Count Ugo, Marquis of Brandenburg, caused to\r\nbe built in Tuscany, as can be seen in the Badia of Florence, in that of\r\nSettimo, and in the others; which buildings, with the remains of those\r\nthat are no longer standing, bear testimony that architecture was still\r\nin a measure holding its ground, although greatly corrupted and far\r\nremoved from the good manner of the ancients. To this can also bear\r\nwitness many old palaces built in Florence after the ruin of Fiesole, in\r\nTuscan workmanship, but with barbaric ordering in the proportions of\r\nthose doors and windows of immense length, in the curves of the pointed\r\nquarter-segments, and in the turning of the arches, after the wont of\r\nthe foreign architects of those times.\r\n\r\nThe year afterwards, 1013, it is clear that the art had regained some of\r\nits vigour from the rebuilding of that most beautiful church, S. Miniato\r\nin Sul Monte, in the time of Messer Alibrando, citizen and Bishop of\r\nFlorence; for the reason that, besides the marble ornaments that are\r\nseen therein both within and without, it may be seen from the facade\r\nthat the Tuscan architects strove as much as they could in the doors,\r\nthe windows, the columns, the arches, and the mouldings, to imitate the\r\ngood order of the ancients, having in part recovered it from the most\r\nancient temple of S. Giovanni in their city. At the same time painting,\r\nwhich was little less than wholly spent, may be seen to have begun to\r\nwin back something, as the mosaic shows that was made in the principal\r\nchapel[5] of the said Church of S. Miniato.\r\n\r\nFrom such beginnings, then, these arts commenced to grow better in\r\ndesign throughout Tuscany, as is seen in the year 1016, from the\r\ncommencement made by the people of Pisa for the building of their Duomo,\r\nseeing that in those times it was a great thing for men to put their\r\nhands to the construction of a church made, as this was, with five\r\nnaves, and almost wholly of marble both within and without. This church,\r\nwhich was built under the direction and design of Buschetto, a Greek of\r\nDulichium, an architect of rarest worth for those times, was erected and\r\nadorned by the people of Pisa with innumerable spoils brought by sea\r\n(for they were at the height of their greatness) from diverse most\r\ndistant places, as is well shown by the columns, bases, capitals,\r\ncornices, and all the other kinds of stonework that are therein seen.\r\nAnd seeing that these things were some of them small, some large, and\r\nsome of a middle size, great was the judgment and the talent of\r\nBuschetto in accommodating them and in making the distribution of all\r\nthis building, which is very well arranged both within and without; and\r\nbesides other work, he contrived the frontal slope of the facade very\r\ningeniously with a great number of columns, adorning it besides with\r\ncolumns carved in diverse and varied ways, and with ancient statues,\r\neven as he also made the principal doors in the same facade, between\r\nwhich--that is, beside that of the Carroccio--there was afterwards given\r\nan honourable burial-place to Buschetto himself, with three epitaphs,\r\nwhereof this is one, in Latin verses in no way dissimilar to others of\r\nthose times:\r\n\r\n      QUOD VIX MILLE BOUM POSSENT JUGA JUNCTA MOVERE,\r\n      ET QUOD VIX POTUIT PER MARE FERRE RATIS, BUSCHETTI NISU,\r\n      QUOD ERAT MIRABILE VISU,\r\n      DENA PUELLARUM TURBA LEVAVIT ONUS.\r\n\r\nAnd seeing that there has been made mention above of the Church of S.\r\nApostolo in Florence, I will not forbear to say that on a marble slab\r\ntherein, on one side of the high-altar, there may be seen these words:\r\n\r\n      VIII. V. DIE VI. APRILIS IN RESURRECTIONE DOMINI, KAROLUS\r\n     FRANCORUM REX A ROMA REVERTENS, INGRESSUS FLORENTIAM, CUM MAGNO\r\n     GAUDIO ET TRIPUDIO SUSCEPTUS, CIVIUM COPIAM TORQUEIS AUREIS\r\n     DECORAVIT ... ECCLESIA SANCTORUM APOSTOLORUM ... IN ALTARI INCLUSA\r\n     EST LAMINA PLUMBEA, IN QUA DESCRIPTA APPARET PRAEFATA FUNDATIO ET\r\n     CONSECRATIO FACTA PER ARCHIEPISCOPUM TURPINUM, TESTIBUS ROLANDO ET\r\n     ULIVERIO.\r\n\r\nThe aforesaid edifice of the Duomo in Pisa, awaking the minds of many to\r\nfair enterprises throughout all Italy, and above all in Tuscany, was the\r\ncause that in the city of Pistoia, in the year 1032, a beginning was\r\nmade for the Church of S. Paolo, in the presence of the Blessed Atto,\r\nBishop of that city, as may be read in a contract made at that time,\r\nand, in short, for many other buildings whereof it would take too long\r\nto make mention at present. I cannot forbear to say, however, following\r\nthe course of time, that afterwards, in the year 1060, there was erected\r\nin Pisa the round church of S. Giovanni, opposite the Duomo and in the\r\nsame square. And something marvellous and almost wholly incredible is to\r\nbe found recorded in an old book of the Works of the said Duomo, namely,\r\nthat the columns of the said S. Giovanni, the pillars, and the vaulting\r\nwere raised and completed in fifteen days and no more. In the same book,\r\nwhich anyone can see who has the wish, it may be read that for the\r\nbuilding of this church there was imposed a tax of one danaio for each\r\nfire, but it is not said therein whether of gold or of small coin; and\r\nat that time there were in Pisa, as may be seen in the same book, 34,000\r\nfires. Truly this work was vast, of great cost, and difficult to\r\nexecute, and above all the vaulting of the tribune, made in the shape of\r\na pear and covered without with lead. The outer side is full of columns,\r\ncarvings, and groups, and on the frieze of the central door is a Jesus\r\nChrist with the twelve Apostles in half-relief, after the Greek manner.\r\n\r\nThe people of Lucca, about the same time--that is, in the year 1061--as\r\nrivals of the people of Pisa, began the Church of S. Martino in Lucca\r\nfrom the design of certain disciples of Buschetto, there being then no\r\nother architects in Tuscany. Attached to the facade of this church there\r\nmay be seen a marble portico with many ornaments and carvings made in\r\nmemory of Pope Alexander II, who had been, a short time before he was\r\nelected to the Pontificate, Bishop of that city. Of this construction\r\nand of Alexander himself everything is fully told in nine Latin verses,\r\nand the same may be seen in certain other ancient letters engraved on\r\nthe marble under the portico, between the doors. On the said facade are\r\ncertain figures, and under the portico many scenes in marble from the\r\nlife of S. Martin, in half-relief, and in the Greek manner. But the\r\nbest, which are over one of the doors, were made 170 years after by\r\nNiccola Pisano and finished in 1233, as will be told in the proper\r\nplace; the Wardens, when these were begun, being Abellenato and\r\nAliprando, as it may be clearly seen from certain letters carved in\r\nmarble in the same place. These figures by the hand of Niccola Pisano\r\nshow how much improvement there came from him to the art of sculpture.\r\nSimilar to these were most, nay, all of the buildings that were erected\r\nin Italy from the times aforesaid up to the year 1250, seeing that\r\nlittle or no acquisition or improvement can be seen to have been made in\r\nthe space of so many years by architecture, which stayed within the same\r\nlimits and went on ever in that rude manner, whereof many examples are\r\nstill to be seen, of which I will at present make no mention, for the\r\nreason that they will be spoken of below according to the occasions that\r\nmay come before me.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the good sculptures and pictures which had been buried\r\nunder the ruins of Italy remained up to the same time hidden from or not\r\nknown to the men boorishly reared in the rudeness of the modern use of\r\nthat age, wherein no other sculptures or pictures existed than those\r\nwhich a remnant of old Greeks were making either in images of clay or\r\nstone, or painting monstrous figures and covering only the bare\r\nlineaments with colour. These craftsmen, as the best, being the only\r\nones in these professions, were summoned to Italy, whither they brought\r\nsculpture and painting, together with mosaic, in that style wherein\r\nthey knew them; and even so they taught them rudely and roughly to the\r\nItalians, who afterwards made use of them, as has been told and will be\r\ntold further, up to a certain time. And the men of those times, not\r\nbeing used to see other excellence or greater perfection in any work\r\nthan that which they themselves saw, marvelled and took these for the\r\nbest, for all that they were vile, until the spirits of the generation\r\nthen arising, helped in some places by the subtlety of the air, became\r\nso greatly purged that about 1250, Heaven, moved to pity for the lovely\r\nminds that the Tuscan soil was producing every day, restored them to\r\ntheir first condition. And although those before them had seen remains\r\nof arches, of colossi, of statues, of urns, and of storied columns in\r\nthe ages that came after the sackings, the destructions, and the\r\nburnings of Rome, and never knew how to make use of them or draw from\r\nthem any benefit, up to the time mentioned above, the minds that came\r\nafter, discerning well enough the good from the bad and abandoning the\r\nold manners, turned to imitating the ancient with all their industry and\r\nwit.\r\n\r\nBut in order that it may be understood more clearly what I call \"old\"\r\nand what \"ancient,\" the \"ancient\" were the works made before Constantine\r\nin Corinth, in Athens, in Rome, and in other very famous cities, until\r\nthe time of Nero, the Vespasians, Trajan, Hadrian, and Antoninus;\r\nwhereas those others are called \"old\" that were executed from S.\r\nSilvester's day up to that time by a certain remnant of Greeks, who knew\r\nrather how to dye than how to paint. For since the excellent early\r\ncraftsmen had been killed in these wars, as has been said, to the\r\nremainder of these Greeks, old but not ancient, there had been left\r\nnothing but elementary outlines on a ground of colour; and to this at\r\nthe present day witness is borne by an infinity of mosaics, which,\r\nwrought throughout all Italy by these Greeks, are to be seen in every\r\nold church in any city whatsoever of Italy, and above all in the Duomo\r\nof Pisa, in S. Marco at Venice, and in other places as well; and so,\r\ntoo, they kept making many pictures in that manner, with eyes staring,\r\nhands outstretched, and standing on tiptoe, as may still be seen in S.\r\nMiniato without Florence, between the door that leads into the sacristy\r\nand that which leads into the convent; and in S. Spirito in the said\r\ncity, the whole side of the cloister opposite the church; and in like\r\nmanner at Arezzo, in S. Giuliano and S. Bartolommeo and in other\r\nchurches; and in Rome, in the old Church of S. Pietro, scenes right\r\nround between the windows--works that have more of the monstrous in\r\ntheir lineaments than of likeness to whatsoever they represent. Of\r\nsculptures, likewise, they made an infinity, as may still be seen in\r\nlow-relief over the door of S. Michele in the Piazza Padella of\r\nFlorence, and in Ognissanti; and tombs and adornments in many places for\r\nthe doors of churches, wherein they have certain figures for corbels to\r\nsupport the roof, so rude and vile, so misshapen, and of such a\r\ngrossness of manner, that it appears impossible that worse could be\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\nThus far have I thought fit to discourse from the beginning of sculpture\r\nand of painting, and peradventure at greater length than was necessary\r\nin this place, which I have done, indeed, not so much carried away by my\r\naffection for art as urged by the common benefit and advantage of our\r\ncraftsmen. For having seen in what way she, from a small beginning,\r\nclimbed to the greatest height, and how from a state so noble she fell\r\ninto utter ruin, and that, in consequence, the nature of this art is\r\nsimilar to that of the others, which, like human bodies, have their\r\nbirth, their growth, their growing old, and their death; they will now\r\nbe able to recognize more easily the progress of her second birth and of\r\nthat very perfection whereto she has risen again in our times. And I\r\nhope, moreover, that if ever (which God forbid) it should happen at any\r\ntime, through the negligence of men, or through the malice of time, or,\r\nfinally, through the decree of Heaven, which appears to be unwilling\r\nthat the things of this earth should exist for long in one form, that\r\nshe falls again into the same chaos of ruin; that these my labours,\r\nwhatsoever they may be worth (if indeed they may be worthy of a happier\r\nfortune), both through what has been already said and through what\r\nremains to say, may be able to keep her alive or at least to encourage\r\nthe most exalted minds to provide them with better assistance; so much\r\nso that, what with my good will and the works of these masters, she may\r\nabound in those aids and adornments wherein, if I may freely speak the\r\ntruth, she has been wanting up to the present day.\r\n\r\nBut it is now time to come to the Life of Giovanni Cimabue, and even as\r\nhe gave the first beginning to the new method of drawing and painting,\r\nso it is just and expedient that he should give it to the Lives, in\r\nwhich I will do my utmost to observe, the most that I can, the order of\r\ntheir manners rather than that of time. And in describing the forms and\r\nfeatures of the craftsmen I will be brief, seeing that their portraits,\r\nwhich have been collected by me with no less cost and fatigue than\r\ndiligence, will show better what sort of men the craftsmen themselves\r\nwere in appearance than describing them could ever do; and if the\r\nportrait of any one of them should be wanting, that is not through my\r\nfault but by reason of its being nowhere found. And if the said\r\nportraits were not peradventure to appear to someone to be absolutely\r\nlike to others that might be found, I wish it to be remembered that the\r\nportrait made of a man when he was eighteen or twenty years old will\r\nnever be like to the portrait that may have been made fifteen or twenty\r\nyears later. To this it must be added that portraits in drawing are\r\nnever so like as are those in colours, not to mention that the\r\nengravers, who have no draughtsmanship, always rob the faces (being\r\nunable or not knowing how to make exactly those minutenesses that make\r\nthem good and true to life) of that perfection which is rarely or never\r\nfound in portraits cut in wood. In short, how great have been therein my\r\nlabour, expense, and diligence, will be evident to those who, in\r\nreading, will see whence I have to the best of my ability unearthed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The libbra is twelve ounces of our ordinary pound\r\n(avoirdupois).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: It is difficult to find a rendering of \"cappella maggiore\"\r\nthat is absolutely satisfactory.

WRITTEN BY MESSER GIORGIO\r\nVASARI, PAINTER OF AREZZO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI CIMABUE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nMADONNA, CHILD AND ANGELS\r\n\r\n(_After the painting by_ Cimabue. _Paris: Louvre, 1260_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF GIOVANNI CIMABUE,\r\n\r\nPAINTER OF FLORENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the infinite flood of evils which had laid prostrate and submerged\r\npoor Italy there had not only been ruined everything that could truly\r\nclaim the name of building, but there had been blotted out (and this was\r\nof graver import) the whole body of the craftsmen, when, by the will of\r\nGod, in the city of Florence, in the year 1240, there was born, to give\r\nthe first light to the art of painting, Giovanni, surnamed Cimabue, of\r\nthe family, noble in those times, of Cimabue. He, while growing up,\r\nbeing judged by his father and by others to have a beautiful and acute\r\nintelligence, was sent, to the end that he might exercise himself in\r\nletters, to a master in S. Maria Novella, his relative, who was then\r\nteaching grammar to the novices of that convent; but Cimabue, in place\r\nof attending to his letters, would spend the whole day, as one who felt\r\nhimself led thereto by nature, in drawing, on books and other papers,\r\nmen, horses, houses, and diverse other things of fancy; to which natural\r\ninclination fortune was favourable, for certain Greek painters had been\r\nsummoned to Florence by those who then governed the city, for nothing\r\nelse but to restore to Florence the art of painting, which was rather\r\nout of mind than out of fashion, and they began, among the other works\r\nundertaken in the city, the Chapel of the Gondi, whereof to-day the\r\nvaulting and the walls are little less than eaten away by time, as may\r\nbe seen in S. Maria Novella beside the principal chapel, where it\r\nstands. Wherefore Cimabue, having begun to take his first steps in this\r\nart which pleased him, playing truant often from school, would stand the\r\nlivelong day watching these masters at work, in a manner that, being\r\njudged by his father and by these painters to be in such wise fitted\r\nfor painting that there could be hoped for him, applying himself to this\r\nprofession, an honourable success, to his own no small satisfaction he\r\nwas apprenticed by the said father to these men; whereupon, exercising\r\nhimself without ceasing, in a short time nature assisted him so greatly\r\nthat he surpassed by a long way, both in drawing and in colouring, the\r\nmanner of the masters who were teaching him. For they, giving no thought\r\nto making any advance, had made those works in that fashion wherein they\r\nare seen to-day--that is, not in the good ancient manner of the Greeks\r\nbut in that rude modern manner of those times; and because, although he\r\nimitated these Greeks, he added much perfection to the art, relieving it\r\nof a great part of their rude manner, he gave honour to his country with\r\nhis name and with the works that he made, to which witness is borne in\r\nFlorence by the pictures that he wrought, such as the front of the altar\r\nin S. Cecilia, and in S. Croce a panel with a Madonna, which was and\r\nstill is placed against a pilaster on the right within the choir. After\r\nthis, he made a S. Francis on a small panel on a gold ground, and\r\nportrayed him from nature (which was something new in those times) as\r\nbest he knew, and round him all the stories of his life, in twenty small\r\npictures full of little figures on a gold ground.\r\n\r\nHaving next undertaken to make a large panel for the monks of\r\nVallombrosa, in the Abbey of S. Trinita in Florence, he showed in that\r\nwork (using therein great diligence, so as to rise equal to the esteem\r\nwhich had already been conceived of him) better inventions and a\r\nbeautiful method in the attitude of a Madonna, whom he made with the\r\nChild in her arms and with many angels round her in adoration, on a gold\r\nground; which panel, being finished, was placed by these monks over the\r\nhigh-altar of the said church, and being afterwards removed, in order to\r\ngive that place to the panel by Alesso Baldovinetti which is there\r\nto-day, it was placed in a smaller chapel in the left-hand aisle of the\r\nsaid church.\r\n\r\nWorking next in fresco on the Hospital of the Porcellana, at the corner\r\nof the Via Nuova which goes into the Borg' Ognissanti, on the facade\r\nwhich has in the middle the principal door, and making on one side the\r\nAnnunciation of the Virgin by the Angel, and on the other Jesus Christ\r\nwith Cleophas and Luke, figures as large as life, he swept away that\r\nancient manner, making the draperies, the vestments, and everything else\r\nin this work, a little more lively and more natural and softer than the\r\nmanner of these Greeks, all full of lines and profiles both in mosaic\r\nand in painting; which manner, rough, rude, and vulgar, the painters of\r\nthose times, not by means of study, but by a certain convention, had\r\ntaught one to the other for many and many a year, without ever thinking\r\nof bettering their draughtsmanship, of beauty of colouring, or of any\r\ninvention that might be good.\r\n\r\nCimabue, being summoned again after this work by the same Prior who had\r\ncaused him to make the works in S. Croce, made him a large Crucifix on\r\nwood, which is still seen to-day in the church; which work was the\r\nreason, it appearing to the Prior that he had been well served, that he\r\ntook him to S. Francesco in Pisa, their convent, in order to make a S.\r\nFrancis on a panel, which was held by these people to be a most rare\r\nwork, there being seen therein a certain greater quality of excellence,\r\nboth in the air of the heads and in the folds of the draperies, than had\r\nbeen shown in the Greek manner up to that time by anyone who had wrought\r\nanything, not only in Pisa, but in all Italy. Cimabue having next made\r\nfor the same church on a large panel the image of Our Lady, with the\r\nChild in her arms and with many angels round her, also on a ground of\r\ngold, it was after no long time removed from where it had been set up\r\nthe first time, in order to make there the marble altar that is there at\r\npresent, and was placed within the church beside the door on the left\r\nhand; and for this work he was much praised and rewarded by the people\r\nof Pisa. In the same city of Pisa, at the request of the then Abbot of\r\nS. Paolo in Ripa d'Arno, he made a S. Agnes on a little panel, and round\r\nher, with little figures, all the stories of her life; which little\r\npanel is to-day over the altar of the Virgins in the said church.\r\n\r\nBy reason of these works, then, the name of Cimabue being very famous\r\neverywhere, he was brought to Assisi, a city of Umbria, where, in\r\ncompany with certain Greek masters, in the lower Church of S.\r\nFrancesco, he painted part of the vaulting, and on the walls the life of\r\nJesus Christ and that of S. Francis. In these pictures he surpassed by a\r\nlong way those Greek painters; wherefore, growing in courage, he began\r\nby his own self to paint the upper church in fresco, and in the chief\r\napse, over the choir, on four sides, he made certain stories of Our\r\nLady--namely, her death; when her soul is borne by Christ to Heaven upon\r\na throne of clouds; and when, in the midst of a choir of angels, He\r\ncrowns her, with a great number of saints below, both male and female,\r\nnow eaten away by time and by dust. Next, in the sections of the\r\nvaulting of the said church, which are five, he painted in like manner\r\nmany scenes. In the first, over the choir, he made the four Evangelists,\r\nlarger than life, and so well that to-day there is still recognized in\r\nthem much that is good, and the freshness of the colours in the flesh\r\nshows that painting began to make great progress in fresco work through\r\nthe labours of Cimabue. The second section he made full of golden stars\r\non a ground of ultramarine. In the third he made in certain medallions\r\nJesus Christ, the Virgin His mother, S. John the Baptist, and S.\r\nFrancis--namely, in every medallion one of these figures, and in every\r\nquarter segment of the vaulting a medallion. And between this and the\r\nfifth section he painted the fourth with golden stars, as above, on a\r\nground of ultramarine. In the fifth he painted the four Doctors of the\r\nChurch, and beside each one of these one of the four chief Religious\r\nOrders--a work truly laborious and executed with infinite diligence. The\r\nvaulting finished, he wrought, also in fresco, the upper walls of the\r\nwhole left-hand side of the church, making towards the high-altar,\r\nbetween the windows and right up to the vaulting, eight scenes from the\r\nOld Testament, commencing from the beginning of Genesis and following\r\nthe most notable events. And in the space that is round the windows, up\r\nto the point where they end in the gallery that encircles the interior\r\nof the wall of the church, he painted the remainder of the Old Testament\r\nin eight other scenes. And opposite this work, in sixteen other scenes\r\ncorresponding to these, he painted the acts of Our Lady and of Jesus\r\nChrist. And on the end wall over the principal door, and round the rose\r\nwindow of the church, he made her Ascension into Heaven and the Holy\r\nSpirit descending on the Apostles. This work, truly very great and\r\nrich and most excellently executed, must have, in my judgment, amazed\r\nthe world in those times, seeing, above all, that painting had lain so\r\nlong in such great darkness; and to me, who saw it again in the year\r\n1563, it appeared very beautiful, thinking how in so great darkness\r\nCimabue could see so great light. But of all these pictures (and to this\r\nwe should give consideration), those on the roof, as being less injured\r\nby dust and by other accidents, have been preserved much better than the\r\nothers. These works finished, Giovanni put his hand to painting the\r\nlower walls--namely, those that are from the windows downwards--and made\r\ncertain works upon them, but being called to Florence on some business\r\nof his own, he did not carry this work further; but it was finished, as\r\nwill be told in the proper place, by Giotto, many years afterwards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anderson_\r\n\r\n\"ISAAC'S BLESSING\"\r\n\r\n(_After the fresco of the_ Roman School. _Assisi: Upper Church of S.\r\nFrancesco_)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anderson_\r\n\r\nTHE DEPOSITION FROM THE CROSS\r\n\r\n(_After the fresco by_ Pietro Laurati [Lorenzetti]. _Assisi: Lower\r\nChurch of S. Francesco_)]\r\n\r\nHaving returned, then, to Florence, Cimabue painted in the cloister of\r\nS. Spirito (wherein there is painted in the Greek manner, by other\r\nmasters, the whole side facing the church) three small arches by his own\r\nhand, from the life of Christ, and truly with much design. And at the\r\nsame time he sent certain works wrought by himself in Florence to\r\nEmpoli, which works are still held to-day in great veneration in the\r\nPieve of that township. Next, he made for the Church of S. Maria Novella\r\nthe panel of Our Lady that is set on high between the Chapel of the\r\nRucellai and that of the Bardi da Vernia; which work was of greater size\r\nthan any figure that had been made up to that time. And certain angels\r\nthat are round it show that, although he still had the Greek manner, he\r\nwas going on approaching in part to the line and method of the modern.\r\nWherefore this work caused so great marvel to the people of that age, by\r\nreason of there not having been seen up to then anything better, that it\r\nwas borne in most solemn procession from the house of Cimabue to the\r\nchurch, with much rejoicing and with trumpets, and he was thereby much\r\nrewarded and honoured. It is said, and it may be read in certain records\r\nof old painters, that while Cimabue was painting the said panel in\r\ncertain gardens close to the Porta S. Pietro, there passed through\r\nFlorence King Charles the Elder of Anjou, and that, among the many signs\r\nof welcome made to him by the men of this city, they brought him to see\r\nCimabue's panel; whereupon, for the reason that it had not yet been seen\r\nby anyone, in the showing it to the King there flocked together to it\r\nall the men and all the women of Florence, with the utmost rejoicing and\r\nin the greatest crowd in the world. Wherefore, by reason of the joy that\r\nthe neighbours had thereby, they called that place the Borgo Allegri;\r\nwhich place, although enclosed in time within the walls, has ever after\r\nretained the same name.\r\n\r\nIn S. Francesco in Pisa, where he wrought, as has been said above,\r\ncertain other works, there is in the cloister, beside the door that\r\nleads into the church, in a corner, a small panel in distemper by the\r\nhand of Cimabue, wherein is a Christ on the Cross, with certain angels\r\nround Him, who, weeping, are taking with their hands certain words that\r\nare written round the head of Christ and are presenting them to the ears\r\nof a Madonna who stands weeping on the right, and on the other side to\r\nS. John the Evangelist, who is on the left, all grieving. And the words\r\nto the Virgin are: MULIER, ECCE FILIUS TUUS; and those to S. John: ECCE\r\nMATER TUA; and those that an angel standing apart holds in his hand,\r\nsay: EX ILLA HORA ACCEPIT EAM DISCIPULUS IN SUAM. Wherein it is to be\r\nobserved that Cimabue began to give light and to open the way to\r\ninvention, assisting art with words in order to express his conception;\r\nwhich was certainly something whimsical and new.\r\n\r\nNow because, by means of these works, Cimabue had acquired a very great\r\nname, together with much profit, he was appointed as architect, in\r\ncompany with Arnolfo Lapi, a man then excellent in architecture, for the\r\nbuilding of S. Maria del Fiore in Florence. But at length, having lived\r\nsixty years, he passed to the other life in the year 1300, having little\r\nless than resurrected painting. He left many disciples, and among others\r\nGiotto, who was afterwards an excellent painter; which Giotto dwelt,\r\nafter Cimabue, in his master's own house in the Via del Cocomero.\r\nCimabue was buried in S. Maria del Fiore, with that epitaph made for him\r\nby one of the Nini:\r\n\r\n     CREDIDIT UT CIMABOS PICTURAE CASTRA TENERE,\r\n     SIC TENUIT, VIVENS: NUNC TENET ASTRA POLI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anderson_\r\n\r\nTHE CRUCIFIXION\r\n\r\n(_After the fresco by_ Cimabue. _Assisi: Upper Church of S.\r\nFrancesco_)]\r\n\r\nI will not refrain from saying that if to the glory of Cimabue there had\r\nnot been contrasted the greatness of Giotto, his disciple, his fame\r\nwould have been greater, as Dante demonstrates in his _Commedia_,\r\nwherein, alluding in the eleventh canto of the _Purgatorio_ to this very\r\ninscription on the tomb, he said:\r\n\r\n     Credette Cimabue nella pittura\r\n     Tener lo campo, ed hora ha Giotto il grido,\r\n     Si che la fama di colui s' oscura.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of these verses, a commentator of Dante, who wrote at the\r\ntime when Giotto was alive and ten or twelve years after the death of\r\nDante himself--that is, about the year of Christ 1334--says, speaking of\r\nCimabue, precisely these words: \"Cimabue was a painter of Florence in\r\nthe time of the author, very noble beyond the knowledge of man, and\r\nwithal so arrogant and so disdainful that if there were found by anyone\r\nany failing or defect in his work, or if he himself had seen one (even\r\nas it comes to pass many times that the craftsman errs, through a defect\r\nin the material whereon he works, or through some lack in the instrument\r\nwherewith he labours), incontinently he would destroy that work, however\r\ncostly it might be. Giotto was and is the most exalted among the\r\npainters of the same city of Florence, and his works bear testimony for\r\nhim in Rome, in Naples, in Avignon, in Florence, in Padua, and in many\r\nparts of the world.\" This commentary is now in the hands of the Very\r\nReverend Don Vincenzio Borghini, Prior of the Innocenti, a man not only\r\nmost famous for his nobility, goodness, and learning, but also endowed\r\nwith such love and understanding for all the finer arts that he has\r\ndeserved to be elected by the Lord Duke Cosimo, most properly, as his\r\nLieutenant in our Academy of Design.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Cimabue: Giotto, truly, obscured his fame not otherwise\r\nthan as a great light does the splendour of one much less, for the\r\nreason that although Cimabue was, as it were, the first cause of the\r\nrenovation of the art of painting, yet Giotto, his pupil, moved by\r\nlaudable ambition and assisted by Heaven and by nature, was he who,\r\nrising higher with his thought, opened the gate of truth to those who\r\nhave brought her to that perfection and majesty wherein we see her in\r\nher own century, which, being used to see every day the marvels, the\r\nmiracles, nay, the impossibilities wrought by the craftsmen in that art,\r\nis now brought to such a pitch that nothing that men do, be it even more\r\nDivine than human, causes it in any way to marvel. Well is it with those\r\nwhose labours deserve all praise, if, in place of being praised and\r\nadmired, they do not thereby incur blame and many times even disgrace.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Cimabue, by the hand of Simone Sanese, is to be seen in\r\nthe Chapter-house of S. Maria Novella, made in profile in the story of\r\nthe Faith, in a figure that has the face thin, the beard small, reddish,\r\nand pointed, with a cap according to the use of those times--that is,\r\nwound round and round and under the throat in lovely fashion. He who is\r\nbeside him is Simone himself, the author of that work, who portrayed\r\nhimself with two mirrors in order to make his head in profile, placing\r\nthe one opposite to the other. And that soldier clad in armour who is\r\nbetween them is said to be Count Guido Novello, then Lord of Poppi.\r\nThere remains for me to say of Cimabue that in the beginning of our\r\nbook, where I have put together drawings from the own hand of all those\r\nwho have made drawings from his time to ours, there are to be seen\r\ncertain small things made by his hand in the way of miniature, wherein,\r\nalthough to-day perchance they appear rather rude than otherwise, it is\r\nseen how much excellence was given by his work to draughtsmanship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CIMABUE: MADONNA AND CHILD\r\n\r\n(_Florence: Accademia 102 Panel_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARNOLFO DI LAPO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF ARNOLFO DI LAPO,\r\n\r\nARCHITECT OF FLORENCE\r\n\r\n\r\n     [NOTICE TO READERS IN THE LIFE OF ARNOLFO.--The said Arnolfo began,\r\n     in S. Maria Maggiore in Rome, the tomb of Pope Honorius III, of the\r\n     house of Savelli; which tomb he left imperfect, with the portrait\r\n     of the said Pope, which was afterwards placed with his design in\r\n     the principal chapel of mosaic of S. Paolo in Rome, with the\r\n     portrait of Giovanni Gaetano, Abbot of that monastery. And the\r\n     marble chapel, wherein is the Manger of Jesus Christ, was one of\r\n     the last pieces of sculpture in marble that Arnolfo ever made; and\r\n     he made it at the instance of Pandolfo Ippotecorvo, in the year\r\n     twelve (?), as an epitaph bears witness that is on the wall beside\r\n     the chapel; and likewise the chapel and tomb of Pope Boniface VIII,\r\n     in S. Pietro in Rome, whereon is carved the same name of Arnolfo,\r\n     who wrought it.]\r\n\r\nHaving discoursed, in the Preface to the Lives, of certain buildings in\r\na manner old but not ancient, and having been silent, for the reason\r\nthat I did not know them, about the names of the architects who had\r\ncharge of their construction, I will make mention, in the Preface to\r\nthis Life of Arnolfo, of certain other edifices built in his time or a\r\nlittle before, whereof in like manner it is not known who were the\r\nmasters; and then of those that were built in the same times, whereof it\r\nis known who were the architects, either because the manner of the\r\nedifices themselves is recognized very well, or because we have had\r\ninformation about them by means of the writings and memorials left by\r\nthem in the works that they made. Nor will this be outside our subject,\r\nseeing that, although they are neither in a beautiful nor in a good\r\nmanner but only vast and magnificent, they are worthy none the less of\r\nsome consideration.\r\n\r\nThere were built, then, in the time of Lapo and of Arnolfo his son, many\r\nedifices of importance both in Italy and abroad, whereof I have not been\r\nable to find the architects, such as the Abbey of Monreale in Sicily,\r\nthe Piscopio of Naples, the Certosa of Pavia, the Duomo of Milan, S.\r\nPietro and S. Petronio in Bologna, and many others which are seen\r\nthroughout all Italy, built at incredible cost. Having seen all these\r\nbuildings for myself and studied them, and likewise many sculptures of\r\nthose times, particularly in Ravenna, and not having ever found, I do\r\nnot say any memorials of the masters, but even many times the date when\r\nthey were built, I cannot but marvel at the rudeness and little desire\r\nfor glory of the men of that age. But returning to our subject; after\r\nthe buildings named above, there began at last to arise men of a more\r\nexalted spirit, who, if they did not find, sought at least to find\r\nsomething of the good. The first was Buono, of whom I know neither the\r\ncountry nor the surname, for the reason that in making record of himself\r\nin some of his works he put nothing but simply his name. He, being both\r\nsculptor and architect, first made many palaces and churches and some\r\nsculptures in Ravenna, in the year of our salvation 1152; and having\r\nbecome known by reason of these works, he was called to Naples, where he\r\nfounded (although they were finished by others, as will be told) the\r\nCastel Capoano and the Castel dell' Uovo; and afterwards, in the time of\r\nDomenico Morosini, Doge of Venice, he founded the Campanile of S. Marco\r\nwith much consideration and judgment, having caused the foundation of\r\nthat tower to be so well fixed with piles that it has never moved a\r\nhair's-breadth, as many buildings constructed in that city before his\r\nday have been seen and still are seen to have done. And from him,\r\nperchance, the Venetians learnt to found, in the manner in which they do\r\nit to-day, the very beautiful and very rich edifices that every day are\r\nbeing built so magnificently in that most noble city. It is true,\r\nindeed, that this tower has nothing else good in it, neither manner, nor\r\nornament, nor, in short, anything that might be worthy of much praise.\r\nIt was finished under Anastasius IV and Adrian IV, Pontiffs, in the year\r\n1154. In architecture, likewise, Buono made the Church of S. Andrea in\r\nPistoia, and in sculpture he made an architrave of marble that is over\r\nthe door, full of figures made in the manner of the Goths, on which\r\narchitrave his name is carved, with the date when this work was made by\r\nhim, which was the year 1166. Next, being summoned to Florence, he gave\r\nthe design for enlarging, as was done, the Church of S. Maria Maggiore,\r\nwhich was then without the city, and held in great veneration for the\r\nreason that Pope Pelagius had consecrated it many years before, and\r\nbecause, as to size and manner, it was a very fair body of a church.\r\n\r\nBeing then summoned by the Aretines to their city, Buono built the old\r\nhabitation of the Lords of Arezzo, namely, a palace in the manner of the\r\nGoths, and beside it a bell-tower. This edifice, which for that manner\r\nwas good enough, was thrown to the ground, because it was opposite and\r\nvery near to the fortress of that city, in the year 1533. Afterwards,\r\nthe art making some little improvement through the works of one\r\nGuglielmo, German (I believe) in origin, there were built certain\r\nedifices of the greatest cost and in a slightly better manner; for this\r\nGuglielmo, so it is said, in the year 1174, together with Bonanno, a\r\nsculptor, founded in Pisa the Campanile of the Duomo, where there are\r\ncertain words carved that say: A.D. MCLXXIV, CAMPANILE HOC FUIT\r\nFUNDATUM, MENSE AUG. But these two architects not having much practice\r\nof founding in Pisa and therefore not supporting the platform with\r\npiles, as they ought, before they had gone halfway with that building it\r\ninclined to one side and bent over to the weakest part, in a manner that\r\nthe said campanile leans six and a half braccia[6] out of the straight,\r\naccording as the foundation sank on this side; and although in the lower\r\npart this is not much, up above it shows clear enough to make men stand\r\nfast in a marvel how it can be that it has not fallen down and has not\r\nthrown out cracks. The reason is that this edifice is round both without\r\nand within and built in the shape of a hollow well, and bound together\r\nwith the stones in a manner that it is well-nigh impossible that it\r\nshould fall; and it is assisted, above all, by the foundations, which\r\nhave an outwork three braccia wide outside the tower, made, as it is\r\nseen, after the sinking of the campanile, in order to support it. I am\r\nconvinced that if it had been square it would not have been standing\r\nto-day, for the reason that the corner-stones of the square sides, as is\r\noften seen to happen, would have forced them out in a manner that it\r\nwould have fallen down. And if the Garisenda, a tower in Bologna,\r\nalthough square, leans and does not fall, that comes to pass because it\r\nis slender and does not lean so much, not being burdened by so great a\r\nweight, by a great measure, as is this campanile, which is praised, not\r\nbecause it has in it any design or beautiful manner, but simply for its\r\nextravagance, it appearing impossible to anyone who sees it that it can\r\nin any wise keep standing. And the same Bonanno, while the said\r\ncampanile was building, made, in the year 1180, the royal door of bronze\r\nfor the said Duomo of Pisa, wherein are seen these letters:\r\n\r\n     EGO BONANNUS PIS. MEA ARTE HANC PORTAM UNO ANNO PERFECI,\r\n                     TEMPORE BENEDICTI OPERARII.\r\n\r\nNext, from the walls that were made from ancient spoils at S. Giovanni\r\nLaterano in Rome, under Lucius III and Urban III, Pontiffs, when the\r\nEmperor Frederick was crowned by this Urban, it is seen that the art was\r\ngoing on continually improving, because certain little temples and\r\nchapels, built, as has been said, of spoils, have passing good design\r\nand certain things in them worthy of consideration, and among others\r\nthis, that in order not to overburden the walls of these buildings the\r\nvaulting was made of small tubes and with partitions of stucco,\r\npraiseworthy enough for these times. And from the mouldings and other\r\nparts it is seen that the craftsmen were going on striving in order to\r\nfind the good way.\r\n\r\nInnocent III afterwards caused two palaces to be built on the Vatican\r\nHill, which were passing good, in so far as it has been possible to\r\ndiscover; but since they were destroyed by other Popes, and in\r\nparticular by Nicholas V, who pulled down and rebuilt the greater part\r\nof one palace, there will be nothing said of them but this, that a part\r\nof them is to be seen in the great Round Tower and part in the old\r\nsacristy of S. Pietro. This Innocent III, who ruled for nineteen years\r\nand took much delight in building, made many edifices in Rome; and in\r\nparticular, with the design of Marchionne Aretino, both architect and\r\nsculptor, the Conti Tower, so called from his own surname, seeing that\r\nhe was of that family. The same Marchionne, in the year when Innocent\r\nIII died, finished the building of the Pieve of Arezzo and likewise the\r\ncampanile, making in sculpture, for the facade of the said church, three\r\nrows of columns one above the other, with great variety not only in the\r\nfashion of the capitals and the bases but also in the shafts of the\r\ncolumns, some among them being thick, some slender, some joined together\r\ntwo by two, and others four by four. In like manner there are some\r\ntwined in the manner of vines, and some made in the shape of figures\r\nacting as supports, with diverse carvings. He also made therein many\r\nanimals of diverse sorts that support on the middle of their backs the\r\nweights of those columns, and all with the most strange and extravagant\r\ninventions that can possibly be imagined, and not only wide of the good\r\norder of the ancients but almost wide of all just and reasonable\r\nproportion. But with all this, whosoever sets out well to consider the\r\nwhole sees that he went on striving to do well, and thought peradventure\r\nto have found it in that method of working and in that whimsical\r\nvariety. The same man made in sculpture, on the arch that is over the\r\ndoor of the said church, in barbaric manner, a God the Father with\r\ncertain angels, in half-relief and rather large; and in the arch he\r\ncarved the twelve months, placing his own name underneath in round\r\nletters, as was the custom, and the date--namely, the year 1216. It is\r\nsaid that Marchionne built in the Borgo Vecchio in Rome, for the same\r\nPope Innocent III, the ancient edifice of the Hospital and Church of S.\r\nSpirito in Sassia, where there is still seen something of the old; and\r\nthe ancient church was still standing in our own day, when it was\r\nrebuilt in modern fashion, with greater ornament and design, by Pope\r\nPaul III of the house of Farnese.\r\n\r\nAnd in S. Maria Maggiore, also in Rome, he built the marble chapel where\r\nthere is the Manger of Jesus Christ; here he portrayed from the life\r\nPope Honorius III, whose tomb, also, he made, with ornaments some little\r\nbetter than and different enough from the manner that was then in\r\nuniversal use throughout all Italy. About the same time Marchionne also\r\nmade the side door of S. Pietro in Bologna, which was truly for those\r\ntimes a work of the greatest mastery, by reason of the many carvings\r\nthat are seen therein, such as lions in the round that sustain columns,\r\nand men in the use of porters, and other animals that support weights;\r\nand in the arch above he made the twelve months in full relief, with\r\nvarious fancies, and for each month its celestial sign; which work must\r\nhave been held marvellous in those times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RECLINING FEMALE FIGURE FROM A TOMB\r\n\r\n(_After the_ School of Arnolfo di Lapo. _Florence: Collection Bardini_)]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time there was founded the Order of the Friars Minor of\r\nS. Francis, which was confirmed by the said Innocent III, Pontiff, in\r\nthe year 1206; and there came such growth, not only in Italy but in all\r\nthe other parts of the world, both to the devoutness and to the number\r\nof the Friars, that there was scarce a city of account that did not\r\nerect for them churches and convents of the greatest cost, each\r\naccording to its power. Wherefore, Frate Elia having erected, two years\r\nbefore the death of S. Francis (while the Saint himself, as General, was\r\nabroad preaching, and he, Prior in Assisi), a church with the title of\r\nOur Lady, and S. Francis having died, and all Christendom flocking\r\ntogether to visit the body of the Saint, who, in life and in death, had\r\nbeen known as so much the friend of God, and every man making offering\r\nto the holy place according to his power, it was ordained that the said\r\nchurch begun by Frate Elia should be built much greater and more\r\nmagnificent. But there being a dearth of good architects, and the work\r\nwhich was to be done having need of an excellent one, seeing that it had\r\nto be built upon a very high hill at the foot of which there runs a\r\ntorrent called Tescio, there was brought to Assisi, after much\r\nconsideration, as the best of all that were then to be found, one\r\nMaestro Jacopo Tedesco. He, having considered the site and grasped the\r\nwishes of the fathers, who held thereunto a general Chapter in Assisi,\r\ndesigned a very beautiful body of a church and convent, making in the\r\nmodel three tiers, one to be made underground and the others for two\r\nchurches, one of which, on the lower level, should serve as a court,\r\nwith a fairly large portico round it, and the other for a church;\r\nplanning that from the first one should climb to the second by a most\r\nconvenient flight of steps, which should wind round the principal\r\nchapel, opening out into two parts in order to lead more easily into the\r\nsecond church, to which he gave the form of a [Symbol: T], making it\r\nfive times as long as it is broad and dividing one bay from another with\r\ngreat piers of stone, on which he afterwards threw very bold arches,\r\nwith groined vaulting between one and another. From a model so made,\r\nthen, was built this truly very great edifice, and it was followed in\r\nevery part, save in the buttresses above that had to surround the apse\r\nand the principal chapel, and in making the vaulting groined, because\r\nthey did not make it as has been said, but barrel-shaped, in order that\r\nit might be stronger. Next, in front of the principal chapel of the\r\nlower church, they placed the altar, and under that, when it was\r\nfinished, they laid, with most solemn translation, the body of S.\r\nFrancis. And because the true sepulchre which holds the body of the\r\nglorious Saint is in the first--that is, in the lowest church--where no\r\none ever goes, and the doors are walled up, round the said altar there\r\nare very large gratings of iron, with rich ornaments in marble and\r\nmosaic, that look down therein. This building is flanked on one of the\r\nsides by two sacristies, and by a very high campanile, namely, five\r\ntimes as high as it is broad. It had on top a very high octagonal spire,\r\nbut this was removed because it threatened to fall. This whole work was\r\nbrought to a finish in the space of four years, and no more, by the\r\ngenius of Maestro Jacopo Tedesco and by the solicitude of Frate Elia,\r\nafter whose death, to the end that such a pile might never through any\r\nlapse of time fall into ruin, there were built round the lower church\r\ntwelve very stout towers, and in each of these a spiral staircase that\r\nclimbs from the ground up to the summit. And in time, afterwards, there\r\nwere made therein many chapels and other very rich ornaments, whereof\r\nthere is no need to discourse further, since this is enough on this\r\nsubject for the present, and above all because everyone can see how much\r\nof the useful, the ornamental, and the beautiful has been added to this\r\nbeginning of Maestro Jacopo's by many supreme Pontiffs, Cardinals,\r\nPrinces, and other people of importance throughout all Europe.\r\n\r\nNow, to return to Maestro Jacopo; by means of this work he acquired so\r\ngreat fame throughout all Italy that he was summoned by those who then\r\ngoverned the city of Florence, and afterwards received with the greatest\r\npossible friendliness; although, according to the use that the\r\nFlorentines have, and had still more in ancient times, of abbreviating\r\nnames, he was called not Jacopo but Lapo throughout all the course of\r\nhis life; for he dwelt ever with his whole family in that city. And\r\nalthough he went at diverse times to erect many buildings throughout\r\nTuscany, such as the Palace of Poppi in the Casentino, for that Count\r\nwho had had for wife the beautiful Gualdrada, and for her dower, the\r\nCasentino; and for the Aretines, the Vescovado,[7] and the Palazzo\r\nVecchio of the Lords of Pietramala; none the less his home was always in\r\nFlorence, where, having founded in the year 1218 the piers of the Ponte\r\nalla Carraja, which was then called the Ponte Nuovo, he delivered them\r\nfinished in two years; and a little time afterwards the rest was\r\nfinished of wood, as was then the custom. And in the year 1221 he gave\r\nthe design for the Church of S. Salvadore del Vescovado, which was begun\r\nunder his direction, and that of S. Michele in Piazza Padella, where\r\nthere are certain sculptures in the manner of those times. Next, having\r\ngiven the design for draining the waters of the city, having caused the\r\nPiazza di S. Giovanni to be raised, having built, in the time of Messer\r\nRubaconte da Mandella, a Milanese, the bridge that retains the same\r\nman's name, and having discovered that most useful method of paving\r\nstreets, which before were covered with bricks, he made the model of the\r\nPalace, to-day of the Podesta, which was then built for the Anziani. And\r\nfinally, having sent the model of a tomb to Sicily, to the Abbey of\r\nMonreale, for the Emperor Frederick and by order of Manfred, he died,\r\nleaving Arnolfo, his son, heir no less to the talent than to the wealth\r\nof his father.\r\n\r\nThis Arnolfo, from whose talent architecture gained no less betterment\r\nthan painting had gained from that of Cimabue, being born in the year\r\n1232, was thirty years of age when his father died, and was held in very\r\ngreat esteem, for the reason that, having not only learnt from his\r\nfather all that he knew, but having also given attention under Cimabue\r\nto design in order to make use of it in sculpture, he was held by so\r\nmuch the best architect in Tuscany, that not only did the Florentines\r\nfound the last circle of the walls of their city under his direction, in\r\nthe year 1284, and make after his design the Loggia and the piers of Or\r\nSan Michele, where the grain was sold, building them of bricks and with\r\na simple roof above, but by his counsel, in the same year when the\r\nPoggio de' Magnuoli collapsed, on the brow of S. Giorgio above S. Lucia\r\nin the Via de' Bardi, they determined by means of a public decree that\r\nthere should be no more building on the said spot, nor should any\r\nedifice be ever made, seeing that by the sinking of the stones, which\r\nhave water trickling under them, there would be always danger in\r\nwhatsoever edifice might be made there. That this is true has been seen\r\nin our own day from the ruin of many buildings and magnificent houses of\r\nnoblemen. In the next year, 1285, he founded the Loggia and Piazza de'\r\nPriori, and built the principal chapel of the Badia of Florence, and the\r\ntwo that are on either side of it, renovating the church and the choir,\r\nwhich at first had been made much smaller by Count Ugo, founder of that\r\nabbey; and for Cardinal Giovanni degli Orsini, Legate of the Pope in\r\nTuscany, he built the campanile of the said church, which, according to\r\nthe works of those times, was much praised, although it did not have its\r\ncompletion of grey-stone until afterwards, in the year 1330.\r\n\r\nAfter this there was founded with his design, in the year 1294, the\r\nChurch of S. Croce, where the Friars Minor have their seat. What with\r\nthe middle nave and the two lesser ones Arnolfo constructed this so\r\nwide, that, being unable to make the vaulting below the roof by reason\r\nof the too great space, he, with much judgment, caused arches to be made\r\nfrom pier to pier, and upon these he placed the roofs on a slope,\r\nbuilding stone gutters over the said arches in order to carry away the\r\nrain-water, and giving them so much fall as to make the roofs secure, as\r\nthey are, from the danger of rotting; which device was not only new and\r\ningenious then, but is equally useful and worthy of being considered\r\nto-day. He then gave the design for the first cloisters of the old\r\nconvent of that church, and a little time after he caused to be removed\r\nfrom round the Church of S. Giovanni, on the outer side, all the arches\r\nand tombs of marble and grey-stone that were there, and had part of them\r\nplaced behind the campanile on the facade of the Canon's house, beside\r\nthe Company of S. Zanobi; and then he incrusted with black marble from\r\nPrato all the eight outer walls of the said S. Giovanni, removing the\r\ngrey-stone that there had been before between these ancient marbles. The\r\nFlorentines, in the meanwhile, wishing to build walls in the Valdarno di\r\nSopra round Castello di San Giovanni and Castel Franco, for the\r\nconvenience of the city and of their victualling by means of the\r\nmarkets, Arnolfo made the design for them in the year 1295, and\r\nsatisfied them in such a manner, as well in this as he had done in the\r\nother works, that he was made citizen of Florence.\r\n\r\nAfter these works, the Florentines determined, as Giovanni Villani\r\nrelates in his History, to build a principal church in their city, and\r\nto build it such that in point of greatness and magnificence there could\r\nbe desired none larger or more beautiful from the industry and knowledge\r\nof men; and Arnolfo made the design and the model of the never to be\r\nsufficiently praised Church of S. Maria del Fiore, ordering that it\r\nshould be all incrusted, without, with polished marbles and with the so\r\nmany cornices, pilasters, columns, carved foliage, figures, and other\r\nornaments, with which to-day it is seen brought, if not to the whole, to\r\na great part at least of its perfection. And what was marvellous therein\r\nabove everything else was this, that incorporating, besides S. Reparata,\r\nother small churches and houses that were round it, in making the site,\r\nwhich is most beautiful, he showed so great diligence and judgment in\r\ncausing the foundations of so great a fabric to be made broad and deep,\r\nfilling them with good material--namely, with gravel and lime and with\r\ngreat stones below--wherefore the square is still called \"Lungo i\r\nFondamenti,\" that they have been very well able, as is to be seen\r\nto-day, to support the weight of the great mass of the cupola which\r\nFilippo di Ser Brunellesco raised over them. The laying of such\r\nfoundations for so great a church was celebrated with much solemnity,\r\nfor on the day of the Nativity of Our Lady, in 1298, the first stone was\r\nlaid by the Cardinal Legate of the Pope, in the presence not only of\r\nmany Bishops and of all the clergy, but of the Podesta as well, the\r\nCaptains, Priors, and other magistrates of the city, nay, of the whole\r\npeople of Florence, calling it S. Maria del Fiore. And because it was\r\nestimated that the expenses of this fabric must be very great, as they\r\nafterwards were, there was imposed a tax at the Chamber of the Commune\r\nof four danari in the lira on everything that was put out at interest,\r\nand two soldi per head per annum; not to mention that the Pope and the\r\nLegate granted very great indulgences to those who should make them\r\nofferings thereunto. I will not forbear to say, moreover, that besides\r\nthe foundations, very broad and fifteen braccia deep, much consideration\r\nwas shown in making those buttresses of masonry at every angle of the\r\neight sides, seeing that it was these afterwards that emboldened the\r\nmind of Brunellesco to superimpose a much greater weight than that which\r\nArnolfo, perchance, had thought to impose thereon. It is said that while\r\nthe two first side-doors of S. Maria del Fiore were being begun in\r\nmarble Arnolfo caused some fig-leaves to be carved on a frieze, these\r\nbeing the arms of himself and of Maestro Lapo, his father, and that\r\ntherefore it may be believed that from him the family of the Lapi had\r\nits origin, to-day a noble family in Florence. Others say, likewise,\r\nthat from the descendants of Arnolfo there descended Filippo di Ser\r\nBrunellesco. But leaving this, seeing that others believe that the Lapi\r\ncame from Ficaruolo, a township on the mouth of the Po, and returning to\r\nour Arnolfo, I say that by reason of the greatness of this work he\r\ndeserves infinite praise and an eternal name, above all because he\r\ncaused it to be all incrusted, without, with marbles of many colours,\r\nand within, with hard stone, and made even the smallest corners of that\r\nsame stone. But in order that everyone may know the exact size of this\r\nmarvellous fabric, I say that from the door up to the end of the Chapel\r\nof S. Zanobi the length is 260 braccia, and the breadth across the\r\ntransepts 166; across the three naves it is 66 braccia. The middle nave\r\nalone is 72 braccia in height; and the other two lesser naves, 48\r\nbraccia. The external circuit of the whole church is 1,280 braccia. The\r\ncupola, from the ground up to the base of the lantern, is 154 braccia;\r\nthe lantern, without the ball, is 36 braccia in height; the ball, 4\r\nbraccia in height; the cross, 8 braccia in height. The whole cupola,\r\nfrom the ground up to the summit of the cross, is 202 braccia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nTOMB OF ADRIAN V\r\n\r\n(_After the_ School of Arnolfo di Lapo. _Viterbo: Church of S.\r\nFrancesco_)]\r\n\r\nBut returning to Arnolfo, I say that being held, as he was, excellent,\r\nhe had acquired so great trust that nothing of importance was determined\r\nwithout his counsel; wherefore, in the same year, the Commune of\r\nFlorence having finished the foundation of the last circle of the walls\r\nof the city, even as it was said above that they were formerly begun,\r\nand so too the towers of the gates, and all being in great part well\r\nadvanced, he made a beginning for the Palace of the Signori, designing\r\nit in resemblance to that which his father Lapo had built in the\r\nCasentino for the Counts of Poppi. But yet, however magnificent and\r\ngreat he designed it, he could not give it that perfection which his art\r\nand his judgment required, for the following reason: the houses of the\r\nUberti, Ghibellines and rebels against the people of Florence, had been\r\npulled down and thrown to the ground, and a square had been made on the\r\nsite, and the stupid obstinacy of certain men prevailed so greatly that\r\nArnolfo could not bring it about, through whatsoever arguments he might\r\nurge thereunto, that it should be granted to him to put the Palace on a\r\nsquare base, because the governors had refused that the Palace should\r\nhave its foundations in any way whatsoever on the ground of the rebel\r\nUberti. And they brought it about that the northern aisle of S. Pietro\r\nScheraggio should be thrown to the ground, rather than let him work in\r\nthe middle of the square with his own measurements; not to mention that\r\nthey insisted, moreover, that there should be united and incorporated\r\nwith the Palace the Tower of the Foraboschi, called the \"Torre della\r\nVacca,\" in height fifty braccia, for the use of the great bell, and\r\ntogether with it some houses bought by the Commune for this edifice. For\r\nwhich reasons no one must marvel if the foundation of the Palace is awry\r\nand out of the square, it having been necessary, in order to incorporate\r\nthe tower in the middle and to render it stronger, to bind it round with\r\nthe walls of the Palace; which walls, having been laid open in the year\r\n1561 by Giorgio Vasari, painter and architect, were found excellent.\r\nArnolfo, then, having filled up the said tower with good material, it\r\nwas afterwards easy for other masters to make thereon the very high\r\ncampanile that is to be seen there to-day; for within the limits of two\r\nyears he finished only the Palace, which has subsequently received from\r\ntime to time those improvements which give it to-day that greatness and\r\nmajesty that are to be seen.\r\n\r\nAfter all these works and many more that Arnolfo made, no less\r\nconvenient and useful than beautiful, he died at the age of seventy, in\r\n1300, at the very time when Giovanni Villani began to write the\r\nUniversal History of his times. And because he not only left S. Maria\r\ndel Fiore founded, but its three principal tribunes, which are under the\r\ncupola, vaulted, to his own great glory, he well deserved that there\r\nshould be made a memorial of him on the corner of the church opposite\r\nthe Campanile, with these verses carved in marble in round letters:\r\n\r\n     ANNIS .

The portrait of Arnolfo, by the hand of Giotto, is\r\nto be seen in S. Croce, beside the principal chapel, at the beginning of\r\nthe story, where the friars are weeping for the death of S. Francis, in\r\none of two men that are talking together. And the picture of the Church\r\nof S. Maria del Fiore--namely, of the outer side with the cupola--by the\r\nhand of Simone Sanese, is to be seen in the Chapter-house of S. Maria\r\nNovella, copied from the original in wood that Arnolfo made; wherein it\r\nis noticeable that he had thought to raise the dome immediately over the\r\nwalls, at the edge of the first cornice, whereas Filippo di Ser\r\nBrunellesco, in order to relieve them of weight and to make it more\r\ngraceful, added thereto, before he began to raise it, all that height\r\nwherein to-day are the round windows; which circumstance would be even\r\nclearer than it is, if the little care and diligence of those who have\r\ndirected the Works of S. Maria del Fiore in the years past had not left\r\nthe very model that Arnolfo made to go to ruin, and afterwards those of\r\nBrunellesco and of the others.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The braccio is a very variable standard of measurement.

Giovanni, and there being, among many marble\r\nspoils brought by the fleet of the Pisans, certain ancient sarcophagi\r\nthat are to-day in the Campo Santo of that city, there was one of them,\r\nmost beautiful among them all, whereon there was carved the Chase of\r\nMeleager after the Calydonian Boar, in very beautiful manner, seeing\r\nthat both the nude figures and the draped were wrought with much mastery\r\nand with most perfect design. This sarcophagus was placed by the Pisans,\r\nby reason of its beauty, in the side of the Duomo opposite S. Rocco,\r\nbeside the principal side-door, and it served for the body of the mother\r\nof Countess Matilda, if indeed these words are true that are to be read\r\ncarved in the marble:\r\n\r\n      A.D.

Maria sopra Arno in Florence, in the year 1229, placing his\r\nname there, over a door, and in the Church of S. Francesco in Assisi he\r\nmade the marble tomb of the Queen of Cyprus, with many figures, and in\r\nparticular a portrait of her sitting on a lion, in order to show the\r\nstrength of her soul; which Queen, after her death, left a great sum of\r\nmoney to the end that this fabric might be finished. Niccola, then,\r\nhaving made himself known as a much better master than was Fuccio, was\r\nsummoned to Bologna in the year 1225, after the death of S. Domenico\r\nCalagora, first founder of the Order of Preaching Friars, in order to\r\nmake a marble tomb for the said Saint; wherefore, after agreement with\r\nthose who had the charge of it, he made it full of figures in that\r\nmanner wherein it is to be seen to-day, and delivered it finished in the\r\nyear 1231 with much credit to himself, for it was held something\r\nremarkable, and the best of all the works that had been wrought in\r\nsculpture up to that time. He made, likewise, the model of that church\r\nand of a great part of the convent. Afterwards Niccola, returning to\r\nTuscany, found that Fuccio had departed from Florence and had gone to\r\nRome in those days when the Emperor Frederick was crowned by Honorius,\r\nand from Rome with Frederick to Naples, where he finished the Castel di\r\nCapoana, to-day called the Vicaria, wherein are all the tribunals of\r\nthat kingdom, and likewise the Castel dell' Uovo; and where he likewise\r\nfounded the towers he also made the gates over the River Volturno for\r\nthe city of Capua, and a park girt with walls, for fowling, near\r\nGravina, and another for sport in winter at Melfi; besides many other\r\nthings that are not related, for the sake of brevity. Niccola,\r\nmeanwhile, busying himself in Florence, was going on exercising himself\r\nnot only in sculpture but in architecture as well, by means of the\r\nbuildings that were going on being made with some little goodness of\r\ndesign throughout all Italy, and in particular in Tuscany; wherefore he\r\noccupied himself not a little with the building of the Abbey of Settimo,\r\nwhich had not been finished by the executors of Count Ugo of\r\nBrandenburg, like the other six, as was said above. And although it is\r\nread in a marble epitaph on the campanile of the said abbey, GUGLIELM.\r\nME FECIT, it is known, nevertheless, by the manner, that it was directed\r\nwith the counsel of Niccola. About the same time he made the Palazzo\r\nVecchio of the Anziani in Pisa, pulled down in our day by Duke Cosimo,\r\nin order to make the magnificent Palace and Convent of the Knights of S.\r\nStephen on the same spot, using some part of the old, from the design\r\nand model of Giorgio Vasari, painter and architect of Arezzo, who has\r\naccommodated himself to those old walls as well as he has been able in\r\nfitting them into the new. Niccola made, likewise in Pisa, many other\r\npalaces and churches, and he was the first, since the loss of the good\r\nmethod of building, who made it the custom to found edifices in Pisa on\r\npiers, and on these to raise arches, piles having first been sunk under\r\nthe said piers; because, with any other method, the solid base of the\r\nfoundation cracked and the walls always collapsed, whereas the sinking\r\nof piles renders the edifice absolutely safe, even as experience shows.\r\nWith his design, also, was made the Church of S. Michele in Borgo for\r\nthe Monks of Camaldoli. But the most beautiful, the most ingenious, and\r\nthe most whimsical work of architecture that Niccola ever made was the\r\nCampanile of S. Niccola in Pisa, where is the seat of the Friars of S.\r\nAugustine, for the reason that it is octagonal on the outer side and\r\nround within, with stairs that wind in a spiral and lead to the summit,\r\nleaving the hollow space in the middle free, in the shape of a well, and\r\non every fourth step are columns that have the arches above them on a\r\nslant and wind round and round; wherefore, the spring of the vaulting\r\nresting on the said arches, one goes climbing to the summit in a manner\r\nthat he who is on the ground always sees all those who are climbing,\r\nthose who are climbing see those who are on the ground, and those who\r\nare halfway up see both the first and the second--that is, those who are\r\nabove and those who are below. This fanciful invention, with better\r\nmethod and more just proportions, and with more adornment, was\r\nafterwards put into execution by the architect Bramante in the Belvedere\r\nin Rome, for Pope Julius II, and by Antonio da San Gallo in the well\r\nthat is at Orvieto, by order of Pope Clement VII, as will be told when\r\nthe time comes.\r\n\r\nBut returning to Niccola, who was no less excellent as sculptor than as\r\narchitect; in the facade of the Church of S. Martino in Lucca, under the\r\nportico that is above the lesser door, on the left as one enters into\r\nthe church, where there is seen a Christ Deposed from the Cross, he made\r\na marble scene in half-relief, all full of figures wrought with much\r\ndiligence, having hollowed out the marble and finished the whole in a\r\nmanner that gave hope to those who were previously working at the art\r\nwith very great difficulty, that there soon should come one who, with\r\nmore facility, would give them better assistance. The same Niccola, in\r\nthe year 1240, gave the design for the Church of S. Jacopo in Pistoia,\r\nand put to work there in mosaic certain Tuscan masters who made the\r\nvaulting of the choir-niche, which, although in those times it was held\r\nas something difficult and of great cost, moves us to-day rather to\r\nlaughter and to compassion than to marvel, and all the more because such\r\nconfusion, which comes from lack of design, existed not only in Tuscany\r\nbut throughout all Italy, where many buildings and other works, that\r\nwere being wrought without method and without design, give us to know no\r\nless the poverty of their talents than the unmeasured riches wasted by\r\nthe men of those times, by reason of their having had no masters who\r\nmight execute in a good manner any work that they might do.\r\n\r\nNiccola, then, by means of the works that he was making in sculpture and\r\nin architecture, was going on ever acquiring a greater name than the\r\nsculptors and architects who were then working in Romagna, as can be\r\nseen in S. Ippolito and S. Giovanni of Faenza, in the Duomo of Ravenna,\r\nin S. Francesco, in the houses of the Traversari, and in the Church\r\nof Porto; and at Rimini, in the fabric of the public buildings, in the\r\nhouses of the Malatesti, and in other buildings, which are all much\r\nworse than the old edifices made about the same time in Tuscany. And\r\nwhat has been said of Romagna can be also said with truth of a part of\r\nLombardy. A glance at the Duomo of Ferrara, and at the other buildings\r\nmade by the Marquis Azzo, will give us to know that this is the truth\r\nand how different they are from the Santo of Padua, made with the model\r\nof Niccola, and from the Church of the Friars Minor in Venice, both\r\nmagnificent and honoured buildings. Many, in the time of Niccola, moved\r\nby laudable envy, applied themselves with more zeal to sculpture than\r\nthey had done before, and particularly in Milan, whither there assembled\r\nfor the building of the Duomo many Lombards and Germans, who afterwards\r\nscattered throughout Italy by reason of the discords that arose between\r\nthe Milanese and the Emperor Frederick. And so these craftsmen,\r\nbeginning to compete among themselves both in marble and in building,\r\nfound some little of the good. The same came to pass in Florence after\r\nthe works of Arnolfo and Niccola had been seen; and the latter, while\r\nthe little Church of the Misericordia was being erected from his design\r\nin the Piazza di S. Giovanni, made therein in marble, with his own hand,\r\na Madonna with S. Dominic and another Saint, one on either side of her,\r\nwhich may still be seen on the outer facade of the said church.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nTHE ADORATION OF THE MAGI\r\n\r\n(_Detail, after_ Niccola Pisano, _from the Pulpit of the Baptistery,\r\nPisa_)]\r\n\r\nThe Florentines had begun, in the time of Niccola, to throw to the\r\nground many towers made formerly in barbaric manner throughout the whole\r\ncity, in order that the people might be less hurt by reason of these in\r\nthe brawls that were often taking place between the Guelphs and the\r\nGhibellines, or in order that there might be greater security for the\r\nState, and it appeared to them that it would be very difficult to pull\r\ndown the Tower of Guardamorto, which was in the Piazza di S. Giovanni,\r\nbecause the walls had been made so stoutly that they could not be pulled\r\nto pieces with pickaxes, and all the more because it was very high.\r\nWherefore, Niccola causing the foot of the tower to be cut away on one\r\nside and supporting it with wooden props a braccio and a half in length,\r\nand then setting fire to them, as soon as the props were burnt away it\r\nfell and was almost entirely shattered; which was held something so\r\ningenious and useful for such affairs that later it passed into use,\r\ninsomuch that, when there is need, any building is destroyed in very\r\nlittle time with this most easy method. Niccola was present at the first\r\nfoundation of the Duomo of Siena, and designed the Church of S. Giovanni\r\nin the same city; then, having returned to Florence in the same year\r\nthat the Guelphs returned, he designed the Church of S. Trinita, and the\r\nConvent of the Nuns of Faenza, destroyed in our day in order to make the\r\ncitadel. Being next summoned to Naples, in order not to desert the work\r\nin Tuscany he sent thither Maglione, his pupil, a sculptor and\r\narchitect, who afterwards made, in the time of Conradin, the Church of\r\nS. Lorenzo in Naples, finished part of the Piscopio, and made there\r\ncertain tombs, wherein he imitated closely the manner of Niccola, his\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nNiccola, meanwhile, being summoned by the people of Volterra, in the\r\nyear 1254 (when they came under the power of the Florentines), in order\r\nthat their Duomo, which was small, might be enlarged, he brought it to\r\nbetter form, although it was very irregular, and made it more\r\nmagnificent than it was before. Then, having returned finally to Pisa,\r\nhe made the pulpit of S. Giovanni, in marble, putting therein all\r\ndiligence in order to leave a memorial of himself to his country; and\r\namong other things, carving in it the Universal Judgment, he made\r\ntherein many figures, if not with perfect design, at least with infinite\r\npatience and diligence, as can be seen. And because it appeared to him,\r\nas was true, that he had done a work worthy of praise, he carved at the\r\nfoot of it these verses:\r\n\r\n     ANNO MILLENO BIS CENTUM BISQUE TRIDENO\r\n     HOC OPUS INSIGNE SCULPSIT NICOLA PISANUS.\r\n\r\nThe people of Siena, moved by the fame of this work, which greatly\r\npleased not only the Pisans but everyone who saw it, gave to Niccola the\r\nmaking of the pulpit of their Duomo, in which there is sung the Gospel;\r\nGuglielmo Mariscotti being Praetor. In this Niccola made many stories of\r\nJesus Christ, with much credit to himself, by reason of the figures that\r\nare there wrought and with great difficulty almost wholly detached\r\nfrom the marble. Niccola likewise made the design of the Church and\r\nConvent of S. Domenico in Arezzo for the Lords of Pietramala, who\r\nerected it. And at the entreaty of Bishop Ubertini he restored the Pieve\r\nof Cortona, and founded the Church of S. Margherita for the Friars of S.\r\nFrancis, on the highest point of that city.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nTHE VISITATION AND THE NATIVITY\r\n\r\n(_Detail, after_ Niccola Pisano, _from the Pulpit of the Baptistery,\r\nSiena_)]\r\n\r\nWherefore, the fame of Niccola ever growing greater by reason of so\r\ngreat works, he was summoned in the year 1267, by Pope Clement IV, to\r\nViterbo, where, besides many other works, he restored the Church and\r\nConvent of the Preaching Friars. From Viterbo he went to Naples to King\r\nCharles I, who, having routed and slain Conradin on the plain of\r\nTagliacozzo, caused to be made on that spot a very rich church and\r\nabbey, burying therein the infinite number of bodies slain on that day,\r\nand ordaining afterwards that there should be prayers offered by many\r\nmonks, day and night, for their souls; in which building King Charles\r\nwas so well pleased with the work of Niccola that he honoured and\r\nrewarded him very greatly. Returning from Naples to Tuscany, Niccola\r\nstayed in Orvieto for the building of S. Maria, and working there in\r\ncompany with some Germans, he made in marble, for the facade of that\r\nchurch, certain figures in the round, and in particular two scenes of\r\nthe Universal Judgment containing Paradise and Hell; and even as he\r\nstrove, in the Paradise, to give the greatest beauty that he knew to the\r\nsouls of the blessed, restored to their bodies, so too in the Hell he\r\nmade the strangest forms of devils that can possibly be seen, most\r\nintent on tormenting the souls of the damned; and in this work he\r\nsurpassed not merely the Germans who were working there but even his own\r\nself, to his own great credit. And for the reason that he made therein a\r\ngreat number of figures and endured much fatigue, it has been nothing\r\nbut praised up to our own times by those who have had no more judgment\r\nthan this much in sculpture.\r\n\r\nNiccola had, among others, a son called Giovanni, who, because he ever\r\nfollowed his father and applied himself under his teaching to sculpture\r\nand to architecture, in a few years became not only equal to his father\r\nbut in some ways superior; wherefore Niccola, being now old, retired to\r\nPisa, and living there quietly left the management of everything to his\r\nson. Pope Urban IV having died at that time in Perugia, a summons was\r\nsent to Giovanni, who, having gone there, made a tomb of marble for that\r\nPontiff, which, together with that of Pope Martin IV, was afterwards\r\nthrown to the ground when the people of Perugia enlarged their\r\nVescovado, in a manner that there are seen only a few relics of it\r\nscattered throughout the church. And the people of Perugia, at the same\r\ntime, having brought a very great body of water through leaden pipes\r\nfrom the hill of Pacciano, two miles distant from the city, by means of\r\nthe genius and industry of a friar of the Silvestrines, it was given to\r\nGiovanni Pisano to make all the ornaments of the fountain, both in\r\nbronze and in marble; wherefore he put his hand thereto and made three\r\ntiers of basins, two of marble and one of bronze. The first is placed\r\nabove twelve rows of steps, each with twelve sides; the other on some\r\ncolumns that stand on the lowest level of the first basin--that is, in\r\nthe middle; and the third, which is of bronze, rests on three figures,\r\nand has in the middle certain griffins, also of bronze, that pour water\r\non every side; and because it appeared to Giovanni that he had done very\r\nwell in this work, he put on it his name. About the year 1560, the\r\narches and the conduits of this fountain (which cost 160,000 ducats of\r\ngold) having become in great part spoilt and ruined, Vincenzio Danti, a\r\nsculptor of Perugia, without rebuilding the arches, which would have\r\nbeen a thing of the greatest cost, very ingeniously reconducted the\r\nwater to the fountain in the way that it was before, with no small\r\ncredit to himself.\r\n\r\nThis work finished, Giovanni, desiring to see again his old and ailing\r\nfather, departed from Perugia in order to return to Pisa; but, passing\r\nthrough Florence, he was forced to stay, to the end that he might apply\r\nhimself, together with others, to the work of the Mills on the Arno,\r\nwhich were being made at S. Gregorio near the Piazza de' Mozzi. But\r\nfinally, having had news that his father Niccola was dead, he went to\r\nPisa, where, by reason of his worth, he was received by the whole city\r\nwith great honour, every man rejoicing that after the loss of Niccola\r\nthere still remained Giovanni, as heir both of his talents and of his\r\nwealth. And the occasion having come of making proof of him, their\r\nopinion was in no way disappointed, because, there being certain things\r\nto do in the small but most ornate Church of S. Maria della Spina, they\r\nwere given to Giovanni to do, and he, putting his hand thereunto, with\r\nthe help of some of his boys brought many ornaments in that oratory to\r\nthat perfection that is seen to-day; which work, in so far as we can\r\njudge, must have been held miraculous in those times, and all the more\r\nthat he made in one figure the portrait of Niccola from nature, as best\r\nhe knew.\r\n\r\nSeeing this, the Pisans, who long before had had the idea and the wish\r\nto make a place of burial for all the inhabitants of the city, both\r\nnoble and plebeian, either in order not to fill the Duomo with graves or\r\nfor some other reason, caused Giovanni to make the edifice of the Campo\r\nSanto, which is on the Piazza del Duomo, towards the walls; wherefore\r\nhe, with good design and with much judgment, made it in that manner and\r\nwith those ornaments of marble and of that size which are to be seen;\r\nand because there was no consideration of expense, the roof was made of\r\nlead. And outside the principal door there are seen these words carved\r\nin marble:\r\n\r\n      A.D. MCCLXXVIII. TEMPORE DOMINI FREDERIGI ARCHIEPISCOPI PISANI, ET\r\n      DOMINI TARLATI POTESTATIS, OPERARIO ORLANDO SARDELLA, JOHANNE\r\n      MAGISTRO AEDIFICANTE.\r\n\r\nThis work finished, in the same year, 1283, Giovanni went to Naples,\r\nwhere, for King Charles, he made the Castel Nuovo of Naples; and in\r\norder to have room and to make it stronger, he was forced to pull down\r\nmany houses and churches, and in particular a convent of Friars of S.\r\nFrancis, which was afterwards rebuilt no little larger and more\r\nmagnificent than it was before, far from the castle and under the title\r\nof S. Maria della Nuova. These buildings being begun and considerably\r\nadvanced, Giovanni departed from Naples, in order to return to Tuscany;\r\nbut arriving at Siena, without being allowed to go on farther he was\r\ncaused to make the model of the facade of the Duomo of that city, and\r\nafterwards the said facade was made very rich and magnificent from this\r\nmodel. Next, in the year 1286, when the Vescovado of Arezzo was\r\nbuilding with the design of Margaritone, architect of Arezzo, Giovanni\r\nwas brought from Siena to Arezzo by Guglielmino Ubertini, Bishop of that\r\ncity, where he made in marble the panel of the high-altar, all filled\r\nwith carvings of figures, of foliage, and other ornaments, distributing\r\nthroughout the whole work certain things in delicate mosaic, and enamels\r\nlaid on plates of silver, let into the marble with much diligence. In\r\nthe middle is a Madonna with the Child in her arms, and on one side S.\r\nGregory the Pope, whose face is the portrait from life of Pope Honorius\r\nIV; and on the other side is S. Donatus, Bishop and Protector of that\r\ncity, whose body, with those of S. Antilla and of other Saints, is laid\r\nunder that same altar. And because the said altar stands out by itself,\r\nround it and on the sides there are small scenes in low-relief from the\r\nlife of S. Donatus, and the crown of the whole work are certain\r\ntabernacles full of marble figures in the round, wrought with much\r\nsubtlety. On the breast of the said Madonna is a bezel-shaped setting of\r\ngold, wherein, so it is said, were jewels of much value, which have been\r\ncarried away in the wars, so it is thought, by soldiers, who have no\r\nrespect, very often, even for the most holy Sacrament, together with\r\nsome little figures in the round that were on the top of and around that\r\nwork; on which the Aretines spent altogether, according to what is found\r\nin certain records, 30,000 florins of gold. Nor does this seem anything\r\ngreat, seeing that at that time it was something as precious and rare as\r\nit could well be; wherefore Frederick Barbarossa, returning from Rome,\r\nwhere he had been crowned, and passing through Arezzo, many years after\r\nit had been made, praised it, nay, admired it infinitely; and in truth\r\nwith great reason, seeing that, besides everything else, the joinings of\r\nthis work, made of innumerable pieces, are cemented and put together so\r\nwell that the whole work is easily judged, by anyone who has not much\r\npractice in the matters of the art, to be all of one piece. In the same\r\nchurch Giovanni made the Chapel of the Ubertini, a most noble family,\r\nand lords of castles, as they still are to-day and were formerly even\r\nmore; with many ornaments of marble, which to-day have been covered over\r\nwith other ornaments of grey-stone, many and fine, which were set up in\r\nthat place with the design of Giorgio Vasari in the year 1535, for\r\nthe supporting of an organ of extraordinary excellence and beauty that\r\nstands thereon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Lombardi_\r\n\r\nA SYBIL\r\n\r\n(_Detail, after_ Giovanni Pisano, _from the facade of the Duomo,\r\nSiena_)]\r\n\r\nGiovanni Pisano likewise made the design of the Church of S. Maria de'\r\nServi, which to-day has been destroyed, together with many palaces of\r\nthe most noble families of the city, for the reasons mentioned above. I\r\nwill not forbear to say that Giovanni made use, in working on the said\r\nmarble altar, of certain Germans who had apprenticed themselves to him\r\nrather for learning than for gain; and under his teaching they became\r\nsuch that, having gone after this work to Rome, they served Boniface\r\nVIII in many works of sculpture for S. Pietro, and in architecture when\r\nhe made Civita Castellana. Besides this, they were sent by the same man\r\nto S. Maria in Orvieto, where, for its facade, they made many figures in\r\nmarble which were passing good for those times. But among others who\r\nassisted Giovanni in the work of the Vescovado in Arezzo, Agostino and\r\nAgnolo, sculptors and architects of Siena, surpassed in time all the\r\nothers, as will be told in the proper place. But returning to Giovanni;\r\nhaving departed from Orvieto, he came to Florence, in order to see the\r\nfabric of S. Maria del Fiore that Arnolfo was making, and likewise to\r\nsee Giotto, of whom he had heard great things spoken abroad; and no\r\nsooner had he arrived in Florence than he was charged by the Wardens of\r\nthe said fabric of S. Maria del Fiore to make the Madonna which is over\r\nthat door of the church that leads to the Canon's house, between two\r\nlittle angels; which work was then much praised. Next, he made the\r\nlittle baptismal font of S. Giovanni, wherein are certain scenes in\r\nhalf-relief from the life of that Saint. Having then gone to Bologna, he\r\ndirected the building of the principal chapel of the Church of S.\r\nDomenico, wherein he was charged by Bishop Teodorigo Borgognoni of\r\nLucca, a friar of that Order, to make an altar of marble; and in the\r\nsame place he afterwards made, in the year 1298, the marble panel\r\nwherein are the Madonna and eight other figures, reasonably good.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1300, Niccola da Prato, Cardinal Legate of the Pope, being\r\nin Florence in order to accommodate the dissensions of the Florentines,\r\ncaused him to make a convent for nuns in Prato, which is called S.\r\nNiccola from his name, and to restore in the same territory the Convent\r\nof S. Domenico, and so too that of Pistoia; in both the one and the\r\nother of which there are still seen the arms of the said Cardinal. And\r\nbecause the people of Pistoia held in veneration the name of Niccola,\r\nfather of Giovanni, by reason of that which he had wrought in that city\r\nwith his talent, they caused Giovanni himself to make a pulpit of marble\r\nfor the Church of S. Andrea, like to the one which he had made in the\r\nDuomo of Siena; and this he did in order to compete with one which had\r\nbeen made a little before in the Church of S. Giovanni Evangelista by a\r\nGerman, who was therefore much praised. Giovanni, then, delivered his\r\nfinished in four years, having divided this work into five scenes from\r\nthe life of Jesus Christ, and having made therein, besides this, a\r\nUniversal Judgment, with the greatest diligence that he knew, in order\r\nto equal or perchance to surpass the one of Orvieto, then so greatly\r\nrenowned. And round the said pulpit, on the architrave, over some\r\ncolumns that support it, thinking (as was the truth, according to the\r\nknowledge of that age) that he had done a great and beautiful work, he\r\ncarved these verses:\r\n\r\n     HOC OPUS SCULPSIT JOANNES, QUI RES NON EGIT INANES,\r\n     NICOLI NATUS ...... MELIORA BEATUS,\r\n     QUEM GENUIT PISA, DOCTUM SUPER OMNIA VISA.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Giovanni made the holy-water font, in marble, of the\r\nChurch of S. Giovanni Evangelista in the same city, with three figures\r\nthat support it--Temperance, Prudence, and Justice; which work, by\r\nreason of its having then been held very beautiful, was placed in the\r\ncentre of that church as something remarkable. And before he departed\r\nfrom Pistoia, although the work had not up to then been begun, he made\r\nthe model of the Campanile of S. Jacopo, the principal church of that\r\ncity; on which campanile, which is on the square of the said S. Jacopo\r\nand beside the church, there is this date: A.D. 1301.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nTHE MASSACRE OF THE INNOCENTS\r\n\r\n(_Detail, after_ Giovanni Pisano, _from the Pulpit of the Church of S.\r\nAndrea, Pistoia_)]\r\n\r\nAfterwards, Pope Benedict IX having died in Perugia, a summons was sent\r\nto Giovanni, who, having gone to Perugia, made a tomb of marble for that\r\nPontiff in the old Church of S. Domenico, belonging to the Preaching\r\nFriars; the Pope, portrayed from nature and robed in his pontifical\r\nhabits, is lying at full length on the bier, with two angels, one on\r\neither side, that are holding up a curtain, and above there is a Madonna\r\nwith two saints in relief, one on either side of her; and many other\r\nornaments are carved round that tomb. In like manner, in the new church\r\nof the said Preaching Friars he made the tomb of Messer Niccolo\r\nGuidalotti of Perugia, Bishop of Recanati, who was founder of the\r\nSapienza Nuova of Perugia. In this new church, which had been founded\r\nbefore this by others, he executed the central nave, which was founded\r\nby him with much better method than the remainder of the church had\r\nbeen; for on one side it leans and threatens to fall down, by reason of\r\nhaving been badly founded. And in truth, he who puts his hand to\r\nbuilding and to doing anything of importance should ever take counsel,\r\nnot from him who knows little but from the best, in order not to have to\r\nrepent after the act, with loss and shame, that where he most needed\r\ngood counsel he took the bad.\r\n\r\nGiovanni, having dispatched his business in Perugia, wished to go to\r\nRome, in order to learn from those few ancient things that were to be\r\nseen there, even as his father had done; but being hindered by good\r\nreasons, this his desire did not take effect, and the rather as he heard\r\nthat the Court had just gone to Avignon. Returning, then, to Pisa, Nello\r\ndi Giovanni Falconi, Warden, caused him to make the great pulpit of the\r\nDuomo, which is on the right hand going towards the high-altar, attached\r\nto the choir; and having made a beginning with this and with many\r\nfigures in the round, three braccia high, that were to serve for it,\r\nlittle by little he brought them to that form that is seen to-day,\r\nplacing the pulpit partly on the said figures and partly on some columns\r\nsustained by lions; and on the sides he made some scenes from the life\r\nof Christ. It is a pity, truly, that so great cost, so great diligence,\r\nand so great labour should not have been accompanied by good design and\r\nshould be wanting in perfection and in excellence of invention, grace,\r\nand manner, such as any work of our own times would show, even if made\r\nwith much less cost and labour. None the less, it must have caused no\r\nsmall marvel to the men of those times, used to seeing only the rudest\r\nworks. This work was finished in the year 1320, as appears in certain\r\nverses that are round the said pulpit, which run thus:\r\n\r\n     LAUDO DEUM VERUM, PER QUEM SUNT OPTIMA RERUM,\r\n     QUI DEDIT HAS PURAS HOMINEM FORMARE FIGURAS;\r\n     HOC OPUS HIS ANNIS DOMINI SCULPSERE JOHANNIS\r\n     ARTE MANUS SOLE QUONDAM, NATIQUE NICOLE,\r\n     CURSIS VENTENIS TERCENTUM MILLEQUE PLENIS;\r\n\r\nwith other thirteen verses, which are not written, in order not to weary\r\nthe reader, and because these are enough not only to bear witness that\r\nthe said pulpit is by the hand of Giovanni, but also that the men of\r\nthese times were in all things made thus. A Madonna of marble, also,\r\nthat is seen between S. John the Baptist and another Saint, over the\r\nprincipal door of the Duomo, is by the hand of Giovanni; and he who is\r\nat the feet of the Madonna, on his knees, is said to be Piero\r\nGambacorti, Warden of Works. However this may be, on the base whereon\r\nstands the image of Our Lady there are carved these words:\r\n\r\n     SUB PETRI CURA HAEC PIA FUIT SCULPTA FIGURA,\r\n       NICOLI NATO SCULPTORE JOHANNE VOCATO.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, over the side door that is opposite the campanile, there\r\nis a Madonna of marble by the hand of Giovanni, having on one side a\r\nwoman kneeling with two babies, representing Pisa, and on the other the\r\nEmperor Henry. On the base whereon stands the Madonna are these words:\r\n\r\n     AVE GRATIA PLENA, DOMINUS TECUM;\r\n\r\nand beside them:\r\n\r\n     NOBILIS ARTE MANUS SCULPSIT JOHANNES PISANUS\r\n       SCULPSIT SUB BURGUNDIO TADI BENIGNO....\r\n\r\nAnd round the base of Pisa:\r\n\r\n     VIRGINIS ANCILLA SUM PISA QUIETA SUB ILLA.\r\n\r\nAnd round the base of Henry:\r\n\r\n     IMPERAT HENRICUS QUI CHRISTO FERTUR AMICUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nMADONNA AND CHILD\r\n\r\n(_After_ Giovanni Pisano. _Padua: Arena Chapel_)]\r\n\r\nIn the old Pieve of the territory of Prato, under the altar of the\r\nprincipal chapel, there had been kept for many years the Girdle of Our\r\nLady, which Michele da Prato, returning from the Holy Land, had brought\r\nto his country in the year 1141 and consigned to Uberto, Provost of that\r\nchurch, who placed it where it has been said, and where it had been ever\r\nheld in great veneration; and in the year 1312 an attempt was made to\r\nsteal it by a man of Prato, a fellow of the basest sort, and as it were,\r\nanother Ser Ciappelletto; but having been discovered, he was put to\r\ndeath for sacrilege by the hand of justice. Moved by this, the people of\r\nPrato determined to make a strong and suitable resting-place, in order\r\nto hold the said Girdle more securely; wherefore, having summoned\r\nGiovanni, who was now old, they made with his counsel, in the greater\r\nchurch, the chapel wherein there is now preserved the said Girdle of Our\r\nLady. And next, with the same man's design, they made the said church\r\nmuch larger than it was before, and encrusted it without with white and\r\nblack marbles, and likewise the campanile, as may be seen. Finally,\r\nbeing now very old, Giovanni died in the year 1320, after having made,\r\nbesides those that have been mentioned, many other works in sculpture\r\nand in architecture. And in truth there is much owed to him and to his\r\nfather Niccola, seeing that, in times void of all goodness of design,\r\nthey gave in so great darkness no small light to the matters of these\r\narts, wherein they were, for that age, truly excellent. Giovanni was\r\nburied in the Campo Santo, with great honour, in the same grave wherein\r\nhad been laid Niccola, his father. There were as disciples of Giovanni\r\nmany who flourished after him, but in particular Lino, sculptor and\r\narchitect of Siena, who made in the Duomo of Pisa the chapel all adorned\r\nwith marble wherein is the body of S. Ranieri, and likewise the\r\nbaptismal font that is in the said Duomo, with his name.\r\n\r\nNor let anyone marvel that Niccola and Giovanni did so many works,\r\nbecause, not to mention that they lived very long, being the first\r\nmasters that were in Europe at that time, there was nothing done of any\r\nimportance in which they did not have a hand, as can be seen in many\r\ninscriptions besides those that have been mentioned. And seeing that,\r\nwhile touching on these two sculptors and architects, there has been\r\nsomething said of matters in Pisa, I will not forbear to say that on the\r\ntop of the steps in front of the new hospital, round the base that\r\nsupports a lion and the vase that rests on the porphyry column, are\r\nthese words:\r\n\r\n      THIS IS THE MEASURE WHICH THE EMPEROR CAESAR GAVE TO PISA,\r\n     WHEREWITH THERE WAS MEASURED THE TRIBUTE THAT WAS PAID TO HIM;\r\n     WHICH HAS BEEN SET UP OVER THIS COLUMN AND LION, IN THE TIME OF\r\n     GIOVANNI ROSSO, WARDEN OF THE WORKS OF S. MARIA MAGGIORE IN PISA,\r\n     A.D. MCCCXIII., IN THE SECOND INDICTION, IN MARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANDREA TAFI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF ANDREA TAFI,\r\n\r\nPAINTER OF FLORENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nEven as the works of Cimabue awakened no small marvel (he having given\r\nbetter design and form to the art of painting) in the men of those\r\ntimes, used to seeing nothing save works done after the Greek manner,\r\neven so the works in mosaic of Andrea Tafi, who lived in the same times,\r\nwere admired, and he thereby held excellent, nay, divine; these people\r\nnot thinking, being unused to see anything else, that better work could\r\nbe done in such an art. But not being in truth the most able man in the\r\nworld, and having considered that mosaic, by reason of its long life,\r\nwas held in estimation more than all the other forms of painting, he\r\nwent from Florence to Venice, where some Greek painters were working in\r\nS. Marco in mosaic; and becoming intimate with them, with entreaties,\r\nwith money, and with promises he contrived in such a manner that he\r\nbrought to Florence Maestro Apollonio, a Greek painter, who taught him\r\nto fuse the glass for mosaic and to make the cement for putting it\r\ntogether; and in his company he wrought the upper part of the tribune of\r\nS. Giovanni, where there are the Powers, the Thrones, and the Dominions;\r\nin which place Andrea, when more practised, afterwards made, as will be\r\nsaid below, the Christ that is over the side of the principal chapel.\r\nBut having made mention of S. Giovanni, I will not pass by in silence\r\nthat this ancient temple is all wrought, both without and within, with\r\nmarbles of the Corinthian Order, and that it is not only designed and\r\nexecuted perfectly in all its parts and with all its proportions, but\r\nalso very well adorned with doors and with windows, and enriched with\r\ntwo columns of granite on each wall-face, each eleven braccia high, in\r\norder to make the three spaces over which are the architraves, that rest\r\non the said columns in order to support the whole mass of the double\r\nvaulted roof, which has been praised by modern architects as something\r\nremarkable, and deservedly, for the reason that it showed the good which\r\nthat art already had in itself to Filippo di Ser Brunellesco, to\r\nDonatello, and to the other masters of those times, who learnt the art\r\nby means of this work and of the Church of S. Apostolo in Florence, a\r\nwork so good in manner that it casts back to the true ancient goodness,\r\nhaving all the columns in sections, as it has been said above, measured\r\nand put together with so great diligence that much can be learnt by\r\nstudying it in all its parts. But to be silent about many things that\r\ncould be said about the good architecture of this church, I will say\r\nonly that there was a great departure from this example and from this\r\ngood method of working when the facade of S. Miniato sul Monte without\r\nFlorence was rebuilt in marble, in honour of the conversion of the\r\nBlessed S. Giovanni Gualberto, citizen of Florence and founder of the\r\nOrder of the Monks of Vallombrosa; because that and many other works\r\nthat were made later were in no way similar in beauty to those\r\nmentioned. The same, in like manner, came to pass in the works of\r\nsculpture, for all those that were made in Italy by the masters of that\r\nage, as has been said in the Preface to the Lives, were very rude, as\r\ncan be seen in many places, and in particular in S. Bartolommeo at\r\nPistoia, a church of the Canons Regular, where, in a pulpit very rudely\r\nmade by Guido da Como, there is the beginning of the life of Jesus\r\nChrist, with these words carved thereon by the craftsman himself in the\r\nyear 1199:\r\n\r\n     SCULPTOR LAUDATUR, QUOD DOCTUS IN ARTE PROBATUR,\r\n          GUIDO DE COMO ME CUNCTIS CARMINE PROMO.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Church of S. Giovanni; forbearing to relate its\r\norigin, by reason of its having been described by Giovanni Villani and\r\nby other writers, and having already said that from this church there\r\ncame the good architecture that is to-day in use, I will add that the\r\ntribune was made later, so far as it is known, and that at the time when\r\nAlesso Baldovinetti, succeeding Lippo, a painter of Florence, restored\r\nthose mosaics, it was seen that it had been in the past painted with\r\ndesigns in red, and all worked on stucco.\r\n\r\nAndrea Tafi and Apollonio the Greek, then, in order to cover this\r\ntribune with mosaics, made therein a number of compartments, which,\r\nnarrow at the top beside the lantern, went on widening as far as the\r\nlevel of the cornice below; and they divided the upper part into circles\r\nof various scenes. In the first are all the ministers and executors of\r\nthe Divine Will, namely, the Angels, the Archangels, the Cherubim, the\r\nSeraphim, the Powers, the Thrones, and the Dominions. In the second row,\r\nalso in mosaic, and after the Greek manner, are the principal works done\r\nby God, from the creation of light down to the Flood. In the circle that\r\nis below these, which goes on widening with the eight sides of that\r\ntribune, are all the acts of Joseph and of his twelve brethren. Below\r\nthese, then, there follow as many other spaces of the same size that\r\ncircle in like manner onward, wherein there is the life of Jesus Christ,\r\nalso in mosaic, from the time when He was conceived in Mary's womb up to\r\nthe Ascension into Heaven. Then, resuming the same order, under the\r\nthree friezes there is the life of S. John the Baptist, beginning with\r\nthe appearing of the Angel to Zacharias the priest, up to his beheading\r\nand to the burial that his disciples gave him. All these works, being\r\nrude, without design and without art, I do not absolutely praise; but of\r\na truth, having regard to the method of working of that age and to the\r\nimperfection that the art of painting then showed, not to mention that\r\nthe work is solid and that the pieces of the mosaic are very well put\r\ntogether, the end of this work is much better--or to speak more exactly,\r\nless bad--than is the beginning, although the whole, with respect to the\r\nwork of to-day, moves us rather to laughter than to pleasure or marvel.\r\nFinally, over the side of the principal chapel in the said tribune,\r\nAndrea made by himself and without the help of Apollonio, to his own\r\ngreat credit, the Christ that is still seen there to-day, seven braccia\r\nhigh. Becoming famous for these works throughout all Italy, and being\r\nreputed in his own country as excellent, he well deserved to be largely\r\nhonoured and rewarded. It was truly very great good-fortune, that of\r\nAndrea, to be born at a time when, all work being rudely done, there was\r\ngreat esteem even for that which deserved to be esteemed very little, or\r\nrather not at all. This same thing befell Fra Jacopo da Turrita, of the\r\nOrder of S. Francis, seeing that, having made the works in mosaic that\r\nare in the recess behind the altar of the said S. Giovanni,\r\nnotwithstanding that they were little worthy of praise he was\r\nremunerated for them with extraordinary rewards, and afterwards, as an\r\nexcellent master, summoned to Rome, where he wrought certain things in\r\nthe chapel of the high-altar of S. Giovanni Laterano, and in that of S.\r\nMaria Maggiore. Next, being summoned to Pisa, he made the Evangelists in\r\nthe principal apse of the Duomo, with other works that are there,\r\nassisted by Andrea Tafi and by Gaddo Gaddi, and using the same manner\r\nwherein he had done his other works; but he left them little less than\r\nwholly imperfect, and they were afterwards finished by Vicino.\r\n\r\nThe works of these men, then, were prized for some time; but when the\r\nworks of Giotto, as will be said in its own place, were set in\r\ncomparison with those of Andrea, of Cimabue, and of the others, people\r\nrecognized in part the perfection of the art, seeing the difference that\r\nthere was between the early manner of Cimabue and that of Giotto, in the\r\nfigures of the one and of the other and in those that their disciples\r\nand imitators made. From this beginning the others sought step by step\r\nto follow in the path of the best masters, surpassing one another\r\nhappily from one day to another, so that from such depths these arts\r\nhave been raised, as is seen, to the height of their perfection.\r\n\r\nAndrea lived eighty-one years, and died before Cimabue, in 1294. And by\r\nreason of the reputation and the honour that he gained with his mosaic,\r\nseeing that he, before any other man, introduced and taught it in better\r\nmanner to the men of Tuscany, he was the cause that Gaddo Gaddi, Giotto,\r\nand the others afterwards made the most excellent works of that craft\r\nwhich have acquired for them fame and an eternal name. After the death\r\nof Andrea there was not wanting one to magnify him with this\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n      QUI GIACE ANDREA, CH' OPRE LEGGIADRE E BELLE\r\n      FECE IN TUTTA TOSCANA, ED ORA E ITO\r\n      A FAR VAGO LO REGNO DELLE STELLE.\r\n\r\nA disciple of Andrea was Buonamico Buffalmacco, who, being very young,\r\nplayed him many tricks, and had from him the portrait of Pope Celestine\r\nIV, a Milanese, and that of Innocent IV, both one and the other of whom\r\nhe portrayed afterwards in the pictures that he made in S. Paolo a Ripa\r\nd' Arno in Pisa. A disciple and perhaps a son of the same man was\r\nAntonio d'Andrea Tafi, who was a passing good painter; but I have not\r\nbeen able to find any work by his hand. There is only mention made of\r\nhim in the old book of the Company of the Men of Design.\r\n\r\nDeservedly, then, did Andrea Tafi gain much praise among the early\r\nmasters, for the reason that, although he learnt the principles of\r\nmosaic from those whom he brought from Venice to Florence, he added\r\nnevertheless so much of the good to the art, putting the pieces together\r\nwith much diligence and executing the work smooth as a table, which is\r\nof the greatest importance in mosaic, that he opened the way to good\r\nwork to Giotto, among others, as will be told in his Life; and not only\r\nto Giotto, but to all those who have exercised themselves in this sort\r\nof painting from his day up to our own times. Wherefore it can be truly\r\naffirmed that those marvellous works which are being made to-day in S.\r\nMarco at Venice, and in other places, had their first beginning from\r\nAndrea Tafi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGADDO GADDI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF GADDO GADDI,\r\n\r\nPAINTER OF FLORENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nGaddo, painter of Florence, displayed at this same time more design in\r\nhis works, wrought after the Greek manner, than did Andrea Tafi and the\r\nother painters that were before him, and this perchance arose from the\r\nintimate friendship and intercourse that he held with Cimabue, seeing\r\nthat, by reason either of their conformity of blood or of the goodness\r\nof their minds, finding themselves united one to the other by a strait\r\naffection, from the frequent converse that they had together and from\r\ntheir discoursing lovingly very often about the difficulties of the arts\r\nthere were born in their minds conceptions very beautiful and grand; and\r\nthis came to pass for them the more easily inasmuch as they were\r\nassisted by the subtlety of the air of Florence, which is wont to\r\nproduce spirits both ingenious and subtle, removing continually from\r\nround them that little of rust and grossness that most times nature is\r\nnot able to remove, together with the emulation and with the precepts\r\nthat the good craftsmen provide in every age. And it is seen clearly\r\nthat works concerted between those who, in their friendship, are not\r\nveiled with the mask of duplicity (although few so made are to be\r\nfound), arrive at much perfection; and the same men, conferring on the\r\ndifficulties of the sciences that they are learning, purge them and\r\nrender them so clear and easy that the greatest praise comes therefrom.\r\nWhereas some, on the contrary, diabolically working with profession of\r\nfriendship, and using the cloak of truth and of lovingness to conceal\r\ntheir envy and malice, rob them of their conceptions, in a manner that\r\nthe arts do not so soon attain to that excellence which they would if\r\nlove embraced the minds of the gracious spirits; as it truly bound\r\ntogether Gaddo and Cimabue, and in like manner Andrea Tafi and Gaddo,\r\nwho was taken by Andrea into company with himself in order to finish the\r\nmosaics of S. Giovanni, where that Gaddo learnt so much that afterwards\r\nhe made by himself the Prophets that are seen round that church in the\r\nsquare spaces beneath the windows; and having wrought these by his own\r\nself and with much better manner, they brought him very great fame.\r\nWherefore, growing in courage and being disposed to work by himself, he\r\napplied himself continually to studying the Greek manner together with\r\nthat of Cimabue. Whence, after no long time, having become excellent in\r\nthe art, there was allotted to him by the Wardens of Works of S. Maria\r\ndel Fiore the lunette over the principal door within the church, wherein\r\nhe wrought in mosaic the Coronation of Our Lady; which work, when\r\nfinished, was judged by all the masters, both foreign and native, the\r\nmost beautiful that had yet been seen in all Italy in that craft, there\r\nbeing recognized therein more design, more judgment, and more\r\ndiligence than in all the rest of the works in mosaic that were then\r\nto be found in Italy.\r\n\r\nWherefore, the fame of this work spreading, Gaddo was called to Rome in\r\nthe year 1308 (which was the year after the fire that burnt down the\r\nChurch and the Palaces of the Lateran) by Clement V, for whom he\r\nfinished certain works in mosaic left imperfect by Fra Jacopo da\r\nTurrita. He then wrought certain works, also in mosaic, in the Church of\r\nS. Pietro, both in the principal chapel and throughout the church, and\r\nin particular a large God the Father, with many other figures, on the\r\nfacade; and helping to finish some scenes in mosaic that are in the\r\nfacade of S. Maria Maggiore, he somewhat improved the manner, and\r\ndeparted also a little from that manner of the Greeks, which had in it\r\nnothing whatever of the good.\r\n\r\nNext, having returned to Tuscany, he wrought in the Duomo Vecchio\r\nwithout the city of Arezzo, for the Tarlati, Lords of Pietramala,\r\ncertain works in mosaic on a vault that was all made of sponge-stone and\r\nserved for roof to the middle part of that church, which, being too much\r\nburdened by the ancient vault of stone, fell down in the time of Bishop\r\nGentile of Urbino, who had it afterwards all rebuilt with bricks.\r\nDeparting from Arezzo, Gaddo went to Pisa, where, in the niche over the\r\nChapel of the Incoronata in the Duomo, he made a Madonna who is\r\nascending into Heaven, and, above, a Jesus Christ who is awaiting her\r\nand has a rich chair prepared as a seat for her; which work, for those\r\ntimes, was wrought so well and with so great diligence that it has been\r\nvery well preserved, even to our own day. After this Gaddo returned to\r\nFlorence, in mind to rest; wherefore, undertaking to make little panels\r\nin mosaic, he executed some with egg-shells, with incredible diligence\r\nand patience, as can be seen, among others, in some that are still\r\nto-day in the Church of S. Giovanni in Florence. It is read, also, that\r\nhe made two of them for King Robert, but nothing more is known of these.\r\nAnd let this be enough to have said of Gaddo Gaddi with regard to work\r\nin mosaic.\r\n\r\nIn painting he made many panels, and among others that which is in S.\r\nMaria Novella, in the tramezzo[8] of the church, in the Chapel of the\r\nMinerbetti, and many others that were sent into diverse parts of\r\nTuscany. And working thus, now in mosaic and now in painting, he made\r\nboth in the one and in the other exercise many passing good works, which\r\nmaintained him ever in good credit and reputation. I could here enlarge\r\nfurther in discoursing of Gaddo, but seeing that the manners of the\r\npainters of those times cannot, for the most part, render great\r\nassistance to the craftsmen, I will pass this over in silence, reserving\r\nmyself to be longer in the Lives of those who, having improved the arts,\r\ncan give some measure of assistance.\r\n\r\nGaddo lived seventy-three years, and died in 1312, and was given\r\nhonourable burial in S. Croce by his son Taddeo. And although he had\r\nother sons, Taddeo alone, who was held at the baptismal font by Giotto,\r\napplied himself to painting, learning at first the principles from his\r\nfather and then the rest from Giotto. A disciple of Gaddo, besides\r\nTaddeo his son, was Vicino, painter of Pisa, who wrought very well\r\ncertain works in mosaic in the principal apse of the Duomo of Pisa, as\r\nthese words demonstrate, that are still seen in that apse:\r\n\r\n      TEMPORE DOMINI JOANNIS ROSSI, OPERARII ISTIUS ECCLESIAE, VICINUS\r\n      PICTOR INCEPIT ET PERFECIT HANC IMAGINEM BEATAE MARIAE; SED\r\n      MAJESTATIS, ET EVANGELISTAE, PER ALIOS INCEPTAE, IPSE COMPLEVIT ET\r\n      PERFECIT, A.D. 1321, DE MENSE SEPTEMBRIS. BENEDICTUM SIT NOMEN\r\n      DOMINI DEI NOSTRI JESU CHRISTI. AMEN.\r\n\r\nIn the Chapel of the Baroncelli, in the same Church of S. Croce, there\r\nis a portrait of Gaddo by the hand of his son Taddeo, in a Marriage of\r\nOur Lady, and beside him is Andrea Tafi. And in our aforesaid book there\r\nis a drawing by the hand of Gaddo, made in miniature, like that of\r\nCimabue, wherein it is seen how strong he was in draughtsmanship.\r\n\r\nNow, seeing that in an old book, from which I have drawn these few facts\r\nthat have been related about Gaddo Gaddi, there is also an account of\r\nthe building of S. Maria Novella, the Church of the Preaching Friars in\r\nFlorence, a building truly magnificent and highly honoured, I will not\r\npass by in silence by whom and at what time it was built. I say, then,\r\nthat the Blessed Dominic being in Bologna, and there being conceded to\r\nhim the property of Ripoli without Florence, he sent thither twelve\r\nfriars under the care of the Blessed Giovanni da Salerno; and not many\r\nyears afterwards these friars came to Florence to occupy the church and\r\nprecincts of S. Pancrazio, and they were settled there, when Dominic\r\nhimself came to Florence, whereupon they left that place and went to\r\nsettle in the Church of S. Paolo, according to his pleasure. Later,\r\nthere being conceded to the said Blessed Giovanni the precincts of S.\r\nMaria Novella, with all its wealth, by the Legate of the Pope and by the\r\nBishop of the city, they were put in possession and began to occupy the\r\nsaid precincts on the last day of October, 1221. And because the said\r\nchurch was passing small and faced westward, with its entrance on the\r\nPiazza Vecchia, the friars, being now grown to a good number and having\r\ngreat repute in the city, began to think of increasing the said church\r\nand convent. Wherefore, having got together a very great sum of money,\r\nand having many in the city who were promising every assistance, they\r\nbegan the building of the new church on St. Luke's Day, in 1278; the\r\nfirst stone of the foundations being most solemnly laid by Cardinal\r\nLatino degli Orsini, Legate of Pope Nicholas III to the Florentines. The\r\narchitects of the said church were Fra Giovanni, a Florentine, and Fra\r\nRistoro da Campi, lay-brothers of the same Order, who rebuilt the Ponte\r\nalla Carraja and that of S. Trinita, destroyed by the flood of 1264 on\r\nOctober 1. The greater part of the site of the said church and convent\r\nwas presented to the friars by the heirs of Messer Jacopo, Cavaliere de'\r\nTornaquinci. The cost, as has been said, was met partly by alms and\r\npartly by the money of diverse persons who assisted gallantly, and in\r\nparticular with the assistance of Frate Aldobrandino Cavalcanti, who was\r\nafterwards Bishop of Arezzo and is buried over the door of the Virgin.\r\nSome say that, besides everything else, he got together by his own\r\nindustry all the labour and material that went into the said church,\r\nwhich was finished when the Prior of this convent was Fra Jacopo\r\nPassavanti, who was therefore deemed worthy of a marble tomb in front of\r\nthe principal chapel, on the left hand. This church was consecrated in\r\nthe year 1420, by Pope Martin V, as is seen in an inscription on marble\r\non the righthand pillar of the principal chapel, which runs thus:\r\n\r\n      A.D. 1420. DIE SEPTIMA SEPTEMBRIS, DOMINUS MARTINUS DIVINA\r\n      PROVIDENTIA PAPA V. PERSONALITER HANC ECCLESIAM CONSECRAVIT, ET\r\n      MAGNAS INDULGENTIAS CONTULIT VISITANTIBUS EANDEM.\r\n\r\nOf all these things and of many others there is an account in a\r\nchronicle of the building of the said church, which is in the hands of\r\nthe fathers of S. Maria Novella, and in the History of Giovanni Villani\r\nlikewise; and I have not wished to withhold these few facts regarding\r\nthis church and convent, both because it is one of the most important\r\nand most beautiful churches in Florence, and also because they have\r\ntherein, as will be said below, many excellent works made by the most\r\nfamous craftsmen that have lived in the years past.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The literal meaning of tramezzo is \"something that acts as\r\na partition between one thing and another.\" There are cases where it\r\nmight be translated \"rood-screen\"; but in general it may be taken to\r\nmean transept, which may be said to divide a church into two parts. In\r\nall cases where the word occurs, reference will be made to this note.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGARITONE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF MARGARITONE,\r\n\r\nPAINTER, SCULPTOR, AND ARCHITECT, OF AREZZO\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the old painters who were much alarmed by the praises rightly\r\ngiven by men to Cimabue and to his disciple Giotto, whose good work in\r\npainting was making their glory shine throughout all Italy, was one\r\nMargaritone, painter of Arezzo, who, with the others who in that unhappy\r\ncentury were holding the highest rank in painting, recognized that their\r\nworks were little less than wholly obscuring his own fame. Margaritone,\r\nthen, being held excellent among the other painters of these times who\r\nwere working after the Greek manner, wrought many panels in distemper at\r\nArezzo, and he painted in fresco--in even more pictures, but in a long\r\ntime and with much fatigue--almost the whole Church of S. Clemente,\r\nAbbey of the Order of Camaldoli, which is to-day all in ruins and thrown\r\ndown, together with many other buildings and a strong fortress called S.\r\nChimenti, for the reason that Duke Cosimo de' Medici, not only on that\r\nspot but right round that city, pulled down many buildings and the old\r\nwalls (which were restored by Guido Pietramalesco, formerly Bishop and\r\nPatron of that city); in order to rebuild the latter with connecting\r\nwings and bastions, much stronger and smaller than they were, and in\r\nconsequence more easy to guard and with few men. There were, in the said\r\npictures, many figures both small and great, and although they were\r\nwrought after the Greek manner, it was recognized, none the less, that\r\nthey had been made with good judgment and lovingly; to which witness is\r\nborne by works by the same man's hand which have survived in that city,\r\nand above all a panel that is now in S. Francesco, in the Chapel of the\r\nConception, with a modern frame, wherein is a Madonna held by these\r\nfriars in great veneration. He made in the same church, also after the\r\nGreek manner, a great Crucifix which is now placed in that chapel where\r\nthere is the Office of the Wardens of Works; this is wrought on the\r\nplanking, with the Cross outlined, and of this sort he made many in that\r\ncity. For the Nuns of S. Margherita he wrought a work that is to-day set\r\nup against the tramezzo[9] of the church--namely, a canvas fixed on a\r\npanel, wherein are scenes with small figures from the life of Our Lady\r\nand of S. John the Baptist, in considerably better manner than the\r\nlarge, and executed with more diligence and grace. This work is notable,\r\nnot only because the said small figures are so well made that they look\r\nlike miniatures, but also because it is a marvel to see that a work on\r\ncanvas has been preserved for three hundred years. He made throughout\r\nthe whole city an infinity of pictures, and at Sargiano, a convent of\r\nthe Frati de' Zoccoli, a S. Francis portrayed from nature on a panel,\r\nwhereon he placed his name, as on a work, in his judgment, wrought\r\nbetter than was his wont. Next, having made a large Crucifix on wood,\r\npainted after the Greek manner, he sent it to Florence to Messer\r\nFarinata degli Uberti, a most famous citizen, for the reason that he\r\nhad, among other noble deeds, freed his country from imminent ruin and\r\nperil. This Crucifix is to-day in S. Croce, between the Chapel of the\r\nPeruzzi and that of the Giugni. In S. Domenico in Arezzo, a church and\r\nconvent built by the Lords of Pietramala in the year 1275, as their arms\r\nstill prove, he wrought many works, and then returned to Rome (where he\r\nhad already been held very dear by Pope Urban IV), to the end that he\r\nmight do certain works in fresco at his commission in the portico of S.\r\nPietro; these were in the Greek manner, and passing good for those\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mansell_\r\n\r\nTHE VIRGIN AND CHILD, WITH SCENES FROM THE LIVES OF THE SAINTS\r\n\r\n(_After the painting by_ Margaritone. _London: National Gallery, 5040_)]\r\n\r\nNext, having made a S. Francis on a panel at Ganghereto, a place above\r\nTerra Nuova in Valdarno, his spirit grew exalted and he gave himself to\r\nsculpture, and that with so much zeal that he succeeded much better than\r\nhe had done in painting, because, although his first sculptures were in\r\nGreek manner, as four wooden figures show that are in a Deposition from\r\nthe Cross in the Prieve, and some other figures in the round placed in\r\nthe Chapel of S. Francesco over the baptismal font, none the less he\r\nadopted a better manner after he had seen in Florence the works of\r\nArnolfo and of the other then most famous sculptors. Wherefore, having\r\nreturned to Arezzo in the year 1275, in the wake of the Court of Pope\r\nGregory, who passed through Florence on his return from Avignon to Rome,\r\nthere came to him opportunity to make himself more known, for the reason\r\nthat this Pope died in Arezzo, after having presented thirty thousand\r\ncrowns to the Commune to the end that there might be finished the\r\nbuilding of the Vescovado, formerly begun by Maestro Lapo and little\r\nadvanced, and the Aretines, besides making the Chapel of S. Gregorio\r\n(where Margaritone afterwards made a panel) in the Vescovado, in memory\r\nof the said Pontiff, also ordained that a tomb of marble should be made\r\nfor him by the same man in the said Vescovado. Putting his hand to the\r\nwork, he brought it to completion, including therein the portrait of the\r\nPope from nature, done both in marble and in painting, in a manner that\r\nit was held the best work that he had ever yet made. Next, work being\r\nresumed on the building of the Vescovado, Margaritone carried it very\r\nfar on, following the design of Lapo; but he did not, however, deliver\r\nit finished, because a few years later, in the year 1289, the wars\r\nbetween the Florentines and the Aretines were renewed, by the fault of\r\nGuglielmino Ubertini, Bishop and Lord of Arezzo, assisted by the Tarlati\r\nda Pietramala and by the Pazzi di Valdarno, although evil came to them\r\nthereby, for they were routed and slain at Campaldino; and there was\r\nspent in that war all the money left by the Pope for the building of the\r\nVescovado. And therefore the Aretines ordained that in place of this\r\nthere should serve the impost paid by the district (thus do they call a\r\ntax), as a particular revenue for that work; which impost has lasted up\r\nto our own day, and continues to last.\r\n\r\nNow returning to Margaritone: from what is seen in his works, as regards\r\npainting, he was the first who considered what a man must do when he\r\nworks on panels of wood, to the end that they may stay firm in the\r\njoinings, and that they may not show fissures and cracks opening out\r\nafter they have been painted; for he was used to put over the whole\r\nsurface of the panels a canvas of linen cloth, attached with a strong\r\nglue made from shreds of parchment and boiled over a fire; and then\r\nover the said canvas he spread gesso, as is seen in many panels by him\r\nand by others. He wrought, besides, on gesso mingled with the same glue,\r\nfriezes and diadems in relief and other ornaments in the round; and he\r\nwas the inventor of the method of applying Armenian bole, and of\r\nspreading gold-leaf thereon and burnishing it. All these things, never\r\nseen before, are seen in many of his works, and in particular in the\r\nPieve of Arezzo, in an altar-front wherein are stories of S. Donatus,\r\nand in S. Agnesa and S. Niccolo in the same city.\r\n\r\nFinally, he wrought many works in his own country, which went abroad;\r\nsome of which are at Rome, in S. Giovanni and in S. Pietro, and some at\r\nPisa, in S. Caterina, where, in the tramezzo[10] of the church, there is\r\nset up over an altar a panel with S. Catherine on it, and many scenes\r\nfrom her life with little figures, and a S. Francis with many scenes on\r\na panel, on a ground of gold. And in the upper Church of S. Francesco\r\nd'Assisi there is a Crucifix by his hand, painted in the Greek manner,\r\non a beam that crosses the church. All which works were in great esteem\r\namong the people of that age, although to-day by us they are not\r\nesteemed save as old things, good when art was not, as it is to-day, at\r\nits height. And seeing that Margaritone applied himself also to\r\narchitecture, although I have not made mention of any buildings made\r\nwith his design, because they are not of importance, I will yet not\r\nforbear to say that he, according to what I find, made the design and\r\nmodel of the Palazzo de' Governatori in the city of Ancona, after the\r\nGreek manner, in the year 1270; and what is more, he made in sculpture,\r\non the principal front, eight windows, whereof each one has, in the\r\nspace in the middle, two columns that support in the middle two arches,\r\nover which each window has a scene in half-relief that reaches from the\r\nsaid small arches up to the top of the window; a scene, I say, from the\r\nOld Testament, carved in a kind of stone that is found in that district.\r\nUnder the said windows, on the facade, there are certain words that are\r\nunderstood rather at discretion than because they are either in good\r\nform or rightly written, wherein there is read the date and in whose\r\ntime this work was made. By the hand of the same man, also, was the\r\ndesign of the Church of S. Ciriaco in Ancona. Margaritone died at the\r\nage of seventy-seven, disgusted, so it is said, to have lived so long,\r\nseeing the age changed and the honours with the new craftsmen. He was\r\nburied in the Duomo Vecchio without Arezzo, in a tomb of travertine, now\r\ngone to ruin in the destruction of that church; and there was made for\r\nhim this epitaph:\r\n\r\n     HIC JACET ILLE BONUS PICTURA MARGARITONUS,\r\n     CUI REQUIEM DOMINUS TRADAT UBIQUE PIUS.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Margaritone, by the hand of Spinello, is in the Story of\r\nthe Magi, in the said Duomo, and was copied by me before that church was\r\npulled down.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: See note on p. 57.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: See note on p. 57.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGIOTTO\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anderson_\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH OF S. FRANCIS\r\n\r\n(_After the fresco by_ Giotto. _Florence: S. Croce_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF GIOTTO,\r\n\r\nPAINTER, SCULPTOR, AND ARCHITECT, OF FLORENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThat very obligation which the craftsmen of painting owe to nature, who\r\nserves continually as model to those who are ever wresting the good from\r\nher best and most beautiful features and striving to counterfeit and to\r\nimitate her, should be owed, in my belief, to Giotto, painter of\r\nFlorence, for the reason that, after the methods of good paintings and\r\ntheir outlines had lain buried for so many years under the ruins of the\r\nwars, he alone, although born among inept craftsmen, by the gift of God\r\nrevived that art, which had come to a grievous pass, and brought it to\r\nsuch a form as could be called good. And truly it was a very great\r\nmiracle that that age, gross and inept, should have had strength to work\r\nin Giotto in a fashion so masterly, that design, whereof the men of\r\nthose times had little or no knowledge, was restored completely to life\r\nby means of him. And yet this great man was born at the village of\r\nVespignano, in the district of Florence, fourteen miles distant from\r\nthat city, in the year 1276, from a father named Bondone, a tiller of\r\nthe soil and a simple fellow. He, having had this son, to whom he gave\r\nthe name Giotto, reared him conformably to his condition; and when he\r\nhad come to the age of ten, he showed in all his actions, although\r\nchildish still, a vivacity and readiness of intelligence much out of the\r\nordinary, which rendered him dear not only to his father but to all\r\nthose also who knew him, both in the village and beyond. Now Bondone\r\ngave some sheep into his charge, and he, going about the holding, now in\r\none part and now in another, to graze them, and impelled by a natural\r\ninclination to the art of design, was for ever drawing, on stones, on\r\nthe ground, or on sand, something from nature, or in truth anything\r\nthat came into his fancy. Wherefore Cimabue, going one day on some\r\nbusiness of his own from Florence to Vespignano, found Giotto, while his\r\nsheep were browsing, portraying a sheep from nature on a flat and\r\npolished slab, with a stone slightly pointed, without having learnt any\r\nmethod of doing this from others, but only from nature; whence Cimabue,\r\nstanding fast all in a marvel, asked him if he wished to go to live with\r\nhim. The child answered that, his father consenting, he would go\r\nwillingly. Cimabue then asking this from Bondone, the latter lovingly\r\ngranted it to him, and was content that he should take the boy with him\r\nto Florence; whither having come, in a short time, assisted by nature\r\nand taught by Cimabue, the child not only equalled the manner of his\r\nmaster, but became so good an imitator of nature that he banished\r\ncompletely that rude Greek manner and revived the modern and good art of\r\npainting, introducing the portraying well from nature of living people,\r\nwhich had not been used for more than two hundred years. If, indeed,\r\nanyone had tried it, as has been said above, he had not succeeded very\r\nhappily, nor as well by a great measure as Giotto, who portrayed among\r\nothers, as is still seen to-day in the Chapel of the Palace of the\r\nPodesta at Florence, Dante Alighieri, a contemporary and his very great\r\nfriend, and no less famous as poet than was in the same times Giotto as\r\npainter, so much praised by Messer Giovanni Boccaccio in the preface to\r\nthe story of Messer Forese da Rabatta and of Giotto the painter himself.\r\nIn the same chapel are the portraits, likewise by the same man's hand,\r\nof Ser Brunetto Latini, master of Dante, and of Messer Corso Donati, a\r\ngreat citizen of those times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anderson_\r\n\r\nS. FRANCIS PREACHING BEFORE POPE HONORIUS III\r\n\r\n(_After the fresco of the_ Roman School. _Assisi: Upper Church of S.\r\nFrancesco_)]\r\n\r\nThe first pictures of Giotto were in the chapel of the high-altar in the\r\nBadia of Florence, wherein he made many works held beautiful, but in\r\nparticular a Madonna receiving the Annunciation, for the reason that in\r\nher he expressed vividly the fear and the terror that the salutation of\r\nGabriel inspired in Mary the Virgin, who appears, all full of the\r\ngreatest alarm, to be wishing almost to turn to flight. By the hand of\r\nGiotto, likewise, is the panel on the high-altar of the said chapel,\r\nwhich has been preserved there to our own day, and is still preserved\r\nthere, more because of a certain reverence that is felt for the work of\r\nso great a man than for any other reason. And in S. Croce there are\r\nfour chapels by the same man's hand: three between the sacristy and the\r\ngreat chapel, and one on the other side. In the first of the three,\r\nwhich is that of Messer Ridolfo de' Bardi, and is that wherein are the\r\nbell-ropes, is the life of S. Francis, in the death of whom a good\r\nnumber of friars show very naturally the expression of weeping. In the\r\nnext, which is that of the family of Peruzzi, are two stories of the\r\nlife of S. John the Baptist, to whom the chapel is dedicated; wherein\r\ngreat vivacity is seen in the dancing and leaping of Herodias, and in\r\nthe promptness of some servants bustling at the service of the table. In\r\nthe same are two marvellous stories of S. John the Evangelist--namely,\r\nwhen he brings Drusiana back to life, and when he is carried off into\r\nHeaven. In the third, which is that of the Giugni, dedicated to the\r\nApostles, there are painted by the hand of Giotto the stories of the\r\nmartyrdom of many of them. In the fourth, which is on the other side of\r\nthe church, towards the north, and belongs to the Tosinghi and to the\r\nSpinelli, and is dedicated to the Assumption of Our Lady, Giotto painted\r\nher Birth, her Marriage, her Annunciation, the Adoration of the Magi,\r\nand when she presents Christ as a little Child to Simeon, which is\r\nsomething very beautiful, seeing that, besides a great affection that is\r\nseen in that old man as he receives Christ, the action of the child,\r\nstretching out its arms in fear of him and turning in terror towards its\r\nmother, could not be more touching or more beautiful. Next, in the death\r\nof the Madonna herself, there are the Apostles, and a good number of\r\nangels with torches in their hands, all very beautiful. In the Chapel of\r\nthe Baroncelli, in the said church, is a panel in distemper by the hand\r\nof Giotto, wherein is executed with much diligence the Coronation of Our\r\nLady, with a very great number of little figures and a choir of angels\r\nand saints, very diligently wrought. And because in that work there are\r\nwritten his name and the date in letters of gold, craftsmen who will\r\nconsider at what time Giotto, with no glimmer of the good manner, gave a\r\nbeginning to the good method of drawing and of colouring, will be forced\r\nto hold him in the highest veneration. In the same Church of S. Croce,\r\nover the marble tomb of Carlo Marsuppini of Arezzo, there is a Crucifix,\r\nwith the Madonna, S. John, and Magdalene at the foot of the Cross; and\r\non the other side of the church, exactly opposite this, over the\r\nburial-place of Lionardo Aretino, facing the high-altar, there is an\r\nAnnunciation, which has been recoloured by modern painters, with small\r\njudgment on the part of him who has had this done. In the refectory, on\r\na Tree of the Cross, are stories of S. Louis and a Last Supper by the\r\nsame man's hand; and on the wardrobes in the sacristy are scenes with\r\nlittle figures from the life of Christ and of S. Francis. He wrought,\r\nalso, in the Church of the Carmine, in the Chapel of S. Giovanni\r\nBattista, all the life of that Saint, divided into a number of pictures;\r\nand in the Palace of the Guelph party, in Florence, there is a story of\r\nthe Christian Faith, painted perfectly in fresco by his hand; and\r\ntherein is the portrait of Pope Clement IV, who created that magisterial\r\nbody, giving it his arms, which it has always held and holds still.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anderson_\r\n\r\nTHE BODY OF S. FRANCIS BEFORE THE CHURCH OF S. DAMIANO\r\n\r\n(_After the fresco of the_ Roman School. _Assisi: Upper Church of S.\r\nFrancesco_)]\r\n\r\nAfter these works, departing from Florence in order to go to finish in\r\nAssisi the works begun by Cimabue, in passing through Arezzo he painted\r\nin the Pieve the Chapel of S. Francesco, which is above the place of\r\nbaptism; and on a round column, near a Corinthian capital that is both\r\nancient and very beautiful, he portrayed from nature a S. Francis and a\r\nS. Dominic; and in the Duomo without Arezzo he painted the Stoning of S.\r\nStephen in a little chapel, with a beautiful composition of figures.\r\nThese works finished, he betook himself to Assisi, a city of Umbria,\r\nbeing called thither by Fra Giovanni di Muro della Marca, then General\r\nof the Friars of S. Francis; where, in the upper church, he painted in\r\nfresco, under the gallery that crosses the windows, on both sides of the\r\nchurch, thirty-two scenes of the life and acts of S. Francis--that is,\r\nsixteen on each wall--so perfectly that he acquired thereby very great\r\nfame. And in truth there is seen great variety in that work, not only in\r\nthe gestures and attitudes of each figure but also in the composition of\r\nall the scenes; not to mention that it enables us very beautifully to\r\nsee the diversity of the costumes of those times, and certain imitations\r\nand observations of the things of nature. Among others, there is one\r\nvery beautiful scene, wherein a thirsty man, in whom the desire for\r\nwater is vividly seen, is drinking, bending down on the ground by a\r\nfountain with very great and truly marvellous expression, in a manner\r\nthat it seems almost a living person that is drinking. There are also\r\nmany other things there most worthy of consideration, about which, in\r\norder not to be tedious, I do not enlarge further. Let it suffice that\r\nthis whole work acquired for Giotto very great fame, by reason of the\r\nexcellence of the figures and of the order, proportion, liveliness, and\r\nfacility which he had from nature, and which he had made much greater by\r\nmeans of study, and was able to demonstrate clearly in all his works.\r\nAnd because, besides that which Giotto had from nature, he was most\r\ndiligent and went on ever thinking out new ideas and wresting them from\r\nnature, he well deserved to be called the disciple of nature and not of\r\nothers. The aforesaid scenes being finished, he painted in the same\r\nplace, but in the lower church, the upper part of the walls at the sides\r\nof the high-altar, and all the four angles of the vaulting above in the\r\nplace where lies the body of S. Francis; and all with inventions both\r\nfanciful and beautiful. In the first is S. Francis glorified in Heaven,\r\nsurrounded by those virtues which are essential for him who wishes to be\r\nperfectly in the grace of God. On one side Obedience is placing a yoke\r\non the neck of a friar who is before her on his knees, and the bands of\r\nthe yoke are drawn by certain hands towards Heaven; and, enjoining\r\nsilence with one finger to her lips, she has her eyes on Jesus Christ,\r\nwho is shedding blood from His side. And in company with this virtue are\r\nPrudence and Humility, in order to show that where there is true\r\nobedience there are ever humility and prudence, which enable us to carry\r\nout every action well. In the second angle is Chastity, who, standing in\r\na very strong fastness, is refusing to be conquered either by kingdoms\r\nor crowns or palms that some are presenting to her. At her feet is\r\nPurity, who is washing naked figures; and Force is busy leading people\r\nto wash and purify themselves. Near to Chastity, on one side, is\r\nPenitence, who is chasing Love away with a Discipline, and putting to\r\nflight Impurity. In the third space is Poverty, who is walking with bare\r\nfeet on thorns, and has a dog that is barking at her from behind, and\r\nabout her a boy who is throwing stones at her, and another who is busy\r\npushing some thorns with a stick against her legs. And this Poverty is\r\nseen here being espoused by S. Francis, while Jesus Christ is holding\r\nher hand, there being present, not without mystic meaning, Hope and\r\nCompassion. In the fourth and last of the said spaces is a S. Francis,\r\nalso glorified, in the white tunic of a deacon, and shown triumphant in\r\nHeaven in the midst of a multitude of angels who are forming a choir\r\nround him, with a standard whereon is a Cross with seven stars; and on\r\nhigh is the Holy Spirit. Within each of these angles are some Latin\r\nwords that explain the scenes. In like manner, besides the said four\r\nangles, there are pictures on the side walls which are very beautiful\r\nand truly to be held in great price, both by reason of the perfection\r\nthat is seen in them and because they were wrought with so great\r\ndiligence that up to our own day they have remained fresh. In these\r\npictures is the portrait of Giotto himself, very well made, and over the\r\ndoor of the sacristy, by the same man's hand and also in fresco, there\r\nis a S. Francis who is receiving the Stigmata, so loving and devout that\r\nto me it appears the most excellent picture that Giotto made in these\r\nworks, which are all truly beautiful and worthy of praise.\r\n\r\nHaving finished, then, for the last, the said S. Francis, he returned to\r\nFlorence, where, on arriving there, he painted, on a panel that was to\r\nbe sent to Pisa, a S. Francis on the tremendous rock of La Vernia, with\r\nextraordinary diligence, seeing that, besides certain landscapes full of\r\ntrees and cliffs, which was something new in those times, there are seen\r\nin the attitude of a S. Francis, who is kneeling and receiving the\r\nStigmata with much readiness, a most ardent desire to receive them and\r\ninfinite love towards Jesus Christ, who, being surrounded in the sky by\r\nseraphim, is granting them to him with an expression so vivid that\r\nanything better cannot be imagined. In the lower part of the same panel\r\nthere are three very beautiful scenes of the life of the same Saint.\r\nThis panel, which to-day is seen in S. Francesco in Pisa on a pillar\r\nbeside the high-altar, and is held in great veneration as a memorial of\r\nso great a man, was the reason that the Pisans, having just finished the\r\nbuilding of the Campo Santo after the design of Giovanni, son of Niccola\r\nPisano, as has been said above, gave to Giotto the painting of part of\r\nthe inner walls, to the end that, since this so great fabric was all\r\nincrusted on the outer side with marbles and with carvings made at very\r\ngreat cost, and roofed over with lead, and also full of sarcophagi and\r\nancient tombs once belonging to the heathens and brought to Pisa from\r\nvarious parts of the world, even so it might be adorned within, on the\r\nwalls, with the noblest painting. Having gone to Pisa, then, for this\r\npurpose, Giotto made in fresco, on the first part of a wall in that\r\nCampo Santo, six large stories of the most patient Job. And because he\r\njudiciously reflected that the marbles of that part of the building\r\nwhere he had to work were turned towards the sea, and that, all being\r\nsaline marbles, they are ever damp by reason of the south-east winds and\r\nthrow out a certain salt moisture, even as the bricks of Pisa do for the\r\nmost part, and that therefore the colours and the paintings fade and\r\ncorrode, he caused to be made over the whole surface where he wished to\r\nwork in fresco, to the end that his work might be preserved as long as\r\npossible, a coating, or in truth an intonaco or incrustation--that is to\r\nsay, with lime, gypsum, and powdered brick all mixed together; so\r\nsuitably that the pictures which he afterwards made thereon have been\r\npreserved up to the present day. And they would be still better if the\r\nnegligence of those who should have taken care of them had not allowed\r\nthem to be much injured by the damp, because the fact that this was not\r\nprovided for, as was easily possible, has been the reason that these\r\npictures, having suffered from damp, have been spoilt in certain places,\r\nand the flesh-colours have been blackened, and the intonaco has peeled\r\noff; not to mention that the nature of gypsum, when it has been mixed\r\nwith lime, is to corrode in time and to grow rotten, whence it arises\r\nthat afterwards, perforce, it spoils the colours, although it appears at\r\nthe beginning to take a good and firm hold. In these scenes, besides the\r\nportrait of Messer Farinata degli Uberti, there are many beautiful\r\nfigures, and above all certain villagers, who, in carrying the grievous\r\nnews to Job, could not be more full of feeling nor show better than they\r\ndo the grief that they felt over the lost cattle and over the other\r\nmisadventures. Likewise there is amazing grace in the figure of a\r\nman-servant who is standing with a fan beside Job, who is covered with\r\nulcers and almost abandoned by all; and although he is well done in\r\nevery part, he is marvellous in the attitude that he strikes in chasing\r\nthe flies from his leprous and stinking master with one hand, while with\r\nthe other he is holding his nose in disgust, in order not to notice the\r\nstench. In like manner, the other figures in these scenes and the heads\r\nboth of the males and of the women are very beautiful; and the draperies\r\nare wrought to such a degree of softness that it is no marvel if this\r\nwork acquired for him so great fame, both in that city and abroad, that\r\nPope Benedict IX of Treviso sent one of his courtiers into Tuscany to\r\nsee what sort of man was Giotto, and of what kind his works, having\r\ndesigned to have some pictures made in S. Pietro. This courtier, coming\r\nin order to see Giotto and to hear what other masters there were in\r\nFlorence excellent in painting and in mosaic, talked to many masters in\r\nSiena. Then, having received drawings from them, he came to Florence,\r\nand having gone into the shop of Giotto, who was working, declared to\r\nhim the mind of the Pope and in what way it was proposed to make use of\r\nhis labour, and at last asked him for some little drawing, to the end\r\nthat he might send it to His Holiness. Giotto, who was most courteous,\r\ntook a paper, and on that, with a brush dipped in red, holding his arm\r\nfast against his side in order to make a compass, with a turn of the\r\nhand he made a circle, so true in proportion and circumference that to\r\nbehold it was a marvel. This done, he smiled and said to the courtier:\r\n\"Here is your drawing.\" He, thinking he was being derided, said: \"Am I\r\nto have no other drawing but this?\" \"'Tis enough and to spare,\" answered\r\nGiotto. \"Send it, together with the others, and you will see if it will\r\nbe recognized.\" The envoy, seeing that he could get nothing else, left\r\nhim, very ill-satisfied and doubting that he had been fooled. All the\r\nsame, sending to the Pope the other drawings and the names of those who\r\nhad made them, he also sent that of Giotto, relating the method that he\r\nhad followed in making his circle without moving his arm and without\r\ncompasses. Wherefore the Pope and many courtiers that were versed in the\r\narts recognized by this how much Giotto surpassed in excellence all the\r\nother painters of his time. This matter having afterwards spread abroad,\r\nthere was born from it the proverb that is still wont to be said to men\r\nof gross wits: \"Tu sei piu tondo che l' O di Giotto!\" (\"Thou art\r\nrounder than Giotto's circle\"). This proverb can be called beautiful not\r\nonly from the occasion that gave it birth, but also for its\r\nsignificance, which consists in the double meaning; tondo being used, in\r\nTuscany, both for the perfect shape of a circle and for slowness and\r\ngrossness of understanding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anderson_\r\n\r\nTHE RAISING OF LAZARUS\r\n\r\n(_After the fresco by_ Giotto and his Pupils. _Assisi: Lower Church of\r\nS. Francesco_)]\r\n\r\nThe aforesaid Pope then made him come to Rome, where, honouring him much\r\nand appreciating his talents, he made him paint five scenes from the\r\nlife of Christ in the apse of S. Pietro, and the chief panel in the\r\nsacristy, which were all executed by him with so great diligence that\r\nthere never issued from his hands any more finished work in distemper.\r\nWherefore he well deserved that the Pope, holding himself to have been\r\nwell served, should cause to be given to him six hundred ducats of gold,\r\nbesides granting him so many favours that they were talked of throughout\r\nall Italy.\r\n\r\nAbout this time--in order to withhold nothing worthy of remembrance in\r\nconnection with art--there was in Rome one Oderigi d'Agobbio, who was\r\nmuch the friend of Giotto and an excellent illuminator for those days.\r\nThis man, being summoned for this purpose by the Pope, illuminated many\r\nbooks for the library of the palace, which are now in great part eaten\r\naway by time. And in my book of ancient drawings are some remains from\r\nthe very hand of this man, who in truth was an able man; although a much\r\nbetter master than Oderigi was Franco Bolognese, who wrought a number of\r\nworks excellently in that manner for the same Pope and for the same\r\nlibrary, about the same time, as can be seen in the said book, wherein I\r\nhave designs by his hand both in painting and in illumination, and among\r\nthem an eagle very well done, and a very beautiful lion that is tearing\r\na tree. Of these two excellent illuminators Dante makes mention in the\r\neleventh canto of the _Purgatorio_, where he is talking of the\r\nvainglorious, in these verses:\r\n\r\n     O, dissi a lui, non se' tu Oderigi,\r\n     L'onor d'Agobbio, e l'onor di quell'arte\r\n     Che alluminare e chiamata in Parigi?\r\n     Frate, diss'egli, piu ridon le carte\r\n     Che pennelleggia Franco Bolognese;\r\n     L'onor e tutto suo, e mio in parte.\r\n\r\nThe Pope, having seen these works, and the manner of Giotto pleasing him\r\ninfinitely, ordered him to make scenes from the Old Testament and the\r\nNew right round S. Pietro; wherefore, for a beginning, Giotto made in\r\nfresco the Angel that is over the organ, seven braccia high, and many\r\nother paintings, whereof part have been restored by others in our own\r\ndays, and part, in founding the new walls, have been either destroyed or\r\nremoved from the old edifice of S. Pietro, up to the space below the\r\norgan; such as a Madonna on a wall, which, to the end that it might not\r\nbe thrown to the ground, was cut right out of the wall and made fast\r\nwith beams and iron bars and thus removed, and afterwards built in, by\r\nreason of its beauty, in the place that pleased the pious love that is\r\nborne towards everything excellent in art by Messer Niccolo Acciaiuoli,\r\ndoctor of Florence, who richly adorned this work of Giotto with\r\nstucco-work and also with modern paintings. By his hand, also, was the\r\nNavicella in mosaic that is over the three doors of the portico in the\r\ncourt of S. Pietro, which is truly marvellous and deservedly praised by\r\nall beautiful minds, because in it, besides the design, there is the\r\ngrouping of the Apostles, who are travailing in diverse manners through\r\nthe sea-tempest, while the winds are blowing into a sail, which has so\r\nhigh a relief that a real one would not have more; and moreover it is\r\ndifficult to have to make with those pieces of glass a unity such as\r\nthat which is seen in the lights and shadows of so great a sail, which\r\ncould only be equalled by the brush with great difficulty and by making\r\nevery possible effort; not to mention that in a fisherman, who is\r\nfishing from a rock with a line, there is seen an attitude of extreme\r\npatience proper to that art, and in his face the hope and the wish to\r\nmake a catch. Under this work are three little arches in fresco, of\r\nwhich, since they are for the greater part spoilt, I will say no more.\r\nThe praises universally given by craftsmen to this work are well\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\nGiotto, having afterwards painted on a panel a large Crucifix coloured\r\nin distemper, for the Minerva, a church of the Preaching Friars,\r\nreturned to his own country, having been abroad six years. But no long\r\ntime after, by reason of the death of Pope Benedict IX, Clement V was\r\ncreated Pope in Perugia, and Giotto was forced to betake himself with\r\nthat Pope to the place where he brought his Court, to Avignon, in order\r\nto do certain works there; and having gone there, he made, not only in\r\nAvignon but in many other places in France, many very beautiful panels\r\nand pictures in fresco, which pleased the Pontiff and the whole Court\r\ninfinitely. Wherefore, the work dispatched, the Pope dismissed him\r\nlovingly and with many gifts, and he returned home no less rich than\r\nhonoured and famous; and among the rest he brought back the portrait of\r\nthat Pope, which he gave afterwards to Taddeo Gaddi, his disciple. And\r\nthis return of Giotto to Florence was in the year 1316. But it was not\r\ngranted to him to stay long in Florence, because, being summoned to\r\nPadua by the agency of the Signori della Scala, he painted a very\r\nbeautiful chapel in the Santo, a church built in those times. From there\r\nhe went to Verona, where, for Messer Cane, he made certain pictures in\r\nhis palace, and in particular the portrait of that lord; and a panel for\r\nthe Friars of S. Francis. These works completed, in returning to Tuscany\r\nhe was forced to stay in Ferrara, and he painted at the behest of those\r\nSignori d'Este, in their palace and in S. Agostino, some works that are\r\nstill seen there to-day. Meanwhile, it coming to the ears of Dante, poet\r\nof Florence, that Giotto was in Ferrara, he so contrived that he brought\r\nhim to Ravenna, where he was living in exile; and he caused him to make\r\nround the Church of S. Francesco, for the Signori da Polenta, some\r\nscenes in fresco that are passing good. Next, having gone from Ravenna\r\nto Urbino, there too he wrought some works. Then, chancing to pass\r\nthrough Arezzo, he could not but comply with the wish of Piero Saccone,\r\nwho had been much his friend; wherefore he made for him in fresco, on a\r\npillar in the principal chapel of the Vescovado, a S. Martin who has cut\r\nhis cloak in half and is giving one part of it to a beggar, who is\r\nstanding before him almost wholly naked. Then, having made for the Abbey\r\nof S. Fiore a large Crucifix painted in distemper on wood, which is\r\nto-day in the middle of that church, he returned finally to Florence,\r\nwhere, among many other works, he made some pictures in the Convent of\r\nthe Nuns of Faenza, both in fresco and in distemper, that are not in\r\nexistence to-day, by reason of the destruction of that convent. In the\r\nyear 1322, likewise--Dante, very much his friend, having died in the\r\nyear before, to his great sorrow--he went to Lucca, and at the request\r\nof Castruccio, then Lord of that city, his birthplace, he made a panel\r\nin S. Martino with a Christ in air and four Saints, Protectors of that\r\ncity--namely, S. Peter, S. Regulus, S. Martin, and S. Paulinus--who\r\nappear to be recommending a Pope and an Emperor, who, according to what\r\nis believed by many, are Frederick of Bavaria and the Anti-Pope Nicholas\r\nV. Some, likewise, believe that Giotto designed the castle and fortress\r\nof Giusta, which is impregnable, at San Frediano, in the same city of\r\nLucca.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, Giotto having returned to Florence, Robert, King of Naples,\r\nwrote to Charles, King of Calabria, his first-born son, who chanced to\r\nbe in Florence, that he should send him Giotto to Naples at all costs,\r\nfor the reason that, having finished the building of S. Chiara, a\r\nconvent of nuns and a royal church, he wished that it should be adorned\r\nby him with noble paintings. Giotto, then, hearing himself summoned by a\r\nKing so greatly renowned and famous, went more than willingly to serve\r\nhim, and, on arriving, painted many scenes from the Old Testament and\r\nthe New in some chapels of the said convent. And the scenes from the\r\nApocalypse that he made in one of the said chapels are said to have been\r\ninventions of Dante; and this may be also true of those at Assisi, so\r\ngreatly renowned, whereof there has been enough said above. And although\r\nDante at that time was dead, they may have held discourse on these\r\nmatters, as often comes to pass between friends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIOTTO: MADONNA AND CHILD\r\n\r\n(_Florence: Accademia 103. Panel_)]\r\n\r\nBut to return to Naples; Giotto made many works in the Castel dell'Uovo,\r\nand in particular the chapel, which much pleased that King, by whom he\r\nwas so greatly beloved that many times, while working, Giotto found\r\nhimself entertained by the King in person, who took pleasure in seeing\r\nhim at work and in hearing his discourse. And Giotto, who had ever some\r\njest on his tongue and some witty repartee in readiness, would entertain\r\nhim with his hand, in painting, and with pleasant discourse, in his\r\njesting. Wherefore, the King saying to him one day that he wished to\r\nmake him the first man in Naples, Giotto answered, \"And for that end\r\nam I lodged at the Porta Reale, in order to be the first in Naples.\"\r\nAnother time, the King saying to him, \"Giotto, an I were you, now that\r\nit is hot, I would give over painting for a little;\" he answered, \"And\r\nI, i' faith, an I were you.\" Being then very dear to the King, he made\r\nfor him a good number of pictures in a hall (that King Alfonso I pulled\r\ndown in order to make the Castle), and also in the Incoronata; and among\r\nothers in the said hall were the portraits of many famous men, and among\r\nthem that of Giotto himself. Now the King having one day out of caprice\r\nbesought him to paint his realm for him, Giotto, so it is said, painted\r\nfor him an ass saddled, that had at its feet a new pack-saddle, and was\r\nsniffing at it and making semblance of desiring it; and on both the old\r\npack-saddle and the new one were the royal crown and the sceptre of\r\nsovereignty; wherefore Giotto, being asked by the King what such a\r\npicture signified, answered that such were his subjects and such the\r\nkingdom, wherein every day a new lord was desired.\r\n\r\nDeparting from Naples in order to go to Rome, Giotto stopped at Gaeta,\r\nwhere he was forced to paint some scenes from the Old Testament in the\r\nNunziata, which are now spoilt by time, but yet not so completely that\r\nthere may not be seen in them very well the portrait of Giotto himself,\r\nnear a large and very beautiful Crucifix. This work finished, not being\r\nable to refuse this to Signor Malatesta, he first occupied himself in\r\nhis service for some days in Rome, and afterwards he betook himself to\r\nRimini, of which city the said Malatesta was lord; and there, in the\r\nChurch of S. Francesco, he made very many pictures, which were\r\nafterwards thrown to the ground and destroyed by Gismondo, son of\r\nPandolfo Malatesta, who rebuilt the whole said church anew. In the\r\ncloisters of the said place, also, opposite to the wall of the church,\r\nhe painted in fresco the story of the Blessed Michelina, which was one\r\nof the most beautiful and excellent works that Giotto ever made, by\r\nreason of the many and beautiful ideas that he had in working thereon;\r\nfor besides the beauty of the draperies, and the grace and vivacity of\r\nthe heads, which are miraculous, there is a young woman therein as\r\nbeautiful as ever a woman can be, who, in order to clear herself from\r\nthe false charge of adultery, is taking oath over a book in a most\r\nwonderful attitude, holding her eyes fixed on those of her husband, who\r\nwas making her take the oath by reason of mistrust in a black son born\r\nfrom her, whom he could in no way bring himself to believe to be his.\r\nShe, even as the husband is showing disdain and distrust in his face, is\r\nmaking clear with the purity of her brow and of her eyes, to those who\r\nare most intently gazing on her, her innocence and simplicity, and the\r\nwrong that he is doing to her in making her take oath and in proclaiming\r\nher wrongly as a harlot.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, very great feeling was that which he expressed in a sick\r\nman stricken with certain sores, seeing that all the women who are round\r\nhim, overcome by the stench, are making certain grimaces of disgust, the\r\nmost gracious in the world. The foreshortenings, next, that are seen in\r\nanother picture among a quantity of beggars that he portrayed, are very\r\nworthy of praise and should be held in great price among craftsmen,\r\nbecause from them there came the first beginning and method of making\r\nthem, not to mention that it cannot be said that they are not passing\r\ngood for early work. But above everything else that is in this work,\r\nmost marvellous is the gesture that the aforesaid Blessed Michelina is\r\nmaking towards certain usurers, who are disbursing to her the money from\r\nthe sale of her possessions for giving to the poor, seeing that in her\r\nthere is shown contempt of money and of the other things of this earth,\r\nwhich appear to disgust her, and, in them, the personification of human\r\navarice and greed. Very beautiful, too, is the figure of one who, while\r\ncounting the money, appears to be making sign to the notary who is\r\nwriting, considering that, although he has his eyes on the notary, he is\r\nyet keeping his hands on the money, thus revealing his love of it, his\r\navarice, and his distrust. In like manner, the three figures that are\r\nupholding the garments of S. Francis in the sky, representing Obedience,\r\nPatience, and Poverty, are worthy of infinite praise, above all because\r\nthere is in the manner of the draperies a natural flow of folds that\r\ngives us to know that Giotto was born in order to give light to\r\npainting. Besides this, he portrayed Signor Malatesta on a ship in this\r\nwork, so naturally that he appears absolutely alive; and some mariners\r\nand other people, in their promptness, their expressions, and their\r\nattitudes--and particularly a figure that is speaking with some others\r\nand spits into the sea, putting one hand up to his face--give us to know\r\nthe excellence of Giotto. And certainly, among all the works of painting\r\nmade by this master, this may be said to be one of the best, for the\r\nreason that there is not one figure in so great a number that does not\r\nshow very great craftsmanship, and that is not placed in some\r\ncharacteristic attitude. And therefore it is no marvel that Signor\r\nMalatesta did not fail to reward him magnificently and to praise him.\r\n\r\nHaving finished his labours for that lord, he complied with the request\r\nof a Prior of Florence who was then at S. Cataldo d'Arimini, and made a\r\nS. Thomas Aquinas, reading to his friars, without the door of the\r\nchurch. Departing thence, he returned to Ravenna and painted a chapel in\r\nfresco in S. Giovanni Evangelista, which is much extolled. Having next\r\nreturned to Florence with very great honour and ample means, he painted\r\na Crucifix on wood and in distemper for S. Marco, larger than life and\r\non a ground of gold, which was placed on the right hand in the church.\r\nAnd he made another like it in S. Maria Novella, whereon Puccio Capanna,\r\nhis pupil, worked in company with him; and this is still to-day over the\r\nprincipal door, on the right as you enter the church, over the tomb of\r\nthe Gaddi. And in the same church, over the tramezzo,[11] he made a S.\r\nLouis for Paolo di Lotto Ardinghelli, and at the foot thereof the\r\nportrait of him and of his wife, from the life.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, in the year 1327, Guido Tarlati da Pietramala, Bishop and\r\nLord of Arezzo, died at Massa di Maremma in returning from Lucca, where\r\nhe had been to visit the Emperor, and after his body had been brought to\r\nArezzo and the most magnificent funeral honours had been paid to it,\r\nPiero Saccone and Dolfo da Pietramala, the brother of the Bishop,\r\ndetermined that there should be made for him a tomb in marble worthy of\r\nthe greatness of so notable a man, who had been a lord both spiritual\r\nand temporal, and head of the Ghibelline party in Tuscany. Wherefore,\r\nhaving written to Giotto that he should make the design of a tomb very\r\nrich and with all possible adornment, and having sent him the\r\nmeasurements, they prayed him afterwards that he should place at their\r\ndisposal the sculptor who was the most excellent, according to his\r\nopinion, of all that were in Italy, because they were relying wholly on\r\nhis judgment. Giotto, who was most courteous, made the design and sent\r\nit to them; and after this design, as will be told in the proper place,\r\nthe said tomb was made. And because the said Piero Saccone had infinite\r\nlove for the talent of this man, having taken Borgo a San Sepolcro no\r\nlong time after he had received the said design, he brought from there\r\nto Arezzo a panel with little figures by the hand of Giotto, which\r\nafterwards fell to pieces; and Baccio Gondi, nobleman of Florence, a\r\nlover of these noble arts and of every talent, being Commissary of\r\nArezzo, sought out the pieces of this panel with great diligence, and\r\nhaving found some brought them to Florence, where he holds them in great\r\nveneration, together with some other works that he has by the hand of\r\nthe same Giotto, who wrought so many that their number is almost beyond\r\nbelief. And not many years ago, chancing to be at the Hermitage of\r\nCamaldoli, where I have wrought many works for those reverend Fathers, I\r\nsaw in a cell, whither it had been brought by the Very Reverend Don\r\nAntonio da Pisa, then General of the Congregation of Camaldoli, a very\r\nbeautiful little Crucifix on a ground of gold, with the name of Giotto\r\nin his own hand; which Crucifix, according to what I hear from the\r\nReverend Don Silvano Razzi, monk of Camaldoli, is kept to-day in the\r\ncell of the Superior of the Monastery of the Angeli, as being a very\r\nrare work and by the hand of Giotto, in company with a most beautiful\r\nlittle picture by Raffaello da Urbino.\r\n\r\nFor the Frati Umiliati of Ognissanti in Florence, Giotto painted a\r\nchapel and four panels, in one of which there was the Madonna, with many\r\nangels round her and the Child in her arms, and a large Crucifix on\r\nwood, whereof Puccio Capanna took the design and wrought many of them\r\nafterwards throughout all Italy, having much practice in the manner of\r\nGiotto. In the tramezzo[12] of the said church, when this book of the\r\nLives of the Painters, Sculptors, and Architects was printed the first\r\ntime, there was a little panel in distemper painted by Giotto with\r\ninfinite diligence, wherein was the death of Our Lady, with the\r\nApostles round her and with a Christ who is receiving her soul into His\r\narms. This work was much praised by the craftsmen of painting, and in\r\nparticular by Michelagnolo Buonarroti, who declared, as was said another\r\ntime, that the quality of this painted story could not be more like to\r\nthe truth than it is. This little panel, I say, having come into notice\r\nfrom the time when the book of these Lives was first published, was\r\nafterwards carried off by someone unknown, who, perhaps out of love for\r\nart and out of piety, it seeming to him that it was little esteemed,\r\nbecame, as said our poet, impious. And truly it was a miracle in those\r\ntimes that Giotto had so great loveliness in his painting, considering,\r\nabove all, that he learnt the art in a certain measure without a master.\r\n\r\nAfter these works, in the year 1334, on July 9, he put his hand to the\r\nCampanile of S. Maria del Fiore, whereof the foundation was a platform\r\nof strong stone, in a pit sunk twenty braccia deep from which water and\r\ngravel had been removed; upon this platform he made a good mass of\r\nconcrete, that reached to the height of twelve braccia above the first\r\nfoundation, and the rest--namely, the other eight braccia--he caused to\r\nbe made of masonry. And at this beginning and foundation there\r\nofficiated the Bishop of the city, who, in the presence of all the\r\nclergy and all the magistrates, solemnly laid the first stone. This\r\nwork, then, being carried on with the said model, which was in the\r\nGerman manner that was in use in those times, Giotto designed all the\r\nscenes that were going into the ornamentation, and marked out the model\r\nwith white, black, and red colours in all those places wherein the\r\nmarbles and the friezes were to go, with much diligence. The circuit\r\nround the base was one hundred braccia--that is, twenty-five braccia for\r\neach side--and the height, one hundred and forty-four braccia. And if\r\nthat is true, and I hold it as of the truest, which Lorenzo di Cione\r\nGhiberti has left in writing, Giotto made not only the model of this\r\ncampanile, but also part of those scenes in marble wherein are the\r\nbeginnings of all the arts, in sculpture and in relief. And the said\r\nLorenzo declares that he saw models in relief by the hand of Giotto, and\r\nin particular those of these works; which circumstance can be easily\r\nbelieved, design and invention being father and mother of all these\r\narts and not of one alone. This campanile was destined, according to the\r\nmodel of Giotto, to have a spire, or rather a pyramid, four-sided and\r\nfifty braccia high, as a completion to what is now seen; but, for the\r\nreason that it was a German idea and in an old manner, modern architects\r\nhave never done aught but advise that it should not be made, the work\r\nseeming to be better as it is. For all these works Giotto was not only\r\nmade citizen of Florence, but was given a pension of one hundred florins\r\nyearly by the Commune of Florence, which was something very great in\r\nthose times; and he was made overseer over this work, which was carried\r\non after him by Taddeo Gaddi, for he did not live so long as to be able\r\nto see it finished.\r\n\r\nNow, while this work continued to be carried forward, he made a panel\r\nfor the Nuns of S. Giorgio, and three half-length figures in an arch\r\nover the inner side of the door of the Badia in Florence, now covered\r\nwith whitewash in order to give more light to the church. And in the\r\nGreat Hall of the Podesta of Florence he painted the Commune (an idea\r\nstolen by many), representing it as sitting in the form of Judge,\r\nsceptre in hand, and over its head he placed the balanced scales as\r\nsymbol of the just decisions administered by it, accompanying it with\r\nfour Virtues, that are, Strength with courage, Wisdom with the laws,\r\nJustice with arms, and Temperance with words; this work is beautiful as\r\na picture, and characteristic and appropriate in invention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nTHE FLIGHT INTO EGYPT\r\n\r\n(_After the fresco by_ Giotto. _Padua: Arena Chapel_)]\r\n\r\nAfterwards, having gone again to Padua, besides many other works and\r\nchapels that he painted there, he made a Mundane Glory in the precincts\r\nof the Arena, which gained him much honour and profit. In Milan, also,\r\nhe wrought certain works, that are scattered throughout that city and\r\nheld most beautiful even to this day. Finally, having returned from\r\nMilan, no long time passed before he gave up his soul to God, having\r\nwrought so many most beautiful works in his life, and having been no\r\nless good as Christian than he was excellent as painter. He died in the\r\nyear 1336, to the great grief of all his fellow-citizens--nay, of all\r\nthose who had known him or even only heard his name--and he was buried,\r\neven as his virtues deserved, with great honour, having been loved by\r\nall while he lived, and in particular by the men excellent in all the\r\nprofessions, seeing that, besides Dante, of whom we have spoken\r\nabove, he was much honoured by Petrarca, both he and his works, so\r\ngreatly that it is read in Petrarca's testament that he left to Signor\r\nFrancesco da Carrara, Lord of Padua, among other things held by him in\r\nthe highest veneration, a picture by the hand of Giotto containing a\r\nMadonna, as something rare and very dear to him. And the words of that\r\nclause in the testament run thus:\r\n\r\n\"Transeo ad dispositionem aliarum rerum; et praedicto igitur domino meo\r\nPaduano, quia et ipse per Dei gratiam non eget, et ego nihil aliud habeo\r\ndignum se, mitto tabulam meam sive historiam Beatae Virginis Mariae, opus\r\nJocti pictoris egregii, quae mihi ab amico meo Michaele Vannis de\r\nFlorentia missa est, in cujus pulchritudinem ignorantes non intelligunt,\r\nmagistri autem artis stupent; hanc iconam ipsi domino lego, ut ipsa\r\nVirgo benedicta sibi sit propitia apud filium suum Jesum Christum.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the same Petrarch, in a Latin epistle in the fifth book of his\r\n_Familiar Letters_, says these words:\r\n\r\n\"Atque (ut a veteribus ad nova, ab externis ad nostra transgrediar) duos\r\nego novi pictores egregios, nec formosos, Joctum Florentinum civem,\r\ncujus inter modernos fama ingens est, et Simonem Senensem. Novi\r\nscultores aliquot,\" etc.\r\n\r\nGiotto was buried in S. Maria del Fiore, on the left side as you enter\r\nthe church, where there is a slab of white marble in memory of so great\r\na man. And, as was told in the Life of Cimabue, a commentator of Dante,\r\nwho lived at the same time as Giotto, said: \"Giotto was and is the most\r\neminent among painters in the same city of Florence, and his works bear\r\ntestimony for him in Rome, in Naples, in Avignon, in Florence, in Padua,\r\nand in many other parts of the world.\"\r\n\r\nHis disciples were Taddeo Gaddi, held by him at baptism, as has been\r\nsaid, and Puccio Capanna of Florence, who, working at Rimini in the\r\nChurch of S. Cataldo, belonging to the Preaching Friars, painted\r\nperfectly in fresco the hull of a ship which appears to be sinking in\r\nthe sea, with men who are throwing things into the sea, one of whom is\r\nPuccio himself portrayed from life among a good number of mariners. The\r\nsame man painted many works after the death of Giotto in the Church of\r\nS. Francesco at Assisi, and in the Church of S. Trinita in Florence,\r\nnear the side-door towards the river, he painted the Chapel of the\r\nStrozzi, wherein is the Coronation of the Madonna in fresco, with a\r\nchoir of angels which draw very much to the manner of Giotto; and on the\r\nsides are stories of S. Lucia, very well wrought. In the Badia of\r\nFlorence he painted the Chapel of S. Giovanni Evangelista, belonging to\r\nthe family of Covoni, beside the sacristry; and in Pistoia he wrought in\r\nfresco the principal chapel of the Church of S. Francesco and the Chapel\r\nof S. Lodovico, with the stories of those Saints, passing well painted.\r\nIn the middle of the Church of S. Domenico, in the same city, there are\r\na Crucifix, a Madonna, and a S. John, wrought with much sweetness, and\r\nat their feet a complete human skeleton, wherein (and this was something\r\nunusual in those times) Puccio showed that he had sought to find the\r\nfoundations of art. In this work there is read his name, written by\r\nhimself in this fashion: PUCCIO DI FIORENZA ME FECE. In the arch over\r\nthe door of S. Maria Nuova in the said church there are three\r\nhalf-length figures by his hand, Our Lady with the Child in her arms,\r\nand S. Peter on one side, and on the other S. Francis. He also painted\r\nin the aforesaid city of Assisi, in the lower Church of S. Francesco,\r\nsome scenes of the Passion of Jesus Christ in fresco, with good and very\r\nresolute mastery, and in the chapel of the Church of S. Maria degli\r\nAngeli he wrought in fresco a Christ in Glory, with the Virgin praying\r\nto Him for the Christian people; this work, which is passing good, has\r\nbeen all blackened by the smoke of the lamps and the candles that are\r\nburning there continually in great quantity. And in truth, in so far as\r\nit can be judged, Puccio had the manner and the whole method of working\r\nof his master Giotto, and knew how to make good use of it in the works\r\nthat he wrought, even if, as some have it, he did not live long, having\r\nfallen sick and died by reason of labouring too much in fresco. By his\r\nhand, in so far as is known, is the Chapel of S. Martino in the same\r\nchurch, with the stories of that Saint, wrought in fresco for Cardinal\r\nGentile. There is seen, also, in the middle of the street called\r\nPortica, a Christ at the Column, and in a square picture there is Our\r\nLady, with S. Catherine and S. Clara, one on either side of her. There\r\nare works by his hand scattered about in many other places, such as a\r\npanel with the Passion of Christ, and stories of S. Francis, in the\r\ntramezzo[13] of the church in Bologna; and many others, in short, that\r\nare passed by for the sake of brevity. I will say, indeed, that in\r\nAssisi, where most of his works are, and where it appears to me that he\r\nassisted Giotto in painting, I have found that they hold him as their\r\nfellow-citizen, and that there are still to-day in that city some of the\r\nfamily of the Capanni. Wherefore it may easily be believed that he was\r\nborn in Florence, having written so himself, and that he was a disciple\r\nof Giotto, but that afterwards he took a wife in Assisi, that there he\r\nhad children, and that now he has descendants there. But because it is\r\nof little importance to know this exactly, it is enough to say that he\r\nwas a good master.\r\n\r\nLikewise a disciple of Giotto and a very masterly painter was Ottaviano\r\nda Faenza, who painted many works at Ferrara in S. Giorgio, the seat of\r\nthe Monks of Monte Oliveto; and in Faenza, where he lived and died, he\r\npainted, in the arch over the door of S. Francesco, a Madonna, S. Peter\r\nand S. Paul, and many other works in his said birthplace and in Bologna.\r\n\r\nA disciple of Giotto, also, was Pace da Faenza, who stayed with him long\r\nand assisted him in many works; and in Bologna there are some scenes in\r\nfresco by his hand on the facade of S. Giovanni Decollato. This Pace was\r\nan able man, particularly in making little figures, as can be seen to\r\nthis day in the Church of S. Francesco at Forli, in a Tree of the Cross,\r\nand in a little panel in distemper, wherein is the life of Christ, with\r\nfour little scenes from the life of Our Lady, all very well wrought. It\r\nis said that he wrought in fresco, in the Chapel of S. Antonio at\r\nAssisi, some stories of the life of that Saint, for a Duke of Spoleto\r\nwho is buried in that place together with his son, both having died\r\nfighting in certain suburbs of Assisi, according to what is seen in a\r\nlong inscription that is on the sarcophagus of the said tomb. In the old\r\nbook of the Company of Painters it is found that the same man had\r\nanother disciple, Francesco, called di Maestro Giotto, of whom I have\r\nnothing else to relate.\r\n\r\nGuglielmo of Forli was also a disciple of Giotto, and besides many other\r\nworks he painted the chapel of the high-altar in S. Domenico at Forli,\r\nhis native city. Disciples of Giotto, also, were Pietro Laurati and\r\nSimon Memmi of Siena, Stefano, a Florentine, and Pietro Cavallini, a\r\nRoman; but, seeing that of all these there is account in the Life of\r\neach one of them, let it suffice to have said in this place that they\r\nwere disciples of Giotto, who drew very well for his time and for that\r\nmanner, whereunto witness is borne by many sheets of parchment drawn by\r\nhis hand in water-colour, outlined with the pen, in chiaroscuro, with\r\nthe high lights in white, which are in our book of drawings, and are\r\ntruly a marvel in comparison with those of the masters that lived before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nGiotto, as it has been said, was very ingenious and humorous, and very\r\nwitty in his sayings, whereof there is still vivid memory in that city;\r\nfor besides that which Messer Giovanni Boccaccio wrote about him, Franco\r\nSacchetti, in his three hundred Stories, relates many of them that are\r\nvery beautiful. Of these I will not forbear to write down some with the\r\nvery words of Franco himself, to the end that, together with the story\r\nitself, there may be seen certain modes of speech and expressions of\r\nthose times. He says in one, then, to give it its heading:\r\n\r\n\"To Giotto, a great painter, is given a buckler to paint by a man of\r\nsmall account. He, making a jest of it, paints it in such a fashion that\r\nthe other is put to confusion.\"\r\n\r\nThe story: \"Everyone must have heard already who was Giotto, and how\r\ngreat a painter he was above every other. A clownish fellow, having\r\nheard his fame and having need, perchance for doing watch and ward, to\r\nhave a buckler of his painted, went off incontinent to the shop of\r\nGiotto, with one who carried his buckler behind him, and, arriving where\r\nhe found Giotto, said, 'God save thee, master, I would have thee paint\r\nmy arms on this buckler.' Giotto, considering the man and the way of\r\nhim, said no other word save this, 'When dost thou want it?' And he told\r\nhim; and Giotto said, 'Leave it to me'; and off he went. And Giotto,\r\nbeing left alone, ponders to himself, 'What meaneth this? Can this\r\nfellow have been sent to me in jest? Howsoever it may be, never was\r\nthere brought to me a buckler to paint, and he who brings it is a\r\nsimple manikin and bids me make him his arms as if he were of the\r\nblood-royal of France; i' faith, I must make him a new fashion of arms.'\r\nAnd so, pondering within himself, he put the said buckler before him,\r\nand, having designed what seemed good to him, bade one of his disciples\r\nfinish the painting, and so he did; which painting was a helmet, a\r\ngorget, a pair of arm-pieces, a pair of iron gauntlets, a cuirass and a\r\nback-piece, a pair of thigh-pieces, a pair of leg-pieces, a sword, a\r\ndagger, and a lance. The great man, who knew not what he was in for, on\r\narriving, comes forward and says, 'Master, is it painted, that buckler?'\r\nSaid Giotto, 'Of a truth, it is; go, someone, and bring it down.' The\r\nbuckler coming, that would-be gentleman begins to look at it and says to\r\nGiotto, 'What filthy mess is this that thou hast painted for me?' Said\r\nGiotto, 'And it will seem to thee a right filthy business in the\r\npaying.' Said he, 'I will not pay four farthings for it.' Said Giotto,\r\n'And what didst thou tell me that I was to paint?' And he answered, 'My\r\narms.' Said Giotto,' And are they not here? Is there one wanting?' Said\r\nthe fellow, 'Well, well!' Said Giotto, 'Nay, 'tis not well, God help\r\nthee! And a great booby must thou be, for if one asked thee, \"Who art\r\nthou?\" scarce wouldst thou be able to tell; and here thou comest and\r\nsayest, \"Paint me my arms!\" An thou hadst been one of the Bardi, that\r\nwere enough. What arms dost thou bear? Whence art thou? Who were thy\r\nancestors? Out upon thee! Art not ashamed of thyself? Begin first to\r\ncome into the world before thou pratest of arms as if thou wert Dusnam\r\nof Bavaria. I have made thee a whole suit of armour on thy buckler; if\r\nthere be one piece wanting, name it, and I will have it painted.' Said\r\nhe, 'Thou dost use vile words to me, and hast spoilt me a buckler;' and\r\ntaking himself off, he went to the justice and had Giotto summoned.\r\nGiotto appeared and had him summoned, claiming two florins for the\r\npainting, and the other claimed them from him. The officers, having\r\nheard the pleadings, which Giotto made much the better, judged that the\r\nother should take his buckler so painted, and should give six lire to\r\nGiotto, since he was in the right. Wherefore he was constrained to take\r\nhis buckler and go, and was dismissed; and so, not knowing his measure,\r\nhe had his measure taken.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that Giotto, while working in his boyhood under Cimabue, once\r\npainted a fly on the nose of a figure that Cimabue himself had made, so\r\ntrue to nature that his master, returning to continue the work, set\r\nhimself more than once to drive it away with his hand, thinking that it\r\nwas real, before he perceived his mistake. Many other tricks played by\r\nGiotto and many witty retorts could I relate, but I wish that these,\r\nwhich deal with matters pertinent to art, should be enough for me to\r\nhave told in this place, leaving the rest to the said Franco and others.\r\n\r\nFinally, seeing that there remained memory of Giotto not only in the\r\nworks that issued from his hands, but in those also that issued from the\r\nhand of the writers of those times, he having been the man who recovered\r\nthe true method of painting, which had been lost for many years before\r\nhim; therefore, by public decree and by the effort and particular\r\naffection of the elder Lorenzo de' Medici, the Magnificent, in\r\nadmiration of the talent of so great a man his portrait was placed in S.\r\nMaria del Fiore, carved in marble by Benedetto da Maiano, an excellent\r\nsculptor, together with the verses written below, made by that divine\r\nman, Messer Angelo Poliziano, to the end that those who should become\r\nexcellent in any profession whatsoever might be able to cherish a hope\r\nof obtaining, from others, such memorials as these that Giotto deserved\r\nand obtained in liberal measure from his goodness:\r\n\r\n     Ille ego sum, per quem pictura extincta revixit,\r\n       Cui quam recta manus, tam fuit et facilis.\r\n     Naturae deerat nostrae quod defuit arti;\r\n       Plus licuit nulli pingere, nec melius.\r\n     Miraris turrim egregiam sacro aere sonantem?\r\n       Haec quoque de modulo crevit ad astra meo.\r\n     Denique sum Jottus, quid opus fuit illa referre?\r\n       Hoc nomen longi carminis instar erit.\r\n\r\nAnd to the end that those who come after may be able to see drawings by\r\nthe very hand of Giotto, and from these to recognize all the more the\r\nexcellence of so great a man, in our aforesaid book there are some that\r\nare marvellous, sought out by me with no less diligence than labour and\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: See note on p. 57.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: See note on p. 57.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: See note on p. 57.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGOSTINO AND AGNOLO OF SIENA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF AGOSTINO AND AGNOLO OF SIENA,\r\n\r\nSCULPTORS AND ARCHITECTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong others who exercised themselves in the school of the sculptors\r\nGiovanni and Niccola of Pisa, Agostino and Agnolo, sculptors of Siena,\r\nof whom we are at present about to write the Life, became very excellent\r\nfor those times. These, according to what I find, were born from a\r\nfather and mother of Siena, and their forefathers were architects,\r\nseeing that in the year 1190, under the rule of the three Consuls, they\r\nbrought to perfection the Fontebranda, and afterwards, in the following\r\nyear, under the same Consulate, the Customs-house of that city and other\r\nbuildings. And in truth it is clear that very often the seeds of talent\r\ngerminate in the houses where they have lain for some time, and throw\r\nout shoots which afterwards produce greater and better fruits than the\r\nfirst plants had done. Agostino and Agnolo, then, adding great\r\nbetterment to the manner of Giovanni and Niccola of Pisa, enriched the\r\nart with better design and invention, as their works clearly\r\ndemonstrate. It is said that the aforesaid Giovanni, returning from\r\nNaples to Pisa in the year 1284, stayed in Siena in order to make the\r\ndesign and foundation for the facade of the Duomo, wherein are the three\r\nprincipal doors, to the end that it might be all adorned very richly\r\nwith marbles; and that then Agostino, being no more than fifteen years\r\nof age, went to be with him in order to apply himself to sculpture,\r\nwhereof he had learnt the first principles, being no less inclined to\r\nthis art than to the matters of architecture. And so, under the teaching\r\nof Giovanni, by means of continual study he surpassed all his\r\nfellow-disciples in design, grace, and manner, so greatly that it was\r\nsaid by all that he was the right eye of his master. And because,\r\nbetween people who love each other, there is no gift, whether of\r\nnature, or of soul, or of fortune, that is mutually desired so much as\r\nexcellence, which alone makes men great and noble, and what is more,\r\nmost happy both in this life and in the other, therefore Agostino,\r\nseizing this occasion of assistance from Giovanni, drew his brother\r\nAgnolo into the same pursuit. Nor was it a great labour for him to do\r\nthis, seeing that the intercourse of Agnolo with Agostino and with the\r\nother sculptors had already, as he saw the honour and profit that they\r\nwere drawing from such an art, fired his mind with extreme eagerness and\r\ndesire to apply himself to sculpture; nay, before Agostino had given a\r\nthought to this, Agnolo had wrought certain works in secret.\r\n\r\nAgostino, then, being engaged in working with Giovanni on the marble\r\npanel of the high-altar in the Vescovado of Arezzo, whereof there has\r\nbeen mention above, contrived to bring there the said Agnolo, his\r\nbrother, who acquitted himself in this work in such a manner that when\r\nit was finished he was found to have equalled Agostino in the excellence\r\nof his art. Which circumstance, becoming known to Giovanni, was the\r\nreason that after this work he made use of both one and the other in\r\nmany other works of his that he wrought in Pistola, in Pisa, and in\r\nother places. And seeing that he applied himself not only to sculpture\r\nbut to architecture as well, no long time passed before, under the rule\r\nof the Nine in Siena, Agostino made the design of their Palace in\r\nMalborghetto, which was in the year 1308. In the making of this he\r\nacquired so great a name in his country, that, returning to Siena after\r\nthe death of Giovanni, they were made, both one and the other,\r\narchitects to the State; wherefore afterwards, in the year 1317, there\r\nwas made under their direction the front of the Duomo that faces towards\r\nthe north, and in the year 1321, with the design of the same men, there\r\nwas begun the construction of the Porta Romana in that manner wherein it\r\nstands to-day, and it was finished in the year 1326; which gate was\r\nfirst called Porta S. Martino. They rebuilt, also, the Porta a Tufi,\r\nwhich at first was called Porta di S. Agata all'Arco. In the same year,\r\nwith the design of the same Agostino and Agnolo, there was begun the\r\nChurch and Convent of S. Francesco in the presence of Cardinal di Gaeta,\r\nApostolic Legate. No long time after, by the action of some of the\r\nTolomei who were living as exiles at Orvieto, Agostino and Agnolo were\r\nsummoned to make certain sculptures for the work of S. Maria in that\r\ncity; wherefore, going there, they carved some prophets in marble which\r\nare now, in comparison with the other statues in that facade, the finest\r\nand best proportioned in that so greatly renowned work.\r\n\r\nNow it came to pass in the year 1326, as it has been said in his Life,\r\nthat Giotto was called by means of Charles, Duke of Calabria, who was\r\nthen staying in Florence, to Naples, in order to make some things for\r\nKing Robert in S. Chiara and other places in that city; wherefore\r\nGiotto, passing by way of Orvieto on his way to Naples, in order to see\r\nthe works that had been made and were still being made there by so many\r\nmen, wished to see everything minutely. And because the prophets of\r\nAgostino and Agnolo of Siena pleased him more than all the other\r\nsculptures, it came about therefore that Giotto not only commended them\r\nand held them, much to their contentment, among his friends, but also\r\npresented them to Piero Saccone da Pietramala as the best of all the\r\nsculptors then living, for the making of the tomb of Bishop Guido, Lord\r\nand Bishop of Arezzo, which has been mentioned in the Life of Giotto\r\nhimself. And so then Giotto having seen in Orvieto the works of many\r\nsculptors and having judged the best to be those of Agostino and Agnolo\r\nof Siena, this was the reason that the said tomb was given to them to\r\nmake--in that manner, however, wherein he had designed it, and according\r\nto the model which he himself had sent to the said Piero Saccone.\r\nAgostino and Agnolo finished this tomb in the space of three years,\r\nexecuting it with much diligence, and built it into the Church of the\r\nVescovado of Arezzo, in the Chapel of the Sacrament. Over the\r\nsarcophagus, which rests on certain great consoles carved more than\r\npassing well, there is stretched the body of that Bishop in marble, and\r\nat the sides are some angels that are drawing back certain curtains very\r\ngracefully. Besides this, there are carved in half-relief, in\r\ncompartments, twelve scenes from the life and actions of that Bishop,\r\nwith an infinite number of little figures. I will not grudge the labour\r\nof describing the contents of these scenes, to the end that it may be\r\nseen with what great patience they were wrought, and how zealously\r\nthese sculptors sought the good manner.\r\n\r\nIn the first is the scene when, assisted by the Ghibelline party of\r\nMilan, which sent him money and four hundred masons, he is rebuilding\r\nthe walls of Arezzo all anew, making them much longer than they were and\r\ngiving them the form of a galley. In the second is the taking of\r\nLucignano di Valdichiana. In the third, that of Chiusi. In the fourth,\r\nthat of Fronzoli, then a strong castle above Poppi, and held by the sons\r\nof the Count of Battifolle. The fifth is when the Castle of Rondine,\r\nafter having been many months besieged by the Aretines, is surrendering\r\nfinally to the Bishop. In the sixth is the taking of the Castle of\r\nBucine in Valdarno. The seventh is when he is taking by storm the\r\nfortress of Caprese, which belonged to the Count of Romena, after having\r\nmaintained the siege for several months. In the eighth the Bishop is\r\nhaving the Castle of Laterino pulled down and the hill that rises above\r\nit cut into the shape of a cross, to the end that it may no longer be\r\npossible to build a fortress thereon. In the ninth he is seen destroying\r\nMonte Sansovino and putting it to fire and flames, chasing from it all\r\nthe inhabitants. In the eleventh is his coronation, wherein are to be\r\nseen many beautiful costumes of soldiers on foot and on horseback, and\r\nof other people. In the twelfth, finally, his men are seen carrying him\r\nfrom Montenero, where he fell sick, to Massa, and thence afterwards, now\r\ndead, to Arezzo. Round this tomb, also, in many places, are the\r\nGhibelline insignia, and the arms of the Bishop, which are six square\r\nstones \"or,\" on a field \"azure,\" in the same ordering as are the six\r\nballs in the arms of the Medici; which arms of the house of the Bishop\r\nwere described by Frate Guittone, chevalier and poet of Arezzo, when he\r\nsaid, writing of the site of the Castle of Pietramala, whence that\r\nfamily had its origin:\r\n\r\n     Dove si scontra il Giglion con la Chiassa\r\n     Ivi furono i miei antecessori,\r\n     Che in campo azurro d'or portan sei sassa.\r\n\r\nAgnolo and Agostino of Siena, then, executed this work with better art\r\nand invention and with more diligence than there had been shown in any\r\nwork executed in their times. And in truth they deserve nothing but\r\ninfinite praise, having made therein so many figures and so great a\r\nvariety of sites, places, towers, horses, men, and other things, that it\r\nis indeed a marvel. And although this tomb was in great part destroyed\r\nby the Frenchmen of the Duke of Anjou, who sacked the greater part of\r\nthat city in order to take revenge on the hostile party for certain\r\naffronts received, none the less it shows that it was wrought with very\r\ngood judgment by the said Agostino and Agnolo, who cut on it, in rather\r\nlarge letters, these words:\r\n\r\n     HOC OPUS FECIT MAGISTER AUGUSTINUS ET MAGISTER ANGELUS DE SENIS.\r\n\r\nAfter this, in the year 1329, they wrought an altar-panel of marble for\r\nthe Church of S. Francesco at Bologna, in a passing good manner; and\r\ntherein, besides the carved ornamentation, which is very rich, they made\r\na Christ who is crowning Our Lady, and on each side three similar\r\nfigures--S. Francis, S. James, S. Dominic, S. Anthony of Padua, S.\r\nPetronius, and S. John the Evangelist, with figures one braccio and a\r\nhalf in height. Below each of the said figures is carved a scene in\r\nlow-relief from the life of the Saint that is above; and in all these\r\nscenes is an infinite number of half-length figures, which make a rich\r\nand beautiful adornment, according to the custom of those times. It is\r\nseen clearly that Agostino and Agnolo endured very great fatigue in this\r\nwork, and that they put into it all diligence and study in order to make\r\nit, as it truly was, a work worthy of praise; and although they are half\r\neaten away, yet there are to be read thereon their names and the date,\r\nby means of which, it being known when they began it, it is seen that\r\nthey laboured eight whole years in completing it. It is true, indeed,\r\nthat in that same time they wrought many other small works in diverse\r\nplaces and for various people.\r\n\r\nNow, while they were working in Bologna, that city, by the mediation of\r\na Legate of the Pope, gave herself absolutely over to the Church; and\r\nthe Pope, in return, promised that he would go to settle with his Court\r\nin Bologna, saying that he wished to erect a castle there, or truly a\r\nfortress, for his own security. This being conceded to him by the\r\nBolognese, it was immediately built under the direction and design of\r\nAgostino and Agnolo, but it had a very short life, for the reason that\r\nthe Bolognese, having found that the many promises of the Pope were\r\nwholly vain, pulled down and destroyed the said fortress, with much\r\ngreater promptness than it had been built.\r\n\r\nIt is said that while these two sculptors were staying in Bologna the Po\r\nissued in furious flood from its bed and laid waste the whole country\r\nround for many miles, doing incredible damage to the territory of Mantua\r\nand Ferrara and slaying more than ten thousand persons; and that they,\r\nbeing called on for this reason as ingenious and able men, found a way\r\nto put this terrible river back into its course, confining it with dykes\r\nand other most useful barriers; which was greatly to their credit and\r\nprofit, because, besides acquiring fame thereby, they were recompensed\r\nby the Lords of Mantua and by the D'Este family with most honourable\r\nrewards.\r\n\r\nAfter this they returned to Siena, and in the year 1338, with their\r\ndirection and design, there was made the new Church of S. Maria, near\r\nthe Duomo Vecchio, towards Piazza Manetti; and no long time after, the\r\npeople of Siena, remaining much satisfied with all the works that these\r\nmen were making, determined with an occasion so apt to put into effect\r\nthat which had been discussed many times, but up to then in\r\nvain--namely, the making of a public fountain on the principal square,\r\nopposite the Palagio della Signoria. Wherefore, this being entrusted to\r\nAgostino and Agnolo, they brought the waters of that fountain through\r\npipes of lead and of clay, which was very difficult, and it began to\r\nplay in the year 1343, on the first day of June, with much pleasure and\r\ncontentment to the whole city, which remained thereby much indebted to\r\nthe talent of these its two citizens.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time there was made the Great Council Chamber in the\r\nMunicipal Palace; and so too, with the direction and design of the same\r\nmen, there was brought to its completion the tower of the said Palace,\r\nin the year 1344, and there were placed thereon two great bells, whereof\r\nthey had one from Grosseto and the other was made in Siena. Finally,\r\nwhile Agnolo chanced to be in the city of Assisi, where he made a\r\nchapel and a tomb in marble in the lower Church of S. Francesco for a\r\nbrother of Napoleone Orsino, a Cardinal and a friar of S. Francis, who\r\nhad died in that place--Agostino, who had remained in Siena in the\r\nservice of the State, died while he was busy making the design for the\r\nadornments of the said fountain in the square, and was honourably buried\r\nin the Duomo. I have not yet found, and cannot therefore say anything\r\nabout the matter, either how or when Agnolo died, or even any other\r\nworks of importance by their hand; and therefore let this be the end of\r\ntheir Life.\r\n\r\nNow, seeing that it would be without doubt an error, in following the\r\norder of time, not to make mention of some who, although they have not\r\nwrought so many works that it is possible to write their whole life,\r\nhave none the less contributed betterment and beauty to art and to the\r\nworld, I will say, taking occasion from that which has been said above\r\nabout the Vescovado of Arezzo and about the Pieve, that Pietro and Paolo,\r\ngoldsmiths of Arezzo, who learnt design from Agnolo and Agostino of\r\nSiena, were the first who wrought large works of some excellence with\r\nthe chasing-tool, since, for an arch-priest of the said Pieve of Arezzo,\r\nthey executed a head in silver as large as life, wherein was placed the\r\nhead of S. Donatus, Bishop and Protector of that city; which work was\r\nworthy of nothing but praise, both because they made therein some very\r\nbeautiful figures in enamel and other ornaments, and because it was one\r\nof the first works, as it has been said, that were wrought with the\r\nchasing-tool.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, the Guild of Calimara in Florence caused Maestro\r\nCione, an excellent goldsmith, to make the greater part, if not the\r\nwhole, of the silver altar of S. Giovanni Battista, wherein are many\r\nscenes from the life of that Saint embossed on a plate of silver, with\r\npassing good figures in half-relief; which work, both by reason of its\r\nsize and of its being something new, was held marvellous by all who saw\r\nit. In the year 1330, after the body of S. Zanobi had been found beneath\r\nthe vaults of S. Reparata, the same Maestro Cione made a head of silver\r\nto contain a piece of the head of that Saint, which is still preserved\r\nto-day in the same head of silver and is borne in processions; which\r\nhead was then held something very beautiful and gave a great name to its\r\ncraftsman, who died no long time after, rich and in great repute.\r\n\r\nMaestro Cione left many disciples, and among others Forzore di Spinello\r\nof Arezzo, who wrought every kind of chasing very well but was\r\nparticularly excellent in making scenes in silver enamelled over fire,\r\nto which witness is borne by a mitre with most beautiful adornments in\r\nenamel, and a very beautiful pastoral staff of silver, which are in the\r\nVescovado of Arezzo. The same man wrought for Cardinal Galeotto da\r\nPietramala many works in silver that remained after his death with the\r\nfriars of La Vernia, where he wished to be buried. There, besides the\r\nwall that was erected in that place by Count Orlando, Lord of Chiusi, a\r\nsmall town below La Vernia, the Cardinal built the church, together with\r\nmany rooms in the convent and throughout that whole place, without\r\nputting his arms there or leaving any other memorial. A disciple of\r\nMaestro Cione, also, was Leonardo di Ser Giovanni, a Florentine, who\r\nwrought many works in chasing and soldering, with better design than the\r\nothers before him had shown, and in particular the altar and panel of\r\nsilver in S. Jacopo at Pistoia; in which work, besides the scenes, which\r\nare numerous, there was much praise given to a figure in the round that\r\nhe made in the middle, representing S. James, more than one braccio in\r\nheight, and wrought with so great finish that it appears rather to have\r\nbeen made by casting than by chasing. This figure is set in the midst of\r\nthe said scenes on the panel of the altar, round which is a frieze of\r\nletters in enamel, that run thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n     AD HONOREM DEI ET SANCTI JACOBI APOSTOLI, HOC OPUS FACTUM FUIT\r\n     TEMPORE DOMINI FRANC. PAGNI DICTAE OPERAE OPERARII SUB ANNO 1371\r\n     PER ME LEONARDUM SER JO. DE FLOREN. AURIFIC.\r\n\r\nNow, returning to Agostino and Agnolo: they had many disciples who,\r\nafter their death, wrought many works of architecture and of sculpture\r\nin Lombardy and other parts of Italy, and among others Maestro Jacopo\r\nLanfrani of Venice, who founded S. Francesco of Imola and wrought the\r\nprincipal door in sculpture, where he carved his name and the date,\r\nwhich was the year 1343. And at Bologna, in the Church of S. Domenico,\r\nthe same Maestro Jacopo made a tomb in marble for Giovanni Andrea\r\nCalduino, Doctor of Laws and Secretary to Pope Clement VI; and another,\r\nalso in marble and in the said church, very well wrought, for Taddeo\r\nPeppoli, Conservator of the people and of Justice in Bologna. And in the\r\nsame year, which was the year 1347, or a little before, this tomb being\r\nfinished, Maestro Jacopo went to his native city of Venice and founded\r\nthe Church of S. Antonio, which was previously of wood, at the request\r\nof a Florentine Abbot of the ancient family of the Abati, the Doge being\r\nMesser Andrea Dandolo. This church was finished in the year 1349.\r\nJacobello and Pietro Paolo, also, Venetians and disciples of Agostino\r\nand Agnolo, made a tomb in marble for Messer Giovanni da Lignano, Doctor\r\nof Laws, in the year 1383, in the Church of S. Domenico at Bologna.\r\n\r\nAll these and many other sculptors went on for a long space of time\r\nfollowing one and the same method, in a manner that with it they filled\r\nall Italy. It is believed, also, that the Pesarese, who, besides many\r\nother works, built the Church of S. Domenico in his native city, and\r\nmade in sculpture the marble door with the three figures in the round,\r\nGod the Father, S. John the Baptist, and S. Mark, was a disciple of\r\nAgostino and Agnolo; and to this the manner bears witness. This work was\r\nfinished in the year 1385. But, seeing that it would take too long if I\r\nwere to make mention minutely of the works that were wrought by many\r\nmasters of those times in that manner, I wish that this, that I have\r\nsaid of them thus in general, should suffice me for the present, and\r\nabove all because there is not any benefit of much account for our arts\r\nfrom such works. Of the aforesaid it has seemed to me proper to make\r\nmention, because, if they do not deserve to be discussed at length, yet,\r\non the other hand, they were not such as to need to be passed over\r\ncompletely in silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEFANO AND UGOLINO SANESE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF STEFANO, PAINTER OF FLORENCE, AND OF UGOLINO SANESE\r\n\r\n[_UGOLINO DA SIENA_]\r\n\r\n\r\nStefano, painter of Florence and disciple of Giotto, was so excellent,\r\nthat he not only surpassed all the others who had laboured in the art\r\nbefore him, but outstripped his own master himself by so much that he\r\nwas held, and deservedly, the best of all the painters who had lived up\r\nto that time, as his works clearly demonstrate. He painted in fresco the\r\nMadonna of the Campo Santo in Pisa, which is no little better in design\r\nand in colouring than the work of Giotto; and in Florence, in the\r\ncloister of S. Spirito, he painted three little arches in fresco. In the\r\nfirst of these, wherein is the Transfiguration of Christ with Moses and\r\nElias, imagining how great must have been the splendour that dazzled\r\nthem, he fashioned the three Disciples with extraordinary and beautiful\r\nattitudes, and enveloped in draperies in a manner that it is seen that\r\nhe went on trying to do something that had never been done\r\nbefore--namely, to suggest the nude form of the figures below new kinds\r\nof folds, which, as I have said, had not been thought of even by Giotto.\r\nUnder this arch, wherein he made a Christ delivering the woman\r\npossessed, he drew a building in perspective, perfectly and in a manner\r\nthen little known, executing it in good form and with better knowledge;\r\nand in it, working with very great judgment in modern fashion, he showed\r\nso great art and so great invention and proportion in the columns, in\r\nthe doors, in the windows, and in the cornices, and so great diversity\r\nfrom the other masters in his method of working, that it appears that\r\nthere was beginning to be seen a certain glimmer of the good and perfect\r\nmanner of the moderns. He invented, among other ingenious ideas, a\r\nflight of steps very difficult to make, which, both in painting and\r\nbuilt out in relief--wrought in either way, in fact--is so rich in\r\ndesign and variety, and so useful and convenient in invention, that the\r\nelder Lorenzo de' Medici, the Magnificent, availed himself of it in\r\nmaking the outer staircase of the Palace of Poggio a Cajano, now the\r\nprincipal villa of the most Illustrious Lord Duke. In the other little\r\narch is a story of Christ when he is delivering S. Peter from shipwreck,\r\nso well done that one seems to hear the voice of Peter saying: \"Domine,\r\nsalva nos, perimus.\" This work is judged much more beautiful than the\r\nothers, because, besides the softness of the draperies, there are seen\r\nsweetness in the air of the heads and terror in the perils of the sea,\r\nand because the Apostles, shaken by diverse motions and by phantoms of\r\nthe sea, have been represented in attitudes very appropriate and all\r\nmost beautiful. And although time has eaten away in part the labours\r\nthat Stefano put into this work, it may be seen, although but dimly,\r\nthat the Apostles are defending themselves from the fury of the winds\r\nand from the waves of the sea with great energy; which work, being very\r\nhighly praised among the moderns, must have certainly appeared a miracle\r\nin all Tuscany in the time of him who wrought it. After this he painted\r\na S. Thomas Aquinas beside a door in the first cloister of S. Maria\r\nNovella, where he also made a Crucifix, which was afterwards executed in\r\na bad manner by other painters in restoring it. In like manner he left a\r\nchapel in the church begun and not finished, which has been much eaten\r\naway by time, wherein the angels are seen raining down in diverse forms\r\nby reason of the pride of Lucifer; where it is to be noticed that the\r\nfigures, with the arms, trunks, and legs foreshortened much better than\r\nany foreshortenings that had been made before, give us to know that\r\nStefano began to understand and to demonstrate in part the difficulties\r\nthat those men had to reduce to excellence, who afterwards, with greater\r\nscience, showed them to us, as they have done, in perfection; wherefore\r\nthe surname of \"The Ape of Nature\" was given him by the other craftsmen.\r\n\r\nNext, being summoned to Milan, Stefano made a beginning for many works\r\nfor Matteo Visconti, but was not able to finish them, because, having\r\nfallen sick by reason of the change of air, he was forced to return to\r\nFlorence. There, having regained his health, he made in fresco, in the\r\ntramezzo[14] of the Church of S. Croce, in the Chapel of the Asini, the\r\nstory of the martyrdom of S. Mark, when he was dragged to death, with\r\nmany figures that have something of the good. Being then summoned to\r\nRome by reason of having been a disciple of Giotto, he made some stories\r\nof Christ in S. Pietro, in the principal chapel wherein is the altar of\r\nthe said Saint, between the windows that are in the great choir-niche,\r\nwith so much diligence that it is seen that he approached closely to the\r\nmodern manner, surpassing his master Giotto considerably in\r\ndraughtsmanship and in other respects.\r\n\r\nAfter this, on a pillar on the left-hand side of the principal chapel of\r\nthe Araceli, he made a S. Louis in fresco, which is much praised,\r\nbecause it has in it a vivacity never displayed up to that time even by\r\nGiotto. And in truth Stefano had great facility in draughtsmanship, as\r\ncan be seen in our said book in a drawing by his hand, wherein is drawn\r\nthe Transfiguration (which he painted in the cloister of S. Spirito), in\r\nsuch a manner that in my judgment he drew much better than Giotto.\r\n\r\nHaving gone, next, to Assisi, he began in fresco a scene of the\r\nCelestial Glory in the niche of the principal chapel of the lower Church\r\nof S. Francesco, where the choir is; and although he did not finish it,\r\nit is seen from what he did that he used so great diligence that no\r\ngreater could be desired. In this work there is seen begun a circle of\r\nsaints, both male and female, with so beautiful variety in the faces of\r\nthe young, the men of middle age, and the old, that nothing better could\r\nbe desired. And there is seen a very sweet manner in these blessed\r\nspirits, with such great harmony that it appears almost impossible that\r\nit could have been done in those times by Stefano, who indeed did do it;\r\nalthough there is nothing of the figures in this circle finished save\r\nthe heads, over which is a choir of angels who are hovering playfully\r\nabout in various attitudes, appropriately carrying theological symbols\r\nin their hands, and all turned towards a Christ on the Cross, who is in\r\nthe middle of this work, over the head of a S. Francis, who is in the\r\nmidst of an infinity of saints. Besides this, in the border of the\r\nwhole work, he made some angels, each of whom is holding in his hand one\r\nof those Churches that S. John the Evangelist described in the\r\nApocalypse; and these angels are executed with so much grace that I am\r\namazed how in that age there was to be found one who knew so much.\r\nStefano began this work with a view to bringing it to the fullest\r\nperfection, and he would have succeeded, but he was forced to leave it\r\nimperfect and to return to Florence by some important affairs of his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nDuring that time, then, that he stayed for this purpose in Florence, in\r\norder to lose no time he painted for the Gianfigliazzi, by the side of\r\nthe Arno, between their houses and the Ponte alla Carraja, a little\r\nshrine on a corner that is there, wherein he depicted a Madonna sewing,\r\nto whom a boy dressed and seated is handing a bird, with such diligence\r\nthat the work, small as it is, deserves to be praised no less than do\r\nthe works that he wrought on a larger and more masterly scale.\r\n\r\nThis shrine finished and his affairs dispatched, being called to Pistoia\r\nby its Lords in the year 1346, he was made to paint the Chapel of S.\r\nJacopo, on the vaulting of which he made a God the Father with some\r\nApostles, and on the walls the stories of that Saint, and in particular\r\nwhen his mother, wife of Zebedee, asks Jesus Christ to consent to place\r\nher two sons, one on His right hand and the other on His left hand, in\r\nthe Kingdom of the Father. Close to this is the beheading of the said\r\nSaint, a very beautiful work.\r\n\r\nIt is reputed that Maso, called Giottino, of whom there will be mention\r\nbelow, was the son of this Stefano; and although many, by reason of the\r\nsuggestiveness of the name, hold him the son of Giotto, I, by reason of\r\ncertain records that I have seen, and of certain memoirs of good\r\nauthority written by Lorenzo Ghiberti and by Domenico del Ghirlandajo,\r\nhold it as true that he was rather the son of Stefano than of Giotto. Be\r\nthis as it may, returning to Stefano, it can be credited to him that he\r\ndid more than anyone after Giotto to improve painting, for, besides\r\nbeing more varied in invention, he was also more harmonious, more\r\nmellow, and better blended in colouring than all the others; and\r\nabove all he had no peer in diligence. And as for those foreshortenings\r\nthat he made, although, as I have said, he showed a faulty manner in\r\nthem by reason of the difficulty of making them, none the less he who is\r\nthe pioneer in the difficulties of any exercise deserves a much greater\r\nname than those who follow with a somewhat more ordered and regular\r\nmanner. Truly great, therefore, is the debt that should be acknowledged\r\nto Stefano, because he who walks in darkness and gives heart to others,\r\nby showing them the way, brings it about that its difficult steps are\r\nmade easy, so that with lapse of time men leave the false road and\r\nattain to the desired goal. At Perugia, too, in the Church of S.\r\nDomenico, he began in fresco the Chapel of S. Caterina, which remained\r\nunfinished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Berlin Photo. Co._\r\n\r\nSS. PAUL, PETER AND JOHN THE BAPTIST\r\n\r\n(_After the painting by_ Ugolino Sanese [da Siena]. _Berlin: K.\r\nFriedrich Museum, 1635_)]\r\n\r\nThere lived about the same time as Stefano a man of passing good repute,\r\nUgolino, painter of Siena, very much his friend, who painted many panels\r\nand chapels throughout all Italy, although he held ever in great part to\r\nthe Greek manner, as one who, grown old therein, had wished by reason of\r\na certain obstinacy in himself to hold rather to the manner of Cimabue\r\nthan to that of Giotto, which was so greatly revered. By the hand of\r\nUgolino, then, is the panel of the high-altar of S. Croce, on a ground\r\nall of gold, and also a panel which stood many years on the high-altar\r\nof S. Maria Novella and is to-day in the Chapter-house, where the\r\nSpanish nation every year holds most solemn festival on the day of S.\r\nJames, with other offices and funeral ceremonies of its own. Besides\r\nthese, he wrought many other works with good skill, without departing,\r\nhowever, from the manner of his master. The same man made, on a\r\nbrick-pier in the Loggia that Lapo had built on the Piazza\r\nd'Orsanmichele, that Madonna which worked so many miracles, not many\r\nyears later, that the Loggia was for a long time full of images, and is\r\nstill held in the greatest veneration. Finally, in the Chapel of Messer\r\nRidolfo de' Bardi, which is in S. Croce, where Giotto painted the life\r\nof S. Francis, he painted a Crucifix in distemper on the altar-panel,\r\nwith a Magdalene and a S. John weeping, and two friars, one on either\r\nside. Ugolino passed away from this life, being old, in the year 1349,\r\nand was buried with honour in Siena, his native city.\r\n\r\nBut returning to Stefano, of whom they say that he was also a good\r\narchitect, which is proved by what has been said above, he died, so it\r\nis said, in the year when there began the jubilee, 1350, at the age of\r\nforty-nine, and was laid to rest in the tomb of his fathers, in S.\r\nSpirito, with this epitaph:\r\n\r\n     STEPHANO FLORENTINO PICTORI, FACIUNDIS IMAGINIBUS AC COLORANDIS\r\n     FIGURIS NULLI UNQUAM INFERIORI, AFFINES MOESTISS.

Maria\r\ndella Pieve_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF PIETRO LAURATI\r\n\r\n[_PIETRO LORENZETTI_],\r\n\r\nPAINTER OF SIENA\r\n\r\n\r\nPietro Laurati, an excellent painter of Siena, proved in his life how\r\ngreat is the contentment of the truly able, who feel that their works\r\nare prized both at home and abroad, and who see themselves sought after\r\nby all men, for the reason that in the course of his life he was sent\r\nfor and held dear throughout all Tuscany, having first become known\r\nthrough the scenes that he painted in fresco for the Scala, a hospital\r\nin Siena, wherein he imitated in such wise the manner of Giotto, then\r\nspread throughout all Tuscany, that it was believed with great reason\r\nthat he was destined, as afterwards came to pass, to become a better\r\nmaster than Cimabue and Giotto and the others had been; for the figures\r\nthat represent the Virgin ascending the steps of the Temple, accompanied\r\nby Joachim and Anna, and received by the priest, and then in the\r\nMarriage, are so beautifully adorned, so well draped, and so simply\r\nwrapped in their garments, that they show majesty in the air of the\r\nheads, and a most beautiful manner in their bearing. By reason of this\r\nwork, which was the first introduction into Siena of the good method of\r\npainting, giving light to the many beautiful intellects which have\r\nflourished in that city in every age, Pietro was invited to Monte\r\nOliveto di Chiusuri, where he painted a panel in distemper that is\r\nplaced to-day in the portico below the church. In Florence, next,\r\nopposite to the left-hand door of the Church of S. Spirito, on the\r\ncorner where to-day there is a butcher, he painted a shrine which, by\r\nreason of the softness of the heads and of the sweetness that is seen in\r\nit, deserves the highest praise from every discerning craftsman.\r\n\r\nGoing from Florence to Pisa, he wrought in the Campo Santo, on the wall\r\nthat is beside the principal door, all the lives of the Holy Fathers,\r\nwith expressions so lively and attitudes so beautiful that he equalled\r\nGiotto and gained thereby very great praise, having expressed in certain\r\nheads, both with drawing and with colour, all that vivacity that the\r\nmanner of those times was able to show. From Pisa he went to Pistoia,\r\nwhere he made a Madonna with some angels round her, very well grouped,\r\non a panel in distemper, for the Church of S. Francesco; and in the\r\npredella that ran below this panel, in certain scenes, he made certain\r\nlittle figures so lively and so vivid that in those times it was\r\nsomething marvellous; wherefore, since they satisfied himself no less\r\nthan others, he thought fit to place thereon his name, with these words:\r\nPETRUS LAURATI DE SENIS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIETRO LORENZETTI: MADONNA AND CHILD WITH S.S. FRANCIS\r\nAND JOHN\r\n\r\n_(Assisi: Lower Church of S. Francesco. Fresco)_]\r\n\r\nPietro was summoned, next, in the year 1355, by Messer Guglielmo,\r\narch-priest, and by the Wardens of Works of the Pieve of Arezzo, who\r\nwere then Margarito Boschi and others; and in that church, built long\r\nbefore with better design and manner than any other that had been made\r\nin Tuscany up to that time, and all adorned with squared stone and with\r\ncarvings, as it has been said, by the hand of Margaritone, he painted in\r\nfresco the apse and the whole great niche of the chapel of the\r\nhigh-altar, making there twelve scenes from the life of Our Lady with\r\nfigures large as life, beginning with the expulsion of Joachim from the\r\nTemple, up to the Nativity of Jesus Christ. In these scenes, wrought in\r\nfresco, may be recognized almost the same inventions (the lineaments,\r\nthe air of the heads, and the attitudes of the figures) which had been\r\ncharacteristic of and peculiar to Giotto, his master. And although all\r\nthis work is beautiful, what he painted on the vaulting of this niche is\r\nwithout doubt better than all the rest, for in representing the Madonna\r\nascending into Heaven, besides making the Apostles each four braccia\r\nhigh, wherein he showed greatness of spirit and was the first to try to\r\ngive grandness to the manner, he gave so beautiful an air to the heads\r\nand so great loveliness to the vestments that in those times nothing\r\nmore could have been desired. Likewise, in the faces of a choir of\r\nangels who are flying in the air round the Madonna, dancing with\r\ngraceful movements, and appearing to sing, he painted a gladness\r\ntruly angelic and divine, above all because he made the angels\r\nsounding diverse instruments, with their eyes all fixed and intent on\r\nanother choir of angels, who, supported by a cloud in the form of an\r\nalmond, are bearing the Madonna to Heaven, with beautiful attitudes and\r\nall surrounded by rainbows. This work, seeing that it rightly gave\r\npleasure, was the reason that he was commissioned to make in distemper\r\nthe panel for the high-altar of the aforesaid Pieve; wherein, in five\r\nparts, with figures as far as the knees and large as life, he made Our\r\nLady with the Child in her arms, and S. John the Baptist and S. Matthew\r\non the one side, and on the other the Evangelist and S. Donatus, with\r\nmany little figures in the predella and in the border of the panel\r\nabove, all truly beautiful and executed in very good manner. This panel,\r\nafter I had rebuilt the high-altar of the aforesaid Pieve completely\r\nanew, at my own expense and with my own hand, was set up over the altar\r\nof S. Cristofano at the foot of the church. Nor do I wish to grudge the\r\nlabour of saying in this place, with this occasion and not wide of the\r\nsubject, that I, moved by Christian piety and by the affection that I\r\nbear towards this venerable and ancient collegiate church, and for the\r\nreason that in it, in my earliest childhood, I learnt my first lessons,\r\nand that it contains the remains of my fathers: moved, I say, by these\r\nreasons, and by it appearing to me that it was wellnigh deserted, I have\r\nrestored it in a manner that it can be said that it has returned from\r\ndeath to life; for besides changing it from a dark to a well-lighted\r\nchurch by increasing the windows that were there before and by making\r\nothers, I have also removed the choir, which, being in front, used to\r\noccupy a great part of the church, and to the great satisfaction of\r\nthose reverend canons I have placed it behind the high-altar. This new\r\naltar, standing by itself, has on the panel in front a Christ calling\r\nPeter and Andrew from their nets, and on the side towards the choir it\r\nhas, on another panel, S. George slaying the Dragon. On the sides are\r\nfour pictures, and in each of these are two saints as large as life.\r\nThen above, and below in the predella, there is an infinity of other\r\nfigures, which, for brevity's sake, are not enumerated. The ornamental\r\nframe of this altar is thirteen braccia high, and the predella is two\r\nbraccia high. And because within it is hollow, and one ascends to it by\r\na staircase through an iron wicket very conveniently arranged, there are\r\npreserved in it many venerable relics, which can be seen from without\r\nthrough two gratings that are in the front part; and among others there\r\nis the head of S. Donatus, Bishop and Protector of that city, and in a\r\ncoffer of variegated marble, three braccia long, which I have had\r\nrestored, are the bones of four Saints. And the predella of the altar,\r\nwhich surrounds it all right round in due proportion, has in front of it\r\nthe tabernacle, or rather ciborium, of the Sacrament, made of carved\r\nwood and all gilt, about three braccia high; which tabernacle is in the\r\nround and can be seen as well from the side of the choir as from in\r\nfront. And because I have spared no labour and no expense, considering\r\nmyself bound to act thus in honour of God, this work, in my judgment,\r\nhas in all those ornaments of gold, of carvings, of paintings, of\r\nmarbles, of travertines, of variegated marbles, of porphyries, and of\r\nother stones, the best that could be got together by me in that place.\r\n\r\nBut returning now to Pietro Laurati; that panel finished whereof there\r\nhas been talk above, he wrought in S. Pietro at Rome many works which\r\nwere afterwards destroyed in making the new building of S. Pietro. He\r\nalso wrought some works in Cortona and in Arezzo, besides those that\r\nhave been mentioned, and some others in the Church of S. Fiora e\r\nLucilla, a monastery of Black Friars, and in particular, in a chapel, a\r\nS. Thomas who is putting his hand on the wound in the breast of Christ.\r\n\r\nA disciple of Pietro was Bartolommeo Bologhini of Siena, who wrought\r\nmany panels in Siena and other places in Italy, and in Florence there is\r\none by his hand on the altar of the Chapel of S. Silvestro in S. Croce.\r\nThe pictures of these men date about the year of our salvation 1350; and\r\nin my book, so many times cited, there is seen a drawing by the hand of\r\nPietro, wherein a shoemaker who is sewing, with simple but very natural\r\nlineaments, shows very great expression and the characteristic manner of\r\nPietro, the portrait of whom, by the hand of Bartolommeo Bologhini, was\r\nin a panel in Siena, when I copied it from the original in the manner\r\nthat is seen above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anderson_\r\n\r\nTHE DEPOSITION FROM THE CROSS\r\n\r\n(_After the fresco of the_ Roman School. _Assisi: Upper Church of S.\r\nFrancesco_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANDREA PISANO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF ANDREA PISANO,\r\n\r\nSCULPTOR AND ARCHITECT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe art of painting never flourished at any time without the sculptors\r\nalso pursuing their exercise with excellence, and to this the works of\r\nall ages bear witness for the close observer, because these two arts are\r\ntruly sisters, born at one and the same time, and fostered and governed\r\nby one and the same soul. This is seen in Andrea Pisano, who, practising\r\nsculpture in the time of Giotto, made so great improvement in this art,\r\nthat both in practice and in theory he was esteemed the greatest man\r\nthat the Tuscans had had up to his times in this profession, and above\r\nall in casting in bronze. Wherefore his works were honoured and rewarded\r\nin such a manner by all who knew him, and above all by the Florentines,\r\nthat it was no hardship to him to change country, relatives, property\r\nand friends. He received much assistance from the difficulties\r\nexperienced in sculpture by the masters who had lived before him, whose\r\nsculptures were so uncouth and worthless that whosoever saw them in\r\ncomparison with those of this man judged the last a miracle. And that\r\nthese early works were rude, witness is borne, as it has been said\r\nelsewhere, by some that are over the principal door of S. Paolo in\r\nFlorence and some in stone that are in the Church of Ognissanti, which\r\nare so made that they move those who view them rather to laughter than\r\nto any marvel or pleasure. And it is certain that the art of sculpture\r\ncan recover itself much better, in the event of the essence of statuary\r\nbeing lost (since men have the living and the natural model, which is\r\nwholly rounded, as that art requires), than can the art of painting; it\r\nbeing not so easy and simple to recover the beautiful outlines and the\r\ngood manner, in order to bring the art to the light, for these are the\r\nelements that produce majesty, beauty, grace and adornment in the works\r\nthat the painters make. In one respect fortune was favourable to the\r\nlabours of Andrea, because there had been brought to Pisa, as it has\r\nbeen said elsewhere, by means of the many victories that the Pisans had\r\nat sea, many antiquities and sarcophagi that are still round the Duomo\r\nand the Campo Santo, and these brought him such great assistance and\r\ngave him such great light as could not be obtained by Giotto, for the\r\nreason that the ancient paintings had not been preserved as much as the\r\nsculptures. And although statues are often destroyed by fires and by the\r\nruin and fury of war, and buried or transported to diverse places,\r\nnevertheless it is easy for the experienced to recognize the difference\r\nin the manner of all countries; as, for example, the Egyptian is slender\r\nand lengthy in its figures, the Greek is scientific and shows much study\r\nin the nudes, while the heads have almost all the same expression, and\r\nthe most ancient Tuscan is laboured in the hair and somewhat uncouth.\r\nThat of the Romans (I call Romans, for the most part, those who, after\r\nthe subjugation of Greece, betook themselves to Rome, whither all that\r\nthere was of the good and of the beautiful in the world was\r\ncarried)--that, I say, is so beautiful, by reason of the expressions,\r\nthe attitudes, and the movements both of the nude and of the draped\r\nfigures, that it may be said that they wrested the beautiful from all\r\nthe other provinces and moulded it into one single manner, to the end\r\nthat it might be, as it is, the best--nay, the most divine of all.\r\n\r\nAll these beautiful manners and arts being spent in the time of Andrea,\r\nthat alone was in use which had been brought by the Goths and by the\r\nuncivilized Greeks into Tuscany. Wherefore he, having studied the new\r\nmethod of design of Giotto and those few antiquities that were known to\r\nhim, refined in great part the grossness of so miserable a manner with\r\nhis judgment, in such wise that he began to work better and to give much\r\ngreater beauty to statuary than any other had yet done in that art up to\r\nhis times. Therefore, his genius and his good skill and dexterity\r\nbecoming known, he was assisted by many in his country, and while still\r\nyoung he was commissioned to make for S. Maria a Ponte some little\r\nfigures in marble, which brought him so good a name that he was sought\r\nout with very great insistence to come to work in Florence for the\r\nOffice of Works of S. Maria del Fiore, which, after a beginning had been\r\nmade with the facade containing the three doors, was suffering from a\r\ndearth of masters to make the scenes that Giotto had designed for the\r\nbeginning of the said fabric. Andrea, then, betook himself to Florence,\r\nfor the service of the said Office of Works. And because the Florentines\r\ndesired at that time to gain the friendship and love of Pope Boniface\r\nVIII, who was then Supreme Pontiff of the Church of God, they wished\r\nthat, before anything else, Andrea should make a portrait in marble of\r\nthe said Pontiff, from the life. Wherefore, putting his hand to this\r\nwork, he did not rest until he had finished the figure of the Pope, with\r\na S. Peter and a S. Paul who are one on either side of him; which three\r\nfigures were placed in the facade of S. Maria del Fiore, where they\r\nstill are. Andrea then made certain little figures of prophets for the\r\nmiddle door of the said church, in some shrines or rather niches, from\r\nwhich it is seen that he had brought great betterment to the art, and\r\nthat he was in advance, both in excellence and design, of all those who\r\nhad worked up to then on the said fabric. Wherefore it was resolved that\r\nall the works of importance should be given to him to do, and not to\r\nothers; and so, no long time after, he was commissioned to make the four\r\nstatues of the principal Doctors of the Church, S. Jerome, S. Ambrose,\r\nS. Augustine, and S. Gregory. And these being finished and acquiring for\r\nhim favour and fame with the Wardens of Works--nay, with the whole\r\ncity--he was commissioned to make two other figures in marble of the\r\nsame size, which were S. Stephen and S. Laurence, now standing in the\r\nsaid facade of S. Maria del Fiore, at the outermost corners. By the hand\r\nof Andrea, likewise, is the Madonna in marble, three braccia and a half\r\nhigh, with the Child in her arms, which stands on the altar of the\r\nlittle Church of the Company of the Misericordia, on the Piazza di S.\r\nGiovanni in Florence; which was a work much praised in those times, and\r\nabove all because he accompanied it with two angels, one on either side,\r\neach two braccia and a half high. Round this work there has been made in\r\nour own day a frame of wood, very well wrought by Maestro Antonio,\r\ncalled Il Carota; and below, a predella full of most beautiful figures\r\ncoloured in oil by Ridolfo, son of Domenico Ghirlandajo. In like\r\nmanner, that half-length Madonna in marble that is over the side door of\r\nthe same Misericordia, in the facade of the Cialdonai, is by the hand of\r\nAndrea, and it was much praised, because he imitated therein the good\r\nancient manner, contrary to his wont, which was ever far distant from\r\nit, as some drawings testify that are in our book, wrought by his hand,\r\nwherein are drawn all the stories of the Apocalypse.\r\n\r\nNow, seeing that Andrea had applied himself in his youth to the study of\r\narchitecture, there came occasion for him to be employed in this by the\r\nCommune of Florence; for Arnolfo being dead and Giotto absent, he was\r\ncommissioned to make the design of the Castle of Scarperia, which is in\r\nthe Mugello, at the foot of the mountains. Some say, although I would\r\nnot indeed vouch for it as true, that Andrea stayed a year in Venice,\r\nand there wrought, in sculpture, some little figures in marble that are\r\nin the facade of S. Marco, and that at the time of Messer Piero\r\nGradenigo, Doge of that Republic, he made the design of the Arsenal; but\r\nseeing that I know nothing about it save that which I find to have been\r\nwritten by some without authority, I leave each one to think in his own\r\nway about this matter. Andrea having returned from Venice to Florence,\r\nthe city, fearful of the coming of the Emperor, caused a part of the\r\nwalls to be raised with lime post-haste to the height of eight braccia,\r\nemploying in this Andrea, in that portion that is between San Gallo and\r\nthe Porta al Prato; and in other places he made bastions, stockades, and\r\nother ramparts of earth and of wood, very strong.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nSALOME AND THE BEHEADING OF S. JOHN THE BAPTIST\r\n\r\n(_Details, after_ Andrea Pisano, _from the Gates of the Baptistery,\r\nFlorence_)]\r\n\r\nNow because, three years before, he had shown himself to his own great\r\ncredit to be an able man in the casting of bronze, having sent to the\r\nPope in Avignon, by means of Giotto, his very great friend, who was then\r\nstaying at that Court, a very beautiful cross cast in bronze, he was\r\ncommissioned to complete in bronze one of the doors of the Church of S.\r\nGiovanni, for which Giotto had already made a very beautiful design;\r\nthis was given to him, I say, to complete, by reason of his having been\r\njudged, among so many who had worked up to then, the most able, the most\r\npractised and the most judicious master not only of Tuscany but of\r\nall Italy. Wherefore, putting his hand to this, with a mind determined\r\nnot to consent to spare either time, or labour, or diligence in\r\nexecuting a work of so great importance, fortune was so propitious to\r\nhim in the casting, for those times when the secrets were not known that\r\nare known to-day, that within the space of twenty-two years he brought\r\nit to that perfection which is seen; and what is more, he also made\r\nduring that same time not only the shrine of the high-altar of S.\r\nGiovanni, with two angels, one on either side of it, that were held\r\nsomething very beautiful, but also, after the design of Giotto, those\r\nlittle figures in marble that act as adornment for the door of the\r\nCampanile of S. Maria del Fiore, and round the same Campanile, in\r\ncertain mandorle, the seven planets, the seven virtues, and the seven\r\nworks of mercy, little figures in half-relief that were then much\r\npraised. He also made during the same time the three figures, each four\r\nbraccia high, that were set up in the niches of the said Campanile,\r\nbeneath the windows that face the spot where the Orphans now are--that\r\nis, towards the south; which figures were thought at that time more than\r\npassing good. But to return to where I left off: I say that in the said\r\nbronze door are little scenes in low relief of the life of S. John the\r\nBaptist, that is, from his birth up to his death, wrought happily and\r\nwith much diligence. And although it seems to many that in these scenes\r\nthere do not appear that beautiful design and that great art which are\r\nnow put into figures, yet Andrea deserves nothing but the greatest\r\npraise, in that he was the first to put his hand to the complete\r\nexecution of such a work, which afterwards enabled the others who lived\r\nafter him to make whatever of the beautiful, of the difficult and of the\r\ngood is to be seen at the present day in the other two doors and in the\r\nexternal ornaments. This work was placed in the middle door of that\r\nchurch, and stood there until the time when Lorenzo Ghiberti made that\r\none which is there at the present day; for then it was removed and\r\nplaced opposite the Misericordia, where it still stands. I will not\r\nforbear to say that Andrea was assisted in making this door by Nino, his\r\nson, who was afterwards a much better master than his father had been,\r\nand that it was completely finished in the year 1339, that is, not only\r\nmade smooth and polished all over, but also gilded by fire; and it is\r\nbelieved that it was cast in metal by some Venetian masters, very expert\r\nin the founding of metals, and of this there is found record in the\r\nbooks of the Guild of the Merchants of Calimara, Wardens of the Works of\r\nS. Giovanni.\r\n\r\nWhile the said door was making, Andrea made not only the other works\r\naforesaid but also many others, and in particular the model of the\r\nChurch of S. Giovanni at Pistoia, which was founded in the year 1337. In\r\nthat same year, on January 25, in excavating the foundations of this\r\nchurch, there was found the body of the Blessed Atto, once Bishop of\r\nthat city, who had been buried in that place one hundred and\r\nthirty-seven years. The architecture, then, of this church, which is\r\nround, was passing good for those times. In the principal church of the\r\nsaid city of Pistoia there is also a tomb of marble by the hand of\r\nAndrea, with the body of the sarcophagus full of little figures, and\r\nsome larger figures above; in which tomb is laid to rest the body of\r\nMesser Cino d' Angibolgi, Doctor of Laws, and a very famous scholar in\r\nhis time, as Messer Francesco Petrarca testifies in that sonnet:\r\n\r\n     Piangete, donne, e con voi pianga Amore;\r\n\r\nand also in the fourth chapter of the _Triumph of Love_, where he says:\r\n\r\n     Ecco Cin da Pistoia, Guitton d'Arezzo,\r\n     Che di non esser primo par ch'ira aggia.\r\n\r\nIn that tomb there is seen the portrait of Messer Cino himself in\r\nmarble, by the hand of Andrea; he is teaching a number of his scholars,\r\nwho are round him, with an attitude and manner so beautiful that,\r\nalthough to-day it might not be prized, in those days it must have been\r\na marvellous thing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nTHE CREATION OF MAN\r\n\r\n(_After a relief, by_ Andrea Pisano, _on the Campanile, Florence_)]\r\n\r\nAndrea was also made use of in matters of architecture by Gualtieri,\r\nDuke of Athens and Tyrant of the Florentines, who made him enlarge the\r\nsquare, and caused him, in order to safeguard himself in his palace, to\r\nsecure all the lower windows on the first floor (where to-day is the\r\nSala de' Dugento) with iron bars, square and very strong. The said Duke\r\nalso added, opposite S. Pietro Scheraggio, the walls of rustic work\r\nthat are beside the palace, in order to enlarge it; and in the thickness\r\nof the wall he made a secret staircase, in order to ascend and descend\r\nunseen. And at the foot of the said wall of rustic work he made a great\r\ndoor, which serves to-day for the Customs-house, and above that his\r\narms, and all with the design and counsel of Andrea; and although these\r\narms were chiselled out by the Council of Twelve, which took pains to\r\nefface every memorial of that Duke, there remained none the less in the\r\nsquare shield the form of the lion rampant with two tails, as anyone can\r\nsee who examines it with diligence. For the same Duke Andrea built many\r\ntowers round the walls of the city, and he not only made a magnificent\r\nbeginning for the Porta a S. Friano and brought it to the completion\r\nthat is seen, but also made the walls for the vestibules of all the\r\ngates of the city, and the lesser gates for the convenience of the\r\npeople. And because the Duke had it in his mind to make a fortress on\r\nthe Costa di S. Giorgio, Andrea made the model for it, which afterwards\r\nwas not used, for the reason that the work was never given a beginning,\r\nthe Duke having been driven out in the year 1343. Nevertheless, there\r\nwas effected in great part the desire of that Duke to bring the palace\r\nto the form of a strong castle, because, to that which had been made\r\noriginally, he added the great mass which is seen to-day, enclosing\r\nwithin its circuit the houses of the Filipetri, the tower and the houses\r\nof the Amidei and Mancini, and those of the Bellalberti. And because,\r\nhaving made a beginning with so great a fabric and with the thick walls\r\nand barbicans, he had not all the material that was essential equally in\r\nreadiness, he held back the construction of the Ponte Vecchio, which was\r\nbeing worked on with all haste as a work of necessity, and availed\r\nhimself of the stone hewn and the wood prepared for it, without the\r\nleast scruple. And although Taddeo Gaddi was not perhaps inferior in the\r\nmatters of architecture to Andrea Pisano, the Duke would not avail\r\nhimself of him in these buildings, by reason of his being a Florentine,\r\nbut only of Andrea. The same Duke Gualtieri wished to pull down S.\r\nCecilia, in order to see from his palace the Strada Romana and the\r\nMercato Nuovo, and likewise to destroy S. Pietro Scheraggio for his own\r\nconvenience, but he had not leave to do this from the Pope; and\r\nmeanwhile, as it has been said above, he was driven out by the fury of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nDeservedly then did Andrea gain, by the honourable labours of so many\r\nyears, not only very great rewards but also the citizenship; for he was\r\nmade a citizen of Florence by the Signoria, and was given offices and\r\nmagistracies in the city, and his works were esteemed both while he\r\nlived and after his death, there being found no one who could surpass\r\nhim in working, until there came Niccolo Aretino, Jacopo della Quercia\r\nof Siena, Donatello, Filippo di Ser Brunellesco, and Lorenzo Ghiberti,\r\nwho executed the sculptures and other works that they made in such a\r\nmanner that people recognized in how great error they had lived up to\r\nthat time; for these men recovered with their works that excellence\r\nwhich had been hidden and little known by men for many and many a year.\r\nThe works of Andrea date about the year of our salvation 1340.\r\n\r\nAndrea left many disciples; among others, Tommaso Pisano, architect and\r\nsculptor, who finished the Chapel of the Campo Santo and added the\r\nfinishing touch to the Campanile of the Duomo--namely, that final part\r\nwherein are the bells. Tommaso is believed to have been the son of\r\nAndrea, this being found written in the panel of the high-altar of S.\r\nFrancesco in Pisa, wherein there is, carved in half-relief, a Madonna,\r\nwith other Saints made by him, and below these his name and that of his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nMADONNA AND CHILD\r\n\r\n(_After_ Nino Pisano. _Orvieto: Museo dell'Opera_)]\r\n\r\nAndrea was survived by Nino, his son, who applied himself to sculpture;\r\nand his first work was in S. Maria Novella, where he finished a Madonna\r\nin marble begun by his father, which is within the side door, beside the\r\nChapel of the Minerbetti. Next, having gone to Pisa, he made in the\r\nSpina a half-length figure in marble of Our Lady, who is suckling an\r\ninfant Jesus Christ wrapped in certain delicate draperies. For this\r\nMadonna an ornamental frame of marble was made in the year 1522, by the\r\nagency of Messer Jacopo Corbini, and another frame, much greater and\r\nmore beautiful, was made then for another Madonna of marble, which was\r\nof full length and by the hand of the same Nino; in the attitude of\r\nwhich Madonna the mother is seen handing a rose with much grace to her\r\nSon, who is taking it in a childlike manner, so beautiful that it may\r\nbe said that Nino was beginning to rob the stone of its hardness and to\r\nreduce it to the softness of flesh, giving it lustre by means of the\r\nhighest polish. This figure is between a S. John and a S. Peter in\r\nmarble, the head of the latter being a portrait of Andrea from the life.\r\nBesides this, for an altar in S. Caterina, also in Pisa, Nino made two\r\nstatues of marble--that is, a Madonna, and an Angel who is bringing her\r\nthe Annunciation, wrought, like his other works, with so great diligence\r\nthat it can be said that they are the best that were made in those\r\ntimes. Below this Madonna receiving the Annunciation Nino carved these\r\nwords on the base: ON THE FIRST DAY OF FEBRUARY, 1370; and below the\r\nAngel: THESE FIGURES NINO MADE, THE SON OF ANDREA PISANO. He also made\r\nother works in that city and in Naples, whereof it is not needful to\r\nmake mention.\r\n\r\nAndrea died at the age of seventy-five, in the year 1345, and was buried\r\nby Nino in S. Maria del Fiore, with this epitaph:\r\n\r\n     INGENTI ANDREAS JACET HIC PISANUS IN URNA,\r\n     MARMORE QUI POTUIT SPIRANTES DUCERE VULTUS,\r\n     ET SIMULACRA DEUM MEDIIS IMPONERE TEMPLIS\r\n     EX AERE, EX AURO CANDENTI, ET PULCRO ELEPHANTO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUONAMICO BUFFALMACCO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF BUONAMICO BUFFALMACCO,\r\n\r\nPAINTER OF FLORENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nBuonamico di Cristofano, called Buffalmacco, painter of Florence, who\r\nwas a disciple of Andrea Tafi, and celebrated for his jokes by Messer\r\nGiovanni Boccaccio in his _Decameron_, was, as is known, a very dear\r\ncompanion of Bruno and Calandrino, painters equally humorous and gay;\r\nand as may be seen in his works, scattered throughout all Tuscany, he\r\nwas a man of passing good judgment in his art of painting. Franco\r\nSacchetti relates in his three hundred Stories (to begin with the things\r\nthat this man did while still youthful), that Buffalmacco lived, while\r\nhe was a lad, with Andrea, and that this master of his used to make it a\r\ncustom, when the nights were long, to get up before daylight to labour,\r\nand to call the lads to night-work. This being displeasing to Buonamico,\r\nwho was made to rise out of his soundest sleep, he began to think of\r\nfinding a way whereby Andrea might give up rising so much before\r\ndaylight to work, and he succeeded; for having found thirty large\r\ncockroaches, or rather blackbeetles, in a badly swept cellar, with\r\ncertain fine and short needles he fixed a little taper on the back of\r\neach of the said cockroaches, and, the hour coming when Andrea was wont\r\nto rise, he lit the tapers and put the animals one by one into the room\r\nof Andrea, through a chink in the door. He, awaking at the very hour\r\nwhen he was wont to call Buffalmacco, and seeing those little lights,\r\nall full of fear began to tremble and in great terror to recommend\r\nhimself under his breath to God, like the old gaffer that he was, and to\r\nsay his prayers or psalms; and finally, putting his head below the\r\nbedclothes, he made no attempt for that night to call Buffalmacco, but\r\nstayed as he was, ever trembling with fear, up to daylight. In the\r\nmorning, then, having risen, he asked Buonamico if he had seen, as he\r\nhad himself, more than a thousand demons; whereupon Buonamico said he\r\nhad not, because he had kept his eyes closed, and was marvelling that he\r\nhad not been called to night-work. \"To night-work!\" said Tafo, \"I have\r\nhad something else to think of besides painting, and I am resolved at\r\nall costs to go and live in another house.\" The following night,\r\nalthough Buonamico put only three of them into the said room of Tafo,\r\nnone the less, what with terror of the past night and of those few\r\ndevils that he saw, he slept not a wink; nay, no sooner was it daylight\r\nthan he rushed from the house, meaning never to return, and a great\r\nbusiness it was to make him change his mind. At last Buonamico brought\r\nthe parish priest, who consoled him the best that he could. Later, Tafo\r\nand Buonamico discoursing over the affair, Buonamico said: \"I have ever\r\nheard tell that the greatest enemies of God are the demons, and that in\r\nconsequence they must also be the most capital adversaries of painters;\r\nbecause, besides that we make them ever most hideous, what is worse, we\r\nnever attend to aught else than to making saints, male and female, on\r\nwalls and panels, and to making men more devout and more upright\r\nthereby, to the despite of the demons; wherefore, these demons having a\r\ngrudge against us for this, as beings that have greater power by night\r\nthan by day they come and play us these tricks, and worse tricks will\r\nthey play if this use of rising for night-work is not given up\r\ncompletely.\" With these and many other speeches Buffalmacco knew so well\r\nhow to manage the business, being borne out by what Sir Priest kept\r\nsaying, that Tafo gave over rising for night-work, and the devils ceased\r\ngoing through the house at night with little lights. But Tafo beginning\r\nagain, for the love of gain, not many months afterwards, having almost\r\nforgotten all fear, to rise once more to work in the night and to call\r\nBuffalmacco, the cockroaches too began again to wander about; wherefore\r\nhe was forced by fear to give up the habit entirely, being above all\r\nadvised to do this by the priest. Afterwards this affair, spreading\r\nthroughout the city, brought it about that for a time neither Tafo nor\r\nother painters made a practice of rising to work at night. Later, and no\r\nlong time after this, Buffalmacco, having become a passing good master,\r\ntook leave of Tafo, as the same Franco relates, and began to work for\r\nhimself; and he never lacked for something to do.\r\n\r\nNow, Buffalmacco having taken a house, to work in and to live in as\r\nwell, that had next door a passing rich woolworker, who, being a\r\nsimpleton, was called Capodoca (Goosehead), the wife of this man would\r\nrise every night very early, precisely when Buffalmacco, having up to\r\nthen been working, would go to lie down; and sitting at her wheel, which\r\nby misadventure she had planted opposite to the bed of Buffalmacco, she\r\nwould spend the whole night spinning her thread; wherefore Buonamico,\r\nbeing able to get scarce a wink of sleep, began to think and think how\r\nhe could remedy this nuisance. Nor was it long before he noticed that\r\nbehind a wall of brickwork, that divided his house from Capodoca's, was\r\nthe hearth of his uncomfortable neighbour, and that through a hole it\r\nwas possible to see what she was doing over the fire. Having therefore\r\nthought of a new trick, he bored a hole with a long gimlet through a\r\ncane, and, watching for a moment when the wife of Capodoca was not at\r\nthe fire, he pushed it more than once through the aforesaid hole in the\r\nwall and put as much salt as he wished into his neighbour's pot;\r\nwherefore Capodoca, returning either for dinner or for supper, more\r\noften than not could not eat or even taste either broth or meat, so\r\nbitter was everything through the great quantity of salt. For once or\r\ntwice he had patience and only made a little noise about it; but after\r\nhe saw that words were not enough, he gave blows many a time for this to\r\nthe poor woman, who was in despair, it appearing to her that she was\r\nmore than careful in salting her cooking. She, one time among others\r\nthat her husband was beating her for this, began to try to excuse\r\nherself, wherefore Capodoca, falling into even greater rage, set himself\r\nto thrash her again in a manner that the woman screamed with all her\r\nmight, and the whole neighbourhood ran up at the noise; and among others\r\nthere came up Buffalmacco, who, having heard of what Capodoca was\r\naccusing his wife and in what way she was excusing herself, said to\r\nCapodoca: \"I' faith, comrade, this calls for a little reason; thou dost\r\ncomplain that the pot, morning and evening, is too much salted, and I\r\nmarvel that this good woman of thine can do anything well. I, for my\r\npart, know not how, by day, she keeps on her feet, considering that the\r\nwhole night she sits up over that wheel of hers, and sleeps not, to my\r\nbelief, an hour. Make her give up this rising at midnight, and thou wilt\r\nsee that, having her fill of sleep, she will have her wits about her by\r\nday and will not fall into such blunders.\" Then, turning to the other\r\nneighbours, he convinced them so well of the grave import of the matter,\r\nthat they all said to Capodoca that Buonamico was speaking the truth and\r\nthat it must be done as he advised. He, therefore, believing that it was\r\nso, commanded her not to rise in the night, and the pot was then\r\nreasonably salted, save when perchance the woman on occasion rose early,\r\nfor then Buffalmacco would return to his remedy, which finally brought\r\nit about that Capodoca made her give it up completely.\r\n\r\nBuffalmacco, then, among the first works that he made, painted with his\r\nown hand the whole church of the Convent of the Nuns of Faenza, which\r\nstood in Florence on the site of the present Cittadella del Prato; and\r\namong other scenes that he made there from the life of Christ, in all\r\nwhich he acquitted himself very well, he made the Massacre that Herod\r\nordained of the Innocents, wherein he expressed very vividly the\r\nemotions both of the murderers and of the other figures; for in some\r\nnurses and mothers who are snatching the infants from the hands of the\r\nmurderers and are seeking all the assistance that they can from their\r\nhands, their nails, their teeth, and every movement of the body, there\r\nis shown on the surface a heart no less full of rage and fury than of\r\nwoe.\r\n\r\nOf this work, that convent being to-day in ruins, there is to be seen\r\nnothing but a coloured sketch in our book of drawings by diverse\r\nmasters, wherein there is this scene drawn by the hand of Buonamico\r\nhimself. In the doing of this work for the aforesaid Nuns of Faenza,\r\nseeing that Buffalmacco was a person very eccentric and careless both in\r\ndress and in manner of life, it came to pass, since he did not always\r\nwear his cap and his mantle, as in those times it was the custom to do,\r\nthat the nuns, seeing him once through the screen that he had caused to\r\nbe made, began to say to the steward that it did not please them to see\r\nhim in that guise, in his jerkin; however, appeased by him, they stayed\r\nfor a little without saying more. But at last, seeing him ever in the\r\nsame guise, and doubting whether he was not some knavish boy for\r\ngrinding colours, they had him told by the Abbess that they would have\r\nliked to see the master at work, and not always him. To which Buonamico\r\nanswered, like the good fellow that he was, that as soon as the master\r\nwas there, he would let them know; taking notice, none the less, of the\r\nlittle confidence that they had in him. Taking a stool, therefore, and\r\nplacing another above it, he put on top of all a pitcher, or rather a\r\nwater-jar, and on the mouth of that he put a cap, hanging over the\r\nhandle, and then he covered the rest of the jar with a burgher's mantle,\r\nand finally, putting a brush in suitable fashion into the spout through\r\nwhich the water is poured, he went off. The nuns, returning to see the\r\nwork through an opening where the cloth had slipped, saw the\r\nsupposititious master in full canonicals; wherefore, believing that he\r\nwas working might and main and was by way of doing different work from\r\nthat which the untidy knave was doing, they left it at that for some\r\ndays, without thinking more about it. Finally, having grown desirous to\r\nsee what beautiful work the master had done, fifteen days having passed,\r\nduring which space of time Buonamico had never come near the place, one\r\nnight, thinking that the master was not there, they went to see his\r\npaintings, and remained all confused and blushing by reason of one\r\nbolder than the rest discovering the solemn master, who in fifteen days\r\nhad done not one stroke of work. Then, recognizing that he had served\r\nthem as they merited and that the works that he had made were worthy of\r\nnothing but praise, they bade the steward recall Buonamico, who, with\r\nthe greatest laughter and delight, returned to the work, having given\r\nthem to know what difference there is between men and pitchers, and that\r\nit is not always by their clothes that the works of men should be\r\njudged. In a few days, then, he finished a scene wherewith they were\r\nmuch contented, it appearing to them to be in every way satisfactory,\r\nexcept that the figures appeared to them rather wan and pallid than\r\notherwise in the flesh-tints. Buonamico, hearing this, and having learnt\r\nthat the Abbess had some Vernaccia, the best in Florence, which was used\r\nfor the holy office of the Mass, said to them that in order to remedy\r\nthis defect nothing else could be done but to temper the colours with\r\nsome good Vernaccia; because, touching the cheeks and the rest of the\r\nflesh on the figures with colours thus tempered, they would become rosy\r\nand coloured in most lifelike fashion. Hearing this, the good sisters,\r\nwho believed it all, kept him ever afterwards furnished with the best\r\nVernaccia, as long as the work lasted; and he, rejoicing in it, from\r\nthat time onwards made the figures fresher and more highly coloured with\r\nhis ordinary colours.\r\n\r\nThis work finished, he painted some stories of S. James in the Abbey of\r\nSettimo, in the chapel that is in the cloister, and dedicated to that\r\nSaint, on the vaulting of which he made the four Patriarchs and the four\r\nEvangelists, among whom S. Luke is doing a striking action in blowing\r\nvery naturally on his pen, in order that it may yield its ink. Next, in\r\nthe scenes on the walls, which are five, there are seen beautiful\r\nattitudes in the figures, and the whole work is executed with invention\r\nand judgment. And because Buonamico was wont, in order to make his\r\nflesh-colour better, as is seen in this work, to make a ground of\r\npurple, which in time produces a salt that becomes corroded and eats\r\naway the white and other colours, it is no marvel if this work is spoilt\r\nand eaten away, whereas many others that were made long before have been\r\nvery well preserved. And I, who thought formerly that these pictures had\r\nreceived injury from the damp, have since proved by experience, studying\r\nother works of the same man, that it is not from the damp but from this\r\nparticular use of Buffalmacco's that they have become spoilt so\r\ncompletely that there is not seen in them either design or anything\r\nelse, and that where the flesh-colours were there has remained nothing\r\nelse but the purple. This method of working should be used by no one who\r\nis anxious that his pictures should have long life.\r\n\r\nBuonamico wrought, after that which has been described above, two panels\r\nin distemper for the Monks of the Certosa of Florence, whereof one is\r\nwhere the books of chants are kept for the use of the choir, and the\r\nother below in the old chapels. He painted in fresco the Chapel of the\r\nGiochi and Bastari in the Badia of Florence, beside the principal\r\nchapel; which chapel, although afterwards it was conceded to the family\r\nof the Boscoli, retains the said pictures of Buffalmacco up to our own\r\nday. In these he made the Passion of Christ, with effects ingenious and\r\nbeautiful, showing very great humility and sweetness in Christ, who is\r\nwashing the feet of His Disciples, and ferocity and cruelty in the Jews,\r\nwho are leading Him to Herod. But he showed talent and facility more\r\nparticularly in a Pilate, whom he painted in prison, and in Judas\r\nhanging from a tree; wherefore it is easy to believe what is told about\r\nthis gay painter--namely, that when he thought fit to use diligence and\r\nto take pains, which rarely came to pass, he was not inferior to any\r\npainter whatsoever of his times. And to show that this is true, the\r\nworks in fresco that he made in Ognissanti, where to-day there is the\r\ncemetery, were wrought with so much diligence and with so many\r\nprecautions, that the water which has rained over them for so many years\r\nhas not been able to spoil them or to prevent their excellence from\r\nbeing recognized, and that they have been preserved very well, because\r\nthey were wrought purely on the fresh plaster. On the walls, then, are\r\nthe Nativity of Jesus Christ and the Adoration of the Magi--that is,\r\nover the tomb of the Aliotti. After this work Buonamico, having gone to\r\nBologna, wrought some scenes in fresco in S. Petronio, in the Chapel of\r\nthe Bolognini--that is, on the vaulting; but by reason of some accident,\r\nI know not what, supervening, he did not finish them.\r\n\r\nIt is said that in the year 1302 he was summoned to Assisi, and that in\r\nthe Church of S. Francesco, in the Chapel of S. Caterina, he painted all\r\nthe stories of her life in fresco, which have been very well preserved;\r\nand there are therein some figures that are worthy to be praised. This\r\nchapel finished, on his passing through Arezzo, Bishop Guido, by reason\r\nof having heard that Buonamico was a gay fellow and an able painter,\r\ndesired him to stop in that city and paint for him, in the Vescovado,\r\nthe chapel where baptisms are now held. Buonamico, having put his hand\r\nto the work, had already done a good part of it when there befell him\r\nthe strangest experience in the world, which was, according to what\r\nFranco Sacchetti relates, as follows. The Bishop had an ape, the\r\ndrollest and the most mischievous that there had ever been. This animal,\r\nstanding once on the scaffolding to watch Buonamico at work, had given\r\nattention to everything, and had never taken his eyes off him when he\r\nwas mixing the colours, handling the flasks, beating the eggs for making\r\nthe distempers, and in short when he was doing anything else\r\nwhatsoever. Now, Buonamico having left off working one Saturday evening,\r\non the Sunday morning this ape, notwithstanding that he had, fastened to\r\nhis feet, a great block of wood which the Bishop made him carry in order\r\nthat thus he might not be able to leap wherever he liked, climbed on to\r\nthe scaffolding whereon Buonamico was used to stand to work, in spite of\r\nthe very great weight of the block of wood; and there, seizing the\r\nflasks with his hands, pouring them one into another and making six\r\nmixtures, and beating up whatever eggs there were, he began to daub over\r\nwith the brushes all the figures there, and, persevering in this\r\nperformance, did not cease until he had repainted everything with his\r\nown hand; and this done, he again made a mixture of all the colours that\r\nwere left him, although they were but few, and, getting down from the\r\nscaffolding, went off. Monday morning having come, Buonamico returned to\r\nhis work, where, seeing the figures spoilt, the flasks all mixed up, and\r\neverything upside down, he stood all in marvel and confusion. Then,\r\nhaving pondered much in his own mind, he concluded finally that some\r\nAretine had done this, through envy or through some other reason;\r\nwherefore, having gone to the Bishop, he told him how the matter stood\r\nand what he suspected, whereat the Bishop became very much disturbed,\r\nbut, consoling Buonamico, desired him to put his hand again to the work\r\nand to repaint all that was spoilt. And because the Bishop had put faith\r\nin his words, which had something of the probable, he gave him six of\r\nhis men-at-arms, who should stand in hiding with halberds while he was\r\nnot at work, and, if anyone came, should cut him to pieces without\r\nmercy. The figures, then, having been painted over again, one day that\r\nthe soldiers were in hiding, lo and behold! they hear a certain rumbling\r\nthrough the church, and a little while after the ape climbing on to the\r\nscaffolding; and in the twinkling of an eye, the mixtures made, they see\r\nthe new master set himself to work over the saints of Buonamico. Calling\r\nhim, therefore, and showing him the culprit, and standing with him to\r\nwatch the beast at his work, they were all like to burst with laughter;\r\nand Buonamico in particular, for all that he was vexed thereby, could\r\nnot keep from laughing till the tears came. Finally, dismissing the\r\nsoldiers who had mounted guard with their halberds, he went off to the\r\nBishop and said to him: \"My lord, you wish the painting to be done in\r\none fashion, and your ape wishes it done in another.\" Then, relating the\r\naffair, he added: \"There was no need for you to send for painters from\r\nelsewhere, if you had the true master at home. But he, perhaps, knew not\r\nso well how to make the mixtures; now that he knows, let him do it by\r\nhimself, since I am no more good here. And his talent being revealed, I\r\nam content that there should be nothing given to me for my work save\r\nleave to return to Florence.\" The Bishop, hearing the affair, although\r\nit vexed him, could not keep from laughing, and above all as he thought\r\nhow an animal had played a trick on him who was the greatest trickster\r\nin the world. However, after they had talked and laughed their fill over\r\nthis strange incident, the Bishop persuaded Buonamico to resume the work\r\nfor the third time, and he finished it. And the ape, as punishment and\r\npenance for the crime committed, was shut up in a great wooden cage and\r\nkept where Buonamico was working, until this work was entirely finished;\r\nand no one could imagine the contortions which that creature kept making\r\nin this cage with his face, his body, and his hands, seeing others\r\nworking and himself unable to take part.\r\n\r\nThe work in this chapel finished, the Bishop, either in jest or for some\r\nother reason known only to himself, commanded that Buffalmacco should\r\npaint him, on one wall of his palace, an eagle on the back of a lion\r\nwhich it had killed. The crafty painter, having promised to do all that\r\nthe Bishop wished, had a good scaffolding made of planks, saying that he\r\nrefused to be seen painting such a thing. This made, shutting himself up\r\nalone inside it, he painted, contrary to what the Bishop wished, a lion\r\nthat was tearing to pieces an eagle; and, the work finished, he sought\r\nleave from the Bishop to go to Florence in order to get some colours\r\nthat he was wanting. And so, locking the scaffolding with a key, he went\r\noff to Florence, in mind to return no more to the Bishop, who, seeing\r\nthe business dragging on and the painter not returning, had the\r\nscaffolding opened, and discovered that Buonamico had been too much for\r\nhim. Wherefore, moved by very great displeasure, he had him banished on\r\npain of death, and Buonamico, hearing this, sent to tell him to do his\r\nworst; whereupon the Bishop threatened him to a fearful tune. But\r\nfinally, remembering that he had begun the playing of tricks and that it\r\nserved him right to be tricked himself, he pardoned Buonamico for his\r\ninsult and rewarded him liberally for his labours. Nay, what is more,\r\nsummoning him again no long time after to Arezzo, he caused him to make\r\nmany works in the Duomo Vecchio, which are now destroyed, treating him\r\never as his familiar friend and very faithful servant. The same man\r\npainted the niche of the principal chapel in the Church of S. Giustino,\r\nalso in Arezzo.\r\n\r\nSome writers tell that Buonamico being in Florence and often frequenting\r\nthe shop of Maso del Saggio with his friends and companions, he was\r\nthere, with many others, arranging the festival which the men of the\r\nBorgo San Friano held on May 1 in certain boats on the Arno; and that\r\nwhen the Ponte alla Carraia, which was then of wood, collapsed by reason\r\nof the too great weight of the people who had flocked to that spectacle,\r\nhe did not die there, as many others did, because, precisely at the\r\nmoment when the bridge collapsed on to the structure that was\r\nrepresenting Hell on the boats in the Arno, he had gone to get some\r\nthings that were wanting for the festival.\r\n\r\nBeing summoned to Pisa no long time after these events, Buonamico\r\npainted many stories of the Old Testament in the Abbey of S. Paolo a\r\nRipa d'Arno, then belonging to the Monks of Vallombrosa, in both\r\ntransepts of the church, on three sides, and from the roof down to the\r\nfloor, beginning with the Creation of man, and continuing up to the\r\ncompletion of the Tower of Nimrod. In this work, although it is to-day\r\nfor the greater part spoilt, there are seen vivacity in the figures,\r\ngood skill and loveliness in the colouring, and signs to show that the\r\nhand of Buonamico could very well express the conceptions of his mind,\r\nalthough he had little power of design. On the wall of the right\r\ntransept which is opposite to that wherein is the side door, in some\r\nstories of S. Anastasia, there are seen certain ancient costumes and\r\nhead-dresses, very charming and beautiful, in some women who are painted\r\nthere with graceful manner. Not less beautiful, also, are those figures\r\nthat are in a boat, with well-conceived attitudes, among which is the\r\nportrait of Pope Alexander IV, which Buonamico had, so it is said, from\r\nTafo his master, who had portrayed that Pontiff in mosaic in S. Pietro.\r\nIn the last scene, likewise, wherein is the martyrdom of that Saint and\r\nof others, Buonamico expressed very well in the faces the fear of death\r\nand the grief and terror of those who are standing to see her tortured\r\nand put to death, while she stands bound to a tree and over the fire.\r\n\r\nA companion of Buonamico in this work was Bruno di Giovanni, a painter,\r\nwho is thus called in the old book of the Company; which Bruno (also\r\ncelebrated as a gay fellow by Boccaccio), the said scenes on the walls\r\nbeing finished, painted the altar of S. Ursula with the company of\r\nvirgins, in the same church. He made in one hand of the said Saint a\r\nstandard with the arms of Pisa, which are a white cross on a field of\r\nred, and he made her offering the other hand to a woman who, rising\r\nbetween two mountains and touching the sea with one of her feet, is\r\nstretching both her hands to her in the act of supplication; which\r\nwoman, representing Pisa, and having on her head a crown of gold and\r\nover her shoulders a mantle covered with circlets and eagles, is seeking\r\nassistance from that Saint, being much in travail in the sea. Now, for\r\nthe reason that in painting this work Bruno was bewailing that the\r\nfigures which he was making therein had not the same life as those of\r\nBuonamico, the latter, in his waggish way, in order to teach him to make\r\nhis figures not merely vivacious but actually speaking, made him paint\r\nsome words issuing from the mouth of that woman who is supplicating the\r\nSaint, and the answer of the Saint to her, a device that Buonamico had\r\nseen in the works that had been made in the same city by Cimabue. This\r\nexpedient, even as it pleased Bruno and the other thick-witted men of\r\nthose times, in like manner pleases certain boors to-day, who are served\r\ntherein by craftsmen as vulgar as themselves. And in truth it seems\r\nextraordinary that from this beginning there should have passed into use\r\na device that was employed for a jest and for no other reason, insomuch\r\nthat even a great part of the Campo Santo, wrought by masters of repute,\r\nis full of this rubbish.\r\n\r\nThe works of Buonamico, then, finding much favour with the Pisans, he\r\nwas charged by the Warden of the Works of the Campo Santo to make four\r\nscenes in fresco, from the beginning of the world up to the construction\r\nof Noah's Ark, and round the scenes an ornamental border, wherein he\r\nmade his own portrait from the life--namely, in a frieze, in the middle\r\nof which, and on the corners, are some heads, among which, as I have\r\nsaid, is seen his own, with a cap exactly like the one that is seen\r\nabove. And because in this work there is a God, who is upholding with\r\nhis arms the heavens and the elements--nay, the whole body of the\r\nuniverse--Buonamico, in order to explain his story with verses similar\r\nto the pictures of that age, wrote this sonnet in capital letters at the\r\nfoot, with his own hand, as may still be seen; which sonnet, by reason\r\nof its antiquity and of the simplicity of the language of those times,\r\nit has seemed good to me to include in this place, although in my\r\nopinion it is not likely to give much pleasure, save perchance as\r\nsomething that bears witness as to what was the knowledge of the men of\r\nthat century:\r\n\r\n     Voi che avisate questa dipintura\r\n     Di Dio pietoso, sommo creatore,\r\n     Lo qual fe' tutte cose con amore,\r\n     Pesate, numerate ed in misura;\r\n     In nove gradi angelica natura,\r\n     In ello empirio ciel pien di splendore,\r\n     Colui che non si muove ed e motore,\r\n     Ciascuna cosa fece buona e pura.\r\n     Levate gli occhi del vostro intelletto,\r\n     Considerate quanto e ordinato\r\n     Lo mondo universale; e con affetto\r\n     Lodate lui che l'ha si ben creato;\r\n     Pensate di passare a tal diletto\r\n     Tra gli Angeli, dov'e ciascun beato.\r\n     Per questo mondo si vede la gloria,\r\n     Lo basso e il mezzo e l'alto in questa storia.\r\n\r\nAnd to tell the truth, it was very courageous in Buonamico to undertake\r\nto make a God the Father five braccia high, with the hierarchies, the\r\nheavens, the angels, the zodiac, and all the things above, even to the\r\nheavenly body of the moon, and then the element of fire, the air, the\r\nearth, and finally the nether regions; and to fill up the two angles\r\nbelow he made in one, S. Augustine, and in the other, S. Thomas\r\nAquinas. At the head of the same Campo Santo, where there is now the\r\nmarble tomb of Corte, Buonamico painted the whole Passion of Christ,\r\nwith a great number of figures on foot and on horseback, and all in\r\nvaried and beautiful attitudes; and continuing the story he made the\r\nResurrection and the Apparition of Christ to the Apostles, passing well.\r\n\r\nHaving finished these works and at the same time all that he had gained\r\nPisa, which was not little, he returned to Florence as poor as he had\r\nleft it, and there he made many panels and works in fresco, whereof\r\nthere is no need to make further record. Meanwhile there had been\r\nentrusted to Bruno, his great friend (who had returned with him from\r\nPisa, where they had squandered everything), some works in S. Maria\r\nNovella, and seeing that Bruno had not much design or invention,\r\nBuonamico designed for him all that he afterwards put into execution on\r\na wall in the said church, opposite to the pulpit and as long as the\r\nspace between column and column, and that was the story of S. Maurice\r\nand his companions, who were beheaded for the faith of Jesus Christ.\r\nThis work Bruno made for Guido Campese, then Constable of the\r\nFlorentines, whose portrait he had made before he died in the year 1312;\r\nin that work he painted him in his armour, as was the custom in those\r\ntimes, and behind him he made a line of men-at-arms, armed in ancient\r\nfashion, who make a beautiful effect, while Guido himself is kneeling\r\nbefore a Madonna who has the Child Jesus in her arms, and is appearing\r\nto be recommended to her by S. Dominic and S. Agnes, who are on either\r\nside of him. Although this picture is not very beautiful, yet,\r\nconsidering the design and invention of Buonamico, it is worthy to be in\r\npart praised, and above all by reason of the costumes, helmets, and\r\nother armour of those times. And I have availed myself of it in some\r\nscenes that I have made for the Lord Duke Cosimo, wherein it was\r\nnecessary to represent men armed in ancient fashion, and other similar\r\nthings of that age; which work has greatly pleased his most Illustrious\r\nExcellency and others who have seen it. And from this it can be seen how\r\nmuch benefit may be gained from the inventions and works made by these\r\nancients, although they may not be very perfect, and in what fashion\r\nprofit and advantage can be drawn from their performances, since they\r\nopened the way for us to the marvels that have been made up to our day\r\nand are being made continually.\r\n\r\nWhile Bruno was making this work, a peasant desiring that Buonamico\r\nshould make him a S. Christopher, they came to an agreement in Florence\r\nand arranged a contract in this fashion, that the price should be eight\r\nflorins and that the figure should be twelve braccia high. Buonamico,\r\nthen, having gone to the church where he was to make the S. Christopher,\r\nfound that by reason of its not being more than nine braccia either in\r\nheight or in length, he could not, either without or within, accommodate\r\nthe figure in a manner that it might stand well; wherefore he made up\r\nhis mind, since it would not go in upright, to make it within the church\r\nlying down. But since, even so, the whole length would not go in, he was\r\nforced to bend it from the knees downwards on to the wall at the head of\r\nthe church. The work finished, the peasant would by no means pay for it;\r\nnay, he made an outcry and said he had been cozened. The matter,\r\ntherefore, going before the Justices, it was judged, according to the\r\ncontract, that Buonamico was in the right.\r\n\r\nIn S. Giovanni fra l'Arcore was a very beautiful Passion of Christ by\r\nthe hand of Buonamico, and among other things that were much praised\r\ntherein was a Judas hanging from a tree, made with much judgment and\r\nbeautiful manner. An old man, likewise, who was blowing his nose, was\r\nmost natural, and the Maries, broken with weeping, had expressions and\r\naspects so sad, that they deserved to be greatly praised, since that age\r\nhad not as yet much facility in the method of representing the emotions\r\nof the soul with the brush. On the same wall there was a good figure in\r\na S. Ivo of Brittany, who had many widows and orphans at his feet, and\r\ntwo angels in the sky, who were crowning him, were made with the\r\nsweetest manner. This edifice and the pictures together were thrown to\r\nthe ground in the year of the war of 1529.\r\n\r\nIn Cortona, also, for Messer Aldobrandino, Bishop of that city,\r\nBuonamico painted many works in the Vescovado, and in particular the\r\nchapel and panel of the high-altar; but seeing that everything was\r\nthrown to the ground in renovating the palace and the church, there is\r\nno need to make further mention of them. In S. Francesco, however, and\r\nin S. Margherita, in the same city, there are still some pictures by the\r\nhand of Buonamico. From Cortona going once more to Assisi, Buonamico\r\npainted in fresco, in the lower Church of S. Francesco, the whole Chapel\r\nof Cardinal Egidio Alvaro, a Spaniard; and because he acquitted himself\r\nvery well, he was therefore liberally rewarded by that Cardinal.\r\nFinally, Buonamico having wrought many pictures throughout the whole\r\nMarch, in returning to Florence he stopped at Perugia, and painted there\r\nin fresco the Chapel of the Buontempi in the Church of S. Domenico,\r\nmaking therein stories of the life of S. Catherine, virgin and martyr.\r\nAnd in the Church of S. Domenico Vecchio, on one wall, he painted in\r\nfresco the scene when the same Catherine, daughter of King Costa, making\r\ndisputation, is convincing and converting certain philosophers to the\r\nfaith of Christ; and seeing that this scene is more beautiful than any\r\nother that Buonamico ever made, it can be said with truth that in this\r\nwork he surpassed himself. The people of Perugia, moved by this,\r\naccording to what Franco Sacchetti writes, commanded that he should\r\npaint S. Ercolano, Bishop and Protector of that city, in the square;\r\nwherefore, having agreed about the price, on the spot where the painting\r\nwas to be done there was made a screen of planks and matting, to the end\r\nthat the master might not be seen painting; and this made, he put his\r\nhand to the work. But before ten days had passed, every passer-by asking\r\nwhen this picture would be finished, as though such works were cast in\r\nmoulds,[15] the matter disgusted Buonamico; wherefore, having come to\r\nthe end of the work and being distracted with such importunity, he\r\ndetermined within himself to take a gentle vengeance on the impatience\r\nof these people. And this came to pass, for, when the work was finished,\r\nbefore unveiling it, he let them see it, and it was entirely to their\r\nsatisfaction; but on the people of Perugia wishing to remove the screen\r\nat once, Buonamico said that for two days longer they should leave it\r\nstanding, for the reason that he wished to retouch certain parts on the\r\ndry; and so it was done. Buonamico, then, having mounted the\r\nscaffolding, removed the great diadem of gold that he had given to the\r\nSaint, raised in relief with plaster, as was the custom in those times,\r\nand made him a crown, or rather garland, right round his head, of\r\nroaches; and this done, one morning he settled with his host and went\r\noff to Florence. Now, two days having passed, the people of Perugia, not\r\nseeing the painter going about as they had been used, asked the host\r\nwhat had become of him, and, hearing that he had returned to Florence,\r\nwent at once to remove the screen; and finding their S. Ercolano crowned\r\nsolemnly with roaches, they sent word of it immediately to their\r\ngovernors. But although these sent horsemen post-haste to look for\r\nBuonamico, it was all in vain, seeing that he had returned in great\r\nhaste to Florence. Having determined, then, to make a painter of their\r\nown remove the crown of roaches and restore the diadem to the Saint,\r\nthey said all the evil that can be imagined about Buonamico and the rest\r\nof the Florentines.\r\n\r\nBuonamico, back in Florence and caring little about what the people of\r\nPerugia might say, set to work and made many paintings, whereof, in\r\norder not to be too long, there is no need to make mention. I will say\r\nonly this, that having painted in fresco at Calcinaia a Madonna with the\r\nChild in her arms, he who had charged him to do it, in place of paying\r\nhim, gave him words; whence Buonamico, who was not used to being trifled\r\nwith or being fooled, determined to get his due by hook or by crook. And\r\nso, having gone one morning to Calcinaia, he transformed the child that\r\nhe had painted in the arms of the Virgin into a little bear, but in\r\ncolours made only with water, without size or distemper. This change\r\nbeing seen, not long after, by the peasant who had given him the work to\r\ndo, almost in despair he went to find Buonamico, praying him for the\r\nsake of Heaven to remove the little bear and to paint another child as\r\nbefore, for he was ready to make satisfaction. This the other did\r\namicably, being paid for both the first and the second labour without\r\ndelay; and for restoring the whole work a wet sponge sufficed. Finally,\r\nseeing that it would take too long were I to wish to relate all the\r\ntricks, as well as all the pictures, that Buonamico Buffalmacco made,\r\nand above all when frequenting the shop of Maso del Saggio, which was\r\nthe resort of citizens and of all the gay and mischievous spirits that\r\nthere were in Florence, I will make an end of discoursing about him.\r\n\r\nHe died at the age of seventy-eight, and being very poor and having done\r\nmore spending than earning, by reason of being such in character, he was\r\nsupported in his illness by the Company of the Misericordia in S. Maria\r\nNuova, the hospital of Florence; and then, being dead, he was buried in\r\nthe Ossa (for so they call a cloister, or rather cemetery, of the\r\nhospital), like the rest of the poor, in the year 1340. The works of\r\nthis man were prized while he lived, and since then, for works of that\r\nage, they have been ever extolled.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Proverbial expression, equivalent to our \"twinkling of an\r\neye.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMBROGIO LORENZETTI\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MADONNA AND CHILD\r\n\r\n(_After the painting by_ Ambrogio Lorenzetti. _Milan: Cagnola\r\nCollection_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF AMBROGIO LORENZETTI,\r\n\r\nPAINTER OF SIENA\r\n\r\n\r\nIf that debt is great, as without doubt it is, which craftsmen of fine\r\ngenius should acknowledge to nature, much greater should that be that is\r\ndue from us to them, seeing that they, with great solicitude, fill the\r\ncities with noble and useful buildings and with lovely historical\r\ncompositions, gaining for themselves, for the most part, fame and riches\r\nwith their works; as did Ambrogio Lorenzetti, painter of Siena, who\r\nshowed beautiful and great invention in grouping and placing his figures\r\nthoughtfully in historical scenes. That this is true is proved by a\r\nscene in the Church of the Friars Minor in Siena, painted by him very\r\ngracefully in the cloister, wherein there is represented in what manner\r\na youth becomes a friar, and how he and certain others go to the Soldan,\r\nand are there beaten and sentenced to the gallows and hanged on a tree,\r\nand finally beheaded, with the addition of a terrible tempest. In this\r\npicture, with much art and dexterity, he counterfeited in the travailing\r\nof the figures the turmoil of the air and the fury of the rain and of\r\nthe wind, wherefrom the modern masters have learnt the method and the\r\nprinciple of this invention, by reason of which, since it was unknown\r\nbefore, he deserved infinite commendation. Ambrogio was a practised\r\ncolourist in fresco, and he handled colours in distemper with great\r\ndexterity and facility, as it is still seen in the panels executed by\r\nhim in Siena for the little hospital called Mona Agnesa, where he\r\npainted and finished a scene with new and beautiful composition. And at\r\nthe great hospital, on one front, he made in fresco the Nativity of Our\r\nLady and the scene when she is going with the virgins to the Temple. For\r\nthe Friars of S. Augustine in the same city he painted their\r\nChapter-house, where the Apostles are seen represented on the vaulting,\r\nwith scrolls in their hands whereon is written that part of the Creed\r\nwhich each one of them made; and below each is a little scene containing\r\nin painting that same subject that is signified above by the writing.\r\nNear this, on the main front, are three stories of S. Catherine the\r\nmartyr, who is disputing with the tyrant in a temple, and, in the\r\nmiddle, the Passion of Christ, with the Thieves on the Cross, and the\r\nMaries below, who are supporting the Virgin Mary who has swooned; which\r\nworks were finished by him with much grace and with beautiful manner.\r\n\r\nIn a large hall of the Palazzo della Signoria in Siena he painted the\r\nWar of Asinalunga, and after it the Peace and its events, wherein he\r\nfashioned a map, perfect for those times; and in the same palace he made\r\neight scenes in terra-verde, highly finished. It is said that he also\r\nsent to Volterra a panel in distemper which was much praised in that\r\ncity. And painting a chapel in fresco and a panel in distemper at Massa,\r\nin company with others, he gave them proof how great, both in judgment\r\nand in genius, was his worth in the art of painting; and in Orvieto he\r\npainted in fresco the principal Chapel of S. Maria. After these works,\r\nproceeding to Florence, he made a panel in S. Procolo, and in a chapel\r\nhe painted the stories of S. Nicholas with little figures, in order to\r\nsatisfy certain of his friends, who desired to see his method of\r\nworking; and, being much practised, he executed this work in so short a\r\ntime that there accrued to him fame and infinite repute. And this work,\r\non the predella of which he made his own portrait, brought it about that\r\nin the year 1335 he was summoned to Cortona by order of Bishop Ubertini,\r\nthen lord of that city, where he wrought certain works in the Church of\r\nS. Margherita, built a short time before for the Friars of S. Francis on\r\nthe summit of the hill, and in particular the half of the vaulting and\r\nthe walls, so well that, although to-day they are wellnigh eaten away by\r\ntime, there are seen notwithstanding most beautiful effects in the\r\nfigures; and it is clear that he was deservedly commended for them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMBROGIO LORENZETTI: MADONNA AND CHILD WITH S.S. MARY\r\nMAGDALENE AND DOROTHY\r\n\r\n(_Siena: Pinacoteca 77. Panel_)]\r\n\r\nThis work finished, Ambrogio returned to Siena, where he lived\r\nhonourably the remainder of his life, not only by reason of being an\r\nexcellent master in painting, but also because, having given attention\r\nin his youth to letters, they were a useful and pleasant\r\naccompaniment to him in his painting, and so great an ornament to his\r\nwhole life that they rendered him no less popular and beloved than did\r\nhis profession of painting; wherefore he was not only intimate with men\r\nof learning and of taste, but he was also employed, to his great honour\r\nand advantage, in the government of his Republic. The ways of Ambrogio\r\nwere in all respects worthy of praise, and rather those of a gentleman\r\nand a philosopher than of a craftsman; and what most demonstrates the\r\nwisdom of men, he had ever a mind disposed to be content with that which\r\nthe world and time brought, wherefore he supported with a mind temperate\r\nand calm the good and the evil that came to him from fortune. And truly\r\nit cannot be told to what extent courteous ways and modesty, with the\r\nother good habits, are an honourable accompaniment to all the arts, and\r\nin particular to those that are derived from the intellect and from\r\nnoble and exalted talents; wherefore every man should make himself no\r\nless beloved with his ways than with the excellence of his art.\r\n\r\nFinally, at the end of his life, Ambrogio made a panel at Monte Oliveto\r\ndi Chiusuri with great credit to himself, and a little afterwards, being\r\neighty-three years of age, he passed happily and in the Christian faith\r\nto a better life. His works date about 1340.\r\n\r\nAs it has been said, the portrait of Ambrogio, by his own hand, is seen\r\nin the predella of his panel in S. Procolo, with a cap on his head. And\r\nwhat was his worth in draughtsmanship is seen in our book, wherein are\r\nsome passing good drawings by his hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nMADONNA AND CHILD\r\n\r\n(_Central panel of the polyptych by_ Ambrogio Lorenzetti. _Massa\r\nMarittima: Municipio_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIETRO CAVALLINI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF PIETRO CAVALLINI,\r\n\r\nPAINTER OF ROME\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many centuries Rome had been deprived not only of fine letters and\r\nof the glory of arms but also of all the sciences and fine arts, when,\r\nby the will of God, there was born therein Pietro Cavallini, in those\r\ntimes when Giotto, having, it may be said, restored painting to life,\r\nwas holding the sovereignty among the painters in Italy. He, then,\r\nhaving been a disciple of Giotto and having worked with Giotto himself\r\non the Navicella in mosaic in S. Pietro, was the first who, after him,\r\ngave light to that art, and he began to show that he had been no\r\nunworthy disciple of so great a master when he painted, over the door of\r\nthe sacristy of the Araceli, some scenes that are to-day eaten away by\r\ntime, and very many works coloured in fresco throughout the whole Church\r\nof S. Maria di Trastevere. Afterwards, working in mosaic on the\r\nprincipal chapel and on the facade of the church, he showed in the\r\nbeginning of such a work, without the help of Giotto, that he was no\r\nless able in the execution and bringing to completion of mosaics than he\r\nwas in painting. Making many scenes in fresco, also, in the Church of S.\r\nGrisogono, he strove to make himself known both as the best disciple of\r\nGiotto and as a good craftsman. In like manner, also in Trastevere, he\r\npainted almost the whole Church of S. Cecilia with his own hand, and\r\nmany works in the Church of S. Francesco appresso Ripa. He then made the\r\nfacade of mosaic in S. Paolo without Rome, and many stories of the Old\r\nTestament for the central nave. And painting some works in fresco in the\r\nChapter-house of the first cloister, he put therein so great diligence\r\nthat he gained thereby from men of judgment the name of being a most\r\nexcellent master, and was therefore so much favoured by the prelates\r\nthat they commissioned him to do the inner wall of S. Pietro, between\r\nthe windows. Between these he made the four Evangelists, wrought very\r\nwell in fresco, of extraordinary size in comparison with the figures\r\nthat at that time were customary, with a S. Peter and a S. Paul, and a\r\ngood number of figures in a ship, wherein, the Greek manner pleasing him\r\nmuch, he blended it ever with that of Giotto; and since he delighted to\r\ngive relief to his figures, it is recognized that he used thereunto the\r\ngreatest efforts that can be imagined by man. But the best work that he\r\nmade in that city was in the said Church of Araceli on the Campidoglio,\r\nwhere he painted in fresco, on the vaulting of the principal apse, the\r\nMadonna with the Child in her arms, surrounded by a circle of sunlight,\r\nand beneath is the Emperor Octavian, to whom the Tiburtine Sibyl is\r\nshowing Jesus Christ, and he is adoring Him; and the figures in this\r\nwork, as it has been said in other places, have been much better\r\npreserved than the others, because those that are on the vaulting are\r\nless injured by dust than those that are made on the walls.\r\n\r\nAfter these works Pietro went to Tuscany, in order to see the works of\r\nthe other disciples of his master Giotto and those of Giotto himself;\r\nand with this occasion he painted many figures in S. Marco in Florence,\r\nwhich are not seen to-day, the church having been whitewashed, except\r\nthe Annunciation, which stands covered beside the principal door of the\r\nchurch. In S. Basilio, also, in the Canto alla Macine, he made another\r\nAnnunciation in fresco on a wall, so like to that which he had made\r\nbefore in S. Marco, and to another one that is in Florence, that some\r\nbelieve, and not without probability, that they are all by the hand of\r\nthis Pietro; and in truth they could not be more like, one to another,\r\nthan they are. Among the figures that he made in the said S. Marco in\r\nFlorence was the portrait of Pope Urban V from the life, with the heads\r\nof S. Peter and S. Paul; from which portrait Fra Giovanni da Fiesole\r\ncopied that one which is in a panel in S. Domenico, also of Fiesole; and\r\nthat was no small good-fortune, seeing that the portrait which was in S.\r\nMarco and many other figures that were about the church in fresco were\r\ncovered with whitewash, as it has been said, when that convent was taken\r\nfrom the monks who occupied it before and given to the Preaching\r\nFriars, the whole being whitewashed with little attention and\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nHEAD OF AN APOSTLE\r\n\r\n(_Detail from_ \"The Last Judgment,\" _after the fresco by_ Pietro\r\nCavallini. _Rome: Convent of S. Cecilia_)]\r\n\r\nPassing afterwards, in returning to Rome, through Assisi, not only in\r\norder to see those buildings and those notable works made there by his\r\nmaster and by some of his fellow-disciples, but also to leave something\r\nthere by his own hand, he painted in fresco in the lower Church of S.\r\nFrancesco--namely, in the transept that is on the side of the\r\nsacristy--a Crucifixion of Jesus Christ, with men on horseback armed in\r\nvarious fashions, and with many varied and extravagant costumes of\r\ndiverse foreign peoples. In the air he made some angels, who, poised on\r\ntheir wings in diverse attitudes, are in a storm of weeping; and some\r\npressing their hands to their breasts, others wringing them, and others\r\nbeating the palms, they are showing that they feel the greatest grief at\r\nthe death of the Son of God; and all, from the middle backwards, or\r\nrather from the middle downwards, melt away into air. In this work, well\r\nexecuted in the colouring, which is fresh and vivacious and so well\r\ncontrived in the junctions of the plaster that the work appears all made\r\nin one day, I have found the coat of arms of Gualtieri, Duke of Athens;\r\nbut by reason of there not being either a date or other writing there, I\r\ncannot affirm that it was caused to be made by him. I say, however, that\r\nbesides the firm belief of everyone that it is by the hand of Pietro,\r\nthe manner could not be more like his than it is, not to mention that it\r\nmay be believed, this painter having lived at the time when Duke\r\nGualtieri was in Italy, that it was made by Pietro as well as by order\r\nof the said Duke. At least, let everyone think as he pleases, the work,\r\nas ancient, is worthy of nothing but praise, and the manner, besides the\r\npublic voice, shows that it is by the hand of this man.\r\n\r\nIn the Church of S. Maria at Orvieto, wherein is the most holy relic of\r\nthe Corporal, the same Pietro wrought in fresco certain stories of Jesus\r\nChrist and of the Host, with much diligence; and this he did, so it is\r\nsaid, for Messer Benedetto, son of Messer Buonconte Monaldeschi and lord\r\nat that time, or rather tyrant, of that city. Some likewise affirm that\r\nPietro made some sculptures, and that they were very successful, because\r\nhe had genius for whatever he set himself to do, and that he made the\r\nCrucifix that is in the great Church of S. Paolo without Rome; which\r\nCrucifix, as it is said and may be believed, is the one that spoke to S.\r\nBrigida in the year 1370.\r\n\r\nBy the hand of the same man were some other works in that manner, which\r\nwere thrown to the ground when the old Church of S. Pietro was pulled\r\ndown in order to build the new. Pietro was very diligent in all his\r\nworks, and sought with every effort to gain honour and to acquire fame\r\nin the art. He was not only a good Christian, but most devout and very\r\nmuch the friend of the poor, and he was beloved by reason of his\r\nexcellence not only in his native city of Rome but by all those who had\r\nknowledge of him or of his works. And finally, he devoted himself at the\r\nend of his old age to religion, leading an exemplary life, with so much\r\nzeal that he was almost held a saint. Wherefore there is no reason to\r\nmarvel not only that the said Crucifix by his hand spoke to the Saint,\r\nas it has been said, but also that innumerable miracles have been and\r\nstill are wrought by a certain Madonna by his hand, which I do not\r\nintend to call his best, although it is very famous in all Italy and\r\nalthough I know very certainly and surely, by the manner of the\r\npainting, that it is by the hand of Pietro, whose most praiseworthy life\r\nand piety towards God were worthy to be imitated by all men. Nor let\r\nanyone believe, for the reason that it is scarcely possible and that\r\nexperience continually shows this to us, that it is possible to attain\r\nto honourable rank without the fear and grace of God and without\r\ngoodness of life. A disciple of Pietro Cavallini was Giovanni da\r\nPistoia, who made some works of no great importance in his native city.\r\n\r\nFinally, at the age of eighty-five, he died in Rome of a colic caught\r\nwhile working in fresco, by reason of the damp and of standing\r\ncontinually at this exercise. His pictures date about the year 1364, and\r\nhe was honourably buried in S. Paolo without Rome, with this epitaph:\r\n\r\n     QUANTUM ROMANAE PETRUS DECUS ADDIDIT URBI\r\n     PICTURA, TANTUM DAT DECUS IPSE POLO.\r\n\r\nHis portrait has never been found, for all the diligence that has been\r\nused; it is therefore not included.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nHEAD OF THE CHRIST IN GLORY\r\n\r\n(_Detail from_ \"The Last Judgment,\" _after the fresco by_ Pietro\r\nCavallini. _Rome: Convent of S.

LOUIS CROWNING KING ROBERT OF NAPLES\r\n\r\n(_After the Altarpiece by_ Simon Sanese [Memmi _or_ Martini]. _Naples:\r\nChurch of S. Lorenzo_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF SIMONE SANESE\r\n\r\n[_SIMONE MEMMI OR MARTINI_]\r\n\r\nPAINTER\r\n\r\n\r\nTruly happy can those men be called, who are inclined by nature to those\r\narts that can bring to them not only honour and very great profit, but\r\nalso, what is more, fame and a name wellnigh eternal, and happier still\r\nare they who have from their cradles, besides such inclination, courtesy\r\nand honest ways, which render them very dear to all men. But happiest of\r\nall, finally, talking of craftsmen, are they who not only receive a love\r\nof the good from nature, and noble ways from the same source and from\r\neducation, but also live in the time of some famous writer, from whom,\r\nin return for a little portrait or some other similar courtesy in the\r\nway of art, they gain on occasion the reward of eternal honour and name,\r\nby means of their writings; and this, among those who practise the arts\r\nof design, should be particularly desired and sought by the excellent\r\npainters, seeing that their works, being on the surface and on a ground\r\nof colour, cannot have that eternal life which castings in bronze and\r\nworks in marble give to sculpture, or buildings to the architects.\r\n\r\nVery great, then, was that good-fortune of Simone, to live at the time\r\nof Messer Francesco Petrarca and to chance to find that most amorous\r\npoet at the Court of Avignon, desirous of having the image of Madonna\r\nLaura by the hand of Maestro Simone, because, having received it as\r\nbeautiful as he had desired, he made memory of him in two sonnets,\r\nwhereof one begins:\r\n\r\n     Per mirar Policleto a prova fiso\r\n     Con gli altri che ebber fama di quell'arte;\r\n\r\nand the second:\r\n\r\n     Quando giunse a Simon l'alto concetto\r\n     Ch'a mio nome gli pose in man lo stile.\r\n\r\nThese sonnets, in truth, together with the mention made of him in one of\r\nhis _Familiar Letters_, in the fifth book, which begins: \"Non sum\r\nnescius,\" have given more fame to the poor life of Maestro Simone than\r\nall his own works have ever done or ever will, seeing that they must at\r\nsome time perish, whereas the writings of so great a man will live for\r\neternal ages. Simone Memmi of Siena, then, was an excellent painter,\r\nremarkable in his own times and much esteemed at the Court of the Pope,\r\nfor the reason that after the death of Giotto his master, whom he had\r\nfollowed to Rome when he made the Navicella in mosaic and the other\r\nworks, he made a Virgin Mary in the portico of S. Pietro, with a S.\r\nPeter and a S. Paul, near to the place where the bronze pine-cone is, on\r\na wall between the arches of the portico on the outer side; and in this\r\nhe counterfeited the manner of Giotto very well, receiving so much\r\npraise, above all because he portrayed therein a sacristan of S. Pietro\r\nlighting some lamps before the said figures with much promptness, that\r\nhe was summoned with very great insistence to the Court of the Pope at\r\nAvignon, where he wrought so many pictures, in fresco and on panels,\r\nthat he made his works correspond to the reputation that had been borne\r\nthither. Whence, having returned to Siena in great credit and much\r\nfavoured on this account, he was commissioned by the Signoria to paint\r\nin fresco, in a hall of their Palace, a Virgin Mary with many figures\r\nround her, which he completed with all perfection to his own great\r\ncredit and advantage. And in order to show that he was no less able to\r\nwork on panel than in fresco, he painted in the said Palace a panel\r\nwhich led to his being afterwards made to paint two of them in the\r\nDuomo, and a Madonna with the Child in her arms, in a very beautiful\r\nattitude, over the door of the Office of the Works of the said Duomo. In\r\nthis picture certain angels, supporting a standard in the air, are\r\nflying and looking down on to some saints who are round the Madonna, and\r\nthey make a very beautiful composition and great adornment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIMONE MARTINI: KNIGHTING OF S. MARTIN\r\n\r\n(_Assisi: Lower Church of S. Francesco, Chapel of S. Martin. Fresco_)]\r\n\r\nThis done, Simone was brought by the General of the Augustinians to\r\nFlorence, where he painted the Chapter-house of S. Spirito, showing\r\ninvention and admirable judgment in the figures and the horses that he\r\nmade, as is proved in that place by the story of the Passion of\r\nChrist, wherein everything is seen to have been made by him with\r\ningenuity, with discretion, and with most beautiful grace. There are\r\nseen the Thieves on the Cross yielding up their breath, and the soul of\r\nthe good one being carried to Heaven by the angels, and that of the\r\nwicked one going, accompanied by devils and all harassed, to the\r\ntorments of Hell. Simone likewise showed invention and judgment in the\r\nattitudes and in the very bitter weeping of some angels round the\r\nCrucifix. But what is most worthy of consideration, above everything\r\nelse, is to see those spirits visibly cleaving the air with their\r\nshoulders, almost whirling right round and yet sustaining the motion of\r\ntheir flight. This work would bear much stronger witness to the\r\nexcellence of Simone, if, besides the fact that time has eaten it away,\r\nit had not been spoilt by those Fathers in the year 1560, when they,\r\nbeing unable to use the Chapter-house, because it was in bad condition\r\nfrom damp, made a vaulted roof to replace a worm-eaten ceiling, and\r\nthrew down the little that was left of the pictures of this man. About\r\nthe same time Simone painted a Madonna and a S. Luke, with some other\r\nSaints, on a panel in distemper, which is to-day in the Chapel of the\r\nGondi in S. Maria Novella, with his name.\r\n\r\nNext, Simone painted three walls of the Chapter-house of the said S.\r\nMaria Novella, very happily. On the first, which is over the door\r\nwhereby one enters, he made the life of S. Dominic; and on that which\r\nfollows in the direction of the church, he represented the Religious\r\nOrder of the same Saint fighting against the heretics, represented by\r\nwolves, which are attacking some sheep, which are defended by many dogs\r\nspotted with black and white, and the wolves are beaten back and slain.\r\nThere are also certain heretics, who, being convinced in disputation,\r\nare tearing their books and penitently confessing themselves, and so\r\ntheir souls are passing through the gate of Paradise, wherein are many\r\nlittle figures that are doing diverse things. In Heaven is seen the\r\nglory of the Saints, and Jesus Christ; and in the world below remain the\r\nvain pleasures and delights, in human figures, and above all in the\r\nshape of women who are seated, among whom is the Madonna Laura of\r\nPetrarca, portrayed from life and clothed in green, with a little flame\r\nof fire between her breast and her throat. There is also the Church of\r\nChrist, and, as a guard for her, the Pope, the Emperor, the Kings, the\r\nCardinals, the Bishops, and all the Christian Princes; and among them,\r\nbeside a Knight of Rhodes, is Messer Francesco Petrarca, also portrayed\r\nfrom the life, which Simone did in order to enhance by his works the\r\nfame of the man who had made him immortal. For the Universal Church he\r\npainted the Church of S. Maria del Fiore, not as it stands to-day, but\r\nas he had drawn it from the model and design that the architect Arnolfo\r\nhad left in the Office of Works for the guidance of those who had to\r\ncontinue the building after him; of which models, by reason of the\r\nlittle care of the Wardens of Works of S. Maria del Fiore, as it has\r\nbeen said in another place, there would be no memorial for us if Simone\r\nhad not left it painted in this work. On the third wall, which is that\r\nof the altar, he made the Passion of Christ, who, issuing from Jerusalem\r\nwith the Cross on His shoulder, is going to Mount Calvary, followed by a\r\nvery great multitude. Arriving there, He is seen raised on the Cross\r\nbetween the Thieves, with the other circumstances that accompany this\r\nstory. I will say nothing of there being therein a good number of\r\nhorses, of the casting of lots by the servants of the court for the\r\ngarments of Christ, of the raising of the Holy Fathers from the Limbo of\r\nHell, and of all the other well-conceived inventions, which belong not\r\nso much to a master of that age as to the most excellent of the moderns;\r\ninasmuch as, taking up the whole walls, with very diligent judgment he\r\nmade in each wall diverse scenes on the slope of a mountain, and did not\r\ndivide scene from scene with ornamental borders, as the old painters\r\nwere wont to do, and many moderns, who put the earth over the sky four\r\nor five times, as it is seen in the principal chapel of this same\r\nchurch, and in the Campo Santo of Pisa, where, painting many works in\r\nfresco, he was forced against his will to make such divisions, for the\r\nother painters who had worked in that place, such as Giotto and\r\nBuonamico his master, had begun to make their scenes with this bad\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _G. H._\r\n\r\nTHE ANNUNCIATION\r\n\r\n(_After the painting by_ Simone Sanese [Memmi _or_ Martini]. _Antwerp:\r\nRoyal Museum, 257, 258_)]\r\n\r\nIn that Campo Santo, then, following as the lesser evil the method used\r\nby the others, Simone made in fresco, over the principal door and on the\r\ninner side, a Madonna borne to Heaven by a choir of angels, who are\r\nsinging and playing so vividly that there are seen in them all those\r\nvarious gestures that musicians are wont to make in singing or playing,\r\nsuch as turning the ears to the sound, opening the mouth in diverse\r\nways, raising the eyes to Heaven, blowing out the cheeks, swelling the\r\nthroat, and in short all the other actions and movements that are made\r\nin music. Under this Assumption, in three pictures, he made some scenes\r\nfrom the life of S. Ranieri of Pisa. In the first scene he is shown as a\r\nyouth, playing the psaltery and making some girls dance, who are most\r\nbeautiful by reason of the air of the heads and of the loveliness of the\r\ncostumes and head-dresses of those times. Next, the same Ranieri, having\r\nbeen reproved for such lasciviousness by the Blessed Alberto the Hermit,\r\nis seen standing with his face downcast and tearful and with his eyes\r\nred from weeping, all penitent for his sin, while God, in the sky,\r\nsurrounded by a celestial light, appears to be pardoning him. In the\r\nsecond picture Ranieri, distributing his wealth to God's poor before\r\nmounting on board ship, has round him a crowd of beggars, of cripples,\r\nof women, and of children, all most touching in their pushing forward,\r\ntheir entreating, and their thanking him. And in the same picture, also,\r\nthat Saint, having received in the Temple the gown of a pilgrim, is\r\nstanding before a Madonna, who, surrounded by many angels, is showing\r\nhim that he will repose on her bosom in Pisa; and all these figures have\r\nvivacity and a beautiful air in the heads. In the third Simone painted\r\nthe scene when, having returned after seven years from beyond the seas,\r\nhe is showing that he has spent thrice forty days in the Holy Land, and\r\nwhen, standing in the choir to hear the Divine offices, he is tempted by\r\nthe Devil, who is seen driven away by a firm determination that is\r\nperceived in Ranieri not to consent to offend God, assisted by a figure\r\nmade by Simone to represent Constancy, who is chasing away the ancient\r\nadversary not only all in confusion but also (with beautiful and\r\nfanciful invention) all in terror, holding his hands to his head in his\r\nflight, and walking with his face downcast and his shoulders shrunk as\r\nclose together as could be, and saying, as it is seen from the writing\r\nthat is issuing from his mouth: \"I can no more.\" And finally, there is\r\nalso in this picture the scene when Ranieri, kneeling on Mount Tabor,\r\nis miraculously seeing Christ in air with Moses and Elias; and all the\r\nfeatures of this work, with others that are not mentioned, show that\r\nSimone was very fanciful and understood the good method of grouping\r\nfigures gracefully in the manner of those times. These scenes finished,\r\nhe made two panels in distemper in the same city, assisted by Lippo\r\nMemmi, his brother, who had also assisted him to paint the Chapter-house\r\nof S. Maria Novella and other works.\r\n\r\nHe, although he had not the excellence of Simone, none the less followed\r\nhis manner as well as he could, and made many works in fresco in his\r\ncompany for S. Croce in Florence; the panel of the high-altar in S.\r\nCaterina at Pisa, for the Preaching Friars; and in S. Paolo a Ripa d'\r\nArno, besides many very beautiful scenes in fresco, the panel in\r\ndistemper that is to-day over the high-altar, containing a Madonna, S.\r\nPeter, S. Paul, S. John the Baptist, and other Saints; and on this Lippo\r\nput his name. After these works he wrought by himself a panel in\r\ndistemper for the Friars of S. Augustine in San Gimignano, and thereby\r\nacquired so great a name that he was forced to send to Arezzo, to Bishop\r\nGuido de' Tarlati, a panel with three half-length figures which is\r\nto-day in the Chapel of S. Gregorio in the Vescovado.\r\n\r\nWhile Simone was at work in Florence, one his cousin, an ingenious\r\narchitect called Neroccio, undertook in the year 1332 to make to ring\r\nthe great bell of the Commune of Florence, which, for a period of\r\nseventeen years, no one had been able to make to ring without twelve men\r\nto pull at it. He balanced it, then, in a manner that two could move it,\r\nand once moved one alone could ring it without a break, although it\r\nweighed more than six thousand libbre; wherefore, besides the honour, he\r\ngained thereby as his reward three hundred florins of gold, which was\r\ngreat payment in those times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIPPO MEMMI: MADONNA AND CHILD\r\n\r\n(_Berlin: K. Friedrich Museum 1081A. Panel_)]\r\n\r\nBut to return to our two Memmi of Siena; Lippo, besides the works\r\nmentioned, wrought a panel in distemper, with the design of Simone,\r\nwhich was carried to Pistoia and placed over the high-altar of the\r\nChurch of S. Francesco, and was held very beautiful. Finally, both\r\nhaving returned to their native city of Siena, Simone began a very large\r\nwork in colour over the great gate of Camollia, containing the\r\nCoronation of Our Lady, with an infinity of figures, which remained\r\nunfinished, a very great sickness coming upon him, so that he, overcome\r\nby the gravity of the sickness, passed away from this life in the year\r\n1345, to the very great sorrow of all his city and of Lippo his brother,\r\nwho gave him honourable burial in S. Francesco.\r\n\r\nLippo afterwards finished many works that Simone had left imperfect, and\r\namong these was a Passion of Jesus Christ over the high-altar of S.\r\nNiccola in Ancona, wherein Lippo finished what Simone had begun,\r\nimitating that which the said Simone had made and finished in the\r\nChapter-house of S. Spirito in Florence. This work would be worthy of a\r\nlonger life than peradventure will be granted to it, there being in it\r\nmany horses and soldiers in beautiful attitudes, which they are striking\r\nwith various animated movements, doubting and marvelling whether they\r\nhave crucified or not the Son of God. At Assisi, likewise, in the lower\r\nChurch of S. Francesco, he finished some figures that Simone had begun\r\nfor the altar of S. Elizabeth, which is at the entrance of the door that\r\nleads into the chapels, making there a Madonna, a S. Louis King of\r\nFrance, and other Saints, in all eight figures, which are only as far as\r\nthe knees, but good and very well coloured. Besides this, in the great\r\nrefectory of the said convent, at the top of the wall, Simone had begun\r\nmany little scenes and a Crucifix made in the shape of a Tree of the\r\nCross, but this remained unfinished and outlined with the brush in red\r\nover the plaster, as may still be seen to-day; which method of working\r\nwas the cartoon that our old masters used to make for painting in\r\nfresco, for greater rapidity; for having distributed the whole work over\r\nthe plaster, they would outline it with the brush, reproducing from a\r\nsmall design all that which they wished to paint, and enlarging in\r\nproportion all that they thought to put down. Wherefore, even as this\r\none is seen thus outlined, and many others in other places, so there are\r\nmany others that had once been painted, from which the work afterwards\r\npeeled off, leaving them thus outlined in red over the plaster.\r\n\r\nBut returning to our Lippo, who drew passing well, as it may be seen in\r\nour book in a hermit who is reading with his legs crossed; he lived for\r\ntwelve years after Simone, executing many works throughout all Italy,\r\nand in particular two panels in S. Croce in Florence. And seeing that\r\nthe manner of these two brothers is very similar, one can distinguish\r\nthe one from the other by this, that Simone used to sign his name at the\r\nfoot of his works in this way: SIMONIS MEMMI SENENSIS OPUS; and Lippo,\r\nleaving out his baptismal name and caring nothing about a Latinity so\r\nrough, in this other fashion: OPUS MEMMI DE SENIS ME FECIT.\r\n\r\nOn the wall of the Chapter-house of S. Maria Novella--besides Petrarca\r\nand Madonna Laura, as it has been said above--Simone portrayed Cimabue,\r\nthe architect Lapo, his son Arnolfo, and himself, and in the person of\r\nthat Pope who is in the scene he painted Benedetto XI of Treviso, one of\r\nthe Preaching Friars, the likeness of which Pope had been brought to\r\nSimone long before by Giotto, his master, when he returned from the\r\nCourt of the said Pope, who had his seat in Avignon. In the same place,\r\nalso, beside the said Pope, he portrayed Cardinal Niccola da Prato, who\r\nhad come to Florence at that time as Legate of the said Pontiff, as\r\nGiovanni Villani relates in his History.\r\n\r\nOver the tomb of Simone was placed this epitaph:\r\n\r\n     SIMONI MEMMIO PICTORUM OMNIUM OMNIS AETATIS CELEBERRIMO.\r\n     VIXIT ANN. LX, MENS. II, D. III.\r\n\r\nAs it is seen in our aforesaid book, Simone was not very excellent in\r\ndraughtsmanship, but he had invention from nature, and he took much\r\ndelight in drawing portraits from the life; and in this he was held so\r\nmuch the greatest master of his times that Signor Pandolfo Malatesti\r\nsent him as far as Avignon to portray Messer Francesco Petrarca, at the\r\nrequest of whom he made afterwards the portrait of Madonna Laura, with\r\nso much credit to himself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _M. S._\r\n\r\nMADONNA AND CHILD\r\n\r\n(_After the painting by_ Lippo Memmi. _Altenburg: Lindenau Museum, 43_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTADDEO GADDI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF TADDEO GADDI,\r\n\r\nPAINTER OF FLORENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful and truly useful and praiseworthy action to reward\r\ntalent largely in every place, and to honour him who has it, seeing that\r\nan infinity of intellects which might otherwise slumber, roused by this\r\nencouragement, strive with all industry not only to learn their art but\r\nto become excellent therein, in order to advance themselves and to\r\nattain to a rank both profitable and honourable; whence there may follow\r\nhonour for their country, glory for themselves, and riches and nobility\r\nfor their descendants, who, upraised by such beginnings, very often\r\nbecome both very rich and very noble, even as the descendants of the\r\npainter Taddeo Gaddi did by reason of his work. This Taddeo di Gaddo\r\nGaddi, a Florentine, after the death of Giotto--who had held him at his\r\nbaptism and had been his master for twenty-four years after the death of\r\nGaddo, as it is written by Cennino di Drea Cennini, painter of Colle di\r\nValdelsa--remained among the first in the art of painting and greater\r\nthan all his fellow-disciples both in judgment and in genius; and he\r\nwrought his first works, with a great facility given to him by nature\r\nrather than acquired by art, in the Church of S. Croce in Florence, in\r\nthe chapel of the sacristy, where, together with his companions,\r\ndisciples of the dead Giotto, he made some stories of S. Mary Magdalene,\r\nwith beautiful figures and with most beautiful and extravagant costumes\r\nof those times. And in the Chapel of the Baroncelli and Bandini, where\r\nGiotto had formerly wrought the panel in distemper, he made by himself\r\nin fresco, on one wall, some stories of Our Lady which were held very\r\nbeautiful. He also painted over the door of the said sacristy the story\r\nof Christ disputing with the Doctors in the Temple, which was afterwards\r\nhalf ruined when the elder Cosimo de' Medici, in making the noviciate,\r\nthe chapel, and the antechamber in front of the sacristy, placed a\r\ncornice of stone over the said door. In the same church he painted in\r\nfresco the Chapel of the Bellacci, and also that of S. Andrea by the\r\nside of one of the three of Giotto, wherein he made the scene of Jesus\r\nChrist taking Andrew and Peter from their nets, and the crucifixion of\r\nthe former Apostle, a work greatly commended and extolled both then when\r\nit was finished and still at the present day. Over the side-door, below\r\nthe burial-place of Carlo Marsuppini of Arezzo, he made a Dead Christ\r\nwith the Maries, wrought in fresco, which was very much praised; and\r\nbelow the tramezzo[16] that divides the church, on the left hand, above\r\nthe Crucifix of Donato, he painted in fresco a story of S. Francis,\r\nrepresenting a miracle that he wrought in restoring to life a boy who\r\nwas killed by falling from a terrace, together with his apparition in\r\nthe air. And in this story he portrayed Giotto his master, Dante the\r\npoet, Guido Cavalcanti, and, some say, himself. Throughout the said\r\nchurch, also, in diverse places, he made many figures which are known by\r\npainters from the manner. For the Company of the Temple he painted the\r\nshrine that is at the corner of the Via del Crocifisso, containing a\r\nvery beautiful Deposition from the Cross.\r\n\r\nIn the cloister of S. Spirito he wrought two scenes in the little arches\r\nbeside the Chapter-house, in one of which he made Judas selling Christ,\r\nand in the other the Last Supper that He held with the Apostles. And in\r\nthe same convent, over the door of the refectory, he painted a Crucifix\r\nand some Saints, which give us to know that among the others who worked\r\nhere he was truly an imitator of the manner of Giotto, which he held\r\never in the greatest veneration. In S. Stefano del Ponte Vecchio he\r\npainted the panel and the predella of the high-altar with great\r\ndiligence; and on a panel in the Oratory of S. Michele in Orto he made a\r\nvery good picture of a Dead Christ being lamented by the Maries and laid\r\nto rest very devoutly by Nicodemus in the Sepulchre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nTHE LAST SUPPER\r\n\r\n(_After the fresco by_ Taddeo Gaddi, _in the Refectory of S. Croce,\r\nFlorence_)]\r\n\r\nIn the Church of the Servite Friars he painted the Chapel of S. Niccolo,\r\nbelonging to those of the palace, with stories of that Saint, wherein he\r\nshowed very good judgment and grace in a boat that he painted,\r\ndemonstrating that he had complete understanding of the tempestuous\r\nagitation of the sea and of the fury of the storm; and while the\r\nmariners are emptying the ship and jettisoning the cargo, S. Nicholas\r\nappears in the air and delivers them from that peril. This work, having\r\ngiven pleasure and having been much praised, was the reason that he was\r\nmade to paint the chapel of the high-altar in that church, wherein he\r\nmade in fresco some stories of Our Lady, and another figure of Our Lady\r\non a panel in distemper, with many Saints wrought in lively fashion. In\r\nlike manner, in the predella of the said panel, he made some other\r\nstories of Our Lady with little figures, whereof there is no need to\r\nmake particular mention, seeing that in the year 1467 everything was\r\ndestroyed when Lodovico, Marquis of Mantua, made in that place the\r\ntribune that is there to-day and the choir of the friars, with the\r\ndesign of Leon Battista Alberti, causing the panel to be carried into\r\nthe Chapter-house of that convent; in the refectory of which Taddeo\r\nmade, just above the wooden seats, the Last Supper of Jesus Christ with\r\nthe Apostles, and above that a Crucifix with many saints.\r\n\r\nHaving given the last touch to these works, Taddeo Gaddi was summoned to\r\nPisa, where, for Gherardo and Bonaccorso Gambacorti, he wrought in\r\nfresco the principal chapel of S. Francesco, painting with beautiful\r\ncolours many figures and stories of that Saint and of S. Andrew and S.\r\nNicholas. Next, on the vaulting and on the front wall is Pope Honorius,\r\nwho is confirming the Order; here Taddeo is portrayed from the life, in\r\nprofile, with a cap wrapped round his head, and at the foot of this\r\nscene are written these words:\r\n\r\n     MAGISTER TADDEUS GADDUS DE FLORENTIA PINXIT HANC HISTORIAM SANCTI\r\n     FRANCISCI ET SANCTI ANDREAE ET SANCTI NICOLAI, ANNO DOMINI MCCCXLII,\r\n     DE MENSE AUGUSTI.\r\n\r\nBesides this, in the cloister also of the same convent he made in fresco\r\na Madonna with her Child in her arms, very well coloured, and in the\r\nmiddle of the church, on the left hand as one enters, a S. Louis the\r\nBishop, seated, to whom S. Gherardo da Villamagna, who had been a friar\r\nof this Order, is recommending a Fra Bartolommeo, then Prior of the\r\nsaid convent. In the figures of this work, seeing that they were taken\r\nfrom nature, there are seen liveliness and infinite grace, in that\r\nsimple manner which was in some respects better than that of Giotto,\r\nabove all in expressing supplication, joy, sorrow, and other similar\r\nemotions, which, when well expressed, ever bring very great honour to\r\nthe painter.\r\n\r\nNext, having returned to Florence, Taddeo continued for the Commune the\r\nwork of Orsanmichele and refounded the piers of the Loggia, building\r\nthem with stone dressed and well shaped, whereas before they had been\r\nmade of bricks, without, however, altering the design that Arnolfo left,\r\nwith directions that there should be made over the Loggia a palace with\r\ntwo vaults for storing the provisions of grain that the people and\r\nCommune of Florence used to make. To the end that this work might be\r\nfinished, the Guild of Porta S. Maria, to which the charge of the fabric\r\nhad been given, ordained that there should be paid thereunto the tax of\r\nthe square of the grain-market and some other taxes of very small\r\nimportance. But what was far more important, it was well ordained with\r\nthe best counsel that each of the Guilds of Florence should make one\r\npier by itself, with the Patron Saint of the Guild in a niche therein,\r\nand that every year, on the festival of each Saint the Consuls of that\r\nGuild should go to church to make offering, and should hold there the\r\nwhole of that day the standard with their insignia, but that the\r\noffering, none the less, should be to the Madonna for the succour of the\r\nneedy poor. And because, during the great flood of the year 1333, the\r\nwaters had swept away the parapets of the Ponte Rubaconte, thrown down\r\nthe Castle of Altafronte, left nothing of the Ponte Vecchio but the two\r\npiers in the middle, and completely ruined the Ponte a S. Trinita except\r\none pier that remained all shattered, as well as half the Ponte alla\r\nCarraia, bursting also the weir of Ognissanti, those who then ruled the\r\ncity determined no longer to allow the dwellers on the other side of the\r\nArno to have to return to their homes with so great inconvenience as was\r\ncaused by their having to cross in boats. Wherefore, having sent for\r\nTaddeo Gaddi, for the reason that Giotto his master had gone to Milan,\r\nthey caused him to make the model and design of the Ponte Vecchio,\r\ngiving him instructions that he should have it brought to completion as\r\nstrong and as beautiful as might be possible; and he, sparing neither\r\ncost nor labour, made it with such strength in the piers and with such\r\nmagnificence in the arches, all of stone squared with the chisel, that\r\nit supports to-day twenty-two shops on either side, which make in all\r\nforty-four, with great profit to the Commune, which drew from them eight\r\nhundred florins yearly in rents. The extent of the arches from one side\r\nto the other is thirty-two braccia, that of the street in the middle is\r\nsixteen braccia, and that of the shops on either side eight braccia. For\r\nthis work, which cost sixty thousand florins of gold, not only did\r\nTaddeo then deserve infinite praise, but even to-day he is more than\r\never commended for it, for the reason that, besides many other floods,\r\nit was not moved in the year 1557, on September 13, by that which threw\r\ndown the Ponte a S. Trinita and two arches of that of the Carraia, and\r\nshattered in great part the Rubaconte, together with much other\r\ndestruction that is very well known. And truly there is no man of\r\njudgment who can fail to be amazed, not to say marvel, considering that\r\nthe said Ponte Vecchio in so great an emergency could sustain unmoved\r\nthe onset of the waters and of the beams and the wreckage made above,\r\nand that with so great firmness.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Taddeo directed the founding of the Ponte a S. Trinita,\r\nwhich was finished less happily in the year 1346, at the cost of twenty\r\nthousand florins of gold; I say less happily, because, not having been\r\nmade like the Ponte Vecchio, it was entirely ruined by the said flood of\r\nthe year 1557. In like manner, under the direction of Taddeo there was\r\nmade at the said time the wall of the Costa a S. Gregorio, with piles\r\ndriven in below, including two piers of the bridge in order to gain\r\nadditional ground for the city on the side of the Piazza de' Mozzi, and\r\nto make use of it, as they did, to make the mills that are there.\r\n\r\nWhile all these works were being made by the direction and design of\r\nTaddeo, seeing that he did not therefore stop painting, he decorated the\r\nTribunal of the Mercanzia Vecchia, wherein, with poetical invention, he\r\nrepresented the Tribunal of Six (which is the number of the chief men of\r\nthat judicial body), who are standing watching the tongue being torn\r\nfrom Falsehood by Truth, who is clothed with a veil over the nude, while\r\nFalsehood is draped in black; with these verses below:\r\n\r\n     LA PURA VERITA, PER UBBIDIRE\r\n     ALLA SANTA GIUSTIZIA, CHE NON TARDA,\r\n     CAVA LA LINGUA ALLA FALSA BUGIARDA.\r\n\r\nAnd below the scene are these verses:\r\n\r\n     TADDEO DIPINSE QUESTO BEL RIGESTRO;\r\n     DISCEPOL FU DI GIOTTO IL BUON MAESTRO.\r\n\r\nTaddeo received a commission for some works in fresco in Arezzo, which\r\nhe carried to the greatest perfection in company with his disciple\r\nGiovanni da Milano. Of these we still see one in the Company of the Holy\r\nSpirit, a scene on the wall over the high-altar, containing the Passion\r\nof Christ, with many horses, and the Thieves on the Cross, a work held\r\nvery beautiful by reason of the thought that he showed in placing Him on\r\nthe Cross. Therein are some figures with vivid expressions which show\r\nthe rage of the Jews, some pulling Him by the legs with a rope, others\r\noffering the sponge, and others in various attitudes, such as the\r\nLonginus who is piercing His side, and the three soldiers who are\r\ngambling for His raiment, in the faces of whom there is seen hope and\r\nfear as they throw the dice. The first of these, in armour, is standing\r\nin an uncomfortable attitude awaiting his turn, and shows himself so\r\neager to throw that he appears not to be feeling the discomfort; the\r\nother, raising his eyebrows, with his mouth and with his eyes wide open,\r\nis watching the dice, in suspicion, as it were, of fraud, and shows\r\nclearly to anyone who studies him the desire and the wish that he has to\r\nwin. The third, who is throwing the dice, having spread the garment on\r\nthe ground, appears to be announcing with a grin his intention of\r\ncasting them. In like manner, throughout the walls of the church are\r\nseen some stories of S. John the Evangelist, and throughout the city\r\nother works made by Taddeo, which are recognized as being by his hand by\r\nanyone who has judgment in art. In the Vescovado, also, behind the\r\nhigh-altar, there are still seen some stories of S. John the Baptist,\r\nwhich are wrought with such marvellous manner and design that they cause\r\nhim to be held in admiration. In the Chapel of S. Sebastiano in S.\r\nAgostino, beside the sacristy, he made the stories of that martyr, and a\r\nDisputation of Christ with the Doctors, so well wrought and finished\r\nthat it is a miracle to see the beauty in the changing colours of\r\nvarious sorts and the grace in the pigments of these works, which are\r\nfinished to perfection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TADDEO GADDI: THE PRESENTATION IN THE TEMPLE\r\n\r\n(_Florence: Accademia 107. Panel_)]\r\n\r\nIn the Church of the Sasso della Vernia in the Casentino he painted the\r\nchapel wherein S. Francis received the Stigmata, assisted in the minor\r\ndetails by Jacopo di Casentino, who became his disciple by reason of\r\nthis visit. This work finished, he returned to Florence together with\r\nGiovanni, the Milanese, and there, both within the city and without,\r\nthey made very many panels and pictures of importance; and in process of\r\ntime he gained so much, turning all into capital, that he laid the\r\nfoundation of the wealth and the nobility of his family, being ever held\r\na prudent and far-sighted man.\r\n\r\nHe also painted the Chapter-house in S. Maria Novella, being\r\ncommissioned by the Prior of the place, who suggested the subject to\r\nhim. It is true, indeed, that by reason of the work being large and of\r\nthere being unveiled, at that time when the bridges were being made, the\r\nChapter-house of S. Spirito, to the very great fame of Simone Memmi, who\r\nhad painted it, there came to the said Prior a desire to call Simone to\r\nthe half of this work; wherefore, having discussed the whole matter with\r\nTaddeo, he found him well contented therewith, for the reason that he\r\nhad a surpassing love for Simone, because he had been his\r\nfellow-disciple under Giotto and ever his loving friend and companion.\r\nOh! minds truly noble! seeing that without emulation, ambition, or envy,\r\nye loved one another like brothers, each rejoicing as much in the honour\r\nand profit of his friend as in his own! The work was divided, therefore,\r\nand three walls were given to Simone, as I said in his Life, and Taddeo\r\nhad the left-hand wall and the whole vaulting, which was divided by him\r\ninto four sections or quarters in accordance with the form of the\r\nvaulting itself. In the first he made the Resurrection of Christ,\r\nwherein it appears that he wished to attempt to make the splendour of\r\nthe Glorified Body give forth light, as we perceive in a city and in\r\nsome mountainous crags; but he did not follow this up in the figures and\r\nin the rest, doubting, perchance, that he was not able to carry it out\r\nby reason of the difficulty that he recognized therein. In the second\r\nsection he made Jesus Christ delivering S. Peter from shipwreck, wherein\r\nthe Apostles who are manning the boat are certainly very beautiful; and\r\namong other things, one who is fishing with a line on the shore of the\r\nsea (a subject already used by Giotto in the mosaics of the Navicella in\r\nS. Pietro) is depicted with very great and vivid feeling. In the third\r\nhe painted the Ascension of Christ, and in the fourth the coming of the\r\nHoly Spirit, where there are seen many beautiful attitudes in the\r\nfigures of the Jews who are seeking to gain entrance through the door.\r\nOn the wall below are the Seven Sciences, with their names and with\r\nthose figures below them that are appropriate to each. Grammar, in the\r\nguise of a woman, with a door, teaching a child, has the writer Donato\r\nseated below her. After Grammar follows Rhetoric, and at her feet is a\r\nfigure that has two hands on books, while it draws a third hand from\r\nbelow its mantle and holds it to its mouth. Logic has the serpent in her\r\nhand below a veil, and at her feet Zeno of Elea, who is reading.\r\nArithmetic is holding the tables of the abacus, and below her is sitting\r\nAbraham, its inventor. Music has the musical instruments, and below her\r\nis sitting Tubal-Cain, who is beating with two hammers on an anvil and\r\nis standing with his ears intent on that sound. Geometry has the square\r\nand the compasses, and below, Euclid. Astrology has the celestial globe\r\nin her hands, and below her feet, Atlas. In the other part are sitting\r\nseven Theological Sciences, and each has below her that estate or\r\ncondition of man that is most appropriate to her--Pope, Emperor, King,\r\nCardinals, Dukes, Bishops, Marquises, and others; and in the face of the\r\nPope is the portrait of Clement V. In the middle and highest place is S.\r\nThomas Aquinas, who was adorned with all the said sciences, holding\r\nbelow his feet some heretics--Arius, Sabellius, and Averroes; and round\r\nhim are Moses, Paul, John the Evangelist, and some other figures, that\r\nhave above them the four Cardinal Virtues and the three Theological,\r\nwith an infinity of other details depicted by Taddeo with no little\r\ndesign and grace, insomuch that it can be said to have been the best\r\nconceived as well as the best preserved of all his works.\r\n\r\nIn the same S. Maria Novella, over the tramezzo[17] of the church, he\r\nalso made a S. Jerome robed as a Cardinal, having such a devotion for\r\nthat Saint that he chose him as the protector of his house; and below\r\nthis, after the death of Taddeo, his son caused a tomb to be made for\r\ntheir descendants, covered with a slab of marble bearing the arms of the\r\nGaddi. For these descendants, by reason of the excellence of Taddeo and\r\nof their merits, Cardinal Jerome has obtained from God most honourable\r\noffices in the Church--Clerkships of the Chamber, Bishoprics,\r\nCardinalates, Provostships, and Knighthoods, all most honourable; and\r\nall these descendants of Taddeo, of whatsoever degree, have ever\r\nesteemed and favoured the beautiful intellects inclined to the matters\r\nof sculpture and painting, and have given them assistance with every\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nFinally, having come to the age of fifty and being smitten with a most\r\nviolent fever, Taddeo passed from this life in the year 1350, leaving\r\nhis son Agnolo and Giovanni to apply themselves to painting,\r\nrecommending them to Jacopo di Casentino for ways of life and to\r\nGiovanni da Milano for instruction in the art. After the death of Taddeo\r\nthis Giovanni, besides many other works, made a panel which was placed\r\non the altar of S. Gherardo da Villamagna in S. Croce, fourteen years\r\nafter he had been left without his master, and likewise the panel of the\r\nhigh-altar of Ognissanti, where the Frati Umiliati had their seat, which\r\nwas held very beautiful, and the tribune of the high-altar at Assisi,\r\nwherein he made a Crucifix, with Our Lady and S. Chiara, and stories of\r\nOur Lady on the walls and sides. Afterwards he betook himself to Milan,\r\nwhere he wrought many works in distemper and in fresco, and there\r\nfinally he died.\r\n\r\nTaddeo, then, adhered constantly to the manner of Giotto, but did not\r\nbetter it much save in the colouring, which he made fresher and more\r\nvivacious than that of Giotto, the latter having applied himself so\r\nardently to improving the other departments and difficulties of this\r\nart, that although he gave attention to this, he could not, however,\r\nattain to the privilege of doing it, whereas Taddeo, having seen that\r\nwhich Giotto had made easy and having learnt it, had time to add\r\nsomething and to improve the colouring.\r\n\r\nTaddeo was buried by Agnolo and Giovanni, his sons, in the first\r\ncloister of S. Croce, in that tomb which he had made for Gaddo his\r\nfather, and he was much honoured with verses by the men of culture of\r\nthat time, as a man who had been greatly deserving for his ways of life\r\nand for having brought to completion with beautiful design, besides his\r\npictures, many buildings of great convenience to his city, and besides\r\nwhat has been mentioned, for having carried out with solicitude and\r\ndiligence the construction of the Campanile of S. Maria del Fiore, from\r\nthe design left by Giotto his master; which campanile was built in such\r\na manner that stones could not be put together with more diligence, nor\r\ncould a more beautiful tower be made, with regard either to ornament, or\r\ncost, or design. The epitaph that was made for Taddeo was this that is\r\nto be read here:\r\n\r\n     HOC UNO DICI POTERAT FLORENTIA FELIX\r\n     VIVENTE; AT CERTA EST NON POTUISSE MORI.\r\n\r\nTaddeo was very resolute in draughtsmanship, as it may be seen in our\r\nbook, wherein is drawn by his hand the scene that he wrought in the\r\nChapel of S. Andrea, in S. Croce at Florence.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: See note on p. 57.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: See note on p. 57.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANDREA DI CIONE ORCAGNA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF ANDREA DI CIONE ORCAGNA,\r\n\r\nPAINTER, SCULPTOR, AND ARCHITECT, OF FLORENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nRarely is a man of parts excellent in one pursuit without being able\r\neasily to learn any other, and above all any one of those that are akin\r\nto his original profession, and proceed, as it were, from one and the\r\nsame source, as did the Florentine Orcagna, who was painter, sculptor,\r\narchitect, and poet, as it will be told below. Born in Florence, he\r\nbegan while still a child to give attention to sculpture under Andrea\r\nPisano, and pursued it for some years; then, being desirous to become\r\nabundant in invention in order to make lovely historical compositions,\r\nhe applied himself with so great study to drawing, assisted by nature,\r\nwho wished to make him universal, that having tried his hand at painting\r\nwith colours both in distemper and in fresco, even as one thing leads to\r\nanother, he succeeded so well with the assistance of Bernardo Orcagna,\r\nhis brother, that this Bernardo took him in company with himself to\r\npaint the life of Our Lady in the principal chapel of S. Maria Novella,\r\nwhich then belonged to the family of the Ricci. This work, when\r\nfinished, was held very beautiful, although, by reason of the neglect of\r\nthose who afterwards had charge of it, not many years passed before, the\r\nroof becoming ruined, it was spoilt by the rains and thereby brought to\r\nthe condition wherein it is to-day, as it will be told in the proper\r\nplace. It is enough for the present to say that Domenico Ghirlandajo,\r\nwho repainted it, availed himself greatly of the invention put into it\r\nby Orcagna, who also painted in fresco in the same church the Chapel of\r\nthe Strozzi, which is near to the door of the sacristy and of the\r\nbelfry, in company with Bernardo, his brother. In this chapel, to which\r\none ascends by a staircase of stone, he painted on one wall the glory of\r\nParadise, with all the Saints and with various costumes and head-dresses\r\nof those times. On the other wall he made Hell, with the abysses,\r\ncentres, and other things described by Dante, of whom Andrea was an\r\nardent student. In the Church of the Servites in the same city he\r\npainted in fresco, also with Bernardo, the Chapel of the family of\r\nCresci; with a Coronation of Our Lady on a very large panel in S. Pietro\r\nMaggiore, and a panel in S. Romeo, close to the side-door. In like\r\nmanner, he and his brother Bernardo painted the outer facade of S.\r\nApollinare, with so great diligence that the colours in that exposed\r\nplace have been preserved marvellously vivid and beautiful up to our own\r\nday.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nCHRIST WITH THE VIRGIN ENTHRONED\r\n\r\n(_Detail from the_ \"Paradise,\" _after the fresco by_ Bernardo di Cione\r\nOrcagna. _Florence: S. Maria Novella_)]\r\n\r\nMoved by the fame of these works of Orcagna, which were much praised,\r\nthe men who at that time were governing Pisa had him summoned to work on\r\na portion of one wall in the Campo Santo of that city, even as Giotto\r\nand Buffalmacco had done before. Wherefore, putting his hand to this,\r\nAndrea painted a Universal Judgment, with some fanciful inventions of\r\nhis own, on the wall facing towards the Duomo, beside the Passion of\r\nChrist made by Buffalmacco; and making the first scene on the corner, he\r\nrepresented therein all the degrees of lords temporal wrapped in the\r\npleasures of this world, placing them seated in a flowery meadow and\r\nunder the shade of many orange-trees, which make a most delicious grove\r\nand have some Cupids in their branches above; and these Cupids, flying\r\nround and over many young women (all portraits from the life, as it\r\nseems clear, of noble ladies and dames of those times, who, by reason of\r\nthe long lapse of time, are not recognized), are making a show of\r\nshooting at the hearts of these young women, who have beside them young\r\nmen and nobles who are standing listening to music and song and watching\r\nthe amorous dances of youths and maidens, who are sweetly taking joy in\r\ntheir loves. Among these nobles Orcagna portrayed Castruccio, Lord of\r\nLucca, as a youth of most beautiful aspect, with a blue cap wound round\r\nhis head and with a hawk on his wrist, and near him other nobles of that\r\nage, of whom we know not who they are. In short, in that first part, in\r\nso far as the space permitted and his art demanded, he painted all the\r\ndelights of the world with exceeding great grace. In the other part of\r\nthe same scene he represented on a high mountain the life of those who,\r\ndrawn by repentance for their sins and by the desire to be saved,\r\nhave fled from the world to that mountain, which is all full of saintly\r\nhermits who are serving the Lord, busy in diverse pursuits with most\r\nvivacious expressions. Some, reading and praying, are shown all intent\r\non contemplation, and others, labouring in order to gain their\r\nlivelihood, are exercising themselves in various forms of action. There\r\nis seen here among others a hermit who is milking a goat, who could not\r\nbe more active or more lifelike in appearance than he is. Below there is\r\nS. Macarius showing to three Kings, who are riding with their ladies and\r\ntheir retinue and going to the chase, human misery in the form of three\r\nKings who are lying dead but not wholly corrupted in a tomb, which is\r\nbeing contemplated with attention by the living Kings in diverse and\r\nbeautiful attitudes full of wonder, and it appears as if they are\r\nreflecting with pity for their own selves that they have in a short time\r\nto become such. In one of these Kings on horseback Andrea portrayed\r\nUguccione della Faggiuola of Arezzo, in a figure which is holding its\r\nnose with one hand in order not to feel the stench of the dead and\r\ncorrupted Kings. In the middle of this scene is Death, who, flying\r\nthrough the air and draped in black, is showing that she has cut off\r\nwith her scythe the lives of many, who are lying on the ground, of all\r\nsorts and conditions, poor and rich, halt and whole, young and old, male\r\nand female, and in short a good number of every age and sex. And because\r\nhe knew that the people of Pisa took pleasure in the invention of\r\nBuffalmacco, who gave speech to the figures of Bruno in S. Paolo a Ripa\r\nd'Arno, making some letters issue from their mouths, Orcagna filled this\r\nwhole work of his with such writings, whereof the greater part, being\r\neaten away by time, cannot be understood. To certain old men, then, he\r\ngives these words:\r\n\r\n     DACCHE PROSPERITADE CI HA LASCIATI,\r\n     O MORTE, MEDICINA D' OGNI PENA,\r\n     DEH VIENI A DARNE OMAI L' ULTIMA CENA!\r\n\r\nwith other words that cannot be understood, and verses likewise in\r\nancient manner, composed, as I have discovered, by Orcagna himself, who\r\ngave attention to poetry and to making a sonnet or two. Round these dead\r\nbodies are some devils who are tearing their souls from their mouths,\r\nand are carrying them to certain pits full of fire, which are on the\r\nsummit of a very high mountain. Over against these are angels who are\r\nlikewise taking the souls from the mouths of others of these dead\r\npeople, who have belonged to the good, and are flying with them to\r\nParadise. And in this scene there is a scroll, held by two angels,\r\nwherein are these words:\r\n\r\n     ISCHERMO DI SAVERE E DI RICCHEZZA,\r\n     DI NOBILTADE ANCORA E DI PRODEZZA,\r\n     VALE NIENTE A I COLPI DI COSTEI;\r\n\r\nwith some other words that are difficult to understand. Next, below\r\nthis, in the border of this scene, are nine angels who are holding\r\nlegends both Italian and Latin in some suitable scrolls, put into that\r\nplace below because above they were like to spoil the scene, and not to\r\ninclude them in the work seemed wrong to their author, who considered\r\nthem very beautiful; and it may be that they were to the taste of that\r\nage. The greater part is omitted by us, in order not to weary others\r\nwith such things, which are not pertinent and little pleasing, not to\r\nmention that the greater part of these inscriptions being effaced, the\r\nremainder is little less than fragmentary. After these works, in making\r\nthe Judgment, Orcagna set Jesus Christ on high above the clouds in the\r\nmidst of His twelve Apostles, judging the quick and the dead; showing on\r\none side, with beautiful art and very vividly, the sorrowful expressions\r\nof the damned who are being dragged weeping by furious demons to Hell,\r\nand, on the other, the joy and the jubilation of the good, whom a body\r\nof angels guided by the Archangel Michael are leading as the elect, all\r\nrejoicing, to the right, where are the blessed. And it is truly a pity\r\nthat for lack of writers, in so great a multitude of men of the robe,\r\nchevaliers, and other lords, that are clearly depicted and portrayed\r\nthere from the life, there should be not one, or only very few, of whom\r\nwe know the names or who they were; although it is said that a Pope who\r\nis seen there is Innocent IV, friend[18] of Manfredi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDREA DI CIONE ORCAGNA: CHRIST ENTHRONED\r\n\r\n(_Florence: S. Maria Novella, Strozzi Chapel. Fresco_)]\r\n\r\nAfter this work, and after making some sculptures in marble for the\r\nMadonna that is on the abutment of the Ponte Vecchio, with great honour\r\nfor himself, he left his brother Bernardo to execute by himself a Hell\r\nin the Campo Santo, which is described by Dante, and which was\r\nafterwards spoilt in the year 1530 and restored by Sollazzino, a painter\r\nof our own times; and he returned to Florence, where, in the middle of\r\nthe Church of S. Croce, on a very great wall on the right, he painted in\r\nfresco the same subjects that he painted in the Campo Santo of Pisa, in\r\nthree similar pictures, excepting, however, the scene where S. Macarius\r\nis showing to three Kings the misery of man, and the life of the hermits\r\nwho are serving God on that mountain. Making, then, all the rest of that\r\nwork, he laboured therein with better design and more diligence than he\r\nhad done in Pisa, holding, nevertheless, to almost the same plan in the\r\ninvention, the manner, the scrolls, and the rest, without changing\r\nanything save the portraits from life, for those in this work were\r\npartly of his dearest friends, whom he placed in Paradise, and partly of\r\nmen little his friends, who were put by him in Hell. Among the good is\r\nseen portrayed from life in profile, with the triple crown on his head,\r\nPope Clement VI, who changed the Jubilee in his reign from every hundred\r\nto every fifty years, and was a friend of the Florentines, and had some\r\nof Orcagna's pictures, which were very dear to him. Among the same is\r\nMaestro Dino del Garbo, a most excellent physician of that time, dressed\r\nas was then the wont of doctors, with a red bonnet lined with miniver on\r\nhis head, and held by the hand by an angel; with many other portraits\r\nthat are not recognized. Among the damned he portrayed Guardi, serjeant\r\nof the Commune of Florence, being dragged along by the Devil with a\r\nhook, and he is known by three red lilies that he has on his white\r\nbonnet, such as were then wont to be worn by the serjeants and other\r\nsimilar officials; and this he did because Guardi once made distraint on\r\nhis property. He also portrayed there the notary and the judge who had\r\nbeen opposed to him in that action. Near to Guardi is Ceccho d'Ascoli, a\r\nfamous wizard of those times; and a little above--namely, in the\r\nmiddle--is a hypocrite friar, who, having issued from a tomb, is seeking\r\nfurtively to put himself among the good, while an angel discovers him\r\nand thrusts him among the damned.\r\n\r\nBesides Bernardo, Andrea had a brother called Jacopo, who was engaged in\r\nsculpture, but with little profit; and in making on occasion for this\r\nJacopo designs in relief and in clay, there came to him the wish to make\r\nsomething in marble and to see whether he remembered the principles of\r\nthat art, wherein, as it has been said, he had worked in Pisa; and so,\r\nputting himself with more study to the test, he made progress therein in\r\nsuch a fashion that afterwards he made use of it with honour, as it will\r\nbe told. Afterwards he devoted himself with all his energy to the study\r\nof architecture, thinking that at some time or another he would have to\r\nmake use of it. Nor did his thought deceive him, seeing that in the year\r\n1355, the Commune of Florence having bought some citizens' houses near\r\ntheir Palace (in order to have more space and to make a larger square,\r\nand also in order to make a place where the citizens could take shelter\r\nin rainy or wintry days, and carry on under cover such business as was\r\ntransacted on the Ringhiera when bad weather did not hinder), they\r\ncaused many designs to be made for the building of a magnificent and\r\nvery large Loggia for this purpose near the Palace, and at the same time\r\nfor the Mint where the money is struck. Among these designs, made by the\r\nbest masters in the city, that of Orcagna being universally approved and\r\naccepted as greater, more beautiful, and more magnificent than all the\r\nothers, by decree of the Signori and of the Commune there was begun\r\nunder his direction the great Loggia of the square, on the foundations\r\nmade in the time of the Duke of Athens, and it was carried on with\r\nsquared stone very well put together, with much diligence. And what was\r\nsomething new in those times, the arches of the vaulting were made no\r\nlonger quarter-acute, as it had been the custom up to that time, but\r\nthey were turned in half-circles in a new and laudable method, which\r\ngave much grace and beauty to this great fabric, which was brought to\r\ncompletion in a short time under the direction of Andrea. And if there\r\nhad been taken thought to put it beside S. Romolo and to turn the arches\r\nwith the back to the north, which they did not do, perchance, in order\r\nto have it conveniently near to the gate of the Palace, it would have\r\nbeen as useful a building for the whole city as it is beautiful in\r\nworkmanship; whereas, by reason of the great wind, in winter no one\r\ncan stand there. In this Loggia, between the arches on the front wall,\r\nin some ornamental work by his own hand, Orcagna made seven marble\r\nfigures in half-relief representing the seven Theological and Cardinal\r\nVirtues, as accompaniment to the whole work, so beautiful that they made\r\nhim known for no less able as sculptor than as painter and architect;\r\nnot to mention that he was in all his actions as pleasant, courteous,\r\nand lovable a man as was ever any man of his condition. And because he\r\nwould never abandon the study of any one of his professions for that of\r\nanother, while the Loggia was building he made a panel in distemper with\r\nmany large figures, with little figures in the predella, for that chapel\r\nof the Strozzi wherein he had formerly made some works in fresco with\r\nhis brother Bernardo; on which panel, it appearing to him that it could\r\nbear better testimony to his profession than the works wrought in fresco\r\ncould do, he wrote his name with these words: ANNO DOMINI MCCCLVII,\r\nANDREAS CIONIS DE FLORENTIA ME PINXIT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH AND ASSUMPTION OF THE VIRGIN\r\n\r\n(_Relief on the Tabernacle by_ Andrea di Cione Orcagna, _Or San Michele,\r\nFlorence_)]\r\n\r\nThis work completed, he made some pictures, also on panel, which were\r\nsent to the Pope in Avignon and are still in the Cathedral Church of\r\nthat city. A little while afterwards the men of the Company of\r\nOrsanmichele, having collected large sums of money from offerings and\r\ndonations given to their Madonna by reason of the mortality of 1348,\r\nresolved to make round her a chapel, or rather shrine, not only very\r\nornate and rich with marbles carved in every way and with other stones\r\nof price, but also with mosaic and ornaments of bronze, as much as could\r\npossibly be desired, in a manner that both in workmanship and in\r\nmaterial it might surpass every other work of so great a size wrought up\r\nto that day. Wherefore, the charge of the whole being given to Orcagna\r\nas the most excellent of that age, he made so many designs that finally\r\none of them pleased the authorities, as being better than all the\r\nothers. The work, therefore, being allotted to him, they put complete\r\nreliance in his judgment and counsel; wherefore, giving the making of\r\nall the rest to diverse master-carvers brought from several districts,\r\nhe applied himself with his brother to executing all the figures of the\r\nwork, and, the whole being finished, he had them built in and put\r\ntogether very thoughtfully without mortar, with clamps of copper fixed\r\nwith lead, to the end that the shining and polished marbles might not\r\nbecome discoloured; and in this he succeeded so well, with profit and\r\nhonour from those who came after him, that to one who studies that work\r\nit appears, by reason of such union and methods of joining discovered by\r\nOrcagna, that the whole chapel has been shaped out of one single piece\r\nof marble. And although it is in a German manner, for that style it has\r\nso great grace and proportion that it holds the first place among the\r\nworks of those times, above all because its composition of figures great\r\nand small, and of angels and prophets in half-relief round the Madonna,\r\nis very well executed. Marvellous, also, is the casting of the bands of\r\nbronze, diligently polished, which, encircling the whole work, enclose\r\nand bind it together in a manner that it is therefore as stout and\r\nstrong as it is beautiful in all other respects. But how much he\r\nlaboured in order to show the subtlety of his intellect in that gross\r\nage is seen in a large scene in half-relief on the back part of the said\r\nshrine, wherein, with figures of one braccio and a half each, he made\r\nthe twelve Apostles gazing on high at the Madonna, while she, in an oval\r\nspace, surrounded by angels, is ascending to Heaven. In one of these\r\nApostles he portrayed himself in marble, old, as he was, with the beard\r\nshaven, with the cap wound round the head, and with the face flat and\r\nround, as it is seen above in his portrait, drawn from that one. Besides\r\nthis, he inscribed these words in the marble below: ANDREAS CIONIS,\r\nPICTOR FLORENTINUS, ORATORII ARCHIMAGISTER EXTITIT HUJUS, MCCCLIX.\r\n\r\nIt is known that the building of this Loggia and of the marble shrine,\r\nwith all the master-work, cost ninety-six thousand florins of gold,\r\nwhich were very well spent, for the reason that it is, both in the\r\narchitecture and in the sculptures and other ornaments, as beautiful as\r\nany other work whatsoever of those times, and is such that, by reason of\r\nthe parts made therein by him, the name of Andrea Orcagna has been and\r\nwill be ever living and great.\r\n\r\nHe used to write in his pictures: FECE ANDREA DI CIONE, SCULTORE; and in\r\nhis sculptures: FECE ANDREA DI CIONE, PITTORE; wishing that his painting\r\nshould be known by his sculpture, and his sculpture by his painting.\r\nThere are throughout all Florence many panels made by him, which are\r\npartly known by the name, such as a panel in S. Romeo, and partly by the\r\nmanner, such as one that is in the Chapter-house of the Monastery of the\r\nAngeli. Some of them that he left unfinished were completed by Bernardo,\r\nhis brother, who survived him, but not for many years. And because, as\r\nit has been said, Andrea delighted in making verses and various forms of\r\npoetry, when already old he wrote some sonnets to Burchiello, then a\r\nyouth; and finally, being sixty years of age, he finished the course of\r\nhis life in 1389, and was borne with honour from his dwelling, which was\r\nin the Via Vecchia de' Corazzai, to his tomb.\r\n\r\nThere were many men able in sculpture and in architecture at the same\r\ntime as Orcagna, of whom the names are not known, but their works are to\r\nbe seen, and these are worthy of nothing but praise and commendation.\r\nAmong their works is not only the Monastery of the Certosa of Florence,\r\nmade at the expense of the noble family of the Acciaiuoli, and in\r\nparticular of Messer Niccola, Grand Seneschal of the King of Naples, but\r\nalso the tomb of the same man, whereon he is portrayed in stone, and\r\nthat of his father and one of his sisters, which has a covering of\r\nmarble, whereon both were portrayed very well from nature in the year\r\n1366. There, too, wrought by the hand of the same men, is the tomb of\r\nMesser Lorenzo, son of the said Niccola, who, dying at Naples, was\r\nbrought to Florence and laid to rest there with the most honourable pomp\r\nof funeral obsequies. In like manner, in the tomb of Cardinal Santa\r\nCroce of the same family, which is in a choir then built anew in front\r\nof the high-altar, there is his portrait on a slab of marble, very well\r\nwrought in the year 1390.\r\n\r\nDisciples of Andrea in painting were Bernardo Nello di Giovanni Falconi\r\nof Pisa, who wrought many panels in the Duomo of Pisa, and Tommaso di\r\nMarco of Florence, who, besides many other works, made in the year 1392\r\na panel that is in S. Antonio in Pisa, set up against the tramezzo[19]\r\nof the church.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Andrea, his brother Jacopo, occupied himself in\r\nsculpture, as it has been said, and in architecture, was employed in the\r\nyear 1328 on the foundation and building of the Tower and Gate of S.\r\nPiero Gattolini, and it is said that he made the four marzocchi[20] of\r\nstone which were placed on the four corners of the Palazzo Principale of\r\nFlorence, all overlaid with gold. This work was much censured, by reason\r\nof there being laid on those places, without necessity, a greater weight\r\nthan peradventure was expedient; and many would have been pleased to\r\nhave the marzocchi made rather of plates of copper, hollow within, and\r\nthen, after being gilded in the fire, set up in the same place, because\r\nthey would have been much less heavy and more durable. It is said, too,\r\nthat the same man made the horse, gilded and in full relief, that is in\r\nS. Maria del Fiore, over the door that leads to the Company of S.\r\nZanobi, which horse is believed to be there in memory of Piero Farnese,\r\nCaptain of the Florentines; however, knowing nothing more about this, I\r\ncould not vouch for it. About the same time Mariotto, nephew of Andrea,\r\nmade in fresco the Paradise of S. Michele Bisdomini, in the Via de'\r\nServi in Florence, and the panel with an Annunciation that is on the\r\naltar; and for Monna Cecilia de' Boscoli he made another panel with many\r\nfigures, placed near the door of the same church.\r\n\r\nBut among all the disciples of Orcagna none was more excellent than\r\nFrancesco Traini, who made a panel with a ground of gold for a nobleman\r\nof the house of Coscia, who is buried at Pisa in the Chapel of S.\r\nDomenico, in the Church of S. Caterina; which panel contained a S.\r\nDominic standing two braccia and a half high, with six scenes of his\r\nlife on either side of him, animated and vivacious and well coloured.\r\nAnd in the same church, in the Chapel of S. Tommaso d'Aquino, he made a\r\npanel in distemper with fanciful invention, which is much praised,\r\nplacing therein the said S. Thomas seated, portrayed from the life: I\r\nsay from the life, because the friars of that place had an image of him\r\nbrought from the Abbey of Fossa Nuova, where he died in the year 1323.\r\nBelow, round S. Thomas, who is placed seated in the air with some books\r\nin his hand, which are illuminating the Christian people with their rays\r\nand lustre, there are kneeling a great number of doctors and clergy of\r\nevery sort, Bishops, Cardinals, and Popes, among whom is the portrait\r\nof Pope Urban VI. Under the feet of S. Thomas are standing Sabellius,\r\nArius, Averroes, and other heretics and philosophers, with their books\r\nall torn; and the said figure of S. Thomas is placed between Plato, who\r\nis showing him the _Timaeus_, and Aristotle, who is showing him the\r\n_Ethics_. Above, a Jesus Christ, in like manner in the air between the\r\nfour Evangelists, is blessing S. Thomas, and appears to be in the act of\r\nsending down upon him the Holy Spirit, and filling him with it and with\r\nHis grace. This work, when finished, acquired very great fame and praise\r\nfor Francesco Traini, for in making it he surpassed his master Andrea by\r\na great measure in colouring, in harmony, and in invention. This Andrea\r\nwas very diligent in his drawings, as it may be seen in our book.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nS. THOMAS AQUINAS\r\n\r\n(_After the painting by_ Francesco Traini. _Pisa: Church of S.\r\nCaterina_)]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: This is probably a printer's error for \"nemico,\" as that\r\nPope was anything but the friend of Manfredi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: See note on p. 57.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Lions of stone, emblems of the city of Florence.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMMASO, CALLED GIOTTINO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF TOMMASO, CALLED GIOTTINO,\r\n\r\nPAINTER OF FLORENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen those arts that proceed from design come into competition and their\r\ncraftsmen work in rivalry, without doubt the good intellects, exercising\r\nthemselves with much study, discover new things every day in order to\r\nsatisfy the various tastes of men; and some, speaking for the present of\r\npainting, executing works obscure and unusual and demonstrating in them\r\nthe difficulty of making them, make known by the shadows the brightness\r\nof their genius. Others, fashioning the sweet and delicate, thinking\r\nthese to be likely to be more pleasing to the eyes of all who behold\r\nthem by reason of their having more relief, easily attract to themselves\r\nthe minds of the greater part of men. Others, again, painting with unity\r\nand lowering the tones of the colours, reducing to their proper places\r\nthe lights and shades of their figures, deserve very great praise, and\r\nreveal the thoughts of the intellect with beautiful dexterity of mind;\r\neven as they were ever revealed with a sweet manner in the works of\r\nTommaso di Stefano, called Giottino, who, being born in the year 1324\r\nand having learnt from his father the first principles of painting,\r\nresolved while still very young to attempt, in so far as he might be\r\nable with assiduous study, to be an imitator of the manner of Giotto\r\nrather than of that of his father Stefano. In this attempt he succeeded\r\nso well that he gained thereby, besides the manner, which was much more\r\nbeautiful than that of his master, the surname of Giottino, which never\r\nleft him; nay, by reason both of the manner and of the name it was the\r\nopinion of many, who, however, were in very great error, that he was the\r\nson of Giotto; but in truth it is not so, it being certain, or to speak\r\nmore exactly, believed (it being impossible for such things to be\r\naffirmed by any man) that he was the son of Stefano, painter of\r\nFlorence.\r\n\r\nHe was, then, so diligent in painting and so greatly devoted to it,\r\nthat, although many of his works are not to be found, those nevertheless\r\nthat have been found are good and in a beautiful manner, for the reason\r\nthat the draperies, the hair, the beards, and all the rest of his work\r\nwere made and harmonized with so great softness and diligence, that it\r\nis seen that without doubt he added harmony to this art and had it much\r\nmore perfect than his master Giotto and his father Stefano. In his youth\r\nGiottino painted a chapel near the side-door of S. Stefano al Ponte\r\nVecchio in Florence, wherein, although it is to-day much spoilt by damp,\r\nthe little that has remained shows the dexterity and the genius of the\r\ncraftsman. Next, he made the two Saints, Cosimo and Damiano, for the\r\nFrati Ermini in the Canto alla Macine, but little is seen of them\r\nto-day, for they too have been ruined by time. And he wrought in fresco\r\na chapel in the old S. Spirito in that city, which was afterwards ruined\r\nin the burning of that church; and in fresco, over the principal door of\r\nthe church, the story of the Sending of the Holy Spirit; and on the\r\nsquare before the said church, on the way to the Canto alla Cuculia, on\r\nthe corner of the convent, he painted that shrine that is still seen\r\nthere, with Our Lady and other Saints round her, wherein both the heads\r\nand the other parts lean strongly towards the modern manner, for the\r\nreason that he sought to vary and to blend the flesh-colours, and to\r\nharmonize all the figures with grace and judgment by means of a variety\r\nof colours and draperies. In like manner he wrought the stories of\r\nConstantine with much diligence in the Chapel of S. Silvestro in S.\r\nCroce, showing very beautiful ideas in the gestures of the figures; and\r\nthen, behind an ornament of marble made for the tomb of Messer Bertino\r\nde' Bardi, a man who at that time had held honourable military rank, he\r\nmade this Messer Bertino in armour, after the life, issuing from a\r\nsepulchre on his knees, being summoned with the sound of the trumpets of\r\nthe Judgment by two angels, who are in the air accompanying a\r\nbeautifully-wrought Christ in the clouds. On the right hand of the\r\nentrance of the door of S. Pancrazio the same man made a Christ who is\r\nbearing His Cross, and some Saints near Him, that have exactly the\r\nmanner of Giotto. In S. Gallo (which convent was without the Gate called\r\nby the same name, and was destroyed in the siege) in a cloister, there\r\nwas a Pieta painted in fresco, whereof there is a copy in the aforesaid\r\nS. Pancrazio, on a pillar beside the principal chapel. In S. Maria\r\nNovella, in the Chapel of S. Lorenzo de' Giuochi, as one enters by the\r\ndoor on the left, on the front wall, he wrought in fresco a S. Cosimo\r\nand a S. Damiano, and, in Ognissanti, a S. Christopher and a S. George,\r\nwhich were spoilt by the malice of time, and then restored by other\r\npainters by reason of the ignorance of a Provost little conversant with\r\nsuch matters. In the said church there has remained whole the arch that\r\nis over the door of the sacristy, wherein there is in fresco a Madonna\r\nwith the Child in her arms by the hand of Tommaso, which is a good work,\r\nby reason of his having wrought it with diligence.\r\n\r\nBy means of these works Giottino had acquired so good a name, imitating\r\nhis master both in design and in invention, as it has been told, that\r\nthere was said to be in him the spirit of Giotto himself, both because\r\nof the vividness of his colouring and of his mastery in draughtsmanship;\r\nand in the year 1343, on July 2, when the Duke of Athens was driven out\r\nby the people and when he had renounced the sovereignty and restored\r\ntheir liberty to the Florentines, Giottino was forced by the twelve\r\nReformers of the State, and in particular by the prayers of Messer\r\nAgnolo Acciaiuoli, then a very great citizen, who had great influence\r\nwith him, to paint in contempt, on the tower of the Palace of the\r\nPodesta, the said Duke and his followers, who were Messer Ceritieri\r\nVisdomini, Messer Maladiasse, his Conservator, and Messer Ranieri da San\r\nGimignano, all with the cap of Justice ignominiously on their heads.\r\nRound the head of the Duke were many beasts of prey and other sorts,\r\nsignifying his nature and his character; and one of those his\r\ncounsellors had in his hand the Palace of the Priors of the city, and\r\nwas handing it to him, like a disloyal traitor to his country. And all\r\nhad below them the arms and emblems of their families, and some writings\r\nwhich can hardly be read to-day because they have been eaten away by\r\ntime. In this work, both by reason of the draughtsmanship and of the\r\ngreat diligence wherewith it was executed, the manner of the craftsman\r\ngave universal pleasure to all. Afterwards, at the Campora, a seat of\r\nthe Black Friars without the Porta a S. Piero Gattolini, he made a S.\r\nCosimo and a S. Damiano, which were spoilt in the whitewashing of the\r\nchurch; and on the bridge of Romiti in Valdarno he painted in fresco the\r\nshrine that is built over the middle, with his own hand and in a\r\nbeautiful manner.\r\n\r\nIt is found recorded by many who wrote thereon that Tommaso applied\r\nhimself to sculpture and wrought a figure in marble on the Campanile of\r\nS. Maria del Fiore in Florence, four braccia high and facing the place\r\nwhere the Orphans now dwell. In S. Giovanni Laterano in Rome, likewise,\r\nhe brought to fine completion a scene wherein he represented the Pope in\r\nseveral capacities, which is now seen to have been eaten away and\r\ncorroded by time; and in the house of the Orsini he painted a hall full\r\nof famous men; with a very beautiful S. Louis on a pillar in the\r\nAraceli, on the right hand beside the altar.\r\n\r\nIn the lower church of S. Francesco at Assisi, in an arch over the\r\npulpit (there being no other space that was not painted) he wrought the\r\nCoronation of Our Lady, with many angels round her, so gracious, so\r\nbeautiful in the expressions of the faces, and so sweet and delicate in\r\nmanner, that they show, with the usual harmony of colour which was\r\nsomething peculiar to this painter, that he had proved himself the peer\r\nof all who had lived up to that time; and round this arch he made some\r\nstories of S. Nicholas. In like manner, in the Monastery of S. Chiara in\r\nthe same city, in the middle of the church, he painted a scene in\r\nfresco, wherein is S. Chiara supported in the air by two angels who\r\nappear real; she is restoring to life a child that was dead, while round\r\nher are standing many women all full of wonder, with great beauty in the\r\nfaces and in the very gracious head-dresses and costumes of those times\r\nthat they are wearing. In the same city of Assisi, over the gate of the\r\ncity that leads to the Duomo--namely, in an arch on the inner side--he\r\nmade a Madonna with the Child in her arms, with so great diligence that\r\nshe appears alive, and a S. Francis and another Saint, both very\r\nbeautiful; both of which works, although the story of S. Chiara\r\nremained unfinished by reason of Tommaso having fallen sick and returned\r\nto Florence, are perfect and most worthy of all praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIOTTINO: THE DESCENT FROM THE CROSS\r\n\r\n(_Florence: Uffizi 27. Panel_)]\r\n\r\nIt is said that Tommaso was melancholic in temperament and very\r\nsolitary, but with respect to art devoted and very studious, as it is\r\nclearly seen from a panel in the Church of S. Romeo in Florence, wrought\r\nby him in distemper with so great diligence and love that there has\r\nnever been seen a better work on wood by his hand. In this panel, which\r\nis placed in the tramezzo[21] of the church, on the right hand, is a\r\nDead Christ with the Maries and Nicodemus, accompanied by other figures,\r\nwho are bewailing His death with bitterness and with very sweet and\r\naffectionate movements, wringing their hands with diverse gestures, and\r\nbeating themselves in a manner that in the air of the faces there is\r\nshown very clearly their sharp sorrow at the so great cost of our sins.\r\nAnd it is something marvellous to consider, not that he penetrated with\r\nhis genius to such a height of imagination, but that he could express it\r\nso well with the brush. Wherefore this work is consummately worthy of\r\npraise, not so much by reason of the subject and of the invention, as\r\nbecause in it the craftsman has shown, in some heads that are weeping,\r\nthat although the lineaments of those that are weeping are distorted in\r\nthe brows, in the eyes, in the nose, and in the mouth, this, however,\r\nneither spoils nor alters a certain beauty which is wont to suffer much\r\nin weeping when the painters do not know well how to avail themselves of\r\nthe good methods of art. But it is no great thing that Giottino should\r\nhave executed this panel with so much consideration, since in his\r\nlabours he ever aimed rather at fame and glory than at any other reward,\r\nbeing free from the greed of gain, that makes our present masters less\r\ndiligent and good. And even as he did not seek to have great riches, so\r\nhe did not trouble himself much about the comforts of life--nay, living\r\npoorly, he sought to satisfy others rather than himself; wherefore,\r\ntaking little care of himself and enduring fatigue, he died of\r\nconsumption at the age of thirty-two, and was given burial by his\r\nrelatives at the Martello Gate without S. Maria Novella, beside the tomb\r\nof Bontura.\r\n\r\nDisciples of Giottino, who left more fame than wealth, were Giovanni\r\nTossicani of Arezzo, Michelino, Giovanni dal Ponte, and Lippo, who were\r\npassing good masters of this art, but above all Giovanni Tossicani, who\r\nmade many works throughout all Tuscany after Tommaso and in the same\r\nmanner as his, and in particular the Chapel of S. Maria Maddalena,\r\nbelonging to the Tuccerelli, in the Pieve of Arezzo, and a S. James on a\r\npillar in the Pieve of the township of Empoli. In the Duomo of Pisa,\r\nalso, he wrought some panels which have since been removed in order to\r\nmake room for the modern. The last work that he made was in a chapel of\r\nthe Vescovado of Arezzo, for the Countess Giovanna, wife of Tarlato da\r\nPietramala--namely, a very beautiful Annunciation, with S. James and S.\r\nPhilip; which work, by reason of the back of the wall being turned to\r\nthe north, was little less than completely spoilt by damp, when Maestro\r\nAgnolo di Lorenzo of Arezzo restored the Annunciation, and shortly\r\nafterwards Giorgio Vasari, still a youth, restored the S. James and S.\r\nPhilip, to his own great profit, having learnt much, at that time when\r\nhe had not the advantage of other masters, by studying Giovanni's method\r\nof painting and the shadows and colours of that work, spoilt as it was.\r\nIn this chapel there are still read these words in an epitaph of marble,\r\nin memory of the Countess who had it built and painted:\r\n\r\n     ANNO DOMINI 1335, DE MENSE AUGUSTI, HANC CAPELLAM CONSTITUI FECIT\r\n     NOBILIS DOMINA COMITISSA JOANNA DE SANCTA FLORA, UXOR NOBILIS\r\n     MILITIS DOMINI TARLATI DE PETRAMALA, AD HONOREM BEATAE MARIAE\r\n     VIRGINIS.\r\n\r\nOf the works of the other disciples of Giottino there is no mention\r\nmade, seeing that they were but ordinary and little like those of the\r\nmaster and of Giovanni Tossicani, their fellow-disciple. Tommaso drew\r\nvery well, as it may be seen in our book, in certain drawings wrought by\r\nhis hand with much diligence.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: See note on p. 57.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI DAL PONTE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF GIOVANNI DAL PONTE,\r\n\r\nPAINTER OF FLORENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no truth and not much confidence to be placed in the\r\nancient proverb that the prodigal's purse is never empty, and although,\r\non the contrary, it is very true that he who does not live a\r\nwell-ordered life in his own degree lives at the last in want and dies\r\nmiserably, it is seen, nevertheless, that fortune sometimes aids rather\r\nthose who squander without restraint than those who are in all things\r\ncareful and self-restrained; and when the favour of fortune ceases,\r\nthere often comes death, to make up for her defection and for the bad\r\nmanagement of men, supervening at the very moment when such men would\r\nbegin with infinite dismay to recognize how miserable a thing it is to\r\nhave squandered in youth and to want in old age, living and labouring in\r\npoverty, as would have happened to Giovanni da Santo Stefano a Ponte of\r\nFlorence, if, after having consumed his patrimony and much gain which\r\nhad been brought to his hands rather by fortune than by his merits, with\r\nsome inheritances that came to him from an unexpected source, he had not\r\nfinished at one and the same time the course of his life and all his\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nThis man, then, who was a disciple of Buonamico Buffalmacco, and who\r\nimitated him more in attending to the pleasures of life than in seeking\r\nto become an able painter, was born in the year 1307, and after being in\r\nearly youth a disciple of Buffalmacco, he made his first works in the\r\nChapel of S. Lorenzo, in the Pieve of Empoli, painting there in fresco\r\nmany scenes of the life of that Saint, with so great diligence that he\r\nwas summoned to Arezzo in the year 1344, a better development being\r\nexpected after so fine a beginning; and there he painted the Assumption\r\nof Our Lady in a chapel in S. Francesco. And a little time afterwards,\r\nbeing in some credit in that city for lack of other painters, he\r\npainted the Chapel of S. Onofrio in the Pieve, with that of S. Antonio,\r\nwhich to-day is spoilt by damp. He also made some other pictures that\r\nwere in S. Giustina and in S. Matteo, but these were thrown to the\r\nground by Duke Cosimo, together with the said churches, in the making of\r\nfortifications for that city; and exactly in that place, at the foot of\r\nthe abutment of an ancient bridge beside the said S. Giustina, where the\r\nstream entered the city, there were then found a head of Appius Caecus\r\nand one of his son, both in marble and very beautiful, with an ancient\r\nepitaph, likewise very beautiful, which are all now in the\r\nguardaroba[22] of the said Lord Duke.\r\n\r\nGiovanni, having returned to Florence at the time when there was\r\nfinished the closing of the middle arch of the Ponte a S. Trinita,\r\npainted many figures both within and without a chapel built over one\r\npier and dedicated to S. Michelagnolo, and in particular all the front\r\nwall; which chapel, together with the bridge, was carried away by the\r\nflood of the year 1557. It is by reason of these works that some\r\nmaintain, besides what has been said about him at the beginning, that he\r\nwas ever afterwards called Giovanni dal Ponte. In Pisa, also, in the\r\nyear 1355, he made some scenes in fresco behind the altar of the\r\nprincipal chapel of S. Paolo a Ripa d'Arno, which are now all spoilt by\r\ndamp and by time. Giovanni also painted the Chapel of the Scali in S.\r\nTrinita in Florence, with another that is beside it, and one of the\r\nstories of S. Paul by the side of the principal chapel, where is the\r\ntomb of Maestro Paolo, the astrologer. In S. Stefano al Ponte Vecchio he\r\npainted a panel, with other pictures in distemper and in fresco both\r\nwithin and without Florence, which brought him considerable credit.\r\n\r\nHe gave contentment to his friends, but more in his pleasures than in\r\nhis works, and he was the friend of men of learning, and in particular\r\nof all those who pursued the studies of his own profession in order to\r\nbecome excellent therein; and although he had not sought to have in\r\nhimself that which he desired in others, yet he never ceased to\r\nencourage others to work valiantly. Finally, having lived fifty-nine\r\nyears, Giovanni was seized by pleurisy and in a few days departed\r\nthis life, wherein, had he survived a little longer, he would have\r\nsuffered many discomforts, there being left in his house scarce as much\r\nas sufficed to give him decent burial in S. Stefano al Ponte Vecchio.\r\nHis works date about 1365.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nS. PETER ENTHRONED\r\n\r\n(_After the painting by_ Giovanni dal Ponte. _Florence: Uffizi, 1292_)]\r\n\r\nIn our book of drawings by diverse ancients and moderns there is a\r\ndrawing in water-colour by the hand of Giovanni, wherein is a S. George\r\non horseback who is slaying the Dragon, and a skeleton, which bear\r\nwitness to the method and manner that he had in drawing.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Guardaroba, the room or rooms where everything of value\r\nwas stored--clothes, linen, art treasures, furniture, etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGNOLO GADDI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF AGNOLO GADDI,\r\n\r\nPAINTER OF FLORENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nHow honourable and profitable it is to be excellent in a noble art is\r\nmanifestly seen in the talent and management of Taddeo Gaddi, who,\r\nhaving acquired very good means as well as fame with his industry and\r\nlabours, left the affairs of his family so well arranged, when he passed\r\nto the other life, that Agnolo and Giovanni, his sons, were easily able\r\nto give a beginning to the very great riches and to the exaltation of\r\nthe house of Gaddi, to-day very noble in Florence and in great repute\r\nthroughout all Christendom. And in truth it has been very reasonable,\r\nseeing that Gaddo, Taddeo, Agnolo, and Giovanni adorned many honoured\r\nchurches with their talent and their art, that their successors have\r\nbeen since adorned by the Holy Roman Church and by the Supreme Pontiffs\r\nof the same with the greatest ecclesiastical dignities.\r\n\r\nTaddeo, then, of whom we have already written the Life, left his sons\r\nAgnolo and Giovanni in company with many of his disciples, hoping that\r\nAgnolo, in particular, would become very excellent in painting; but he,\r\nwho in his youth showed promise of surpassing his father by a great\r\nmeasure, did not succeed further in justifying the opinion that had\r\nalready been conceived of him, for the reason that, being born and bred\r\nin easy circumstances, which are often an impediment to study, he was\r\ngiven more to traffic and to trading than to the art of painting; which\r\nshould not appear a thing new or strange, seeing that avarice very often\r\nbars the way to many intellects which would ascend to the greatest\r\nheight of excellence, if the desire of gain did not impede their path in\r\ntheir earliest and best years. Working as a youth in S. Jacopo tra'\r\nFossi in Florence, Agnolo wrought a little scene, with figures little\r\nmore than a braccio high, of Christ raising Lazarus on the fourth day\r\nafter death, wherein, imagining the corruption of that body, which had\r\nbeen dead three days, with much thought he made the grave-clothes which\r\nheld him bound discoloured by the decay of the flesh, and round the eyes\r\ncertain livid and yellowish marks in the flesh, that seems half living\r\nand half dead; not without stupefaction in the Apostles and in other\r\nfigures, who, with attitudes varied and beautiful, and with their\r\ndraperies to their noses in order not to feel the stench of that corrupt\r\nbody, are no less afraid and awestruck at such a marvellous miracle than\r\nMary and Martha are joyful and content to see life returning to the dead\r\nbody of their brother. This work was judged so excellent that many\r\ndeemed the talent of Agnolo to be destined to surpass all the disciples\r\nof Taddeo, and even Taddeo himself; but the event proved otherwise,\r\nbecause, even as in youth the will conquers every difficulty in order to\r\nacquire fame, so a certain negligence that the years bring with them\r\noften causes a man, instead of advancing, to go backwards, as did\r\nAgnolo. Having given so great a proof of his talent, he was commissioned\r\nby the family of Soderini, who had great hopes of him, to paint the\r\nprincipal chapel of the Carmine, and he painted therein all the life of\r\nOur Lady, so much less well than he had done the resurrection of\r\nLazarus, that he gave every man to know that he had little wish to\r\nattend with every effort to the art of painting; for the reason that in\r\nall that great work there is nothing else of the good save one scene,\r\nwherein, round Our Lady, in a room, are many maidens who are wearing\r\ndiverse costumes and head-dresses, according to the diversity of the use\r\nof those times, and are engaged in diverse exercises: this one is\r\nspinning, that one is sewing, that other is winding thread, one is\r\nweaving, and others working in other ways, all passing well conceived\r\nand executed by Agnolo.\r\n\r\nFor the noble family of the Alberti, likewise, he painted in fresco the\r\nprincipal chapel of the Church of S. Croce, making therein all that came\r\nto pass in the discovery of the Cross, and he executed that work with\r\nmuch mastery of handling but not with much design, for only the\r\ncolouring is beautiful and good enough. Next, in painting in fresco some\r\nstories of S. Louis in the Chapel of the Bardi in the same church, he\r\nacquitted himself much better. And because he used to work by caprice,\r\nnow with more zeal and now with less, working in S. Spirito, also in\r\nFlorence, within the door that leads from the square into the convent,\r\nhe made in fresco, over another door, a Madonna with the Child in her\r\narms, and S. Augustine and S. Nicholas, so well that the said figures\r\nappear as if made only yesterday.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MARRIAGE OF S. CATHARINE\r\n\r\n(_After the painting by_ Agnolo Gaddi. _Philadelphia, U.S.A.: J. G.\r\nJohnson Collection_)]\r\n\r\nAnd because in a certain manner there had come to Agnolo, by way of\r\ninheritance, the secret of working in mosaic, and he had at home the\r\ninstruments and all the materials that his grandfather Gaddo had used in\r\nthis, he would make something in mosaic when it pleased him, merely to\r\npass time and by reason of that convenience of material, rather than for\r\naught else. Now, seeing that time had eaten away many of those marbles\r\nthat cover the eight faces of the roof of S. Giovanni, and that the damp\r\npenetrating within had therefore spoilt much of the mosaic which Andrea\r\nTafi had wrought there at a former time, the Consuls of the Guild of\r\nMerchants determined, to the end that the rest might not be spoilt, to\r\nrebuild the greater part of that covering with marble, and in like\r\nmanner to have the mosaic restored. Wherefore, the direction and\r\ncommission for the whole being given to Agnolo, he, in the year 1346,\r\nhad it recovered with new marbles and the pieces laid over each other at\r\nthe joinings, with unexampled diligence, to the breadth of two fingers,\r\ncutting each slab to the half of its thickness; then, joining them\r\ntogether with cement made of mastic and wax melted together, he fitted\r\nthem with so great diligence that from that time onwards neither the\r\nroof nor the vaulting has received any damage from the rains. Agnolo,\r\nhaving afterwards restored the mosaic, brought it about by means of his\r\ncounsel and of a design very well conceived that there was rebuilt,\r\nround the said church, all the upper cornice of marble below the roof,\r\nin that form wherein it now remains; which cornice was much smaller than\r\nit is and very commonplace. Under direction of the same man there was\r\nalso made the vaulting of the Great Hall of the Palace of the Podesta,\r\nwhich before was directly under the roof, to the end that, besides the\r\nadornment, fire might not again be able to do it damage, as it had done\r\na long time before. After this, by the counsel of Agnolo, there were\r\nmade round the said Palace the battlements that are there to-day, which\r\nbefore were in no wise there.\r\n\r\nThe while that these works were executing, he did not desert his\r\npainting entirely, and painted in distemper, in the panel that he made\r\nfor the high-altar of S. Pancrazio, Our Lady, S. John the Baptist, and\r\nthe Evangelist, and beside them the Saints Nereus, Archileus, and\r\nPancratius, brothers, with other Saints. But the best of this work--nay,\r\nall that is seen therein of the good--is the predella alone, which is\r\nall full of little figures, divided into eight stories of the Madonna\r\nand of S. Reparata. Next, in 1348, he painted the panel of the\r\nhigh-altar of S. Maria Maggiore, also in Florence, for Barone Cappelli,\r\nmaking therein a passing good dance of angels round a Coronation of Our\r\nLady. A little afterwards, in the Pieve of the district of Prato,\r\nrebuilt under direction of Giovanni Pisano in the year 1312, as it has\r\nbeen said above, Agnolo painted in fresco, in the chapel wherein was\r\ndeposited the Girdle of Our Lady, many scenes of her life; and in other\r\nchurches of that district, which was full of monasteries and convents\r\nheld in great honour, he made other works in plenty. In Florence, next,\r\nhe painted the arch over the door of S. Romeo; and in Orto S. Michele he\r\nwrought in distemper a Disputation of the Doctors with Christ in the\r\nTemple. And at the same time, many houses having been pulled down in\r\norder to enlarge the Piazza de' Signori, and in particular the Church of\r\nS. Romolo, this was rebuilt with the design of Agnolo. There are many\r\npanels by his hand throughout the churches in the said city, and many of\r\nhis works may also be recognized in the domain, which were wrought by\r\nhim with much profit to himself, although he worked more in order to do\r\nas his forefathers had done than for any love of it, having his mind\r\ndirected on commerce, which brought him better profit; as it is seen\r\nwhen his sons, not wishing any longer to be painters, gave themselves\r\nover completely to commerce, holding a house open for this purpose in\r\nVenice together with their father, who, from a certain time onward, did\r\nnot work save for his own pleasure, and, in a certain manner, in order\r\nto pass time. Having thus acquired great wealth by means of trading and\r\nby means of his art, Agnolo died in the sixty-third year of his life,\r\novercome by a malignant fever which in a few days made an end of him.\r\n\r\nHis disciples were Maestro Antonio da Ferrara, who made many beautiful\r\nworks in S. Francesco at Urbino, and at Citta di Castello; and Stefano\r\nda Verona, who painted in fresco most perfectly, as it is seen in many\r\nplaces at Verona, his native city, and also in many of his works at\r\nMantua. This man, among other things, was excellent in giving very\r\nbeautiful expressions to the faces of children, of women, and of old\r\nmen, as it may be seen in his works, which were all imitated and copied\r\nby that Piero da Perugia, illuminator, who illuminated all the books\r\nthat are in the library of Pope Pius in the Duomo at Siena, and was a\r\npractised colourist in fresco. A disciple of Agnolo, also, was Michele\r\nda Milano, as was Giovanni Gaddi, his brother, who made, in the cloister\r\nof S. Spirito where are the little arches of Gaddo and of Taddeo, the\r\nDisputation of Christ in the Temple with the Doctors, the Purification\r\nof the Virgin, the Temptation of Christ in the Wilderness, and the\r\nBaptism of John; and finally, having created very great expectation, he\r\ndied. A pupil of the same Agnolo in painting was Cennino di Drea Cennini\r\nof Colle di Valdelsa, who, having very great affection for the art,\r\nwrote a book describing the methods of working in fresco, in distemper,\r\nin size, and in gum, and, besides, how illuminating is done, and all the\r\nmethods of applying gold; which book is in the hands of Giuliano,\r\ngoldsmith of Siena, an excellent master and a friend of these arts. And\r\nin the beginning of this his book he treated of the nature of colours,\r\nboth the minerals and the earth-colours, according as he learnt from\r\nAgnolo his master, wishing, for the reason perchance that he did not\r\nsucceed in learning to paint perfectly, at least to know the nature of\r\nthe colours, the distempers, the sizes, and the application of gesso,\r\nand what colours we must guard against as harmful in making the\r\nmixtures, and in short many other considerations whereof there is no\r\nneed to discourse, there being to-day a perfect knowledge of all those\r\nmatters which he held as great and very rare secrets in those times. But\r\nI will not forbear to say that he makes no mention (and perchance they\r\nmay not have been in use) of some earth-colours, such as dark red\r\nearths, cinabrese, and certain vitreous greens. Since then there have\r\nbeen also discovered umber, which is an earth-colour, giallo santo,[23]\r\nthe smalts both for fresco and for oils, and some vitreous greens and\r\nyellows, wherein the painters of that age were lacking. He treated\r\nfinally of mosaics, and of grinding colours in oils in order to make\r\ngrounds of red, blue, green, and in other manners; and of the mordants\r\nfor the application of gold, but not then for figures. Besides the works\r\nthat he wrought in Florence with his master, there is a Madonna with\r\ncertain saints by his hand under the loggia of the hospital of Bonifazio\r\nLupi, coloured in such a manner that it has been very well preserved up\r\nto our own day.\r\n\r\nThis Cennino, in the first chapter of his said book, speaking of\r\nhimself, uses these very words: \"I, Cennino di Drea Cennini, of Colle di\r\nValdelsa, was instructed in the said art for twelve years by Agnolo di\r\nTaddeo of Florence, my master, who learnt the said art from Taddeo, his\r\nfather, who was held at baptism by Giotto and was his disciple for\r\nfour-and-twenty years; which Giotto transmuted the art of painting from\r\nGreek into Latin, and brought it to the modern manner, and had it for\r\ncertain more perfected than anyone ever had it.\" These are the very\r\nwords of Cennino, to whom it appeared that even as those who translate\r\nany work from Greek into Latin confer very great benefit on those who do\r\nnot understand Greek, so, too, did Giotto in transforming the art of\r\npainting from a manner not understood or known by anyone, save perchance\r\nas very rude, to a beautiful, facile, and very pleasing manner,\r\nunderstood and known as good by all who have judgment and the least\r\ngrain of reason.\r\n\r\nAll these disciples of Agnolo did him very great honour, and he was\r\nburied by his sons, to whom it is said that he left the sum of fifty\r\nthousand florins or more, in S. Maria Novella, in the tomb that he\r\nhimself had made for himself and for his descendants, in the year of our\r\nsalvation 1387. The portrait of Agnolo, made by himself, is seen in the\r\nChapel of the Alberti, in S. Croce, beside a door in the scene wherein,\r\nthe Emperor Heraclius is bearing the Cross; it is painted in profile,\r\nwith a little beard, and with a rose-coloured cap on his head according\r\nto the use of those times. He was not excellent in draughtsmanship, in\r\nso far as is shown by some drawings by his hand that are in our book.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: A yellow-lake made from the unripe berries
