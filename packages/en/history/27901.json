Each one is a dear and precious possession to me. As I once\r\nmore pass them in review, reminiscences fill my mind of solemn occasions\r\nand impressive scenes, of excellent men and charming women. I feel as\r\nthough I were sending the best beloved children of my fancy out into the\r\nworld, and sadness seizes me when I realize that they no longer belong\r\nto me alone--that they have become the property of strangers. The living\r\nword falling upon the ear of the listener is one thing; quite another\r\nthe word staring from the cold, printed page. Will my thoughts be\r\naccorded the same friendly welcome that greeted them when first they\r\nwere uttered?\r\n\r\nI venture to hope that they may be kindly received; for these addresses\r\nwere born of devoted love to Judaism. The consciousness that Israel is\r\ncharged with a great historical mission, not yet accomplished, ushered\r\nthem into existence. Truth and sincerity stood sponsor to every word. Is\r\nit presumptuous, then, to hope that they may find favor in the New\r\nWorld? Brethren of my faith live there as here; our ancient watchword,\r\n\"Sh'ma Yisrael,\" resounds in their synagogues as in ours; the old\r\nblood-stained flag, with its sublime inscription, \"The Lord is my\r\nbanner!\" floats over them; and Jewish hearts in America are loyal like\r\nours, and sustained by steadfast faith in the Messianic time when our\r\nhopes and ideals, our aims and dreams, will be realized. There is but\r\none Judaism the world over, by the Jordan and the Tagus as by the\r\nVistula and the Mississippi. God bless and protect it, and lead it to\r\nthe goal of its glorious future!\r\n\r\nTo all Jewish hearts beyond the ocean, in free America, fraternal\r\ngreetings!\r\n\r\nGUSTAV KARPELES\r\n\r\nBERLIN, Pesach 5652/1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nA GLANCE AT JEWISH LITERATURE\r\n\r\nTHE TALMUD\r\n\r\nTHE JEW IN THE HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\nWOMEN IN JEWISH LITERATURE\r\n\r\nMOSES MAIMONIDES\r\n\r\nJEWISH TROUBADOURS AND MINNESINGERS\r\n\r\nHUMOR AND LOVE IN JEWISH POETRY\r\n\r\nTHE JEWISH STAGE\r\n\r\nTHE JEW'S QUEST IN AFRICA\r\n\r\nA JEWISH KING IN POLAND\r\n\r\nJEWISH SOCIETY IN THE TIME OF MENDELSSOHN\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD ZUNZ\r\n\r\nHEINRICH HEINE AND JUDAISM\r\n\r\nTHE MUSIC OF THE SYNAGOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GLANCE AT JEWISH LITERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a well-known passage of the _Romanzero_, rebuking Jewish women for\r\ntheir ignorance of the magnificent golden age of their nation's poetry,\r\nHeine used unmeasured terms of condemnation. He was too severe, for the\r\nsources from which he drew his own information were of a purely\r\nscientific character, necessarily unintelligible to the ordinary reader.\r\nThe first truly popular presentation of the whole of Jewish literature\r\nwas made only a few years ago, and could not have existed in Heine's\r\ntime, as the most valuable treasures of that literature, a veritable\r\nHebrew Pompeii, have been unearthed from the mould and rubbish of the\r\nlibraries within this century. Investigations of the history of Jewish\r\nliterature have been possible, then, only during the last fifty years.\r\n\r\nBut in the course of this half-century, conscientious research has so\r\nactively been prosecuted that we can now gain at least a bird's-eye view\r\nof the whole course of our literature. Some stretches still lie in\r\nshadow, and it is not astonishing that eminent scholars continue to\r\nmaintain that \"there is no such thing as an organic history, a logical\r\ndevelopment, of the gigantic neo-Hebraic literature\"; while such as are\r\nacquainted with the results of late research at best concede that\r\nHebrew literature has been permitted to garner a \"tender aftermath.\"\r\nBoth verdicts are untrue and unfair. Jewish literature has developed\r\norganically, and in the course of its evolution it has had its\r\nspring-tide as well as its season of decay, this again followed by\r\nvigorous rejuvenescence.\r\n\r\nSuch opinions are part and parcel of the vicissitudes of our literature,\r\nin themselves sufficient matter for an interesting book. Strange it\r\ncertainly is that a people without a home, without a land, living under\r\nrepression and persecution, could produce so great a literature;\r\nstranger still, that it should at first have been preserved and\r\ndisseminated, then forgotten, or treated with the disdain of prejudice,\r\nand finally roused from torpid slumber into robust life by the breath of\r\nthe modern era. In the neighborhood of twenty-two thousand works are\r\nknown to us now. Fifty years ago bibliographers were ignorant of the\r\nexistence of half of these, and in the libraries of Italy, England, and\r\nGermany an untold number awaits resurrection.\r\n\r\nIn fact, our literature has not yet been given a name that recommends\r\nitself to universal acceptance. Some have called it \"Rabbinical\r\nLiterature,\" because during the middle ages every Jew of learning bore\r\nthe title Rabbi; others, \"Neo-Hebraic\"; and a third party considers it\r\npurely theological. These names are all inadequate. Perhaps the only one\r\nsufficiently comprehensive is \"Jewish Literature.\" That embraces, as it\r\nshould, the aggregate of writings produced by Jews from the earliest\r\ndays of their history up to the present time, regardless of form, of\r\nlanguage, and, in the middle ages at least, of subject-matter.\r\n\r\nWith this definition in mind, we are able to sketch the whole course of\r\nour literature, though in the frame of an essay only in outline. We\r\nshall learn, as Leopold Zunz, the Humboldt of Jewish science, well says,\r\nthat it is \"intimately bound up with the culture of the ancient world,\r\nwith the origin and development of Christianity, and with the scientific\r\nendeavors of the middle ages. Inasmuch as it shares the intellectual\r\naspirations of the past and the present, their conflicts and their\r\nreverses, it is supplementary to general literature. Its peculiar\r\nfeatures, themselves falling under universal laws, are in turn helpful\r\nin the interpretation of general characteristics. If the aggregate\r\nresults of mankind's intellectual activity can be likened unto a sea,\r\nJewish literature is one of the tributaries that feed it. Like other\r\nliteratures and like literature in general, it reveals to the student\r\nwhat noble ideals the soul of man has cherished, and striven to realize,\r\nand discloses the varied achievements of man's intellectual powers. If\r\nwe of to-day are the witnesses and the offspring of an eternal, creative\r\nprinciple, then, in turn, the present is but the beginning of a future,\r\nthat is, the translation of knowledge into life. Spiritual ideals\r\nconsciously held by any portion of mankind lend freedom to thought,\r\ngrace to feeling, and by sailing up this one stream we may reach the\r\nfountain-head whence have emanated all spiritual forces, and about\r\nwhich, as a fixed pole, all spiritual currents eddy.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe cornerstone of this Jewish literature is the Bible, or what we call\r\nOld Testament literature--the oldest and at the same time the most\r\nimportant of Jewish writings. It extends over the period ending with the\r\nsecond century before the common era; is written, for the most part, in\r\nHebrew, and is the clearest and the most faithful reflection of the\r\noriginal characteristics of the Jewish people. This biblical literature\r\nhas engaged the closest attention of all nations and every age. Until\r\nthe seventeenth century, biblical science was purely dogmatic, and only\r\nsince Herder pointed the way have its aesthetic elements been dwelt upon\r\nalong with, often in defiance of, dogmatic considerations. Up to this\r\ntime, Ernest Meier and Theodor Noeldeke have been the only ones to treat\r\nof the Old Testament with reference to its place in the history of\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nDespite the dogmatic air clinging to the critical introductions to the\r\nstudy of the Old Testament, their authors have not shrunk from treating\r\nthe book sacred to two religions with childish arbitrariness. Since the\r\ndays of Spinoza's essay at rationalistic explanation, Bible criticism\r\nhas been the wrestling-ground of the most extravagant exegesis, of bold\r\nhypotheses, and hazardous conjectures. No Latin or Greek classic has\r\nbeen so ruthlessly attacked and dissected; no mediaeval poetry so\r\narbitrarily interpreted. As a natural consequence, the aesthetic\r\nelements were more and more pushed into the background. Only recently\r\nhave we begun to ridicule this craze for hypotheses, and returned to\r\nmore sober methods of inquiry. Bible criticism reached the climax of\r\nabsurdity, and the scorn was just which greeted one of the most\r\nimportant works of the critical school, Hitzig's \"Explanation of the\r\nPsalms.\" A reviewer said: \"We may entertain the fond hope that, in a\r\nsecond edition of this clever writer's commentary, he will be in the\r\nenviable position to tell us the day and the hour when each psalm was\r\ncomposed.\"\r\n\r\nThe reaction began a few years ago with the recognition of the\r\ninadequacy of Astruc's document hypothesis, until then the creed of all\r\nBible critics. Astruc, a celebrated French physician, in 1753 advanced\r\nthe theory that the Pentateuch--the five books of Moses--consists of two\r\nparallel documents, called respectively Yahvistic and Elohistic, from\r\nthe name applied to God in each. On this basis, German science after him\r\nraised a superstructure. No date was deemed too late to be assigned to\r\nthe composition of the Pentateuch. If the historian Flavius Josephus had\r\nnot existed, and if Jesus had not spoken of \"the Law\" and \"the\r\nprophets,\" and of the things \"which were written in the Law of Moses,\r\nand in the Prophets, and in the Psalms,\" critics would have been\r\ndisposed to transfer the redaction of the Bible to some period of the\r\nChristian era. So wide is the divergence of opinions on the subject\r\nthat two learned critics, Ewald and Hitzig, differ in the date assigned\r\nto a certain biblical passage by no less than a thousand years!\r\n\r\nBible archaeology, Bible exegesis, and discussions of grammatical\r\nniceties, were confounded with the history of biblical literature, and\r\nnaturally it was the latter that suffered by the lack of\r\ndifferentiation. Orthodoxy assumed a purely divine origin for the Bible,\r\nwhile sceptics treated the holy book with greater levity than they would\r\ndare display in criticising a modern novel. The one party raised a hue\r\nand cry when Moses was spoken of as the first author; the other\r\ndiscovered \"obscene, rude, even cannibalistic traits\"[2] in the sublime\r\nnarratives of the Bible. It should be the task of coming generations,\r\nsuccessors by one remove of credulous Bible lovers, and immediate heirs\r\nof thorough-going rationalists, to reconcile and fuse in a higher\r\nconception of the Bible the two divergent theories of its purely divine\r\nand its purely human origin. Unfortunately, it must be admitted that\r\nErnest Meier is right, when he says, in his \"History of the National\r\nPoetry of the Hebrews,\" that this task wholly belongs to the future; at\r\npresent it is an unsolved problem.\r\n\r\nThe aesthetic is the only proper point of view for a full recognition of\r\nthe value of biblical literature. It certainly does not rob the sacred\r\nScriptures, the perennial source of spiritual comfort, of their exalted\r\ncharacter and divine worth to assume that legend, myth, and history\r\nhave combined to produce the perfect harmony which is their imperishable\r\ndistinction. The peasant dwelling on inaccessible mountain-heights, next\r\nto the record of Abraham's shepherd life, inscribes the main events of\r\nhis own career, the anniversary dates sacred to his family. The young\r\ncount among their first impressions that of \"the brown folio,\" and more\r\nvividly than all else remember\r\n\r\n    \"The maidens fair and true,\r\n      The sages and the heroes bold,\r\n    Whose tale by seers inspired\r\n      In our Book of books is told.\r\n\r\n    The simple life and faith\r\n      Of patriarchs of ancient day\r\n    Like angels hover near,\r\n      And guard, and lead them on the way.\"[3]\r\n\r\nAbove all, a whole nation has for centuries been living with, and only\r\nby virtue of, this book. Surely this is abundant testimony to the\r\nundying value of the great work, in which the simplest shepherd tales\r\nand the naivest legends, profound moral saws and magnificent images, the\r\nideals of a Messianic future and the purest, the most humane conception\r\nof life, alternate with sublime descriptions of nature and the sweet\r\nstrains of love-poems, with national songs breathing hope, or trembling\r\nwith anguish, and with the dull tones of despairing pessimism and the\r\ndivinely inspired hymns of an exalted theodicy--all blending to form\r\nwhat the reverential love of men has named the Book of books.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that a book of this kind should become the basis of a\r\ngreat literature. Whatever was produced in later times had to submit to\r\nbe judged by its exalted standard. It became the rule of conduct, the\r\nprophetic mirror reflecting the future work of a nation whose fate was\r\ninextricably bound up with its own. It is not known how and when the\r\nbiblical scriptures were welded into one book, a holy canon, but it is\r\nprobably correct to assume that it was done by the _Soferim_, the\r\nScribes, between 200 and 150 B.C.E. At all events, it is certain that\r\nthe three divisions of the Bible--the Pentateuch, the Prophets, and the\r\nmiscellaneous writings--were contained in the Greek version, the\r\nSeptuagint, so called from the seventy or seventy-two Alexandrians\r\nsupposed to have done the work of translation under Ptolemy\r\nPhiladelphus.\r\n\r\nThe Greek translation of the Bible marks the beginning of the second\r\nperiod of Jewish literature, the Judaeo-Hellenic. Hebrew ceased to be the\r\nlanguage of the people; it was thenceforth used only by scholars and in\r\ndivine worship. Jewish for the first time met Greek intellect. Shem and\r\nJapheth embraced fraternally. \"But even while the teachings of Hellas\r\nwere pushing their way into subjugated Palestine, seducing Jewish\r\nphilosophy to apostasy, and seeking, by main force, to introduce\r\npaganism, the Greek philosophers themselves stood awed by the majesty\r\nand power of the Jewish prophets. Swords and words entered the lists as\r\nchampions of Judaism. The vernacular Aramaean, having suffered the Greek\r\nto put its impress upon many of its substantives, refused to yield to\r\nthe influence of the Greek verb, and, in the end, Hebrew truth, in the\r\nguise of the teachings of Jesus, undermined the proud structure of the\r\nheathen.\" This is a most excellent characterization of that literary\r\nperiod, which lasted about three centuries, ending between 100 and 150\r\nC. E. Its influence upon Jewish literature can scarcely be said to have\r\nbeen enduring. To it belong all the apocryphal writings which,\r\noriginally composed in the Greek language, were for that reason not\r\nincorporated into the Holy Canon. The centre of intellectual life was no\r\nlonger in Palestine, but at Alexandria in Egypt, where three hundred\r\nthousand Jews were then living, and thus this literature came to be\r\ncalled Judaeo-Alexandrian. It includes among its writers the last of the\r\nNeoplatonists, particularly Philo, the originator of the allegorical\r\ninterpretation of the Bible and of a Jewish philosophy of religion;\r\nAristeas, and pseudo-Phokylides. There were also Jewish _litterateurs_:\r\nthe dramatist Ezekielos; Jason; Philo the Elder; Aristobulus, the\r\npopularizer of the Aristotelian philosophy; Eupolemos, the historian;\r\nand probably the Jewish Sybil, who had to have recourse to the oracular\r\nmanner of the pagans to proclaim the truths of Judaism, and to Greek\r\nfigures of speech for her apocalyptic visions, which foretold, in\r\nbiblical phrase and with prophetic ardor, the future of Israel and of\r\nthe nations in contact with it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the word of the Bible was steadily gaining importance in\r\nPalestine. To search into and expound the sacred text had become the\r\ninheritance of the congregation of Jacob, of those that had not lent ear\r\nto the siren notes of Hellenism. Midrash, as the investigations of the\r\ncommentators were called, by and by divided into two streams--Halacha,\r\nwhich establishes and systematizes the statutes of the Law, and Haggada,\r\nwhich uses the sacred texts for homiletic, historical, ethical, and\r\npedagogic discussions. The latter is the poetic, the former, the\r\nlegislative, element in the Talmudic writings, whose composition,\r\nextending over a thousand years, constitutes the third, the most\r\nmomentous, period of Jewish literature. Of course, none of these periods\r\ncan be so sharply defined as a rapid survey might lead one to suppose.\r\nFor instance, on the threshold of this third epoch stands the figure of\r\nFlavius Josephus, the famous Jewish historian, who, at once an\r\nenthusiastic Jew and a friend of the Romans, writes the story of his\r\nnation in the Greek language--a character as peculiar as his age, which,\r\nlistening to the mocking laughter of a Lucian, saw Olympus overthrown\r\nand its gods dethroned, the Temple at Jerusalem pass away in flame and\r\nsmoke, and the new doctrine of the son of the carpenter at Nazareth\r\nbegin its victorious course.\r\n\r\nBy the side of this Janus-faced historian, the heroes of the Talmud\r\nstand enveloped in glory. We meet with men like Hillel and Shammai,\r\nJochanan ben Zakkai, Gamaliel, Joshua ben Chananya, the famous Akiba,\r\nand later on Yehuda the Prince, friend of the imperial philosopher\r\nMarcus Aurelius, and compiler of the Mishna, the authoritative code of\r\nlaws superseding all other collections. Then there are the fabulist\r\nMeir; Simon ben Yochai, falsely accused of the authorship of the\r\nmystical Kabbala; Chiya; Rab; Samuel, equally famous as a physician and\r\na rabbi; Jochanan, the supposed compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud; and\r\nAshi and Abina, the former probably the arranger of the Babylonian\r\nTalmud. This latter Talmud, the one invested with authority among Jews,\r\nby reason of its varying fortunes, is the most marvellous literary\r\nmonument extant. Never has book been so hated and so persecuted, so\r\nmisjudged and so despised, on the other hand, so prized and so honored,\r\nand, above all, so imperfectly understood, as this very Talmud.\r\n\r\nFor the Jews and their literature it has had untold significance. That\r\nthe Talmud has been the conservator of Judaism is an irrefutable\r\nstatement. It is true that the study of the Talmud unduly absorbed the\r\ngreat intellectual force of its adherents, and brought about a somewhat\r\none-sided mental development in the Jews; but it also is true, as a\r\nwriter says,[4] that \"whenever in troublous times scientific inquiry was\r\nlaid low; whenever, for any reason, the Jew was excluded from\r\nparticipation in public life, the study of the Talmud maintained the\r\nelasticity and the vigor of the Jewish mind, and rescued the Jew from\r\nsterile mysticism and spiritual apathy. The Talmud, as a rule, has been\r\ninimical to mysticism, and the most brilliant Talmudists, in propitious\r\ndays, have achieved distinguished success in secular science. The Jew\r\nsurvived ages of bitterness, all the while clinging loyally to his faith\r\nin the midst of hostility, and the first ray of light that penetrated\r\nthe walls of the Ghetto found him ready to take part in the intellectual\r\nwork of his time. This admirable elasticity of mind he owes, first and\r\nforemost, to the study of the Talmud.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this much abused Talmud, as from its contemporary the Midrash in\r\nthe restricted sense, sprouted forth the blossoms of the Haggada--that\r\nHaggada\r\n\r\n    \"Where the beauteous, ancient sagas,\r\n    Angel legends fraught with meaning,\r\n    Martyrs' silent sacrifices,\r\n    Festal songs and wisdom's sayings,\r\n\r\n    Trope and allegoric fancies--\r\n    All, howe'er by faith's triumphant\r\n    Glow pervaded--where they gleaming,\r\n    Glist'ning, well in strength exhaustless.\r\n\r\n    And the boyish heart responsive\r\n    Drinks the wild, fantastic sweetness,\r\n    Greets the woful, wondrous anguish,\r\n    Yields to grewsome charm of myst'ry,\r\n\r\n    Hid in blessed worlds of fable.\r\n    Overawed it hearkens solemn\r\n    To that sacred revelation\r\n    Mortal man hath poetry called.\"[5]\r\n\r\nA story from the Midrash charmingly characterizes the relation between\r\nHalacha and Haggada. Two rabbis, Chiya bar Abba, a Halachist, and\r\nAbbahu, a Haggadist, happened to be lecturing in the same town. Abbahu,\r\nthe Haggadist, was always listened to by great crowds, while Chiya, with\r\nhis Halacha, stood practically deserted. The Haggadist comforted the\r\ndisappointed teacher with a parable. \"Let us suppose two merchants,\" he\r\nsaid, \"to come to town, and offer wares for sale. The one has pearls and\r\nprecious gems to display, the other, cheap finery, gilt chains, rings,\r\nand gaudy ribbons. About whose booth, think you, does the crowd\r\npress?--Formerly, when the struggle for existence was not fierce and\r\ninevitable, men had leisure and desire for the profound teachings of the\r\nLaw; now they need the cheering words of consolation and hope.\"\r\n\r\nFor more than a thousand years this nameless spirit of national poesy\r\nwas abroad, and produced manifold works, which, in the course of time,\r\nwere gathered together into comprehensive collections, variously named\r\nMidrash Rabba, Pesikta, Tanchuma, etc. Their compilation was begun in\r\nabout 700 C. E., that is, soon after the close of the Talmud, in the\r\ntransition period from the third epoch of Jewish literature to the\r\nfourth, the golden age, which lasted from the ninth to the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and, according to the law of human products, shows a season of\r\ngrowth, blossom, and decay.\r\n\r\nThe scene of action during this period was western Asia, northern\r\nAfrica, sometimes Italy and France, but chiefly Spain, where Arabic\r\nculture, destined to influence Jewish thought to an incalculable degree,\r\nwas at that time at its zenith. \"A second time the Jews were drawn into\r\nthe vortex of a foreign civilization, and two hundred years after\r\nMohammed, Jews in Kairwan and Bagdad were speaking the same language,\r\nArabic. A language once again became the mediatrix between Jewish and\r\ngeneral literature, and the best minds of the two races, by means of the\r\nlanguage, reciprocally influenced each other. Jews, as they once had\r\nwritten Greek for their brethren, now wrote Arabic; and, as in\r\nHellenistic times, the civilization of the dominant race, both in its\r\noriginal features and in its adaptations from foreign sources, was\r\nreflected in that of the Jews.\" It would be interesting to analyze this\r\nimportant process of assimilation, but we can concern ourselves only\r\nwith the works of the Jewish intellect. Again we meet, at the threshold\r\nof the period, a characteristic figure, the thinker Sa'adia, ranking\r\nhigh as author and religious philosopher, known also as a grammarian and\r\na poet. He is followed by Sherira, to whom we owe the beginnings of a\r\nhistory of Talmudic literature, and his son Hai Gaon, a strictly\r\northodox teacher of the Law. In their wake come troops of physicians,\r\ntheologians, lexicographers, Talmudists, and grammarians. Great is the\r\ncircle of our national literature: it embraces theology, philosophy,\r\nexegesis, grammar, poetry, and jurisprudence, yea, even astronomy and\r\nchronology, mathematics and medicine. But these widely varying subjects\r\nconstitute only one class, inasmuch as they all are infused with the\r\nspirit of Judaism, and subordinate themselves to its demands. A mention\r\nof the prominent actors would turn this whole essay into a dry list of\r\nnames. Therefore it is better for us merely to sketch the period in\r\noutline, dwelling only on its greatest poets and philosophers, the\r\nmoulders of its character.\r\n\r\nThe opinion is current that the Semitic race lacks the philosophic\r\nfaculty. Yet it cannot be denied that Jews were the first to carry Greek\r\nphilosophy to Europe, teaching and developing it there before its\r\ndissemination by celebrated Arabs. In their zeal to harmonize philosophy\r\nwith their religion, and in the lesser endeavor to defend traditional\r\nJudaism against the polemic attacks of a new sect, the Karaites, they\r\ninvested the Aristotelian system with peculiar features, making it, as\r\nit were, their national philosophy. At all events, it must be\r\nuniversally accepted that the Jews share with the Arabs the merit \"of\r\nhaving cherished the study of philosophy during centuries of barbarism,\r\nand of having for a long time exerted a civilizing influence upon\r\nEurope.\"\r\n\r\nThe meagre achievements of the Jews in the departments of history and\r\nhistory of literature do not justify the conclusion that they are\r\nwanting in historic perception. The lack of writings on these subjects\r\nis traceable to the sufferings and persecutions that have marked their\r\npathway. Before their chroniclers had time to record past afflictions,\r\nnew sorrows and troubles broke in upon them. In the middle ages, the\r\nhistory of Jewish literature is the entire history of the Jewish people,\r\nits course outlined by blood and watered by rivers of tears, at whose\r\nsource the genius of Jewish poetry sits lamenting. \"The Orient dwells an\r\nexile in the Occident,\" Franz Delitzsch, the first alien to give loving\r\nstudy to this literature, poetically says, \"and its tears of longing for\r\nhome are the fountain-head of Jewish poetry.\"[6]\r\n\r\nThat poetry reached its perfection in the works of the celebrated trio,\r\nSolomon Gabirol, Yehuda Halevi, and Moses ben Ezra. Their dazzling\r\ntriumphs had been heralded by the more modest achievements of Abitur,\r\nwriting Hebrew, and Adia and the poetess Xemona (Kasmune) using Arabic,\r\nto sing the praise of God and lament the woes of Israel.\r\n\r\nThe predominant, but not exclusive, characteristic of Jewish poetry is\r\nits religious strain. Great thinkers, men equipped with philosophic\r\ntraining, and at the same time endowed with poetic gifts, have\r\ncontributed to the huge volume of synagogue poetry, whose subjects are\r\npraise of the Lord and regret for Zion. The sorrow for our lost\r\nfatherland has never taken on more glowing colors, never been expressed\r\nin fuller tones than in this poetry. As ancient Hebrew poetry flowed in\r\nthe two streams of prophecy and psalmody, so the Jewish poetry of the\r\nmiddle ages was divided into _Piut_ and _Selicha_. Songs of hope and\r\ndespair, cries of revenge, exhortations to peace among men, elegies on\r\nevery single persecution, and laments for Zion, follow each other in\r\nkaleidoscopic succession. Unfortunately, there never was lack of\r\nhistoric matter for this poetry to elaborate. To furnish that was the\r\nwell-accomplished task of rulers and priests in the middle ages, alike\r\n\"in the realm of the Islamic king of kings and in that of the apostolic\r\nservant of servants.\" So fate made this poetry classical and eminently\r\nnational. Those characteristics which, in general literature, earn for a\r\nwork the description \"Homeric,\" in Jewish literature make a liturgical\r\npoem \"Kaliric,\" so called from the poet Eliezer Kalir, the subject of\r\nmany mythical tales, and the first of a long line of poets, Spanish,\r\nFrench, and German, extending to the sixteenth or seventeenth century.\r\nThe literary history of this epoch has been written by Leopold Zunz with\r\nwarmth of feeling and stupendous learning. He closes his work with the\r\nhope that mankind, at some future day, will adopt Israel's religious\r\npoetry as its own, transforming the elegiac _Selicha_ into a joyous\r\npsalm of universal peace and good-will.\r\n\r\nSide by side with religious flourishes secular poetry, clothing itself\r\nin rhyme and metre, adopting every current form of poesy, and treating\r\nof every appropriate subject. Its first votary was Solomon Gabirol, that\r\n\r\n    \"Human nightingale that warbled\r\n    Forth her songs of tender love,\r\n    In the darkness of the sombre,\r\n    Gothic mediaeval night.\r\n\r\n    She, that nightingale, sang only,\r\n    Sobbing forth her adoration,\r\n    To her Lord, her God, in heaven,\r\n    Whom her songs of praise extolled.\"[7]\r\n\r\nSolomon Gabirol may be said to have been the first poet thrilled by\r\n_Weltschmerz_. \"He produced hymns and songs, penitential prayers,\r\npsalms, and threnodies, filled with hope and longing for a blessed\r\nfuture. They are marked throughout by austere earnestness, brushing\r\naway, in its rigor, the color and bloom of life; but side by side with\r\nit, surging forth from the deepest recesses of a human soul, is humble\r\nadoration of God.\"\r\n\r\nGabirol was a distinguished philosopher besides. In 1150, his chief\r\nwork, \"The Fount of Life,\" was translated into Latin by Archdeacon\r\nDominicus Gundisalvi, with the help of Johannes Avendeath, an apostate\r\nJew, the author's name being corrupted into Avencebrol, later becoming\r\nAvicebron. The work was made a text-book of scholastic philosophy, but\r\nneither Scotists nor Thomists, neither adherents nor detractors,\r\nsuspected that a heretical Jew was slumbering under the name Avicebron.\r\nIt remained for an inquirer of our own day, Solomon Munk, to reveal the\r\nface of Gabirol under the mask of a garbled name. Amazed, we behold that\r\nthe pessimistic philosopher of to-day can as little as the schoolmen of\r\nthe middle ages shake himself free from the despised Jew. Schopenhauer\r\nmay object as he will, it is certain that Gabirol was his predecessor by\r\nmore than eight hundred years!\r\n\r\nCharisi, whom we shall presently meet, has expressed the verdict on his\r\npoetry which still holds good: \"Solomon Gabirol pleases to call himself\r\nthe small--yet before him all the great must dwindle and fall.--Who can\r\nlike him with mighty speech appall?--Compared with him the poets of his\r\ntime are without power--he, the small, alone is a tower.--The highest\r\nround of poetry's ladder has he won.--Wisdom fondled him, eloquence hath\r\ncalled him son--and clothing him with purple, said: 'Lo!--my first-born\r\nson, go forth, to conquest go!'--His predecessors' songs are naught with\r\nhis compared--nor have his many followers better fared.--The later\r\nsingers by him were taught--the heirs they are of his poetic\r\nthought.--But still he's king, to him all praise belongs--for Solomon's\r\nis the Song of Songs.\"\r\n\r\nBy Gabirol's side stands Yehuda Halevi, probably the only Jewish poet\r\nknown to the reader of general literature, to whom his name, life, and\r\nfate have become familiar through Heinrich Heine's _Romanzero_. His\r\nmagnificent descriptions of nature \"reflect southern skies, verdant\r\nmeadows, deep blue rivers, and the stormy sea,\" and his erotic lyrics\r\nare chaste and tender. He sounds the praise of wine, youth, and\r\nhappiness, and extols the charms of his lady-love, but above and beyond\r\nall he devotes his song to Zion and his people. The pearl of his poems\r\n\r\n    \"Is the famous lamentation\r\n    Sung in all the tents of Jacob,\r\n    Scattered wide upon the earth ...\r\n\r\n    Yea, it is the song of Zion,\r\n    Which Yehuda ben Halevy,\r\n    Dying on the holy ruins,\r\n    Sang of loved Jerusalem.\"[8]\r\n\r\n\"In the whole compass of religious poetry, Milton's and Klopstock's not\r\nexcepted, nothing can be found to surpass the elegy of Zion,\" says a\r\nmodern writer, a non-Jew.[9] This soul-stirring \"Lay of Zion,\" better\r\nthan any number of critical dissertations, will give the reader a clear\r\ninsight into the character and spirit of Jewish poetry in general:\r\n\r\n    O Zion! of thine exiles' peace take thought,\r\n    The remnant of thy flock, who thine have sought!\r\n    From west, from east, from north and south resounds,\r\n    Afar and now anear, from all thy bounds,\r\n              And no surcease,\r\n              \"With thee be peace!\"\r\n\r\n    In longing's fetters chained I greet thee, too,\r\n    My tears fast welling forth like Hermon's dew--\r\n    O bliss could they but drop on holy hills!\r\n    A croaking bird I turn, when through me thrills\r\n    Thy desolate state; but when I dream anon,\r\n    The Lord brings back thy ev'ry captive son--\r\n              A harp straightway\r\n              To sing thy lay.\r\n\r\n    In heart I dwell where once thy purest son\r\n    At Bethel and Peniel, triumphs won;\r\n    God's awesome presence there was close to thee,\r\n    Whose doors thy Maker, by divine decree,\r\n          Opposed as mates\r\n          To heaven's gates.\r\n\r\n    Nor sun, nor moon, nor stars had need to be;\r\n    God's countenance alone illumined thee\r\n    On whose elect He poured his spirit out.\r\n    In thee would I my soul pour forth devout!\r\n    Thou wert the kingdom's seat, of God the throne,\r\n    And now there dwells a slave race, not thine own,\r\n          In royal state,\r\n          Where reigned thy great.\r\n\r\n    O would that I could roam o'er ev'ry place\r\n    Where God to missioned prophets showed His grace!\r\n    And who will give me wings? An off'ring meet,\r\n    I'd haste to lay upon thy shattered seat,\r\n          Thy counterpart--\r\n          My bruised heart.\r\n\r\n    Upon thy precious ground I'd fall prostrate,\r\n    Thy stones caress, the dust within thy gate,\r\n    And happiness it were in awe to stand\r\n    At Hebron's graves, the treasures of thy land,\r\n    And greet thy woods, thy vine-clad slopes, thy vales,\r\n    Greet Abarim and Hor, whose light ne'er pales,\r\n          A radiant crown,\r\n          Thy priests' renown.\r\n\r\n    Thy air is balm for souls; like myrrh thy sand;\r\n    With honey run the rivers of thy land.\r\n    Though bare my feet, my heart's delight I'd count\r\n    To thread my way all o'er thy desert mount,\r\n          Where once rose tall\r\n          Thy holy hall,\r\n\r\n    Where stood thy treasure-ark, in recess dim,\r\n    Close-curtained, guarded o'er by cherubim.\r\n    My Naz'rite's crown would I pluck off, and cast\r\n    It gladly forth. With curses would I blast\r\n    The impious time thy people, diadem-crowned,\r\n    Thy Nazirites, did pass, by en'mies bound\r\n          With hatred's bands,\r\n          In unclean lands.\r\n\r\n    By dogs thy lusty lions are brutal torn\r\n    And dragged; thy strong, young eaglets, heav'nward\r\n    borne,\r\n    By foul-mouthed ravens snatched, and all undone.\r\n    Can food still tempt my taste? Can light of sun\r\n          Seem fair to shine\r\n          To eyes like mine?\r\n\r\n    Soft, soft! Leave off a while, O cup of pain!\r\n    My loins are weighted down, my heart and brain,\r\n    With bitterness from thee. Whene'er I think\r\n    Of Oholah,[10] proud northern queen, I drink\r\n    Thy wrath, and when my Oholivah forlorn\r\n    Comes back to mind--'tis then I quaff thy scorn,\r\n          Then, draught of pain,\r\n          Thy lees I drain.\r\n\r\n    O Zion! Crown of grace! Thy comeliness\r\n    Hath ever favor won and fond caress.\r\n    Thy faithful lovers' lives are bound in thine;\r\n    They joy in thy security, but pine\r\n          And weep in gloom\r\n          O'er thy sad doom.\r\n\r\n    From out the prisoner's cell they sigh for thee,\r\n    And each in prayer, wherever he may be,\r\n    Towards thy demolished portals turns. Exiled,\r\n    Dispersed from mount to hill, thy flock defiled\r\n    Hath not forgot thy sheltering fold. They grasp\r\n    Thy garment's hem, and trustful, eager, clasp,\r\n              With outstretched arms,\r\n              Thy branching palms.\r\n\r\n    Shinar, Pathros--can they in majesty\r\n    With thee compare? Or their idolatry\r\n    With thy Urim and thy Thummim august?\r\n    Who can surpass thy priests, thy saintly just,\r\n              Thy prophets bold,\r\n              And bards of old?\r\n\r\n    The heathen kingdoms change and wholly cease--\r\n    Thy might alone stands firm without decrease,\r\n    Thy Nazirites from age to age abide,\r\n    Thy God in thee desireth to reside.\r\n    Then happy he who maketh choice of thee\r\n    To dwell within thy courts, and waits to see,\r\n              And toils to make,\r\n              Thy light awake.\r\n\r\n    On him shall as the morning break thy light,\r\n    The bliss of thy elect shall glad his sight,\r\n    In thy felicities shall he rejoice,\r\n    In triumph sweet exult, with jubilant voice,\r\n              O'er thee, adored,\r\n              To youth restored.\r\n\r\nWe have loitered long with Yehuda Halevi, and still not long enough, for\r\nwe have not yet spoken of his claims to the title philosopher, won for\r\nhim by his book _Al-Chazari_. But now we must hurry on to Moses ben\r\nEzra, the last and most worldly of the three great poets. He devotes his\r\ngenius to his patrons, to wine, his faithless mistress, and to\r\n\"bacchanalian feasts under leafy canopies, with merry minstrelsy of\r\nbirds.\" He laments over separation from friends and kin, weeps over the\r\nshortness of life and the rapid approach of hoary age--all in polished\r\nlanguage, sometimes, however, lacking euphony. Even when he strikes his\r\nlyre in praise and honor of his people Israel, he fails to rise to the\r\nlofty heights attained by his mates in song.\r\n\r\nWith Yehuda Charisi, at the beginning of the thirteenth century, the\r\nperiod of the epigones sets in for Spanish-Jewish literature. In\r\nCharisi's _Tachkemoni_, an imitation of the poetry of the Arab Hariri,\r\njest and serious criticism, joy and grief, the sublime and the trivial,\r\nfollow each other like tints in a parti-colored skein. His distinction\r\nis the ease with which he plays upon the Hebrew language, not the most\r\npliable of instruments. In general, Jewish poets and philosophers have\r\nmanipulated that language with surprising dexterity. Songs, hymns,\r\nelegies, penitential prayers, exhortations, and religious meditations,\r\ngeneration after generation, were couched in the idiom of the psalmist,\r\nyet the structure of the language underwent no change. \"The development\r\nof the neo-Hebraic idiom from the ancient Hebrew,\" a distinguished\r\nmodern ethnographer justly says, \"confirms, by linguistic evidence, the\r\nplasticity, the logical acumen, the comprehensive and at the same time\r\nversatile intellectuality of the Jewish race. By the ingenious\r\ncompounding of words, by investing old expressions with new meanings,\r\nand adapting the material offered by alien or related languages to its\r\nown purposes, it has increased and enriched a comparatively meagre\r\ntreasury of words.\"[11]\r\n\r\nSide by side with this cosmopolitanism, illustrated in the Haggada,\r\nwhose pages prove that nothing human is strange to the Jewish race, it\r\nreveals, in its literary development, as notably in the Halacha, a\r\nsharply defined subjectivity. Jellinek says: \"Not losing itself in the\r\ncontemplation of the phenomena of life, not devoting itself to any\r\nsubject unless it be with an ulterior purpose, but seeing all things in\r\ntheir relation to itself, and subordinating them to its own boldly\r\nasserted _ego_, the Jewish race is not inclined to apply its powers to\r\nthe solution of intricate philosophic problems, or to abstruse\r\nmetaphysical speculations. It is, therefore, not a philosophic race, and\r\nits participation in the philosophic work of the world dates only from\r\nits contact with the Greeks.\" The same author, on the other hand,\r\nemphasizes the liberality, the broad sympathies, of the Jewish race, in\r\nhis statement that the Jewish mind, at its first meeting with Arabic\r\nphilosophy, absorbed it as a leaven into its intellectual life. The\r\nproduct of the assimilation was--as early as the twelfth century, mark\r\nyou--a philosophic conception of life, whose broad liberality culminates\r\nin the sentiment expressed by two most eminent thinkers: Christianity\r\nand Islam are the precursors of a world-religion, the preliminary\r\nconditions for the great religious system satisfying all men. Yehuda\r\nHalevi and Moses Maimonides were the philosophers bold enough to utter\r\nthis thought of far-reaching significance.\r\n\r\nThe second efflorescence of Jewish poetry brings forth exotic romances,\r\nsatires, verbose hymns, and humorous narrative poems. Such productions\r\ncertainly do not justify the application of the epithet \"theological\" to\r\nJewish literature. Solomon ben Sakbel composes a satiric romance in the\r\nMakamat[12] form, describing the varied adventures of Asher ben Yehuda,\r\nanother Don Quixote; Berachya Hanakdan puts into Hebrew the fables of\r\nAEsop and Lokman, furnishing La Fontaine with some of his material;\r\nAbraham ibn Sahl receives from the Arabs, certainly not noted for\r\nliberality, ten goldpieces for each of his love-songs; Santob de Carrion\r\nis a beloved Spanish bard, bold enough to tell unpleasant truths unto a\r\nking; Joseph ibn Sabara writes a humorous romance; Yehuda Sabbatai, epic\r\nsatires, \"The War of Wealth and Wisdom,\" and \"A Gift from a Misogynist,\"\r\nand unnamed authors, \"Truth's Campaign,\" and \"Praise of Women.\"\r\n\r\nA satirist of more than ordinary gifts was the Italian Kalonymos, whose\r\n\"Touchstone,\" like Ibn Chasdai's Makamat, \"The Prince and the Dervish,\"\r\nhas been translated into German. Contemporaneous with them was Suesskind\r\nvon Trimberg, the Suabian minnesinger, and Samson Pnie, of Strasburg,\r\nwho helped the German poets continue _Parzival_, while later on, in\r\nItaly, Moses Rieti composed \"The Paradise\" in Hebrew _terza-rima_.\r\n\r\nIn the decadence of Jewish literature, the most prominent figure is\r\nImmanuel ben Solomon, or Manoello, as the Italians call him. Critics\r\nthink him the precursor of Boccaccio, and history knows him as the\r\nfriend of Dante, whose _Divina Commedia_ he travestied in Hebrew. The\r\nauthor of the first Hebrew sonnet and of the first Hebrew novel, he was\r\na talented writer, but as frivolous as talented.\r\n\r\nThis is the development of Jewish poetry during its great period. In\r\nother departments of literature, in philosophy, in theology, in ethics,\r\nin Bible exegesis, the race is equally prolific in minds of the first\r\norder. Glancing back for a moment, our eye is arrested by Moses\r\nMaimonides, the great systematizer of the Jewish Law, and the connecting\r\nlink between scholasticism and the Greek-Arabic development of the\r\nAristotelian system. Before his time Bechai ibn Pakuda and Joseph ibn\r\nZadik had entered upon theosophic speculations with the object of\r\nharmonizing Arabic and Greek philosophy, and in the age immediately\r\npreceding that of Maimonides, Abraham ibn Daud, a writer of surprisingly\r\nliberal views, had undertaken, in \"The Highest Faith,\" the task of\r\nreconciling faith with philosophy. At the same time rationalistic Bible\r\nexegesis was begun by Abraham ibn Ezra, an acute but reckless\r\ncontroversialist. Orthodox interpretations of the Bible had, before him,\r\nbeen taught in France by Rashi (Solomon Yitschaki) and Samuel ben Meir,\r\nand continued by German rabbis, who, at the same time, were preachers of\r\nmorality--a noteworthy phenomenon in a persecuted tribe. \"How pure and\r\nstrong its ethical principles were is shown by its religious poetry as\r\nwell as by its practical Law. What pervades the poetry as a high ideal,\r\nin the application of the Law becomes demonstrable reality. The wrapt\r\nenthusiasm in the hymns of Samuel the Pious and other poets is embodied,\r\nlives, in the rulings of Yehuda Hakohen, Solomon Yitschaki, and Jacob\r\nben Meir; in the legal opinions of Isaac ben Abraham, Eliezer ha-Levi,\r\nIsaac ben Moses, Meir ben Baruch, and their successors, and in the\r\ncodices of Eliezer of Metz and Moses de Coucy. A German professor[13] of\r\na hundred years ago, after glancing through some few Jewish writings,\r\nexclaimed, in a tone of condescending approval: 'Christians of that time\r\ncould scarcely have been expected to enjoin such high moral principles\r\nas this Jew wrote down and bequeathed to his brethren in faith!'\"\r\n\r\nJewish literature in this and the next period consists largely of\r\ntheological discussions and of commentaries on the Talmud produced by\r\nthe hundred. It would be idle to name even the most prominent authors;\r\ntheir works belong to the history of theologic science, and rarely had a\r\ndetermining influence upon the development of genuine literature.\r\n\r\nWe must also pass over in silence the numerous Jewish physicians and\r\nmedical writers; but it must be remembered that they, too, belong to\r\nJewish literature. The most marvellous characteristic of this literature\r\nis that in it the Jewish race has registered each step of its\r\ndevelopment. \"All things learned, gathered, obtained, on its journeyings\r\nhither and thither--Greek philosophy and Arabic, as well as Latin\r\nscholasticism--all deposited themselves in layers about the Bible, so\r\nstamping later Jewish literature with an individuality that gave it an\r\nunique place among the literatures of the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe travellers, however, must be mentioned by name. Their itineraries\r\nwere wholly dedicated to the interests of their co-religionists. The\r\nfirst of the line is Eldad, the narrator of a sort of Hebrew Odyssey.\r\nBenjamin of Tudela and Petachya of Ratisbon are deserving of more\r\nconfidence as veracious chroniclers, and their descriptions, together\r\nwith Charisi's, complete the Jewish library of travels of those early\r\ndays, unless, with Steinschneider, we consider, as we truly may, the\r\nmajority of Jewish authors under this head. For Jewish writers a hard,\r\nnecessitous lot has ever been a storm wind, tossing them hither and\r\nthither, and blowing the seeds of knowledge over all lands. Withal\r\nlearning proved an enveloping, protecting cloak to these mendicant and\r\npilgrim authors. The dispersion of the Jews, their international\r\ncommerce, and the desire to maintain their academies, stimulated a love\r\nfor travel, made frequent journeyings a necessity, indeed. In this way\r\nonly can we account for the extraordinarily rapid spread of Jewish\r\nliterature in the middle ages. The student of those times often chances\r\nacross a rabbi, who this day teaches, lectures, writes in Candia,\r\nto-morrow in Rome, next year in Prague or Cracow, and so Jewish\r\nliterature is the \"wandering Jew\" among the world's literatures.\r\n\r\nThe fourth period, the Augustan age of our literature, closes with a\r\njarring discord--the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, their second\r\nhome, in which they had seen ministers, princes, professors, and poets\r\nrise from their ranks. The scene of literary activity changes: France,\r\nItaly, but chiefly the Slavonic East, are pushed into the foreground. It\r\nis not a salutary change; it ushers in three centuries of decay and\r\nstagnation in literary endeavor. The sum of the efforts is indicated by\r\nthe name of the period, the Rabbinical, for its chief work was the\r\ndevelopment and fixation of Rabbinism.\r\n\r\nDecadence did not set in immediately. Certain beneficent forces, either\r\ncontinuing in action from the former period, or arising out of the new\r\nconcatenation of circumstances, were in operation: Jewish exiles from\r\nSpain carried their culture to the asylums hospitably offered them in\r\nthe Orient and a few of the European countries, notably Holland; the art\r\nof printing was spreading, the first presses in Italy bringing out\r\nJewish works; and the sun of humanism and of the Reformation was rising\r\nand shedding solitary rays of its effulgence on the Jewish minds then at\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAmong the noteworthy authors standing between the two periods and\r\nbelonging to both, the most prominent is Nachmanides, a pious and\r\nlearned Bible scholar. With logical force and critical candor he entered\r\ninto the great conflict between science and faith, then dividing the\r\nJewish world into two camps, with Maimonides' works as their shibboleth.\r\nThe Aristotelian philosophy was no longer satisfying. Minds and hearts\r\nwere yearning for a new revelation, and in default thereof steeping\r\nthemselves in mystical speculations. A voluminous theosophic literature\r\nsprang up. The _Zohar_, the Bible of mysticism, was circulated, its\r\nauthorship being fastened upon a rabbi of olden days. It is altogether\r\nprobable that the real author was living at the time; many think that it\r\nwas Moses de Leon. The liberal party counted in its ranks the two\r\ndistinguished families of Tibbon and Kimchi, the former famed as\r\nsuccessful translators, the latter as grammarians. Their best known\r\nrepresentatives were Judah ibn Tibbon and David Kimchi. Curiously\r\nenough, the will of the former contains, in unmistakable terms, the\r\nopinion that \"Property is theft,\" anticipating Proudhon, who, had he\r\nknown it, would have seen in its early enunciation additional testimony\r\nto its truth. The liberal faction was also supported by Jacob ben\r\nAbba-Mari, the friend of Frederick II. and Michael Scotus. Abba-Mari\r\nlived at the German emperor's court at Naples, and quoted him in his\r\ncommentary upon the Bible as an exegete. Besides there were among the\r\nMaimunists, or rationalists, Levi ben Abraham, an extraordinarily\r\nliberal man; Shemtob Palquera, one of the most learned Jews of his\r\ncentury, and Yedaya Penini, a philosopher and pessimistic poet, whose\r\n\"Contemplation of the World\" was translated by Mendelssohn, and praised\r\nby Lessing and Goethe. Despite this array of talent, the opponents were\r\nstronger, the most representative partisan being the Talmudist Solomon\r\nben Aderet.\r\n\r\nAt the same time disputations about the Talmud, ending with its public\r\nburning at Paris, were carried on with the Christian clergy. The other\r\nliterary current of the age is designated by the word Kabbala, which\r\nheld many of the finest and noblest minds captive to its witchery. The\r\nKabbala is unquestionably a continuation of earlier theosophic\r\ninquiries. Its chief doctrines have been stated by a thorough student of\r\nour literature: All that exists originates in God, the source of light\r\neternal. He Himself can be known only through His manifestations. He is\r\nwithout beginning, and veiled in mystery, or, He is nothing, because the\r\nwhole of creation has developed from nothing. This nothing is one,\r\nindivisible, and limitless--_En-Sof_. God fills space, He is space\r\nitself. In order to manifest Himself, in order to create, that is,\r\ndisclose Himself by means of emanations, He contracts, thus producing\r\nvacant space. The _En-Sof_ first manifested itself in the prototype of\r\nthe whole of creation, in the macrocosm called the \"son of God,\" the\r\nfirst man, as he appears upon the chariot of Ezekiel. From this\r\nprimitive man the whole created world emanates in four stages: _Azila_,\r\n_Beria_, _Yezira_, _Asiya_. The _Azila_ emanation represents the active\r\nqualities of primitive man. They are forces or intelligences flowing\r\nfrom him, at once his essential qualities and the faculties by which he\r\nacts. There are ten of these forces, forming the ten sacred _Sefiroth_,\r\na word which first meaning number came to stand for sphere. The first\r\nthree _Sefiroth_ are intelligences, the seven others, attributes. They\r\nare supposed to follow each other in this order: 1. _Kether_ (crown); 2.\r\n_Chochma_ (wisdom); 3. _Beena_ (understanding); 4. _Chesed_ (grace), or\r\n_Ghedulla_ (greatness); 5. _Ghevoora_ (dignity); 6. _Tifereth_\r\n(splendor); 7. _Nezach_ (victory); 8. _Hod_ (majesty); 9. _Yesod_\r\n(principle); 10. _Malchuth_ (kingdom). From this first world of the\r\n_Azila_ emanate the three other worlds, _Asiya_ being the lowest stage.\r\nMan has part in these three worlds; a microcosm, he realizes in his\r\nactual being what is foreshadowed by the ideal, primitive man. He holds\r\nto the _Asiya_ by his vital part (_Nefesh_), to the _Yezira_ by his\r\nintellect (_Ruach_), to the _Beria_ by his soul (_Neshama_). The last is\r\nhis immortal part, a spark of divinity.\r\n\r\nSpeculations like these, followed to their logical issue, are bound to\r\nlead the investigator out of Judaism into Trinitarianism or Pantheism.\r\nKabbalists, of course only in rare cases, realized the danger. The sad\r\nconditions prevailing in the era after the expulsion from Spain, a third\r\nexile, were in all respects calculated to promote the development of\r\nmysticism, and it did flourish luxuriantly.\r\n\r\nSome few philosophers, the last of a long line, still await mention:\r\nLevi ben Gerson, Joseph Kaspi, Moses of Narbonne in southern France,\r\nlong a seat of Jewish learning; then, Isaac ben Sheshet, Chasdai\r\nCrescas, whose \"Light of God\" exercised deep influence upon Spinoza and\r\nhis philosophy; the Duran family, particularly Profiat Duran, successful\r\ndefender of Judaism against the attacks of apostates and Christians; and\r\nJoseph Albo, who in his principal philosophic work, _Ikkarim_, shows\r\nJudaism to be based upon three fundamental doctrines: the belief in the\r\nexistence of God, Revelation, and the belief in future reward and\r\npunishment. These writers are the last to reflect the glories of the\r\ngolden age.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance to the next period we again meet a man of extraordinary\r\nability, Isaac Abrabanel, one of the most eminent and esteemed of Bible\r\ncommentators, in early life minister to a Catholic king, later on a\r\npilgrim scholar wandering about exiled with his sons, one of whom,\r\nYehuda, has fame as the author of the _Dialoghi di Amore_. In the train\r\nof exiles passing from Portugal to the Orient are Abraham Zacuto, an\r\neminent historian of Jewish literature and sometime professor of\r\nastronomy at the university of Salamanca; Joseph ibn Verga, the\r\nhistorian of his nation; Amatus Lusitanus, who came close upon the\r\ndiscovery of the circulation of the blood; Israel Nagara, the most\r\ngifted poet of the century, whose hymns brought him popular favor;\r\nlater, Joseph Karo, \"the most influential personage of the sixteenth\r\ncentury,\" his claims upon recognition resting on the _Shulchan Aruch_,\r\nan exhaustive codex of Jewish customs and laws; and many others. In\r\nSalonica, the exiles soon formed a prosperous community, where\r\nflourished Jacob ibn Chabib, the first compiler of the Haggadistic tales\r\nof the Talmud, and afterwards David Conforte, a reputable historian. In\r\nJerusalem, Obadiah Bertinoro was engaged on his celebrated Mishna\r\ncommentary, in the midst of a large circle of Kabbalists, of whom\r\nSolomon Alkabez is the best known on account of his famous Sabbath song,\r\n_Lecho Dodi_. Once again Jerusalem was the objective point of many\r\npilgrims, lured thither by the prevalent Kabbalistic and Messianic\r\nvagaries. True literature gained little from such extremists. The only\r\nwork produced by them that can be admitted to have literary qualities is\r\nIsaiah Hurwitz's \"The Two Tables of the Testimony,\" even at this day\r\nenjoying celebrity. It is a sort of cyclopaedia of Jewish learning,\r\ncompiled and expounded from a mystic's point of view.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Jews in Italy was favorable, and their literary\r\nproducts derive grace from their good fortune. The Renaissance had a\r\nbenign effect upon them, and the revival of classical studies influenced\r\ntheir intellectual work. Greek thought met Jewish a third time. Learning\r\nwas enjoying its resurrection, and whenever their wretched political\r\nand social condition was not a hindrance, the Jews joined in the\r\ngeneral delight. Their misery, however, was an undiminishing burden,\r\nyea, even in the days in which, according to Erasmus, it was joy to\r\nlive. In fact, it was growing heavier. All the more noteworthy is it\r\nthat Hebrew studies engaged the research of scholars, albeit they showed\r\ncare for the word of God, and not for His people. Pico della Mirandola\r\nstudies the Kabbala; the Jewish grammarian Elias Levita is the teacher\r\nof Cardinal Egidio de Viterbo, and later of Paul Fagius and Sebastian\r\nMuenster, the latter translating his teacher's works into Latin; popes\r\nand sultans prefer Jews as their physicians in ordinary, who, as a rule,\r\nare men of literary distinction; the Jews translate philosophic writings\r\nfrom Hebrew and Arabic into Latin; Elias del Medigo is summoned as\r\narbiter in the scholastic conflict at the University of Padua;--all\r\nboots nothing, ruin is not averted. Reuchlin may protest as he will, the\r\nJew is exiled, the Talmud burnt.\r\n\r\nIn such dreary days the Portuguese Samuel Usque writes his work,\r\n_Consolacam as Tribulacoes de Ysrael_, and Joseph Cohen, his chronicle,\r\n\"The Vale of Weeping,\" the most important history produced since the day\r\nof Flavius Josephus,--additional proofs that the race possesses native\r\nbuoyancy, and undaunted heroism in enduring suffering. Women, too, in\r\nincreasing number, participate in the spiritual work of their nation;\r\namong them, Deborah Ascarelli and Sara Copia Sullam, the most\r\ndistinguished of a long array of names.\r\n\r\nThe keen critic and scholar, Azariah de Rossi, is one of the literary\r\ngiants of his period. His researches in the history of Jewish literature\r\nare the basis upon which subsequent work in this department rests, and\r\nmany of his conclusions still stand unassailable. About him are grouped\r\nAbraham de Portaleone, an excellent archaeologist, who established that\r\nJews had been the first to observe the medicinal uses of gold; David de\r\nPomis, the author of a famous defense of Jewish physicians; and Leo de\r\nModena, the rabbi of Venice, \"unstable as water,\" wavering between faith\r\nand unbelief, and, Kabbalist and rabbi though he was, writing works\r\nagainst the Kabbala on the one hand, and against rabbinical tradition on\r\nthe other. Similar to him in character is Joseph del Medigo, an\r\nitinerant author, who sometimes reviles, sometimes extols, the Kabbala.\r\n\r\nThere are men of higher calibre, as, for instance, Isaac Aboab, whose\r\n_Nomologia_ undertakes to defend Jewish tradition against every sort of\r\nassailant; Samuel Aboab, a great Bible scholar; Azariah Figo, a famous\r\npreacher; and, above all, Moses Chayyim Luzzatto, the first Jewish\r\ndramatist, the dramas preceding his having interest only as attempts.\r\nHe, too, is caught in the meshes of the Kabbala, and falls a victim to\r\nits powers of darkness. His dramas testify to poetic gifts and to\r\nextraordinary mastery of the Hebrew language, the faithful companion of\r\nthe Jewish nation in all its journeyings. To complete this sketch of the\r\nItalian Jews of that period, it should be added that while in intellect\r\nand attainments they stand above their brethren in faith of other\r\ncountries, in character and purity of morals they are their inferiors.\r\n\r\nThereafter literary interest centres in Poland, where rabbinical\r\nliterature found its most zealous and most learned exponents. Throughout\r\nthe land schools were established, in which the Talmud was taught by the\r\n_Pilpul_, an ingenious, quibbling method of Talmudic reasoning and\r\ndiscussion, said to have originated with Jacob Pollak. Again we have a\r\nlong succession of distinguished names. There are Solomon Luria, Moses\r\nIsserles, Joel Sirkes, David ben Levi, Sabbatai Kohen, and Elias Wilna.\r\nSabbatai Kohen, from whom, were pride of ancestry permissible in the\r\nrepublic of letters, the present writer would boast descent, was not\r\nonly a Talmudic writer; he also left historical and poetical works.\r\nElias Wilna, the last in the list, had a subtle, delicately poised mind,\r\nand deserves special mention for his determined opposition to the\r\nKabbala and its offspring Chassidism, hostile and ruinous to Judaism and\r\nJewish learning.\r\n\r\nA gleam of true pleasure can be obtained from the history of the Dutch\r\nJews. In Holland the Jews united secular culture with religious\r\ndevotion, and the professors of other faiths met them with tolerance and\r\nfriendliness. Sunshine falls upon the Jewish schools, and right into the\r\nheart of a youth, who straightway abandons the Talmud folios, and goes\r\nout into the world to proclaim to wondering mankind the evangel of a\r\nnew philosophy. The youth is Baruch Spinoza!\r\n\r\nThere are many left to expound Judaism: Manasseh ben Israel, writing\r\nboth Hebrew and Latin books to plead the cause of the emancipation of\r\nhis people and of its literary pre-eminence; David Neto, a student of\r\nphilosophy; Benjamin Mussafia, Orobio de Castro, David Abenator Melo,\r\nthe Spanish translator of the Psalms, and Daniel de Barrios, poet and\r\ncritic--all using their rapidly acquired fluency in the Dutch language\r\nto champion the cause of their people.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, a mixture of German and Hebrew had come into use among the\r\nJews as the medium of daily intercourse. In this peculiar patois, called\r\n_Judendeutsch_, a large literature had developed. Before Luther's time,\r\nit possessed two fine translations of the Bible, besides numerous\r\nwritings of an ethical, poetical, and historical character, among which\r\nparticular mention should be made of those on the German legend-cycles\r\nof the middle ages. At the same time, the Talmud receives its due of\r\ntime, effort, and talent. New life comes only with the era of\r\nemancipation and enlightenment.\r\n\r\nOnly a few names shall be mentioned, the rest would be bound soon to\r\nescape the memory of the casual reader: there is an historian, David\r\nGans; a bibliographer, Sabbatai Bassista, and the Talmudists Abigedor\r\nKara, Jacob Joshua, Jacob Emden, Jonathan Eibeschuetz, and Ezekiel\r\nLandau. It is delight to be able once again to chronicle the interest\r\ntaken in long neglected Jewish literature by such Christian scholars as\r\nthe two Buxtorfs, Bartolocci, Wolff, Surrenhuys, and De Rossi.\r\nUnfortunately, the interest dies out with them, and it is significant\r\nthat to this day most eminent theologians, decidedly to their own\r\ndisadvantage, \"content themselves with unreliable secondary sources,\"\r\ninstead of drinking from the fountain itself.\r\n\r\nWe have arrived at the sixth and last period, our own, not yet\r\ncompleted, whose fruits will be judged by a future generation. It is the\r\nperiod of the rejuvenescence of Jewish literature. Changes in character,\r\ntenor, form, and language take place. Germany for the first time is in\r\nthe van, and Mendelssohn, its most attractive figure, stands at the\r\nbeginning of the period, surrounded by his disciples Wessely, Homberg,\r\nEuchel, Friedlaender, and others, in conjunction with whom he gives Jews\r\na new, pure German Bible translation. Poetry and philology are zealously\r\npursued, and soon Jewish science, through its votaries Leopold Zunz and\r\nS. J. Rappaport, celebrates a brilliant renascence, such as the poet\r\ndescribes: \"In the distant East the dawn is breaking,--The olden times\r\nare growing young again.\"\r\n\r\n_Die Gottesdienstlichen Vortraege der Juden_, by Zunz, published in 1832,\r\nwas the pioneer work of the new Jewish science, whose present\r\ndevelopment, despite its wide range, has not yet exhausted the\r\nsuggestions made, by the author. Other equally important works from the\r\nsame pen followed, and then came the researches of Rappaport, Z.\r\nFrankel, I. M. Jost, M. Sachs, S. D. Luzzatto, S. Munk, A. Geiger, L.\r\nHerzfeld, H. Graetz, J. Fuerst, L. Dukes, M. Steinschneider, D. Cassel,\r\nS. Holdheim, and a host of minor investigators and teachers. Their\r\nloving devotion roused Jewish science and literature from their secular\r\nsleep to vigorous, intellectual life, reacting beneficently on the\r\nspiritual development of Judaism itself. The moulders of the new\r\nliterature are such men as the celebrated preachers Adolf Jellinek,\r\nSalomon, Kley, Mannheimer; the able thinkers Steinheim, Hirsch,\r\nKrochmal; the illustrious scholars M. Lazarus, H. Steinthal; and the\r\nversatile journalists G. Riesser and L. Philipson.\r\n\r\nPoetry has not been neglected in the general revival. The first Jewish\r\npoet to write in German was M. E. Kuh, whose tragic fate has been\r\npathetically told by Berthold Auerbach in his _Dichter und Kaufmann_.\r\nThe burden of this modern Jewish poetry is, of course, the glorification\r\nof the loyalty and fortitude that preserved the race during a calamitous\r\npast. Such poets as Steinheim, Wihl, L. A. Frankl, M. Beer, K. Beck, Th.\r\nCreizenach, M. Hartmann, S. H. Mosenthal, Henriette Ottenheimer, Moritz\r\nRappaport, and L. Stein, sing the songs of Zion in the tongue of the\r\nGerman. And can Heine be forgotten, he who in his _Romanzero_ has so\r\nmelodiously, yet so touchingly given word to the hoary sorrow of the\r\nJew?\r\n\r\nIn an essay of this scope no more can be done than give the barest\r\noutline of the modern movement. A detailed description of the work of\r\nGerman-Jewish lyrists belongs to the history of German literature, and,\r\nin fact, on its pages can be found a due appreciation of their worth by\r\nunprejudiced critics, who give particularly high praise to the new\r\nspecies of tales, the Jewish village, or Ghetto, tales, with which\r\nJewish and German literatures have latterly been enriched. Their object\r\nis to depict the religious customs in vogue among Jews of past\r\ngenerations, their home-life, and the conflicts that arose when the old\r\nJudaism came into contact with modern views of life. The master in the\r\nart of telling these Ghetto tales is Leopold Kompert. Of his\r\ndisciples--for all coming after him may be considered such--A. Bernstein\r\ndescribed the Jews of Posen; K. E. Franzos and L. Herzberg-Fraenkel,\r\nthose of Poland; E. Kulke, the Moravian Jews; M. Goldschmied, the Dutch;\r\nS. H. Mosenthal, the Hessian, and M. Lehmann, the South German. To\r\nBerthold Auerbach's pioneer work this whole class of literature owes its\r\nexistence; and Heinrich Heine's fragment, _Rabbi von Bacharach_, a model\r\nof its kind, puts him into this category of writers, too.\r\n\r\nAnd so Judaism and Jewish literature are stepping into a new arena, on\r\nwhich potent forces that may radically affect both are struggling with\r\neach other. Is Jewish poetry on the point of dying out, or is it\r\ndestined to enjoy a resurrection? Who would be rash enough to prophesy\r\naught of a race whose entire past is a riddle, whose literature is a\r\nquestion-mark? Of a race which for more than a thousand years has, like\r\nits progenitor, been wrestling victoriously with gods and men?\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate: We have followed out the course of a literary\r\ndevelopment, beginning in grey antiquity with biblical narratives,\r\nassimilating Persian doctrines, Greek wisdom, and Roman law; later,\r\nArabic poetry and philosophy, and, finally, the whole of European\r\nscience in all its ramifications. The literature we have described has\r\ncontributed its share to every spiritual result achieved by humanity,\r\nand is a still unexplored treasury of poetry and philosophy, of\r\nexperience and knowledge.\r\n\r\n\"All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is never full,\" saith the\r\nPreacher; so all spiritual currents flow together into the vast ocean of\r\na world-literature, never full, never complete, rejoicing in every\r\naccession, reaching the climax of its might and majesty on that day\r\nwhen, according to the prophet, \"the earth shall be full of the\r\nknowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TALMUD\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the whole range of the world's literatures there are few books with\r\nso checkered a career, so curious a fate, as the Talmud has had. The\r\nname is simple enough, it glides glibly from the tongue, yet how\r\ndifficult to explain its import to the uninitiated! From the Dominican\r\nHenricus Seynensis, who took \"Talmud\" to be the name of a rabbi--he\r\nintroduces a quotation with _Ut narrat rabbinus Talmud_, \"As Rabbi\r\nTalmud relates\"--down to the church historians and university professors\r\nof our day, the oddest misconceptions on the nature of the Talmud have\r\nprevailed even among learned men. It is not astonishing, then, that the\r\ngeneral reader has no notion of what it is.\r\n\r\nOnly within recent years the Talmud has been made the subject of\r\nscientific study, and now it is consulted by philologists, cited by\r\njurists, drawn upon by historians, the general public is beginning to be\r\ninterested in it, and of late the old Talmud has repeatedly been\r\nsummoned to appear in courts of law to give evidence. Under these\r\ncircumstances it is natural to ask, What is the Talmud? Futile to seek\r\nan answer by comparing this gigantic monument of the human intellect\r\nwith any other book; it is _sui generis_. In the form in which it issued\r\nfrom the Jewish academies of Babylonia and Palestine, it is a great\r\nnational work, a scientific document of first importance, the archives\r\nof ten centuries, in which are preserved the thoughts and opinions, the\r\nviews and verdicts, the errors, transgressions, hopes, disappointments,\r\ncustoms, ideals, convictions, and sorrows of Israel--a work produced by\r\nthe zeal and patience of thirty generations, laboring with a self-denial\r\nunparalleled in the history of literature. A work of this character\r\nassuredly deserves to be known. Unfortunately, the path to its\r\nunderstanding is blocked by peculiar linguistic and historical\r\ndifficulties. Above all, explanations by comparison must be avoided. It\r\nhas been likened to a legal code, to a journal, to the transactions of\r\nlearned bodies; but these comparisons are both inadequate and\r\nmisleading. To make it approximately clear a lengthy explanation must be\r\nentered upon, for, in truth, the Talmud, like the Bible, is a world in\r\nminiature, embracing every possible phase of life.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Talmud was simultaneous with Israel's return from the\r\nBabylonian exile, during which a wonderful change had taken place in the\r\ncaptive people. An idolatrous, rebellious nation had turned into a pious\r\ncongregation of the Lord, possessed with zeal for the study of the Law.\r\nBy degrees there grew up out of this study a science of wide scope,\r\nwhose beginnings are hidden in the last book of the Bible, in the word\r\n_Midrash_, translated by \"story\" in the Authorized Version. Its true\r\nmeaning is indicated by that of its root, _darash_, to study, to\r\nexpound. Four different methods of explaining the sacred Scriptures were\r\ncurrent: the first aimed to reach the simple understanding of words as\r\nthey stood; the second availed itself of suggestions offered by\r\napparently superfluous letters and signs in the text to arrive at its\r\nmeaning; the third was \"a homiletic application of that which had been\r\nto that which was and would be, of prophetical and historical dicta to\r\nthe actual condition of things\"; and the fourth devoted itself to\r\ntheosophic mysteries--but all led to a common goal.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the centuries the development of the Midrash, or study\r\nof the Law, lay along the two strongly marked lines of Halacha, the\r\nexplanation and formulating of laws, and Haggada, their poetical\r\nillustration and ethical application. These are the two spheres within\r\nwhich the intellectual life of Judaism revolved, and these the two\r\nelements, the legal and the aesthetic, making up the Talmud.\r\n\r\nThe two Midrashic systems emphasize respectively the rule of law and the\r\nsway of liberty: Halacha is law incarnate; Haggada, liberty regulated by\r\nlaw and bearing the impress of morality. Halacha stands for the rigid\r\nauthority of the Law, for the absolute importance of theory--the law and\r\ntheory which the Haggada illustrates by public opinion and the dicta of\r\ncommon-sense morality. The Halacha embraces the statutes enjoined by\r\noral tradition, which was the unwritten commentary of the ages on the\r\nwritten Law, along with the discussions of the academies of Palestine\r\nand Babylonia, resulting in the final formulating of the Halachic\r\nordinances. The Haggada, while also starting from the word of the Bible,\r\nonly plays with it, explaining it by sagas and legends, by tales and\r\npoems, allegories, ethical reflections, and historical reminiscences.\r\nFor it, the Bible was not only the supreme law, from whose behests there\r\nwas no appeal, but also \"a golden nail upon which\" the Haggada \"hung its\r\ngorgeous tapestries,\" so that the Bible word was the introduction,\r\nrefrain, text, and subject of the poetical glosses of the Talmud. It was\r\nthe province of the Halacha to build, upon the foundation of biblical\r\nlaw, a legal superstructure capable of resisting the ravages of time,\r\nand, unmindful of contemporaneous distress and hardship, to trace out,\r\nfor future generations, the extreme logical consequences of the Law in\r\nits application. To the Haggada belonged the high, ethical mission of\r\nconsoling, edifying, exhorting, and teaching a nation suffering the\r\npangs, and threatened with the spiritual stagnation, of exile; of\r\nproclaiming that the glories of the past prefigured a future of equal\r\nbrilliancy, and that the very wretchedness of the present was part of\r\nthe divine plan outlined in the Bible. If the simile is accurate that\r\nlikens the Halacha to the ramparts about Israel's sanctuary, which every\r\nJew was ready to defend with his last drop of blood, then the Haggada\r\nmust seem \"flowery mazes, of exotic colors and bewildering fragrance,\"\r\nwithin the shelter of the Temple walls.\r\n\r\nThe complete work of expounding, developing, and finally establishing\r\nthe Law represents the labor of many generations, the method of\r\nprocedure varying from time to time. In the long interval between the\r\nclose of the Holy Canon and the completion of the Talmud can be\r\ndistinguished three historical strata deposited by three different\r\nclasses of teachers. The first set, the Scribes--_Soferim_--flourished\r\nin the period beginning with the return from Babylonian captivity and\r\nending with the Syrian persecutions (220 B.C.E.), and their work was the\r\npreservation of the text of the Holy Writings and the simple expounding\r\nof biblical ordinances. They were followed by the\r\n\"Learners\"--_Tanaim_--whose activity extended until 220 C.E. Great\r\nhistorical events occurred in that period: the campaigns of the\r\nMaccabean heroes, the birth of Jesus, the destruction of the Temple by\r\nthe Romans, the rebellion under Bar-Kochba, and the final complete\r\ndispersion of the Jews. Amid all these storms the _Tanaim_ did not for a\r\nmoment relinquish their diligent research in the Law. The Talmud tells\r\nthe story of a celebrated rabbi, than which nothing can better\r\ncharacterize the age and its scholars: Night was falling. A funeral\r\ncortege was moving through the streets of old Jerusalem. It was said\r\nthat disciples were bearing a well-beloved teacher to the grave.\r\nReverentially the way was cleared, not even the Roman guard at the gate\r\nhindered the procession. Beyond the city walls it halted, the bier was\r\nset down, the lid of the coffin opened, and out of it arose the\r\nvenerable form of Rabbi Jochanan ben Zakkai, who, to reach the Roman\r\ncamp unmolested, had feigned death. He went before Vespasian, and,\r\nimpressed by the noble figure of the hoary rabbi, the general promised\r\nhim the fulfilment of any wish he might express. What was his petition?\r\nNot for his nation, not for the preservation of the Holy City, not even\r\nfor the Temple. His request was simple: \"Permit me to open a school at\r\nJabneh.\" The proud Roman smilingly gave consent. He had no conception of\r\nthe significance of this prayer and of the prophetic wisdom of the\r\npetitioner, who, standing on the ruins of his nation's independence,\r\nthought only of rescuing the Law. Rome, the empire of the \"iron legs,\"\r\nwas doomed to be crushed, nation after nation to be swallowed in the\r\nvortex of time, but Israel lives by the Law, the very law snatched from\r\nthe smouldering ruins of Jerusalem, the beloved alike of crazy zealots\r\nand despairing peace advocates, and carried to the tiny seaport of\r\nJabneh. There Jochanan ben Zakkai opened his academy, the gathering\r\nplace of the dispersed of his disciples and his people, and thence,\r\ngifted with a prophet's keen vision, he proclaimed Israel's mission to\r\nbe, not the offering of sacrifices, but the accomplishment of works of\r\npeace.[14]\r\n\r\nThe _Tanaim_ may be considered the most original expounders of the\r\nscience of Judaism, which they fostered at their academies. In the\r\ncourse of centuries their intellectual labor amassed an abundant store\r\nof scientific material, together with so vast a number of injunctions,\r\nprohibitions, and laws that it became almost impossible to master the\r\nsubject. The task of scholars now was to arrange the accumulation of\r\nmaterial and reduce it to a system. Rabbi after rabbi undertook the\r\ntask, but only the fourth attempt at codification, that made by Yehuda\r\nthe Prince, was successful. His compilation, classifying the\r\nsubject-matter under six heads, subdivided into sixty-three tractates,\r\ncontaining five hundred and twenty-four chapters, was called Mishna, and\r\ncame to be the authority appealed to on points of law.\r\n\r\nHaving assumed fixity as a code, the Mishna in turn became what the\r\nBible had been for centuries--a text, the basis of all legal development\r\nand scientific discussion. So it was used by the epigones, the\r\n_Amoraim_, or Speakers, the expounders of the third period. For\r\ngenerations commenting on the Mishna was the sum-total of literary\r\nendeavor. Traditions unheeded before sprang to light. New methods\r\nasserted themselves. To the older generation of Halachists succeeded a\r\nset of men headed by Akiba ben Joseph, who, ignoring practical issues,\r\nevolved laws from the Bible text or from traditions held to be divine. A\r\nspiritual, truly religious conception of Judaism was supplanted by legal\r\nquibbling and subtle methods of interpretation. Like the sophists of\r\nRome and Alexandria at that time, the most celebrated teachers in the\r\nacademies of Babylonia and Palestine for centuries gave themselves up to\r\ncasuistry. This is the history of the development of the Talmud, or more\r\ncorrectly of the two Talmuds, the one, finished in 390 C. E., being the\r\nexpression of what was taught at the Palestinian academies; the other,\r\nmore important one, completed in 500 C. E., of what was taught in\r\nBabylonia.\r\n\r\nThe Babylonian, the one regarded as authoritative, is about four times\r\nas large as the Jerusalem Talmud. Its thirty-six treatises\r\n(_Massichtoth_), in our present edition, cover upwards of three thousand\r\nfolio pages, bound in twelve huge volumes. To speak of a completed\r\nTalmud is as incorrect as to speak of a biblical canon. No religious\r\nbody, no solemn resolution of a synod, ever declared either the Talmud\r\nor the Bible a completed whole. Canonizing of any kind is distinctly\r\nopposed to the spirit of Judaism. The fact is that the tide of\r\ntraditional lore has never ceased to flow.\r\n\r\nWe now have before us a faint outline sketch of the growth of the\r\nTalmud. To portray the busy world fitting into this frame is another and\r\nmore difficult matter. A catalogue of its contents may be made. It may\r\nbe said that it is a book containing laws and discussions, philosophic,\r\ntheologic, and juridic dicta, historical notes and national\r\nreminiscences, injunctions and prohibitions controlling all the\r\npositions and relations of life, curious, quaint tales, ideal maxims and\r\nproverbs, uplifting legends, charming lyrical outbursts, and attractive\r\nenigmas side by side with misanthropic utterances, bewildering medical\r\nprescriptions, superstitious practices, expressions of deep agony,\r\npeculiar astrological charms, and rambling digressions on law,\r\nzoology, and botany, and when all this has been said, not half its\r\ncontents have been told. It is a luxuriant jungle, which must be\r\nexplored by him who would gain an adequate idea of its features and\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nThe Ghemara, that is, the whole body of discussions recorded in the two\r\nTalmuds, primarily forms a running commentary on the text of the Mishna.\r\nAt the same time, it is the arena for the debating and investigating of\r\nsubjects growing out of the Mishna, or suggested by a literature\r\ndeveloped along with the Talmudic literature. These discussions,\r\ndebates, and investigations are the opinions and arguments of the\r\ndifferent schools, holding opposite views, developed with rare acumen\r\nand scholastic subtlety, and finally harmonized in the solution reached.\r\nThe one firm and impregnable rock supporting the gigantic structure of\r\nthe Talmud is the word of the Bible, held sacred and inviolable.\r\n\r\nThe best translations--single treatises have been put into modern\r\nlanguages--fail to convey an adequate idea of the discussions and method\r\nthat evolved the Halacha. It is easier to give an approximately true\r\npresentation of the rabbinical system of practical morality as gleaned\r\nfrom the Haggada. It must, of course, be borne in mind that Halacha and\r\nHaggada are not separate works; they are two fibres of the same thread.\r\n\"The whole of the Haggadistic literature--the hitherto unappreciated\r\narchives of language, history, archaeology, religion, poetry, and\r\nscience--with but slight reservations may be called a national\r\nliterature, containing as it does the aggregate of the views and\r\nopinions of thousands of thinkers belonging to widely separated\r\ngenerations. Largely, of course, these views and opinions are peculiar\r\nto the individuals holding them or to their time\"; still, every\r\nHaggadistic expression, in a general way, illustrates some fundamental,\r\nnational law, based upon the national religion and the national\r\nhistory.[15] Through the Haggada we are vouchsafed a glance into a\r\nmysterious world, which mayhap has hitherto repelled us as strange and\r\ngrewsome. Its poesy reveals vistas of gleaming beauty and light,\r\nluxuriant growth and exuberant life, while familiar melodies caress our\r\nears.\r\n\r\nThe Haggada conveys its poetic message in the garb of allegory song, and\r\nchiefly epigrammatic saying. Form is disregarded; the spirit is\r\nall-important, and suffices to cover up every fault of form. The Talmud,\r\nof course, does not yield a complete system of ethics, but its practical\r\nphilosophy consists of doctrines that underlie a moral life. The\r\ninjustice of the abuse heaped upon it would become apparent to its\r\nharshest critics from a few of its maxims and rules of conduct, such as\r\nthe following: Be of them that are persecuted, not of the\r\npersecutors.--Be the cursed, not he that curses.--They that are\r\npersecuted, and do not persecute, that are vilified and do not retort,\r\nthat act in love, and are cheerful even in suffering, they are the\r\nlovers of God.--Bless God for the good as well as the evil. When thou\r\nhearest of a death, say, \"Blessed be the righteous Judge.\"--Life is like\r\nunto a fleeting shadow. Is it the shadow of a tower or of a bird? It is\r\nthe shadow of a bird in its flight. Away flies the bird, and neither\r\nbird nor shadow remains behind.--Repentance and good works are the aim\r\nof all earthly wisdom.--Even the just will not have so high a place in\r\nheaven as the truly repentant.--He whose learning surpasses his good\r\nworks is like a tree with many branches and few roots, which a\r\nwind-storm uproots and casts to the ground. But he whose good works\r\nsurpass his learning is like a tree with few branches and many roots;\r\nall the winds of heaven cannot move it from its place.--There are three\r\ncrowns: the crown of the Law, the crown of the priesthood, the crown of\r\nkingship. But greater than all is the crown of a good name.--Four there\r\nare that cannot enter Paradise: the scoffer, the liar, the hypocrite,\r\nand the backbiter.--Beat the gods, and the priests will\r\ntremble.--Contrition is better than many flagellations.--When the\r\npitcher falls upon the stone, woe unto the pitcher; when the stone falls\r\nupon the pitcher, woe unto the pitcher; whatever betides, woe unto the\r\npitcher.--The place does not honor the man, the man honors the\r\nplace.--He who humbles himself will be exalted; he who exalts himself\r\nwill be humbled,--Whosoever pursues greatness, from him will greatness\r\nflee; whosoever flees from greatness, him will greatness\r\npursue.--Charity is as important as all other virtues combined.--Be\r\ntender and yielding like a reed, not hard and proud like a cedar.--The\r\nhypocrite will not see God.--It is not sufficient to be innocent before\r\nGod; we must show our innocence to the world.--The works encouraged by a\r\ngood man are better than those he executes.--Woe unto him that practices\r\nusury, he shall not live; whithersoever he goes, he carries injustice\r\nand death.\r\n\r\nThe same Talmud that fills chapter after chapter with minute legal\r\ndetails and hairsplitting debates outlines with a few strokes the most\r\nideal conception of life, worth more than theories and systems of\r\nreligious philosophy. A Haggada passage says: Six hundred and thirteen\r\ninjunctions were given by Moses to the people of Israel. David reduced\r\nthem to eleven; the prophet Isaiah classified these under six heads;\r\nMicah enumerated only three: \"What doth the Lord require of thee, but to\r\ndo justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.\" Another\r\nprophet limited them to two: \"Keep ye judgment, and do righteousness.\"\r\nAmos put all the commandments under one: \"Seek ye me, and ye shall\r\nlive\"; and Habakkuk said: \"The just shall live by his faith.\"--This is\r\nthe ethics of the Talmud.\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic manifestation of the idealism of the Talmud is\r\nits delicate feeling for women and children. Almost extravagant\r\naffection is displayed for the little ones. All the verses of Scripture\r\nthat speak of flowers and gardens are applied in the Talmud to children\r\nand schools. Their breath sustains the moral order of the universe: \"Out\r\nof the mouth of babes and sucklings has God founded His might.\" They are\r\ncalled flowers, stars, the anointed of God. When God was about to give\r\nthe Law, He demanded of the Israelites pledges to assure Him that they\r\nwould keep His commandments holy. They offered the patriarchs, but each\r\none of them had committed some sin. They named Moses as their surety;\r\nnot even he was guiltless. Then they said: \"Let our children be our\r\nhostages.\" The Lord accepted them.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, there are many expressions to show that woman was held in\r\nhigh esteem by the rabbis of the Talmud: Love thy wife as thyself; honor\r\nher more than thyself.--In choosing a wife, descend a step.--If thy wife\r\nis small, bend and whisper into her ear.--God's altar weeps for him that\r\nforsakes the love of his youth.--He who sees his wife die before him\r\nhas, as it were, been present at the destruction of the sanctuary\r\nitself; around him the world grows dark.--It is woman alone through whom\r\nGod's blessings are vouchsafed to a house.--The children of him that\r\nmarries for money shall be a curse unto him,--a warning singularly\r\napplicable to the circumstances of our own times.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar charm of the Haggada is best revealed in its legends and\r\ntales, its fables and myths, its apologues and allegories, its riddles\r\nand songs. The starting-point of the Haggada usually is some memory of\r\nthe great past. It entwines and enmeshes in a magic network the lives of\r\nthe patriarchs, prophets, and martyrs, and clothes with fresh, luxuriant\r\ngreen the old ideals and figures, giving them new life for a remote\r\ngeneration. The teachers of the Haggada allow no opportunity, sad or\r\nmerry, to pass without utilizing it in the guise of an apologue or\r\nparable. Alike for wedding-feasts and funerals, for banquets and days of\r\nfasting, the garden of the Haggada is rifled of its fragrant blossoms\r\nand luscious fruits. Simplicity, grace, and childlike merriment pervade\r\nits fables, yet they are profound, even sublime, in their truth. \"Their\r\nchief and enduring charm is their fathomless depth, their unassuming\r\nloveliness.\" Poems constructed with great artistic skill do not occur.\r\nHere and there a modest bud of lyric poesy shyly raises its head, like\r\nthe following couplet, describing a celebrated but ill-favored rabbi:\r\n\r\n    \"Without charm of form and face.\r\n    But a mind of rarest grace.\"\r\n\r\nOver the grave of the same teacher the Talmud wails:\r\n\r\n    \"The Holy Land did beautify what womb of Shinar gave;\r\n    And now Tiberias' tear-filled eye weeps o'er her treasure's grave.\"\r\n\r\nOn seeing the dead body of the Patriarch Yehuda, a rabbi laments:\r\n\r\n    \"Angels strove to win the testimony's ark.\r\n    Men they overcame; lo! vanished is the ark!\"\r\n\r\nAnother threnody over some prince in the realm of the intellect:\r\n\r\n    \"The cedar hath by flames been seized;\r\n    Can hyssop then be saved?\r\n    Leviathan with hook was caught;\r\n    Alas! ye little fish!\r\n    The deep and mighty stream ran dry,\r\n    Ah woe! ye shallow brooks!\"\r\n\r\nNor is humor lacking. \"Ah, hamper great, with books well-filled, thou'rt\r\ngone!\" is a bookworm's eulogy.\r\n\r\nPoets naturally have not been slow to avail themselves of the material\r\nstored in the Haggada. Many of its treasures, tricked out in modern\r\nverse, have been given to the world. The following are samples:[16]\r\n\r\n    BIRTH AND DEATH\r\n\r\n    \"His hands fast clenched, his fingers firmly clasped,\r\n    So man this life begins.\r\n    He claims earth's wealth, and constitutes himself\r\n    The heir of all her gifts.\r\n    He thinks his hand may snatch and hold\r\n    Whatever life doth yield.\r\n\r\n    But when at last the end has come,\r\n    His hands are open wide,\r\n    No longer closed. He knoweth now full well,\r\n    That vain were all his hopes.\r\n    He humbly says, 'I go, and nothing take\r\n    Of all my hands have wrought.'\"\r\n\r\nThe next, \"Interest and Usury,\" may serve to give the pertinacious\r\nopponent of the Talmud a better opinion of its position on financial\r\nsubjects:\r\n\r\n    \"Behold! created things of every kind\r\n      Lend each to each. The day from night doth take,\r\n      And night from day; nor do they quarrel make\r\n    Like men, who doubting one another's mind,\r\n    E'en while they utter friendly words, think ill.\r\n      The moon delighted helps the starry host,\r\n      And each returns her gift without a boast.\r\n    'Tis only when the Lord supreme doth will\r\n    That earth in gloom shall be enwrapped,\r\n      He tells the moon: 'Refrain, keep back thy light!'\r\n      And quenches, too, the myriad lamps of night.\r\n    From wisdom's fount hath knowledge ofttimes lapped,\r\n    While wisdom humbly doth from knowledge learn.\r\n      The skies drop blessings on the grateful earth,\r\n      And she--of precious store there is no dearth--\r\n    Exhales and sends aloft a fair return.\r\n    Stern law with mercy tempers its decree,\r\n      And mercy acts with strength by justice lent.\r\n      Good deeds are based on creed from heaven sent,\r\n    In which, in turn, the sap of deeds must be.\r\n      Each creature borrows, lends, and gives with love,\r\n      Nor e'er disputes, to honor God above.\r\n\r\n    When man, howe'er, his fellowman hath fed,\r\n      Then 'spite the law forbidding interest,\r\n      He thinketh naught but cursed gain to wrest.\r\n    Who taketh usury methinks hath said:\r\n    'O Lord, in beauty has Thy earth been wrought!\r\n      But why should men for naught enjoy its plains?\r\n      Ask usance, since 'tis Thou that sendest rains.\r\n    Have they the trees, their fruits, and blossoms bought?\r\n    For all they here enjoy, Thy int'rest claim:\r\n      For heaven's orbs that shine by day and night,\r\n      Th' immortal soul enkindled by Thy light,\r\n    And for the wondrous structure of their frame.'\r\n    But God replies: 'Now come, and see! I give\r\n      With open, bounteous hand, yet nothing take;\r\n      The earth yields wealth, nor must return ye make.\r\n    But know, O men, that only while ye live,\r\n    You may enjoy these gifts of my award.\r\n      The capital's mine, and surely I'll demand\r\n      The spirit in you planted by my hand,\r\n    And also earth will claim her due reward.'\r\n      Man's dust to dust is gathered in the grave,\r\n      His soul returns to God who gracious gave.\"\r\n\r\nR. Yehuda ben Zakkai answers his pupils who ask:\r\n\r\n    \"Why doth the Law with them more harshly deal\r\n      That filch a lamb from fold away,\r\n    Than with the highwaymen who shameless steal\r\n      Thy purse by force in open day?\"\r\n\r\n    \"Because in like esteem the brigands hold\r\n      The master and his serving man.\r\n    Their wickedness is open, frank, and bold,\r\n      They fear not God, nor human ban.\r\n\r\n    The thief feels more respect for earthly law\r\n      Than for his heav'nly Master's eye,\r\n    Man's presence flees in fear and awe,\r\n      Forgets he's seen by God on high.\"\r\n\r\nThat is a glimpse of the world of the Haggada--a wonderful, fantastic\r\nworld, a kaleidoscopic panorama of enchanting views. \"Well can we\r\nunderstand the distress of mind in a mediaeval divine, or even in a\r\nmodern _savant_, who, bent upon following the most subtle windings of\r\nsome scientific debate in the Talmudical pages--geometrical, botanical,\r\nfinancial, or otherwise--as it revolves round the Sabbath journey, the\r\nraising of seeds, the computation of tithes and taxes--feels, as it\r\nwere, the ground suddenly give way. The loud voices grow thin, the doors\r\nand walls of the school-room vanish before his eyes, and in their place\r\nuprises Rome the Great, the _Urbs et Orbis_ and her million-voiced life.\r\nOr the blooming vineyards round that other City of Hills, Jerusalem the\r\nGolden herself, are seen, and white-clad virgins move dreamily among\r\nthem. Snatches of their songs are heard, the rhythm of their choric\r\ndances rises and falls: it is the most dread Day of Atonement itself,\r\nwhich, in poetical contrast, was chosen by the 'Rose of Sharon' as a day\r\nof rejoicing to walk among those waving lily-fields and vine-clad\r\nslopes. Or the clarion of rebellion rings high and shrill through the\r\ncomplicated debate, and Belshazzar, the story of whose ghastly banquet\r\nis told with all the additions of maddening horror, is doing service for\r\nNero the bloody; or Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian tyrant, and all his\r\nhosts, are cursed with a yelling curse--_a propos_ of some utterly\r\ninappropriate legal point, while to the initiated he stands for Titus\r\nthe--at last exploded--'Delight of Humanity.' ... Often--far too often\r\nfor the interests of study and the glory of the human race--does the\r\nsteady tramp of the Roman cohort, the password of the revolution, the\r\nshriek and clangor of the bloody field, interrupt these debates, and\r\nthe arguing masters and disciples don their arms, and, with the cry,\r\n'Jerusalem and Liberty,' rush to the fray.\"[17] Such is the world of the\r\nTalmud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JEW IN THE HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION[18]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the childhood of civilization, the digging of wells was regarded as\r\nbeneficent work. Guide-posts, visible from afar, marked their position,\r\nand hymns were composed, and solemn feasts celebrated, in honor of the\r\nevent. One of the choicest bits of early Hebrew poetry is a song of the\r\nwell. The soul, in grateful joy, jubilantly calls to her mates: \"Arise!\r\nsing a song unto the well! Well, which the princes have dug, which the\r\nnobles of the people have hollowed out.\"[19] This house, too, is a\r\nguide-post to a newly-found well of humanity and culture, a monument to\r\nour faithfulness and zeal in the recognition and the diffusion of truth.\r\nA scene like this brings to my mind the psalmist's beautiful words:[20]\r\n\"Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together\r\nin unity. It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down\r\nupon the beard, even Aaron's beard, that went down to the skirts of his\r\ngarment; as the dew of Hermon, running down upon the mountains of Zion;\r\nfor there hath the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for\r\nevermore.\"\r\n\r\nWondrous thoughts veiled with wondrous imagery! The underlying meaning\r\nwill lead us to our feast of the well, our celebration in honor of\r\nnewly-discovered waters. Our order is based upon the conviction that all\r\nmen should be banded together for purposes of humanity. But what is\r\nhumanity? Not philanthropy, not benevolence, not charity: it is \"human\r\nculture risen to the stage on which man is conscious of universal\r\nbrotherhood, and strives for the realization of the general good.\" In\r\nearly times, leaders of men were anointed with oil, symbol of wisdom and\r\ndivine inspiration. Above all it was meet that it be used in the\r\nconsecration of priests, the exponents of the divine spirit and the Law.\r\nThe psalmist's idea is, that as the precious ointment in its abundance\r\nruns down Aaron's beard to the hem of his garment, even so shall wisdom\r\nand the divine spirit overflow the lips of priests, the guides, friends,\r\nand teachers of the people, the promoters of the law of peace and love.\r\n\r\n\"As the dew of Hermon, running down upon the mountains of Zion!\" High\r\nabove all mountains towers Hermon, its crest enveloped by clouds and\r\ncovered with eternal snow. From that supernal peak grateful dew trickles\r\ndown, fructifying the land once \"flowing with milk and honey.\" From its\r\nclefts gushes forth Jordan, mightiest stream of the land, watering a\r\nbroad plain in its course. In this guise the Lord has granted His\r\nblessing to the land, the blessing of civilization and material\r\nprosperity, from which spring as corollaries the duties of charity and\r\nuniversal humanity.\r\n\r\nA picture of the olden time this, a lodge-address of the days of the\r\npsalm singers. Days flee, time abides; men pass away, mankind endures.\r\nFilled with time-honored thoughts, inspired by the hopes of by-gone\r\ngenerations, striving for the goal of noble men in all ages, like the\r\npsalm singers in the days of early culture, we celebrate a feast of the\r\nwell by reviewing the past and looking forward down the avenues of time.\r\n\r\nLess than fifty years ago a band of energetic, loyal Jews, on the other\r\nside of the Atlantic, founded our beloved Order. Now it has established\r\nitself in every part of the world, from the extreme western coast of\r\nAmerica to the blessed meadows of the Jordan; yea, even the Holy Land,\r\nunfurling everywhere the banner of charity, brotherly love, and unity,\r\nand seeking to spread education and culture, the forerunners of\r\nhumanity. Judaism, mark you, is the religion of humanity. By far too\r\nlate for our good and that of mankind, we began to proclaim this truth\r\nwith becoming energy and emphasis, and to demonstrate it with the\r\njoyousness of conviction. The question is, are we permeated with this\r\nconviction? Our knowledge of Judaism is slight; we have barely a\r\nsuspicion of what in the course of centuries, nay, of thousands of\r\nyears, it has done for the progress of civilization. In my estimation,\r\nour house-warming cannot more fittingly be celebrated than by taking a\r\nbird's-eye view of Jewish culture.\r\n\r\nThe Bible is the text-book of general literature. Out of the Bible, more\r\nparticularly from the Ten Commandments, flashed from Sinai, mankind\r\nlearned its first ethical lesson in a system which still satisfies its\r\nneeds. To convey even a faint idea of what the Bible has done for\r\ncivilization, morality, and the literature of every people--of the\r\ninnumerable texts it has furnished to poets, and subjects to\r\npainters--would in itself require a literature.\r\n\r\nThe conflicts with surrounding nations to which they were exposed made\r\nthe Jews concentrate their forces, and so enabled them to wage\r\nsuccessful war with nations mightier than themselves. Their heroism\r\nunder the Maccabees and under Bar-Kochba, in the middle ages and in\r\nmodern days, permits them to take rank among the most valiant in\r\nhistory. A historian of literature, a non-Jew, enumerates three factors\r\nconstituting Jews important agents in the preservation and revival of\r\nlearning:[21] First, their ability as traders. The Phoenicians are\r\nregarded as the oldest commercial nation, but the Jews contested the\r\npalm with them. Zebulon and Asher in very early times were seafaring\r\ntribes. Under Solomon, Israelitish vessels sailed as far as Ophir to\r\nbring Afric's gold to Jerusalem. Before the destruction of the Holy\r\nCity, Jewish communities established themselves on the westernmost coast\r\nof Europe. \"The whole of the known world was covered with their\r\nsettlements, in constant communication with one another through\r\nitinerant merchants, who effected an exchange of learning as well as of\r\nwares; while the other nations grew more and more isolated, and shut\r\nthemselves off from even the sparse opportunities of mental culture then\r\navailable.\"\r\n\r\nThe second factor conducing to mental advancement was the schools which\r\nhave flourished in Israel since the days of the prophet Samuel; and the\r\nthird was the linguistic attainments of the Jews, which they owed to\r\nnatural ability in this direction. Scarcely had Greek allied itself with\r\nHebrew thought, when Jews in Alexandria wrote Greek comparable with\r\nPlato's, and not more than two hundred years after the settlement of\r\nJews in Arabia we meet with a large number of Jewish poets among\r\nMohammed's disciples, while in the middle ages they taught and wrote\r\nArabic, Spanish, French, and German--versatility naturally favorable to\r\nintellectual progress.\r\n\r\nJewish influence may be said to have begun to exercise itself upon\r\ngeneral culture when Judaism and Hellenism met for the first time. The\r\nresult of the meeting was the new product, Judaeo-Hellenic literature.\r\nGreek civilization was attractive to Jews. The new ideas were\r\npopularized for all strata of the people to imbibe. Shortly before the\r\nold pagan world crumbled, Hellenism enjoyed a beautiful, unexpected\r\nrevival in Alexandria. There, strange to say, Judaism, in its home\r\nantagonistic to Hellenism, had filled and allied itself with the Greek\r\nspirit. Its literature gradually adopted Greek traditions, and the ripe\r\nfruit of the union was the Jewish-Alexandrian religious philosophy, the\r\nmediation between two sharply contradictory systems, for the first time\r\nbrought into close juxtaposition, and requiring some such new element to\r\nharmonize them. When ancient civilization in Judaea and in Hellas fell\r\ninto decay, human endeavor was charged with the task of reconciling\r\nthese two great historical forces diametrically opposed to each other,\r\nand the first attempt looking to this end was inspired by a Jewish\r\ngenius, Jesus of Nazareth.\r\n\r\nThe Jews of Alexandria were engaged in widespread trade and shipping,\r\nand they counted among them artists, poets, civil officers, and\r\nmechanics. They naturally acquired Greek customs, and along with them\r\nHellenic vices. The bacchanalia of Athens were enthusiastically imitated\r\nin Jerusalem, and, as a matter of course, in Alexandria. This point\r\nreached, Roman civilization asserted itself, and the people sought to\r\naffiliate with their Roman victors, while the rabbis devoted themselves\r\nto the Law, not, however, to the exclusion of scientific work. In the\r\nranks of physicians and astronomers we find Jewish masters and Jewish\r\ndisciples. Medicine has always been held in high esteem by Jews, and\r\nSamuel could justly boast before his contemporaries that the intricate\r\ncourses of the stars were as well known to him as the streets of\r\nNehardea in Babylonia.[22]\r\n\r\nThe treasures of information on pedagogics, medicine, jurisprudence,\r\nastronomy, geography, zoology, botany, and last, though not least, on\r\ngeneral history, buried in the Talmud, have hitherto not been valued at\r\ntheir true worth. The rabbis of the Talmud stood in the front ranks of\r\nculture. They compiled a calendar, in complete accord with the Metonic\r\ncycle, which modern science must declare faultless. Their classification\r\nof the bones of the human body varies but little from present results of\r\nthe science of anatomy, and the Talmud demonstrates that certain Mishna\r\nordinances are based upon geometrical propositions, which could have\r\nbeen known to but few mathematicians of that time. Rabbi Gamaliel, said\r\nto have made use of a telescope, was celebrated as a mathematician and\r\nastronomer, and in 289 C. E., Rabbi Joshua is reported to have\r\ncalculated the orbit of Halley's comet.\r\n\r\nThe Roman conquest of Palestine effected a change in the condition of\r\nthe Jews. Never before had Judah undergone such torture and suffering as\r\nunder the sceptre of Rome. The misery became unendurable, and internal\r\ndisorders being added to foreign oppression, the luckless insurrection\r\nbroke out which gave the deathblow to Jewish nationality, and drove\r\nJudah into exile. On his thorny martyr's path he took naught with him\r\nbut a book--his code, his law. Yet how prodigal his contributions to\r\nmankind's fund of culture!\r\n\r\nAbout five hundred years later Judah saw springing up on his own soil a\r\nnew religion which appropriated the best and the most beautiful of his\r\nspiritual possessions. Swiftly rose the vast political and intellectual\r\nstructure of Mohammedan power, and as before with Greek, so Jewish\r\nthought now allied itself with Arabic endeavor, bringing forth in Spain\r\nthe golden age of neo-Hebraic literature in the spheres of poetry,\r\nmetaphysical speculation, and every department of scientific research.\r\nIt is not an exaggerated estimate to say that the middle ages sustained\r\nthemselves with the fruit of this intellectual labor, which, moreover,\r\nhas come down as a legacy to our modern era. Two hundred years after\r\nMohammed, the same language, Arabic, was spoken by the Jews of Kairwan\r\nand those of Bagdad. Thus equipped, they performed in a remarkable way\r\nthe task allotted them by their talents and their circumstances, to\r\nwhich they had been devoting themselves with singular zeal for two\r\ncenturies. The Jews are missioned mediators between the Orient and the\r\nOccident, and their activity as such, illustrated by their additions to\r\ngeneral culture and science, is of peculiar interest. In the period\r\nunder consideration, their linguistic accomplishments fitted them to\r\nassist the Syrians in making Greek literature accessible to the Arabic\r\nmind. In Arabic literature itself, they attained to a prominent place.\r\nModern research has not yet succeeded in shedding light upon the\r\ndevelopment and spread of science among the Arabs under the tutelage of\r\nSyrian Christians. But out of the obscurity of Greek-Arabic culture\r\nbeginnings gleam Jewish names, whose possessors were the teachers of\r\neager Arabic disciples. Barely fifty years after the hosts of the\r\nProphet had conquered the Holy Land, a Jew of Bassora translated from\r\nSyriac into Arabic the pandects by the presbyter Aaron, a famous medical\r\nwork of the middle ages. In the annals of the next century, among the\r\nearly contributors to Arabic literature, we meet with the names of Jews\r\nas translators of medical, mathematical, and astronomical works, and as\r\ngrammarians, astronomers, scientists, and physicians. A Jew translated\r\nPtolemy's \"Almagest\"; another assisted in the first translation of the\r\nIndian fox fables (_Kalila we-Dimna_); the first furnishing the middle\r\nages with the basis of their astronomical science, the second supplying\r\nEuropean poets with literary material. Through the instrumentality of\r\nJews, Arabs became acquainted as early as the eighth century, some time\r\nbefore the learning of the Greeks was brought within their reach, with\r\nIndian medicine, astronomy, and poetry. Greek science itself they owed\r\nto Jewish mediation. Not only among Jews, but also among Greeks,\r\nSyrians, and Arabs, Jewish versatility gave currency to the belief that\r\n\"all wisdom is of the Jews,\" a view often repeated by Hellenists, by the\r\n\"Righteous Brethren\" among the Arabs, and later by the Christian monks\r\nof Europe.\r\n\r\nThe academies of the Jews have always been pervaded by a scientific\r\nspirit. As they influenced others, so they permitted the science and\r\nculture of their neighbors to act upon their life and work. There is no\r\ndoubt, for instance, that, despite the marked difference between the\r\nsubjects treated by Arabs and Jews, the peculiar qualities of the old\r\nArabic lyrics shaped neo-Hebraic poetry. Again, as the Hebrew acrostic\r\npsalms demonstrably served as models to the older Syrian Church poets,\r\nso, in turn, Syriac psalmody probably became the pattern synagogue\r\npoetry followed. Thus Hebrew poetry completed a circuit, which, to be\r\nsure, cannot accurately be followed up through its historical stages,\r\nbut which critical investigations and the comparative study of\r\nliteratures have established almost as a certainty.\r\n\r\nIn the ninth century a bold, venturesome traveller, Eldad ha-Dani,[23] a\r\nsort of Jewish Ulysses, appeared among Jews, and at the same time\r\nJudaism produced Sa'adia, its first great religious philosopher and\r\nBible translator. The Church Fathers had always looked up to the rabbis\r\nas authorities; henceforth Jews were accepted by all scholars as the\r\nteachers of Bible exegesis. Sa'adia was the first of the rabbis to\r\ntranslate the Hebrew Scriptures into Arabic. Justly his work is said to\r\n\"recognize the current of thought dominant in his time, and to express\r\nthe newly-awakened desire for the reconciliation of religious practice,\r\nas developed in the course of generations, with the source of religious\r\ninspiration.\" Besides, he was the first to elaborate a system of\r\nreligious philosophy according to a rigid plan, and in a strictly\r\nscientific spirit.[24] Knowing Greek speculations, he controverts them\r\nas vigorously as the _Kalam_ of Islam philosophy. His teachings form a\r\nsystem of practical ethics, luminous reflections, and sound maxims.\r\nAmong his contemporaries was Isaac Israeli, a physician at Kairwan,\r\nwhose works, in their Latin translation by the monk Constantine,\r\nattained great reputation, and were later plagiarized by medical\r\nwriters. His treatise on fever was esteemed of high worth, a translation\r\nof it being studied as a text-book for centuries, and his dietetic\r\nwritings remained authoritative for five hundred years. In general, the\r\nmedical science of the Arabs is under great obligations to him.\r\nReverence for Jewish medical ability was so exaggerated in those days\r\nthat Galen was identified with the Jewish sage Gamaliel. The error was\r\nfostered in the _Sefer Asaf_, a curious medical fragment of uncertain\r\nauthorship and origin, by its rehearsal of an old Midrash, which traces\r\nthe origin of medicine to Shem, son of Noah, who received it from\r\nangels, and transmitted it to the ancient Chaldeans, they in turn\r\npassing it on to the Egyptians, Greeks, and Arabs.\r\n\r\nThough the birth of medicine is not likely to have taken place among\r\nJews, it is indisputable that physicians of the Jewish race are largely\r\nto be credited with the development of medical science at every period.\r\nAt the time we speak of, Jews in Egypt, northern Africa, Italy, Spain,\r\nFrance, and Germany were physicians in ordinary to caliphs, emperors,\r\nand popes, and everywhere they are represented among medical writers.\r\nThe position occupied in the Arabian world by Israeli, in the Occident\r\nwas occupied by Sabattai Donnolo, one of the Salerno school in its early\r\nobscure days, the author of a work on _Materia medica_, possibly the\r\noldest original production on medicine in the Hebrew language.\r\n\r\nThe period of Jewish prosperity in Spain has been called a fairy vision\r\nof history. The culture developed under its genial influences pervaded\r\nthe middle ages, and projected suggestions even into our modern era. One\r\nof the most renowned _savants_ at the beginning of the period was the\r\nstatesman Chasdai ben Shaprut, whose translation of Dioscorides's \"Plant\r\nLore\" served as the botanical textbook of mediaeval Europe. The first\r\npoet was Solomon ibn Gabirol, the author of \"The Source of Life,\" a\r\nsystematic exposition of Neoplatonic philosophy, a book of most curious\r\nfortunes. Through the Latin translation, made with the help of an\r\napostate Jew, and bearing the author's name in the mutilated form of\r\nAvencebrol, later changed into Avicebron, scholasticism became saturated\r\nwith its philosophic ideas. The pious fathers of Christian philosophy,\r\nAlbertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas, took pains to refute them, while\r\nDuns Scotus and Giordano Bruno frequently consulted the work as an\r\nauthority. In the struggle between the Scotists and the Thomists it had\r\na prominent place as late as the fourteenth century, the contestants\r\ntaking it to be the work of some great Christian philosopher standing on\r\nthe threshold of the Occident and at the portals of philosophy. So it\r\nhappened that the author came down through the centuries, recognized by\r\nnone, forgotten by his own, until, in our time, behind the\r\nMoorish-Christian mask of Avencebrol, Solomon Munk discovered the Jewish\r\nthinker and poet Solomon ibn Gabirol.\r\n\r\nThe work _De Causis_, attributed to David, a forgotten Jewish\r\nphilosopher, must be classed with Gabirol's \"Source of Life,\" on account\r\nof its Neoplatonism and its paramount influence upon scholasticism. In\r\nfact, only by means of a searching analysis of these two works can\r\ninsight be gained into the development and aberrations of the dogmatic\r\nsystem of mediaeval philosophy.\r\n\r\nOther sciences, too, especially mathematics, flourished among them. One\r\ncentury after he wrote them, the works of Abraham ibn Ezra, renowned as\r\nan astronomer and mathematician, were translated into Latin by Italians,\r\namong whom his prestige was so great that, as may still be seen, he was\r\npainted among the expounders of mathematical science in an Italian\r\nchurch fresco representing the seven liberal arts. Under the name\r\nAbraham Judaeus, later corrupted into Avenare, he is met with throughout\r\nthe middle ages. Abraham ben Chiya, another distinguished scientist,\r\nknown by the name Savasorda, compiled the first systematic outline of\r\nastronomy, and in his geographical treatise, he explained the sphericity\r\nof the earth, while the Latin translation of his geometry, based on\r\nArabic sources, proves him to have made considerable additions to the\r\nstock of knowledge in this branch. Moses Maimuni's intellectual vigor,\r\nand his influence upon the schoolmen through his medical, and more\r\nparticularly his religio-philosophical works, are too well known to need\r\nmore than passing mention.\r\n\r\nEven in southern France and in Germany, whither the light of culture did\r\nnot spread so rapidly as in Spain, Jews participated in the development\r\nof the sciences. Solomon ben Isaac, called Rashi, the great exegete, was\r\nlooked up to as an authority by others beside his brethren in faith.\r\nNicolas de Lyra, one of the most distinguished Christian Bible exegetes,\r\nconfesses that his simple explanations of Scriptural passages are\r\nderived pre-eminently from Rashi's Bible commentary, and among\r\nscientific men it is acknowledged that precisely in the matter of\r\nexegesis this French monk exercised decisive influence upon Martin\r\nLuther. So it happens that in places Luther's Bible translation reveals\r\nRashi seen through Nicolas de Lyra's spectacles.\r\n\r\nIn the quickened intellectual life of Provence Jews also took active\r\npart. David Kimchi has come to be regarded as the teacher _par\r\nexcellence_ of Hebrew grammar and lexicography, and Judah ibn Tibbon,\r\none of the most notable of translators, in his testament addressed to\r\nhis son made a complete presentation of contemporary science, a\r\ncyclopaedia of the Arabic and the Hebrew language and literature,\r\ngrammar, poetry, botany, zoology, natural history, and particularly\r\nreligious philosophy, the studies of the Bible and the Talmud.\r\n\r\nThe golden age of letters was followed by a less creative period, a\r\nsignificant turning-point in the history of Judaism as of spiritual\r\nprogress in general. The contest between tradition and philosophy\r\naffected every mind. Literature was widely cultivated; each of its\r\ndepartments found devotees. The European languages were studied, and\r\nconnections established between the literatures of the nations. Hardly a\r\nspiritual current runs through the middle ages without, in some way,\r\naffecting Jewish culture. It is the irony of history that puts among the\r\nforty proscribers of the Talmud assembled at Paris in the thirteenth\r\ncentury the Dominican Albertus Magnus, who, in his successful efforts to\r\ndivert scholastic philosophy into new channels, depended entirely upon\r\nthe writings and translations of the very Jews he was helping to\r\npersecute. Schoolmen were too little conversant with Greek to read\r\nAristotle in the original, and so had to content themselves with\r\naccepting the Judaeo-Arabic construction put upon the Greek sage's\r\nteachings.\r\n\r\nBesides acting as intermediaries, Jews made original contributions to\r\nscholastic philosophy. For instance, Maimonides, the first to reconcile\r\nAristotle's teachings with biblical theology, was the originator of the\r\nmethod adopted by schoolmen in the case of Aristotelian principles at\r\nvariance with their dogmas. Frederick II., the liberal emperor, employed\r\nJewish scholars and translators at his court; among them Jacob ben\r\nAbba-Mari ben Anatoli, to whom an annuity was paid for translating\r\nAristotelian works. Michael Scotus, the imperial astrologer, was his\r\nintimate friend. His contemporaries were chiefly popular philosophers or\r\nmystics, excepting only the prominent Provencal Jacob ben Machir, or\r\nProfatius Judaeus, as he was called, a member of the Tibbon family of\r\ntranslators. His observations on the inclination of the earth's axis\r\nwere used later by Copernicus as the basis of further investigations. He\r\nwas a famous teacher at the Montpellier academy, which reminds me to\r\nmention that Jews were prominently identified with the founding and the\r\nsuccess of the medical schools at Montpellier and Salerno, they, indeed,\r\nbeing almost the only physicians in all parts of the known world.\r\nSalerno, in turn, suggests Italy, where at that period translations were\r\nmade from Latin into Hebrew. Hillel ben Samuel, for instance, the same\r\nwho carried on a lively philosophic correspondence with another\r\ndistinguished Jew, Maestro Isaac Gayo, the pope's physician, translated\r\nsome of Thomas Aquinas's writings, Bruno di Lungoburgo's book on\r\nsurgery, and various other works, from Latin into Hebrew.\r\n\r\nThese successors of the great intellects of the golden age of\r\nneo-Hebraic literature, thoroughly conversant with Arabic literature,\r\nbusied themselves with rendering accessible to literary Europe the\r\ntreasury of Indian and Greek fables. Their translations and compilations\r\nhave peculiar value in the history of literary development. During the\r\nmiddle ages, when the memory of ancient literature had perished, they\r\nwere the means of preserving the romances, fairy tales, and fables that\r\nhave descended, by way of Spain and Arabia, from classical antiquity\r\nand the many-hued Oriental world to our modern literatures. Between the\r\neleventh and the thirteenth century, the foundations were laid for our\r\nnarrative literature, demonstrating the importance of delight in fable\r\nlore, stories of travel, and all sorts of narratives, for to it we owe\r\nthe creation of new and the transformation of old, literary forms.\r\n\r\nIn Germany at that time, a Jewish minnesinger and strolling minstrel,\r\nSuesskind von Trimberg, went up and down the land, from castle to castle,\r\nwith the poets' guild; while Santob di Carrion, a Jewish troubadour,\r\nventured to impart counsel and moral lessons to the Castilian king Don\r\nPedro before his assembled people. A century later, another Jew, Samson\r\nPnie, of Strasburg, lent his assistance to the two German poets at work\r\nupon the continuation of _Parzival_. The historians of German literature\r\nhave not laid sufficient stress upon the share of the Jews, heavily\r\noppressed and persecuted though they were, in the creation of national\r\nepics and romances of chivalry from the thirteenth to the fifteenth\r\ncentury. German Jews, being more than is generally recognized diligent\r\nreaders of the poets, were well acquainted with the drift of mediaeval\r\npoetry, and to this familiarity a new department of Jewish literature\r\nowed its rise and development. It is said that a Hebrew version of the\r\nArthurian cycle was made as early as the thirteenth century, and at the\r\nend of the period we run across epic poems on Bible characters, composed\r\nin the _Nibelungen_ metre, in imitation of old German legend lore and\r\nnational poetry.\r\n\r\nIf German Jews found heart for literary interests, it may be assumed as\r\na matter of course that Spanish and Provencal Jews participated in the\r\nadvancement of their respective national literatures and in Troubadour\r\npoetry. In these countries, too, the new taste for popular literature,\r\nespecially in the form of fables, was made to serve moral ends. A Jew,\r\nBerachya ben Natronai, was the precursor of Marie de France, the famous\r\nFrench fabulist, and La Fontaine and Lessing are indebted to him for\r\nsome of their material. As in the case of Aristotelian philosophy and of\r\nGreek and Arabic medical science, Jews assumed the role of mediators in\r\nthe transmission of fables. Indian fables reached their Arabic guise\r\neither directly or by way of Persian and Greek; thence they passed into\r\nHebrew and Latin translations, and through these last forms became the\r\nproperty of the European languages. For instance, the Hebrew translation\r\nof the old Sanskrit fox fables was the one of greatest service in\r\nliterary evolution. The translator of the fox fables is credited also\r\nwith the translation of the romance of \"The Seven Wise Masters,\" under\r\nthe title _Mishle Sandabar_. These two works gave the impetus to a great\r\nseries in Occidental literature, and it seems altogether probable that\r\nEurope's first acquaintance with them dates from their Hebrew\r\ntranslation.\r\n\r\nIn Arabic poetry, too, many a Jew deservedly attained to celebrity.\r\nAbraham ibn Sahl won such renown that the Arabs, notorious for\r\nparsimony, gave ten gold pieces for one of his songs. Other poets have\r\ncome down to us by name, and Joseph Ezobi, whom Reuchlin calls _Judaeorum\r\npoeta dulcissimus_, went so far as to extol Arabic beyond Hebrew poetry.\r\nHe was the first to pronounce the dictum famous in Buffon's repetition:\r\n\"The style is the man himself.\" Provence, the land of song, produced\r\nKalonymos ben Kalonymos (Maestro Calo), known to his brethren in faith\r\nnot only as a poet, but also as a scholar, whose Hebrew translations\r\nfrom the Arabic are of most important works on philosophy, medicine, and\r\nmathematics. As Anatoli had worked under Emperor Frederick II., so\r\nKalonymos was attached to Robert of Naples, patron of Jewish scholars.\r\nAt the same time with the Spanish and the German minstrel, there\r\nflourished in Rome Immanuel ben Solomon, the friend of Dante, upon whose\r\ndeath he wrote an Italian sonnet, and whose _Divina Commedia_ inspired a\r\npart of his poetical works also describing a visit to paradise and hell.\r\n\r\nWith the assiduous cultivation of romantic poetry, which was gradually\r\nusurping the place of moral romances and novels, grew the importance of\r\nOriental legends and traditions, so pregnant with literary suggestions.\r\nThis is attested by the use made of the Hebrew translation of Indian\r\nfables mentioned before, and of the famous collection of tales, the\r\n_Disciplina clericalis_ by the baptized Jew Petrus Alphonsus. The Jews\r\nnaturally introduced many of their own peculiar traditions, and thus can\r\nbe explained the presence of tales from the Talmud and the Midrash in\r\nour modern fairy tale books.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to note again that the Jews in turn submitted to the\r\ninfluence of foreign literatures. Immanuel Romi, for example, at his\r\nbest, is an exponent of Provencal versification and scholastic\r\nphilosophy, while his lapses testify to the self-complacency and levity\r\ncharacteristic of the times. Yehuda Romano, one of his contemporaries,\r\nis said to have been teacher to the king of Naples. He was the first Jew\r\nto attain to a critical appreciation of the vagaries of scholasticism,\r\nbut his claim to mention rests upon his translations from the Latin.\r\n\r\nAs Jews assisted at the birth of Arabic, French, and German, so they\r\nhave a share in the beginnings of Spanish, literature. Jews must be\r\ncredited with the first \"Chronicle of the Cid,\" with the romance, _Comte\r\nLyonnais, Palanus_, with the first collection of tales, the first chess\r\npoems, and the first troubadour songs. Again, the oldest collection of\r\nthe last into a _cancionera_ was made by the Jew Juan Alfonso de Baena.\r\n\r\nEven distant Persia has proofs to show of Jewish ability and energy in\r\nthose days. One Jew composed an epic on a biblical subject in the\r\nPersian language, another translated the Psalms into the vernacular.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent Jewish exponent of philosophy in this age of\r\nstrenuous interest in metaphysical speculations and contests was Levi\r\nben Gerson (Leon di Bannolas), theologian, scientist, physician, and\r\nastronomer. One of his ancestors, Gerson ben Solomon, had written a work\r\ntypical of the state of the natural sciences in his day. Levi ben\r\nGerson's chief work became famous not among Jews alone. It was referred\r\nto in words of praise by Pico della Mirandola, Reuchlin, Kepler, and\r\nother Christian thinkers. He was the inventor of an astronomical\r\ninstrument, a description of which was translated into Latin at the\r\nexpress command of Pope Clement VI., and carefully studied by Kepler.\r\nBesides, Levi ben Gerson was the author of an arithmetical work. In\r\nthose days, in fact up to the seventeenth century, there was but a faint\r\ndividing line between astronomy and mathematics, as between medicine and\r\nnatural history. John of Seville was a notable mathematician, the\r\ncompiler of a practical arithmetic, the first to make mention of decimal\r\nfractions, which possibly may have been his invention, and in the Zohar,\r\nthe text-book of mediaeval Jewish mysticism, which appeared centuries\r\nbefore Copernicus's time, the cause of the succession of day and night\r\nis stated to be the earth's revolution on its axis.\r\n\r\nIn this great translation period scarcely a single branch of human\r\nscience escaped the mental avidity of Jews. They found worthy of\r\ntranslation such essays as \"Rules for the Shoeing and Care of Horses in\r\nRoyal Stables\" and \"The Art of Carving and Serving at Princely Boards.\"\r\nTranslations of works on scholasticism now took rank beside those from\r\nGreek and Arabic philosophers, and to translations from the Arabic into\r\nHebrew were added translations from and into Latin, or even into the\r\nvernacular idiom wherever literary forms had developed. The bold\r\nassertion can be made good that not a single prominent work of ancient\r\nscience was left untranslated. On the other hand it is hard to speculate\r\nwhat would have been the fate of these treasures of antiquity without\r\nJewish intermediation. Doubtless an important factor in the work was the\r\nencouragement given Jewish scholars by enlightened rulers, such as\r\nEmperor Frederick II., Charles and Robert of Anjou, Jayme I. of Aragon,\r\nand Alfonso X. of Castile, and by popes, and private patrons of\r\nlearning. Mention has been made of Jewish contributions to the work of\r\nthe medical schools of Montpellier and Salerno. Under Jayme I. Christian\r\nand Jewish savants of Barcelona worked together harmoniously to promote\r\nthe cause of civilization and culture in their native land. The first to\r\nuse the Catalan dialect for literary purposes was the Jew Yehuda ben\r\nAstruc, and under Alfonso (X.) the Wise, Jews again attained to\r\nprominence in the king's favorite science of astronomy. The Alfonsine\r\nTables were chiefly the work of Isaac ibn Sid, a Toledo _chazan_\r\n(precentor). In general, the results reached by Jewish scholarship at\r\nAlfonso's court were of the utmost importance, having been largely\r\ninstrumental in establishing in the age of Tycho de Brahe and Kepler the\r\nfundamental principles of astronomy and a correct view of the orbits of\r\nthe heavenly bodies. Equal suggestiveness characterizes Jewish research\r\nin mathematics, a science to which, rising above the level of\r\nintermediaries and translators, Jews made original contributions of\r\nimportance, the first being Isaac Israeli's \"The Foundation of the\r\nUniverse.\" Basing his observations on Maimuni's and Abraham ben Chiya's\r\nstatement of the sphericity of the earth, Israeli showed that the\r\nheavenly bodies do not seem to occupy the place in which they would\r\nappear to an observer at the centre of the earth, and that the two\r\npositions differ by a certain angle, since known as parallax in the\r\nterminology of science. To Judah Hakohen, a scholar in correspondence\r\nwith Alfonso the Wise, is ascribed the arrangement of the stars in\r\nforty-eight constellations, and to another Jew, Esthori Hafarchi, we owe\r\nthe first topographical description of Palestine, whither he emigrated\r\nwhen the Jews were expelled from France by Philip the Fair.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the condition of the Jews, viewed from without and from\r\nwithin, had become most pitiable. The Kabbala lured into her charmed\r\ncircle the strongest Jewish minds. Scientific aspirations seemed\r\ncompletely extinguished. Even the study of the Talmud was abandoning\r\nsimple, undistorted methods of interpretation, and espousing the\r\nhairsplitting dialectics of the northern French school. Synagogue poetry\r\nwas languishing, and general culture found no votaries among Jews.\r\nOccasionally only the religious disputations between Jews and Christians\r\ninduced some few to court acquaintance with secular branches of\r\nlearning. In the fourteenth century Chasdai Crecas was the only\r\nphilosopher with an original system, which in its arguments on free\r\nwill and the nature of God anticipated the views of one greater than\r\nhimself, who, however, had a different purpose in view. That later and\r\ngreater philosopher, to whom the world is indebted for the evangel of\r\nmodern life, was likewise a Jew, a descendant of Spanish-Jewish\r\nfugitives. His name is Baruch Spinoza.\r\n\r\nHowever sad their fortunes, the literature of the Jews never entirely\r\neschewed the consideration of subjects of general interest. This\r\nreceives curious confirmation from the re-introduction of Solomon\r\nGabirol's peculiar views into Jewish religious philosophy, by way of\r\nChristian scholasticism, as formulated especially by Thomas Aquinas, the\r\n_Doctor angelicus_.\r\n\r\nThe Renaissance and the humanistic movement also reveal Jewish\r\ninfluences at work. The spirit of liberty abroad in the earth passed\r\nthrough the halls of Israel, clearing the path thenceforth to be trodden\r\nby men. Again the learned were compelled to engage the good offices of\r\nthe Jews, the custodians of biblical antiquity. The invention of the\r\nprinting press acted as a wonderful stimulus to the development of\r\nJewish literature. The first products of the new machine were Hebrew\r\nworks issued in Italy and Spain. Among the promoters of the Renaissance,\r\nand one of the most thorough students of religio-philosophical systems,\r\nwas Elias del Medigo, the friend of Pico della Mirandola, and the umpire\r\nchosen by the quarrelling factions in the University of Padua. John\r\nReuchlin, chief of the humanists, was taught Hebrew by Obadiah Sforno,\r\na _savant_ of profound scholarship, who dedicated his \"Commentary on\r\nEcclesiastes\" to Henry II. of France. Abraham de Balmes was a teacher at\r\nthe universities of Padua and Salerno, and physician in ordinary to\r\nCardinal Dominico Grimani. The Kabbala was made accessible to the heroes\r\nof the Renaissance by Jochanan Alemanno, of Mantua, and there is pathos\r\nin the urgency with which Reuchlin entreats Jacob Margoles, rabbi of\r\nNuremberg, to send him Kabbalistic writings in addition to those in his\r\npossession. Reuchlin's good offices to the Jews--his defense of them\r\nagainst the attacks of obscurantists--are a matter of general knowledge.\r\nAmong the teachers of the humanists who revealed to them the treasures\r\nof biblical literature the most prominent was Elias Levita, the\r\nintroducer, through his disciples Sebastian Muenster and Paul Fagius, of\r\nHebrew studies into Germany. He may be accounted a true humanist, a\r\ngenuine exponent of the Renaissance. His Jewish coadjutors were Judah\r\nAbrabanel (Leo Hebraeus), whose chief work was _Dialoghi di Amore_, an\r\nexposition of the Neoplatonism then current in Italy; Jacob Mantino,\r\nphysician to Pope Paul III.; Bonet di Lattes, known as a writer on\r\nastronomical subjects, and the inventor of an astronomical instrument;\r\nand a number of others.\r\n\r\nWhile in Italy the Spanish-Jewish exiles fell into line in the\r\nRenaissance movement, the large numbers of them that sought refuge in\r\nPortugal turned their attention chiefly to astronomical research and to\r\nvoyages of discovery and adventure, the national enterprises of their\r\nprotectors. Joao II. employed Jews in investigations tending to make\r\nreasonably safe the voyages, on trackless seas, under unknown skies, for\r\nthe discovery of long and ardently sought passages to distant lands. In\r\nhis commission charged with the construction of an instrument to\r\nindicate accurately the course of a vessel, the German knight Martin\r\nBehaim was assisted by Jews--astronomers, metaphysicians, and\r\nphysicians--chief among them Joseph Vecinho, distinguished for his part\r\nin the designing of the artificial globe, and Pedro di Carvallho,\r\nnavigator, whose claim to praise rests upon his improvement of Leib's\r\n_Astrologium_, and to censure, upon his abetment of the king when he\r\nrefused the request of the bold Genoese Columbus to fit out a squadron\r\nfor the discovery of wholly unknown lands. But when Columbus's plans\r\nfound long deferred realization in Spain, a Jewish youth, Luis de\r\nTorres, embarked among the ninety adventurers who accompanied him. Vasco\r\nda Gama likewise was aided in his search for a waterway to the Indies by\r\na Jew, the pilot Gaspar, the same who later set down in writing the\r\nscientific results of the voyage, and two Jews were despatched to\r\nexplore the coasts of the Red Sea and the island of Ormus in the Persian\r\nGulf. Again, Vasco da Gama's plans were in part made with the valuable\r\nassistance of a Jew, a profound scholar, Abraham Zacuto, sometime\r\nprofessor of astronomy at the University of Salamanca, and after the\r\nbanishment of Jews from Spain, astronomer and chronographer to Manuel\r\nthe Great, of Portugal. It was he that advised the king to send out Da\r\nGama's expedition, and from the first the explorer was supported by his\r\ncounsel and scientific knowledge.\r\n\r\nMeritorious achievements, all of them, but they did not shield the Jews\r\nagainst impending banishment. The exiles found asylums in Italy and\r\nHolland, and in each country they at once projected themselves into the\r\npredominant intellectual movement. A physician, Abraham Portaleone,\r\ndistinguished himself on the field of antiquarian research; another,\r\nDavid d'Ascoli, wrote a defense of Jews; and a third, David de Pomis, a\r\ndefense of Jewish physicians. The most famous was Amatus Lusitanus, one\r\nof whose important discoveries is said to have brought him close up to\r\nthat of the circulation of the blood. Before the banishment of Jews from\r\nSpain took effect, Antonio di Moro, a Jewish peddler of Cordova,\r\nflourished as the last of Spanish troubadours, and Rodrigo da Cota, a\r\nneo-Christian of Seville, as the first of Spanish dramatists, the\r\nsupposed author of _Celestina_, one of the most celebrated of old\r\nSpanish dramatic compositions.\r\n\r\nThe proscribed, in the guise of Marranos, and under the hospitable\r\nshelter of their new homes, could not be banished from literary Spain,\r\neven in its newest departures. Indeed, for a long time Spanish and\r\nItalian literatures were brought into contact with each other only\r\nthrough the instrumentality of Jews. Not quite half a century after the\r\nexpulsion of Jews from Portugal and their settlement in Italy, a Jew,\r\nSolomon Usque, made a Spanish translation of Petrarch (1567), dedicated\r\nto Alessandro Farnese, duke of Parma, and wrote Italian odes, dedicated\r\nto Cardinal Borromeo.\r\n\r\nAt the zenith of the Renaissance, Jews won renown as Italian poets, and\r\ndid valiant work as translators from Latin into Hebrew and Italian. In\r\nthe later days of the movement, in the Reformation period, illustrious\r\nChristian scholars studied Hebrew under Jewish tutorship, and gave it a\r\nplace on the curriculum of the universities. Luther himself submitted to\r\nrabbinical guidance in his biblical studies.\r\n\r\nIn great numbers the Spanish exiles turned to Turkey, where numerous new\r\ncommunities rapidly arose. There, too, in Constantinople and elsewhere,\r\nJews, like Elias Mizrachi and Elias Kapsali, were the first to pursue\r\nscientific research.\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the days of deepest misery for Judaism. Yet, in the\r\nface of unrelenting oppression, Jews win places of esteem as diplomats,\r\ncustodians and advocates of important interests at royal courts. From\r\nthe earliest period of their history, Jews manifested special talent for\r\nthe arts of diplomacy. In the Arabic-Spanish period they exercised great\r\npolitical influence upon Mohammedan caliphs. The Fatimide and Omayyad\r\ndynasties employed Jewish representatives and ministers, Samuel ibn\r\nNagdela, for instance, being grand vizir of the caliph of Granada.\r\nChristian sovereigns also valued their services: as is well known,\r\nCharlemagne sent a Jewish ambassador to Haroun al Rashid; Pope\r\nAlexander III. appointed Yechiel ben Abraham as minister of finance; and\r\nso late as in the fifteenth century the wise statesman Isaac Abrabanel\r\nwas minister to Alfonso V., of Portugal, and, wonderful to relate, for\r\neight years to Ferdinand and Isabella, of Spain. At this time Jewish\r\nliterature was blessed with a patron in the person of Joseph Nasi, duke\r\nof Naxos, whom, it is said, Sultan Selim II. wished to crown king of\r\nCyprus. His rival was Solomon Ashkenazi, Turkish ambassador to the\r\nVenetian republic, who exercised decisive influence upon the election of\r\na Polish king. And this is not the end of the roll of Jewish diplomats\r\nand ministers.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Kabbala, whose spell was cast about even the most\r\nvigorous of Jewish minds, was the leading intellectual current of those\r\nsad days, the prevailing misery but serving to render her allurements\r\nmore fascinating. But in the hands of such men as Abraham Herrera, who\r\ninfluenced Benedict Spinoza, even Kabbalistic studies were informed with\r\na scientific spirit, and brought into connection with Neoplatonic\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nMention of Spinoza suggests Holland where Jews were kindly received, and\r\nshortly after their arrival they interested themselves in the\r\nphilosophical pursuits in vogue. The best index to their position in\r\nHolland is furnished by Manasseh ben Israel's prominent role in the\r\npolitics and the literary ventures of Amsterdam, and by his negotiations\r\nwith Oliver Cromwell. We may pardon the pride which made him say, \"I\r\nhave enjoyed the friendship of the wisest and the best of Europe.\" Uriel\r\nAcosta and Baruch Spinoza, though children of the Amsterdam\r\n_Judengasse_, were ardent patriots.\r\n\r\nThe last great Spanish poet was Antonio Enrique de Gomez, the Jewish\r\nCalderon, burnt in effigy at Seville; while the last Portuguese poet of\r\nnote was Antonio Jose de Silva, who perished at the stake for his faith,\r\nleaving his dramas as a precious possession to Portuguese literature.\r\n\r\nEven in the dreariest days of decadence, when the study of the Talmud\r\nseemed to engross their attention, Jews prosecuted scientific inquiries,\r\nas witness Moses Isserles's translation of _Theorica_, an astronomical\r\ntreatise by Peurbach, the Vienna humanist.\r\n\r\nWith the migration of Jews eastward, _Judendeutsch_, a Jewish-German\r\ndialect, with its literature, was introduced into Slavic countries. It\r\nis a fact not generally known that this jargon is the depository of\r\ncertain Middle High German expressions and elements no longer used in\r\nthe modern German, and that philologists are forced to resort to the\r\nstudy of the Polish-Jewish patois to reconstruct the old idiom. In 1523,\r\nthe year of Luther's Pentateuch translation, a Jewish-German Bible\r\ndictionary was published at Cracow, and in 1540 appeared the first\r\nJewish-German translation of the Pentateuch. The Germans strongly\r\ninfluenced the popular literature of the Jews. The two nationalities\r\nseized the same subjects, often imitating the same models, or using the\r\nsame translations. The German \"Till Eulenspiegel\" was printed in 1500,\r\nthe Jewish-German in 1600. Besides incorporating German folklore,\r\nJewish-German writings borrowed from German romances, assimilated\r\nforeign literatures, did not neglect the traditions of the Jews\r\nthemselves, and embraced even folk-songs, some of which have perpetuated\r\nthemselves until the modern era.\r\n\r\nMention of the well-known fact that the Hebrew studies prosecuted by\r\nChristians in the eighteenth century were carried on under Jewish\r\ninfluence brings us to the threshold of the modern era, the period of\r\nthe Jewish Renaissance. Here we are on well-worn ground. Since Jews have\r\nbeen permitted to enter at will upon the multifarious pursuits growing\r\nout of modern culture, their importance as factors of civilization is\r\nuniversally acknowledged, and it would be wearisome, and would far\r\ntransgress the limits of a lecture, to enumerate their achievements.\r\n\r\nIn trying to show what share the Jew has had in the world's\r\ncivilization, I have naturally concerned myself chiefly with literature,\r\nfor literature is the mirror of culture. It would be a mistake, however,\r\nto suppose that the Jew has been inactive in other spheres. His\r\ncontributions, for instance, to the modern development of international\r\ncommerce, cannot be overlooked. Commerce in its modern extension was the\r\ncreation of the mercantile republics of mediaeval Italy-Venice, Florence,\r\nGenoa, and Pisa--and in them Jews determined and regulated its course.\r\nWhen Ravenna contemplated a union with Venice, and formulated the\r\nconditions for the alliance, one of them was the demand that rich Jews\r\nbe sent thither to open a bank for the relief of distress. Jews were the\r\nfirst to obtain the privilege of establishing banks in the Italian\r\ncities, and the first to discover the advantages of a system of checks\r\nand bills of exchange, of unique value in the development of modern\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nEven in art, a sphere from which their rigorous laws might seem to have\r\nthe effect of banishing them, they were not wholly inactive. They always\r\nnumbered among themselves handicraftsmen. In Venice, in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, we find celebrated Jewish wood engravers. Jacob Weil's rules\r\nfor slaughtering were published with vignettes by Hans Holbein, and one\r\nof Manasseh ben Israel's works was adorned with a frontispiece by\r\nRembrandt. In our own generation Jews have won fame as painters and\r\nsculptors, while music has been their staunch companion, deserting them\r\nnot even in the darkest days of the Ghetto.\r\n\r\nThese certainly are abundant proofs that the Jew has a share in all the\r\nphases and stages of culture, from its first germs unto its latest\r\ncomplex development--a consoling, elevating reflection. A learned\r\nhistorian of literature, a Christian, in discussing this subject, was\r\nprompted to say: \"Our first knowledge of philosophy, botany, astronomy,\r\nand cosmography, as well as the grammar of the holy language and the\r\nresults of biblical study, we owe primarily to Jews.\" Another historian,\r\nalso a Christian, closes a review of Jewish national traits with the\r\nwords: \"Looking back over the course of history, we find that in the\r\ngloom, bareness, and intellectual sloth of the middle ages, Jews\r\nmaintained a rational system of agriculture, and built up international\r\ncommerce, upon which rests the well-being of the nations.\"\r\n\r\nTruly, there are reasons for pride on our part, but no less do great\r\nobligations devolve upon us. I cannot refrain from exhortation. In\r\njustice we should confess that Jews drew their love of learning and\r\nability to advance the work of civilization from Jewish writings.\r\nFurthermore, it is a fact that these Jewish writings no longer excite\r\nthe interest, or claim the devotion of Jews. I maintain that it is the\r\nduty of the members of our Order to take this neglected, lightly\r\nesteemed literature under their protection, and secure for it the\r\nappreciation and encouragement that are the offspring of knowledge.\r\n\r\nModern Judaism presents a curious spectacle. The tiniest of national\r\ngroups in Eastern Europe, conceiving the idea of establishing its\r\nindependence, proceeds forthwith to create a literature, if need be,\r\ninventing and forging. Judaism possesses countless treasures of\r\ninestimable worth, amassed by research and experience in the course of\r\nthousands of years, and her latter-day children brush them aside with\r\nindifference, even with scorn, leaving it to the sons of the stranger,\r\nyea, their adversaries, to gather and cherish them.\r\n\r\nWhen Goethe in his old age conceived and outlined a scheme of universal\r\nliterature, the first place was assigned to Jewish literature. In his\r\npantheon of the world's poetry, the first tone uttered was to be that\r\nof \"David's royal song and harp.\" But, in general, Jewish literature is\r\nstill looked upon as the Cinderella of the world's literatures. Surely,\r\nthe day will come when justice will be done, Cinderella's claim be\r\nacknowledged equal to that of her royal sisters, and together they will\r\nenter the spacious halls of the magnificent palace of literature.\r\n\r\nAmong the prayers prescribed for the Day of Atonement is one of\r\nsubordinate importance which affects me most solemnly. When the shadows\r\nof evening lengthen, and the light of the sun wanes, the Jew reads the\r\n_Neilah_ service with fervor, as though he would \"burst open the portals\r\nof heaven with his tears,\" and the inmost depths of my nature are\r\nstirred with melancholy pride by the prayer of the pious Jew. He\r\nsupplicates not for his house and his family, not for Zion dismantled,\r\nnot for the restoration of the Temple, not for the advent of the\r\nMessiah, not for respite from suffering. All his sighs and hopes, all\r\nhis yearning and aspiration, are concentrated in the one thought: \"Our\r\nsplendor and our glory have departed, our treasures have been snatched\r\nfrom us; there remains nothing to us but this Law alone.\" If this is\r\ntrue; if naught else is left of our former state; if this Law, this\r\nscience, this literature, are our sole treasure and best inheritance,\r\nthen let us cherish and cultivate them so as to have a legacy to\r\nbequeath to our children to stand them in good stead against the coming\r\nof the _Neilah_ of humanity, the day when brethren will \"dwell together\r\nin unity.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps that day is not far distant. Methinks I hear the rustling of a\r\nnew spring-tide of humanity; methinks I discern the morning flush of new\r\nworld-stirring ideas, and before my mind's eye rises a bridge, over\r\nwhich pass all the nations of the earth, Israel in their midst, holding\r\naloft his ensign with the inscription, \"The Lord is my banner!\"--the one\r\nwhich he bore on every battlefield of thought, and which was never\r\nsuffered to fall into the enemy's hand. It is a mighty procession moving\r\nonward and upward to a glorious goal: \"Humanity, Liberty, Love!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMEN IN JEWISH LITERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the songs of the Bible there are two, belonging to the oldest\r\nmonuments of poetry, which have preserved the power to inspire and\r\nelevate as when they were first uttered: the hymn of praise and\r\nthanksgiving sung by Moses and his sister Miriam, and the impassioned\r\nsong of Deborah, the heroine in Israel.\r\n\r\nMiriam and Deborah are the first Israelitish women whose melody thrilled\r\nand even now thrills us--Miriam, the inspired prophetess, pouring forth\r\nher people's joy and sorrow, and Deborah, _Esheth Lapidoth_, the Bible\r\ncalls her, \"the woman of the flaming heart,\" an old writer ingeniously\r\ninterprets the Scriptural name. They are the chosen exemplars of all\r\nwomen who, stepping across the narrow confines of home, have lifted up a\r\nvoice, or wielded a pen, for Israel. The time is not yet when woman in\r\nliterature can be discussed without an introductory justification. The\r\nprejudice is still deep-rooted which insists that domestic activity is\r\nwoman's only legitimate career, that to enter the literary arena is\r\nunwomanly, that inspired songs may drop only from male lips. Woman's\r\nheart should, indeed, be the abode of the angels of gentleness, modesty,\r\nkindness, and patience. But no contradiction is involved in the belief\r\nthat her mind is endowed with force and ability on occasion to grasp the\r\nspokes of fortune's wheel, or produce works which need not shrink from\r\npublic criticism. Deborah herself felt that it would have better become\r\na man to fulfil the mission with which she was charged--that a cozy home\r\nhad been a more seemly place for her than the camp upon Mount Tabor. She\r\nsays: \"Desolate were the open towns in Israel, they were desolate....\r\nWas there a shield seen or a spear among forty thousand in Israel?...\r\nI--unto the Lord will I sing.\" Not until the fields of Israel were\r\ndesert, forsaken of able-bodied men, did the woman Deborah arise for the\r\nglory of God. She refused to pose as a heroine, rejected the crown of\r\nvictory, nor coveted the poet's laurel, meet recognition of her\r\ntriumphal song. Modestly she chose the simplest yet most beautiful of\r\nnames. She summoned the warriors to battle; the word of God was\r\nproclaimed by her lips; she pronounced judgment, and right prevailed;\r\nher courage sustained her on the battlefield, and victory followed in\r\nher footsteps--yet neither judge, nor poetess, nor singer, nor\r\nprophetess will she call herself, but only _Em beyisrael_, \"a mother in\r\nIsrael.\"\r\n\r\nThis heroine, this \"mother in Israel,\" in all the wanderings and\r\nvicissitudes of the Jewish people, was the exemplar of its women and\r\nmaidens, the especial model of Israelitish poetesses and writers.\r\n\r\nThe student of Jewish literature is like an astronomer. While the casual\r\nobserver faintly discerns single stars dotted in the expanse of blue\r\noverhead, he takes in the whole sweep of the heavens, readily following\r\nthe movements of the stars of every magnitude. The history of the Jewish\r\nrace, its mere preservation during the long drawn out period of\r\nsuffering--sad days of national dissolution and sombre middle age\r\ncenturies--is a perplexing puzzle, unless regarded with the eye of\r\nfaith. But that this race, cuffed, crushed, pursued, hounded from spot\r\nto spot, should have given birth to men, yea, even women ranking high in\r\nthe realm of letters, is wholly inexplicable, unless the explanation of\r\nthe unique phenomenon is sought in the wondrous gift of inspiration\r\noperative in Israel even after the last seer ceased to speak.\r\n\r\nJudaism has preserved the Jews! Judaism, that is, the Law with its\r\ndevelopment and ramifications of a great religious thought, was the\r\nsustaining power of the Jewish people under its burden of misery,\r\nsuffering, torture, and oppression, enabling it to survive its\r\ntormentors. The Jews were the nation of hope. Like hope this people is\r\neternal. The storms of fanaticism and race hatred may rage and roar, the\r\nrace cannot be destroyed. Precisely in the days of its abject\r\ndegradation, when its suffering was dire, how marvellous the conduct of\r\nthis people! The conquered were greater than their conquerors. From\r\ntheir spiritual height they looked down compassionately on their\r\nvictorious but ignorant adversaries, who, feeling the condescension of\r\nthe victims, drove their irons deeper. The little nation grew only the\r\nstronger, and its religion, the flower of hope and trust, developed the\r\nmore sturdily for its icy covering. Jews were mowed down by fire and\r\nsword, but Judaism continued to live. From the ashes of every pyre\r\nsprang the Jewish Law in unfading youth--that indestructible,\r\nineradicable mentality and hope, which opponents are wont to call\r\nunconquerable Jewish defiance.\r\n\r\nThe men of this great little race were preserved by the Law, the spirit,\r\nand the influences and effects of this same Law transformed weak women\r\ninto God-inspired martyrs, dowered the daughters of Israel with courage\r\nto sacrifice life for the glory of the God-idea confessed by their\r\nancestors during thousands of years. Purity of morals, confiding\r\ndomesticity, were the safeguards against storm and stress. The outside\r\nworld presented a hostile front to the Jew of the middle ages. Every\r\nstep beyond Ghetto precincts was beset with peril. So his home became\r\nhis world, his sanctuary, in whose intimate seclusion the blossom of\r\npure family love unfolded. While spiritual darkness brooded over the\r\nnations, the great Messianic God-idea took refuge from the icy chill of\r\nthe middle ages in his humble rooms, where it was cherished against the\r\ncoming of a glorious future.\r\n\r\n\"Every Jew has the making of a Messiah in him,\" says a clever modern\r\nauthor,[25] \"and every Jewess of a _mater dolorosa_,\" of which the first\r\npart is only an epigram, the second, a truth, an historic fact.\r\nMediaeval Judaism knew many \"sorrowful mothers,\" whose heroism passes\r\nour latter-day conception. Greece and Rome tell tales upon tales of\r\nwomanly bravery under suffering and pain--Jewish history buries in\r\nsilence the names of its thousands of woman and maiden martyrs, joyously\r\ngiving up life in the vindication of their faith. Perhaps, had one woman\r\nbeen too weak to resist, too cowardly to court and embrace death, her\r\nname might have been preserved. Such, too, fail to appear in the Jewish\r\nannals, which contain but few women's names of any kind. Inspired\r\ndevotion of strength and life to Judaism was as natural with a Jewess as\r\nquiet, unostentatious activity in her home. No need, therefore, to make\r\nmention of act or name.\r\n\r\nJewish woman, then, has neither found, nor sought, and does not need, a\r\nFrauenlob, historian or poet, to proclaim her praise in the gates, to\r\ntouch the strings of his lyre in her honor. Her life, in its simplicity\r\nand gentleness, its patience and exalted devotion, is itself a Song of\r\nSongs, more beautiful than poet ever composed, a hymn more joyous than\r\nany ever sung, on the prophetess's sublime and touching text, _Em\r\nbeyisrael_, \"a mother in Israel.\"\r\n\r\nAs Miriam and Deborah are representative of womanhood during Israel's\r\nnational life, so later times, the Talmudic periods, produced women with\r\ngreat and admirable qualities. Prominent among them was Beruriah, the\r\ngentle wife of Rabbi Meir, the Beruriah whose heart is laid bare in the\r\nfollowing touching story from the Talmud:[26]\r\n\r\nOne Sabbath her husband had been in the academy all day teaching the\r\ncrowds that eagerly flocked to his lectures. During his absence from\r\nhome, his two sons, distinguished for beauty and learning, died suddenly\r\nof a malignant disease. Beruriah bore the dear bodies into her sleeping\r\nchamber, and spread a white cloth over them. When the rabbi returned in\r\nthe evening, and asked for his boys that, according to wont, he might\r\nbless them, his wife said, \"They have gone to the house of God.\"\r\n\r\nShe brought the wine-cup, and he recited the concluding prayer of the\r\nSabbath, drinking from the cup, and, in obedience to a hallowed custom,\r\npassing it to his wife. Again he asked, \"Why are my sons not here to\r\ndrink from the blessed cup?\" \"They cannot be far off,\" answered the\r\npatient sufferer, and suspecting naught, Rabbi Meir was happy and\r\ncheerful. When he had finished his meal, Beruriah said: \"Rabbi, allow me\r\nto ask you a question.\" With his permission, she continued: \"Some time\r\nago a treasure was entrusted to me, and now the owner demands it. Shall\r\nI give it up?\" \"Surely, my wife should not find it necessary to ask this\r\nquestion,\" said the rabbi. \"Can you hesitate about returning property to\r\nits rightful owner?\" \"True,\" she replied, \"but I thought best not to\r\nreturn it until I had advised you thereof.\" And she led him into the\r\nchamber to the bed, and withdrew the cloth from the bodies. \"O, my sons,\r\nmy sons,\" lamented the father with a loud voice, \"light of my eyes, lamp\r\nof my soul. I was your father, but you taught me the Law.\" Her eyes\r\nsuffused with tears, Beruriah seized her grief-stricken husband's hand,\r\nand spoke: \"Rabbi, did you not teach me to return without reluctance\r\nthat which has been entrusted to our safekeeping? See, 'the Lord gave,\r\nand the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.'\"\r\n\"'Blessed be the name of the Lord,'\" repeated the rabbi, accepting her\r\nconsolation, \"and blessed, too, be His name for your sake; for, it is\r\nwritten: 'Who can find a virtuous woman? for far above pearls is her\r\nvalue.... She openeth her mouth with wisdom, and the law of kindness is\r\nupon her tongue.'\"\r\n\r\nSurrounded by the halo of motherhood, richly dowered with intellectual\r\ngifts, distinguished for learning, gentleness, and refinement, Beruriah\r\nis a truly poetic figure. Incensed at the evil-doing of the unrighteous,\r\nher husband prayed for their destruction. \"How can you ask that, Rabbi?\"\r\nBeruriah interrupted him; \"do not the Scriptures say: 'May _sins_ cease\r\nfrom off the earth, and the wicked will be no more'? When _sin_ ceases,\r\nthere will be no more _sinners_. Pray rather, my rabbi, that they\r\nrepent, and amend their ways.\"[27]\r\n\r\nThat a woman could attain to Beruriah's mental poise, and make her voice\r\nheard and heeded in the councils of the teachers of the Law, and that\r\nthe rabbis considered her sayings and doings worthy of record, would of\r\nitself, without the evidence of numerous other learned women of Talmud\r\nfame, prove, were proof necessary, the honorable position occupied by\r\nJewish women in those days. Long before Schiller, the Talmud said:[28]\r\n\"Honor women, because they bring blessing.\" Of Abraham it is said: \"It\r\nwas well with him, because of his wife Sarah.\" Again: \"More glorious is\r\nthe promise made to women, than that to men: In Isaiah (xxxii. 9) we\r\nread: 'Ye women that are at ease, hear my voice!' for, with women it\r\nlies to inspire their husbands and sons with zeal for the study of the\r\nLaw, the most meritorious of deeds.\" Everywhere the Talmud sounds the\r\npraise of the virtuous woman of Proverbs and of the blessings of a happy\r\nfamily life.\r\n\r\nA single Talmudic sentence, namely, \"He who teaches his daughter the\r\nLaw, teaches her what is unworthy,\" torn from its context, and falsely\r\ninterpreted, has given rise to most absurd theories with regard to the\r\nviews of Talmudic times on the matter of woman's education. It should be\r\ntaken into consideration that its author, who is responsible also for\r\nthe sentiment that \"woman's place is at the distaff,\" was the husband of\r\nIma Shalom, a clever, highly cultured, but irascible woman, who was on\r\nintimate terms with Jewish Christians, and was wont to interfere in the\r\ndisputations carried on by men--in short, a representative Talmudic\r\nblue-stocking, with all the attributes with which fancy would be prone\r\nto invest such a one.[29]\r\n\r\nElsewhere the Talmud tells about Rabbi Nachman's wife Yaltha, the proud\r\nand learned daughter of a princely line. Her guest, the poor itinerant\r\npreacher Rabbi Ulla, expressed the opinion that according to the Law it\r\nwas not necessary to pass the wine-cup over which the blessing has been\r\nsaid to women. The opinion, surely not the withheld wine, so angered his\r\nhostess, that she shivered four hundred wine-pitchers, letting their\r\ncontents flow over the ground.[30] If the rabbis had such incidents in\r\nmind, crabbed utterances were not unjustifiable. Perhaps every\r\nrabbinical antagonist to woman's higher education was himself the victim\r\nof a learned wife, who regaled him, after his toilsome research at the\r\nacademy, with unpalatable soup, or, worse still, with Talmudic\r\ndiscussions. Instances are abundant of erudite rabbis tormented by their\r\nwives. One, we are told, refused to cook for her husband, and another,\r\nday after day, prepared a certain dish, knowing that he would not touch\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut this is pleasantry. It would betray total ignorance of the Talmud\r\nand the rabbis to impute to them the scorn of woman prevalent at that\r\ntime. The Talmud and its sages never weary of singing the praise of\r\nwomen, and at every occasion inculcate respect for them, and devotion to\r\ntheir service. The compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud, Rabbi Jochanan,\r\nwhose life is crowned with the aureole of romance, pays a delicate\r\ntribute to woman by the question: \"Who directed the first prayer of\r\nthanksgiving to God? A woman, Leah, when she cried out in the fulness of\r\nher joy: 'Now again will I praise the Lord.'\"\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of such ideal views, and in obedience to such\r\nstandards, Jewish woman led a modest, retired life of domestic activity,\r\nthe help-meet and solace of her husband, the joy of his age, the\r\ntreasure of his liberty, his comforter in sorrow. For, when the\r\nportentous catastrophe overwhelmed the Jewish nation, when Jerusalem and\r\nthe Temple lay in ruins, when the noblest of the people were slain, and\r\nthe remnant of Israel was made to wander forth out of his land into a\r\nhostile world, to fulfil his mission as a witness to the truth of\r\nmonotheism, then Jewish woman, too, was found ready to assume the\r\nburdens imposed by distressful days.\r\n\r\nIsrael, broken up into unresisting fragments, began his two thousand\r\nyears' journey through the desert of time, despoiled of all possessions\r\nexcept his Law and his family. Of these treasures Titus and his legions\r\ncould not rob him. From the ruins of the Jewish state blossomed forth\r\nthe spirit of Jewish life and law in vigorous renewal. Judaism rose\r\nrejuvenated on the crumbling temples of Jupiter, immaculate in doctrine,\r\nincorruptible in practice. Israel's spiritual guides realized that\r\nadherence to the Law is the only safeguard against annihilation and\r\noblivion. From that time forth, the men became the guardians of the\r\n_Law_, the women the guardians of the purity of _life_, both working\r\nharmoniously for the preservation of Judaism.\r\n\r\nThe muse of history recorded no names of Jewish women from the\r\ndestruction of the Temple to the eleventh century. Yet the student\r\ncannot fail to assign the remarkable preservation of the race to\r\nwoman's gentle, quiet, though paramount influence by the side of the\r\nearnest tenacity of men. Among Jews leisure, among non-Jews knowledge,\r\nwas lacking to preserve names for the instruction of posterity. Before\r\nJews could record their suffering, the oppressor's hand again fell, its\r\ngrasp more relentless than ever. For many centuries blood and tears\r\nconstitute the chronicle of Jewish life, and at the sources of these\r\nstreams of blood and rivers of tears, the genius of Jewish history sits\r\nlamenting.\r\n\r\nWhenever the sun of tolerance broke through the clouds of oppression,\r\nand for even a brief period shone upon the martyr race, its marvellous\r\ndevelopment under persecution and in despite of unspeakable suffering at\r\nonce stood revealed. During these occasional breaks in the darkness,\r\nwomen appeared whose erudition was so profound as to earn special\r\nmention. As was said above, the first names of women distinguished for\r\nbeauty and intellect come down to us from the eleventh century, and even\r\nthen only Italy, Provence, Andalusia, and the Orient, were favored, Jews\r\nin these countries living unmolested and in comparative freedom, and\r\nzealously devoting their leisure to the study of the Talmud and secular\r\nbranches of learning. In praise of Italy it was said: \"Out of Bari goes\r\nforth the Law, and the word of the Lord from Otranto.\" It is, therefore,\r\nnot surprising to read in Jewish sources of the maiden Paula, of the\r\nfamily Dei Mansi (Anawim), the daughter of Abraham, and later the wife\r\nof Yechiel dei Mansi, who, in 1288, copied her father's abstruse\r\nTalmudic commentary, adding ingenious explanations, the result of\r\nindependent research. But one grows somewhat sceptical over the account,\r\nby a Jewish tourist, Rabbi Petachya of Ratisbon, of Bath Halevi,\r\ndaughter of Rabbi Samuel ben Ali in Bagdad, equally well-read in the\r\nBible and the Talmud, and famous for her beauty. She lectured on the\r\nTalmud to a large number of students, and, to prevent their falling in\r\nlove with her, she sat behind lattice-work or in a glass cabinet, that\r\nshe might be heard but not seen. The dry tourist-chronicler fails to\r\nreport whether her disciples approved of the preventive measure, and\r\nwhether in the end it turned out to have been effectual. At all events,\r\nthe example of the learned maiden found an imitator. Almost a century\r\nlater we meet with Miriam Shapiro, of Constance, a beautiful Jewish\r\ngirl, who likewise delivered public lectures on the Talmud sitting\r\nbehind a curtain, that the attention of her inquisitive pupils might not\r\nbe distracted by sight of her from their studies.\r\n\r\nOf the learned El Muallima we are told that she transplanted Karaite\r\ndoctrines from the Orient to Castile, where she propagated them. The\r\ndaughter of the prince of poets, Yehuda Halevi, is accredited with a\r\nsoulful religious poem hitherto attributed to her father, and Rabbi\r\nJoseph ibn Nagdela's wife was esteemed the most learned and\r\nrepresentative woman in Granada. Even in the choir of Arabic-Andalusian\r\npoets we hear the voice of a Jewish songstress, Kasmune, the daughter\r\nof the poet Ishmael. Only a few blossoms of her delicate poetry have\r\nbeen preserved.[31] Catching sight of her young face in the mirror, she\r\ncalled out:\r\n\r\n    \"A vine I see, and though 'tis time to glean,\r\n      No hand is yet stretched forth to cull the fruit.\r\n    Alas! my youth doth pass in sorrow keen,\r\n      A nameless 'him' my eyes in vain salute.\"\r\n\r\nHer pet gazelle, raised by herself, she addresses thus:\r\n\r\n    \"In only thee, my timid, fleet gazelle,\r\n      Dark-eyed like thee, I see my counterpart;\r\n    We both live lone, without companion dwell,\r\n      Accepting fate's decree with patient heart.\"\r\n\r\nOf other women we are told whose learning and piety inspired respect,\r\nnot only in Talmudic authorities, but, more than that, in their sisters\r\nin faith. Especially in the family of Rashi (Rabbi Solomon ben Isaac),\r\nimmortal through his commentaries on the Bible and the Talmud, a number\r\nof women distinguished themselves. His daughter Rachel (Bellejeune), on\r\none occasion when her father was sick, wrote out for Rabbi Abraham Cohen\r\nof Mayence an opinion on religious questions in dispute. Rashi's two\r\ngranddaughters, Anna and Miriam, were equally famous. In questions\r\nrelating to the dietary laws, they were cited as authorities, and their\r\ndecisions accepted as final.\r\n\r\nZunz calls the wife of Rabbi Joseph ben Jochanan of Paris \"almost a\r\nrabbi\"; and Dolce, wife of the learned Rabbi Eleazar of Worms, supported\r\nher family with the work of her hands, was a thorough student of the\r\ndietary laws, taught women on Jewish subjects, and on Sabbath delivered\r\npublic lectures. She wore the twofold crown of learning and martyrdom.\r\nOn December 6, 1213, fanatic crusaders rushed into the rabbi's house,\r\nand most cruelly killed her and her two daughters, Bella and Anna.\r\n\r\nIsrael having again fallen on evil times, the rarity of women writers\r\nduring the next two centuries needs no explanation. In the sixteenth\r\ncentury their names reappear on the records, not only as Talmudic\r\nscholars, but also as writers of history in the German language. Litte\r\nof Ratisbon composed a history of King David in the celebrated \"Book of\r\nSamuel,\" a poem in the _Nibelungen_ stanza, and we are told that Rachel\r\nAckermann of Vienna was banished for having written a piquant novel,\r\n\"Court Secrets.\"\r\n\r\nThese tentative efforts led the way to busy and widespread activity by\r\nJewish women in various branches of literature at a somewhat later\r\nperiod, when the so-called _Judendeutsch_, also known as\r\n_Altweiberdeutsch_ (old women's German), came into general use. Rebekah\r\nTiktiner, daughter of Rabbi Meir Tiktiner, attained to a reputation\r\nconsiderable enough to suggest her scholarly work to J. G. Zeltner, a\r\nRostock professor, as the subject of an essay published in 1719. Her\r\nbook, _Meneketh Ribka_, deals with the duties of woman. Edel Mendels of\r\nCracow epitomized \"Yosippon\" (History of the Jews after Josephus); Bella\r\nChasan, who died a martyr's death, composed two instructive works on\r\nJewish history, in their time widely read; Glikel Hamel of Hamburg wrote\r\nher memoirs, describing her contemporaries and the remarkable events of\r\nher life; Hannah Ashkenasi was the author of addresses on moral\r\nsubjects; and Ella Goetz translated the Hebrew prayers into\r\nJewish-German.\r\n\r\nLitte of Ratisbon found imitators. Rosa Fischels of Cracow was the first\r\nto put the psalms into Jewish-German rhymes (1586). She turned the whole\r\npsalter \"into simple German very prettily, modestly, and withal\r\npleasantly for women and maidens to read.\" The authoress acknowledges\r\nthat it was her aim to imitate the rhyme and melody of the \"Book of\r\nSamuel\" by her famed predecessor. Occasionally her paraphrase rises to\r\nthe height of true poetry, as in the first and last verses of Psalm\r\nxcvi:\r\n\r\n\"Sing to God a new song, sing to God all the land, sing to God, praise\r\nHis name, show forth His ready help from day to day.... The field and\r\nall thereon shall show great joy; they will sing with all their leaves,\r\nthe trees of the wood and the grove, before the Lord God who will come\r\nto judge the earth far and near. He judgeth the earth with righteousness\r\nand the nations with truth.\"\r\n\r\nRosa Fischels was followed by a succession of women writers: Taube Pan\r\nin Prague, a poetess; Bella Hurwitz, who wrote a history of the House\r\nof David, and, in association with Rachel Rausnitz, an account of the\r\nsettlement of Jews in Prague; and a number of scholarly women famous\r\namong their co-religionists for knowledge of the Talmud, piety, and\r\nbroad, secular culture.\r\n\r\nIn a rapid review like this of woman's achievements on the field of\r\nJewish scholarship, the results recorded must appear meagre, owing\r\npartly to the paucity of available data, partly to the nature of the\r\ninquiry. Abstruse learning, pure science, original research, are by no\r\nmeans woman's portion. Such occupations demand complete surrender on the\r\npart of the student, uninterrupted attention to the subject pursued, and\r\ndelicately organized woman is not capable of such absorption. Woman's\r\nperceptions are subtle, and she rests satisfied with her intuitions;\r\nwhile man strives to transmute his feelings, deeper than hers, into\r\naction. The external appeals to woman who comprehends easily and\r\nquickly, and, therefore, does not penetrate beneath the surface. Man, on\r\nthe other hand, strives to pierce to the essence of things, apprehends\r\nmore slowly, but thinks more profoundly, and tests carefully before he\r\naccepts. Hence we so rarely meet woman in the field of science, while\r\nher work in the domain of poetry and the humanities is abundant and\r\nattractive. Jewish women form no exception to the rule: a survey of\r\nJewish poetry will show woman's share in its productions to have been\r\nconsiderable and of high quality. While there was little or no\r\npossibility to prosecute historic or scientific inquiry during the\r\nharrowing days of persecution, the well-spring of Jewish poetry never\r\nran dry. Poetry followed the race into exile, and clave to it through\r\nall vicissitudes, its solacement in suffering, the holy mediatrix\r\nbetween its past and future. \"The Orient dwells an exile in the\r\nOccident, and its tears of longing for home are the fountain-head of\r\nJewish poetry,\" says a Christian scholar. And at the altar of this\r\npoetry, whose sweetness and purity sanctified home life, and spread a\r\nsense of morality in a time when brutality and corruptness were general,\r\nthe women singers of Israel offered the gifts of their muse. While the\r\nculture of that time culminated in the service of love (_Minnedienst_),\r\nin woman worship, so offensive to modern taste, Jewish poetry was\r\npervaded by a pure, ideal conception of love and womanhood, testifying\r\nto the high ethical principles of its devotees.\r\n\r\nJudaism and Jewish poetry know naught of the sensual love so assiduously\r\nfostered by the cult of the Virgin. \"Love,\" says a celebrated historian\r\nof literature, \"was glorified in all shapes and guises, and represented\r\nas the highest aim of life. Woman's virtues, yea, even her vices, were\r\ninvested with exaggerated importance. Woman became accustomed to think\r\nthat she could be neither faithful nor faithless without turning the\r\nworld topsy-turvy. She shared the fate of all objects of excessive\r\nadulation: flattery corrupted her. Thus it came about that love of woman\r\novershadowed every other social force and every form of family\r\naffection, and so spent its power. The Jews were the only ones sane\r\nenough to subordinate sexual love to reverence for motherhood. Alexander\r\nWeill makes a Jewish mother say: 'Is it proper for a good Jewish mother\r\nto concern herself about love? Love is revolting idolatry. A Jewess may\r\nlove only God, her husband, and her children.' Granny (_Alt-Babele_) in\r\none of Kompert's tales says: 'God could not be everywhere, so he created\r\nmothers.' In Jewish novels, maternal love is made the basis of family\r\nlife, its passion and its mystery. A Jewish mother! What an image the\r\nwords conjure up! Her face is calm, though pale; a melancholy smile\r\nrests upon her lips, and her soulful eyes seem to hide in their depths\r\nthe vision of a remote future.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a correct view. Jewish poetry is interpenetrated with the breath\r\nof intellectual love, that is, love growing out of the recognition of\r\nduty, no less ideal than sensual love. In the heart of the Jew love is\r\nan infinite force. Too mighty to be confined to the narrow limits of\r\npersonal passion, it extends so as to include future generations.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that while in Christian poetry woman was the subject of\r\nsong and sonnet, in Jewish poetry she herself sang and composed, and her\r\nproductions are worthy of ranking beside the best poetic creations of\r\neach generation.\r\n\r\nThe earliest blossoms of Jewish poetry by women unfolded in the\r\nspring-like atmosphere of the Renaissance under the blue sky of Italy,\r\nthe home of the immortal trio, Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio. The\r\nfirst Jewish women writers of Italian verse were Deborah Ascarelli and\r\nSara Copia Sullam, who, arrayed in the full panoply of the culture of\r\ntheir day, and as thoroughly equipped with Jewish knowledge, devoted\r\ntheir talents and their zeal to the service of their nation.\r\n\r\nDeborah Ascarelli of Rome, the pride of her sex, was the wife of the\r\nrespected rabbi Giuseppe Ascarelli, and lived at Venice in the beginning\r\nof the seventeenth century. She made a graceful Italian translation of\r\nMoses Rieti's _Sefer ha-Hechal_, a Hebrew poem written in imitation of\r\nthe _Divina Commedia_, and enjoying much favor at Rome. As early as\r\n1609, David della Rocca published a second edition of her translation,\r\ndedicating it to the charming authoress. To put the highly wrought,\r\nartificial poetry of the Hebrew Dante into mellifluous Italian verse was\r\nby no means easy. While Rieti's poetry is not distinguished by the vigor\r\nand fulness of the older classical productions of neo-Hebraic poetry,\r\nhis rhythm is smooth, pleasant, and polished. Yet her rendition is\r\nadmirable. Besides, she won fame as a writer of hymns in praise of the\r\nGod of her people, who so wondrously rescued it from all manner of\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\n    \"Let other poets of victory's trophies tell,\r\n    Thy song will e'er thy people's praises swell,\"\r\n\r\nsays a Jewish Italian poet enchanted by her talent.\r\n\r\nA still more gifted poetess was Sara Copia Sullam, a particular star in\r\nJudah's galaxy.[32] The only child of a wealthy Venetian at the end of\r\nthe sixteenth century, she was indulged in her love of study, and\r\nafforded every opportunity to advance in the arts and sciences. \"She\r\nrevelled in the realm of beauty, and crystallized her enthusiasm in\r\ngraceful, sweet, maidenly verses. Young, lovely, of generous impulses\r\nand keen intellectual powers, her ambition set upon lofty attainments, a\r\nfavorite of the muses, Sara Copia charmed youth and age.\"\r\n\r\nThese graces of mind became her misfortune. An old Italian priest,\r\nAnsaldo Ceba, in Genoa, published an Italian epic with the Esther of the\r\nBible as the heroine. Sara was delighted with the choice of the subject.\r\nIt was natural that a high-minded, sensitive girl with lofty ideals,\r\nstung to the quick by the injustice and contumely suffered by her\r\npeople, should rejoice extravagantly in the praise lavished upon a\r\nheroine of her nation. Carried away by enthusiasm she wrote the poet, a\r\nstranger to her, a letter overflowing with gratitude for the pure\r\ndelight his poem had yielded her. Her passionate warmth, betraying at\r\nonce the accomplished poetess and the gifted thinker, did not fail to\r\nfascinate the old priest, who immediately resolved to capture this\r\nbeautiful soul for the church. His desire brought about a lively\r\ncorrespondence, our chief source of information about Sara Copia. Her\r\nconversion became a passion with the highstrung priest, taking complete\r\npossession of him during the last years of his life. He brought to bear\r\nupon her case every trick of dialectics and flattery at his command. All\r\nin vain. The greatest successes of which he could boast were her promise\r\nto read the New Testament, and her consent to his praying for her\r\nconversion. Sara's arguments in favor of Judaism arouse the reader's\r\nadmiration for the sharpness of intellect displayed, her poetic genius,\r\nand her intimate acquaintance with Jewish sources as well as philosophic\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nAnsaldo never abandoned the hope of gaining her over to Christianity.\r\nUnable to convince her reason, he attacked her heart. Though evincing\r\nsingular love and veneration for her old admirer, Sara could not be\r\nmoved from steadfast adherence to her faith. She sent him her picture\r\nwith the words: \"This is the picture of one who carries yours deeply\r\ngraven on her heart, and, with finger pointing to her bosom, tells the\r\nworld: 'Here dwells my idol, bow before him.'\"\r\n\r\nWith old age creeping upon him with its palsy touch, he continued to\r\nthink of nothing but Sara's conversion, and assailed her in prose and\r\nverse. One of his imploring letters closes thus:\r\n\r\n    \"Life's fair, bright morn bathes thee in light,\r\n      Thy cheeks are softly flushed with youthful zest.\r\n    For me the night sets in; my limbs\r\n      Are cold, but ardent love glows in my breast.\"\r\n\r\nSara having compared his poems with those of Amphion and Orpheus, he\r\nanswered her:\r\n\r\n    \"To Amphion the stones lent ear\r\n      When soft he touched his lute;\r\n    And beasts came trooping nigh to hear\r\n      When Orpheus played his flute.\r\n\r\n    How long, O Sara, wilt thou liken me\r\n      To those great singers of the olden days?\r\n    My God and faith I sought to give to thee,\r\n      In vain I proved the error of thy ways.\r\n    Their song had charms more potent than my own,\r\n    Or art thou harder than a beast or stone?\"\r\n\r\nThe query long remained unanswered, for just then the poetess was\r\nharassed by many trials. Serious illness prostrated her, then her\r\nbeloved father died, and finally she was unjustly charged by the envious\r\namong her co-religionists with neglect of Jewish observances, and denial\r\nof the divine origin of the Law. She found no difficulty in refuting the\r\nmalicious accusation, but she was stung to the quick by the calumnious\r\nattack, the pain it inflicted vanishing only in the presence of a grave\r\ndanger. Balthasar Bonifacio, an obscure author, in a brochure published\r\nfor that purpose, accused her of rejecting the doctrine of the\r\nimmortality of the soul, a most serious charge, which, if sustained,\r\nwould have thrown her into the clutches of the Inquisition. In two days\r\nshe wrote a brilliant defense completely exonerating herself and\r\nexposing the spitefulness of the attack, a masterful production by\r\nreason of its vigorous dialectics, incisive satire, and noble enthusiasm\r\nfor the cause of religion. Together with some few of her sonnets, this\r\nis all that has come down to us of her writings. She opened her\r\nvindication with the following sonnet:\r\n\r\n    \"O Lord, Thou know'st my inmost hope and thought,\r\n      Thou know'st whene'er before Thy judgment throne\r\n      I shed salt tears, and uttered many a moan,\r\n    'Twas not for vanities that I besought.\r\n    O turn on me Thy look with mercy fraught,\r\n      And see how envious malice makes me groan!\r\n      The pall upon my heart by error thrown\r\n    Remove; illume me with Thy radiant thought.\r\n      At truth let not the wicked scorner mock,\r\n      O Thou, that breath'dst in me a spark divine.\r\n      The lying tongue's deceit with silence blight,\r\n      Protect me from its venom, Thou, my Rock,\r\n      And show the spiteful sland'rer by this sign\r\n      That Thou dost shield me with Thy endless might.\"\r\n\r\nSara's vindication was complete. Her friend Ceba was kept faithfully\r\ninformed of all that befell her, but he was absorbed in thoughts of her\r\nconversion and his approaching end. He wrote to her that he did not care\r\nto receive any more letters from her unless they announced her\r\nacceptance of the true faith.\r\n\r\nAfter Ansaldo's death, we hear nothing more about the poetess. She died\r\nat the beginning of 1641, and the celebrated rabbi, Leon de Modena,\r\ncomposed her epitaph, a poetic tribute to one whose life redounded to\r\nthe glory of Judaism.\r\n\r\nOur subject now carries us from the luxuriant south to the dunes of the\r\nNorth Sea. Holland was the first to open the doors of its cities\r\nhospitably to the three hundred thousand Jews exiled from Spain, and its\r\nbusy capital Amsterdam became the centre whither tended the intelligent\r\nof the Marranos, fleeing before the Holy Inquisition. Physicians,\r\nmathematicians, philologists, military men, and diplomats, poets and\r\npoetesses, took refuge there. Among the poetesses,[33] the most\r\nprominent was Isabella Correa, distinguished for wit as well as poetic\r\nendowment, the wife of the Jewish captain and author, Nicolas de Oliver\r\ny Fullano, of Majorca. One of her contemporaries, Daniel de Barrios,\r\nsays that \"she was an accomplished linguist, wrote delightful letters,\r\ncomposed exquisite verses, played the lute like a _maestro_, and sang\r\nlike an angel. Her sparkling black eyes sent piercing darts into every\r\nbeholder's heart, and she was famed for beauty as well as intellect.\"\r\nShe made a noble Spanish translation of _Pastor Fido_, the most popular\r\nItalian drama of the day, and published a volume of poems, also in\r\nSpanish. Antonio dos Reys sings her praises:\r\n\r\n  \"_Pastor Fido!_ no longer art thou read in thy own tongue, since Correa,\r\n  Faithfully rendering thy song, created thee anew in Spanish forms.\r\n  A laurel wreath surmounts her brow,\r\n  Because her right hand had cunning to strike tones from the tragic lyre.\r\n  On the mount of singers, a seat is reserved for her,\r\n  Albeit many a Batavian voice refused consent.\r\n  For, Correa's faith invited scorn from aliens,\r\n  And her own despised her cheerful serenity.\r\n  Now, with greater justice, all bend a reverent knee to Correa, the Jewess,\r\n  Correa, who, it seems, is wholly like Lysia.\"\r\n\r\nDonna Isabella Enriquez, a Spanish poetess of great versatility, was her\r\ncontemporary. She lived first in Madrid, afterwards in Amsterdam, and\r\neven in advanced age was surrounded by admirers. At the age of\r\nsixty-two, she presented the men of her acquaintance with amulets\r\nagainst love, notwithstanding that she had spoken and written against\r\nthe use of charms. For instance, when an egg with a crown on the end was\r\nfound in the house of Isaac Aboab, the celebrated rabbi at Amsterdam,\r\nshe wrote him the following:\r\n\r\n    \"See, the terror! Lo! the wonder!\r\n    Basilisk, the fabled viper!\r\n    Superstition names it so.\r\n    Look at it, I pray, with calmness,\r\n    'Twas thy mind that was at fault.\r\n    God's great goodness is displayed here;\r\n    He, I trow, rewards thy eloquence\r\n    In the monster which thou seest:\r\n    All this rounded whole's thy virtue,\r\n    Wisdom's symbol is the crown!\"\r\n\r\nBesides Isabella Correa and Isabella Enriquez, we have the names, though\r\nnot the productions, of Sara de Fonseca Pina y Pimentel, Bienvenida\r\nCohen Belmonte, and Manuela Nunes de Almeida. They have left but faint\r\ntraces of their work, and fancy can fill in the sketch only with\r\nconjectures.\r\n\r\nAfter these Marrano poetesses, silence fell upon the women of Israel for\r\na whole century--a century of oppression and political slavery, of\r\nisolation in noisome Ghettos, of Christian scorn and mockery. The Jews\r\nof Germany and Poland, completely crushed beneath the load of sorrow,\r\nhibernated until the gentle breath of a new time, levelling Ghetto walls\r\nand heralding a dawn when human rights would be recognized, awoke them\r\nto activity and achievement.\r\n\r\nMighty is the spirit of the times! It clears a way for itself, boldly\r\npushing aside every stumbling-block in the shape of outworn prejudices\r\nand decaying customs. A century dawned, the promise of liberty and\r\ntolerance flaming on its horizon, to none so sweet as to the Jew. Who\r\nhas the heart to cast the first stone upon a much-tried race, tortured\r\nthroughout the centuries, for surrendering itself to the unwonted joy of\r\nliving, for drinking deep, intoxicating draughts from the newly\r\ndiscovered fount of liberty, and, alas! for throwing aside, under the\r\nburning sun of the new era, the perennial protection of its religion?\r\nAnd may we utterly condemn the daughters of Israel, the \"roses of\r\nSharon,\" and \"lilies of the valleys,\" \"unkissed by the dew, lost\r\nwanderers cheered by no greeting,\" who, now that all was sunshine,\r\nforgot their people, and disregarded the sanctity of family bonds, their\r\nshield and their refuge in the sorrow and peril of the dark ages?\r\n\r\nWith emotion, with pain, not with resentment, Jewish history tells of\r\nthose women, who spurned Judaism, knowing only its external appearance,\r\nits husk, not its essence, high ethical principles and philosophical\r\ntruths--of Rahel Varnhagen, Henriette Herz, Regina Froehlich, Dorothea\r\nMendelssohn, Sarah and Marianne Meyer, Esther Gad, and many others,\r\nfirst products of German culture in alliance with Jewish wit and\r\nbrilliancy.\r\n\r\nRahel Levin was the foster-mother of \"Young Germany,\" and leader in the\r\nwoman's emancipation movement, so fruitful later on of deplorable\r\nexcesses. Rahel herself never overstepped the limits of \"_das\r\nEwig-Weibliche_.\" No act of hers ran counter to the most exalted\r\nrequirements of morality. Her being was pervaded by high seriousness,\r\nnoble dignity, serene cheerfulness. \"She dwelt always in the Holy of\r\nholies of thought, and even her most daring wishes for herself and\r\nmankind leapt shyly heavenwards like pure sacrificial flames.\" Nothing\r\nmore touching can be found in the history of the human heart than her\r\nconfession before death: \"With sublime rapture I dwell upon my origin\r\nand the marvellous web woven by fate, binding together the oldest\r\nrecollections of the human race and its most recent aspirations,\r\nconnecting scenes separated by the greatest possible intervals of time\r\nand space. My Jewish birth which I long considered a stigma, a sore\r\ndisgrace, has now become a precious inheritance, of which nothing on\r\nearth can deprive me.\"[34]\r\n\r\nThe fact is that Rahel Levin was a great woman, great even in her\r\naberrations, while her satellites, shining by reflected light, and\r\npretending to perpetuate her spirit, transgressed the bounds of\r\nwomanliness, and opened wide a door to riotous sensuality. Certain\r\nopponents of the woman's emancipation movement take malicious\r\nsatisfaction in rehearsing that it was a Jewess who inaugurated it,\r\nprudently neglecting to mention that in the list of Rahel's followers,\r\nnot one Jewish name appears.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of Judaism and with it the spirit of morality can never be\r\nextinguished. They may flag, or vanish for a time, but their restoration\r\nin increased vigor and radiance is certain; for, they bear within\r\nthemselves the guarantee of a future. Henriette Herz, the apostate\r\ndaughter of Judaism chewing the cud of Schleiermacher's sentimentality\r\nand Schlegel's romanticism, had not yet passed away when England\r\nproduced Jewish women whose deeds were quickened by the spirit of olden\r\nheroism, who walked in the paths of wisdom and faith, and, recoiling\r\nfrom the cowardice that counsels apostasy, would have fought, if need\r\nbe, suffered, and bled, for their faith. What answer but the blush of\r\nshame mantling her cheek could the proud beauty have found, had she been\r\nasked by, let us say, Lady Judith Montefiore, to tell what it was that\r\nchained her to the ruins of the Jewish race?\r\n\r\nLady Montefiore truly was a heroine, worthy to be named with those who\r\nhave made our past illustrious, and her peer in intellect and strength\r\nof character was Charlotte Montefiore, whose early death was a serious\r\nloss to Judaism as well as to her family. Her work, \"A Few Words to the\r\nJews by one of themselves,\" containing that charming tale, \"The Jewel\r\nIsland,\" displays intellectual and poetic gifts.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent of women writers in our era unquestionably is Grace\r\nAguilar, in whom we must admire the rare union of broad culture and\r\nprofound piety. She was born at Hackney in June of 1816, and early\r\nshowed extraordinary talent and insatiable thirst for knowledge. In her\r\ntwelfth year she wrote \"Gustavus Vasa,\" an historical drama evincing\r\nsuch unusual gifts that her parents were induced to devote themselves\r\nexclusively to her education. It is a charming picture this, of a young,\r\ngifted girl, under the loving care of cultured parents actuated by the\r\nsole desire to imbue their daughter with their own taste for natural and\r\nartistic beauty and their steadfast love for Judaism, and content to\r\nlead a modest existence, away from the bustle and the opportunities of\r\nthe city, in order to be able to give themselves up wholly to the\r\neducation and companionship of their beloved, only daughter. Under the\r\ninfluence of a wise friend, Grace Aguilar herself tells us, she\r\nsupplicated God to enable her to do something by which her people might\r\ngain higher esteem with their Christian fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nGod hearkened unto her prayer, for her efforts were crowned with\r\nsuccess. Her first work was the translation of a book from the Hebrew,\r\n\"Israel Defended.\" Next came \"The Magic Wreath,\" a collection of poems,\r\nand then her well-known works, \"Home Influence,\" \"The Spirit of\r\nJudaism,\" her best production, \"The Women of Israel,\" \"The Jewish\r\nFaith,\" and \"History of the Jews in England\"--a rich harvest for one\r\nwhose span of life was short. Her pen was dipped into the blood of her\r\nveins and the sap of her nerves; the sacred fire of the prophets burnt\r\nin her soul, and she was inspired by olden Jewish enthusiasm and\r\ndevotion to a trust.\r\n\r\nSo ardent a spirit could not long be imprisoned within so frail a body.\r\nIn the very prime of life, just thirty-one years old, Grace Aguilar\r\npassed away, as though her beautiful soul were hastening to shake off\r\nthe mortal coil. She rests in German earth, in the Frankfort Jewish\r\ncemetery. Her grave is marked with a simple stone, bearing an equally\r\nsimple epitaph:\r\n\r\n    \"Give her of the fruit of her hands,\r\n    And let her own works praise her in the gates.\"\r\n\r\nHer death was deeply lamented far and wide. She was a golden link in the\r\nchain of humanity--a bold, courageous, withal thoroughly womanly woman,\r\na God-inspired daughter of her race and faith. \"We are persuaded,\" says\r\na non-Jewish friend of hers, \"that had this young woman lived in the\r\ntimes of frightful persecution, she would willingly have mounted the\r\nstake for her faith, praying for her murderers with her last breath.\"\r\nThat the nobility of a solitary woman, leaping like a flame from heart\r\nto heart, may inspire high-minded thoughts, and that Grace Aguilar's\r\nlife became a blessing for her people and for humanity, is illustrated\r\nby the following testimonial signed by several hundred Jewish women,\r\npresented to her when she was about to leave England:\r\n\r\n\"Dearest Sister--Our admiration of your talents, our veneration for your\r\ncharacter, our gratitude for the eminent services your writings render\r\nour sex, our people, our faith, in which the sacred cause of true\r\nreligion is embodied: all these motives combine to induce us to intrude\r\non your presence, in order to give utterance to sentiments which we are\r\nhappy to feel and delighted to express. Until you arose, it has, in\r\nmodern times, never been the case that a Woman in Israel should stand\r\nforth the public advocate of the faith of Israel; that with the depth\r\nand purity of feelings which is the treasure of woman, and with the\r\nstrength of mind and extensive knowledge that form the pride of man, she\r\nshould call on her own to cherish, on others to respect, the truth as it\r\nis in Israel.\r\n\r\n\"You, dearest Sister, have done this, and more. You have taught us to\r\nknow and appreciate our dignity; to feel and to prove that no female\r\ncharacter can be ... more pure than that of the Jewish maiden, none more\r\npious than that of the woman in Israel. You have vindicated our social\r\nand spiritual equality with our brethren in the faith: you have, by your\r\nown excellent example, triumphantly refuted the aspersion, that the\r\nJewish religion leaves unmoved the heart of the Jewish woman. Your\r\nwritings place within our reach those higher motives, those holier\r\nconsolations, which flow from the spirituality of our religion, which\r\nurge the soul to commune with its Maker and direct it to His grace and\r\nHis mercy as the best guide and protector here and hereafter....\"\r\n\r\nHer example fell like seed upon fertile soil, for Abigail Lindo, Marian\r\nHartog, Annette Salomon, and especially Anna Maria Goldsmid, a writer of\r\nmerit, daughter of the well-known Sir Isaac Lyon Goldsmid, may be\r\nconsidered her disciples, the fruit of her sowing.\r\n\r\nThe Italian poetess, Rachel Morpurgo, a worthy successor of Deborah\r\nAscarelli and Sara Copia Sullam, was contemporaneous with Grace Aguilar,\r\nthough her senior by twenty-six years. Our interest in her is heightened\r\nby her use of the Hebrew language, which she handled with such\r\nconsummate skill that her writings easily take rank with the best of\r\nneo-Hebraic literature. A niece of the famous scholar S. D. Luzzatto,\r\nshe was born at Triest, April 8, 1790. Until the age of twelve she\r\nstudied the Bible, then she read Bechai's \"Duties of the Heart\" and\r\nRashi's commentary, and from her fourteenth to her sixteenth year she\r\ndevoted herself to the Talmud and the Zohar--a remarkable course of\r\nstudy, pursued, too, in despite of adverse circumstances. At the same\r\ntime she was taught the turner's art by Luzzatto's father, and later she\r\nlearned tailoring. One of her poems having been published without her\r\nknowledge, she gives vent to her regret in a sonnet:\r\n\r\n    \"My soul surcharged with grief now loud complains,\r\n      And fears upon my spirit heavily weigh.\r\n      'Thy poem we have heard,' the people say,\r\n    'Who like to thee can sing melodious strains?'\r\n    'They're naught but sparks,' outspeaks my soul in chains,\r\n      'Struck from my life by torture every day.\r\n      But now all perfume's fled--no more my lay\r\n    Shall rise; for, fear of shame my song restrains.'\r\n      A woman's fancies lightly roam, and weave\r\n      Themselves into a fairy web. Should I\r\n      Refrain? Ah! soon enough this pleasure, too,\r\n      Will flee! Verily I cannot conceive\r\n      Why I'm extolled. For woman 'tis to ply\r\n      The spinning wheel--then to herself she's true.\"\r\n\r\nThis painful self-consciousness, coupled with the oppression of material\r\ncares, forms the sad refrain of Rachel Morpurgo's writings. She is a\r\ntrue poetess: the woes of humanity are reflected in her own sorrows, to\r\nwhich she gave utterance in soulful tones. She, too, became an exemplar\r\nfor a number of young women. A Pole, Yenta Wohllerner, like Rachel\r\nMorpurgo, had to propitiate churlish circumstances before she could\r\npublish the gifts of her muse, and Miriam Mosessohn, Bertha Rabbinowicz,\r\nand others, emulated her masterly handling of the Hebrew language.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the new era was marked by the appearance of a triad of\r\nJewesses--Grace Aguilar in England, Rachel Morpurgo in Italy, and\r\nHenriette Ottenheimer in Germany. A native of the blessed land of\r\nSuabia, Henriette Ottenheimer was consecrated to poetry by intercourse\r\nwith two masters of song--Uhland and Rueckert. Her poems, fragrant\r\nblossoms plucked on Suabian fields, for the most part are no more than\r\nsweet womanly lyrics, growing strong with the force of enthusiasm only\r\nwhen she dwells upon her people's sacred mission and the heroes of Bible\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nWomen like these renew the olden fame of the Jewess, and add\r\nachievements to her brilliant record. As for their successors and\r\nimitators, our contemporaries, whose literary productions are before us,\r\non them we may not yet pass judgment; their work is still on probation.\r\n\r\nOne striking circumstance in connection with their activity should be\r\npointed out, because it goes to prove the soundness of judgment, the\r\npenetration, and expansiveness characteristic of Jews. While the\r\nmovement for woman's complete emancipation has counted not a single\r\nJewess among its promoters, its more legitimate successor, the movement\r\nto establish woman's right and ability to earn a livelihood in any\r\nbranch of human endeavor--a right and ability denied only by prejudice,\r\nor stupidity--was headed and zealously supported by Jewesses, an\r\nassertion which can readily be proved by such names as Lina Morgenstern,\r\nknown to the public also as an advocate of moderate religious reforms,\r\nJenny Hirsch, Henriette Goldschmidt, and a number of writers on subjects\r\nof general and Jewish interest, such as Rachel Meyer, Elise Levi\r\n(Henle), Ulla Frank-Wolff, Johanna Goldschmidt, Caroline Deutsch, in\r\nGermany; Rebekah Eugenie Foa, Julianna and Pauline Bloch, in France;\r\nEstelle and Maria Hertzveld, in Holland, and Emma Lazarus, in America.\r\n\r\nOne other name should be recorded. Fanny Neuda, the writer of \"Hours of\r\nDevotion,\" and a number of juvenile stories, has a double claim upon our\r\nrecognition, inasmuch as she is an authoress of the Jewish race who has\r\naddressed her writings exclusively to Jewish women.\r\n\r\nWe have followed Jewish women from the days of their first flight into\r\nthe realm of song through a period of two thousand years up to modern\r\ntimes, when our record would seem to come to a natural conclusion. But I\r\ndeem it proper to bring to your attention a set of circumstances which\r\nwould be called phenomenal, were it not, as we all know, that the\r\ngreatest of all wonders is that true wonders are so common.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact, spread by literary journals, that the\r\nRothschild family, conspicuous for financial ability, has produced a\r\ngoodly number of authoresses. But it is less well known, and much more\r\nnoteworthy, that many of the excellent women of this family have devoted\r\ntheir literary gifts and attainments to the service of Judaism. The\r\npalaces of the Rothschilds, the richest family in the world, harbor many\r\na warm heart, whose pulsations are quickened by the thought of Israel's\r\nhistory and poetic heritage. Wealth has not abated a jot of their\r\nenthusiasm and loyal love for the faith. The first of the house of\r\nRothschild to make a name for herself as an authoress was Lady\r\nCharlotte Rothschild, in London, one of the noblest women of our time,\r\nwho, standing in the glare of prosperity, did not disdain to take up the\r\ncudgels in defense of her people, to go Sabbath after Sabbath to her\r\npoor, unfortunate sisters in faith, and expound to them, in the school\r\nestablished by her generosity, the nature and duties of a moral,\r\nreligious life, in lectures pervaded by the spirit of truth and faith.\r\nTwo volumes of these addresses have been published in German and English\r\n(1864 and 1869), and every page gives evidence of rare piety,\r\nconsiderable scholarship, thorough knowledge of the Bible, and a high\r\ndegree of culture. Equal enthusiasm for Judaism pervades the two volumes\r\nof \"Thoughts Suggested by Bible Texts\" (1859), by Baroness Louise,\r\nanother of the English Rothschilds.\r\n\r\nThree young women of this house, in which wealth is not hostile to\r\nidealism, have distinguished themselves as writers, foremost among them\r\nClementine Rothschild, a gentle, sweet maiden, claimed by death before\r\nlife with its storms could rob her of the pure ideals of youth. She died\r\nin her twentieth year, and her legacy to her family and her faith is\r\ncontained in \"Letters to a Christian Friend on the Fundamental Truths of\r\nJudaism,\" abundantly worthy of the perusal of all women, regardless of\r\ncreed. This young woman displayed more courage, more enthusiasm, more\r\nwit, to be sure also more precise knowledge of Judaism, than thousands\r\nof men of our time, young and old, who fancy grandiloquent periods\r\nsufficient to solve the great religious problems perplexing mankind.\r\n\r\nFinally, mention must be made of Constance and Anna de Rothschild, whose\r\ntwo volume \"History and Literature of the Israelites\" (1872) created a\r\nveritable sensation, and awakened the literary world to the fact that\r\nthe Rothschild family is distinguished not only for wealth, but also for\r\nthe talent and religious zeal of its authoresses.\r\n\r\nI have ventured to group these women of the Rothschild family together\r\nas a conclusion to the history of Jewish women in literature, because I\r\ntake their work to be an earnest of future accomplishment. Such examples\r\ncannot fail to kindle the spark of enthusiasm slumbering in the hearts\r\nof Jewish women, and the sacred flame of religious zeal, tended once\r\nmore by women, will leap from rank to rank in the Jewish army. As it is,\r\na half-century has brought about a remarkable change in feeling towards\r\nJudaism. Fifty years ago the following lines by Caroline Deutsch, one of\r\nthe above-mentioned modern German writers, could not have awakened the\r\nsame responsive chord as now:\r\n\r\n    \"Little cruet in the Temple\r\n      That didst feed the sacrificial flame,\r\n    What a true expressive symbol\r\n      Art thou of my race, of Israel's fame!\r\n    Thou for days the oil didst furnish\r\n      To illume the Temple won from foe--\r\n    So for centuries in my people\r\n      Spirit of resistance ne'er burnt low.\r\n    It was cast from home and country,\r\n      Gloom and sorrow were its daily lot;\r\n    Yet the torch of faith gleamed steady,\r\n      Courage, like thy oil, forsook it not.\r\n    Mocks and jeers were all its portion,\r\n      Death assailed it in ten thousand forms--\r\n    Yet this people never faltered,\r\n      Hope, its beacon, led it through all storms.\r\n    Poorer than dumb, driven cattle,\r\n      It went forth enslaved from its estate,\r\n    All its footsore wand'rings lighted\r\n      By its consciousness of worth innate.\r\n    Luckless fortunes could not bend it;\r\n      Unjust laws increased its wondrous faith;\r\n    From its heart exhaustless streaming,\r\n      Freedom's light shone on its thorny path.\r\n    Oil that burnt in olden Temple,\r\n      Eight days only didst thou give forth light!\r\n    Oil of faith sustained this people\r\n      Through the centuries of darkest night!\"\r\n\r\nWe can afford to look forward to the future of Judaism serenely. The\r\nsigns of the times seem propitious to him whose eye is clear to read\r\nthem, whose heart not too embittered to understand their message aright.\r\n\r\nOur rough and tumble time, delighting in negation and destruction,\r\ncrushing underfoot the tender blossoms of poetry and faith, living up to\r\nits quasi motto, \"What will not die of itself, must be put to death,\"\r\nwill suddenly come to a stop in its mad career of annihilation. That\r\nwill mark the dawn of a new era, the first stirrings of a new\r\nspring-tide for storm-driven Israel. On the ruins will rise the Jewish\r\nhome, based on Israel's world-saving conception of family life, which,\r\nhaving enlightened the nations of the earth, will return to the source\r\nwhence it first issued. Built on this foundation, and resting on the\r\npillars of modern culture, Jewish spirit, and true morality, the Jewish\r\nhome will once more invite the nations to exclaim: \"How beautiful are\r\nthy tents, O Jacob, thy dwellings, O Israel!\"\r\n\r\nMay the soft starlight of woman's high ideals continue to gleam on the\r\nthorny path of the thinker Israel; may they never depart from Israel,\r\nthose God-kissed women that draw inspiration at the sacred fount of\r\npoesy, and are consecrated by its limpid waters to give praise and\r\nthanksgiving to Him that reigns on high; may the poet's words ever\r\nremain applicable to the matrons and maidens of Israel:[35]\r\n\r\n    \"Pure woman stands in life's turmoil\r\n      A rose in leafy bower;\r\n    Her aspirations and her toil\r\n      Are tinted like a flower.\r\n\r\n    Her thoughts are pious, kind, and true,\r\n      In evil have no part;\r\n    A glimpse of empyrean blue\r\n      Is seen within her heart.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOSES MAIMONIDES\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Who is Maimonides? For my part, I confess that I have merely heard the\r\nname.\" This naive admission was not long since made by a well-known\r\nFrench writer in discussing the subject of a prize-essay, \"Upon the\r\nPhilosophy of Maimonides,\" announced by the _academie universitaire_ of\r\nParis. What short memories the French have for the names of foreign\r\nscholars! When the proposed subject was submitted to the French minister\r\nof instruction, he probably asked himself the same question; but he was\r\nnot at a loss for an answer; he simply substituted Spinoza for\r\nMaimonides. To be sure, Spinoza's philosophy is somewhat better known\r\nthan that of Maimonides. But why should a minister of instruction take\r\nthat into consideration? The minister and the author--both presumably\r\nover twenty-five years of age--might have heard this very question\r\npropounded and answered some years before. They might have known that\r\ntheir colleague Victor Cousin, to save Descartes from the disgrace of\r\nhaving stood sponsor to Spinozism, had established a far-fetched\r\nconnection between the Dutch philosopher and the Spanish, pronouncing\r\nSpinoza the devoted disciple of Maimonides. Perhaps they might have been\r\nexpected to know, too, that Solomon Munk, through his French\r\ntranslation of Maimonides' last work, had made it possible for modern\r\nthinkers to approach the Jewish philosopher, and that soon after this\r\ntranslation was published, E. Saisset had written an article upon Jewish\r\nphilosophy in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, in which he gave a popular\r\nand detailed exposition of Maimonides' religious views. All this they\r\ndid not know, and, had they known it, they surely would not have been so\r\ncandid as the German thinker, Heinrich Ritter, who, in his \"History of\r\nChristian Philosophy,\" frankly admits: \"My impression was that mediaeval\r\nphilosophy was not indebted to Jewish metaphysicians for any original\r\nline of thought, but M. Munk's discovery convinced me of my\r\nmistake.\"[36]\r\n\r\nWho was Maimonides? The question is certainly more justifiable upon\r\nGerman than upon French soil. In France, attention has been invited to\r\nhis works, while in Germany, save in the circle of the learned, he is\r\nalmost unknown. Even among Jews, who call him \"Rambam,\" he is celebrated\r\nrather than known. It seems, then, that it may not be unprofitable to\r\npresent an outline of the life and works of this philosopher of the\r\nmiddle ages, whom scholars have sought to connect with Spinoza, with\r\nLeibnitz, and even with Kant.[37]\r\n\r\nWhile readers in general possess but little information about Maimonides\r\nhimself, the period in which he lived, and which derives much of its\r\nbrilliancy and importance from him, is well known, and has come to be a\r\nfavorite subject with modern writers. That period was a very dreamland\r\nof culture. Under enlightened caliphs, the Arabs in Spain developed a\r\ncivilization which, during the whole of the middle ages up to the\r\nRenaissance, exercised pregnant influence upon every department of human\r\nknowledge. A dreamland, in truth, it appears to be, when we reflect that\r\nthe descendants of a highly cultured people, the teachers of Europe in\r\nmany sciences, are now wandering in African wilds, nomads, who know of\r\nthe glories of their past only through a confused legend, holding out to\r\nthem the extravagant hope that the banner of the Prophet may again wave\r\nfrom the cathedral of Granada. Yet this Spanish-Arabic period bequeathed\r\nto us such magnificent tokens of architectural skill, of scientific\r\nresearch, and of philosophic thought, that far from regarding it as\r\nfancy's dream, we know it to be one of the corner-stones of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nProminent among the great men of this period was the Jew Moses ben\r\nMaimon, or as he was called in Arabic, Abu Amran Musa ibn Maimun Obaid\r\nAllah (1135-1204). It may be said that he represented the full measure\r\nof the scientific attainments of the age at the close of which he\r\nstood--an age whose culture comprised the whole circle of sciences then\r\nknown, and whose conscious goal was the reconciliation of religion and\r\nphilosophy. The sturdier the growth of the spirit of inquiry, the more\r\nardent became the longing to reach this goal, the keener became the\r\nperception of the problems of life and faith. Arabic and Jewish thinkers\r\nzealously sought the path leading to serenity. Though they never entered\r\nupon it, their tentative efforts naturally prepared the way for a great\r\ncomprehensive intellect. Only a genius, master of all the sciences,\r\ncombining soundness of judgment and clearness of insight with great\r\nmental vigor and depth, can succeed in reconciling the divergent\r\nprinciples of theology and speculation, if such reconciliation be within\r\nthe range of the possible. At Cordova, in 1135, when the sun of Arabic\r\nculture reached its zenith, was born Maimonides, the man gifted with\r\nthis all-embracing mind.\r\n\r\nMany incidents in his life, not less interesting than his philosophic\r\ndevelopment, have come down to us. His father was his first teacher. To\r\nescape the persecutions of the Almohades, Maimonides, then thirteen\r\nyears old, removed to Fez with his family. There religious persecution\r\nforced Jews to abjure their faith, and the family of Maimon, like many\r\nothers, had to comply, outwardly at least, with the requirements of\r\nIslam. At Fez Maimonides was on intimate terms with physicians and\r\nphilosophers. At the same time, both in personal intercourse with them\r\nand in his writings, he exhorted his pseudo-Mohammedan brethren to\r\nremain true to Judaism. This would have cost him his life, had he not\r\nbeen rescued by the kindly offices of Mohammedan theologians. The\r\nfeeling of insecurity induced his family to leave Fez and join the\r\nJewish community in Palestine. \"They embarked at dead of night. On the\r\nsixth day of their voyage on the Mediterranean, a frightful storm arose;\r\nmountainous waves tossed the frail ship about like a ball; shipwreck\r\nseemed imminent. The pious family besought God's protection. Maimonides\r\nvowed that if he were rescued from threatening death, he would, as a\r\nthank-offering for himself and his family, spend two days in fasting and\r\ndistributing alms, and devote another day to solitary communion with\r\nGod. The storm abated, and after a month's voyage, the vessel ran into\r\nthe harbor of Accho.\"[38] The travellers met with a warm welcome, but\r\nthey tarried only a brief while, and finally settled permanently in\r\nEgypt. There, too, disasters befell Maimonides, who found solace only in\r\nhis implicit reliance on God and his enthusiastic devotion to learning.\r\nIt was then that Maimonides became the religious guide of his brethren.\r\nAt the same time he attained to eminence in his medical practice, and\r\ndevoted himself zealously to the study of philosophy and the natural\r\nsciences. Yet he did not escape calumny, and until 1185 fortune refused\r\nto smile upon him. In that year a son, afterwards the joy and pride of\r\nhis heart, was born to him. Then he was appointed physician at the court\r\nof Saladin, and so great was his reputation that Richard Coeur de Lion\r\nwished to make him his physician in ordinary, but Maimonides refused the\r\noffer. Despite the fact that his works raised many enemies against him,\r\nhis influence grew in the congregations of his town and province. From\r\nall sides questions were addressed to him, and when religious points\r\nwere under debate, his opinion usually decided the issue. At his death\r\nat the age of seventy great mourning prevailed in Israel. His mortal\r\nremains were moved to Tiberias, and a legend reports that Bedouins\r\nattacked the funeral train. Finding it impossible to move the coffin\r\nfrom the spot, they joined the Jews, and followed the great man to his\r\nlast resting-place. The deep reverence accorded him both by the moral\r\nsense and the exuberant fancy of his race is best expressed in the brief\r\neulogy of the saying, now become almost a proverb: \"From Moses, the\r\nProphet, to Moses ben Maimon, there appeared none like unto Moses.\"\r\n\r\nIn three different spheres Maimonides' work produced important results.\r\nFirst in order stand his services to his fellow-believers. For them he\r\ncompiled the great Codex, the first systematic arrangement, upon the\r\nbasis of Talmudic tradition, of all the ordinances and tenets of\r\nJudaism. He gave them a system of ethics which even now should be\r\nprized, because it inculcates the highest possible ethical views and the\r\nmost ideal conception of man's duties in life. He explained to them,\r\nalmost seven hundred years ago, Islam's service to mankind, and the\r\nmission Christianity was appointed by Providence to accomplish.\r\n\r\nHis early writings reveal the fundamental principles of his subsequent\r\nliterary work. An astronomical treatise on the Jewish calendar, written\r\nin his early youth, illustrates his love of system, but his peculiar\r\nmethod of thinking and working is best shown in the two works that\r\nfollowed. The first is a commentary on parts of the Talmud, probably\r\nmeant to present such conclusions of the Babylonian and the Jerusalem\r\nTalmud as affect the practices of Judaism. The second is his Arabic\r\ncommentary on the Mishna. He explains the Mishna simply and clearly from\r\na strictly rabbinical point of view--a point of view which he never\r\nrelinquished, permitting a deviation only in questions not affecting\r\nconduct. Master of the abundant material of Jewish literature, he felt\r\nit to be one of the most important tasks of the age to simplify, by\r\nmethodical treatment, the study of the mass of written and traditional\r\nreligious laws, accumulated in the course of centuries. It is this work\r\nthat contains the attempt, praised by some, condemned by others, to\r\nestablish articles of the Jewish faith, the Bible being used in\r\nauthentication. Thirteen articles of faith were thus established. The\r\nfirst five naturally define the God-idea: Article 1 declares the\r\nexistence of God, 2, His unity, 3, His immateriality, 4, His eternity,\r\n5, that unto Him alone, to whom all created life owes its being, human\r\nadoration is due; the next four treat of revelation: 6, of revelations\r\nmade through prophets in general, 7, of the revelation made through\r\nMoses, 8, of the divine origin of the Law, 9, of the perfection of the\r\nLaw, and its eternally binding force; and the rest dwell upon the\r\ndivine government of the world: 10, Divine Providence, 11, reward and\r\npunishment, here and hereafter, 12, Messianic promises and hopes, and\r\n13, resurrection.\r\n\r\nMaimonides' high reputation among his own people is attested by his\r\nletters and responses, containing detailed answers to vexed religious\r\nquestions. An especially valuable letter is the one upon \"Enforced\r\nApostasy,\" _Iggereth ha-Sh'mad_. He advises an inquirer what to do when\r\nmenaced by religious persecutions. Is one to save life by accepting, or\r\nto court death by refusing to embrace, the Mohammedan faith? Maimonides'\r\nopinion is summed up in the words: \"The solution which I always\r\nrecommend to my friends and those consulting me is, to leave such\r\nregions, and to turn to a place in which religion can be practiced\r\nwithout fear of persecution. No considerations of danger, of property,\r\nor of family should prevent one from carrying out this purpose. The\r\ndivine Law stands in higher esteem with the wise than the haphazard\r\ngifts of fortune. These pass away, the former remains.\" His responses as\r\nwell as his most important works bear the impress of a sane,\r\nwell-ordered mind, of a lofty intellect, dwelling only upon what is\r\ntruly great.\r\n\r\nAlso his second famous work, the above-mentioned Hebrew Codex, _Mishneh\r\nTorah_, \"Recapitulation of the Law,\" was written in the interest of his\r\nbrethren in faith. Its fourteen divisions treat of knowledge, love, the\r\nfestivals, marriage laws, sanctifications, vows, seeds, Temple-service,\r\nsacrifices, purifications, damages, purchase and sale, courts, and\r\njudges. \"My work is such,\" says Maimonides, \"that my book in connection\r\nwith the Bible will enable a student to dispense with the Talmud.\" From\r\nwhatever point of view this work may be regarded, it must be admitted\r\nthat Maimonides carried out his plan with signal success, and that it is\r\nthe only one by which method could have been introduced into the\r\nmanifold departments of Jewish religious lore. But it is obvious that\r\nthe thinker had not yet reached the goal of his desires. In consonance\r\nwith his fundamental principle, a scientific systemization of religious\r\nlaws had to be followed up by an explanation of revealed religion and\r\nGreek-Arabic philosophy, and by the attempt to bring about a\r\nreconciliation between them.\r\n\r\nBefore we enter upon this his greatest book, it is well to dispose of\r\nthe second phase of his work, his activity as a medical writer.\r\nMaimonides treated medicine as a science, a view not usual in those\r\ndays. The body of facts relating to medicine he classified, as he had\r\nsystematized the religious laws of the Talmud. In his methodical way, he\r\nalso edited the writings of Galen, the medical oracle of the middle\r\nages, and his own medical aphorisms and treatises are marked by the same\r\nlove of system. It seems that he had the intention to prepare a medical\r\ncodex to serve a purpose similar to that of his religious code. How\r\ngreat a reputation he enjoyed among Mohammedan physicians is shown by\r\nthe extravagantly enthusiastic verses of an Arabic poet:\r\n\r\n    \"Of body's ills doth Galen's art relieve,\r\n    Maimonides cures mind and body both,--\r\n    His wisdom heals disease and ignorance.\r\n    And should the moon invoke his skill and art,\r\n    Her spots, when full her orb, would disappear;\r\n    He'd fill her breach, when time doth inroads make,\r\n    And cure her, too, of pallor caused by earth.\"\r\n\r\nMaimonides' real greatness, however, must be sought in his philosophic\r\nwork. Despite the wide gap between our intellectual attitude and the\r\nphilosophic views to which Maimonides gave fullest expression, we can\r\nproperly appreciate his achievements and his intellectual grasp by\r\njudging him with reference to his own time. When we realize that he\r\nabsorbed all the thought-currents of his time, that he was their\r\nfaithful expounder, and that, at the same time, he was gifted with an\r\naccurate, historic instinct, making him wholly objective, we shall\r\nrecognize in him \"the genius of his peculiar epoch become incarnate.\"\r\nThe work containing Maimonides' deepest thought and the sum of his\r\nknowledge and erudition was written in Arabic under the name _Dalalat\r\nal-Hairin_. In Hebrew it is known as _Moreh Nebuchim_, in Latin, as\r\n_Doctor Perplexorum_, and in English as the \"Guide of the Perplexed.\" To\r\nthis book we shall now devote our attention. The original Arabic text\r\nwas supposed, along with many other literary treasures of the middle\r\nages, to be lost, until Solomon Munk, the blind _savant_ with clear\r\nvision, discovered it in the library at Paris, and published it. But in\r\nits Hebrew translation the book created a stir, which subsided only with\r\nits public burning at Montpellier early in the thirteenth century. The\r\nLatin translation we owe to Buxtorf; the German is, I believe,\r\nincomplete, and can hardly be said to give evidence of ripe\r\nscholarship.[39]\r\n\r\nThe question that naturally suggests itself is: What does the book\r\ncontain? Does it establish a new system of philosophy? Is it a\r\ncyclopaedia of the sciences, such as the Arab schools of that day were\r\nwont to produce? Neither the one nor the other. The \"Guide of the\r\nPerplexed\" is a system of rational theology upon a philosophic basis, a\r\nbook not intended for novices, but for thinkers, for such minds as know\r\nhow to penetrate the profound meaning of tradition, as the author says\r\nin a prefatory letter addressed to Joseph ibn Aknin, his favorite\r\ndisciple. He believes that even those to whom the book appeals are often\r\npuzzled and confused by the apparent inconsistencies between the literal\r\ninterpretation of the Bible and the evidence of reason, that they do not\r\nknow whether to take Scriptural expressions as symbolic or allegoric, or\r\nto accept them in their literal meaning, and that they fall a prey to\r\ndoubt, and long for a guide. Maimonides is prepared to lead them to an\r\neminence on which religion and philosophy meet in perfect harmony.\r\n\r\nEducated in the school of Arabic philosophers, notably under the\r\ninfluence of Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Maimonides paid hero-worship to\r\nAristotle, the autocrat of the middle ages in the realm of speculation.\r\nThere is no question that the dominion wielded by the Greek philosopher\r\nthroughout mediaeval times, and the influence which he exercises even\r\nnow, are chiefly attributable to the Arabs, and beside them,\r\npre-eminently to Maimonides. For him, Aristotle was second in authority\r\nonly to the Bible. A rational interpretation of the Bible, in his\r\nopinion, meant its interpretation from an Aristotelian point of view.\r\nStill, he does not consider Aristotle other than a thinker like himself,\r\nnot by any means the infallible \"organ of reason.\" The moment he\r\ndiscovers that a peripatetic principle is in direct and irreconcilable\r\nconflict with his religious convictions, he parts company with it, let\r\nthe effort cost what it may. For, above all, Maimonides was a faithful\r\nJew, striving to reach a spiritual conception of his religion, and to\r\nassign to theology the place in his estimation belonging to it in the\r\nrealm of science. He stands forth as the most eminent intermediary\r\nbetween Greek-Arabic thought and Christian scholasticism. A century\r\nlater, the most prominent of the schoolmen endeavored, in the same way\r\nas Maimonides, to reconcile divine with human wisdom as manifested by\r\nAristotle. It has been demonstrated that Maimonides was followed by both\r\nAlbertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas, and that the new aims of philosophy,\r\nconceived at the beginning of the thirteenth century, are, in part, to\r\nbe traced to the influence of \"Rabbi Moses of Egypt,\" as Maimonides was\r\ncalled by the first of these two celebrated doctors of the Church.\r\n\r\nWhat a marvellous picture is presented by the unfolding of the\r\nAristotelian idea in its passage through the ages! And one of the most\r\nattractive figures on the canvas is Maimonides. Let us see how he\r\nundertakes to guide the perplexed. His path is marked out for him by the\r\nBible. Its first few verses suffice to puzzle the believing thinker. It\r\nsays: \"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.\" What! Is this\r\nexpression to be taken literally? Impossible! To conceive of God as such\r\nthat a being can be made in His image, is to conceive of Him as a\r\ncorporeal substance. But God is an invisible, immaterial Intelligence.\r\nReason teaches this, and the sacred Book itself prohibits image-worship.\r\nOn this point Aristotle and the Bible are in accord. The inference is\r\nthat in the Holy Scriptures there are many metaphors and words with a\r\ndouble or allegoric sense. Such is the case with the word \"image.\" It\r\nhas two meanings, the one usual and obvious, the other figurative. Here\r\nthe word must be taken in its figurative sense. God is conceived as the\r\nhighest Reason, and as reason is the specific attribute which\r\ncharacterizes the human mind, it follows that man, by virtue of his\r\npossession of reason, resembles God, and the more fully he realizes the\r\nideal of Reason, the closer does he approach the form and likeness of\r\nGod. Such is Maimonides' method of reasoning. He does not build up a new\r\nsystem of philosophy, he adopts an existing system. Beginning with Bible\r\nexegesis, he leads us, step by step, up to the lofty goal at which\r\nphilosophy and faith are linked in perfect harmony.\r\n\r\nThe arguments for the existence, unity, and incorporeity of God divide\r\nthe Arabic philosophers into two schools. Maimonides naturally espoused\r\nthe view permitting the most exalted conception of God, that is, the\r\nconception of God free from human attributes. He recognizes none but\r\nnegative attributes; in other words, he defines God by means of\r\nnegations only. For instance, asserting that the Supreme Being is\r\nomniscient or omnipotent, is not investing Him with a positive\r\nattribute, it is simply denying imperfection. The student knows that in\r\nthe history of the doctrine of attributes, the recognition of negative\r\nattributes marks a great advance in philosophic reasoning. Maimonides\r\nholds that the conception of the Deity as a pure abstraction is the only\r\none truly philosophic. His evidences for the existence, the\r\nimmateriality, and the unity of God, are conceived in the same spirit.\r\nIn offering them he follows Aristotle's reasoning closely, adding only\r\none other proof, the cosmological, which he took from his teacher, the\r\nArab Avicenna. He logically reaches this proof by more explicitly\r\ndefining the God-idea, and, at the same time, taking into consideration\r\nthe nature of the world of things and their relation to one another.\r\nAcquainted with Ptolemy's \"Almagest\" and with the investigations of the\r\nArabs, he naturally surpasses his Greek master in astronomical\r\nknowledge. In physical science, however, he gives undivided allegiance\r\nto the Aristotelian theory of a sublunary and a celestial world of\r\nspheres, the former composed of the sublunary elements in constantly\r\nshifting, perishable combinations, and the latter, of the stable,\r\nunchanging fifth substance (quintessence). But the question, how God\r\nmoves these spheres, separates Maimonides from his master. His own\r\nanswer has a Neoplatonic ring. He holds, with Aristotle, that there are\r\nas many separate Intelligences as spheres. Each sphere is supposed to\r\naspire to the Intelligence which is the principle of its motion. The\r\nArabic thinkers assumed ten such independent Intelligences, one\r\nanimating each of the nine permanent spheres, and the tenth, called the\r\n\"Active Intellect,\" influencing the sublunary world of matter. The\r\nexistence of this tenth Intelligence is proved by the transition of our\r\nown intellect from possible existence to actuality, and by the varying\r\nforms of all transient things, whose matter at one time existed only in\r\na potential state. Whenever the transition from potentiality to\r\nactuality occurs, there must be a cause. Inasmuch as the tenth\r\nIntelligence (_Sechel Hapoel_, Active Intellect) induces form, it must\r\nitself be form, inasmuch as it is the source of intellect, it is itself\r\nintellect. This is, of course, obscure to us, but we must remember that\r\nMaimonides would not have so charming and individual a personality,\r\nwere he not part and parcel of his time and the representative of its\r\nbelief. Maimonides, having for once deviated from the peripatetic\r\nsystem, ventures to take another bold step away from it. He offers an\r\nexplanation, different from Aristotle's, of the creation of the world.\r\nThe latter repudiated the _creatio ex nihilo_ (creation out of nothing).\r\nLike modern philosophers, he pre-supposed the existence of an eternal\r\n\"First substance\" (_materia prima_). His Bible does not permit our rabbi\r\nto avail himself of this theory. It was reserved for the modern\r\ninvestigator to demonstrate how the Scriptural word, with some little\r\nmanipulation, can be so twisted as to be made to harmonize with the\r\ntheories of natural science. But to such trickery the pure-minded guide\r\nwill not stoop. Besides, the acceptance of Aristotle's theory would rule\r\nout the intervention of miracles in the conduct of the world, and that\r\nMaimonides does not care to renounce. Right here his monotheistic\r\nconvictions force him into direct opposition to the Greek as well as to\r\nthe Arabic philosophers. Upon this subject, he brooked neither trifling\r\nnor compromise with reason. It is precisely his honesty that so exalted\r\nhis teachings, that they have survived the lapse of centuries, and\r\nmaintain a place in the pure atmosphere of modern philosophic thought.\r\n\r\nAccording to Maimonides, man has absolute free-will, and God is\r\nabsolutely just. Whatever good befalls man is reward, all his evil\r\nfortune, punishment. What Aristotle attributes to chance, and the\r\nMohammedan philosophers to Divine Will or Divine Wisdom, our rabbi\r\ntraces to the _merits of man_ as its cause. He does not admit any\r\nsuffering to be unmerited, or that God ordains trials merely to\r\nindemnify the sufferer in this or the future world. Man's susceptibility\r\nto divine influence is measured by his intellectual endowment. Through\r\nhis \"intellect,\" he is directly connected with the \"Active Intellect,\"\r\nand thus secures the grace of God, who embraces the infinite. Such views\r\nnaturally lead to a conception of life in consonance with the purest\r\nideals of morality, and they are the goal to which the \"Guide\" leads the\r\nperplexed. He teaches that the acquiring of high intellectual power, and\r\nthe \"possession of such notions as lead to true metaphysical opinions\"\r\nabout God, are \"man's final object,\" and they constitute true human\r\nperfection. This it is that \"gives him immortality,\" and confers upon\r\nhim the dignity of manhood.\r\n\r\nThe highest degree of perfection, according to Maimonides, is reached by\r\nhim who devotes all his thoughts and actions to perfecting himself in\r\ndivine matters, and this highest degree he calls prophecy. He is\r\nprobably the first philosopher to offer so rationalistic an explanation,\r\nand, on that account, it merits our attention. What had previously been\r\nregarded as supernatural inspiration, the \"Guide\" reduces to a\r\npsychological theory. \"Prophecy,\" he says, \"is, in truth and reality, an\r\nemanation sent forth by the Divine Being through the medium of the\r\nActive Intellect, in the first instance to man's rational faculty, and\r\nthen to his imaginative faculty; it is the highest degree ... of\r\nperfection man can attain; it consists in the most perfect development\r\nof the imaginative faculty.\" Maimonides distinguishes eleven degrees of\r\ninspiration, and three essential conditions of prophecy: 1. Perfection\r\nof the natural constitution of the imaginative faculty, 2. mental\r\nperfection, which may partially be acquired by training, and 3. moral\r\nperfection. Moses arrived at the highest degree of prophecy, because he\r\nunderstood the knowledge communicated to him without the medium of the\r\nimaginative faculty. This spiritual height having been scaled, the\r\n\"Guide\" needs but to take a step to reach revelation, in his estimation\r\nalso an intellectual process: man's intellect rises to the Supreme\r\nBeing.\r\n\r\nIn the third part of his work, Maimonides endeavors to reconcile the\r\nconclusions of philosophy with biblical laws and Talmudical traditions.\r\nHis method is both original and valuable; indeed, this deserves to be\r\nconsidered the most important part of his work. Detailed exposition of\r\nhis reasoning may prove irksome; we shall, therefore, consider it as\r\nbriefly as possible.\r\n\r\nMaimonides laid down one rule of interpretation which, almost without\r\nexception, proves applicable: The words of Holy Writ express different\r\nsets of ideas, bearing a certain relation to each other, the one set\r\nhaving reference to physical, the other to spiritual, qualities. By\r\napplying this rule, he thinks that nearly all discrepancies between the\r\nliteral interpretation of the Bible and his own philosophic theories\r\ndisappear. Having passed over the domain of metaphysical speculation, he\r\nfinally reaches the consideration of the practical side of the Bible,\r\nthat is to say, the Mosaic legislation. These last investigations of his\r\nare attractive, not only by reason of the satisfactory method pursued,\r\nbut chiefly from the fact that Maimonides, divesting himself of the\r\nconservatism of his contemporaries, ventures to inquire into the reasons\r\nof biblical laws. For many of them, he assigns local and historical\r\nreasons; many, he thinks, owe their origin to the desire to oppose the\r\nsuperstitious practices of early times and of the Sabeans, a mythical,\r\nprimitive race; but all, he contends, are binding, and with this solemn\r\nasseveration, he puts the seal upon his completed work.\r\n\r\nWhen Maimonides characterized the \"Guide of the Perplexed\" as \"the true\r\nscience of the Bible,\" he formed a just estimate of his own work. It has\r\ncome to be the substructure of a rational theology based upon\r\nspeculation. Maimonides cannot be said to have been very much ahead of\r\nhis own age; but it is altogether certain that he attained the acme of\r\nthe possibilities of the middle ages. In many respects there is a\r\nstriking likeness between his life and work and those of the Arabic\r\nfreethinker Averroes, whom we now know so well through Ernest Renan.\r\nWhile the Jewish theologian was composing his great work, the Arabic\r\nphilosopher was writing his \"Commentaries on Aristotle.\" The two had\r\nsimilar ends in view--the one to enthrone \"the Stagirite\" as the\r\nautocrat of philosophy in the Mosque, the other, in the Synagogue. We\r\nhave noted the fact that, some centuries later, the Church also entered\r\nthe federation subject to Aristotelian rule. Albertus Magnus uses\r\nMaimonides, Thomas Aquinas joins him, and upon them depend the other\r\nschoolmen. Recent inquirers follow in their train. Philosophy's noblest\r\nvotary, Benedict Spinoza himself, is influenced by Maimonides. He quotes\r\nfrequently and at great length the finest passages of the \"Guide.\"\r\nAgain, Moses Mendelssohn built his system on the foundations offered by\r\nMaimonides, and an acute critic assures us that, in certain passages,\r\nKant's religious philosophy breathes the spirit of Maimonides.[40]\r\n\r\nThe \"Guide of the Perplexed\" did not, however, meet with so gracious a\r\nreception in the Synagogue. There, Maimonides' philosophic system\r\nconjured up violent storms. The whole of an epoch, that following\r\nMaimonides' death, was absorbed in the conflict between philosophy and\r\ntradition. Controversial pamphlets without number have come down to us\r\nfrom those days. Enthusiasts eulogized, zealots decried. Maimonides'\r\nambiguous expressions about bodily resurrection, seeming to indicate\r\nthat he did not subscribe to the article of the creed on that subject,\r\ncaused particularly acrimonious polemics. Meir ben Todros ha-Levi, a\r\nTalmudist and poet of Toledo, denounced the equivocation in the\r\nfollowing lines:\r\n\r\n    \"If those that rise from death again must die,\r\n    For lot like theirs I ne'er should long and sigh.\r\n    If graves their bones shall once again confine,\r\n    I hope to stay where first they bury mine.\"\r\n\r\nNaturally, Maimonides' followers were quick to retort:\r\n\r\n    \"His name, forsooth, is Meir 'Shining.'\r\n      How false! since _light_ he holds in small esteem.\r\n    Our language always contrast loveth,--\r\n      Twi_light_'s the name of ev'ning's doubtful gleam.\"\r\n\r\nAnother of Maimonides' opponents was the physician Judah Alfachar, who\r\nbore the hereditary title _Prince_. The following pasquinade is\r\nattributed to him:\r\n\r\n    \"Forgive, O Amram's son, nor deem it crime,\r\n      That he, deception's master, bears thy name.\r\n    _Nabi_ we call the prophet of truths sublime,\r\n      Like him of Ba'al, who doth the truth defame.\"\r\n\r\nMaimonides, in his supposed reply to the Prince, played upon the word\r\n_Chamor_, the Hebrew word for _ass_, the name of a Hivite prince\r\nmentioned in the Bible:\r\n\r\n    \"High rank, I wot, we proudly claim\r\n      When sprung from noble ancestor;\r\n    Henceforth my mule a _prince_ I'll name\r\n      Since once a prince was called _Chamor_.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems altogether certain that this polemic rhyming is the fabrication\r\nof a later day, for we know that the controversies about Maimonides'\r\nopinions in Spain and Provence broke out only after his death, when his\r\nchief work had spread far and wide in its Hebrew translation. The\r\nfollowing stanza passed from mouth to mouth in northern France:\r\n\r\n    \"Be silent, 'Guide,' from further speech refrain!\r\n      Thus truth to us was never brought.\r\n    Accursed who says that Holy Writ's a trope,\r\n      And idle dreams what prophets taught.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon the Provencals returned:\r\n\r\n    \"Thou fool, I pray thou wilt forbear,\r\n      Nor enter on this consecrated ground.\r\n    Or trope, or truth--or vision fair,\r\n      Or only dream--for thee 'tis too profound.\"\r\n\r\nThe homage paid to Maimonides' memory in many instances produced most\r\nextravagant poetry. The following high-flown lines, outraging the canons\r\nof good taste recognized in Hebrew poetry, are supposed to be his\r\nepitaph:\r\n\r\n    \"Here lies a man, yet not a man,\r\n    And if a man, conceived by angels,\r\n      By human mother only born to light;\r\n    Perhaps himself a spirit pure--\r\n    Not child by man and woman fostered--\r\n      From God above an emanation bright.\"\r\n\r\nSuch hyperbole naturally challenged opposition, and Maimonides'\r\nopponents did not hesitate to give voice to their deep indignation, as\r\nin the following:\r\n\r\n    \"Alas! that man should dare\r\n    To say, with reckless air,\r\n      That Holy Scripture's but a dream of night;\r\n    That all we read therein\r\n    Has truly never been,\r\n      Is naught but sign of meaning recondite.\r\n    And when God's wondrous deeds\r\n    The haughty scorner reads,\r\n      Contemptuous he cries, 'I trust my sight.'\"\r\n\r\nA cessation of hostilities came only in the fourteenth century. The\r\n\"Guide\" was then given its due meed of appreciation by the Jews. Later,\r\nMaimonides' memory was held in unbounded reverence, and to-day his\r\n\"Guide of the Perplexed\" is a manual of religious philosophy treasured\r\nby Judaism.\r\n\r\nIf we wish once more before parting from this earnest, noble thinker to\r\nreview his work and attitude, we can best do it by applying to them the\r\nstandard furnished by his own reply to all adverse critics of his\r\nwritings: \"In brief, such is my disposition. When a thought fills my\r\nmind, though I be able to express it so that only a single man among ten\r\nthousand, a thinker, is satisfied and elevated by it, while the common\r\ncrowd condemns it as absurd, I boldly and frankly speak the word that\r\nenlightens the wise, never fearing the censure of the ignorant herd.\"\r\n\r\nThis was Maimonides--he of pure thought, of noble purpose; imbued with\r\nenthusiasm for his faith, with love for science; ruled by the loftiest\r\nmoral principles; full of disinterested love and the milk of human\r\nkindness in his intercourse with those of other faiths and other views;\r\nan eagle-eyed thinker, in whom were focused and harmoniously blended the\r\nlast rays of the declining sun of Arabic-Jewish-Spanish culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEWISH TROUBADOURS AND MINNESINGERS\r\n\r\n\r\nA great tournament at the court of Pedro I.! Deafening fanfares invite\r\ncourtiers and cavaliers to participate in the festivities. In the\r\nbrilliant sunshine gleam the lances of the knights, glitter the spears\r\nof the hidalgos. Gallant paladins escort black-eyed beauties to the\r\nelevated balcony, on which, upon a high-raised throne, under a gilded\r\ncanopy, surrounded by courtiers, sit Blanche de Bourbon and her\r\nillustrious lord Dom Pedro, with Dona Maria de Padilla, the lady of his\r\nchoice, at his left. Three times the trumpets have sounded, announcing\r\nthe approach of the troubadours gathered from all parts of Castile to\r\ncompete with one another in song. Behold! a venerable old man, with\r\nsilvery white beard flowing down upon his breast, seeks to extricate\r\nhimself from the crowd. With admiring gaze the people respectfully make\r\nway, and enthusiastically greet him: \"Rabbi Don Santo! Rabbi Don Santo!\"\r\n\r\nThe troubadour makes a low obeisance before the throne. Dom Pedro nods\r\nencouragement, Maria de Padilla smiles graciously, only Dona Blanca's\r\npallid face remains immobile. The hoary bard begins his song:[41]\r\n\r\n    \"My noble king and mighty lord,\r\n      A discourse hear most true;\r\n    'Tis Santob brings your Grace the word,\r\n      Of Carrion's town the Jew.\r\n\r\n    In plainest verse my thought I tell,\r\n      With gloss and moral free,\r\n    Drawn from Philosophy's pure well,\r\n      As onward you may see.\"[42]\r\n\r\nA murmur of approval runs through the crowd; grandees and hidalgos press\r\ncloser to listen. In well-turned verse, fraught with worldly-wise\r\nlessons, and indifferent whether his hortations meet with praise or with\r\ncensure, the poet continues to pour out words of counsel and moral\r\nteachings, alike for king, nobles, and people.\r\n\r\nWho is this Rabbi Don Santob? We know very little about him, yet, with\r\nthe help of \"bright-eyed fancy,\" enough to paint his picture. The real\r\nname of this Jew from Carrion de los Condes, a city of northern Spain,\r\nwho lived under Alfonso XI and Peter the Cruel, was, of course, not\r\nSantob, but Shem-Tob. Under Alfonso the intellectual life of Spain\r\ndeveloped to a considerable degree, and in Spain, as almost everywhere,\r\nwe find Jews in sympathy with the first intellectual strivings of the\r\nnation. They have a share in the development of all Romance languages\r\nand literatures. Ibn Alfange, a Moorish Jew, after his conversion a high\r\nofficial, wrote the first \"Chronicle of the Cid,\" the oldest source of\r\nthe oft-repeated biography, thus furnishing material to subsequent\r\nSpanish poets and historians. Valentin Barruchius (Baruch), of Toledo,\r\ncomposed, probably in the twelfth century, in pure, choice Latin, the\r\nromance _Comte Lyonnais, Palanus_, which spread all over Europe,\r\naffording modern poets subject-matter for great tragedies, and forming\r\nthe groundwork for one of the classics of Spanish literature. A little\r\nlater, Petrus Alphonsus (Moses Sephardi) wrote his _Disciplina\r\nClericalis_, the first collection of tales in the Oriental manner, the\r\nmodel of all future collections of the kind.\r\n\r\nThree of the most important works of Spanish literature, then, are\r\nproducts of Jewish authorship. This fact prepares the student to find a\r\nJew among the Castilian troubadours of the fourteenth century, the\r\nperiod of greatest literary activity. The Jewish spirit was by no means\r\nantagonistic to the poetry of the Provencal troubadours. In his didactic\r\npoem, _Chotham Tochnith_ (\"The Seal of Perfection,\" together with \"The\r\nFlaming Sword\"), Abraham Bedersi, that is, of Beziers (1305), challenges\r\nhis co-religionists to a poetic combat. He details the rules of the\r\ntournament, and it is evident that he is well acquainted with all the\r\nminutiae of the _jeu parti_ and the _tenso_ (song of dispute) of the\r\nProvencal singers, and would willingly imitate their _sirventes_ (moral\r\nand political song). His plaint over the decadence of poetry among the\r\nJews is characteristic: \"Where now are the marvels of Hebrew poetry?\r\nMayhap thou'lt find them in the Provencal or Romance. Aye, in Folquet's\r\nverses is manna, and from the lips of Cardinal is wafted the perfume of\r\ncrocus and nard\"--Folquet de Lunel and Peire Cardinal being the last\r\ngreat representatives of Provencal troubadour poetry. Later on,\r\nneo-Hebraic poets again show acquaintance with the regulations governing\r\nsong-combats and courts of love. Pious Bible exegetes, like Samuel ben\r\nMeir, do not disdain to speak of the _partimens_ of the troubadours, \"in\r\nwhich lovers talk to each other, and by turns take up the discourse.\"\r\nOne of his school, a _Tossafist_, goes so far as to press into service\r\nthe day's fashion in explaining the meaning of a verse in the \"Song of\r\nSongs\": \"To this day lovers treasure their mistress' locks as\r\nlove-tokens.\" It seems, too, that Provencal romances were heard, and\r\ntheir great poets welcomed, in the houses of Jews, who did not scruple\r\noccasionally to use their melodies in the synagogue service.\r\n\r\nNational customs, then, took root in Israel; but that Jewish elements\r\nshould have become incorporated into Spanish literature is more\r\nremarkable, may, indeed, be called marvellous. Yet, from one point of\r\nview, it is not astonishing. The whole of mediaeval Spanish literature is\r\nnothing more than the handmaiden of Christianity. Spanish poetry is\r\ncompletely dominated by Catholicism; it is in reality only an expression\r\nof reverence for Christian institutions. An extreme naturally induces a\r\ncounter-current; so here, by the side of rigid orthodoxy, we meet with\r\nlatitudinarianism and secular delight in the good things of life. For\r\ninstance, that jolly rogue, the archpriest of Hita, by way of relaxation\r\nfrom the tenseness of church discipline, takes to composing _dansas_ and\r\n_baladas_ for the rich Jewish bankers of his town. He and his\r\ncontemporaries have much to say about Jewish generosity--unfortunately,\r\nmuch, too, about Jewish wealth and pomp. Jewish women, a Jewish\r\nchronicler relates, are tricked out with finery, as \"sumptuously as the\r\npope's mules.\" It goes without saying that, along with these accounts,\r\nwe have frequent wailing about defection from the faith and neglect of\r\nthe Law. Old Akiba is right: \"History repeats itself!\" (\"_Es ist alles\r\nschon einmal da gewesen!_\").\r\n\r\nSuch were the times of Santob de Carrion. Our first information about\r\nhim comes from the Marquis de Santillana, one of the early patrons and\r\nleaders of Spanish literature. He says, \"In my grandfather's time there\r\nwas a Jew, Rabbi Santob, who wrote many excellent things, among them\r\n_Proverbios Morales_ (Moral Proverbs), truly commendable in spirit. A\r\ngreat troubadour, he ranks among the most celebrated poets of Spain.\"\r\nDespite this high praise, the marquis feels constrained to apologize for\r\nhaving quoted a passage from Santob's work. His praise is endorsed by\r\nthe critics. It is commonly conceded that his _Consejos y Documentos al\r\nRey Dom Pedro_ (\"Counsel and Instruction to King Dom Pedro\"), consisting\r\nof six hundred and twenty-eight romances, deserves a place among the\r\nbest creations of Castilian poetry, which, in form and substance, owes\r\nnot a little to Rabbi Santob. A valuable manuscript at the Escurial in\r\nMadrid contains his _Consejos_ and two other works, _La Doctrina\r\nChristiana_ and _Dansa General_. A careless copyist called the whole\r\ncollection \"Rabbi Santob's Book,\" so giving rise to the mistake of\r\nSpanish critics, who believe that Rabbi Santob, indisputably the author\r\nof _Consejos_, became a convert to Christianity, and wrote, after his\r\nconversion, the didactic poem on doctrinal Christianity, and perhaps\r\nalso the first \"Dance of Death.\"[43] It was reserved for the acuteness\r\nof German criticism to expose the error of this hypothesis. Of the three\r\nworks, only _Consejos_ belongs to Rabbi Santob, the others were\r\naccidentally bound with it. In passing, the interesting circumstance may\r\nbe noted that in the first \"Dance of Death\" a bearded rabbi (_Rabbi\r\nbarbudo_) dances toward the universal goal between a priest and an\r\nusurer. Santob de Carrion remained a Jew. His _consejos_, written when\r\nhe was advanced in age, are pervaded by loyalty to his king, but no less\r\nto his faith, which he openly professed at the royal court, and whose\r\nspiritual treasures he adroitly turned to poetic uses.\r\n\r\nSantob, it is interesting to observe, was not a writer of erotic poetry.\r\nHe composed poems on moral subjects only, social satires and\r\ndenunciations of vice. Such are the _consejos_. It is in his capacity as\r\na preacher of morality that Santob is to be classed among troubadours.\r\nFirst he addressed himself, with becoming deference, to the king,\r\nleading him to consider God's omnipotence:\r\n\r\n    \"As great, 'twixt heav'n and earth the space--\r\n      That ether pure and blue--\r\n    So great is God's forgiving grace\r\n      Your sins to lift from you.\r\n\r\n    And with His vast and wondrous might\r\n      He does His deeds of power;\r\n    But yours are puny in His sight,\r\n      For strength is not man's dower.\"\r\n\r\nAt that time it required more than ordinary courage to address a king in\r\nthis fashion; but Santob was old and poor, and having nothing to lose,\r\ncould risk losing everything. A democratic strain runs through his\r\nverses; he delights in aiming his satires at the rich, the high-born,\r\nand the powerful, and takes pride in his poverty and his fame as a poet:\r\n\r\n    \"I will not have you think me less\r\n      Than others of my faith,\r\n    Who live on a generous king's largess,\r\n      Forsworn at every breath.\r\n\r\n    And if you deem my teachings true,\r\n      Reject them not with hate,\r\n    Because a minstrel sings to you\r\n      Who's not of knight's estate.\r\n\r\n    The fragrant, waving reed grows tall\r\n      From feeble root and thin,\r\n    And uncouth worms that lowly crawl\r\n      Most lustrous silk do spin.\r\n\r\n    Because beside a thorn it grows\r\n      The rose is not less fair;\r\n    Though wine from gnarled branches flows,\r\n      'Tis sweet beyond compare.\r\n\r\n    The goshawk, know, can soar on high,\r\n      Yet low he nests his brood.\r\n    A Jew true precepts doth apply,\r\n      Are they therefore less good?\r\n\r\n    Some Jews there are with slavish mind\r\n      Who fear, are mute, and meek.\r\n    My soul to truth is so inclined\r\n      That all I feel I speak.\r\n\r\n    There often comes a meaning home\r\n      Through simple verse and plain,\r\n    While in the heavy, bulky tome\r\n      We find of truth no grain.\r\n\r\n    Full oft a man with furrowed front,\r\n      Whom grief hath rendered grave,\r\n    Whose views of life are honest, blunt,\r\n      Both fool is called and knave.\"\r\n\r\nIt is surely not unwarranted to assume that from these confessions the\r\ndata of Santob's biography may be gathered.\r\n\r\nNow as to Santob's relation to Judaism. Doubtless he was a faithful Jew,\r\nfor the views of life and the world laid down in his poems rest on the\r\nBible, the Talmud, and the Midrash. With the fearlessness of conviction\r\nhe meets the king and the people, denouncing the follies of both. Some\r\nof his romances sound precisely like stories from the Haggada, so\r\nskilfully does he clothe his counsel in the gnomic style of the Bible\r\nand the Talmud. This characteristic is particularly well shown in his\r\nverses on friendship, into which he has woven the phraseology of the\r\nProverbs:\r\n\r\n    \"What treasure greater than a friend\r\n      Who close to us hath grown?\r\n    Blind fate no bitt'rer lot can send\r\n      Than bid us walk alone.\r\n\r\n    For solitude doth cause a dearth\r\n      Of fruitful, blessed thought.\r\n    The wise would pray to leave this earth,\r\n      If none their friendship sought.\r\n\r\n    Yet sad though loneliness may be,\r\n      That friendship surely shun\r\n    That feigns to love, and inwardly\r\n      Betrays affections won.\"\r\n\r\nThe poem closes with a prayer for the king, who certainly could not have\r\ntaken offense at Santob's frankness:\r\n\r\n    \"May God preserve our lord and king\r\n      With grace omnipotent,\r\n    Remove from us each evil thing,\r\n      And blessed peace augment.\r\n\r\n    The nations loyally allied\r\n      Our empire to exalt,\r\n    May God, in whom we all confide,\r\n      From plague keep and assault.\r\n\r\n    If God will answer my request,\r\n      Then will be paid his due--\r\n    Your noble father's last behest--\r\n      To Santob, Carrion's Jew.\"\r\n\r\nOur troubadour's poetry shows that he was devotedly attached to his\r\nprince, enthusiastically loved his country, and was unfalteringly loyal\r\nto his faith; that he told the king honest, wholesome truths disguised\r\nin verse; that he took no pains to conceal his scorn of those who, with\r\nbase servility, bowed to the ruling faith, and permitted its yoke to be\r\nput upon their necks; that he felt himself the peer of the high in rank,\r\nand the wealthy in the goods of this world; that he censured, with\r\nincisive criticism, the vices of his Spanish and his Jewish\r\ncontemporaries--all of which is calculated to inspire us with admiration\r\nfor the Jewish troubadour, whose manliness enabled him to meet his\r\ndetractors boldly, as in the verses quoted above:\r\n\r\n    \"Because beside a thorn it grows,\r\n      The rose is not less fair;\r\n    Though wine from gnarled branches flows,\r\n      'Tis sweet beyond compare.\r\n\r\n    A Jew true precepts doth apply,\r\n      Are they therefore less good?\"\r\n\r\nHistory does not tell us whether Pedro rewarded the Jewish troubadour as\r\nthe latter, if we may judge by the end of his poem, had expected. Our\r\naccounts of his life are meagre; even his fellow-believers do not make\r\nmention of him. We do know, however, that the poor poet's prayers for\r\nhis sovereign, his petitions for the weal and the glory of his country\r\nwere not granted. Pedro lost his life by violence, quarrels about the\r\nsuccession and civil wars convulsed the land, and weakened the royal\r\npower. Its decline marked the end of the peace and happiness of the Jew\r\non Castilian soil.\r\n\r\nAs times grew worse, and persecutions of the Jews in Christian Spain\r\nbecame frequent, many forsook the faith of their fathers, to bask in the\r\nsunshine of the Church, who treated proselytes with distinguished favor.\r\nThe example of the first Jewish troubadour did not find imitators. Among\r\nthe converts were many poets, notably Juan Alfonso de Baena, who, in the\r\nfifteenth century, collected the oldest troubadour poetry, including his\r\nown poems and satires, and the writings of the Jewish physician Don\r\nMoses Zarzal, into a _cancionera general_. Like many apostates, he\r\nsought to prove his devotion to the new faith by mocking at and reviling\r\nhis former brethren. The attacked were not slow to answer in kind, and\r\nthe Christian world of poets and bards joined the latter in deriding the\r\nneophytes. Spanish literature was not the loser by these combats, whose\r\ndescription belongs to general literary criticism. Lyric poetry, until\r\nthen dry, serious, and solemn, was infused by the satirist with flashing\r\nwit and whimsical spirit, and throwing off its connection with the\r\ndrama, developed into an independent species of poetry.\r\n\r\nThe last like the first of Spanish troubadours was a Jew,[44] Antonio di\r\nMontoro (Moro), _el ropero_ (the tailor), of Cordova, of whom a\r\ncontemporary says,\r\n\r\n    \"A man of repute and lofty fame;\r\n    As poet, he puts many to shame;\r\n    Anton di Montoro is his name.\"\r\n\r\nThe tailor-poet was exposed to attacks, too. A high and mighty Spanish\r\n_caballero_ addresses him as\r\n\r\n    \"You Cohn, you cur,\r\n    You miserable Jew,\r\n    You wicked usurer.\"\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that he parries these thrusts with weak, apologetic\r\nappeals, preserved in his _Respuestas_ (Rhymed Answers). He claims his\r\nhigh-born foe's sympathy by telling him that he has sons, grandchildren,\r\na poor, old father, and a marriageable daughter. In extenuation of his\r\ncowardice it should be remembered that Antonio di Montoro lived during a\r\nreign of terror, under Ferdinand and Isabella, when his race and his\r\nfaith were exposed to most frightful persecution. All the more\r\nnoteworthy is it that he had the courage to address the queen in behalf\r\nof his faith. He laments plaintively that despite his sixty years he has\r\nnot been able to eradicate all traces of his descent (_reato de su\r\norigen_), and turns his irony against himself:\r\n\r\n    \"Ropero, so sad and so forlorn,\r\n    Now thou feelest pain and scorn.\r\n    Until sixty years had flown,\r\n    Thou couldst say to every one,\r\n    'Nothing wicked have I known.'\r\n\r\n    Christian convert hast thou turned,\r\n    _Credo_ thou to say hast learned;\r\n    Willing art now bold to view\r\n    Plates of ham--no more askew.\r\n    Mass thou hearest,\r\n    Church reverest,\r\n    Genuflexions makest,\r\n    Other alien customs takest.\r\n    Now thou, too, mayst persecute\r\n    Those poor wretches, like a brute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those poor wretches\" were his brethren in faith in the fair Spanish\r\nland. With a jarring discord ends the history of the Jews in Spain. On\r\nthe ninth of Ab, 1492, three hundred thousand Jews left the land to\r\nwhich they had given its first and its last troubadour. The irony of\r\nfate directed that at the selfsame time Christopher Columbus should\r\nembark for unknown lands, and eventually reach America, a new world, the\r\nrefuge of all who suffer, wherein thought was destined to grow strong\r\nenough \"to vanquish arrogance and injustice without recourse to\r\narrogance and injustice\"--a new illustration of the old verse: \"Behold,\r\nhe slumbereth not, and he sleepeth not--the keeper of Israel.\"\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nA great tournament at the court of the lords of Trimberg, the Franconian\r\ntown on the Saale! From high battlements stream the pennons of the noble\r\nrace, announcing rare festivities to all the country round. The\r\nmountain-side is astir with knights equipped with helmet, shield, and\r\nlance, and attended by pages and armor-bearers, minnesingers and\r\nminstrels. Yonder is Walther von der Vogelweide, engaged in earnest\r\nconversation with Wolfram von Eschenbach, Otto von Botenlaube, Hildebold\r\nvon Schwanegau, and Reinmar von Brennenberg. In that group of notables,\r\ncuriously enough, we discern a Jew, whose beautiful features reflect\r\nharmonious soul life.\r\n\r\n\"Suesskind von Trimberg,\" they call him, and when the pleasure of the\r\nfeast in the lordly hall of the castle is to be heightened by song and\r\nmusic, he too steps forth, with fearlessness and dignity, to sing of\r\nfreedom of thought, to the prevalence of which in this company the\r\ndespised Jew owed his admission to a circle of knights and poets:[45]\r\n\r\n    \"O thought! free gift to humankind!\r\n      By thee both fools and wise are led,\r\n    But who thy paths hath all defined,\r\n      A man he is in heart and head.\r\n      With thee, his weakness being fled,\r\n    He can both stone and steel command,\r\n    Thy pinions bear him o'er the land.\r\n\r\n    O thought that swifter art than light,\r\n      That mightier art than tempest's roar!\r\n    Didst thou not raise me in thy flight,\r\n      What were my song, my minstrel lore,\r\n      And what the gold from _Minne's_ store?\r\n    Beyond the heights an eagle vaunts,\r\n    O bear me to the spirit's haunts!\"\r\n\r\nHis song meets with the approval of the knights, who give generous\r\nencouragement to the minstrel. Raising his eyes to the proud, beautiful\r\nmistress of the castle, he again strikes his lyre and sings:\r\n\r\n    \"Pure woman is to man a crown,\r\n    For her he strives to win renown.\r\n    Did she not grace and animate,\r\n    How mean and low the castle great!\r\n    By true companionship, the wife\r\n    Makes blithe and free a man's whole life;\r\n    Her light turns bright the darkest day.\r\n    Her praise and worth I'll sing alway.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady inclines her fair head in token of thanks, and the lord of\r\ncastle Trimberg fills the golden goblet, and hands it, the mark of\r\nhonor, to the poet, who drains it, and then modestly steps back into the\r\ncircle of his compeers. Now we have leisure to examine the rare man.--\r\n\r\nRuediger Manesse, a town councillor of Zuerich in the fourteenth century,\r\nraised a beautiful monument to bardic art in a manuscript work, executed\r\nat his order, containing the songs of one hundred and forty poets,\r\nliving between the twelfth and the fourteenth century. Among the authors\r\nare kings, princes, noblemen of high rank and low, burgher-poets, and\r\nthe Jew Suesskind von Trimberg. Each poet's productions are accompanied\r\nby illustrations, not authentic portraits, but a series of vivid\r\nrepresentations of scenes of knight-errantry. There are scenes of war\r\nand peace, of combats, the chase, and tourneys with games, songs, and\r\ndance. We see the storming of a castle of Love (_Minneburg_)--lovers\r\nfleeing, lovers separated, love triumphant. Heinrich von Veldeke\r\nreclines upon a bank of roses; Friedrich von Hausen is on board a boat;\r\nWalther von der Vogelweide sits musing on a wayside stone; Wolfram von\r\nEschenbach stands armed, with visor closed, next to his caparisoned\r\nhorse, as though about to mount. Among the portraits of the knights and\r\nbards is Suesskind von Trimberg's. How does Ruediger Manesse represent\r\nhim? As a long-bearded Jew, on his head a yellow, funnel-shaped hat, the\r\nbadge of distinction decreed by Pope Innocent III. to be worn by Jews.\r\nThat is all! and save what we may infer from his six poems preserved by\r\nthe history of literature, pretty much all, too, known of Suesskind von\r\nTrimberg.\r\n\r\nWas it the heedlessness of the compiler that associated the Jew with\r\nthis merry company, in which he was as much out of place as a Gothic\r\nspire on a synagogue? Suesskind came by the privilege fairly. Throughout\r\nthe middle ages the Jews of Germany were permeated with the culture of\r\ntheir native land, and were keenly concerned in the development of its\r\npoetry. A still more important circumstance is the spirit of tolerance\r\nand humanity that pervades Middle High German poetry. Wolfram von\r\nEschenbach based his _Parzival_, the herald of \"Nathan the Wise,\" on the\r\nidea of the brotherhood of man; Walther von der Vogelweide ranged\r\nChristians, Jews, and Mohammedans together as children of the one God;\r\nand Freidank, reflecting that God lets His sun shine on the confessors\r\nof all creeds, went so far as to repudiate the doctrine of the eternal\r\ndamnation of Jews. This trend of thought, characterizing both Jews and\r\nChristians, suffices to explain how, in Germany, and at the very time in\r\nwhich the teachers of the Church were reviling \"the mad Jews, who ought\r\nto be hewn down like dogs,\" it was possible for a Jew to be a\r\nminnesinger, a minstrel among minstrels, and abundantly accounts for\r\nSuesskind von Trimberg's association with knights and ladies. Suesskind,\r\nthen, doubtless journeyed with his brother-poets from castle to castle;\r\nyet our imagination would be leading us astray, were we to accept\r\nliterally the words of the enthusiastic historian Graetz, and with him\r\nbelieve that \"on vine-clad hills, seated in the circle of noble knights\r\nand fair dames, a beaker of wine at his side, his lyre in his hand, he\r\nsang his polished verses of love's joys and trials, love's hopes and\r\nfears, and then awaited the largesses that bought his daily bread.\"[46]\r\n\r\nSuesskind's poems are not at all like the joyous, rollicking songs his\r\nmates carolled forth; they are sad and serious, tender and chaste. Of\r\nlove there is not a word. A minnesinger and a Jew--irreconcilable\r\nopposites! A minnesinger must be a knight wooing his lady-love, whose\r\ncolors he wears at the tournaments, and for whose sake he undertakes a\r\npilgrimage to the Holy Land. The Jew's minstrelsy is a lament for Zion.\r\n\r\nIn fact what is _Minne_--this service of love? Is it not at bottom the\r\ncult of the Virgin Mary? Is it not, in a subtle, mysterious way, a phase\r\nof Christianity itself? How could it have appealed to the Jew Suesskind?\r\nTrue, the Jews, too, have an ideal of love in the \"Song of Songs\": \"Lo,\r\nthou art beautiful, my beloved!\" it says, but our old sages took the\r\nbeloved to be the Synagogue. Of this love Princess Sabbath is the ideal,\r\nand the passion of the \"Song of Songs\" is separated from German _Minne_\r\nby the great gap between the soul life of the Semite and that of the\r\nChristian German. Unbridled sensuousness surges through the songs rising\r\nto the chambers of noble ladies. Kabbalistic passion glows in the\r\nmysterious love of the Jew. The German minstrel sings of love's\r\nsweetness and pain, of summer and its delights, of winter and its woes,\r\nnow of joy and happiness, again of ill-starred fortunes. And what is the\r\nburden of the exiled Hebrew's song? Mysterious allusions, hidden in a\r\ntangle of highly polished, artificial, slow-moving rhymes, glorify, not\r\na sweet womanly presence, but a fleeting vision, a shadow, whose elusive\r\ncharms infatuated the poet in his dreams. Bright, joyous, blithe,\r\nunmeasured is the one; serious, gloomy, chaste, gentle, the other.\r\n\r\nYet, Suesskind von Trimberg was at once a Jew and a minnesinger. Who can\r\nfathom a poet's soul? Who can follow his thoughts as they fly hither and\r\nthither, like the thread in a weaver's shuttle, fashioning themselves\r\ninto a golden web? The minnesingers enlisted in love's cause, yet none\r\nthe less in war and the defense of truth, and for the last Suesskind von\r\nTrimberg did valiant service. The poems of his earliest period, the\r\nblithesome days of youth, have not survived. Those that we have bear the\r\nstamp of sorrow and trouble, the gifts of advanced years. With\r\nself-contemptuous bitterness, he bewails his sad lot:\r\n\r\n    \"I seek and nothing find,--\r\n    That makes me sigh and sigh.\r\n    Lord Lackfood presses me,\r\n    Of hunger sure I'll die;\r\n    My wife, my child go supperless,\r\n    My butler is Sir Meagreness.\"\r\n\r\nSuesskind von Trimberg's poems also breathe the spirit of Hebrew\r\nliterature, and have drawn material from the legend world of the\r\nHaggada. For the praise of his faithful wife he borrows the words of\r\nSolomon, and the psalm-like rhythm of his best songs recalls the\r\nfamiliar strains of our evening-prayer:\r\n\r\n    \"Almighty God! That shinest with the sun,\r\n    That slumb'rest not when day grows into night!\r\n    Thou Source of all, of tranquil peace and joy!\r\n    Thou King of glory and majestic light!\r\n    Thou allgood Father! Golden rays of day\r\n    And starry hosts thy praise to sing unite,\r\n    Creator of heav'n and earth, Eternal One,\r\n    That watchest ev'ry creature from Thy height!\"\r\n\r\nLike Santob, Suesskind was poor; like him, he denounced the rich, was\r\nproud and generous. With intrepid candor, he taught knights the meaning\r\nof true nobility--of the nobility of soul transcending nobility of\r\nbirth--and of freedom of thought--freedom fettered by neither stone, nor\r\nsteel, nor iron; and in the midst of their rioting and feasting, he\r\nventured to put before them the solemn thought of death. His last\r\nproduction as a minnesinger was a prescription for a \"virtue-electuary.\"\r\nThen he went to dwell among his brethren, whom, indeed, he had not\r\ndeserted in the pride of his youth:\r\n\r\n    \"Why should I wander sadly,\r\n      My harp within my hand,\r\n    O'er mountain, hill, and valley?\r\n      What praise do I command?\r\n\r\n    Full well they know the singer\r\n      Belongs to race accursed;\r\n    Sweet _Minne_ doth no longer\r\n      Reward me as at first.\r\n\r\n    Be silent, then, my lyre,\r\n      We sing 'fore lords in vain.\r\n    I'll leave the minstrels' choir,\r\n      And roam a Jew again.\r\n\r\n    My staff and hat I'll grasp, then,\r\n      And on my breast full low,\r\n    By Jewish custom olden\r\n      My grizzled beard shall grow.\r\n\r\n    My days I'll pass in quiet,--\r\n      Those left to me on earth--\r\n    Nor sing for those who not yet\r\n      Have learned a poet's worth.\"\r\n\r\nThus spake the Jewish poet, and dropped his lyre into the stream--in\r\nsong and in life, a worthy son of his time, the disciple of Walther von\r\nder Vogelweide, the friend of Wolfram von Eschenbach--disciple and\r\nfriend of the first to give utterance, in German song, to the idea of\r\nthe brotherhood of man. Centuries ago, he found the longed-for quiet in\r\nFranconia, but no wreath lies on his grave, no stone marks the\r\nwanderer's resting-place. His poems have found an abiding home in the\r\nmemory of posterity, and in the circle of the German minnesingers the\r\nJew Suesskind forms a distinct link.\r\n\r\nIn a time when the idea of universal human brotherhood seems to be\r\nfading from the hearts of men, when they manifest a proneness to forget\r\nthe share which, despite hatred and persecution, the Jew of every\r\ngeneration has had in German literature, in its romances of chivalry and\r\nits national epics, and in all the spiritual achievements of German\r\ngenius, we may with just pride revive Suesskind's memory.--\r\n\r\nOn the wings of fancy let us return to our castle on the Saale. After\r\nthe lapse of many years, the procession of poets again wends its way in\r\nthe sunshine up the slope to the proud mansion of the Trimbergs. The\r\nvenerable Walther von der Vogelweide again opens the festival of song.\r\nWolfram von Eschenbach, followed by a band of young disciples, musingly\r\nascends the mountain-side. The ranks grow less serried, and in solitude\r\nand sadness, advances a man of noble form, his silvery beard flowing\r\ndown upon his breast, a long cloak over his shoulder, and the peaked\r\nhat, the badge of the mediaeval Jew, on his head. In his eye gleams a ray\r\nof the poet's grace, and his meditative glance looks into a distant\r\nfuture. Suesskind von Trimberg, to thee our greeting!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMOR AND LOVE IN JEWISH POETRY\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable discoveries of the last ten years is that\r\nmade in Paris by M. Ernest Renan. He maintains as the result of\r\nscientific research that the Semitic races, consequently also the Jews,\r\nare lacking in humor, in the capacity for laughter. The justice of the\r\nreproach might be denied outright, but a statement enunciated with so\r\nmuch scientific assurance involuntarily prompts questioning and\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nIn such cases the Jews invariably resort to their first text-book, the\r\nBible, whose pages seem to sustain M. Renan. In the Bible laughing is\r\nmentioned only twice, when the angel promises a son to Sarah, and again\r\nin the history of Samson, judge in Israel, who used foxes' tails as\r\nweapons against the Philistines. These are the only passages in which\r\nthe Bible departs from its serious tone.\r\n\r\nBut classical antiquity was equally ignorant of humor as a distinct\r\nbranch of art, as a peculiar attitude of the mind towards the problems\r\nof life. Aristophanes lived and could have written only in the days when\r\nAthenian institutions began to decay. It is personal discomfort and the\r\ntrials and harassments of life that drive men to the ever serene, pure\r\nregions of humor for balm and healing. Fun and comedy men have at all\r\ntimes understood--the history of Samson contains the germs of a\r\nmock-heroic poem--while it was impossible for humor, genuine humor, to\r\nfind appreciation in the youth of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn those days of healthy reliance upon the senses, poetic spirits could\r\nobtain satisfaction only in love and in the praise of the good world and\r\nits Maker. The sombre line of division had not yet been introduced\r\nbetween the physical and the spiritual world, debasing this earth to a\r\nvale of tears, and consoling sinful man by the promise of a better land,\r\nwhose manifold delights were described, but about which there was no\r\nprecise knowledge, no traveller, as the Talmud aptly puts it, having\r\never returned to give us information about it. Those were the days of\r\nperfect harmony, when man crept close to nature to be taught untroubled\r\njoy in living. In such days, despite the storms assailing the young\r\nIsraelitish nation, a poet, his heart filled with the sunshine of joy,\r\nhis mind receptive, his eyes open wide to see the flowers unfold, the\r\nbuds of the fig tree swell, the vine put forth leaves, and the\r\npomegranate blossom unfurl its glowing petals, could carol forth the\r\n\"Song of Songs,\" the most perfect, the most beautiful, the purest\r\ncreation of Hebrew literature and the erotic poetry of all\r\nliteratures--the song of songs of stormy passion, bidding defiance to\r\necclesiastical fetters, at once an epic and a drama, full of childlike\r\ntenderness and grace of feeling. Neither Greece, nor the rest of the\r\nOrient has produced anything to compare with its marvellous union of\r\nvoluptuous sensuousness and immaculate chastity. Morality, indeed, is\r\nits very pulse-beat. It could be sung only in an age when love reigned\r\nsupreme, and could presume to treat humor as a pretender. So lofty a\r\nsong was bound to awaken echoes and stimulate imitation, and its music\r\nhas flowed down through the centuries, weaving a thread of melody about\r\nthe heart of many a poet.\r\n\r\nThe centuries of Israelitish history close upon its composition,\r\nhowever, were favorable to neither the poetry of love nor that of humor.\r\nBut the poetry of love must have continued to exercise puissant magic\r\nover hearts and minds, if its supreme poem not only was made part of the\r\nholy canon, but was considered by a teacher of the Talmud the most\r\nsacred treasure of the compilation.\r\n\r\nThe blood of the Maccabean heroes victorious over Antiochus Epiphanes\r\nagain fructified the old soil of Hebrew poetry, and charmed forth\r\nfragrant blossoms, the psalms designated as Maccabean by modern\r\ncriticism. Written in troublous times, they contain a reference to the\r\nhumor of the future: \"When the Lord bringeth back again the captivity of\r\nZion, then shall we be like dreamers, then shall our mouth be filled\r\nwith laughter, and our tongue with singing.\"\r\n\r\nMany sad days were destined to pass over Israel before that future with\r\nits solacement of humor dawned. No poetic work could obtain recognition\r\nnext to the Bible. The language of the prophets ceased to be the\r\nlanguage of the people, and every mind was occupied with interpreting\r\ntheir words and applying them to the religious needs of the hour. The\r\nopposition between Jewish and Hellenic-Syrian views became more and more\r\nmarked. Hellas and Judaea, the two great theories of life supporting the\r\nfabric of civilization, for the first time confronted each other. An\r\nancient expounder of the Bible says that to Hellas God gave beauty in\r\nthe beginning, to Judaea truth, as a sacred heritage. But beauty and\r\ntruth have ever been inveterate foes; even now they are not reconciled.\r\n\r\nIn Judaea and Greece, ancient civilization found equally perfect, yet\r\ntotally different, expression. The Greek worships nature as she is; the\r\nJew dwells upon the origin and development of created things, hence\r\nworships their Creator. The former in his speculations proceeds from the\r\nmultiplicity of phenomena; the latter discerns the unity of the plan. To\r\nthe former the universe was changeless actuality; to the latter it meant\r\nunending development. The world, complete and perfect, was mirrored in\r\nthe Greek mind; its evolution, in the Jewish. Therefore the Jewish\r\nconception of life is harmonious, while among the Greeks grew up the\r\nspirit of doubt and speculation, the product of civilization, and the\r\nsoil upon which humor disports.\r\n\r\nIsrael's religion so completely satisfied every spiritual craving that\r\nno room was left for the growth of the poetic instinct. Intellectual\r\nlife began to divide into two great streams. The Halacha continued the\r\ninstruction of the prophets, as the Haggada fostered the spirit of the\r\npsalmists. The province of the former was to formulate the Law, of the\r\nlatter to plant a garden about the bulwark of the Law. While the one\r\naddressed itself to reason, the other made an appeal to the heart and\r\nthe feelings. In the Haggada, a thesaurus of the national poetry by the\r\nnameless poets of many centuries, we find epic poems and lyric\r\noutbursts, fables, enigmas, and dramatic essays, and here and there in\r\nthis garden we chance across a little bud of humorous composition.\r\n\r\nOf what sort was this humor? In point of fact, what is humor? We must be\r\nable to answer the latter question before we may venture to classify the\r\nfolklore of the Haggada.\r\n\r\nTo reach the ideal, to bring harmony out of discord, is the recognized\r\ntask of all art. This is the primary principle to be borne in mind in\r\naesthetic criticism. Tragedy idealizes the world by annihilation,\r\nharmonizes all contradictions by dashing them in pieces against each\r\nother, and points the way of escape from chaos, across the bridge of\r\ndeath, to the realm beyond, irradiated by the perpetual morning-dawn of\r\nfreedom and intellect.\r\n\r\nComedy, on the other hand, believes that the incongruities and\r\nimperfections of life can be justified, and have their uses. Firmly\r\nconvinced of the might of truth, it holds that the folly and aberrations\r\nof men, their shortcomings and failings, cannot impede its eventual\r\nvictory. Even in them it sees traces of an eternal, divine principle.\r\nWhile tragedy precipitates the conflict of hostile forces, comedy,\r\nrising serene above folly and all indications of transitoriness,\r\nreconciles inconsistencies, and lovingly coaxes them into harmony with\r\nthe true and the absolute.\r\n\r\nWhen man's spirit is thus made to re-enter upon the enjoyment of eternal\r\ntruth, its heritage, there is, as some one has well said, triumph akin\r\nto the joy of the father over the home-coming of a lost son, and the\r\ndivine, refreshing laughter by which it is greeted is like the meal\r\nprepared for the returning favorite. Is Israel to have no seat at the\r\ntable? Israel, the first to recognize that the eternal truths of life\r\nare innate in man, the first to teach, as his chief message, how to\r\nreconcile man with himself and the world, whenever these truths suffer\r\ntemporary obscuration? So viewed, humor is the offspring of love, and\r\nalso mankind's redeemer, inasmuch as it paralyzes the influence of anger\r\nand hatred, emanations from the powers of change and finality, by laying\r\nbare the eternal principles and \"sweet reasonableness\" hidden even in\r\nthem, and finally stripping them of every adjunct incompatible with the\r\nserenity of absolute truth. In whatever mind humor, that is, love and\r\ncheerfulness, reigns supreme, the inconsistencies and imperfections of\r\nlife, all that bears the impress of mutability, will gently and\r\ngradually be fused into the harmonious perfection of absolute, eternal\r\ntruth. Mists sometimes gather about the sun, but unable to extinguish\r\nhis light, they are forced to serve as his mirror, on which he throws\r\nthe witching charms of the Fata Morgana. So, when the eternal truths of\r\nlife are veiled, opportunity is made for humor to play upon and\r\nirradiate them. In precise language, humor is a state of perfect\r\nself-certainty, in which the mind serenely rises superior to every petty\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\nThis placidity shed its soft light into the modest academies of the\r\nrabbis. Wherever a ray fell, a blossom of Haggadic folklore sprang up.\r\nEvery occurrence in life recommends itself to their loving scrutiny:\r\npleasures and follies of men, curse turned into blessing, the ordinary\r\ncourse of human events, curiosities of Israel's history and mankind's.\r\nAs instances of their method, take what Midrashic folklore has to say\r\nconcerning the creation of the two things of perennial interest to\r\npoets: wife and wine.\r\n\r\nWhen the Lord God created woman, he formed her not from the head of man,\r\nlest she be too proud; not from his eye, lest she be too coquettish; not\r\nfrom his ear, lest she be too curious; not from his mouth, lest she be\r\ntoo talkative; not from his heart, lest she be too sentimental; not from\r\nhis hands, lest she be too officious; nor from his feet, lest she be an\r\nidle gadabout; but from a subordinate part of man's anatomy, to teach\r\nher: \"Woman, be thou modest!\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to the vine, the Haggada tells us that when Father Noah was\r\nabout to plant the first one, Satan stepped up to him, leading a lamb, a\r\nlion, a pig, and an ape, to teach him that so long as man does not drink\r\nwine, he is innocent as a lamb; if he drinks temperately, he is as\r\nstrong as a lion; if he indulges too freely, he sinks to the level of\r\nswine; and as for the ape, his place in the poetry of wine is as well\r\nknown to us as to the rabbis of old.\r\n\r\nWith the approach of the great catastrophe destined to annihilate\r\nIsrael's national existence, humor and spontaneity vanish, to be\r\nsuperseded by seriousness, melancholy, and bitter plaints, and the\r\ncenturies of despondency and brooding that followed it were not better\r\ncalculated to encourage the expression of love and humor. The pall was\r\nnot lifted until the Haggada performed its mission as a comforter. Under\r\nits gentle ministrations, and urged into vitality by the religious needs\r\nof the synagogue, the poetic instinct awoke. _Piut_ and _Selicha_\r\nreplaced prophecy and psalmody as religious agents, and thenceforth the\r\nsprings of consolation were never permitted to run dry. Driven from the\r\nshores of the Jordan and the Euphrates, Hebrew poetry found a new home\r\non the Tagus and the Manzanares, where the Jews were blessed with a\r\nsecond golden age. In the interval from the eleventh to the thirteenth\r\ncentury, under genial Arabic influences, Andalusian masters of song\r\nbuilt up an ideal world of poetry, wherein love and humor were granted\r\nuntrammelled liberty.\r\n\r\nTo the Spanish-Jewish writers poetry was an end in itself. Along with\r\nreligious songs, perfect in rhythm and form, they produced lyrics on\r\nsecular subjects, whose grace, beauty, harmony, and wealth of thought\r\nrank them with the finest creations of the age. The spirit of the\r\nprophets and psalmists revived in these Spanish poets. At their head\r\nstands Solomon ibn Gabirol, the Faust of Saragossa, whose poems are the\r\nfirst tinged with _Weltschmerz_, that peculiar ferment characteristic of\r\na modern school of poets.[47] Our accounts of Gabirol's life are meagre,\r\nbut they leave the clear impression that he was not a favorite of\r\nfortune, and passed a bleak childhood and youth. His poems are pervaded\r\nby vain longing for the ideal, by lamentations over deceived hopes and\r\nunfulfilled aspirations, by painful realization of the imperfection and\r\nperishability of all earthly things, and the insignificance and\r\ntransitoriness of life, in a word, by _Weltschmerz_, in its purest,\r\nideal form, not merely self-deception and irony turned against one's own\r\nsoul life, but a profoundly solemn emotion, springing from sublime pity\r\nfor the misery of the world read by the light of personal trials and\r\nsorrows. He sang not of a mistress' blue eyes, nor sighed forth\r\nmelancholy love-notes--the object of his heart's desire was Zion, his\r\nmuse the fair \"rose of Sharon,\" and his anguish was for the suffering of\r\nhis scattered people. Strong, wild words fitly express his tempestuous\r\nfeelings. He is a proud, solitary thinker. Often his _Weltschmerz_\r\nwrests scornful criticism of his surroundings from him. On the other\r\nhand, he does not lack mild, conciliatory humor, of which his famous\r\ndrinking-song is a good illustration. His miserly host had put a single\r\nbottle of wine upon a table surrounded by many guests, who had to have\r\nrecourse to water to quench their thirst. Wine he calls a\r\nseptuagenarian, the letters of the Hebrew word for wine (_yayin_)\r\nrepresenting seventy, and water a nonagenarian, because _mayim_ (water)\r\nrepresents ninety:\r\n\r\nWATER SONG\r\n\r\nChorus:--Of wine, alas! there's not a drop,\r\n         Our host has filled our goblets to the top\r\n                 With water.\r\n\r\n         When monarch wine lies prone,\r\n         By water overthrown,\r\n         How can a merry song be sung?\r\n         For naught there is to wet our tongue\r\n                 But water.\r\n           CHORUS:--Of wine, alas! etc.\r\n\r\n         No sweetmeats can delight\r\n         My dainty appetite,\r\n         For I, alas! must learn to drink,\r\n         However I may writhe and shrink,\r\n                 Pure water.\r\n           CHORUS:--Of wine, alas! etc.\r\n\r\n         Give Moses praise, for he\r\n         Made waterless a sea--\r\n         Mine host to quench my thirst--the churl!--\r\n         Makes streams of clearest water purl,\r\n                 Of water.\r\n           CHORUS:--Of wine, alas! etc.\r\n\r\n         To toads I feel allied,\r\n         To frogs by kinship tied;\r\n         For water drinking is no joke,\r\n         Ere long you all will hear me croak\r\n                 Quack water!\r\n           CHORUS:--Of wine, alas! etc.\r\n\r\n         May God our host requite;\r\n         May he turn Nazirite,\r\n         Ne'er know intoxication's thrill,\r\n         Nor e'er succeed his thirst to still\r\n                 With water!\r\n           CHORUS:--Of wine, alas! etc.\"\r\n\r\nGabirol was a bold thinker, a great poet wrestling with the deepest\r\nproblems of human thought, and towering far above his contemporaries and\r\nimmediate successors. In his time synagogue poetry reached the zenith of\r\nperfection, and even in the solemn admonitions of ritualistic\r\nliterature, humor now and again asserted itself. One of Gabirol's\r\ncontemporaries or successors, Isaac ben Yehuda ibn Ghayyat, for\r\ninstance, often made his whole poem turn upon a witticism.\r\n\r\nAmong the writers of that age, a peculiar style called \"mosaic\"\r\ngradually grew up, and eventually became characteristic of neo-Hebraic\r\npoetry and humor. For their subjects and the presentation of their\r\nthoughts, they habitually made use of biblical phraseology, either as\r\ndirect quotations or with an application not intended by the original\r\ncontext. In the latter case, well-known sentences were invested with new\r\nmeanings, and this poetic-biblical phraseology afforded countless\r\nopportunities for the exercise of humor, of which neo-Hebraic poetry\r\navailed itself freely. The \"mosaics\" were collected not only from the\r\nBible; the Targum, the Mishna, and the Talmud were rifled of sententious\r\nexpressions, woven together, and with the license of art placed in\r\nunexpected juxtaposition. An example will make clear the method. In\r\nGenesis xviii. 29, God answers Abraham's petition in behalf of Sodom\r\nwith the words: \"I will not do it for the sake of forty,\" meaning, as\r\neverybody knows, that forty men would suffice to save the city from\r\ndestruction. This passage Isaac ben Yehuda ibn Ghayyat audaciously\r\nconnects with Deuteronomy xxv. 3, where forty is also mentioned, the\r\nforty stripes for misdemeanors of various kinds:\r\n\r\n    \"If you see men the path of right forsake,\r\n    To bring them back you must an effort make.\r\n    Perhaps, if they but hear of stripes, they'll quake,\r\n    And say, 'I'll do it not for forty's sake.'\"\r\n\r\nThis \"mosaic\" style, suggesting startling contrasts and surprising\r\napplications of Bible thoughts and words, became a fruitful source of\r\nJewish humor. If a theory of literary descent could be established, an\r\nillustration might be found in Heine's rapid transitions from tender\r\nsentiment to corroding wit, a modern development of the flashing humor\r\nof the \"mosaic\" style.\r\n\r\nThe \"Song of Songs\" naturally became a treasure-house of \"mosaic\"\r\nsuggestions for the purposes of neo-Hebraic love poetry, which was\r\ndominated, however, by Arab influences. The first poet to introduce the\r\nsorrow of unhappy love into neo-Hebraic poetry was Moses ibn Ezra. He\r\nwas in love with his niece, who probably became the wife of one of his\r\nbrothers, and died early on giving birth to a son. His affection at\r\nfirst was requited, but his brothers opposed the union, and the poet\r\nleft Spain, embittered and out of sorts with fate, to find peace and\r\nconsolation in distant lands. Many of his poems are deeply tinged with\r\ngloom and pessimism, and the natural inference is that those in which he\r\npraises nature, and wine, and \"bacchanalian feasts under leafy canopies\r\nwith merry minstrelsy of birds\" belong to the period of his life\r\npreceding its unfortunate turning-point, when love still smiled upon\r\nhim, and hope was strong.\r\n\r\nSome of his poems may serve as typical specimens of the love-poetry of\r\nthose days:\r\n\r\n    \"With hopeless love my heart is sick,\r\n      Confession bursts my lips' restraint\r\n    That thou, my love, dost cast me off,\r\n      Hath touched me with a death-like taint.\r\n\r\n    I view the land both near and far,\r\n      To me it seems a prison vast.\r\n    Throughout its breadth, where'er I look,\r\n      My eyes are met by doors locked fast.\r\n\r\n    And though the world stood open wide,\r\n      Though angel hosts filled ev'ry space,\r\n    To me 'twere destitute of charm\r\n      Didst thou withdraw thy face.\"\r\n\r\nHere is another:\r\n\r\n    \"Perchance in days to come,\r\n      When men and all things change,\r\n    They'll marvel at my love,\r\n      And call it passing strange.\r\n\r\n    Without I seem most calm,\r\n      But fires rage within--\r\n    'Gainst me, as none before,\r\n      Thou didst a grievous sin.\r\n\r\n    What! tell the world my woe!\r\n      That were exceeding vain.\r\n    With mocking smile they'd say,\r\n      'You know, he is not sane!'\"\r\n\r\nWhen his lady-love died, he composed the following elegy:\r\n\r\n    \"In pain she bore the son who her embrace\r\n      Would never know. Relentless death spread straight\r\n      His nets for her, and she, scarce animate,\r\n    Unto her husband signed: I ask this grace,\r\n    My friend, let not harsh death our love efface;\r\n      To our babes, its pledges, dedicate\r\n      Thy faithful care; for vainly they await\r\n    A mother's smile each childish fear to chase.\r\n    And to my uncle, prithee, write. Deep pain\r\n      I brought his heart. Consumed by love's regret\r\n    He roved, a stranger in his home. I fain\r\n      Would have him shed a tear, nor love forget.\r\n    He seeketh consolation's cup, but first\r\n    His soul with bitterness must quench its thirst.\"\r\n\r\nMoses ibn Ezra's cup of consolation on not a few occasions seems to have\r\nbeen filled to overflowing with wine. In no other way can the joyousness\r\nof his drinking-songs be accounted for. The following are\r\ncharacteristic:\r\n\r\n    \"Wine cooleth man in summer's heat,\r\n    And warmeth him in winter's sleet.\r\n    My buckler 'tis 'gainst chilling frost,\r\n    My shield when rays of sun exhaust.\"\r\n\r\n    \"If men will probe their inmost heart,\r\n    They must condemn their crafty art:\r\n    For silver pieces they make bold\r\n    To ask a drink of liquid gold.\"\r\n\r\nTo his mistress, naturally, many a stanza of witty praise and coaxing\r\nimagery was devoted:\r\n\r\n    \"My love is like a myrtle tree,\r\n      When at the dance her hair falls down.\r\n    Her eyes deal death most pitiless,\r\n      Yet who would dare on her to frown?\"\r\n\r\n    \"Said I to sweetheart: 'Why dost thou resent\r\n      The homage to thy grace by old men paid?'\r\n    She answered me with question pertinent:\r\n      'Dost thou prefer a widow to a maid?'\"\r\n\r\nTo his love-poems and drinking-songs must be added his poems of\r\nfriendship, on true friends, life's crowning gift, and false friends,\r\nbasest of creatures. He has justly been described as the most subjective\r\nof neo-Hebraic poets. His blithe delight in love, exhaling from his\r\npoems, transfigured his ready humor, which instinctively pierced to the\r\nludicrous element in every object and occurrence: age dyeing its hair,\r\ntraitorous friendship, the pride of wealth, or separation of lovers.\r\n\r\nYet in the history of synagogue literature this poet goes by the name\r\n_Ha-Sallach_, \"penitential poet,\" on account of his many religious\r\nsongs, bewailing in elegiac measure the hollowness of life, and the\r\nvanity of earthly possessions, and in ardent words advocating humility,\r\nrepentance, and a contrite heart. The peculiarity of Jewish humor is\r\nthat it returns to its tragic source.\r\n\r\nNo mediaeval poet so markedly illustrates this characteristic as the\r\nprince of neo-Hebraic poetry, Yehuda Halevi, in whose poems the\r\nprinciple of Jewish national poesy attained its completest expression.\r\nThey are the idealized reflex of the soul of the Jewish people, its\r\npoetic emotions, its \"making for righteousness,\" its patriotic love of\r\nrace, its capacity for martyrdom. Whatever true and beautiful element\r\nhad developed in Jewish soul life, since the day when Judah's song first\r\nrang out in Zion's accents on Spanish soil, greets us in its noblest\r\ngarb in his poetry. A modern poet[48] says of him:\r\n\r\n    \"Ay, he was a master singer,\r\n    Brilliant pole star of his age,\r\n    Light and beacon to his people!\r\n    Wondrous mighty was his singing--\r\n\r\n    Verily a fiery pillar\r\n    Moving on 'fore Israel's legions,\r\n    Restless caravan of sorrow,\r\n    Through the exile's desert plain.\"\r\n\r\nIn his early youth the muse of poetry had imprinted a kiss upon Halevi's\r\nbrow, and the gracious echo of that kiss trembles through all the poet's\r\nnumbers. Love, too, seems early to have taken up an abode in his\r\nsusceptible heart, but, as expressed in the poems of his youth, it is\r\nnot sensuous, earthly love, nor Gabirol's despondency and unselfish\r\ngrief, nor even the sentiment of Moses ibn Ezra's artistically\r\nconceived and technically perfect love-plaint. It is tender, yet\r\npassionate, frankly extolling the happiness of requited love, and as\r\nnaively miserable over separation from his mistress, whom he calls Ophra\r\n(fawn). One of his sweetest songs he puts upon her lips:\r\n\r\n    \"Into my eyes he loving looked,\r\n      My arms about his neck were twined,\r\n    And in the mirror of my eyes,\r\n      What but his image did he find?\r\n\r\n    Upon my dark-hued eyes he pressed\r\n      His lips with breath of passion rare.\r\n    The rogue! 'Twas not my eyes he kissed;\r\n      He kissed his picture mirrored there.\"\r\n\r\nOphra's \"Song of Joy\" reminds one of the passion of the \"Song of Songs\":\r\n\r\n    \"He cometh, O bliss!\r\n    Fly swiftly, ye winds,\r\n    Ye odorous breezes,\r\n    And tell him how long\r\n    I've waited for this!\r\n\r\n    O happy that night,\r\n    When sunk on thy breast,\r\n    Thy kisses fast falling,\r\n    And drunken with love,\r\n    My troth I did plight.\r\n\r\n    Again my sweet friend\r\n    Embraceth me close.\r\n    Yes, heaven doth bless us,\r\n    And now thou hast won\r\n    My love without end.\"\r\n\r\nHis mistress' charms he describes with attractive grace:\r\n\r\n    \"My sweetheart's dainty lips are red,\r\n    With ruby's crimson overspread;\r\n    Her teeth are like a string of pearls;\r\n    Adown her neck her clust'ring curls\r\n    In ebon hue vie with the night;\r\n    And o'er her features dances light.\r\n\r\n    The twinkling stars enthroned above\r\n    Are sisters to my dearest love.\r\n    We men should count it joy complete\r\n    To lay our service at her feet.\r\n    But ah! what rapture in her kiss!\r\n    A forecast 'tis of heav'nly bliss!\"\r\n\r\nWhen the hour of parting from Ophra came, the young poet sang:\r\n\r\n    \"And so we twain must part! Oh linger yet,\r\n      Let me still feed my glance upon thine eyes.\r\n    Forget not, love, the days of our delight,\r\n      And I our nights of bliss shall ever prize.\r\n    In dreams thy shadowy image I shall see,\r\n      Oh even in my dream be kind to me!\"[49]\r\n\r\nYehuda Halevi sang not only of love, but also, in true Oriental fashion,\r\nand under the influence of his Arabic models, of wine and friendship. On\r\nthe other hand, he is entirely original in his epithalamiums, charming\r\ndescriptions of the felicity of young conjugal life and the sweet\r\nblessings of pure love. They are pervaded by the intensity of joy, and\r\nfull of roguish allusions to the young wife's shamefacedness, arousing\r\nthe jest and merriment of her guests, and her delicate shrinking in the\r\npresence of longed-for happiness. Characteristically enough his\r\nadmonitions to feed the fire of love are always followed by a sigh for\r\nhis people's woes:\r\n\r\n    \"You twain will soon be one,\r\n      And all your longing filled.\r\n    Ah me! will Israel's hope\r\n      For freedom e'er be stilled?\"\r\n\r\nIt is altogether probable that these blithesome songs belong to the\r\npoet's early life. To a friend who remonstrates with him for his love of\r\nwine he replies:\r\n\r\n    \"My years scarce number twenty-one--\r\n    Wouldst have me now the wine-cup shun?\"\r\n\r\nwhich would seem to indicate that love and wine were the pursuits of his\r\nyouth. One of his prettiest drinking songs is the following:\r\n\r\n    \"My bowl yields exultation--\r\n      I soar aloft on song-tipped wing,\r\n    Each draught is inspiration,\r\n      My lips sip wine, my mouth must sing.\r\n\r\n    Dear friends are full of horror,\r\n      Predict a toper's end for me.\r\n    They ask: 'How long, O sorrow,\r\n      Wilt thou remain wine's devotee?'\r\n\r\n    Why should I not sing praise of drinking?\r\n      The joys of Eden it makes mine.\r\n    If age will bring no cowardly shrinking,\r\n      Full many a year will I drink wine.\"\r\n\r\nBut little is known of the events of the poet's career. History's\r\nniggardliness, however, has been compensated for by the prodigality of\r\nlegend, which has woven many a fanciful tale about his life. Of one fact\r\nwe are certain: when he had passed his fiftieth year, Yehuda Halevi left\r\nhis native town, his home, his family, his friends, and disciples, to\r\nmake a pilgrimage to Palestine, the land wherein his heart had always\r\ndwelt. His itinerary can be traced in his songs. They lead us to Egypt,\r\nto Zoan, to Damascus. In Tyre silence suddenly falls upon the singer.\r\nDid he attain the goal he had set out to reach? Did his eye behold the\r\nland of his fathers? Or did death overtake the pilgrim singer before his\r\njourney's end? Legend which has beautified his life has transfigured his\r\ndeath. It is said, that struck by a Saracen's horse Yehuda Halevi sank\r\ndown before the very gates of Jerusalem. With its towers and battlements\r\nin sight, and his inspired \"Lay of Zion\" on his lips, his pure soul\r\nwinged its flight heavenward.\r\n\r\nWith the death of Yehuda Halevi, the golden age of neo-Hebraic poetry in\r\nSpain came to an end, and the period of the epigones was inaugurated. A\r\nnote of hesitancy is discernible in their productions, and they\r\nacknowledge the superiority of their predecessors in the epithet\r\n\"fathers of song\" applied to them. The most noted of the later writers\r\nwas Yehuda ben Solomon Charisi. Fortune marked him out to be the critic\r\nof the great poetic creations of the brilliant epoch just closed, and\r\nhis fame rests upon the skill with which he acquitted himself of his\r\ndifficult task. As for his poetry, it lacks the depth, the glow, the\r\nvirility, and inspiration of the works of the classical period. He was a\r\nrestless wanderer, a poet tramp, roving in the Orient, in Africa, and in\r\nEurope. His most important work is his divan _Tachkemoni_, testifying to\r\nhis powers as a humorist, and especially to his mastery of the Hebrew\r\nlanguage, which he uses with dexterity never excelled. The divan touches\r\nupon every possible subject: God and nature, human life and suffering,\r\nthe relations between men, his personal experiences, and his adventures\r\nin foreign parts. The first Makamat[50] writer among Jews, he furnished\r\nthe model for all poems of the kind that followed; their first genuine\r\nhumorist, he flashes forth his wit like a stream of light suddenly\r\nturned on in the dark. That he measured the worth of his productions by\r\nthe generous meed of praise given by his contemporaries is a venial\r\noffense in the time of the troubadours and minnesingers. Charisi was\r\nparticularly happy in his use of the \"mosaic\" style, and his short poems\r\nand epigrams are most charming. Deep melancholy is a foil to his humor,\r\nbut as often his writings are disfigured by levity. The following may\r\nserve as samples of his versatile muse. The first is addressed to his\r\ngrey hair:\r\n\r\n    \"Those ravens black that rested\r\n      Erstwhile upon my head,\r\n    Within my heart have nested,\r\n      Since from my hair they fled.\"\r\n\r\nThe second is inscribed to love's tears:\r\n\r\n    \"Within my heart I held concealed\r\n      My love so tender and so true;\r\n    But overflowing tears revealed\r\n      What I would fain have hid from view.\r\n    My heart could evermore repress\r\n    The woe that tell-tale tears confess.\"\r\n\r\nCharisi is at his best when he gives the rein to his humor. Sparks fly;\r\nhe stops at no caustic witticism, recoils from no satire; he is malice\r\nitself, and puts no restraint upon his levity. The \"Flea Song\" is a\r\ntypical illustration of his impish mood:\r\n\r\n    \"You ruthless flea, who desecrate my couch,\r\n      And draw my blood to sate your appetite,\r\n    You know not rest, on Sabbath day or feast--\r\n      Your feast it is when you can pinch and bite.\r\n\r\n    My friends expound the law: to kill a flea\r\n      Upon the Sabbath day a sin they call;\r\n    But I prefer that other law which says,\r\n      Be sure a murd'rer's malice to forestall.\"\r\n\r\nThat Charisi was a boon companion is evident from the following drinking\r\nsong:\r\n\r\n    \"Here under leafy bowers,\r\n      Where coolest shades descend,\r\n    Crowned with a wreath of flowers,\r\n      Here will we drink, my friend.\r\n\r\n    Who drinks of wine, he learns\r\n      That noble spirits' strength\r\n    But steady increase earns,\r\n      As years stretch out in length.\r\n\r\n    A thousand earthly years\r\n      Are hours in God's sight,\r\n    A year in heav'n appears\r\n      A minute in its flight.\r\n\r\n    I would this lot were mine:\r\n      To live by heav'nly count,\r\n    And drink and drink old wine\r\n      At youth's eternal fount.\"\r\n\r\nCharisi and his Arabic models found many imitators among Spanish Jews.\r\nSolomon ibn Sakbel wrote Hebrew Makamat which may be regarded as an\r\nattempt at a satire in the form of a romance. The hero, Asher ben\r\nYehuda, a veritable Don Juan, passes through most remarkable\r\nadventures.[51] The introductory Makama, describing life with his\r\nmistress in the solitude of a forest, is delicious. Tired of his\r\nmonotonous life, he joins a company of convivial fellows, who pass their\r\ntime in carousal. While with them, he receives an enigmatic love letter\r\nsigned by an unknown woman, and he sets out to find her. On his\r\nwanderings, oppressed by love's doubts, he chances into a harem, and is\r\nthreatened with death by its master. It turns out that the pasha is a\r\nbeautiful woman, the slave of his mysterious lady-love, and she promises\r\nhim speedy fulfilment of his wishes. Finally, close to the attainment of\r\nhis end, he discovers that his beauty is a myth, the whole a practical\r\njoke perpetrated by his merry companions. So Asher ben Yehuda in quest\r\nof his mistress is led from adventure to adventure.\r\n\r\nInternal evidence testifies against the genuineness of this romance, but\r\nat the same time with it appeared two other mock-heroic poems, \"The Book\r\nof Diversions\" (_Sefer Sha'ashuim_) by Joseph ibn Sabara, and \"The Gift\r\nof Judah the Misogynist\" (_Minchatk Yehuda Soneh ha-Nashim_) by Judah\r\nibn Sabbatai, a Cordova physician, whose poems Charisi praised as the\r\n\"fount of poesy.\" The plot of his \"Gift,\" a satire on women, is as\r\nfollows:[52] His dying father exacts from Serach, the hero of the\r\nromance, a promise never to marry, women in his sight being the cause of\r\nall the evil in the world. Curious as the behest is, it is still more\r\ncurious that Serach uncomplainingly complies, and most curious of all,\r\nthat he finds three companions willing to retire with him to a distant\r\nisland, whence their propaganda for celibacy is to proceed. Scarcely has\r\nthe news of their arrival spread, when a mass meeting of women is\r\ncalled, and a coalition formed against the misogynists. Korbi, an old\r\nhag, engages to make Serach faithless to his principles. He soon has a\r\nfalling out with his fellow-celibates, and succumbs to the fascinations\r\nof a fair young temptress. After the wedding he discovers that his\r\nenemies, the women, have substituted for his beautiful bride, a hideous\r\nold woman, Blackcoal, the daughter of Owl. She at once assumes the reins\r\nof government most energetically, and answers her husband's groan of\r\ndespair by the following curtain lecture:\r\n\r\n    \"Up! up! the time for sleep is past!\r\n    And no resistance will I brook!\r\n    Away with thee, and look to it\r\n    That thou bringst me what I ask:\r\n    Gowns of costly stuff,\r\n    Earrings, chains, and veils;\r\n    A house with many windows;\r\n    Mortars, lounges, sieves,\r\n    Baskets, kettles, pots,\r\n    Glasses, settles, brooms,\r\n    Beakers, closets, flasks,\r\n    Shovels, basins, bowls,\r\n    Spindle, distaff, blankets,\r\n    Buckets, ewers, barrels,\r\n    Skillets, forks, and knives;\r\n    Vinaigrettes and mirrors;\r\n    Kerchiefs, turbans, reticules,\r\n    Crescents, amulets,\r\n    Rings and jewelled clasps;\r\n    Girdles, buckles, bodices,\r\n    Kirtles, caps, and waists;\r\n    Garments finely spun,\r\n    Rare byssus from the East.\r\n    This and more shalt thou procure,\r\n    No matter at what cost and sacrifice.\r\n    Thou art affrighted? Thou weepest?\r\n    My dear, spare all this agitation;\r\n    Thou'lt suffer more than this.\r\n    The first year shall pass in strife,\r\n    The second will see thee a beggar.\r\n    A prince erstwhile, thou shalt become a slave;\r\n    Instead of a crown, thou shalt wear a wreath of straw.\"\r\n\r\nSerach in abject despair turns for comfort to his three friends, and it\r\nis decided to bring suit for divorce in a general assembly. The women\r\nappear at the meeting, and demand that the despiser of their sex be\r\nforced to keep his ugly wife. One of the trio of friends proposes that\r\nthe matter be brought before the king. The poet appends no moral to his\r\ntale; he leaves it to his readers to say: \"And such must be the fate of\r\nall woman-haters!\"\r\n\r\nJudah Sabbatai was evidently far from being a woman-hater himself, but\r\nsome of his contemporaries failed to understand the point of his\r\nwitticisms and ridiculous situations. Yedaya Penini, another poet,\r\nlooked upon it as a serious production, and in his allegory, \"Woman's\r\nFriend,\" destitute of poetic inspiration, but brilliant in dialectics,\r\nundertook the defense of the fair sex against the misanthropic\r\naspersions of the woman-hater.\r\n\r\nSuch works are evidence that we have reached the age of the troubadours\r\nand minnesingers, the epoch of the Renaissance, when, under the blue sky\r\nof Italy, and the fostering care of the trio of master-poets, Dante,\r\nPetrarch, and Boccaccio, the first germs of popular poetry were\r\nunfolding. The Italian Jews were carried along by the all-pervading\r\nspirit of the times, and had a share in the vigorous mental activity\r\nabout them. Suggestions derived from the work of the Renaissance leaders\r\nfell like electric sparks into Jewish literature and science, lighting\r\nthem up, and bringing them into rapport with the products of the\r\nhumanistic movement. Provence, the land of song, gave birth to Kalonymos\r\nben Kalonymos, later a resident of Italy, whose work, \"Touchstone\"\r\n(_Eben Bochan_) is the first true satire in neo-Hebraic poetry. It is a\r\nmirror of morals held up before his people, for high and low, rabbis and\r\nleaders, poets and scholars, rich and poor, to see their foibles and\r\nfollies. The satire expresses a humorous, but lofty conception of life,\r\nbased upon profound morality and sincere faith. It fulfils every\r\nrequirement of a satire, steering clear of the pitfall caricature, and\r\nnot obtruding the didactic element. The lesson to be conveyed is\r\ninvolved in, not stated apart from the satire, an emanation from the\r\npoet's disposition. His aim is not to ridicule, but to improve,\r\ninstruct, influence. One of the most amusing chapters is that on woman's\r\nsuperior advantages, which make him bewail his having been born a\r\nman:[53]\r\n\r\n    \"Truly, God's hand lies heavy on him\r\n    Who has been created a man:\r\n    Full many a trial he must patiently bear,\r\n    And scorn and contumely of every kind.\r\n    His life is like a field laid waste--\r\n    Fortunate he is if it lasts not too long!\r\n    Were I, for instance, a woman,\r\n    How smooth and pleasant were my course.\r\n    A circle of intimate friends\r\n    Would call me gentle, graceful, modest.\r\n    Comfortably I'd sit with them and sew,\r\n    With one or two mayhap at the spinning wheel.\r\n    On moonlight nights\r\n    Gathered for cozy confidences,\r\n    About the hearthfire, or in the dark,\r\n    We'd tell each other what the people say,\r\n    The gossip of the town, the scandals,\r\n    Discuss the fashions and the last election.\r\n    I surely would rise above the average--\r\n    I would be an artist needlewoman,\r\n    Broidering on silk and velvet\r\n    The flowers of the field,\r\n    And other patterns, copied from models,\r\n    So rich in color as to make them seem nature--\r\n    Petals, trees, blossoms, plants, and pots,\r\n    And castles, pillars, temples, angel heads,\r\n    And whatever else can be imitated with needle by her\r\n    Who guides it with art and skill.\r\n    Sometimes, too, though 'tis not so attractive,\r\n    I should consent to play the cook--\r\n    No less important task of woman 'tis\r\n    To watch the kitchen most carefully.\r\n    I should not be ruffled\r\n    By dust and ashes on the hearth, by soot on stoves and pots;\r\n    Nor would I hesitate to swing the axe\r\n    And chop the firewood,\r\n    And not to feed and rake the fire up,\r\n    Despite the ashy dust that fills the nostrils.\r\n    My particular delight it would be\r\n    To taste of all the dishes served.\r\n    And if some merry, joyous festival approached,\r\n    Then would I display my taste.\r\n    I would choose most brilliant gems for ear and hand,\r\n    For neck and breast, for hair and gown,\r\n    Most precious stuffs of silk and velvet,\r\n    Whatever in clothes and jewels would increase my charms.\r\n    And on the festal day, I would loud rejoice,\r\n    Sing, and sway myself, and dance with vim.\r\n    When I reached a maiden's prime,\r\n    With all my charms at their height,\r\n    What happiness, were heaven to favor me,\r\n    Permit me to draw a prize in life's lottery,\r\n    A youth of handsome mien, brave and true,\r\n    With heart filled with love for me.\r\n    If he declared his passion,\r\n    I would return his love with all my might.\r\n    Then as his wife, I would live a princess,\r\n    Reclining on the softest pillows,\r\n    My beauty heightened by velvet, silk, and tulle,\r\n    By pearls and golden ornaments,\r\n    Which he with lavish love would bring to me,\r\n    To add to his delight and mine.\"\r\n\r\nAfter enumerating additional advantages enjoyed by the gentler sex, the\r\npoet comes to the conclusion that protesting against fate is vain, and\r\ncloses his chapter thus:\r\n\r\n    \"Well, then, I'll resign myself to fate,\r\n    And seek consolation in the thought that life comes to an end.\r\n    Our sages tell us everywhere\r\n    That for all things we must praise God,\r\n    With loud rejoicing for all good,\r\n    In submission for evil fortune.\r\n    So I will force my lips,\r\n    However they may resist, to say the olden blessing:\r\n    My Lord and God accept my thanks\r\n    That thou has made of me a man.\"\r\n\r\nOne of Kalonymos's friends was Immanuel ben Solomon of Rome, called the\r\n\"Heine of the middle ages,\" and sometimes the \"Jewish Voltaire.\" Neither\r\ncomparison is apt. On the one hand, they give him too high a place as a\r\nwriter, on the other, they do not adequately indicate his characteristic\r\nqualities. His most important work, the _Mechabberoth_, is a collection\r\nof disjointed pieces, full of bold witticisms, poetic thoughts, and\r\nlinguistic charms. It is composed of poems, Makamat, parodies, novels,\r\nepigrams, distichs, and sonnets--all essentially humorous. The poet\r\npresents things as they are, leaving it to reality to create ridiculous\r\nsituations. He is witty rather than humorous. Rarely only a spark of\r\nkindliness or the glow of poetry transfigures his wit. He is uniformly\r\nobjective, scintillating, cold, often frivolous, and not always chaste.\r\nTo produce a comic effect, to make his readers laugh is his sole desire.\r\nFriend and admirer of Dante, he attained to a high degree of skill in\r\nthe sonnet. In neo-Hebraic poetry, his works mark the beginning of a new\r\nepoch. Indelicate witticisms and levity, until then sporadic in Jewish\r\nliterature, were by him introduced as a regular feature. The poetry of\r\nthe earlier writers had dwelt upon the power of love, their muse was\r\nmodest and chaste, a \"rose of Sharon,\" a \"lily of the valleys.\"\r\nImmanuel's was of coarser fibre; his witty sallies remind one of Italian\r\nrather than Hebrew models. A recent critic of Hebrew poetry speaks of\r\nhis Makamat as a pendant to \"Tristan and Isolde,\"--in both sensuality\r\ntriumphs over spirituality. He is at his best in his sonnets, and of\r\nthese the finest are in poetic prose. Female beauty is an unfailing\r\nsource of inspiration to him, but of trust in womankind he has none:\r\n\r\n    \"No woman ever faithful hold,\r\n    Unless she ugly be and old.\"\r\n\r\nThe full measure of mockery he poured out upon a deceived husband, and\r\nthe most cutting sarcasm at his command against an enemy is a\r\ncomparison to crabbed, ugly women:\r\n\r\n    \"I loathe him with the hot and honest hate\r\n    That fills a rake 'gainst maids he can not bait,\r\n    With which an ugly hag her glass reviles,\r\n    And prostitutes the youths who 'scape their wiles.\"\r\n\r\nHis devotion to woman's beauty is altogether in the spirit of his\r\nItalian contemporaries. One of his most pleasing sonnets is dedicated to\r\nhis lady-love's eyes:[54]\r\n\r\n    \"My sweet gazelle! From thy bewitching eyes\r\n      A glance thrills all my soul with wild delight.\r\n      Unfathomed depths beam forth a world so bright--\r\n    With rays of sun its sparkling splendor vies--\r\n    One look within a mortal deifies.\r\n      Thy lips, the gates wherethrough dawn wings its flight,\r\n      Adorn a face suffused with rosy light,\r\n    Whose radiance puts to shame the vaulted skies.\r\n    Two brilliant stars are they from heaven sent--\r\n      Their charm I cannot otherwise explain--\r\n    By God but for a little instant lent,\r\n      Who gracious doth their lustrous glory deign,\r\n    To teach those on pursuit of beauty bent,\r\n      Beside those eyes all other beauty's vain.\"\r\n\r\nImmanuel's most congenial work, however, is as a satirist. One of his\r\nbest known poems is a chain of distichs, drawing a comparison between\r\ntwo maidens, Tamar the beautiful, and Beria the homely:\r\n\r\n  \"Tamar raises her eyelids, and stars appear in the sky;\r\n  Her glance drops to earth, and flowers clothe the knoll whereon she stands.\r\n  Beria looks up, and basilisks die of terror;\r\n  Be not amazed; 'tis a sight that would Satan affright.\r\n  Tamar's divine form human language cannot describe;\r\n  The gods themselves believe her heaven's offspring.\r\n  Beria's presence is desirable only in the time of vintage,\r\n  When the Evil One can be banished by naught but grimaces.\r\n  Tamar! Had Moses seen thee he had never made the serpent of copper,\r\n  With thy image he had healed mankind.\r\n  Beria! Pain seizes me, physic soothes,\r\n  I catch sight of thee, and it returns with full force.\r\n  Tamar, with ringlets adorned, greets early the sun,\r\n  Who quickly hides, ashamed of his bald pate.\r\n  Beria! were I to meet thee on New Year's Day in the morning,\r\n  An omen 'twere of an inauspicious year.\r\n  Tamar smiles, and heals the heart's bleeding wounds;\r\n  She raises her head, the stars slink out of sight.\r\n  Beria it were well to transport to heaven,\r\n  Then surely heaven would take refuge on earth.\r\n  Tamar resembles the moon in all respects but one--\r\n  Her resplendent beauty never suffers obscuration.\r\n  Beria partakes of the nature of the gods; 'tis said,\r\n  None beholds the gods without most awful repentance.\r\n  Tamar, were the Virgin like thee, never would the sun\r\n  Pass out of Virgo to shine in Libra.\r\n  Beria, dost know why the Messiah tarries to bring deliverance to men?\r\n  Redemption time has long arrived, but he hides from thee.\"\r\n\r\nWith amazement we see the Hebrew muse, so serious aforetimes,\r\nparticipate in truly bacchanalian dances under Immanuel's guidance. It\r\nis curious that while, on the one hand, he shrinks from no frivolous\r\nutterance or indecent allusion, on the other, he is dominated by deep\r\nearnestness and genuine warmth of feeling, when he undertakes to defend\r\nor expound the fundamentals of faith. It is characteristic of the trend\r\nof his thought that he epitomizes the \"Song of Songs\" in the sentence:\r\n\"Love is the pivot of the _Torah_.\" By a bold hypothesis it is assumed\r\nthat in Daniel, his guide in Paradise (in the twenty-eighth canto of his\r\npoem), he impersonated and glorified his great friend Dante. If true,\r\nthis would be an interesting indication of the intimate relations\r\nexisting between a Jew and a circle devoted to the development of the\r\nnational genius in literature and language, and the stimulating of the\r\nsense of nature and truth in opposition to the fantastic visions and\r\ngrotesque ideals of the past.\r\n\r\nEverywhere, not only in Italy, the Renaissance and the humanistic\r\nmovement attract Jews. Among early Castilian troubadours there is a Jew,\r\nand the last troubadour of Spain again is a Jew. Naturally Italian Jews\r\nare more profoundly than others affected by the renascence of science\r\nand art. David ben Yehuda, Messer Leon, is the author of an epic,\r\n_Shebach Nashim_ (\"Praise of Women\"), in which occurs an interesting\r\nreference to Petrarch's Laura, whom, in opposition to the consensus of\r\nopinion among his contemporaries, he considers, not a figment of the\r\nimagination, but a woman of flesh and blood. Praise and criticism of\r\nwomen are favorite themes in the poetic polemics of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. For instance, Jacob ben Elias, of Fano, in his \"Shields of\r\nHeroes,\" a small collection of songs in stanzas of three verses,\r\nventures to attack the weaker sex, for which Judah Tommo of Porta Leone\r\nat once takes up the cudgels in his \"Women's Shield.\" At the same time a\r\ngenuine song combat broke out between Abraham of Sarteano and Elias of\r\nGenzano. The latter is the champion of the purity of womanhood, impugned\r\nby the former, who in fifty tercets exposes the wickedness of woman in\r\nthe most infamous of her sex, from Lilith to Jezebel, from Semiramis to\r\nMedea. An anonymous combatant lends force to his strictures by an\r\narraignment of the lax morals of the women of their own time, while a\r\nfourth knight of song, evidently intending to conciliate the parties,\r\nbegins his \"New Song,\" only a fragment of which has reached us, with\r\npraise, and ends it with blame, of woman. Such productions, too, are a\r\nresult of the Renaissance, of its romantic current, which, as it\r\naffected Catholicism, did not fail to leave its mark upon the Jews,\r\namong whom romanticists must have had many a battle to fight with\r\nadherents of traditional views.\r\n\r\nMeantime, neo-Hebraic poetry had \"fallen into the sear, the yellow\r\nleaf.\" Poetry drooped under the icy breath of rationalism, and vanished\r\ninto the abyss of the Kabbala. At most we occasionally hear of a polemic\r\npoem, a keen-edged epigram. For the rest, there was only a monotonous\r\nsuccession of religious poems, repeating the old formulas, dry bones of\r\nhabit and tradition, no longer informed with true poetic, religious\r\nspirit. Yet the source of love and humor in Jewish poetry had not run\r\ndry. It must be admitted that the sentimentalism of the minneservice,\r\npeculiar to the middle ages, never took root in Jewish soil. Pale\r\nresignation, morbid despair, longing for death, unmanly indulgence in\r\nregret, all the paraphernalia of chivalrous love, extolled in every key\r\nin the poetry of the middle ages, were foreign to the sane Jewish mind.\r\nWomen, the object of unreasoning adulation, shared the fate of all\r\nsovereign powers: homage worked their ruin. They became accustomed to\r\nthink that the weal and woe of the world depended upon their constancy\r\nor disloyalty. Jews alone were healthy enough to subordinate sexual love\r\nto reverence for maternity. Holding an exalted idea of love, they\r\nrealized that its power extends far beyond the lives of two persons, and\r\naffects the well-being of generations unborn. Such love, intellectual\r\nlove, which Benedict Spinoza was the first to define from a scientific\r\nand philosophic point of view, looks far down the vistas of the future,\r\nand gives providential thought to the race.\r\n\r\nWhile humor and romanticism everywhere in the middle ages appeared as\r\nirreconcilable contrasts, by Jews they were brought into harmonious\r\nrelationship. When humor was banished from poetry, it took refuge in\r\nJewish-German literature, that spiritual undercurrent produced by the\r\nclaims of fancy as opposed to the aggressive, all absorbing demands of\r\nreason. Not to the high and mighty, but to the lowly in spirit, the\r\nlittle ones of the earth, to women and children, it made its appeal, and\r\nfrom them its influence spread throughout the nation, bringing\r\nrefreshment and sustenance to weary, starved minds, hope to the\r\noppressed, and consolation to the afflicted. Consolation, indeed, was\r\nsorely needed by the Jews on their peregrinations during the middle\r\nages. Sad, inexpressibly sad, was their condition. With fatal\r\nexclusiveness they devoted themselves to the study of the Talmud.\r\nSecular learning was deprecated; antagonism to science and vagaries\r\ncharacterized their intellectual life; philosophy was formally\r\ninterdicted; the Hebrew language neglected; all their wealth and force\r\nof intellect lavished upon the study of the Law, and even here every\r\nfaculty--reason, ingenuity, speculation--busied itself only with highly\r\nartificial solutions of equally artificial problems, far-fetched\r\ncomplications, and vexatious contradictions invented to be harmonized.\r\nUnder such grievous circumstances, oppression growing with malice,\r\nJewish minds and hearts were robbed of humor, and the exercise of love\r\nwas made a difficult task. Is it astonishing that in such days a rabbi\r\nin the remote Slavonic East should have issued an injunction restraining\r\nhis sisters in faith from reading romances on the Sabbath--romances\r\ncomposed by some other rabbi in Provence or Italy five hundred years\r\nbefore?\r\n\r\nSorrow and suffering are not endless. A new day broke for the Jews. The\r\nwalls of the Ghetto fell, dry bones joined each other for new life, and\r\na fresh spirit passed over the House of Israel. Enervation and decadence\r\nwere succeeded by regeneration, quickened by the spirit of the times, by\r\nthe ideas of freedom and equality universally advocated. The forces\r\nwhich culminated in their revival had existed as germs in the preceding\r\ncentury. Silently they had grown, operating through every spiritual\r\nmedium, poetry, oratory, philosophy, political agitation. In the\r\nsunshine of the eighteenth century they finally matured, and at its\r\nclose the rejuvenation of the Jewish race was an accomplished fact in\r\nevery European country. Eagerly its sons entered into the new\r\nintellectual and literary movements of the nations permitted to enjoy\r\nanother period of efflorescence, and Jewish humor has conquered a place\r\nfor itself in modern literature.\r\n\r\nOur brief journey through the realm of love and humor must certainly\r\nconvince us that in sunny days humor rarely, love never, forsook Israel.\r\nOur old itinerant preachers (_Maggidim_), strolling from town to town,\r\nwere in the habit of closing their sermons with a parable (_Mashai_),\r\nwhich opened the way to exhortation. The manner of our fathers\r\nrecommends itself to me, and following in their footsteps, I venture to\r\nclose my pilgrimage through the ages with a _Mashal_. It transports us\r\nto the sunny Orient, to the little seaport town of Jabneh, about six\r\nmiles from Jerusalem, in the time immediately succeeding the destruction\r\nof the Temple. Thither with a remnant of his disciples, Jochanan ben\r\nZakkai, one of the wisest of our rabbis, fled to escape the misery\r\nincident to the downfall of Jerusalem. He knew that the Temple would\r\nnever again rise from its ashes. He knew as well that the essence of\r\nJudaism has no organic connection with the Temple or the Holy City. He\r\nforesaw that its mission is to spread abroad among the nations of the\r\nearth, and of this future he spoke to the disciples gathered about him\r\nin the academy at Jabneh. We can imagine him asking them to define the\r\nfundamental principle of Judaism, and receiving a multiplicity of\r\nanswers, varying with the character and temper of the young\r\nmissionaries. To one, possibly, Judaism seemed to rest upon faith in\r\nGod, to another upon the Sabbath, to a third upon the _Torah_, to a\r\nfourth upon the Decalogue. Such views could not have satisfied the\r\nspiritual cravings of the aged teacher. When Jochanan ben Zakkai rises\r\nto give utterance to his opinion, we feel as though the narrow walls of\r\nthe academy at Jabneh were miraculously widening out to enclose the\r\nworld, while the figure of the venerable rabbi grows to the noble\r\nproportions of a divine seer, whose piercing eye rends the veil of\r\nfuturity, and reads the remote verdict of history: \"My disciples, my\r\nfriends, the fundamental principle of Judaism is love!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JEWISH STAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps no people has held so peculiar a position with regard to the\r\ndrama as the Jews. Little more than two centuries have passed since a\r\nJewish poet ventured to write a drama, and now, if division by race be\r\nadmissible in literary matters, Jews indisputably rank among the first\r\nof those interested in the drama, both in its composition and\r\npresentation.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the Hebrew mind felt no attraction towards the drama. Hebrew\r\npoetry attained to neither dramatic nor epic creations, because the\r\nall-pervading monotheistic principle of the nation paralyzed the free\r\nand easy marshalling of gods and heroes of the Greek drama.\r\nNevertheless, traces of dramatic poetry appear in the oldest literature.\r\nThe \"Song of Songs\" by many is regarded as a dramatic idyl in seven\r\nscenes, with Shulammith as the heroine, and the king, the ostensible\r\nauthor, as the hero. But this and similar efforts are only faint\r\napproaches to dramatic composition, inducing no imitations.\r\n\r\nGreek and Roman theatrical representations, the first they knew, must\r\nhave awakened lively interest in the Jews. It was only after Alexander\r\nthe Great's triumphal march through the East, and the establishment of\r\nRoman supremacy over Judaea, that a foothold was gained in Palestine by\r\nthe institutions called theatre by the ancients; that is, _stadia_;\r\ncircuses for wrestling, fencing, and combats between men and animals;\r\nand the stage for tragedies and other plays. To the horror of pious\r\nzealots, the Jewish Hellenists, in other words, Jews imbued with the\r\nsecular culture of the day, built a gymnasium for the wrestling and\r\nfencing contests of the Jewish youth of Jerusalem, soon to be further\r\ndefiled by the circus and the _stadium_. According to Flavius Josephus,\r\nHerod erected a theatre at Jerusalem twenty-eight years before the\r\npresent era, and in the vicinity of the city, an amphitheatre where\r\nGreek players acted, and sang to the accompaniment of the lyre or flute.\r\n\r\nThe first, and at his time probably the only, Jewish dramatist was the\r\nGreek poet Ezekielos (Ezekiel), who flourished in about 150 before the\r\ncommon era. In his play, \"The Exodus from Egypt,\" modelled after\r\nEuripides, Moses, as we know him in the Bible, is the hero. Otherwise\r\nthe play is thoroughly Hellenic, showing the Greek tendency to become\r\ndidactic and reflective and use the heroes of sacred legend as human\r\ntypes. Besides, two fragments of Jewish-Hellenic dramas, in trimeter\r\nverse, have come down to us, the one treating of the unity of God, the\r\nother of the serpent in Paradise.\r\n\r\nTo the mass of the Jewish people, particularly to the expounders and\r\nscholars of the Law, theatrical performances seemed a desecration, a\r\nsin. A violent struggle ensued between the _Beth ha-Midrash_ and the\r\nstage, between the teachers of the Law and lovers of art, between\r\nRabbinism and Hellenism. Mindful of Bible laws inculcating humanity to\r\nbeasts and men, the rabbis could not fail to deprecate gladiatorial\r\ncontests, and in their simple-mindedness they must have revolted from\r\nthe themes of the Greek playwright, dishonesty, violence triumphant, and\r\nconjugal infidelity being then as now favorite subjects of dramatic\r\nrepresentations. The immorality of the stage was, if possible, more\r\nconspicuous in those days than in ours.\r\n\r\nThis was the point of view assumed by the rabbis in their exhortations\r\nto the people, and a conspiracy against King Herod was the result. The\r\nplotters one evening appeared at the theatre, but their designs were\r\nfrustrated by the absence of the king and his suite. The plot betrayed\r\nitself, and one of the members of the conspiracy was seized and torn\r\ninto pieces by the mob. The most uncompromising rabbis pronounced a\r\ncurse over frequenters of the theatre, and raised abstinence from its\r\npleasures to the dignity of a meritorious action, inasmuch as it was the\r\nscene of idolatrous practices, and its _habitues_ violated the\r\nadmonition contained in the first verse of the psalms. \"Cursed be they\r\nwho visit the theatre and the circus, and despise our laws,\" one of them\r\nexclaims.[55] Another interprets the words of the prophet: \"I sat not in\r\nthe assembly of the mirthful, and was rejoiced,\" by the prayer: \"Lord of\r\nthe universe, never have I visited a theatre or a circus to enjoy\r\nmyself in the company of scorners.\"\r\n\r\nDespite rampant antagonism, the stage worked its way into the affection\r\nand consideration of the Jewish public, and we hear of Jewish youths\r\ndevoting themselves to the drama and becoming actors. Only one has come\r\ndown to us by name: the celebrated Alityros in Rome, the favorite of\r\nEmperor Nero and his wife Poppaea. Josephus speaks of him as \"a player,\r\nand a Jew, well favored by Nero.\" When the Jewish historian landed at\r\nPuteoli, a captive, Alityros presented him to the empress, who secured\r\nhis liberation. Beyond a doubt, the Jewish _beaux esprits_ of Rome\r\nwarmly supported the theatre; indeed, Roman satirists levelled their\r\nshafts against the zeal displayed in the service of art by Jewish\r\npatrons.\r\n\r\nA reaction followed. Theatrical representations were pursued by Talmudic\r\nJudaism with the same bitter animosity as by Christianity. Not a matter\r\nof surprise, if account is taken of the licentiousness of the stage, so\r\ndepraved as to evoke sharp reproof even from a Cicero, and the hostility\r\nof playwrights to Jews and Christians, whom they held up as a butt for\r\nthe ridicule of the Roman populace. Talmudic literature has preserved\r\nseveral examples of the buffooneries launched against Judaism. Rabbi\r\nAbbayu tells the following:[56] A camel covered with a mourning blanket\r\nis brought upon the stage, and gives rise to a conversation. \"Why is\r\nthe camel trapped in mourning?\" \"Because the Jews, who are observing the\r\nsabbatical year, abstain from vegetables, and refuse to eat even herbs.\r\nThey eat only thistles, and the camel is mourning because he is deprived\r\nof his favorite food.\"\r\n\r\nAnother time a buffoon appears on the stage with head shaved close. \"Why\r\nis the clown mourning?\" \"Because oil is so dear.\" \"Why is oil dear?\" \"On\r\naccount of the Jews. On the Sabbath day they consume everything they\r\nearn during the week. Not a stick of wood is left to make fire whereby\r\nto cook their meals. They are forced to burn their beds for fuel, and\r\nsleep on the floor at night. To get rid of the dirt, they use an immense\r\nquantity of oil. Therefore, oil is dear, and the clown cannot grease his\r\nhair with pomade.\" Certainly no one will deny that the patrons of the\r\nRoman theatre were less critical than a modern audience.\r\n\r\nTeachers of the Law had but one answer to make to such attacks--a\r\nrigorous injunction against theatre-going. On this subject rabbis and\r\nChurch Fathers were of one mind. The rabbi's declaration, that he who\r\nenters a circus commits murder, is offspring of the same holy zeal that\r\ndictates Tertullian's solemn indignation: \"In no respect, neither by\r\nspeaking, nor by seeing, nor by hearing, have we part in the mad antics\r\nof the circus, the obscenity of the theatre, or the abominations of the\r\narena.\" Such expressions prepare one for the passion of another\r\nremonstrant who, on a Sabbath, explained to his audience that\r\nearthquakes are the signs of God's fierce wrath when He looks down upon\r\nearth, and sees theatres and circuses flourish, while His sanctuary lies\r\nin ruins.[57]\r\n\r\nAnathemas against the stage were vain. One teacher of the Law, in the\r\nmiddle of the second century, went so far as to permit attendance at the\r\ncircus and the _stadium_ for the very curious reason that the spectator\r\nmay haply render assistance to the charioteers in the event of an\r\naccident on the race track, or may testify to their death at court, and\r\nthus enable their widows to marry again. Another pious rabbi expresses\r\nthe hope that theatres and circuses at Rome at some future time may \"be\r\nconverted into academies of virtue and morality.\"\r\n\r\nSuch liberal views were naturally of extremely rare occurrence. Many\r\ncenturies passed before Jews in general were able to overcome antipathy\r\nto the stage and all connected with it. Pagan Rome with its artistic\r\ncreations was to sink, and the new Christian drama, springing from the\r\nruins of the old theatre, but making the religious its central idea, was\r\nto develop and invite imitation before the first germ of interest in\r\ndramatic subjects ventured to show itself in Jewish circles. The first\r\nJewish contribution to the drama dates from the ninth century. The story\r\nof Haman, arch-enemy of the Jews, was dramatized in celebration of\r\n_Purim_, the Jewish carnival. The central figure was Haman's effigy\r\nwhich was burnt, amid song, music, and general merrymaking, on a small\r\npyre, over which the participants jumped a number of times in gleeful\r\nrejoicing over the downfall of their worst enemy--extravagance\r\npardonable in a people which, on every other day of the year, tottered\r\nunder a load of distress and oppression.\r\n\r\nThis dramatic effort was only a sporadic phenomenon. Real, uninterrupted\r\nparticipation in dramatic art by Jews cannot be recorded until fully six\r\nhundred years later. Meantime the Spanish drama, the first to adapt\r\nBible subjects to the uses of the stage, had reached its highest\r\ndevelopment. By reason of its choice of subjects it proved so attractive\r\nto Jews that scarcely fifty years after the appearance of the first\r\nSpanish-Jewish playwright, a Spanish satirist deplores, in cutting\r\nverse, the Judaizing of dramatic poetry. In fact, the first original\r\ndrama in Spanish literature, the celebrated _Celestina_, is attributed\r\nto a Jew, the Marrano Rodrigo da Cota. \"Esther,\" the first distinctly\r\nJewish play in Spanish, was written in 1567 by Solomon Usque in Ferrara\r\nin collaboration with Lazaro Graziano. The subject treated centuries\r\nbefore in a roughshod manner naturally suggested itself to a genuine\r\ndramatist, who chose it in order to invest it with the dignity conferred\r\nby poetic art. This first essay in the domain of the Jewish drama was\r\nfollowed by a succession of dramatic creations by Jews, who, exiled from\r\nSpain, cherished the memory of their beloved country, and, carrying to\r\ntheir new homes in Italy and Holland, love for its language and\r\nliterature, wrote all their works, dramas included, in Spanish after\r\nSpanish models. So fruitful was their activity that shortly after the\r\nexile we hear of a \"Jewish Calderon,\" the author of more than twenty-two\r\nplays, some long held to be the work of Calderon himself, and therefore\r\nreceived with acclamation in Madrid. The real author, whose place in\r\nSpanish literature is assured, was Antonio Enriquez di Gomez, a Marrano,\r\nburnt in effigy at Seville after his escape from the clutches of the\r\nInquisition. His dramas in part deal with biblical subjects. Samson is\r\nobviously the mouthpiece of his own sentiments:\r\n\r\n    \"O God, my God, the time draws quickly nigh!\r\n      Now let a ray of thy great strength descend!\r\n    Make firm my hand to execute the deed\r\n      That alien rule upon our soil shall end!\"\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the seventeenth century, the Portuguese language\r\nusurped the place of Spanish among Jews, and straightway we hear of a\r\nJewish dramatist, Antonio Jose de Silva (1705-1739), one of the most\r\nillustrious of Portuguese poets, whose dramas still hold their own on\r\nthe repertory of the Portuguese stage. He was burnt at the stake, a\r\nmartyr to his faith, which he solemnly confessed in the hour of his\r\nexecution: \"I am a follower of a faith God-given according to your own\r\nteachings. God once loved this religion. I believe He still loves it,\r\nbut because you maintain that He no longer turns upon it the light of\r\nHis countenance, you condemn to death those convinced that God has not\r\nwithdrawn His grace from what He once favored.\" It is by no means an\r\nimprobable combination of circumstances that on the evening of the day\r\nwhereon Antonio Jose de Silva expired at the stake, an operetta written\r\nby the victim himself was played at the great theatre of Lisbon in\r\ncelebration of the auto-da-fe.\r\n\r\nJewish literature as such derived little increase from this poetic\r\nactivity among Jews. In the period under discussion a single Hebrew\r\ndrama was produced which can lay claim to somewhat more praise than is\r\nthe due of mediocrity. _Asireh ha-Tikwah_, \"The Prisoners of Hope,\"\r\nprinted in 1673, deserves notice because it was the first drama\r\npublished in Hebrew, and its author, Joseph Pensa de la Vega, was the\r\nlast of Spanish, as Antonio de Silva was the last of Portuguese, Jewish\r\npoets. The three act play is an allegory, treating of the victory of\r\nfree-will, represented by a king, over evil inclinations, personified by\r\nthe handsome lad Cupid. Though imbued with the solemnity of his\r\nresponsibilities as a ruler, the king is lured from the path of right by\r\nvarious persons and circumstances, chief among them Cupid, his\r\ncoquettish queen, and his sinful propensities. The opposing good forces\r\nare represented by the figures of harmony, Providence, and truth, and\r\nthey eventually lead the erring wanderer back to the road of salvation.\r\nThe _dramatis personae_ of this first Hebrew drama are abstractions,\r\ndevoid of dramatic life, mere allegorical personifications, but the\r\nunderlying idea is poetic, and the Hebrew style pure, euphonious, and\r\nrhythmical. Yet it is impossible to echo the enthusiasm which greeted\r\nthe work of the seventeen year old author in the Jewish academies of\r\nHolland. Twenty-one poets sang its praises in Latin, Hebrew, and Spanish\r\nverse. The following couplet may serve as a specimen of their eulogies:\r\n\r\n    \"At length Israel's muse assumes the tragic cothurn,\r\n    And happily wends her way through the metre's mazes.\"\r\n\r\nPensa, though the first to publish, was not the first Hebrew dramatist\r\nto write. The distinction of priority belongs to Moses Zacuto, who wrote\r\nhis Hebrew play, _Yesod Olam_[58] (\"The Foundation of the World\") a\r\nquarter of a century earlier. His subject is the persecution inflicted\r\nby idolaters upon Abraham on account of his faith, and the groundwork is\r\nthe Haggadistic narrative about Abraham's bold opposition to idolatrous\r\npractices, and his courage even unto death in the service of the true\r\nGod. According to Talmudic interpretation a righteous character of this\r\ndescription is one of the corner-stones of the universe. It must be\r\nadmitted that Zacuto's work is a drama with a purpose. The poet wished\r\nto fortify his exiled, harassed people with the inspiration and hope\r\nthat flow from the contemplation of a strong, bold personality. But the\r\nadmission does not detract from the genuine merits of the poem. On the\r\nother hand, this first dramatic effort naturally is crude, lacking in\r\nthe poetic forms supplied by highly developed art. Dialogues, prayers,\r\nand choruses follow each other without regularity, and in varying\r\nmetres, not destitute, however, of poetic sentiment and lyric beauties.\r\nOften the rhythm rises to a high degree of excellence, even elevation.\r\nLike Pensa, Zacuto was the disciple of great masters, and a comparison\r\nof either with Lope de Vega and Calderon will reveal the same southern\r\nwarmth, stilted pathos, exuberance of fancy, wealth of imagery,\r\nexcessive playing upon words, peculiar turns and phrases, erratic style,\r\nand other qualities characteristic of Spanish dramatic poetry in that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nAnother century elapsed before the muse of the Hebrew drama escaped from\r\nleading strings. Moses Chayyim Luzzatto (1707-1747) of Padua was a poet\r\nof true dramatic gifts, and had he lived at another time he might have\r\nattained to absolute greatness of performance. Unluckily, the\r\nsentimental, impressionable youth became hopelessly enmeshed in the\r\nsnares of mysticism. In his seventeenth year he composed a biblical\r\ndrama, \"Samson and the Philistines,\" the preserved fragments of which\r\nare faultless in metre. His next effort was an allegorical drama,\r\n_Migdal Oz_ (\"Tower of Victory\"), the style and moral of which show\r\nunmistakable signs of Italian inspiration, derived particularly from\r\nGuarini and his _Pastor Fido_, models not wholly commendable at a time\r\nwhen Maffei's _Merope_ was exerting wholesome influence upon the Italian\r\ndrama in the direction of simplicity and dignity. Nothing, however,\r\ncould wean Luzzatto from adherence to Spanish-Italian romanticism. His\r\nhappiest creation is the dramatic parable, _Layesharim Tehillah_\r\n(\"Praise unto the Righteous!\"). The poetry of the Bible here celebrates\r\nits resurrection. The rhythm and exuberance of the Psalms are reproduced\r\nin the tone and color of its language. \"All the fragrant flowers of\r\nbiblical poetry are massed in a single bed. Yet the language is more\r\nthan a mosaic of biblical phrases. It is an enamel of the most superb\r\nand the rarest of elegant expressions in the Bible. The peculiarities of\r\nthe historical writings are carefully avoided, while all modifications\r\nof style peculiar to poetry are gathered together to constitute what may\r\nfairly be called a vocabulary of poetic diction.\"[59]\r\n\r\nThe allegory _Layesharim Tehillah_ is full of charming traits, but lacks\r\nwarmth, naturalness, and human interest, the indispensable elements of\r\ndramatic action. The first act treats of the iniquity of men who prize\r\ndeceit beyond virtue, and closes with the retirement of the pious sage\r\nto solitude. The second act describes the hopes of the righteous man and\r\nhis fate, and the third sounds the praise of truth and justice. The\r\nthread of the story is slight, and the characters are pale phantoms,\r\ninstead of warm-blooded men. Yet the work must be pronounced a gem of\r\nneo-Hebraic poetry, an earnest of the great creations its author might\r\nhave produced, if in early youth he had not been caught in the swirling\r\nwaters, and dragged down into the abysmal depths of Kabbalistic\r\nmysticism. Despite his vagaries his poems were full of suggestiveness\r\nand stimulation to many of his race, who were inspired to work along the\r\nlines laid down by him. He may be considered to have inaugurated another\r\nepoch of classical Hebrew literature, interpenetrated with the modern\r\nspirit, which the Jewish dramas of his day are vigorously successful in\r\nclothing in a Hebrew garb.\r\n\r\nIn the popular literature in Jewish-German growing up almost unnoticed\r\nbeside classical Hebrew literature, we find popular plays, comedies,\r\nchiefly farces for the _Purim_ carnival. The first of them, \"The Sale of\r\nJoseph\" (_Mekirath Yoseph_, 1710), treats the biblical narrative in the\r\nform and spirit of the German farcical clown dialogues, Pickelhering\r\n(Merry-Andrew), borrowed from the latter, being Potiphar's servant and\r\ncounsellor. No dramatic or poetic value of any kind attaches to the\r\nplay. It is as trivial as any of its models, the German clown comedies,\r\nand possesses interest only as an index to the taste of the public,\r\nwhich surely received it with delight. Strangely enough the principal\r\nscene between Joseph and Selicha, Potiphar's wife, is highly discreet.\r\nIn a monologue, she gives passionate utterance to her love. Then Joseph\r\nappears, and she addresses him thus:\r\n\r\n    \"Be welcome, Joseph, dearest one,\r\n    My slave who all my heart has won!\r\n    I beg of thee grant my request!\r\n    So oft have I to thee confessed,\r\n    My love for thee is passing great.\r\n    In vain for answering love I wait.\r\n    Have not so tyrannous a mind,\r\n    Be not so churlish, so unkind--\r\n    I bear thee such affection, see,\r\n    Why wilt thou not give love to me?\"\r\n\r\nJoseph answers:\r\n\r\n    \"I owe my lady what she asks,\r\n    Yet this is not among my tasks.\r\n    I pray, my mistress, change thy mind;\r\n    Thou canst so many like me find.\r\n    How could I dare transgress my state,\r\n    And my great trust so violate?\r\n    My lord hath charged me with his house,\r\n    Excepting only his dear spouse;\r\n    Yet she, it seems, needs watching too.\r\n    Now, mistress, fare thee well, adieu!\"\r\n\r\nSelicha then says:\r\n\r\n    \"O heaven now what shall I do?\r\n    He'll list not to my vows so true.\r\n    Come, Pickelhering, tell me quick,\r\n    What I shall do his love to prick?\r\n    I'll die if I no means can find\r\n    To bend his humor to my mind.\r\n    I'll give thee gold, thou mayst depend,\r\n    If thou'lt but help me to my end.\"\r\n\r\nPickelhering appears, and says:\r\n\r\n    \"My lady, here I am, thy slave,\r\n    My wisest counsel thou shalt have.\r\n    Thou must lay violent hand on him,\r\n    And say: 'Unless thou'lt grant my whim,\r\n    I'll drive thee hence from out my court,\r\n    And with thy woes I'll have my sport,\r\n    Nor will I stay thy punishment,\r\n    Till drop by drop thy blood is spent.'\r\n    Perhaps he will amend his way,\r\n    If thou such cruel words wilt say.\"\r\n\r\nSelicha follows his advice, but being thwarted, again appeals to\r\nPickelhering, who says:\r\n\r\n    \"My lady fair, pray hark to me,\r\n    My counsel now shall fruitful be.\r\n    A garbled story shalt thou tell\r\n    The king, and say: 'Hear what befell:\r\n    Thy servant Joseph did presume\r\n    To enter in my private room,\r\n    When no one was about the house\r\n    Who could protect thy helpless spouse.\r\n    See here his mantle left behind.\r\n    Seize him, my lord, the miscreant find.'\"\r\n\r\nPotiphar appears, Selicha tells her tale, and Pickelhering is sent in\r\nquest of Joseph, who steps upon the scene to be greeted by his master's\r\nfar from gentle reproaches:\r\n\r\n    \"Thou gallowsbird, thou good-for-naught!\r\n    Thou whom so true and good I thought!\r\n    'Twere just to take thy life from thee.\r\n    But no! still harsher this decree:\r\n    In dungeon chained shalt thou repine,\r\n    Where neither sun nor moon can shine.\r\n    Forever there bewail thy lot unheard;\r\n    Now leave my sight, begone, thou gallowsbird.'\"\r\n\r\nThis ends the scene. Of course, at the last, Joseph escapes his doom,\r\nand, to the great joy of the sympathetic public, is raised to high\r\ndignities and honors.\r\n\r\nThis farce was presented at Frankfort-on-the-Main by Jewish students of\r\nthe city, aided by some from Hamburg and Prague, with extravagant\r\ndisplay of scenery. Tradition ascribes the authorship to a certain\r\nBeermann.\r\n\r\n\"Ahasverus\" is of similar coarse character, so coarse, indeed, that the\r\ndirectors of the Frankfort Jewish community, exercising their rights as\r\nliterary censors, forbade its performance, and had the printed copies\r\nburnt. A somewhat more refined comedy is _Acta Esther et Achashverosh_,\r\npublished at Prague in 1720, and enacted there by the pupils of the\r\ncelebrated rabbi David Oppenheim, \"on a regular stage with drums and\r\nother instruments.\" \"The Deeds of King David and Goliath,\" and a\r\ntravesty, \"Haman's Will and Death\" also belong to the category of Purim\r\nfarces.\r\n\r\nBy an abrupt transition we pass from their consideration to the Hebrew\r\nclassical drama modelled after the pattern of Moses Chayyim Luzzatto's.\r\nGreatest attention was bestowed upon historical dramas, notably those on\r\nthe trials and fortunes of Marranos, the favorite subjects treated by\r\nDavid Franco Mendez, Samuel Romanelli, and others. Although their\r\nlanguage is an almost pure classical Hebrew, the plot is conceived\r\nwholly in the spirit of modern times. At the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, a large number of writers turned to Bible heroes and heroines\r\nfor dramatic uses, and since then Jewish interest in the drama has never\r\nflagged. The luxuriant fruitfulness of these late Jewish playwrights,\r\nstanding in the sunlight of modern days, fully compensates for the\r\nsterility of the Jewish dramatic muse during the centuries of darkness.\r\n\r\nThe first Jewish dramatist to use German was Benedict David Arnstein, of\r\nVienna, author of a large number of plays, comedies and melodramas, some\r\nof which have been put upon the boards of the Vienna imperial theatre\r\n(_Burgtheater_). He was succeeded by L. M. Bueschenthal, whose drama,\r\n\"King Solomon's Seal,\" was performed at the royal theatre of Berlin.\r\nSince his time poets of Jewish race have enriched dramatic literature in\r\nall its departments. Their works belong to general literature, and need\r\nnot be individualized in this essay.\r\n\r\nIn the province of dramatic music, too, Jews have made a prominent\r\nposition for themselves. It suffices to mention Meyerbeer and Offenbach,\r\nrepresentatives of two widely divergent departments of the art. Again,\r\nto assert the prominence of Jews as actors is uttering a truism. Adolf\r\nJellinek, one of the closest students of the racial characteristics of\r\nJews, thinks that they are singularly well equipped for the theatrical\r\nprofession by reason of their marked subjectivity, which always induces\r\nobjective, disinterested devotion to a purpose, and their\r\ncosmopolitanism, which enables them to transport themselves with ease\r\ninto a new world of thought.[60] \"It is natural that a race whose\r\nreligious, literary, and linguistic development in hundreds of instances\r\nproves unique talent to adapt itself with marvellous facility to the\r\nintellectual life of various countries and nations, should bring forth\r\nindividuals gifted with power to project themselves into a character\r\ncreated by art, and impersonate it with admirable accuracy in the\r\nsmallest detail. What the race as a whole has for centuries been doing\r\nspontaneously and by virtue of innate characteristics, can surely be\r\ndone with greater perfection by some of its members under the\r\nconsciously accepted guidance of the laws of art.\" Many Jewish race\r\npeculiarities--quick perception, vivacity, declamatory pathos, perfervid\r\nimagination--are prime qualifications for the actor's career, and such\r\nnames as Bogumil Davison, Adolf Sonnenthal, Rachel Felix, and Sarah\r\nBernhardt abundantly illustrate the general proposition.\r\n\r\nStrenuous efforts to ascertain the name of the first Jewish actor in\r\nGermany have been unavailing. Possibly it was the unnamed artist for\r\nwhom, at his brother's instance, Lessing interceded at the Mannheim\r\nnational theatre.\r\n\r\nLegion is the name of the Jewish artists of this century who have\r\nattained to prominence in every department of the dramatic art, in every\r\ncountry, even the remotest, on the globe. Travellers in Russia tell of\r\nthe crowds that evening after evening flock to the Jewish-German\r\ntheatres at Odessa, Kiev, and Warsaw. The plays performed are\r\nadaptations of the best dramatic works of all modern nations. We\r\noutside of Russia have been made acquainted with the character of these\r\nperformances by the melodrama \"Shulammith,\" enacted at various theatres\r\nby a Jewish-German _opera bouffe_ company from Warsaw, and the writer\r\nonce--can he ever forget it?--saw \"Hamlet\" played by jargon actors. When\r\nHamlet offers advice to Ophelia in the words: \"Get thee to a nunnery!\"\r\nshe promptly retorts: _Mit Eizes bin ich versehen, mein Prinz!_ (With\r\ngood advice I am well supplied, my lord!).\r\n\r\nThe actor recalled by the recent centennial celebration of the first\r\nperformance of \"The Magic Flute\" must have been among the first Jews to\r\nadopt the stage as a profession. The first presentation, at once\r\nestablishing the success of the opera, took place at Prague. According\r\nto the _Prager Neue Zeitung_ an incident connected with that original\r\nperformance was of greater interest than the opera itself: \"On the tenth\r\nof last month, the new piece, 'The Magic Flute,' was produced. I\r\nhastened to the theatre, and found that the part of Sarastro was taken\r\nby a well-formed young man with a caressing voice who, as I was told to\r\nmy great surprise, was a Jew--yes, a Jew. He was visibly embarrassed\r\nwhen he first appeared, proving that he was a human being subject to the\r\nordinary laws of nature and to the average mortal's weaknesses. Noticing\r\nhis stage-fright, the audience tried to encourage him by applause. It\r\nsucceeded, for he sang and spoke his lines with grace and dignity. At\r\nthe end he was called out and applauded vigorously. In short, I found\r\nthe Prague public very different from its reputation with us. It knows\r\nhow to appreciate merit even when possessed by an Israelite, and I am\r\ninclined to think that it criticises harshly only when there is just\r\nreason for complaint. Hartung, the Jewish actor, will soon appear in\r\nother roles, and doubtless will justify the applause of the public.\"\r\n\r\nTo return, in conclusion, to the classical drama in Hebrew. Though\r\npatterned after the best classical models, and enriched by the noble\r\ncreations of S. L. Romanelli, M. E. Letteris, the translator of _Faust_,\r\nA. Gottloeber, and others, Hebrew dramas belong to the large class of\r\nplays for the closet, unsuited for the stage. This dramatic literature\r\ncontains not only original creations; the masterpieces of all\r\nliteratures--the works of Shakespere, Racine, Moliere, Goethe, Schiller,\r\nand Lessing--have been put into the language of the prophets and the\r\npsalmists, and, infected by the vigor of their thought, the ancient\r\ntongue has been re-animated with the vitality of undying youth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JEW'S QUEST IN AFRICA\r\n\r\n\r\nCitizens of ancient Greece conversing during the _entr'actes_ of a first\r\nperformance at the national theatre of Olympia were almost sure to ask\r\neach other, after the new play had been discussed: \"What news from\r\nAfrica?\" Through Aristotle the proverb has come down to us: \"Africa\r\nalways brings us something new.\" Hence the question: _Quid novi ex\r\nAfrica?_[61]\r\n\r\nIf ever two old rabbis in the _Beth ha-Midrash_ at Cyrene stole a chat\r\nin the intervals of their lectures, the same question probably passed\r\nbetween them. For, Africa has always claimed the interest of the\r\ncultured. Jewish-German legend books place the scenes of their most\r\nmysterious myths in the \"Dark Continent,\" and I remember distinctly how\r\nwe youngsters on Sabbath afternoons used to crowd round our dear old\r\ngrandmother, who, great bowed spectacles on her nose, would read to us\r\nfrom \"Yosippon.\" On many such occasions an unruly listener, with a view\r\nto hurrying the distribution of the \"Sabbathfruit,\" would endanger the\r\nstability of the dish by vigorous tugging at the table-cloth, and elicit\r\nthe reproof suggested by our reading: \"You are a veritable\r\nSambation!\"--Aristotle, Pliny, Olympia, Cyrene, \"Yosippon,\" and\r\ngrandam--all unite to whet our appetite for African novelties.\r\n\r\nNever has interest in the subject been more active than in our\r\ngeneration, and the question, \"What is the quest of the Jews in Africa?\"\r\nmight be applied literally to the achievements of individual Jewish\r\ntravellers. But our inquiry shall not be into the fortunes of African\r\nexplorers of Jewish extraction; not into Emin Pasha's journey to Wadelai\r\nand Magungo; not into the advisability of colonizing Russian Jews in\r\nAfrica; nor even into the role played by a part of northern Africa in\r\nthe development of Jewish literature and culture: briefly, \"The Jew's\r\nquest in Africa\" is for the remnants of the ten lost tribes.\r\n\r\nFor more than eight hundred years, Israel, entrenched on his own soil,\r\nbade defiance to every enemy. After the death of Solomon (978 B. C. E.),\r\nthe kingdom was divided, its power declining in consequence. The\r\nworld-monarchy Assyria became an adversary to be feared after Ahaz, king\r\nof Judah, invited it to assist him against Pekah. Tiglath-Pileser\r\nconquered a part of the kingdom of Israel, and, in about the middle of\r\nthe eighth century, carried off its subjects captive into Assyria. In\r\nthe reign of Hosea, Shalmaneser finished what his predecessor had begun\r\n(722), utterly destroying the kingdom of the north in the two hundred\r\nand fifty-eighth year of its independence. Before the catastrophe, a\r\npart of its inhabitants had emigrated to Arabia, so that there were\r\nproperly speaking only nine tribes, called by their prophets, chief\r\namong them Hosea and Amos, Ephraim from the most powerful member of the\r\nconfederacy. Another part went to Adiabene, a district on the boundary\r\nbetween Assyria and Media, and thence scattered in all directions\r\nthrough the kingdom of the Medes and Persians.\r\n\r\nThe prophets of the exile still hope for their return. Isaiah says:[62]\r\n\"The Lord will put forth His hand again the second time to acquire the\r\nremnant of his people, which shall remain, from Asshur, and from Egypt,\r\nand from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and\r\nfrom Chamath, and from the islands of the sea. And he will lift up an\r\nensign unto the nations, and will assemble the outcasts of Israel; and\r\nthe dispersed of Judah will he collect together from the four corners of\r\nthe earth.... Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not assail\r\nEphraim.... And the Lord will utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian\r\nsea.... And there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people,\r\nwhich shall remain from Asshur, like as it was to Israel on the day that\r\nthey came up out of the land of Egypt.\" In Jeremiah[63] we read: \"Behold\r\nI will bring them from the north country, and I will gather them from\r\nthe farthest ends of the earth ... for I am become a father to Israel,\r\nand Ephraim is my first-born.\" Referring to this passage, the Talmud\r\nmaintains that the prophet Jeremiah led the lost tribes back to\r\nPalestine.\r\n\r\nThe second Isaiah[64] says \"to the prisoners, Go forth; to those that\r\nare in darkness, Show yourselves.\" \"Ye shall be gathered up one by\r\none.... And it shall come to pass on that day that the great cornet\r\nshall be blown, and then shall come those that are lost in the land of\r\nAsshur, and those who are outcasts in the land of Egypt, and they shall\r\nprostrate themselves before the Lord on the holy mount at Jerusalem.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Ezekiel:[65] \"Thou son of man, take unto thyself one stick of wood,\r\nand write upon it, 'For Judah, and for the children of Israel his\r\ncompanions'; then take another stick, and write upon it, 'For Joseph,\r\nthe stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions':\r\nand join them one to the other unto thee as one stick; and they shall\r\nbecome one in thy hand.\"\r\n\r\nThese prophetical passages show that at the time of the establishment of\r\nthe second commonwealth the new homes of the ten tribes were accurately\r\nknown. After that, for more than five hundred years, history is silent\r\non the subject. From frequent allusions in the prophetical writings, we\r\nmay gather that efforts were made to re-unite Judah and the tribes of\r\nIsrael, and it seems highly probable that they were successful, such of\r\nthe ten tribes as had not adopted the idolatrous practices of the\r\nheathen returning with the exiles of Judah. In the Samaritan book of\r\nJoshua, it is put down that many out of the tribes of Israel migrated to\r\nthe north of Palestine at the time when Zerubbabel and Ezra brought the\r\ntrain of Babylonian exiles to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nIn Talmudic literature we occasionally run across a slight reference to\r\nthe ten tribes, as, for instance, Mar Sutra's statement that they\r\njourneyed to Iberia, at that time synonymous with Spain, though the\r\nrabbi probably had northern Africa in mind. Another passage relates that\r\nthe Babylonian scholars decided that no one could tell whether he was\r\ndescended from Reuben or from Simon, the presumption in their mind\r\nevidently being that the ten tribes had become amalgamated with Judah\r\nand Benjamin. If they are right, if from the time of Jeremiah to the\r\nSyrian domination, a slow process of assimilation was incorporating the\r\nscattered of the ten tribes into the returned remnant of Judah and\r\nBenjamin, then the ten lost tribes have no existence, and we are dealing\r\nwith a myth. But the question is still mooted. The prophets and the\r\nrabbis continually dwell upon the hope of reunion. The Pesikta is the\r\nfirst authority to locate the exile home of the ten tribes on the\r\nSambation. A peculiarly interesting conversation on the future of the\r\nten tribes between two learned doctors of the Law, Rabbi Akiba and Rabbi\r\nEliezer, has been preserved. Rabbi Eliezer maintains: \"The Eternal has\r\nremoved the ten tribes from their soil, and cast them forth into another\r\nland, as irrevocably as this day goes never to return.\" Rabbi Akiba, the\r\nenthusiastic nationalist, thinks very differently: \"No, day sinks, and\r\npasses into night only to rise again in renewed brilliance. So the ten\r\ntribes, lost in darkness, will reappear in refulgent light.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not unlikely that Akiba's journeys, extending into Africa, and\r\nundertaken to bring about the restoration of the independence of Judaea,\r\nhad as their subsidiary, unavowed purpose, the discovery of the ten lost\r\ntribes. The \"Dark Continent\" played no unimportant role in Talmudic\r\nwritings, special interest attaching to their narratives of the African\r\nadventures of Alexander the Great.[66] On one occasion, it is said, the\r\nwise men of Africa appeared in a body before the king, and offered him\r\ngifts of gold. He refused them, being desirous only of becoming\r\nacquainted with the customs, statutes, and law, of the land. They,\r\ntherefore, gave him an account of a lawsuit which was exciting much\r\nattention at the time: A man had bought a field from his friend and\r\nneighbor, and while digging it up, had found a treasure which he refused\r\nto keep, as he considered it the property of the original owner of the\r\nfield. The latter maintained that he had sold the land and all on and\r\nwithin it, and, therefore, had no claim upon the treasure. The doctors\r\nof the law put an end to the dispute by the decision that the son of the\r\none contestant was to take to wife the daughter of the other, the\r\ntreasure to be their marriage portion. Alexander marvelled greatly at\r\nthis decision. \"With us,\" he said, \"the government would have had the\r\nlitigants killed, and would have confiscated the treasure.\" Hereupon\r\none of the wise men exclaimed: \"Does the sun shine in your land? Have\r\nyou dumb beasts where you live? If so, surely it is for them that God\r\nsends down the rain, and lets the sun shine!\"\r\n\r\nIn biblical literature, too, frequent mention is made of Africa. The\r\nfirst explorer of the \"Dark Continent\" was the patriarch Abraham, who\r\njourneyed from Ur of the Chaldees through Mesopotamia, across the\r\ndeserts and mountains of Asia, to Zoan, the metropolis of ancient Egypt.\r\nWhen Moses fled from before Pharaoh, he found refuge, according to a\r\nTalmudic legend, in the Soudan, where he became ruler of the land for\r\nforty years, and later on, Egypt was the asylum for the greater number\r\nof Jewish rebels and fugitives. As early as the reign of King Solomon,\r\nships freighted with silver sailed to Africa, and Jewish sailors in part\r\nmanned the Phoenician vessels despatched to the coasts of the Red Sea\r\nto be loaded with the gold dust of Africa, whose usual name in Hebrew\r\nwas _Ophir_, meaning gold dust. In the Talmud Africa is generally spoken\r\nof as \"the South,\" owing to its lying south of Palestine. One of its\r\nproverbs runs thus: \"He who would be wise, must go to the South.\" The\r\nstory of Alexander the Great and the African lawyers is probably a\r\nsample of the wisdom lauded. Nor were the doctors of the Talmud ignorant\r\nof the physical features of the country. A scoffer asked, \"Why have\r\nAfricans such broad feet.\" \"Because they live on marshy soil, and must\r\ngo barefoot,\" was the ready answer given by Hillel the Great.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a discussion about the appearance of the cherubim,\r\nAkiba pointed out that in Africa a little child is called \"cherub.\"\r\nThence he inferred that the faces of cherubim resembled those of little\r\nchildren. On his travels in Africa, the same rabbi was appealed to by a\r\nmighty negro king: \"See, I am black, and my wife is black. How is it\r\nthat my children are white?\" Akiba asked him whether there were pictures\r\nin his palace. \"Yes,\" answered the monarch, \"my sleeping chamber is\r\nadorned with pictures of white men.\" \"That solves the puzzle,\" said\r\nAkiba. Evidently civilization had taken root in Africa more than\r\neighteen hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nTo return to the lost tribes: No land on the globe has been considered\r\ntoo small, none too distant, for their asylum. The first country to\r\nsuggest itself was the one closest to Palestine, Arabia, the bridge\r\nbetween Asia and Africa. In the first centuries of this era, two great\r\nkingdoms, Yathrib and Chaibar, flourished there, and it is altogether\r\nprobable that Jews were constantly emigrating thither. As early as the\r\ntime of Alexander the Great, thousands were transported to Arabia,\r\nparticularly to Yemen, where entire tribes accepted the Jewish faith.\r\nRecent research has made us familiar with the kingdom of Tabba (500) and\r\nthe Himyarites. Their inscriptions and the royal monuments of the old\r\nAfrican-Jewish population prove that Jewish immigrants must have been\r\nnumerous here, as in southern Arabia. When Mohammed unfurled the banner\r\nof the Prophet, and began his march through the desert, his followers\r\ncounted not a few Jews. In similar numbers they spread to northern\r\nAfrica, where, towards the end of the first thousand years of the\r\nChristian era, they boasted large communities, and played a prominent\r\nrole in Jewish literature, as is attested by the important contributions\r\nto Jewish law, grammar, poetry, and medicine, by such men as Isaac\r\nIsraeli, Chananel, Jacob ben Nissim, Dunash ben Labrat, Yehuda Chayyug,\r\nand later, Isaac Alfassi. When this north-African Jewish literature was\r\nat its zenith, interest in the whereabouts of the ten tribes revived,\r\nfirst mention of them being made in the last quarter of the ninth\r\ncentury. One day there appeared in the academy at Kairwan an adventurer\r\ncalling himself Eldad, and representing himself to be a member of the\r\ntribe of Dan. Marvellous tales he told the wondering rabbis of his own\r\nadventures, which read like a Jewish Odyssey, and of the independent\r\ngovernment established by Jews in Africa, of which he claimed to be a\r\nsubject. Upon its borders, he reported, live the Levitical singers, the\r\ndescendants of Moses, who, in the days of Babylonish captivity, hung\r\ntheir harps upon the willows, refusing to sing the songs of Zion upon\r\nthe soil of the stranger, and willing to sacrifice limb and life rather\r\nthan yield to the importunities of their oppressors. A cloud had\r\nenveloped and raised them aloft, bearing them to the land of Chavila\r\n(Ethiopia). To protect them from their enemies, their refuge in a trice\r\nwas girdled by the famous Sambation, a stream, not of waters, but of\r\nrapidly whirling stones and sand, tumultuously flowing during six days,\r\nand resting on the Sabbath, when the country was secured against foreign\r\ninvasion by a dense cloud of dust. With their neighbors, the sons of\r\nMoses have intercourse only from the banks of the stream, which it is\r\nimpossible to pass.[67]\r\n\r\nThis clever fellow, who had travelled far and wide, and knew men and\r\ncustoms, gave an account also of a shipwreck which he had survived, and\r\nof his miraculous escape from cannibals, who devoured his companions,\r\nbut, finding him too lean for their taste, threw him into a dungeon.\r\nHomer's Odyssey involuntarily suggests itself to the reader. In Spain we\r\nlose trace of the singular adventurer, who must have produced no little\r\nexcitement in the Jewish world of his day.\r\n\r\nSearch for the ten tribes had now re-established itself as a subject of\r\nperennial interest. In the hope of the fulfilment of the biblical\r\npromise: \"The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from\r\nbetween his feet, until he comes to Shiloh,\" even the most famous Jewish\r\ntraveller of the middle ages, Benjamin of Tudela, did not disdain to\r\nfollow up the \"traces of salvation.\" Nor has interest waned in our\r\ngeneration. Whenever we hear of a Jewish community whose settlement in\r\nits home is tinged with mystery, we straightway seek to establish its\r\nconnection with the ten lost tribes. They have been placed in Armenia,\r\nSyria, and Mesopotamia, where the Nestorian Christians, calling\r\nthemselves sons of Israel, live to the number of two hundred thousand,\r\nobserving the dietary laws and the Sabbath, and offering up sacrifices.\r\nThey have been sought in Afghanistan, India, and Western Asia, the land\r\nof the \"Beni Israel,\" with Jewish features, Jewish names, such as\r\nSolomon, David, and Benjamin, and Jewish laws, such as that of the\r\nLevirate marriage. One chain of hills in their country bears the name\r\n\"Solomon's Mountains,\" another \"Amram Chain,\" and the most warlike tribe\r\nis called Ephraim, while the chief tenet of their law is \"eye for eye,\r\ntooth for tooth.\" Search for the lost has been carried still further, to\r\nthe coast of China, to the settlements of Cochin and Malabar, where\r\nwhite and black Jews write their law upon scrolls of red goatskin.\r\n\r\nWestward the quest has reached America: Manasseh ben Israel and Mordecai\r\nNoah, the latter of whom hoped to establish a Jewish commonwealth at\r\nArarat near Buffalo, in the beginning of this century, believed that\r\nthey had discovered traces of the lost tribes among the Indians. The\r\nSpaniards in Mexico identified them with the red men of Anahuac and\r\nYucatan, a theory suggested probably by the resemblance between the\r\nJewish and the Indian aquiline nose. These would-be ethnologists\r\nobviously did not take into account the Mongolian descent of the Indian\r\ntribes and their pre-historic migration from Asia to America across\r\nBehring Strait.\r\n\r\nEurope has not escaped the imputation of being the refuge of the lost\r\ntribes. When Alfonso XI. expelled the Saracens from Toledo, the Jews of\r\nthe city asked permission to remain on the plea that they were not\r\ndescendants of the murderers of Jesus, but of those ten tribes whom\r\nNebuchadnezzar had sent to Tarshish as colonists. The petition was\r\ngranted, and their explanation filed among the royal archives at Toledo.\r\n\r\nThe English have taken absorbing interest in the fate of the lost\r\ntribes, maintaining by most elaborate arguments their identity with the\r\ninhabitants of Scandinavia and England. The English people have always\r\nhad a strong biblical bias. To this day they live in the Bible, and are\r\nflattered by the hypothesis that the Anglo-Saxons and kindred tribes,\r\nwho crossed over to Britain under Hengist and Horsa in the fifth\r\ncentury, were direct descendants of Abraham, their very name\r\n_Sakkasuna_, that is, sons of Isaac, vouching for the truth of the\r\ntheory. The radical falseness of the etymology is patent. The gist of\r\ntheir argument is that the tribe of Dan settled near the source of the\r\nJordan, becoming the maritime member of the Israelitish confederacy, and\r\ncalling forth from Deborah the rebuke that the sons of Dan tarried in\r\nships when the land stood in need of defenders. And now comes the most\r\nextravagant of the vagaries of the etymological reasoner: he suggests a\r\nconnection between Dan, Danube, Danai, and Danes, and so establishes the\r\nEnglish nation's descent from the tribes of Israel.\r\n\r\nIn the third decade of this century, when Shalmaneser's obelisk was\r\nfound with the inscription \"Tribute of Jehu, son of Omri,\" English\r\ninvestigators, seeking to connect it with the Cimbric Chersonese in\r\nJutland, at once took it for \"Yehu ibn Umry.\" An Irish legend has it\r\nthat Princess Tephi came to Ireland from the East, and married King\r\nHeremon, or Fergus, of Scotland. In her suite was the prophet Ollam\r\nFolla, and his scribe Bereg. The princess was the daughter of Zedekiah,\r\nthe prophet none other than Jeremiah, and the scribe, as a matter of\r\ncourse, Baruch. The usefulness of this fine-spun analogy becomes\r\napparent when we recall that Queen Victoria boasts descent from Fergus\r\nof Scotland, and so is furnished with a line of descent which would\r\njustify pride if it rested on fact instead of fancy. On the other hand,\r\nimagine the dismay of Heinrich von Treitschke, Saxon _par excellence_,\r\nwere it proved that he is a son of the ten lost tribes!\r\n\r\n\"Salvation is of the Jews!\" is the motto of a considerable movement\r\nconnected with the lost tribes in England and America. More than thirty\r\nweekly and monthly journals are discharging a volley of eloquence in the\r\npropaganda of the new doctrine, and lecturers and societies keep\r\ninterest in it alive. An apostolic believer in the Israelitish descent\r\nof the British has recently turned up in the person of a bishop, and the\r\nidentity of the ancient and the modern people has been raised to the\r\ndignity of a dogma of the Christian Church by a sect which, according to\r\na recent utterance of an Indianapolis preacher, holds the close advent\r\nof Judgment Day. Yet the ten lost tribes may be a myth!\r\n\r\nOne thing seems certain: If scattered remnants do exist here and there,\r\nthey must be sought in Africa, in that part, moreover, most accessible\r\nto travellers, that is to say, Abyssinia, situated in the central\r\nportion of the great, high tableland of eastern Africa between the basin\r\nof the Nile and the shores of the Red and the Arabian Sea--a tremendous,\r\nrocky, fortress-like plateau, intersected closely with a network of\r\nriver-beds, the Switzerland of Africa, as many please to call it.\r\nAlexander the Great colonized many thousands of Jews in Egypt on the\r\nsouthern and northern coasts of the Mediterranean, and in south-eastern\r\nAfrica. Thence they penetrated into the interior of Abyssinia, where\r\nthey founded a mighty kingdom extending to the river Sobat. Abyssinian\r\nlegends have another version of the history of this realm. It is said\r\nthat the Queen of Sheba bore King Solomon a son, named Menelek, whom he\r\nsent to Abyssinia with a numerous retinue to found an independent\r\nkingdom. In point of fact, Judaism seems to have been the dominant\r\nreligion in Abyssinia until 340 of the Christian era, and the _Golah_ of\r\nCush (the exiles in Abyssinia) is frequently referred to in mediaeval\r\nHebrew literature.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish kingdom flourished until a great revolution broke out in the\r\nninth century under Queen Judith (Sague), who conquered Axum, and\r\nreigned over Abyssinia for forty years. The Jewish ascendancy lasted\r\nthree hundred and fifty years. Rueppell,[68] a noted African explorer,\r\ngives the names of Jewish dynasties from the ninth to the thirteenth\r\ncentury. In the wars of the latter and the following century, the Jews\r\nlost their kingdom, keeping only the province of Semen, guarded by\r\ninaccessible mountains. Benjamin of Tudela describes it as \"a land full\r\nof mountains, upon whose rocky summits they have perched their towns and\r\ncastles, holding independent sway to the mortal terror of their\r\nneighbors.\" Combats, persecutions, and banishments lasted until the end\r\nof the eighteenth century. Anarchy reigned, overwhelming Gideon and\r\nJudith, the last of the Jewish dynasty, and proving equally fatal to the\r\nChristian empire, whose Negus Theodore likewise traced his descent from\r\nSolomon. So, after a thousand years of mutual hostility, the two ancient\r\nnative dynasties, claiming descent from David and Solomon, perished\r\ntogether, but the memory of the Jewish princes has not died out in the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe Abyssinian Jews are called Falashas, the exiled.[69] They live\r\nsecluded in the province west of Takazzeh, and their number is estimated\r\nby some travellers to be two hundred and fifty thousand, while my friend\r\nDr. Edward Glaser judges them to be only twenty-five thousand strong.\r\nInto the dreary wastes inhabited by these people, German and English\r\nmissionaries have found their way to spread among them the blessings of\r\nChristianity. The purity of these blessings may be inferred from the\r\nnames of the missionaries: Flad, Schiller, Brandeis, Stern, and\r\nRosenbaum.\r\n\r\nInformation about the misery of the Falashas penetrated to Europe, and\r\ninduced the _Alliance Israelite Universelle_ to despatch a Jewish\r\nmessenger to Abyssinia. Choice fell upon Joseph Halevy, professor of\r\nOriental languages at Paris, one of the most thorough of Jewish\r\nscholars, than whom none could be better qualified for the mission. It\r\nwas a memorable moment when Halevy, returned from his great journey to\r\nAbyssinia, addressed the meeting of the _Alliance_ on July 30, 1868, as\r\nfollows:[70] \"The ancient land of Ethiopia has at last disclosed the\r\nsecret concerning the people of whom we hitherto knew naught but the\r\nname. In the midst of the most varied fortunes they clung to the Law\r\nproclaimed on Sinai, and constant misery has not drained them of the\r\nvitality which enables nations to fulfil the best requirements of modern\r\nsociety.\"\r\n\r\nAdverse circumstances robbed Halevy of a great part of the material\r\ngathered on his trip. What he rescued and published is enough to give us\r\na more detailed and accurate account of the Falashas than we have\r\nhitherto possessed. He reports that they address their prayers to one\r\nGod, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; that they feel pride in\r\nbelonging to the old, yet ever young tribe which has exercised dominant\r\ninfluence upon the fate of men; that love for the Holy Land fills their\r\nhearts; and that the memory of Israel's glorious past is their\r\nspiritual stay. One of the articles of their faith is the restoration of\r\nJewish nationality.\r\n\r\nThe Falashas speak two languages, that of the land, the Amharic, a\r\nbranch of the ancient Geez, and the Agau, a not yet classified dialect.\r\nTheir names are chiefly biblical. While in dress they are like their\r\nneighbors, the widest difference prevails between their manners and\r\ncustoms and those of the other inhabitants of the land. In the midst of\r\na slothful, debauched people, they are distinguished for simplicity,\r\ndiligence, and ambition. Their houses for the most part are situated\r\nnear running water; hence, their cleanly habits. At the head of each\r\nvillage is a synagogue called _Mesgid_, whose Holy of holies may be\r\nentered only by the priest on the Day of Atonement, while the people\r\npray in the court without. Next to the synagogue live the monks\r\n(_Nesirim_). The priests offer up sacrifices, as in ancient times, daily\r\nexcept on the Day of Atonement, the most important being that for the\r\nrepose of the dead. On the space surrounding the synagogue stand the\r\nhouses of the priests, who, in addition to their religious functions,\r\nfill the office of teachers of the young. The Falashas are well\r\nacquainted with the Bible, but wholly ignorant of the Hebrew language.\r\nTheir ritual has been published by Joseph Halevy, who has added a Hebrew\r\ntranslation, showing its almost perfect identity with the traditional\r\nform of Jewish prayer. About their devotional exercises Halevy says:\r\n\"From the holy precincts the prayers of the faithful rise aloft to\r\nheaven. From midnight on, we hear the clear, rhythmical, melancholy\r\nintonation of the precentor, the congregation responding in a monotonous\r\nrecitative. Praise of the Eternal, salvation of Israel, love of Zion,\r\nhope of a happy future for all mankind--these form the burden of their\r\nprayers, calling forth sighs and tears, exclamations of hope and joy.\r\nBreak of day still finds the worshippers assembled, and every evening\r\nwithout fail, as the sun sinks to rest, their loud prayer (beginning\r\nwith _Abba! Abba!_ Lord! Lord!) twice wakes the echoes.\"[71]\r\n\r\nTheir well kept houses are presided over by their women, diligent and\r\nmodest. Polygamy is unknown. There are agriculturists and artisans,\r\nrepresentatives of every handicraft: smiths, tailors, potters, weavers,\r\nand builders. Commerce is not esteemed, trading with slaves being held\r\nin special abhorrence. Their laws permit the keeping of a slave for only\r\nsix years. If at the expiration of that period he embraces their\r\nreligion, he is free. They are brave warriors, thousands of them having\r\nfought in the army of Negus Theodore.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that intellectually they are undeveloped. They have\r\na sort of Midrash, which apparently has been handed down from generation\r\nto generation by word of mouth. The misfortunes they have endured have\r\npredisposed them to mysticism, and magicians and soothsayers are\r\nnumerous and active among them. But they are eager for information.\r\n\r\nKing Theodore protected them, until missionaries poisoned his mind\r\nagainst the Falashas. In 1868 he summoned a deputation of their elders,\r\nand commanded them to accept Christianity. Upon their refusal the king\r\nordered his soldiers to fire on the rebels. Hundreds of heads were\r\nraised, and the men, baring their breasts, cried out: \"Strike, O our\r\nKing, but ask us not to perjure ourselves.\" Moved to admiration by their\r\nintrepidity, the king loaded the deputies with presents, and dismissed\r\nthem in peace.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries--Europe does not yet know how often the path of these\r\npious men is marked by tears and blood--must be held guilty of many of\r\nthe bitter trials of the Falashas. In the sixties they succeeded in\r\nexciting Messianic expectations. Suddenly, from district to district,\r\nleapt the news that the Messiah was approaching to lead Israel back to\r\nPalestine. A touching letter addressed by the elders of the Falashas to\r\nthe representatives of the Jewish community at Jerusalem, whom it never\r\nreached, was found by a traveller, and deserves to be quoted:\r\n\r\n\"Has the time not yet come when we must return to the Holy Land and Holy\r\nCity? For, we are poor and miserable. We have neither judges nor\r\nprophets. If the time has arrived, we pray you send us the glad tidings.\r\nGreat fear has fallen upon us that we may miss the opportunity to\r\nreturn. Many say that the time is here for us to be reunited with you in\r\nthe Holy City, to bring sacrifices in the Temple of our Holy Land. For\r\nthe sake of the love we bear you, send us a message. Peace with you and\r\nall dwelling in the land given by the Lord to Moses on Sinai!\"\r\n\r\nFilled with the hope of redemption, large numbers of the Falashas, at\r\ntheir head venerable old men holding aloft banners and singing pious\r\nsongs, at that time left their homes. Ignorant of the road to be taken,\r\nthey set their faces eastward, hoping to reach the shores of the Red\r\nSea. The distance was greater than they could travel. At Axum they came\r\nto a stop disabled, and after three years the last man had succumbed to\r\nmisery and privation.\r\n\r\nThe distress of the Falashas is extreme, but they count it sweet\r\nalleviation if their sight is not troubled by missionaries. At a time\r\nwhen the attention of the civilized world is directed to Africa,\r\nEuropean Jews should not be found wanting in care for their unfortunate\r\nbrethren in faith in the \"Dark Continent.\" Abundant reasons recommend\r\nthem to our loving-kindness. They are Jews--they would suffer a thousand\r\ndeaths rather than renounce the covenant sealed on Sinai. They are\r\nunfortunate; since the civil war, they have suffered severely under all\r\nmanner of persecution. Mysticism and ignorance prevail among them--the\r\nwhole community possesses a single copy of the Pentateuch. Finally, they\r\nshow eager desire for spiritual regeneration. When Halevy took leave of\r\nthem, a handsome youth threw himself at his feet, and said: \"My lord,\r\ntake me with you to the land of the Franks. Gladly will I undergo the\r\nhardships of the journey. I want neither silver nor gold--all I crave\r\nis knowledge!\" Halevy brought the young Falasha to Paris, and he proved\r\nan indefatigable student, who acquired a wealth of knowledge before his\r\nearly death.\r\n\r\nDespite the incubus of African barbarism, this little Jewish tribe on\r\nthe banks of the legend-famed Sabbath stream has survived with Jewish\r\nvitality unbroken and purity uncontaminated. With longing the Falashas\r\nare awaiting a future when they will be permitted to join the councils\r\nof their Israelitish brethren in all quarters of the globe, and confess,\r\nin unison with them and all redeemed, enlightened men, that \"the Lord is\r\none, and His name one.\"\r\n\r\nThe steadfastness of their faith imposes upon us the obligation to bring\r\nthem redemption. We must unbar for them not only Jerusalem, but the\r\nwhole world, that they may recognize, as we do, the eternal truth\r\npreached by prophet and extolled by psalmist, that on the glad day when\r\nthe unity of God is acknowledged, all the nations of the earth will form\r\na single confederacy, banded together for love and peace.\r\n\r\nThe open-eyed student of Jewish history, in which the Falashas form a\r\nvery small chapter, cannot fail to note with reverence the power and\r\nsacredness of its genius. The race, the faith, the confession, all is\r\nunparalleled. Everything about it is wonderful--from Abraham at Ur of\r\nthe Chaldees shattering his father's idols and proclaiming the unity of\r\nGod, down to Moses teaching awed mankind the highest ethical lessons\r\nfrom the midst of the thunders and flames of Sinai; to the heroes and\r\nseers, whose radiant visions are mankind's solace; to the sweet singers\r\nof Israel extolling the virtues of men in hymns and songs; to the\r\nMaccabean heroes struggling to throw off the Syrian yoke; to venerable\r\nrabbis proof against the siren notes of Hellenism; to the gracious bards\r\nand profound thinkers of Andalusia. The genius of Jewish history is\r\nnever at rest. From the edge of the wilderness it sweeps on to the lands\r\nof civilization, where thousands of martyrs seal the confession of God's\r\nunity with death on ruddy pyres; on through tears and blood, over\r\nnations, across thrones, until the sun of culture, risen to its zenith,\r\nsends its rays even into the dark Ghetto, where a drama enacts itself,\r\nmelancholy, curious, whose last act is being played under our very eyes.\r\nBranch after branch is dropping from the timeworn, weatherbeaten trunk.\r\nThe ground is thickly strewn with dry leaves. Vitality that resisted\r\nrain and storm seems to be blasted by sunshine. Yet we need not despair.\r\nThe genius of Jewish history has the balsam of consolation to offer. It\r\nbids us read in the old documents of Israel's spiritual struggles, and\r\ncalls to our attention particularly a parable in the Midrash, written\r\nwhen the need for its telling was as sore as to-day: A wagon loaded with\r\nglistening axes was driven through the woods. Plaintive cries arose from\r\nthe trees: \"Woe, woe, there is no escape for us, we are doomed to swift\r\ndestruction.\" A solitary oak towering high above the other trees stood\r\ncalm, motionless. Many a spring had decked its twigs with tender,\r\nsucculent green. At last it speaks; all are silent, and listen\r\nrespectfully: \"Possess yourselves in peace. All the axes in the world\r\ncannot harm you, if you do not provide them with handles.\"\r\n\r\nSo every weapon shaped to the injury of the ancient tree of Judaism will\r\nrecoil ineffectual, unless her sons and adherents themselves furnish the\r\nhaft. There is consolation in the thought. Even in sad days it feeds the\r\nhope that the time will come, whereof the prophet spoke, when \"all thy\r\nchildren shall be disciples of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of\r\nthy children.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA JEWISH KING IN POLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a legend that a Jewish king once reigned in Poland. It never\r\noccurs to my mind without at the same time conjuring before me two\r\nfigures. The one is that charming creation of Ghetto fancy, old Malkoh\r\n\"with the stout heart,\" in Aaron Bernstein's _Mendel Gibbor_, who\r\nintroduces herself with the proud boast: _Wir sennen von koeniglichein\r\nGebluet_ (\"We are of royal descent\"). The other is a less ideal, less\r\nattractive Jew, whom I overheard in the Casimir, the Jewish quarter at\r\nCracow, in altercation with another Jew. The matter seemed of vital\r\ninterest to the disputants. The one affirmed, the other denied as\r\nvigorously, and finally silenced his opponent with the contemptuous\r\nargument: \"Well, and if it comes about, it will last just as long as\r\nSaul Wahl's _Malchus_ (reign).\"\r\n\r\nLegend has always been the companion of history. For each age it creates\r\na typical figure, in which are fixed, for the information of future\r\ntimes, the fleeting, subtle emotions as well as the permanent effects\r\nproduced by historical events, and this constitutes the value of\r\nlegendary lore in tracing the development and characteristics of a\r\npeople. At the same time its magic charms connect the links in the chain\r\nof generations.\r\n\r\nThe legend about Saul Wahl to be known and appreciated must first be\r\ntold as it exists, then traced through its successive stages, its\r\nhistorical kernel disentangled from the accretions of legend-makers,\r\nSaul, the man of flesh and blood discovered, and the ethical lessons it\r\nhas to teach derived.\r\n\r\nIn 1734, more than a century after Saul's supposed reign, his\r\ngreat-grandson, Rabbi Pinchas, resident successively in Leitnik,\r\nBoskowitz, Wallerstein, Schwarzburg, Marktbreit, and Anspach, related\r\nthe story of his ancestor: \"Rabbi Samuel Judah's son was the great Saul\r\nWahl of blessed memory. All learned in such matters well know that his\r\nsurname _Wahl_ (choice) was given him, because he was chosen king in\r\nPoland by the unanimous vote of the noble electors of the land. I was\r\ntold by my father and teacher, of blessed memory, that the choice fell\r\nupon him in this wise: Saul Wahl was a favorite with Polish noblemen,\r\nand highly esteemed for his shrewdness and ability. The king of Poland\r\nhad died. Now it was customary for the great nobles of Poland to\r\nassemble for the election of a new king on a given day, on which it was\r\nimperative that a valid decision be reached. When the day came, many\r\nopinions were found to prevail among the electors, which could not be\r\nreconciled. Evening fell, and they realized the impossibility of\r\nelecting a king on the legally appointed day. Loth to transgress their\r\nown rule, the nobles agreed to make Saul Wahl king for the rest of that\r\nday and the following night, and thus conform with the letter of the\r\nlaw. And so it was. Forthwith all paid him homage, crying out in their\r\nown language: 'Long live our lord and king!' Saul, loaded with royal\r\nhonors, reigned that night. I heard from my father that they gave into\r\nhis keeping all the documents in the royal archives, to which every king\r\nmay add what commands he lists, and Wahl inscribed many laws and decrees\r\nof import favorable to Jews. My father knew some of them; one was that\r\nthe murderer of a Jew, like the murderer of a nobleman, was to suffer\r\nthe death penalty. Life was to be taken for life, and no ransom\r\nallowed--a law which, in Poland, had applied only to the case of\r\nChristians of the nobility. The next day the electors came to an\r\nagreement, and chose a ruler for Poland.--That this matter may be\r\nremembered, I will not fail to set forth the reasons why Saul Wahl\r\nenjoyed such respect with the noblemen of Poland, which is the more\r\nremarkable as his father, Rabbi Samuel Judah, was rabbi first at Padua\r\nand then at Venice, and so lived in Italy. My father told me how it came\r\nabout. In his youth, during his father's lifetime, Saul Wahl conceived a\r\ndesire to travel in foreign parts. He left his paternal home in Padua,\r\nand journeying from town to town, from land to land, he at last reached\r\nBrzesc in Lithuania. There he married the daughter of David Drucker, and\r\nhis pittance being small, he led but a wretched life.\r\n\r\nIt happened at this time that the famous, wealthy prince, Radziwill, the\r\nfavorite of the king, undertook a great journey to see divers lands, as\r\nis the custom of noblemen. They travel far and wide to become\r\nacquainted with different fashions and governments. So this prince\r\njourneyed in great state from land to land, until his purse was empty.\r\nHe knew not what to do, for he would not discover his plight to the\r\nnobles of the land in which he happened to be; indeed, he did not care\r\nto let them know who he was. Now, he chanced to be in Padua, and he\r\nresolved to unbosom himself to the rabbi, tell him that he was a great\r\nnoble of the Polish land, and borrow somewhat to relieve his pressing\r\nneed. Such is the manner of Polish noblemen. They permit shrewd and\r\nsensible Jews to become intimate with them that they may borrow from\r\nthem, rabbis being held in particularly high esteem and favor by the\r\nprinces and lords of Poland. So it came about that the aforesaid Prince\r\nRadziwill sought out Rabbi Samuel Judah, and revealed his identity, at\r\nthe same time discovering to him his urgent need of money. The rabbi\r\nlent him the sum asked for, and the prince said, 'How can I recompense\r\nyou, returning good for good?' The rabbi answered, 'First I beg that you\r\ndeal kindly with the Jews under your power, and then that you do the\r\ngood you would show me to my son Saul, who lives in Brzesc.' The prince\r\ntook down the name and place of abode of the rabbi's son, and having\r\narrived at his home, sent for him. He appeared before the prince, who\r\nfound him so wise and clever that he in every possible way attached the\r\nJew to his own person, gave him many proofs of his favor, sounded his\r\npraises in the ears of all the nobles, and raised him to a high\r\nposition. He was so great a favorite with all the lords that on the day\r\nwhen a king was to be elected, and the peers could not agree, rather\r\nthan have the day pass without the appointment of a ruler, they\r\nunanimously resolved to invest Saul with royal power, calling him Saul\r\nWahl to indicate that he had been _chosen_ king.--All this my father\r\ntold me, and such new matter as I gathered from another source, I will\r\nnot fail to set down in another chapter.\"--\r\n\r\n\"This furthermore I heard from my pious father, when, in 1734, he lay\r\nsick in Fuerth, where there are many physicians. I went from Marktbreit\r\nto Fuerth, and stayed with him for three weeks. When I was alone with\r\nhim, he dictated his will to me, and then said in a low voice: 'This I\r\nwill tell you that you may know what happened to our ancestor Saul Wahl:\r\nAfter the nobles had elected a king for Poland, and our ancestor had\r\nbecome great in the eyes of the Jews, he unfortunately grew haughty. He\r\nhad a beautiful daughter, Haendele, famed throughout Poland for her wit\r\nas well as her beauty. Many sought her in marriage, and among her\r\nsuitors was a young Talmudist, the son of one of the most celebrated\r\nrabbis. (My father did not mention the name, either because he did not\r\nknow, or because he did not wish to say it, or mayhap he had forgotten\r\nit.) The great rabbi himself came to Brzesc with his learned son to urge\r\nthe suit. They both lodged with the chief elder of the congregation.\r\nBut the pride of our ancestor was overweening. In his heart he\r\nconsidered himself the greatest, and his daughter the best, in the land,\r\nand he said that his daughter must marry one more exalted than this\r\nsuitor. Thus he showed his scorn for a sage revered in Israel and for\r\nhis son, and these two were sore offended at the discourtesy. The Jewish\r\ncommunity had long been murmuring against our ancestor Saul Wahl, and it\r\nwas resolved to make amends for his unkindness. One of the most\r\nrespected men in the town gave his daughter to the young Talmudist for\r\nwife, and from that day our ancestor had enemies among his people, who\r\nconstantly sought to do him harm. It happened at that time that the wife\r\nof the king whom the nobles had chosen died, and several Jews of Brzesc,\r\nin favor with the powerful of the land, in order to administer\r\npunishment to Saul Wahl, went about among the nobles praising his\r\ndaughter for her exceeding beauty and cleverness, and calling her the\r\nworthiest to wear the queenly crown. One of the princes being kindly\r\ndisposed to Saul Wahl betrayed their evil plot, and it was\r\nfrustrated.'\"[72]\r\n\r\nRabbi Pinchas' ingenuous narrative, charming in its simple directness,\r\ncloses wistfully: \"He who has not seen that whole generation, Saul Wahl\r\namid his sons, sons-in-law, and grandsons, has failed to see the union\r\nof the Law with mundane glory, of wealth with honor and princely\r\nrectitude. May the Lord God bless us by permitting us to rejoice thus in\r\nour children and children's children!\"\r\n\r\nOther rabbis of that time have left us versions of the Saul Wahl legend.\r\nThey report that he founded a _Beth ha-Midrash_ (college for Jewish\r\nstudies) and a little synagogue, leaving them, together with numerous\r\nbequests, to the community in which he had lived, with the condition\r\nthat the presidency of the college be made hereditary in his family.\r\nSome add that they had seen in Brzesc a gold chain belonging to him, his\r\ncoat of arms emblazoned with the lion of Judah, and a stone tablet on\r\nwhich an account of his meritorious deeds was graven. Chain, escutcheon,\r\nand stone have disappeared, and been forgotten, the legend alone\r\nsurvives.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nNow, what has history to say?\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, an historical kernel lies hidden in the legend. Neither\r\nthe Polish chronicles of those days nor Jewish works mention a Jewish\r\nking of Poland; but from certain occurrences, hints can be gleaned\r\nsufficient to enable us to establish the underlying truth. When Stephen\r\nBathori died, Poland was hard pressed. On all sides arose pretenders to\r\nthe throne. The most powerful aspirant was Archduke Maximilian of\r\nAustria, who depended on his gold and Poland's well-known sympathy for\r\nAustria to gain him the throne. Next came the Duke of Ferrara backed by\r\na great army and the favor of the Czar, and then, headed by the\r\ncrown-prince of Sweden, a crowd of less powerful claimants, so motley\r\nthat a Polish nobleman justly exclaimed: \"If you think any one will do\r\nto wear Poland's crown upon his pate, I'll set up my coachman as king!\"\r\nGreat Poland espoused the cause of Sweden, Little Poland supported\r\nAustria, and the Lithuanians furthered the wishes of the Czar. In\r\nreality, however, the election of the king was the occasion for bringing\r\nto a crisis the conflict between the two dominant families of Zamoiski\r\nand Zborowski.\r\n\r\nThe election was to take place on August 18, 1587. The electors, armed\r\nto the teeth, appeared on the place designated for the election, a\r\nfortified camp on the Vistula, on the other side of which stood the\r\ndeputies of the claimants. Night was approaching, and the possibility of\r\nreconciling the parties seemed as remote as ever. Christopher Radziwill,\r\nthe \"castellan\" of the realm, endeavoring to make peace between the\r\nfactions, stealthily crept from camp to camp, but evening deepened into\r\nnight, and still the famous election cry, \"_Zgoda!_\" (Agreed!), was not\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nAccording to the legend, this is the night of Saul Wahl's brief royalty.\r\nIt is said that he was an agent employed by Prince Radziwill, and when\r\nthe electors could not be induced to come to an agreement, it occurred\r\nto the prince to propose Saul as a compromise-king. With shouts of \"Long\r\nlive King Saul!\" the proposal was greeted by both factions, and this is\r\nthe nucleus of the legend, which with remarkable tenacity has\r\nperpetuated itself down to our generation. For the historical truth of\r\nthe episode we have three witnesses. The chief is Prince Nicholas\r\nChristopher of Radziwill, duke of Olyka and Nieswiesz, the son of the\r\nfounder of this still flourishing line of princes. His father had left\r\nthe Catholic church, and joined the Protestants, but he himself returned\r\nto Catholicism, and won fame by his pilgrimage to Jerusalem, described\r\nin both Polish and Latin in the work _Peregrinatio Hierosolymitana_.\r\nBesides, he offered 5000 ducats for the purchase of extant copies of the\r\nProtestant \"Radziwill Bible,\" published by his father, intending to have\r\nthem destroyed. On his return journey from the Holy Land he was attacked\r\nat Pescara by robbers, and at Ancona on a Palm Sunday, according to his\r\nown account, he found himself destitute of means. He applied to the\r\npapal governor, but his story met with incredulity. Then he appealed to\r\na Jewish merchant, offering him, as a pawn, a gold box made of a piece\r\nof the holy cross obtained in Palestine, encircled with diamonds, and\r\nbearing on its top the _Agnus dei_. The Jew advanced one hundred crowns,\r\nwhich sufficed exactly to pay his lodging and attendants. Needy as\r\nbefore, he again turned to the Jew, who gave him another hundred crowns,\r\nthis time without exacting a pledge, a glance at his papal passport\r\nhaving convinced him of the prince's identity.[73]\r\n\r\nThis is Radziwill's account in his itinerary. As far as it goes, it\r\nbears striking similarity to the narrative of Rabbi Pinchas of Anspach,\r\nand leads to the certain conclusion that the legend rests upon an\r\nhistorical substratum. A critic has justly remarked that the most vivid\r\nfancy could not, one hundred and thirty-one years after their\r\noccurrence, invent, in Anspach, the tale of a Polish magnate's\r\nadventures in Italy. Again, it is highly improbable that Saul Wahl's\r\ngreat-grandson read Prince Radziwill's Latin book, detailing his\r\nexperiences to his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nThere are other witnesses to plead for the essential truth of our\r\nlegend. The rabbis mentioned before have given accounts of Saul's\r\nposition, of his power, and the splendor of his life. Negative signs, it\r\nis true, exist, arguing against the historical value of the legend.\r\nPolish history has not a word to say about the ephemeral king. In fact,\r\nthere was no day fixed for the session of the electoral diet. Moreover,\r\ncritics might adduce against the probability of its correctness the\r\nhumble station of the Jews, and the low esteem in which the Radziwills\r\nwere then held by the Polish nobility. But it is questionable whether\r\nthese arguments are sufficiently convincing to strip the Saul Wahl\r\nlegend of all semblance of truth. Polish historians are hardly fair in\r\nignoring the story. Though it turn out to have been a wild prank, it has\r\nsome historical justification. Such practical jokes are not unusual in\r\nPolish history. Readers of that history will recall the _Respublika\r\nBabinska_, that society of practical jokers which drew up royal\r\ncharters, and issued patents of nobility. A Polish nobleman had founded\r\nthe society in the sixteenth century, its membership being open only to\r\nthose distinguished as wits. It perpetrated the oddest political jokes,\r\nappointing spendthrifts as overseers of estates, and the most\r\nquarrelsome as justices of the peace. With such proclivities, Polish\r\nfactions, at loggerheads with each other, can easily be imagined uniting\r\nto crown a Jew, the most harmless available substitute for a real king.\r\n\r\nOur last and strongest witness--one compelling the respectful attention\r\nof the severest court and the most incisive attorney general--is the\r\nRussian professor Berschadzky, the author of an invaluable work on the\r\nhistory of the Jews in Lithuania. He vouches, not indeed for the\r\nauthenticity of the events related by Rabbi Pinchas, but for the reality\r\nof Saul Wahl himself. From out of the Russian archives he has been\r\nresurrected by Professor Berschadzky, the first to establish that Saul\r\nwas a man of flesh and blood.[74] He reproduces documents of\r\nincontestable authority, which report that Stephen Bathori, in the year\r\n1578, the third of his reign, awarded the salt monopoly for the whole of\r\nPoland to Saul Juditsch, that is, Saul the Jew. Later, upon the payment\r\nof a high security, the same Saul the Jew became farmer of the imposts.\r\nIn 1580, his name, together with the names of the heads of the Jewish\r\ncommunity of Brzesc, figures in a lawsuit instituted to establish the\r\nclaim of the Jews upon the fourth part of all municipal revenues. He\r\nrests the claim on a statute of Grandduke Withold, and the verdict was\r\nfavorable to his side. This was the time of the election of Bathori's\r\nsuccessor, Sigismund III., and after his accession to the throne, Saul\r\nJuditsch again appears on the scene. On February 11, 1588, the king\r\nissued the following notice: \"Some of our councillors have recommended\r\nto our attention the punctilious business management of Saul Juditsch,\r\nof the town of Brzesc, who, on many occasions during the reigns of our\r\npredecessors, served the crown by his wide experience in matters\r\npertaining to duties, taxes, and divers revenues, and advanced the\r\nfinancial prosperity of the realm by his conscientious efforts.\" Saul\r\nwas now entrusted, for a period of ten years, with the collection of\r\ntaxes on bridges, flour, and brandies, paying 150,000 gold florins for\r\nthe privilege. A year later he was honored with the title _sluga\r\nkrolewski_, \"royal official,\" a high rank in the Poland of the day, as\r\ncan be learned from the royal decree conferring it: \"We, King of Poland,\r\nhaving convinced ourself of the rare zeal and distinguished ability of\r\nSaul Juditsch, do herewith grant him a place among our royal officials,\r\nand that he may be assured of our favor for him we exempt him and his\r\nlands for the rest of his life from subordination to the jurisdiction of\r\nany 'castellan,' or any municipal court, or of any court in our land, of\r\nwhatever kind or rank it may be; so that if he be summoned before the\r\ncourt of any judge or district, in any matter whatsoever, be it great or\r\nsmall, criminal or civil, he is not obliged to appear and defend\r\nhimself. His goods may not be distrained, his estates not used as\r\nsecurity, and he himself can neither be arrested, nor kept a prisoner.\r\nHis refusal to appear before a judge or to give bail shall in no wise be\r\npunishable; he is amenable to no law covering such cases. If a charge be\r\nbrought against him, his accusers, be they our subjects or aliens, of\r\nany rank or calling whatsoever, must appeal to ourself, the king, and\r\nSaul Juditsch shall be in honor bound to appear before us and defend\r\nhimself.\"\r\n\r\nThis royal patent was communicated to all the princes, lords,\r\n_voivodes_, marshals, \"castellans,\" starosts, and lower officials, in\r\ntown and country, and to the governors and courts of Poland. Saul\r\nJuditsch's name continues to appear in the state documents. In 1593, he\r\npleads for the Jews of Brzesc, who desire to have their own\r\njurisdiction. In consequence of his intercession, Sigismund III. forbids\r\nthe _voivodes_ (mayors) and their proxies to interfere in the quarrels\r\nof the Jews, of whatever kind they may be. The last mention of Saul\r\nJuditsch's name occurs in the records of 1596, when, in conjunction with\r\nhis Christian townsmen, he pleads for the renewal of an old franchise,\r\ngranted by Grandduke Withold, exempting imported goods from duty.\r\n\r\nSaul Wahl probably lived to the age of eighty, dying in the year 1622.\r\nThe research of the historian has established his existence beyond a\r\nperadventure. He has proved that there was an individual by the name of\r\nSaul Wahl, and that is a noteworthy fact in the history of Poland and in\r\nthat of the Jews in the middle ages.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nAfter history, criticism has a word to say. A legend, as a rule, rests\r\non analogy, on remarkable deeds, on notable events, on extraordinary\r\nhistorical phenomena. In the case of the legend under consideration, all\r\nthese originating causes are combined. Since the time of Sigismund I.,\r\nthe position of the Jews in Lithuania and Poland had been favorable. It\r\nis regarded as their golden period in Poland. In general, Polish Jews\r\nhad always been more favorably situated than their brethren in faith in\r\nother countries. At the very beginning of Polish history, a legend,\r\nsimilar to that attached to Saul Wahl's name, sprang up. After the death\r\nof Popiel, an assembly met at Kruszwica to fill the vacant throne. No\r\nagreement could be reached, and the resolution was adopted to hail as\r\nking the first person to enter the town the next morning. The guard\r\nstationed at the gate accordingly brought before the assembly the poor\r\nJew Abraham, with the surname Powdermaker (_Prochownik_), which he had\r\nreceived from his business, the importing of powder. He was welcomed\r\nwith loud rejoicing, and appointed king. But he refused the crown, and\r\npressed to accept it, finally asked for a night's delay to consider the\r\nproposal. Two days and two nights passed, still the Jew did not come\r\nforth from his room. The Poles were very much excited, and a peasant,\r\nPiast by name, raising his voice, cried out: \"No, no, this will not do!\r\nThe land cannot be without a head, and as Abraham does not come out, I\r\nwill bring him out.\" Swinging his axe, he rushed into the house, and\r\nled the trembling Jew before the crowd. With ready wit, Abraham said,\r\n\"Poles, here you see the peasant Piast, he is the one to be your king.\r\nHe is sensible, for he recognized that a land may not be without a king.\r\nBesides, he is courageous; he disregarded my command not to enter my\r\nhouse. Crown him, and you will have reason to be grateful to God and His\r\nservant Abraham!\" So Piast was proclaimed king, and he became the\r\nancestor of a great dynasty.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to discover how much of truth is contained in this\r\nlegend of the tenth century. That it in some remote way rests upon\r\nhistorical facts is attested by the existence of Polish coins bearing\r\nthe inscriptions: \"Abraham _Dux_\" and \"_Zevach_ Abraham\" (\"Abraham the\r\nPrince\" and \"Abraham's Sacrifice\"). Casimir the Great, whose _liaison_\r\nwith the Jewess Esterka has been shown by modern historians to be a pure\r\nfabrication, confirmed the charter of liberties (_privilegium\r\nlibertatis_) held by the Jews of Poland from early times, and under\r\nSigismund I. they prospered, materially and intellectually, as never\r\nbefore. Learning flourished among them, especially the study of the\r\nTalmud being promoted by three great men, Solomon Shachna, Solomon\r\nLuria, and Moses Isserles.\r\n\r\nHenry of Anjou, the first king elected by the Diet (1573), owed his\r\nelection to Solomon Ashkenazi, a Jewish physician and diplomat, who\r\nventured to remind the king of his services: \"To me more than to any one\r\nelse does your Majesty owe your election. Whatever was done here at the\r\nPorte, I did, although, I believe, M. d'Acqs takes all credit unto\r\nhimself.\" This same diplomat, together with the Jewish prince Joseph\r\nNasi of Naxos, was chiefly instrumental in bringing about the election\r\nof Stephen Bathori. Simon Guensburg, the head of the Jewish community of\r\nPosen, had a voice in the king's council, and Bona Sforza, the Italian\r\nprincess on the Polish throne, was in the habit of consulting with\r\nclever Jews. The papal legate Commendoni speaks in a vexed tone, yet\r\nadmiringly, of the brilliant position of Polish Jews, of their extensive\r\ncattle-breeding and agricultural interests, of their superiority to\r\nChristians as artisans, of their commercial enterprise, leading them as\r\nfar as Dantzic in the north and Constantinople in the south, and of\r\ntheir possession of that sovereign means which overcomes ruler, starost,\r\nand legate alike.[75]\r\n\r\nThese are the circumstances to be borne in mind in examining the\r\nauthenticity of the legend about the king of a night. As early as the\r\nbeginning of his century, recent historians inform us, three Jews,\r\nAbraham, Michael, and Isaac Josefowicz, rose to high positions in\r\nLithuania. Abraham was made chief rabbi of Lithuania, his residence\r\nbeing fixed at Ostrog; Isaac became starost of the cities of Smolensk\r\nand Minsk (1506), and four years later, he was invested with the\r\ngovernorship of Lithuania. He always kept up his connection with his\r\nbrothers, protected his co-religionists, and appointed Michael chief\r\nelder of the Lithuanian Jews. On taking the oath of allegiance to Albert\r\nof Prussia, he was raised to the rank of a nobleman. A Jew of the\r\nsixteenth century a nobleman! Surely, this fact is sufficiently\r\nstartling to serve as the background of a legend. We have every\r\ncircumstance necessary: An analogous legend in the early history of\r\nPoland, the favored condition of the Jews, the well-attested reality of\r\nSaul Juditsch, and an extraordinary event, the ennobling of a Jew. Saul\r\nWahl probably did not reign--not even for a single night--but he\r\ncertainly was attached to the person of the king, and later, ignorant of\r\ngrades of officials, the Jews were prone to magnify his position.\r\nIndeed, the abject misery of their condition in the seventeenth century\r\nseems better calculated to explain the legend than their prosperity in\r\nthe fifteenth and the sixteenth century. Bogdan Chmielnicki's campaign\r\nagainst the rebellious Cossacks wrought havoc among the Jews. From the\r\nsouthern part of the Ukraine to Lemberg, the road was strewn with the\r\ncorpses of a hundred thousand Jews. The sad memory of a happy past is\r\nthe fertile soil in which legends thrive. It is altogether likely that\r\nat this time of degradation the memory of Saul Wahl, redeemer and hero,\r\nwas first celebrated, and the report of his coat of arms emblazoned with\r\na lion clutching a scroll of the Law, and crowning an eagle, of his\r\ngolden chain, of his privileges, and all his memorials, spread from\r\nhouse to house.\r\n\r\nParallel cases of legend-construction readily suggest themselves. In\r\nour own time, in the glare of nineteenth century civilization, legends\r\noriginate in the same way. Here is a case in point: In 1875, the\r\nAnthropological Society of Western Prussia instituted a series of\r\ninvestigations, in the course of which the complexion and the color of\r\nthe hair and eyes of the children at the public schools were to be\r\nnoted, in order to determine the prevalence of certain racial traits.\r\nThe most extravagant rumors circulated in the districts of Dantzic,\r\nThorn, Kulm, all the way to Posen. Parents, seized by unreasoning\r\nterror, sent their children, in great numbers, to Russia. One rumor said\r\nthat the king of Prussia had lost one thousand blonde children to the\r\nsultan over a game of cards; another, that the Russian government had\r\nsold sixty thousand pretty girls to an Arab prince, and to save them\r\nfrom the sad fate conjectured to be in store for them, all the pretty\r\ngirls at Dubna were straightway married off.--Similarly, primitive man,\r\nto satisfy his intellectual cravings, explained the phenomena of the\r\nheavens, the earth, and the waters by legends and myths, the germs of\r\npolytheistic nature religions. In our case, the tissue of facts is\r\ndifferent, the process the same.\r\n\r\nBut legends express the idealism of the masses; they are the highest\r\nmanifestations of spiritual life. The thinker's flights beyond the\r\nconfines of reality, the inventor's gift to join old materials in new\r\ncombinations, the artist's creative impulse, the poet's inspiration, the\r\nseer's prophetic vision--every emanation from man's ideal nature clothes\r\nitself with sinews, flesh, and skin, and lives in a people's legends,\r\nthe repositories of its art, poetry, science, and ethics.\r\n\r\nLegends moreover are characteristic of a people's culture. As a child\r\ndelights in iridescent soap-bubbles, so a nation revels in\r\nreminiscences. Though poetry lend words, painting her tints,\r\narchitecture a rule, sculpture a chisel, music her tones, the legend\r\nitself is dead, and only a thorough understanding of national traits\r\nenables one to recognize its ethical bearings. From this point of view,\r\nthe legend of the Polish king of a night is an important historical\r\nargument, testifying to the satisfactory condition of the Jews of Poland\r\nin the fifteenth and the sixteenth century. The simile that compares\r\nnations, on the eve of a great revolution, to a seething crater, is true\r\ndespite its triteness, and if to any nation, is applicable to the Poland\r\nof before and after that momentous session of the Diet. Egotism, greed,\r\nambition, vindictiveness, and envy added fuel to fire, and hastened\r\ndestruction. Jealousy had planted discord between two families, dividing\r\nthe state into hostile, embittered factions. Morality was undermined,\r\nlaw trodden under foot, duty neglected, justice violated, the promptings\r\nof good sense disregarded. So it came about that the land was flooded by\r\nruin as by a mighty stream, which, a tiny spring at first, gathers\r\nstrength and volume from its tributaries, and overflowing its bounds,\r\nrushes over blooming meadows, fields, and pastures, drawing into its\r\ndestructive depths the peasant's every joy and hope. That is the soil\r\nfrom which a legend like ours sprouts and grows.\r\n\r\nThis legend distinctly conveys an ethical lesson. The persecutions of\r\nthe Jews, their ceaseless wanderings from town to town, from country to\r\ncountry, from continent to continent, have lasted two thousand years,\r\nand how many dropped by the wayside! Yet they never parted with the\r\ntriple crown placed upon their heads by an ancient sage: the crown of\r\nroyalty, the crown of the Law, and the crown of a good name. Learning\r\nand fair fame were indisputably theirs: therefore, the first, the royal\r\ncrown, never seemed more resplendent than when worn in exile. The glory\r\nof a Jewish king of the exile seemed to herald the realization of the\r\nMessianic ideal. So it happens that many a family in Poland, England,\r\nand Germany, still cherishes the memory of Rabbi Saul the king, and that\r\n\"Malkohs\" everywhere still boast of royal ancestry. Rabbis, learned in\r\nthe Law, were his descendants, and men of secular fame, Gabriel Riesser\r\namong them, proudly mention their connection, however distant, with Saul\r\nWahl. The memory of his deeds perpetuates itself in respectable Jewish\r\nhomes, where grandams, on quiet Sabbath afternoons, tell of them, as\r\nthey show in confirmation the seal on coins to an awe-struck progeny.\r\n\r\nThree crowns Israel bore upon his head. If the crown of royalty is\r\nlegendary, then the more emphatically have the other two an historical\r\nand ethical value. The crown of royalty has slipped from us, but the\r\ncrown of a good name and especially the crown of the Law are ours to\r\nkeep and bequeath to our children and our children's children unto the\r\nlatest generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEWISH SOCIETY IN THE TIME OF MENDELSSOHN\r\n\r\n\r\nOn an October day in 1743, in the third year of the reign of Frederick\r\nthe Great, a delicate lad of about fourteen begged admittance at the\r\nRosenthal gate of Berlin, the only gate by which non-resident Jews were\r\nallowed to enter the capital. To the clerk's question about his business\r\nin the city, he briefly replied: \"Study\" (_Lernen_). The boy was Moses\r\nMendelssohn, and he entered the city poor and friendless, knowing in all\r\nBerlin but one person, his former teacher Rabbi David Fraenkel. About\r\ntwenty years later, the Royal Academy of Sciences awarded him the first\r\nprize for his essay on the question: \"Are metaphysical truths\r\nsusceptible of mathematical demonstration?\" After another period of\r\ntwenty years, Mendelssohn was dead, and his memory was celebrated as\r\nthat of a \"sage like Socrates, the greatest philosophers of the day\r\nexclaiming, 'There is but one Mendelssohn!'\"--\r\n\r\nThe Jewish Renaissance of a little more than a century ago presents the\r\nwhole historic course of Judaism. Never had the condition of the Jews\r\nbeen more abject than at the time of Mendelssohn's appearance on the\r\nscene. It must be remembered that for Jews the middle ages lasted three\r\nhundred years after all other nations had begun to enjoy the blessings\r\nof the modern era. Veritable slaves, degenerate in language and habits,\r\npurchasing the right to live by a tax (_Leibzoll_), in many cities still\r\nwearing a yellow badge, timid, embittered, pale, eloquently silent, the\r\nJews herded in their Ghetto with its single Jew-gate--they, the\r\ndescendants of the Maccabees, the brethren in faith of proud Spanish\r\ngrandees, of Andalusian poets and philosophers. The congregations were\r\npoor; immigrant Poles filled the offices of rabbis and teachers, and\r\noccupied themselves solely with the discussion of recondite problems.\r\nThe evil nonsense of the Kabbalists was actively propagated by the\r\nSabbatians, and on the other hand the mystical _Chassidim_ were\r\nbeginning to perform their witches' dance. The language commonly used\r\nwas the _Judendeutsch_ (the Jewish German jargon) which, stripped of its\r\nformer literary dignity, was not much better than thieves' slang. Of\r\nsuch pitiful elements the life of the Jews was made up during the first\r\nhalf of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there burst upon them the great, overwhelming Renaissance! It\r\nseemed as though Ezekiel's vision were about to be fulfilled:[76] \"The\r\nhand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the\r\nLord, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones...\r\nthere were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very\r\ndry. And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I\r\nanswered, O Lord God, thou knowest. Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon\r\nthese bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the\r\nLord. Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones; Behold, I will cause\r\nbreath to enter into you, and ye shall live ... and ye shall know that I\r\nam the Lord. So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied,\r\nthere was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together,\r\nbone to his bone ... the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the\r\nskin covered them above: but there was no breath in them. Then said he\r\nunto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the\r\nwind, Thus saith the Lord God; Come from the four winds, O breath, and\r\nbreathe upon these slain, that they may live. So I prophesied as he\r\ncommanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood\r\nup upon their feet, an exceeding great army. Then he said unto me, Son\r\nof man, these bones are the whole house of Israel.\"\r\n\r\nIs this not a description of Israel's history in modern days? Old\r\nJudaism, seeing the marvels of the Renaissance, might well exclaim: \"Who\r\nhath begotten me these?\" and many a pious mind must have reverted to the\r\nancient words of consolation: \"I remember unto thee the kindness of thy\r\nyouth, the love of thy espousals, thy going after me in the wilderness,\r\nthrough a land that is not sown.\"\r\n\r\nIn the face of so radical a transformation, Herder, poet and thinker,\r\nreached the natural conclusion that \"such occurrences, such a history\r\nwith all its concomitant and dependent circumstances, in brief, such a\r\nnation cannot be a lying invention. Its development is the greatest poem\r\nof all times, and still unfinished, will probably continue until every\r\npossibility hidden in the soul life of humanity shall have obtained\r\nexpression.\"[77]\r\n\r\nAn unparalleled revival had begun; and in Germany, in which it made\r\nitself felt as an effect of the French Revolution, it is coupled first\r\nand foremost with the name of Moses Mendelssohn.\r\n\r\nSociety as conceived in these modern days is based upon men's relations\r\nto their families, their disciples, and their friends. They are the\r\nthree elements that determine a man's usefulness as a social factor. Our\r\nfirst interest, then, is to know Mendelssohn in his family.[78] Many\r\nyears were destined to elapse, after his coming to Berlin, before he was\r\nto win a position of dignity. When, a single ducat in his pocket, he\r\nfirst reached Berlin, the reader remembers, he was a pale-faced, fragile\r\nboy. A contemporary of his relates: \"In 1746 I came to Berlin, a\r\npenniless little chap of fourteen, and in the Jewish school I met Moses\r\nMendelssohn. He grew fond of me, taught me reading and writing, and\r\noften shared his scanty meals with me. I tried to show my gratitude by\r\ndoing him any small service in my power. Once he told me to fetch him a\r\nGerman book from some place or other. Returning with the book in hand, I\r\nwas met by one of the trustees of the Jewish poor fund. He accosted me,\r\nnot very gently, with, 'What have you there? I venture to say a German\r\nbook!' Snatching it from me, and dragging me to the magistrate's, he\r\ngave orders to expel me from the city. Mendelssohn, learning my fate,\r\ndid everything possible to bring about my return; but his efforts were\r\nof no avail.\" It is interesting to know that it was the grandfather of\r\nHerr von Bleichroeder who had to submit to so relentless a fate.\r\n\r\nGerman language and German writing Mendelssohn acquired by his unaided\r\nefforts. With the desultory assistance of a Dr. Kisch, a Jewish\r\nphysician, he learnt Latin from a book picked up at a second-hand book\r\nstall. General culture was at that time an unknown quantity in the\r\npossibilities of Berlin Jewish life. The schoolmasters, who were not\r\npermitted to stay in the city more than three years, were for the most\r\npart Poles. One Pole, Israel Moses, a fine thinker and mathematician,\r\nbanished from his native town, Samosz, on account of his devotion to\r\nsecular studies, lived with Aaron Gumpertz, the only one of the famous\r\nfamily of court-Jews who had elected a better lot. From the latter,\r\nMendelssohn imbibed a taste for the sciences, and to him he owed some\r\ndirection in his studies; while in mathematics he was instructed by\r\nIsrael Samosz, at the time when the latter, busily engaged with his\r\ngreat commentary on Yehuda Halevi's _Al-Chazari_, was living at the\r\nhouse of the Itzig family, on the _Burgstrasse_, on the very spot where\r\nthe talented architect Hitzig, the grandson of Mendelssohn's\r\ncontemporary, built the magnificent Exchange. To enable himself to buy\r\nbooks, Mendelssohn had to deny himself food. As soon as he had hoarded a\r\nfew _groschen_, he stealthily slunk to a dealer in second-hand books. In\r\nthis way he managed to possess himself of a Latin grammar and a wretched\r\nlexicon. Difficulties did not exist for him; they vanished before his\r\nindustry and perseverance. In a short time he knew far more than\r\nGumpertz himself, who has become famous through his entreaty to Magister\r\nGottsched at Leipsic, whilom absolute monarch in German literature: \"I\r\nwould most respectfully supplicate that it may please your worshipful\r\nHighness to permit me to repair to Leipsic to pasture on the meadows of\r\nlearning under your Excellency's protecting wing.\"\r\n\r\nAfter seven years of struggle and privation, Moses Mendelssohn became\r\ntutor at the house of Isaac Bernhard, a silk manufacturer, and now began\r\nbetter times. In spite of faithful performance of duties, he found\r\nleisure to acquire a considerable stock of learning. He began to\r\nfrequent social gatherings, his friend Dr. Gumpertz introducing him to\r\npeople of culture, among others to some philosophers, members of the\r\nBerlin Academy. What smoothed the way for him more than his sterling\r\ncharacter and his fine intellect was his good chess-playing. The Jews\r\nhave always been celebrated as chess-players, and since the twelfth\r\ncentury a literature in Hebrew prose and verse has grown up about the\r\ngame. Mendelssohn in this respect, too, was the heir of the peculiar\r\ngifts of his race.\r\n\r\nIn a little room two flights up in a house next to the Nicolai\r\nchurchyard lived one of the acquaintances made by Mendelssohn through\r\nDr. Gumpertz, a young newspaper writer--Gotthold Ephraim Lessing.\r\nLessing was at once strongly attracted by the young man's keen,\r\nuntrammelled mind. He foresaw that Mendelssohn would \"become an honor to\r\nhis nation, provided his fellow-believers permit him to reach his\r\nintellectual maturity. His honesty and his philosophic bent make me see\r\nin him a second Spinoza, equal to the first in all but his errors.\"[79]\r\nThrough Lessing, Mendelssohn formed the acquaintance of Nicolai, and as\r\nthey were close neighbors, their friendship developed into intimacy.\r\nNicolai induced him to take up the study of Greek, and old Rector Damm\r\ntaught him.\r\n\r\nAt this time (1755), the first coffee-house for the use of an\r\nassociation of about one hundred members, chiefly philosophers,\r\nmathematicians, physicians, and booksellers, was opened in Berlin.\r\nMendelssohn, too, was admitted, making his true entrance into society,\r\nand forming many attachments. One evening it was proposed at the club\r\nthat each of the members describe his own defects in verse; whereupon\r\nMendelssohn, who stuttered and was slightly hunchbacked, wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"Great you call Demosthenes,\r\n    Stutt'ring orator of Greece;\r\n    Hunchbacked AEsop you deem wise;--\r\n    In your circle, I surmise,\r\n    I am doubly wise and great.\r\n    What in each was separate\r\n    You in me united find,--\r\n    Hump and heavy tongue combined.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his worldly affairs prospered; he had become bookkeeper in\r\nBernhard's business. His biographer Kayserling tells us that at this\r\nperiod he was in a fair way to develop into \"a true _bel esprit_\"; he\r\ntook lessons on the piano, went to the theatre and to concerts, and\r\nwrote poems. During the winter he was at his desk at the office from\r\neight in the morning until nine in the evening. In the summer of 1756,\r\nhis work was lightened; after two in the afternoon he was his own\r\nmaster. The following year finds him comfortably established in a house\r\nof his own with a garden, in which he could be found every evening at\r\nsix o'clock, Lessing and Nicolai often joining him. Besides, he had laid\r\nby a little sum, which enabled him to help his friends, especially\r\nLessing, out of financial embarrassments. Business cares did, indeed,\r\nbear heavily upon him, and his complaints are truly touching: \"Like a\r\nbeast of burden laden down, I crawl through life, self-love\r\nunfortunately whispering into my ear that nature had perhaps mapped out\r\na poet's career for me. But what can we do, my friends? Let us pity one\r\nanother, and be content. So long as love for science is not stifled\r\nwithin us, we may hope on.\" Surely, his love for learning never\r\ndiminished. On the contrary, his zeal for philosophic studies grew, and\r\nwith it his reputation in the learned world of Berlin. The Jewish\r\nthinker finally attracted the notice of Frederick the Great, whose poems\r\nhe had had the temerity to criticise adversely in the \"Letters on\r\nLiterature\" (_Litteraturbriefe_). He says in that famous criticism:[80]\r\n\"What a loss it has been for our mother-tongue that this prince has\r\ngiven more time and effort to the French language. We should otherwise\r\npossess a treasure which would arouse the envy of our neighbors.\" A\r\ncertain Herr von Justi, who had also incurred the unfavorable notice of\r\nthe _Litteraturbriefe_, used this review to revenge himself on\r\nMendelssohn. He wrote to the Prussian state-councillor: \"A miserable\r\npublication appears in Berlin, letters on recent literature, in which a\r\nJew, criticising court-preacher Cramer, uses irreverent language in\r\nreference to Christianity, and in a bold review of _Poesies diverses_,\r\nfails to pay the proper respect to his Majesty's sacred person.\" Soon an\r\ninterdict was issued against the _Litteraturbriefe_, and Mendelssohn was\r\nsummoned to appear before the attorney general Von Uhden. Nicolai has\r\ngiven us an account of the interview between the high and mighty officer\r\nof the state and the poor Jewish philosopher:\r\n\r\nAttorney General: \"Look here! How can you venture to write against\r\nChristians?\"\r\n\r\nMendelssohn: \"When I bowl with Christians, I throw down all the pins\r\nwhenever I can.\"\r\n\r\nAttorney General: \"Do you dare mock at me? Do you know to whom you are\r\nspeaking?\"\r\n\r\nMendelssohn: \"Oh yes. I am in the presence of privy councillor and\r\nattorney general Von Uhden, a just man.\"\r\n\r\nAttorney General: \"I ask again: What right have you to write against a\r\nChristian, a court-preacher at that?\"\r\n\r\nMendelssohn: \"And I must repeat, truly without mockery, that when I play\r\nat nine-pins with a Christian, even though he be a court-preacher, I\r\nthrow down all the pins, if I can. Bowling is a recreation for my body,\r\nwriting for my mind. Writers do as well as they can.\"\r\n\r\nIn this strain the conversation continued for some time. Another version\r\nof the affair is that Mendelssohn was ordered to appear before the king\r\nat Sanssouci on a certain Saturday. When he presented himself at the\r\ngate of the palace, the officer in charge asked him how he happened to\r\nhave been honored with an invitation to come to court. Mendelssohn said:\r\n\"Oh, I am a juggler!\" In point of fact, Frederick read the objectionable\r\nreview some time later, Venino translating it into French for him. It\r\nwas probably in consequence of this vexatious occurrence that\r\nMendelssohn made application for the privilege to be considered a\r\n_Schutzjude_, that is, a Jew with rights of residence. The Marquis\r\nd'Argens who lived with the king at Potsdam in the capacity of his\r\nMajesty's philosopher-companion, earnestly supported his petition: \"_Un\r\nphilosophe mauvais catholique supplie un philosophe mauvais protestant\r\nde donner le privilege a un philosophe mauvais juif. Il y a trop de\r\nphilosophie dans tout ceci que la raison ne soit pas du cote de la\r\ndemande._\" The privilege was accorded to Mendelssohn on November 26,\r\n1763.\r\n\r\nBeing a _Schutzjude_, he could entertain the idea of marriage. Everybody\r\nis familiar with the pretty anecdote charmingly told by Berthold\r\nAuerbach. Mendelssohn's was a love-match. In April 1760, he undertook a\r\ntrip to Hamburg, and there became affianced to a \"blue-eyed maiden,\"\r\nFromet Gugenheim. The story goes that the girl shrank back startled at\r\nMendelssohn's proposal of marriage. She asked him: \"Do you believe that\r\nmatches are made in heaven?\" \"Most assuredly,\" answered Mendelssohn;\r\n\"indeed, a singular thing happened in my own case. You know that,\r\naccording to a Talmud legend, at the birth of a child, the announcement\r\nis made in heaven: So and so shall marry so and so. When I was born, my\r\nfuture wife's name was called out, and I was told that she would\r\nunfortunately be terribly humpbacked. 'Dear Lord,' said I, 'a deformed\r\ngirl easily gets embittered and hardened. A girl ought to be beautiful.\r\nDear Lord! Give me the hump, and let the girl be pretty, graceful,\r\npleasing to the eye.'\"\r\n\r\nHis engagement lasted a whole year. He was naturally desirous to improve\r\nhis worldly position; but never did it occur to him to do so at the\r\nexpense of his immaculate character. Veitel Ephraim and his associates,\r\nemployed by Frederick the Great to debase the coin of Prussia, made him\r\nbrilliant offers in the hope of gaining him as their partner. He could\r\nnot be tempted, and entered into a binding engagement with Bernhard. His\r\nmarried life was happy, he was sincerely in love with his wife, and she\r\nbecame his faithful, devoted companion.\r\n\r\nSix children were the offspring of their union: Abraham, Joseph, Nathan,\r\nDorothea, Henriette, and Recha. In Moses Mendelssohn's house, the one in\r\nwhich these children grew up, the barriers between the learned world and\r\nBerlin general society first fell. It was the rallying place of all\r\nseeking enlightenment, of all doing battle in the cause of\r\nenlightenment. The rearing of his children was a source of great anxiety\r\nto Mendelssohn, whose means were limited. One day, shortly before his\r\ndeath, Mendelssohn, walking up and down before his house in Spandauer\r\nstreet, absorbed in meditation, was met by an acquaintance, who asked\r\nhim: \"My dear Mr. Mendelssohn, what is the matter with you? You look so\r\ntroubled.\" \"And so I am,\" he replied; \"I am thinking what my children's\r\nfate will be, when I am gone.\"\r\n\r\nMoses Mendelssohn was wholly a son of his age, which perhaps explains\r\nthe charm of his personality. His faults as well as his fine traits\r\nmust be accounted for by the peculiarities of his generation. From this\r\npoint of view, we can understand his desire to have his daughters make a\r\nwealthy match. On the other hand, he could not have known, and if he had\r\nknown, he could not have understood, that his daughters, touched by the\r\nbreath of a later time, had advanced far beyond his position. The Jews\r\nof that day, particularly Jewish women, were seized by a mighty longing\r\nfor knowledge and culture. They studied French, read Voltaire, and drew\r\ninspiration from the works of the English freethinkers. One of those\r\nwomen says: \"We all would have been pleased to be heroines of romance;\r\nthere was not one of us who did not rave over some hero or heroine of\r\nfiction.\" At the head of this band of enthusiasts stood Dorothea\r\nMendelssohn, brilliant, captivating, and gifted with a vivid\r\nimagination. She was the leader, the animating spirit of her companions.\r\nTo the reading-club organized by her efforts all the restless minds\r\nbelonged. In the private theatricals at the houses of rich Jews, she\r\nfilled the principal roles; and the mornings after her social triumphs\r\nfound her a most attentive listener to her father, who was in the habit\r\nof holding lectures for her and her brother Joseph, afterward published\r\nunder the name _Morgenstunden_. And this was the girl whom her father\r\nwished to see married at sixteen. When a rich Vienna banker was proposed\r\nas a suitable match, he said, \"Ah! a man like Eskeles would greatly\r\nplease my pride!\" Dorothea did marry Simon Veit, a banker, a worthy\r\nman, who in no way could satisfy the demands of her impetuous nature.\r\nYet her father believed her to be a happy wife. In her thirtieth year\r\nshe made the acquaintance, at the house of her friend Henriette Herz, of\r\na young man, five years her junior, who was destined to change the\r\ncourse of her whole life. This was Friedrich von Schlegel, the chief of\r\nthe romantic movement. Dorothea Veit, not beautiful, fascinated him by\r\nher brilliant wit. Under Schleiermacher's encouragement, the relation\r\nbetween the two quickly assumed a serious aspect. But it was not until\r\nlong after her father's death that Dorothea abandoned her husband and\r\nchildren, and became Schlegel's life-companion, first his mistress,\r\nlater his wife. As Gutzkow justly says, his novel \"Lucinde\" describes\r\nthe relation in which Schlegel \"permitted himself to be discovered. Love\r\nfor Schlegel it was that consumed her, and led her to share with him a\r\nthousand follies--Catholicism, Brahmin theosophy, absolutism, and the\r\nChristian asceticism of which she was a devotee at the time of her\r\ndeath.\" Neither distress, nor misery, nor care, nor sorrow could\r\nalienate her affections. Finally, she became a bigoted Catholic, and in\r\nVienna, their last residence, the daughter of Moses Mendelssohn was\r\nseen, a lighted taper in her hand, one of a Catholic procession wending\r\nits way to St. Stephen's Cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe other daughter had a similar career. Henriette Mendelssohn filled a\r\nposition as governess first in Vienna, then in Paris. In the latter\r\ncity, her home was the meeting-place of the most brilliant men and\r\nwomen. She, too, denied her father and her faith. Recha, the youngest\r\ndaughter, was the unhappy wife of a merchant of Strelitz. Later on she\r\nsupported herself by keeping a boarding-school at Altona. Nathan, the\r\nyoungest son, was a mechanician; Abraham, the second, the father of the\r\nfamous composer, Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, established with the\r\noldest, Joseph, a still flourishing banking-business. Abraham's children\r\nand grandchildren all became converts to Christianity, but Moses and\r\nFromet died before their defection from the old faith. Fromet lived to\r\nsee the development of the passion for music which became hereditary in\r\nthe family. It is said that when, at the time of the popularity of\r\nSchulz's \"Athalia,\" one of the choruses, with the refrain _tout\r\nl'univers_, was much sung by her children, the old lady cried out\r\nirritably, \"_Wie mies ist mir vor tout l'univers_\" (\"How sick I am of\r\n'all the world!'\").[81]\r\n\r\nTo say apologetically that the circumstances of the times produced such\r\nfeeling and action may be a partial defense of these women, but it is\r\nnot the truth. Henriette Mendelssohn's will is a characteristic\r\ndocument. The introduction runs thus: \"In these the last words I address\r\nto my dear relatives, I express my gratitude for all their help and\r\naffection, and also that they in no wise hindered me in the practice of\r\nmy religion. I have only myself to blame if the Lord God did not deem me\r\nworthy to be the instrument for the conversion of all my brothers and\r\nsisters to the Catholic Church, the only one endowed with saving grace.\r\nMay the Lord Jesus Christ grant my prayer, and bless them all with the\r\nlight of His countenance. Amen!\" Such were the sentiments of Moses\r\nMendelssohn's daughters!\r\n\r\nThe sons inclined towards Protestantism. Abraham is reported to have\r\nsaid that at first he was known as the son of his father, and later as\r\nthe father of his son. His wife was Leah Salomon, the sister of Salomon\r\nBartholdy, afterwards councillor of legation. His surname was really\r\nonly Salomon; Bartholdy he had assumed from the former owner of a garden\r\nin Koepenikerstrasse on the Spree which he had bought. To him chiefly the\r\nformal acceptance of Christianity by Abraham's family was due. When\r\nAbraham hesitated about having his children baptized, Bartholdy wrote:\r\n\"You say that you owe it to your father's memory (not to abandon\r\nJudaism). Do you think that you are committing a wrong in giving your\r\nchildren a religion which you and they consider the better? In fact, you\r\nwould be paying a tribute to your father's efforts in behalf of true\r\nenlightenment, and he would have acted for your children as you have\r\nacted for them, perhaps for himself as I am acting for myself.\" This\r\ncertainly is the climax of frivolity! So it happened that one of\r\nMendelssohn's grandsons, Philip Veit, became a renowned Catholic church\r\npainter, and another, Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, one of the most\r\ncelebrated of Protestant composers.\r\n\r\nAfter his family, we are interested in the philosopher's disciples. They\r\nare men of a type not better, but different. What in his children sprang\r\nfrom impulsiveness and conviction, was due to levity and imitativeness\r\nin his followers. Mendelssohn's co-workers and successors formed the\r\nschool of _Biurists_, that is, expounders. In his commentary on the\r\nPentateuch he was helped by Solomon Dubno, Herz Homberg, and Hartwig\r\nWessely. Solomon Dubno, the tutor of Mendelssohn's children, was a\r\nlearned Pole, devoted heart and soul to the work on the Pentateuch. His\r\nliterary vanity having been wounded, he secretly left Mendelssohn's\r\nhouse, and could not be induced to renew his interest in the\r\nundertaking. Herz Homberg, an Austrian, took his place as tutor. When\r\nthe children were grown, he went to Vienna, and there was made imperial\r\ncouncillor, charged with the superintendence of the Jewish schools of\r\nGalicia. It is a mistake to suppose that he used efforts to further the\r\nstudy of the Talmud among Jews. From letters recently published, written\r\nby and about him, it becomes evident that he was a common informer.\r\nMendelssohn, of course, was not aware of his true character. The noblest\r\nof all was Naphtali Hartwig Wessely, a poet, a pure man, a sincere lover\r\nof mankind.\r\n\r\nThe other prominent members of Mendelssohn's circle were: Isaac Euchel,\r\nthe \"restorer of Hebrew prose,\" as he has been called, whose chief\r\npurpose was the reform of the Jewish order of service and Jewish\r\npedagogic methods; Solomon Maimon, a wild fellow, who in his\r\nautobiography tells his own misdeeds, by many of which Mendelssohn was\r\ncaused annoyance; Lazarus ben David, a modern Diogenes, the apostle of\r\nKantism; and, above all, David Friedlaender, an enthusiastic herald of\r\nthe new era, a zealous champion of modern culture, a pure, serious\r\ncharacter with high ethical ideals, whose aims, inspired though they\r\nwere by most exalted intentions, far overstepped the bounds set to him\r\nas a Jew and the disciple of Mendelssohn. Kant's philosophy found many\r\nardent adherents among the Jews at that time. Beside the old there was\r\ngrowing up a new generation which, having no obstructions placed in its\r\npath after Mendelssohn's death, aggressively asserted its principles.\r\n\r\nThe first Jew after Mendelssohn to occupy a position of prominence in\r\nthe social world of Berlin was his pupil Marcus Herz, with the title\r\nprofessor and aulic councillor, \"praised as a physician, esteemed as a\r\nphilosopher, and extolled as a prodigy in the natural sciences. His\r\nlectures on physics, delivered in his own house, were attended by\r\nmembers of the highest aristocracy, even by royal personages.\"\r\n\r\nIn circles like his, the equalization of the Jews with the other\r\ncitizens was animatedly discussed, by partisans and opponents. In the\r\ntheatre-going public, a respectable minority, having once seen \"Nathan\r\nthe Wise\" enacted, protested against the appearance upon the stage of\r\nthe trade-Jew, speaking the sing-song, drawling German vulgarly supposed\r\nto be peculiar to all Jews (_Mauscheln_). As early as 1771, Marcus Herz\r\nhad entered a vigorous protest against _mauscheln_, and at the first\r\nperformance of \"The Merchant of Venice\" on August 16, 1788, the famous\r\nactor Fleck declaimed a prologue, composed by Ramler, in which he\r\ndisavowed any intention to \"sow hatred against the Jews, the brethren in\r\nfaith of wise Mendelssohn,\" and asserted the sole purpose of the drama\r\nto be the combating of folly and vice wherever they appear.\r\n\r\nMarcus Herz's wife was Henriette Herz, and in 1790, when Alexander and\r\nWilhelm Humboldt first came to her house, the real history of the Berlin\r\n_salon_ begins. The Humboldts' acquaintance with the Herz family dates\r\nfrom the visit of state councillor Kunth, the tutor of the Humboldt\r\nbrothers, to Marcus Herz to advise with him about setting up a\r\nlightning-rod, an extraordinary novelty at the time, on the castle at\r\nTegel. Shortly afterward, Kunth introduced his two pupils to Herz and\r\nhis wife. So the Berlin _salon_ owed its origin to a lightning-rod;\r\nindeed, it may itself be called an electrical conductor for all the\r\nspiritual forces, recently brought into play, and still struggling to\r\nmanifest their undeveloped strength. Up to that time there had been\r\nnothing like society in the city of intelligence. Of course there was no\r\ndearth of scholars and clever, brilliant people, but insuperable\r\nobstacles seemed to prevent their social contact with one another.\r\nOutside of Moses Mendelssohn's house, until the end of the eighties the\r\nonly _rendezvous_ of wits, scholars, and literary men, the preference\r\nwas for magnificent banquets and noisy carousals, each rank entertaining\r\nits own members. In the middle class, the burghers, the social instinct\r\nhad not awakened at all. Alexander Humboldt significantly dated his\r\nfirst letter to Henriette Herz from _Schloss Langeweile_. In the course\r\nof time the desire for spiritual sympathy led to the formation of\r\nreading clubs and _conversazioni_. These were the elements that finally\r\nproduced Berlin society.\r\n\r\nThe prototype of the German _salon_ naturally was the _salon_ of the\r\nrococo period. Strangely enough, Berlin Jews, disciples, friends, and\r\ndescendants of Moses Mendelssohn, were the transplanters of the foreign\r\nproduct to German soil. Untrammelled as they were in this respect by\r\ntraditions, they hearkened eagerly to the new dispensation issuing from\r\nWeimar, and they were in no way hampered in the choice of their\r\nhero-guides to Olympus. Berlin irony, French sparkle, and Jewish wit\r\nmoulded the social forms which thereafter were to be characteristic of\r\nsociety at the capital, and called forth pretty much all that was\r\ncharming in the society and pleasing in the light literature of the\r\nBerlin of the day.\r\n\r\nTo judge Henriette Herz justly we must beware alike of the extravagance\r\nof her biographer and the malice of her friend Varnhagen von Ense; the\r\nformer extols her cleverness to the skies, the other degrades her to the\r\nlevel of the commonplace. The two seem equally unreliable. She was\r\nneither extremely witty nor extremely cultured. She had a singularly\r\nclear mind, and possessed the rare faculty of spreading about her an\r\natmosphere of ease and cheer--good substitutes for wit and\r\nintellectuality. Upon her beauty and amiability rested the popularity of\r\nher _salon_, which succeeded in uniting all the social factors of that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus of her social gatherings consisted of the representatives of\r\nthe old literary traditions, Nicolai, Ramler, Engel, and Moritz, and\r\nthey curiously enough attracted the theologians Spalding, Teller,\r\nZoellner, and later Schleiermacher, whose intimacy with his hostess is a\r\nmatter of history. Music was represented by Reichardt and Wesseli; art,\r\nby Schadow; and the nobility by Bernstorff, Dotina, Brinkmann, Friedrich\r\nvon Gentz, and the Humboldts. Her drawing-room was the hearth of the\r\nromantic movement, and as may be imagined, her example was followed for\r\nbetter and for worse by her friends and sisters in faith, so that by the\r\nend of the century, Berlin could boast a number of _salons_,\r\nmeeting-places of the nobility, literary men, and cultured Jews, for the\r\nfriendly exchange of spiritual and intellectual experiences. Henriette\r\nHerz's _salon_ became important not only for society in Berlin, but also\r\nfor German literature, three great literary movements being sheltered in\r\nit: the classical, the romantic, and, through Ludwig Boerne, that of\r\n\"Young Germany.\" Judaism alone was left unrepresented. In fact, she and\r\nall her cultured Jewish friends hastened to free themselves of their\r\ntroublesome Jewish affiliations, or, at least, concealed them as best\r\nthey could. Years afterwards, Boerne spent his ridicule upon the\r\nJewesses of the Berlin _salons_, with their enormous racial noses and\r\ntheir great gold crosses at their throats, pressing into Trinity church\r\nto hear Schleiermacher preach. But justice compels us to say that these\r\nwomen did not know Judaism, or knew it only in its slave's garb. Had\r\nthey had a conception of its high ethical standard, of the wealth of its\r\npoetic and philosophic thoughts, being women of rare mental gifts and\r\nbroad liberality, they certainly would not have abandoned Judaism. But\r\nthe Judaism of their Berlin, as represented by its religious teachers\r\nand the leaders of the Jewish community, most of them, according to\r\nMendelssohn's own account, immigrant Poles, could not appeal to women of\r\nkeen, intellectual sympathies, and tastes conforming to the ideals of\r\nthe new era.\r\n\r\nAs for Mendelssohn's friends who flocked to his hospitable home--their\r\nnames are household words in the history of German literature. Nicolai\r\nand Lessing must be mentioned before all others, but no one came to\r\nBerlin without seeking Moses Mendelssohn--Goethe, Herder, Wieland,\r\nHennings, Abt, Campe, Moritz, Jerusalem. Joachim Campe has left an\r\naccount of his visit at Mendelssohn's house, which is probably a just\r\npicture of its attractions.[82] He says: \"On a Friday afternoon, my wife\r\nand myself, together with some of the distinguished representatives of\r\nBerlin scholarship, visited Mendelssohn. We were chatting over our\r\ncoffee, when Mendelssohn, about an hour before sundown, rose from his\r\nseat with the words: 'Ladies and gentlemen, I must leave you to receive\r\nthe Sabbath. I shall be with you again presently; meantime my wife will\r\nenjoy your company doubly.' All eyes followed our amiable\r\nphilosopher-host with reverent admiration as he withdrew to an adjoining\r\nroom to recite the customary prayers. At the end of half an hour he\r\nreturned, his face radiant, and seating himself, he said to his wife:\r\n'Now I am again at my post, and shall try for once to do the honors in\r\nyour place. Our friends will certainly excuse you, while you fulfil your\r\nreligious duties.' Mendelssohn's wife excused herself, joined her\r\nfamily, consecrated the Sabbath by lighting the Sabbath lamp, and\r\nreturned to us. We stayed on for some hours.\" Is it possible to conceive\r\nof a more touching picture?\r\n\r\nWhen Duchess Dorothea of Kurland, and her sister Elise von der Recke\r\nwere living at Friedrichsfelde near Berlin in 1785, they invited\r\nMendelssohn, whom they were eager to know, to visit them. When dinner\r\nwas announced, Mendelssohn was not to be found. The companion of the two\r\nladies writes in her journal:[83] \"He had quietly slipped away to the\r\ninn at which he had ordered a frugal meal. From a motive entirely worthy\r\nI am sure, this philosopher never permits himself to be invited to a\r\nmeal at a Christian's house. Not to be deprived of Mendelssohn's society\r\ntoo long, the duchess rose from the table as soon as possible.\"\r\nMendelssohn returned, stayed a long time, and, on bidding adieu to the\r\nduchess, he said: \"To-day, I have had a chat with mind.\"\r\n\r\nThis was Berlin society at Mendelssohn's time, and its toleration and\r\nhumanity are the more to be valued as the majority of Jews by no means\r\nemulated Mendelssohn's enlightened example. All their energies were\r\nabsorbed in the effort of compliance with the charter of Frederick the\r\nGreat, which imposed many vexatious restrictions. On marrying, they were\r\nstill compelled to buy the inferior porcelain made by the royal\r\nmanufactory. The whole of the Jewish community continued to be held\r\nresponsible for a theft committed by one of its members. Jews were not\r\nyet permitted to become manufacturers. Bankrupt Jews, without\r\ninvestigation of each case, were considered cheats. Their use of land\r\nand waterways was hampered by many petty obstructions. In every field an\r\ninsurmountable barrier rose between them and their Christian\r\nfellow-citizens. Mendelssohn's great task was the moral and spiritual\r\nregeneration of his brethren in faith. In all disputes his word was\r\nfinal. He hoped to bring about reforms by influencing his people's inner\r\nlife. Schools were founded, and every means used to further culture and\r\neducation, but he met with much determined opposition among his\r\nfellow-believers. Of Ephraim, the debaser of the coin, we have spoken;\r\nalso of the king's manner towards Jews. Here is another instance of his\r\nbrusqueness: Abraham Posner begged for permission to shave his beard.\r\nFrederick wrote on the margin of his petition: \"_Der Jude Posner soll\r\nmich und seinen Bart ungeschoren lassen._\"\r\n\r\nLawsuits of Jews against French and German traders made a great stir in\r\nthose days. It was only after much annoyance that a naturalization\r\npatent was obtained by the family of Daniel Itzig, the father-in-law of\r\nDavid Friedlaender, founder of the Jews' Free School in Berlin. In other\r\ncases, no amount of effort could secure the patent, the king saying:\r\n\"Whatever concerns your trade is well and good. But I cannot permit you\r\nto settle tribes of Jews in Berlin, and turn it into a young\r\nJerusalem.\"--\r\n\r\nThis is a picture of Jewish society in Berlin one hundred years ago. It\r\nunited the most diverse currents and tendencies, emanating from\r\nromanticism, classicism, reform, orthodoxy, love of trade, and efforts\r\nfor spiritual regeneration. In all this queer tangle, Moses Mendelssohn\r\nalone stands untainted, his form enveloped in pure, white light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD ZUNZ[84]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are assembled for the solemn duty of paying a tribute to the memory\r\nof him whose name graces our lodge. A twofold interest attaches us to\r\nLeopold Zunz, appealing, as he does, to our local pride, and, beyond and\r\nabove that, to our Jewish feelings. Leopold Zunz was part of the Berlin\r\nof the past, every trace of which is vanishing with startling rapidity.\r\nMen, houses, streets are disappearing, and soon naught but a memory will\r\nremain of old Berlin, not, to be sure, a City Beautiful, yet filled for\r\nhim that knew it with charming associations. A precious remnant of this\r\ndear old Berlin was buried forever, when, on one misty day of the spring\r\nof 1886, we consigned to their last resting place the mortal remains of\r\nLeopold Zunz. Memorial addresses are apt to abound in such expressions\r\nas \"immortal,\" \"imperishable,\" and in flowery tributes. This one shall\r\nnot indulge in them, although to no one could they more fittingly be\r\napplied than to Leopold Zunz, a pioneer in the labyrinth of science, and\r\nthe architect of many a stately palace adorning the path but lately\r\ndiscovered by himself. Surely, such an one deserves the cordial\r\nrecognition and enduring gratitude of posterity.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that Zunz was born at Detmold (August 10, 1794), he was\r\nan integral part of old Berlin--a Berlin citizen, not by birth, but by\r\nvocation, so to speak. His being was intertwined with its life by a\r\nthousand tendrils of intellectual sympathy. The city, in turn, or, to be\r\ntopographically precise, the district between _Mauerstrasse_ and\r\n_Rosenstrasse_ knew and loved him as one of its public characters. Time\r\nwas when his witticisms leapt from mouth to mouth in the circuit between\r\nthe Varnhagen _salon_ and the synagogue in the _Heidereutergasse_,\r\neverywhere finding appreciative listeners. An observer stationed _Unter\r\nden Linden_ daily for more than thirty years might have seen a peculiar\r\ncouple stride briskly towards the _Thiergarten_ in the early afternoon.\r\nThe loungers at Spargnapani's _cafe_ regularly interrupted their endless\r\nnewspaper reading to crane their necks and say to one another, \"There go\r\nDr. Zunz and his wife.\"\r\n\r\nIn his obituary notice of the poet Mosenthal, Franz Dingelstedt\r\nroguishly says: \"He was of poor, albeit Jewish parentage.\" The same\r\napplies to Zunz, only the saying would be truer, if not so witty, in\r\nthis form: \"He was of Jewish, hence of poor, parentage.\" Among German\r\nJews throughout the middle ages and up to the first half of this\r\ncentury, poverty was the rule, a comfortable competency a rare\r\nexception, wealth an unheard of condition. But Jewish poverty was\r\nrelieved of sordidness by a precious gift of the old rabbis, who said:\r\n\"Have a tender care of the children of the poor; from them goeth forth\r\nthe Law\"; an admonition and a prediction destined to be illustrated in\r\nthe case of Zunz. Very early he lost his mother, and the year 1805 finds\r\nhim bereft of both parents, under the shelter and in the loving care of\r\nan institution founded by a pious Jew in Wolfenbuettel. Here he was\r\ntaught the best within the reach of German Jews of the day, the _alpha_\r\nand _omega_ of whose knowledge and teaching were comprised in the\r\nTalmud. The Wolfenbuettel school may be called progressive, inasmuch as a\r\nteacher, watchmaker by trade and novel-writer by vocation, was engaged\r\nto give instruction four times a week in the three R's. We may be sure\r\nthat those four lessons were not given with unvarying regularity.\r\n\r\nIn his scholastic home, Leopold Zunz met Isaac Marcus Jost, a waif like\r\nhimself, later the first Jewish historian, to whom we owe interesting\r\ndetails of Zunz's early life. In his memoirs[85] he tells the following:\r\n\"Zunz had been entered as a pupil before I arrived. Even in those early\r\ndays there were evidences of the acumen of the future critic. He was\r\ndominated by the spirit of contradiction. On the sly we studied grammar,\r\nhis cleverness helping me over many a stumbling-block. He was very\r\nwitty, and wrote a lengthy Hebrew satire on our tyrants, from which we\r\nderived not a little amusement as each part was finished. Unfortunately,\r\nthe misdemeanor was detected, and the _corpus delicti_ consigned to the\r\nflames, but the sobriquet _chotsuf_ (impudent fellow) clung to the\r\nwriter.\"\r\n\r\nIt is only just to admit that in this _Beth ha-Midrash_ Zunz laid the\r\nfoundation of the profound, comprehensive scholarship on Talmudic\r\nsubjects, the groundwork of his future achievements as a critic. The\r\ncircumstance that both these embryo historians had to draw their first\r\ninformation about history from the Jewish German paraphrase of\r\n\"Yosippon,\" an historical compilation, is counterbalanced by careful\r\ninstruction in Rabbinical literature, whose labyrinthine ways soon\r\nbecame paths of light to them.\r\n\r\nA new day broke, and in its sunlight the condition of affairs changed.\r\nIn 1808 the _Beth ha-Midrash_ was suddenly transformed into the\r\n\"Samsonschool,\" still in useful operation. It became a primary school,\r\nconducted on approved pedagogic principles, and Zunz and Jost were among\r\nthe first registered under the new, as they had been under the old,\r\nadministration. Though the one was thirteen, and the other fourteen\r\nyears old, they had to begin with the very rudiments of reading and\r\nwriting. Campe's juvenile books were the first they read. A year later\r\nfinds them engaged in secretly studying Greek, Latin, and mathematics\r\nduring the long winter evenings, by the light of bits of candles made by\r\nthemselves of drippings from the great wax tapers in the synagogue.\r\nAfter another six months, Zunz was admitted to the first class of the\r\nWolfenbuettel, and Jost to that of the Brunswick, _gymnasium_. It\r\ncharacterizes the men to say that Zunz was the first, and Jost the\r\nthird, Jew in Germany to enter a _gymnasium_. Now progress was rapid.\r\nThe classes of the _gymnasium_ were passed through with astounding ease,\r\nand in 1811, with a minimum of luggage, but a very considerable mental\r\nequipment, Zunz arrived in Berlin, never to leave it except for short\r\nperiods. He entered upon a course in philology at the newly founded\r\nuniversity, and after three years of study, he was in the unenviable\r\nposition to be able to tell himself that he had attained to--nothing.\r\n\r\nFor, to what could a cultured Jew attain in those days, unless he became\r\na lawyer or a physician? The Hardenberg edict had opened academical\r\ncareers to Jews, but when Zunz finished his studies, that provision was\r\ncompletely forgotten. So he became a preacher. A rich Jew, Jacob Herz\r\nBeer, the father of two highly gifted sons, Giacomo and Michael Beer,\r\nhad established a private synagogue in his house, and here officiated\r\nEdward Kley, C. Guensburg, J. L. Auerbach, and, from 1820 to 1822,\r\nLeopold Zunz. It is not known why he resigned his position, but to infer\r\nthat he had been forced to embrace the vocation of a preacher by the\r\nstress of circumstances is unjust. At that juncture he probably would\r\nhave chosen it, if he had been offered the rectorship of the Berlin\r\nuniversity; for, he was animated by somewhat of the spirit that urged\r\nthe prophets of old to proclaim and fulfil their mission in the midst of\r\nstorms and in despite of threatening dangers.\r\n\r\nZunz's sermons delivered from 1820 to 1822 in the first German reform\r\ntemple are truly instinct with the prophetic spirit. The breath of a\r\nmighty enthusiasm rises from the yellowed pages. Every word testifies\r\nthat they were indited by a writer of puissant individuality, disengaged\r\nfrom the shackles of conventional homiletics, and boldly striking out on\r\nuntrodden paths. In the Jewish Berlin of the day, a rationalistic,\r\nhalf-cultured generation, swaying irresolutely between Mendelssohn and\r\nSchleiermacher, these new notes awoke sympathetic echoes. But scarcely\r\nhad the music of his voice become familiar, when it was hushed. In 1823,\r\na royal cabinet order prohibited the holding of the Jewish service in\r\nGerman, as well as every other innovation in the ritual, and so German\r\nsermons ceased in the synagogue. Zunz, who had spoken like Moses, now\r\nheld his peace like Aaron, in modesty and humility, yielding to the\r\ninevitable without rancor or repining, always loyal to the exalted ideal\r\nwhich inspired him under the most depressing circumstances. He dedicated\r\nhis sermons, delivered at a time of religious enthusiasm, to \"youth at\r\nthe crossroads,\" whom he had in mind throughout, in the hope that they\r\nmight \"be found worthy to lead back to the Lord hearts, which, through\r\ndeception or by reason of stubbornness, have fallen away from Him.\"\r\n\r\nThe rescue of the young was his ideal. At the very beginning of his\r\ncareer he recognized that the old were beyond redemption, and that, if\r\nresponse and confidence were to be won from the young, the expounding of\r\nthe new Judaism was work, not for the pulpit, but for the professor's\r\nchair. \"Devotional exercises and balmy lotions for the soul\" could not\r\nheal their wounds. It was imperative to bring their latent strength into\r\nplay. Knowing this to be his pedagogic principle, we shall not go far\r\nwrong, if we suppose that in the organization of the \"Society for Jewish\r\nCulture and Science\" the initial step was taken by Leopold Zunz. In 1819\r\nwhen the mobs of Wuerzburg, Hamburg, and Frankfort-on-the-Main revived\r\nthe \"Hep, hep!\" cry, three young men, Edward Gans, Moses Moser, and\r\nLeopold Zunz conceived the idea of a society with the purpose of\r\nbringing Jews into harmony with their age and environment, not by\r\nforcing upon them views of alien growth, but by a rational training of\r\ntheir inherited faculties. Whatever might serve to promote intelligence\r\nand culture was to be nurtured: schools, seminaries, academies, were to\r\nbe erected, literary aspirations fostered, and all public-spirited\r\nenterprises aided; on the other hand, the rising generation was to be\r\ninduced to devote itself to arts, trades, agriculture, and the applied\r\nsciences; finally, the strong inclination to commerce on the part of\r\nJews was to be curbed, and the tone and conditions of Jewish society\r\nradically changed--lofty goals for the attainment of which most limited\r\nmeans were at the disposal of the projectors. The first fruits of the\r\nsociety were the \"Scientific Institute,\" and the \"Journal for the\r\nScience of Judaism,\" published in the spring of 1822, under the\r\neditorship of Zunz. Only three numbers appeared, and they met with so\r\nsmall a sale that the cost of printing was not realized. Means were\r\ninadequate, the plans magnificent, the times above all not ripe for such\r\nideals. The \"Scientific Institute\" crumbled away, too, and in 1823, the\r\nsociety was breathing its last. Zunz poured out the bitterness of his\r\ndisappointment in a letter written in the summer of 1824 to his Hamburg\r\nfriend Immanuel Wohlwill:\r\n\r\n\"I am so disheartened that I can nevermore believe in Jewish reform. A\r\nstone must be thrown at this phantasm to make it vanish. Good Jews are\r\neither Asiatics, or Christians (unconscious thereof), besides a small\r\nminority consisting of myself and a few others, the possibility of\r\nmentioning whom saves me from the imputation of conceit, though, truth\r\nto say, the bitterness of irony cares precious little for the forms of\r\ngood society. Jews, and the Judaism which we wish to reconstruct, are a\r\nprey to disunion, and the booty of vandals, fools, money-changers,\r\nidiots, and _parnassim_.[86] Many a change of season will pass over this\r\ngeneration, and leave it unchanged: internally ruptured; rushing into\r\nthe arms of Christianity, the religion of expediency; without stamina\r\nand without principle; one section thrust aside by Europe, and\r\nvegetating in filth with longing eyes directed towards the Messiah's ass\r\nor other member of the long-eared fraternity; the other occupied with\r\nfingering state securities and the pages of a cyclopaedia, and constantly\r\noscillating between wealth and bankruptcy, oppression and tolerance.\r\nTheir own science is dead among Jews, and the intellectual concerns of\r\nEuropean nations do not appeal to them, because, faithless to\r\nthemselves, they are strangers to abstract truth and slaves of\r\nself-interest. This abject wretchedness is stamped upon their\r\npenny-a-liners, their preachers, councillors, constitutions,\r\n_parnassim_, titles, meetings, institutions, subscriptions, their\r\nliterature, their book-trade, their representatives, their happiness,\r\nand their misfortune. No heart, no feeling! All a medley of prayers,\r\nbanknotes, and _rachmones_,[87] with a few strains of enlightenment and\r\n_chilluk_![88]--\r\n\r\nNow, my friend, after so revolting a sketch of Judaism, you will hardly\r\nask why the society and the journal have vanished into thin air, and are\r\nmissed as little as the temple, the school, and the rights of\r\ncitizenship. The society might have survived despite its splitting up\r\ninto sections. That was merely a mistake in management. The truth is\r\nthat it never had existence. Five or six enthusiasts met together, and\r\nlike Moses ventured to believe that their spirit would communicate\r\nitself to others. That was self-deception. _The only imperishable\r\npossession rescued from this deluge is the science of Judaism. It lives\r\neven though not a finger has been raised in its service since hundreds\r\nof years. I confess that, barring submission to the judgment of God, I\r\nfind solace only in the cultivation of the science of Judaism._\r\n\r\nAs for myself, those rough experiences of mine shall assuredly not\r\npersuade me into a course of action inconsistent with my highest\r\naspirations. I did what I held my duty. I ceased to preach, not in order\r\nto fall away from my own words, but because I realized that I was\r\npreaching in the wilderness. _Sapienti sat_.... After all that I have\r\nsaid, you will readily understand that I cannot favor an unduly\r\nostentatious mode of dissolution. Such a course would be prompted by the\r\nvanity of the puffed-out frog in the fable, and affect the Jews ... as\r\nlittle as all that has gone before. There is nothing for the members to\r\ndo but to remain unshaken, and radiate their influence in their limited\r\ncircles, leaving all else to God.\"\r\n\r\nThe man who wrote these words, it is hard to realize, had not yet passed\r\nhis thirtieth year, but his aim in life was perfectly defined. He knew\r\nthe path leading to his goal, and--most important circumstance--never\r\ndeviated from it until he attained it. His activity throughout life\r\nshows no inconsistency with his plans. It is his strength of character,\r\nrarest of attributes in a time of universal defection from the Jewish\r\nstandard, that calls for admiration, accorded by none so readily as by\r\nhis companions in arms. Casting up his own spiritual accounts, Heinrich\r\nHeine in the latter part of his life wrote of his friend Zunz:[89] \"In\r\nthe instability of a transition period he was characterized by\r\nincorruptible constancy, remaining true, despite his acumen, his\r\nscepticism, and his scholarship, to self-imposed promises, to the\r\nexalted hobby of his soul. A man of thought and action, he created and\r\nworked when others hesitated, and sank discouraged,\" or, what Heine\r\nprudently omitted to say, deserted the flag, and stealthily slunk out of\r\nthe life of the oppressed.\r\n\r\nIn Zunz, strength of character was associated with a mature, richly\r\nstored mind. He was a man of talent, of character, and of science, and\r\nthis rare union of traits is his distinction. At a time when the\r\nmajority of his co-religionists could not grasp the plain, elementary\r\nmeaning of the phrase, \"the science of Judaism,\" he made it the loadstar\r\nof his life.\r\n\r\nSad though it be, I fear that it is true that there are those of this\r\ngeneration who, after the lapse of years, are prompted to repeat the\r\nquestion put by Zunz's contemporaries, \"What is the science of Judaism?\"\r\nZunz gave a comprehensive answer in a short essay, \"On Rabbinical\r\nLiterature,\" published by Mauer in 1818:[90] \"When the shadows of\r\nbarbarism were gradually lifting from the mist-shrouded earth, and light\r\nuniversally diffused could not fail to strike the Jews scattered\r\neverywhere, a remnant of old Hebrew learning attached itself to new,\r\nforeign elements of culture, and in the course of centuries enlightened\r\nminds elaborated the heterogeneous ingredients into the literature\r\ncalled rabbinical.\" To this rabbinical, or, to use the more fitting name\r\nproposed by himself, this neo-Hebraic, Jewish literature and science,\r\nZunz devoted his love, his work, his life. Since centuries this field\r\nof knowledge had been a trackless, uncultivated waste. He who would\r\npass across, had need to be a pathfinder, robust and energetic, able to\r\nconcentrate his mind upon a single aim, undisturbed by distracting\r\ninfluences. Such was Leopold Zunz, who sketched in bold, but admirably\r\nprecise outlines the extent of Jewish science, marking the boundaries of\r\nits several departments, estimating its resources, and laying out the\r\nwork and aims of the future. The words of the prophet must have appealed\r\nto him with peculiar force: \"I remember unto thee the kindness of thy\r\nyouth, the love of thy espousals, thy going after me in the wilderness,\r\nthrough a land that is not sown.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, when there was question of cultivating the desert soil, and\r\nseeking for life under the rubbish, Zunz was the first to present\r\nhimself as a laborer. The only fruit of the Society for Jewish Culture\r\nand Science, during the three years of its existence, was the \"Journal\r\nfor the Science of Judaism,\" and its publication was due exclusively to\r\nZunz's perseverance. Though only three numbers appeared, a positive\r\naddition to our literature was made through them in Zunz's biographical\r\nessay on Rashi, the old master expounder of the Bible and the Talmud. By\r\nits arrangement of material, by its criticism and grouping of facts, and\r\nnot a little by its brilliant style, this essay became the model for all\r\nfuture work on kindred subjects. When the society dissolved, and Zunz\r\nwas left to enjoy undesired leisure, he continued to work on the lines\r\nlaid down therein. Besides, Zunz was a political journalist, for many\r\nyears political editor of \"Spener's Journal,\" and a contributor to the\r\n_Gesellschafter_, the _Iris_, _Die Freimuetigen_, and other publications\r\nof a literary character. From 1825 to 1829, he was a director of the\r\nnewly founded Jewish congregational school; for one year he occupied the\r\nposition of preacher at Prague; and from 1839 to 1849, the year of its\r\nfinal closing, he acted as trustee of the Jewish teachers' seminary in\r\nBerlin. Thereafter he had no official position.\r\n\r\nAs a politician he was a pronounced democrat. Reading his political\r\naddresses to-day, after a lapse of half a century, we find in them the\r\nclearness and sagacity that distinguish the scientific productions of\r\nthe investigator. Here is an extract from his words of consolation\r\naddressed to the families of the heroes of the March revolution of\r\n1848:[91]\r\n\r\n\"They who walked our streets unnoticed, who meditated in their quiet\r\nstudies, toiled in their workshops, cast up accounts in offices, sold\r\nwares in the shops, were suddenly transformed into valiant fighters, and\r\nwe discovered them at the moment when like meteors they vanished. When\r\nthey grew lustrous, they disappeared from our sight, and when they\r\nbecame our deliverers, we lost the opportunity of thanking them. Death\r\nhas made them great and precious to us. Departing they poured unmeasured\r\nwealth upon us all, who were so poor. Our heads, parched like a summer\r\nsky, produced no fruitful rain of magnanimous thoughts. The hearts in\r\nour bosoms, turned into stone, were bereft of human sympathies. Vanity\r\nand illusions were our idols; lies and deception poisoned our lives;\r\nlust and avarice dictated our actions; a hell of immorality and misery,\r\ncorroding every institution, heated the atmosphere to suffocation, until\r\nblack clouds gathered, a storm of the nations raged about us, and\r\npurifying streaks of lightning darted down upon the barricades and into\r\nthe streets. Through the storm-wind, I saw chariots of fire and horses\r\nof fire bearing to heaven the men of God who fell fighting for right and\r\nliberty. I hear the voice of God, O ye that weep, knighting your dear\r\nones. The freedom of the press is their patent of nobility, our hearts,\r\ntheir monuments. Every one of us, every German, is a mourner, and you,\r\nsurvivors, are no longer abandoned.\"\r\n\r\nIn an election address of February 1849,[92] Zunz says: \"The first step\r\ntowards liberty is to miss liberty, the second, to seek it, the third,\r\nto find it. Of course, many years may pass between the seeking and the\r\nfinding.\" And further on: \"As an elector, I should give my vote for\r\nrepresentatives only to men of principle and immaculate reputation, who\r\nneither hesitate nor yield; who cannot be made to say cold is warm, and\r\nwarm is cold; who disdain legal subtleties, diplomatic intrigues, lies\r\nof whatever kind, even when they redound to the advantage of the party.\r\nSuch are worthy of the confidence of the people, because conscience is\r\ntheir monitor. They may err, for to err is human, but they will never\r\ndeceive.\"\r\n\r\nTwelve years later, on a similar occasion, he uttered the following\r\nprophetic words:[93] \"A genuinely free form of government makes a people\r\nfree and upright, and its representatives are bound to be champions of\r\nliberty and progress. If Prussia, unfurling the banner of liberty and\r\nprogress, will undertake to provide us with such a constitution, our\r\nself-confidence, energy, and trustfulness will return. Progress will be\r\nthe fundamental principle of our lives, and out of our united efforts to\r\nadvance it will grow a firm, indissoluble union. Now, then, Germans! Be\r\nresolved, all of you, to attain the same goal, and your will shall be a\r\nstorm-wind scattering like chaff whatever is old and rotten. In your\r\nstruggle for a free country, you will have as allies the army of mighty\r\nminds that have suffered for right and liberty in the past. Now you are\r\nsplit up into tribes and clans, held together only by the bond of\r\nlanguage and a classic literature. You will grow into a great nation, if\r\nbut all brother-tribes will join us. Then Germany, strongly secure in\r\nthe heart of Europe, will be able to put an end to the quailing before\r\nattacks from the East or the West, and cry a halt to war. The empire,\r\nsome one has said, means peace. Verily, with Prussia at its head, the\r\nGerman empire means peace.\"\r\n\r\nSuch utterances are characteristic of Zunz, the politician. His best\r\nenergies and efforts, however, were devoted to his researches. Science,\r\nhe believed, would bring about amelioration of political conditions;\r\nscience, he hoped, would preserve Judaism from the storms and calamities\r\nof his generation, for the fulfilment of its historical mission.\r\nPossessed by this idea, he wrote _Die Gottesdienstlichen Vortraege der\r\nJuden_ (\"Jewish Homiletics,\" 1832), the basis of the future science of\r\nJudaism, the first clearing in the primeval forest of rabbinical\r\nwritings, through which the pioneer led his followers with steady step\r\nand hand, as though walking on well trodden ground. Heinrich Heine, who\r\nappreciated Zunz at his full worth, justly reckoned this book \"among the\r\nnoteworthy productions of the higher criticism,\" and another reviewer\r\nwith equal justice ranks it on a level with the great works of Boeckh,\r\nDiez, Grimm, and others of that period, the golden age of philological\r\nresearch in Germany.\r\n\r\nLike almost all that Zunz wrote, _Die Gottesdienstlichen Vortraege der\r\nJuden_ was the result of a polemic need. By nature Zunz was a\r\ncontroversialist. Like a sentinel upon the battlements, he kept a sharp\r\nlookout upon the land. Let the Jews be threatened with injustice by\r\nruler, statesman, or scholar, and straightway he attacked the enemy with\r\nthe weapons of satire and science. One can fancy that the cabinet order\r\nprohibiting German sermons in the synagogue, and so stifling the\r\nambition of his youth, awakened the resolve to trace the development of\r\nthe sermon among Jews, and show that thousands of years ago the\r\nwell-spring of religious instruction bubbled up in Judah's halls of\r\nprayer, and has never since failed, its wealth of waters overflowing\r\ninto the popular Midrash, the repository of little known, unappreciated\r\ntreasures of knowledge and experience, accumulated in the course of many\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nIn the preface to this book, Zunz, the democrat, says that for his\r\nbrethren in faith he demands of the European powers, \"not rights and\r\nliberties, but right and liberty. Deep shame should mantle the cheek of\r\nhim who, by means of a patent of nobility conferred by favoritism, is\r\nwilling to rise above his _co-religionists_, while the law of the land\r\nbrands him by assigning him a place among the lowest of his\r\n_co-citizens_. Only in the rights common to all citizens can we find\r\nsatisfaction; only in unquestioned equality, the end of our pain.\r\nLiberty unshackling the hand to fetter the tongue; tolerance delighting\r\nnot in our progress, but in our decay; citizenship promising protection\r\nwithout honor, imposing burdens without holding out prospects of\r\nadvancement; they all, in my opinion, are lacking in love and justice,\r\nand such baneful elements in the body politic must needs engender\r\npestiferous diseases, affecting the whole and its every part.\"\r\n\r\nZunz sees a connection between the civil disabilities of the Jews and\r\ntheir neglect of Jewish science and literature. Untrammelled,\r\ninstructive speech he accounts the surest weapon. Hence the homilies of\r\nthe Jews appear to him to be worthy, and to stand in need, of\r\nhistorical investigation, and the results of his research into their\r\norigin, development, and uses, from the time of Ezra to the present day,\r\nare laid down in this epoch-making work.\r\n\r\nThe law forbidding the bearing of German names by Jews provoked Zunz's\r\nfamous and influential little book, \"The Names of the Jews,\" like most\r\nof his later writings polemic in origin, in which respect they remind\r\none of Lessing's works.\r\n\r\nIn the ardor of youth Zunz had borne the banner of reform; in middle age\r\nhe became convinced that the young generation of iconoclasts had rushed\r\nfar beyond the ideal goal of the reform movement cherished in his\r\nvisions. As he had upheld the age and sacred uses of the German sermon\r\nagainst the assaults of the orthodox; so for the benefit and instruction\r\nof radical reformers, he expounded the value and importance of the\r\nHebrew liturgy in profound works, which appeared during a period of ten\r\nyears, crystallizing the results of a half-century's severe application.\r\nThey rounded off the symmetry of his spiritual activity. For, when\r\nMidrashic inspiration ceased to flow, the _piut_--synagogue\r\npoetry--established itself, and the transformation from the one into the\r\nother was the active principle of neo-Hebraic literature for more than a\r\nthousand years. Zunz's vivifying sympathies knit the old and the new\r\ninto a wondrously firm historical thread. Nowhere have the harmony and\r\ncontinuity of Jewish literary development found such adequate expression\r\nas in his _Synagogale Poesie des Mittelalters_ (\"Synagogue Poetry of\r\nthe Middle Ages,\" 1855), _Ritus des synagogalen Gottesdienstes_ (\"The\r\nRitual of the Synagogue,\" 1859), and _Litteraturgeschichte der\r\nsynagogalen Poesie_ (\"History of Synagogue Poetry,\" 1864), the capstone\r\nof his literary endeavors.\r\n\r\nIn his opinion, the only safeguard against error lies in the pursuit of\r\nscience, not, indeed, dryasdust science, but science in close touch with\r\nthe exuberance of life regulated by high-minded principles, and\r\ntransfigured by ideal hopes. Sermons and prayers in harmonious relation,\r\nhe believed,[94] will \"enable some future generation to enjoy the fruits\r\nof a progressive, rational policy, and it is meet that science and\r\npoetry should be permeated with ideas serving the furtherance of such\r\npolicy. Education is charged with the task of moulding enlightened minds\r\nto think the thoughts that prepare for right-doing, and warm,\r\nenthusiastic hearts to execute commendable deeds. For, after all is said\r\nand done, the well-being of the community can only grow out of the\r\nintelligence and the moral life of each member. Every individual that\r\nstrives to apprehend the harmony of human and divine elements attains to\r\nmembership in the divine covenant. The divine is the aim of all our\r\nthoughts, actions, sentiments, and hopes. It invests our lives with\r\ndignity, and supplies a moral basis for our relations to one another.\r\nWell, then, let us hope for redemption--for the universal recognition of\r\na form of government under which the rights of man are respected. Then\r\nfree citizens will welcome Jews as brethren, and Israel's prayers will\r\nbe offered up by mankind.\"\r\n\r\nThese are samples of the thoughts underlying Zunz's great works, as well\r\nas his numerous smaller, though not less important, productions:\r\nbiographical and critical essays, legal opinions, sketches in the\r\nhistory of literature, reviews, scientific inquiries, polemical and\r\nliterary fragments, collected in his work _Zur Geschichte und\r\nLitteratur_ (\"Contributions to History and Literature,\" 1873), and in\r\nthree volumes of collected writings. Since the publication of his\r\n\"History of Synagogue Poetry,\" Zunz wrote only on rare occasions. His\r\nlast work but one was _Deutsche Briefe_ (1872) on German language and\r\nGerman intellect, and his last, an incisive and liberal contribution to\r\nBible criticism (_Studie zur Bibelkritik_, 1874), published in the\r\n_Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenlaendischen Gesellschaft_ in Leipsic.\r\nFrom that time on, when the death of his beloved wife, Adelheid Zunz, a\r\nmost faithful helpmate, friend, counsellor, and support, occurred, he\r\nwas silent.\r\n\r\nZunz had passed his seventieth year when his \"History of Synagogue\r\nPoetry\" appeared. He could permit himself to indulge in well-earned\r\nrest, and from the vantage-ground of age inspect the bustling activity\r\nof a new generation of friends and disciples on the once neglected field\r\nof Jewish science.\r\n\r\nOften as the cause of religion and civil liberty received a check at\r\none place or another, during those long years when he stood aside from\r\nthe turmoil of life, a mere looker-on, he did not despair; he continued\r\nto hope undaunted. Under his picture he wrote sententiously: \"Thought is\r\nstrong enough to vanquish arrogance and injustice without recourse to\r\narrogance and injustice.\"\r\n\r\nZunz's life and work are of incalculable importance to the present age\r\nand to future generations. With eagle vision he surveyed the whole\r\ndomain of Jewish learning, and traced the lines of its development.\r\nConstructive as well as critical, he raised widely scattered fragments\r\nto the rank of a literature which may well claim a place beside the\r\nliteratures of the nations. Endowed with rare strength of character, he\r\nremained unflinchingly loyal to his ancestral faith, \"the exalted hobby\r\nof his soul\"--a model for three generations. Jewish literature owes to\r\nhim a scientific style. He wrote epigrammatic, incisive, perspicuous\r\nGerman, stimulating and suggestive, such as Lessing used. The reform\r\nmovement he supported as a legitimate development of Judaism on\r\nhistorical lines. On the other hand, he fostered loyalty to Judaism by\r\nlucidly presenting to young Israel the value of his faith, his\r\nintellectual heritage, and his treasures of poetry. Zunz, then, is the\r\noriginator of a momentous phase in our development, producing among its\r\nadherents as among outsiders a complete revolution in the appreciation\r\nof Judaism, its religious and intellectual aspects. Together with\r\nself-knowledge he taught his brethren self-respect. He was, in short, a\r\nclear thinker and acute critic; a German, deeply attached to his beloved\r\ncountry, and fully convinced of the supremacy of German mind; at the\r\nsame time, an ardent believer in Judaism, imbued with some of the spirit\r\nof the prophets, somewhat of the strength of Jewish heroes and martyrs,\r\nwho sacrificed life for their conviction, and with dying lips made the\r\nancient confession: \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord, our God, the Lord is\r\none!\"\r\n\r\nHis name is an abiding possession for our nation; it will not perish\r\nfrom our memory. \"Good night, my prince! O that angel choirs might lull\r\nthy slumbers!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEINRICH HEINE AND JUDAISM\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nNo modern poet has aroused so much discussion as Heinrich Heine. His\r\nworks are known everywhere, and quotations from them--gorgeous\r\nbutterflies, stinging gnats, buzzing bees--whizz and whirr through the\r\nair of our century. They are the _vade mecum_ of modern life in all its\r\nmoods and variations.\r\n\r\nThis high regard is a recent development. Within the last thirty years a\r\ncomplete change has taken place in public opinion. Soon after the poet's\r\ndeath, he was entirely neglected. The _Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung_,\r\nwhose columns had for decades been enriched with his contributions, took\r\nthree months to get up a little obituary notice. Then followed a period\r\nof acrimonious detraction; at last, cordial appreciation has come.\r\n\r\nThe conviction has been growing that in Heine the German nation must\r\nrevere its greatest lyric poet since Goethe, and as time removes him\r\nfrom us, the baser elements of his character recede into the background,\r\nhis personality is lost sight of, and his poetry becomes the paramount\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nWhat is the attitude of Judaism? Does it acknowledge Heine as its son?\r\nIs it disposed to accept _cum beneficio inventarii_ the inheritance he\r\nhas bequeathed to it? To answer these questions we must review Heine's\r\nlife, his relations to Judaism, his opinions on Jewish subjects, and the\r\nqualities which prove him heir to the peculiarities of the Jewish race.\r\n\r\nHeine's family was Jewish. On the paternal side it can be traced to\r\nMeyer Samson Popert and Fromet Heckscher of Altona; on the maternal side\r\nfurther back, to Isaac van Geldern, who emigrated in about 1700 from\r\nHolland to the duchy of Juelich-Berg. He and his son Lazarus van Geldern\r\nwere people of importance at Duesseldorf, and his other sons, Simon and\r\nGottschalk, were known and respected beyond the confines of their city.\r\nSimon van Geldern was the author of \"The Israelites on Mount Horeb,\" a\r\ndidactic poem in English, and on his trip to the East he kept a Hebrew\r\njournal, which can still be seen. His younger brother Gottschalk was a\r\ndistinguished physician, and occupied a position of high dignity in the\r\nJewish congregations in the duchies of Juelich and Berg. It is said that\r\nhe provided for the welfare of his brethren in faith \"as a father\r\nprovides for his children.\" His only daughter Betty (Peierche) van\r\nGeldern, urged by her family and in obedience to the promptings of her\r\nown heart, married Samson Heine, and became the mother of the poet.\r\nHeine himself has written much about his family,[95] particularly about\r\nhis mother's brother. Of his paternal grandfather, he knew only what\r\nhis father had told him, that he was \"a little Jew with a great beard.\"\r\nOn the whole, his education was strictly religious, but it was tainted\r\nwith the deplorable inconsistency so frequently found in Jewish homes.\r\nThemselves heedless of religious ceremonies, parents exact from their\r\nchildren punctilious observance of minute regulations. Samson Heine was\r\none of the Jews often met with in the beginning of this century who,\r\nlacking true culture, caught up some of the encyclopaedist phrases with\r\nwhich the atmosphere of the period was heavy. Heine describes his\r\nfather's extraordinary buoyancy: \"Always azure serenity and fanfares of\r\ngood humor.\" The reproach is characteristic which he addressed to his\r\nson, when the latter was charged with atheism: \"Dear son! Your mother is\r\nhaving you instructed in philosophy by Rector Schallmeier--that is her\r\naffair. As for me, I have no love for philosophy; it is nothing but\r\nsuperstition. I am a merchant, and need all my faculties for my\r\nbusiness. You may philosophize as much as you please, only, I beg of\r\nyou, don't tell any one what you think. It would harm my business, were\r\npeople to discover that my son does not believe in God. Particularly the\r\nJews would stop buying velvets from me, and they are honest folk, and\r\npay promptly. And they are right in clinging to religion. Being your\r\nfather, therefore older than you, I am more experienced, and you may\r\ntake my word for it, atheism is a great sin.\"\r\n\r\nTwo instances related by Joseph Neunzig, one of his playmates, show how\r\nrigorously Harry was compelled to observe religious forms in his\r\npaternal home. On a Saturday the children were out walking, when\r\nsuddenly a fire broke out. The fire extinguishers came clattering up to\r\nthe burning house, but as the flames were spreading rapidly, all\r\nbystanders were ordered to range themselves in line with the firemen.\r\nHarry refused point-blank to help: \"I may not do it, and I will not,\r\nbecause it is _Shabbes_ to-day.\" But another time, when it jumped with\r\nhis wishes, the eight year old boy managed to circumvent the Law. He was\r\nplaying with some of his schoolmates in front of a neighbor's house. Two\r\nluscious bunches of grapes hung over the arbor almost down to the\r\nground. The children noticed them, and with longing in their eyes passed\r\non. Only Harry stood still before the grapes. Suddenly springing on the\r\narbor, he bit one grape after another from the bunch. \"Red-head Harry!\"\r\nthe children exclaimed horrified, \"what are you doing?\" \"Nothing wrong,\"\r\nsaid the little rogue. \"We are forbidden to pluck them with our hands,\r\nbut the law does not say anything about biting and eating.\" His\r\neducation was not equable and not methodical. Extremely indulgent\r\ntowards themselves, the parents were extremely severe in their treatment\r\nof their children. So arose the contradictions in the poet's character.\r\nHe is one of those to whom childhood's religion is a bitter-sweet\r\nremembrance unto the end of days. Jewish sympathies were his\r\ninalienable heritage, and from this point of view his life must be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nThe poet's mother was of a different stamp from his father. Like most of\r\nthe Jews in the Rhenish provinces, his father hailed Napoleon, the first\r\nlegislator to establish equality between Jews and Christians, as a\r\nsavior. His mother, on the other hand, was a good German patriot and a\r\nwoman of culture, who exercised no inconsiderable influence upon the\r\nheart and mind of her son. Heine calls her a disciple of Rousseau, and\r\nhis brother Maximilian tells us that Goethe was her favorite among\r\nauthors.\r\n\r\nThe boy was first taught by Rintelsohn at a Jewish school, but his\r\nknowledge of Hebrew seems to have been very limited. It is an\r\ninteresting fact that his first poem, \"Belshazzar,\" which he tells us he\r\nwrote at the age of sixteen, was inspired by his childhood's faith and\r\nis based upon Jewish history. Towards the end of his life he said to a\r\nfriend:[96] \"Do you know what inspired me? A few words in the Hebrew\r\nhymn, _Wayhee bechatsi halaila_, sung, as you know, on the first two\r\nevenings of the Passover. This hymn commemorates all momentous events in\r\nthe history of the Jews that occurred at midnight; among them the death\r\nof the Babylonian tyrant, snatched away at night for desecrating the\r\nholy Temple vessels. The quoted words are the refrain of the hymn, which\r\nforms part of the Haggada, the curious medley of legends and songs,\r\nrecited by pious Jews at the _Seder_.\" Ay, the Passover celebration,\r\nthe _Seder_, remained in the poet's memory till the day of his death. He\r\ndescribes it still later in one of his finest works:[97] \"Sweetly sad,\r\njoyous, earnest, sportive, and elfishly mysterious is that evening\r\nservice, and the traditional chant with which the Haggada is recited by\r\nthe head of the family, the listeners sometimes joining in as a chorus,\r\nis thrillingly tender, soothing as a mother's lullaby, yet impetuous and\r\ninspiring, so that Jews who long have drifted from the faith of their\r\nfathers, and have been pursuing the joys and dignities of the stranger,\r\neven they are stirred in their inmost parts when the old, familiar\r\nPassover sounds chance to fall upon their ears.\"\r\n\r\nMy esteemed friend Rabbi Dr. Frank of Cologne has in his possession a\r\nHaggada, admirably illustrated, an heirloom at one time of the Van\r\nGeldern family, and it is not improbable that it was out of this\r\nartistic book that Heinrich Heine asked the _Mah nishtannah_, the\r\ntraditional question of the _Seder_.\r\n\r\nHeine left home very young, and everybody knows that he was apprenticed\r\nto a merchant at Frankfort, and that his uncle Solomon's kindness\r\nenabled him to devote himself to jurisprudence. But this, of important\r\nbearing on our subject, is not a matter of common knowledge: _Always and\r\neverywhere, especially when he had least intercourse with Jews, Jewish\r\nelements appear most prominently in Heine's life._\r\n\r\nA merry, light-hearted student, he arrived in Berlin in 1821. A curious\r\nspectacle is presented by the Jewish Berlin of the day, dominated by the\r\n_salons_, and the women whose tact and scintillating wit made them the\r\nvery centre of general society. The traditions of Rahel Levin, Henriette\r\nHerz, and other clever women, still held sway. But the state frustrated\r\nevery attempt to introduce reforms into Judaism. Two great parties\r\nopposed each other more implacably than ever, the one clutching the old,\r\nthe other yearning for the new. Out of the breach, salvation was in time\r\nto sprout. In the first quarter of our century, more than three-fourths\r\nof the Jewish population of Berlin embraced the ruling faith. This was\r\nthe new, seditious element with which young Heine was thrown. His\r\ninteresting personality attracted general notice. All circles welcomed\r\nhim. The _salons_ did their utmost to make him one of their votaries.\r\nRomantic student clubs at Lutter's and Wegener's wine-rooms left nothing\r\nuntried to lure him to their nocturnal carousals. Even Hegel, the\r\nphilosopher, evinced marked interest in him. To whose allurements does\r\nhe yield? Like his great ancestor, he goes to \"his brethren languishing\r\nin captivity.\" Some of his young friends, Edward Gans, Leopold Zunz, and\r\nMoses Moser, had formed a \"Society for Jewish Culture and Science,\" with\r\nBerlin as its centre, and Heinrich Heine became one of its most active\r\nmembers. He taught poor Jewish boys from Posen several hours a week in\r\nthe school established by the society, and all questions that came up\r\ninterested him. Joseph Lehmann took pleasure in repeatedly telling how\r\nseriously Heine applied himself to a review which he had undertaken to\r\nwrite on the compilation of a German prayer-book for Jewish women.\r\n\r\nTo the Berlin period belongs his _Almansor_, a dramatic poem which has\r\nsuffered the most contradictory criticism. In my opinion, it has usually\r\nbeen misunderstood. _Almansor_ is intelligible only if regarded from a\r\nJewish point of view, and then it is seen to be the hymn of vengeance\r\nsung by Judaism oppressed. Substitute the names of a converted Berlin\r\nbanker and his wife for \"Aly\" and \"Suleima,\" Berlin under Frederick\r\nWilliam III. for \"Saragossa,\" the Berlin Thiergarten for the \"Forest,\"\r\nand the satire stands revealed. The following passage is characteristic\r\nof the whole poem:[98]\r\n\r\n    \"Go not to Aly's castle! Flee\r\n    That noxious house where new faith breeds.\r\n    With honeyed accents there thy heart\r\n    Is wrenched from out thy bosom's depths,\r\n    A snake bestowed on thee instead.\r\n    Hot drops of lead on thy poor head\r\n    Are poured, and nevermore thy brain\r\n    From madding pain shall rid itself.\r\n    Another name thou must assume,\r\n    That if thy angel warning calls,\r\n    And calls thee by thy olden name,\r\n    He call in vain.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were Heine's views at that time, and with them he went to\r\nGoettingen. There, though Jewish society was entirely lacking, and\r\ncorrespondence with his Berlin friends desultory, his Jewish interests\r\ngrew stronger than ever. There, inspired by the genius of Jewish\r\nhistory, he composed his _Rabbi von Bacharach_, the work which, by his\r\nown confession, he nursed with unspeakable love, and which, he fondly\r\nhoped, would \"become an immortal book, a perpetual lamp in the dome of\r\nGod.\" Again Jewish conversions, a burning question of the day, were made\r\nprominent. Heine's solution is beyond a cavil enlightened. The words are\r\ntruly remarkable with which Sarah, the beautiful Jewess, declines the\r\nservices of the gallant knight:[99] \"Noble sir! Would you be my knight,\r\nthen you must meet nations in a combat in which small praise and less\r\nhonor are to be won. And would you be rash enough to wear my colors,\r\nthen you must sew yellow wheels upon your mantle, or bind a blue-striped\r\nscarf about your breast. For these are my colors, the colors of my\r\nhouse, named Israel, the unhappy house mocked at on the highways and the\r\nbyways by the children of fortune.\"\r\n\r\nAnother illustration of Heine's views at that time of his life, and with\r\nthose views he one day went to the neighboring town of Heiligenstadt--to\r\nbe baptized.\r\n\r\nWho can sound the depths of a poet's soul? Who can divine what Heine's\r\nthoughts, what his hopes were, when he took this step? His letters and\r\nconfessions of that period must be read to gain an idea of his inner\r\nworld. On one occasion he wrote to Moser, to whom he laid bare his most\r\nintimate thoughts:[100] \"Mentioning Japan reminds me to recommend to you\r\nGolovnin's 'Journey to Japan.' Perhaps I may send you a poem to-day from\r\nthe _Rabbi_, in the writing of which I unfortunately have been\r\ninterrupted again. I beg that you speak to nobody about this poem, or\r\nabout what I tell you of my private affairs. A young Spaniard, at heart\r\na Jew, is beguiled to baptism by the arrogance bred of luxury. He sends\r\nthe translation of an Arabic poem to young Yehuda Abarbanel, with whom\r\nhe is corresponding. Perhaps he shrinks from directly confessing to his\r\nfriend an action hardly to be called admirable.... Pray do not think\r\nabout this.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the poem? It is this:\r\n\r\n    TO EDOM\r\n\r\n    \"Each with each has borne, in patience\r\n      Longer than a thousand year--\r\n    _Thou_ dost tolerate my breathing,\r\n      _I_ thy ravings calmly hear.\r\n\r\n    Sometimes only, in the darkness,\r\n      Thou didst have sensations odd,\r\n    And thy paws, caressing, gentle,\r\n      Crimson turned with my rich blood.\r\n\r\n    Now our friendship firmer groweth,\r\n      Daily keeps on growing straight.\r\n    I myself incline to madness,\r\n      Soon, in faith, I'll be thy mate.\"\r\n\r\nA few weeks later he writes to Moser in a still more bitter strain: \"I\r\nknow not what to say. Cohen assures me that Gans is preaching\r\nChristianity, and trying to convert the children of Israel. If this is\r\nconviction, he is a fool; if hypocrisy, a knave. I shall not give up\r\nloving him, but I confess that I should have been better pleased to hear\r\nthat Gans had been stealing silver spoons. That you, dear Moser, share\r\nGans's opinions, I cannot believe, though Cohen assures me of it, and\r\nsays that you told him so yourself. I should be sorry, if my own baptism\r\nwere to strike you more favorably. I give you my word of honor--if our\r\nlaws allowed stealing silver spoons, I should not have been baptized.\"\r\nAgain he writes mournfully: \"As, according to Solon, no man may be\r\ncalled happy, so none should be called honest, before his death. I am\r\nglad that David Friedlaender and Bendavid are old, and will soon die.\r\nThen we shall be certain of them, and the reproach of having had not a\r\nsingle immaculate representative cannot be attached to our time. Pardon\r\nmy ill humor. It is directed mainly against myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon how true a basis the myth of the wandering Jew rests!\" he says in\r\nanother letter. \"In the lonely wooded valley, the mother tells her\r\nchildren the grewsome tale. Terror-stricken the little ones cower close\r\nto the hearth. It is night ... the postilion blows his horn ... Jew\r\ntraders are journeying to the fair at Leipsic. We, the heroes of the\r\nlegend, are not aware of our part in it. The white beard, whose tips\r\ntime has rejuvenated, no barber can remove.\" In those days he wrote the\r\nfollowing poem, published posthumously:[101]\r\n\r\n    TO AN APOSTATE\r\n\r\n    \"Out upon youth's holy flame!\r\n      Oh! how quickly it burns low!\r\n    Now, thy heated blood grown tame,\r\n      Thou agreest to love thy foe!\r\n\r\n    And thou meekly grovell'st low\r\n      At the cross which thou didst spurn;\r\n    Which not many weeks ago,\r\n      Thou didst wish to crush and burn.\r\n\r\n    Fie! that comes from books untold--\r\n      There are Schlegel, Haller, Burke--\r\n    Yesterday a hero bold,\r\n      Thou to-day dost scoundrel's work.\"\r\n\r\nThe usual explanation of Heine's formal adoption of Christianity is that\r\nhe wished to obtain a government position in Prussia, and make himself\r\nindependent of his rich uncle. As no other offers itself, we are forced\r\nto accept it as correct. He was fated to recognize speedily that he had\r\ngained nothing by baptism. A few weeks after settling in Hamburg he\r\nwrote: \"I repent me of having been baptized. I cannot see that I have\r\nbettered my position. On the contrary, I have had nothing but\r\ndisappointment and bad luck.\" Despite his baptism, his enemies called\r\nhim \"the Jew,\" and at heart he never did become a Christian.\r\n\r\nAt Hamburg, in those days, Heine was repeatedly drawn into the conflict\r\nbetween reform and orthodoxy, between the Temple and the synagogue. His\r\nuncle Solomon Heine was a warm supporter of the Temple, but Heine, with\r\ncharacteristic inconsistency, admired the old rigorous rabbinical system\r\nmore than the modern reform movement, which often called forth his\r\nridicule. Yet, at bottom, his interest in the latter was strong, as it\r\ncontinued to be also in the Berlin educational society, and its \"Journal\r\nfor the Science of Judaism,\" of which, however, only three numbers were\r\nissued. He once wrote from Hamburg to his friend Moser: \"Last Saturday I\r\nwas at the Temple, and had the pleasure with my own ears to hear Dr.\r\nSalomon rail against baptized Jews, and insinuate that they are tempted\r\nto become faithless to the religion of their fathers only by the hope of\r\npreferment. I assure you, the sermon was good, and some day I intend to\r\ncall upon the man. Cohen is doing the generous thing by me. I take my\r\n_Shabbes_ dinner with him; he heaps fiery _Kugel_ upon my head, and\r\ncontritely I eat the sacred national dish, which has done more for the\r\npreservation of Judaism than all three numbers of the Journal. To be\r\nsure, it has had a better sale. If I had time, I would write a pretty\r\nlittle Jewish letter to Mrs. Zunz. I am getting to be a thoroughbred\r\nChristian; I am sponging on the rich Jews.\"\r\n\r\nThey who find nothing but jest in this letter, do not understand Heine.\r\nA bitter strain of disgust, of unsparing self-denunciation, runs through\r\nit--the feelings that dictate the jests and accusations of his\r\n_Reisebilder_. This was the period of Heine's best creations: for as\r\nsuch his \"Book of Songs,\" _Buch der Lieder_, and his _Reisebilder_ must\r\nbe considered. With a sudden bound he leapt into greatness and\r\npopularity.\r\n\r\nThe reader may ask me to point out in these works the features to be\r\ntaken as the expression of the genius of the Jewish race. To understand\r\nour poet, we must keep in mind that _Heinrich Heine was a Jew born in\r\nthe days of romanticism in a town on the Rhine_. His intellect and his\r\nsensuousness, of Jewish origin, were wedded with Rhenish fancy and\r\nblitheness, and over these qualities the pale moonshine of romanticism\r\nshed its glamour.\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy characteristic of his writings, prose and verse, is\r\nhis extraordinary subjectivity, pushing the poet's _ego_ into the\r\nforeground. With light, graceful touch, he demonstrates the possibility\r\nof unrestrained self-expression in an artistic guise. The boldness and\r\nenergy with which \"he gave voice to his hidden self\" were so novel, so\r\nsurprising, that his melodies at once awoke an echo. This subjectivity\r\nis his Jewish birthright. It is Israel's ingrained combativeness, for\r\nmore than a thousand years the genius of its literature, which\r\nthroughout reveals a predilection for abrupt contrasts, and is studded\r\nwith unmistakable expressions of strong individuality. By virtue of his\r\nsubjectivity, which never permits him to surrender himself\r\nunconditionally, the Jew establishes a connection between his _ego_ and\r\nwhatever subject he treats of. \"He does not sink his own identity, and\r\nlose himself in the depths of the cosmos, nor roam hither and thither in\r\nthe limitless space of the world of thought. He dives down to search for\r\npearls at the bottom of the sea, or rises aloft to gain a bird's-eye\r\nview of the whole. The world encloses him as the works of a clock are\r\nheld in a case. His _ego_ is the hammer, and there is no sound unless,\r\nswinging rhythmically, itself touches the sides, now softly, now\r\nboldly.\" Not content to yield to an authority which would suppress his\r\nfreedom of action, he traverses the world, and compels it to promote the\r\ndevelopment of his energetic nature. To these peculiarities of his race\r\nHeine fell heir--to the generous traits growing out of marked\r\nindividuality, its grooves deepened by a thousand years of martyrdom, as\r\nwell as to the petty faults following in the wake of excessive\r\nself-consciousness; which have furnished adversaries of the Jews with\r\ntexts and weapons.\r\n\r\nThis subjectivity, traceable in his language and in his ancient\r\nliterature, it is that unfits the Jew for objective, philosophic\r\ninvestigation. It is, moreover, responsible for that energetic\r\nself-assertiveness for which the Aramaean language has coined the word\r\n_chutspa_, only partially rendered by arrogance. Possibly it is the root\r\nof another quality which Heine owes to his Jewish extraction--his wit\r\nHeine's scintillations are composed of a number of elements--of English\r\nhumor, French sparkle, German irony, and Jewish wit, all of which,\r\nsaving the last, have been analyzed by the critics. Proneness to\r\ncensure, to criticism, and discussion, is the concomitant of keen\r\nintellect given to scrutiny and analysis. From the buoyancy of the\r\nJewish disposition, and out of the force of Jewish subjectivity, arose\r\nJewish wit, whose first manifestations can be traced in the Talmud and\r\nthe Midrash. Its appeals are directed to both fancy and heart. It\r\ndelights in antithesis, and, as was said above, is intimately connected\r\nwith Jewish subjectivity. Its distinguishing characteristic is the\r\ndesire to have its superiority acknowledged without wounding the\r\nfeelings of the sensitive, and an explanation of its peculiarity can be\r\nfound in the sad fate of the Jews. The heroes of Shakespere's tragedies\r\nare full of irony. Frenzy at its maddest pitch breaks out into merry\r\nwitticisms and scornful laughter. So it was with the Jews. The waves of\r\noppression, forever dashing over them, strung their nerves to the point\r\nof reaction. The world was closed to them in hostility. There was\r\nnothing for them to do but laugh--laugh with forced merriment from\r\nbehind prison bars, and out of the depths of their heartrending\r\nresignation. Complaints it was possible to suppress, but no one could\r\nforbid their laughter, ghastly though it was. M. G. Saphir, one of the\r\nbest exponents of Jewish wit, justly said: \"The Jews seized the weapon\r\nof wit, since they were interdicted the use of every other sort of\r\nweapon.\" Whatever humdrum life during the middle ages offered them, had\r\nto submit to the scalpel of their wit.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, Jewish wit springs from a lively appreciation of what is\r\ningenious. A serious beginning suddenly and unexpectedly takes a merry,\r\njocose turn, producing in Heine's elegiac passages the discordant\r\nendings so shocking to sensitive natures. But it is an injustice to the\r\npoet to attribute these rapid transitions to an artist's vain fancy. His\r\nsatire is directed against the ideals of his generation, not against the\r\nideal. Harsh, discordant notes do not express the poet's real\r\ndisposition. They are exaggerated, romantic feeling, for which he\r\nhimself, led by an instinctively pure conception of the good and the\r\nbeautiful, which is opposed alike to sickly sentimentality and jarring\r\ndissonance, sought the outlet of irony.\r\n\r\nHeine's humor, as I intimated above, springs from his recognition of the\r\ntragedy of life. It is an expression of the irreconcilable difference\r\nbetween the real and the ideal, of the perception that the world,\r\ndespite its grandeur and its beauty, is a world of folly and\r\ncontradictions; that whatever exists and is formed, bears within itself\r\nthe germ of death and corruption; that the Lord of all creation himself\r\nis but the shuttlecock of irresistible, absolute force, compelling the\r\nunconditional surrender of subject and object.\r\n\r\nHumor, then, grows out of the contemplation of the tragedy of life. But\r\nit does not stop there. If the world is so pitiful, so fragile, it is\r\nnot worth a tear, not worth hatred, or contempt. The only sensible\r\ncourse is to accept it as it is, as a nothing, an absolute\r\ncontradiction, calling forth ridicule. At this point, a sense of tragedy\r\nis transformed into demoniac glee. No more is this a permanent state.\r\nThe humorist is too impulsive to accept it as final. Moreover, he feels\r\nthat with the world he has annihilated himself. In the phantom realm\r\ninto which he has turned the world, his laughter reverberates with\r\nghostlike hollowness. Recognizing that the world meant more to him than\r\nhe was willing to admit, and that apart from it he has no being, he\r\nagain yields to it, and embraces it with increased passion and ardor.\r\nBut scarcely has the return been effected, scarcely has he begun to\r\nrealize the beauties and perfections of the world, when sadness,\r\nsuffering, pain, and torture, obtrude themselves, and the old\r\noverwhelming sense of life's tragedy takes possession of him. This train\r\nof thought, plainly discernible in Heine's poems, he also owes to his\r\ndescent. A mind given to such speculations naturally seeks poetic solace\r\nin _Weltschmerz_, which, as everybody knows, is still another heirloom\r\nof his race.\r\n\r\nThese are the most important characteristics, some admirable, some\r\nreprehensible, which Heine has derived from his race, and they are the\r\nvery ones that raised opponents against him, one of the most interesting\r\nand prominent among them being the German philosopher Arthur\r\nSchopenhauer. His two opinions on Heine, expressed at almost the same\r\ntime, are typical of the antagonism aroused by the poet. In his book,\r\n\"The World as Will and Idea,\"[102] he writes: \"Heine is a true humorist\r\nin his _Romanzero_. Back of all his quips and gibes lies deep\r\nseriousness, _ashamed_ to speak out frankly.\" At the same time he says\r\nin his journal, published posthumously: \"Although a buffoon, Heine has\r\ngenius, and the distinguishing mark of genius, ingenuousness. On close\r\nexamination, however, his ingenuousness turns out to have its root in\r\nJewish shamelessness; for he, too, belongs to the nation of which Riemer\r\nsays that it knows neither shame nor grief.\"\r\n\r\nThe contradiction between the two judgments is too obvious to need\r\nexplanation; it is an interesting illustration of the common experience\r\nthat critics go astray when dealing with Heine.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWhen, as Heine puts it, \"a great hand solicitously beckoned,\" he left\r\nhis German fatherland in his prime, and went to Paris. In its sociable\r\natmosphere, he felt more comfortable, more free, than in his own home,\r\nwhere the Jew, the author, the liberal, had encountered only prejudices.\r\nThe removal to Paris was an inauspicious change for the poet, and that\r\nhe remained there until his end was still less calculated to redound to\r\nhis good fortune. He gave much to France, and Paris did little during\r\nhis life to pay off the debt. The charm exercised upon every stranger by\r\nBabylon on the Seine, wrought havoc in his character and his work, and\r\ngives us the sole criterion for the rest of his days. Yet, despite his\r\ndevotion to Paris, home-sickness, yearning for Germany, was henceforth\r\nthe dominant note of his works. At that time Heine considered Judaism \"a\r\nlong lost cause.\" Of the God of Judaism, the philosophical\r\ndemonstrations of Hegel and his disciples had robbed him; his knowledge\r\nof doctrinal Judaism was a minimum; and his keen race-feeling, his\r\nhistorical instinct, was forced into the background by other sympathies\r\nand antipathies. He was at that time harping upon the long cherished\r\nidea that men can be divided into _Hellenists_ and _Nazarenes_. Himself,\r\nfor instance, he looked upon as a well-fed Hellenist, while Boerne was a\r\nNazarene, an ascetic. It is interesting, and bears upon our subject,\r\nthat most of the verdicts, views, and witticisms which Heine fathers\r\nupon Boerne in the famous imaginary conversation in the Frankfort\r\n_Judengasse_, might have been uttered by Heine himself. In fact, many of\r\nthem are repeated, partly in the same or in similar words, in the\r\njottings found after his death.\r\n\r\nThis conversation is represented as having taken place during the Feast\r\nof _Chanukka_. Heine who, as said above, took pleasure at that time in\r\nimpersonating a Hellenist, gets Boerne to explain to him that this feast\r\nwas instituted to commemorate the victory of the valiant Maccabees over\r\nthe king of Syria. After expatiating on the heroism of the Maccabees,\r\nand the cowardice of modern Jews, Boerne says:[103]\r\n\r\n\"Baptism is the order of the day among the wealthy Jews. The evangel\r\nvainly announced to the poor of Judaea now flourishes among the rich. Its\r\nacceptance is self-deception, if not a lie, and as hypocritical\r\nChristianity contrasts sharply with the old Adam, who will crop out,\r\nthese people lay themselves open to unsparing ridicule.--In the streets\r\nof Berlin I saw former daughters of Israel wear crosses about their\r\nnecks longer than their noses, reaching to their very waists. They\r\ncarried evangelical prayer books, and were discussing the magnificent\r\nsermon just heard at Trinity church. One asked the other where she had\r\ngone to communion, and all the while their breath smelt. Still more\r\ndisgusting was the sight of dirty, bearded, malodorous Polish Jews,\r\nhailing from Polish sewers, saved for heaven by the Berlin Society for\r\nthe Conversion of Jews, and in turn preaching Christianity in their\r\nslovenly jargon. Such Polish vermin should certainly be baptized with\r\ncologne instead of ordinary water.\"\r\n\r\nThis is to be taken as an expression of Heine's own feelings, which come\r\nout plainly, when, \"persistently loyal to Jewish customs,\" he eats,\r\n\"with good appetite, yes, with enthusiasm, with devotion, with\r\nconviction,\" _Shalet_, the famous Jewish dish, about which he says:\r\n\"This dish is delicious, and it is a subject for painful regret that\r\nthe Church, indebted to Judaism for so much that is good, has failed to\r\nintroduce _Shalet_. This should be her object in the future. If ever she\r\nfalls on evil times, if ever her most sacred symbols lose their virtue,\r\nthen the Church will resort to _Shalet_, and the faithless peoples will\r\ncrowd into her arms with renewed appetite. At all events the Jews will\r\nthen join the Church from conviction, for it is clear that it is only\r\n_Shalet_ that keeps them in the old covenant. Boerne assures me that\r\nrenegades who have accepted the new dispensation feel a sort of\r\nhome-sickness for the synagogue when they but smell _Shalet_, so that\r\n_Shalet_ may be called the Jewish _ranz des vaches_.\"\r\n\r\nHeine forgot that in another place he had uttered this witticism in his\r\nown name. He long continued to take peculiar pleasure in his dogmatic\r\ndivision of humanity into two classes, the lean and the fat, or rather,\r\nthe class that continually gets thinner, and the class which, beginning\r\nwith modest dimensions, gradually attains to corpulency. Only too soon\r\nthe poet was made to understand the radical falseness of his definition.\r\nA cold February morning of 1848 brought him a realizing sense of his\r\nfatal mistake. Sick and weary, the poet was taking his last walk on the\r\nboulevards, while the mob of the revolution surged in the streets of\r\nParis. Half blind, half paralyzed, leaning heavily on his cane, he\r\nsought to extricate himself from the clamorous crowd, and finally found\r\nrefuge in the Louvre, almost empty during the days of excitement. With\r\ndifficulty he dragged himself to the hall of the gods and goddesses of\r\nantiquity, and suddenly came face to face with the ideal of beauty, the\r\nsmiling, witching Venus of Milo, whose charms have defied time and\r\nmutilation. Surprised, moved, almost terrified, he reeled to a chair,\r\ntears, hot and bitter, coursing down his cheeks. A smile was hovering on\r\nthe beautiful lips of the goddess, parted as if by living breath, and at\r\nher feet a luckless victim was writhing. A single moment revealed a\r\nworld of misery. Driven by a consciousness of his fate, Heine wrote in\r\nhis \"Confessions\": \"In May of last year I was forced to take to my bed,\r\nand since then I have not risen. I confess frankly that meanwhile a\r\ngreat change has taken place in me. I no longer am a fat Hellenist, the\r\nfreest man since Goethe, a jolly, somewhat corpulent Hellenist, with a\r\ncontemptuous smile for lean Jews--I am only a poor Jew, sick unto death,\r\na picture of gaunt misery, an unhappy being.\"\r\n\r\nThis startling change was coincident with the first symptoms of his\r\ndisease, and kept pace with it. The pent-up forces of faith pressed to\r\nhis bedside; religious conversations, readings from the Bible,\r\nreminiscences of his youth, of his Jewish friends, filled his time\r\nalmost entirely. Alfred Meissner has culled many interesting data from\r\nhis conversations with the poet. For instance, on one occasion Heine\r\nbreaks out with:[104]\r\n\r\n\"Queer people this! Downtrodden for thousands of years, weeping always,\r\nsuffering always, abandoned always by its God, yet clinging to Him\r\ntenaciously, loyally, as no other under the sun. Oh, if martyrdom,\r\npatience, and faith in despite of trial, can confer a patent of\r\nnobility, then this people is noble beyond many another.--It would have\r\nbeen absurd and petty, if, as people accuse me, I had been ashamed of\r\nbeing a Jew. Yet it were equally ludicrous for me to call myself a\r\nJew.--As I instinctively hold up to unending scorn whatever is evil,\r\ntimeworn, absurd, false, and ludicrous, so my nature leads me to\r\nappreciate the sublime, to admire what is great, and to extol every\r\nliving force.\" Heine had spoken so much with deep earnestness. Jestingly\r\nhe added: \"Dear friend, if little Weill should visit us, you shall have\r\nanother evidence of my reverence for hoary Mosaism. Weill formerly was\r\nprecentor at the synagogue. He has a ringing tenor, and chants Judah's\r\ndesert songs according to the old traditions, ranging from the simple\r\nmonotone to the exuberance of Old Testament cadences. My wife, who has\r\nnot the slightest suspicion that I am a Jew, is not a little astonished\r\nby this peculiar musical wail, this trilling and cadencing. When Weill\r\nsang for the first time, Minka, the poodle, crawled into hiding under\r\nthe sofa, and Cocotte, the polly, made an attempt to throttle himself\r\nbetween the bars of his cage. 'M. Weill, M. Weill!' Mathilde cried\r\nterror-stricken, 'pray do not carry the joke too far.' But Weill\r\ncontinued, and the dear girl turned to me, and asked imploringly:\r\n'Henri, pray tell me what sort of songs these are.' 'They are our\r\nGerman folk songs,' said I, and I have obstinately stuck to that\r\nexplanation.\"\r\n\r\nMeissner reports an amusing conversation with Madame Mathilde about the\r\nfriends of the family, whom the former by their peculiarities recognized\r\nas Jews. \"What!\" cried Mathilde, \"Jews? They are Jews?\" \"Of course,\r\nAlexander Weill is a Jew, he told me so himself;--why he was going to be\r\na rabbi.\" \"But the rest, all the rest? For instance, there is Abeles,\r\nthe name sounds so thoroughly German.\" \"Rather say it sounds Greek,\"\r\nanswered Meissner. \"Yet I venture to insist that our friend Abeles has\r\nas little German as Greek blood in his veins.\" \"Very well! But\r\nJeiteles--Kalisch--Bamberg--Are they, too.... O no, you are mistaken,\r\nnot one is a Jew,\" cried Mathilde. \"You will never make me believe that.\r\nPresently you will make out Cohn to be a Jew. But Cohn is related to\r\nHeine, and Heine is a Protestant.\" So Meissner found out that Heine had\r\nnever told his wife anything about his descent. He gravely answered:\r\n\"You are right. With regard to Cohn I was of course mistaken. Cohn is\r\ncertainly not a Jew.\"\r\n\r\nThese are mere jests. In point of fact, his friends' reports on the\r\nreligious attitude of the Heine of that period are of the utmost\r\ninterest. He once said to Ludwig Kalisch, who had told him that the\r\nworld was all agog over his conversion:[105] \"I do not make a secret of\r\nmy Jewish allegiance, to which I have not returned, because I never\r\nabjured it. I was not baptized from aversion to Judaism, and my\r\nprofessions of atheism were never serious. My former friends, the\r\nHegelians, have turned out scamps. Human misery is too great for men to\r\ndo without faith.\"\r\n\r\nThe completest picture of the transformation, truer than any given in\r\nletters, reports, or reminiscences, is in his last two productions, the\r\n_Romanzero_ and the \"Confessions.\" There can be no more explicit\r\ndescription of the poet's conversion than is contained in these\r\n\"confessions.\" During his sickness he sought a palliative for his\r\npains--in the Bible. With a melancholy smile his mind reverted to the\r\nmemories of his youth, to the heroism which is the underlying principle\r\nof Judaism. The Psalmist's consolations, the elevating principles laid\r\ndown in the Pentateuch, exerted a powerful attraction upon him, and\r\nfilled his soul with exalted thoughts, shaped into words in the\r\n\"Confessions\":[106] \"Formerly I felt little affection for Moses,\r\nprobably because the Hellenic spirit was dominant within me, and I could\r\nnot pardon the Jewish lawgiver for his intolerance of images, and every\r\nsort of plastic representation. I failed to see that despite his hostile\r\nattitude to art, Moses was himself a great artist, gifted with the true\r\nartist's spirit. Only in him, as in his Egyptian neighbors, the artistic\r\ninstinct was exercised solely upon the colossal and the indestructible.\r\nBut unlike the Egyptians he did not shape his works of art out of brick\r\nor granite. His pyramids were built of men, his obelisks hewn out of\r\nhuman material. A feeble race of shepherds he transformed into a people\r\nbidding defiance to the centuries--a great, eternal, holy people, God's\r\npeople, an exemplar to all other peoples, the prototype of mankind: he\r\ncreated Israel. With greater justice than the Roman poet could this\r\nartist, the son of Amram and Jochebed the midwife, boast of having\r\nerected a monument more enduring than brass.\r\n\r\nAs for the artist, so I lacked reverence for his work, the Jews,\r\ndoubtless on account of my Greek predilections, antagonistic to Judaic\r\nasceticism. My love for Hellas has since declined. Now I understand that\r\nthe Greeks were only beautiful youths, while the Jews have always been\r\nmen, powerful, inflexible men, not only in early times, to-day, too, in\r\nspite of eighteen hundred years of persecution and misery. I have learnt\r\nto appreciate them, and were pride of birth not absurd in a champion of\r\nthe revolution and its democratic principles, the writer of these\r\nleaflets would boast that his ancestors belonged to the noble house of\r\nIsrael, that he is a descendant of those martyrs to whom the world owes\r\nGod and morality, and who have fought and bled on every battlefield of\r\nthought.\"\r\n\r\nIn view of such avowals, Heine's return to Judaism is an indubitable\r\nfact, and when one of his friends anxiously inquired about his relation\r\nto God, he could well answer with a smile: _Dieu me pardonnera; c'est\r\nson metier._ In those days Heine made his will, his true, genuine will,\r\nto have been the first to publish which the present writer will always\r\nconsider the distinction of his life. The introduction reads: \"I die in\r\nthe belief in one God, Creator of heaven and earth, whose mercy I\r\nsupplicate in behalf of my immortal soul. I regret that in my writings I\r\nsometimes spoke of sacred things with levity, due not so much to my own\r\ninclination, as to the spirit of my age. If unwittingly I have offended\r\nagainst good usage and morality, which constitute the true essence of\r\nall monotheistic religions, may God and men forgive me.\"\r\n\r\nWith this confession on his lips Heine passed away, dying in the thick\r\nof the fight, his very bier haunted by the spirits of antagonism and\r\ncontradiction....\r\n\r\n    \"Greek joy in life, belief in God of Jew,\r\n    And twining in and out like arabesques,\r\n    Ivy tendrils gently clasp the two.\"\r\n\r\nIn Heine's character, certainly, there were sharp contrasts. Now we\r\nbehold him a Jew, now a Christian, now a Hellenist, now a romanticist;\r\nto-day laughing, to-morrow weeping, to-day the prophet of the modern\r\nera, to-morrow the champion of tradition. Who knows the man? Yet who\r\nthat steps within the charmed circle of his life can resist the\r\ntemptation to grapple with the enigma?\r\n\r\nOne of the best known of his poems is the plaint:\r\n\r\n    \"Mass for me will not be chanted,\r\n      _Kadosh_ not be said,\r\n    Naught be sung, and naught recited,\r\n      Round my dying bed.\"\r\n\r\nThe poet's prophecy has not come true. As this tribute has in spirit\r\nbeen laid upon his grave, so always thousands will devote kindly thought\r\nto him, recalling in gentleness how he struggled and suffered, wrestled\r\nand aspired; how, at the dawn of the new day, enthusiastically\r\nproclaimed by him, his spirit fled aloft to regions where doubts are set\r\nat rest, hopes fulfilled, and visions made reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MUSIC OF THE SYNAGOGUE[107]\r\n\r\n\r\nLadies and Gentlemen:--Let the emotions aroused by the notes of the\r\ngreat masters, now dying away upon the air, continue to reverberate in\r\nyour souls. More forcibly and more eloquently than my weak words, they\r\nexpress the thoughts and the feelings appropriate to this solemn\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nA festival like ours has rarely been celebrated in Israel. For nearly\r\ntwo thousand years the muse of Jewish melody was silent; during the\r\nwhole of that period, a new chord was but seldom won from the unused\r\nlyre. The Talmud[108] has a quaint tale on the subject: Higros the\r\nLevite living at the time of the decadence of Israel's nationality, was\r\nthe last skilled musician, and he refused to teach his art. When he sang\r\nhis exquisite melodies, touching his mouth with his thumb, and striking\r\nthe strings with his fingers, it is said that his priestly mates,\r\ntransported by the magic power of his art, fell prostrate, and wept.\r\nUnder the Oriental trappings of this tale is concealed regretful anguish\r\nover the decay of old Hebrew song. The altar at Jerusalem was\r\ndemolished, and the songs of Zion, erst sung by the Levitical choirs\r\nunder the leadership of the Korachides, were heard no longer. The\r\nsilence was unbroken, until, in our day, a band of gifted men disengaged\r\nthe old harps from the willows, and once more lured the ancient melodies\r\nfrom their quavering strings.\r\n\r\nTowering head and shoulders above most of the group of restorers is he\r\nin whose honor we are assembled, to whom we bring greeting and\r\ncongratulation. To you, then, Herr Lewandowski, I address myself to\r\noffer you the deep-felt gratitude and the cordial wishes of your\r\nfriends, of the Berlin community, and, I may add, of the whole of\r\nIsrael. You were appointed for large tasks--large tasks have you\r\nsuccessfully performed. At a time when Judaism was at a low ebb, only\r\nscarcely discernible indications promising a brighter future, Providence\r\nsent you to occupy a guide's position in the most important, the\r\nlargest, and the most intelligent Jewish community of Germany. For fifty\r\nyears your zeal, your diligence, your faithfulness, your devotion, your\r\naffectionate reverence for our past, and your exalted gifts, have graced\r\nthe office. Were testimony unto your gifts and character needed, it\r\nwould be given by this day's celebration, proving, as it does, that your\r\nbrethren have understood the underlying thought of your activities, have\r\ngrasped their bearing upon Jewish development, and have appreciated\r\ntheir influence.\r\n\r\nYou have remodelled the divine service of the Jewish synagogue,\r\nsuperadding elements of devotion and sacredness. Under your touch old\r\nlays have clothed themselves with a modern garb--a new rhythm vibrates\r\nthrough our historic melodies, keener strength in the familiar words,\r\nheightened dignity in the cherished songs. Two generations and all parts\r\nof the world have hearkened to your harmonies, responding to them with\r\ntears of joy or sorrow, with feelings stirred from the recesses of the\r\nheart. To your music have listened entranced the boy and the girl on the\r\nday of declaring their allegiance to the covenant of the fathers; the\r\nyouth and the maiden in life's most solemn hour; men and women in all\r\nthe sacred moments of the year, on days of mourning and of festivity.\r\n\r\nA quarter of a century ago, when you celebrated the end of twenty-five\r\nyears of useful work, a better man stood here, and spoke to you. Leopold\r\nZunz on that occasion said to you: \"Old thoughts have been transformed\r\nby you into modern emotions, and long stored words seasoned with your\r\nmelodies have made delicious food.\"\r\n\r\nThis is your share in the revival of Jewish poesy, and what you have\r\nresuscitated, and remodelled, and re-created, will endure, echoing and\r\nre-echoing through all the lands. In you Higros the Levite has been\r\nrestored to us. But your melodies will never sink into oblivious\r\nsilence. They have been carried by an honorable body of disciples to\r\ndistant lands, beyond the ocean, to communities in the remote countries\r\nof civilization. Thus they have become the perpetual inheritance of the\r\ncongregation of Jacob, the people that has ever loved and wooed music,\r\nonly direst distress succeeding in flinging the pall of silence over\r\nsong and melody.\r\n\r\nHoly Writ places the origin of music in the primitive days of man,\r\ntersely pointing out, at the same time, music's conciliatory charms: it\r\nis the descendant of Cain, the fratricide, a son of Lemech, the slayer\r\nof a man to his own wounding, who is said to be the \"father of all such\r\nas play on the harp and guitar\" (_Kinnor_ and _Ugab_). Another of\r\nLemech's sons was the first artificer in every article of copper and\r\niron, the inventor of weapons of war, as the former was the inventor of\r\nstringed instruments. Both used brass, the one to sing, the other to\r\nfight. So music sprang from sorrow and combat. Song and roundelay,\r\ntimbrels and harp, accompanied our forefathers on their wanderings, and\r\npreceded the armed men into battle. So, too, the returning victor was\r\ngreeted, and in the Temple on Moriah's crest, joyful songs of gratitude\r\nextolled the grace of the Lord. From the harp issued the psalm dedicated\r\nto the glory of God--love of art gave rise to the psalter, a song-book\r\nfor the nations, and its author David may be called the founder of the\r\nnational and Temple music of the ancient Hebrews. With his song, he\r\nbanished the evil spirit from Saul's soul; with his skill on the\r\npsaltery, he defeated his enemies, and he led the jubilant chorus in the\r\nHoly City singing to the honor and glory of the Most High.\r\n\r\nCompare the Hebrew and the Hellenic music of ancient times: Orpheus with\r\nhis music charms wild beasts; David's subdues demons. By means of\r\nAmphion's lyre, living walls raise themselves; Israel's cornets make\r\nlevel the ramparts of Jericho. Arion's melodies lure dolphins from the\r\nsea; Hebrew music infuses into the prophet's disciples the spirit of the\r\nLord. These are the wondrous effects of music in Israel and in Hellas,\r\nthe foremost representatives of ancient civilization. Had the one united\r\nwith the other, what celestial harmonies might have resulted! But later,\r\nin the time of Macedonian imperialism, when Alexandria and Jerusalem\r\nmet, the one stood for enervated paganism, the other for a Judaism of\r\ncompromise, and a union of such tones produces no harmonious chords.\r\n\r\nBut little is known of the ancient Hebrew music of the Temple, of the\r\nsingers, the songs, the melodies, and the instruments. The Hebrews had\r\nsongs and instrumental music on all festive, solemn occasions,\r\nparticularly during the divine service. At their national celebrations,\r\nin their homes, at their diversions, even on their journeys and their\r\npilgrimages to the sanctuary, their hymns were at once religious,\r\npatriotic, and social.[109] They had the viol and the cithara, flutes,\r\ncymbals, and castanets, and, if our authorities interpret correctly, an\r\norgan (_magrepha_), whose volume of sound surpassed description. When,\r\non the Day of Atonement, its strains pealed through the chambers of the\r\nTemple, they were heard in the whole of Jerusalem, and all the people\r\nbowed in humble adoration before the Lord of hosts. The old music ceased\r\nwith the overthrow of the Jewish state. The Levites hung their harps on\r\nthe willows of Babylon's streams, and every entreaty for the \"words of\r\nsong\" was met by the reproachful inquiry: \"How should we sing the song\r\nof the Lord on the soil of the stranger?\" Higros the Levite was the last\r\nof Israelitish tone-artists.\r\n\r\nIsrael set out on his fateful wanderings, his unparalleled pilgrimage,\r\nthrough the lands and the centuries, along an endless, thorny path,\r\ndrenched with blood, watered with tears, across nations and thrones,\r\nlonely, terrible, sublime with the stern sublimity of tragic scenes.\r\nThey are not the sights and experiences to inspire joyous songs--melody\r\nis muffled by terror. Only lamentation finds voice, an endless,\r\noppressive, anxious wail, sounding adown, through two thousand years,\r\nlike a long-drawn sigh, reverberating in far-reaching echoes: \"How long,\r\nO Lord, how long!\" and \"When shall a redeemer arise for this people?\"\r\nThese elegiac refrains Israel never wearies of repeating on all his\r\njourneyings. Occasionally a fitful gleam of sunlight glides into the\r\ncrowded Jewish quarters, and at once a more joyous note is heard, rising\r\ntriumphant above the doleful plaint, a note which asserts itself\r\nexultingly on the celebration in memory of the Maccabean heroes, on the\r\ndays of _Purim_, at wedding banquets, at the love-feasts of the pious\r\nbrotherhood. This fusion of melancholy and of rejoicing is the keynote\r\nof mediaeval Jewish music growing out of the grotesque contrasts of\r\nJewish history. Yet, despite its romantic woe, it is informed with the\r\nspirit of a remote past, making it the legitimate offspring of ancient\r\nHebrew music, whose characteristics, to be sure, we arrive at only by\r\nguesswork. Of that mediaeval music of ours, the poet's words are true:\r\n\"It rejoices so pathetically, it laments so joyfully.\"\r\n\r\nWhoever has heard, will never forget Israel's melodies, breaking forth\r\ninto rejoicing, then cast down with sadness: flinging out their notes to\r\nthe skies, then sinking into an abyss of grief: now elated, now\r\noppressed; now holding out hope, now moaning forth sorrow and pain. They\r\nconvey the whole of Judah's history--his glorious past, his mournful\r\npresent, his exalted future promised by God. As their tones flood our\r\nsoul, a succession of visions passes before our mental view: the Temple\r\nin all its unexampled splendor, the exultant chorus of Levites, the\r\npriests discharging their holy office, the venerable forms of the\r\npatriarchs, the lawgiver-guide of the people, prophets with uplifted\r\nfinger of warning, worthy rabbis, pale-faced martyrs of the middle ages;\r\nbut the melodies conjuring before our minds all these shadowy figures\r\nhave but one burden: \"How should we sing the song of the Lord on the\r\nsoil of the stranger?\"\r\n\r\nThat is the ever-recurring _motif_ of the Jewish music of the middle\r\nages. But the blending of widely different emotions is not favorable in\r\nthe creation of melody. Secular occurrences set their seal upon\r\nreligious music, of which some have so high a conception as to call it\r\none of the seven liberal arts, or even to extol it beyond poetry. Jacob\r\nLevi of Mayence (Maharil), living at the beginning of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, is considered the founder of German synagogue music, but his\r\nproductions remained barren of poetic and devotional results. He drew\r\nhis best subjects from alien sources. At the time of the Italian\r\nRenaissance, music had so firmly established itself in the appreciation\r\nof the people that a preacher, Judah Muscato, devoted the first of his\r\ncelebrated sermons to music, assigning to it a high mission among the\r\narts. He interpreted the legend of David's AEolian harp as a beautiful\r\nallegory. Basing his explanation on a verse in the Psalms, he showed\r\nthat it symbolizes a spiritual experience of the royal bard. Another\r\nwriter, Abraham ben David Portaleone, found the times still riper; he\r\ncould venture to write a theory of music, as taught him by his teachers,\r\nSamuel Arkevolti and Menahem Lonsano, both of whom had strongly opposed\r\nthe use of certain secular melodies then current in Italy, Germany,\r\nFrance, and Turkey for religious songs. Among Jewish musicians in the\r\nlatter centuries of the middle ages, the most prominent was Solomon\r\nRossi. He, too, failed to exercise influence on the shaping of Jewish\r\nmusic, which more and more delighted in grotesqueness and aberrations\r\nfrom good taste. The origin of synagogue melodies was attributed to\r\nremoter and remoter periods; the most soulful hymns were adapted to\r\nfrivolous airs. Later still, at a time when German music had risen to\r\nits zenith, when Bach, Handel, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven flourished,\r\nthe Jewish strolling musician _Klesmer_, a mendicant in the world of\r\nsong as in the world of finance, was wandering through the provinces\r\nwith his two mates.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a new era dawned for Israel, too. The sun of humanity sent a\r\nfew of its rays into the squalid Ghetto. Its walls fell before the\r\ntrumpet blast of deliverance. On all sides sounded the cry for liberty.\r\nThe brotherhood of man, embracing all, did not exclude storm-baptized\r\nIsrael. The old synagogue had to keep pace with modern demands, and was\r\narrayed in a new garb. Among those who designed and fashioned the new\r\ngarment, he is prominent in whose honor we have met to-day.\r\n\r\nFrom our short journey through the centuries of music, we have returned\r\nto him who has succeeded in the great work of restoring to its honorable\r\nplace the music of the synagogue, sorely missed, ardently longed for,\r\nand bringing back to us old songs in a new guise. An old song and a new\r\nmelody! The old song of abiding love, loyalty, and resignation to the\r\nwill of God! His motto was the beautiful verse: \"My strength and my song\r\nis the Lord\"; and his unchanging refrain, the jubilant exclamation:\r\n\"Blessed be thou, fair Musica!\" A wise man once said: \"Hold in high\r\nhonor our Lady of Music!\" The wise man was Martin Luther--another\r\ninstance this of the conciliatory power of music, standing high above\r\nthe barriers raised by religious differences. It is worthy of mention,\r\non this occasion, that at the four hundredth anniversary celebration in\r\nhonor of Martin Luther, in the Sebaldus church at Nuremberg, the most\r\nProtestant of the cities of Germany, called by Luther himself \"the eye\r\nof God,\" a psalm of David was sung to music composed by our guest of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\"Hold in high honor our Lady of Music!\" We will be admonished by the\r\nbehest, and give honor to the artist by whose fostering care the music\r\nof the synagogue enjoys a new lease of life; who, with pious zeal, has\r\ncollected our dear old melodies, and has sung them to us with all the\r\nardor and power with which God in His kindness endowed him.\r\n\r\n    \"The sculptor must simulate life, of the poet I demand intelligence;\r\n    The soul can be expressed only by Polyhymnia!\"\r\n\r\nAn orphan, song wandered hither and thither through the world, met,\r\nafter many days, by the musician, who compassionately adopted it, and\r\nclothed it with his melodies. On the pinions of music, it now soars\r\nwhithersoever it listeth, bringing joy and blessing wherever it alights.\r\n\"The old song, the new melody!\" Hark! through the silence of the night\r\nin this solemn moment, one of those old songs, clad by our _maestro_ in\r\na new melody, falls upon our ears: \"I remember unto thee the kindness of\r\nthy youth, the love of thy espousals, thy going after me in the\r\nwilderness, through a land that is not sown!\"\r\n\r\nHearken! Can we not distinguish in its notes, as they fill our ears, the\r\npresage of a music of the future, of love and good-will? We seem to hear\r\nthe rustle of the young leaves of a new spring, the resurrection\r\nforetold thousands of years agone by our poets and prophets. We see\r\nslowly dawning that great day on which mankind, awakened from the fitful\r\nsleep of error and delusion, will unite in the profession of the creed\r\nof brotherly love, and Israel's song will be mankind's song, myriads of\r\nvoices in unison sending aloft to the skies the psalm of praise:\r\nHallelujah, Hallelujah!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAaron, medical writer, 79\r\n\r\nAbbahu, Haggadist, 21\r\n\r\nAbbayu, rabbi, quoted, 232-233\r\n\r\nAbina, rabbi, 19\r\n\r\nAbitur, poet, 24\r\n\r\nAboab, Isaac, writer, 45, 130\r\n\r\nAboab, Samuel, Bible scholar, 45\r\n\r\nAbrabanel, Isaac, scholar and statesman, 42, 99\r\n\r\nAbrabanel, Judah, 42, 95\r\n\r\nAbraham in Africa, 255\r\n\r\nAbraham Bedersi, poet, 171\r\n\r\nAbraham ben Chiya, scientist, 83, 93\r\n\r\nAbraham ben David Portaleone, musician, 376\r\n\r\nAbraham de Balmes, physician, 95\r\n\r\nAbraham dei Mansi, Talmudist, 116\r\n\r\nAbraham ibn Daud, philosopher, 35\r\n\r\nAbraham ibn Ezra, exegete, 36\r\n  mathematician, 83\r\n\r\nAbraham ibn Sahl, poet, 34, 88\r\n\r\nAbraham Judaeus.

His monumental work promises to be the standard by which\r\nall other Jewish histories are to be measured by Jews for many years to\r\ncome.--_Baltimore American._\r\n\r\nWhenever the subject constrains the author to discuss the Christian\r\nreligion, he is animated by a spirit not unworthy of the philosophic and\r\nhigh-minded hero of Lessing's \"Nathan the Wise.\"--_New York Sun._\r\n\r\nIt is an exhaustive and scholarly work, for which the student of history\r\nhas reason to be devoutly thankful....
