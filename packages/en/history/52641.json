This is known by the somewhat unsuggestive name of the\r\nTolhouse. Its relation to the collection of tolls is referred to in many\r\nold documents; but since this was but one of many uses to which it was\r\ndevoted, and far from a primary one, it is highly probable that, like\r\nthe Tolbooth of Edinburgh, its name is derived from its use in a greater\r\ndegree as the common prison of the town.\r\n\r\nThe building is spoken of by the old local historian, Manship, in 1619,\r\nwho states that it was used in his time as the Borough Gaol, and had\r\nbeen so used from the time of the granting of the Charter by King John\r\nto the Burgesses. There are also records, which are referred to in\r\nPalmer’s “Perlustrations of Great Yarmouth,” of the very early use of\r\nthe building as a gaol by the burgesses. A gaol for prisoners was also\r\ngranted by Henry III. in 1261.\r\n\r\nApart from this, the building has been used for almost every municipal\r\npurpose, though it has never been actually a town-hall, for Great\r\nYarmouth, like many other corporations, possessed a town-hall over or\r\nbeside the entrance to the churchyard. Here various courts were held.\r\nThe bailiffs were accustomed to receive their tolls or dues in the great\r\nchamber on the first floor. It was called the Host House, from a\r\npeculiar local custom. The accounts for the herrings, the staple article\r\nof commerce of the town in old days as now, that were caught by foreign\r\nfishermen, and sold by their “hosts,” or salesmen of the town to whom\r\nthey were consigned, had to be settled in the great chamber, and their\r\n“heightening money” paid. It was used also as their apartment of state\r\nby the local authorities; and there are many records of the quarrels\r\nover the questions of precedence with the deputies of the Cinque Ports\r\nwhen they paid official visits here.\r\n\r\nIt is for these most varying uses that the Tolhouse of Great Yarmouth is\r\nunique among our municipal antiquities, for England has not its\r\ncounterpart elsewhere. Its history affords evidence of a most\r\ninteresting nature of the growth and development of the authority of the\r\ntown, no different it may be from what has taken place in other\r\ncorporations, but illustrated here by the actual building.\r\n\r\nThe structure also is the original erection in all its essential\r\nfeatures. Its walls are of early thirteenth century date, thus\r\nindicating its existence prior to 1261. It has a picturesque external\r\nstaircase of open woodwork, giving access from the street to the level\r\nof the first floor, where the “Great Chamber” is situated, access being\r\ngained through a doorway of Early English moulded work; while the lobby\r\nof approach is lighted by a two-light open arcade, of somewhat later\r\ndate. A very quaint figure of Justice, with sword and scales, stands on\r\na projecting buttress; and the high-pitched roof, and the general\r\nfeatures of the design, are both of considerable artistic interest.\r\nInternally, the Great Chamber has lost its open roof, which was replaced\r\nby a flat ceiling, probably in 1622, when it was “fitted up for\r\nassemblies.” The windows, too, are square-headed, with wood frames and\r\nmullions; but there are several features of the original work of great\r\nbeauty, while others peep temptingly from the plastering and whitewash\r\nof more recent days.\r\n\r\nBelow the Hall is the “pit,” or common hold, wherein prisoners were\r\nthrust indiscriminately, and chained to a horizontal beam, which has\r\nlong since disappeared. In this portion of the building the doors are\r\niron-bound, and very solidly framed.\r\n\r\nThe recent history of the building deserves more than passing reference.\r\nOn the completion of the handsome new town-hall the few recent uses even\r\nof the Tolhouse were no longer needed, and the demolition of the\r\nbuilding was decided upon. The local antiquaries, however, being fully\r\nalive to the great interest of the building in relation to its forming a\r\npart, so to speak, of the history of the town, strove to prevent this\r\nloss occurring. Their persevering efforts have been eminently\r\nsuccessful. Not only has the Town Council reconsidered the proposal,\r\nbut it has finally handed the building over to trustees, to be devoted\r\nto some useful purpose. Thus has an example been set to other lovers of\r\nour ancient buildings elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe trustees have undertaken to repair the building, and they are now\r\nseeking to raise a fund for defraying the cost of this much-needed work.\r\nThe building is in a sadly dilapidated state. It has been surveyed by\r\nMr. E. P. Loftus Brock, F.S.A., architect, of London, and in his hands,\r\nand in those of a local firm of architects, it may be reasonably\r\nconcluded that none but really necessary works will be carried out. The\r\nintention is, indeed, to repair the building only, and to retain all its\r\nancient features.\r\n\r\nThe rough-cast, covering and hiding the ancient walling, will be taken\r\noff, the great hall will have its flat ceiling removed, and some\r\napproach made to the open appearance it formerly possessed; the walls\r\nwill be strengthened where needed, the roofs made watertight, and\r\ngeneral works of cleansing and repair done. No attempt whatever will be\r\nmade to alter the structural appearance.\r\n\r\nThe trustees have undertaken their duties on public grounds, in the\r\nbelief that, in these days when the removal of an ancient building is so\r\ngreatly deplored, funds will not be wanting to uphold it for all time.\r\n\r\nSubscriptions will be gladly received by C. S. Ade, Esq., Treasurer of\r\nthe Fund (Messrs. Gurney & Co., Great Yarmouth); or by F. Danby-Palmer,\r\nEsq., Honorary Secretary, also at Great Yarmouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMisericordes in Ludlow Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE following details of sundry carvings on the misericordes still\r\nremaining in the choir of the collegiate church of St. Lawrence at\r\nLudlow, in Shropshire, may interest such of our readers as are students\r\nof church architecture:--\r\n\r\nNORTH SIDE.

C. HOPE, F.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharacters of the Wars of the Roses.\r\n\r\nBY THE REV. H. H. MOORE, M.A.\r\n\r\n_PART II._\r\n\r\n(_Continued from Vol. V. p. 282._)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE characters of Warwick and of Edward IV. were so similar up to a\r\ncertain point, and beyond that so opposite, their fortunes were so\r\nclosely intertwined up to a certain time and afterwards were so fatally\r\nantagonistic, that they must be considered together awhile. The virtues\r\nof the one shine the brighter, and the defects of the other loom the\r\ndarker by contrast; and the juxtaposition of the two figures in history\r\nmakes the contrast all the more striking. In Warwick we see the nobler\r\nand more antique form of chivalry; in Edward we see chivalry modernised\r\nand debased by the additions of a voluptuousness more vicious than\r\nrefined, and of a selfishness Italian in its intensity, and\r\nMachiavellian in its policy. Equally brave and distinguished for\r\npersonal prowess in the field, Warwick joined to the courage the\r\nmagnanimity of the lion, while Edward showed the cruelty as well as the\r\nfierceness of the tiger. But Edward greatly excelled Warwick, as well as\r\nall the other captains of his day, in generalship. His boldness, which\r\ncared for no odds however great, which shunned no danger however\r\ndesperate, would have seemed mere foolhardiness, had not his\r\nmarvellously quick perception, sagacious judgment, and tremendous\r\nenergy, made prudence foolish and boldness prudent. His confidence in\r\nhis own powers, which made them ten times more formidable, was fully\r\njustified by the results of nine pitched battles, in which victory never\r\nleft his standard. But as soon as the opposition was overcome which had\r\nroused his energies into so fierce an activity, he abandoned himself to\r\nluxurious habits and indulgence in amorous and convivial pleasures. They\r\nwho had seen him awhile ago delighting like a war-horse in the sound of\r\nthe battle, would never expect such “a martial man to become soft\r\nfancy’s slave.” Yet so it was; terrible as Cæsar in war, in peace he was\r\nanother Antony, and would risk the loss of an empire for a woman’s\r\nsmile. His generous affection for Elizabeth Woodville would be a bright\r\nspot in his character, had he not sullied it by his numerous amours and\r\ngross licentiousness. While Edward thus stained his character as much by\r\nhis wantonness in peace as by his cruelty in war, Warwick, who despised\r\nsuch pleasures, won from both equally honourable laurels. The young\r\nKing’s Court was no genial place for his severe manliness; and the\r\ndisgraceful match-making and place-hunting by which the Queen’s\r\nrelatives and friends were acquiring power, not only disgusted, but also\r\nalarmed him for the power of his family and of the old nobility. Edward\r\nand Warwick were equally proud, but Warwick’s was the pride of conscious\r\nworth, Edward’s the pride of an arbitrary will. More kingly than the\r\nKing himself, Warwick overshadowed the throne with his greatness. To him\r\nEdward knew that he owed his crown, but he felt that he was strong\r\nenough to keep it without his help. His gratitude was swallowed up in\r\nthe humiliation of his dependence, for he felt that he was not a king\r\nwhen Warwick was by. Accordingly, all his efforts were directed to abase\r\nthat power which made him feel like a subject in his own realms.\r\nWarwick’s fall would, he knew, be the death-blow to his order; and, once\r\ndetermined on this policy, not even fear of Warwick moved this wonderful\r\nman, whose hand never hesitated to execute what his heart dared to\r\ndesign. He saw that the age was with him, while Warwick and the men of\r\nwhom he was the type were behind the age. He knew also the advantage\r\nwhich his own character and talents gave him over Warwick. The latter\r\nwas honest, unsuspecting, incapable of intrigue as he was indisposed to\r\nit; and though he joined to these soldier’s qualities a soldier’s\r\nsagacity also, yet he was no match for Edward, and fell an easy victim\r\nto his perfidious heart and scheming brain. And when outraged honour and\r\ninsulted pride made him desert the Yorkist cause, which he had served\r\nand supported for years, and range himself with those whom he had most\r\ninjured and who most hated him, he fell as easy a victim to the same\r\nman’s charmed sword. And Edward did prove himself strong enough to reign\r\nalone. No man was better fitted for his age and his circumstances; and\r\nthis is shown by his popularity, vigorous even during Warwick’s life and\r\nwhile growing under his shade. Victor everywhere and at all times,\r\nEdward had won the heart of the nation even before he gained the throne.\r\nThe painful tragedy of his father’s death, his own youth, beauty,\r\nprincely bearing and accomplishments, excited the sympathy and\r\nadmiration of the people on his earliest appearance on the stage on\r\nwhich he was to play so great a part. His successful fortunes in war,\r\nand Warwick’s support, had commended young Edward to a people who had\r\nnothing to lose in losing Henry VI., and who hoped at least to gain\r\npeace and security under the protection of an arm which promised to be\r\nas strong to hold as it had been to acquire. Their minds, sickened by\r\nthe gloom and horrors of war, were refreshed by the sight of their young\r\nKing throwing himself with all the ardour of his nature into the light\r\namusements and pleasures of peace; the citizens were charmed by his\r\naffability, their wives and daughters by his gaiety and gallantry. A new\r\nnobility, the mushroom growth of an hour, sprang up to sun itself in his\r\nsmiles, to help him in the pursuit of pleasure, to increase the\r\nattractions of peace and of a Court. The commercial towns, and\r\nespecially London, were pleased with a monarch who enriched them by his\r\nmagnificent and sumptuous expenditure, and who gave a more liberal\r\nencouragement to commerce than they had known before. But two classes\r\nstood aloof and sullen: the old nobility, who felt that they were losing\r\nboth their place and power in the Court and in the State; and those of\r\nthe people who felt that, whether York or Lancaster were uppermost, they\r\nequally lost their rights, and failed to better their condition. The\r\nbattlefields of Barnet and Tewkesbury rendered this dangerous element\r\nharmless for the future, and Edward, now able to breathe more freely\r\nthan he had done heretofore, gave himself up without restraint to the\r\nimpulses of his passions. His life henceforth became one voluptuous\r\nrevel. The people were more ready to turn with him and his courtiers to\r\npleasure than to criticise and condemn their vices; and so, in peace as\r\nin war, Edward’s sail was filled by the favouring breath of popularity.\r\nHis love for his children and care for their education, his\r\ncourteousness, his wisdom in weakening the power of the nobility, his\r\nencouragement of commerce, and his statesmanship, enlightened for those\r\ndays, are all good points in Edward’s favour, and should be valued at\r\ntheir proper worth; but the possession of the ordinary virtues, and the\r\nperformance of the ordinary duties of a prince and a parent, cannot\r\nfully redeem and make up for his extraordinary vice, perfidiousness,\r\nselfishness, and cruelty; and in the opinion of an age that is not\r\ndazzled by his fortune and ability, Edward’s hard, worldly, fleshly\r\nnature cannot be deemed worthy of admiration.\r\n\r\nRichard III. and Henry VII. are but little concerned in the actual\r\nconduct of the civil war; not at all in its origin, but chiefly in\r\nfurthering its effects, or reaping its fruits; but few words therefore\r\nneed be spent on them here, as it is their policy rather than their\r\npersonal characters that is of chief interest. The same terribly\r\nprecocious development of an unscrupulous will and of a heart steeled\r\nagainst mercy, marks the character of Richard III. as that we have seen\r\nin Edward IV. The school of civil war in which he had been trained\r\ntaught him to despise the barriers which could be removed by the\r\nshedding of blood, and none ever showed greater aptness in improving on\r\nthe lessons he had learned. He equalled Louis XI. in dissimulation, in\r\ncunning, in statesmanship; he equalled his brother Edward in\r\nfearlessness and inflexible purpose; he surpassed him in learning and\r\nmental culture. In the estimation of some minds the special pleading of\r\nHorace Walpole and others may have succeeded in clearing Richard’s name\r\nof the crimes imputed to him, but the majority in this age, as in\r\nRichard’s own, who do not demand positive proofs of everything, but\r\njudge by the laws of probability, cannot help feeling (rightly or not) a\r\nmoral certainty of his guilt.\r\n\r\nThe character of Henry VII. was admirably adapted to heal the sores and\r\nbind the wounds caused by the long civil war. Sufficiently bold, if\r\nnecessity demanded it, he was yet disinclined to war; cold and cautious\r\nin temperament, he was little tolerant of any disturbing element of\r\npassion, and greatly averse to violent and extreme measures which might\r\nderange the stability and order of his government. Eminently practical\r\nin his views of men and of affairs--in this ushering in the modern order\r\nof rulers and of statesmen--he preferred the reality to the show of\r\npower, peace to war, order to misrule, wealth to poverty, domestic\r\nsecurity to foreign aggrandisement.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Richard, Duke of York, hesitating when he should have\r\nbeen bold, and bold when he should have hesitated, with a heart that\r\ncould not keep pace with his ambition, without the wisdom to justify his\r\npretensions by the Right which is derived from Might, not sufficiently\r\nscrupulous to resist temptation, and too scrupulous to win the prize\r\nthat tempted, ensuring his son’s success by his own failure; the\r\namiable, generous, unsuspecting Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester; the wily,\r\navaricious, scheming Suffolk; the bold, grasping, passionate Cardinal\r\nBeaufort; the accomplished courtier, boon companion, and skilful\r\ngeneral, Montacute (brother to Warwick); George, Duke of Clarence,\r\nunstable as water, changeable as the wind, uniting a weak head to a bad\r\nheart; Earl Rivers, accomplished, brave, learned, and a patron of\r\nlearning, the type of the modern nobleman; the high-spirited,\r\nunfortunate son of Margaret; Lord Hastings, the gay gallant, the daring\r\nknight, the sage in the council, the scholar in the study; all these\r\nand many more helped to swell the list of the horrid deeds, or served to\r\nsupply the victims of those bloodstained times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Legend of King Arthur in Somerset.\r\n\r\nBy MRS.

Among the petty kings of the West was Leodogran, King of\r\nCameliard, a county represented at this day by Camelot or Cadbury-fort,\r\nand a cluster of other places in the east of Somerset, whose names are\r\nderived from the same root: North and South Cadbury, Queen’s Camel, West\r\nCamel, and Castle Cary. Leodogran’s kingdom had been beset by the\r\ninvaders, and overrun with wild beasts: Arthur had come to his help and\r\nrescued his dominions. So it came to pass that when his people spake to\r\nhim of marriage, Guinivere, the fair daughter of Leodogran, came to his\r\nmind, and he asked her of her father. The King of Cameliard was well\r\npleased, and with his daughter’s hand he promised him his greatest\r\ntreasure, the Table round, and made him his heir.\r\n\r\nBut Guinivere, in her pride of youth and beauty, had little noted her\r\nfather’s deliverer, and scarce glanced at the young knight, who paid her\r\nnone of the homage she thought her due, and who was ever engrossed in\r\nearnest consultations with her father on the state of the kingdom, on\r\nknights and wars, on castles and sieges; and so it came to pass that\r\nwhen Launcelot, Arthur’s best and most trusted knight, was sent by him\r\nto fetch her home, she, never doubting but that the King would have come\r\nhimself, thought Launcelot was Arthur, and when she saw him her heart\r\nleapt to his. But when she came to see her pure and stainless lord, he\r\nseemed cold and passionless beside Launcelot; and he, who had no\r\nthought of guile and loved when he trusted, and trusted when he loved,\r\ngave them unconsciously opportunities of meeting, and Guinivere’s heart\r\npassed more and more from Arthur, and attached itself more and more\r\npassionately to Launcelot. For Arthur was taken up with affairs of\r\nstate, and with his beautiful dream of the Knights of the Round Table.\r\nIn this order none was higher than other; and here, in his Palace of\r\nCamelot, built by Merlin’s magic power in a single night, he would\r\nassemble a hundred and fifty knights of noble birth, pure and stainless\r\nlike himself, and the Knights bound themselves by solemn oaths to keep\r\nthe rules of the order. They were as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. That every knight should be well armed and furnished to undertake any\r\nenterprise wherein he was employed by sea or by land, on horseback, or\r\non foot.\r\n\r\n2. That he should be ever prest (ready) to assail all tyrants or\r\noppressors of the people.\r\n\r\n3. That he should protect widows and maids, restore children to their\r\njust rights, repossess such persons as without just cause were exiled,\r\nand with all his force maintain the Christian faith.\r\n\r\n4. That he should be a champion for the public weal, and as a lion\r\nrepulse the enemies of his country.\r\n\r\n5. That he should advance the reputation of honour and suppress all\r\nvice, relieve the afflicted by adverse fortune, give aid to Holy Church,\r\nand protect pilgrims.\r\n\r\n6. That he should bury soldiers that wanted sepulture, deliver\r\nprisoners, ransom captives, and cure men hurt in the services of their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n7. That he should in all honourable actions adventure his person, yet\r\nwith respect to justice and truth, and in all enterprises proceed\r\nsincerely, never failing to use the utmost force of body and labour of\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n8. That after the attaining of an enterprise he should cause it to be\r\nrecorded, to the end the fame of the fact might ever live to the eternal\r\nhonour and renown of the noble order.\r\n\r\n9. That if any complaint were made at the court of this mighty king, of\r\nperjury and oppression, then some knight of the order whom the King\r\nshould appoint ought to revenge the same.\r\n\r\n10. That if any knight of foreign nation did come into the Court, with\r\ndesire to challenge or make any show of prowess (were he single or\r\naccompanied) those knights ought to be ready in arms to make answer.\r\n\r\n11. That if any lady, gentleman, or widow, or maid, or other oppressed\r\nperson did present a petition declaring that they were or had been in\r\nthis or other nations injured or offered dishonour, that they should be\r\ngraciously heard, and without delay one or more knights should be sent\r\nto take revenge.\r\n\r\n12. That every knight should be willing to inform young princes, lords,\r\nand gentlemen, in the orders and exercises of arms, thereby not only to\r\navoid idleness, but also to increase the honour of knighthood and\r\nchivalry. Such were the rules which, combined with the disturbed state\r\nof the country, caused that--\r\n\r\n    “Every morning brought a noble chance,\r\n     And every chance brought out a noble knight.”\r\n\r\nIt may, as I have before stated, have been probably the taking of\r\nWinchester by the Saxon Cerdic in 515 which caused Arthur to concentrate\r\nhis forces in the Western Peninsula. Cameliard was now his, in right of\r\nhis wife. He determined therefore to fortify his kingdom, and at the\r\nthree extreme points to place strong castles, which he strengthened by\r\nevery available means. These points were Caerleon on Usk, which guarded\r\nthe Sabrina or estuary of the Severn, and St. Michael’s Mount at the\r\nextreme south-west; but the post of danger and therefore of honour was\r\nheld by Camelot. He pitched with an experienced eye upon this great\r\nBelgic fortress, situated in one of the most fertile and picturesque\r\nparts of South Somerset, as the place where the great stand must be\r\nmade. The shape of the mound is irregular, neither quite round nor\r\nsquare; part of it was hewed from the solid rock, its circumference is\r\nabout a mile. Four deep ditches in concentric rings with as many\r\nramparts of earth and stones form the primary defences: these are\r\nfurther strengthened by a series of zig-zag terraces on inclined planes,\r\nso constructed that the besieged, though he retreated from his\r\nassailants, could still make a desperate resistance. On the top of this\r\nfortified mount is a moated mount or Prætorium, enclosing a space of at\r\nleast twenty acres; and here Merlin raised the enchanted Palace of\r\nCamelot. The spot must have been well-nigh impregnable in days when\r\nartillery was unknown.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was Arthur’s great rallying point; hither the persecuted\r\nfled for protection, the wronged for redress, the patriotic to assist in\r\nthe defence of their county. Every possibility of defence and adornment\r\nwas lavished here; and here were held, specially at Whitsuntide,\r\nchapters of the order of the Knights of the Round Table. Here, in\r\nintervals of peace, were held the mimic games of warfare, and from\r\nhere, after a time of repose, they issued forth again and again against\r\nthe heathen hordes. Within the Greater Triangle was a smaller and more\r\nsacred one; its three points were the Tor Hill at Glastonbury, the Mons\r\nAcutus or Montacute, and Camelot itself; lines drawn from point to point\r\nmade an equilateral triangle, each side being twelve miles in length.\r\nThis twice, trebly guarded territory was defended by saintly shield from\r\ninvasion, and from any noxious or venomous creature.\r\n\r\nIt was the year 520 A.D. Exactly one hundred years had elapsed since the\r\nlast Roman soldiers left Britain a prey to their enemies. But what a\r\ndifferent Britain it was now. It is true the enemy were in the land, and\r\nheld the greater part of it, but the Britons were no longer helpless or\r\nhopeless. From the towers of Camelot Arthur led forth an army full of\r\nconfidence and eager for the fray; he led them beyond the bounds of\r\nGladerhaf, for he would not that this beloved land should be soiled by\r\nthe heathen’s tread. At Mount Badon, in Wiltshire, was fought the great\r\nbattle in which Arthur was victorious, and the onward march of the\r\nSaxons was stayed for the time. At Camelot watch and ward was kept; from\r\nits summit could be seen the Mendip Hills, in the West of Somerset, the\r\nBlackdown summits in Devonshire, and the Bristol Channel on the south.\r\nTwelve great battles did Arthur fight; the eleventh is said by some to\r\nhave been fought near Camelot, but I hold rather that the traces of a\r\ngreat conflict, which have been discovered there, took place in more\r\nrecent times, when the Saxon dominion was extending itself still further\r\nto the West. For Gladerhaf remained British till after Arthur’s time,\r\nnor did Glastonbury pass under the Saxon sway till after they too had\r\nembraced Christianity, and conquerors and conquered knelt together at\r\nthe same shrine.\r\n\r\nThe tale of King Ryence’s challenge belongs partly to Caerleon and\r\npartly to Camelot. It may be found in full in Mallory’s “King Arthur,”\r\nand also in a ballad preserved in “Percy’s Reliques of Ancient Poetry.”\r\nKing Ryence, a potentate of North Wales, sent to Arthur at Caerleon to\r\ndemand his beard, as he needed one more to make up the tale of twelve\r\nRoyal beards, with which to “purfle his mantle.” If it were refused, he\r\nwould slay him, and lay waste his country. Arthur, who was then young,\r\nanswered that his beard would scarce answer for the purpose he required\r\nit, but threw back his threat upon himself. Shortly afterwards Ryence\r\nwas brought as a prisoner to Camelot, and Arthur seems to have been\r\ncontent with this humiliation, and to have retaliated no further upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAmongst the treasures brought by Joseph of Arimathea to Britain were two\r\nof priceless worth; one, a thorn taken from our Lord’s brow, the other\r\nthe cup from which the Lord drank at the last supper. The first was\r\nplanted by Joseph, and slips from it planted in various places still\r\nremain, which, according to all contemporary folk-lore, flower\r\ninvariably on old Christmas Eve (the Epiphany). But still more precious\r\nwas the Sangreal, or cup, out of which our Lord drank at the last\r\nsupper. It had been preserved for ages at Glastonbury, but on account of\r\nthe grievous sins which prevailed, and the disordered state of the\r\ncountry, it had been caught away. But now a rumour arose, no one knew\r\nhow or where, that the Sangreal had been seen again, and here seemed the\r\nsalve for all their wounds, the cure for all their troubles, the\r\ntalisman which was to preserve them from all ill; so men were waiting\r\nand wondering for what was to come to pass, they knew not what.\r\n\r\nPentecost had come, and a chapter of the order of the Knights of the\r\nRound Table was held as usual at Camelot. The knights were assembled in\r\nthe great hall of the Castle. Anon a cracking and crying as of thunder\r\nwas heard, and they thought the palace would break asunder. In the midst\r\nentered a sunbeam more clear by seven times than ever they saw day. Then\r\nthe knights beheld each other fairer than they had ever seen them\r\nbefore, and no knight might speak a word for a great while, and each man\r\nlooked on the other as they had been dumb. Then entered into the hall\r\nthe holy grail, covered with white samite; but none might see it, nor\r\nwho bare it, and all the hall was filled with sweet odours, and the holy\r\nvessel departed suddenly, and they wist not whence it came.[1]\r\n\r\nDumb were they all for a time; then spoke the light and foolish Sir\r\nGawaine, and took an oath that he would go on a quest for the Sangreal,\r\nand would search for it, at least a year and a day, until he found it.\r\nThen the other knights swore to the same. It was with bitter grief that\r\nArthur learned the vow, for well he knew that high and holy gifts are\r\ngiven by God to those who are in their ordinary way of duty, as the\r\nangels came to the shepherds whilst they kept their sheep, and that this\r\nwild quest would but disperse the knights throughout the land, while\r\nthey neglected the work that God had set them, viz., the defence of\r\ntheir own land against the heathen. Then said the King: “I am sure at\r\nthis quest of the Sangreal shall all of ye of the Round Table depart,\r\nand never shall I see you whole together again, therefore will I see\r\nyou all whole together in the meadow of Camelot, for to joust and\r\ntourney, that after your death men may speak of it, that such good\r\nknights were wholly together on such a day. So were they all assembled\r\nin the meadow, both more and less.”\r\n\r\nArthur’s last tournament was held, and the maiden-knight, Sir Galahad,\r\nwon the honours of the day. Then, when the tourney was over, the whole\r\nassembly went to the Minster, and there, for the last time, joined all\r\ntogether in holy rites of prayer and praise. Then said the King to Sir\r\nGawaine: “Alas! ye have well nigh slain me with the vow and promise that\r\nye have made, for through you ye have bereft me of the fairest\r\nfellowship and the truest knighthood that ever were seen together in any\r\nrealm of the world, for when they shall depart from hence I am sure that\r\nall shall never meet more in this world, for then shall many die in this\r\nquest, and so it forethinketh me a little, for I have loved them as well\r\nas my life.” The next morning the knights rode out of Camelot. But the\r\nstory of their adventures does not belong to Somerset.[2]\r\n\r\nBehind all this bravery and fair seeming, however, was rising a dark\r\ncloud, which did more to break up Arthur’s Table-round than even the\r\nquest of the Sangreal; for rumours had long been rife that Guinivere was\r\nunfaithful, and that his best-beloved knight, Sir Launcelot, was the\r\npartner of her sin. It was long ere they reached Arthur, who was so\r\nguileless that he could not believe in the guilt of those he loved; but\r\nat last it became too manifest, and Guinivere’s flight made the\r\nunfaithfulness of his wife and his friend patent to the King.\r\nGuinivere’s first flight was to Glastonbury; and in a life of Gildas,\r\nwritten by Caradoc of Lancarvon, we are told that whilst he (Gildas) was\r\nresiding at Glastonbury, Arthur’s Queen was carried off and lodged\r\nthere, that Arthur immediately besieged the place, but, through the\r\nmediation of the Abbot and of Gildas, consented at length to receive his\r\nwife again and to depart peaceably.[3] When this first flight took place\r\nwe are not told; but after a time, and when the rebellion of his nephew,\r\nMordred, took place, Guinivere fled again, this time to Amesbury, in\r\nWiltshire. There she was professed a nun. After her death her body was\r\ncarried to rest at Glastonbury by Sir Launcelot himself, she having\r\nprayed that she might never see him again in life. And when she was put\r\ninto the earth, Sir Launcelot swooned, and lay long upon the ground. A\r\nhermit came and awaked him, and said: “Ye are to blame, for ye displease\r\nGod with such manner of sorrow-making.” “Truly,” said Sir Launcelot, “I\r\ntrust I do not displease God, for He knoweth well mine intent, for it\r\nwas not, nor is for any rejoicing of sin; but my sorrow may never have\r\nan end. For when I remember and call to mind her beauty, her bounty, and\r\nher nobleness, that was as well with her King, my lord Arthur, as with\r\nher; and also when I saw the corpse of that noble King and noble Queen\r\nso lie together in that cold grave, made of earth, that sometime were so\r\nhighly set in most honourable places, truly mine heart would not serve\r\nme to sustain my wretched and careful body also. And when I remember me,\r\nhow through my default, and through my presumption and pride, that they\r\nwere both laid full low, the which were ever peerless that ever were\r\nliving of Christian people. Wit ye well,” said Sir Launcelot, “this\r\nremembered of their kindness, and of mine unkindness, sunk and impressed\r\nso in my heart, that all my natural strength failed me, so that I might\r\nnot sustain myself.”\r\n\r\nThe rebellion of his nephew Mordred brought strife and war into the\r\nhitherto carefully guarded peninsula. Mordred maintained that Arthur was\r\nno son of Uther Pendragon; and that he himself was the rightful heir, so\r\nArthur had to turn his arms against his own people. It was at Camelford,\r\nnear the north coast of Cornwall, that he fought his last fight; he was\r\nwounded to the death, for his skull was, as we shall see, pierced with\r\nten wounds. Then, after the episode of the flinging away of the sword\r\nExcalibur, when Sir Bedivere saw “the water, wap, and waves waun,” a\r\nbarge hoved to the bank; in it were ladies with black hoods, and one was\r\nMorgan la Fay, King Arthur’s sister. Then the barge floated to the\r\nshores of Gladerhaf, and there, to the vale of Avilion,[4] they took him\r\nto heal him of his grievous wound. And so men said that Arthur was not\r\ndead, but by the will of our Lord Jesus Christ was in another place; and\r\nmen say that he will come again. I will not say that it shall be so, but\r\nrather I will say, that here in this world he changed his life. But many\r\nmen say that there is written upon his tomb this verse:--\r\n\r\n    “Hic jacet Arthurus rex quondam, rexque futurus.”\r\n\r\nAnd thus leave we him here, and Sir Bedivere with the hermit that\r\ndwelled in a chapel beside Glastonbury.[5]\r\n\r\n(_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInquisition of the Honour of Wallingford.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1212 AN. 13 JOHN.[6]\r\n\r\nBY M.

ROUND, M.A.\r\n\r\n_PART III_\r\n\r\n(_Continued from Vol. V. page 287._)\r\n\r\n\r\nBEFORE tracing the working of this process in the similar case of\r\n_ceaster_, it may be as well to dispose etymologically of _port_. I have\r\navowedly restricted myself, in this paper, to _port_ as it occurs in\r\n“port-reeve.” But Professor Skeat, in his “Etymological Dictionary” (p.\r\n457), while wholly ignoring, it would seem, its meaning in this and the\r\nsimilar compounds, assigns to the Anglo-Saxon “port,” not merely the\r\nderivation direct from port_us_, but an identity of meaning with that\r\nword. And in support of that meaning, “a harbour, haven,” he aptly\r\nadduces Alfred’s translation of Bede, in which “to tham porte” means “to\r\nthe haven.” Here, however, it might perhaps be urged that Alfred was\r\ninfluenced in his choice of the term by the “portus” in the original\r\nbefore him. It need not follow that when not so influenced, he would\r\nhave spoken of a haven as a “port.” Moreover, it is possible, and indeed\r\nprobable, that the original sense of “port” was replaced by that\r\nnarrower one of a “haven” or “sea-port,” which it had certainly come to\r\nbear by Middle English days, in consequence of that recurrence to Latin\r\nmodels, in which Alfred had himself led the way, and which would lead to\r\nwhat might almost be termed a re-introduction of the word into the\r\nlanguage, fresh from the Latin itself.\r\n\r\nBut again, Alfred might have been influenced in his style by the\r\nWelshman, “Asser, my bishop.”[9] For though the Welsh, as I have said,\r\nadopted “portman” in the sense of a “trader” from the A. S., they had in\r\ntheir own word _porth_ the equivalent at once of _porta_ and _portus_.\r\nOf its use in the former sense we have an illustration, as Mr. Barnes\r\nhas pointed out (Arch. Jour. xxii. 232), in the Welsh version of Matthew\r\nvii. 13:--“ehang yw’r _porth_, a llydan yw’r fford,” (“wide is the\r\n_gate_, and broad is the way “), where in the A. S. version the word\r\nused is _geat_. Its use in the latter is familiar.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to a consideration of such terms as the “Westport” and\r\n“East-port” of Wareham, and the “Newport Gate” of Lincoln. The survival,\r\nat Wareham, of “port” in the sense of gate, is ingeniously attributed by\r\nthe above writer to a direct derivation from the Welsh _porth_, rather\r\nthan from the Latin _porta_. At Lincoln, on testing Mr. Freeman’s\r\nstatement that the gate was actually known simply as “The New Port”\r\n(Norm. Conq. iv. 212), I can find no evidence whatever for it.[10] If,\r\ntherefore, as seems to be the case, “Newport _Gate_” has always been its\r\nname, within historic times, the inference is surely not that which has\r\nbeen drawn by Mr. Freeman in his paper on Lincoln,[11] but rather that\r\nthe “barbarian” conquerors, ignoring the meaning of the “port”\r\n(_porta_), spoke of the Roman “porta” by their own word “geat,”\r\ndistinguishing it from the other gates by the prefix “Newport,” and thus\r\nproducing the, at first sight, unmeaning pleonasm, “New_port Gate_,”\r\njust as Thorn_ey Island_, Mers_ea Island_, &c., are pleonasms formed by\r\nthe addition of “Island,” when the _ea_ or _ey_ (“Island”) no longer\r\npossesses a meaning.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that the Latin _porta_ failed to pass direct into our\r\nlanguage in the form of _port_ (“a gate”). It was, indeed, as Professor\r\nSkeat has shown, imported at a much later period, but then only through\r\nthe French _porte_, and not direct from the Latin. But it could not,\r\neven so, succeed in establishing its position in the language. Found not\r\nunfrequently in the Elizabethan age, both in poetry and in classical\r\nprose, it lingered on, as a classical affectation, even so late as the\r\nCivil War, when we find it used of a city-gate, in a military sense, by\r\nsuch writers as Sprigge and Carter. A sure proof of its disuse is\r\nafforded shortly after this by the substitution of “port _hole_” for\r\n“port,” a pleonasm which, like those above quoted, implies that the\r\noriginal word no longer retained its meaning.\r\n\r\n(_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OLD PLAY-BILL--The following is a copy of the first play-bill issued\r\nfrom Drury-lane Theatre: “By His Majesty’s Company of Comedians, At the\r\nnew Theatre in Drury-lane, This day, being Thursday, April 8th, 1663,\r\nWill be acted, a Comedy called THE HVMOVROVS LIEVTENANT. _The King_, Mr.\r\nWintersel; _Demétrivs_, Mr. Hart; _Selevcvs_, Mr. Bvrt; _Leontivs_,\r\nMajor Mohvn; _Lievtenant_, Mr. Clun; _Celia_, Mrs. Marshall.

I shall give some account of\r\nthem under the several towns wherein they flourished. There were also\r\nmany village Gilds.\r\n\r\n=Boston.=--In this ancient town were various Gilds of great note, but the\r\nmaterials for detailed history have only been preserved in exceptional\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n_Gild of the Blessed Mary._--This appears to have ranked first amongst\r\nthe Boston Gilds, and is believed to have been the _Gilda Mercatoria_ of\r\nBoston, although its constitution in considerable part was\r\necclesiastical. The earliest mention of this Gild appears to be in 1393.\r\nThe Gild itself was probably founded earlier--certainly other Gilds of\r\nearlier date existed in the town. The first Patent was granted to it at\r\nthe date just named. Another Patent is dated in 1445, and a third in\r\n1447. In this last year, Henry VI. granted a licence to “Richard\r\nBenynton and others that they should give to the Aldermen of the Gild of\r\nthe Fraternity of the Blessed Mary of Boston, in the County of Lincoln,\r\nfive messuages, thirty-one acres of land, and ten acres of pasture in\r\nBoston and Skirbeck.” Another Patent grant was issued to this\r\ninstitution in 1483. This Gild had a Chapel, called the Chapel of our\r\nLady, in the Parish Church.\r\n\r\nIn 1510, Pope Julius II. in a “Pardon” granted to the town, provided\r\nthat whatsoever Christian people, of what estate or condition soever,\r\nwhether spirituall or temporall, would aid and support the Chamberlain\r\nor substitute of the aforesaid Gilde, should have five hundred years of\r\npardon!\r\n\r\n_Item_, to all brothers and sisters of the same Gilde was granted free\r\nliberty to eate in the time of Lent, or other fast-days, eggs, milk,\r\nbutter, cheese, and also flesh by the counsell of their ghostly father\r\nand physician, without any scruple of conscience.\r\n\r\n_Item_, that all partakers of the same Gilde, and being supporters\r\nthereof, which once a quarter, or every Friday or Saturday, either in\r\nthe said Chappell or any other Chappell of their devotion, shall say a\r\n_Paternoster_, _Ave Maria_, and _creed_, or shall say or cause to be\r\nsaid masses for souls departed in pains of purgatory, shall not only\r\nhave the full remission due to them which visite the Chappell of Scala\r\nCæli, or of St. John Latern [in Rome]; but also the souls in purgatory\r\nshall enjoy full remission and be released of all their paines.\r\n\r\n_Item_, that all the souls of the brothers and sisters of the said\r\nGilde, also the souls of their fathers and mothers, shall be partakers\r\nof all the prayers, suffrages, alms, fastings, masses and mattens,\r\npilgrimages, and all other good deedes of all the holy Church militant\r\nfor ever.\r\n\r\nThis pardon--and many such pardons, indulgences, grants and relaxations,\r\nwere issued by Popes Nicholas V., Pius II., Sixtus, as well as Julius\r\nII.--was through the request of King Henry VIII., 1526, confirmed by\r\nPope Clement VII.\r\n\r\nIt appears that at the time Pope Julius granted his “Bull” the Gild\r\nmaintained seven priests, twelve ministers, and thirteen beadsmen; and\r\nalso seems to have supported a grammar school. “The seats or stalls\r\n(says Thompson in his “Collections,” &c., 1820) on the south side of the\r\nchancel of the church were no doubt erected for the use of the master\r\nand bretheren of this establishment.” At the dissolution (1538) this\r\ncollege, as it was then called, was valued at £24.\r\n\r\nThe Guildhall of this establishment is yet remaining, and is used by the\r\nCorporation for their corporate and judicial proceedings. Beadsman-lane,\r\nadjoining the Guildhall, was no doubt inhabited by the beadsmen\r\nbelonging to this institution; and the ancient buildings in Spain-lane\r\nwere, it is very probable, the warehouses of the merchants. The\r\npossessions of this Gild were given to the Corporation in 1554, first of\r\nMary.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. Botolph._--It is recorded that in 1349 (23rd Edward III.) a\r\npatent was granted for making a Gild in the town of St. Botolph--the\r\nancient name of Boston. And also that in the same year Gilbert de\r\nElilond gave to the Aldermen, &c., of the Gild of St. Botolph certain\r\nlands and tenements in that town. Another patent in behalf of this\r\ninstitution was granted in 1399.\r\n\r\nIn 1403, Henry IV. granted a licence to Thomas de Friseby and others,\r\nthat they might give to the Aldermen and brethren of the Gild or\r\nfraternity in Boston one messuage, forty acres of land, and twenty acres\r\nof meadow with the appurtenances “which they held of the Lord of\r\nBello-monto for services, &c.” In 1411, the King granted a licence to\r\nRichard Pynchebek and others, that they should give to Richard Lister,\r\nmaster of the Gild or fraternity in the town of St. Botolph, certain\r\nlands, &c.\r\n\r\nIt is not known who founded this Gild; what was the extent of its\r\npossessions; or the particular object of its institution. “It is most\r\nprobable, however (says Thompson), that it was founded by a Company of\r\nmerchants, and that its objects were entirely of a mercantile nature.”\r\nThere is no account of any hall or other buildings belonging to this\r\nGild.\r\n\r\n_Gild of Corpus Christi._--The first mention of this Gild is in 1389,\r\nwhen a patent was issued for the “Guild or Fraternity of Corpus Christi\r\nin St. Botolph.” Another patent was granted in 1392 for an Alderman,\r\n&c., of this Gild; a third grant bears date 1403. King Henry V. granted\r\na licence in 1413 to John Barker, chaplain, and John Wellesby, chaplain,\r\nthat they should give to the Alderman and brothers and sisters of the\r\nGild of Corpus Christi, in the town of St. Botolph, two messuages with\r\ncertain lands, &c., in Boston and Skirbeck. In 1414 another patent was\r\ngranted to this Gild.\r\n\r\nMr. Thompson considers that this was in all probability a religious\r\nGild. At the dissolution it was called a “College,” and its valuation,\r\nas given both by Dugdale and Speed, was £32. The situation of the hall\r\nof this institution was contiguous to Corpus Christi-lane, in Wide\r\nBargate. No remains of any buildings, &c., belonging to it were visible\r\nin 1820.\r\n\r\n_Gild of the Apostles St. Peter and St. Paul._--The earliest record of\r\nthis Gild is in 1393, when a patent was issued “for the Gild or\r\nFraternity of the Apostles St. Peter and St. Paul, in the Church of St.\r\nBotolph in the Town of St. Botolph.” A second grant is dated 1448.\r\n\r\nThis appears to have been a religious establishment, and to have had a\r\nchapel, or at least an altar, in the parish church of St. Botolph. It\r\nwas called a college at the dissolution, and was valued at £10 13s. 4d.\r\nIt is supposed that St. Peter’s-lane, in Wide Bargate, had probably some\r\nconnection with this Gild.\r\n\r\nThe charter of Philip and Mary, dated 1554, vested the possessions of\r\nthis institution in the Corporation.\r\n\r\n_St. George’s Gild._--This was founded prior to 1403, for in that year a\r\npatent grant was issued in confirmation of a licence for the formation\r\nof this fraternity. In 1415 a patent was granted for the keeping or\r\ngoverning of the Gild of St. George in the town of St. Botolph.\r\n\r\nThis appears to have been a trading company, no mention being made of it\r\nat the dissolution.\r\n\r\nThe hall of this Gild was standing in 1726 at the bottom of St.\r\nGeorge’s-lane, on the west side of the river.\r\n\r\n_Gild of Holy Trinity._--Patent grants to this fraternity were issued in\r\n1409 and 1411.\r\n\r\nIt appears from documents in the archives of the Corporation of Boston\r\nthat Stephen Clerke, warden and keeper of the fraternity of the Holy\r\nTrinity, in the town of St. Botolph, together with the brethren and\r\nsisters thereof, did surrender to Nicholas Robertison, mayor, and the\r\nother burgesses of the _new_ borough of Boston, all the estates,\r\neffects, and property of the said fraternity whatsoever, by deed under\r\nthe common seal of their Gild, dated 22nd of July, in the 37th of Henry\r\nVIII. (1546). This surrender was formally made in a house then called\r\nthe Trinity Chamber, which was most probably the hall or Gild of the\r\nfraternity. Its site is unknown. The possessions of this Gild were\r\nconfirmed to the Corporation by Philip and Mary A.D. 1554; as were those\r\nof the St. Mary, St. Peter, and St. Paul Gilds, at the same time, “the\r\nbetter to support the Bridge and Port of Boston.”\r\n\r\nIt is more than probable that these Gilds played an important part in\r\nconnection with the great fairs held in this town, but no evidence is at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n_Craft Gilds._--During the sixteenth and early in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, various Craft Gilds were founded in the borough. Of these,\r\nparticular mention is made of the following: 1555, the Company of\r\nCordwainers and Curriers established; 1562, the Tailors’ Company; 1576,\r\nthe Glovers’ Company; 1598, the Smiths’, Farriers’, Braziers’, and\r\nCutlers’ Companies; 1606, the Butchers’ Company established.\r\n\r\nThese Craft Gilds were founded and conducted on the usual model of the\r\nperiod, as may be seen by the constitution of the Cordwainers’ Company.\r\nThis Company was authorised, and its regulations sanctioned by the\r\nMayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of the borough in 1855, the\r\nfollowing being the substance of its regulations:--\r\n\r\nThere should be elected on the Monday before the Feast of St. Martin, by\r\nthe said Company, two wardens, who should choose a person as beadle, to\r\nbe attendant on the said wardens.\r\n\r\nThe officers were to be presented before and sworn in by the Mayor for\r\nthe time being, on the feast day of St. Andrew, to serve their\r\nrespective offices for one whole year.\r\n\r\nThe said wardens should have authority over all manner of persons using\r\nthe occupation or mystery of cordwainer in the said borough of Boston.\r\n\r\nThat no person or persons should set up within the said borough as\r\ncordwainers until such time as they could sufficiently cut or make a\r\nboot or shoe, to be adjudged by the said wardens, and were made free by\r\nthe Mayor, Aldermen, &c., of the said borough, upon pain of forfeiting\r\n£3 6s. 8d., to be paid to the use of the Company: or to suffer\r\nimprisonment; this fine or imprisonment to be levied as often as any\r\nperson should attempt the same.\r\n\r\nIf any foreigner, or person who did not serve his apprenticeship in the\r\nsaid borough, should be admitted to his freedom by the Mayor, &c., that\r\nhe shall then pay to the wardens £3 6s. 8d. before he should be admitted\r\na fellow of the said Company.\r\n\r\nThat no fellow of this Company, his journeymen or servants, should work\r\non the Sabbath-day, either in town or country.\r\n\r\nThat the wardens of the said Company should have power once a month at\r\nleast, or oftener if required, to search throughout the whole Company of\r\nCordwainers and Curriers for unlawful wares or leathers.\r\n\r\nThere is no reference here to any powers of searching the stalls at the\r\nfairs for “unlawful wares;” but it is not improbable that such a power\r\nwas exercised by the wardens of these Craft Gilds.\r\n\r\n(_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCollectanea.\r\n\r\n“CLAPHAM CHRONICLE.”--J. M. Kemble edited as a boy at school a little\r\nnewspaper, a sheet of about six inches square, printed by himself from a\r\ndiminutive hand press, and aping the style of the daily journals. I\r\n[_i.e._, C. J. M.] have a file of them still, “Edited by John Mitchell\r\nKemble, printer, No. 1, Desk-row.” (See C. Dickens’ “Life of Charles J.\r\nMatthews,” vol. i. p. 34.)\r\n\r\nCIVIC CONVIVIALITY IN 1759.--Mr. J. H. Round communicates the following:\r\n“The Mayor was also empowered [23 Nov. 1759] to give a grand Banquet at\r\nthe ’Change to the Duke of Grafton and the officers of the Suffolk\r\nmilitia. The Suffolk militia then lay at Leicester, officered by the\r\nfirst characters in that county. It was then considered the most elegant\r\nand costly treat ever given by the corporation, and one the most\r\ninebriating. Mr. Mayor [Nicholas Throsby], at night, was assisted by the\r\nduke downstairs; and the duke soon after was assisted to his carriage by\r\nthe town servants: there not being a soul left in the room capable of\r\naffording help to enfeebled limbs--Field Officers and Aldermen, Captains\r\nand Common Council, were perfectly at rest; all were levelled by the\r\nmighty power of wine.” (Throsby’s “History of Leicester” (1791), p.\r\n162.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews.\r\n\r\n\r\n_History and Description of Corfe Castle._ By THOMAS BOND. E. Stanford.\r\n1884.\r\n\r\nWE have here a book to which we can conscientiously pay a high tribute\r\nof praise. The noble ruins of mediæval castles in which England is so\r\npre-eminently rich have rarely found competent historians, for the\r\nreason that while, on the one hand, their architecture is a special\r\nstudy, and understood by only a very few, who have made it their own\r\nsubject; on the other hand, those who have thus acquired the necessary\r\ngeneral knowledge are too often lacking in the special local knowledge,\r\nwhich is, in such cases, absolutely essential. Mr. Bond, however, has\r\nunquestionably succeeded in combining these two qualifications. In the\r\npresent work he gives us, in an enlarged and final form, the results of\r\nthose valuable researches on the castle, of which the outline has\r\npreviously appeared in the third edition of Hutchins’ “Dorset,” and in\r\nhis paper read before the Archæological Institute in 1866. The chief\r\npoint which Mr. Bond has throughout sought to establish is the early\r\ndate of the actual keep, which, as he shows, may with good reason be\r\nassigned to the days of the Conqueror. In this last controversy the most\r\nimportant point is the locality of the “Castellum de Warham,” mentioned\r\nin “Domesday.” Mr. Bond identifies it, beyond the shadow of a doubt,\r\nwith Corfe Castle itself. Mr. Freeman’s unfortunate attempt to defend\r\nhis own identification of it with the later and infinitely less\r\nimportant fortress of Wareham Castle is utterly shattered by Mr. Bond’s\r\narguments, though he does not, strangely enough, allude to Mr. Freeman’s\r\ncontention, which will be found under “Wareham,” in his work on “English\r\nTowns and Districts.”\r\n\r\nWe gladly call attention to the valuable searches made by Mr. Bond among\r\noriginal MS. authorities in the Public Records, especially the\r\ninstructive “Fabric Rolls.” The careful excavations which he has been\r\npermitted to make have also led to important results, and, in short, we\r\nhave in his book the fruits of long and patient study on the spot,\r\ncombined with an unsparing and yet critical use of all available sources\r\nof original information.\r\n\r\nWe must not omit to notice the excellent plans and illustrations, with\r\nwhich the volume is liberally adorned, and which, by their great\r\nclearness, are admirably adapted to their purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mediæval Military Architecture in England._ 2 vols. By G. T. CLARK.\r\nWyman. 1884.\r\n\r\nIT is with a feeling of real gratitude that we welcome this noble work.\r\nThe prolonged labours of “Castle Clark” have long been familiar to\r\nantiquaries, and no archæological meeting at any spot that could boast a\r\ncastle has seemed complete without the presence of “the great master of\r\nmilitary architecture,” as Mr. Clark has been justly termed by Professor\r\nFreeman: to whom, by the way, these volumes are dedicated, as having\r\nbeen issued “at his suggestion.” It has long been a matter of natural\r\nregret that the valuable results of Mr. Clark’s researches should have\r\nbeen so widely scattered as to render them, for practical purposes,\r\ninaccessible to the student. In these volumes they have now been\r\ncollected, gathered together from many quarters, such as the\r\n“Transactions” of the national and local Archæological societies, the\r\n_Builder_, and, not least, the scarce volume known as “Old London,” from\r\nwhich Mr. Clark has been allowed to reproduce his important monograph on\r\nthe Tower.\r\n\r\nThe work begins with twelve introductory chapters, of which we may\r\nselect, as of special interest, that on “earthworks of the post-Roman\r\nand English periods,” an obscure subject, on which Mr. Clark has here\r\ncollected much instructive information. Three chapters deal with “the\r\nCastles of England and Wales at the latter part of the twelfth century,”\r\nand we can only regret that a subsequent chapter has not been devoted to\r\nthe period of the Charter (1213-1223), when these fortresses played so\r\nlarge and important a part in the struggle. These chapters are succeeded\r\nby more than one hundred papers on various castles and works, not\r\nconfined to England alone, as could be gathered from the title, but\r\nincluding many in Wales, Borthwick Tower in Scotland, and, beyond the\r\nChannel, the typical strongholds of Arques and Coucy, together with the\r\nfamous Château-Gaillard. The plans and diagrams, so all-essential in a\r\nwork dealing with these subjects, are bestowed with no sparing hand, and\r\nthere are not a few illustrations of a less severe character.\r\n\r\nThe drawback incident to such a work as this is the great area which it\r\nhas to cover. Not only a very wide knowledge of history, but also much\r\nspecial local knowledge is needed to secure a satisfactory result. It\r\nmust be confessed that Mr. Clark has been more successful in the\r\nstructural than in the historical portion of his theme. Nor have his\r\nviews on the former always escaped challenge. His statements as to\r\nPevensey were questioned at the time, and his account of Colchester,\r\nboth of the structure and of its history, has been very gravely\r\nimpugned. It is somewhat strange that, in this case, Mr. Clark has\r\nrepeated, without correction, his statements, as he has inserted, in his\r\naccount of the Tower, the important discovery of two fireplaces on the\r\nsecond stage, since the paper was originally written. We may also note\r\nthat, notwithstanding the admiration which Messrs. Freeman and Clark\r\nprofess for one another, their views are often very contradictory, as,\r\nfor instance, on Norwich Castle, on the character of pre-Conquest keeps,\r\non the earthworks at Lincoln, and on Richard’s Castle.\r\n\r\nBut while it is necessary to sound a note of warning, it is almost\r\nungrateful to criticise a work which will be recognised as indispensable\r\nto every student of English history in the middle ages. Few studies\r\ncould throw more light on the social life of the two centuries\r\nsucceeding the Norman Conquest. When we learn that, of the papers\r\nreprinted in these volumes, that on Caerphilly was originally issued no\r\nless than half a century ago, we may form some idea of the duration of\r\nMr. Clark’s labours, and may congratulate him on being not only the\r\nworthy successor of the painstaking and indefatigable Mr. King, but the\r\ngreatest authority we have ever had on Mediæval Military Architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cowdray: the History of a Great English House._ By Mrs. CHARLES\r\nROUNDELL. Bickers & Son. 1884.\r\n\r\nTHIS handsome quarto volume possesses something more than local\r\ninterest; it is the history of a house which was one of the most\r\ncharacteristic examples of Tudor architecture, and of a family which for\r\nseveral generations was conspicuous in the history of the times. Cowdray\r\nHouse stood close to Midhurst, in West Sussex; but it was burned down\r\ntowards the end of the last century, and little now remains of the once\r\nmagnificent pile but ivy-clad walls. With the mansion perished several\r\ninvaluable historical treasures--among them the sword of William the\r\nConqueror, his coronation robe, and the oft-disputed Roll of Battle\r\nAbbey. The house was full of rare and curious things, and contained a\r\nlarge number of family portraits of the Lords of Cowdray, whose\r\nfortunes were founded by Sir Anthony Browne, the friend and confidant\r\nof Henry VIII., and whose son, on the marriage of Queen Mary with Philip\r\nof Spain, was created Viscount Montague, a title which became extinct on\r\nthe death of the ninth Lord in 1797. According to tradition, it was at\r\nBattle Abbey, where Sir Anthony Browne and his family were established\r\nwithin three months of its surrender to the Crown, that the famous\r\n“curse of Cowdray” was invoked. The story runs that while Sir Anthony\r\nwas holding his first great feast in the Abbots’ Hall, “a monk made his\r\nway through the crowd of guests, and, striding up to the daïs on which\r\nSir Anthony sat, cursed him to his face. He concluded with the words,\r\n‘By fire and water thy line shall come to an end, and it shall perish\r\nout of the land.’” Two hundred and fifty years afterwards the curse was\r\nfulfilled, for Cowdray was burned down, and the eighth Lord Montague and\r\nhis two nephews were all drowned. Misfortune seems to have been the lot\r\nof Lord Montague’s family from the first to the last, and the climax\r\ncame with the burning of Cowdray; the last Viscount was a monk, who\r\nobtained the Papal dispensation to marry and continue the line; but he,\r\ntoo, died childless, and the male line of the Brownes of Cowdray became\r\nextinct. Mrs. Roundell thus describes the present appearance of the\r\nruins of Cowdray: “Above the great gateway the face of the clock still\r\nremains, with its hands still pointing to the hour at which it stopped;\r\nby the door is the old bell, and the original staples which held the\r\ndoors to the gateway. The kitchen still contains the enormous\r\ndripping-pan, five feet long and four feet wide, and the great\r\nmeat-screen and meat-block. Among these relics of old Cowdray are lying\r\na fine mirror-frame, a chandelier, and Lady Montague’s harp, on which\r\nare the words, ‘H. Naderman, à Paris.’”\r\n\r\nIt only remains to add that Mrs. Roundell has treated her subject\r\nexhaustively, but in a plain, unvarnished manner, and that the book is\r\nillustrated with reproductions, by a photographic process, of some old\r\nviews of Cowdray.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Life and Times of William IV._ By PERCY FITZGERALD, M.A., F.S.A.\r\n\r\nTHIS is rather a sample of book-making by a gentleman who can do better\r\nwork, and has done it. The account of King William’s early years is dull\r\nand heavy; and that of the first Reform Bill contains nothing that has\r\nnot been told before. His accounts of Holland House and its “set” (where\r\nhe has had Macaulay to draw upon), and of the French _emigrés_ in London\r\nafter the Revolution of 1830, and of the chief dandies and ladies of\r\nfashion who hung about Lady Blessington, are the most interesting parts\r\nof the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Luther and the Cardinal._ Translated by JULIE SUTTER. 2. _Homes and\r\nHaunts of Luther._ By JOHN STOUGHTON, D.D. 3. _Luther Anecdotes._ By Dr.\r\nMACAULAY. Religious Tract Society. 1883.\r\n\r\nCERTAINLY the enterprising publishers who call themselves the Religious\r\nTract Society were not behindhand in contributing to the Luther Festival\r\nlast year. The story of one of the bravest men in history (let us not\r\nhesitate to call him so) has seldom been more worthily enshrined than in\r\nthe books now lying on our table. The “anecdotes” are an unambitious\r\nattempt to unite in a connected form the various stories told of Luther\r\nat various periods of his life. “Homes and Haunts of Martin Luther” is\r\nevidently written in the true spirit of the loving and faithful\r\nchronicler. We follow the great Reformer from the mines of Eisènach to\r\nthe princely castle of the Wartburg; from the quiet of the Wittenberg\r\nmonastery to the fierce conflict of the Diet of Worms. Everywhere Mr.\r\nStoughton describes the life and doings of his hero with the tender\r\nreverence of an ardent admirer. A noticeable feature of the book is the\r\nelegance of the illustrations, which are artistically drawn and\r\ncarefully engraved. The foregoing treat of the general story of Luther’s\r\nlife; in the work entitled “Luther and the Cardinal,” we have a graphic\r\nhistorical picture of the memorable struggle between the Reformer and\r\none of the greatest of the Papal adherents, Cardinal Albrecht, Elector\r\nand Archbishop of Mainz. It is written almost in the style of an\r\nhistorical novel, except that no imaginary personage or event is\r\nintroduced. Pastor Metschmann thoroughly warms to his task when he\r\ndescribes in the latter part of the book the fierce retribution wreaked\r\nupon the Cardinal by Luther for the judicial murder of poor Hans von\r\nSchömtz, and he is appreciatively and carefully interpreted by his\r\ntranslator.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hanley and the House of Lechmere_, by the late Mr. E. P. SHIRLEY\r\n(Pickering), is a book to which much interest attaches, as the last (and\r\nindeed posthumous) work of one of the most noble and worthy of scholars\r\nand gentlemen. It is partly topographical, as giving an account of the\r\nparish of Hanley Castle; it is also partly architectural, and partly\r\ngenealogical; and in all these three qualifications Mr. Shirley shone\r\npre-eminent. The old seat of the Lechmere family, now known as Severn\r\nEnd, is one of those fine old timbered mansions which are scattered so\r\nthickly up and down the western and north-western counties from\r\nGloucester to Lancaster; and it appears that the mansion must have\r\nranked a century ago high among the houses of its class. Its general\r\nstructure, its tapestries, its pictures, its painted glass, all serve to\r\nshow this. The greater part of the volume is taken up with the diary of\r\nSir Nicholas Les Lechmere, recording the history of the family from the\r\ndays of the first two Edwards down to the reign of William and Mary, in\r\nfact to within a year of his own death in 1701. The entries exhibit to\r\nus the domestic pursuits,--pleasures, as well as the public duties of a\r\nworthy man and upright judge. A manuscript of Dr. Thomas, quoted by\r\nNash, in his “History of Worcestershire,” observes of the Lechmeres:\r\n“This family came out of the Low Countries, served under William the\r\nConqueror, and obtained lands in Hanley, called from them Lechmere’s\r\nPlace, and Lechmere’s Fields. Lech is a branch of the Rhine, which parts\r\nfrom it at Wyke, in the province of Utrecht, and running westward falls\r\ninto the Maes before you come to Rotterdam.” “Some foundation for the\r\nsupposed foreign origin of the name,” remarks Mr. Shirley, “is derived\r\nfrom the fact that all the earlier ancestors of the Lechmeres used the\r\nprefix _de_, which was afterwards dropped; and as, with the exception of\r\n_Lechmere Heath_ in Hertfordshire, there is no place of that name in\r\nEngland, we may, perhaps, conclude that Dr. Thomas’s theory is the right\r\none. There can be no reasonable doubt that the progenitor of the\r\nvenerable House of Lechmere was seated in the parish of Hanley not long\r\nafter the Conquest, and, after all, it may not be impossible that he was\r\nthe Roger who held under Gislebert, at the time of the Domesday survey.”\r\nMr. Shirley’s work, we may add, is illustrated with a view of the\r\nwestern front of Severn End, as it appeared in 1803, taken from a sketch\r\nby the late Sir Edmund Lechmere; whilst the pages of the volume are\r\nenriched with numerous carefully-executed coats of arms of the\r\nLechmeres, and their several impalements through marriage. The arms of\r\nLechmere, _Gules, a fess, and in chief two pelicans vulning themselves,\r\nor_--“may be taken as an early instance of what is called canting\r\nheraldry, _Lech_, in old Breton, meaning love, and _mere_, of course,\r\nmother,--a play upon the name symbolised by the pelican wounding herself\r\nand feeding her young with her blood.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_The History of Newcastle and Gateshead in the 14th and 15th\r\nCenturies._, by Mr. R. WELFORD (Scott, 14, Paternoster-square),\r\nintroduces us to a district which in the course of the present summer\r\nwill be visited by the Archæological Institute of Great Britain; its\r\nappearance, therefore, is well timed. Mr. Welford has brought together\r\nand has arranged with considerable skill a mass of extracts from the\r\nrecords of “the King’s Town of the New Castle upon the Tyne,” founded by\r\na son of the Conqueror; and in his introductory chapter he has given a\r\nsketch of the early growth of the town, with its charters, its commerce,\r\nand its pageants. The only fault that we can find is that this chapter\r\nis far too brief; for we should have been pleased to see more of Mr.\r\nWelford’s own handiwork, and of his comments on the most interesting\r\nmaterials which he has brought together, and which extend from A.D. 1301\r\ndown to the close of A.D. 1500. For a record of local annals the book\r\nstrikes us as coming very nearly up to the standard of perfection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gwilt’s Encyclopædia of Architecture_ (Longmans) is a work so\r\nthoroughly established as an authority that it needs no commendation of\r\nours. If any proof of its value, and the public appreciation of that\r\nvalue be needed, it will be enough to say that it has reached its\r\nseventh edition. Thus, as to the two previous impressions, many\r\namendments have been made, which the progress of time had rendered\r\nnecessary. But for the present edition “The Tables of the English\r\nCathedrals have been compiled; many chapters on public and private\r\nbuildings have been re-written, and new ones have been inserted: the\r\nlist of architects and their principal works has been removed from the\r\nglossary and re-compiled, the list of architectural publications has\r\nbeen enlarged, and formed into a separate list, while the glossary\r\nitself has received numerous additional terms and illustrations,\r\ntogether with such other amendments as appeared desirable.” Though the\r\nwork is styled an “Encyclopædia,” the only portion of it which is\r\nalphabetically arranged is the “Glossary” at the end; the rest of the\r\nbook is really an elaborate history of architecture, from the earliest\r\nperiod of a semi-barbaric age. In it Mr. Gwilt carries his readers\r\nthrough the annals of architecture, Druidical and Celtic, Pelasgic or\r\nCyclopean, Babylonian, Persian, Jewish and Phœnician, Indian,\r\nEgyptian, Chinese, Mexican, Arabian, Moorish, or Saracenic, Grecian,\r\nEtruscan, Roman, Byzantine, and so on to the rise of that Pointed Style\r\nto which the name of Gothic has clung so strongly. He devotes sections\r\nalso to a general view of the Italian, French, German, Spanish,\r\nPortuguese, and Russian styles; and then occupies the bulk of the work\r\nwith the successive styles of architecture which have prevailed in this\r\ncountry, and the Pointed Architecture of France, Italy, Spain, Belgium,\r\nand other continental countries. The second and third parts of the work\r\ntreat in great detail of the theory and the practice of architecture\r\nrespectively: the fourth part concerns mainly the working builder, and\r\nthe land agent. The work is illustrated by woodcuts, giving views,\r\nelevations, and ground-plans of the principal public and private\r\nbuildings both at home and abroad. The short memoir of Mr. Gwilt,\r\nhimself, prefixed to the work, is the record of a man whose name the\r\npresent race of Englishmen would not wish to die.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lincolnshire and the Danes._ By the Rev. G. S. STREATFEILD. Kegan Paul\r\n& Co. 1884.\r\n\r\nTHE Great Fen District and the Danish occupation of this part of our\r\ncountry, together form an interesting episode in English History; and\r\nthis Mr. Streatfeild has undertaken to illustrate. He is not without, at\r\nall events, one great qualification for his task, for he has long been a\r\nresident in the south of Lincolnshire; and besides that he has other\r\nmerits, for he is a man of honest research, and he writes with the pen\r\nof a scholar and a gentleman. Perhaps the best chapter in the volume is\r\nthe third, which treats of the Dane in his English home; though other\r\nreaders will be inclined to bestow equal praise on the chapter on Danish\r\nMythology, and on the influence which has been exerted by it upon our\r\nlanguage and people. It should be added that the book is dedicated to\r\nthe Princess of Wales, who can see almost from her windows at\r\nSandringham the tower of Boston Church, which marks the district on\r\nwhich the Danes of old have left their stamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Historic Sites of Lancashire and Cheshire._ By JAMES CROSTON, Esq.,\r\nF.S.A. Manchester: John Heywood. 1883.\r\n\r\nThe author of this work says, rather grandiloquently, in his preface,\r\nthat, without any pretension to the dignity of history, his aim has been\r\n“to combine with topographical description, personal narrative and local\r\nlegend, and to snatch from Oblivion’s spoils the shadowy fragments of\r\ntradition that have floated down through centuries of time.” Certainly a\r\nworthy and admirable aim, not wanting, despite the writer’s disclaimer,\r\nin ‘dignity.’ He has contrived to clothe his descriptions of persons and\r\nplaces in a mantle of poetical beauty, which renders them exceedingly\r\ncharming to the general reader, as they are also of pre-eminent interest\r\nto the antiquary. One of the chapters, that devoted to Alderley and the\r\nStanleys, will be especially attractive to admirers of perhaps the most\r\nuniversally admired Churchmen of the century. Mr. Croston has wisely\r\nsummarised in a few words the later and best-known part of his history,\r\nand paid most attention to the early years of Arthur Stanley in the\r\npretty home at Alderley.\r\n\r\nWe must give an especial meed of praise to the spirited style in which\r\nthe story of Sir William Brereton, who was such an excellent type of the\r\nhigher class of the Parliamentarian soldier, is told. As the author\r\nremarks, to tell the history of his life is to write the record of the\r\nCivil war in the north-west of England. This he has told impartially and\r\nexcellently, and in a style of narrative which can scarcely be too\r\nhighly commended for its clearness and freedom from inflation. The pages\r\nof the work are enlivened by apt poetical quotations, many of them from\r\nlittle known old English poets, which show that Mr. Croston’s reading\r\nhas been various and extensive. The book should find favour with more\r\nthan local readers; old Moreton Hall, for instance, is one of those\r\n“stately homes of England” in which a national interest is felt; and\r\nnone who love the quaintly venerable, albeit decayed, mansions of our\r\nforefathers, can fail to be grateful to the writer for his graphic and\r\nappreciative chapter on one of the most ancient and interesting of them.\r\n\r\nMoreton Hall[12] is almost peculiar for its wealth of rich carving and\r\nmouldings, from the entrance, with its two side-posts, each carved to\r\nrepresent a soldier bearing a partisan, to the beautiful little chapel,\r\nnow, alas! degraded to the service of a cattle-shed, lumber, storehouse,\r\nand such base uses. In the “long gallery,” which our author compares to\r\nthe banquetting-room at Haddon Hall, are two draped figures of Fate and\r\nFortune, admirably illustrating the difference between two terms\r\nfrequently confounded with each other. Fate bears a sword, with which\r\nshe pierces a globe above her head, and the inscription beneath is: “The\r\nspeare of destinye whose ruler is knowledge;” while opposite to her is\r\nFortune, blindfolded, pointing to her wheel, and her motto is: “The\r\nwheele of Fortune whose rule is ignorance.” This part of the mansion\r\nalso gathers additional interest from the tradition that “Good Queen\r\nBess” condescended to dance in the gallery, while on a visit to Moreton\r\nHall during one of her royal progresses. If this be true, it is very\r\npossible that her visit may have contributed to the decline rather than\r\nto the exaltation of the family; for to have a Tudor sovereign as a\r\nguest was, in those days, much the same kind of undesirable honour as\r\nthe gift of a sacred white elephant from the Burmese king to some\r\nsubject whom he delights to honour--and to ruin. Witness the clean sweep\r\nwhich the royal Dame contrived to make of the riches of Kenilworth, when\r\nLeicester’s Earl paid so dearly for a glance from royal eyes.\r\n\r\n“Between architecture and history there exists a closer connection than\r\nis commonly supposed,” remarks Mr. Croston, and this may almost be\r\ncalled the key-note of his book. When the author stands before a relic\r\nof the past, visions of past chivalry fill his imagination and,\r\nconsequently, his narrative; and he is never happier than when following\r\nthe fortunes of some old knight who lived by his sword.\r\n\r\n    “Those knights are dust, and their good swords rust;\r\n     Their souls are with the saints, we trust,”\r\n\r\nsays Coleridge; let us add that their _names_ cannot be better\r\ncommemorated than by books like the one before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n_English Etchings_, Part 37 (D. Bogue, 3, St. Martin’s-place), contains\r\nthree admirable examples of the etcher’s skill, namely “Dachsunds,” by\r\nMr. A. M. Williams, representing three dogs of the badger-hound species;\r\n“In the Pursuit of Riches,” by Mr. Edwin Buckman, a spirited drawing of\r\na couple of urchins endeavouring to catch a “copper” thrown to them from\r\nthe roof of a passing vehicle; and a “Surrey Lime-Kiln,” by Mr. W.\r\nHolmes May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObituary Memoir.\r\n\r\n    “Emori nolo; sed me esse mortuum nihil æstimo.”--_Epicharmus._\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. WILLIAM BRAGG, F.S.A., died on June 6. His collection of MSS., made\r\nduring his travels, and dispersed not long ago; his collection of\r\ntobacco pipes of all nations, many of which are in the British Museum;\r\nand his almost complete collection of the editions of Cervantes’s works,\r\npresented to the Birmingham Reference Library, bear witness to Mr.\r\nBragge’s archæological and literary tastes.--_Athenæum._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeetings of Learned Societies.\r\n\r\nMETROPOLITAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES.--_May 29_, Mr. H. S. Milman, Director, in the\r\nchair. The Rev. George Ward, F.S.A., exhibited a Saxon coin of St.\r\nEadmund, a gold enamelled ring of the seventeenth century, and several\r\nNuremberg tokens, found in Lincolnshire. Dr. Samuel Birch exhibited the\r\nframework of a _sella prætoria_ of bronze, which had recently been\r\nbrought from Cairo. “The Corporation Maces of the City of Rochester”\r\nformed the subject of a paper by Mr. W. H. St. John Hope. The regalia\r\nexhibited consisted of the great mace, a pair of silver maces, and a\r\nwater bailiff’s silver oar.--_June 12_, Mr. E. Freshfield, LL.D., V.P.,\r\nin the chair. This being a ballot evening, no papers were read.--_June\r\n19_, Dr. C. S. Perceval, Treasurer, in the chair. “Clay Bars and Pottery\r\nfrom Bedfordshire” formed the subject of a paper by Major C. Cooper,\r\nF.S.A., Local Secretary of the Society for Bedfordshire. Dr. E.\r\nFreshfield, V.P., read a paper on “The Palace of the Greek Emperors of\r\nNicæa at Nymphio.” Dr. J. Evans, F.R.S., V.P., exhibited a bronze medal\r\nof Sir Andrew Fountaine as Warden of the Mint. Mr. C. I. Elton, M.P.,\r\nF.S.A., presented to the Society a contemporary corrected MS. of Sir\r\nJohn Eliot’s Speeches, and also a MS. of law notes of Sir J. Fortescue\r\nAland, Solicitor-General in the second year of George I. (1715-16),\r\ncontaining several interesting particulars.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH ARCHÆOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION.--_May 7._ Annual general meeting. The\r\nBishop of St. David’s was elected President for the congress at Tenby,\r\nand for the ensuing year. The officers and almost the whole of the old\r\ncouncil were re-elected. The Hon. Treasurer, Mr. T. Morgan, F.S.A.,\r\nV.P., gave a review of the work of the Association during the past year,\r\nand declared a satisfactory balance-sheet. The members afterwards dined\r\ntogether.--_May 21_, Mr. T. Morgan, F.S.A., Vice-President, in the\r\nchair. Mr. W. Myers, F.S.A., exhibited several objects of antiquarian\r\ninterest lately brought from Egypt. Mr. Cecil Brent, F.S.A., exhibited a\r\ncollection of ancient pottery, mostly from Cyprus, showing many of the\r\nvaried forms of the ceramic ware of that island. Some gold earrings of\r\nGreek date were also among the collection. The Rev. S. M. Mayhew\r\nproduced many articles of interest, especially to collectors of London\r\nantiquities: there being among them a handsome inlaid marquetry box,\r\nonce, probably, the alms-box of the old church of St. Olave,\r\nTooley-street, since it was found close to the site of the present\r\nbuilding, below the surface of the ground. It bears the inscription,\r\n“The gift of R. Makepiece, 1692,” and appeared but little the worse for\r\nits rough usage. A carved bone knife of Roman date and some fine\r\nexamples of glass of the same period were also exhibited. Mr. Loftus\r\nBrock, F.S.A., also exhibited several antiquities found in London, the\r\nmost curious being a spur of great length. Mr. E. Walford read a paper\r\non the ancient city of Luni, in Etruria, being an extract from a letter\r\nwhich he had recently received from La Signora Campion. This paper will\r\nappear _in extenso_ in the ANTIQUARIAN MAGAZINE. Mr. W. de Gray Birch,\r\nF.S.A., read a paper descriptive of a fine stained-glass figure of a\r\nlady in Long Melford Church, Suffolk, which was shown in _fac-simile_ by\r\na drawing by Mr. Watling. The figure is that of Lady Anne Percy, then\r\nwife of Sir Lawrence Rainsforth, and probably the youngest daughter of\r\nHotspur, and not the first or second, as has been believed. The lady’s\r\nthird husband was Sir R. Vaughan. She is represented in a kneeling\r\nposture, clad in a red heraldic robe, on which are the arms of the Dukes\r\nof Brabant and Lucy; while on her ermine-lined mantle are those of\r\nRainsforth and Brokesborne. This is the earliest known portrait of any\r\nmember of the Percy family.--_June 4_, Mr. T. Morgan, F.S.A., in the\r\nchair. The arrangements for the Congress at Tenby were detailed. The\r\nmeeting will commence on September 2, and end on the 11th, the Bishop of\r\nSt. David’s being President. The Rev. S. M. Mayhew exhibited a Roman\r\nmortar of bronze found recently in the City, its silver covering showing\r\nthe marks of intense heat from burning, the silver being fused into\r\ngranules over the surface. A bronze lizard from Palestine, probably a\r\nGnostic emblem, was also described. Mr. Morgan produced some interesting\r\nrelics from Cagliari, Sardinia, recently found there. Mr. Hughes\r\nexhibited a fac-simile of the Charter granted by Richard III. to the Wax\r\nChandlers Company of London, which he has reproduced in colours. Mr. J.\r\nW. Grover read a description of a tumulus still existing in the grounds\r\nof a house in the Cedars-road, Clapham, which is shown on old maps prior\r\nto the district being built over. It is called Mount Nod; but there is\r\nno evidence to show its date. The old house of Sir D. Gordon, where\r\nPepys died, stood close to the spot. A discussion ensued, in which\r\nMessrs. Compton, Kershaw, Brock, and others took part; reference was\r\nmade to the old Huguenot cemetery, Mount Nod, at Wandsworth, being\r\ncalled by the same name, apparently from the field so called extending\r\nthither. The position commands a view over the Thames valley.\r\nExcavations will probably be made. Mr. R. Smith contributed a paper,\r\nread by Mr. W. De Gray Birch, on Old Winchester, in which he showed that\r\nthe so-called Roman Camp is in reality an ancient British oppidum of\r\nconsiderable size. Mr. L. Brock read a paper on a chapel of thirteenth\r\ncentury date, which still exists at Dover, close to the Maison Dieu,\r\nhidden behind the modern houses of Biggin-street, and hitherto\r\nunnoticed. It is used as a blacksmith’s shop. The Rev. Prebendary Scarth\r\nforwarded a paper read by Mr. Birch, on an ancient harpsichord which\r\nformerly belonged to Tasso. It is at Sorrento, and is dated 1564. It is\r\ndecorated with paintings of Apollo and the Muses, and is in fair\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL ARCHÆOLOGICAL INSTITUTE.--_June 5_, Earl Percy, M.P., in the\r\nchair. Miss Farington exhibited a collection of Roman coins, found near\r\nPreston, in Lancashire, and also some curious wall tiles of ancient\r\nChinese manufacture. Mr. J. G. Waller gave an interesting sketch of\r\nmonumental brasses of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the\r\nleading features of which he traced in chronological sequence from the\r\nwell-known examples from Cambridgeshire and Stoke d’Abernon, Surrey, in\r\n1320-30, down to the specimens of elaborate coat-armour which mark the\r\nconclusion of the Wars of the Roses. Mr. J. T. Micklethwaite, F.S.A.,\r\ndescribed certain curious mediæval frescoes, which had been brought to\r\nlight by the late Canon Wickenden, in Pinvin Chapel, near Pershore.\r\nIllustrations of these two papers were hung on the walls. Mr. A. H.\r\nChurch described at considerable length some Roman potters’ marks on\r\nancient pottery, examples of which had been found in the neighbourhood\r\nof Cirencester, in Gloucestershire.\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL SOCIETY OF LITERATURE.--_May 28_, Sir P. de Colquhoun in the\r\nchair. Mr. W. H. Garrett read a paper “On Macbeth,” chiefly with the\r\nview of elucidating the intention of Shakespeare with respect to the\r\ncentral figure of the tragedy. At the outset, Mr. Garrett endeavoured\r\nto fix the year when the play was first acted. After examining the\r\nsource, Holinshed’s “Chronicle,” whence Shakspeare derived his first\r\nidea of the salient characteristics of the real Macbeth, and alluding to\r\nthe introduction by the poet of the account given by the chronicler of\r\nthe assassination of King Duffe, by Donewald, the author of the paper\r\nproceeded to analyse the character of Macbeth as created by the bard,\r\ncontending that the prophecies of the witches had not the effect on the\r\ncharacter and conduct of the Scottish chief which is usually claimed for\r\nthem by commentators. Shakespeare’s text, it was argued, indicates not\r\nonly that ambitious cravings existed in Macbeth before the action of the\r\ntragedy commenced, but that he had even consulted his wife respecting\r\nthe means to be adopted to secure the throne for himself.--_Athenæum._\r\n\r\n\r\nSHORTHAND.--_May 7_, Mr. T. A. Reed, President, in the chair. Mr. M.\r\nLevy read a paper, entitled “Shakespeare and Shorthand,” giving a\r\n_résumé_ of the opinions of Shakespearean students, critics and\r\ncommentators, as to the probability of some of Shakespeare’s plays, and\r\nespecially “Hamlet,” having been published from the notes of shorthand\r\nwriters taken during the performances, thus accounting for the\r\ndiscrepancies between the various early editions of the plays. A long\r\ndiscussion followed.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. PAUL’S ECCLESIOLOGICAL SOCIETY.--_April 22_, Major Heales, F.S.A.,\r\nin the chair. Mr. W. G. F. Phillimore, Q.C., D.C.L., read a paper on\r\n“The History of the Ecclesiastical Courts,” in which he described the\r\norigin and jurisdiction of the various Courts having cognizance of\r\necclesiastical causes, and how they became diverted from their primitive\r\nintention. He concluded by saying that these Courts were established by,\r\nand presided over by, the clergy, for the discipline of the laity,\r\nwhereas now they were presided over by laymen for the discipline of the\r\nclergy.--_April 26._ The members paid a visit to the Priory of St.\r\nDominic, Maitland-road, Haverstock-hill, and to the church of St.\r\nAugustine, Kilburn, under the guidance of the Prior and Vicar and\r\nchurchwarden respectively.--_May 8._ Mr. Somers Clarke, Vice-President,\r\nF.S.A., in the chair. The Rev. W. Sparrow Simpson, D.D., F.S.A., read a\r\npaper on “St. Vedast.” The lecturer dealt with the Saint himself, and\r\nnot the well-known church dedicated to him, and he traced the derivation\r\nof the name, described his miracles, emblems, works, &c., and concluded\r\nwith a few words upon the affix, “_alias_ Foster,” which is associated\r\nwith the church in Foster-lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVINCIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL HISTORICAL AND ARCHÆOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF IRELAND.--The Munster\r\nConference of this Association commenced on Tuesday, May 13, at\r\nKillarney, Mr. Richard Langrishe, V.P., in the chair. The Secretary\r\nhaving read the minutes of the quarterly meeting, and submitted the\r\naudited statement of accounts for 1883, they were signed by the\r\nChairman. In explaining the minutes to those present, he said that they\r\nchiefly had reference to the schedule of the Act of 1883, for the\r\nPreservation of Ancient Monuments. Some of our Irish antiquities were\r\nincluded in it, but not as many as there should be. Kerry was full of\r\nmonuments, which ought to be placed under the Act. Only four or five\r\nmonuments in the south of Ireland were included, but this was far less\r\nthan ought to be. The Society, as would be seen, was making exertions to\r\nhave something done in reference to the matter. It was not generally\r\nknown that this Act for the Preservation of ancient monuments was in\r\nexistence, or greater efforts would be made in connection with it. The\r\nChairman added that members ought to send a list of those monuments in\r\ntheir neighbourhood to the provincial secretaries, in order to have them\r\nplaced under the Act. Mr. Arthur Hill, M.R.I.A.I., read a paper on “The\r\nCathedral of Ardfert, and other remains there.” The President read a\r\npaper dealing with the subject of Bells in Ireland, and including,\r\namongst others, a description of the six bells at St. Andoen’s, Dublin,\r\nwith their inscriptions. Mr. Robert Day exhibited some curious specimens\r\nof stone and bronze implements, three copper celts, and an ancient\r\nsilver pyx in good preservation. A visit was afterwards paid to Muckross\r\nAbbey, Inisfallen, and Aghadoe. On Wednesday the party, headed by the\r\nRev. James Grant (Hon. General Secretary), proceeded to Tralee, whence\r\nexcursions were made to Ardfert, where the ruins of the ancient\r\nchurches, the cathedral, and the Franciscan abbey were duly examined;\r\nand to Barrow, where the great fort on the east side of the island\r\ncalled “Barrowaneanach,” was inspected. Thursday was devoted to an\r\nexamination of Dunloe Gap, and the Ogham Cave, in the demesne of Dunloe\r\nCastle; and on Friday the party visited the caves at Shanavalla,\r\nArbella, near Tralee.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY.--_May 26_, annual meeting, Mr. J. W.\r\nClark, M.A., President, in the chair. The Council and other officers for\r\nthe next year were elected. The annual report announced that the\r\nSociety’s collections had been placed in the new Museum of Archæology,\r\nthat eight meetings and two excursions had taken place during the past\r\nyear, that forty-seven new members had been elected, and that the first\r\nof a series of loan-exhibitions of University and College portraits\r\nunder the auspices of this Society was now on view in the Fitzwilliam\r\nMuseum. Professor Hughes, in speaking of the so-called _Via Devana_\r\nrunning from the end of Wort’s Causeway towards Horseheath, pointed out\r\nthat there was little, if any, evidence of its Roman origin, and\r\ninsisted that it was rather an entrenchment, to be referred to the same\r\nlater age which has given us Offa’s Dyke in the west, and the Devil’s\r\nDyke, and as many other notable earthworks in East Anglia also. The\r\nRoman roads in the neighbourhood of the Castle Hill, too, he remarked,\r\nseemed to converge to Grantchester rather than to Cambridge, and the\r\nRoman pottery found here indicated rubbish-heaps rather than the site of\r\na camp or permanent fortification; and from all available evidence he\r\ndrew the conclusion that the mound and all the earthworks about it are\r\nof Norman origin. Mr. Browne exhibited outline rubbings of two stones\r\nrecently presented to the British Museum by Mr. A. W. Franks, acquired\r\nsome years ago from persons who described them as coming from the city:\r\nalso of the remarkable rune-bearing stone from St. Paul’s Churchyard, in\r\nthe Guildhall Library. Mr. Waldstein made some remarks descriptive of\r\ntwo stones from the Via Appia at Rome, lately given to the Fitzwilliam\r\nMuseum, and also of a red jasper intaglio, from Smyrna, in the\r\npossession of the Rev. S. S. Lewis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAntiquarian News & Notes.\r\n\r\n\r\nA STATUE of Martin Luther has been unveiled at Washington.\r\n\r\nCHESTER CASTLE is no longer to be used as a prison for civil offences.\r\n\r\nTHE Curfew Tower, one of the oldest portions of Windsor Castle, is being\r\nrepaired.\r\n\r\n“THE Diary and Correspondence of Samuel Pepys,” in ten volumes, is\r\npromised in _édition de luxe_ form by Messrs.

It\r\ncontains 2,500,000 volumes. The cabinet of manuscripts includes 92,000\r\nvolumes, as well as 144,000 medals of all periods, both French and\r\nforeign. The engravings comprise over two millions of plates, preserved\r\nin 14,500 vols. and 4,000 portfolios. The more precious volumes,\r\namounting to 80,000, are kept in the reserved gallery. In 1868 24,000\r\nreaders attended the reading-room, and in 1883 the number was 70,000.\r\n\r\nTHE _Times_ records the discovery of a Roman villa at Woolstone, in the\r\nVale of the White Horse, Berkshire, where some fine tesselated pavements\r\nhave been disclosed. Several interments have also been revealed,\r\napparently of the Anglo-Saxon period. The seax or knife dagger is,\r\nstrange to say, still attached to the girdle of two of the bodies,\r\npresumed to be those of Anglo-Saxon ladies. The excavations, which are\r\nclosed to the general public, were inspected on May 23rd by the members\r\nof the Oxford Architectural and Historical Society, and the Newbury\r\nDistrict Field Club.\r\n\r\nTHE following articles, more or less of an antiquarian character, appear\r\namong the contents of the magazines for June: _Art Journal_, “The\r\nWestern Riviera;” _Cornhill_, “Some Literary Recollections;” _Literary\r\nChronicle_, “Researches for MSS. in the Levant,” and “Contents of the\r\nBritish Museum Library;” _Blackwood_, “New Views of Shakespeare’s\r\nSonnets;” _Army and Navy Magazine_, “Pepys as an Official;” _Eastward\r\nHo!_ “Bethnal-green Museum;” _Cassell’s Magazine_, “The Folk-lore of\r\nColours,” and “A Pilgrimage to Holy Island;” _Magazine of Art_, “Raphael\r\nand the Fornarina,” “The Keramics of Fiji,” and “Greek Myths in Greek\r\nArt.”\r\n\r\nA ROMAN family burial-place has been lately discovered during some\r\nexcavations at Lincoln. It contained a large number of urns, with a\r\nfurnace or oven at the eastern end. “Unfortunately for the interests of\r\narchæology,” writes the Rev. Precentor Venables, “the discovery was made\r\njust when the excavators commenced their work, and from their ignorance\r\nof the value of the remains much of interest was destroyed before the\r\nforeman arrived. The whole of the oven had been demolished, only leaving\r\none reddened wall, indicating the action of intense heat, and the\r\nblackened stones of the flue. The burial-place or ‘loculus’ was,\r\nhowever, perfect. It consisted of a stone-chamber, 5 ft. 10 in. in\r\nlength, its breadth varying from 2 ft. ½ in. at the lower end to 3 ft. 1\r\nin. in the middle.”\r\n\r\nCATALOGUES of rare and curious books, all of which contain the names of\r\nworks of antiquarian interest, have reached us from Messrs.

The\r\nlast-named is called the “Dickens’s Catalogue,” and may be regarded as\r\ncomplete a list as possible of the various editions of Dickens’s Works\r\nand “Dickensana.” The complete set, inclusive of works, extra\r\nillustrations, and portraits, is priced at £200; the price for the\r\n“Dickensana,” which is described as “very interesting and scarce,” is\r\nset down at another £60.\r\n\r\nON May 22 was celebrated in London, at Lutterworth, where he died, and\r\nat other places in England, the Quincentenary of Wycliffe, the great\r\nEnglish Reformer. Among the most noticeable features of the\r\ncommemoration was the opening of a Wycliffe Exhibition at the British\r\nMuseum. Contemporary printed books and engravings and commemorative\r\nmedals formed the chief attractions in the Luther celebration last year.\r\nTo illustrate the life and works of his English predecessor the\r\nresources of the manuscripts department have been chiefly drawn upon;\r\nand as Wycliffe’s name, before all others, is identified with the\r\ntranslation of the Bible into English, a great part of the collection\r\ndisplayed in the King’s Library consisted of a fine series of\r\nmanuscripts of the two versions of the Wycliffe translation.\r\n\r\nON Wednesday, May 28, Mr. J. T. Wood, F.S.A., lectured in the Ephesian\r\nGallery of the British Museum on “The Marbles from the Great Temple of\r\nDiana.” The lecturer said it was needless for him to tell the story of\r\nhis finding the temple of the great goddess of the Ephesians. It would\r\ntake too much time, and it had been so often told before that he might\r\ntake for granted that his audience knew all about it; but he might say\r\nthat it was a very difficult thing to accomplish, and that it was six\r\nyears before he succeeded in hitting upon the site. It was found one\r\nmile from the city of Ephesus, among corn fields, on level ground, where\r\nthere was not the slightest sign of any ruins. Having found the site he\r\ndiscovered sufficient of the remains to enable him to make a true\r\nelevation of the temple, but there were some details still missing which\r\nhe hoped would be obtained by further excavations. They had before them\r\na rough diagram from which they would see that it had 100 columns\r\nexternally, each 6 ft. in diameter, and nearly 60 ft. in height. Only a\r\nportion of the superstructure had been found, which was the lower part\r\nunderneath the capitals, some of the lions’ heads, and some of the\r\nenrichment of the cornice. The coloured diagrams were meant to show that\r\nthe whole of the temple was coloured. The remains which they saw before\r\nthem had lost their colour since they were placed in the museum, with\r\nbut few exceptions, but there was one specimen before them in which the\r\ncolour was clearly demonstrated. Several of the coloured diagrams would,\r\nhowever, show the state in which he found the fragments. He should tell\r\nthem that these remains were found between 20 ft. and 24 ft.\r\nunderground, and their being at so great a depth beneath the surface\r\naccounted for the great expense of these excavations, the Government\r\nhaving spent £12,000 upon them during the five years which it took him\r\nto clear out the temple. He need scarcely tell them that the remains\r\nthey now saw were from the last of the three successive temples. He\r\nfound evidence that all the bases were of about the same size, and that\r\nthe same marble was used. There were two stones at the end of the temple\r\nwhich, he believed, belonged to the frieze of the temple, and which were\r\ngot out from the drums of the last temple. One, which was marked H 4, he\r\nbelieved would be proved to be, what he had always thought it was, a\r\nportion of the frieze. Upon it was a representation of Hercules\r\nstruggling with a female figure, and he believed it was Hercules taking\r\nthe girdle of the Queen of the Amazons. The stone was very much hacked\r\nand disfigured. Mr. Fergusson thought that a column had been placed upon\r\nthis; but there were reasons to the architectural mind which precluded\r\nthe idea that this stone could have been part of the pedestal of a\r\ncolumn. There was a second stone which he believed was a portion of the\r\nfrieze of the temple. Upon one side of it was a representation of either\r\nHercules lifting Antæus, or Hercules struggling with Cacus, probably the\r\nlatter. On the other side they had the figure of a stag. These were the\r\nonly stones which he claimed to be portions of the frieze. There was a\r\nthird stone which was found in the aqueduct, and another which might or\r\nmight not have been a fragment of the frieze, but it was at all events a\r\ncorner-stone. All these blocks were supposed to have come from the same\r\nbuilding, but whether they were portions of pedestals, on which columns\r\nhad been placed, as contended by Mr. Fergusson, was a question which\r\nwould probably be decided by further excavations. Alluding to a fragment\r\nof a sculptured column marked H 3, Mr. Wood said the question was\r\nwhether Pliny would have called it a sculptured column if it had been of\r\nthe height of this drum. Some people thought the columns in the diagram\r\ncould not have been sculptured above the height of one drum, but he\r\nbegged to differ from them. Passing on to another fragment of a\r\nsculptured column, the lecturer said he looked upon it as the most\r\nbeautiful of all, and it was a pity it had been so much hacked about.\r\nThis temple was built in the time of Alexander the Great, and when he\r\nvisited Ephesus he wished to have his name inscribed upon it. The\r\nlecturer pointed out other specimens, one being a beautiful stone which\r\nhad formed part of the base of a column, and another in which the\r\ndelicate proportions of the fillet between the flutings were very\r\nnoteworthy. He further remarked upon fragments of roof tiles, lions’\r\nheads, and various fragmentary specimens of Ionic columns. There were\r\nalso some splendid specimens of profiles of base mouldings, a\r\nrepresentation of a medal of Gordianus found on the site, &c. Mr. Wood\r\ngave a continuation of his lecture on Wednesday, June 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAntiquarian Correspondence.\r\n\r\n                      Sin scire labores,\r\n    Quære, age: quærenti pagina nostra patet.\r\n\r\n_All communications must be accompanied by the name and address of the\r\nsender, not necessarily for publication._\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE SENTENCE OF PONTIUS PILATE.”\r\n\r\n(See vol. v. pp. 80, 217.)\r\n\r\nSIR,--This document appeared in English in _Galignani’s Messenger_ of\r\nMarch 23, 1859, copied from the _Herald_ of about that date.

Macready\r\nwhen first in London became acquainted with him, and was fascinated by\r\nhis manners and learning, but was warned against him as a reprobate of\r\nmost dangerous character.

The second Viscount having taken his seat, no difficulty\r\ncould arise so long as there remained male issue of his body; but when\r\nthat became extinct, the special remainder would have to be established\r\nby proof. I speak, of course, of England or Ireland, for, in the\r\nanomalous chaos beyond the Tweed, it is possible to take a remainder for\r\ngranted, as in the Ruthven case, at one’s own sweet will.\r\n\r\nJ. H. ROUND.\r\n\r\n_Brighton._\r\n\r\n\r\nVISCOUNT HAMPDEN’S ANCESTRY.\r\n\r\n(See vol. v. pp. 197, 331.)\r\n\r\nSIR,--If your correspondent “Trombone” will re-peruse my letter on this\r\nsubject, which appears at the first-named reference, he (or she) will\r\nsee that whatever faults there may be of omission, there are none of\r\ncommission, in regard to the families of Trevor and Hampden.\r\n\r\nNothing is certainly said concerning the bequest of the Glynde estates\r\nto the Honourable Richard Trevor, afterwards Bishop of Durham; but it is\r\nprobable that he devised them on his decease to his brother Robert, then\r\nBaron Trevor, afterwards Viscount Hampden of Hampden. On the death of\r\nthe last Viscount in 1824, the extensive estates were divided amongst\r\nco-heirs, from one of whom the present Viscount Hampden of Glynde is\r\ndescended.\r\n\r\nMy first curacy was Bromham, in Bedfordshire, and I have, as the guest\r\nof George, Lord Dynevor, to whose daughters that estate belonged, sat at\r\ndinner under the portraits, in the dining-room at Bromham Hall, of the\r\nLords Trevor and Hampden.\r\n\r\n_Newbourne Rectory, Woodbridge._\r\n\r\nJOHN PICKFORD, M.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS MILTON A PAINTER?\r\n\r\n(See vol. ii. p. 1.)\r\n\r\nSIR,--The following passage from the pen of the greatest critic of\r\nmodern times, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, seems rather to militate against\r\nthe argument in a former number of the ANTIQUARIAN MAGAZINE, that the\r\nportrait of Milton there spoken of might have been painted by the poet\r\nhimself: “It is very remarkable that in no part of his writings does\r\nMilton take any notice of the great painters of Italy, nor, indeed, of\r\npainting as an art, whilst every other page breathes his love and taste\r\nfor music. Yet it is curious that in one passage of the “Paradise Lost”\r\nMilton has certainly copied the fresco of the Creation in the Sistine\r\nChapel at Rome. I mean those lines--\r\n\r\n                          “Now half appeared\r\n    The tawny lion, pawing to get free\r\n    His hinder parts; then springs as broke from bonds,\r\n    And rampant shakes his brinded mane,” &c.;\r\n\r\nan image which the necessities of the painter justified, but which was\r\nwholly unworthy, in my judgment, of the enlarged powers of the poet.\r\nAdam bending over the sleeping Eve in the “Paradise Lost” (book vii.\r\n463), and Delilah approaching Sampson in the “Agonistes” (book v. 8),\r\nare the only two proper pictures I remember in Milton.\r\n\r\nF. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD BELLMEN’S BROADSIDES.\r\n\r\n(See vol. v. p. 221.)\r\n\r\nSIR,--It may be interesting to some of your readers to know that these\r\nquaint poetical productions continued to be issued by the bellmen of the\r\ncity of Hereford down to the year 1835, and perhaps even later.\r\n\r\nI have in my collection of Herefordian matters a series of six of them\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n(1) A copy of verses | for 1811 | Humbly presented to all my worthy\r\nMasters and Mistresses | in the City of Hereford | by James Lingham |\r\nBellman and Crier of the said City. This has a quaint 17th century\r\nwoodcut of the bellman, with bell in right hand, staff and lanthorn in\r\nleft, accompanied by his dog. In background to left a house, with cock\r\ncrowing on roof, to right a church, probably intended to represent St.\r\nPeter’s. The bellman wears a three-cornered hat, a long-skirted coat,\r\nconfined at waist with belt, with a short coat underneath, embroidered\r\ndown the front. Street shown as paved in chequers, as in the engraving\r\nin your ANTIQUARIAN MAGAZINE. W. H. Parker, printer, Hereford.\r\n\r\n(2) Another copy of verses for 1824, by same bellman, with a later\r\nwoodcut of bellman, in cocked hat and cloak with cape, in the act of\r\nproclaiming in the High Town, with view of old town-hall and St. Peter’s\r\nChurch. W. H. & J. Parker, printers, 4, High Town, Hereford.\r\n\r\n(3) A copy of verses for 1826, by Richard Jones, with a woodcut of\r\nbellman, similarly equipped to last, but the town-hall is shown on\r\nlarger scale, and the church does not appear.

LLOYD.\r\n\r\n_Kington, Herefordshire._\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTS AND CHESTERS.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Mr. Round (see vol. v. p. 282) claims “Port as an English word, in\r\nitself distinct from the Latin _porta_ or _portus_;” later on (p. 283),\r\n“Port was in itself essentially an English word;” yet at p. 286 we read,\r\n“The English _borrowed_ it ... after the settlement ... or before the\r\nsettlement.” How can it be generically an English word, yet borrowed\r\nfrom Latin? There is lamentable confusion throughout this paper, truly\r\ndistressing confusion, and the little bits of assertion and argument are\r\nso cut into slices and sandwiched between slips of quotation and\r\nextract, that it is like dissecting a Chinese puzzle to ramify its\r\npurport.\r\n\r\nWe have the words ‘castor,’ ‘port,’ ‘street,’ and ‘wall;’ now, if these\r\nwords were English forms of some Teutonic roots, they will have\r\nanalogues in the allied tongues: where are those analogues?\r\n\r\n(1) Castor, Caster, Caister, Ceaster, Chester, are all from the Latin\r\ncastrum, as muddled by alien tongues; yet, at p. 285, we are told that\r\nthe “English would presumably have only met, not with the Latin castrum,\r\nbut the Welsh caer or kair.” Why so? As a fact, the Welsh forms are not\r\nborrowed from Latin, but come from an independent Celtic root--as I\r\nthink, direct from the Hindu gir, giri, and far older than Latin. We\r\nfind Keir in Dumfriesshire; Cardiff in Glamorganshire; Carhaix,\r\nKersanton, Kervrin, Kerentrec, Plessis-Kaer, all in Brittany; Caerleon\r\nand Caerwent, both famous places in Monmouthshire, pronounced, the\r\nformer, Karleen, the latter, Kerwent, thus showing the affiliation with\r\nArmorican forms.\r\n\r\n(2) Port: note that “port” is the equivalent of hithe or haven; thus we\r\nhave Hythe in Kent, as a substitute for Portus Lemanis; at Oxford, the\r\nPort-meadow adjoins Hythe Bridge, and was evidently the town haven. The\r\nconditions are similar at Gloucester, where certain meadows, inundated\r\nat floods, are called the Portham; adjoining we find Dockham, and\r\nDockham ditch, which is a reduplicated name. The port-walls of Chepstow\r\nare the harbour defences on the land side, it being the port or gate of\r\nWye River. New_port_, Mon., is in succession to Caerleon, the old port\r\nof River Usk. It follows, as a dead certainty, that the modern word port\r\nas used at London, where Port reeve was the precursor of our Lord Mayor,\r\nis in succession to the Latin portus, not introduced as a new English\r\nword, but preserved by Celto-Romans from Latin usage. Let Mr. Round\r\nstudy the course of those old English roadways throughout England, known\r\nas Portways, and called Roman; can the prefix be of English origin if it\r\nmeans “carry,” _i.e._, the portage of merchandise, from the Latin\r\n_portare_, to bear?\r\n\r\n(3-4) Street and wall speak for themselves, and their plain facts will\r\nsurvive any amount of word-twisting.\r\n\r\nA.

An Act of\r\nParliament passed early in the present reign deprived Southwell Minster\r\nof its collegiate character, while another and later Act has made it the\r\nmother church of a new diocese, consisting of the counties of Nottingham\r\nand Derby, which had hitherto belonged to the dioceses of Lincoln and\r\nLichfield respectively. The church of Southwell was despoiled of all its\r\nmonuments and early records during the troubles of the 16th and 17th\r\ncenturies, and the only MS. of any importance that has come down to us\r\nbesides the Statutes of Queen Elizabeth is the “Registrum Album,” or\r\n“White Book of Southwell.” The former are printed both in Dugdale’s\r\n“Monasticon,” and in the appendix to Dickenson’s “History of the\r\nAntiquities of Southwell.” Mr. Dimock, the Editor of the “Magna Vita St.\r\nHugonis,” in the Rolls Series, published some years ago a history of the\r\nfabric of Southwell Minster; and other local histories, one by Shilton,\r\nissued in 1818, and a third by Clarke & Killpack, in 1838, are, as Mr.\r\nLivett tells us, little more than abridgments of Dickenson’s work.\r\nHitherto a general history of the origin and development of the ancient\r\nsecular college, and of the position which it held in the Middle Ages,\r\nseems never to have been taken in hand; and this want Mr. Livett has\r\nendeavoured to meet in the little volume now before us.\r\n\r\nThat Southwell held an important position in the diocese of York before\r\nthe Norman Conquest is certain; but it is difficult to fix a date for\r\nthe foundation of the church. Mr. Livett writes: “Tradition points to\r\nSt. Paulinus as the founder of a church here--the founder alike of York\r\nand Lincoln, the friend and companion of St. Augustine, the great\r\nmissionary of Northumbria under King Edwin, and the first Archbishop of\r\nYork, A.D. 627-633. This tradition rests upon statements to this effect\r\ncontained in certain _private histories_ of the church, which are no\r\nlonger extant. They are quoted, however, by Camden, in his ‘Magna\r\nBritannia,’ which first appeared in 1586, and were probably lost during\r\nthe civil wars of the following century, when most of the church records\r\nwere either destroyed, or, for safety, carried away. They tell us how\r\nSt. Paulinus founded the church at Southwell when he was baptizing the\r\npeople of this district in the Trent; and a careful consideration of the\r\nVenerable Bede’s account of the missionary work of St. Paulinus gives\r\nsupport to the statement. The ecclesiastical historian makes no direct\r\nreference to Southwell, but internal evidence in his account of\r\nPaulinus’ missionary work, more especially the evidence of the\r\nplace-names mentioned, is strong in favour of the view that Paulinus\r\nextended his labours to the close neighbourhood of Southwell.”\r\n\r\nNo part of the present fabric, with the exception of one or two\r\nfragments, dates farther back than the 12th century; but there is\r\nabundant evidence that a stone church of considerable size existed here\r\nat any rate in the previous century. The Norman parts of the church, as\r\nit stands, remarks Mr. Livett, contain unmistakable evidence of an\r\nearlier building. “In the north transept, over the doorway leading to\r\nthe newel by which one ascends the central tower there is a large\r\nsculptured stone which is worked into the building in such a way as to\r\nshow at a glance that it is old material used up again. It is supposed\r\nby good judges to have formed the tympanum of an early Norman doorway.”\r\nThe year 1110 is the date assigned to the nave and transepts. The choir\r\nis of the Early English period (1230-50), and appears to have been built\r\nduring the episcopate of Walter Gray, for in Torre’s “Collectanea,” in\r\nthe library at York, is preserved an indulgence, addressed by Walter\r\nGray to the bishops and archdeacons of his province, “granting a release\r\nof thirty days from penance enjoined to all who, being truly penitent,\r\nshould contribute to the construction of the church of Southwell, since\r\nthe means of the church were insufficient for the consummation of the\r\nfabric a while since begun.” Torre gives 1235 as the date of the\r\nindulgence, but the document itself says, “in the nineteenth year of our\r\nPontificate,” which, according to Drake, would be 1233.\r\n\r\nThe architectural details of the north transept chapel give the chief\r\nclue to its date, 1260. The cloister is somewhat later; but the\r\nchapter-house and its vestibule date from the close of the 13th century,\r\nand the organ-screen from about 1340.\r\n\r\nThe minster, as it now stands, consists of a clerestoried nave, with\r\naisles and north porch, and two massive towers flanking the western\r\nfront, each surmounted by a spire; a lantern tower, with its parapet\r\nadorned with pinnacles, rises from the intersection of the nave,\r\ntransept, and choir; and cloister and chapter-house on the north side of\r\nthe choir. “‘What either Cologne Cathedral, or Ratisbon, or Wiesen\r\nKirche are to Germany; Amiens Cathedral, or the Sainte Chapelle are to\r\nFrance; the Scalegere, in Verona, to Italy, are the choir of Westminster\r\nand the chapter-house at Southwell to England.’ So writes Mr. G. E.\r\nStreet; and assuredly Southwell chapter-house is placed in the foremost\r\nrank of our geometrical buildings. In the refined and natural treatment\r\nof the foliage which adorns it, it anticipated the artistic perfection\r\nof works of many years later date, and is excelled by none. In its more\r\ngeneral features it may be compared with the earlier parts of the\r\ncloisters at Norwich, and with the ruins of the banqueting-hall in the\r\npalace grounds at Wells. It strongly reminds us, too, of its\r\ncontemporary, the chapter-house at Wells; in its octagonal shape it\r\nfollows the plan adopted in almost all the chapter-houses of secular\r\ncommunities. The resemblance to York is still more complete, the date of\r\nwhich is uncertain, but it is the only chapter-house besides Southwell\r\nwhich has no central pillar to support the vault, and the arrangement is\r\nmore striking there on account of its greater size.”\r\n\r\nMr. Livett gives a minute description of the various parts of the\r\nMinster, which we have not space to follow, and his work is illustrated\r\nwith drawings of some of its chief architectural features, one plate of\r\nwhich, by the courtesy of the author, we are enabled to reproduce. This\r\nshows (1) a circular window in the clerestory of the nave; (2) the\r\nancient tympanum in the north transept, mentioned above; and (3) window\r\ntracery removed from the south-west tower. The ancient tympanum here\r\nreferred to, which is in the form of a sculptured stone, now forms the\r\nlintel of the belfry door. “It must at one time have been the tympanum\r\nof an earlier doorway, and a part of it has unfortunately been cut away\r\nto make it fit into its present position. The sculpture embodies a\r\ndouble subject, rudely executed in low relief, the one representing\r\nprobably David rescuing the lamb from the lion, the other very clearly\r\nrepresenting St. Michael encountering the dragon.... The sculpture\r\ncannot be of later date than the middle of the eleventh century, when\r\nthe church seems to have been considerably enlarged, perhaps altogether\r\nrebuilt, and it might be of earlier date still.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Congress Afield.\r\n\r\n\r\n    If you would know of olden days,\r\n      You need not only read or look\r\n      On quaintest type in early book\r\n    Or learn almost forgotten lays.\r\n\r\n    There is a wider field; go forth:\r\n      And ye who seek will surely find\r\n      That which shall ever teach the mind,\r\n    Go east or west, go south or north.\r\n\r\n    The massive mound in days of yore,\r\n      The fortress hill, the castle grey,\r\n      That speaks of strife and danger’s day,\r\n    Which we in quiet know no more.\r\n\r\n    Here you may trace a Roman’s hand,\r\n      Here the rude Saxon work, and there\r\n      How Norman skill did once repair\r\n    The ruined churches of the land.\r\n\r\n    For many a little church can tell\r\n      Of other days.

WARD.\r\n\r\n_PART III._\r\n\r\n(_Continued from Vol. V. p. 293._)\r\n\r\n    “Hunc solem, et stellas et decedentia certis\r\n     Tempora momentis, sunt qui formidine nullâ\r\n     Imbuti spectent.”--HOR., I. Epist. vii. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nNostradamus was of a stature somewhat less than middle-size, rather\r\nthick-set, active and vigorous. He had a broad, open forehead, a\r\nstraight, regular nose, grey eyes, of gentle appearance, but in anger\r\nflashing fire; the general expression was severe, but pleasant, so that\r\nthrough all the seriousness one could discern a benevolent disposition;\r\nhis cheeks were rosy even in extreme age; he had a long thick beard, and\r\nhis health was excellent, all his senses being alert and well-preserved.\r\nHis spirits were good, and he comprehended readily whatever he gave his\r\nattention to. His judgment was penetrating, and his memory remarkably\r\nretentive. He was taciturn by nature, thought much and spoke little, was\r\nrather prompt, sudden, and irascible in temper, but very patient when\r\nhard work had to be encountered. He slept four or five hours only out of\r\nthe twenty-four. He practised freedom of speech himself and commended it\r\nin others. He was cheerful and facetious in conversation, though in\r\njesting a little given to bitterness. He was attached, so says De\r\nChavigny, to the Roman Church, and held fixedly the Catholic faith; out\r\nof its pale there was for him no salvation. Though pursuing a line of\r\nthought entirely his own, he had no sympathy with the Lutheran heretics\r\nof so-called Freethought. He was given to prayer, fasting, and charity.\r\nAs far as outward observance was concerned, he might be classed with the\r\nhighly respectable and decent. Le Pelletier says, “sa fin fut\r\nChrétienne;” but he adds a little further on that his style is very much\r\nmore like that of the Pagan oracles of Greece and Rome than of the\r\ncanonical prophets of Hebrew Inspiration. He remarks that the first\r\nCentury opens with a regular incantation fortified by the most\r\ncelebrated rites of Paganism, so that some suspicion of his orthodoxy\r\nmay well be entertained. Certain it is, for he avows as much in the\r\ndedicatory epistle to Henry II.--which, by the way, the King never\r\nsaw--that it was his custom prudently to veil in obscurity of expression\r\nwhatever was likely to displease his protectors and so to damage his\r\nprivate interest. This is not the way with the heroes of Hebrew\r\nprophecy, Isaiah, Elijah, Samuel, but though it is somewhat cowardly, it\r\nbecomes, when well reckoned up, a sort of sub-assertion of sincerity;\r\nfor why should a man record the unpleasant things at all if he did not\r\nbelieve in them, and desired only to make himself agreeable? If he\r\nbelieved his own utterances he was _consciously_ a prophet: that he\r\nthrew a veil over them, shows only that he declined to suffer martyrdom\r\nfor his convictions. It is quite possible to be a seer, and yet not\r\nheroical, but it is the poorest of criticism not to distinguish between\r\nsuch frailty as this and imposture. Want of grandeur does not imply any\r\n_intention to deceive_. Modern Freethought effectually breaks down upon\r\na point like this, it almost invariably classifies the weak spiritualist\r\nas an impostor. It reasons somewhat thus: “Astrologers are\r\nimpostors--Nostradamus was an astrologer. Prophets and divines, owing to\r\nthe spread of sound knowledge in modern times, are no longer to be\r\nreckoned as inspired, but as impostors; Nostradamus was a prophet and\r\ntherefore an impostor. He arrived in the world a thousand years behind\r\nhis time, and must lie down now under Scientific and Encyclopædic\r\nridicule. At the close of the nineteenth century is it likely we can\r\nallow such claims to be made upon our credulity as the more rational\r\npart of the community refused to admit three hundred years ago?” To all\r\nthis and to all such processes of reasoning, I need merely say that\r\nthere is a credulity of superstition that has been always esteemed as\r\ndegrading to human nature; but there is also a superstition of\r\nincredulity that is quite as debasing to human nature and even more so,\r\nfor it springs from the folly of pride and conceit, and not, as the\r\nother does, from a misplacement of faith.\r\n\r\nBy his second wife he left three sons and three daughters. The eldest\r\nwas Cæsar, to whom he dedicated his first volume of the “Centuries.” Of\r\nthese he wrote twelve in quatrains, and three of them are left\r\nimperfect, the seventh, the eleventh, and twelfth. But he also left some\r\nForecasts written in prose, which Chavigny collected and arranged in\r\ntwelve books. They are said to comprehend the history of France for\r\nabout a century after his death--its wars, troubles, and whispered\r\nintrigues. The book is not mentioned by Brunet, 1839-45, and I do not\r\nfind it in the British Museum; but the National Library is rather\r\nimperfectly supplied with the literature relating to this remarkable\r\nman; no doubt the authorities there look down upon him from the Olympus\r\nof Bloomsbury with a scientific disregard, as being a sort of gipsy\r\nfortune-teller of the sixteenth century, not worth completing. Do we\r\nexpect a Messiah from that quarter? Can there any good thing come out of\r\nAix in Provence? “Loco exiguo, obscuro, ignobili, barbaro, impio atque\r\nprophano?”\r\n\r\nThis prose history of a hundred years would be interesting, if only to\r\ncompare with the rhymed “Centuries,” which have a much vaster range, and\r\nare supposed by many to cover all the time from Louis XIV. to the\r\nestablishment of Antichrist.\r\n\r\nJean de Nostradamus, the brother of Michael, was Procureur to the\r\nParliament of Aix, and wrote a work entitled “Les vies des plus célèbres\r\net anciens poëtes provensaux, qui ont floury du tems des contes de\r\nProvence,” Lyon, 1575, a book still sought for, and rather rare. It has\r\nbeen seen above that Cæsar also wrote on the same subject. His work was\r\nentitled “Chronique de l’Histoire de Provence:” in this he introduced\r\nthe lives of the poets, and the book was published in 1614 by his\r\nnephew, Cæsar de Nostradamus.\r\n\r\nThese are almost all the facts of any importance that are recorded in\r\nthe life of Nostradamus. It now remains to us to give some account of\r\nthe most remarkable of his forecasts. They may be pronounced obscure,\r\npartial, useless, or what not, according to the special views and\r\ndisposition of mind in each reader. That they are very curious must be\r\nadmitted by all, and that some of the things foreseen with astounding\r\nparticularity are inexplicable upon any hypothesis of reasoning, other\r\nthan that which admits either a direct revelation in every case, or a\r\ngeneral anticipatory faculty, forming part of the great scheme of the\r\nmental endowment of mankind. Call it divination, second sight,\r\nclairvoyance, magnetic affinity, or what you will. Everyone may in this\r\ndecide, or, if you had rather, guess for himself. I prefer the second\r\nsupposition, and think that there are certain organisations, somewhat\r\nrare and peculiarly wrought, that are endowed by nature with a subtle\r\ntact and anticipatory insight denied to the majorities. I further think\r\nthat such exceptional instances occur more frequently in people of\r\nancient and unmixed race, such as the Celt, the Basque, the Chaldean,\r\nGipsy, and most frequently of all amongst those branches of them that\r\ninhabit mountain-ranges. These I imagine to retain the instincts of the\r\nbirth of man more clearly than the mixed tribes that have busied and\r\neven degraded themselves in the social pursuits of money, power, and\r\nart, and have burnt down their souls to a kind of materialistic slag in\r\nthe furnace of what is called civilisation.\r\n\r\nIf man is a creature born to immortality--and certainly no thought is so\r\ncongenial to largeness and nobleness of heart as this is--I can see no\r\nreason why he should not have some vision given him of the minor things\r\nto happen on this theatre of the earth, which might serve as a sort of\r\nforetaste of that major light which is to clothe him as with a glorious\r\ngarment when he steps forth from this his present condition of earthworm\r\ninto that exalted bodily temple that he shall inhabit to all eternity.\r\nScience so-called is free to teach what it chooses: it may level man to\r\nthe rank of a turnip by its insidious analysis and gradational\r\nprocesses. Its business is with the present, and with all its pretence\r\nof intellect it remains of the material earth, earthy. The future is out\r\nof its ken and reach. But the soul, which is the broad, many-sided\r\nreason of man in concrete, and the, so to speak, spiritually\r\nsubstantialised symbol of it, cannot be shut up to this. Chop logic by\r\nAristotle’s chaff-cutter, whether handled by a Duncan, a Watts, an\r\nAldrich, or a Whately, as you please, yet the soul, defies you with its\r\n_absoluteness_, pushes aside induction and the _contingent_ with it, and\r\nlaughing at your littlenesses and your petty syllogisms, leaps at one\r\nbound into the incommensurable freedom of the future of eternity.\r\n\r\nIt now remains for me to show, not that Nostradamus is a grand type of\r\nthe order of prophets, not that all the Quatrains in all of the twelve\r\nbooks of the “Centuries” are intelligible and of definite purpose, nor\r\nthat everything he uttered and recorded is to be regarded as a prophecy\r\neither fulfilling or fulfilled. (This is not at all what I propose to\r\ndo.) I intend simply to select, without over much attention to\r\nchronology or the sequence of events, such of the quatrains as by\r\nphilological apparatus existing are capable of being translated into\r\nsimple and intelligible language out of the occult prophetic, barbaric,\r\nand almost always pedantic phraseology (or old Franco-Provençal patois,\r\nif you like to call it so) in which it pleased or suited our prophet in\r\nhis _fureur poëtique_[14] to record for us his “nocturnes et\r\nprophétiques supputations” (des astres). In doing this, if one case of\r\nunmistakable prevision can be established, the missing spiritual link is\r\nset up that connects the present with the future.\r\n\r\nChristians generally grow almost rancorous against those who reject\r\n_their_ Scripture miracles, as Hume did, on the ground that the laws of\r\nnature being inviolable miracles become impossible; but a miracle that\r\ncontravenes a law of nature is far more incredible _per se_ than such a\r\nspiritual link as the above. The miracle of bringing a man to life goes,\r\nso to speak, dead against nature and its laws customary. But a forecast,\r\nas such, is little more miraculous than a telescope that focuses and\r\nbrings into range what lies out of the range of the ordinary human eye.\r\nIt is really as feasible a thing to the seer, as for you and me to see\r\nthat a kitten will become a cat nine months later on. He sees by\r\nimagination what you see by reasoning on association in the past. It is\r\ndiscovery by a different faculty, I admit. But if Christian belief\r\naccepts a future state and the immortality of the life (commonly called\r\nthe _soul_) of man, then I say, that the Christian who denies the gift\r\nof prophecy to be inherent in mankind[15] is really as dead to spiritual\r\nlife as if he were a materialistic member of a scientific society of the\r\nnineteenth century, or a Parisian enclycopædist of the eighteenth.\r\n\r\nAgain, if Christianity be a heaven-descended revelation, its foundations\r\nmust be rooted deep in the spiritual world and should be full of\r\ncorrespondences. The material universe is full of them. There the\r\nmeanest particle of dust is link by link connected at last with the\r\ngrandest astral phenomena, and can we suppose that men are all possessed\r\nwith an immortal spirit, and yet at the same time announce that not\r\n_one_ of them has any prescience, any foreknowledge of things coming on\r\nthe earth, no sign rendered from the great unnameable Director, who,\r\nvast and invisible, also dwells in spiritual obscurity, and never gives\r\nan inkling to anyone born of woman that He cares more for an empire with\r\nits myriads of embryo angels (according to the doctrine of the Churches)\r\nthan for an oak tree or a medlar? Yet we are willing to make it a point\r\nof virtue to believe that His only Son died for us, and that a whole\r\nline of prophets from Jacob to Caiaphas harped perpetually and in\r\nsuccession upon the Paganini string of the one great utterance of His\r\nadvent. At the birth of Christ it is untruly said that the oracles\r\nstopped. So, according to the present Christian dogmatising, did the\r\nprophets. Would it not be a thousand times more fraught with hope, if we\r\nhad not basely smothered such beliefs by materialistic science (or\r\nAtheism, for it is closer of kin to the blasphemy of unbelief), could we\r\nhave said there _is_ a spiritual living link of prophecy existing, and\r\nnow and again found amongst us; a correspondency in man with the future;\r\na power in him to forecast it a little, though darkly--as with a dark\r\nlanthorn moving through a dark season--and touching so, through film,\r\nthe future of time as to interlink the whole series into one, and make\r\nto-day, perishing--with its bells, its bustle, and its breathing--into a\r\ncontinuous whole, one with the glories of eternity?\r\n\r\nIt will perhaps be well before proceeding to the Quatrains to meet an\r\nobjection against Nostradamus put forward by the famous Gassendi,[16]\r\nwho received it from Jean-Baptiste Suffren. Gassendi, it seems, was at\r\nSalon in 1638, when Jean-Baptiste Suffren, a judge in that town,\r\ncommunicated to him the horoscope drawn by Nostradamus for his father\r\nAntoine Suffren, and written in our prophet’s _own hand_, giving ten\r\npoints, such as he should have a long curly beard, so bent in age, that\r\nin his 37th year he should be wounded by his half-brothers, and he had\r\nnone, and much more of the same sort, but invariably wrong, till the\r\nhoroscope fixes Suffren’s death in 1618, whereas he died in 1597. Now,\r\nin the first place, Gassendi was of a sceptical turn of mind, so that he\r\nwould be glad to find Nostradamus wrong. Then Nostradamus died in 1566,\r\nand only in 1638, seventy-two years after, do they produce this document\r\nand assert that it is in Nostradamus’s handwriting. We may assume that\r\nthe MS. was eighty years old at least. Gassendi does not profess to know\r\nhis handwriting, but took it to be so on Jean-Baptiste Suffren’s simple\r\nassertion. It is perfectly possible that Suffren had some desire to\r\nridicule an astrologer, and might have invented the whole thing. At any\r\nrate, it is not likely that _every one_ of ten or eleven guesses would\r\nbe precisely the contrary of the fact.[17] One of the clauses ran that\r\nat twenty-five he should cultivate rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry,\r\ntheology, natural science, and the occult philosophy. Jean-Baptiste has\r\nthe effrontery to say that he studied not one of these, but only the\r\nscience of jurisprudence. It is not likely, I say, that Nostradamus\r\nwould guess wrongly in all the sciences, and leave out the only one that\r\nthe man pursued. This looks as if it had been manufactured for the\r\nexpress purpose of bringing the name of Nostradamus into ridicule and\r\ndisrepute. It is quite certain that the late John Varley, the painter,\r\ncould draw some most wonderful horoscopes; a cousin of my father’s, in\r\nwhose family he taught, had seen his forecasts marvellously verified. So\r\ncorrect had he frequently been that at the time she knew him it was with\r\nthe greatest difficulty he could be induced to draw one. It is not\r\nlikely that Nostradamus would fall so absurdly short of John Varley.\r\nGuessing at haphazard would correspond with the facts better than this\r\nupon the mere doctrine of probabilities. Jean-Baptiste in his haste has\r\nproved too much, and Gassendi, like a multitude of incredulous people,\r\nwas quite ready to receive too much of the things for which his mouth\r\nwas open and eager.\r\n\r\n(_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Dead Flemish City.\r\n\r\n_NOTES OF A VISIT TO DAMME._\r\n\r\nBY THE REV. JOSEPH MASKELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few cities in Europe of greater interest for the intelligent\r\ntraveller than Bruges, the “cradle of opulent Flanders,” and the “Venice\r\nof the North.” The student in history, the connoisseur in art, the lover\r\nof antiquity, all find here ample instruction and enjoyment. Even the\r\nsuperficial traveller, hurrying on to more fashionable localities, but\r\n“doing” Bruges _en route_, as the correct thing, finds much to interest\r\nhim in its quaint exteriors, silent canals, and old-world streets, to\r\nsay nothing of its many treasures of pictures, sculptures, wood\r\ncarvings, and other monuments of antiquity, to be seen only by\r\npenetrating into interiors, and looking deeper than the surface. “A\r\ndecayed, dull place, where the grass grows in the streets,” was the\r\nverdict of a fellow-traveller, as the train from Ostend steamed into the\r\nmodern Gothic unfinished station of Bruges on a wet day in last July.\r\nNot so. Bruges is neither decayed nor dull, nor does the “grass grow in\r\nits streets.” Gone is the day in which it could be written of the\r\nturbulent Flemish cities--\r\n\r\n    “Bruges et Gaud, qui toujours, ces bouillonnantes cuves,\r\n     Ecclataient à la fois, ainsi que deux Vesuves;”[18]\r\n\r\nyet Bruges is still full of a steady kind of life and activity; and, as\r\none of its intelligent citizens described it, “ce n’est pas ville morte;\r\nc’est une antiquité vivante,” retaining many tokens of the time when the\r\nproud Jeanne of Navarre, the Queen of Philippe le Bel, passing through\r\nstreets lined with the palaces of its merchant princes, and observing\r\nthe rich clothing of their ladies, cried out, “Je croyais être seule\r\nReine de France; je vois ici cent reines que valent autant de moi.”\r\n\r\nBut my visit was not so much to Bruges as to its neighbour and ancient\r\nseaport, Damme. The former, lying so directly in the way of the English\r\ntraveller to Brussels and Cologne, is fairly well known; the latter is\r\nknown only to a select few. Damme[19], which is now a mere village, with\r\na commune of less than 1,000 inhabitants, was, four centuries ago, a\r\nbusy and prosperous town. It stands on the canal between Bruges and\r\nl’Ecluse, about three miles from the former place. Its full name is\r\nHondts-Damme, _la digue du Chien_, so called from a circumstance that\r\nattended its origin. Anciently it stood at the head of the Zwyn, an arm\r\nof the North Sea; a broad digue extending from Bruges to Cadsand, made\r\nafter a terrible inundation in the twelfth century, kept the waters of\r\nthe Zwyn in their proper channel, and upon this digue Damme was built.\r\nThe place was originally confined to the huts of the workmen from\r\nZealand and Holland employed in the construction of the digue; by\r\ndegrees it grew into a populous trading town, the convenient spot for a\r\nharbour, seaport, and depôt for merchandise. Its name of Honsdamme is\r\nthus explained. During the construction of the digue the workmen for a\r\nlong time could not keep out the sea; as fast as their work proceeded\r\nthe returning tides swept it away, till one of them advised that a great\r\ndog, who mysteriously appeared every day on the scene, without any\r\napparent owner, should be thrown into the water. This done, the sea\r\nbecame calm, a solid foundation was soon secured for the digue, and the\r\nwork rapidly accomplished. Hence the name Hondts-Damme, and the figure\r\nof a dog on the town’s escutcheon. The town dates from the completion of\r\nthe digue in 1168; it grew immediately into influence and prosperity. In\r\n1180 it was important enough to secure from Philip of Alsace, Count of\r\nFlanders, a charter of incorporation as an independent commune, under\r\nthe government of two burgomasters and four echevins. The Zwyn was then\r\na broad and deep gulf, protected from sea storms, and affording safe\r\nanchorage for vessels of all kinds. Even down to the seventeenth\r\ncentury, till the formation of the canal to Ostend, this was the only\r\nchannel of communication between Bruges and the sea. In 1213, a fleet of\r\n1,700 ships, equipped by Philippe Augustus of France for the invasion\r\nof England, entered the harbour. The craven fear of King John, and the\r\nintervention of the Count of Flanders having thwarted the designs of\r\nPhilippe, the latter, in his rage and disappointment, resolved to carry\r\nthe war into Flanders. The fine harbour of Damme, and the wealth of the\r\ntown, excited the wonder of the French, who landed and made themselves\r\nmasters of the place, and of a rich booty. “Les vins de France et\r\nd’Espagne, les bières anglaises, les laines d’Écosse, les soieries\r\nitaliennes et orientales, les toiles, les filés, les attelages de\r\nchariots, les merceries, les épices de toute sorte, les peleteries de\r\nHongrie, l’etain anglais, le cuivre rouge de Pologne”--these were some\r\nof the riches stored in Damme. Intoxicated with their prey, the French\r\nwere easily surprised by an English fleet, under the command of\r\nLongsword, Earl of Salisbury, when 300 of the principal French ships\r\nwere captured, and the rest scattered or destroyed. The captured\r\nvessels, laden to the deck with the rich booty, sailed with the\r\nconquerors to carry the joyful news to England. At the same time a\r\nFlemish army from the land side attacked the town, but without success.\r\nThe French King, in revenge, set fire to the houses, and Damme was\r\nnearly destroyed. It was, however, quickly rebuilt, and recovered its\r\nprosperity. In 1240 it was admitted into the Hanseatic League, and the\r\nLombards established banks here. Next year it received fresh privileges\r\nfrom Count John of Constantinople, and the extension of the canal to\r\nGhent still further increased its importance. In 1270 its fortifications\r\nwere renewed and enlarged. In 1297, during the brief war between England\r\nand France, and in consequence of the alliance between Edward I. and Guy\r\nde Dampierre, Count of Flanders, Damme was again temporarily in the\r\nhands of the French. A combined army of English and Flemish attempted to\r\nre-take the town: but the allies quarrelled over their respective shares\r\nof the plunder, and Edward, withdrawing his forces to Ghent, left to the\r\nFlemings the honour of success. In 1300 it was again assaulted and\r\ncaptured by the French; but the patriotic Flemings, led by the Brugois,\r\nquickly defeated their enemies and delivered their country. In 1384,\r\nduring a war with the French, arising out of the insurrection of\r\nFlanders against the oppression of its Count, Louis le Mâle, the\r\npowerful walls of Damme withstood the attack of a French army, under\r\nCharles VI. It was garrisoned by only 1,500 of the men of Ghent,\r\ncommanded by the patriotic Francis Ackerman, and for six weeks held out\r\nagainst 80,000 of the enemy. The capture of the town was as remarkable\r\nas its subsequent defence. Having received information that the\r\nGovernor of Damme and his chief officers were absent at Bruges, Ackerman\r\nmarched from Ghent with his little army, scaled the walls by night, and\r\ntook the place without difficulty. In the citadel he found seven ladies\r\nof high degree, who had come to visit the Governor’s wife. Ackerman\r\ninvited them to a banquet, and paid them every mark of courtesy. “I do\r\nnot make war upon women,” he said, “notwithstanding that many of your\r\nnobles have treated the families of the burgesses in a very different\r\nmanner.” After a brave defence, scarcity of drinking water and the\r\nnon-arrival of the English allies, compelled the brave garrison to\r\nreturn under cover of the night to Ghent, which they reached in perfect\r\norder and safety.\r\n\r\nBut another enemy than the French was now silently plotting the\r\ndestruction of Damme. The sea had shown signs of retreating from the\r\nZwyn as early as the fourteenth century, navigation to Sluys became more\r\nand more difficult, and in 1475 the harbour was almost lost in the\r\nsand.[20] Still Damme long retained its outward signs of prosperity. Its\r\n_entrepot_ of wines, founded by Louis de Crescy in 1357, continued till\r\n1565, and its situation rendered it so important as a frontier fortress\r\nand outpost of the Southern Netherlands that possession of it was\r\nfrequently disputed. The dissolution of the Hanseatic League in the\r\nsixteenth century and the partition of the Netherlands by the\r\nconsolidation of the Northern provinces into the Dutch Republic, which\r\nstrengthened the power and developed the commercial importance of\r\nHolland to the prejudice of Belgium, all helped to hasten the decay of\r\nDamme as a commercial town. In 1637 the Dutch occupied the place during\r\nthe war of Holland with Spain arising out of the fruitless treaty\r\nbetween Richelieu and the United Provinces for the partition of the\r\nSpanish Netherlands. By the Treaty of Westphalia it was restored to\r\nFlanders, and the boundaries between the two Netherlands were left\r\nunaltered. In 1706 it was taken by Marlborough without a struggle, for\r\nthe Flemings everywhere welcomed the allies and submitted to the\r\nauthority of the English, although it was not very judiciously\r\nexercised. The Barrier Treaty, signed at Antwerp in 1715, finally\r\nsecured that Damme should be included within the Austrian Netherlands,\r\nbut, except from its situation close to the frontier, the town had now\r\nlost all its importance. Thus the decay of Damme was not less rapid than\r\nits rise, and its fall as remarkable and complete as was its opulence\r\nand greatness. From being a flourishing maritime town it has become only\r\nan inland village. The ancient harbour, where 1,500 ships could ride\r\nsafely at anchor, is now a corn-field; its broad quays, stately\r\nwarehouses, and fortified walls cannot be traced even in outline; its\r\nstreets, once crowded with merchants and their goods, are now deserted:\r\nindeed it is difficult to realise that this slumbering village was ever\r\nawake. _Jam seges est ubi Troja fuit._ But there are not wanting signs\r\nof a departed greatness. The Hotel de Ville still occupies a prominent\r\nposition in the Place, and though much neglected and injudiciously\r\nrestored it is yet an object of beauty. It was founded in 1242, but the\r\npresent building is of the fourteenth century. It is constructed in\r\nwhite stone, rectangular in shape, with small turrets at each corner. A\r\ndouble stair conducts to an elegant porch, much disfigured, but still\r\nquaint and interesting. On entering the building the first room that we\r\nsee to the left is an _estaminet_, quite humble in character. Behind\r\nthis is the Salle de Justice, still used by the communal authorities,\r\nand the remaining room is now a kitchen. On the oaken and cedar roof\r\nthere are carvings of the Blessed Virgin and other saints, King David,\r\nand Van Maerlandt, “the Flemish Chaucer.” There are also some curious\r\nfire-tongs and fire-dogs, an enormous chimney corner, and some faded\r\npictures and inscriptions. The crypt, partly a store-room and partly a\r\nstable, is striking, but very dirty and neglected. In the quaint central\r\ntower there are two ancient bells.\r\n\r\nThe church, dedicated to Notre Dame, is built throughout of grey bricks,\r\nand is a noble monument in ruins. It was begun in 1180, but the chief\r\npart of the present structure belongs to the fourteenth century. The\r\nwork of destruction was begun by the Dutch Calvinists, who set fire to\r\nthe church in 1578; the growing poverty of the town prevented repairs,\r\ntill the transepts and part of the nave were destroyed in 1725. The\r\nwalls of the ruined nave are left standing, leaving the massive and\r\nlofty tower nearly isolated from the main body of the church. The choir\r\nonly is used for service. It is a fine relic, but sadly spoiled by\r\nwhitewash. The west door is in the modern brick wall which shuts in the\r\nchoir, beneath what was once the roof-screen, but now serves as the\r\norgan gallery. The monuments of the dead are few; several matrices of\r\nbrasses remain, and a few modern tombs. A very fine memorial of Jacques\r\nvan Maerlandt, “the father of Flemish poetry,” and a native of Damme,\r\nwas destroyed by an ignorant curé about half a century ago. The poet\r\ndied in 1300, and is buried at the base of the tower. His memorial was\r\nvery curious. He was seated on a chair with an owl by his side, wearing\r\nspectacles and reading from a book supported on an eagle lectern. To\r\natone somewhat for the destruction of the monument there is a poor\r\nstatue of the poet in front of the Hotel de Ville.\r\n\r\nIn this church, in 1429, was celebrated the marriage of Philip le Bon\r\nwith Isabella of Portugal, and on the 9th July, 1468, that of the\r\nunfortunate Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, with Margaret of York,\r\nsister of Edward IV. Her brother brought her hither with a considerable\r\nfleet, and many of the English nobility in her train, from Margate. They\r\nlanded at Sluys, where the Duke met her and went through the ceremony of\r\nbetrothal. The town of Damme received her with many tokens of welcome.\r\nAs she passed through the streets every householder stood at his door\r\ncarrying a blazing torch, and from this town the bride and bridegroom\r\nmade their festive entrance into Bruges on the day following the\r\nwedding.\r\n\r\nThere is still in Damme a small hospital dedicated to St. John, founded\r\nby Margaret of Constantinople in the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nI visited Damme towards the end of July last year. The road lies through\r\nthe town of Bruges, past the Episcopal Seminary, and out of the Porte de\r\nDamme, along the canal, a perfectly straight line, bordered with poplars\r\nand with corn-fields on each side. In scenery of this kind there is a\r\ncertain sense of repose and of general, though not brilliant,\r\nprosperity, but the eye of an artist is needed to extract beauty out of\r\nso many straight lines and such formal regularity. Many of the fields\r\nare planted with colza, which is said to look very gay when in flower.\r\nIt was the annual horse fair of Bruges, and the scene was busy, but it\r\ncould hardly be called picturesque or lively, with the multitude of\r\npeasants accompanied by young colts as “stolid, stubborn, and sturdy” as\r\nthemselves. Harvesting operations were proceeding with the sickle in a\r\nvery leisurely manner, and the mode of tying up the sheaves, till they\r\nlooked as if they were only bundles of straw with the corn cut off the\r\ntop, seemed very primitive. Altogether it was a scene not to be\r\nforgotten. The world here, instead of advancing, seems to have gone back\r\nseveral centuries, and there are fewer signs of progressive civilisation\r\nthan when Bruges was, in fact, the “Venice of the North,” and Damme its\r\nbusy sea-port.\r\n\r\nThe importance of Damme in the middle ages is shown by the fact that the\r\nJudgments or Customs of Oleron, out of which the maritime laws of the\r\nnations of Europe are derived, and which were said to have been brought\r\nby our Richard I. on his return from the Crusades, were generally called\r\n“Le droit maritime de Damme.” But the Flemish laws were merely a\r\ntranslation of the original customs.\r\n\r\nVisitors to Damme should extend their excursion to the cathedral-like\r\nand judiciously restored church of Lisseweghe, with its noble thirteenth\r\ncentury tower. This village is within an easy walk of the watering-place\r\nof Blankenberghe, where once more the modern world may be studied in\r\nsome of its brightest and most amusing aspects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dignity of a Mayor: or, Municipal Insignia of Office.[21]\r\n\r\nBY R. S. FERGUSON, F.S.A., MAYOR OF CARLISLE 1881-2 AND 1882-3.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PART I._\r\n\r\nThose members of the Archæological Institute who attended the Congress\r\nheld at Carlisle in 1882, will recollect that, though the mayor of\r\nCarlisle did not exactly blow his own trumpet, yet he was rarely seen\r\nwithout his trumpeter in immediate attendance. They may possibly,\r\ntherefore, have set down to his credit a disposition to magnify the\r\ndignity of an office to which he, however unworthy, has been a second\r\ntime elected. Indeed, they would not be far wrong; and he must admit\r\nthat his recreations during office took the form of a research into\r\nMUNICIPAL PAGEANTRY AND MUNICIPAL HERALDRY.\r\n\r\nThese are very large subjects indeed, and I cannot now undertake to\r\ngrapple with them. I am glad to say that my valued friend, Mr. Lewellinn\r\nJewitt, has _seisin_ of them both; and that he is preparing for\r\npublication an exhaustive treatise on “The Corporation Plate and\r\nInsignia of Office of all the Cities and Corporate Towns of Great\r\nBritain.”\r\n\r\nI propose merely to gossip a bit about MUNICIPAL INSIGNIA OF OFFICE; to\r\nmake a few remarks as to what they mean, under what authority they are,\r\nor have been assumed; and to bring under your notice a few examples.\r\n\r\nUnder the term MUNICIPAL INSIGNIA I include _Rods_ or _Wands_ of office;\r\n_Maces_, both great and small; _Swords_ of _Honour_ or _State_; _Caps_\r\nof _Estate_ or _Maintenance_; _Chains_ and _Badges_, both of Mayors’ and\r\nof other officials; _Rings_ and _Robes_; _Halberts_, _Horns_, and\r\n_Constables’ Staves_.\r\n\r\n     “Few people,” writes Mr. Llewellinn Jewitt, “have even the most\r\n     remote idea of the amount of artistic wealth, of antiquarian\r\n     treasure, and of historical relics possessed by and lying hidden\r\n     away in the strongholds and chests of the various corporate bodies\r\n     of this kingdom. The corporations ... are rich beyond compare in\r\n     works in the precious metals, in emblems of state and civic\r\n     dignity, in relics of mediæval pageantry, in badges and insignia of\r\n     various offices, and in seals and records of different periods.”\r\n\r\nThe neglect with which these treasures have been treated is astounding.\r\nThe reformed corporations of 1837 despised Municipal Pageantry; many\r\nactually sold their insignia for the best prices they would fetch, as\r\n“relics of the barbarous ages,” to use the words of a mayor of the town\r\nof Maidenhead. Others discarded the use of their insignia, and their\r\nexistence was almost forgotten. A reaction, however, set slowly in. The\r\nGreat Exhibition of 1851 caused some places, Nottingham for one, to\r\nprovide their mayors with chains, in order to attend at the opening.\r\nOther places were induced to buy new, or furbish up old insignia on the\r\noccasions of Royal visits. During the International Exhibition of 1862 a\r\nloan collection, but on a small scale, was formed, to which several\r\ncorporations contributed their maces and other objects.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1874, the Royal Archæological Institute presented to the\r\nmayor of Exeter a chain of office, in commemoration of the Congress held\r\nat Exeter in the previous year. This excited so much interest that the\r\nCouncil of the Institute, in 1875, entertained the idea of holding in\r\nLondon an exhibition of chains of office and other municipal insignia. A\r\ncommittee was formed, and circulars were sent to nearly 600 municipal\r\nbodies, asking for information as to their insignia, and as to the\r\npossibility of their being exhibited in London. About 300 replies were\r\nreceived; but in those about one-half neglected to describe their\r\ninsignia, or contented themselves by saying they were “_old and_ OF NO\r\nVALUE.” In fact, the municipalities still lacked proper education on the\r\nsubject, for some of those that replied in the above terms possess most\r\nvaluable insignia, as also do some that did not answer at all.\r\nDifficulties arose, many municipalities “did not see their way” to the\r\nloan of their insignia, and so the proposed exhibition was, temporarily\r\nas I hope, abandoned. But the attention thus drawn to the subject had\r\ngood results; it awakened an intelligent interest in the treasures\r\npossessed by various corporations, and Mr. Llewellinn Jewitt seems to\r\nhave had less difficulty in getting information than the Institute\r\nfound. In the years 1880, 1881, and 1882, he published in the _Art\r\nJournal_ a series of most interesting and beautifully illustrated\r\narticles, on CORPORATION PLATE AND INSIGNIA OF OFFICE, shortly to be\r\ndeveloped into the book which I have already mentioned.\r\n\r\nNow it must not be supposed that a municipality can of its own free will\r\nadopt any insignia it pleases. On the contrary, the right to use certain\r\ninsignia, such as maces, swords of state, &c., requires to have been\r\nconferred by special charter or royal donation, or else to be based upon\r\nprescription of such duration that a lost special charter or a forgotten\r\nroyal donation may be presumed. Thus at Carlisle, where we possess a\r\ngreat mace, several sergeants’ maces, and a sword of state, our\r\ngoverning charter--of the time of Charles I.--authorises us to have\r\nthree sergeants-at-mace, who are--\r\n\r\n     “To carry and bear maces of gold or silver, and engraved and\r\n     adorned with the sign of the arms of this our Kingdom of England,\r\n     everywhere within the said City of Carlisle, the limits and\r\n     liberties of the same, before the Mayor of the said city for the\r\n     time being.”\r\n\r\nThis was merely the confirmation of an older custom, for we have a set\r\nof sergeants’ maces of older date than this charter, as well as a set of\r\nabout this date. The charter also authorises us to have a sword-bearer,\r\n“Portator gladii nostri coram Mayore,” a bearer of our sword (the King’s\r\nsword) before the Mayor. Thus, we have special authority by charter for\r\nour sword of honour, and our sergeants’ maces, but none of our charters\r\nmention our great mace or authorise us to have an official to bear it.\r\nBut our great mace was given us by Colonel James Graham, Privy Purse to\r\nKing James II., and I presume that no one will now object to our using\r\nit, and to our having an official to carry it. For robes and a chain I\r\nfancy no special authority at all is necessary; they are part of the\r\nidea of a mayor, and he may assume them or not as his corporation or he\r\nplease to do. And, further, he may appear in them outside of his\r\njurisdiction, as at the Mansion House. But his maces and sword (if he\r\nhas one) he cannot with propriety display outside of his jurisdiction,\r\nand I should, as Mayor of Carlisle, resent bitterly the intrusion into\r\nthat ancient city of a strange mayor with mace and sword, even of my\r\nLord Mayor of London, unless he should prove his right from charter to\r\ncarry them in Carlisle. The Templars never allowed the Lord Mayor to\r\nappear in state within their precincts.\r\n\r\nDifferent views have been held as to the origin of the mace. Some have\r\nsupposed that the regal sceptre, the ecclesiastical virgo or verge, and\r\nthe civic mace, all had their origin in the simple emblem of\r\nstraightness and integrity of rule, consisting of a plain slender rod\r\nanciently borne before kings and high public functionaries, and retained\r\nto the present day as an official badge by sheriffs and attendants in\r\ncourts of justice. The other, and I venture to think the better idea, is\r\nthat the civic mace is derived from the military weapon of that name,\r\nwhich itself is derived from a simple club or stick. The civic mace is\r\nnothing but the military one turned upside down. At one end of an early\r\nmace you have the flanged blades of the military weapon, at the other on\r\na small bowl-like head the royal arms, the emblem of authority. In a\r\nmace of later date the military part, the flanges, survive only as a\r\nsmall button, while the bowl, on which are the royal arms, swells, until\r\nthe peaceful end is itself capable of dealing a heavy blow.\r\n\r\nIn support, however, of the rod idea, I may mention that the Mayor of\r\nCarlisle always on state occasions carries a white rod, an ordinary\r\nwhite stick of deal. This is a very ancient custom. A Captain, a\r\nLieutenant, and an Ancient, all of Norwich, who visited Carlisle in\r\n1634, say of that place:--\r\n\r\n     “It makes shifte to maintain a Mayor, distinguished by his white\r\n     staff, and twelve Aldermen his brethren, _sans_ cap of maintenance,\r\n     but their blew bonnets which they are as proud in as our southerne\r\n     citizens in their beavers.”\r\n\r\nThe blue bonnets would be the ordinary head-gear of the local gentry,\r\nand of the Aldermen thus dressed more than one was of knightly rank and\r\nof high degree. The Mayor of Berwick had also a staff, and when James I.\r\ncame to the English throne he sent the Abbot of Holyrood to secure the\r\nallegiance of the Mayor of Berwick, by which town he travelled into\r\nEngland. The Mayor’s staff and the keys of the gates were delivered to\r\nthe Abbot, and immediately returned to the Mayor.\r\n\r\nAt Newark the Mayor carries a black rod with a gold head. At Marazion\r\nand at Wigan he carries a staff with a silver head; at Guildford ebony\r\nwith silver top. Other instances probably exist, while various\r\nbailiffs’, head boroughs’, and other staffs are only varieties of the\r\nsame idea. In the City of London this staff is represented by the Lord\r\nMayor’s jewelled sceptre.\r\n\r\nThe mace with the royal arms thereon (and no civic mace is a proper\r\ncivic mace unless it has the royal arms thereon) is the symbol of the\r\npower of the central government in municipal matters, and when borne\r\nbefore the mayor denotes that to him and to his colleagues is entrusted\r\nthe government of their community. It is, in fact, the symbol of that\r\nwhich all Englishmen are proud of--local self-government.\r\n\r\nThe committee of the Royal Archæological Institute, who indexed the\r\nreturns obtained in 1875, divided maces into two classes, great and\r\nsmall, but the proper and better division is into mayors’ maces and\r\nsergeants’ maces, though the two nearly correspond. I define as a great\r\nmace, or mayor’s mace, one whose _raison d’être_ is to be carried before\r\nthe mayor in procession, and to be displayed beside him in church or in\r\ncourt. The great mace is the insignia of the mayor. The sergeants’ maces\r\nare the insignia of the sergeants-at-mace; these maces are also carried\r\nbefore the mayor, but that is because it is part of the sergeants’ duty\r\nto precede and attend him in civic processions.\r\n\r\nThe maces belonging to sergeants-at-mace are generally small, from six\r\nto eighteen inches long, and the reason of their being of this small\r\nsize comes from the use they were put to. The sergeants-at-mace were the\r\nofficers of the mayor’s court; they served the processes of the court,\r\nwhich were not in the form of written summonses, but were actually\r\ndelivered verbally, and by a sergeant-at-mace, who produced the mace and\r\nshowed it as his authority. For convenience, he carried it in his\r\npocket, and at Carlisle, prior to 1837, the gowns of the\r\nsergeants-at-mace had pockets in them for this purpose. At Scarborough,\r\nthe sergeants-at-mace wore their maces in their official gowns, and at\r\nStafford they carried them in their girdles. Hence convenience\r\nnecessitated that the sergeants’ maces should be of small size; for the\r\nsame reason they are generally without the open crowns, surmounted by\r\norb and cross, which were added to most great maces after the\r\nRestoration. It would be difficult to pocket and unpocket a mace with a\r\ncrowned head. Of course, there are exceptions to all rules. Yarmouth has\r\na mayor’s mace of very small size, but the reason applies: it is called\r\nthe pocket mace, and is intended to be carried in the mayor’s pocket, so\r\nthat he always may have evidence of his authority about him. There was\r\nno such reason for making the other maces of small size; nay, the bigger\r\nthey are, the grander, and the great mace of the City of London is 5 ft.\r\n3 in. long. My own great mace at Carlisle is 4 ft. 2 in., while the\r\nmaces carried by my sergeants are only about 9 in.\r\n\r\nIt is quite certain that a municipality cannot have sergeants-at-mace\r\n(and therefore cannot have their maces) without a special authorisation\r\nby charter. The sergeants-at-mace were originally the peculiar\r\nbody-guard of the king, and the granting permission to a municipality to\r\nhave sergeants-at-mace is a high mark of honour. In the case of old\r\ncorporations, the right to a great mace will originally have been\r\nacquired in the same way, or else by a royal present of a mace, but a\r\ngreat mace has now come to be an essential which every place that has a\r\nmayor can with propriety adopt.\r\n\r\nEven during the Commonwealth much importance was attached to maces; in\r\n1649, Parliament ordered the royal arms to be taken off them, and those\r\nof the Commonwealth substituted. This was not done at Carlisle; but, in\r\n1650, three new maces were bought for the sergeants at a charge of £12.\r\nAfter the Restoration the royal arms were again restored, and the\r\nCarlisle maces were sent to Newcastle to be altered.\r\n\r\n(_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe History of Gilds.\r\n\r\nBY CORNELIUS WALFORD, F.S.S., _Barrister-at-Law_.\r\n\r\n_PART IV._\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.--_The Gilds of Lincolnshire_--(_Continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN.--The Gilds of this ancient ecclesiastical city are of much\r\ninterest: some of them present a combination of the Social and the Craft\r\nGilds.\r\n\r\n_Gild of the Fullers of Lincoln._--“This Gild was founded on the Sunday\r\nbefore the feast of the Apostles Philip and James, A.D. 1297, by all the\r\nbretheren and sisteren of the Fullers in Lincoln.” A wax light to be\r\nburnt before the cross on procession days. Directions as to who shall\r\nwork at certain operations. Half-holidays on Saturdays; and no work on\r\nfestivals. Outsiders may work at the trade on making small payments. A\r\npayment to be made before learning the trade. No thief shall stay in the\r\nGild. On death of any member, bread to be given to the poor. “If any\r\nbrother or sister is going on a pilgrimage to Sts. Peter and Paul\r\n[Rome], if it is a Sunday or other festival day, all the bretheren and\r\nsisteren shall go in company with him outside the city as far as the\r\nQueen’s Cross, and each shall give him a halfpenny or more; and when he\r\ncomes back, if, as before said, it is a Sunday or other festival day,\r\nand he has let them know of his coming, all the bretheren and sisteren\r\nshall meet at the same cross, and go with him to the monastery.” Penalty\r\nfor not keeping Ordinances. Help shall be given to those in want; but\r\nthe money must be repaid before death or after. Lights and offerings on\r\ndeath. There were some new Ordinances added later, viz., allowances to\r\nofficers; allowance for collecting moneys. Officers not serving to be\r\nfined. New members to pay to the Dean a penny.\r\n\r\n_Gild of the Tailors of Lincoln_, founded 1328.--A procession shall be\r\nhad every year.

Burials for poor members,\r\n“according to the rank of him who is dead.” Pilgrims to the Holy Land or\r\nto Rome to receive a halfpenny from each member, and processions to be\r\nformed. Services for those dying outside the city. Bequests to be made\r\nto Gild according to means, “v_s._ or xl_d._, or what he will.” Fee to\r\nchaplain. Four general meetings every year.

A dole to be given yearly\r\nby every brother and sister for distribution in charity. Fines for not\r\nserving offices.\r\n\r\n_Gild of the Tylers [Poyntours] of Lincoln_, founded 1346.--New members\r\nto make themselves known to “Graceman,” and pay a quarter of barley,\r\nij_d._ to the ale, and i_d._ to the Dean. Four “soul-candles” shall be\r\nfound and used in services. Feasts and prayers, and ale for the poor.\r\nHelp to the pilgrims. Burials provided. One brother shall not unfairly\r\nmeddle with the craft-work of another. All men of this craft in Lincoln\r\nshall join the Gild.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. Michael on the Hill_, founded on Easter Eve, 1350.--On the\r\ndeath of a brother “soul-candles” shall be burned and the banner of the\r\nGild shall be taken to his house, and borne thence to church. There\r\nshall be a Gild feast. At the end the Ordinances shall be read and\r\nexpounded; and flagons of ale shall be given to the poor. Absentees may\r\nrejoin the Gild on making payments. “And whereas this Gild was founded\r\nby folks of common and middling rank, it is ordained that no one of the\r\nrank of Mayor or Bailiff shall become a brother of the Gild, unless he\r\nis found to be of humble, good, and honest conversation, and is admitted\r\nby the choice and common consent of the bretheren and sisteren of the\r\nGild. And none such shall meddle in any matter, unless specially\r\nsummoned; nor shall such a one take on himself any office in the Gild.\r\nHe shall, on his admission, be sworn before the bretheren and sisteren,\r\nto maintain and keep the Ordinances of the Gild. And no one shall have\r\nany claim to office in this Gild on account of the honour and dignity of\r\nhis personal rank.” Help to poor bretheren shall be daily given, in\r\nturn, by the Gild bretheren.\r\n\r\nThe Ordinances of this Gild were very lengthy; the main features only\r\nare here noticed.\r\n\r\n_Gild of the Resurrection of our Lord_, founded at Easter, 1374.--Every\r\nbrother and sister at entrance shall pay iv_d._ to the ale and 1_d._ to\r\nthe wax; and also every year xiij_d._ by four separate payments in the\r\nyear. Those in arrear to pay a pound of wax. Lights to be kept burning\r\nfrom Good Friday to Easter Sunday. A hearse-frame, with lights, angels,\r\nand banners, shall be put over the body of every dead brother; and other\r\nservices be done.

Holders of loans\r\nto bring them before the “Gracemen” every year. Mass and offerings for\r\nthe dead. At the annual feast the Ordinances to be read. After dinner,\r\ngrace, the Lord’s Prayer, &c., names of all dead bretheren and sisteren\r\nshall be read over, and the _De Profundis_ said for their souls.\r\nPilgrims to Rome, St. James of Galacia, or the Holy Land, to give\r\nnotice, and receive contributions of one halfpenny from each member,\r\nwith escort to city gate. Burials of poor bretheren. Surety for goods of\r\nGild. Punishment to those who rebel against the Gild.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. Benedict_, “founded [date not stated] in honour of God\r\nAlmighty, and of the blessed Virgin Mary, and of our Lord Jhesu Christ,\r\nin the parish of St. Benedict.” As many poor shall be fed as there are\r\nmembers of the Gild. Pilgrims to the Holy Land, St. James’s, or to Rome,\r\nprovided for. Services on deaths within the city, and bread given to the\r\npoor; and services on deaths outside the city. Help to poor bretheren.\r\nAt the feast, when ale is poured out, prayer shall be said, and tankards\r\nof ale shall be given to the poor. New members on entering the Gild to\r\npay 6s. 8d., in two instalments. “Morn-speeches” shall be held; and\r\naccounts then given by all who have any goods of the Gild on loan. On\r\nthe Sunday after the feast another morn-speech to be made. Officers\r\nchosen and not serving to pay fine. Penalty if one member wrongs\r\nanother, and for not coming to meetings.\r\n\r\nThere was also a _Gild of Minstrels and Players_ in this city,\r\nconcerning which we have no exact details.\r\n\r\n=Sleaford.=--This ancient town had a Gild--the Holy Trinity Gild--of great\r\nrenown. The date of its establishment is unknown; but many circumstances\r\npoint to its having been founded soon after the Conquest. It must have\r\nbeen in existence before the commencement of the Patent Rolls in the\r\nreign of King John, or mention of the conveyance of its property to the\r\nbrothers in mortmain would be found, as in the case of Boston and other\r\nGilds. It was a rich Gild, having an income of £80 per annum in 1477,\r\nwhen the mention of it occurs. This would be equivalent to £800 at the\r\npresent day. The Gild was under the management of the principal people\r\nin the place; and was famous for its miracle plays, mysteries, and\r\nsacred shows. Perhaps these were next in repute to those of York. There\r\ndoes not appear to have been anything sufficiently distinctive about\r\nthese to call for detailed note, except as will be immediately stated.\r\n\r\nIn 1837 there was published: “History of the Holy Trinity Guild at\r\nSleaford, with an Account of its Miracle Plays, Religious Mysteries, and\r\nShows, as practised in the Fifteenth Century; and an Introduction\r\ndelineating the changes that have taken place in the Localities of Heath\r\nand Fen, Castle and Mansion, Convent and Hall, within the District about\r\nSleaford since that period. To which is added an Appendix, detailing the\r\nTraditions which still prevail, and a description of the Lincoln\r\nPageants exhibited during the visit of King James to that City. The\r\nwhole illustrated by copious notes, critical, historical, and\r\nexplanatory.” By the Rev. G. Oliver, D.D., M.A.S.E., Vicar of Scopwick,\r\n&c., Lincoln. 8vo., pp. 135.\r\n\r\nThe author refers to the fact (p. 61) that all the public amusements of\r\nthe times were interwoven with religion, and placed under the\r\nsuperintendence of Gilds, by which they were conducted and brought to\r\nperfection. “From the most remote period of time the inhabitants of\r\nSleaford and the vicinity practised under that high sanction the\r\ndiversions which were common to every period of the English monarchy,\r\nfrom the minstrels or joculators in the reign of Athelston, through the\r\nroutine of tournaments, the lord of misrule, church ales, Corpus Christi\r\nplays, and the frolics of the boy-bishop in the ages of chivalry, the\r\nbull and bear baitings, the holk, and the mummeries of Henry VIII. and\r\nElizabeth, down to the bulls and other diversions of the present day.”\r\n\r\nConcerning the “frolics of the boy-bishop,” we may take the following\r\naccount from the same author: “There exists presumptive evidence that\r\nthe ceremony of the Episcopus Puerorum was celebrated at Sleaford;\r\nalthough it was somewhat unusual out of the limits of a cathedral or\r\ncollegiate church; for in digging a grave in Leasingham Churchyard, a\r\ndiminutive coffin stone was found in the year 1826, only 2½ feet long by\r\n12 inches broad. It was prismatic, and adorned with a beautiful cross\r\nfleury in relief; and undoubtedly formed a covering to the sarcophagus\r\nof a boy-bishop, who died during the continuance of his ephemeral\r\nauthority. And in the church of Quarrington, at the east end of the\r\nnorth aisle, is an unusually small chapel not more than four feet\r\nsquare, which one cannot but think was intended for the ministration of\r\nthis juvenile functionary. The solemnity of the episcopus puerorum,\r\nthough it may appear trifling in these days, was conducted with great\r\npomp. A boy was elected on St. Nicholas’s Day, who was remarkable for\r\npersonal beauty, to sustain the high office of a bishop until the 28th\r\nday of the same month. He made a solemn procession to the church,\r\nattended by many other boys, arrayed in priestly habiliments; and there,\r\ndressed in splendid robes, decorated with costly ornaments, and covered\r\nwith his mitre, he presided with all the solemnity of an actual bishop,\r\nduring the performance of divine worship. After which he made a\r\ncollection from house to house, which was boldly demanded as the\r\nbishop’s subsidy; and he is said to have possessed such unlimited power\r\nthat all the prebends which fell vacant during his presidency were at\r\nhis disposal. If he chanced to die in that period he was entitled to all\r\nthe honours of episcopal interment, and a monument was assigned to\r\nconvey the remembrance of his honours to posterity.”\r\n\r\nStrype expresses the opinion that this ceremony was sometimes adopted\r\neven in small parish churches; he does not say whether with or without\r\nGild observances.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed that a _Gild of Minstrels_ existed at Sleaford, but\r\nno evidence of the fact is available.\r\n\r\n=Stamford.=--There is the record of one Gild in this ancient town, viz.:\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. Katherine._--The Ordinances before us bear date 1494; but\r\nthey are only a re-affirmation of those of a much greater antiquity.\r\nThe Gild is to abide for ever. Services to be attended by all the\r\nbretheren on St. Katherine’s Eve and St. Katherine’s Day. All shall meet\r\nin the hall of the Gild, and the Alderman shall ask new-comers as to\r\ntheir willingness; and they shall take oath of fealty to God, Sts. Mary\r\nand Katherine, and the Gild; and shall also swear to pay scot and bear\r\nlot, and to keep the Ordinances of the Gild. They shall be lovingly\r\nreceived, and drink a bout, and so go home. Meetings to be held at 1\r\no’clock on St. Leonard’s Day, or the next Sunday, to deal with the\r\naffairs of the Gild. There shall be a grand dinner in the Gild-hall once\r\na year. After dinner an account to be given by every officer. Officers\r\nchosen and not serving to be fined. Gildmen must be of good repute, and\r\npay vi_s._ and viij_d._ on entering, spread over four years, and\r\nafterwards ij_d._ a year for “Waxshote.” Peals of bells to be rung at\r\nand after prayers for the souls of the dead; and the ringers to have\r\nbread, cheese, and ale. Services and ringings on death of Gildsmen.\r\n\r\nThere were four other Gild-returns from this town. The Gild of St.\r\nMartin has every year a bull; hunts it; sells it; and then feasts. The\r\nold custom was kept up in the eighteenth century. See Strutt’s “Sports\r\nand Pastimes.”\r\n\r\n=Village Gilds.=--There were many Gilds in the villages of this county.\r\nOne example will suffice to show the nature of their regulations.\r\n\r\n_Gild of Kyllyngholm_, founded before 1310.--When a brother or a sister\r\ndies, four bretheren shall offer a penny, and each sister shall give a\r\nhalfpenny loaf. “If a brother or sister is unlucky enough to lose a\r\nbeast worth half a mark, every brother and every sister shall give a\r\nhalfpenny towards getting another beast.” “If the house of any brother\r\nor sister is burnt by mishap, every brother and sister shall give a\r\nhalfpenny towards a new house.” “Moreover, if the house of any brother\r\nor sister is broken into by robbers, and goods carried off worth half a\r\nmark, every brother and every sister shall give a halfpenny to help\r\nhim.” If one has a guest, and he cannot buy ale, he shall have a gallon\r\nof the Gild’s best brewing. But the Gild will not allow any tricks in\r\nthis direction. Whoever is chosen Provost must serve, or must pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fountaine Collection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE months of June and July saw the dispersal, by Messrs. Christie, of\r\nthe celebrated collection of art treasures formed by Sir Andrew\r\nFountaine in the early part of the last century, and added to by his\r\ndescendant, Mr. Andrew Fountaine, who died in 1873. In connection with\r\nthis dispersion, a step was taken which is perhaps without precedent in\r\nthe history of English art sales. A number of amateurs, joined by a few\r\ndealers, had subscribed to a guarantee fund, out of which many purchases\r\nwere made. The object of this proceeding was chiefly to allow some of\r\nthe most precious objects to pass eventually into our public museums. It\r\nwould, indeed, be lamentable if nothing of what was finest in the\r\nFountaine collection found a resting-place in our national museums. The\r\noccasions are extremely rare on which a Syndicate can be invited to\r\nrelieve our public authorities of the task of speedy decision. There was\r\na warm expression of hearty support whenever it was thought that the\r\nSyndicate had been successful, and the higher the price realised the\r\nlouder was the applause.\r\n\r\nThe first lot which attracted spirited bidding was a magnificent Faenza\r\nplate, with grotesque masks, cupids, trophies of arms, and musical\r\ninstruments, a satyr on the left playing on a pipe, dated 1508. The\r\nfirst bid for this plate, which was only 10¾ in. diameter, was £100.\r\nAfter some spirited bidding it was secured by M. Lowengard, of Paris,\r\nfor £920, amid applause. A Faenza dish, with the entombment of Christ,\r\nfrom Albert Durer, dated 1519, sold for 135 guineas, being bought by Mr.\r\nRobinson, presumedly for the Syndicate. An Urbino plate in a sunk\r\ncentre--two cupids supporting a coat of arms and other figures--by\r\nNicola da Urbino, was sold for 375 guineas; a Faenza dish, with sunk\r\ncentre, surrounded with a wreath of fruit and foliage--subject, a bear\r\nhunt, from a very early Italian print, by an unknown master--210\r\nguineas; a Pesaro lustred dish, £270; another Pesaro lustred dish, 250\r\nguineas; an Urbino dish, 300 guineas; a large dish with sunk centre,\r\nprobably Castel Durante ware, 360 guineas (the Syndicate); an Urbino\r\npilgrim’s bottle, 240 guineas; an Urbino dish, 330 guineas (Mannheim); a\r\ndish, subject the “Last Supper,” 115 guineas; a Faenza dish from the\r\nBernal collection, 620 guineas (Martin); an Urbino oval dish, the centre\r\nsubject the Children of Israel gathering Manna, 240 guineas (Tuck);\r\nanother Urbino oval dish, 240 guineas (Lowengard); an Urbino dish,\r\nMarcus Curtius on a white horse, 307 guineas (Hainauer); a large deep\r\ndish “The Taking of Troy,” 310 guineas (Hainauer); an Urbino ewer,\r\nVenus, Vulcan, and two cupids, 550 guineas. A splendid Urbino dish,\r\nbeautifully painted with the Children of Israel gathering manna, was\r\nsecured by the Syndicate at 1,270 guineas. A pair of Urbino pilgrims’\r\nbottles fetched 450 guineas. 430 guineas was paid for a pair of\r\nsalt-cellars in coloured enamels, and 800 guineas for a Limoges\r\nfountain, 9 inches high. Of the Henri Deux ware, there were but three\r\npieces. The first of these, a small flambeau of architectural design,\r\nand somewhat severe in ornament, was put up at 1,000 guineas, and it\r\neventually fell to the bid of 3,500 guineas. The next piece, a Mortier à\r\nCire, fell for 1,500 guineas, and the last, a small Biberon, formed as a\r\nvase with handles on each side and across the cover, sold for 1,010\r\nguineas. An antique ewer, by Jean Courtois, realised 2,300 guineas; a\r\nlarge deep sunk oval dish, of Limoges work, also attributed to Jean\r\nCourtois, fetched 2,800 guineas; whilst another oval dish, signed with\r\nthe initials of the same artist, was sold for 760 guineas. Some of the\r\nivory carvings realised exceptionally high prices, notably a horn, of\r\nItalian (or more probably French) work, carved most beautifully in\r\ncinque cento style, which fell into the hands of M. Egger for 4,240\r\nguineas. Large sums were also realised for the armour and arms, of which\r\nthere were several fine examples.\r\n\r\nThe greatest lot of the sale, however, was the splendid enamel of\r\nLeonard Limousin, of which much has been said and written in eulogy, and\r\nto witness the sale of which, as the _Times_ remarked, all the world\r\ncame to Christie’s. This is thus described in the catalogue: A large\r\noval dish, with sunk centre. Raphael’s “Supper of the Gods,” in coloured\r\nenamels on a dark-blue ground, is used to introduce the portraits of\r\nHenry II. King of France in the centre, Catherine de Medicis on one side\r\nof him, and Diana of Poictiers, with yellow hair, black cap and feather,\r\non the other side. The portrait of Anne de Montmorency, Constable of\r\nFrance, is introduced as Hercules, the female and Cupid by his side are\r\nprobably his wife and child, the figure to the left in an ermine mantle\r\nmay be the Emperor; in the background are three winged females bringing\r\nfruit, all the other figures are probably portraits, and are finished\r\nwith the care of miniature painting; on the top are the arms of Anne de\r\nMontmorency, with his coronet and order of St. Michael; the border is\r\nsurrounded with boys at play entwined with wreaths of fruit and flowers,\r\nthe back is richly covered with masks, fruit, and flowers, arabesque\r\nfigures in grisaille and scroll-work in gold; signed “Leonard Limousin,\r\n1555. 19¼ in. by 16⅜ in.” The piece is specially described as in this\r\nFountaine collection by Count Laborde in his great work on enamels in\r\nthe Louvre collection. It was put up at 2,000 guineas, and at once the\r\nbiddings went on by 500 up to 5,100 guineas, at which there was a pause\r\namong the four or five bidders, who were, as far as we could observe,\r\nMM. Gauchez, Wertheimer, Coureau, Thibaudeau, and Boore. M. Wertheimer\r\nthen led the contest again, and soon distanced all his competitors with\r\nhis final bid of 7,000 guineas, at which the hammer fell.\r\n\r\nThe sum total realised by the four days’ sale of the miscellaneous\r\narticles was £91,112 17s., a sum which is nearly double that which is\r\nsaid to have been offered for the collection _en bloc_ by the dealers.\r\nIn the great Bernal sale 4,098 lots yielded £62,690 18s.; in this 565\r\nlots gave half as much again. In the Strawberry-hill sale (1842) of\r\ntwenty-four days, only £30,000 was realised, omitting the Cellini Bell\r\nand the Raphael Missal, which were “bought in.” So that George Robins’s\r\ngrandiloquent description of that collection as “the most distinguished\r\ngem that has ever adorned the annals of auctions” must be taken with\r\nsome reserve for the future.\r\n\r\nThe sale of the prints and drawings belonging to the Fountaine\r\ncollection occupied four days. Among the more important lots were Albert\r\nDürer’s “Knight and Death,” 50 guineas (Colnaghi), and the “Judgment of\r\nParis,” £45 (Thibaudeau); “Christ on the Cross, with Saints,” £91\r\n(Meder); “The Incense Burner,” £151 (Meder); “The Virgin,” £46 (Meder);\r\ntwo studies--a female head and an infant Christ--in silver point, £125\r\n(Thibaudeau); a small highly-finished study of woman holding a piece of\r\nlinen, £210 (Salting); two heads of women asleep, in silver point, £180\r\n(Thibaudeau). This portion of the sale realised £5,166 1s., which\r\nswelled the grand total up to £96,278 18s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCollectanea.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER SUPPLY OF LONDON IN THE MIDDLE AGES.--The first enterprising\r\nLondoner who introduced conduit water to his premises was a tradesman of\r\nFleet-street. In a record of 1478, it is mentioned that “a wax-chandler\r\nin Flete-strete had by crafte perced a pipe of the condit withynne the\r\nground, and so conveied the water into his selar: wherefore he was\r\njudged to ride through the citie with a condit uppon his hedde,” and the\r\nCity Crier was to walk before him proclaiming his offence.--_Builder._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _A Story of Stourton and other Wiltshire Tales: told in Verse._ By\r\n     W. G. BENHAM. Simpkin, Marshall & Co.\r\n\r\nTHIS little work is an ingenious attempt to tell in lively verse several\r\npopular Wiltshire traditions of considerable antiquarian interest. The\r\nwriter seems to have taken pains to present the traditions in as\r\naccurate a form as possible, and assures us that “all available\r\nmanuscripts and other authorities have been carefully consulted.” There\r\nis much in the versification to remind us of the “Ingoldsby Legends.”\r\n\r\n     _Histoire de l’Art dans l’Antiquité._ Par GEORGES PERROT, Membre de\r\n     l’Institut, et CHARLES CHIPIEZ, Architecte du Gouvernement. 8vo.\r\n     Vol. II. Chaldée et Assyrie. Paris et Londres: L. Hachette et Cie.\r\n\r\nTHE study of archæology has lately made signal progress in France as\r\nwell as in England. A great many works have been published bearing upon\r\nthe subject, and the volumes issued annually by Messrs. Perrot and\r\nChipiez deserve to be especially mentioned as excellent specimens of\r\nwhat that class of literature ought to be. They are not intended for\r\n_savants_ properly so called, and therefore they do not bristle with\r\nerudite quotations, or hieroglyphic figures and cuneiform texts; neither\r\nare they, on the other hand, elementary manuals or abridgments for the\r\nuse of beginners; the two authors have started their joint undertaking\r\nfor the express purpose of giving a somewhat detailed account of the\r\nprogress of art amongst the different nations of antiquity, calling to\r\ntheir assistance the resources furnished by wood and steel engraving,\r\nchromo-lithography, &c.; and the improvements which during the last\r\nhalf-century have been introduced into the several departments of\r\npictorial illustration have rendered their work, in that respect,\r\ncomparatively easy.\r\n\r\nThe publication we are now reviewing will be terminated in five or six\r\nvolumes. Messrs. Perrot and Chipiez had, last year, introduced us to\r\nEgypt; their second instalment is devoted to Chaldæa and Assyria; it\r\nmarks, therefore, a signal development in æsthetic culture, and in the\r\nvarious expressions of architecture, painting, and sculpture. From the\r\ncivilisation which Messrs. Champollion, Mariette, Maspéro, Young, and de\r\nRougé have unfolded before us, we are now invited to pass on to that\r\nwith which the names of Sir A. Layard, Sir H. Rawlinson, Messrs. Jules\r\nOppert, and Fr. Lenormant have made us tolerably familiar.\r\n\r\nThe first chapter of this volume treats of the general characteristics\r\nof Chaldæo-Assyrian society, and naturally opens with geographical and\r\nethnological details. M. Perrot, we are happy to see, pays a\r\nwell-deserved tribute of praise to Professor Rawlinson’s celebrated\r\nwork, “The Five Great Monarchies of the Ancient Eastern World,” making,\r\nat the same time, long quotations from it, as well as from the\r\nresearches of Sir A. Layard, M. Hormuzd Rassam, &c. Whilst enumerating\r\nthe various elements which have contributed to make up the population of\r\nAssyria and Chaldæa, our author notices the hypothesis recently put\r\nforth by some antiquarians who would number amongst those elements the\r\nAryan one. He maintains that if it did exist it was only in a very small\r\nproportion--so small, indeed, that it is scarcely worth taking it into\r\naccount; on the other hand, if we admit the theories of Messrs. J.\r\nOppert and Fr. Lenormant, we have to register a fact of the most\r\ninteresting and unlooked for nature. It was hitherto believed that we\r\ncould not go beyond the families of Sem and of Kusch, which occupied\r\nChaldæa at the time when history is supposed to commence. From certain\r\ninscriptions, however, it seems perfectly clear that the oldest idiom\r\nspoken, or at any rate written, there, belonged neither to the Aryan nor\r\nto the Semitic families, nor yet to any of the groups of languages which\r\nare considered as including the old Egyptian. It was essentially an\r\nagglutinative idiom, and by its grammatical system, as well as by some\r\nof the elements of its vocabulary, it may be assimilated to the Finnish,\r\nthe Turkish, and other cognate languages. M. Perrot then goes on to\r\ndiscuss the questions connected with writing, religion, and government,\r\nand to describe the form of government which prevailed on the banks of\r\nthe Euphrates and Tigris. The reader will remark that this first chapter\r\nis a kind of introduction to the book; for art, which is the outcome of\r\ncivilisation, cannot be well understood till we are acquainted with the\r\nelements from which it originated. Architecture, sculpture, painting,\r\nand the industrial arts constitute the subjects of the next seven\r\nchapters; and here, again, the eschatological ideas of the\r\nChaldæo-Assyrians give us a clue to the character of the monuments which\r\nthey raised to the dead. When we say raised to the dead we are guilty of\r\na slight error; for all the researches of Sir A. Layard, Messrs. Hormuzd\r\nRassam, de Sarzec, Botta, and Place have failed to bring to light a\r\nsingle _débris_, whether inscription or sculpture, from which we might\r\nknow what the Assyrians believed about the destiny of man after this\r\nlife. In Lower Chaldæa a few monuments have indeed been discovered, but\r\nthey are extremely simple, and the contrast between Egyptian and\r\nChaldæo-Assyrian art in this respect is wonderfully striking. As M.\r\nPerrot remarks, we know a great deal more about the sepulchral rites,\r\nthe tombs and the funereal remains of the Egyptians than about the\r\npalaces of their princes. It is just the reverse in Assyria: “We have\r\nnever seen represented the fall, the death, or the burial of an Assyrian\r\nwarrior; one might almost suppose that a feeling of national pride has\r\nprevented the artist from admitting that an Assyrian warrior could die;\r\nall the corpses we see portrayed on the battlefield are those of\r\nenemies; we recognise them because they are frequently mutilated and\r\ndecapitated.” If, however, Chaldæa has only a few sepulchral monuments\r\nto boast of, it abounds in burial-grounds, and between Niffar and\r\nMougheir, more particularly, every mound is a necropolis. Combining this\r\nfact with the no less striking one that there are no cemeteries in\r\nAssyria, M. Loftus has put forth the opinion that the inhabitants of\r\nthis last-named country, being Chaldæan by origin, regarded Chaldæa as a\r\nkind of holy land where they systematically buried their dead, and all\r\npersons rich enough to pay the somewhat heavy expenses connected with\r\nthe removal of the body, the religious ceremonies, &c., &c., made a\r\npoint of committing their departed relations and friends to their\r\neternal rest in the national _campo-santo_ from which they had in the\r\nfirst place emigrated. As for the poor and the slaves, those who were\r\nreckoned as nothing when alive, they were cast unceremoniously after\r\ntheir death into the first hole or ditch available for the purpose.\r\n\r\nWe must say a word or two on the concluding chapter before bringing this\r\nnotice to an end: it consists of an ingenious parallel between the\r\ncivilisations of Egypt and of Chaldæa, thus recapitulating the principal\r\nfacts given in the first volume as well as those contained in the one\r\nwhich has formed the subject of the present article.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations, amounting to nearly five hundred, are of two\r\ndifferent kinds; some occupy a whole page (temples, palaces, statues,\r\n&c.), others are inserted in the text; nor must we forget an excellent\r\nalphabetical index, and an appendix of additions and corrections.\r\n\r\n     _Quads within Quads, for Authors, Editors, and Devils._ Edited by\r\n     ANDREW W. TUER. Field & Tuer. 1884.\r\n\r\nUNDER the above quaint title Messrs. Field & Tuer have issued from “Ye\r\nLeadenhalle Presse” a little volume--or rather, two volumes in\r\none--which is likely in future ages to rank high amongst the treasures\r\nof the book collector. The work consists of an amusing collection of\r\nstories and _bon mots_ relating to authors, editors, and “devils,” which\r\nwe suppose is another name for the men of Paternoster-row; and there is\r\nan innocent raciness about them--the jokes, not the publishers--which\r\ncannot fail to entertain the reader. For the benefit of the uninitiated\r\nthe editor, in his introductory remarks, states that “quads” are “little\r\nmetal blanks used by the printer for filling up gaps,” and that they\r\n“are not of much account, although he cannot get along without them;\r\nhence the application of the word to printers’ jokes.” The book is\r\nbaulked out at the end with extra leaves of paper fastened together and\r\nhollowed out in the centre, and in the little nest so formed reposes a\r\ncopy of the miniature or midget-folio “Quad,” another equally quaint\r\nvolume, containing some 160 pages, and measuring but one inch in width\r\nby one and a half inches in length.\r\n\r\nTHE _Archæological Journal_ for July contains papers on “The Gallo-Roman\r\nMonuments of Reims,” by Mr. Bunnell Lewis; “On the Methods Used by the\r\nRomans for Extinguishing Conflagrations,” by the Rev. Joseph Hirst;\r\n“Jewish Seal found at Woodbridge,” by C. W. King, M.A.; “Roman Pottery\r\nfound at Worthing,” by Mr. A. J. Fenton; “Roman Inscriptions discovered\r\nin Britain in 1883,” by Mr. W. Thompson Watkin; “The Battle of Lewes,”\r\nby Rev. W. R. W. Stephens, M.A.; and “Some Remarks on the Pfahlgraben\r\nand Swalburg Camp in Germany, in Relation to the Roman Wall and Camps in\r\nNorthumberland,” by Mr. James Hilton, F.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeetings of Learned Societies.\r\n\r\nMETROPOLITAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES.--_June 26_, Dr. E. Freshfield, V.P., in the\r\nchair. Mr. W. H. Richardson exhibited some fragments of heraldic tiles\r\nwhich had been found under the floor of Fenny Compton Church,\r\nWarwickshire, and a drawing of a tile bearing the same inscription from\r\nWormleighton Church. The arms on the tiles appear to be those of Butler\r\nand Beauchamp respectively. Mr. R. S. Ferguson communicated some notes\r\non the tomb of Margaret, Countess Dowager of Cumberland, which had\r\nrecently been moved from its original position in the church of St.\r\nLawrence, Appleby, to a spot more convenient for the performance of\r\ndivine service. He also reported on recent discoveries in Cumberland,\r\nand exhibited some of the early Rolls of the City Court of Carlisle. In\r\nconnection with this paper Mr. Leveson-Gower exhibited an interesting\r\nportrait of his ancestress, the Countess of Cumberland. The Rev. W. F.\r\nCreeney exhibited a third instalment of rubbings of foreign brasses,\r\nthirty-four in number, which he had executed during a summer trip last\r\nyear, in which he had traversed over five thousand miles.\r\n\r\nROYAL ARCHÆOLOGICAL INSTITUTE.--_July 3_, the Rev. F. Spurrell in the\r\nchair. The Secretary read a communication from the Rev. Precentor\r\nVenables, describing the discovery of an intramural Roman family\r\nburial-place in Lincoln, and of a Roman well in the same city. Professor\r\nB. Lewis read a paper on “Roman Antiquities in Switzerland.” A number of\r\nRoman gems and coins, together with copies of inscriptions, engravings\r\nof mosaics, and other objects, collected by Professor Lewis and the Rev.\r\nS. S. Lewis, were exhibited in illustration of this paper. Mr. F.\r\nHelmore then read some remarks on stone coffins lately found in\r\nHertfordshire. The paper was illustrated by diagrams and drawings of two\r\nfine examples, probably of the thirteenth century, discovered at Tring\r\nand at Berkhampstead.\r\n\r\nLONDON AND MIDDLESEX ARCHÆOLOGICAL SOCIETY.--_June 16_, Mr. J. G. Waller\r\nin the chair. Mr. F. C. Sachs read a paper written by his brother, Mr.\r\nJohn Sachs, on “Arms and Armour,” in which he described those worn by\r\nthe ancient Egyptians and Assyrians. Greek, Roman, and Saxon armour was\r\nalso described, with the assistance of sketches and engravings which\r\nwere exhibited. While speaking of shields, Mr. Sachs described that used\r\nin the trophy of Henry V. in Westminster Abbey as made of oak, over the\r\nfront of which was first a covering of coarse flax, over which are\r\nstretched four layers of stout linen, on which traces of painted\r\ncolouring are still visible. The inside of the shield has been covered\r\nwith white silk, embroidered with needlework, a portion of which\r\nremains. The Chairman offered a few remarks on armour generally,\r\nincluding chain armour, plate armour, and “banded mail.” Mr. Thomas\r\nMillbourne made some observations on Mediæval London at the Health\r\nExhibition.--_June 26_, excursion to Rochester and Stroud. The\r\nproceedings commenced with a meeting in the Town Hall, Rochester, where,\r\nin the absence of the President, General Pitt-Rivers, F.R.S., the chair\r\nwas taken by Mr. Charles Roach Smith, F.S.A., V.P., who delivered an\r\naddress on the antiquities of Rochester, with special reference to the\r\nRoman wall, fragments of which are still visible. Mr. W. H. St. John\r\nHope, F.S.A., gave a lecture on the maces and other regalia of the City\r\nof Rochester, and Mr. R. S. Ferguson, F.S.A., of Carlisle, followed with\r\na few remarks on maces generally. The party afterwards paid a visit to\r\nthe Castle and the Cathedral, the chief architectural features of each\r\nbuilding being described by Mr. Hope, who traced the history of the\r\nCathedral from its foundation in the time of Ethelbert, and, with the\r\naid of diagrams, pointed out the work of successive architects from the\r\ntime of Bishop Gundulph. Eastgate House, an interesting Elizabethan\r\nbuilding in the High-street, now used as the Rochester Workmen’s Club,\r\nand Restoration House, the residence of Mr. Stephen Aveling, opposite\r\nthe Vines, were next examined. The latter building, which dates from\r\nabout 1580, was formerly called the Mansion or the Manor house, but its\r\nname was changed to Restoration House from having been the resting-place\r\nof Charles II., on his way from Dover to London on the eve of his\r\nrestoration to the throne. The members next visited the museum belonging\r\nto Mr. Humphrey Wickham, at Stroud, among the contents of which are a\r\nlarge number of Anglo-Saxon objects which had been discovered in the\r\nneighbourhood. Several of these objects were described by Mr. Roach\r\nSmith, who also pointed out the site of the ancient cemetery where many\r\nof the articles had been found, and spoke of the frequent destruction at\r\nStrood caused by the Medway overflowing its banks.\r\n\r\nROYAL SOCIETY OF LITERATURE.--_June 25_, Sir P. Colquhoun in the chair.\r\nDr. W. Knighton read a paper on the results of late excavations in Rome,\r\nconsidered in reference to the truth of its so-called legendary history.\r\nSome notes from Mr. W. S. W. Vaux on the subject were also read, and a\r\ndiscussion followed.\r\n\r\nNEW SHAKSPERE.--_May 30_, Mr. F. J. Furnivall in the chair. Mr. T.\r\nTyler, M.A., read the first of two papers on “Shakspere’s Sonnets.” With\r\nregard to the date, Mr. Tyler came to the conclusion that the Sonnets 1\r\nto 126 were written in 1598-1601. Taking the Sonnets 100 to 126 as\r\nforming a single poem, he found several allusions therein to the\r\nrebellion of Essex. This was alluded to in the “eclipse of the mortal\r\nmoon” (107), an expression which could not, as alleged by Massey, refer\r\nto the death of Queen Elizabeth, since the point is that “the mortal\r\nmoon” had “endured” her eclipse, in accordance with the general drift of\r\nthe sonnet. Sonnet 55, Mr. Tyler maintained, was written after the\r\npublication of Meres’s “Palladis Tamia” in 1598. “Mr. W. H.,” mentioned\r\nin the dedication of the 4to. edition of 1609, was, in his opinion,\r\nWilliam Herbert, who in 1601 became Lord Pembroke. In support of this\r\nview some new evidence was adduced from documents in the Record Office,\r\nthe British Museum, and in the Marquis of Salisbury’s collection at\r\nHatfield, relating especially to an amour of Lord Pembroke with Mrs.\r\nFytton, a maid of honour to Queen Elizabeth, an amour for which Lord\r\nPembroke was imprisoned in the Fleet, in March, 1601. On his release\r\nfrom prison, Sonnets 100 to 126 were addressed to him. Three years\r\nbackwards from this time, according to Sonnet 104, give the initial date\r\nof 1598.--_June 13_, Mr. F. J. Furnivall, Director, in the chair. The\r\nRev. W. A. Harrison read copies of letters from the Earl and Countess of\r\nPembroke and the Earl of Oxford to Lord Burghley, showing that in 1579,\r\nwhen William Herbert was only seventeen, his parents had in hand a\r\nscheme for his marriage forthwith to Bridget, granddaughter to Lord\r\nBurghley. Mr. Tyler read his second paper “On Shakspere’s Sonnets.”\r\nAfter alluding to the theory, recently put forth, that the rival poet of\r\nthe sonnets was Dante, Mr. Tyler maintained that the poet intended was\r\nGeorge Chapman. The dark lady of Sonnets 127 to 152 was probably Mrs.\r\nFytton, maid of honour to Queen Elizabeth. The relations of this lady\r\nwith William Herbert would not unreasonably, in view of several of the\r\nsonnets, as 40 and 144, suggest the identification. So far as there were\r\nmaterials for comparison, the character of Mrs. Fytton showed a\r\nremarkable agreement with that of the dark lady. A difficulty had been\r\nfelt as to Shakspere’s writing of himself at thirty-five as though in\r\ndeclining age. But this difficulty was removed by comparing Sonnet 73,\r\nits “yellow leaves,” “bare boughs,” &c., with Byron’s poem written when\r\nhe attained his thirty-sixth year, where the imagery was remarkably\r\nsimilar.\r\n\r\nFOLK-LORE.--_June 14_, annual meeting. Earl Beauchamp in the chair. In\r\nthe annual report for the past year a strong plea was made for more aid\r\nto carry on the work already in hand. The Bishop of St. John’s,\r\nKaffraria, has presented to the Society several copies of his “Zulu\r\nNursery Literature,” and of his “Religious System of the Amazulu.” The\r\nwork selected for the 1884 issue is a collection of Magyar folk-tales,\r\nby the Rev. W. H. Jones and Mr. L. Kropf.\r\n\r\nASIATIC.--_May 19_, anniversary meeting. Sir H. C. Rawlinson in the\r\nchair. The following were elected as the officers of next year:\r\nPresident, Sir W. Muir; Director, Sir H. C. Rawlinson; Vice-Presidents,\r\nSir T. E. Colebrooke, Sir B. H. Ellis, J. Fergusson, and A. Grote;\r\nCouncil, E. Arnold, C. Bendall, E. L. Brandreth, Dr. O. Codrington, F.\r\nV. Dickins, Major-General Sir F. Goldsmid, Major-General M. R. Haig, H.\r\nC. Kay, Major-General Keatinge, Lieut.-General Sir L. Pelly,\r\nMajor-General Sir A. Phayre, Sir W. R. Robinson, T. H. Thornton, M. J.\r\nWalhouse, and Col. Yule; Treasurer, E. Thomas; Secretaries, W. S. W.\r\nVaux and H. F. W. Holt; Hon. Secretary, R. N. Cust. Prof. Monier\r\nWilliams gave an account of his recent visit to India and to the Jain\r\nand Buddhist temples there, and added that the Supreme Government at\r\nCalcutta had assented to his proposal to found six scholarships for\r\ndeserving natives in the Indian Institute at Oxford.--_June 16_, Sir W.\r\nMuir, President, in the chair. Professor de Lacouperie read a paper “On\r\nThree Embassies from Indo-China to the Middle Kingdom, and on the Trade\r\nRoutes thither 3,000 Years Ago.” During the reign of Tch’ing, the second\r\nking of the Tchen dynasty (about B.C. 1100), three embassies came to him\r\nfrom Indo-China, before his power was firmly established to the south of\r\nthe Yangtze Kiang. These were really travelling parties of merchants,\r\nwho had heard of the wealth of the new dynasty from the tribes of West\r\nand South China, who had helped the Tchen to overthrow the preceding\r\ndynasty. Only a few fragments of information about them have survived,\r\nand these in a much altered state. At the close of his paper the\r\nProfessor passed in review six annual trade-routes between India,\r\nCochin-China, and China, previously to the Christian era. Of these two\r\nare important, viz., the one through Assam to India, and the other to\r\nTung-King by the Red River. It was by the latter that the sea-traders of\r\nKattigara (Hanoi) heard of the important trading state of Tsen (in\r\nYunnan), this name being, in fact, the antecedent of that of China. Dr.\r\nT. Tuka exhibited forty pieces of Tibetan printed books and MSS. which\r\nthe late A. C. de Koros gave in 1839 to the Rev. Dr. S. C. Malan, then\r\nsecretary of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and which this gentleman has\r\npresented to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences at Buda-Pesth.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICAL.--_May 20_, Mr. R. Lawson, V.P., in the chair. Mr. C.\r\nWalford read a paper entitled “A Statistical Review of Canada.”\r\n\r\nNUMISMATIC.--_May_ 15, Dr. J. Evans, President, in the chair. Mr. H.\r\nMontagu exhibited a half-halfpenny or farthing of Eadred, the original\r\ncoin having been bisected for the purpose of creating two farthings, in\r\nthe same way as pennies were frequently halved and quartered. Mr. J. G.\r\nHall exhibited a hammered sovereign of Charles II.’s first coinage with\r\nthe numerals XX behind the head of the king; weight, 138 grains. Mr. B.\r\nV. Head read a paper, by Mr. C. F. Keary, on a hoard of Anglo-Saxon\r\ncoins found in Rome during some recent excavations on the site of the\r\nHouse of the Vestals at the foot of the Palatine. The “find” consisted\r\nof 830 Anglo-Saxon pennies, ranging from A.D. 871 to 947. It represented\r\nan instalment of the tribute money popularly known as Peter’s pence, a\r\ndevotional gift instituted in the 8th or 9th century, consisting of a\r\ndenarius a year, payable by the head of every family possessed of a\r\ncertain quantity of land, at St. Peter’s mass, on pain of\r\nexcommunication. Mr. Keary said that the hoard of coins was of\r\nconsiderable numismatic importance, as it yielded the names of many new\r\nmoneyers and of some new towns. Mr. N. Heywood communicated a notice of\r\nthe discovery of Anglo-Saxon coins beneath the foundations of Waterloo\r\nBridge. Mr. Toplis sent a list of forty varieties of 17th century\r\ntradesmen’s tokens of Nottinghamshire not described in Boyne’s work.\r\n\r\nPHILOLOGICAL.--_May 16_, anniversary meeting. Dr. J. A. H. Murray\r\nPresident, in the chair. The President delivered his annual address.\r\nAfter noticing the members who had died since last anniversary, and\r\nreviewing the work of the Society during the last two years, he read\r\nreports by Mr. W. R. Morfill, on the Slavonic languages; by M. Paul\r\nHunfalvy and Mr. Patterson on Hungarian since 1873; by Mr. E. G. Brown\r\non Turkish; and by Mr. R. M. Cust, on the Hamitic languages of North\r\nAfrica. Mr. H. Sweet read his own report “On the Practical Study of\r\nLanguage.” The President then gave an account of the progress of the\r\nSociety’s Dictionary, and dwelt on the difficulty of settling the\r\netymology of Middle English words and of making out the logical\r\ndevelopment of important words of long standing. The following Members\r\nwere elected the Society’s officers for the ensuing year: President,\r\nRev. Prof. W. W. Skeat; Vice-Presidents, the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr.\r\nW. Stokes, A. J. Ellis, Rev. R. Morris, H. Sweet, Dr. J. A. H. Murray,\r\nand Prince Lucien Bonaparte; Ordinary Members of Council, Prof. A. G.\r\nBell, H. Bradshaw, E. L. Brandreth, W. R. Browne, Prof. C. Cassal, R. N.\r\nCust, Sir J. F. Davis, F. T. Elworthy, H. H. Gibbs, H. Jenner, Dr. E. L.\r\nLushington, Prof. R. Martineau, A. J. Patterson, J. Peile, Prof. J. P.\r\nPostgate, Prof. C. Rieu, Rev. A. H. Sayce, Dr. E. B. Tylor, H. Wedgwood,\r\nand R. F. Weymouth; Treasurer, B. Dawson; Hon. Sec., F. J. Furnivall. A\r\nvote of thanks was passed to Mr. Gladstone for his grant of a pension of\r\n£250 a year to the editor of the Society’s Dictionary.\r\n\r\nANTHROPOLOGICAL.--_May 13_, Prof. Flower, President, in the chair. Dr.\r\nJ. Stephens sent a drawing of a large pointed palæolithic implement,\r\nfound near Reading. Mr. W. G. Smith exhibited two palæolithic implements\r\nlately found in North London: one was made of quartzite, and is the\r\nfirst example of this material met with in the London gravels; the other\r\nwas a white implement from the “trail and warp.” He also exhibited two\r\nwhite porcellaneous palæolithic flakes replaced on their original\r\nblocks. A paper on “The Ethnology of the Andaman Islands,” by Mr. E. H.\r\nMan, was read. Prof. Flower read some “Additional Observations on the\r\nOsteology of the Natives of the Andaman Islands.” Since reading a paper\r\nbefore the Institute on the same subject in 1879 the author had had the\r\nopportunity of examining ten skeletons, two of which are in the\r\nUniversity of Oxford, and eight in the Barnard Davis collection at the\r\nmuseum of the Royal College of Surgeons.--_May 27_, Prof. Flower,\r\nPresident, in the chair. Mr. H. O. Forbes read a paper “On the Kubus of\r\nSumatra.” Dr. Garson read a paper “On the Osteology of the Kubus.” Mr.\r\nT. Bent read some “Notes on Prehistoric Remains in Antiparos,” and\r\nexhibited several specimens of pottery, some rudely carved marble\r\nfigures, and a skull from cemeteries in that island.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVINCIAL.\r\n\r\nBERKSHIRE ARCHÆOLOGICAL AND ARCHITECTURAL SOCIETY.--On Tuesday, July 1,\r\nvisits were paid to St. Helen’s Church, Abingdon, Cumnor Church,\r\nAppleton Church and Manor House, and also Fyfield Church and Manor,\r\nwhere they were entertained at luncheon by Mr. and Mrs. James Parker. At\r\nCumnor the party inspected the site of Old Cumnor Hall, where Mr. Parker\r\nnarrated its history since the sixteenth century, and examined the story\r\nof Amy Robsart’s life and supposed murder, as narrated by Sir Walter\r\nScott in his novel of “Kenilworth.” At Fyfield Manor Mr. Parker\r\nconducted the party through the various rooms, showing them, among\r\nother things of interest, a recently-discovered stone mantelpiece, with\r\ninitials and date of the early part of the seventeenth century. At\r\nAbingdon, after inspecting St. Helen’s Church, the party examined the\r\nancient deeds and charters in the Hall of Christ’s Hospital, the\r\nCorporation plate and pictures, the remains of the Abbey, and other\r\nobjects of interest.\r\n\r\nBRIGHTON AND SUSSEX NATURAL HISTORY SOCIETY.--_June 19_, Dr. Hollis,\r\nPresident, in the chair. Mr. F. E. Sawyer read a paper on “Sussex\r\nDialect and Speech,” in which he referred to a branch of the subject\r\nwhich had not hitherto received sufficient attention, namely, the\r\nconnection of dialect with the early spellings of place-names.\r\nDerivations of names, Mr. Sawyer observed, are too often based on modern\r\nforms of spelling, when a careful examination would show the older forms\r\nto be attempts of strange or foreign scribes to represent phonetically\r\ndialectal pronunciation of place-names. “The termination ‘ing,’” he\r\ncontinued, “is generally considered to be patronymic, and as it is a\r\npeculiarity of the Sussex dialect to drop the final ‘g,’ as Cockneys do,\r\nwe may consider that many old names not mentioned by Kemble are\r\npatronymic, _i.e._, of tribal origin, and deriving their names from some\r\ntribal ancestor.” There is a close connection, Mr. Sawyer remarked in\r\nconclusion, between place-names and surnames, and in Sussex the Saxon\r\nelement will be found very strongly marked amongst the surnames.\r\n\r\nESSEX FIELD CLUB.--_June 21_, the members and friends paid a visit to\r\nEpping Forest. On arriving at the ancient earthwork called Ambresbury\r\nBank, Mr. J. E. Harting, F.L.S., delivered a discourse on “The Deer of\r\nEpping Forest,” in which he treated firstly of the antiquity of the\r\nforest as a hunting-ground of the Kings and Queens of England; and,\r\nsecondly, of the nature of the deer which were hunted, and the present\r\ncondition of the two kinds of deer which may be found there. The forest\r\nwas in early times called the Forest of Essex, as being the only forest\r\nwithin that county, nearly the whole of which was anciently comprehended\r\nwithin it. As its extent became abridged it was called the Forest of\r\nWaltham, from the first village of importance which sprung up within its\r\npurlieus. According to Camden, the first mention occurs about the latter\r\ntimes of the Saxons, when Tovi, standard-bearer to King Canute, “induced\r\nby the abundance of deer, built a number of houses here, and peopled\r\nthem with sixty-six inhabitants.” After his death, his son Athelstan\r\nsquandered the estate, whereupon Edward the Confessor, into whose hands\r\nit had come, bestowed the village on his brother-in-law, Harold, son of\r\nEarl Godwin, who built Waltham Abbey. The Abbot was one of the few\r\nresidents in the neighbourhood who, besides the King, was privileged to\r\nkill deer in this forest, although mediæval records contain notices of\r\nroyal permission given at times to the citizens of London to use the\r\nForest of Epping as a hunting-ground for their recreation. Henry III.,\r\nin 1226, granted to the citizens the privilege of hunting once a year,\r\nat Easter, within a circuit of twenty miles of the city, and until\r\nwithin comparatively recent times the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and\r\nCorporation continued annually to avail themselves of this privilege. At\r\nthe conclusion of Mr. Hastings’ lecture the party moved on towards\r\nLoughton, passing on the way through the ancient earthwork known as\r\nCowper’s Camp, which was explored by the Club in 1883.\r\n\r\nSOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF SCOTLAND.--_June 9_, Sir William F. Douglas,\r\nP.R.S.A. (Scot.), in the chair. Mr. J. Romilly Allen, F.S.A. (Scot.),\r\nread a paper entitled “Notes on Early Christian Symbolism.” The author\r\nin dealing with that special branch of the subject which includes the\r\nrepresentations sculptured on the fonts, tympana of doorways, and other\r\ncarved stonework of the Norman period, showed what ample material there\r\nis to form a museum of Christian archæology, by having casts taken of\r\nthese sculptured fonts, tympana, &c., so that they might be placed\r\ntogether in one gallery, and thus be made to yield whatever scientific\r\nresults are attainable from them. Mr. Allen gave a list classified by\r\nsubjects and localities of upwards of 120 tympana, 80 fonts, and 30\r\npieces of miscellaneous sculpture. The paper was illustrated by a series\r\nof drawings and photographs of the principal types of the symbolic\r\nrepresentations on Norman fonts and tympana. The second paper was a\r\nnotice by Mr. Charles Stewart of Tigh’n Duin, Killin, of several\r\nsepulchral mounds and cup-marked stones in the district of Fortingall,\r\nGlenylon, Perthshire; and the Rev. Hugh Macmillan, D.D., of Greenock,\r\nfollowed with a description of two boulders having rain-filled cavities\r\non the shores of Loch Tay, formerly associated with the cure of disease.\r\nMr. George Sim, Curator of Coins, gave an account of recent “finds” of\r\ncoins in Scotland. Only two discoveries have occurred during the\r\nsession--one of 177 silver pennies, chiefly of the Edwards, at Arkleton,\r\nDumfriesshire; and one of 53 silver coins, chiefly of Mary and\r\nElizabeth, at Woodend, in the Isle of Skye. The last paper was a\r\ndescriptive notice of the stone circles of Strathnairn and neighbourhood\r\nof Inverness, by Mr. James Fraser, C.E. Twenty-five of the circles were\r\ndescribed, and accurate plans of them, made to a uniform scale of ten\r\nfeet to the inch, were exhibited, forming a body of materials for the\r\ncomparative study of stone circles of unprecedented extent and value.\r\nFive old Communion flagons and a chalice and paten of pewter, from Old\r\nSt. Paul’s Church, were exhibited by Rev. R. Mitchell-Innes. Two of the\r\nflagons show the Edinburgh Pewterers’ stamp, and one has the maker’s\r\nname--John Durand, 1688.\r\n\r\nHAILEYBURY ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY.--_May 19._ The Secretary gave a short\r\naccount of the village of Burnham Thorpe, Norfolk, famous chiefly as the\r\nbirthplace of Admiral Nelson. Mr. C. F. Gisborne spoke of Wichnor\r\nChurch, Derbyshire, as Anglo-Saxon, but with a Norman tower. He also\r\nspoke of the parish of Langley Marish, near Slough, which is a\r\ncorruption of Langley Maries, the church there being dedicated to the\r\nThree Maries; he mentioned that there were some old half-timbered\r\nalmshouses in the parish. W. Kennedy, Esq., gave a description of Morton\r\nVilla, near Brading, where extensive excavations have recently taken\r\nplace. This villa is the largest in England. Most of the walls seem to\r\nhave been built of wood filled up with rubble, and are consequently very\r\nstrong. There is a great deal of very fine Roman glass in the house. The\r\nvilla was probably burnt down when the Romans left England, A.D. 410.\r\nThe speaker then went on to describe Carisbrook Castle, which was built\r\nby William of Osborne, in 1066 A.D., and is chiefly famous for the\r\nrecollections of Charles I. The President then spoke very briefly of\r\nTantallon Castle and the Collegiate Church of Haddington.--_June 2_, Mr.\r\nC. F. Gisborne read a short paper on Christ Church, Bournemouth, Hants,\r\nand the President gave a short account of the most interesting features\r\nof St. Albans Abbey.--On Saturday, June 14, an excursion was made to\r\nGreenwich Hospital.--_June 16_, Mr. W. Kennedy gave a short lecture on\r\nRome, in which he spoke of the ruins of the gigantic houses built by the\r\nEmperors for themselves on the Palatine, and of the palace of Augustus,\r\nof which but few traces remain. The lecturer described the private\r\nhouse of the father of Tiberius, on the Palatine, and then passed on to\r\nspeak of the palace of Vespasian. Mr. Kennedy also mentioned the\r\ndiscovery of a Pedagogium, or school for the slaves of the Imperial\r\nhousehold; and spoke of the curious caricatures and paintings on the\r\nwalls, done apparently by the students.--_July 1_, Mr. E. Walford gave a\r\nlecture on the “Watering Places of Old,” in which he treated of\r\nBrighton, Bath, Seaford, Hythe, &c. His account of Seaford may probably\r\nappear in the pages of this Magazine.\r\n\r\nLANCASHIRE AND CHESHIRE ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY.--_June 28_, about 50\r\nmembers, accompanied by a few ladies, visited Lancaster. The party first\r\ninspected the castle, where they were shown the ancient dungeons, the\r\ngateway tower built by Henry V., &c., and afterwards ascended to the top\r\nof the Norman keep, or “John O’Gaunt’s chair,” whence a splendid view of\r\nthe Lake Mountains was obtained. The parish church of St. Mary, a fine\r\nspecimen of the Perpendicular period, was next visited, and its details\r\ndescribed by Mr. Paley, F.R.I.B.A. After luncheon the excursion was\r\ncontinued to Heysham, where the rector, the Rev. C. T. Royds, showed the\r\nparty over the ancient Norman church at that place. On returning to\r\nLancaster in the evening, an adjournment was made to the Amicable\r\nLibrary, where several old charters of the town, the municipal regalia,\r\nand a few Roman antiquities found in the neighbourhood, were displayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAntiquarian News & Notes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. D. BOGUE will issue shortly an etching, by Percy Thomas, of the old\r\nLondon street at the Health Exhibition.\r\n\r\nMR. MURRAY announces a translation by Professor A. S. Wilkins and Mr. E.\r\nB. England of the “Principles of Greek Etymology,” by Professor Curtius.\r\n\r\nTHE Rev. R. H. Clutterbuck has discovered among the Corporation records\r\nof Andover some interesting early Guild-rolls, which will probably be\r\npublished _in extenso_.\r\n\r\nTHE Berks Archæological and Architectural Society is offering prizes for\r\nhistorical essays on subjects having reference to Berkshire, and for\r\narchitectural drawings, illustrating ancient buildings in the county.\r\n\r\nAN antiquarian column is about to be started in the _Essex Standard and\r\nWest Suffolk Gazette_, published at Colchester. It will contain notes\r\nand queries on local antiquities, and a special series of gleanings from\r\nold local newspapers.\r\n\r\nMR. MURRAY’S latest list of recent publications contains, _inter alia_,\r\nProfessor Brewer’s “Reign of Henry VIII., from his accession till the\r\ndeath of Wolsey;” Dr. Schliemann’s works, “Troja,” “Ilios,” and “Mycenæ\r\nand Argos;” Mr. A. S. Murray’s “History of Greek Sculpture.”\r\n\r\nTHE Schools of the Christian Brothers of France have sent to the Health\r\nExhibition at South Kensington, a collection of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew\r\ninscriptions, with representations of the Provençal people and buildings\r\nof the fifteenth century, modelled and arranged by the pupils.\r\n\r\nMR. CORNELIUS WALFORD, F.S.S., Barrister-at-Law, has been awarded the\r\nfirst “Samuel Brown Prize” of Fifty Guineas, offered by the Institute of\r\nActuaries for the best Essay on the “History of Life Insurance.” The\r\nessay will be published.\r\n\r\nMR. J. TAYLOR, of Northampton, has announced for sale the unique\r\ncollection of historical MSS., &c., of John Cole, of Northampton,\r\n(1792-1840), embracing brief notices of his family and literary\r\ncontemporaries, together with the history and antiquities of several\r\nparishes in Northamptonshire, &c.\r\n\r\nTHE following articles, more or less of an antiquarian character, appear\r\namong the contents of the magazines for July: _Cornhill_, “Embalmers;”\r\n_Cassell’s Magazine_, “Derby China;” _Blackwood_, “Venice;” _Century\r\nMagazine_, “A Greek Play at Cambridge;” _Atlantic Monthly_, “The Haunts\r\nof Galileo,” and “Peter the Great;” _Magazine of Art_, “Walks in\r\nSurrey,” and “The Austrian Museum;” _Home Chimes_, “Old Gold;”\r\n_Clergyman’s Magazine_, “Biblical Notices of Egypt, illustrated from\r\nProfane Sources.”\r\n\r\nPLANS and drawings for the reconstruction of the west side of\r\nWestminster Hall, and the preservation of the Norman work lately laid\r\nbare by the pulling down of the Law Courts, have been prepared by Mr.\r\nPearson, R.A., and the estimated cost of the work is about £37,000.\r\nDuring the restoration of the north front, some years ago, considerable\r\nportions of the ancient work of the Hall were for a short time visible,\r\nand again at a later period the whole of the Norman walls were laid\r\nbare, to be re-cased by Sir Robert Smirke. It has remained for the\r\nremoval of the Law Courts to uncover permanently the earlier Norman\r\nwalls, fortunately in a fairly perfect state of preservation.\r\n\r\nCATALOGUES of rare and curious books, all of which contain the names of\r\nworks of antiquarian interest, have reached us from Messrs. Farrar &\r\nFenton, 8, John-street, Adelphi, W.C.; Messrs. Reeves & Turner, 196,\r\nStrand, W.C.; Mr. J. Hitchman, 51, Cherry-street, Birmingham; Messrs.\r\nQuaritch, 15, Piccadilly (including the major portion of the Hamilton\r\nPalace Library); Mr. W. J. Withers, Leicester; Mr. F. Edwards, 83,\r\nHigh-street, Marylebone; Mr. Edward Howell, 28, Church-street,\r\nLiverpool; Mr. G. P. Johnston, 33, George-street, Edinburgh; Mr. W. P.\r\nBennett, 3, Bull-street, Birmingham; Messrs. Sutton & Son, 91,\r\nOxford-street, Manchester; Mr. J. Coleman, Tottenham, N.

Robson & Kerslake, 43, Cranbourne-street, W.C. (includes a fine\r\ncopy of the Nuremberg Bible of 1477, and Albert Durer’s “Life of the\r\nVirgin, &c.); Mr. U. Maggs, 159, Church-street, Paddington-green, W.;\r\nMr. H. Edwardes, 20, Drury-court, W.C.\r\n\r\nSOME doubts having arisen as to whether authorities which act under the\r\nPublic Libraries Act have powers to fulfil the conditions required for a\r\nParliamentary grant in aid of the establishment of a school of science\r\nand art, the Lord President has brought in a Bill, which declares that\r\nwhere an authority accepts a grant of this kind from the Education\r\nCommittee of the Privy Council, it shall have power to do so on the\r\nconditions prescribed by the Committee, and it is to be, as also are its\r\nsuccessors, bound to fulfil them. An interpretation is also placed on\r\nthe 8th section of the Public Libraries Act of 1855, which enables the\r\nCouncil of a borough and the Board of a district to erect buildings for\r\nthe purposes of the Act. It is declared that under this and the\r\ncorresponding Scotch and Irish provisions buildings may be erected in\r\nany of the three Kingdoms “for public libraries, public museums, schools\r\nfor science, art galleries, and schools for art, or for any one or more\r\nof those objects.” Where one of these institutions is established under\r\nthe Public Libraries Acts, any other may (it is here provided) be\r\nestablished at any time in connection therewith without further\r\nproceedings being taken under the Acts.--_The Times._\r\n\r\nIN the first week of July the City of Winchester commemorated the 700th\r\nanniversary of its incorporation by a series of festivities, in which\r\nthe Bishop of the Diocese, the Lord Mayor of London, and a number of\r\nprovincial chief magistrates took part. The proceedings included a\r\nprocession to the Cathedral, where the Dean delivered an address, in\r\nwhich he traced the gradual growth of freedom under municipal\r\ninstitutions. A public luncheon afterwards took place in the restored\r\nbanqueting-hall of the Palace, and in the evening there was a torchlight\r\nprocession, together with a series of _tableaux vivants_, which were\r\nwitnessed by crowds of persons. The persons who appeared as actors in\r\nevents affecting the fortunes of Winchester were habited in dresses\r\ndesigned from authentic records of the period. First came a\r\nrepresentation of the granting of the charter of incorporation to the\r\ncity by Henry II.; the second picture represented Richard II. giving the\r\ncharter to William of Wykeham; the third, Henry VI. and Church\r\ndignitaries before the shrine of St. Swithin in Winchester Cathedral;\r\nthe fourth, Charles I. brought a prisoner to the city on December 21,\r\n1648; the fifth representing some Roundheads searching for Royalists,\r\nand looking in at the window of a forge, where a Royalist, disguised as\r\na blacksmith, was talking to the owner of the forge; the sixth, Sir\r\nChristopher Wren presenting plans for a Royal Palace at Winchester to\r\nCharles II. The anniversary will be further perpetuated by the\r\npublication of a volume entitled “Memorials of the City of Winchester: a\r\nCollection of Charters and other Records Illustrating its Municipal\r\nHistory,” edited by Mr. F. J. Baigent, F.S.A.\r\n\r\nAN antiquary writes to the _Athenæum_ as follows regarding the\r\nlamentable destruction of documents belonging to the see of Durham and\r\nlodged in a building within the precincts of the episcopal palace at\r\nBishop Auckland: “In a building adjoining the gateway of the episcopal\r\npalace of the Bishop of Durham a large number of documents--how valuable\r\nit is impossible to say--were preserved until a short time ago. It seems\r\nthat this building was required for the holding of clerical meetings and\r\nother purposes; and, in order to make it more convenient for these, the\r\ndocuments, which had hitherto found a safe repository there, were\r\nremoved, and without, apparently, any proper examination having been\r\nmade, were destroyed. A few of them were, happily, rescued, and judging\r\nfrom these some reasonable conjecture may be arrived at with regard to\r\nthe nature of the mass of the documents. Among those which have been\r\npreserved are a survey of Allertonshire--an ancient possession of the\r\nChurch of Durham--made in the middle of the seventeenth century; an\r\ninventory of the contents of the episcopal castle at Durham in the\r\nmiddle of the eighteenth century; a complete list of Roman Catholics\r\nresident within the city of Durham in the year 1700; a report to the\r\nBishop from Sir William Williamson, Sheriff of the County of Durham, and\r\ncertain justices of the peace, about proceedings against Papists in\r\n1743; and a list of the rolls and other muniments formerly kept in the\r\nauditor’s office at Durham, but now removed and placed somewhere among\r\nthe enormous mass of valuable material, locked up and practically\r\ninaccessible, within the offices of the Ecclesiastical Commission or of\r\nsome of its officials. Who is the person responsible for the unwarranted\r\ndestruction I do not know, but it is most desirable that the public\r\nshould be made acquainted with what has taken place, and that it should\r\nbe made known by whose authority these valuable records have been\r\ndestroyed.”\r\n\r\nTHROUGH the courtesy of Mr. Bosworth Smith, the _Athenæum_ has been\r\nenabled to print an interesting letter by Mr. H. A. Brown, regarding\r\nsome explorations which he has been making in Minorca. He has visited a\r\nremarkable cave city which has not been properly explored:--“The\r\nlocality is a wild-looking inlet between high cliffs. In these cliffs\r\nare a vast number of rock-hewn caves--possibly 300. Such tradition as\r\nthere is concerning this most curious spot ascribes it to the\r\nPhœnicians; but we concur in thinking that it is the work of a much\r\nearlier people.... In some of the larger ones there are evidences of\r\nconsiderable development; for instance, in one of the largest are three\r\nrecesses in the wall, some two feet from the ground, a sort of rock\r\ndivan, while several have ante-chambers communicating with the main\r\nroom; but, on the other hand, the smaller are mere holes in the rock,\r\nhaving, however, in some cases, a sill, or threshold, distinctly raised\r\nabove the level of the floor. It seems to us that this disparity may be\r\naccounted for in three ways: either the people during a long occupation\r\nadvanced in the construction of their dwellings, or the smaller caves\r\nare merely the tombs of the inhabitants of the larger, or possibly the\r\nchiefs inhabited the large and the people the small caves.... The small\r\ncaves are all in a more or less inaccessible position, but having\r\nentered one near the ground we commenced to dig. At about nine or twelve\r\ninches down we came upon the bones of animals and two most remarkable\r\nskulls. Being compelled by pressure of time to move on, we went round\r\nthe inlet and entered a cave on the other side, higher up the cliff than\r\nthe former. Immediately after removing the loose sand, we came to thick,\r\nblack earth, and the first stroke of the hatchet brought up some human\r\nbones, and by the time we were obliged to leave, the best part of a\r\nskeleton was unearthed, including several pieces of the skull. The\r\nmajority of the bones were of a reddish colour, but all in one corner\r\nwere perfectly black, either from extreme age or the action of fire.”\r\n\r\nTHE _Temps_ gives an account of the collection of objects found by\r\nMonsieur Nicaise in the tombs of the ancient Gauls, Département de la\r\nMarne, which he laid before the Academie des Inscriptions de Paris at\r\ntheir meeting, April 18. The collection is of great interest, and in\r\nsome respects unique. It includes a great variety of implements of\r\nwarfare, jewellery, enamels, and finely wrought bronze ornaments, and\r\nsome articles of toilet throwing a light on the mode of shaving 2,000\r\nyears ago. The razors found are shaped like a sickle. With them was\r\nfound a vessel supposed by Monsieur Bertholot, who was present at the\r\nmeeting, to have contained soap, which he states was by no means unknown\r\nto the ancient Gaul. A coral necklace, bleached by its couple of\r\nthousand years’ sepulture, is remarkable. Between the beads of coral are\r\nvarious amulets or charms, such as a wild boar’s tooth, a shell, and a\r\npeculiar thin circular plate or disc of bone, ascertained beyond doubt\r\nto be part of the human vertebræ. There are also numerous bronze torques\r\nfinely worked, and a fragment of a jewel similar in workmanship to the\r\nfinest granulated or filigree jewellery so well known at Genoa and\r\nVenice at the present day. A skeleton of a female was found adorned with\r\nnecklace, bracelets, and anklets. A bracelet, from its diminutive size,\r\nmust have been retained on the arm during its growth from childhood to\r\nwomanhood. Not the least curious is an ornament composed of a material\r\nwhich gave rise to many conjectures, but which careful analysis shows\r\nto consist of some argillaceous or ceramic compound, finely pulverised,\r\nthen agglutinised and compressed until it formed a solid agglomerated\r\nsubstance of a texture capable of receiving the highest polish. The\r\nrevelations of these ancient sepultures, and the high artistic merit of\r\nthe articles they contain, justify the inference that the “barbarism”\r\nwith which Julius Cæsar was so impressed in Gaul, was a barbarism\r\nstrongly impregnated with civilisation.\r\n\r\nTHE annual summer congress of the Royal Archæological Institute will be\r\nheld this year at Newcastle-on-Tyne, during the week from Tuesday,\r\nAugust 5, to Wednesday, August 13 inclusive, under the Presidentship of\r\nthe Duke of Northumberland. Tuesday, the 5th, will be devoted to an\r\ninspection of the castle and cathedral of Newcastle, after the public\r\nreception of the Society by the Mayor and Corporation at the inaugural\r\nmeeting. On Wednesday the Archæologists will visit Warkworth and Alnwick\r\nCastle, which will be described by Mr. Clark. On Thursday they will go\r\nby train to Beal, from which place Lindisfarne and Holy Island with its\r\nchurch and castle will be visited. Friday will be devoted to a visit by\r\nrail to Belford and to Bamburgh Castle. On Saturday the annual meeting\r\nof the Society will be held. At its conclusion the members will proceed\r\nto Jarrow, Monkwearmouth, and, by steamer down the river, to Tynemouth.\r\nOn Sunday a special service will be held in the cathedral, when it is\r\nexpected that the Bishop of Newcastle, Dr. Wilberforce, will preach.\r\nMonday will be devoted to an inspection of sundry parts of the Roman\r\nwall, and to a visit to Chesters, where the Roman remains will be\r\nexplained by the Rev. J. C. Bruce. On Tuesday the Archæologists will go\r\nby train to Corbridge, from which they will visit Aydon Castle, Bywell,\r\nand Prudhoe Castle. Wednesday will be occupied by a visit to Durham,\r\nwhere the cathedral and castle, and probably Finchall Priory, will be\r\ninspected. There will be a meeting on the evening of Tuesday, at which\r\npapers will be read, and probably, also, at least one conversazione. A\r\ntemporary local museum, under Mr. R. Blair, F.S.A., will be open during\r\nthe week in the Black Gate, where also the sectional meetings will be\r\nheld. Among those who have sent their names as patrons of the congress\r\nare the Duke of Portland, Lords Ravensworth and Scarbrough, the Bishops\r\nof Durham, Carlisle, Newcastle, and Hexham; Sir Charles Trevelyan, Sir\r\nJoseph Pease, Sir Edward Blackett, Sir Matthew White Ridley, and Sir\r\nWalter James, &c.\r\n\r\n“IN the early part of last winter,” writes a correspondent of _The\r\nTimes_, “operations were begun in the bed of the Rhone, at Geneva, in\r\nconnection with a scheme for utilising the power of the stream for\r\nmechanical purposes. During the work a part of the river bed, near the\r\nisland on which stands Julius Cæsar’s Tower, and where Philibert\r\nBerthelier, the Genevan patriot, suffered death, was laid bare, and in\r\nview of the great antiquity of Geneva, and the fact that it was an\r\nAllobrogian town before it became a Roman station, sanguine expectations\r\nwere entertained as to the likelihood of making important archæologic\r\nfinds.” These hopes have not been disappointed; for there has been\r\nlately found, buried in gravel among a range of piles, relics of the\r\nlacustrine age, a block of white Jurassic rock, evidently dressed by the\r\nhand of man, and having in the centre a circular depression surrounded\r\nby a sort of crown. Further examination showed it to be the upper part\r\nof a Roman altar. It is in the ordinary form of a pilaster with capitals\r\nand a corresponding base terminating in a crown, in relief, cut in the\r\nstone. The height of the relic is 80 centimetres, the width 33. There is\r\nno other trace of ornamentation than the mouldings and cornices of the\r\nupper and lower parts, but on the principal face there appears an\r\ninscription, in superb letters and an admirable state of preservation.\r\nIt runs thus: DEO NEPTVN C. VITALINIV VICTORINVS MILES LEGI. XXII.\r\nACVRIS V. S. L. M. Only two letters are lacking. At the end of the\r\nsecond word the engraver had not room for the final O, and at the end of\r\nthe fourth word an S has been effaced by time or worn away by water. The\r\nword _legionis_ has been shortened into LEGI, but the truncation of the\r\nI may be due to an accidental erasure. The inscription, which is easily\r\nread, is to the following effect:--_Deo Neptuno, C. Vitalinius\r\nVictorinus, miles legionis XXII., a curis, votum solvit libens merito._\r\nThe author, therefore, was a soldier of the twenty-second legion, Caius\r\nVitalinius Victorinus, who, having without doubt escaped shipwreck on\r\nthe lake, had vowed to raise an altar to Neptune, the god of the waves,\r\nand by a singular chance the whole stone of the Jura which testifies to\r\nthe fulfilment of his vow has been preserved by falling into the very\r\nwaters from which he was saved. Besides this altar stone, several other\r\nobjects have lately been found in the bed of the river; among them are\r\nthe upper part of a tin vase representing, in relief, Diana and\r\nEndymion, and a transparent stone cut in facets; the latter, if not\r\nfalse, will be highly interesting and valuable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAntiquarian Correspondence.\r\n\r\n                        Sin scire labores,\r\n    Quære, age: quærenti pagina nostra patet.\r\n\r\n     _All communications must be accompanied by the name and address of\r\n     the sender, not necessarily for publication._\r\n\r\n\r\nHERALDIC QUERY.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Can any of your readers kindly inform me what family bears or bore\r\nthe arms “Ermine, on a bend azure three lions rampant or”?\r\n\r\nT. J. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nISLE D’ECOSSE.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In Aytoun’s “Lays of the Scottish Cavaliers,” there is a ballad\r\nentitled the “Island of the Scots,” setting forth that in 1697, France\r\nand Germany being at war, an island in the Rhine, strongly garrisoned by\r\nGerman troops under General Stirke, was attacked and taken in a most\r\ngallant manner by a company of Scotsmen, exiles from their own country,\r\nand in the service of the King of France; and that this island has ever\r\nsince been known by the name of Isle d’Ecosse. Can you inform me where\r\nthis isle is situated, and where I can see a detailed account of the\r\nabove passage of arms? The isle, I may add, is not mentioned by Murray.\r\n\r\nR. M. B.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINING IN THE HOME COUNTIES.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In the Lansdowne MSS. (57, fol. 146) in the British Museum, may be\r\nseen a copy of a licence granted in December, 1588, by Queen Elizabeth,\r\nto one John Nicholls, for a term of six months, to dig for “mynes or\r\nmyneralls of golde, silver, tynne, or leade, hidden within the earth, in\r\nthe counties of Middlesex, Hertford, Buckingham, and Kent.” What\r\nsuccess may have attended his searches in the other counties I know not;\r\nbut as I searched in vain for any notice to the effect of a renewal of\r\nthe grant so far as concerns Hertfordshire, it is more than probable\r\nthat Master John Nicholls did not find “myning” a very profitable\r\noccupation in that county. Can any of your readers throw light upon the\r\nsubject?\r\n\r\nFOSSOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NAME OF FOSTAL.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Can you, or any of your readers, kindly assist me in throwing\r\nlight on the derivation of Fostal, a commonplace name in Kent? I believe\r\nthere are some dozen places bearing the name, but variously spelled as\r\nFostal, Fostalls, Forstals, and Forstalls. In Herne parish, not far from\r\nHerne Bay, there is a Fostall and Fostall Farm, and in Ospringe parish,\r\nnear Faversham, a place called Painter’s Forstal. Prof. Skeat, I\r\nbelieve, explains it as “Fore” and “Stall” (= Stead), a place in front\r\nof a farm (?). There are generally trees near at hand, and the people in\r\nthis locality connect the word with forest-alling and regrating--most\r\nabsurdly as I think.\r\n\r\nH. F. WOOLRYCH.\r\n\r\n_Oare Vicarage, Faversham_.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD, ARCHBISHOP OF MESSINA.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Can any of your readers give me some account of the Archbishop of\r\nMessina, an Englishman, the subject of the accompanying paragraph, which\r\nI have translated from an Italian paper, the _Italia_, of May 31:--\r\n\r\n“At the Villa Guzzi, near Messina, the interesting discovery has been\r\nmade of the sarcophagus of Richard, English Archbishop of Messina, who\r\ndied A.D. 1195. The sarcophagus is decorated with a bas-relief in the\r\nByzantine style, having for its subject, the Saviour seated; on His\r\nright is shown the Virgin Mary standing, whilst on His left is the\r\nArchbishop, likewise in a standing position. There is also an\r\ninscription on each corner.”\r\n\r\nThis account is meagre as far as it goes; and I should feel interested\r\nin learning something more about this English Archbishop of Messina.\r\n\r\nM. H. C.\r\n\r\n_Spezia, Italy._\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE SENTENCE OF PONTIUS PILATE.”\r\n\r\n(See vol. v. pp. 80, 217.)\r\n\r\nSIR,--Since writing the note at the second reference, I have ascertained\r\nthat the alleged death-warrant of Jesus Christ appeared in the _National\r\nMagazine_ (published in Liverpool) for Oct. 1877. In this version only\r\nthree names are appended to the sentence, and the phraseology is\r\nsomewhat different.\r\n\r\nBut what I wish to point out at present is the glaring contradictions\r\noccurring in the three copies before me as to the date of the finding of\r\nthis curiosity. According to the above-named magazine it was discovered\r\n“in the year 1825,” the _Catholic Fireside_ account says 1820, while\r\nyour version has “A.D. 1280.” May not the latter date be a misprint for\r\n1820? If not, were excavations in search of Roman antiquities made in\r\nNaples in the thirteenth century?\r\n\r\nP. J. MULLIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nHELSTON FURRY DANCE.\r\n\r\nSIR,--As the very interesting subject of the Helston Furry Day has been\r\nopened by Canon Boger (see vol. v. p. 251), may I add a few remarks on\r\nit?\r\n\r\n1. As to the term Floralia or Flora Day, except from a descriptive\r\nstandpoint I should demur to the theory that the Helston festival of May\r\n8 is a continuation or survival of the Roman Floralia, although some\r\npersons may favour that view. It is probably in origin purely Celtic,\r\nand is connected with the Roman Floral festival only in that it also\r\nexpresses the joy of May.\r\n\r\n2. The origin of the custom may be held to be “lost in remote antiquity”\r\nsolely in the sense that we cannot actually date its institution. The\r\nlocal legend relates that it was instituted in the middle ages as a\r\nrejoicing for the deliverance of Helston from the plague: a not\r\nimprobable solution of the Helston myth that here St. Michael overcame\r\nSatan, and forced him to drop the “Hell stone,” still seen in the “Angel\r\nyard.” The parish church is dedicated to St. Michael, and May 8 is, I\r\nbelieve, the feast of the apparition of St. Michael on St. Michael’s\r\nMount. It is not improbable that the deliverance of Helston from the\r\nplague was attributed to the patron of the town, _i.e._, St. Michael,\r\nwho overcame the demon of the plague.\r\n\r\n3. The Helston furry dance is a definite institution, unlike any other\r\ndance that I know. I do not know to what “various dances” Canon Boger\r\nrefers; probably to the ball in the evening, which, I believe, is\r\nconducted in the modern fashion.\r\n\r\n4. The ceremony is somewhat this: The party assemble at the Market\r\nHouse, the local aristocracy at 1 p.m. In 1883 there were thirty-one\r\ncouples of the gentry, this year there were thirty-two couples. The\r\ntradesmen’s dance at 4 p.m. was not quite so numerously supported as the\r\nupper class one. The volunteer band marches to the gate with three\r\njavelin men with lances crowned with flowers. At the appointed time the\r\nband strikes up the Celtic Furry tune. The dancers then proceed, two and\r\ntwo, pirouetting and changing partners at certain places. They go into\r\nthe houses, passing out of the back doors through the gardens, and then\r\nre-enter the houses from the back. As they leave the houses in some\r\nplaces they ring the bells. The effect is very singular, but to anyone\r\nfond of ancient customs is full of interest as a survival from mediæval\r\ntimes, and such a survival as could hardly have continued except in a\r\nremote part of England. Most of the Helston May customs belong to\r\nmediæval customs of Merrie England, _e.g._, the boughs outside the\r\nhouses, the procession dance (though most of our English May dances were\r\nheld round the May-pole), but the going in and out of the houses and\r\nalso the music of the Furry tune are distinctively Cornish.\r\n\r\nW. S. LACH-SZYRMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTS AND CHESTERS.\r\n\r\n(See _ante_, p. 47.)\r\n\r\nSIR,--I should not have thought it necessary to notice “A. H.’s”\r\nsingular effusion in your last number (see p. 47), but for the welcome\r\nillustration it affords of what Mr. Allen has so happily termed that\r\n“easy off-hand theory,” which “shirks all the real difficulties of the\r\nquestion” (_ante_, v. 286). In trying to pursue his own more searching\r\nand scholarly method of dealing with these “interesting philological\r\nfossils,” I am only too glad that those who despise this method as\r\n“word-twisting,” and prefer to leap at conclusions, should expound, as a\r\ncontrast, their views.\r\n\r\nAs to “A. H.’s” first point, it is based simply on mis-statements. I\r\nnever used the word “borrowed” myself. _My_ expression was:\r\n“_incorporated_ before the settlement” (_ante_, v. 286). Nor did I ever\r\nclaim any of these words as “_generically_ an English word,” or as\r\n“English forms of some Teutonic roots.” On the contrary, I gave “the\r\nLatin words” (v. 285) from which they were each _etymologically_\r\nderived. My contention was that they had become “distinctly English\r\nwords” by being\r\n\r\n     “Incorporated _before_ the settlement, into the tongue of the\r\n     English pirates, who brought with them, as part of their language,\r\n     the forms which they had thus constructed for themselves.”\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to put this as strongly as possible in order to\r\naccentuate the distinction. Thus, when “A. H.” speaks of “lamentable\r\nconfusion” (so well illustrated in his own letter), he is using\r\n“distinctly English words,” though they are derived from Latin\r\noriginals. If I, on the other hand, should say “_Naviget Anticyram_,” I\r\nshould be using distinctly Latin words. And, lastly, when “A. H.” seeks\r\nto “ramify” the “purport” of a paper (_ante_, p. 47), he is using an\r\nexpression unknown, I believe, to any language, living or dead.\r\n\r\nAs to the Welsh _caer_ or _kair_, I never said, or could have supposed,\r\nthat it was derived from the Latin _castrum_. I merely quoted Mr.\r\nAllen’s reminder that, on the departure of the Romans, this native form\r\nsupplanted theirs in place names, before the arrival of the English.\r\n_Ergo_, the erudition of “A. H.” is obviously _nihil ad rem_.\r\n\r\nAs to _port_, what we have to account for is not, as “A. H.” crudely\r\nimagines, “the modern word Port,” but the Anglo-Saxon _port_, which can\r\nbe conclusively shown to have been used _not_ in the sense of either\r\n_portus_ or _porta_, but of a market (or trading) town. Leicester and\r\nOxford were obviously not “ports” in our modern sense of the word, but\r\nthey _were_ “ports” in the Anglo-Saxon sense of it, and, as such, had a\r\n“portmanmote” for their governing body. We know, as I have shown, from\r\nDomesday, that Port Meadow, so-called from belonging to the town (or\r\n“_port_”) of Oxford, was in existence then as the town meadow. “Port\r\nMeadow at Oxford,” says Mr. Olifant (“Old and Middle English,” p. 78),\r\n“speaks of ... _port_, used by our pagan forefathers as a name for town;\r\nindeed, _port_ and _upland_ stood for _town_ and _country_.” To “Port\r\nMeadow” I may now add “Portmanseyt” (the _eyot_ of the Portmen or\r\nBurgesses), which stood near it in the river (“Calendar of Bodleian\r\nCharters,” p. 312), and also “two pieces of land and marsh-land\r\n_sometime called Portemarshe_ [cf. Portmeadow] and now being divided,\r\ncalled by the several names of the Easter Portemarche and the Wester\r\nPortemarche,” at Barnstaple, in 1610 (9th Rep. Hist. MSS. I. 214a).\r\n\r\n“A. H.” defiantly inquires, how “can the prefix [in Portway] be of\r\nEnglish origin, if it means ‘carry?’” But _I never said it did_, or\r\nindeed mentioned it at all. A far simpler explanation of the word would\r\nbe the “way” that led from one “port” to another.\r\n\r\nThe solution of “A. H.’s” irritation is of course to be found in his\r\neagerness to contend that “port” (in “port-reeve”) was “not introduced\r\nas a new English word, but preserved by Celto-Romans from Latin usage,”\r\nand that, consequently, “our Lord Mayor” can be traced through the\r\nPort-reeve to Roman times. This is the longed-for conclusion at which\r\n“A. H.” and Dr. Pring, though starting from opposite premisses, would\r\narrive with equal confidence, the “dead certainty” on which “A. H.” so\r\nnaturally dreads and so impatiently resents that discussion which it\r\ncannot stand.\r\n\r\nJ. H. ROUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nA BIBLIOGRAPHIC CURIOSITY.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In the _N. B. Advertiser and Ladies’ Journal_ for Jan. 12 is\r\npublished a long but interesting letter from a Dundee correspondent,\r\nsigning himself C. R. R., in which the writer makes known his discovery\r\nof the long-lost “lewd sang,” which was appended to an early edition of\r\nthe psalm-book known as the “Guid and Godlie Ballattes.” To those of\r\nyour readers south of the Tweed who take an interest in Scottish\r\nbibliography the following somewhat lengthy quotation from the letter\r\nmentioned can scarcely fail to be acceptable. I may remark further that\r\nDr. Laing’s reprint, therein referred to, was issued in 1868:--\r\n\r\nAbout thirty-five years ago the late Mr. Alexander Langlands, clerk in\r\nthe Dundee Bank, purchased at the sale of the _lares et penates_ of a\r\ndeceased teacher, for the sum of eightpence, a lot of literary scraps,\r\namong which the article about to be described was found, and which\r\nproved to be an imperfect copy of the “Guid and Godlie Ballattes.”\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Laing was engaged in the publication of his reprint, this was\r\nlent him, the price offered for its purchase being far below the rather\r\nextravagant value attached to it by its owner. It is evident the Doctor\r\nnever examined it very carefully; he states in a biographical note\r\nattached to his reprint that he had once had a fragment of a smaller\r\ncopy, but the leaves had fallen aside. The fact is, I think, pretty\r\nobvious that these leaves and the present copy were one and the same, as\r\ngreat difficulty was experienced by Mr. Langlands before it was\r\nreturned, and it was only restored by the intervention of a personal\r\nfriend of the Doctor’s after the lapse of many months; the gentleman’s\r\nname I do not feel at liberty to make public, but may say he has done\r\ngood work in connection with Wedderburn’s memory, and holds a high\r\nposition in a seat of learning. Mr. Langlands eventually parted with his\r\nvaluable leaves to their present possessor for a sum which was\r\nconsidered an extremely liberal one. Mr. Langlands soon after passed\r\nfrom the scene, full of years, leaving many attached friends behind.\r\n\r\nHerbert, in his edition of “Ames Typographical Antiquities,” part iii.\r\np. 1491, states “that a ‘Psalm Buik’ was printed at Edinburgh by Thomas\r\nBassendyne in 1568, at the end of which was printed ‘ane lewd sang,’\r\nentitled ‘Welcum Fortoun.’” The book was ordered by the General Assembly\r\nto be called in, the title to be altered, that the “lewd sang be\r\ndelete,” and the printer be subjected to penalties. No copy of the book\r\nor of the lewd song is now known to exist. (See also “Buik of the\r\nUniversall Kirk.”) Dr. Laing adds his testimony to Herbert’s assertions.\r\n\r\nThe fragment referred to is printed in the black letter, the letterpress\r\nmeasures 4½ inches by 2½ inches. It commences on folio 4, the leaves,\r\nnot the pages, being numbered, and by a printer’s error folio 112 is\r\nnumbered 113. The signs run from A to O in eights, sign P having four\r\nleaves which are not numbered. The first three leaves of sign A are\r\nlost, and folio 4 commences with some short prayers. These missing\r\nleaves were doubtless occupied by the title, probably a short address to\r\nthe reader, and the first portion of the above-mentioned prayers. Sign\r\nP 1 to 3 are occupied by a table, and on the obverse of P 4 is\r\nprinted--“With The Haill hundredth and Fyftie Psalmis of David,”\r\nSternhold and Hopkins’s Version. And beneath is the imprint\r\nthus--“Improntit at Edinburgh, be John Scot. Anno Do. 1567.” The reverse\r\ncontains some doxologies, and, having no catch-word, has a finished\r\nappearance. Whether the above is to be considered as the title-page for\r\nthe Psalms to follow, or as an advertisement for a separate book, I will\r\nnot presume to decide, but at that time such advertisements were not\r\ncommon. On the reverse of O 8 the long-lost song, entitled “Welcum\r\nFortoun,” is found, and is printed below. If ever the Scripture words,\r\n“Unto the pure all things are pure,” were applicable, it is in the\r\npresent case, for it could only be by a far-fetched innuendo or a\r\nspecious construing of words that the Assembly could have arrived at\r\ntheir decision and verdict. But I am rather inclined to think that the\r\nsin of the printer must have consisted more in the fact of his placing a\r\nsecular song in conjunction with sacred hymns, and the more especially\r\nwith the productions of the Divine Psalmist:--\r\n\r\nWELCUM FORTOUN.\r\n\r\n    Welcum Fortoun, welcum againe,\r\n    The day and hour I may weill blis,\r\n    Thou hes exilit all my paine,\r\n    Quhilk to my hart greit plesour is.\r\n\r\n    For I may say, that few men may,\r\n    Seing of paine I am ’trest,\r\n    I haif obtenit all my pay,\r\n    The lufe of hir that I lufe best.\r\n\r\n    I knaw nane sic as scho is one\r\n    Sa trew, sa kynde, sa luiffandlie,\r\n    Quhat suld I do and scho war gone;\r\n    Allace yet had I lever die.\r\n\r\n    To me scho is baith trew and kynde,\r\n    Worthie it war scho had the praise,\r\n    For na disdane in hir I find,\r\n    I pray to God I may hir pleis.\r\n\r\n    Quhen that I heir hir name exprest,\r\n    My hart for joy dois loup thairfoir;\r\n    Abufe all uther I lufe hir best,\r\n    Unto I die, quhat wald scho moir.\r\n\r\nThis unique edition, and certainly the earliest known, although I do not\r\nby any means consider it the first, in its contents other than the\r\nabove, agrees with Dr. Laing’s reprint, and I only regret that he should\r\nhave been removed by the grim tyrant demanding his heriot before the\r\ndiscovery was made. The fortunate owner of the precious brochure is\r\nPatrick Anderson, Esq., merchant, Dundee, who, by a curious coincidence,\r\nresides in the ancient home of Alexander Wedderburn, Town Clerk of\r\nDundee, and who entertained his sapient Majesty James VI., of\r\ntobacco-defaming notoriety, on his visit to Dundee in 1617.\r\n\r\n_Leith, N.B._\r\n\r\nP.

WILLIAM BECK, F.R.H.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnough has been written of the calamities of authors, the mishaps which\r\nhave befallen precious MSS., their unfortunate mistakes, their\r\nafflictions in many and various degrees of misery, but of their\r\nconsolations, of their happy stumbling on the clue to some historical\r\npuzzle, the accidental discovery of some fresh information on a\r\ntreasured subject, their reward in at last finding some long-sought\r\nfacts--of all this we have heard little or nothing. But something of\r\nsuch pleasure comes to most students; not so often as could be wished,\r\nperhaps, but possibly quite as frequently as is good for study. And such\r\ngood hap did I hold to have fallen to my lot, when, in the autumn of\r\n1882, I casually came across the announcement in a newspaper that a pair\r\nof gloves, once the property of Shakespeare, were on loan to the\r\nWorcester Industrial Exhibition then open, to illustrate the\r\noldest-established and yet the most considerable industry of the Fair\r\nCity. Gloves, and their connection with ceremonials now obsolete, and\r\ncustoms only blindly followed, had long before been a favourite subject\r\nof mine; and as I found how it led farther and farther afield into\r\nhistory, and how closely it touched our national life, it became\r\naltogether fascinating, and I was even then preparing for publication a\r\nbook upon it. If I held myself fortunate in chancing upon a reference to\r\nso interesting a relic, as these gloves promised to prove, still more\r\ncause did there seem for congratulation when a request to their owner\r\nfor further information led to their being most courteously entrusted to\r\nmy care to be photographed, and to my being furnished with the several\r\nfacts relating to their identity narrated on p. 122 of my “Gloves: their\r\nAnnals and Associations.” I “enthoozed” over these gloves not a little,\r\nwith no small reverence and half a hope that some reflected inspiration\r\nmight follow on what many people would regard as little short of\r\nsacrilege, I ventured to put them on my hands, holding myself in great\r\nmeasure excused by a very fair descent of them from the keeping of\r\nGarrick to their present possessor, and by the undoubted fact that they\r\nwere at least attributable to the period from which they were said to\r\ndate. They are, at any rate, relics of undoubted age and value, apart\r\nfrom any other considerations; not like those with which Mr. Black\r\ninvests “Judith Shakespeare,” in the novel with that title, now\r\nappearing in _Harper’s Magazine_. Here the young lady at one time wears,\r\ncorrectly and properly, a fine pair of gloves, scented and embroidered,\r\nthat her father had brought her from London, but when (on p. 541) one of\r\nher lovers has departed from her in dudgeon, she very prettily--for she\r\nis a charming young lady--looks “after him for a moment or two, as she\r\nfastened a glove button that had got loose.” This is very unfortunate,\r\nfor people did not wear buttoned gloves then, nor for a long time after,\r\nuntil it was desired to make them fit closely and display, rather than\r\nmerely cover, the hand, whereas it was the glove, and not the\r\nproportions of the hand, that was made most conspicuous in Shakespeare’s\r\nday.\r\n\r\nIn January of this year I received from Mr. Horace Howard Furness, of\r\nPhiladelphia, the eminent Shakespearian scholar, the following letter:--\r\n\r\n     SIR,--In a review of your admirable book in the _Spectator_ for\r\n     November 24, 1883, mention is made of a pair of Shakespeare’s\r\n     gloves now in the possession of Miss Benson, which the reviewer\r\n     states you incline “to consider genuine relics.” (I quote the\r\n     review and the reviewer, because I have not yet seen your book. I\r\n     ordered it from London through my bookseller some time ago, but it\r\n     has not yet arrived.)\r\n\r\n     Am I too bold in asking you to be kind enough, sometime at your\r\n     leisure, to send me some of the grounds on which you have reached\r\n     the conclusion that these gloves are those which were presented to\r\n     Garrick in 1769? For several years past I have flattered myself\r\n     that I was the fortunate owner of these gloves.\r\n\r\n     The pedigree of mine will be found--\r\n\r\n     First, in the letter of John Ward to Garrick in 1769. (See\r\n     Garrick’s “Correspondence, &c.,” vol. i. p. 352.)\r\n\r\n     Second, Mrs. Garrick’s bequest of them to Mrs. Siddons in her will\r\n     dated 1822. See Campbell’s “Life of Mrs. Siddons,” p. 369, where is\r\n     also to be found the formal note of Mrs. Garrick’s executors to\r\n     Mrs. Siddons, requesting an interview, for the purpose of\r\n     presenting these gloves to her.\r\n\r\n     Third, Mrs. Siddons’ bequest of these gloves to her daughter\r\n     Cecilia, Mrs. Geo. Combe, of Edinboro’.\r\n\r\n     Fourth, Mrs. Combe’s bequest of them to her cousin, Mrs. Fanny\r\n     Kemble.\r\n\r\n     Lastly, the gift of these gloves in the very box in which Mrs.\r\n     Siddons kept them, with her writing on the cover, “Shakespeare’s\r\n     Gloves, left by Mrs. Garrick to Sarah Siddons,” and by my dear and\r\n     venerated friend, Mrs. Kemble, to their present possessor.\r\n\r\n     At any rate these gloves of mine were once Garrick’s, Mrs.\r\n     Siddons’, and Mrs. Kemble’s. I am almost content to rest there.\r\n\r\n     Should it interest you, I will send you a photograph of them.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further, let us bring in evidence the extracts adduced\r\nto establish the authenticity of these gloves.\r\n\r\n(_Private Correspondence of David Garrick_, vol. i. p. 352.)\r\n\r\nMR. JOHN WARD[22] _to_ MR. GARRICK.\r\n\r\n_Leominster, May 31st, 1769._\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR,--On reading the newspapers, I find you are preparing a\r\n     grand jubilee, to be kept at Stratford-upon-Avon, to the memory of\r\n     the immortal Shakespeare. I have sent you a pair of gloves which\r\n     have often covered his hands. They were made me a present by a\r\n     descendant of the family, when myself and company went over there\r\n     from Warwick in the year 1746, to perform the play of “Othello” as\r\n     a benefit, for repairing his monument in the great church, which we\r\n     did gratis, the whole of the receipts being expended upon that\r\n     alone.\r\n\r\n     The person who gave them to me, William Shakespeare by name,\r\n     assured me his father had often declared to him they were the\r\n     identical gloves of our great poet, and when he delivered them to\r\n     me, said, “Sir, these are the only property that remains of our\r\n     famous relation; my father possessed, and sold the estate he left\r\n     behind him, and these are all the recompense I can make you for\r\n     this night’s performance.”\r\n\r\n     The donor was a glazier by trade, very old, and, to the best of my\r\n     memory, lived in the street leading from the Townhall down to the\r\n     river. On my coming to play in Stratford about three years after,\r\n     he was dead. The father of him and our poet were brothers’\r\n     children.\r\n\r\n     The veneration I bear to the memory of our great author and player\r\n     makes me wish to have these relics preserved to his immortal\r\n     memory, and I am led to think I cannot deposit them for that\r\n     purpose in the hands of any person so proper as our modern Roscius.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir,\r\nYour most obedient humble servant,\r\nJOHN WARD.[23]\r\n\r\n     P.S.--I shall be glad to hear you receive them safe, by a line\r\n     directed for me in the Bargate, Leominster, Herefordshire.\r\n\r\n     (_Campbell’s Life of Mrs. Siddons_, vol. ii. pp. 369-370.)\r\n\r\n     “The widow of Garrick died in 1822, at a venerable age. She made\r\n     the following bequest to the great actress, in a codicil to her\r\n     will, dated August 15, 1822:--\r\n\r\n     “I give to Mrs. Siddons a pair of gloves which were Shakespeare’s,\r\n     and were presented by one of his family to my late dear husband\r\n     during the jubilee at Stratford-upon-Avon.”\r\n\r\n     Information of the above reached Mrs. Siddons, with this note from\r\n     Mrs. Garrick’s executors:--\r\n\r\n“_5, Adelphi Terrace, Oct. 30, 1822._\r\n\r\n     “MADAM,--We beg leave to transmit to you the above extract from a\r\n     codicil to Mrs. Garrick’s will, and to acquaint you that we will\r\n     have the honour of waiting on you, for the purpose of delivering\r\n     the relic therein mentioned, whenever you may be so good as to\r\n     inform us that it may be convenient to you to receive our visit.\r\n\r\n“We remain, with much respect, Madam,\r\n“Your most obedient humble servants,\r\n“THOS. RACKETT, } Executors.”\r\n“G. F. BELTZ,   }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that we have not the knowledge which led the editor of\r\nGarrick’s “Correspondence” to underwrite Ward’s letter with such a pithy\r\npostscript, and very regrettable that he should not have been brought to\r\nbook for his pains, particularly as his name is not given on the\r\ntitle-page. The gloves, which may reasonably be referred to, bear, so\r\nfar as I can judge from the photograph with which Mr. Furness has since\r\nfavoured me, every mark of belonging to Shakespeare’s day, and were at\r\nany rate of some value, worth too much intrinsically to be lightly given\r\naway by an ordinary glazier; for, quoting the description of Mr.\r\nFurness, the embroidery upon them, “as well as the fringe is all in gold\r\nthread, still untarnished, the edging is of pink silk, which is\r\ncontinued in the inside, an inch and a half in width. They are about\r\nfourteen inches long, and six inches wide at the base of the gauntlet.”\r\n\r\nThere is no conflict of identity between these gloves and those pictured\r\nin my pages, for the latter are declared to have been given to Garrick\r\nby the Corporation of Stratford at the time of the Jubilee, in a finely\r\ncarved box of the mulberry tree planted by Shakespeare, and to have been\r\npresented by the widow of Garrick to the direct relative of Miss Benson,\r\nwho now holds them. It is very tantalising that I cannot find a precise\r\ntestimony to this gift in any account of the Jubilee, although a friend\r\nof mine has searched diligently in all the contemporary accounts and\r\ncounty histories that can be thought of. There was, however, undoubtedly\r\nsuch a presentation, for Foote, when Garrick produced “The Jubilee” as\r\nan attraction at Drury-lane, determined to burlesque that and his rival\r\ntogether. In this very practical jest, an actor intended to personate\r\nGarrick--bearing on his breast a pair of white gloves and other articles\r\npresented at the Jubilee--was to be addressed in the very words of the\r\npanegyric pronounced on Garrick at Stratford--\r\n\r\n    “A nation’s taste depends on you,\r\n     Perhaps a nation’s virtue too.”\r\n\r\nwhen Garrick’s counterfeit presentment was to flap his arms as though\r\nthey were wings, and crow--\r\n\r\n    “Cock-a-doodle-doodle-doo!”\r\n\r\nIt is pleasurable to write that this burlesque was never placed upon the\r\nstage, although Foote plainly had to be coerced into suppressing it, and\r\nwas not to be hindered from writing “A Satirical Account of the\r\nJubilee,” which may be found in the 39th vol. of the _Gentleman’s\r\nMagazine_, p. 458. There is also no doubt of the freedom of Stratford\r\nhaving been presented to Garrick in a box made from the famous mulberry\r\ntree, for the resolution of the Common Council of the borough conferring\r\nthis honour upon him particularly directs that it should be so conveyed\r\n(“Staffordshire and Warwickshire Past and Present,” vol. iii. p. 116).\r\n\r\nThe friend to whom I have already acknowledged my deep indebtedness in\r\nthis quest, sends me from West’s “History of Warwickshire” trace of yet\r\nanother pair of gloves associated, at least traditionally, with the\r\nPrince of Poets, and long kept on view in Anne Hathaway’s cottage at\r\nShottery. There were several such articles there, and among them “a\r\n_chair_, termed ‘Shakespeare’s courting chair,’ a _purse_ about four\r\ninches square, wrought with white and black bugles and beads; a small\r\ninkstand, and a _pair of fringed gloves_. These articles were said to\r\nhave been handed down from Shakespeare to his grand-daughter _Lady\r\nBarnard_, and from her through the Hathaway family to those of the\r\npresent day. Influenced by the currency of this tradition, Mr. _Ireland_\r\npurchased the former two articles, and Mr. _George Garrick_ the latter.”\r\nHere again, however, we find a discordant doubt expressed, for the\r\nwriter continues, “but these reliques will not bear examination. It will\r\nbe uniformly found, by those who make enquiries, without an effort at\r\nself-deception, _that there is not a single article of any nature\r\nextant_ that has been proved to have belonged to Shakespeare. There is\r\nat present a bedstead with massive pillars, shewn as having belonged to\r\nAnne Hathaway, but we consider it in character with the articles\r\nattributed to Shakespeare.”\r\n\r\nThis scepticism and disbelief is doubtless honest enough, but it is\r\ncertainly too sweeping. These latter gloves are not now, within my\r\nknowledge, in existence; as for the other two pairs I leave your readers\r\nto judge whether these remarks apply to them, or whether one, or both,\r\nmay not be fairly considered to be hallowed by the associations claimed\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dignity of a Mayor; or, Municipal Insignia of Office.\r\n\r\nBY R. S. FERGUSON, F.S.A., MAYOR OF CARLISLE 1881-2 AND 1882-3.\r\n\r\n_PART II._\r\n\r\n(_Continued from p. 71._)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ordinary shape of a great mace is well known, and needs little\r\ndescription. A shaft and a bell-like head; on the base of the bell are\r\nthe royal arms, and the bell is ornamented by an open-arched crown with\r\norb and cross on the top. The sides of the bell are divided into four\r\ncompartments by demi-female figures; and the rose, thistle, harp, and\r\nfleur-de-lis, each occupies a compartment, and is crowned. The shaft is\r\ndivided into stages, and flying supports occur beneath the bell, and the\r\nshaft and base are covered with foliage. The heads frequently unscrew,\r\nand form loving cups. At Beaumaris the bells of the two maces contain\r\ndrinking cups, and at Pwllheli the mace is nothing else but a\r\ntwo-handled drinking cup, with an oak pole stuck up its hollow foot.\r\n\r\nThe sergeants’ maces are simpler in form, and the crown is a mere open\r\ncircle of fleur-de-lis and crosses.\r\n\r\nAt Nottingham the sheriff has a mace, and at one or two places there are\r\nmaces for the mayoress.\r\n\r\nWhen the Crown visits a town, the mayor should give up his staff of\r\noffice to the king, or queen, and himself bear the mace before his\r\nsovereign. At Coventry, when William III. visited that city, the mayor\r\ncarried the mace and an alderman the sword. To a royal personage other\r\nthan his sovereign, the staff should not be given up, unless that\r\npersonage be there to represent the sovereign, but the mayor should\r\ncarry the mace. In 1503 the Lord Mayor of York himself carried the mace\r\nbefore the Princess Margaret. On the occasion of royal visits to the\r\nCity of London, the Lord Mayor tenders to the sovereign his jewelled\r\nsceptre. Sometimes the mace itself is given up to the sovereign, as at\r\nStafford, where the mayor kissed the mace and handed it to James I., who\r\nadmired it greatly, and then returned it. At Cambridge the mayor\r\ndelivered his mace to Queen Anne, who did the like.\r\n\r\nMany corporations, in addition to their maces, possess swords of state\r\nor honour. According to the best authorities, the oldest symbols of\r\nmunicipal powers were the sword and the dragon, both of Roman origin,\r\nthe one being the cohortal ensign of the Romans, the other the insignia\r\nof Supreme Justice.\r\n\r\n     “At Amiens (says Dr. Thompson in his Eng. Mun. Hist.), the insignia\r\n     of Supreme Justice consisted of two swords of antique shape,\r\n     carried in the hands of two officials, and a similar custom\r\n     prevailed among almost all the great Corporations of France, which\r\n     undoubtedly had a continuity from Roman time.”\r\n\r\nThe sword, then, is the symbol of criminal jurisdiction, as the mace is\r\nof civil. The County Palatinate of Chester had a state sword, which is\r\nfigured in the Visitation of that county in 1580, published by the\r\nHarleian Society; while the Bishop of Durham, so long as he was a\r\ntemporal power and had criminal jurisdiction, was presented with a sword\r\non taking possession of his see.\r\n\r\nThe right to have a sword borne before a mayor was originally conferred\r\neither by charter, which may often have merely confirmed a previous\r\npractice, or by a royal present of a sword. Thus James I. gave the City\r\nof Canterbury a sword to be borne before the mayor. Hull has two swords,\r\none given by Henry VIII., the other by Charles I. The authorities of\r\nCarlisle purchased a “Sword of Honour” in 1635-6 for £4 13s. The blade\r\nat least was second-hand, for it bears the date of 1509, and was made at\r\nMilan. The authority to bear it was given by royal charter in 1637, but\r\nit was probably purchased in London by a deputation who went there to\r\narrange about procuring the charter. On the locket of the sheath is cut\r\nthe letter S in great size, and I have never found a satisfactory\r\naccount of what it means, unless it stands for sword. Our governing\r\ncharter at Carlisle gives us the right to have a sword by authorising us\r\nto have an official “qui erit et vocabitur Portator Gladii nostri coram\r\nMayore Civitatis prædictæ.”\r\n\r\nThe grant by charter of a sword differs in various places: at King’s\r\nLynn the sword is to be sheathed, at Chester it is to be borne before\r\nthe mayor “in our absence,” and point upright. I take it that the sword\r\nshould always be point upright, and that the Corporations of London and\r\nYork are wrong in putting it on their achievements of arms with the\r\npoint down. I take it, it should never be lowered but in the presence\r\nof the Crown. The swords are generally sheathed, but the sword at Great\r\nYarmouth is carried unsheathed in time of a European war. At Lichfield a\r\nsword is kept permanently fixed over the mayor’s pew, and sheathed, but\r\nthe sheath is withdrawn when the mayor attends church. At Carmarthen the\r\nsword, by charter of Henry VIII., is ordered to be “freely and lawfully”\r\nborne before the “said mayor in manner as is accustomed to be done in\r\nour City of London.” A curious story comes from Coventry, that in 1384\r\nthe sword was carried behind the mayor because he had not done justice.\r\nThe Corporation of Chester and the dean and chapter of that place fell\r\nout about the sword; the ecclesiastics objected to the mayor bringing\r\nhis sword to church, but it was decided that\r\n\r\n     “As often as the mayor repaired to the church to hear divine\r\n     service or sermon, or upon any just occasion, he was to be at\r\n     liberty to have the sword of the city borne before him with the\r\n     point upwards.”\r\n\r\nThe information I have before me only furnishes the names of five places\r\nas having CAPS OF ESTATE OR MAINTENANCE, namely, London, York, Coventry,\r\nExeter, and Waterford. They are generally worn by the swordbearer, and I\r\nimagine that many more places than I have mentioned provide their\r\nswordbearers with fur coverings for their heads; but it is not to be\r\ntaken for granted that every fancy hat, whether of fur or not, worn by a\r\nswordbearer is a CAP OF MAINTENANCE. Gwillim defines a cap of\r\nmaintenance as a cap of dignity, worn by dukes in token of good\r\ngovernment and freedom. Planché makes it the same as the “Abacot,” a cap\r\nworn during the fourteenth, fifteenth, and commencement of the sixteenth\r\ncenturies by royal and noble personages, varying in form, and ultimately\r\ntaking a shape not unlike a Glengarry cap, made of crimson velvet and\r\nlined with ermine, and occasionally placed by heralds beneath crests\r\ninstead of the ordinary wreath. It appears of that shape as a crest to\r\nthe arms of the City of York, but at London, both in the armorial\r\nbearings and on the swordbearer’s head, it is of fur, of the shape of an\r\ninverted flower-pot. At Coventry it is also of fur, and round, while at\r\nExeter I believe it is of red velvet. The history of this is known: it\r\nwas presented to the City of Exeter by Henry VII., and was worn by the\r\nswordbearer until lately, when, on the suggestion of Mr. Tucker\r\n(Somerset Herald), it was ordered to be carried before the mayor on a\r\ncushion. I do not know the history of the other fur caps of maintenance\r\nI have enumerated. If I did I might be able to throw some light on the\r\nmatter, but I own to being a little in the dark as to caps of\r\nmaintenance. If, as Gwillim says, the cap of maintenance is a mark of\r\nfreedom, its association with the swordbearer (the sword denoting\r\ncriminal jurisdiction) may mean freedom from all extraneous criminal\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIf this is so, I would suggest to the powers that be to lay down the\r\nfollowing rules:--\r\n\r\n     That every mayor may and should have a mace; the mayor of a borough\r\n     with a separate commission of the peace--a mace and a sword. If, in\r\n     addition, his borough has quarter sessions of its own, then he\r\n     should also have a cap of maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe Corporations of Colchester, Dover, Southampton, Norwich, Beaumaris,\r\nPreston, Great Yarmouth, Poole, Rochester, Boston, Waterford, &c.,\r\npossess SILVER OARS, the symbol of the maritime jurisdiction once\r\nenjoyed by those places, but abolished by the Act of 1840, placing all\r\ncreeks and rivers in Great Britain under the High Court of Admiralty.\r\nThe origin of this symbol is not known, but it is a natural one, and is,\r\nor was [for the Court is merged, I suppose, into the High Court of\r\nJustice] the badge or mace of the High Court of Admiralty, and was laid\r\nbefore the Judge, as the great mace used to be laid before the\r\nChancellor, when he presided in Chancery. The one belonging to the High\r\nCourt of Admiralty is said to be 130 years old, but an older one with\r\nthe arms of Queen Elizabeth thereon was once in existence. That\r\nbelonging to the Admiralty of the Cinque Ports is older still. One\r\nbelongs to the Governor of Bermuda, who has Admiralty jurisdiction.\r\nThese civic oars, like the maces, divide into two classes: large ones,\r\nlike that formerly at Boston, or that now at Great Yarmouth, meant to be\r\ncarried as maces before the mayor; small ones, as at Colchester and\r\nDover, the badges of authority of the water-bailiffs, who showed them,\r\nwhen executing process, as the sergeants-at-mace did their maces. That\r\nat Dover is 6 in. long, and is contained in a brass cylindrical box. The\r\nColchester one is 10 in. The one which was sold by Boston in 1832 is 3\r\nft. 3 in. long, and was carried as a mace; it is of the date of Queen\r\nElizabeth, and is now in the possession of Lord Brownlow. That at\r\nYarmouth is 4 ft. long, and has the Royal arms and those of the borough\r\non the blade. It was presented in 1745, and is of silver gilt. It is\r\ncarried before the mayor and behind the maces. Rochester possesses both\r\na great and small silver oar.\r\n\r\nMuch information as to silver oars will be found in the 30th and 31st\r\nvolumes of the Institute’s Journal.\r\n\r\nBy far the greatest part of the chains and badges worn by mayors are\r\nmodern, of various degrees of ugliness, and I certainly hope the\r\nantiquaries of a future age will not judge of the art of the nineteenth\r\ncentury from a collection of mayors’ chains. There are exceptions, such\r\nas the chain presented to Exeter by the Institute in 1874, which\r\nconsists of sixteen main links, conjoined by small ones. Of the former,\r\neight are castles, an idea taken from the arms of the city; seven are\r\ncomposed of the letter X, surmounted by a crown; the sixteenth is a\r\ncinquefoil, containing a representation of the hat presented to the\r\nmayor by Henry VII., and from the cinquefoil depends the badge on which\r\nis, in enamel, the arms of the city.\r\n\r\nI do not know that a mayor’s chain and badge has any particular\r\nsymbolism; I do not think that it is in the nature of a “collar.” It\r\nmerely marks out its wearer as a man of importance, and requires no\r\nspecial authority to authorise its assumption. It is part of the idea of\r\na mayor, inherent in him. But I must protest against some municipalities\r\nwhich have, without any right whatever, provided their mayors with\r\ncollars of SS. The Lord Mayor of Dublin wears one, but the collar was\r\ngiven to the city by Charles II., so there is no doubt as to his right\r\nto wear it; but I think the Lord Mayor of London would find great\r\ndifficulty in satisfying the College of Arms as to his right to a collar\r\nof SS, which was given him (temp. Henry VIII.), not by the Crown, but by\r\na subject, Sir John Alleyne. The town council of Cork coolly ordered a\r\n_fac-simile_ of the Dublin one to be provided for their mayor. The\r\ncouncil of Derby purchased Lord Denman’s collar of SS, and their mayor\r\nwears it. Coventry, Nottingham, Stamford, Kingston-on-Thames, and other\r\nplaces possess modern chains of the “SS pattern,” as the jewellers call\r\nit, and their mayors wear them. They might with equal propriety assume\r\nthe insignia of the Order of the Garter.\r\n\r\nThe use of chains is not confined to mayors; several other civic\r\ndignitaries wear them--sheriffs, and aldermen in some instances. York\r\nprovides a gold chain for its Lady Mayoress, and is ungallant enough to\r\nweigh the chain when it is handed to a new Lady Mayoress, and again when\r\nshe gives it up; an old scandal asserts that a former Lady Mayoress\r\nappropriated some of the links. Hull, which, by the way, possesses a\r\nmayor’s chain of the date of 1564, sold its Mayoress’s chain. At many\r\ntowns the waits, or town musicians, had badges with chains for\r\nsuspension: these are generally of silver, and the badges bear the arms\r\nof the place. Several curious examples exist. Lincoln has a mayor’s\r\nring, but whether it is ancient or not I do not know, nor do I know of\r\nany other place.\r\n\r\nAs to civic robes, I can give no information and lay down no rules. The\r\nmayor of Carlisle is one of the few mayors who possess no robe, and I\r\nrather congratulate myself thereon. I was utterly unprepared for the\r\ngorgeous spectacle presented by my brother mayors at the Mansion House\r\nin 1882. Every variety of material, of colour, and of pattern was to be\r\nseen that the wildest imagination of the tailor could devise.\r\n\r\nAlthough the mayor of Carlisle has no gown, the unreformed corporation\r\nof Carlisle had them in the seventeenth century, as shown by the records\r\nof a Court Leet, held on Monday, October 22, 1649:--\r\n\r\n     “We order (that according to an ancient order) the Aldermen of this\r\n     Citty shall attend the Maior upon every Lord’s day to the Church in\r\n     their gounes, and likewise to attend the Maior in the Markett-place\r\n     at or before the sermon bell to the Church, _sub pena_ vi_s_.\r\n     viii_d_. _toties quoties_; and the Common Counsellmen to attend\r\n     likewise, _sub pena_ 3s. 4d. _toties quoties_.\r\n\r\n     “We order that the present bailiffes of this Cittie shall forthwith\r\n     provide for either of them a decent gowne for the Honnor of this\r\n     Cittie, _sub pena_.”\r\n\r\nThe lateness of the hour warns me to stop. I daresay many of you think I\r\nhave been but wasting the evening in gossip over trivial matters. “But,”\r\nas Mr. Thompson writes, in his “English Municipal History,”--\r\n\r\n     “The citizen of olden times looked upon the municipal insignia with\r\n     a _political_ significance. When he saw the mace and sword, when he\r\n     saw the banner of his community unfurled, his heart exulted at the\r\n     thought that his fellow-citizens and he constituted a body enjoying\r\n     entire independence, their own civil and criminal jurisdiction, and\r\n     a name in the land which kings and lords respected.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Name and Office of Port-Reeve.\r\n\r\nBY JAMES HURLY PRING, M.D.\r\n\r\n_PART II._\r\n\r\n(_Continued from Vol. IV. p. 266._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe transference of the significance of words beyond the scope to which\r\nit was originally applied, is so obvious and generally recognised a\r\nfact, that I did not consider it necessary to insist more particularly\r\nupon it in my former paper.\r\n\r\nMany of your readers would doubtless be able to call to mind numerous\r\nexamples of the kind, and, indeed, I did not credit any of them with\r\nbeing unacquainted with so common and notorious a fact, and one which\r\nsuggests itself so readily in the instance of the word _port_ which was\r\nthe word here specially under discussion.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, under the circumstances, be well to call attention to\r\nthat very remarkable instance of the kind which has been made familiar\r\nto us by Mr. Isaac Taylor, in his “Words and Places.” He states (p. 309)\r\nthat “on the Mons Palatinus--a name the etymology of which carries us\r\nback to the time when the sheep were bleating on the slope--was the\r\nresidence of the Roman emperors, which, from the site, was called\r\nPalati(n)um, or Palatium. Hence the word PALACE has come to be applied\r\nto all royal and imperial residences.” And he goes on to observe, that\r\n“it is one of the curiosities of language that a petty hill-slope in\r\nItaly should have thus transferred its name to a hero of romance, to a\r\nGerman State, to three English counties, to a glass-house at Sydenham,\r\nand to all the royal residences in Europe.” The example thus cited is\r\ndoubtless very marked and extreme of its kind, very different in this\r\nrespect to the easy and obvious transference of the word _port_ to a\r\ncity enclosed within _gates_, the contracted word _port_ itself being\r\nderived from the Latin _porta_, a city-gate.\r\n\r\nWhen indeed it is considered that, like other Roman towns, each of the\r\nnumerous cities or towns of Roman Britain which subsequently became a\r\nSaxon burh or borough was empowered not only to collect tolls in respect\r\nof the objects actually sold at its gates, but also (as at present in\r\nContinental towns) to levy octroi (_ansaria_) on all provisions and\r\nwares brought within the gates for subsequent sale at the markets (the\r\n_Fora venalia_) inside, it is easy to understand not only how such towns\r\nspeedily came to acquire a mercantile character, but also how the word\r\n_port_, originally restricted to the gates where such extensive\r\ntransactions were carried on, would at no distant period become applied\r\nalso to the town itself.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the learned Professor Stubbs, now Bishop of Chester,\r\nderives the word _port_ from _porta_, as referring to “a mart or city of\r\nmerchants,” it is only reasonable to suppose that the recognition of\r\nthis change was present to his mind, and that he had in view that\r\nadvanced period in Saxon times when the word port had already become\r\ntransferred from the gates themselves to the town which was enclosed\r\nwithin them, and was apparently applied indifferently to either. But\r\nhowever this may be, we may at least be absolutely assured that he never\r\nintended to imply that _porta_, which carries us back to the original\r\nderivation, _a portando aratrum_, did not primarily and originally mean\r\na city-gate.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to follow Mr. Round through all his erratic\r\ncriticisms of my paper. The greater part of them may safely be left to\r\nthe discretion of your readers; at the same time, the want of candour by\r\nwhich some of his remarks are characterised, will not fail to be noted.\r\nThus, for example, when he dilates upon the occurrence of the word\r\n“underlying,” instead of “unlying,” in my reference to the Laws of\r\nAthelstan, everyone will at once perceive that this accidental error of\r\ntranscription (for which I cannot account) is at least quite immaterial\r\nto the point at issue, which turns entirely upon and is wholly centred\r\nin the question of the signification of the word _port_. It is to an\r\nexamination, therefore, of Mr. Round’s strictures on my use of this word\r\n_port_ that I shall now advert.\r\n\r\nMr. Round objects to the use of the word _port_ as synonymous with\r\n_gate_ where it occurs in the words “out of _port_,” or as I have\r\nrendered it “outside the port,” in the Laws of Athelstan; he rejects the\r\nidentification with or derivation from _porta_, of the word “port,” as\r\ninsisted on by Professor Stubbs, and he limits the word _port_ to mean\r\nonly “a market or trading town,” totally discarding the notion of its\r\nhaving anything whatever to do with “a gate.”\r\n\r\nAnd first, as Mr. Round asserts that my rendering “outside the _port_ or\r\n_gate_” “is a mere gloss of my own on the word _port_,” perhaps he will\r\nbe good enough to tell us in what light he regards the instance which he\r\nhimself adduces of “New_port_ gate in Lincoln”? Would he in this case,\r\naccording to his own rule, have the word _port_ rendered New\r\n_market-town_ gate? Again, in the case of the “Port of East-gate,”\r\n(_portam de East Gatâ_,) to which reference is made in the Charter of\r\nHenry I. to Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln, it is quite manifest that\r\nhere, as indeed in Newport gate, the Anglo-Saxon “geat,” on which Mr.\r\nRound dwells so fondly, is nothing more than the frequently observed\r\nreduplication of synonyms,[24] caused in this instance by the Saxons\r\naffixing this additional name of their own to the object, which under\r\nthe Roman name of port or porta conveyed to them no intelligible\r\nsignification. When, therefore, Mr. Round stigmatises my “rendering\r\noutside the port or gate” as “a mere ‘gloss’ of my own on the word\r\nport,” he must surely have overlooked these and similar instances in\r\nwhich the word _port_ is used synonymously with _gate_, and more\r\nespecially the fact that precisely the same rendering of the word\r\n_port_ was given nearly three hundred years ago by no less an authority\r\nthan Camden. Referring to the great Roman wall, Camden states that the\r\n“two forts called Castle steeds are to be seen in the wall, and then a\r\nplace called _Port-gate_[25] where (as the word in both languages fairly\r\nevinces) there was formerly _a Gate_ (or sally-_port_) through it.[26]”\r\n\r\nAnd here if we take the word sally-_port_ thus presented to us, and I\r\nmay add to this also the word _port_-cullis, there are few, I apprehend,\r\nexcept Mr. Round, who would contend that in these instances the word\r\n_port_ means a “market town,” and has no reference to “a gate.” Even in\r\nthe case of the actual word _port-reeve_ itself, Sharon Turner is found\r\ngiving the word “port” its true meaning when he explicitly states that\r\n“the _port_-gerefa, or the gerefa of the _gate_, was witness to all\r\npurchases without the _gate_”[27] thus in fact showing how this eminent\r\nSaxon historian and scholar read and understood the passage in the Laws\r\nof Athelstan. Numerous examples of the same kind might easily be\r\nadduced, and I might refer to those given in my former paper, which,\r\nlike the common occurrence of the term _extra portam_, and similar\r\nillustrations of the use of _porta_, Mr. Round seems to have found it\r\nconvenient to ignore. It is needless, however, to multiply further\r\ninstances to the same effect.\r\n\r\nMr. Round next proceeds to point out that “the markets were held in the\r\n_forum_,” “that we should consequently expect the name of a market town\r\nto be derived from _forum_ rather than from _porta_,” and that the\r\n“_forum_ so far from being at the gate (_porta_) was unquestionably in\r\nthe very centre of the settlement,” and that “as the markets were in no\r\nsense held at the _porta_, we are precluded from deriving port from\r\n_porta_”! This unique and somewhat anomalous specimen of argument,\r\ntogether with the unnecessary piece of information as regards the\r\nrelative situation of the forum and the _porta_, which Mr. Round feels\r\n“compelled” to point out in order to correct the error of Professor\r\nStubbs “in identifying ‘port’ with the Latin _porta_,” may all be\r\nconfidently remitted to the just discrimination of your readers. I\r\nwould, however, observe with respect to Mr. Round’s remarks on the\r\nposition of the forum, that it was scarcely necessary for him to go to\r\nSilchester and to Cilurnum in exemplification of the well-known fact\r\nthat the forum was situated in the centre of a Roman town or city. This\r\nfact, indeed, is even now amply attested by the lines of conformation\r\ndiscoverable in many of our old borough towns, of which Taunton itself,\r\nthe town from which I write, affords a very apt and striking\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nI think it well here to state that the foregoing observations were\r\nwritten in reply to Mr. Round’s first paper, but it was deemed advisable\r\nto defer their publication until after the appearance of a second\r\npromised paper, in which Mr. Round undertook to prove that port in\r\nPort-reeve was derived from _portus_, and not from _porta_, and stated\r\nthat he would offer “a most satisfactory explanation,” which would\r\n“completely justify us in accepting the _portus_ derivation.” Now,\r\nhowever, that the second paper has appeared, it would seem that he must\r\nhave found the handling of this “_portus_ derivation” a more awkward\r\nbusiness than he had anticipated, for the result is that he abandons it\r\naltogether, and arrives at the conclusion that the Romans could never\r\n“have called an inland town a _portus_,” nor in his opinion “_a porta_”\r\neither!\r\n\r\nHaving thus made a summary despatch of this “most satisfactory\r\nderivation,” Mr. Round next shifts his ground _in toto_, and calls on us\r\nin his second paper to accept a new theory of his own, which he is about\r\nto propound, and by which he “claims _port_ as an English word, in\r\nitself distinct from the Latin words _Porta_ and _Portus_.” Whether he\r\nwill be more successful with this new “theory” than he has been with his\r\nunfortunate “_portus_ derivation” we are to be left in uncertainty until\r\nthe appearance of his third paper. In the meantime, if in claiming port\r\nas an English word Mr. Round means an Anglo-Saxon word, I would observe\r\nI am aware of its occurrence in Lye’s “Anglo-Saxon Dictionary” (fol.,\r\nvol. ii.), where we find “Port, a port. Portus. To tham porte, ad\r\nportum, Bed. 4. I. Civitas. Oppidum. Into tham porte. In civitatem;\r\nÆlfr. Gr. c. 5. Potius tamen, _Porta_ civitatis vel oppidi.” Thus, then,\r\nwe see _port_ even here referred back to _porta_, a city-gate, as the\r\nsource of its original and most accurate derivation or meaning.\r\n\r\nIt seems somewhat strange, amid the great uncertainty attending his own\r\nviews, as shown by the variety of derivations which he has proposed,\r\nthat Mr. Round should have failed to avail himself of the opportunity\r\nafforded him by the Celtic. In the excellent dictionary, the “Antiquæ\r\nLinguæ Britannicæ Thesaurus,” by the Rev. T. Richards, we find “Porth, a\r\ndoor, a porch, a haven,” and we learn that the same word exists in the\r\nArmoric. I am quite aware of the great similarity, or as it has been\r\ntermed “the cognate character,” of many Celtic and Latin words, but\r\nnotwithstanding this knowledge, and all that Mr. Round has also advanced\r\non the subject, I would still maintain, in the instance of port-reeve,\r\nthe usually adopted derivation of _port_ from the Latin _porta_.\r\n\r\nAll notice has likewise been omitted by Mr. Round of the word _port\r\nway_, and the customarily accepted Roman significance attaching to it,\r\nand also of the common words _porter_ (a door-keeper), and _portal_, the\r\nderivation of which is, I believe, universally referred to the Latin\r\n_porta_.\r\n\r\nThe July number of THE ANTIQUARIAN MAGAZINE has now brought us Mr.\r\nRound’s third paper. Instead, however, of its containing, as we had been\r\nled to expect, some more fully developed account of his “natural and\r\nintelligible process by which the English word _port_ was formed,” and\r\nsome evidence in proof of his strange and as yet unsupported assertion\r\nthat the word _port_ was originally “coined by the English,” we find\r\nthat he merely reverts to a further consideration of the word _port_,\r\ntouching on the question of Newport gate, and barely alluding to the\r\nWelsh _porth_, two points to which it will be observed that I have here\r\njust adverted somewhat more fully.\r\n\r\nI now apprehend that I have been mistaken, but must confess that it\r\nnever occurred to me that Mr. Round’s conjecture in his second paper as\r\nto the manner in which the minds of “the English pirates” would be\r\nlikely to be affected by the word _portus_, was all he meant to tell us\r\nrespecting “the natural and intelligible process by which the English\r\nword _port_ was formed,” or that he could seriously propose to put\r\nforward this crude assumption of his own for general acceptance on a\r\nquestion of this kind.\r\n\r\nMr. Round’s observations in his third paper are not of a character to\r\nmake it necessary for me in any way to alter or modify anything that I\r\nhave already said. Indeed, so far as his introduction of the authority\r\nof Mr. Freeman is concerned, he has contributed only to strengthen my\r\nposition, for the passage which he quotes from Mr. Freeman’s “English\r\nTowns and Districts,” (a work which I have not enjoyed the advantage of\r\nseeing,) may, _mutatis mutandis_, be equally well applied to the word\r\nport-reeve.\r\n\r\nIf we merely substitute the word _port_ for “name of the gate,” and _in\r\nPort-reeve_ for “Nova Porta,” the sentence will read thus: “The abiding\r\nLatin port, in port-reeve, of itself goes far to show that there could\r\nhave been no long gap between Roman or British and English occupation.”\r\nWith this slight and quite legitimate alteration, (for the whole force\r\nof Mr. Freeman’s statement hangs on the presence of the word _porta_,)\r\nit would be difficult to express the point for which I have been\r\ncontending in more apposite terms, and the circumstance that Mr. Round\r\nsees fit to question Mr. Freeman’s statement because _he_ can “find no\r\nevidence for it,” is a matter regarding which I do not feel myself\r\ncalled upon to enter.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Round now informs us that his paper is “to be continued,” and it\r\nappears to be uncertain when it will be brought to a conclusion, I deem\r\nit best no longer to defer forwarding this reply, more especially as he\r\nproposes to make some other words, with which I do not find myself in\r\nany way concerned, the subject of his future criticisms.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would observe that the result of my former paper was to\r\nbring me many interesting communications on the subject of which it\r\ntreats.\r\n\r\nFrom the general tenor of these communications, as well as from other\r\nsources, I gather that the ancient office of port-reeve is rapidly\r\nfalling into desuetude, though in some comparatively rare instances the\r\nPort-reeve still remains the chief officer of the borough, and is\r\ninvested with considerable power and privileges. Thus, in an obliging\r\ncommunication which I received from the Port-Reeve of Tavistock, that\r\ngentleman is good enough to inform me that he not only still remains the\r\nreturning officer of the borough, but that he also enjoys a seat on the\r\nCounty Bench, as J.P. for Devon, solely by right and in virtue of his\r\noffice as Port-reeve, a fact which I conceive is sufficiently rare and\r\ninteresting to merit being placed on record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Salic Law.\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES MACKAY, LL.D., _Author of “The Gaelic Etymology of the\r\nLanguages of Western Europe.”_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Salic law, which still prevails in some parts of Europe, is supposed\r\nto have been instituted in the sixth century by Clovis, or Pharamond,\r\nKing of the Franks. In Shakespeare’s play of “King Henry V.,” Act i.\r\nScene 2, King Henry, addressing the Archbishop of Canterbury and the\r\nBishop of Ely, thus asks them to expound the Salic Law:--\r\n\r\n    “My learned Lord, we pray you to proceed:\r\n     And justly and religiously unfold,\r\n     Why the law Salique, that they have in France\r\n     Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim.”\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury in his reply mentions the ancient tradition\r\nthat this law was instituted by Pharamond, and continues:--\r\n\r\n    “The land Salique is in Germany,\r\n     Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe,\r\n     Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,\r\n     There left behind and settled certain French;\r\n     Who, holding in disdain the German women,\r\n     In some dishonest manners of their life,\r\n     Established then this law--to wit, no female\r\n     Should be inheritrix in Salique land.”\r\n\r\nThe very prosy speech of the Archbishop, from which this is an extract,\r\nbears no trace of the fine hand of Shakespeare, and was copied almost\r\n_verbatim_ from Holinshed.\r\n\r\nPresident Henault, borrowing from previous writers--who wrote from\r\ntradition, without adequate proof or authority for the statements they\r\nmade or adopted--says that it was Clovis who instituted and signed the\r\nSalic Law in A.D. 511, the year of his death. Voltaire says that Clovis\r\ncould neither read nor write, and that it is uncertain whether his name\r\nwas Clovis, Clodvic, or Hildovic. Voltaire states also that there are\r\ntwo versions of the text of this Salic Law, each of which differs from\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThough the word _Salic_ is by no means uncertain in its meaning, its\r\netymology is so very obscure and undecided as to have puzzled all the\r\nFrench, German, and English philologists who have flourished since the\r\ninvention of printing. According to Worcester’s Dictionary the word was\r\napplied to a body of laws framed by the Salians or Salian Franks, about\r\nthe beginning of the fifth century, but who the Salians were, no one has\r\nyet been able to explain. The derivation from the River Saal, which\r\nHolinshed calls _Sala_, is wholly untenable, as well as the imputation\r\non the virtue of the German ladies of the district through which that\r\nriver runs. The Salic law never prevailed in any part of Germany, but\r\nwas peculiar to such Keltic nations as France and Spain. It continued to\r\nprevail in France until the abolition of the monarchy under Louis\r\nPhilippe in 1848, and was never a question so much as debated in the\r\nImperial monarchy under the first or the third Napoleons. In Spain it\r\nwas abrogated only by Ferdinand VII., within living memory, in favour of\r\nhis daughter, the infant Isabella, whose accession to the throne led to\r\na civil war, which cannot yet be said to have ended, as long as Don\r\nCarlos or his family exist and keep their pretensions alive. On this\r\nsubject Voltaire, in his “Philosophical Dictionary,” has some pithy\r\nremarks. According to Froissart he says, “The kingdom of France is of\r\nsuch great nobleness that it never can allow the succession to go to a\r\nfemale,” and adds, “but one must confess that this decision is very\r\nunpolite for England, for Naples, for Hungary, and for Russia, in which\r\nlatter country four reigning Empresses have sat upon the throne.”\r\n\r\nIn the French “Etymological Dictionary” of Messrs. Noel and Carpentier,\r\nare cited various surmises as to the origin of the word, among others\r\nthat _salique_ is a corruption of _gallique_, that it comes from\r\n_Salle_--the great hall of a palace, from an imaginary tribe of Germans\r\ncalled in Latin _salice_, from _si aliquis_, the first words of the\r\nLatin document in which the Salic law was promulgated; from _sal_, salt,\r\nand from _Salogart_, the name of one of Pharamond’s jurisconsults, or\r\ncounsellors. Who shall decide when so many doctors disagree? Yet as the\r\nlaw was a Keltic law, passed by a Gaelic speaking people some centuries\r\nbefore the formation of the actual French language, search ought to be\r\nmade for the derivation of the word in Keltic sources. We there find _So\r\nlagh_, the “excellent or befitting law.” This was a name very likely to\r\nhave been given to such an ordinance by barbarians, who thought that\r\nnone but men and warriors were fit to govern them, or lead their armies\r\nto the conflicts in which they were perpetually engaged. The name of\r\nPharamond himself was purely Keltic, and signified a Highlander or\r\nmountaineer, from _fear_, a man, and _monadh_ a mountain. The four\r\njurisconsults who are reported to have drawn up the ungallant law at the\r\nrequest of Pharamond are given by Voltaire as Visogast, Harogast,\r\nSalogast, and Vindogast. In these names the final syllable, gast,\r\nappears to have been a title given to learned men of the Keltic tribes\r\nof the period, from _gasda_, or _gasta_, expert, or skilful. Brachet’s\r\n“French Etymological Dictionary,” printed at the Clarendon Press,\r\nOxford, in 1882, and advertised to have been revised by the French\r\nAcademy, does not contain the word salique or salic, which looks as if\r\nM. Brachet was not satisfied that it is really of French origin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLORD BRABOURNE, after many years’ collecting, has brought together a\r\nunique series of papers relating to the early history of Australia.\r\nThese have just been purchased by the New South Wales Government.

W. LISLE BOWLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDURING the examination of one of these ancient burial-places by Sir\r\nRichard C. Hoare, a storm of thunder and lightning surprised the\r\nantiquaries. “Our only place of refuge,” says Sir Richard, “was the\r\nbarrow, which had been excavated to a considerable depth. The lightning\r\nflashed upon our spades and iron instruments, and the large flints\r\npoured down upon us from the summit of the barrow, so abundantly and so\r\nforcibly, that we were obliged to quit our hiding-place, and abide the\r\npelting of the pitiless storm upon the bleak and unsheltered down.” Mr.\r\nBowles, being of the party, sent the following beautiful poem the next\r\nmorning to Sir R. C. Hoare:--\r\n\r\n    “Let me, let me sleep again;\r\n     Thus methought, in feeble strain,\r\n     Plained from its disturbed bed\r\n     The spirit of the mighty dead.\r\n     O’er my mouldered ashes cold\r\n     Many a century slow hath rolled,\r\n     Many a race hath disappeared\r\n     Since my giant form I reared;\r\n     Since my flinted[29] arrow flew,\r\n     Since my battle-horn I blew;\r\n     Since my brazen dagger’s pride\r\n     Glittered on my warlike side,\r\n     Which, transported o’er the wave,\r\n     Kings of distant ocean gave;[30]\r\n     Ne’er hath glared the eye of day\r\n     My death-bed secrets to betray,\r\n     Since with muttered Celtic rhyme,\r\n     The white-haired Druid bard sublime,\r\n     ’Mid the stillness of the night,\r\n     Waked the sad and solemn rite,\r\n     The rite of death; and o’er my bones\r\n     Were piled the monumental stones.\r\n     Passing near the hallowed ground,\r\n     The Roman gazed upon the mound;\r\n     And murmured, with a secret sigh,\r\n     ‘There, in dust, the mighty lie.’\r\n     Ev’n while his heart with conquest glowed,\r\n     While the high-raised flinty road[31]\r\n     Echoed to the prancing hoof,\r\n     And golden eagles flamed aloof,\r\n     And flashing to the orient light\r\n     His bannered legions glittered bright,\r\n     The Victor of the world confessed\r\n     A dark awe shivering at his breast.\r\n     Shall, then, the Sons of distant days\r\n     Unpunished on my relics gaze?\r\n     Hark!

Some account of the spot and\r\nof its early history, so far as I have been able to trace it, may\r\ntherefore be acceptable. The place was at one time a trading town upon\r\nthe Gulf of Spezia, and is said to have been founded by the Etrurian\r\nTarchon.[33] (See Strabo, lib. v.; Cato, Origines xxv.)\r\n\r\nLuni--“La Superba,” as she was proudly called of old--was situated at\r\nthe head of a bay, or rather arm, of the Mediterranean, forming a\r\ncommodious and deep natural harbour, and backed by that spur of the\r\nApennines which forms the Carrara Mountains, so famous for their\r\nexquisite marble. But for the numerous fragments of ancient anchors,\r\nchains, masts of vessels, and other objects which are now and again\r\nbeing brought to light, and for the vast blocks of stone forming the\r\nancient quay of the town, some of which may still be seen _in situ_, it\r\nwould be difficult to realise that here was the identical port so\r\nadmiringly mentioned by Ennius and by Strabo, and so famous as having\r\nsent forth armed vessels three thousand years ago to assist the Greeks\r\nin the siege of Troy, and from which so many thousands of tons of the\r\nCarrara marbles were exported to Italy and other countries in more\r\nrecent times.\r\n\r\nIt is on record that Titus Manlius here embarked the army with which in\r\nB.C. 537 he started to quell the rebellion of the Sardi. From this port,\r\nalso, the Emperor Claudius sailed on his attempt to conquer Britain.\r\n\r\nLuni continued to rank as one of the most prosperous cities of Etruria,\r\ntill it was harassed and invaded by the indomitable Ligurians, who made\r\nthemselves masters of it. Wrested from them by the Romans, and subjected\r\nto the Republic, the power of Luni rapidly declined; and, as though to\r\nhasten her ruin, successive inundations of the River Magra choked up her\r\nharbour with their deposits, while the sea, as if in concert with its\r\ntributary, receded from her shore. In 1015 A.D. Luni was taken and\r\npartially destroyed by the Saracens, and in 1185 Frederick Barbarossa\r\nhanded her over to the authorities of the Christian Church, who made the\r\ntown an Episcopal See.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the early history of the neighbouring city of La\r\nSpezia will be found the names of various bishops of Luni; but the\r\nlatter see extended over a period of little more than a century, for we\r\nfind that in consequence of the malarious and deadly exhalations arising\r\nfrom the stagnant pools left by the Magra’s floods and the retirement of\r\nthe sea from the bay, Luni had to be completely abandoned about 1300\r\nA.D.\r\n\r\nThe site has been hitherto but little explored, but considerable\r\nquantities of pottery, articles in bronze, coins, mosaics, &c., are from\r\ntime to time turned up by the peasants when cultivating their little\r\nplots of land. These treasures have mostly found their way into the\r\nhands of private collectors, I believe, and until steps are taken to\r\norganise a thorough exploration of the spot, much that would be in the\r\nhighest degree interesting to the antiquary and the public will remain\r\nburied in oblivion. At present all that can be seen of ancient Luni may\r\nbe summed up briefly thus: (1) Portions of a temple dedicated to\r\nPlantilla, wife of the Emperor Caracalla. (2) The amphitheatre, much\r\ndespoiled and overgrown. (3) A circular building, 9 metres in height,\r\nand containing rows of niches. (4) A large building supposed to have\r\nbeen used as a granary or depôt for military stores. (5) Portions of an\r\naqueduct. (6) Some prostrate columns, friezes, and capitals. (7) The\r\nancient well, still furnishing the clearest and coolest water in the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nFor some of the information herein contained I am indebted to Signor S.\r\nCerini, whose access to various archives and manuscripts has supplied me\r\nwith data, and who is the author of a pamphlet on the subject published\r\ntwo years ago. For the rest I have had to glean the meagre information\r\ncontained in this paper as best I could; but my visit to the spot has\r\nincreased my desire to know more about it, and my hope is that a day may\r\nsoon come when the hidden archæological treasures of the buried Luni\r\nwill be unearthed for the instruction and admiration of the public. I\r\nmay add that the spot is most picturesque, and well worthy the attention\r\nof artist and antiquary alike. For myself, so long as I live here, I\r\nwill do my best not to let the subject drop.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFROM a paper contributed by the veteran scholar, Dr. Edkins, to a recent\r\nnumber of the _Chinese Recorder_, it appears that about B.C. 2200 the\r\nChinese possessed a knowledge of the art of writing, a year of 366 days\r\nwith an intercalary month, the astrolabe, the zodiac, the cycle of\r\nsixty, of twelve musical reeds forming a gamut, which also constituted\r\nthe basis of a denary metrology for measures of length, weight, and\r\ncapacity, divination, and a feudal system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _History of the Wrays of Glentworth_--1523-1852. 2 vols. By CHARLES\r\n     DALTON, F.R.G.S.\r\n\r\nTHE founder of the Wray family, _i.e._, the first member of it who\r\nbrought the name into honourable notice, and who received a “grant of\r\narms”--that necessary appendage to gentility--was Sir Christopher Wray,\r\nwho “raised himself from nothing” to become Lord Chief Justice of\r\nEngland. This was in the middle of the sixteenth century. Since that\r\ntime some of his descendants have received the “honour” of knighthood,\r\nsome have had the baronetcy conferred upon them, whilst others have\r\ndistinguished themselves either in the senate or the field, or in some\r\nother public capacity. Although the work before us is of a genealogical\r\ncharacter, Mr. Dalton has endeavoured to amalgamate in it “many\r\ndifferent subjects, woven together into history.” Scattered through\r\nthese pages are numberless anecdotes--more or less associated with the\r\nWrays or with the families allied to them by marriage. The first of\r\nthese volumes was published by Messrs. Chapman & Hall as far back as\r\n1880; the second volume, issued in 1881, was “privately printed.” The\r\nauthor’s reason for not making his second volume public he explains as\r\nfollows: “I find there are so few of the many descendants of the Wrays\r\nwho take any interest in their progenitors, that it would be labour lost\r\nto cast my work into the great public trough, where it could have no\r\nchance of competing with any three-volume novel, even though that same\r\nthree-volume novel had no better claims to the notice of the reader than\r\nthe skilfulness with which the author had managed to clothe impurity\r\nwith a seeming garb of innocence.” “The Wrays of Glentworth” is far\r\nremoved from the ordinary run of dry-as-dust genealogies, and will be\r\nfound to contain much interesting matter. It may be added that the\r\nsurplus stock has been bought over by Mr. H. W. Ball, of\r\nBarton-on-Humber, by whom they are now announced for sale.\r\n\r\n     _The Order of the Coif._ By A. PULLING, Serjeant-at-Law. W. Clowes\r\n     & Sons. 1884.\r\n\r\nUNDER the above quaint but appropriate title, Serjeant Pulling has\r\ncompiled a most interesting memoir of that grade in the legal profession\r\nof which he will probably prove to be one of the last survivors. The\r\n“coif” is, according to Bailey’s dictionary, “a sort of hood or cap for\r\nthe head,” and serjeants-at-law (_servientes ad legem_) were called\r\n“Serjeants of the Coif, from the coif of Lawn which they formerly wore\r\non their heads under their caps, but now (1763) upon the hinder part of\r\ntheir wigs.” The author remarks most justly, as an excuse for\r\nundertaking this work, that “in this country we have a history of\r\nneither the Bench or [nor] of the Bar,” and that “the order of the coif\r\nwas the first phase of both.” And it is known to all that till quite a\r\nrecent date it contained nearly every legal celebrity both of the Bench\r\nand the Bar. The work is largely based on Serjeant Wynne’s tract,\r\npublished in 1765, entitled, “Observasions touching the Antiquity and\r\nDignity of the Degree of Serjeant-at-Law;” and it is an expansion of an\r\narticle in the _Edinburgh Review_ for October, 1878, on the same\r\nsubject, in which much of the matter of the book now before us is\r\nforeshadowed. The introductory chapter and that which follows it are\r\ntogether a study in English constitutional history. The following\r\nchapters treat of very many subjects, which will be interesting alike\r\nin Westminster Hall and in the new Law Courts; and the seventh chapter,\r\ndevoted as it is to the ancient habits and observances of the Order,\r\ntheir robes, their rings, and “posies,” their solemn processions, their\r\nfeasts, masques, revels, &c., is a storehouse of antiquarian learning,\r\nand as such most highly to be commended. The last chapter treats of the\r\nlater history of the Order down to its recent abolition--one which is on\r\nmany accounts deeply to be regretted. It is always bad to abolish old\r\nlandmarks unless they have come to stand in the way of progress and\r\nimprovement; and this charge we never heard brought against “The Order\r\nof the Coif.” The illustrations, eight in all, are admirable, and light\r\nup a book which is never dark or dull.\r\n\r\n     _A History of the Town and Parish of Nantwich._ By JAMES HALL.\r\n     Printed for the Author. Nantwich, 1884.\r\n\r\nTHE County Palatine of Chester abounds in quaint and curious county\r\ntowns, but few of them have a more interesting history than Nantwich.\r\nSome account of the town is to be found in Ormerod and in Lysons, and\r\nsmaller notices of it have been published more recently in a local\r\njournal, in whose files these are now buried. Mr. J. Hall has therefore\r\nsupplied a decided want, and by his researches in the Record Office and\r\nin the family papers of Messrs. Wilbraham and Tollemache, he has added\r\nlargely to our knowledge of its earlier history. These results he has\r\nnow placed before the world in a handsome quarto volume, the\r\nsubscription list at the beginning of which is a proof that an author,\r\nunlike a prophet, may succeed in getting “honour even in his own\r\ncountry.” The work treats in successive chapters of the foundation of\r\nNantwich, the history of the barony of which it formed a part, its\r\nchurch, hospital, grammar-school, and other ancient buildings, its early\r\ncharters, and other privileges, its guilds, fairs, and bridges, its\r\nmention in the Subsidy Rolls, its visitations from battle, plague, and\r\nfire, and its share in the struggles of the Civil war. The latter part\r\nof the volume is devoted to an account of its commercial importance, its\r\nbanks, its manufactories and industries, and especially that of salt,\r\nwhile full value is given to the contents of its parish registers, its\r\ncharities, and the histories of the several families connected with the\r\ntown, the Cholmondeleys, Wilbrahams, Tollemaches, Kingsleys, &c. The\r\nvolume is illustrated by several views, well engraved on stone, and some\r\nwoodcuts, showing the details of its street architecture. We would draw\r\nparticular attention to the view of “Old Houses in High Street,” given\r\non p. 415.\r\n\r\n     _Old Registers of the Parish of St. John Baptist, Peterborough._ By\r\n     the Rev. W. D. SWEETING, M.A. Peterborough: G. C. Caster. 1884.\r\n\r\nTHIS little _brochure,_ of some sixty octavo pages, formed the subject\r\nof a lecture delivered by Mr. Sweeting before the members of the Church\r\nInstitute in March last, and has been published by request. Among the\r\nentries quoted are several of a quaint and curious character, and some\r\nwhich contain glimpses into the life and habits of our predecessors,\r\nthereby imparting to them an amount of interest which will probably be\r\nfound wanting in the registers of the present day when they come to be\r\nexamined some 300 years hence. The clergy are now supplied by authority\r\nwith books, with spaces marked out and ruled for dates and names, and\r\nthe insertion of anything beyond the mere fact registered seems to be in\r\nevery way discouraged.\r\n\r\n_Old Aunt Elspa’s A B C_, “imagined and adorned” by JOSEPH CRAWHALL\r\n(Field & Tuer), is a quaint book for children, printed on rough\r\nhand-made paper, and illustrated with curious woodcuts after the manner\r\nof the old chap-books. It is one of the “chepe and curious bookes”\r\n“imprynted atte ye signe of ye Leadenhalle Presse, in ye Old London\r\nStreete, in ye Health Exhibition, South Kensyngton, London towne, in ye\r\nyeare of Grace, 1884.”\r\n\r\n     _Ye Historical Sketch of ye Olde London Streete._ Edited by T. ST.\r\n     Edmund Hake. Waterlow & Sons. 1884.\r\n\r\nUNDER the above title Mr. Hake has set forth in a neatly-printed\r\n_brochure_, embellished with eleven illustrations--or “gravinges” as\r\nthey are here called--the principal features in the now well-known Old\r\nLondon Street in the International Health Exhibition at South\r\nKensington. As he tells us in his introductory remarks, it would be\r\ndifficult for a historian, a romance writer, or even a poet, to select a\r\nsubject calculated to awaken more interest than Old London. “In secluded\r\nnooks and corners where an echo of the footstep can often be heard, may\r\nbe found some monument or landmark--a temple, tombstone, or\r\ntavern--which speaks eloquently of the past. The ‘writing upon the wall’\r\nmay be worn out; the stone once smooth may be wrinkled like an old face;\r\nstill such are the ‘things of fame,’ to inspire the minds of men, and to\r\nlead to reflection and research.” The illustrations embrace full-page\r\netchings of the north and south sides of the “street,” and smaller\r\nengravings of Bishopsgate, the Rose Inn, the Three Squirrels, Isaac\r\nWalton’s house, the tower of All Hallows Steyning, &c.\r\n\r\n_English Etchings_ for July and August (D. Bogue, 3, St. Martin’s-place,\r\nW.C.) contain several admirable examples of this popular art, among them\r\nbeing “Westminster-bridge with the Houses of Parliament,” by Mr. Ned\r\nSwain; and “Middle row, Holborn,” by Mr. A. W. Bayes. The clearing away\r\nof the block of buildings represented in the latter plate, a few years\r\nago, made it possible to see fairly and well the Holborn front of Staple\r\nInn, one of the oldest existing specimens of our street architecture,\r\ndating from the time of James I. It is seen on the right-hand side of\r\nthe plate. Dr. Johnson lived in Staple Inn in 1739, and there wrote his\r\n“Idler,” “seated on a three-legged chair, so scantily were his chambers\r\nfurnished.” This publication, which has now reached its thirty-ninth\r\nmonthly part, continues to maintain the high character which it has\r\nhitherto enjoyed.\r\n\r\nTHE _Journal of the British Archæological Association_ (Vol. xl., Pt.\r\nii.), which is now before us, contains a large number of most\r\ninteresting papers, as will be seen by the mere announcement of the\r\nfollowing titles: “Dover Records in the British Museum,” “Historical\r\nSketch of the Castle of Devizes,” “The Development of the Fortifications\r\nof Dover Castle,” “The Crosses at Ilkley,” “The Castles of Sandown and\r\nSandgate,” “Samphire,” “Recently-discovered Fresco at Patcham Church,\r\nSussex,” “Roman Embanking and Sanitary Precautions,” “Remarks on Recent\r\nArchæological Relics of London,” “Some Relics of the Past recovered from\r\nLondon Sites,” &c. Many of these papers were read by their authors at\r\nthe Archæological Congress at Dover last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObituary Memoirs.\r\n\r\n     “Emori nolo; sed me esse mortuum nihil æstimo.”--_Epicharmus._\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. ALFRED BENJAMIN WYON, F.R.G.S., died in June, aged 46. Mr. Wyon was\r\nadmitted a student of the Royal Academy in 1855, and after studying in\r\nthe School of Painting for some years, turned his attention to metallic\r\nwork, and in 1865 he united with his brother, Mr. Joseph S. Wyon, in the\r\nappointment of chief engraver of Her Majesty’s seals, in the execution\r\nof medals, and the important seals of State. This appointment was held\r\njointly by the two brothers until the death of Mr. Joseph S. Wyon in\r\n1873, since which time it was held singly by the subject of this notice.\r\nSince 1873, Mr. Alfred Wyon was entrusted with the preparation of the\r\nGreat Seal of England which is at present in use, the seal of the\r\ncolonies of the Cape of Good Hope, Fiji, and other Crown dependencies.\r\nDuring the last few years Mr. Wyon had collected a vast amount of\r\ninformation respecting the history of the Great Seals of England, and of\r\nseals attached to charters and other municipal documents. Papers upon\r\nquestions arising in connection with these subjects Mr. Wyon from time\r\nto time read at the meetings of the Archæological Association.\r\n\r\nTHE REV. MARK PATTISON, B.D., Rector of Lincoln College, Oxford, died at\r\nHarrogate on July 30, at the age of 71. He was born at Hornby,\r\nYorkshire, was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, and became a Fellow of\r\nLincoln College. He was elected rector in 1861. He was the author,\r\n_inter alia_, of “Isaac Casaubon, 1559-1604: a Biography,” and a “Life\r\nof Milton.” He edited Pope’s “Essay on Man, with Notes,” Pope’s “Satires\r\nand Epistles, with Notes,” and Milton’s “Sonnets, with Notes.” Mr.\r\nPattison, who was a trustee of the Crewe Charities, married, in 1862,\r\nEmilia Frances, youngest daughter of the late Colonel Strong, of the\r\nMadras Army, a lady who is well known as the author of the “French\r\nRenaissance,” and generally as an art-critic.\r\n\r\nM. ALBERT DUMONT, the distinguished author on Greek archæology, has died\r\nat Paris. He was 43 years of age, was a member of the Institute, and a\r\nhigh official at the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\nJOHN GUSTAVUS DROYSEN, Professor of History at the University of Berlin,\r\ndied on July 19, in his 84th year. Among his best-known works are a\r\n“History of Alexander the Great,” which was published in 1837; a\r\n“History of Hellenism,” two volumes, 1836-43; “Lectures on the History\r\nof the War of Freedom,” two volumes, 1840; “History of Danish Politics\r\nfrom Acts and Documents,” conjointly with Samwer, 1850, and a “History\r\nof Prussian Politics,” vols. i.-x., 1855-70.\r\n\r\nSIR ERASMUS WILSON, LL.D., the somewhat distinguished Egyptologist, has\r\ndied, at the age of 75. In 1831 he was elected a member of the College\r\nof Surgeons, and he became president of that body in 1881. He was a\r\nvice-president of the Society of Biblical Archæology and President of\r\nthe Egypt Exploration Fund, the success of which has been largely due to\r\nhis munificence. He gave £500 towards Mr. Naville’s excavations at\r\nPithom, and £1,000 to Mr. Petrie’s work at Tanis, and the Society has in\r\nmany besides financial ways been deeply indebted to his unflagging\r\ninterest. Among his published works, his “Egypt of the Past,” and “Notes\r\non Egypt and Egyptian Obelisks,” hold a foremost place. It was at his\r\nexpense that the Egyptian obelisk, commonly known as “Cleopatra’s\r\nNeedle,” now on the Victoria Embankment, was brought to this country. It\r\nis said to have cost him more than £10,000.\r\n\r\nHERR MAURICE THAUSING, Professor of Art History at the Vienna\r\nUniversity, and author of a work on Albert Durer, has been drowned in\r\nthe Elbe, at Leitmeritz.\r\n\r\nMR. WILLIAM DOBSON, formerly of Preston, a well-known Lancashire\r\narchæologist and local _littérateur_, has died, at the age of 64. He was\r\nthe author of “Rambles by the Ribble,” “A History of the Parliamentary\r\nRepresentation of Preston,” “Preston in the Olden Time,” and other\r\nworks. He was for many years proprietor and editor of the _Preston\r\nChronicle_. The third series of “Rambles by the Ribble” was published in\r\n1883, and a continuation of the work was in hand at the time of Mr.\r\nDobson’s decease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeetings of Learned Societies.\r\n\r\nMETROPOLITAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL ARCHÆOLOGICAL INSTITUTE.--The forty-first annual meeting, or\r\ncongress, of the Royal Archæological Institute was opened on Tuesday,\r\nAugust 5, at Newcastle-on-Tyne, this being the second occasion on which\r\nthe Institute has held its annual gathering in that city. Newcastle was\r\nalmost rebuilt half a century ago by one of its sons, Richard Grainger,\r\nso that it now presents but few attractions to lovers of the past, with\r\nthe exception of sundry old wynds or “chares” on the steep sides of the\r\nTyne, which still remain, and two or three churches, and the old Norman\r\ncastle which once was “new,” and from that circumstance gave its name to\r\nthe ancient city of Munc-ceaster, or the ancient city of the Monks,\r\nwhich it superseded. The part of this castle which is still standing has\r\nbeen of late years put into good condition, thanks to the energies of\r\nsundry local antiquarians and archæologists, and is now fitted up as a\r\nmuseum. One of the rooms, too, served as the headquarters of the\r\ncongress. At twelve o’clock the members of the institute, headed by the\r\nDuke of Northumberland and Lord Percy, were received in the Town-hall by\r\nthe Mayor (Mr. F. Newton), the Sheriff (Mr. T. Nelson, F.S.A.), and the\r\nother members of the corporation. The Mayor’s address was brief and to\r\nthe purpose. After welcoming the Archæological Institute on behalf of\r\nthe town, and paying a well-timed tribute to the noble president of the\r\npresent meeting and his son, he recapitulated the history of Newcastle\r\nfrom the era when it was the Pons Ælii of Imperial Rome, through the\r\nSaxon and Danish days to the time of the Conquest, soon after which it\r\nbecame a Norman stronghold. He then traced its career through the\r\nScottish wars and in the days of the Great Rebellion, and said that in\r\nthe Scottish Rebellions of 1715 and 1745 it was the headquarters of\r\nmilitary operations in the north. Of late years it had devoted itself,\r\nas a town, to the arts of peace; and it is justly proud of the place\r\nwhich it holds in modern progress and commerce. But its devotion to\r\ncommerce did not lead its inhabitants to forget or to undervalue its\r\nconnection with the past. The Sheriff added a few words in the double\r\ncapacity of a Newcastle man and a member of the Society of Antiquaries.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Northumberland, as president of the meeting, delivered a\r\nshort address, in which he drew a picture of the history of the border\r\ncoasts of Northumberland at various dates, its connection with the\r\nrecords of early Christianity in the north of England, the frays and\r\nborder forays by which it was so marked in the days of the Plantagenets\r\nand Tudors, and even down to the Stuart era, and the strange way in\r\nwhich old local customs had survived within it down to a very recent\r\ndate. Among the objects of archæological interest to which the members\r\nof the Institute would have their attention drawn during their stay in\r\nNewcastle, his Grace observed, were the Roman wall, built by the Emperor\r\nHadrian, the Norman keep in Newcastle, and the holy edifices at\r\nLindisfarne, Tynemouth, and Jarrow--the last the birthplace of the first\r\nof English historians, the Venerable Bede. In the antiquities of the\r\nnorth of England could be traced the history of the country from the\r\nperiod of the ancient Britons down through the Roman occupation to the\r\ntime of the conflicts of Saxons, Danes, and Normans. For the elucidation\r\nof these subjects much credit was due to the Newcastle Society of\r\nAntiquaries, and also to Dr. Bruce, the historian of the Roman wall, and\r\nMr. John Clayton and gentlemen who have devoted their lives to the study\r\nof the archæology of the North.\r\n\r\nA vote of thanks to the Duke of Northumberland was moved by Lord\r\nAberdare, and seconded by the Bishop of Newcastle, who drew the\r\nattention of his hearers to the great benefits which the England of\r\nto-day owed to their Norman and their Saxon ancestors, reminding them\r\nthat the study of the past, if followed up in a kindly and appreciative\r\nspirit, must teach the present and the future generations many important\r\nlessons of gratitude. The Duke of Northumberland, in a few short\r\nsentences, acknowledged the compliment, and the meeting was at an end.\r\n\r\nThe company were subsequently received in the lecture-room of the\r\nLiterary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle by the members of the\r\nlocal Society of Antiquarians, whose president, the Earl of Ravensworth,\r\naddressed to them a brief speech, greeting their arrival, and promising\r\nthem a wide field of interesting research on either side of the Tyne.\r\nWhether they went along the Roman wall westwards, to Holy Island and\r\nLindisfarne northwards, or southwards to Durham, or eastward to\r\nTynemouth--in every direction they would see traces of late Rome during\r\nChristianity. He ended by saying that he admired the study of\r\narchæology, for it made an old man young again, and made a young man old\r\nby increasing his field of observation and experience. In the afternoon\r\nthe members of the two societies met together at the Black Gate of the\r\nCastle, from whence they proceeded, under the guidance of Mr. W. H.\r\nLongstaffe, to inspect the remains of the castle, the new cathedral (St.\r\nNicholas Church), the remains of the old city walls, the Trinity House,\r\nthe Old Exchange, in which the Company of Merchant Venturers had its\r\nhome; and, finally, the churches of All Saints’, St. John’s, and St.\r\nAndrew’s. The leading features of the castle were commented upon by Dr.\r\nBruce and Mr. Longstaffe, who placed its date at about 1172-7, and held\r\nthat it was absurd to ascribe it to the previous century or to a son of\r\nthe Conqueror. Dr. Bruce pointed out the king’s chamber, with its\r\ncurious Norman chimney-piece, the whole of the chamber being cut out of\r\nthe solid wall; the queen’s chamber, a corresponding apartment on the\r\nother side of the building; the donjon or dungeon keep in the basement,\r\nand the Norman chapel, with its rows of round-headed arches, with\r\ncurious and costly mouldings. At All Saints’ Church the visitors were\r\nshown the fine brass of Roger Thornton--one of the finest in the\r\nKingdom; and in the mayor’s room at the Old Exchange a series of mural\r\npaintings, representing scenes and sketches from old Newcastle.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the antiquarian and historical sections respectively of\r\nthis Congress were opened at the rooms of the Literary and Philosophical\r\nInstitute by Dr. Bruce, the historian of the Roman wall, and the Rev.\r\nCanon Creighton, who has just been appointed to a chair of history at\r\nCambridge. The lecture of the former gentleman treated mainly of the\r\nsubjects with which his pen is so familiar, and especially with the\r\nearly introduction of Christianity into Northern England, quite apart\r\nfrom the emissaries of Rome and St. Augustine; whilst Canon Creighton\r\ndrew an interesting picture of the history of Northumberland,\r\nCumberland, and the adjacent counties, as the border district between\r\nEngland and Scotland, and therefore in many ways the sufferer from the\r\nwars between those two countries, and from the frays which continued to\r\nbe carried on between their inhabitants long after the two countries had\r\nbeen united under one Crown.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, by invitation of the Duke of Northumberland, the members\r\npaid a visit to the Castle of Alnwick. Mr. G. Clark, the great authority\r\non castellated architecture, explained every portion of the outer works\r\nand of the extensive fabric in succession. He showed reasons for\r\nbelieving that even in Saxon times the high ground on which the Castle\r\nstands was the site of a “burgh” then, and that it was afterwards seized\r\nupon and strengthened by the Normans. Much of the lower portion of the\r\nwalls, as they still stand, is Norman, though portions of it, such as\r\nthe barbican and some of the towers which crown the walls, are the work\r\nof the De Vescis and the Percys. He showed the value of its strong\r\nposition, supported as it was by a host of smaller fortresses by which\r\nit was surrounded, and illustrated the way in which, even if a part were\r\ncaptured, the rest of the Castle could hold out and annoy its\r\nassailants. The interior of the Castle, which is modern, and fitted and\r\nfurnished in the Italian style, was much admired. The furniture,\r\nornamentation, and fine gallery of paintings were made the subject of\r\ncomment by Dr. Bruce, who acted as _cicerone_ over the interior, as Mr.\r\nClark had done over the exterior of the building. At three o’clock all\r\nthe visitors lunched in the banqueting-hall of the Castle.\r\n\r\nOn their way to Alnwick, the company visited Warkworth Castle, on the\r\nCoquet, a magnificent building, but still little more than a ruin. It is\r\nvery much like Alnwick, though the points of difference between them are\r\nvery great and numerous. Standing on a projecting headland and swept on\r\nthree sides by the Coquet, it occupies a very strong and indeed\r\nformidable position, and must have at one time dominated over the whole\r\nsurrounding country, whilst it guarded the mouth of the river against\r\nthe incursions of the Danish and Scandinavian pirates. Here, too, Mr.\r\nClark acted as interpreter, and he explained in succession every\r\nseparate feature of the castle, including its central keep and the\r\nadjoining chapel, of which only a few traces remain. At the conclusion\r\nof Mr. Clark’s lecture most of the party walked up the meadows along the\r\nbanks of the Coquet and crossed the river in boats to inspect the old\r\nhermitage cut in the side of the solid cliff, which forms the subject of\r\nmore than one poem, and lives in Goldsmith and in Percy’s Reliques. The\r\nhermitage consists of two rough-hewn chambers, one of which was used by\r\nthe anchorite as a chapel, and the other served him as a bedchamber.\r\nBetween them is a small window of the Gothic type, which it was thought\r\nwas used by him as a confessional, as he sat within. It was not\r\npossible for all the members of the congress to inspect this interesting\r\nspot, as the river had to be crossed, and the ferry boat was not\r\nconstructed to carry more than a dozen passengers.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon some of the party went to Alnwick Abbey, in the valley of\r\nthe Alne, about a mile off, where some interesting tombs have lately\r\nbeen discovered, and the plan of some monastic buildings laid bare;\r\nothers drove to Hulne Abbey to see the grounds and park; and the return\r\njourney to Newcastle was made by special train.\r\n\r\nIn the evening papers were read in the architectural and archæological\r\nsections as follows: Mr. J. Bain on “The Ancient Percys of Scotland;”\r\nthe Rev. J. Hirst on “The Ancient Mining Operations in Britain;” Dr.\r\nHodgkin, “A Translation of Hübner’s Eine Römische Annexion”; and Canon\r\nRaine, of Durham, read a paper on “The Ecclesiology and Architecture,\r\nSecular and Religious, of Northumberland,” in which he condemned the\r\nmischievous practice of what was termed “restoration.” The so-called\r\nrestoration of a church now too often meant the destruction of all that\r\ngave it its value as an ancient piece of architecture. This paper was\r\nfollowed by a discussion, in which Messrs. Longstaffe, Walford, and\r\nothers took part, and in which Sir Edmund Beckett’s rebuilding of the\r\nwest front of St. Albans Abbey was condemned in strong terms.\r\n\r\nThursday was devoted to a visit to Lindisfarne and Holy Island, a place\r\nassociated, as every reader of “Marmion” knows, with the history of St.\r\nCuthbert. Arriving at Lindisfarne, the party made their way to the ruins\r\nof the abbey, which stand in a meadow, not far from the water’s edge, a\r\ncliff rising between it and the sea and protecting it on the south. The\r\nDean of Chester (Dr. Howson), in obedience to a very general request,\r\ngave a short biographical account of St. Aidan and a sketch of his\r\napostolic labours in the propagation of the Gospel throughout the north.\r\nAfter the Norman Conquest, he said, Lindisfarne was again colonised by\r\nthe faithful, and a Benedictine abbey founded in it, which lasted till\r\nthe Reformation, when it was granted by the King to the Earl of Dunbar,\r\nand the work of its spoliation began; the lead being first stripped from\r\nits roof, it soon fell into decay, and is now roofless. As a ruin it is\r\ncarefully preserved from further decay and injury by its present owner,\r\nSir William Crossman. A tribute having been paid by the Rev. Mr. Lowe to\r\nthe character of St. Cuthbert, the details of the existing fabric were\r\nexplained _seriatim_ by Mr. J. T. Micklethwait. Mr. Hodgson, a local\r\nantiquary, also commented briefly on the views of the last speaker.\r\nAfter luncheon, the parish church was visited; this adjoins the west\r\nfront of the Abbey, and has some Norman and early English features,\r\nwhich were duly explained by the Vicar. The company afterwards walked to\r\nthe castle at the eastern extremity of the island, and from this they\r\nhad good views of Bamborough Castle and the range of the Cheviot Hills.\r\nShortly before sunset the visitors returned to Newcastle.\r\n\r\nOn Friday the party set out upon a visit to Bamborough Castle and the\r\nadjoining Church. The former rises from the sea on a bluff and bold\r\nheadland in a princely way, quite worthy of its ancient history, from\r\nthe days when it was erected by the first Saxon King of Northumbria in\r\nthe middle of the sixth century; and it is worthy of note that\r\nAnglo-Saxon chroniclers style it the royal mansion. Though not so\r\nmagnificent in its interior, and covering less ground, it is scarcely,\r\nif at all, inferior to Alnwick, while its weird situation by the sea\r\nimparts to it a character all its own. Some persons compare it to Dover,\r\nbut the comparison will scarcely hold good, except as to its keep. The\r\ncastle owes much of its celebrity and of its comparatively perfect\r\ncondition to Nathaniel Lord Crewe, the munificent benefactor of Oxford,\r\nwho purchased the fabric, and left it in the hands of trustees to be\r\ndevoted to charitable purposes, both local and general. It contains a\r\nfine library and gallery, schools for the middle classes, and appliances\r\nof all kinds for the relief of shipwrecked persons. The fabric of the\r\ncastle was explained at considerable length by Mr. G. T. Clark, F.S.A.,\r\neach successive portion being separately discussed, and the whole\r\nchronologically illustrated. After the keep had been examined attention\r\nwas drawn to the outer bailey and other outworks of the castle, which,\r\nthough of inferior masonry to the central portion, are curious in their\r\nstructure, and possibly even earlier in date. The members of the\r\ncongress afterwards visited the parish church of Bamborough, which is\r\ndedicated to St. Aidan, and made a pilgrimage to the grave of Grace\r\nDarling, whose heroism of nearly half a century ago in rescuing the\r\npassengers of the _Forfarshire_ steamer is still remembered. In the\r\nevening the various sections resumed the reading of papers promised\r\naccording to the programme. Mr. Charles J. Bates read the first half of\r\nan exhaustive paper on “The Peel Castles of Northumberland.” These were\r\nillustrated by photographs of the castles, their keeps, gateways,\r\nwindows, buttresses, ramparts, battlements, and in many cases their\r\nheraldic bearings also, being shown by the help of magic lantern slides.\r\nThe Rev. G. F. Brown also read an interesting paper on the fragments of\r\nsculptured stones which are to be seen at Monkwearmouth and Jarrow.\r\nThose members of the Congress who did not go to Bamborough Castle spent\r\nthe day in examining the contents of the museum at the castle, the\r\ntreasures of the Literary and Philosophical Society, the Free Public\r\nLibrary, &c.; but what attracted them most was the local museum, partly\r\npermanent and partly on loan, which had been set out for their benefit\r\nin the rooms above the Black Gate at the castle. Here the Mayors and\r\nCorporations of Morpeth, Newcastle, and Carlisle exhibited their\r\nregalia, and besides these there was displayed a collection of stone and\r\nbronze implements, lent by Canon Greenwell, a collection of\r\necclesiastical plate, mediæval lacework, illustrated missals, and other\r\nmanuscripts, prints, &c.\r\n\r\nSaturday was one of the most interesting days of the congress, it being\r\ndevoted by a greater part of the members to a pilgrimage to\r\nMonkwearmouth and Jarrow, places well known as the abodes of the\r\nVenerable Bede, the earliest of our English Church historians. Before\r\nstarting, however, the Institute held, as is its established custom, its\r\nannual meeting, over which Lord Percy presided in virtue of his office.\r\nThe balance-sheet and other accounts, which happily showed an excess of\r\nincome over expenditure, were read and passed, and so also was the\r\nannual report, which recorded the fact that during the past twelvemonth,\r\nthanks to a committee appointed for that purpose, the Institute had been\r\nregularly incorporated--that is, placed under the Incorporated Societies\r\nAct--whilst another committee had been engaged on reporting on its\r\nbooks, prints, papers, &c., with a view to their re-arrangement. The\r\nrest of the report was taken up with a record of the resignation of the\r\nmuch-respected secretary, Mr. Albert Hartshorne, and the appointment of\r\nMr. Hellier Gosselin in his place; and this was followed by a short\r\nobituary notice of some of the members of the Institute who have died\r\nsince the Lewes congress, including Mr. John Henry Parker, C.B., author\r\nof the “Glossary of Architecture,” and the best explorer and interpreter\r\nof Ancient Rome; the Rev. Henry Addington, the most learned of\r\nBedfordshire antiquaries; the Rev. James Fuller Russell; and the Hon.\r\nWilliam Owen Stanley, M.P. A few alterations in the rules of the\r\nInstitute were proposed by the Rev. Mr. Spurrell, but were negatived, it\r\nbeing felt by the meeting that such matters had better be left in the\r\nhands of the council. It was agreed that next year’s congress should be\r\nheld at Derby. At twelve o’clock a special train took the members of the\r\ncongress to Monkwearmouth, where the ancient parish church was the\r\nobject of a pilgrimage. The tower is by far the most interesting portion\r\nof the church, being not only undoubtedly Anglo-Saxon, but of very early\r\nSaxon date. It was built towards the end of the seventh century by\r\nBenedict Biscop, who employed French workmen on its details, and caused\r\nthem to insert windows of glass, a luxury till then unknown in churches.\r\nBede gives a long account of this church, and of the monastery adjoining\r\nit, which contained, it is said, 600 monks prior to its destruction by\r\nthe Danes. Like Jarrow, the monastery, on its revival and restoration,\r\nbecame a cell subordinate to St. Cuthbert’s great church at Durham. The\r\ndetails of the structure of Monkwearmouth Church were described at\r\nconsiderable length by the Rev. Mr. Boyle, who pointed out some very\r\ncurious dwarf figures on either side of the western doorway of the\r\ntower, which were repeated in the interior, and remarked on the quaint\r\nmanner in which the square stones of the early Saxon churches had been\r\nworked into the upper part of the tower walls, which he thought might be\r\nas late as the Norman Conquest or a little after, though their leading\r\nfeatures were distinctly Saxon. Mr. Johnson, a local architect under\r\nwhom the recent restoration of the church has been effected, added a few\r\nremarks on other portions of the sacred fabric. It was proposed by Mr.\r\nMicklethwait that the stones should be protected by a lean-to building\r\nof wood placed round the lower portion of the tower, and this proposal\r\nseemed to gain general acceptance. Mr. Micklethwait also pointed out\r\nthat, in all probability, adjoining the west front of the tower there\r\nwas once a baptistery, of which he showed some traces still remaining.\r\nFrom Monkwearmouth the members of the congress made their way by special\r\ntrain to Jarrow, a place which has even still richer memories of the\r\nVenerable Bede, for here that historian spent the greater part of his\r\nlife, in the monastery built by Benedict Biscop in A.D. 680--a few years\r\nafter Monkwearmouth. The small hill on which the church of Jarrow stands\r\nwas not surrounded then as it is now by tall smoky chimneys and by\r\nodoriferous chemical “works,” but was then, as we are told, green and\r\nlonely. It was, and is still, placed on a peninsula formed by a\r\ntributary of the Wear, and from the fact of Roman vessels and monuments\r\nbeing found here in plenty, it probably occupies the site of a Roman\r\nstation. On the death of Benedict, Bede left Monkwearmouth and settled\r\nat Jarrow, where he became a monk, and here he passed the rest of his\r\nlife in study and devotion. He wrote many other books, the “Life of St.\r\nCuthbert,” for instance, but his _opus magnum_ was that Ecclesiastical\r\nHistory which he undertook at the suggestion and request of Ceolwolph,\r\nKing of Northumbria, a monarch who also ended his days as a monk in the\r\nAbbey of Jarrow. Bede died here in May, A.D. 735, and was buried in the\r\nchurch that he loved so well. The inscription on his tomb is recorded by\r\nWilliam of Malmesbury. The church itself is very like that of\r\nMonkwearmouth in its general features, though its tower is central, and\r\nnot placed at the western extremity, as is the case there. The chancel\r\nhere is the oldest portion of the fabric, and the three tiny windows in\r\nthe south wall, one of them circular are curious from their extreme\r\nsimplicity and the depth of their “splay.” In the vestry here, as at\r\nMonkwearmouth, are very many incised slabs of early Saxon date, if not\r\nmore primitive still. Inside the communion rails, on the southern side,\r\nstands an old oaken chair with a tall straight back, of very rude\r\nmanufacture. This passes current in the neighbourhood as St. Bede’s\r\nChair; but the tradition was shown to be baseless by the reverend\r\nlecturer, Mr. Boyle. The remains of the abbey on the south side of the\r\nchurch were next inspected; these, being of Norman design, were clearly\r\nnot the buildings once tenanted by Bede, though they stand on the same\r\nsite. One Norman chimney-piece was very much admired. The members of the\r\ncongress then walked down to the river and took advantage of a steamer\r\nplaced at their disposal by the Tyne River Commissioners to make a\r\nvoyage down the river to Tynemouth, whence the party made their way to\r\nthe ruins of the priory, on a bluff headland within the castle. A large\r\nportion of the western towers, some of the central tower, and the whole\r\nof the east end of the chancel are still standing, magnificent specimens\r\nof the Early English style, just as it began to pass into the Decorated,\r\nbut all bare and roofless. The small “Lady-chapel” was repaired and\r\ndecorated some quarter of a century ago by the late Duke of\r\nNorthumberland. The time at their disposal was very short, so Mr.\r\nJohnson, who had undertaken to read a paper on the Priory within its\r\nwalls, was obliged to confine himself to a very few historical and\r\narchitectural remarks. Those of the party who eschewed the voyage down\r\nthe Tyne went by invitation to Ravensworth Castle, where they were\r\nentertained by Lord Ravensworth, who showed them his family portraits\r\nand other treasures, and conducted them round the outer walls and towers\r\nof the older castle, which has given way to the present modern\r\nstructure. In the evening there were meetings in the antiquarian and\r\nhistorical sections in the great room at the Castle, when a paper was\r\nread by Mr. Park Harrison, and another by Mr. H. S. Skipton, on\r\n“Streatlam Castle and its Heroes.” But the chief interest of the evening\r\nwas centred in a lecture by Dr. Bruce on “The Northumberland Small Pipes\r\nand Scottish Bagpipes,” accompanied by musical illustrations. He was\r\nassisted by a choir of young ladies and gentlemen, who sang parts of\r\n“Chevy Chase” and other local ballads, and by two Northumberland pipers\r\nand a Scottish piper, who in turn treated the audience to various\r\nspecimens of their national airs and marches.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday there were special musical services at the cathedral of St.\r\nNicholas, where two appropriate sermons were preached, that in the\r\nmorning by Canon Dixon, and that in the evening by the Rev. E. Venables,\r\npreceptor of Lincoln Cathedral. The visit of the archæologists to\r\nNewcastle was made the subject of a sermon also at High Mass at the\r\nRoman Catholic cathedral, by the Rev. Father Dunn, and the Rev. J. Hirst\r\ndiscoursed on “The Church and Archæology,” at St. Dominic’s Priory\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nMonday was devoted to an examination of the Roman Wall and the Roman\r\nstation of Cilurnum at Chollerford. Dr. Bruce, the venerable topographer\r\nand historiographer of the Roman Wall, acted as guide. The party\r\nproceeded on foot, about 120 strong, to Brunton House, in the grounds of\r\nwhich they inspected a turret of the wall which has been newly brought\r\nto light, and which doubtless was one of those which occurred at every\r\nmile along the line. Its peculiar construction was made the subject of\r\nsome remarks by Dr. Bruce, who also explained the course which the wall\r\ntook along the adjoining hillside down to the River Tyne. Following the\r\ncourse of the wall they came to the river, where they were gratified by\r\nthe sight of one of the finest pieces of Roman masonry now to be seen in\r\nEngland, the foundations and piers of the bridge thrown by Hadrian or\r\nAgricola across the river. The stones are large and square, carefully\r\nfastened together with lead and iron, and morticed in a manner which\r\nwould have done credit to the best builder of to-day. Dr. Bruce also\r\npointed out some round stones which he considered to have been set\r\nupright, with chains or wooden bars between them, as guards on either\r\nside of the passage. Traces of the bases of the other piers are to be\r\nseen in the bed of the river and on the opposite bank. After luncheon\r\nthe party continued to follow the course of the wall to the Limestone\r\nbank, where Dr. Bruce again explained the peculiarities of the masonry.\r\nFrom this they took in their way back Chesters, the seat of Mr. J.\r\nClayton, which stands on the site of the old Cilurnum, and minutely\r\ninspected the excavations, which are so well known to antiquaries, and\r\nwhich have been so often described. They were shown the ground-plan of\r\nan entire Roman camp, four-sided and square, with its four gates, each\r\nprotected with a double guard-house; even the doorways through which the\r\nRoman soldiers passed in and out could be discerned on a careful\r\ninspection. Not far off was the forum or market place; in it also every\r\npart could be traced, and so could the general’s residence adjoining the\r\ncamp outside, and of course on the south side of the wall. Even the\r\nbath-house and the bake-house, with the hypocaust and the ovens _in\r\nsitu_ could be made out. The party were here directed to Mr. Clayton’s\r\nmagnificent collection of Roman altars and other very ancient treasures\r\nwhich have been dug up under his orders at various times during the last\r\nhalf-century, and are arranged under the entrance portico of the house.\r\nAmong these are several votive offerings to the Emperors, to the Deæ\r\nMatres, &c., and very many touching memorial tablets, implements of war\r\nand of agriculture, urns, amphoræ, and bones of men and animals. A\r\nsimilar collection in one of the summer-houses in the garden was also\r\ninspected. Here were seen two beautifully carved life-size figures\r\nrepresenting respectively Cybele and Victory. A finely carved Corinthian\r\ncapital and several small works were also explained by Dr. Bruce. Among\r\nthe altars, Dr. Bruce drew particular attention to one which bore the\r\ninscription, “To the ancient gods.” To this altar Dr. Bruce referred in\r\nhis address in opening the Antiquarian Section, and this, with others of\r\na similar character, he believes is evidence that Christianity prevailed\r\nin the North of England during the Roman occupation. Several of the\r\nRomans, he believes, embraced the new religion, while others who refused\r\nto accept the new faith, raised altars to the “ancient,” or “old,” gods.\r\nReturning to Newcastle, the company in the evening divided themselves,\r\npart going to the room at the Castle, where the Rev. G. R. Hall\r\ndiscoursed on the “British Remains in Northumberland,” and Mr. R. Pullan\r\non “Some Recent Discoveries at Lanuvium;” whilst the rest repaired to\r\nthe rooms of the Literary and Philosophical Institute, where Mr. E.\r\nWalford took the chair in the Architectural section. Here Mr. C. J.\r\nBates read the second and concluding part of his paper on “The Peel\r\nCastles of Northumberland,” which he illustrated by photographs thrown\r\non a sheet by the help of a magic lantern. This was followed by an\r\naccount by Mr. W. St. John Hope of the recent excavations which he has\r\nmade at Alnwick Abbey, under the auspices of the Duke of Northumberland\r\nand Lord Percy, and by which he has succeeded in bringing to light the\r\nentire outline and ground-plan of a religious house, of which, with the\r\nexception of one single entrance gateway, every trace above ground had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe first halting-place in Tuesday’s excursion was Prudhoe Castle, where\r\nthe archæologists were met by Lord Percy and by Mr. G. Clark, by the\r\nlatter of whom the fabric was described in detail. Mr. Clark pointed out\r\n_seriatim_ the barbican and the entrance gate, of late Norman work, with\r\nthe chapel over the latter. This was carefully inspected by all the\r\nparty, though its access, being at the top of a steep staircase, was not\r\nof the easiest. Passing on, the party were shown the remains of the\r\nkeep, the line of ramparts, with staircases in the walls, the inner and\r\nouter baily, and the castle ditch or moat, once full of water, but now\r\nnearly dry. Mr. Clark also explained the points in which the strength of\r\nthe castle as a military fortress consisted, and spoke at considerable\r\nlength about the De Vescis, the Umfravilles, and former lords. Many of\r\nthe members present remarked on the obvious resemblance between the\r\nnorth front of Prudhoe Castle and the north terrace at Windsor Castle,\r\nwith the level fields lying at its foot and reaching to the Tyne, just\r\nas the Home Park at Windsor reaches to the Thames. Upon leaving Prudhoe\r\nthe party went on foot to the parish church of Ovingham, where the\r\nNorman architecture was examined. The other places which they visited\r\nwere the church of St. Peter and St. Andrew, at Bywell, and the still\r\nmore interesting church and peel tower at Corbridge, and, lastly, the\r\nborder fortress of Aydon, a most remarkable and picturesque building,\r\nnow used as a farmhouse. It was built at the close of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and is an excellent specimen of a building which, like so many\r\non the Scottish border, was at once a mansion and a fortified\r\nstronghold. The building is surrounded by an outer wall, pierced with\r\narrow-holes, and enclosing three courtyards. The wall is surrounded on\r\nthree sides by a shallow ditch, while on the fourth it is protected by a\r\ndeep ravine. The building in former days was entered by an external\r\nstaircase, which was covered from above. Over the chimneys in one of the\r\nrooms are the arms of the Carnabies, its former owners. From the walls\r\nof Aydon the party were able to obtain a fine view over the valley of\r\nHexham; and they left the place with expressions of great regret that\r\nboth Hexham Abbey and Dilston Castle had been obliged to be left out of\r\nthe society’s programme. Corbridge, an old town, once large and\r\nflourishing, but now reduced to much smaller dimensions, and having only\r\none church instead of four, was the last on the programme of the day.\r\nThe small square peel tower in the market-place, formerly used as a\r\ngaol; the market cross, erected on the site of an older one by the Duke\r\nof Northumberland in 1814; and the fine old stone bridge across the\r\nTyne, with its span of seven arches--the only bridge which resisted the\r\ngreat flood of 1771--were in turn inspected by the party, who then\r\nreturned to Newcastle. In the evening the general concluding meeting was\r\nheld in the Literary and Philosophical Institute.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday the proceedings were brought to a close by visits to\r\nBrancepeth Castle and Durham, two as magnificent specimens of mediæval\r\narchitecture as they had seen throughout the week. The former, the seat\r\nof Lord Boyne, is a fine example of a baronial castle of the Middle\r\nAges, fitted up internally in tolerable harmony with its ancient\r\ncharacter. It stands on a piece of flat land looking down upon a shallow\r\nbut picturesque ravine, well wooded and watered, and surrounded by a\r\npleasant and extensive deer park. It shares along with Raby the\r\ndistinction of having been the ancient home of the Nevilles, though it\r\noriginally belonged to a Saxon family named Bulmer, whose heiress\r\nmarried one of the companions of the Conqueror. The church, which stands\r\nin the park, was first visited, under the guidance of the Vicar of\r\nBrancepeth, the Rev. H. J. Swallow, who in describing the building drew\r\nspecial attention to the fine wooden monumental effigies of Ralph, first\r\nEarl of Westmoreland, and Margaret, his wife, which adorn the chancel.\r\nThe Early English tower, the remains of an elaborately carved roodloft\r\nor chancel screen, and a chantry chapel now used as a vestry, were duly\r\ninspected. In the vestry the party were shown some autograph signatures\r\nof Dr. Cosin, sometime vicar of this parish and afterwards Bishop of\r\nDurham, whose name is identified with ecclesiastical ritual and\r\npost-Reformation vestments. The church is dedicated to an Irish saint,\r\nSt. Brandon, which renders it highly probable that the commonly accepted\r\nderivation of the place from the path of the wild boar or “brawn,” who\r\nused to lay waste the country hereabouts, is apocryphal. At the\r\nconclusion of the Vicar’s brief address, Mr. Beresford-Hope made a short\r\nspeech recapitulating the services of Dr. Cosin to the English Church,\r\nhe being the chief supporter, after Laud, of the Anglo-Catholic\r\ntradition which has paved the way for the Oxford movement and for the\r\nwork of the Cambridge Camden Society. On arriving within the precincts\r\nof the castle, Mr. Swallow proceeded to explain the chief features of\r\nthe structure, which, he said, was built on the site of an earlier Saxon\r\nedifice by the Nevilles. It was from this castle that the Nevilles and\r\nthe rebel army set out to join the fatal rising of the north in the time\r\nof Mary Queen of Scots, which led to the deprivation of that great\r\nfamily of both Raby and Brancepeth. For some years after this date\r\nBrancepeth was vested with the Crown, but it was sold by Charles I., and\r\nafter passing through various hands was bought by the late Mr. Matthew\r\nRussell, one of the richest Commoners early in the present century,\r\nwhose granddaughter carried it in marriage to Lord Boyne, an Irish peer,\r\nwhose son a few years since was created Baron Brancepeth. The exterior\r\nof the castle was very expensively and substantially, though perhaps not\r\nvery tastefully “restored” about half a century ago, when many of its\r\nancient features were swept away and others obscured. The _enceinte_ of\r\nthe walls remains; but the entrance tower and the outer baily have been\r\nsadly altered, and even the baron’s hall, where there is to be seen a\r\nlarge stand of arms, has been renovated. So also has the chapel, though\r\nthe old walls still remain. The dining-room and drawing-room, with their\r\nsumptuous furniture and fittings, were admired; but all agreed that the\r\nchief attraction of the castle lay in its underground cellars and\r\ndungeons, which the company were allowed to inspect. Proceeding by\r\nspecial train to Durham, and having partaken of a hasty lunch, the\r\narchæologists met at the castle, now used as the headquarters of the\r\nUniversity of Durham. Here again Mr. Clark acted as their cicerone, and\r\nexplained all the features of the structure, its central keep, its great\r\nhall, its wide black staircase (the work of Bishop Cosin), its\r\ncommon-room, and its gateway. The pictures on the walls and the noble\r\ntapestry which lines its walls were examined. The castle was the abode\r\nof the Bishop of Durham till 1833, when Bishop Van Mildert gave it up to\r\nfound a university for the Northern counties. On the conclusion of the\r\ninspection of the castle, the Dean of Durham, Dr. Lake, gave, in the\r\nnave of the cathedral, a short _résumé_ of its history and a glance at\r\nits chief associations. This he did with great skill and taste, touching\r\non the successive eras through which the monastery had passed before it\r\nwas crowned by the present majestic structure--one which no less an\r\nauthority than Dr. Freeman had declared to be the finest church in\r\nChristendom, except the cathedral of Pisa, and scarcely inferior even to\r\nthat. He was followed by Mr. Micklethwait, F.R.S., who very briefly\r\ndescribed the architectural details of the fabric. The vergers\r\nafterwards guided the company round the site of St. Cuthbert’s shrine,\r\nthe Western Galilee, still rich in frescos and paint, the tomb of the\r\n“Venerable” Bede, the library, formerly the monks’ dormitory, with its\r\nnoble undercroft, and then led them through the crypt (the most ancient\r\npart of the entire edifice) into the cloisters. Here they were shown the\r\nnewly discovered prison or cell for refractory monks, which has been\r\nbrought to light during the last month. The party then, having inspected\r\nthe dining-room at the deanery, once the abbot’s chief parlour, passed\r\nout into the dean’s private garden, where tea and coffee and other\r\nrefreshments were served upon the lawn. The main party then returned by\r\ntrain to Newcastle, while the rest travelled southward to York, and the\r\nArchæological Congress of 1884 was at an end.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR PRESERVING THE MEMORIALS OF THE DEAD.--On July 30 a\r\nmeeting of the Council was held at the rooms of the Archæological\r\nInstitute, in Oxford-mansions, Oxford-street, Mr. Richardson, F.S.A., in\r\nthe chair, when the project of having the monumental inscriptions in the\r\nchurches of Norwich copied and printed _in extenso_ was considered.\r\nVarious reports were laid down before the council on the present\r\ncondition of monuments at Waltham Abbey, at Milford, Hants, at\r\nKensington, Paddington, Croydon, West Wittering, and North Mundham,\r\nSussex. It was stated that through the agency of friends of the society,\r\nsome fine brasses had been restored to the parish church of Cheam,\r\nSurrey, and a handsome incised stone slab had been saved at Fownhope,\r\nHerefordshire. It was also proposed to re-engrave the inscription over\r\nthe tomb of Captain John Smith, the eccentric voyager, which has always\r\nbeen an object of pilgrimage to Americans, in St. Sepulchre’s Church,\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nSHORTHAND.--_June 4_, Mr. T. A. Reed, President, in the chair. This\r\nmeeting was devoted to the exhibition of stenographic curiosities, of\r\nwhich a large number, chiefly literary, were exhibited. Manuscript and\r\nprinted Bibles, Psalms, &c., in the systems of Rich and Addy, were shown\r\nby Mr. C. Walford, Mr. Reed, Mr. Rundell, and Mr. Pocknell. A collection\r\nof the works of ancient authors of shorthand was sent by Mr. Barnett.\r\nMr. Walford exhibited the systems of Ramsay in Latin and French, and of\r\nNoah Bridges, and a MS. copy, made by Mr. Pocknell, of Timothy Bright’s\r\nbook in the Bodleian Library.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVINCIAL.\r\n\r\nESSEX ARCHÆOLOGICAL SOCIETY.--The annual meeting of this Society was\r\nheld at Halstead, on July 29. In the report, which was read, mention was\r\nmade of the elaborate catalogue of the museum at Colchester, which had\r\nbeen compiled by Mr. J. E. Price, F.S.A. The President (Mr. G. Alan\r\nLowndes), in moving the adoption of the report, spoke at some length on\r\nthe desirability of making a catalogue of the church plate of the\r\ncounty. On the conclusion of the ordinary business, the Rev. Cecil\r\nDeedes read a paper on “The Church Bells of Halstead and its\r\nNeighbourhood;” and the Secretary (Mr. W. H. King), on behalf of Mr.\r\nClarke, F.S.A., read a paper on “North Essex Bells,” giving the\r\ndimensions, inscriptions, and other particulars of a large number of\r\nbells in the northern part of the county. The paper stated that the\r\nSaffron Walden peal, cast in 1798, was considered the best in Essex.\r\nVisits were afterwards paid to the churches of Great and Little\r\nMaplestead; the old Norman castle at Castle Hedingham; Dynes Hall, the\r\nseat of Mr. C. B. Sperling; and Attwoods, the residence of Mr. Vaizey.\r\nAt the last-named place some old tapestry was inspected.\r\n\r\nESSEX FIELD CLUB.--There was a strong muster of this club on August 4\r\nfor a special visit to Colchester and Mersea Island. On the arrival of\r\nthe members at Colchester they were conducted over the castle by Mr.\r\nHorace Round, who explained the chief features of the building. After\r\nlunch the members drove to Mersea Island, and at West Mersea were\r\naddressed by Dr. Laver on the antiquities of the island, including the\r\nmysterious “red-earth mounds.” Dr. Laver insisted on the identity of St.\r\nPeter’s, Bradwell, with the site of the Roman “Othonæ,” an on the\r\nexistence of a ferry to it from West Mersea, where an unusually\r\nextensive tesselated pavement was discovered in the last century, and to\r\nwhich a Roman road led, across “the strood,” from Colchester. On the\r\nreturn journey, visits were paid to the ruins of Langenhoe Church,\r\nshattered by the earthquake, and to those of St. Botolph’s Priory. A\r\nconversazione at the Cups Hotel closed a most successful meeting.\r\n\r\nKENT ARCHÆOLOGICAL SOCIETY.--The annual congress of this association was\r\nheld at Sevenoaks, on July 30 and 31. The annual meeting was held at the\r\nSennoke Hotel, and, in the absence of Lord Amherst, the chair was taken\r\nby Sir Walter Stirling, Bart. From the twenty-seventh annual report,\r\nwhich was read, it appears that during the last twelve months, forty-six\r\nnew members have joined the Society. The fifteenth volume of the\r\n“Archæologia Cantiana” was sent out in February last. It is the seventh\r\nvolume, issued in ten years, 1874-84, during which the present Secretary\r\n(Canon Scott-Robertson) has been sole editor. These volumes (9 to 15)\r\ncontain 3,580 pages, or an average of 358 pages for each year’s\r\nsubscription of 10s. During the past twelve months, in response to\r\nrenewed applications, descriptions of nearly 200 additional sets of\r\nparish church plate have been obtained, making about 400 in all. The\r\nthanks of the Council are due to the Rev. J. A. Boodle and to Mr. J. F.\r\nWadmore, for much help in this matter. Engravings, from some of the\r\nElizabethan plate, have already been prepared by the Society’s engraver,\r\nand others are in progress. It was hoped that the book on “Kentish\r\nPlate” may be issued next year. The report was adopted, and Lord Sydney\r\nwas unanimously elected President, in the room of Lord Amherst,\r\nresigned. At the conclusion of the meeting, the members and friends\r\nproceeded to Sundridge Church, where Canon Scott-Robertson read a paper,\r\ndealing with the most interesting features of the building. A visit was\r\nafterwards paid to Squerryes Court, Westerham, and to Westerham Church,\r\nwhere a paper was read by Mr. Granville Leveson-Gower, F.S.A. The church\r\ndates from the thirteenth century, and contains several interesting\r\nmonuments and brasses. Chevening Park, the seat of Lord Stanhope, and\r\nChevening Church, were next inspected. The second day’s proceedings\r\nincluded visits to the old Archiepiscopal Manor House and Church of\r\nOtford--the chief architectural features of which were described by\r\nCanon Scott-Robertson and Mr. Loftus Brock--Eynesford Church,\r\nLullingstone Castle and Church, and Shoreham Church.\r\n\r\nSURREY ARCHÆOLOGICAL SOCIETY.--An excursion of this Society was recently\r\nmade to Leatherhead, Mickleham, Effingham, and Fetcham. The first\r\nmeeting was at Leatherhead Church, where a paper, written by Mr. R. H.\r\nCarpenter, was, in the absence of the author, read by Mr. Thomas\r\nMilbourn. Mr. Carpenter, in his paper, said there was evidence that the\r\nEnglish church had originally a central tower at the intersection of the\r\narms of the cross. In 1344 Queen Isabella obtained the living of\r\nLeatherhead for the convent of Leeds about the time when the tower\r\ncollapsed. The church had recently been restored, yet there was much to\r\nbe done. The plinth of the church could now be seen, and gave evidence\r\nof what the rest was before it was covered with plaster in 1766. The\r\ncompany then proceeded to Mickleham, where Mr. Ralph Nevill, F.S.A.,\r\nread a paper, in which he stated that in 1823 the church was restored by\r\nMr. Robinson, who showed unusual enlightenment as a restorer,\r\nconsidering the period. The church was erected in the reign of Edward I.\r\non the site of an old one. The font was very ancient. At Effingham, the\r\nnext place visited, Major Heales, F.S.A., read a paper on the church and\r\nits history. He said this was one of the few old churches of Surrey not\r\nmentioned in Domesday. The oldest document he could find mentioned the\r\noldest parts of the church as being of the twelfth century. Mr.\r\nGranville Leveson-Gower, F.S.A., next read a paper on the “Howards of\r\nEffingham,” after which the excursionists proceeded to Fetcham Church,\r\nthe architecture of which was described by Mr. Chas. Forster Hayward,\r\nF.S.A. Mr. Hayward said the church was of very early date; there were\r\nRoman bricks used in the walls, and the columns were good examples of\r\nNorman work. The original form of the church was, like that of most\r\nNorman churches, cruciform. Another paper was afterwards read by the\r\nRev. W. H. F. Edge, M.A., on the “Parochial Records.” The company was\r\nnext invited to inspect the mansion of Mr. Hankey, J.P., and here some\r\npaintings, particularly one in the centre of the drawing-room ceiling by\r\nSir James Thornhill, were much admired.--The annual general meeting of\r\nthe Society took place on July 23. Major Heales, F.S.A., presided, and\r\nthe report of the council and balance-sheet were adopted. The retiring\r\nmembers of the council were re-elected, as also were the auditors,\r\nMessrs. J. T. Lacey and W. F. Potter, and the hon. secretary, Mr. T.\r\nMilbourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAntiquarian News & Notes. A CHAMBERED mound, containing four skeletons,\r\nhas been lately unearthed near the Bridge of Waith, Kirkwall.\r\n\r\nTHE _Athenæum_ states that the Earl of Ducie is collecting materials for\r\na history of the Spanish Armada of 1588.\r\n\r\nLORD SYDNEY has been elected President of the Kent Archæological Society\r\nin the place of Lord Amherst, resigned.\r\n\r\nM. LEON LHERMITTE has completed an etching of Rouen Cathedral. A\r\nfinished proof is now to be seen at Messrs. Tooths’ gallery, in the\r\nHaymarket.\r\n\r\nTHE pictures by Hogarth lately bought from the Leigh Court collection\r\nfor the National Gallery have been hung over “The Marriage à la Mode.”\r\n\r\nAN outcry has been raised over the threatened destruction of the house\r\nin which Poe lived at Fordham during the most interesting period of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nACCORDING to the report of the British Museum just submitted to\r\nParliament, the number of visits to the reading-room and other\r\ndepartments for study or research in 1883 was 859,836.\r\n\r\nTHE annual meeting of the Somerset Archæological and Natural History\r\nSociety was held at Shepton Mallet, on August 26 and two following days.\r\nA report of the proceedings will be given in our next.\r\n\r\nMR. R. G. HALIBURTON, Q.C., of Canada, eldest son of the author of “Sam\r\nSlick,” intends to visit Borneo, Fiji, New Zealand, and Australia, to\r\ncomplete sundry ethnological inquiries.\r\n\r\nTHE annual meeting of the Library Association will be held on Sept. 30,\r\nand three following days, at Trinity College, Dublin. The chair will be\r\ntaken by Dr. J. H. Ingram, President.\r\n\r\nTHE International Conference of Librarians, which was to have been held\r\nat Toronto about the beginning of September, has been postponed, with a\r\nview to a gathering at New York or Boston in the autumn of 1885.\r\n\r\nTHE first edition of Braun and Hogenberg’s plan of London, from the\r\n“Civitates Orbis Terrarum” (1572), has been reproduced for the\r\nTopographical Society of London.\r\n\r\nMR. F. S. DRAKE, the historian of New England, has discovered the names\r\nof one hundred persons who took part in the destruction of the British\r\ntea in Boston Harbour. He has published the names in a volume called\r\n“Tea Leaves.”\r\n\r\nMR. ANDERSON, of Kirkwall, has in the press a new Guide to the Orkney\r\nIslands, in which special attention will be paid to antiquarian remains\r\nand traditional lore. Sir Henry Dryden has revised his notes for this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAMONG the treasures in the late Prince of Orange’s collections are\r\nnumerous paintings, miniatures, historical documents, and ancient relics\r\nof high value, in addition to the jewels of his mother, the late Queen\r\nSophia.\r\n\r\nIN January next will be commenced a new journal called “The Manx\r\nNote-book,” to be devoted to the history, antiquities, and legendary\r\nlore of the Isle of Man. The work, which has been undertaken by Mr. A.\r\nW. Moore, of Cronbourne, Isle of Man, will be published quarterly.\r\n\r\nMR. T. LOCKE WORTHINGTON has in preparation an historical account and\r\ndescription of the cathedral church of Manchester. The work will be\r\npublished by subscription through Mr. J. E. Cornish, of Manchester, and\r\nwill form a quarto volume, the impression being limited to 250 copies.\r\n\r\nTHE new volume of the “Encyclopædia Britannica” contains an article on\r\n“Palmyra,” by Professor Robertson Smith, in which the story of Zenobia\r\nis re-written by the light of the Aramæan and Greek inscriptions, and of\r\nthe coins that have recently come to light.\r\n\r\nTHE Committee of the Octagon Chapel, Bath, where Sir William Herschel\r\nwas organist from 1766 to 1782, invite subscriptions towards a memorial\r\nwindow of “the most distinguished citizen who ever lived in Bath.”\r\n\r\nFEGGEKLIT, on the Island of Mors, Denmark, the reputed birthplace of\r\nHamlet, is for sale by private treaty. On a hillside that forms part of\r\nthe estate will be found the grave of King Fegge, who was the identical\r\nperson slain by the young Prince to avenge the “most foul murder” of his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nFOR thirty-two years Captain Burton has been working more or less at his\r\ntranslation of the “Arabian Nights.” The book now nears completion.\r\nCaptain Burton will reproduce in English as closely as possible the\r\noriginal text, and for this reason in particular the work will be issued\r\nto subscribers only.\r\n\r\nMESSRS. BICKERS & SON have purchased the copyright of Lord Hervey’s\r\n“Memoirs of the Reign of George II.,” and are about to issue a new\r\nedition in three volumes, uniform with their new edition of “Wraxall’s\r\nMemoirs.” The original edition, published by Mr. Murray in 1848, has\r\nlong been very scarce.\r\n\r\nTHE valuable collection of ancient coins formed by the late James\r\nWhittall, of Smyrna, was sold by Messrs. Sotheby in July. The number of\r\nlots was 1,668, the sale lasted nine days, and the total amount realised\r\nwas £3,951 6s. Many of the coins are extremely rare, and some are\r\nbelieved to be unpublished.\r\n\r\nTHE current number of the Transactions of the Royal Historical Society\r\ncontains the first portion of a sketch of South African history from the\r\npen of the late Sir Bartle Frere, who read the paper now published at a\r\nmeeting of the Society in 1883. The first section deals chiefly with the\r\nfirst ten years of the Dutch settlement, which are chronicled in some\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nDR. A. HARKAVY, of the Imperial Library of St. Petersburg, has completed\r\nhis examination of the newly found Hebrew manuscripts of several books\r\nof the Old Testament, and at the request of the Imperial Russian Academy\r\nof Sciences he has communicated to that body the results of his labours\r\nin a report in German, entitled “Bericht an die Kaiserliche Akademie der\r\nWissenschaften zu St. Petersburg.”\r\n\r\nTHE Queen, it is said, is taking no little interest in a new book\r\ncompiled by Mr. Harold Boulton, Mr. Malcolm Lawson, and Miss Annie\r\nMacleod, which will bear the title of “Songs of the North.” The book\r\nwill be fully illustrated by the leading Scottish artists. A Gaelic\r\ntranslation is in hand, and the Queen has graciously given express\r\npermission that the book should be dedicated to herself.\r\n\r\nMR. F. DANBY PALMER has just published, in a thin quarto volume, “The\r\nHistory of the Tolhouse at Great Yarmouth,” of which some account,\r\ntogether with an illustration, has been given in these pages (see\r\n_ante_, pp. 1-5). The work has been written by Mr. Palmer in the hope of\r\nassisting the effort now being made to preserve an ancient building, for\r\nmany ages connected with the history of his native town, of events\r\nconnected with this municipal structure from the thirteenth century to\r\nthe present time.\r\n\r\nTHE August number of the _Century_ contains the first of a series of\r\nthree papers by Mr. W. J. Stillman, recording the experiences of a\r\nclassical expedition undertaken for that magazine. Mr. Stillman’s object\r\nwas to trace the wanderings of Ulysses, as described in the “Odyssey,”\r\nand to identify, as far as it is possible to-day, the localities visited\r\nby the Ithacan king. The articles will be illustrated by Mr. Fenn, from\r\nphotographs and sketches made by Mr. Stillman.\r\n\r\nTHE annual festivities in honour of St. James were on the point of\r\nterminating on Sunday, July 27, at Santiago, in Spain, when a telegram\r\nwas received from Rome by the Archbishop, announcing that the Sacred\r\nCongregation had declared the bones found about four years ago under the\r\nhigh altar of Santiago Cathedral to be truly those of the Apostle,\r\nSpain’s patron saint, ineffectually sought for hitherto since they were\r\nconcealed, from fear of Moorish raids, in the foundations of the\r\ncathedral in the year 1100, by Gilmirez, the first Archbishop.\r\n\r\nTHE complete renewal of the leaden envelope of the dome of St. Peter’s\r\nChurch, in Rome, has just been completed. It has occupied twelve years,\r\nand has cost over 200,000 lire (£8,000). The original covering was\r\napplied to the dome in an imperfect fashion, which made continuous\r\nrepairs a necessity. The total weight of the new cover is given at\r\n354,305 kilogrammes; and if it were spread out flat it would occupy an\r\narea of 6,152 square metres, or about an acre and a half. In stripping\r\noff the old plates, three of them were found to be of gilded copper.\r\n\r\nSOME interesting items of theatrical history are contained in the rings\r\nwhich Mr. Irving wears as Malvolio. One is engraved, “Formerly the\r\nsignet-ring of David Garrick. Henry Irving, from Edwin Booth, 1881.”\r\nAnother is the celebrated enamel ring, with head of Shakespeare, which\r\nGarrick used to wear, and which he bequeathed to his butler, and which\r\nwas afterwards presented to Mr. Irving by Lady Burdett-Coutts. And still\r\nanother signet is thus inscribed--“Tyrone Power, to his friend Harley,\r\n1830.”\r\n\r\nAN embellished copy of Baskett’s edition of the Bible, printed at his\r\npress at Oxford in 1817, and known as “The Vinegar Bible,” was included\r\namong the rarities sold last month at Messrs. Sotheby’s rooms. The\r\nvolume had inserted in it some 750 additional plates relating to\r\narchitecture, natural history, &c. In the same batch of books was a copy\r\nof Buck and Daniel’s Cambridge Bible, 1638, in which the curious\r\nmisprint in Acts vi. 3, “_Ye_ [for _we_] may appoint” was for the first\r\ntime printed.\r\n\r\nTHE following articles, more or less of an antiquarian character, appear\r\namong the contents of the magazines for August: _Edinburgh Review_, “The\r\nDivorce of Catherine of Aragon,” and “The Chiefs of Grant;” _Church\r\nQuarterly_, “The Church in Old London;” _Quarterly Review_, “Peter the\r\nGreat,” and “Greek Archæology;” _Art Journal_, “Castelfranco and its\r\nAltar-piece, by Giorgione,” “The Western Riviera, Nice,” and “The Isle\r\nof Walcheren;” _Cornhill_, “Some Literary Recollections;” _English\r\nIllustrated Magazine_, “Winchester,” and “Cutlery and Cutlers at\r\nSheffield;” _Temple Bar_, “Westminster School.”\r\n\r\nCATALOGUES of rare and curious books, all of which contain the names of\r\nworks of antiquarian interest, have reached us from Mr. C. Golding,\r\nColchester (chiefly topographical of the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies); Mr. H. Lowe, 89, New-street, Birmingham; Messrs. Reeves &\r\nTurner, 196, Strand; Mr. W. Withers, Leicester; Mr. W. P. Bennett, 3,\r\nBull-street, Birmingham; Messrs. Wyllie & Son, Union-street, Aberdeen;\r\nMr. J. Salkeld, 314, Clapham-road, S.W. (including a large number of\r\nbooks from the libraries of the late Sir G. Bowyer, Mr. Joseph Payne,\r\nand others); Messrs. Jarvis & Son, 28, King William-street, Strand,\r\nW.C.; Mr. Loescher, Turin.\r\n\r\nAT a recent meeting of the Society for Preserving the Memorials of the\r\nDead, a letter from a correspondent was read in which it was stated\r\nthat, whilst on an architectural tour, he found a register book open in\r\nthe church and the leaves blown on the floor, or at least, such of them\r\nas dampness and the mice had not obliterated. Although the living had\r\nbeen held by one family for nearly 300 years, and is a very rich one,\r\nthe writer adds: “I venture to affirm that a family could not prove its\r\ndescent for three generations from its parish register.” It is also\r\nstated that parchment registers, having one side vacant, were sometimes\r\ncut up for directions for game!\r\n\r\nA REPORT has been received from the committee appointed with reference\r\nto the preservation of the ancient records of the county of Middlesex.\r\nThe index of these valuable historical documents is very nearly\r\ncompleted, and they have all been properly classified and housed, so\r\nthat they will be preserved from any damage in the future. The documents\r\naltogether number 16,000 separate records. The money allotted for the\r\npurpose of classifying them not being found sufficient, it has been\r\ndecided, on the motion of Mr. Basil Woodd Smith, that a further sum of\r\n£200 be granted for the completion of the fittings of the new record\r\nroom and the sorting and calendaring of the records.\r\n\r\nMESSRS. CHRISTIE, MANSON & WOODS lately disposed of the collection of\r\nold Sèvres and Chelsea porcelain, old French decorative furniture,\r\nsnuff-boxes, and other decorative objects, the property of the late Mr.\r\nW.

Christie, Manson & Woods sold at their\r\nrooms the splendid collection of paintings by the old masters, the\r\nproperty of Sir Philip Miles, M.P., known as the Leigh Court Gallery.\r\nFive pictures were purchased for the National Gallery--the grand upright\r\nlandscape by Gaspar Poussin, “The Calling of Abraham,” “The Adoration of\r\nthe Magi,” by Bellini; the two Hogarths, portrait of Miss Fenton,\r\nafterwards Duchess of Bolton, as “Polly Peachum,” and “The Shrimp Girl;”\r\nand Stothard’s “Canterbury Pilgrims.” The total paid for these pictures\r\nwas under £4,000. The two Alfieri Claudes were purchased by Messrs.\r\nAgnew--the “Apollo Sacrifice” for 5,800 guineas, and the “Landing of\r\nÆneas” for 3,800 guineas--while the little picture of the “Herdsman at\r\nthe Ford” was bought by the same firm for 1,950 guineas, and the Murillo\r\n“Holy Family” for 3,000 guineas. The little predella panel by Raphael,\r\n“Christ bearing His Cross to Calvary,” was also purchased by Messrs.\r\nAgnew for 560 guineas, and has passed into the collection of Lord\r\nWindsor. Several important pictures were bought in. The sale realised\r\nnearly £44,300.\r\n\r\nAMONG the later additions to that most interesting corner in the Health\r\nExhibition where Old London is reproduced is a collection of views and\r\netchings of Old Southwark, shown by Mr. S. Drewet (F. S. Nichols & Co.)\r\nin the Guard Chamber over the Bishop’s Gate. Old London Bridge as it\r\nappeared in the time of Henry VIII. and at several periods since until\r\nits demolition may here be seen, as well as some of the historic\r\nbuildings of Southwark--Winchester Palace, &c., and its famous hostels,\r\nthe old Tabarde and the White Hart, of which the picturesque\r\ncharacteristics have been preserved in etchings by Mr. Percy Thomas.\r\nSome reproductions of old maps and a small collection of pottery,\r\nweapons, and coins found in the borough of Southwark, and most of them\r\nduring the progress of excavations on the site of the old Tabarde Inn,\r\nshould not be passed unnoticed. The rooms over the workshops on the\r\nnorth side of the Old London street at the Exhibition have been filled\r\nwith furniture of antique form, and the walls hung with tapestries from\r\nthe Royal Tapestry Works at Windsor. Along the south side a very fine\r\ncollection of armour, arms, and ancient and mediæval ironwork has been\r\narranged by Messrs. Stark & Gardner, among the contributors being Lady\r\nDorothy Nevill, Sir Coutts Lindsay, the Rev. Canon Harford, Mr. J. G.\r\nLitchfield, and Mr. J. E. Gardner, F.S.A.\r\n\r\nTHE sale of the first portion of the extensive library of the late Mr.\r\nJames Crossley, President of the Chetham Society, took place at the\r\nrooms of Messrs. Sotheby, Wilkinson & Hodge, on Monday, July 21, and six\r\nfollowing days. Many of the books were in an imperfect and stained\r\ncondition, which considerably affected the prices realised.

He has in\r\npreparation a book on his discoveries at Tiryns. The _Academy_\r\ncommunicates the following details with regard to these discoveries:\r\n“The walls of the prehistoric palace which Dr. Schliemann has\r\ndisinterred at Tiryns are formed of limestone and clay; the latter has\r\nbeen turned into brick by the action of fire, while the stone has been\r\nburnt into lime. In some places the surface of the walls had been coated\r\nwith stucco, on which traces of painting can still be observed. The\r\ncolours used in these paintings are black, red, blue, yellow, and white;\r\nand Professor Virchow has pointed out that the blue is composed of\r\npulverised glass mixed with copper, but without cobalt. One of the\r\npaintings represents the same pattern as that found on the roof of the\r\nthalamos attached to the Treasury of Minyas at Orchomenos. Another\r\ndepicts a man riding on an ox, whose tail he holds. The artist has made\r\nthree attempts to draw the tail, and has forgotten to obliterate the two\r\nunsuccessful ones. The paintings have been carefully removed and sent to\r\nAthens. Among the ruins of the palace twenty-seven bases of limestone\r\ncolumns have been discovered, but no drums, besides a sandstone capital\r\nin the old Doric style. The chambers of the building were full of\r\nobjects of all kinds, including pottery, obsidian knives, rude hammers\r\nof diorite, and grape-stones. No iron has been met with, and but little\r\nmetal of any sort, though lead is relatively plentiful. All traces of\r\nwriting are equally absent. The pottery resembles that of Mycenæ, but\r\nthe presence of obsidian and the scarcity of metal imply that Tiryns was\r\nthe older city of the two.”\r\n\r\nTHE name of John Payne Collier has been so long known to all those\r\npersons who take an interest in literature, that the recent sale of the\r\nfirst portion of the books and manuscripts which had belonged to the\r\neditor of “Shakespeare” by Messrs.

FRANCIS MALLETT.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Dr. Francis Mallett, Vicar of Rothwell, near Leeds, instituted 7\r\nJanuary, 1533, is styled in the church register, “Magister Franciscus\r\nMalett: Sacre Theologie Doctor.” He resigned this living before 1547. In\r\nthe catalogue of vicars, he is designated “Mr. Francis Malett, cap.”\r\n(capellanus or chaplain).\r\n\r\nIn a sketch of the life of Arthur Yeldard, one of the first Fellows of\r\nTrinity College, Oxford, founded by Sir Thomas Pope, it is stated that\r\nMr. Yeldard, while at Cambridge (in 1553) for his better support in\r\nstudy, received an annual exhibition from the Princess, afterwards\r\nQueen, Mary, by the hands of Dr. Francis Mallet, her chaplain and\r\nconfessor, the last master of Michael House in Cambridge, and dean of\r\nLincoln.\r\n\r\nAgain, I find that a Dr. Francis Mallett, as master of St. Katherine’s\r\nHospital,[34] offered to resign the mastership in 1559.\r\n\r\nOn December 18, 1573, a “Dr. Mallett” was buried at Normanton, and it is\r\nremarked in the parish register that there remained unpaid for his\r\nburial in the church, 3s. 4d.\r\n\r\nI wish to ascertain, if possible, whether the instances given refer to\r\none and the same man or no; and if so, whether he was a member of the\r\nancient family of the Mallets of Normanton, in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nJOHN BATTY.\r\n\r\n_East Ardsley, near Wakefield._\r\n\r\n\r\nARMS OF JOSUAH BARNES.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I send you a description of the armorial plate, dated 1700, of\r\nJosuah Barnes, who was appointed Regius Professor of Greek at Cambridge\r\nin 1695, and of whom Bentley said that he knew as much Greek as an\r\nAthenian cobbler.

HAMBLIN SMITH.\r\n\r\n_Woodbridge, Suffolk._\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTS AND CHESTERS.\r\n\r\n(See _ante_, pp. 47, 96.)\r\n\r\nSIR,--Mr. Round adds nothing of value to what has gone before.\r\n\r\n(1) As to the alleged “borrowing,” the word port must, on Mr. Round’s\r\nown showing, have been taken up, adopted, or _borrowed_ by the so-called\r\nEnglish pirates, before they incorporated it into their language; the\r\nquestion is, when?\r\n\r\nBosworth says that A.S. port means town in English, but that scholar has\r\nnow fallen into discredit, for others doubt or deny his accuracy;\r\nfurther, we find it used as a compound, thus: portreeve, portsoken,\r\nportman. Portreeve is, I affirm, by transition from the Latin _portus_.\r\nThe port of London extends from Yanlett Creek to Staines, so that the\r\n“city” itself is dwarfed by the larger jurisdiction appended to it; we\r\ncan readily explain the anomaly, but the usage appears to have extended\r\nto other places where the hythe or haven, _i.e._, boat-shelter, is not\r\nso clearly marked and then the word is thrust back upon us in a sense\r\nthat we repudiate.\r\n\r\nIt is further complicated with “gate” or “doorway”; portsoken, for,\r\ninstance, means a liberty outside the gate or port of Aldgate, and in\r\nmany northern towns where the Danes settled in force, we find the word\r\nport used for gate, as thus: Westport, Eastport, but it is not to be\r\nread as west or east-_town_; so the portman might mean a burgess told\r\noff to keep watch and ward over any particular gate of his own town;\r\njust as we have “wards,” _i.e._ guards, in London, originally confined\r\nto gates but extended to intermediate parts of the entire wall, for that\r\nwas the primitive arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe Viking invaders used boats that could be pushed up comparatively\r\nnarrow streams, and it might be contended that any inland place thus\r\nreached would be a _port_ of debarkation.\r\n\r\n(2) My word “ramify” expresses a real difficulty; I did try to spread\r\nout or extend Mr. Round’s argument under its different heads and\r\nbranches, _i.e._, to follow up the various _ramifications_ of his\r\nliterary matter, with a view to the extraction of a tangible meaning;\r\nand I still contend that his words _do_ imply that caer was put for\r\ncastrum; but it is certain that this “native form” was unknown on the\r\nsouth-eastern coast, for the transliteration shows that the Romans met\r\nwith dune or dinas, not caer or ker.\r\n\r\nA. HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nA BAKER BLESSED.\r\n\r\n(See _ante_, p. 44.)\r\n\r\nSIR,--Will Mr. Hussey take a suggestion for a half-answer to his query?\r\nIt may possibly put him on the track of the origin of the lines that he\r\nquotes:--\r\n\r\nIn “Hamlet,” Ophelia says: “The owl was a baker’s daughter.” The ideas\r\nfloating through her mind are connected with St. Valentine’s Day.\r\n\r\nGrimm gives a story that “the cuckoo was a baker’s (or miller’s) man,\r\nand that is why he wears a dingy meal-sprinkled coat. In a dear season\r\nhe robbed the poor of their flour, and when God was blessing the dough\r\nin the oven, he would take it out, and pull lumps out of it, crying\r\nevery time, ‘Guk-guk,’ look, look; therefore the Lord punished him by\r\nchanging him into a bird of prey, which incessantly repeats that cry.”\r\nThis story, Grimm says, is doubtless very ancient, and was once told\r\nvery differently. “That ‘dear season’ may have to do with the belief\r\nthat when the Cuckoo’s call continues to be heard after midsummer, it\r\nbetokens dearth.”\r\n\r\nAgain Grimm alludes to one of the many superstitions concerning the\r\ncuckoo in spring, and says that in some districts a rhyme runs thus:\r\n\r\n    “Kukuk _beckenknecht_\r\n     Sag mir recht,\r\n     Wie viel jar (jahr) ich leben soll.”\r\n\r\nHere the idea of the baker is brought in.\r\n\r\nGrimm gives a story of the woodpecker, which has also to do with the\r\nbaking element. A combination of the Scandinavian with the\r\nsaint-legendary element.\r\n\r\nIn Norway the red-hooded blackpecker is called Gertrude’s fowl, and the\r\norigin is thus explained. The story will be found in Mr. Stallybrass’\r\ntranslation of Grimm’s “Teutonic Mythology” (see vol. ii. p. 673),\r\ntogether with much curious information concerning rhymes and charms,\r\nwhich may possibly be of some help to Mr. Hussey in his researches for\r\norigins of curious old rhymes and verses.\r\n\r\nJ. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ARCHÆOLOGICAL DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\nSIR,--A find of some archæological interest was made a few days ago in\r\nthe churchyard of Hitcham, Bucks. In digging a grave on the south side\r\nof the (Norman) nave, a stone cist, or sarcophagus, was discovered 4 ft.\r\n6 in. from the present surface. Fourteen years ago a similar cist was\r\nfound; with the remains were a quantity of iron rings, 1¼ in. diameter,\r\nand iron nails, but no other indication of there having been a coffin.\r\nThe head of the present cist was then brought to view, but not\r\ndisturbed. The inside dimensions of the present cist were 6 ft. in\r\nlength, 12 in. wide at the head, and 8 in. at the foot; 19 in. at its\r\ngreatest width. The south side was composed of 5 slabs, the north side\r\nof 6; the covering slabs were 5 in number; also 1 at the head and\r\nfoot--18 stones in all, 13 in. deep at the head and 12 in. at the foot;\r\nthe side stones averaging 4 in. and the covering stones 5½ in. in\r\nthickness. The chalk or claunch stones of which the cist is composed\r\nwere rudely squared and hewn or axed on all sides with a tool 1 in.\r\nwide, and rounded on the edge; one other tool 3 in. in width, the axe\r\nmarks being sharp and clearly defined. A large and perfect skeleton was\r\nenclosed, but no trace of a coffin, wood or metal. The bed or floor of\r\nthe grave was composed of fine gravel-pit sand. The bones were\r\nconsiderably crystallised; probably the body was covered with carbonate\r\nof lime. The skull bore traces of having lain in a liquid; it was very\r\nfriable, and crumbled at the touch; the femur measured 18½ in. in\r\nlength. Llewellyn Jewitt says: “The mode of burial seems this: when the\r\nbody was placed in the stone cist, or sarcophagus, it was fully draped\r\nin its usual dress. It was laid flat upon its back, at full length, at\r\nthe bottom of the cist; any relics intended to be buried with it were\r\nplaced by its side. Liquid lime or gypsum was then poured in, upon, and\r\naround it, the face alone being left uncovered by the liquid. The body\r\nwas thus completely (with the exception of the face) encased in liquid\r\nlime, which, when it became set, formed a solid mass. When these are\r\nbrought to light and opened, a perfect impression or mould of the figure\r\nof the deceased appears on the bed of plaster or lime in which it had\r\nbeen enclosed, and, in some instances, the texture, and even the colours\r\nof the dress is clearly defined. Some years ago a cist was opened at\r\nYork, in which the body of a woman clothed in rich purple, with a small\r\nchild laid upon her lap, was clearly discernible in the plaster.”\r\n\r\nWhether this was an interment of the Roman-British or Anglo-Saxon period\r\nthe orientation was very decided in this case, as in the five others I\r\nhave seen in this spot, they all lying due east and west. Two-thirds in\r\nlength of this very interesting relic had to be removed to obtain the\r\ndepth required for the new grave. I collected the bones and placed them\r\nin the remaining third portion left undisturbed.\r\n\r\nJAMES RUTLAND,\r\n\r\nHon. Sec.

II.--SEAFORD, SUSSEX._\r\n\r\n\r\nON the Sussex coast, between Newhaven and Eastbourne, stands the\r\n“ancient town and port” of Seaford, a place which was formerly of some\r\nimportance--seeing that it could boast of returning two Members to\r\nParliament, and that it contained no less than seven churches; but,\r\nhaving been disfranchised under the Reform Act of 1832, it degenerated\r\ninto an obscure fishing village, from which condition, like many other\r\nplaces on the southern coast, having felt the impulse of fashion, it is\r\nnow rising to the dignity of a watering-place.\r\n\r\nIn very early times the site of the present town was doubtless chosen as\r\nadvantageous to the dwellers on the coast, and many traces of Roman\r\noccupation have been discovered hereabouts, particularly near the cliff\r\noverlooking the eastern part of the town, where is an extensive\r\nearthwork, locally known as the Roman Camp. About the year 1820\r\nevidences of a Roman cemetery were disclosed at Green-street, in this\r\nneighbourhood: these included sepulchral urns and coins, among the\r\nlatter being one of Antonia, daughter of Marc Antony.\r\n\r\nSomner has fixed upon Pevensey as the Anderida of the Romans; and a\r\ngreat battle between the Saxons and Britons in 485, at Mereredesburn, is\r\nthought to have been fought in this locality.\r\n\r\nSeaford suffered considerably from the ravages of the French in their\r\n“descents” on the English coast; and it was probably in the invasion in\r\n1545 that the place was burnt, and its several churches and other public\r\nbuildings destroyed.\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition that the privileges of the borough were first\r\ngranted by Edward I., in consequence of its inhabitants having supplied\r\nthe king with the gift or loan of “five ships and eighty mariners;” the\r\nsaid “privileges” comprised exemptions from toll and custom, namely,\r\n“lastage, tollage, passage, rivage, appensage, wreck,” &c., and with\r\nrights of “soc and sac and toll,” and freedom from “justices itinerant.”\r\nThe town received its charter of incorporation from Henry VIII. At that\r\ntime Hastings was in a pitiful state, as recited in the charter.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Charles I. the town was made a member of the Cinque\r\nPorts, which comprised Hastings, Sandwich, Dover, Romney, Hythe, Rye,\r\nWinchilsea, Seaford, Pevensey, Fordwich, Folkestone, Feversham, Lydd,\r\nand Tenterden; now, however, it is but a “member” of the first-named\r\nport, though with “separate local jurisdiction.”\r\n\r\nThe government of the town is a municipal corporation, consisting of a\r\nbailiff or mayor, jurats, and an indefinite number of freemen. The\r\nbailiff is also (_ex officio_) coroner for the liberty; and the jurats,\r\nwho are local magistrates and may be twelve in number, are chosen by the\r\nfreemen, who were formerly styled “barons.” These “barons” of the Cinque\r\nPorts possessed extensive and peculiar privileges under their charters,\r\nand attended the Brotherhood and Guestling of the Cinque Ports\r\nParliament, the last of which was held at New Romney, in July, 1828. The\r\nfirst bailiff, elected in 1541, was one John Ockenden.\r\n\r\nThe bailiff is annually elected on Michaelmas Day, with quaint\r\nformalities, which are thus set forth by Mr. M. A. Lower in his\r\n“Memorials of Seaford:” “At the summons of the church bell the assembly\r\nof freemen takes place in the town-hall, and after the _pro formâ_\r\nbusiness has been gone through, the _freemen_--leaving the jurats behind\r\nthem on the bench--retire in a body to a certain gatepost near West\r\nHouse, and there elect their chief officer for the year ensuing. The\r\nmotive for this singular proceeding seems to have been the prevention of\r\nunfair influence on the part of the magisterial body. The townsmen are\r\nattended on this occasion by the serjeant-at-mace in his proper costume,\r\nbearing the ensign of the bailiff’s authority in the shape of a small\r\nmace of silver, which is ornamented with the arms of Queen Elizabeth.\r\nThe procession commences at a place called the Old Tree, where it\r\nappears the town pillory anciently stood, as it is called in old\r\ndocuments ‘the Pillory Tree.’ The place of execution, or rather the\r\nperquisite of the ‘finisher of the law,’ is still pointed to by the name\r\nof a piece of land called ‘Hangman’s Acre.’” The Pillory Tree was\r\nstanding in 1578. The site is now marked by the “Old Tree” Inn.\r\n\r\nIn the 37th year of Elizabeth, the cucking-stool, the pillory, and the\r\nbutts are mentioned in a “presentment” by the jury as in a state of\r\ndecay. The pillory was an instrument of punishment to be met with in\r\nformer times in most old county towns; but the cucking or ducking-stool\r\nwas not so common, on account of its peculiar construction and use. It\r\ncould, of course, be used only in such places as had a convenient pond\r\nor piece of water at hand wherein to “duck” its unfortunate occupant.\r\nThe cucking-stool is referred to by some of the older poets. Thus Gay\r\nwrites:--\r\n\r\n    “I’ll hie me to the pond, where the high stool\r\n     On the long plank hangs o’er the muddy pool,\r\n     That stool, the dread of every scolding quean.”\r\n\r\nDown to the sixteenth century, Seaford had a harbour of its own. The\r\nriver Ouse flowed between the town and the shingly beach to find an\r\noutlet at Seaford Head, or Cliff End, and ships floated up to the\r\nhouses, in much the same fashion as they do at Shoreham even to this\r\nday; but by the accumulation of shingle through the action of the tides\r\nits outlet was diverted, and the harbour destroyed. A grant of Queen\r\nElizabeth, dated 1592, speaks of the “decayed haven of Seaforth, called\r\nBeame lands,” &c. This land, now used for the purposes of recreation,\r\nbut still retaining the corrupted name of the Bemblands, exhibits but\r\nfew traces of the river-bed which of old conferred upon the town the\r\ndistinction of a Cinque port. The haven in the end became a duck-pool.\r\n\r\nSeaford is a borough by prescription, and from the end of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, as stated above, returned two members to Parliament, and it was\r\nat one time represented by the celebrated statesmen, the elder Pitt and\r\nGeorge Canning; this borough was long remarkable for the obstinate\r\nelection contests between the partisans of the two noble houses of\r\nLennox and Pelham, and also for the open display of “bribery and\r\ncorruption,” which formed perhaps the chief political interest of its\r\nworthy burgesses.\r\n\r\nSeaford gives the title of “Baron” to the family of Ellis, Lords Howard\r\nde Walden; and it may be added that the custom of “Borough English”\r\nprevails here, whereby property descends to the youngest son.\r\n\r\nThe arms of Seaford are (like those of the other Cinque Ports) the\r\ndimidiated lions of England, with the three ships’ sterns. The town,\r\nhowever, has an ensign peculiar to itself: “Or, an Eagle displayed\r\nazure;” while the seal of Seaford, of which we give a representation,\r\nbears on the obverse an eagle, and on the reverse an antique ship.\r\n\r\nThe lordship of the manor of Seaford has belonged successively to\r\nfamilies of historic fame, notably the Warrens, the Poynings, the\r\nHowards, Dukes of Norfolk, the Monteagles (to whom it was granted as a\r\nreward for valour), and the Pelhams. One member, at least, of this\r\nlast-named family exhibited bravery in the defence of the town, if we\r\nmay judge from the following verses which appear on the monument of Sir\r\nN. Pelham at Lewes:--\r\n\r\n    “His valour’s proof his manly virtues prayse\r\n     Cannot be marshalled in this narrow roome,\r\n     His brave exploit in Great King Henry’s dayes\r\n     Among the worthye hath a worthier tomb;\r\n     What time the French sought to have sacked Sayfoord,\r\n     This Pelham did repell ’em back aboord.”\r\n\r\nThere are still to be met with in Seaford one or two old buildings which\r\nwould delight the antiquarian visitor. The Plough Inn possesses a fine\r\nold chimney-piece; and the “Crypt House,” and the Court House with its\r\njail beneath--somewhat similar to the Tolhouse at Great Yarmouth,\r\nalready described in these pages[35]--will not prove uninteresting.\r\nAmong the old records of the town is one referring to a curious trial\r\nwhich took place here in the reign of Elizabeth, in which the prisoner\r\nclaimed the “benefit of clergy.” The entry, which we quote from the\r\n“Memorials of Seaford,” runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n“Nich. Gabriell, a shepherd, was found guilty of stealing six shep,\r\n(sheep) at Chintinge. On being asked by the bailiff if he had anything\r\nto say why sentence of death should not be passed upon him, he claimed\r\n_the benefit of the clergy_, which was granted by the Court. Robert\r\nHyde, Vicar of Seaford, and another clergyman, handed him a book to make\r\nproof of his learning, whereupon he read it off like a clerk (_legebat\r\nut clericus_), and thus the heavier penalty was commuted for branding on\r\nthe hand.”\r\n\r\nThe parish church, dedicated to St. Leonard, exhibits marks of\r\nconsiderable antiquity, being mostly of the Decorated period; the tower\r\ndating back to the Norman era. It has been recently enlarged and\r\nrepaired, not in the best of taste; prior to that time the body of the\r\nfabric had been “a vile piece of patchwork, to which painted shutters\r\non the outside of all the lower windows gave a truly grotesque\r\nappearance.” The original chancel is supposed to have been burned down\r\nin the general conflagration of the town already mentioned. In the nave,\r\nopposite the south porch, is a curious piece of sculpture. A tablet in\r\nthe belfry records the recasting of the bells in 1807.\r\n\r\nThe bay of Seaford is one of the most dangerous parts along the coast,\r\nin consequence of its numerous shoals and rocks, and consequently the\r\nspot has become noted for its wrecks and “wreckers.” The latter are\r\nreferred to by Congreve in his epilogue to the “Mourning Bride:”--\r\n\r\n    “As Sussex men that dwell upon the shore\r\n     Look out when storms arise and billows roar;\r\n     Devoutly praying with uplifted hands\r\n     That some well-laden ship may strike the sands,\r\n     To whose rich cargo they may make pretence,\r\n     And fatten on the spoils of Providence;\r\n     So critics throng to see a new play split,\r\n     And thrive and prosper on the wrecks of wit.”\r\n                E. WALFORD, M.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Port” and “Port-Reeve.”\r\n\r\nBY J. H. ROUND, M.A.\r\n\r\n_PART IV._\r\n\r\n(_Completed from p. 24._)\r\n\r\n\r\nTURNING now to _ceaster_, I claim it, as I claim _port_, as a\r\ndistinctively English word. Just as, ever on the same principle, I see\r\nin the use of _weal_ (wall)--a word etymologically derived from\r\n_vallum_--for a _stone_ wall (_murus_), an indication that the Teutonic\r\nrovers, struck by a phenomenon to them so strange as a fortification\r\neven of earth, formed for themselves, out of _vallum_, a word denoting a\r\nbarrier _irrespective of its material_, so I contend that they formed\r\nfor themselves, from a phenomenon so strange as that _castrum_ which\r\nfaced them on the border of “the Saxon shore,” the word _ceaster_ by\r\nwhich to denote a walled enclosure, _irrespective of its size_. Is it\r\nnot a striking thought that, in these English rovers, we have the\r\nforefathers of those to whom, as they gazed on the Norman donjon,--\r\n\r\n     “Both the name and the thing were new.... Such strongholds, strange\r\n     to English eyes, bore no English name, but retained their French\r\n     designation of _castles_.”[36]\r\n\r\nThus, to return, as when they made the acquaintance of a stone wall\r\n(_murus_), they would apply their word _weal_ to it, so, when they\r\nreached the large Roman towns of the interior they would apply to them,\r\nas being walled enclosures, their own word “ceaster,” _totally\r\nindependent of the proper name by which they were known to Roman or\r\nBriton_.\r\n\r\nNow here we have an instance of the striking results that may follow\r\nfrom minute analysis of “these interesting philological fossils.” For it\r\nfollows, as a corollary from the above proposition, that the point of\r\nview from which all historians, whatever their school of thought may be,\r\nhave hitherto agreed to look at “-ceaster,” is entirely erroneous and\r\nmisleading. So far from being essentially a _Roman_, I shall prove it to\r\nbe essentially an _English_ termination. Thus, though in no way a\r\nfollower of Mr. Freeman’s sweeping theories, I go, it will be seen, in\r\nthis matter of fact, even beyond the exponent of the extreme “Teutonic”\r\nview.\r\n\r\nLet us ask ourselves, in the first place, what we mean when we talk of\r\ntowns with the _-ceaster_ termination having retained their “Roman\r\nnames.” Mr. Pearson, for instance, who is a follower of Mr. Coote,\r\nasserts that--\r\n\r\n     “Roman local names were preserved by the conquerors as they found\r\n     them.”[37]\r\n\r\nEven Mr. Allen, though an independent thinker, contends that--\r\n\r\n     “The English conquerors did not usually change the names of Roman\r\n     or Welsh towns, but simply mispronounced them about as much as we\r\n     habitually mispronounce Llangollen or Llandudno.”[38]\r\n\r\nAnd he goes, indeed, so far as to assert that--\r\n\r\n     “There are nowhere any traces of clan nomenclature in any of the\r\n     cities. _They all retain their Celtic or Roman names._”[39]\r\n\r\nTake, then, the case of Gloucester. Mr. Freeman and Prebendary Scarth\r\nundoubtedly represent, on these questions, the opposite extremes of\r\nthought. The former would minimise, and the latter would make the most\r\nof the survival of “Roman names,” yet on this point they are at one. “A\r\nfew great cities,” says Mr. Freeman,\r\n\r\n     “and a few great natural objects, London on the Thames and\r\n     _Gloucester_ on the Severn, still retain names older than the\r\n     English Conquest.”[40]\r\n\r\n\r\n“London and Lincoln,” says Prebendary Scarth,\r\n\r\n     “and _Gloster_ are noteworthy examples of places retaining, like\r\n     many others, the Latinised forms of still earlier names.”[41]\r\n\r\nAnd yet, as Mr. Allen most truly observes--\r\n\r\n     “To say that Glevum is now Gloucester is to tell only half the\r\n     truth; until we know that the two were linked together by the\r\n     gradual steps of Glevum castrum, Gleawan ceaster, Gleawe cester,\r\n     Gloucester, and Gloster, we have not really explained the words at\r\n     all.”[42]\r\n\r\nIt is the advantage of an unflinching analysis such as this that we are\r\nimmediately confronted in black and white with a form of which the\r\nexistence is necessarily involved, though hitherto surely overlooked.\r\nThat form is “Glevum castrum.” This then is the question that we have to\r\nask: _was “Glevum castrum” ever the name of Gloucester?_ “Glevum” we\r\nknow, and “Gleawan ceaster;” but if we cannot demonstrate the existence\r\nof a form “Glevum castrum,” the continuity of the chain is severed;\r\nthere is between them a missing link.\r\n\r\nNow for this form, although, as I have said, it is a necessary postulate\r\nto the accepted theory, there is absolutely, we may at once assert, no\r\nevidence whatever. Indeed, as in this same article Mr. Allen has himself\r\nobserved,--\r\n\r\n     “The new comers could not have learned to speak of a ceaster or\r\n     chester from Welshmen who called it a caer; nor could they have\r\n     adopted the names Leicester or Gloucester from Welshmen who knew\r\n     those towns only as Kair Legion or Kair Gloui.”[43]\r\n\r\nThus, then, as the Roman name was “Glevum,” and _not_ “Glevum castrum,”\r\nwe see that “Gloucester,” the English name, is _not_ the “Roman name”\r\npreserved--is not even, though Mr. Freeman would admit it, “older than\r\nthe English Conquest.”\r\n\r\nBut as yet we have only ascertained that “Gloucester” (that is to say,\r\n“Gleawan Ceaster”) was a new, an English, name. We have still to learn\r\nhow it was evolved, and what the name really meant in the mouths of “the\r\nEnglish conquerors.”\r\n\r\nTo solve this further problem, there are two points that must be borne\r\nin mind. The first of these points is that “ceaster,” though now only\r\nfound in place names, and therefore, naturally, to our ears, a\r\ncomponent of proper names, was, in the mouths of the earliest English,\r\nnot a proper but a common name. We are reminded, for instance, by Mr.\r\nGrant Allen, that in Beowulf the city-folk are described as the\r\n“dwellers in ceasters;” and even so late as the days of Alfred, Chester,\r\nas Mr. Freeman loves to remind us, is spoken of as “a waste ceaster,”\r\nthat is a deserted city. How, then, did this English word _ceaster_, a\r\nword formed to denote an object for which, being new to English eyes, a\r\nnew word had been added to their speech, pass out of use as a general\r\nterm, and become a component of certain proper names, embalmed in which\r\nit has descended even to our own day? Mr. Allen contends (though the\r\nsuggestion surely is irreconcilable with his previous hypothesis of\r\n_Glevum castrum_ having existed as a Latin form) that\r\n\r\n     “Sometimes they [_i.e._, the English] called the place by its\r\n     Romanised title alone, with the addition of _ceaster_; sometimes\r\n     they employed the servile British form; sometimes they even\r\n     invented an English alternative; but in no case can it be shown\r\n     that they at once disused the original, and introduced a totally\r\n     new one of their own manufacture,” &c.[44]\r\n\r\nNow this brings me to the second of the two points of which I spoke;\r\nthis is, that in the names we are considering, such as Gloucester and\r\nDoncaster, we have to deal with two component parts, and that the _nomen\r\nipsum_, the real English name, is always to be sought in the second\r\npart, and not, as has hitherto, it would seem, thoughtlessly been\r\nassumed, in the first. That is to say, that in _Gleawan ceaster_, as an\r\ninstance of the original form, we are to seek the true English name in\r\nthe _ceaster_, and not in the _Gleawan_. So far from seeing in this form\r\n“the Romanised title alone, with the addition of ceaster,” we ought to\r\nsee the English word _ceaster_ imposed by the conquerors upon the city\r\nof _Glevum_, a prefix to _ceaster_ being only added where necessary to\r\ndistinguish it from other _ceasters_. This is illustrated by the\r\nparallel case of the three Romanised forms, _Venta Icenorum_, _Venta\r\nBelgarum_, and _Venta Silurum_. In each of these three forms the true\r\nplace-name was _Venta_ (Gwent), and the tribal names are mere suffixes,\r\nadded for the sake of distinction. This parallel will also illustrate\r\nthe contrast between the Roman and the English Conquests. For whereas\r\nthe Romans were contented to Latinise “Gwent” as _Venta_, the English,\r\nsettlers rather than conquerors, acting as their descendants have done\r\nin America, not as they have done in Hindostan, ignored the Roman or,\r\nmore accurately, the Latinised British name, and, in their own tongue,\r\ncalled _Glevum_ “Ceaster.” Here I must again quote from Mr. Allen’s able\r\npaper, as clearly establishing this proposition, although the inferences\r\nwe draw from it are not the same:--\r\n\r\n     “Thus, in the north, Ceaster usually means York, the Roman capital\r\n     of the province; as when the ‘Chronicle’ tells us that ‘John\r\n     succeeded to the bishopric of Ceaster;’ that ‘Wilfrith was hallowed\r\n     as Bishop of Ceaster;’ or that Æthelberht the Archbishop died at\r\n     Ceaster.’ In the south it is employed to mean Winchester, the\r\n     capital of the West Saxon kings and overlords of all Britain; as\r\n     when the ‘Chronicle’ says that ‘King Edgar drove out the priests at\r\n     _Ceaster_ from the Old Minster and the New Minster, and set them\r\n     with monks.’ So, as late as the days of Charles II., ‘to go to\r\n     town’ meant, in Shropshire, to go to Shrewsbury, and in Norfolk, to\r\n     go to Norwich. In only one instance has this colloquial usage\r\n     survived down to our own days in a large town, and that is at\r\n     Chester, where the short form has quite ousted the full name of\r\n     Lega Ceaster. But in the case of small towns, or unimportant Roman\r\n     stations, which would seldom need to be mentioned outside their own\r\n     immediate neighbourhood, the simple form is quite common, as at\r\n     Caistor in Norfolk, Castor in Hants, and elsewhere.”[45]\r\n\r\nI must explain very carefully the difference between Mr. Allen’s point\r\nof view and my own. While I see the true English name in the English\r\nword “Ceaster,” and look upon its prefixes as merely added to\r\ndistinguish one “Ceaster” from another--just as in “East Bergholt”\r\n(Suffolk) and “West Bergholt” (Essex), or in the widely separated “East\r\nGrinstead” and “West Grinstead” of Sussex, we recognise the original\r\nname of each village as “Bergholt” and “Grinstead” respectively--Mr.\r\nAllen, by the absolutely converse process, would see the true English\r\nname in the full compound, such as “Glewanceaster,” whether formed by\r\nsimply Anglicising a Latin “_Glevum castrum_” (see p. 423), or, as he\r\nelsewhere holds (p. 434), by using the “Romanised title alone, with the\r\naddition of ‘Ceaster.’” He consequently sees, in the simple “Ceaster,”\r\nnot the original form, but a corruption, a “colloquial usage:”--\r\n\r\n     “As a rule, each particular Roman town retained its full name (?),\r\n     in a more or less clipped form, for official uses; but in the\r\n     ordinary colloquial language of the neighbourhood they all seem to\r\n     have been described as ‘Ceaster’ simply, just as we ourselves\r\n     habitually speak of ‘town,’ meaning the particular town near which\r\n     we live, or, in a more general sense, London.”[46]\r\n\r\nLet me take, as an illustration, a well-known passage, in which the\r\n“Chronicle” tells how the West Saxons, in 577, “took three ceasters,\r\nGleawan ceaster and Ciren ceaster, and Bathan ceaster.” Now, each of\r\nthese cities would be severally known as a “ceaster,” and, in due\r\ncourse, as _the_ “ceaster”--just as “forum” was developed by the Romans,\r\nand as “market” has been by ourselves (_vide ante_, v. 250)--but when,\r\nas here, mentioned together, they would have to be distinguished from\r\none another. The _hams_ and _tuns_ which covered the land were so\r\ndistinguished by prefixing to them the names of their English owners.\r\nThis could not be done with the _ceasters_, which did not become the\r\nhomesteads of English owners. The distinctive prefix was, therefore,\r\nsought in some existing (although, to the invaders), meaningless name,\r\neither that of the river on which it stood, as “Exan ceaster” (the\r\nChester on the Exe), or that of the place itself, “Glewan ceaster,” a\r\nform which may be paralleled in the “Fort Chipewyan,” “Fort Winebago,”\r\n&c., of their descendants in North America.[47] It is often, of course,\r\nmost difficult to say whether the prefix is derived directly from the\r\nriver, or indirectly, through the original place-name. But, in any case,\r\nwe must dismiss the hypothesis that the prefix was “the Romanised title”\r\nof the town, for the termination “an” (“Ex_an_,” “Gleaw_an_”) is found\r\nin cases where the Roman forms differed so widely as “Isc_a_” and\r\n“Glev_um_.” We must guard against the idea that such prefix was ever the\r\n“Roman name” itself, used in apposition to “ceaster.”\r\n\r\nTo resume, then, we have seen that there is no ground for supposing\r\n“_castrum_” to have ever formed part of the “Roman names” of those\r\ncities whose modern names end in “Chester,” &c. From this it has\r\nfollowed that the terminal in question is the result and badge of the\r\nEnglish invasion, representing the English word “ceaster,” the invaders’\r\nterm for a walled town, and not the equivalent of a mere _castrum_,\r\nthough etymologically derived from it in the first instance. We have\r\nalso seen that the terminal in question was not a mere “addition” to the\r\n“Roman name,” but was itself the new name imposed by the conquering\r\nEnglish, to which, when and where necessary, a prefix was in time\r\npermanently added, for the sake of distinction. It is not, surely, too\r\nmuch to say that if these conclusions were satisfactorily established,\r\nthey must gravely modify, if not revolutionise, the view which has\r\nhitherto universally prevailed, and which is based, I think, on a too\r\nhasty induction from the resemblance between the English and the Latin\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nI shall not here pursue further the vicissitudes and the fate of “port”\r\nand “chester,” but shall content myself with noticing the instructive\r\nfact, that, while these words have come down to us, similarly, in\r\ncompound forms alone, “chester” is a component in the names of _places_,\r\nand “port” in the names of _things_ (including, thereby, offices). Now,\r\nif “a walled town” was the meaning of _ceaster_, and “a trading town”\r\nthe meaning of _port_, why should we find this marked difference in the\r\nuse of words which, in sense, appear to have differed so slightly? Why\r\ndoes “chester” end words, and “port” begin them? Why is a town called a\r\n“chester,” when its governor is a “_port_-reeve,” and its court a\r\n“_port_-manmote?” The answer is to be found in this distinction: the\r\n_ceaster_ was the town _objectively_, that is, viewed as a natural\r\nobject, a walled enclosure; the _port_ was the town _subjectively_, that\r\nis, relatively to trade, “in its character of a mart or city of\r\nmerchants.”[48]\r\n\r\nThus it was that while _ceaster_ retained its sturdy objectivity, and\r\nwas merely qualified, as a place-name, by the addition of a distinctive\r\nprefix, _port_, on the other hand, referring as it did to the town\r\nviewed in a particular aspect, was only strong enough to become itself a\r\nprefix, used, for the purpose of distinction, in a quasi-adjectival\r\nsense. In _port-mote_ it served to distinguish the moot held in the\r\n“port” from the _scir-mote_ and _tun-mote_; in _port-reeve_ it served to\r\ndistinguish the reeve of the “port,” or trading town, from the\r\n_scir-reeve_, the _wic-reeve_, and reeves other innumerable.[49]\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSRS. BURNS & OATES have announced the intended publication of a\r\nseries of reprints of scarce ascetical books, many of which exist in the\r\npossession of private collectors, as heirlooms of old Catholic families,\r\nand in the libraries of religious houses.

We may here remark that Gahmureth\r\n     does not appear to have been constant in his attachments. After\r\n     having assisted Belakane, Queen of Zassamank, in the Moorish\r\n     regions, he married her, but deserted her before their son\r\n     Fierefiss was born. After that he married Herzeliede, whose son,\r\n     Parzival, was chosen to be King of the Grail. Gahmureth had also\r\n     been much in love with Anflisa, the French Queen, an episode, to\r\n     which Schionatulander here alludes; as does Herzeleide in her\r\n     conversation with Siguna, for she fears the French Queen has not\r\n     yet forgiven her successful rival, and may make her heart bleed\r\n     through the youthful lovers.\r\n\r\n     From the expedition in which Gahmureth was now engaged he never\r\n     returned, being treacherously killed by Ipomidon, one of the\r\n     Babylonian brothers. An account of his death, and of the\r\n     magnificent burial given to him by Baruch, is to be found in\r\n     “Parzival” (Book ii., Herzeleide).\r\n\r\n    “WHAT need to beat about the wood,\r\n      O fond, weak squire?\r\n    Thou, through thy skill at tilting, may\r\n      E’en the fair Duchess’ love acquire;\r\n    For love gives worthier reward\r\n      To those who arms with valour bear,\r\n    Than she to weaklings doth award.\r\n\r\n    Yet that thy heart aspires so high\r\n      Fills me with pride;\r\n    How has the tree its branches spread\r\n      Already out so far and wide.\r\n    Bloom finest flowers on meadow ground?\r\n      How has my cousin vanquished thee\r\n    With knowledge sweetest to be found.\r\n\r\n    Her mother, Schoisian, for joy\r\n      Was rightly named,\r\n    Since God’s creative power and skill\r\n      One of such loveliness had framed;\r\n    Her glance, clear, keen, as sunlight strong,\r\n      I hear all people soothly say\r\n    Doth also to her child belong.\r\n\r\n    And Kiot, who in fiercest fight\r\n      Aye glory won;\r\n    Before the death of his loved bride\r\n      Bowed down proud Catalonia’s son.\r\n    Daughter of both, Siguna sweet!\r\n      I greet thee, who must victor prove\r\n    Where maids for victory compete.\r\n\r\n    She o’er thee hath prevailed, and now\r\n      The task is thine\r\n    O’er her the victory to gain,\r\n      And to this end it shall be mine\r\n    To win her aunt for thee to speak;\r\n      So through Siguna’s glance once more\r\n    Shall bloom the colour in thy cheek.”\r\n\r\n    Schionatulander then with joy\r\n      Began his speech:\r\n    “So doth thy confidence in me\r\n      The burden of my sorrow reach,\r\n    For now with thy consent I may\r\n      Siguna love, who hath so long\r\n    Stolen my joy and peace away.”\r\n\r\n    Schionatulander’s hopes rose high\r\n      At the relief\r\n    That thus to him was measured out.\r\n      Yet let us not forget that grief\r\n    Fair Schoisian’s daughter too must bear\r\n      (Since she, too, is of joy bereft)\r\n    Ere happiness fall to her share.\r\n\r\n    For Catalonia’s princess now\r\n      Was pining sore,\r\n    Through the deep love within her heart,\r\n      Whose pain she long in silence bore;\r\n    The while the Queen, with fears oppressed,\r\n      Sad wondered what Siguna ailed,\r\n    And why the maid was so distressed.\r\n\r\n    Red as the heart of blooming rose\r\n      All steeped in dew,\r\n    So were the maiden’s tearful eyes,\r\n      Her face all of a blushing hue;\r\n    The bashful maid could not conceal\r\n      The love that for the youthful squire\r\n    She in her inmost heart did feel.\r\n\r\n    Then from true heart outspake the Queen,\r\n      With pitying love:\r\n    “It grieves me Schoisian’s child to see\r\n      In pain that once my heart did move,\r\n    When from the Angevin ’twas mine\r\n      To part; now wounds the thorn anew\r\n    To see the suffering that is thine.\r\n\r\n    Through country or through people, say,\r\n      Art thou distressed?\r\n    Or can the help of kith and kin,\r\n      Or mine bring comfort to thy breast?\r\n    Or will our efforts naught avail?\r\n      Say, whence hath gone thy sunny glance,\r\n    And wherefore is thy cheek so pale?\r\n\r\n    Now, orphaned child, upon my grief\r\n      Some pity take;\r\n    Though crowned with crowns of kingdoms three,\r\n      I count me poor for thy dear sake\r\n    Till I can make thy grief depart,\r\n      Until my searching eyes have found\r\n    The secret of thy sorrowing heart.”\r\n\r\n    “Then will I now my anxious fears\r\n      And cares confess;\r\n    ’Twere sin a silence now to keep\r\n      Against thy loving tenderness,\r\n    And ’gainst thy teaching to rebel.\r\n      Do thou my constant soother be,\r\n    Dear mother, then will all be well.\r\n\r\n    May God reward thee! never yet\r\n      Did mother kind\r\n    Show to her child a greater love\r\n      Than ’tis my lot with thee to find;\r\n    With joy my tears might overflow.\r\n      No more an orphan here am I,\r\n    Such tender love is thine to show.\r\n\r\n    Thy consolation, and advice,\r\n      And help I need,\r\n    One with another, since my heart\r\n      For my dear absent friend must bleed;\r\n    My torments all too painful prove,\r\n      My rambling thoughts upon one chord\r\n    Are knitted through out-going love.\r\n\r\n    For him, my friend, for whom my looks\r\n      For ever stray\r\n    From window to the street, or o’er\r\n      The heath when light dews pass away.\r\n    Too seldom do I see his face,\r\n      And therefore must my weeping eyes\r\n    Bear of my pining love a trace.\r\n\r\n    From window to the battlements\r\n      I sadly turn;\r\n    I look to east, I look to west,\r\n      Hoping some tidings I may learn\r\n    Of him to whom my heart is bound.\r\n      One scarce can count me young in love;\r\n    Amongst the older I am found.\r\n\r\n    If o’er the wild and heaving flood\r\n      ’Tis mine to glide,\r\n    My eyes are roving here and there\r\n      O’er thirty miles outspreading wide,\r\n    Hoping some tidings I may gain\r\n      Of that dear friend, who can alone\r\n    Release me from my load of pain.\r\n\r\n    Whither is all my joy now gone?\r\n      Wherefore should fade\r\n    The courage high that filled my heart?\r\n      Ah! sorrow doth one’s peace invade!\r\n    Yet willingly alone would I\r\n      The sorrow bear, but well I know\r\n      He longing would to me draw nigh.\r\n\r\n    Alas! too seldom doth he come,\r\n      Too long delays;\r\n    And now I shiver as with cold,\r\n      Now glow as with the fire’s fierce blaze.\r\n    Schionatulander warms my heart\r\n     As Salamander feels the glow.\r\n    That Agremontin doth impart.”\r\n\r\n    “Oh, woe! thy speech is far too wise,”\r\n      The Queen replied.\r\n    “Am I to thee betrayed? I fear\r\n      The Frenchwoman her power hath tried\r\n    O’er thee, through anger unto me;\r\n      Anflisa’s words are on thy lips,\r\n    For they are far too old for thee.\r\n\r\n    Schionatulander is a prince\r\n      From failings free!\r\n    But yet his kingdom or his rank\r\n      By him assumed will never be,\r\n    Since he, alas! thy love hath sought;\r\n      If the proud Queen Anflisa’s wrath\r\n    Hath not on me been fully wrought.\r\n\r\n    For he was given her when he left\r\n      His mother’s breast\r\n    Did malice not the counsel give\r\n      That brings to thee such sore unrest?\r\n    But joy may round ye both yet play;\r\n      And if he counts thee truly fair,\r\n    Let not thy beauty pass away.\r\n\r\n    Through love to him let once again\r\n      Thy beauty glow;\r\n    The colour in thy cheeks and eyes\r\n      Be such as youthful years should show:\r\n    If lightly thus thy looks can fade,\r\n      Thou hast had too short time for joy,\r\n    Too many cares are on thee laid.\r\n\r\n    Still if the youthful Dauphin hath\r\n      So marred thy joy,\r\n    He yet can give thee joy again;\r\n      For love and kindness by the boy\r\n    Have been inherited, I ween,\r\n      From mother fair and noble sire,\r\n    And kinswoman Schoiette the queen.\r\n\r\n    That thou so early cam’st to love,\r\n      Must I complain;\r\n    Thou wilt the grief Mahaute bore\r\n      For Gurzgri brave, live o’er again;\r\n    Her eyes confessed the secret wound,\r\n      Whilst victor he in far-off lands\r\n    Fresh trophies on his helmet bound.\r\n\r\n    To Schionatulander will praise\r\n      Ascend on high,\r\n    He comes of race to whom fair fame\r\n      Shall none e’er grudge or e’er deny,\r\n    But it shall far and wide increase;\r\n      Then let him chase thy grief away,\r\n    And bring instead blest joy and peace.\r\n\r\n    If at his glance sweet happy thoughts\r\n      Thy heart should yield,\r\n    I feel no wonder nor surprise.\r\n      How well he looks with shining shield,\r\n    Whilst round a firecloud seemed to glow,\r\n      Of sparks that fly from crested helms,\r\n    As his sharp sword deals out each blow.\r\n\r\n    Painter can’t paint him as he wields\r\n      The lance with grace:\r\n    There ne’er forgotten was before\r\n      So little in a manly face;\r\n    That thou should’st love him is to me\r\n      Not strange; in him thine eyes delight;\r\n    Thy love I grudge not unto thee.”\r\n\r\n    When thus was youthful love allowed\r\n      Between the twain,\r\n    Without a bar their love to cross\r\n      Their hearts might constant aye remain.\r\n    “Now cousin mine,” the maiden spake,\r\n      “For mine own love before the world\r\n    The heir of Graharz may I take.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohnson and Garrick.[50]\r\n\r\n_AN UNPUBLISHED JEU D’ESPRIT._\r\n\r\nBY SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.\r\n\r\n_PART I._\r\n\r\nJOHNSON AGAINST GARRICK.\r\n\r\nJOHNSON AND SIR J. REYNOLDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nREYNOLDS.--Let me alone, I’ll draw him out (_aside_). I have been\r\nthinking this morning, Dr. Johnson, on a matter which has puzzled me\r\nvery much; it is a subject that I daresay has often passed in your\r\nthoughts, and though _I_ cannot, I daresay _you_ have made up your mind\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nJOHNSON.--Tilly fally, what is all this preparation? what is all this\r\nweighty matter?\r\n\r\nR.--Why, it is a weighty matter; this subject I have been thinking upon,\r\nis Predestination, and Free will, two things, which I cannot reconcile\r\ntogether, for the life of me. In my opinion, Dr. Johnson, free will and\r\nfore knowledge cannot be reconciled.\r\n\r\nJ.--Sir, it is not of very great importance, what your opinion is upon\r\nsuch a question.\r\n\r\nR.--But I meant only, Dr. J., to know your opinion.\r\n\r\nJ.--No, sir, you meant no such thing; you meant only to show these\r\ngentlemen that you are not the man they took you to be, but that you\r\nthink of high matters sometimes, and that you may have the credit of\r\nhaving it said, that you held an argument with Sam Johnson, on\r\npredestination, and free will; a subject of that magnitude, to have\r\nengaged the attention of the world, to have perplexed the wisdom of man,\r\nfor these 2,000 years; a subject on which the fallen angels who _had not\r\nyet lost all their original brightness_ find themselves _in wandering\r\nmazes lost_. That such a subject could be discussed in the levity of\r\nconvivial conversation, is a degree of absurdity beyond what is easily\r\nconceivable.\r\n\r\nR.--It is so, as you say, to be sure; I talked once to our friend\r\nGarrick on this subject, but I remember we could make nothing of it.\r\n\r\nJ.--Oh noble pair!\r\n\r\nR.--Garrick was a clever fellow, Dr. J.; Garrick, take him altogether,\r\nwas certainly a very great man.\r\n\r\nJ.--Garrick, sir, may be a great man in your opinion, as far as I know,\r\nbut he was not so in mine; little things are great to little men.\r\n\r\nR.--I have heard you say, Dr. Johnson----\r\n\r\nJ.--Sir, you never heard me say, David Garrick was a great man. You may\r\nhave heard me say that Garrick was a good repeater of other men’s\r\nwords,--words put into his mouth by other men; this makes but a faint\r\napproach towards being a great man.\r\n\r\nR.--But take Garrick upon the whole; now in regard to conversation----\r\n\r\nJ.--Well, sir, in regard to conversation I never discovered in the\r\nconversation of D. Garrick any intellectual energy, any wide grasp of\r\nthought, any extensive comprehension of mind; or that he possessed any\r\nof those powers to which _great_ could, with any degree of propriety, be\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nR.--But still----\r\n\r\nJ.--Hold, sir, I have not done--there are to be sure, in the laxity of\r\ncolloquial speech, various kinds of greatness. A man may be a great\r\ntobacconist, a man may be a great painter, he may be likewise a great\r\nmimick: now you may be the one, and Garrick the other, and yet neither\r\nof you be great men.\r\n\r\nR.--But, Dr. Johnson----\r\n\r\nJ.--Hold, sir. I have often lamented how dangerous it is to investigate,\r\nand to discriminate character, to men who have no discriminative powers.\r\n\r\nR.--Garrick as a companion, I heard you say--no longer ago than last\r\nWednesday, at Mr. Thrale’s table----\r\n\r\nJ.--You tease me, sir. Whatever you may have heard me say, no longer ago\r\nthan last Wednesday, at Mr. Thrale’s table, I tell you, I do not say so\r\nnow; besides, as I said before, you may not have understood me, you may\r\nnot have heard me.\r\n\r\nR.--I am very sure, I heard you.\r\n\r\nJ.--Besides, sir, besides, besides--do not you know--are you so ignorant\r\nas not to know that it is the highest degree of rudeness to quote a man\r\nagainst himself?\r\n\r\nR.--But if you differ from yourself, and give one opinion to-day----\r\n\r\nJ.--Have done, sir, the company are tired, you see, as well as myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nT’OTHER SIDE.\r\n\r\nDR. JOHNSON AND MR. GIBBON.\r\n\r\nJOHNSON.--No, sir, Garrick’s fame was prodigious, not only in England\r\nbut over all Europe, even in Russia. I have been told he was a proverb;\r\nwhen anybody had repeated well he was called a second Garrick.\r\n\r\nGIBBON.--I think he had full as much reputation as he deserved.\r\n\r\nJ.--I do not pretend to know, sir, what your meaning may be by saying he\r\nhad as much reputation as he deserved; he deserved much, and he had\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nG.--Why, surely, Dr. Johnson, his merit was in small things only; he had\r\nnone of those qualities that make a real great man.\r\n\r\nJ.--Sir, I as little understand what your meaning may be when you speak\r\nof the qualities that make a great man: it is a vague term. Garrick was\r\nno common man: a man above the common size of men, may surely, without\r\nany great impropriety, be called a great man. In my opinion, he has very\r\nreasonably fulfilled the prophecy which he once reminded me of having\r\nmade to his mother, when she asked me how little David got on at school,\r\nthat I should say to her, that he would come to be hanged, or come to be\r\na great man. No, sir, it is undoubtedly true that the same qualities,\r\nunited with virtue, or with vice, make a hero or a rogue, a great\r\ngeneral or a highwayman. Now Garrick, we are sure, was never hanged, and\r\nin regard to his being a great man, you must take the whole man\r\ntogether. It must be considered in how many things Garrick excelled in\r\nwhich every man desires to excel, setting aside his excellence as an\r\nactor, in which he is acknowledged to be unrivalled; as a man, as a\r\npoet, as a convivial companion, you will find but few his equals, and\r\nnone his superior. As a man he was kind, friendly, benevolent, and\r\ngenerous.\r\n\r\nG.--Of Garrick’s generosity I never heard; I understood his character to\r\nbe totally the reverse, and that he was reckoned to have loved money.\r\n\r\nJ.--That he loved money nobody will dispute; who does not? But if you\r\nmean by loving money he was parsimonious to a fault, sir, you have been\r\nmisinformed. To Foote and such scoundrels, who circulated those reports,\r\nto such profligate spendthrifts, prudence is meanness, and economy is\r\navarice. That Garrick, in early youth, was brought up in strict habits\r\nof economy, I believe, and that they were necessary, I have heard from\r\nhimself; to suppose that Garrick might inadvertently act from this\r\nhabit, and be saving in small things, can be no wonder, but let it be\r\nremembered at the same time, that if he was frugal by habit, he was\r\nliberal from principle; that when he acted from reflection, he did what\r\nhis fortune enabled him to do, and what was expected from such a\r\nfortune. I remember no instance of David’s parsimony, but once, when he\r\nstopped Mrs. Woffington from replenishing the teapot; it was already, he\r\nsaid, as red as blood; and this is doubtful, and happened many years\r\nago. In the latter part of his life, I observed no blameable parsimony\r\nin David; his table was elegant, and even splendid; his house both in\r\ntown and country, his equipage, and I think all his habits of life were\r\nsuch as might be expected from a man who had acquired great riches. In\r\nregard to his generosity, which you seem to question, I shall only say\r\nthere is no man to whom I would apply with more confidence of success,\r\nfor the loan of £200 to assist a common friend, than to David, and this\r\ntoo with very little, if any, probability of its being repaid.\r\n\r\nG.--You were going to say something about him as a writer. You don’t\r\nrate him very high as a poet?\r\n\r\nJ.--Sir, a man maybe a respectable poet without being an Homer, as a man\r\nmay be a good player without being a Garrick. In the lighter kind of\r\npoetry, in the appendages of the drama, he was, if not the first, in the\r\nvery first class. He had a readiness, and a facility, a dexterity of\r\nmind that appeared extraordinary even to men of experience, and who are\r\nnot apt to wonder from ignorance. Writing prologues, epilogues, and\r\nepigrams, he said he considered as his trade, and he was what a man\r\nshould be, always, and at all times, ready at his trade. He required two\r\nhours for a prologue or an epilogue, and five minutes for an epigram.\r\nOnce at Burke’s table, the company proposed a subject, and Garrick\r\nfinished his epigram within the time: the same experiment was repeated\r\nin the garden, and with the same success.\r\n\r\n(_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: text decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe History of Gilds.\r\n\r\nBY CORNELIUS WALFORD, F.S.S., _Barrister-at-Law_.\r\n\r\n_PART IV._\r\n\r\n(_Continued from p._ 76.)\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.--_Gilds of Middlesex._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Gilds of this county were chiefly, but not entirely, centred in the\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n=London.=--In Chapter xiv. I have given an account of a Gild which existed\r\nin this City during the Anglo-Saxon period (A.D. 827-1013). It probably\r\nhad many predecessors during the Roman occupation, but of these no\r\nsufficient details have come down to us.\r\n\r\nI now propose to give some account of other Gilds in the City, naming\r\nthem generally in the order of their supposed establishment. I do not\r\nhere include the 89 gilds, which took the shape of City Companies for\r\nthe regulation of trades, &c., of which 12 were known as the Great\r\nCompanies, and 77 as the Minor Companies; while of these latter many\r\nhave altogether died out. Concerning such of these as now remain ample\r\ndetails are available: as to the great Companies, in Herbert’s\r\nwell-known History; and as to the others, in the newly-issued Report of\r\nthe Royal Commission into the Livery Companies of the City of London.\r\n\r\n_Gild of Parish Clerks._--Amongst the Minor Companies was the _Gild of\r\nSt. Nicholas_, founded in the reign of Henry III. (13th century), which\r\nafterwards rendered important services to the City, by preparing the\r\n“Bills of Mortality,” from which the appearance of the Plague became\r\nmanifest, and its progress in fatality recorded. These parish clerks\r\n(who were anciently poor _real_ clerks, _i.e._, clergy) formed a Gild,\r\nor fraternity, and so excelled in church music that ladies and men of\r\nquality on this account became members, and on certain days they had\r\npublic feasts, celebrated with singing and music. Upon working days they\r\nattended the schools. Their ancient duty at church was to assist the\r\npriest at the altar, sing with him, and read the Epistles.\r\n\r\n_Gild of the Glovers_, founded 1354.--This was a purely secular Gild.\r\nThe Ordinances now before us purport to be made by the masters and\r\nkeepers [or wardens] of the Craft of Glovers in the City of London, and\r\nthe bretheren. The following is a brief abstract only, for the\r\nOrdinances themselves are very full and extended:\r\n\r\n(1) Every brother shall pay sixteen pence a year, by quarterly payments,\r\ntowards providing two wax tapers to burn at the high altar of the Chapel\r\nof our Lady, in the new Church-haw beside London, and also to the poor\r\nof the fraternity who well and truly have paid their quarterage as long\r\nas they could.\r\n\r\n(2) If any brother be behind of payment of his quarterage by a month\r\nafter the end of any quarter he shall pay 16 pence, that is to say, 8d.\r\nto the old work of the Church of St. Paul of London, and the other 8d.\r\nto the box of the fraternitie. Also, as often as any brother be not\r\nobedient to the summons of the wardens, or be not present in the\r\n“heveyns that folk be dead,” and in offering at the funeral of a\r\nbrother, and in attendance at church with the fraternitie on the feasts\r\nof the Annunciation and Assumption, and others, he shall pay 16 pence in\r\nlike manner.\r\n\r\n(3) Every brother shall come to _Placebo_ and _Dirige_ in the “hevenys\r\nof dead folk” in suit or livery of the fraternitie of the year past, and\r\non the morrow to mass, and there offer, in his new livery or suit, upon\r\npain of 16 pence.\r\n\r\n(4) If a brother be behind in his quarterage for a year and a day, and\r\nthough it be in his power to pay it, he maliciously refuse, he shall be\r\nsummoned before the official of the Consistory Court of London. [See\r\nchapter xx.]\r\n\r\n(5) If any brother or sister be dead within the City, and have not of\r\nhis (or her) goods him (or her) to bury, he (or she) shall have burning\r\nabout his (or her) body five tapers and four torches, at the cost of the\r\nbretheren, provided the deceased have continued seven years in the\r\nfraternity, &c.\r\n\r\n(6) All the bretheren be clothed in one suit, &c.\r\n\r\n(7) The Masters, Wardens, and bretheren shall attend and hear mass on\r\nthe feast of the Assumption, &c.\r\n\r\n(8) Every brother shall keep his livery for four years, &c.\r\n\r\n(9) The fee for entrance into the fraternity; also the form of oath.\r\n\r\n(10) On the day of the feast, when the bretheren have eaten, they shall\r\ngo together to the Chapel of our Lady before mentioned, and there\r\ncontinue the time of _Placebo_ and _Dirige_, and on the morrow shall\r\nattend mass of _Requiem_, and from thence come together to their Hall,\r\non pain of 16d.\r\n\r\n(11) If any brother revile another, he shall be fined 6d. or 8d., &c.\r\n\r\n(12) All the bretheren, with their wives, shall go together to their\r\nmeat the Sunday next after Trinity Sunday, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n(13) Concerning the admission of apprentices.\r\n\r\n(14) Fines for “contrarying” against the rules.\r\n\r\n(15) Penalties for disobedience of rules and regulations as to\r\napprentices.\r\n\r\nThese rules had been signed by twenty-nine brethren, who at the same\r\ntime were sworn faithfully to keep and fulfil them.\r\n\r\n_Gild of the Holy Trinity_ (Aldersgate).--This is one of three Gilds\r\nwhich were founded in connection with St. Botolph without Aldersgate,\r\nconcerning which much information of interest will be found in Mr.\r\nAlderman Staples’ pleasant little book, “Notes on St. Botolph without\r\nAldersgate:” London, 1881. Regarding this particular Gild, the duty or\r\nobligation of its members was to pay devout honour to the “five wounds\r\nof Jesus Christ; the five joys of the Virgin Mary, and the Three Persons\r\nin the Glorious Trinity.” A charity founded by this Gild exists at the\r\npresent day, and is administered by the Lord Mayor and Recorder of the\r\nCity.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. Katherine_ (Aldersgate).--Oath to be taken on entry, and a\r\nkiss of love, charity, and peace. Weekly help in poverty, old age, or\r\nloss by fire and water. The members’ payments were quarterly, 3d., women\r\npaying at the same rate as men. Members to go to church on St.\r\nKatherine’s Day, and afterwards choose officers [no feast mentioned, or\r\napparently contemplated]. Burials were to be at the charge of the Gild,\r\nand to be attended by the bretheren. Any brother dying within ten miles\r\nof London was to have worshipful burial; all costs being made good by\r\nthe Gild. Loans were to be made to bretheren out of the Gild stock, on\r\npledge or security. Wax lights were to be found and used on certain\r\nfestivals; and further services after death. New members only to be\r\nadmitted by assent on the day of the assembly. Four men were to keep the\r\ngoods of the Gild and render an account. Assent of all the brotherhood\r\nrequired to any new Gild ordinances. Each of the brotherhood was to have\r\n“a vestement, a chalys, and a massebok,” at the price of x. marks.\r\n\r\n_Gild of Sts. Fabian and Sebastian_ (Aldersgate).--Same general features\r\nas the preceding; with the additional feature that the young were to be\r\nhelped to get work.\r\n\r\n_Gild of Garlekhith_, founded 1375.--This Gild was established for the\r\nworship of God, and to nourish good fellowship. All bretheren must be of\r\ngood repute. Each was to pay 6s. 8d. on entry. There were to be wardens\r\nwho should gather in the payments, and yield an account thereof yearly.\r\nA livery-suit was to be worn; and the bretheren and sisteren were to\r\nhold a feast yearly. Each member was to pay 2s. yearly. There were to be\r\nfour meetings touching the Gild’s welfare to be held in each year. There\r\nwere to be free gifts to the Gild by the bretheren of “what hym lyketh.”\r\nIll-behaved bretheren were to be put out of the Gild. On the death of\r\nany, all the others were to join in the burial service, and make\r\nofferings under penalty. In cases of dispute the matter was to be laid\r\nbefore the wardens. Any member disobeying their award should be put out\r\nof the Gild. Weekly help was to be afforded to all members of the Gild\r\nof seven years’ standing, in old age and in sickness; also, aid to those\r\nwrongfully imprisoned. New members were to make oath to keep the Gild\r\nordinances. Every brother chosen warden must serve, or pay 40s.\r\n\r\n_Gild of the Blacksmiths._--The Ordinances before us do not bear date\r\nuntil 1434. They are made by the Masters and Wardens of the whole\r\nCompany of the Craft “in the worship” of St. Loy. In all material\r\nrespects they resemble those of the Glovers.\r\n\r\n_Gild of the Shearmen_ [Clothworkers].--This is an ancient Company\r\narising out of interests connected with the woollen manufacture. The\r\nOrdinances before us bear date 1452, and recite that “the wardens and\r\nfreemen of the Craft for the more encrease and continuation of brotherly\r\nlove and good example unto the honour of God, our Lady St. Mary, and all\r\nSaints, by licence of the Mayor and Commonalty the City of London form a\r\nreligious brotherhood amongst themselves for the sustentation of a\r\nperpetual light of thirteen tapers to burn in the church of the\r\nAugustinian Friars in London before the image of our Lady.” This,\r\nhowever, seems to have been a fraternity inside the general Gild, the\r\nOrdinances of the latter being very minute in detail, but to the same\r\ngeneral purport as the Glovers.\r\n\r\n_The Gild of the Water-bearers._--This was formerly an important body in\r\nthe City of London (as its counterparts still are in some of the\r\nContinental cities of Europe, especially Lisbon); but it dates back\r\nprobably to a time anterior to that at which Peter Moris (the Dutchman)\r\nerected his water-works at Old London Bridge; and certainly before Sir\r\nHugh Myddleton brought his New River water into the City, which was in\r\n1620. The Ordinances before us purport to be made in 1496 by the Wardens\r\nof the whole fellowship of the brotherhood of St. Christopher of the\r\nWater-bearers founded within the Augustine Friars. There is nothing in\r\nthem requiring special comment.\r\n\r\n=German Gilds in London.=--But the most extraordinary feature was the\r\nexistence in London, at a very early period, of three Gilds of _Germans\r\nresiding and trading in London_. Speaking generally, their objects were\r\ngood fellowship, and where need might arise, the succour of the poor\r\nmembers of the Gilds. These were:--\r\n\r\n(1) _The Brotherhood of the Holy Blood of Wilsnak in Saxony._ The date\r\nof the formation of this Gild is not known, but its Ordinances were\r\nenrolled in the Commissary Court of London, April 1, 1459:\r\n\r\nIn the name of God that is Almyghti and of our Lady Seynt Mary his\r\nmoder, and for the blessid blode of his sone Jesus Christ which is by\r\nall Cristen people wurshipped at Wilsnak, and opynly called the Holy\r\nBlode of Wylsnak, and of all the Seyntes of Hevyne, the xiiijth day of\r\nAprill the yere of our Lord God Ml.cccc.lix. and the yere of King Henry\r\nthe Sixt. xxxvij. A fraternitie in the special honour of the seid Holy\r\nBlode of Wylsnak and of all the Holy Seynts of Hevyn is ordayned founded\r\nand devised in the Chirche of the Crossid Freres [Crutched Friars] of\r\nLondon for to norish encrece and engender love and peas amonge gode\r\nChristen people in the fourme sewyng, that is to weten.\r\n\r\nThen is set forth that the entrance fee was to be xx_d_., with other\r\nOrdinances after the manner of English Gilds of the period, and the\r\nfollowing concerning the benefits receivable:--\r\n\r\nAlso, if any brother or suster of the same Bretherhede by fortune shall\r\n[fall] yn naturall sikenesse by visitacion of God so that he nor she\r\nmought labore and travel to helpe them selfe, the same foke by warnyng\r\nto the maysters for the tyme beyng the same day of the sekenesse comyng,\r\nor on the morow at forthest, shall have xx_d_. every wike sewing\r\n[ensuing] unto the same seke be recovered of the sekenesse and that\r\ntrewly be payed at every wikes withoute any longer delay.\r\n\r\n(2) _The Brotherhood of the Holy Blood of Wilsnak in Saxony_, held in\r\nAustin Friars. Date of foundation not recorded; Ordinance enrolled in\r\nCommissary Court of London, Dec. 8, 1490. It is recited in the\r\nOrdinances that the Fraternity with “oon aasent and comen accorde for\r\nthe helthe and salvacion of our synfull sowles and for pease loue and\r\ncharite to be kept with our even cresten, have proposed to holde maynten\r\nand to kepe a Fraternyte within the chirch and cloyster of the Freres\r\nAustyn within the Cite of London in the worship and honor of the\r\nforesaid holy blode,” &c. The Ordinances as to benefits to be granted to\r\nthe brothers is as follows:--\r\n\r\nAnd also whan eny of our brethern happith to fall sike of som sikenesse\r\nthat comith of Gods hande, and not by no fawte of good governaunce and\r\ngood gydyng, he shall have for his sustenacion after that he hath lien\r\nvij. dayes xx_d_. every weke as long as he lieth sike, and his benefacte\r\nand charite shall perseyve as moche the moost as the lesse, to thend\r\nthis charite and almosse be not mynysshed be no wise, and whatever\r\nbrother of the same brotherhod that shall owe to the same as moche as\r\ncometh to more money than iiij_d_. _ob._ he shall not have nor perceyve\r\nthe forseyd benefacte and charite of the said Brotherhod.\r\n\r\nThe other Ordinances of this Gild are particularly interesting.\r\n\r\n(3) _The Fraternity of Saint Katheryn_, which is stated to have been\r\n“founded and ordeyned by Duchemenne iiijxx yeres passed in the Crosse\r\nFryers in the Cite of London.” This was enrolled in the Commissary Court\r\nof London Oct. 25, 1495 (10 Hen. VII.); and if it had only been founded\r\nby the Dutchmen eighty years previously, as its preamble recites, then\r\nit belongs to a later period than that of which we are writing. Another\r\nOrdinance, reciting that its earlier Ordinances, Acts, Constitutions,\r\nand Rules had been “specyfyed and declared in Duych tong,” points,\r\nhowever, to a probably earlier origin. The names enrolled look\r\nremarkably English-like for even the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n=Staines.=--In 1456 a licence was granted to John Lord Berners, Sir John\r\nWenlock, and other parishioners of Staines, to found a Gild or\r\nFraternity in honour of God and the Virgin Mary, in the Chapel of the\r\nHoly Cross, in the Church of Staines; which Gild should consist of two\r\nWardens and a certain number of brethren and sisters, who were\r\nincorporated by the King’s Letters Patent of that date. (_Vide_ Pat. 34\r\nHen. VI. m. 12.)\r\n\r\nIn 1548 the lands belonging to this Gild were valued at £11 17s. 6d. per\r\nannum, including 6s. 8d. for a Chamber called the Chantry Priests’\r\nChamber. (_Vide_ Chantry Roll in the Augmentation Office.)\r\n\r\nThese lands paid quit-rents to the manors of Grovebarns and Iveney\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n(_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE new parish church of Chiswick was consecrated by the Bishop of\r\nLondon on Saturday, August 2. The building, which occupies the site of\r\nthe old church, has been erected mainly at the cost of one of the\r\nchurch-wardens, Mr. Henry Smith. The old tower remains as it was. In the\r\nreconstruction of the church, the architect, Mr. J. L. Pearson, has\r\nendeavoured to indicate the leading characteristics of the old church,\r\nwhich dated from the early part of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAutograph Letters.\r\n\r\nNo. IV.--BISHOP SHERLOCK TO G. SHAKERLEY, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have often had a mind to write to you, since I heard of the\r\ngreat Calamity which happened to you and your family; but I always felt\r\nmyself so affected with the circumstances of that sad Case, which came\r\nfresh into my mind on every occasion, that I thought it would be showing\r\nbut little tenderness to renew your grief by expressing my own.\r\n\r\nThere is, in the misfortunes of life, a mixture of good providence, if\r\nattended to. In your Case, the escape which some of your family had was\r\nas wonderfull and providential as the Calamity was great and terrible.\r\n\r\nWhenever such accidents happen the trial is very great, but it cannot\r\nbut afford great comfort to a serious mind, to observe the hand of\r\nprovidence interposing to ward off that part of the distress, which of\r\nall others would have been the most insupportable. Tho’ exposed to\r\ndanger you was not without help; though greatly afflicted, yet not\r\nforsaken; a consideration which will support the spirit of a Man, not\r\nonly when his goods leave him, but, when the time comes that he must\r\nleave them.\r\n\r\nI have inquired after you and your good Lady from everybody, who was\r\nable to give me any account; and it has been a great Comfort to me to\r\nhear that you support yourselves under this great affliction by\r\nreflecting on God’s great goodness in preserving the lives of yourselves\r\nand your Children. To be insensible of such Calamitys is stupidity; but\r\nto bear them and not sink under them is the spirit of a Man. To submit\r\nto them patiently is the spirit of the Gospel. I trust the God who has\r\nsaved your lives, will also make them comfortable to you, by supporting\r\nyou under this trial; That he may do so is my constant prayer for you.\r\n\r\nI desire you would give my service to your good Lady. I know this trial\r\ndid not find her unprepared, And I hope the many hours She has spent in\r\nserious and religious reflections will be a comfort and a support to her\r\nnow. My service attends the young Ladies. I heartily rejoice in their\r\ndeliverance. Poor Miss Fanny! how often have I thought of her.\r\n\r\nMy Wife desires her service to you and Lady and the young Ladies. She\r\nhas truly been a partaker of the grief of her good friends.\r\n\r\nI am, Dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient humble servant,\r\n  T. SARUM.\r\n\r\nTo G. Shakerley, Esq.\r\n\r\n     [This letter was addressed to Mr. Shakerley, a connection of the\r\n     Wyan family, on the destruction of his mansion, Gwersylt,\r\n     Denbighshire, in 1738.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Early Church History, to the Death of Constantine._ Compiled by\r\n     the late EDWARD BACKHOUSE. Edited and enlarged by CHARLES TAYLOR.\r\n     Hamilton, Adams & Co. 1884.\r\n\r\nMR. EDWARD BACKHOUSE, the original compiler of the work now before us,\r\nand of whom a biographical sketch is given, was a native of Darlington,\r\nand a member of the Society of Friends. He died in 1879. His object in\r\ncommencing the compilation of this work is best told in his own words:\r\n“In second month, 1874, or about that period, I was standing painting in\r\nmy own room, when an impression was made upon my mind, which I believed\r\nto be from the Lord, that I ought to devote my leisure in my latter days\r\nto writing a portion of Church history; especially with a view of\r\nexhibiting to the Christian world, in a popular manner, the principles\r\nand practices of the Society of Friends. So I forthwith began to explore\r\nChurch history generally, because the history of Friends was quite\r\nfamiliar to me; and, ultimately, as I saw that I greatly differed from\r\nmany excellent historians in the inferences I drew from many events in\r\nthe history of the Church, I was induced to attempt myself to write a\r\nhistory of Christianity, which I thought might prove useful to some as\r\nexhibiting the principles and practices of the Churches, viewed from a\r\nQuaker standpoint, and compared as nearly as I could with apostolic\r\nprecedent.” With this view he studied the Anti-Nicene Christian Library,\r\nand read the ecclesiastical histories of Eusebius, Socrates,\r\nScholasticus, Sozomen, and Theodoret; and among modern compilations made\r\nuse of Du Pin, Mosheim, Neander, Burton’s Church History, and some\r\nothers. The work is illustrated by several photographs of Roman\r\nantiquities, &c., including the Arch of Titus, the corridor and\r\nstaircase in the Catacomb of Pontianus, and fragments of sculpture of\r\nthe fourth and fifth centuries.\r\n\r\n     _Les écrits de Leonardo da Vinci._ Par Ch. RAVAISSON-MOLLIEN. 8vo.\r\n     Paris: Quantin.\r\n\r\n     _Les Manuscrits de Leonardo da Vinci._ Publiés par CHARLES\r\n     RAVAISSON-MOLLIEN. Folio. Vols. i. and ii. Paris: Quantin.\r\n\r\n     _Conjecturers à propos d’un buste en marbre de Béatrix d’Este,\r\n     etc._ Par LOUIS COURAJOD et CHARLES RAVAISSON-MOLLIEN. 8vo. Paris:\r\n     Rapilly.\r\n\r\nWE have received from Paris two most interesting works in connection\r\nwith the great Italian artist, Leonardo da Vinci; they are the\r\nproduction of M. Ravaisson-Mollien, who has devoted all his time, his\r\nenergies, and his learning to the editing of the Vinci MSS. preserved at\r\nthe library of the French “Institut” in Paris.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to go here over the ground occupied by our author in\r\nhis preliminary _brochure_, and to give the history of the MSS. in\r\nquestion. Suffice it to say that at an early time they were scattered\r\nthroughout the principal collections in Europe, and that the fears\r\nentertained by Leonardo da Vinci himself respecting the non-publication\r\nof his numerous treatises on art and on science seemed likely to be\r\nfulfilled. No sooner had death removed Francisco Melzi, Leonardo’s\r\nfavourite pupil and friend, than the invaluable codices entrusted to his\r\ncare were dispersed and mutilated; as even one single page would fetch a\r\nconsiderable sum of money, the MSS. were broken up into small\r\nfragments, so as to satisfy the curiosity of the greatest possible\r\nnumber of amateurs; and in order to obtain any given work in its\r\ncomplete form, it would be necessary to seek the elements of that work\r\nat Milan, Windsor, and Kensington. Numerous treatises have thus been\r\nlost or are perhaps buried under the dust of public and private\r\nlibraries, and the materials now at our disposal represent only a small\r\npart of the whole collection, such as Francisco Melzi originally\r\npossessed it, and such as in all probability the artistic world will not\r\nsee it again.\r\n\r\nBy a piece of singular good luck the “Institut de France” possesses\r\ntwelve volumes of Leonardo da Vinci’s writings; they were indexed\r\ntowards the end of the last century by an Italian _savant_, named\r\nVenturi, who had examined them carefully, and had even published some\r\nextracts from them; these volumes are lettered A--M, and have the great\r\nmerit of giving the consecutive views of the author on the subjects\r\nwhich he had studied. This point is of the highest importance in the\r\ncase of a man such as Leonardo da Vinci, who lost no opportunity of\r\nshowing the interdependence of the several branches of science, and the\r\nlight they all throw upon one another. M. Ravaisson-Mollien has\r\naccordingly undertaken the arduous task of editing the entire works of\r\nLeonardo da Vinci, so far at least as they are known to exist, and we\r\nearnestly trust that he may be able to accomplish his rather ambitious\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\nThe first two volumes of the entire collection are now before the\r\npublic, and thus we are to a certain extent in a position to appreciate\r\nM. Ravaisson-Mollien’s qualities as an editor; we feel no hesitation in\r\nsaying honestly that they are all that one could wish, and we do so the\r\nmore readily because he has been attacked in the most unjust manner by\r\nM. J. P. Richter, whose English edition of the Windsor MSS. was brought\r\nout some little time ago. _Errare humanum est_ is a motto the\r\napplication of which is especially true in the case of the Vinci MSS.;\r\nM. Ravaisson-Mollien himself acknowledges frankly that he may have, and\r\nthat he has probably, been guilty of a few mistakes; but that the\r\nprinciples by which he is guided in his task are perfectly sound we do\r\nnot entertain the slightest doubt, and without prolonging the discussion\r\nany further we shall merely refer the reader to the articles in the\r\n_Times_ newspaper for January last, the Italian _Nuova Antologia_ for\r\nOctober, 1883, and the _Journal des Savants_ for July, 1882.\r\n\r\nOur business is more especially with the second volume of the\r\ncollection, but it will not be amiss to remind our friends of what are\r\nthe contents of the first. In addition to several passages already\r\npublished but given more correctly here, and bearing upon drawing,\r\npainting, sculpture, and hydraulics, we have the commencement of a\r\ntreatise on perspective, together with essays on movement, weight,\r\npercussion, projectiles, heat, light, sound, astronomy, cosmology, and\r\ngeography. The Italian text, reproduced in _fac-simile_ by photography,\r\nis printed on parallel pages with a literal French translation, and an\r\nexcellent bibliographical preface describes, not only the twelve codices\r\nof the French Institute, but all the other MSS., either complete or\r\nfragmentary, which are dispersed throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nThe second volume is the reproduction of Codices B and D; the former of\r\nthese is generally regarded as the gem of the whole collection, on\r\naccount of the beauty, energy, elegance, and variety of the sketches\r\nwhich illustrate it, whilst the latter seems to be a corrected or\r\nrevised copy of one of the chapters in Leonardo da Vinci’s treatise on\r\npainting, a treatise in which some curious and valuable remarks on\r\noptics serve as an introduction to the author’s lecture (if we may so\r\nsay) on perspective. Nothing but the actual inspection of this\r\nmagnificent folio can give the slightest idea of the artistic finish\r\nwhich characterises it, and of the extreme variety of its contents. From\r\nconsiderations on morality, on the soul, and on the spiritual world,\r\nLeonardo da Vinci goes on to examine questions on architecture,\r\nsculpture, agriculture, roads, draining, &c. &c., he discusses the\r\npossibility of aerial locomotion, describes the systems of warfare\r\nadopted by the ancients, dwells at some length on the properties of\r\nsteam, and explains the theory of the camera-obscura. The _fac-similes_\r\nare 188 in number; a very complete alphabetical index, preceded by the\r\nerrata of the two first volumes, terminates this second instalment.\r\n\r\nBefore bringing to a close this very imperfect notice we must mention a\r\n_brochure_ recently published containing, first, an article by M.\r\nCourajod on a marble bust of Beatrice d’Este, preserved at the museum of\r\nthe Louvre, and which, if not the work of Leonardo da Vinci, was\r\ncertainly executed by one of his pupils; secondly, an essay by M.\r\nRavaisson-Mollien on the great artist’s botanical knowledge, together\r\nwith a letter of M. Fillon treating of the same subject.\r\n\r\nLet us, in conclusion, pay a just tribute of praise to the liberality\r\nwith which M. Quantin, the publisher, has facilitated the production of\r\nthis splendid monument raised to the memory of Leonardo da Vinci.\r\n\r\nIN _English Etchings_, Part xl. (D. Bogue, 3, St. Martin’s-place), we\r\nhave another of those beautifully executed “bits” of “Old London” which\r\nare worth preserving, before they are swept away to make room for\r\n“improvements.” The spot represented is that portion of Lower\r\nThames-street opposite Billingsgate. The church of St. Magnus, close by\r\nLondon-bridge, forms the centre of the picture. This is one of Wren’s\r\nchurches, and was built in 1676, the old church, which was founded at\r\nthe beginning of the fourteenth century, having been destroyed in the\r\nGreat Fire of 1666. The etching is the work of Mr. Frank J. Short, and\r\nis most effective in its treatment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: text decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObituary Memoirs.\r\n\r\n     “Emori nolo; sed me esse mortuum nihil æstimo.”--_Epicharmus._\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. THOMAS W. LIDDERDALE, for over thirty years an officer of the\r\nBritish Museum, and latterly a first-class assistant in the Printed Book\r\nDepartment, died suddenly in the Strand, on September 4, when returning\r\nhome from his ordinary duties. Mr. Lidderdale was a scholar of rare\r\nattainments in Scandinavian literature, and particularly in the more\r\ncontracted sphere of Icelandic bibliography.\r\n\r\nTHE death is recorded of M. STANISLAS GUYARD, a distinguished Semitic\r\nscholar. At the end of last year he was appointed Professor of Arabic at\r\nthe Collége de France, in succession to the late M. Defrémery. His\r\npublications on the language and literature of the Arabs have been\r\nnumerous; but to English readers it will be enough to point out his\r\ngreat article on “The Eastern Caliphate,” in the sixteenth volume of the\r\nnew edition of the “Encyclopædia Britannica.” His interests, says the\r\n_Academy_, were by no means confined to Arabic. He had recently taken up\r\nwith ardour the study of Assyrian. He shares with Professor Sayce the\r\ncredit of finding the interpretation of the mysterious inscriptions of\r\nVan; and, to the astonishment of English students, he declared himself\r\na convert to the theory of M. Halévy--that the so-called “Accadian” of\r\nthe cuneiform tablets is no language at all, but only a secret mode of\r\nwriting Assyrian. M. Guyard was assistant secretary and librarian of the\r\nSociété Asiatique, and one of the four editors of the _Revue Critique_.\r\nHe died by his own hand at Paris, in his forty-first year.\r\n\r\nMR. E. A. ROY, Assistant-Keeper of the Printed Books in the Library of\r\nthe British Museum, died on August 14, aged 64. Mr. Roy had been\r\nemployed at the British Museum since 1841, and was appointed by Mr.\r\nWinter Jones, the Principal Librarian, in 1871, to the post of\r\nAssistant-Keeper of Printed Books, a post then specially created for an\r\nofficer charged with the superintendence and acceleration of the\r\nprogress of the catalogue of books and final revision of the titles.\r\n\r\nMR. HENRY G. BOHN, F.S.A., the oldest bookseller and publisher, and\r\nhimself the author of sundry “Handbooks” of London, of Games, &c., died\r\nat the age of 88, at Twickenham, on the 22nd August. He first brought\r\nhis name into notice by his “Guinea Catalogue of old English Books,”\r\nwhich he printed in 1841; to our readers he will be best known by his\r\n“Historical” and “Antiquarian” Libraries.\r\n\r\nTHE death is announced of Mr. JAMES NAPIER, of Stonehaven, author of two\r\nlocal historical works, entitled “Stonehaven and its Historical\r\nAssociations,” and “The Honours of Scotland,” the latter being an\r\naccount of the preservation of the Scottish regalia when Dunottar Castle\r\nwas besieged by the army of the Commonwealth in 1651.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeetings of Learned Societies.\r\n\r\nMETROPOLITAN.\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH ARCHÆOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE forty-first annual congress of this Association commenced at Tenby,\r\non Tuesday, September 2, the Bishop of St. David’s presiding. The\r\nreception of the members, by the Mayor and Corporation of Tenby, took\r\nplace at the Town-hall, where the maces and regalia of Tenby, Pembroke,\r\nand Haverfordwest, which were exhibited, were made the subject of some\r\nobservations by Mr. George Lambert, F.S.A., who said that the last two\r\nwere of the reign of Charles I., while those of Tenby were later. All\r\nthree, he said, were in poor condition. The Bishop then delivered his\r\ninaugural address, in the course of which he expressed his belief that\r\nsince he took part in a meeting of the Cambrian Archæological Society at\r\nTenby some twenty years ago antiquarian research had begun to take rank\r\nas a science, having ceased to content itself with collecting dry facts\r\nand having begun to systematise them in an orderly manner. He drew\r\nattention to the character of the county which they were about to visit,\r\nwhich, though it might be somewhat poor in its churches, was so rich in\r\ncastles that it might almost be styled their paradise. These castles\r\nwere well worthy of attention, for even in their ruins they served to\r\nillustrate history, showing, as they did, that the feudal nobles who\r\ninhabited them were almost princes in their independence, like those of\r\nthe northern borderland, and for the same reason--namely, their great\r\ndistance from the central seat of royal authority. He ended his address\r\nby some excellent remarks on the five leading eras to which the\r\nantiquities of Pembrokeshire might be referred--the pre-historic, the\r\nRoman, the Anglo-Saxon, the mediæval, and the post-Reformation periods\r\nrespectively; adding, at the same time, some remarks upon his own\r\ncathedral of St. David and its surroundings, its peculiar grandeur and\r\ncharm of grace, instancing it and Bishop Gower’s Palace close by as the\r\nfinest specimens of mediæval architecture, ecclesiastical and domestic,\r\nto be seen in the Principality.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the afternoon was spent by the members of the congress in\r\nthe inspection of the various objects of antiquarian interest in which\r\nthe town abounds, notably its ancient walls, which, if they are not so\r\nstrong or so ancient as those of York, are of a good and original type.\r\nThey are fairly perfect on the western and northern sides of the town,\r\nand probably were never built on the east and south sides, where the\r\ncliffs, rising abruptly out of the sea, were a sufficient protection.\r\nThe leading features of these fortifications were explained by Mr.\r\nEdward Laws, a local antiquary, who has acted as local secretary to the\r\npresent congress, and has the antiquities of Tenby at his fingers’ ends.\r\nThe company also inspected several arched vaults, Gothic windows,\r\nornamental chimneys, and other architectural details in various houses\r\nin the town. They also visited the local museum, where the civic\r\ncharters of Tenby and other curious specimens of antiquarian lore were\r\non view. These found an expounder in Mr. Walter De Gray Birch, of the\r\nBritish Museum, who pronounced them far above the average in interest,\r\nthough not in good preservation. At the church the party were met by the\r\nrector, the Rev. G. Huntington, who pointed out to them a number of fine\r\neffigies and other monuments, especially the curiously sculptured\r\nalabaster memorial to John and Thomas White, enterprising and opulent\r\nmerchants of the town, one of whom was of great service to Henry VII.,\r\nwhen he was only Earl of Richmond, in enabling him to make his escape by\r\nsea to France--a service for which he was afterwards rewarded by a Royal\r\ngrant of land. Amongst the other tombs that were inspected was that of\r\nWilliam Risam (A.D. 1633), in the attitude of prayer; that of Walter\r\nVaughan, of Dunraven, a noted wrecker; and, perhaps the most interesting\r\nof all, a marble effigy of a skeleton in a recess in the wall near the\r\nnorth door--probably erected by a priest as a _memento mori_. The\r\ncurious figures supporting the roof of the chancel, the ogee arch over\r\nthe western doorway, the old aumbries, the fine wooden roof, and\r\nentrance to the rood-screen, were all much admired, as were also the\r\nremains of a Carmelite priory adjacent to the west end of the fabric.\r\nThese were commented on by the Rector and by Mr. Loftus Brock, who gave\r\ngood reasons for believing that the church was erected in detail at\r\nvarious dates, as the necessity for enlargement arose, and stated that\r\nSt. Mary’s, Tenby, was not only one of the finest of Pembrokeshire\r\nchurches, but also a very excellent example of what a town church ought\r\nto be. Before leaving the church the Bishop moved a vote of thanks to\r\nMr. Brock for his valuable and most suggestive paper. The day’s\r\nproceedings were brought to a close by a dinner at the Temperance Hall,\r\nat which nearly a hundred sat down.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, at Brownslade, their first halting-place, through the\r\nkindness of the Hon. Colonel Lambton, a raised tumulus, which had long\r\nbeen suspected to be a barrow, was opened, and at a distance of little\r\nmore than 2 ft. below the turf a variety of human bones were brought to\r\nlight, and, amongst others, the skeleton of a very tall man, which was\r\nlaid bare before the eyes of the assembled congress, the rough stones\r\nwhich had covered the bones being carefully removed. As the body lay\r\nexactly east and west, it was surmised that it must be that of a\r\nChristian; and, if so, then it clearly must be of post-Roman date. This\r\nsupposition was confirmed by the discovery of some crosses and other\r\nemblems of Christianity being found among the bones in the neighbouring\r\ngraves, which were grouped thickly around. In some of these the bones\r\nwere thrown in apparently at random, and others were found in a crawling\r\nposture, so that in all probability the cemetery had been used for\r\nheathen interments before the Christians made use of it. At a short\r\ndistance to the north were seen the _débris_ of what was thought, from\r\nits orientation, to have been a chapel or church, though the masonry\r\nshowed marks of Roman mortar and handiwork. Between the church and the\r\nabove-mentioned tumulus the surface of the ground is very uneven, rising\r\nevery here and there into hillocks, and it was thought probable that\r\nfurther excavations, if carried out, would probably reveal here the\r\nexistence of an early British village. At Brownslade Mr. E. Laws and Mr.\r\nLoftus Brock and the Dean of St. David’s acted as interpreters and\r\nguides. The dean also accompanied the party to the next halting-place,\r\nthe church of Castle Martin, a miniature reproduction in some respects\r\nof St. David’s Cathedral. Here the dean drew the attention of the\r\ncongress to the south porch, in which were the remains of what certainly\r\nlooks like a rood-loft, though why a rood-loft should be introduced into\r\na porch it is not easy to determine. The Norman font, the tall slim\r\ntower, and other features of the church were much admired. The visitors\r\nalso inspected the old vicarage, adjoining the church, now inhabited as\r\na cottage. In it they saw a pillar of apparently Norman date, and having\r\non its capital grotesque sculptures.\r\n\r\nAfterwards the party drove on, under the guidance of Mr. E. Scott, to\r\nAngle, or Nangle, a village prettily situated on an arm of Milford\r\nHaven, and famous as having been once the home of Giraldus Cambrensis.\r\nHere they were shown the remains of a curiously fortified rectory-house\r\n(not unlike one of the smaller “Peel” castles of the northern border\r\ncounties), consisting of a tower with Gothic windows, and elegantly\r\nadorned with carvings. Close by it is a round dovecote, probably coeval\r\nwith the rectory, and dating from the Edwardian era. They also inspected\r\na little detached mortuary chapel, with a crypt below, which stands in\r\nthe churchyard a little to the north of the sacred edifice. On their way\r\nthence to Ross-Crowther the party visited a curious cromlech on Newton\r\nBurrows. At Ross-Crowther itself they were received by the rector, the\r\nRev. Mr. Scott, who entertained the whole party at tea in his garden. He\r\nalso showed them a curiously engraved stone (possibly of Roman origin)\r\nwhich is worked into the wall at the entrance of the churchyard, and a\r\nfine stone cross in the churchyard, remarkable as still having a perfect\r\ncavity in which money was dropped as offerings to the preacher. The\r\naltar slab, the low-browed arches, the font, and other portions of the\r\nchurch were much admired, as also was the “sanctus” bell, which still\r\nhangs outside the roof at the eastern end of the nave.\r\n\r\nThe party walked across the fields from the rectory in order to visit\r\nthe fortified manor-house of Jestington, or Eastington, one of the most\r\nsingular structures in this part of Wales. It is remarkable for its\r\nexternal staircase of stone, and for the curious patterns in which its\r\nstone floor is laid down. From Eastington the drive was made on the\r\nreturn journey to Pembroke, whence the members of the Congress were\r\nconveyed by train to Tenby. Owing to the late hour of their return only\r\none paper was read at the evening meeting--namely, by Mr. Arthur Cope,\r\nupon the subject of “Little England beyond Wales.” The reading of this\r\npaper was followed by an animated discussion, in which Mr. G. Lambert,\r\nMr. E. Loftus Brock, and other gentlemen took part.\r\n\r\nThursday was devoted to a long drive by carriages to Manorbeer Castle\r\nand Lamphey Palace. On their way to the former they paid a visit to\r\nLydsted, a quaint little place on the coast, where their attention was\r\nattracted by some curious ancient specimens of domestic architecture. At\r\nManorbeer Mr. E. Loftus Brock explained all the details of this most\r\ninteresting structure, more remarkable for its picturesque position at\r\nthe head of an inland bay than for its strength, as it is commanded on\r\nalmost every side by hills which would place it at the mercy of heavy\r\ncannon. The castle is approached by a drawbridge, which spans a moat now\r\ndry. Crossing this and passing through the fortified entrance gateway,\r\nthe visitor finds himself in the outer bailey, with the windows of the\r\nchapel, the hall, the kitchen, and the other domestic offices facing\r\nhim. His attention cannot fail to be arrested by the external stone\r\nstaircases which lead up to these rooms. Between the hall and the chapel\r\nis a large apartment, which probably was used as a drawing-room. Here,\r\nas in the chapel, the vaulting of the roof remains, as also do the\r\nchimneys in the hall; the dais also can be traced, and the stairs\r\nleading up from the kitchen are nearly perfect. Much has been done of\r\nlate years to show the proportions of the chapel by removing the bricks\r\nand plaster with which its chancel windows were blocked up. The walls\r\nare almost entire, and so are the ramparts which run round them\r\ninternally, thus placing both ends of the castle in immediate\r\ncommunication with each other, and both with the centre--an arrangement\r\nvery useful in the time of constant wars and forays. Mr. Brock was able\r\nto show that the walls were of different date, the original Norman walls\r\nhaving been raised, apparently twice, in order to secure additional\r\ndefence. Some controversy arose at the end of Mr. Brock’s remarks as to\r\nthe meaning of the latter portion of the word “manorbeer,” and Sir James\r\nPicton, suggested that as the castle was under the Edwards the property\r\nof the family of Barry, or Berry, of which Giraldus Cambrensis was a\r\nmember, it might mean the manor house of the Berrys; but this was\r\nnegatived by the Vicar, the Rev. A. H. Wratislaw, who stated that in old\r\ncollege documents there was no reference to the Barry family, and that\r\nthere is still in the parish a farm termed Beer, to which possibly the\r\nlands now covered by the castle belonged. On leaving the castle the\r\nparty proceeded to the church, which stands on a lofty eminence looking\r\ndown upon the castle and the sea. The many singular points in its\r\nstructure, its utter irregularity of plan, the strange, heavy arches on\r\neither side of its nave, the large rood-loft in the north aisle, and the\r\nequally large “hagioscope” in the south aisle, and the knightly figure\r\nin armour on the north side of the communion rails, were all in turn\r\ncommented upon by the Rev. Mr. Wratislaw in an address which he\r\ndelivered in the nave. The party next hastily inspected the ruins of the\r\nold priory and the old rectory house adjoining the church on the south,\r\nand then proceeded on foot along the edge of the cliffs to see a\r\ncromlech, which is famous throughout the neighbourhood. It much\r\nresembles those seen in Cornwall, consisting of two short upright\r\nstones, supporting another flat stone of larger size. This was probably\r\nused for the purposes of sepulture in prehistoric times. Returning to\r\nthe village the party took their luncheon in the schoolroom, which was\r\nplaced at their disposal by the Vicar. After this they drove on in\r\ntheir brakes and waggonettes to Hodgeston, where they inspected the\r\nchurch, and duly admired the richly-carved sedilia, piscina, and\r\ndecorated chancel, for which it is famous among Pembrokeshire churches.\r\nFrom Hodgeston their route led them to Lamphey, one of several palaces\r\nonce belonging to the see of St. David’s, though separated from it by\r\nHenry VIII. at the Reformation, and since allowed to go to ruin by the\r\nDevereuxes, to whom it was first granted, and by subsequent owners down\r\nto the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, to whom it now belongs. The old\r\nhall, with its long and fine arcade of windows--an emulation, or rather\r\na reproduction on a smaller scale, of Bishop Gower’s Palace of St.\r\nDavid’s--and the chapel, with its elegant east window, were both much\r\nadmired, and great regret was expressed at the ruin caused by courtiers\r\nto sacred buildings which the ancient Church did its best to preserve.\r\nFrom Lamphey the return journey was made along the ridgway to Tenby, but\r\nin their way back the archæologists paid a short and hasty visit to\r\nPenally Abbey, only a small portion of which--namely, St. David’s\r\nChapel--now remains. It stands in private grounds, and the chapel is now\r\na fernery, of which the gardener is very proud. The church, which is\r\nsmall, and has lately been renovated and adorned with painted windows,\r\nwas much admired, and so were the crosses in the churchyard. The party\r\nreached Tenby between seven and eight o’clock, and at the evening\r\nmeeting papers were read by Sir James Picton on “Place Names and their\r\nTeachings, especially with reference to Pembrokeshire,” and by Mr.\r\nEdward Laws on “The Local Ethnology of the District.” The former paper\r\ngave rise to a long and interesting discussion.\r\n\r\nOn Friday the archæologists had a long and pleasant day. Reaching\r\nPembroke by special train soon after ten o’clock, they found their\r\ncarriages ready to convey them to the Stack Rocks and to Stackpole\r\nCourt, Lord Cawdor’s noble seat, near the southern coast of\r\nPembrokeshire. They reached the cliffs in good time, and saw them in\r\ntheir entire stretch from Linney Head to St. Govan’s Head, and were\r\nshown in turn the Caldrons, Bullslaughter Bay, the Hunter’s Leap, and\r\nthe other points which are so familiar to tourists in these parts. The\r\nsea was quite calm, and the sky was bright, so that the party were\r\nspecially favoured in point of weather. They were most pleased, however,\r\nwith St. Govan’s Chapel, which is situated about half-way down the\r\ncliffs in a narrow gorge, which it almost entirely blocked up. Here it\r\nis said that St. Govan was miraculously brought, and still more\r\nmiraculously preserved from his enemies, and here he spent many years in\r\nfasting and prayer. The rooms which served as his dwelling and his\r\noratory are partly hewn out of the solid rock, and partly built into it\r\nand on it. The window is primitive in its simplicity, and the roof with\r\nits little bell turret above is all that shows us now that it was a\r\nchapel once. Close by it and almost forming part of it is a rock, in\r\nwhich there is a hollow cavity just large enough for a person to stand\r\nin it; and there is a firm and fixed belief in the neighbourhood that\r\nwhoever, whilst inside of it, makes a wish, turning himself or herself,\r\nas the case may be, round three times, will see that wish gratified\r\nwithin the next twelvemonth. From St. Govan’s Head the party passed\r\nalong the cliff, inspecting very briefly a Danish encampment which\r\noccupies one of the bold headlands close by. In their way from St.\r\nGovan’s to Stackpole the archæologists paid a visit to Bosherston\r\nChurch, where the tall tapering tower and the interior monuments,\r\nincluding two recumbent figures, a knight and a lady in stone, under\r\nnoble canopies, were much admired. The church in other respects\r\nscarcely differs from the ordinary type so common all over the southern\r\nportion of Pembrokeshire. From Bosherston they drove on to Stackpole\r\nCourt, the seat of Lord Cawdor, where they were not sorry to find\r\nluncheon awaiting them. Some of the party were content to inspect the\r\nstate rooms of this lordly mansion, and to admire the family portraits\r\nby Sir Joshua Reynolds, Romney, and Sir Thomas Lawrence, and the stands\r\nof arms which were used by the late Lord Cawdor’s regiment of militia in\r\nrepelling the descent of the French troops at Fishguard, or taken from\r\ntheir prisoners. Meantime the more adventurous portion of the party\r\nwalked across the park, under the guidance of Colonel and Lady Victoria\r\nLambton, to inspect the site of a supposed pre-historic British village\r\non the high ground about half-way between the Court and the sea cliffs.\r\nThe remains are very irregular in plan, and from what is seen above\r\nground it is difficult to make out their use, for they are scarcely\r\nstrong enough to support roofs, and so could hardly serve for the\r\npurpose of domestic life. It was thought by some of those present that\r\nthey were intended as places of safety for their oxen and flocks, and\r\nthat the sites of their dwellings were a little further towards the sea.\r\nThe subject, however, is reserved for future discussion, as soon as some\r\nfurther excavations can be made by Lord Cawdor, Colonel Lambton, and Mr.\r\nE. Laws. The large quantities of bones, burnt and calcined, of flints\r\ncut for arrow-heads, &c., found just under the turf led the\r\narchæologists to believe that further excavations would probably be\r\nfound productive of satisfactory results; and one thing was regarded as\r\ncertain--namely, that in very distant ages these bleak and barren\r\nsea-cliffs bristled with a native population. In returning through the\r\npark the party were shown some specimens of a breed of white cattle\r\nwhich are said to have been here from the Danish and British times, not\r\nunlike those at Chillingham Castle, in Northumberland, but smaller and\r\nnot so fierce. The return drive was accomplished in good time to\r\nPembroke, the party being able _en route_ just to take a hasty glance at\r\nCheriton Church, which has been lately restored by Lord Cawdor, and is\r\nremarkable for the noble monuments, under sculptured canopies, which it\r\ncontains. They much admired the monument of Sir Elias de Stackpole, who\r\ntook the cross and went off to Palestine, being led thereto by the\r\npreaching of Archbishop Baldwin; and also an ivy-crowned stone cross,\r\nwhich stands in the churchyard, apparently unmutilated. The papers read\r\nat the evening meeting in the Town-hall, Tenby, were two--the first by\r\nMr. Thomas Morgan on “The Plantagenets,” and the other on “The Flemings\r\nin England and their Architecture,” by the Rev. Osborn Allen. The latter\r\nwas followed by a long and interesting discussion.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday morning, in spite of the wetness of the day, about sixty of\r\nthe members of the Congress started in carriages for Gumfreston and St.\r\nFlorence, _en route_ for Carew and Upton Castles. Arrived at Gumfreston,\r\nthey were received at the church by the Rector and by Mr. Edward Laws,\r\nwho had acted throughout as local secretary and _cicerone_. Here Mr.\r\nCharles Lynam read a paper upon the structural peculiarities and\r\nhistorical associations of the church, for which he received a special\r\nvote of thanks. The sanctus bell, the piscina, and the baptistery were\r\nmuch admired. From Gumfreston the party drove through drenching showers\r\nof rain to St. Florence, where they minutely inspected the church,\r\nwhich, like its neighbour they had just left, is an excellent specimen\r\nof the usual Pembrokeshire church, with heavy walls and stone roof, and\r\nlow depressed arches of early date in the chancel and transepts. The\r\nvicar, the Rev. Eric Rudd, here showed to the party the remains of a\r\nholy water stoup and of a stone cross which had not long since been\r\nunearthed in the immediate neighbourhood. Mr. Brock also made some\r\nremarks upon the fabric, and the parties inspected the remains of an old\r\nFlemish house close by. From St. Florence they drove on to Carew Castle,\r\nwhich was the principal attraction in the day’s programme. Less in size\r\nthan, and not equal in situation to, Manorbeer, Carew Castle--which, by\r\nthe way, is generally styled Carey in Pembrokeshire--is not inferior to\r\nit in historic interest. It was the original fortress of the ancient\r\nPrinces of Wales when they were independent of the British Crown, and,\r\nas the home of the earlier of the Tudors, it holds a high rank among the\r\nhistoric castles of the Principality. It passed, by the marriage of an\r\nheiress, to one of the Geralds or FitzGeralds, who was castellan of\r\nPembroke Castle, and it is famed in comparatively recent times as having\r\nbeen the place where one of the Welsh lords, Sir Rhys ap Thomas,\r\nreceived Henry of Richmond when he landed in these parts on his way to\r\nwin the battle of Bosworth Field. Here, therefore, the party were glad\r\nto lunch, being hospitably entertained, by the courtesy of Mr. Charles\r\nAllen, in the ruined and windowless, but, happily, not roofless chapel.\r\nThe outlines of Carew Castle are so familiar to the Cambrian traveller\r\nthat we need not attempt to describe them in detail; sufficient to say\r\nthat it stands at the extreme end of one of the many “tentacles” of\r\nMilford Haven, which washes the bases of its northern and western\r\ntowers. The great “Edwardian” banqueting hall, with its fine flight of\r\nstone steps externally, still frowns down upon the visitor in the\r\nquadrangle, reminding him of many details of Ludlow and Berry Pomeroy.\r\nOn his right are the remains, roofless, of the state apartments, very\r\nmagnificent in their decay, not unlike those of Kenilworth. Of the\r\nchapel but little is to be seen externally, though it is interesting\r\nenough in its interior details. “The inner face of the western side of\r\nthe Castle Court,” writes Murray, “is the most modern of the whole, and\r\nis said to have been built by Sir Rhys ap Thomas, in a rich form of late\r\nPerpendicular architecture; it proclaims by its style that it was\r\nerected during the reign of one of the Tudors. It must have been a\r\nstructure of great magnificence, though now reduced to a mere shell.”\r\nThis wing was evidently built without any view to defence, though placed\r\nin connection with the towers at either end rising out of the water. On\r\nthe whole, it is not in so good a condition as Manorbeer, and is not so\r\nwell looked after or so tenderly “preserved.” The party inspected also,\r\nunder the guidance of the Vicar, Carew Church, and were shown the\r\nremains of a small disused chapel, near at hand. Mr. Loftus Brock here\r\noffered a few remarks on the details of both these interesting\r\nstructures, the church having, unlike the rest of those the party had\r\nlately visited, a Perpendicular tower. Near the Carew Arms Hotel the\r\nparty were shown an old wayside cross, the inscription on which, in\r\nRunic characters, has long defied the efforts of scientific inquirers.\r\nMr. E. Laws, however, announced that it had been lately found to be a\r\nbrief record of the name of the person who erected it, and that it\r\nbelonged to a date when the Welsh were in close contact with the Irish.\r\nHe stated that the ornamentation of the cross, which is a megalith\r\nupwards of 12 ft. in height, is generally like that to be seen on the\r\ncrosses in the Isle of Man and in Ireland, in spite of some local\r\ndifferences of detail. In the course of the afternoon the party, having\r\nbeen refreshed by their luncheon, went on to Upton Castle, where they\r\nwere received by an Oxford professor of modern history, Mr. Henry\r\nHalford Vaughan, formerly fellow of Oriel College. This gentleman\r\nexplained to them the details of the structure, and showed them his\r\nlibrary. He also accompanied them to a disused church or chapel in his\r\ngrounds not far from the castle, where Colonel Bramble showed and\r\ncommented upon the effigy, in stone, of a member of the great\r\nPembrokeshire family of Malefort or Mallefort. At the conclusion of\r\ntheir inspection of the antiquities and curiosities of Upton, the party\r\ndrove across the country, along deep shady lanes, to Pembroke, where the\r\ntrain was waiting to take them back to Tenby in time for the evening\r\nmeeting. On this evening the Mayor took the chair, and a paper was read\r\nby Mr. E. Loftus Brock, F.S.A., upon “The Historical Evidences of the\r\nExtent of the Ancient British Church in Wales.” Mr. E. Laws said that it\r\nwould be more correct to call this Church Cwmric than British, and the\r\ndiscussion was continued until a late hour.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday the members of the Congress attended Divine service at the\r\nparish church at Tenby, where the rector, the Rev. G. Huntington,\r\npreached before them an eloquent sermon, most appropriate to the\r\noccasion, from the words of Jeremiah (vi. 16), “Stand ye in the old\r\npaths ... and ye shall find rest unto your souls.”[51]\r\n\r\nIn spite of a very wet morning on Monday, the members of the congress,\r\nto the number of nearly forty, proceeded, according to their programme,\r\nby special train to Pembroke, where Mr. E. Laws and Mr. Loftus Brock had\r\npromised to conduct them over the ruined fabric of the castle. Its site\r\nand exterior appearance need scarcely be described, so well are they\r\nknown to tourists; but it may be well to say that as at Manorbeer there\r\nis no history, because there were no events in the existence of the\r\ncastle, here the castle has a long and varied history, figuring in the\r\nearly wars which ended in the reduction of Wales under the English yoke,\r\nand also in the Great Rebellion, when it was held for the King, and was\r\ncaptured by the Parliamentary leaders, Oliver Cromwell himself having a\r\nhand in its reduction. The castle stands on a rocky peninsula, which is\r\nformed by two creeks of Milford Haven, which wash it on the north and\r\nwest. It thus occupies a very strong position, and though there is no\r\nactual proof of its having been occupied as a fortress by the Romans,\r\nyet there is every probability that such was the case. Soon after the\r\nNorman Conquest, however, it appears to have been fortified by Walter de\r\nMontgomery, and from that time down to the early part of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, when Henry VII. was born within its walls, it had a large share\r\nin the making of Welsh history. The castle, it is needless to add,\r\nthough well fortified by nature, was still more strongly fortified by\r\nart, and, indeed, was at one time regarded as almost impregnable. The\r\nouter defence consisted of a double entrance, the inner one at right\r\nangles to the former, in front of which was a drawbridge and a moat, now\r\nno longer in existence. The first, or outer court, by far the larger of\r\nthe two, was divided from the inner court or “bailey” by a wall, which\r\ncan still be traced. Near the juncture of the two stands the Norman\r\nkeep, which, unlike that of most similar structures, is circular instead\r\nof square. It is upwards of 70 ft. in height, and its walls at the base\r\nare nearly 17 ft. thick; it has a stone roof or covering of a conical or\r\ndome-like shape, reminding the visitor of the tower at the north-west\r\nangle of Windsor Castle. It is of five stages, and a stone staircase in\r\nthe wall led up to the “first floor apartments;” but, alas! the floors\r\nare all gone. Some fine, semi-Norman windows still remain _in situ_. In\r\nthe lower “bailey” is the old castle well, and near it a sally-port,\r\nwhich would stand the besieged in good stead in case of being reduced to\r\ntheir last shift within the walls. Near the central keep are the remains\r\nof the walls of other large apartments, but their actual use is\r\nuncertain, and the archæologists could throw little or no light upon\r\nthem. Not far to the east are the walls of what once was a magnificent\r\nbanqueting-hall, but there the devastation wrought by the hand of time\r\nis so extensive that it is almost impossible to decide which was the\r\nupper end of it, and where were the servants’ seats and the entrance to\r\nthe buttery and the kitchen. As for the chapel, two chambers were shown\r\nto the members of the congress, but so many objections were found to\r\neach that they were inclined to believe that it could never be found\r\nexcept by farther excavations. The company, in spite of the drenching\r\nrain, were able to “walk round the battlements and tell the towers\r\nthereof,” and to inspect the entrances of the dungeons and of the large\r\ncavity in the northern wall known as “The Wogan”--a place which, it is\r\nthought, may have served as a second sally-port, though others think\r\nthat it was the receptacle of a second well. Before leaving the party\r\nwere shown by Mr. E. Laws some of Oliver Cromwell’s cannon-balls of\r\nstone, which he was forced to have made on the spot in great haste in\r\norder to carry on the siege, as his store of ammunition which he had\r\nintended to use against the castle had been sunk by a storm in the\r\ndepths of the Bristol Channel. They were also shown the chamber in\r\nwhich, if the local tradition is to be believed, Henry of Richmond,\r\nafterwards King Henry VII., was born. Returning to the principal\r\nentrance, the party assembled in the room above the gateway to hear from\r\nMr. Loftus Brock a short description of the fabric, its history and\r\narchæology; and Mr. Brock, on behalf of the members, tendered his best\r\nthanks to Mr. Cobb and to the local committee for the care which they\r\nhave bestowed on the preservation of the fabric from further decay.\r\nLeaving the castle the party then walked round the outer walls by the\r\nside of the river, and so made their way across the bridge to Monkton.\r\nHere they had before them a great treat, for they saw together, under a\r\nsingle roof, the strange commixture of a parish church with a monastic\r\npriory chapel, the latter having been added to the former by the\r\nBenedictine monks when they were removed thither from the castle\r\nscarcely a century after the Norman Conquest. It appears that they\r\ndivided the two structures, which appeared respectively as a nave and a\r\nchancel, by a wall, which still remains _in situ_, at once separating\r\nand connecting them. The monastic church is of the Decorated style, with\r\nan east window not unlike one of the windows at Tintern Abbey. Close by\r\nit, and running parallel to it on the north, is the Lady-chapel, of\r\nabout the same date. These are both now roofless, but it is hoped that\r\nthe former may, ere long, be turned to good account, and be restored so\r\nas to form a chancel to the nave, which alone now serves as the\r\nparochial church. The chief obstacle to this is the wall built across\r\nthem at their juncture, and which is said to be “too good to destroy and\r\nyet too bad to keep.” Possibly, as suggested by Mr. Brock, the upper\r\npart of it might be removed, and the lower part pierced, so as to form a\r\nsort of light screen which shall offer no impediment to the voice. On\r\nleaving the church and chapels the party were conducted over the scanty\r\nremains of the old monastic buildings, which are still distinctly\r\ntraceable in the field to the north. They afterwards paid a hasty visit\r\nto the vicarage-house, which was once, they were told, the prior’s\r\nresidence, and which has every appearance of having once been fortified.\r\nIn its basement is a lofty, vaulted chamber, above which is a fine\r\ndining-hall, with its buttery-hatch as complete as it was four centuries\r\nago.\r\n\r\nAs soon as luncheon, of which they partook at an inn in the town, was\r\nover, the whole party returned by special train to Tenby in time for the\r\nconcluding meeting, which was held in the Town-hall, and was presided\r\nover by the Mayor. Here Mr. De Gray Birch read an interesting historical\r\npaper upon the Charters of Tenby, which he showed was variously spelt\r\nfrom the fifteenth to the eighteenth century. He said that, as compared\r\nwith those of other towns, the Charters of Tenby were both early and\r\ncurious, and, though they were not in so bad a state as many others,\r\nthey had suffered severely from neglect and from injudicious repairs, by\r\nexposure to damp, and by the absence of light and fresh air. Their value\r\nto the Town, he added, was incalculable, and their loss or further decay\r\nwould be equally to be regretted. Votes of thanks were passed to the\r\nMayor, to Mr. Edward Laws, to the Rector of Tenby, to the readers of\r\npapers, and to the various other gentlemen who had assisted in\r\nforwarding the interests and success of the congress, which then broke\r\nup, so far as Tenby was concerned; the archæologists intending to leave\r\nearly on Tuesday for Haverfordwest and St. David’s, where they would\r\nexamine the cathedral and the old episcopal palace, under the guidance\r\nof the Bishop and the Dean. An account of this portion of the\r\nproceedings will appear in our next number.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVINCIAL.\r\n\r\nBUCKS ARCHÆOLOGICAL SOCIETY.--On August 11, the members of the above\r\nSociety visited Buckingham, Maid’s Moreton, and Stowe House, making the\r\nBuckingham district the point for the annual excursion. The Vicar of\r\nBuckingham read a paper on the history of the Parish Church. Castle\r\nHouse was then inspected, the residence of Major Hearn, who gave a\r\ndescription of the place. The company then proceeded to Maid’s Moreton,\r\nwhere the church was the object of the visit, and at which place the\r\npages of the parish register were searched with much interest. On the\r\narrival at Stowe House the Duke of Buckingham received the company,\r\namounting to 150 visitors. After luncheon, his Grace read a paper on the\r\nhistory of the place. Some interesting points in Stowe Gardens were\r\nvisited, but time would not permit of a lengthened survey of the place.\r\nThe annual meeting of the Society was afterwards held. The Society\r\npromises more animation in future.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIAN ARCHÆOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION.--The thirty-ninth annual Congress of\r\nthis Association began on Monday, August 18, at Bala, under the\r\npresidency of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn. The report was adopted. On\r\nTuesday an excursion was made to Castell Carndochan, Caergai, and\r\nLlannwchllyn Church. At the first-named place the Rev. W. Hughes, the\r\nlocal secretary, read a paper in which he referred to the leading\r\nobjects of the day’s excursion. “Llannwchllyn,” he remarked, “was\r\nderived from its position above Bala Lake: _Llan-nwch-y-Llyn_, ‘the\r\nchurch above the lake.’” In early times, he said, the word “Llan” was\r\nnot only applied to churches, but it also signified the spot surrounding\r\nthe church. The existence to these days of so many Llans bearing the\r\nnames of Welsh saints, such as Llandudno, Llandewi, Llandaff, and\r\nLlandrinio, showed the independence of the early British Church of the\r\nChurch of Rome, and that she had a noble army of saints and martyrs to\r\nboast of long before Augustine came over from Rome, A.D. 596, to preach\r\nthe Gospel to the pagan Saxon. The parish of Llannwchllyn was one of\r\nmuch archæological interest, not the least point in which was that the\r\nhistorical River Dee rose in it under the hill called Duallt, and not at\r\nPantgwn, as was sometimes supposed. Llannwchllyn Church was dedicated to\r\nSt. Duniol, and besides the cathedral of Bangor and the parish church of\r\nHawarden, is the only church in North Wales that bears the name of the\r\nfirst Bishop of Bangor. The old church was taken down in 1872, and was\r\n“restored” at a cost of about £17,000. Plas Rhiwaedog, an old restored\r\npalace of Owen Tudor, the head of the six tribes of North Wales, was\r\nvisited on the way back to Bala. It is now the property of Mr. Price of\r\nRhiwlas, who has retained in it the old oak furniture and some of the\r\noak mantelpieces, on one of which is the date 1699. On the porch is an\r\ninscription, with the date 1664. At the evening meeting, held in the\r\nCounty-hall, Bala, the Rev. Canon Thomas gave a _résumé_ of the\r\ninvestigations of the day, and read a paper descriptive of\r\nMerionethshire 600 years ago. Mr. R. Pryce Jones (Ruthin) read portions\r\nof a paper giving a history of Rhiwaedog, the palace of Owen Tudor as it\r\nhas been called, in which he traced the pedigree of the resident family\r\nfrom 60 B.C., when the head was called Beli Mawr, King of the Britons,\r\nand from whom Billingsgate was named, according to Geoffrey of Monmouth,\r\ndown to Colonel Edward Evans-Lloyd of Moel-y-Garhedd, the present\r\ndescendant of the family.--Wednesday’s excursion was through the Vale of\r\nLlangollen, where the party inspected another Roman mound, Tommen-y-Mur,\r\nnear Maentwrog-road, and then other objects between Maentwrog-road\r\nRailway-station and Dolgelly, the route between these two places being\r\nby road. The church at Llanelltyd, with its inscribed stone, Cymmer\r\nAbbey, and Dolgelly Church were also visited.--The excursion on Thursday\r\nwas eastward among the Berwyn mountains, and the antiquities in the\r\ndistrict around Llangollen were also examined. After visiting\r\nLlantysilio Church, the travellers reached Valle Crucis Abbey. The stone\r\nfragments have been carefully collected and placed as nearly in their\r\noriginal positions as practicable on the carefully-shaven turf which now\r\ntakes the place of the paved floor of the abbey. In the restoration of\r\nthe chapter-house a curious plan was adopted for preserving a memorial\r\nwhich is believed to have no proper connection with the abbey itself.\r\nThis a monumental slab on which the vine, Maltese cross, &c., are\r\ncarved, which is built into the south wall over the central one of three\r\nrecesses, and bears the following inscription: HIC IACET TARVRVET. The\r\nrest of the inscription appears to have been broken off with a portion\r\nof the stone in order to make it fit into the recess. This stone had\r\nbeen used as a mantelpiece in a neighbouring house, but why it was\r\nremoved to its present position is unexplained. As to the foundation of\r\nthe abbey, doubt is still entertained among archæologists. Dugdale, on\r\nthe authority of Leland, ascribes it to Madoc ap Griffith Maylor, Prince\r\nof Powys, assumably about 1200. Looking from the west front towards the\r\nnorth is to be seen, a few hundred yards away in a clump of trees on a\r\nslight mound, a broken pillar, which has been the source of much\r\ncontroversy. This is Elisey’s pillar, and is evidently of the remotest\r\nantiquity, though bearing at present a modern inscription. The wear and\r\ntear of many centuries has almost obliterated the original inscription,\r\nbut traces of letters are still to be detected. There is evidence that\r\nthe cross was certainly in existence before the foundation of the\r\nabbey, which is spoken of as being “near the cross.” Castell Dinas Bran,\r\nwhich is locally known as “Crow Castle,” was next visited. It stands on\r\nthe summit of a conical hill 600 ft. high, and its broken walls and\r\njagged turrets, as seen from below, form a striking feature in the\r\nlandscape. It must have been impregnable against any attack when\r\nfortified in the days of rude warfare. Its early history is somewhat\r\nobscure. It was in 1200 the residence of Madoc ap Griffith, the founder\r\nof Valle Crucis, from which it is distant only two or three miles.\r\nMadoc, it appears, became a traitor to his king, and when he afterwards\r\ngave in his submission it was readily accepted, for the probable reason\r\nthat the Sovereign was aware of the impregnability of his castle, to\r\nwhich he had retired. Llangollen Church has recently been\r\n“restored.”--The excursion on Friday was in the direction of Corwen.\r\nCommencing at Llangar Church, a short drive from Bala, an inscribed\r\nstone in the town was noticed. It bore the inscription Cavoseniagii, but\r\nits interpretation is a matter of controversy. Next came\r\nTomen-y-Castell, another of those mounds common in the district; in this\r\ncase it appears to have been placed as a means of defence and\r\nobservation on an important part of the Roman road leading from Caergai\r\ntowards Deva (Chester). Caer Creini was next visited--a fine\r\nstone-breasted outwork. At Rhug Chapel attention was called to some good\r\ncarving in the roof. Caer Drewyn is a large fort with stone ramparts.\r\nCorwen Church was then reached. This is another restored church, but\r\nhere a fine effigy of a former priest is untouched. Llangan Church, also\r\nrestored, has a good screen and a portion of a pastoral staff, ascribed\r\nto the founder, Dorfel Gadarn. Caerbont was next visited. This is\r\nmentioned by Mr. Hartshorne as belonging to the type of forts of the dry\r\nstone-walling period. In the evening the concluding meeting was held at\r\nthe County-hall, Bala, when the Rev. Canon Thomas read a paper on the\r\n“Ecclesiastical History of Merionethshire.”--A small local museum of\r\nantiquities was formed during the week at the Calvinistic Methodists’\r\nCollege, Bala. It contained some numismatic specimens and a few rare\r\nbooks, among them poems of Phillipe and Catherine ap Howell. A curious\r\nalmsbox was shown, so contrived that an arrangement of teeth prevents\r\nthe abstraction of coins placed therein. Some painted iron crosses, said\r\nto be from Cymmer Abbey, were also shown, the date said to be Henry\r\nVIII., but bearing the appearance of more modern origin.\r\n\r\nSOMERSET ARCHÆOLOGICAL SOCIETY.--The annual meeting of this society took\r\nplace on August 26 and two following days, in the neighbourhood of\r\nShepton Mallet, Lord Carlingford, as president-elect, the Bishop of Bath\r\nand Wells, and Mr. E. A. Freeman taking part in the proceedings. Lord\r\nCarlingford, in his inaugural address, said it was most interesting to\r\nwork their way through ages to the time when the oolite of Doulting was\r\nconverted into the Abbey of Glastonbury and the Cathedral of Wells, and\r\nalso into those humbler and charming sacred edifices which stood around\r\nthem. He greatly sympathised with an eminent architect who at a meeting\r\nof the Archæological Institute last year said in regard to church\r\nrestoration that the good which had been done had been mixed up with an\r\namount of evil and destruction. The effort to bring about restoration to\r\nsome architectural style or pattern selected by the restorer had led to\r\nmuch useless and mischievous change and destruction. The true word was\r\nnot restoration, but preservation, and that idea ought to be present to\r\nthe mind of everyone dealing with an ancient building. As a preventive\r\nthere should be created and fostered an historic sense, an historic\r\nfeeling in these matters. He knew no other safeguard, except that of\r\nthe sense of respect and reverence and tenderness for the work of their\r\nforefathers--the desire that not only the years of their own lives, but\r\nthe generations of men should be bound each to each by natural ties. The\r\nmembers afterwards examined the parish church of Shepton Mallet, and\r\nthen proceeded to Doulting, where they inspected the quarries, the old\r\ntithe-barn and church, and St. Aldhelm’s Well, and on the return journey\r\nmade a halt at Beacon Hill, where a mound on the summit, crowned by a\r\nrough upright stone, was the object of considerable curiosity. The Rev.\r\nH. M. Scarth said that such mounds were frequently found near Roman\r\nroads. At the evening meeting the following papers were read: “The Malet\r\nFamily,” by Mr. Arthur Malet; “The Prebendary of Dinder,” by Canon\r\nChurch; and “Extracts from Wills Relating to the County of Somerset,” by\r\nMr. A. J. Monday.--On the second day an excursion was made to\r\nLeigh-on-Mendip, Mells, and Kilsmersdon, the churches and other objects\r\nof interest at each place being duly examined and commented upon. In the\r\nevening Mr. Scarth read a paper on “Roman Cookery;” among the other\r\npapers read were: “The Romans in Bath,” “Ham Hill,” and “The Penn\r\nPits.”--The concluding day was devoted to Radstock. Mr. E. Green, the\r\nhon. secretary, read some notes which had been prepared by Mr.\r\nMcMurtrie, on the Roman road through Somerset, which in its course from\r\nBath to Ilchester passed through the parish of Radstock. The church,\r\nwith its Norman font and early porch, was afterwards visited; the party\r\nalso inspected the Fosse-road, here seen exactly as used and left by the\r\nRomans, a section having been cut through, and the surface cleared.--A\r\nmuseum of local antiquities, lent for the occasion, and arranged by Mr.\r\nW. Bidgood, the honorary secretary of the society, was open during the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nWILTSHIRE ARCHÆOLOGICAL AND NATURAL HISTORY SOCIETY.--The members of the\r\nabove Society held their annual meeting at Shaftesbury on August 6, 7,\r\nand 8. At the afternoon meeting on the 6th, the President, Mr. Nevil\r\nStory-Maskelyne, M.P., presented to the Hon. Secretary, Rev. A. C.\r\nSmith, an album, enclosed in a case of woods from Syria and Egypt, in\r\nrecognition of his long-continued services to the Society; and\r\nespecially in the matter of his recent great work, “An Archæological Map\r\nof the Hundred Square Miles around Abury.” Some historical notes on the\r\nRiver Thames were followed by a paper on “Shaftesbury, or Shaston,”\r\nwritten some years ago by a former rector, and now read by Rev. J. B.\r\nWilkinson. The foundation of the fortified abbey by Alfred; the final\r\nburial in state of Edward the Martyr; the death of Cnut; the\r\nimprisonment of Elizabeth, wife of Robert Bruce, here were mentioned, as\r\nalso the ancient custom of the Mayor annually visiting the wells below\r\nthe town with a decked broom, a calf’s head, loaves, &c. After the\r\nannual dinner, a conversazione was held in the Town-hall. Canon Jackson,\r\nF.S.A., read a paper on “Cranbourne Chace.” Its boundaries extended from\r\nShaftesbury to Salisbury, and to Ringwood, the forest being divided into\r\ncertain “walks.” The history of the Chace, and the various law-suits\r\noccurring from the time of John to its disestablishment, were mentioned,\r\nand the habits of the deer-stealers, both of high and low birth,\r\ndescribed minutely and illustrated by contemporary accounts, sketches,\r\nweapons, &c., from Rushmore. On Thursday the Society visited the\r\ncircular encampment called Castle Rings, on the edge of the high land,\r\noverlooking the vale of Wardour, and close by a half-excavated barrow,\r\nof large size, was inspected. Tisbury Church was next visited. Here the\r\ncurious low western porch, the fine roof of the nave, and the later\r\n(restored) roofs of the aisles, the marks of the originally very low\r\nroof of the south aisle, and the one remaining window, and the east\r\nwindow, with inserted tracery, attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, were\r\nall carefully inspected. At the rectory were exhibited several objects\r\nof interest, notably one of the few folios of Shakespeare of 1625, and a\r\nlarge and beautiful cup of silver gilt, given to Lord Boteler by\r\nElizabeth, for his kindness to her in her retirement. The beautiful site\r\nof (the so-called) Fonthill Abbey--that ephemeral erection of the last\r\ncentury, and the splendid collection of enamels, &c., in the mansion of\r\nMr. A. Morrison, were enjoyed on the way to East Knoyle, where Mr. A.\r\nSeymour had provided luncheon for the party, and Mrs. Seymour had laid\r\nout many pieces of rare and valuable embroideries. At Pytt House, Mr. V.\r\nF. Benett-Stanford exhibited several autograph letters from Charles I.\r\nto his “Dear Nephew” (Rupert), found amongst papers in the lumber room,\r\nprobably preserved by Prince Rupert’s secretary. The party then passed\r\non to Hatch House, which has been lately repaired. Wardour Castle was\r\nthrown open by Lord Arundel, who in person conducted his guests round\r\nthe rooms, pointing out such objects of interest as the peculiar “Hagar\r\nand Ishmael,” by Barteli; the “Tobit,” by Gerhard Douw; and the two\r\nfull-length Reynolds’; the portrait of the lady who defended the castle\r\nagainst the Parliamentary army; the so-called Glastonbury cup--a\r\nwooden-covered flagon, carved with the twelve apostles under round\r\narches, probably no older than the Renaissance. A hasty inspection of\r\nthe fine ruin of the original castle brought this expedition to a close.\r\nIn the evening “Local Geology” was expounded by the Rev. T. Perkins, who\r\nalso threw open his observatory; and a paper on “Gnostic Amulets” was\r\nread by Rev. W. F. Short, who exhibited a considerable variety of\r\nantique seals, gems, &c. The last expedition of the Society took them to\r\nTollard-Royal Church. Here the ownership of arms upon the shield of a\r\nknight was the subject of much controversy. General Pitt-Rivers led the\r\nway to the Larmer Tree, a spot of much historic importance as the “mere”\r\nof three parishes and two counties, and a place of assembly from\r\nprehistoric times down to the disafforesting of Cranbourne Chace. The\r\nmuseum at Farnham, made by General Pitt-Rivers for the instruction of\r\nhis agricultural neighbours, is a model of what such collections should\r\nbe in clearness of arrangement and labelling. The General met the party\r\nat a group of barrows in Handley Wood, and explained his excavations\r\nthere; he then entertained the Society at Rushmore Lodge; gave an\r\ninteresting and well-illustrated lecture on the various excavations of\r\nbarrows, pits, and camps, which he has carried out; and, finally,\r\npointed out the remarkable features of the great Winklebury Camp, with\r\nthe square pit-dwelling and the neighbouring Saxon Cemetery that he had\r\ndiscovered and excavated. With this the meeting closed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: text decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\nMR.

An oblong underground chamber--not a tomb--has recently been\r\ndiscovered. It has sides of stone and lime, a floor of stone flags, and\r\na roof formed of the floor of the cathedral itself. This chamber\r\nmeasures 6 ft. 3 in. in length, by 4 ft. in width, and has a depth of 6\r\nft. A curved range of steps of about two yards in extent, and hitherto\r\nquite concealed, leads down to an entrance on the flank side of the\r\ncavity. The chamber was filled with lumber of all descriptions,\r\nincluding fragments of the famous choir screen which fell a prey to\r\nCromwell’s zealots, scraps of leathern work, iron, steel, half charred\r\nwood, and a quantity of bones. Its original use is uncertain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAntiquarian Correspondence.\r\n\r\n                    Sin scire labores,\r\n    Quære, age: quærenti pagina nostra patet.\r\n\r\n_All communications must be accompanied by the name and address of the\r\nsender, not necessarily for publication._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JOHNSON CENTENARY.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I desire to place before the public generally, and my\r\nfellow-citizens in particular, the question of the forthcoming Centenary\r\nof the death of Dr. Johnson. I feel that I am not called upon to enter\r\ninto the details of the life of the great lexicographer, nor need I\r\nrefer to the influence he exercised in so many and various ways over the\r\nliterature of his country. The question with which I, as Mayor, have to\r\ndeal is--Whether the Centenary of his death, which happens in December\r\nnext, shall be observed; and, if so, what shall be the character of such\r\ndemonstration? From time to time various schemes have been advocated,\r\nbut it seems to me that, after the numerous appeals for funds lately\r\nmade in every direction, it is not advisable to undertake any\r\nresponsibility calculated to entail a large financial risk. At the same\r\ntime, without in any way attempting to indicate the direction of such a\r\ncelebration, and, indeed, without expressing a personal opinion in the\r\nmatter, I deem it a duty to thus publicly invite expressions of opinion.\r\nWe have somewhat over two months before us--sufficient time, I think, if\r\ndesired, to arrange a moderate programme. I therefore invite all who\r\nfeel interested to communicate by letter with me on the following\r\npoints:--\r\n\r\n1. Is it desirable to observe the Centenary of Dr. Johnson’s death?\r\n\r\n2. If so, what form shall such observance take?\r\n\r\n3. If arrangements are made for some observance of it, in what way are\r\nthey likely or willing to aid it?\r\n\r\nI must ask that all replies and offers of assistance shall be sent to me\r\nas early as possible, marked outside “Dr. Johnson’s Centenary.” If they\r\nare of such a nature as to indicate the prospect of a thoroughly\r\nsuccessful observance, I will at once convene a meeting of those\r\nfavourable to the project, and do what I can, privately and officially,\r\nto secure its success. If, on the other hand, the replies indicate a\r\nreasonable doubt as to the success or desirability of the undertaking, I\r\nshall (after consultation with others interested in the matter) feel\r\nmyself at liberty to abandon the proposed movement. I therefore wish it\r\nto be understood that the celebration, if any, will be set on foot at\r\nthe desire of those who by replying to this communication express\r\nthemselves in favour of it. I think this is the better way to deal with\r\nthe subject; at all events it will relieve me, as Mayor, of personal\r\nresponsibility should the attempt to secure some notice of the death of\r\nour chief citizen fail for want of the requisite enthusiasm. I would\r\npress on everyone really interested to give me the assistance of their\r\nopinion and advice by the date indicated.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, your obedient servant,\r\nTHOMAS H. HUNT, Mayor of Lichfield.\r\n\r\n_Lichfield Close, September 17._\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTS AND CHESTERS.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your readers may have observed, and with some amusement, that the\r\nsimultaneous assault on my position by Dr. Pring and Mr. Hall, in your\r\nlast issue, has ended in the somewhat untoward result of their\r\ndiscovering that they are themselves hopelessly at issue on the\r\nfundamental point of all! Dr. Pring persists that the “port” in\r\n“port-reeve” is derived from the Latin _porta_, a city gate (p. 114):\r\nMr. Hall asserts with equal confidence that it comes “by transition from\r\nthe Latin _portus_,” a haven (p. 149). Dr. Pring appeals to “the learned\r\nProfessor Stubbs” (p. 114), but “seems” (to adopt his own expression)\r\n“to have found it convenient to ignore” that I have shown Dr. Stubbs’\r\nrendering of the passage from the Laws of Athelstan to be simply\r\ndestructive of his own. I repeat, that when Dr. Pring renders it\r\n“outside the port _or gate_” (p. 115), the words “or gate” _are_, and\r\nshould be distinguished as, a mere gloss of his own, and must not,\r\ntherefore, be appealed to by him as evidence. My own quotation: “Newport\r\nGate,” in Lincoln (p. 115), is no gloss of my own at all, but a\r\n_verbatim_ copy. Dr. Pring must indeed be hard up if he falls back on\r\nthe Latinisation of East Gate as _portam de East Gatâ_ (temp. Henry I.),\r\nsince by the mediæval scribe, as by the modern schoolboy, a gate would\r\nbe rightly styled in Latin a _porta_ (“East gate” being suffixed as a\r\nproper name for the sake of distinction). What conceivable bearing has\r\nthis on the use of the term “port” (for a market town) in Anglo-Saxon\r\ntimes? Yet such is the disingenuous argument of my critic, who proclaims\r\nthat I “must surely have overlooked these and similar instances”! And if\r\nhe had done me the honour to read my paper with common care, he would\r\nhave seen that I carefully distinguish the “port” of proper names, such\r\nas “Newport Gate,” from the “port” in “port-reeve.” This destroys his\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Pring appealed to Dr. Stubbs, as laying down that “port” was\r\nderived from “porta,” _because the gate was the place where the markets\r\nwere held_, I proved by demonstration that the markets were _not_ held\r\nat the gate, but in the heart of the town, and that consequently the\r\nargument breaks down. What does Dr. Pring do? He ridicules this disproof\r\nof the very argument he had appealed to as “scarcely necessary” (p.\r\n116), and as based on “a well-known fact”! Verily, we have here, to\r\nquote his own words, a “unique and somewhat anomalous specimen of\r\nargument.”\r\n\r\nDr. Pring’s arguments could similarly be rebutted at every point, but\r\nlest I weary the patience of your readers, it will probably be\r\nsufficient if I invite them to observe that on the one hand, Dr. Pring,\r\nderiving “port” from _porta_, declares the process by which a _town_\r\ncame to be called a _gate_, so “easy and obvious” (p. 114), that he need\r\nnot (_i.e._, cannot) explain it; while, on the other, Mr. Hall, deriving\r\nport from _portus_, is equally confident that an inland town would, in\r\nthe natural course of things, be known as a sea-port (_portus_)! When\r\nDr. Pring has converted Mr. Hall, or Mr. Hall has converted Dr. Pring,\r\nit will then, and not before, be time for them to think of uniting their\r\nforces in a combined attack on my own theory, which sees in the\r\nAnglo-Saxon “port,” as found in “port-reeve,” &c., a word with a\r\ndenotation different from that either of _portus_ or of _porta_. At\r\npresent it remains, unimpugned, as the only rational and consistent\r\ntheory. It will, doubtless, like all original theories, be viewed at\r\nfirst with suspicion and dislike, but I hope, in time, to have it cast\r\nat me, _more Pringensi_, by those who do so, that it is “scarcely\r\nnecessary” to prove it, as it is to all “a well-known fact.”\r\n\r\nJ.

A. WARD.\r\n\r\n_PART IV._\r\n\r\n(_Continued from p. 60._)\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the preface, addressed to his son Cæsar, he shows himself perfectly\r\nalive to the poor reception his book is likely to meet with from many;\r\nhe says: “Qu’elle fera retirer le front en arrière à plus d’un qui la\r\nlira, sans y rien comprendre.” He does not write for babes and the\r\nilliterate, and has no sympathy with the words in Mark x. 14: “Sinite\r\nparvulos venire ad me.” On the contrary, he cites from Matthew vii. 6\r\nwith approval the antithetical sentence uttered by the Saviour: “‘Nolite\r\nsanctum dare canibus, ne conculcent pedibus et conversi disrumpant vos:’\r\nwhich hath been the cause that I have withdrawn my tongue from the\r\nvulgar, and my pen from paper.”\r\n\r\n“But,” he runs on, “afterwards I was writing for the common good, to\r\nenlarge myself in dark and abstruse sentences, declaring the future\r\nevents, chiefly the most urgent, and those which I foresaw (whatever\r\nhuman mutation happened) _would not offend the hearers_.”[52]\r\n\r\nHere the words marked in italics give us the limitation he set to his\r\nown office and position. His function is purely that of a _seer_; he\r\nforesees, and sometimes for the “common good” he records his\r\nexperiences,[53] but he does not take upon himself the mission of the\r\nBaptist to “prepare a way” for great events, nor like Jeremiah to raise\r\na cry of national lamentation, nor like Isaiah will he denounce evil nor\r\nevil-doers.\r\n\r\nHis idea of prophecy is nothing but the passivity of foresight. He\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n     “The prophets, by means only of the immortal God and good angels,\r\n     have received the spirit of vaticination, by which they foresee\r\n     things and foretell future events; for nothing is perfect without\r\n     Him, whose power and goodness is so great to His creatures, that\r\n     though they are but men, nevertheless, by the likeness of our good\r\n     genius to the angels,[54] this heat and the prophetical power draws\r\n     near us, as it happens by the beams of the sun, which cast their\r\n     influence both on elementary and not elementary bodies; as for us\r\n     who are men, we cannot attain anything by our natural knowledge of\r\n     the secrets of God our Creator. ‘Quia non est nostrum nosse tempora\r\n     nec momenta,’ &c. (Acts i. 7.)”\r\n\r\nIt should be noticed by every candid critic that there is strong\r\ninternal evidence in this passage of genuine truthfulness in the writer.\r\nFirst he defines his own position to be merely that of a _seer_. He then\r\ngives his idea of a prophet, and describes him as one who has received a\r\nspirit of vaticination by foresight. He then says that this prophetical\r\nheat is unattainable by any natural knowledge of man, but comes like\r\nthat of the sun, direct from the Giver of all good gifts to man. This is\r\nvery much as Samuel How, the inspired cobbler, Bunyan, or any old\r\nPuritan in the seventeenth century would have described it: “The\r\nsufficiency of the Spirit’s teaching without human learning.” But in\r\naddition to this perfect simplicity of spirit, he ventures to quote the\r\nSaviour’s words: “It is not for you to know the times or the seasons,”\r\nwhich, with Matthew xxiv. 36, is the strongest passage in the New\r\nTestament against a gift of prophecy in man. Would a man who had any\r\ndoubt at all about his possession of the faculty of prevision cite a\r\npassage which seemed to withhold the prophetic gift from all mankind\r\nunder the new covenant of the Christian dispensation?\r\n\r\nGrotius and Heinsius show that these words χρόνους ἧ καιροὺς should be\r\nunderstood of the _time, times, and an half_, of Daniel (xii. 7), when\r\nChrist, of the stem of Jesse, should begin under Constantine to direct\r\nthe executive government of kings on earth as King of kings, which took\r\nplace 300 years later. If this were to be hidden from Apostles, how\r\nshould a layman, and idiot (so to speak), look for inspiration? To me\r\nthis consideration entirely and finally disposes of any doubt as to\r\nimposition intentional. Be Nostradamus prophet and seer, or not, it is\r\nnext to impossible for anyone of fair and impartial mind hereafter to\r\nhold that he was an impostor. To suppose it even, is _impossible_ to a\r\nrational judge, if we grant that we are, in a degree ever so little,\r\ncapable by nature of estimating the motives of a fellow-creature.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the preface he says:--\r\n\r\n     “Not that I will attribute to myself the name of a prophet, but as\r\n     a mortal man, being no farther from heaven by my sense than I am\r\n     from earth by my feet, _possum errare, falli, decipi_, I am the\r\n     greatest sinner of the world, subject to all humane afflictions,\r\n     but being surprised sometimes in the week by a prophetical humour,\r\n     and by a long calculation, pleasing myself in my study, I have made\r\n     books of prophecies, &c.”\r\n\r\nHe speaks also of the mode of enlightenment, “by a long melancholy\r\ninspiration revealed,” and says it takes “its original from above, and\r\nsuch light and small flame is of all efficacy and sublimity, no less\r\nthan the natural light makes the philosophers so secure.” All this\r\njustifies fully the distich, so far as motive goes:--\r\n\r\n    “Vera loquor, non falsa loquor sed munere cœli,\r\n      Qui loquitur Deus est, non ego Nostradamus.”\r\n\r\nHe opens the first “Century” with an announcement (by some called an\r\nincantation) of the methods by which he prepared himself for the\r\nreception of the knowledge of future things:\r\n\r\n    “Estant assis, de nuit secrette estude,\r\n     Seul, reposé sur la selle d’airain,\r\n     Flambe exigue, sortant de solitude,\r\n     Fait proferer qui n’est a croire vain.”\r\n\r\n     “Sitting by night, in secret study alone, resting on a brazen seat,\r\n     a slight flame arising out of the solitude makes me utter things\r\n     not vain to be believed.”\r\n\r\n    “La verge en main, mise au milieu des Branches,\r\n     De l’onde je mouille et le Limb et le Pied,\r\n     En peur j’escris fremissant par les manches;\r\n     Splendeur Divine: le Divine prez s’assied.”\r\n\r\n     “With wand in hand placed amidst the branches, I wet with water the\r\n     limb and foot, and write in fear, trembling in my sleeves;\r\n     “Splendour divine! the Divinity sits at hand.’”\r\n\r\nA tranquillised mind is requisite to prophecy. We find Elisha (2 Kings\r\niii. 15) requiring a minstrel to play, that the hand of the Lord may\r\ncome upon him. External objects disturb the senses, so that night is\r\nbest for contemplation, as Malebranche is said to have shut himself up\r\nin a dark room to study and think out his “Recherche de la Vérité.”\r\nSolitude is essential to prophecy. A man cannot commune with heaven in\r\nthe busy haunts of men. Nature is the presence-chamber of the Deity.\r\nEvery man of sensibility knows this; and the prophet most of all men\r\nfeels the pith and central depth of Pope’s fine line, and that he must\r\nreach prophecy “Looking through Nature up to Nature’s God.” Society\r\ndemands that you sacrifice your convictions constantly to good manners.\r\nSocial convention contaminates noble originality and high principle.\r\nTruth never dwells in the court of kings, and the drawing-rooms of the\r\nwell-to-do are no fitter for its shrine, for the men and women there are\r\nroyalties divested of respect and state-trappings; they are\r\nover-pampered humanities for the most part: to be much in their company\r\nyou must compromise the divinest part of you--your convictions--and it\r\nis by pursuing conviction that the soul flies heavenward. One might\r\nwrite an essay on the Brazen Stool with its proverb _ex tripode loqui_,\r\nbut anyhow these opening verses convey to the mind with wonderful\r\nbrevity a vivid picture of a mediæval magician at his work.\r\n\r\nGarencières allegorises here so widely as to show what havoc ingenuity\r\ncan play with _analogy_, which is a key to the occult things of the\r\nuniverse in good hands--those of the prophet, poet, or genius of any\r\nsort. The rod, he says, is the _pen_, placed in the middle of the\r\nbranches means the _fingers_ of the hand, the water he dips it in is the\r\n_ink_ he writes with, wetting limb and foot is the _paper_ covered from\r\ntop to bottom. Was manuscript ever, since the world began, more\r\nmystically shadowed forth?\r\n\r\nThe interest of English readers will perhaps be most readily drawn to\r\nNostradamus, by dealing first with some of the most remarkable\r\nprophecies concerning England; and with the invaluable aid of M. Anatole\r\nle Pelletier’s admirable work on Nostradamus, this can at any rate for a\r\nfew of the quatrains be most readily accomplished. He gives six examples\r\nfrom the various “Centuries.” The first relates to the supremacy of\r\nEngland at sea: “L’Angleterre le Panpotent des mers.” The word Panpotent\r\nis a barbarous Græco-Latin word for πᾶν-potens, all-powerful.\r\nThe periods M. le Pelletier would assign to these changes or revolutions\r\nin England extend from 1501, the birth of Lutheranism, to 1791, the\r\ncommencement of the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nHe selects Century iii., quatrain 57:--\r\n\r\n    “Sept fois changer verrez gent Britanique,\r\n     Teints en sang en deux cens nonante an;\r\n     Franche non point, par appuy Germanique;\r\n     Aries doubte son pole Bastarnan.”\r\n\r\n     “You shall see the British nation, inundated with blood, change\r\n     seven times in 290 years. But France not so, thanks to the firmness\r\n     of her Germanic kings. The sign of the Ram shall no longer\r\n     recognise the north of Europe (son pole Bastarnan) it will so have\r\n     changed.”[55]\r\n\r\nHere we have to notice that 1501 plus 290 equals 1791, which may if you\r\nlike be taken as the date of the commencement of the French Revolution,\r\nthough commonly it is reckoned from 1789, the taking of the Bastille.\r\nThe Germanic kings are the descendants of Hugh Capet. Bastarnia stands\r\nfor Poland as its ancient name. The first dismemberment of Poland took\r\nplace in 1772. Then Russia grew into power, Peter ascended the throne\r\n1682, and Lutheranism triumphed in Germany. Such changes might well\r\nstartle the Ram from all recognition of the northern world.\r\n\r\n1501 is the date of the Renaissance, and from that to 1792 England is to\r\nundergo seven revolutions.\r\n\r\n1. In England Henry VIII. breaks free from Rome, and the Church of\r\nEngland is set up in 1532.\r\n\r\n2. 1553 Mary restores the Papal religion.\r\n\r\n3. 1558 Elizabeth re-establishes Anglican independence.\r\n\r\n4. In 1649 Charles I. is beheaded, and the Republic established under\r\nCromwell’s Protectorate.\r\n\r\n5. In 1660 Charles II. is restored.\r\n\r\n6. In 1689 James II. abdicating, is displaced by William III., his\r\nson-in-law.\r\n\r\n7. In 1714 George I., of the House of Hanover, is called to the throne.\r\n\r\nThe brevity with which all this is inferred is as remarkable as the\r\ncurious precision with which it was fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe accession of James I. to the death of Charles I. (1603-1649) is set\r\nforth in\r\n\r\nCENTURY X. QUATRAIN 40.\r\n\r\n    “Le jeune nay au regne Britannique,\r\n     Qu’ aura ce père mourant recommandé,\r\n     Iceluy mort, _Lonole_[56] donra topique,[57]\r\n     Et à son fils le regne demandé.”[58]\r\n\r\n     “The young prince[59] of the kingdom of Britain (then first called\r\n     Great Britain) is born, whose father (Henry Darnley, assassinated\r\n     by Bothwell) in dying commended him to the protection of the\r\n     principal Scottish nobility. When this prince (James I. of England,\r\n     and VI. of Scotland) is dead, _Lonole_ by the employment of\r\n     Puritanical eloquence (or canting rhetoric) will despoil his son\r\n     (Charles I.) of his kingdom.”\r\n\r\nLe Pelletier thinks it is quite clear that _Lonole_ Ολλὑων\r\nstands for Cromwell, but a further coincidence arises, namely, that\r\n_Lonole_ is an all but correct anagram of _Ole Nol_ or _Old Noll_, the\r\nProtector’s nickname. Garencières prints _Londre_ for _Lonole_, and so\r\nrenders what at best is obscure entirely unintelligible, and fancies\r\nthat he clearly discerns it to be a prophecy concerning Charles II.,\r\nbecause he was commended to the care of his subjects by Charles I. on\r\nthe scaffold.\r\n\r\n    CENTURY III. QUATRAIN 80 (in some Eds. 82).\r\n\r\n       “Du regne Anglois le digne dechassé[60]\r\n        Le conseiller par ire[61] mis à feu,\r\n        Ses adherents iront si bas tracer,[62]\r\n        Que le bastard sera demy receu.”\r\n\r\n     “He who had a right to the kingdom of England is displaced, is _mis\r\n     à feu_, sacrificed to the heat of popular fury. His adherents\r\n     descend to such a depth of baseness that the bastard (or usurper)\r\n     will be half received by the kingdom.”\r\n\r\nThat is to say, Charles I. will be deprived of power after having\r\nyielded up Strafford to the popular fury, in the hope of escaping\r\nhimself. The Scotch (old adherents) will be so base as to sell him for\r\ntwo millions to the Cromwellites, who put him to death, and Cromwell\r\nbecoming Protector, and not quite king, therefore will obtain an almost\r\nroyal bastard, _i.e._, a half reception (à demy receu).\r\n\r\n    CENTURY IX. QUATRAIN 49.\r\n\r\n       “Gand et Bruceles marcheront contre[63] Anvers,\r\n        Senat de Londres mettront à mort leur Roy:\r\n        Le sel et vin luy seront à l’envers,\r\n        Pour eux avoir le regne en desarroy.”\r\n\r\n     “When Ghent and Brussels march over against Antwerp,[64] the Senate\r\n     of London, or the Long Parliament, will put their king to death.\r\n     Force and wisdom (vin et sel[65]) will be wanting to Charles’s\r\n     councils (lui seront à l’envers), and they (the Independents) will\r\n     in the general disorder become masters of the kingdom.”\r\n\r\n    CENTURY VIII. QUATRAIN 76.\r\n\r\n       “Plus Macelin[66] que Roi en Angleterre,\r\n        Lieu obscur nay par force aura l’Empire,\r\n        Lasche, sans foy, sans loy, saignera terre;\r\n        Son tems s’approche si près qui je souspire.”\r\n\r\n     “More butcher than king in England, a man of obscure birth [_né_ en\r\n     lieu obscur] by force shall obtain the Empire. Unprincipled,\r\n     restrained by neither faith nor law, he will drench the earth with\r\n     blood. His time approaches so near as to make me heave a sigh.”\r\n\r\nThis is an announcement of such unparalleled and terrific import that\r\nNostradamus exhibits more feeling over it than he does usually over his\r\nprognostications. The butcher-like face of Cromwell, with its fleshy\r\nconch and hideous warts, seems to have been visually present to him, and\r\nto have struck him with such a sense of terror and vividness that he\r\nimagines the time must be very near at hand. Though a full century had\r\nto elapse, he sighs with a present shudder, and the blood creeps. One of\r\nthe remarkable features throughout the work of Nostradamus is the\r\ngeneral absence of any sense of time apart from the mere enumeration of\r\nyears as an algebraic or arithmetical sign; on this momentous occasion\r\nhe departs from his usual practice, and stands horror-stricken as in a\r\nfearful vision.\r\n\r\n    CENTURY X. QUATRAIN 100.\r\n\r\n       “Le grand Empire sera par Angleterre\r\n        Le Pempotan des ans plus de trois cens:\r\n        Grandes copies passer par mer et terre,\r\n        Les Lusitains n’en serons par contens.”\r\n\r\n     “The great empire of England shall be all-powerful ( πᾶν-potens)\r\n     for more than 300 years.[67] Then great armies shall come by sea\r\n     and land, and the Portuguese shall not be satisfied therewith.”\r\n\r\nThis seems to foreshadow that the naval power of England will be\r\nsuppressed by sea-borne armies overwhelming her on her own shores, and\r\nthe Lusitanians, or Portuguese, the oldest allies of England, will not\r\nbe content, because, probably, Portugal at the same instant will be\r\noverwhelmed by Spain simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThis is as far as we can go in English history under the guidance of Le\r\nPelletier. But, nevertheless, I shall adduce several more quatrains,\r\nbringing the sequence down at least to the establishment of the House of\r\nHanover on the English throne in the person of George I.\r\n\r\n(_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: text decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDown a Yorkshire River.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PART I._\r\n\r\nHad any one been able to sail down the River Calder, say a hundred years\r\nago, long before the present little manufacturing towns had arisen on\r\nits banks, he would have passed through some of the most lovely scenery\r\nand through one of the loveliest mountain valleys in the county of York.\r\nEven to-day, when ugly mills and numberless prosaic tenements of trade\r\ndisfigure, from an artistic point of view, the once grassy glades and\r\nthe once gloriously wooded slopes, the prospect in many spots retains\r\nmuch of its virginal sweetness and romantic beauty. There are yet long\r\ntracts which commerce has not irremediably mutilated--pleasant\r\nmeadowlands as fair with wilding flowers as of old; sylvan haunts of\r\nbirch and elm whose dusky quietude is well-nigh as unbroken and solemn\r\nas of yore; bonnie tributary brooklets flashing and hurrying, like\r\nsilver-footed naiads, through clough and dell and dene. As the eye takes\r\na loftier and farther sweep the rugged contour and massive forms of\r\nforest-clad and moorland-capped mountains may be seen to wear much the\r\nsame aspect they wore in the primal historic days of Roman and Celt. The\r\nconquests of commerce over both material and mental difficulties are\r\napparent almost everywhere on the lowlands, for which all sensible and\r\nright-thinking minds are grateful, plain and anti-poetical as the\r\noutward signs may be in the jumble of viaduct and railway station, of\r\nfactory and shop. But the old world of chivalry and romance is not\r\naltogether pushed aside: there are the ruins of stately and curiously\r\ncarved gateways whence issued squire and yeoman to join the Pilgrimage\r\nof Grace, or later, gallant cavaliers, eager to mingle in the fray on\r\nthe far-away field of Marston Moor; there are a few old Elizabethan\r\nhalls with mullioned window and grey stone porch, in whose cool recesses\r\nthe inmates waited anxiously and breathlessly for tidings about the\r\ngreat Armada; and here and there, built by pious hands that have been\r\nstill for centuries, there are relics of quiet, quaint chapelle, where\r\nrepose the ashes of Crusader knight, and of knights who fought so\r\nfiercely in the bloody wars of the Red and White Rose; and now and then\r\nwe come across a grand antique church, crowded by worshippers where the\r\nritual and the language of the worship have undergone many changes, and\r\naround whose hallowed precincts have gathered historic traditions and\r\nsaintly legends, hoarier and older than the lichens that crust the\r\nmouldering towers. The tall chimneys are rising in the busy centres of\r\ntrade, but occasionally we shelter under an oak or a yew-tree whose\r\nyouth was fanned by less smutty winds; railway whistles have scared the\r\nnightingale, but the lark still carols anear human dwellings; graylings\r\nno longer leap the river-weir, but the waters sing and gleam as they\r\nglide seaward down the hushed moonlit glens.\r\n\r\nThe Calder, one of the most picturesque of northern rivers, rises near\r\nCliviger Dene, in Lancashire, and enters the county of York through a\r\nwild gorge at Todmorden. As to the origin of the word there have been\r\nmany conjectures, some plausible, but none to my mind satisfactory. An\r\nable writer in a provincial publication gives the derivation from two\r\nCeltic words, _coll_, the hazel-tree, and _dur_, water. The fatal\r\nobjection to this is that hazel-trees never grew in such abundance in\r\nthis valley as to be a distinguishing feature. Place-names with the\r\nCeltic _coll_ and the Saxon _hæsel_ are very rarely found. Had copses or\r\nshaws of the hazel flourished to such an extent as to give a name to the\r\nriver, their former existence would still be traceable in the abiding\r\nnomenclature of the country through which the Calder runs its course.\r\nThe Rev. Thomas Wright, who published a work on the antiquities of the\r\nparish of Halifax, where he was curate for more than seventeen years,\r\nnoticing the Calder states that the spring is called _Cal_ or _Col_, and\r\nis joined by the River _Dar_. This is a purely fanciful supposition,\r\nand, I believe, not borne out by facts. Dr. Whitaker urges a Danish\r\nderivation. The Danes unquestionably won and maintained a lasting hold\r\non the hills overlooking the Calder. As soon as this mountain-born\r\nstream assumes the dignity and proportions of a river at Todmorden, it\r\nwashes on the one hand Langfield, the Long Range of hills, and on the\r\nother Stansfield, the Stony Range, whilst a few miles lower down it\r\nflows at the foot of Norland, the North-land--all Danish, or more\r\ncorrectly Scandinavian, terms. Then, on the slopes rising from the south\r\nbanks, we have Sowerby and Fixby, two ancient “by’s,” where families of\r\npredatory Danes took up their abode. Other nomenclature traces of the\r\nsame nation, of the great Canute himself possibly, might be mentioned in\r\nfavour of the argument on this side of the question; though (I write\r\nfrom memory) I believe Dr. Whitaker does not point out the surrounding\r\nDanish indications I have here advanced. Another historian surmised that\r\nthe original Celtic name was _Dur_, and that the Saxons on settling in\r\nthis neighbourhood added the adjective _ceald_ or _cold_. But this is\r\nvery improbable, the river in question being no cooler than any other.\r\n\r\nI venture to urge a derivation different from any of the above, viz.,\r\nfrom the Celtic _caoill_ (wood) and _dur_ (water). That Celts, the\r\nBrigantian clan, lived in this locality is an historic fact, the proofs\r\nof which need not be here adduced. The Calder beck as soon as it issues\r\nfrom the spring in Cliviger Dene flows by a long stretching sweep of\r\nwoodland, and farther on among the hills of Yorkshire, a broader and a\r\nnobler stream, pursues its course for miles through dense primeval\r\nforests, among which may be mentioned the once famous forest of\r\nHardwick. Its precipitous banks were clothed with no mere hazel coppice,\r\nbut with vast masses of the more majestic oak and ash and birch,\r\nwoodland in its wilder and more imposing form. Even to-day, though most\r\nof the primeval forest has been cut down, and manufacturing villages\r\nhave sprung up on the ancient sylvan sites, the tourist starting above\r\nTodmorden would not, in a walk of thirty miles by the river side, be\r\nable to lose sight of the picturesque and far-stretching belts of\r\nwoodland scenery. It is yet emphatically the _Caoill-dur_, the water\r\nwinding through the woods. Of course, in this case the Saxons took up\r\nthe word as they found it in use among the conquered Celts. Then, to\r\nstrengthen this conjecture, the very first tributary brook on the\r\nnorth--of size and importance, at least, to give a name to the\r\nvalley--joining the parent stream is the Colden or Caldene, which\r\nprobably is the _Caoill-dene_, the woodland valley. The reader will\r\njudge how accurately the word describes this lonely mountain glen when\r\nhe is told that at a distance the eye can scarcely catch a flash of the\r\nwaters of this stream as they hurry down this wild sylvan region, so\r\nthickly is it overshadowed by a forest of ash and birch. A topographical\r\nword derived from two languages is rare in this part, and when we come\r\nacross one it is generally a Saxon grafted on the more primitive Celtic\r\nname of mountain or river. Colden or Caldene is probably an instance to\r\nthe point.\r\n\r\nThat _caoill_ was contracted to, or commonly pronounced, _cal_ may be\r\npretty safely supposed, when we know that in the Latinised form or\r\ntransformation it became _cal_, as in Caledonii, that is,\r\n_Caoill-daoin_, the people inhabiting the woods. The reader will\r\nperceive that _caoill_ is closely akin to the Greek κᾶλον, also\r\nsignifying a wood.\r\n\r\nThe Calder, which is a very sinuous stream, runs a most irregular but\r\ncharmingly diversified course as it winds under scout and scar, now\r\ngliding smoothly past belts of woodland or by long stretches of fair\r\npastoral field, or again in narrower channel foaming more rapidly\r\nthrough wild ravine or over rocky weir, only again to slip into more\r\ntranquil waters, pleasantly gladdening as with quiet familiarity village\r\nand thorpe. Leaving Todmorden the tourist passes on the right the\r\nprecipitous woods of Erringden, the dene or valley of the Irringas,\r\nwhere of yore probably dwelt a branch of the family of the Aruns; and on\r\nthe other hand, towering far away on the heights to the north may be\r\nseen the bleak, solitary, altar-like mass of rock known as Llads-Law,\r\nconjectured by some to be a Druidical ruin. The Celt lived here beyond\r\nall doubt, though but few are the traces he has left behind in cromlech\r\nor cairn, in speech or blood. The Roman, we know, cut his way through\r\nthe primeval forests, and on these very mountains laid down his military\r\nroads, the long lines of which we can map out, and oft-times does the\r\nplough turn up fragments of rusted sword and broken spear which tell how\r\nthe pierced hand had to drop them for ever. On and near these roads,\r\nafter the iron legions had ceased to tramp them, sprung up many a Saxon\r\n“ton” or town and Danish “by.” There, on the one hand, upon the heights\r\nstill difficult to scale except to born mountaineers, is perched Saxon\r\nHeptonstall, with its grand old tower of Saint Thomas à Becket and\r\nantique homesteads clustering around; and yonder, on the far opposite\r\nslope to the south-east, is Danish Sowerby, taking us back in thought to\r\nthe times when the Vikings settled down and fortified their “by” in the\r\nforest fastnesses of the hill. Here, too, to this Sowerby came later the\r\nEarl of Warren and built himself a castle, and took to his own\r\npossession vast tracts of mountain slope and wooded glen, which long\r\nretained the name of the Forest of Hardwick, and therein he hunted in\r\nright baronial style the boar and the wild deer. Sowerby with its Danish\r\nand Norman memories has a not uninteresting story in later ages, and is\r\nnot a little proud in having given birth to John Tillotson, one of\r\nEngland’s most illustrious primates. Haugh-End, the quaint old house\r\nwhere he was born, is on the southern slope of the hill, and many the\r\npilgrims who turn aside to have a look at the grey old roof sheltered\r\nbehind the trees and the ivied high wall. Not a bow-shot from the\r\nriverside, and nearly opposite Sowerby, is Eawood Hall, the birthplace\r\nof Bishop Ferrar, the martyr. Eawood, snugly and picturesquely nestled\r\nunder the greenwood scars of Midgley, has a conspicuous place in the\r\necclesiastical history of the county. Here John Wesley preached on\r\nseveral occasions, on one of which he remarked, “I preached to near an\r\nhour after sunset. The calmness of the evening agreed well with the\r\nseriousness of the people; every one of whom seemed to drink in the Word\r\nof God as a thirsty land the refreshing showers.” William Grimshaw,\r\ncurate of Todmorden and afterwards incumbent of Haworth, a not unworthy\r\ncoadjutor of Whitefield and the Wesleys, married his first wife from\r\nthis place, and often preached and stayed here on his home-missionary\r\ntours. Not more than a couple of miles away is the birthplace of John\r\nFoster, whose Essays at one time had a considerable reputation. Close to\r\nEawood there is many a neighbouring hall of more than local interest,\r\none especially, Brearley Hall, beautifully embosomed in the trees on a\r\ngentle eminence on the north side of the river, and formerly the seat of\r\na younger branch of the Lacy family. About half an hour’s walk down the\r\nvalley brings the pedestrian to Daisy Bank Wood, and Chaucer’s favourite\r\nflower still grows on the daisied bank, and there stands yet the\r\nold-fashioned house below the wood where was born, in the reign of\r\nElizabeth, Henry Briggs, of logarithm renown, and the first Savilian\r\nprofessor of geometry at the University of Oxford.\r\n\r\n(_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: text decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArchaeology a Confirmation of Historic and Religious Truth.[68]\r\n\r\nBY THE REV. GEORGE HUNTINGTON, M.A., _Rector of Tenby_.\r\n\r\n\r\nJEREMIAH’S lot was cast in the darkest period of his country’s history.\r\nHe was called on to declare the Divine will to the exiles in Babylon and\r\nthe remnant in Palestine. In the context he is warning his countrymen\r\nagainst false prophets and false priests who were deceiving the people\r\nby proclaiming peace when there was no peace. He urges them to inquire\r\nafter the ancient faith revealed to the patriarchs and prophets of old.\r\nThus, and thus only, would they find “rest for their souls.”\r\n\r\nThe metaphor is a striking one; it is that of a traveller who comes to a\r\nplace where several roads meet. He hesitates till he discerns the most\r\nbeaten track, or till he hails another traveller from whom he can ask\r\nhis way. Those were days of doubt and difficulty, when the royal\r\ncounsellors were urging conformity to the idolatrous rites of the\r\npowerful nations around them as a policy of wisdom and conciliation. But\r\nJeremiah regarded it as nothing less than apostasy. Those idolatries\r\nwere abomination in the sight of Jehovah. Hence the people must return\r\nto the worship of the one true God--the God “who made heaven and earth,”\r\nto be true to the covenant which “He made with Abraham, the oath which\r\nHe swore unto Isaac, and confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to\r\nIsrael for an everlasting covenant.”\r\n\r\nBut the text applies to ourselves. The days in which our lot is cast are\r\ndays of doubt and difficulty--days when ancient landmarks are being\r\nremoved, and the beaten tracks so effaced as almost to be indiscernible.\r\nSo that we may well stand, like the traveller in the metaphor, to see\r\nand ask for the old paths, for the good way, amid the clouds of\r\nscepticism and unbelief which gather athwart our pathways; amid the\r\nBabel of voices saying “Who will show us the good?” we may say, with the\r\nPsalmist, “Lord, lift Thou up the light of Thy countenance upon us.”\r\n\r\nFor what are those ways, those old paths, that good way, but the\r\noriginal revelation of God as our Father in heaven--subsequently\r\nmanifested in the Person of His Incarnate Son as the Revealer of the\r\nDivine will, in the dispensation of the Holy Spirit, acting through the\r\nChurch as His agent for making His “ways known to the sons of men.”\r\n\r\n“The history of the race of Adam before the Advent,” says a great\r\nstatesman,[69] “is the history of a long and varied, but incessant\r\npreparation for the Advent;” and the history of the human race since the\r\nAdvent, it may be added, is but a record of the gradual but sure\r\nprogress of that kingdom which Christ came to establish upon earth, an\r\nearnest of the time when the kingdoms of this world shall have become\r\nthe kingdoms of God and of His Christ, and He shall reign for ever and\r\never as King of kings and Lord of lords.\r\n\r\nAnd to this, as it seems to me, all historical research as well as\r\nscientific discovery points. There are those who to exalt Christianity\r\nwould represent the world as in total darkness before the Advent. The\r\ntruer estimate of the Gospels shows us that Christ was in fact the “true\r\nLight that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.” The\r\ninvestigation of the records of the past assures us of this fact,\r\nconfirms us in this belief, proves to us that God never “left Himself\r\nwithout witness,” teaches us that Christ drew as it were into a focus\r\nall the truths that men had previously held, only freeing them from\r\nerror and bringing them into clearer light. “The words,” says a great\r\nscholar,[70] “by which God was known in the far-off ages are but mere\r\nwords; but they bring before us with all the vividness of an event which\r\nwe witnessed ourselves but yesterday, the ancestors of the whole Aryan\r\nrace, thousands of years, it may be, before Homer and the Vedas,\r\nworshipping an unseen Being under the self-same name, the best, the most\r\nexalted name they could find in their vocabulary.” Plutarch wrote ages\r\nago: “If you travel through the whole world, well, you may find cities\r\nwithout walls, without literature, without kings, moneyless, and such as\r\ndesire no coin; which know not what theatres or public halls or bodily\r\nexercise mean; but never was there, nor ever shall be, any one city seen\r\nwithout temple, church, or chapel, without some God or other, which\r\nuseth no prayers, nor oaths, no prophecies and divinations, no\r\nsacrifices either to obtain good blessings, or to avert heavy curses and\r\ncalamities. Nay, methinks a man should sooner find a city built in the\r\nair without any plot of ground whereon it is seated than any\r\ncommonwealth altogether void of religion.... This is that containeth and\r\nholdeth together all human society, this is the foundation prop and stay\r\nof all.”[71]\r\n\r\nBrethren of the Archæological Association, I venture to think that you\r\nwill not fail to see the application of these remarks to your own\r\nresearches, and to the consequences which are happily arising from these\r\nresearches. Of course I speak of archæology in its widest sense. Your\r\ninvestigations of the records of antiquity, your examination of ancient\r\nremains, your discovery of the sites and foundations of temples, tombs,\r\naltars, and cromlechs, confirm the testimony of philologists,\r\nhistorians, and philosophers, nay the witness of the human heart; they\r\nall speak with more or less clearness of a belief in the Supreme Being,\r\nof a longing for a clearer revelation of His will, of a hope of\r\nimmortality, of a sense of sin and desire for reconciliation with Him,\r\nobscured it may be, often perverted, debased by superstitious, cruel,\r\nand unholy rites, sometimes feebly held, but never totally lost.\r\n\r\nAnd the same observations apply to the attestation by archæology to the\r\nscriptural records. Nothing is more remarkable than the recovery of\r\nancient monuments, unless it be the deductions of science which are\r\nmarking the intellectual activity of the age. What a revelation was that\r\nfinding of the famous Rosetta stone[72] which by its triple inscription\r\nin the Sacred, the popular Egyptian, and the Greek languages, gave the\r\nkey to unlock the mysteries of figure writing, so that thanks to\r\nEgyptologists, who are but archæologists under a local name, we may\r\npicture to ourselves the Egypt of the Pyramids, of Abraham, of Joseph,\r\nand the Exodus, and see the Pharaohs in their colossal palaces, and\r\nlearn something of that wisdom of the Egyptians in which we are told\r\n“Moses was learned.” Think, too, how the unshapely mounds on the banks\r\nof the Euphrates have given up their treasures, so that we may now know\r\nthe history of those mighty empires which each in its day exercised its\r\ninfluence on the chosen people, and through that chosen people on the\r\ndestinies of the Church. Think of the excavations of a Layard, the\r\nresearches of a Rawlinson in Babylon and Assyria, and of the Palestine\r\nexplorers, which bring before us not only the land of the Judges and the\r\nKings, but the scenes of the earthly ministry of the Son of God Himself.\r\n\r\nAnd what is it but archæology that led to the exhuming of those\r\nlong-lost cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii which have thrown such a\r\nlurid glare on the morals of the Græco-Roman world, confirming as it\r\ndoes the keen satires not only of a Juvenal or a Persius, but the\r\nmournful testimony of a Paul, showing as nothing else could show the\r\nworld’s need of a divine Saviour, and a newer and fuller revelation of\r\nthe Divine will.\r\n\r\nOr think of the identification of the sites of classic Troy and Mycenæ\r\nby Dr. Schliemann, and of the discoveries of Mr. Wood at Ephesus, and of\r\nMr. Ramsay in Phrygia. These investigations might seem to have only an\r\nindirect reference to Christianity, but they may help to attest the\r\naccuracy of the Scripture record and of the history of the isapostolic\r\nChurch. Asia Minor, be it remembered, was, next to Palestine, the\r\ntheatre of the earliest apostolic labours; Ephesus was the city wherein\r\nSt. Paul encountered the worshippers of the Temple of the world-renowned\r\nArtemis. To the Ephesians he addressed one of his most remarkable\r\nepistles, to Ephesus he sent his son in the faith, Timothy; over the\r\nEphesian Church St. John presided as the survivor of the Twelve; in\r\nEphesus was held the third of the Œcumenical Councils. Who knows,\r\nthen, what the archæology of the future may not discover in these\r\ninteresting regions? What treasures may not yet be buried under those\r\nshapeless masses, the accumulations of ages of neglect? Who knows what\r\nlight they may not shed on the annals of a hoary antiquity in which we\r\nof this busy nineteenth century may be vitally interested?--interested\r\nas we “ask for the old paths.”\r\n\r\nThe same may be said of the Catacombs of Rome, with their simple and\r\nunstudied testimony to the faith of the early Christian martyrs, so\r\nstrangely contrasting with the sad records of the pagan world, so that,\r\nas has well been said, “if you cross the Appian Way, from the Columbaria\r\nto the Catacombs, and place side by side the heathen and the Christian\r\nepitaphs, you may read, in those authentic registers, how, without\r\nChrist, death meant despair; with Christ, peace.”\r\n\r\nThink again of the recovery of MSS. I need name but one, the Codex\r\nSinaiticus, found seemingly by a lucky accident, but one which has\r\nenabled New Testament scholars to establish the truest readings of the\r\nGospels and the Epistles. Nor is the discovery of an authentic copy of\r\nthat ancient treatise which goes by the name of the “Teaching of the\r\nTwelve Apostles” without its influence on Christian archæology. It\r\nconfirms what the examination of the ancient liturgies of ancient altars\r\nand altar vessels--a distinct branch of your science--teaches us, the\r\ntestimony of a Pliny and a Justin as to what primitive Christian worship\r\nreally was; it assures the Churchman of the nineteenth century that in\r\nall essentials of faith and worship he is one with the Church of the\r\nfirst century, the Church of the Apostles, the Church of Pentecost, the\r\nChurch of Christ from the beginning.\r\n\r\nBut you are British archæologists; if it pleases you to visit my native\r\ncounty of York, you will doubtless direct your steps to Goodmanham, or\r\nGodmundenham, as its ancient name betokened--the Protection of the Gods.\r\nThere in that little East Riding village archæology verified the\r\nidentity of the font in which Paulinus baptized the heathen priest\r\nCoifi, with a trough out of which for years farmers had fed their swine.\r\nWhat a commentary on the spread of Christianity, and the need of\r\nChristianity, so early as the seventh century in the northern parts of\r\nour island is the beautiful story told by the Venerable Bede.[73] “The\r\npresent life of man,” said the aged counsellor Coifi to his sovereign,\r\n“O king, seems to me in comparison of that time which is unknown to us,\r\nlike the swift flight of the sparrow through the room wherein you sit at\r\nsupper in winter with your commanders and ministers, and a good fire in\r\nthe midst, whilst the storms of rain and snow prevail abroad; the\r\nsparrow, I say, flying in at one door and immediately out at another,\r\nwhilst he is within is safe from the wintry storm, but after a short\r\nspace of fair weather he immediately vanishes out of your sight into the\r\ndark winter from which he had emerged. So this life of man appears for a\r\nshort space, but of what went before or what is to follow we are utterly\r\nignorant. If, therefore, the new doctrine contains something more\r\ncertain, it seems justly to deserve to be followed.” In contempt of his\r\nformer superstition, the king and his counsellors assenting, we are\r\ntold, the arch-priest mounted the royal war-horse, armed himself with a\r\nspear, things otherwise unlawful, and profaned the temple by casting at\r\nthe idol his spear; and then both king and counsellor were baptized and\r\nprofessed the faith of Christ.[74]\r\n\r\nAuthorities have been divided as to the diffusion of Christianity in\r\nBritain, and as to the independence of the ancient British Church.\r\nArchæology, on the other hand, by its identification of sacred sites by\r\nthe nomenclature of native saints, by the designation of parishes and\r\nchurches, has done much to settle these questions. The science of\r\narchæology has discovered Christian symbols, traced British bishops to\r\nfar-distant Councils;[75] as at Carleon, and Bangor, and elsewhere, it\r\nhas unfolded the records of a community acting under its own prelates\r\nand arch-prelates, enjoying its own native customs, adhering to its own\r\nindependent rites.\r\n\r\nArchæology is, in its widest sense, no mere question of curious\r\nantiquities, it is a confirmation of historic and religious truth. It\r\naids the devout in the inquiry after the old ways in which the saints of\r\nGod have trod. It is a teaching and a walking in that good way in which\r\npatriarchs and prophets, apostles and martyrs, found rest to their\r\nsouls. To the Jews of Jeremiah’s days God promised rest from their\r\nenemies in their own land of promise, rest in the assured favour of\r\nJehovah. To us Christ promises rest, rest from disquieting doubts and\r\nfears, rest in the sense of sins forgiven, rest in communion and union\r\nwith God and Christ, in the mystical fellowship of His Body, the Church,\r\nrest hereafter in our heavenly home.\r\n\r\nBrethren, the appeal of Christ is to the individual heart, the witness\r\nto the Saviour is in the testimony of conscience, the heart and life,\r\nthe presence of His Spirit within the soul. May I beg you, then, to ask\r\nfor the old paths of repentance and faith, for the good way that leadeth\r\nto life, to walk therein; to consecrate your researches to the highest\r\nand noblest of purposes, the furtherance of truth and the glory of God;\r\nand so, to use again the words of the prophet in the text, “ye shall\r\nfind rest for your souls.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: text decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohnson and Garrick.\r\n\r\n_A JEU D’ESPRIT[76] BY SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS._\r\n\r\n_PART II._\r\n\r\n(_Continued from p. 175._)\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTINUING the dialogue between Dr. Johnson and Mr. Gibbon from the\r\npoint where we broke off in our last, the _jeu d’esprit_ proceeds:--\r\n\r\nGIBBON.--Garrick had some flippancy of parts, to be sure, and was brisk\r\nand lively in company, and by the help of mimickry and story-telling\r\nmade himself a pleasant companion; but here, the whole world gave the\r\nsuperiority to Foote, and Garrick himself appears to have felt as if his\r\ngenius was rebuked by the superior powers of Foote. It has been often\r\nobserved, that Garrick never dared to enter into competition with him,\r\nbut was content to act an under part to bring Foote out.\r\n\r\nJOHNSON.--That this conduct of Garrick’s might be interpreted by the\r\ngross minds of Foote and his friends as if he was afraid to encounter\r\nhim, I can easily imagine. Of the natural superiority of Garrick over\r\nFoote, this conduct is an instance; he disdained entering into\r\ncompetition with such a fellow, and made him the buffoon of the company,\r\nor, as you may say, brought him out, and what was at last brought out\r\nbut coarse jests and vulgar merriment, indecency, and impiety, a\r\nrelation of events which, upon the face of them, could never have\r\nhappened, characters grossly conceived and as coarsely represented.\r\nFoote was even no mimick; he went out of himself, it is true, but\r\nwithout going into another man; he was excelled by Garrick even in this,\r\nwhich is considered as Foote’s greatest excellence. Garrick, besides his\r\nexact imitation of the voice and gestures of his original, to a degree\r\nof refinement of which Foote had no conception, exhibited the mind and\r\nmode of thinking of the person imitated. Besides, Garrick confined his\r\npowers within the limits of decency: he had a character to preserve,\r\nFoote had none. By Foote’s buffoonery and broadfaced merriment, private\r\nfriendship, public decency, and everything estimable amongst men, were\r\ntrod under foot. We all know the difference of their reception in the\r\nworld. No man, however high in rank or literature, but was proud to know\r\nGarrick, and was glad to have him at his table; no man ever considered\r\nor treated Garrick as a player; he may be said to have stepped out of\r\nhis own rank into an higher, and by raising himself he raised the rank\r\nof his profession. At a convivial table his exhilarating powers were\r\nunrivalled; he was lively, entertaining, quick in discerning the\r\nridicule of life, and as ready in representing it, and on graver\r\nsubjects there were few topics on which he could not bear a part. It is\r\ninjurious to the character of Garrick to be named in the same breath\r\nwith Foote. That Foote was admitted sometimes into good company (to do\r\nthe man what credit I can) I will allow, but then it was merely to play\r\ntricks; Foote’s merriment was that of a buffoon, and Garrick’s that of a\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nG.--I have been told, on the contrary, that Garrick in company had not\r\nthe easy manners of a gentleman.\r\n\r\nJ.--Sir, I do not know what you may have been told, or what your ideas\r\nmay be of the manners of gentlemen. Garrick had no vulgarity in his\r\nmanners; it is true, he had not the airiness of a fop, nor did he assume\r\nan affected indifference to what was passing; he did not lounge from the\r\ntable to the window, and from thence to the fire, or whilst you were\r\naddressing your discourse to him, turn from you, and talk to his next\r\nneighbour, or give any indication that he was tired of your company. If\r\nsuch manners form your ideas of a fine gentleman, Garrick certainly had\r\nthem not.\r\n\r\nG.--I mean that Garrick was more overawed by the presence of the great,\r\nand more obsequious to rank than Foote, who considered himself as their\r\nequal, and treated them with the same familiarity as they treated each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nJ.--He did so, and what did the fellow get by it? The grossness of his\r\nmind prevented him from seeing that this familiarity was merely suffered\r\nas they would play with a dog. He got no ground by affecting to call\r\npeers by their surnames. The foolish fellow fancied, that lowering them\r\nwas raising himself to their level. This affectation of familiarity with\r\nthe great, this childish ambition of momentary exaltation, obtained by\r\nthe neglect of those ceremonies which custom has established as the\r\nbarriers between one order of society and another, only showed his folly\r\nand meanness; he did not see that by encroaching on others’ dignity, he\r\nputs himself in their power, either to be repelled with helpless\r\nindignity, or endured by clemency and condescension. Garrick by paying\r\ndue regard to rank respected himself; what he gave was returned, and\r\nwhat was returned he kept for ever. His advancement was on firm ground;\r\nhe was recognised in public as well as respected in private, and as no\r\nman was ever more courted or better received by the public, so no man\r\nwas ever less spoiled by its flattery. Garrick continued advancing to\r\nthe last, till he had acquired every advantage that high birth could\r\nbestow, except the precedence of going into the room, but when he was\r\nthere he was treated with as much attention as the first man at the\r\ntable. It is to the credit of Garrick that he never laid any claim to\r\nthis distinction; it was as voluntarily allowed as if it had been his\r\nbirthright. In this, I confess, I looked on David with some degree of\r\nenvy, not so much for the respect he received as for the manner of its\r\nbeing acquired: what fell into his lap unsought, I have been forced to\r\nclaim. I began the world by fighting my way. There was something about\r\nme that invited insult, or at least a disposition to neglect, and I was\r\nequally disposed to repel insult, and to claim attention, and, I fear,\r\ncontinue too much in this disposition now it is no longer necessary; I\r\nreceive at present as much favour as I have a right to expect. I am not\r\none of the complainers of the neglect of merit.\r\n\r\nG.--_Your_ pretensions, Dr. Johnson, nobody will dispute; I cannot place\r\nGarrick on the same footing: your reputation will continue increasing\r\nafter your death. When Garrick will be totally forgot, you will be for\r\never considered as a classic.\r\n\r\nJ.--Enough, sir, enough; the company will be better pleased to see us\r\nquarrel than bandying compliments.\r\n\r\nG.--But you must allow, Dr. Johnson, that Garrick was too much a slave\r\nto fame, or rather to the mean ambition of living with the great,\r\nterribly afraid of making himself cheap with them; by which he debarred\r\nhimself from much pleasant society. Employing so much attention and so\r\nmuch management upon such little things, implies, I think, a little\r\nmind. It was observed by his friend Coleman that he never went into\r\ncompany but with a plot how to get out of it; he was every minute called\r\nout, and went off or returned as there was, or was not, a probability of\r\nhis shining.\r\n\r\nJ.--In regard to his mean ambition, as you call it, of living with the\r\ngreat, what was the boast of Pope, and is every man’s wish, can be no\r\nreproach to Garrick; he who says he despises it, knows he lies. That\r\nGarrick husbanded his fame, the fame which he had justly acquired, both\r\nat the theatre and at the table, is not denied; but where is the blame\r\neither in the one or the other of leaving as little as possible to\r\nchance? Besides, sir, consider what you have said; you first deny\r\nGarrick’s pretensions to fame, and then accuse him of too great an\r\nattention to preserve what he never possessed.\r\n\r\nG.--I don’t understand.\r\n\r\nJ.--I can’t help that, sir.\r\n\r\nG.--Well but, Dr. Johnson, you will not vindicate him in his over and\r\nabove attention to his fame, his inordinate desire to exhibit himself to\r\nnew men, like a coquet ever seeking after new conquests, to the total\r\nneglect of old friends and admirers:\r\n\r\n    “He threw off his friends, like a huntsman his pack:”\r\n\r\nalways looking out for new game.\r\n\r\nJ.--When you have quoted the line from Goldsmith, you ought, in fairness\r\nto have given what followed,\r\n\r\n    “He knew when he pleased, he could whistle them back:”\r\n\r\nwhich implies at least that he possessed a power over other men’s minds\r\napproaching to fascination. But consider, sir, what is to be done. Here\r\nis a man, whom every other man desired to know. Garrick could not\r\nreceive and cultivate all, according to each man’s conception of his own\r\nvalue: we are all apt enough to consider ourselves as possessing a right\r\nto be exempted from the common crowd. Besides, sir, I do not see why\r\nthat should be imputed to him as a crime which we all so irresistibly\r\nfeel and practise; we all make a greater exertion in the presence of new\r\nmen than old acquaintance; it is undoubtedly true that Garrick divided\r\nhis attention among so many, that but little remained to the share of an\r\nindividual: like the extension and dissipation of water into dew, there\r\nwas not quantity united sufficiently to quench any man’s thirst; but\r\nthis is the inevitable state of things; Garrick no more than any other\r\nman could unite what was in their nature incompatible.\r\n\r\nG.--But Garrick was by this means not only excluded from real\r\nfriendship, but also accused of treating those whom he called friends\r\nwith insincerity and double dealings.\r\n\r\nJ.--Sir, it is not true; his character in that respect is misunderstood:\r\nGarrick was, to be sure, very ready in promising, but he intended at\r\nthat time to fulfil his promise; he intended no deceit; his politeness,\r\nor his good nature, call it which you will, made him unwilling to deny,\r\nhe wanted the courage to say _No_, even to unreasonable demands. This\r\nwas the great error of his life; by raising expectations which he did\r\nnot, perhaps could not, gratify, he made enemies; at the same time it\r\nmust be remembered that this error proceeded from the same cause which\r\nproduced many of his virtues. Friendships from warmth of temper too\r\nsuddenly taken up, and too violent to continue, ended, as they were like\r\nto do, in disappointment; enmity succeeded disappointment, his friends\r\nbecame his enemies, and those having been fostered in his bosom, knew\r\nwell his sensibility to reproach, and they took care that he should be\r\namply supplied with such bitter potions as they were capable of\r\nadministering. Their impotent efforts he ought to have despised, but he\r\nfelt them; nor did he affect insensibility.\r\n\r\nG.--And that sensibility probably shortened his life.\r\n\r\nJ.--No, sir, he died of a disorder of which you or any other man may die\r\nwithout being killed by too much sensibility.\r\n\r\nG.--But you will allow, however, that this sensibility, those fine\r\nfeelings, made him the great actor he was.\r\n\r\nJ.--This is all cant, fit only for kitchen wenches and chamber maids;\r\nGarrick’s trade was to represent passion, not to feel it. Ask Reynolds,\r\nwhether he felt the distress of Count Ugolino, when he drew it.\r\n\r\nG.--But surely he feels the passion at the moment he is representing it.\r\n\r\nJ.--About as much as Punch feels. That Garrick himself gave in to this\r\nfoppery of feelings, I can easily believe; but he knew at the time that\r\nhe lied. He might think it right, as far as I know, to have what fools\r\nimagined he ought to have; but it is amazing that anyone should be so\r\nignorant as to think that an actor will risk his reputation by depending\r\nupon the feelings, that may be excited in the presence of 200 people, on\r\nthe repetition of certain words which he has repeated 200 times before\r\nin what actors call their study. No, sir, Garrick left nothing to\r\nchance; every gesture, every expression of countenance, and variation of\r\nvoice, was settled in his closet, before he set his foot upon the stage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: text decoration]\r\n\r\n     MR. ALEXANDER GARDNER, of Paisley, has in hand a little series of\r\n     books, which he proposes to name “The Antiquarian Library.” The\r\n     series will consist chiefly of original works, and will be\r\n     introduced by the following books from the pen of Mr. William\r\n     Andrews: “Gibbet Lore: Remarkable Chapters in the Annals of Great\r\n     Britain and Ireland,” “Obsolete Punishments,” “History of Bells and\r\n     Wells: Their History, Legends, Superstitions, Folk-lore, and\r\n     Poetry.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe History of Gilds.\r\n\r\nBY CORNELIUS WALFORD, F.S.S., _Barrister-at-Law_.\r\n\r\n_PART IV._\r\n\r\n(_Continued from p. 181._)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.--_Gilds of Norfolk._\r\n\r\nTHIS county was remarkable for the number of its Gilds, every principal\r\ntown having many, and most of the villages one or more. The following is\r\nbelieved to be a complete return of the Gilds existing in 1388-9. All\r\nthe towns are easy of identification.\r\n\r\n=East Wynch.=--In this town (or village) there was the following:--\r\n\r\n_Gild of Est Wynch_, founded 1377.--Four meetings shall be held every\r\nyear. Officers to be chosen by picked men. Services for dead, and\r\nofferings. Masses for the souls of the dead. Allowances to members in\r\nsickness, viz., “a lof, and a potel of ale, and mes of kechen [stuff].”\r\n\r\n=Lynn.=--The Gilds existing in this then famous seaport (at the date above\r\nnamed) were the following--the chief features of each being noted.\r\n\r\n_Gild of the Nativity of St. John Baptist_, founded 1316.--Three\r\nmeetings shall be held every year, to which every brother and sister\r\nmust come under penalty. Officers shall be chosen by picked men; those\r\nnot serving to pay a fine. The stewards shall find sureties for the\r\ngoods of the Gild, and render an account at the yearly general meeting.\r\nEvery feast shall be begun with a prayer; the Gild-candle shall burn the\r\nwhile; and all that are there shall be noiseless. Services for the dead,\r\nand offerings. New members shall undertake to keep the ordinances, and\r\nshall pay the usual house-fees and entrance-money. Masses for the souls\r\nof the dead.

The Gild shall go to\r\nchurch in procession on the day of their yearly meeting, and hear mass,\r\nand make offerings. Help to poor bretheren and sisteren. The funds of\r\nthe Gild at this date appear to have amounted to £4 1s.--this indeed\r\nrepresenting a large amount of our present coinage--held by its four\r\nprincipal officers. Another Gild with the same name is mentioned later.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. Peter_ (at Lenne), founded 1329 [or 1339].--Four meetings\r\nshall be held every year, at each of which every brother and sister\r\nshall pay a halfpenny towards maintaining a light burning during divine\r\nservice. Penalty for not coming to any meeting. The Dean shall be fined\r\nif he fail to summon any. Officers shall be chosen by picked men; those\r\nchosen and not serving shall be fined. Services for the dead, and\r\nofferings; and bretheren not coming, if able, shall be fined. Masses for\r\nthe soul. The Alderman shall deliver the goods to the Stewards, upon\r\nsurety given to render account thereof at the yearly general meeting.\r\nAllowances to the officers on feast days. New-comers shall undertake to\r\nkeep these statutes; and shall at once pay the usual entrance-money or\r\nfind sureties. The Dean’s salary vj_d._ in the year. Any brother or\r\nsister wronging another shall be fined. Help to be given to poor\r\nbretheren.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. Nicholas_ in Lenne Petri (West Lynn), founded 1359.--Four\r\nmeetings in the year; whoever grumbles shall be fined. No one shall\r\nenter the buttery where the ale lies.\r\n\r\n_Gild of the Purification_, in Bishop’s Lynn, founded 1367.--This was a\r\nsocial Gild “in ye honuraunce of ihesu crist of heuene, And of his moder\r\nseinte marie, and of alle halowene, and speciallike of ye Purificacioun\r\nof oure lady seint marie.” Its features were like other of the\r\nReligio-Social Gilds of the town.\r\n\r\n_The Shipmanes Gild_, founded 1368.--Three meetings shall be held every\r\nyear, on days named, or as the Alderman shall appoint. Every brother\r\nmust come to every meeting, if able. The Dean shall be fined if he fail\r\nto summon any.

No Gild-brother shall give pledge or become surety for\r\nanother, in any plea or suit, without leave of the Alderman and others.\r\nThe Alderman, &c., shall do their best to adjust the quarrel; but if\r\nunable, shall give leave to make suit at law. Fine for disobedience.\r\nAllowances to the officers on feast days. Help to poor bretheren.\r\nPayments shall be made for every voyage; and a yearly payment if no\r\nvoyage made. The ale-chamber not to be entered. New-comers shall swear\r\nto maintain the Ordinances of the Gild. New-comers must undertake to\r\ncome to the yearly meetings, if at home, and must make their payments.\r\nThe liveryhood shall be kept for two years. On death of a brother, all\r\nthe rest shall be summoned, and shall come to the service in their\r\nlivery-hoods, and make offerings. None shall leave until the service is\r\ndone; fine for default.\r\n\r\nA new Ordinance was made for this Gild in 1381, viz., burial service in\r\nthe case of any brother dying out of town. In 1382 another new\r\nOrdinance, viz., burial service for those dying in West Lynn and South\r\nLynn.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that this was a Gild of a superior order, more after the\r\nnature of a Merchant-Gild.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. John Baptist_, in Bishop’s Lynn, founded 1372.--This\r\npartook of the general character of the Social Gilds of the town, except\r\nthat there seemed to be no special provision for the poor members in\r\nsickness, &c. The ordinances provided that there should be no\r\nquarrelling during any feast-time or meeting. Moneys were to be\r\ncontributed towards the Gild-stock, and the ale.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. John Baptist_, in West Lynn, founded in 1374.--Services for\r\ndead, and offerings. The Dean shall buy waste bread with these\r\nofferings, and give it [to the poor]. Penalty on anyone disputing any of\r\nthese Ordinances.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. George the Martyr_, founded in 1376.--A priest shall be\r\nfound to serve at the altar of St. George. Candles and torches shall be\r\nfound to burn during the service, and at burials. Services for the dead,\r\nand offerings.

The Gild shall go to church on the\r\nday of yearly meeting, and hear mass and make offerings. The affairs of\r\nthe Gild not to be disclosed. The Stewards to find sureties for the\r\ngoods, and to render account at the yearly general meeting. Every feast\r\nshall be begun with a prayer, the Gild-light burning the while; and they\r\nthat are there making no noise nor jangling. New members admitted only\r\nat the yearly general meeting, and with the assent of all; save good men\r\nfrom the country. New members shall undertake to keep the Ordinances,\r\nand shall pay the usual house-fees as well as entrance-money. If any\r\nquarrel arise, it shall be told to the Alderman, who shall do his best\r\nto settle it. Livery-hoods to be worn at the meetings, and at every\r\nburial service. Breakers of the Ordinances, after three fines shall be\r\nput out of the Gild. Salary of the Clerk iii_s._ iv_d._, and of the Dean\r\nij_s._ the year. The funds of the Gild consisted of £3 3s.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. Thomas of Canterbury_ (in Lenne), founded 1376.--The Gild,\r\nall fairly arrayed, shall meet on St. Thomas’s Day, and hear mass, and\r\nmake offerings. There shall be four other general meetings in the course\r\nof each year. An Alderman shall be chosen, and four Stewards, and a Dean\r\nand Clerk. A large wax candle shall be kept burning. The order of burial\r\nservices defined. Wrongdoers shall be put out. New-comers shall pay 5s.\r\neach. If any become poor, or have loss by sea, or by fire, or otherwise,\r\nhelp shall be given. Assent given to these Ordinances. Wages of Clerk to\r\nbe iij_s_., and of Dean xviij_d._ for the year.\r\n\r\n_The Gild of Young Scholars_, founded 1383.--Gifts were received in\r\nsupport of the Gild. Burial services defined. Help in case of poverty,\r\nloss at sea, or other mishap. Three speakings together [assemblies] of\r\nthe Gild shall be held every year; accounts shall be then rendered. All\r\nthe brethren shall go to church on one day in the year, and hear mass\r\nand make offerings. Misdoers shall be put out. Officers shall be chosen.\r\nIt was stated that all the goods of the Gild had been spent, but more\r\nwere hoped for.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. Thomas of Canterbury_ (at Lenne).--Four meetings to be held\r\nevery year, to which all must come under penalty. New-comers shall pay\r\nthe usual house-fees. Attendance at meetings must be punctual. Services\r\nfor the dead, and offerings. Masses for the soul. Sureties and\r\nentrance-money for new-comers. Allowances to the officers on feast days.\r\nHelp to the poor. Allowances to the sick. No noise to be made during the\r\nfeast time.

Other\r\nfeatures general.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. Edmund_, in North Lynn.--A Religio-Social Gild with special\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n_Gild of Candlemass_, in North Lynn.--No special features.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. Lawrence_, in Bishop’s Lynn.--It had no special features\r\ndiffering from the Social Gilds of the town.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. Edmund_, in Bishop’s Lynn.--This again had no special\r\nfeatures. The entrance-money iiiij_s._\r\n\r\n_Gild of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist_ (another).--Three\r\nmeetings shall be held every year, to which every brother and sister\r\nmust come under penalty. The Dean shall be fined if he fail to summon\r\nany. New-comers shall pay the usual house-fees. Services for the dead,\r\nand offerings. Penalty for betraying the affairs of the Gild. Officers\r\nchosen and not serving shall be fined. Masses for souls of the dead. The\r\nale chamber not to be entered. Salaries of the Dean and the Clerk\r\nprovided for. The Stewards to find sureties for the goods of the Gild,\r\nand render an account at the yearly general meeting. No man shall stay\r\nin the Gild-house after the Alderman has left. Allowances to the\r\nofficers on Gild-days, and to sick bretheren and sisteren. Help to poor\r\nbretheren and sisteren.

A few special\r\nOrdinances obtained. If one brother belie another, he shall be fined. If\r\nanyone is foul-mouthed to the Alderman at any meeting, he shall be\r\nfined. If anyone wrong another, he shall be fined. None shall come to\r\nthe feast in a tabard, nor in a cloak, nor with legs bare, nor barefoot.\r\nIf anyone make a noise during the feast, he shall do penance by holding\r\nthe rod, else pay a fine. No one shall sleep, nor keep the ale-cup to\r\nhimself. Help to poor bretheren and sisteren [record incomplete].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gild of the Holy Cross_, in Bishop’s Lynn.--The chief distinctive\r\nfeature of this Gild was that allowances were made to the bretheren and\r\nsisteren during sickness, but also while on pilgrimage. No brother was\r\nto go to law with another without leave of the Alderman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. Anthony_ (in Lenne).--Founded (date uncertain) “in the\r\nWorchep of God of heuen, and of his modir seynt Mari, and alle the holy\r\nCompany of heuen, and souerengly of the Noble confessour seynt Antony.”\r\nThe Gild shall meet in church and hear mass and make offerings. There\r\nshall be four other general meetings of the Gild in each year.\r\nNew-comers (members) shall pay 5s. each. A wise Alderman shall be\r\nchosen, and 4 trusty Stewards, and a summoning Dean, and a Clerk. Burial\r\nservices on death of members, and offerings. In cases of loss of cattle,\r\nor personal sickness, help to be given. Wages of the Clerk and Dean to\r\nbe xij_d._ each “for his trauaile in the yere.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. Leonard._--There shall be four general meetings every year;\r\nat the first there shall be chosen an Alderman and four Stewards, a\r\nDean, and a Clerk. New-comers shall pay 3s. each. Burial services\r\ndefined. In case of loss by sea, or other mishap, help shall be given.\r\nIf death outside the town, the body shall be fetched at cost of the\r\nGild. Prisoners shall be visited and comforted. Rebels against canon law\r\nshall be put out.\r\n\r\n_Gild of the Purification._--The Gild shall meet on Candlemas-day, and\r\nhave besides three meetings every year. No special features. Help to\r\nthose in trouble.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. Mary._--Services for the dead and offerings. Masses for the\r\nsouls of the dead. No special features.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. Katherine._--A candle shall be kept burning in the church\r\nof St. Margaret; and on the Feast of St. Katherine offerings shall be\r\nmade. New members to pay 5s. entrance-fee. Masses for the souls of the\r\ndead. No special features.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. James._--Help to poor bretheren and sisteren. No special\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n_Gild of the Conception_, in Bishop’s Lynn.--There were to be four\r\nmeetings in the year; every brother and sister was to pay 1d. towards\r\nfinding a light on festival days; and any member summoned and not\r\nattending was to be fined; remainder of the features in common with\r\nother Gilds of the town.\r\n\r\nMost of the preceding are seen to be religious Gilds--perhaps all except\r\nthe “Shipmanes” [_i.e._ Shipmasters] of 1368. The following were of the\r\nmercantile class:--\r\n\r\n_Gild of the Holy Trinity_ [Merchants Gild].--This was the great\r\nmercantile Gild of the town, and had very considerable possessions in\r\nland, houses, and other property. It was reputed to have taken its rise\r\nin the reign of King John, in the sixth year of whose reign the Gild\r\nreceived Letters Patents authorising one of its body to be mayor of the\r\ntown. The Gild itself was unquestionably of older date. At the date of\r\nthe Reformation the Gild was sustaining thirteen chaplains, “daily and\r\nyearly to pray, as well for the King, his ancestors, and for the peace\r\nand welfare of his kingdom, as for the souls of the Aldermen, bretheren,\r\nand benefactors of the said Gild, also for the souls of the faithful\r\ndeceased.”\r\n\r\n_The Gild of Shoemakers._--No details available.\r\n\r\n_The Red Gild._--The particular objects of this Gild, or even the\r\ncircumstances which led to the adoption of its name, have hitherto\r\ndefied all inquiry.\r\n\r\n_The Gild of St. William_, trading to North Bern. This was probably a\r\ngild of merchants trading to North Bergen (Norway). Lynn had carried on\r\na considerable trade with the North of Europe from a very early period,\r\nand many Lynn merchants resided in those parts. There is in the\r\nCorporation records a letter in Latin, bearing date 1305, from\r\nBartholomew, the King of Norway’s Chancellor, to the Mayor of Lynn, in\r\nbehalf of Thurkill and other merchants residing there. It was customary\r\nfor the merchants of Lynn to have a consul of their own--an\r\nAlderman--appointed for Norway. To this end a royal warrant was\r\nnecessary. Here is a copy of such a document issued by Henry V. (first\r\nhalf of fifteenth century):--\r\n\r\n“HENRY, by the grace of God, King of England and of France, and\r\nLord of Ireland.\r\n\r\nTo our trusty and well-beloved the Mayor, Aldermen, and other merchants\r\ninhabiting within our town of Lynn, shewed unto us, that by the old\r\nprivilege among you, used in exercising the sale of your merchandises in\r\nthe lands and countries of Denmark and Norway, ye have an ancient custom\r\nto have an Alderman chosen by election among you, to be ruler and\r\ngovernor of your Company in the said countries, and to see good rule and\r\norder kept amongst you there, which we woll be content to help and see\r\nto be holden for the increasing and augmentation of the common weal and\r\nprosperity of you and all other our true subjects; we having the same in\r\nour good remembrance, be content and woll, that ye godre and assemble\r\ntoguider, and among you chuse such oon to be your said Alderman, as ye\r\nshall think convenient, good, honest, and sufficient for the premisses:\r\nand to use, have, enjoy, and occupy the liberties and franchises in this\r\ncause heretofore accustomed. Yeven under our Signet at our manor of\r\nGreenwich, the 18th day of July, the fifth year of our reign.”\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered in this connection that Lynn was one of the\r\ntrading stations of the Hanseatic League.\r\n\r\nThere seem to have been several Gild-halls in the town, viz., those of\r\nthe Gilds of the _Trinity_ and of _St. George_ respectively, and it is\r\nsupposed of various others. In vol. i. of Richards’ “History of Lynn”\r\nwill be found many additional details of interest regarding the Gilds of\r\nthis town.\r\n\r\n(_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: text decoration]\r\n\r\n     AN ancient stained glass panel representing a pedlar and his dog\r\n     has lately been removed from a window of Lambeth Church, to give\r\n     place to a new memorial window.

I inclose a transcript of\r\nit, and, if it is not too much trouble, humbly (_sic_) the Favor of You\r\nto fill in up that word, and send this Letter back to Mr. Astle at the\r\nPaper Office. I am obliged to print that Extract as it is in the\r\nPetition, and therefore you will be so good as not to give yourself the\r\nTrouble to write out the whole Extract.\r\n\r\nBegging of You to excuse this Trouble, I remain,\r\nSir, Your most obedient humble Servant,\r\nPHIL. MORANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nHANG\r\nTo\r\n\r\nAbraham Farley, Esq.\r\n\r\n[This letter was written by the Rev. P. Morant, the historian of Essex,\r\nwhile residing at Lambeth, whither he had removed early in this year, as\r\nbeing appointed to succeed Mr. Blyke in the work of preparing for the\r\npress a copy of the “Rolls of Parliament.” The “Mr. Astle” to whom it\r\nrefers was Thomas Astle, Esq., Keeper of the Records, who married\r\nMorant’s daughter. It was in crossing over from Lambeth to his work that\r\nMorant caught the chill from which he died.[77]--J. H.

The poet, himself, however, has entered the dates\r\n     of the birth of his children, which are given with commendable\r\n     precision. Thus--“Anne, my daughter, was born July 29, the day of\r\n     the monthly Fast, between six and seven, or about half an hour\r\n     after six in the morning, 1646.” Another entry records a fact not\r\n     often remembered: “My son John was born on Sunday, March 16, at\r\n     half-past nine at night, 1650.” This child, Milton’s only son, died\r\n     an infant--“through the ill-usage or bad constitution of an\r\n     ill-chosen nurse,” says Phillips. The fates and fortunes of\r\n     Milton’s remaining children, and even of his grandchildren, are\r\n     well-known; we read also of great-grandchildren who lived, but (it\r\n     is to be feared) did not flourish, at Madras down to the\r\n     commencement of George II.’s reign. Then one loses sight of them\r\n     altogether. Possibly the heir of the poet’s body is a Eurasian, and\r\n     a writer of Baboo English. Perhaps he is identical with the\r\n     judicious author who boasted that “he had studied the Shakespeare\r\n     and the Milton, and had avoided the imperfections of either.”--_St.\r\n     James’s Gazette._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _A Guide to the Roman Villa recently discovered at Morton, between\r\n     Sandown and Brading, Isle of Wight._ By JOHN E. PRICE, F.S.A., and\r\n     F. G. HILTON PRICE, F.G.S. Ventnor: Briddon Brothers, 1884.\r\n\r\nFROM time to time during the past century, excavations made\r\nintentionally or unintentionally, have revealed to modern eyes how large\r\na store of remains still attest the presence of the Eagles of Imperial\r\nRome in this country, though fifteen or sixteen centuries have passed\r\nsince their departure from these shores. At Woodchester, on the\r\nGloucestershire Hills; at Chesters near Hexham, on the Roman Wall; at\r\nBignor near Petworth, on the Sussex Downs; at Carleon-upon-Usk in\r\nMonmouthshire; in north, south, and central London, at Colchester, at\r\nLincoln, and in a dozen other places, we have seen exhumed from time to\r\ntime, baths, ovens, kitchens, and temples with walls and floors inlaid\r\nwith Roman mosaics, dating from the days of the Antonines and Hadrian.\r\n\r\nBut few of these places are of greater interest than Brading in the Isle\r\nof Wight, near which Messrs. Price brought to light, in 1880, the\r\nground-plan of one Roman villa, almost complete. The explorations\r\noriginated in the discovery of such indications of Roman buildings as\r\noffered encouragement for further investigation. Here a short time\r\npreviously to our authors’ assisting in the matter, Captain Thorp, of\r\nYarbridge, had discovered fragments of walls, roof tiles, and traces of\r\npavements, and had devoted a considerable amount of energy and zeal to\r\nthe complete examination of the ground. Before many months had passed\r\nby, it was found necessary, on account of the number of pilgrims who\r\nflocked thither, to publish a guide, giving a description of the\r\ndiscoveries. This has now reached the honours of an eleventh edition. In\r\nthis Guide the dimensions of the several chambers of which the building\r\nconsisted are duly set forth, and the fragments of pottery, mosaics, and\r\ntessellated pavements fully described and illustrated. By the kindness\r\nof the authors we are enabled to reproduce one of the illustrations,[78]\r\nwhich represents a group in the south-west compartment of the lower\r\nportion of the pavement of one of the larger chambers, admirably worked\r\nin small tesseræ of varied colours. There is a female figure partially\r\ndraped after the manner of the _saltatrix_ or dancing girl of Greece or\r\nItaly, playing upon a tambourine; her companion is a male figure of more\r\nthan ordinary interest, on account of the peculiarities presented by the\r\ncostume worn--a Phrygian cap, a skirted tunic with a small cloak or\r\n_pallium_ fastened on the right shoulder, and _braccæ_ or “trousers.”\r\n“The peculiarity of this dress,” writes Messrs. Price, “leads to the\r\nopinion that it may be that in fashion at the time the mosaic was laid\r\ndown, because the form given to the _braccæ_ is different to that\r\nusually met with in the costume attributed to the ‘barbarians’ or\r\nprovincial nations in Roman sculpture.”\r\n\r\n     _The Lincolnshire Survey._ Edited by JAMES GREENSTREET. Privately\r\n     printed. 1884.\r\n\r\nBY the publication of this valuable and handsome volume Mr. Greenstreet\r\nhas done good service to the cause of historical research, and has\r\nearned the gratitude of all those who are lovers of exact scholarship.\r\nThe Lincolnshire Survey enjoys the reputation of being probably the\r\nearliest after Domesday, which had only preceded it by some thirty\r\nyears, and which, in form, it closely resembles. In the autotype plates\r\nby which this ancient survey is here reproduced in fac-simile, the\r\nwriting is as clear almost throughout, as when the parchment first\r\nreceived it 770 years ago. It was fitting that a record which can only\r\nappeal to antiquarian connoisseurs should be issued in the choicest\r\nform, and Mr. Greenstreet’s subscribers have good reason to be satisfied\r\nwith the appearance of the work. The title-page is appropriately adorned\r\nwith the arms of eight of the leading families whose names occur in the\r\nsurvey, grouped round those of the See of Lincoln. Our readers need not\r\nbe reminded of Mr. Greenstreet’s eminence as a herald, possessing as\r\nthey do, in these pages, from his pen, more than one valuable Roll of\r\nArms. We trust that the enterprise he has shown in bringing out this\r\nimportant work may serve to arouse a wider interest in the obscure\r\nperiod with which it deals, and, consequently, in the work of the\r\nPipe-Roll Society, of which Mr. Greenstreet is the honorary secretary,\r\nand one of the most zealous promoters.\r\n\r\n     _Diary and Letters of Thomas Hutchinson, Esq._ By P. O. HUTCHINSON,\r\n     Sampson Low & Co.\r\n\r\nTHIS is the title of a work which will be found to fill an important\r\nblank in the history of the American Revolution. It is the work of one\r\nof Governor Hutchinson’s great-grandsons. It supplies many personal\r\nmemoranda of the leaders on both sides in that struggle, including\r\nseveral notices of the Copleys, Pepperells, and other Royalists, who\r\nsettled in England when the breach between the old country and her\r\ncolonies was complete. There is from first to last about it no attempt\r\nat fine or sensational writing, or at “stating the case” on behalf of\r\nthe Royalist cause; it consists of plain matters of fact, extracts from\r\ndiaries, letters, &c., and these are such as give the reader the\r\nclearest insight into the transactions which it records, and the conduct\r\nof the chief movers in them. As a painstaking effort to place on\r\npermanent record a portion of history of which but little is known, and\r\nwhich as yet has found no adequate historian, the book is deserving of\r\nall praise.\r\n\r\n     _The Principles of Gothic Ecclesiastical Architecture._ By M. H.\r\n     BLOXAM. Three vols. G. Bell & Sons.\r\n\r\nIT is not to be wondered at, considering the part which the veteran Mr.\r\nBloxam has played in the revival of the study of Gothic architecture,\r\nthat this book should have reached its eleventh edition, or that from a\r\nsmall 12mo. volume, couched in a catechetical form, it should have\r\nattained the honour of a library edition--for that is what is now the\r\ncase. Along with the late Mr. J. H. Parker, of Oxford, Mr. Bloxam was\r\none of the chief pioneers of that movement which has found its outcome\r\nin the many flourishing county and diocesan architectural and\r\narchæological societies which are scattered up and down England, and in\r\nthose pleasant annual congresses which Mr. Bloxam himself attended and\r\ninstructed till the weight of eighty years forced him to abandon them.\r\nMost of the older men of the present generation can say that it was from\r\nMr. Bloxam’s little work that they imbibed their earliest taste in the\r\nabove direction, and they will be not the less glad to possess the three\r\nvolumes into which that work has been gradually expanded on account of\r\nthe portrait of its author prefixed to it. The treatise really is one\r\nwhich needs no recommendation at our hands; but it is as well to add\r\nthat the third volume is devoted to an account of the costumes of\r\nmonumental effigies--a branch of the subject to which Mr. Bloxam of late\r\nyears has paid especial attention. The illustrations are exquisitely\r\ndone; and three good indexes add a special value to the work as a book\r\nof reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObituary Memoirs.\r\n\r\n“Emori nolo; sed me esse mortuum nihil æstimo.”--_Epicharmus._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Rev. Hugh Pigot, Rector of Stretham, Cambridgeshire, and author of\r\n“The History of Hadleigh,” died on September 22, aged sixty-five years.\r\nMr. Pigot graduated at Brasenose College, Oxford, and besides the\r\nabove-mentioned work, he was the author of “A Guide to the Town of\r\nHadleigh,” “Suffolk Superstitions,” and other antiquarian works.\r\n\r\nTHE Rev. John Allen Giles, D.C.L., Rector of Sutton, Surrey, formerly\r\nheadmaster of Camberwell Collegiate School, and afterwards of the City\r\nof London School, died on September 24. His name is known as a scholar\r\nin various branches of learning. He edited or translated the works of\r\nLanfranc and of the Venerable Bede, “Letters of St. Thomas of\r\nCanterbury,” the “Codex Apocryphus Novi Testamenti,” “Sculptores Græci\r\nMinores,” “Terentii Comœdiæ,” “Severi Sancti Carmen,” and “The Works\r\nof King Alfred the Great.” He was also the author of the “Life and Times\r\nof Alfred the Great,” “Life and Letters of Thomas à Becket,” “The\r\nHistory of Bampton,” “The History of Witney,” and a “History of the\r\nAncient Britons,” &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: text decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeetings of Learned Societies.\r\n\r\nMETROPOLITAN.\r\n\r\nBRITISH ARCHÆOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION.\r\n\r\n(_Continued from p. 195._)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Council of the Archæological Association added this year three\r\n“extra days” to their Tenby congress, to be devoted to Haverfordwest and\r\nSt. David’s. Accordingly on Tuesday, September 9, they went to Narberth,\r\nto visit the castle of that town. This was made the subject of comment\r\nby Mr. Loftus Brock, who explained its leading features, drawing\r\nattention to its strong position and its great extent, and stating a few\r\nfacts about its history, from which it appeared that it was founded by a\r\nNorman baron named Perrott, and passed by royal gift into the hands of\r\nSir Rees or Rhys Ap Thomas, who was its owner in the days of Leland; and\r\nthe latter mentions it in his “Itinerary” as a “praty” place. Like the\r\nother castles of this country, it suffered sadly during the civil wars,\r\nand though afterwards repaired and inhabited, it soon fell again into\r\ndecay. From Narberth their journey lay to Llawwhydden, a castellated\r\nmansion of the Bishops of St. David’s, who here figured almost as\r\nbarons, and lived in baronial splendour. Of this once noble structure\r\nonly some octagonal towers remain, and these and some fine lancet\r\nwindows were much admired. The next visit was to Picton Castle, a place\r\nwhich has never ceased to be inhabited, and which, therefore, shows more\r\ncompletely than any other similar structure in Pembrokeshire what was\r\nthe condition of a feudal castle four or five centuries ago. It was\r\nbuilt by a Norman knight named William de Picton, in the reign of\r\nWilliam Rufus. The building is oblong in plan, with three large bastions\r\nprojecting on each side, and at the eastern end, between two smaller\r\nbastions, was the principal gateway with a double portcullis. Until a\r\ncomparatively recent period it retained its original form, and even the\r\nalterations made by the late Lord Milford and his predecessors have not\r\nmuch affected or changed its original character as a baronial fortress,\r\ncastellated and embattled. The castle itself and its historical\r\nassociations were explained by the present owner, Mr. Charles Philipps,\r\nwho entertained the whole party present at luncheon. It was late in the\r\nafternoon when the party drove on to Haverfordwest, where they explored\r\nthe noble castle, which frowns down upon the town, the river, and its\r\nbridges, but which is far more interesting externally than internally,\r\nas its four square walls are really almost a shell, such buildings as\r\nthere were inside of them having been long since removed in order to\r\nutilise it as a prison, a purpose which it has served until very lately.\r\nIt is now empty and vacant, and has been made the property of the town,\r\nwho keep it in repair. They also inspected St. Mary’s Church, one of the\r\nvery finest ecclesiastical structures in South Wales, and remarkable as\r\nhaving nearly the only clerestory (except that of St. David’s Cathedral)\r\nto be found within the whole county. Here the archæologists found very\r\nmuch to admire in the Early English arches of the nave and church, the\r\nrecumbent monument of a knight near the porch door, the elegantly carved\r\nroofs, and the graceful arcading and capitals of the pillars throughout.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the archæologists were favoured with very fine weather for\r\ntheir drive to St. David’s. It is observed of this sixteen-mile journey\r\nthat it has as many hills as miles. Leland writes: “This tract was\r\ninhabited by the Flemings out of the Low Countries, who by permission of\r\nKing Henry I. were planted here. These are distinctly known still from\r\nthe Welsh, and so near joined are they in society of the same language\r\nwith Englishmen, who come nighest of any nation to the Low Dutch tongue,\r\nthat this their country is called by the Britons, ‘Little England beyond\r\nWales.’” On their way to St. David’s the carriages halted at Roche\r\nCastle, a fine old fortress, of which little now remains except a single\r\ntower, which forms a conspicuous landmark. Its site was evidently chosen\r\nfor its strength. It was built early in the thirteenth century by one\r\nAdam de Roche or de Rocke, who founded here one of the most powerful of\r\nNorman families. The name, it may be interesting to know, still remains\r\nin Pembrokeshire. The castle was to a great extent ruined in the wars\r\nagainst the Welsh, and what remained became still further dilapidated\r\nthrough the rough treatment which it received from the soldiers of the\r\nParliament when it was held by its captain, Francis Edwards, on behalf\r\nof King Charles I. Roche Castle was briefly commented upon by Mr. Loftus\r\nBrock. From this point the party proceeded by way of Newgall Sands, and\r\nthe tumulus which is still called Poyntz Castle, to Solva, and so on to\r\nSt. David’s, where they arrived in time to partake of the Bishop’s\r\nhospitality at a luncheon, which they found ready spread for them in the\r\ngrounds of the ruined episcopal palace of Bishop Gower. Luncheon over,\r\nthe Bishop proposed “The Health of the Queen,” and then in a brief\r\nspeech welcomed the archæologists to this the first banquet given by a\r\nbishop in these grounds for many centuries; after which he explained the\r\npeculiarities of the structure, which, he said, is really a double\r\npalace, joined in the ground-plan into a sort of letter “L” by a common\r\nkitchen at the angle. He then enlarged upon the great beauties of the\r\narcade which runs all round the palace above, the curious structure of\r\nits once magnificent roof, now destroyed, its exquisite “wheel” or\r\n“rose” window, its chapel, and its grand dining-hall; the whole forming\r\ntogether by far the finest specimen of domestic architecture in South\r\nWales, or, perhaps, in the entire principality. It is needless to say\r\nthat this matchless structure was very much admired. At four o’clock the\r\nentire party, nearly one hundred strong, attended service in the\r\ncathedral, after which the Dean took them in hand, and conducted them\r\nround the building, explaining every part in detail, and showing the\r\nextent to which the restorations of the last quarter of a century had\r\naltered and improved its condition. He pointed out the semi-Norman\r\narches of the nave, purified from coats of whitewash, the roof cleaned,\r\nthe side aisles repaved, and the windows restored. Then he led them into\r\nthe south transept, which not long since was little better than a barn,\r\nand assigned as the place for a Welsh service, to which a new roof and\r\nnew windows had been added by benefactors now deceased. He then took\r\nthem through a series of ruined side chapels to the Lady-chapel, now\r\nbare and roofless, though full of the purest architectural details.\r\nThence the party were conducted to Bishop Vaughan’s chapel, behind the\r\nhigh altar, rich with a roof of fan tracery, which is scarcely to be\r\nmatched except at King’s College Chapel, Cambridge. He also pointed out\r\nthe front and the back of the marble slab on which rested the shrine of\r\nSt. David, once an object of pilgrimage inferior in interest and in the\r\nnumber of its devotees only to that of St. Thomas of Canterbury,\r\nreminding them that in the old days two pilgrimages to St. David’s were\r\nalways regarded, in canonical penance, as equivalent to one journey to\r\nRome--according to the old monkish rhyme, “Roma semel quantum bis dat\r\nMenevia tantum.” The Dean next showed the progress of the works in the\r\nnorth transept, and then led the party into the cathedral vestry or\r\nchapter-house, formerly St. Thomas’s Chapel, where he showed them a\r\nsmall collection of ecclesiastical relics, including the tops of two\r\nepiscopal croziers, the top of a processional cross, two episcopal\r\nrings, and some chalices which had been buried along with some of the\r\nolder bishops. He also displayed here the cathedral plate, the communion\r\nservice, platen, and chalice, on which Messrs. Lambert and Loftus Brock\r\noffered some descriptive remarks. The Dean having completed his\r\nperegrinations and description of the fabric, a vote of thanks to him\r\nfor his kindness was proposed by Mr. Thomas Morgan, F.S.A, and seconded\r\nby Mr. E. Walford, M.A., who, in a few words, contrasted the present\r\nstate of the cathedral, after its recent repairs, with its new roofs,\r\ndecorated interior, and rebuilt west front, with what he remembered of\r\nit forty years ago, when it was little more than a large barn-like\r\nstructure, covered with a mixture of whitewash and whitey-brown paint\r\nfrom end to end; he also congratulated the Dean and Chapter on the\r\nconservative way in which the work of restoration had been carried out.\r\nIn the evening the Dean entertained at dinner at his house, in the\r\nClose, the leading members of the congress, whom he kindly invited to\r\nmeet the Bishop.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the congress and its members the fine weather which they\r\nhad enjoyed upon the whole continued to the last. Although carriages\r\ncannot be driven up actually to St. David’s Head, the extreme object of\r\ntheir pilgrimage, yet they were enabled to draw up about a mile short of\r\nit, and Mr. Edward Laws acted as their guide over the rest of the way on\r\nfoot. Arrived at the Head, they saw a magnificent seaview, and rocks\r\nsuch as not to be found elsewhere except at the Land’s End in Cornwall.\r\nMr. Laws explained to them the remains of a large stone circle, not\r\nunlike those at Stonehenge and Avebury, in Wiltshire, with portions of\r\nits avenue of large stones still remaining _in situ_. They were also\r\nable to see the traces of a fine fortification, probably British, close\r\nby St. Justinian’s Chapel. A ruined edifice near the sea-shore was also\r\ninspected, and Mr. Laws pointed out to the party the place where local\r\ntradition declares that the old Roman city of Menevia lies buried many\r\nfeet deep below the sand-drifts. Before returning to St. David’s, they\r\nwere also shown the traces of a quadrangular fort, probably Roman,\r\nnearer to the city. The return to Haverfordwest was effected in good\r\ntime. This enabled the members to inspect portions of the old castle,\r\nthe council chamber, the churches of St. Mary and St. Martin, and a\r\nvariety of private houses in which vaulted cellars, carved and painted\r\nmantelpieces, and the tracery of mediæval windows still exist, and also\r\nto extend their walk to the ruins of the Priory in the riverside fields\r\nbelow the bridge over the Cleddaw. Here, under the guidance of Colonel\r\nBramble, they were able to make out the ground-plan of this once noble\r\necclesiastical structure, including its cruciform church, the refectory,\r\ncloister, &c. The party then returned to the Castle Hotel, and the\r\ncongress finally broke up, much to the regret of its members, who agreed\r\nthat it had been one of the pleasantest and most successful of such\r\nannual gatherings. This result was largely due, it should be added, to\r\nthe courtesy of the authorities of the Great Western and the Pembroke\r\nand Tenby Railway Companies, whose officials lent them all the aid in\r\ntheir power.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION.--The annual meeting of the above Association\r\nwas held at Trinity College, Dublin, Dr. Ingram, F.T.C.D., Librarian of\r\nthe College, presiding. The proceedings commenced on Tuesday, September\r\n30, and among those present were Mr. Justice O’Hagan, the Lord Mayor,\r\nM.P., Lord Charles Bruce, the Provost of Trinity College, Dublin; Rev.\r\nDr. Haughton, F.T.C.D, F.R.S.; Dr. Moffat, President of Queen’s College,\r\nGalway; Mr. George Bullen, of the British Museum, and others. Dr. Ingram\r\nhaving offered the Association a hearty welcome, gave an account of the\r\nlibrary in Trinity College. It was well stored with ancient and modern\r\nliterature, containing more than 200,000 volumes of printed books, and\r\nabout 2,000 manuscripts. It contained certain peculiar and precious\r\nthings, some of them deserving to be called national heirlooms, which\r\ngave to it a special character and dignity of its own. Trinity College\r\nhaving been founded in 1591, was opened for the admission of students on\r\nJanuary 9, 1594. He explained the difficulties under which the library\r\nwas formed, and gave an account of its contents, which had outgrown the\r\naccommodation provided for them. The first group of manuscripts worthy\r\nof notice consisted of three Biblical manuscripts, which possessed\r\nspecial interest. The first was the palimpsest known as “Codex\r\nrescriptus Dublinensis,” in which an uncial text of portions of St.\r\nMatthew’s Gospel had been partially covered with more recent writings,\r\ncontaining extracts from ecclesiastical authors. Dr. Barrett, a Fellow\r\nof the College, who discovered and edited the palimpsest, assigned it to\r\nthe sixth century at latest, having believed it to be of the fifth. In\r\nthe same volume were also palimpsest fragments of Isaiah, probably of an\r\nearlier date than the text of St. Matthew. The second Greek text in\r\ntheir possession was the “Codex Montfortianus,” a late manuscript and of\r\nlittle critical value. The third text was in cursive characters, with a\r\ncommentary of the tenth century. There was formerly a fourth Greek text\r\nof the New Testament, but it was lost between the years 1688 and 1742,\r\nand after several changes of ownership is now in the library of the\r\nMarquis of Bute. The library contained several copies executed in\r\nIreland of the Gospels in Latin, according to the Vulgate version. Among\r\nthem the place of honour belonged to the world-renowned Book of Kells.\r\nThe marvellous illuminations give the volume its great interest, being\r\nthoroughly Irish in their type, the characteristic spiral ornamentation\r\nconstantly recurring. The manuscript is of the seventh or eighth\r\ncentury. It was preserved in the Columbian Monastery of Kells, in Meath,\r\nwhence its name was derived, and came to Trinity College in the Ussher\r\nLibrary. The library also contained the Book of Durrow. Other Irish\r\ncopies of the Vulgate version of the Four Gospels are the Book of Dimma\r\nand the Book of Moling, both probably of the seventh century. These\r\nmanuscripts are in silver cases, ornamented with crystals. That of the\r\nBook of Dimma states that the case was gilt by O’Carroll, Lord of Ely,\r\nin the twelfth century. It also boasts the Book of Armagh, compiled\r\nabout A.D. 750, with the celebrated confession of the Saint, and\r\ndocuments on the rights of the See of Armagh. Coming to English\r\ntypography, they could boast only a single Caxton. It is a copy of the\r\nsecond edition of the Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers, printed\r\nabout 1480, though not the first printed in English. On the motion of\r\nthe Lord Mayor, seconded by the Provost, and supported by Mr. Bullen, a\r\nvote of thanks was passed to Dr. Ingram for his address. The report of\r\nthe Association was taken as read. Mr. George Bullen, Keeper of the\r\nPrinted Books, British Museum, then read a paper entitled “Early Notices\r\nof Guttenburg.” He held that it had not been conclusively proved that\r\nGuttenberg was the inventor of the art of printing. After a few remarks\r\nfrom Dr. Garnett, Mr. Bullen mentioned that in Japan and China the art\r\nof printing from moveable type was known long before it was known in\r\nEurope. Some books had been brought from Japan which were printed in the\r\nyear 1417. They were now in the British Museum. Mr. Harrison (London)\r\nsaid the irony of fate was shown in the fact that Ticket, who writes of\r\nthe art of printing as perpetuating the memory of man, did not get his\r\nown letter made public until 400 years after it was written.\r\nSubsequently the members visited the library of Trinity College, and the\r\nRecord Office, Four-courts.--The business of Wednesday began with the\r\nadoption of a report on the proposed examination of library assistants\r\nin the month of September next. Certificates will be awarded to\r\nsuccessful candidates according to their various degrees of merit. Mr.\r\nDix Hutton read a paper entitled “Impressions of Twelve Years’\r\nCataloguing in a Great Library” (that of Trinity College, Dublin), which\r\nwas listened to with marked attention. It was not ended when the arrival\r\nof the Lord-Lieutenant was announced. After Mr. Hutton came Lord Charles\r\nBruce, who read an epitome of the history of his relative’s renowned\r\nlibrary at Althorp, and described some of the rarer specimens of its\r\ncontents. Lord Spencer admitted that Lord Charles had told him much\r\nwhich he had not known before. His Excellency concluded his speech with\r\na frank and hearty invitation to the public, and especially to those\r\npresent, to make use of the stores of his library. A pleasant interlude\r\nfollowed in the shape of “Twenty Years’ Recollections of Panizzi,” by\r\nMr. Henry Stevens, of Vermont, which was “capped” by amusing\r\nrecollections of Panizzi by the Rev. Dr. Haughton.--On Thursday Dr.\r\nGarnett, of the British Museum, read a paper “On the Use of Photography\r\nin Libraries,” in which he advocated the establishment of a\r\nphotographing department in the British Museum at the cost of the State.\r\nThe cost of photographing, if the work were left in private hands,\r\nmust, he thought, be far more expensive than if it were done by a public\r\ninstitution, inasmuch as under the latter condition the main elements of\r\nexpense, that of photographers’ personal charges and the cost of\r\nmaterial, would entirely disappear. At present these charges were\r\nsufficient to seriously impede the British Museum in its earnest desire\r\nto circulate its treasures by means of photography, while to private\r\npersons they were, in general, absolutely prohibitive. The recent case\r\nof the transfer of the Irish portion of the Ashburnham manuscripts to\r\nDublin was a case in point. Whether placed in Dublin or in London they\r\nmust be equally inaccessible to a large number of scholars, but if a\r\nnational institution had existed in which _fac-similes_ could be made of\r\nthe national property free of expense, it would be indifferent where the\r\noriginals were deposited. By a further application of the same principle\r\nIreland might have _fac-similes_ of every manuscript illustrative of her\r\nancient language or literature within her own shores, and _vice versâ_.\r\nPhotography as a public institution would be beneficial not merely to\r\nindividual customers, but to the community at large, for it afforded the\r\nbest means of meeting the legitimate demands of provincial institutions\r\nand museums. Provincial residents contributing out of the taxes to the\r\nsupport of the British Museum and similar institutions had a right to\r\nexpect that their stores should be made as accessible as possible. To\r\nmeet this wish by cheapening photographic reproductions would be not to\r\ncreate a luxury, but to redress a grievance. Dr. Garnett gave numerous\r\ninstances within his own knowledge of the expense and inconvenience\r\noccasioned by the absence of facilities for photographing literary and\r\nartistic objects. Such an institution as that suggested should be\r\nlocated at the British Museum. Its management would require much\r\nprudence to avoid undue competition with private photographers, and to\r\nmake some pecuniary return to the State without defeating its own object\r\nby high prices. If successful, it might form the germ of undertakings of\r\nthe highest national, and even international, importance. The vexed\r\nquestion of the custody of parish registers would be solved by\r\nphotography, and if other nations combined, each might possess within\r\nits own borders the materials for its own history now scattered through\r\nevery country in Europe. The President considered the paper one of the\r\nmost important yet placed before the meeting. The Royal Irish Academy\r\nhad undertaken to transcribe some of the most important Celtic\r\nmanuscripts, and then have them lithographed. To do this the services of\r\nan old Irish scholar, Mr. O’Longan, were obtained. He was a genuine\r\nIrish scholar, and he transcribed the “Leabhar-na-Huidhre,” “Leabhar\r\nBreao,” and “The Book of Leinster.” Having transcribed these, with the\r\nassistance of Professor O’Loony, of the Catholic University, the works\r\nwere lithographed. Mr. O’Longan commenced the fourth book--“The Book of\r\nBallymote,” but he died before it was transcribed, and the work was\r\nbrought to a termination. Mr. O’Longan had most conscientiously\r\nperformed his duty, and this was borne testimony to by Dr. Atkinson, who\r\nwas at present having some important records photographed. Professor\r\nHennessy thought that the works carried out in the Royal Irish Academy,\r\nand referred to by the President, were not correct productions of the\r\noriginals. He hoped that if the “Book of Ballymote” was to be copied it\r\nwould be reproduced by photography. Visits were paid to the National\r\nLibrary, the Royal Irish Academy, and to Marsh’s Library. This consists\r\nof three libraries, Dr. Stillingfleet’s, Archbishop Marsh’s, and Bishop\r\nStearne’s, besides a collection of foreign books. One of the curiosities\r\nof the collection is a copy of Clarendon’s “History,” annotated by Dean\r\nSwift. This last day of the meeting was filled up mainly with routine\r\nbusiness, modification of rules, election of officers, and votes of\r\nthanks: Mr. Tedder, however, reading his instructive paper “On the Study\r\nof Bibliography,” and the Rev. W. D. Macray another “On the Libraries of\r\nSouth Australia,” written by Mr. C. Holgate. There was also a desultory\r\nconversation on free libraries. It was agreed that the next annual\r\nmeeting should be held at Plymouth. A reception of the members of the\r\nAssociation by the Provost of Trinity College and Mrs. Jellett brought\r\nthe meeting to a close.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVINCIAL.\r\n\r\nHAILEYBURY COLLEGE ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY, _July 1_.--Mr. E. Walford read a\r\npaper on “Old Watering Places.” Beginning with some remarks on watering\r\nplaces in general, and the amusements resorted to by those who visited\r\nthem, he first spoke of Bath, the oldest watering place in England.\r\nThere are many old Roman remains here, but the walls and gates of the\r\ncity, which were of the portentous length of 400 yards by 380 yards,\r\nhave long ago disappeared. Of the ancient history of Bath little is\r\nknown. It formed at one time the quarters of the Sixth legion. The town\r\nwas laid waste by the Saxons in the seventh century, and, after being\r\ntaken and retaken by Saxons and Danes, was in the eighth century taken\r\nby Offa, King of Mercia, from the Prince of Wessex. The town was\r\ndestroyed by fire in A.D. 1137. The most interesting part of the history\r\nof modern Bath is the period of Beau Nash’s reign, who, despite his\r\nprofligacy, became very popular at Bath, where he was elected “king;”\r\nand it was during his reign that Bath reached the height of its\r\nprosperity. He died in 1761, and received a public funeral. Mr. Walford\r\nalso explained the extent and interest of recent excavations at Bath.\r\nThe next place spoken of was Brighton. The old name of this town was\r\nBrighthelmstone, probably derived from an old word “Brit,” signifying\r\n“divided,” as the town was in former times divided by a narrow brook\r\nflowing through it. It was bounded by three streets, North-street,\r\nEast-street, and West-street, outside of which were five large tracts of\r\nland, known as the Tenantry “Laines,” a word probably connected with\r\n“lay,” and signifying, as shown by Mr. F. Sawyer, the “laying-out” or\r\ndisposing of the land. An old map of Brighton, which was passed round,\r\nserved to illustrate the lecturer’s remarks. The town was originally\r\nbuilt under the cliff, but in 1703 a storm occurred, which, followed by\r\nanother in 1705, completely destroyed the old town. Mr. Walford promised\r\nto give a lecture, on a future occasion, upon Hythe, Seaford, and the\r\nother Cinque Ports.\r\n\r\nROYAL HISTORICAL AND ARCHÆOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF IRELAND.--The Ulster\r\nquarterly meeting of this body was held on Aug. 7, at Armagh, Lord\r\nCharlemont in the chair. The minutes of the last meeting, held at\r\nKillarney, having been read by the hon. secretary, the Rev. J. Graves,\r\nand several new members elected, Mr. J. P. Prendergast,\r\nbarrister-at-law, read a paper on “Charlemont Fort,” a place intimately\r\nconnected with Lord Charlemont’s family. Mr. W. F. Wakeman read a paper\r\n“On Some Recent Discoveries at Lisnacrogher, near Broughshane, County\r\nAntrim.” Two interesting papers were read by Mr. J. J. Phillips,\r\nBelfast. The first was, “Notes on some old Wrought-iron Grille Work in\r\nthe Vicinity of Armagh;” the second, on “The Ancient Abbey of Armagh.”\r\nRev. G. R. Buick, M.A., read a paper on “An Earthenware Vessel found on\r\na Pre-Historic Site at Port Stuart.” A visit was afterwards paid to the\r\nlibrary and the ruins of the Franciscan Abbey in the Palace grounds at\r\nArmagh, which had been kindly thrown open by his Grace the Lord Primate.\r\nOn the following day the members and friends visited a number of\r\nhistoric sites in the neighbourhood. They assembled at 10 o’clock, and\r\ndrove in brakes to the site of the ancient lime-kiln at Emania. This\r\nlime-kiln is mentioned in the “Four Masters,” and is said to have been\r\nerected by Gillamacliag, successor of Patrick. The great earthwork now\r\ncalled Emania was the chief regal seat of the Irians, which was the\r\ngeneric name borne by the inhabitants of the province of Ulster. This\r\nwas the resort of the renowned knights of Craebh Ruadh, or Royal Branch,\r\nand the palace of the Kings of Ulster for upwards of seven hundred\r\nyears, until finally destroyed by the three Collas. The excursionists\r\nnext visited the King’s Stables and Ballybrawly Stone Circle, and then\r\nproceeded to Tynan Abbey, the residence of Sir James Stronge, where the\r\nbeautiful crosses and grounds were inspected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: text decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIQUARIAN NEWS & NOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next annual meeting of the Kent Archæological Society will be held\r\nat Sandwich.\r\n\r\nLORD DUCIE contradicts the report that he “is collecting materials for a\r\nhistory of the Spanish Armada of 1588.”\r\n\r\nA COLLECTION of old Wedgwood ware has been lent by Mr. Felix Joseph for\r\nexhibition at the museum in Nottingham Castle.\r\n\r\nLORD TENNYSON’S new poem will be entitled “St. Thomas à Becket: a\r\nDrama.” The play, it is stated, is “not intended for acting.”\r\n\r\nOUR December number will contain an article by the Editor on Dr.\r\nJohnson, with reference to the 100th anniversary of his death.\r\n\r\nSIR P. CUNLIFFE OWEN purposes to raise in America a sufficient sum of\r\nmoney to “restore” the parish church of Stratford-on-Avon from end to\r\nend.\r\n\r\nTHE Duke of Norfolk, as we learn from the _Weekly Register_, has visited\r\nHolywell, where the little Earl of Arundel was bathed in the waters of\r\nSt. Winifrede’s Well.\r\n\r\n“TREE GOSSIP,” a little volume on the byways of tree lore, by Mr.\r\nFrancis George Heath, will be published shortly by Messrs. Field & Tuer,\r\nat the Leadenhall Press.\r\n\r\nTHE memorial of the liberation of Vienna in 1683 in the Cathedral of St.\r\nStephen’s, on which the sculptor, Herr Hellmer, is engaged, will, it is\r\nexpected, be completed by Christmas.\r\n\r\nTHE monument which is to commemorate the landing of St. Augustine in the\r\nIsle of Thanet, is being erected by Lord Granville himself, and not by\r\nthe English Catholics, as stated by the _Journal de Rome_.\r\n\r\nTHE number of historic documents in the possession of the corporation of\r\nHull, which is very large, and of great antiquarian interest, is to be\r\nset in order and calendared by Mr. T. T. Wildridge.\r\n\r\nTHE Rev. F. W. Weaver announces as nearly ready his “Visitations of\r\nSomerset in 1531 and 1573.” The work will be published, by subscription,\r\nby Mr. Wm. Pollard, of North-street, Exeter.\r\n\r\nIT is stated that the two portrait pictures of the second wife of Rubens\r\nfrom the Blenheim collection were purchased by a member of the\r\nRothschild family. They will go to the Continent.\r\n\r\nTHE Royal Castle of Christianborg, Copenhagen, has been burnt down, and\r\nseveral important works of art, including some by Thorwaldsen, as well\r\nas the archives of the Rigsdag, have been destroyed. The castle chapel\r\nand Thorwaldsen Museum have been saved.\r\n\r\nTHE Clarendon Press is about to publish a volume of York Mystery Plays,\r\nprinted for the first time from a MS. in the Ashburnham collection. The\r\nbook, which will contain notes and a glossary, is edited by Mr. Toulmin\r\nSmith.\r\n\r\nTHE Emperor of Austria has presented to the Royal Library at Vienna a\r\ncollection of ancient Arabic literature, comprising 1,600 works in 1,052\r\nvolumes. The oldest of these MSS. dates from 1058 A.D., or earlier, and\r\nis called the “Kitab Elfelahe,” or book of agriculture.\r\n\r\nTHE new apse of the Basilica of St. John Lateran at Rome and the\r\nprolongation of the portico of Sixtus IV. are approaching completion;\r\nand the decorations of the Hall of the Candelabra in the Vatican\r\nsculpture gallery are finished.\r\n\r\nMESSRS. WARD, LOCK & CO., are on the point of publishing an exhaustive\r\ntreatise on the Violin, by Mr. Ed. Heron-Allen, author of “The Ancestry\r\nof the Violin,” “Violin-making, as it was, and is,” &c. The work will be\r\nprofusely illustrated.\r\n\r\nA “HISTORY of England under Henry IV.,” by Mr. James Hamilton Wylie,\r\nInspector of Schools, will shortly be published by Messrs. Longmans; and\r\n“A Study of Anne Boleyn,” by Herr Paul Friedmann, is announced for\r\npublication by Messrs. Macmillan.\r\n\r\nDR. HUMANN has been appointed Abtheilungs-Director at the Royal Museum\r\nin Berlin, which he has done so much to enrich. The excavator of\r\nPergamus is working at Nemruddagh, and his official position has no\r\nconditions of residence attached to it.\r\n\r\nTHE front of the Curfew Tower, the most ancient portion of Windsor\r\nCastle, is being refaced with the “Neath stone.” The new masonry is\r\nbeing carefully built up under the supervision of Mr. R. Howe, Clerk of\r\nthe Works at the Castle.\r\n\r\nTHE literary property in letters--that is, the right to publish copies\r\nof them--remains in all cases in the writer. This was decided as long\r\nago as 1741, in “Pope _v._ Curll, 2 Atk. 342,” when the poet obtained at\r\nthe hands of Lord Hardwick an injunction against the publisher who\r\nproposed to print some of Pope’s letters.--_Law Times._\r\n\r\nTHE bicentenary of Corneille was celebrated with great _éclat_ on\r\nSaturday, October 11, by the town of Rouen, where he was born in 1606,\r\nand died in 1684. The Academy was represented on the occasion by MM.\r\nDumas and Sully-Prudhomme, the former of whom delivered an oration in\r\nhonour of the dramatist and poet.\r\n\r\nA CALL has just been made for the purpose of forming an American\r\nHistorical Association to deal with both the story of the past and with\r\nthat of the immediate present. Professor C. K. Adams, of Michigan,\r\nProfessor M. C. Tyler, of Cornell, and Professor Adams, of Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversities, are the chief movers in the matter.\r\n\r\nTHE Clarendon Press will publish in November a work entitled “The\r\nAncient Coptic Churches of Egypt,” by Mr. A. J. Butler, Fellow of\r\nBrasenose College. The work will consist of two octavo volumes, the\r\nfirst being mainly architectural, the second dealing with church\r\nfurniture, vestments, rites, and ceremonies. It will contain numerous\r\nplans and illustrations.\r\n\r\nBY the generosity of three of the subscribers, copies of Mr.\r\nGreenstreet’s autotype fac-simile of the Lincolnshire Survey, temp.\r\nHenry I., have been deposited in the Public Free Libraries at\r\nBirmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham, and Sheffield, and\r\nin the Advocate’s Library, Edinburgh, the Mitchell Library, Glasgow, and\r\nthe National Library of Ireland, Dublin.\r\n\r\nEARLY next year Mr. Quaritch will issue to subscribers Messrs. Herbert\r\nJones’ work, entitled “The Princess Charlotte of Wales,” an illustrated\r\nmonograph, which will contain reproductions in monochrome of a series of\r\nminiatures of the Princess from her cradle to her grave, painted from\r\nlife by Charlotte Jones. The book will also comprise a memoir of the\r\nPrincess, and selections from her correspondence. The edition will be\r\nlimited to 250 copies.\r\n\r\nTHREE pictures which are claimed to be works of J. W. M. Turner, have\r\nbeen brought to light at Exeter. They represent views of the interior of\r\nExeter Cathedral, and have been stowed away for nearly fifty years as\r\nlumber. An Exeter hairdresser lately purchased the pictures from a\r\nfurniture broker for a sovereign each. A judge of works of art has\r\noffered £1,500 for the three, but the owner has communicated with London\r\nexperts, so as to place the authorship of the works beyond question.\r\n\r\nTHE following articles, more or less of an antiquarian character, appear\r\namong the contents of the magazines for October:--_Contemporary Review_,\r\n“Goethe;” _Art Journal_, “Landscapes in London: The Inns of Court,” “The\r\nFountaine Collection,” and “Delft Ware;” _Century Magazine_, “The\r\n‘Odyssey’ and its Epoch;” _Gentleman’s Magazine_, “A French Curé in the\r\nSixteenth Century;” _Harpers Magazine_, “The Great Hall of William\r\nRufus;” _Le Livre_, “Canterbury, its Cathedral, its Library,” &c.\r\n\r\nWITH a view to perpetuating the memory of the French Walloon refugees\r\nwho settled in Canterbury three centuries ago, the directors of the\r\nFrench Protestant Hospice in London have commissioned a well-known\r\nKentish archæologist to transcribe the inscriptions on the tombstones in\r\nCanterbury and the neighbourhood, where many of the refugees lie buried.\r\nOf the Huguenot and other French exiles who found a home beneath the\r\nshadow of Canterbury Cathedral, and established in its crypt a church\r\nwhich exists to the present day, there are now but few descendants\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nTHE Mercers’ Chapel, Cheapside, has been reopened, after extensive\r\nrepairs and alterations; the latter comprise new flooring, new and very\r\nhandsome carved oak stalls and seats throughout, new choir stalls,\r\nprayer desk and pulpit. The fine old screen has been retained, as also\r\nall the oak panelling round the walls. The organ, one of Father Smith’s,\r\nhas been entirely rebuilt and enlarged. The altar piece is not yet\r\nfinished, but the three large frescoes are in position, the centre and\r\nlargest panel representing the Ascension of our Lord. The whole of the\r\nroof has also been re-decorated, and a sun-light introduced into the\r\nlanthorn.\r\n\r\nTHE second volume of “Topography and Natural History of Lofthouse, near\r\nWakefield,” by Mr. George Roberts, of that place, is in the press. In\r\naddition to the continuation of the “Natural History and Rural Notes,”\r\nit will contain an account of past and present customs, notices of\r\nplaces of worship, further notes on the old Lofthouse families--Hipron,\r\nWatson, and Lyley; a revised list of church sun-dials; and a short\r\nmemoir of Charles Forrest, the discoverer of the Rock sculptures on\r\nRombalds Moor, near Ilkley. The volume will be privately issued to\r\nsubscribers only.\r\n\r\nAT a recent meeting of the Academie des Inscriptions, M. Maspero read a\r\nreport on his archæological work in Egypt during the past year. He\r\ndwells especially upon the new system by which the fellahs are\r\nencouraged to excavate on their own account by the guarantee that they\r\nmay keep for themselves one-half of the objects they find. In this way\r\nthe Boolak Museum has obtained during the past twelvemonths, with no\r\nexpense beyond that of conveyance, about 2,000 objects of various\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nTHE foundation-stone of a new hall for the Butchers’ Company was laid on\r\nSeptember 1, in St. Bartholomew-close; and at the dinner which followed\r\nthe ceremony, the Master, Mr. Ernest Hart, gave some historical details\r\nrelating to the halls of the Company from the reign of Henry II. The\r\nCompany of Butchers, he said, dated as far back as 1180, and had had no\r\nfewer than three halls. The first, in Butcher’s-lane, was destroyed by\r\nfire, as was also the second, in Eastcheap; whilst the third, and last,\r\nhad been demolished in the extension works of the District Railway.\r\n\r\nIN the last days of August was celebrated in the old capital of Flanders\r\nan historical pageant of no ordinary interest. In honour of her patron\r\nand former sovereign, Bruges has placed before the world, in the form of\r\na mediæval procession, the chief incidents in the life of St. Charles\r\nthe Good. The committee of management, which comprised several\r\narchæologists of note, spared no pains to reproduce with the utmost\r\nexactitude the actual dresses and appurtenances of the eleventh and\r\ntwelfth centuries. Many of the highest ladies in the land took part in\r\nthe procession, and wearing the costume of their ancestresses, assumed\r\ntheir parts as ladies in attendance at the Court of their ancient Count.\r\n\r\nFOLLOWING the precedent of the Luther Exhibition held last year at the\r\nBritish Museum, which proved so great an attraction to the building, a\r\nWycliffe Exhibition has been displayed by Mr. E. M. Thompson, keeper of\r\nthe manuscripts, who has also compiled a catalogue descriptive of its\r\ncontents. These consist of a series of manuscripts and printed books,\r\ncomprising translations and service books in English, all intended to\r\nillustrate the efforts made to translate the Bible into English in early\r\ntimes. Then follow Wycliffe’s original works in manuscript and print;\r\nand lastly, the Reformer’s life and actions are illustrated by\r\nmanuscripts and engravings.\r\n\r\nAT Beckhampton, near Avebury, Wilts, a very interesting discovery has\r\nlately been made of an ancient British dwelling pit. The dwelling\r\nconsists of two circular holes, sunk in the clean chalk, adjoining and\r\nintersecting one another. They are about five feet six inches deep, and\r\nfive feet in diameter. On the floor of the pit were found the fragments\r\nof an earthen cooking vessel resting on three stones, and under it the\r\nashes of the fire that had been used in boiling the pot. There were also\r\nfound a well-shaped “spindle-whorle,” a “loom-weight,” bone ornament,\r\nand several so-called “pot boilers,” also bones of the ox, sheep,\r\nrabbit, &c. The whole of the goods and chattels, &c., found in this\r\ninteresting dwelling are now in the County Museum.\r\n\r\nCATALOGUES of rare and curious books, most of which contain the names of\r\nworks of antiquarian interest, have reached us from Mr. F. Edwards, 83,\r\nHigh-street, Marylebone; Mr. U. Maggs, 159, Church-street,\r\nPaddington-green; Mr. G. P. Johnston, 33, George-street, Edinburgh; Mr.\r\nW. Scott, 7, Bristol-place, Edinburgh; Mr. G. Harding, 19, St.\r\nJohn-street, Westminster; Mr. A. B. Osborne, 11, Red Lion-passage,\r\nHolborn; Mr. J. E. Cornish, 33, Piccadilly, Manchester; Messrs. Jarvis &\r\nSon, 28, King William-street, Strand; Messrs. Robson & Kerslake, 43,\r\nCranbourn-street, Leicester-square; Mr. W. Wilkins, Merthyr Tydvil; Mr.\r\nE. Parsons, 45, Brompton-road, S.W.; Messrs. Reeves & Turner, 196,\r\nStrand; Messrs. Farrar & Fenton, 8, John-street, Adelphi.\r\n\r\nA PROPOSAL for the foundation of a museum devoted to the antiquities of\r\nPalestine, has recently been attracting attention in Paris. A room in\r\nthe Louvre is now devoted to the display of objects of this class,\r\nwhich, however, in 1879 did not exceed 83 in number; to these about 100\r\nmore have recently been added, including between 50 and 60 vases and\r\nlamps in terra-cotta. In the British Museum exist between 50 and 60\r\nsimilar objects; and a much larger collection, belonging to the\r\nPalestine Exploration Fund, is partly in possession of that association,\r\neither in London or in Jerusalem, and partly at the South Kensington\r\nMuseum. The whole collection, in these several detachments, does not,\r\nperhaps, exceed 1,000 objects.\r\n\r\nMR. FREDERICK HAWKINS’S “Annals of the French Stage,” which Messrs.\r\nChapman & Hall are to publish in two volumes, extend from its origin to\r\nthe death of Racine. Notwithstanding the light recently thrown in France\r\nupon the development of her old literature, no English writer has\r\nthought fit to illustrate, at least upon anything like a comprehensive\r\nscale, the rise and progress of the theatre in Paris. The author has\r\ntried to verify carefully his statements, and study at first hand the\r\nimportant plays which he has ventured to criticise. For the rest, these\r\nannals, unlike most books relating to the stage, give quite as much\r\nprominence to dramatists and dramatic literature as to players and their\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIN the carrying out of some street repairs at Bonn, a portion of a Roman\r\ndrain or watercourse was lately laid bare at a depth of about 5 ft.\r\nbelow the present surface. It seems to have come from a neighbouring\r\nencampment, is about 20 in. wide, and 30 in. deep, and is constructed\r\nand covered with heavy tufa blocks, well capable of sustaining the wear\r\nof centuries. Many of those blocks were nearly 5 ft. long by 29 in.\r\nthick. An original charter of the German Emperor Henry II., dated 25th\r\nFebruary, 1015, which has long been given up as lost, has just been\r\ndiscovered during an examination of archives of the collegiate church at\r\nBonn, which was formerly attached to a convent of nuns. The charter is\r\non a single sheet of parchment, very well preserved, measuring 50 by 62½\r\ncentimetres (20 in. by 24½ in.), and contains a grant to the church of\r\nan estate near Königswinter, belonging to the Emperor.\r\n\r\nTHE tercentary of the death of William the Silent was celebrated in July\r\nat Delft, in Holland, by a solemn service in the church. The Prince’s\r\ntomb was magnificently decorated with funeral wreaths, including one in\r\nsilver offered by a deputation of Freemasons. The church was filled by a\r\nnumerous congregation, all the Ministers and the principal civil and\r\nmilitary authorities being present. Professor Van Vries, of Leyden,\r\ndelivered an address, reviewing in eloquent terms the memorable work\r\naccomplished by the founder of Dutch independence. The whole ceremony\r\nmade a profound impression upon the assembly. At its conclusion the\r\nexhibition was opened, at Prinsenhof, the house in which William was\r\nassassinated by Balthasar Gerard, of relics of the Prince and a number\r\nof objects illustrating his life and works.\r\n\r\nTHE _Athenæum_ says that the death of Mr. Archibald Fraser, of\r\nAbertarff, is bringing memories of Jacobite times before the public.\r\nOnly the other day the history of the Lovat family was to some extent\r\nbefore the Court of Session in connection with the succession to the\r\nestate of Abertarff, which was bequeathed to the late Mr. Fraser by his\r\ngrandfather, a son of the notorious Lord Lovat, with an ultimate entail\r\n“in favour of the person who shall be able to prove himself to be the\r\nchief of the clan Fraser by legitimate descent from Hugh, first Lord\r\nLovat, and his heirs male.” At the beginning of next month, the\r\nAbertarff collection of antiques, pictures, arms, &c., comprising many\r\nrelics of the rebel lord and of the old family of Lovat, will be sold in\r\nInverness by public auction.\r\n\r\nSOME discoveries of great interest to antiquaries have been made on the\r\nYorkshire Wolds by the Rev. E. M. Cole, M.A., vicar of Wetwang,\r\nYorkshire--viz., a large number of entrenchments, which are supposed to\r\nhave been the work of the ancient Britons. The dale “heads,” it has been\r\nascertained, are all covered with entrenchments, and a village called\r\nFimber appears to be completely surrounded by them, as if it had been an\r\nenormous camp. In one of these entrenchments, near the monument to the\r\nlate Sir Tatton Sykes, at Garton, a large number of dead bodies were\r\nfound, but the idea is not entertained that the entrenchments were used\r\nfor purposes of burial. According to Mr. J. R. Mortimer, a well-known\r\nYorkshire archæologist, they are mostly V-shaped. They appear to have\r\nbeen much used, and are trodden hard and firm.\r\n\r\nA LARGE Indian mound near the town of Gasterville, North America, has\r\nrecently been opened and examined by a committee sent out from the\r\nSmithsonian Institute. At some depth from the surface a kind of vault\r\nwas found, in which was discovered the skeleton of a giant measuring 7\r\nft. 2 in. His hair was coarse and jet black, and hung down to the waist,\r\nthe brow being ornamented with a copper crown. The skeleton was\r\nremarkably well preserved. Near it were also found the bodies of several\r\nchildren of various sizes, the remains being covered with beads made of\r\nbone of some kind. Upon removing these the bodies were seen to be\r\nenclosed in a network of straw or reeds, and beneath this was a covering\r\nof the skin of some animal. On the stones which covered the vault were\r\ncarved inscriptions, and these when deciphered will doubtless lift the\r\nveil that now shrouds the history of a race of giants that at one time\r\nundoubtedly inhabited the American continent. The relics have been\r\nforwarded to the Smithsonian Institute, and they are said to be the most\r\ninteresting collection ever found in the United States. The explorers\r\nexplored another mound in Bartow county, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nTHE excavations of General Cesnola have not exhausted the possibilities\r\nof Cyprus, and surely if Englishmen are to excavate anywhere, this\r\nisland is the natural field for their labours. A committee, consisting\r\nof Englishmen and Cypriotes, was formed in 1882 by Sir Robert Biddulph,\r\nwith the object of establishing a local museum at Leukosia. Under the\r\nauspices of the committee, excavations on a small scale and supported by\r\nprivate subscriptions have been carried on in the years 1883-1884. It is\r\na little surprising that these excavations have had to be conducted by a\r\nGerman, Herr Max Ohnefalsch Richter, and that the report appears this\r\nmonth in a German periodical, the _Mittheilungen_, of the German\r\narchæological institute at Athens. The site chosen was the village of\r\nVoni, the ancient Chytrai, and the find has been a large one. It\r\nspeedily became evident from a multitude of inscriptions that the\r\nexcavators had lighted on a sanctuary of Apollo. The architectural\r\nremains are insignificant, but there is evidence that on the remains of\r\nthe old pagan shrine a Christian church had been raised, into the walls\r\nof which a mass of fragments of ancient sculpture was built. The\r\nsculptural find was a very rich one; as many as 133 statues are already\r\ncatalogued.--_Builder._\r\n\r\nTHE _Athenæum_ announces that a strong committee, upon which the Society\r\nof Antiquaries is represented by Lord Carnarvon, Dr. Perceval, Mr.\r\nMilman, Mr. Franks, Dr. John Evans, Dr. Freshfield, the Hon. Harold\r\nDillon, Mr. Hilton Price, Mr. Roach Smith, and other Fellows; the\r\nInstitute of Architects by Mr. Whichcord; the City of London by the Lord\r\nMayor, Sir Reginald Hanson, Alderman Staples, Sir John Monckton,\r\nEx-Sheriff Burt, Mr. Deputy Saunders, Mr. William Rome, and others; the\r\nMetropolitan Board of Works by its chairman, Sir J. M‘Garel Hogg; and\r\nLondon archæology generally by Mr. Hyde Clarke, Mr. Anderson Rose, Mr.\r\nHerbert Fry, Mr. Henry W. King, and others, has been formed to raise a\r\nfund for taking immediate steps to protect and record monuments of\r\nantiquity in London and its vicinity at the moment of discovery. The\r\nexecutive committee consists of Mr. Alfred White, Mr. Overall (the City\r\nLibrarian), Mr. John E. Price (secretary), and Mr. Brabrook. Sir John\r\nLubbock has consented to act as treasurer. The committee is already\r\ntaking steps, through Mr. J. E. Price, to preserve and place in a public\r\nmuseum some remarkable remains of the Roman occupation of London which\r\nhave just been found used as building material in a bastion of the wall\r\nat Bevis Marks.\r\n\r\nUP to the present time the _form_ of the Rigveda, that curious\r\ncollection of ancient Indian poems which has long engaged the attention\r\nof scholars in India and Europe, has remained an inscrutable mystery.\r\nThe 1,017 hymns follow one another in ten books or sections, but no one\r\nhas hitherto detected any system in their arrangement. Mr. Frederic\r\nPincott, however, has, the _Manchester Guardian’s_ London correspondent\r\nsays, just discovered the hidden method, and his discovery promises to\r\ngive a new impetus and direction to Vedic studies. He has found that the\r\nfirst book of the Rigveda is a selection of hymns arranged in the order\r\nof their recitation at the offering of an oblation to the sacred Soma\r\nJuice. The next six books are family collections, containing the poems\r\nof particular poets and their relatives; whilst the eighth book contains\r\nhymns omitted from previous books. The ninth book is filled with hymns\r\ncelebrating the praises of the Soma Juice, and the last book contains\r\nhymns ascribed to mythological authors. When the poet, the deity, the\r\nlength, and the metre are known, the hymns are found to have a\r\nmethodical arrangement. A full exposition of Mr. Pincott’s curious\r\ndiscovery is about to be given in the _Journal of the Royal Asiatic\r\nSociety_.\r\n\r\nA BIBLE which contains two signatures that profess to be written by\r\nShakespeare has turned up at Manchester. It was bought about thirty\r\nyears ago by the late Mr. William Sharp, a somewhat eccentric collector,\r\nwho was firmly convinced of the authenticity of the signatures, but\r\nrarely showed the book. Its present custodian exhibited it the other day\r\nto a number of gentlemen at the Manchester Free Library, including Prof.\r\nA. Ward, Mr. Alexander Ireland, Mr. C. W. Sutton, Mr. J. H. Nodal, and\r\nMr. W. E. A. Axon. One signature is on the inside of the end cover, and\r\nreads “William Shakspere off S × o × A his Bible 1613.” The other is on\r\nthe reversed title of the New Testament, and reads “William Shakspere\r\n1614.” The volume contains the Old Testament, Apocrypha, New Testament,\r\nand Psalms of the “breeches” edition of 1611, but some of the earlier\r\nleaves are gone. There are many names of other possessors from about\r\n1633 downwards, and one entry appears to indicate that the volume has\r\nbeen rebound and a Prayer-Book taken from it. In this case the signature\r\nnow on the end leaf may have been transferred to the new binding. As to\r\nthe authenticity of the signatures it would be impossible to speak with\r\nconfidence without the application of more searching tests. They do not\r\nresemble any of the five undoubted signatures, but they are both\r\nmarvellously like that on the title-page of Florio’s Montaigne now in\r\nthe British Museum. The present custodian of the “Shakspere Bible”\r\npurposes, we understand, to accept the advice tendered to him of\r\nsubmitting it to a critical examination at the British Museum.--_Public\r\nOpinion._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: text decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAntiquarian Correspondence.\r\n\r\n                      Sin scire labores,\r\n    Quære, age: quærenti pagina nostra patet.\r\n\r\n_All communications must be accompanied by the name and address of the\r\nsender, not necessarily for publication._\r\n\r\n\r\nA BISHOP ON ARCHÆOLOGY.\r\n\r\nSIR,--At the reopening of a church in Northamptonshire recently, the\r\nBishop of Peterborough is reported to have observed that churches were\r\nnot architectural museums merely designed for the recreation and\r\ninstruction of persons of an architectural turn of mind, but places\r\ndesigned for worship and the comfort of those who attended them, and\r\nthat whatever interfered with such objects should be removed.

E.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUERIN, COUNT OF MONTGLAVE.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In the preface of Mr. Charles Tomlin’s “Chess Manual,” particulars\r\nare given of a game of chess, said to have been played between\r\nCharlemagne and Guérin, a powerful noble of Aquitaine, the stakes to be\r\nGuérin’s possessions against the kingdom of France. The Emperor lost,\r\nbut it was at last arranged that, in lieu of France, Guérin was to\r\nreceive the Countship of Montglave, or Lyons, if he could wrest the\r\nplace from the Saracens, who then held it. This, with the aid of his\r\nknights and followers, he is said to have done, taking prisoners Gasier,\r\nthe Sultan, and his only daughter, Mabiletta, whom he afterwards married\r\non her becoming a Christian. They had four sons. A romance recounting\r\nthe adventures and victories of these four sons was printed by M. Michel\r\nle Noir, 1515, under the title of “L’Histoire de Guérin de Montglave,”\r\nsince which date, and under the same title, the story has been\r\nreproduced in prose and verse by several authors, but in none are any\r\ndetails respecting their father, Guérin, given, although frequent\r\nmention of both Mabiletta and the Count are made, representing him as\r\nthe great friend, as well as one of the chief captains of Charlemagne.\r\nCan any of your readers inform me where particulars respecting this\r\nGuérin, the game of chess, and his victory over the Saracens, &c., are\r\nto be found?--Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nWM.

Like many another publication, doomed to an\r\nephemeral existence, it deserved other and better treatment.\r\n\r\nThe _Border Miscellany_, or, as it is printed on the illustrated cover,\r\n_Thompson’s Border Miscellany_, was published at Berwick-on-Tweed,\r\nMarch, 1852, price sixpence, and though consisting of only forty-eight\r\npages, octavo, it contains several exceedingly interesting items, among\r\nwhich I would reckon an “Unpublished Letter of Sir Walter Scott,” “Atoms\r\nof Information,” and the article of rather more than eight pages,\r\nentitled “The Tweed and its Tributaries,” by a disciple of Isaak Walton.\r\nThe extracts from the Books of Council and Session, under the heading,\r\n“Memoranda Scotica,” are also interesting, especially to those who may\r\nhave the genealogy of the Oliphants and other Scottish families at\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThe story with which the _Miscellany_ opens, “Florrette; or, Henri\r\nQuatre’s First Love,” adapted from the German of Zschokke, by Bon\r\nGualtier, is, in my humble estimation, a piece of dull, uninteresting\r\nreading. The poetry, literary notices, and some other odds and ends, do\r\nnot call for special recognition.\r\n\r\nHere is the motto of this short-lived magazine:--\r\n\r\n           “L’ENVOY.\r\n\r\n    For us and our Miscellany,\r\n    Here, stooping to your clemency,\r\n    We beg your hearing patiently.\r\n         SHAKESPEARE (New Edition).”\r\n\r\nOn the back cover the following note of warning appeared:--\r\n\r\n     “Publishers are warned that the articles in this Miscellany are\r\n     copyright. When short extracts from any of the papers are quoted,\r\n     it will be obliging if the name of the Miscellany be prefixed.”\r\n\r\nWho the editor of this venture was I know not, though I am aware that it\r\nwas published by W. Thompson, at the time and place already mentioned.\r\nPerhaps some of your readers can throw light on the matter.\r\n\r\nP. J. MULLIN.\r\n\r\n_Leith, N.B._\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTREEVE.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Should any of your readers feel further interest in this subject,\r\nI would beg to refer them to your September number for my defence\r\nagainst Mr. Round’s repeated attacks, and contrast my paper with the\r\nmisrepresentations which are now made of it in his note for this month.\r\nI would fain assume that these misrepresentations are not intentional,\r\nand that they may rather be attributed to that “lamentable\r\nconfusion--truly distressing confusion,” which another contributor to\r\nyour pages has described as characteristic of a former paper by Mr.\r\nRound, and which, indeed, seems to pervade all his papers. That these\r\nmisrepresentations, however, exist will not for a moment be doubted by\r\nanyone who may make the comparison above suggested, and their existence,\r\nfrom whatever cause arising, must for the future preclude my bestowing\r\nany further notice of anything emanating from Mr. Round.\r\n\r\nIt seems almost unnecessary to specify any of the misrepresentations in\r\nquestion, but as something of the kind may be expected, and for the\r\nsatisfaction of those who may not have seen my paper, or have an\r\nopportunity of easily referring to it, I will just cite one or two\r\nexamples out of the numerous ones with which Mr. Round’s note abounds.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, as regards the term “port or gate.” In employing the term\r\nport or gate as I did in my first paper, it was in the full assurance\r\nthat these words are here absolutely _synonymous_, and that I was\r\nstrictly correct in thus using the word _port_ where it occurs in the\r\nLaws of Athelstan. On this point, however, Mr. Round thought fit to\r\nassail me, asserting that my “rendering outside the port or gate” was a\r\nmere “gloss” of _my own_ on the word “port.” In consequence of this\r\nstrange and somewhat unintelligible charge I was led to look into the\r\nquestion more closely, and found, though previously unaware of the fact,\r\nthat I was entirely supported in my view and use of the words both by\r\nCamden and by Sharon Turner. In my next paper I accordingly quoted from\r\nCamden that at “_Portgate_,” on the Roman Wall, there was formerly _a\r\ngate_, as “_the word in both languages_” (Roman and Saxon) “fairly\r\nevinces.” On this passage, which it will be seen completely establishes\r\nmy case, Mr. Round “evinces” _his_ sense of fairness by suppressing all\r\nallusion to it. Again, it was pointed out that Sharon Turner distinctly\r\nuses the words as _synonymous_ where he speaks of “the _port_-gerefa\r\n_or_ the gerefa of the _gate_.” Nothing can be clearer or stronger than\r\nthis, yet all notice of this is also suppressed, and Mr. Round, even\r\nafter this has been pointed out to him, does not scruple to misrepresent\r\nme by repeating his assertion, and still arguing that in thus rendering\r\nthe words “port or gate,” the words “or gate” are a mere “_gloss_” of\r\n_my own_. What opprobrium he intends to convey by the word “gloss” it is\r\ndifficult to say, but, whatever it may be, your readers will now see\r\nthat it applies quite as strongly to such high authorities as Camden and\r\nSharon Turner as it does to me.\r\n\r\nFurther on, Mr. Round states that he has proved by demonstration that\r\nthe markets were not held at the gates. I remarked in my paper that he\r\nmight have spared himself the pains of proving what no one ever doubted,\r\n“the well-known fact that the forum was situated in the centre of a\r\nRoman town or city”; but I also pointed out what Mr. Round appears still\r\nto be ignorant of, that _large transactions were conducted at the\r\ngates_, the levying of tolls and the sale and purchase of merchandise,\r\nand thus “the word _port_, originally restricted to _the gates_ where\r\nsuch extensive transactions were carried on, would at no distant period\r\nbecome applied,” in the way described, “to the town itself” (p. 114).\r\n\r\nThis latter passage, and all allusion to it, Mr. Round also suppresses,\r\nsatisfying his sense of fair and reasonable argument in this case by\r\nmerely harping again on the statement that “_I proved_ by demonstration\r\nthat the markets were never held at the gate,” which, in fact, no one at\r\nall conversant with the subject ever thought they were.\r\n\r\nApart, then, from what has here been thus briefly exposed, the character\r\nof Mr. Round’s papers is otherwise such as would deter me from giving\r\nany further time to their discussion.\r\n\r\nA profuse rush of words--“_verba et voces prætereaque nihil_”--which\r\nseem to shun all approach to logical sequence, will not in the present\r\nday be accepted in place of the legitimate rules of reasoning, neither\r\nwill they justify a writer who indulges in them in dispensing with the\r\nordinary rules of courtesy.\r\n\r\nJAMES HURLY PRING, M.D.\r\n\r\n_Taunton, October, 1884._\r\n\r\n\r\n_TO CORRESPONDENTS._\r\n\r\nTHE Editor declines to pledge himself for the safety or return of MSS.\r\nvoluntarily tendered to him by strangers.\r\n\r\nMUS RUSTICUS.--You will find a good description of a Lord Mayor’s Show\r\nin the reign of James I. in F.

When the attention of the\r\npublic is taken up with “wars and rumours of wars,” abroad or at home,\r\nand when at home political parties have broken out into open strife,\r\nthere is no chance for the Muses or their votaries to get a hearing. To\r\nno other cause can I ascribe the fact that my countrymen and\r\ncountrywomen made no response, or next to none, when they were lately\r\nasked by the Mayor of Lichfield, Dr. Johnson’s native city, whether the\r\ncentenary of his death should be celebrated, and if so, then how?\r\n\r\nFor the last three months and more the English world has been so\r\noccupied with the _pros_ and _cons_ of Mr. Gladstone’s Franchise Bill,\r\nthat to the above appeal society has turned a deaf ear. I regret it, but\r\nI am scarcely surprised. We have not forgotten to observe the centenary\r\nof Robert Raikes, as the reputed founder of Sunday-schools; it is not so\r\nvery long since the centenary of Robert Burns was celebrated, not by the\r\nScottish people only, but by Englishmen, at the Crystal Palace and\r\nelsewhere; but, shame to write and to say it, there is no response when\r\nEnglishmen are asked to commemorate the author of the first really good\r\nEnglish Dictionary, the author of the best collection of Lives of our\r\nEnglish Poets, the man who almost in defiance of the law, and at the\r\nrisk of a prosecution, first really called into existence the practice\r\nof reporting the Debates of Parliament; the greatest practical\r\nphilosopher and teacher of the last century; the man who first raised\r\nand ennobled the profession of the pen; and the man who twice at least\r\nstood up, as few have stood up, on behalf of that profession, firstly,\r\nwhen he flung back with contempt the tardily offered favour and\r\n“patronage” of Lord Chesterfield, and, secondly, when he knocked down\r\nthe insolent publisher, Thomas Osborne, in his own shop, with one of his\r\nown folio volumes. Is not such a man, I ask, deserving of a Centenary\r\ncelebration from his brethren of the pen, or, let me say, rather from\r\nhis sons and disciples?\r\n\r\nBut to be serious. There can be little doubt that if all that he said,\r\nand wrote, and did, be fairly considered, few men can claim credit for\r\nhaving lived more useful lives than Dr. Johnson. Long before the end of\r\nthat life arrived, King George III. had spontaneously borne testimony to\r\nhis merits by the gift, rare at that time, of a literary pension, adding\r\na graceful compliment: “I should perhaps have thought that you had\r\nwritten enough, if you had not written so well.” Born in humble, though\r\nnot needy circumstances, unable to complete his education and to obtain\r\nan Oxford degree by the _res angusta domi_, he came to London to fight\r\nthe battle of life, his only weapon being his pen, and he won the day\r\nagainst all difficulties, the cold indifference of the rich, the\r\njealousies of his equals and contemporaries, and the heart-breaking and\r\nniggardly doles of the London publishers. Undaunted by these and other\r\ndifficulties, he showed Edmund Cave how his new venture, the\r\n_Gentleman’s Magazine_, might come to deserve its name on other grounds\r\nthan that alleged at first, viz., that it was not fit for any lady to\r\nread it. He raised, by his essays and biographical sketches, the whole\r\nstyle and character of that which in the middle of the last century was\r\none of the leading organs of the time, when the daily papers as yet were\r\nnot, and the country gentleman’s household had to depend for the news of\r\nthe day on the “news-letter” written specially for their amusement and\r\ninformation. Till Johnson took the matter in hand, and set himself to\r\nsupply the want by a new method which his native wit suggested, the\r\ncountry knew not one iota of the speeches delivered in the Houses of\r\nParliament; the legislation of the country was carried on in the dark,\r\nso far as concerned the people at large. If he had done nothing else\r\nthan this, Dr. Johnson would deserve, at the very least, the honour of a\r\nstatue on the Thames Embankment, or of a scholarship bearing his name at\r\nPembroke College, Oxford, the scene of his early struggles.\r\n\r\nI am not intending to write a life of Dr. Johnson. That has been done\r\nwith wondrous fidelity and graphic skill by his _fidus Achates_, James\r\nBoswell; and Sir John Hawkins and Mrs. Thrale-Piozzi, in their\r\nsupplemental Memoirs and Recollections of him, have thrown most\r\ninteresting and valuable side-lights on his character. Boswell’s “Life\r\nof Dr. Johnson,” as every reader of English literature knows, was\r\nlargely amplified, and most cruelly distorted, by John Wilson Croker,\r\nwho, though himself a Tory of Tories, seems to have been unable to\r\ncomprehend the character of the man who hated a Whig almost as much as\r\nhe hated a Scotchman; and Mr. Croker was almost as cruelly punished for\r\nhis offence by Macaulay, who cut his book into shreds in the _Edinburgh\r\nReview_. Still, in spite of its glaring sins, not certainly of omission,\r\nbut of commission, Croker’s edition of Boswell will always be a work of\r\nvalue, for he entered on his task before the last of Dr. Johnson’s\r\nfriends and acquaintances had passed away. Amongst these were Lord\r\nStowell, who figures in Boswell as “Dr. Scott of Doctors’ Commons;” Mr.\r\nJohn Sidney Hawkins, and Miss Letitia Hawkins, the son and daughter of\r\nSir John Hawkins; Mr. Fitzherbert (afterwards Lord St. Helen’s); Miss\r\nMonckton, the Lady Cork of the Regency, a “Queen of Society” under\r\nGeorge IV. and William IV., and who lived into the reign of Victoria. He\r\nknew also Mrs. Thrale’s daughter, the venerable Lady Keith; and last,\r\nnot least, the still more venerable Dr. Routh, President of Magdalen\r\nCollege, who had seen Dr. Johnson in the flesh at Oxford, and who lived\r\nto December, 1854. From these and from other sources he gathered much\r\nmaterial which had not been available to Boswell, and had he been\r\ncontent with facts instead of probabilities and possibilities, he would\r\ndoubtless have been proof and unassailable to Macaulay’s pen. For\r\ninstance, there is not the shadow of a ground for supposing (as he does)\r\nthat Dr. Johnson was “out in ’45” with the adherents of Charles Edward,\r\nexcept the fact that in that year his pen was idle; and he is still less\r\njustified in supposing that Dr. Johnson was a Roman Catholic because he\r\nadvocated the _principle_ of pilgrimages, and prayers for the dead, and\r\nconfession, as natural and right in themselves, and as distinct from\r\ntheir abuses; because there is not a single Roman Catholic tenet, except\r\nthat of the divinely-appointed Primacy of the See of St. Peter, which\r\nhas not at one time or another been supported and defended by some\r\nProtestant writer.\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson, it must be owned even by his adversaries, has left his mark\r\nupon the literature of his country. Gibbon’s style is most ornate, but\r\nit is cumbrous and unnatural, and the author of the “Decline and Fall”\r\nhas found no one to copy him. It was otherwise with Johnson. He was fond\r\nof Ciceronian Latin, and his English smacked as strongly of the\r\nCiceronian flavour as did Dr. Pusey’s style of the Augustinian. For\r\nmyself, I infinitely prefer the short and simple words which come from\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon mint to what is now sneeringly called “Johnsonese.” But\r\nI cannot shut my eyes to that “union of perspicuity and splendour,” that\r\nnervous vigour, that “expansion and harmony” which mark the stately flow\r\nof Johnson when he is at his best. Towards the end of every unmutilated\r\nedition of Boswell’s “Life” is given a list of those who in earnest or\r\nin jest have set themselves to imitate the burly Doctor’s style.\r\nForemost amongst these are the historians Robertson and Gibbon, the Rev.\r\nDr. Nares, George Colman, Professor Young, of Glasgow, the Rev. Dr.\r\nKnox, the popularity of whose writings is ascribed to this very feature,\r\nand some of the best contributors to the old Edinburgh _Mirror_. There\r\nis no doubt also that Dr. Johnson’s style was very largely but almost\r\ninsensibly copied and reproduced in the sermons, charges, and essays of\r\nmost Bishops and dignitaries of the Established Church for some sixty or\r\nseventy years after his death. In fact, Dr. Johnson may be said in a\r\nvery great degree to have “tuned their pulpits.” It is only of later\r\nyears, concurrently with the study of German and of Anglo-Saxon\r\nliterature in this country, that a simpler and less stilted style has\r\nprevailed. And this is no small testimony to the great powers of the\r\n“learned lexicographer.”\r\n\r\nThe value of his Dictionary has, of course, declined since the study of\r\nEtymology has been raised to the dignity of a science; for Dr. Johnson\r\nknew little or nothing of those primitive languages from which all the\r\nEuropean languages are derived, and of which they are at the root only\r\nvariations and dialects. His Dictionary, therefore, must be judged by\r\nthe standard of a century ago, not by that of the Victorian Era. Were\r\nDr. Johnson now alive, he would be among the first to say to Professor\r\nSkeat, to Max Müller, and our other lexicographers, “_agnosco\r\nprocerem_,” and to own that since his own day in this branch of\r\nlearning, at least, we have made giant strides.\r\n\r\nAs the last and only surviving Editor of the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ in\r\nits former shape, when it dealt with the intelligence and the literature\r\nof the age, and was a recognised organ of the educated world, I feel\r\nthat it is my duty at this moment to put in a few words on behalf of a\r\nman whose literary merits have never been sufficiently acknowledged.\r\nWith all his ruggedness and even “bearishness” of manner, what a\r\ncontrast does he present to us, as he lives in Boswell, to the cross,\r\ncrabbed, snappish, and selfish “philosopher of Chelsea,” who equalled\r\nhim in nothing but in plodding industry, and surpassed him, _me judice_,\r\nin bearishness alone! And how few of the present generation are there\r\nwho might not learn lessons of improvement, both moral and intellectual,\r\nby a careful and patient study of the “wit and wisdom” of Samuel\r\nJohnson!\r\n\r\nE. WALFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDown a Yorkshire River.\r\n\r\n_PART II._\r\n\r\n(_Continued from p._ 218.)\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW miles lower down, passing through Sowerby Bridge, commercially\r\nthriving but poetically poor, we come again to green fields and remnants\r\nof ancient forest, and notice on the left hand Wood Hall, where the boy\r\nLaurence Sterne, of “Tristram Shandy” fame, spent his early years. The\r\nHeath Grammar School, where he was educated, is half an hour’s walk\r\nbeyond the ridge of the hill in the direction of Halifax. Formerly a\r\nrustic bridge, little better than a plank, spanned the river near Wood\r\nHall, and it was along this plank, there is little doubt, that Lucy\r\nGray’s footprints were tracked after she had slipped into the water. We\r\nhave now reached a point where the scenery, if less wild than the glens\r\nand gorges near the border hills of Lancashire and Yorkshire, is\r\nscarcely less beautiful, and what it loses in ruggedness of natural\r\ncontour it gains in historic associations and legendary romance. Copley\r\nHall, in the eleventh century the residence of the knightly family of\r\nCopley, has long ago been turned into cottages, but the name survives in\r\nthe pretty modern village and prettier church, and antiquaries love to\r\ndwell on the old stories connected with the spot, and tell how Adam de\r\nCopley fell fighting for William the Conqueror at the siege of York; how\r\nhis grandson, another Adam de Copley, became rector of his parish church\r\nat Halifax; and how a third Sir Adam, for this was a favourite name,\r\ncarried away a sister from Kirklees Nunnery, and afterwards joined the\r\nCrusaders and died in Palestine. This fair nun, alas! was immured in a\r\ntower seven stories high, and mysterious lights were long seen to burn\r\nin the ladye’s chamber, the ruins of which are said to have been\r\nvisible some years ago. Elland, anciently and more correctly Ealand,\r\nwith its fine old fane and relics of mediæval times, where the Ealands\r\nand the Saviles lived in barbaric splendour, was the scene of many a\r\nthrilling legend and bloody fray, notably the tragedy, or rather chain\r\nof tragedies, which ended in the murder of Sir John Ealand and his\r\nlittle boy as they were crossing the weir-stones on Palm Sunday on their\r\nway to matins at Saint Mary’s. By this deed, which took place in the\r\nfourteenth century, a feud that had lasted two generations was brought\r\nto an end, as was likewise the family name of Ealand, the male line of\r\nwhich became extinct on the death of Sir John’s only boy, the child who\r\nshared his father’s fate on the weir-stones. A few miles beyond Ealand,\r\non the hill slope above the Calder, stand the stately groves of Kirklees\r\nPriory, so well known, as we have seen, to the gay Sir Adam de Copley.\r\nAt Kirklees, as many readers are aware, died the most chivalrous of\r\nbandits, Robin Hood. His grave, overshadowed by majestic beeches, is not\r\nfar from the ruins of the Nunnery, but in unconsecrated ground, though\r\nit is said there used to be a cross to mark the spot. Calder dale was a\r\nfavourite haunt of the merry men, and many the fat buck they have run\r\ndown in this valley. Robin Hood has left his name in several places\r\nhereabouts, and the peasantry still love to repeat the traditionary\r\nstories of his gallantry and daring. Pinder Green, near Wakefield, as we\r\nread in ballad line, was the scene of an encounter between Robin and the\r\nJolly Pinder. But we have not left the ruins of the Priory. I suppose\r\nthat all lovers of Brontëan literature know that the scene of “Shirley”\r\nis laid close to Kirklees, which place figures indeed in the novel as\r\nNunnely. Any one acquainted with the locality will recognise Kirklees\r\nvery thinly disguised under this name: “The village of Nunnely has been\r\nalluded to: its old church, its forest, its monastic ruins. It had also\r\nits Hall, called the Priory--an older, a larger, a more lordly abode\r\nthan any Briarfield or Whinbury owned; and, what is more, it had its man\r\nof title--its baronet, which neither Briarfield nor Whinbury could\r\nboast.” In another chapter Kirklees is thus spoken of: “Kind gentleman\r\nas the baronet is, he asked the tutor too; but the tutor would much\r\nsooner have made an appointment with the ghost of the Earl of Huntingdon\r\nto meet him, and a shadowy ring of his merry men, under the canopy of\r\nthe thickest, blackest, oldest oak in Nunnely Forest. Yes, he would\r\nrather have appointed tryst with a phantom abbess, or mist-pale nun,\r\namong the wet and weedy relics of that ruined sanctuary of theirs,\r\nmouldering in the core of the wood.”\r\n\r\nThe scenery now begins to lose those romantic features down to this\r\npoint so noticeable in this valley. Larger towns and numerous\r\nmanufacturing villages disturb the once pastoral quietude. Keeping to\r\nthe bank of the river we pass Mirfield, and shortly reach Dewsbury,\r\nwhere Paulinus, the first Archbishop of York, preached in the early part\r\nof the seventh century--“Paulinus hic prædicavit et celebravit, A.D.\r\n627.” Some years ago there was an old cross commemorating this event.\r\nAnd here in the Calder, I doubt not, the great Apostle of the North\r\nbaptized hundreds of converts. The ancient Saxon parish of Dewsbury\r\ncontained an area of 400 square miles. Travel we on and we come to\r\nWakefield, in the meadows close to which was fought one of the most\r\nsanguinary battles in the Wars of the Roses. On Wakefield bridge, which\r\nspans the Calder, there is a lovely little chapelle, recently restored,\r\nthought to have been originally erected in the reign of Edward III., and\r\nsaid to have been rebuilt by Edward IV. to commemorate the death of his\r\nfather, the Duke of York, and the young Earl of Rutland, the beautiful\r\nboy so ruthlessly slain there by Lord Clifford. The Calder, flowing on\r\npast the villages of Heath and Stanley, eventually loses itself in the\r\nAire at Castleford. Hence the distich:\r\n\r\n    “Castleford lasses must needs be fair,\r\n     Since they wash themselves both in Calder and Aire.”\r\n\r\nNear the border hills, some of the tributary brooks that join the Calder\r\nare streams of rare beauty, and flow through regions of sylvan wildness,\r\nthan which there are none finer in Derbyshire or Devon. If the traveller\r\nhad to turn aside and wander up one of these glens he would soon leave\r\nbehind him the din of trade, and find himself in ravine-like woodland\r\nsolitudes. One of the loveliest and loneliest of these brooks is Turvin,\r\nborn on the bleak summit of Blackstone Edge, and which precipitates\r\nitself in narrow winding channels through many a clough and forest dell.\r\nWhen the shadows of the gloaming steal over the world, it is an eerie\r\nsight to watch the mists of autumn as they creep up the gorge and curl\r\nround the rocks, and the spectator may almost realise that he is gazing\r\nupon some weird and enchanted land. About the middle of last century\r\nthis glen was the haunt of a gang of coiners who for many years\r\nsucceeded in eluding and defying the officers of the law. That these\r\ndaring men carried on their nefarious practices was a fact well known to\r\neverybody in the locality, and it is to be feared they were secretly\r\nencouraged, as they were assuredly screened, by their neighbours and\r\nrelatives. Something like a feeling of awe, tradition says, was felt by\r\nthe cottagers on the distant hills, when they heard in the stillness of\r\nnight the stroke of the sledge-hammer as the coiners plied, almost\r\ndefiantly plied, their desperate work. At last some of the ringleaders\r\nwere captured, tried, and hung. The rest of the gang still at large took\r\ntheir revenge by murdering the excise officer who had been instrumental\r\nin bringing the culprits to justice. Other captures were made and more\r\nmurder followed. But in the end, after a twenty years’ lease of\r\nsuccessful defiance, this band of reckless coiners was broken up.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Blackstone Edge and the glens leading therefrom down to\r\nCalder dale, we are reminded of the impression this mountain with its\r\nwild passes and rugged roads had on Taylor, the Water Poet, who crossed\r\nover in 1639, and this is what he says: “When I left Halifax I rode over\r\nsuch ways as were past comparison or amendment, for when I went down the\r\nlofty mountain called Blackstone Edge, I thought myself in the land of\r\nbreak-necke, it was so steep and tedious.” Over this mountain, but in\r\nthe opposite direction, wearily paced De Foe when on his way to take\r\nrefuge in Halifax, perhaps resting a little while by the riverside\r\nbefore he climbed the steep ascent of Skircote. Whilst staying in\r\nHalifax he is said to have written part of “Robinson Crusoe.”\r\n\r\nFair features in woman are not irremediably spoiled by accident of cut\r\nand scar, or through waste of fever and pain: the lovely lines survive,\r\nand the soul beneath breathes unspeakable subtle beauty in smile of the\r\neye and play of emotion on the eloquent face. Such is it with fair\r\nCalder dale--a region of poetry and romance, of legendary rock and\r\nhistoric hall, of mountain and glen, of shaw and burn, of daisied meadow\r\nand ferny dell. From the spot where I write, looking out at the antique\r\nlattice, I see the long sweep of the valley with its wide openings and\r\ngorge-like ravines stretching through the heart and the solitude of the\r\neverlasting hills, and though smoke blackens and mill mars the\r\nlandscape, there is a loveliness about the contour of high heath-clad\r\ncliff, about the green waving woods musical with bird carol and summer\r\nbreeze, about the sun-bright waters winding and narrowing miles away to\r\na silver streak, which the accidents of trade and material civilisation\r\nhave very far from irretrievably ruined.\r\n\r\nF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Legend of King Arthur in Somerset.\r\n\r\nBY MRS. C. G. BOGER.\r\n\r\n_PART III.--HIS BURIAL-PLACE AT GLASTONBURY._\r\n\r\n(_Concluded from p. 19._)\r\n\r\n    “Not great Arthur’s tomb, nor holy Joseph’s grave\r\n     From sacrilege had power their sacred bones to save;\r\n     He who that God in man to his sepulchre brought,\r\n     Or he which for the faith twelve famous battles fought.”\r\n              DRAYTON’S _Polyolbion_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH Arthur perished the bright gleam of hope for the British race, but\r\nthe Saxons did not as yet advance farther westward, and it was not till\r\nthe seventh century that Gladerhaf became Somerset. That he was buried\r\nat Glastonbury men knew, but the exact spot remained a secret from all,\r\nand so the record of Arthur’s life and labours became a myth on which\r\nthe earliest and latest British poets alike have loved to dwell and\r\nidealise, till men scarce believed that he had any existence save in the\r\nrealms of romance. Long years passed away. “The old order had changed\r\nand yielded place to new” more than once. The Britons had been avenged,\r\nfor the Saxons had passed under the power of the Dane, and then rose\r\nagain only to submit to the Norman. Yet the Saxons were never so crushed\r\nas the Britons had been, for the Teutons have a staying power and a\r\npower of combination that seem to have been denied to the Kelts. Only in\r\nWales did the ancient race preserve their individuality. But a weird and\r\ntroubled rule was that of the Norman father fighting against son, and\r\nbrother against brother; and now it was in the year 1177 that Henry II.,\r\nwhen on his journey to Ireland, to receive the submission of the princes\r\nof that country, passed through Pembroke, and was there entertained by\r\nsome of the Welsh chieftains. Whilst there, “it chanced to him to heare\r\nsung to the harpe certaine ditties of the worthy exploits and actes of\r\nthis Arthur by one of the Welsh bards, as they were termed, whose custom\r\nwas to record and sing at their feasts the noble deeds of their\r\nancestors, wherein mention was made of his death and place of buriall,\r\ndesigning it to be in the monks’ burial ground at Glastonbury, and that\r\nbetwixt two pyramids there standing.”[79]\r\n\r\nKing Henry made this known to his cousin Henry of Blois, who was at once\r\nAbbot of Glastonbury and Bishop of Winchester, but no steps seem to\r\nhave been taken in his time to ascertain its truth; and it was not till\r\nafter his death that, in the reign of Richard, Henry de Soliaco, nephew\r\nof the late king and Abbot of Glastonbury, instituted a search, the\r\nresult of which has been described by Giraldus Cambrensis, the historian\r\nof his time, who was present when the grave was opened.\r\n\r\n“At the depth of seven feet was a huge broad stone, whereon a leaden\r\ncross was fastened: on that part that lay downward, in rude and\r\nbarbarous letters (as rudely set and contrived) this inscription was\r\nwritten upon that side of the lead that was towards the stone:\r\n\r\n    ‘Hic jacet sepultus Rex Arturius in Insula Avalonia.’\r\n\r\nAnd digging nine foot deeper his body was discovered in the trunk of a\r\ntree, the bones of great bignesse, and in his scull perceived ten\r\nwounds, the last very great and plainly seene. His Queen Guinivere, that\r\nhad been neare kinswoman to Cador, Duke of Cornwall, a lady of passing\r\nbeauty, likewise lay by him, whose tresses of hair finely platted, and\r\nin colour like the gold, seemed perfect and whole untill it was touched,\r\nbut then, bewraying what all beauties are, shewed itself to be duste.”\r\n\r\nThe cross of lead with the inscription, as it was found and taken off\r\nthe stone, was kept in the Treasury, or Revester, of Glastonbury Church\r\ntill the suppression thereof in the reign of Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nThe bones of King Arthur and Queen Guinivere his wife were translated\r\ninto the great church, and “there in a faire Tombe of Marble his body\r\nwas laid, and his Queen’s at his feete, which noble monument among the\r\nfatall overthrowes of infinite more were altogether raced” [razed].[80]\r\n\r\nI scarcely know anything more pathetic than the old chronicler’s account\r\nof that tress of golden hair, the sole remains of the beauty that had\r\ncaptivated the heart of the great king and made his noblest knight to\r\nfall, and then the seeing it at a touch fall into dust. She who had\r\nmourned her sin at Amesbury, at last, by the loving hands of those who\r\nhad witnessed her penitence, was borne to rest beside her rightful lord;\r\nand the golden tresses which, when she had last seen him in life, swept\r\nthe dust at his feet, now, after more than six hundred years had passed\r\naway, faded into dust again when they had fulfilled their mission of\r\ntestifying to the main facts of the Legend of Arthur.\r\n\r\nNearly a hundred years again had passed, when in the year 1276 King\r\nEdward I. and his Queen Eleanor kept the Festival of Easter at\r\nGlastonbury. It was during the abbacy of John of Taunton, a great\r\nbenefactor to the Church in buildings, books for the library, and\r\nvestments, that this visit took place. So great were the privileges of\r\nthis place that even the king himself was laid under some restraint\r\nwhile abiding in it. His deputy high marshal was not allowed to exercise\r\nhis office; the king’s judges were held to have no authority; and even a\r\nman who had incurred the penalty of _læsa majestas_ was not allowed to\r\nbe punished. The mausoleum of black marble was opened for their\r\ninspection; the king’s bones were seen of gigantic proportion, the thigh\r\nbone the width of three fingers longer than that of the tallest monk\r\npresent. The tomb was ordered to be placed in front of the high altar;\r\nthe skulls of the king and queen to remain outside for the adoration of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nLeland, who saw the tomb, says: “At the head of Arthur’s tombe lay\r\nHenricus Abbas (Henry of Blois?)[81] and a crucifix; at the feet lay a\r\nfigure of Arthur; a cross on the tomb, and two lions at the head and two\r\nat the feet.”\r\n\r\nAnd here the hero’s bones rested till the Tyrant King scattered all such\r\nprecious relics to the winds. His body has _not_ been allowed to rest in\r\npeace, but his “name liveth for evermore.” Nor is Arthur’s fame confined\r\nto England alone, for amongst the figures that keep watch and ward round\r\nMaximilian’s tomb at Innspruck is one of the patriot king, and an\r\nexquisite photograph of him in armour, as he is there portrayed, faces\r\nthe writer as this attempt to show the connection of Arthur’s most\r\nheroic deeds with her own native county is being penned.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to add that the authorities for the above remarks are,\r\nGildas, Geoffry of Monmouth, William of Malmesbury, Giraldus Cambrensis,\r\nMallory’s “King Arthur,” Leland, Drayton’s “Polyolbion,” Speed, and\r\nCamden, “The Greatest of the Plantagenets,” and “Our Ancient Monuments\r\nand the Land around Them,” by C. P. Haines-Jackson, and lastly oral\r\nlegend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe History of Gilds.\r\n\r\nBY CORNELIUS WALFORD, F.S.S., _Barrister-at-Law_.\r\n\r\n_PART IV._\r\n\r\n(_Continued from p. 235._)\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.--_Gilds of Norfolk_--(_Continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nNORWICH.--The Gilds existing in this important city in 1388-9 were:--\r\n\r\n_Fraternity of St. Katerine_, commenced in 1307.--All the members of the\r\nGild were to go in procession on the day of St. Katherine, and make\r\nofferings; penalty on absent members. On the day following, mass, &c.\r\nBurial services to be attended and offerings made--the duties of the\r\nlettered and of the unlettered bretheren and sisteren specifically\r\ndefined. Bretheren dying within eight miles of the city to be brought in\r\nfor burial, or at least the usual services done. Poor bretheren to be\r\nhelped; and causes of quarrel to be laid before the Gild. Fine on\r\nrefusal to take office. A liveryhood to be worn, and all the members to\r\ndine together on the Gild-day. Admission of new members only by common\r\nconsent. Goods of the Gild enumerated.\r\n\r\n_The Tailors’ Gild_, founded 1350.--The Gild to meet together, and the\r\nnext day a mass of requiem. The bretheren to obey summons of Alderman to\r\naudit accounts; fine if absent. Meeting after Easter to choose officers,\r\n&c. Payments to be made to sexton and clerk; help to the poor and\r\nmaimed. Burial services and offerings, to extend to those dying within\r\nseven miles of the city. Service for those dying abroad. Oath to be\r\ntaken by Gild-members. Alderman to be chosen. At meetings a candle to be\r\nkept alight, and a prayer said. A summoner to be chosen, and requited by\r\nquittance of the usual payments.

The Gild had no land, but was maintained by the\r\ncharges levied under the Ordinances.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. Mary_, commenced in 1360.--It was of the Religious type.\r\nThe bretheren and sisteren of the Gild, as long as there should be\r\ntwelve of them living, were to provide a candle and torches, to be used\r\non certain festivals named “in wyrschipe of crist and his moder.” There\r\nis a note of the masters of the Gild and of the property in hand.\r\n\r\n_Fraternity of St. Trinity, in the Cathedral_, begun in 1364.--A solemn\r\nservice to be held on the eve of the Feast of the Trinity. A mass of\r\nrequiem shall be had, and offerings made. Burial services and offerings.\r\nHelp to poor bretheren. Fines for absence from meetings of Gild.

Help to those fallen into poverty or mishap, if not\r\nbrought about through folly or riotous living. Fine for non-fulfilment\r\nof Ordinances unless there be good excuse. Neither the King’s right nor\r\nthe law to be encroached upon. The Gild appears to have been entitled to\r\ngifts by certain masons--probably of another Gild.\r\n\r\n_Gild of the Peltyers_ [Furriers], founded 1376.--Two candles, dressed\r\nwith flowers, were to be yearly offered at St. William’s tomb, by a\r\nprocession of a boy and two good men. Only three excuses were to be\r\nallowed for non-attendance at mass, viz., being in “ye kyngges seruise,\r\ner for stronge sekenesse, or twenty myle duellynge fro yis syte,” unless\r\nit were otherwise willed. No Ordinance to prejudice the King’s right, or\r\nthe law. On the morrow of the Gild-day the Gild to hear a mass in\r\nrequiem; after the mass to go to an inn, audit accounts and choose\r\nofficers. The officers to be chosen by picked men. Bretheren or sisteren\r\nfallen into trouble or misease, to have weekly help; but not so if\r\nbrought on by their own folly. Fine on refusal to take office. Burial\r\nservices and offerings, extending to deaths within seven miles of the\r\ncity. An annual feast to be held. Fine for not attending meetings.\r\nAdmission of new-comers to be regulated by “ye Alderman and xij\r\nbretheryn.” The common bellman to summon the bretheren to meet on the\r\nmorrow of the Gild-day.

Help to those fallen poor, sick, or in other mischance. All dying\r\nwithin seven miles of the city to have burial services.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. Botulph_, founded 1384.--The meeting of the fraternity to\r\nbe held on the Sunday next after the Epiphany; next day they were to\r\nhave a mass of requiem. Burials to be attended by the bretheren, and\r\nofferings made. Help to the poor bretheren and sisteren was to be made\r\nby the members at the rate of “a ferthyng in ye woke.” The goods of the\r\nGild are enumerated.\r\n\r\n_Fraternity of St. Christopher_, founded 1384.--Prayer to be said at\r\nevery meeting for the Church, peace, Pope, Cardinals, “ye patriak of\r\nJerhusalem,” “for ye holy londe and ye holy crosse, yat godd for his\r\nmyght and his mercy bryng it oute of hethen power into reule of holy\r\nchirche,” archbishops, bishops, parsons, king, queen, dukes, earls,\r\nbarons, bachelors, knights, squires, citizens, burgesses, franklins,\r\ntillers, craftsmen, widows, maidens, wives, commonalities, ship-men,\r\npilgrims, unbelievers, our fathers’ and mothers’ souls, and for all of\r\nthis Gild. The Gild-day was to be on the Sunday before the Feast of St.\r\nChristopher. No Ordinance shall be against the common law. There was to\r\nbe a yearly mass of requiem, and offerings; also offerings at burials;\r\nand two poor men to carry torches. Poor bretheren were to be helped.\r\nThis was evidently a Gild of a higher order than many in this city.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. George_, founded 1385.--The day of St. George was always to\r\nbe kept, and offerings made on that day; next day a mass of requiem.\r\nBurial services to be attended by the bretheren, and offerings made.\r\nWeekly help to poor bretheren. Goods of the Gild enumerated.\r\n\r\n_The Saddlers’ and Spurriers’ Gild_, founded 1385.--The Ordinances to be\r\nkept so long as twelve of the Gild lived. Two torches to be kept burning\r\nat the elevation of the host at high mass. The Gild meeting to be held\r\non the first Sunday after Trinity, and the members to have a livery. All\r\nto meet the evening before to pray for their own souls. Next morning\r\nmass shall be heard, and offerings made, and all shall go in procession\r\nto the Nunnery of Carrow. On death within the city all shall be at the\r\ndirge, and two poor men with them. The same at interment; and offerings\r\nand gifts to be made. Service with the bretheren on death within three\r\nmiles of the city; and service on death of one dwelling beyond, at\r\nCarrow.\r\n\r\n_Brotherhood of Barbers._--Torches and other lights, &c., shall be\r\noffered on Midsummer-day. Torches were to be kept burning during high\r\nmass. The Gild appears to have been dedicated to “seynt John the\r\nBabtis.”\r\n\r\n=Oxenburghe= (_Oxburgh; Oxborough_).--There were eight Gilds in this town\r\n(now village) at the same date, of which the following may be taken as a\r\ntype:--\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. John Baptist_, founded 1307.--The officers, bretheren, and\r\nsisteren shall come to evensong on the day of St. John the Baptist, and\r\nmake offerings. Help to those “in trouble” was to be given at the rate\r\nof one farthing a day; one halfpenny on Sunday. Prayers for the dead.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. Peter_, founded 1378.--The members of the Gild to assemble\r\nat evensong on St. Peter’s Day, and make offerings. Help to those in\r\ntrouble--rate not distinctly specified. Fine for betraying the affairs\r\nof the Gild.\r\n\r\n=Wygnale= (_Wyggenale_, now _Wiggenshall_).--The Gilds existing in this\r\ntown or village, which was located near King’s Lynn and appears to have\r\nbeen of some importance, were:\r\n\r\n_Gild of the Assumption_, founded 1384.--Latin prayers to be said out of\r\nthe Church offices. English prayer of the Gild for the Church; for the\r\nKing, Queen, and Baronage; for the Pope and the Patriarch; for the Holy\r\nLand; for the fruit of the earth; for ship-men and travellers; for the\r\nfounders of the Gild; and for the souls of the dead and living. Search\r\nto be made for anyone dying suddenly, by water or by land: and he shall\r\nhave burial services. Any one belying another shall be fined.\r\n\r\n_Gild of the Holy Trinity._--Latin prayers shall be said out of church\r\noffices. Burials at the cost of the Gild. Drowned men shall be searched\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n_Gild de Cranbone_, founded 1387.--Latin prayers to be said out of\r\nChurch offices. English prayer of the Gild for the Church, Pope,\r\nCardinals, Patriarch, Archbishop of Canterbury, and other Bishops; King\r\nand Queen, and the commoners of the realm. Burials at cost of Gild.\r\nEvery quarrel to be brought before two bretheren. Two meetings shall be\r\nheld every year.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. Trinity_, founded 1387.--Four meetings shall be held every\r\nyear, at which payments to be made for lights.\r\n\r\n_Gild of St. Peter._--Two meetings shall be held every year. All shall\r\ngo to church with a garland of oak leaves. Service for the dead, and\r\nofferings. Bread to be given, and masses sung for the souls of the dead.\r\nMen dying by water or land to be searched for and buried. Meat and drink\r\nto be given at yearly meeting. The funds of the Gild then (1388)\r\nconsisted of 11s.\r\n\r\n=Great Yarmouth.=--King John in his Charter to this borough, granted 1209,\r\ngave the privilege of a Merchant Gild to be held in this town. We have\r\nnot met with any very early records of it. But in the 6th Elizabeth\r\n(1563) there are notices, which, however, only go to show the nature of\r\nthe annual entertainment given. A few items will prove instructive:\r\n\r\nFebruary 28.--“Order’d that the merchant’s dinner, or feast of late\r\ncalled the Trinity Brotherhood, shall be rected and heyned this present\r\nyear to come, and so forth to continue until further orders be taken.”\r\nCertain persons were named to order the feast and estimate the cost, &c.\r\n\r\nMarch 18.--“Imprimis, every brother to pay for hym and hys wyffe,\r\nwhether they came or not, 2s. 8d. Every brother and syster\r\nextraordinary, 1s. If they wyl be bretherene, to pay bretherene lyke.”\r\n\r\n“The order of the drynkyn and dynner in the evening prayer, viz., spice\r\ncake, good bere.”\r\n\r\n  “Sunday dynner:--\r\n    Fromety    }                   Capon   }\r\n    Rost bysse } the first         Pyggs   } the second\r\n    Grene gese } course.           Lambe   } course.”\r\n    Weale      }                   Costard }\r\n\r\n“Sunday soper.--Good brothe with boyled mete. Rostyd mutton, capon,\r\nlambe tarte.”\r\n\r\n“Monday dynner.--Fromety, rosted bysse, grene gese, lamb.”\r\n\r\n“Note, that six persons to every mese; two grene gese to every mese, and\r\na capon to mese. The person appointed to heyn the feast refusing, to pay\r\n£10 to his successor to buy things necessary.”\r\n\r\nManship in his “History of Yarmouth” says that this regulation continued\r\ntill the year 1569, when, by reason of the excessive charge, but more\r\nespecially the great disorders of the common people, &c., it was agreed\r\nby an Act of the Assembly in the 11th Elizabeth, that from henceforth\r\nthe heynors who shall yearly be appointed to heyn the feast called\r\nTrinity Brotherhood, shall be at their choice to heyn the said feast in\r\nreasonable order, or else to pay 4 nobles (26s. 8d.) apiece for the use\r\nof the town; which sum was paid yearly for many years afterwards, but at\r\nlast entirely dropt.\r\n\r\nSwinden (“History of Yarmouth”) says that in 33 Henry VIII. (1542) at an\r\nassembly holden in the common hall, on the Tuesday next after the feast\r\nof St. Faith, the following order was made: “That every as well of the\r\nfour and twenties as of the eight and forties should pay yearly towards\r\nthe finding of the Trinity mass priest at the Guild-day, 4d.”\r\n\r\nManship gives the following additional particulars regarding the old\r\nGuild-hall in Yarmouth: “There is a very fair building commonly called\r\nthe Guild-hall, near unto the church, containing in length from east to\r\nwest within the walls 76 feet, and in breadth 22 feet, which being much\r\nruinated, was in the year of our Lord God 1544 (in the 33 Henry VIII.)\r\nby the town very substantially repaired and amended, and the walls new\r\nbuttressed and supported, and the roof, which is a very fair one,\r\nsometime belonging to Mettingham College [near Bungay], upon the\r\nsuppression thereof, was brought to Yarmouth, and placed upon the said\r\nHall, and covered with lead very neatly. In this hall in times past,\r\nviz., within my remembrance [he wrote probably about the end of the\r\nreign of Elizabeth], was yearly holden on Trinity Sunday a Solemn Feast\r\nfor the whole Brotherhood and Fellowship of the Society, called the\r\nBlessed Trinity, which by our Charter of King John in the year 1207, was\r\ngranted unto us by the name of the Merchants Guild, whereunto every one\r\nof this Common Council, at his first admission and oath taken, doth\r\nstill acknowledge himself a brother of that Society. Which said feast\r\nwas for the most part yearly holden at the costs of four of that\r\nBrotherhood successively according to their course of incoming,\r\nmaintained; over whom the senior bailiff for the year presiding was and\r\nis nominated Alderman. The Hall aforesaid being at that time richly\r\nhanged and adorned with cloth of arras, tapestry, and other costly\r\nfurniture, not sparing any dainty fare which might be had for money.”\r\n\r\n“At which Feast all private quarrels and emulations were heard and ended\r\nin the glory of God and mutual love amongst neighbours: for which cause,\r\nin the primitive time of the Church, such Gilds or Fraternities were by\r\nthe laws Ecclesiastical ordained, and by the laws civil, among all\r\nChristian common-weals, used, practised, and confirmed.”\r\n\r\n(_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n     IT is proposed to enlarge or reconstruct the ancient Church of\r\n     Portskewet, Monmouthshire. The building is in sound condition, and\r\n     with its remarkable old churchyard cross is a most venerable and\r\n     picturesque object. Harold had a palace at Portskewet, and Mr.\r\n     Freeman is inclined to believe not only that he was the founder of\r\n     a church there, but that the existing structure is substantially\r\n     his erection (see “Journal of British Archæological Association,”\r\n     vol. x.). The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings will\r\n     do well to watch the proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHam.\r\n\r\n_THE SUFFIX “HAM” NOT EXCLUSIVELY DERIVED FROM A TEUTONIC SOURCE, BUT\r\nOCCASIONALLY ALSO FROM THE CELTIC._\r\n\r\nBY JAMES HURLY PRING, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a former volume of THE ANTIQUARIAN MAGAZINE (vol. iii. p. 127) I\r\npointed out that the place-name _Hampton_ did not necessarily represent\r\nthe Saxon “_home-town_,” as has so generally, yet erroneously, been\r\nassumed, but that the name is frequently derived also from _Avon_ or\r\nrather _Afon_, the Celtic word for water or a river, and that it ought,\r\ntherefore, strictly to be _Afonton_.\r\n\r\nIt was shown that this latter view was maintained by Camden, in evidence\r\nof which he cites Leland to prove that Hampton Court was anciently\r\ncalled Avon, as it appears in quoting from him the following lines:--\r\n\r\n      “Est locus insolito rerum splendore superbus\r\n       Alluiturque vagâ Tamisini fluminis undâ;\r\n       Nomine ab antiquo jam tempore dictus Avona.”\r\n    “Where Father Thames his gentle stream rolls on,\r\n     Avona called, an ancient name it bears.”\r\n              GOUGH’S _Camden_, vol. ii. p. 78.\r\n\r\nHere, then, and throughout the paper referred to, it will be seen that\r\n_Ham_ is presented to us chiefly, if not solely, in its aspect as a\r\nprefix.\r\n\r\nIt is now my intention to proceed to consider it more especially as a\r\nsuffix, in which use the instances of it are far more numerous than\r\nthose in which it is employed as a prefix.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, then, as a suffix to be almost universally regarded as\r\nrepresenting the Saxon “home,” and even Isaac Taylor himself gives no\r\nother than a Teutonic derivation for it.\r\n\r\nTrue it is that in this derivation he makes a distinction, dividing it\r\ninto the two forms of hăm and hām, maintaining that the former signifies\r\nan enclosure, whilst the latter is “the Home.” Without venturing to\r\nquestion the accuracy of this distinction, it is to be regretted that\r\n(except, indeed, so far as may be guessed at from its associations) it\r\nleaves us without any rule whereby we may be enabled to distinguish the\r\nhām, the _geheim_ or home, from hăm an enclosure; whilst, as just\r\nstated, Taylor altogether omits to notice that there is yet another\r\ndistinct source from which “ham” is derived, which is indeed in no\r\nrespect Teutonic, but is clearly to be referred to the Celtic, as\r\ninsisted upon both by Camden and by Leland.\r\n\r\nThe instances in which the termination-_ham_ must be thus referred to\r\nthe Celtic (as a Saxon corruption of the word _Afon_) are well marked\r\nand are by no means rare, and it is possible that some of those which\r\nhave been regarded as examples of hăm, an enclosure, may be found to\r\nbelong rather to the Celtic derivation from Afon. As an illustration of\r\n_ham_ in the latter aspect, I will at once refer to the class of\r\nexamples of the word which is furnished by those large tracts of country\r\nwhich are or formerly were liable to inundation from the occasional\r\noverflow of some adjacent river (afon), and which have accordingly\r\nreceived the appellation of “hams”--that is, rich low-lying lands in the\r\nvicinity of rivers.\r\n\r\nThese extensive tracts of marsh-land cannot be supposed, especially at\r\nthe very early period when the name of _ham_ was imposed upon them, to\r\nhave represented “an enclosure,” whilst their general character, and\r\ntheir liability to be frequently flooded, alike forbid the notion that\r\nthe name of ham in this case was originally associated with a “home or\r\ndwelling.”\r\n\r\nEach of these “hams,” then, I apprehend must be held to furnish a marked\r\nexample of the derivation of its name from the Celtic Avon, as it will\r\nbe found that the distinctive feature of _a river_ is present in each of\r\nthem, and in one case the river even still retains the original Celtic\r\nname of _Avon_.\r\n\r\nAs examples of some instances of the name occurring on the banks of the\r\nrivers in Somerset, we have the Loxton _Hams_, the Berrow _Hams_, the\r\nPaulet _Hams_ with Otter_ham_pton, which latter name, assuming its\r\nderivation to be Teutonic, should be the “_Otter’s home-town_”!\r\nBiddis_ham_, Burn_ham_, and Lymps_ham_, the latter being the ancient\r\nLyn-pils-ham, the rich pasture land by the creek of the Lyn or the River\r\nAxe, with many others.\r\n\r\nPassing now into Devonshire we come upon the North _Hams_, and the South\r\n_Hams_--names which in this case cannot be held to represent either\r\nhomes or enclosures, whilst _water_ or _rivers_ will be found to be\r\nconspicuously present in both instances.\r\n\r\nIn his review of “Risdon’s Survey of Devon,” 1785, Chapple refers to the\r\nNorth and South Hams as being “ancient names,” and states that the\r\ncounty of Devon had originally a _threefold_ division, anciently known\r\nby the names of _East_, _South_, and _North Hams_ (p. 116). This,\r\nhowever, is the only notice I have seen of the _East Hams_.\r\n\r\nAs one of the places comprehended in the district of the _North Hams_,\r\nwe have Little_ham_, which Risdon regards as “Little Home,”\r\nassuming-_ham_ in this case “to signify the same with home or\r\nhabitation.”\r\n\r\nBut there is no reason to regard either this or Park_ham_ or any of the\r\nother instances of the terminal-_ham_ which are found here, as being\r\nreferable to a Teutonic source, any more than is the case with the hams\r\nin Somerset, and as regards the instance of Nort_ham_ itself, it is\r\ninteresting to note that (except the omitted _ton_) we have here the\r\nactual name of Northam[p]ton, in which Camden expressly insists that the\r\n_ham_ is _afon_.\r\n\r\nIf we now proceed to the South Hams, we reach an extensive tract of land\r\npresenting the same characteristic features as those generally observed\r\nin connection with the name of _Ham_, where it occurs in the situations\r\nalready alluded to, and which do not correspond either to an enclosure\r\nor a home.\r\n\r\nWe find it, for example, stated in Chapple that “about Teignmouth,\r\nDartmouth, Totness, Modbury, Plymouth, Ashburton, and all those parts of\r\nthe country which are called the South Hams, the lands are generally of\r\na different kind from any of the former,” &c. (p. 20). Now it is\r\nmanifest that such an extensive tract of country as that to which the\r\nterm “South Hams” is here applied cannot possibly claim to be regarded\r\nin the light of a home, or an enclosure.\r\n\r\nOn investigating more closely the district known as the _South Hams_, it\r\nwill be found to possess many points of special interest.\r\n\r\nHere the name _Ham_, as associated with the presence of _rivers_,\r\nreceives abundant illustration; a considerable portion of the South Hams\r\nlying between the rivers Dart and Erme, and through the centre of this\r\nruns the River _Avon_, which by its name lends confirmation to the view\r\nhere maintained as to the occasional derivation of the name of Ham from\r\nthe Celtic. Along the course of this river it will be seen that the\r\nnames of _ham_ and _avon_ seem almost to alternate, or are at least\r\npromiscuously intermingled, thus affording additional evidence of their\r\nbeing cognate to each other, and of their common origin.\r\n\r\nWe have, for example, the name of _Ham_ alone, and of _Aveton_\r\n(_Avon-ton_) alone, of _Aveton_ (_Avon-ton_) Gifford, of Bickham,\r\n_Topsham_ Bridge, Hend_ham_, and further on of _Avon_neigh, and lastly\r\nof Bant_ham_, occurring at the very mouth of the _Avon_.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of considerable interest in connection with the South\r\nHams of Devon, and pointing in a direction confirmatory of the views\r\nhere advanced, is the fact that the Cornu-British language continued in\r\nuse in this district long after it had ceased to be spoken in the other\r\nparts of the surrounding country. This fact is noticed by Polwhele both\r\nin his “Historical Views of Devonshire,” 1791, and in his “History of\r\nCornwall,” whilst Drew affirms that the Cornu-British was spoken here in\r\nthe time of Edward I. (1272-1307). It is deserving of notice also that\r\nan interesting note by F. W. P. Jago in reference to this question has\r\nlately appeared in the second volume of the “Western Antiquary” (pp.\r\n202, 203).\r\n\r\nWithout intending by any means to question the fact that in numerous\r\ninstances the terminal-_ham_ is derived from the Teutonic, and rightly\r\nbears the meaning of “home,” “habitation,” or “enclosure,” I deem it\r\ndesirable, whilst on this subject, to draw attention to an interesting\r\nremark in reference to it which has been made by so high an authority as\r\nMr. Benjamin Thorpe. In commenting on the fact that the Kentish kingdom\r\nwas founded by adventurers from _Jutland_ (if not actually by Hengist\r\nand Horsa), Mr. Thorpe proceeds to observe: “The termination-_ham_, so\r\ncommon in Kent and elsewhere in England, corresponding to the German\r\n_heim_, does _not appear in Jutland_, so far as my means enable me to\r\nascertain.”[82]\r\n\r\nThe very general, indeed the almost universal reference of “ham” to a\r\nTeutonic origin, seems to invest this observation by Thorpe with\r\npeculiar interest, and I would venture accordingly to commend its\r\nconsideration to all those who can discover in “ham” nothing else than\r\nthe Saxon “heim,” “home,” or “dwelling.”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it must at once be admitted that the derivation of\r\n“ham” from the Celtic _Afon_ has received little or no recognition from\r\nthe days of Camden down to the present time. In regarding it, however,\r\nfrom this point of view, enough it is presumed has now been said to\r\nrescue it for the future from this neglect, and to establish its title,\r\nin many cases at least, to be rightly and legitimately referred to the\r\nCeltic, as here contended for.\r\n\r\n     AMONG the “South Kensington Art Handbooks” now in course of\r\n     preparation is one on the “Saracenic Art of Egypt,” by Mr. Stanley\r\n     Lane-Poole.\r\n\r\n     IT is reported that there are only five genuine signatures of\r\n     Shakespeare in existence. “From this it is inferred,” writes the\r\n     _San Francisco News Letter_, “that the Bard of Avon did not make a\r\n     practice of endorsing his friends’ notes--another evidence of his\r\n     good sense.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCollectanea.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS-EVE IN DEVONSHIRE.--In Devonshire is still observed on\r\nChristmas-Eve an ancient custom, which is supposed to ensure a good crop\r\nof apples. The farm-servants procure an ash-fagot, round which they\r\ncarefully put as many binds as possible, because they are rewarded with\r\ncups of cider equivalent in number to the binds which encircle the\r\nfagot. The fagot is then placed on the fire, and as each bind bursts\r\nthey claim a cup of cider; they have also a bowl of toast and cider\r\nwhich they take into the orchard, and, putting a piece of toast on the\r\nking or principal apple-tree, repeat the following lines:--\r\n\r\n    “Apple-tree, we wassail thee,\r\n     To bear and to blow apples enow,\r\n     Hats full, caps full,\r\n     Three bushel bags full,\r\n           Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!”\r\n\r\nIt appears that exactly the same words are not always used on this\r\noccasion, a different version being given in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_\r\nfor 1791.\r\n\r\nTANTIVY.--According to Harrod’s _History of Stamford_, the origin of\r\nthis sporting cry is to be sought in the name of St. Tibba, who lived as\r\nan anchoritess at Ryhall, near Stamford, and died and was buried there.\r\nAccording to Camden, she was the patroness of hawking, fowling, and\r\nother sports, like the Roman Diana. She was a relative of Penda, King of\r\nMercia, and lived a holy life at Godmanchester, in Hunts, before she\r\nwent to Ryhall. Stukely says that her cell was at the north-west corner\r\nof the outside of Ryhall Church. She is thus commemorated by Drayton in\r\nhis _Polyolbion_:--\r\n\r\n                “And to _these_ St. Tibba let us call,\r\n    In solitude to Christ that pass’d her whole delight,\r\n    In Godmanchester made her an anchorite,\r\n    Among which of that house for saints that reckon’d be,\r\n    Yet never anymore gracèd the same than she.”\r\n\r\nCURIOUS INVENTORY.--The following, from the original in my hands, may\r\ninterest some of your City readers: “An inventary of the goodes creditte\r\nand debtes of Thomas Potter, late of the parishe of St. Nicholas Acon,\r\nof the Citie of London, salter, deceased.

By EDWARD WALFORD, M.A. Cassell & Co.\r\n     1884.\r\n\r\nTHE above-mentioned firm must be congratulated on the very able manner\r\nin which they have performed their part in the production of the volume\r\nbefore us; for obvious reasons, it is not for us to speak of the\r\neditor’s share in the work, further than to state that he has\r\nconscientiously tried to perform the task which he had undertaken. This\r\nvolume, which completes the work of “Greater London,” comprises the\r\nwhole of that portion of the metropolitan police area, outside the\r\nlimits of the Board of Works, which is on the south side of the Thames,\r\nextending from Erith in the east to Kingston and Esher in the west, and\r\nembracing within its scope the important towns of Woolwich, Chislehurst,\r\nBromley, Croydon, Epsom, Richmond, Kew, and Wimbledon, together with the\r\nseveral smaller parishes, villages and hamlets, that lie within its\r\narea. This area, almost every nook and corner of which--thanks to our\r\nrailway system--may be visited on the Saturday afternoon holidays in\r\nsummer, and most of them even in winter, contains, as we need hardly\r\nadd, much that may interest the ordinary visitor, should he care for\r\nquiet and peaceful rural scenery, or the artist who may be in search of\r\nchoice “bits.” Mansions and other buildings will be found possessing\r\nhistorical associations: such, for instance, as Chislehurst, with its\r\nmemories of the antiquary Camden, and the Emperor Louis Napoleon; Hayes\r\nand Keston, the favourite haunts of Pitt and Wilberforce; Beddington,\r\nwhere we find the Carews and Sir Walter Raleigh; Croydon, where there is\r\nmuch to read about in the long roll of primates who have occupied the\r\npalace there till Addington became their home; Epsom, where we see “the\r\nquality” drinking the waters, and Lord Derby and his friends\r\ninaugurating those races whose name is not only national, but\r\nworld-wide. In the chapters devoted to Richmond and its neighbourhood\r\nthe reader is placed in contact with bygone English sovereigns and\r\nprinces and princesses; here, too, he is surrounded by Kitty Clive, Gay,\r\nThomson, and a host of children of the Muses. Indeed, from end to end of\r\nthe volume the reader is brought face to face with great men and women\r\nwho have added a light to the pages of English history. It only remains\r\nto add that the work possesses a copious index, and that it is profusely\r\nillustrated, engravings being given, not only of places as they exist in\r\nthe present day, but also of historical buildings which have long since\r\nbeen swept away. Of these we may mention Nonsuch Palace, near Cheam, and\r\nthe Old Palace at Richmond, which latter, through the kindness of\r\nMessrs. Cassell, we are enabled to reproduce.\r\n\r\n     _Calendar of State Papers: Colonial, East Indies, 1625-1629._\r\n     (Rolls Series.) Longman & Co. 1884.\r\n\r\nMR. SAINSBURY has brought out a fourth volume of the “Calendar of East\r\nIndia State Papers,” which, in point of intrinsic interest and editorial\r\ntreatment, will suffer by comparison with none of its predecessors. Any\r\nauthoritative compilation, dealing with the vast collection of materials\r\navailable for the history of British Colonies in their official\r\nrelations with the parent State, is sure to command the widest interest;\r\nand such a work, when treating of the early and truly wayward fortune of\r\nthe mighty national stake contained in our Indian Empire, should be\r\npeculiarly attractive to the countrymen of Clive and Warren Hastings.\r\n\r\nThe original documents calendered in the present volume consist, as\r\nbefore, chiefly of the Court minutes of the East India Company, domestic\r\nState papers and correspondence, original correspondence, East India\r\nState papers, and Holland correspondence. The light which these combine\r\nto throw upon the contemporary history of our greatest trading community\r\nis sometimes almost painfully intense.\r\n\r\nThe Company in 1625 was in truth placed in both a dangerous and a\r\nhelpless position. The Amboyne massacre of three years before was as yet\r\nnot only unpunished, but almost unreproved, except by the voice of\r\npopular indignation in England. We may, in fact, estimate the inaction\r\nof the Government to a certain extent in proportion to the violence of\r\nthis outcry against “that most bloody and treacherous villainy.” It was\r\nin the spring of this year (1625), we read here, that the crisis\r\nprovoked by official supineness was reached, a popular outbreak against\r\nDutch residents being apprehended on the approaching Shrove Tuesday.\r\nThis movement had been fanned by certain incendiary pamphlets; by a\r\npicture, and by a play, each reflecting strongly upon the inhumanity of\r\nthe Dutch towards English traders. The picture, in especial, appears to\r\nhave been a masterpiece of animosity, for therein was “lively, largely,\r\nand artificially” set forth the interior of the supposed Torture Chamber\r\nat Amboyne. Now that a tardy justice was about to be dealt to the\r\njudicial murderers of their fellows, the Company was content to permit\r\nthe picture itself to be suppressed. Yet that the members were secretly\r\nproud of their manifesto is apparent from their naïve regret that “His\r\nMajesty and their Lordships” had not been “presented with a view of this\r\nhorrid spectacle.” Owing to the precautions of the Council, the fateful\r\nday passed without an outbreak, but none the less, as the editor justly\r\nobserves, the sore rankled long in the hearts of true-born Englishmen.\r\nAt length reprisals were instituted, and three Dutch ships were arrested\r\nat Portsmouth, only to be released, in return, as the popular rumour\r\nwent, for a secret bribe of three tons of gold. Finally, the dispute was\r\nallowed to drag out its slow length in diplomatic correspondence, and a\r\nparty-trial in Holland.\r\n\r\nThe remaining features of interest in this volume are connected with the\r\nprivate details of the Company’s financial ventures, and these reveal a\r\nstate of affairs most melancholy to contemplate. To such a depth of\r\npoverty had the once flourishing Company sunk, that in 1629, with a debt\r\nof £300,000 already incurred, the Governor was compelled to confess\r\ntheir inability to advance £10,000 to the Crown towards the expenses of\r\nthe French War. At the same time, too, every investment in the Far East\r\nturned out disastrously. The Dutch not only pillaged English factories\r\nwith impunity, but openly thwarted any chance of carrying on a lucrative\r\ntrade, by forcing their own spices upon English factors at ruinous\r\nprices. Moreover, the constitutions of our countrymen too often\r\nsuccumbed to the pestilential swamps and jungles of New Holland. Then\r\nthe natives, as usual an unreliable element, both broke their contracts\r\nand ill-treated the Company’s factors, in spite of their “accursed oaths\r\nto the contrary.” Yet in the end British constancy and enterprise\r\nprevailed. Fresh subscriptions poured in, new ships were fitted out, and\r\nreturned laden with ample wealth. The English merchantmen stoutly held\r\ntheir own against the Dutch pirates, and beat them off--one ship (the\r\n_Lion_) against ten--in an action that recalled the glories of Grenville\r\nand his _Revenge_. Therefore it will be seen that this volume closes\r\nwith a happier augury of renewed peace and prosperity.\r\n\r\n     _Doctor Johnson: His Life, Works and Table Talk._ (Centenary\r\n     edition.) T. Fisher Unwin. 1884.\r\n\r\nIT was inevitable that the Centenary of Dr. Johnson’s death should\r\nrecall into existence some at least of his contributions to English\r\nliterature, and Mr. Unwin has done well in publishing at this moment a\r\nchoice selection from the “burly Doctor’s” works, under the above title.\r\nThe little _brochure_ on our table by no means exhausts that mine of\r\nwealth which is to be found in the writings of Dr. Johnson; but, so far\r\nas it goes, it is carefully and conscientiously selected, and ought to\r\nbe most welcome to his many admirers.\r\n\r\n_Johnsoniana._ Arranged by R. W. Montagu. Boot & Son. 1884.\r\n\r\nA MOST appropriate and well-timed collection of the best of Dr.\r\nJohnson’s sayings and opinions, gleaned not only from Boswell but from\r\nother sources. These are arranged in chapters under separate headings.\r\nIs it by accident, or by set purpose, we wonder, that one chapter is\r\ndevoted to “Love, Friendship, and Affection,” and another to “Marriage”?\r\nThe life of Johnson prefixed to this little volume is a happy model of\r\ncondensation. Published at a shilling, it ought to command just now a\r\nvery large sale.\r\n\r\n_Pottery and Porcelaìn._ By F. LITCHFIELD. Bickers. 1884.\r\n\r\nTHIS is a most useful manual for the collector of old china and articles\r\nof _vertu_, a guide based on long and large practical experience. The\r\nbook is partly historic, and the chapters on “Ancient Pottery” and “The\r\nMediæval and Renaissance Periods” will be perhaps the most interesting\r\nto our readers. But those whose tastes are more modern than antiquarian\r\nwill derive more pleasure from the chapters relating the story of the\r\nintroduction of porcelain into Europe; while nobody, however large his\r\nor her own experience may be, can afford to despise or to dispense with\r\nthe lists of the marks and monograms adopted by the Wedgwoods, the\r\nSpodes, the Copelands, and other manufacturers of pottery, or with the\r\n“hints and cautions to collectors” to be found on pp. 191-199. The\r\nillustrations are numerous and excellent; and the little work can boast\r\nthe merit of a very careful index.\r\n\r\n_Phallicism._ By HARGRAVE JENNINGS. G. Redway. 1884.\r\n\r\nThis book is written _ad clerum_, and appeals to the scholar only, and\r\nnot to the multitude. It is a masterly and exhaustive account of that\r\nworship of the creative powers of nature which, under various names, has\r\nprevailed among all the nations of antiquity and of mediæval times,\r\nalike in Egypt and India, in Italy and Gaul, among the Israelites of\r\nold, and among the primitive inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland.\r\nMr. Jennings treats of his subject in its celestial and terrestrial, its\r\nheathen and Christian aspects; and he traces its connection with the\r\nGnostics, the Buddhists, and the Rosicrucians. He sees Phallicism in the\r\nobelisks and pyramids of the Nile, in the monolithic circles of\r\nStonehenge and of Avebury, and in the Round Towers of Ireland. A worship\r\nor cult so ancient and so widely spread, it is clear, must have a\r\nhistory, and a curious one; and this Mr. Jennings has traced in a way so\r\nscholarly as to leave little or nothing to be said by others. He has\r\ncarried his inquiry much further back, and also in many more countries,\r\nthan all previous writers, including Mr. R. P. Knight, who drew his\r\npictures of Phallic worship chiefly from what he had himself witnessed\r\nin Italy and the South of France. It will surprise very many of our\r\nreaders to learn that the erection of the Tower of Babel was probably an\r\nearly outburst of this worship, and that its hidden and mystic meaning\r\nwas the same as that of the Round Towers in “the sister island,” which\r\nwere nothing more or less than fire towers, expressive of the ancient\r\nfaith of the Parsees. How far these speculations are true in fact, must\r\nbe left to the learned to decide. But certainly the work before us will\r\nbe found a most valuable auxiliary to all who care to pursue such a\r\nsubject of inquiry, a subject for which Mr. Jennings is the better\r\nfitted on account of his long and intimate acquaintance with the\r\nRosicrucians, their tenets, and their practices. The issue of the work\r\nis limited to 400 copies for English subscribers.\r\n\r\n     _Benvenuto Cellini. Nouvel Appendice, aux recherches sur son\r\n     Œuvre et sur les Pièces qui lui sont attribuées._ Par E. PLON.\r\n     4to. Paris: Plon, Nourrit et Cie.\r\n\r\nOUR readers may perhaps remember that some time ago we reviewed M.\r\nEugène Plon’s magnificent volume on Benvenuto Cellini.[83] From the\r\nextreme care with which the work was done, it was quite evident that we\r\nhad before us the result of enthusiastic sympathy with the artist whose\r\nbiography we were invited to study, and whose genius was so thoroughly\r\nappreciated. M. Plon would not take a final leave of his hero, and every\r\nfresh discovery referring to him would be duly recorded and given to the\r\npublic. Nor have we been disappointed of our expectation, for the quarto\r\n_brochure_ of which we have just transcribed the title-page, is an\r\ninteresting contribution to the history of art in general, and of\r\nBenvenuto Cellini in particular. It consists of two parts, which we\r\nshall briefly notice in succession.\r\n\r\n     “Following the example of Orsino, surnamed Il Cervaicolo, and of so\r\n     many masters belonging to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it\r\n     might be supposed that Benvenuto Cellini, also, had left behind him\r\n     portraits in coloured wax, such as we often meet now in public\r\n     museums and private collections. Comparing an entry forming part of\r\n     the inventory drawn up after the artist’s death (‘due scatolini di\r\n     ritratti del Serenissimo Principe Abbozzati,’) with a memorandum of\r\n     works executed for the Cardinal di Ravenna (‘e per uno suo ritratto\r\n     grande di cera’), we had conjectured this to be the case, and our\r\n     hypothesis derived a certain kind of countenance from the fact that\r\n     Lastri notices (Osservatore Fiorentino, Firenza, 1758) a portrait\r\n     in wax of Alessandro di Medici, hung up as a votive offering in the\r\n     Church della Nunziata, and which was ascribed to Benvenuto. Our\r\n     presumption has now become a reality, thanks to the discovery of a\r\n     portrait of Francesco di Medici, which we reproduce. It is in\r\n     coloured wax, and rather high relief on a dark back-ground.”\r\n\r\nThis description is M. Eugène Plon’s. He further informs us in a\r\nfootnote that the portrait in question, originally preserved at Prato,\r\nis now at Florence, and belongs to the collection of the Commendatore\r\nLuigi Vai; its existence was pointed out to our author by the Director\r\nof the State Paper Office of Tuscany, Commendatore Cesare Guasti; it was\r\nintended for the celebrated Bianca Capello, to whom Francesco di Medici\r\nforwarded it, together with this short note:--\r\n\r\n     “AMATA BIANCA,--\r\n\r\n     “Fino da Pisa il mio ritratto u’ invio che ’l nostro maestro\r\n     Cellini m’a fatto in cera. Il mio chore prendete.\r\n\r\nD. FRANCISCO.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt whatever, therefore, on the authenticity of this\r\nportrait. M. Plon has had it photographed in the original size, and it\r\nis impossible to imagine anything more exquisite as a work of art. With\r\nreference to the date, it must be assigned between 1568 and 1570, for we\r\nknow that Benvenuto Cellini died in the beginning of 1571, and about the\r\nclose of the preceding year he complained of suffering from a severe\r\nbronchial attack, which had obliged him to discontinue work for the\r\nspace of several weeks.\r\n\r\nM. Plon has taken the opportunity afforded by the portrait to give us a\r\nshort sketch of the life of Bianca Capello, her first marriage with\r\nPietro Bonaventuri, the romantic adventures which followed upon it, and\r\nher subsequent relations with Francesco di Medici. He has added to his\r\ninteresting memoir two portraits of Bianca: one by Angiolo Bronzino,\r\npreserved in the Uffizi Gallery; the other likewise by Angiolo Bronzino,\r\nexhibited in that of the Palazzo Pitti.\r\n\r\nThe second part of M. Plon’s supplement or appendix is devoted to an\r\naccount of several works of art ascribed to Benvenuto Cellini. We first\r\nmeet with a statue of the god Pluto, belonging to a London _virtuoso_,\r\nand which was exhibited at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1879. It is\r\nsupposed to have been cast in the Petit-Nesle foundry, and to have been\r\noriginally one of the twelve _Dii Majores_ ordered by Francis I., and\r\nwhich were to have been worked in silver as decorations for his\r\nfestivals. There is nothing to prove that we have here a production of\r\nBenvenuto Cellini, but it certainly belongs to the school of Michael\r\nAngelo, and if the artist is not Cellini he must be Giovanni di Bologna.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to notice is a large basin of silver-gilt workmanship,\r\nbelonging to Lord Cowper, and the ewer corresponding to which is\r\ndescribed and reproduced in M. Plon’s first volume; it represents a\r\nseries of scenes from the Old Testament. “The richness and elegance of\r\nthe compositions,” says our author, “betray the hand of a first-rate\r\nartist.” Let us add that both the statue of Pluto previously mentioned\r\nand the present basin have found a place amongst the illustrations of\r\nthe work we are now reviewing.\r\n\r\nTwo other articles of _vertu_ (two cups, or rather their mountings) are\r\nalso ascribed as probably Cellini’s work, on the authority of M. Alfred\r\nDarcel (letter to M. Edmond Bonnaffé, in the _Chronique des Arts et de\r\nla Curiosité_, April 14, 1883). We have further to mention two gold\r\njewels intended to be worn on a man’s cap (_nella berretta_), and which\r\nwere engraved by Cellini’s rival, Caradosso. This naturally leads M.\r\nPlon to insert a letter addressed by our artist to Isabella d’Este,\r\nDuchess of Mantua, a letter in which he adds further details to those he\r\nhad already given (see _Benvenuto Cellini_) on Caradosso.\r\n\r\nThe last description we have to allude to here is that of a salt-cellar,\r\nwhich appears to have been made for Frederigo II., Duke of Mantua, and\r\nwhich was a work of high art. M. Plon gives us the correspondence\r\nrelating to it, correspondence preserved in the archives of the Gonzaga\r\nfamily, and which has been copied there by M. Armand Baschet, who has so\r\noften and in so remarkable a manner contributed to our knowledge of the\r\nsocial, political, and intellectual history of Italy during the\r\nsixteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this elegant _brochure_ is an important and necessary\r\nappendix to the volume we reviewed last year; it may be regarded as not\r\nonly a supplement to M. Plon’s _catalogue raisonné_ of Benvenuto\r\nCellini’s work, but a memoir of Bianca Capella, and a graphic though far\r\nfrom edifying sketch of Italian life at the time of the Reformation.\r\n\r\n_English Etchings_, Parts xli. and xlii. (D. Bogue, 27, King\r\nWilliam-street, W.C.), which are now before us, are fully up to the\r\nstandard of the parts previously published. Among the plates calling\r\nfor special mention in these pages is an interesting addition to the\r\nseries of etchings of Old London, “Covent Garden Market,” by Mr. A. W.\r\nWilliams. Orleton Church, Herefordshire, a spirited etching by Mr.\r\nOliver Baker, shows the fine Jacobean pulpit of oak, covered with\r\nelaborate carving, and part of the chancel arch with the head of a\r\nbishop in mitre and amice as a drip-stone termination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObituary Memoirs.\r\n\r\n    “Emori nolo; sed me esse mortuum nihil æstimo.”--_Epicharmus._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REV. HUGH PIGOT, Rector of Stretham, author of “Suffolk\r\nSuperstitions” and “The History of Hadleigh,” died in October.\r\n\r\nMR. WILLIAM PETTIT GRIFFITH, architect, died in October. The son of an\r\narchitect of repute, he was born in 1815, and, adopting his father’s\r\nprofession, followed it for more than half a century. Devoting much of\r\nhis leisure to archæology, he became a member of several societies of\r\nantiquaries, and wrote “Grecian Architecture,” “A Natural System of\r\nArchitecture,” “Mediæval Architecture,” “Ancient and Gothic Churches,”\r\nbesides many papers published in archæological journals and magazines,\r\nespecially the serial of the Surrey Archæological Society. He designed\r\nvarious schools and other minor public buildings, and restored St.\r\nJohn’s Gate, Clerkenwell, and parts of the church of St. Sepulchre,\r\nHolborn.\r\n\r\nMR. OCTAVIAN BLEWITT, K.L., F.R.G.S., many years secretary of the Royal\r\nLiterary Fund, died recently, aged 81. In early life Mr. Blewitt\r\ntravelled much in Italy, Egypt, Greece, Turkey, and other countries, and\r\non his return to England was, in 1839, elected to the post of secretary\r\nto the Royal Literary Fund. In this capacity Mr. Blewitt spent many\r\nyears in arranging the papers, literary, financial, and historical,\r\nwhich constituted the records of the association. Mr. Blewitt was the\r\nauthor of several well-known works, including “The Panorama of Torquay,”\r\npublished in 1828, and afterwards reprinted in an enlarged edition as “A\r\nDescriptive and Historical Sketch of the District comprised between the\r\nDart and Teign,” also the “Handbook for Central Italy and Rome,” and the\r\n“Handbook for Southern Italy and Naples,” being two of the series of\r\nMurray’s Hand-books.\r\n\r\nSIGNOR LUIGI BONFATTI, the archivist and librarian of Gubbio, in Umbria,\r\ndied suddenly at the end of October. “Every seeker into the strange and\r\neventful history of what is now but the time-worn relic of a mediæval\r\ncity,” writes Mr. W. Mercer, “has lost in him a guide, philosopher, and\r\nfriend. Only a week before his death he climbed with me the picturesque\r\ntower of the Palazzo Pubblico, that often served as a prison-house for\r\ncaptives taken in battle. His pen, fertile with a knowledge of the local\r\nantiquities, may be traced in numerous brochures and collected records\r\nof recent date. He strove to pierce the shadows that cluster round the\r\nmemory of Maestro Giorgio and others who made Gubbio famous for his\r\nporcelain manufacture, marvels truly of the potter’s art that are\r\nscattered far and wide. One small plate only is left to witness in the\r\nMunicipio to the brilliant _reverberi_ that distinguished the work of\r\nartists whose successors from time to time have vainly imagined that\r\nthey also have caught the secret of the changing colours under flashes\r\nof instantaneous light. I left him busily arranging rare books, with a\r\npromise that he would send me an early copy of a history of Gubbio, now\r\nnearly ready for the press in the able hands of a learned notary, Signor\r\nLucarelli. Those who have known Signor Bonfatti will join me in\r\nlamenting the loss of a scholar whose name may sound strange outside\r\nUmbria, and unfamiliar to most Italian ears, but which is, nevertheless,\r\nan enduring name, notwithstanding its closest connection is with a\r\nhalf-forgotten, ruinous city that itself lies out of the beaten track of\r\nwayfarers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeetings of Learned Societies.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETROPOLITAN.\r\n\r\nROYAL ARCHÆOLOGICAL INSTITUTE.--_Nov. 6_, Mr. J. Micklethwaite, F.S.A.,\r\nin the chair. The Rev. H. M. Scarth, Rector of Wrington, read a paper on\r\nthe “Recent Discoveries of Roman Remains at Bath,” in which he explained\r\nthe various additions to the ancient Thermæ which have lately been\r\nbrought into the open air, including the large central bath, with its\r\nambulatory, &c. The discovery of antiquities at Zoan, in Egypt, formed\r\nthe subject of a discourse by Mr. Flinders Petrie, who exhibited some of\r\nthe objects which had been found. Many of these were taken from the\r\nresidence of a man of consequence in Egypt, and included articles of\r\ndomestic use and personal ornamentation,--statues, combs. The last paper\r\nread was by Mr. E. Peacock, F.S.A., and comprised some interesting notes\r\non the curious custom of swan marking, or “swan-upping.”\r\n\r\nLONDON AND MIDDLESEX ARCHÆOLOGICAL SOCIETY.--A crowded conversazione was\r\nheld at Skinners’ Hall on Wednesday evening, Nov. 12; Mr. Alfred White,\r\nF.S.A., presided. Mr. G. Laurence Gomme read a paper on “The Early\r\nMunicipal History of London,” touching upon its charters and\r\ninstitutions, its corporations and public bodies. Mr. J. D. Mathews\r\nfollowed with some “Reminiscences of the Church and Parish of St. John\r\nthe Baptist upon Walbrook.” Mr. John E. Price then read a paper “On the\r\nRecent Discoveries made on the Line of the Inner Circle Railway and at\r\nBevis Marks.” He said the antiquarian treasures turned up in the course\r\nof tunnelling for the new railway were numerous and interesting. There\r\nwere, first of all, Roman sculpture and masonry in position, and the\r\nsame disjointed and used for other purposes by builders of more recent\r\nperiods. The fragments of Roman statuary were numerous, and for the most\r\npart well preserved along the route taken by the excavations; scrolls\r\nand inscriptions being also found. Roman art now and then came to light.\r\nThe remains of pottery discovered were slight, and not of exceptional\r\ninterest. At the close of his address the lecturer suggested that a fund\r\nshould be started and subscriptions invited, in order to purchase or\r\nprotect the numerous relics constantly being brought to light in London\r\nand elsewhere. Among the most interesting articles exhibited was Mr.\r\nWalford’s portrait of Dr. Johnson by Sir J. Reynolds, which was engraved\r\nin our July number for 1883; there was also a collection of plans, maps,\r\nand archæological fragments relating mainly to the city.\r\n\r\nSOCIETY OF BIBLICAL ARCHÆOLOGY.--_Nov. 4_, Dr. S. Birch, President, in\r\nthe chair. Mr. P. Le Page Renouf read a paper “On some Religious Texts\r\nof the Early Egyptian Period preserved in Hieratic Papyri of the\r\nBritish Museum.” The President described four fragments of papyrus\r\nbelonging to the Edinburgh Museum of Science and Art, and exhibited by\r\nthe Secretary of the Science and Art Department. Mr. E. A. Budge read\r\nsome notes on Egyptian stelæ, principally of the eighteenth dynasty.\r\n\r\nST. PAUL’S ECCLESIOLOGICAL SOCIETY.--_Oct. 28_, Mr. J. P. Seddon in the\r\nchair. Mr. Hugh Stannus read a paper on “The decoration of St. Paul’s\r\nCathedral,” in which he described the principles of treatment which he\r\nregarded as correct, including the “articulation” of the dome design\r\nwith the architectural substructure. A short discussion followed, in\r\nwhich Mr. Micklethwaite, Mr. G. H. Birch, and Mr. Statham took part. Mr.\r\nMicklethwaite urged the desirability of first settling the future\r\narrangement of the cathedral for worship, and its complete furniture (in\r\nthe widest sense) for that purpose, before deciding on the treatment of\r\nthe culminating point in the decoration. Mr. Statham recommended a\r\ntreatment of the dome in eight partitions, such a treatment being rather\r\nsuited to an octagon dome, such as that at Florence, and being, in fact,\r\na contradiction of the actual architectural structure of a hemispherical\r\ndome, and tending to weaken its effect of space and mystery, and reduce\r\nthe dome from poetry to prose. Mr. Seddon summed up in favour of this\r\nlatter view.\r\n\r\nNEW SHAKSPERE.--_Oct. 24_, Mr. F. J. Furnivall, Director, in the chair.\r\nThe Chairman congratulated the society on reaching its one hundredth\r\nmeeting. In speaking of work done during the past year, he called\r\nattention to Mr. S. L. Lee’s work on “As You Like It,” and that of the\r\nRev. W. A. Harrison on “Richard III.,” as examples of critical work; he\r\nalso spoke of the success of the Society’s performance of Shakespearian\r\nmusic in chronological order; and took the blame on himself for the\r\ndelay in the appearance of the “old spelling” edition, mentioning some\r\npoints in which the editors are endeavouring to make the edition as\r\ncomplete as possible. The following papers were read: by Miss Leigh-Noel\r\n“On Shakespeare’s Garden of Girls: I. Hothouse Flowers--Juliet, Imogen,\r\nOphelia,” and by Mr. E. Flügel, giving some early German criticisms on\r\nShakespeare by an ancestor of his own (1699), noticing Shakespeare as\r\nnot a learned man, not worth much attention, and greatly inferior to\r\nDryden.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR PRESERVING THE MEMORIALS OF THE DEAD.--_Oct. 28_\r\nand 30, twenty-four new members, including Lords Dartmouth and\r\nWharncliffe, and the Bishop of Chester, were elected. Reports as to the\r\nwork of the Society in the following cases were approved: The replacing\r\nof four brasses in Cheam Church; enclosure of the De Ros effigy, near\r\nYork; restoration of the Barnewall altar-tomb at Lusk, Ireland;\r\nreplacement of memorial slabs in Milford Church, and in the church of\r\nSt. Michael in Coslany, Norwich; headstone in Chetwynd churchyard.\r\nReports from the Executive Committee on the following cases were placed\r\nbefore the Council: The replacement of the “Pedlar’s Window” in Lambeth\r\nChurch; restoration of the monument of Sir Laurence Washington, in\r\nGarsdon Church; preservation of the De Vere effigies at Earl’s Colne;\r\nremoval of memorial slabs from Bishops Stortford Church; and of the\r\nBlackhall monument from Totnes Church; the replacement of memorial slabs\r\nin Bishops Cannings Church; publication of registers and inscriptions in\r\nBanstead Church. It was stated that the work of the Society could be\r\ngreatly enlarged if larger funds were forthcoming.\r\n\r\nHELLENIC.--_Oct. 23_, Professor C. T. Newton, C.B., in the chair. The\r\nRev. Edmond Warre, Head Master of Eton, read a paper on “The Raft of\r\nUlysses,” as described in the fifth book of the Odyssey. By personal\r\nresearch and observation of modern processes of shipbuilding, the writer\r\nhad arrived at a clear idea of the construction of the raft in question,\r\nand set forth his conclusions in detail, illustrating them by two models\r\nof a raft and of an ancient axe and adze, which had been made under his\r\ndirection in the School of Mechanics at Eton. Mr. Warre alluded to a\r\nconfirmation of his theory which he had lately seen in the construction\r\nof certain flat vessels which are used at Portsmouth for raising heavy\r\nweights from the water. Mr. Newton, after thanking Mr. Warre for his\r\npaper, reminded the audience that there existed in the British Museum\r\ntwo genuine fragments of ancient vessels--(1) a bronze figure-head from\r\nthe Bay of Actium, and (2) a cross-beam from the floor of an ancient\r\ngalley, dredged up from the bottom of the Lake of Nemi. Professor Jebb\r\nconsidered that Mr. Warre’s paper not only for the first time made quite\r\nclear the passage in the Odyssey, but also explained the poetical use of\r\nthe term σχἑδια for ships in general in a passage in the “Hecuba” of\r\nEuripides, because it snowed that such a raft seen from land would\r\nreally resemble a ship. Mr. E. A. Gardner read a paper on some armour\r\nand ornaments from Kertch, which were now in the new Museum at Oxford.\r\nAfter a description of the several articles, Mr. Gardner showed that the\r\nimportance of these finds in the Crimea lay in the fact that, if not of\r\nAthenian handiwork, they were certainly of Athenian design, and so might\r\nbe added to the comparatively scanty remnants of genuine Hellenic\r\nmetalwork. In connection with the representation of a camel upon one of\r\nthe ornaments, Mr. Newton pointed out that in a bronze found at Kameiros\r\nand now in the British Museum, a man with an Assyrian cut of beard was\r\nseated upon a kneeling camel. This bronze, though possibly of Phœnician\r\ndesign, was found in association with other objects belonging to archaic\r\nGreek art. Professor P. Gardner, alluding to the complete and sumptuous\r\nway in which the results of these Russian discoveries were published,\r\nsaid that in this respect despotic Russia set a good example to free\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nROYAL INSTITUTE OF BRITISH ARCHITECTS.--_Nov. 3_, Mr. Ewan Christian,\r\nPresident, in his opening address alluded to the immense strides which\r\narchitecture had made during the last fifty years under Barry, Pugin,\r\nScott, Street, Burgess, Ruskin, and others. He compared the great\r\nadvantages which students of the present day enjoyed with those which\r\nhad to be sought for and only acquired after long years of study, at the\r\ntime when the Institute was founded, and said that the good old charter\r\nunder which they were incorporated had been carried out to the letter,\r\nfor they had promoted, as far as possible, the general advancement of\r\narchitecture, and the various arts and sciences connected with it. Mr.\r\nG. Shaw-Lefevre, M.P., the First Commissioner of Works, in seconding a\r\nvote of thanks to the president, said it had been his duty to clear away\r\nthe old Law Courts, and to consider how the west front of Westminster\r\nHall could be best restored. He had taken the advice of Mr. Pearson, one\r\nof the most eminent architects in works of that kind, and he had\r\nsuggested that it should be restored to the condition in which it\r\nexisted during the reign of Richard II., the period when the Law Courts\r\nwere added to it. That would involve the building of a double-storied\r\ncloister against the wall of the Hall, so that all the beautiful Norman\r\nwork would be preserved, and, whilst not concealed, it would be kept\r\nfrom the effects of the atmosphere by which it was surrounded. As there\r\nwere different opinions, however, as to the expediency of this work, he\r\nhad decided to refer the question to a Select Committee of the House of\r\nCommons, when evidence could be heard for or against it. Another great\r\nimprovement would be found in the works at the Tower--a mass of old\r\nwarehouses had been removed, the inner ballium wall and the Lanthorn\r\nTower had been rebuilt, and this was a work which the public would\r\ngreatly appreciate when it was complete. No grander field in the world\r\nfor architectural display was to be found than in the Metropolis. An\r\nunbroken series of great buildings, showing every phase of architecture\r\nduring the last 800 years, was to be seen in it, specially in the Tower,\r\nin Westminster Abbey, and in the works of Inigo Jones, Wren, and Barry.\r\nHe believed, however, that they had arrived at the end of the Gothic\r\nrevival, so far as secular buildings were concerned, although it might\r\nflourish in other respects for many years. Public opinion and the\r\nemployment of experts were doing a great work in the selection of styles\r\nfor buildings of all kinds, and he hoped that the present race of\r\narchitects would be able to leave us buildings as beautiful as did those\r\nwho lived in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVINCIAL.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY.--_October 20_, Mr. J. W. Clark, M.A.,\r\nPresident, in the chair. Mr. A. G. Wright exhibited five denarii of\r\nPosthumus, with the legends FELICITAS · AVG: IOVI · STATORI · NEPTVNO ·\r\nREDVCI: SAECVLI · FELICITAS: SARAPI · COMITI · AVG · from the\r\nBeaconsthorpe hoard (1878): also a Roman bronze ear-ring and a mediæval\r\nbronze signet-ring, both found at Stony Hill, Lakenheath, early in this\r\npresent year; also a photograph of a rare palæolithic implement found at\r\nMarch, in 1877. The Rev. S. S. Lewis exhibited a first brass of Marcus\r\nAurelius,_rev._ HONOS with portrait of the Emperor erect, olive-branch\r\nand cornucopiæ (141 A.D.), found in 1883 at Litlington. The Rev. G. F.\r\nBrowne exhibited an outlined rubbing of the Wilne font, a very intricate\r\nand elaborate piece of early work, with twelve bold characters round the\r\nbase, supposed to be runic or Oriental, and, in the latter case,\r\nprobably Palmyrene. Mr. Browne showed next a rubbing of the cross at\r\nHawkswell, near Catterick, with the inscription on a small panel, _Hæc\r\nest crux sancti jacobi_: “This is the Cross of the holy James.” The\r\nletters have now almost entirely perished. Bede says that James the\r\nDeacon, who was with Paulinus when he Christianised Northumbria and\r\nbaptized so many thousands (A.D. 627), lived to a very advanced age near\r\nCatterick, and that the place where he lived was called by his name.\r\nGale, in his Itineraries, said this was Akeburg. The only place now\r\nknown by any such name is a single farmhouse called on the ordnance map\r\nAkebar, near Hawkswell Church. Mr. Browne found that _jacobi_ was spelt\r\n_gacobi_ on the cross, and therefore supposed that it was pronounced in\r\nAnglian times with a strong initial _y_, and with a short _o_, and asked\r\nthe people whether there was any place near beginning with Yak. He was\r\ntold that Akebar was pronounced locally Yakbur. This and the cross\r\ntogether made it practically certain that James the Deacon lived at\r\nAkebar, _i.e._, Jacob-burh, or Yakŏbur, and was buried at Hawkswell. The\r\nclose resemblance of the panel and the inscription to Welsh crosses made\r\nMr. Browne suspect a British influence, and he thought this gave the key\r\nto a great puzzle in the early Church history of Northumbria. Nennius\r\nsaid that Rum (or Rumin), son of Urien, baptized Edwin and the\r\nNorthumbrians, when it is known that Paulinus was the baptizer, and\r\nthere is nothing to show that Paulinus was Rum. James had an ally in\r\nRomanus, the chaplain of Queen Eanfleda, who was the first infant\r\nbaptized in Northumbria. This Romanus may account for the British\r\ncharacter of James’s monument, and may be the Rum or Rumin who has\r\npuzzled historians. The Jarrow inscription, _In hoc singulari anno vita\r\nredditur mundo_, had always been taken as a hopeless puzzle. Mr. Browne\r\nshowed that the stone on which it is cut had formed part of the wall of\r\nthe original building, in which also was a stone setting forth that the\r\nchurch was dedicated in the fifteenth year of King Ecfrid (A.D. 684) and\r\nthe fourth year of Abbat Ceolfrid. This would give a year to which the\r\ninscription might refer, if it could be shown that any very remarkable\r\nrestoration took place in that year. Mr. Browne showed from passages in\r\nBede that it was the year in which the Abbot of Monkwearmouth and many\r\nof his monks died of a pestilence which ravaged the district, and\r\nespecially Jarrow, which is not heard of after that year. Hence the\r\nreference was to the cessation of the plague in the year 684. Mr. O. C.\r\nPell, after stating the strong grounds for supposing that there were\r\nmany “libere tenentes” in existence at the time of Domesday Survey, and\r\nthat they appear in the “Inquisitio Eliensis” as _villani_ holding acres\r\nof demesne land, argued--from (among other examples) an entry in the\r\n“Inquisitio Eliensis” respecting Chatteris Manor--that the _carucæ_ of\r\nthe “lords” and the associated _carucæ_ of the “homines” were of one and\r\nthe same uniform standard for rating purposes and for measuring areas of\r\n_terræ ad carucam_, and showed thereby that this standard was the\r\ncapacity of a plough drawn by eight oxen. The necessary consequence\r\nappeared to be that there must have been at least 324 “homines” holding\r\nvirgates in villenage in the Isle of Ely alone. This theory was proved\r\nto be correct by a comparison of Domesday Survey with the surveys of\r\ncertain manors contained in old MSS. of 1221 and 1277.\r\n\r\nHAILEYBURY COLLEGE ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY.--_Sept. 29._ The Rev. H. C.\r\nWright gave an account of a holiday spent in Norway. After a few remarks\r\non the beauty of Norwegian cathedrals in general, and on the wooden\r\nchurch at Borgund, he proceeded to describe a Viking’s ship which he had\r\nseen. The mound in which the Viking was supposed to be buried was very\r\nmuch dilapidated. The ship was built entirely of oak, and apparently had\r\nneither deck nor seats, so that the rowers had to stand upright to row\r\nit. The word Viking, he added, is probably derived from the Vicks or\r\nFiords, and is in no way akin to the word sea-king. Mr. F. W. Headley\r\npointed out, with reference to the Viking’s ship, that the planks were\r\nfastened on to the ribs of the ship by withies. Speaking of Trondhjem\r\nCathedral, he mentioned the transepts as in good repair. The nave, now\r\nalmost gone, has contained some very fine Norman work, and the apse at\r\nthe end of it, which is divided from the choir by a light screen,\r\ncontains several styles of architecture, ranging from Early English to\r\nFlamboyant. Several photographs were passed round in illustration of the\r\nspeaker’s remarks. Mr. A. W. T. Perowne spoke of Knaresborough Castle,\r\nin one of the dungeons of which may be seen a pillar with twelve arches\r\nspringing from it. He also spoke of Fountains Abbey, which contains both\r\nEarly English and Norman work--the cloisters and refectory being\r\nspecimens of the latter. He also gave short accounts of Ripley, Bolton\r\nAbbey, Fountains Abbey, and St. Mary’s Abbey, at York. Mr. H. F. Fisher\r\ndescribed Wimborne Minster, a cruciform building having two towers--the\r\ncentral and the western. Between the central tower and the east end is\r\na Norman arch. Under the chancel is a crypt, and there is a church\r\nlibrary over the vestry. The church contains also a lunar orrery, of\r\nwhich there are only two other specimens in England--at Wells and at\r\nYork. Mr. H. Swainson next spoke of Bosham, near Chichester. The setting\r\nout of Harold from Bosham Harbour on a voyage to Normandy is recorded in\r\nthe Bayeux tapestry. The church is built on the site of an old Roman\r\nbasilica. In the vestry may be seen the corbels of the floor of the room\r\nonce occupied by the man who kept the light in the tower. The church has\r\na wooden spire. The chronicler spoke of St. Nicholas Church, Leicester,\r\nwhere are some Roman bricks in the tower, and of the Town-hall, which is\r\nof wood. He next spoke of Warwick Hospital, founded by the Earl of Essex\r\nfor twelve old men and a minister, each of whom has a strip of garden;\r\nthey all move up in turn whenever one dies, the minister always\r\nretaining the first strip. Passing on into Shropshire, he spoke of\r\nWenlock Priory, which contains two very large ambulatories; also of the\r\nTown-hall, where are a set of stocks, which are not fixed, but stand on\r\nwheels. In speaking of Lichfield Cathedral, he mentioned the three\r\nspires, and seven huge decorated windows in the Lady-chapel, and also\r\nthe watching gallery, a feature which exists also in St. Alban’s Abbey.\r\nThe Close at Lichfield was formerly defended by a moat, of which the\r\npresent Minster pool is a survival. He also censured the recent removal\r\nof the “Pedlar’s Window” from the parish church at Lambeth. Mr. E. P.\r\nAsh, a visitor, spoke of Eisenach and the Wartburg, which is said to\r\nderive its name from the following incident of Lewis the Springer, who\r\nin one of his hunting expeditions, happening to come on the hill on\r\nwhich the Wartburg now stands, exclaimed “_Wart Berg_ du sollst meine\r\n_Burg_sein” Having given some account of the connection of St. Elizabeth\r\nwith the Wartburg, from which she was ultimately expelled, and took\r\nrefuge in a convent, he proceeded to speak of Luther, who is said to\r\nhave spent ten months therein translating the Bible. Several relics of\r\nLuther and his family may be seen there still. In the chapel are some\r\nswords that are supposed to have belonged to Gustavus Adolphus.\r\n\r\nSURREY ARCHÆOLOGICAL SOCIETY.--At a special general meeting held Oct.\r\n15, Mr. Granville Leveson-Gower, F.S.A., in the chair, it was resolved\r\nthat the annual general meeting be hereafter held in January or\r\nFebruary, instead of in June or July as at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAntiquarian News & Notes.\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR SAYCE left England in November to spend the winter in Egypt.\r\n\r\nTHE mode of treatment of the west front of Westminster Hall is under the\r\nconsideration of Parliament.\r\n\r\nTHE musical library of Mr. Julian Marshall was lately sold by auction at\r\nthe rooms of Messrs. Sotheby, Wilkinson & Hodge.\r\n\r\nTHE four-light east window of Akely Church, near Buckingham, has been\r\nfilled with stained glass by Messrs. Meyer & Co., of Munich.\r\n\r\nIT is reported, on what we believe to be good authority, that Lord\r\nCarnarvon is about to resign the Presidency of the Society of\r\nAntiquaries.\r\n\r\nTHE Bishop of Peterborough having disapproved of the action of the\r\nCommittee for the restoration of the Cathedral, the work has been\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nA MEMORIAL painted window to Richard Hooker, the “judicious” divine of\r\nQueen Elizabeth’s reign, has just been unveiled in his old church,\r\nBishopsbourne, near Canterbury.\r\n\r\nTHE library belonging to Sir John H. Thorold, at Syston, very rich in\r\nancient and curious books, will be sold by Messrs. Sotheby & Wilkinson\r\non the 12th of December and following days.\r\n\r\nTHE intended collection of Turner’s works at the Winter Exhibition of\r\nthe Academy will not be made this season, owing to the dampness of the\r\nwalls of the new rooms at Burlington House.\r\n\r\nTHE ancient civic maces belonging to the borough of Tenby have been\r\nlately repaired and restored by Mr. G Lambert, F.S.A., and at his cost.\r\nThis is one result of the recent Archæological Congress in South Wales.\r\n\r\nMr. W. BLACK’S last novel, “Judith Shakespeare,” is worthy of notice for\r\nthe vast amount of antiquarian interest with which the author has\r\ncontrived to invest not only Stratford-on-Avon, and Shakespeare’s house,\r\nbut the interior of his home.\r\n\r\n“NOSSETT’S MYTHOLOGY,” Greek and Roman, has been now translated into\r\nEnglish by Mrs. Angus W. Hall. The book, which is illustrated with\r\ndrawings by the translator, will be published by Messrs. Kirby & Endean.\r\n\r\nTHE Hardwicke historical manuscripts, which chiefly consist of\r\ncorrespondence with foreign Courts during the reigns of George I. and\r\nII., were lately sold to Mr. Astor, who has presented them to the Astor\r\npublic library in New York.\r\n\r\nMR. R. GARNETT, the kind and courteous Superintendent of the Reading\r\nRoom of the British Museum, has given up his position, having accepted\r\nthe post of Assistant Keeper. Mr. Fortescue, who is well known to\r\n_habitués_ of the Museum, succeeds Mr. Garnett.\r\n\r\nTHE _East Anglian_ is about to be revived under the title of _The\r\nSuffolk Antiquary and East Anglian Archæological Notes and Queries_. It\r\nwill be edited by the Rev. C. H. E. White, of Ipswich, Hon. Secretary of\r\nthe Suffolk Archæological Institute. We wish the newly revived venture\r\nall possible success.\r\n\r\nTHE Hon. Lewis Wingfield has been engaged in mounting four new\r\nproductions--“Cymbeline,” which will be played at the Lyceum in March\r\nnext, for Miss Anderson; “The School for Scandal,” for Mrs. Langtry, to\r\nbe produced at the Prince’s Theatre; “As You Like It,” for the St.\r\nJames’s; and an important revival of “The Comedy of Errors,” for the\r\nAmerican Dromios, Messrs. Robson & Crane.\r\n\r\nMR. THACKERAY TURNER, as Secretary of the Society for the Protection of\r\nAncient Buildings, writes to the _Times_ from 9, Buckingham-street,\r\nStrand, very strongly remonstrating against a proposal which has been\r\nmade, and which has been sanctioned by the architect, Mr. Pearson,\r\ngradually to re-face the exterior stonework of Westminster Abbey. He\r\nsays that by so doing we shall only be forestalling the action of time.\r\n\r\nMR. MURRAY’S list of forthcoming works includes the following:\r\n“Bolingbroke, an historical study,” by J. Churton Collins. “London; its\r\nhistory, antiquarian and modern,” by James Thorne, F.S.A., and H. B.\r\nWheatley, F.S.A. “Works of Alexander Pope,” with notes, &c., by W. J.\r\nCourthope. “History of the Roman Empire, from the establishment of the\r\nEmpire to the accession of Commodus, A.D. 180.”\r\n\r\nCATALOGUES of rare and curious books, most of which contain the names of\r\nworks of antiquarian interest, have reached us from Messrs. Jarvis and\r\nSon, 28, King William-street, W.C. (comprising a copy of “Othello,”\r\n4to. edition, 1655); Messrs. Fawn and Son, Queen’s-road, Bristol; Mr.\r\nGeo. Redway, York-street, Covent-garden; Mr. Henry Gray, Cathedral-yard,\r\nManchester; Messrs. Robson and Kerslake, 23, Coventry-street, Haymarket,\r\nW.; Von Kühl, Jägerstrasse, Berlin; Von Albert Cohn, Mohrenstrasse,\r\nBerlin.\r\n\r\nTHE descriptive and historical account of the Cathedral Churches of\r\nEngland and Wales, which has been for some time past in preparation,\r\nwill be published forthwith by Messrs. Cassell & Co. The contributors\r\nwill include Canon Tristram, Dean Kitchin, Rev. Dr. Jessopp, Canon\r\nVenables, Prebendary Havergal, Prebendary Gregory Smith, Rev. R. St.\r\nJohn Tyrwhitt, Canon Swainson, Dean Howson, Archdeacon Norris, Canon\r\nCreighton, Professor T. M‘Kenny Hughes, Rev. Professor Coolidge, and the\r\nBishop of Sodor and Man. The work will contain an introduction by the\r\nRev. Professor Bonney.\r\n\r\nMR. FREDERICK HAWKINS’S “Annals of the French Stage from its Origin to\r\nthe Death of Racine,” have been published by Messrs. Chapman & Hall. Mr.\r\nHawkins, says the _Times_, is the first English writer who has\r\nundertaken to deal with this subject on a scale larger than that of a\r\nmagazine article. It is understood that he has endeavoured to give his\r\nwork some value as one of literary history and criticism, and has\r\ndevoted much care to an elucidation of the relations between the Church\r\nand the stage in olden times. For his information as to the material\r\nsituation of the Comédie Française he is indebted to the unpublished\r\nregisters of that theatre.\r\n\r\nTHE following articles, more or less of an antiquarian character, appear\r\namong the contents of the magazines for November:--_Quarterly Review_,\r\n“France under Richelieu.” _Art Journal_, “Collection of Casts at South\r\nKensington;” “The Western Riviera, La Mortola, and Ventimiglia;” “Marble\r\nand Marble Mosaic.” _English Illustrated Magazine_, “Play, a Scene from\r\nthe Life of the Last Century;” “Eton.” _Edinburgh Review_, “The Irish\r\nMassacres of 1641;” “Boulger’s History of China.” _Temple Bar_,\r\n“Recollections of Canning and Brougham;” “A Visit to Rothenburg.”\r\n_Century Magazine_, “The Old Sedan Chair;” “Sculptors of the Early\r\nItalian Renaissance.” _Contemporary Review_, “Wurzburg and Vienna;”\r\n“Goethe;” “Greek Cities under Roman Rule.” _Monthly Packet_, “Cameos\r\nfrom English History.” _Journal of Education_, “The Teaching of\r\nHistory.”\r\n\r\nTHE civic procession to the Royal Courts of Justice on “Lord Mayor’s\r\nDay” (November 10) contained several picturesque and interesting\r\npageants, representing different historic incidents and personages\r\nconnected with the early history of the City of London. These included\r\nWilliam the Conqueror, Richard Cœur de Lion, Henricus Fitz-Alwyne,\r\nthe first Mayor of London, Richard II., and Queen Elizabeth. The\r\nimmortal “Dick” Whittington was represented sitting by the Highgate\r\nmile-post, accompanied by his cat, and in the act of listening to the\r\nbells of Bow Church, a model of which, as it was in A.D. 1400, came next\r\nin the procession; and this was followed by a counterfeit presentment of\r\nSir Richard Whittington in all his civic dignity. The representative of\r\nLord Mayor Walworth, standing over the slain Wat Tyler, was received\r\nwith groans and hisses as the procession passed along.\r\n\r\nTHE _Progrès de l’Aisne_ gives the following particulars with regard to\r\nsome discoveries which have lately been made by M. Moreau, a wellknown\r\nantiquarian, at Chouy, near St. Quentin. The village, though situated\r\nupon a height, is well provided with water, and M. Moreau has\r\ndiscovered traces of ancient Roman baths, though the small number of\r\narms found induces the belief that it was never a military post during\r\nthe Roman occupation. The cemetery was used as a place of interment from\r\na period preceding the conquest of Gaul by Cæsar until the eighth\r\ncentury without interruption, and a large number of Gallic and\r\nGallo-Roman graves have been discovered. Among other articles found were\r\na Gallic boot sole, studded with nails, 27 buckles, clasps and plates in\r\nbronze and iron, 38 bracelets, rings, and other articles of personal\r\nadornment, mostly in bronze, though a few are silver-gilt, six bronze\r\npieces of money of the time of Licinius, Crisus, Constantine II.,\r\nValens, and Valentianus I., two bronze dishes, 89 earthen dishes and 14\r\nin glass, nine iron swords, 15 hatchets, daggers, and javelins, 108\r\nflints of all shapes, thousands of coffin nails, and a signet ring with\r\nnine facets, upon which are engraved the greeting _vivas_, the dove and\r\nolive branch, the palm, the lamb, the stag, and the hare, symbols in use\r\namong the early Christians.\r\n\r\nAMONG the various properties advertised for sale is Etall Castle, one of\r\nthe Northumbrian “Peel Castles,” as they are styled. It is situated in\r\nthe parish of Ford, about six miles from Coldstream, in the valley of\r\nthe Till, a tributary of the Tweed. The present mansion is modern, of\r\nstone, with a heavy roof, and large square windows. It is approached by\r\nan avenue of finely-grown trees, the gardens are laid out in the Italian\r\nstyle, and the entire estate comprises about 3,440 acres. Near the\r\nmansion is the parish church, built by Butterfield in 1850, in memory of\r\nthe late Lord Frederick Fitzclarence and his only daughter. On the west\r\nof the village, on the banks of the river, and about a quarter of a mile\r\nfrom the mansion, are the picturesque ruins of the ancient castle, once\r\nthe abode of the noble family of Manners. This castle was taken by the\r\narmy of James IV. of Scotland on his invasion of England in the year\r\n1513, shortly before the battle of Flodden Field, and is mentioned by\r\nSir Walter Scott in the Fifth canto of “Marmion,” as well as the other\r\nborder fortresses in the neighbourhood--Wark, Ford, and Norham. Over the\r\nentrance of the castle are sculptured the arms of Manners, it having\r\nbeen embattled by Sir Robert de Manners, who was knighted on the field\r\nof battle by Edward III. In the grounds is a handsome chapel, built of\r\nstone in the style of the Edwardian period; and near the river are to be\r\nseen the foundations of St. Mary’s Chapel and Well.--_Times._\r\n\r\nTHE dispersion of collections of art work is being apparently followed\r\nup by the sale of properties remarkable for historic or antiquarian\r\nfeatures. The sales of the Island of Herm and of Boscastle, in Cornwall\r\n(both of which were abortive), have been, or are to be, succeeded by two\r\nothers of a still more remarkable character. The one is the extensive\r\nruins of Middleham Castle, in Yorkshire, celebrated for its splendid\r\nNorman keep, built by Robert Fitz Ranulph, and famous as the stronghold\r\nof Warwick, the king-maker, and as the favourite residence of his\r\nson-in-law, Richard III. The fine appearance of the keep has, however,\r\nbeen considerably interfered with by the Decorated buildings which\r\nsurround it, and which were erected in the fifteenth century by Robert\r\nNeville, “the peacock of the North.” In later times, many of the scenes\r\nin “The Last of the Barons” were laid at Middleham. The second sale is\r\nthat of Goodrich Court and Castle, which, for picturesque effect, is one\r\nof the most beautiful and attractive localities in the scenery of the\r\nWye. Goodrich Court was, in Sir Samuel Meyrick’s time, noted for its\r\nunrivalled collection of mediæval armoury. The mansion itself is a\r\nrestoration by the late Mr. Blore. The castle, of which the principal\r\nremaining features are the gateway, a three-storied Norman keep, and an\r\nEdwardian banquetting-hall, was successively the residences of the Earls\r\nof Pembroke and the Talbots, and, later on, stood a gallant siege under\r\nSir Henry Lingen, who held it for the King against the Parliamentary\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nDURING the visit of a party of local archæologists to Wirksworth, in\r\nDerbyshire, a paper was read by Dr. Webb, proving that lead mining had\r\nbeen carried on there from time immemorial. The following circumstances\r\nsuggest that the Wirksworth mines were known to the Saxons: 1. A mine\r\nnear to Castleton was called Odin, after one of their gods. 2. Eadburga,\r\nAbbess of Repton (to which monastic institution the lead mines at\r\nWirksworth appear to have belonged at this time), sent from Wirksworth,\r\nA.D. 714, a leaden coffin, in which to bury St. Guthlac, Prior of\r\nCrowland Abbey, and formerly a monk at Repton. 3. Kenewara, also Abbess\r\nof Repton, gave the estate at Wirksworth, A.D. 835, to Humbert, the\r\nAlderman, on the condition that he gave lead to the value of three\r\nhundred shillings to Archbishop Colenoth, for the use of Christ’s\r\nChurch, Canterbury. That the mines were worked after the Norman Conquest\r\nis proved by a survey, in the possession of the Duchy of Lancaster, of\r\nPeveril Castle, made in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, who greatly\r\nencouraged mining operations by inviting skilled workmen from abroad;\r\nand this survey describes the castle as being covered with lead. As it\r\nwas built in the reign of the Conqueror, the lead used in its\r\nconstruction was probably obtained from Derbyshire mines; in fact,\r\nDomesday Book mentions the working of three lead mines at Wirksworth,\r\none at Crich, one at Ashford, one at Bakewell, and one at Metesford, a\r\nmanor in the neighbourhood of Matlock.--_Weekly Register._\r\n\r\nAMONG the most interesting properties which of late have come into the\r\nmarket is that of Boxley Abbey, near Maidstone, which was sold by\r\nauction in October last by Messrs. Walton & Lee, of Mount-street,\r\nGrosvenor-square. It is described as situated about two miles from\r\nMaidstone, and as consisting of about 900 acres of first-class meadow,\r\nhop and fruit plantations, arable and woodlands. It comprises the\r\nremains of the old Cistercian Abbey of Boxley, with its more modern\r\nElizabethan residence, gardener’s cottage, stabling and offices,\r\ngardens, lawns, fish-stews, and terraced walks, surrounded by the\r\nabbey-gate or home farm lands, partly enclosed within the abbey walls.\r\nThe estate, we are told, “lies within a ring fence, is well watered by\r\nan abundance of springs, is intersected by good roads, and abounds in\r\nhistorical traditions.” The Pilgrim’s-road, trodden by the feet of so\r\nmany persons on their way to and from the shrine of St. Thomas at\r\nCanterbury, and the walls of the Abbey, which is said to have been the\r\nfirst abode of Cistercian monks in England, dating from the beginning of\r\nthe eleventh century, a splendid specimen of an old tithe barn in\r\nexcellent preservation, and a monastic chapel, now converted into a\r\ndwelling-house, are objects of especial interest to the antiquary and\r\narchæologist. The abbey itself was founded about the middle of the\r\ntwelfth century by William d’Ipres, Earl of Kent. In the reign of Edward\r\nI. the Abbot was summoned to Parliament on several occasions; and Edward\r\nII. took up his residence at this abbey during the siege of Leeds Castle\r\nin October, 1221, from the refusal of its governor to provide lodgings\r\nfor Queen Isabella and her suite when going on pilgrimage to Canterbury.\r\nIt is said there was here a curious crucifix upon the rood-screen, which\r\ncame to be called the “Rood of Grace,” and of which the mechanism would\r\nseem to have been extremely ingenious. To this rood or crucifix the\r\nabbey was indebted for many offerings, its curious movements being\r\nreported as miraculous, and, under that impression, great numbers of\r\npeople were continually resorting thither. At the time of the\r\nReformation, the rood was publicly exposed at St. Paul’s-cross, in\r\nLondon, by the Bishop of Rochester, and soon afterwards broken to pieces\r\nand burnt.--_Times._\r\n\r\nTHE Marquis of Bute has given £500 to the fund for establishing a\r\nBritish School of Archæology at Athens. The executive committee\r\ncontemplate building a suitable house on Mount Lycabettus, in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of Athens, where a site has been placed at their\r\ndisposal by the Greek Government. It is intended that the house should\r\nafford a residence for the director, and should contain a library of\r\nreference. The aim of the school will be to promote the study of Greek\r\nart and architecture in their remains of every period; the study of\r\ninscriptions; the exploration of ancient sites; and especially all\r\nbranches of research which can illustrate Hellenic life and literature,\r\nfrom the earliest age. Membership of the school will be open to all\r\nstudents accredited by any university or college of Great Britain, by\r\nthe authorities of the British Museum, or of the Royal Academy, or by\r\nany other institution qualified to give credentials. The director will\r\nguide the studies of the members, and exercise a general supervision\r\nover the researches undertaken by them; report on the work of the\r\nschool, and on any discoveries which may come to his knowledge; and also\r\nafford information and advice to properly accredited British travellers\r\nin Greece. It is believed that, through the agency of the school,\r\nvaluable notes might be collected from visitors to the Hellenic\r\ncountries, who, without being specialists, are competent scholars and\r\nobservers; and such notes might conveniently be registered in the annual\r\nreport of the school. The increasing interest in archæological studies\r\nwhich is being manifested in the universities and schools of the country\r\nwarrants the hope that, when the school has been established at Athens,\r\nfacilities will be afforded to students desirous of proceeding thither\r\nfor the purpose of supplementing the knowledge derived from books by a\r\ndirect acquaintance with the scenes and monuments of Greek life. A\r\ngeneral feeling exists that England ought not to remain behind France,\r\nGermany, and the United States in possessing a centre in Greece for the\r\nfurtherance of intellectual studies. The general committee, of which the\r\nPrince of Wales is president, already includes representatives of the\r\nUniversities and public schools, of the Royal Academy, of the British\r\nMuseum, of the Society of Antiquaries, of the Society of Dilettanti, and\r\nof the London Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies. While it is\r\nbelieved that the funds already subscribed will probably be adequate for\r\nthe provision of a house and library, further contributions are still\r\nneeded for the purpose of endowing the office of director with a proper\r\nsalary, and of creating a printing fund for the publications of the\r\nschool. Any subscriptions towards these objects will be gratefully\r\nreceived and acknowledged by the treasurer, Mr. Walter Leaf, Old Change,\r\nE.C.; by the bankers, Messrs. Grindlay & Co., 55, Parliament-street,\r\nS.W.; or by the secretaries, Mr. T. H. S. Escott, 38, Brompton-crescent,\r\nS.W.; Mr. James Gow, 13, Old-square, Lincoln’s-inn; and Professor Jebb,\r\nthe University, Glasgow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAntiquarian Correspondence.\r\n\r\n                  Sin scire labores,\r\n    Quære, age: quærenti pagina nostra patet.\r\n\r\n     _All communications must be accompanied by the name and address of\r\n     the sender, not necessarily for publication._\r\n\r\n\r\n“SWORD-SLIPPER.”\r\n\r\nSIR,--In the registers of St. Nicholas’ Church (now the Cathedral) at\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne, in 1576, I find mention made of “William Browne,\r\nSword-Slipper;” as also of “Robert Peacock, Sword-Slipper;” and again in\r\nMarch, 1586, of “Robert Heslop, Sword-Slipper.” Brand, in his “History\r\nof Newcastle,” places the “sword-slippers” among the ancient but extinct\r\nCompanies of that town. As I can find no other record of such a\r\nfraternity, may I venture to ask whether any of your readers can throw\r\nlight upon its object and history.\r\n\r\nMUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMERSET FOLK LORE.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I cut the following paragraph the other day out of a local\r\nCalendar for 1882:--\r\n\r\n“On the eve of Twelfth Day, in Somersetshire, at evening, the farmers,\r\ntheir friends, servants, &c., all assemble, and near six o’clock all\r\nwalk together to a field where wheat is growing. Twelve small fires and\r\none large one are lighted. The attendants, headed by the master of the\r\nfamily, pledge the company in old cider. A circle is formed round the\r\nlarge fire, when a general shout and hallooing takes place, which you\r\nhear answered from all the villages and fields near. This being\r\nfinished, the company all return to the house, where the good wife and\r\nher maids are preparing supper. A large cake is always provided, with a\r\nhole in the middle. After supper the company all attend the head\r\nherdsman to the wainhouse. The man, at the head of his friends, fills a\r\ncup with ale, and stands opposite the first or finest oxen; he then\r\npledges him in a curious toast, and the company follow his example with\r\nall the other oxen, addressing each by his name. This being over, the\r\nlarge cake is produced with much ceremony, and put on the horn of the\r\nfirst ox, through the hole in the cake; he is then tickled, to make him\r\ntoss his head. If he throws the cake behind, it is the mistress’s\r\nperquisite; if before, the herdsman claims it. They then all return to\r\nthe house, and spend the rest of the day in festivity.”\r\n\r\nMay I ask whether this custom is really still kept up, or whether it is\r\namong the old customs that have passed away?\r\n\r\nCURIOSUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND OF THE SCOTS.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The following jottings may be of interest to your correspondent,\r\n“R. M. B.” The incident on which Professor Aytoun founded his wellknown\r\nLay is narrated in a tract, the full title of which is as follows:\r\nMemoirs | of the | Lord Viscount Dundee, | the | Highland Clans, | and |\r\nThe Massacre of Glenco: | with | an Account | of | Dundee’s Officers\r\nafter they went to | France. | By an Officer of the Army. | Non ille pro\r\ncaris amicis | Aut Patria timidus mori (_sic_). Hor. Carm. Lib. 4, Ode 9\r\n|.\r\n\r\nQuis Cladem illius Noctis, quis funera fando | Explicet.--Virg. Æneid.\r\nLib. 2. |\r\n\r\n| Series longissima Rerum | Per tot ducta Viros.--Ibid. Lib. I. |\r\n\r\nLondon: Printed for Jonas Brown, at the Black Swan, 1714.\r\n\r\nThe tract itself is somewhat rare, but a reprint will be found in vol.\r\niii. of the “Miscellanea Scotica:” Glasgow, 1818. Sufficiently copious\r\nextracts from it have been given by Professor Aytoun in the introductory\r\nremarks to his Lay. Here is Lord Macaulay’s opinion on the matter. In a\r\nnote to the 13th chapter of his History he observes: “I have seldom made\r\nuse of the ‘Memoirs of Dundee,’ printed in 1714, and never without some\r\nmisgiving. The writer was certainly not, as he pretends, one of Dundee’s\r\nofficers, but a stupid and ignorant Grub-street garreteer. He is utterly\r\nwrong both as to the place and as to the time of the most important of\r\nall the events which he relates, the battle of Killiecrankie. He says\r\nthat it was fought on the banks of the Tummell, and on the 13th of June.\r\nIt was fought on the banks of the Garry, and on the 27th of July. After\r\ngiving such a specimen of inaccuracy as this, it would be idle to point\r\nout minor blunders.”\r\n\r\nIt is by no means unlikely, therefore, that the Island of the Scots is\r\nsituated in one of the rivers of Utopia.\r\n\r\nW. WILSON.\r\n\r\n_Berwick-on-Tweed, September 5._\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTREEVE.\r\n\r\nSIR,--“You may put up the shutters, Thomas, it’s all over now!”\r\nexclaimed the famous bootmaker to his shop-boy, on being solemnly\r\ninformed by a youthful customer, in words of awful admonition, that he\r\nwas under the painful necessity of withdrawing his custom. With similar\r\nsolemnity Dr. Pring has informed us that “the character of Mr. Round’s\r\npapers is otherwise such as would deter me from giving any further time\r\nto their discussion,” and “must for the future preclude my bestowing any\r\nfurther notice on anything emanating from Mr. Round” (_ante_, p. 254-5).\r\nFortunately, this awful blow has not proved so crushing as might have\r\nbeen feared. Indeed, though it is not for me to suggest that Dr. Pring\r\nmay possibly be well advised in shrinking from further criticism of my\r\npapers, I may express my regret that he should have found no better plea\r\nfor his withdrawal than that of “misrepresentation”--a serious charge,\r\nwhich I emphatically deny. It will be seen, on referring to Dr. Pring’s\r\noriginal paper (_ante_, iv. 264), that his argument runs thus:--\r\n\r\n     “That the distinction thus insisted upon is correct, and at once\r\n     settles the true significance of the word _port_ in Port-reeve, is\r\n     placed beyond all question by passages still extant in the laws of\r\n     Athelstan, which ordain that no man shall buy any property outside\r\n     _the port or gate_” (the italics are his own), &c. &c.\r\n\r\nIt would indeed place the identity of _port_ and _gate_ “beyond all\r\nquestion” if such an expression as “the port or gate” occurred “in the\r\nlaws of Athelstan.” _But it does not._ The expression is simply “that no\r\nman buy any property _out of port_” (Stubbs’ “Select Charters,” p. 65).\r\nHere it will be seen there is _nothing whatever_ to prove the identity\r\nof “port” and “gate.” The words “or gate” are a deliberate addition, and\r\nas it is on them alone that Dr. Pring’s argument, as will be seen, is\r\nbased, without them it falls to the ground. No reference to the views of\r\nCamden, Sharon Turner, or any other writer can justify the insertion\r\ninto “the laws of Athelstan” of words _which are not in them_. In saying\r\nthis much, I am guilty of no “misrepresentation.” I am simply stating\r\nfacts and exposing misquotation.\r\n\r\nMay I, in addition, express my hope that Dr. Pring will devote the time\r\nsaved from discussing my papers to the task, as I suggested, of\r\nconverting Mr. Hall to his own _porta_ derivation? And may I also\r\nassure him that the time which his solemn decision will save me shall be\r\ndevoted on my part to the further prosecution of those researches which,\r\nhowever undeservedly, have attracted, strange as it may appear to him,\r\nthe welcome appreciation of scholars?\r\n\r\nJ. H. ROUND.\r\n\r\n_Brighton._\r\n\r\n\r\nWITCHCRAFT IN ROSS-SHIRE.\r\n\r\nSIR,--No doubt most of your readers are familiar with the curious\r\ndetails concerning witch doctors and their doings in Mauritius, which\r\nwere published in _The Times_ in August last. The following interesting\r\naccount of similar superstitions in the Highlands, by a correspondent of\r\nthe _Glasgow Herald_, caused considerable sensation on its appearance,\r\nwhich would be about a week or two before the article in the former\r\npaper. Unquestionably, the belief in witchcraft is still deplorably\r\nwidespread, the boasted “resources of civilisation” notwithstanding:--\r\n\r\n     “The belief in witchcraft, which has never become quite extinct in\r\n     the more remote parts of the Highlands, has recently been revived\r\n     in a certain parish on the west coast of Ross-shire. Considering\r\n     the strong disposition that exists in the Highlands to set down to\r\n     supernatural agency every trifling little incident that cannot be\r\n     otherwise readily accounted for, it is not surprising that cases of\r\n     supposed witchcraft should crop up from time to time. These cases\r\n     have generally only a local interest, form the subject of\r\n     conversation for a few days, and are then quite forgotten. Apart\r\n     from the serious loss sustained by the parties concerned, the\r\n     circumstances attending the present revival of the belief in occult\r\n     powers of darkness are of such a nature as to have confirmed not a\r\n     few in the belief in witchcraft who formerly were sceptical on the\r\n     subject. Some time ago a party of gipsies, who had been encamped in\r\n     the locality in question, took the liberty of grazing their horses\r\n     on pasture belonging to a township of small tenants in the\r\n     immediate neighbourhood of their camp. This unwarranted\r\n     encroachment on their rights the tenants resented, and drove away\r\n     the obnoxious intruders, bag and baggage, from the place. On taking\r\n     their departure, some of the gipsies were heard to remark that the\r\n     tenants might not be quite so conservative of their pasture, which,\r\n     ere long, they would have no cattle to consume. At the time no\r\n     notice was taken of this implied threat. Soon after, however, three\r\n     valuable cows belonging to one of the tenants died one after the\r\n     other in quick succession, suddenly, and under mysterious\r\n     circumstances, while two of the other tenants lost a cow each under\r\n     similar circumstances. The illness of which these animals died was\r\n     of very short duration, and was unknown to the nosology of the\r\n     local veterinarians, who were completely baffled, and such of the\r\n     carcases as were examined presented no morbid appearance whatever,\r\n     the various organs and tissues being, apparently, in a healthy\r\n     condition. A respectable farmer, noted in the district for\r\n     uprightness and integrity of character, and who is considered an\r\n     authority in veterinary matters, had been called to see one of the\r\n     animals shortly before it died, and, having carefully examined the\r\n     beast, at once pronounced it to have been “witched,” as the\r\n     symptoms were those of no known disease. On the strength of this\r\n     statement on the part of one who is looked on as an authority in\r\n     such matters, coupled with the ominous language made use of by the\r\n     gipsies, a considerable section of the community unhesitatingly\r\n     attribute the death of the cattle to the agency of witchcraft. As a\r\n     charm against the evil influences at work, one of the tenants,\r\n     acting on the advice of the initiated, had the door of his byre\r\n     changed from one side of the house to the other, but with what\r\n     result remains to be seen. Pending the efficacy of this charm, a\r\n     young man has proceeded to the Western Isles, with the view of\r\n     consulting a famous witch doctor, said to be in practice there. As\r\n     an indication of the prevalence of the belief in witchcraft it may\r\n     be stated that in the district in question there are two witch\r\n     doctors residing within a distance of twenty miles of each other.\r\n     One of these, who has been discredited for some time, on account of\r\n     professional bungling, is generally regarded as an impostor, and\r\n     has suffered in his practice accordingly. The other, who evidently\r\n     has played his cards better, still retains the unbounded confidence\r\n     of the credulous in these matters, and his services are much sought\r\n     after in cases of suspected witchcraft. Sometimes the services of\r\n     the witch doctor are anticipated by timorous people, who propitiate\r\n     reputed witches by means of presents. While many believe that\r\n     witchcraft is still as prevalent as ever, there are others who\r\n     believe that, though it did undoubtedly exist at one time, there is\r\n     no such thing now, and that witches are extinct. Others there are\r\n     who believe that, though not nearly so prevalent as formerly, a\r\n     veritable witch is still occasionally to be met with in the flesh.\r\n     Probably this diversity of opinion on the subject may be taken as\r\n     an indication that even in the Highlands belief in witchcraft is in\r\n     process of dying out, though slowly.”\r\n\r\nP. J. MULLIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DE VERE MONUMENTS AT EARLS COLNE.\r\n\r\nThe following correspondence occurs in the _Standard_, Oct. 3:--\r\n\r\n     I.--SIR,--In the interests of archæology, and as a protest against\r\n     the alienation of our Historic Monuments, I ask to be allowed to\r\n     place before the public a statement in the hope that publicity may\r\n     prove the means of causing to be restored to their proper\r\n     resting-place in the Parish Church of Earls Colne, Essex, four\r\n     effigies of that once all-powerful family--the De Veres, Earls of\r\n     Oxford. I add a description of the monuments, taken from Murray’s\r\n     Handbook of the Eastern Counties: “Three of the effigies are carved\r\n     in alabaster and one in stone. They are supposed to commemorate\r\n     Robert, the fifth Earl, who died in 1295; Thomas, the eighth earl,\r\n     died 1371; Robert, the ninth earl, Marquess of Dublin and Duke of\r\n     Ireland, died 1392; and his second wife, Lancerona Serjeaulx the\r\n     joiner’s daughter (she wears the piked horn, or high head-dress,\r\n     introduced by Anne of Bohemia, Queen of Richard the Second, to whom\r\n     she had been Maid of Honour). This great Duke died at Louvain, and\r\n     Richard the Second, by whom he had been banished, caused his body\r\n     to be brought over, insisted that the coffin should be opened, so\r\n     that he might once more see his favourite, and attended it himself\r\n     in high procession to Earls Colne. John, the fourteenth earl, died\r\n     1426. At the dissolution of the Priory these effigies were removed\r\n     to the Parish Church, where they remained undisturbed until a few\r\n     years back, when for some reason (for which good cause should be\r\n     shown) they were transferred to, and now help to decorate, the\r\n     grounds of an adjacent landowner. Meetings of the Essex\r\n     Archæological Society have been held in this parish. It would be\r\n     interesting to learn whether any member was bold enough to enter a\r\n     protest against this spoliation; it would be doubly so to know\r\n     whether this transfer was done by power of a Faculty, the only\r\n     legal mode of transfer.”\r\n\r\nR. H. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--SIR,--With reference to a letter in the _Standard_ of October 3,\r\nsigned by R. H. H., I venture to think that the writer is not altogether\r\ncorrect in his facts, or, consequently, in his conclusions, concerning\r\nthe effigies of the De Veres.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago I made measured drawings of these valuable memorials,\r\nand they were then adequately protected and properly cared for by the\r\nlate Mr. Carwardine at Earls Colne Priory, a modern house occupying the\r\nsite, or, at least, taking the place, of the ancient Priory. I believe I\r\nam right in saying that the Parish Church was not, and never has been,\r\nthe resting-place of the De Vere Monuments, but that they originally\r\nstood in the Priory Church, where the De Veres were buried, and that\r\nthey remained there after the Dissolution, and until they were removed\r\nfor protection from the weather to the spot they now occupy by a former\r\nowner of the modern Priory. Had it not been for such timely care the\r\nMonuments would probably not have been in existence at all at the\r\npresent day, for it is well known that, early in this century, the\r\nChurch was not careful to extend any special protection to objects of\r\nthis kind within or without its walls; they took their chance--usually a\r\nvery rough one.\r\n\r\nIt is notorious, and a melancholy fact, that in our own day the\r\nrecklessness and ignorance of church “restoration”--with its illegal,\r\nnot to say wicked, destruction of monuments of all kinds--have not\r\nbrought about much feeling of security with regard to those that remain\r\nwithin the walls of churches; and while it has been a question of\r\nprotection rather than of “spoliation” at Earls Colne Priory, I for one\r\nam Philistine enough to be grateful to the Carwardine family for the\r\nrespect they paid to the De Vere Monuments in their hour of need, and\r\nwhen we may assume the Church held out no helping hand.\r\n\r\nIt is no peculiar thing that monumental effigies should be in private\r\nhands--witness the examples in Furness Abbey, in the ruins of numerous\r\nYorkshire abbeys, and elsewhere--and I would ask, Are there many\r\ninstances of the care that has preserved for us, almost intact, effigies\r\nand “weepers” like those at Earls Colne?\r\n\r\nA. H.\r\n\r\n_October 4._\r\n\r\n\r\nANCIENT AND MODERN BRITONS: A QUESTION FOR ANTIQUARIES.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In the _St. James’s Gazette_ of July 10, there is a review of a\r\nrecently published book named “Ancient and Modern Britons.” Not having\r\neven seen the book, I can only say of it that, _on the showing of its\r\ncritic_, the author’s opinions seem little to accord with mine. But let\r\nthat pass; my present object is to ask you whether the reviewer has done\r\nwell in writing the following sentences: “In Aberdeenshire there is a\r\nstone--the ‘Newton Stone’--on which there are two inscriptions; one in\r\nOgham digits and another (according to the best authorities) in debased\r\nRoman minuscular letters. Lord Southesk has lately propounded a theory\r\nto the effect that these inscriptions ‘form a compound of Oriental and\r\nWestern ideas, beliefs, and languages.’ This explanation probably amused\r\nthe Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, to whom it was originally\r\nsubmitted; but to the author of ‘Ancient and Modern Britons’ it seems a\r\nbrilliant suggestion.”\r\n\r\nHad the reviewer read the paper (extending over some twenty-five pages)\r\nwhich the society referred to has done me the honour to publish in its\r\nlast volume of “Proceedings,” he could hardly have spoken of it so\r\ndiscourteously; he would have recognised in it, I venture to think, a\r\nresult of careful study, far enough removed from wild and hasty\r\ntheorising. Allow me the favour of sufficient space in your columns to\r\nexplain and vindicate my position in this matter. First, as regards the\r\nOgham Inscription. The attempts to read this have been few and\r\nunsatisfactory. My own reading--independently gained, and different from\r\nprevious versions--being known to Professor Rhys, he has authorised me\r\nto say that he agrees with it as to every digit, except the three marked\r\ndoubtful in my own diagram. This concurrence only applies to the literal\r\narrangement (a matter of some difficulty), the question of\r\ninterpretation being reserved; but it is nevertheless an important and\r\nmuch valued aid. Secondly: as regards the main inscription, it is going\r\nrather far to say that the “best authorities” pronounce it to be in\r\n“debased Roman minuscular letters,” considering the great differences of\r\nopinion as to its nature that continue to exist; some fifteen attempts\r\nat decipherment having been made, many of them by distinguished scholars\r\nstill (or lately) living. The Latin version by Dr. Whitley Stokes is\r\nprobably that referred to by the reviewer, being one of the latest. But\r\nthere is nothing to show that it is, or ought to be, accepted as final.\r\nBesides other possible defects, it confessedly assigns no recognisable\r\nmeaning to five of the letters. Moreover, it differs from any\r\nconceivable rendering of the Ogham legend. This is not fatal to it, but\r\nit gives the advantage to a rival version which reconciles the two\r\ninscriptions. It should also be noted that no perfectly accurate copy of\r\neither inscription has been hitherto published.\r\n\r\nMy own conclusions, after months passed in the comparison of alphabets\r\nand other study, were as follows: (1) That the characters are Greek,\r\nresembling those in the Irish-Latin MSS. of the fifth to the seventh\r\ncentury A.D., described by Mr. Westwood as “singular formed Irish-Greek\r\nletters, in which capitals and minuscules are strangely mingled\r\ntogether” (Pal. Sac. Pict.; see there Greek Pater Noster in Book of\r\nArmagh); also, in some cases, resembling the letters of the alphabet on\r\nthe Kilmalkedar stone, in Ireland--characters described by Dr. Petrie as\r\n“Græco-Roman or Byzantine characters of the fourth or fifth century\r\nA.D.” (Ec. Arc. of Ir., p. 134). This assignment of the letters may be\r\naccepted without necessarily adopting my version of the inscription, as\r\nsome of the characters severally resemble more than one letter. (2) That\r\nthe first half of the inscription is Celtic, sepulchral, and nearly\r\nidentical with the Ogham legend on the same stone. (3) That the second\r\nhalf (and therein lies the ridicule, if ridicule there be) is religious\r\nor mythological, and embodies sacred names belonging to the Mithraic\r\nworship. Mithraism, as developed under the Roman emperors, was eminently\r\na compound creed--one which undoubtedly sought to unite “Oriental and\r\nWestern ideas and beliefs” (to cite your reviewer’s quotation from\r\n“Ancient and Modern Britons”--ostensibly from me, but not so), though\r\nnot, of course, aiming to unite “languages.” It is only as regards\r\ncertain mythological names or titles that the Newton inscriptions are\r\nnot (on my view of them) entirely Celtic. Mithraic remains have been\r\nlargely found in England, especially in the north; there are apparent\r\nreferences to its mysteries in the poems of the Welsh bards; and in\r\nScotland some of the, as yet unexplained, symbols on the sculptured\r\nstones appear to belong to the same system.\r\n\r\nI claim no right to dogmatise on these subjects; but I do claim to have\r\nbestowed real work on them, and it is unseemly that the results of my\r\nlabour should be ridiculed by one who has not taken the trouble to find\r\nout in what they consist. Is it more improbable that remains of\r\nMithraism should exist in Scotland than in other parts of Britain\r\naccessible to Roman influences? The improbability lies the contrary way.\r\nWhy should there be more folly in seeking for traces of Paganism than in\r\nseeking for traces of Christianity among the earlier antiquities of\r\nBritain? The reproach surely rests with those who in such cases\r\nformulate extreme opinions as to the universal presence or absence of\r\none of these religious elements, and refuse to see anything that\r\nantagonises their enthusiasms or prejudices. In conclusion, allow me add\r\nthat, even if they disapproved of my paper on the Newton Stone (which I\r\nhave no reason to suppose), the Scottish Society of Antiquaries have not\r\nonly printed it in full, with my own illustrative diagrams, but are now\r\nprinting another paper of mine, of at least equal length, on the whole\r\nof the Ogham inscriptions of Scotland--one which I sincerely hope may\r\nprove not altogether unworthy of the honour thus conferred on it.\r\n\r\nSOUTHESK.\r\n\r\n_Kinnaird Castle, Brechin, N.B._\r\n\r\n\r\n_TO CORRESPONDENTS._\r\n\r\nTHE Editor declines to pledge himself for the safety or return of MSS.\r\nvoluntarily tendered to him by strangers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBooks Received.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

He probably\r\n knew something, though little, of Winchester, and nothing whatever\r\n of Somerset. However, dates simply make it impossible, seeing that\r\n Winchester was conquered by the Saxons in 515.\r\n\r\n [3] William of Malmesbury.\r\n\r\n [4] Avilion or Avalon is the ancient name for Glastonbury.\r\n\r\n [5] Mallory’s King Arthur, edited by Caxton.\r\n\r\n [6] MS. Dodsw. 47, f. 151.\r\n\r\n [7] R. de Camvill.\r\n\r\n [8] f.m.=feudum militis, a knight’s fee, same in meaning as 1 m., one\r\n knight.\r\n\r\n [9] Preface to “Pastoral Book.”\r\n\r\n [10] See also, for Mr. Freeman’s view, “English Towns and Districts,”\r\n p. 230: “Chester has no Roman remains _in situ_ to be compared to the\r\n _New Port_ of Lincoln;” and p. 394, “There is [at Colchester] nothing\r\n to set even against the New Port of Lincoln.” So, too, Mr. G. T. Clark\r\n states that it “still bears a name which must have descended from\r\n the time when it was first erected, ... and is called the New-port”\r\n (“Military Architecture,” ii. 191).\r\n\r\n [11] “The abiding Latin name of the gate, the _Nova Porta_, of itself\r\n goes far to show that there could have been no long gap between Roman\r\n or British and English occupation.” (English Towns and Districts, p.\r\n 200.)\r\n\r\n [12] See Mr. J. Pickford’s article on this old mansion, vol. v. p. 190.\r\n\r\n [13] “Southwell Minster: an Account of the Collegiate and Cathedral\r\n Church of Southwell, Architectural, Archæological, and Historical.” By\r\n Grevile Mairis Livett, M.A. Southwell: John Whittingham, 1883.\r\n\r\n [14] Though his inspirations were, it is said, first noted in prose.\r\n\r\n [15] I do not mean by this that _every_ human being is possessed of\r\n the faculty, but that _some_ men are, though it may be in a proportion\r\n of perhaps less than one in 100 millions.\r\n\r\n [16] The passage is cited by the Encyclopædists to bring Nostradamus\r\n into discredit, and is said to occur in the first volume of Gassendi’s\r\n “Physics.” I have no doubt it is there, but I have not thought it\r\n worth while to hunt through the six volumes folio of his collected\r\n works to ascertain the fact. Bouys in his “Nouvelles Considerations”\r\n says justly enough that the learned writers of the Encyclopædia would\r\n take the testimony of Jean-Baptiste Suffren without any hesitation as\r\n a thing not to be doubted; it would only be works that should be of\r\n the most sacred authority to everyone else that they would think of\r\n calling in question.\r\n\r\n [17] To show the probability that they would not all prove erroneous,\r\n it may amuse the reader to learn that Sir Thomas Brown did once in\r\n sport attempt a prophecy in reply to an ancient metrical one that had\r\n been sent him by a friend:--\r\n\r\n    “When new England shall trouble new Spain,\r\n     When Jamaica shall be Lady of the Isles and the main;\r\n     When Spain shall be in America hid,\r\n     And Mexico prove another Madrid;\r\n     When Mahomet’s ships on the Baltic shall ride,\r\n     And Turks shall labour to have ports on that side;\r\n     When Africa shall no more sell out her blacks,\r\n     To make slaves and drudges to the American tracts;\r\n     When Batavia the old shall be subdued by the new;\r\n     When a new drove of Tartars shall China subdue;\r\n     When America shall cease to send out its treasure,\r\n     But employ it at home for American pleasure;\r\n     When the new world shall the old invade,\r\n     Nor count them their lords but their fellows in trade;\r\n     When shall almost pass to Venice by land,\r\n     Not in deep water, but from sand to sand;\r\n     When Nova Zembla shall be no stay\r\n     Unto them that pass to or from Cathay;\r\n     Then think strange things are come to light,\r\n     Whereof but few have had a foresight.”\r\n\r\n Now the most unlikely part of the above to be realised was the ships\r\n of Mahomet appearing in the Baltic, but, nevertheless, it happened.\r\n “Mahomet’s ships” did actually ride in the Baltic, manned by the\r\n corsairs of Algiers, in 1819, so the line was verified, though not as\r\n Brown intended. (_Quarterly Review_, xxvi. 191.)\r\n\r\n [18] Van Hasselt.\r\n\r\n [19] The name is Flemish: each consonant, therefore, must be sounded,\r\n but the second vowel is short, Dam-Dam-mĕ.\r\n\r\n [20] The Zwyn has entirely disappeared from the map of Europe.\r\n Guide-books say that “mention is made of the harbour of the Zwyn in\r\n the laws of the Saxon Ethelred.” I cannot endorse this statement,\r\n having failed to confirm it on examination. The Zwyn was the scene of\r\n the great maritime victory won by Edward III. over the French fleet in\r\n 1340, the harbinger of the naval supremacy of England.\r\n\r\n [21] paper read at the Congress of the Archæological Institute at\r\n Lewes, July, 1883.\r\n\r\n [22] Mrs. Siddons’ maternal grandfather. For the gloves and the\r\n story I leave them upon the conscience of the glazier, hereby\r\n declaring myself ready to prove the utter falsehood of the whole\r\n narrative.--ED.\r\n\r\n [23] Of this John Ward I read that he was a well-known performer in\r\n the time of Betterton, and was in 1723 the original Hazeroth in the\r\n tragedy of “Mariamne,” by Elijah Fenton, the friend of Pope. It was\r\n for his benefit that Mrs. Woffington at Dublin, in 1760, played Sir\r\n Harry Wildair for the first time, and he was the maternal grandfather\r\n of Mrs. Siddons, his daughter having married Mr. Roger Kemble, and\r\n the great Kembles being the issue of that union. In considering the\r\n probabilities of this story, we may therefore conclude that John Ward\r\n was not likely to play a huge practical joke upon Garrick. We may\r\n further assume that he was a man of the world, not over credulous, or\r\n to be imposed upon with ease.--S. W. B.\r\n\r\n [24] In his interesting remarks on the reduplication of synonyms, Mr.\r\n Isaac Taylor gives us a marked example in the instance of Brindon\r\n Hill, in Somerset, where “we have first the Cymric _bryn_, a hill.\r\n To this was added _dun_, a Saxonised Celtic word, nearly synonymous\r\n with _bryn_; and the English word _hill_ was added when neither _bryn_\r\n nor _dun_ were any longer significant words.” Thus, in fact, we are\r\n presented with a threefold instance of the kind in question. (See\r\n “Words and Places,” p. 141.)\r\n\r\n [25] This is actually represented in an accompanying map by a small\r\n drawing clearly showing the usual form of the arched Roman gate.\r\n\r\n [26] Camden’s “Britannia,” by Gibson, 1695, p. 855.\r\n\r\n [27] “History of the Anglo-Saxons,” by Sharon Turner, 1823, vol. iii.\r\n p. 224.\r\n\r\n [28] From the _Entertaining Magazine_, March, 1814.\r\n\r\n [29] The heads of the arrows are formed of flint.\r\n\r\n [30] A large knife, of a metal resembling brass, was the only\r\n implement of a metallic nature discovered in the barrow; it might,\r\n therefore, be supposed to have been a present to the British chief\r\n from the ‘princely merchants’ of Phœnicia.\r\n\r\n [31] The Roman road, raised on flints, goes close to the barrow, and\r\n deviates from the straight line on purpose to avoid it: a proof of the\r\n antiquity of the barrow and the veneration of the Romans for the dead.\r\n\r\n [32] _Hesus_ and _Taranis_, Celtic Deities, of the same character as\r\n Woden and Thor in the Saxon mythology.\r\n\r\n                  “Horrensque suis altaribus Hesus\r\n    Et Taranis, Scythicæ non mitior ara Dianæ.”--LUCAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n [33] Even in the time of Lucan it was deserted, for he speaks of\r\n “desertæ mœnia Lunæ.” (See Lucan, Phars. i. 586.) Bulwer, in his “King\r\n Arthur” (Book iv. stanza 14), writes:--\r\n\r\n                        “That old friendly soil\r\n      Whose ports, perchance, yet glitter with the prows\r\n    Of Punic ships, when resting from their toil\r\n      In Luna’s gulf, the seabeat crews carouse.”\r\n\r\n\r\n [34] Calendar of State Papers, Report on the foundation, history, and\r\n present state of St. Katherine’s Hospital.\r\n\r\n [35] See _ante_, pp. 3-5.\r\n\r\n [36] Freeman, Norm.

It is, however, but right to\r\n state that Mr. Freeman may here not have meant what his words would\r\n imply. He was probably thinking not of the whole “name” but of the\r\n “Glou-,” for elsewhere he observes, “Here and there a place keeps a\r\n Welsh name ... like _Gloucester_ and Winchester” (English Towns and\r\n Districts, p. 35), and even goes so far as to proclaim, exactly as I\r\n am myself doing, that “Our endless _chesters_ everywhere proclaim the\r\n fact of their former Roman occupation. But they proclaim it by the\r\n name given to it by foreign conquerors, not by any title which the\r\n place bore while the rule of Rome lasted.” (_Ibid._ p. 192.)\r\n\r\n [41] Roman Britain (S.P.C.K.), p. 180.\r\n\r\n [42] Casters and Chesters, p. 423.\r\n\r\n [43] _Ibid._ p. 419.\r\n\r\n [44] Casters and Chesters, p. 434.\r\n\r\n [45] Casters and Chesters, p. 422.\r\n\r\n [46] _Ibid._, p. 421. So Mr. Freeman, in the case of Chester, claims\r\n that “the name is historically a contraction” (English Towns and\r\n Districts, p. 231).\r\n\r\n [47] This is the case of “Newport Gate,” from my point of view, over\r\n again (_ante_, p. 24).\r\n\r\n [48] Stubbs, Const. Hist. i. 104.\r\n\r\n [49] P.S.--As it would seem, from the letter of “A. H.” (_ante_, p.\r\n 47) that there are people who believe that the Anglo-Saxon “port” was\r\n the “equivalent of haven,” or sea-port (_portus_), it may be worth\r\n referring to the English Chronicle, where, so late as 1088, Worcester,\r\n the town most distant from the sea, is spoken of distinctively as a\r\n “port.” The passage is thus rendered by Mr. Freeman: “They came to\r\n the port itself, and would then the port burn.” (W. Rufus, i. 47,\r\n 48.) In Earle’s “Philology of the English Tongue” (3rd Ed.) it is\r\n explained that by _port_ was “signified, in Saxon times, just ‘a town,\r\n a market-town.’ This is the sense of it in such compounds as Newport\r\n Pagnell” (p. 19). It is, however, erroneously there too “derived\r\n from the Latin _porta_, a gate.” It is also worth noting that in the\r\n _Quarterly Review_, No. 315 (July, 1884), p. 9, it is asserted that “a\r\n port-reeve is the equivalent of a shire-reeve (!): and has nothing to\r\n do with _portus_, but much with _porta_”--the very error of which, I\r\n hope, I have now effectually disposed.\r\n\r\n [50] This _jeu d’esprit_ was written by Sir Joshua Reynolds to\r\n illustrate a remark which he had made--“That Dr. Johnson considered\r\n Garrick as his property, and would never suffer anyone to praise or\r\n abuse him but himself.” In the first of these supposed dialogues, Sir\r\n Joshua himself, by high encomiums upon Garrick, is represented as\r\n drawing down upon him Johnson’s censure; in the second, Gibbon, by\r\n taking the opposite side, calls forth his praise.\r\n\r\n It should be added that the _jeu d’esprit_ was printed privately in\r\n 1816, given by Lady Thomond to Mrs. Gwynne, who gave it to a lady\r\n connected with the family of Wynn of Wynnstay.\r\n\r\n [51] The substance of this sermon, in consequence of a strongly\r\n expressed wish, will form the subject of a paper in our next number.\r\n\r\n [52] In all these quotations I give the words in the old-fashioned\r\n version of Garencières, for the French would scarcely be understood by\r\n the general reader.\r\n\r\n [53] Sometimes, even as at iii. 87, he particularly says that\r\n the warning he gives will be utterly useless to prevent the evil\r\n announced: “Sang nagera, _captif ne me croiras_.”\r\n\r\n [54] Compare this with the demon of Socrates.\r\n\r\n [55] In these quatrains I quit Garencières, and translate the\r\n rendering and Scholia of Le Pelletier.\r\n\r\n [56] This reading of _Lonole_ is from the _Editio princeps_ of Pierre\r\n Rigaud (Lyon. 1558. Avec les varientes de Benoist Rigaud. Lyon. 1568).\r\n Others read: “_Doudlé_ donra topique.” Garencières reads _Londre_.\r\n\r\n [57] _Donra_ is for _donnera_.\r\n\r\n [58] _Topique_ simply stands for the common-places of writing, and\r\n _Lonole_ is said by Le Pelletier to be the anagram of _Olleon_, or\r\n Ολλὑων = Destroyer.\r\n\r\n [59] After the death of Elizabeth he became James I.\r\n\r\n [60] _Dechassé_ is a Latin form, and stands for _chassé_ simply.\r\n\r\n [61] _Par ire_ equals _per iram_, by reason of (popular) fury.\r\n\r\n [62] _Tracer_ is an old word equivalent to _faire chemin_, or as we\r\n still say in English, to _trace a path_.\r\n\r\n [63] _Contre_ equals “aupres a côté de.”\r\n\r\n [64] Holland was detached from the Low Countries in 1579. Antwerp\r\n stood on Spanish territory on the very confines of Holland. Philip IV.\r\n made every possible effort to subdue Holland, and did not give over\r\n till the Treaty of Westphalia, which established its independence in\r\n 1648, one year before the decapitation of Charles I.\r\n\r\n [65] This expression occurs again, Century x. quatrain 7: “L’Isle\r\n Britanne par vin sel en soucy.” Wine figuratively standing for heat\r\n and courage, or force; whilst salt may represent wisdom, for its\r\n incorruptibility as well as wit for its pungency.\r\n\r\n [66] _Macelin_; Latin, _marcellum_; Italian, _marcellaio_, butcher.\r\n\r\n [67] 1588 is the date of the destruction of Philip II.’s _Invincible\r\n Armada_ by storms and by Drake in Cadiz Bay. From that time the\r\n maritime supremacy of England dates, and, according to Nostradamus,\r\n it is to last more than three centuries, but not four. It culminated\r\n with the death of Nelson at Trafalgar, and the tale of that event\r\n still stirs the soul to heroism, and to that still more sacred thing,\r\n a sense profound of duty. But all that has happened since seems like a\r\n slow toning down to gradual nothingness. In four years the bare three\r\n centuries will stand completed. An Englishman may ask, I think, with\r\n some emotion, how much the _plus_ stands for.\r\n\r\n [68] This paper is the substance of a sermon preached in the parish\r\n church of St. Mary, Tenby, on Sunday, September 6, 1884, before the\r\n Congress of the British Archæological Association, from the text\r\n Jeremiah vi. 16: “Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and see,\r\n and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein,\r\n and ye shall find rest for your souls.”\r\n\r\n [69] Mr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\n [70] Max Müller, “Science of Religion.”\r\n\r\n [71] “Plutarch: His Life, his Lives, and his Morals,” by Archbishop\r\n Trench, p. 95.\r\n\r\n [72] Discovered in 1779, now in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n [73] A.D. 627.\r\n\r\n [74] Bede’s Ecclesiastical History, by Dr. Giles, pp. 95, 96.\r\n\r\n [75] Arles, 314 A.D.; Sardiæ 347; Ariminum 363.\r\n\r\n [76] The Editor has learnt at the last moment that this Jeu d’Esprit\r\n is to be found in a work by Miss L. Hawkins. It came to the Editor’s\r\n hands in MS., in a private note-book formerly belonging to a member of\r\n the family of Wynn, of Wynnstay.\r\n\r\n [77] See ANTIQUARIAN MAGAZINE, vol. i. p. 78.\r\n\r\n [78] See the frontispiece to the present number.\r\n\r\n [79] These pyramids are minutely described by William of Malmesbury.\r\n\r\n [80] Speed.

The dates show that it was during Richard I.’s reign, under\r\n Henry de Soliaco.\r\n\r\n [81] Almost certainly Henry de Soliaco, in whose abbey the remains\r\n were discovered.
