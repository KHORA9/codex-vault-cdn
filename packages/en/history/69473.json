The subject\r\nappeared at that time to excite considerable interest. The article was\r\ntranslated into French, and, in an abridged form, into Italian; and I\r\nreceived through the editor, from persons entirely unknown to me, more\r\nthan one suggestion that I should complete the biography, accompanied by\r\noffers of additional information for the purpose.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the notices of the Cardinal on which that article was\r\nfounded, and which at that time comprised all the existing materials\r\nfor a biography, appeared to me, with all their interest, to want the\r\nprecision and the completeness which are essential to a just estimate of\r\nhis attainments. I felt that to judge satisfactorily his acquaintance\r\nwith a range of languages so vast as that which fame ascribed to\r\nhim, neither sweeping statements founded on popular reports, however\r\nconfident, nor general assertions from individuals, however distinguished\r\nand trustworthy, could safely be regarded as sufficient. The proof of his\r\nfamiliarity with any particular language, in order to be satisfactory,\r\nought to be specific, and ought to rest on the testimony either of\r\na native, or at least of one whose skill in the language was beyond\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the interest with which the subject seemed to be\r\ngenerally regarded, led me to hope that, by collecting, while they\r\nwere yet recent, the reminiscences of persons of various countries and\r\ntongues, who had known and spoken with the Cardinal, it might be possible\r\nto lay the foundation of a much more exact judgment regarding him than\r\nhad hitherto been attainable.\r\n\r\nA short inquiry satisfied me that, although scattered over every part\r\nof the globe, there were still to be found living representatives of\r\nmost of the languages ascribed to the Cardinal, who would be able, from\r\ntheir own personal knowledge, to declare whether, and in what degree, he\r\nwas acquainted with each; and I resolved to try whether it might not be\r\npossible to collect their opinions.\r\n\r\nThe experiment has involved an extensive and tedious correspondence;\r\nmany of the persons whom I have had to consult being ex-pupils of the\r\nPropaganda, residing in very distant countries; more than one beyond the\r\nrange of regular postal communication, and only accessible by a chance\r\nmessage transmitted through a consul, or through the friendly offices of\r\na brother missionary.\r\n\r\nFor the spirit in which my inquiries have been met, I am deeply grateful.\r\nI have recorded in the course of the narrative the names of many to\r\nwhom I am indebted for valuable assistance and information. Other\r\nvalued friends whom I have not named, will kindly accept this general\r\nacknowledgment.\r\n\r\nThere is one, however, to whom I owe a most special and grateful\r\nexpression of thanks—his Eminence the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster.\r\nFrom him, at the very outset of my task, I received a mass of anecdotes,\r\nrecollections, and suggestions, which, besides their great intrinsic\r\ninterest, most materially assisted me in my further inquiries; and\r\nthe grace of the contribution was enhanced by the fact, that it was\r\ngenerously withdrawn from that delightful store of Personal Recollections\r\nwhich his Eminence has since given to the public; and in which his\r\nbrilliant pen would have made it one of the most attractive episodes.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the autographs, also, which appear in the sheet of\r\nfac-similes, I owe to his Eminence. Others I have received from friends\r\nwho are named in the Memoir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PREFACE,                                                     pp. v-vii.\r\n\r\n                          INTRODUCTORY MEMOIR.\r\n\r\n          ANCIENT PERIOD:—\r\n\r\n      History of Linguists little known—Legendary Linguists—The\r\n    Jews—The Asiatics—The Greeks—Mithridates—Cleopatra—The\r\n    Romans—Prevalence of Greek under the Empire—The Early\r\n    Christians—Decline of the Study—Separation of the two\r\n    Empires—The Crusaders—Frederic II—The Moorish Schools\r\n    in Spain—Council of Vienne—Roderigo Ximenes—Venetian\r\n    travellers—Fall of Constantinople—Greeks in\r\n    Italy—Complutensian Polyglot,                                 pp. 5-18.\r\n\r\n          MODERN PERIOD:—\r\n\r\n      I. _Linguists of the East._ Dragomans—Genus Bey—Jonadab\r\n    Alhanar—Interpreters in the Levant—Ciceroni at Mecca—Syrian\r\n    Linguists—The Assemani—Greeks—Armenians—The Mechitarists,    pp. 18-24.\r\n\r\n      II. _Italian Linguists._ Pico della Mirandola—Teseo\r\n    Ambrosio—Pigafetta—Linguistic Missionary\r\n    Colleges—The Propaganda—Schools of the Religious Orders—\r\n    Giggei—Galani—Ubicini—Maracci—Podestà—Piromalli—Giorgi—De\r\n    Magistris—Finetti—Valperga de Galuso—The De Rossis,          pp. 25-34.\r\n\r\n      III. _Spanish and Portuguese Linguists._ Fernando di\r\n    Cordova—Covilham—Libertas Cominetus—Arias Montanus—Del\r\n    Rio—Lope de Vega—Missionaries—Antonio Fernandez—Carabantes—\r\n    Pedro Paez—Hervas-y-Pandura,                                 pp. 34-41.\r\n\r\n      IV. _French Linguists._\r\n    Postel—Polyglot-Pater-Nosters—Scaliger—Le\r\n    Cluse—Peiresc—Chasteuil—Duret—Bochart—Picquet—Le Jay—De la\r\n    Croze—Renaudot—Fourmont—Deshauterayes—De Guignes—Diplomatic\r\n    affairs in the Levant—De Paradis, Langlés—Abel Remusat—Modern\r\n    School, Julien, Bournouf, Renan, Fresnel, the d’Abbadies,    pp. 41-58.\r\n\r\n      V. _German, Dutch, Flemish, and Hungarian Linguists._\r\n    Müller—(Regiomontanus)—Bibliander—Gesner—Christmann—Drusius—\r\n    Schultens—Maes—Haecx—Gramaye—Erpen—The\r\n    Goliuses—Hottinger—Kircher—Ludolf—Rothenacker—Andrew\r\n    Müller—Witzen—Wilkins—Leibnitz—Gerard\r\n    Müller—Schlötzer—Buttner—Michaelis—Catholic\r\n    Missionaries—Richter, Fritz, Widmann, Grebmer, Dobritzhofer,\r\n    Werdin—Berchtold, Adelung, Vater, Pallas, Klaproth, Niebuhr,\r\n    Humboldt and his School—Castrén, Rask, Bunsen, Biblical\r\n    Linguists—Hungarian Linguists—Csoma de Körös,                pp. 59-81.\r\n\r\n      VI. _British and Irish Linguists._ Crichton—Andrews—Gregory—\r\n    Castell, Walton, Pocock, Ockley, Sale, Clarke, Wilkins,\r\n    Toland, “Orator” Henley, Carteret, Jones, Marsden, Colebrooke,\r\n    Craufurd, Lumsden, Leyden, Vans Kennedy, Adam Clarke, Roberts\r\n    Jones, Young, Pritchard, Cardinal Wiseman, Browning, Lee,\r\n    Burritt,                                                     pp. 81-99.\r\n\r\n      VII. _Slavonian Linguists._ _Russians_—Scantiness of\r\n    Materials—Early Period—Jaroslav, Boris—The Romanoffs—Beründa\r\n    Pameva, Peter the Great, Catherine I., Mentschikoff,\r\n    Timkoffsky, Bitchourin, Igumnoff, Giganoff, Tchubinoff,\r\n    Goulianoff, Senkowsky, Gretsch, Kazem-Beg—_Poles_—Meninski,\r\n    Groddek, Bobrowski, Albertrandy, Rzewuski,\r\n    Italinski—_Bohemians_—Komnensky, Dobrowsky, Hanka,          pp. 99-110.\r\n\r\n      Miraculous gift of tongues—Royal Linguists—\r\n    Lady-Linguists—Infant Phenomena—Uneducated Linguists,      pp. 110-121.\r\n\r\n                      LIFE OF CARDINAL MEZZOFANTI.\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER I.

We are\r\neasily deceived about a man’s stature until we have seen him by the\r\nside of other men; nor shall we be able to form a just notion of the\r\nlinguistic accomplishments of Cardinal Mezzofanti, or at least to bring\r\nthem before our minds as a practical reality, until we shall have first\r\nconsidered what had been effected before him by other men who attained to\r\ndistinction in the same department.\r\n\r\nI have thought it desirable, therefore, to prefix to his Life a summary\r\nhistory of the most eminent linguists of ancient and modern times. There\r\nis no branch of scholarship which has left fewer traces in literature,\r\nor has received a more scanty measure of justice from history. Viewed in\r\nthe light of a curious but unpractical pursuit, skill in languages is\r\nadmired for a time, perhaps indeed enjoys an exaggerated popularity; but\r\nit passes away like a nine days’ wonder, and seldom finds an exact or\r\npermanent record. Hence, while the literature of every country abounds\r\nwith memoirs of distinguished poets, philosophers, and historians, few,\r\neven among professed antiquarians, have directed their attention to the\r\nhistory of eminent linguists, whether in ancient or in modern times. In\r\nall the ordinary repositories of curious learning—Pliny, Aulus Gellius,\r\nand Athenæus, among the ancients; Bayle, Gibbon, Feyjoo, Disraeli,\r\nand Vulpius, among the moderns—this interesting chapter is entirely\r\noverlooked; nor does it appear to have engaged the attention even of\r\nlinguists or philologers themselves.\r\n\r\nThe following Memoir, therefore, must claim the indulgence due to a first\r\nessay in a new and difficult subject. No one can be more sensible than\r\nthe writer of its many imperfections;—of the probable omission of names\r\nwhich should have been recorded;—of the undue prominence of others with\r\ninferior pretensions; and perhaps of still more serious inaccuracies of\r\na different kind. It is only offered in the absence of something better\r\nand more complete; and with the hope of directing to what is certainly a\r\ncurious and interesting subject, the attention of others who enjoy more\r\nleisure and opportunity for its investigation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe diversity of languages which prevails among the various branches\r\nof the human family, has proved, almost equally with their local\r\ndispersion, a barrier to that free intercommunion which is one of\r\nthe main instruments of civilization. “The confusion of tongues, the\r\nfirst great judgment of God upon the ambition of man,” says Bacon, in\r\nthe Introductory Book of his “Advancement of Learning,” “hath chiefly\r\nimbarred the open trade and intercourse of learning and knowledge.”[1]\r\nPerhaps it would be more correct to say that these two great impediments\r\nto intercourse have mutually assisted each other. The divergency of\r\nlanguages seems to keep pace with the dispersion of the population.\r\nAdelung lays it down as the result of the most careful philological\r\ninvestigations, that where the difficulties of intercourse are such as\r\nexisted among the ancients and as still prevail among the less civilized\r\npopulations, no language can maintain itself unchanged over a space of\r\nmore than one hundred and fifty thousand square miles.[2]\r\n\r\nIt might naturally be expected, therefore, that one of the earliest\r\nefforts of the human intellect would have been directed towards the\r\nremoval of this barrier, and that one of the first sciences to invite\r\nthe attention of men would have been the knowledge of languages. Few\r\nsciences, nevertheless, were more neglected by the ancients.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the early literatures of many of the ancient nations\r\ncontain legends on this head which might almost throw into the shade the\r\ngreatest marvels related of Mezzofanti. In one of the Chinese stories\r\nregarding the youth of Buddha, translated by Klaproth, it is related\r\nthat, when he was ten years old, he asked his preceptor, Babourenou, to\r\nteach him all the languages of the earth, seeing that he was to be an\r\napostle to all men; and that when Babourenou confessed his ignorance\r\nof all except the Indian dialects, the child himself taught his master\r\n“fifty foreign tongues with their respective characters.”[3] A still\r\nmore marvellous tale is told by one of the Rabbinical historians, Rabbi\r\nEliezer, who relates that Mordechai, (one of the great heroes of Talmudic\r\nlegend), was acquainted with seventy languages; and that it was by means\r\nof this gift he understood the conversation of the two eunuchs who were\r\nplotting in a foreign tongue the death of the king.[4] Nor is the Koran\r\nwithout its corresponding prodigy. When the Prophet was carried up to\r\nHeaven, before the throne of the Most High, “God promised that he should\r\nhave the knowledge of all languages.”[5]\r\n\r\nBut when we turn to the genuine records of antiquity, we find no ground\r\nfor the belief that such legends as these have even that ordinary\r\nsubstructure of truth which commonly underlies the fables of mythology.\r\nNeither the Sacred Narratives, nor those of the early profane authors,\r\ncontain a single example of remarkable proficiency in languages.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in the later days of the Jewish people, interpreters\r\nwere appointed in the synagogues to explain the lessons read from the\r\nHebrew Scriptures for the benefit of their foreign brethren; that in\r\nall the courts of the Eastern monarchs interpreters were found, through\r\nwhom they communicated with foreign envoys, or with the motley tribes of\r\ntheir own empire; and that professional interpreters were at the service\r\nof foreigners in the great centres of commerce or travel,[6] who, it\r\nmay be presumed, were masters of several languages. The philosophers,\r\ntoo, who traversed remote countries in pursuit of wisdom, can hardly be\r\nsupposed to have returned without some acquaintance with the languages\r\nof the nations among whom they had voyaged. Solon and Pythagoras are\r\nknown to have visited Egypt and the East; the latter also sojourned for\r\na considerable time in Italy and the islands; the wanderings of Plato\r\nare said to have been even more extensive. Nay, in some instances these\r\npilgrims of knowledge extended their researches beyond the limits of\r\ntheir own ethnographical region. Thus, on the one hand, the Scythian\r\nsages, Anacharsis and Zamolxis, themselves most probably of the Mongol\r\nor Tartar tongue, sojourned for a long time in countries where the\r\nIndo-European family of languages alone prevailed; on the other, the\r\nmerchants of Tyre were in familiar and habitual intercourse with the\r\nItalo-Pelasgic race; and the Phœnician explorers, in their well-known\r\ncircumnavigation of Africa described by Herodotus, must have come\r\nin contact with still more numerous varieties both of race and of\r\ntongue. Nevertheless it may fairly be doubted whether these or similar\r\nopportunities among the ancients, resulted in any very remarkable\r\nattainments in the department of languages. The absence of all record\r\nfurnishes a strong presumption to the contrary; and there is one example,\r\nthat of Herodotus, which would almost be in itself conclusive. This acute\r\nand industrious explorer devoted many years to foreign travel. He visited\r\nevery city of note in Greece and Asia Minor, and every site of the\r\ngreat battles between the Greeks and Barbarians. He explored the whole\r\nline of the route of Xerxes in his disastrous expedition. He visited in\r\nsuccession all the chief islands of the Egean, as well as those of the\r\nwestern coast of Greece. His landward wanderings extended far into the\r\ninterior. He reached Babylon, Ecbatana, and Susa, and spent some time\r\namong the Scythian tribes on the shores of the Black Sea. He resided\r\nlong in Egypt, from which he passed southwards as far as Elephantine,\r\neastwards into Arabia, and westwards through Lybia, at least as far as\r\nCyrene. And yet Dahlmann is of opinion that, with all his industry, and\r\nall the spirit of inquiry which was his great characteristic, Herodotus\r\nnever became acquainted even with the language of Egypt, but contented\r\nhimself with the service of an interpreter.[7]\r\n\r\nIn like manner, it would be difficult to shew, either from the Cyropædia,\r\nor the Expedition of Cyrus, that Xenophon, during his foreign travel,\r\nbecame master of Persian or any kindred Eastern tongue. Nor am I aware\r\nthat there has ever been discovered in the writings of Plato any evidence\r\nof familiarity with the language of those Eastern philosophers from whose\r\nscience he is believed to have drawn so largely.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that the two notable exceptions to this barrenness of\r\neminent linguists which characterizes the classic times, Mithridates\r\nand Cleopatra, should both have been of royal rank. The former, the\r\ncelebrated king of Pontus, long one of the most formidable enemies of\r\nthe Roman name, is alleged to have spoken fluently the languages of all\r\nthe subjects of his empire; an empire so vast, and comprising so many\r\ndifferent nationalities as to throw an air of improbability over the\r\nstory. According to Aulus Gellius,[8] he “was thoroughly conversant”\r\n(_percalluit_) with the languages of all the nations (_twenty-five in\r\nnumber_) over which his rule extended.[9] The other writers who relate\r\nthe circumstance—Valerius Maximus,[10] Pliny,[11] and Solinus—make the\r\nnumber only twenty-two. Some commentators have regarded the story as a\r\ngross exaggeration; and others have sought to diminish its marvellousness\r\nby explaining it of different dialects, rather than of distinct\r\nlanguages. But there does not appear in the narrative of the original\r\nwriters any reason whether for the doubt or for the restriction. Pliny\r\ndeclares that “it is quite certain;” and the matter-of-fact tone in which\r\nthey all relate it, makes it clear that they wished to be understood\r\nliterally. It was the king’s invariable practice, they tell us, to\r\ncommunicate with all the subjects of his polyglot empire directly and in\r\nperson, and “never through an interpreter;” and Gellius roundly affirms\r\nthat he was able to converse in each and every one of these tongues\r\n“with as much correctness as if it were his native dialect.”\r\n\r\nThe attainments of Cleopatra, although far short of what is reported\r\nof Mithridates, are nevertheless described by Plutarch[12] as very\r\nextraordinary. He says that she “spoke most languages, and that there\r\nwere but few of the foreign ambassadors to whom she gave audience through\r\nan interpreter.” The languages which he specifies are those of the\r\nEthiopians, of the Troglodytes (probably a dialect of Coptic), of the\r\nHebrews, of the Arabs, the Syrians, the Medes, and the Persians; but\r\nhe adds that this list does not comprise all the languages which this\r\nextraordinary woman understood.\r\n\r\nNow the very prominence assigned to these examples, and the absence of\r\nall allusion to any other which might be supposed to approximate to them,\r\nmay afford a presumption that they are almost solitary. Valerius Maximus,\r\nin his well-known chapter _De Studio et Industria_, cites the case of\r\nMithridates as a very remarkable example “of study and industry.” It is\r\nhighly probable therefore, that, if he knew any other eminent linguists,\r\nhe would have added their names. Yet the only cases which he instances\r\nare those of Cato learning Greek in his old age, of Themistocles\r\nacquiring Persian during his exile, and of Publius mastering all the five\r\ndialects of Greece during the time of his Prætorship. In like manner,\r\nAulus Gellius has no more notable linguist to produce, in contrast with\r\nMithridates, than the old poet Ennius, who used to boast that he had\r\nthree hearts,[13] because he could speak Greek, Latin, and his rude\r\nnative dialect, Oscan. And Pliny, with all his love of parallels, is even\r\nmore meagre:—he does not recite a single name in comparison with that of\r\nMithridates.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Romans, especially under the early Republic, appear to have been\r\nsingularly indifferent or unsuccessful in cultivating languages; and\r\nthe bad Greek of the Roman ambassadors to Tarentum, for their ridicule\r\nof which the Tarentines paid so dearly, is almost an average specimen\r\nof the accomplishments of the earlier Romans as linguists. Nor can\r\nthis circumstance fail to appear strange, when it is remembered over\r\nhow many different races and tongues the wide domain of Rome extended.\r\nThe very multiplicity of languages submitted to her government would\r\nseem to have imposed upon her public men the necessity of familiarizing\r\nthemselves, even for the discharge of their public office, with at least\r\nthe principal ones among them. But, on the contrary, for a long time they\r\nsteadily pursued the policy of imposing, as far as practicable, upon\r\nthe conquered nationalities the Latin language, at least in public and\r\nofficial transactions.[14]\r\n\r\nAnd, so far as regards the Eastern and Northern languages, this exclusion\r\nwas successfully and permanently enforced at Rome. The slave population\r\nof the city comprised almost every variety of race within the limits of\r\nthe Empire. The very names of the slaves who are introduced in the plays\r\nof Plautus and Terence—Syra, Phœnicium, Afer, Geta, Dorias, &c. (which\r\nare but their respective gentile appellatives)—embrace a very large\r\ncircle of the languages of Asia, Africa, and Northern Europe. And yet,\r\nwith the exception of a single scene in the Pænulus of Plautus, in which\r\nthe well-known Punic speech of Hanno the Carthaginian is introduced,[15]\r\nthere is nothing in either of these dramatists from which we could\r\ninfer that any of the manifold languages of the slave population of\r\nRome effected an entrance among their haughty masters. They were all as\r\ncompletely ignored by the Romans, as is the vernacular Celtic of the\r\nIrish agricultural servant in the midland counties of England.\r\n\r\nBut it was not so for Greek. From the Augustan age onwards, this polished\r\nlanguage began to dispute the mastery with Latin, even in Rome itself.\r\n\r\n    “Græcia capta ferum cepit captorem, et artes\r\n    Intulit agresti Latio—”\r\n\r\napplies to the language, even more than to the arts. In the days of the\r\nRhetorician, Molon, (Cicero’s master in eloquence,) Greek had obtained\r\nthe entrée of the Senate. In the time of Tiberius, its use was permitted\r\neven in forensic pleadings. With the emperors who succeeded,[16] the\r\ntriumph of Greek was still more complete. From Pliny downwards, there is\r\nhardly an author of eminence in the Roman Empire who did not write in\r\nthat language;—Pausanias, Dion, Galen, even the Emperor Marcus Aurelius\r\nhimself, with all the traditionary Roman associations of his name.\r\n\r\nIt was so also with the Christian population and the Christian literature\r\nof Rome. Almost all the Christian writings of the first two centuries\r\nare in Greek. The early Roman liturgy was Greek. The population of Rome\r\nwas in great part a Greek-speaking race. A large proportion of the\r\ninscriptions in the Roman Catacombs are Greek, and some even of the Latin\r\nones are engraved in Greek characters. Nay, the early Christian churches\r\nin Gaul, Vienne, Lyons, and Marseilles, and the few remains of their\r\nliterature which have reached us, are equally Greek.[17]\r\n\r\nIn a word, during the first two centuries of the Christian era, making\r\ndue allowance for the difference of the periods, Greek and Latin held\r\ntowards each other in Rome the same relation which we find between\r\nNorman-French and Saxon in England after the Conquest; and we may safely\r\nsay that, during those centuries, a knowledge of both languages was the\r\nordinary accomplishment of all educated men, and was shared by many of\r\nthe lowest of the population.\r\n\r\nBeyond this limit, however, we read of no remarkable linguists even among\r\nthe accomplished scholars of the Augustan age. No one will doubt that the\r\ntwo Varros may fairly be taken as, in this respect, the most favourable\r\nspecimens of the class. Now neither of them seems to have gone further\r\nthan a knowledge of Greek. Out of the four hundred and ninety books which\r\nMarcus Terentius Varro wrote, there is not one named which would indicate\r\nfamiliarity with any other foreign language.\r\n\r\nThe Neo-Platonists of the second and third centuries, whose researches\r\nin Oriental Philosophy must have brought them into contact with some of\r\nthe Eastern languages, may possibly form an exception to this general\r\nstatement; but, on the whole, in the absence of positive and exact\r\ninformation on the subject, it may not unreasonably be conjectured that,\r\namong the Christian scholars of the second, third, and fourth centuries,\r\nwe might find a wider range of linguistic attainments than among their\r\ngentile contemporaries. The critical study of the Bible itself involved\r\nthe necessity of familiarity, not only with Greek and Hebrew, but with\r\nmore than one cognate oriental dialect besides. St. Jerome, besides\r\nthe classic languages and his native Illyrian, is known to have been\r\nfamiliar with several of the Eastern tongues; and it is not improbable\r\nthat some of the earlier commentators and expositors of the Bible may be\r\ntaken as equally favourable specimens of the Christian linguists.[18]\r\nOrigen’s Hexapla is a monument of his scholarship in Hebrew, and probably\r\nin Syriac and Samaritan. St. Clement of Alexandria was perhaps even a\r\nmore accomplished linguist; for he tells that of the masters under whom\r\nhe studied, one was from Greece, one from Magna Græcia, a third from\r\nCœle-Syria, a fourth from Egypt, a fifth an Assyrian, and a sixth a\r\nHebrew.[19] And St. Gregory Nazianzen expressly relates of his friend St.\r\nBasil, that, even before he came to Athens to commence his rhetorical\r\nstudies, he was already well-versed in many languages.[20]\r\n\r\nFrom the death of Constantine, however, the study began rapidly to\r\ndecline, even among ecclesiastics. The disruption of the Empire naturally\r\ntended to diminish the intercourse between East and West, and by\r\nconsequence the interchange of their languages. It would appear, too, as\r\nif the barbarian conquerors adopted, in favour of their own languages,\r\nthe same policy which the Romans had pursued for Latin. Attila is said\r\nto have passed a law prohibiting the use of the Latin language in his\r\nnewly conquered kingdom,[21] and to have taken pains, by importing native\r\nteachers, to procure the substitution of Gothic in its stead. At all\r\nevents, in whatever way the change was brought about, a knowledge of\r\nboth Greek and Latin, which in the classic times of the Empire had been\r\nthe ordinary accomplishment of every educated man, became uncommon and\r\nalmost exceptional. Pope Gregory the Great, who, bitterly as he has been\r\nassailed as an enemy of letters, must be confessed to have been the\r\nmost eminent Western scholar of his day, spoke Greek very imperfectly;\r\nhe complains that it was difficult, even at Constantinople, to find any\r\none who could translate Greek satisfactorily into Latin;[22] and a still\r\nearlier instance is recorded, in which a pope, in other respects a man\r\nof undoubted ability, was unable to translate the letter of the Greek\r\npatriarch, much less to communicate with the Greek ambassadors, except\r\nthrough an interpreter.[23]\r\n\r\nMore than one, indeed, of the early theological controversies was\r\nembittered through the misunderstandings caused between the East and\r\nWest by mutual ignorance of each other’s language. Pelagius succeeded\r\nin obtaining a favourable decision from the Council of Jerusalem in\r\n415, chiefly because, while his Western adversary, Orosius, was unable\r\nto speak Greek, the fathers of the Council were ignorant of Latin. The\r\nprotracted controversy on the Three Chapters owed much of its inveteracy\r\nto the ignorance of the Westerns[24] of the original language of the\r\nworks whose orthodoxy was impugned; and it is well known that the\r\ncondemnation of the decree of the sixth council on the use of sacred\r\nimages issued by the fathers of Francfort, was based exclusively on a\r\nstrangely erroneous Latin translation of the acts of the council, through\r\nwhich translation alone they were known in Germany and Gaul.[25]\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the Empire of Charlemagne consummated the separation\r\nbetween the Greek and Latin races and their languages. The venerated\r\nnames of Bede and of Alcuin in the Western Church, and the more\r\nquestionable celebrity of the Patriarch Photius in the Eastern,\r\nconstitute a passing exception. But it need hardly be added that they\r\nstand almost entirely alone; and it will readily be believed that,\r\namid the Barbarian irruptions from without, and the fierce intestine\r\nrevolutions, of which Europe was the theatre during the rest of the\r\nearlier mediæval period, even that familiarity with the Greek and\r\noriental languages which we have described, entirely disappeared in the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nThe wars of the Crusades, and the reviving intellectual activity\r\nin which this and other great events of the second mediæval period\r\noriginated, gave a new impulse to the study of languages. Frederic II.,\r\na remarkable example of the union of great intellectual gifts with deep\r\nmoral perversity, spoke fluently six languages, Latin, Greek, Italian,\r\nGerman, Hebrew, and even Arabic.[26] The Moorish schools in Spain began\r\nto be visited by Christian students. In this manner Arabic found its\r\nway into the West; and the intermixture of learned Jews in the European\r\nkingdoms afforded similar opportunities for the cultivation of Hebrew,\r\nwhich were turned to account by many, especially among biblical scholars.\r\nOn the other hand, notwithstanding the contempt for profane learning\r\nwhich breathes through the Koran, the Saracen scholars began to direct\r\ntheir attention to the learning of other creeds, and the languages of\r\nother races. Ibn Wasil, who came into Italy in 1250 as ambassador to\r\nManfred, the son of Frederic II., was reported to be familiar with the\r\nWestern tongues. The Spanish Moors, too, began sedulously to cultivate\r\nGreek. The works of Aristotle, of Galen, of Dioscorides, and many other\r\nGreek writers, chiefly philosophical, were translated into Arabic by\r\nAverroes, Ibn Djoldjol and Avicenna. And the Jewish scholars of that age\r\nwere equally assiduous in the cultivation of Greek. The learned Rabbi\r\nMaimonides, born in Cordova in the early part of the 12th century, was\r\nnot only master of many Eastern tongues, but was also thoroughly familiar\r\nwith the Greek language.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake, however, to imagine that it was among the Moors or\r\nthe Hebrews that the revival of the study of languages first commenced.\r\nAlcuin, in addition to the modern languages with which his sojourn in\r\nvarious kingdoms must have made him acquainted, was also familiar with\r\nLatin, Greek, and Hebrew. Hermann, the Dalmatian, the first translator\r\nof the Koran, was well acquainted with Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic.\r\nThe celebrated Raymond Lully, who was a native of Majorca, was able to\r\nlecture in Latin Greek, Arabic, and perhaps Hebrew;—an accomplishment\r\nespecially wonderful in one who was among the most laborious and\r\nprolific writers of his age, and who left after him, according to some\r\nauthorities, (though this, no doubt, is a great exaggeration), not less\r\nthan a thousand[27] works on the most diversified subjects. At the\r\ninstance of this eminent orientalist, the council of Vienne directed that\r\nprofessorships should be founded in all the great Universities, for the\r\nHebrew, Chaldee, and Arabic languages.[28]\r\n\r\nAn example of, for the period, very remarkable proficiency in modern\r\nlanguages is recorded in the history of the Fourth Lateran Council, 1215.\r\nRoderigo Ximenes,[29] Archbishop of Toledo in the early part of the\r\nthirteenth century, a native of Navarre, but a scholar of the University\r\nof Paris, was one of the representatives of the Spanish Church at that\r\nCouncil. A controversy regarding the Primacy of Spain had arisen between\r\nthe Sees of Toledo and Compostella, which was referred for adjudication\r\nto the bishops there assembled. Ximenes addressed to the council a long\r\nLatin oration in defence of the claim of Toledo; and, as many of his\r\nauditory, which consisted both of the clergy and the laity, were ignorant\r\nof that language, he repeated the same argument in a series of discourses\r\naddressed to the natives of each country in succession; to the Romans,\r\nGermans, French, English, Navarrese, and Spaniards,[30] each in their\r\nrespective tongues. Thus the number of languages in which he spoke was\r\nat least seven, and it is highly probable that he had others at his\r\ndisposal, if his auditory had been of such a nature as to render them\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe taste for the languages and literature of the East received a\r\nfurther stimulus from the foundation of the Christian principalities\r\nat Antioch and Jerusalem, from the establishment of the Latin Empire\r\nat Constantinople, and in general from the long wars in the East, to\r\nwhich the enthusiasm of the age attracted the most enterprising spirits\r\nof European chivalry. The pious pilgrimages, too, contributed to the\r\nsame result. Many of the knights or palmers, on their return from the\r\nEast, brought with them the knowledge, not only of Greek, but of more\r\nthan one of the oriental languages besides. The long imprisonments to\r\nwhich, during the holy wars, and the Latin campaigns against the Turks,\r\nthey were often subjected, supplied another occasion of familiarity with\r\nArabic, Syriac, Turkish, or Persian.\r\n\r\nThe commercial enterprise of the Western Nations, and especially of\r\nthe Venetians and Genoese, was a still more powerful instrument of the\r\ninterchange of languages. Few modern voyagers have possessed more of\r\nthat spirit of travel which is the best aid towards the acquisition of\r\nforeign tongues, than the celebrated Marco Polo. It is hard to suppose\r\nthat he can have returned from his extensive wanderings in Persia, in\r\nTartary, in the Indian Archipelago, and in China and Tibet, without some\r\ntincture of their languages. Still less can this be supposed of his\r\ncountryman, Josaphat Barbaro, who sojourned for sixteen years among the\r\nTartar tribes.[31] It was in the commercial settlements of the Venetians\r\nin the Levant that the profession of interpreters, of which I shall have\r\nto speak hereafter, and which has since become hereditary in certain\r\nfamilies, was originated or brought to perfection.[32]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is only, however, from the revival of letters, properly so called,\r\nthat the history of linguistic studies can be truly said to commence.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Scholars, in the first instance, was chiefly directed\r\ntowards the classical languages and the languages of the Bible. The\r\nGreek scholars who were driven to the West by the Moslem occupation of\r\nConstantinople brought their language, in its best and most attractive\r\nform, to the Universities of Italy. In the Council of Florence, in 1438,\r\nmore than one Italian divine, especially Ambrogio Traversari, was found\r\ncapable of holding discussions with the Greek representatives in their\r\nnative tongue. In like manner, the Jews and Moors, who were exiled from\r\nSpain by the harsh and impolitic measures of Ferdinand and Isabella,\r\ndeposited through all the schools of Europe the seeds of a solid and\r\ncritical knowledge of Hebrew and Arabic and their cognate languages. The\r\nfruits of their teaching may be discerned at a comparatively early period\r\nin the biblical studies of the time. Antonio de Lebrixa published, in\r\n1481, a grammar of the Latin, Castilian and Hebrew languages: and I need\r\nonly allude to the mature and various oriental learning which Cardinal\r\nXimenes found ready to his hand, in the very first years of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, for the compilation of the Complutensian Polyglot. Although\r\nsome of the scholars whom he engaged, as for instance, Demetrius Ducas,\r\nwere Greeks; and others, as Alfonzo Zamora or Pablo Coronell,[33] were\r\nconverted Jews; yet, the names of Lopez de Zuniga, Nunez de Guzman, and\r\nVergara[34] are a sufficient evidence of the success with which the\r\nco-operation of native scholars was enlisted in the undertaking.[35]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom this period the number of scholars eminent in the department\r\nof languages becomes so great, and the history of many among them\r\npresents so frequent points of resemblance, that it may conduce to the\r\ngreater distinctness of the narrative to classify separately the most\r\ndistinguished linguists of each among the principal nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ I. LINGUISTS OF THE EAST.\r\n\r\nAlthough the inquiry must of course commence with the East, the cradle\r\nof human language, unfortunately the materials for this portion of the\r\nsubject are more meagre and imperfectly preserved than any other.\r\n\r\nIn the East indeed, the faculty of language appears, for the most part,\r\nin a form quite different from what we shall find among the scholars of\r\nthe West. The Eastern linguists, with a few exceptions, have been eminent\r\nas mere _speakers_ of languages, rather than scholars even in the loosest\r\nsense of the word.\r\n\r\nAs it is in the East that the office of _Dragoman_ or “interpreter” first\r\nrose to the dignity of a profession, so all the most notable Oriental\r\nlinguists have belonged to that profession.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable specimen of this class occurs in the reign of Soliman\r\nthe Magnificent, and flourished in the early part of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. A most interesting account is given of him, under his Turkish\r\nname of Genus Bey, by Thevet, in that curious repertory—his _Cosmographie\r\nUniverselle_.[36] He was the son of a poor fisherman, of the Island of\r\nCorfu; and while yet a boy, was carried away by pirates and sold as a\r\nslave at Constantinople. Thence he was carried into Egypt, Syria, and\r\nother Eastern countries; and he would also seem to have visited most of\r\nthe European kingdoms, or at least to have enjoyed the opportunity of\r\nintercourse with natives of them all. His proficiency in the languages\r\nboth of the East and West, drew upon him the notice of the Sultan, who\r\nappointed him his First Dragoman, with the rank of Pasha. Thevet (who\r\nwould seem to have known him personally during his wanderings,) describes\r\nhim in his quaint old French, as “the first man of his day for speaking\r\ndivers sorts of languages, and of the happiest memory under the Heavens.”\r\nHe adds, that this extraordinary man “knew perfectly no fewer than\r\nsixteen languages, viz: Greek, both ancient and modern, Hebrew, Arabic,\r\nPersian, Turkish, Moorish, Tartar, Armenian, Russian, Hungarian, Polish,\r\nItalian, Spanish, German, and French.” Genus Bey, was, of course, a\r\nrenegade; but, from a circumstance related by Thevet, he appears to have\r\nretained a reverence for his old faith, though not sufficiently strong to\r\nbe proof against temptation. He was solicited by some bigoted Moslems to\r\nremove a bell, which the Christians had been permitted to erect in their\r\nlittle church. For a time he refused to permit its removal; but at last\r\nhe was induced by a large bribe, to accede to the demand. Thevet relates\r\nthat, in punishment of his sacrilegious weakness, he was struck with that\r\nloathsome disease which smote King Herod, and perished miserably in nine\r\ndays from the date of this inauspicious act.\r\n\r\nIn Naima’s “Annals of the Turkish Empire,” another renegade, a Hungarian\r\nby birth, is mentioned, who spoke fourteen languages, and who, in\r\nconsequence of this accomplishment, was employed during a siege to carry\r\na message through the lines of the blockading army.[37]\r\n\r\nA still more marvellous example of the gift of languages is mentioned by\r\nDuret, in his _Trésor des Langues_ (p. 964)—that of Jonadab, a Jew of\r\nMorocco, who lived about the same period. He was sold as a slave by the\r\nMoors, and lived for twenty-six years in captivity in different parts\r\nof the world. With more constancy to his creed, however, than the Corfu\r\nChristian, he withstood every attempt to undermine his faith or to compel\r\nits abjuration; and, from the obduracy of his resistance, received from\r\nhis masters the opprobrious name _Alhanar_, “the serpent” or “viper.”\r\nDuret says that Jonadab spoke and wrote twenty-eight different languages.\r\nHe does not specify their names, however, nor have I been able to find\r\nany other allusion to the man.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting, if materials could be found for the inquiry,\r\nto pursue this extremely curious subject through the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries, and especially in the military and commercial\r\nestablishments of the Venetians in the Morea and the islands. The race\r\nof Dragomans has never ceased to flourish in the Levant. M. Antoine\r\nd’Abbadie informed me that there are many families in which this office,\r\nand sometimes the consular appointment for which it is an indispensable\r\nqualification, have been hereditary for the last two or three centuries;\r\nand that it is very common to find among them men and women who,\r\nsufficiently for all the ordinary purposes of conversation, speak Arabic,\r\nTurkish, Greek, Italian, Spanish, English, German, and French, with\r\nlittle or no accent. This accomplishment is not confined to one single\r\nnation. Mr. Burton, in his “Pilgrimage to Medinah and Meccah,” mentions\r\nan Afghan who “spoke five or six languages.”[38] He speaks of another,\r\na Koord settled at Medinah, who “spoke five languages in perfection.”\r\nThe traveller, he assures us, “may hear the Cairene donkey-boys shouting\r\nthree or four European dialects with an accent as good as his own;” and\r\nhe “has frequently known Armenians (to whom, among all the Easterns, he\r\nassigns the first place as linguists) speak, besides their mother tongue,\r\nTurkish, Arabic, Persian, and Hindostanee, and at the same time display\r\nan equal aptitude for the Occidental languages.”[39]\r\n\r\nBut of all the Eastern linguists of the present day the most notable\r\nseem to be the ciceroni who take charge of the pilgrims at Mecca, many\r\nof whom speak fluently every one of the numerous languages which prevail\r\nover the vast region of the Moslem. Mr. Burton fell in at Mecca with\r\na one-eyed Hadji, who spoke fluently and with good accent Turkish,\r\nPersian, Hindostani, Pushtu, Armenian, English, French, and Italian.[40]\r\nIn the “Turkish Annals” of Naima, already cited, the learned Vankuli\r\nMohammed Effendi, a contemporary of Sultan Murad Khan, is described as\r\n“a perfect linguist.”[41] Many similar instances might, without much\r\ndifficulty, be collected; nor can it be doubted that, among the numerous\r\ngenerations which have thus flourished and passed away in the East, there\r\nmay have been rivals for Genus Bey, or even for “the Serpent” himself.\r\nBut unhappily their fame has been local and transitory. They were admired\r\nduring their brief day of success, but are long since forgotten; nor is\r\nit possible any longer to recover a trace of their history. They are\r\nunknown,\r\n\r\n    Carent quia vate sacro.[42]\r\n\r\nIt would be a great injustice, however, to represent this as the\r\nuniversal character of the Eastern linguists. On the contrary, it has\r\nonly needed intercourse with the scholars of the West in order to draw\r\nout what appears to be the very remarkable aptitude of the native\r\nOrientals for the scientific study of languages. Thus the learned\r\nPortuguese Jew, Rabbi Menasseh Ben Israel (1604-1657), was not only a\r\nthorough master of the Oriental languages, but was able to write with\r\nease and exactness several of the languages of the West, and published\r\nalmost indifferently in Hebrew, Latin, Spanish, and English.[43] I allude\r\nmore particularly, however, to those bodies of Eastern Christians, which,\r\nfrom their community of creed with the Roman Church, have, for several\r\ncenturies, possessed ecclesiastical establishments in Rome and other\r\ncities of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Syrians had been remarkable, even from the classic times,[44] for\r\nthe patient industry with which they devoted themselves to the labour of\r\ntranslation from foreign languages into their own. Many of the modern\r\nSyrians, however, have deserved the still higher fame of original\r\nscholarship.\r\n\r\nThe Maronite community of Syrian Christians has produced several scholars\r\nof unquestioned eminence. Abraham Echellensis was one of the chief\r\nassistants of Le Jay, at Paris, in the preparation of his Polyglot. His\r\nservices in a somewhat similar capacity at Rome are familiar to all\r\nOriental scholars. But it is to the name of Assemani that the Maronite\r\nbody owes most of its reputation. For a time, indeed, literature would\r\nseem to have been almost an inheritance in the family of Assemani. It has\r\ncontributed to the catalogue of Oriental scholars no less than five of\r\nits members—Joseph Simon, who died in 1768; his nephews, Stephen Evodius\r\nand Joseph Lewis; Joseph Aloysius, who died at Rome in 1782; and Simon,\r\nwho died at Padua in 1821. The first of them is the well-known editor of\r\nthe works of St. Ephrem, and author of the great repertory of Oriental\r\necclesiastical erudition, the _Bibliotheca Orientalis_.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks, with greater resources, and under circumstances more\r\nfavourable, are less distinguished as linguists. John Matthew\r\nCaryophilos, a native of Corfu, who was archbishop of Iconium and\r\nresided at Rome in the early part of the seventeenth century, was a\r\nlearned Orientalist, and, besides several literary works of higher\r\npretension, published some elementary books on the Chaldee, Syriac, and\r\nCoptic languages. But he has few imitators among his countrymen. Leo\r\nAllatius (Allazzi), although a profound scholar, and familiar with every\r\ndepartment of the literature of the West, whether sacred or profane,[45]\r\ncan hardly be considered a linguist in the ordinary sense of the word.\r\nThe same may be said of the many Greek students, as, for instance,\r\nMetaxa, Meletius Syrius, and others, who, during the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries, repaired to the universities of Italy, France,\r\nand even England.[46] It can hardly be doubted, of course, that many of\r\nthem acquired a certain familiarity with the languages of the countries\r\nin which they sojourned, but no traces of this knowledge appear to be\r\nnow discoverable. By far the most notable of them, Cyrillus Lucaris,\r\nthe well-known Calvinistic Patriarch of Constantinople, spoke and\r\nwrote fluently Arabic, Greek, Latin, and Italian; but, if his latinity\r\nbe a fair sample of his skill in the other languages, his place as a\r\nlinguist must be held low indeed.[47] It should be added, however,\r\nthat as polyglot speakers, the Greeks have long enjoyed a considerable\r\nreputation. The celebrated Panagiotes Nicusius[48] (better known by his\r\nItalianized name Panagiotti) obtained, despite all the prejudices of\r\nrace, the post of First Dragoman of the Porte, about the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century; and, from his time forward, the office was commonly\r\nheld by a Greek, until the separation of Greece from the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nMr. Burton’s observation that no natives of the East seem to possess the\r\nfaculty of language in a higher degree than the Armenians, is confirmed\r\nby the experience of all other travellers; and the commercial activity\r\nwhich has long distinguished them, and has led to their establishing\r\nthemselves in almost all the great European centres of commerce, has\r\ntended very much to develope this national characteristic. A far higher\r\nspirit of enterprise has led to the foundation of many religious\r\nestablishments of the Armenians in different parts of Europe, which have\r\nrendered invaluable services, not only to their own native language\r\nand literature, but to Oriental studies generally. Among these the\r\nfathers of the celebrated Mechitarist order have earned for themselves,\r\nby their manifold contributions to sacred literature, the title of\r\nthe Benedictines of the East. The publications of this learned order\r\n(especially at their principal press in the convent of San Lazzaro,\r\nVenice,) are too well known to require any particular notice. Most of\r\ntheir publications regard historical or theological subjects; but many\r\nalso are on the subject of language,[49] as grammars, dictionaries,\r\nand philological treatises. A little series of versions, the Prayers\r\nof St. Nerses in twenty-four languages, printed at their press, is\r\none of the most beautiful specimens of polyglot typography with which\r\nI am acquainted. Among the scholars of the order the names of Somal,\r\nRhedeston, Ingigean, Avedichian, Minaos, and, above all, of the two\r\nAuchers, are the most prominent. One of the latter is best known to\r\nEnglish readers as the friend of Byron, his instructor in Armenian, and\r\nhis partner in the compilation of an Anglo-Armenian grammar. The fathers\r\nof this order generally, however, both in Vienna and in Italy, have long\r\nenjoyed the reputation of being excellent linguists. Visitors of the\r\nArmenian convent of St. Lazzaro at Venice cannot fail to be struck by\r\nthis accomplishment among its inmates. Besides the ordinary Oriental\r\nlanguages, most of them speak Italian, French, and often German. I have\r\nheard from M. Antoine d’Abbadie that, in 1837, Dr. Pascal Aucher spoke no\r\nless than twelve languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ II. LINGUISTS OF ITALY.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent among the nations of the West at the period\r\nimmediately succeeding the Revival of Letters, is of course Italy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first in order, dating from this period, among the linguists of\r\nItaly, is also in many respects the most remarkable of them all;—at least\r\nas illustrating the possibility of uniting in a single individual the\r\nmost diversified intellectual attainments, each in the highest degree\r\nof perfection;—the celebrated Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, son of the\r\nDuke John Francis of that name.[50] He was born in 1463, and from his\r\nchildhood was regarded as one of the wonders of his age. Before he had\r\ncompleted his tenth year, he delivered lectures in civil and canon law,\r\nnot less remarkable for eloquence than for learning. While yet a boy he\r\nwas familiar with all the principal Greek and Latin classics. He next\r\napplied himself to Hebrew; and, while he was engaged in that study,\r\na large collection of cabalistic manuscripts, which were represented\r\nto him as genuine works of Esdras, turned his attention to the other\r\nEastern languages, and especially the Chaldee, the Rabbinical dialect\r\nof Hebrew, and the Arabic. Unfortunately, the strange and fantastic\r\nlearning with which he was thus thrown into contact gave a tinge to his\r\nmind, which appears to have affected all his later studies. His progress\r\nin languages, however, cannot but be regarded as prodigious, when we\r\nconsider the poverty of the linguistic resources of his age. At the age\r\nof eighteen he had the reputation of knowing no fewer than twenty-two\r\nlanguages, a considerable number of which he spoke with fluency. And\r\nwhile he thus successfully cultivated the department of languages, he\r\nwas, at the same time, an extraordinary proficient in all the other\r\nknowledge of his day. His memory was so wonderful as to be reckoned\r\namong the marvellous examples of that gift which are enumerated by the\r\nwriters upon this faculty of the human mind. Cancellieri states that he\r\nwas able, after a single reading, not only to recite the contents of\r\nany book which was offered to him, but to repeat the very words of the\r\nauthor, and even in an inverted order.[51] In 1486 he maintained a thesis\r\nin Rome, _De omni Re Scibili_. Much of the learning which it displayed\r\nwas certainly of a very idle and puerile character; much of it, too, was\r\nthe merest pedantry; but nevertheless it is undeniable that the nine\r\nhundred propositions of which it consisted, comprised every department of\r\nknowledge cultivated at that period. And it is impossible to doubt that,\r\nif Pico’s career had been prolonged to the usual term of human life, his\r\nreputation would have equalled that of the greatest scholars, whether of\r\nthe ancient or the contemporary world. He was cut off, however, at the\r\nearly age of thirty-one.\r\n\r\nIt is not unnatural to suppose that this circumstance, as well as the\r\nrank of Pico, and the singular precocity of his talents, may have led to\r\na false or exaggerated estimate of his acquirements. But, even allowing\r\nevery reasonable deduction on this score, his claim must be freely\r\nadmitted to the character of one of the greatest wonders of his own or\r\nany other age, whether he be considered as a linguist or as a general\r\nscholar.\r\n\r\nMarvellous, however, as is the reputation of Pico della Mirandola,\r\nperhaps the science of language owes more to a less brilliant but more\r\npractical scholar of the same period, Teseo Ambrosio, of the family of\r\nthe Albonesi. He was born at Pavia, in 1469. His admirers have not failed\r\nto chronicle such precocious indications of genius as his composing\r\nItalian, Latin, and even Greek poetry, before he was fifteen; but he\r\nhimself confesses that his proficiency in these studies dates from a\r\nconsiderably later time. He entered the order of Canons Regular of St.\r\nAugustine, and fixed his residence at Rome, where he devoted himself with\r\ngreat assiduity to Oriental studies, and acquired such a reputation,\r\nthat when, in the Lateran Council of 1512, the united Ethiopic and\r\nMaronite Christians solicited the privilege of using their own peculiar\r\nliturgies while they maintained the communion of the Roman church, it was\r\nto him the task of examining those liturgies, and of ascertaining how\r\nfar their teaching was in accordance with the doctrines of the Church,\r\nwas entrusted by the Holy See. Teseo assures us that, at the time when\r\nhe received this commission, he knew little more than the elements\r\nof Hebrew, Chaldee, and Arabic. He set to work with the assistance of\r\na native Syrian (who, however, was entirely ignorant of Latin); and,\r\ncarrying on their communication by mutual instruction, he was soon able\r\nnot only to master the difficulties of these languages, but to set on\r\nfoot what may be regarded as (at least conjointly with the Complutensian\r\nPolyglot) one of the earliest systematic schemes for the promotion of\r\nOriental studies. He had types cast expressly for his projects; and he\r\nhimself prepared the Chaldee Psalter for the press, and repaired to his\r\nnative city of Pavia for the purpose of having it printed. He died (1539)\r\nbefore it was completed;[52] but his types were turned to account by\r\nother scholars. It was with Teseo’s types that William Postel printed two\r\nout of the five Pater Nosters contained in his collection—the Chaldee\r\nand the Armenian.[53] And to him we owe a still greater boon—the first\r\nregular attempt at a Polyglot Grammar; which, however imperfectly,\r\ncomprises the elements of Chaldee, Syriac, Armenian, and ten other\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nThe scholarship of Ambrogio was derived almost entirely from books.\r\nHis countryman, Antonio Pigafetta, enjoyed among his contemporaries a\r\ndifferent reputation, that of considerable skill as a speaker of foreign\r\nlanguages, acquired during his extensive and protracted wanderings.\r\nPigafetta was born at Vicenza, towards the end of the fifteenth century.\r\nIn the expedition undertaken, under the patronage of Charles V., for the\r\nconquest of the Moluccas, by the celebrated Fernando Magellan, the first\r\ncircumnavigator of the globe, one of the literary staff was Pigafetta,\r\nwho acted as historiographer of the expedition, and to whose narrative we\r\nare indebted for all the particulars of it, which have been preserved.\r\n\r\nMarzari describes Pigafetta as a prodigy of learning; and, although this\r\nhas been questioned by later inquirers,[54] there is no reason to doubt\r\nhis acquirements in modern languages at least, and particularly his\r\nskill and success in obtaining information as to the languages of the\r\ncountries which he visited. It is to him[55] we are indebted for the\r\nfirst vocabularies of the language of the Philippine and Molucca islands,\r\nthe merit of which is recognized even by recent philologers.[56]\r\n\r\nIt may be permitted to class with the linguists of Italy, a Corsican\r\nscholar of the same period, Augustine, bishop of Nebia. It is difficult\r\nto pronounce definitively as to the extent of his attainments; but his\r\nskill in the ancient languages, at least, is sufficiently attested\r\nby the polyglot Bible which he published, (containing the Hebrew,\r\nGreek, Chaldee, and Arabic texts,) of which Sixtus of Sienna speaks\r\nin the highest terms; and if we could receive without qualification\r\nthe statement of the same writer, we should conclude that Augustine’s\r\nfamiliarity with modern languages was even more extensive. Sixtus of\r\nSienna describes him as “deeply versed in the languages of all the\r\nnations which are scattered over the face of the earth.”\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the sixteenth century the study of languages\r\nin Italy assumed that practical character in relation to the actual\r\nexigencies of missionary life by which it has ever since been mainly\r\ncharacterized in that country. The Oriental press established at Florence\r\nby the Cardinal Ferdinand de Medici, under the superintendence of the\r\ngreat orientalist Giambattista Raimondi;[57] the opening at Rome of\r\nthe College _De Propaganda Fide_; the foundation of the College of San\r\nPancrazio, for the Carmelite Oriental Missions in 1662; the opening of\r\nsimilar Oriental schools in the Dominican, the Franciscan, Augustinian,\r\nand other orders, for the training of candidates for their respective\r\nmissions in the East; and above all, the constant intercourse with\r\nthe Eastern missions which began to be maintained, gave an impulse to\r\nOriental studies, the more powerful and the more permanent, because it\r\nwas founded on motives of religion; and although we do not meet among\r\nthe missionary linguists that marvellous variety of languages which\r\nexcites our wonder, yet we find in them abundant evidences of a solid and\r\npractical scholarship, whose fruits, if less attractive, are more useful\r\nand more enduring. Nearly all the linguists of Italy from the close of\r\nthe sixteenth century, appear to have been either actually missionaries,\r\nor connected with the colleges of the foreign mission.\r\n\r\nThus, Antonio Giggei, one of the “Oblates of Mary,” taught Persian in\r\na missionary college, at Milan, and, at a later period, taught Arabic\r\nin Florence. Giggei’s _Thesaurus Linguæ Arabicæ_,[58] is still much\r\nesteemed. He wrote besides, a Grammar of Chaldee and of Rabbinical\r\nHebrew, which is still preserved in manuscript in the Ambrosian Library\r\nat Milan; and his translation of a Rabbinical commentary on the\r\nProverbs of Solomon, published at Milan in 1620, is an evidence of his\r\nfamiliarity, not only with Biblical Hebrew, but with the language of the\r\nTalmud in all its successive phases.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, Clemente Galani, the eminent Armenian scholar, spent\r\nno less than twelve years as a missionary in Armenia. On his return to\r\nRome, in 1650, he was such a proficient in the language that he was able,\r\nnot only to write both in Armenian and Latin his well-known work on the\r\nconformity of the creeds of the Armenian and Roman Churches,[59] but also\r\nto deliver theological lectures to the Armenian students in Rome in their\r\nnative tongue.[60]\r\n\r\nTommaso Ubicini was a Franciscan missionary in the Levant.[61] He was\r\nborn at Novara, and entered young into the order of Friar-minors. He\r\nwas named guardian of the Franciscan convent in Jerusalem; and, during\r\na residence of many years, made himself master, in addition to Hebrew\r\nand Chaldee, of the Syriac, Arabic, and Coptic languages. The latter\r\nyears of his life were spent in the convent of San Pietro in Montorio\r\nat Rome; where, besides publishing several works upon these languages,\r\nbe taught them to the students of his order. His great work, _Thesaurus\r\nArabico-Syro-Latinus_ was not published till 1636, several years after\r\nhis death.[62]\r\n\r\nLudovico Maracci, best known to English readers by the copious use to\r\nwhich Gibbon has turned his translation and annotations of the Koran, was\r\none of the missionary “Clerks of the Mother of God.” He was born at Lucca\r\nin 1612, and first obtained notice by the share which he had in the Roman\r\nedition of the Arabic Bible, published in 1671. He taught Arabic for many\r\nyears with great distinction in the University of the Sapienza at Rome.\r\nBut his best celebrity is due to his critical edition of the Koran, and\r\nthe admirable translation which accompanies it.[63] From this repertory\r\nof Arabic learning, Sale has borrowed, almost without acknowledgment, or\r\nrather with occasional depreciatory allusions, all that is most valuable\r\nin his translation and notes.\r\n\r\nOne of Maracci’s pupils, John Baptist Podestà, (born at Fazana early\r\nin the 17th century), is another exception to the general rule. Having\r\nperfected his Oriental studies in Constantinople, he was appointed\r\nOriental Secretary of the Emperor Leopold at Vienna, and attained\r\nconsiderable reputation as Professor of Arabic in that university. He\r\npublished a Grammar of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish; which, however, was\r\nseverely, and, indeed, ferociously, criticised by his contemporary and\r\nrival, Meninski.\r\n\r\nBut Podestà’s contemporary, Paolo Piromalli, was trained in the school\r\nof the Mission. He was a native of Calabria, and became a member of the\r\nDominican order. Piromalli was for many years attached to the Mission\r\nof his order in Armenia, and was eminently successful in reconciling\r\nthe separated Armenians to the Roman Church, having even the happiness\r\nto number among his converts the schismatical patriarch himself. From\r\nArmenia, Piromalli passed into the Missions of Georgia and Persia. He\r\nafterwards went, in the capacity of Apostolic Nuncio, to Poland, with\r\na commission of much importance to the Emperor from the Pope, Urban\r\nVIII. In the course of one of his voyages he was made prisoner by the\r\nAlgerine corsairs, and carried as a slave to Tunis; but he was soon after\r\nredeemed and called to Rome, whence, after he had been entrusted with the\r\nrevision of an Armenian Bible, he was sent back to the East, as Bishop\r\nof Nachkivan in 1655. He remained in this charge for nine years, and was\r\ncalled home as Bishop of Bisignano, where he died in 1667. Piromalli\r\npublished two dictionaries, Persian and Armenian, and several other works\r\nupon these languages.[64]\r\n\r\nThe Augustinian order in Italy, also, produced a linguist, not inferior\r\nin solidity, and certainly superior in range of attainments, to any of\r\nthose hitherto enumerated—Antonio Agostino Giorgi.[65] He was born at\r\nSan Mauro, near Rimini, in 1711, and entered the Augustinian order at\r\nBologna; but Benedict XIV., who, during his occupancy of the see of\r\nBologna, had become acquainted with his merit, invited him to Rome after\r\nhis elevation to the Papacy, and appointed him to a professorship in\r\nthe Sapienza. Father Giorgi occupied this post with much distinction\r\nfor twenty-two years, till his death, in 1797. His acquirements as a\r\nlinguist were more various than those of any of the scholars hitherto\r\nnamed. Besides modern languages, he knew not only Greek, Hebrew, Chaldee,\r\nSamaritan, and Syriac, but also Coptic and (what was at that period a\r\nmuch more rare accomplishment) Tibetan. On the last named language he\r\ncompiled an elementary work for the use of missionaries, which, although\r\nit is not free from inaccuracies, deserves, nevertheless, the highest\r\npraise as a first essay in that till then untried language.\r\n\r\nSimon De Magistris, one of the priests of the Oratory, (born at Ferrara\r\nin 1728) was for many years at the head of the Congregation of the\r\nOriental Liturgies in Rome. He was not only deeply versed in the written\r\nlanguages of the East, but spoke the greater number of them with the same\r\nease and fluency as his native Italian.[66]\r\n\r\nOf the learned Dominican, Finetti, I am unable to offer any particulars.\r\nHis treatise “On the Hebrew and its cognate Languages” is a sufficient\r\nevidence of his ability as an Orientalist; but it contains no indication\r\nof anything beyond the learning which is acquired from books.\r\n\r\nThe same may be said of the Oratorian, Valperga de Galuso. He was born at\r\nTurin in 1737, but lived chiefly in the convents of his order at Naples,\r\nMalta, and Rome. In addition, however, to his accomplishments as an\r\nOrientalist, Padre de Galuso had the reputation of being one of the most\r\nskilful mathematicians of his day. He died in 1815.\r\n\r\nOur information regarding the two De Rossi’s, Ignazio, author of the\r\n_Etymologicum Copticum_, and Giambernardo, of Parma, is more detailed and\r\nmore satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIgnazio de Rossi was born at Viterbo in 1740, and entered the Jesuit\r\nsociety at a very early age. In the schools of Macerata, Spoleto, and\r\nFlorence, he was employed in teaching the Humanities and Rhetoric until\r\nthe suppression of the order in 1773; after which event he repaired\r\nto Rome, and received an appointment as professor of Hebrew in the\r\nUniversity, which he held for thirty years, rejoining his brethren,\r\nhowever, at the first moment of their restoration under Pius VII.\r\n\r\nAs a general scholar, Father De Rossi was one of the first men of his\r\nday. His memory may be ranked among the most prodigious of which any\r\nrecord has been preserved. On one occasion, during the _villeggiatura_\r\nat Frascati, it was tried by a test in some respects the most wonderful\r\nwhich has ever been applied in such cases. A line being selected at\r\npleasure from any part of any one of the four great Italian classics,\r\nDante, Petrarca, Tasso, and Ariosto, De Rossi immediately repeated\r\nthe hundred lines _which followed next in order_ after that which had\r\nbeen chosen; and, on his companions expressing their surprise at this\r\nextraordinary feat (which he repeated several times), he placed the\r\nclimax to their amazement by reciting _in the reverse order_ the hundred\r\nlines immediately _preceding_ any line taken at random from any one of\r\nthe above-named poets.[67] His reputation as an Orientalist was founded\r\nchiefly upon his familiarity with Hebrew and the cognate languages. But\r\nhe was also a profound Coptic scholar; and it is a subject of regret to\r\nmany students of that language that his numerous MSS. connected therewith\r\nhave been suffered to remain so long unpublished. He died in 1824.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Bernardo de Rossi was a linguist of wider range. He was born\r\nat Castel Nuovo, in Piedmont, in 1742, and in his youth was destined\r\nfor the ecclesiastical state. He began his collegiate studies at Turin,\r\nand manifested very early that taste for Oriental literature which\r\ndistinguished his after life. Within six months after he commenced his\r\nHebrew studies, he produced a long Hebrew poem. In addition to the\r\nBiblical Hebrew, he was soon master of the Rabbinical language, of\r\nChaldee, Syriac, and Arabic. He learned besides, by private study, most\r\nof the languages of modern Europe;—his plan being to draw up in each a\r\ncompendious grammar for his own use. In this way he prepared grammars\r\nof the German, English, and Russian languages. In 1769, he obtained an\r\nappointment in the Royal Museum at Turin; but, being invited at the same\r\ntime to undertake the much more congenial office of Professor of Oriental\r\nLanguages in the new University of Parma, he gladly transferred himself\r\nto that city, where he continued to reside, as Professor of Oriental\r\nLiterature, for more than forty years. During the latter half of this\r\nperiod, De Rossi maintained a frequent correspondence with Mezzofanti,\r\nupon the subject of their common studies.[68] From the terms in which\r\nsuch a scholar as Mezzofanti speaks of De Rossi, and the deference with\r\nwhich he appeals to his judgment, we may infer what his acquirements\r\nmust have been. On occasion of the marriage of the Infante of Parma,\r\nCharles Emanuel, he published a polyglot epithalamium,[69]—a Collection\r\nof Hymeneal Odes in various languages—which even still is regarded as\r\nthe most extraordinary of that class of compositions[70] ever produced\r\nby a single individual. It does not belong to my present plan to allude\r\nto the works of De Rossi, or to offer any estimate of his learning; but\r\nwithout entering into any such particulars, or attempting to specify\r\nthe languages with which he was acquainted, it may safely be said that\r\nno Italian linguist from the days of Pico della Mirandola can be\r\ncompared with him, either in the solidity or the extent of his linguistic\r\nattainments. De Rossi died in 1831.[71]\r\n\r\nThe fame of the linguists of Italy during the nineteenth century has been\r\nso completely eclipsed by that of Mezzofanti, that I shall not venture\r\nupon any enumeration of them, though the list would embrace such names as\r\nRossellini, Luzatto, Molza, Laureani, &c. There are few of whom it can be\r\nsaid with so much truth as of Mezzofanti:—\r\n\r\n                Prœgravat artes\r\n    Infra se positas.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ III. SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE LINGUISTS.\r\n\r\nThe catalogue of Spanish linguists opens with a name hardly less\r\nmarvellous than that which I have placed at the head of the linguists\r\nof modern Italy—that of Fernando di Cordova;—one of those universal\r\ngeniuses, whom Nature, in the prodigal exercise of her creative powers,\r\noccasionally produces, as if to display their extent and versatility. He\r\nwas born early in the fifteenth century, and was hardly less precocious\r\nthan his Italian rival, Pico della Mirandola. At ten years of age he\r\nhad completed his courses of grammar and rhetoric. He could recite\r\nthree or four pages of the Orations of Cicero after a single reading.\r\nBefore he attained his twenty-fifth year, he was installed Doctor in all\r\nthe faculties; and he is said by Feyjoo to have been thorough master\r\n(supo con toda la perfeccion) of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Chaldee, and\r\nArabic. Feyjoo adds, that he knew, besides, all the principal European\r\nlanguages.[72] He could repeat the entire Bible from memory. He was\r\nprofoundly versed in theology, in civil and canon law, in mathematics,\r\nand in medicine. He had at his perfect command all the works of St.\r\nThomas, of Scotus, of Alexander of Hales, of Galen, Avicenna, and the\r\nother lights of the age in every department of science.[73] Like the\r\nAdmirable Crichton, too, he was one of the most accomplished gentlemen\r\nand most distinguished cavaliers of his time. He could play on every\r\nknown variety of instrument; he sang exquisitely; he was a most graceful\r\ndancer; an expert swordsman; and a bold and skilful rider; and he was\r\nmaster of one particular art of fence by which he was able to defeat all\r\nhis adversaries, by springing upon them at a single bound of twenty-three\r\nor twenty-four feet! In a word, to adopt the enthusiastic panegyric of\r\nthe old chronicler on whose simple narrative these statements rest, “if\r\nyou could live a hundred years without eating or drinking, and were to\r\ngive the whole time to study, you could not learn all that this young\r\nman knew.”[74] The occasion to which this writer, quoting Monstrelet’s\r\nChronicle,[75] refers was the Royal Fête at Paris in 1445; so that\r\nFernando must have been born about 1425. Of his later history but little\r\nis known. He was sent as ambassador to Rome in 1469, and died in 1480.\r\n\r\nA Portuguese of the same period, Pedro de Covilham, is mentioned by\r\nDamian a Goes in his curious book, _De Ethiopum Moribus_ in terms which,\r\nif we could take them literally, should entitle him to a place among the\r\nlinguists. During the reign of John II. of Portugal (1481-95) Covilham,\r\nwho had already distinguished himself as an explorer under Alfonzo V.,\r\nwas sent, in company with Alfonzo de Payva, in search of the kingdom\r\nof Prester John, which the traditional notions of the time placed in\r\nAbyssinia. Payva died upon the expedition. Covilham, after visiting\r\nIndia, the Persian Gulf, and exploring both the coasts of the Red Sea,\r\nat length reached Abyssinia, where he was received with much distinction\r\nby the King. He married in the country, and obtained large possessions;\r\nbut, in accordance with a law of Abyssinia[76] similar to that which\r\nstill exists in Japan, prohibiting any one who may have once settled in\r\nthe country ever again to leave it, he was compelled to adopt Abyssinia\r\nas a second home. When, therefore, he was recalled by John II., the King\r\nof Abyssinia refused to relinquish him, pleading “_that he was skilled\r\nin almost all the languages of men_,”[77] and that he had made to him,\r\nas his own adopted subject, large grants of land and other possessions.\r\nCovilham, after a residence of thirty-three years, was still alive in\r\n1525, when the embassy under Alvarez de Lima reached Abyssinia.\r\n\r\nVery early in the sixteenth century, I find a notice of a Spanish convert\r\nfrom Judaism, called in Latin “Libertas Cominetus” (_Libertas_ being,\r\nin all probability, but the translation of his Hebrew patronymic,)\r\nwhose acquirements are more precisely defined. He was born at Cominedo,\r\ntowards the close of the fifteenth century, and renounced his creed\r\nabout 1525. His fellow-convert Galatinus, an Italian Jew, and himself\r\nno mean linguist, describes Libertas in his work “_De Arcanis Catholicæ\r\nVeritatis_,” as not only deeply versed in Holy Writ, but master of\r\nfourteen languages.[78] The Biographical Dictionaries and other books of\r\nreference are quite silent regarding him.\r\n\r\nThe name of Benedict Arias Montanus, editor of the so-called “King of\r\nSpain’s Polyglot Bible,” is better known to Biblical students. He was\r\nborn at Frexenal[79] in Estremadura in 1527 and studied in the university\r\nof Alcala, then in the first freshness of the reputation which it owed\r\nto the magnificence of the great Cardinal Ximenes. Montanus entered the\r\norder of St. James, and after accompanying the Bishop of Segovia to the\r\nCouncil of Trent, where he appeared with great distinction, returned\r\nto the Hermitage of Nuestra Señora de los Angelos near Aracena, with\r\nthe intention of devoting himself entirely to study and prayer. From\r\nthis retreat, however, he was drawn by Philip II., who employed him\r\nto edit a new Polyglot Bible on a more comprehensive plan than the\r\nComplutensian Polyglot. On the completion of this task, Philip sought to\r\nreward the learned editor by naming him to a bishopric; but Montanus\r\nhad humility and self-denial enough to decline the honour, and died an\r\nhumble chaplain, in 1598. The estimate formed by his contemporaries of\r\nMontanus’s attainments in languages falls little short of the marvellous.\r\nLe Mire describes him as _omnium fere gentium linguis et literis raro\r\nexemplo excultus_; but we may more safely take his own modest statement\r\nin the preface of his Polyglot, that he knew ten languages.[80]\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Father Martin Del Rio, best known perhaps to English\r\nreaders, since Sir Walter Scott’s pleasant sketch, by his vast work on\r\nDemonology, was also a very distinguished linguist. Del Rio, although of\r\nSpanish parentage, was born at Antwerp in May 1551. His first university\r\nstudies were made at Paris; but he received the Doctor’s degree at\r\nSalamanca, and has merited a place in Baillet’s _Enfans Celebres_, by\r\npublishing an edition of Solinus, with a learned commentary, before he\r\nwas twenty years old.[81] Del Rio’s talents and reputation opened for him\r\na splendid career; but he abandoned all his offices and all his prospects\r\nof preferment, in order to enter the Society of the Jesuits at Valladolid\r\nin 1580. According to Feyjoo,[82] Del Rio knew ten languages; and Baillet\r\nwould appear to imply even more, when he says that he was master of _at\r\nleast_ that number. Del Rio died at Louvain in 1608.\r\n\r\nOne of Del Rio’s most distinguished contemporaries, the celebrated\r\ndramatic poet, Lope de Vega, although his celebrity rests upon a very\r\ndifferent foundation, was also a very respectable linguist, so far, at\r\nleast, as regards the modern languages. The extraordinary fecundity of\r\nthis author, especially when we consider his extremely chequered and\r\nbusy career as a secretary, a soldier, and eventually a priest, would\r\nseem to preclude the possibility of his having applied himself to any\r\nother pursuit than that of dramatic literature. The mere physical labour\r\nof committing to paper (putting composition out of view altogether)\r\nhis _fifteen hundred_ versified plays,[83] three hundred interludes\r\nand sacred dramas[84], ten epic poems, and eight prose novels, besides\r\nan infinity of essays, prefaces, dedications, and other miscellaneous\r\npieces, would appear more than enough to occupy the very busiest human\r\nlife. Yet notwithstanding all this prodigious labour, Lope de Vega\r\ncontrived to find time for the acquisition of Greek, Latin, Italian,\r\nPortuguese, French, and probably English! Well might Cervantes call him\r\n“a Prodigy of Nature!”\r\n\r\nAlthough the missionaries of Spain and Portugal are, as a body, less\r\ndistinguished in the department of languages than those of Italy, yet\r\nthere are some among them not inferior to the most eminent of their\r\nItalian brethren. The great Coptic and Abyssinian scholar, Antonio\r\nFernandez, was a Portuguese Jesuit. He was born at Lisbon in 1566, and\r\nentered the Jesuit society as a member of the Portuguese province of\r\nthe order. After a long preparatory training, he was sent, in 1602,\r\nto Goa, the great centre of the missionary activity of Portugal. His\r\nultimate destination, however, was Abyssinia, which country he reached\r\nin 1604, in the disguise of an Armenian. He resided in Abyssinia for\r\nnearly thirty years, and was charged with a mission to the Pope Paul\r\nIII. and Philip IV. of Spain, from the king, who, under the influence of\r\nthe missionaries, had embraced the Catholic religion. Fernandez set out\r\nwith some native companions in 1615; but they were all made prisoners\r\nat Alaba, and narrowly escaped being put to death; nor was he released\r\nin the end, except on condition of relinquishing this intended mission,\r\nand returning to Abyssinia. On the death of the king, who had so long\r\nprotected them, the whole body of Catholic missionaries were expelled\r\nfrom Abyssinia by the new monarch in 1632; and Fernandez returned,\r\nafter a most chequered and eventful career, to Goa, where he died, ten\r\nyears later, in 1642. Of his acquirements in the Western languages, I\r\nam unable to discover any particulars, but he was thoroughly versed in\r\nArmenian, Coptic, and Amharic or Abyssinian, in both of which last named\r\nlanguages he has left several ritual and ascetic works for the use of the\r\nmissionaries and native children.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish and Portuguese missionaries in America, too, (especially\r\nthose of the Jesuit order) rendered good service to the study of the\r\nnumerous native languages of both continents.[85] Most of the modern\r\nlearning on the subject is derived from their treatises, chiefly\r\nmanuscript, preserved by the Society.\r\n\r\nNor were the other orders less efficient. Padre Josef Carabantes, a\r\nCapuchin of the province of Aragon, (born in 1648) wrote a most valuable\r\npractical treatise for the use of missionaries, which was long a text\r\nbook in their hands.\r\n\r\nOne of the Portuguese missionaries in Abyssinia, Father Pedro Paez, who\r\nsucceeded Fernandez, and whose memory still lingers among the native\r\ntraditions of the people,[86] not only became thorough master of the\r\npopular dialects of the various races of the Valley of the Nile, but\r\nattained a proficiency in Gheez, the learned language of Abyssinia, not\r\nequalled even by the natives themselves.[87] A Franciscan missionary\r\nat Constantinople about the same time, mentioned by Cyril Lucaris, is\r\ndescribed by him as “acquainted with many languages;”[88] but I have not\r\nbeen able to discover his name.\r\n\r\nBy far the most eminent linguist of the Peninsula, however, is the\r\nlearned Jesuit, Father Lorenzo Hervas-y-Pandura. He was born in 1735,\r\nof a noble family, at Horcajo, in la Mancha. Having entered the Jesuit\r\nsociety, he taught philosophy for some years in Madrid, and afterwards in\r\na convent in Murcia; but at length, happily for the interests of science\r\nas well as of religion, he embraced a missionary career, and remained\r\nattached to the Jesuit mission of America, until 1767. On the suppression\r\nof the order, Father Hervas settled at Cesena, and devoted himself to\r\nhis early philosophical studies, which, however, he ultimately, in a\r\ngreat measure, relinquished in order to apply himself to literature and\r\nespecially to philology. When the members of the society were permitted\r\nto re-establish themselves in Spain, Hervas went to Catalonia; but he was\r\nobliged to return to Italy, and settled at Rome, where he was named by\r\nPius VII. keeper of the Vatican Library. In this honourable charge he\r\nremained till his death in 1809.\r\n\r\nFather Hervas may with truth be pronounced one of the most meritorious\r\nscholars of modern times. His works are exceedingly numerous; and, beside\r\nhis favourite pursuit, philology, embrace almost every other conceivable\r\nsubject, theology, mathematics, history, general and local, palæography;\r\nnot to speak of an extensive collection of works connected with the\r\norder, which he edited, and a translation of Bercastel’s History of the\r\nChurch, (with a continuation), executed, if not by himself, at least\r\nunder his superintendence. Besides all the stupendous labour implied\r\nin these diversified undertakings, Father Hervas has the still further\r\nmerit of having devoted himself to the subject of the instruction of the\r\ndeaf-mute, for whose use he devised a little series of publications, and\r\npublished a very valuable essay on the principles to be followed in their\r\ninstruction.[89]\r\n\r\nOur only present concern, however, is with his philological and\r\nlinguistic publications, especially in so far as they evince a knowledge\r\nof languages. They form part of a great work in twenty-one 4to. volumes,\r\nentitled _Idea dell’ Universo_; and were printed at intervals, at Cesena,\r\nin Italian, from which language they were translated into Spanish by\r\nhis friends and associates, and republished in Spain. It will only be\r\nnecessary to particularize one or two of them—the _Saggio Prattico delle\r\nLingue_, which consists of a collection of the Lord’s Prayer in three\r\nhundred and seven languages, together with other specimens of twenty-two\r\nadditional languages, in which the author was unable to obtain a version\r\nof the Lord’s Prayer, all illustrated by grammatical analyses and\r\nannotations; and the _Catalogo delle Lingue conosciute, e Notizia delle\r\nloro Affinità e Diversità_.[90] In the compilation of these, and his\r\nother collections, it is true, Hervas had the advantage, not alone of\r\nhis own extensive travel, and of his own laborious research, but also of\r\nthe aid of his brethren; and this in an Order which numbered among its\r\nmembers, men to whose adventurous spirit every corner of the world had\r\nbeen familiar:—\r\n\r\n    “In Greenland’s icy mountains,\r\n    On India’s coral strand,\r\n    Where Afric’s sunny fountains\r\n    Roll down their golden sand.”\r\n\r\nBut he, himself, compiled grammars of no less than eighteen of the\r\nlanguages of America; which, with the liberality of true science, he\r\nfreely communicated to William von Humboldt for publication in the\r\n_Mithridates_ of Adelung. He was a most refined classical scholar and a\r\nprofound Orientalist. He was perfectly familiar, besides, with almost\r\nall the European languages; and, wide as is the range of tongues which\r\nhis published works embrace, his critical and grammatical notes and\r\nobservations, even upon the most obscure and least known of the languages\r\nwhich they contain, although in many cases they have of course all the\r\nimperfections of a first essay, exhibit, even in their occasional errors,\r\na vigorous and original mind.\r\n\r\nThe name of Father Hervas-y-Pandura is a fitting close to the\r\ndistinguished line of linguistic “Glorias de España.”\r\n\r\n\r\n§ IV. FRENCH LINGUISTS.\r\n\r\nThe University of Paris did not enter into the study of languages so\r\nearly, or with so much zeal as the rival schools of Spain and Italy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first[91] great name in this department which we meet in the history\r\nof French letters, is that of the celebrated Rabbinical scholar, William\r\nPostel. This extraordinary man was born at Dolerie in 1510. Having lost\r\nboth his parents at a very early age, he was left entirely dependent\r\nupon his own exertions for support; and, with that indomitable energy\r\nwhich often accompanies the love of knowledge, he began, from his very\r\nboyhood, a systematic course of self-denial, by which he hoped to realize\r\nthe means of prosecuting the studies for which he had conceived an early\r\npredilection. Having scraped together, in the laborious and irksome\r\noccupation of a school-master, what he regarded as a sufficient sum for\r\nhis modest wants, he repaired to Paris; but he had scarcely reached\r\nthat city, when he was robbed by some designing sharpers, of the fruits\r\nof all his years of self-denial; and a long illness into which he was\r\nthrown by the chagrin and privation which ensued, reduced him to the\r\nlast extremity. Even still, however, his spirit was unbroken. He went to\r\nBeauce, where, by working as a daily labourer, he earned the means of\r\nreturning to Paris as a poor scholar. Presenting himself at the College\r\nof Saint Barbara, he obtained a place as a servant, with permission to\r\nattend the lectures; and having in some way got possession of a Hebrew\r\ngrammar, he contrived, in his stolen half hours of leisure, to master\r\nthe language so thoroughly, that in a short time his preceptors found\r\nthemselves outstripped by their singular dependent.\r\n\r\nHis reputation as an Oriental scholar spread rapidly. When La Fôret’s\r\nmemorable embassy to the Sultan was being organized by Francis I., the\r\nking was recommended to entrust to Postel a literary mission, somewhat\r\nsimilar to that undertaken during the reign of Louis Philippe, at the\r\ninstance of M. de Villemain, one of the objects of which was to collect\r\nGreek and Oriental MSS. It was on his return from this expedition, (in\r\nwhich he visited Constantinople, Greece, Asia Minor, and part of Syria,)\r\nthat Postel met Teseo Ambrosio at Venice, and published what may be\r\nsaid to have been the first systematic attempt as yet made to bring\r\ntogether materials for the philosophical investigation of the science of\r\nlanguage—being a collection of the alphabets of twelve languages, with a\r\nslight account of each among the number.[92] He was soon after appointed\r\nProfessor of Mathematics, and also of Oriental Languages, in the College\r\nde France; but the wild and visionary character of his mind appears to\r\nhave been quite unsuited to any settled pursuit. He had conceived the\r\nidea that he was divinely called to the mission of uniting all Christians\r\ninto one community, the head of which he recognized in Francis I. of\r\nFrance, whom he maintained to be the lineal descendant of Sem, the eldest\r\nof the sons of Noah. Under the notion that this was his pre-ordained\r\nvocation, he refused to accompany La Fôret on a second mission to the\r\nEast, although he was pressed to do so by the king himself, and a sum\r\nof four thousand crowns was placed at his disposal for the purchase of\r\nmanuscripts. He offered himself, in preference, to the newly founded\r\nsociety of the Jesuits; but his unsuitableness for that state soon became\r\nso apparent, that St. Ignatius of Loyola, then superior of the society,\r\nrefused to receive him. After many wanderings in France, Italy, and\r\nGermany, and an imprisonment in Venice, (where his fanaticism reached its\r\ngreatest height,) he undertook a second expedition to the East, in 1549,\r\nwhence he returned in 1551, with a large number of valuable MSS. obtained\r\nthrough the French ambassador, D’Aramont, but wilder and more visionary\r\nthan ever. He resumed his lectures in the College des Lombards, now the\r\nproperty of the Irish College in Paris. The crowds who flocked to hear\r\nhim were so great, that they were obliged to assemble in the court, where\r\nhe addressed them from one of the windows. His subsequent career was a\r\nstrange alternation of successes and embroilments. The Emperor Ferdinand\r\ninvited him to Vienna, as Professor of Mathematics. While there, he\r\nassisted Widmandstadt in the preparation of his Syriac New Testament.\r\nHe left Vienna, however, after a short residence, and betook himself to\r\nItaly, in 1554 or 1555. He was put into prison in Rome, but liberated in\r\n1557. In 1562 he returned to Paris. The extravagancies of his conduct\r\nand his teaching led to his being placed under a kind of honourable\r\nsurveillance, in 1564, in the monastery of St. Martin des Champs, near\r\nParis. Yet so interesting was his conversation that crowds of the most\r\ndistinguished of all orders continued to visit him in this retreat till\r\nhis death in 1581. Postel’s attainments in languages living or dead, were\r\nundoubtedly most extensive. Not reckoning the modern languages, which\r\nhe may be presumed to have known, his Introduction exhibits a certain\r\nfamiliarity with not less than twelve languages, chiefly eastern; and he\r\nis said to have been able to converse in most of the living languages\r\nknown in his time. Duret states, as a matter notorious to all the\r\nlearned, that he “knew, understood, and spoke fifteen languages;”[93] and\r\nit was his own favourite boast, that he could traverse the entire world\r\nwithout once calling in the aid of an interpreter. In addition to his\r\nlabours as a linguist, Postel was a most prolific writer. Fifty-seven of\r\nhis works are enumerated by his biographer.\r\n\r\nIt is to this learned but eccentric scholar that we owe the idea\r\nof the well-known polyglot collections of the Lord’s Prayer. These\r\ncompilations as carried out by later collectors, have rendered such\r\nservice to philology, that, although many of their authors were little\r\nmore than mere compilers, and have but slender claims to be considered\r\nas linguists, in the higher sense of the word, it would be unpardonable\r\nto pass them over without notice in a Memoir like the present. Towards\r\nthe close of the fourteenth century, a Hungarian soldier named John\r\nSchildberger, while serving in a campaign against the Turks in Hungary,\r\nwas made prisoner by the enemy; and on his return home, after a captivity\r\nof thirty-two years, published (in 1428) an account of his adventures. He\r\nappended to his travels, as a specimen of the languages of the countries\r\nin which he had sojourned, the Lord’s Prayer in Armenian, and also in\r\nthe Tartar tongue. This, however, was a mere traveller’s curiosity:\r\nbut Postel’s publication (Paris, 1558) is more scientific. It contains\r\nspecimens of the characters of twelve different languages, in five of\r\nwhich—Chaldee, Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, and Armenian, the Pater Noster is\r\nprinted both in Roman characters and in those of the several languages.\r\nThis infant essay of Postel was followed, ten years after, by the\r\ncollection of Theodore Bibliander, (the classicized form of the German\r\nname _Buchmann_,) which contains fourteen different Pater Nosters. Conrad\r\nGesner, in 1555, increased the number to twenty-two, to which Angelo\r\nRocea, an Augustinian Bishop, added three more (one of them Chinese) in\r\n1591. Jerome Megiser, in 1592, extended the catalogue to forty. John\r\nBaptist Gramaye, a professor in Louvain, made a still more considerable\r\nstride in advance. He was taken prisoner by the Algerine corsairs, in the\r\nbeginning of the next century, and after his return to Europe, collected\r\nno fewer than a hundred different versions of the Pater Noster, which he\r\npublished in 1622. But his work seems to have attracted little notice;\r\nfor more than forty years later, (1668) a collection made by Bishop\r\nWilkins, the learned linguist, to whom I shall hereafter return, contains\r\nno more than fifty.\r\n\r\nIn all these, however, the only object appears to have been to collect\r\nas large a number of languages as possible, without any attention to\r\ncritical arrangement. But, in the latter part of the same century,\r\nthe collection of Andrew Müller (which comprises eighty-three Pater\r\nNosters) exhibits a considerable advance in this particular. Men began,\r\ntoo, to arrange and classify the various families. Francis Junius\r\n(Van der Yonghe) published the Lord’s Prayer in nineteen different\r\nlanguages of the German family; and Nicholas Witsen devoted himself to\r\nthe languages of Northern Asia—the great Siberian family,—in eleven\r\nof which he published the Lord’s Prayer in 1692. This improvement in\r\nscientific arrangement, however, was not universal; for although the\r\ngreat collection of John Chamberlayne and David Wilkins, printed at\r\nAmsterdam in 1715, contains the Lord’s Prayer in a hundred and fifty-two\r\nlanguages, and that of Christian Frederic Gesner—the well-known\r\n_Orientalischer und Occidentalischer Sprachmeister_ (Leipzic 1748)—in\r\ntwo hundred, they are both equally compiled upon the old plan, and have\r\nlittle value except as mere specimens of the various languages which they\r\ncontain.[94]\r\n\r\nIt is not so with a collection already described, which was published\r\nnear the close of the same century, by a learned Spanish Jesuit,\r\nDon Lorenzo Hervas y Pandura. It is but one of that vast variety of\r\nphilological works from the same prolific pen which, as I have stated,\r\nappeared, year after year, in Cesena, originally in Italian, though they\r\nwere all afterwards published in a Spanish translation, in the author’s\r\nnative country. Father Hervas’s collection, it will be remembered,\r\ncontains the Lord’s Prayer in no less than _three hundred and seven_\r\nlanguages, besides hymns and other prayers in twenty-two additional\r\ndialects, in which the author was not able to find the Pater Noster.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the very same time with this important publication of Hervas,\r\na more extensive philological work made its appearance in the extreme\r\nnorth, under the patronage and indeed the direct inspiration, of the\r\nEmpress Catherine II. of Russia. The plan of this compilation was more\r\ncomprehensive than that of the collections of the Lord’s Prayer. It\r\nconsisted of a Vocabulary of two hundred and seventy-three familiar and\r\nordinary words, in part selected by the Empress herself, and drawn up\r\nin her own hand. This Vocabulary, which is very judiciously chosen, is\r\ntranslated into two hundred and one languages. The compilation of this\r\nvast comparative catalogue of words was entrusted to the celebrated\r\nphilologer, Pallas, assisted by all the eminent scholars of the northern\r\ncapital; among whom the most efficient seems to have been Bakmeister, the\r\nLibrarian of the Imperial Academy of St. Petersburg. The opportunities\r\nafforded by the patronage of a sovereign who held at her disposition the\r\nservices of the functionaries of a vast, and, in the literal sense of\r\nthe word, a polyglot empire like Russia, were turned to the best account.\r\nLanguages entirely beyond the reach of private research, were unlocked\r\nat her command; and the rude and hitherto almost unnamed dialects of\r\nSiberia, of Northern Asia, of the Halieutian islanders, and the nomadic\r\ntribes of the Arctic shores, find a place in this monster vocabulary,\r\nbeside the more polished tongues of Europe and the East. Nevertheless,\r\nthe Vocabulary of Pallas (probably from the circumstance of its being\r\nprinted altogether in the Russian character)[95] is but little familiar\r\nto our philologers, and is chiefly known from the valuable materials\r\nwhich it supplied to Adelung and his colleagues in the compilation of the\r\nwell-known _Mithridates_.\r\n\r\nThe _Mithridates_ of Adelung closes this long series of philological\r\ncollections; but although in its general plan, it is only an expansion\r\nof the original idea of the first simple traveller who presented to his\r\ncountrymen, as specimens of the languages of the countries which he had\r\nvisited, versions in each language of the Prayer which is most familiar\r\nto every Christian, yet it is not only far more extensive in its range\r\nthan any of its predecessors, but also infinitely more philosophical\r\nin its method. There can be no doubt that the selection of a prayer so\r\nidiomatical, and so constrained in its form as the Lord’s Prayer, was far\r\nfrom judicious. As a specimen of the structure of the various languages,\r\nthe choice of it was singularly infelicitous; and the utter disregard of\r\nthe principles of criticism (and in truth of everything beyond the mere\r\nmultiplication of specimens), which marks all the early collections, is\r\nan additional aggravation of its original defect. But it is not so in the\r\n_Mithridates_ of Adelung. It retains the Lord’s Prayer, it is true, like\r\nthe rest, as the specimen (although not the only one) of each language;\r\nbut it abandons the unscientific arrangement of the older collections,\r\nthe languages being distributed into groups according to their\r\nethnographical affinities. The versions, too, are much more carefully\r\nmade; they are accompanied by notes and critical illustrations; and in\r\ngeneral, each language or dialect, with the literature bearing upon it,\r\nis minutely and elaborately described. In a word, the _Mithridates_,\r\nalthough, as might be expected, still falling far short of perfection, is\r\na strictly philosophical contribution to the study of ethnography; and\r\nhas formed the basis, as well as the text, of the researches of all the\r\nmasters in the modern schools of comparative philology.[96]\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to the personal history of linguists, from which we\r\nhave been called aside by the mention of the work of Postel.\r\n\r\nA celebrity as a linguist equally distinguished, and even more unamiable,\r\nthan Postel’s, is that of his countryman and contemporary, the younger of\r\nthe two Scaligers.\r\n\r\nJoseph Justus Scaliger was born at Agen in 1544, and made his school\r\nstudies at Bordeaux, where he was only remarkable for his exceeding\r\ndulness, having spent three years in a fruitless, though painfully\r\nlaborious, attempt to master the first rudiments of the Latin language.\r\nThese clouds of the morning, however, were but the prelude of a brilliant\r\nday. His after successes were proportionately rapid and complete. The\r\nstories which are told of him seem almost legendary. He is said to have\r\nread the entire Iliad and Odyssey in twenty-one days, and to have run\r\nthrough the Greek dramatists and lyric poets in four months. He was but\r\nseventeen years old when he produced his Œdipus. At the same age he was\r\nable to speak Hebrew with all the fluency of a Rabbi. His application\r\nto study was unremitting, and his powers of endurance are described as\r\nbeyond all example. He himself tells, that even in the darkness of the\r\nnight, when he awoke from his brief slumbers, he was able to read without\r\nlighting his lamp![97] So powerful, according to his own account, was\r\nhis eye-sight, that like the knight of Deloraine:—\r\n\r\n    “Alike to him was tide and time,\r\n    Moonless midnight, and matin prime!”\r\n\r\nAfter a brilliant career at Paris, he was invited to occupy the chair\r\nof Belles Lettres at Leyden, where the best part of his life was spent.\r\nLike most eminent linguists, Scaliger possessed the faculty of memory in\r\nan extraordinary degree. He could repeat eighty couplets of poetry after\r\na single reading: he knew by heart every line of his own compositions,\r\nand it was said of him that he never forgot anything which he had learnt\r\nonce. But with all his gifts and all his accomplishments, he contrived\r\nto render himself an object of general dislike, or at least of general\r\ndis-esteem. His vanity was insufferable; and it was of that peculiarly\r\noffensive kind which is only gratified at the expense of the depreciation\r\nof others. His life was a series of literary quarrels; and in the whole\r\nannals of literary polemics, there are none with which, for acrimony,\r\nvirulence, and ferocity of vituperation, these quarrels may not compete.\r\nAnd hence, although there is hardly a subject, literary, antiquarian,\r\nphilological, or critical, on which he has not written, and (for his\r\nage) written well, there are few, nevertheless, who have exercised less\r\ninfluence upon contemporary opinion. Scaliger spoke thirteen languages,\r\nin the study of which Baillet[98] says he never used either a dictionary\r\nor a grammar. He himself declares the same. The languages ascribed to him\r\nare strangely jumbled together in the following lines of Du Bartas:—\r\n\r\n    —————“Scaliger, merveille de notre age,\r\n    Soleil des savants, qui parle elegamment\r\n    Hebreu, Greçois, Romain, Espagnol, Allemand,\r\n    François, Italien, Nubien, Arabique,\r\n    Syriaque, Persian, Anglois, Chaldaique.”[99]\r\n\r\nIn his case it is difficult, as in most others, to ascertain the degree\r\nof his familiarity with each of these. To Du Bartas’s poetical epithet,\r\n_elegamment_, of course, no importance is to be attached; and it would\r\nperhaps be equally unsafe to rely on the depreciatory representations\r\nof his literary antagonists. One thing, at least, is certain, that he\r\nhimself made the most of his accomplishment. He was not the man to hide\r\nhis light from any overweening delicacy. He was one of the greatest\r\nboasters of his own or any other time. In one place he boasts that there\r\nis no language in which he could write with such elegance as Arabic.[100]\r\nIn another he professes to write Syriac as well as the Syrians\r\nthemselves.[101] And it is curiously significant of the reputation which\r\nhe commonly enjoyed, that the wits of his own day used to say that there\r\nwas one particular department of each language in which there could be no\r\ndoubt of his powers—its Billingsgate vocabulary! There was not one, they\r\nconfessed, of the thirteen languages to which he laid claim, in which he\r\nwas not fully qualified to scold![102]\r\n\r\nThe eminent botanist, Charles Le Cluse, (Clusius), a contemporary of\r\nScaliger, can hardly be called a great linguist, as his studies were\r\nchiefly confined to the modern European languages, with several of which\r\nhe was thoroughly conversant; but he is remarkable as having contributed,\r\nby a familiarity with modern languages very rare among the naturalists of\r\nhis day, to settle the comparative popular nomenclature of his science.\r\nHe is even still a high authority on this curious branch of botanical\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nThe reader who remembers the extraordinary reputation enjoyed among his\r\ncontemporaries by the learned Nicholas Peiresc, may be disappointed at\r\nfinding him overlooked in this enumeration: but, as of his extraordinary\r\nerudition he has left no permanent fruit in literature, so of his\r\nacquirements as a linguist no authentic record has been preserved. The\r\nsame is true of his friend, Galaup de Chasteuil, a less showy, perhaps,\r\nbut better read orientalist. Through devotion to these studies, quite\r\nas much as under the influence of religious feeling, Chasteuil made a\r\npilgrimage to the Holy Land, and, in 1631, permanently fixed his abode\r\nin Palestine; and so thoroughly conversant did he become, not only with\r\nthe language and literature, but also with the manners, usages and\r\nfeelings of the Maronites of the Lebanon, that, on the death of their\r\npatriarch, despite the national predilections by which all Easterns are\r\ncharacterized, they desired to elect him, a Western as he was, head of\r\ntheir national church.[103] Lewis de Dieu, the two Morins—Stephen, the\r\nCalvinist minister, and John, the learned Oratorian convert—the two\r\nCappels, Lewis and James, and even the celebrated D’Herbelot, author of\r\nthe _Bibliothèque Orientale_, all belong rather to the class of oriental\r\nscholars than of linguists in the popular acceptation of the word. The\r\ntwo Cappels, as well as their adversaries, the Buxtorfs, are best known\r\nin connexion with the controversy about the Masoretic Points.\r\n\r\nOne of the writers named in a previous page, Claude Duret, although\r\nAdelung[104] could not discover any particulars regarding him, beyond\r\nthose which are detailed in the title of his book, (where he is merely\r\ndescribed as “Bourbonnais, President a Moulins,”) nevertheless deserves\r\nvery special mention on account of the extensive and curious learning,\r\nnot alone in languages, but also in general literature, history and\r\nscience, which characterize his rare work, _Thresor de l’Histoire des\r\nLangues de cet Univers_.[105] This work is undoubtedly far from being\r\nexempt from grave inaccuracies; but it is nevertheless, for its age,\r\na marvel, as well of curious learning and extensive research, as of\r\nacquaintance with a great many (according to one account, seventeen,)\r\nlanguages, both of the East and of the West.[106] How much of this,\r\nhowever, is mere book-scholarship, and how much is real familiarity, it\r\nis impossible, in the absence of all details of the writer’s personal\r\nhistory, to decide.\r\n\r\nAlthough far from being so universal a linguist as Duret, the great\r\nbiblical scholar, Samuel Bochart (born at Rouen in 1599) was much\r\nsuperior to him in his knowledge of Hebrew and the cognate languages,\r\nChaldee, Syriac, Arabic, and even Coptic. His _Hierozoicon_ and\r\n_Geographia Sacra_, as monuments of philological as well as antiquarian\r\nknowledge, have maintained a high reputation even to the present time,\r\nnotwithstanding the advantages enjoyed by modern students of biblical\r\nantiquities and history.[107]\r\n\r\nBochart’s pupil and his friend in early life, (although they were\r\nbitterly alienated from each other at a later period, and although\r\nBochart’s death is painfully associated with their literary quarrel[108])\r\nthe celebrated Peter Daniel Huet, can hardly deserve a place in the\r\ncatalogue of French linguists; but he was at least a liberal and\r\nenlightened patron of the study.\r\n\r\nMany of the French missionaries of the seventeenth century would deserve\r\na place in this series, and among them especially Francis Picquet, who,\r\nafter serving for several years as French consul at Aleppo, embraced a\r\nmissionary life, and at last was consecrated Archbishop of Bagdad in\r\n1674. Le Jay, the projector and editor of the well-known polyglot Bible\r\nwhich appeared in France a few years before the rival publication of\r\nBrian Walton, though he is often spoken of as the mere patron of the\r\nundertaking, was in reality a very profound and accomplished Orientalist.\r\nThe same may be said of Rapheleng, the son-in-law of Plantin, and often\r\ndescribed as his mere assistant in the publication of the King of\r\nSpain’s Polyglot Bible. Matthew Veysiere de la Croze, too, the apostate\r\nBenedictine, although a superficial scholar and a hasty and inaccurate\r\nhistorian, was a very able linguist.\r\n\r\nBut, as we descend lower in the history of this generation of French\r\nlinguists, we find comparatively few names which, for variety of\r\nattainments, can be compared with those of Italy or Germany. Beyond the\r\ncultivation of the Biblical languages, little was done in France for this\r\ndepartment of study during the rest of the seventeenth century. There\r\nseems but too much reason to believe that the reputation of the learned\r\nbut pedantic Menage as a linguist, is extravagantly exaggerated. He was\r\nan accomplished classicist, and his acquaintance with modern languages\r\nwas tolerably extensive. He was a good etymologist, too, according\r\nto the servile and unscientific system of the age. But his claims to\r\nOriental scholarship appear very questionable. And in truth during this\r\nentire period, if it were not for the interest of the controversy above\r\nreferred to, on the antiquity and authority of the Masoretic Points,\r\nit might almost be said that Oriental studies had fallen entirely into\r\ndisuse in France. Even of those who took a part in that discussion, the\r\nname of Masclef (who knew Greek, Hebrew, Syriac, Chaldee, and Arabic,\r\nwith perhaps some of the modern languages) is the only one which can\r\napproach the rank of the higher masters of the study. The three Buxtorfs\r\n(father, son, and grandson), Guarin, and even Girandeau, were mere\r\nHebraists; patient and accurate scholars, it is true, but with few of the\r\ncharacteristics of an eminent linguist. La Bletterie can hardly claim\r\neven this qualified reputation.\r\n\r\nThere is one brilliant exception—the eminent historian and\r\ncontroversialist, Eusebius Renaudot. He was born at Paris in 1646. Having\r\nmade his classical studies under the Jesuits, and those of Philosophy in\r\nthe College d’Harcourt, he entered the congregation of the Oratory. But\r\nhe very soon quitted that society; and, although he continued to wear the\r\necclesiastical dress, he never took holy orders. His life, however, was\r\na model of piety and of every Christian virtue; and it was his peculiar\r\nmerit that, while many of his closest friends and most intimate literary\r\nallies were members of the Jansenist party, Renaudot was inflexible\r\nin his devotion to the judgment of the Holy See. His first linguistic\r\nstudies lay among the Oriental languages, the rich fruit of which we\r\nstill possess in his invaluable Collection of Oriental Liturgies, and in\r\nthe last two volumes of the _Perpetuitè de la Foi sur l’Eucharistie_,\r\nwhich are also from his prolific pen. But he soon extended his researches\r\ninto other fields; and he is said to have been master of seventeen\r\nlanguages,[109] the major part of which he spoke with ease and fluency.\r\n\r\nBut Renaudot stands almost alone.[110] The only names which may claim to\r\nbe placed in comparison with his, are those of the two Petis, François\r\nPetis, and François Petis de la Croix. The latter especially, who\r\nsucceeded his father as royal Oriental interpreter, under Lewis XIV., and\r\nmade several expeditions to the East in this capacity, was well versed,\r\nnot only in Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Tartar, but also in Coptic and\r\nArmenian. His translation of the Arabian Nights Entertainments is the\r\nwork by which he is best known; but his dissertations and collections on\r\nOriental history are full of valuable learning. The eighteenth century\r\nin France was a period of greater activity. Etienne Fourmont, although\r\nborn in 1683, belongs properly to the eighteenth century. He is often\r\ncited as an example of extraordinary powers of memory, having, when a\r\nmere boy, learnt by rote the whole list of Greek Roots in the Port Royal\r\nTreatise, so as to repeat them in every conceivable order. He soon after\r\npublished in French verse all the roots of the Latin language. But it is\r\nas an Orientalist that he is chiefly remarkable. He was appointed to the\r\nchair of Arabic in the College Royal, and also to the office of Oriental\r\ninterpreter in the Bibliothèque du Roi; and soon established such a\r\nreputation as an Orientalist, that he was consulted on philological\r\nquestions by the learned of every country in Europe. He was thoroughly\r\nmaster of Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, and Persian, and was one of the\r\nfirst French scholars who, without having visited China,[111] attained to\r\nany notable proficiency in Chinese.\r\n\r\nHis nephew, Michael Angelo Deshauterayes, born at Conflans Ste. Honorine,\r\nnear Pontoise, 1724, was even more precocious. At the age of ten, he\r\ncommenced his studies under Fourmont’s superintendence. He thus became\r\nfamiliar at an early age with Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, and Chinese; so\r\nthat in his twenty-second year he was appointed to succeed his uncle as\r\nOriental Interpreter to the Royal Library, to which post, a few years\r\nlater, was added the Arabic professorship in the College de France. In\r\nthese employments he devoted himself to Oriental studies for above thirty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAnother pupil of Fourmont, Joseph de Guignes, born at Pontoise in 1721,\r\nattained equal eminence as an Orientalist. At Fourmont’s death, he\r\nwas associated with the last named linguist on the staff of the Royal\r\nLibrary. But De Guignes’ merit in the department of Oriental history and\r\nantiquities, has almost overshadowed his reputation as a mere linguist,\r\nalthough he was a proficient in all the principal Eastern languages, and\r\nin many of those of Europe. His History of the Huns, Turks, Moguls, and\r\nother Tartar nations, notwithstanding that many of its views are now\r\ndiscarded, is still regarded as a repertory of Oriental learning; and,\r\nwhile both in this and also in some others of his works, De Guignes is\r\noften visionary and even paradoxical,[112] he is acknowledged to have\r\ndone more for Chinese literature in France, than any linguist before Abel\r\nRemusat; nor is there one of the scholars of the eighteenth century, who\r\nin the spirit, if not in the letter, of the views which he put forward,\r\ncomes so near to the more enlarged and more judicious theories of the\r\nscholars of our own day, on the general questions of philology.\r\n\r\nFrom the days of De Guignes the higher departments of linguistic science\r\nfell for a time into disrepute in France; but a powerful impulse\r\nwas given to the practical cultivation of Oriental languages by the\r\ndiplomatic relations of that kingdom with Constantinople and the Levant.\r\nThe official appointments connected with that service served to supply\r\nat once a stimulus to the study and an opportunity for its practice.\r\nCardonne, Ruffin,[113] Legrand, Kieffer, Venture de Paradis, and Langlés,\r\nwere all either trained in that school, or devoted themselves to the\r\nstudy as a preparation for it.\r\n\r\nOf these, perhaps John Michael Venture De Paradis is the most remarkable.\r\nHis father had been French Consul in the Crimea, and in various cities\r\nof the Levant, and appears to have educated the boy with a special\r\nview to the Oriental diplomatic service. From the College de Louis le\r\nGrand, he was transferred, at the age of fifteen, to Constantinople,\r\nand, before he had completed his twenty-second year, he was appointed\r\ninterpreter of the French embassy in Syria. Thence he passed into\r\nEgypt in the same capacity, and, in 1777, accompanied Baron de Tott in\r\nhis tour of inspection of the French establishments in the Levant. He\r\nwas sent afterwards to Tunis, to Constantinople, and to Algiers; and\r\neventually was attached to the ministry of Foreign Affairs in Paris, with\r\nthe Professorship of Oriental Languages. His last service was in the\r\nmemorable Egyptian expedition under Bonaparte, in which he fell a victim\r\nto fatigue, and the evil effects of the climate, in 1799.[114]\r\n\r\nLewis Matthew Langlés[115] was a Picard, born at Peronne, in 1763. From\r\nhis boyhood he too was destined for the diplomatic service; and studied\r\nfirst at Montdidier, and afterwards in Paris, where he obtained an\r\nemployment which afforded him considerable leisure for the pursuit of\r\nhis favourite studies. He learned Arabic under Caussin de Perceval, and\r\nPersian under Ruffin. Soon afterwards, however, he engaged in the study\r\nof Mantchu, and in some time became such a proficient in that language,\r\nthat he was entrusted with the task of editing the Mantchu Dictionary\r\nof Pere Amiot. From that time his reputation was established, at least\r\nwith the general public. His subsequent publications in every department\r\nof languages are numerous beyond all precedent. He had the reputation\r\nof knowing, besides the learned languages, Chinese, Tartar, Japanese,\r\nSanscrit, Malay, Armenian, Arabic, Turkish, and Persian. But it must be\r\nadded that the solidity of these attainments has been gravely impeached,\r\nand that by many he is regarded more as a charlatan than as a scholar.\r\n\r\nNo such cloud hangs over the fame of, after De Guignes, the true reviver\r\nof Chinese literature, Abel Remusat.[116] He was born at Paris in 1788,\r\nand brought up to the medical profession; and it may almost be said that\r\nthe only time devoted by him to his early linguistic studies was stolen\r\nfrom the laborious preparation for the less congenial career to which\r\nhe was destined by his father. By a very unusual preference, he applied\r\nhimself, almost from the first, to the Chinese and Tartar languages. Too\r\npoor to afford the expensive luxury of a Chinese dictionary, he compiled,\r\nwith incredible labour, a vocabulary for his own use; and the interest\r\ncreated at once by the success of his studies, and by the unexampled\r\ndevotedness with which they were pursued, were so great as to procure\r\nfor him, at the unanimous instance of the Academy of Inscriptions, the\r\nfavour, at that period rare and difficult, of exemption from the chances\r\nof military conscription. From that time forward he applied himself\r\nunremittingly to philological pursuits; and, although he was admitted\r\ndoctor of the faculty of medicine, at Paris in 1813, he never appears to\r\nhave practised actively in the profession. On the creation of the two\r\nnew chairs of Chinese and Sanscrit, in the College de France, after the\r\nRestoration, Remusat was appointed to the former, in November, 1814;\r\nfrom which period he gave himself up entirely to literature. He was\r\nspeedily admitted into all the learned societies both of Paris and of\r\nother countries; and in 1818 he became one of the editors of the _Journal\r\ndes Savans_. On the establishment (in which he had a chief part,) of the\r\nSociété Asiatique, in 1822, he was named its perpetual secretary; and,\r\non the death of Langlés, in 1824, he succeeded to the charge of keeper\r\nof Oriental MSS. in the Bibliothèque du Roi. This office he continued to\r\nhold till his early and universally lamented death in 1832. Remusat’s\r\neminence lay more in the depth and accuracy of his scholarship in\r\nthe one great branch of Oriental languages, which he selected as his\r\nown—those of Eastern Asia—and in the profoundly philosophical spirit\r\nwhich he brought to the investigation of the relations of these languages\r\nto each other, and to the other great families of the earth, than in the\r\nnumerical extent of his acquaintance with particular languages. But this,\r\ntoo, was such as to place him in the very first rank of linguists.\r\n\r\nA few words must suffice for the French school since Remusat, although it\r\nhas held a very distinguished place in philological science. The Société\r\nAsiatique, founded at Remusat’s instance, and for many years directed\r\nby him as secretary, has not only produced many eminent individual\r\nphilologers, as De Sacy, Quatremere, Champollion, Renan, Fresnel, and\r\nDe Merian; but, what is far more important, it has successfully carried\r\nout a systematic scheme of investigation, by which alone it is possible,\r\nin so vast a subject, to arrive at satisfactory results. M. Stanislas\r\nJulien’s researches in Chinese; M. Dulaurier’s in the Malay languages;\r\nFather Marcoux’s in the American Indian; Eugene Bournouf’s in those of\r\nPersia; the brothers Antoine and Arnauld d’Abbadie in the languages of\r\nEast Africa, and especially in the hitherto almost unknown Abyssinian\r\nand Ethiopian families; Eugene Borè in Armenian;[117] M. Fresnel’s\r\nexplorations among the tribes of the western shores of the Red Sea; and\r\nmany similar successful investigations of particular departments, are\r\ncontributing to lay up such a body of facts, as cannot fail to afford\r\nsure and reliable data for the scientific solution by the philologers\r\nof the coming generation, of those great problems in the science of\r\nlanguage, on which their fathers could only speculate as a theory, and\r\nat the best could but address themselves in conjecture. Although I have\r\nno intention of entering into the subject of living French linguists,\r\nyet there is one of the gentlemen whom I have mentioned, M. Fulgence\r\nFresnel, whom I cannot refrain from alluding to before I pass from\r\nthe subject of French philology. His name is probably familiar to the\r\npublic at large, in connexion with the explorations of the French at\r\nNineveh; but he is long known to the readers of the Journal Asiatique\r\nas a linguist not unworthy of the very highest rank in that branch of\r\nscholarship. M. d’Abbadie,[118] himself a most accomplished linguist,\r\ninformed me that M. Fresnel, although exceedingly modest on the subject\r\nof his attainments, has the reputation of knowing twenty languages. The\r\nfacility with which he has acquired some of these languages almost rivals\r\nthe fame of Mezzofanti. M. Arago having suggested on one occasion the\r\ndesirableness of a French translation of Berzelius’s Swedish Treatise\r\n“On the Blow-pipe,” Fresnel at once set about learning Swedish, and in\r\nthree months had completed the desired translation! He reads fluently\r\nHebrew, Greek, Romaic, Latin, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, and\r\nwhat little is known of the Hieroglyphical language. He is second only\r\nto Lane as an Arabic scholar. Among the less known languages of which M.\r\nFresnel is master, M. d’Abbadie heard him speak a few sentences of one,\r\nof which he may be said to have himself been the discoverer, and which\r\nis, in some respects, completely anomalous. M. Fresnel describes this\r\ncurious language in the Journal Asiatique, July, 1838. It is spoken by\r\nthe savages of Mahrak; and as it is not reducible to any of the three\r\nfamilies, the Aramaic, the Canaanitic, or the Arabic, of which, according\r\nto Gesenius, the Ethiopic is an elder branch, M. Fresnel believes it to\r\nbe the very language spoken by the Queen of Saba! Its present seat is in\r\nthe mountainous district of Hhacik, Mirbât, and Zhafâr. Its most singular\r\ncharacteristic consists in its articulations, which are exceedingly\r\ndifficult and most peculiar. Besides all the nasal sounds of the French\r\nand Portuguese, and that described as the “sputtered sound” of the\r\nAmharic, this strange tongue has three articulations, which can only be\r\nenunciated with _the right side of the mouth_; and the act of uttering\r\nthem produces a contortion which destroys the symmetry of the features!\r\nM. Fresnel describes it as “horrible, both to hear and to see spoken.”\r\nEndeavouring to represent the force of one of these sounds by the letters\r\n_hh_, he calls the language _Ehhkili_.[119]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ V. LINGUISTS OF THE TEUTONIC RACE.[120]\r\n\r\nIf we abstract from the Sacred Languages, the German scholars were slow\r\nin turning themselves to Oriental studies.\r\n\r\nJohn Müller, of Königsberg, commonly known as Regiomontanus, although he\r\nhad the highest repute for learning of all the German scholars of the\r\nfifteenth century, does not appear to have gone beyond the classical\r\nlanguages. Martin Luther, Reuchlin,[121] Ulrich Van Hutten, Hoogenstraet,\r\nwere Hebraists and no more; and John Widmanstadt, when he wished to study\r\nArabic, was forced to make a voyage to Spain expressly for the purpose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first student of German race at all distinguished by scholarship in\r\nlanguages, was Theodore Bibliander,[122] who, besides Greek and Hebrew,\r\nwas also well versed in Arabic, and probably in many other Oriental\r\ntongues.[123] The celebrated naturalist, Conrad Gesner, though perhaps\r\nnot so solidly versed as Bibliander, in any one language, appears to have\r\npossessed a certain acquaintance with a greater number. His _Mithridates;\r\nde Differentiis Linguarum_,[124] resembles in plan as well as in name,\r\nthe great work of Adelung. The number and variety of the languages which\r\nit comprises is extraordinary for the period. It contains the Pater\r\nNoster in twenty-two of these; and, although the observations on many of\r\nthe specimens are exceedingly brief and unsatisfactory, yet they often\r\nexhibit much curious learning, and no mean familiarity with the language\r\nto which they belong.[125] Gesner’s success as a linguist is the more\r\nremarkable, inasmuch as that study by no means formed his principal\r\npursuit. Botany and Natural History might much better be called the real\r\nbusiness of his literary life. Accordingly, Beza says of him, that he\r\nunited in his person the very opposite genius of Varro and Pliny; and,\r\nalthough he died at the comparatively early age of forty-nine, his works\r\non Natural History fill nearly a dozen folio volumes. Both Gesner and\r\nBibliander fell victims, one in 1564, the other in 1565, to the great\r\nplague of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nJerome Megiser, who, towards the close of the same century compiled the\r\nmore extensive polyglot collection of Pater Nosters already referred to,\r\nneed scarcely be noticed. He is described by Adelung,[126] as a man of\r\nvarious, but trivial and superficial learning.\r\n\r\nNot so another German scholar of the same age, Jacob Christmann, of\r\nMaintz. Christmann was no less distinguished as a philosopher than as a\r\nlinguist. He held for many years at Heidelberg the seemingly incompatible\r\nprofessorships of Hebrew, Arabic, and Logic, and is described as\r\ndeeply versed in all the ancient and modern languages, as well as in\r\nmathematical and astronomical science.[127]\r\n\r\nIt would be unjust to overlook the scholars of the Low Countries during\r\nthe same period. Some of these, as for example, Drusius, and the three\r\nSchultens, father, son, and grandson, were chiefly remarkable as\r\nHebraists. But there are many others, both of the Belgian and the Dutch\r\nschools, whose scholarship was of a very high order. Among the former,\r\nAndrew Maes (Masius,) deserves a very special notice. He was born in\r\n1536, at Linnich in the diocese of Courtrai. In 1553 he was sent to\r\nRome as chargé d’affaires. During his residence there, in addition to\r\nGreek, Latin, Spanish, and other European languages, with which he was\r\nalready familiar, he made himself master, not only of Italian, but also\r\nof Hebrew, Chaldee, and Syriac. He is said[128] to have assisted Arias\r\nMontanus in the compilation of his Polyglot Bible; but of this no mention\r\nis made by Montanus in the preface. No doubt, however, can be entertained\r\nof his great capacity as an Orientalist; and Sebastian Munster used to\r\nsay of him that he seemed to have been brought up among the Hebrews, and\r\nto have lived in the classic days of the Roman Empire. About the same\r\nperiod, or a few years later, David Haecx published his dictionary of the\r\nMalay languages, one of the earliest contributions to the study of that\r\ncurious family. Haecx, though he spent his life in Rome, was a native of\r\nAntwerp.\r\n\r\nJohn Baptist Gramaye, already named as a collector of Pater Nosters,\r\nacquired some reputation as one of the first contributors to the history\r\nof the languages of Africa, although his work is described by Adelung as\r\nvery inaccurate. Gramaye was a native of Antwerp, and became provost of\r\nArnheim and historiographer of the Low Countries. On a voyage from Italy\r\nto Spain, he fell into the hands of Algerine corsairs, who carried him to\r\nAlgiers. There he was sold as a slave, and was detained a considerable\r\ntime in Barbary. Having at length obtained his liberty, he published,\r\nafter his return, a diary of his captivity, a descriptive history of\r\nAfrica, and a polyglot collection of Pater Nosters, among which are\r\nseveral African languages not previously known in Europe.[129] Very\r\nlittle, however, is known of his own personal acquirements, which are\r\nnoticeable, perhaps, rather on account of their unusual character, than\r\nof their great extent or variety.\r\n\r\nSome of the linguists of Holland may claim a higher rank. The well-known\r\nArabic scholar, Erpenius, (Thomas Van Erpen,) was also acquainted with\r\nseveral other Oriental languages, Hebrew, Chaldee, Persian, Turkish, and\r\nEthiopic. His countryman and successor in the chair of Oriental languages\r\nat Leyden, James Golius, was hardly less distinguished. Peter Golius,\r\nbrother of James, who entered the Carmelite Order and spent many years\r\nas a missionary in Syria and other parts of the East, became equally\r\ncelebrated in Rome for his Oriental scholarship. In all these three cases\r\nthe knowledge of the languages was not a mere knowledge of books, but had\r\nbeen acquired by actual travel and research in the various countries of\r\nthe East.\r\n\r\nJohn Henry Hottinger, too, a pupil of James Golius at Leyden, and the\r\nlearned Jesuit, Father Athanasius Kircher, belong also to this period.\r\nThe latter, who is well known for his varied and extensive attainments\r\nin every department of science, was moreover a linguist of no ordinary\r\nmerit.[130] He was born at Geyzen, near Fulda, in 1602, and entered the\r\nJesuit society in 1618, when only sixteen years old. No detailed account\r\nis given by his biographers (with whom languages were of minor interest,)\r\nof the exact extent of his attainments in the department of languages;\r\nbut they were both diversified and respectable, and in some things he was\r\nfar beyond the men of his own time. His _Lingua Egyptiaca Restituta_ may\r\nstill be consulted with advantage by the student of Coptic.\r\n\r\nMost of these men, however, confined themselves chiefly to one particular\r\ndepartment. The first really universal linguist of Germany is the great\r\nEthiopic scholar, Job Ludolf, who was born at Erfurt, in 1624. Early in\r\nlife he devoted himself to the study of languages; and his extensive\r\ntravels—first as preceptor to the sons of the Duke of Saxe-Gotha,\r\nand afterwards as tutor to the children of the Swedish ambassador in\r\nParis—coupled with his unexampled industry,[131] enabled him, not only to\r\nhold a high rank in history and general literature, but also to attain to\r\na success as a linguist which had rarely been equalled before his time.\r\nHe is said to have been master of twenty-five languages,[132] but as I\r\nhave never seen any exact enumeration of them, I am inclined to allow for\r\nconsiderable exaggeration.\r\n\r\nThere is even more reason to suspect of exaggeration the popular accounts\r\nwhich have come down to us of a self-educated linguist of the same\r\nperiod—a Saxon peasant called Nicholas Schmid, more commonly known as\r\nCüntzel of Rothenacker, from the name of the village where he was born,\r\nin 1606. This extraordinary man was the son of a peasant. His youth\r\nwas entirely neglected. He worked as a common labourer on his father’s\r\nfarm, and, until his sixteenth year, never had learned even the letters\r\nof the alphabet. At this age one of the farm-servants taught him to\r\nread, greatly to the dissatisfaction of his father, who feared that such\r\nstudies would withdraw him from his work. Soon afterwards, a relative who\r\nwas a notary, gave him a few lessons in Latin; and, under the direction\r\nof the same relative, he learned the rudiments of Greek, Hebrew, and\r\nother languages. During all this time, he continued his daily occupation\r\nas a farm-labourer, and had no time for his studies but what he was able\r\nto steal from the hours allotted for sleep and for meals; the latter of\r\nwhich he snatched in the most hurried manner, and always with an open\r\nbook by his side. In this strange way, amid the toils of the field and\r\nof the farm-yard, Schmid is said to have acquired a store of knowledge\r\nthe details of which border upon the marvelous, one of his recorded\r\nperformances being a translation of the Lord’s Prayer into fifty-one\r\nlanguages![133]\r\n\r\nOne of the scholars engaged in the compilation of Walton’s Polyglot,\r\nAndrew Müller, has left a reputation less marvellous, but more solid.\r\nHe was born about 1630, at Greiffenhagen in Pomerania. Müller, like\r\nCrichton, was a precocious genius. At eighteen he wrote verses freely in\r\nLatin, Greek, and Hebrew. On the completion of his studies, he became\r\npastor of Königsberg on the Warta; but the duties of that charge soon\r\nbecame distasteful to him, and, after a short trial, he resolved, at\r\nthe invitation of Castell, to settle in England, and devote himself to\r\nliterature. He arrived just as Brian Walton was making arrangements for\r\nthe publication of his celebrated Polyglot Bible, and at once entered\r\nearnestly into the scheme. He took up his residence in the house of\r\nJohn Castell in the Strand, where, for ten years, he applied himself\r\nunremittingly to study. It is told of him that, in the ardour of study\r\nor the indifference of scholastic seclusion, he would not raise his\r\nhead from his books to look out of the window, on occasion of Charles\r\nII.’s triumphal progress at the Restoration! Having received from Bishop\r\nWilkins some information on the subject of Chinese, he conceived a\r\nmost enthusiastic passion for that language. He obtained some types at\r\nAntwerp, and, through the instructions of the celebrated Jesuit, Father\r\nKircher, and other members of the society, he was perhaps the first\r\nEuropean scholar who, without actually visiting China, acquired a mastery\r\nof its language; as he is certainly one of the first who deserted the\r\ntrack of the old philologers, and attempted the comparative study of\r\nlanguages on principles approaching to those which modern science has\r\nmade familiar. Soon after the completion of Walton’s Polyglot Müller\r\nreturned to Germany. He was named successively Pastor of Bernau and\r\nProvost of Berlin in 1667, but resigned both livings in 1685, and lived\r\nthenceforth in retirement at Stettin. He died in 1694. Although a most\r\nlaborious man and a voluminous writer, Müller’s views were visionary\r\nand unpractical. He professed to have devised a plan of teaching, so\r\ncomplete, that, by adopting it, a perfect knowledge of Chinese could be\r\nacquired in half a year, and so simple, that it could be applied to the\r\ninstruction of persons of the most ordinary capacity. Haller states that\r\nhe spoke no less than twenty languages.\r\n\r\nA Burgomaster-linguist is a more singular literary phenomenon. We are\r\nso little accustomed to connect that title with any thing above the\r\nplodding details of the commerce with which it is inseparably associated,\r\nthat the name of Nicholas Witzen, Burgomaster of Amsterdam, deserves to\r\nbe specially commemorated, as an exception to an unliterary class. It\r\nwas in the pursuit of his vocation as a merchant that Witzen acquired\r\nthe chief part of the languages with which he was acquainted. He made\r\nrepeated expeditions to Russia between the years 1666 and 1677, in\r\nseveral of which he penetrated far into the interior of the country,\r\nand had opportunities of associating with many of the motley races of\r\nthat vast empire; Slavonians, Tartars, Cossacks, Samoiedes, and the\r\nvarious Siberian tribes; as well as with natives of Eastern kingdoms not\r\nsubject to Russia.[134] Besides inquiries into the geography and natural\r\nhistory of those countries which lie upon the north-eastern frontier of\r\nEurope and the contiguous provinces of Asia, Witzen used every effort\r\nto glean information regarding their languages. He obtained, in most\r\nof these languages, not only versions of the Lord’s Prayer, but also\r\nvocabularies comprising a considerable number of words; both of which\r\nhe supplied to his friend and correspondent, Leibnitz, for publication\r\nin his _Collectanea Etymologica_.[135] How far Witzen himself was\r\nacquainted with these languages it is difficult to determine; but he is\r\nat least entitled to notice as the first collector of materials for this\r\nparticular branch of the study.\r\n\r\nDavid Wilkins, Chamberlayne’s fellow-labourer in the compilation of\r\nthe Collection of Pater Nosters referred to in a former page, may also\r\ndeserve a passing notice. The place of his birth, which occurred about\r\n1685, is a matter of some uncertainty. Adelung[136] thinks he was a\r\nnative of Dantzig; by others he is believed to have been a native of\r\nHolland. The best part of his life, however, was spent in England; where,\r\nat Cambridge, he took the degree of Doctor of Divinity, in 1717. He was\r\nafterwards appointed Librarian of Lambeth and Archdeacon of Suffolk.\r\nHis qualifications as Polyglot editor, at the time when he undertook\r\nto assist Chamberlayne, appear to have consisted rather in patient\r\nindustry and general scholarship, than in any extraordinary familiarity\r\nwith languages; though he afterwards obtained considerable reputation,\r\nespecially by an edition of the New Testament in Coptic, in 1716.\r\n\r\nWith the illustrious name of Leibnitz we commence a new era in the\r\nscience of languages. This extraordinary man, who united in himself all\r\nthe most varied, and it might seem incompatible, excellencies of other\r\nmen—a jurist and a divine, a mathematician and a poet, a historian and\r\na philosopher—added to all his other prodigious attainments a most\r\nextensive and profound knowledge of languages. It is not, however, on the\r\nactual extent of his acquaintance with particular languages (although\r\nthis too was most remarkable), that his fame as a scientific linguist\r\nrests. He was the first to recognize the true nature and objects of\r\nlinguistic science, and to direct its studies to an object at once\r\neminently practical and profoundly philosophical. It is not alone that,\r\ndeserting the trivialities of the old etymologists, he laid down the\r\ntrue principles of the great science of comparative philology, and\r\ndetected its full importance; Leibnitz may claim the further merit of\r\nhaving himself almost created that science, and given it forth, a new\r\nMinerva, in its full and perfect development. There is hardly a principle\r\nof modern philology the germ of which may not be discovered in his\r\nsingularly pregnant and suggestive essays and letters; and, what is far\r\nmore remarkable, he has often, with the instinctive sagacity of original\r\ngenius, anticipated sometimes by conjecture, sometimes by positive\r\nprediction, analogies and results which the investigations of actual\r\nexplorers have since realized.[137]\r\n\r\nOne of the most important practical services rendered by Leibnitz to\r\nscience, was the organization of academies and other scientific bodies,\r\nby which the efforts of individuals might be systematically guided to one\r\ncommon end, and the results of their researches, whether in collecting\r\nfacts or in developing theories, might, through the collision of many\r\nminds, be submitted to the ordeal of careful examination and judicious\r\ndiscussion. It is chiefly to him that science is indebted for the Royal\r\nSociety of Berlin and the Academy of St. Petersburg. Both of these\r\nbodies, although embracing the whole circle of science, have proved most\r\neminent schools of languages; and it is a curious illustration of that\r\nprofound policy, in pursuance of which we see Russia still availing\r\nherself of the service of genius wherever it is to be found, that many\r\nof the ablest German linguists of the eighteenth century were, either\r\ndirectly or indirectly, connected with the latter institution.\r\n\r\nGerard Frederic Müller is an early example. He was born, at Herforden\r\nin Westphalia, in 1705, and was a pupil of the celebrated Otto Mencken.\r\nMencken, having been invited to become a member of the new academy of St.\r\nPetersburg, declined the honour for himself, but recommended his scholar\r\nMüller in his stead.[138] Müller accordingly accompanied the scientific\r\nexpedition which was sent to Siberia under the elder Gmelin, (also a\r\nGerman,) from 1733 to 1741. On his return, he was appointed keeper of\r\nthe Imperial Archives, and Historiographer of Russia. Müller does not\r\nappear to have given much attention to Oriental languages; but he was\r\nmore generally familiar with modern languages than most of the scholars\r\nof that period.[139]\r\n\r\nAugustus Lewis Schlötzer, another German literary adventurer in the\r\nRussian service, and for a time secretary of Müller, was a more generally\r\naccomplished linguist. Unlike Müller, he was a skilful Orientalist;\r\nand he was versed, moreover, in several of the Slavonic languages with\r\nwhich Müller had neglected to make himself acquainted, before engaging\r\nin the compilation of his great collection of Russian Historians. For\r\nthis he availed himself of the assistance of his secretary Schlötzer.\r\nGottlieb Bayer of Königsberg, one of the earliest among the scholars of\r\nGermany, author of the _Museum Sinicum_, also occupied for some years\r\na chair at St. Petersburg; but he is better known by his ferocious\r\ncontroversial writings, than by his philological works. A much more\r\ndistinguished scholar of modern Germany, almost entirely unknown in\r\nEngland, is Christian William Buttner. He was born at Wolfenbüttel in\r\n1716, and was destined by his father (an apothecary) for the medical\r\nprofession; but, although he gave his attention in the first instance to\r\nthe sciences preparatory to that profession, the real pursuit of his life\r\nbecame philology, and especially in its relation to the great science\r\nof ethnography. It was a saying of Cuvier’s, that Linnæus and Buttner\r\nrealised by their united studies the title of Grotius’s celebrated work,\r\n“De Jure _Naturæ_ et _Gentium_;”—Linnæus by his pursuit of _Natural_\r\nHistory assuming the first, and Buttner, by his _ethnological_ studies,\r\nappropriating the second—as the respective spheres of their operations.\r\nIn every country which Buttner visited, he acquired not only the\r\ngeneral language, but the most minute peculiarities of its provincial\r\ndialects. Few literary lives are recorded in history which present such\r\na picture of self-denial and privation voluntarily endured in the cause\r\nof learning, as that of Buttner. His library and museum, accumulated\r\nfrom the hoardings of his paltry income, were exceedingly extensive and\r\nmost valuable. In order to scrape together the means for their gradual\r\npurchase, he contented himself during the greater part of his later\r\nlife with a single meal per day, the cost of which never exceeded a\r\nsilber-groschen, or somewhat less than three half-pence![140] It may be\r\ninferred, however, from what has been said, that Buttner’s attainments\r\nwere mainly those of a book-man. In the scanty notices of him which we\r\nhave gleaned, we do not find that his power of speaking foreign languages\r\nwas at all what might have been expected from the extent and variety\r\nof his book-knowledge. But his services as a scientific philologer\r\nwere infinitely more important, as well as more permanent, than any\r\nsuch ephemeral faculty. He was the first to observe and to cultivate\r\nthe true relations of the monosyllabic languages of southern Asia, and\r\nto place them at the head of his scheme of the Asiatic and European\r\nlanguages. He was the first to conceive, or at least to carry out, the\r\ntheory of the geographical distribution of languages; and he may be\r\nlooked on as the true founder of the science of glossography. He was\r\nthe first to systematise and to trace the origin and affiliations of\r\nthe various alphabetical characters; and his researches in the history\r\nof the palæography of the Semitic family may be said to have exhausted\r\nthe subject. Nevertheless, he has himself written very little; but he\r\ncommunicated freely to others the fruits of his researches; and there\r\nare few of the philologers of his time who have not confessed their\r\nobligations to him. Michaelis, Schlötzer, Gatterer, and almost every\r\nother contemporary German scholar of note, have freely acknowledged both\r\nthe value of his communications and the generous and liberal spirit in\r\nwhich they were imparted.[141]\r\n\r\nJohn David Michaelis[142] (1717-91) is so well known in these countries\r\nby his contributions to Biblical literature[143] that little can be\r\nnecessary beyond the mention of his name. His grammar of the Hebrew,\r\nChaldee, Syriac, and Arabic languages, sufficiently attest his abilities\r\nas an Orientalist; and, as regards that particular family of languages,\r\nhis philological views are generally solid and judicious. But I am\r\nunable to discover what were his attainments in modern languages; and to\r\nthe general science of comparative philology he cannot be said to have\r\nrendered any important original contribution.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Missionaries of Germany, although of course less numerous\r\nthan their brethren of Italy and the Spanish Peninsula, have contributed\r\ntheir share to the common stock of linguistic science. Many of the Jesuit\r\nMissionaries of Central and Southern America;—for example, Fathers\r\nRichter, Fritz, Grebmer, and Widmann—whose papers are the foundation of\r\nHumboldt’s Essay in the _Mithridates_, were of German origin. Father\r\nDobritzhofer, whose interesting account of the Abipones has been\r\ntranslated into English[144], under Southey’s advice and superintendence,\r\nwas a native of Austria; and the learned Sanscrit scholar, Father\r\nPaulinus de Sancto Bartholomeo, (although less known under his German\r\nname, John Philip Werdin) was an Austrian Carmelite, and served for above\r\nfourteen years in the Indian missions of his order.\r\n\r\nA German philanthropist of a different class, Count Leopold von Berchtold\r\n(1738-1809) the Howard of Germany, deserves to be named, not merely for\r\nhis devoted services to the cause of humanity throughout the world, but\r\nfor his remarkable acquirements as a linguist. He spoke fluently eight\r\nEuropean languages;[145] and, what is more rare, wrote and published in\r\nthe greater number of them, tracts upon the great subject to which he\r\ndedicated his life. He died, at a very advanced age, of the plague, and\r\nhas long been honoured as a martyr in the cause of philanthropy; but he\r\nhas left no notable work behind him.\r\n\r\nVery different the career of the great author of the _Mithridates_, John\r\nChristopher Adelung, who lived almost exclusively for learning. He was\r\nborn in 1734, at Spantekow in Pomerania. In 1759, he was appointed to\r\na professorship at Erfurt; but he exchanged it, after a few years, for\r\na place at Leipsic, where he continued to reside for a long series of\r\nyears. Although habitually of a gay and cheerful disposition, and a most\r\nagreeable member of society, he was one of the most assiduous students\r\nupon record, devoting as a rule no less than fourteen hours a day to his\r\nliterary occupations.[146] His services to his native language are still\r\ngratefully acknowledged by every German etymologist, and his Dictionary,\r\n(although since much improved by Voss and Campe,) has been declared as\r\ngreat a boon to Germany, as the united labours of the Academy had been\r\nable to offer to France. Adelung’s personal reputation as a linguist was\r\nexceedingly high, but his fame with posterity must rest on his great\r\nwork, the _Mithridates_, which I have already briefly described. The very\r\norigination of such a work, or at least the undertaking it upon the scale\r\non which he has carried it out, would have made the reputation of an\r\nordinary man. In the touching preface of the first volume, (the only one\r\nwhich Adelung lived to see published,) he describes it as “the youngest\r\nand probably the last child of his muse;” and confesses that “he has\r\nnurtured, dressed, and cherished it, with all the tenderness which it\r\nis commonly the lot of the youngest child to enjoy.”[147] It is indeed\r\na work of extraordinary labour, and, although from the manner in which\r\nits materials were supplied, necessarily incomplete and even inaccurate\r\nin its details, a work of extraordinary ability. The first volume alone\r\n(containing the languages of Asia, and published in 1806,) is exclusively\r\nAdelung’s. Of the second, only a hundred and fifty pages had been printed\r\nwhen the venerable author died in his seventy-third year. These printed\r\nsheets, and the papers which he had collected for the subsequent\r\nvolumes, he bequeathed to Dr. Severinus Vater, professor of theology at\r\nKönigsberg, under whose editorship, with assistance from several friends,\r\n(and especially from the lamented William von Humboldt and Frederic\r\nAdelung,) the second volume, which comprises the languages of Europe with\r\nall their ramifications, appeared in 1809. The third, on the languages\r\nof Africa, and of America, (for which last the work is indebted to\r\nHumboldt,) appeared, in parts, between 1812 and 1816; and a supplementary\r\nvolume, containing additions to the earlier portions of the work, by\r\nHumboldt, Frederic Adelung, and Vater himself, was published in 1817.\r\nIt is impossible to overstate the importance and value of this great\r\nlinguistic repertory. The arrangement of the work is strictly scientific,\r\naccording to the views then current. The geographical distribution, the\r\norigin and history, and the general structural peculiarities of each,\r\nnot only of the great families, but of the individual languages, and in\r\nmany cases even of the local dialects, are carefully, though briefly\r\ndescribed. The specimen Pater Noster in each language and dialect, is\r\ncritically examined, and its vocabulary explained. To each language,\r\ntoo, is prefixed a catalogue of the chief philological or etymological\r\nworks which treat of its peculiarities; and thus abundant suggestions\r\nare supplied for the prosecution of more minute researches into its\r\nnature and history. And for the most part, all this is executed with so\r\nmuch simplicity and clearness, with so true a perception of the real\r\npoints of difficulty in each language, and with so almost instinctive\r\na power of discriminating between those peculiarities in each which\r\nrequire special explanation, and those less abnormal qualities which a\r\nphilosophical linguist will easily infer from the principles of general\r\ngrammar, or from a consideration of the common characteristics of the\r\nfamily to which it belongs, that one may learn as much of the real\r\ncharacter of a language, in a few hours, from the few suggestive pages\r\nthe _Mithridates_, as from the tedious and complicated details of its\r\nprofessional grammarians.\r\n\r\nAdelung’s associate in the _Mithridates_ and its continuator, Dr.\r\nSeverinus Vater, was born at Altenburg, in 1771; he studied at Jena and\r\nHalle, in both of which universities he afterwards held appointments\r\nas professor; at Jena, as extraordinary Professor of Theology in 1796,\r\nand at Halle, as Professor of Oriental Languages in 1800. Thence he\r\nwas transferred, in 1809, to Königsberg in the capacity of Professor\r\nof Theology and Librarian; but he returned, in 1820, to Halle, where\r\nhe continued to reside till his death, in 1826. Although Vater was\r\nby no means a very scientific linguist,[148] the importance of his\r\ncontributions to the study of languages cannot be too highly estimated.\r\nBesides the large share which he had in the preparation of the\r\n_Mithridates_ (the last three volumes of which were edited by him,) he\r\nalso wrote well on the grammar of the Hebrew, Polish, Russian, and German\r\nlanguages. Nevertheless, his reputation is rather that of a scholar than\r\nof a linguist.\r\n\r\nA few years after the author of the _Mithridates_ appears the celebrated\r\nPeter Simon Pallas, to whom we are indebted for the great “Comparative\r\nVocabulary” already described. He was born at Berlin in 1741, and his\r\nearly studies were mainly directed to natural philosophy, which he seems\r\nto have cultivated in all its branches. His reputation as a naturalist\r\nprocured for him, in 1767, an invitation from Catherine II. of Russia,\r\nto exchange a distinguished position which he had obtained at the Hague\r\nfor a professorship in the Academy of St. Petersburg. His arrival in that\r\ncapital occurred just at the time of the departure of the celebrated\r\nscientific expedition to Siberia for the purpose of observing the transit\r\nof Venus; and, as their mission also embraced the geography and natural\r\nhistory of Siberia, Pallas gladly accepted an invitation to accompany\r\nthem. They set out in June, 1768, and after exploring the vast plains of\r\nEuropean Russia, the borders of Calmuck Tartary, and the shores of the\r\nCaspian, they crossed the Ural Mountains, examined the celebrated mines\r\nof Catherinenberg, proceeded to Tobolsk, the capital of Siberia, and\r\npenetrated across the mountains to the Chinese frontier, whence Pallas\r\nreturned by the route of Astrakan and the Caucasus to St. Petersburg. He\r\nreached that city in July, 1774, with broken health, and hair prematurely\r\nwhitened by sickness and fatigue. He resumed his place in the Academy;\r\nand was rewarded by the Empress with many distinctions and lucrative\r\nemployments, one of which was the charge of instructing the young\r\ngrand-dukes, Alexander and Constantine. It was during these years that\r\nhe devoted himself to the compilation of the _Vocabularia Comparativa_,\r\nwhich comprises two hundred and one languages; but, in 1795, he returned\r\nto the Crimea, (where he had obtained an extensive gift of territory\r\nfrom the Empress) for the purpose of recruiting his health and pursuing\r\nhis researches. After a residence there of fifteen years, he returned\r\nto Berlin in 1810, where he died in the following year. It will be\r\nseen, therefore, that, prodigious as were his acquirements in that\r\ndepartment, the study of languages was but a subordinate pursuit of this\r\nextraordinary man. His fame is mainly due to his researches in science.\r\nIt is to him that we owe the reduction of the astronomical observations\r\nof the expedition of 1768; and Cuvier gives him the credit of completely\r\nrenewing the science of geology, and of almost entirely re-constructing\r\nthat of natural history. It is difficult, nevertheless,[149] to arrive\r\nat an exact conclusion as to the share which he personally took in the\r\ncompilation of the Vocabulary; and still more so, as to his powers as a\r\nspeaker of foreign languages; although it is clear that his habits of\r\nlife as a traveller and scientific explorer, not only facilitated, but\r\neven directly necessitated for him, the exercise of that faculty, to a\r\nfar greater degree than can be supposed in the case of most of the older\r\nphilologers.\r\n\r\nThe career of Pallas bears a very remarkable resemblance to that of a\r\nmore modern scholar, also a native of Berlin, Julius Henry Klaproth.\r\nHe was the son of the celebrated chemist of that name, and was born in\r\n1783. Although destined by his father to follow his own profession, a\r\nchance sight of the collection of Chinese books in the Royal Library at\r\nBerlin, irrevocably decided the direction of his studies. With the aid\r\nof the imperfect dictionary of Mentzel and Pere Diaz, he succeeded in\r\nlearning without a master that most difficult language; and, though he\r\ncomplied with his father’s desire, so far as to pursue with success the\r\npreparatory studies of the medical profession, he never formally embraced\r\nit. After a time he gave his undivided attention to Oriental studies;\r\nand, in 1802, established, at Dresden, the _Asiatisches Magazin_. Like so\r\nmany of his countrymen, he accepted service in Russia, at the invitation\r\nof Count Potocki, who knew him at Berlin; and he was a member of the\r\nhalf-scientific, half-political, mission to Pekin, in 1805, under that\r\neminent scholar and diplomatist. He withdrew, however, from the main\r\nbody of this expedition, in order to be able to pursue his scientific\r\nresearches more unrestrainedly; and, after traversing eighteen hundred\r\nleagues in the space of twenty months, in the course of which he passed\r\nin review all the motley races of that inhospitable region, Samoiedes,\r\nFinns, Tartars, Monguls, Paskirs, Dzoungars, Tungooses, &c., he returned\r\nto St. Petersburg, in 1806, with a vast collection of notes on the\r\nChinese, Mantchu, Mongul, and Japanese[150] languages. With a similar\r\nobject, he was soon afterwards sent by the Academy, in September, 1807,\r\nto collect information on the languages of the Caucasus, a journey of\r\nexceeding difficulty and privation, in which he spent nearly three years.\r\nOn his return to St. Petersburg, he obtained permission to go to Berlin\r\nfor the purpose of completing the necessary engravings for his work;\r\nand he availed himself of this opportunity to withdraw altogether from\r\nthe Russian service, although with the forfeiture of all his titles\r\nand honours. After a brief sojourn in Italy, he fixed his residence in\r\nParis. To him the _Société Asiatique_ may be said to owe its origin; and\r\nhe acted, almost up to his death in 1835, as the chief editor of its\r\njournal—the well-known _Journal Asiatique_. In Paris, also, he published\r\nhis _Asia Polyglotta_, and “New Mithridates.” Klaproth, perhaps, does not\r\ndeserve, in any one of the languages which he cultivated, the character\r\nof a very deep scholar; but he was acquainted with a large number: with\r\nChinese, Mongol, Mantchu, and Japanese, also with Sanscrit, Armenian,\r\nPersian, and Georgian;[151] he was of course perfectly familiar with\r\nGerman, Russian, French, and probably with others of the European\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nThe eminent historical successes of Berthold George Niebuhr, (born at\r\nCopenhagen in 1776), have so completely eclipsed the memory of all his\r\nother great qualities, that perhaps the reader will not be prepared\r\nto find that in the department of languages his attainments were of\r\nthe highest rank. His father, Carsten Niebuhr, the learned Eastern\r\ntraveller, had destined him to pursue his own career; but the delicacy\r\nof the youth’s constitution, and other circumstances, forced his father\r\nto abandon the idea, and saved young Niebuhr for the far more important\r\nstudies to which his own tastes attracted him. His history, both literary\r\nand political, is too recent and too well known to require any formal\r\nnotice. It will be enough for our purpose to transcribe from his life\r\nan extremely interesting letter from his father, which bears upon the\r\nparticular subject of the present inquiry. It is dated December, 1807,\r\nwhen Niebuhr was little more than thirty years of age. “My son has\r\ngone to Memel,” writes the elder Niebuhr, “with the commissariat of the\r\narmy. When he found he should probably have to go to Riga, he began\r\nforthwith to learn Russian. Let us just reckon how many languages he\r\nknows already. He was only two years old when we came to Meldorf, so\r\nthat we must consider, 1st, German, as his mother tongue. He learned at\r\nschool, 2nd, Latin; 3rd, Greek; 4th, Hebrew; and, besides in Meldorf he\r\nlearned, 5th, Danish; 6th, English; 7th, French; 8th, Italian; but only\r\nso far as to be able to read a book in these languages; some books from a\r\nvessel wrecked on the coast induced him to learn, 9th, Portuguese; 10th,\r\nSpanish; of Arabic he did not know much at home, because I had lost my\r\nlexicon and could not quickly replace it; in Kiel and Copenhagen he had\r\nopportunities of practice in speaking and writing French, English, and\r\nDanish; in Copenhagen he learned, 11th, Persian, of Count Ludolph, the\r\nAustrian minister, who was born at Constantinople, and whose father was\r\nan acquaintance of mine; and 12th, Arabic, he taught himself; in Holland\r\nhe learned, 13th, Dutch; and again, in Copenhagen, 14th, Swedish, and a\r\nlittle Icelandic; at Memel, 15th, Russian; 16th, Slavonic; 17th, Polish;\r\n18th, Bohemian; and, 19th, Illyrian. With the addition of Low German,\r\nthis makes in all twenty languages.”[152]\r\n\r\nAs this letter does not enter into the history of Niebuhr’s later\r\nstudies, I inquired of his friend, the Chevalier Bunsen, whether he had\r\ncontinued to cultivate the faculty thus early developed. I received from\r\nhim the following interesting statement:—“Niebuhr,” he says, “ought not\r\nto be ranked among _Linguists_, in contradistinction with _Philologers_.\r\nLanguage had no special interest for him, beyond what it affords in\r\nconnection with history and literature. His proficiency in languages\r\nwas, however, very great, in consequence of his early and constant\r\napplication to history, and his _matchless memory_. I have spoken of\r\nboth in my _Memoir on Niebuhr_, in the German and English edition of\r\nNiebuhr’s Letters and Life; it is appended to the 2nd volume of both\r\neditions. I think it is somewhere stated how many languages he knew\r\nat an early age. What I know is, that besides _Greek_ and _Latin_, he\r\nlearned early to read and write _Arabic_; _Hebrew_ he had also learned,\r\nbut neglected afterwards; _Russian_ and _Slavonic_ he learned (to read\r\nonly,) in the years 1808, 1810. He wrote well _English_, _French_, and\r\n_Italian_; and read _Spanish_, and _Portuguese_. _Danish_ he wrote as\r\nwell as his mother tongue, _German_, and he understood _Swedish_. In\r\nshort, he would learn with the greatest ease _any language_ which led him\r\nto the knowledge of historical truth, when occupied with the subject; but\r\nlanguage, as such, had no charm for him.”\r\n\r\nAmong the scholars who assisted Adelung and Vater in the compilation of\r\nthe _Mithridates_, by far the most distinguished was the illustrious\r\nCharles William von Humboldt. He was born at Potsdam, in 1767, and\r\nreceived his preliminary education at Berlin. His university studies\r\nwere made partly at Göttingen, partly at Jena, where he formed the\r\nacquaintance and friendship of Goethe, Schiller, Wieland, and, above\r\nall, of Herder, from whose well-known tastes it is highly probable that\r\nHumboldt’s mind received the strong philological bias which it exhibited\r\nduring his life. Unlike most of the scholars who preceded him in this\r\ncareer, however, Humboldt’s life was spent amid the bustle and intrigue\r\nof diplomatical pursuits. He was sent to Rome as Prussian Minister in\r\n1802, and, from that period until 1819, he was almost uniformly employed\r\nin this and similar public services. From his return to Berlin, in 1819,\r\nhe lived almost entirely for science, till his death, which occurred\r\nat Tegel, near Berlin, in 1835. Humboldt is, in truth, the author of\r\nthat portion of the third volume of the _Mithridates_ which treats of\r\nthe languages of the two continents of America; and, although a great\r\npart of its materials were derived from the labours of others—from the\r\nmemoirs, published and unpublished, of the missionaries, from the works\r\nand MSS. of Padre Hervaz, and other similar sources—yet no one can read\r\nany single article in the volume without perceiving that Humboldt had\r\nmade himself thoroughly master of the subject; and that, especially in\r\nits bearings upon the general science of philology, or the great question\r\nof the unity of languages and its kindred ethnological problems, he\r\nhad not only exhausted all the learning of his predecessors, but had\r\nsuccessfully applied to it all the powers of his own comprehensive and\r\noriginal genius. To the consideration, too, of this numerous family of\r\nlanguages he brought a mind stored with the knowledge of all the other\r\ngreat families both of the East and of the West; and although it is not\r\neasy to say what his success in speaking languages may have been, it is\r\nimpossible to doubt either the variety or the solidity of his attainments\r\nboth as a scientific and as a practical linguist. But Humboldt’s place\r\nwith posterity must be that of a philologer rather than of a linguist.\r\nHis Essay on the “Diversity of the Formation of Human Language, and\r\nits Influence on the Intellectual Development of Mankind,” published\r\nposthumously in 1836, as an Introduction to his Analysis of the Kawi\r\nLanguage, is a work of extraordinary learning and research, as well as of\r\nprofound and original thought; analysing all the successive varieties of\r\ngrammatical structure which characterize the several classes of language\r\nin their various stages of structural development, from the naked\r\nsimplicity of Chinese up to the minute and elaborate inflexional variety\r\nof the Sanscritic family. M. Bunsen describes this wonderful work as “the\r\n_Calculus Sublimis_ of linguistic theory,” and declares that “it places\r\nWilliam von Humboldt’s name by the side of that of Leibnitz in universal\r\ncomparative ethnological philology.”[153]\r\n\r\nThe school of Humboldt in Germany has supplied a long series of\r\ndistinguished names to philological literature, beginning with Frederic\r\nvon Schlegel, (whose Essay “On the Language and Literature of the\r\nHindoos, 1808,” opened an entirely new view of the science of comparative\r\nphilology), and continued, through Schlegel’s brother Augustus, Rask,\r\nBopp, Grimm, Lepsius, Pott, Pfizmaier, Hammer-Purgstall (the so-called\r\n“Lily of Ten Tongues”), Sauerwein, Diez, Boehtlingk, and the lamented\r\nCastrén, down to Bunsen, and his learned fellow-labourers, Max Müller,\r\nPaul Boetticher, Aufrecht, and others.[154] For most of those, as for\r\nSchlegel, the Sanscrit family of languages has been the great centre\r\nof exploration, or at least the chief standard of comparison; and\r\nBopp, in his wonderful work, the “Comparative Grammar of the Sanscrit,\r\nZend, Greek, Latin, Lithuanian, old Slavonic, Gothic, and German\r\nLanguages,”[155] has almost exhausted this part of the inquiry. Others\r\n(still, however, with the same general view) have devoted themselves\r\nto other families, as Lepsius to the Egyptian, Rask to the Scythian,\r\nBoehtlingk to the Tartar,[156] Grimm to the Teutonic, Diez to the\r\nRomanic, and Castrén to the Finnic. Others, in fine, as Bunsen in\r\nhis most comprehensive work, “Outlines of the Philosophy of Universal\r\nHistory applied to Language,” (the third volume of his “Christianity and\r\nMankind”) have digested the entire subject, and applied the researches\r\nof all to the solution of the great problem of the science. Some of\r\nthose whom I have named rather resembled the ancient heroes of romance\r\nand adventure, than the common race of quiet everyday scholars. The\r\njourneys of Rask, Klaproth, and Lepsius, were not only full of danger,\r\nbut often attended with exceeding privation; and Alexander Castrén of\r\nHelsingfors was literally a martyr of the science. This enthusiastic\r\nstudent,[157] although a man of extremely delicate constitution, “left\r\nhis study, travelled for years alone in his sledge through the snowy\r\ndeserts of Siberia; coasted along the borders of the Polar Sea; lived for\r\nwhole winters in caves of ice, or in the smoky huts of greasy Samoiedes;\r\nthen braved the sand-clouds of Mongolia; passed the Baikal; and returned\r\nfrom the frontiers of China to his duties as Professor at Helsingfors,\r\nto die after he had given to the world but a few specimens of his\r\ntreasures.”[158]\r\n\r\nRask and M. Bunsen, even as linguists, deserve to be more specially\r\ncommemorated.\r\n\r\nThe former, who was born in 1787 at Brennekilde, in the island of Funen,\r\ntraversed, in the course of the adventurous journey already alluded\r\nto, the Eastern provinces of Russia, Persia, India, Malacca, and the\r\nisland of Ceylon, and penetrated into the interior of Africa. In all\r\nthe countries which he visited he made himself acquainted with the\r\nvarious languages which prevailed; so that besides the many languages\r\nof his native Teutonic family, those of the Scandinavian, Finnic, and\r\nSclavonic stock, the principal cultivated European languages, and the\r\nlearned languages (including those of the Bible), he was also familiar\r\nwith Sanscrit in all its branches; and is justly described as the first\r\nwho opened the way to “a real grammatical knowledge of Zend.”[159] M.\r\nBunsen’s great work exhibits a knowledge of the structural analysis of\r\na prodigious number of languages, from almost every family. As a master\r\nof the learned languages, Hebrew, Greek, Syriac, and (though he has\r\ncultivated these less), Arabic and Persian, he has few superiors. He\r\nspeaks and writes with equal facility Latin, German, English, French,\r\nand Italian, all with singular elegance and purify; he speaks besides\r\nDutch and Danish; he reads Swedish, Icelandic, and the other old German\r\nlanguages, Spanish, Portuguese, and Romaic; and he has also studied many\r\nof the less known languages, as Chinese, Basque, Finnic, and Welsh,\r\ntogether with several of the African and North American languages, but\r\nchiefly with a view to their grammatical structure, and without any idea\r\nof learning to read them.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, with all the linguistic learning which they undoubtedly\r\npossess, neither Humboldt nor the other members of his distinguished\r\nschool fall properly within the scope of this Memoir. With all of them,\r\neven those who were themselves accomplished linguists, the knowledge\r\nof languages, (and especially of their vocabularies), is a subordinate\r\nobject. They have never proposed the study to themselves, for its own\r\nsake, but only as an instrument of philosophical inquiry. It might almost\r\nbe said, indeed, that by the reaction which this school has created\r\nagainst the old system of etymological, and in favour of the structural,\r\ncomparison of languages, a positive discouragement has been given to the\r\nexact or extensive study of their vocabularies. Philologers, as a class,\r\nhave a decided disposition to look down upon, and even to depreciate, the\r\npursuit of linguists. With the former, the knowledge of the words of a\r\nlanguage is a very minor consideration in comparison with its inflexions,\r\nand still more its laws of transposition (Lautverschiebung); Professor\r\nSchott of Berlin plainly avows that “a limited knowledge of languages\r\nis sufficient for settling the general questions as to their common\r\norigin;”[160] and beyond a catalogue of a certain number of words for the\r\npurpose of a comparative vocabulary, there is a manifest tendency on the\r\npart of many, to regard all further concern about the words of a language\r\nas old-fashioned and puerile. It it some consolation to the admirers of\r\nthe old school to know, that, from time to time, learned philologers\r\nhave been roughly taken to task for the presumption with which they have\r\ntheorized about languages of whose vocabulary they are ignorant; and it\r\nis difficult not to regard the unsparing and often very amusing exposures\r\nof Professor Schott’s blunders which occur in the long controversy that\r\nhe has had with Boehtlingk, Mr. Caldwell’s recent strictures[161] upon\r\nthe Indian learning of Professor Max Müller, or Stanislaus Julien’s\r\nstill fiercer onslaught on M. Panthier, in the _Journal Asiatique_,[162]\r\nas a sort of retributive offering to the offended Genius of neglected\r\nEtymology.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI shall not delay upon the Biblical linguists of Germany as Hug, Jahn,\r\nSchott, Windischmann, Vullers, &c., among Catholics, or the rival\r\nschools of Rosenmüller, Tholuck, Ewald, Gesenius, Fürst, Beer, De\r\nLagarde, &c. Extensive[163] as is the range of the attainments of these\r\ndistinguished men in the languages of the Bible, and their literature,\r\nthis accomplishment has now become so universal among German Biblical\r\nscholars, that it has almost ceased to be regarded as a title to\r\ndistinction. Its very masters are lost in the crowd of eminent men who\r\nhave grown up on all sides around him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the scholars of modern Hungary there are a few names which deserve\r\nto be mentioned. Sajnovitz’s work on the common origin of the Magyar\r\nand Lapp languages, though written in 1770, long before the science\r\nof Comparative Philology had been reduced to its present form, has\r\nobtained the praise of much learning and ingenuity. Gyarmathi, who wrote\r\nsomewhat later on the affinity of the Magyar and Finnic languages (1799)\r\nis admitted by M. Bunsen[164] to “deserve a very high rank among the\r\nfounders of that science.” But neither of these authors can be considered\r\nas a linguist. Father Dubrowsky, of whom I shall speak elsewhere,\r\nalthough born in Hungary, cannot properly be considered as a Hungarian.\r\nKazinczy, Kisfaludy, and their followers, have confined themselves almost\r\nentirely to the cultivation of their own native language, or at least to\r\nthe ethnological affinities which it involves.\r\n\r\nI have only discovered one linguist of modern Hungary whom I can consider\r\nentitled to a special notice, but the singular and almost mysterious\r\ninterest which attaches to his name may in some measure compensate for\r\nthe comparative solitude in which it is found.\r\n\r\nI allude to the celebrated Magyar pilgrim and philologer, Csoma de Körös.\r\nHis name is written in his own language, Körösi Csoma Sandor; but in the\r\nworks which he has published (all of which are in English), it is given\r\nin the above form. He was born of a poor, but noble family, about 1790,\r\nat Körös, in Transylvania; and, received a gratuitous education at the\r\nCollege of Nagy-Enyed. The leading idea which engrossed this enthusiastic\r\nscholar during life, was the discovery of the original of the Magyar\r\nrace; in search of which (after preparing himself for about five years,\r\nat Göttingen, by the study of medicine and of the Oriental languages,)\r\nhe set out in 1820, on a pilgrimage to the East, “lightly clad, with a\r\nlittle stick in his hand, as if meditating a country walk, and with but\r\na hundred florins, (about £10), in his pocket.” The only report of his\r\nprogress which was received for years afterwards, informed his friends\r\nthat he had crossed the Balkan, visited Constantinople, Alexandria, and\r\nthe Arabic libraries at Cairo; and, after traversing Egypt and Syria,\r\nhad arrived at Teheran. Here, on hearing a few words of the Tibetan\r\nlanguage, he was struck by their resemblance to Magyar; and, in the hope\r\nof thus resolving his cherished problem, he crossed Little Bucharia\r\nto the desert of Gobi; traversed many of the valleys of the Himalaya;\r\nand finally buried himself for four years (1827-1830), in the Buddhist\r\nMonastery of Kanam, deeply engaged in the study of Tibetan; four months\r\nof which time he spent in a room nine feet square, (without once quitting\r\nit), and in a temperature below zero! He quickly discovered his mistake\r\nas to the affinity of Tibetan with Magyar; but he pursued his Tibetan\r\nstudies in the hope of obtaining in the sacred books of Tibet some light\r\nupon the origin of his nation; and before his arrival at Calcutta, in\r\n1830, he had written down no less than 40,000 words in that language. He\r\nhad hardly reached Calcutta when he was struck down by the mortifying\r\ndiscovery that the Tibetan books to which he had devoted so many precious\r\nyears were but translations from the Sanscrit! From 1830 he resided for\r\nseveral years chiefly at Calcutta, engaged in the study of Sanscrit\r\nand other languages, and employed in various literary services by the\r\nAsiatic Society of Bengal. He published in 1834 a Tibetan and English\r\nDictionary, and contributed many interesting papers to the Asiatic\r\nJournal, and the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society. In 1842, he set\r\nout afresh upon the great pilgrimage which he had made the object of his\r\nlife; and, having reached Dharjeeling on his way to Sikam in Tibet, he\r\nwas seized by a sudden illness, which, as he refused to take medicine,\r\nrapidly carried him off. This strange, though highly gifted man, had\r\nstudied in the course of his adventurous life, seventeen or eighteen\r\nlanguages, in several of which he was a proficient.[165]\r\n\r\nThe career of this enthusiastic Magyar resembles in many respects that\r\nof Castrén, the Danish philologer; and in nothing more than in the\r\ndevotedness with which each of them applied himself to the investigation\r\nof the origin of his native language and to the discovery of the\r\nethnological affinities of his race.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ VI. LINGUISTS OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND.\r\n\r\nThe names with which the catalogue of Italian and that of Spanish\r\nlinguists open, find a worthy companion in the first name among the\r\nlinguists of Britain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith others the study of languages, or of kindred sciences, formed almost\r\nthe business of life. But it was not so with the wonder of his own and of\r\nall succeeding generations—the “Admirable Crichton”; who, notwithstanding\r\nthe universality of his reputation, became almost equally eminent in each\r\nparticular study, as any of those who devoted all their powers to that\r\nsingle pursuit.\r\n\r\nJames Crichton was born in 1561, in Scotland. The precise place of his\r\nbirth is uncertain, but he was the son of Robert Crichton of Eliock,\r\nLord Advocate of James VI. He was educated at St. Andrew’s. The chief\r\ntheatres of his attainments, however, were France and Italy. There\r\nis not an accomplishment which he did not possess in its greatest\r\nperfection—from the most abstruse departments of scholarship, philosophy,\r\nand divinity, down to the mere physical gifts and graces of the musician,\r\nthe athlete, the swordsman, and the cavalier. His memory was a prodigy\r\nboth of quickness and of tenacity. He could repeat verbatim, after a\r\nsingle hearing, the longest and most involved discourse.[166] Many\r\nof the details which are told of him are doubtless exaggerated and\r\nperhaps legendary; but Mr. Patrick Frazer Tytler[167] has shown that the\r\nsubstance of his history, prodigious as it seems, is perfectly reliable.\r\nAs regards the particular subject of our present inquiry, one account\r\nstates that, when he was but sixteen years old, he spoke ten languages.\r\nAnother informs us that, at the age of twenty, the number of languages\r\nof which he was master exactly equalled the number of his years. But the\r\nmost tangible data which we possess are drawn from his celebrated thesis\r\nin the University of Paris, in which he undertook to dispute in any of\r\ntwelve languages—Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, Greek, Latin, Spanish, Italian,\r\nFrench, English, German, Flemish, and Slavonic. I am inclined to believe\r\nthat Crichton’s acquirements extended at least so far as this. It might\r\nseem that a vague challenge to dispute in any one of a number of foreign\r\ntongues was an empty and unsubstantial boast, and a mere exhibition of\r\nvanity, perfectly safe from the danger of exposure. But it is clear\r\nthat Crichton’s challenge was not so unpractical as this. He not only\r\nspecified the languages of his challenge, but there is hardly one of\r\nthose that he selected which was not represented in the University of\r\nParis at the time, not only sufficiently to test the proficiency of the\r\ndaring disputant, but to secure his ignominious exposure, if there were\r\ngrounds to suspect him of charlatanism or imposture. Unhappily, however,\r\nthe promise of a youth so brilliant was cut short by an early death, in\r\n1583, at the age of twenty-two years. Nor did Crichton leave behind him\r\nany work by which posterity might test the reality of his acquirements,\r\nexcept a few Latin verses printed by his friend, Aldus Manutius, on whose\r\ngenerous patronage, with all his accomplishments, he had been dependent\r\nfor the means of subsistence during one of the most brilliant periods of\r\nhis career.\r\n\r\nA few years Crichton’s senior in point of time, although, from the\r\nprecociousness of Crichton’s genius, his junior in reputation, was\r\nLancelot Andrews, Bishop of Winchester. He was born in London in 1555,\r\nand, after a distinguished career in the university, rose, through a long\r\ncourse of ecclesiastical preferments, to the see of Winchester. Beyond\r\nthe general praises of his scholarship in which all his biographers\r\nindulge, few particulars are preserved respecting his attainments. Among\r\nhis contemporaries he was regarded as a prodigy. Wanley says[168] that\r\n“some thought he might almost have served as interpreter-general at the\r\nconfusion of tongues;” and even the more prosaic Chalmers attributes to\r\nhim a profound knowledge of the “chief Oriental tongues, Greek, Latin,\r\nand many modern languages.”[169]\r\n\r\nJohn Gregory, who was born at Agmondesham in Buckinghamshire, in the year\r\n1607, would probably have far surpassed Andrews as a linguist, had he\r\nnot been cut off prematurely before he had completed his thirtieth year.\r\nHe was a youth of unexampled industry and perseverance, devoting sixteen\r\nhours of the twenty-four to his favourite studies. Even at the early age\r\nat which he died he had mastered not only the Oriental and classical\r\nlanguages, but also French, Italian, and Spanish, and, what was far more\r\nremarkable in his day, his ancestral Anglo-Saxon. But he died in the very\r\nblossom of his promise, in 1646.\r\n\r\nThese, however, must be regarded as exceptional cases. The study of\r\nlanguages, it must be confessed, occupied at this period but little\r\nof public attention in England. It holds a very subordinate place in\r\nthe great scheme of Bacon’s “Advancement of Learning.” In the model\r\nRepublic of his “New Atlantis” only four languages appear, “ancient\r\nHebrew, ancient Greek, good Latin of the School, and Spanish.”[170]\r\nGregory’s contemporaries, the brothers John and Thomas Greaves, though\r\nboth distinguished Persian and Arabic scholars, never made a name in\r\nother languages. Notwithstanding the praise which Clarendon bestows on\r\nSelden’s “stupendous learning in all kinds and _in all languages_,”[171]\r\nit is certain that the range of his languages was very limited. So,\r\nalso, what Hallam says of Hugh Broughton as a man “deep in Jewish\r\nerudition,”[172] must be understood rather of the literature than of the\r\nlanguages of the East; and although Hugh Broughton’s namesake, Richard,\r\n(one of the missionary priests in England in the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century, and an antiquarian of considerable merit, mentioned\r\nby Dodd[173]) was a learned Hebraist, there is no evidence of his having\r\ngone farther in these studies.\r\n\r\nIndeed, strange as it may at first sight appear, the first epoch in\r\nEnglish history really prolific in eminent scholars is the stormy period\r\nof the great Civil War. It is not a little remarkable that the most\r\ncreditable fruit of English scholarship, Walton’s Polyglot Bible, was\r\nmatured, if not brought to light, under the Republic.\r\n\r\nThe men who were engaged in this work, however, were, for the most part,\r\nmerely book-scholars. Edmund Castell, born at Halley, in Cambridgeshire,\r\nin 1606, author of the Heptaglot Lexicon, which formed the companion or\r\nsupplement of Walton’s Bible, is admitted to have been one of the most\r\nprofound Orientalists of his day. This Lexicon comprises seven Oriental\r\nlanguages, Hebrew, Chaldee, Samaritan, Syriac, Ethiopic, Arabic, and\r\nPersian; and, if we add to these the classical languages, we shall\r\nfind Castell’s attainments to have been little inferior to those of\r\nany linguist before his time; even without reckoning whatever modern\r\nlanguages he may be supposed to have known. Castell, nevertheless, is one\r\nof the most painful examples of neglected scholarship in all literary\r\nhistory. Disraeli truly says that he more than devoted his life to his\r\nLexicon Heptaglotton.[174] His own Appeal to Charles the Second, if less\r\nnoble and dignified than Johnson’s celebrated preface to the Dictionary,\r\nis yet one of the most touching documents on record. He laments the\r\n“seventeen years during which he devoted sixteen or eighteen hours a day\r\nto his labour. He declares that he had expended his whole inheritance\r\n(above twelve thousand pounds), upon the work; and that he spent his\r\nhealth and eyesight as well as his fortune, upon a thankless task.” The\r\ncopies of his Lexicon remained unsold upon his hands; and, out of the\r\nwhole five hundred copies which he left at his death, hardly one complete\r\ncopy escaped destruction by damp and vermin. “The whole load of learned\r\nrags sold for seven pounds!”[175]\r\n\r\nI cannot find that either Castell or his friend (though by no means his\r\nequal as a linguist), Brian Walton possessed any remarkable faculty in\r\nspeaking even the languages with which they were most familiar.\r\n\r\nAnother of Walton’s associates in the compilation of the Polyglot, as\r\nwell as in other learned undertakings, Edward Pocock (born at Oxford in\r\n1604,) appears to have given more attention to the accomplishment of\r\nspeaking foreign languages. In addition to Latin, Greek, French, and\r\nprobably Italian, he was well versed in Hebrew, Syriac, Ethiopic, and\r\nArabic. During a residence of six years at Aleppo, as British chaplain,\r\n(1600-6), he had the advantage of receiving instructions from a native\r\ndoctor, in the language and literature of Arabia; and he engaged an Arab\r\nservant for the sole purpose of enjoying the opportunity of speaking the\r\nlanguage.[176] In a second journey to the East, undertaken a few years\r\nlater, under the patronage of Laud, he extended his acquaintance with\r\nthese languages. Two of Pocock’s sons, Edward and Thomas, attained a\r\ncertain eminence in the same pursuit; but neither of them can be said to\r\nhave approached the fame of their father.\r\n\r\nThe mention of Arabian literature suggests the distinguished names of\r\nSimon Ockley, the earliest English historian of Mahometanism, and of\r\nGeorge Sale, the first English translator of its sacred book. Both were\r\nin their time Orientalists of high character; but both of them appear\r\nto have applied chiefly to Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, rather than\r\nto the Biblical languages. Both, too, may be cited among the examples\r\nof unsuccessful scholarship. It was in a debtor’s prison at Cambridge\r\nthat Ockley found leisure for the completion of his great History of the\r\nSaracens; and it is told of the learned translator of the Koran, that\r\ntoo often, when he quitted his studies, he wanted a change of linen, and\r\nfrequently wandered in the streets in search of some compassionate friend\r\nwho might supply him with the meal of the day![177]\r\n\r\nAnother scholar of high repute at the same period, is Samuel Clarke. He\r\nwas born at Brackley, in Northamptonshire, in 1623, and was a student at\r\nMerton College, Oxford, when the parliamentary commission undertook the\r\nreform of the University. The general report of the period represents\r\nhim as a very profound and accomplished linguist; but the only direct\r\nevidence which remains of the extent of his powers, is the fact that\r\nhe assisted Walton in the preparation of his Polyglot Bible, and also\r\nCastell in the composition of his Heptaglot Lexicon. He died in 1669.\r\n\r\nEarly in the same century was born John Wilkins, another linguist of some\r\npretensions. Perhaps, however, he is better known by the efforts which\r\nhe made to recommend that ideal project for a Universal Language which\r\nhas occupied the thoughts of so many learned enthusiasts since his time,\r\nthan by his own positive and practical attainments; although he published\r\na Collection of Pater Nosters which possesses no inconsiderable\r\nphilological merit. He was born in 1614, at Fawsley, in Northamptonshire;\r\nand at the early age of thirteen, he was admitted a scholar of Magdalen\r\nCollege, Oxford, where he took his degree in 1634. In the contest\r\nbetween the Crown and the Parliament, Wilkins became a warm partisan\r\nof the latter. He was named Warden of Wadham College, Oxford, by the\r\nparliamentary commission in 1648. Some years later, in 1656, he married\r\nRobina, sister of the Protector, and widow of Peter French; the Protector\r\nhaving granted him a dispensation from the statute which requires\r\ncelibacy, as one of the conditions of the tenure of his Wardenship. In\r\n1659, Richard Cromwell promoted him to the Mastership of Trinity College,\r\nCambridge; from which, however, he was dispossessed at the Restoration.\r\nBut his reputation for scholarship, seemingly through the influence of\r\nBuckingham,[178] outweighed his political demerits; and he was named\r\nsuccessively Dean of Ripon and Bishop of Chester, in which latter dignity\r\nhe died in 1670.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy deistical writer, John Toland, born in the County Donegal,\r\nin Ireland, in 1669, was one of the most skilful linguists of his day.\r\nHis birth was probably illegitimate, and he was baptized by the strange\r\nname of James Junius,[179] which the ridicule of his schoolfellows caused\r\nhim to change for that by which he is now known. During his early youth,\r\nhe was a member of the Catholic religion; but his daring and sceptical\r\nmind early threw off the salutary restraints which that creed imposes,\r\nalthough, like Gibbon, only to abandon Christianity itself in abandoning\r\nCatholicity. His eventful and erratic career does not fall within the\r\nscope of this notice, and I will only mention that in the singular\r\nepitaph, which he composed for his own tomb, he speaks of himself as\r\n“_linguarum plus decem sciens_.” In several of these ten languages, as\r\nhe states in his memorial to the Earl of Oxford,[180] he spoke and wrote\r\nwith as much fluency as in English. Toland died at Putney, in 1722.\r\n\r\nFrom this period the same great blank occurs in the history of English\r\nscholarship, which we have observed in almost all the contemporary\r\nliteratures of Europe. Still a few names may be gleaned from the general\r\nobscurity.[181] It is true that what many persons may deem the most\r\nnotable publication of the time, Chamberlayne’s Collection of Pater\r\nNosters, (1715), was rather a literary curiosity than a work of genuine\r\nscholarship. But there are other higher, though less known, names.\r\n\r\nThe once notorious “Orator Henley,” whom the Dunciad has immortalized as\r\nthe\r\n\r\n    “Preacher at once, and Zany of his age,”\r\n\r\nwas unquestionably a linguist of great acquirements. His “Complete\r\nLinguist,” consisting of grammars of ten languages, was published when\r\nhe was but twenty-five years old; and throughout his entire career,\r\neccentric as it was, he appears to have persevered in the same studies.\r\nJohn Henley was born at Melton Mowbray, in 1692, and graduated in the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge. He took orders, and obtained some notoriety as a\r\npreacher; but his great theatre of display was his so-called “Oratory,”\r\nwhere he delivered orations or lectures on a variety of topics,\r\nreligious, political, humorous, and even profane. It was on one of these\r\noccasions that he drew together a large congregation of shoemakers, by\r\nthe promise of showing them “the best, newest, and most expeditious way\r\nof making shoes,” which he proceeded to illustrate by holding out a boot\r\nand _cutting off the leg part_! Henley died in 1756.[182]\r\n\r\nWhat Henley was in the learned languages, the distinguished statesman\r\nLord Carteret, afterwards Earl of Granville, was in the modern. With all\r\nhis brilliant qualities as a debater, and all his great capacity for\r\npublic affairs, Carteret combined the learning and the accomplishments of\r\na finished scholar. Swift said of him that “he carried away from Oxford\r\nmore Greek, Latin, and philosophy, than became a person of his rank.” He\r\nspoke and wrote French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, German, and even\r\nSwedish; and one of the first causes of the jealousy with which Walpole\r\nregarded him, was the volubility with which he was able to hold converse\r\nin German with their common master, George the First.\r\n\r\nBut Henley and Carteret stand almost alone among the English scholars of\r\nthe early half of the seventeenth century; and the first steady impulse\r\nwhich the study of languages received in England, may be chiefly traced\r\nto the attractions of the honourable and emolumentary service of the\r\nEast India Company. What the diplomatic ambition of France in the Levant\r\neffected among the scholars of that country, the commercial enterprise\r\nof the merchant princess of England achieved in her Indian territory;\r\nand the splendid rewards held out to practical Oriental scholarship,\r\ngave an impulse to the study of Eastern languages on a more liberal\r\nand comprehensive scale.[183] It is in great part to this, that we are\r\nindebted for the splendid successes of Sir William Jones, of Marsden, of\r\nColebrooke, of Craufurd, of Lumsden, of Leyden, and still more recently,\r\nof Colonel Vans Kennedy.\r\n\r\nThe first of these, William Jones, was the son of a school-master,\r\nand was born in London, in 1741. He was educated at Harrow, where\r\nhe exhibited an early taste for languages,[184] and was especially\r\ndistinguished in Greek and Latin metrical composition. In 1764, he\r\nentered the University of Oxford, where he learned Arabic from a Syrian\r\nwhose acquaintance he chanced to form. To this he soon after added\r\nPersian; and in 1770, he performed the very unusual feat of translating\r\nthe history of Nadir Shah into French. In the following year he\r\npublished his Persian Grammar, which took the general public as much by\r\nsurprise, by the beauty and eloquence of the poetical translations which\r\naccompanied the copious examples that illustrated it, as it excited the\r\nadmiration of scholars by the simplicity and practical good sense of its\r\ntechnical details. He soon afterwards applied himself to the language\r\nand literature of China; which, however, he never made a profound study,\r\nas about this time (1770), feeling the precariousness of a purely\r\nliterary profession, he took steps to have himself called to the English\r\nbar, and for the following twelve years devoted himself with all his\r\ncharacteristic energy, and with marked success, to its laborious and\r\nengrossing duties. During the same period he endeavoured unsuccessfully\r\nto obtain a seat in Parliament; but in 1783, he accepted the appointment\r\nof Judge in the supreme court at Calcutta, and repaired to India in\r\nthe same year. His attention to the duties of his office, is said to\r\nhave been most earnest and exemplary. But, in the intervals of duty, he\r\ntravelled over a great part of India; mixed eagerly in native society;\r\nand had acquired a familiarity with the history, antiquities, religions,\r\nscience, and laws of India, such as had never before been attained by\r\nany European scholar, when, unhappily for the science to which he was\r\nso thoroughly devoted, he was cut off prematurely in the year 1794, at\r\nthe early age of forty-seven. During a life thus laborious, and in great\r\npart spent in pursuits utterly uncongenial with linguistic studies, Sir\r\nWilliam Jones had nevertheless amassed a store of languages which had\r\nseldom, perhaps never, been equalled before his time. Fortunately too,\r\nunlike most of the linguists whom we have been enumerating, he himself\r\nleft an autograph record of these studies, which Lord Teignmouth has\r\npreserved in his interesting Biography. In this paper, he describes the\r\ntotal number of languages with which he was in any degree acquainted to\r\nhave been twenty-eight; but he further distributes these into classes\r\naccording to the degree of his familiarity with each. From this curious\r\nmemorandum, it appears that he had studied critically _eight_ languages,\r\nviz:—English, Latin, French, Italian, Greek, Arabic, Persian, Sanscrit;\r\n_eight_ others he had studied less perfectly, but all were intelligible\r\nto him with the aid of a Dictionary, viz:—Spanish, Portuguese, German,\r\nRunick, Hebrew, Bengali, Hindi, Turkish; _twelve_ others, in fine, he\r\nhad studied least perfectly; but he considered all these attainable;\r\nnamely Tibetan, Pali, Palavi, Deri, Russian, Syriac, Ethiopic, Coptic,\r\nWelsh, Swedish, Dutch, and Chinese.[185]\r\n\r\nNow, as Lord Teignmouth[186] describes him as perfectly familiar\r\nwith Spanish, Portuguese, and German, three languages which he has\r\nhimself placed on the list of languages, “less critically studied, but\r\nintelligible with the aid of a dictionary,” it may fairly be believed\r\nthat this estimate is, to say the least, a sufficiently modest one; and\r\nthat his acquaintance even with the languages of the third class was by\r\nno means superficial, we may infer from another memorandum preserved by\r\nLord Teignmouth from which we find that he had studied the grammars of\r\ntwo at least of the number, namely: Russian and Welsh. His biographer,\r\nhowever, unfortunately enters into no details as to his power of speaking\r\nlanguages; but he is said by the writer of the notice in the _Biographie\r\nUniverselle_ to have spoken eight languages as perfectly as his native\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with successes so brilliant as these, the comparatively\r\nhumble career of the other British Orientalists named in conjunction with\r\nSir William Jones, will appear tame and uninteresting. William Marsden\r\nwas born in Dublin, 1754; and, after having completed the ordinary\r\nclassical studies, was sent out to Bencoolen in the island of Sumatra, at\r\nthe early age of sixteen. The extraordinary facility which he exhibited\r\nfor acquiring the Malay languages led to his rapid advancement. He was\r\nnamed first under-secretary, and afterwards chief secretary of the\r\nIsland; and, before his return in 1779, he had accumulated the materials\r\nfor the exceedingly valuable work on Sumatra which he published in 1782.\r\nMarsden held several important appointments after his return,[187] and\r\nhe employed every interval of his official duties in literary pursuits.\r\nHe was a thorough master of Sanscrit, and all its kindred languages;\r\nbut he must be described, nevertheless, rather as a book-learned, than\r\na practical linguist. His Essay on the Polynesian or East Insular\r\nlanguages, tracing their connexion with each other, and their common\r\nrelations with Sanscrit, is still a standard source of information on\r\nthis interesting ethnological question.\r\n\r\nHenry Thomas Colebrooke,[188] well known by his numerous contributions\r\nto Oriental literature, especially in the Asiatic Journal, was also an\r\nofficial of the East India Company, whose employment he entered, while\r\nstill very young, as a civil servant. Colebrooke was well versed, not\r\nonly in the Indian languages, but also in those of the Hebrew and cognate\r\nraces; and his early education in France gave him a greater familiarity\r\nwith French and other modern tongues than is often found to accompany the\r\nmore profound linguistic studies.\r\n\r\nMatthew Lumsden was born in Aberdeenshire in 1777, and went as a mere\r\nboy to India, where his brother had an appointment in the service of the\r\nCompany. Lumsden’s knowledge of Hindostani and of Persian led to his\r\nbeing employed first as translator in the criminal court, and afterwards\r\nas professor in Fortwilliam College, where he remained till 1820. His\r\nskill in Persian and Arabic is attested by several publications upon\r\nboth, chiefly elementary; but he can hardly be classed with the higher\r\nOrientalists, much less with linguists of more universal pretensions.\r\n\r\nLord Cockburn, in the lively section of his amusing “Memorials of his\r\nOwn Time” which he devotes to the singular and unsteady career of John\r\nLeyden, says that M’Intosh, to whom “his wild friend” was clearly a\r\nsource of great amusement, used to laugh at the affected modesty with\r\nwhich Leyden “professed to know _but seventy_ languages.”[189] It is\r\nplain that M’Intosh considered this an extreme exaggeration; but there\r\ncan be no doubt, nevertheless, that Leyden was a very extraordinary\r\nlinguist. This strange man, whose name will perhaps be remembered by\r\nthe frequent allusions to it in the early correspondence of Sir Walter\r\nScott, was born of a very humble family at Denholm in 1775. Though his\r\neducation was of the very lowest order, yet Scott relates that “before he\r\nhad attained his nineteenth year, he confounded the doctors of Edinburgh\r\nby the portentous mass of his acquisitions in almost every department of\r\nknowledge.”[190] Having failed very signally in the clerical profession,\r\nto which he was brought up by his parents, he embraced that of medicine;\r\nand, after undergoing a more than ordinary share of the privations\r\nand vicissitudes of literary life such as it then existed, he went to\r\nMadras in 1803 in the capacity of assistant surgeon in the East India\r\nCompany’s service. The adoption of this career decided the course of his\r\nafter studies. He had learned, while yet a mere youth, preparing for the\r\nuniversity, Hebrew and Arabic. He afterwards extended his researches\r\ninto all the chief languages of the East, Sanscrit, Hindustani, and\r\nmany other minor varieties of the Indian tongues. He was also thorough\r\nmaster of Persian. His career as Professor of Hindustani at Calcutta\r\nwas more successful than that of any European scholar since Sir William\r\nJones. Having also studied the Malay language, from which he made\r\nseveral translations, he was induced to accompany Lord Minto on the Java\r\nexpedition in 1811, where he was cut off after a short illness in the\r\nsame year, too soon, unhappily, to allow of his turning to full account\r\nthe important materials which he had collected for the comparative study\r\nof the Indo-Chinese languages.\r\n\r\nThe well-known evangelical commentator, Dr. Adam Clarke, born in 1760,\r\nof very humble parentage, at Magherafelt, in the County of Londonderry,\r\nin the north of Ireland, and for a long course of years the most\r\ndistinguished preacher of the Methodist communion, enjoyed a high\r\nreputation among his followers as a linguist; but his studies had been\r\nconfined almost entirely to the Biblical languages. The same may be said\r\nof the Rev. Dr. Barrett, vice-provost of Trinity College, Dublin, who is\r\nknown to Biblical students as the editor of the Palimpsest MS. of the\r\nGospels, and of the celebrated Codex Montfortianus.\r\n\r\nBut there is more of curious interest in the career of a very\r\nextraordinary individual, Richard Roberts Jones, of Aberdarvan, in\r\nCarnarvonshire, who, if not for the extent of his attainments, at least\r\nfor the exceedingly unfavourable circumstances under which they were\r\nacquired, deserves a place among examples of the “pursuit of knowledge\r\nunder difficulties.” A privately printed memoir of this singular\r\ncharacter, by Mr. Roscoe, who took much interest in him, and exerted\r\nhimself warmly in his behalf, contains several most curious particulars\r\nregarding his studies and acquirements, as well as his personal habits\r\nand appearance. Mr. Roscoe first met him in 1806, and described him to\r\nDr. Parr as “a poor Welsh fisher-lad, as ragged as a colt, and as uncouth\r\nas any being that has a semblance of humanity. But beneath such an\r\nexterior,” he adds, “is a mind cultivated, not only beyond all reasonable\r\nexpectation, but beyond all probable conception. In his fishing boat on\r\nthe coast of Wales, at an age little more than twenty, he has acquired\r\nGreek, Hebrew, and Latin; has read the Iliad, Hesiod, Theocritus,\r\n&c.; studied the refinements of Greek pronunciation; and examined the\r\nconnection of that language with Hebrew.” An attempt was made to raise\r\nhim to a position more befitting his acquirements. But his habits were\r\nof the rudest and most uncleanly. “He loved to lie on his back in the\r\nbottom of a ditch. His uncouth appearance, solitary habits, and perhaps\r\nweak intellect, made him an object of ridicule and persecution to the\r\nchildren of the district; and, he often _carried an iron pot on his\r\nhead_ to screen him from the stones and clods which they threw at him.\r\nHe wore a large filthy wrapper, in the pockets and folds of which he\r\nstowed his library; and his face, covered with hair, gave him a strangely\r\nuncouth appearance; although the mild and abstracted expression of his\r\nfeatures took from it much of its otherwise repulsive character.” Mr.\r\nRoscoe gives a very curious account of an interview between Dr. Parr and\r\nthis strange genius, in 1815, in the course of which Jones “exhibited a\r\nfamiliarity with French, Italian, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Chaldee.”\r\nHe described too, for Dr. Parr, his mode of acquiring a new language,\r\nwhich consisted in carefully examining its vocabulary, ascertaining\r\nwhat words in it corresponded with those of any language which he had\r\npreviously learned, and _having struck such words out of the vocabulary_,\r\nproceeding to impress the _remaining_ words upon his memory, as being\r\nthe only ones which were peculiar to the new language which he sought to\r\nacquire. It may easily be believed that Jones’s irreclaimably uncouth and\r\neccentric habits defeated the efforts made by his friends to place him\r\nin a condition more befitting his acquirements. Clothes with which their\r\nthoughtfulness might replace his habitual rags, in a few days were sure\r\nto present the same filthy and dilapidated appearance. When a bed was\r\nprovided for him, he chose to sleep not _upon_, but _under_ it; and all\r\nhis habits bespoke at once weakness of mind and indisposition, or perhaps\r\nincapacity, to accommodate himself to the ordinary usages of other men.\r\n\r\nDr. Thomas Young, although his fame must rest chiefly upon his brilliant\r\nphilosophical discoveries, (especially in the Theory of Light), and on\r\nhis success in deciphering and systematizing the hieroglyphical writing\r\nof the Egyptians, as exhibited in the inscriptions of the Rosetta Stone\r\nand in the funereal papyri, cannot be passed over in a history of\r\neminent British linguists. Young was born at Milverton in Somersetshire,\r\nin 1773. His mind was remarkably precocious. He had read the whole\r\nBible twice through, besides other books, before he was four years\r\nold. In his seventh year he learnt Latin; and before he left school\r\nin his thirteenth year, he added to this Greek, French, and Italian.\r\nSoon after his return from school, he mastered Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac,\r\nand Persian; and, in all those languages, as well as in his own, his\r\nreading (of which his journals have preserved a most minute and accurate\r\nrecord), was so various and so vast, as almost to exceed belief. Having\r\nembraced the medical profession, he passed two years in different German\r\nUniversities, during which time he not only extended his knowledge of\r\nlearned languages, but also became perfect master of German;—not to speak\r\nof various other acquisitions, some of them of a class which are seldom\r\nfound to accompany scholastic eminence, such as riding two horses at\r\nthe same time, walking or dancing on the tight rope, and various other\r\nfeats of harlequinade! Of his skill in the ancient Egyptian language, as\r\nwell as its more modern forms, in which he rivalled, and as his English\r\nbiographer, Dr. Peacock, seeks to show,[191] surpassed, Champollion and\r\nLepsius, it is unnecessary to speak: and it is highly probable that,\r\nhaving learned Italian while a mere youth,[192] he also made himself\r\nacquainted with Spanish, and perhaps Portuguese.\r\n\r\nDr. Pritchard, who may be regarded as the founder of the English\r\nschool of ethnography, can hardly, notwithstanding, be strictly called\r\na linguist. If we except the Celtic languages, and Greek, Latin, and\r\nGerman, most of his learning regarding the rest is taken at second-hand\r\nfrom Adelung and others. Nevertheless, the linguistic section of his\r\n“Researches into the Physical History of Mankind,” is a work of very\r\ngreat value. M. Bunsen pronounces it “the best of its kind; infinitely\r\nsuperior, as a whole, to Adelung’s _Mithridates_”;[193] and Cardinal\r\nWiseman, in his masterly lecture “On the Natural History of the Human\r\nrace,” not only gives Pritchard the credit of being “almost the first who\r\nattempted to connect ethnography with philology,” but even goes so far\r\nas to say that it will henceforth “be difficult for any one to treat of\r\nthis theme without being indebted to Dr. Pritchard for a great portion of\r\nhis materials.”[194]\r\n\r\nOf the school of living British linguists I shall not be expected to\r\nspeak at much length; but there are a few names so familiar to the\r\nscholars of every country that it would be unpardonable to pass them over\r\nentirely without notice.\r\n\r\nThe work just quoted, from the very time of its publication in 1836,\r\nestablished the reputation of Dr. (now Cardinal) Wiseman, still a very\r\nyoung writer, as a philologist of the first rank. His latest writings\r\nshow that, through all the engrossing duties in which he has since been\r\nengaged, he has continued to cultivate the science of philology.[195]\r\nThe Cardinal is, moreover, a most accomplished linguist. Besides the\r\nordinary learned languages, he is master not only of Hebrew and Chaldee,\r\nbut also of Syriac (of his scholarship in which his _Horæ Syriacæ_ is\r\na most honourable testimony), Arabic, Persian, and Sanscrit. In modern\r\nlanguages he has few superiors. He speaks with fluency and elegance\r\nFrench, Italian, German, Spanish, and Portuguese; and in most of these\r\nlanguages he has frequently preached or lectured extempore, or with\r\nlittle preparation.\r\n\r\nThe interesting discoveries of Colonel Rawlinson and of Dr. Hincks, and\r\nDr. Cureton’s very important Syriac publications, have associated their\r\nnames with the linguistic as well as the antiquarian memories of this\r\nage. Nor are there many English Orientalists whose foreign reputation is\r\nso high as that of Mr. Lane. But I am unable to speak of the attainments\r\nof any of these gentlemen in the other families of language.\r\n\r\nBy far the most noticeable names in the list of living linguists of\r\nBritish race are those of Sir John Bowring, now Governor at Hong-Kong,\r\nProfessor Lee of Cambridge, and the American ex-blacksmith, Elihu\r\nBurritt. All three, beyond their several degrees of personal merit,\r\npossess a common claim to admiration, as being almost entirely\r\nself-educated. John (now Sir John) Bowring, as I learn from a Memoir\r\npublished about three years since,[196] before he had attained his\r\neighteenth year, had learned Latin, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese,\r\nGerman, and Dutch. He is said to have since added to his store almost\r\nevery language of Europe;—Russian, Servian, Bohemian, Polish, Hungarian,\r\nSlovakian, Swedish, Danish, Icelandic, Lettish, Finnish, and even Basque;\r\nand he is further described as familiar with all the provincial varieties\r\nof each; for instance, of the various offshoots of German, and of the\r\nseveral dialects of Spanish which prevail in Catalonia, Valencia and\r\nGalicia. Dr. Bowring’s later career brought him into familiarity with\r\nArabic and Turkish; and his still more recent successes in China and in\r\nSiam and its dependencies are equally remarkable. It is not so easy to\r\noffer an opinion as to the degree of Sir John Bowring’s acquaintance with\r\neach of the languages which are ascribed to him. His interesting poetical\r\ntranslations from Russian, Servian, Bohemian, and other languages of\r\nEurope, are rather a test of elegant literary tastes than of exact\r\nlinguistic attainments; nor am I aware to what more direct ordeal his\r\nvarious attainments have been subjected. It were to be wished that the\r\nMemoir from which these particulars are derived had entered more into\r\ndetail upon this part of the subject. But, even making every allowance\r\nfor possible exaggeration, it seems impossible to doubt the claim of Sir\r\nJohn Bowring to a place in the very highest rank of modern linguists.\r\n\r\nDr. Samuel Lee is perhaps even a still more extraordinary example of\r\nself-education. He was born in the very humblest rank in the village\r\nof Longnor in Shropshire, and, after having spent a short time in the\r\npoor-school of his native village, commenced life as a carpenter’s\r\napprentice, when he was but twelve years old. In the few intervals of\r\nleisure which this laborious occupation permitted, Mr. Jerdan states[197]\r\nthat, without the least assistance from masters, he taught himself Latin,\r\nGreek, Hebrew, and Chaldee; having contrived, from the hoardings of\r\nhis scanty wages, to procure a few elementary books in these and other\r\nlanguages. On his marriage, however, he was forced to sell the little\r\nlibrary which he had accumulated, in order to provide for the new wants\r\nwith which he found himself encompassed: and for a time his struggle\r\nafter learning was suspended; but his extraordinary attainments having\r\nbegun to attract notice, he was relieved from the uncongenial occupation\r\nwhich he had hitherto followed, and appointed master of a school at\r\nShrewsbury. In the more favourable position which he had thus obtained,\r\nhe soon extended his reading to Arabic, Persian, and Hindustani. In 1813\r\nhe entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where it is worthy of note that\r\nhe distinguished himself no less in science than in languages, and took\r\nhis degree with much credit. He was afterwards appointed superintendent\r\nof the Oriental press of the British and Foreign Bible Society, for which\r\nbody he has not only edited the Arabic, Persian, Coptic, Hindustani,\r\nMalay, and other versions of the Bible, but has also translated, or\r\nsuperintended the translation, of many tracts in these various languages.\r\nWhen Mr. Wheaton, an American traveller, (brother of the well-known\r\nAmerican jurist of that name) visited Professor Lee, he found him\r\nacquainted with no less than “sixteen languages, in most of which he\r\nwas able to write.”[198] Neither this writer, however, nor Mr. Jerdan,\r\ninforms us as to the extent of Dr. Lee’s attainments in speaking foreign\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nThe list of linguists of the British race may be closed not unworthily\r\nwith the still more remarkable name of Elihu Burritt, who, though born\r\nin America (in 1811,) is descended of an English family, settled in\r\nConnecticut for the last two centuries. The circumstances of Burritt’s\r\nfather, who was a shoemaker, were so narrow, that the education of\r\nElihu, the youngest of five sons, was entirely neglected. When his\r\nfather died, Elihu, then above fifteen years old, had spent but three\r\nmonths at school; and, being altogether dependent on his own exertions\r\nfor support, he was obliged to bind himself as an apprentice to the\r\ntrade of blacksmith. Fortunately, however, an elder brother who was\r\na schoolmaster, settled in the same town before the term of Elihu’s\r\napprenticeship expired; and as the latter had carefully devoted each\r\nspare moment of his laborious life to reading every book that came within\r\nhis reach, he gladly availed himself, as soon as he became his own\r\nmaster, of his brother’s offer to take him as a pupil for half a year,\r\nwhich was all the time he could hope to spare from his craft. During that\r\ntime, brief as it was, Elihu “became well versed in mathematics, went\r\nthrough Virgil in the original, and read several French books.” Having\r\nthus laid the foundation, he returned to his trade, resolved to labour\r\ntill he should have acquired the means of completing the work; and, in\r\nthe strong passion for knowledge which devoured him, he actually engaged\r\nhimself to do the work of two men, in order that, by receiving double\r\nwages, he might more quickly realize the desired independence. Yet, even\r\nwhile he was thus doubly tasked, and while his daily hours of labour were\r\nno less than fourteen, he contrived to give some time in the mornings and\r\nevenings to Latin, French, and Spanish; and he actually procured a small\r\n“Greek grammar, which would just _lie in the crown of his hat_, and used\r\nto carry it with him to read during his work—the casting of brass cow\r\nbells, a task which required no small amount of attention!”\r\n\r\nWith the little store which he thus toilfully accumulated, he betook\r\nhimself to New Haven, the seat of Yale College, although without a hope\r\nof being able to avail himself of its literary advantages. Here too he\r\nworked almost unaided. He took lodgings at an inn frequented by the\r\nstudents, though too poor to enter the university; and in the course of\r\na few months, by unremitting study, he read through the whole Iliad in\r\nGreek, and had made considerable progress in Italian and German, besides\r\nextending his knowledge of Spanish and French. Having obtained, soon\r\nafterwards, a commercial appointment, he was partially released, for a\r\nspace, from the mechanical drudgery in which he was so long engaged; and,\r\nas he was thus enabled to devote a little more time to his favourite\r\nstudies, he contrived to learn Hebrew, and made his first advance towards\r\na regular course of Oriental reading. But this interval of rest was a\r\nbrief one; after a very mortifying failure, he was at last compelled to\r\nreturn once more to the anvil, as his only sure resource against poverty.\r\nStill, nevertheless, he toiled on in his enthusiastic struggle for\r\nknowledge. Even while engaged in this painful drudgery, “every moment,”\r\nsays Mrs. Howitt,[199] “which he could steal out of the four-and-twenty\r\nhours was devoted to study; he rose early in the winter mornings, and,\r\nwhile the mistress of the house was preparing breakfast by lamplight,\r\nhe would stand by the mantel-piece, with his Hebrew Bible on the shelf,\r\nand his lexicon in his hand, thus studying while he ate; the same method\r\nwas pursued at the other meals; mental and bodily food being taken in\r\ntogether. This severe labour of mind, as might be expected, produced\r\nserious effects on his health; he suffered much from headaches, the\r\ncharacteristic remedy for which were two or three additional hours of\r\nhard forging, and a little less study.”\r\n\r\nAn extract from his own weekly Diary, which Mrs. Howitt has preserved,\r\ntells the story of his struggle still more touchingly:—“_Monday_, June\r\n18, headache; forty pages Cuvier’s Theory of the Earth, sixty-four pages\r\nFrench, eleven hours forging. _Tuesday_, sixty-five lines of Hebrew,\r\nthirty pages of French, ten pages Cuvier’s Theory, eight lines Syriac,\r\nten ditto Danish, ten ditto Bohemian, nine ditto Polish, fifteen names of\r\nstars, ten hours forging. _Wednesday_, twenty-five lines Hebrew, fifty\r\npages of astronomy, eleven hours forging. _Thursday_, fifty-five lines\r\nHebrew, eight ditto Syriac, eleven hours forging. _Friday_, unwell;\r\ntwelve hours forging. _Saturday_, unwell; fifty pages Natural Philosophy,\r\nten hours forging. _Sunday_, lesson for Bible class.”\r\n\r\nThrough these and many similar difficulties, has this extraordinary man\r\nfound his way to eminence. Without attempting to chronicle the stages\r\nof his progress, it will be enough to state that a writer of last year\r\ndescribes him as at present acquainted with eighteen languages, besides\r\nhis native English, viz:—Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Syriac, Samaritan, Arabic,\r\nTurkish, Persian, Ethiopic, Italian, French, Spanish, German, Danish,\r\nIrelandic, Esthonian, Bohemian, and Polish.[200] He is author of several\r\nworks, and was for some time Editor of a Journal entitled “The Christian\r\nCitizen.”\r\n\r\nAs in the case of Dr. Lee, no attempt is made, in either of the\r\nbiographies of Burritt which I have consulted, to define with exactness\r\nthe degree of his knowledge of each among the various languages which he\r\nhas learned; but if his proficiency in them be at all considerable, his\r\nposition among linguists must be admitted to be of the very highest; and\r\nas he is still only in his forty-sixth year, it would be difficult to\r\npredict what may be the limit of his future successes.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ VII. LINGUISTS OF THE SLAVONIC RACE.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary capacity of the Slavonic races for the acquisition of\r\nforeign languages, has long been a subject of observation and of wonder.\r\nIn every educated foreign circle Russians and Poles may be met, whom it\r\nis impossible to distinguish, by their language, or even by their accent,\r\nfrom the natives of the country: and this accomplishment is frequently\r\nfound to embrace the entire range of the polite languages of Europe. In\r\nthe higher native Russian society, it is rare to meet one who does not\r\nspeak several languages, besides his own. Every candidate for public\r\noffice in Russia, especially in connexion with foreign affairs, must be\r\nmaster of at least four languages, French, German, English, and Italian;\r\nand in the Eastern governments of the empire, are constantly to be found\r\nemployés, who, to the ordinary stock of European languages, add an equal\r\nnumber of the dialects of the Asiatic races subject to the Czar.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, however, this facility in the use of foreign languages\r\nenjoyed by the natives of Russia and Poland, is chiefly conversational,\r\nand acquired rather by practice than by study; and, among the numbers\r\nwho, during the last three centuries, must be presumed to have possessed\r\nthis gift in an eminent degree, very few appear to have acquired a\r\npermanent reputation as scholars in the higher sense of the name.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, too, even were it otherwise, the materials for a history\r\nof Russian linguists are extremely scanty. Not one of those who have\r\nwritten upon Slavonic Literature, appears to have adverted to this\r\nas a distinct branch of scholarship; Slavonic scholars, too, have\r\nmet but imperfect justice from the writers on general biography; and\r\nthus, especially for one to whom the native sources of information are\r\ninaccessible, the rare allusions which can be gleaned from the general\r\nhistory of Slavonic literature supply but an uncertain and imperfect\r\nguide,[201] even did opportunities present themselves for pursuing the\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nIt would be unpardonable, nevertheless, to pass the subject over in\r\nsilence; and I can only renew in especial reference to this part of the\r\nmemoir, the claim for indulgence with which I entered upon this Essay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChristianity, and with it the first seeds of civilization, reached\r\nRussia from Constantinople; and it is not unlikely that the friendly and\r\nfrequent intercourse which subsisted between the two courts under the\r\nfirst Christian Dukes of Muscovy, Vladimir and Jaroslav, may have led to\r\na considerable interchange of language between the members of the two\r\nnations. The many foreign alliances, too, with Constantinople, Germany,\r\nHungary, France, England, Norway, and Poland, which were formed by\r\nthe children of Jaroslav, may, perhaps, have tended to familiarize his\r\nsubjects, or at least his court, with some of the languages of Southern\r\nand Western Europe. But no record of this—the one bright period in early\r\nRussian history—has been preserved, from which any particulars can be\r\ngleaned.\r\n\r\nThe division of Jaroslav’s dominions between his sons at his death, (in\r\n1054,) plunged the Russian nation into a series of civil wars and into\r\nthe barbarism to which such wars lead, from which it did not begin to\r\nemerge till the sixteenth century; and, although a few translations\r\n(chiefly theological), from Greek and Latin, were made during this\r\nperiod, yet, from the interruption of all intercourse with foreign\r\ncountries, it may be presumed that (with the exception, perhaps, of a\r\nfew enterprising individuals, like the merchant Nikitin,[202] who, in\r\nthe fifteenth century, traversed the entire East, and penetrated as far\r\nas Tibet,) the natives of an empire so completely isolated concerned\r\nthemselves little about any language beyond their own.\r\n\r\nMacarius, who was Metropolitan of Moscow in the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, did something to promote the introduction of foreign letters\r\ninto Russia,[203] and many translations, not only from the Greek and\r\nLatin fathers, but also from the classical writers, were made under\r\nhis direction. A still greater impulse must have been given to this\r\nparticular branch of study by the new policy introduced by the Czar Boris\r\nFeodorowitsch Godounoff, who not only invited learned foreigners to his\r\ncourt, but sent eighteen young nobles of Russia to foreign countries to\r\nstudy their arts, their literature and their languages.[204]\r\n\r\nThe results of this more liberal policy, however, had hardly begun to\r\nbe felt, when the troubles which followed the well-known revolution of\r\nDemetrius the Impostor, revived for a time the worst forms of barbarism\r\nin the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe elevation (in 1613,) of the family of Romanoff to the throne, in\r\nthe person of the Czar Michael, by restoring a more settled government,\r\ncontributed to advance the cause of letters. The monk Beründa Pameva,\r\npublished about this time a Slavo-Russian Lexicon, which exhibits in its\r\netymologies an acquaintance with Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.[205]\r\n\r\nA school was founded at Moscow by the priest-monk Arsenius, for the\r\nstudy of Greek and Latin, in 1643, one of the scholars of which,\r\nTheodore Rtischtscheff, founded a society for translating works from\r\nforeign languages in 1649; and another school of still more wide-spread\r\ninfluence was opened in the Monastery of Saikonosspassk, in 1682. It is\r\nworthy of remark, nevertheless, that the first Russian grammar, that of\r\nLudolf,[206] was printed, not at any native press, but in the University\r\nof Oxford.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of the Translation Society alluded to above, the\r\nmonk Epiphanius Slawinezki, appears to have been regarded by his\r\ncontemporaries as a linguist of notable attainments. He published\r\na Greek, Latin, and Slavonic Dictionary, and commenced a Slavonic\r\ntranslation of the Bible from the original Greek, which was cut short\r\nby his death in 1676; but there is no reason to believe that he was\r\nacquainted with any of the Oriental languages; and the inference to be\r\ndrawn from the reputation which he enjoyed on so slight a foundation, is\r\nfar from creditable to the linguistic attainments of his time.\r\n\r\nIt is only from the reign of Peter the Great that the history of\r\nthis, as of all other branches of Russian enlightenment, may be\r\nproperly said to commence. Independently of the encouragement which\r\nPeter held out to foreign talent to devote itself to his service, the\r\ngrand and comprehensive scheme of the academy which he planned under\r\nthe direction of Leibnitz, contained a special provision for the\r\ndepartment of languages.[207] And although it was not formally opened\r\nuntil after Peter’s death, by the Empress Catherine I. (1725), the\r\ninfluence of the policy in which it originated, had made itself felt\r\nlong before. The Czar’s favourite, Mentschikoff, who from an obscure\r\norigin (1674-1729) built up the fortunes of what is now one of the\r\ngreatest houses of Russia, was master of eight languages, most of which\r\nhe spoke with perfect fluency. Demetrius Kantemir, (1673-1723), father\r\nof the celebrated poet of that name, deserves also to be noticed. He\r\nwas descended of a Turkish family, and held the office of Hospodar of\r\nMoldavia; but he prized his literary reputation more than his rank. He\r\nappears to have been a scholar in the highest sense of the name, and\r\nwas familiarly acquainted, not only with the living languages which\r\nare so easily acquired by his countrymen, but with several of the\r\nlearned languages, both of the East and the West.[208] The poet, his\r\nson Antiochus Demetrjewitsch, is also described as “master of several\r\nlanguages, ancient and modern.”[209] The same may be inferred regarding\r\nthe great traveller, Basilius Gregorowitsch Barskj, who was born at\r\nKiew, in 1702. He must necessarily have acquired, during his long and\r\nadventurous wanderings in Europe and the East, a familiarity with many\r\nof the languages of the various countries through which he journeyed,\r\nalthough he was prevented from turning it to account upon his return to\r\nRussia by his premature death in 1747.[210]\r\n\r\nBasilius Nikititsch Tatisscheff, one of the youths sent abroad by Peter\r\nthe Great, for the purpose of studying in the foreign universities,\r\nenjoyed a considerable reputation as a linguist.[211] The History of\r\nRussia which he compiled, supposes a familiarity with several Asiatic,\r\nas well as European languages; but, as it is not improbable that part\r\nof the materials which he employed in this history were translated\r\nfor his use by assistants engaged for the purpose, it may be doubted\r\nwhether this can be assumed as a fair test of his own capabilities. The\r\nlinguistic attainments of the celebrated poet Lemonossoff,[212] although\r\nconsiderable, form his least solid title to fame. His history is so\r\nfull of interest, that its incidents, almost utterly unvarnished, have\r\nsupplied the narrative of one of the most popular of modern Russian\r\nnovels. Born (1711) in a rude fisher’s hut in the wretched village\r\nof Denissowka on the shore of the Frozen Ocean, he rose by his own\r\nunassisted genius not only to high eminence in science, but to the\r\nvery first rank in the literature of his native country, of which he\r\nmay truly be described as the founder; and, although he does not seem\r\nto have made languages a special study, he deserves to be noticed even\r\nin this department. He was perfect master of Greek, Latin, French,\r\nand German; and possessed with other ancient and modern languages, an\r\nacquaintance sufficient for all the purposes of study. The attainments\r\nof his contemporary, Basilius Petrowitsch Petroff, (1736) were\r\nperhaps more profound. He was a scholar of the celebrated convent of\r\nSaikonosspassk; and having attracted notice by an ode which he composed\r\nfor the coronation of the Empress Catherine, he was employed, through the\r\ninfluence of Potemkin, at the English and several other European courts.\r\nThrough the opportunities which he thus enjoyed, he became one of the\r\nbest linguists of his day, and we may form an estimate of his zeal and\r\nperseverance from the circumstance of his having learned Romaic after his\r\nsixtieth year.[213] Gabriel, Archbishop of St. Petersburg, (1775-1801)\r\nand one of the most distinguished pulpit orators of Russia, is also\r\nmentioned as a very remarkable linguist.[214] His success, however, lay\r\nchiefly in modern languages.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent scholars engaged in the philological and ethnological\r\ninvestigations undertaken by the Empress Catherine II. were foreigners;\r\nas, for example, Pallas, and Bakmeister. Some, however, were native\r\nRussians, but few details are preserved regarding them. Of Sujeff, who\r\naccompanied Pallas in the expedition to Tartary and China, and who\r\ntranslated the journals of the expedition into Russian,[215] I have not\r\nbeen able to obtain any particulars. I have been equally unsuccessful\r\nas to the history of Theodore Mirievo de Jankiewitsch, the compiler of\r\nthe alphabetical Digest of Pallas’s Comparative Vocabulary, described in\r\na former page; but it can scarcely be doubted, from the very nature of\r\nhis task, that he must have been a man of no ordinary acquirements as a\r\nlinguist, at least as regards the vocabularies of language.\r\n\r\nDuring the present century a good deal has been done in Russia for\r\nthe cultivation of particular families of languages. The “Lazareff\r\nInstitute,” founded at Moscow in 1813,[216] by an Armenian family from\r\nwhich it takes its name, comprehends in its truly munificent scheme\r\nof education not only the Armenian, Georgian, and Tartar languages,\r\nbut also the several members of the Caucasian family.[217] An Oriental\r\nInstitute[218] on a somewhat similar plan was established at St.\r\nPetersburg in 1823. Another was opened at the still more favourable\r\ncentre of languages, Odessa, in 1829; and a fourth, yet more recently,\r\nat Kazan, the meeting point of the two great classes of languages\r\nwhich practically divide between them the entire Russian Empire.[219]\r\nIndividual scholars, too, have taken to themselves particular branches\r\nof the study, some of them with very remarkable success. Timkoffsky, the\r\nwell-known missionary in China,[220] and Hyacinth Bitchourin, who was\r\nhead of the Pekin Russian Mission from 1808 to 1812, have contributed to\r\npopularize the study of Chinese.[221] Igumnoff of Irkutsch published a\r\nuseful dictionary of the Mongol: Giganoff, and more recently Volkoff, a\r\ndictionary of the Tartar languages; of which Mirza Kazem-Beg, professor\r\nof the Turkish and Tartar languages at St. Petersburg, has compiled an\r\nexcellent grammar. The same service has been rendered to the language\r\nof Georgia and its several dialects by David Tchubinoff.[222] The\r\nnumerous philological writings of Goulianoff, too, and, more lately,\r\nPrince Alexander Handjeri’s _Dictionnaire Français, Arabe, Persan, et\r\nTurc_,[223] have established a European reputation.\r\n\r\nThe present Prefect Apostolic of the Arctic Missions, who is a convert\r\nfrom the Russian Church, is said to be a very extraordinary linguist.\r\nEven before he entered upon his missionary charge, in which, of course,\r\nthe circle of his languages is much enlarged, he habitually heard\r\nconfessions, at Paris, in six languages.\r\n\r\nPerhaps also it may be permitted to enumerate among Russian linguists\r\nthree eminent literary men who have long been resident at St. Petersburg,\r\nand who, although not natives of Russia, may now be regarded as\r\nnaturalised subjects of the Empire—Senkowsky, Gretsch and Mirza Kazem-Beg.\r\n\r\nThe first is by birth a Pole;[224] but having early attained to much\r\neminence as an Orientalist, and having travelled with some reputation as\r\nan explorer in Syria and Egypt, he obtained the Professorship of Oriental\r\nlanguages in the university of St. Petersburg, in which he has since\r\ndistinguished himself by an important controversy with the celebrated\r\nVon Hammer. Senkowsky, since his residence in St. Petersburg, has made\r\nthe Russian language his own, and is one of the most prolific writers\r\nin the entire range of modern Russian literature. His grammar of that\r\nlanguage is among the most intelligible to foreigners that has ever been\r\nissued. With most of the languages of Europe, he is said to be perfectly\r\nfamiliar, and his attainments as an Orientalist are of the very highest\r\nrank. He is a corresponding member of the Asiatic Societies of most of\r\nthe capitals of Europe, and publishes indifferently in Polish, Russian,\r\nGerman, and French.\r\n\r\nGretsch, the editor of the well-known St. Petersburg Journal, “The\r\nNorthern Bee,” is perhaps less profound, but equally varied in his\r\nattainments. Although a German by birth, he writes exclusively in\r\nRussian, and is the author of the best and most popular extant history\r\nof Russian literature; of which Otto’s _Lehrbuch der Russischen\r\nLiteratur_, although apparently an independent work, is almost a literal\r\ntranslation.[225]\r\n\r\nMirza Kazem-Beg is of the Tartar race, but a native of Astracan, where\r\nhis father, a man of much reputation for learning, had settled about\r\nthe commencement of the century. Soon after the establishment of the\r\nprofessorship of the Turkish and Tartar languages at Kazan, Kazem-Beg was\r\nselected to fill it; and, after some time, he was removed to the same\r\nchair in the University of Petersburg, which he still holds. Besides the\r\nordinary learned languages, he is acquainted with the Hebrew, Chaldee,\r\nArabic, Syrian, Persian, and Turkish, as well as those of the Tartar\r\nstock; and he is described as perfect master of the modern European\r\nlanguages, especially French, Italian, German, and English. The last\r\nnamed language he speaks and writes with great ease and elegance, and\r\nhas even published some translations into it, as, for example, the\r\n“Derbend-Nâmeh.”[226]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe reputation of the Poles as linguists is equally high. So far back\r\nas the election of Henry de Valois, Choisnin, who accompanied Henry\r\nto Poland, says that of the two hundred Polish nobles who were then\r\nassembled, there were hardly two who did not speak, in addition to their\r\nnative Polish, German, Italian, and Latin.[227] So universal was the\r\nknowledge of the last named language that, with perhaps a pardonable\r\nexaggeration, Martin Kromer alleges that there were fewer in Poland than\r\nin Latium itself who did not speak it.[228]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, few names present themselves in this department which have\r\nleft any permanent trace in history. Francis Meninski, the learned author\r\nof the _Thesaurus Linguarum Orientalium_,[229] was not only a profound\r\nscholar in most of the ancient and modern languages, but, from his long\r\nresidence in the East, and from the office of Oriental Interpreter which\r\nhe held, first in the Polish and afterwards in the Imperial service, must\r\nbe presumed to have spoken them freely and familiarly. But Meninski was a\r\nnative of Lorraine, and by some is believed to have been originally named\r\n_Menin_, and only to have adopted the Polish affix, _ski_, on receiving\r\nfrom the Diet his patent of naturalization and nobility.\r\n\r\nAmong the early Polish Jesuits were many accomplished classical and\r\nOriental linguists, but in the absence of any particulars of their\r\nattainments, it would be uninteresting to enumerate them. In later times\r\nthe names of Groddek and Bobrowski may be mentioned as philologers,\r\nif not as linguists. The learned Jesuit historian, John Christopher\r\nAlbertrandy, also, possesses this among many other lilies to fame. He\r\nwas a most laborious and successful collector of materials for Polish\r\nhistory, in search of which he explored the libraries of Italy, from\r\nwhence he carried home, after three years of patient research, a hundred\r\nand ten folio volumes of extracts copied with his own hand! From Italy\r\nhe proceeded to Stockholm and Upsala, where many important documents\r\nconnected with the time of John III. and Sigismond III. are preserved:\r\nand here, being, from some unworthy jealousy, only permitted to inspect\r\nthe desired documents on the condition of not making notes or copies in\r\nthe library, his prodigious memory enabled him on his return each evening\r\nto his apartments, to commit to writing what he had read during the day,\r\nand the collection thus formed amounted to no fewer than ninety folio\r\nvolumes![230] Albertrandy’s historical works are very numerous; and when\r\nhis labours in this department are remembered, his success as a linguist\r\nwill appear almost prodigious. Besides Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, he knew\r\nmost of the modern languages, French, English, Italian, German, and\r\nRussian, and spoke the majority of them with ease and propriety.\r\n\r\nThe well-known Polish General, Wenceslaus Rzewuski, devoted the later\r\nyears of his busy and chequered career to literary, and especially to\r\nlinguistic, pursuits. He is said to have spoken the learned tongues\r\nas well and as freely as his native Polish, and to have been master,\r\nmoreover, of all the leading modern languages of Europe. The great\r\nOriental Journal published at Vienna, _Fundgruben des Orients_, which is\r\nreally what its title implies, a _mine_ of Oriental learning, was for\r\nmany years under his superintendence.\r\n\r\nThe Russo-Polish diplomatist, Count Andrew Italinski, is another example\r\nof the union of profound scholarship with great talents for public\r\naffairs. Born in Poland about the middle of the eighteenth century,\r\nItalinski visited in the successive stages of his education, Kiew,\r\nLeyden, Edinburgh, London, Paris, and Berlin, and acquired the languages\r\nof all those various countries. Being eventually appointed to the Russian\r\nembassy in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, he became even more perfect\r\nin Italian. In addition to all these languages, he was so thoroughly\r\nmaster of those of the East, Turkish, Arabic, Persian, &c., as to\r\nchallenge the admiration even of the Easterns themselves.[231]\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps right to add that the eminent Orientalist of St.\r\nPetersburg, Senkowsky, although a Russian by residence and by\r\nassociation, is not only, as I have already stated, of Polish birth, but\r\nis, moreover, one of the most popular writers in his native language.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur notice of Bohemian linguists must be even more meagre.\r\n\r\nThe early period of Bohemian letters presents no distinguished name. From\r\nthe extraordinary activity which the Bohemians exhibited in translating\r\nthe Bible in the fifteenth century, it might be supposed that the study\r\nof Greek and Hebrew had already taken root in the schools of Prague. But\r\nout of the “thirty-three copies in Bohemian of the entire Bible, and\r\ntwenty-two of the New Testament,”[232] which are still extant, translated\r\nduring that period, not one was rendered from the original languages.\r\nBlakoslav, the first translator of the Bible from Greek (in 1563) is\r\nsaid to have been a man of “profound erudition.” The same is said of\r\nGeorge Strye a few years later; and the Jesuits Konstanj, Steyer, and\r\nDrachovsky, are also entitled to notice.\r\n\r\nJohn Amos Komnensky, also, better known by his Latinized name, Comenius,\r\na native of Komna in Moravia, (1592-1671) deserved well of linguistic\r\nscience, not only by his own acquirements, but by his well-known work,\r\nthe _Janua Linguarum Reserata_, which has had the rare fortune of being\r\ntranslated not only into twelve European languages, but into those of\r\nseveral Oriental nations besides. The _Janua Linguarum_, however, though\r\nit attracted much attention at the time, has long been forgotten.\r\n\r\nIt would be still more unpardonable to overlook the celebrated\r\nphilologer, Father Joseph Dobrowsky, who, although born in Raab, in\r\nHungary, was of a Bohemian family, and devoted himself especially to\r\nthe literature and language of his nation. He had just entered the\r\nJesuit society at Brunn at the moment of the suppression of the order.\r\nRepairing to Prague, he applied himself for a time to the study of the\r\nOriental languages, but eventually concentrated all his energies on the\r\nhistory and language of Bohemia. His works upon Bohemian history and\r\nantiquities fill many volumes; and his Slavonic Grammar may be regarded\r\nas a classical work, not only in reference to his native language, but\r\nto the whole Slavonian family. Father Dobrowsky survived till the year\r\n1829, engaged until the very time of his death in active projects for the\r\ncultivation of the language and literature of the country of his adoption.\r\n\r\nBut probably the most remarkable name among Bohemian linguists is\r\nthat of Father Dobrowsky’s friend, the poet Wenceslaus Hanka, born at\r\nHoreneyes in 1791. Hanka’s love of languages was first stirred while he\r\nwas tending sheep near his native village, by the opportunity which he\r\nhad of learning Polish and Servian from some soldiers of these races\r\nbeing quartered upon his father’s farm. When he grew somewhat older, his\r\nparents, in order to save him from the chances of military conscription,\r\n(from which, in Bohemia, scholars are exempted) sent him to school;\r\nand he afterwards entered the University of Prague, and subsequently\r\nthat of Vienna. On the foundation of the Bohemian Museum at Prague,\r\nhe was appointed its librarian, through the recommendation of Father\r\nDobrowsky; and from that time he devoted himself almost entirely to the\r\nantiquities, literature, and language of his native country. Besides\r\nhis own original compositions, Hanka’s name has obtained considerable\r\ncelebrity in connexion with the controversy about the genuineness of the\r\nearly Bohemian poems known under the title of “Kralodvor,”—a controversy\r\nwhich, although it has ended differently, was for a time hardly less\r\nanimated than those regarding the Ossian and Rowley MSS. in England.\r\nNotwithstanding the variety of Hanka’s pursuits, and his especial\r\ndevotion to his own language, his acquisitions in languages have been\r\nmost various and extensive. He is described in the “Oesterreichische\r\nNational Encyclopædie” as “master of eighteen languages.”[233]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the Slavonic race our Catalogue of Linguists closes. Many\r\nparticulars regarding the eminent names which it comprises are, of\r\nnecessity, left vague and undetermined. I should have especially\r\ndesired to distinguish, in all cases, between mere book knowledge of\r\nlanguages and the power of writing, or still more of speaking, them. But\r\nunfortunately the accounts which are preserved regarding these scholars\r\nhardly ever enter into this distinction. Even Sir William Jones, though\r\nhe carefully classified the languages which he knew, did not specify\r\nthis particular; and in most other instances, the narrative, far from\r\nparticularizing, like that of Jones, the extent of the individual’s\r\nacquaintance with each language, even leaves in uncertainty the number of\r\nlanguages with which he was acquainted in any degree.\r\n\r\nThe very distribution, too, which I have found it expedient to\r\nfollow—according to nations—has had many disadvantages. But it seemed\r\nto be upon the whole the most convenient that could be devised. A\r\ndistribution into periods, besides that it would have been difficult to\r\nfollow out upon any clear and intelligible principle, would have been\r\nattended with the same disadvantages which characterize that according\r\nto nations; while the more strictly philosophical distribution according\r\nto ethnographical or philological schools, would have in great measure\r\nfailed to illustrate the object which I have chiefly had in view.\r\nSeveral of the most eminent of the modern ethnographical writers, and\r\nparticularly Pritchard, disavow all claim to the character of linguists;\r\nand the qualifications of many even of those whose pretensions seem the\r\nhighest, have, when submitted to a rigid examination, proved far more\r\nthan problematical.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are many curious details, however, into which, if space permitted,\r\nit would be interesting to pursue this inquiry.\r\n\r\nIt might seem natural, for instance, to investigate the nature and\r\nextent of the Miraculous Gift of Languages—the γένη γλωσσῶν of St.\r\nPaul—whether that possessed by the Apostles and other early teachers of\r\nChristianity, or that ascribed in later times to the missionaries among\r\nthe Heathen, and especially to the great Apostle of India, St. Francis\r\nXavier. Materials are not wanting for such an investigation;[234] but as\r\nit can hardly be said to bear upon the subject of this Biography, I have\r\nreluctantly passed it by.\r\n\r\nThe history of Royal Linguists, too, might afford much amusing material\r\nfor speculation. Mithridates, King of Pontus, as we have seen, spoke\r\ntwenty-two languages. Cleopatra was mistress, not only of seven\r\nlanguages enumerated by Plutarch, but, if we may believe his testimony,\r\nof most other known languages of the time. The accomplished, but\r\nill-fated, Queen of Palmyra, Zenobia, was familiar with Greek, Latin,\r\nSyriac, and Egyptian; and it may be presumed from the notion which\r\nprevailed among some Christian writers of her being a Jewess, that she\r\nwas also acquainted with Hebrew or its kindred tongues.[235] Most of the\r\nRoman Emperors were able indifferently to speak Greek or Latin.\r\n\r\nThe mediæval sovereigns, with the exception of Frederic II., referred\r\nto in a former page,[236] and the great and learned Pope Sylvester II.,\r\nbetter known by his family name Gerbert,[237] share, as linguists, the\r\ncommon mediocrity of the age. The learned Princess Anna Comnena does not\r\nappear at all distinguished in this particular; Charlemagne’s reputation\r\nrests on his acquaintance with Latin, and perhaps also Greek; and our own\r\nAlfred was regarded as a notable example of success, although there is no\r\nevidence that his linguistic attainments extended beyond a knowledge of\r\nLatin.\r\n\r\nVery early, however, after the revival of letters, Matthias Corvinus, the\r\nlearned and munificent King of Hungary, attained a rank as a linguist\r\nnot unworthy of a later day. Besides the learned languages, he was also\r\nacquainted with most of the living tongues of Europe. Charles V. knew and\r\nspoke five languages.[238] Henry VIII. spoke four. Several of the Roman\r\nPontiffs, particularly Paul IV., in other respects also a most remarkable\r\nscholar,[239] and the great Benedict XIV., were learned Orientalists,\r\nas well as good general linguists. The house of Stuart was eminent for\r\nthe gift of tongues. The ill-fated Mary of Scotland spoke most of the\r\nEuropean languages. James I., her son, with all his silly pedantry, was\r\nby no means a contemptible linguist. His grandson, Charles II., spoke\r\nFrench and Spanish fluently; and his brilliant grand-daughter, Elizabeth\r\nof Bavaria, who alone, according to Descartes, of all her contemporaries,\r\nwas able to understand the Cartesian philosophy, was mistress, besides\r\nmany scientific and literary accomplishments, of no fewer than six\r\nlanguages.[240] Christina of Sweden surpassed her in one particular.\r\nShe knew as many as eight languages, the major part of which she spoke\r\nfluently.\r\n\r\nNor are the courts of our own day without examples of the same\r\nacquirement. The late Emperor of Russia spoke five languages. Several of\r\nthe reigning sovereigns of Europe, Queen Victoria, Alexander of Russia,\r\nand Napoleon III. among the number, enjoy the reputation of excellent\r\nlinguists. The young Emperor of Austria is an accomplished classical\r\nscholar, and a perfect master of French, and of all the languages of\r\nhis own vast empire—German, Italian, Hungarian, Czechish, and Servian!\r\nPrince Lewis Lucian Bonaparte is a distinguished philologer, as well as a\r\nskilful linguist. His “Polyglot Parable of the Sower” is an interesting\r\ncontribution to the former science. Even the remote kingdom of Siam\r\nfurnishes, in its two Royal brothers, the First and the Second King,\r\nan example more deserving of praise than would be a far higher success\r\nin a more favoured land. The First King, Somdetch Phra Paramendt Maha\r\nMongkut,[241] has evinced a degree of intellectual activity, rare\r\nindeed among the potentates of the East. Besides the ancient language\r\nand literature of his own kingdom, and all its modern dialects and\r\nsub-divisions, he knows Sanscrit, Cingalese, and Peguan. From the\r\nCatholic missionaries, especially Bishop Pallegoix, he has learned Latin\r\nand also Greek, and from the American Baptists, English. His letters,\r\nthough sometimes unidiomatical, are highly characteristic, and display\r\nmuch intelligence and ability. He is also well versed in European\r\nsciences, especially astronomy and mechanics. He has formed, moreover, a\r\nvery considerable collection of astronomical and philosophical apparatus;\r\nhas established printing and lithographic presses in the palace; and has\r\nimported steam machinery of various kinds from America. It is gratifying\r\nto add that his brother, the Second King, shares all his tastes, and is\r\ntreading worthily in his footsteps.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA still more attractive topic would be the long line of Lady-Linguists.\r\n\r\nIt is not a little remarkable that, among the sovereigns who have\r\ndistinguished themselves as linguists, the proportion of queens is very\r\nconsiderable. The three names, Cleopatra, Zenobia, and Christina of\r\nSweden, unquestionably represent a larger aggregate of languages than any\r\nthree of the king-linguists, if we exclude Mithridates.\r\n\r\nNor are the humbler lady-linguists unworthy this companionship. The nun\r\nRoswitha, of Gandesheim, still favourably known by her sacred Latin\r\npoetry, was also acquainted with Greek—a rare accomplishment in the tenth\r\ncentury. Tarquinia Molza, grand-daughter of the gifted, but licentious\r\npoet of the same name, knew Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, as well as the\r\nordinary modern languages. Elena Cornaro Piscopia knew Italian, Spanish,\r\nFrench, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and even Arabic.[242] Nay, strange as it\r\nmay seem in modern eyes, the university of Bologna numbers several ladies\r\namong the occupants of its pulpits. The beautiful Novella d’Andrea,\r\ndaughter of the great jurist, Giovanni d’Andrea, professor of law in the\r\nUniversity of Bologna in the 15th century, was wont to take her father’s\r\nplace as lecturer on law; observing, however, the precaution of using\r\na veil, lest her beauty should distract the attention of her pupils.\r\nHer mother Milancia, scarcely less learned, was habitually consulted by\r\nGiovanni on all questions of special difficulty which arose.[243] Laura\r\nBassi held the chair of philosophy in more modern times.[244] Clotilda\r\nTambroni, the last and not the least distinguished of the lady professors\r\nof Bologna, has, besides her literary glories, the honour of having\r\nsuffered in the cause of loyalty and religion. Like her friend and fellow\r\nprofessor, Mezzofanti, she refused, on the occupation of Bologna by the\r\nFrench, to take the oaths of the new government, and was deprived of the\r\nprofessorship of Greek in consequence.\r\n\r\nThe learned ladies of Bologna are not alone among their countrywomen.\r\nThe celebrated Dominican nun, Cassandra Fedele of Venice; Alessandra\r\nScala of Florence; and Olympia Fulvia Morata of Ferrara, are all equally\r\ndistinguished as proficients in at least two learned languages, Latin and\r\nGreek. Margherita Gaetana Agnesi, of Milan, was familiar with Latin at\r\nnine years of age; and, while still extremely young, mastered Greek and\r\nHebrew, together with French, Spanish, and German. In the very meridian\r\nof her fame, nevertheless, she renounced the brilliant career which lay\r\nopen to her, in order to devote herself to God as a Sister of Charity.\r\nAnother fair Italian, Modesta Pozzo, born at Venice in 1555, deserves to\r\nbe mentioned, although she is better known for her extraordinary powers\r\nof memory, than her skill in languages.[245] She was able to repeat the\r\nlongest sermon after hearing it but once.\r\n\r\nNor are we without examples, although perhaps not so numerous, in other\r\ncountries. Many Spanish and Portuguese ladies learned in languages, are\r\nenumerated by Nicholas de Antonio.[246] Dona Anna de Villegas, and D.\r\nCecilia di Arellano, besides being excellent Latinists, were mistresses\r\nof French, Italian, and Portuguese.[247] To these languages D. Cecilia\r\nde Morellas added Greek as one of her accomplishments,[248] and D.\r\nJuliana de Morell, a nun of the Dominican order in the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century, in addition to these languages, was not only a\r\nlearned Hebraist, but an acute and skilful disputant in the philosophy of\r\nthe schools.[249]\r\n\r\nThe accomplished Anna Maria Schurmann, of whom Cologne is still justly\r\nproud, in addition to her numerous gifts in painting, sculpture, music,\r\nand poetry, was mistress of eight languages, among which were Latin,\r\nGreek, Hebrew, and Ethiopic.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant, but eccentric Russian Princess Dashkoff, holds a still\r\nmore prominent place in the world of letters. The early friend and\r\nconfidant of the Empress Catherine, and (with a few alternations\r\nof disfavour,) the sharer of most of the literary projects of that\r\nextraordinary woman, the Princess Dashkoff had the (for a lady rare)\r\nhonour of holding the place of President of the Russian Academy. When\r\nthe Dictionary of the Academy was projected, she actually undertook, in\r\nher own person, three letters of the work, together with the general\r\nsuperintendence of the entire! The princess was not unfamiliar with the\r\nlearned languages, some of which she not only spoke but wrote: but her\r\nchief attainments were in those of modern Europe. Her autobiographical\r\nMemoirs appear to have been written in French; and the English letters\r\nembodied in the work prove her to have possessed a thorough knowledge of\r\nthat language also.\r\n\r\nSome of our own countrywomen, if less showy, may perhaps advance a more\r\nsolid title to distinction. The beautiful Mrs. Carter, translator of\r\nEpictetus, well deserves to be mentioned; and the amiable and singularly\r\ngifted Elizabeth Smith, is a not unmeet consort for the most eminent\r\nlinguists of any age. “With scarcely any assistance,” writes her\r\nbiographer, Mrs. Bowdler, to Dr. Mummsen,[250] “she taught herself the\r\nFrench, Italian, Greek, Latin, Spanish, German, and Hebrew languages. She\r\nhad no inconsiderable knowledge of Arabic and Persian.” Her translation\r\nof the Book of Job is a permanent evidence that her knowledge of Hebrew\r\nwas of no ordinary kind.\r\n\r\nEven the New World has supplied some names to this interesting catalogue.\r\nThe Mexican poetess, Juana Inez de la Cruz, better known as the “Nun of\r\nMexico,” (1651-95), a marvel of precocious knowledge, learned Latin in\r\ntwenty lessons, when a mere girl; and quickly became such a proficient\r\nas to speak it with ease and fluency. Her acquisitions in general\r\nlearning were most various and extensive; and when on one occasion, in\r\nher seventeenth year, forty learned men of Mexico were invited to dispute\r\nwith her, she proved a match for each in his own particular department.\r\nAll these accomplishments, notwithstanding, she had the humility to bury\r\nin the obscurity of a convent in Mexico, where she silently devoted\r\nherself for twenty-seven years to literature and religion. She died\r\nin 1695, leaving behind many works still regarded as classics in the\r\nlanguage, which fill no less than three 4to. volumes, and have passed\r\nthrough twelve successive editions in Spain. All, with the exception of\r\ntwo, are on sacred subjects.[251]\r\n\r\n“Infant Phenomena” of language would supply another curious and fertile\r\ntopic for inquiry—an inquiry too in a psychological point of view\r\neminently interesting.\r\n\r\nMany of the great linguists enumerated in this Memoir, Pico of Mirandola,\r\nCrichton, Martin del Rio, and several others, owed part of their\r\ncelebrity to the marvellous precociousness of their gifts. A far larger\r\nproportion, however, of those who prematurely displayed this talent, were\r\ncut off before it had attained any mature or healthy development.\r\n\r\nCancellieri[252] mentions a child named Jacopo Martino,[253] born at\r\nRacuno, in the Venetian territory, in 1639, who not only acquired a\r\nknowledge of Greek and Hebrew, between the age of three and seven, but\r\nmade such progress in philosophical science as successfully to maintain\r\na public thesis in philosophy at Rome, when no more than eight years of\r\nage.[254] This extraordinary child, however, died of exhaustion in 1649,\r\nbefore he had completed his ninth year.\r\n\r\nIt was the same for Claudio del Valle y Hernandez, a Spanish prodigy,\r\nmentioned by the same author.\r\n\r\nBut probably the most extraordinary examples of this psychological\r\nphenomenon upon record, occur, by a curious coincidence, almost at the\r\nvery same date in the commencement of the eighteenth century. Within\r\nthe three years, from 1719 to 1721, were born in different countries,\r\nthree children of a precociousness (even though we accept the traditions\r\nregarding them with great deductions,) entirely without parallel in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe first of these, John Lewis Candiac, was born at Nismes, in 1719.\r\nThis strangely gifted child, we are told, was able, in his third\r\nyear, to speak not only his native French but also Latin. Before he\r\nwas six years old he spoke also Greek and Hebrew. He was well versed,\r\nbesides, in arithmetic, geography, ancient and modern history, and even\r\nheraldry.[255] But, as might be expected, these premature efforts quickly\r\nexhausted his overtaxed powers, and he died of water on the brain in\r\n1726, at seven years of age.\r\n\r\nChristian Henry Heinecken, a child of equal promise, was cut off even\r\nmore prematurely. He was born at Lubeck in 1721. He is said to have been\r\nable to speak at ten months old. By the time he attained his twelfth\r\nmonth, he had learned, if his biographers can be credited, all the facts\r\nin the history of the Pentateuch.[256] In another month he added to this\r\nall the rest of the history of the old Testament; and, when he was but\r\nfourteen months old, he was master of all the leading facts of the Bible!\r\nAt two and a half years of age, he spoke fluently, besides his native\r\nGerman, the French and Latin languages. In this year he was presented at\r\nthe Danish court, where he excited universal astonishment. But, on his\r\nreturn home, he fell sick and died in his fourth year.\r\n\r\nThe third of these marvels of precocity, John Philip Baratier, who is\r\nprobably known to many readers by Johnson’s interesting memoir,[257]\r\nwas born at Anspach in the same year with Heinecken, 1721. His career,\r\nhowever, was not so brief, nor were its fruits so ephemeral, as those\r\nof the ill-fated children just named. When Baratier was only four years\r\nold, he was able to speak Latin, French, and German. At six he spoke\r\nGreek; and at nine Hebrew; in which latter language the soundness of his\r\nattainments is attested by a lexicon which he published in his eleventh\r\nyear. Nor was Baratier a mere linguist. He is said to have mastered\r\nelementary mathematics in three months, and to have qualified himself by\r\nthirteen month’s study for the ordinary thesis maintained at taking out\r\nthe degree of Doctor of Laws. He was also well versed in architecture,\r\nin ancient and modern literature, in antiquities, and even the uncommon\r\nscience of numismatics. He translated from the Hebrew Benjamin of\r\nTudela’s “Itinerary.” He published a detailed and critical account of the\r\nRabbinical Bible; and communicated to several societies elaborate papers\r\non astronomical and mathematical subjects. This extraordinary youth died\r\nat the age of nineteen in 1760.\r\n\r\nLater[258] in the same century was born at Rome a child named\r\nGiovanni Cristoforo Amaduzzi,[259] if not quite so precocious as this\r\nextraordinary trio, at least of riper intellect, and destined to survive\r\nfor greater distinction and for a more useful career. The precise dates\r\nof his various attainments do not appear to be chronicled; but, when he\r\nwas only twelve years old, he published a poetical translation of the\r\nHecuba of Euripides, which excited universal surprise; and a few years\r\nlater, on the visit of the Emperor Joseph II. and his brother Leopold to\r\nRome, he addressed to the Emperor a polyglot ode of welcome in Greek,\r\nLatin, Italian, and French. His after studies, however, were more serious\r\nand more practical. He is well-known, not only as a linguist, but also\r\nas a philologer of some merit; and in his capacity of corrector of the\r\nPropaganda Oriental Press, a post which he filled till his death, in\r\n1792, he rendered many important services to Oriental studies.[260]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting too, and not without its advantage in reference\r\nto the history of the human mind, to collect examples of what may be\r\ncalled Uneducated Linguists; of Dragomans, Couriers, “Lohnbedienter,”\r\nand others[261], who, ignorant of all else besides, have acquired a\r\nfacility almost marvellous of speaking several languages fluently, and in\r\nmany cases with sufficient, seeming accuracy.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is the place to mention the once notorious (to use his own\r\nfavourite designation) “Odcombian Leg-stretcher,” Tom Coryat, a native\r\nof Odcombe in Somersetshire (1577-1617), and author of the now rare\r\nvolume, “Coryat’s Crudities.”[262] Coryat may fairly be described as\r\n“an uneducated linguist;” for, although he passed through Westminster\r\nSchool, and afterwards entered Gloucester Hall, Oxford, the languages\r\nwhich he learned were all picked up, without regular study, during his\r\nlong pedestrian wanderings in every part of the world; one of which, of\r\nnearly two thousand miles, he accomplished in a single pair of shoes,\r\n(which he hung up in the church of Odcombe as a votive offering on his\r\nreturn), and another, of no less than two thousand seven hundred, at a\r\ncost of about three pounds sterling! This strange genius acquired, in a\r\nsufficient degree for all the wants of conversation, Italian, Turkish,\r\nArabic, Persian, and Hindustani!\r\n\r\nAnother singularity of the same kind was Robert Hill, the Jewish tailor,\r\nwhom Spence has made the subject of an exceedingly curious parallel with\r\nMagliabecchi.[263] And many similar examples might doubtless be collected\r\namong the couriers, interpreters, and valets-de-place of most of the\r\nEuropean capitals. Baron von Zach mentions an ordinary valet-de-place who\r\ncould speak nearly all the European languages with the greatest ease and\r\ncorrectness, although he was utterly ignorant not only of the grammar of\r\nevery one of them, but even of that of his own language. I have already\r\nsaid that the same species of talent is hereditary in several families in\r\ndifferent ports and cities of the Levant.\r\n\r\nThe history of such cases as these, if it were possible to investigate\r\nit accurately, might throw light on the operations of the mind in the\r\nacquisition of languages. These, however, and many similar topics,\r\ninteresting and curious as they are for their own sake, have but little\r\nbearing on the present inquiry; the purpose of which is simply to prepare\r\nthe way for a fitting estimate of the attainments of the illustrious\r\nsubject of the following Biography, by placing in contrast with them the\r\ngifts of others who, at various times, have risen to eminence in the same\r\ndepartment. Cardinal Mezzofanti will be found to stand so immeasurably\r\nabove even the highest of these names, in the department of language,\r\nthat, at least for the purposes of comparison with him, its minor\r\ncelebrities can possess little claim for consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF CARDINAL MEZZOFANTI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n[1774-1798.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA Memoir of Cardinal Mezzofanti can be little more than a philological\r\nessay. Quiet and uneventful as was his career, its history possesses few\r\nof the ordinary attractions of Biography. The main interest of such a\r\nnarrative must consist in the light which it may tend to throw on the\r\ncurious problem;—what degree of perfection the human mind, concentrating\r\nits powers upon one department of knowledge, is capable of attaining\r\ntherein; and the highest hope of the author is to escape the reproach\r\nwhich Warburton directed against Boileau’s biographer, Desmaiseaux, of\r\nhaving “written a book without a life.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJoseph Caspar Mezzofanti,[264] was born at Bologna,[265] on the 17th\r\nof September, 1774.[266] His father, Francis Mezzofanti, a native\r\nof the same city, was of very humble extraction, and by trade a\r\ncarpenter. Though almost entirely uneducated,[267] Francis Mezzofanti\r\nis described by the few who remember him, as a man of much shrewdness\r\nand intelligence, a skilful mechanic, and universally respected for his\r\nintegrity, piety, and honourable principles. For Mezzofanti’s mother,\r\nGesualda Dall’ Olmo, a higher lineage has been claimed;—the name of Dall’\r\nOlmo[268] being extremely ancient and not undistinguished in the annals\r\nof Bologna; but the fortunes of the immediate branch of that family from\r\nwhich Gesualda Dall’ Olmo sprung, were no less humble than those of her\r\nhusband. Her education, however, was somewhat superior; and with much\r\nsimplicity and sweetness of disposition, she united excellent talents,\r\ngreat prudence and good sense, and a profoundly religious mind.\r\n\r\nOf this marriage were born several children; but they all died at an\r\nearly age, except a daughter named Teresa, and Joseph Caspar, the\r\nsubject of the present biography. Teresa was the senior by ten years,\r\nand, while her brother was yet a boy, married a young man named Joseph\r\nLewis Minarelli,[269] by trade a hair dresser, to whom she bore a very\r\nnumerous family,[270] several of whom still survive. To the kind courtesy\r\nof one of these, the Cavaliere Pietro Minarelli, I am indebted for a\r\nfew particulars of the family history, and of the early years of his\r\nvenerated uncle.[271]\r\n\r\nIt may be supposed that in the case of Mezzofanti, as in those of most\r\nmen who attain to eminence in life, there are not wanting marvellous\r\ntales of his youthful studies, and anecdotes of the first indications of\r\nthe extraordinary gift by which his later years were distinguished.\r\n\r\nAccording to one of these accounts, his first years were entirely\r\nneglected, and he was placed, while yet a mere child, in the workshop of\r\nhis father, to learn the trade of a carpenter. As is usual in the towns\r\nof Italy, the elder Mezzofanti, for the most part, plied his craft not\r\nwithin doors, but in the open street: and it chanced that the bench at\r\nwhich the boy was wont to work was situated directly opposite the window\r\nof a school kept by an old priest, who instructed a number of pupils in\r\nLatin and Greek. Although utterly unacquainted, not only with the Greek\r\nalphabet, but even with that of his own language, young Mezzofanti,\r\noverhearing the lessons which were taught in the school, caught up every\r\nGreek and Latin word that was explained in the several classes, without\r\nonce having seen a Greek or Latin book! By some lucky accident the fact\r\ncame to the knowledge of his unwitting instructor: it led of course to\r\nthe withdrawal of the youth from the mechanical craft to which his father\r\nhad destined him, and rescued him for the more congenial pursuit of\r\nliterature.[272]\r\n\r\nA still more marvellous tale is told by a popular American writer, Mr.\r\nHeadley, whom his transatlantic admirers have styled the “Addison of\r\nAmerica;” that while Mezzofanti “was still an obscure priest in the north\r\nof Italy, he was called one day to confess two foreigners condemned for\r\npiracy, who were to be executed next day. On entering their cell, he\r\nfound them unable to understand a word he uttered. Overwhelmed with the\r\nthought that the criminals should leave the world without the benefits\r\nof religion, he returned to his room, resolved to acquire the language\r\nbefore morning. He accomplished his task, and next day confessed them in\r\ntheir own tongue! From that time on, he had no trouble in mastering the\r\nmost difficult language. The purity of his motive in the first instance,\r\nhe thought, influenced the Deity to assist him miraculously.”[273] This\r\nstrange tale Mr. Headley relates, on the authority of a priest, a friend\r\nof Mezzofanti; and he goes so far as to say, that “Mezzofanti himself\r\nattributed his power of acquiring languages to the divine influence.”[274]\r\n\r\nThe imagination might dwell with pleasure upon these and similar tales\r\nof wonder; but, happily for the moral lesson which it is the best\r\nprivilege of biography to convey, the true history of the early studies\r\nof Mezzofanti, (although while falling far short of these marvels, it is\r\ntoo wonderful to be held out as a model even for the most aspiring) is,\r\nnevertheless, such as to show that the most gifted themselves can only\r\nhope to attain to true eminence by patient and systematic industry.\r\n\r\nFar from being entirely neglected, as these tales would imply,\r\nMezzofanti’s education commenced at an unusually early period. His\r\nparents—\r\n\r\n    A virtuous household, but exceeding poor,\r\n\r\nconscious of their own want of learning, appear, from the very first, to\r\nhave bestowed upon the education of their son all the care which their\r\nnarrow circumstances permitted. According to an account obtained from\r\nthe Cavaliere Minarelli, he was sent, while a mere child, not yet three\r\nyears old, to a dame’s school, more, it would seem, for security, than\r\nfor actual instruction. Being deemed too young to be regularly taught,\r\nhe was here left for a time to sit in quiet and amuse himself as best\r\nhe could, while the other children were receiving instruction; but the\r\nmistress soon discovered that the child, although excluded from the\r\nlessons of his elders, had learned without any effort, all that had been\r\ncommunicated to them, and was able to repeat promptly and accurately\r\nthe tasks which she had dictated. He was accordingly admitted to the\r\nregular classes; and, child as he was, passed rapidly through the various\r\nelementary branches of instruction, to which alone her humble school\r\nextended.\r\n\r\nFrom this dame’s school he was removed to the more advanced, but still\r\nelementary, school of the Abate Filippo Cicotti, in which he learned\r\ngrammar, geography, writing, arithmetic, algebra, and the elements\r\nof Latin. But, after some time, the excellent priest who conducted\r\nthis school, honestly advised the parents, young as was their boy, to\r\nremove him to another institution, and to permit him to apply himself\r\nunrestrainedly to the higher studies for which he was already fully\r\nqualified.\r\n\r\nHis father appears to have demurred for a while to this suggestion.\r\nLimiting his views in reference to the boy to the lowly sphere in which\r\nhe himself had been born, he had only contemplated bestowing upon him a\r\nsolid elementary education in the branches of knowledge suited to its\r\nhumble requirements; and, with the old-fashioned prejudices not uncommon\r\nin his rank, he was unwilling to sanction his son’s entering upon what\r\nappeared to him an unnatural and unprofitable career, for one who was\r\ndestined to earn his bread by a mechanical art. Fortunately, however, his\r\nwife entertained higher and more enlightened views for their child, and\r\nunderstood better his character and capabilities.\r\n\r\nIt was mainly, however, through the counsel and influence of a benevolent\r\npriest of the Oratory, Father John Baptist Respighi, that the career\r\nof the young Mezzofanti was decided. This excellent clergyman, to whom\r\nmany deserving youths of his native city were indebted for assistance\r\nand patronage in their entrance into life, observed the rare talents of\r\nMezzofanti, and, by his earnest advice, promptly overruled the hesitation\r\nof his father. At his recommendation, the boy was transferred from the\r\nschool of the Abate Cicotti, to one of the so-called “Scuole Pie,” of\r\nBologna;—schools conducted by a religious congregation, which had been\r\nfounded in the beginning of the seventeenth century, by Joseph Cazalana;\r\nand which, though originally intended chiefly for the more elementary\r\nbranches of education, had also been directed with great success,\r\n(especially in the larger cities,) to the cultivation of the higher\r\nstudies.\r\n\r\nAmong the clergymen who at this period devoted themselves to the service\r\nof the Scuole Pie, at Bologna, were several members of the recently\r\nsuppressed society of the Jesuits, not only of the Roman, but also of\r\nthe Spanish and Spanish American provinces. The expulsion of the society\r\nfrom Spain had preceded by more than three years the general suppression\r\nof the order; and the Spanish members of the brotherhood, when exiled\r\nfrom their native country, had found a cordial welcome in the Papal\r\nstates. Among these were several who were either foreigners by birth, or\r\nhad long resided in the foreign missions of the society. To them all the\r\nScuole Pie seemed to open a field of labour almost identical with that\r\nof their own institute. Many of them gladly embraced the opportunity;\r\nand it can hardly be doubted that the facility of learning a variety\r\nof languages, which this accidental union of instructors from so many\r\ndifferent countries afforded, was, after his own natural bias, among\r\nthe chief circumstances which determined the direction of the youthful\r\nstudies of Mezzofanti.\r\n\r\nOne of these ex-Jesuits, Father Emanuel Aponte, a native of Spain, had\r\nbeen for many years a member of the mission of the Philippine Islands.\r\nAnother, Father Mark Escobar, was a native of Guatemala, and had been\r\nemployed in several of the Mexican and South American missions of the\r\nsociety. A third, Father Laurence Ignatius Thiulen, had passed through a\r\nstill more remarkable career. He was a native of Gottenburg, in Sweden,\r\nwhere his father held the office of superintendent of the Swedish East\r\nIndia Company, and had been born (1746,) a Lutheran. Leaving home in\r\nearly youth with the design of improving himself by foreign travel, he\r\nspent some time in Lisbon, and afterwards in Cadiz, in 1768; whence,\r\nwith the intention of proceeding to Italy, he embarked for the island of\r\nCorsica, in the same ship in which he had reached Lisbon from his native\r\ncountry. In the meantime, however, this ship had been chartered by the\r\ngovernment as one of the fleet in which the Jesuit Fathers, on their\r\nsudden and mysterious suppression in Spain, were to be transported to\r\nItaly. By this unexpected accident, Thiulen became the fellow passenger\r\nof several of the exiled fathers. Trained from early youth to regard\r\nwith suspicion and fear every member of that dreaded order, he at first\r\navoided all intercourse with his Jesuit fellow passengers. By degrees,\r\nhowever, their unobtrusive, but ready courtesy, disarmed his suspicions.\r\nHe became interested in their conversation, even when it occasionally\r\nturned upon religious topics. Serious inquiry succeeded; and in the end,\r\nbefore the voyage was concluded, his prejudices had been so far overcome,\r\nthat he began to entertain the design of becoming a Catholic. After his\r\nlanding in the Island of Corsica, many obstacles were thrown in his\r\nway by the Swedish consul at Bastia, himself a Lutheran; but Thiulen\r\npersevered, and was enabled eventually to carry his design into execution\r\nat Ferrara, in 1769. In the following year, 1770, he entered the Jesuit\r\nsociety at Bologna. He was here admitted to the simple vow in 1772. But\r\nhe had hardly completed this important step, when the final suppression\r\nof the Order was proclaimed; and, although both as a foreigner, and as\r\nbeing unprofessed, he had no claim to the slender pittance which was\r\nassigned for the support of the members, the peculiar circumstances of\r\nhis case created an interest in his behalf. He was placed upon the same\r\nfooting with the professed Fathers; and two years later, in 1776, he was\r\npromoted to the holy order of priesthood, and continued to reside in\r\nBologna, engaged in teaching and in the duties of the ministry.[275]\r\n\r\nThese good Fathers, with that traditionary instinct which in their order\r\nhas been the secret of their long admitted success in the education of\r\nyouth, were not slow to discover the rare talents of their young scholar\r\nin the Scuole Pie. In a short time he appears to have become to them more\r\na friend than a pupil. Two, at least, of the members, Fathers Aponte, and\r\nThiulen, lived to witness the distinction of his later life, and with\r\nthem, as well as with his first and kindest patron, Father Respighi,\r\nhe ever continued to maintain the most friendly and affectionate\r\nrelations.[276]\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to be able to trace the exact history of this\r\nperiod of the studies of Mezzofanti, and to fix the dates and the\r\norder of his successive acquisitions in what afterwards became the\r\nengrossing pursuit of his life. But, unfortunately, so few details\r\ncan now be ascertained that it is difficult to distinguish his school\r\nlife from that of an ordinary student. His chief teachers in the Scuole\r\nPie appear to have been the ex-Jesuit Fathers already named; of whom\r\nFather Thiulen was his instructor in history, geography, arithmetic, and\r\nmathematics;[277] Father Aponte in Greek; and probably Father Escobar\r\nin Latin. As he certainly learned Spanish at an early period, it is not\r\nunlikely that he was indebted for it, too, to the instructions of one of\r\nthese ecclesiastics, as also perhaps for some knowledge of the Mexican or\r\nCentral American languages.\r\n\r\nBut although barren in details, all the accounts of his school-days\r\nconcur in describing his uniform success in all his classes, and the\r\nextraordinary quickness of his memory. One of his feats of memory is\r\nrecorded by M. Manavit.[278] A folio volume of the works of St. John\r\nChrysostom being put into his hand, he was desired to read a page of\r\nthe treatise “_De Sacerdotio_” in the original Greek. After a single\r\nreading, the volume was closed, and he repeated the entire page, without\r\nmistaking or displacing a single word! His manners and dispositions as\r\na boy were exceedingly engaging; and the friendships which he formed at\r\nschool continued uninterrupted during life. Among his school companions\r\nthere is one who deserves to be especially recorded—the well-known\r\nnaturalist, Abate Camillo Ranzani, for many years afterwards Mezzofanti’s\r\nfellow-professor in the university. Ranzani, like his friend, was of\r\nvery humble origin, and like him owed his withdrawal from obscurity to\r\nthe enlightened benevolence of the good Oratorian, F. Respighi.[279]\r\nYoung Ranzani was about the same age with Mezzofanti; and as their homes\r\nimmediately adjoined each other,[280] they had been daily companions\r\nalmost from infancy, and particularly from the time when they began to\r\nfrequent the Scuole Pie in company. The constant allusions to Ranzani\r\nwhich occur in Mezzofanti’s letters, will show how close and affectionate\r\ntheir intimacy continued to be.\r\n\r\nJoseph Mezzofanti early manifested a desire to embrace the ecclesiastical\r\nprofession; and although this wish seems to have caused some\r\ndissatisfaction to his father, who had intended him for some secular\r\npursuit,[281] yet the deeply religious disposition of the child and his\r\nsingular innocence of life, in the end overcame his father’s reluctance.\r\nHaving completed his elementary studies unusually early, he was enabled\r\nto become a scholar of the archiepiscopal seminary of Bologna, while\r\nstill a mere boy, probably in the year 1786.[282] He continued, however,\r\nto reside in his father’s house, while he attended the schools of the\r\nseminary.\r\n\r\nOf his collegiate career little is recorded, except an incident which\r\noccurred at the taking of his degree in philosophy. His master in\r\nthis study was Joseph Voglio, a professor of considerable reputation,\r\nand author of several works on the philosophical controversies of the\r\nperiod.[283] It is usual in the Italian universities for the candidate\r\nfor a philosophical degree, to defend publicly a series of propositions\r\nselected from the whole body of philosophy. Mezzofanti, at the time that\r\nhe maintained his theses, was still little more than a child; and it\r\nwould seem that, his self-possession having given way under the public\r\nordeal, he had a narrow escape from the mortification of a complete\r\nfailure. One of the witnesses of his “Disputation,” Dr. Santagata,\r\nin the Discourse already referred to, delivered at the Institute of\r\nBologna, gives an interesting account of the occurrence. “For a time,”\r\nsays Dr. Santagata, “the boy’s success was most marked. Each new\r\nobjection, among the many subtle ones that were proposed, only afforded\r\nhim a fresh opportunity of exhibiting the acuteness of his intellect,\r\nand the ease, fluency, and elegance of his Latinity; and the admiring\r\nmurmurs of assent, and other unequivocal tokens of applause which it\r\nelicited from the audience, of which I myself was one, seemed to promise\r\na triumphant conclusion of the exercise. But all at once the young\r\ncandidate was observed to grow pale, to become suddenly silent, and at\r\nlength to fall back upon his seat and almost faint away. The auditors\r\nwere deeply grieved at this untoward interruption of a performance\r\nhitherto so successful; but they were soon relieved to see him, as if by\r\none powerful effort, shake off his emotion, recover his self-possession,\r\nand resume his answering with even greater acuteness and solidity than\r\nbefore. He was greeted with the loud and repeated plaudits of the crowded\r\nassembly.”[284]\r\n\r\nAbout this period, soon after Mezzofanti had completed his fifteenth\r\nyear, his health gave way under this long and intense application;\r\nand his constitution for a time was so debilitated, that, at the\r\ntermination of his course of philosophy, he was compelled to interrupt\r\nhis studies;[285] nor was it until about 1793, that he entered upon the\r\ntheological course, under the direction of the Canon Joachim Ambrosi.\r\nOne of his class-fellows, the Abate Monti, the venerable arch-priest of\r\nBagni di Poreta, in the archdiocese of Bologna, still survives and speaks\r\nin high terms of the ability which he exhibited. He describes him as a\r\nyouth of most engaging manners and amiable dispositions—one who, from\r\nhis habitually serious and recollected air, might perhaps be noted by\r\nstrangers\r\n\r\n    For his grave looks, too thoughtful for his years,\r\n\r\nbut who, to his friends, was all gaiety and innocent mirthfulness. Mgr.\r\nMonti adds that he was at this time a most laborious student, frequently\r\nremaining up whole nights in the library for the purpose of study. His\r\nmaster in moral theology was the Canonico Baccialli, author of a _Corpus\r\nTheologiæ Moralis_, of some local reputation.\r\n\r\nHaving completed the course of theology, and also that of canon law,\r\nhe attended the lectures of the celebrated Jurist, Bonini, on Roman\r\nLaw. The great body of the students of the school of Roman Law being\r\nlaymen, the young ecclesiastic remained a considerable time unobserved\r\nand undistinguished in the class; until, having accidentally attracted\r\nthe notice of the professor on one occasion, he replied with such\r\npromptness and learning to a question which he addressed to him, as\r\nat once to establish a reputation; and Dr. Santagata, who records the\r\ncircumstance,[286] observes that his proficiency in each of his many\r\ndifferent studies was almost as great as though he had devoted his\r\nundivided attention to that particular pursuit.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, he continued without interruption, what, even thus\r\nearly in his career, was his chosen study of languages. Under the\r\ndirection of Father Aponte, now rather his friend and associate than\r\ninstructor in the study, he pursued his Greek reading; and as this had\r\nbeen from the first one of his favourite languages, there were few Greek\r\nauthors within his reach that he did not eagerly read. Fortunately, too,\r\nAponte was himself an enthusiast in the study of Greek, and possessed a\r\nsolid and critical knowledge of the language, of which he had written\r\nan excellent and practical grammar for the schools of the university,\r\nfrequently republished since his time;[287] and it was probably to the\r\nhabit of close and critical examination which he acquired under Aponte’s\r\ninstruction, that Mezzofanti owed the exact knowledge of the niceties of\r\nthe language, and the power of discriminating between all the varieties\r\nof Greek style, for which, as we shall see later, he was eminently\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nOne of his fellow pupils in Greek under Aponte was the celebrated\r\nClotilda Tambroni, whom I have already mentioned in the list of\r\nlady-linguists, and whose name is the last in the catalogue of\r\nlady-professors at Bologna. A community of tastes as well as of studies\r\nformed a close bond of intimacy between her and Mezzofanti, and led to an\r\naffectionate and lasting friendship in after life. To Aponte she was as\r\na daughter.[288]\r\n\r\nHis master in Hebrew was the Dominican Father Ceruti, a learned\r\nOrientalist and professor of that language in the university. About the\r\nsame time also, he must have become acquainted with Arabic, a language\r\nfor the study of which Bologna had early acquired a reputation. And, what\r\nis a still more unequivocal exhibition of his early enthusiasm, although\r\nCoptic formed no part of the circle of university studies, Görres\r\nstates that he learned this language also under the Canon John Lewis\r\nMingarelli.[289] If this account be true, as Mingarelli died in March\r\n1793, Mezzofanti must have acquired Coptic before he had completed his\r\nnineteenth year.\r\n\r\nNor did he meanwhile neglect the modern languages. About the year 1792, a\r\nFrench ecclesiastic a native of Blois, one of those whom the successive\r\ndecrees of the Constituent Assembly had driven into exile, came to\r\nreside in Bologna. From him Mezzofanti speedily acquired French.[290] He\r\nreceived his first lessons in German from F. Thiulen,[291] who had been\r\none of his masters in the Scuole Pie; and who, although a Swede by birth,\r\nwas acquainted with the cognate language of Germany. From him, too,\r\nmost probably, Mezzofanti would also have learned his native Swedish,\r\nbut, on the occupation of northern Italy by the French, F. Thiulen, who\r\nhad made himself obnoxious to the revolutionary party in Bologna, by\r\nhis writings in favour of the Papal authority, had been arrested and\r\nsent into exile.[292] Perhaps Thiulen’s absence from Bologna was the\r\noccasion of calling into exercise that marvellous quickness in mastering\r\nthe structure of a new language, which often, during Mezzofanti’s later\r\ncareer, excited the amazement even of his most familiar friends. At\r\nall events, the first occasion of his exhibiting this singular faculty\r\nof which I have been able to discover any authentic record, is the\r\nfollowing:—\r\n\r\nA Bolognese musician, named Uttini, had settled at Stockholm, where\r\nhe married a Swedish lady. Uttini, it would seem, died early; but his\r\nbrother, Caspar Uttini, a physician of Bologna, undertook the education\r\nof his son, who was sent to Bologna for the purpose. The boy, at his\r\narrival, was not only entirely ignorant of Italian, but could not speak\r\na word of any language except his native Swedish. In this emergency\r\nMezzofanti, who, although still a student, had already acquired the\r\nreputation of a linguist, was sent for, to act as interpreter between the\r\nboy and his newly found relatives: but it turned out that the language\r\nof the boy was, as yet, no less a mystery to Mezzofanti than it had\r\nalready proved to themselves. This discovery, so embarrassing to the\r\nfamily, served but to stimulate the zeal of Mezzofanti. Having made a\r\nfew ineffectual attempts to establish an understanding, he asked to see\r\nthe books which the boy had brought with him from his native country. A\r\nshort examination of these books was sufficient for his rapid mind; he\r\nspeedily discovered the German affinities of the Swedish language, and\r\nmastered almost at a glance the leading peculiarities of form, structure,\r\nand inflexion, by which it is distinguished from the other members of the\r\nTeutonic family; a few short trials with the boy enabled him to acquire\r\nthe more prominent principles of pronunciation; and in the space of a\r\nfew days, he was able, not only to act as the boy’s interpreter with his\r\nfamily, but to converse with the most perfect freedom and fluency in the\r\nlanguage![293]\r\n\r\nMezzofanti received the clerical tonsure in the year 1795. In 1796 he\r\nwas admitted to the minor orders; and, on the 24th of September in the\r\nsame year, to the order of sub-deacon. On the first of April, 1797, he\r\nwas promoted to deaconship; and a few months later he was advanced, on\r\nSeptember 24th, 1797, to the holy order of priesthood.[294] At this time\r\nhe had only just completed his twenty-third year.\r\n\r\nThis anticipation of the age at which priesthood is usually conferred,\r\nwas probably owing to an appointment which he had just received (on the\r\n15th of September,)[295] in the university—that of professor of Arabic.\r\nSuch an appointment at this unprecedented age, is the highest testimony\r\nwhich could be rendered to his capacity as a general scholar, as well as\r\nto his eminence as a linguist.\r\n\r\nHe commenced his lectures on the 15th of the following December. Dr.\r\nSantagata, who was a student of the university at the time, speaks\r\nvery favourably of his opening lecture, not only for its learning and\r\nsolidity, but also for the beauty of its style, and its lucid and\r\npleasing arrangement.[296]\r\n\r\nUnhappily his tenure of the Arabic professorship was a very brief\r\nduration. The political relations of Bologna had just undergone a\r\ncomplete revolution. Early in 1796, very soon after the advance of the\r\nFrench army into Italy, Bonaparte had been invited by a discontented\r\nparty in Bologna to take possession of their city, and, in conjunction\r\nwith Saliceti, had occupied the fortresses on the 19th of January. At\r\nfirst after the French occupation, the Bolognese were flattered by a\r\nrevival of their old municipal institutions; but before the close of\r\n1796, the name of Bologna was merged in the common designation of the\r\nCisalpine Republic, by which all the French conquests in Northern Italy\r\nwere described. By the treaty of Tolentino, concluded in February, 1797,\r\nthe Pope was compelled formally to cede to this new Cisalpine Republic,\r\nthe three Legations of Bologna, Ferrara, and Romagna; and, in the\r\nsubsequent organization of the new territory, Bologna became the capital\r\nof the Dipartimento del Reno.\r\n\r\nOne of the first steps of the new rulers was to require of all employés\r\nan oath of fidelity to the Republic. The demand was enforced with great\r\nstrictness; and especially in the case of ecclesiastics, who in Italy,\r\nas in France, were naturally regarded with still greater suspicion\r\nby the Republican authorities, than even those civil servants of the\r\nold government who had been most distinguished for their loyalty.\r\nNevertheless the republican authorities themselves consented that an\r\nexception should be made in favour of a scholar of such promise as the\r\nAbate Mezzofanti. The oath was proposed to him, as to the rest of the\r\nprofessors. He firmly refused to take it. In other cases deprivation had\r\nbeen the immediate consequence of such refusal; but an effort was made to\r\nshake the firmness of Mezzofanti, and even to induce him without formally\r\naccepting the oath, to signify his compliance by some seeming act of\r\nadhesion to the established order of things. An intimation accordingly\r\nwas conveyed to him, that in his case the oath would be dispensed with,\r\nand that he would be allowed to retain his chair, if he would only\r\nconsent to make known by any overt act whatsoever, (even by a mere\r\ninterchange of courtesies with some of the officials of the Republic,)\r\nhis acceptance of its authority as now established.[297] But Mezzofanti\r\nwas at once too conscientious to compromise what he conceived to be his\r\nduty towards his natural sovereign, and too honourable to affect, by such\r\nunworthy temporizing, a disposition which he did not, and could not,\r\nhonestly entertain. He declined even to appear as a visitor in the salons\r\nof the new governor. He was accordingly deprived of his professorship in\r\nthe year 1798.\r\n\r\nHe was not alone in this generous fidelity. His friend Signora\r\nTambroni displayed equal firmness. It is less generally known that the\r\ndistinguished experimentalist, Ludovico Galvani,[298] was a martyr in the\r\nsame cause. Like Mezzofanti, on refusing the oath, he was stripped of all\r\nhis offices and emoluments. Less fortunate than Mezzofanti, he sunk under\r\nthe stroke. He was plunged into the deepest distress and debility; and,\r\nalthough his Republican rulers were at length driven by shame to decree\r\nhis restoration to his chair, the reparation came too late. He died in\r\n1798.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n[1798-1802.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe years which followed this forfeiture of his professorship were a\r\nperiod of much care, as well as of severe personal privation, for the\r\nAbate Mezzofanti.\r\n\r\nBoth his parents were still living;—his father no longer able to maintain\r\nhimself by his handicraft; his mother for some years afflicted with\r\npartial blindness, and in broken or failing health. The family of his\r\nsister, Teresa Minarelli, had already become very numerous, and the\r\nscanty earnings of her husband’s occupation hardly sufficed for their\r\nmaintenance, much less for the expenses of their education. In addition,\r\ntherefore, to his own necessities, Joseph Mezzofanti was now in great\r\nmeasure burdened with this twofold responsibility—a responsibility to\r\nwhich so affectionate a brother, and so dutiful a son could not be\r\nindifferent. To meet these demands, he had hitherto relied mainly upon\r\nthe income arising from his professorship, although this was miserably\r\ninadequate, the salaries attached to the professorships in Bologna, at\r\nthe time when Lalande visited Italy, (1765-6,) not exceeding a hundred\r\nRoman crowns, (little more than £25). Small, however, as it was, this\r\nsalary was Mezzofanti’s main source of income. As a title to ordination,\r\nthe archbishop of Bologna, Cardinal Giovanetti, had conferred upon him\r\ntwo small benefices, the united revenues of which, strange as it may\r\nsound in English ears, did not exceed eight pounds sterling;[299] and\r\nan excellent ecclesiastic, F. Anthony Magnani, who had long known and\r\nappreciated the virtues of the family, and had taken a warm interest in\r\nJoseph from his boyhood, settled upon him from his own private resources\r\nabout the same amount. Now, as Mezzofanti had devoted himself to\r\nliterature, and lived as a simple priest at Bologna, declining to accept\r\nany preferment to which the care of souls was annexed, this wretched\r\npittance constituted his entire income. It is true that he was about\r\nthis period chaplain of the Collegio Albornoz,[300] an ancient Spanish\r\nfoundation of the great Cardinal of that name;[301] but his services\r\nappear either to have been entirely gratuitous, or the emolument, if any,\r\nwas little more than nominal.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, when the Abate Mezzofanti, relying upon Providence, had the\r\ncourage to throw up, for conscience sake, the salary which constituted\r\nnearly two-thirds of his entire revenue, he found himself burdened with\r\nthe responsibilities already described, while his entire certain income\r\nwas considerably less than twenty pounds sterling! Nevertheless, gloomy\r\nand disheartening as was this prospect, far from suffering himself to\r\nbe cast down by it, he was even courageous enough to venture, about\r\nthis time, on the further responsibility of receiving his sister and\r\nher family into his own house. The renewal of hostilities in Italy, in\r\n1799, filled him with alarm for her security; and his nephew, Cavaliere\r\nMinarelli, who has been good enough to communicate to me a short MS.\r\nMemoir of the events of this period of his uncle’s life, still remembers\r\nthe day on which, while the French and Austrian troops were actually\r\nengaged before the walls, and the shot and shells had already begun to\r\nfall within the city, his uncle came to their house, at considerable\r\npersonal risk, and insisted that his sister and her children should\r\nremove to his own house which was in a less exposed position. From that\r\ndate (1799) they continued to reside with him.\r\n\r\nTo meet this increased expenditure, the Abate’s only resource lay in\r\nthat wearisome and ill-requited drudgery in which the best years of\r\nstruggling genius are so often frittered away—private instruction. He\r\nundertook the humble, but responsible, duties of private tutor, and\r\nturned industriously, if not very profitably, to account, the numerous\r\nacquisitions of his early years. There are few of the distinguished\r\nfamilies of Bologna, some of whose members were not among his pupils—the\r\nMarescalchi, Pallavicini, Ercolani, Martinetti, Bentivoglio, Marsigli,\r\nSampieri, Angelelli, Marchetti, and others. To these, as well as to\r\nseveral foreigners, he gave instructions in ancient and modern languages,\r\nto some in his own apartments, but more generally in their houses.\r\n\r\nAs regarded his own personal improvement in learning, these engagements,\r\nof course, were, for the most part, a wasteful expenditure of time\r\nand opportunities for study; but there was one of them—that with the\r\nMarescalchi family[302]—which supplied in the end an occasion for\r\nextending and improving his knowledge of languages. The library of the\r\nMarescalchi palace is especially rich in that department; and, as the\r\nmodest and engaging manners of Mezzofanti quickly established him on the\r\nfooting of a valued friend, rather than of an instructor, in the family,\r\nhe enjoyed unrestricted use of the opportunities for his own peculiar\r\nstudies which it afforded. In this family, too, one of the most ancient\r\nand distinguished in Bologna, he had frequent opportunities of meeting\r\nand conversing with foreigners, each in the language of his own country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt all events, whatever may have been his actual opportunities of study\r\nduring the years which succeeded his deprivation, it is certain that,\r\nupon the whole, his progress during that time was not less wonderful than\r\nat the most favoured periods of his life. Northern Italy, during this\r\ntroubled time, was the principal seat of the struggle between Austria\r\nand the French Republic; and from the first advance of the French in\r\n1796, till the decisive field of Marengo in 1800, Bologna found itself\r\nalternately in the occupation of one or other of the contending powers.\r\nFor nearly twelve months, however, after the battle of Trebbia, in July,\r\n1799, the Austrians remained in undisturbed possession. The army of\r\nAustria at that day comprised in its motley ranks, representatives of\r\nmost of the leading European languages—Teutonic, Slavonic, Czechish,\r\nMagyar, Romanic, &c. The intercourse with the officers and soldiery thus\r\nopened for Mezzofanti, in itself supplied a school of languages, which,\r\ntaken in conjunction with the university, and its other resources, it\r\nwould have been difficult to find in any other single European city,\r\nexcept Rome.\r\n\r\nAnd these advantages presented themselves to the Abate Mezzofanti, since\r\nhis advancement to the priesthood, in a way which enlisted still higher\r\nfeelings than that desire for knowledge which had hitherto formed his\r\nmain incentive to study.\r\n\r\nAll the accounts which have been preserved of the early years of his\r\nministry, concur in extolling his remarkable piety, his devotedness\r\nto the duties of the confessional,[303] and above all his active and\r\ntender charity. He had a share in every work of benevolence. He loved\r\nto organize little plans for the education of the poor. Notwithstanding\r\nhis numerous and pressing occupations, he was a constant visitant of\r\nthe numerous charitable institutions for which Bologna, even among the\r\nmunificent cities of Italy, has long been celebrated. He was particularly\r\ndevoted to the sick;—not only to the class who are called in Italy “the\r\nbashful poor,” whom he loved to seek out and visit at their own houses,\r\nand to whom, poor as he was in worldly wealth, his active benevolence\r\nenabled him to render services which money could not have procured;—but\r\nalso in the public hospitals, both civil and military. Now the terrible\r\ncampaign of 1796-’97, and again of 1799, had filled the camps of both\r\narmies with sick and wounded soldiers; and thus in the public hospitals\r\nof Bologna were constantly to be found invalids of almost every European\r\nrace. M. Manavit[304] states that, even before Mezzofanti was ordained\r\npriest, he had begun to act as interpreter to the wounded or dying in the\r\nhospitals, whether of their temporal or their spiritual wants and wishes.\r\nFrom the date of his ordination, of course, he was moved to the same\r\nservice by a zeal still higher and more holy.\r\n\r\n“I was at Bologna,” he himself told M. Manavit,[305] “during the time\r\nof the war. I was then young in the sacred ministry; it was my practice\r\nto visit the military hospitals. I constantly met there Hungarians,\r\nSlavonians, Germans, and Bohemians, who had been wounded in battle, or\r\ninvalided during the campaign; and it pained me to the heart that from\r\nwant of the means of communicating with them, I was unable to confess\r\nthose among them who were Catholics, or to bring back to the Church those\r\nwho were separated from her communion. In such cases, accordingly, I\r\nused to apply myself, with all my energy, to the study of the language\r\nof the patients, until I knew enough of them to make myself understood;\r\nI required no more. With these first rudiments I presented myself among\r\nthe sick wards. Such of the invalids as desired it, I managed to confess;\r\nwith others I held occasional conversations; and thus in a short time\r\nI acquired a considerable vocabulary. At length, through the grace of\r\nGod, assisted by my private studies, and by a retentive memory, I came\r\nto know, not merely the generic languages of the nations to which the\r\nseveral invalids belonged, but even the peculiar dialects of their\r\nvarious provinces.”\r\n\r\nIn this way, being already well acquainted with German, he became master\r\nsuccessively of Magyar, Bohemian, or Czechish, Polish, and even of the\r\nGipsy dialect, which he learned from one of that strange race, who was\r\na soldier in a Hungarian regiment quartered at Bologna during this\r\nperiod.[306] It is probable, too, that it was in the same manner he also\r\nlearned Russian. It is at least certain that he was able to speak that\r\nlanguage fluently, at the date of his acquaintance with the celebrated\r\nSuwarrow. Mezzofanti’s report of the acquirements of this “remarkable\r\nbarbarian” differs widely from the notion then popularly entertained\r\nregarding him. He described him as a most accomplished linguist, and\r\na well-read scholar. This report, it may be added, is fully confirmed\r\nby the most recent authorities, and Alison describes him as “highly\r\neducated, polished in his manners, speaking and writing seven languages\r\nwith facility, and extensively read, especially upon the art of war.”[307]\r\n\r\nIt was about this time also that Mezzofanti learned Flemish. He acquired\r\nthat language from a youth of Brussels, who came as a student to the\r\nUniversity of Bologna.[308]\r\n\r\nThe reputation which he was thus gradually establishing, of itself served\r\nto extend his opportunities of exercise in languages. Every foreigner who\r\nvisited Bologna sought his society for the purpose of testing personally\r\nthe truth of the marvellous reports which had been circulation. In these\r\ndays Bologna was the high road to Rome, and few visitors to that capital\r\nfailed to tarry for a short time at Bologna, to examine the many objects\r\nof interest which it contains. To all of these Mezzofanti found a ready\r\nand welcome access. There were few with whom his fertile vocabulary did\r\nnot supply some medium of communication; but, even when the stranger\r\ncould not speak any except the unknown tongue, Mezzofanti’s ready\r\ningenuity soon enabled him, as with the patients in the hospital, to\r\nestablish a system for the interchange of thought. A very small number\r\nof leading words sufficed as a foundation; and the almost instinctive\r\nfacility with which, by a single effort, he grasped all the principal\r\npeculiarities of the structure of each new language, speedily enabled\r\nhim to acquire enough of the essential inflections of each to enter\r\non the preliminaries of conversation. For his marvellous instinct of\r\nacquisitiveness this was enough. The iron tenacity of his memory never\r\nlet go a word, a phrase, an idiom, or even a sound, which it once had\r\nmastered.\r\n\r\nIn his zeal for the extension of the circle of his knowledge of\r\nlanguages, too, he pushed to the utmost the valuable opportunities\r\nderivable from the converse of foreigners. “The hotel-keepers,” he told\r\nM. Manavit,[309] “were in the habit of apprising me of the arrival of\r\nall strangers at Bologna. I made no difficulty when anything was to be\r\nlearned, about calling on them, interrogating them, making notes of their\r\ncommunications, and taking instructions from them in the pronunciation\r\nof their respective languages. A few learned Jesuits, and several\r\nSpaniards, Portuguese, and Mexicans, who resided at Bologna, afforded\r\nme valuable aid in learning both the ancient languages, and those of\r\ntheir own countries. I made it a rule to learn every new grammar, and\r\nto apply myself to every strange dictionary that came within my reach.\r\nI was constantly filling my head with new words; and, whenever any new\r\nstrangers, whether of high or low degree, passed through Bologna, I\r\nendeavoured to turn them to account, using the one for the purpose of\r\nperfecting my pronunciation, and the other for that of learning the\r\nfamiliar words and turns of expression. I must confess, too, that it cost\r\nme but little trouble; for, in addition to an excellent memory, God had\r\nblessed me with an incredible flexibility of the organs of speech.”\r\n\r\nOccasionally, too, he received applications from merchants, bankers, and\r\neven private individuals, to translate for them portions of their foreign\r\ncorrespondence which chanced to be written in some of the languages of\r\nless ordinary occurrence. In all such cases, Dr. Santagata[310] says,\r\nMezzofanti was the unfailing resource; and his good nature was as ready\r\nas his knowledge was universal. He cheerfully rendered to every applicant\r\nevery such assistance; and it was his invariable rule never to accept any\r\nremuneration whatsoever for this or any similar service.[311]\r\n\r\nEven his regular priestly duties as a confessor now contributed, as his\r\nextraordinary duties in the hospitals had done before, to enlarge his\r\nstock of languages. He was soon marked out as the “foreigners’ confessor”\r\n(_confessario dei forestieri_) of Bologna, an office which, in Rome and\r\nother Catholic cities, is generally entrusted to a staff consisting\r\nof many individuals. Almost every foreigner was sure to find a ready\r\nresource in Mezzofanti; though it more than once happened that, as a\r\npreliminary step towards receiving the confession of the party applying\r\nfor this office of his ministry, he had to place himself as a pupil in\r\nthe hands of the intending penitent, and to acquire from him or her the\r\nrudiments of the language in which they were to communicate with each\r\nother. The process to him was simple enough. If the stranger was able to\r\nrepeat for him the Commandments, the Lord’s Prayer, the Apostles’ Creed,\r\nor any one of those familiar prayers which are the common property of all\r\nChristian countries, or even to supply the names of a few of the leading\r\nideas of Christian theology, as God, sin, virtue, earth, heaven, hell,\r\n&c., it was sufficient for Mezzofanti. In many cases he proceeded to\r\nbuild, upon a foundation not a whit more substantial than this, the whole\r\nfabric of the grammar, and to a great extent even of the vocabulary, of\r\na language. A remarkable instance of this faculty I shall have to relate\r\nin the later years of his life. Another, which belongs to the present\r\nperiod, has been communicated to me by Cardinal Wiseman. “Mezzofanti\r\ntold me,” says his Eminence, “that a lady from the island of Sardinia\r\nonce came to Bologna, bringing with her a maid who could speak nothing\r\nbut the Sardinian dialect, a soft patois composed of Latin, Italian, and\r\nSpanish (e.g., Mezzofanti told me that _columba mia_ is Sardinian for “my\r\nwife.”) As Easter approached the girl became anxious and unhappy about\r\nconfession, despairing of finding a confessor to whom she should be able\r\nto make herself understood. The lady sent for Mezzofanti; but at that\r\ntime he had never thought of learning the language. He told the lady,\r\nnevertheless, that, in a fortnight, he would be prepared to hear her\r\nmaid’s confession. She laughed at the idea; but Mezzofanti persisted, and\r\ncame to the house every evening for about an hour. When Easter arrived,\r\nhe was able to speak Sardinian fluently, and heard the girl’s confession!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt might be instructive to trace the order in which the several\r\nlanguages which he mastered in this earlier part of his career were\r\nsuccessively acquired. But unfortunately neither the papers and letters\r\nwhich have been preserved, nor the recollections of the few friends who\r\nhave survived, have thrown much light upon this interesting inquiry.\r\nAll accounts, however, agree in representing his life during these\r\nyears as laborious almost beyond belief. The weary hours occupied in\r\nthe drudgery of tuition; the time given to the manifold self-imposed\r\noccupations described in this chapter; the time spent in the ordinary\r\ndevotional exercises of a priest, and in the performance of those duties\r\nof the ministry in the hospitals and elsewhere which he had undertaken;\r\nabove all, the time regularly and perseveringly given to his great\r\nand all-engrossing study of languages;—may well be thought to form an\r\naggregate of laborious application hardly surpassed in the whole range of\r\nliterary history. It fully confirms the well-known assurance of the noble\r\nPrologue of Bacon’s “Advancement of Learning:” “Let no man doubt that\r\nlearning will expulse business, but rather it will keep and defend the\r\npossession of the mind against idleness and pleasure, which otherwise may\r\nenter at unawares to the prejudice of both.” Other students may perhaps\r\nhave devoted a longer time to continuous application. The celebrated\r\nJesuit theologian, Father Suarez, is said to have spent seventeen hours\r\nout of the twenty-four between his studies and his devotions. Castell,\r\nthe author of the Heptaglot Lexicon, declares, in the feeling address\r\nwhich accompanied its publication, that his thankless and unrequited\r\ntask had occupied him for sixteen or eighteen hours every day during\r\ntwenty years.[312] Theophilus Raynaud, during his long life of eighty\r\nyears, only allowed himself a quarter of an hour daily from his studies\r\nfor dinner;[313] and the Puritan divine, Prynne, seldom would spare\r\ntime to dine at all.[314] It may be doubted whether the actual labour\r\nof Mezzofanti, broken up and divided over so many almost incompatible\r\noccupations, did not equal and perhaps exceed them all in amount, if not\r\nin intensity. According to the account of Guido Görres,[315] his time for\r\nsleep, during this period of his life, was limited to three hours.[316]\r\nHis self-denial in all other respects was almost equally wonderful.\r\nHe was singularly abstemious both in eating and in drinking; and his\r\npower of enduring the intense cold which prevails in the winter months\r\nthroughout the whole of Northern Italy, especially in the vicinity of the\r\nApennines, was a source of wonder even to his own family. During the long\r\nnights which he devoted to study he never, even in the coldest weather,\r\npermitted himself the indulgence of a fire.\r\n\r\nI may here mention that he continued the same practice to the end of his\r\nlife. Even after his elevation to the cardinalate, he could hardly ever\r\nbe induced to have recourse to a fire, or even to the little portable\r\nbrazier, called _scaldino_, which students in Italy commonly employ, as a\r\nresource against the numbness of the feet and hands produced by the dry\r\nbut piercing cold which characterizes the Italian winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n[1803-1806.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of 1803, those difficulties of the Abate\r\nMezzofanti’s position, which merely arose from the straitness of his\r\nincome, began gradually to diminish. On the 29th of January in that year\r\nhe was appointed assistant librarian of the _Istituto_ of Bologna; one of\r\nthose munificent literary institutions of which Italy is so justly proud,\r\nfounded in the end of the seventeenth century by the celebrated General\r\nCount Marsigli, and enriched by the munificence of many successive\r\nscholars and citizens of Bologna; especially of the great Bolognese Pope,\r\nBenedict XIV. Its collections and museums are among the finest in Italy;\r\nand the library contains above a hundred and fifty thousand volumes.\r\n\r\nBut whatever of pecuniary advantage he derived from this appointment, was\r\nperhaps more than counterbalanced by the constant demand upon his time\r\nfrom the charge of so extensive a library: especially as he confesses\r\nthat, up to that period, he had seldom bestowed a thought on the study\r\nof bibliography. To add to the ordinary engagements of librarian, too,\r\nit was determined, sometime after Mezzofanti’s appointment, to prepare\r\na Catalogue Raisonné, in which the Oriental and Greek department\r\nnaturally fell to his share. For the Oriental department of the library\r\nthere seems, up to this time, to have been no catalogue, or at least an\r\nexceedingly imperfect and inaccurate one; and as a definite time was\r\nfixed for the completion of the task, it became for Mezzofanti a source\r\nof serious and protracted embarrassment, to which he alludes more than\r\nonce in his correspondence.\r\n\r\nA more congenial occupation, however, was offered to him soon afterwards.\r\nIn the end of the same year, he was restored to his former position in\r\nthe university. On the 4th of November in that year, he was appointed\r\nProfessor of Oriental Languages;—a place which he was enabled to hold in\r\nconjunction with his office in the Library of the Institute.\r\n\r\nA few months after his installation, he read at the university, June\r\n23rd, 1804, on the occasion of conferring degrees, the first public\r\ndissertation of which I have been able to discover any record. The\r\nsubject was “The Egyptian Obelisks.” The dissertation itself has been\r\nlost; but Count Simone Stratico, of Pavia, to whom we owe the notice of\r\nits delivery, speaks of it as “most judicious and learned,” and replete\r\nwith antiquarian erudition.[317]\r\n\r\nThe Oriental Professorship in the neighbouring University of Parma, was\r\nat this time held by the celebrated John Bernard de Rossi. Mezzofanti had\r\nlong desired to form the acquaintance of this distinguished Orientalist;\r\nand more than once projected a visit to Parma, for the purpose of placing\r\nhimself in communication with him on the subject of his favourite\r\nstudy. His duties as assistant Librarian at length afforded the desired\r\nopportunity. Having occasion to order some of De Rossi’s works from\r\nParma, he addressed to De Rossi himself a letter which soon led to a warm\r\nand intimate friendship, and was the commencement of an interesting,\r\nalthough not very frequent, correspondence, which continued, at irregular\r\nintervals, up to the time of De Rossi’s death. Some of Mezzofanti’s\r\nletters to De Rossi, which are preserved in the Library of Parma, have\r\nbeen kindly placed at my disposal. They are chiefly interesting as\r\nthrowing some light on the progress of his studies.\r\n\r\nThe first is dated September 15th, 1804—\r\n\r\n    _To the Abate John Bernard de Rossi, Professor of Oriental\r\n    Languages._\r\n\r\n                                      _Bologna, September 15, 1804._\r\n\r\n    Most illustrious Signor Abate.—I have long admired and\r\n    profited by your rare acquirements, which your learned works\r\n    have made known all over Europe; and I have, for some time,\r\n    been projecting a visit to Parma, for the double purpose of\r\n    tendering to you a personal assurance of my esteem, and of\r\n    examining your far-famed library. Finding my hope disappointed\r\n    for the present, I take advantage of a favourable opportunity\r\n    to offer you, at least in writing, some expression of the\r\n    profound respect which I feel for one so distinguished in the\r\n    same studies which I myself pursue with great ardour, although\r\n    with very inferior success. I am desirous also to procure those\r\n    of your works marked nos. 22, 24, 25, and 26, in the catalogue\r\n    kindly forwarded by you through Professor Ranzani. Pray give to\r\n    the bearer of this letter any of the above numbers which may be\r\n    in readiness: he will immediately settle for them.\r\n\r\n    May I venture to hope that, for the future, you will allow\r\n    me, when any difficulty occurs to me in my Oriental reading,\r\n    to have recourse to your profound knowledge of Oriental\r\n    literature, and also that you will accept the sincere assurance\r\n    of the esteem with which I declare myself\r\n\r\n                  Your most humble and devoted servant\r\n\r\n                                    D. Joseph Mezzofanti,\r\n                                    Professor of Oriental Languages.\r\n\r\nDe Rossi replied by an exceedingly courteous letter, accompanied\r\nby a present of several books connected with Oriental literature,\r\nand manifesting so friendly an interest in the studies of his young\r\ncorrespondent, that Mezzofanti never afterwards hesitated to consult him\r\nwhen occasion arose. Their letters, in accordance with the ceremonious\r\netiquette which characterizes all the correspondence of that period, are\r\nsomewhat stiff and formal; but their intercourse was marked throughout by\r\nan active and almost tender interest upon the one side, and a respectful\r\nbut yet affectionate admiration upon the other.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, Mezzofanti’s own increasing reputation led to his\r\nbeing frequently consulted upon difficulties of the same kind. On one\r\nof these—a book in some unknown character which had been sent for his\r\nexamination by Monsignor Bevilacqua, a learned prelate at Ferrara—he,\r\nin his turn, consults De Rossi. His letter is chiefly curious as showing\r\n(what will appear strange to our modern philologers) that up to this\r\ndate Mezzofanti was entirely unacquainted with Sanscrit. The importance\r\nof that language and the wide range of its relations, which Frederic\r\nSchlegel was almost the first to estimate aright, were not at this time\r\nfully appreciated.\r\n\r\n    _To Professor Ab. John Bernard De Rossi._\r\n\r\n                                        _Bologna, February 4, 1805._\r\n\r\n    The works which I lately received from you have only served\r\n    to confirm the estimate of your powers which I had formed\r\n    from those with which I was previously acquainted; while the\r\n    obliging letter and valuable present which accompanied them,\r\n    equally convinced me of the kindness of your heart. May I\r\n    hope that this kindness, as well as your profound erudition,\r\n    may establish for me a title to claim the permission which I\r\n    solicited in my last letter? I venture, therefore, to enclose\r\n    to you a printed page in unknown characters, which the owner\r\n    of the original, Mgr. Alessandro Bevilacqua of Ferrara, tells\r\n    me has been already examined by several savants, but to no\r\n    purpose. The book comes originally from Congo;[318] having\r\n    been brought thence to Ferrara by a Capuchin of the same\r\n    respectable family. Being full of the idea of Sanscrit, to\r\n    which I earnestly long to apply myself as soon as I shall find\r\n    means for the study, I was at first inclined to suspect that\r\n    this might be the Sanscrit character; but this is a mere fancy\r\n    of mine, or at best a guess. I look, therefore, to your more\r\n    extensive knowledge for a satisfactory solution of the doubt;\r\n    and meanwhile pray you to accept the assurance of my sincere\r\n    gratitude and esteem.\r\n\r\nThis correspondence with De Rossi, also, shows very remarkably that,\r\nhowever, at a later period of his career, Mezzofanti’s wonderful faculty\r\nof language may have been sharpened by practice into what appears almost\r\nan instinct, his method of study at this time was exact, laborious, and\r\nperhaps even plodding. He appears, from the very first, to have pursued\r\nas a means of study that system of written composition which was the\r\namusement of his later years; and he occasionally availed himself of\r\nDe Rossi’s superior knowledge and experience so far as to submit these\r\ncompositions for his judgment and correction.\r\n\r\nIt is to one of these he alludes in the following letter:—\r\n\r\n                                          _Bologna, April 15, 1805._\r\n\r\n    I send you a translation in twelve languages of a short Latin\r\n    sentence, in the hope that you will kindly correct any mistakes\r\n    into which I may have fallen. I have been obliged to write it\r\n    almost impromptu (_su due piedi_). I mention this, however,\r\n    not to excuse my own blunders, but to throw the blame of\r\n    them on those who have forced me to the task. Not having a\r\n    single individual within reach with whom to take counsel, I\r\n    have been obliged to impose this trouble upon one whose kind\r\n    courtesy will make it seem light to him. Accept my thanks in\r\n    anticipation of your compliance.\r\n\r\n    P. S. I should feel obliged if you could let me have your\r\n    observations by return of post. Pray attribute this, perhaps\r\n    excessive, liberty to the peculiar circumstances in which I am\r\n    placed.\r\n\r\nI have in vain endeavoured to ascertain what were the twelve languages\r\nof this curious essay. As no trace of the copy is now to be found among\r\nDe Rossi’s papers, it seems probable that De Rossi, in complying with\r\nthe request contained in the letter, returned the paper to the writer\r\nwith his own corrections. But whatever these “twelve languages” may have\r\nbeen, it is certain that, even at the date of this letter, Mezzofanti’s\r\nattainments were by no means confined to that limit. My attention\r\nhas been called to a notice of him contained in a curious, though\r\nlittle-known work, published at Milan in 1806,[319] which describes his\r\nrange of languages as far more extensive.\r\n\r\nThe work to which I refer is the narrative of an occurrence, which,\r\nalthough not uncommon even down to a later date, it is difficult\r\nnow-a-days,—since Islam has ceased to\r\n\r\n    ——————————wield, as of old, her thirsty lance,\r\n    And shake her crimson plumage to the skies,—\r\n\r\nto realize as an actual incident of the nineteenth century;[320]—the\r\nadventures of an amateur antiquarian, who was made captive by Corsairs\r\nand carried into Barbary. The hero of this adventure was a Milanese\r\necclesiastic, Father Felix Caronni. He embarked at Palermo for Naples, in\r\na small merchant vessel laden with oranges, but had scarcely quitted the\r\nshore when a pirate-ship hove in sight. The crew, as commonly happened\r\nin such cases, took to the boat and escaped, leaving Father Caronni and\r\neighteen other passengers to the mercy of the Corsairs, who speedily\r\noverpowered the defenceless little vessel. Caronni, as a subject of the\r\nItalian Republic and a French citizen,[321] would have been secured\r\nagainst capture; but his passport was in the hands of the captain who had\r\nescaped; and thus, notwithstanding his protestations, he was seized along\r\nwith the rest, and, under circumstances of great cruelty and indignity,\r\nthey were all carried into Tunis. Here, however, at the reclamation of\r\nthe French, supported by the Austrian Consul, Father Caronni was saved\r\nfrom the fate which awaited the rest of the captives—of being sold into\r\nslavery,—and at the end of three months, (part of which he devoted to the\r\nexploration of the antiquities of Tunis and the surrounding district,)\r\nhe was set at liberty and permitted to return to Italy.\r\n\r\nBeing at a loss, while preparing the narrative of his captivity for\r\npublication, for a translation of the papers which he received at Tunis\r\nwhen he was set at liberty, he had recourse to the assistance of the\r\nAbate Mezzofanti, as he explains in the following passage.\r\n\r\n“No sooner,” says he, “had I obtained the _Tiscara_[322] [passport,] than\r\nI made an exact copy of it (with the exception of the Bey’s seal,) in\r\nthe precise dimensions of the original. It was not so easy, however, to\r\nobtain a translation of this document in Italy, both because it had been\r\nhastily written with a reed—the instrument which the Moors employ for\r\nthat purpose—and because there were introduced into it certain ciphers\r\nwhich are peculiar to the Arabs of Barbary. These difficulties, however,\r\nwere happily overcome, thanks to the exceeding courtesy, as well as the\r\ndistinguished learning of the Abate Mezzofanti, Professor of Oriental\r\nLanguages in the Institute of Bologna, who is commonly reputed to be\r\nmaster of more than twenty-four languages, the greater number of which he\r\nspeaks with fluency and purity. He has favoured me (in four long letters\r\nwhich contain as much information as might supply a whole course of\r\nlectures) with a literal and critically exact version of it, accompanied\r\nby copious explanations, as also by a free translation in the following\r\nterms:—\r\n\r\n          “‘THERE IS BUT ONE GOD, AND MAHOMET IS HIS PROPHET.’\r\n\r\n    “‘We have liberated Father Felix Caronni. He is hereby\r\n    permitted to embark from Goletta for the country of the\r\n    Christians, at the intervention of the French Consul, through\r\n    the medium of his Dragoman, in consideration of the payment of\r\n    ninety-nine sequins mahbub, and by the privilege of the mighty\r\n    and generous Hamudah[323] Basha Bey, Ben-Dani, whom may God\r\n    prosper!\r\n\r\n                                 “Second Giomada, in the year 1219.’\r\n\r\n“_Giomada_[324] is the name of the sixth month of the Arabs, and the\r\nyear indicated is the year of their Hegira.[325] And, as the Oriental\r\nwriting runs in the reverse order to ours, (that is, from right to\r\nleft,) it is necessary, in order that the words of the translation may\r\ncorrespond with those of the original, to take the precaution of reading\r\nit backwards, or, what will answer the same purpose, in a mirror. What\r\nwill strike the reader, however, as most strange, (as it did myself when\r\nfirst the Tiscara was translated for me) is its particularizing the\r\n‘payment of ninety-nine gold mahbubs,’ which, at the rate of nine _lire_\r\nto each, would make eight hundred and ninety-one Milanese _lire_: whereas\r\nthis is utterly false as far as I am personally concerned, and the French\r\ncommissary did not give me the least intimation of any payment whatever.\r\nThe Abate Mezzofanti suggests with much probability, that it may be a\r\npart of the _stylus curiæ_ of these greedy barbarians to boast in their\r\npiratical diplomacy that no Christian, and still more no ecclesiastic,\r\nhas ever been made captive by them without being, even though a Frank,\r\nsupposed to be a lawful prize, and consequently without being made ‘to\r\nbleed’ a little.”[326]\r\n\r\nThis is the first published notice of Mezzofanti which has come under my\r\nobservation; and it is particularly interesting as an early example of\r\nhis habit of cultivating not only the principal languages, but the minor\r\nvarieties of each. The knowledge that, when he had barely completed his\r\nthirtieth year, he was reputed to be master of _more than twenty-four\r\nlanguages_, may perhaps prepare us to regard with less incredulity the\r\nmarvels which we shall find related of his more advanced career.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of the same year the Abate Mezzofanti paid his\r\nlong-intended visit to Parma and De Rossi. The Italians, and especially\r\nthe literary men of Italy, are proverbially bad travellers. Magliabecchi\r\nnever was outside of the gates of Florence in his life, except on two\r\noccasions;—once as far as Fiesole, which may almost be called a suburb\r\nof the city, and once again to a distance of ten miles. Many an Italian\r\nProfessor has passed an entire life without any longer excursion than\r\nthe daily walk from his lodgings to the lecture-room. Even the great\r\ngeographer, D’Anville, who lived to the age of eighty-five, is said never\r\nto have left his native city, Paris;[327] and yet he was able to point\r\nout many errors in the plan of the Troad made upon the spot by the Comte\r\nde Choiseul. It has been frequently alleged of Mezzofanti, also, as\r\nenhancing still more the marvel of his acquirements in languages, that,\r\nuntil his fortieth year, he had never quitted his native city. That this\r\nstatement is not literally true appears from a letter which he wrote to\r\nthe Abate de Rossi, on his return to Bologna, after the visit to which I\r\nhave alluded.\r\n\r\n    “Pressed as I am, by my many occupations,” he says, November\r\n    11, 1805, “I cannot delay writing at least a few lines, in\r\n    grateful acknowledgment of the kindnesses which I received from\r\n    you during my happy sojourn in your city.\r\n\r\n    “I had been prepared for this, as well by the reports of others\r\n    regarding your amiable disposition, as by the courtesy which\r\n    I had myself experienced; but all my anticipations had fallen\r\n    far short of the reality. Feeling that it is impossible for me\r\n    to offer you a suitable acknowledgment, I beg that, although\r\n    I have neither words to express it, nor means of giving it\r\n    effect, you will believe me to be deeply sensible of my\r\n    obligation to you. I shall preserve all your valued presents\r\n    with most jealous care. The ‘Persian Anthology’[328] has been\r\n    greatly relished by all here who apply to the study of that\r\n    language.\r\n\r\n    “I shall often have to claim your indulgence for the trouble\r\n    which I shall not fail to give you. After the many proofs I\r\n    have had of your kindness, I feel that I should be offending\r\n    you, were I to ask you to let me hope to reckon myself\r\n    henceforward among your friends.”\r\n\r\nThe friendly courtesy of the Abate De Rossi rendered Mezzofanti’s stay at\r\nParma exceedingly agreeable. One of the friends whom he made during this\r\nvisit, the learned and venerable Librarian of the Ducal Library of that\r\ncity, Cavaliere Angelo Pezzana, still survives, and still speaks with an\r\naffection which borders upon tenderness of the friendship which resulted\r\nfrom their first meeting, and which was the pride of his later life.\r\nAmong the subjects of their conversation, Cavaliere Pezzana particularly\r\nremembers some observations of Mezzofanti on certain affinities between\r\nthe Russian and Latin languages, which struck him by their acuteness and\r\noriginality.\r\n\r\nA commission which M. Pezzana gave him at his departure led to the\r\nfollowing letter:—\r\n\r\n                                       _Bologna, November 11, 1805._\r\n\r\n    In the hope of being able to execute the little commission you\r\n    gave me regarding the Aldine edition of Aristotle, I have put\r\n    off writing until I should have searched in our Library.—On\r\n    doing so, I find that I have been mistaken, as there is no\r\n    copy of that edition here. I avail myself, however, of this\r\n    opportunity to renew the assurance of my gratitude for the\r\n    numberless kindnesses which you shewed me during the time it\r\n    was my good fortune to be in your society;—kindnesses which I\r\n    never can forget, and for which it is my most anxious desire\r\n    to find some opportunity of making you a return. I beg you\r\n    to present my respects to Dr. Tommasini, and to offer to\r\n    Signor Bodoni and his lady my acknowledgments for their great\r\n    courtesy. Should any occasion arise in which my humble services\r\n    can be of use, I shall consider myself happy, if you will\r\n    always put aside every idea of my occupations, and will honour\r\n    me with your valued commands. Meanwhile accept the assurance of\r\n    my sincere esteem and attachment.\r\n\r\nMezzofanti’s intimacy with the two gentlemen named in this letter,\r\nTommasini and Bodoni, was lasting and sincere. Tommasini, although an\r\neminent physician of Parma and an active member of most of the scientific\r\nsocieties of his day, is little known outside of Italy: but Bodoni, the\r\ncelebrated printer and publisher of Parma, whose magnificent editions of\r\nthe classics are still among the treasures of every great library, was\r\na man of rare merit, and a not unworthy representative of the learned\r\nfathers of his craft, the Stephens, the Manuzi, and Plantins of the\r\npalmy days of typography. He was a native of Saluzzo in the kingdom of\r\nSardinia. His early taste for wood-engraving induced him to visit Rome\r\nfor the purpose of study: and he set out in company with a school-fellow,\r\nwhose uncle held some office in the Roman court. Bodoni supported himself\r\nand his companion upon the way by the sale of his little engravings,\r\nwhich are now prized as curiosities in the art. On their arrival,\r\nhowever, being coldly received by the friend on whom they had mainly\r\nrelied, they resolved to return home; but before leaving Rome, Bodoni\r\npaid a visit to the printing-office of the Propaganda, where he had the\r\ngood fortune to attract the notice of the Abate Ruggieri, then director\r\nof that great press. He thus obtained employment in the establishment,\r\nand at the same time was permitted to attend the Oriental Schools of the\r\nSapienza; and thus having learned Hebrew and Arabic, he was employed\r\nexclusively upon the Oriental works printed by the Propaganda. The\r\nexcellence and accuracy of the editions of the _Missale Arabico-Coptum_,\r\nand the _Alphabetum Tibetanum_ of Padre Giorgi which Bodoni printed,\r\nexcited universal admiration; and when, on occasion of the tragical death\r\nof his friend and patron Ruggieri, he resolved to leave Rome, he was\r\nearnestly invited to settle in England: but he accepted in preference an\r\ninvitation to Parma, where he was appointed Director of the Ducal Press,\r\nand where all the well-known master-pieces of his art were successively\r\nproduced. Himself a man of much learning, and of a highly cultivated\r\nmind, he enjoyed the friendship of most of the literati of Italy.\r\n\r\n    Blest with a taste exact, yet unconfined,\r\n    A knowledge both of books and human kind—\r\n\r\nhis conversation was in the highest degree entertaining and instructive;\r\nand his correspondence, which has been published, is full of interest.\r\nWith the Abate De Rossi, who employed his press in all his Oriental\r\npublications,[329] he was for years on terms of the closest intimacy;\r\nand during Mezzofanti’s visit to Parma, he treated De Rossi’s young\r\ndisciple with a courtesy which Mezzofanti long and gratefully remembered.\r\nBodoni’s wife, who, upon his death in 1813, succeeded to his vast\r\nestablishment, was, like her husband, highly cultivated, and a most\r\namiable and excellent woman.\r\n\r\nAmong the languages which occupied Mezzofanti at this time, Persian\r\nappears to have received the principal share of his attention. One of the\r\nfirst presents which he received from De Rossi was, as we have seen, a\r\n“Persian Anthology;” and in a letter to De Rossi, written early in 1806\r\n(which Cavaliere Pezzana has published in the Modena Journal, _Memorie\r\ndi Religione_,) he expresses much anxiety to obtain a copy of the great\r\nPersian classic, Kemal Eddin.\r\n\r\nThe same letter, however, contains another request from which it may be\r\ninferred that much of his time was still drawn away from these studies by\r\nhis duties as librarian. Speaking of the catalogue then in preparation,\r\nhe complains of the miserably defective condition of the library in the\r\ndepartment of Bibliography; and begs of his correspondent to send him the\r\ntitles of the _Bibliotheca_ of Hottinger, (perhaps his _Promptuarium, seu\r\nBibliotheca Orientalis_, Heidelberg, 1658) and that of Wolff, in order\r\nthat he may provide himself with these works, as a guide in his task.\r\n\r\nOn this subject he speaks more explicitly in a letter of the 3rd of\r\nMarch, in the same year. After alluding to a commission of De Rossi’s\r\nwhich he had failed in executing, he proceeds:—\r\n\r\n    The preparation of the Catalogue keeps me in constant\r\n    occupation, because these Oriental books are for the most part\r\n    without the name of the author or the title of the work. Their\r\n    value, that is to say their scientific importance, bears no\r\n    proportion to the labour they cost; inasmuch as they are all\r\n    Grammatical Treatises, books of Law, and such like. However,\r\n    should I meet any work of interest, I shall not fail to\r\n    communicate it to you; although, I fancy, it will be difficult\r\n    to meet with anything that you do not know already.\r\n\r\n    I received from Vienna immediately on its publication, the\r\n    Grammar of the learned Dombay,[330] who is well known for other\r\n    works, particularly upon the language and history of Morocco.\r\n    It happens that I have got two copies of it; and I have set one\r\n    of them apart for you, for which you may perhaps give me in\r\n    exchange one of your own duplicates. It contains the Grammar\r\n    arranged after the manner of the Latin Grammarians; the rules\r\n    of Persian according to Meninski,[331] with this advantage,\r\n    that here they are given in consecutive order, whereas in\r\n    Meninski they are found mixed up with those of the Arabic and\r\n    Turkish. Your friend, M. Silvestre de Sacy, reviewed it in\r\n    the _Magazin Encyclopedique_, and took exception to Dombay’s\r\n    reducing the Persian to the system of the Latin Grammar. I hope\r\n    shortly to receive the other from Leipsic, as also the tales of\r\n    Nizami, in Persian and Latin, printed by Wolff, and published\r\n    by L. Hill, who promised for the same year, 1802, an edition of\r\n    the _Divan_ of Hafiz.[332]\r\n\r\n    I am only waiting for a safe opportunity to forward your books.\r\n    We cannot fail of one in the coming spring. As to the “Oriental\r\n    Anthology,” I have given it in charge to the courier as far as\r\n    Milan, but have not yet heard intelligence of it.\r\n\r\n    Book-buying is undoubtedly very troublesome, and the least\r\n    disagreeable part of it is the money the books cost, although\r\n    in Oriental works I always find this excessive. I beg you not\r\n    to spare me whenever any occasion offers in which my services\r\n    may be useful.\r\n\r\nThe Abate de Rossi had requested to be furnished with a note of the\r\nprincipal Oriental MSS. of the Bologna collection; but Mezzofanti’s\r\nlabour in preparing the general Catalogue was so great, and the time\r\nfixed for its completion was so entirely inadequate, that, for a\r\nconsiderable time, he was unable to comply with his friend’s request.\r\nIt is to this he alludes in the following letter, dated May 11, 1806.\r\nAfter apologizing for the delay in forwarding the book referred to in the\r\nletter of March 3rd, he proceeds:—\r\n\r\n    My labour at the Catalogue still continues, nor can I hope at\r\n    the period appointed for its close, to have done more than\r\n    merely sketch it out;—that is, we shall have nothing entered\r\n    but the bare titles of the works. This, however, in itself,\r\n    is a task so difficult in our Oriental MSS., that, up to the\r\n    present time, it has never been satisfactorily done. Besides\r\n    the Oriental books, I have also to deal with the Greek; and all\r\n    must be in readiness within the coming month. The truth is that\r\n    I should require a year at least to give a proper shape to my\r\n    labour, and in the beginning my impression was that it would\r\n    require two. And in my present difficulty, what gives me most\r\n    pain is that I am not able to send you, as early as I could\r\n    wish, the note which you have often expressed a wish to obtain;\r\n    but I shall send it the very first moment in my power.\r\n\r\n    I have received your new work,[333] for which I beg you to\r\n    accept my best thanks. I did not write at the moment, knowing\r\n    you do not like very frequent letters; I have besides too much\r\n    respect for time devoted like yours to the honour of Italy, on\r\n    which your works in Oriental literature have shed a lustre. I\r\n    long nevertheless for a fitting opportunity to prove to you the\r\n    sincerity of my gratitude.\r\n\r\nUnder this constant and protracted labour Mezzofanti’s health began\r\nto give way. His chest was seriously threatened during the summer of\r\n1806, and had it not been that he fortunately obtained an extension of\r\nthe time allotted for the completion of his task at the Catalogue, it\r\nis not unlikely that his constitution, naturally weak, might have been\r\npermanently enfeebled. Family cares, too, formed no inconsiderable part\r\nof his burden. The health of his mother, which had for a long time been\r\nvery uncertain, was completely broken down. She was now entirely blind.\r\nFor many weeks of this season he was in daily apprehension of her death;\r\nand, in the pressure of his engagements, his hours of attendance on her\r\nsick bed were subtracted from the time hitherto devoted to rest, already\r\nsufficiently curtailed.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these cares and occupations, Mezzofanti was surprised\r\nby a flattering invitation to transfer his residence to Paris, with a\r\npromise of patronage and distinction from the Emperor Napoleon, who was\r\nat this time eagerly engaged in plans for the development of the literary\r\nand artistic glories of his capital. More than one of Mezzofanti’s\r\ncountrymen were already in the enjoyment of high honours at Paris. First\r\namong them may be named Volta, for many years Professor of Natural\r\nPhilosophy in the University of Pavia. More pliant than his great\r\nfellow-discoverer, Galvani, or perhaps more favourably circumstanced as\r\nnot being, like him, a member of a Papal University, he had escaped the\r\nproscription which brought Galvani to his grave—one of those victims of\r\nloyalty whom Petrarch declares\r\n\r\n          ————assai più belli\r\n    Con la lor povertà, che Mida o Crasso\r\n    Con l’oro, ond’ a virtù furon ribelli;—\r\n\r\nVolta was called from Pavia to Paris, where he was rewarded with\r\ndistinctions, emoluments, titles, and, more flattering than all, with the\r\npersonal notice and patronage of the great conqueror himself, who was\r\noften present at his experiments, and displayed a warm interest in the\r\nresults to which they led.[334]\r\n\r\nSuch were at this period the tempting rewards of scientific or literary\r\neminence in France. Moreover, Count Marescalchi, in whose family\r\nMezzofanti had acted as tutor and librarian during the years of his\r\ndeprivation, was now Resident Minister of the Kingdom of Italy at Paris.\r\nThe Count’s intercourse with Mezzofanti was but little interrupted by\r\ntheir separation; and, even during his residence in Paris, the latter\r\ncontinued to correspond with him; chiefly on matters connected with the\r\neducation of his children, or with the completion or extension of his\r\nnoble library. The extent of their intimacy indeed may be inferred from\r\none of Mezzofanti’s letters to the Count, dated September 16, 1806,\r\nin which we find him freely employing the services of the minister in\r\nprocuring books at Paris, not only for himself but for his literary\r\nfriends in Bologna.[335]\r\n\r\nIt was through this Count Marescalchi that the invitation to Paris was\r\nconveyed to Mezzofanti, and it cannot be doubted that it was accompanied\r\nby a warm recommendation from the Count himself. No trace of this formal\r\ncorrespondence is now discoverable; but probably far more interesting,\r\nas it is certainly far more characteristic, than the official letter or\r\nreply, is the following playful letter to one of Count Marescalchi’s\r\nsons, Carlino (Charlie), Mezzofanti’s former pupil—now the representative\r\nof the house—who had written a special letter, to add the expression of\r\nhis own wishes to those of his father, that his old instructor should\r\njoin them once again at Paris.\r\n\r\n                                      _Bologna, September 16, 1806._\r\n\r\n    But three letters, dearest Charlie, in an entire year—two\r\n    from Lyons, and one from Paris—to cheer my regrets in being\r\n    separated from you! If I were to take this as the measure of\r\n    your love for me, I should indeed have reason to be sad. But I\r\n    have abundant other proofs of your feelings in my regard; and\r\n    at all events, I am not one who can afford to be too rigid in\r\n    insisting upon the frequency of correspondence, unless I wish\r\n    to furnish grave grounds of complaint against myself.\r\n\r\n    Few, however, as your letters have been, I am deeply grateful\r\n    for their warm and affectionate sentiments, which carry with\r\n    them such an evidence of sincerity as to leave me, even when\r\n    you do not write, no ground for doubting what your feelings\r\n    still are towards me. I am not sure whether in your regard I\r\n    shall be equally fortunate; for I am fully sensible that I have\r\n    not the power of infusing into what I write all the warmth and\r\n    sincerity that I really feel. However, you are not dependent\r\n    on my words, in order to be satisfied of the truth of my\r\n    affection; and, knowing it as you do, even a lesser token of it\r\n    than this will suffice to convince you.\r\n\r\n    I am still here at Bologna following the same old round of\r\n    occupations. Nor am I dissatisfied with my lot, for I am quite\r\n    sensible of my inability to take a loftier flight. I feel that\r\n    the shade suits me best. Were I to go to Paris, I should be\r\n    obliged to set myself up upon some candlestick, where I should\r\n    only give out a faint and flickering gleam, which would soon\r\n    die utterly away. Nevertheless I am not the less grateful for\r\n    your advice; though I perceive that you are dissatisfied with\r\n    me because I am such a little fellow.\r\n\r\n    A thousand, thousand greetings to your dear little sisters.\r\n    Renew my remembrance to your father, and when you have an\r\n    occasional moment of leisure from your tasks, pray bestow it\r\n    upon\r\n\r\n                          Your sincere friend,\r\n\r\n                                               D. JOSEPH MEZZOFANTI.\r\n\r\nBesides the unaffected modesty and the distrust of his own fitness for\r\na prominent position (even with such advantages as those offered to him\r\nat Paris,) which are expressed in this letter, the Abate Mezzofanti\r\nwas also moved to decline the invitation, both by affection for his\r\nnative city and love of its university life (to which we shall find him\r\nlooking back with fondness even after his elevation to the cardinalate,)\r\nand by unwillingness to part from his family, to whom he was tenderly\r\nattached. To the latter he had always felt himself bound by duty as well\r\nas by affection. The expense of the education of his sister’s children,\r\nwho at this time, (as appears from a little Memoir in the archives of\r\nthe University drawn up in 1815,) were seven in number, amounted to a\r\nconsiderable sum. They, as well as their parents, still continued to\r\nreside in his house; and the same Memoir alludes to another near relative\r\nwho was at least partially dependent upon him for support.\r\n\r\nTo these children, indeed, he was as a father. Cavaliere Minarelli, in\r\nthe interesting note already cited, describes him as “most affectionately\r\ndevoted to them, and uniting in his manners the loving familiarity of\r\na friend with the graver authority of an instructor.” In his brief\r\nintervals of leisure from business or study, he often joined them in\r\ntheir little amusements. Without the slightest trace of austerity,\r\nhe generally managed to give their amusements, as far as possible, a\r\nreligious character. He usually made the festivals memorable to them by\r\nsome extra indulgence or entertainment. He encouraged and directed their\r\nchildish tastes in the embellishment of their little oratories, or in\r\nthose well-known Christmas devices of Catholic children, the preparation\r\nof the “Crib of the Infant Jesus,” or the decoration of the “Christmas\r\nTree.” He hoarded his little resources in order to procure for them\r\nimproving and instructive books. He composed simple odes and sonnets for\r\nthe several festivals, which it was his greatest enjoyment to hear them\r\nrecite. The simplicity of his disposition, and a natural fondness for\r\nchildren which was one of the characteristics even of his later life,\r\nmade all this easy to him. He was always ready, if not to take a part, at\r\nleast to manifest an interest, in the pleasures of his young friends. In\r\nthe carnival especially, when amusement seems, for a time, to form the\r\nserious business of every Italian household, he was never wanting; and,\r\non one memorable occasion, he actually composed a little comedy, to be\r\nacted by his nephews and nieces for the humble family circle.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole winter of 1806-7 his time was still occupied in the\r\nuncongenial labour of compiling the Catalogue.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of September, he writes to the Abate De Rossi, apologizing\r\nfor delay in replying to a letter received from him.\r\n\r\n    “A complication of unfortunate accidents has, up to this\r\n    moment, prevented me from answering your kind letter of last\r\n    July. My poor mother has frequently, during the summer, been\r\n    in extreme danger of death. My own chest, too, has more than\r\n    once been threatened, and is still far from strong. All this,\r\n    however, does not save me from a feeling of remorse at having\r\n    been so tardy towards one whose scientific reputation, as well\r\n    as his courteous manners, entitle him to so much consideration.\r\n    My labour, as you say, is not yet over. The task, as I\r\n    had indeed anticipated from the beginning, has proved an\r\n    exceedingly difficult one. As an evidence of the difficulty I\r\n    need only mention that the celebrated Giuseppe Assemani, in\r\n    the similar work which he undertook,[336] has made numerous\r\n    mistakes, having in one instance given no less than six\r\n    different titles to seven copies of the same work. This great\r\n    orientalist, with all his learning, could not command the time\r\n    necessary for so troublesome a task as that of ascertaining the\r\n    titles and authors of books which are quite unknown and often\r\n    imperfect. For my part, I resolved from the beginning that I\r\n    would not, willingly at least, add to the other deficiencies of\r\n    which I am conscious, that of haste and insufficient time. _Nam\r\n    quo minus ingenio possum, subsidio mihi diligentiam comparavi_;\r\n    and the condescension of his Serene Highness has in the end\r\n    relieved me, by extending until April the time allowed for the\r\n    completion of the task. The grammarians, rhetoricians, poets,\r\n    prosodians, logicians, and theologians, have taken up all my\r\n    time hitherto; in the course of the next two months, I hope to\r\n    complete the enumeration of the other authors; and then I shall\r\n    at last fulfil my promise of sending you, when occasion serves,\r\n    whatever I think may interest you.”\r\n\r\nDe Rossi, in his letter, to which this is a reply, had put some\r\nquestions regarding the contents of the octavo edition of D’Herbelot’s\r\n_Bibliothèque Orientale_, the preface of which had contained a promise\r\nof many important improvements. Mezzofanti, referring to these promised\r\nadditions, goes on to say, “In the articles which I have compared, I\r\nhave only found a few verbal corrections. But in the preface, we are\r\npromised additional articles, drawn from the narratives of travellers\r\nsubsequent to D’Herbelot. From this promise you will be able to infer\r\nwhat information you may expect to derive from the edition, and whether\r\nit is likely to be useful for your purpose. I have not yet received\r\nthe supplement, which was to contain certain articles which have been\r\npostponed for reasons explained in the preface. Perhaps the reason of its\r\nnot having been printed, may be, that the articles in question, being of\r\nuse to orientalists alone, may be found by them in the former editions.\r\n\r\n“As it would be no small distinction for the collection of Oriental MSS.\r\nbelonging to this Royal Library of ours, if among them there should be\r\nfound any deserving of a place amongst the MSS. cited in your dictionary,\r\nI shall endeavour, in the hope that it may prove so, to complete my task\r\nas speedily as possible, so as to send you at least an index, out of\r\nwhich you may yourself choose the name of any author whom you shall judge\r\ndeserving of notice.\r\n\r\n“I believe Dombay’s work has been published. I have the title,\r\n‘_Geschichte der Mauritan. Könige; aus dem Arabischen übersetzt_’;[337]\r\nbut without date or place. I shall write to Vienna as soon as I can, to\r\norder it, if it should be published. I have made a good many interesting\r\nacquisitions lately; as for instance, _Albucasis ‘De Chirurgia.’_[338]\r\nOxonii, 1778. ‘_Maured Allatafet Jemaleddini filii Togri Bardii; seu\r\nRerum Aegyptiacarum Annales ab Anno C. 971 ad 1453_’;[339] several\r\n‘_Anthologias_’ and ‘_Chrestomathias_;’ one of which, that of Rink and\r\nVater, has at the end a _Bibliotheca Arabica_ continued up to 1802; and\r\nsome other books.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt this date, Mezzofanti’s correspondence with De Rossi is interrupted;\r\nand, although there appears to have been a pretty regular interchange of\r\ncorrespondence between them for some years longer,[340] no further letter\r\nhas been found among those of De Rossi’s papers which are deposited in\r\nthe library of Parma, except one written in the year 1812.\r\n\r\nScanty as are the details supplied by those which are preserved, they,\r\nat least, afford some insight into the process by which the writer’s\r\nextraordinary faculty was developed and perfected. However acute and\r\nalmost instinctive this faculty may have been, it is plain from these\r\nletters, that it was at this time most systematically and laboriously\r\ncultivated. However much Mezzofanti may have owed to nature, it is\r\ncertain, that for all the practical results of his great natural gifts\r\nhe was indebted to his own patient and almost plodding industry; and\r\nit may cheer the humble student in the long and painful course through\r\nwhich alone he can aspire to success, to find that even this prodigy of\r\nlanguage was forced to tread the same laborious path;—to see the anxious\r\ncare with which he collected and consulted grammars, dictionaries,\r\nmanuals, reading books, and other similar commonplace appliances of the\r\nstudy; and to learn, that, with all his unquestioned and unquestionable\r\ngenius, he did not consider himself above the drudgery at which even less\r\ngifted students are but too apt to murmur or repine.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that the toilsome practice of writing out translations\r\nfrom one language into another which these letters disclose, was\r\ncontinued by Mezzofanti through his entire career of study, although in\r\nhis latter years he pursued it more as an amusement than as a serious\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nIt is hard, in ordinary cases, to infer from such performances the exact\r\ndegree of proficiency in the language which they should be presumed\r\nto indicate. Some translations are only the fruit of long and careful\r\nstudy.[341] On the contrary, there are instances on record in which\r\nexcellent translations have been produced by persons possessing a very\r\nslight knowledge of the original. Thus Monte, the author of the best\r\nItalian translation of Homer, was utterly unacquainted with Greek;[342]\r\nHalley, without knowing a word of Arabic, was able to guess his way,\r\n(partly by mathematical reasoning, partly by the aid of a Latin version,\r\nwhich, however, only contained about one-tenth of the entire work,)\r\nthrough an Arabic translation of Apollonius _De Sectione Rationis_;[343]\r\nand M. Arnaud, the first French translator of Lalla Rookh, did not know a\r\nword of the English language.[344]\r\n\r\nBut on all these points Mezzofanti’s fame is beyond suspicion. His\r\ntranslations, at least in his later life, were at once produced with\r\nthe utmost freedom and rapidity, and are universally acknowledged to\r\nhave been models of verbal correctness; and in most instances where the\r\nsame passage is translated into many languages, the versions display a\r\nremarkable mastery over the peculiar forms and idioms of each.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful success must be ascribed, no doubt, to his early and\r\nsystematic exercise in translation, of which the specimen submitted to De\r\nRossi is but one example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n[1807-1814.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Catalogue Raisonné_ of the Oriental and Greek manuscripts was not\r\ncompleted until 1807, having thus absorbed the greater part of Abate\r\nMezzofanti’s time during two years.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the Oriental MSS. had never even been entered upon\r\nthe ordinary library catalogue, and no attempt at all had been made\r\nto describe them accurately, much less to register their character or\r\ncontents. Very many of them too, as we learn from Mezzofanti’s letters,\r\nwere imperfect; and a still more considerable number wanted at least the\r\ntitle and the name of the author. It was no trivial labour, therefore,\r\nto examine the entire collection; to decide on the name, the age, and\r\nthe authorship of each; to describe their contents; and to reduce them\r\nall into their respective classes. For most of these particulars the\r\ncompiler of the catalogue was utterly without a guide. It is true that\r\nJoseph Assemani’s catalogue of the Oriental MSS. of the Vatican, and\r\nthe catalogue of those of the Medicean Library at Florence by his\r\nnephew Stephen Evodius, were in some cases available. But many of the\r\nBologna MSS. are not to be found in either catalogue; and for all these\r\nMezzofanti was of course compelled to rely altogether on his own lights.\r\n\r\nThe catalogue, as drawn up by him, is still preserved, and,\r\nnotwithstanding these disadvantages, is described as a highly creditable\r\nperformance, and “a valuable supplement to the labours of Talmar and\r\nthe Assemanis;”[345] and at all events it was to his long and laborious\r\nresearches while engaged in its preparation, that he owed that minute\r\nfamiliarity with the whole literature of the East, ancient and modern,\r\nwhich, as we shall see, was a subject of wonder even to learned orientals\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1807, an opportunity occurred for testing practically\r\nhow far the reputation which he had acquired corresponded with his real\r\nattainments. On the outbreak of hostilities between the Porte and Russia\r\nin that year, the Russian ambassador, Italinski, withdrew (not without\r\nsome risk and difficulty)[346] from Constantinople, and, being conveyed\r\non board the British ship of war, Canopus, to Malta, afterwards made his\r\nway to Ancona. While the ambassador remained at Ancona, the chancellor of\r\nthe embassy, Angelo Timoni, who was of Bolognese origin, came to visit\r\nhis native city; accompanied by Matteo Pisani, the official interpreter,\r\nwho was one of the best linguists of his time, and especially a perfect\r\nmaster of all the modern languages of the East. As they resided, during\r\ntheir stay at Bologna, in the house of his friend, Dr. Santagata, their\r\nvisit was a severe ordeal for Mezzofanti, who was constantly in their\r\nsociety; but he withstood it triumphantly; and Santagata records their\r\nwonder and delight to find that, without ever having visited the East,\r\nor mixed in Oriental society, the Bolognese professor had nevertheless\r\nattained a “mastery over the many and various languages, especially\r\nOriental ones, in which they tried him, and that the marvellous and all\r\nbut inconceivable accounts which they had received regarding him, proved\r\nto be not only credible but actually true.”[347]\r\n\r\nA great and lasting mortification nevertheless soon afterwards befel\r\nMezzofanti, in the unexpected deprivation of his beloved professorship.\r\nThe circumstances which accompanied his removal have not been fully\r\ndetailed, but there is enough in the history of the period to supply an\r\nintelligible explanation. The conflict of Napoleon with the Holy See\r\nwas just then approaching its crisis. From the beginning of this year\r\nthe French troops had occupied Rome. Two cardinal secretaries of state\r\nhad been forcibly ejected from office. The Pope was a prisoner in his\r\nown palace and his authority was completely superseded. Now upon these\r\nand the many similar outrages to which the venerable Pontiff was daily\r\nsubjected, the opinions of Mezzofanti were no secret; and there can be\r\nno doubt that the determination of the Government to remove him from\r\nthe university was mainly influenced by this knowledge; although in\r\ndeference to public opinion, and to the universal feeling of respect\r\nwith which he was regarded, they abstained from formally depriving him\r\nof his professorship. His removal was effected indirectly by a decree,\r\ndated November 15, 1808, by which the Oriental professorship itself was\r\nsuppressed.\r\n\r\nAlthough a pension, and as it would seem, not a very illiberal one,\r\nwas assigned to him, he felt very deeply this exclusion from a career\r\nso congenial to his tastes. He continued nevertheless, as before, to\r\ninstruct pupils privately in these and other languages; and although, as\r\nto details, the history of his own studies at this time is a complete\r\nblank, yet from his known habits it may reasonably be presumed that when\r\nthe first feeling of mortification had subsided, the ultimate result of\r\nhis release from the duties of his chair, was to direct his untiring\r\nenergies into new fields of research; and it seems to have been during\r\nthis interval that he first gave his attention to the Sanscrit and other\r\nIndian languages;—a family which had till then been but little cultivated\r\nexcept in England, but to whose vast importance, as well as widely\r\nextended philological relations, Frederic Schlegel[348] had just awakened\r\nthe attention of the learned throughout continental Europe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the date of this second deprivation, till the year 1812, his quiet\r\nand uniform course of life presents hardly a single interesting incident.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1810, his mother died. But her advanced age and infirm health\r\nhad long prepared him for this bereavement. She died on the feast of St.\r\nAloysius (June 21,) in her seventy-third year.\r\n\r\nThe only detail regarding his personal occupations, which I have been\r\nable to discover, is derived from a letter, dated November 30th,\r\n1811,[349] to his friend Pezzana, at Parma, which exhibits him again\r\nengaged in the drudgery of compiling a catalogue—that of the library\r\nof Count Marescalchi. Pezzana had published, some time before, a short\r\nbibliographical essay on two very rare editions of Petrarch, which are\r\nstill preserved in the Parma Collection. Mezzofanti, while engaged in\r\ncataloguing the Marescalchi library, discovered a copy of one of these\r\neditions, and at once wrote to communicate the fact to Pezzana.\r\n\r\nI may also mention, what, in a life so uneventful, must claim to be\r\nregarded as an event—a short journey which he made to Modena and Mantua.\r\nJoseph Minarelli, the eldest of his sister’s sons, was summoned to\r\nModena in 1813, to ballot in the conscription which followed the terrible\r\ncampaign of 1812, so fatal to the armies of France. Signora Minarelli\r\nwas naturally much alarmed at the chance of her son’s being drawn in the\r\nconscription, and in consideration for her anxiety, his uncle accompanied\r\nhim to Modena upon the occasion.\r\n\r\nIt becomes especially difficult henceforward to follow the history of his\r\nstudies. The literary friends of this part of his career;—his colleagues\r\nin the University; Ranzani; Caturegli, the astronomer; the eminent\r\nbotanist, Felippo Re; his fellow-pupil and fellow-teacher, Clotilda\r\nTambroni; Schiassi; Magistrini; and others of less note, who could have\r\nsupplied information, not only as to his habits and pursuits, but as to\r\nthe actual stages of his progress, are long since dead. The letters of\r\nPietro Giordani,[350] however, recently published, may, in some measure,\r\nfill up the blank; not, it is true, as to the details of his biography,\r\nbut at least in so far as regards the opinion entertained in Bologna of\r\nhis character and acquirements. Indeed the testimony of Giordani is less\r\nopen to exception than any which could have emanated from the personal\r\nfriends of Mezzofanti. Giordani had entered the Benedictine congregation,\r\nand had even received the order of sub-deaconship; but on the outbreak\r\nof the Revolution, he had renounced the monastic life, cast aside the\r\nBenedictine habit, and thrown himself into the arms of the revolutionary\r\nparty in Italy. Under the French rule at Bologna, he obtained as the\r\nreward of his principles, the place of Assistant Librarian, and also that\r\nof Deputy Professor of Latin and Italian Eloquence. Hence it will easily\r\nbe believed that his relations with the Papal party in the University\r\nwere by no means friendly; and, as he had had with the Abate Mezzofanti\r\nhimself (as I learn from an interesting letter of M. Libri which shall be\r\ninserted hereafter,) some personal misunderstandings, he may be presumed\r\nto have been but little disposed to over-rate the qualifications of an\r\nantagonist. It is no mean evidence of Mezzofanti’s merit, therefore, that\r\nGiordani has specially excepted him from the very disparaging estimate\r\nwhich he expresses regarding the literary men of Italy at this time.\r\n“I have held but little intercourse with literary men,” he writes to\r\nhis friend Lazzaro Papi, “finding them commonly possessed of but little\r\nlearning and a great deal of passion. Here, however, I have met an\r\nexception to the rule—the Abate Mezzofanti—a man not only of the utmost\r\npiety, but of attainments truly wonderful and all but beyond belief. You\r\nmust, of course, have heard of him; but indeed he well deserves a wider\r\nfame than he enjoys, for the number of languages which he knows most\r\nperfectly, although this is the least part of his learning. Nevertheless,\r\nsuch is his excessive modesty, that he lives here in obscurity, and I\r\nmust add, to the disgrace of the age, in poverty.”[351]\r\n\r\nNor is Giordani’s report to be regarded as one of those vague panegyrics,\r\nwhich, when Mezzofanti’s fame was established, each new visitor was\r\nwont to re-echo. Giordani is not only well-known as one of the purest\r\nItalian writers of the century, but enjoyed the highest reputation as a\r\ncritical scholar; and the subject on which, in another of his letters,\r\nhe defers to the judgment of Mezzofanti—a delicate question of Greek\r\ncriticism—was precisely that on which he himself was best qualified to\r\npronounce. In a letter to the Abate Canova (Feb 3, 1812,) he mentions a\r\nconjecture that had recently interested him very much; viz., that the\r\ngreat Roman architect, Vitruvius, was a Greek, although he wrote in\r\nLatin. His chief argument is based upon Vitruvius’s Latinity, in which\r\nhe detects traces of foreign idiom. But, lest he should yield too much\r\nto fancy, he had appealed to the judgment of some of his colleagues, and\r\nhe communicates the result to his correspondent. One of the persons thus\r\nconsulted was Mezzofanti. “I should not rely on my own judgment,” says\r\nGiordani, “had I not convinced Cicognara and Mezzofanti that it is right.\r\nThe authority of the latter is the more important, because my argument\r\nrests chiefly on the style, in every line of which I find impressed, even\r\nwhere the subject is not technical, traces of halting [_storpiato_] and\r\nill-translated Greek; and you know what a judge Mezzofanti is of this\r\npoint.”[352]\r\n\r\nIn a letter to another friend, Count Leopoldo Cicognara, (since known\r\nas the biographer of Canova)[353] Giordani reports the sequel of this\r\ndiscussion, which confirms in a very remarkable manner, Giordani’s\r\njudgment of Mezzofanti’s critical sagacity. Mezzofanti had at first\r\nassented to Giordani’s conjecture; but on a closer examination he\r\ndiscovered, that what Giordani had considered the Grecisms of Vitruvius’s\r\nstyle, were, in reality, but _translations from various Greek authors_,\r\nfrom whom Vitruvius largely borrows, and whom he actually enumerates in\r\nthe preface of the seventh book. Mezzofanti further pointed out a phrase\r\nin the same preface which at once put an end to the discussion, and the\r\ndiscovery of which, as Giordani justly observes, in itself “indicated an\r\ninquiring and critical mind.” Vitruvius, in speaking of the Latin writers\r\nupon his art, as contradistinguished from the Greek, calls them “antiqui\r\n_nostri_.”[354]\r\n\r\nTo the same friend, Count Cicognara, Giordani in a previous letter,\r\ndated January 30th, 1812, had written of Mezzofanti’s own peculiar\r\nfaculty of languages, in terms of almost rapturous admiration. “You\r\nknow Mezzofanti,” he says;—“Mezzofanti—the rarest, most unheard of,\r\nmost inconceivable of living men. I call him, and he is, the man of all\r\nnations and all ages. By Jove! he appears as though he had been born in\r\nthe beginning of the world, and, like St. Anthony, had lived in every\r\nage and in every country!”[355]\r\n\r\nIn connexion with this very remarkable testimony to the accuracy of\r\nMezzofanti’s knowledge of Greek, I may mention (although it more properly\r\nbelongs to a later period of his life) an amusing anecdote illustrative\r\nof his accomplishments as a Latinist, which is recorded by Dr. Santagata,\r\nand the hero of which was M. Bucheron, Professor of Latin Literature\r\nin the University of Turin, and one of the most celebrated classical\r\nphilologists of modern Italy. M. Bucheron came to Bologna, from some\r\ncause strongly prepossessed against Mezzofanti, and disposed to regard\r\nhim in the light of a mere literary charlatan, of showy but superficial\r\nacquirements. Of his Latinity—especially in all that bears upon the\r\ncritical niceties of the language, and the numberless philological\r\nquestions regarding it which have arisen among modern scholars, M.\r\nBucheron entertained the lowest possible estimate;—considering it, in\r\ntruth, impossible, that one whose attention had been divided over so many\r\nlanguages as fame ascribed to Mezzofanti, _could be_ solidly grounded\r\nin any of them. He resolved, therefore, to put the Abate’s Latinity\r\nto a rigorous test; and came to the library prepared with a number of\r\nquestions, bearing upon the niceties of the Latin language, which he\r\nproposed to introduce, as it were casually, in his expected conversation.\r\nHe was presented to Mezzofanti by his friend, Michele Ferrucci, Librarian\r\nof the University of Pisa, from whom, I may add, Dr. Santagata received\r\nthe account of their interview. The conversation, as Bucheron had\r\npre-determined, began upon some common-place subject: but in a short time\r\nhe artfully contrived to turn it upon those topics on which he desired\r\nto probe his companion. The trial was a most animated one. From a series\r\nof obscure and difficult questions of Latin philology, they passed to a\r\nvariety of oriental, historical, and archæological topics. At the moment\r\nwhen the interest of the conversation was at its very height, Ferrucci\r\nwas unfortunately called away by business; but the result may be judged\r\nfrom the sequel. On his return, after a somewhat lengthened absence, he\r\nmet Bucheron coming from the Library.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, “what do you think of Mezzofanti?”\r\n\r\n“_Per Bacco!_” replied the astounded Piedmontese. “_Per Bacco! é il\r\nDiavolo!_”[356]\r\n\r\nHis celebrity, indeed, was by this time universally established. With all\r\nhis unaffected humility; with the full consciousness (which he expressed\r\nin all simplicity and truth to his young friend, Carlino Marescalchi)\r\nthat he was “best fitted for the shade”—he had insensibly grown into\r\none of the notabilities of Bologna. He was constantly visited and\r\nconsulted, especially by Oriental students, from foreign countries. What\r\nis more remarkable, more than one Jewish scholar appears in the record\r\nof his visitors. Among the papers of the Abate De Rossi is a letter\r\nof this period (March 18th, 1812,) in which Mezzofanti introduces to\r\nhim a certain “Signor Moise Ber;” and, notwithstanding the variety of\r\northography, (a variety quite natural in an Italian letter,) there can be\r\nno doubt that this Signor Moise Ber was no other than Rabbi Moses Beer\r\nof the Israelite University of Rome, whose Orations and Discourses have\r\nsince been published.[357]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMezzofanti’s opportunities of conversing with foreigners were much\r\nincreased by his becoming permanently attached to the Library of the\r\nUniversity (with which the Library of the Institute had been incorporated\r\nby the French) as Deputy-Librarian. This appointment he received on the\r\n28th of March, in 1812. As the chief librarian at this time was the\r\nAbate Pozzetti, who, like Mezzofanti, was an honorary professor of the\r\nUniversity, and one of his most valued friends, the appointment was\r\nespecially agreeable to him: and, independently of its other advantages,\r\nit became for him, as I said, from the constant passing and re-passing of\r\nstrangers from every country, a school in which he was able to exercise\r\nhimself, almost hourly, in every department of his multilingual studies.\r\n\r\nThe late Lord Guilford, who was Chancellor of the University of Corfu,\r\nmade his acquaintance during one of his visits to Bologna; and on every\r\nsubsequent occasion on which he passed through that city, Mezzofanti was\r\ninvariably his guest, accompanied by all the Greeks who chanced to be at\r\nthe time students of the University.\r\n\r\nAs his reputation extended, the literary societies of the various cities\r\nof Italy were naturally desirous to number him among their members. He\r\nwas already an associate of the _Societá Colombina_ at Florence, and of\r\nthe “Society of Letters, Sciences, and Arts,” at Leghorn; and he received\r\nabout this time, the decoration of the Royal Order of the Two Sicilies.\r\nThe only literary society, however, in whose proceedings he took an\r\nactive part, was the Scientific Academy of the Institute of his native\r\ncity. It has been commonly supposed that he rarely, if at all, appeared\r\nin the literary arena, and it is true that he has not left behind him\r\nanything at all commensurate with his reputation; but he frequently read\r\npapers, chiefly on philological subjects, in the Bolognese Academy. The\r\nfirst of these which is noticed by Dr. Santagata was read on the 22nd of\r\nJuly, 1813; and another, “On the Symbolic Paintings of the Mexicans,” was\r\ndelivered in the following session, on the 23rd of March, 1814. Owing\r\nto his early association with several ex-Jesuit American Missionaries\r\nwho had settled in Bologna, he had long felt an interest in the curious\r\nsubject of Mexican Antiquities. Among his MSS., which still remain in the\r\npossession of the Cavaliere Minarelli at Bologna, is a Mexican Calendar,\r\ndrawn up by Mezzofanti’s own hand, and illustrated with fac-similes of\r\nthe original pictures and symbolical representations from the pencil of\r\nhis niece, Signora Anna Minarelli; but of the paper read in the Academy,\r\nno trace has been found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n[1814-1817.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1814, so memorable in general history, was also an important one\r\nin the humble fortunes of the Abate Mezzofanti.\r\n\r\nThe success of the papal cause in Italy naturally opened a new career to\r\nthe men against whom fidelity to the papal interest had long closed the\r\nordinary avenues to distinction.\r\n\r\nIn the close of 1813, the reverses, which, from the disastrous Russian\r\nexpedition, had succeeded each other with startling rapidity, at length\r\nforced upon Napoleon the conviction that he had overcalculated the\r\nendurance of the people of France. He now learned, when too late, that\r\nthe reckless expenditure of human blood with which his splendid successes\r\nwere purchased, had brought sorrow and suffering to every fireside in\r\nevery hamlet through his wide empire, and that the enormous levies which\r\nhe still continued to demand, and which were called out only to perish\r\nin the fruitless contest with his destiny, consummated the popular\r\ndiscontent. No longer, therefore, in a position to brave the public\r\nreprobation with which his treatment of Pius VII. had been visited,\r\nhe found it necessary to restore the semblance of those more friendly\r\nrelations which he had maintained with him in the less openly ambitious\r\nstage of his career. Accordingly, although among the provisions of the\r\nextorted Concordat of Fontainebleau, there was none to which Napoleon,\r\nin his secret heart, clung more tenaciously than the renunciation which\r\nit implied on the part of the Pontiff of the sovereignty of Rome, he\r\nfound it necessary, notwithstanding, to yield so far to public sympathy\r\nas to issue an order for the Pope’s immediate return to Italy, dated the\r\n22nd of January, 1814. This measure, nevertheless, had evidently been\r\nextorted from his fears; and, as he desired nothing from it beyond the\r\neffect which he expected it to produce on the public mind, he contrived\r\nthat upon various pretences the Pope’s progress should be interrupted\r\nand delayed. For a short time, too, the varying success with which the\r\nmemorable campaign of 1814 commenced; the opening of the Congress of\r\nChatillon; the conclusion of the armistice of Lusigny;—all served to\r\nre-animate his sinking hopes. Thus the Pope was detained day after day,\r\nweek after week, in the south of France, until the close of the Emperor’s\r\ndeath struggle, by the capitulation of Paris; when Pius VII. was at\r\nlength set free to return to his capital, by an order of the provisional\r\ngovernment, dated the 2nd of April, 1814.\r\n\r\nWithin a few days after the communication of this order, Pius VII.\r\nreached Bologna. Among the ecclesiastics who there hastened to offer\r\nhomage to their restored sovereign, there were few who could approach\r\nhis throne with a fuller consciousness of unsullied loyalty, or who could\r\npresent more unequivocal evidences of the truth and sincerity of the\r\nallegiance which they tendered, than the ex-Professor Mezzofanti, driven\r\nfrom his chair because he refused to compromise his loyalty even by an\r\nindirect recognition of the Anti-Papal government, and only restored,\r\nwhen, after the concordat of 1801, the occupation of the Legations had\r\nbeen acquiesced in by the Pontificial government itself, he had a second\r\ntime suffered the penalty of loyalty in a similar deprivation. It will\r\neasily be believed, therefore, that, in the more than gracious reception\r\naccorded to him by the Pontiff, a feeling of grateful recognition of\r\nhis fidelity and of sympathy with the sacrifices which he had made, was\r\nmingled with undisguised admiration of his talents and acquirements.\r\n\r\nHence the first impulse of this munificent pope was to attach to his\r\nown immediate service a scholar who was at once eminent for learning,\r\ndistinguished by piety, by priestly zeal, and by loyalty in the hour of\r\ntrial, unstained even by the slightest compromise. The re-construction of\r\nthe various Roman tribunals and congregations which, during the captivity\r\nof the Pope and Cardinals, had been, for the most part, suspended,\r\nsuggested an opportunity of employing, with marked advantage for the\r\npublic service, the peculiar talents which seemed almost idly wasted in\r\nthe obscurity of a provincial capital. The halls and public offices of\r\nRome had been the school or the arena of all the celebrated linguists of\r\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; and the very constitution of\r\nthe congregation and college, “De Propaganda Fide,” appeared specially to\r\ninvite the services of one so eminent in that department. Accordingly,\r\nPius VII. surprised the modest Abate by an invitation to accompany him\r\nto Rome, and proposed for his acceptance the important office of the\r\nsecretaryship of the Propaganda[358]—one of those so called _poste\r\ncardinalizie_, which constitute the first step in the career towards the\r\ncardinalate.\r\n\r\nMezzofanti was deeply affected by this mark of the favour and confidence\r\nof his sovereign. Independently, too, of these flattering considerations,\r\nand of the advantages of rank and fortune which it involved, the mere\r\nresidence in Rome, and especially in the Propaganda—the great polyglot\r\ncentre of the ancient and modern world—had many attractions for a\r\nstudent of language so enthusiastic and indefatigable. It was a proud\r\nthought, moreover, to follow in the track of Ubicini, and Giorgi, and\r\nPiromalli, and the Assemani’s. But his modesty was proof against all\r\nthese temptations. He shrank from the responsibility which this great\r\noffice involved;—and, with the every expression of gratitude for so\r\ndistinguished an honour, he declined to exchange the quiet and seclusion\r\nof his life at Bologna, for the more brilliant, but far more anxious\r\nposition held out for his acceptance at Rome.\r\n\r\nNot content, however, with personal solicitations, the Pope employed\r\nCardinal Consalvi to use his influence with Mezzofanti. But it was to no\r\npurpose. The humble Abate could not be induced to leave his native city.\r\nThe only mark of favour, therefore, which remained at the disposal of\r\nthe pontiff, was one which Mezzofanti prized infinitely beyond the more\r\nsolid, as well as more brilliant, offer which awaited him at Rome,—his\r\nre-establishment in the Professorship of Oriental Languages. He was\r\nformally restored on the 28th of April, 1814,[359] a few days after the\r\ndeparture of the Pope from Bologna.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that on this occasion, as on that of his declining\r\nthe invitation to Paris several years earlier, he was much influenced\r\nby those considerations, arising from his relations to the children of\r\nhis sister, to which I already alluded, his presence in Bologna being\r\nnow more than ever necessary for the completion of their education.\r\nIndeed this was now the chief family duty which bound him to Bologna; for\r\nhis father, who had survived his mother by several years, died, at the\r\nadvanced age of eighty-one, in April, 1814, during the visit of Pius VII.\r\nto that city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe few notices of the Abate Mezzofanti which we have met up to\r\nthis period, are derived almost exclusively from Bolognese, or at\r\nleast Italian sources. During the long continental war, the ordinary\r\nintercourse with Italy was, in great part, suspended, and few tourists,\r\nespecially of the literary class, visited the north of Italy. But the\r\ncessation of hostilities in the spring of 1814, re-opened the long\r\ninterrupted communication, and the annual stream of visitors to Rome\r\nand Naples again began to flow, with its wonted regularity, through the\r\ncities of the north. Few of the tourists who published an account of\r\ntheir travels at this date failed to devote some of their pages to one\r\nwho had now become one of the chief “sights” of his native city. It is\r\nhardly necessary to say, that, in some instances, these accounts are but\r\nthe echoes of popular fame, and exhibit the usual amount of ignorance,\r\ncredulity, and superficial information, which characterise “travellers’\r\ntales.” But very many, also, will be found to contain the judgment of\r\nacute, learned, and impartial observers; many of them are the result\r\nof a careful and jealous scrutiny of Mezzofanti’s attainments, made by\r\ncritics of indisputable capacity; most of them will be admitted to be of\r\nunquestionable value, as to one point at least—Mezzofanti’s familiarity\r\nwith the native language of each particular traveller; and all, even the\r\nleast solid among them, are interesting, as presenting to us, with the\r\nfreshness of contemporary narrative, the actual impressions received by\r\nthe writer from his opportunities of personal intercourse with the great\r\nlinguist.\r\n\r\nI have collected from many sources, published[360] and unpublished,\r\na variety of these travellers’ notices, which I shall use freely in\r\nillustrating the narrative of the remaining years of the life of\r\nMezzofanti. I shall be careful, however, in all that regards the critical\r\nportion of the biography, and especially in estimating the actual\r\nextent of Mezzofanti’s linguistic attainments, only to rely, for each\r\nlanguage, on the authority of one who, either as a native, or at least an\r\nunquestioned proficient in that particular language, will be admitted to\r\nbe a perfectly competent judge in its regard.\r\n\r\nThe autumn of the year 1814 supplies one such notice, which is\r\nremarkable, as the first direct testimony to Mezzofanti’s proficiency\r\nin speaking German. He had learned this language in boyhood; and it is\r\nclear from his letters to De Rossi, and from the books to which he freely\r\nrefers in that correspondence, that he was intimately acquainted with it\r\nas a language of books. But in this year we are able for the first time\r\nto test his power of speaking German by the judgment of a native.\r\n\r\nThe writer in question is a German tourist, named Kephalides, professor\r\nin the University of Breslau,[361] who (as may be inferred from his\r\nalluding to the Congress of Vienna, as just opened) visited Bologna\r\nin the October or November of 1814. “The Professor Abate Mezzofanti,”\r\nwrites this traveller, who met him in the Library, “speaks German with\r\nextraordinary fluency, although he has never been out of Bologna. He is a\r\nwarm admirer, too, of the literature of Germany, especially its poetry;\r\nand he has stirred up the same enthusiasm among the educated classes in\r\nBologna, both gentlemen and ladies.”[362] We learn incidentally, too,\r\nfrom this writer’s narrative, that German was among the languages which\r\nMezzofanti taught to his private pupils. In a rather interesting account\r\nof an interview which he had with old Father Emmanuel Aponte, (one of\r\nMezzofanti’s first instructors,) and with the celebrated lady-professor\r\nof Greek, so often referred to, Clotilda Tambroni, Kephalides mentions\r\nthat the youth whom Mezzofanti sent to conduct him to Aponte was one of\r\nhis own pupils, who had just begun to “lisp German.” Strangely enough,\r\nnevertheless, Kephalides does not allude to any other of Mezzofanti’s\r\nlanguages, nor even to his general reputation as a linguist of more than\r\nordinary attainments.\r\n\r\nIn the commencement of the year 1815, the chief Librarianship of the\r\nUniversity became vacant by the death of Father Pompilio Pozzetti.\r\nPozzetti was one of the congregation of the _Scuole Pie_, and in earlier\r\nlife had been Librarian of that Ducal Library at Modena, which Tiraboschi\r\nhas made familiar to every student of Italian literature. From the time\r\nof his appointment as Prefect of the Bologna Library, a close intimacy\r\nhad subsisted between him and Mezzofanti; and on the latter’s being\r\nnamed his assistant, this intimacy ripened into a warm friendship.\r\nMezzofanti was at once appointed as his successor, on the 25th of April,\r\n1815.[363] In the letter in which (May 15th,) he communicated his\r\nappointment to his friend, Pezzana, who held the kindred office at Parma,\r\nhe speaks in terms of the highest praise of his predecessor and of the\r\nservices which he had rendered during his tenure of office, and deplores\r\nhis death as a serious loss to the institution.\r\n\r\nThe revenue of this office, which he held conjointly with his\r\nprofessorship, (although both salaries united amounted to a very\r\nmoderate sum)[364] placed the Abate Mezzofanti in comparatively easy\r\ncircumstances, and for the first time above the actual struggle for\r\ndaily bread. That he still continued, nevertheless, to instruct pupils\r\nin private, need hardly be matter of surprise, when it is remembered\r\nthat, as we have seen, the support of no less than ten individuals was\r\ndependent upon his exertions.[365]\r\n\r\nIndeed, once released from the sordid cares and excessive drudgery of\r\ntuition to which his earlier years had been condemned,—\r\n\r\n    The starving meal, and all the thousand aches\r\n      Which patient merit of the unworthy takes—\r\n\r\nthe exercise of teaching was to him rather an enjoyment than a labour.\r\nAfter his removal to the Vatican Library, and even after his elevation to\r\nthe Cardinalate, we shall find it his chief, if not his only, relaxation.\r\nFew men have possessed in a higher degree the power of winning at\r\nonce the confidence and the love of a pupil. The perfect simplicity\r\nof his character—his exceeding gentleness—the cheerful playfulness of\r\nhis manner—the total absence of any seeming consciousness of superior\r\nattainments—his evident enjoyment of the society of the young, and\r\nabove all the unaffected goodness and kindness of his disposition,\r\nattracted the love of his youthful friends, as much as his marvellous\r\naccomplishments challenged their admiration. It is only just to add that\r\nhe repaid the affection which he thus invariably won from them by the\r\nliveliest interest in all that regarded their progress, and a sincere\r\nconcern for their happiness which followed them in every stage of their\r\nafter life.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, too, he was beginning, in the natural advance of years, to\r\nenjoy the best fruit of the labour of instruction, in the success, and\r\neven distinction, attained by his quondam pupils. One of these to whom he\r\nwas especially attached, the young Marchese Angelelli, had passed through\r\nthe University with much honour; and, in the beginning of 1815, published\r\nanonymously a metrical translation of the Electra of Sophocles, which met\r\nwith very marked favour. Mezzofanti who was much gratified by the success\r\nof this first essay, communicated to his friend Pezzana the secret of\r\nthe authorship. “I send you,” he writes, May 8, 1815, “a first essay in\r\ntranslation from the Greek, published by an able pupil of mine, whose\r\nmodesty has not permitted him to put his name to his work. From you,\r\nhowever, I make no secret of it. The author is one of our young nobles,\r\nthe Marchese Maximilian Francis Angelelli, an indefatigable cultivator\r\nof every liberal study. I may add, as there is no danger of its reaching\r\nthe ears of the modest translator, that this first effort is only the\r\nbeginning of greater things. You will accept a copy for yourself, and\r\nplace the other in your library, which I am happy to know grows daily,\r\nboth in extent and reputation, through the care of its librarian, no less\r\nthan by his distinguished name.”\r\n\r\nThis first essay of the young poet was followed in the next year by\r\na further publication, containing the Electra, the Antigone, and the\r\nTrachiniæ; and, a few years later, his master had the gratification of\r\nwitnessing the successful completion of his favourite pupil’s task,\r\nby the publication of the entire seven tragedies of Sophocles, in\r\n1823-4.[366]\r\n\r\nOne effect of Mezzofanti’s appointment as librarian was to separate him\r\nsomewhat from his sister and her family. He occupied thenceforward the\r\napartments of the librarian in the Palace of the University. But he still\r\ncontinued towards them the same affectionate protection and support.\r\nHitherto he had himself in part superintended or directed the education\r\nof his nephews, and especially of his namesake Joseph, a youth of much\r\npromise, whose diligence and success fully requited his uncle’s care.\r\nJoseph had made choice of the ecclesiastical profession; and, although\r\nfalling far short of his uncle’s extraordinary gift, he became an\r\nexcellent linguist, and was especially distinguished as a Greek and Latin\r\nscholar; so that his uncle had the satisfaction, when his own increasing\r\noccupations compelled him to diminish the number of his pupils, of\r\nfinding the young Minarelli fully competent to undertake a portion of the\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nHis first public appearance at the Academy after he entered upon his new\r\noffice, was for the purpose of reading, (July 11th, 1815,) a paper “On\r\nthe Wallachian Language and its Analogies with Latin;”—a subject which\r\nhas engaged the attention of philologers and historians from the days\r\nof Chalcocondylas, and which involves many interesting ethnological, as\r\nwell as philological considerations.[367] As we shall find him, a few\r\nyears later, astonishing a German visitor by his familiarity with this\r\nout-of-the-way language, it is worth while to note this essay, as an\r\nevidence that here, too, his knowledge was the result of careful study,\r\nand not of casual opportunity, or of sudden inspiration.\r\n\r\nFor a considerable time after he took charge of the Library, he seems\r\nto have been much occupied by his duties in connexion with it. The only\r\nletter which I have been able to obtain about this period, one addressed\r\nto Pezzana, March 5th, 1816, is entirely occupied with details regarding\r\nthe library; and M. Manavit mentions that he not only obtained from the\r\nauthorities a considerable addition to the funds appropriated to the\r\npurchase of books, but, moreover, devoted no trifling share of his own\r\nhumble resources to the same purpose.[368] In the course of a few months,\r\ntoo, he was quite at ease in his new pursuit; and the familiarity with\r\nthe contents of the library, and even of the position of particular books\r\nupon its shelves which he soon possessed, would, in a person of less\r\nprodigious memory, have been a subject of wonder. His nephew, Cavaliere\r\nMinarelli of Bologna, was present on one occasion when Professor Ranzani,\r\nwhile passing an evening in the librarian’s apartments, happened to\r\nrequire some rare volume from the library; and, though it was dark at the\r\ntime, Mezzofanti left the room without a light, proceeded to the library,\r\nand in a few moments returned with the volume required.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1816, Mezzofanti read at the Academy an essay “on the Language\r\nof the Sette Communi at Vicenza,” which has been spoken of with much\r\npraise. This singular community—descended from those stragglers of the\r\ninvading army of Cimbri and Teutones which crossed the Alps in the\r\nyear of Rome, 640, who escaped amid the almost complete extermination\r\nof their companions under Marius, and took refuge in the neighbouring\r\nmountains—presents, (like the similar Roman colony on the Transylvanian\r\nborder,) the strange phenomenon of a foreign race and language preserved\r\nunmixed in the midst of another people and another tongue for a space of\r\nnearly two thousand years. They occupy seven parishes in the vicinity\r\nof Vicenza,[369] whence their name is derived; and they still retain\r\nnot only the tradition of their origin, but the substance, and even the\r\nleading forms of the Teutonic language; insomuch that Frederic IV.,\r\nof Denmark, who visited them in the beginning of the last century,\r\n(1708,) discoursed with them in Danish, and found their idiom perfectly\r\nintelligible.[370]\r\n\r\nThis was a theme peculiarly suited to Mezzofanti’s powers. His essay\r\nexcited considerable interest at the time, but unfortunately was never\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n[1817-1820.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSouthey, in one of his pleasant gossiping letters to Bedford, tells that\r\nwhen M. de Sagrie was going to publish a French translation of Southey’s\r\n“Roderick,” his publisher, Le Bel, insisted upon having a life of the\r\npoet prefixed. M. de Sagrie objected; and at last, in order to get rid of\r\nthe printer’s importunities, said that he knew nothing whatever of the\r\nlife of Mr. Southey. “N’importe!” was the printer’s cool reply, “Ecrivez\r\ntoujours, brodez! Brodez-la un peu; que ce soit vrai ou non, ce ne fait\r\nrien.”[371]\r\n\r\nWe have come to a part of Mezzofanti’s quiet and uniform life in which\r\nthere are so few incidents to break the monotony of the uneventful\r\nnarrative, that, at least in so far as its interest is concerned, his\r\nbiographer is almost in the same condition with M. de Sagrie. The true\r\npurpose of this narrative, however—to exhibit the faculty rather than the\r\nman—seems to me to depend less on the accumulation of piquant anecdotes\r\nand striking adventures, than upon a calm and truthful survey of his\r\nintellectual attainments in the successive stages of his career. Instead,\r\ntherefore, of having recourse to the device suggested by De Sagrie’s\r\nenterprising publisher, and supplying, by a little ingenious “broderie,”\r\nthe deficiency of exciting incident, I shall content myself with weaving\r\ntogether, in the order of time, the several notices of Mezzofanti, by\r\ntravellers and others, which have come within my reach; interspersing\r\nsuch explanations, incidents, illustrations, and anecdotes, as I have\r\nbeen able to glean, among the scanty memorials of this period which\r\nhave survived. Fortunately, from the year which we have now reached,\r\nthere exists a tolerably connected series of such sketches. They are, of\r\ncourse, from the most various hands—from authors\r\n\r\n          of all tongues and creeds;—\r\n    Some were those who counted beads,\r\n    Some of mosque, and some of church,\r\n    And some, or I mis-say, of neither;—\r\n\r\nbut their value, it need hardly be said, is enhanced by this very\r\nvariety. Proceeding from so many independent sources, produced for the\r\nmost part, too, upon the spot, and in the order of time in which they\r\nappear in the narrative;—these unconnected sketches may be believed to\r\npresent, if a less minute and circumstantial, certainly a more vivid as\r\nwell as more reliable, portraiture of Mezzofanti, than could be hoped\r\neven from the daily scrutiny of familiar friends, intimately conversant\r\nwith his every day life, but always viewing his character from the same\r\nunvarying point, and rather submitting the result of their own matured\r\nobservations of what Mezzofanti seemed to them to be, than affording\r\nmaterials for a calm and dispassionate estimate of what he really was.\r\nNor must it be forgotten that no single chronicler, even had he the\r\ncircumstantiality of a Boswell, could be capable of keeping a record\r\nof Mezzofanti’s life, which could be available as the foundation of a\r\nsatisfactory judgment as to the real extent and nature of his linguistic\r\naccomplishment. It is only another Mezzofanti who would be a competent\r\nwitness on such a question; and, in default of a single Polyglot critic\r\nof his attainments in all the languages which he is supposed to have\r\nknown, we shall best consult the interests of truth and science, by\r\nconsidering severally, in reference to each of these languages, the\r\njudgment formed regarding his performance therein by those whose native\r\nlanguage it was.\r\n\r\nI have already said that the office of librarian brought him into contact\r\nwith most of the strangers, especially of the literary class, who visited\r\nBologna. In Bolognese society, too, he was more courted and sought after\r\nthan his modest and retiring disposition would have desired. In the house\r\nof the Cardinal-Archbishop Opizzoni, and of the Cardinal Legates, Lanti,\r\nand Spina, he was always an honoured guest. With several of the noble\r\nfamilies of the city, especially the Marescalchi, the Angelelli, the\r\nAmerini, and the Zambeccari, he lived on terms of the closest intimacy.\r\nThe Cavaliere Pezzana mentions that when, on a visit to Bologna in 1817,\r\nhe was dining at the first named palace, Mezzofanti came in uninvited,\r\nand almost as one of the family. At all these houses his opportunities of\r\nmeeting foreigners of every race and language may easily be believed to\r\nhave been frequent, and of the most various character.\r\n\r\nThe earliest English visitor of the Abate Mezzofanti whom I have been\r\nable to discover is Mr. Harford, author of the recent “Life of Michael\r\nAngelo Buonarroti,”[372] and proprietor of the valuable gallery of\r\nBlaise Castle, which Dr. Waagen describes in his “Treasures of Art in\r\nEngland.”[373]\r\n\r\nMr. Harford visited Bologna in the autumn of 1817, at which time he first\r\nmade Mezzofanti’s acquaintance. He renewed the acquaintance subsequently\r\nat Rome, and on both occasions had a full opportunity of observing and\r\nof testing his extraordinary gift of language. Mr. Harford has kindly\r\ncommunicated to me his recollections of Mezzofanti at both these periods\r\nof life, which, (although the latter part anticipates the order of time\r\nby nearly thirty years,) may most naturally be inserted together.\r\n\r\n    “I first made the acquaintance of the Abbé Mezzofanti,” writes\r\n    Mr. Harford, “at the table of Cardinal Lanti, brother of the\r\n    Duke of Lanti, then Legate of Bologna. This was in the year\r\n    1817. The Cardinal was then living at the public palace at\r\n    Bologna, but I had previously known him in Rome. He was a man\r\n    of highly cultivated mind, and of gentlemanly and agreeable\r\n    manners. He made his guests perfectly at their ease, and I\r\n    well recollect, after dinner, forming one of a group around\r\n    Abbé Mezzofanti, and listening with deep interest to his\r\n    animated conversation, which had reference, in consequence\r\n    of questions put to him, to various topics, illustrating\r\n    his wonderful acquaintance with the principal languages of\r\n    the world. Report, at this time, gave him credit for being\r\n    master of upwards of forty languages; and I recollect, among\r\n    other things, his giving proof of his familiar acquaintance\r\n    with the Welsh. I had some particular conversation with him\r\n    upon the origin of what is called Saxon, Norman, and Lombard\r\n    architecture, and I remember his entire accordance with the\r\n    opinion I threw out, that it resolved itself in each case into\r\n    a corruption of Roman architecture.\r\n\r\n    “My next interview with him was after a long lapse of time,\r\n    for I did not meet him again till the year 1846, the winter\r\n    of which I passed in Rome. The Abbé was then changed into the\r\n    Cardinal Mezzofanti. I found him occupying a handsome suite\r\n    of apartments in a palazzo in the Piazza Santi Apostoli. He\r\n    assured me he well remembered meeting Mrs. H. and myself at\r\n    Cardinal Lanti’s, on the occasion above referred to; and\r\n    in the course of several visits which I paid him during\r\n    the winter and ensuing spring, his conversation was always\r\n    animated and agreeable. He conversed with me in English, which\r\n    he spoke with the utmost fluency and correctness, and only\r\n    with a slight foreign accent. His familiar knowledge of our\r\n    provincial dialects quite surprised me. ‘Do you know much of\r\n    the Yorkshire dialect?’ he said to me: and then, with much\r\n    humour, gave me various specimens of its peculiarities; ‘and\r\n    your _Zummersetshire_ dialect,’ he went on to say, laughing as\r\n    he spoke, and imitating it.\r\n\r\n    “On another occasion he spoke to me with high admiration of the\r\n    style of Addison, preferring it to that of any English author\r\n    with whom he was acquainted. He commended its ease, elegance,\r\n    and grace; and then contrasted it with the grandiloquence of\r\n    Johnson, whose powerful mind and copious fancy he also greatly\r\n    admired, though he deemed him much inferior in real wit and\r\n    taste to Addison. In all this I fully agreed with him; and then\r\n    inquired whether he had ever read Boswell’s Life of Johnson,\r\n    and, finding he had not, I told him he must allow me to send\r\n    it to him, as I felt assured, from the interest he displayed\r\n    in our English literature, it would much amuse and delight him.\r\n    This promise I subsequently fulfilled.[374]\r\n\r\n    “Speaking to me about an English lady with whom I was well\r\n    acquainted, he eagerly inquired, ‘_Is she a blue-stocking?_’\r\n\r\n    “He one day talked to me about the Chinese language and its\r\n    difficulties, and told me that some time back a gentleman\r\n    who had resided in China visited him. ‘I concluded,’ he\r\n    added, ‘that I might address him in Chinese, and did so;—but,\r\n    after exchanging a few sentences with me, he begged that we\r\n    might pursue our conversation in French. We talked, however,\r\n    long enough for me to discover that he spoke in _the Canton\r\n    dialect_.’\r\n\r\n    “That one who had never set his foot out of Italy should be\r\n    thus able in an instant to detect the little peculiarities of\r\n    dialect in a man who had lived in China, did, I acknowledge,\r\n    strike me with astonishment.\r\n\r\n    “This sort of critical sagacity in languages enabled the\r\n    Cardinal to render important services to the Propaganda College\r\n    at Rome, in which he held a high office. I was not only struck\r\n    with the fluency, but with the rapidity with which he spoke\r\n    the English language, and, I might also add, the idiomatic\r\n    correctness of his expressions.\r\n\r\n    “So much of celebrity attached itself to his name that\r\n    foreigners of distinction gladly sought occasions of making\r\n    his acquaintance. On being ushered into his presence on one of\r\n    my visits I found him surrounded by a large party of admirers,\r\n    including several ladies, who all appeared highly delighted\r\n    with his animated conversation.”\r\n\r\nWe shall have other opportunities of adverting to his curiously minute\r\nacquaintance, not only with English literature, but even with the\r\nprovincial dialects of English, by which Mr. Harford was so much struck.\r\nBut, as some difference of opinion has been expressed with regard to his\r\nacquaintance with Welsh, I think it right to note the circumstance that\r\nMr. Harford distinctly remembers him, as early as 1817, to have given\r\n“proofs of familiar acquaintance” with that language.[375]\r\n\r\nSomewhat later in the same year, November, 1817, Mr. Stewart Rose visited\r\nMezzofanti. The ordeal to which his linguistic powers were submitted in\r\nMr. Rose’s presence was more severe and more varied than that witnessed\r\nby Mr. Harford; the former having heard him tried in German, Greek, and\r\nTurkish, as well as in English. But as we shall have abundant independent\r\ntestimony for each of these, Mr. Rose’s testimony is specially important,\r\nas recording the exceeding accuracy of Mezzofanti’s English, which he\r\ntested by “long and repeated conversations.”\r\n\r\n“As this country,” he writes, “has been fertile in every variety of\r\ngenius, from that which handles the pencil to that which sweeps the\r\nskies with the telescope; so even in this, her least favourite beat,\r\nshe has produced men who, in early life, have embraced such a circle of\r\nlanguages, as one should hardly imagine their ages would have enabled\r\nthem to obtain. Thus the wonders which are related of one of these, Pico\r\ndi Mirandola, I always considered fabulous, till I was myself the witness\r\nof acquisitions which can scarcely be considered less extraordinary.\r\n\r\n“The living lion to whom I allude is Signor Mezzofanti of Bologna, who\r\nwhen I saw him, though he was only thirty-six years old, read twenty\r\nand wrote eighteen languages. This is the least marvellous part of the\r\nstory. He spoke all these fluently, and those of which I could judge\r\nwith the most extraordinary precision. I had the pleasure of dining with\r\nhim formerly in the house of a Bolognese lady, at whose table a German\r\nofficer declared he could not have distinguished him from a German. He\r\npassed the whole of the next day with G—— and myself, and G— told me he\r\nshould have taken him for an Englishman, who had been some time out of\r\nEngland. A Smyrniote servant who was with me, bore equal testimony to\r\nhis skill in other languages, and declared he might pass for a Greek or\r\na Turk in the dominions of the Grand Seignior. But what most surprised\r\nme was his accuracy; for, during long and repeated conversations in\r\nEnglish, he never once misapplied the _sign_ of a tense, that fearful\r\nstumblingblock to Scotch and Irish, in whose writings there is always to\r\nbe found some abuse of these undefinable niceties. The marvel was, if\r\npossible, rendered more marvellous by this gentleman’s accomplishments\r\nand information, things rare in linguists, who generally mistake\r\nthe means for the end. It ought also to be stated that his various\r\nacquisitions had all been made in Bologna, from which, when I saw him, he\r\nhad never wandered above thirty miles.”[376]\r\n\r\nMr. Rose was mistaken in supposing that Mezzofanti at this time was but\r\nthirty-six years old. He was in reality forty-three; but the testimony\r\nwhich he bears to his “general accomplishments and information” will be\r\nfound to be confirmed by very many succeeding travellers.\r\n\r\nIt was earlier in the same year, probably in June, on his return from\r\nRome to Venice,[377] that Lord Byron first saw Mezzofanti. The extract\r\ngiven by Moore from his Journal, in which he describes the impressions\r\nmade upon him by their intercourse has no date attached; but as he\r\nalso alludes to Mezzofanti as among “the great names of Italy” in the\r\nDedication of the Fourth Canto of Childe Harold, which is dated January,\r\n2nd, 1818, it would seem likely that he had met him at least before\r\nthat date.[378] Of the particulars of their intercourse no record is\r\npreserved; but Mezzofanti always spoke with profound interest of his\r\nnoble visitor. He was perfectly familiar with his poetry. The late Dr.\r\nCox of Southampton assured me that his criticism of the several poems,\r\nand especially of Childe Harold, would do credit to our best reviews. And\r\nhe often expressed the deepest regret for the early and unhappy fate, by\r\nwhich this gifted man was called away while he still lay in the shadow\r\nof that cold and gloomy scepticism which so often marred his better\r\nimpulses, and—\r\n\r\n    Flung o’er all that’s warm and bright,\r\n    The winter of an icy creed.\r\n\r\n“Alas!” he one day said to M. Manavit, “that desolating scepticism which\r\nhad long oppressed his soul, was not natural to such a mind. Sooner or\r\nlater he would have awakened from it. And then it only remained for\r\nhim to open the most glorious page in his Childe Harold’s adventurous\r\nPilgrimage—that in which, reviewing all his doubts, his struggles, and\r\nhis sorrows, and laying bare the deep wounds of his haughty soul, he\r\nshould have sought rest from them all in the peaceful bosom of the faith\r\nof his fathers.”[379]\r\n\r\nSuch a feeling as this on the part of Mezzofanti gives a melancholy\r\ninterest to the well-known passage, half laughing, half admiring, in\r\nwhich Byron records his recollections of the great linguist.\r\n\r\n“In general,” he says, “I do not draw well with literary men;—not that\r\nI dislike them; but I never knew what to say to them, after I have\r\npraised their last publication. There are several exceptions, to be\r\nsure; but then they have either been men of the world, such as Scott and\r\nMoore, &c., or visionaries out of it, such as Shelley, &c.; but your\r\nliterary every-day man and I never met well in company;—especially your\r\nforeigners, whom I never could abide, except Giordani, &c., &c., &c., (I\r\nreally can’t name any other.) I don’t remember a man amongst them whom I\r\never wished to see twice, except perhaps Mezzophanti, who is a monster\r\nof languages, the Briareus of parts of speech, a walking polyglot, and\r\nmore;—who ought to have existed at the time of the Tower of Babel, as\r\nuniversal interpreter.[380] He is, indeed, a marvel—unassuming also. I\r\ntried him in all the tongues in which I knew a single oath or adjuration\r\nto the gods, against post-boys, savages, Tartars, boatmen, sailors,\r\npilots, gondoliers, muleteers, camel-drivers, vetturini, post-masters,\r\npost-houses, post, everything; and egad! he astounded me—even to my\r\nEnglish.”\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Gaume adds, in reference to the last of these languages, an\r\nanecdote still current in Rome, though doubtless a mere exaggeration[381]\r\nof the real story; viz., that, “when Byron had exhausted his vocabulary\r\nof English slang, Mezzofanti quietly asked: ‘And is that all?’\r\n\r\n‘I can go no further.’ replied the noble poet, ‘unless I coin words for\r\nthe purpose.’\r\n\r\n‘Pardon me, my Lord,’ rejoined Mezzofanti; and proceeded to repeat for\r\nhim a variety of the refinements of London slang, till then unknown to\r\nhis visitor’s rich vocabulary!”[382]\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1817-8, a literary society was formed in Bologna for\r\nthe cultivation of poetry and the publication of literary and scientific\r\nessays, of which Mezzofanti was appointed president.\r\n\r\nThe original members of this body were twenty-one in number, and\r\nincluded Ranzani, Angelelli, Mezzofanti’s nephew, Giuseppe Minarelli,\r\nseveral professors, both of the University, and of the Academia delle\r\nBelle Arti, and some literary noblemen and gentlemen of the city.\r\nThey met occasionally for readings and recitations; and printed a\r\nserial collection, called _Opuscoli Letterarj di Bologna_. I had hopes\r\nof learning something from the records of this society, or from the\r\nrecollections of its members, which might tend to illustrate the history\r\nof Mezzofanti’s studies at this period: but, unhappily, not a single\r\noriginal member of the society is now living; and their only publication\r\navailable for the purposes of this biography is Mezzofanti’s own\r\n_Discorso in Lode del P. Aponte_;—his solitary publication, which was\r\nprinted in the _Opuscoli Letterarj_, in 1820.\r\n\r\nMezzofanti continued, even after the formation of this society, to\r\nfrequent the meetings of the Academy of the Institute. On the 3rd of\r\nDecember, 1818, he read a paper in this Academy, “on a remarkable\r\nMexican MS., preserved in the Library of the Institute.” This paper\r\nwas most probably the basis of the Essay upon the Mexican Calendar\r\nalready alluded to. As it entered minutely into the whole subject of the\r\nhieroglyphical writings of the Mexicans, and discussed at some length\r\nthe opinions of all the various writers on Mexican antiquities down to\r\nHumboldt, the paper created very considerable interest in the Academy,\r\nand was spoken of with praise by the literary journals of the day.[383]\r\n\r\nThe visit of the Emperor Francis I. of Austria to Bologna in 1819,\r\ncontributed still more to establish the reputation of Mezzofanti. Having\r\nappointed an interview with him, the Emperor took the precaution of\r\nsecuring during the audience the presence of a number of members of his\r\nsuite, carefully selected so as to represent the chief languages of the\r\nAustrian Empire. Each in turn, German, Magyar, Bohemian, Wallachian,\r\nIllyrian, and Pole, took occasion to address the astonished professor;\r\nbut although naturally somewhat startled by the novelty of the scene, and\r\nperhaps abashed by the presence of royalty, he replied with such perfect\r\nfluency and correctness to each, “as to extort not merely approval but\r\nadmiration and applause.”[384]\r\n\r\nThe year 1819 is further notable as the date of Mezzofanti’s only\r\npublished composition, the above-named panegyric of his early friend and\r\ninstructor Emanuel Aponte. The death of this excellent and venerable\r\nman had occurred more than three years earlier, (November 22, 1815),\r\nand his funeral oration had been pronounced by Filippo Schiassi, the\r\nprofessor of numismatics, as also by Pacifico Deani, whose discourse\r\nwas translated into Spanish by Don Camillo Salina. Aponte’s grateful\r\npupil, nevertheless, took advantage of the opportunity afforded by\r\nthe opening of the public studies of the university, to offer his own\r\nespecial tribute to the piety and learning of the good old father, and\r\nparticularly to the excellence of his method of teaching the Greek\r\nlanguage and the merits of a Grammar which he had published for the use\r\nof the higher schools.\r\n\r\nThe Discourse is chiefly occupied (after a sketch of Aponte’s life and\r\ncharacter) with a criticism of the method pursued in this Grammar,—a\r\ncriticism chiefly noticeable as embodying the method, (which we know from\r\nother sources to have been the speaker’s own,) of studying a language\r\nrather by rhythm than by rule; “by ascertaining its normal structure,\r\nthe principle which governs its inflexions, and especially the dominant\r\nprinciple which regulates the changes of letters according to the\r\ndifferent organs of speech.”\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of this general manner of the Discourse, I shall translate\r\nthe concluding paragraphs,—the exhortation to the study of Greek\r\nliterature with which the professor takes leave of his audience.\r\n\r\n    “And still shall these studies flourish, my dear young friends,\r\n    perpetuated by you under the guidance of the instructions\r\n    which Father Emanuel bequeathed to us. His method, which,\r\n    in the acquisition of the language, rather exercises the\r\n    reason than burdens the memory, and which makes good sense\r\n    the chief basis for the right interpretation of an author,\r\n    will assuredly conduct to the desired end that ardour which,\r\n    on this solemn occasion, you feel renewed within you: an\r\n    ardour so great that, had I to-day spoken solely of the\r\n    difficulties and obstacles in the path of learning, it would,\r\n    nevertheless, give you strength and courage to encounter and\r\n    overcome them. Well, therefore, may we have confidence in\r\n    you, and believe that you will preserve to your native land\r\n    the fame achieved by your forefathers in Grecian studies.\r\n    These studies are the special inheritance of our countrymen.\r\n    In Italy the muses of Greece sought an asylum, when they fled\r\n    before the invader from their ancient glorious abode. Learned\r\n    Greeks were at that period dispersed through our principal\r\n    cities, where, establishing schools, they found munificent\r\n    patrons and zealous pupils. In Rome Grecian literature enjoyed\r\n    the generous patronage of Nicholas V.; and around Cardinal\r\n    Bessarion were gathered men of vast erudition, who renewed\r\n    the lustre of the old Athenian schools, cultivating a wiser\r\n    philosophy, however, than the ancients employed; and, thanks\r\n    to the precious volumes accumulated by those two illustrious\r\n    Mæcenases and by the princes of Italy; thanks to the skill of\r\n    the masters and the aptitude and excellence of Italian genius,\r\n    Grecian literature, conjointly with Latin, quickly attained\r\n    the highest pitch of cultivation amongst us, ushering in the\r\n    golden age of Italian letters. A countless series of names\r\n    distinguished in this branch of learning presents itself before\r\n    me: but I delight rather to consider in prospect the future\r\n    series which begins in you. Be not disturbed by any fear\r\n    that the pursuit to which I am exhorting you will hinder the\r\n    profounder study of the sciences. Alas, very different are the\r\n    thoughts, very different, indeed, the cares which distract the\r\n    mind of youth and turn its generous fervour aside, miserably\r\n    disappointing the bright hopes that were formed of it. No:\r\n    theologians, lawyers, philosophers, physicians, mathematicians,\r\n    all men of science and learning, have ever found in the Greek\r\n    literature their most agreeable solace. Many of the sciences\r\n    had, in Greece, early reached a high degree of perfection;\r\n    others made a noble beginning in that country; most of them\r\n    are embellished with titles borrowed from its language;\r\n    and all of them have recourse to Greek when they wish, with\r\n    precision and dignity, to denominate, and thereby to define,\r\n    the objects of their consideration. ‘These studies,’ says one\r\n    who owed much of his eloquence to the industry with which he\r\n    cultivated them, ‘furnish youth with profitable and delightful\r\n    knowledge; they amuse maturer years; they adorn prosperity,\r\n    and in adversity afford an asylum from care; they delight us\r\n    in the quiet of home, and are no hindrance in affairs of the\r\n    gravest moment; they discover for us many a useful thing; for\r\n    the traveller they procure the regard of strangers, and, in\r\n    the solitude of the country, they solace the mind with the\r\n    purest of pleasures.’ Let your main study, then, be the sterner\r\n    sciences; Greek shall follow as a faithful companion, affording\r\n    you useful assistance therein as well as delightful recreation.\r\n    And thus, thinking of nothing else, having nothing else at\r\n    heart, than religion and learning, let the expectations of your\r\n    friends and of your country be fulfilled in you. Thus shall you\r\n    correspond with the paternal designs of our best of princes,\r\n    His Holiness, the Sovereign Pontiff, who, in his munificence\r\n    and splendour, daily enlarges the dignity of this illustrious\r\n    University, promoting, by wise provisions, your education and\r\n    your glory. And, whilst you vigorously prosecute the career\r\n    so well begun, while your love for Greek increases with the\r\n    increasing profit you derive from it, I, too, will exult in\r\n    your brilliant, progress. To this I will look for a monument,\r\n    truly durable and immortal, of my dear Father Emanuel, to whom\r\n    I feel myself bound by eternal gratitude; since gratitude,\r\n    reverence, and devotion are surely due to them who, by example\r\n    and by precept, point out to us the road to virtue and to\r\n    learning, inviting and exhorting us, with loving solicitude,\r\n    to direct our lives to praiseworthy pursuits and to true\r\n    happiness.”[385] (pp. 22-26.)\r\n\r\nSoon after the death of Father Aponte, Mezzofanti had the further grief\r\nof losing his friend, the celebrated Signora Clotilda Tambroni, who,\r\nalthough considerably older than he, had been, as we have seen, his\r\nfellow pupil under Father Aponte, and with whom he had ever afterwards\r\ncontinued upon terms of most intimate friendship. Like Mezzofanti, the\r\nSignora Tambroni was, after the publication of the concordat, reinstated\r\nin the Greek professorship from which she had been dispossessed at the\r\noccupation of Bologna by the French. She was an excellent linguist,\r\nbeing familiar with Greek, Latin, Spanish, French, and English,[386]\r\nand a poetess of some reputation, not only in her own, but also in the\r\nlearned languages.[387] The Breslau professor, already referred to,\r\nHerr Kephalides, was much interested by her conversation; and that\r\nthe interest which she created did not arise merely from the unusual\r\ncircumstance of a lady’s devoting herself to such studies, but from her\r\nown unquestioned learning and ability, is attested by all who knew her.\r\n“It was a pleasant thing,” says Lady Morgan,[388] “to hear her learned\r\ncoadjutor [Mezzofanti] in describing to us the good qualities of her\r\nheart, do ample justice to the profound learning which had raised her\r\nto an equality of collegiate rank with himself, without an innuendo at\r\nthat erudition, which, in England, is a greater female stigma than vice\r\nitself.”\r\n\r\nThe lively but caustic authoress just named, visited Italy in 1819-20. In\r\nher account of Bologna she devotes a note to the Abate Mezzofanti, under\r\nwhose escort, (which she recognises as a peculiar advantage,) she visited\r\nthe library and museum of the University.\r\n\r\n“The well-known Abate Mezzofanti, librarian to the Institute,” she\r\nwrites, “was of our party. Conversing with this very learned person on\r\nthe subject of his ‘forty languages,’ he smiled at the exaggeration, and\r\nsaid, that although he had gone over the outline of forty languages, he\r\nwas not master of them, as he had dropped such as had not books worth\r\nreading. His Greek master, being a Spaniard, taught him Spanish. The\r\nGerman, Polish, Bohemian, and Hungarian tongues he originally acquired\r\nduring the occupation of Bologna by the Austrian power; and afterwards\r\nhe had learned French from the French, and English by reading and\r\nby conversing with English travellers. With all this superfluity of\r\nlanguages, he spoke nothing but Bolognese in his own family. With us, he\r\nalways spoke English, and with scarcely any accent, though I believe he\r\nhas never been out of Bologna. His tone of phrase and peculiar selection\r\nof words were those of the ‘Spectator;’ and it is probable that he was\r\nmost conversant with the English works of that day. The Abate Mezzofanti\r\nwas professor of the Greek and Oriental languages under the French: when\r\nBuonaparte abolished the Greek professorship, Mezzofanti was pensioned\r\noff. He was again made Greek professor by the Austrians, again set aside\r\nby the French, and again restored by the Pope.”[389]\r\n\r\nLike most of Lady Morgan’s sketches, this account of Mezzofanti, although\r\ninteresting, is not free from inaccuracies. Thus she falls into the\r\ncommon error already noticed, that Mezzofanti up to this time “had never\r\nbeen out of Bologna,” and a still more important mistake as to the cause\r\nof his first deprivation of his professorship. He was dispossessed of\r\nthis professorship, (which, it may be added, was not of Greek but of\r\nArabic,) not because the professorship was suppressed, but because he\r\ndeclined to take the oaths to the new government. The account of his\r\nsecond deprivation is also inaccurate; and the assertion that he never\r\ncultivated any languages except those which “had books worth reading,” we\r\nshall see hereafter, to be entirely without foundation.\r\n\r\nThe statement too, that “he spoke only Bolognese in his own family” is\r\nan exaggeration. With the elder members of the family—his father, his\r\nmother, and his sister, Signora Minarelli—it was so; and there was a\r\ncousin of his, named Antonia Mezzofanti, a lively and agreeable old dame,\r\nand a frequent guest at the house of his sister, to whom he was much\r\nattached, and with whom he delighted to converse in the pleasant dialect\r\nof Bologna. But the children of his sister were all well educated,\r\nand, like the educated classes throughout all the provincial cities of\r\nItaly, habitually spoke the common and classical Italian language. Even\r\nafter Mezzofanti came to Rome, when questioned as to the number of\r\nlanguages that he spoke, he often used jestingly to reply: “fifty, and\r\nBolognese.”[390]\r\n\r\nVery nearly at the same time with Lady Morgan’s interview, Mezzofanti was\r\nvisited by a tourist far more competent to form a just opinion of the\r\nextent of his attainments—M. Molbech, a Danish scholar, author of a Tour\r\nin Germany, France, England, and Italy. I shall close the chapter with\r\nhis testimony. It is chiefly valuable, in reference to his own language,\r\nthe Danish, in which he had an opportunity of fully testing Mezzofanti’s\r\nknowledge, in an interview of nearly two hours’ duration. It is clear,\r\ntoo, from the very tone of his narrative, that, while he carried away the\r\nhighest admiration for the extraordinary man whom he had seen, he was\r\nby no means disposed to fall into that blind and indiscriminate eulogy\r\nof which other less instructed and more imaginative visitors have been\r\naccused.\r\n\r\n    “At last, in the afternoon,” he writes, “I succeeded in meeting\r\n    one of the living wonders of Italy, the librarian Mezzofanti,\r\n    with whom I had only spoken for a few moments in the gallery,\r\n    when I passed through Bologna before: I now spent a couple of\r\n    hours with him, at his lodgings in the university building,\r\n    and at the library, and would willingly, for his sake alone,\r\n    have prolonged my stay at Bologna for a couple of days, if I\r\n    had not been bound by contract with the vetturino as far as\r\n    Venice. His celebrity must be an inconvenience to him; for\r\n    scarcely any educated traveller leaves Bologna without having\r\n    paid him a visit, and the hired guides never omit to mention\r\n    his name among the first curiosities of the town. This learned\r\n    Italian, who has never been so far from his birthplace,\r\n    Bologna, as to Florence or Rome, is certainly one of the\r\n    world’s greatest geniuses in point of languages. I do not know\r\n    the number he understands, but there is scarcely any European\r\n    dialect, whether Romanic, Scandinavian, or Slavonic, that this\r\n    miraculous polyglottist does not speak. It is said the total\r\n    amounts to more than thirty languages; and among them is that\r\n    of the gipsies, which he learned to speak from a gipsy who was\r\n    quartered with an Hungarian regiment at Bologna.\r\n\r\n    “I found a German with him, with whom he was conversing in\r\n    fluent and well sounding German; when we were alone, and I\r\n    began to speak to him in the same language, he interrupted\r\n    me with a question in Danish, ‘Hvorledes har det behaget dem\r\n    i Italien?’ (‘How have you been pleased with Italy?’) After\r\n    this, he pursued the conversation in Danish, by his own desire,\r\n    almost all the time I continued with him, as this, according\r\n    to his own polite expression, was a pleasure he did not often\r\n    enjoy; and he spoke the language, from want of exercise,\r\n    certainly not with the same fluency and ease as English or\r\n    German, but with almost entire correctness. Imagine my delight\r\n    at such a conversation! Of Danish books, however, I found in\r\n    his rich and excellent philological collection no more than\r\n    Baden’s Grammar, and Hallage’s Norwegian Vocabulary; and in\r\n    the library Haldorson’s Icelandic Dictionary, in which he made\r\n    me read him a couple of pages of the preface as a lesson in\r\n    pronunciation. Our conversation turned mostly on Northern and\r\n    German literature. The last he is pretty minutely acquainted\r\n    with; and he is very fond of German poetry, which he has\r\n    succeeded in bringing into fashion with the ladies of Bologna,\r\n    so that Schiller and Goethe, whom the Romans hardly know by\r\n    name, are here read in the original, and their works are to be\r\n    had in the library. This collection occupies a finely-built\r\n    saloon, in which it is arranged in dark presses with wire\r\n    gratings, and is said to contain about 120,000 volumes. Besides\r\n    Mezzofanti, there are an under librarian, two assistants, and\r\n    three other servants. Books are bought to the amount of about\r\n    1000 scudi, or more than 200_l._ sterling, a year. Mezzofanti\r\n    is not merely a linguist, but is well acquainted with literary\r\n    history and biography, and also with the library under his\r\n    charge. As an author he is not known, so far as I am aware; and\r\n    he seems at present to be no older than about forty. I must\r\n    add, what perhaps would be least expected from a learned man\r\n    who has been unceasingly occupied with linguistic studies, and\r\n    has hardly been out of his native town, that he has the finest\r\n    and most polished manners, and, at the same time, the most\r\n    engaging good nature.”[391]\r\n\r\nHerr Molbech is still the chief secretary of the Royal Library in\r\nCopenhagen. He is one of the most distinguished writers on Danish\r\nphilology; his great Danish Dictionary[392] is the classical authority on\r\nthe language; and, in recognition of his great literary merits, he has\r\nbeen created a privy councillor and a commander of the Danebrog order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n[1820-1828.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMezzofanti’s regular studies suffered some interruption in the early\r\npart of 1820. Debilitated by the excessive and protracted application\r\nwhich has been described, his health had for some time been gradually\r\ngiving way, and at last he was peremptorily ordered to suspend his\r\nlectures, and to discontinue his private studies for six months.[393]\r\nDuring this interval he employed himself chiefly in botanizing, a study\r\nin which he is said to have made considerable progress. He also made a\r\nshort excursion to the beautiful district of Mantua, and afterwards to\r\nModena, Pisa, and Leghorn.[394] In the course of this journey he found\r\nan opportunity of making himself acquainted with the Hebrew Psalmody\r\nas followed in the modern synagogues, and with the practical system of\r\naccentuation of the ancient Hebrew Language now in use among the Jews\r\nof Italy. The object of his visit to Leghorn was, that, from the Greek\r\nsailors of that port, he might acquire the pronunciation of modern\r\nRomaic.[395]\r\n\r\nAfter a short time his health was perfectly restored, with the exception\r\nof a certain debility of sight from which he never afterwards completely\r\nrecovered; and he resumed his ordinary duties in the university about the\r\nmiddle of the year 1820.\r\n\r\nThe solar eclipse of the 20th of September in that year attracted many\r\nscientific visitors to Bologna and the neighbouring cities. Being annular\r\nin that region, the eclipse was watched with especial interest by all the\r\nastronomers of Northern Italy, by Plana at Turin, by Santini at Padua,\r\nby Padre Inghirami at Florence, and by Padre Tinari at Siena. At Bologna\r\nthe director of the observatory at this time was Pietro Caturegli, editor\r\nof the Bolognese _Efemeridi Astronomiche_, and one of Mezzofanti’s most\r\nvalued friends.\r\n\r\nCaturegli’s reputation and the excellent condition of his observatory,\r\ninduced the celebrated Hungarian Astronomer, Baron Von Zach, who, after\r\na career of much and varied adventure, was at that time engaged in\r\nediting at Genoa the Correspondance Astronomique, (a French continuation\r\nof his former German Journal _Monatliche Correspondenz für Erz- und\r\nHimmels-Kunde_,) to select Bologna as the place from which to observe\r\nthis interesting phenomenon. He was accompanied by a Russian nobleman,\r\nPrince Volkonski, a man of highly cultivated literary and scientific\r\ntastes, and by Captain Smyth of H. M. Ship, _Aid_, who had just completed\r\nhis survey of the Ionian Islands. Notwithstanding numerous and urgent\r\napplications from other quarters, these three distinguished foreigners,\r\ntogether with his friend Mezzofanti, were the only persons whom Caturegli\r\nadmitted to the observatory during his observations of the eclipse.\r\n\r\nThe Baron published in his Journal[396] a very full account of the\r\nphenomena of the eclipse, to which he appended as a note the following\r\nsketch of his companion on the occasion.\r\n\r\n    “The annular eclipse of the sun,” he writes, “was one curiosity\r\n    for us, and Signor Mezzofanti was another. This extraordinary\r\n    man is really a rival of Mithridates; he speaks thirty-two\r\n    languages, living and dead, in the manner I am going to\r\n    describe. He accosted me in Hungarian, and with a compliment\r\n    so well turned, and in such excellent Magyar, that I was\r\n    quite taken by surprise and stupefied. He afterwards spoke\r\n    to me in German, at first in good Saxon (the _Crusca_ of the\r\n    Germans,) and then in the Austrian and Swabian dialects, with\r\n    a correctness of accent that amazed me to the last degree,\r\n    and made me burst into a fit of laughter at the thought of\r\n    the contrast between the language and the appearance of this\r\n    astonishing professor. He spoke English to Captain Smyth,\r\n    Russian and Polish to Prince Volkonski, not stuttering and\r\n    stammering, but with the same volubility as if he had been\r\n    speaking his mother tongue, the dialect of Bologna. I was\r\n    quite unable to tear myself away from him. At a dinner at the\r\n    cardinal legate’s, Della Spina, his eminence placed me at table\r\n    next him; after having chatted with him in several languages,\r\n    all of which he spoke much better than I did, it came into my\r\n    head to address to him on a sudden some words of Wallachian.\r\n    Without hesitation, and without appearing to remark what an\r\n    out-of-the-way dialect I had branched off to, off went my\r\n    polyglot in the same language, and so fast, that I was obliged\r\n    to say to him; ‘Gently, gently, Mr. Abbé; I really can’t follow\r\n    you; I am at the end of my Latin-Wallachian.’ It was more than\r\n    forty years since I had spoken the language, or even thought of\r\n    it, though I knew it very well in my youth, when I served in an\r\n    Hungarian regiment, and was in garrison at Transylvania. The\r\n    professor was not only more ready in the language than I, but\r\n    he informed me on this occasion, that he knew another tongue\r\n    that I had never been able to get hold of, though I had enjoyed\r\n    better opportunities of doing so than he, as I formerly had men\r\n    that spoke it in my regiment.\r\n\r\n    “This was the language of the Zigans, or Gipsies, whom the\r\n    French so improperly call Bohemians, at which the good and\r\n    genuine Bohemians, that is to say, the inhabitants of the\r\n    kingdom of Bohemia, are not a little indignant. But how could\r\n    an Italian abbé, who had never been out of his native town,\r\n    find means to learn a language that is neither written nor\r\n    printed? In the Italian wars an Hungarian regiment was in\r\n    garrison at Bologna: the language-loving professor discovered a\r\n    gipsy in it, and made him his teacher; and, with the facility\r\n    and happy memory that nature has gifted him with, he was soon\r\n    master of the language, which, it is believed, is nothing but a\r\n    dialect, and a corrupted one into the bargain, of some tribes\r\n    of Parias of Hindostan.”[397]\r\n\r\nThe wide and peculiar circulation of the journal in which this\r\ninteresting sketch appeared, contributed more than any previous notice to\r\nextend the fame of Mezzofanti. As might naturally be expected, however,\r\ndetails so marvellous, were received with considerable incredulity by\r\nsome, and were explained away by others as mere embellishments of a\r\ntraveller’s tale. In consequence, Von Zach, in a subsequent number of\r\nhis journal, not only reiterated the statement, but added fuller and more\r\ninteresting particulars regarding it.\r\n\r\n    “Many persons have doubted,” he writes, “what we said of\r\n    this astonishing professor of Bologna in our fourth volume;\r\n    as there have also been persons who doubted what Valerius\r\n    Maximus relates of the analogous talents of Cyrus and\r\n    Mithridates. Although all historians have the character of\r\n    being a little given to lying, Valerius, notwithstanding,\r\n    passes for a sufficiently veracious author. He says in the\r\n    eighth book and 9th chapter of his History, or rather of his\r\n    Compendium of History: _Cyrus ommium militum suorum nomina,\r\n    Mithridates duarum et viginti gentium quæ sub regno ejus\r\n    erant linguas, ediscendo_. People who came several centuries\r\n    after, and who probably did not know more than one language,\r\n    and possibly not even that one correctly, have pretended that\r\n    the twenty-two languages of Mithridates were only different\r\n    dialects, and that Cyrus only knew the names of his generals.\r\n    It may be so; we know nothing of the reality, and consequently\r\n    shall not contradict those critics; but what we do know is,\r\n    that Signor Mezzofanti speaks very good German, Hungarian,\r\n    Slavonic, Wallachian, Russian, Polish, French and English. I\r\n    have mentioned my authorities. It has been said that Prince\r\n    Volkonski and Captain Smyth gave their testimony in favour\r\n    of this wonderful professor, out of politeness only. But I\r\n    asked the prince alone, how the professor spoke Russian, and\r\n    he told me he should be very glad if his own son spoke it as\r\n    well. The child spoke English and French better than Russian,\r\n    having always been in foreign countries with his father. The\r\n    captain said, ‘the professor speaks English better than I do;\r\n    we sailors knock the language to pieces on board our vessels,\r\n    where we have Scotch and Irish, and foreigners of all sorts;\r\n    there is often an odd sort of jargon spoken in a ship; the\r\n    professor speaks with correctness, and even with elegance; it\r\n    is easy to see that he has studied the language.’\r\n\r\n    “M. Mezzofanti came one day to see me at the hotel where I\r\n    was staying: I happened not to be in my own rooms, but on a\r\n    visit to another traveller who lodged in the same hotel, Baron\r\n    Ulmenstein, a colonel in the King of Hanover’s service, who was\r\n    travelling with his lady. M. Mezzofanti was brought to me; and,\r\n    as I was the only person who knew him, I introduced him to the\r\n    company as a professor and librarian of the university. He took\r\n    part in the conversation, which was carried on in German; and,\r\n    after this had gone on for a considerable time, the baroness\r\n    took an opportunity of asking me aside, how it came to pass\r\n    that a German was a professor and librarian in an Italian\r\n    university. I replied, that M. Mezzofanti was no German,\r\n    that he was a very good Italian, of that city of Bologna,\r\n    and had never been out of it. Judge of the astonishment of\r\n    all the company, and of the explanations that followed! My\r\n    readers, I am sure, will not think such a testimony as the\r\n    Baroness Ulmenstein’s open to any suspicion. She is a thorough\r\n    German, highly cultivated, and speaks four languages in great\r\n    perfection.”[398]\r\n\r\nOne result of the doubts thus expressed as to the credibility of Von\r\nZach’s report was to draw out a testimony to Mezzofanti’s familiarity\r\nwith a language for which he had not before publicly gotten credit, the\r\nCzechish or Bohemian. A correspondent of the Baron at Vienna, having\r\nread his statement in the _Correspondance_, expressed his satisfaction\r\nat the confirmation which it supplied of what he had before regarded as\r\nincredible.\r\n\r\n    “I was very glad,” he writes, “to see confirmed by you what the\r\n    Chevalier d’Odelga, colonel and commandant of Prince Leopold\r\n    of Naples’ regiment, told me of that marvellous man. Chevalier\r\n    d’Odelga, who is a Bohemian, conversed in that language with\r\n    M. Mezzofanti, and assured me that he would have taken him for\r\n    a countryman had he not known him to be an Italian. I frankly\r\n    confess that until now, I only half believed the tale, for I\r\n    regard the Bohemian language as the very rack of an Italian\r\n    tongue.”[399]\r\n\r\nCaptain (afterwards admiral) Smyth, who accompanied Baron von Zach on\r\nthis occasion, still survives, after a career of high professional\r\nas well as literary and scientific distinction. As a reply to the\r\nincredulity to which Von Zach alludes, I may add not only that Admiral\r\nSmyth in his “Cycle of Celestial Objects for the Use of Astronomers,”\r\nadopts the Baron’s narrative and reprints it at length,[400] but that\r\nhis present recollections of the interview, which he has been so good as\r\nto communicate to me, fully confirm all the Baron’s statements.[401] The\r\nadmiral adds that, although Mezzofanti made no claim to the character of\r\na practical astronomer, he understood well and was much interested in the\r\nphenomena of the eclipse, and especially in its predicted annularity at\r\nBologna. “It was at Mezzofanti’s instance also,” he says, “that Caturegli\r\nundertook to compute in advance the elements for an almanac for the use\r\nof certain distant convents of the Levant, to aid them in celebrating\r\nEaster contemporaneously.”[402]\r\n\r\nStartling, therefore, as Von Zach’s account appeared at the time of its\r\npublication, we can no longer hesitate to receive it literally and in its\r\nintegrity.\r\n\r\nIn reference to one part of it, that which regards the manner in which\r\nMezzofanti acquired the gipsy language—viz., “that he learned it from a\r\ngipsy soldier in one of the Hungarian regiments quartered at Bologna,”\r\nit is proper to observe, that he appears also, towards the end of his\r\nlife, to have studied this dialect from books. The catalogue of his\r\nlibrary contains two Gipsy Grammars, one in German, and one in Italian.\r\nThe peculiar idiom of this strange language in which he himself was\r\ninitiated, is that which prevails among the gipsies of Bohemia and\r\nHungary, or rather Transylvania, which is the purest of all the European\r\ngipsy dialects, and differs considerably from that of the Spanish\r\ngipsies. Borrow has given a short comparative vocabulary[403] of both,\r\nand has also printed the Pater Noster in the Spanish gipsy form.\r\n\r\nThe notoriety which this and other similar narratives procured for\r\nthe modest professor, speedily rendered him an object of curiosity to\r\nevery stranger visiting Bologna; and as there was no want of critics\r\nnot unwilling to question, or at least to scrutinize, the truth of the\r\nmarvels recounted by their predecessors, it may easily be believed that\r\nhis life became in some sort a perpetual ordeal. Thus Blume, the author\r\nof the _Iter Italicum_, who visited Bologna some time after Von Zach,\r\ndoes not hesitate to take the Baron to task, and to declare his account\r\nvery much exaggerated.\r\n\r\n    “Bianconi and Mezzofanti,” says Blume, “are the librarians.\r\n    The latter, as is well known, is considered throughout all\r\n    Europe as a linguistic prodigy, a second Mithridates; and is\r\n    said to speak and write with fluency two-and-thirty dead and\r\n    living languages. Willingly as I join in this admiration,\r\n    especially as his countrymen usually display little talent\r\n    for the acquisition of foreign tongues, I cannot but remark\r\n    that the account recently given in the fourth and fifth\r\n    volumes of Von Zach’s ‘Correspondance Astronomique,’ is very\r\n    much exaggerated. Readiness in speaking a language should\r\n    not be confounded with philological knowledge. I have heard\r\n    few Italians speak German as well as Mezzofanti; but I have\r\n    also heard him maintain that between Platt-Deutsch, or the\r\n    Low German, and the Dutch language, there was no difference\r\n    whatever.”[404]\r\n\r\nIt will be remarked here, however, that these condemnatory observations\r\nof Herr Blume do not regard Mezzofanti’s attainments as a linguist, but\r\nonly his skill as a philologist. On the contrary, to his linguistic\r\ntalents Blume bears testimony hardly less unreserved than that which he\r\ncriticises in the Baron; and as regards the rest of Blume’s criticism,\r\nthe mistake in philology, (as to the identity of Platt-Deutsch with\r\nDutch,) which he alleges, and which appears to be the sole foundation\r\nof his depreciatory judgment of Mezzofanti’s philological knowledge, is\r\ncertainly a very minor one, and one which may be very readily excused\r\nin any other than a German; especially as Adelung (II. 261), distinctly\r\nstates of at least one dialect of Platt-Deutsch, that spoken in Hamburg\r\nand Altona, that it contains a large admixture of Dutch words—so large\r\nthat a cursory observer, if we may judge from the specimens which\r\nAdelung gives (II. 268), might very readily consider the two dialects\r\nalmost identical. As to another statement of Blume’s, which imputes to\r\nMezzofanti a want of courtesy to strangers visiting or studying in the\r\nlibrary, it is contradicted by the unanimous testimony of all who ever\r\nsaw him whether at Bologna or at Rome. He was politeness and good nature\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nBut it must not be supposed that all the visits which Mezzofanti received\r\nwere of the character hitherto described, and were attended with no fruit\r\nbeyond a passing display of his wonderful faculty. Visitors occasionally\r\nappeared, whose knowledge he was enabled to turn to profitable account\r\nin extending his own store of languages. From an Armenian traveller\r\nwho came to Bologna in 1818, he received his first initiation in that\r\ndifficult and peculiar language, which he afterwards extended in a\r\nvisit to the celebrated convent of San Lazzaro, at Venice. He studied\r\nGeorgian with the assistance of a young man from Teflis, who graduated\r\nin medicine at Bologna. And even from natives of those countries with\r\nthe general language of which he was most familiar, he seldom failed to\r\nlearn some of the peculiarities of local or provincial dialects by which\r\nthe several branches of each are distinguished. In this way he learned\r\nFlemish from some Belgian students of the university. On the other hand,\r\nselect pupils from various parts came to attend his Greek or Oriental\r\nlectures, or to pursue their linguistic studies privately under his\r\ndirection. One of these, the Abate Celestino Cavedoni, now librarian of\r\nthe Este Library at Modena, and one of the most eminent antiquarians\r\nof Italy, was his pupil from 1816 till 1821. With this excellent youth\r\nMezzofanti formed a cordial friendship; and after Cavedoni’s return to\r\nModena, they maintained a steady and affectionate, although not very\r\nfrequent, correspondance until Mezzofanti’s final removal from Bologna.\r\nAnother was Dr. Liborio Veggetti, the present occupant of Mezzofanti’s\r\nancient office in the university library, an office which he owes to the\r\nwarm recommendation of his former master. A third was the still more\r\ndistinguished scholar, Ippolito Rosellini, the associate and successor\r\nof Champollion in his great work on Egyptian antiquities. Rosellini,\r\nwho was a native of Pisa, had distinguished himself so much during his\r\nearly studies in that university, that, on the death of Malanima, the\r\nprofessor of oriental languages, in 1819, Rosellini, then only in his\r\nnineteenth year, was provisionally selected to succeed him. It was\r\nordered, nevertheless, that he should first prepare himself by a regular\r\ncourse of study; and with this view he was sent, at the charge of his\r\ngovernment, to attend in Bologna the lectures of the great master of\r\noriental studies. Mezzofanti entered with all his characteristic kindness\r\nand ardour into the young man’s project. He sent him with a warm letter\r\nof recommendation, May 17, 1823, to his friend De Rossi, at Parma; later\r\nin the same year, by the representation which he made of his industry\r\nand progress, he obtained for him an increase of the pension which had\r\nbeen assigned for his probationary studies; and in the work on the Hebrew\r\nVowel-points,’ which Rosellini published in Bologna,[405] he owed much to\r\nthe kind criticism and advice of his master. He remained at Bologna till\r\n1824, when his appointment was made absolute, and he returned to Pisa to\r\nenter upon its duties. The distinguished after career of Rosellini is\r\nwell-known. I shall only add, that through life he entertained the most\r\ngrateful recollection of his old master, and that, on his return from the\r\nEgyptian expedition, he made a special visit to Rome for the purpose of\r\nseeing him.[406]\r\n\r\nThe Abate Cavedoni, who, on his return to Modena, as we have seen,\r\ncontinued to correspond for many years with Mezzofanti, has kindly\r\ncommunicated to me those of Mezzofanti’s letters which he has preserved.\r\nThey contain some interesting particulars of a portion of his life\r\nregarding which few other notices have been published.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his public lectures in the university and his occupation\r\nas librarian, he still continued to give private instructions in\r\nlanguages. Mr. Francis Hare, elder brother of the late Archdeacon Julius\r\nHare, learned Italian under his direction. The Countess of Granville,\r\nthen residing in the family of her aunt, the Countess Marescalchi,\r\nremembers to have received her first lessons in English from him. A\r\nyoung Franciscan of the principality of Bosnia prepared himself for his\r\nmission by studying Turkish under his tuition. Many other foreigners\r\nwere among his pupils. Indeed, the ordinary routine of his day, as\r\ndetailed by one of his surviving friends in Bologna and confirmed by\r\nhis own letters to Cavedoni, may well excite a feeling of wonder at the\r\nextraordinary energy, which enabled him, from the midst of occupations so\r\ncontinuous and so varied, to steal time for the purpose of increasing,\r\nor even of maintaining, the stores which he had already acquired. He\r\nrose soon after four o’clock, both in winter and in summer; and, after\r\nhis morning prayer and meditation, celebrated mass—in winter at the\r\nearliest light; after which he took a cup of chocolate or coffee. At\r\neight o’clock he gave his daily lecture in the university; thence he\r\npassed to the library, where, as is plain from many circumstances, he\r\nwas generally actively engaged in the duties of his office, although\r\nconstantly interrupted by the visits of strangers. As his apartments were\r\nin the library building, his occupations can hardly be said to have been\r\nsuspended by his frugal dinner, which, according to the national usage,\r\nwas at twelve o’clock, and from which he returned to the library. The\r\nafternoon was occupied with his private pupils. As his habits of eating\r\nand drinking were temperate in the extreme, his supper, (sometimes in his\r\nown apartments, sometimes at the house of his sister or of some other\r\nfriend,) was of the very simplest kind. He continued his studies to a\r\nlate hour; and, even after retiring to bed, he invariably read for a\r\nshort time, till the symptoms of approaching sleep satisfied him that,\r\nwithout fear of loss of time, he might abandon all further thought of\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nSuch were his ordinary every day occupations; and, amply as they may seem\r\nto fill up the circle of twenty-four hours, he contrived, amidst them\r\nall, to find time for many offices of voluntary charity. He was assiduous\r\nin the confessional, and especially in receiving the confessions of\r\nforeigners of every degree. For the spiritual care of all Catholic\r\nforeigners, indeed, he seems to have been regarded as invested with\r\na particular commission. In cases of sickness, especially, he was a\r\nconstant and most cheerful visitor; and there are not a few still living,\r\nof those that visited Bologna during these years, who retain a lively\r\nand grateful recollection of the kindly attentions, and the still more\r\nconsolatory ministrations, for which they were indebted to his ready\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\nAnother extra-official occupation which absorbed a considerable portion\r\nof his time, was the examination of books submitted to him for revision,\r\nparticularly of those connected with his favourite studies. It sometimes\r\nhappened that he received such commissions from Rome. “I cannot reckon,”\r\nhe writes, apologetically, to his friend the abate Cavedoni, “upon a\r\nsingle free moment. The library, my professorship, my private lectures,\r\nthe revision of books, foreigners, well, sick, or dying, do not leave me\r\ntime to breathe. I am fast losing, nay I have already lost, the habit of\r\napplying myself to study; and when, from time to time, I am called on to\r\ndo anything, I find myself reduced to the necessity of improvising.”\r\n\r\nThe most interesting record of this portion of his life will be the\r\nseries of his letters to his friend and pupil Cavedoni, already alluded\r\nto. Unfortunately they are not numerous, and they occur at rather distant\r\nintervals; but they are at least valuable as being perfectly simple and\r\nunstudied, and free, to an extent very unusual in Italian correspondence,\r\nfrom that artificial and ceremonious character which so often destroys in\r\nour eyes the charm of the cleverest foreign correspondence. Cavedoni,\r\nduring his studies at Bologna, had lived on terms of the most cordial\r\nintimacy with his professor and with his family. Mezzofanti’s nephews,\r\nespecially the young abate Joseph Mezzofanti, (whom we shall find\r\ncommemorated in some of these letters under the pet name _Giuseppino_,\r\n_Joe_,) had been his constant companion and friend.\r\n\r\nThe first of these letters was written in reply to one of the ordinary\r\nnew-year’s complimentary letters, which the abate Cavedoni, soon after\r\nhis return to Modena, had addressed to his old professor.\r\n\r\n                                        _Bologna, January 18, 1822._\r\n\r\n    My most esteemed Don Celestino,\r\n\r\n    I did not fail, on the first day of the new year, to pray with\r\n    all my heart that God may ever bestow abundantly upon you His\r\n    best and sweetest graces. May He deign to hear a prayer, which\r\n    I shall never cease to offer! I commend myself in turn to your\r\n    fervent prayers.\r\n\r\n    I am delighted to hear that the abate Baraldi is about to\r\n    employ his various learning and his great zeal so worthily in\r\n    the cause of our holy religion. I shall be most happy to take\r\n    a copy of the “_Memorie_,” which, as I am informed, are about\r\n    to appear under his editorship. May I beg of you to arrange\r\n    that the numbers shall reach me as early as possible after\r\n    publication? They may be sent through the post; but it will be\r\n    necessary to fold the packet in such a way as to let it be seen\r\n    that it is a periodical, in order that it may not be charged\r\n    the full postage. My great object is to receive the numbers at\r\n    the earliest moment, in order that a work which is intended to\r\n    counteract the irreligious principles now unhappily so current,\r\n    may be read as extensively as possible.\r\n\r\n    I shall examine your medal to-morrow, and, should I succeed in\r\n    making anything out of it, I will write to you. Let me know how\r\n    I shall send it back to you.\r\n\r\n    Recollect that we are looking forward here to a visit from\r\n    you with the utmost anxiety. It was a great surprise and\r\n    disappointment to us, not to see you during the late holy\r\n    festivals. Do not forget me, and believe me,\r\n\r\n                  Ever your most affectionate servant,\r\n\r\n                                               D. Joseph Mezzofanti.\r\n\r\nThe journal referred to in this letter is the now voluminous periodical,\r\n“_Memorie di Religione, di Morale, e di Letteratura_,” founded at Modena\r\nin 1822, and continued, with one or two short interruptions, up to the\r\npresent time. The “Abate Baraldi” was a learned ecclesiastic, afterwards\r\narch-priest of Modena.\r\n\r\nCavedoni, since his return to Modena, had been chiefly engaged in\r\narchæological studies, and especially in that of numismatics. He\r\noften consulted Mezzofanti on these subjects, to which, without being\r\na professed antiquarian, the latter had given some attention. In\r\nacknowledgment of this obligation, Cavedoni, several years afterwards,\r\ndedicated to him his Spiecilegio Numismatico.[407]\r\n\r\nThe following letter throws some light on the time and the manner in\r\nwhich his attention was first turned to the Georgian language. The youth\r\nto whom it refers was in Bologna in the year 1820 or 1821.\r\n\r\nCavedoni had apologised for occupying his time by his letters.\r\n\r\n                                           _Bologna, April 5, 1823._\r\n\r\n    My Dear Don Celestino,\r\n\r\n    It will always be a most grateful and pleasing distraction\r\n    for me in the midst of my endless occupations, to receive\r\n    even a line from you. It is true that occasionally I may not\r\n    be able to enjoy this gratification without the drawback\r\n    arising from regret at not having it in my power to reply to\r\n    you immediately; but I trust that you will be able to make\r\n    allowance for me, and that such delays on my part will never\r\n    cause you to suspect that I have ceased to remember you with\r\n    special affection.\r\n\r\n    Of the two works which you mention, that of Father Giorgi\r\n    still maintains the reputation which its author commanded\r\n    during life by his prodigious learning. Will you let me know\r\n    whether the little work in Georgian that you refer to is\r\n    printed or manuscript? You are quite right in supposing that I\r\n    have not thought of that language since the departure of the\r\n    young physician of Teflis, who took his medical degree in our\r\n    university. Alas! what a large proportion of my life is spent\r\n    in teaching! If I but did that well, I might be content; but\r\n    when one does too much, he does nothing as it ought to be done.\r\n\r\n    I had not heard a word of Signor Baraldi’s affliction, for\r\n    which I am much concerned. I trust that, when you write again,\r\n    you will have better news for me. Pray present my special\r\n    compliments to the Librarian.\r\n\r\n    Do not forget me; and, in order that I may know you do not,\r\n    write often to assure me that it is so. Don Giuseppino sends\r\n    you a thousand greetings, and I myself more than a thousand.\r\n\r\n               Ever your most devoted servant and friend,\r\n\r\n                                               D. Joseph Mezzofanti.\r\n\r\nIn this year, Mezzofanti made the acquaintance of the celebrated Duchess\r\nof Devonshire, during one of her visits to the north of Italy. The\r\nsuccess of her magnificent edition of Horace’s Fifth Satire—his journey\r\nto Brundusium—had suggested to her the idea of a similar edition of the\r\nEneid. The first volume, with a series of illustrations, scenical, as\r\nwell as historical, (of Troy, Ithaca, Gaeta, Gabii, &c.,) had appeared in\r\nRome in 1819;[408] and the object of the duchess in this visit, was to\r\nprocure sketches in the locality of Mantua, and especially a sketch of\r\nPietole, the supposed site of the ancient Andes, the place of the poet’s\r\nbirth, upon that plain,\r\n\r\n    ————tardis ingens ubi flexibus errat\r\n    Mincius.\r\n\r\nOne of Mezzofanti’s letters, addressed to his friend Pezzana, shews\r\nthe lengths to which this eccentric lady carried her zeal for the\r\nillustration of this really magnificent work. Although the second volume\r\nhad been already published, and many of the copies had been distributed,\r\nshe continued to add to the number of the illustrations.\r\n\r\n    “Her Grace, the duchess of Devonshire,” he writes, July 6th,\r\n    1823, “on leaving Bologna, commissioned me to forward to you\r\n    the second volume of the Eneid, translated by Caro. In order\r\n    to secure its safe and punctual delivery, I begged the good\r\n    offices of the Abate Crescini, who had just then arrived; and\r\n    he at once undertook it with his usual courtesy. This edition\r\n    has won the admiration of all our artists; and the duchess, not\r\n    content with its present illustrations, has gone to Mantua,\r\n    taking with her another excellent landscape-painter, our\r\n    fellow-citizen, Signor Fantuzzi, to make a sketch of Pietole,\r\n    to be added to the other plates, which already adorn this\r\n    splendid work of art.”\r\n\r\nIn August, 1823, died the venerable Pope Pius VII. The desire, which, on\r\nhis return from captivity, he expressed to secure Mezzofanti’s services\r\nin his own capital, had been repeated subsequently on more than one\r\noccasion. The new Pope, Leo XII., regarded him with equal favour; but his\r\nattachment to home still remained unchanged; and the Pope named him, in\r\n1824, a member of the Collegio dei consultori at Bologna.\r\n\r\nOf his correspondence during this year no portion has come into my hands;\r\nbut there is one of his letters of 1825, (dated April 8th,) which,\r\nalthough it is but an answer to a commonplace letter written to him by\r\nCavedoni, with the catalogue of an expected sale of books, seems worthy\r\nto be preserved, at least as an indication of the direction and progress\r\nof his studies.\r\n\r\n    “It is always difficult,” he writes, “to fix the fair price of\r\n    a class of books which either are not in the market at all, or\r\n    which appear but seldom for sale, chiefly because there are\r\n    but few who seek for such publications. In my case, it becomes\r\n    almost impossible to determine it, as I have no opportunity of\r\n    seeing the books, and very little leisure even to examine the\r\n    catalogue, being obliged to return it in so short a time.\r\n\r\n    “I only venture, therefore, to select a few, which I should be\r\n    disposed to take, provided the price of all together shall not\r\n    exceed forty Roman crowns. Try to make a bargain for me, or at\r\n    all events, endeavour to prevent the books from being either\r\n    scattered or buried in some inaccessible corner.\r\n\r\n    “I should wish then to take the following:—\r\n\r\n    The ‘nine MSS., either extracted from printed books, or of\r\n    uncertain value.’\r\n\r\n    The ‘Grammatica Japonica,’ Romæ No. 22, in the Catalogue.\r\n\r\n    The ‘Grammatica Marasta,’[409] number 32.\r\n\r\n    The ‘Grammatica Linguæ Amharicæ,’[410] number 43.\r\n\r\n    The ‘Osservazioni sulla Lingua albanese,’ number 44.\r\n\r\n    The ‘Grammatica Damulica,’[411] number 46.\r\n\r\n    Benjamin Schulz’s, ‘Grammatica Hindostanica,’ number 50.\r\n\r\n    ‘Chilidugu; sive ses Chilenses,’[412] number 67.\r\n\r\n    And the ‘Catecismo en Lengua Española y Moxa,’[413] No 71.\r\n\r\n    I shall await your reply.”\r\n\r\nOnly one of these works, the “Observations on the Albanese Language,”\r\n(by Francis Maria da Lecce,) appears in the catalogue of Mezzofanti’s\r\nLibrary. Benjamin Schulz’s Tamul Bible and New Testament, are both in\r\nthat catalogue, but not his Hindostani Grammar. Probably the price of\r\nthe books exceeded the very modest limit which Mezzofanti’s humble means\r\ncompelled him to fix.\r\n\r\nIn the August of 1825, he had a visit from the veteran philologist and\r\n_literateur_, Frederic Jacobs, of Gotha. The report of Jacobs may be\r\nconsidered of special importance, as he had been prepared, by the doubts\r\nexpressed as to the credibility of Baron Von Zach’s report, to scrutinize\r\nwith some jealousy the real extent of the attainments thus glowingly\r\ndescribed. It is important, therefore, to note that after quoting all the\r\nmost material portions of Von Zach’s narrative, he fully confirms it from\r\nhis own observations—\r\n\r\n    “I was most kindly received by him,” says Dr. Jacobs: “we spoke\r\n    in German for above an hour, so that I had full opportunity for\r\n    observing the facility with which he spoke; his conversation\r\n    was animated, his vocabulary select and appropriate, his\r\n    pronunciation by no means foreign, and I could detect nothing\r\n    but here and there a little of the North German accent. He was\r\n    not unacquainted with German literature, spoke among other\r\n    things of Voss’s services in the theory of metre, and made\r\n    some observations on the imitation of the metrical system of\r\n    the ancients. His opinions were precise and expressed without\r\n    dogmatism. This fault, so common among persons of talent,\r\n    appears quite foreign to him, and there is not a trace of\r\n    charlatanism about him.”\r\n\r\nAs a somewhat different opinion has been expressed by others, the reader\r\nwill observe the testimony borne by Jacobs, not only to Mezzofanti’s\r\nscholarship and philological attainments in a department but little\r\ncultivated, but also to the “selectness and appropriateness” of his\r\nGerman vocabulary, the “facility with which he spoke,” and the general\r\npurity and correctness of his conversational style.\r\n\r\nHe proceeds to describe another peculiarity of Mezzofanti’s extraordinary\r\nfaculty which is equally deserving of notice, but which no other visitor\r\nwhom we have hitherto seen, has brought out so strongly.\r\n\r\n    “Not less remarkable are the ease and readiness with which\r\n    he passes in conversation from one language to another, from\r\n    the north to the south, from the east to the west, and the\r\n    dexterity with which he speaks several of the most difficult\r\n    together, without the least seeming effort; and whereas,\r\n    in cognate languages, the slightest difference creates\r\n    confusion;—so that, for instance the German in Holland or the\r\n    Dutchman in Germany, often mixes the sister and mother tongues\r\n    so as to become unintelligible;—Mezzofanti ever draws the\r\n    line most sharply, and his path in each realm of languages is\r\n    uniformly firm and secure.”\r\n\r\nWe may also add Professor Jacobs’ description of the personal appearance\r\nof the great linguist at this period of his life.\r\n\r\n    “Mezzofanti,” he says, “is of the middle size, or rather below\r\n    it; he is thin and pale, and his whole appearance indicates\r\n    delicacy. He appears to be between fifty and sixty years old\r\n    [he was really, in 1825, fifty-one]; his movements are easy and\r\n    unembarrassed; his whole bearing is that of a man who has mixed\r\n    much in society. He is active and zealous in the discharge of\r\n    his duties, and never fails to celebrate mass every day.”[414]\r\n\r\nI have thought it necessary to draw the reader’s attention to these\r\npoints, in reference to Mezzofanti’s German, in order that he may compare\r\nthem with the observations of Dr. Tholuck, Chevalier Bunsen, Guido\r\nGörres, and other distinguished Germans, who visited him at a later\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nAll his later letters to the Abate Cavedoni, which are filled with\r\napologies for his tardiness as a correspondent, tell the same story of\r\nceaseless occupation.\r\n\r\n    “A Franciscan friar of the Bosnian province,” he writes,\r\n    November 23rd, 1825, “who has been learning Turkish with me\r\n    for the purposes of his mission in Bosnia, being on his way\r\n    to Modena, has called to inquire whether I have any occasion\r\n    to write to that city. The remorse which I feel at not having\r\n    written to you for so long a time, makes it impossible for me\r\n    to give a denial; and I write this letter, into which I wish\r\n    I could crowd all the expressions of gratitude which I owe to\r\n    you for your constant and faithful remembrance of one, who,\r\n    although he certainly never forgets you, yet rarely gives you,\r\n    at least in writing, the smallest evidence of his remembrance.\r\n\r\n    The truth is that I should only be too happy to do so, and that\r\n    it would seem to me but a renewal of the pleasant literary\r\n    discussions which we used to hold with one another here. But\r\n    unfortunately, I am too much occupied to indulge myself with\r\n    this relaxation. I say this, however, only to excuse myself;\r\n    for I assure you that I look eagerly for letters from you, and\r\n    that it is a great comfort to me to receive one.\r\n\r\n    As regards those words terminating in _ite_ which are now\r\n    commonly used by medical writers, although their formation is\r\n    not grammatically exact, and although they do not precisely\r\n    correspond with those which were employed by the ancients,\r\n    yet as they have now obtained general currency, it would be\r\n    hyper-critical and useless to seek to reform them. You may\r\n    satisfy grammarians by a brief annotation to show that you do\r\n    not overlook what is due to their art—I mean of course Greek\r\n    grammarians; for I suppose our own grammarians will perhaps\r\n    prefer the termination which has been sanctioned by use, and\r\n    which may possibly appear to them less disagreeable. You see\r\n    that I am but repeating your own opinion, and if I did not\r\n    write sooner to you on the subject, it was because my own\r\n    judgment fully agreed with what you had expressed in your\r\n    letter.\r\n\r\n    I congratulate you on the success of your brother’s studies. I\r\n    have been much gratified by the learning, the industry, and the\r\n    zeal for religion, which he has displayed. Offer him my best\r\n    thanks.\r\n\r\n    Remember me in your prayers: write to me, and believe me\r\n    unchangingly yours.”\r\n\r\nThe same regrets are still more strikingly expressed in the following\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n    “I have been wishing, for several days past, to write and thank\r\n    you heartily for your kindness towards me, but it is only this\r\n    day that I have been able to steal a moment for the purpose.\r\n    Be assured that I do not forget how patiently you bore with\r\n    me, while, in the midst of the thousand distractions to which\r\n    I was liable, we were reading together the Greek and Oriental\r\n    languages. If I recall to your recollection the manner of my\r\n    life at that time, and the ever recurring interruptions of my\r\n    studies, it is only for the purpose of letting you see that, as\r\n    the same state of things still continues, or rather has been\r\n    changed for the worse, I have not time to show my gratitude\r\n    for your constant remembrance of me. Still I thank you from my\r\n    heart for it.\r\n\r\n    I have not been able to read much of your Tasso, but I have\r\n    observed some readings which appear to me very happy. I told\r\n    Count Valdrighi, that I intended to write to you about the\r\n    volume which Monsignor Mai has just published, to request\r\n    that you, or some others of your friends in Modena, would\r\n    take copies of it, as I have some to dispose of. I have since\r\n    learned that you are already supplied. I beg, nevertheless,\r\n    that you will take some public occasion to recommend it. I\r\n    would do so willingly myself, but I cannot find a single free\r\n    moment. The library, my professorship, my private lectures, the\r\n    examination of books, the visits of strangers, the attendance\r\n    on sick or dying foreigners, do not leave me time to breathe.\r\n    In all this I possess one singular advantage—the excellent\r\n    health with which I am blessed. But on the other hand, I am\r\n    losing, or indeed I have already lost, my habit of application;\r\n    and now, if I am called from time to time to do anything, I\r\n    find myself reduced to the necessity of improvising.\r\n\r\n    Forgive me, my dear Don Celestino, for entering thus minutely\r\n    into my own affairs. Set it down to the account of our\r\n    friendship, in the name of which I beg of you to remember me\r\n    in your prayers. Continue to write to me as of old; for, in\r\n    the midst of my heaviest occupations, I receive your letters\r\n    with the greatest pleasure, and find a real enjoyment in them,\r\n    and in the reminiscences which they bring with them of the\r\n    happiness that I formerly enjoyed in your dear society.\r\n\r\n    My sister and my nephews present their most cordial greetings.\r\n\r\n                                        _Bologna, March, 27, 1826._”\r\n\r\nIt is about this time that we may date the commencement of that intimacy\r\nbetween Mezzofanti and Cardinal Cappellari, afterwards Pope Gregory\r\nXVI., which eventually led to Mezzofanti’s removal from Bologna to Rome.\r\nCappellari, a distinguished monk of the Camaldolese order, was named to\r\nthe cardinalate early in 1826; and soon afterwards was placed at the\r\nhead of the congregation of the Propaganda. Being himself an orientalist\r\nof considerable eminence, he had long admired the wonderful gifts of\r\nMezzofanti, and a circumstance occurred soon after his nomination as\r\nprefect of the Propaganda, which led to a correspondence between them,\r\nin reference to an oriental liturgical manuscript on which the opinion\r\nof the great linguist was desired. Cardinal Cappellari forwarded the\r\nMS. to Mezzofanti, who in a short time returned it, not merely with an\r\nexplanation, but with a complete Latin translation. The Cardinal was\r\nso grateful for this service, that he wrote to thank the translator,\r\naccompanying his letter with a draft for a hundred doubloons. Mezzofanti,\r\nwith a disinterestedness which his notoriously straitened means made\r\nstill more honourable, at once wrote to return the draft, with a request\r\nthat it should be applied to the purposes of the missions of the\r\nPropaganda.[415]\r\n\r\nThis appeal from Cardinal Cappellari was not a solitary one. Mezzofanti\r\nwas not unfrequently consulted in the same way, sometimes on critical\r\nor bibliographical questions, sometimes as to the character or contents\r\nof a book or MS. in some unknown language. One of his letters to the\r\nabate Cavedoni is a long account of an early Latin version of two of St.\r\nGregory Nazianzen’s minor spiritual poems, the “Tetrasticha” and the\r\n“Monosticha.” As this letter (although not without interest as being the\r\nonly specimen of his critical writings which I have been able to obtain)\r\nwould have little attraction for the general reader, and throws but\r\nlittle light upon the narrative, it is unnecessary to translate it.[416]\r\nThere is another letter, however, of nearly the same period, addressed\r\nto his friend count Valdrighi of Modena, on the subject of a MS. in the\r\nBirman language submitted by the count for his examination, which will be\r\nread with more curiosity.\r\n\r\n    _To Count Mario Valdrighi._\r\n\r\n    “I have to reproach myself for not being more prompt in my\r\n    acknowledgement of your polite letter; or rather I regret the\r\n    resolution which I formed of delaying my answer in the hope\r\n    of being able to make it more satisfactory; since thus it\r\n    has turned out, that while I was only waiting in the hope of\r\n    being able to reply with greater accuracy, I have incurred the\r\n    suspicion of discourtesy, by delaying to send you the little\r\n    information regarding your oriental MS. which I possessed at\r\n    the time, and which I regret to say is all that even still I am\r\n    possessed of.\r\n\r\n    Although your MS. is the first in these characters that I\r\n    have ever seen, yet I recognized it at once as a MS. written,\r\n    or, I should more correctly say, _graven_, in Burmese, the\r\n    native language of the kingdom of Ava, and the language also\r\n    which is used by all persons of cultivation in the dependent\r\n    provinces of that kingdom. I was enabled to recognize the form\r\n    of the characters from having once seen the alphabet, which\r\n    was printed by the Propaganda, first in 1776, and again in\r\n    1787.[417]\r\n\r\n    As my knowledge in reference to the language when I received\r\n    your letter, did not extend any farther, I was unable to give\r\n    you any other information regarding your MS. except that it\r\n    is composed of that species of palm leaves which they use in\r\n    that country, for the purpose of inscribing or engraving their\r\n    written characters thereon. The tree, which does not differ\r\n    much in appearance from the other species of palm, is said\r\n    to live for a hundred years, and then to die as soon as it\r\n    has produced its fruit; but perhaps it may be said to live on\r\n    by preserving on its leaves the writings which they wish to\r\n    transmit to posterity. It is called in Burmese (or Birmese) by\r\n    the name of _Ole_.\r\n\r\n    You will ask what is the character of their writings. The\r\n    people are said to be ignorant in the extreme, and even the\r\n    class called _Talapuini_, who live together in community in a\r\n    sort of Pythagorean college, possess but very little learning.\r\n    Their studies are confined to two books, written in a peculiar\r\n    character, one entitled _Kammua_, the other _Padinot_.[418]\r\n    The Barnabite Fathers also, who founded several churches in\r\n    Ava, and preached the gospel with incredible zeal all over\r\n    those vast regions, have written in the native language,\r\n    several useful books calculated to maintain and increase the\r\n    fruit of their apostolic labours. The most remarkable of\r\n    them was Mgr. Peristo, who wrote and spoke the language with\r\n    great perfection, and whose life has been written by the late\r\n    distinguished Father Michael Angelo Griffini.\r\n\r\n    I was about to write all this to you as soon as I first\r\n    received your MS., but I was anxious to be able to tell you\r\n    something more; and with this view, I waited for a long time\r\n    in the hope of obtaining from Paris, Carey’s Birmese Grammar,\r\n    published at Serampore in 1814, and some other books besides;\r\n    as such books must necessarily be in existence, now that the\r\n    English have added to their Indian possessions a large tract of\r\n    the Birmese Empire. But unfortunately, these books either are\r\n    not to be had at Paris, or have not been carefully sought for.\r\n\r\n    Accordingly, after all these months of delay, I return you your\r\n    Birmese MS. written on the leaves of the Ole palm. It has most\r\n    probably found its way to Italy through some missionary, and\r\n    perhaps was written by a missionary. This, however, will likely\r\n    be discoverable from the facts which are known as to the place\r\n    whence it came.\r\n\r\n    The information which I am able to give is, you see, very\r\n    little compared with what you might have expected, and bears a\r\n    still smaller proportion to my desire to oblige you. I should\r\n    have wished to translate it all for you, had it been in my\r\n    power, if it were only as a means of expressing my gratitude\r\n    and my homage to one from whom I receive so many kindnesses,\r\n    and to whom I am indebted for so many charming books, either\r\n    composed or illustrated by himself. For all these favours it\r\n    only remains for me to offer you my most unbounded thanks. I\r\n    trust that, if you should chance to honour me again with any\r\n    commission, I shall be able to execute it more successfully,\r\n    or at all events more satisfactorily. I will at least promise\r\n    not to delay as I have now done, in the hope of obtaining more\r\n    information; but, relying that your kindness will lead you to\r\n    accept what little explanation I shall be able to afford from\r\n    myself, I will at least endeavour to show my anxious wish to\r\n    oblige by the promptness of my reply.”\r\n\r\nNeither Carey’s Birman Grammar, nor any other modern book on the subject,\r\nappears in the catalogue of Mezzofanti’s library. It comprises, however,\r\na few Birman books, amongst which are the two alphabets referred to in\r\nthe above letter, a translation of Bellarmine’s “Doctrina Christiana,”\r\nand an “Explanation of the Catechism for the use of the Birmese.” These\r\nbooks (all printed at the Propaganda press) appear to have been procured\r\nafter his removal to Rome, where by private study and by intercourse with\r\na few Birmese students in the Propaganda, he acquired the language, as we\r\nshall see, sufficiently for the purposes of conversation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n[1828-1830.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1828, the Crown Prince of Prussia, (now King Frederic\r\nWilliam,) while passing through Bologna, on his way to Rome, sought\r\nan interview with Mezzofanti. In common with all other visitors, he\r\nwas struck with wonder at the marvellous variety and accuracy of his\r\nknowledge of languages. On his arrival at Rome, he spoke admiringly of\r\nthis interview to Dr. Tholuck, the present distinguished professor of\r\nTheology at Halle, (at that time chaplain of the Prussian Embassy in\r\nRome,) who has kindly communicated the particulars to me. “The prince\r\nurged me,” says Dr. Tholuck, in an exceedingly interesting letter which\r\nshall be inserted later, “not to leave Italy without having seen him. ‘He\r\nis truly a miracle,’ exclaimed the prince; ‘he spoke German with me, like\r\na German; with my Privy-Councillor Ancillon, he spoke the purest French;\r\nwith Bunsen, English; with General Gröben, Swedish.’ ‘And what is still\r\nmore wonderful,’ subjoined M. Bunsen, then minister resident in Rome,\r\n‘all these languages he has learnt by books alone, without any teacher.’”\r\nThis opinion of M. Bunsen’s, Dr. Tholuck afterwards ascertained to be a\r\nmistake, or at least an exaggeration.\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless to the lessons of his early master, Father Thiulen,\r\nthat he owed the knowledge of Swedish which enabled him to converse with\r\nGeneral Gröben. A still more distinct evidence of his familiarity with it\r\noccurred on occasion of the visit of the Crown Prince (now King) Oscar of\r\nSweden to Bologna. M. Braunerhjelm, now Hof-Stallmastäre at Stockholm,\r\nwho was present at the prince’s interview with Mezzofanti, assured Mr.\r\nWackerbarth, who was good enough to make the inquiry for me last year,\r\nthat “the abate spoke the language quite perfectly.” According to another\r\naccount which I have received, the prince, having suddenly changed the\r\nconversation into a dialect peculiar to one of the provinces of Sweden,\r\nMezzofanti was obliged to confess his inability to understand him. What\r\nwas his amazement, in a subsequent interview, to hear Mezzofanti address\r\nhim in this very dialect!\r\n\r\n“From whom, in the name of all that is wonderful, have you learnt it?”\r\nexclaimed the prince.\r\n\r\n“From your Royal Highness,” replied Mezzofanti. “Your conversation\r\nyesterday supplied me with a key to all that is peculiar in its forms,\r\nand I am merely translating the common words into this form.”\r\n\r\nThe Countess of Blessington, in the third volume of her “Idler in\r\nItaly,” has given an account of her intercourse with Mezzofanti during\r\nthis year. She adds but little to the facts already known as to\r\nMezzofanti’s linguistic attainments; but it may not be uninteresting\r\nto contrast with the ponderous and matter of fact sketches of the\r\nprofessional scholars whom we have hitherto been considering, the\r\nlighter, but in many respects more striking portraiture of a lady\r\nvisitor, less capable of estimating the solidity of his learning, but\r\nmore alive to the minor peculiarities of his manner, to the more delicate\r\nshades of his character and disposition, and to the thousand minuter\r\nspecialities, which, after all, go to form our idea of the man.\r\n\r\nLady Blessington had been present at the solemn mass in the church of St.\r\nPetronius at Bologna on the morning of the Festival of the Assumption. An\r\nadventure which befel her at the close of the ceremony led to her first\r\nmeeting with the great linguist, which she thus pleasantly describes.\r\n\r\n    “While viewing the procession beneath the arcades, I was\r\n    inadvertently separated from my party, and found myself\r\n    hurried along by the crowd, hemmed in at all sides by a moving\r\n    mass of strangers who seemed to eye me with much curiosity.\r\n    To disentangle myself from the multitude would have been\r\n    a difficult, if not an impossible task; and I confess I\r\n    experienced a certain degree of trepidation, inseparable from\r\n    a woman’s feelings, at finding myself alone in the midst of\r\n    a vast throng not one face of which I had ever previously\r\n    seen. Great then was my satisfaction at hearing the simple\r\n    remark of ‘We have had a very fine day for the fête,’ uttered\r\n    in English, and with as good a pronunciation as possible, by\r\n    a person having the air and dress of a clergyman, to another\r\n    who answered: ‘Yes, nothing could be more propitious than the\r\n    weather.’\r\n\r\n    Though it is always embarrassing to address a stranger, the\r\n    sound of my own language, and the position in which I was\r\n    placed, gave me courage to touch the arm of the first speaker,\r\n    and to state, that being separated from my party, I must\r\n    request the protection of my countryman. He turned round,\r\n    saluted me graciously, said that, though not a countryman, he\r\n    would gladly assist me to rejoin my party, and immediately\r\n    placed me between him and his companion.\r\n\r\n    ‘You speak English perfectly, yet are not an Englishman!’ said\r\n    I. ‘Then you can be no other than professor Mezzofanti?’\r\n\r\n    Both he and his companion smiled, and he answered; ‘My name\r\n    _is_ Mezzofanti.’\r\n\r\n    I had a letter of introduction from a mutual friend, and,\r\n    intending to leave it for him in the course of the day, I had\r\n    put it into my reticule, whence I immediately drew it and gave\r\n    it to him. He knew the hand-writing at a single glance, and,\r\n    with great good breeding, put it unopened into his pocket,\r\n    saying something too flattering for me to repeat, in which the\r\n    remark, that a good countenance was the best recommendation,\r\n    was neatly turned. He presented his companion to me, who\r\n    happened to be the Abbé Scandalaria, then staying on a visit to\r\n    him, and who speaks English remarkably well.\r\n\r\n    My party were not a little surprised to see me rejoin them,\r\n    accompanied by and in conversation with two strangers. When\r\n    I presented them to my new acquaintances, they were much\r\n    amused at the recital of my unceremonious encounter and\r\n    self-introduction to Mezzofanti, who not only devoted a\r\n    considerable portion of the day to us, but promised to spend\r\n    the evening at our hotel, and invited us to breakfast with him\r\n    to-morrow.\r\n\r\n    The countenance of the wonderful linguist is full of\r\n    intelligence, his manner well-bred, unaffected and highly\r\n    agreeable. His facility and felicity in speaking French,\r\n    German, and English, is most extraordinary, and I am told it\r\n    is not less so in various other languages. He is a younger\r\n    man than I expected to find him, and, with the vast erudition\r\n    he has acquired, is totally exempt from pretension or\r\n    pedantry.”[419]\r\n\r\nAn adventure with Mezzofanti, quite similar to Lady Blessington’s, befel\r\na party of Irish ecclesiastical students on their way to Rome in the very\r\nsame year. They arrived at Bologna late in the afternoon, and, as they\r\npurposed proceeding on their journey early on the following morning, they\r\nwere unwilling to lose the opportunity of seeing and conversing with\r\nthe celebrated professor. Accordingly they repaired to the university\r\nlibrary; but, as might be expected at so late an hour, they found the\r\nlibrary closed and the galleries silent and deserted. After wandering\r\nabout for a considerable time, in search of some one to whom to address\r\nan inquiry, they at last saw an abate of very humble and unpretending\r\nappearance approach. The spokesman of the party begged of him, in the\r\nbest Latin he could summon up at the moment, to point out the way to the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\n“Do you wish to see the library?” asked the abate without a moment’s\r\npause, in English, and with an excellent accent.\r\n\r\nThe student was thunderstruck. “By Jove, boys,” he exclaimed turning to\r\nhis companions, “this is Mezzofanti himself!”\r\n\r\nIt _was_ Mezzofanti; and, on learning that they were Irish, he addressed\r\nthem a few words in their native language, to which they were obliged\r\nto confess their inability to reply. One of the number, however, having\r\nlearned the language from books, Mezzofanti entered into a conversation\r\nwith him on its supposed analogies with Welsh.\r\n\r\nOf this party, five in number, four are now no more. The sole survivor,\r\nReverend Philip Meyler of Wexford, still retains a lively recollection\r\nnot only of the fluency and precision of Mezzofanti’s English, but of the\r\nfriendly warmth with which he received them, of the interest which he\r\nmanifested in the object of their journey, and of the cordiality of the\r\n“_Iter bonum faustumque!_” with which he took his leave.\r\n\r\nThe clergyman alluded to by Lady Blessington, as the “Abbé Scandalaria,”\r\nwas, in reality, Padre Scandellari,[420] a learned priest of the\r\ncongregation of the Scuole Pie, and one of Mezzofanti’s especial friends.\r\nI was assured by the late Lady Bellew, who knew Padre Scandellari at this\r\nperiod, that he spoke English quite as well as Mezzofanti. Her ladyship,\r\n(at that time Mademoiselle de Mendoza y Rios) was presented to Mezzofanti\r\nby this father, a few weeks after the visit of Lady Blessington. She was\r\naccompanied by the late Bishop Gradwell, ex-rector of the English College\r\nat Rome, and by her governess, Madame de Chaussegros,[421] a native of\r\nMarseilles. Mezzofanti conversed fluently with Dr. Gradwell in English,\r\nand with Mdlle. de Mendoza, who was a linguist of no common attainments,\r\nin English, French, and Spanish; and when he learned that her companion\r\nwas a Marseillaise, he at once addressed her in the Provençal dialect,\r\nwhich, as the delighted Marseillaise declared, he spoke almost with the\r\ngrace and propriety of a native of Provence.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the Crown Prince of Prussia, on his arrival at\r\nRome, counselled Dr. Tholuck not to return to Germany, without visiting\r\nthe Bolognese prodigy. Having heard of this interview, which took place\r\nwhile Dr. Tholuck was returning to Germany, in 1829, I was naturally\r\nanxious to learn what was the impression made upon this distinguished\r\norientalist, by a visit which may be said to have been undertaken with\r\nthe professed design of testing by a critical examination the reality of\r\nthe accomplishment of which fame had spoken so unreservedly. Dr. Tholuck,\r\nwith a courtesy which I gratefully acknowledge, at once forwarded to\r\nme a most interesting account of his interview, a portion of which has\r\nbeen already inserted. Dr. Tholuck is known as one of the most eminent\r\nlinguists of modern Germany. From the clear and idiomatic English of his\r\nletter, the reader may infer what are his capabilities, as a critical\r\njudge of the same faculty in another. After mentioning M. Bunsen’s\r\nstatement, that Mezzofanti had learned his languages entirely from books,\r\nDr. Tholuck continues:—\r\n\r\n    “This seemed the more incredible to me, having just made the\r\n    experience as to Italian, how impossible it is to acquire the\r\n    niceties of conversational language only from books. On my\r\n    return from Rome, having arrived at Bologna, I considered it my\r\n    first duty to call on that eminent linguist, accompanied by a\r\n    young Dane who was conversant also with the Frisian language,\r\n    spoken only by a small remnant of that old nation in Sleswic\r\n    or Friesland. Mezzofanti having commenced the conversation\r\n    in German, I continued it a quarter of an hour in my native\r\n    language. He spoke it fluently, but not without some slighter\r\n    mistakes, of which, in that space of time, I noticed as many\r\n    as four, which I took notes of immediately after; nor was the\r\n    accent a pure German accent, but that of Poles and Bohemians\r\n    when they speak German, which is to be accounted for from\r\n    his having acquired that language from individuals of that\r\n    nation, from Austrian soldiers. Upon this I suddenly turned my\r\n    conversation into Arabic, having obtained an easy practice in\r\n    this language by long intercourse with a family in which it\r\n    was spoken. Mezzofanti made his reply in Arabic without any\r\n    hesitation, quite correctly, but very slowly, composing one\r\n    word with the other, from want of practice. I then turned upon\r\n    Dutch, which he did not know then, but replied in Flemish, a\r\n    kindred dialect. English and Spanish he spoke with the greatest\r\n    fluency, but when addressed in Danish he replied in Swedish.\r\n    The Frisian he had not yet heard of. When requested to write\r\n    a line for me, he retired in his study, and, as we had been\r\n    talking together on the Persian, which at that time had been\r\n    my chief study, and which he was able to converse in, though\r\n    very slowly, and composing only words, as was my own case\r\n    likewise, he wrote for me a fine Persian distich of his own\r\n    composition, though only after long meditation in his study.\r\n    In the mean while he permitted me to examine his library.\r\n    Turning up a Cornish (of the dialect of Cornwall) Grammar, I\r\n    found in it some sheets containing a little vocabulary and\r\n    grammatical paradigms, and he told me that his way of learning\r\n    new languages was no other but that of our school-boys, by\r\n    writing out paradigms and words, and committing to memory. As\r\n    to the statement of M. Bunsen, mentioned before, it was not\r\n    confirmed by Mezzofanti’s communication: he confessed to have\r\n    acquired the conversational language chiefly from foreigners in\r\n    the hospitals, in part from missionaries. The number he then\r\n    professed to know _well_ was upwards of twenty; those which\r\n    he knew imperfectly, almost the same number. Of the poetical\r\n    productions of several nations he spoke as a man of taste, but\r\n    what we call the philosophy of language he did not seem yet to\r\n    have entered upon.”\r\n\r\nDr. Tholuck, it will be seen, did not suffer himself to be carried\r\naway by the enthusiasm of those who had gone before him. He had eyes\r\nfor faults as well as for excellencies. Nevertheless, the reader will\r\nprobably agree with me in thinking the undisguised admiration which\r\npervades his calm and circumstantial statement, even with the drawbacks\r\nwhich it contains, a more solid tribute to the fame of Mezzofanti than\r\nthe declamatory eulogies of a crowd of uninquiring enthusiasts. There\r\nis an irresistible guarantee for his trustworthiness as a reporter upon\r\nMezzofanti’s German, in the fact that he did not fail to take “a note\r\nof the four minor mistakes,” into which Mezzofanti fell in the course\r\nof their conversation;[422] and one cannot hesitate to receive without\r\nsuspicion what he tells of his “speaking Arabic and Persian without any\r\nhesitation, and quite correctly,” when we find him carefully distinguish\r\nbetween these and the other languages on which he tried him, and note\r\nthat in these he proceeded “very slowly, composing one word with another\r\nfor want of practice.” It is proper, however, to add that the opportunity\r\nof practice which he afterwards enjoyed at Rome, entirely removed this\r\ndifficulty: and the fluency and ease with which Mezzofanti there spoke\r\nthese most difficult languages, is the best confirmation of Dr. Tholuck’s\r\nsagacity in ascribing the hesitation which was observable at the time of\r\nhis visit to want of practice alone.\r\n\r\nDr. Tholuck’s letter is specially important, also, as establishing the\r\nfact that Mezzofanti’s acquisitions were by no means so easy, or so much\r\nthe result of a species of instinctive intuition as has been commonly\r\nsupposed. Many of the circumstances which Dr. Tholuck notes, indicate\r\nlabour; all point plainly to successive stages of advancement, to various\r\ndegrees of perfection, in a word, to all the ordinary accompaniments\r\nof progress. The little vocabulary and grammatical paradigms of the\r\nCornish language, an extinct and almost forgotten dialect,[423]\r\nwhich even our English philologists have come to disregard, tell of\r\nthemselves the character of the man. Of course the main attraction of\r\nthe Cornish dialect for him, was as one of the representatives of the\r\nold British family; but it cannot be doubted that he took a pleasure in\r\nthe systematic pursuit of the structure of a language for the mere sake\r\nof the mental exercise which it involved. I am assured by the Cavalier\r\nMinarelli that the deceased Cardinal’s books and papers[424] contain many\r\nsuch grammatical and phraseological skeletons, even in languages which\r\nmight be supposed to have less interest than that in the study of which\r\nDr. Tholuck found him engaged.[425]\r\n\r\nIn reply to further inquiries which I addressed to him, Dr. Tholuck added:\r\n\r\n    “Among the twenty languages which he then professed to know\r\n    accurately, he pointed out specially the English and the\r\n    Albanese; among these he professed to know imperfectly, was\r\n    also the Quichua, or old Peruvian, which he learned from some\r\n    of the American missionaries. He mentioned that he was then\r\n    engaged in learning the Bimbarra language, studying it from a\r\n    catechism translated by a French missionary; an instance which\r\n    shows that his _knowing_ a language was in _some_ instances\r\n    nothing more than having got a smattering of it, as the\r\n    Americans say.[426]\r\n\r\n    As to the Persian distich, which it took him about half an\r\n    hour to compose, it was an imitation of the distichs in Sadi’s\r\n    _Gulistan_,[427] and contained, as is the case with these\r\n    distichs, some elegant ἐνθύμησεις.”\r\n\r\nWhether, at any subsequent time, he acquired the Frisian dialect, of\r\nwhich “he had not yet heard” when Dr. Tholuck visited him, I am unable to\r\npronounce from any positive information. But I find in his catalogue[428]\r\nseveral volumes in this language (to which it is highly probable that\r\nthis interview called his attention;) not merely elementary books, such\r\nas Rasck’s _Friesche Spraakleer_, but historical works, as for instance,\r\nWissers’ History, and even such light literature as Japiek’s Collection\r\nof Frisian Poetry.[429] From his known habits I can hardly doubt that,\r\nonce having acquired these books, he must at least have made some\r\nprogress towards mastering their contents.\r\n\r\nThe abate Ubaldo Fabiani, a young Modenese priest of much promise, who,\r\nafter completing his studies, had been appointed lecturer in sacred\r\nScripture and Hebrew in his native university, came to Bologna in 1829,\r\nwith letters from the abate Cavedoni to Mezzofanti, under whom he\r\nproposed to perfect himself in Hebrew and other Oriental languages.\r\nMezzofanti received him with the utmost cordiality; and the great ability\r\nand industry which he exhibited, as well as his exceeding amiableness and\r\nunaffected piety, completely won the heart of his master. On his return\r\nto Modena, after a residence of a few months, Mezzofanti wrote to his\r\nfriend Cavedoni.\r\n\r\n                                        _Bologna, 17 October, 1829._\r\n\r\n    “Don Ubaldo Fabiani is just about to return to Modena, after\r\n    a sojourn of three months here, the entire of which he has\r\n    passed in the midst of books. It would be impossible for me to\r\n    describe to you the assiduity, avidity, and perseverance, with\r\n    which I have seen him apply to his studies; but I can safely\r\n    say that the fruit which he has derived from them has even\r\n    exceeded the labour, as he unites with unwearied diligence a\r\n    ready wit and a peculiar aptitude for this branch of learning.\r\n    The principal object of his attention has been the sacred\r\n    Hebrew text; but he has also applied himself to Chaldee, and in\r\n    the end to the Rabbinical Hebrew—in all cases with most rapid\r\n    progress. Had his time not been so limited, he had intended\r\n    to devote himself also to Arabic—a language which has of late\r\n    become so necessary an appliance of the polemics of sacred\r\n    Scripture. But I have every confidence that he will do this\r\n    also, when he shall return another year to Bologna; and I shall\r\n    be more than willing to accompany him in this study also.\r\n\r\n    I am much indebted to you for having given me an opportunity\r\n    of forming the acquaintance of so worthy an ecclesiastic. I\r\n    have to thank you also for your learned publications, which\r\n    you were kind enough to send me, and which, in the midst of\r\n    all my varied occupations, are a source of real pleasure to\r\n    me. Forgive my irregularity and tardiness as a correspondent;\r\n    or rather do you return good for evil, by writing to me the\r\n    more frequently. You will thus do what is most grateful to your\r\n    devoted friend.”\r\n\r\nFabiani had hardly reached Modena when he was seized with fever—the\r\nterrible _perniciosa_ of the Italian summer and autumn—and was carried\r\noff after an illness of a few days, at the early age of twenty-four. As\r\nsoon as the melancholy news reached Bologna, Mezzofanti wrote once more\r\nto his friend Cavedoni.\r\n\r\n                                       _Bologna, November 12, 1829._\r\n\r\n    “Death has snatched Don Ubaldo from us! Alas, how much have we\r\n    lost in him!—how miserably have we seen all the hopes which we\r\n    placed in him, cut off in a single moment! What might we not\r\n    have expected from a young ecclesiastic, so entirely devoted to\r\n    piety and to letters!\r\n\r\n    As for himself, his only aspirations were for heaven. His\r\n    studies had no other end or aim, save God: and God has been\r\n    pleased to take him to Himself, crowning with an early reward a\r\n    virtue which, even in the first flower of years, had attained\r\n    to its full maturity. Ah, let us hope that our dear Don Ubaldo,\r\n    now close to the Divine Fountain, is there admitted to the\r\n    hidden source of the divine oracles, to the study of which he\r\n    addressed himself here with such indefatigable application. Now\r\n    he will recall to memory, the affectionate care bestowed upon\r\n    him here by his parents, by his dear Don Celestino, and even by\r\n    his last master—last in merit as well as in time—and will feel\r\n    the force of the words which I often repeated to him, never\r\n    with more tenderness than at our last parting—‘Ah, Don Ubaldo,\r\n    give thyself entirely to the Lord!’ He feels now, I confidently\r\n    trust, what a thing it is to ‘belong entirely to the Lord.’\r\n\r\n    Ah, my dear Don Celestino, I should not be acting worthily, if,\r\n    on such an event, I gave room for a single moment to earthly\r\n    thoughts. Our friend has flown to heaven:—let our hearts also\r\n    turn thither, where we hope to meet him in everlasting joy.\r\n    Assist me by your prayers to attain this end. When you see\r\n    our deceased friend’s parents, comfort them with the true and\r\n    blessed consolations which our holy religion bestows; and let\r\n    us when, in the Adorable Sacrifice, we offer prayers for those\r\n    who are in tribulation, never fail to pray for each other, and\r\n    continually strive to disentangle ourselves more and more from\r\n    the vanity of the world.”\r\n\r\nThe premature death of this excellent young clergyman was felt at Modena\r\nas a real calamity. His friend, the abate Cavedoni, published these\r\nsimple but touching letters of Mezzofanti in the _Memorie_[430] of\r\nModena, as the best testimony which could be offered to the rare merit of\r\nthe deceased; but, although already known in Italy, they are well worthy\r\nof being preserved, not merely as a tribute to the memory of the youth\r\nwhose death they record, but as representing most truthfully the piety,\r\nthe sensibility, the fervour, and above all, the amiable and affectionate\r\ndisposition, of the writer himself.\r\n\r\nSoon after the date of these letters was founded at Bologna a literary\r\nAcademy, which has some interest in connexion with the history of\r\nMezzofanti. Like many of the older learned societies of Italy,[431]\r\nit took to itself a somewhat fanciful designation, although one which\r\nfalls far short in oddity of those of many among its predecessors;—as\r\nthe _Oziosi_, or the _Inquieti_, of Bologna, the _Insensati_ of Perugia,\r\nthe _Assorditi_ of Urbino, or (strangest of all), the _Umidi_[432] of\r\nFlorence, who carried the fancy so far as to designate themselves by the\r\nnames of fish and water-fowls. Mezzofanti and his fellow Academicians\r\ncontented themselves with the less startling, though somewhat affected,\r\ntitle of _Filopieri_, “Lovers of the Muses.” Their Society received the\r\nformal approval of the Congregation of Studies, in the beginning of 1830,\r\nand commenced to hold its meetings in the same year. But, in connexion\r\nwith the life of Mezzofanti, it is chiefly memorable for a curious volume\r\nof verses, addressed to him by the members, on the occasion of his\r\nelevation to the Cardinalate.[433]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n[1831.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto the Abate Mezzofanti has appeared chiefly, if not exclusively,\r\nas a linguist; and the estimate of his attainments which has long been\r\ncurrent, assumes him to have cultivated that single accomplishment to\r\nthe exclusion of all other branches of study. The report, however, of a\r\nvisitor, who saw him about the time at which we have now arrived, will be\r\nfound to present him in a new character.\r\n\r\nIn introducing this notice of him, a brief preliminary explanation\r\nwill be necessary—perhaps, indeed, this explanation is indispensable\r\neven in itself; for, although the political history of the period does\r\nnot properly fall within the scope of this biography, yet, as the most\r\nimportant event in the life of Mezzofanti—the transfer of his residence\r\nto Rome—arose directly out of his mission to that capital at the\r\ntermination of the Revolution of 1831, it is necessary to revert, at\r\nleast in outline, to the most notable occurrences of the preceding years.\r\n\r\nThe discontent and turbulence which marked the closing years of the\r\nreign of Pius VII. had in great measure subsided under the impartial\r\nbut vigorous administration of Leo XII.; nor was the short pontificate\r\nof his successor, Pius VIII. who succeeded on the 31st of March,\r\n1829, interrupted by any overt expression of popular discontent. It\r\nwas well known, nevertheless, throughout this whole period, that an\r\nactive secret organization was in existence, not alone in the Papal\r\nStates, but in Naples, in the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom, in the minor\r\nprincipalities of Parma, Piacenza, and Modena, and indeed throughout\r\nthe entire of Italy. Everywhere throughout Italy, too, in addition to\r\nthese secret associations, still subsisted a remnant of the old French\r\nor Franco-Italian party, who, while they submitted to the existing\r\nstate of things, and offered no resistance to the established regime,\r\nconcealing their discontent, and cautiously repressing their aspirations\r\nafter the cherished vision of a “united and independent Italy,” yet were\r\nnotoriously dissatisfied with the domestic governments, and lost no\r\nopportunity of embarrassing their administration. Of this, in the Papal\r\nStates, Bologna had long been the centre.\r\n\r\nThe Abate Mezzofanti had never taken any part in political affairs; but\r\nhis principles were well known, and his antecedents had long marked him\r\nout as an ardent and devoted adherent of the Papal rule. Personally\r\ninoffensive and amiable as he was, therefore, he was on these grounds,\r\ndistasteful to certain members of the anti-papal party. But by the great\r\nbody of his fellow-citizens he was regarded as a man of thoroughly\r\nhonourable principles; and we shall see that in a crisis of great\r\ndelicacy and importance he was selected as one of their delegates to the\r\ncourt of Gregory XVI.\r\n\r\nIt is to these political animosities that allusion is made in the\r\nfollowing extremely interesting account of Mezzofanti. It is from the pen\r\nof the distinguished historian of the mathematical sciences in Italy, M.\r\nLibri; whose name is in itself sufficient to stamp with authority any\r\nstatement bearing upon a subject in which he has proved himself a master.\r\n\r\nFor this most interesting communication I am indebted to the good offices\r\nof Mr. Watts, to whom it was addressed by M. Libri, in reply to an\r\ninquiry kindly made on my behalf by that gentleman. M. Libri’s letter\r\nis in English, and the purity of its language and elegance of its style\r\nare in themselves no slight evidence of his competence to pronounce\r\nupon Mezzofanti’s accomplishments as a linguist, no less than as a\r\nmathematician.\r\n\r\nM. Libri’s meeting with Mezzofanti occurred at Bologna early in 1830, in\r\nthe course of a literary tour in which M. Libri was then engaged.\r\n\r\n    “Among all these eminent men, the one that interested me\r\n    most was unquestionably the Abbé, (afterwards Cardinal)\r\n    Mezzofanti, who was then librarian at Bologna, and respecting\r\n    whose astonishing power in languages I had heard the most\r\n    extraordinary anecdotes. During a short excursion which I had\r\n    previously made to Bologna, I had already got a glimpse of\r\n    that celebrated man; but it was not until 1830 that I could\r\n    be said to have seen him. I was presented to him by one of\r\n    my friends, Count Bianchetti, and I was received by him with\r\n    great kindness. He made me promise to go and see him again,\r\n    and offered to show me the library. I accepted his offer\r\n    eagerly; but it was principally in the hope of having a long\r\n    conversation with him that I repaired to the library next day.\r\n\r\n    Before going farther, I ought to say that I approached him\r\n    with mixed feelings. Personally, I have always been disposed\r\n    to respect and admire every man who possesses an incontestible\r\n    superiority in any branch of human knowledge; and in this point\r\n    of view, M. Mezzofanti, whom every body acknowledges to be the\r\n    man who knew and could speak more languages than any other\r\n    living man, had certainly a right to boundless admiration on my\r\n    part. It was popularly reported at Bologna, that M. Mezzofanti,\r\n    then fifty years old, knew as many languages as he counted\r\n    years; and I had heard related in respect to him, by men in\r\n    whose veracity I have full confidence, so many extraordinary\r\n    histories, that he became in my eyes a sort of hero of legend\r\n    or romance; but a hero of flesh and blood, who realized or\r\n    even surpassed all the wonders attributed to Mithridates as a\r\n    linguist. On the other hand, the liberal party, who certainly\r\n    had no sympathies with the Abbé Mezzofanti, spread reports\r\n    against him, by no means flattering; among which the one\r\n    that had most frequently reached my ears, consisted in its\r\n    being ceaselessly repeated, that the celebrated librarian at\r\n    Bologna was a sort of parrot, endowed with the faculty of\r\n    articulating sounds which he had heard, that he was only a\r\n    miracle of memory, understanding having nothing to do with\r\n    it; and that, independently of this trick of getting words by\r\n    heart, this extraordinary man possessed no solid information,\r\n    and little philological erudition. Without blindly adopting\r\n    this bare assertion, I must acknowledge that the judgment\r\n    passed on Mezzofanti by persons of some consideration, had\r\n    made an impression upon my mind, far from being favourable to\r\n    him: but that impression was soon dissipated in the course of\r\n    the interview I had with him. Before leaving Florence, I had\r\n    just read and carefully studied the treatise on Indefinite\r\n    Algebra, composed several ages before by Brahmegupta, and\r\n    which, translated and enriched with an admirable introduction\r\n    by Colebroke, had been published in London, in 1817.[434]\r\n    Being still filled with admiration for the labours of the\r\n    ancient Hindoos on indeterminate analysis, I mentioned the book\r\n    casually to Mezzofanti, and merely to show him that even a man\r\n    almost exclusively devoted to the study of mathematics, might\r\n    take a lively interest in the labours of the Orientalists. I\r\n    had no intention of introducing a scientific conversation on\r\n    this subject with the celebrated librarian; and I must even\r\n    add, that I thought him quite incapable of engaging in one. How\r\n    great then was my surprise, when I saw him immediately seize\r\n    the opportunity, and speak to me during half an hour on the\r\n    astronomy and mathematics of the Indian races, in a way which\r\n    would have done honour to a man whose chief occupation had been\r\n    tracing the history of the sciences. Deeply astonished at so\r\n    specific a knowledge, which had taken me quite unexpectedly, I\r\n    eagerly sought explanation from him on points which had seemed\r\n    to me the most difficult in the history of India; such, for\r\n    instance, as the probable epoch when certain Indian astronomers\r\n    had lived, before the Mahometan conquest, and how far those\r\n    astronomers might have been able, directly or indirectly, to\r\n    borrow from the Greeks. On all those points Mezzofanti answered\r\n    on the spot, with great modesty, and as a man who knows how\r\n    to doubt; but proving to me at the same time, that those were\r\n    questions on which his mind had already paused, and which he\r\n    had approached with all the necessary accomplishment of the\r\n    accessory sciences. I cannot express how much that conversation\r\n    interested me; and I did not delay to testify to Mezzofanti\r\n    all the admiration which knowledge at once so varied and so\r\n    profound, had excited in me. No more was said of visiting\r\n    the library, or of seeing books. I had before me a most\r\n    extraordinary living book, and one well calculated to confound\r\n    the imagination. Encouraged by his courtesy and modesty, I\r\n    could not resist my desire of putting questions to him on the\r\n    mode which he had employed in making himself master of so many\r\n    languages. He positively assured me, but without entering\r\n    into any detail, that it was a thing less difficult than was\r\n    generally thought; that there is in all languages a limited\r\n    number of points to which it is necessary to pay particular\r\n    attention; and that, when one is once master of those points,\r\n    the remainder follows with great facility. He added, that,\r\n    when one has learned ten or a dozen languages essentially\r\n    different from one another, one may, with a little study and\r\n    attention, learn any number of them. I strenuously urged him\r\n    to publish his experience on the subject and on the result of\r\n    his labours; but I observed in him a great aversion to the\r\n    publication of his researches. He affirmed that the more we\r\n    study, the more do we understand how difficult it is to avoid\r\n    falling into errors; and, in speaking to me of several writings\r\n    which he had composed, he told me that they were only essays\r\n    which by no means deserved to see the light. In the midst of\r\n    the conversation, as I was still urging him, he rose and went\r\n    to look in a box for a manuscript with coloured designs, which\r\n    he showed me, and which had for its object the explanation of\r\n    the Mexican hieroglyphics. Having begged him to publish at\r\n    least that work, he told me that it was only an essay, still\r\n    imperfect, and that his intention was to recast it completely.\r\n\r\n    This excursion to America suggested to me the idea of putting a\r\n    new question to him. I had collected at Florence, particularly\r\n    with relation to bibliography, several translations of the\r\n    whole Bible, or certain portions of the sacred books, in\r\n    different foreign languages. Some of these translations were\r\n    into languages spoken by North American savages; and in\r\n    looking through them I had been struck with the measureless\r\n    length[435] of most of the words of these tongues. Since the\r\n    opportunity presented itself naturally, I asked M. Mezzofanti\r\n    what he thought of those words, and whether the men who spoke\r\n    languages apparently so calculated to put one out of breath,\r\n    did not seem to be endowed with peculiar organs. Immediately\r\n    taking down a book written in one of those languages, the\r\n    celebrated linguist showed me practically how, in his opinion,\r\n    the savages managed to pronounce these interminable words,\r\n    without too much trouble. For fear of making mistakes, I cannot\r\n    venture, after twenty-five years, to reproduce this explanation\r\n    from memory. According to my usual practice, I had written\r\n    out, on my return home, the conversation which I had just had\r\n    with the celebrated linguist, and if I still possessed that\r\n    part of my journal you would find there almost the exact words\r\n    of the Abbé Mezzofanti; but those papers having been taken\r\n    away from me by people who, under a pretext as ridiculous as\r\n    odious, despoiled me, after the revolution of 1848, of all that\r\n    I possessed at Paris, I must confine myself to mentioning the\r\n    fact of the explanation which was given to me, without being\r\n    able to tell you in what that explanation consisted.\r\n\r\n    After what I have just recounted to you, I could add nothing\r\n    to express to you the opinion which that long conversation\r\n    with M. Mezzofanti (which during the few days that I passed at\r\n    Bologna was followed by some other interviews much shorter, and\r\n    as it were fugitive,) left in my mind on the subject of the\r\n    erudition, as profound as it was various, of that universal\r\n    linguist. As, however, I express here an opinion which\r\n    certainly was not that of everybody, permit me to corroborate\r\n    that opinion by the testimony of Giordani, a man not only\r\n    celebrated in Italy for the admirable purity of his style, but\r\n    who also enjoyed deserved reputation as a profound Grecian, and\r\n    a consummate Latin scholar. The testimony of Giordani on the\r\n    subject of the Abbé Mezzofanti is the more remarkable, because,\r\n    besides Giordani’s having (as is generally known) a marked\r\n    antipathy for the ultra-catholic party to which Mezzofanti\r\n    was thought to belong, he and the Abbé had had some little\r\n    personal quarrels the remembrance of which was not effaced.\r\n    Notwithstanding this, I read in the letters of Giordani lately\r\n    published at Milan, that, in his opinion, Mezzofanti was quite\r\n    a superior man.”\r\n\r\nM. Libri[436] proceeds to cite several passages from Giordani’s letters,\r\nwhich, as I have already quoted them in their proper place, it is\r\nneedless to repeat here. Indeed no additional testimony could add weight\r\nto his own authority on any of the subjects to which he refers in this\r\nmost interesting letter.\r\n\r\nSoon after this interview, the quiet of Mezzofanti’s life was interrupted\r\nfor a time. The Revolution of Paris in July, 1830, and the events in\r\nBelgium and Poland by which it was rapidly followed, were not slow to\r\nprovoke a response in Italy. The long repressed hopes of the republican\r\nparty were thus suddenly realised, and the organization of the secret\r\nsocieties became at once more active and more extended. For a time the\r\nprudent and moderate policy adopted by Pius VIII. in reference to the\r\nevents in France, had the effect of defeating the measures of the Italian\r\nrevolutionists; but his death on the thirtieth of November in that year,\r\nappeared to afford a favourable opportunity for their attempt. During the\r\nconclave for the election of his successor, all the preparations were\r\nmade. The stroke was sudden and rapid. The very day after the election\r\nof Gregory XVI., but before the news had been transmitted from Rome, an\r\noutbreak took place at Modena. It was followed, on the next day, by a\r\nsimilar proceeding at Bologna,—by the calling out of a national guard,\r\nand the proclamation of a provisional government. The Papal delegate was\r\nexpelled from Bologna. The Duke of Modena fled to Mantua. Maria Louisa,\r\nDuchess of Parma, took refuge in France. And on the 26th of the same\r\nmonth, deputies from all the revolted states, by a joint instrument,\r\nproclaimed the United Republic of Italy!\r\n\r\nThis success, however, was as short-lived as it had been rapid. The duke\r\nof Modena was reinstated by the arms of Austria on the 9th of March.\r\nOrder was restored about the same date at Parma: and, before the end of\r\nthe month of March, all traces of the revolutionary movement had for the\r\ntime disappeared throughout the States of the Church.[437]\r\n\r\nIt has been customary for the cities and _communi_ of the Papal States on\r\nthe accession of each new Pontiff, to send a deputation of their most\r\nnotable citizens to offer their homage and present their congratulations\r\nat the foot of the throne. Many of the chief cities had already complied\r\nwith the established usage.[438] Bologna, restored to a calmer mind,\r\nnow hastened to follow the example. Three delegates were deputed for\r\nthe purpose—the Marchese Zambeccari, Count Lewis Isolani, and the abate\r\nMezzofanti. They arrived in Rome in the beginning of May,[439] and on\r\nthe 9th of the same month, were admitted to an audience of the Pope,\r\nwho received them with great kindness, and inquired anxiously into the\r\ncondition of Bologna, and the grievances which had given occasion to the\r\nrecent discontents.\r\n\r\nTo Mezzofanti in particular the Pope showed marked attention. It had\r\nbeen one of his requests to Cardinal Opizzoni, the archbishop, when\r\nreturning to Bologna on the suppression of the Revolution, that he\r\nshould send Professor Mezzofanti to visit him. He still remembered\r\nthe disinterestedness which the professor had shewn in their first\r\ncorrespondence; and the time had now come when it was in his power to\r\nmake some acknowledgment. A few days after Mezzofanti’s arrival he was\r\nnamed domestic prelate and proto-notary apostolic, and at his final\r\naudience before returning to Bologna, the pope renewed in person the\r\ninvitation to settle permanently in Rome, which had formerly been made\r\nto him by Cardinal Consalvi on the part of Pius VII. Mezzofanti was\r\nstill as happy in his humble position as he had been in 1815. He still\r\nretained his early love for his native city and for the friends among\r\nwhom he had now begun to grow old. But to persist farther would be\r\nungracious. He could no longer be insensible to a wish so flattering and\r\nso earnestly enforced. It was not, however, until, as the Pope himself\r\ndeclared, “after a long siege,” (_veramente un assedio_) that he finally\r\nacquiesced;—overpowered, as it would seem, by that genuine and unaffected\r\ncordiality which was the great characteristic of the good Pope Gregory\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\n“Holy Father,” was his singularly graceful acknowledgment of the kind\r\ninterest which the Pope had manifested in his regard, “people say that I\r\ncan speak a great many languages. In no one of them, nor in them all, can\r\nI find words to express how deeply I feel this mark of your Holiness’s\r\nregard.”\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that one of the very first visits which he\r\npaid in Rome, was to the Propaganda. On the morning after his arrival,\r\nthe feast, as it would seem, of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, he\r\nwent to the sacristy with the intention of saying mass; and having,\r\nwith his habitual retiringness, knelt down to say the usual preparatory\r\nprayers without making himself known, he remained for a considerable\r\ntime unobserved and therefore neglected. He was at length recognised by\r\nDr. Cullen, the present archbishop of Dublin, (at that time professor of\r\nScripture in the Propaganda,) who at once procured for the distinguished\r\nstranger the attention which he justly deserved in such an institution.\r\nIt is a pleasing illustration, at once of the retentiveness of his memory\r\nand of the simple kindliness of his disposition, that in an interview\r\nwith Dr. Cullen not very long before his death, he reminded him of this\r\ncircumstance, and renewed his thanks even for so trifling a service.\r\nAfter mass, he made his way, unattended, to one of the _camerate_, or\r\ncorridors. The first room which he chanced to meet was that of a Turkish\r\nstudent, named Hassun, now archbishop of the United Greek Church at\r\nConstantinople. He at once entered into conversation with Hassun in\r\nTurkish. This he speedily changed to Romaic with a youth named Musabini,\r\nwho is now the Catholic Greek bishop at Smyrna. From Greek he turned to\r\nEnglish, on the approach of Dr. O’Connor, an Irish student, now bishop\r\nof Pittsburgh in the United States. As the unwonted sounds began to\r\nattract attention, the students poured in, one by one, each in succession\r\nto find himself greeted in his native tongue; till at length, the bell\r\nbeing rung, the entire community assembled, and gave full scope to the\r\nwonderful quickness and variety of his accomplishment. Dr. O’Connor\r\ndescribes it as the most extraordinary scene he has ever witnessed; and\r\nhe adds a further very remarkable circumstance that, during the many\r\nnew visits which Mezzofanti paid to the Propaganda afterwards, he never\r\nonce forgot the language of any student with whom he had spoken on this\r\noccasion, nor once failed to address him in his native tongue.\r\n\r\nThe deputation returned to Bologna in the end of June. Mezzofanti\r\naccompanied it, but only for the purpose of making arrangements for his\r\npermanent change of residence.\r\n\r\nHe had accepted the commission with exceeding reluctance, and it is\r\npainful to have to record that on this, the only occasion on which he\r\nconsented to leave his habitual retirement, he was not suffered to escape\r\nhis share of the rude shocks and buffets which seem to be inseparable\r\nfrom public life.\r\n\r\nAll who were most familiar with Mezzofanti, to whatever party in\r\nItalian politics they belonged, have borne testimony to the sincerity\r\nof his convictions and the entire disinterestedness of his views—a\r\ndisinterestedness which had marked the entire tenor of his life, and had\r\nbeen attested by long and painful sacrifices. Nevertheless, on the return\r\nof the Bolognese deputation from Rome, he had the mortification to find\r\nhis conduct misrepresented and his motives maligned. The marked attention\r\nwhich he had experienced at the hands of the Pope, was made a crime.\r\nHis simple and long-tried loyalty—the spontaneous homage which a mind\r\nsuch as his renders almost by instinct—was denounced as the interested\r\nsubserviency of a courtier; and the favours which had been bestowed on\r\nhim in Rome, were represented as the price of his treason to Bologna.\r\n\r\nMezzofanti felt deeply these ungenerous and unfounded criticisms. His\r\nhealth was seriously affected by the chagrin which they occasioned; and\r\nthese memories of his last days in Bologna often clouded in after years\r\nthe happier reminiscences of his native city on which his mind delighted\r\nto dwell.\r\n\r\nOwing to the unsettled condition of Italy during this year, but few\r\nEnglishmen visited Bologna. Among these were Dr. Christopher Wordsworth,\r\nCanon of Westminster (who also saw Mezzofanti in the following year in\r\nRome,) and Mr. Milnes, of Frystone Hall, Yorkshire, father of the poet,\r\nMr. Richard Monckton Milnes. The latter was much amused by Mezzofanti’s\r\nproposing, when he heard he was a Yorkshire man, to speak Welsh with him,\r\n“_as Yorkshire lay so near Wales!_”\r\n\r\nIt would hardly be worth while to note this amusing blunder in English\r\ntopography, (a blunder more remarkable in Mezzofanti, as in all\r\ngeographical details he was ordinarily extremely accurate,) were it not\r\nthat it is another testimony on the disputed question of his acquaintance\r\nwith the Welsh language.\r\n\r\nHe left Bologna finally for Rome in October, 1831. The Pope afterwards\r\nused jokingly to say, that “the acquisition of Mezzofanti for Rome was\r\nthe only good that came of the Revolution of Bologna in 1831.” By the\r\nkind care of the Pope, he was provided with apartments in the Quirinal\r\nPalace, nearly opposite the Church of Saint Andrew—the same apartments at\r\nthe window of which the lamented Monsignor Palma was shot during the late\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n[1831-33.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is one of Rochefoucauld’s maxims, that “in order to establish a great\r\nreputation, it is not enough for one to possess great qualities, he must\r\nalso economize them.” If Mezzofanti had desired to act upon this prudent\r\nprinciple, he could not possibly have chosen a worse position than Rome.\r\n\r\nFrom the very moment of his arrival there, his gift of language was\r\ndaily, and almost hourly, exposed to an ordeal at once more varied and\r\nmore severe than it would have encountered in any other city in the\r\nworld. Without taking into account the many eminent linguists, native\r\nand foreign, for whom Rome has ever been celebrated; without reckoning\r\nthe varying periodical influx of sight-seers, from every country in\r\nEurope, who are attracted to that city by the unrivalled splendour\r\nof her sacred ceremonial, and the more constant, though less noisy,\r\nstream of pilgrims from the remotest lands, who are drawn by duty, by\r\ndevotion, or by ecclesiastical affairs, to the great centre of Catholic\r\nunity;—the permanent population of the Eternal City will be found to\r\ncomprise a variety of races and tongues, such as would be sought in\r\nvain in any other region of the earth. From a very early period, the\r\npious liberality, sometimes of the popes, sometimes of the natives\r\nof the various countries themselves, began to found colleges for the\r\neducation, under the very shadow of the chair of Peter, of at least a\r\nselect few among the clergy of each people; and, notwithstanding the\r\nconfiscations of later times, there are few among the more prominent\r\nnationalities which do not even still possess in Rome, either a special\r\nnational establishment, or, at least, a special foundation for national\r\npurposes in some of the many general establishments of the city. In\r\nlike manner, most of the great religious orders, both of the East and\r\nof the West, possess separate houses for each of the countries in which\r\nthey are established; and few, even of the most superficial visitors of\r\nRome, can have failed to observe, among the animated groups which throng\r\nthe Pincian Hill or the Strada Pia, at the approach of the Ave Maria,\r\nthe striking variety of picturesque costumes by which these national\r\norders are distinguished. Each, again, of the several rites in communion\r\nwith the Holy See—the Greek, the Syrian, the Coptic, the Armenian—has,\r\nfor the most part, an archbishop or bishop resident at Rome, to afford\r\ninformation or counsel on affairs connected with its national usages, and\r\nto take a part in all the solemn ceremonials, as a living witness of the\r\nuniversality of the Church.\r\n\r\nBut before all, and more than all, is the great Urban College—the college\r\nof the Propaganda—which unites in itself all the nationalities already\r\ndescribed, together with many others of which no type is found elsewhere\r\nin Europe. Every variety of language and dialect throughout the wide\r\nrange of western Christendom;—every eastern form of speech\r\n\r\n    From silken Samarcand to cedared Lebanon;\r\n\r\nmany of the half explored languages of the northern and southern\r\ncontinents of America; and more than one of the rude jargons of north\r\nand north-eastern Africa, may be found habitually domiciled within its\r\nwalls. In the year 1837, when Dr. Wap, a Dutch traveller, who has written\r\nwell and learnedly on Rome, visited the establishment, the hundred and\r\nfourteen students who appeared upon its register, comprised no less than\r\nforty-one distinct nationalities.[440]\r\n\r\nAmid the vast variety of speech with which he was thus brought habitually\r\ninto contact, Mezzofanti, even if he had desired to “economize” his\r\nreputed gifts, could not possibly have done so without provoking a\r\nsuspicion of their questionableness, or at least of their superficial\r\ncharacter. Nor, on the other hand, would he have ventured to expose\r\nthe undeniable reputation which he had already established, although\r\nupon a provincial theatre, to the ordeal which awaited him in the great\r\ncentre of languages, living or dead, had he not been supported by the\r\nconsciousness of the reality of his attainments, as well as attracted by\r\nthe very prospect of increased facilities for pursuing and extending the\r\nresearches which had been the business and the enjoyment of his life. At\r\nall events, we shall see that from the first moment of his establishment\r\nin Rome, so far from having “economized” his extraordinary faculty of\r\nlanguage, he was most assiduous, and in truth prodigal, in its exercise.\r\n\r\nImmediately on his arrival he was appointed canon of the church of Santa\r\nMaria Maggiore. This, however, was but an earnest of the intentions of\r\nthe Pope, who, from the first, destined him for the highest honours of\r\nthe Roman Church. It is clear, nevertheless, from his correspondence,\r\nthat his affections still clung to his beloved Bologna. On occasion of\r\nhis first new year in his new residence, he received many letters from\r\nhis old friends, conveying to him the ordinary new year’s greetings. From\r\nhis reply to one of these letters which was addressed to him by a friend,\r\nSignor Michele Ferrucci, professor of Eloquence in the university, we may\r\ngather how warm and cordial were the attachments which he had left behind.\r\n\r\n                                            _Rome, January 4, 1852._\r\n\r\n    “The new-year greetings which, for so many years, I used to\r\n    receive from you in person, were always most grateful to me,\r\n    because I knew them to be the genuine expression of your\r\n    affection for me. In like manner the kind wishes conveyed in\r\n    your letter are no less acceptable, since they show me that\r\n    separation has not diminished your regard. I shall always\r\n    retain a lively sense of it; and wherever I may be, it shall\r\n    be my endeavour to give proofs by my conduct that I am not\r\n    insensible to it. Let one of these be the assurance of my most\r\n    zealous exertions to secure for you the change of position\r\n    which you are seeking, from the chair of eloquence to that\r\n    of assistant professor of archæology. I think it advisable\r\n    that means should be taken to make known here the wishes\r\n    of the professor himself, the Canonico Schiassi; and it is\r\n    indispensable that the measure should not only originate with\r\n    his eminence the arch-chancellor, but should have his most\r\n    earnest support. So far as I am concerned, I shall leave\r\n    nothing undone that may tend to further your wishes.\r\n\r\n    I was deeply affected in reading your wife’s sonnets on the\r\n    death of her sister and her father. May God grant that, this\r\n    great affliction past, a heart so full of tenderness as hers,\r\n    may meet nothing in life but joy and consolation in the\r\n    continued prosperity of her dear family! Present my respects\r\n    to her, and make my compliments to my old associates in the\r\n    library. I never for a single day forget that happy spot, and I\r\n    seldom cease to speak of it.\r\n\r\n    If there be any matter in which I can be of use to you, I beg\r\n    of you not to spare me.”\r\n\r\nOne of Mezzofanti’s first impulses on his being established in Rome,\r\nwas to turn to account, as a means of extending his store of languages,\r\nthe manifold advantages of his new position. On a careful survey of\r\nthe rich and varied resources supplied by the foreign ecclesiastical\r\nestablishments of Rome, and especially by the great treasure-house of the\r\nPropaganda, he found that there was one language, and that a language to\r\nwhich he had long and anxiously looked forward—the Chinese—which was, as\r\nyet, entirely unrepresented; the native students destined for the mission\r\nof China, being at that time exclusively educated in the Chinese College\r\nat Naples. It happened most opportunely that at this time Monsignor de\r\nBossi, (afterwards administrator Apostolic of Nankin), was about to visit\r\nthat institution, and proposed to Mezzofanti to accompany him;—a proposal\r\nwhich, as filling up agreeably the interval of rest which he enjoyed\r\nbefore entering upon the routine of the duties which awaited him, he\r\ngladly accepted.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese College of Naples was founded in 1725, by the celebrated\r\nFather Matthew Ripa,[441] with the permission of the reigning Pope\r\nBenedict XIII, and was formally approved by a bull of Clement XIII,\r\nApril 5, 1732.[442] In the earlier and more favoured days of the Chinese\r\nmission, although it was chiefly supplied by European clergy, yet the\r\nmissionaries freely opened, not alone elementary schools, but seminaries\r\nfor the training of native catechists who assisted in the work of the\r\nmission, even within the precincts of the Imperial City. But the unhappy\r\ndivisions among the missionaries upon the well-known question, as to\r\nthe lawfulness of the so-called “Chinese ceremonies;” and the severe\r\nenactments which followed the final and decisive condemnation of these\r\nceremonies by Clement XI., not only cut off all hope of this domestic\r\nsupply of catechists, but effectually excluded all European missionaries\r\nfrom the Chinese Empire. The only hope, therefore, of sustaining the\r\nmission was to provide a supply of native clergy, who might pass\r\nunnoticed among the population, or who would at least possess one chance\r\nof security against detection, which the very appearance of a foreigner\r\nwould preclude. With this view, Father Ripa brought together at Pekin a\r\nsmall number of youths, whom he hoped to train up under a native master,\r\nengaged by him for the purpose. A short experience of this plan, however,\r\nconvinced him, not merely of its danger, but even of its absolute\r\nimpracticability; and he saw that the only hope of success for such an\r\ninstitution would be, not only to place the establishment beyond the\r\nreach of persecution from the Chinese authorities, but, (as the great\r\nPope Innocent III. had contemplated a college at Paris for native Greek\r\nyouths),[443] even to withdraw the candidates altogether for a time\r\nfrom the contagion of domestic influences and domestic associations.\r\nHimself a Neapolitan, (having been born at Eboli, in the kingdom of\r\nNaples,) Ripa’s thoughts naturally turned to his own country for the\r\nmeans of accomplishing his design; and, after numberless difficulties,\r\nhe succeeding in transferring to his native city, under the name of “the\r\nHoly Family of Jesus Christ,” the institution which he had projected at\r\nPekin. It consists of two branches, the college, and the congregation.\r\nThe latter is an association of priests and lay brothers, (not bound,\r\nhowever, by religious vows), very similar in its constitution to the\r\nOratory of St. Philip Neri. The object of their association is the care\r\nand direction of the College.\r\n\r\nThe College, on the other hand, is designed for the purpose of\r\neducating and preparing for the priesthood, or at least for the office\r\nof catechist, natives of China, Cochin China, Pegu, Tonquin, and\r\nthe Indian Peninsula. They are maintained free of all cost, and are\r\nconducted to Europe and back to their native country at the charge of the\r\ncongregation; merely binding themselves to devote their lives, either\r\nas priests or as catechists, to the duties of their native mission,\r\nunder the direction and jurisdiction of the sacred congregation of the\r\nPropaganda. Since the time of the withdrawal of the European missionaries\r\nfrom China, the mission has relied mainly upon this admirable\r\ninstitution; and even still its members continue to deserve well of the\r\nChurch. The priest, Francis Tien, whose cruel sufferings for the faith\r\nare detailed by Mgr. Rizzolati in a letter published in the Annals of\r\nthe Propagation of the Faith, July 1846, was a pupil of this college. So\r\nlikewise is the excellent and zealous priest, Thomas Pian, who recently\r\nvolunteered his services to the Propaganda as a missionary to the Chinese\r\nimmigrants in California.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Mezzofanti’s visit, March 23, 1832, the superior of the\r\ncollege of the Congregation was Father John Borgia, the last direct\r\nrepresentative of the noble family of that name. He received the great\r\nlinguist with the utmost cordiality; and during the entire time of\r\nhis sojourn, the students and superiors vied with each other in their\r\nattentions to their distinguished guest. From the moment of his arrival\r\nhe had thrown himself with all his characteristic energy into the study\r\nof the language; and notwithstanding its proverbial difficulty, and\r\nits even to him entirely novel character, he succeeded in an incredibly\r\nshort time in mastering all the essential principles of its rudimental\r\nstructure. Most unfortunately, however, before he had time to pursue\r\nhis advantage, his strength gave way under this excessive application,\r\nand he was seized with a violent fever,[444] by which his life was for\r\nsome time seriously endangered. The fever was attended by delirium,\r\nthe effect of which, according to several writers[445] who relate the\r\ncircumstance, was to confuse his recollection of the several languages\r\nwhich he had acquired, and to convert his speech into a laughable jumble\r\nof them all. This, however, although an amusing traveller’s story, is but\r\na traveller’s story after all. Mezzofanti himself told Cardinal Wiseman\r\nthat the effect of his illness was not merely to confuse, but to _suspend\r\nhis memory altogether_. He completely forgot all his languages. His mind\r\nappeared to return to its first uneducated condition of thought, and\r\nwhatever he chanced to express in the course of his delirium was spoken\r\nin simple Italian, as though he had never passed outside of its limits.\r\n\r\nHe was so debilitated by this illness, that immediately upon his\r\nconvalescence it became necessary for him to return to Rome without\r\nattempting to resume his Chinese studies. Most opportunely, however,\r\nfor his wishes, the authorities of the Propaganda some years afterwards\r\ntransferred to Rome, as we shall see, a certain number of these Chinese\r\nstudents, with the view of enabling them to complete with greater\r\nadvantage in the great missionary college the studies which they had\r\ncommenced in what might almost be called a domestic institution.\r\nWith their friendly assistance Mezzofanti completed what had been so\r\ninauspiciously interrupted by his illness.[446]\r\n\r\nThe fatigues of the homeward journey brought on a renewal of the fever;\r\nand for some weeks after his return to Rome, (from which he had been\r\nabsent about two months,) he suffered considerably from its effects.\r\nHappily, however, it left no permanent trace in his constitution, and\r\nthe autumn of 1832 found him engaged once more with all his usual energy\r\nin his favourite pursuit. The intention of the Pope in inviting him\r\nto Rome, had been to place him at the head of the Vatican Library, as\r\nsuccessor of the celebrated Monsignor Angelo Mai, then First Keeper of\r\nthat collection, who was about to be transferred to the Secretaryship\r\nof the Propaganda. The arrangements connected with this change of\r\noffices, however, were not yet completed, and Mezzofanti availed\r\nhimself industriously of this interval of comparative leisure which the\r\ndelay placed at his disposal. His position at Rome brought him into\r\ncontact with several languages of which he had never before met any\r\nliving representative; and many of those which he had hitherto had but\r\nrare and casual opportunities of speaking or hearing spoken were now\r\nplaced within his reach as languages of daily and habitual use. In the\r\nMaronite convent of Sant’ Antonio he had ancient and modern Syriac, with\r\nits various modifications, at his command. For Armenian, Persian, and\r\nTurkish, the two learned Mechitarist communities of San Giuseppe and\r\nSant’ Antonio supplied abundant and willing masters. One of these, the\r\neminent linguist Padre Aucher, whose English-Armenian Grammar Lord Byron\r\nmore than once commemorates as their joint production,[447] was himself\r\nmaster of no less than twelve languages. To the Ruthenian priests of S.\r\nMaria in Navicella, he could refer for more than one of the Sclavonic\r\nlanguages. The Greek college of St. Athanasius, owing to the late\r\ntroubles in Greece, was then untenanted, but there were several Greek\r\nstudents in the Propaganda, awaiting its re-opening, which took place\r\nin 1837. The celebrated Persian scholar, Sebastiani, had just recently\r\nreturned to Rome. Signor Drach, a learned Hebrew convert, was Librarian\r\nof the Propaganda; and a venerable Egyptian priest, Don Georgio Alabada,\r\nsupplied an opportunity of practice in the ancient Coptic, as well as in\r\nthe Arabic dialect of modern Egypt.\r\n\r\nIn the German College were to be found not only all the principal tongues\r\nof the Austrian Empire, German, Magyar, Czechish and Polish, but many\r\nof its more obscure languages—Romanic, Wallachian, Servian, and many\r\nminor varieties of German, Rhetian, (the dialect of the Graubünden, or\r\nGrisons) Dutch, Flemish, and Frisian. In reference to some of these\r\nlanguages, I have been able to avail myself of the recollections of more\r\nthan one student of this noble institution, as witness of Mezzofanti’s\r\nextraordinary proficiency.\r\n\r\nHe was on terms of the closest intimacy with the Abbé Lacroix, of the\r\nFrench church of St. Lewis, since known as the editor of the _Systema\r\nTheologicum_ of Leibnitz. The Rector of the English College, Dr. (now\r\nCardinal) Wiseman, even then a distinguished orientalist, and professor\r\nof oriental languages in the Roman university, and the Rector of the\r\nIrish College, the present Archbishop of Dublin, were his especial\r\nfriends. In both these establishments, he was a welcome and not\r\nunfrequent visitant.\r\n\r\nThe several embassies, also, afforded another, though of course less\r\nfamiliar school. He often met M. Bunsen, the Minister Resident of\r\nPrussia; he was frequently the guest of the Marquis de Lavradio, the\r\nPortuguese ambassador, and Don Manuel de Barras, whose letter attesting\r\nthe purity and perfection of Mezzofanti’s Castilian, is now before me,\r\nwas an attaché of the Spanish Embassy.\r\n\r\nThe Propaganda, however, itself a perfect microcosm of language, was\r\nhis principal, as well as his favourite school. For his simple and\r\nlively disposition, the society of the young had always possessed a\r\nspecial charm; and to his very latest hour of health, he continued to\r\nfind his favourite relaxation among the youths of this most interesting\r\ninstitution. In summer, he commonly spent an hour, in winter an hour\r\nand a half, in the Propaganda, partly in the library, partly among the\r\nstudents, among whom he held the place alternately of master and of\r\npupil;—and, what is still more curious, he occasionally appeared in both\r\ncapacities, first learning a language from the lips of a student, and\r\nthen in his turn instructing his teacher in the grammatical forms and\r\nconstitution of the very language he had taught him!\r\n\r\nIndependently, indeed, of study altogether, the Propaganda was for years\r\nhis favourite place of resort, and there was no place where his playful\r\nand ingenuous character was more pleasingly displayed. He mixed among the\r\npupils as one of themselves, with all the ease of an equal, and without\r\na shade of that laborious condescension which often makes the affability\r\nof superiors an actual penance to those whom they desire to render\r\nhappy. While the cheerfulness of his conversation was often tempered\r\nby grave advice or tender exhortation, it was commonly lively and even\r\nplayful, and frequently ran into an amusing exhibition which those who\r\nwitnessed never could forget. In the free and familiar intercourse\r\nwhich he encouraged and maintained, there sometimes arose sportive\r\ntrials of skill, in which the great amusement of his young friends\r\nconsisted in endeavouring to puzzle him by a confusion of languages,\r\nand to provoke him into answering in a language different from that in\r\nwhich he was addressed. The idea of these trials (which reminded one of\r\nthe old-fashioned game of “cross-question,”) appears to have originated\r\nin a good-humoured surprise, which the Pope Gregory XVI. played off on\r\nMezzofanti soon after his arrival in Rome. The linguist, however, was\r\nequal to the emergency. Like the good knight, Sir Tristram, he proved\r\n\r\n    “Most master of himself, and least encumbered,\r\n    When over-matched, entangled, and outnumbered.”\r\n\r\n“One day,” says M. Manavit, “Gregory XVI. provided an agreeable surprise\r\nfor the polyglot prelate, and a rare treat for himself, in an improvised\r\nconversation in various tongues—a regular linguistic tournament. Among\r\nthe mazy alleys of the Vatican gardens, behind one of the massive walls\r\nof verdure which form its peculiar glory, the Pope placed a certain\r\nnumber of the Propaganda students in ambuscade. When the time came for\r\nhis ordinary walk, he invited Mezzofanti to accompany him; and, as they\r\nwere proceeding gravely and solemnly, on a sudden, at a given signal,\r\nthese youths grouped themselves for a moment on their knees before his\r\nHoliness, and then, quickly rising, addressed themselves to Mezzofanti,\r\neach in his own tongue, with such an abundance of words and such a\r\nvolubility of tone, that, in the jargon of dialects, it was almost\r\nimpossible to hear, much less to understand them. But Mezzofanti did\r\nnot shrink from the conflict. With the promptness and address which were\r\npeculiar to him, he took them up singly, and replied to each in his own\r\nlanguage, with such spirit and elegance as to amaze them all.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to these increased opportunities of exercise, he also derived\r\nmuch assistance, in the more obscure and uncommon department of his\r\npeculiar studies, from the libraries of Rome, and especially from that\r\nof the Propaganda. The early elementary books, grammars, vocabularies,\r\ncatechisms, &c., prepared for the use of missionaries in the remote\r\nmissions, have for the most part been printed at the Propaganda press:\r\nand the library of that institution contains in manuscript similar\r\nelementary treatises in languages for the study of which no printed\r\nmaterials existed at that time. To all these, of course, the great\r\nlinguist enjoyed the freest access; and it can hardly be doubted\r\nthat, during the first year of his residence in Rome, he did more to\r\nenlarge his stock of words, and to perfect his facility and fluency in\r\nconversation, than perhaps in any previous year of his life.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon Mgr. Mai’s appointment to the Secretaryship of\r\nthe Propaganda, May 15th, 1833, Mezzofanti was installed as _Primo\r\nCustode_, First Keeper of the Vatican Library; and about the same time\r\nhe was appointed to a Canonry in St. Peter’s. In the midst of the warm\r\ncongratulations which he received from all sides, it was not without\r\nconsiderable distrust of his own powers, that he entered upon the office\r\nof Librarian, as the successor of a scholar so eminent as Angelo Mai.\r\n\r\n    “It is no ordinary distinction,” he wrote to his friend Cav.\r\n    Pezzana, “to be called to succeed Mgr. Mai in the care of the\r\n    Vatican Library,—a post which has derived new brilliancy from\r\n    the brilliant qualities of its latest occupant: nor can I\r\n    overcome my apprehension lest the honour which I may gain by my\r\n    first few hours of office may decline, when it comes to be seen\r\n    how great is the difference between this distinguished man and\r\n    his successor. This fear, I confess, is a drawback upon my joy\r\n    at this happy event; but at the same time, I trust it will also\r\n    stimulate me to make every effort that the lustre of a position\r\n    in itself so honourable, may not be tarnished in my person. I\r\n    have only to wish that your congratulation, coming as it does\r\n    from a kindly feeling, may be an earnest of the successful\r\n    exercise of the diligence I am determined to use in my new\r\n    career, which is all the more grateful and honourable to me, as\r\n    it furnishes more frequent occasions of corresponding with you.”\r\n\r\nThere is another of his letters of the same period, which to many perhaps\r\nwill appear trivial, but which points in a still more amiable light, not\r\nalone his unaffected piety and humility, but the homely simplicity of his\r\ndisposition, and the affection with which he cherished all the domestic\r\nrelations. It is addressed to his cousin, Antonia, who has already been\r\nmentioned in a former part of this Memoir, but who, for some years before\r\nMezzofanti’s leaving Bologna, had been afflicted with blindness. On the\r\noccasion of his appointment, this lady employed the pen of a common\r\nfriend, Signora Galli, of Bologna, to convey her congratulations to\r\nMezzofanti. It would seem, moreover, that she had intended on the same\r\noccasion to make him a present, which Mezzofanti, out of consideration\r\nfor her limited means, had thought it expedient to decline.\r\n\r\n                                      “_Bologna, December 14, 1833._\r\n\r\n    My most esteemed cousin,\r\n\r\n    Accept, in return for all your kind congratulations and good\r\n    wishes, my most sincere prayer that God may bestow upon you\r\n    all the choicest blessings of the approaching festival. There\r\n    is _one_ present which it is in your power to make me, and one\r\n    which is especially suitable to a person so entirely devoted\r\n    to God as you are: it is to offer up the holy communion for me\r\n    on one of the coming festivals. I, upon my part, will offer\r\n    the Holy Sacrifice for you on the feast of St. John; and\r\n    on the same day I will make a special memento of your good\r\n    parish priest, the abate Landrino, who once, upon the same\r\n    day, showed me a kindness which I shall never forget. Pray\r\n    remember me to him, and also to dear Signora Galli, in whom, as\r\n    your secretary, you have found an admirable exponent of your\r\n    affectionate sentiments, for which I am deeply grateful to\r\n    you both. My nephews unite in best wishes for your health and\r\n    happiness. Make the best report from me at home, and believe me\r\n    always, your most affectionate cousin,\r\n\r\n                                                 JOSEPH MEZZOFANTI.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n[1834.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be convenient to interrupt the narrative at this point,\r\nfor the purpose of bringing together a number of miscellaneous reports\r\nregarding certain languages of minor note ascribed to Mezzofanti, which,\r\nthrough the kindness of many friends, have come into my hands. I shall\r\nselect those languages especially, respecting his acquaintance with\r\nwhich some controversy has arisen. As my principal object in collecting\r\nthese reports has simply been to obtain a body of trustworthy materials,\r\nwhereupon to found an estimate of the real extent of the great linguist’s\r\nattainments, I shall not consider it necessary here to follow any exact\r\nphilological arrangement; but shall present the notices of the several\r\nlanguages, as nearly as possible in the order of the years to which they\r\nbelong, reserving for a later time the general summary of the results.\r\n\r\nI shall commence with a language to which some allusions have been made\r\nalready—the Welsh.\r\n\r\nMr. Watts, in his admirable paper so often cited, has recorded it, as the\r\nopinion of Mr. Thomas Ellis of the British Museum—“a Welsh gentleman,\r\nwho saw Mezzofanti more than once in his later years—that he was\r\nunable to keep up, or even understand, a conversation in the language\r\nof the Cymry.”[448] It is difficult to reconcile this statement with\r\nthe positive assertion of Mr. Harford, which we have seen in a former\r\npage;—that, even as early as 1817, he himself “heard Mezzofanti speak\r\nWelsh.” It might perhaps be suggested, as a solution of the difficulty,\r\nthat in the long interval between Mr. Harford’s visit, and that of Mr.\r\nEllis, Mezzofanti’s memory, tenacious as it was, had failed in this one\r\nparticular; but, about the period to which we have now arrived, there are\r\nother witnesses who are quite as explicit as Mr. Harford.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1834, Dr. Forster, an English gentleman who has resided\r\nmuch abroad, and who (although, from the circumstance of his books being\r\nprivately printed, little known to the English public) is the author of\r\nseveral curious and interesting works, visited Mezzofanti in the Vatican\r\nLibrary.\r\n\r\n    “To-day,” (May 14, 1834) he writes in a work entitled _Annales\r\n    d’un Physicien Voyageur_, “I visited Signor Mezzofanti,\r\n    celebrated for his knowledge of more than forty ancient and\r\n    modern languages. He is secretary of the Vatican—a small man\r\n    with an air of great intelligence, and with the organs of\r\n    language highly developed in his face. We talked a great deal\r\n    about philology, and he told me many interesting anecdotes of\r\n    his manner of learning different languages. As I was myself\r\n    acquainted with ten languages, I wished to test the ability of\r\n    this eminent linguist; and therefore proposed that we should\r\n    leave Italian for the moment, and amuse ourselves by speaking\r\n    different other languages. Having spoken in French, English,\r\n    Spanish, Portuguese, German, and Dutch, I said at last:—\r\n\r\n    ‘My friend, I have almost run out my stock of modern languages,\r\n    except some which you probably do not know.’\r\n\r\n    ‘Well,’ said he, ‘the dead languages, Latin and Greek, are\r\n    matters which every one learns, and which every educated man is\r\n    familiar with. We shall not mind them. But pray tell me what\r\n    others you speak.’\r\n\r\n    ‘I speak a little Welsh,’ I replied.\r\n\r\n    ‘Good,’ said he, ‘I also know Welsh.’ And he began to talk\r\n    to me at once, like a Welsh peasant. He knew also the other\r\n    varieties of Celtic, Gælic, Irish, and Bas-Breton.”[449]\r\n\r\nSome time after the visit of Mr. Harford, too, but before Mezzofanti\r\nhad left Bologna, when Dr. Baines, then Vicar Apostolic of the Western\r\nDistrict of England, (in which Wales was included,) was passing through\r\nthat city, the abate, concluding (erroneously, as Dr. Baines had the\r\nmortification to confess,) that the bishop of Wales must necessarily be\r\nan authority upon its language, came to him with a Welsh Bible, to ask\r\nhis assistance on some points connected with the pronunciation, being\r\nalready acquainted with the language itself.[450]\r\n\r\nAnother of his visitors, while at Bologna, has put on record a testimony\r\nto the same effect, which, although it does not expressly allude\r\nto Mezzofanti’s speaking the language, yet evidently supposes his\r\nacquaintance with it, and which moreover is interesting for its own sake.\r\nI allude to Dr. W. F. Edwards, of Paris, author of an able and curious\r\nessay addressed to the historian, Amedée Thierry, “On the Physiological\r\nCharacters of the Races of Man, in their Relation to History.” In this\r\nessay, while combating the popular notion, that in England the ancient\r\nBritish race has been completely displaced by the various northern\r\nconquerors who have overrun the country, Dr. Edwards alleges in support\r\nof his own work, which he heard expressed by Mezzofanti, and which,\r\nalthough founded on purely philological principles,[451] he regards as a\r\nsingular confirmation of his own physiological deductions.\r\n\r\n    “I owe,” he says, “to the celebrated Mezzofanti, whom I had\r\n    the pleasure of meeting at Bologna, an example of what I have\r\n    been urging; and I am glad to repeat it here for more reasons\r\n    than one. You will see in it a further confirmation of the\r\n    conclusion regarding the Britons of England, which I have\r\n    deduced from sources of a very different kind. If there is\r\n    any characteristic which distinguishes English from the other\r\n    modern languages of Europe, it is the extreme irregularity\r\n    of its pronunciation. In other languages, when you have once\r\n    mastered the fundamental sounds, you are enabled, by the aid of\r\n    certain general rules, to pronounce the words with a tolerable\r\n    approach to accuracy, even without understanding the meaning.\r\n    In English you can never pronounce until you have actually\r\n    learned the language. Mezzofanti, in speaking to me of Welsh,\r\n    traced to that language the origin of this peculiarity of the\r\n    English. I had no necessity to ask him through what channel. I\r\n    knew, as well as he, that the English could not have borrowed\r\n    from the Welsh; and that, before the Saxon invasion, the\r\n    Britons had spoken the same language which afterwards became\r\n    peculiar to Wales. Thus of his own accord and without my\r\n    seeking for it, he gave me a new proof, entirely independent of\r\n    the reasons which had already led me to the conviction that,\r\n    despite the Saxon conquest, the Britons had never ceased to\r\n    exist in England. They had for centuries been deemed extinct;\r\n    and yet he recognises their descendants, so to speak, by the\r\n    sound of their voice, as I have recognised them by their\r\n    features! What more is needed to establish the identity?”\r\n\r\nIn the marked conflict between these testimonies and the strong adverse\r\nopinion expressed by Mr. Ellis, “that the Cardinal was unable to keep\r\nup or even understand a conversation in the language of the Cymry,” nay\r\nthat “he could not even read an ordinary book with facility,” I have\r\nhad inquiries made through several Welsh friends, the result of which,\r\ncoupled with the authorities already cited, satisfies me that Mr. Ellis\r\nwas certainly mistaken in his judgment. The belief that Mezzofanti\r\nknew and spoke Welsh appears to be universal. Mr. Rhys Powel, a Welsh\r\ngentleman who was personally acquainted with him, often heard that he\r\nunderstood Welsh, and I have received a similar assurance from a Welsh\r\nclergyman of my acquaintance. Mr. Rhys Powel, mentions the name of the\r\nlate Mr. Williams of Aberpergwin, as having “actually conversed with\r\nthe Cardinal in Welsh,” during a visit to Rome some time before his\r\neminence’s death; and a short composition of his in that language, which\r\nI submitted to two eminent Welsh scholars, is pronounced by them not only\r\ncorrect, but idiomatic in its structure and phraseology.\r\n\r\nWith such a number of witnesses, entirely independent of each other,\r\nand spread over so long a period, attesting Mezzofanti’s knowledge of\r\nWelsh, I can hardly hesitate to conclude that Mr. Ellis’s impression to\r\nthe contrary must have arisen from some accidental misunderstanding,\r\nor perhaps from one of those casual failures from which even the most\r\nperfect are not altogether exempt. The concluding paragraph of Dr.\r\nEdward’s notice is interesting, although upon a different ground.\r\n\r\n    “It is to be regretted,” he adds, “that a man who surpasses all\r\n    others by his prodigious knowledge of languages, should content\r\n    himself with what is but an evidence of his own learning, and\r\n    should conceal from the world the science upon which that\r\n    learning is founded. It is not to his prodigious memory and\r\n    the, so to say, inborn aptitude of his mind for retaining words\r\n    and their combinations, that he owes the facility with which he\r\n    masters all languages, but to his eminently analytical mind,\r\n    which rapidly penetrates their genius and makes it its own. I\r\n    collect from himself that he studies languages, rather through\r\n    their spirit than through their letter. What do we know of the\r\n    spirit of languages? Almost nothing. But if Mezzofanti would\r\n    communicate to the world the fruit of his observations, we\r\n    should see a new science arise amongst us.”[452]\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that Flemish was one of the minor languages\r\nwhich he acquired during his residence at Bologna. From the time of\r\nhis settling at Rome, his opportunities of practice in this and the\r\nkindred dialect of Holland, were almost of daily occurrence. One of the\r\nearliest appears to have been afforded by his intercourse with a young\r\nstudent of the Germanic College, the abbé Malou, since one of the most\r\ndistinguished of the Catholic literatî of Belgium,[453] for several years\r\nProfessor of Scripture in the University of Louvain, and now Bishop of\r\nBruges. Monseigneur Malou has been good enough to note down for me his\r\nrecollections of his intercourse with Mezzofanti, in so far as they\r\nrelate to his native language.\r\n\r\n    “During my stay in Rome (1831-35), I conversed several times\r\n    in Flemish with Cardinal Mezzofanti, and I was thus enabled\r\n    to ascertain that he understood our language thoroughly. He\r\n    spoke to me of the works of Cats and Vondel, two distinguished\r\n    Flemish poets, which he had read. Nevertheless, I fancied that\r\n    I perceived his vocabulary to be rather limited. He often\r\n    repeated the same words and phrases. He spoke with a Brabant\r\n    accent, for he had learned Flemish from some young men of\r\n    Brussels, who studied at the University of Bologna, in which\r\n    his Eminence was at that time Librarian. Monsignor Mezzofanti,\r\n    after I had spoken, remarked of himself, that I, being a\r\n    Fleming, did not speak as they do in Brabant; and hence he\r\n    had a difficulty in catching some of my expressions, which he\r\n    requested me to repeat. It is, therefore, not quite correct to\r\n    say, that he knew our different dialects; but, if he had had\r\n    occasion to learn them, he could, without doubt, have done so\r\n    with great ease.\r\n\r\n    Some days before my departure from Rome, in May, 1835, I met\r\n    this learned dignitary in the sacristy of S. Peter’s. He at\r\n    once accosted me in Flemish; and, when I had replied, he\r\n    upbraided me with having forgotten my mother tongue, for I\r\n    mixed up with it, he said, some German words. The reproach\r\n    was well founded: for I had passed about three years in the\r\n    German College, where I had learned a little German, and had\r\n    had meanwhile no occasion to speak Flemish. Such a reproof from\r\n    an Italian, who thus gave lessons in Flemish to a Fleming,\r\n    struck me as exceeding droll, and amused me not a little. This\r\n    anecdote shows what minute attention the learned Cardinal paid\r\n    to the boundary lines of kindred tongues.\r\n\r\n    I have heard Mezzofanti, in the course of one evening, speaking\r\n    Italian, English, German, Flemish, Russian, French, and the\r\n    Sicilian and Neapolitan dialects of Italian.”[454]\r\n\r\nThis poverty of his Flemish vocabulary, however, disappeared with\r\npractice. Another learned Belgian ecclesiastic, Monsignor Aerts, who\r\nsubsequently to the sojourn of M. Malou in Rome, resided there for\r\nmany years, as Rector of the Belgian College, reports as follows of\r\nMezzofanti’s Flemish, such as he found it in 1837 and the following year.\r\n\r\n    “I was intimately acquainted with Cardinal Mezzofanti, during\r\n    my sojourn in Rome; that is to say, from 1837 to the moment of\r\n    his death. I saw him frequently. After the establishment in\r\n    Rome of the Belgian Ecclesiastical College, of which I was the\r\n    first President, and he the Patron, I had still more frequent\r\n    relations with his eminence. I spoke to him several times in\r\n    each month. Part of our conversation always took place in\r\n    Flemish. I can assure you that he never had to look for a word,\r\n    and that he spoke our language most freely, and with a purity\r\n    of expression and pronunciation not always to be met with among\r\n    our own countrymen. One day that I was admitted along with the\r\n    Cardinal, to an audience of the Pope Gregory XVI., during his\r\n    hour of recreation, His Holiness expressed a desire to hear\r\n    him speaking Flemish with me. We then began a little discussion\r\n    about the relative difficulty of German and Flemish. His\r\n    Eminence thought Flemish the harder of the two. The Pope called\r\n    him ‘a living Pentecost.’ He also wrote Flemish poetry: and\r\n    one day he gave me several verses of his own composition, to\r\n    send in token of remembrance to a young gentleman from Bruges\r\n    whom he had confirmed at Rome. Mezzofanti not only knew the\r\n    language itself thoroughly, but he was moreover acquainted with\r\n    its history and with the principal Flemish and Dutch authors.\r\n    I heard him speak of the works of Vondel, Cats, David, &c. He\r\n    spoke and pronounced Dutch equally well. He said, however,\r\n    that, the modern Hollanders had changed the language by\r\n    approximating to the German. He knew, also, some of the local\r\n    dialects of Flemish, especially that of Brussels. He could\r\n    even distinguish the inhabitants of Brussels by their accent,\r\n    of which I have more than once been witness. When he saw a\r\n    Fleming, he always saluted him in his own tongue; as he indeed\r\n    did with all foreigners.\r\n\r\n    In 1838, Cardinal Sterckx, Archbishop of Malines, paid a\r\n    visit to Rome, and I had the honour of being present during\r\n    several conversations which he held in Flemish with Cardinal\r\n    Mezzofanti. The latter once took a fancy to have a little\r\n    Flemish conversation with his colleague, in a consistory which\r\n    the Pope held at this time: and he himself playfully remarked\r\n    that probably that was the first time, since the origin of\r\n    the Church, that two cardinals had talked Flemish in a papal\r\n    consistory. Cardinal Sterckx told me this anecdote the same\r\n    day.”\r\n\r\nThe complete success with which he overcame the deficiency that M. Malou\r\nhad observed in 1831, and the curious mastery of the various dialects\r\nwhich his singularly exquisite perception of the minutest peculiarities\r\nof language enabled him to acquire, are attested by another witness of\r\nthe same period, Father Van Calven of the same city.\r\n\r\n    “On the 6th February, 1841,” he writes, “the Cardinal, who was\r\n    no less kind and affable than learned, administered the first\r\n    communion to my cousin, Leo van Oockerout, who was then with\r\n    his friends in Rome. Being a Belgian, a friend, and a relative,\r\n    I was invited to be present at the ceremony, which took place\r\n    in the Church of S. Peter, over the tomb of SS. Peter and\r\n    Paul. Cardinal Mezzofanti celebrated the Holy Sacrifice; and\r\n    after the Gospel, or perhaps immediately before the child’s\r\n    communion, he made a little discourse in French, in reference\r\n    to the beautiful occasion which had drawn us together. This\r\n    little discourse, which was very simple, was in excellent\r\n    French. After the ceremony was over, he called us all into\r\n    the sacristy, and there we had a conversation in Flemish. His\r\n    eminence distinguished the different dialects of our Belgian\r\n    provinces perfectly. Thus I remember distinctly that he said to\r\n    us: ‘I learned Flemish from a native of Brabant, and this is\r\n    the way I pronounce the word; but, you from Flanders, pronounce\r\n    it thus.’—I forget what was the word about which there was\r\n    question; but at any rate, the Cardinal was quite correct in\r\n    his observation.”\r\n\r\nThe same curiously delicate power of “discriminating the various dialects\r\nof the language, and of distinguishing by their accents, the inhabitants\r\nof the various provinces of Belgium,” are attested by another member\r\nof the same society, Father Legrelle. On the eve of this gentleman’s\r\nreturn to Belgium, he asked the Cardinal to be so good as to write his\r\nname in his _Album de Voyage_. On the very instant, and in F. Legrelle’s\r\npresence, his Eminence penned these Flemish verses, which he gave to M.\r\nLegrelle as a souvenir:—\r\n\r\n    God wept, en wyst den weg tot de volkomenheid;\r\n    Hoort zyne stem, myn Vriend, de stemme der waerheid.[455]\r\n\r\nOne of M. Legrelle’s companions, M. Leon Wilde, a native of Holland, and\r\nnow a member of the Jesuit Society at Katwick, bears the same testimony\r\nto the facility and elegance with which the Cardinal spoke Dutch. M.\r\nWilde also mentions his having written some verses in that language.\r\nBut a “Tour to Rome”[456] by a Dutch professor, Dr. Wap, published at\r\nBreda, in 1839, contains so full and so interesting a notice of the great\r\nlinguist, in reference to this department of his accomplishment, that,\r\nwithout referring further to M. Wilde’s letter, I shall content myself\r\nwith translating the most important passages of Dr. Wap’s account of his\r\nvisit. The author, then a professor in the military college of Breda, is\r\nnow resident at Utrecht.\r\n\r\n    “Joseph Mezzofanti,” he writes, “is at present[457] in his\r\n    sixty-fifth year. He is of a slight figure, pale complexion,\r\n    black hair which is beginning to turn gray, a piercing eye,\r\n    quick utterance, and an air full of good humour, but not very\r\n    intellectual, so that one would hardly expect to discover\r\n    faculties so extraordinary under such an exterior. The first\r\n    time I saw him was in the Vatican library, in the large hall\r\n    which is furnished with tables, for the accommodation of those\r\n    who wish to read or to take notes. He was busy distributing\r\n    books, and at the same time was talking to an English lady\r\n    accompanied by some English gentlemen. I afterwards spent an\r\n    hour or two with this family, and learned that Mezzofanti had\r\n    written in the lady’s album four very graceful English lines,\r\n    regarding America, whence she had come, and Vienna, where\r\n    she was going to reside. As soon as the librarian noticed\r\n    any foreigner, he at once began a conversation with him, and\r\n    carried it on, no matter what might be the stranger’s idiom.\r\n    Prince Michael of Russia was amazed at the ease and volubility\r\n    with which Mezzofanti spoke the Polish language. He accosted\r\n    me in English, which has in some measure become indigenous to\r\n    Rome: but, finding I was from Holland, he at once continued\r\n    the conversation in the _Brussels_ dialect (as he called it,)\r\n    and told me how scanty the means were of which he had been\r\n    able to avail himself in the study of Flemish. These were: a\r\n    Flemish grammar; two authors, (Bolhuis and Ten Kate,) with\r\n    whom he was acquainted; and finally, Vondel and Cats, whom\r\n    he had carefully read. He had never seen any of Bilderdyk’s\r\n    works, and he inquired whether this scholar had not introduced\r\n    a dialect into the Dutch language. When I had given him the\r\n    necessary information, and told him that Bilderdyk, besides\r\n    a hundred other works, had written a book on the characters\r\n    of the Alphabet, another on the Gender of Substantives, and\r\n    three volumes on their roots, his delight was extreme, and he\r\n    expressed a great desire to possess these works. I undertook\r\n    to send them to him, and I took care to redeem my promise,\r\n    as soon as I returned home.[458] After this interview, I did\r\n    not presume to manifest my earnest desire for any further\r\n    interviews with him: but Mezzofanti anticipated my wishes, and\r\n    invited me to come and see him at the Propaganda, as often as\r\n    I liked. There it is that he spends some hours, every evening,\r\n    among the students, talking with each in his own tongue. I took\r\n    advantage of his kind proposal, and had thus an opportunity of\r\n    getting a nearer view of this college of the Propaganda....\r\n\r\n    Nowhere will one find so many resources for amassing treasures\r\n    of knowledge united together, as in the vast college of the\r\n    Propaganda....\r\n\r\n    Here are assembled a hundred and fourteen students from\r\n    forty-one different countries. At my request, the Rector caused\r\n    the Pater Noster to be written by sixteen foreign students in\r\n    their respective languages. Here, in the evening, in the midst\r\n    of these various nations, I met Mezzofanti, who seemed to\r\n    belong to each of them. He spoke Chinese with Leang of Canton,\r\n    as easily as he spoke Dutch with Mr. Steenhof[459] of Utrecht.\r\n    I will never forget the instructive hours which I spent there.\r\n    The natural frankness of Mezzofanti, his free and communicative\r\n    conversation, his easy tone, his gay disposition, all rendered\r\n    my farewell visit, which I twice repeated, very painful to me.\r\n\r\n    Amidst so many grave employments, Mezzofanti goes twice each\r\n    week to the house of the orphans, to teach them the catechism,\r\n    and to the barracks of the Swiss soldiers to instruct them in\r\n    the principles of religion. The library requires his care twice\r\n    in the week, for several hours in the morning; in the afternoon\r\n    he gives lessons to the pupils of the Propaganda, whose studies\r\n    he superintends; to his care are confided the public discourses\r\n    delivered on the Epiphany: almost all foreigners come to visit\r\n    him; in fine, he pays his visits in his humble equipage, and\r\n    attends at the Pope’s court when pressing affairs requires his\r\n    presence; and, notwithstanding many duties and occupations, he\r\n    still finds time to assist at the divine offices. Who will not\r\n    feel profound respect and sincere admiration for such a man?\r\n\r\n    I will here subjoin some lines which I wrote _extempore_ in\r\n    Mezzofanti’s album, together with his immediate reply.\r\n\r\n    ‘Wie ooit de Pinkstergaaf in twijfel durfde trekken.\r\n      Sta hier beschaamd, verplet voor Mezzofanti’s geest,\r\n    Hij eere in hem den man, die de aard ten tolk kan strekken.\r\n      Wiens brien in ’t taalgeheim van alle volken leest.\r\n    Aanvaard, ô Telg van’t Zuid, den eerbiedgroet van’t Noorden,\r\n      Maar denk, terwijl nu oog mijn nietig schrift beziet,\r\n    Al mist der Batten spraak Italjes zang akkoorden,\r\n      Hun tongval of hun ziel leent zich tot vleijen niet.’\r\n\r\n    My veritable impromptu instantly called forth this beautiful\r\n    answer from Mezzofanti:—\r\n\r\n    ‘Mynheer! als uw fraaj schrift kwam heden voor mijne oogen,\r\n    Door Uw’ goedaardigheid was ikheel opgetogen,\r\n    En zooveel in mijn geest zooveel in’t hart opklom,\r\n    Dat mijne tong verbleef med vijftig taalen stom.\r\n    Nu, opdat ik niet schijn U een ondankbaar wezen,\r\n    Bid ik U in mijn hart alleen te willen lezen.[460]\r\n\r\n                                                  Joseph Mezzofanti.\r\n\r\n    _Rome, den 17 April, 1837._’\r\n\r\n    After writing these lines, he asked me if there were any\r\n    mistakes in them, and, if so, if I would be good enough to\r\n    point them out to him. I then noticed the word _fraaj_ in the\r\n    first line, knowing he would reply that the letter _i_ at\r\n    the end of a word should be replaced by a _j_. The _aa_ in\r\n    _taalen_, in the fourth line, he justified by a reference to\r\n    the Flemish grammar which he used at the time. As for the _d_\r\n    in the preposition _med_, which occurs in the same line, he\r\n    contended that this was the proper orthography of the word, as\r\n    it was an abbreviation of _mede_. I would have been greatly\r\n    surprised at all this, if I had not previously had occasion\r\n    to admire the delicate ear which this giant of linguistic\r\n    learning possessed for the subtleties of pronunciation, and the\r\n    wonderful perspicacity of his orthographical system: especially\r\n    as he had expressed to me his just disapprobation of the\r\n    foreign words which some of our countrymen are letting slip\r\n    into their conversation. He had already given proof to another\r\n    traveller from Holland that he was perfectly acquainted with\r\n    the difference between the words _nimmer_ and _nooit_, so that\r\n    he hardly ever used one for the other.”\r\n\r\nSide by side with the Dutch traveller’s sketch, may be placed a still\r\nmore lively account of Mezzofanti by another visitor of the Vatican,\r\nthe poet Frankl, a Bohemian by birth, but chiefly known by his German\r\nwritings. This sketch, besides the allusion to Mezzofanti’s skill\r\nin the poet’s native language, Bohemian, contains a slight, but not\r\nuninteresting specimen of Mezzofanti’s German vocabulary, and, moreover,\r\nillustrates very curiously the attention which he seems always to have\r\ngiven to the general principles of harmony, and his acquaintance with\r\nthe metrical capabilities of more than one ancient and modern language.\r\nThe Signor Luzatto, to whose introductory letter Frankl refers, was a\r\nfriend of Mezzofanti—a distinguished Italian Jew—himself an accomplished\r\nlinguist, and well known to oriental scholars by his contributions to the\r\n_Archives Israelites_, and by a work on the Babylonian Inscriptions.\r\n\r\n    “Having furnished myself,” writes Herr Frankl, “with a letter\r\n    of introduction from Luzatto of Padua, I went to the Vatican\r\n    Library, of which Mezzofanti was the head. His arrival was\r\n    looked for every moment; and I occupied the interval by\r\n    examining the long, well lighted gallery of antiquities which\r\n    is outside, and which also leads into the halls that contain\r\n    the masterpieces of ancient art in marble. I was in the act of\r\n    reading the inscription upon one of the many marble slabs which\r\n    are inserted in the wall, when a stranger who, except myself,\r\n    was the sole occupant of the gallery, said to me; ‘Here comes\r\n    Monsignor Mezzofanti!’\r\n\r\n    An undersized man, somewhat disposed towards corpulency, in a\r\n    violet cassock falling to the ancle, and a white surplice which\r\n    reached to the knee, came briskly, almost hurriedly, towards\r\n    us. He carried his four-cornered violet cap in his hand, and\r\n    thus I was better able to note his lively, though not striking\r\n    features, and his grey hair still mingled with black. About his\r\n    lips played a smile, which I afterwards observed to be their\r\n    habitual expression. He appeared to be not far from sixty. When\r\n    he came sufficiently near, I advanced to meet him with a silent\r\n    bow, and he at once received me with the greeting in German,\r\n    ‘_Seyn Sie mir willkommen!_’ (‘You are welcome.’)\r\n\r\n    ‘I am surprised, Monsignor,’ I replied, ‘that you address me\r\n    in German, although I have not spoken a word as yet.’ ‘Oh,’\r\n    said he, ‘a great many foreigners of all countries come to\r\n    visit me, and I have acquired a certain routine—pardon me, I\r\n    should have said a certain ‘knack,’ (die Routine—verzeihen\r\n    sie, ‘die gewandtheit’ sollte ich sagen,—) of discovering\r\n    their nationality from their physiognomy, or rather from their\r\n    features.’\r\n\r\n    ‘I am sorry, Monsignor,’ I replied, ‘that it is my ill fortune\r\n    to belie this knack of yours. I am a native of Bohemia,\r\n    although not of Bohemian race, and Bohemian is my mother\r\n    tongue.’\r\n\r\n    ‘To what nationality, then, do you belong?’ asked Mezzofanti in\r\n    Bohemian, without a moment’s hesitation.”\r\n\r\nHe afterwards changed the language to Hebrew.\r\n\r\nFrankl adds, that on a second visit to the reading room of the Vatican,\r\nhe found the gay animated Monsignor in the ordinary black dress of a\r\npriest; and took this opportunity to present him a copy of his “Colombo,”\r\nin which he had written the inscription, “_Dem Sprachen-chamæleon\r\nMezzofanti._” (“To Mezzofanti, the Chameleon of language”.)\r\n\r\n    “‘Ha,’ said Mezzofanti, with a smile, ‘I have had numberless\r\n    compliments paid me; but this is a spick and span new one,’\r\n    (funkelnagel-neu.)\r\n\r\n    Upon this word he laid a special emphasis, as if to call my\r\n    attention to his well known familiarity with unusual words.\r\n\r\n    ‘I see,’ he continued, ‘you have adopted the Italian form of\r\n    cantos and stanzas.’\r\n\r\n    ‘Yes,’ I replied, ‘the Germans nowadays, for the most part, do\r\n    homage to the Italian forms.’\r\n\r\n    ‘At last!’ said he, with a smile not unmixed with triumph.\r\n\r\n    ‘Schlegel, Bürger, and Platen,’ I said, ‘have written sonnets\r\n    quite as harmonious as Petrarch’s, and Tasso’s stanza has found\r\n    its rival among the Germans.’\r\n\r\n    ‘Well, at all events,’ replied Mezzofanti, ‘the Germans have\r\n    not succeeded in hexameters. Klopstock’s are incorrect and\r\n    inharmonious. What harmony is there in the line:—\r\n\r\n    ‘Sing, unsterbliche Seele, des sündigen Menschen Erlösung!’\r\n    Where is the cæsura—speaking to you, I should say,\r\n    _abschnitt_—in this line? Voss, it is true, wrote correctly;\r\n    and yet an Italian will hang down his chin whenever Voss’s\r\n    hexameters are read. As for Goethe, what sort of poetry is his?\r\n    You know his elegies—for example, the hexameter which ends\r\n\r\n    ——‘blaustrumpf und violet strumpf!’[461]\r\n\r\n    Surely he must have taken the Germans for a hard-hearted\r\n    nation!’\r\n\r\n    I quoted for him the burlesque couplet which was composed in\r\n    ridicule of Schiller’s and Goethe’s distichs.\r\n\r\n    ‘In Weimar und Jenam acht man Hexameter wie den,\r\n    Und die Pentameter sind noch erbärmlicher.’\r\n\r\n    He repeated it at once after me, and seemed to wish to impress\r\n    it on his mind.\r\n\r\n    ‘Do you know,’ he pursued, ‘what language I place before all\r\n    others, next to Greek and Italian, for constructive capability\r\n    and rhythmical harmoniousness?—The Hungarian. I know some\r\n    pieces of the later poets of Hungary, the melody of which\r\n    took me completely by surprise. Mark its future history, and\r\n    you will see in it a sudden outburst of poetic genius, which\r\n    will fully confirm my prediction. The Hungarians themselves\r\n    do not seem to be aware what a treasure they have in their\r\n    language.’[462]\r\n\r\n    ‘It would be in the highest degree interesting,’ said I,\r\n    ‘if you would draw up a comparative sketch of the metrical\r\n    capabilities of all the various languages that you speak. Who\r\n    is there that could speak on the subject with more authority?’\r\n\r\n    He received my suggestion with a smile, but made no reply.\r\n    He seems, indeed, to content himself with the glory of being\r\n    handed down to posterity as the Crœsus of languages, without\r\n    leaving to them the slightest permanent fruit of his immense\r\n    treasures of science.”[463]\r\n\r\nAmong these less commonly cultivated languages, I may also class Maltese.\r\nIn this Mezzofanti was equally at home. As Maltese can scarcely be said\r\nto possess anything like a literature,[464] it may be presumed that he\r\nacquired it chiefly by oral instruction, partly from occasional visitors\r\nto Rome, partly from some Maltese servants who were in the Propaganda\r\nat the time of his arrival. This much at least is certain, that, in the\r\nyear 1840, he spoke the language freely and familiarly. Father Andrew\r\nSchembri, of La Valetta, during a residence in Rome in that year, having\r\nconducted the preparatory spiritual exercises for a number of youths to\r\nwhom the Cardinal administered the first communion in the church of\r\nSan Vito, met his Eminence at breakfast in the convent attached to this\r\nchurch. No sooner was Father Schembri presented to him as a Maltese, than\r\nhe entered into conversation with him in his own language.[465] Another\r\nMaltese ecclesiastic, Canon Falzou of the cathedral, met the Cardinal in\r\nRome at a later date, in 1845-6. In the course of his sojourn he “had\r\nfrequent opportunities, for a period of eleven months, of conversing with\r\nhim in Maltese, which he spoke very well.”[466]\r\n\r\nI need scarcely observe that, although in the capital and the principal\r\ntowns of Malta, the prevailing language is Italian, the dialect spoken\r\nby the rural population contains a large admixture of foreign elements,\r\nchiefly Arabic and Greek. To what a degree the former language enters\r\ninto the composition of Maltese, may be inferred from the well-known\r\nliterary imposture of Vella, who attempted to pass off a forgery of his\r\nown as an Arabic history of Sicily under the Arabs.[467]\r\n\r\nBefore closing this chapter, I shall add a short note of the Count de\r\nLavradio, Portuguese ambassador in London, and brother of the Marquis de\r\nLavradio, who for many years held the same office in Rome. It regards\r\nMezzofanti’s acquaintance with Portuguese, another language which very\r\nfew foreigners take the trouble to acquire.\r\n\r\n    “I have always heard,” writes his excellency, “both from my\r\n    brother and from other learned Portuguese who knew Cardinal\r\n    Mezzofanti, that he was perfectly conversant with the\r\n    Portuguese language, and that he spoke it with facility and\r\n    with elegance. I myself have read letters written by him in\r\n    excellent Portuguese; particularly one very remarkable one,\r\n    addressed by him to the learned M. de Souza, for the purpose of\r\n    conveying his thanks for the offer which M. de Souza had made\r\n    to him, of a copy of the magnificent edition of Camoens, which\r\n    he had published in 1817.”\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Lavradio here referred to, while ambassador at Rome,\r\nexpressed the same opinion to Cardinal Wiseman. The Marquis, in\r\nMezzofanti’s Portuguese, was particularly struck by the precision of\r\nhis language and the completeness of his mastery over even the delicate\r\nforms of conversational phraseology. He instanced in particular one of\r\nhis letters. It was perfect, he said, not only in vocabulary but in form,\r\neven down to the minutest phrases of conventional compliment and formal\r\ncourtesy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n[1834-1836.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI resume the narrative.\r\n\r\nThe Librarian of the Vatican, or as he is more properly called the\r\n“Librarian of the Roman Church,” (_Bibliotecario della Chiesa Romana_,)\r\nis always a Cardinal, commonly the Cardinal Secretary of State. His\r\nduties as such, however, are in great measure nominal; and the details\r\nof the management practically rest with the _Primo Custode_, or chief\r\nkeeper of the Library, who is assisted by a second keeper, and seven\r\n_scrittori_, or secretaries, among whom are distributed the seven\r\ndepartments,—Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, Greek, Latin, Italian, and modern\r\nforeign languages—into which the books are classified.\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal Librarian at the time of Mezzofanti’s appointment was\r\nCardinal Della Somaglia, who had been Secretary of State under the Popes\r\nLeo XII. and Pius VIII.; and who, although, owing to his great age, he\r\nhad retired from the more active office of Secretary, still retained that\r\nof Librarian of the Vatican. Mezzofanti’s colleague as _Secondo Custode_,\r\nwas Monsignor Andrea Molza, an orientalist of high reputation, and\r\nProfessor of Hebrew in the Roman University.\r\n\r\nAttached to the Basilica of St. Peter’s, and subject to the chapter of\r\nthat church, is a college for the education of ecclesiastics, (popularly\r\ncalled _Pietrini_,) whose striking and picturesque costume seldom fails\r\nto attract the notice of strangers. The Rector of this college is always\r\na member of the chapter, and is elected by the canons themselves from\r\namong their number. Immediately upon his nomination by the Pope as member\r\nof the chapter, Mezzofanti was appointed by his brother canons to the\r\noffice of Rector of this college, which he continued to hold till his\r\nelevation to the Cardinalate. The office is in great part honorary;\r\nand Mezzofanti, in addition to his gratuitous services, devoted a\r\nconsiderable part of his income from other sources to the improvement\r\nof the establishment, and especially to the support of many meritorious\r\nstudents, whose limited means would have excluded them from its\r\nadvantages but for his disinterested generosity.\r\n\r\nHe was also named Consulter of the Sacred Congregation for the correction\r\nof oriental books, and a censor of the academy.\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be said that, from the moment of his arrival in Rome,\r\nhe had been received with warm and ready welcome in every scientific\r\nand literary circle. With Monsignor Mai, both during his residence at\r\nthe Vatican and after his removal to the Propaganda, he was on terms of\r\nmost friendly intercourse, and the confidant of many of his literary\r\nundertakings. The most distinguished professors of the several schools\r\nof Rome, Graziosi, Fornari, Modena, De Vico, Perrone, Palma, Manera, De\r\nLuca, vied with each other in doing him honour. He was elected into all\r\nthe leading literary societies and academies of the city; and soon after\r\nhis appointment as Vatican Librarian, he read in the “Academy of the\r\nCatholic Religion,” a paper which attracted much notice at the time: “On\r\nthe Services of the Church in promoting the Diffusion of True Knowledge,\r\nand the Development of the Human Mind.”\r\n\r\nThe Pope, Gregory XVI., himself, a great lover of oriental studies,\r\nreceived him into his most cordial intimacy. In the one brief hour of\r\nrecreation which this great and zealous pontiff, who retained even in the\r\nVatican the spirit and the observances of the cloister, allowed himself\r\nafter dinner, Mezzofanti was his frequent companion. The privilege of\r\nentrée was open to him at all times; but it was specially understood that\r\nat this more private and informal hour, when the Pope loved to see his\r\nmost cherished friends around him, Mezzofanti should present himself at\r\nleast once every week.\r\n\r\nIn like manner his early friend, Giustiniani, also an accomplished\r\noriental scholar, lost no time, on Mezzofanti’s coming to Rome, in\r\nresuming with him the intimate friendship which they had contracted\r\nduring his Eminence’s residence at Bologna, as Cardinal Legate.\r\nMezzofanti used to spend every Wednesday evening with Cardinal\r\nGiustiniani; and on one occasion, when Dr. Wiseman called at the\r\nCardinal’s, he found them reading Arabic together. He met with equal\r\nkindness from the Cardinal Secretary, Bernetti, and from Cardinal\r\nAlbani, who had both known him at Bologna. The venerable old Cardinal\r\nPacca, too, took especial delight in his company. He was a constant\r\nguest at the literary assemblies in the palace of Cardinal Zurla,\r\nknown to general readers as the historian of Marco Polo and the early\r\nVenetian travellers.[468] On Pentecost Sunday, 1834, the anniversary\r\nof the Feast of Tongues, the Cardinal gave a dinner in honour of the\r\ngreat Polyglot, at which many foreigners (one of whom was the present\r\nCardinal Wiseman) speaking a great variety of languages, and all the most\r\ndistinguished linguists of Rome, were present. Each of the guests carried\r\naway a feeling of wonder, almost as though his own language had been\r\nthe only subject of Mezzofanti’s extraordinary display. Signor Drach,\r\nthe learned Jew, named in a former page,[469] declared that he had not\r\nthought it possible for any but a born Hebrew to speak both Scriptural\r\nand Rabbinical Hebrew with the fluency and correctness which Mezzofanti\r\nwas able to command. A Polish priest named Ozarowski,[470] who sat next\r\nto Mezzofanti, assured the late Dr. Cox, of Southampton, that, had he\r\nnot known Mezzofanti personally, he would, from his conversation, have\r\nbelieved him to be a highly educated Pole; and he added that, “foreigner\r\nas this great linguist was, his familiarity with Polish literature\r\nand history completely threw his own into the shade.” Nor was this\r\nextraordinary faculty confined to the literature and language alone. A\r\nPolish lady was so astonished, not only at his knowledge of the language,\r\nbut at his “acquaintance with the country, and even with individuals,\r\n(for many of whom he inquired by name, describing where they lived, what\r\nwas their occupation, &c.,”) that, as she assured Cardinal Wiseman, she\r\n“could not believe that he had not resided, or at least travelled, in\r\nPoland.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe exact number of languages to which this extraordinary facility\r\nextended, had long been a matter of speculation. Mezzofanti\r\nhimself—averse to everything that bore the appearance of display—although\r\nrepeatedly questioned on the subject, generally evaded the inquiry, or\r\npassed it off with a jesting answer. It is probable too, that he was\r\ndeterred from any enumeration by the difficulty of distinguishing between\r\nlanguages properly so-called, and dialects. The first distinct statement\r\nof his own, bearing directly upon the point, which I have been able to\r\ntrace on good authority to himself, was made soon after his appointment\r\nas Vatican Librarian, in an interview with a gentleman of Italian family,\r\nlong resident in England, who was introduced to him by Dr. Cox, at that\r\ntime vice-rector of the English College. The particulars of the interview\r\nwere communicated to me by Dr. Cox himself, in a letter which I received\r\nfrom him a very short time before his death. The gentleman referred\r\nto was Count Mazzinghi, the well known composer, who, if not born in\r\nEngland, had resided in London for so long a time, that in language,\r\nhabits, and associations, he was a thorough Englishman.\r\n\r\n    “On one occasion,” says Dr. Cox, “when going to the Vatican\r\n    Library to visit Mezzofanti, I took with me an English family,\r\n    who were most desirous of being introduced to him. Mezzofanti\r\n    remonstrated good-humouredly with me for bringing people to see\r\n    him, as if he were worthy of being visited, but he received our\r\n    party with his habitual politeness.\r\n\r\n    The gentleman whom I introduced, begged as a favour that he\r\n    would tell him how many languages he could speak. ‘I have\r\n    heard many different accounts,’ he said, ‘but will you tell me\r\n    yourself?’\r\n\r\n    After some hesitation, Mezzofanti answered, ‘Well! if you must\r\n    know, I speak forty-five languages.’\r\n\r\n    ‘Forty-five!’ replied my friend. ‘How, sir, have you possibly\r\n    contrived to acquire so many?’\r\n\r\n    ‘I cannot explain it,’ said Mezzofanti. ‘Of course God has\r\n    given me this peculiar power: but if you wish to know how I\r\n    preserve these languages, I can only say, that, when once I\r\n    hear the meaning of a word in any language, I never forget it.’\r\n\r\n    He then begged us to excuse him, and called one of the\r\n    librarians to show us the principal curiosities of the library.\r\n    On our return, we found him seated with a young German artist,\r\n    who, he told us, was going to Constantinople. ‘I am teaching\r\n    him Turkish before he goes,’ he continued, ‘and as he speaks\r\n    modern Greek very well, I use that language as the means of my\r\n    instruction. I had the honour,’ he subjoined, ‘of giving some\r\n    lessons on modern Greek to your poet, Lord Byron, when he was\r\n    in Bologna.’\r\n\r\n    “I should add,” said Dr. Cox “that I frequently heard him\r\n    speak of Byron, and that his criticisms upon his works, and\r\n    his reflections on the peculiar characteristics of his poetry,\r\n    would have been worthy of a place in a Review.”\r\n\r\nWhile he thus professed, however, to speak forty-five languages, he took\r\ncare, as in his similar conversation with Dr. Tholuck, to convey that his\r\nknowledge of some of them was much less perfect than of others.\r\n\r\nNor did it remain stationary at this limit. Its progress, even while\r\nhe resided at Bologna, had been steady, and tolerably uniform. But the\r\nincreased facilities for the study which he enjoyed in Rome, enabled him\r\nto add more rapidly to his store. Cardinal Wiseman assures me, that,\r\nbefore he left Rome, Mezzofanti’s reply to the inquiry as to the number\r\nof his languages, was that which has since become a sort of proverb,\r\n“Fifty, and Bolognese.” Even as early as 1837, Mezzofanti himself, in his\r\nextempore reply to Dr. Wap’s Dutch verses, as we have seen, used words to\r\nthe same effect:—\r\n\r\n    Mijne tong verbleef med _vijftig taalen_ stom,\r\n\r\nI have been anxious to obtain, on this interesting point, an authentic\r\nreport from persons who enjoyed almost daily opportunities of intercourse\r\nwith Mezzofanti at this period, for the purpose of testing more\r\nsatisfactorily, the accuracy of a contemporary sketch of him, which\r\nappeared in a work of considerable pretensions, published in Germany,\r\nin 1837—Fleck’s “Scientific Tour,”—which describes him, from popular\r\nreport, as speaking “some thirty languages and dialects, but of course,\r\nnot all with equal readiness.” As M. Fleck is in many things, an echo\r\nof the supercilious criticisms of those who, while they admitted in\r\ngeneral terms the marvellous character of Mezzofanti’s talent, contrived,\r\nnevertheless, to depreciate it in detail, it may be well to afford the\r\nreader an opportunity of judging it for himself.[471]\r\n\r\n    “Of middle size and somewhat stooping in his gait,” writes M.\r\n    Fleck, “Mezzofanti’s appearance is nevertheless agreeable and\r\n    benevolent. Since he has been Prefect of the Vatican in Mai’s\r\n    stead, I have had occasion to see him daily. His talent is\r\n    that of a linguist, not that of a philologist. One forenoon in\r\n    the Vatican, he spoke modern Greek to a young man who came in,\r\n    Hebrew with a rabbi or ‘scrittore’ of the library, Russian with\r\n    a magnate who passed through to the manuscript rooms, Latin and\r\n    German with me, Danish with a young Danish archæologist who was\r\n    present, English with the English,—Italian with many. German he\r\n    speaks well, but almost too softly, like a Hamburgher; Latin\r\n    he does not speak particularly well, and his English is just\r\n    as middling. There is something about him that reminds me of a\r\n    parrot—he does not seem to abound in ideas; but his talent is\r\n    the more deserving of admiration, that the Italians have great\r\n    difficulties to cope with in learning a foreign language. He\r\n    will always remain a wonderful phenomenon, if not a miracle in\r\n    the dogmatic sense. It is said to have been observed, that he\r\n    often repeats the same ideas in conversation. He was entirely\r\n    dependant on Mai in his position in the Vatican, especially at\r\n    the commencement of his tenure of office, and manifested some\r\n    weakness in this respect. He told me he had learned Russian at\r\n    Bologna from a Pole, and so had been in danger of introducing\r\n    Polonicisms into his Russian. In the French wars, his visits\r\n    to the hospitals gave him an excellent opportunity of seeing\r\n    and conversing with men of different nations, and the march\r\n    of the Austrians made him acquainted with the dialect of the\r\n    gipsies. Thrice, he told me, he has been dangerously ill,\r\n    and in a kind of ‘confusion of languages.’ He is altogether\r\n    a man of a sensitive nervous system, and much more decidedly\r\n    and more pusillanimously attached to Catholicism than Mai.\r\n    He has never travelled, except to Rome and Naples; and to\r\n    Naples he went to study Chinese at the institute for the\r\n    education of natives of China as missionaries, and there he\r\n    fell dangerously ill. He seeks the society of foreigners\r\n    very eagerly, in order to converse with every one in his own\r\n    language. As a special favourite of the Pope, he enlivens\r\n    his holiness’s after-dinner hours (Verdaungs-stunden), and\r\n    is often invited to him in the afternoon: by his manifold\r\n    acquirements and the winning urbanity of his manners, he seems\r\n    as if born for the society of a court. He has made himself\r\n    popular among the learned foreigners who visit the Vatican,\r\n    by permitting them to continue their labours in the library\r\n    during certain days after the beginning of the holidays, on\r\n    which the library had ordinarily been closed with a view to\r\n    the adjustment and supervision of the MSS. His predilection\r\n    for acquiring foreign idioms is so strong that he observes and\r\n    imitates the provincial dialects and accents. He has carried\r\n    this so far, that, for example, he can distinguish the Hamburgh\r\n    and Hanoverian German very well. Even of Wendish he is not\r\n    ignorant. This is, indeed, a gift of no very high order; but\r\n    it is a gift nevertheless, and, when exercised in its more\r\n    dazzling points of practice, sets one in amazement. Mezzofanti\r\n    understands this well. The Italians admire this distinguished\r\n    and unassuming man, as the eighth wonder of the world, and\r\n    believe his reputation to be not only European, but Asiatic\r\n    and African also. He is said to speak some thirty languages\r\n    and dialects; but of course not all with equal readiness. The\r\n    Persian missionary, Sebastiani, who, in Napoleon’s time, played\r\n    an important political part in Persia, was eagerly sought after\r\n    by Mezzofanti when in Rome, that he might learn modern Persian\r\n    from him; Sebastiani, however, showed himself disinclined to\r\n    his society, which pained Mezzofanti much. Mezzofanti has been\r\n    called the modern Mithridates, and thought very highly of\r\n    altogether. In an intellectual point of view, many learned men,\r\n    even Italians, are certainly above him: his reading appears\r\n    at times shallow, owing to its having been so scattered, and\r\n    it has occurred that he has often repeated the same thing to\r\n    strangers; but his great and peculiar linguistic talent, which\r\n    seems as it were to spring from some innate sense, cannot be\r\n    denied; his good nature and politeness to the students who\r\n    frequent the Vatican are very great; and I am therefore unable\r\n    to comprehend how Blume (Iter Italicum, 1. 153,) can speak\r\n    of the opposite experience of learned travellers during his\r\n    residence at Bologna.\r\n\r\n    Mezzofanti is fond of perpetuating his memory in the albums of\r\n    his friends. He wrote in mine:—\r\n\r\n    Ἔρχεται ἀνθρώποις λαθραίως ἔσχατον ἦμαρ,\r\n    Oἱ δὲ περὶ ζωῆς πολλὰ μονοῦσι μάτην.\r\n    Χριστέ, σὺ μὲν πάντων ἀρχὴ, σù δὲ καί τέλος ἐσσί;\r\n    Ἔν τε σὸι ἐιρήνη ἐστὶ καὶ ἡσυχίη.”[472]\r\n\r\nI shall leave the greater part of these strictures, from their very\r\ngenerality, to be judged by the facts and statements actually recorded\r\nin these pages; merely observing that on all questions which involve the\r\ndepth and accuracy of Mezzofanti’s knowledge of particular subjects,\r\nthose only are entitled to speak with authority, who, like Bucheron,\r\nLibri, and others elsewhere referred to, took the trouble to test it by\r\nactual inquiry. It will be enough to say that, whenever M. Fleck has\r\nventured into details, his criticisms are palpably unjust.\r\n\r\nFor instance, even at Rome, with all its proverbial fastidiousness, the\r\nsingular beauty of Mezzofanti’s Latin conversation which Fleck describes\r\nas “not particularly good,” was freely and universally admitted; and\r\nBucheron, the Piedmontese professor who came to Bologna prepossessed with\r\nthe idea that Mezzofanti’s Latin scholarship was meagre and superficial,\r\nwas obliged to confess, after a long and searching conversation, that his\r\nacquaintance with the Latin language and literature was as exact as it\r\nwas comprehensive.\r\n\r\nIn like manner M. Fleck takes upon him to pronounce that Mezzofanti’s\r\nEnglish was “just as middling” as his Latin. Now I need hardly recall\r\nthe testimonies of Mr. Harford, Stewart Rose, Byron, Lady Morgan, Lady\r\nBlessington, and every other English traveller who conversed with him,\r\nas completely refuting this depreciatory estimate. The truth is, that\r\nmost of the English and Irish visitors with whom I have spoken, have\r\nagreed with me in considering that, in his manner of speaking English,\r\nthe absence of all foreign peculiarities was so complete as to render it\r\ndifficult, in a short conversation, to detect that he was a foreigner.\r\n“One day,” Cardinal Wiseman relates, “Mezzofanti then a prelate, visited\r\nme, and shortly after an Irish gentleman called who had arrived that\r\nmoment in Rome. I was called out, and left them together for some time.\r\nOn my returning, Mezzofanti took leave. I asked the other who he thought\r\nthat gentleman was. He replied, looking surprised at the question, ‘_An\r\nEnglish Priest_, I suppose.’”\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, about the same period, the late Dr. Baines, Vicar\r\nApostolic of the Western district, having been present at one of the\r\npolyglot exhibitions in the Propaganda, and having there witnessed the\r\nextraordinary versatility of Mezzofanti’s powers, returned with him after\r\nthe exhibition. “We dined together,” said Dr. Baines, “and I entreated\r\nhim, having been in the tower of Babel all the morning, to let us stick\r\nto English for the rest of the day. Accordingly, we did stick to English,\r\nwhich he spoke as fluently as we do, and with the same accuracy, not\r\nonly of grammar but of idiom. His only trip was in saying, ‘That was\r\nbefore the time when I remember,’ instead of ‘before my time.’ Once,\r\ntoo, I thought him mistaken in the pronunciation of a word. But when\r\nI returned to England, I found that my way was either provincial or\r\nold-fashioned, and that I was wrong and he was right.”[473]\r\n\r\nNor was this fluency in speaking English confined to the ordinary topics\r\nof conversation, or to the more common-place words of the language. His\r\nvocabulary was as extensive and as various as it was select. A curious\r\nexample of this, not only as regards English but also in reference to\r\nGerman, was told to me by Cardinal Wiseman.\r\n\r\nOne broiling day he and Mr. Monckton Milnes were walking in company with\r\nMezzofanti across the scorching pavement of the Piazza SS. Apostoli. They\r\nwere speaking German at the time.\r\n\r\n“Well!” said Mr. Milnes, utterly overcome by the heat and glare, “this\r\nis what you may call a—what is the German,” he added, turning to Dr.\r\nWiseman, “for ‘_sweltering_?’”\r\n\r\n“‘_Schwülig_,’ of course,” suggested Mezzofanti, without a moment’s pause!\r\n\r\nI have heard several similar anecdotes illustrating the minuteness of\r\nhis acquaintance with other languages; and when it is remembered, that\r\nhis stock of words was in great measure drawn from books, and those\r\ngenerally the classics of their respective languages, it need hardly\r\nbe considered matter of surprise, that, as, in English, Lady Morgan\r\nfound “his turn of phrase and peculiar selection of words to be those\r\nof the “Spectator,” so other foreigners have been struck by finding an\r\nItalian model his conversational style upon the highest and most refined\r\nstandards in their respective literatures. One instance may suffice as\r\na specimen. Professor Carlson of the university of Upsala, who was for\r\na considerable time engaged in the Vatican Library, in examining the\r\npapers of Queen Christina, and was thus thrown for weeks into constant\r\ncommunication with Mezzofanti, assured my friend Mr. Wackerbarth of the\r\nsame university, that Mezzofanti spoke the language perfectly—“quite\r\nlike a native;” and that not only as regards the words, but also as\r\nregards the accent and rhythm of the language, which is very difficult.\r\nThe Swedish and Danish languages are very much alike, though differing\r\nwidely in accent and musical character. The Professor declared, that\r\nMezzofanti was perfectly at home in both, as well as regards their\r\naffinities as their differences. He added, that if there were any fault\r\nto find with Mezzofanti’s speaking of Swedish, it was _perhaps a trifle\r\ntoo grammatically accurate_: if that can be considered as a fault. This\r\nmay perhaps be better understood when explained, that in Swedish the\r\ndifference between the spoken and written language, is perhaps more\r\nthan in most languages, many words being inflected in the written,\r\nbut not in the spoken language. Thus the verb “kan,” (can,) is in the\r\nplural, “kunna;” but in conversation the plural is “kan,” the same\r\nas the singular. Now, from the anecdote already told regarding young\r\nUttini,[474] it appears that Mezzofanti was almost entirely self-taught\r\nin Swedish; and I infer from the catalogue of his library that his course\r\nof Swedish reading lay exclusively among the purest classics of that\r\nlanguage. I am informed by Mr. Wackerbarth, that Count Oxenstjerna, son\r\nof the classical Swedish translator of Milton and Dante, who conversed\r\nwith him at Rome, found him thoroughly familiar with his father’s\r\nworks,[475] and in general critically acquainted with all the masters of\r\nSwedish style.\r\n\r\nIndeed there is hardly any circumstance connected with this extraordinary\r\ngift more calculated to excite wonder than the extent and accuracy of his\r\nacquaintance with the various literatures of the languages to which he\r\nhad applied himself. The fact is attested by so many witnesses that it is\r\nimpossible to doubt it. Numerous instances have been already cited; but\r\nI cannot pass from this period of his life without adding a few others,\r\nchiefly regarding oriental languages, taken almost at random from many\r\nindependent testimonies which have been communicated to me by persons who\r\nenjoyed his intimacy during the early years of his residence at Rome.\r\n\r\nIn a commission for the revision of the liturgical books of the Armenian\r\nrite appointed by Pope Gregory XVI., he was associated with a native\r\nArmenian scholar, Father Arsenius Angiarakian, Abbot of the Monastery of\r\nSt. Gregory the Illuminator. This learned ecclesiastic, in a letter dated\r\nAugust 15, 1855, assures me that during the frequent opportunities of\r\nobservation which a literary inquiry of such exceeding delicacy afforded,\r\nhe was astonished (_ho dovuto stupire_) at the profound knowledge of\r\nthe ancient language of Armenia, exhibited by his associate. He adds\r\nthat Mezzofanti “spoke the vulgar Armenian with perfect freedom, and in\r\nall its dialects.” Mgr. Hurmuz, the Armenian Archbishop of Sirace, in a\r\nletter of May 24th, in the same year, attests that Mezzofanti’s Armenian\r\nscholarship “was not confined to the knowledge of the language, ancient\r\nand modern; he also knew the history of the Armenian nation, and of\r\nscience and art among them, together with their periods of progress and\r\ndecay.”\r\n\r\nFather Arsenius frequently introduced oriental visitors, especially Turks\r\nand Persians, to Mezzofanti. Ahmed Fethi Pasha, with his Secretary,\r\nSami Effendi, was presented to him on his way to London in 1836. After\r\na long interview he declared to Father Arsenius, that “Mezzofanti was\r\nnot only perfectly at home in the vocabulary, the structure, and the\r\npronunciation, both of Turkish and of Persian, but thoroughly and\r\nprofoundly versed (_possedeva per eccellenza_) in both literatures—being\r\nmaster of the great classic prose writers and poets of both, and their\r\nliterary history.” He received the same assurances as to both languages,\r\nat various times, from Redschid Pasha, Ali Pasha, Fuad Effendi, and\r\nShekib Effendi.\r\n\r\nA native Syrian whom M. Antoine d’Abbadie met in Rome in 1839, assured\r\nhim that “Mezzofanti’s knowledge of Arabic and fluency in speaking it\r\nwere both equally admirable.”[476]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the literature of Greece, Monsignor Missir, the learned Greek\r\nArchbishop of Irenopolis who has for many years resided at Rome, declares\r\n(in a letter of May 21st, 1855,) his belief that “Mezzofanti was as fully\r\nmaster of the ancient Greek, as he was of Latin or Italian, and that\r\nthere was scarce a Greek author, ancient or modern, sacred or profane,\r\nwhom he had not read.” The abate Pietro Matranga,[477] a Greek of Sicily,\r\nand professor of Greek in the Greek College of St. Athanasius, confirms\r\nthis impression to a great extent. He states (August 17th, 1855) that “in\r\nexamining the students of the Greek College, (as was his custom for many\r\nyears) in the classical authors, both the orators and the tragedians,\r\nMezzofanti never had occasion to take a book into his hands; being able\r\non the passage being indicated by the professor, to repeat it from\r\nmemory.”\r\n\r\nA Polish priest named Ozarowski, stated as much for Polish literature to\r\nDr. Cox.\r\n\r\nNay, even in such an out-of-the-way literature as that of Sicily,\r\nthe same abate Matranga assures me that he was equally versed. “He\r\ndelighted,” says the abate, “in repeating from memory the poetry of the\r\nSicilian poet, Giovanni Meli,”[478] a writer who although of the highest\r\nfame among his countrymen, is hardly known even by name outside of his\r\nnative island.\r\n\r\nI cannot close, however, without saying that I have not found any\r\nevidence of his having being equally familiar with another exceedingly\r\nimportant literature of the East—the ancient Syriac. Vague statements\r\nI have heard in abundance; but no one to whom I have had access could\r\nspeak with certainty; and Signor Matteo Schiahuan, professor of that\r\nlanguage in the Propaganda, considered him but moderately versed therein,\r\n(_una mediocre cognizione_.) This will appear the more difficult of\r\nexplanation, as the Syriac department of his catalogue is tolerably\r\nextensive, and is abundantly supplied with at least the elementary books\r\nof that language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n[1836-1838.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOne evening about this time, Dr. Wiseman, meeting Mezzofanti in the\r\nPiazza di Spagna, inquired where he was going.\r\n\r\n“To the Propaganda,” he replied; “I have to give a lesson there.”\r\n\r\n“In what language?” asked Dr. Wiseman.\r\n\r\n“In Californian,” said Mezzofanti. “I am teaching it to the Californian\r\nyouths whom we have there.”\r\n\r\n“Californian!” exclaimed his friend, “From whom can you possibly have\r\nlearned that out-of-the-way tongue?”\r\n\r\n“_From themselves_,” replied Mezzofanti: “and now I am teaching it to\r\nthem grammatically.”\r\n\r\nThis interesting anecdote illustrates another curious phase of\r\nMezzofanti’s marvellous faculty—the manner in which he dealt with\r\na language, not only new to himself, but entirely unwritten,\r\nunsystematized, and, in a word, destitute of all the ordinary aids and\r\nappliances of study.\r\n\r\nTwo native Californians, children of one of the many Indian tribes of\r\nthat peninsula, were sent to Rome to be educated at the Propaganda. One\r\nof these died not very long after his arrival; the other, whose native\r\nname was Tac, and who exhibited much more talent than his companion,\r\nlived in the Propaganda for about three years, but eventually sunk under\r\nthe effects of the Roman climate, and perhaps, of the confinement and\r\nunwonted habits of collegiate life. To these youths, from the day of\r\ntheir arrival, Mezzofanti attached himself with all the interest which a\r\nnew language always possessed for him.[479]\r\n\r\nThe Indians of the Californian peninsula are broken up into several\r\nindependent tribes, the principal of which are three in number, the\r\nPicos, the Waicuros, and the Laymones. Their languages are as various\r\nas their subdivisions of race. In the days of the Spanish missionaries,\r\nthere could hardly be found any two or three missions in which the same\r\ndialect was spoken;[480] insomuch that the fathers of these missions have\r\nnever succeeded in doing for the native language, what they have done for\r\nmost of the other languages of Northern and Central America—reducing it\r\nto an intelligible grammatical system.[481] Upon Mezzofanti, therefore,\r\nin his intercourse with these youths, devolved all the trouble of\r\ndiscovering the grammatical structure of the Californian language, and\r\nof reducing it to rules. It was a most curious process. He began by\r\nmaking his pupils recite the Lord’s Prayer, until he picked up first the\r\ngeneral meaning, and afterwards the particular sounds, and what may be\r\ncalled the rhythm of the language. The next step was to ascertain and to\r\nclassify the particles, both affixes and suffixes; to distinguish verbs\r\nfrom nouns, and substantives from adjectives; to discover the principal\r\ninflexions of both. Having once mastered the preliminaries, his power\r\nof generalising seemed rather to be an instinct than an exercise of the\r\nreasoning faculty. With him the knowledge of words led, almost without an\r\neffort, to the power of speaking.\r\n\r\nI have been assured by the Rev. James Doyle, who was a student of\r\nthe Propaganda at the time, and who had frequent opportunities of\r\nwitnessing Mezzofanti’s conversation with these youths, that his\r\nsuccess was complete, at least so far as could be judged from external\r\nappearance—from his fluency, his facility of speech, and all the other\r\noutward indications of familiarity.[482] Some time before the arrival of\r\nthese Californians, and soon after Mezzofanti’s coming to Rome, Bishop\r\nFenwick, of Cincinnati, had sent for education to the Propaganda two\r\nNorth American Indians, youths of the Ottawa tribe, then residing near\r\nMackinaw, at the upper end of Lake Michegan. The elder of these, named\r\nAugustine Hamelin, was a half-breed, being the son of a French father;\r\nthe younger, whose Indian name was _Maccodobenesi_, (“the Blackbird,”)\r\nwas of pure Ottawa blood.[483] Unhappily, as almost invariably happens\r\nin similar circumstances, the Indian, although a youth of much promise\r\nand very remarkable piety, pined away in the College, and eventually\r\ndied from the bursting of a blood-vessel. Augustin Hamelin, the elder,\r\nspent a considerable time in the Propaganda, where he studied with\r\ngreat success, but in the end, being seized with blood-spitting, the\r\nauthorities of the College, apprehensive of a recurrence of the same\r\ndisease which had befallen Maccodobenesi, judged it more prudent to\r\nsend him back to America. In consequence, he rejoined his tribe in the\r\nyear 1835, or 1836. Mrs. Jameson, who in her “Rambles among the Red\r\nMen,” speaks of the Roman Catholic Ottawa converts in general, as “in\r\nappearance, dress, intelligence, industry, and general civilization,\r\nsuperior to the converts of all other communions,” refers in particular\r\nto “a well-looking young man, dressed in European fashion and in black,\r\nof mixed blood, French and Indian, who had been sent, when young, to be\r\neducated at the Propaganda, and was lately come to settle as a teacher\r\nand interpreter among his people.”[484] This youth, there can be no\r\ndoubt, was Hamelin. Having come soon afterwards to Washington, as one\r\nof a deputation from his tribe to negociate a treaty with the United\r\nStates Government, he produced a great sensation by his high education,\r\nhis great general knowledge, and especially his skill in languages; and\r\non a subsequent occasion, in 1840, Bishop O’Connor, of Pittsburgh, who\r\nhad known him in the Propaganda, and to whom I am indebted for these\r\nparticulars regarding him, encountered him in Philadelphia, engaged in a\r\nsimilar mission to the American Government.\r\n\r\nThe well-known Indian philologer, M. du Ponceau, met him about the same\r\ntime, and speaks with much praise of his intelligence and ability. It\r\nwas from Hamelin that M. du Ponceau obtained the information regarding\r\nthe Ottawa language which he has used in the comparative vocabulary of\r\nIndian languages, appended to his _Memoire sur le Systeme Grammaticale\r\ndes Langues Indiennes_.[485]\r\n\r\nWhether Mezzofanti learned the Ottawa dialect from these youths I have\r\nnot positively ascertained. Indeed it is difficult to say at what precise\r\ntime he first directed his attention to the Indian languages of North\r\nAmerica. He certainly knew something of them before he left Bologna.\r\nHe read for M. Libri, in 1830, a book in one of the Indian languages.\r\nPrince Lewis Lucian Bonaparte too, in a communication with which he\r\nhas honoured me, mentions a conversation with him at Bologna, in which\r\nhe spoke of these Indian languages, and alluded to one in particular in\r\nwhich the letter _B_ is wanting; “not,” as he explained to the Prince,\r\n“on account of any peculiarity in the genius of the language which\r\nexcludes this sound, but because the Indians of this tribe wear a heavy\r\nornament suspended by a ring from the under lip, which by dragging the\r\nunder lip downwards, and thus preventing its contact with the upper,\r\nrenders it impossible for them to produce the sound of _B_ or any other\r\nlabial.” It is probable therefore, that even before he first met Hamelin\r\nand his companion, Mezzofanti had already learnt something of these\r\nIndian languages; and as, in his conversation with Dr. Kip, some years\r\nlater, the only languages which he mentioned as known to him are the\r\nChippewa, the Delaware, and the Algonquin, it is most likely that it\r\nwas the first of these—a variety of which is spoken by the Ottawas—that\r\nformed his medium of conversation with these youths. On this point, Dr.\r\nO’Connor is unable to speak from his own knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe Indian language which he knew best, however, was the Algonquin, the\r\nparent of a large progeny of dialects; and this he learnt not from the\r\nnatives, but from Father Thavenet, of the congregation of St. Sulpice,\r\nfor many years a missionary among that tribe, and perhaps more profoundly\r\nskilled in their language[486] than any European scholar before his time.\r\nOf the Algonquin Mezzofanti became completely master—a success which can\r\nonly be appreciated by those who understand the peculiar,[487] and to a\r\nEuropean entirely novel structure of these languages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut whatever uncertainty may exist as to the manner in which he acquired\r\nthese particular languages, there are many others with regard to which it\r\ncannot be doubted that he turned most industriously to account, during\r\nthese years, the many resources supplied by the Propaganda, and that to\r\nthis noble institution he was indebted for many of his later acquisitions.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be remembered, that, when Dr. Tholuck saw him in 1830,\r\nand changed quite suddenly to Arabic in the midst of a conversation in\r\nGerman, although he replied in that language “without hesitation and\r\nquite correctly,” yet he “spoke very slowly, and, as it were, composing\r\nthe words one with another.” Now Dr. O’Connor informs me, that, from the\r\nday of his first coming to the Propaganda, he “fastened upon” an Egyptian\r\nstudent named Sciahuan, with whom he conversed continually in Arabic; and\r\nthat he also undertook (thus enjoying an opportunity of practice in two\r\nlanguages at once,) to instruct in it a young Maltese, likewise a student\r\nof the college. With what success this twofold practice was attended may\r\nbe inferred from the fact, already recorded, that, a few years later,\r\nwhen M. d’Abbadie was in Rome (in 1839,) he was told by a native Syrian\r\nthat Mezzofanti’s fluency, as well as his knowledge of Arabic, were both\r\nadmirable.[488]\r\n\r\nAnother language which Mezzofanti, in 1839, told Dr. Tholuck he had\r\nstudied, but in which Dr. Tholuck had no means of trying him, was the\r\nAlbanese. The late M. Matranga mentioned that he also spoke this language\r\nwith some Albanian students who were in the Propaganda, soon after his\r\narrival in Rome: but that, as they were from upper Albania, and spoke a\r\ncorrupt half Turkish dialect of Albanese, he conversed but rarely with\r\nthem. I may add, however, that Signor Agostino Ricci who came to the\r\nPropaganda in 1846, assured me, in a note written two years since,[489]\r\nthat, between 1846, and the Cardinal’s death in 1849, he had “repeatedly\r\nconversed with him in Albanese, and that he spoke it very well.” (_assai\r\nbene_.)\r\n\r\nFor Armenian, Turkish, and Greek, the Propaganda also supplied abundant\r\nresources. The students, Hassun and Musabini—the first, it will be\r\nrecollected, whom Mezzofanti chanced to meet at his earliest visit—ever\r\nafterwards continued his especial favourites and friends. With the former\r\nhe always spoke in Turkish, with the latter in Greek. A youth named\r\nTigrani, supplied him with practice in Armenian; but to this language,\r\nwhich he enjoyed other opportunities of cultivating, he seldom devoted\r\nmuch of the time which he spent in the Propaganda. It was the same for\r\nmost of the European languages which he constantly met outside. In the\r\ncollege, for the most part, he confined himself to those which he had no\r\nmeans of cultivating elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWithout wearying the reader, however, with further details, I shall\r\ntranscribe (although it regards a later period,) an interesting letter\r\nreceived from the Rev. Charles Fernando, the missionary apostolic at the\r\nPoint of Galle in Ceylon, which enters briefly, but yet very fully and\r\ndistinctly, into the particulars of the languages which Mezzofanti used\r\nto speak in the Propaganda, during the writer’s residence there as a\r\nstudent. M. Fernando is a native of Colombo in the Island of Ceylon. He\r\ncame to Rome early in the year 1843, and remained until after the death\r\nof Cardinal Mezzofanti.\r\n\r\n    “When I left Ceylon for Rome,” he writes, August 29, 1855,\r\n    “I knew but very little of the Cingalese language; a very\r\n    small vocabulary of domestic words, and a facility in reading\r\n    in Cingalese characters, without understanding the written\r\n    language, was the full stock of my knowledge when I reached\r\n    the college of the Propaganda. From such a master you might be\r\n    disposed to augur badly of the scholar. Still it was not so.\r\n\r\n    A few days after my arrival in college, I was introduced to his\r\n    Eminence in his polyglot library and study room in the college\r\n    itself. Cardinal Mezzofanti knew nothing of the Cingalese\r\n    before I went to the Propaganda, yet in a few days he was able\r\n    to assist me to put together a short plain discourse for our\r\n    academical exhibition of the Epiphany.\r\n\r\n    My own knowledge of the language, nevertheless, was not at that\r\n    time such as to warrant my saying that he knew the Cingalese,\r\n    or that he spoke it well. This, however, I can assert\r\n    confidently, that, after a few conversations with me, (I don’t\r\n    recollect having been with him above a dozen times for the\r\n    purpose,) he thoroughly entered into the nature and system of\r\n    the Cingalese language.\r\n\r\n    Among the other languages of Hindostan, I can only speak as to\r\n    one. In my time there were no students who spoke the Mahratta,\r\n    Canarese, or Malayalim; but I heard him speak Hindostani with a\r\n    student who is now missionary apostolic in Agra, where he was\r\n    brought up, the Rev. William Keegan.\r\n\r\n    The most remarkable characteristic of the Cardinal as a\r\n    linguist was his power of passing from one language to another\r\n    without the least effort. I recollect having often seen him\r\n    speak to a whole _Camerata_ of the Propaganda students,\r\n    addressing each in his own language or dialect in rapid\r\n    succession, and with such ease, fluency, and spirit, and so\r\n    much of the character and tone of each language that it used\r\n    to draw a burst of merry laughter from the company; every one\r\n    delighted to have heard his own language spoken by the amiable\r\n    Cardinal with its characteristic precision. I may mention the\r\n    names of many with whom the Cardinal thus conversed; with Moses\r\n    Ngau (who died in Pegu not long ago) in the Peguan language;\r\n    with Zaccaria Cohen in Abyssinian; with Gabriel, another\r\n    Abyssinian, in the Amariña dialect; with Sciata, an Egyptian,\r\n    in the Coptic; with Hollas in Armenian; with Churi[490] in\r\n    Arabic; with Barsciu in Syriac; with Abdo in Arabico-maltese,\r\n    (the Maltese speak a mixture of Arabic and Italian); in Tamulic\r\n    with Pedro Royapen, (of this, however, I am not so sure);\r\n    with Leang and Mong in Chinese; with Jakopski and Arabagiski\r\n    in Bulgarian; with Beriscia and Baddovani in Albanian. With\r\n    regard to Malay, Tibetan, and Mantchu, I cannot bear witness,\r\n    as there were no students who spoke those dialects in my time.\r\n    As for the European languages, I can assure you that I heard\r\n    the Cardinal speak a great variety, Polish, Hungarian,[491]\r\n    Rhetian, Swedish, Danish, German, Russian, &c.”\r\n\r\nThe caution with which M. Fernando speaks on the subject of Cingalese,\r\nas well as of the rest of the Indian languages, makes his testimony in\r\nother respects more valuable, inasmuch as I had frequently heard it said\r\nin Rome that the Cardinal spoke “Hindostani and all the dialects of\r\nIndia.” It needed, however, but a moment’s recollection of the number\r\nand variety of these dialects, (several of which till very recently were\r\nalmost unknown even by name to Europeans,) to assure me that this was a\r\ngreat exaggeration. I am inclined to think that his knowledge of Indian\r\nlanguages lay entirely among those which are derived from the Sanscrit.\r\nThe notion of Colebrook and the philologers of his time, that all the\r\nlanguages of India are of Sanscrit origin, is now commonly abandoned.\r\nIt is found that the languages of the Deccan have but little of the\r\nSanscrit element; and Mr. Caldwell, in his recent comparative grammar\r\nof the South-Indian Languages,[492] has enumerated under the general\r\ndesignation of Dravidian, nine un-Sanscritic languages of this region\r\nof India, among which the best known are the Tamil, Telugu, Canarese,\r\nand Malayalim. There seems no reason to believe that Mezzofanti was\r\nfamiliarly acquainted with any one of these four, or indeed with any\r\nmember of Dravidian family, unless the Guzarattee can be included therein.\r\n\r\nM. Fernando’s hesitation regarding his knowledge of Tamil, induced me to\r\ninquire of Rev. Dr. MacAuliffe, lately a Missionary at Madras, who, after\r\nspending several years in that Presidency, had entered the Propaganda,\r\nand who knew the Cardinal at the same time with M. Fernando. Dr.\r\nMacAuliffe informs me, that his eminence did not know Tamil. The Indian\r\nlanguages which he knew, according to Dr. MacAuliffe, were Hindostani and\r\nMahratta; that he was acquainted with at least the first of these there\r\nseems no possible doubt, both from M. Fernando’s testimony, and from that\r\nof Count Lackersteen of Calcutta, a native East Indian gentleman, who\r\nassures me[493] that he conversed with him in Hindostani, in 1843-4. As\r\nto the Mahratta dialect, I have not (beyond Dr. MacAuliffe’s assurance)\r\nbeen able to obtain any direct information; but Mr. Eyoob, an Armenian\r\nmerchant of Calcutta, testifies to the Cardinal’s acquaintance with\r\nanother Indian language—the Guzarattee. Mr. Eyoob saw the Cardinal in\r\nthe same year with Count Lackersteen, and writes[494] that, when he\r\nwas introduced to his eminence as a native of Bombay, the Cardinal at\r\nonce addressed him in _Guzarattee_. Mr. Eyoob adds, that the Cardinal\r\nalso spoke with him in Armenian and in Portuguese, in both of which\r\nlanguages his accent, vocabulary, and grammatical accuracy, were beyond\r\nall exception. Count Lackersteen’s letter fully confirms so much of this\r\nstatement as regards Portuguese. The Count also spoke with Mezzofanti in\r\nPersian: but, as he does not profess to be a profound Persian scholar,\r\nhis testimony on this head is not of so much value.\r\n\r\nBy far the most remarkable, however, of Mezzofanti’s successes in the\r\nPropaganda was his acquisition of Chinese. The difficulty of that\r\nlanguage for Europeans has long been proverbial,[495] and it argued no\r\nordinary courage in a scholar now on the verge of his sixtieth year to\r\nenter regularly upon such a study. His first progress at Naples, before\r\nhe was interrupted by the severe illness which there seized him, has\r\nbeen already described. It was not for a considerable time after his\r\nreturn, that he was enabled to resume the attempt systematically. A\r\nwish was expressed by the authorities of the Propaganda that a select\r\nnumber of the students of the Naples college should be sent to Rome for\r\nthe completion of their theological studies. Three young Chinese had\r\nalready visited the Propaganda while Mezzofanti was still in Bologna,\r\none of whom, named Pacifico Yu, offered himself to the Cardinal Prefect,\r\nas a missionary to the Corea, at a period when the attempt was almost\r\na certain road to martyrdom: but it was not until the year 1835-6 that\r\nthe design of adopting a few of the Neapolitan students into the college\r\nof the Propaganda was actually carried out. Don Raffaelle Umpierres,\r\nfor many years Procurator of the mission at Macao, was soon afterwards\r\nappointed their prefect and professor; and under his auspices and with\r\nthe assistance of the young Chinese, Mezzofanti resumed the study with\r\nnew energy. His success is admitted on all hands to have been almost\r\nunexampled. Certainly it has never been surpassed by any European\r\nnot resident in China. In the year 1843, I was myself present while\r\nhe conversed with two youths, named Leang and Mong, and although my\r\nevidence cannot extend beyond these external signs, I can at least bear\r\nwitness to the fluency with which he spoke, and the ease and spirit with\r\nwhich he seemed to sustain the conversation. But his complete success\r\nis placed beyond all doubt by an attestation forwarded to me, by the\r\nabate Umpierres, the Chinese Professor,[496] already named, who declares\r\nthat he “frequently conversed with the Cardinal in Chinese, from the\r\nyear 1837, up to the date of his death, and that he not only spoke the\r\nmandarin Chinese,[497] but understood other dialects of the language.”\r\n\r\nMezzofanti himself freely confessed the exceeding difficulty which he\r\nhad found in mastering this language. It cost him, as he assured Father\r\nArsenius Angiarakian, four months of uninterrupted study. Speaking\r\nonce with Cardinal Wiseman of his method of linguistic study, he said\r\nthat the “ear and not the eye was for him the ordinary medium through\r\nwhich language was conveyed;” and he added, that the true origin of the\r\ndifficulty which he had felt in learning Chinese, was not so much the\r\nnovelty of its words and forms, as the fact that, departing from the\r\nanalogy of other languages, it disconcerted the pre-arranged system on\r\nwhich he had theretofore proceeded; it _has an eye-language distinct from\r\nthe ear-language_, which he was obliged to make an especial study.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to mention that the Cardinal successfully accomplished\r\nin a short time what cost the missionaries in China, with all their\r\nadvantages of position, many years of labour, having actually preached\r\nto the Chinese students in the Propaganda, on occasion of one of the\r\nspiritual retreats which are periodically observed in ecclesiastical\r\nseminaries.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that the Propaganda was his only school\r\nof languages. Not unfrequently, also, missionaries from various parts of\r\nthe world, who repaired to the Propaganda on the affairs of their several\r\nmissions, supplied a sort of supplement to the ordinary resources of\r\nthe institution. In this way a German missionary, Father Brunner, (now,\r\nI believe, superior of a religious congregation in the United States,)\r\ninitiated him in the languages of Western Africa. Father Brunner had been\r\nfor a time a missionary in Congo. On his arrival in Rome, Mezzofanti\r\nplaced himself in communication with him; and Cardinal Reisach, (who was\r\nat that time Rector of the Propaganda,) states that he soon progressed\r\nso far as to be able to keep up a conversation in the language. The\r\ngeneral language of Congo comprises many distinct branches, the Loango,\r\nthe Kakongo, the Mandongo, the Angolese, and the Camba.[498] Of these\r\nMezzofanti applied himself especially to the Angolese, in which he more\r\nthan once composed pieces for recitation at the academical exhibition of\r\nthe Epiphany. Two of these, which will be found in the appendix, have\r\nbeen submitted to the criticism of Mr. Consul Brande, long a resident\r\nat Loango, who pronounces them “to exhibit a correct knowledge of the\r\nAngolese or Bunda language.”[499]\r\n\r\nI may add to the number of those with whom he was accustomed to speak\r\noriental languages, two others mentioned to me by Cardinal Wiseman. The\r\nfirst was a learned Chaldean, Paul Alkushi, who had once been a student\r\nof the Propaganda, but relinquished the intention of embracing the\r\necclesiastical profession. The other was a converted Jew, a native of\r\nBagdad, and who, although otherwise illiterate, spoke fluently Hebrew,\r\nArabic, and Persian. He was familiarly known in Rome by the sobriquet of\r\n“_Shalom_,” from the habitual salutation with which he used to address\r\nhis friends at meeting and parting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe only letters of this period which I have been able to procure are\r\ntwo, addressed to his Bolognese friends, Michael Ferrucci and Liborio\r\nVeggetti. The former (dated June 6th, 1836,) is in acknowledgment of some\r\ncopies of Latin Epigrams, partly from his own pen, partly from that of\r\nthe Canonico Schiassi, which Ferrucci had sent to Mezzofanti: but it is\r\nchiefly noticeable for the warm interest which it evinces in the welfare\r\nof his old friend, who had written to ask advice and assistance in his\r\ncandidature for a professorship in one of the Tuscan Universities, Signor\r\nFerrucci, some time afterwards, went to Geneva, as professor of rhetoric,\r\nbut he eventually obtained an appointment in the University of Pisa,\r\nwhere he is now Librarian.\r\n\r\nThe letter to Veggetti, (February 17, 1838,) regards his appointment as\r\nLibrarian of the University of Bologna, in which Mezzofanti had been\r\nmuch interested.\r\n\r\n    “I am delighted that my wishes have not been in vain or\r\n    without effect, and that the Library, for so many years the\r\n    object of my care, is confided to the direction of an old and\r\n    distinguished pupil of my own. I need not give you any advice,\r\n    knowing, as I do, what exactness and assiduity you have always\r\n    shown in the discharge of your duties. Knowing, also, the good\r\n    understanding you maintain with my nephew, Monsignor Minarelli,\r\n    in whom I repose the fullest confidence, I need only say that\r\n    if you consult with him in any doubt which may arise regarding\r\n    your duties, it will be the same as if you were speaking with\r\n    the old librarian himself.\r\n\r\n    I must confess I am more gratified at your having obtained this\r\n    appointment, than if you had been appointed to the chair of\r\n    History, a difficult post, and more difficult the farther one\r\n    advances. And while I congratulate you, I must also felicitate\r\n    myself on leaving in such excellent hands the precious deposit\r\n    hitherto entrusted to my own care. I will not fail to profit by\r\n    your work which you have so kindly presented to me.”\r\n\r\nDr. Veggetti still holds the office of Librarian at Bologna. He continued\r\nto correspond occasionally with Mezzofanti, up to the period of his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n[1838-1841.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the offices connected with the Roman Court, there is a certain\r\nclass, known as _Poste Cardinalizie_, the tenure of which is, in the\r\nordinary course of affairs, a step to the Cardinalate. The chief\r\nkeepership of the Vatican Library is not necessarily one of these;\r\nbut it had long been known that Monsignor Mezzofanti was destined for\r\nthe purple; and, in a consistory held on the 12th of February, 1838,\r\nhe was “preconized” as Cardinal Priest, in company with three other\r\nprelates—Angelo Mai, (who had been “reserved _in petto_” from the former\r\nyear,) Orioli, and Mellini.\r\n\r\nThe order of Cardinal Priests, as is well known, are the representatives,\r\nin the more modern constitution of the Roman church, of the ancient\r\n_Presbyteri Cardinales_—the priests of the principal churches in which\r\nBaptism was administered, (_tituli Cardinales_) of the ancient city.\r\nTheir number, which at the end of the fifth century was twenty-five, has\r\nbeen gradually increased to fifty: but the memory of their primitive\r\ninstitution is preserved in the titles under which they are named, and\r\nwhich are taken from the churches over which the ancient Presbyters\r\npresided. The title of Cardinal Mezzofanti was derived from the ancient\r\nchurch of Saint Onuphrius, (Sant’ Onofrio,) on the Janiculum, which is\r\nprobably best known to visitors of Rome as the last resting-place of the\r\npoet Tasso.\r\n\r\nTo many persons, no doubt, the office of Cardinal has but little\r\nsignificance, except as a part of the stately ceremonial of the Roman\r\ncourt—a brilliant and enviable sinecure, sometimes the reward of\r\ndistinguished merit, sometimes the prize of political influence or\r\nhereditary family claims. But to well informed readers it is scarcely\r\nnecessary to explain that the College of Cardinals forms, or rather\r\nsupplies, the entire deliberative and executive administration of the\r\nPope in the general management of the affairs of the Church; holding\r\npermanently and systematically the place of the council of which we so\r\noften read in the early centuries. By the ancient constitution of the\r\nSacred College, all matters of importance were considered and discussed\r\nin the general meeting of the body, called the Consistory; but, in\r\nthe multiplication of business, it became necessary to distribute the\r\nlabour; and, since the latter part of the sixteenth century,[500] under\r\nthe great administrative Pontiffs, Paul IV., Pius IV., Pius V., and\r\nabove all Sixtus V., a system of “_congregations_” has arisen, by\r\nwhich, as by a series of committees, the details of all the various\r\ndepartments are administered; yet under the general superintendence of\r\nthe Pope himself, and subject, in all things, to his final revision.\r\nSome of these congregations, (which amount to nearly twenty in all,)\r\nconsist exclusively of Cardinals; some are composed both of Cardinals\r\nand prelates; and a few of prelates only: but, in almost every case,\r\nthe Prefect, at least, of the congregation is a Cardinal. Some\r\ncongregations meet every week, others only once a month; but in all\r\nthe leading ones, as for instance in the Propaganda, there is a weekly\r\nmeeting (_congresso_) of the Prefect and secretary with the clerks or\r\n_minutanti_, for the despatch of pressing business or of affairs of\r\nroutine; all the business of these meetings being submitted to the Pope\r\nfor his approval.\r\n\r\nTo each Cardinal, either as Prefect, or at least as member, four of\r\nthese congregations, as an ordinary rule, are assigned at his first\r\nappointment; in many cases, the number is afterwards increased; and,\r\nwhen it is remembered that in many of these the business is weighty\r\nand complicated, often involving much documentary matter, extensive\r\ntheological or canonical research, and careful investigation of\r\nprecedents, &c.; and that these congregations, after all, form but a part\r\nof the duties of a Cardinal; it will be understood that his position is\r\nvery far from the sinecure which the unreflecting may suppose it to be.\r\n\r\nIn the congregations assigned to Cardinal Mezzofanti at his nomination,\r\nregard was of course paid to his peculiar qualifications. He was named\r\nPrefect of the “Congregation for the correction of the Liturgical Books\r\nof the Oriental Church,” and also of the “Congregation of Studies.”\r\nHe was also, on the same grounds, appointed a member, not only of the\r\ngeneral “Congregation of the Propaganda,” but also of the special one “On\r\nthe affairs of the Chinese Mission,” and of those of “the Index,” “of\r\nRites,” and of “the Examination of Bishops.”\r\n\r\nWith a similar consideration for his well known habits and tastes, and\r\nwith a due appreciation of the charity for the sick which had always\r\ncharacterized him, he was named President of the great Hospital of San\r\nSalvatore, and visitor of the House of Catechumens, in which, as being\r\nchiefly destined for converted Jews and Mahomedans, his acquaintance with\r\nthe Hebrew and Arabic languages and literatures rendered his services\r\npeculiarly valuable.\r\n\r\nThe official revenue assigned from the Civil List for a cardinal resident\r\nin Rome, is four thousand Roman crowns (between eight and nine hundred\r\npounds sterling); by far the greater part of which is absorbed in the\r\nnecessary expenses of his household, the payment of his chaplain,\r\nsecretary, and servants, the maintenance of his state equipage, &c.;\r\nso that for those cardinals who, like Mezzofanti, possess no private\r\nfortune, the remnant available for purely personal expenditure is very\r\ntrifling indeed. With Mezzofanti’s frugal and simple habits, however, it\r\nnot only proved amply sufficient to supply all his own modest wants,\r\nbut also enabled him to enlarge and extend the unostentatious charities\r\nwhich, throughout his entire life, he had never failed to bestow, even\r\nwhile he was himself struggling against the disadvantages of a narrow\r\nand precarious income. So well known, indeed, were his almost prodigal\r\ncharities, while in charge of the Vatican, and his consequent poverty at\r\nthe time of his nomination to the Cardinalate, that the Pope, Gregory\r\nXVI., himself presented him, from the Pontifical establishment, the two\r\nstate carriages[501] which form the necessary equipage of a Cardinal in\r\nall processions and other occasions of public ceremonial.\r\n\r\nHe selected for his residence the Palazzo Valentiniani, in the Piazza\r\nSS. Apostoli; where his nephew, Gaetano Minarelli, and Anna, one of\r\nhis unmarried nieces, came to live with him on his nomination to the\r\nCardinalate, and continued to reside until his death.\r\n\r\nThe news of his elevation was received with great pleasure at Bologna,\r\nand was the occasion of many public and private demonstrations. The\r\nmost remarkable of these was from the Academy of the _Filopieri_, of\r\nwhich he had been the President at the time of his removal from Bologna.\r\nThe Italians are singularly conservative of established forms; the\r\nmembers of the Academy, in accordance with a usage which may almost be\r\ncalled classical, met in full assembly (with all the accompaniments of\r\ndecorations, inscriptions, and music, in which Italian taste is displayed\r\non such occasions), to congratulate their fellow-academician. The\r\ncongratulatory addresses, however, which in England would have been a set\r\nof speeches and resolutions, here, as became the “Lovers of the Muses,”\r\ntook a poetical form; and a series of odes, sonnets,[502] elegies,\r\n_canzoni_, _terzine_, and epigrams, in Greek, Latin, and Italian, were\r\nrecited by the members. Some of them are exceedingly spirited and\r\ngraceful. They were all collected into a little volume, which, with great\r\ndelicacy and good taste, is dedicated not to the Cardinal himself, but to\r\nhis nephew, Monsignor Joseph Minarelli, of whom I have already spoken,\r\nand who was at this time Rector of the university of Bologna.[503]\r\n\r\nA still more characteristic tribute on his elevation was a polyglot\r\nvisit of congratulation from his young friends in the Propaganda. A\r\nparty of fifty-three, comprising all the languages and nationalities at\r\nthat time represented in the institution, waited upon him to offer their\r\ngreetings in their various tongues. The new Cardinal was at once amused\r\nby the novel exhibition, and gratified by the compliment thus delicately\r\nimplied. True, however, to his old character for readiness and dexterity,\r\nhe was found fully equal to the occasion, and answered each in his own\r\nlanguage with great spirit and precision.[504]\r\n\r\nCardinal Mezzofanti’s elevation, of course, brought him into closer,\r\nand, if possible, more affectionate relations with the Pope. Among\r\nhis brethren of the Sacred College, too, there were many whom, even\r\nas prelate, he could call his friends. I have already spoken of his\r\nrelations with the learned Cardinal Giustiniani, and the venerable\r\nCardinal Pacca. With Cardinal Lambruschini, the Secretary of State, and\r\nCardinal Fransoni, Prefect of the Propaganda, he had long been on a\r\nfooting of most confidential intimacy. His especial friends, however,\r\nwere Cardinals Mai, Polidori, Bernetti, and the amiable and learned\r\nEnglish Cardinal Acton, who, although not proclaimed till 1842, was named\r\n_in petto_ in the year after the elevation of Cardinal Mezzofanti.[505]\r\n\r\nBut, with the exception of the public and ceremonial observances which\r\nhis new dignity exacted, it brought no change in his simple, and almost\r\nascetic manner of life. The externals of his household, of course,\r\nunderwent considerable alteration, but his personal habits remained the\r\nsame. He continued to rise at the same hour: his morning devotions,\r\nhis daily mass, his visits to the hospitals, and other private acts\r\nof charity, remained unaltered. His table, though displaying somewhat\r\nmore ceremonial, continued almost as frugal, and entirely as simple, as\r\nbefore his elevation. He persevered, unless when prevented by his various\r\nofficial duties, in paying his daily visit to the Propaganda, and in\r\nassisting and directing the studies of its young inmates, with all his\r\naccustomed friendliness and familiarity. His affability to visitors,\r\neven of the humblest class, was, if possible, increased. Above all, as\r\nregarded his favourite studies, and the exercise of his wonderful talent,\r\nhis elevation to the Cardinalate brought no abatement of enthusiasm, and\r\nno relaxation of energy. It is not merely that the visitors who saw him\r\nas Cardinal, concur in attesting the unaltered activity of his mind, and\r\nthe undiminished interest with which he availed himself of every new\r\nopportunity of perfecting or exercising his favourite accomplishment.\r\nFor years after his elevation, he continued to add zealously and\r\nsuccessfully to the stores which he had already laid up. There is\r\ndistinct evidence that after this period, (although he had now entered\r\nupon his sixty-fourth year,) he acquired several languages, with which he\r\nhad previously had little, and perhaps no acquaintance.\r\n\r\nA very interesting instance has been communicated to me by M. Antoine\r\nd’Abbadie,[506] who visited the Cardinal in 1839, at Rome. M. d’Abbadie\r\nhad been a traveller from early manhood. Setting out in the year 1837,\r\nin company with his brother Arnauld, to explore the sources of the\r\nWhite Nile, he traversed the greater part of north eastern Africa.\r\nTheir wanderings, however, proved a mission of religion and charity, no\r\nless than of science. During their long and varied intercourse with the\r\nseveral tribes of Abyssinia, they observed with painful interest that\r\nstrange admixture of primitive Catholic truth with gross and revolting\r\nsuperstition by which all travellers have been struck; and their first\r\ncare was to study carefully the condition of the country and the\r\ncharacter of the people, with a view to the organization of a judicious\r\nand effective missionary expedition by which their many capabilities\r\nfor good might be developed. Hence, it is that, while their letters,\r\nreports, and essays, communicated to the various scientific journals and\r\nsocieties of France and England,[507] have added largely to our knowledge\r\nof the languages,[508] the geography, and the natural history of these\r\nimperfectly explored provinces, their services to the Church by the\r\nintroduction of missionaries, by the advice and information which they\r\nhave uniformly afforded them, and even by their own personal co-operation\r\nin the great work, have entitled them to the gratitude of all to whom the\r\ninterests of truth and civilization are dear.\r\n\r\nM. Antoine d’Abbadie, after two years spent in such labours, returned\r\nto Europe in 1839, for the purpose of preparing himself for a further\r\nand more systematic exploration. On arriving in Rome, he took an early\r\nopportunity of waiting upon the Cardinal, accompanied by two Abyssinians,\r\nwho spoke only the Amarinna language, and by a Galla servant, whose\r\nnative (and only) language was the Ilmorma, a tongue almost entirely\r\nunknown, even to the learned in this branch of philology.[509] M.\r\nd’Abbadie himself spoke Basque, a language which was still new to\r\nMezzofanti; and he was thus witness of what was certainly a very unwonted\r\nscene—the great Polyglottist completely at fault.\r\n\r\n    “I saw Cardinal Mezzofanti,” writes M. d’Abbadie, “in 1839.\r\n    He asked me in Arabic what language I wished to speak, and I,\r\n    in order to test him, proposed conversing in Basque. I am far\r\n    from knowing this idiom well; but, as I transact my farmer’s\r\n    business in Basque, I can easily puzzle a foreigner in it. The\r\n    Cardinal waived my proposal, and asked me what African language\r\n    I would speak. I now spoke Amarinna, i.e., the language named\r\n    _Ancharica_ by Ludolf, who probably added the final _c_ in\r\n    order to suit the word to Latin articulation. Not being able\r\n    to answer in Amarinna, Mezzofanti said: _Ti amirnu timhirta\r\n    lisana Gi-iz_ (‘Have you the knowledge of the Gi-iz language?’)\r\n    This was well said, and beautifully pronounced, but shewed\r\n    that the Cardinal got his knowledge of Gi-iz from persons who\r\n    read, but did not speak it in general. I afterwards ascertained\r\n    in Abyssinia that no professor, i.e., no person accustomed to\r\n    colloquial Gi-iz, had been yet in Rome, during this century at\r\n    least. I may here mention that Gi-iz, generally called Ethiopic\r\n    in Europe, is the liturgical language in Abyssinia, where it\r\n    is looked on by the learned as a dead language, although it\r\n    is still spoken by at least one of the shepherd tribes near\r\n    the Red Sea. In my visit to Cardinal Mezzofanti, I had with me\r\n    two Amara Abyssines, with whom he could not speak, as neither\r\n    of them knew Gi-iz enough, and I had not yet learned that\r\n    language. My third companion was a Galla, who had taught me his\r\n    language, viz., Ilmorma, in a most tedious way, for he knew no\r\n    other tongue, and I was forced to elicit every meaning by a\r\n    slowly convergent series of questions, which I put every time\r\n    he used a word new to me. Some of these had until then remained\r\n    a mystery to me; as the word _self_, and some others of the\r\n    same abstract class. I had likewise laboured in vain to get\r\n    the Ilmorma word for ‘soul’; and having mentioned all this to\r\n    Mezzofanti, I added, that as a philologist and a father of the\r\n    church, he could render me no better service than giving me the\r\n    means of teaching my Galla barbarian that he had a soul to be\r\n    saved. ‘Could not your eminence,’ said I, ‘find the means of\r\n    learning from this African what is the word for soul? I have\r\n    written twelve hundred words of his language, which you will\r\n    certainly turn to better account than I can.’ The Cardinal\r\n    made no direct answer. I saw him several times afterwards,\r\n    and he always addressed me in Arabic; but, being a tyro in\r\n    that language, I could not pretend to judge his knowledge or\r\n    fluency. However, a native Syrian then in Rome, told me that\r\n    both were admirable: this referred, I suppose now, to the\r\n    Syrian dialect.”\r\n\r\nA failure so unusual for Mezzofanti, and in so many languages, could\r\nnot but prove a stimulus to the industry of this indefatigable student.\r\nHe was at the moment busily engaged in the revision of the Maronite and\r\nArmenian liturgies;—a circumstance, by the way, which perhaps may account\r\nfor his passing over without notice, M. d’Abbadie’s proposal about the\r\nGalla language;—but, a few months later, he addressed himself to the\r\nAmarinna with all the energy of his most youthful days. How it ended, we\r\nshall see.\r\n\r\nIn the close of July, 1841, when I first had the honour of seeing him,\r\nhe was surrounded by a group of Abyssinians, who had just come to Rome\r\nunder the escort of Monsignor de Jacobis, the apostolic Prefect of the\r\nAbyssinian mission. These Abyssinians were all reputed to be persons\r\nof distinction among their countrymen, and several of the number were\r\nunderstood to be professors and men of letters. The Cardinal was speaking\r\nto them freely and without embarrassment; and his whole manner, as well\r\nas theirs, appeared to me (so far as one entirely unacquainted with\r\nthe language could judge) to indicate that he spoke with ease, and was\r\nunderstood by them without an effort. Thinking it probable, however, that\r\nM. d’Abbadie during his second sojourn in Abyssinia, must have known\r\nsomething of this mission, I thought it well to write to him on the\r\nsubject. He informed me, in reply, that the Abyssinians whom I had thus\r\nseen were a deputation of the schismatical Christians of that country,\r\nwho had been sent by the native chieftains to Alexandria, to obtain\r\nfrom the Patriarch (to whom they so far recognise their subjection) the\r\nconsecration of the Abun, or Primate, of their national church. Father\r\nde Jacobis, who was their fellow-traveller as far as Alexandria, induced\r\nthem to accompany him to Rome, where they were so much struck with all\r\nthat they saw and heard, that “two out of the three professors of Gondar,\r\nwho were the leaders of the deputation, have, since their return, freely\r\nand knowingly entered the one true Church—Amari, Kanfu, and the one-eyed\r\nprofessor, Gab’ra Mikaël.” One of these told M. d’Abbadie that “Cardinal\r\nMezzofanti conversed very well with him in Amarinna, and that he also\r\nknew the Gi-iz language.” He had thus learned the Amarinna between 1839\r\nand 1841.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am indebted to M. d’Abbadie for an account of another still later\r\nacquisition of the Cardinal’s declining years. Before the summer of 1841,\r\nhe had acquired the Amarinna language. Now at that time he was actually\r\nengaged, with all the energy of his early years, in the study of the\r\nproverbially “impossible”[510] Basque, in which, as we have seen, M.\r\nd’Abbadie found him a novice in 1839.\r\n\r\nOne of my companions in Rome in 1841, the lamented Guido Görres, of\r\nMunich, son of the venerable author of that name, and himself one of the\r\nmost accomplished writers of Catholic Germany, having chanced to say to\r\nthe Cardinal that he was then engaged in the study of Basque, the latter\r\nproposed that they should pursue it in company. Their readings had only\r\njust commenced when I last saw Herr Görres; but M. d’Abbadie’s testimony\r\nat a later date places the Cardinal’s success in this study likewise\r\nentirely beyond question. He had not only learned before the year 1844,\r\nthe general body of the language, but even mastered its various dialects\r\nso as to be able to converse both in the Labourdain and the Souletin;\r\nwhich, it should be observed, are not simply dialects of Basque, but\r\nminor sub-divisions of one out of the four leading dialects which prevail\r\nin the different districts of Biscay and Navarre.\r\n\r\n    “My friend M. Dassance,” says M. d’Abbadie, “who has published\r\n    several works, and who, after declining a bishopric, is still\r\n    a canon in the Bayonne Cathedral, told me the other day, that,\r\n    on visiting the Cardinal in 1844, he was surprised to hear him\r\n    speak French with that peculiar Parisian accent which pertains\r\n    to the ancient nobility of the Faubourg St. Germain. This is a\r\n    nice distinction of which several Frenchmen are not aware. On\r\n    hearing that Dassance was a Basque, the Cardinal immediately\r\n    said: _Mingo zitugu?_ (_verbatim_—‘Of whence have we you’?)\r\n    thus shewing that he had mastered the tremendous difficulty of\r\n    our vernacular verb. The ensuing conversation took place in the\r\n    pure Labourdain dialect, which is spoken here (at Urrugne,)\r\n    but one of the professors of the Bayonne Seminary, Father\r\n    Chilo, from Soule, avers that the Cardinal spoke to him in the\r\n    Souletin dialect.”[511]\r\n\r\nI afterwards shewed to M. d’Abbadie a short sentence in Basque which the\r\nCardinal wrote with his own hand, and which is printed among the fac\r\nsimiles prefixed to this volume.\r\n\r\n    Tauna! zu servitzea da erreguiñatea;\r\n    Zu maitatzea da zoriona,\r\n    “Lord! to serve Thee is to reign;\r\n    To love Thee, is happiness.”\r\n\r\nM. d’Abbadie, as also his Highness Prince Lewis L. Bonaparte, to whom M.\r\nd’Abbadie submitted it, had some doubt as to the propriety of the form,\r\n‘_zu_ servitzea,’ ‘_zu_ maitatzea’; both of them preferring to write\r\n_zure_. But, as the dialect in which the sentence is written is that\r\nof Guipuscoa, both his Highness and M. d’Abbadie have kindly taken the\r\ntrouble to refer the question to native Guipuscoan scholars; and I have\r\nhad the gratification to learn by a letter of M. d’Abbadie, (January\r\n18th, 1858,) that “the construction ‘_zu_ servitzea,’ is perfectly\r\ncorrect in Guipuscoan.”\r\n\r\nM. d’Abbadie subjoins, that, in addition to the authority of his friend,\r\nM. Dassance, for the Cardinal’s knowledge of Basque, he has since been\r\nassured by a Spanish lady, a native of San Sebastian, the capital of\r\nGuipuscoa, that the Cardinal had also conversed with her in her native\r\nGuipuscoan dialect. Moreover, when M. Manavit saw him in Rome in 1846,\r\nhe translated freely in his presence a newly published Basque catechism,\r\nwhich M. Manavit presented to him on the part of the Bishop of Astros:\r\nand several distinguished Biscayan ecclesiastics assured M. Manavit that\r\nthe Cardinal spoke both the dialects of Basque with equal fluency.[512]\r\nIn a word, it appears impossible to doubt the complete success of this,\r\none of his latest essays in the acquisition of a new language.\r\n\r\nAs the object of this biography, however, is not merely to bring together\r\nsuch marvels as these, but to collect all the materials for a just\r\nportraiture of the linguist himself, I must place in contrast with these\r\ntruly wonderful narratives, the judgments of other travellers, in order\r\nthat the reader may be enabled to modify each by comparison with its\r\npendant, and to form his own estimate from a just combination of both.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed, as a set off against the wonders which have been\r\njust recounted, that there were others of Mezzofanti’s visitors who were\r\nunable to see in him any of these excellencies. I think, however, that\r\nthese depreciatory judgments will be found for the most part to proceed\r\nfrom ignorant and superficial tourists, and from those who are least\r\nqualified to form an accurate estimate of the attainments of a linguist.\r\nOne of the heaviest penalties of eminence is the exposure which it\r\ninvolves to impertinent or malevolent criticism, nor is it wonderful that\r\none who received so great a variety of visitors as did Mezzofanti, should\r\nhave had his share of this infliction.\r\n\r\nMrs. Paget, a Transylvanian lady, married to an English gentleman, who\r\nsaw Mezzofanti a little before M. d’Abbadie, is cited by Mr. Watts.[513]\r\nHer characteristic is rather recklessness and ill-breeding than positive\r\nmalevolence. But as her strictures, ill-bred as they are, contain some\r\nfacts which tend to illustrate the main subject of inquiry, I shall\r\ninsert them without abridgment.\r\n\r\n    “Mezzofanti entered, in conversation with two young Moors,\r\n    and, turning to us, asked us to be seated. On me his first\r\n    appearance produced an unfavourable impression. His age might\r\n    be about seventy; he was small in stature, dry, and of a pale\r\n    unhealthy look. His whole person was in monkey-like restless\r\n    motion. We conversed together for some time. He speaks\r\n    Hungarian well enough, and his pronunciation is not bad. I\r\n    asked him from whom he had learned it; he said from the common\r\n    soldiers at Milan. He had read the works of Kisfaludi and\r\n    Csokonai, Pethe’s Natural History, and some other Hungarian\r\n    books, but it seemed to me that he rather studies the words\r\n    than the subject of what he reads. Some English being present,\r\n    he spoke English with them very fluently and well; with me\r\n    he afterwards spoke French and German, and he even addressed\r\n    me in Wallachian; but to my shame I was unable to answer. He\r\n    asked if I knew Slowakian. In showing us some books, he read\r\n    out from them in Ancient and Modern Greek, Latin and Hebrew. To\r\n    a priest who was with us, and who had travelled in Palestine,\r\n    he spoke in Turkish. I asked him how many languages he knew:\r\n    ‘Not many,’ he replied, ‘for I only speak forty or fifty.’\r\n    Amazing incomprehensible faculty! but not one that I should\r\n    in the least be tempted to envy; for the empty unreflecting\r\n    word-knowledge, and the innocently exhibited small vanity\r\n    with which he was filled, reminded me rather of a monkey or\r\n    a parrot, a talking machine, or a sort of organ wound up for\r\n    the performance of certain tunes, than of a being endowed with\r\n    reason. He can, in fact, only be looked upon as one of the\r\n    curiosities of the Vatican.\r\n\r\n    “At parting, I took an opportunity of asking if he would allow\r\n    me to present an Hungarian book to the Vatican library. My\r\n    first care at my hotel was to send a copy of M. W.’s book,\r\n    ‘Balitéletekröl’ (‘On Prejudices’)[514] to the binder, and\r\n    a few days afterwards I took it, handsomely bound in white\r\n    leather, to Mezzofanti, whom I found in a hurry to go and\r\n    baptize some Jews and Moors. As soon as he saw the book,\r\n    without once looking into it, even to ascertain the name of the\r\n    author, he called out, ‘Ah! igen szép, igen szép, munka. Szepen\r\n    van bekötve. Aranyos, szép, szép, igen szép, igen koszönöm.’\r\n    (Ah! very fine, very fine, very finely bound. Beautiful, very\r\n    fine, very fine, thank you very much;)—and put it away in a\r\n    book-case. Unhappy Magyar volumes, never looked at out of their\r\n    own country, but by some curious student of philology like\r\n    Mezzofanti, and in their own country read by how few!”\r\n\r\nNow, in the first place, in the midst of this lady’s supercilious and\r\ndepreciatory strictures, it may safely be inferred, that Mezzofanti’s\r\nHungarian at least must have been unexceptionable, in order to draw\r\nfrom one so evidently prejudiced, the admission that he “spoke it well\r\nenough,” and that “his pronunciation was not bad.” Lest, however, any\r\ndoubt should be created by these grudging acknowledgments, I shall quote\r\nthe testimony of a Hungarian nobleman, Baron Glucky de Stenitzer, who\r\nmet the Cardinal in Rome some years later, in 1845. The Baron not only\r\ntestifies to the excellence of his Magyar, but affirms “that, in the\r\ncourse of the interview, his Eminence spoke no less than four different\r\ndialects of that tongue—the pure Magyar of Debreczeny, that of the\r\nenvirons of Eperies, that of Pesth, and that of Transylvania!”\r\n\r\nIn like manner, though Madame Paget takes upon her to say, that “the\r\nCardinal studies the words rather than the subject of what he reads,”\r\nBaron Glucky found him “profoundly versed in the laws and constitution\r\nof Hungary”; and when, in speaking of the extraordinary power enjoyed by\r\nthe Primate of Hungary, the Baron chanced to allude to his privilege of\r\ncoining money, his Eminence promptly reminded him that “this privilege\r\nhad been withdrawn by the Emperor Ferdinand, and even quoted the year of\r\nthe edict by which it was annulled!”[515]\r\n\r\nAs regards the dashing style in which this lady sets aside the Cardinal’s\r\nMagyar reading, which _only_ embraced “the works of Kisfaludi and\r\nCzokonai, Pethe’s Natural History, and some other Hungarian books,” it\r\nmay be enough for the reader to know that, without reckoning the “other\r\nHungarian books,” the three works which she names thus slightingly,\r\ncomprise no less than _seven volumes_ of poetry and miscellaneous\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nFor what remains of her strictures upon the character of\r\nMezzofanti—strictures be it observed, which she has the hardihood to\r\noffer, although her entire knowledge was derived from two interviews\r\nof a few minutes, among a crowd of other visitors—her charge of love\r\nof display, “empty word-knowledge,” “monkey-like” exhibition, and the\r\nother pettinesses of “small vanity,” the best commentary that can be\r\noffered is an account of the Cardinal published at this very period, by\r\none who knew him intimately during a residence of many months in Rome,\r\nwho was actually for a time his pupil or fellow student, and who, from\r\nhis position, was thoroughly conversant, not only with the sentiments\r\nof the Cardinal’s friends and admirers, but with all the variety of\r\ncriticisms to which, according to the diversity of tastes and opinions,\r\nhis character and his gifts were subjected in the general society of the\r\nliterary circles of Rome—I mean the amiable and learned Guido Görres.\r\nI may add that I myself was Herr Görres’s companion in one of his\r\ninterviews with the Cardinal.\r\n\r\n    “If any one should imagine,” he writes, (in the\r\n    Historisch-Politische Blätter,[516] of which, conjointly with\r\n    Dr. Phillips, he was editor,) “that all the honours which\r\n    he has received have produced the slightest effect upon his\r\n    character or disposition, he is grievously mistaken. Under all\r\n    the insignia of the cardinalate, Mezzofanti is still the same\r\n    plain, simple, almost bashful, good-natured, conscientious,\r\n    indefatigable, active priest that he was, while a poor\r\n    professor, struggling by the exercise of his talents, in the\r\n    humblest form, to gain a livelihood for the relatives who were\r\n    dependant on his exertions. Although his head is stored with so\r\n    many languages, it has never, as so frequently occurs to the\r\n    learned, shown the least indication of lightness. As Prefect of\r\n    the House of Catechumens he is merely of course, charged with\r\n    the supervision of their instruction; but he still discharges\r\n    the duty in person, with all the exactness of a conscientious\r\n    schoolmaster. He visits the establishment almost every day, and\r\n    devotes a considerable part of his income to the support of its\r\n    inmates.\r\n\r\n    In like manner he still, as Cardinal, maintains with the\r\n    Propaganda precisely the same relations which he held as\r\n    a simple prelate. Although he is not bound thereto by any\r\n    possible obligation, he devotes every day to the students of\r\n    that institution, in summer an hour, in winter an hour and\r\n    a half. He practises them and also himself in their several\r\n    languages, and zealously avails himself of the opportunity thus\r\n    afforded him, to exhort them to piety and to strengthen them in\r\n    the spirit of their calling.\r\n\r\n    It is scarcely necessary to say that these youths regard their\r\n    disinterested friend and benefactor with the most devoted\r\n    affection....\r\n\r\n    When I spoke to him, one day, about his relations with the\r\n    pupils, he said to me, ‘It is not as a Cardinal I go there; it\r\n    is as a student—as a youth—(giovanetto.)’...\r\n\r\n    He is familiar with all the European languages. And by this we\r\n    understand not merely the old classical tongues and the first\r\n    class modern ones; that is to say, the Greek and Latin, the\r\n    Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German and English; his\r\n    knowledge embraces also the languages of the second class, viz.\r\n    the Dutch, the Polish, Bohemian or Czechish, and Servian, the\r\n    Hungarian, and Turkish; and even those of the third and fourth\r\n    class—the Irish, Welsh, Albanian, Wallachian, Bulgarian, and\r\n    Illyrian—are equally at his command. On my happening to mention\r\n    that I had once dabbled a little in Basque, he at once proposed\r\n    that we should set about it together. Even the Romani of the\r\n    Alps, and the Lettish, are not unfamiliar to him; nay, he has\r\n    made himself acquainted with Lappish, the language of the\r\n    wretched nomadic tribes of Lapland; although he told me he did\r\n    not know whether it should be called Lappish or Laplandish.\r\n    He is master of all the languages which are classed under the\r\n    Indo-German family—the Sanscrit and Persian, the Koordish, the\r\n    Armenian, and the Georgian; he is familiar with all the members\r\n    of the Semitic family, the Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, Samaritan,\r\n    Chaldee, Sabaic, and even the Chinese, which he not only reads\r\n    but speaks. As regards Africa, he knows the Coptic, Ethiopic,\r\n    Abyssinian, Amharic, and Angolese.”\r\n\r\nGörres adds what I have already mentioned, as a characteristic mark of\r\ntheir affectionate gratitude, that forty-three of his Propaganda scholars\r\nwaited upon him on occasion of his promotion to the Cardinalate, and\r\naddressed to him a series of congratulations, each in his native dialect.\r\nHe fully bears out too, the assurance which has been repeated over and\r\nover again by every one who had really enjoyed the intimacy of the\r\nCardinal, that, frequently as he came before the public in circumstances\r\nwhich seemed to savour of display, and freely as he contributed to the\r\namusement of his visitors by exhibiting in conversation with them his\r\nextraordinary acquirements, he was entirely free from that vanity to\r\nwhich Madame Paget thinks proper to ascribe it all.\r\n\r\n“With all his high qualifications,” says the Rev. Ingraham Kip,[517] a\r\nclergyman of the American episcopal church, “there is a modesty about\r\nCardinal Mezzofanti which shrinks from anything like praise.” “It would\r\nbe a cruel misconception of his character,” says Guido Görres, “to\r\nimagine that, with all the admiration and all the wonder of which he\r\nhabitually saw himself the object, he yet prided himself in the least\r\nupon this extraordinary gift. ‘Alas!’ he once said to a friend of mine,\r\na good simple priest, who, sharing in the universal curiosity to see\r\nthis wonderful celebrity, apologized to the Cardinal for his visit by\r\nsome compliment upon his European reputation:—‘alas! what will all these\r\nlanguages avail me for the kingdom of heaven, since it is by works, not\r\nwords, that we must win our way thither!’”\r\n\r\nIn truth Cardinal Mezzofanti possessed in an eminent degree the great\r\nsafeguard of christian humility—a habitual consciousness of what he\r\n_was not_, rather than a self-complacent recollection of what he was.\r\nHe used to speak freely of his acquirement as one of little value, and\r\none especially for which he himself had little merit—a mere physical\r\nendowment—a thing of instinct, and almost of routine. God, he said, had\r\ngifted him with a good memory and a quick ear. There lay the secret of\r\nhis success—“What am I,” he would pleasantly say, “but an ill-bound\r\ndictionary!” “He used to disparage his gifts to me,” says Cardinal\r\nWiseman; “and he once quoted a saying ascribed to Catherine de Medici,\r\nwho when told that Scaliger knew twenty languages, observed, ‘that is\r\ntwenty words for one idea! For my part I would rather have twenty ideas\r\nfor one word!’” On one occasion, after the publication of Cardinal\r\nWiseman’s _Horæ Syriacæ_, Mezzofanti said to him: “You have put your\r\nknowledge of languages to some purpose. When I go, I shall not leave\r\na trace of what I know behind me!” And when his friend suggested that\r\nit was not yet too late, he “shook his head and said it was”—which he\r\nalso repeated to Guido Görres, earnestly expressing his “regret that his\r\nyouth had fallen upon a time when languages were not studied from that\r\nscientific point of view from which they are now regarded.” In a word,\r\nthe habitual tendency of his mind in reference to himself, and to his own\r\nacquirements, was to depreciate them, and to dwell rather upon his own\r\ndeficiency and short-comings, than upon his success.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, while he was always ready to gratify the learned interest,\r\nor even to amuse the lighter curiosity, with which his extraordinary\r\ntalent was regarded, there was as little thought of himself in the\r\nperformance, and as little idea of display, as though he were engaged in\r\nan ordinary animated conversation. It was to him an exciting agreeable\r\nexercise and nothing more. He engaged in it for its own sake. To him\r\nit was as natural to talk in a foreign language as it would be to\r\nanother to sing, to relate a lively anecdote, or to take part in an\r\ninteresting discussion. To his humble and guileless mind the notion of\r\nexhibition never presented itself. He retained to his latest hour and\r\nthrough all the successive steps of his advancement, the simplicity and\r\nlightheartedness of boyhood. It was impossible to spend half an hour in\r\nhis company without feeling the literal truth of what he himself said to\r\nGörres regarding his relations to the pupils of the Propaganda;—that he\r\nwent among them not as a Cardinal, but as a school-boy, (_giovanetto_.)\r\nWhat Madame Paget puts down to the account of “small vanity,” was in\r\nreality the result of these almost boyish spirits, and of this simple\r\nand unaffected good nature. He delighted in amusing and giving pleasure;\r\nhe was always ready to display his extraordinary gifts, partly for the\r\ngratification of others, partly because it was to himself an innocent and\r\namusing relaxation: but, among the various impulses to which he yielded,\r\nunquestionably the idea of display was the last that occurred to him as\r\na motive of action. I can say, from my own observation, that never in\r\nthe most distinguished circle, did he give himself to those linguistic\r\nexercises with half the spirit which he evinced among his humble friends,\r\nthe obscure and almost nameless students of the Propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n[1841-1843.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough my own recollections of Cardinal Mezzofanti, in comparison with\r\nthose which have already been laid before the reader, are so few and\r\nunimportant that I hesitated at one time as to the propriety of alluding\r\nto them, I feel that I should be very forgetful of the kindness which I\r\nexperienced at all times at his hands, were I to withhold the impressions\r\nof his character as well as of his gifts, which I received from my\r\nintercourse with him.\r\n\r\nI saw Cardinal Mezzofanti for the first time, in July, 1841. He was then\r\nin his sixty-seventh year: but, although his look and colour betrayed\r\nthe delicacy of his constitution, his carriage, as yet, exhibited little\r\nindication of the feebleness of approaching age. He was below the middle\r\nstature, and altogether of a diminutive, though light, and in youth most\r\nactive frame. His shoulders, it is true, were slightly rounded, and\r\nhis chest had an appearance of contraction; but his movements were yet\r\nfree, tolerably vigorous, and, although perhaps too hurried for dignity,\r\nnot ungraceful. His hair was plentifully dashed with gray; but, except\r\non the crown, where the baldness was but partially concealed by the\r\nred _zucchetto_, (skull cap,) it was still thick and almost luxuriant.\r\nMore than one portrait of him has been published, and several of those\r\nwho saw him at different times have recorded their impressions of his\r\nappearance: but I cannot say that any of these portraitures, whether of\r\npencil or of pen, conveys a full idea of the man. His countenance was\r\none of those which Madame Dudevant strangely, but yet significantly,\r\ndescribes as “not a face, but a physiognomy.” Its character lay far less\r\nin the features than in the expression. The former, taken separately,\r\nwere unattractive, and even insignificant. The proportions of the face\r\nwere far from regular. The complexion was dead and colourless, and these\r\ndefects were made still more remarkable by a small mole upon one cheek.\r\nThere was an occasional nervous winking of the eyelids, too, which\r\nproduced an air of weakness, and at times even of constraint; but there\r\nwas, nevertheless, a pervading expression of gentleness, simplicity, and\r\nopen-hearted candour, which carried off all these individual defects,\r\nand which no portrait could adequately embody. Mr. Monckton Milnes\r\ntold me that the best likeness of the Cardinal he ever saw, was the\r\nkneeling figure in Raffaelle’s noble picture, the Madonna di Foligno:\r\nand undoubtedly, without any close affinity of lineament, it has a\r\nstrong general similitude of air and expression:—the same “open brow of\r\nundisturbed humanity,” on which no passion had written a single line, and\r\nwhich care had touched only to soften and spiritualize; the same quiet\r\nsmile, playful, yet subdued, humility blended with self-respect, modesty\r\nunmarred by shyness or timidity;—above all the same\r\n\r\n    Eyes beaming courtesy and mild regard—\r\n\r\nradiant with a sweetness which I have seldom seen equalled; singularly\r\nsoft and winning, and possessing that undefined power which is the\r\ntrue beauty of an honest eye—a full and earnest, but not scrutinizing\r\nlook—deep, but tranquil, and placing you entirely at ease with yourself\r\nby assuring you of its own perfect calmness and self-possession. But\r\nthe great charm of Cardinal Mezzofanti’s countenance was the look of\r\npurity and innocence which it always wore. I have seldom seen a face\r\nwhich retained in old age so much of the simple expression of youth,\r\nI had almost said of childhood; although, with all this gaiety and\r\nlight-heartedness, there was a gentle gravity in his bearing which kept\r\nit in perfect harmony with his years and character. He had acquired,\r\nor he possessed from nature, the rare and difficult characteristic of\r\ncheerful old age, to which Rochefoucault alludes when he says:—_Peu\r\nde gens savent être vieux_. And thus he was equally at home among\r\nhis venerable peers of the Consistory, and in the youngest and most\r\nlight-hearted _camerata_ of the Propaganda. No old man ever illustrated\r\nmore clearly that\r\n\r\n    The heart—the heart, is the heritage\r\n    Which keepeth the old man young!\r\n\r\nDuring a sojourn of some weeks in Rome, in the summer of 1841, I had the\r\nhonour of conversing with his eminence several times; at the Propaganda;\r\nat the Roman Seminary; at a meeting of the Accademia della Religione\r\nCattolica; and more than once in his own apartments. In the course of one\r\nof these interviews I heard him speak in several languages, to different\r\nacquaintances whom he met, and with each of whom he conversed in his own\r\ntongue—English, German, French, Spanish, Romaic, and Hungarian. With\r\nmyself his conversation was always in English.\r\n\r\nHis English, as we have seen, has been variously judged. Herr Fleck\r\ndescribes it as “only middling:” by others it is pronounced to be\r\nundistinguishable from that of a native. The truth, as in all such cases,\r\nlies between these extremes.\r\n\r\nAll visitors, with the single exception of Herr Fleck, (certainly a very\r\nquestionable authority,) concur in admitting at least the perfect fluency\r\nand strict grammatical accuracy of the Cardinal’s English conversation:\r\nbut some have hesitated as to its idiomatical propriety. M. Crawford,\r\nex-secretary of the Ionian Islands, told M. d’Abbadie[518] last year,\r\nthat Mezzofanti appeared to him to use some un-English constructions. To\r\nDean Milman, who was introduced to him several years ago by Mr. Francis\r\nHare, his English appeared “as if learned from books, grammatical,\r\nrather than idiomatical.”[519] And Lady Morgan even determines the period\r\nof English literature on which his English appeared to be modelled.[520]\r\n\r\nI cannot fully concur, nevertheless, in this opinion. My own impressions\r\nof the Cardinal’s English, derived from many conversations on different\r\noccasions, agree with those already quoted from Mr. Stewart Rose, Lady\r\nBlessington, Mr. Harford, Bishop Baines, Cardinal Wiseman, and others,\r\nwho attest his perfect accuracy both of grammar and of idiom. Mr.\r\nBadeley, the eminent lawyer, who saw him but one year before his death,\r\ntold me that “he spoke English in a perfectly easy and natural manner;”\r\nand Mr. Kip, whose visit was about the same time, declares that, “in\r\nthe course of a long conversation which he held with the Cardinal, his\r\neminence did not use a single expression or word in any way that was not\r\nstrictly and idiomatically correct.” It is true that I should hardly\r\nhave been deceived as to his being a foreigner; but the slight, though\r\nto my ear decisive, foreign characteristics of his English, were rather\r\nof accent than of language; or, if they regarded language at all, it was\r\nnot that his expressions were unidiomatical, or that his vocabulary was\r\nwanting in propriety, but merely that his sentences were occasionally\r\nmore formal—more like the periods of a regular oratorical composition\r\nthan is common in the freedom of every-day conversation. Nor did the\r\npeculiarity of accent to which I refer amount to anything like absolute\r\nimpropriety. His pronunciation was most exact; his accentuation almost\r\nunerring; and, although it certainly could be distinguished from that of\r\na born Englishman, the difference lay chiefly in its being more marked,\r\nand in its precision being more evidently the result of effort and of\r\nrule, than the unstudied and instinctive enunciation of a native speaking\r\nhis own language. If I were disposed to criticize it very strictly,\r\nI might say (paradoxical as this may seem,) that, _compared with the\r\nenunciation of a native_, it was almost _too correct to appear completely\r\nnatural_; and that its very correctness gave to it some slight tendency\r\nto that extreme which the Italians themselves, in reference to their own\r\nlanguage in the mouth of a stranger, describe as _caricato_. But I have\r\nno hesitation in saying, that I never met any foreigner, not resident in\r\nEngland, whose English conversation could be preferred to Mezzofanti’s.\r\nThe foreign peculiarity was, in my judgment, so slight as to be barely\r\nperceptible, and I have myself known more than one instance similar to\r\nthat already related from Cardinal Wiseman, in which Irish visitors\r\nmeeting the Cardinal for the first time, without knowing who he was,\r\ntook him _for an English dignitary_,[521] mistaking the slight trace of\r\nforeign peculiarity which I have described for what is called in Ireland,\r\n“the English accent.”\r\n\r\nIndeed with what care he had attended to the niceties of English\r\npronunciation—the great stumbling block of all foreign students of\r\nthe language—may be inferred from his familiarity with the peculiar\r\ncharacteristics, even of the provincial dialects. It will be recollected\r\nhow he had amused Mr. Harford in 1817, by his specimens of the Yorkshire\r\nand the _Zummer_setshire dialects, and how successfully he imitated\r\nfor Mr. Walsh the slang of a London cabman. And a still more amusing\r\nexample of the minuteness of his knowledge of these dialects has been\r\ncommunicated to me by Rev. Mr. Grant of Lytham, brother of my friend the\r\nBishop of Southwark, to whose unfailing kindness I am indebted for this\r\nand for many other most interesting particulars regarding the Cardinal.\r\nMr. Grant was presented to his eminence in the Spring of 1841, by the\r\nRev. Father Kelleher, an Irish Carmelite, of which order the Cardinal\r\nwas Protector. After some preliminaries the conversation turned upon the\r\nEnglish language.\r\n\r\n    “‘You have many patois in the English language,’ said the\r\n    Cardinal. ‘For instance, the Lancashire dialect is very\r\n    different from that spoken by the Cockneys; [he used this\r\n    word;—] so much so, that some Londoners would find considerable\r\n    difficulty in understanding what a Lancashire man said. The\r\n    Cockneys always use _v_ instead of _w_, and _w_ instead of\r\n    _v_: so that they say ‘vine’ instead of ‘wine;’ [he gave\r\n    this example.] And then the Irish _brogue_, as it is called,\r\n    is another variety. I remember very distinctly having a\r\n    conversation with an Irish gentleman whom I met soon after\r\n    the peace, and he always mis-pronounced that word, calling it\r\n    ‘_pace_.’’\r\n\r\n    Here, F. Kelleher broke out into a horse-laugh, and, slapping\r\n    his hand upon his thigh, cried out, ‘Oh! excèllent! your\r\n    Eminence, excèllent!’ ‘Now, there you are wrong,’ said\r\n    Mezzofanti: ‘you ought not to say excèllent, but èxcellent.’\r\n\r\n    Then he went off into a disquisition on the word ‘great,’\r\n    contending that, according to all analogy, it should be\r\n    pronounced like ‘gr_ee_t’—for that the diphthong _ea_ is so\r\n    pronounced in almost all, if not in _every_ word, in which it\r\n    occurs; and he instanced these words:—‘_eagle_, _meat_, _beat_,\r\n    _fear_,’ and some others. And he said Lord Chesterfield thought\r\n    the same, and considered it a vulgarism to pronounce it like\r\n    ‘grate.’ He next spoke about the Welsh language—but I really\r\n    quite forget what he said: I only remember that the impression\r\n    left on me was that he knew Welsh also.”\r\n\r\nAs to the extent of his acquaintance with English literature, my own\r\npersonal knowledge is very limited. His only allusion to the subject\r\nwhich I recollect, was a question which he put to me about the completion\r\nof Moore’s History of Ireland. He expressed a strong feeling of regret\r\nthat we had not some Irish History, as learned, as impartial, and as\r\nadmirable in its style, as Lingard’s History of England.\r\n\r\nThis is a point, however, on which we have the concurring testimony of\r\na number of English visitors, extending over a period of nearly thirty\r\nyears. The report of Mr. Harford in 1817, has been already quoted; Dr.\r\nCox of Southampton, spoke with high admiration of the Cardinal’s powers\r\nas an English critic. Cardinal Wiseman assures me that “he often heard\r\nhim speaking on English style, and criticizing our writers with great\r\njustness and accuracy. He certainly,” adds the Cardinal, “knew the\r\nlanguage and its literature far better than many an English gentleman.”\r\nWith Mr. Henry Grattan, then (in the year 1843,) member of Parliament\r\nfor Meath, he held a long conversation on the English language and\r\nliterature, especially its poets.\r\n\r\n    “He spoke in English,” says Mr. Grattan, “and with great\r\n    rapidity. He talked of Milton, Pope, Gray, and Chaucer. Milton,\r\n    he observed, was our English Homer, but he was formed by the\r\n    study of Dante, and of the Prophets. On Gray’s Elegy, and on\r\n    Moore’s Melodies, he dwelt with great delight; of the latter he\r\n    repeated some passages, and admired them extremely. Chaucer, he\r\n    said, was taken from Boccaccio. He added that Milton, besides\r\n    his merit as an English poet, also wrote very pretty Italian\r\n    poetry. Talking of French literature, he said that, properly\r\n    speaking, the French have no poetry: ‘they have too much poetry\r\n    in their prose,’ said he, ‘and besides they want the heart that\r\n    is necessary for genuine poetry.’”\r\n\r\nBut the most extraordinary example of Mezzofanti’s minute acquaintance\r\nwith English literature that I have heard, has been communicated to me by\r\nMr. Badeley, who found him quite familiar with an author so little read,\r\neven by Englishmen, as Hudibras!\r\n\r\n    “The Cardinal,” says Mr. Badeley, “received me most graciously;\r\n    his first question was, ‘Well, what language shall we talk?’\r\n    I said, ‘Your eminence’s English is doubtless far better than\r\n    my Italian, and therefore we had better speak English.’ He\r\n    accordingly spoke English to me, in the most easy and natural\r\n    manner, and the conversation soon turned upon the English\r\n    language, and upon English literature; and his reference to\r\n    some of our principal authors, such as Milton, and others of\r\n    that class, shewed me that he was well acquainted with them.\r\n    We talked of translations, and I mentioned that the most\r\n    extraordinary translation I had ever seen was that of Hudibras\r\n    in French. He quite started with astonishment. ‘Hudibras in\r\n    French! impossible—it cannot be!’ I assured him that it was\r\n    so, and that I had the book. ‘But how is it possible,’ said\r\n    he, ‘to translate such a book? The rhymes, the wit, the jokes,\r\n    are the material points of the work—and it is impossible to\r\n    translate these—you cannot give _them_ in French!’ I told\r\n    him that, strange as it might seem, they were very admirably\r\n    preserved in the translation, the measure and versification\r\n    being the same, and the point and spirit of the original\r\n    maintained with the utmost fidelity. He seemed quite lost\r\n    in wonder, and almost incredulous—repeating several times,\r\n    ‘Hudibras in French! Hudibras in French! Most extraordinary—I\r\n    never heard of such a thing!’ During the rest of our interview,\r\n    he broke out occasionally with the same exclamations; and, as\r\n    I took leave, he again asked me about the book. I said that\r\n    it was rather scarce, as it had been published many years\r\n    ago;[522] but, that I had a copy, which I should be happy\r\n    to send him, if he would do me the honour of accepting it.\r\n    Unfortunately, on my return to England, before I could find\r\n    anybody to take charge of it for him, he died.”\r\n\r\nThe very capacity to appreciate “the rhymes, the wit, the jokes,” of\r\nHudibras, in itself implies no common mastery of English. How few even\r\namong learned Englishmen, could similarly appreciate Berni, Pulci,\r\nScarron, or Gresset, not to speak of the minor humourists of France or\r\nItaly!\r\n\r\nIn all this, however, I have been anticipating. My own conversations\r\nwith him, during my first visit to Rome, had but little reference to\r\nlanguages or to any kindred subject. He questioned me chiefly about our\r\ncollege, about the general condition of the Church in Ireland, and the\r\nrelations of religious parties in Ireland and England. My sojourn in Rome\r\noccurred at a time of great religious excitement in the latter country.\r\nThe Tractarian Movement had reached its highest point of interest. The\r\nsecessions from the ranks of Anglicanism had already become so numerous\r\nas to attract the attention of foreign churches. The strong assertion\r\nof catholic principles brought out by the Hampden Controversy; the\r\nsteady advance in tone which the successive issues of the Tracts for\r\nthe Times, and still more of the “British Critic,” had exhibited; above\r\nall, the almost complete identification in doctrine with the decrees of\r\nthe Council of Trent, avowed in the celebrated Tract 90; had created\r\neverywhere a confident hope that many and extensive changes were imminent\r\nin England: and there were not a few among the best informed foreign\r\nCatholics, who were enthusiastic in their anticipation of the approaching\r\nreconciliation of that country with the Church. It was almost exclusively\r\non this topic that Cardinal Mezzofanti spoke during my several interviews\r\nwith him, in 1841. He was already well informed as to the general\r\nprogress of the movement; but he enquired anxiously about individuals,\r\nand especially about the authors of the Tracts for the Times. I was much\r\nstruck by the extent and the accuracy of his information on the subject,\r\nas well as by the justice of his views. He was well acquainted with the\r\nrelations of the High and Low Church parties and with their history.\r\n\r\n“Rest assured,” he one day said to me, “that it is to individual\r\nconversions you are to look in England. There will be no general\r\napproximation of the Churches. This is not the first time these\r\nprinciples have been popular for a while in the English Church. It was\r\nthe same at the time of Laud, and again in the time of the Catholic King,\r\nJames II. But no general movement followed. Many individuals became\r\nCatholics; but the mass of the public still remained Protestant, and were\r\neven more violent afterwards.”\r\n\r\nMore than once during the many outbursts of fanaticism, which we have\r\nsince that time witnessed in England, I have called to mind this wise and\r\nfar-seeing prediction.\r\n\r\nBut, although the Cardinal did not partake in the anticipation, which\r\nsome indulged, of a general movement of the English Church towards\r\nRome, his interest in the conversion of individuals was most anxious\r\nand animated. It was his favourite subject of conversation with English\r\nvisitors at this period. Mr. Grattan has kindly permitted me to copy from\r\nhis journal an account of one of his interviews with the Cardinal, (a few\r\nmonths after this date) which describes a half serious, half jocular,\r\nattempt on the part of his Eminence to convert him from Protestantism.\r\nMrs. Grattan, who is a Catholic, was present during the interview.\r\n\r\nHaving referred, in the course of a very interesting discussion on\r\nEnglish literature, which the reader has already seen, to Sir Thomas\r\nMore, as the earliest model of English prose, the Cardinal observed that\r\nMore was a truly great and good man.\r\n\r\n    “‘He made an enemy of his King,’ said he, ‘but he made a\r\n    friend in his God.’ He then inquired of Mrs. Grattan, how it\r\n    happened that I had not changed my religion, and become a\r\n    Catholic—‘Now-a-days,’ said he, ‘there is no penalty and no\r\n    shame attached to the step; on the contrary, a great party in\r\n    England esteem you the more for it, and many learned men of\r\n    your own day have set you the example. You have, besides, the\r\n    venerable Bede; you have St. Patrick, too—both the greatest of\r\n    your countrymen in their age; you have King Alfred, and the\r\n    Edwards, all inviting you to the Church.’ He then approached\r\n    me in the most affectionate manner, took my hand and pressed\r\n    it, with a mixture of tenderness, drollery, and good nature.\r\n    ‘Now you _must_ change,’ he continued. ‘You will not be able to\r\n    escape it; your religion is but three hundred years old: the\r\n    Catholic dates from the beginning of Christianity. It is the\r\n    religion of Christ; its head on earth is the Pope—not, as yours\r\n    once was, an old woman, but the Pope!’ Here he became quite\r\n    animated, took Mrs. Grattan’s hand, and drew her over, holding\r\n    each of us by the hand; his manner became most fervent, his old\r\n    eye glistened, he looked up to Heaven, and exclaimed,—‘There\r\n    is the place to make a friend!’ Then turning to me, he said,\r\n    ‘Ireland is the garden of religion, and you must one day become\r\n    a flower in it.’”\r\n\r\nMr. Grattan was deeply affected by this remarkable interview; and I may\r\nadd that I have known few Protestant visitors of the Cardinal, who did\r\nnot carry away the most favourable impressions regarding him. With all\r\nthe earnestness and fervour of his own religious convictions, he was\r\nsingularly tolerant and forbearing towards the followers of another\r\ncreed. “His gentleness and modesty,” writes Chevalier (now Baron)\r\nBunsen, “have often struck me. Once, some misrepresentations of Lady\r\nMorgan in her book on Italy, being mentioned in his presence with strong\r\nvituperation, he gently interposed. ‘Poor Lady Morgan!’ said he; ‘it is\r\nnot yet given to her to see truth.’”\r\n\r\nBut although in my conversations with the Cardinal in 1841, his Eminence\r\nconfined himself entirely to English, yet on one occasion, at the close\r\nof a meeting of the Accademia della Cattolica Religione, I heard him\r\nconverse, with every appearance of fluency and ease, in six different\r\nlanguages with the various members of a group who collected around him;\r\nin Romaic with Monsignor Missir, a Greek Archbishop; in German with\r\nGuido Görres; in Magyar with a Hungarian artist who accompanied him; in\r\nFrench with the Abbé La Croix, of the French church of St. Lewis; in\r\nSpanish with a young Spanish Dominican; and in English with myself and my\r\ncompanions. It was only however, during a second and more prolonged visit\r\nto Rome in the first six months of 1843, that I was witness, in its full\r\nreality, of the marvellous gift of which I had read and heard so much.\r\n\r\nI was fortunate enough to arrive on Rome in the vigil of the great\r\nannual “Academy” of the Propaganda, which, from immemorial time has\r\nbeen held during the octave of the Epiphany, the special festival of\r\nthat institution. It is hardly necessary, in speaking of an exercise\r\nnow so celebrated, to explain that this Academy consists of a series of\r\nbrief addresses and recitations, generally speaking in a metrical form,\r\ndelivered by the students in all the various languages which happen\r\nat the time to be represented in the college. The subjects of these\r\ncompositions are commonly drawn from the festival itself, or from some\r\nkindred theme; and the rapidity with which they succeed each other,\r\nand the earnestness and vigour with which most of them are delivered,\r\ncreate an impression which hardly any other conceivable exhibition\r\ncould produce. To the audience, of course, the greater number of these\r\nrecitations are an unknown sound; but the earnest manner of the speakers;\r\ntheir foreign and unwonted intonations; the curious variety of feature\r\nand expression which they present; and the unique character of the whole\r\nproceeding—gave to the scene an interest entirely independent of the\r\nrecitations themselves considered as literary compositions.\r\n\r\nI never shall forget the impression which I received at my first entrance\r\nat the _Aula Maxima_[523] on the evening of Sunday, January 8th, 1843.\r\nAt the farther end of the hall, on an elevated platform, the benches\r\nof which rose above each other like the seats of a theatre, sat the\r\nassembled pupils, arranged with some view to effect, in the order in\r\nwhich they were to take part in the exercise. They seemed of all ages,\r\nfrom the dawn of youth to mature manhood. It would be difficult to find\r\nelsewhere collected together so many specimens of the minor varieties of\r\nthe human race. Gazing upon the eager faces crowded within that little\r\nspace, one might almost persuade himself that he had the whole world in\r\nminiature before him, with all its motley tribes and races—\r\n\r\n    Che comprender non può prosa ne vérso:—\r\n    Da India, dal Catai, Marrocco, e Spagna.\r\n\r\nSome of the varieties, and perhaps those which present the most marked\r\nphysiological contrasts with the rest, it is true, were wanting; but\r\nall the more delicate shades of difference were clearly discernable;\r\nthe familiar lineaments of the Celtic and Anglo-Saxon race; all the\r\nwell-known European types of feature and complexion; the endless though\r\nhighly contrasted varieties of Asiatic and North African form—the classic\r\nIndian, the stately Armenian, the calm and impassive Chaldee, the solemn\r\nSyrian, the fiery Arab, the crafty Egyptian, the swarthy Abyssinian, the\r\nstunted Birman, the stolid Chinese. And yet in all, far as they seemed\r\nasunder in sentient and intelligent qualities, might be traced the common\r\ninterest of the occasion. Each appeared to feel that this—the feast of\r\nthe illumination of the Gentiles—was indeed his own peculiar festival.\r\nAll were lighted up by the excitement of the approaching exercise; and\r\nit was impossible, looking upon them, and recalling the object which had\r\nbrought them all together from their distant homes, not to give glory to\r\nGod for this, the most glorious work of his church: in which “Parthians,\r\nand Medes, and Elamites, and the inhabitants of Mesopotamia, Judea, and\r\nCappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts\r\nof Lybia about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews also, and proselytes,\r\nCretes and Arabians, speak the wonderful works of God;”—not, as of old,\r\nin one tongue, but each in the tongue of his own people.\r\n\r\nBelow the platform were arrayed the auditory. The front seats,\r\ndistinguished by their red drapery, were reserved for the Cardinals, of\r\nwhom several were present,—Franzoni, the Cardinal Prefect, with his pale\r\nand passionless face—the very ideal of self-denying spirituality;—the\r\nEnglish Cardinal Acton, shrinking, as it seemed, from the notice which\r\nhis prominent position drew upon him—Castracane, Cardinal Penitentiary,\r\nwith the look of earnest and settled purpose which he always wore;—the\r\nlively little Cardinal Massimo,[524] in animated and evidently pleasant\r\nconversation, with two of the Professors, the lamented abate Palma\r\nand abate Graziosi;—the classic head of Mai, every feature instinct\r\nwith intellectuality—every look bespeaking the scholar and the priest.\r\nBut it need scarcely be said, that on this evening, despite his scant\r\nproportions and unimposing presence, every other claimant for notice was\r\nforgotten in comparison with the true hero of such a scene—the great\r\npolyglot Cardinal Mezzofanti. He was seated on the extreme right of the\r\nfront rank, and, as I entered, was conversing eagerly with a stately\r\nlooking Greek bishop, Monsignor Missir, whose towering stature and\r\nsingularly noble head contrasted strongly with the diminutive and almost\r\ninsignificant figure of the great linguist.\r\n\r\nBehind the Cardinals sate a number of foreign bishops, prelates, members\r\nof religious orders, and other distinguished strangers, many of them\r\nevidently orientals. The general assembly at the back included most\r\nof the literary foreigners then in Rome, among whom were more than one\r\nEnglish clergyman, at that time the object of many an anxious prayer and\r\naspiration, of which we have since been permitted to witness the happy\r\nfulfilment in their accession to the fold of the Church.\r\n\r\nThe exercises of the evening, besides a Latin proem and an epilogue in\r\nItalian, comprised forty-eight recitations on “the Illumination of the\r\nGentiles;” but, as these included several varieties of Latin and Italian\r\nversification, the total number of languages represented in the Academy\r\nwas only forty-two. The Latin proem was delivered by a young Irish\r\nstudent from the centre of the platform; the other speakers delivering\r\ntheir parts from the places assigned to them by the programme. Most of\r\nthe languages were spoken by natives of the several countries where they\r\nprevail; and, where no native representative could be found, a student\r\nremarkable for his proficiency in the language was selected instead.\r\nIt thus happened that the Hebrew psalm was recited by a Dutchman; the\r\nSpanish ode fell to a native of Stockholm; and the soft measures of the\r\nItalian _terzine_ and anacreontics were committed to the tender mercies\r\nof two youths from beyond the Tweed!\r\n\r\nWith those of the odes which I was in some degree able to follow, the\r\nLatin, Italian, French, Spanish, and German, I was much pleased. They\r\nappeared to me remarkably simple, elegant, and in good taste. But for the\r\nrest, it would be idle to attempt to convey an idea of the strange effect\r\nproduced by the rapid succession of unknown sounds, uttered with every\r\ndiversity of intonation,[525] accompanied by every variety of gesture,\r\nand running through every interval in the musical scale, from “syllables\r\nwhich breathe of the soft south,” to the\r\n\r\n    Harsh northern whistling, grunting, guttural,\r\n    That we’re obliged to hiss, and spit, and sputter all.\r\n\r\nSome of the recitations were singularly soft and harmonious; some\r\ncame, even upon an uninstructed ear, with a force and dignity, almost\r\nindependent of the sense which they conveyed; some on the contrary,\r\nespecially when taken in connexion with the gestures and intonation of\r\nthe reciter, were indescribably ludicrous. Among the former was the\r\nSyriac ode, recited by Joseph Churi, a youth since known in English\r\nliterature. Among the latter, the most curious were a Chinese Eclogue,\r\nand a Peguan Dialogue. The speakers in both cases were natives, and I\r\nwas assured by a gentleman who was present at the exercise, and who\r\nhad visited China more than once, that their recitation was a perfect\r\nreproduction of the tone and manner of the native theatre of China.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire proceedings Cardinal Mezzofanti was a most\r\nattentive, and evidently an anxious listener. Every one of the young\r\naspirants to public favour was personally and familiarly known to\r\nhim. Many of the pieces, moreover, upon these occasions, were his own\r\ncomposition, or at least revised by him; and thus, besides his paternal\r\nanxiety for the success of his young friends, he generally had somewhat\r\nof the interest of an author in the literary part of the performance. It\r\nwas plain, too, that, for the young speakers themselves, his Eminence\r\nwas, in his turn, the principal object of consideration; and it was\r\namusing to observe, in the case of one of the oriental recitations,\r\nthat the speaker almost appeared to forget the presence of the general\r\nauditory, and to address himself entirely to the spot where Cardinal\r\nMezzofanti sate.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the exercises, as soon as the interesting assemblage\r\nof the platform broke up, a motley group was speedily formed around\r\nthe good-natured Cardinal, to hear his criticisms, or to receive his\r\ncongratulations on the performance; and I then was witness for the first\r\ntime of what I saw on more than one subsequent occasion—the almost\r\ninconceivable versatility of his wonderful faculty, and his power of\r\nflying from language to language with the rapidity of thought itself,\r\nas he was addressed in each in succession;—hardly ever hesitating, or\r\never confounding a word or interchanging a construction. Most of the\r\nmembers of the polyglot group which thus crowded around him and plied\r\nhim with this linguistic fusilade, were of course unknown to me; but I\r\nparticularly noticed among the busiest of the questioners, the Chinese\r\nyouths who had taken part in their native eclogue, and a strange,\r\nmercurial, monkey-like, but evidently most intelligent lad, whom I\r\nafterwards recognized as one of the speakers in the Peguan Dialogue.[526]\r\nI was gratified, too, to see a gap which I had observed in the programme\r\nof the exercises—the omission of the Russian language—supplied by his\r\nEminence in this curious after-performance. A Russian gentleman, who\r\nhad sate near me during the evening, now joined the group assembled\r\naround the Cardinal, and good-humouredly complained of the oversight.\r\nHis Eminence, without a moment’s thought, replied to him in Russian;—in\r\nwhich language a lengthened conversation ensued between them, with every\r\nevidence of ease and fluency on the part of the Cardinal. Although I have\r\nnever since learned the name of this traveller, I noted the circumstance\r\nwith peculiar interest at the time, because he had already established\r\na claim upon my remembrance, by selecting (without knowing me as an\r\nIrishman,) among all the recitations of the evening, as especially\r\nharmonious and expressive in its sounds, the _Irish Ode_; which had been\r\ndelivered with great character and effect by a young student of the\r\nCounty Mayo.\r\n\r\nDuring my first visit to Rome, I had heard a great deal of this curious\r\npower of maintaining a conversation simultaneously with several\r\nindividuals, and in many different languages; but I was far from being\r\nprepared for an exhibition of it so wonderful as that which I have\r\nwitnessed. I cannot, at this distance of time, say what was the exact\r\nnumber of the group which stood around him, nor can I assert that they\r\nall spoke different languages; but making every deduction, the number\r\nof speakers cannot have been less than ten or twelve; and I do not\r\nthink that he once hesitated for a sentence or even for a word! Many\r\nvery wonderful examples of the power of dividing the attention between\r\ndifferent objects have been recorded. Julius Cæsar, if we believe Pliny,\r\nwas able to listen with his ears, read with his eyes, write with his\r\npen, and dictate with his lips, at the same time. Mordaunt, Earl of\r\nPeterborough, often dictated to six or seven secretaries simultaneously.\r\nWalter Scott, when engaged in his Life of Napoleon, used to dictate\r\nfluently to his amanuensis, while he was, at the same time, taking down\r\nand reading books, consulting papers, and comparing authorities on the\r\ndifficult points of the history which were to follow. The wonderful\r\npowers of the same kind possessed by Phillidor, the chess-player, too,\r\nare well known.[527] But I cannot think that there is any example of\r\nthe faculty of mental self-multiplication, if it can be thus called,\r\nupon record, so wonderful as that exhibited by Mezzofanti in these, so\r\nto speak, linguistic tournaments, in which he held the lists against all\r\nopponents, not successively, but at once. Guido Görres, describing the\r\nrapidity of his transitions from one language to another, compares it\r\nto “a bird flitting from spray to spray.” The learned Armenian, Father\r\nArsenius, speaking of the perfect distinctness of his use of each, and\r\nof the entire absence of confusion or intermixture, says his change from\r\nlanguage to language “was like passing from one room into another.”\r\n“Mezzofanti himself told me,” writes Cardinal Wiseman, “that whenever he\r\nbegan to speak in one tongue, or turned into it from another, he seemed\r\nto forget all other languages except that one. He has illustrated to me\r\nthe difficulty he had to encounter in these transitions, by taking a\r\ncommon word, such as ‘bread,’ and giving it in several cognate languages,\r\nas Russian, Polish, Bohemian, Hungarian, &c., the differences being very\r\nslight, and difficult to remember. Yet he never made the least mistake in\r\nany of them.”\r\n\r\nWhen Rev. John Strain, now of St. Andrew’s, Dumfries, who assures me\r\nthat, while he was in the Propaganda, he often heard Mezzofanti speak\r\nseven or eight languages in the course of half an hour, asked him how it\r\nwas that he never jumbled or confused them. Mezzofanti laughingly asked\r\nin his turn.\r\n\r\n“Have you ever _tried on a pair of green spectacles_?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied his companion.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mezzofanti, “while you wore these spectacles everything\r\nwas green to your eyes. It is precisely so with me. While I am speaking\r\nany language, for instance, Russian, _I put on my Russian spectacles_,\r\nand for the time, _they colour everything Russian_. I see all my ideas\r\nin that language alone. If I pass to another language, _I have only to\r\nchange the spectacles, and it is the same for that language also_!”\r\n\r\nThis amusing illustration perfectly describes the phenomenon so far\r\nas it fell under observation; but, so far as I am aware, no one has\r\nattempted to analyse the mental operation by which these astounding\r\nexternal effects were produced. The faculty, whatever it was, may have\r\nbeen improved and sharpened by exercise; but there is no part of the\r\nextraordinary gift of this great linguist so clearly exceptional, and so\r\nunprecedented in the history of the faculty of language.\r\n\r\nA few weeks after the Propaganda academy, I met his Eminence at the\r\nlevee of the newly created Cardinal Cadolini, ex-Secretary of the Sacred\r\nCongregation. Recognizing me at once as “the Maynooth Professor,” he\r\naddressed me laughingly in Irish: _Cion̄us tá tú_ “How are you?” It has\r\nrepeatedly been stated that he knew Irish; and that language is actually\r\nenumerated in more than one published list of the languages which he\r\nspoke. Had it not been for his own candour on the occasion in question, I\r\nmyself should have carried away the same impression from our interview.\r\nBut on my declaring my inability to enter into an Irish conversation,\r\nhe at once confessed that, had I been able to go farther, I should have\r\nfound himself at fault; as, although he knew so much as enabled him to\r\ninitiate a conversation, and to make his way through a book, he had not\r\nformally studied the Irish language. Nevertheless that he was acquainted\r\nwith its general characteristics, and the leading principles of its\r\ninflections and grammatical structure, its analogies with Gælic, as well\r\nas their leading points of difference, and its general relations with\r\nthe common Celtic family, I was enabled to ascertain in a subsequent\r\ninterview, in which I was accompanied by an accomplished Irish scholar,\r\nthe late Rev. Dr. Murphy of Kinsale. Dr. Murphy was much struck with the\r\naccuracy and soundness of his views.\r\n\r\nOne of the observations which he made during this interview was\r\nafterwards the occasion of no little amusement to us. During an audience\r\nwhich Dr. Murphy, accompanied by Dr. Cullen, then Rector of the Irish\r\nCollege, had had a few days before with the Pope, Gregory XVI., a new\r\nwork of Sir William Betham, _Etruria Celtica_—in which an attempt is made\r\nto establish the identity of the Irish and Etrurian languages, and in\r\nwhich the celebrated Eugubian inscriptions are explained as Irish,—had\r\nbeen presented to the Pope. His holiness, who was much interested in\r\nEtruscan antiquities, on hearing from Dr. Cullen the nature and object\r\nof the work, had expressed great amusement at this latest discovery in a\r\nmatter which had already been explained in at least a dozen different and\r\nconflicting ways. We mentioned this to the Cardinal.\r\n\r\n“His Holiness is perfectly right,”he replied. “There is no possible\r\nmeaning which could not be taken out of it, if you only grant the licence\r\nwhich these antiquarians claim. The Eugubian tables, in different\r\nsystems,[528] have been explained by some as a calendar of Festivals; by\r\nothers as a code of laws; by others as a system of agricultural precepts.\r\nIt is no wonder that your Irish author explains them as Irish. But I\r\nwill venture to say that, if you only take any common Italian or Latin\r\nsentence, and apply to it the same system of interpretation, you may\r\nexplain it as Irish, and find it make excellent sense.”\r\n\r\nOn leaving his Eminence, we resolved to put his suggestion to the test.\r\nWe took the first sentence in the first of F. Segneri’s sermons which\r\nopened in the volume. I have since tried, but in vain, to find the\r\npassage: and I only recollect about it, that it related to the ardent\r\ndesire of our Divine Lord, that the light of his gospel should shine\r\namong men. Dr. Murphy, without exceeding in the slightest degree the\r\nlicense which Sir W. Betham allows himself, in dealing with the Eugubian\r\ninscriptions, converted this Italian sentence into an Irish one, which,\r\nto our infinite amusement, literally rendered, ran as follows: “In\r\nsailing into the harbour, they came to the place of his habitation; and\r\n_they took a vast quantity of large specked trouts, by the great virtue\r\nof white Irish fishing-rods_!”\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal repeated to Dr. Murphy during this visit what he had before\r\nsaid, that he did not pretend to speak Irish, but added that, if he had a\r\nlittle practice, he would easily acquire it. I had already heard the same\r\nfrom the Archbishop of Tuam, who knew him on his first arrival in Rome. I\r\nhave since been told that, in the following winter, he formally addressed\r\nhimself to the study, with the assistance of the late Rev. Dr. Lyons of\r\nErris, who was then in Rome; but I have no means of testing the truth of\r\nthe statement, or of ascertaining the extent of his progress.\r\n\r\nThis discussion regarding the Irish language naturally suggested a\r\nsimilar inquiry as to the Cardinal’s knowledge of the kindred Gælic.\r\nThe Rev. John Strain, who knew him in 1832, when he first came to Rome,\r\ninforms me that in that year he had no knowledge whatever of the Gælic\r\nlanguage. He got a friend of Mr. Strain’s to repeat some sentences in it\r\nfor him, and expressed a wish to procure some books for the purpose of\r\nlearning it. I find from the catalogue of his library that he did procure\r\na few Gælic books: and Rev. John Gray of Glasgow, who was a student of\r\nthe Propaganda till the year 1841, informs me that he at that time knew\r\nthe language, but spoke it very imperfectly.[529]\r\n\r\nAn American gentleman whom I met one day in the Cardinal’s ante-chamber,\r\nshowed me an impromptu English couplet which his eminence had just\r\nwritten for him, on his asking for some memorial of their interview. I\r\nam not able now to recall this distich to memory; but it is only one of\r\nnumberless similar tokens which the Cardinal presented to his visitors\r\nand friends. One of his favourite amusements consisted in improvising\r\nlittle scraps of verse in various languages, for the most part embodying\r\nsome pious or moral sentiment, which he flung off with the rapidity of\r\nthought, and without the slightest effort. Few of those which I have\r\nseen, indeed, can be said to exhibit much poetical genius. There is\r\nbut little trace of imagination in them, and the sentiments, though\r\nexcellent, are generally commonplace enough. But while, considered as a\r\ntest of command over the languages in which they are written, even the\r\nmost worthless of them cannot be regarded as insignificant, there are\r\nmany of them which are very prettily turned, and display no common power\r\nof versification.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to recover scraps like these, fragmentary of their own\r\nnature, and scattered over every country of the earth. I have sought in\r\nvain for oriental specimens, although the Cardinal distributed numbers\r\nof them to the students of the Propaganda at their leaving college. In\r\na sheet of autographs prefixed to this volume will be found verses in\r\nsixteen different languages. A few others are given in the appendix.\r\nI shall jot down here two or three specimens of his classical epigrams\r\nwhich have fallen in my way.\r\n\r\nMost of them arose out of the very circumstance of his being asked for\r\nsuch a token of remembrance.\r\n\r\nFor instance, on one occasion when the request was addressed to him _in\r\nGreek_, he wrote:\r\n\r\n    Ἑλλάδος ἠρώτας ἐμε ῥήμασιν. Ἑλλάδος ἁυδήν\r\n    Ἐκχὲω, οὐδ’ ἄλλην χρή ἀπαμειβόμενον.\r\n    Οὐ φθόγγος φθόγγοισιν ἀμείβεται, εί μὴ ὁμοῖος,\r\n    Ἀλλ’ ἀπὸ συμφώνων γίγνεται ἁρμονίη.\r\n    Νῦν δέ τίνα Γνώμην δώσω ἀιτοῦντι; τιν ἄλλην\r\n    Ἡ—— ’Θεὸν ἐν πάσῃ, δὲι φιλέειν κραδίῃ.’\r\n\r\nSo again, when a visitor begged him to write _his name_ in an album, he\r\ngave, instead, this pretty couplet.\r\n\r\n    Pauca dedi—nomen. Tu sane pauca petisti,\r\n    Assiduus sed ego te rogo plura—preces.\r\n\r\nIn answer to a similar request at another time, he replied—\r\n\r\n    Accipe quod poscis—nomen. Scribatur ut ipsum\r\n    In cœlo, ad Dominum tu bone funde preces.\r\n\r\nOn being presented on New Year’s day with a pair of spectacles by his\r\nfriend, Dr. Peter Trombetti, of Bologna, he wrote:—\r\n\r\n    Deficit heu acies oculorum! instante senecta;\r\n    Deficit;—at comis lumina tu duplicas.\r\n    Lumen utrumque mihi argento dum nocte coruscat\r\n    Haud mihi qui dederit decidet ex animo.\r\n\r\nA similar present at the next New Year elicited the following:—\r\n\r\n    Cum vix sufficiunt oculi mihi nocte legenti,\r\n    Ecce bonus rursum lumina tu geminas.\r\n    Prospera ut eveniant multis volventibus annis,\r\n    Cuncta tibi, par est me geminare preces.\r\n\r\nTo another of his Bolognese friends, the Canonico Tartaglia, now rector\r\nof the Pontifical seminary, who begged some memorial, he sent the\r\nfollowing pretty epigram:—\r\n\r\n    Sæpe ego versiculos heic dicto, stans pede in uno;\r\n    Carmina sed fingo nulla linenda cedro.\r\n    Qualiacumque cano velox heu dissipat aura!\r\n    Unum de innumeris hoc mihi vix superest,\r\n    Mittimus hoc unum interea. Exiguum accipe donum\r\n    Eternæ veteris pignus amicitiæ.\r\n\r\nAny one who has ever tried to turn a verse in any foreign tongue, will\r\nagree with me in regarding the rapidity with which these trifles were\r\nwritten, as one of the most curious evidences of the writer’s mastery\r\nover the many languages in which he is known to have indulged this fancy.\r\nThe really pretty Dutch verses—verses as graceful in sentiment as they\r\nare elegant in language—in reply to Dr. Wap’s address, were penned in Dr.\r\nWap’s presence and with great rapidity. Father Legrelle’s Flemish verses\r\nwere dashed off with equal quickness. The American of whom I spoke told\r\nme that the Cardinal wrote almost without a moment’s thought. It was the\r\nsame for the lady mentioned by Dr. Wap, although the subject of these\r\nverses arose during the interview; and even the Persian stanza which he\r\nwrote for Dr. Tholuck, and which “contained several pretty ἐνθυμήσεις,”\r\ncost him only about half an hour! How many of those who consider\r\nthemselves most perfect in French, Italian, or German, have ever ventured\r\neven upon a single line of poetry in any of them?\r\n\r\nI must not omit another circumstance which I myself observed, and which\r\nstruck me forcibly as illustrating the singular nicety of his ear, and\r\nstill more the completeness with which he threw himself into all the\r\ndetails of every language which he cultivated;—I mean his manner and\r\naccent in pronouncing Latin in conversation with natives of different\r\ncountries. One day I was speaking to him in company with Guido Görres,\r\nwhen he had occasion to quote to me Horace’s line.\r\n\r\n    Si paulum a summo decessit, vergit ad imum:—\r\n\r\nwhich he pronounced quite as I should have pronounced it, and without\r\nany of the peculiarities of Italian pronunciation. He turned at once to\r\nGörres, and added—\r\n\r\n“Or, as you would say:\r\n\r\n    Si _pow_lum a _soomm_o _det_sessit, ver_ghit_ ad imum,”\r\n\r\nintroducing into it every single characteristic of the German manner\r\nof pronouncing the Latin language. I have heard the same from other\r\nforeigners. It was amusing, too, to observe that he had taken the\r\ntrouble to note and to acquire the peculiar expletive or interjectional\r\nsounds, with which, as it is well known, natives of different countries\r\nunconsciously interlard their conversation, and the absence or misuse\r\nof which will sometimes serve to discover the foreign origin of one who\r\nseems to speak a language with every refinement of correctness.[530] The\r\nEnglishman’s “ah!” the Frenchman’s “oh!” the whistling interjection of\r\nthe Neapolitan, the grunt of the Turk, the Spaniard’s nasal twang—were\r\nall at his command.\r\n\r\nMy brief and casual intercourse with the Cardinal would not entitle me to\r\nspeak of his character and disposition, were it not that my impressions\r\nare but an echo of all that has been said and written before me, of his\r\ncheerful courtesy, his open-hearted frankness, and his unaffected good\r\nnature. To all his visitors of whatever degree, he was the same—gay,\r\namiable, and unreserved. With him humility was an instinct. It seemed\r\nas though he never thought of himself, or of any claim of his to\r\nconsideration. He would hardly permit the simple mark of respect—the\r\nkissing of the ring which ordinarily accompanies the salutation of one of\r\nhigh ecclesiastical dignity in Italy; and his demeanour was so entirely\r\ndevoid of assumption of superiority that the humblest visitor was at once\r\nmade to feel at home in his company.\r\n\r\nHis conversation was uniformly gay and cheerful, and no man entered\r\nmore heartily into the spirit of any little pleasantry which might\r\narise. On one occasion, upon a melting summer day, as he was shewing the\r\nmagnificent Giulio Clovio Dante, in the Vatican library, to a well-known\r\nLondon clergyman, the latter, in his delight at one of the beautiful\r\nminiatures by which it is illustrated—a moonlight scene—was in the act of\r\npointing out _with his moist finger_ some particular beauty which struck\r\nhim, when Mezzofanti, horror-struck at the danger, caught his arm.\r\n\r\n“Softly, my dear Doctor,” he playfully interposed: “these things may be\r\nlooked at with the eyes, but not with the fingers.”\r\n\r\nHe delighted, too, in puns, and was equally ready in all languages. He\r\nlaughed heartily at Cardinal Rivarola’s Italian pun against himself,\r\nabout the _orecchini_;[531] and one day, while he was speaking German\r\nwith Guido Görres, the latter having made some allusion to his\r\nEminence’s increasing gray hairs, and spoken of him as a _weiss-haar_\r\n(white-haired,)\r\n\r\n“Ach!” he replied with a gentle smile, not untinged with\r\nmelancholy;—“ach! gäbe Gott dass ich, wie _weiss-haar_, so auch _weiser_\r\ngeworden wäre.”[532]\r\n\r\nIt will easily be inferred from this, that, among etymologies, he was\r\nespecially attracted by those which involved a play upon words:—if they\r\nadmitted a pun so much the better. He was much amused by Herr Fleck’s\r\nsuggestion, that the name Mezzofanti, was derived from Ἑν μέσῳ φαίνεται;\r\nand Cardinal Wiseman told me that once, after learnedly canvassing the\r\nvarious etymologies suggested for Felsina, the ancient name of his\r\nnative city, Bologna, he laughingly brought the discussion to a close by\r\nsuggesting that probably it was _Fé l’asina_, (the ass made it.)\r\n\r\nProbably it was to this taste he was indebted for that familiarity with\r\nHudibras—a writer, otherwise so unattractive to a foreigner—which took\r\nMr. Badeley by surprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n[1843-1849.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the honours and occupations of his new dignity, Cardinal\r\nMezzofanti sustained a severe affliction in the death of his favourite\r\nnephew, Monsignor Minarelli—the _Giuseppino_ (Joe) so often commemorated\r\nin his early correspondence. This amiable and learned ecclesiastic\r\ninstead of accompanying his uncle to Rome, where the most brilliant\r\nprospects were open to him, preferred to pursue the quiet and useful\r\ncareer of university life, in which he had hitherto been associated with\r\nhim in Bologna. By successive steps, he had risen to the Rectorate of\r\nthe University; and in recognition of his services to that institution,\r\nthe honorary dignity of a prelate of the first class in the Roman\r\nCourt—popularly styled _del mantelletto_—had been conferred on him by the\r\nPope. The Cardinal, as is plain from his own letters and those of his\r\nBologna friends, was warmly attached to him. While he lived in Bologna\r\nGiuseppe was his friend and companion, rather than his pupil; and the\r\nyoung man’s early death was felt the more deeply by him, from the\r\ncongeniality of tastes and studies which had always subsisted between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal’s sister, Teresa, (mother of the deceased prelate,) although\r\nshe was ten years his senior, was still living in their old home at\r\nBologna, and he continued to correspond with her up to the time of his\r\ndeath. His letters to her are all exceedingly simple and unaffected—so\r\nentirely of a domestic character, and without public interest, that, if\r\nI translate one of them here—the latest which has come into my hands—it\r\nis merely as a specimen of the warmth and tenderness, as well as deeply\r\nreligious character of the Cardinal’s affection for his sister and for\r\nher children.\r\n\r\n    “We are on the eve of your Saint’s Day, my dearest sister. I am\r\n    to say Mass on that day in the Church of the Servites; but I\r\n    shall offer it for you, praying with all the fervor of my heart\r\n    that God may long preserve you in health, and console you under\r\n    your affliction, and that your holy patroness may protect you,\r\n    and obtain for you all the graces of which you stand in need.\r\n    I wish to mark the occasion by a little token of my affection,\r\n    and I have already written to Gesnalde to transmit it to you.\r\n    It is a mere trifle, but I know that you will only look, as\r\n    you have always done in past years, to the person it comes\r\n    from, and that you will give it value by accepting it, and by\r\n    corresponding with me in recommending me, as I do you, to the\r\n    special favour of the Almighty. As being my elder sister, you\r\n    used always, when we were children, to pray for your little\r\n    brother; and I know that you still continue the practice; I am\r\n    most grateful for it, and I try to make you every return.\r\n\r\n    Your sons, and my niece Anna unite with me in their\r\n    affectionate wishes, and beg your blessing. May God bestow his\r\n    most abundant blessings on you!”\r\n\r\nThe history of the later years of the Cardinal’s life presents scarcely\r\nany incidents of any special interest. Few of the reports of the\r\nforeigners who met him at this period, differ in any material particulars\r\nfrom those which we have already seen. I shall content myself, therefore,\r\nwith two or three of them, which may be taken as specimens of the entire,\r\nbut which are selected also with a view to serve in guiding the reader\r\nin his estimate, not merely of the general attainments of the Cardinal\r\nas a linguist, but of his proficiency in the languages of the writers\r\nthemselves, and in other languages, not specially commemorated hitherto.\r\n\r\nWe have already passingly alluded to the account of Mezzofanti given\r\nby the Rev. Ingraham Kip, a clergyman of the Episcopalian Church in\r\nAmerica: but the details into which this gentleman enters, regarding\r\nhis Eminence’s knowledge of the English language and literature, are so\r\nimportant, that it would be unpardonable to pass them by.\r\n\r\n    “He is a small lively looking man,” says Mr. Kip, “apparently\r\n    over seventy. He speaks English with a slight foreign\r\n    accent—yet remarkably correct. Indeed, I never before met with\r\n    a foreigner who could talk for ten minutes without using some\r\n    word with a shade of meaning not exactly right; yet, in the\r\n    _long conversation I had with the Cardinal, I detected nothing\r\n    like this. He did not use a single expression or word in any\r\n    way which was not strictly and idiomatically correct._ He\r\n    converses, too, without the slightest hesitation, never being\r\n    at the least loss for the proper phrase.\r\n\r\n    In talking about him some time before to an ecclesiastic, I\r\n    quoted Lady Blessington’s remark, ‘that she did not believe he\r\n    had made much progress in the literature of these forty-two\r\n    languages; but was rather like a man who spent his time in\r\n    manufacturing keys to palaces which he had not time to enter;’\r\n    and I inquired whether this was true. ‘Try him,’ said he,\r\n    laughing; and, having now the opportunity, I endeavoured to do\r\n    so. I led him, therefore, to talk of Lord Byron and his works,\r\n    and then of English literature generally. He gave me, in the\r\n    course of his conversation, quite a discussion on the subject\r\n    which was the golden period of the English language; and of\r\n    course fixed on the days of Addison. He drew a comparison\r\n    between the characteristics of the French, Italian, and Spanish\r\n    languages; spoke of Lockhart’s translation from the Spanish,\r\n    and incidentally referred to various other English writers. He\r\n    then went on to speak of American literature, and paid high\r\n    compliments to the pure style of some of our best writers. He\r\n    expressed an opinion that, with many, it had been evidently\r\n    formed by a careful study of the old authors—those ‘wells of\r\n    English undefiled’—and, that within the last fifty years we had\r\n    imported fewer foreign words than had been done in England. He\r\n    spoke very warmly of the works of Mr. Fennimore Cooper, whose\r\n    name, by the way, is better known on the continent than that of\r\n    any other American author.”\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Kip, unfortunately, was not acquainted with any of the Indian\r\nlanguages of North America, he was unable to test the extent of the\r\nCardinal’s attainments in these languages. His account, nevertheless, is\r\nnot without interest.\r\n\r\n    “In referring to our Indian languages, he remarked, that the\r\n    only one with which he was well acquainted was the Algonquin,\r\n    although he knew something of the Chippewa and Delaware; and\r\n    asked whether I understood Algonquin; I instantly disowned\r\n    any knowledge of the literature of that respectable tribe of\r\n    Savages; for I was afraid the next thing would be a proposal\r\n    that we should continue the conversation in their mellifluous\r\n    tongue. He learned it from an Algonquin missionary, who\r\n    returned to Rome, and lived just long enough to enable the\r\n    Cardinal to begin this study. He had read the works of Mr.\r\n    Du Ponceau[533] of Philadelphia, on the subject of Indian\r\n    languages, and spoke very highly of them.”\r\n\r\nIt is right to add Mr. Kip’s conclusions from the entire interview, and\r\nhis impressions regarding the natural and acquired powers of the great\r\nlinguist.\r\n\r\n    “And yet,” he concludes, “_all this conversation by no\r\n    means satisfied me_ of the depth of the Cardinal’s literary\r\n    acquirements. There was nothing said which gave evidence of\r\n    more than a superficial acquaintance with English literature;\r\n    the kind of knowledge which passes current in society, and\r\n    which is necessarily picked up by one who meets so often\r\n    with cultivated people of each country. His acquirements in\r\n    words are certainly wonderful; but I could not help asking\r\n    myself their use. I have never yet heard of their being of\r\n    any practical benefit to the world during the long life of\r\n    their possessor. He has never displayed anything philosophical\r\n    in his character of mind; none of that power of combination\r\n    which enables Schlegel to excel in all questions of philology,\r\n    and gives him a talent for discriminating and a power of\r\n    handling the resources of a language which have never been\r\n    surpassed.”[534]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reader will be disposed to regard Mr. Kip’s criticism as\r\nsomewhat _exigeant_ in its character; and to think that, even taking his\r\nown report of his conversation with the Cardinal, and of the number and\r\nvariety of the English and American writers, with whom, and with whose\r\npeculiar characteristics, he was acquainted—some of them, moreover—as\r\nfor example, Lockhart’s Spanish Ballads—a translation from a foreign\r\nlanguage—most unlikely to attract a “superficial” foreigner, he was a\r\nlittle unreasonable in refusing “to be satisfied with the depth of the\r\nCardinal’s literary acquirements.” For my part, I cannot help thinking\r\nthis interview, even as recorded by Mr. Kip, one of the most astonishing\r\nincidents in the entire history of this extraordinary man. And I may add\r\nto what is here stated of his familiarity with the principal English\r\nauthors, native and American, that, as I am informed by the Rev. Mr.\r\nGray, of Glasgow, the Cardinal was also intimately acquainted with the\r\nnational literature of Scotland; that he had read many of the works of\r\nWalter Scott and Burns; and that he understood and was able to enjoy the\r\nLowland Scottish dialect, which is one of the great charms of both.\r\n\r\nMr. Kip’s impressions as to the Cardinal’s want of skill in the science\r\nof language and of its philosophical bearing on history and ethnology,\r\nmust be admitted to have more foundation, and are shared by several of\r\nthe scholars who visited him, especially those who cultivated ethnology\r\nas a particular study. I have reserved for this place a short notice of\r\nthe Cardinal, which has been communicated to me by Baron Bunsen, and\r\nwhich, while it does ample justice to Mezzofanti’s merits as a linguist,\r\nputs a very low estimate on his accomplishments as a philologer, and a\r\ncritic. The reader will gather from much of what has been already said,\r\nthat I am far from adopting this estimate in several of its particulars;\r\nbut Baron Bunsen’s opinion upon any question of scholarship or criticism\r\nis too important to be overlooked.\r\n\r\n    “I saw him first as Abate and Librarian at Bologna, in 1828,\r\n    when travelling through Italy, with the Crown Prince (now\r\n    King) of Prussia. When he came to Rome as head librarian to\r\n    the Vatican, I have frequently had the pleasure of seeing\r\n    him in my house, and in the Vatican. He was always amiable,\r\n    humane, courteous, and spoke with equal fluency the different\r\n    languages of Europe. His gentleness and modesty have often\r\n    struck me. Once, when some misrepresentations of Lady Morgan\r\n    in her book on Italy, were mentioned before him with very\r\n    strong vituperation, ‘Poor Lady Morgan!’ he said, ‘it is not\r\n    yet given to her to see truth.’ When complimented by an English\r\n    lady upon his miraculous facility in acquiring languages, with\r\n    the additional observation that Charles the Fifth had said,\r\n    ‘as many languages as a man knows, so many times he is a man,’\r\n    he replied, ‘Well, that ought rather to humble us; for it is\r\n    essential to man to err, and therefore, such a man is the more\r\n    liable to error, if Charles the Fifth’s observation is true.’\r\n\r\n    On the other side, I must confess that I was always struck by\r\n    the observation of an Italian who answered to the question:\r\n    ‘Non è miracoloso di vedere un uomo parlare quaranta due\r\n    lingue?’ replied, ‘Si, senza dubbio; ma più miracoloso ancora\r\n    è di sentire che questo uomo in quaranta due lingue non dice\r\n    _niente_.’ A giant as a linguist, Mezzofanti certainly was a\r\n    child as a philologer and philological critic.\r\n\r\n    He delighted in etymologies, and sometimes he mentioned new\r\n    and striking ones, particularly as to the Romanic languages\r\n    and their dialects. But he could not draw any philosophical\r\n    or historical consequences from that circumstance, beyond the\r\n    first self-evident elements. He had no idea of philosophical\r\n    grammar. I have once seen his attempt at decyphering a Greek\r\n    inscription, and never was there such a failure. Nor has he\r\n    left or published anything worth notice.\r\n\r\n    I explain this by his ignorance of all _realities_. He\r\n    remembered words and their sounds and significations almost\r\n    instinctively; but he lived upon reminiscences: he never had\r\n    an original thought. I understood from one of his learned\r\n    colleagues, (a Roman Prelate,) that it was the same with his\r\n    theology; there was no acuteness in his divinity, although he\r\n    knew well St. Thomas and other scholastics.\r\n\r\n    As to Biblical Criticism, he had no idea of it. His knowledge\r\n    of Greek criticism too was very shallow.\r\n\r\n    In short, his linguistic talent was that of seizing sounds and\r\n    accents, and the whole (so to say) idiom of a language, and\r\n    reproducing them by a wonderful, but equally special, memory.\r\n\r\n    I do not think he had ever his equal in this respect.\r\n\r\n    But the cultivation of this power had absorbed all the rest.\r\n\r\n    Let it, however, never be forgotten that he was, according to\r\n    all I have heard from him, a charitable, kind Christian, devout\r\n    but not intolerant, and that his habitual meekness was not a\r\n    cloak, but a real Christian habit and virtue. Honour be to his\r\n    memory.”\r\n\r\nThere is a part of this criticism which is unquestionably just: but\r\nthere are also several of the views from which I am bound to dissent\r\nmost strongly, and to which I shall have occasion to revert hereafter.\r\nMeanwhile, that the Cardinal paid more attention to these inquiries than\r\nMr. Kip and M. Bunsen suppose, will appear from the testimony of the Abbé\r\nGaume, author of the interesting work, “_Les Trois Rome_.”\r\n\r\n    “I had often met the illustrious philologer,” says M. Gaume,\r\n    “at the Propaganda, where he used to come to spend the\r\n    afternoon. Kind, affable, modest, he mixed with the students,\r\n    and spoke by turns Arabic, Turkish, Armenian, Chinese, and\r\n    twenty other languages, with a facility almost prodigious.\r\n    When I entered, I found him studying Bas-Breton, and I have\r\n    no doubt that in a short time he will be able to exhibit it\r\n    to the inhabitants of Vannes themselves. His eminence assured\r\n    me of two points. The first is the fundamental unity of all\r\n    languages. This unity is observable especially in the parts of\r\n    speech, which are the same or nearly so in all languages. The\r\n    second is the trinity of dialects in the primitive language;—a\r\n    trinity corresponding with the three races of mankind. The\r\n    Cardinal has satisfied himself that there are but three races\r\n    sprung from one common stock, as there are but three languages\r\n    or principal dialects of one primitive language;—the Japhetic\r\n    language and race; the Semitic language and race; and the\r\n    Chamitic language and race. Thus the unity of the human kind\r\n    and the trinity of races, which are established by all the\r\n    monuments of history, are found also to be supported by the\r\n    authority of the most extraordinary philologer that has even\r\n    been known.\r\n\r\n    The Cardinal’s testimony is the more important inasmuch as\r\n    his linguistic acquirements are not confined to a superficial\r\n    knowledge. Of the many languages which he possesses, there is\r\n    not one in which he is not familiar with the every day words,\r\n    common sayings, adages, and all that difficult nomenclature\r\n    which constitutes the popular part of a language. One day\r\n    he asked one of our friends to what province of France he\r\n    belonged. ‘To Burgundy;’ replied my friend. ‘Oh!’ said\r\n    Mezzofanti, ‘you have two Burgundian dialects; which of them do\r\n    you speak?’ ‘I know,’ replied our friend, ‘the patois of Lower\r\n    Burgundy.’ Whereupon the Cardinal began to talk to him in Lower\r\n    Burgundian, with a fluency which the vine-dressers of Nantes or\r\n    Beaune might envy.”[535]\r\n\r\nThis curious familiarity with provincial _patois_, described by the\r\nAbbé Gaume, extended to the other provincial dialects of France. M.\r\nManavit found him not only acquainted with the Tolosan dialect, but\r\neven not unread in its local literature. His library contains books in\r\nthe dialects of Lorraine, Bearne, Franche Comté, and Dauphiné. I have\r\nalready mentioned his speaking Provençal with Madame de Chaussegros;\r\nand Dr. Grant, bishop of Southwark, told me that he was able, solely by\r\nthe accent of the Abbé Carbry, to determine the precise place of his\r\nnativity, Montauban.\r\n\r\nAnother language regarding which, although it has more than once been\r\nalluded to, few testimonies have as yet been brought forward, is Spanish.\r\nI shall content myself, nevertheless, with the evidence of a single\r\nSpaniard, which, brief as it is, leaves nothing to be desired. “I can\r\nassert of his Eminence,” writes Father Diego Burrueco, a Trinitarian\r\nof Zamora, who knew the Cardinal during many of these years, “that he\r\nspoke our Spanish like a native of Castile. He could converse in the\r\nAndalusian dialect with Andalusians; he was able, also, to distinguish\r\nthe Catalonian dialect from that of Valencia, and both from that of the\r\nIsland of Majorca.”[536] We have already seen that, at a very early\r\nperiod of his life, he studied the Mexican, Peruvian, and other languages\r\nof Spanish America. That he spoke both Mexican and Peruvian after he\r\ncame to Rome, Cardinal Wiseman has no doubt. He is also stated to have\r\nlearned something of the languages of Oceanica from Bishop Pompalier,\r\nof New Zealand. I may add here, though I have failed in finding native\r\nwitnesses, that it is the universal belief in Rome that he spoke well\r\nboth ancient and modern Chaldee, and ancient Coptic, as also the modern\r\ndialect of Egypt. He had the repute also of being thoroughly familiar\r\nwith both branches of the Illyrian family—the Slavonic and the Romanic.\r\nTo the testimonies already borne to his skill in Armenian and Turkish,\r\nI must add that of the Mechitarist, Father Raphael Trenz, Superior of\r\nthe Armenian College in Paris, who knew him in 1846. “Having conversed\r\nwith his Eminence,” writes this father,[537] “in ancient and in modern\r\nArmenian, and also in Turkish, I am able to attest that he spoke and\r\npronounced them all with the purity and propriety of a native of these\r\ncountries.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps also, although we have had many notices of his skill in Russian\r\nand Polish from a very early period, it may be satisfactory to subjoin\r\nthe reports of one or two travellers who conversed with him in these\r\nlanguages during his latter years.\r\n\r\nTo begin with Russian. A traveller of that nation who twice visited him\r\nabout this time, cited by Mr. Watts, describes him as “a phenomenon as\r\nyet unparalleled in the literary world, and one that will scarce be\r\nrepeated, unless the gift of tongues be given anew, as at the dawn of\r\nChristianity.”\r\n\r\n    “Cardinal Mezzofanti,” he writes, “spoke eight languages\r\n    fluently in my presence: he expressed himself in Russian\r\n    very purely and correctly; but, as he is more accustomed to\r\n    the style of books than that of ordinary discourse, it is\r\n    necessary to use the language of books in talking with him for\r\n    the conversation to flow freely. His passion for acquiring\r\n    languages is so great, that even now, in advanced age, he\r\n    continues to study fresh dialects. He learned Chinese not long\r\n    ago; and is constantly visiting the Propaganda for practice in\r\n    conversation with its pupils of all sorts of races. I asked\r\n    him to give me a list of all the languages and dialects in\r\n    which he was able to express himself, and he sent me the name\r\n    of GOD written in his own hand, in fifty-six languages, of\r\n    which thirty were European, not counting their subdivision of\r\n    dialects, seventeen Asiatic, also without reckoning dialects,\r\n    five African, and four American. In his person, the confusion\r\n    that arose at the building of Babel is annihilated, and all\r\n    nations, according to the sublime expression of Scriptures,\r\n    are again of one tongue. Will posterity ever see anything\r\n    similar? Mezzofanti is one of the most wonderful curiosities of\r\n    Rome.”[538]\r\n\r\nIn the end of the year 1845, Nicholas, the late Emperor of Russia, (who\r\nof course is an authority also on the Polish language,) came to Rome, on\r\nhis return from Naples, where he had been visiting his invalid Empress.\r\nThe history of his interview with the Pope, Gregory XVI., and of the\r\napostolic courage and candour with which, in two successive conferences,\r\nthat great pontiff laid before him the cruelty, injustice, and impolicy\r\nof his treatment of the Catholic subjects of his empire, is too well\r\nknown to need repetition here.[539] It was commonly said at the time,\r\nand has been repeated in more than one publication, that the Pope’s\r\ninterpreter in this memorable conference was Cardinal Mezzofanti. This is\r\na mistake. The only Cardinal present at the interview was the mild and\r\nretiring, but truly noble-minded and apostolic, Cardinal Acton.\r\n\r\nA few days, however, after this interview, M. Boutanieff, the Russian\r\nminister at Rome, wrote to request that Cardinal Mezzofanti would wait\r\nupon the Emperor; and a still more direct invitation was conveyed to\r\nhim, in the name of the Emperor himself, by his first aide-de-camp. The\r\nCardinal of course could not hesitate to comply. Their conversation was\r\nheld both in Russian and in Polish. The Emperor was filled with wonder,\r\nand confessed that, in either of these languages it would be difficult\r\nto discover any trace of foreign peculiarity in the Cardinal’s accent or\r\nmanner.[540] It is somewhat amusing to add, that the Cardinal is said to\r\nhave taken some exceptions to the purity, or at least the elegance, of\r\nthe Emperor’s Polish conversational style.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Polish language, however, the year 1845 supplies other and\r\nmore direct testimonies than that of the Emperor Nicholas.\r\n\r\nIn an extract cited by Mr. Watts from the Posthumous Works of the eminent\r\nPolish authoress, Klementyna z Tanskich Hoffmanowa, who visited Rome in\r\nthe March of that year, it is stated that “the cardinal spoke Polish\r\nwell, though with somewhat strained and far-fetched expressions;” and\r\nthat he was master of the great difficulty of Polish pronunciation—that\r\nof the marked _l_—“although he often forgot it.” This lady has preserved\r\nin her Diary a Polish couplet, written for her by the Cardinal with his\r\nown hand, under a little picture of the Madonna.\r\n\r\n    Ten ogien ktory żyia w sercu twoiem\r\n    O Matko Boża! zapal w sercu moiem.[541]\r\n\r\nAnother, and to the Cardinal far more interesting, representative of the\r\nPolish language appeared in Rome during the same year. Mezzofanti had\r\nlong felt deeply the wrongs of his oppressed fellow-Catholics in Poland\r\nand Lithuania. A few months before the Emperor’s arrival in Rome, they\r\nhad been brought most painfully under his eyes by the visit of a refugee\r\nof that vast empire, and a victim of the atrocious policy which had\r\nbecome its ruling spirit—the heroic Makrena Mirazylawski, abbess of the\r\nBasilian convent of Minsk, the capital of the province of that name. The\r\norganized measures of coercion by which the Emperor endeavoured to compel\r\nthe Catholic population of Lithuania and Poland, and the other Catholic\r\nsubjects of the empire, into renunciation of their allegiance to the\r\nHoly See, and conformity with the doctrine and discipline of the Russian\r\nchurch, comprised all the members of the Catholic church in Russia\r\nwithout exception, even the nuns of the various communities throughout\r\ntheir provinces. Among these was a sisterhood of the Basilian order in\r\nthe city of Minsk, thirty-five in number. The bishop of the diocese and\r\nthe chaplain of the convent, having themselves conformed to the imperial\r\nwill, first endeavoured to bend the resolution of these sisters by\r\nblandishment, but in the end sought by open violence to compel them into\r\nsubmission. But the nobleminded sisters, with their abbess at their head,\r\nfirmly refused to yield; and, in the year 1839, the entire community\r\n(with the exception of one who died from grief and terror) were driven\r\nfrom their convent, and marched in chains to Witepsk, and afterwards\r\nto Polosk, where, with two other communities equally firm in their\r\nattachment to their creed, they were subjected, for nearly six years, to\r\na series of cruelties and indignities of which it is difficult to think\r\nwithout horror, and which would revolt all credibility, were they not\r\nattested by authorities far from partial to the monastic institute.[542]\r\nChained hand and foot; flogged; beaten with the fist and with clubs;\r\nthrown to the earth and trampled under foot; compelled to break stones\r\nand to labour at quarries and earthworks; dragged in sacks after a\r\nboat through a lake in the depth of winter; supplied only with the\r\nmost loathsome food and in most insufficient quantity; lodged in cells\r\ncreeping with maggots and with vermin; fed for a time exclusively on salt\r\nherrings, without a drop of water; tried, in a word, by every conceivable\r\ndevice of cruelty;—the perseverance of these heroic women is a living\r\nmiracle of martyr-like fidelity. Nine of the number died from the effects\r\nof the excessive and repeated floggings to which, week after week, they\r\nwere subjected, three fell dead in the course of their cruel tasks; two\r\nwere trampled to death by their drunken guards; three were drowned in\r\nthese brutal _noyades_; nine were killed by the falling of a wall, and\r\nfive were crushed in an excavation, while engaged in the works already\r\nreferred to; eight became blind; two lost their reason; several others\r\nwere maimed and crippled in various ways; so that, in the year 1845,\r\nout of the three united communities (which at the first had numbered\r\nfifty-eight) only four, of whom Makrena was the chief, retained the use\r\nof their limbs! These heroines of faith and endurance contrived at last\r\nto effect their escape from Polosk, from which place it had been resolved\r\nto transport them to Siberia; and, through a thousand difficulties and\r\ndangers, Makrena Mirazylawski made her adventurous way to Rome.\r\n\r\nThe sufferings and the wrongs of this interesting stranger found a ready\r\nsympathy in Cardinal Mezzofanti’s generous heart. He listened to her\r\nnarrative with deep indignation, and took the liveliest interest in all\r\nthe arrangements for her safe and fitting reception and that of her\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nI was naturally anxious to hear what, on the other hand, were the\r\nabbess’s impressions of the cardinal. In reply to the inquiries of my\r\nfriend, Rev. Dr. Morris, she “spoke of him in the very highest terms.”\r\n“He was,” she said, “a living saint,” and she described both his charity\r\nand his spirituality as very remarkable. When Father Ryllo (the Jesuit\r\nRector of the Propaganda before F. Bresciani) left Rome for the African\r\nMission, Cardinal Mezzofanti became Mother Makrena’s director, and\r\ncontinued to be so for two years. “He spoke Polish,” she declares,\r\n“like a native of Poland, and wrote it with great correctness.” Having\r\nascertained that the abbess had had a considerable packet of papers\r\nwritten by him in Polish, generally on those occasions when he could not\r\ncome to her as usual, on various spiritual subjects, I was most anxious\r\nto obtain copies of them; but I was deeply mortified to learn that they\r\nwere all unfortunately lost in the Revolution, when she was driven out\r\nof her little convent near Santa Maria Maggiore. This humble community\r\nwas afterwards increased by the arrival of other fugitives from different\r\nparts of the Russian Empire; nor did the cardinal cease till the very\r\nlast days of his life his anxious care of all their spiritual and\r\ntemporal interests.\r\n\r\nAnother religious institution to which he devoted a good deal of his\r\ntime was the House of Catechumens, of which, as has already been stated,\r\nhe was Cardinal Protector. When M. Manavit was in Rome the inmates of\r\nthis establishment, then in preparation for baptism, were between thirty\r\nand forty, several of whom were Moors or natives of Algeria; and there\r\nare few who will not cordially agree with him[543] in looking upon “the\r\nmodest Cardinal, catechism in hand, in the midst of this humble flock, as\r\na nobler picture, more truly worthy of admiration, than delivering his\r\nmost learned dissertation on the Vedas to the most brilliant company that\r\never assembled in the halls of the Propaganda.”\r\n\r\nIn this, and in more than one other charitable institution of Rome, the\r\nCardinal took especial delight in assisting at the First Communion of the\r\nyoung inmates; and, from the simple fervour of his manner and the genuine\r\ntruthfulness of his piety, he was most happy and effective in the little\r\nhalf hortatory, half ejaculatory discourses, called _Fervorini_, which in\r\nRome ordinarily, on occasions of a First Communion, precede the actual\r\nadministration of the sacrament.\r\n\r\nM. Manavit adds that, even after Mezzofanti became cardinal, his old\r\ncharacter of _Confessario dei Forestieri_ (“Foreigners’ Confessor”) was\r\nby no means a sinecure. To many of the Polish exiles, clergy and laity,\r\nwho visited or settled in Rome, he acted as director, especially after\r\nFather Ryllo’s departure to Africa. He was equally accessible to low and\r\nhigh degree. M. Mouravieff[544] (the Russian traveller already cited)\r\nmentions an instance in which, having heard of a poor servant maid,\r\na young Russian girl, who desired to be received into the Church, he\r\npaid her repeated visits, instructed her in the catechism, and himself\r\ncompleted in person every part of her preparation for the sacraments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe death of Pope Gregory XVI., (June 1st, 1846) which, although in a\r\nripe old age, was at the time entirely unexpected, was a great affliction\r\nto Mezzofanti, whose affectionate relations with him were maintained to\r\nthe very last. The Cardinal was, of course, a member of the conclave\r\nin which (June 16th) Pius IX. was elected. The speedy and unanimous\r\nagreement of the Cardinals in this election—one of the few which seemed\r\nto convert the traditional form of “election by inspiration,” into a\r\nreality—was commemorated impromptu by him in the following graceful\r\nepigram:—\r\n\r\n    Gregorius cœlo invectus sic protinus orat:\r\n    “Heu cito Pastorem da, bone Christe, gregi!”\r\n    Audit; et immissus pervadit pectora Patrum,\r\n    Spiritus: et Nonus prodiitecce Pius![545]\r\n\r\nDuring the pontificate of Gregory XVI., Cardinal Mezzofanti never held\r\nany office of state; nor did the change of sovereign make any change\r\nin his rank or his occupations. He was, of course, continued by the\r\nnew government in all his appointments; and the new Pope, Pius IX.,\r\nregarded him with the same friendship and favour which he had enjoyed\r\nat the hands of his predecessor. In the social and political changes\r\nwhich ensued, Mezzofanti, from his non-political character, had no part.\r\nNo one sympathized more cordially with the beneficent intentions of\r\nhis Sovereign; but, completely shut out as he was by his position from\r\npolitical affairs, he pursued his quiet career, with all its wonted\r\nregularity, through the very hottest excitement of the eventful years of\r\n1847 and 1848.\r\n\r\nMany visitors who conversed with him in these, the last years of his\r\nlife, have repeated to me the accounts which have already become familiar\r\nfrom the reports of those who knew him in earlier years. The fulfilment\r\nof his public duties as Cardinal;—the care of the institutions over which\r\nan especial charge had been assigned him;—the confessional, whenever his\r\nservices were sought by a foreigner;—above all, his beloved pupils in the\r\nPropaganda—these formed for him the business of life.\r\n\r\n    “Almost every evening, when I was in the College of the\r\n    Propaganda,” says F. Bresciani, “he would come to exercise\r\n    himself with these dear pupils, who are collected there from\r\n    all nations of the world, to be educated in sacred and profane\r\n    literature and in the apostolic spirit. Then, as he conversed\r\n    with me in the halls of the Propaganda when the pupils were\r\n    returning from their evening walks, he would go to meet them\r\n    as he saw them coming up the steps, and, as they passed him,\r\n    would say something to them in their own languages; speaking\r\n    to one, Chinese; to another, Armenian; to a third, Greek; to a\r\n    fourth, Bulgarian. This one he would accost in Arabic, that, in\r\n    Ethiopic, Geez, or Abyssinian; now he would speak in Russian,\r\n    then in Albanian, in Persian, in Peguan, in Coptic, in English,\r\n    in Lithuanian, in German, in Danish, in Georgian, in Kurdish,\r\n    in Norwegian, in Swedish. Nor was there ever any risk that he\r\n    should get entangled, or that a word of another language or a\r\n    wrong pronunciation should escape him.”[546]...\r\n\r\n    “Every year, from the time of his coming to Rome, even after\r\n    he had been made Cardinal, he used to assist the students in\r\n    composing their several national odes for the Polyglot Academy\r\n    of the Propaganda, which is held during the octave of the\r\n    Epiphany, and in which the astonished foreigners who witness\r\n    it behold a living emblem of the unity of the Catholic Church,\r\n    which alone is able, through the Holy Spirit that vivifieth\r\n    her, to show forth in one fraternity the union of all tongues,\r\n    in praising and blessing the Lord who created us and redeemed\r\n    us by the blood of Jesus Christ. Now the Cardinal, in these\r\n    fifty tongues and upwards, in which the pupils composed, would\r\n    make all the necessary corrections whether of thought, metre,\r\n    or phrase, with all, and perhaps more than all, the facility\r\n    and exactness of others in writing poetry in their native\r\n    tongue. After he had corrected the compositions, he would\r\n    take his beloved pupils, one by one, and instruct them in the\r\n    proper mode of reciting and pronouncing each. And, as some of\r\n    them occasionally had entered college when very little boys,\r\n    and had forgotten some of the tones or cadence of their native\r\n    languages, he would come to their aid by suggesting these,\r\n    testing and correcting them with the utmost gentleness and\r\n    patience.”[547]\r\n\r\nIt would be out of place here to enter into any detail of the startling\r\nand violent changes by which these tranquil occupations were rudely\r\ninterrupted. The Cardinal had watched with deep anxiety the gradually\r\nincreasing demands with which each successive generous and confiding\r\nmeasure of the administration of Pius IX. had been met; but even his\r\nsagacious mind, schooled as it had already been in the vicissitudes of\r\nformer revolutions, was not prepared for the succession of terrible\r\nevents which crowded themselves into the last few weeks of the “year\r\nof revolution”—the furious demands of the clubs—the expulsion of the\r\nJesuits—the assassination of De Rossi—the obtrusion of a republican\r\nministry—the flight of the Pope—the proclamation of the Republic. Amid\r\nall the terrors of the time, he had but one thought—gratitude for the\r\nsafety of the Pope. He was urged by his friends to imitate the example\r\nof the main body of the Cardinals, and to follow his Sovereign to Gaeta\r\nor Naples; but he refused to leave Rome, and continued through all the\r\nscenes of violence which followed the flight of Pius IX., to live,\r\nwithout any attempt at concealment, at his old quarters in the Palazzo\r\nValentiniani.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, although, personally, Cardinal Mezzofanti suffered no\r\nmolestation, the alarm and anxiety inseparable from such a time, could\r\nnot fail to tell upon a constitution, at no time robust, and of late\r\nyears much enfeebled. From the beginning of the year 1849, his strength\r\nbegan sensibly to diminish. It was characteristic of the man that even\r\nall the terrors of the period could not make him forget his favourite\r\nfestival of the Epiphany; and that, among the numberless more deplorable\r\nchanges which surrounded him, he still had a regret for the absence of\r\nthe accustomed Polyglot Academy of the Propaganda. Before the middle of\r\nJanuary he became so weak, that it was with the utmost difficulty he was\r\nable to say mass in his private chapel. While he was in this state of\r\nextreme debility, he was seized with an alarming attack of pleurisy; and\r\nalthough the acute symptoms were so far relieved at the end of January,\r\nthat his family entertained sanguine hopes of his recovery, this illness\r\nwas followed, in the early part of February, by an attack of gastric\r\nfever, by which the slender remains of his strength were speedily\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\nThe venerable sufferer at once became sensible of his condition. From the\r\nvery first intimation of his danger, he had commenced his preparation\r\nfor death, with all the calm and simple piety which had characterised\r\nhis life. In accordance with one of our beautiful Catholic customs—at\r\nonce most holy in themselves, and an admirable help even to the sublimest\r\npiety—he at once entered upon a _Novena_, or nine days’ devotion, to St.\r\nJoseph; who, as, according to an old tradition, his own eyes were closed\r\nin death by the blessed hands of his divine Saviour, has been adopted\r\nby Catholic usage as the Patron of the Dying, and who was besides the\r\nname-saint and especial Patron of the Cardinal himself. In these pious\r\nexercises he was accompanied by his chaplain, by his nephews, Gaetano and\r\nPietro, and above all, by his niece, Anna, who was most tenderly attached\r\nto him, and was inconsolable at the prospect of his death. He himself\r\nfixed the time for receiving the Holy Viaticum and the Extreme Unction.\r\nThey were administered by Padre Ligi, parish priest of the Church of SS.\r\nApostoli, assisted by the Cardinal’s chaplain, and by his confessor,\r\nPadre Proja, now Sacristan of St. Peter’s. The chaplain and the members\r\nof his family frequently assembled at his bed-side, to accompany and\r\nassist him in his dying devotions; and the intervals between these common\r\nprayers, in which all alike took part, were filled up with pious readings\r\nby Anna Minarelli, and with short prayers of the holy Cardinal himself.\r\n“Dio mio! abbiate pietà di me!” “My God, have mercy on me!”—was his ever\r\nrecurring ejaculation, mingled occasionally with prayers for the exiled\r\nPontiff, for the welfare of his widowed Church, and for the peace of his\r\ndistracted country. “_Abbiate pietà della Chiesa! Preghiamo per lei!_”\r\n\r\nBy degrees he became too feeble to maintain his attention through a\r\nlong prayer; but even still, with that deeply reverent spirit which had\r\nalways distinguished him, he would not suffer the prayer to be abruptly\r\nterminated. “_Terminiamo con un Gloria Patri_,” “Let us finish with a\r\nGloria Patri:”—he would say, when he found himself unable longer to\r\nattend to the Litany of the Dying, or the Rosary of the Blessed Virgin.\r\nBut in a short time he would again summon them to resume their devotion.\r\n\r\nEarly in March it became evident that his end was fast approaching. He\r\nstill retained strength by energy enough to commence a second Novena\r\nto his holy Patron St. Joseph—a pious exercise, which, in the simple\r\nwords of his biographer, “he was destined to bring to an end in heaven.”\r\nDuring the last three days of life, his articulation, at times, was\r\nbarely distinguishable; but even when his words were inaudible, his\r\nattendants could not mistake the unvarying fervour of his look, and the\r\nreverent movements of the lips and eyes, which betokened his unceasing\r\nprayer. From the morning of the 15th of March, the decline of strength\r\nbecame visibly more rapid; and, on the night of that day, he calmly\r\nexpired.[548] His last distinguishable words, a happy augury of his\r\nblessed end—were: “_Andiamo, andiamo, presto in Paradiso._” “_I am\r\ngoing—I am going—soon to Paradise!_”\r\n\r\nThe absence of the Roman Court, as well as the other unhappy\r\ncircumstances of the times, precluded the possibility of performing his\r\nobsequies with the accustomed ceremonial. An offer of the honours of\r\na public funeral, with deputations from the university, and an escort\r\nof the National Guard, was made by M. Gherardi, the Minister of Public\r\nInstruction in the new-born Republic. But these, and all other honours\r\nof the anti-Papal Republic, were declined by his family;—not only from\r\nthe unseemliness of such a ceremonial at such a time, but still more as\r\ninconsistent with the loyalty, and the personal feelings, principles, and\r\ncharacter, of the illustrious deceased.\r\n\r\nWithout a trace, therefore, of the wonted solemnities of a cardinalitial\r\nfuneral—the _cappella ardente_; the lofty catafalque; the solemn lying in\r\nstate; the grand _Missa de Requiem_;—the remains of the great linguist\r\nwere, on the evening of the 17th of March, conducted unostentatiously,\r\nwith no escort but that of his own family and of the members of his\r\nmodest household, bearing torches in their hands, to their last\r\nresting-place in Sant’ Onofrio, on the Janiculum—the church of his\r\nCardinalitial title.\r\n\r\nThere, within the same walls which, as we saw, enclose the ashes of\r\nTorquato Tasso, the tomb of Cardinal Mezzofanti may be recognised by\r\nthe following unpretending inscription, from the pen of his friend Mgr.\r\nLaureani:—\r\n\r\n                      HEIC.

MDCCCXLVIIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n(RECAPITULATION.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now before us, in the narrative of Cardinal Mezzofanti’s life,\r\nsuch materials for an estimate of his attainments as a linguist and a\r\nscholar, as a most diligent and impartial inquiry has enabled me to bring\r\ntogether. I can truly say that in no single instance have I suffered\r\nmy own personal admiration of his extraordinary gifts to shape or to\r\ninfluence that inquiry. I have not looked to secure a verdict by culling\r\nthe evidence. A great name is but tarnished by unmerited praise—_non\r\neget mendacio nostro_. I have felt that I should consult best for the\r\nfame of Mezzofanti, by exhibiting it in its simple truth; and I have\r\nsought information regarding him, fearlessly and honestly, in every\r\nfield in which I saw a prospect of obtaining it,—from persons of every\r\nclass, country, and creed—from friendly, from indifferent, and even from\r\nhostile quarters;—from all, in a word, without exception, whom I knew\r\nor thought likely to possess the means of contributing to the solution\r\nof the interesting problem in the annals of the human mind, which is\r\ninvolved in his history. It only remains to sum up the results. Nor is\r\nit easy to approach this duty with a perfectly unbiassed mind. If, on the\r\none hand, there is a temptation to heighten the marvels of the history,\r\nviewed through what Carlyle calls “the magnifying _camera oscura_ of\r\ntradition,” on the other, there is the opposite danger of unduly yielding\r\nto incredulity, and discarding its genuine facts on the sole ground\r\nof their marvellousness. I shall endeavour to hold a middle course. I\r\nshall not accept any of the wonders related of Mezzofanti, unless they\r\nseem attested by undisputable authority: but neither shall I, in a case\r\nso clearly abnormal as his, and one in which all ordinary laws are so\r\ncompletely at fault, reject well-attested facts, because they may seem\r\nirreconcilable with every-day experience. Our judgments of unwonted\r\nmental phenomena can hardly be too diffident, or too circumspect. The\r\nmarvels of the faculty of memory which we all have read of; the prodigies\r\nof analysis which many of us have witnessed in the mental arithmeticians\r\nwho occasionally present themselves for exhibition; the very vagaries\r\nof the senses themselves, which occasionally follow certain abnormal\r\nconditions of the organs—are almost as wide a departure from what we are\r\naccustomed to in these departments, as is the greatest marvel related of\r\nMezzofanti in the faculty of language. Perhaps there could not be a more\r\nsignificant rebuke of this universal scepticism, than the fact that the\r\nvery event which Juvenal, in his celebrated sneer at the tale of\r\n\r\n    Velificatus Athos, et quidquid Græcia mendax\r\n    Audet in historiâ—\r\n\r\nhas selected as the type of self-convicted mendacity—the passage of\r\nXerxes’s fleet through Mount Athos—now proves to be not only possible,\r\nbut absolutely true; and it is wisely observed by Mr. Grote, that, while\r\nno amount of mere intrinsic probability is sufficient to establish the\r\ntruth of an unattested statement, on the other hand, “statements in\r\nthemselves highly improbable may well deserve belief, provided they be\r\nsupported by sufficient positive evidence.” (_Hist. of Greece_, I. 571.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are two heads of inquiry which appear to me specially deserving of\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nFirst, the number of languages with which Cardinal Mezzofanti was\r\nacquainted, and the degree of his proficiency in each.\r\n\r\nSecondly, his method of studying languages, and the peculiar mental\r\ndevelopment to which his extraordinary success as a linguist is\r\nattributable.\r\n\r\nI.—I wish I could begin, in accordance with a suggestion of my friend\r\nM. d’Abbadie, by defining exactly what is meant by _knowledge_ of a\r\nlanguage. But unfortunately, the shades of such knowledge are almost\r\ninfinite. The vocabularies of our modern languages contain as many\r\nas forty or fifty thousand words; and Claude Chappe, the inventor of\r\nthe telegraph, calculates, that for the complete expression of human\r\nthought and sentiment in all its forms, at least ten thousand words\r\nare necessary. On the other hand, M. d’Abbadie, in his explorations in\r\nAbyssinia, was able to make his way without an interpreter, though his\r\nvocabulary did not comprise quite six hundred words; and M. Julien,\r\nin his controversy with Pauthier, asserts that about four thousand\r\nwords will amply suffice even for the study of the great classics of a\r\nlanguage, as Homer, Byron, or Racine.\r\n\r\nWhich of these standards are we to adopt?\r\n\r\nAnd even if we fix upon any one of them, how shall we apply it to\r\nthe Cardinal, whereas we can only judge of him by the reports of his\r\nvisitors, who applied to him, each a standard of his own?\r\n\r\nIt is plain that any such strict philosophical notion, however desirable,\r\nwould be inapplicable in practice. It appears to me, however, that the\r\nobjects of this inquiry will be sufficiently attained by adopting a\r\npopular notion, founded upon the common estimation of mankind. I think a\r\nman may be truly said to know a language thoroughly, if he can read it\r\nfluently and with ease; if he can write it correctly in prose, or still\r\nmore, in verse; and above all, if he be admitted by intelligent and\r\neducated natives to speak it correctly and idiomatically.\r\n\r\nI shall be content to apply this standard to Cardinal Mezzofanti.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLooking back over the narrative of Cardinal Mezzofanti’s life, we can\r\ntrace a tolerably regular progress in the number of languages ascribed to\r\nhim through its several stages. In 1805, according to Father Caronni, “he\r\nwas commonly reported to be master of more than twenty-four languages.”\r\nGiordani’s account of him in 1812, seems, although it does not specify\r\nany number, to indicate a greater total than this. Stewart Rose, in\r\n1817, speaks of him as “reading twenty languages, and conversing in\r\neighteen.” Baron von Zach, in 1820, brings the number of the languages\r\nspoken by him up to thirty-two. Lady Morgan states, that by the public\r\nreport of Bologna he was reputed to be master of forty. He himself, in\r\n1836, stated to M. Mazzinghi that he knew forty-five; and before 1839, he\r\nused to say that he knew “fifty, and Bolognese.” In reply to the request\r\nof M. Mouravieff, a little later, that he would give him a list of the\r\nlanguages that he knew, he sent him a sheet containing the name of God in\r\nfifty-six languages. In the year 1846 he told Father Bresciani that he\r\nknew seventy-eight languages and dialects;[549] and a list communicated\r\nto me by his nephew, Dr. Gaetano Minarelli, by whom it has been compiled\r\nafter a diligent examination of his deceased uncle’s books and papers,\r\nreaches the astounding total of one hundred and fourteen!\r\n\r\nIt is clear, however, that these, and the similar statements which have\r\nbeen current, require considerable examination and explanation. It is\r\nmuch to be regretted that the Cardinal did not, with his own hand,\r\ndraw up, as he had often been requested, and as he certainly intended,\r\na complete catalogue of the languages known by him, distinguishing,\r\nas in the similar statement left by Sir William Jones, the degrees of\r\nhis knowledge of the several languages which it comprised. In none of\r\nthe statements on the subject which are in existence, is any attempt\r\nmade to discriminate the languages with which he was familiar from\r\nthose imperfectly known by him. On the contrary, from the tone of some\r\nof his panegyrists, it would seem that they wish to represent him as\r\nequally at home in all;—a notion which he himself, in his conversations\r\nwith Lady Morgan, with Dr. Tholuck, with M. Mazzinghi, and on many\r\nsubsequent occasions, distinctly repudiated and ridiculed. In his\r\nstatement to Father Bresciani, in 1846, the Cardinal did not enumerate\r\nthe seventy-eight languages and dialects which he knew or had studied;\r\nbut in the year before his death, 1848, he told Father Bresciani that he\r\nwas then engaged in drawing up a comparative scheme of languages, their\r\ncommon descent, their affinities, and their ramifications; together with\r\na simple and easy plan for acquiring a number of languages, however\r\ndissimilar.[550] At my request, Father Bresciani kindly applied to Dr.\r\nMinarelli, the nephew and representative of the deceased, for a copy\r\nof this interesting paper; but unfortunately no trace of it is now\r\ndiscoverable, and Dr. Minarelli supposes that, as was usual with him when\r\ndissatisfied with any of his compositions, the Cardinal burnt it before\r\nhis death.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of this search, however, Dr. Minarelli himself was led\r\nto draw up, partly from his own knowledge of his uncle’s attainments,\r\npartly from the inspection of his books and papers, a detailed list\r\nof the languages with which he believes the Cardinal to have been\r\nacquainted. This list he has kindly communicated to me. From its very\r\nnature, of course, it is to a great extent conjectural; it makes no\r\npretension to a scientific classification of the languages; and it\r\ncontains several evident oversights and errors; but as the writer, in\r\naddition to his long personal intercourse with his uncle, enjoyed the\r\nopportunity of access to his papers and memoranda, and above all to his\r\nbooks in various languages, his grammars, dictionaries, and vocabularies,\r\nand the marginal notes and observations—the schemes, paradigms,\r\ncritical analyses, and other evidences of knowledge, or at least of\r\nstudy—which they contain; and as he has been mainly guided by these in\r\nthe compilation of his list of languages, I shall translate the paper in\r\nits integrity, merely correcting certain obvious errors, and striking\r\nout a few of the items in the enumeration, in which, clearly by mistake,\r\nthe same language is twice repeated.

In its form, I regret to say, it is far from\r\nsatisfactory. It places on exactly the same level languages generically\r\ndistinct and mere provincial varieties of dialect. In one or two\r\ninstances, also, (as Angolese and Bunda, Swedish and Norwegian,) the same\r\nlanguage appears twice under different names. Above all, the compiler has\r\nnot attempted to classify the languages according _to the degree of the\r\nCardinal’s acquaintance with each of them_; nor has he entered into any\r\nexplanation of the nature of the evidence of acquaintance with each of\r\nthem which is supplied by the documents upon which he relies.[567]\r\n\r\nAs I cannot, consistently with the fundamental principle of this inquiry,\r\naccept such a statement, when unsupported by the testimony of native (or\r\notherwise competent) witnesses for the several languages, as conclusive\r\nevidence of the Cardinal’s knowledge of the languages which it ascribes\r\nto him, I shall merely offer this otherwise interesting paper at whatever\r\nmay be considered its just value; and I shall endeavour to decide the\r\nquestion upon grounds entirely independent of it, and drawn solely from\r\nthe materials which I have already placed before the reader.\r\n\r\nIt will, no doubt, have been observed that, so far as regards the reports\r\nof the travellers and others who conversed with the Cardinal, the degrees\r\nof his power of speaking the several languages have been very differently\r\ntested. In some languages he was, as it were, perpetually under trial:\r\nin others, very frequently, and in prolonged conversations; in others,\r\nless frequently, but nevertheless searchingly enough; in others, in\r\nfine, perhaps only to the extent of a few questions and answers. It is\r\nabsolutely necessary, in forming any judgment, to attend carefully to\r\nthis circumstance. I shall endeavour, therefore, to divide the languages\r\nascribed to him into four different classes.\r\n\r\nFirst, languages certainly spoken by Cardinal Mezzofanti with a\r\nperfection rare in foreigners.\r\n\r\nSecondly, languages which is he said to have spoken well, but as to which\r\nthe evidence of sufficient trial is not so complete.\r\n\r\nThirdly, languages which he spoke freely, but less perfectly.\r\n\r\nFourthly, languages in which he could merely express himself and initiate\r\na conversation. I shall add:—\r\n\r\nFifthly, certain other languages which he had studied from books, but\r\ndoes not appear to have spoken.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, dialects of the principal languages. This order, of course,\r\nprecludes all idea of a scientific classification[568] of the languages\r\naccording to families.\r\n\r\nI.—_Languages frequently tested, and spoken with rare excellence._[569]\r\n\r\n     1 Hebrew, (Supra, p. 283, 341, 345, 371.)\r\n     2 Rabbinical Hebrew, (283, 341.)\r\n     3 Arabic, (283, 371, 441.)\r\n     4 Chaldee, (278, 384, 362, 451.)\r\n     5 Coptic, (311, 441, 451.)\r\n     6 Ancient Armenian, (352, 441.)\r\n     7 Modern Armenian, (352, 441.)\r\n     8 Persian, (278, 352, 394.)\r\n     9 Turkish, (226, 311, 393, 441.)\r\n    10 Albanese, (362, 393, 451.)\r\n    11 Maltese, (336, 362.)\r\n    12 Greek, (353.)\r\n    13 Romaic, (353.)\r\n    14 Latin, (201, 347.)\r\n    15 Italian, (_passim._)\r\n    16 Spanish, (276, 312, 441.)\r\n    17 Portuguese, (337, 367.)\r\n    18 French, (271, 276, 387.)\r\n    19 German, (239, 250, 271, 277, 281, 325, 345, 346, 393.)\r\n    20 Swedish, (271, 272, 350, 351.)\r\n    21 Danish, (239, 281.)\r\n    22 Dutch, (328, 330, 332.)\r\n    23 Flemish, (324, 328.)\r\n    24 English, (223, 226, 228, 348, 403.)\r\n    25 Illyrian, (393, 441.)\r\n    26 Russian, (244, 442, 443.)\r\n    27 Polish, (328, 444, 447.)\r\n    28 Czechish, or Bohemian, (246, 233.)\r\n    29 Magyar, (242, 389, 391.)\r\n    30 Chinese, (309, 310, 365, 368, 369, 451.)\r\n\r\nII.—_Stated to have been spoken fluently, but hardly sufficiently tested._\r\n\r\n     1 Syriac, (354, 364.)\r\n     2 Geez, (383, 385, 394.)\r\n     3 Amarinna, (384, 385, 334.)\r\n     4 Hindostani, (364, 366.)\r\n     5 Guzarattee, (367.)\r\n     6 Basque, (393, 388.)\r\n     7 Wallachian, (216, 244.)\r\n     8 Californian, (355-7.)\r\n     9 Algonquin, (360-1.).\r\n\r\nIII. _Spoken rarely, and less perfectly._\r\n\r\n     1 Koordish, (394, 451.)\r\n     2 Georgian, (251, 394.)\r\n     3 Servian (the dialects of Bosnia and of the Bannat,) (394.)\r\n     4 Bulgarian, (365, 393, 441.)\r\n     5 Gipsy language, (244.)\r\n     6 Peguan, (364, 418, 451.)\r\n     7 Welsh, (320, 322, 323.)\r\n     8 Angolese, (370, 394.)\r\n     9 Mexican, (441.)\r\n    10 Chilian, (441.)\r\n    11 Peruvian, (441.)\r\n\r\nIV. _Spoken imperfectly;—a few sentences and conversational forms._\r\n\r\n     1 Cingalese, (363.)\r\n     2 Birmese, (270, 463.[570])\r\n     3 Japanese, (463.)\r\n     4 Irish, (442.)\r\n     5 Gælic, (424.)\r\n     6 Chippewa Indian, (360.)\r\n     7 Delaware, (360.)\r\n     8 Some of the languages of Oceanica, (441.)\r\n\r\nV. _Studied from books, but not known to have been spoken._\r\n\r\n     1 Sanscrit, (291, 394.)\r\n     2 Malay, (464.)\r\n     3 Tonquinese, (463.)\r\n     4 Cochin-Chinese, (463.)\r\n     5 Tibetan, (465.)\r\n     6 Japanese, (463.)\r\n     7 Icelandic, (464.)\r\n     8 Lappish, (394.)\r\n     9 Ruthenian, (311.)\r\n    10 Frisian, (282.)\r\n    11 Lettish, (394, 451.)\r\n    12 Cornish, (old British of Cornwall,) (280.)\r\n    13 Quichua, (ancient Peruvian,) (281.)\r\n    14 Bimbarra, (Central African,) (281.)\r\n\r\nVI.—_Dialects spoken, or their peculiarities understood._\r\n\r\n1.—HEBREW.\r\n\r\n    Samaritan, (416.)\r\n\r\n2.—ARABIC.\r\n\r\n    Syrian dialect (fluently, 371.)\r\n    Egyptian do., (311.)\r\n    Moorish, (171.)\r\n    Berber, (463.)\r\n\r\n3.—CHINESE.\r\n\r\n    Kiang-Si dialect, (416.)\r\n    Hu-quam do., (416.)\r\n\r\n4.—ITALIAN.\r\n\r\n    Sicilian, (324, 354.)\r\n    Sardinian, (158-9.)\r\n    Neapolitan, (324.)\r\n    Bolognese, (247, 344.)\r\n    Lombard, (464.)\r\n    Friulese, (464.)\r\n\r\n5.—SPANISH\r\n\r\n    Catalan, (441.)\r\n    Valencian, (441.)\r\n    Majorican, (441.)\r\n\r\n6.—BASQUE.\r\n\r\n    Labourdain, (387-8.)\r\n    Souletin, (387.)\r\n    Guipuscoan, (388.)\r\n\r\n7.—MAGYAR.\r\n\r\n    Debreczeny, (391.)\r\n    Eperies, (391.)\r\n    Pesth, (391.)\r\n    Transylvanian, (491.)\r\n\r\n8.—GERMAN.\r\n\r\n    Ancient Gothic, (464.)\r\n    Rhetian (Grisons,) (Appendix.)\r\n    _Sette Communi_ dialect, (218.)\r\n    Dialects of Northern and Southern Germany, (243.)\r\n\r\n9.—FRENCH.\r\n\r\n    Provençal, (275.)\r\n    Tolosan, (440.)\r\n    Burgundian, (444.)\r\n    Gascon, (463.)\r\n    Bearnais, (440.)\r\n    Lorraine, (463.)\r\n    Bas Breton, (439.)\r\n\r\n10.—ENGLISH.\r\n\r\n    Somersetshire, Yorkshire, and Lancashire dialects, (404.)\r\n    Lowland Scotch, (437.)\r\n\r\nI should add that many of these dialects, as the Moorish and Berber\r\nArabic, the Spanish of Majorca, the Provençal French, the Italian of\r\nSicily and Sardinia, and the language of the Grisons or Graubünden, might\r\nmost justly be described as separate languages, at least as regards the\r\ndifficulty of acquisition. In the catalogue of the Cavaliere Minarelli a\r\nseries of languages (the very names of which the reader probably never\r\nhas heard,) are enumerated, chiefly of the central and South American\r\nfamilies—of the former, the Cora, the Tepehuana, the Mistek, the Othomi,\r\nthe Maya; of the latter, the Paraguay, the Omagua, the Aymara, the\r\nCanisiana, and the Mobima. I am not aware of the authority on which the\r\nCavaliere relies in reference to these languages. For the majority of\r\nthem, I must say that I cannot find in the catalogue of the Cardinal’s\r\nlibrary any distinct trace whatever of his having studied them; but it\r\nis certain that he had given his attention early to the languages of\r\nthese countries; that he had opportunities in Bologna of conversing with\r\nex-Jesuit missionaries from the central and South American provinces; and\r\nthat the library of the Propaganda, of which he had the unrestricted use,\r\ncontains many printed and manuscript elementary works in languages of\r\nwhich little trace is elsewhere to be found.\r\n\r\nSumming up, therefore, all the authentic accounts of him as yet made\r\npublic; discarding the loose statements of superficial marvel-mongers,\r\nand divesting the genuine reports, as far as possible, of the vagueness\r\nby which many of them have been characterized, it appears that, in\r\naddition to a large number of (more than thirty) minor dialects,\r\nMezzofanti was acquainted in various degrees with seventy-two languages,\r\npopularly, if not scientifically, regarded as distinct:—almost the exact\r\nnumber which F. Bresciani ascribes to him; that of these he spoke with\r\nfreedom, and with a purity of accent, of vocabulary, and of idiom, rarely\r\nattained by foreigners, no fewer than thirty; that he was intimately\r\nacquainted with all the leading dialects of these; that he spoke less\r\nperfectly, (or rather is not shown to have possessed the same mastery\r\nof) nine others, in all of which, however, his pronunciation, at least,\r\nis described as quite perfect; that he could, (and occasionally did,)\r\nconverse in eleven other languages, but with what degree of accuracy it\r\nis difficult to say; that he could at least initiate a conversation,\r\nand exchange certain conversational forms in eight others; and that he\r\nhad studied the structure and the elementary vocabularies of fourteen\r\nothers. As regards the languages included in the latter categories, it\r\nis quite possible that he may also have spoken in a certain way some at\r\nleast among them. So far as I have learned, there is no evidence that he\r\nactually did speak any of them: but with him there was little perceptible\r\ninterval between knowledge of the elementary structure and vocabulary of\r\na language, and the power of conversing in it.\r\n\r\nSuch is the astounding result to which the united evidence of this\r\nvast body of witnesses, testifying without consent, and indeed for\r\nthe most part utterly unknown to each other, appears irresistibly to\r\nlead. I am far, I confess, from accepting in their strict letter many\r\nof the rhetorical expressions of these writers—the natural result of\r\nwarm admiration, however just and well founded. I do not believe, for\r\nexample, that in each and all the thirty languages enumerated in the\r\nfirst category, the Cardinal actually spoke, as some of the witnesses\r\nsay, “with all the purity and propriety of a native;” that he could not\r\nin any one of them “be recognized as a foreigner;” or that, in them\r\nall, he “spoke without the slightest trace of peculiar accent.” On the\r\ncontrary, I know that, in several of these, he made occasional trips.\r\nI do not overlook the “four minor mistakes” in his German conversation\r\nwith Dr. Tholuck; nor his occasionally “forgetting the marked _l_ in his\r\nPolish,” nor the criticism of his manner in several other languages,\r\nas “formed rather from books than from conversation.” Neither do I\r\nbelieve that he had mastered the _entire_ vocabulary of each of these\r\nlanguages. Nor shall I even venture to say to what point his knowledge\r\nof the several vocabularies extended. So far from shutting out from my\r\njudgment the drawbacks on the undiscriminating praise heaped upon the\r\nCardinal by some of his biographers, which these criticisms imply, I\r\nregard them as (by recalling it from the realm of legend,) forming the\r\nbest and most secure foundation of a reputation which, allowing for every\r\ndrawback, far transcends all that the world has ever hitherto known.\r\nI do not say that in all these languages, or perhaps in any of them,\r\nCardinal Mezzofanti was the perfect paragon which some have described\r\nhim; but, reverting to the standard with which I set out, I cannot\r\nhesitate to infer from these united testimonies, that his knowledge of\r\neach and every one of the leading languages of the world, ancient and\r\nmodern, fully equalled, and in several of these languages excelled, the\r\nknowledge of those who are commonly reputed as accomplished linguists in\r\nthe several languages, even when they have devoted their attention to\r\nthe study of one or other of these languages exclusively. I do not say\r\nthat he was _literally faultless_ in speaking these languages; nor that\r\nwhat I have said is literally true of _each and every one_ of the thirty\r\nthat have been enumerated: but, if the attestations recorded in this\r\nvolume have any meaning, they lead to the inevitable conclusion, that in\r\nthe power of speaking the languages in which he was best tried,—whether\r\nHebrew, or Arabic, or Armenian, or Persian, or Turkish, or Albanese,\r\nor Maltese, or Greek, or Romaic, or Latin, or Italian, or Spanish, or\r\nPortuguese, or French, or Swedish, or Danish, or Dutch, or Flemish, or\r\nEnglish, or Russian, or Bohemian, or Magyar, or Chinese;—his success is\r\nentirely beyond suspicion, and will bear comparison with that of the most\r\naccomplished non-native masters of these languages, even those who have\r\nconfined themselves to one or two of the number. For the few languages\r\nupon which I myself may presume to speak, I most unhesitatingly adopt\r\nthis conclusion, comparing my recollections of the Cardinal with those\r\nI retain of almost any other foreigner whom I have ever heard speak the\r\nsame languages.\r\n\r\nThe reader’s recollection of the attainments of the most remarkable\r\nlinguists enumerated in the memoir prefixed to this biography will enable\r\nhim, therefore, to see how immeasurably Cardinal Mezzofanti transcends\r\nthem all. Taking the very highest estimate which has been offered of\r\ntheir attainments, the list of those reputed to have possessed more\r\nthan ten languages is a very short one. Only four—Mithridates, Pico\r\nof Mirandola, Jonadab Alhanar, and Sir William Jones—are said, in the\r\nloosest sense, to have passed the limit of twenty. To the first two fame\r\nascribes twenty-two, to the last two twenty-eight languages. Müller,\r\nNiebuhr, Fulgence Fresnel, and perhaps Sir John Bowring, are usually set\r\ndown as knowing twenty languages. For Elihu Burritt, Csoma de Körös,\r\ntheir admirers claim eighteen. Renaudot, the controversialist, is said\r\nto have known seventeen, Professor Lee sixteen, and the attainments of\r\nthe older linguists, as Arias Montamus, Martin del Rio, the converted\r\nRabbi Libertas Cominetus, the Admirable Crichton—are said to have ranged\r\nfrom this down to ten or twelve—most of them the ordinary languages of\r\nlearned and of polite society. It is further to be observed that in no\r\none of those cases has the evidence been examined, the trustworthiness\r\nof the witnesses considered, or the degrees of knowledge of the various\r\nlanguages ascertained. Whatever of doubt rests even upon the vaguest\r\nstatements regarding Mezzofanti, applies with double force in every one\r\nof the above instances.\r\n\r\nBut even putting these considerations aside, and accepting the estimates\r\nupon the showing of the parties themselves or their admirers, how far\r\ndoes the very highest of them fall short of what has been demonstrated of\r\nCardinal Mezzofanti!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nII. On the curious question as to the system pursued by the Cardinal\r\nin the study of languages, I regret to say that little light seems now\r\nobtainable. The variety of systems employed by students is endless.\r\nThe eccentric linguist, Roberts Jones, described in the Introductory\r\nMemoir, as soon as he had an opportunity of comparing the vocabulary of\r\na new language with those which he had already studied, proceeded by\r\n_striking out of it_ all those words which were common to it with any of\r\nthe languages already familiar to him, and then impressing on his memory\r\n_the words which remained_. M. Antoine d’Abbadie told me that, in the\r\nunwritten languages with which he had to deal, his plan was to write\r\nout, with the aid of an interpreter, a list of about five hundred of the\r\nleading and most indispensable words, and a few conversational forms; and\r\nthen to complete his stock of words “by the assistance of _an intelligent\r\nchild who knew no language but the one which he was studying_;—because\r\nchildren best understand, and most readily apprehend, an imperfectly\r\nconveyed meaning.” Some students commence with the vocabulary; others,\r\nwith the structural forms of a language. With some the process is tedious\r\nand full of labour: others proceed with almost the rapidity of intuition.\r\nIn comparing the various possible systems, it has not unnaturally\r\nbeen supposed that the process which, in Cardinal Mezzofanti, led to\r\nresults so rapid and so extraordinary, might be usefully applied, at\r\nleast in some modified form, to the practical study of languages, even\r\non that modest scale in which they enter into ordinary education. But\r\nunfortunately, even if such a fruit could be hoped from his experience,\r\nit does not appear that the Cardinal possessed any extraordinary secret,\r\nor at least that he ever clearly explained to any of his visitors the\r\nsecret process, if any, which he employed. One thing at least is certain,\r\nand should not be forgotten by those who are always on the look out for\r\nshort roads to learning, that, whatever may have been his system, and\r\nhowever it may have quickened or facilitated the result for him, it did\r\nnot enable him to dispense with the sedulous and systematic use of all\r\nthe ordinary appliances of study, and especially of every available means\r\nfor the acquisition of vocabularies, and of practice in their exercise.\r\n\r\nIt is true he told M. Libri that he found the learning of languages\r\n“less difficult than is generally thought: that there is but a limited\r\nnumber of points to which it is necessary to direct attention; and that,\r\nwhen one is master of these points, the remainder follows with great\r\nfacility;” adding that, “when one has learned ten or a dozen languages\r\nessentially different from each other, one may, with a little study and\r\nattention, learn any number of them.” But he also stated to Dr. Tholuck\r\n“that his own way of learning new languages was no other than that of\r\nour school-boys, by writing out paradigms and words, and committing\r\nthem to memory.” (P. 278.) Dictionaries, reading-books, catechisms,\r\nvocabularies, were anxiously sought by him, and industriously used. The\r\nsociety and conversation of strangers was eagerly—in one less modest\r\nand simple it might almost appear obtrusively—courted, and turned to\r\nadvantage. A constant and systematic habit of translation and composition\r\nboth in prose and verse was maintained. In a word, nothing can be\r\nclearer than that with Mezzofanti, as with the humblest cultivators of\r\nthe same study, the process of acquiring each new language was, if not\r\nslow, at least laborious; and that, with all his extraordinary gifts,\r\nthe eminence to which he attained, is in great part to be attributed to\r\nhis own almost unexampled energy, and to the perseverance with which he\r\ncontinued to cultivate these gifts to the very latest day of his life.\r\nHe understood thoroughly, as all who have ever attained to eminence\r\nhave understood, the true secret of study—economical and systematic\r\nemployment of time. The great jurist D’Aguesseau composed one of his\r\nmost valuable works in the scraps of time which he was able to save\r\nfrom his wife’s unpunctuality in the hour of dinner. Mezzofanti made it\r\na rule, even amid his most frequent and most distracting occupations,\r\nto turn to account every chance moment in which he was released from\r\nactual pressure. No matter how brief or how precarious the interval, his\r\nbooks and papers were generally at hand. And even when no such appliance\r\nof study were within reach his active and self-concentrated mind was\r\nconstantly engaged. He possessed a rare power of self-abstraction, by\r\nwhich he was able to concentrate all his faculties upon any language\r\nwhich he desired to pursue, to the exclusion of all the others that he\r\nknew. In this respect he was entirely independent of books. When the\r\ngreat mathematician, Euler, became blind, he was able to form the most\r\ncomplicated diagrams, and to resolve the most intricate calculations, in\r\nhis mind. Every one has heard, too, of cases like that of the prisoner\r\ndescribed by Pope:—\r\n\r\n    Who, locked from ink and paper, scrawls\r\n    With desperate charcoal on his darkened walls.\r\n\r\nBut Mezzofanti’s power of mental study was even more wonderful. He\r\nhad the habit of _thinking when alone, in each and all of his various\r\nlanguages_ in succession; so that, without the presence of a second\r\nindividual, he almost enjoyed the advantage of practice in conversation!\r\nThe only parallel for this extraordinary mental phenomenon that I know,\r\nis a story which I have somewhere read, of a musician who attained to\r\ngreat perfection as an instrumental performer, although hardly ever known\r\nto touch an instrument for the purpose of practice. This man, it is said,\r\nwas _constantly practising in his mind_; and his fingers were actually\r\nobserved to be always in motion, as though engaged in the act of playing.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is certain that Mezzofanti’s power of acquiring\r\nlanguages was mainly a gift of nature. It is not easy to say in what this\r\nnatural gift consisted. Among the faculties of the mind chiefly employed\r\nin acquiring language—perception, analysis, judgment, and memory—by some\r\nit has been placed in his intuitive quickness of perception—by others\r\nin his memory—and by others, in his power of analysing the leading\r\ninflexional and structural characteristics by which each language is\r\ndistinguished. Others place it in some mysterious delicacy of his\r\near, which detected in each language a sort of rhythm or systematic\r\nstructure, and thus supplied a key to all its forms. But no one of these\r\ncharacteristics, taken singly, even in its very highest development, will\r\naccount for a success so entirely unexampled. Almost all great linguists,\r\nit is true, have been remarkable for their powers of memory; but there\r\nare many examples of such memory, unaccompanied by any very peculiar\r\nexcellence in the gift of languages. Still less can it be ascribed\r\nexclusively to any quickness of perception, or any perfection of analytic\r\nor synthetic power. Perhaps there is no form in which these powers are so\r\nwondrously displayed, as in the curious phenomena of mental arithmetic.\r\nAnd yet I am not aware that any of the extraordinary mental calculators\r\nhas been distinguished as a linguist. On the contrary, many of them have\r\nbeen singularly deficient in this respect. Mr. George Bidder, one of the\r\nlatest, and in many respects most creditable, examples of this faculty,\r\nconfesses his entire deficiency in talent for literature or language; and\r\nZachariah Dase, whose performances as a calculator almost exceeded all\r\nbelief, could never master a word of any foreign language except a little\r\nGerman.\r\n\r\nBut in Cardinal Mezzofanti we meet not only each of these qualities, but\r\na most perfect and perfectly balanced union of them all. His memory in\r\nitself would have made him an object of wonder. Quick and tenacious to a\r\ndegree certainly not inferior to any recorded example of the faculty, it\r\nwas one of the most universal in its application of which any record is\r\npreserved; embracing every variety of subject—not alone the vocabularies\r\nand forms which he acquired, but every kind of matter to which it was\r\ndirected; history, poetry, and even persons and personal occurrences. But\r\nthere was, above all, one characteristic in which it was distinguished\r\nfrom almost all other memories. Some of those qualities already named\r\nwere possessed by other individuals in an equal, if not a greater or more\r\nstriking, degree. Henderson, the player, was said to be able to repeat\r\nthe greater part of the most miscellaneous contents of a newspaper after\r\na single reading; and the mental arithmetician just named, Zachariah\r\nDase, after _dipping_ his eye over a row of twelve figures, could repeat\r\nthem backwards and forwards, and in every other order, and could multiply\r\nthem instantaneously by one or two figures at pleasure. Some memories\r\ntoo possessed this faculty entirely independent of the judgment or the\r\nreasoning powers. Père Menestrier was able to repeat a long jumble of\r\nunmeaning names after hearing them but once, and the young Corsican\r\nmentioned by Padre Menocchio could do the same, even after the lapse of\r\nan entire year! But the perfection of Mezzofanti’s memory was different\r\nfrom all these, and consisted in its _extraordinary readiness_. Sir W.\r\nHamilton, in one of his notes on Reid, happily reviving an old view of\r\nAristotle, distinguishes between _memory_ (μνημή) and _reminiscence_,\r\n(ἀνάμνησις)—between spontaneous and elaborated memory—memory of\r\nintuition, and memory of evolution. In Mezzofanti the latter hardly\r\nappears to have had a place. His memory seems to have acted by intuition\r\nalone. It was not only a rare capacity for storing up and retaining the\r\nimpressions once made upon it, no matter how rapid and how various, but a\r\npower of holding them _distinct from each other_, and ready for instant\r\nuse. And thus, over the vast and various assortment of vocabularies\r\nwhich he possessed, he enjoyed a control so complete, that he would\r\ndraw upon each and all at pleasure, as the medium for the expression of\r\nhis thoughts;—just as the experimentalist, by the shifting of a slide,\r\ncan change, instantaneously and at will, the colour of the light with\r\nwhich he illuminates the object of exhibition. Dugald Stewart tells the\r\ncase of a young woman who could repeat an entire sermon after a single\r\nhearing, and whose sole trick of memory consisted in connecting in her\r\nmind each part of the discourse with a part of the ceiling. It would\r\nalmost seem as if the memory of Mezzofanti had some such local division\r\ninto compartments, in which the several vocabularies _could_, as it were,\r\n_be stored apart_, and through which his mind could range at pleasure,\r\nculling from each the objects or words which it desired, no matter how\r\nvarious or how unconnected with each other.\r\n\r\nWith such a memory as this to guide its action, and to supply the\r\nmaterial for its operation, the extraordinary and almost intuitive power\r\nof analysis—something in its own order like what Wollaston called in\r\nWilliam Phillips, the “mathematical sense”—which Mezzofanti possessed,\r\nand which enabled him at once to seize upon the whole system of a\r\nlanguage—form, structure, idiom, genius, spirit—led by a process which it\r\nis easy to understand, to the wonderful results which this great linguist\r\naccomplished. Memory supplied the material with unfailing abundance and\r\nregularity. The analytic faculties were the tools which the mind employed\r\nin operating upon the material thus supplied for the use.\r\n\r\nSuch appears to have been the mental process. But for the practical power\r\nof speaking the languages thus mastered in theory, Mezzofanti was also\r\nindebted to his singularly quick and delicate organization of ear and\r\ntongue. It might seem that the former of these organs could only enter\r\nas a very subordinate element, and in a purely mechanical way, into\r\nthe faculty of speech. Indeed the French journals of the past month,\r\n(February, 1858,) contain an account of a deaf and dumb man, M. Moser,\r\nwho (of course entirely unaided by ear,) has mastered, besides Greek and\r\nLatin, no fewer than fourteen modern languages. But, strange as this may\r\nseem, it is certain that in Mezzofanti’s case the ear, in addition to\r\nits direct and natural use in comprehending and catching up the sounds\r\nof languages, and appreciating all their delicate varieties and shades,\r\n(in which it is admitted to have been ready and infallible beyond all\r\nprecedent,) had a nobler, and as it were, more intellectual function;\r\nthat its office was a thing of mind as well as of organization; that he\r\npossessed, as it were, _an inner and higher sense_, distinct from the\r\n_material organ_; and that the impressions which this sense conveyed,\r\nhelped him to the structure and the philosophical character of language,\r\nas well as to its rhythm, its vocal sounds, and its peculiar intonations.\r\nIt is difficult to explain the exact mental operation, by which this\r\ncurious result was attained; but the Cardinal himself repeatedly declared\r\nhis consciousness of such an operation, and ascribed to it, in a great\r\ndegree, the rapidity and the ease with which he overcame what to others\r\nform the main difficulty in the study of a language, and with which,\r\nhaving once made the first step in each language, he mastered, as if by\r\nintuition, all the mysteries of its structural system.\r\n\r\nAnother element of his wonderful talent was his genuine enthusiasm\r\nand the unpretending simplicity of his character. “Pretension,” says\r\nEmerson, “may sit still, but cannot act.” There was no pretension about\r\nMezzofanti; nor had he anything of that morbid intellectual sensitiveness\r\nwhich shrinks from the first blunders to which a novice in a foreign\r\nlanguage is exposed, and which restrains many from the attempt to speak,\r\nby the very apprehension of failure.[571] Children, as is well known,\r\nlearn to speak a language more rapidly than their elders. I cannot doubt\r\nthat Mezzofanti’s child-like simplicity and innocence, were among the\r\ncauses of his wonderful success as a speaker of many tongues.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was not to be expected that a man so eminent in one absorbing pursuit\r\nshould have made a very distinguished figure in general literature or\r\nscience. Among the many laudatory reports of him which are contained\r\nin this volume, a few will be found which hardly concede to him even a\r\nsecond-rate place as a scholar, still less as a philologer. In some of\r\nthe literary circles of Rome, Mezzofanti was not popular. M. Libri[572]\r\nalludes to one source of unfriendly feeling in his regard. There is\r\nanother which may perhaps have already struck the reader. From some of\r\nthe facts noticed in the Introductory Memoir of German linguists[573]\r\nand from other incidental allusions, the reader will have observed a\r\ncertain tendency on the part of philologers to depreciate the pursuit of\r\nlinguists, and to undervalue its usefulness; and it is precisely from\r\nthe philologers that this low estimate of Mezzofanti proceeds. It is\r\nonly just, however, to Baron Bunsen, who is pre-eminently the head of\r\nthe German school of that science, to admit that he carefully draws the\r\ndistinction between the two branches of the study of language—that of the\r\nlinguist, and that of the philologer. And although the natural preference\r\nwhich a student unconsciously gives to his own favourite pursuit, no\r\ndoubt leads him to attach little value to what Mezzofanti knew, and to\r\ndwell more on what in his opinion he did not know, yet it must be said\r\nthat he gives him full credit for his unexampled power as a linguist.\r\n\r\nThe Baron’s recollections, nevertheless, contain a summary of the\r\nstrictures upon the literary character of Mezzofanti, which were current\r\nduring his lifetime—that his learning was merely superficial—that in the\r\nphrase of the late Mr. Francis Hare, “with the keys of the knowledge of\r\nevery nation in his hand, he never unlocked their real treasures;” that\r\nin all the countless languages which he spoke he “never said anything;”\r\nthat he left no work or none of any value behind him; that he was utterly\r\nignorant of philology; that his theology was mere scholasticism; that\r\nhe had no idea of Biblical criticism, and that even as a critical Greek\r\nscholar, he was very deficient.\r\n\r\nIt would be a very mistaken zeal for the honour of Cardinal Mezzofanti\r\nto deny the literal truth of several of these criticisms. Most of the\r\nbranches of knowledge in which he is here represented as deficient, are\r\nin themselves the study of an ordinary life. To have added them all to\r\nwhat he really did possess, would have been a marvel far exceeding the\r\ngreatest wonder that has ever been ascribed to him; nor was any one\r\nmore ready than the modest Cardinal himself, not merely to admit many\r\nparticulars in which his learning was defective, but even to disparage\r\nthe learning which he actually possessed. He confessed over and over\r\nagain, that he was no philologer—that he was nothing but “an ill bound\r\ndictionary.” He expressed his regret to Guido Görres, that he had begun\r\nhis studies at a time when this science was not cultivated. He lamented\r\nthe weakness of his chest and other constitutional infirmities, which\r\nprevented him from writing. He deplored to Cardinal Wiseman, that, when\r\nhe should be gone, he would have left behind him no trace of what he knew.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding his own modest estimate of himself, I think enough\r\nwill be found in the testimonies of many unsuspected witnesses embodied\r\nin this Memoir, to shew that the depreciating strictures, to which I have\r\nhere alluded, are grievously exaggerated. Cardinal Mezzofanti certainly\r\nwas not a scientific philologer; but the Abbé Gaume’s memorandum proves\r\nthat, while he had little taste for the mere speculative part of the\r\nsubject—for those\r\n\r\n    Cloud-built towers by ghostly masons wrought,\r\n    On shadowy thoroughfares of thought—\r\n\r\nhe was fully sensible of the true use of the science, and had not\r\nneglected the study, especially in its most important aspect—its bearing\r\nupon religious history. He was not a professed archæologist. He may have\r\nfailed in the interpretation of the particular Greek inscription, to\r\nwhich Baron Bunsen refers; nor did he pursue Greek criticism as a special\r\nstudy. But his friends Cavedoni and Laureani, themselves accomplished\r\narchæologists, entertained the highest respect for his judgment in that\r\nstudy. The Abate Matranga bore ample witness to the depth and accuracy\r\nof his Greek scholarship; and I myself, in the few observations which I\r\nheard him offer on the Eugubian inscriptions, was struck by the sagacity,\r\nthe precision, and the suggestive spirit which they evinced.\r\n\r\nFar more unjust, however, are Mr. Hare’s remark about the keys, and the\r\nstill more disparaging saying, quoted by Baron Bunsen, which describes\r\nMezzofanti as, “with all his forty-two languages, never saying anything.”\r\nThe numberless reports of visitors at every period of his life, from Mr.\r\nStewart Rose, in 1817, downwards, which are detailed in this volume, put\r\nentirely beyond question both his capacity and his actual attainments\r\nin general literature. Each visitor, for the most part, found him well\r\nacquainted with the literature of his own country. Very many of them\r\n(as Baron Glucky de Stenitzer for Hungary[574]) bear witness to his\r\nfamiliarity with their national histories. His conversation with M.\r\nLibri, “on the most difficult points in the history of India,” evinced a\r\nmind of a very different calibre from what these supercilious criticisms\r\nsuppose: and, from the historian of the Mathematical Sciences, it is no\r\nordinary compliment towards one with whom these can have been but a\r\nsubordinate study, that, without a moment’s preparation, (the subject\r\nhaving been only casually introduced by M. Libri,) he “spoke for\r\nhalf-an-hour on the astronomy and mathematics of the Indian races, in\r\na manner which would have done honour to a man whose chief occupation\r\nhad been tracing the history of the sciences.”[575] I must dissent\r\nstrongly, also, from the disparaging opinion that M. Bunsen expresses\r\nas to the Cardinal’s capacity for the more strictly professional\r\nsciences of Biblical criticism and Theology. M. Bunsen, no doubt, when\r\nhe speaks of Biblical criticism, speaks mainly of the German School of\r\nthat science, and very probably of the last and most popular critic,\r\nLachmann. Now, with all their merits, there is much in the spirit and\r\nthe language of many of these writers, and, I may specially say, of\r\nLachmann, against which Mezzofanti’s whole mind would have revolted; and\r\nI can well understand that, between his opinions and those of the Baron\r\nregarding them, there would have been but little sympathy. But it is\r\nmost unjust to Mezzofanti to say that “he had no idea” of the subject.\r\nOne of his earliest literary friends was the great Biblical scholar and\r\ncritic, De Rossi. While he was still professor at Bologna, the Abate\r\nCavedoni, of Modena, spoke with high praise of his ability as a biblical\r\ncritic. The Abate Mellini, professor of Scripture in Bologna, gratefully\r\nacknowledges the assistance which he derived from him in reference to the\r\nversions of the Bible: and Cardinal Wiseman, who will not be suspected\r\nof undervaluing any branch of Biblical science, told me that, although\r\nit is quite true that Mezzofanti had no love for the German critics,\r\nand though he never was a professed critic himself, he was nevertheless\r\nquite conversant with the science, and understood its history and its\r\nprinciples, and the divisions of MMS., recensions, families, &c.,\r\nperfectly well.\r\n\r\nAs to Theology, his reputation in Rome was not high. Yet his attainments,\r\nespecially in moral theology, were considered respectable. The readers\r\nof Sir W. Hamilton will not look on the charge of “scholasticism” as any\r\nvery grave disparagement; but I must add that neither did Mezzofanti\r\nneglect the modern divines, even those outside of Italy. With Guido\r\nGörres he spoke of Möhler’s well-known _Symbolik_, although it was at\r\nthat period but little known beyond the limits of Germany.\r\n\r\nAs a preacher, Mezzofanti, though earnest and impressive, never was\r\nin any way remarkable. He confined himself chiefly to the duty of\r\ncatechetical instruction; and in Rome his only efforts as a preacher,\r\nwere the short and simple exhortations addressed to children at the time\r\nof admitting them to their first Communion—a duty of the ministry which\r\nwas especially dear to him.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that all these criticisms of Mezzofanti, and the\r\nimpressions as to the superficial character of his acquirements which\r\nthey embody, have emanated for the most part from casual visitors, who\r\nsaw him but for a brief space, and whose opportunity of testing his\r\nknowledge was probably limited to a few questions and answers, in a\r\nlanguage not his own; the main object of the visit being, not to sound\r\nthe depth or accuracy of his knowledge in itself, but merely the fluency\r\nand correctness of his manner of speaking the language in which the\r\nvisitor desired to try him. Whereas, on the contrary, those who bear\r\nwitness to the solidity of his information and the vast range of his\r\nknowledge, are those who knew him long and intimately; who met him as a\r\nfriend and companion, not as an object of curiosity, and of wonder; and\r\nwhose estimate of him was founded upon the impressions of familiar and\r\nevery-day intercourse—the only safe test of character or of acquirements.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is more truth in the strictures upon Mezzofanti as a writer. In\r\nthis respect, indeed, he is known very little; for his only published\r\ncomposition, the Panegyric of Father Aponte, and the fugitive poetical\r\nexercises in the appendix of this Memoir, can hardly be said to place him\r\nin the category of authors. Unhappily, indeed, the spirit of authorship\r\nis, with many, a question rather of temperament than of ability. In some\r\nit is the very breath of their life—an actual necessity of existence. To\r\nothers it is a barren and ungrateful labour—undertaken with reluctance,\r\nand pursued without satisfaction. Southey used to say, that he never\r\nfelt fully master of himself and of all his unclouded faculties, till\r\nhe found himself seated at his desk. The current of his thoughts never\r\nflowed freely except through his pen. On the contrary, Magliabecchi—the\r\nliving library—the _helluo librorum_—never could prevail on himself to\r\npublish a single line! Unfortunately for science, Mezzofanti was of the\r\nlatter class. Partly from constitutional delicacy, and especially from\r\nweakness of the chest, the effort of writing was to him irksome and\r\neven injurious. Partly too, no doubt, the same constitutional tendency\r\nof mind which rendered speaking easy and attractive, indisposed him for\r\nthe more toilsome—to him positively distressing—mode of communicating\r\nhis thoughts by writing. Except for the purposes of private study,\r\ntherefore, he seldom wrote more than some fugitive piece; and, even\r\nwhen he was prevailed on to write at greater length, he was seldom\r\nsufficiently satisfied with his own performances to permit them to be\r\nmade public. Several, even of these essays which were read by him in the\r\nlearned societies of Bologna and Rome, are known to have been destroyed\r\nby himself before his death; including some which, from their title\r\nand subject, might naturally have been expected to afford some insight\r\ninto the character of his mind, and his capacity for dealing with the\r\nphilosophy of language.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the small figure which he made as a writer, and the little\r\ntrace which he has left behind him of the vast stores of languages\r\nwhich he had laid up during life, have led to an undue depreciation\r\nof his career, as objectless and unprofitable, whether to himself or\r\nto his fellow-men. Whatever be the truth of this estimate, no one was\r\nmore painfully sensible of it than the Cardinal himself. Many of his\r\nexpressions of regret have been already recorded; but only those who knew\r\nhim intimately, could know the depth and sincerity of his repinings.\r\nStill, although it is not possible to avoid sharing in this regret, he\r\nwould be very exacting, indeed, and would set up for himself a very\r\nterrible standard whereby to judge his own conduct, who could venture to\r\npronounce such a career as Mezzofanti’s empty or unprofitable. Even if\r\nwe put aside entirely the consideration of his literary life, and test\r\nhim by the rules of personal duty alone, the life of Cardinal Mezzofanti\r\nwas a model of every virtue of the Christian and of the priest. Devout\r\nalmost to scrupulousness, sincerely humble, simple in his habits, modest\r\nand unexacting in his own person, but spending himself unhesitatingly\r\nin the service of others; courteous, amiable, affectionate, warm in his\r\nfriendships, he was known only to be loved, and he never forfeited a\r\nfriendship which he once had formed. His benevolence was of the true\r\nChristian stamp—not a mere unreflecting impulse, but a sustained and\r\nsystematic love of his fellow creatures. Although his charity was of the\r\ntenderest and most melting kind—although in truth, like Goldsmith’s Vicar,\r\n\r\n    His pity gave, ere charity began—\r\n\r\nalthough his alms, limited as were his means, were so prodigal as\r\nto earn for him the sobriquet of _Monsignor Limosiniere_, “_My Lord\r\nAlmoner_;”—yet it would be a great mistake to measure his benevolence\r\nby the actual extent of poverty which it relieved, or of the assistance\r\nit administered. His active spirit grasped every detail of this work of\r\nGod—the care of the sick, the instruction of the young, the edification\r\nand enlightenment of the stranger;—nay, the very courtesies of social\r\nintercourse had for him all the sacred significance of a duty; and, while\r\nhe never offended the sensibility of his companions by unseasonably\r\nobtruding over-serious conversation, yet he never lost sight, even in\r\nhis lightest hours, of the obligation of good example and edification\r\nwhich his position and character imposed upon him.\r\n\r\nAnd as regards the great pursuit of his literary life, which some have\r\npresumed to deny as “empty word-knowledge,” and unprofitable display, it\r\nmust never be forgotten—even though we should be content to judge its\r\nvalue by the selfish standard of mere utility—that, for himself, one of\r\nits earliest and most attractive, as well as most endearing sources of\r\ninterest, lay in the opportunity which it afforded him for the exercise\r\nof his sacred ministry and the only less sacred offices of charity and\r\nhumanity; that many of its most precious acquisitions were gathered in\r\nthese very exercises of religion and of benevolence; that his usual text\r\nbooks in each new language were the catechism and the Bible; and that his\r\nfavourite theatre for the display of his gifts were the sick wards of the\r\nhospitals of Bologna, the Santo Spirito or the House of Catechumens at\r\nRome, and the halls and _camerate_ of the great Missionary College of the\r\nPropaganda.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I cannot envy the moral and intellectual utilitarianism,\r\nwhich pauses to measure by so paltry a standard a great psychological\r\nphenomenon, such as Nature, in the most prodigal exercise of her powers,\r\nhas never before given to man to see. As well might we shut our eyes\r\nto the glory of those splendid meteors which at intervals illumine the\r\nsky, because we are unable to see what cold and sordid purpose of human\r\nutility they may be made to subserve.\r\n\r\nI prefer to look to him with grateful and affectionate admiration, as\r\na great example of the successful cultivation of one of the noblest of\r\nGod’s gifts to His creatures;—as the man who has approached nearest\r\nto the withdrawal of that barrier to intercommunion of speech which,\r\nin punishment of human pride, was set up at Babel; and of whom, more\r\nliterally than of any other son of Adam, it may be said, that he could\r\n\r\n    Hold converse with all forms\r\n    Of the many-sided mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Allusion is made, more than once, in this volume, to Cardinal\r\nMezzofanti’s habit of amusing himself and his friends by writing short\r\nmetrical pieces in various languages, and of composing or correcting\r\nthe odes recited by the pupils at the annual Polyglot Academy of the\r\nPropaganda. In the absence of other data for judging of his skill as a\r\nlinguist, these fragments, trifling though they be, are of considerable\r\ninterest; and I had hopes of being able to form a little collection of\r\nthem, as a contribution to the enquiry regarding him. Unfortunately my\r\nsearch for these remains, trivial and fugitive as most of them must have\r\nbeen, has been very unsuccessful. I am only able to add a few to those\r\nwhich appear in the sheet of fac-similes, or which have been already\r\nincidentally introduced in the course of the narrative.\r\n\r\nThe short pieces recited at the Propaganda Academy, being the property of\r\nthe pupils themselves, are not preserved in the college archives. I have\r\nonly succeeded in obtaining four of these pieces:—two from Rome, a Greek\r\nAnacreontic Ode, and a couple of stanzas in the Grisons dialect; and\r\ntwo in Angolese from the Rev. Charles Fernando, Missionary Apostolic in\r\nCeylon.\r\n\r\nThe Abbate Mazza, Vice-Rector of the Pontifical Seminary at Bologna, has\r\nkindly sent me a Hebrew Psalm addressed by Mezzofanti, as a tribute on\r\nhis Jubilee (or the fiftieth anniversary of his ordination as a priest),\r\nto his old friend and master, Father Emmanuel Aponte; and a Latin\r\nHexameter Poem, descriptive of St. Peter’s Church at Rome, recited by him\r\nin the _Accademia degli Arcadi_, on his being elected a member of that\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThese little pieces, it need hardly be said, are offered merely as\r\nspecimens of Mezzofanti’s power as a linguist, and not as possessing any\r\nstriking excellence, whether of poetry or sentiment. It is only just to\r\nhis memory to add that, judging from his well-known habit of composition,\r\nthey may all be presumed to be literally _impromptu_, and are entitled to\r\nthe full indulgence usually accorded to such productions.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _Hebrew Psalm,[576] addressed to Father Emmanuel Aponte—on the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of his ordination._\r\n\r\n    לסיוף מהזופאנתי\r\n\r\n    א. שמך עמנואל שס טוב כשמן תורף ץל כן רצו נץריﬦ ואהיבוך וזקניﬦ\r\n    גם המה בקשו חכמה שפתיך\r\n\r\n    ב. מה גאוו צל צייﬦ רגליך מבשר משמיץ משמיץ שלוס מבשר טוב משמיץ\r\n    ישוץה\r\n\r\n    ג. אור גגה בארצסו בץﬨ באך ממזרת מאז הגדלת השמחה והרביﬨ דץﬨ\r\n    ומוםר נﬨﬨ לרﬥ דורשי בינה ואור פני אדני בכל מץשיך ראו ץינינו\r\n\r\n    ד. הנה היום החלפת כנשר לבוא משכנות אדגי ואחרי חמישים שנﬣ תוצא\r\n    עוד לחם ויין כהן לאל ץליון כהן ץולם ץל דברתי מלכיצדך\r\n\r\n    ה. לכו נננו לארנדי ﬨשוץה לעור ישץנו כי התלה זקן טוכ חסיד לו\r\n    לגשת אליו לכהן להתפלל לפניו ולכתר ץןיגו\r\n\r\n    ו. גתת ארני לעמגואל חן וכבוד כי ﬣלך בתמים למד חןכמה ועאה עדק\r\n\r\n    ז. וץﬨה לנך אזנך אלהיﬦ מלך הכבור ץנה עבדיך תלמידי זקן טוב תן לו\r\n    ארך ומיﬦ ורצון וברכה תעטרהו\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Note: A better version might be:\r\n\r\n    ליוסף מהזופאנתי\r\n\r\n    א. שמך עמנואל שם טוב כשמן תורק על כן רצו נערים ואהיבוך וזקנים\r\n    גם המה בקשו חכמה שפתיך\r\n\r\n    ב. מה גאוו על איים רגליך מבשר משמיע משמיע שלום מבשר טוב משמיע\r\n    ישועה\r\n\r\n    ג. אור נגה בארצנו בעת באך ממזרח מאז הגדלת השמחה והרבית דעה\r\n    ומוסר נתת לכל דורשי בינה ואור פני אדני בכל מעשיך ראו עינינו\r\n\r\n    ד. הנה היום החלפת כנשר לבוא משכנות אדגי ואחרי חמישים שנה תוצא\r\n    עוד לחם ויין כהן לאל עליון כהן עולם על דברתי מלכיצדך\r\n\r\n    ה. לכו רננו לאדני תשועה לצור ישענו כי הפלה זקן טוב חסיד לו לגשת\r\n    אליו לכהן להתפלל לפניו ולכפר עלינו\r\n\r\n    ו. נתת אדני לעמגואל חן וכבוד כי הלך בתמים למד חכמה ועאה עדק\r\n\r\n    ז. ועתה לנך אזנך אלהים מלך הכבוד ענה עבדיך תלמידי זקן טוב תן לו\r\n    ארך יומים ורצון וברכה תעטרהו\r\n\r\n_Latin Translation._\r\n\r\n                          Josephus Mezzofanti.\r\n\r\n    1.

Nat._ VI.,\r\n5. Miller’s Ed. II., 176.) The Arabian writers, Ibn Haukal and Musadi,\r\nmention seventy-two languages which were spoken at Derbent. Strabo speaks\r\nof twenty-six in the Eastern Caucasus alone. See _The Tribes of the\r\nCaucasus_, p. 14, also p. 32.\r\n\r\n[7] Dahlmann, p. 47. It would be presumptuous to differ from so ingenious\r\na writer, and so profound a master of the subject which he treats; but I\r\nmay observe that there are some passages of Herodotus which seem to imply\r\na certain degree at least of acquaintance with Egyptian (for instance II.\r\n79, II. 99), and with the ancient language of Persia, as IX. 100, &c. It\r\nmust be admitted, however, that a very superficial knowledge of either\r\nlanguage would suffice to explain these allusions.\r\n\r\n[8] XVII. 17.\r\n\r\n[9] This is not Mithridates’s only title to distinction. Perhaps it may\r\nnot be so generally known that he was equally celebrated for his powers\r\nof eating and drinking! Athenæus tells of him that he once offered a\r\nprize of a talent to the greatest eater in his dominions. After a full\r\ncompetition the prize was awarded to Mithridates _himself_.—_Athenæus,\r\nDeipnosoph., Book X., p. 415._\r\n\r\n[10] VIII. 7.\r\n\r\n[11] Hist. Nat.

Histor. I. 943.\r\nThe legislation on the subject, however, was not uniform; nor is it easy\r\nto reconcile some parts of it with each other, or to understand any\r\ngeneral principles on which they can be founded.\r\n\r\n[15] Pænulus, act v., sc. 1.\r\n\r\n[16] With the exception of Tacitus, who claimed to be of the family of\r\nthe great historian, and made a vigorous but unsuccessful effort for the\r\nrevival of declining Latinity.\r\n\r\n[17] See Milman’s Latin Christianity, I., 28-9.\r\n\r\n[18] In some congregations, as early as the first and second century,\r\nthere were official interpreters [Ἑρμηνεύται], whose duty it was to\r\ntranslate into the provincial tongues, what had been read in the church.\r\nThey resembled the interpreters of the Jewish synagogue. See Neander’s\r\nKirchen-Geschichte, I. 530.\r\n\r\n[19] Stromata, I. 276 (Paris, 1641.)\r\n\r\n[20] Opp. I. 326 (Paris, 1609.) Hom. in Laudem St. Basilii.\r\n\r\n[21] See Bayle, Dict. Historique, I. 408. It is curious that the\r\nvictorious Mussulmen at Jerusalem enacted the very opposite. No Christian\r\nwas permitted to speak the sacred language of the Koran. See Milman’s\r\n“Latin Christianity,” II. 42, and again III. 225. It would be interesting\r\nto examine the history of enactments of this kind, and their effects upon\r\nthe languages which they were intended to suppress,—the Norman efforts\r\nagainst English, those of the English against Celtic, Joseph II’s against\r\nMagyar, and others of the same kind.\r\n\r\n[22] Ep. VI. 27.\r\n\r\n[23] When the Patriarch Nestorius wrote to Pope Celestine his account of\r\nthe controversy now known under his name, the latter was obliged, before\r\nhe could reply, to wait till Nestorius’s letter had been translated into\r\nLatin. Erat enim in Latinum sermo vertendus. This letter, together with\r\nthose of Cyril of Alexandria, form part of an interesting correspondence\r\nwhich illustrates very strikingly the pre-eminence then enjoyed in the\r\nChurch by the Roman bishop, and is found in Hardouin’s Concilia, I. 1302.\r\nSee also Walch’s Historie der Ketzereien, V. 701.\r\n\r\n[24] Even Pope Vigilius himself professes his want of familiarity with\r\nthe Greek language.

Concil. VII. 79. The writer\r\nobserves; Cum ab apostolorum tempore auditum non sit nec scriptum\r\nreperiatur, quemque ad populum eandem concionem habuisse tot ac tam\r\ndiversis linguis cuncta exponendo. The fact is also related by Feyjoo,\r\nTeatro critico, IV. p. 400. An interesting account of this remarkable\r\nscholar will be found in the _Bibliotheca Hispana Vetus_ II. _pp. 149-50_.\r\n\r\n[31] The Family of Barbaro produced many distinguished linguists,\r\naccording to the opportunities of the time. Francesco Barbaro, born in\r\n1398, was one of the earliest eminent Greek scholars of Italy. Ermolao,\r\nthe commentator on Aristotle, was said by the wits of his time to have\r\nbeen such a purist in Greek, that he did not stop at consulting the devil\r\nwhen he was at a loss for the precise meaning of a word—the much disputed\r\nἐντελεχέια of Aristotle!—See Bayle’s Dict. Hist. Art. _Barbaro_ I. 473.\r\n\r\n[32] Venice was long remarkable for her encouragement of skill in living\r\nlanguages. It was a necessary qualification for most of her diplomatic\r\nappointments; and, while Latin, in Europe, was still the ordinary medium\r\nof diplomatic intercourse, we find a Venetian ambassador to England, in\r\n1509, Badoer, capable of conversing like a native in English, French, and\r\nGerman.—See an interesting paper, “Venetian Dispatches,” in the Quarterly\r\nReview, vol. xcvi. p. 369.\r\n\r\n[33] M’Crie’s Reformation in Spain, I. p. 61.

A man apparently about fifty years old, named\r\nTinconi, a native of Constantinople, was found dead at his lodgings in\r\nthe Rue des Vieux Augustins, having perished, as it afterwards appeared,\r\nof hunger. This ill-fated man was possessed of an ample fortune, and had\r\nheld high diplomatic appointments; and, besides being well-versed in\r\nancient and modern literature, he spoke not fewer than ten languages,\r\nand knew several others! Yet almost the only record of his varied\r\naccomplishments is that which also tells the story of his melancholy end!\r\n\r\n[43] See his life by Pococke, prefixed to the translation of his work _De\r\nTermino Vitæ_. 1699.\r\n\r\n[44] See Dr. Paul De Lagarde’s learned dissertation, “De Geoponicon\r\nVersione Syriacâ” (p. 3, Leipsig, 1855). This dissertation is an account\r\nof a hitherto unknown Syriac version of the “Scriptores Rei Rusticæ”\r\nwhich Dr. De Lagarde discovered among the Syriac MSS. of the British\r\nMuseum. He has also transcribed from the same collection many similar\r\nremains of Syriac literature, partly sacred, partly profane, which he\r\npurposes to publish at intervals. Some of the former especially, as\r\nreferring to the Ante-Nicene period, are, like those already published\r\nby Mr. Cureton, of great interest to students of Christian antiquity,\r\nalthough the same drawback—doubt as to their age and authorship—must\r\naffect the doctrinal value of them all.\r\n\r\n[45] This laborious and prolific writer, whose works fill nearly 20\r\nvolumes, is said to have used the same pen for no less than forty\r\nyears, and to have been thrown almost into despair upon its accidental\r\ndestruction at the end of that period.\r\n\r\n[46] Some of these visited the English universities. Of one among the\r\nnumber, named Metrophanes Critopulus, who was sent by Cyrillus Lucaris\r\nto be indoctrinated in Anglican Theology, and who lived at Oxford at\r\nthe charge of archbishop Abbott, a very amusing account is given by the\r\ndisappointed prelate in a letter quoted by Neale (History of Alexandria,\r\nII., 413-5.) He turned out “an unworthy fellow,” “far from ingenuity\r\nor any grateful respect,” a “rogue and beggar,” and in other ways\r\ndisappointed the care bestowed on him.\r\n\r\n[47] One specimen may suffice, which is furnished by Mr. Neale:\r\n“_Collavi_ (_I have collated_) sua notata cum textu Bellarmini.” Neale,\r\nII., p. 402. The Easterns seldom seem at home in the languages of Europe;\r\nItalian, and still more French orthography, is their great puzzle. I have\r\nseen specimens of Oriental Italian which, for orthography, might rival\r\n“Jeames’s” English, or the French of Augustus the Strong.\r\n\r\n[48] Panagiotes was a native of Scio, and was known in his later life\r\nunder the sobriquet of “the Green Horse,” in allusion to a local proverb,\r\nthat “it is easier to find a green horse than a wise man in Scio.”\r\nThe appellation was the highest tribute that could be rendered to the\r\nprudence and ability of Panagiotes; but it is also a curious confirmation\r\nof the evil repute, as regards honesty, in which the islanders of the\r\nEgean were held from the earliest times. The reader will probably\r\nremember the satirical couplet of Phocylides about the honesty of the\r\nLerians, which Porson applied, in a well-known English parody, to the\r\nGreek scholarship of Herrmann.\r\n\r\n        ————Λέριοι κάκοι ὄυκ ὁ μὲν ὅστδ’ όυ\r\n    Πάντες πλήν Προκλέους και Πρόκλεης Λέριος.\r\n\r\n[49] An elaborate account of them will be found in Neumann’s _Versuch\r\neiner Geschichte der Armenischen Literatur_. Leipzig, 1836. On the\r\nexceeding importance of the Armenian language for the general study\r\nof the entire Indo-Germanic family, see the extremely learned essay,\r\n_Urgeschichte der Armenier, ein Philologischer Versuch_. (Berlin, 1854.)\r\nIt is published anonymously, but is believed to be from the pen of the\r\ndistinguished Orientalist named in page 22.\r\n\r\n[50] I do not think it necessary to mention (though he is a little\r\nearlier) Felix of Ragusa, the principal librarian, or rather book\r\ncollector, of Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary. He is said to have\r\nknown, besides Greek and Latin, the Chaldee, Arabic, and Syriac languages.\r\n\r\n[51] Sugli Uomini di gran Memoria, p. 27.\r\n\r\n[52] The history of this MS. is a strange one. In the sack of Pavia by\r\nthe French under Lautrec, it was carried off among the plunder. Teseo was\r\nin despair at the loss, and was returning to Rome with a sad heart. At\r\nFerrara, he chanced to see a quantity of papers at a charcoal burner’s,\r\njust on the point of being consigned to the furnace. What was his delight\r\nto find his precious Psalter among them! He began the printing of it at\r\nFerrara without delay, but did not live to see its completion.\r\n\r\n[53] Adelung’s Mithridates, I., 646. See also Biogr.

But I have\r\nnot been able to find any record of his skill in languages.\r\n\r\n[56] Thevet’s _Thresor des Langues_, p. 964.\r\n\r\n[57] Raimondi had spent many years in the East, and was acquainted\r\nwith most of the Oriental languages, living and dead. He projected\r\na polyglot bible which should contain the Arabic, Syriac, Persic,\r\nEthiopic, Armenian, and Coptic versions, accompanied by the Grammars and\r\nDictionaries of these languages. But the death of Gregory XIII., on whose\r\npatronage he mainly relied for the execution of his project, put a stop\r\nto the undertaking.\r\n\r\n[58] A copy of this work is found in the Catalogue of Cardinal\r\nMezzofanti’s Library, by Signor Bonifazi. It is in 4 vols., fol., Milan,\r\n1632.\r\n\r\n[59] Conciliatio Ecclesiæ Armenæ cum Romana, ex ipsis Armenorum Patrum\r\net Doctorum Testimoniis. 2 vols fol., Romæ 1658—It is in Bonifazi’s\r\nCatalogue of the Mezzofanti Library, p. 20.\r\n\r\n[60] Feller’s Dict.

He does not\r\nappear to have been a member of any of the Eastern missions. Angelo\r\nCanini, the eminent Syriac scholar, though born in Italy, belongs rather\r\nto the French school.\r\n\r\n[62] Wadding assigns his death to the year 1638; but it is clear from\r\nthe preface of the Thesaurus that he was dead several years before its\r\npublication, which was in 1636.\r\n\r\n[63] _Alcorani Textus Universus._ 2 vols, fol., Padua, 1698.\r\n\r\n[64] Biogr.

His Eminence added, that it was done\r\nas a mere amusement, and without the least effort or the remotest idea of\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\n[68] Through the kindness of the Cavaliere Pezzana, Royal Librarian and\r\nPrivy Councillor of Parma, I have been fortunate enough to obtain copies\r\nof some of Mezzofanti’s letters to De Rossi, which will be found in their\r\nchronological order hereafter.\r\n\r\n[69] It is a magnificent folio, entitled “Epithalamia Exoticis Linguis\r\nReddita;” one of the most curious productions of the celebrated press of\r\nBodoni. Parma, 1775.\r\n\r\n[70] The _Panglossia_ in honour of Peiresc was the work of many hands,\r\nand cannot fairly be compared with the Epithalamia of De Rossi. I have\r\nnever seen a copy of the latter, nor does De Rossi himself, in his modest\r\nautobiography, (_Memorie Storiche_, Parma, 1807, p. 19), enumerate the\r\nlanguages which it contained.\r\n\r\n[71] The ingenious mechanician, Prince Raimondo di Sansevero, of Naples,\r\nhad some name as a linguist. He is said to have known Latin, Greek,\r\nHebrew, Syriac, Arabic, and several modern languages. But his knowledge\r\nwas very superficial.\r\n\r\n[72] _Theatro Critico_, IV., p. 401, Art. _Glorias de España_.\r\n\r\n[73] _Bibliotheca Hispana_, Vol. IV., p. 75.\r\n\r\n[74] Thus amusingly “Englished” in Wanley’s “Wonders of the Little\r\nWorld,” p. 285:—\r\n\r\n    “A young man have I seen,\r\n    At twenty years so skilled,\r\n    That every art he knew, and all\r\n    In all degrees excelled!\r\n    Whatever yet was writ,\r\n    He vaunted to pronounce\r\n    (Like a young Antichrist) if he\r\n    Did read the same but once.”\r\n\r\n[75] P. 457.

Cologne, 1574.\r\n\r\n[76] Bruce’s Travels, III, 134.\r\n\r\n[77] Duret refers for some notice of Covilham, to the rare work of\r\nAlvarez, _De Historia Ethiopum_. In the hope of discovering something\r\nfurther regarding this remarkable and little-known linguist, I\r\nendeavoured to consult that author; but I have not been able to find a\r\ncopy. It is not in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[78] Galatinus de Arcanis Cath. Veritatis Libri XII.

Baillet says it was an edition of Seneca’s\r\nTragedies; but this is a mistake.

I. p. 207.\r\n\r\n[83] This is, strange as it may seem, the lowest computation, and rests\r\non _Lope de Vega’s_ own testimony, written in 1630, five years before his\r\ndeath. Speaking of the number of his dramatic fictions, he says to his\r\nfriend,\r\n\r\n    _Mil y quinientos_ fabulas admira.\r\n\r\nBy other authors the number is made much greater. According to some, as\r\nhis friend, Montalvan, he wrote _eighteen hundred_ plays; and Bouterwek,\r\nin his History of Spanish Literature, puts it down at the enormous\r\nestimate of _two thousand_. “_Spanish Literature_,” I. p. 361.\r\n\r\n[84] Montalvan says _four hundred_. The _Bibliotheca Hispana_ says (vol.\r\niv., p. 75) “_eighteen hundred plays, and above four hundred sacred\r\ndramas_.”\r\n\r\n[85] A long list of grammars, vocabularies, dictionaries, catechisms,\r\n&c., in more than forty-five different languages, compiled by the Spanish\r\nmissionaries, is given in the Bibliotheca Hispana, vol. IV. pp. 577-79.\r\n\r\n[86] M. d’Abbadie assures me that Father Paez is still spoken of as “Ma\r\nalim Petros” by the professors of Gondar and Bagënndir.\r\n\r\n[87] Neale’s _History of the Patriarchate of Alexandria_ (London, 1837)\r\nII. 405.\r\n\r\n[88] Letter to M. Le Leu de Wilhem, quoted by Neale, II. 402.\r\n\r\n[89] Biographie Universelle, IX. 301.\r\n\r\n[90] Of the latter work I have never seen the Italian original.

Madrid, 1800-5.\r\n\r\n[91] Anthony Rodolph Chevalier, a Hebraist of some eminence, born in\r\nNormandy in 1507, three years before Postel, has perhaps some claim to be\r\nmentioned before him, inasmuch as several of his versions are inserted in\r\nWalton’s Polyglot; but his history has hardly any interest.\r\n\r\n[92] See Adelung’s Mithridates, I. 646. Postel published in the same\r\nyear, the first grammar of the Arabic language ever printed. Paris 1558.\r\n\r\n[93] _Thresor de l’ Histoire de toutes les Langues de cet Univers._\r\nCologne, 613, p. 964.\r\n\r\n[94] Adelung, in the appendix of the first volume of his _Mithridates_,\r\nhas enumerated several other Pater Nosters, Thevet, Vulcanius (the\r\nlatinized form of _Smet_), Merula, Duret, Mauer Waser, Reuter, Witzen,\r\nBartsch, Bergmann, and others. None of these collections, however,\r\npossesses any special interest, as bearing on the present inquiry, nor\r\ndoes it appear that any of the authors was particularly eminent as a\r\nspeaker of languages; unless we are to presume that Thevet, Duret,\r\nGramaye, and Witzen, may, in their long travel or sojourn in foreign\r\ncountries, have acquired the languages of the nations among whom they\r\nlived. Of the last three names I shall say a few words hereafter.\r\n\r\n[95] A portion of the edition contains a Latin preface, explanatory of\r\nthe plan and contents; but the majority of the copies have this preface\r\nin Russian; and, in all, the character employed throughout the body of\r\nthe work is Russian. This character, however, may be mastered with so\r\nlittle difficulty, that, practically, its adoption can hardly be said\r\nto interfere materially with the usefulness of the work; and the use of\r\nthe Russian character had many advantages over the Roman, in accurately\r\nrepresenting the various sounds, especially those of the northern\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nAn alphabetical digest (4 vols. 4to. 1790-1) of all the words contained\r\nin the Vocabulary (arranged in the order of the alphabet without\r\nreference to language) was compiled, a few years later, by Theodor\r\nJankiewitsch de Miriewo, by which it may be seen at once to what language\r\neach word belongs. But this digest is described as unscientific in its\r\nplan and execution; and it was commonly believed that the Empress was so\r\ndissatisfied with it, that the work was suppressed and is now extremely\r\nrare; but I have been informed by Mr. Watts of the British Museum, that\r\ncopies of it are now not unfrequently offered for sale. A copy has been\r\nfor some years in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[96] It is true that some part of its materials have since become\r\nsuperannuated by the fuller and more accurate researches of later\r\ninvestigators, (see Bunsen’s Christianity and Mankind, III. 47.) But it\r\nis nevertheless a work even still of immense value.\r\n\r\n[97] Strange and incredible as this anecdote may seem, it is told\r\nseriously by Scaliger himself, who adds that the same extraordinary power\r\nwas possessed also by Jerome Cardan and by his father. See the curious\r\narticle in _Moreri_, _voce_ “Scaliger.”\r\n\r\n[98] Enfans Celebres, p. 196.\r\n\r\n[99] An equally eulogistic epigram, by Heinsius, is quoted by Hallam,\r\nLiterary History, II. 35.\r\n\r\n[100] Scaligeriana, p. 130.

I have seldom consulted it but with pleasure or profit. And the\r\nconcluding chapter, “on the language of animals and of birds,” on\r\nwhich great ridicule has been thrown, is in reality a very curious,\r\ninteresting, and judicious essay.\r\n\r\n[107] Mr. Kenrick, in the preface of his recent work on Phœnicia,\r\nconfesses that “the most diligent reader of ancient authors with a view\r\nto the illustration of Phœnician history, will find himself anticipated\r\nor surpassed by Bochart.”\r\n\r\n[108] Bochart’s death was the consequence of a fit with which he was\r\nseized during a vehement dispute which he had with Huet, in the academy\r\nof Caen in 1667, respecting the authenticity of some Spanish medals.\r\nHuet appears to have long felt the memory of it painfully. He alludes to\r\nit in a letter to his nephew, Piadore de Chersigne, above forty years\r\nafterwards; and seems to console himself by thinking that Bochart’s death\r\n“ne lui fut causèe par notre dispute, sinon en partie.” It is curious\r\nthat Disraeli has overlooked this in his “Quarrels of Authors.”\r\n\r\n[109] Feller’s Dict.

X. p. 476.\r\n\r\n[110] Perhaps I ought to mention Renaudot’s contemporary, the Jesuit,\r\nFather Claude Francis Menestrier, (1631-1704), who although not a great\r\nlinguist, is at least notable for the rather rare accomplishment of\r\nspeaking Greek with remarkable propriety and fluency, and still more for\r\nhis prodigious memory, which Queen Christina of Sweden tried by a very\r\nsingular ordeal. She had a string of three hundred words, the oddest\r\nand most unconnected that could be devised, written down without the\r\nleast order or connexion, and read over once in Menestrier’s presence.\r\nHe repeated them in their exact order, without a single mistake or\r\nhesitation!—_Biographie Univ., Vol. XXVIII._, _p._ 293.\r\n\r\nA still more extraordinary example of this power of memory is related\r\nby Padre Menocchio (the well-known Biblical commentator, Menochius) of\r\na young Corsican whom Muret met at Padua, and who was not only able\r\nto repeat in their regular order a jumble of words similar to that\r\ndescribed above, but could repeat them _backwards, and with various other\r\nmodifications_! The youth assured Muret that he could retain in this way\r\n36,000 words, and that he would undertake to keep them in memory for an\r\nentire year! See Menocchio’s _Stuore_, Part III., p. 89. The _Stuore_\r\nis a miscellaneous collection, compiled by this learned Jesuit during\r\nhis hours of recreation. He called the work by this quaint title (Ang.\r\n“_Mats_”) in allusion to the habit of the ancient monks, who used to\r\nemploy their leisure hours in weaving _mats_, in the literal sense of\r\nthe word. This fanciful title is not unlike that chosen by Clement of\r\nAlexandria for a somewhat similar miscellany, his Στρώματα [Tapestry], or\r\nperhaps the more literal one “Patchwork,” assumed by a popular writer of\r\nour own time.\r\n\r\n[111] Many of the French missionaries in China, of course, were\r\ndistinguished Chinese scholars. The Dictionary of Pere Amiot, for\r\nexample, although not published till after his death, is still a standard\r\nwork. It was edited by Langlés in 1789-90.\r\n\r\n[112] For instance his _Memoire dans le quel on prouve que les Chinois\r\nsont une Colonie Egyptienne_; a notion which was warmly controverted by\r\nhis fellow pupil, Deshauterayes. De Guignes argues from the supposed\r\nresemblance of the Chinese and Phœnician characters. His great Chinese\r\nDictionary, with Klaproth’s supplement, (2 vols. fol., Paris, 1813-19) is\r\nin Mezzofanti’s Catalogue, p. 6.\r\n\r\n[113] Although of French parents, Ruffin was born in 1742 at Salonica,\r\nwhere his father was living in the capacity of chief interpreter of\r\nFrance.

He died in 1806, before he had completed his\r\ntwenty-fourth year.\r\n\r\n[117] M. Eugene Borè has been in Armenia what the two D’Abbadies have\r\nbeen in Abyssinia—at once a scholar and a missionary—the pioneer of\r\nreligion and civilization, no less than of science.\r\n\r\n[118] I gladly avail myself of this opportunity to acknowledge the\r\nvaluable assistance on many points which I have received, in the form\r\nboth of information and of suggestion, at the hands of this distinguished\r\nphilologist and traveller.

His Swedish version of the old Finnic\r\nSaga “Kalevala,” is perhaps deserving of notice as having furnished in\r\nits metre the model of the new English measure adopted by Longfellow in\r\nhis recent poem “Hiawatha.” Castrén’s birth-place is close to Uleåborg,\r\nthe spot resorted to commonly by travellers who desire to witness the\r\nphenomenon of “the Midnight Sun.”\r\n\r\n[158] Bunsen, III., p. 274.\r\n\r\n[159] Bunsen, III., p. 53.\r\n\r\n[160] Ibid, 270.\r\n\r\n[161] In his “Comparative Grammar of the Drâvidian or South-Indian Family\r\nof Languages.”\r\n\r\n[162] The fiercest of them all is contained not in the Journal, but in a\r\npamphlet which was distributed to members of the Society.\r\n\r\n[163] Dr. Paul De Lagarde, for instance, has the reputation of knowing\r\nabove twenty languages.\r\n\r\n[164] Christianity and Mankind, III., 271.\r\n\r\n[165] Knight’s Cyclopædia of Biography, I. 450-3.\r\n\r\n[166] Cancellieri, Sugli Uomini di gran Memoria, e sugli Uomini\r\nsmemorati, p. 50-1.\r\n\r\n[167] Life of James Crichton of Cluny, commonly called “the Admirable\r\nCrichton.” Edinburgh, 1819.\r\n\r\n[168] _Wonders of the Little World_, p. 286.\r\n\r\n[169] II., p. 223.\r\n\r\n[170] “New Atlantis.” Bacon’s Works, II., 84.\r\n\r\n[171] Life of Edward Lord Clarendon, I., p. 35.\r\n\r\n[172] Literary History, II., 85.\r\n\r\n[173] Church History, III., 87.\r\n\r\n[174] Disraeli’s Miscellanies, p. 131.\r\n\r\n[175] Ibid.\r\n\r\n[176] Rose’s Biographical Dictionary, XI., 166.\r\n\r\n[177] Disraeli’s Miscellanies, p. 131.\r\n\r\n[178] Wilkins was an eminent mathematician, and one of the first members\r\nof the Royal Society. But his reputation as a humourist was his chief\r\nrecommendation to Buckingham. His character in many respects resembled\r\nthat of Swift. One of his witticisms is worth recording. After the first\r\nappearance of his well-known Voyage to the Moon [“Discovery of a New\r\nWorld, with a Discourse concerning the Possibility of a Voyage thither”],\r\nthe eccentric Duchess of Newcastle jestingly remarked to him that the\r\nonly defect in his account was that it omitted to tell where the voyagers\r\nwould find lodging and accommodation by the way. “That need present no\r\ndifficulty to your Grace,” said Wilkins; “you have built so many _castles\r\nin the air_ that _you_ cannot be at any loss for accommodation on the\r\njourney.”\r\n\r\n[179] He published the “Pantheisticon,” the most profane of all his\r\nworks, under this pseudonym. I regret to see that an elaborate attempt\r\nto recall this long-forgotten book into notice, is made by Dr. Hermann\r\nHettner, in his “Geschichte der Englischen Literatur von 1660 bis 1770,”\r\nthe first volume of which has just been published at Leipsic (1856). Dr.\r\nHettner has even been at the pains to translate largely from its worst\r\nprofanities.\r\n\r\n[180] Disraeli’s Miscellanies, p. 110.\r\n\r\n[181] Among the crowd of bubble companies which arose about the time\r\nof the Revolution, was the “Royal Academies Company,” which professed\r\nto have engaged the best masters in every department of knowledge, and\r\nissued 20,000 tickets at twenty shillings each. The fortunate holders\r\nwere to be taught at the charge of the company! Among the subjects of\r\ninstruction languages held a high place; and the scheme of education\r\ncomprised Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, and Spanish! See Macaulay’s\r\nHistory of England, IV., 307.\r\n\r\n[182] Disraeli has a curious chapter on Henley, _Miscellanies_, pp. 73-8.\r\n\r\n[183] A plan for the promotion of Oriental studies, under the patronage\r\nof the Company, formed one of the many magnificent schemes of Warren\r\nHastings, himself no mean linguist. Hastings consulted Johnson on the\r\nsubject; and it is observed as an evidence of his extraordinary coolness\r\nand self-possession, that his letter, acknowledging Johnson’s present\r\nof Sir W. Jones’s Persian Grammar, was written in the midst of the\r\nexcitement of one of the most eventful days in his chequered life. See\r\nCroker’s Boswell’s Life of Johnson.

In two successive pamphlets which he\r\npublished in the course of a controversy which he carried on with his\r\ngreat rival, Podestà (who was professor of Arabic in the University) he\r\nwent to the pains of actually _transcribing with his own hand in each\r\ncopy_ the quotations from Oriental authors, as there were no Oriental\r\ntypes in Vienna from which they could be printed! Meninski’s Thesaurus,\r\nhowever, is best known from the learned edition of it which was printed\r\nat Vienna (1780-1802) under the revision of Baron von Ienisch, himself\r\nan Orientalist of very high reputation, and for a considerable time\r\ninterpreter of the Austrian embassy at Constantinople.\r\n\r\n[230] Literature of Slavonic Nations, 270.

The example and patronage of Frederic tended much to promote\r\nthe revival of Oriental studies. Many of the earliest versions of the\r\nworks of Aristotle from the Arabic, were made under his auspices or those\r\nof his son Manfred; among others (compare Jourdain’s “Recherches sur\r\nles Traductions Latines d’Aristote,” p. 124, Paris 1843; also Whewell’s\r\n“History of the Inductive Sciences,” I., p. 343;) that of Sir Michael\r\nScott of Balwearie, a learned Orientalist and an accomplished general\r\nscholar, although his traditionary character is that of “the wizard\r\nMichael Scott.” His namesake, Sir Walter, has immortalized him, not as a\r\nscholar, but as\r\n\r\n    “A wizard of such dreaded fame,\r\n    That when, in Salamanca’s cave,\r\n    Him listed his magic wand to wave\r\n    The bells would ring in Notre Dame!”\r\n\r\nRoger Bacon’s skill in Arabic and other Eastern tongues was probably one\r\nof the causes which drew upon him the same evil reputation.

He was “an\r\nindustrious student of Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, and the modern tongues.”\r\n(Milman’s Latin Christianity, VI., p. 477). Perhaps I ought also to have\r\nnamed Albert the Great (Ibid., p. 453); but I am rather disposed to\r\nbelieve that the knowledge which he had of Hebrew, Chaldee, and Arabic\r\nauthors, was derived from Latin versions, and not from the original works\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n[237] Gerbert travelled to Spain with the express purpose of studying in\r\nthe Arabian schools.

His birth therefore must be assigned to 1750.\r\n\r\n[259] Cancellieri, pp. 84-7.\r\n\r\n[260] The learned patristical scholar, John Baptist Cotelier,\r\n(Cotelerius,) is another example of precocious development leading to\r\nsolid fruit. At twelve years of age Cotelier could read and translate\r\nfluently any part of the Bible that was opened for him! I may also recall\r\nhere the case of Dr. Thomas Young, of whom I have already spoken. His\r\nearly feat of reading the entire Bible twice through before he was four\r\nyears old, is hardly less wonderful than any of those above recorded. See\r\nNational Review, vol. II. p. 69.\r\n\r\n[261] A vocalist, named H. K. von Freher, has appeared recently, who\r\nadvertises _to sing_ in thirty-six different languages! He is a native\r\nof Hungary. With how many of these languages, however, he professes to\r\nbe acquainted, and what degree of familiarity he claims with each, I am\r\nunable to say; but he is described in the public journals as “speaking\r\nEnglish with purity;” and in one of his latest performances he favoured\r\nthe audience with “portions of songs in no less than three or four\r\nand twenty different languages, commencing with a Russian hymn, and\r\nproceeding on with a French romance, a Styrian song, a Polish air, which\r\nhe screeched most amusingly, a Sicilian song, as dismal as the far-famed\r\nVespers of that country, a Canadian ditty, a Hungarian serenade, a\r\nMaltese air, a Bavarian, a Neapolitan barcarole, a Hebrew psalm, a\r\nTyrolean air, in which the rapid changes from the basso profondo to the\r\nfalsetto had a most singular effect.”\r\n\r\n[262] The title of this singular volume is worth transcribing: “Coryat’s\r\nCrudities, hastily gobbled up in five months’ Travels in France, Savoy,\r\nItaly, Rhetia, (commonly called the Grisons’ Country), Helvetia, alias\r\nSwitzerland, some parts of High Germany, and the Netherlands; newly\r\ndigested in the hungry air of Odcombe in the county of Somersetshire,\r\nand now dispersed to the Nourishment of the travelling Members of this\r\nKingdom.” 4to. London, 1611. It is further noticeable in this place for a\r\npolyglot appendix of quizzical verses in Greek, Latin, Spanish, Italian,\r\nFrench, Welsh, Irish, Macaronic, and Utopian, “by various hands.”\r\n\r\n[263] 1 vol. 12mo, printed at Strawberry Hill, 1758, and re-printed in\r\nDodsley’s Collections, 1761.\r\n\r\n[264] This name was afterwards the subject of a punning epigram.\r\nMezzofanti is a compound word, (like the names Mezzaharba, Mezzavacca.\r\nMezzomorto, &c.,) and means _half-child_, [Mezzo-Fante.] Hence the\r\nfollowing distich:—\r\n\r\n    _Dimidium Fantis_ jam nunc supereminct omnes!\r\n    Quid, credis, fieret, si _integer_ ipse foret?\r\n\r\n[265] In the Via Malcontenti. The house still exists, but has been\r\nentirely remodelled. An inscription for the apartment in which Mezzofanti\r\nwas born was composed by D. Vincenzo Mignani:—\r\n\r\n    Heic Mezzofantus natus, notissimus Orbi,\r\n    Unus qui linguas calluit omnigenas.\r\n\r\nSome years later Francis Mezzofanti removed to a house on the opposite\r\nside of the same street, in which he thenceforward continued to reside.\r\nThis house also is still in existence, but has been modernized. In the\r\nearly part of the year 1800, Mezzofanti established himself, together\r\nwith the family of his sister, Signora Minarelli, in a separate\r\nhouse, situated however in the same street: but, from the time of his\r\nappointment as Librarian, in 1815, till his final removal to Rome, he\r\noccupied the Librarian’s apartments in the Palazzo Dell’ Università.\r\n\r\n[266] There has been some diversity of statement as to the year. The\r\n_Enciclopedia Popolare_ (Turin 1851, supp. p. 299,) hesitates between\r\n1774 and 1771. But there can be no doubt that it was the former.\r\n\r\n[267] He merely learned to read and write.\r\n\r\n[268] Antonio Dall’ Olmo was a professor in the University so far back as\r\n1360. See Tiraboschi, “Letteratura Italiana,” V. p. 56.\r\n\r\n[269] Mingarelli has been a distinguished name in Bolognese letters. The\r\ntwo brothers, Ferdinand and John Lewis, were among the most diligent\r\npatristical students of the last century. To the latter (of whom I shall\r\nhave to speak hereafter,) we are indebted for a learned edition of\r\nthe lost Περὶ Tρiάδος of the celebrated Didymus, the blind teacher of\r\nAlexandria; the former also is spoken of with high praise by Tiraboschi,\r\nVII., 1073. This family, however, is different from that of Minarelli,\r\nwith which Mezzofanti was connected.\r\n\r\n[270] No fewer than eleven sons and four daughters. Of the sons only\r\ntwo are now living—the Cavaliere Pietro Minarelli, who is a physician\r\nand member of the Medical Faculty of Bologna, and the Cavaliere\r\nGaetano, an advocate and notary. A third son, Giuseppe, embraced the\r\necclesiastical profession in which he rose to considerable distinction.\r\nHe was a linguist of some reputation, being acquainted with no fewer\r\nthan eight languages, (see the _Cantica di G. Morocco_, p. 12, note,)\r\nan accomplishment which he owed mainly to the instruction of his uncle.\r\nSome time after the departure of the latter for Rome, Giuseppe was named\r\nRector of the University of Bologna, and honorary Domestic Prelate of\r\nthe Pope Gregory XVI., but he died at a comparatively early age in\r\n1843. A fourth son, Filippo, became an architect, but was disabled by a\r\nparalytic attack from prosecuting his studies, and died after a lingering\r\nand painful illness, July 23rd, 1839. The other sons died in childhood.\r\nThe four daughters, Maria, Anna, Gesualda, and Gertrude, still survive.\r\nMaria and Gertrude married—the first, Signor Mazzoli, the second,\r\nSignor Calori—and are now widows. Anna and Gesualda are unmarried. The\r\nformer resided with her uncle, from the time of his elevation to the\r\ncardinalate till his death. She is said to be an accomplished painter in\r\nwater-colours. Her sister, Gesualda, is an excellent linguist.\r\n\r\n[271] I take the earliest opportunity to express my most grateful\r\nacknowledgment of the exceeding courtesy, not only of the Cavaliere\r\nMinarelli and other members of Cardinal Mezzofanti’s family, but of many\r\nother gentlemen of Bologna, Parma, Modena, Florence, Rome, and Naples.\r\nI must mention with especial gratitude the Abate Mazza, Vice-Rector of\r\nthe Pontifical Seminary, at Bologna; Cavaliere Angelo Pezzana, Librarian\r\nof the Ducal Library, at Parma; Cavaliere Cavedoni, Librarian of Modena;\r\nProfessor Guasti at Florence; Padre Bresciani, the distinguished author\r\nof the “Ebreo di Verona,” at Rome; the Rector and Vice-Rector of the\r\nIrish College, and the Rector and Vice-Rector of the English College in\r\nthe same city; and Padre Vinditti of the Jesuit College at Naples. For\r\nsome personal recollections of Mezzofanti and his early friends, and for\r\nother interesting information obtained from Bologna, I am indebted to\r\nDr. Santagata, to Mgr. Trombetti, and to the kind offices of the learned\r\nArchbishop of Tarsus, Mgr. De Luca, Apostolic Nuncio at Munich.\r\n\r\n[272] This anecdote was told to Cardinal Wiseman by the late Archdeacon\r\nHare, as current in Bologna during the residence of his family in\r\nthat city. The Archdeacon’s brother, Mr. Francis Hare, was intimately\r\nacquainted with Mezzofanti during his early life, and was for some time\r\nhis pupil.\r\n\r\n[273] Headley’s “Letters from Italy,” pp. 152-3.\r\n\r\n[274] Ibid, p. 152.\r\n\r\n[275] He published a number of polemical and moral treatises, which are\r\nenumerated in the “Memorie di Religione,” a journal published at Modena,\r\nvol IV., pp. 456-61, where will also be found an interesting memoir of\r\nthe author.\r\n\r\n[276] Another name, Molina, is mentioned, as one of his early masters,\r\nin a rude poetical panegyric of the Cardinal, by an improvisatore named\r\nGiovanni Masocco:—“Per la illustre e sempre cara Memoria del Card.\r\nGiuseppe Mezzofanti,” [Roma 1849]. But I have not learned any particulars\r\nregarding this Molina.\r\n\r\n[277] This at least was Thiulen’s ordinary department. See the _Memorie\r\ndi Religione_, already cited.\r\n\r\n[278] _Esquisse Historique sur le Cardinal Mezzofanti. Par A. Manavit._\r\nParis, 1853, p. 15.\r\n\r\n[279] See the _Memorie di Religione_, vol. XV., where an interesting\r\nbiography of the Abate Ranzani will be found.\r\n\r\n[280] Manavit, “Esquisse Historique,” p. 9.\r\n\r\n[281] Ibid, p. 12.\r\n\r\n[282] Manavit assigns a much later date, 1791. But the short memoir\r\nby Signor Stoltz, [Biografia del Cardinal Mezzofanti; Scritta dall’\r\nAvvocato G. Stoltz, Roma 1851,] founded upon information supplied by the\r\nCardinal’s family, which states that he had completed his philosophy\r\nwhen he was but fifteen, (p. 6,) is much more reconcilable with facts\r\notherwise ascertained. His philosophical course occupied three years.\r\n(See _De Josepho Mezzofantio, Sermones Duo auctore Ant. Santagata_,\r\npublished in the acts of the Institute of Bologna, vol. V. p. 169, et\r\nseq.) His theological course (probably of four,) was completed in 1796,\r\nor at farthest early in 1797. This would clearly have been impossible in\r\nthe interval assigned by Manavit.\r\n\r\n[283] One of these, _Reflessioni sul Manuale dei Teofilantropi_,\r\nis directed against the singular half-religious, half-social\r\nconfederation, entitled “Theophilanthropists,” founded in 1795, by La\r\nReveillere-Lepéaux, one of the directors of the French Republic. These\r\ntreatises are noticed in the _Memorie di Religione_, 1822, 1823, and\r\n1824. Joseph Voglio is not to be confounded with the physiologist of the\r\nsame name, (John Hyacinth,) who was also professor in Bologna, but in the\r\nprevious generation.\r\n\r\n[284] “De Josepho Mezzofantio Sermones Duo,” p. 172.\r\n\r\n[285] Manavit, p. 13.\r\n\r\n[286] Santagata’s “Sermones Duo,” p. 173.\r\n\r\n[287] Elementi della Lingua Greca, per uso delle Scuole di Bologna.\r\nBologna 1807.\r\n\r\n[288] See Kephalides “Reise durch Italien und Sicilien.” Vol. I. p. 29.\r\n\r\n[289] See two interesting articles in the “Historisch-Politische\r\nBlätter,” vol. X. p. 200, and folio. The writer was the younger Görres,\r\n(Guido,) son of the well-known professor of that name. Most of his\r\ninformation as to the early life of Mezzofanti was derived from the\r\nCardinal himself, with whom, during a long sojourn in Rome, in 1841-2, he\r\nformed a very close and intimate friendship, and in company with whom he\r\nstudied the Basque language. I have spoken of Mingarelli in a former page.\r\n\r\n[290] Manavit, p. 17.\r\n\r\n[291] Santagata, p. 171.\r\n\r\n[292] “Memorie di Religione,” vol.

Mezzofanti was more fortunate in this experiment\r\nthan the Frenchman mentioned in Moore’s “Diary,” (vol. VI., p. 190,) who,\r\nafter he had taken infinite pains to learn a language which he _believed\r\nto be Swedish_, discovered, at the end of his studies, that the language\r\nwhich he had acquired with so much labour was _Bas-Breton_.\r\n\r\n[294] M. Manavit (p. 19,) says, that he was at this time _twenty-two\r\nyears_ old. But this is an error of a full year. He was born on the\r\n17th September, 1774; and therefore, before September 24th, 1797, had\r\ncompleted his twenty-third year. M. Manavit was probably misled by\r\nthe dispensation in age which was obtained for him. But it must be\r\nrecollected that such dispensation is required for all candidates for\r\npriesthood under _twenty-four years_ complete.\r\n\r\n[295] This date, and the others relating to his university career, have\r\n(through the kindness of the Nuncio at Munich, Mgr. De Luca,) been\r\nextracted for me from an autograph note, deposited by Mezzofanti himself\r\nin the archives of the university of Bologna, on the 25th of April, 1815.\r\n\r\n[296] Santagata, Sermones, p. 190.\r\n\r\n[297] Manavit, p. 28.\r\n\r\n[298] Whewell’s Inductive Sciences, III. p. 86.\r\n\r\n[299] Manavit, p. 19.\r\n\r\n[300] Ibid, p. 29.\r\n\r\n[301] The learned and munificent Egidio Albornoz, whom English readers\r\nprobably know solely from the revolting picture in Bulwer’s “Rienzi.”\r\nThe Albornoz College was founded in pursuance of his will, in 1377, with\r\nan endowment for twenty-four Spanish students, and two chaplains.

Some students,\r\nlike those named above, and others who might easily have been added;—as\r\nthe celebrated Père Hardouin; or the ill-fated Robert Heron, who died in\r\nNewgate in 1807, and who for many years had spent from twelve to sixteen\r\nhours a day at his desk [Disraeli, p. 84];—place no limit to the time of\r\nstudy beyond that of the student’s physical powers of endurance. On the\r\nother hand, Sir Matthew Hale (see Southey’s Life, IV., 357) said that six\r\nhours a day were as much as any student could usefully bear; and even\r\nLord Coke was fully satisfied with eight. Much, of course, must depend\r\non the individual constitution; but of the two opinions the latter is\r\ncertainly nearer the truth.\r\n\r\n[317] In “Lettere di Varii illustri Itali, del Secolo XVII., e del\r\nSecolo XVIII.” Vol. III., p. 183.

I am indebted for the\r\nknowledge of the book (which is now rare) to Mr. Garnett of the British\r\nMuseum. A tolerably full account of it may be found in the _Bibliothèque\r\nUniverselle de Genêve_ (a continuation of the _Bibliothèque Britannique_)\r\nvol. VIII., pp. 388-408.\r\n\r\n[320] A similar narrative was published as late as 1817 by Pananti.\r\n“Avventure ed Osservazioni sopra le Coste di Barberia.” Firenze 1817. It\r\nwas translated into English by Mr. Blacquiere, and published in 1819.\r\nIn the end of the seventeenth century, France and England severally\r\ncompelled the Dey of Algiers to enter into treaties by which their\r\nsubjects were protected from these piratical outrages; and in the\r\nfollowing century, the increasing naval power of the other great European\r\nstates tended to secure for them a similar immunity. But the weaker\r\nmaritime states of the Mediterranean, especially Naples, Sicily, and\r\nSardinia, were still exposed not only to attacks upon their vessels at\r\nsea, but even to descents upon their shores, in which persons of every\r\nage and sex were carried off and sold into slavery. The long wars of\r\nthe Revolution secured a sort of impunity for these outrages, which at\r\nlength reached such a height, that when, in 1816, the combined English\r\nand Dutch squadron under Lord Exmouth destroyed the arsenal and fleet\r\nof Algiers, the number of Christian captives set at liberty was no less\r\nthan ten hundred and eighty-three. Nevertheless even still the evil was\r\nnot entirely abated; nor can the secure navigation of the Mediterranean\r\nbe said to have been completely established till the final capture of\r\nAlgiers by the French under Duperre and Bourmont, in 1830.\r\n\r\n[321] In virtue of a treaty made in 1683, after the memorable bombardment\r\nof Algiers by Admiral Du Quesne.\r\n\r\n[322] The Moorish form of the common Arabic name _Tezkerah_, [in Egypt,\r\n(see Burton’s “Medinah and Meccah,” I. 26.) Tazkirêh] of a passport. The\r\nMoorish Arabic differs considerably (especially in the vowel sounds,)\r\nfrom the common dialect of the East. Caussin de Percival’s Grammar\r\ncontains both dialects, and a special Grammar of Moorish Arabic was\r\npublished at Vienna by Dombay, of which Mezzofanti was already possessed\r\n(inf. 178.) Both the Grammars named above are in the Mezzofanti Library.\r\n_Catalogo_, pp. 14 and 17. Father Caronni gives a fac-simile of a portion\r\nof the _Tiscara_.\r\n\r\n[323] Sidi Hamudah had been Bey of Tunis from the year 1782, when he\r\nsucceeded his brother, Ali Bey. He survived till 1815. His reign is\r\ndescribed as the Augustan age of Tunis (Diary of a Tour in Barbary,\r\nII. 79). Father Caronni tells of him that when one of his generals,—a\r\nChristian,—was about to become a Mahomedan in the hope of ingratiating\r\nhimself with Hamudah, he rebuked the renegade for his meanness. “A hog,”\r\nsaid he, “remains always a hog in my eyes, even though he has lost his\r\ntail.”\r\n\r\n[324] This month is called in the common Arabic of Egypt _Gumada_. There\r\nare two of the Mahomedan months called by this name, _Gumada-l-Oola_, and\r\n_Gumada-t-Taniyeh_ (Lane’s Modern Egyptians, I. 330). The latter, which\r\nis the sixth month of the year, is the one meant here. As the Mahomedan\r\nyear consists of only three hundred and fifty days, it is hardly\r\nnecessary to say that its months do not permanently correspond with those\r\nof our year. They retrograde through the several seasons during a cycle\r\nof thirty-three years.\r\n\r\n[325] The year of the Hegira, 1219, corresponds with A.D. 1804.\r\n\r\n[326] Ragguaglio del Viaggio, vol.

I\r\nshould say however, that some of his classics,—especially his “Virgilii\r\nOpera,” although beautiful specimens of typography, have but little\r\ncritical reputation.\r\n\r\n[330] “Grammatica Linguæ Mauro-Arabicæ, juxta vernaculi Idiomatis Usum.”\r\n4to.

The vertebral column is the pile: the liver is\r\nthe negative, the bladder, the positive pole.” See Whewell’s Inductive\r\nSciences, III. 87.\r\n\r\n[335] For instance among the books which he asks the Count in this\r\nletter to send, are the works of “_l’immortale Haüy_”—the celebrated\r\nAbbé Haüy, who after Romè de l’Isle, is the founder of the science of\r\nCrystallography, and who at this time was at the height of his brilliant\r\ncareer of discovery. (Whewell’s “Inductive Sciences” III. 222.) Haüy’s\r\nworks were intended for his friend Ranzani.\r\n\r\n[336] He alludes to the _Bibliotheca Orientalis Clementino-Vaticana_.\r\nJoseph Assemani’s nephew, Stephen Evodius, compiled a catalogue of the\r\nOriental MSS. at Florence.\r\n\r\n[337] The exact title is “Geschichte der Scherifen, oder der Könige des\r\njetzt regierendes Hauses zu Marokko.” It was published, not at Vienna, as\r\nthis letter supposes, but at Agram, in 1801.\r\n\r\n[338] A Moorish physician of Cordova, in the twelfth century, variously\r\ncalled _Albucasa_, _Buchasis_, _Bulcaris_, _Gafar_; but properly _Abul\r\nCassem Khalaf Ben Abbas_.

I refer to this passage\r\nparticularly, as explaining the peculiar difficulty which Wallachian, as\r\na spoken language, presents to a foreigner, from _its close resemblance\r\nto other languages_.\r\n\r\n[368] Manavit, p. 37.\r\n\r\n[369] Besides the _Sette Communi_ of Vicenza, there are also\r\nthirteen parishes in the province of Verona, called the _Tredici\r\nCommuni_;—evidently of the same Teutonic stock, and a remnant of the same\r\nRoman slaughter. Adelung (II., 215) gives a specimen of each language.\r\nBoth are perfectly intelligible to any German scholar: but that of\r\nVerona resembles more nearly the modern form of the German language.\r\nThe affinity is much more closely preserved in both, than it is in\r\nthe analogous instance of the Roman colony in Transylvania. I may be\r\npermitted to refer to the very similar example of an isolated race and\r\nlanguage which subsisted _among ourselves_ down to the last generation,\r\nin the Baronies of Forth and Bargie in the county of Wexford in Ireland.\r\nThe remnant of the first English or Welsh adventurers under Strongbow,\r\nwho obtained lands in that district, maintained themselves, through\r\na long series of generations, distinct in manners, usages, costume,\r\nand even language, both from the Irish population, and, what is more\r\nremarkable, from the _English settlers of all subsequent periods_.\r\nAn essay on their peculiar dialect, with a vocabulary and a metrical\r\nspecimen, by Vallancey, will be found in the Transactions of the Royal\r\nIrish Academy, Vol. II.

In reply Mr. Harford assured me\r\nthat he himself heard Mezzofanti _speak_ Welsh at his first visit to\r\nBologna, in 1817.\r\n\r\n[376] Letters from the North of Italy, Vol. II., p. 54.\r\n\r\n[377] See Life, IV., p. 32. He had not visited Bologna in the interval.\r\n\r\n[378] Perhaps it might be inferred from the false spelling of the\r\nname—the use of _ph_ for _f_—(a blunder which violates so fundamental a\r\nrule of Italian orthography as to betray a mere tyro in the study) that\r\nthis passage was penned soon after Byron’s arrival in Italy. But Byron’s\r\northography was never a standard.\r\n\r\n[379] Manavit, p. 106.\r\n\r\n[380] Life and Works, IV., 262-3. It may be worth while to note this\r\ncurious and characteristic passage, as an example of what Byron has\r\nbeen so often charged with—unacknowledged, (and perhaps unconscious)\r\nplagiarisms from authors or works which are but little known. The idea of\r\n“a universal interpreter at the time of the tower of Babel,” is copied\r\nliterally from Pope’s metrical version of the second satire of Dr. Donne,\r\nto the hero of which the same illustration is applied, in exactly the\r\nsame way.\r\n\r\n    “Thus others’ talents having nicely shown,\r\n    He came by sure transition to his own;\r\n    Till I cried out: ‘You prove yourself so able,\r\n    _Pity you was not druggerman_ [dragoman] _at Babel!_\r\n    For had they found a linguist half so good,\r\n    I make no question but the Tower had stood.’”\r\n\r\n[381] Yet not without foundation in fact. My friend Mr. James E. Doyle,\r\nwas assured by the late Dr. Charles R. Walsh (an English surgeon of great\r\nability, who fell a victim to his exertions as an officer of the Board of\r\nHealth, during the last cholera in London), that he once heard Mezzofanti\r\n“doing” the slang of a London cabman in great perfection.\r\n\r\n[382] Gaume, “Les Trois Rome,” II., p. 415.\r\n\r\n[383] Santagata, “Sermones Duo,” p. 11.\r\n\r\n[384] Santagata, pp. 19-20.\r\n\r\n[385] Bologna, 1820.—It was on the occasion of the celebration of\r\nFather Aponte’s “Jubilee”—the fiftieth anniversary of his ordination as\r\npriest—that Mezzofanti addressed to him the Hebrew Psalm which will be\r\nfound in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n[386] Reise durch Italien, I. p. 30-2.\r\n\r\n[387] Biographie Universelle (Brussels Edition), XIX., 50-1.\r\n\r\n[388] Italy, I., 292.\r\n\r\n[389] Lady Morgan’s Italy, Vol. I., p. 200.\r\n\r\n[390] This was not a mere joke. The Bolognese dialect has so many\r\npeculiarities that, at least by any other than an Italian, it might well\r\ndeserve to be specially enumerated as a distinct acquisition. It has even\r\na kind of literature of its own;—a comedy of the 16th century, entitled\r\n_Filolauro_; a version of the _Gerusalemme Liberata_; and several other\r\nworks named by Adelung (II., 514). The Bolognese Pater Noster is as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n“Pader noster, ch’ si in cil, si pur santifica al voster nom; vegna ’l\r\nvoster reyn; sia fatta la vostra volontà, com in cil, cosi in terra; ’l\r\nnoster pan quotidian daz incu; e perdonaz i noster debit, sicom no alteri\r\nperdonen ai noster debitur; en c’indusi in Tentazion; ma liberaz da mal.\r\nAmen.” Adelung, II., 515.\r\n\r\n[391] Molbech’s Reise giennem en Deel af Tydskland, Frankrige England, og\r\nItalien, i Aarene 1819 og 1820, vol. iii. p. 319, and following.\r\n\r\n[392] The _Danske Ordbog_; first published in Copenhagen in 1833.

On returning to England, the\r\nadmiral gave this copy to the Rev. Dr. William Pearson, then engaged\r\nin the publication of his elaborate work on Practical Astronomy. Dr.\r\nPearson, (at p. 495 of the first volume,) describing a table of 520\r\nzodiacal stars, thus acknowledges his obligations to that work. “The same\r\npage also contains the N.E. angle that the star’s meridian makes with the\r\necliptic, and the annual variation of that angle; the principal columns\r\nof which have been taken from the _Bononiæ Ephemerides_ for 1817-1822,\r\ncomputed by Pietro Caturegli, which computations have greatly facilitated\r\nour labours.”\r\n\r\n[403] Borrow’s Gipsies in Spain, p. 240. Ample specimens and descriptions\r\nof it are given by Adelung, vol. I. pp. 244-52. It may, perhaps, be\r\nnecessary to add that neither of these dialects, nor indeed of any of the\r\ndialects used by European gipsies, bears the least resemblance (although\r\noften confounded with it) to the “thieves’ slang,” which is used by\r\nrobbers and other _mauvais sujets_ in various countries,—the “Rothwälsch”\r\n(Red Italian) of Germany, the “Argot” of France, the “Germania” of\r\nSpain, and the “Gergo” of Italy. All these, like the English “slang,”\r\nconsist chiefly of words borrowed from the languages of the several\r\ncountries in which they prevail, applied in a hidden sense known only\r\nto the initiated. On the contrary the gipsy idiom is almost a language\r\nproperly so called. See a singular chapter in Borrow’s Gipsies in Spain,\r\n242-57. For a copious vocabulary of the “Argot” of the French thieves,\r\nsee M.

See an interesting biography in the Memorie di Modena.\r\n\r\n[406] Manavit, p. 51.\r\n\r\n[407] I may preserve here an impromptu Greek distich of Mezzofanti’s,\r\naddressed to Cavedoni on the publication of his “Memoir on the\r\nantiquities of the Museum of Modena,” which, although commonplace enough\r\nin sentiment, at least illustrates his curious facility of versification.\r\n\r\n                  “Εις Kαιλεστινον Kαυεδόνιον.\r\n    Μνήματα τῶν πάλαι ἄνθρwπων σοφὸς ὅσσ’ ἀναφαίνεις,\r\n    Ἔκ χρόνος ὂυ πέρθει· σὄν δὲ κλέος θαλέθει.”\r\n\r\nIt was an impromptu in the literal sense of the word, being thrown off\r\nwithout a moment’s thought, and in the midst of a group of friends. His\r\nfriend Ferrucci rendered it into the following Latin distich.\r\n\r\n                  Celestino Cavedonio.\r\n    Omnia que prudens aperis monumenta priorum\r\n    Ævo intacta manent: hinc tibi fama viget.\r\n\r\n[408] “L’Eneide di Virgilio, recata in versi Italiani, da Annibale\r\nCaro,” 2 vols. folio. It was printed by De Romanis. The duchess was\r\nthe Lady Elizabeth Hervey, daughter of the episcopal Earl of Bristol;\r\nand after the death of her first husband, Mr. Forster, had married\r\nthe Duke of Devonshire. She is the true heroine of Gibbon’s ludicrous\r\nlove-scene at Lausanne, described by Lord Brougham, but by him related\r\nof Mademoiselle Susan Curchod, afterwards Madame Necker.

For the details, however, I am indebted\r\nto an interesting communication from the abate Mazza, Vice-Rector of the\r\nPontifical Seminary at Bologna.\r\n\r\n[416] The author of this version, Ercole Faello, is not mentioned by\r\nTiraboschi, nor can I find any other notice of him. His version has no\r\nvalue, except perhaps as a bibliographical curiosity; and Mezzofanti’s\r\ncriticism of it in his letter to Cavedoni, is the most judicious that\r\ncould be offered—the simple recital of a few sentences as a specimen of\r\nits obscure and involved style. The Tetrasticha, especially, deserves\r\na better rendering. It consists of fifty-nine iambic tetrastichs, many\r\nof which, besides the solid instruction which they embody, are full of\r\nsimple beauty. The Monosticha is chiefly notable as an ancient example\r\nof an acrostic poem on a spiritual subject. It consists of twenty-four\r\niambic verses, commencing in succession with the successive letters of\r\nthe alphabet, thus:—\r\n\r\n    Ἀρχήν ἁπάντω· καὶ τὲλος ποιὂυ Θεόν·\r\n    Βίου τὸ κέρδος ὲκβιοῦ καθ’ ἡμέραν. κ.τ.λ.\r\n\r\nFaello’s version appears not to have been known to the Benedictine\r\neditors.\r\n\r\n[417] See _Catalogo della Libreria_, p. 65.\r\n\r\n[418] For an account of these books see Father Vincenzo Sangermano’s\r\n_Relazione del Regno Barmano_, Rome, 1833. Sangermano was a Barnabite\r\nFather, and had been for many years a missionary in Ava and Pegu. He\r\nstates that he himself translated these sacred books. (p. 359.) His\r\northography of the names is slightly different from Mezzofanti’s.\r\n\r\n[419] Idler in Italy, III. p. 321.\r\n\r\n[420] Padre Scandellari died in December, 1831. He is spoken of in terms\r\nof high praise in the Gazzetta di Bologna for Dec. 27.\r\n\r\n[421] Madame de Chaussegros was the widow of the officer by whom Toulon\r\nwas surrendered to the English, in 1793.\r\n\r\n[422] In the hope of arriving at a still more accurate estimate of\r\nMezzofanti’s performance in German conversation, I wrote to request of\r\nDr. Tholuck a note of the “four minor mistakes” to which he alluded.\r\nUnfortunately the memorandum which he had made at the time, although he\r\nrecollects to have observed it quite recently in his papers, has been\r\nmislaid, as has also been the Persian distich which Mezzofanti composed\r\nduring the interview.\r\n\r\n[423] At the time of the Restoration, Cornish was still a living\r\nlanguage, especially in the West; but, a century later it had quite\r\ndisappeared, its sole living representative being an old fish-woman,\r\nDolly Pentrath, who was still able to curse and scold in her expressive\r\nvernacular. See Adelung, II. 152.\r\n\r\n[424] It was in great part from these papers that Cav. Minarelli compiled\r\nthe list of the several languages cultivated at various times by Cardinal\r\nMezzofanti, to which I shall have occasion to refer soon after.\r\n\r\n[425] There is another circumstance of Dr. Tholuck’s narrative which it\r\nis not easy to reconcile with the account already cited (p. 239,) from\r\nM. Molbech’s Travels;—namely, that “when addressed in Danish he replied\r\nin Swedish,” since the former was the only language in which, during an\r\ninterview of about two hours, Mezzofanti conversed with M. Molbech. In\r\norder to remove all uncertainty as to this point, I have had inquiry of\r\nM. Molbech in person, through the kind offices of the Rev. Dr. Grüder,\r\na learned German Missionary resident at Copenhagen, who himself knew\r\nCardinal Mezzofanti, and whose testimony to the purity and fluency of\r\nhis Eminence’s German conversation I may add to the many already known.\r\nM. Molbech reiterates and confirms all the statements made by him in\r\nhis ‘Travels.’ He has even taken the trouble to forward a note in his\r\nown hand-writing, referring to the page in the Transactions of the\r\nPhilological Society, which contains M. Watts’s translation from his\r\nbook. He adds, that when in 1847, his son waited upon the Cardinal in\r\nRome, for the purpose of presenting him some of M. Molbech’s works, he\r\nfound his Eminence’s recollection of the interview perfectly fresh and\r\naccurate as to all its details.\r\n\r\n[426] The reader will scarcely agree with this observation of Dr.\r\nTholuck. The Quichua was one of the languages which, as the Dr.\r\ntestifies, Mezzofanti only professed to know _imperfectly_. It must be\r\nremembered too, that, during his early years he had many and prolonged\r\nopportunities of intercourse with Father Escobar and other South American\r\nJesuit missionaries, who had settled at Bologna, and from whom he may\r\nhave acquired the language, much more solidly than he could be supposed\r\nto learn it from a few casual interviews such as Dr. Tholuck most\r\nprobably contemplated.\r\n\r\n[427] The Gulistan is found in the Cardinal’s catalogue, p. 109.\r\n\r\n[428] p. 26. Oddly enough they are classed among the _Bohemian_ books.\r\n\r\n[429] _Friesche Rymlerije._ It is mentioned by Adelung, II. p. 237.\r\n\r\n[430] Vol. xvi., p. 229-30.\r\n\r\n[431] See a very curious chapter in Tiraboschi, vol. vii., p. 139-201;\r\nwhich Disraeli has, as usual, turned freely to his own account in the\r\nCuriosities of Literature, p. 348-54.\r\n\r\n[432] This is the origin of the nom-de-guerre, La Lasca—(_the Roach_,) by\r\nwhich the too notorious novelist, Grazzini, chose to designate himself as\r\nmember of this society.\r\n\r\n[433] All’ Em̅o Signor Cardinal Giuseppe Mezzofanti, Applausi dei\r\nFilopieri, 8vo.

The analogies of all these treatises with\r\nthe works of the Western writers on the same sciences, are exceedingly\r\ncurious and interesting.\r\n\r\n[435] Some curious and interesting remarks on the peculiarity of the\r\nIndian languages here mentioned by M. Libri, will be found in Du\r\nPonceau’s “Memoire sur le Systeme Grammaticale des Langues Indiennes,”\r\npp. 143, and foll. Some words in the Chippewa language contain _thirteen_\r\nor _fourteen_ syllables; but they should be called phrases rather\r\nthan words. M. Du Ponceau gives an example from the language of the\r\nIndians of Massachusetts—the word _wutappesittukquissunnuhwehtunkquoh_,\r\n“_genuflecting_!” p. 143. The same characteristic is found in the\r\nMexican and Central American languages. In Mexican “a parish-priest” is\r\n“_notlazomanitzteopitzkatatzins_!”\r\n\r\n[436] While M. Libri was writing this letter, he learned that Count\r\nPepoli was in possession of a short autobiographical sketch of\r\nMezzofanti. The count subsequently was good enough to permit me to\r\ninspect this fragment; but I was mortified to find that it was not by the\r\nCardinal himself, but by some member of his family. It is very short, and\r\ncontains no fact which I had not previously known.\r\n\r\n[437] See the series of the _Gazzetta di Bologna_; see also Spalding’s\r\n“Italy and the Italian Islands,” for a compendious but accurate summary\r\nof the facts.\r\n\r\n[438] See the official announcements in the _Diario di Roma_ in March and\r\nApril.\r\n\r\n[439] _Diario di Roma_, May 9, 1831.\r\n\r\n[440] Mijne Reis naar Rome in het voorjaar van 1837.

II. 723.\r\n\r\n[444] According to my informant at Naples, the affection under which\r\nMezzofanti laboured is described by the local phrase “_rompergli le\r\nchiancarelle_,”—a Neapolitan idiom which expresses something like our own\r\nphrase that “his brains were addled.” It was ascribed to the excessive\r\ndifficulty of the Chinese, and to his own immoderate application. My\r\ninformant also states that, at his worst moments, his mind was recalled\r\nat once from its wandering by the mere mention of the name of the Holy\r\nFather, to whom he was most tenderly attached.\r\n\r\n[445] Fleck’s Wissenschaftliche Reise, I. p. 94.\r\n\r\n[446] After the Revolution of 1848-9 the Chinese students for a time\r\nceased to be sent to the Propaganda. Their entire course was completed in\r\nthe Neapolitan College. They have again resumed their attendance.\r\n\r\n[447] Letters and Journals, III. 313, 315, 334.\r\n\r\n[448] On the extraordinary Powers of Card.

II.\r\n203) relates this anecdote differently. She has confounded together two\r\ndifferent periods at which Dr. Baines met Mezzofanti—the first at Bologna\r\nwhen this incident occurred, the second many years later, when Mezzofanti\r\nwas Librarian of the Vatican. The anecdote, as related above, was\r\ncommunicated to me by the late Rev. Dr. Cox, of Southampton, who learned\r\nit from the bishop himself.\r\n\r\n[451] The relation of the English language to the ancient British tongue\r\nis discussed by Latham, “The English Language,” vol.

In him, let him honour that\r\nman who is fit to be the earth’s interpreter—whose intellect penetrates\r\nthe language-secret of all nations.\r\n\r\n“Accept, son of the South, the respectful salutation of the North. But\r\nthink, while your eye beholds my poor address, that if the Batavians’\r\nlanguage lacks Italian melody, their tongue and soul are both averse to\r\nflattery.”\r\n\r\nMezzofanti’s reply:—\r\n\r\n“Sir, when first the day my eyes were cast upon your beautiful address,\r\nI was quite enraptured by your great kindness. It so raised up my mind\r\nand heart, that, although master of fifty languages, my tongue remained\r\nspeechless—But lest I should seem an ingrate, I beg you just to read my\r\nheart.”\r\n\r\n[461] This is not quite correctly cited—The passage is in the sixth of\r\nthe Elegies, “aus Rom,” [vol. I. p. 48. Paris, 1836.]\r\n\r\n        ————So hab’ ich von Herzen,\r\n    Rothstrumpf immer gehasst und violet-strumpf dazu.\r\n\r\nIt certainly deserves all the ridicule which Mezzofanti heaps on it, and\r\nmight well make\r\n\r\n        ————the Muses, on their racks,\r\n    Scream like the winding of ten thousand jacks.\r\n\r\nThe allusion to ‘red stocking’ and ‘violet stocking,’ is one of Goethe’s\r\nhabitual sneers at the Catholic prelacy.\r\n\r\n[462] The idea which Mezzofanti throws out here as to the seeming\r\nnational unconsciousness of the metrical capabilities of the Magyar\r\nlanguage is very curiously developed by Mr. Watts, in a paper recently\r\nread before the Philological Society.

He is favourably known to Greek scholars besides\r\nby his _Anecdota Græca_, 2 vols. 8vo., Rome, 1850, consisting of the\r\n_Allegoriæ Homericæ_ of Tzetzes, and many other remains of ancient\r\nscholiast commentators upon Homer, and of some unpublished Anacreontic\r\npoems of the Byzantine period.\r\n\r\n[478] Moore (Diary, III. p. 183,) mentions him as “the Abate Meli, a\r\nSicilian poet, of whom he had never heard before.” He is, nevertheless,\r\na voluminous writer of pastorals, sonnets, ballads, and odes, sacred and\r\nprofane. His largest poem, however, is an epic of twelve cantos on the\r\nHistory of Don Quixote, in _ottava rima_. After a little trouble it may\r\nbe read without much difficulty by any one acquainted with the ordinary\r\nItalian, and is highly amusing. Meli’s works are collected into one vol.\r\nroyal 8vo., Palermo, 1846.\r\n\r\n[479] See account in _Civiltà Cattolica_ (by F.

A young Mulatto of the Dutch West Indian Island of Curaçoa,\r\nnamed Enrico Gomez, arrived about a fortnight before Epiphany, 1845.\r\nHe spoke no language except the “Nigger Dutch,” of his native island.\r\nMezzofanti took him into his hands, and before the day of Academy\r\n(the Sunday after Epiphany) he had not only established a mode of\r\ncommunication with him, but had learned his language, and even composed\r\nfor him a short poetical piece, which Gomez recited at the Academy!\r\nA third case, of three Albanian youths, is mentioned in the Civiltà\r\nCattolica, VII. p. 571.\r\n\r\n[483] These youths are mentioned in “Shea’s Catholic Missions among the\r\nIndian Tribes” (p. 387,) a work of exceeding interest and most carefully\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\n[484] Sketches in Canada, pp. 214-15.\r\n\r\n[485] See his Memoire sur le Systeme Grammaticale, p. 97, also p. 306,\r\nand in the appendix _passim_.\r\n\r\n[486] See Du Ponceau, Memoire, p. 294-5.\r\n\r\n[487] Not only are the inflexions entirely different from those of the\r\nlanguages to which we are accustomed, but the very use of inflexions is\r\naltogether peculiar. For example, in the Chippewa language there is an\r\ninflexion of nouns, similar to our conjugation of verbs, by which all the\r\nstates of the noun are expressed. Thus the word _man_ can be inflected\r\nfor person, to signify, ‘_I am_ a man,’ ‘_thou art_ a man,’ ‘_he is_ a\r\nman;’ &c. So also the inflexions of the verb transitive vary according to\r\nthe gender of the object—See Mrs. Jameson, p. 196. Schoolcraft ascribes\r\nthe same character to the entire Algonquin family—See Du Ponceau, pp.\r\n130-5.\r\n\r\n[488] Letter of M. d’Abbadie, dated May 4, 1855.\r\n\r\n[489] Letter of May 23rd, 1855.\r\n\r\n[490] The Signor Churi mentioned by M. Fernando is the author of a\r\ncurious and interesting volume of travels—“The Sea Nile, the Desert\r\nand Nigritia,” published in 1853. Being obliged by ill health to leave\r\nthe Propaganda, and unwilling for many reasons to return to his native\r\nLebanon, he settled in London as a teacher of oriental languages. One\r\nof his pupils in Arabic, Captain Peel, engaged him in 1850, as his\r\ninterpreter in a tour of Egypt, Syria, and the Holy Land, and afterwards,\r\nin 1851, in an expedition to the interior of Africa, which forms the\r\nsubject of Signor Churi’s volume.\r\n\r\n[491] I have been assured by M. Bauer, a student of the Propaganda in\r\n1855, that he often conversed with the Cardinal in Hungarian, during the\r\nyears 1847 and 1848.\r\n\r\n[492] A comparative Grammar of the Dravidian, or South-Indian Family of\r\nLanguages.

Besides this,\r\nthere are dialects peculiar to the provinces of Kouang-tong, and Fo-kien,\r\nas well as several minor dialects.

I had submitted these pieces to Dr.\r\nLivingston; but as he, having been ill all the time he remained in\r\nAngola, had never learned that language, he was good enough to send the\r\npapers to Mr. Brande. The latter, besides kindly communicating to me his\r\nown opinion regarding them, has taken the trouble to forward them to\r\na friend at Loando, to be submitted to an intelligent native in whose\r\njudgment Mr. Brande has full confidence; but as yet (March 15, 1858,) no\r\nreply has reached me.\r\n\r\n[500] See an excellent article in Morone’s “Dizionario di Erudizione\r\nStorico-ecclesiastica,” as also the Kirchen-Lexicon, vol. II. 344 and\r\nfoll.\r\n\r\n[501] A friend of mine who chanced to pass as one of these carriages\r\n(which had been dismantled preparatory to its being newly fitted up,)\r\nwas on its way to the Pontifical Factory for the purpose, overheard some\r\nidle boys who were looking on, laughing at its heavy, lumbering look, and\r\nsaying to each other: “_Che barcaccia!_” (What a shocking old boat!). He\r\nwas greatly amused at the indignation with which the coachman resented\r\nthis impertinent criticism.\r\n\r\n[502] A sample of Mezzofanti’s own performance as a Filopiero—his reply\r\nto the verses of his friend, Count Marchesi—is given by Marchetti, in his\r\n_Pagine Monumentali_, p. 150.\r\n\r\n    De tuoi versi il contento,\r\n    Cosi nell’ alma io sento,\r\n    Che versi rendo gratulando teco,\r\n    Ma oime’! ch’ io son qual eco,\r\n    Che molti suoni asconde,\r\n    E languida da lungi al fin responde.\r\n\r\n[503] The title is “All’ Ementissimo Signor Cardinale Giuseppe\r\nMezzofanti, Bolognese, elevato all’ Onore della Porpora Romana, Applausi\r\ndei Filopieri, 8vo., Bologna, 1838.” A similar tribute from the pen of\r\nDoctor Veggetti, who had succeeded Mezzofanti as Librarian, appeared\r\na short time before, entitled “Tributo di Lode a Giuseppe Mezzofanti,\r\nBolognese, creato Cardinale il Giorno 12 Febbraro, 1838.” Bologna, 1838.\r\n\r\n[504] Stolz, Biografia, p. 7.\r\n\r\n[505] A bon-mot on occasion of Monsignor Mezzofanti’s elevation, which\r\nI heard from Cardinal Wiseman, and which is ascribed to the good old\r\nCardinal Rivarola, is worth recording, although the point is not fully\r\nappreciable, except in Italian.\r\n\r\nMezzofanti, from his childhood, had worn ear-rings, as a preventive,\r\naccording to the popular notion, against an affection of the eyes, to\r\nwhich he had been subject. Some one observed that it was strange to see a\r\n“Cardinal wearing ear-rings,” (_chi porta orecchini_.)\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” rejoined Cardinal Rivarola, “Ci han da essere tanti uomini\r\nin dignità che portano _orecchine_ (”long ears“—”asses ears,“) e perchè\r\nnon ci ha da essere uno almeno chi porti _orecchini_? (ear-rings.) There\r\nare many dignitaries who have _orecchine_, (asses-ears), and why should\r\nnot there be at least one with _orecchini_—ear-rings?”\r\n\r\n[506] Perhaps it is not generally known that the brothers Antoine and\r\nArnauld d’Abbadie, although French by name, fortune, and education, are\r\nnot only children of an Irish mother, but were born, and spent the first\r\nyears of childhood, in Dublin. M. Antoine d’Abbadie lived in Dublin till\r\nhis eighth year. See his letter to the Athenæum, (Cairo, Nov. 15, 1848,)\r\nvol. for 1849, p. 93.\r\n\r\n[507] The _Journal Asiatique_, passim; the Athenæum, 1839, 1845, 1849:\r\nthe Geographical Society of France, and of England, &c.\r\n\r\n[508] M. d’Abbadie collected with great care, as opportunity offered,\r\nvocabularies, more or less extensive, of a vast number of the languages\r\nof this region of Africa. His collections, also, on the natural history\r\nand geography, as well as on the religious and social condition of\r\nthe country, are most extensive and valuable. The work in which he is\r\nunderstood to be engaged upon the subject, is looked for with much\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n[509] When M. d’Abbadie, in one of his letters to the Athenæum, first\r\nalluded to the Ilmorma, its existence, as a distinct language, was\r\nabsolutely denied.\r\n\r\n[510] One of the writers on the Basque Grammar, Manuel de Larramendi,\r\nentitles his book, Impossible vencido, (“The Impossible Overcome,”) 8vo.\r\nSalamanca, 1729. Some idea, though a faint one, of the difficulty of this\r\nGrammar, may be formed from the number and names of the words of a Basque\r\nverb. They are no less than eleven; and are denominated by grammarians,\r\nthe Indicative, the Consuetudinal, the Potential, the Voluntary,\r\nthe Necessary (coactive,) the Imperative, Subjunctive, Optative,\r\n_Penitudinary_ (!) and Infinitive.—The variety of tenses in Basque also,\r\nis very great. But it should be added that the structure of these moods\r\nand tenses is described as singularly philosophical, and full of harmony\r\nand of analogy.\r\n\r\n[511] Letter of M. d’Abbadie, May 6, 1855.\r\n\r\n[512] Manavit, p. 109.\r\n\r\n[513] Olaszhoni es Schweizi Vtazas Irta Paget Janosné Wesselenyi\r\nPolyxena, 1842, vol.

It contains the original and\r\nthe translation in parallel pages. The author was Sieur Townley the\r\nwell-known collector, and a member of the distinguished catholic family\r\nof that name. The translation is certainly most curiously exact in letter\r\nand in spirit, and fully deserves all that Mr. Badeley has said of it.\r\n\r\n[523] The exhibition at present, and for some years back, is held in the\r\nchurch of the Propaganda.\r\n\r\n[524] Of the princely house of Massimo, which is said to claim descent\r\nfrom the great _Cunctator_. The marked contrast between the diminutive\r\nstature of the Cardinal, and the noble and commanding figure of the\r\nPrince, his elder brother, gave occasion to one of those lively _mots_\r\nfor which Rome is celebrated. The brothers were called, “Il Principe\r\n_Massimo_, ed il Cardinal _Menomo_.”\r\n\r\n[525] These were (1,) Hebrew; (2,) Syriac; (3,) Samaritan; (4,) ancient\r\nChaldee; (5,) Modern Chaldee; (6,) Arabic; (7,) ancient Armenian; (8,)\r\nmodern Armenian; (9,) Turkish; (10,) Persian; (11,) Albanian; (12,)\r\nSabean;—a dialect of Syriac, which Adelung prefers to call Zabian;—(13,)\r\nMaltese; (14,) Greek; (15,) Romaic; (16,) Ethiopic; (17,) Coptic; (18,)\r\nAmariña; (19,) Tamul; (20,) Koordish; (21,) Kunkan,—one of the dialects\r\nof the Bengal coast;—(22,) Georgian; (23,) Welsh; (24,) Irish; (25,)\r\nGælic; (26,) English; (27,) Illyrian; (28,) Bulgarian; (29,) Polish;\r\n(30,) Peguan; (31,) Swedish; (32,) ancient German; (33,) modern German;\r\n(34,) Swiss German; (35,) Dutch; (36,) Spanish; (37,) Catalan; (38,)\r\nPortuguese; (39,) French; (40,) ancient Chinese; (41,) Chinese of\r\nTchang-si; (42,) Chinese of Canton.\r\n\r\nI was somewhat surprised to miss Russian from the catalogue. In the\r\nAcademy of the present year, it appears in its proper place. See\r\n“Academia Poliglotta nel Collegio Urbano de Prop. Fide, per l’Epifania\r\ndel 1858,” p. 38.\r\n\r\n[526] This youth, as I afterwards learned, was called by the strange\r\nname, Moses Ngnau. He was a native of Pegu, and returned to his own\r\nmission in 1850; but unhappily his career was terminated by an early\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n[527] The journals of this week, (March 18,) relate a most astonishing\r\nfeat of the great modern chess-player, Dr. Harwitz. He has just played\r\nthree games simultaneously, against three most eminent players, without\r\nonce seeing any of the boards, or even entering the room in which the\r\nmoves were made, during the entire time! He won two of the games—the\r\nthird being a drawn one.\r\n\r\n[528] The most recent information regarding this curious subject is\r\ncontained in a report by Dr. Aufrecht, which Bunsen has printed in his\r\nChristianity and Mankind, III., p. 87, and foll; See also Mommsen’s\r\nUnter-italische Dialekten.\r\n\r\n[529] Letter of January 15, 1857.\r\n\r\n[530] Cardinal Wiseman told me of a priest who, after having lived for\r\ntwenty years in France, was mortified to find himself discovered as\r\nan Englishman, by the way in which he said “ah!” in expression of his\r\nacknowledgment of an answer given to him by a person to whom he addressed\r\na question in a crowd. This may explain an anecdote in Moore’s Diary,\r\nwhich he could not himself understand. A lady was coming in to dinner,\r\nand, on her passing through the ante-room, where Talleyrand was standing,\r\nhe looked up and exclaimed insignificantly “ah!” In the course of the\r\ndinner, the lady, having asked him across the table why he had uttered\r\nthe exclamation of “oh”! on her entrance, Talleyrand, with a grave\r\nself-vindicatory look, answered; _Madame, je n’ai pas dit_ oh! _j’ai dit_\r\nah, (_Memoirs VII., p. 5_).\r\n\r\nOne of the standing jokes against the capuchins in Italy is about an\r\n“alphabet” which they are supposed to learn during the noviciate, and\r\nwhich consists exclusively of the interjection _O!_—which single sound,\r\nby the varieties of look, gesture, air, and expression which accompany\r\nit, is made to embody almost every conceivable meaning.\r\n\r\nMuch light is thrown on more than one obscure passage in the Latin\r\nclassics by the gesticulations which still prevail in modern Italy,\r\nespecially in Naples. See the Canon De Jorio’s extremely curious and\r\nlearned book, “Mimica degli Antichi investigata nel Gestire Napolitano.”\r\n\r\n[531] Supra, p. 379.\r\n\r\n[532] The pun is less observable in writing than in speaking; the words\r\n_weiss-haar_ and _weiser_ resemble each other more closely in sound, than\r\nin appearance. It might be rendered:\r\n\r\n“Would to God, that, as I have become _whiter_, so I had also grown\r\n_wiser_!”\r\n\r\n[533] This is a mistake. The work published at Philadelphia is not\r\na general treatise on the Indian Languages, but a Grammar of the\r\nLenni-Lennape Language nor is it an original work of Du Ponceau: but a\r\ntranslation by him, with notes, from the German MS. of David Zeisberger.\r\nIt is in 4to. and was published at Philadelphia in 1827.

I., p. 144.\r\n\r\n[539] See the _Allgemeine Zeitung_, for 1846. No. 4, p. 27. See also the\r\nKirchen-Lexicon. B. IV., p. 729. This interview forms the subject of one\r\nof the most brilliant sketches in Cardinal Wiseman’s “Recollections of\r\nthe Last Four Popes,” pp. 409, and foll.\r\n\r\n[540] Manavit, p. 113.\r\n\r\n[541] Translated by Mr. Watts.\r\n\r\n    “The fire that burns within that breast of thine,\r\n    Mother of God! O kindle it in mine.”\r\n\r\n                          _Trans. of Philological Society, 1854, p. 148._\r\n\r\n[542] See an article in “Household Words,” May 13, 1854 (No. 216). See\r\nalso Rohrbacher’s Histoire de l’Eglise, T. XXVIII. pp. 431-42.\r\n\r\n[543] Manavit, p. 95.\r\n\r\n[544] Quoted by Manavit, p. 98.\r\n\r\n[545] Another impromptu epigram composed by the Cardinal, while the\r\nmemorable procession of the 8th of September following, was returning\r\nfrom the Church of Santa Maria del Popolo, amid the universal jubilation\r\nof Rome, and of representatives of all the Papal provinces, has been\r\ncommunicated to me.\r\n\r\n    Te Patre, Teque Pio, junguntur Principe corda:—\r\n    Ecce Tibi unum cor, Felsina, Roma, sumus!\r\n\r\n[546] Civiltà Cattolica VII, p. 877. This brilliant account of the\r\nCardinal is given in the “Appendix” of Father Bresciani’s _Ebreo di\r\nVerona_, and is full of most curious and interesting details.\r\n\r\n[547] Civiltà Cattolica, VII. p. 577.\r\n\r\n[548] His _zucchetto_, the red skull-cap worn by Cardinals, is preserved\r\nin the collection at Abbotsford.\r\n\r\n[549] Civiltà Cattolica, VII. 596.\r\n\r\n[550] _Civiltà Cattolica_, VII., p. 578.\r\n\r\n[551] I do not know what language is here meant. Perhaps it is a mistake\r\nfor _Bavara_—the Bavarian dialect of German: or possibly it may mean the\r\nDutch of the _Boors_ at the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\n[552] Possibly _Berberica_—the Barbary dialect of Arabic.\r\n\r\n[553] This is probably meant for _Concanico_—an Indian language which\r\noften appeared in the programme of the Propaganda Academy, while\r\nMezzofanti was in Rome. It is the dialect of Kunka, in the province of\r\nOrissa.\r\n\r\n[554] This is certainly meant for _Tepehuana_, one of the Central\r\nAmerican point of languages.\r\n\r\n[555] Probably by these names are meant the two _spoken_ dialects of\r\nthe orthodox Christians of modern Egypt. The Coptic (No. 23.) is the\r\n_learned_ language of the Liturgy.\r\n\r\n[556] This item, as well as Nos. 47 and 53, may be ascribed to the\r\nwriter’s desire to swell the total of his uncle’s languages—I need hardly\r\nsay that they have no practical bearing on the question.\r\n\r\n[557] I am unable to conjecture the meaning of this name.\r\n\r\n[558] This is either a repetition of No. 56., or it designates the whole\r\nclass of languages called Iberian, and not an individual language.\r\n\r\n[559] Perhaps Misteco—the Mistek; one of the Mexican group of languages.\r\nMany interesting particulars regarding them will be found in Squier’s\r\nNicaragua.\r\n\r\n[560] This probably means the old Celtic of Brittany. No. 50 is the\r\nmodern patois of the province.\r\n\r\n[561] If this be meant for Gælic, as seems likely, No. 73 can only be the\r\nLowland Scotch.\r\n\r\n[562] I need hardly observe on the vagueness of this name. Mezzofanti\r\nlearned from more than one missionary something of the languages of\r\nOceanica; but how much I have no means of determining.\r\n\r\n[563] For Pampanga, one of the languages of the Philippine Islands—an\r\noffshoot of the Malay family.\r\n\r\n[564] The old language of Peru. It is fast recovering the ground from\r\nwhich it had been driven by the Spanish. See Markham’s “Cuzco and Lima.”\r\n\r\n[565] I cannot guess what is meant by this name.\r\n\r\n[566] A language of the New Hebrides. See Adelung, I. p. 626.\r\n\r\n[567] There can be no doubt that much light on this point may be derived\r\nfrom a thorough examination of these books and manuscripts; and I trust\r\nthat some of the Cardinal’s friends at Rome, (where his library is now\r\ndeposited, having been purchased for the Vatican,) will undertake the\r\ntask. I have endeavoured in some degree to supply the want by a careful\r\nexamination of the catalogue published in Rome in 1851, and often cited\r\nin this volume. But it is so full of the grossest and most ludicrous\r\ninaccuracies, so utterly unscientific, and so constantly confounds one\r\nlanguage with another, that it can only be used with the utmost caution,\r\nand at best affords but little assistance for the purposes of the Memoir.\r\n\r\n[568] I should observe that I do not think it necessary to adopt the\r\nnomenclature of languages recently introduced. I will for the most part\r\nfollow that of Adelung.\r\n\r\n[569] I shall refer for the several languages, to the pages which contain\r\nthe notices of the Cardinal’s proficiency in each. There are two or three\r\ncases in which the proof may not appear quite decisive: but I have much\r\nunderstated, even in these, the common opinion of his friends.\r\n\r\n[570] In this and the few other instances in which I have referred to\r\nCavaliere Minarelli’s list of the Cardinal’s languages, it is amply\r\nsupported by the printed catalogue of his library, which contains several\r\nworks in each language, evidently provided with a view to the study of it.\r\n\r\n[571] I once travelled through the entire length of France with a friend,\r\nwho was an excellent book-scholar in the French language, but who, from\r\nthe feeling which I describe, never could prevail on himself to attempt\r\nto speak French in my presence. During a journey of several days, I only\r\nheard him utter one solitary _oui_; and even this was at a time when he\r\nwas not aware that I was within hearing.\r\n\r\n[572] p. 290.\r\n\r\n[573] p. 78.\r\n\r\n[574] P. 391.\r\n\r\n[575] P. 291\r\n\r\n[576] There is little originality in this piece, the words and forms\r\nbeing closely scriptural. It is without points, but he occasionally,\r\nalso, employed them in writing Hebrew.\r\n\r\n[577] Eumetes was the name under which, by ancient usage of the _Arcadi_,\r\nGregory XVI., before his elevation, had been enrolled in their Academy.\r\n\r\n[578] Domenichino’s Communion of St. Jerome.\r\n\r\n[579] Communion of St. Sebastian, also by Domenichino.\r\n\r\n[580] Guercino’s St. Petronilla.\r\n\r\n[581] Algardi’s bas-relief group of Attila and St. Leo.\r\n\r\n[582] As I have no knowledge of this or the Grisons language, I fear the\r\northography will be found inaccurate.",
