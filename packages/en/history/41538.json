BYRN, A.M.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Δός που στω, και την γην κινἡσω.”\r\n  (Give me where to stand, and I’ll move the earth.)\r\n  --_Archimedes._\r\n\r\n\r\n  MUNN & CO., PUBLISHERS\r\n\r\n  SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN OFFICE\r\n  361 BROADWAY, NEW YORK\r\n\r\n  1900\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  COPYRIGHTED, 1900, BY MUNN & CO.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ENTERED AT STATIONER’S HALL\r\n  LONDON, ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED\r\n\r\n\r\n  Printed in the United States of America by\r\n  The Manufacturers’ and Publishers’ Printing Company,\r\n  New York City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a work of such scope as this, the first word of the author should be\r\nan apology for what is doubtless the too ambitious effort of a single\r\nwriter. A quarter of a century in the high tide of the arts and\r\nsciences, an ardent interest in all things that make for scientific\r\nprogress, and the aid and encouragement of many friends in and about the\r\nPatent Office, furnish the explanation. The work cannot claim the\r\nauthority of a text-book, the fullness of a history, nor the exactness\r\nof a technical treatise. It is simply a cursory view of the century in\r\nthe field of invention, intended to present the broader bird’s-eye view\r\nof progress achieved. In substantiation of the main facts reliance has\r\nbeen placed chiefly upon patents, which for historic development are\r\nbelieved to be the best of all authorities, because they carry the\r\nresponsibility of the National Government as to dates, and the attested\r\nsignature and oath of the inventor as to subject matter. Many\r\ndifficulties and embarrassments have been encountered in the work. The\r\nfear of extending it into a too bulky volume has excluded treatment of\r\nmany subjects which the author recognizes as important, and issues in\r\ndispute as to the claims of inventors have also presented themselves in\r\nperplexing conflict. A discussion of the latter has been avoided as far\r\nas possible, the paramount object being to do justice to all the worthy\r\nworkers in this field, with favor to none, and only expressing such\r\nconclusions as seem to be justified by authenticated facts and the\r\nimpartial verdict of reason in the clearing atmosphere of time. For sins\r\nof omission a lack of space affords a reasonable excuse, and for those\r\nof commission the great scope of the work is pleaded in extenuation. It\r\nis hoped, however, that the volume may find an accepted place in the\r\nliterature of the day, as presenting in compact form some comprehensive\r\nand coherent idea of the great things in invention which the Nineteenth\r\nCentury has added to the world’s wealth of ideas and material resources.\r\n\r\nIn acknowledging the many obligations to friends who have aided me in\r\nthe work, my thanks are due first to the Editors of the _Scientific\r\nAmerican_ for aid rendered in the preparation of the work; also to\r\ncourteous officials in the Government Departments, and to many\r\nprogressive manufacturers throughout the country.\r\n\r\n  E.

It has been\r\nsomething more than a merely normal growth or natural development. It\r\nhas been a gigantic tidal wave of human ingenuity and resource, so\r\nstupendous in its magnitude, so complex in its diversity, so profound in\r\nits thought, so fruitful in its wealth, so beneficent in its results,\r\nthat the mind is strained and embarrassed in its effort to expand to a\r\nfull appreciation of it. Indeed, the period seems a grand climax of\r\ndiscovery, rather than an increment of growth. It has been a splendid,\r\nbrilliant campaign of brains and energy, rising to the highest\r\nachievement amid the most fertile resources, and conducted by the\r\nstrongest and best equipment of modern thought and modern strength.\r\n\r\nThe great works of the ancients are in the main mere monuments of the\r\npatient manual labor of myriads of workers, and can only rank with the\r\nbuildings of the diatom and coral insect. Not so with modern\r\nachievement. The last century has been peculiarly an age of ideas and\r\nconservation of energy, materialized in practical embodiment as\r\nlabor-saving inventions, often the product of a single mind, and\r\npartaking of the sacred quality of creation.\r\n\r\nThe old word of creation is, that God breathed into the clay the breath\r\nof life. In the new world of invention mind has breathed into matter,\r\nand a new and expanding creation unfolds itself. The speculative\r\nphilosophy of the past is but a too empty consolation for short-lived,\r\nbusy man, and, seeing with the eye of science the possibilities of\r\nmatter, he has touched it with the divine breath of thought and made a\r\nnew world.\r\n\r\nWhen the Nineteenth Century registered its advent in history, the world\r\nof invention was a babe still in its swaddling clothes, but, with a\r\nconsciousness of coming power, was beginning to stretch its strong\r\nyoung arms into the tremendous energy of its life. James Watt had\r\ninvented the steam engine. Eli Whitney had given us the cotton gin. John\r\nGutenberg had made his printing type. Franklin had set up his press. The\r\ntelescope had suggested the possibilities of ethereal space, the compass\r\nwas already the mariner’s best friend, and gunpowder had given proof of\r\nits deadly agency, but inventive genius was still groping by the light\r\nof a tallow candle. Even up to the beginning of this century so strong a\r\nhold had superstition on the human mind, that inventions were almost\r\nsynonymous with the black arts, and the struggling genius had not only\r\nto contend with the natural laws and the thousand and one expected\r\ndifficulties that hedge the path of the inventor, but had also to\r\novercome the far greater obstacles of ignorant fear and bigoted\r\nprejudice. A labor-saving machine was looked upon askance as the enemy\r\nof the working man, and many an earnest inventor, after years of arduous\r\nthought and painstaking labor, saw his cherished model broken up and his\r\nhopes forever blasted by the animosity of his fellow men. But with the\r\nNineteenth Century a new era has dawned. The legitimate results of\r\ninventions have been realized in larger incomes, shorter hours of labor,\r\nand lives so much richer in health, comfort, happiness, and usefulness,\r\nthat to-day the inventor is a benefactor whom the world delights to\r\nhonor. So crowded is the busy life of modern civilization with the\r\nevidences of his work, that it is impossible to open one’s eyes without\r\nseeing it on every hand, woven into the very fabric of daily existence.\r\nIt is easy to lose sight of the wonderful when once familiar with it,\r\nand we usually fail to give the full measure of positive appreciation to\r\nthe great things of this great age. They burst upon our vision at first\r\nlike flashing meteors; we marvel at them for a little while, and then we\r\naccept them as facts, which soon become so commonplace and so fused into\r\nthe common life as to be only noticed by their omission.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate them let us briefly contrast the conditions of to-day with\r\nthose of a hundred years ago. This is no easy task, for the comparison\r\nnot only involves the experiences of two generations, but it is like the\r\njuxtaposition of a star with the noonday sun, whose superior brilliancy\r\nobliterates the lesser light. But reverse the wheels of progress, and\r\nlet us make a quick run of one hundred years into the past, and what are\r\nour experiences? Before we get to our destination we find the wheels\r\nthemselves beginning to thump and jolt, and the passage becomes more\r\ndifficult, more uncomfortable, and so much slower. We are no longer\r\ngliding along in a luxurious palace car behind a magnificent locomotive,\r\ntraveling on steel rails, at sixty miles an hour, but we find ourselves\r\nnearing the beginning of the Nineteenth Century in a rickety, rumbling,\r\ndusty stage-coach. Pause! and consider the change for a moment in some\r\nof its broader aspects. First, let us examine the present more closely,\r\nfor the average busy man, never looking behind him for comparisons, does\r\nnot fully appreciate or estimate at its real value the age in which he\r\nlives. There are to-day (statistics of 1898), 445,064 miles of railway\r\ntracks in the world. This would build seventeen different railway\r\ntracks, of two rails each, around the entire world, or would girdle\r\nmother earth with thirty-four belts of steel. If extended in straight\r\nlines, it would build a track of two rails to the moon, and more than a\r\nhundred thousand miles beyond it. The United States has nearly half of\r\nthe entire mileage of the world, and gets along with 36,746 locomotives,\r\nnearly as many passenger coaches, and more than a million and a quarter\r\nof freight cars, which latter, if coupled together, would make nearly\r\nthree continuous trains reaching across the American continent from the\r\nAtlantic to the Pacific Ocean. The movement of passenger trains is\r\nequivalent to dispatching thirty-seven trains per day around the world,\r\nand the freight train movement is in like manner equal to dispatching\r\nfifty-three trains a day around the world. Add to this the railway\r\nbusiness controlled by other countries, and one gets some idea of how\r\nfar the stage-coach has been left behind. To-day we eat supper in one\r\ncity, and breakfast in another so many hundreds of miles east or west as\r\nto be compelled to set our watches to the new meridian of longitude in\r\norder to keep our engagement. But railroads and steam-cars constitute\r\nonly one of the stirring elements of modern civilization. As we make the\r\nbackward run of one hundred years we have passed by many milestones of\r\nprogress. Let us see if we can count some of them as they disappear\r\nbehind us. We quickly lose the telephone, phonograph and graphophone. We\r\nno longer see the cable-cars or electric railways. The electric lights\r\nhave gone out. The telegraph disappears. The sewing machine, reaper, and\r\nthresher have passed away, and so also have all india-rubber goods. We\r\nno longer see any photographs, photo-engravings, photolithographs, or\r\nsnap-shot cameras. The wonderful octuple web perfecting printing press;\r\nprinting, pasting, cutting, folding, and counting newspapers at the rate\r\nof 96,000 per hour, or 1,600 per minute, shrinks at the beginning of the\r\ncentury into an insignificant prototype. We lose all planing and\r\nwood-working machinery, and with it the endless variety of sashes,\r\ndoors, blinds, and furniture in unlimited variety. There are no\r\ngas-engines, no passenger elevators, no asphalt pavement, no steam fire\r\nengine, no triple-expansion steam engine, no Giffard injector, no\r\ncelluloid articles, no barbed wire fences, no time-locks for safes, no\r\nself-binding harvesters, no oil nor gas wells, no ice machines nor cold\r\nstorage. We lose air engines, stem-winding watches, cash-registers and\r\ncash-carriers, the great suspension bridges, and tunnels, the Suez\r\nCanal, iron frame buildings, monitors and heavy ironclads, revolvers,\r\ntorpedoes, magazine guns and Gatling guns, linotype machines, all\r\npractical typewriters, all pasteurizing, knowledge of microbes or\r\ndisease germs, and sanitary plumbing, water-gas, soda water fountains,\r\nair brakes, coal-tar dyes and medicines, nitro-glycerine, dynamite and\r\nguncotton, dynamo electric machines, aluminum ware, electric\r\nlocomotives, Bessemer steel with its wonderful developments, ocean\r\ncables, enameled iron ware, Welsbach gas burners, electric storage\r\nbatteries, the cigarette machine, hydraulic dredges, the roller mills,\r\nmiddlings purifiers and patent-process flour, tin can machines, car\r\ncouplings, compressed air drills, sleeping cars, the dynamite gun, the\r\nMcKay shoe machine, the circular knitting machine, the Jacquard loom,\r\nwood pulp for paper, fire alarms, the use of anæsthetics in surgery,\r\noleomargarine, street sweepers, Artesian wells, friction matches, steam\r\nhammers, electro-plating, nail machines, false teeth, artificial limbs\r\nand eyes, the spectroscope, the Kinetoscope or moving pictures,\r\nacetylene gas, X-ray apparatus, horseless carriages, and--but, enough!\r\nthe reader exclaims, and indeed it is not pleasant to contemplate the\r\nloss. The negative conditions of that period extend into such an\r\nappalling void that we stop short, shrinking from the thought of what it\r\nwould mean to modern civilization to eliminate from its life these\r\npotent factors of its existence.\r\n\r\nReturning to the richness and fullness of the present life, we shall\r\nfirst note chronologically the milestones and finger boards which mark\r\nthis great tramway of progress, and afterward consider separately the\r\nmore important factors of progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY OF LEADING INVENTIONS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1800--Volta’s Chemical Battery for producing Electricity.

To save time is to\r\nlive long, and this in a pre-eminent degree is accomplished by the\r\ntelegraph. Of all the inventions which man has called into existence to\r\naid him in the fulfillment of his destiny, none so closely resembles man\r\nhimself in his dual quality of body and soul as the telegraph. It too\r\nhas a body and soul. We see the wire and the electro-magnet, but not the\r\nvital principle which animates it. Without its subtile, pulsating,\r\nintangible spirit, it is but dead matter. But vitalized with its\r\nimmortal soul it assumes the quality of animated existence, and through\r\nits agency thought is extended beyond the limitations of time and space,\r\nand flashes through air and sea around the world. Its moving principle\r\nflows more silently than a summer’s zephyr, and yet it rises at times to\r\nan angry and deadly crash in the lightning stroke. At once powerful and\r\nelusive, it remained for Professor Morse to capture this wild steed,\r\nand, taming it, place it in the permanent service of man. On May 24,\r\n1844, there went over the wires between Washington and Baltimore the\r\nfirst message--“What hath God wrought?” This was both prayer and praise,\r\nand no more lofty recognition of the divine power and beneficence could\r\nhave been made. It was indeed the work of God made manifest in the hands\r\nof His children.\r\n\r\nPopular estimation has always credited Prof. Morse with the invention of\r\nthe telegraph, but to ascribe to him all the praise would do great\r\ninjustice to many other worthy workers in this field, some of whom are\r\nregarded by the best judges to be entitled to equal praise.\r\n\r\nThe practical telegraph as originally used is resolvable into four\r\nessential elements, viz., the battery, the conducting wire, the\r\nelectro-magnet, and the receiving and transmitting instruments.\r\n\r\nThe development of the battery began with Galvani in 1790, and Volta in\r\n1800. Galvani discovered that a frog’s legs would exhibit violent\r\nmuscular contraction when its exposed nerves were touched with one metal\r\nand its muscles were touched with another metal, the two metals being\r\nconnected. The effect was due to an electric current generated and\r\nacting with contractile effect on the muscles of the frog’s legs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nFrom this phenomenon, the chemical action of acids upon metals and the\r\nproduction of an electric current were observed, and the voltaic pile\r\nwas invented. This consisted of alternate discs of copper and zinc,\r\nseparated by layers of cloth steeped in an acidulated solution. This was\r\nthe invention of Volta. From this grew the Daniell battery, invented in\r\n1836 by Prof. Daniell of London, quickly followed by those of Grove,\r\nSmee, and others. These batteries were more constant or uniform in the\r\nproduction of electricity, were free from odors, and did not require\r\nfrequent cleaning, as did the plates of the voltaic pile, which were\r\nimportant results for telegraphic purposes. The Daniell battery in its\r\noriginal form employed an acidulated solution of sulphate of copper in a\r\ncopper cell containing a porous cup, and a cylinder of amalgamated zinc\r\nin the porous cup and surrounded by a weak acid solution. In the\r\nillustration, which shows a slightly modified form, a cruciform rod of\r\nzinc within a porous cup is surrounded by a copper cell, the whole being\r\nenclosed within a glass jar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--DANIELL’S BATTERY.]\r\n\r\nThe second element of the telegraph--the conducting wire--was scarcely\r\nan invention in itself, and the fact that electricity would act at a\r\ndistance through a metal conductor had been observed many years before\r\nthe Morse telegraph was invented. In 1823, however, Weber discovered\r\nthat a copper wire which he had carried over the houses and church\r\nsteeples of Göttingen from the observatory to the cabinet of Natural\r\nPhilosophy, required no special insulation. This was an important\r\nobservation in the practical construction of telegraph lines. One of\r\neven greater importance, however, was that of Prof. Steinheil, of\r\nMunich, who, in 1837, made the discovery of the practicability of using\r\nthe earth as one-half, or the return section, of the electric conductor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--PROF. HENRY’S INTENSITY MAGNET.]\r\n\r\nThe third element of the telegraph is the electro-magnet. This, and its\r\narrangement as a relay in a local circuit, was a most important\r\ninvention, and contributed quite as much to the success of the telegraph\r\nas did the inventions of Prof. Morse. It may be well to say that an\r\nelectro-magnet is a magnet which attracts an iron armature when an\r\nelectric current is sent through its coil of wire, and loses its\r\nattractive force when the circuit is cut off, thereby rendering it\r\npossible to produce mechanical effects at a distance through the agency\r\nof electrical impulses only. For the electro-magnet the world is chiefly\r\nindebted to Prof. Joseph Henry, formerly of Princeton, N. J., but later\r\nof the Smithsonian Institution. In 1828 he invented the energetic modern\r\nform of electro-magnet with silk covered wire wound in a series of\r\ncrossed layers to form a helix of multiple layers around a central soft\r\niron core, and in 1831 succeeded in making practical the production of\r\nmechanical effects at a distance, by the tapping of a bell by a rod\r\ndeflected by one of his electro-magnets. This experiment may be\r\nconsidered the pioneer step of the telegraph.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.\r\n\r\nHENRY.\r\n\r\nSTURGEON.\r\n]\r\n\r\nGreat as was the work of Prof. Henry, he must share the honors with a\r\nnumber of prior inventors who made the electro-magnet possible.\r\nElectro-magnetism, the underlying principle of the electro-magnet, was\r\nfirst discovered in 1819 by Prof. Oersted, of Copenhagen. In 1820\r\nSchweigger added the multiplier. Arago in the same year discovered that\r\na steel rod was magnetized when placed across a wire carrying an\r\nelectric current, and that iron filings adhered to a wire carrying a\r\nvoltaic current and dropped off when the current was broken.

Ampere\r\nsubstituted a helix for the straight wire, and Sturgeon, of England, in\r\n1825 made the real prototype of the electro-magnet by winding a piece of\r\nbare copper wire in a single coil around a varnished and insulated iron\r\ncore of a horse shoe form, but the powerful and effective electro-magnet\r\nof Prof. Henry is to-day an essential part of the telegraph, is in\r\nuniversal use, and is the foundation of the entire electrical art. It is\r\nunfortunate that Prof. Henry did not perpetuate the records of his\r\ninventions in patents, to which he was opposed, for there is good reason\r\nto believe that he was also the original inventor of the important\r\narrangement of the electro-magnet as a relay in local circuit, and other\r\nfeatures, which have been claimed by other parties upon more enduring\r\nevidence, but perhaps with less right of priority.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--MORSE’S FIRST MODEL PENDULUM INSTRUMENT.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth and great final addition to the telegraph which crowned it\r\nwith success was the Morse register and alphabetical code, the invention\r\nof Prof. Samuel F. B. Morse, of Massachusetts. Prof. Morse’s invention\r\nwas made in 1832, while on board ship returning from Europe. He set up\r\nan experimental line in 1835, and got his French patent October 30,\r\n1838, and his first United States patent June 20, 1840, No. 1647. In\r\n1844 the United States Congress appropriated $30,000 to build a line\r\nfrom Baltimore to Washington, and on May 24, 1844, the notable message,\r\n“What Hath God wrought?” went over the wires.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--THE MORSE CODE.]\r\n\r\nMorse’s first model, his pendulum instrument of 1837, is illustrated in\r\nFig. 5. A pendulum carrying a pencil was in constant contact with a\r\nstrip of paper drawn beneath the pencil. As long as inactive the pencil\r\nmade a straight line. The pendulum carried also an armature, and an\r\nelectro-magnet was placed near the armature. A current passed through\r\nthe magnet would draw the pendulum to one side. On being released the\r\npendulum would return, and in this way zigzag markings, as shown at 4\r\nand 5, would be produced on the strip of paper, which formed the\r\nalphabet. A different alphabet, known as the Morse Code, was\r\nsubsequently adopted by Morse, and in 1844 the receiving register shown\r\nat Fig. 7 was adopted, which finally assumed the form shown at Fig. 8.\r\n\r\nThe alphabet consisted simply of an arrangement of dots and dashes in\r\nvarying sequence. The register is an apparatus operated by the combined\r\neffects of a clock mechanism and electro-magnet. Under a roll, see Fig.\r\n8, a ribbon of paper is drawn by the clockwork. A lever having an\r\narmature on one end arranged over the poles of an electro-magnet,\r\ncarries on the other end a point or stylus. When an electric impulse is\r\nsent over the line the electro-magnet attracts the armature, and the\r\nstylus on the other end of the lever is brought into contact with the\r\npaper strip, and makes an indented impression. A short impulse gives a\r\ndot, and a long impulse holds the stylus against the paper long enough\r\nto allow the clock mechanism to pull the paper under the stylus and make\r\na dash. By the manipulation of a key for closing the electric circuit\r\nthe short or long impulse may be sent, at the pleasure of the operator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--MORSE RECEIVER.]\r\n\r\nThis constituted the completed invention of the telegraph, and on\r\ncomparing the work of Profs. Henry and Morse, it is only fair to say\r\nthat Prof. Henry’s contribution to the telegraph is still in active use,\r\nwhile the Morse register has been practically abandoned, as no expert\r\ntelegrapher requires the visible evidence of the code, but all rely now\r\nentirely upon the sound click of the electro-magnet placed in the local\r\ncircuit and known as a sounder, the varying time lengths of gaps between\r\nthe clicks serving every purpose of rapid and intelligent communication.\r\nThe invention of the telegraph has been claimed for Steinheil, of\r\nMunich, and also for Cooke and Wheatstone, in England, but few will\r\ndeny that it is to Prof. Morse’s indefatigable energy and inventive\r\nskill, with the preliminary work of Prof. Henry, that the world to-day\r\nowes its great gift of the electric telegraph, and with this gift the\r\nworld’s great nervous forces have been brought into an intimate and\r\nsensitive sympathy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--PERFECTED MORSE REGISTER.]\r\n\r\nWhenever an invention receives the advertisement of public approval and\r\ncommercial exploitation, the development of that invention along various\r\nlines follows rapidly, and so when practical telegraphic communication\r\nwas solved by Henry, Morse, and others, further advances in various\r\ndirections were made. Efforts to increase the rapidity in sending\r\nmessages soon grew into practical success, and in 1848 _Bain’s Chemical\r\nTelegraph_ was brought out. (U. S. Pats. No. 5,957, Dec. 5, 1848, and\r\nNo. 6,328, April 17, 1849.) This employed perforated strips of paper to\r\neffect automatic transmission by contact made through the perforations\r\nin place of the key, while a chemically prepared paper at the opposite\r\nend of the line was discolored by the electric impulses to form the\r\nrecord. This was the pioneer of the automatic system which by later\r\nimprovements is able to send over a thousand words a minute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--HOUSE PRINTING TELEGRAPH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--STOCK BROKER’S “TICKER,” WITH GLASS COVER\r\nREMOVED.]\r\n\r\nIn line with other efforts to increase the capacity of the wires, the\r\n_duplex telegraph_ was invented by Dr. William Gintl, of Austria, in\r\n1853, and was afterwards improved by Carl Frischen, of Hanover, and by\r\nJoseph B. Stearns, of Boston, Mass, who in 1872 perfected the duplex (U.\r\nS. Pats. No. 126,847, May 14, 1872, and No. 132,933, Nov. 12, 1872).\r\nThis system doubles the capacity of the telegraphic wire, and its\r\nprinciple of action permits messages sent from the home station to the\r\ndistant station to have no effect on the home station, but full effect\r\non the distant station, so that the operators at the opposite ends of\r\nthe line may both telegraph over the same wire, at the same time, in\r\nopposite directions. This system has been further enlarged by the\r\nquadruplex system of Edison, which was brought out in 1874 (and\r\nsubsequently developed in U. S. Pat. No. 209,241, Oct. 22, 1878). This\r\nenabled four messages to be sent over the same wire at the same time,\r\nand is said to have increased the value of the Western Union wires\r\n$15,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 Royal C. House invented the _printing telegraph_, which printed\r\nthe message automatically on a strip of paper, something after the\r\nmanner of the typewriter (U. S. Pat. No. 4,464, April 18, 1846). The\r\ningenious mechanism involved in this was somewhat complicated, but its\r\nresults in printing the message plainly were very satisfactory. This was\r\nthe prototype of the familiar “_ticker_” of the stock broker’s office,\r\nseen in Figs. 10 and 11. In 1856 the Hughes printing telegraph was\r\nbrought out (U. S. Pat. No. 14,917, May 20, 1856), and in 1858 G. M.\r\nPhelps combined the valuable features of the Hughes and House systems\r\n(U. S. Pat. No. 26,003, Nov. 1, 1859).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--RECEIVING MESSAGE ON STOCK BROKER’S “TICKER.”]\r\n\r\n_Fac Simile_ telegraphs constitute another, although less important\r\nbranch of the art. These accomplished the striking result of reproducing\r\nthe message at the end of the line in the exact handwriting of the\r\nsender, and not only writing, but exact reproductions of all outlines,\r\nsuch as maps, pictures, and so forth, may be sent. The fac simile\r\ntelegraph originated with F. C. Bakewell, of England, in 1848 (Br. Pat.\r\nNo. 12,352, of 1848).\r\n\r\nThe Dial Telegraph is still another modification of the telegraph. In\r\nthis the letters are arranged in a circular series, and a light needle\r\nor pointer, concentrically pivoted, is carried back and forth over the\r\nletters, and is made to successively point to the desired letters.\r\n\r\nAmong other useful applications of the telegraph is the _fire alarm\r\nsystem_. In 1852 Channing and Farmer, of Boston, Mass., devised a\r\nsystem of telegraphic fire alarms, which was adopted in the city of\r\nBoston (U. S. Pat. No. 17,355, May 19, 1857), and which in varying\r\nmodifications has spread through all the cities of the world,\r\nintroducing that most important element of time economy in the\r\nextinguishment of fires. Hundreds of cities and millions of dollars have\r\nbeen thus saved from destruction.\r\n\r\nSimilar applications of local alarms in great numbers have been extended\r\ninto various departments of life, such as _District Messenger Service_,\r\n_Burglar Alarms_, _Railroad-Signal Systems_, _Hotel-Annunciators_, and\r\nso on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--TELEGRAPHING BY INDUCTION.]\r\n\r\nFor furnishing current for telegraphic purposes the dynamo, and\r\nespecially the storage battery, have in late years found useful\r\napplication. In fact, in the leading telegraph offices the storage\r\nbattery has practically superseded the old voltaic cells.\r\n\r\n_Telegraphing by induction_, _i. e._, without the mechanical connection\r\nof a conducting wire, is another of the developments of telegraphy in\r\nrecent years, and finds application to telegraphing to moving railway\r\ntrains. When an electric current flows over a telegraph line, objects\r\nalong its length are charged at the beginning and end of the current\r\nimpulse with a secondary charge, which flows to the earth if connection\r\nis afforded. It is the discharge of this secondary current from the\r\nmetal car roof to the ground which, on the moving train, is made the\r\nmeans of telegraphing without any mechanical connection with the\r\ntelegraph lines along the track. As, however, this secondary circuit\r\noccurs only at the making and breaking of the telegraphic impulse, the\r\nlength of the impulse affords no means of differentiation into an\r\nalphabet, and so a rapid series of impulses, caused by the vibrator of\r\nan induction coil, is made to produce buzzing tones of various duration\r\nrepresenting the alphabet, and these tones are received upon a telephone\r\ninstead of a Morse register. The diagram, Fig. 12,[1] illustrates the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n  [1] From “Electricity in Daily Life,” by courtesy of Charles\r\n      Scribner’s Sons.\r\n\r\nTo receive messages on a car, electric impulses on the telegraph wire W,\r\nsent from the vibrator of an induction coil, cause induced currents as\r\nfollows: Car roof R, wire _a_, key K, telephone _b c_, car wheel and\r\nearth. In sending messages closure of key K works induction coil I C,\r\nand vibrator V, through battery B, and primary circuit _d_, _c_, _f_,\r\n_g_, and the secondary circuit _a_, _h_, _i_, charges the car roof and\r\ninfluences by induction the telegraph wire W and the telephone at the\r\nreceiving station.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 William W. Smith proposed the plan of communicating between\r\nmoving cars and a stationary wire by induction (U. S. Pat. No. 247,127,\r\nSept. 13, 1881). Thomas A. Edison, L. J. Phelps, and others have further\r\nimproved the means for carrying it out. In 1888 the principle was\r\nsuccessfully employed on 200 miles of the Lehigh Valley Railroad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY, INTERNATIONAL YACHT RACES,\r\nOCTOBER, 1899.]\r\n\r\n_Wireless Telegraphy_, or telegraphing without any wires at all, from\r\none point to another point through space, is the most modern and\r\nstartling development in telegraphy. To the average mind this is highly\r\nsuggestive of scientific imposition, so intangible and unknown are the\r\nphysical forces by which it is rendered possible, and yet this is one of\r\nthe late achievements of the Nineteenth Century. Many scientists have\r\ncontributed data on this subject, but the principles and theories have\r\nonly begun to crystallize into an art during the first part of the last\r\ndecade of the Nineteenth Century. Heinrich Hertz, the German scientist,\r\nwas perhaps the real pioneer in this line in his studies and\r\nobservations of the nature of the electric undulations which have taken\r\nhis name, and are known as “Hertzian” waves, rays, or oscillations.\r\nTesla in the United States, Branly and Ducretet in France, Righi in\r\nItaly, the Russian savant, Popoff, and Professor Lodge, of England, have\r\nall made contributions to this art. It will aid the understanding to\r\nsay, in a preliminary way, that electric undulations are generated and\r\nemitted from a plate or conductor a hundred feet or more high in the\r\nair, are thence transmitted through space to a remote point, which may\r\nbe many miles away, and there influencing a similar plate high in the\r\nair give, through a special form of receiving device known as a\r\n“coherer,” a telegraphic record. The “coherer,” invented by Branly in\r\n1891, is a glass tube containing metal filings between two circuit\r\nterminals. The electric waves cause these filings to cohere, and so vary\r\nthe resistance to the passage of the current as to give a basis for\r\ntransformation into a record.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1899, Signor Guglielmo Marconi, an Italian student, then\r\nresiding in England, successfully communicated between South Foreland,\r\nCounty of Kent, and Boulogne-sur-mer, in France, a distance of\r\nthirty-two miles across the English Channel. Signor Marconi used the\r\nvertical conductors and the Hertz-oscillation principle, and his system\r\nis described in his United States patent. No. 586,193, July 13, 1897.\r\n\r\nHis patent comprehends many claims, a leading feature of which is the\r\nmeans for automatically shaking the “coherer” to break up the cohesion\r\nof the metal filings as embodied in his first claim, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “In a receiver for electrical oscillations, the combination of an\r\n    imperfect electrical contact, a circuit through the contact, and\r\n    means actuated by the circuit for shaking the contact.”\r\n\r\nThe Marconi system of wireless telegraphy was practically employed with\r\nuseful effect April 28, 1899, on the “Goodwin Sands” light-ship to\r\ntelegraph for assistance when in collision twelve miles from land and in\r\ndanger of sinking. It was also used in October, 1899, on board the\r\n“Grande Duchesse” to report the international yacht race between the\r\n“Columbia” and the “Shamrock” at Sandy Hook, as seen in Fig. 13. Lord\r\nRoberts also made good use of it in his South African campaign against\r\nthe Boers. According to Signor Marconi its present range is limited to\r\neighty-six miles, but it is expected that this will be soon extended to\r\n150 miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13A.--THE COHERER.]\r\n\r\nMarconi’s receiving apparatus is shown in Fig. 13A, and consists of a\r\nsmall glass tube called the coherer, about 1½ inches in length, into the\r\nends of which are inserted two silver pole pieces, which fit the tube,\r\nbut whose ends are 1/50 inch apart. The space between the ends is filled\r\nwith a mixture composed of fine nickel and silver filings and a mere\r\ntrace of mercury, and the other ends of the pole pieces are attached to\r\nthe wires of a local circuit. In the normal condition the metallic\r\nfilings have an enormous resistance, and constitute a practical\r\ninsulator, preventing the flow of the local current; but if they are\r\ninfluenced by electric waves, coherence takes place and the resistance\r\nfalls, allowing the local current to pass. The coherence will continue\r\nuntil the filings are mechanically shaken, when they will at once fall\r\napart, as it were, insulation will be established, and the current will\r\nbe broken. If, then, a coherer be brought within the influence of the\r\nelectric waves thrown out from a transmitter, coherence will occur\r\nwhenever the key of the transmitter at the distant station is depressed.\r\nMr. Marconi has devised an ingenious arrangement, which is the subject\r\nof his patent referred to, in which a small hammer is made to rap\r\ncontinuously upon the coherer by the action of the local circuit, which\r\nis closed when the Hertzian waves pass through the metal filings. As\r\nsoon as the waves cease, the hammer gives its last rap, and the tube is\r\nleft in the decohered condition ready for the next transmission of\r\nwaves. It is evident that by making the local circuit operate a relay,\r\nin the circuit of which is a standard recording instrument, the messages\r\nmay be recorded on a tape in the usual way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13B.--DIAGRAM OF THE TRANSMITTER AND RECEIVER.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 13B is shown the diagram of circuits. The letters _d d_ indicate\r\nthe spheres of the transmitter, which are connected, one to the vertical\r\nwire w, the other to earth, and both by wires _c′ c′_, to the terminals\r\nof the secondary winding of induction coil, c. In the primary circuit is\r\nthe key _b_. The coherer _j_ has two metal pole pieces, _j¹ j²_,\r\nseparated by silver and nickel filings. One end of the tube is connected\r\nto earth, the other to the vertical wire _w_, and the coherer itself\r\nforms part of a circuit containing the local cell _g_, and a sensitive\r\ntelegraph relay actuating another circuit, which circuit works a\r\ntrembler _p_, of which _o_ is the decohering tapper, or hammer. When the\r\nelectric waves pass from _w_ to _j¹ j²_ the resistance falls, and the\r\ncurrent from _g_ actuates the relay _n_, the choking coils _k k′_, lying\r\nbetween the coherer and the relay, compelling the electric waves to\r\ntraverse the coherer instead of flowing through the relay. The relay _n_\r\nin its turn causes the more powerful battery _r_ to pass a current\r\nthrough the tapper, and also through the electro-magnet of the\r\nrecording instrument _h_.\r\n\r\nThe alternate cohering by the waves and decohering by the tapper\r\ncontinue uninterruptedly as long as the transmitting key at the distant\r\nstation is depressed. The armature of the recording instrument, however,\r\nbecause of its inertia, cannot rise and fall in unison with the rapid\r\ncoherence and decoherence of the receiver, and hence it remains down and\r\nmakes a stroke upon the tape as long as the sending key is depressed.\r\n\r\nThe principal applications of wireless telegraphy so far have been at\r\nsea, where the absence of intervening obstacles gives a free path to the\r\nelectrical oscillations. The system is also applicable on land, however,\r\nand no one can doubt that if the Ministers of the Legations shut up in\r\nPekin had been supplied with a wireless telegraphy outfit, neither the\r\nwalls of Pekin nor the strongest cordon of its Chinese hordes could have\r\nprevented the long sought communication. The full story of mystery and\r\nmassacre would have been promptly made known, and the civilized world\r\nhave been spared its anxiety, and earlier and effective measures of\r\nrelief supplied.\r\n\r\nAs the art of telegraphy grows apace toward the end of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury, individuality of invention becomes lost in the great maze of\r\nmodifications, ramifications, and combinations. Inventions become merged\r\ninto systems, and systems become swallowed up by companies. In the\r\npromises of living inventors the wish is too often father to the\r\nthought, and the conservative man sees the child of promise rise in\r\ngreat expectation, flourish for a few years, and then subside to quiet\r\nrest in the dusty archives of the Patent Office. They all contribute\r\ntheir quota of value, but it is so difficult to single out as\r\npre-eminent any one of those which as yet are on probation, that we must\r\nleave to the coming generation the task of making meritorious selection.\r\n\r\nTo-day the telegraph is the great nerve system of the nation’s body, and\r\nit ramifies and vitalizes every part with sensitive force. In 1899 the\r\nWestern Union Telegraph Company alone had 22,285 offices, 904,633 miles\r\nof wire, sent 61,398,157 messages, received in money $23,954,312, and\r\nenjoyed a profit of $5,868,733. Add to this the business of the Postal\r\nTelegraph Company and other companies, and it becomes well nigh\r\nimpossible to grasp the magnitude of this tremendous factor of\r\nNineteenth Century progress. Figures fail to become impressive after\r\nthey reach the higher denominations, and it may not add much to either\r\nthe reader’s conception or his knowledge to say that the statistics for\r\nthe _whole world_ for the year 1898 show: 103,832 telegraph offices,\r\n2,989,803 miles of wire, and 365,453,526 messages sent during that year.\r\nThis wire would extend around the earth about 120 times, and the\r\nmessages amounted to one million a day for every day in that year. This\r\nis for land telegraphs only, and does not include cable messages.\r\n\r\nWhat saving has accrued to the world in the matter of time, and what\r\ndevelopment in values in the various departments of life, and what\r\ncontributions to human comfort and happiness the telegraph has brought\r\nabout, is beyond human estimate, and is too impressive a thought for\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE ATLANTIC CABLE.\r\n\r\n    DIFFICULTIES OF LAYING--CONGRATULATORY MESSAGES BETWEEN QUEEN\r\n    VICTORIA AND PRESIDENT BUCHANAN--THE SIPHON RECORDER--STATISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the applications of the telegraph which deserve special mention\r\nfor magnitude and importance is the Atlantic Cable. For boldness of\r\nconception, tireless persistence in execution, and value of results,\r\nthis engineering feat, though nearly a half century old, still\r\nchallenges the admiration of the world, and marks the beginning of one\r\nof the great epochs of the Nineteenth Century. It was not so brilliant\r\nin substantive invention, as it added but little to the telegraph as\r\nalready known, beyond the means for insulating the wires within a gutta\r\npercha cable, but it was one of the greatest of all engineering works.\r\nIt was chiefly the result of the energy and public spirit of Mr. Cyrus\r\nW. Field, an eminent American citizen. Three times was its laying\r\nattempted before success crowned the work. The first expedition sailed\r\nAugust 7, 1857, and consisted of a fleet of eight vessels, four American\r\nand four English, starting from Valentia on the Irish coast. On August\r\n11 the cable parted, and 344 miles of the cable were lost in water two\r\nmiles deep. In 1858 a renewal of the effort to lay the cable was made.\r\nImprovements were added in the paying out machinery, and a different\r\nmanner of coiling the enormous load of cable on the vessels was resorted\r\nto, and provisions also were made to protect the propeller from contact\r\nwith the cable. On June 10 the telegraphic fleet steamed out of Plymouth\r\nharbor. It consisted of the U. S. frigate “Niagara,” with the\r\npaddle-wheel steamer “Valorous” as a tender, and the British frigate\r\n“Agamemnon,” with the paddle-wheel steamer “Gorgon” as a tender. After\r\nthree days at sea, terrible gales were encountered and much damage\r\nresulted. The vessels were to proceed to midocean, and the portions of\r\nthe cable carried by the “Niagara” and “Agamemnon” were to be spliced,\r\nand the two vessels were then to sail in opposite directions to their\r\nrespective coasts. The first splice was made on the 26th of June. After\r\npaying out two and a half miles each, the cable parted. Again meeting\r\nand splicing, forty miles each were paid out, and the cable again\r\nparted. On the 28th another splicing was effected, and 150 miles each\r\nwere paid out, and again the cable parted, and the expedition had to be\r\nabandoned. After much financial embarrassment and adverse criticism, the\r\ncourageous and public-spirited directors who had control of the\r\nenterprise dispatched another expedition, which sailed July 17, 1858.\r\nThe two vessels, “Niagara” and “Agamemnon,” with their tenders,\r\nproceeded to midocean, and following the same method of connecting the\r\nends of their respective cable sections, they sailed in opposite\r\ndirections. On August 5, 1858, Mr. Cyrus Field announced by telegram\r\nfrom Trinity Bay, on the coast of Newfoundland, that Trinity Bay in\r\nAmerica, and Valentia in Ireland, 2,134 miles apart, had been connected,\r\nand the great Atlantic cable was an established fact.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--ORIGINAL ATLANTIC CABLE, FULL SIZE.\r\n\r\nConsists of seven copper wires (4) to form the conductor, a wrapping (3)\r\nof thread, soaked in tallow and pitch, several layers (2) of gutta\r\npercha, all surrounded by a protecting coat of mail (1) of twisted\r\nwires.]\r\n\r\nOn August 16, 1858, the first message came over from Queen Victoria to\r\nPresident Buchanan of the United States, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “_To the President of the United States, Washington:_\r\n\r\n     “The Queen desires to congratulate the President upon the\r\n     successful completion of this great international work, in which\r\n     the Queen has taken the deepest interest.\r\n\r\n     “The Queen is convinced that the President will join with her in\r\n     fervently hoping that the Electric Cable which now connects Great\r\n     Britain with the United States will prove an additional link\r\n     between the nations whose friendship is founded upon their common\r\n     interest and reciprocal esteem.\r\n\r\n     “The Queen has much pleasure in thus communicating with the\r\n     President, and renewing to him her wishes for the prosperity of the\r\n     United States.”\r\n\r\nto which the President replied as follows:\r\n\r\n    “WASHINGTON CITY, Aug. 16, 1858.\r\n\r\n     “_To Her Majesty Victoria, Queen of Great Britain:_\r\n\r\n     “The President cordially reciprocates the congratulations of Her\r\n     Majesty, the Queen, on the success of the great international\r\n     enterprise accomplished by the science, skill, and indomitable\r\n     energy of the two countries. It is a triumph more glorious,\r\n     because far more useful to mankind, than was ever won by conqueror\r\n     on the field of battle.\r\n\r\n     “May the Atlantic Telegraph, under the blessing of Heaven, prove to\r\n     be a bond of perpetual peace and friendship between the kindred\r\n     nations, and an instrument destined by Divine Providence to diffuse\r\n     religion, civilization, liberty and law throughout the world. In\r\n     this view will not all nations of Christendom spontaneously unite\r\n     in the declaration that it shall be forever neutral, and that its\r\n     communications shall be held sacred in passing to their places of\r\n     destination, even in the midst of hostilities?\r\n\r\n(Signed)\r\n\r\n“JAMES BUCHANAN.”\r\n\r\nGreat rejoicing on both sides of the ocean followed, and the public\r\nprint was filled with accounts of the enterprise. The following\r\nselection from the _Atlantic Monthly_ of October, 1858, is an apostrophe\r\nin lofty sentiments of verse, which to-day stirs the Twentieth Century\r\nheart as a joyous prophecy fulfilled:\r\n\r\n    Thou lonely Bay of Trinity,\r\n      Ye bosky shores untrod,\r\n    Lean, breathless, to the white-lipped sea\r\n      And hear the voice of God!\r\n\r\n    From world to world His couriers fly,\r\n      Thought-winged and shod with fire;\r\n    The angel of His stormy sky\r\n      Rides down the sunken wire.\r\n\r\n    What saith the herald of the Lord?\r\n      “The world’s long strife is done!\r\n    Close wedded by that mystic cord,\r\n      Her continents are one.\r\n\r\n    “And one in heart, as one in blood,\r\n      Shall all her peoples be;\r\n    The hands of human brotherhood\r\n      Shall clasp beneath the sea.\r\n\r\n    “Through Orient seas, o’er Afric’s plain,\r\n      And Asian mountains borne,\r\n    The vigor of the Northern brain\r\n      Shall nerve the world outworn.\r\n\r\n    “From clime to clime, from shore to shore,\r\n      Shall thrill the magic thread;\r\n    The new Prometheus steals once more\r\n      The fire that wakes the dead.\r\n\r\n    “Earth, gray with age, shall hear the strain\r\n      Which o’er her childhood rolled;\r\n    For her the morning stars again\r\n      Shall sing their song of old.\r\n\r\n    “For, lo! the fall of Ocean’s wall,\r\n      Space mocked and Time outrun!\r\n    And round the world the thought of all\r\n      Is as the thought of one!”\r\n\r\n    O, reverently and thankfully\r\n      The mighty wonder own!\r\n    The deaf can hear, the blind may see,\r\n      The work is God’s alone.\r\n\r\n    Throb on, strong pulse of thunder! beat\r\n      From answering beach to beach!\r\n    Fuse nations in thy kindly heat,\r\n      And melt the chains of each!\r\n\r\n    Wild terror of the sky above,\r\n      Glide tamed and dumb below!\r\n    Bear gently, Ocean’s carrier dove,\r\n      Thy errands to and fro!\r\n\r\n    Weave on, swift shuttle of the Lord,\r\n      Beneath the deep so far,\r\n    The bridal robe of Earth’s accord,\r\n      The funeral shroud of war!\r\n\r\n    The poles unite, the zones agree,\r\n      The tongues of striving cease;\r\n    As on the Sea of Galilee,\r\n      The Christ is whispering, “Peace!”\r\n\r\nAfter a few months of working, the cable became inoperative, but its\r\nsuccess was a demonstrated fact, and in 1866 a new cable was laid by the\r\naid of that monster steamer “The Great Eastern,” since which time the\r\ncable has become one of the great factors of modern civilization.\r\n\r\nProbably the most important of the inventions relating to submarine\r\ntelegraphs is the siphon recorder, invented by Sir William Thompson, now\r\nLord Kelvin (U. S. Pat. No. 156,897, Nov. 17, 1874). It is called a\r\nsiphon recorder because the record is made by a little glass siphon down\r\nwhich a flow of ink is maintained like a fountain pen. This siphon is\r\nvibrated by the electric impulses to produce on the paper strip a zigzag\r\nline, whose varying contour is made to represent letters. In the\r\nillustration, Fig. 15, _m_ is an ink well, _o_ a strip of paper, and _n_\r\nthe ink siphon, one end of which is bent and dips down into the ink\r\nwell, and the other end of which traces the record on the moving paper\r\nstrip _o_. The siphon is sustained on a vertical axis _l_, and its\r\nlateral vibration is effected as follows: A light rectangular coil _b\r\nb_, of exceedingly fine insulated wire, is suspended between the poles N\r\nS of a powerful electro-magnet energized by a local battery. In the\r\ncoil _b b_ is a stationary soft iron core _a_, magnetized by the poles N\r\nS. The coil _b b_ is suspended upon a vertical axis consisting of a fine\r\nwire _f f_, and the delicate electrical impulses over the submarine\r\ncable enter the coil _b b_ through the axial wire _f f_ as a conductor,\r\nand cause a greater or less oscillation of the coil _b b_ between the\r\npoles N S of the electro-magnet. The coil _b b_ is connected by a thread\r\n_k_ to the siphon, and pulls the siphon in one direction, while the\r\nsiphon is pulled in the opposite direction by a helical spring attached\r\nto an arm on the siphon axis _l_. The jagged lines seen in Fig. 16 spell\r\nthe words “siphon recorder.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--SIPHON RECORDER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--SIPHON RECORDER MESSAGE.]\r\n\r\nTo-day there lie in submerged silence, but pulsating with the life of\r\nthe world, no less than 1,500 submarine telegraphs. Their aggregate\r\nlength is 170,000 miles; their total estimated cost is $250,000,000, and\r\nthe number of messages annually transmitted over them is 6,000,000.\r\nThirteen cables work daily across the Atlantic, and an additional one is\r\nbeing laid from Germany. Messages now go across the Atlantic and are\r\nreceived on the siphon recorder at the rate of fifty words a minute,\r\nand at a cost of twenty-five cents a word. Our guns may thunder in the\r\nPhilippines, and the news by cable, traveling faster than the earth on\r\nits axis, may reach the Western Hemisphere under the paradoxical\r\ncondition of several hours earlier than it occurred. Cablegrams to\r\nManila cost $2.38 a word, and the cable tolls for our War Department\r\nalone are costing at the rate of $325,000 a year. The logical outcome is\r\na Pacific cable, a bill for which, connecting San Francisco and\r\nHonolulu, has already passed the United States Senate.\r\n\r\nMessages from the Executive Mansion at Washington to the battlefield at\r\nSantiago were sent and responses received within twelve minutes, while a\r\nmessage dispatched from the House of Representatives in Washington to\r\nthe House of Parliament in London, in the chess match of 1898, was\r\ntransmitted and a reply received in thirteen and one-half seconds.\r\n\r\nTo-day the cable with the still small voice, more divine than human,\r\nspeaks with one accent to all the nations of the earth. Differing though\r\nthey may in tongue and skin, in thought and religion, in physical\r\ndevelopment and clime, the telegraph speaks to them all alike, and by\r\nall is understood. Truly it fulfils the prophecy so gracefully expressed\r\nin the verses quoted, and has become the common bond of union among the\r\nnations of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE DYNAMO AND ITS APPLICATIONS.\r\n\r\n    OBSERVATIONS OF FARADAY AND HENRY--MAGNETO-ELECTRIC MACHINES OF\r\n    PIXII AND OF SAXTON--HJORTH’S DYNAMO OF 1855--WILDE’S MACHINE OF\r\n    1866--SIEMENS’ OF 1867--GRAMME’S OF 1870--TESLA’S POLYPHASE\r\n    CURRENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last thirty-five years of the Nineteenth Century there has grown\r\nup into the full stature of mechanical majority this stalwart son of\r\nelectrical lineage. As the means for furnishing electrical power it\r\nstands to-day the great fountain head of electrical generation, and in\r\nits peculiar field ranks as of equal importance with the steam engine.\r\nUntil about 1865 the voltaic battery, which generated electricity by\r\nchemical decomposition, was practically the only means for producing\r\nelectricity for industrial and commercial purposes. It was through its\r\nagency that the telegraph, the electric light, and many other\r\ndiscoveries in electricity were made and rendered possible. Its cost and\r\nlimited amount of current, however, restricted the limits of its\r\npractical application, and although its current could furnish beautiful\r\nlaboratory experiments, its mechanical work was more in the nature of\r\nillustration than utilization. But with the advent of the dynamo\r\nelectricity has taken a new and very much larger place in the commercial\r\nactivities of the world. It runs and warms our cars, it furnishes our\r\nlight, it plates our metals, it runs our elevators, it electrocutes our\r\ncriminals; and a thousand other things it performs for us with secrecy\r\nand dispatch in its silent and forceful way. But what is a dynamo? To\r\nthe average mind the most satisfactory answer would be--that it is\r\nsimply a machine which converts mechanical power into electricity.\r\nAttach a dynamo to a steam engine, and the power of the steam engine\r\nwill, through the dynamo, become transformed or converted into a\r\npowerful electric current. Any other source of mechanical power, such as\r\na water wheel, gas engine, wind wheel, or even a horse or man, will\r\nserve to operate the dynamo; its primary and sole function being to take\r\npower and convert it into electricity.\r\n\r\nThe stepping stone to the dynamo in its development was the\r\n_magneto-electrical machine_. This is a machine founded upon the general\r\nprinciple observed by Faraday in 1831 and 1832, and also by Prof. Henry\r\nabout the same time, that when a magnet is made to approach a helix of\r\ninsulated wire it causes a current of electricity to flow in the helix\r\nas long as the magnet advances. If the magnet is passed through the\r\nhelix, the current is reversed as soon as the magnet passes the middle\r\npoint. The principle is the same if the magnet be made to approach and\r\nrecede from the poles of an electro-magnet having a helix wound around a\r\nsoft iron core. Likewise the same result occurs if the electro-magnet\r\nwith its helix is made to approach and recede from a permanent magnet,\r\nthe current in the helix flowing in one direction when it approaches the\r\npermanent magnet, and in the opposite direction when leaving the said\r\nmagnet. The movement of the two elements in relation to each other\r\nrequires some force to overcome the repellent and attractive actions,\r\nand this force is converted into electrical energy. This is the\r\nprinciple of the magneto-electric machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--PIXII MAGNETO-ELECTRIC MACHINE, 1832.]\r\n\r\nSaxton in the United States and Pixii in France were the first to\r\nproduce organized devices of this class for generating electricity from\r\nmagnetism. Pixii’s machine (1832) consisted of a permanent horse-shoe\r\nmagnet which was caused to revolve in proximity to an armature upon\r\nwhich was wound a coil of insulated wire. On March 30, 1852, Sonnenberg\r\nand Rechten obtained a United States patent, No. 8,843, for an\r\nelectrical machine for killing whales, and on August 19, 1856, Shepard\r\nobtained U. S. Pat. No. 15,596 for the machine which came to be known as\r\nthe “Alliance” machine. Both of these machines had permanent field\r\nmagnets, and were early types of magneto-electric machines. The\r\nefficiency of these magneto-electric machines was necessarily limited to\r\nthe strength of the inducing field magnets, which, being permanent\r\nmagnets, were a positive and fixed factor. It was an easy step to\r\nsubstitute electro-magnets for permanent magnets, as the field or\r\ninducing magnets, and also to excite the (electro) field magnet by\r\nvoltaic batteries, but the important step which resulted in the machine\r\nwhich is called the “dynamo” (from the Greek “Δυναμις”--power) was yet\r\nto come.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--HJORTH’S DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--HJORTH’S DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE, PLAN VIEW.]\r\n\r\nThis step consisted in taking the current induced in the revolving helix\r\nor armature (by the field magnets) and sending it back through the coils\r\nof the field magnets which produced it, thereby increasing the energy of\r\nthe field magnet coils, and they in turn with an increased efficiency\r\nand reciprocal action induce still stronger currents in the armature\r\ncoils, and so a building up process, or principle of mutual and\r\nreciprocal excitation, is carried on until the maximum efficiency is\r\nreached. This principle was the discovery of Soren Hjorth, of\r\nCopenhagen, and is fully described in his British patent, No. 806 of\r\n1855, for “An Improved Magneto-Electric Battery.” As the prototype of\r\nthe dynamo, it is worthy of illustration. In the illustration, Figs. 18\r\nand 19, _a_ is a revolving wheel bearing the armature coils, _C_\r\npermanent magnets, _d_ electro-magnets (field magnets), and _g_ the\r\ncommutator. Quoting from his specifications, he says: “The permanent\r\nmagnets acting on the armatures brought in succession between their\r\npoles, induce a current in the coils of the armatures, which current,\r\nafter having been caused by the commutator to flow in one direction,\r\npasses round the electro-magnets (field magnets), charging the same and\r\nacting on the armatures. By the mutual action between the\r\nelectro-magnets and the armatures an accelerating force is obtained,\r\nwhich in result produces electricity greater in quantity and intensity\r\nthan has heretofore been obtained by similar means.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the principle of the dynamo was clearly embodied in the Hjorth\r\npatent, its value was not appreciated until some time later. Eleven\r\nyears later Wilde (U. S. Pat. No. 59,738, Nov. 13, 1866), employed a\r\nsmall machine with permanent magnets to excite the coil-wound field\r\nmagnets of a larger machine. But Siemens (British Pat. No. 261 of 1867),\r\ntaking up the principle employed by Hjorth, dispensed with his\r\nsuperfluous permanent magnets, having found that the residual magnetism,\r\nwhich always remained in iron which has once been magnetized, was\r\nsufficient as a basis to start the building up process. Farmer,\r\nWheatstone and Varley also recognized this fact about the same time.\r\nSiemens’ patent also was the first embodiment of what is known as the\r\nbobbin armature. Gramme and D’Ivernois (British Pat. 1,668 of 1870, and\r\nU. S. Pat. No. 120,057, of Oct. 17, 1871), were the first to bring out\r\nthe continuously wound ring armature.\r\n\r\nActive development now began in various types and by various inventors,\r\nincluding Weston, Brush, Edison, Thomson and Houston, Westinghouse, and\r\nothers, who have brought the dynamo to its present high efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe revolving coils of the dynamo are called the armature, and the fixed\r\nelectro-magnets are called the field magnets, and these latter may be\r\ntwo or more in number. When two are used they are arranged on opposite\r\nsides of the armature, and form what is known as the bipolar machine. A\r\nlarger number constitutes the multipolar machine. The field magnets in\r\nthe multipolar machine usually are arranged in radial position around\r\nthe entire circumference of the revolving armature, and are held in a\r\nfixed circular frame. To give a clear idea of the principles of the\r\ndynamo, the bipolar machine is best suited for illustration, and is here\r\ngiven in Figs. 20 and 21, in which Fig. 20 represents the dynamo\r\ncomplete, and Fig. 21 a detail of the end of the armature and\r\ncommutator. This armature consists of coils or bobbins of insulated\r\nwire, each section having its terminals connected with separate\r\ninsulated plates on the hub, which plates are known as the commutator.\r\nWhen any section of the armature approaches the pole of a field magnet,\r\nthe current induced in that section of the armature coils by the field\r\nmagnet, is taken off from a corresponding plate of the commutator by\r\nflat springs, seen in Fig. 20, and known as brushes. The field magnets A\r\nand B, Fig. 20, are shown with only a few turns of wire about them for\r\nclearer illustrations of the connections, which are made as follows: The\r\nwire _a_ is extended in coils around the field magnet B, and thence\r\naround field magnet A, and thence to the upper brush on the commutator,\r\nthence through the wire coils or bobbins of the rotary armature C, and\r\nthence by the lower brush to the wire _b_. The terminals of the wires\r\n_a_ and _b_ extend to the point of utilization of the current, whether\r\nthis be electric lights, motors, or other applications. In this\r\nillustration, the circuit, it will be seen, passes through both the\r\ncoils of the field magnets and the coils of the armature, involving the\r\nprinciple of mutual excitation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--BIPOLAR DYNAMO.]\r\n\r\nThere are two principal kinds of dynamos--those producing the\r\nalternating currents, and those producing the continuous current. In the\r\nfirst the current alternates in direction, or is composed of an infinite\r\nnumber of impulses of opposite polarity: one polarity when a section of\r\nthe armature coil is approaching a north field magnet pole or receding\r\nfrom a south pole, and the other polarity when receding from a north\r\nfield magnet pole and approaching a south pole. In the continuous\r\ncurrent machine, the commutator and brushes are so arranged as to take\r\nup all the impulses of the same polarity and conduct them away by one\r\nbrush, and gathering all the impulses of the opposite polarity and\r\nconducting them away by another brush. Thus the current of each brush,\r\nin the continuous current machine, is always of the same polarity, and\r\nthe polarity of one being always positive, and that of the other\r\nnegative, the current flows continuously in the same direction. A third\r\nspecies of dynamo is the pulsatory, in which the current flow is\r\ninvariable in direction, but proceeds in waves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--ARMATURE OF BIPOLAR DYNAMO.]\r\n\r\nA change in the character of the current generated by the dynamo is made\r\nby what is known as the “transformer,” in which the principle of the\r\ninduction coil is made available. In this way, for instance, the high\r\npotential currents generated by the powerful water wheels at Niagara\r\nFalls are taken twenty miles to Buffalo, and are there transformed into\r\nother currents of lower potential, suited to incandescent lighting and\r\nother various uses. A similar scheme is in process of fulfillment in the\r\nestablishment of a water power electric plant near Conowingo, Maryland,\r\non the Susquehanna River, to furnish electrical power to Baltimore,\r\nWilmington and Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nAn important development in electrical generation and transmission is to\r\nbe found in what is known as the _polyphase_, _multiphase_, or\r\n_rotating_ current, pioneer patents for which were granted to Tesla May\r\n1, 1888, Nos. 381,968, 381,969, 382,279, 382,280, 382,281 and 382,282.\r\n\r\nRealizing the possibilities of the dynamo, the Legislature of New York\r\nin 1888 passed a law, which went into effect in 1889, in that State,\r\nsubstituting death by electricity for the hangman’s noose. The criminal\r\nis strapped in the chair, seen in Fig. 22, one terminal of the wire from\r\nthe dynamo is strapped upon his forehead, and the other to anklets on\r\nhis legs, and like a flash of lightning the deadly energy of the dynamo\r\nperforms its work.\r\n\r\nNot the least of the applications of the dynamo is its use in\r\nelectro-metallurgy for plating metals, and also for promoting chemical\r\nreactions. The electric furnace, stimulated into higher heat by the\r\ndynamo than can be otherwise obtained, has brought about many valuable\r\ndiscoveries, and made great advances in various arts. The metal\r\naluminum, and the hard abrasive or polishing and grinding material known\r\nas “carborundum” are the products of the electric furnace, and so is the\r\nproduct known as “calcium carbide,” which, when immersed in water, gives\r\noff acetylene gas and is a product now universally used for that\r\npurpose, and rapidly increasing in commercial importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--ELECTROCUTION CHAIR.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 23 is seen the Acheson electric furnace for producing\r\ncarborundum. The electric current traverses the furnace through a series\r\nof horizontal electrodes at each end, and highly heats a central core of\r\ncarbon, which is disposed in a mass of silicious and carbonaceous\r\nmaterial, and which latter is converted by the heat into silicide of\r\ncarbon, or carborundum. In Fig. 24 is shown a continuous electric\r\nfurnace constructed as a revolving wheel, under the Bradley patents. Rim\r\nsections 5 are placed on the wheel on one side and filled with a mixture\r\nof carbon and lime, through which the electric current is passed from\r\nthe dynamo _g_. The heat of the current fuses the mass and converts it\r\ninto calcium carbide, and as the wheel slowly revolves the rim sections\r\n5 are removed from the opposite side, and the mass of calcium carbide,\r\nseen at _x_, is broken off. The electrolytic production of copper\r\nthrough the agency of the dynamo amounts to 150,000 tons annually, and\r\nthe commercial reduction of aluminum by the electric furnace has grown\r\nfrom eighty-three pounds in 1883 to 5,200,000 pounds in 1898, and its\r\ncost has been reduced to about 33 cents per pound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--PART SECTIONAL VIEW OF CARBORUNDUM FURNACE.]\r\n\r\nThe storage battery, holding in reserve its stored up electric energy,\r\nalso owes its practical value entirely to the dynamo which charges it,\r\nand thus makes available a portable source of supply.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--BRADLEY ELECTRIC FURNACE FOR PRODUCING CALCIUM\r\nCARBIDE.]\r\n\r\nTo contemplate the dynamo with its clumsy, enormous spools, it suggests\r\nto the imagination of the average observer the gigantic toy of some\r\nBrobdingnagian boy--but the dynamo is no toy. It is the most compact,\r\nbusiness-like, and dangerous of all utilitarian devices. To touch its\r\nbrushes may be instant death, for the dynamo is the prison house of the\r\nlightning, and resents intrusion. Hidden away from public gaze in some\r\nsequestered power house, and working night and day like some tireless,\r\ndumb, and mighty genii, it sends its magnetic thrills of force silently\r\nthrough the many miles of wire extending like radii from some great\r\nnerve center through the conduits in our streets, and stretching from\r\npole to pole like giant cobwebs through the air. Responding to its\r\nforce, thousands of little incandescent threads leap into radiant\r\nbrightness and shed their mellow and genial light in our offices, our\r\nstores, hotels, and homes. Brilliant arc lamps, rivaling the sun in\r\npower, make night into day, and produce along our streets coruscations,\r\nsilhouettes, and dancing shadows in spectacular and unceasing pageants.\r\nFrom the towering lighthouses of our coasts its beams are thrown\r\nseaward, and a beacon for the mariner shines beyond all other lights.\r\nThe great search light of our ships is in itself but a hollow mockery\r\nuntil the dynamo whispers in its ear the word “light!” and then its\r\nbeam, reaching for miles along the horizon, discovers a stealthy enemy,\r\nor signals the safe return to port. The mighty force of the dynamo\r\nentering the electric motors on the street cars turns the wheels and\r\ntransports its load with scarcely a passenger inside realizing how it is\r\nall done. The same energy turns the electric fan, and with kindly\r\nservice soothes the weary sufferer, and at another place remorselessly\r\ntakes the life of the condemned criminal. The dynamo is one of the great\r\nfactors of modern civilization, and its potential name, like that of\r\n“dynamite,” rightly defines its character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--MODERN MULTIPOLAR DYNAMO.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRIC MOTOR.\r\n\r\n    BARLOW’S SPUR WHEEL--DAL NEGRO’S ELECTRIC PENDULUM--PROF.

The genesis of\r\nthe electric motor began in 1821 with Faraday’s observation of the\r\nphenomenon of the conversion of an electric current into mechanical\r\nmotion. In his experiment a copper wire was supported in a vertical\r\nposition so as to dip into a cup of mercury, while a small bar magnet\r\nwas anchored at one end by a thread to the bottom of the cup and floated\r\nin the mercury in upright position. The mass of mercury being connected\r\nto one pole of a battery, and the vertical wire to the other, it was\r\nfound that when the circuit was completed by clipping the wire into the\r\nmercury, the floating bar magnet would revolve around the wire as a\r\ncenter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--BARLOW’S WHEEL.]\r\n\r\nIn 1826 Barlow, of Woolwich, made his electrical spur wheel, Fig. 26,\r\nand in 1830 the Abbe Dal Negro, in Padua, is said to have constructed a\r\nsort of vibrating electrical pendulum, both of which devices were crude\r\nforms of magnetic engines. Dal Negro’s machine, see Fig. 27, consisted\r\nof a magnet A, movable about an axis situated about one-third of its\r\nlength, and the upper extremity of which was capable of oscillating\r\nbetween the two branches of an electro-magnet E. A current being sent\r\ninto the electro-magnet, passed through an eight-cupped mercurial\r\ncommutator C, which the oscillating magnet controlled by means of a rod\r\n_t_ and a fork F. When the magnet had been attracted toward one of the\r\npoles of the electro-magnet this very motion of attraction acting upon\r\nthe commutator changed the direction of the current, and the magnet was\r\nrepelled toward the other branch of the electro-magnet, and so on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--DAL NEGRO’S ELECTRIC MOTOR.]\r\n\r\nIn 1828 Prof. Joseph Henry produced his energetic electro-magnets\r\nsustaining weights of some thousands of pounds, and gave prophetic\r\nsuggestion of the possibilities of electricity as a motive power. In\r\n1831 he devised the electric motor shown in Fig. 28, which is described\r\nin Prof. Henry’s own words as follows:\r\n\r\n“A B is the horizontal magnet, about seven inches long, and movable on\r\nan axis at the center; its two extremities when placed in a horizontal\r\nline are about one inch from the north poles of the upright magnets C\r\nand D. G and F are two large tumblers containing diluted acid, in each\r\nof which is immersed a plate of zinc surrounded with copper; _l m s t_\r\nare four brass thimbles soldered to the zinc and copper of the batteries\r\nand filled with mercury.\r\n\r\n“The galvanic magnet A B is wound with three strands of copper bell\r\nwire, each about twenty-five feet long; the similar ends of these are\r\ntwisted together so as to form two stiff wires _q r_, which project\r\nbeyond the extremity B, and dip into the thimbles _s t_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--PROF. HENRY’S ELECTRIC MOTOR.]\r\n\r\n“To the wires _q r_ two other wires are soldered so as to project in an\r\nopposite direction, and dip into the thimbles _l m_. The wires of the\r\ngalvanic magnet have thus, as it were, four projecting ends; and by\r\ninspecting the figure it will be seen that the extremity _p_, which dips\r\ninto the cup _m_, attached to the copper of the battery in G,\r\ncorresponds to the extremity _r_ which dips into the cup _t_,\r\nconnecting, with the zinc in battery F. When the batteries are in\r\naction, if the end B is depressed until _q r_ dips into the cups _s t_,\r\nA B instantly becomes a powerful magnet, having its north pole at B;\r\nthis, of course, is repelled by the north pole D, while at the same time\r\nit is attracted by C; the position is consequently changed, and _o p_\r\ncomes in contact with the mercury in _l m_; as soon as the communication\r\nis formed, the poles are reversed, and the position again changed. If\r\nthe tumblers be filled with strong diluted acid, the motion is at first\r\nvery rapid and powerful, but it soon almost entirely ceases. By\r\npartially filling the tumblers with weak acid, and occasionally adding a\r\nsmall quantity of fresh acid, a uniform motion, at the rate of\r\nseventy-five vibrations in a minute, has been kept up for more than an\r\nhour; with a large battery and very weak acid the motion might be\r\ncontinued for an indefinite length of time.”\r\n\r\nFollowing Prof. Henry came Sturgeon’s rotary motor of 1832, Jacobi’s\r\nrotary motor of 1834, Fig. 29, which had electro-magnets both in the\r\nfield and armature; Davenport’s motor of 1834, Zabriskie’s motor of\r\n1837, in which a vibrating magnet converted reciprocating into rotary\r\nmotion; Davenport’s motor of 1837 (U.

No. 7,287, April 16, 1850); the Neff\r\nmotor of 1851 (U. S. Pat. No. 7,889, Jan. 7, 1851), of which\r\nillustration is given in Fig. 31, and Page’s motor of 1854 (U. S. Pat.\r\nNo. 10,480, Jan. 31, 1854). In 1835 Davenport constructed a small\r\ncircular railway at Springfield, Mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--JACOBI’S ROTARY ELECTRIC MOTOR.]\r\n\r\nIn 1839 Prof. Jacobi, with the aid of Emperor Nicholas, applied his\r\nelectric motor to a boat 28 feet long, carrying fourteen passengers, and\r\npropelled the same at a speed of three miles an hour. About the same\r\ntime Robert Davidson, a Scotchman, experimented with an electric railway\r\ncar sixteen feet long, weighing six tons, and attaining a speed of four\r\nmiles an hour. In 1840 Davenport, by means of his electric motor,\r\nprinted a news sheet called the _Electro Magnet and Mechanics’\r\nIntelligencer_. In 1851 an electric locomotive made by Dr. Page in\r\naccordance with his subsequent patent of 1854, drew a train of cars from\r\nWashington to Bladensburg at a rate of nineteen miles an hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--DAVENPORT MOTOR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--NEFF MOTOR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC MOTOR.]\r\n\r\nAll these motors were operated by voltaic batteries, and on account of\r\nthe cost of the latter but little practical use of the electric motor\r\nwas made until the dynamo was invented. In 1873 an accidental\r\ndiscovery led to the rapid practical development of the electric motor.\r\nIt is said that at the industrial exhibition at Vienna in that year, a\r\nnumber of Gramme dynamos were being placed in position, and a workman\r\nin making the electrical connections for one of these machines,\r\ninadvertently connected it to another dynamo in active operation, and\r\nwas surprised to find that the dynamo he was connecting began to revolve\r\nin the opposite direction. This was the clue that led to the important\r\nrecognition of the structural identity of the dynamo and the modern\r\ntype of electric motor. The dynamo and the electric motor then grew into\r\ndevelopment together, and the same inventors who brought the dynamo to\r\nits present high efficiency, produced electric motors of corresponding\r\nprinciples and value. In the illustration, Fig. 32, is shown a modern\r\nelectric motor. It is a Westinghouse two-phase machine, of 300 horse\r\npower, of the self starting induction type, designed to operate at a\r\nspeed of 500 revolutions per minute when supplied with two-phase\r\ncurrents of 3,000 alternations per minute and 2,000 volts pressure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--SIEMENS’ FIRST ELECTRIC RAILWAY.]\r\n\r\nThe most important application of the electric motor is for street car\r\noperation. The first electric railway was that of Dr. Werner Siemens, at\r\nBerlin, in 1879, an illustration of which is given in Fig. 33. The first\r\nelectric railway in America was installed at Baltimore in 1885, and ran\r\nto Hampden, a distance of two miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--OVERHEAD TROLLEY CAR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--UNDERGROUND ELECTRIC TROLLEY SYSTEM.]\r\n\r\nThe familiar overhead trolley cars, and the far superior conduit trolley\r\nsystem, represent perhaps the largest use made of electric motors. The\r\nmotors are arranged under the cars in varying forms adapted to the\r\nstructure of the car. In the overhead trolley, shown in Fig. 34, the\r\ncurrent is taken from the overhead wire by a flexible trolley pole, and\r\nin the conduit system a trolley known as a plow extends from the bottom\r\nof the car through a narrow slot in the top of the conduit and makes a\r\ntraveling contact with the conductor rails within the conduit, which\r\ncarry the electric current. Fig. 35 is an end view of a street car of\r\nthe latter type, with the conduit and conductor rails in cross section.\r\nThe current goes from one rail to one bearing surface of the plow,\r\nthence to the motor on the car and back to the other bearing surface of\r\nthe plow and the other conductor rail in the conduit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--THIRD RAIL SYSTEM ON THE N. Y., N. H. & H.\r\nRAILROAD--FRONT END OF MOTOR CAR.]\r\n\r\nA third system, which has supplanted to some extent the use of steam on\r\nshort line railways, is the so-called third rail system, of which an\r\nexample is seen in Fig. 36. A third conductor rail is placed between the\r\nusual track rails, and from this conductor the current is taken by a\r\nsliding shoe on the car, and carried to the motor and thence through the\r\ncar wheels to the track rails. To reduce danger from the live rail, the\r\nthird rail in some systems is made in sections, and, by an automatic\r\nswitching process as the car moves along, only the sections of the rail\r\nbeneath the car are brought into circuit, all other portions being cut\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe use of electric motors has greatly extended, cheapened, and\r\nexpedited the street car service. All the principal thoroughfares of\r\ncities and even towns are now so equipped, and radiating suburban lines\r\nextend for miles from the city, affording for five cents a pleasant and\r\ncheap excursion for the poor to the green fields and fresh air of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--ELECTRIC RAILWAY MOTOR, CLOSED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--ELECTRIC RAILWAY MOTOR, OPENED.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 37 and 38 show an electric motor used on street cars, as made by\r\nthe General Electric Company. Externally it presents the appearance of\r\nsome curious, uncouth, cast iron box, which, to the uninitiated, piques\r\nthe curiosity, and when opened adds no explanation of its real\r\ncharacter. In it, however, the electrician finds a most interesting\r\ncombination of metal and magnetism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE OF B. & O. TUNNEL IN\r\nBALTIMORE.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 39 is shown one of the most powerful electric locomotives ever\r\nconstructed. It was built in 1895 by the General Electric Company for\r\nthe Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, to draw trains through the long tunnel\r\nfrom the Camden Street Station in Baltimore, for the purpose of avoiding\r\nsmoke and gas in the tunnel, which is 7,339 feet long. The locomotive\r\nweighs ninety-six tons, or twenty-five tons above the average steam\r\nlocomotive. It was designed to draw 100 trains daily each way, moving\r\npassenger trains of a maximum weight of 500 tons at thirty-five miles an\r\nhour, and freight trains of 1,200 tons at fifteen miles an hour. It has\r\ntwo trucks, and eight drive wheels of sixty-two inches diameter. There\r\nare four motors, two to each truck, each rated at 360 horse power.\r\n\r\nOther important applications of the electric motor are, the propelling\r\nof automobile carriages, small boats, and fish torpedoes, operating\r\nsteering gear for ships, passenger elevators, rock drills in mines,\r\nrunning printing presses, fans, sewing machines, graphophones, and in\r\nall applications where space is limited and cleanliness a desideratum.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mulhall there were in 1890 in the United States and Canada\r\nabout 645 miles of street railway operated by electricity. This about\r\nconcluded the first decade of the life of the electric railway. Some\r\nidea of the rapid increase in this field may be had by the statement of\r\nthe same authority that there were in 1890, at the end of this first\r\ndecade, forty-five additional electric railroads in course of\r\nconstruction, aggregating 512 miles of way, which nearly doubled the\r\nprevious existing mileage.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 it was estimated that there were in the United States 14,000\r\nmiles of electric railroads, with a nominal capital of $1,000,000,000,\r\nand employing 170,000 men. In the same year a single electrical contract\r\nwas entered into between the Third Avenue Railroad and the Union Railway\r\nCompany of New York, acting as one, and the Westinghouse Electrical and\r\nManufacturing Company, amounting to $5,000,000. This was for the\r\nelectrical equipment of their respective railway lines, and is the\r\nlargest electrical contract ever made. The change in equipment from\r\nother motive power to the electric is rapidly going on in all\r\ndirections, and the rapid succession of trains will doubtless cause it,\r\nfor passenger traffic on short lines, to eventually supersede steam.\r\n\r\nThe eighth annual report of the General Electric Company shows for the\r\nyear 1899 orders received for railway and other electrical equipment\r\namounting to $26,323,626; goods shipped, $22,379,463.75; profit on same,\r\n$3,805,860.18. The growth of its business from 1893 to 1899 shows the\r\nfollowing per cent. of increase: In 1893, 36 per cent. above 1892; in\r\n1894, 126 per cent. above 1893; in 1895, 10 per cent. above 1894; in\r\n1896, 60 per cent. above 1895; in 1897, 60 per cent. above 1896; in\r\n1898, 21 per cent. above 1897; in 1899, 51 per cent. above 1898.\r\n\r\nThe capitalization in electrical appliances in the United States in 1898\r\nis estimated at $1,900,000,000, most of which is devoted to industries\r\nin which the electric motor is used. The export of electrical apparatus\r\nfrom this country amounts to more than three million dollars annually,\r\nand it is said that there are eight times as many electric railways in\r\nthe United States as in all the rest of the world combined.\r\n\r\nThe use of electrical current in twelve principal cities in the United\r\nStates was distributed in 1898 as follows:\r\n\r\nLamps, arcs, and motors in sixteen candle power equivalents.\r\n\r\n  Boston                  616,000\r\n  New York              1,718,000\r\n  Chicago               1,278,000\r\n  Brooklyn                322,000\r\n  Baltimore               224,000\r\n  Philadelphia            488,000\r\n  St. Louis               303,000\r\n  San Francisco           231,000\r\n  Buffalo                 125,000\r\n  Rochester               184,000\r\n  Cincinnati              201,000\r\n  New Orleans              81,000\r\n\r\nBoston makes the largest use of electrical current in proportion to its\r\npopulation of any city in the world. Rochester is next. Both of these\r\ncities employ in electrical units of 16 c. p. equivalents, more than one\r\nelectric lamp for every man, woman and child in their respective\r\npopulations.\r\n\r\nThe dynamo and the electric motor have together wrought this great\r\ndevelopment. The dynamo takes mechanical power and converts it into\r\nelectrical energy, and the electric motor takes the electrical energy\r\nand converts it back into mechanical power. Standing behind them both,\r\nhowever, is the steam engine, and these three afford a beautiful\r\nillustration of the law of correlation of forces. The force starts with\r\nthe combustion of coal under the boiler of the steam engine. When carbon\r\nunites chemically with oxygen, it is an exothermic reaction that gives\r\noff heat as correlated energy. The influence of heat on the molecules of\r\nwater in the boiler causes them, by repellent action, to assume the\r\nqualities of an elastic gas, and this expanding as steam drives the\r\npiston of the steam engine. The steam engine overcomes by force the\r\nresistance existing between the dynamo’s field magnets and armature\r\ncoil, and sets up in the latter the correlated force of an electric\r\ncurrent, and the electric current, traveling to its remote destination\r\nby suitable conductors, enters the coils of the electric motor in\r\nreverse relation to that of the dynamo, and in producing the reverse\r\neffect between the armature and field magnets, electrical energy is\r\nconverted back into mechanical power. It is not possible to obtain in\r\nthe electric motor the full equivalent of the dynamo’s current, nor in\r\nthe dynamo the full equivalent of the steam engine’s power, nor in the\r\nsteam engine the full equivalent of the chemical energy in the\r\ncombustion of coal. Loss by radiation, by conduction, by friction, and\r\nby electrical resistance precludes this, but while there is loss in a\r\nutilitarian sense there is no real loss, for force like matter, is\r\nindestructible, and the proof of this universal law by Joule, in 1843,\r\nconstitutes one of the highest triumphs of philosophy and one of the\r\nmost important discoveries of the Nineteenth Century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRIC LIGHT.\r\n\r\n    VOLTAIC ARC BY SIR HUMPHREY DAVY--THE JABLOCHKOFF CANDLE--PATENTS OF\r\n    BRUSH, WESTON AND OTHERS--SEARCH LIGHTS--GROVE’S FIRST INCANDESCENT\r\n    LAMP--STARR-KING LAMP--MOSES FARMER LIGHTS FIRST DWELLING WITH\r\n    ELECTRIC LAMPS--SAWYER-MAN LAMP--EDISON’S INCANDESCENT LAMP--\r\n    EDISON’S THREE-WIRE SYSTEM OF CIRCUITS--STATISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe popular idea of the electric light is, that it is a very recent\r\ninvention, since even the younger generation remembers when there was no\r\nsuch thing in general use. It will surprise many readers, then, to know\r\nthat the electric light had its birth in the first decade of the\r\nNineteenth Century. In 1809 Sir Humphrey Davy discovered that when two\r\npieces of charcoal, which formed the terminals of a powerful voltaic\r\nbattery, were separated after having been brought into contact with each\r\nother, at the moment of separation a brilliant arc of flame passed from\r\none piece of charcoal to the other, producing a temperature of 4,800°\r\nF., and that the intensity of the light exceeded all other known forms\r\nof light. Various improvements in the organization of devices were made\r\nfor holding the two pieces of carbon, which in time assumed the form of\r\ntwo pencils in alignment, as in Fig. 40, and devices were provided for\r\nfeeding one carbon toward the other as they burned away. Clock mechanism\r\nfor thus regulating the feed was first employed, which served to\r\nautomatically keep the carbons a definite distance apart, this being a\r\nnecessary condition of the arc. For many years, however, the use of such\r\na light was confined to laboratory illustration, for the reason that it\r\ncould only be produced at great expense by a large number of voltaic\r\nbatteries. Nevertheless very efficient electric lamps working by voltaic\r\nbatteries were devised by Foucault, Duboscq, Deleuil and others as early\r\nas 1853. With the advent of the dynamo, however, the electric light grew\r\nrapidly and developed into conspicuous use. Even before the true dynamo\r\nwas invented the magneto-electric machine was employed for producing an\r\nelectric current to supply electric light. The so-called “Alliance”\r\ngenerator was, in 1858, used in the South Foreland lighthouse in England\r\nto supply the arc lamps, and the beams of the electric light then, for\r\nthe first time, were turned seaward as a beacon for the mariner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--SIMPLE ELECTRIC ARC LAMP.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--JABLOCHKOFF CANDLE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--WESTON ARC LAMP.]\r\n\r\nAmong the early developments of the electric light was the Jablochkoff\r\ncandle, see Fig. 41, brought out in 1877. In this device two parallel\r\nsticks of carbon G G were separated by a non-conducting layer of kaolin\r\nI, and were held in an asbestos ferrule A. Metal tubes T T connected the\r\nconducting wires F F to the carbons. The arc of flame passed from the\r\ntop of one carbon to the other, fusing the separating layer of kaolin,\r\nand the whole burned down together as a candle. This form of electric\r\nlight was extensively used in Paris in 1877, and also in London, and\r\nattracted considerable attention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--ARC LAMP FEED MECHANISM.]\r\n\r\nFrom the Jablochkoff candle the arc light has resumed the form of two\r\nvertically aligned carbons, and after passing through various forms and\r\npatterns, of which the Weston lamp, Fig. 42, is a modern type, has come\r\ninto such universal and conspicuous use for lighting the streets of our\r\ncities, and is so well known to-day, that but little need be said of its\r\ndevelopment, since its real character has undergone no change in\r\nprinciple, the improvements relating chiefly to means for regulating the\r\nfeed of the carbons and maintaining them at a uniform distance apart, so\r\nas to avoid flickering. This result is obtained by automatic mechanism\r\noperated by the electric current acting upon electro-magnets, as shown\r\nin Fig. 43, in which the electro-magnets raise the upper carbon when it\r\nis too close to the lower carbon, and lower the upper carbon when the\r\nspace becomes too great from burning away. Among those who have\r\ncontributed to the development of the arc light the names of Brush,\r\nWeston, and Thomson and Houston are most conspicuous, and the patents of\r\nBrush, No. 203,411, May 7, 1878, and No. 212,183, Feb. 11, 1879, and\r\nWeston, No. 285,451, Sept. 25, 1883, are the most representative\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--NINE THOUSAND CANDLE POWER ARC LAMP.]\r\n\r\nThe applications of the arc light have been brilliant beyond the dreams\r\nof the most sanguine inventor. In the illustrations number 44, 45 and\r\n46, is shown a gigantic electric light beacon manufactured by Henry\r\nLepaute, of Paris, and first exhibited in this country at the Chicago\r\nWorld’s Fair, in 1893. It consists of two great lenses, each nine feet\r\nin diameter, between which, in their focus, is placed a 9,000 candle\r\npower arc light. The great lantern, Fig. 45, is carried by a vertical\r\nshaft, which terminates at its lower end in a hollow drum, which latter\r\nfloats in a bath of mercury. Although the weight is estimated at several\r\ntons, so sensitive is its poise on the mercury that the enormous lantern\r\nmay be easily rotated by the pressure of one’s finger. Each lens\r\nconsists of concentric segments, see Fig. 46, 190 in number, surrounding\r\na central disk, which together cause the rays to issue in parallel\r\nlines. The nine-foot beam of light thus projected is of 90,000,000\r\ncandle power, and if placed at a sufficient altitude to avoid the\r\ncurvature of the earth’s surface, its light would be visible at the\r\nrange of 146.9 nautical miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--NINETY MILLION CANDLE POWER BIVALVE LENS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--FRONT VIEW OF LENS.]\r\n\r\nBetter known to the patrons of our excursion boats and the visitors to\r\nour splendid battleships, are the electric search lights. The greatest\r\nexample of all search lights, however, is not to be found on the sea,\r\nbut in the picturesque altitudes of the Sierra Madres in Southern\r\nCalifornia. At the summit of Mount Lowe, in the neighborhood of\r\nPasadena, is the largest search light in the world, shown in\r\nillustration, Fig. 48. It is of 3,000,000 candle power, stands eleven\r\nfeet high, and its total weight is 6,000 pounds. Its light may be seen\r\nfor 150 miles out on the ocean, and as its powerful beam is thrown from\r\nmountain top to mountain top hundreds of miles apart, it adds the\r\nillumination of art to the sublimity of nature, and seems a fitting\r\njewel to this lofty crown of Mother Earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--SEARCH LIGHT WITH MACHINE GUN REPELLING NIGHT\r\nATTACK OF TORPEDO BOAT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--SEARCH LIGHT ON MOUNT LOWE, CALIFORNIA.]\r\n\r\nBrilliant as is the arc lamp, far more in evidence is the incandescent\r\nlamp. The little glass bulb with its tiny thread of light we find\r\neverywhere. Popular opinion and the decision of the courts accord this\r\ninvention to Thomas A. Edison. The evolution of the incandescent lamp\r\nis, however, interesting, and may be briefly sketched as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--FIRST INCANDESCENT LAMP, BY PROFESSOR GROVE,\r\n1840.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--STARR-KING LAMP.]\r\n\r\nIn 1845 there appeared in the _Philosophical Magazine_ a description of\r\nwhat was probably the first incandescent electric light. It was devised\r\nin 1840 by William Robert Grove, the inventor of the Grove battery, and\r\nis illustrated in Fig. 49. It is stated that he experimented and read by\r\nit for hours. It was described as follows:\r\n\r\n“A coil of platinum wire is attached to two copper wires, the lower\r\nparts of which, or those most distant from the platinum, are well\r\nvarnished; these are fixed erect in a glass of distilled water, and\r\nanother cylindrical glass, closed at the upper end, is inverted over\r\nthem, so that its open mouth rests on the bottom of the former glass;\r\nthe projecting ends of the copper wires are connected with a voltaic\r\nbattery (two or three pairs of the nitric acid combination), and the\r\nignited wire now gives a steady light. Instead of making the wires pass\r\nthrough the water, they may be fixed to metallic caps well luted to the\r\nnecks of a glass globe.”\r\n\r\nIn 1845 August King patented, in England, an incandescent lamp, having\r\nan unsealed platinum burner, and also a carbon in a vacuum. Mr. King\r\nacted as agent for an American inventor, Mr. Starr, and the lamp came\r\nto be known as the Starr-King lamp, shown in Fig. 50. The burner was a\r\nthin plate or pencil of carbon B, enclosed in a Torricellian vacuum at\r\nthe end of an inverted barometer tube, and held between the terminals of\r\nthe connecting wires leading to a battery. In 1859 Moses G. Farmer\r\nlighted his house at Salem, Mass., by a series of subdivided electric\r\nlights, which was the first private dwelling lighted by electricity, and\r\nprobably the first illustration of the feasibility of subdividing the\r\nelectric current through a number of electric lamps.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 William E. Sawyer applied for a United States patent for an\r\nelectric engineering and lighting system, and in January, 1878, entered\r\ninto a partnership with Albon Man, and the “Sawyer-Man” lamp, see Fig.\r\n51, was produced. In this an incandescent rod of carbon was inclosed in\r\nan atmosphere of nitrogen. This marked the beginning of a period of\r\ngreat activity in this field, which finally resulted in the well known\r\nform of electric lamp shown in Fig. 52, which was patented by Edison,\r\nNo. 223,898, January 27, 1880. The distinctive features of this lamp\r\nconsisted in a bowed filament of carbon of very thin, thread-like\r\ncharacter, which was made of paper or carbonized cellulose. This, when\r\nsealed in a vacuum, would not burn away, but would give the proper\r\nincandescence, and by its small transverse dimension and high\r\nresistance to the current, permitted a proper distribution of the\r\nelectric current to a number of lamps, without a special regulator for\r\neach lamp; and which could also be made so cheaply that the lamp could\r\nbe thrown away when the burner was finally broken. Edison’s claim on\r\nthis feature of the electric lamp was sharply contested in an\r\ninterference in the Patent Office by Sawyer and Man, with the decisions\r\nalternating first in favor of one and then of the other, but which\r\nfinally resulted in the grant of a patent to Sawyer and Man, on May 12,\r\n1885. A struggle then began in the courts, which on October 4, 1892,\r\nterminated in a decision by the United States Court of Appeals (Edison\r\nElectric Light Company vs. United States Lighting Company), awarding the\r\nincandescent lamp to Edison.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--SAWYER-MAN LAMP.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--EDISON’S ELECTRIC LAMP.\r\n\r\n_A_--Exhausted globe. _B_--Carbon filament. _CC_--Wires sealed in glass.\r\n_D_--Line of fusion of two parts of globe. _EF_--Insulating material.\r\n_G_--Screw-threads. _HI_--Metal socket. _J_--Fixture arm _K_--Circuit\r\ncontrolling key.]\r\n\r\nIn the early demonstration given by Edison great disturbance was caused\r\nin the stock exchanges among the holders of gas shares, as the\r\nsensational reportings in the press seemed to indicate that gas was to\r\nbe superseded entirely. This uneasiness on the London Stock Exchange\r\namounted on October 11, 1878, to a veritable panic, but while the\r\nelectric light has more than fulfilled the prophecy made for it in many\r\ndirections, gas shares still continue to be good stocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--ELECTRIC LIGHT CIRCUIT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--EDISON’S THREE WIRE SYSTEM OF ELECTRIC LIGHT\r\nCIRCUITS.]\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the practical use of the incandescent lamp is the\r\nmethod of supplying and regulating the current from the dynamo. Although\r\nthe alternating current is used for arc light, only the continuous\r\ncurrent can be used for the incandescent lights, and the relation of\r\nthe dynamo and the incandescent lamps is shown in Fig. 53, in which L\r\nrepresents the lamps between the main conducting wires leading from the\r\ndynamo, which latter has the coils of the field magnets arranged in a\r\nshunt or branch circuit, in which is interposed a regulator R in the\r\nform of a resistance coil with movable switch lever, by which more or\r\nless of the current is allowed to flow through the field magnet coils to\r\nsuit the work being done. In late years automatic regulators have been\r\nprovided for accomplishing this result. In Fig. 54 is shown what is\r\nknown as the Edison “three wire system,” patented March 20, 1883, No.\r\n274,290. In this two dynamos are used as at D¹ D², and the three wires\r\nemerge from the dynamos, one from the negative pole of one dynamo,\r\nanother from the positive pole of the other dynamo, and the third or\r\nmiddle one is connected to both the other poles (positive and negative),\r\nof the two dynamos. For purposes of illustration, this may be compared\r\nto a three-storied arrangement of current, the upper wire representing\r\nthe third story, the middle wire the second story, and the bottom one\r\nthe first story. The fall from either story to the next represents the\r\nworking energy, but from the top wire to the bottom would be equal to a\r\nfall from the third story to the first. The purpose of this arrangement\r\nis to save expense in copper wire, for while three main wires are used\r\ninstead of two, the aggregate weight of the wires (when the lamps are\r\narranged as shown), may be made so much less than two heavy wires as to\r\nmake a very great saving in copper.\r\n\r\nThe uses of the incandescent light are legion. Besides those which are\r\nof common observation it is used for lighting the interior of mines,\r\ncaves, and the dark apartments of ships, and does not foul the air. It\r\nis also used by divers in submarine operations; in the formation of\r\nadvertising signs, and in pyrotechnics, but perhaps one of the most\r\nextraordinary uses to which it has been put is in exploring the interior\r\nof the human stomach and other cavities of the body, a patent for which\r\nwas granted to M. C. F. Nitze, No. 218,055, July 29, 1879.\r\n\r\nWhen an electric lamp is arranged with the opposite ends of the carbon\r\nburner connected, one to the outgoing, the other to the incoming wires\r\nfrom a dynamo, so as to be bridged across, this arrangement is said to\r\nbe “in multiple” or “in parallel,” and the lamps bear the analogy of\r\nhorses drawing abreast, and when the opposite ends of the carbon burner\r\nare placed in a gap or break in either the outgoing or the incoming\r\nwire, the arrangement is said to be “in series,” and the lamps bear the\r\nanalogy of horses in tandem.\r\n\r\nExplanation of electric nomenclature can best be given by the analogy in\r\nhydrostatics of a stream of water passing in the hose pipe from a\r\nfire-engine. The “watt” indicates the sum total unit of electrical power\r\nfor a definite period of time, and in the hose pipe would be\r\nrepresented by the effective force of a definite volume of water,\r\npassing at a definite pressure, during a definite period of time. “Volt”\r\nis a pressure unit of electro-motive force, and would be represented by\r\nthe power of the engine. “Ampere” would be the quantity, or volume unit,\r\nor cross section of the hose pipe, and the “ohm” would be the unit of\r\nfrictional resistance. The “watt” then would be the “volt” multiplied by\r\nthe “ampere”; thus 500 watts would be 10 amperes at 50 volts, or 50\r\namperes at 10 volts. Low tension circuits, such as are used for\r\nincandescent lights, range from 100 to 240 volts and are harmless.\r\nTrolley circuits are usually 500 volts, and will kill an animal, but are\r\nnot necessarily fatal to man. High tension currents from 2,000 to 5,000\r\nvolts, such as are used for arc lights, are fatal.\r\n\r\nOf all modern inventions, not one has advertised itself in such a\r\nspectacular way as the electric light. Those who have seen the\r\nmagnificent electrical displays at the Chicago Fair, the electrical\r\ncelebrations in New York, and the Omaha Exhibition, need no introduction\r\nto its marvelous splendors and beauties. In the annual report for 1898\r\nof the Edison Electric Illuminating Company of New York, its statement\r\nshows that for that city alone the gross earnings were $2,898,021. There\r\nwere 9,990 users of the electric light, 443,074 incandescent lamps, and\r\n7,353 arc lights. It is estimated that the electric light stations and\r\nplants in the United States alone amount to $600,000,000. In the year\r\n1899 a single manufacturing concern (The General Electric Company)\r\nreceived orders for 10,000,000 incandescent lamps, which is about\r\none-half of the present annual production. Sixteen years ago the lamps\r\nwere $1 each; to-day they can be bought for 18 cents.\r\n\r\nWhat the future has in store for the further development of the electric\r\nlight no one may dare predict. Already a different form or manifestation\r\nof electric light has been demonstrated, in which neither the electric\r\narc nor the incandescent filament is used, but a peculiar glow is seen\r\ndisassociated from a direct material habitation, and produced by\r\ncurrents of enormous frequency and high potential, in accordance with\r\nthe patent to Tesla, No. 454,622, June 23, 1891. Other worthy inventors\r\nin this field are at work, and its development will be one of the\r\ninteresting problems of the Twentieth Century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE TELEPHONE.\r\n\r\n    PRELIMINARY SUGGESTIONS AND EXPERIMENTS OF BOURSEUL, REIS AND\r\n    DRAWBAUGH--FIRST SPEAKING TELEPHONE BY PROF. BELL--DIFFERENCES\r\n    BETWEEN REIS’ AND BELL’S TELEPHONES--THE BLAKE TRANSMITTER--\r\n    BERLINER’S VARIATION OF RESISTANCE, AND ELECTRIC UNDULATIONS BY\r\n    VARIATION OF PRESSURE--EDISON’S CARBON MICROPHONE--THE TELEPHONE\r\n    EXCHANGE--STATISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nΤηλε (far), and φωνη (sound), are the Greek roots from which the word\r\ntelephone is derived. It has the significance of transmitting sound to\r\ndistant points, and is a word antedating the present speaking telephone,\r\nalthough this fact is generally lost sight of in the dazzling brilliancy\r\nof this latter invention. In the effort to hear better, the American\r\nIndian was accustomed to place his ear to the ground. Children of former\r\ngenerations also made use of a toy known as the “lovers’ telegraph”--a\r\npiece of string held under tension between the flexible bottoms of two\r\ntin boxes--which latter when spoken into transmitted through the string\r\nthe vibrations from one box to the other, and made audible words spoken\r\nat a distance. These expedients simply made available the superior\r\nconductivity of the solid body over the air to transmit sound waves. The\r\nelectro-magnetic telephone operates on an entirely different principle.\r\nIt is a marvelous creation of genius, and stands alone as the unique,\r\nsuperb, and unapproachable triumph of the Nineteenth Century. For\r\nsubtilty of principle, impressiveness of action, and breadth of results,\r\nthere is nothing comparable with it among mechanical agencies. In its\r\nwonderful function of placing one intelligent being in direct vocal and\r\nsympathetic communication with another a thousand miles away, its\r\nintangible and mysterious mode of action suggests to the imagination\r\nthat unseen medium of prayer rising from the conscious human heart to\r\nits omniscient and responsive God. The telegraph and railroad had\r\nalready brought all the peoples of the earth into intimate communication\r\nand made them close kin, but the telephone transformed them into the\r\ncloser relationship of families, and the tiny wire, sentient and\r\nresponsive with its unlimited burden of human thoughts and human\r\nfeelings, forms one of the great vital cords in the solidarity of the\r\nhuman family.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that many, and perhaps most, great inventions have\r\nbeen in the nature of accidental discoveries, the by-products of thought\r\ndirected in another channel, and seeking other results, but the\r\ntelephone does not belong to this class. It is the logical and\r\nmagnificent outcome of persistent thought and experiment in the\r\ndirection of the electrical transmittal of speech. Prof. Bell had his\r\nobjective point, and keeping this steadily in view, worked faithfully\r\nfor the accomplishment of his object in producing a speaking telephone,\r\nuntil success crowned his work. He probably did not realize at first the\r\nfull magnitude of the achievement, but looking at it from the end of the\r\nNineteenth Century, he might well exclaim in the language of Horace:\r\n“_Exegi monumentum acre perennius_.”\r\n\r\nProf. Bell’s conception of the telephone dates back as far as 1874. His\r\nfirst United States patent, No. 174,465, was granted March 7, 1876, and\r\nhis second January 30, 1877, No. 186,787. It is generally the fate of\r\nmost inventions, even of a meritorious order, to languish for many\r\nyears, and frequently through the whole term of the patent, before\r\nreceiving full recognition and adoption by the public, but the meteoric\r\nbrilliancy of this invention at its first public announcement astonished\r\nthe masses, and inspired the admiration of the savants of the world.\r\nWhen exhibited at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, in 1876, it\r\nwas spoken of by Sir William Thomson, and Prof. Henry, as the “greatest\r\nby far of all the marvels of the electric telegraph.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--PHILIP REIS’ TELEPHONE.]\r\n\r\nIt is always the fate of the author of any great invention to be\r\ncompelled to defend himself against the claims of others. It is one of\r\nthe failings of human nature to lay claim to that which somebody else\r\nhas obtained, and is an old story which finds its first illustration in\r\nthe squabbles of childhood. When a troop of prattling boys hunt\r\nbutterflies among the daisies, and some sharp-eyed youngster has\r\ncaptured a prize, there are always others of his mates to cry, “I saw it\r\nfirst,” and men are but grown-up boys. So in the history of the\r\ntelephone, Prof. Bell has found competitors for this honor, and it is\r\nastonishing to know how close some of these prior experimenters came to\r\nsuccess without reaching it. In 1854 Bourseul, of Paris _suggested_ an\r\nelectric telephone, and in 1861 Philip Reis _devised_ an electric\r\ntelephone which would transmit musical tones. Daniel Drawbaugh, of\r\nPennsylvania, is alleged to have made an electric telephone in\r\n1867-1868, and his claims against the Bell interests were fought\r\nvigorously in the Patent Office, and in the courts, but without success.\r\nElisha Gray’s claims perhaps came nearer to establishing for him a share\r\nin the honor of inventing the speaking telephone than any other, for he\r\nfiled a caveat in the United States Patent Office upon the same day\r\n(February 14, 1876), upon which Prof. Bell’s application for a patent\r\nwas made. But in the contest in the Patent Office with Gray, Edison,\r\nBerliner, Richmond, Holcombe, Farmer, Dolbear, Volker, and others, it\r\nwas decided that Prof. Bell was the first to make a practically\r\neffective speaking telephone, and this conclusion has been sustained by\r\nthe courts. Reis was a poor German school teacher at Friedrichsdorf, and\r\nin 1860 he took a coil of wire, a knitting needle, the skin of a German\r\nsausage, the bung of a beer barrel, and a strip of platinum, and\r\nconstructed the first electric telephone. A typical form of his\r\ntransmitter, see Fig. 55, was a box covered with a vibrating membrane E,\r\nand provided with a mouth-piece at one side. A platinum strip F was\r\nattached to the membrane or vibrating diaphragm E, and a platinum\r\npointed hammer G rested lightly on the platinum strip F. The hammer G\r\nand platinum strip F were connected to the opposite ends of a wire,\r\nwhich had in its circuit a battery and a receiver. Air vibrations in the\r\nnature of sound waves in the box caused the diaphragm E to vibrate, and\r\na separating make-and-break contact between the platinum strip F and the\r\nplatinum point of hammer G caused a series of separate and distinct\r\nbroken impulses to traverse the battery circuit and be received upon the\r\nreceiver, which latter consisted of an iron rod with a coil of wire\r\naround it. That Reis’ transmitter did alternately make and break the\r\ncircuit, seems clear from his own memoir. A translation from this\r\nmemoir, taken from the annual report (Jahresberichte) of the Physical\r\nSociety of Frankfurt am Main for 1860-1861, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n“At the first condensation (of air vibrations) the hammer-shaped little\r\nwire _d_ (G in our illustration), will be pushed back. At the succeeding\r\nrarefaction it cannot follow the return vibration of the membrane, and\r\nthe current going through the little strip (of platinum) remains\r\ninterrupted so long as until the membrane driven by a new condensation\r\npresses the little strip against _d_ (the hammer G) once more. In this\r\nway each sound wave effects an opening and closing of the current.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--PROF. BELL’S TELEPHONE, MARCH 7, 1876.]\r\n\r\nReis evidently did not know how to make the vibrations of his diaphragm\r\ntranslate themselves into exactly commensurate and correlated electric\r\nimpulses of equal rapidity, range, and quality. If he had done this, he\r\nwould have had a speaking telephone, but a make-and-break contact could\r\nnever do it, and hence he in his later instruments attached to them a\r\ntelegraphic key in order that the sending operator might communicate\r\nwith the receiving operator. If Reis’ telephone had been a speaking\r\ntelephone, this would have been unnecessary. Furthermore, it is\r\ninconceivable how the intelligent, progressive, and scientific Germans\r\ncould have failed to have given to a speaking telephone in 1860 the\r\nimmediate honor and attention that it deserved. In America, the Bell\r\nspeaking telephone, invented in 1876, was known all over the civilized\r\nworld the same year. Reis’ broken contact circuit would transmit musical\r\ntones, because musical tones vary chiefly in rapidity of vibration,\r\nrather than in range, or quality, and the chattering contacts of Reis’\r\ntelephone would transmit musical tones because said contracts could be\r\nadjusted to the practically uniform range of vibration. Prof. Bell,\r\nhowever, had made a special study of articulate speech, and knew that\r\nspeech was not essentially musical, but was composed of an irregular and\r\ndiscordant medley of vowel and consonant sounds, whose vibrations varied\r\nnot only in pitch or rapidity like musical tones, but also in the\r\nquality or kind of vibrations as to range and loudness. In his\r\ninvention, therefore, he did not make and break the circuit as did Reis,\r\nthrough the contact points, but he used the more sensitive plan of a\r\nconstantly closed circuit, and merely caused the current to undulate in\r\nit by a principle of magnetic induction. This principle was first\r\ndiscovered by Oersted, and developed into the well known fact that when\r\na piece of iron is moved back and forth from the poles of an\r\nelectro-magnet an induced current is made to oscillate in the helix of\r\nthe electro-magnet. The difference between Reis’ separating\r\nmake-and-break circuit, and the Bell continuous but undulating current,\r\nmight be illustrated by the difference between the impulses delivered by\r\nthe beating of the drum sticks on the head of a drum, on the one hand,\r\nand the alternate pulling and slackening of a kite cord, on the other.\r\nIn the successive impacts on the head of a drum there could not be so\r\nsensitive a transfer of motion to the lower head of the drum as there\r\nwould be transferred to the kite by the movement of the hand holding the\r\nkite cord. Reis’ plan resembled the broken drum beats, and Bell’s the\r\nkite cord, which always preserved a certain amount of tension. Bell\r\naccomplished his object by the means shown in Figs. 56 and 57, in which\r\nFig. 56 represents his first patent of March 7, 1876, and Fig. 57 his\r\nsecond patent of January 30, 1877. In both cases the current was a\r\ncontinuously closed one, and was not alternately made and broken as by\r\nthe separating contacts of Reis. Prof. Bell caused the vocal air\r\nvibrations to undulate or oscillate the continuously closed circuit by\r\nthe principle of magnetic induction as follows (see Fig. 56): He caused\r\ndiaphragm _a_, when spoken against, to vibrate the armature _c_ in front\r\nof the electro-magnet _b_, but without touching it, and as the armature\r\napproached and receded from the electro-magnet it induced an undulating\r\nbut never broken current in the helix of this electro-magnet and along\r\nthe line to and through the helix of the electro-magnet _f_ at the\r\ndistant receiver, and this undulating current, influencing the armature\r\n_h_, which touched the diaphragm _i_ but not the electro-magnet,\r\nproduced in the attractive influence of the magnet on this armature and\r\ndiaphragm, vibrations of the same rapidity, range, and quality as those\r\nvocal vibrations that acted upon the first diaphragm _a_. In other\r\nwords, the sequence of transference was air vibrations in A, mechanical\r\nvibrations of diaphragm _a_, electrical undulations traversing the line,\r\ninduced vibrations in armature _h_ and diaphragm _i_, and air vibrations\r\nagain resolved back into sounds of articulate speech, the same as those\r\nspoken into A. It will be perceived that in the Bell telephone both\r\ntransmitter and receiver were of identical construction. This is better\r\nshown in Fig. 57 of his later patent, in which the horizontal line below\r\nthe electro-magnet on one side represents a metal transmitting\r\ndiaphragm, and the horizontal line under the electro-magnet at the other\r\nside was the receiving diaphragm. Not only were the sounds thus\r\nreproduced, but as the circuit was continuous and never broken by any\r\nseparating contacts, the extreme sensitiveness of the electric\r\nvibrations set up by magnetic induction was such that the discordant and\r\nirregular quality of the vibrations of articulate speech were\r\ntransferred and reproduced with exact fidelity, as well as the musical\r\ntones, and this rendered the speaking telephone a success. In later\r\ntelephones the current is actually transmitted through the contacting\r\npoints, but this only became practicable after the carbon microphone\r\ntransmitter was invented, in which the essential undulations of the\r\nelectric current were produced in another way, _i. e._, by the\r\napplication of the important discovery that the varying of the pressure\r\non carbon, by vibration, varied its conductivity, and in this way\r\nproduced the same result of undulating a current without breaking it.\r\nThis in no wise detracts from the value of the principle of the\r\ncontinuous undulating current discovered and employed by Prof. Bell,\r\nbetween which and the breaks of the hard platinum points of Reis there\r\nis a difference as wide as the difference between success and failure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--PROF. BELL’S TELEPHONE, JANUARY 30, 1877.]\r\n\r\nThe form in which Prof. Bell’s telephone was placed before the public\r\nwas not that shown in the patents, but it quickly assumed the well-known\r\nshape of an elongated cylinder forming a handle, with a flaring\r\nmouth-piece at one end. This development in form is credited to Dr.\r\nChanning in 1877, and it is the familiar form to-day, whose internal\r\nconstruction is shown in Fig. 58. The handle is made of hard rubber, and\r\nthe cap or mouth-piece, which is screwed thereon, is also of hard\r\nrubber. The diaphragm A, of thin ferrotype plate, is clamped at its\r\nedges between the cap, or mouth-piece, and the handle. The compound\r\nmagnet B is composed of four thin flat bar magnets, arranged in pairs on\r\nopposite sides of the flat end of the soft iron pole piece _c_ at one\r\nend, and the soft iron spacing piece _d_ at the other end, the magnets\r\nbeing clamped to these pieces with like poles all in one direction. The\r\nend of the pole piece _c_ extends to within 1/100 to 2/100 of an inch of\r\nthe diaphragm, or as near as possible so that the diaphragm does not\r\ntouch it when it vibrates. On the pole piece _c_ is placed a wooden\r\nspool on which is wound silk-covered wire (No. 34, Am. W. G.). This wire\r\nfills the spool, and its ends are soldered to two insulated wires which\r\npass through a flexible rubber disc _f_ below the spool and extend\r\nrespectively to the two binding posts at the opposite end of the handle.\r\nThe current passes from one binding post and its connecting wire,\r\nthrough the wire on the spool, and thence to the other connecting wire\r\nand binding post. When used as a transmitter, vocal vibrations acting\r\nmechanically on the diaphragm A produce undulatory vibrations by\r\nmagnetic induction in the spool of wire, which are transmitted to the\r\nother end of the line; and when used as a receiver, the undulatory\r\nvibrations from the remote end of the line produce mechanical vibrations\r\nin the diaphragm, which set up air vibrations that are reproductions of\r\narticulate sounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--LONGITUDINAL SECTION OF BELL TELEPHONE.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Bell telephone is both a transmitter and receiver, in\r\npractice a more sensitive and better form of transmitter has taken its\r\nplace. That most generally used and best known is the “Blake\r\ntransmitter,” which was brought out about 1880. This employs two\r\nimportant elements. The first is the carbon microphone, which is a means\r\nfor producing the undulations in the current by the variations in\r\npressure on carbon contacts, and the second is an induction coil\r\noperated by a local battery, whose primary circuit passes through the\r\ncontacts of the carbon microphone, and whose secondary circuit passes\r\nover the line. These fundamental elements of the Blake transmitter were\r\nthe inventions of Berliner and Edison, and were made in 1877. The broad\r\nidea of producing electric undulations by varying the pressure between\r\nelectrodes by vocal vibrations, was a large bone of contention in the\r\nPatent Office between various inventors. An application for a patent for\r\nthe same was filed in the Patent Office by Emile Berliner, June 4, 1877,\r\nwhich was contested in an interference by Gray, Edison, Richmond,\r\nDolbear, Holcombe, Prof. Bell, and others. After fourteen years of\r\nlitigation the patent was finally awarded to Berliner. The patent\r\ngranted to him November 17, 1891, No. 463,569, is a valuable one, and\r\nhas become the property of the American Bell Telephone Company. The\r\napplication of a low resistance conductor (carbon) in a microphone was\r\ninvented by Edison as early as 1877, but his patent, No. 474,230, did\r\nnot issue until May 3, 1892, on account of the interference with\r\nBerliner on the broader principle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--BLAKE TRANSMITTER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--DIAGRAM OF CIRCUITS IN BLAKE TRANSMITTER.]\r\n\r\nThe Blake transmitter takes its name from the inventor of its mechanical\r\nfeatures, who has assembled in it the fundamental principles of Berliner\r\nand Edison in a sensitive and practical mechanical construction, covered\r\nby minor patents, dated November 29, 1881. It is the little box in the\r\nmiddle of the familiar telephone outfit into which the talking is done.\r\nIts internal construction is shown in Fig. 59. To the rear of the door\r\nis secured the cast iron circular ring A, inside of which lies the\r\nRussia iron diaphragm B, cushioned at its edges with a rubber band. A\r\ncircular seat a little larger than the diaphragm is formed in the iron\r\nring, and on this seat the diaphragm rests. A short, thin metal plate\r\nattached to the ring A on the right hand side clamps the diaphragm in\r\nposition by resting squarely on the rubber edge of the diaphragm. Its\r\nfunction is like that of a hinge, which allows the diaphragm to freely\r\nswing inward. A steel damping spring is secured to the ring at the\r\nopposite edge of the diaphragm, and has its free end provided with a\r\nrubber glove on which is cemented a thin piece of fluffy woolen\r\nmaterial. The padded end of the damping spring rests against the\r\ndiaphragm and prevents excessive vibration. The iron ring A has at its\r\nbottom a projection holding an adjusting screw, and to a similar top\r\nprojection is attached by screws a brass spring, from which depends\r\nanother casting C, supporting the microphone apparatus, which is best\r\nshown in the diagram, Fig. 60. In this diagram A is one terminal of the\r\nbattery connected by wire S to the hinge H of the box. From the other\r\nleaf of the hinge the wire M passes to K, where it is soldered to the\r\nupper end of a German silver spring I. At K this spring is clamped and\r\ninsulated from the iron work by two pieces of hard rubber. On the lower\r\nend of the spring I is soldered a short piece of thick platinum wire,\r\nwhose ends are rounded into heads, one of which bears against the\r\ndiaphragm N, and the other against the carbon button J. This button is\r\nattached to a small brass weight, and is supported by a spring R,\r\nclamped at its upper end to the metal support T. This spring is\r\nsurrounded its entire length by rubber tubing to deaden vibration. The\r\ntransmitter is adjusted by screw O, which, acting upon casting T, brings\r\nthe carbon button, the platinum heads, and also the diaphragm N, against\r\neach other with a regulated pressure. The current passes from the part K\r\nto the spring I, the platinum head, carbon button J, and its supporting\r\nspring R, to metal casting T, and ring V, thence by wire L to the lower\r\nhinge G, by wire P to the primary of the induction coil, and thence by\r\nwire Y to binding post B, the two binding posts A B being the two\r\nbattery terminals. The secondary wire E of the induction coil has its\r\nends connected by wires X and W with the two binding posts C B, which\r\nare the line terminals, or one the line terminal and the other the\r\nground connection. It will thus be seen that the primary current passes\r\nthrough the transmitter, and the secondary traverses the line. The most\r\nfamiliar forms of the telephone are those seen in Figs. 61 and 62, but\r\nthe ideal form is rigged in a cabinet or little room, which excludes all\r\nextraneous interfering sounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--WALL TELEPHONE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--DESK TELEPHONE.]\r\n\r\nWith the Bell receiver and the Blake transmitter a good practical\r\ntelephone system may be constructed, but the improvements which have\r\nbeen made in the short life of the telephone are beyond adequate\r\ndescription, or even mention. They relate to the call bell, the battery,\r\nthe switchboard, meters for registering calls, conductors, conduits,\r\nconnections, lightning arresters, switches, anti-induction devices,\r\nrepeaters, and systems. Among those most prominently identified with its\r\ndevelopment are Bell, Edison, Berliner, Hughes, Gray, Dolbear and\r\nPhelps. The activity in this field is best illustrated by the fact that\r\nthe art of telephony, begun practically in 1876, has at the end of the\r\nNineteenth Century grown into some 3,000 United States patents on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--TELEPHONE EXCHANGE.]\r\n\r\nThat which has given the telephone its greatest commercial value is the\r\n“exchange” system, by which at a central office any member of a\r\ntelephonic community may be instantly put into communication with any\r\nother member of that community. For this purpose, see Fig. 63, a\r\ncontinuous switchboard is arranged along the side of a large room and\r\noccupies most of that side of the wall. It comprises a great array of\r\nannunciator drops, spring jacks with plug seats, and connecting cords\r\nwith metal plugs at their opposite ends. Each subscriber is connected to\r\nhis own spring jack and annunciator drop, and his call to central\r\noffice (from his magneto-bell) throws down the annunciator drop which\r\nbears the number of his telephone, and announces to the attendant his\r\ndesire to communicate with another. To insure the attention of the\r\nattendant, a tiny electric lamp is by the same action lighted directly\r\nin front of her, which acts as a pilot signal to call her attention to\r\nthe drop. The attendant now puts a plug in that spring jack, which\r\nautomatically restores the drop, and she then asks the number which the\r\nsubscriber wants, and, upon ascertaining this, puts the plug at the\r\nother end of the connecting cord into the spring jack of the subscriber\r\nwanted, and by this action disconnects her own telephone. As every\r\ntelephone subscriber has in the central office an apparatus exclusively\r\nhis own, it will be seen that a telephone community of several thousands\r\nof subscribers involves an imposing array of multiple connections, and a\r\ngreat expense in construction. Girls are chosen as exchange attendants\r\nbecause their voices are clearer. Every telephone jack, however, does\r\nnot have its Jill, for each girl has charge of a hundred or more jacks,\r\nand wears constantly on her head a telephone of special shape, embracing\r\nher head like a child’s hoop comb, but terminating with an ear-piece at\r\none end that covers one ear. She is too busy to waste time in adjusting\r\nan ordinary telephone to her ear, and so wears one of special design all\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nIn the twentieth annual report of the American Bell Telephone Company,\r\nfor the year 1899, the number of telephones in use January 1, 1900, by\r\nthat company alone, in the United States, was 1,580,101; the miles of\r\nwire were 1,016,777, and the daily connections for persons using the\r\ntelephone were 5,173,803. The gross earnings of the company were\r\n$5,760,106.45, and it paid in dividends $3,882,945. The total number of\r\nexchange stations of the Bell Company in the principal countries of the\r\nworld are: United States, 632,946; Germany, 212,121; Great Britain,\r\n112,840; Sweden, 63,685; France, 44,865; Switzerland, 35,536; Russia,\r\n26,865; Austria, 26,664; Norway, 25,376. The United States has nearly\r\n85,000 more than all the others put together.\r\n\r\nSince the expiration of the Bell patents many smaller companies have\r\nsprung up, and the number of telephones in use has more than doubled in\r\nthe last five years. Long distance telephony is now carried on up to\r\nnearly 2,000 miles, and one may to-day lie in bed in New York and listen\r\nto a concert in Chicago, and the vocal exchange of business and social\r\nintercourse between cities has become so large a feature of modern life\r\nas to justify the organization of a great company for this service\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nIn the Old Testament, Book of Job, xxxviii. chapter, 35th verse, it is\r\nwritten: “Canst thou send lightnings that they may go and say unto\r\nthee--‘Here we are?’” For thousands of years this challenge to Job has\r\nbeen looked upon as a feat whose execution was only within the power of\r\nthe Almighty; but to-day the inventor--that patient modern Job--has\r\naccomplished this seemingly impossible task, for at the end of this\r\nNineteenth Century of the Christian Era, the telephone makes the\r\nlightning man’s vocal messenger, tireless, faithful, and true, knowing\r\nno prevarication, and swifter than the winged messenger of the gods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY--MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\n    STORAGE BATTERY--BATTERIES OF PLANTÉ, FAURE AND BRUSH--ELECTRIC\r\n    WELDING--DIRECT GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY BY COMBUSTION--ELECTRIC\r\n    BOATS--ELECTRO-PLATING--EDISON’S ELECTRIC PEN--ELECTRICITY IN\r\n    MEDICINE--ELECTRIC CAUTERY--ELECTRICAL MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS--ELECTRIC\r\n    BLASTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nA prominent factor in the electrical art is the _Storage Battery_,\r\nSecondary Battery, or Accumulator, as it is variously called. A storage\r\nbattery acts upon the same general principle as the ordinary galvanic or\r\nvoltaic battery in giving forth electrical current as the correlated\r\nequivalent of the chemical force, but differs from it in this respect,\r\nthat when the elements of a primary battery are used up, the battery is\r\nexhausted beyond repair. With the storage battery, it may be regenerated\r\nat will by simply subjecting it to an electric current from a dynamo.\r\nThe dynamo stores up in this battery its electric force by converting it\r\ninto chemical force, which is imprisoned in chemical compounds that are\r\nformed while the power of the dynamo is being applied. These chemical\r\ncompounds are, however, in a condition of unstable chemical equilibrium,\r\nwhich is undisturbed so long as the poles of the storage battery are not\r\nconnected, but when connected through a circuit, the instability of the\r\nchemical compounds asserts itself, and in passing back to a condition of\r\nnormal equilibrium the disruption gives off the correlative equivalent\r\nof electric current stored up in it by the dynamo.\r\n\r\nProbably the earliest suggestion of a storage battery is by Ritter in\r\n1812, in his “secondary pile.” This device consisted of alternate discs\r\nof copper and moistened card, and was capable of receiving a charge from\r\na voltaic pile and of then producing the physical, chemical, and\r\nphysiological effects obtained from the ordinary pile. The first storage\r\nbattery of importance, however, was made by Gaston Planté in 1860, which\r\nconsisted of leaden plates immersed in a 10 per cent. solution of\r\nsulphuric acid in water. In Fig. 64 is shown a modification of the\r\nPlanté type of storage battery, composed of a series of plates shown on\r\nthe left. Each of these plates is built up, as shown in detail in Fig.\r\n65, of lead strips corrugated and arranged in layers alternately with\r\nflat strips, within perforated leaden cases. The corrugation of the\r\nleaden laminæ gives greater superficial area, and the alternation of\r\nflat and corrugated strips keeps them properly spaced, so the sulphuric\r\nacid solution may penetrate and act upon the same. Each plate section\r\nhas a rod to connect it with its proper terminal. When the charging\r\ncurrent is applied, the positive lead plate becomes covered with lead\r\nperoxide (PbO₂) and finely divided metallic lead is deposited on the\r\nnegative plate. When the battery is being discharged the peroxide of\r\nlead gives up one of its atoms of oxygen to the spongy metallic lead\r\ndeposited on the other plate, and both plates remain coated with lead\r\nmonoxide (PbO).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--PLANTÉ STORAGE BATTERY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--ENLARGED DETAIL OF PLANTÉ PLATE.]\r\n\r\nThe most important development of the storage battery was made by\r\nCamille A. Faure, in 1880 (U. S. Pat. No. 252,002, Jan 3, 1882). In the\r\nearly part of 1881 there was sent from Paris to Glasgow a so-called “box\r\nof electric energy” for inspection and test by Sir William Thomson, the\r\neminent electrician. It was one of the first storage batteries of M.\r\nFaure. The illustration, Fig. 66, shows a battery of this type in which\r\nthe lead plates covered with red lead (Pb₃O₄) replace the plain lead\r\nplates in the Planté cell. The action of the battery is that when a\r\ncurrent of electricity is passed into the same, the red lead on one\r\nplate (the negative) is reduced to metallic lead, and that on the other\r\nis oxidized to a state of peroxide (PbO₂). These actions are reversed\r\nwhen the charged cell is discharging itself. The elements of this\r\nbattery consist of alternate layers of sheet lead, and a paste of red\r\noxide of lead. These are immersed in a 10 per cent. solution of\r\nsulphuric acid in water. Many minor improvements have been made in the\r\nstorage battery, covered by 716 United States patents, most of which\r\nrelate to cellular construction for holding the mass of red lead in\r\nplace. The most notable are those of Brush, to whom many patents were\r\ngranted in 1882 and 1883.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--STORAGE BATTERY--FAURE TYPE.]\r\n\r\nThe storage battery finds many important applications. For furnishing\r\ncurrent for the propulsion of electric street cars it has proved a\r\ndisappointment, on account of the vibrations to which it is subjected,\r\nand the great weight of the lead, which in batteries of suitable\r\ncapacity runs up into many thousands of pounds. The storage battery\r\nfinds a useful place, however, for equalizing the load in lighting and\r\npower stations, and is there brought into action to supplement the\r\nengine and dynamo during those hours of the day when the tax or load is\r\ngreatest. It is also used to keep up electrical pressure at the ends of\r\nlong transmission lines; for telegraphing purposes; for isolated\r\nelectric lighting; for boat propulsion; the propulsion of automobile\r\ncarriages; and in all cases where a portable source of electric current\r\nwould find application. The great growth of automobile carriages in the\r\npast year has greatly stimulated the output of storage batteries. One\r\nlarge company (The Electric Storage Battery Company), manufactured and\r\nsold storage batteries for the year ending June 1, 1899, to the amount\r\nof $2,387,049.91, and there are many other manufacturers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--ELECTRIC WELDING.]\r\n\r\n_Electric Welding_ was invented by Prof. Elihu Thomson, of Lynn, Mass.,\r\nand patented by him August 10, 1886, No. 347,140-42, and July 18, 1893,\r\nNo. 501,546. It is useful for the making of chains, tools, carriage\r\naxles, joining shafting, wires, and pipes, mending bands, tires, hoops,\r\nand lengthening and shortening bolts, bars, etc. For electric welding a\r\ncurrent of great volume or quantity, and very low electro-motive force,\r\nis required. Thus a current of from one to two volts, and one to several\r\nthousand amperes, is best suited. Referring to Fig. 67, the current from\r\nthe dynamo is conducted to one binding post of the commutator 3, which\r\nis arranged to send the current through one-sixth, one-third or one-half\r\nof the primary wire P of a transformer or induction coil. The other\r\nbinding post of the commutator 3 extends to one terminal of an isolated\r\nprimary coil 4, and the other terminal of this coil connects with the\r\ndynamo. The coil 4 is provided with a switch to regulate the amount of\r\ncurrent. The rods to be welded are placed in clamps C C′, C being\r\nconnected with one terminal of the secondary conductor S, and the\r\nmovable clamp C′ with the other. When the current is turned on C′ is\r\nmoved so as to project one of the surfaces to be welded against the\r\nother, and as they come in contact they heat and fuse together, as shown\r\nat W. Larger apparatus has been devised to weld railroad joints on the\r\nroadbed, and for other applications.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY BY COMBUSTION.]\r\n\r\n_The generation of electricity_ for commercial purposes is almost\r\nentirely dependent upon the dynamo, as this is cheaper than the voltaic\r\nbattery. The dynamo, however, must be energized by a steam engine. The\r\ndirect production of electric energy by the combustion of coal would be\r\nthe ideal method. A process invented by Edison (Pat. No. 490,953, Jan.\r\n31, 1893), is interesting as an effort in this direction, and is\r\npresented in Fig. 68. A carbon cylinder D is suspended in an air-tight\r\nvessel B, and is surrounded by oxide of iron F, the whole being placed\r\nabove a furnace. The temperature being raised to a point where the\r\ncarbon will be attacked by the oxygen, carbonic oxide and carbonic acid\r\nwill be formed, which are exhausted by the suction fan E. A constant\r\ncurrent of electricity is given off from the two electrodes through the\r\nwires, the metallic oxide being reduced and the carbon consumed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--RUDDER AND MOTOR OF TROUVÉ’S ELECTRIC BOAT,\r\n1881.]\r\n\r\n_Electrical Navigation_ began with Jacobi, who made the first attempt on\r\nthe Neva in 1839. He used voltaic apparatus consisting of two Grove\r\nbatteries, each containing sixty-four pairs of cells, but little\r\nprogress was made in this field until the secondary battery was\r\nperfected. In 1881 Mr. G. Trouvé made an application of the storage\r\nbattery and electric motor to a small boat on the Seine. The electric\r\nmotor, which was located on top of the rudder, as seen in Fig. 69, was\r\nfurnished with a Siemens armature connected by an endless belt with a\r\nscrew propeller having three paddles arranged in the middle of an iron\r\nrudder. In the middle of the boat were two storage batteries connected\r\nwith the motor by two cords that both served to cover the conducting\r\nwires and work the rudder. Electric launches have in later years rapidly\r\ngained in popularity. Visitors to the Chicago fair will remember the\r\nfleet of electric launches, which afforded both pleasure and\r\ntransportation on the water, at that great exposition, and to-day every\r\nsafe harbor has its quota of these silently gliding and fascinating\r\npleasure crafts. Fig. 70 is a longitudinal section and a general view of\r\none of these launches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--MODERN ELECTRIC LAUNCH.]\r\n\r\n_Electro-plating_ is one of the great industrial applications of\r\nelectricity which had its origin in, and has grown into extensive use\r\nin, the Nineteenth Century. It originated with Volta, Cruikshank, and\r\nWollaston in the very first year of the century. In 1805 Brugnatelli, a\r\npupil of Volta, gilded two large silver medals by bringing them into\r\ncommunication by means of a steel wire with the negative pole of a\r\nvoltaic pile and keeping them one after the other immersed in a solution\r\nof gold. In 1834 Henry Bessemer electro-plated lead castings with copper\r\nin the production of antique relief heads. In 1838 Prof. Jacobi\r\nannounced his galvano-plastic process for the production of electrotype\r\nplates for printing. In the same year he superintended the gilding, by\r\nelectro-plate, of the iron dome of the Cathedral of St. Isaac at St.\r\nPetersburgh, using 274 pounds of ducat gold. In 1839 Spencer described\r\nan electrotype process and carried the date of his operations back to\r\nSeptember, 1837. In 1839 Jordan also describes an electro-plating\r\nprocess. In 1840 Murray used plumbago to make non-conducting surfaces\r\nconductive for electro-plating. In 1840 De Le Rive made known his\r\nprocess of electro-gilding, employed by him in 1828, and in the same\r\nyear (1840) De Ruolz took out a French patent for electro-gilding, and\r\nin the following year formed electro deposits of brass from cyanides of\r\nzinc and copper. In 1841 Smee employed his battery for electro-plating\r\nwith various metals. In 1844 there were published the electro-plating\r\nexperiments of Dancer, made in 1838. In 1847 Prof. Silliman imitated\r\nmother-of-pearl by electro-plating process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--ELECTRO-PLATING ESTABLISHMENT.]\r\n\r\nIn the last half of the century the production of electrotype plates for\r\nprinting in books, and for the production of rollers for printing\r\nfabrics, and the extensive art of electro-plating with gold, silver,\r\nnickel and copper, has grown to enormous proportions, but the\r\nfundamental principles have not materially changed. The dynamo, however,\r\nhas generally supplanted the voltaic battery in this art. The deposition\r\nof silver and gold on baser metals not only increases the ornamental\r\neffect, but prevents oxidation. Silver plated goods for the table and\r\narticles of vertu are to be found everywhere. Nickel is employed for\r\ncheaper ornamental effect, and copper finds a large application for\r\nelectrotypes for printing and for coating iron castings as a protection\r\nagainst rust. In Fig. 71, which shows the interior of an electro-plating\r\nestablishment, the dynamo is shown on the right connected by wires with\r\ntwo horizontal rods running along the wall and across the various tanks\r\ncontaining the plating solution. On the tanks are rods supporting the\r\narticles to be plated, which are suspended in the solution. Similar rods\r\nsupport the opposite electrodes of the tank. Wires connect these rods to\r\nthe rods on the side of the wall, and to the opposite poles of the\r\ndynamo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--EDISON’S ELECTRIC PEN.]\r\n\r\n_The electric pen of Edison_, brought out in 1876 (U. S. Pat. No.\r\n196,747, Nov. 6, 1877), is one of the simple applications of\r\nelectricity, which for a number of years was in quite general use for\r\nmaking manifold copies of manuscript. In the illustration, Fig. 72, this\r\nis shown. It comprises a stylus _b_ reciprocated in a tube _a_ by the\r\nvibratory action of an armature _k_ over the poles of an electro-magnet,\r\nsupplied with a suitable current and vibrating contacts _l h_. The\r\nstylus was rapidly reciprocated, and as the operator traced the letters\r\non the paper, the stylus produced a continuous trail of punctures which\r\npermitted the paper to be used as a stencil to make any number of\r\ncopies. It has, however, been rotated out of existence by manifolding\r\ncarbon paper, and the almost universal use of the typewriter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--ELECTRIC CAUTERY.]\r\n\r\n_Electricity in Medicine._--The superstitious mind is prone to resort to\r\nmysterious agencies for the cure of diseases, and for many years men of\r\nno scientific knowledge whatever have been employing this seductive\r\ninstrumentality for all the ills that flesh is heir to. That it has\r\nvaluable therapeutic qualities when rightly applied no intelligent\r\nperson will doubt, and it is unfortunate that for the most part it has\r\nbeen in the hands of charlatans who sell their wares, and rely upon a\r\nfaith-cure principle for the result. Still there have been intelligent\r\nexperimenters in this field, and it is one of much promise for further\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nIn the first century of the Christian Era (A. D. 50) Scribonius Largus\r\nrelates that Athero, a freedman of Tiberius, was cured of the gout by\r\nthe shocks of the torpedo or electric eel. In 1803 M. Carpue published\r\nexperiments on the therapeutic action of electricity. The discovery of\r\ninduction currents by Faraday in 1831 brought a new era in the medical\r\napplication of electricity, in the use of what is known as the Faradaic\r\ncurrent. The first apparatus for medical use, which operated on this\r\nprinciple, was made by M. Pixii in France, and the first physician who\r\nemployed such currents was Dr. Neef, of Frankfort. The medical battery\r\nis a well-known and useful adjunct to the physician’s outfit. Electric\r\nbaths are also common and effective modes of applying the electric\r\ncurrent. An early example of such a device is shown in the U. S. patent\r\nto Young, No. 32,332, May 14, 1861. The electric cautery and probe are\r\nalso scientific and useful instruments. The cautery consists of a loop\r\nof platinum wire carried by a suitable non-conducting handle, with means\r\nfor constricting the white hot loop of wire about the tumor or object to\r\nbe excised. It was invented in 1846 by Crusell, of St. Petersburgh. A\r\nform of the electric cautery is shown in Fig. 73, in which _a_ is the\r\nplatinum wire loop whose branches slide through guide tubes, the ends\r\nbeing attached to a sliding ring B. The current enters through the wire\r\nat the binding posts at the end of non-conducting handle A, and heats\r\nthe platinum loop, _a_, red hot. The loop, _a_, being around the object\r\nto be excised, is constricted by drawing down the handle ring B.\r\n\r\nOf the various applications of electricity in body wear and appliances\r\nthere is scarcely any end. There are patents for belts without number,\r\nfor electric gloves, rings, bracelets, necklaces, trusses, corsets,\r\nshoes, hats, combs, brushes, chairs, couches, and blankets. Patents have\r\nalso been granted for electric smelling bottles, an adhesive plaster,\r\nfor electric spectacles, scissors, a foot warmer, hair singer, syringes,\r\na drinking cup, a hair cutter, a torch, a catheter, a pessary, gas\r\nlighters, exercising devices, a door mat, and even for an electric hair\r\npin and a pair of electric garters.\r\n\r\n_Electrical Musical Instruments_ include pianos, banjos, and violins,\r\nall of which are to be played automatically by the aid of electrical\r\nappliances. In the illustration, Fig. 74, is shown a modern electrical\r\npiano. A small electrical motor 1, run by a storage battery or electric\r\nlight wires, turns a belt 3, and rotates pulley 4 and a long horizontal\r\ncylinder 5 running beneath the keyboard. Above this cylinder is the\r\nmechanism that acts upon the keys. It consists of a series of brake\r\nshoes which, when brought into frictional contact with the cylinder 5,\r\nare made to act on small vertical rods which bring down the keys just as\r\nthe fingers do in playing. The selection of the proper keys is made by a\r\ntraveling strip of paper perforated with dots and dashes representing\r\nthe notes, which strip of paper passes between two metal contact faces,\r\nwhich are terminals of an electric battery. When the contacts are\r\nseparated by the non-conducting paper the current does not flow, but\r\nwhen the contacts come together through the perforations the current is\r\ncompleted through an electro-magnet, and this is made to bring the\r\nproper brake shoe into position to be lifted by the cylinder 5, which\r\nrotates constantly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--ELECTRIC PIANO.]\r\n\r\n_Electro-blasting._--In 1812 Schilling proposed to blow up mines by the\r\ngalvanic current. In 1839 Colonel Pasley blew up the wreck of the “Royal\r\nGeorge” by electro-blasting. On Jan. 26, 1843, Mr. Cubitt used\r\nelectro-blasting to destroy Round Down Cliff, and in our own time the\r\nextensive excavations in deepening the channel and removing the rocks at\r\nHell Gate, from the mouth of New York harbor, was a notable operation in\r\nelectro-blasting, and doubtless owes its success largely to the electric\r\ncurrent employed.\r\n\r\nOnly the briefest mention can be made of the induction coil and the\r\nelectrical transformer, of electric bells and hotel annunciators, of\r\nelectric railway signalling, and electric brakes, of electric clocks and\r\ninstruments of precision, of heating by electricity, of electrical\r\nhorticulture, and of the beautiful electric fountains. These, however,\r\nall belong to the Nineteenth Century, and include interesting\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\n_Electro-chemistry_ and the _electrolytic refining of metals_ represent\r\nalso, in the applications of electricity, a large and important field,\r\nmore fully treated under the chapters devoted to chemistry and metal\r\nworking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE STEAM ENGINE.\r\n\r\n    HERO’S ENGINE, AND OTHER EARLY STEAM ENGINES--WATT’S STEAM\r\n    ENGINE--THE CUT-OFF--GIFFARD INJECTOR--BOURDON’S STEAM GAUGE--FEED-\r\n    WATER HEATERS, SMOKE CONSUMERS, ETC.--ROTARY ENGINES--STEAM HAMMER--\r\n    STEAM FIRE ENGINE--COMPOUND ENGINES--SCHLICK AND TAYLOR SYSTEMS OF\r\n    BALANCING MOMENTUM OF MOVING PARTS--STATISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the primeval man first turned upon himself the critical light of\r\nintrospection, and observed his own deficiencies, there were born within\r\nhim both the desire and the determination to supplement his weakness,\r\nand become the ruling factor in the world’s destiny. The strength of his\r\narm unaided could not cope with that of the wild beast, he could not\r\ntravel so fast as the animal, nor soar so high as the bird, nor traverse\r\nthe waters of the sea like the fish. The magnificent power of the\r\nelements first inspired him with awe, then was worshiped as a god, and\r\nhe trembled in his weakness. Then he began to invent, and seeing in\r\nphysical laws an escape from his fears, and a solution for his\r\nambitions, he trained these forces and made them subservient to his\r\nwill, and established his right to rule. Out of the maze of the\r\ncenturies a steam engine is born--not all at once, for that would be\r\ninconsistent with the law of evolution--but gradually growing first into\r\npracticability, then into efficiency, and finally into perfection, it\r\nstands to-day a beautiful monument of man’s ingenuity, throbbing with\r\nlife and energy, and moving the world. What has not the steam engine\r\ndone for the Nineteenth Century? It speeds the locomotive across the\r\ncontinent faster and farther than the birds can fly; no fish can equal\r\nthe mighty steamship on the sea; it grinds our grain; it weaves our\r\ncloth; it prints our books; it forges our steel, and in every department\r\nof life it is the ubiquitous, tireless, potent agency of civilization.\r\nDoes the ambitious young philosopher predict that electricity will\r\nsupersede steam? It is not yet a rational prophecy, for the direct\r\nproduction of electricity from the combustion of coal is still an\r\nunsolved problem, and behind the electric generator can always be found\r\nthe steam engine, modestly and quietly giving its full life’s work to\r\nthe dynamo, which it actuates, and caring nothing for the credit,\r\nunmindful of the beautiful and striking manifestations of electricity\r\nwhich astonish the world, but humbly doing its duty with a silent faith\r\nthat the law of correlation of force will always lead the way back to\r\nthe steam engine, and place it where it belongs, at the head of all\r\nuseful agencies of man.\r\n\r\nThe Nineteenth Century did not include in its discoveries the invention\r\nof the steam engine. The great gift of James Watt was one of the\r\nlegacies which it received from the past, but the economical, efficient,\r\ngraceful, and mathematically perfect engine of to-day is the product of\r\nthis age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--HERO’S ENGINE, 150 B. C.]\r\n\r\nThe genesis of the steam engine belongs to ancient history, for in the\r\nyear 150 B. C. Hero made and exhibited in the Serapeum of Alexandria the\r\nfirst steam engine. It was of the rotary type and was known as the\r\n“aeolipile.” During the middle ages the spirit of invention seems to\r\nhave slept, for nearly eighteen centuries passed from the time of Hero’s\r\nengine before any active revival of interest was manifested in this\r\nfield of invention. Giovanni Branca in 1629, the Marquis of Worcester in\r\n1633, Dr. Papin in 1695, Savary in 1698, and Newcomen in 1705, were the\r\npioneers of Watt, and gave to him a good working basis. Strange as it\r\nmay appear, there was in 1894 and probably still is in existence in\r\nEngland an old Newcomen steam engine (see Fig. 76), which for at least a\r\nhundred years has stood exposed to the weather, slowly rusting and\r\ncrumbling away. It is to be found in Fairbottom Valley, half way between\r\nAshton-under-Lyne and Oldham, and is the property of the trustees of the\r\nlate Earl of Stamford and Warrington. It is erected on a solid masonry\r\npillar 14 by 7 feet at the base, which carries on its top, on trunnions,\r\nan oak beam 20 feet long and 12 by 14 inches thick. This beam is braced\r\nwith iron, and has segmental ends with a piston at one end, and a\r\nbalance weight at the other. The piston and pump rods are attached by\r\nchains. The cylinder is of cast iron, 27 inches in diameter, and about\r\nsix foot stroke, the steam entering at the bottom only. It was formerly\r\nused for pumping a mine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--OLD NEWCOMEN ENGINE.]\r\n\r\nThe distinct and valuable legacy, however, which the Nineteenth Century\r\nreceived from the past, was the double acting steam engine of James\r\nWatt, disclosed in his British Pat. No. 1,321, of 1782. Prior to this\r\ndate steam engines had been almost exclusively confined to raising\r\nwater, but with the invention of Watt it extended into all fields of\r\nindustrial use. Watt’s double acting engine is shown in Fig. 77. It\r\ncomprised a cylinder A, with double acting piston and valve gear E F G\r\nH; the parallel motion R for translating the reciprocating motion of the\r\npiston into the curved oscillatory path of the walking beam; a condenser\r\nchamber K, with spray I, for condensing the exhaust steam; a pump L J to\r\nremove the water from the condenser, and also the air, which is drawn\r\nout of the water by the vacuum; a water supply pump N; the automatic\r\nball governor D, and throttle valve B. Two pins on the pump rod L strike\r\nthe lever H and work the valve gear, and a collecting rod P and crank Q\r\nconvert the oscillations of the walking beam into the continuous\r\nrotation of the fly wheel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--WATT’S DOUBLE ACTING STEAM ENGINE.]\r\n\r\nWatt’s automatic ball governor is shown in Fig. 78 and its function is\r\nas follows: When the working strain on an engine is relieved by the\r\nthrowing out of action of a part of the work being performed, the engine\r\nwould run too fast, or if more than a normal tax were placed on the\r\nengine, it would “slow up.” To secure a regular and uniform motion in\r\nthe performance of his engine Watt invented the automatic or\r\nself-regulating ball governor and throttle valve. A vertical shaft D is\r\nrotated constantly by a band on pulley _d_. Any tendency in the engine\r\nto run too fast throws the balls up by centrifugal action, and this\r\nthrough toggle links _f h_, pulls down on a lever F G H, and partially\r\ncloses the throttle valve Z, reducing the flow of steam to the engine.\r\nWhen the engine has a tendency to run too slow the balls drop down, and,\r\ndeflecting the lever in the opposite direction, open the throttle valve,\r\nand increase the flow of steam to the engine. This double acting engine\r\nof Watt marks the beginning of the great epoch of steam engineering, and\r\nhis patent expired just in time to give to the Nineteenth Century the\r\ngreatest of all natal gifts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--WATT’S AUTOMATIC GOVERNOR AND THROTTLE VALVE.]\r\n\r\nSteam engines are divided into two principal classes, the low pressure\r\nengine, using steam usually under 40 pounds to the square inch, and the\r\nhigh pressure engine, using steam from 50 to 200 pounds. In the low\r\npressure engine there is the expansive pressure of the steam on one side\r\nof the piston, aided by the suction of a vacuum on the opposite side of\r\nthe piston, which vacuum is created by the condensation of the\r\ndischarging, or exhaust steam, by cold water. As there are two factors\r\nat work impelling the piston, only a relatively low pressure in the\r\nboiler is required. In the high pressure engines there is no\r\ncondensation of the exhaust steam, but it is discharged directly into\r\nthe air, and this type was originally called “puffers.” Familiar\r\nexamples of the low pressure type are to be found in our side wheel\r\npassenger steamers, and of the high pressure type in the steam\r\nlocomotive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--PRINCIPLE OF CUT-OFF.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most important steps in the development of the steam engine\r\nwas the addition of the cut-off. Prior to its adoption steam was\r\nadmitted to the cylinder during the whole time the piston was making\r\nits stroke from one end of the cylinder to the other. In the cut-off\r\n(see Fig. 79), when steam is being admitted through the port _p_, and\r\nthe piston is being driven in the direction of the arrow, it was found\r\nthat if the steam were cut off when the piston arrived at the position\r\n1, the expansive action of the steam behind it in chamber _a_ would\r\ncontinue to carry the piston with an effective force to the end of its\r\nstroke, or to position 2. This of course effected a great saving in\r\nsteam. Various cut-offs have been devised. Perhaps that most easily\r\nrecognized by most persons is the one seen in the engine room of our\r\nside wheel steamers, of which illustration is given in Fig. 80. This was\r\ninvented in 1841 by F. E. Sickels, and was the first successful drop\r\ncut-off. It was covered by his patents, May 20, 1842, July 20, 1843,\r\nOctober 19, 1844, No. 3,802, and September 19, 1845, No. 4,201. A rock\r\nshaft _s_ is worked by an eccentric rod _e_ from the paddle wheel shaft.\r\nThe rock shaft has lifting arms _a_ that act upon and alternately raise\r\nthe feet _c_ on rods _b b_. One of these rods _b_ works the valves that\r\nadmit steam, and the other the valves that discharge steam. The valve\r\nrod that admits steam has a quick drop, or fall, to cut off the live\r\nsteam before the piston reaches the end of its stroke. In Fig. 81 is\r\nshown the celebrated Corliss cut-off and valve gear, in which a central\r\nwrist plate and four radiating rods work the valves. This valve gear was\r\ncovered in Corliss patents, No. 6,162, March 10, 1849, and No. 8.253,\r\nJuly 29, 1851.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--SICKELS’ DROP CUT-OFF VALVE GEAR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--CORLISS CUT-OFF AND VALVE GEAR.]\r\n\r\nAmong other important improvements in the steam engine are those for\r\nreplenishing the water in the boiler, and the Giffard Injector is the\r\nsimplest and most ingenious of all boiler feeds. It was invented in 1858\r\nand covered by French patent No. 21,457, May 8, 1858, and U. S. patent\r\nNo. 27,979, April 24, 1860. Prior to the Giffard Injector, steam boilers\r\nwere supplied with water usually by steam pumps, which forced the water\r\ninto the boiler against the pressure of the steam. The Giffard Injector\r\ntakes a jet of steam from the boiler, and causes it to lift the water in\r\nan external pipe, and blow it directly into the boiler against its own\r\npressure. So paradoxical and inoperative did this seem at first that it\r\nwas met with incredulity, and not until repeated demonstrations\r\nestablished the fact was it accepted as an operative device. Its\r\nconstruction is shown in Fig. 82. A is a steam pipe communicating with\r\nthe boiler, B another pipe receiving steam from A through small holes\r\nand terminating in a cone. C is a screw rod, cone-shaped at its\r\nextremity, turned by the crank M, and serving to regulate and even\r\nintercept the passage of steam. D is a water suction pipe. The water\r\nthat is drawn up introduces itself around the steam pipe and tends to\r\nmake its exit through the annular space at the conical extremity of the\r\nlatter steam pipe. This annular space is increased at will by means of\r\nthe lever L, which acts upon a screw whose office is to cause the pipe B\r\nand its attached parts to move backward or forward. E is a diverging\r\ntube which receives the water injected by the jet of steam that\r\ncondenses at I, and imparts to the water a portion of its speed in\r\nproportion to the pressure of the boiler. F is a box carrying a check\r\nvalve to keep the water from issuing from the boiler when the apparatus\r\nis not at work. G is a pipe that leads the injected water to the boiler.\r\nH is a purge or overflow pipe, K a sight hole which permits the\r\noperation of the apparatus to be watched, the stream of water being\r\ndistinctly seen in the free interval. Fig. 83 shows the application of\r\nthe injector to locomotives, which are now almost universally supplied\r\nwith this device.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.--GIFFARD INJECTOR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--INJECTOR ON LOCOMOTIVE.]\r\n\r\nTo keep the pressure in the boiler within the limit of safety, and\r\nadjusted to the work being performed, is an important part of the\r\nengineer’s duty, and this he could not do without the steam gauge. One\r\nof the best known is the Bourdon gauge, shown in Fig. 84, constructed on\r\nthe principle of the barometer invented by Bourdon of Paris in 1849 and\r\npatented in France June, 1849, and in the United States August 3, 1852,\r\nNo. 9,163. A screw threaded thimble B, with stop cock A, is screwed in\r\nthe shell of the boiler, and a coiled pipe C communicates at one end\r\nwith the thimble and is closed at the other end E and connected by a\r\nlink F, with an arm on an axle, carrying an index hand that moves over a\r\ngraduated scale. The coiled pipe C is in the nature of a flattened\r\ntube, as shown in the enlarged cross section, and is enclosed in a case.\r\nWhen the steam pressure varies in this flat tube its coil expands or\r\ncontracts, and in moving the index hand over the scale indicates the\r\ndegree of pressure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.--BOURDON’S PRESSURE GAUGE.]\r\n\r\nIn line with the development of the steam engine must be considered the\r\nefforts to economize fuel. These may be divided into the following\r\nclasses: Increased steam generating surface in boiler construction;\r\nsurface condensers for exhaust steam; devices for promoting the\r\ncombustion of fuel and burning the smoke, and feed water heaters. Even\r\nbefore the Nineteenth Century Smeaton devised the cylindrical boiler\r\ntraversed by a flue, but the multitubular steam boiler of to-day\r\nrepresents a very important Nineteenth Century adjunct to the steam\r\nengine. Our locomotives, fire engines, and torpedo boat engines would be\r\nof no value without it. Sectional steam boilers made in detachable\r\nportions fastened together by packed or screw joints also represent an\r\nimportant development. These permit of the removal and replacement of\r\nany one section that may become defective, and are also capable of being\r\nbuilt up section by section to any size needed. For promoting the\r\ncombustion of fuel the draft is energized by blasts of air or steam, or\r\nboth, either through hollow grate bars, jet pipes in the fire box, or by\r\ndischarging the exhaust steam in the smoke pipe. Surface condensers pass\r\nthe exhaust steam over the great surface area of a multitubular\r\nconstruction having cold water flowing through it. Feed water heaters\r\nutilize the waste heat escaping in the smoke flue to heat the water that\r\nis being fed to the boiler, so that it is warm when it is injected into\r\nthe boiler, and the furnace is relieved of that much work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--BRANCA’S STEAM TURBINE, 1629.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.--SECTION OF PARSONS TURBINE OF 1891.]\r\n\r\nIn the reciprocating type of steam engine the inertia of the piston must\r\nbe overcome at the beginning of each stroke and its momentum must be\r\narrested at the end of each stroke, and this involves a great loss of\r\npower. If the power of the steam could be applied so as to continuously\r\nmove the piston in the same direction this loss would be avoided. The\r\neffort to do this has engaged the attention of many inventors, and the\r\ndevices are called rotary engines. The most successful engines of this\r\nkind are those of the impact type, in which jets of steam impinge upon\r\nbuckets after the manner of water on a water wheel, and which are known\r\nto-day as steam turbines. The earliest of these is Branca’s steam\r\nturbine of 1629 (see Fig. 85) and the most important of this class in\r\nuse to-day are those of Mr. Parsons, of England, and De Laval, of\r\nSweden. The internal construction of the Parsons turbine is seen in Fig.\r\n86 and is covered by British patent No. 10,940, of 1891, and United\r\nStates patent No. 553,658, January 28th, 1896. A series of turbines are\r\nset one after the other on the same axis, so that each takes steam from\r\nthe preceding one, and passes it on to the next. Each consists of a ring\r\nof fixed steam guides on the casing, and a ring of moving blades on the\r\nshaft. The steam passes through the first set of guides, then through\r\nthe first set of moving blades, then through the second set of guides,\r\nand then through the second set of moving blades, and so on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.--PARSONS COMPOUND STEAM TURBINE, ON PLURALITY OF\r\nPROPELLER SHAFTS.]\r\n\r\nIn the application of his turbine to marine propulsion Mr. Parsons\r\nemploys a plurality of propeller shafts and steam turbines, as seen in\r\nFig. 87, and covered under United States patent No. 608,969, August 9,\r\n1898.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.--DE LAVAL’S STEAM TURBINE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.--DE LAVAL TURBINE GEARED TO DYNAMO.]\r\n\r\nThe De Laval turbine, as shown in Fig. 88, is of very simple\r\nconstruction, consisting only of a steel wheel with a series of buckets\r\nat its periphery enclosed by a circular rim, and a series of steam\r\nnozzles on the side with diverging jet orifices directing steam jets\r\nagainst the buckets. A speed of 30,000 revolutions a minute may be\r\nattained by this construction. In Fig. 89 is shown a 300 horse-power\r\nsteam turbine of the De Laval type applied to a dynamo; to which this\r\ntype of engine is peculiarly adapted. The dynamo is seen on the extreme\r\nright, the steam turbine on the extreme left, and the drum-shaped\r\ncasing between contains cog-gearing by which the high revolution of the\r\nturbine wheel is reduced to a proper working speed for the dynamo.\r\nWithin the last few years application of the Parsons steam turbine has\r\nbeen made to marine propulsion with very remarkable results as to speed.\r\nThe small steam craft, “The Turbinia,” built in 1897, and supplied with\r\nthree of Parsons’ compound steam turbines, developed a speed of 32¾\r\nknots, and more recently the torpedo boat “Viper” has with steam\r\nturbines attained the remarkable speed of 37.1 knots, or over 40 statute\r\nmiles an hour. About 2,000 United States patents have been granted on\r\nvarious forms of rotary engines.\r\n\r\nIn the transportation building of the World’s Fair at Chicago in 1893\r\none of the most conspicuous objects of attention was the model of the\r\ngreat Bethlehem Iron Co.’s steam hammer, standing with its feet apart\r\nlike some great “Colossus of Rhodes” and towering 91 feet high among the\r\nmodels of the great ocean steamers and battleships which are so largely\r\ndependent upon the work of this Titanic machine. Its hammer head, in the\r\nworking-machine, weighs 125 tons, and many of the seventeen inch thick\r\narmor plates for our battleships have been forged by its tremendous\r\nblows.\r\n\r\nIn 1838, during the construction of the “Great Britain,” the largest\r\nsteamship up to that time ever built, it was found that there was not a\r\nforge hammer in England or Scotland powerful enough to forge a paddle\r\nshaft for that vessel. The emergency was met by Mr. Nasmyth, of England,\r\nwho invented the steam hammer and covered it in British patent No.\r\n9,382, of 1842 (U. S. Pat. No. 3,042, April 10, 1843). A modern example\r\nof it is seen in Fig. 90. It consists of a steam cylinder at the top\r\nwhose piston is attached to a block of iron, forming the hammer head and\r\nsliding vertically in guides between the two legs of the frame. Valve\r\ngear is arranged to control the flow of steam to and from the opposite\r\nsides of the piston, and so nicely adjusted is the valve gear of such a\r\nmodern steam hammer that it is said that an expert workman can\r\nmanipulate the great mass of metal with such accuracy and delicacy as to\r\ncrack an egg in a wineglass without touching the glass. To the steam\r\nhammer we owe the first heavy armor plate for our battle ships and the\r\npropeller shafts of our earlier steamships. In fact it was the steam\r\nhammer which first rendered the large steamship possible. Mr. Nasmyth\r\nnot only invented the steam hammer, but the steam pile driver as well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.--STEAM HAMMER.]\r\n\r\nFor quick action, nicely adjusted machinery, and showy finish the steam\r\nfire engine is a familiar and conspicuous application of steam power. A\r\ndude among engines when on dress parade, and a sprinter when on the run,\r\nit gets to work with the vim and efficiency of a thoroughbred, and is a\r\nmost business-like and valuable custodian of life and property. The\r\nfirst portable steam fire engine was built about 1830 by Mr. Brathwaite\r\nand Capt. Ericsson in London. In 1841 Mr. Hodges produced a similar\r\nengine in New York City. Cincinnati was the first city to adopt the\r\nsteamer as a part of its fire department apparatus. To-day all the\r\nimportant cities and towns of the civilized world rely upon the steam\r\nfire engines for their longevity and existence. Time economy in getting\r\ninto action is the great objective point of most improvements of the\r\nfire-engine, and one of the most important is the keeping of the water\r\nin the boiler hot when the engine is out of action at the engine house,\r\nso that when the fire is built and the run is made to the scene of\r\naction, the water will be hot to start with. This attachment was the\r\ninvention of William A. Brickill, and was patented by him August 18,\r\n1868, No. 81,132. In the illustration, Fig. 91, the two pipes passing\r\nfrom the engine through the trap door in the floor connect with a water\r\nheater in the basement below, which heater maintains a constant\r\ncirculation of hot water in the steam boiler. Couplings in these pipes\r\nserve to quickly disconnect the engine when the run to the fire is to be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.--STEAM FIRE ENGINE WITH WATER HEATING\r\nATTACHMENT.]\r\n\r\nAmong other useful applications of the steam engine are the steam plow,\r\nsteam drill, steam dredge, steam press, and steam pump, of which latter\r\nthe Blake, Knowles, and Worthington are representative types.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.--THE SIX-CYLINDER QUADRUPLE EXPANSION ENGINES OF\r\nTHE “DEUTSCHLAND,” 35,640 HORSE POWER.]\r\n\r\nThe highest type of modern steam engines is to be found in the compound\r\nmultiple-expansion engine, in which three or more cylinders of different\r\ndiameters with corresponding pistons are so arranged that steam is made\r\nto act first upon the piston in the smallest cylinder at high pressure,\r\nand then discharging into the next larger cylinder, called the\r\nintermediate, acts expansively upon its piston, and thence, passing into\r\nthe still larger low pressure cylinder, imparts its further expansive\r\neffect upon its piston. The fundamental principle of the compound engine\r\ndates back to the time of Watt, its first embodiment appearing in the\r\nHornblower compound engine, as described in British patent No. 1,298, of\r\n1781, but modern improvements have differentiated it into almost a new\r\ninvention. A fine example is shown in Fig. 92, which represents the\r\nquadruple expansion engines of the “Deutschland,” the new steamer of the\r\nHamburg-American Line. The two high pressure cylinders, however, do not\r\nappear in the illustration, being too high for the shops. They stand\r\nvertically, however, upon the two bed plates which appear at the top of\r\nthe two low pressure cylinders. In each set of six cylinders the two low\r\npressure cylinders are in the middle, the two high pressure cylinders\r\nimmediately above them or arranged tandem, while at the forward end is\r\nthe first intermediate cylinder, and at the after end is the second\r\nintermediate. The low pressure cylinders are 106 inches in diameter, the\r\nintermediate cylinders are 73.6 inches and 103.9 inches respectively,\r\nand the two high pressure cylinders are 30.6 inches, and the steam\r\npressure is 225 pounds. Its improvements comprehend the systems of\r\nSchlick, patented in the United States November 23, 1897, No. 594,288\r\nand 594,289, and Taylor, patented November 22, 1898, No. 614,674, which\r\nembody fine mathematical principles for balancing the momentum of the\r\ngreat masses of moving parts, so that the engine may run up to high\r\nspeed without vibrations and damaging strains upon the hull.\r\n\r\nMulhall gives the steam horse power of the world in 1895, not including\r\nwar vessels, as follows:\r\n\r\n                  Stationary.  Railway.   Steamboat.    Total.\r\n  The World       11,340,000  32,235,000  12,005,000  55,580,000\r\n  United States    3,940,000  10,800,000   2,200,000  16,940,000\r\n\r\nThe increase in steam power in the United States has been from 3,500,000\r\nhorse power in 1860, to 16,940,000 horse power in 1895, or about five\r\nfold within thirty-five years.\r\n\r\nProf. Thurston says that in 1890 the combined power of all the steam\r\nengines of the world was not far from 100,000,000[2] horse power, of\r\nwhich the United States had 15,000,000, Great Britain the same, and the\r\nother countries smaller amounts. Taking the horse power as the\r\nequivalent of the work of five men, the work of steam is equivalent to\r\nthat of a population of 500,000,000 working men. It is also said that\r\none man to-day, with the aid of a steam engine, performs the work of 120\r\nmen in the last century.\r\n\r\n  [2] Prof. Thurston’s estimate doubtless includes war vessels, which\r\n      Mulhall’s later estimate does not (see Mulhall’s “Industries and\r\n      Wealth of Nations,” 1896, pages 4 and 379).\r\n\r\nThe influence of the steam engine upon the history and destiny of the\r\nworld is an impressive subject, far beyond any intelligent computation\r\nor estimate. It has been the greatest moving force of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury. The labor of 100,000 men for twenty years might build a great\r\npyramid in Egypt, and it remains as a monument of patience only, but the\r\ngenius of the modern inventor has organized a machine with muscles of\r\nsteel, far more patient and tireless than those of the Egyptian slave.\r\nHe gave it but a drink of water and making coal its black slave, and\r\nhimself the master of both, he has in the Nineteenth Century hitched his\r\nchariot to a star and driven to unparalleled achievement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE STEAM RAILWAY.\r\n\r\n    TREVITHICK’S FIRST LOCOMOTIVE--BLENKINSOP’S LOCOMOTIVE--HEDLEY’S\r\n    “PUFFING BILLY”--STEPHENSON’S LOCOMOTIVE--THE LINK MOTION--STOCKTON\r\n    AND DARLINGTON RAILWAY, 1825--HACKWORTH’S “ROYAL GEORGE”--\r\n    “STOURBRIDGE LION”--“JOHN BULL”--BALDWIN’S LOCOMOTIVES--WESTINGHOUSE\r\n    AIR BRAKES--JANNEY CAR COUPLING--THE WOODRUFF SLEEPING CAR--RAILWAY\r\n    STATISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that more patents have been granted in the class of carriages\r\nand wagons than in any other field, shows that means of transportation\r\nhas engaged the largest share of man’s inventive genius, and has been\r\nmost closely allied to his necessities. The moving of passengers and\r\nfreight seems to be directly related to the progress of civilization,\r\nand the factor whose influence has been most felt in this field is the\r\nsteam locomotive. Sir Isaac Newton in 1680 proposed a steam carriage\r\npropelled by the reaction of a jet of steam. Dr. Robinson in 1759\r\nsuggested the steam carriage to Watt. Cugnot in 1769 built a steam\r\ncarriage. Symington, in 1770, and Murdock, in 1784, built working\r\nmodels, and in 1790 Nathan Read also made experiments in steam\r\ntransportation, but the Nineteenth Century dawned without any other\r\nresults than a few abandoned experiments, and the criticism and\r\ndisappointment of the inventors in this field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.--TREVITHICK’S LOCOMOTIVE, 1804. THE FIRST TO RUN\r\nON RAILS.]\r\n\r\nThe father of the locomotive and the first inventor of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury who directed his energy to its development was Richard\r\nTrevithick, of Camborne, Cornwall. In 1801 he built his first steam\r\ncarriage, adapted to carry seven or eight passengers, which was said to\r\nhave “gone off like a bird,” but broke down, and was taken to the home\r\nof Capt. Vivian, who afterward became a partner of Trevithick. An old\r\nlady, upon seeing this novel and, to her, frightful engine, is said to\r\nhave cried out: “Good gracious! Mr. Vivian, what will be done next? I\r\ncan’t compare it to anything but a walking, puffing devil.” On the 24th\r\nof March, 1802, Trevithick and Vivian obtained British patent No. 2,599\r\nfor their steam carriage, and a second one was built in 1803 which was\r\npopularly known as Capt. Trevithick’s “Puffing Devil.” In 1804, at Pen y\r\nDarran, South Wales, a third engine was built, which was the first\r\nsteam locomotive ever to run on rails. It is seen in the illustration,\r\nNo. 93. It had a horizontal cylinder inside the boiler, a cross head\r\nsliding on guides in front of the engine, the cross head being connected\r\nto a crank on a rear gear wheel, which in turn meshes with an\r\nintermediate gear wheel above and between two other gear wheels on the\r\nrunning wheels. A fly wheel was on the crank shaft. The steam was\r\ndischarged into the chimney, and the whole engine weighed five tons, and\r\nit ran, when loaded, at five miles an hour. In 1808 Trevithick built a\r\ncircular railway at London within an inclosure, and charged a shilling\r\nfor admission to his steam circus and a ride behind his locomotive. The\r\nengine here employed was the “Catch Me Who Can,” and had a vertical\r\ncylinder and piston, without the toothed gear wheels shown in the\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.--BLENKINSOP’S LOCOMOTIVE, 1811.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 94 is shown Blenkinsop’s locomotive of 1811. This was employed\r\nat the Middleton Colliery in hauling coal. It had cog wheels engaging\r\nteeth on the side of the rail. The fire was built in a large tube\r\npassing through the boiler and bent up to form a chimney. Two vertical\r\ncylinders were placed inside the boiler, and the pistons were connected\r\nby cross heads, and, by connecting rods, to cranks on the axles of small\r\ncog wheels engaging with the main cog wheels. It drew thirty tons weight\r\nat three and three-quarter miles an hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.--HEDLEY’S “PUFFING BILLY,” 1813.]\r\n\r\nIn 1813 “Puffing Billy” was built by Wm. Hedley. There were (see Fig.\r\n95) four smooth drive wheels running on smooth rails, which wheels were\r\ncoupled together by intermediate gear wheels on the axle, and all\r\npropelled by a gear wheel in the middle, driven by a connecting rod from\r\nthe walking beam overhead. Hedley’s locomotive was used on the Wylam\r\nrailway, and was said to have been at work more or less until 1862.\r\n\r\nMost prominent among those who took an active interest in the\r\ndevelopment of the locomotive were George Stephenson and his son,\r\nRobert. Stephenson’s first locomotive was tried on the Killingworth\r\nRailway on July 27, 1814. In 1815 Dodds and Stephenson patented an\r\narrangement for attaching the connecting rods to the driving wheels,\r\nwhich took the place of cog wheels heretofore employed, and in the\r\nfollowing year Stephenson, in connection with Mr. Losh, patented the\r\napplication of steam cushion-springs for supporting the weight of the\r\nlocomotive in an elastic manner.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 the Stockton and Darlington Railway, in England, was opened for\r\ntraffic, with George Stephenson’s engine, “Locomotion,” and was put\r\npermanently into service for the transportation of freight and\r\npassengers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.--HACKWORTH’S LOCOMOTIVE, “ROYAL GEORGE,” 1827.]\r\n\r\nIn 1827 Hackworth produced the “Royal George” (see Fig. 96), whose\r\ncylinders were arranged vertically at the rear end of the boiler, and\r\nwhose pistons emerged from the cylinders at the lower ends of the\r\nlatter, and imparted their power through connecting rods to cranks on\r\nthe opposite ends of the axle of the rear driving wheels in a more\r\ndirect manner than heretofore, and doing away with the overhead\r\nmechanism heretofore employed in most engines. Hackworth also improved\r\nthe steam blast, put on the bell, and greatly simplified and modernized\r\nthe appearance of the locomotive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.--GEORGE STEPHENSON’S “ROCKET,” 1829.]\r\n\r\nIn 1829 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was completed, and the\r\ndirectors offered a prize of £500 for the best locomotive. George\r\nStephenson’s “Rocket,” shown in Fig. 97, attained a speed of 24⅙ miles\r\nan hour, and took the prize. Its success, however, was marred by the\r\nfirst railroad fatality, for it ran over and killed a man on this\r\noccasion. It embodied, as leading features, the steam blast and the\r\nmultitubular boiler, which latter was six feet long and had twenty-five\r\nthree-inch tubes. The fire box was surrounded by an exterior casing that\r\nformed a water jacket, which, by means of pipes, was in open\r\ncommunication with the water space of the boiler.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.--“STOURBRIDGE LION,” 1829.]\r\n\r\nThe first practical locomotive to run on a railroad in the United States\r\nwas the “Stourbridge Lion,” seen in Fig. 98. This was imported from\r\nEngland, and arrived in New York in May, 1829, and was tried in that\r\nyear on a section of the Delaware & Hudson Canal Company’s railroad. The\r\nboiler was tubular, and the exhaust steam was carried into the chimney\r\nby a pipe in front of the smoke stack as shown. It had vertical\r\ncylinders of thirty-six inch stroke, with overhead grasshopper beams and\r\nconnecting rods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.--LOCOMOTIVE “JOHN BULL,” 1831.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 99 is shown the “John Bull,” now in the National Museum at\r\nWashington, D. C. It was built by Stephenson & Co. for the Camden &\r\nAmboy Railroad, and was brought over from England and put into service\r\nin 1831. During the Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893, after a\r\nlong rest in the Washington Museum, it made its way under its own steam\r\nto Chicago, drawing a train of two cars a distance of 912 miles without\r\nassistance. It further distinguished itself while there by carrying\r\n50,000 passengers over the exhibition tracks, and although sixty-two\r\nyears of age at the time, showed itself quite capable of performing\r\nsubstantial work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.--BALDWIN’S “OLD IRONSIDES,” 1832.]\r\n\r\nMost of the early locomotives used in America were imported from\r\nEngland, but our inventors soon commenced making them for themselves.\r\nThe Baldwin Locomotive Works, of Philadelphia, has had a notable career\r\nin the field of locomotive construction. “Old Ironsides,” built in\r\n1832, was the first Baldwin locomotive, and it did duty for over a\r\nscore of years. It is shown in Fig. 100. It had four wheels and weighed\r\na little over five tons. The drive wheels were 54 inches in diameter,\r\nand the cylinder 9½ inches in diameter, 18 inches stroke. The wheels had\r\nheavy cast iron hubs with wooden spokes and rims and wrought iron tires,\r\nand the frame was of wood placed outside the wheels. The boiler was 30\r\ninches in diameter and had 72 copper flues 1½ inches in diameter, 7 feet\r\nlong. The price of the locomotive was $4,000, and it attained a speed of\r\n30 miles an hour, with its train.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.--EIGHT-WHEEL PASSENGER EXPRESS LOCOMOTIVE,\r\n1863.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.--EXPRESS PASSENGER LOCOMOTIVE, 1881.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 101 is shown a standard type of passenger locomotive of the\r\nperiod of 1863, and in Fig. 102 is illustrated the period of 1881, which\r\nlatter represents perhaps the greatest epoch of railroad building in the\r\nhistory of the world. According to Poor’s Manual, $1,000,000 a day was\r\nthe estimated cash outlay on this account for the three years up to the\r\nclose of 1882, during which period 28,019 miles of railroad were opened\r\nup in the United States, or more than enough to girdle the entire earth.\r\nSome idea of the wonderful growth of the railroad industry during this\r\nperiod is given by the following tables, which represent the yearly\r\nproduction of locomotives by the Baldwin Company alone for forty years\r\nprior to this period:\r\n\r\n  1842      14\r\n  1843      12\r\n  1844      22\r\n  1845      27\r\n  1846      42\r\n  1847      39\r\n  1848      20\r\n  1849      30\r\n  1850      37\r\n  1851      50\r\n  1852      49\r\n  1853      60\r\n  1854      62\r\n  1855      47\r\n  1856      59\r\n  1857      66\r\n  1858      33\r\n  1859      70\r\n  1860      83\r\n  1861      40\r\n  1862      75\r\n  1863      96\r\n  1864     130\r\n  1865     115\r\n  1866     118\r\n  1867     127\r\n  1868     124\r\n  1869     235\r\n  1870     280\r\n  1871     331\r\n  1872     442\r\n  1873     437\r\n  1874     205\r\n  1875     130\r\n  1876     232\r\n  1877     185\r\n  1878     292\r\n  1879     398\r\n  1880     517\r\n  1881     555\r\n  1882     563\r\n  1883     557\r\n\r\nThe present capacity of the Baldwin works is one thousand locomotives a\r\nyear, and they have built up to this date about fifteen thousand\r\nlocomotives, or nearly one-half of all the locomotives in use in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe successive steps of the development in detail of the various\r\nfeatures of the locomotive are distributed over a long period, and are\r\nsomewhat difficult to trace. The turning of the exhaust steam into the\r\nsmoke stack was done by Trevithick as early as 1804, but its effect was\r\ngreatly increased by Hackworth about 1827, who augmented its power by\r\ndirecting it into the chimney through a narrow orifice. This and the\r\ntubular locomotive boiler by Seguin in 1828, the link-motion in 1832,\r\nthe steam whistle by Stephenson in 1833, the Giffard injector in 1858,\r\nand the Westinghouse air brake of 1869, are the most prominent features\r\nof the locomotive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.--STEPHENSON’S LINK MOTION.]\r\n\r\nThe link motion has been claimed both for the younger Stephenson and W.\r\nT. James, of New York, the latter being probably its real inventor. Its\r\npurpose is to reverse the engine and also to cut off steam in either\r\ndirection, so that it may act expansively. The form of link motion most\r\ngenerally used is shown in Fig. 103, and is known as Stephenson’s. A B\r\nare two eccentrics projecting in opposite directions from the center of\r\nthe common drive shaft, their rods being connected at their outer ends\r\nby a curved and slotted link C D. In the slot of this link plays a pin\r\nE, carried by a pendent swinging lever G F, which lever is jointed at\r\nits lower end to the slide valve rod H. A T-shaped lever I L K M has one\r\narm at I connected by a rod with the slotted link at C. The opposite arm\r\nis provided with a counter weight at K to balance the weight of the link\r\nC D and eccentric rods, and the upright arm is connected at M to a rod\r\noperated by a hand lever P within easy access of the engineer. When the\r\nlink C D is lowered the eccentric B imparts its throw to pendent lever G\r\nF and valve rod H, and the eccentric A will only swing the end C of the\r\nlink without imparting any effect to the valve. When link C D is drawn\r\nup so that pin E is in the bottom of the slot, the eccentric A is active\r\nand B inactive, and as A has an opposite throw to B, the action of the\r\nvalve is reversed. If link C D be drawn half way up, the pin E becomes\r\nthe center of the oscillation of the link, and the valve rod is not\r\nmoved at all. By adjusting the link nearer to or further from the\r\ncentral position, the throw of the slide valve may be made shorter or\r\nlonger, and the steam cut off at a later or earlier period in the stroke\r\nof the piston.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.--LOCOMOTIVE ENGINE NO. 999.]\r\n\r\nFig. 104 is a type of the best modern express locomotive. This is the\r\nfamous 999 of the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad. Its\r\ncylinders are 19 × 24 inches, driving wheels 86½ inches in diameter,\r\nweight 62 tons, steam pressure 190 pounds. This engine hauls the Empire\r\nState Express at a speed of 64.22 miles an hour, excluding stops, or\r\nmore than a mile a minute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.--COMPOUND LOCOMOTIVE.]\r\n\r\nIn securing a higher efficiency and a greater economy in the use of\r\nsteam, the most recent developments in the locomotive have been in the\r\napplication of the principle of the compound expansion engine, in which\r\ntwo or more cylinders of different diameters are used, the steam at high\r\npressure acting in the smaller cylinder, and being then exhausted into\r\nand acting expansively upon the piston of the larger cylinder. A fine\r\nexample of the compound locomotive is shown in Fig. 105. The cylinders\r\nare arranged in pairs, the small high pressure cylinder above, and the\r\nlarger low pressure cylinder below, both piston rods engaging a common\r\ncross head. The application of this principle of the compound engine is\r\nsaid to involve a saving in coal of over 25 per cent.\r\n\r\nProminent among modern improvements in steam railways is the air brake.\r\nThis invention is chiefly the result of the ingenuity of Mr. George\r\nWestinghouse, Jr., who, beginning his experiments in 1869, took out his\r\nfirst patents on the automatic air brake March 5, 1872, Nos. 124,404 and\r\n124,405, which have since been followed up by many others in perfecting\r\nthe system. The principle of the air brake is to store up compressed air\r\nin a reservoir on the locomotive by means of a steam pump. This air\r\npassing through a train pipe connected by hose couplings between cars\r\ncharges an auxiliary reservoir under each car. This reservoir is\r\narranged beside a cylinder having a piston and a triple valve. Pressure\r\nin the train pipe is maintained constantly, and the power to work the\r\npiston to apply the brakes comes from the auxiliary reservoir beside it,\r\nwhich is set into action by a sudden reduction of pressure in the train\r\npipe by the engineer through a special form of valve on the locomotive.\r\nThe air brake is capable of stopping a train at average speed within the\r\ndistance of its own length, and so great a safeguard to life and\r\nproperty is it, that its application to a certain number of cars on\r\nevery train is made compulsory by law.\r\n\r\nThe automatic car coupling is another important life-saving improvement.\r\nMany thousands of these have been patented, but the “Janney” coupling,\r\npatented April 29, 1873, No. 138,405, is the most representative type.\r\nThe year 1900 is to witness the compulsory adoption of automatic car\r\ncouplings on all cars. The “block system” of signals, by which no train\r\nis admitted on to a given section of track until the preceding train has\r\nleft that section, improved switches, which are not dependent upon the\r\nmemory of men, and steel rails, which constitute nine-tenths of all\r\ntracks and serve to increase the stability of the track, are further\r\nmodern safeguards against danger.\r\n\r\nSleeping cars were invented by Woodruff, and patented Dec. 2, 1856, Nos.\r\n16,159 and 16,160. These, with the palace cars of Pullman and Wagner,\r\nthe special refrigerator cars for perishable goods, cars for cattle, and\r\ncars for coal, multiply the equipment, swell the traffic, and supply\r\nevery want of the great railroad systems of modern times.\r\n\r\nThe first railroad in the United States was built near Quincy, Mass., in\r\n1826. The Pacific Railway, the first of our half a dozen\r\ntranscontinental railways, was completed in 1869. The great\r\nTrans-Siberian Railway is nearing completion, and in the Twentieth\r\nCentury a Trans-Sahara Railway will probably relieve the burdens of the\r\ncamel, as it has already done those of the horse.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year 1898 there were in use in the United States\r\n36,746 locomotives, 1,318,700 cars, and the mileage in tracks, including\r\nsecond track and sidings, was 245,238.87, which, if extended in a\r\nstraight line, would build a railway to the moon. The money investment\r\nrepresented in capital stock and bonds was $11,216,886,452. The gross\r\nearnings for the year 1898 were $1,249,558,724. The net earnings were\r\n$389,666,474. Tons of freight moved were 912,973,853. Receipts from\r\nfreight were $868,924,526. Number of passengers carried was 514,982,288.\r\nReceipts from passengers were $272,589,591, and dividends paid were\r\n$94,937,526. Add to the above the elevated railroads and street\r\nrailroads, which are not included, and the immensity of the railroad\r\nbusiness in the United States becomes apparent. In 1898 the United\r\nStates exported 468 locomotives, worth $3,883,719. Mulhall estimates\r\nthat the steam horse power of railroads in the world amounted in 1896 to\r\n40,420,000, of which the United States had more than one-third. He also\r\nstates that the railways in the United States carry _every day_, in\r\nmerchandise, a weight equal to that of the whole of the seventy millions\r\nof persons constituting its population; that the total railway traffic\r\nof the world in 1894 averaged ten million passengers and six million\r\ntons of merchandise _daily_; and that the total railway capital of the\r\nworld reached in that year, 6,745 million sterling, or about\r\nthirty-three billion dollars.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the highest railway speed ever attained by steam prior\r\nto 1900 was by locomotive No. 564 of the Lake Shore & Michigan Southern\r\nRailroad, made during part of a run from Chicago to Buffalo. In this run\r\n86 miles were made at an average rate of 72.92 miles an hour. The train\r\nload was 304,500 pounds, and the 86 mile run included one mile at 92.3\r\nmiles an hour, eight miles at 85.44 miles an hour, and thirty-three\r\nmiles at 80.6 miles an hour. On May 26, 1900, however, an experiment on\r\nthe Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, made by Mr. F. U. Adams between Baltimore\r\nand Washington, demonstrated that by sheathing the train to prevent\r\nretardation by the air, an average speed of 78.6 miles an hour was\r\nobtained, and for five miles on a down grade a speed of 102.8 miles an\r\nhour was reached.\r\n\r\nThe largest and most powerful locomotives in the world are those being\r\nbuilt for the Pittsburg, Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad for hauling long\r\ntrains of iron and ore, one of which has just been completed. Its\r\ncylinders are 24 × 32 inches; drive wheels, 54 inches diameter; weight,\r\n125 tons; draw bar pull 56,300 pounds, and hauling capacity 7,847 tons.\r\nOne of these mammoth engines is capable of drawing a train of box cars,\r\nloaded with wheat, and more than a mile long, at a speed of ten miles an\r\nhour. This load of wheat would represent the yield of 14 square miles of\r\nland. No doubt it would greatly astonish our forefathers to know that at\r\nthe end of the century we would have iron horses capable of carting\r\naway, at a single load, the products of 14 square miles of the country\r\nside, and do it at a gait faster than that of their local mail coach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nSTEAM NAVIGATION.\r\n\r\n    EARLY EXPERIMENTS--SYMINGTON’S BOAT--COL. JOHN STEVENS’ SCREW\r\n    PROPELLER--ROBT. FULTON AND THE “CLERMONT”--FIRST TRIP TO SEA BY\r\n    STEVENS’ “PHŒNIX”--“SAVANNAH,” THE FIRST STEAM VESSEL TO CROSS THE\r\n    OCEAN--ERICSSON’S SCREW PROPELLER--THE “GREAT EASTERN”--THE\r\n    WHALEBACK STEAMERS--OCEAN GREYHOUNDS--THE “OCEANIC,” LARGEST\r\n    STEAMSHIP IN THE WORLD--THE “TURBINIA”--FULTON’S “DEMOLOGOS,” FIRST\r\n    WAR VESSEL--THE TURRET MONITOR--MODERN BATTLESHIPS AND TORPEDO\r\n    BOATS--HOLLAND SUBMARINE BOAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe application of steam for the propulsion of boats engaged the\r\nattention of inventors along with the very earliest development of the\r\nsteam engine itself. Blasco de Garay in 1543, the Marquis of Worcester\r\nin 1655, Savary in 1698, Denys Papin in 1707, Dr. John Allen in 1730,\r\nJonathan Hulls in 1737, Bernouilli and Genevois in 1757, William Henry\r\n(of Pennsylvania) in 1763, Count D’Auxiron and M. Perier in 1774, the\r\nMarquis de Jouffroy in 1781, James Rumsey (on the Potomac) in 1782,\r\nBenjamin Franklin and Oliver Evans in 1786 and 1789, John Fitch in 1786,\r\nand also again in 1796, and William Symington in 1788-89 were the early\r\nexperimenters. Papin’s boat was said to have been used on the Fulda at\r\nCassel, and was reported to have been destroyed by bargemen, who feared\r\nthat it would deprive them of a livelihood. Allen, Rumsey, Franklin, and\r\nEvans (1786) proposed to employ a backwardly discharged column of water\r\nissuing from a pump. Jonathan Hulls and Oliver Evans (1789) had stern\r\nwheels. Bernouilli, Genevois, and the Marquis de Jouffroy used paddles\r\non the duck’s foot principle, which closed when dragged forward, and\r\nexpanded when pushed to the rear. Fitch’s first boat employed a system\r\nof paddles suspended by their handles from cranks, which, in revolving,\r\ngave the paddles a motion simulating that which the Indian imparts to\r\nhis paddle. Symington’s boat of 1788 (Patrick Miller’s pleasure boat)\r\nhad side paddle wheels. Symington’s next boat, built in 1789, and also\r\nowned by Patrick Miller, was of the catamaran type, _i. e._, it had two\r\nparallel hulls with paddle wheels between them.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of this art when the Nineteenth Century commenced its\r\nwonderful record. No practical steam vessel had been constructed, as\r\nthe efforts in this direction were handicapped by the crudeness of all\r\nthe arts, and were to be regarded as experiments only, most of which had\r\nto be abandoned. The seed of this invention, however, had been sown in\r\nthe fertile soil of genius, conception of its great possibilities had\r\nfired the zeal of the inventors in this field, and the new century was\r\nshortly to number among its great resources a practical and efficient\r\nsteamboat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.--SYMINGTON’S STEAMBOAT, 1801.]\r\n\r\nThe first steamboat of the Nineteenth Century was the “Charlotte\r\nDundas,” built by William Symington in 1801, see Fig. 106, and used on\r\nthe Forth and Clyde Canal in 1802. She had a double acting “Watt\r\nengine,” which transmitted power by a connecting rod to a crank on the\r\npaddle-wheel shaft. The boat had a single paddle wheel in the middle\r\nnear the stern, and was intended only for canal use, in the place of\r\nhorses. It was abandoned for fear of washing the banks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.--STEVENS’ TWIN SCREW PROPELLER AND ENGINE,\r\n1804.]\r\n\r\nIn 1804 Col. John Stevens constructed a boat on the Hudson, driven by a\r\nWatt engine, and having a tubular boiler of his own invention and a twin\r\nscrew propeller. The engine, boiler, and twin screws are shown in Fig.\r\n107. The same year Oliver Evans used a stern paddle wheel boat on the\r\nDelaware and Schuylkill rivers. It was driven by a double acting high\r\npressure engine, and geared so as to rotate wagon wheels by which it was\r\ntransported on land, as well as the paddle wheels when on the water. It\r\nwas in primitive form both a locomotive and a steamboat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.--THE “CLERMONT,” 1807.]\r\n\r\nIn 1807 Robert Fulton built the “Clermont,” and permanently established\r\nsteam navigation on the Hudson River between New York and Albany. Fulton\r\nin 1802-1803, while living in Paris with Mr. Joel Barlow, and with the\r\naid and encouragement of Chancellor Livingston, of New Jersey, had built\r\nan earlier steamboat 86 feet long, and although it broke down owing to\r\ndefects in the strength of the hull, he was so encouraged that he\r\nordered Messrs. Boulton & Watt, of England, to send to America a new\r\nsteam engine, and upon his return to America he built the “Clermont.”\r\nThis vessel, although not the first steamboat, was nevertheless the\r\nfirst to make a voyage of any considerable length, and to run regularly\r\nand continuously for practical purposes, and Fulton was the first\r\ninventor in this field whose labors were not to be classed as an\r\nabandoned experiment. The “Clermont” as originally built was quite a\r\ndifferent looking boat from that usually given in the histories. A model\r\nof the original construction is to be found in the National Museum at\r\nWashington. In the winter of 1807-8 she was remodeled as shown in Fig.\r\n108. She then appeared as a side wheel steamer, whose wheels were\r\nprovided with outer guards and enclosed in side wheel houses, and whose\r\nshaft had outer bearings in the guards, which were not in the original\r\nboat. The hull was 133 feet long, 18 feet beam, and 7 feet depth. The\r\n“Clermont’s” engines were coupled to the crank shaft by a bell crank,\r\nand the paddle wheel shaft was separated from the crank shaft, but\r\nconnected with it by gearing. The cylinders were 24 inches in diameter,\r\nand 4 foot stroke. The paddle wheels had buckets 4 feet long with a dip\r\nof 2 feet. She made the first trip from New York to Albany of 150 miles\r\nin 32 hours, and returned in 30 hours, which was the first voyage of any\r\nconsiderable length ever made by steam power.\r\n\r\nThe honor of inventing the steamboat has been claimed for many\r\ninventors, and that many worthy experimenters had been working in this\r\nfield, and that Fulton had the benefit of their experience is true. The\r\nfact is, however, that the evolution of any great, invention is a slow\r\nand cumulative process, the product of many minds, and while the\r\nproposers, suggesters, and experimenters are entitled to their share of\r\nthe credit, it is the man who achieves success and gives to the public\r\nthe benefit of his labors whom the world honors, and in this connection\r\nthe name of Fulton stands pre-eminent, for although the “Clermont” was\r\n264 years later than the steamboat of Blasco de Garay, the “Clermont”\r\nmarks the beginning of practical steam navigation, and whatever the\r\nclaims of other inventors may be, it is certain that steam navigation,\r\nestablished by Fulton in 1807, on the Hudson, preceded the practical use\r\nof the steamboat in any other country by at least five years, for it was\r\nnot until 1812 that Henry Bell, of Scotland, built the “Comet,” that\r\nplied between Glasgow and Greenock, on the Clyde, and not until 1814 was\r\na steam packet used for hire on the Thames in England.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that Fulton was in Paris making his first experiments\r\nwith the steamboat, Col. John Stevens, the most celebrated boat builder\r\nand engineer of his day, was actively experimenting in America in the\r\nsame line. Having in 1804 made the first application of steam to the\r\nscrew propeller, he in 1807 built the “Phœnix,” which was driven by\r\npaddle wheels. The “Phœnix” was constructed shortly after Fulton’s boat,\r\nbut was barred from use on the Hudson by the exclusive monopoly obtained\r\nby Fulton and Livingston from the State Legislature, and she was\r\naccordingly taken from New York to Philadelphia by sea, which was the\r\nfirst ocean voyage by a steam vessel.\r\n\r\nThe first steamboat on the Mississippi was the “Orleans,” of 100 tons,\r\nbuilt at Pittsburg by Fulton and Livingston in 1811. She had a stern\r\nwheel, and went from Pittsburg to New Orleans in 14 days.\r\n\r\nAlthough the first trip out to sea was made in 1808 by Col. Stevens’ son\r\nin taking the “Phœnix” from New York to Philadelphia, no attempt had\r\nbeen made to cross the ocean until 1819. In this year the “Savannah,” an\r\nAmerican steamer of 380 tons, performed this feat, and had the honor of\r\nbeing the first steam vessel to cross the Atlantic. In 1824 the\r\n“Enterprise,” an English steamer, rounded the Cape of Good Hope and went\r\nto India.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.--SCREW PROPELLER OF THE “ROBT. F. STOCKTON,”\r\nERICSSON’S PATENT, 1836.]\r\n\r\nThe screw propeller employed by Colonel Stevens in 1804 was not a new\r\ninvention with him, as popularly supposed, but had its origin early in\r\nthe preceding century, being a mere development of the ancient wind\r\nwheel. In 1836 it was further developed by Francis P. Smith and by Capt.\r\nJohn Ericsson, then living in England. Ericsson took out British patent\r\nNo. 7,149, of 1836, and United States patent No. 588, of Feb. 1, 1838,\r\nand built several screw steamers, and through Capt. Robert F. Stockton,\r\nof the United States Navy, succeeded in having a screw steamer, the\r\n“Robert F. Stockton,” built in accordance with the plans of his patent\r\nand sent to the United States. The arrangement of her machinery is seen\r\nin Fig. 109. She had two propellers on the same axis, but revolving in\r\nopposite directions, one being on the central shaft and the other on a\r\nconcentric tube. The engines were coupled directly to the propeller\r\nshafts, which feature was one of Ericsson’s improvements, and has\r\ncontinued to be the approved form to this day.\r\n\r\nIn the early history of steam navigation the side wheel steamer was the\r\nfavorite, and was employed for ocean travel as well as for inland\r\nwaters. In 1840 the “Brittania,” the first Cunarder, commenced the\r\ncareer of that celebrated line. This vessel had side wheels, as did also\r\nthe “United States,” shown in Fig. 110, which was the first American\r\nsteamer built expressly for the Atlantic trade. In 1852 the United\r\nStates mail steamer “Arctic,” of the Collins line, was regarded as the\r\ngreyhound of the Atlantic, her time being 9 days, 17 hours and 12\r\nminutes. She also had side wheels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.--STEAMER “UNITED STATES,” 1847.]\r\n\r\nSide wheel steamers for inland waters, and screw propellers for sea\r\nservice, however, in time established their fitness for their respective\r\nscenes of action. In side wheel steamers the most notable improvements\r\nhave been in stiffening the hull by braces, and the adoption of\r\nfeathering paddle wheels, whose function is to cause the paddles to\r\nenter and leave the water in vertical position without dragging dead\r\nwater. Manley in 1862, and Morgan in 1875, patented practical forms of\r\nthe feathering paddle wheel. In screw propellers, Woodcroft in 1832, and\r\nGriffiths at a later period, made valuable improvements. The surface\r\ncondenser was used by Hall in 1838 on the steamship “Wilberforce,” and\r\nSickels in 1841 invented the drop cut-off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n             {“GREAT EASTERN,” SCREW AND PADDLE WHEELS, 1858.

LENGTH, 704 FEET, SPEED, 20\r\n             {KNOTS.]\r\n\r\nIn 1854 the “Great Eastern” was begun and was finished in 1858. This was\r\nthe largest steam vessel ever built up to this time, and has continued\r\nto hold the record for size up to the year 1899, when her dimensions\r\nwere exceeded by the “Oceanic,” which ships are put in comparison in\r\nFig. 111. The length of the “Great Eastern” was 692 feet, beam 83 feet,\r\ndepth 57½ feet, draft 25½ feet, displacement 27,000 tons, and speed 12\r\nknots. She was designed by the English engineer Brunel, and was intended\r\nfor the Australian trade. She had both a screw propeller and paddle\r\nwheels at the side, with four engines coupled to each. The paddle wheel\r\nengines had steam cylinders 74 inches in diameter, with 14 foot stroke,\r\nand those of the screw engines were 84 inches in diameter and 4 foot\r\nstroke. Collectively they were of 10,000 horse power. The paddle wheels\r\nwere 56 feet in diameter, and the screw propeller 24 feet. On her first\r\nvoyage to New York, across the Atlantic, in 1860, she carried from 15 to\r\n24 pounds of steam and consumed 2,877 tons of coal. Her cost was\r\n$3,831,520. This mammoth vessel was too large and unwieldy for the uses\r\nfor which she was designed, and proved a bad investment. She served,\r\nhowever, a most useful purpose, by virtue of her great bulk, steadiness,\r\nand carrying capacity, for relaying the Atlantic cable in 1866, and\r\nothers in 1873-1874.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 the “Castalia” was built. This was a steamer with two parallel\r\nhulls, decked across, and designed for greater steadiness in crossing\r\nthe English Channel. The “Bessemer” steamer, designed for the same\r\npurpose, and built about the same time, had four paddle wheels, and the\r\nentire cabin was hung on pivots, so that it could not partake of the sea\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nIn later years great improvements have been made in reducing the weight\r\nof the engines, in forced blast, steam steering gear, anchor hoisting\r\ndevices, water-tight bulkheads, surface condensers, electric lights, and\r\nsignalling devices. By the year 1880 the standard form of marine engine\r\nfor large powers had become the compound double cylinder type, expanding\r\nsteam from an initial pressure as high as 90 pounds. In 1890 triple\r\nexpansion engines had become common, employing three cylinders, and\r\nusing steam with an initial pressure as high as 180 pounds. In 1890\r\nMcDougal’s whale-back steamers were introduced. See United States\r\npatents No. 429,467 and 429,468, June 3, 1890, and No. 500,411, June 27,\r\n1893.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.--STEAMBOAT “PRISCILLA.”]\r\n\r\nIn no country in the world are such fine examples of side wheel steamers\r\nto be found as in the United States, and in no country are there such\r\nsplendid reaches of inland waters as theatres for their performances.\r\nThe “Priscilla,” shown in Fig. 112, of the Fall River Line, plying on\r\nLong Island Sound, and the “Adirondack,” on the Hudson, are fine\r\nexamples of this type. The “Priscilla,” which is said to be the largest\r\nriver boat in the world, is 440 feet 6 inches long and 93 feet breadth\r\nover the guards. She is driven by double compound inclined engines, has\r\nfeathering paddle wheels 35 feet in diameter and 14 feet face, and her\r\nspeed is over 20 miles an hour. The “Adirondack,” whose engines and\r\nfeathering paddle wheel are shown in Fig. 113, is 412 feet long and 90\r\nfeet breadth over guards. The engines and paddle wheels of the\r\n“Adirondack” are distinctly representative of the modern American side\r\nwheel steamer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.--ENGINES AND PADDLE WHEEL OF STEAMER\r\n“ADIRONDACK” ON THE HUDSON RIVER.]\r\n\r\nThe largest and in many respects the highest type of marine architecture\r\nis to be found in the modern ocean greyhound for transatlantic trade. In\r\nrecent years the rival companies have vied with each other in the effort\r\nto excel, and steamships of larger size, greater speed, and more perfect\r\nequipment have followed each other, until it would seem that the limit\r\nhad been reached. In the accompanying table the largest and most recent\r\nsteamers are placed in comparison with the “Great Eastern.”\r\n\r\nDIMENSIONS OF THE LARGEST OCEAN STEAMERS.\r\n\r\n  ==============+======+=======+======+======+========+=========+=======\r\n  NAME OF       | DATE.|LENGTH | BEAM.|DEPTH.|DRAUGHT.|DISPLACE-|MAXIMUM\r\n  SHIP.         |      | OVER  |      |      |        |  MENT.  |SPEED.\r\n                |      | ALL.  |      |      |        |         |\r\n  --------------+------+-------+------+------+--------|---------+-------\r\n                |      | FEET. | FEET.| FEET.| FEET.  |   TONS. | KNOTS.\r\n  Great Eastern | 1858 |  692  |  83  |  57½ |   25½  |  27,000 | 12\r\n  Paris         | 1888 |  560  |  63  |  42  |   26½  |  13,000 | 20\r\n  Teutonic      | 1890 |  585  |  57½ |  42  |   26   |  12,000 | 20\r\n  Campania      | 1893 |  625  |  65  |  41½ |   28   |  19,000 | 22\r\n  St. Paul      | 1895 |  554  |  63  |  42  |   27   |  14,000 | 21\r\n  Kaiser Wilhelm| 1897 |  649  |  66  |  43  |   29   |  20,000 | 22.35\r\n    der Grosse  |      |       |      |      |        |         |\r\n  Oceanic       | 1899 |  704  |  68  |  49  |   32½  |  28,500 | 20\r\n  Deutschland   | 1900 |  686½ |  67⅓ |  44  |   29   |  22,000 | 23½\r\n  ==============+======+=======+======+======+========+=========+=======\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.--“KAISER WILHELM DER GROSSE.”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.--“OCEANIC” COMPARED WITH BROADWAY BUILDINGS.]\r\n\r\nThe “Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse,” owned by the North German Lloyd\r\nCompany, and built in 1897, is shown in Fig. 114, and for three years\r\nheld the record as the fastest steamship afloat. The “Kaiser Wilhelm”\r\nwas followed by the “Oceanic,” in 1899, of the White Star Company, which\r\nis the largest ocean steamer ever built, exceeding the proportions of\r\nthe “Great Eastern.” Just what the dimensions of the “Oceanic” mean, as\r\ngiven in the preceding tables, can be best illustrated by the\r\naccompanying Fig. 115, in which she is juxtaposed with several blocks of\r\nlarge buildings on Broadway, New York, opposite City Hall Park. If the\r\n“Oceanic” were placed on end beside Washington’s Monument, at the United\r\nStates Capital, she would tower 150 feet above the top of the same. An\r\nordinary brick house four rooms deep and three stories high could be\r\nbuilt with its length crosswise in her hull. There is accommodation for\r\n410 first-class passengers, 300 second-class passengers, and 1,000 third\r\nclass, and as her crew will number 390, the total number of souls on\r\nboard, when she carries her full complement, will be 2,100.\r\n\r\nThe latest achievement in marine architecture, however, is the\r\n“Deutschland,” built for the Hamburg-American Company. The “Deutschland”\r\nis not quite so large as the “Oceanic,” but is of higher speed, her\r\nmaximum speed of 23½ knots an hour exceeding that of any other ocean\r\nsteamer. The “Savannah,” the first steam vessel to cross the Atlantic,\r\nmade the trip in 1819 in 26 days. The “Deutschland” in her eastward trip\r\nSeptember 4, 1900, crossed the Atlantic in 5 days 7 hours and 38\r\nminutes, which is the fastest time on record. The “Deutschland” is of\r\n35,640 horse power, her two bronze propellers are 23 feet diameter, and\r\nweigh 30 tons, and her propeller shafts are 25 inches in diameter. The\r\ncranks of her propeller shafts, like those of the “Kaiser Wilhelm” and\r\nthe “Oceanic,” are set according to the Schlick system, to reduce\r\nvibration. The “Deutschland’s” engines are seen in Fig. 92, and in\r\ngeneral appearance the ship resembles the “Kaiser Wilhelm.” Still larger\r\nand possibly swifter steamships are in process of construction, viz.:\r\nthe “Kaiser Wilhelm II.,” by the North German Lloyd Company, and a\r\nmammoth unnamed ship by the White Star Line, whose length of 750 feet\r\nwill exceed all others.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to note in familiar terms what these enormous\r\ntraveling palaces comprehend in equipment. For the safety and comfort of\r\npassengers, the great length reduces the pitching, bilge keels prevent\r\nrolling, and the Schlick system of cranks neutralizes vibration in the\r\nengine. Strong bulkheads, and double bottoms with air-tight\r\ncompartments, impart buoyancy in case of collision. Boilers are placed\r\nin separate water-tight compartments, so that damage to one does not\r\ndisable the others. Powerful pumps are arranged to discharge inflowing\r\nwater, and the best of life boats are provided. Spacious dining rooms,\r\npromenade decks, drawing rooms, pianos, library, smoking room, state\r\nrooms, cabins for children, toilets, baths, medicine stores, a printing\r\noffice, and electric lights everywhere, furnish every want and satisfy\r\nevery luxurious taste. The cuisine includes a refrigerating plant, the\r\nfinest ranges, and provisions galore. It may be interesting to the\r\nhousewife to see the market list of a modern transatlantic steamer. A\r\nspecimen is partially represented in the following: 25,450 pounds of\r\nfresh meat, 3,250 pounds of fish, 6,370 pounds of game and poultry,\r\n12,715 pounds of bread, 43 barrels of flour, 3,938 pounds of butter,\r\n1,307 pounds of coffee, 2,790 pounds of sugar, 102 pounds of tea, 7,220\r\npounds of fresh fruit; 1,230 gallons of milk, 26,106 eggs, 29,180\r\noranges and lemons, 7,033 bottles of mineral water, 1,800 bottles of\r\nbeer, 2,688 gallons of beer in casks, 1,240 bottles of wine, 630 bottles\r\nof champagne, 1,600 heads of lettuce, 800 jars of preserved fruits, and\r\nother things in proportion.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of size the “Oceanic” surpasses all previous efforts in\r\nship building, but ocean steamers do not reach the highest speed\r\nattainable. The little “Turbinia,” a 40 ton craft equipped with a\r\ncompound rotary steam turbine of the Parsons type, has attained a speed\r\nof 32¾ knots an hour. An even greater speed has recently been attained\r\nby the larger boat, “Hai Lung,” constructed in England for the Chinese\r\nGovernment, which vessel was equipped with reciprocating engines, and is\r\ncredited with having made a run of 18½ knots at an average speed of 35\r\nknots an hour. The highest speed ever attained, however, is by the\r\nBritish torpedo boat “Viper,” which is 210 feet long, and, like the\r\n“Turbinia,” is equipped with the Parsons steam turbines. In a recent\r\ntrial the “Viper” covered a measured mile at the rate of 37.1 knots, or\r\nabout 43 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nIn many respects the most important branch of steam navigation in recent\r\nyears has been its war vessels. The great navies of the world at the end\r\nof 1898[3] ranked as follows: England, 1,557,522 tons; France, 731,629\r\ntons; Russia, 453,899 tons; United States, 303,070 tons; Germany,\r\n299,637 tons; Italy, 286,175 tons, and they all owe their efficiency\r\nentirely to steam. The first steam war vessel was built in 1814 by\r\nFulton for the defence of New York Harbor, during the then existing war\r\ntimes. She was known as the “Demologos” (voice of the people), or\r\n“Fulton the First.” As shown in the original designs, Fig. 116, she is a\r\ndouble ender, whose sides were to be 5 feet thick. In her middle was a\r\nchannel way or well containing a protected paddle wheel 16 feet in\r\ndiameter, 14 feet wide, and having a dip of 4 feet. A single cylinder\r\nengine turned the paddle wheel on one side, and was balanced by the\r\nboiler on the other side. Although intended to have only twenty guns,\r\nshe was equipped, when finished, with thirty long 32-pounder guns and\r\ntwo Columbiad 100-pounders. It was proposed also to have submarine guns\r\nsuspended from each bow. An engine was also to be used to discharge hot\r\nwater on the enemy, and a furnace was to be provided for heating the\r\ncannon balls red hot. She was 156 feet long, 20 feet deep, and 56 feet\r\nbroad, and was regarded as a very formidable vessel. Her cost was\r\n$278,544. Iron-clad floating batteries were first used in 1855 in the\r\nCrimean war, and shortly afterward the French built the first sea-going\r\niron-clad, “Gloire,” followed in 1859 by the British iron-clad,\r\n“Warrior.”\r\n\r\n  [3] The figures represent a selective list which excludes about 15 per\r\n      cent. of old and inefficient vessels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “DEMOLOGOS”\r\n\r\nFigure I^{st} Transverse section A _her Boiler,_ B _the steam Engine,_ C\r\n_the water-wheel,_\r\n\r\nEE _her wooden walls 5 feet thick, diminishing to below the waterline as\r\nat_ FF.\r\n\r\n_draught of water 9 feet_ DD _her gun deck._\r\n\r\nFigure II^{d} _This shews her gun deck. 140 feet long,\r\n\r\n24 feet wide; mounting 20 guns_ A _the Water wheel_\r\n\r\nFigure III^{d}\r\n\r\n_Side View_\r\n\r\nFIG. 116.]\r\n\r\nThe civil war in 1861 brought with it a novel and striking form of war\r\nvessel known as the “Monitor.”[4] It was built from plans of Capt.\r\nEricsson, an engineer of the ripest experience, skill, and attainments,\r\nwho had then come to make his home in the United States. He undertook to\r\nconstruct for the Navy Department of the United States some form of iron\r\nclad steam batteries of light draft, suitable to navigate the rivers and\r\nharbors of the Confederate States. The “Monitor” was the result. The\r\nsalient features, shown in vertical cross section in Fig. 117, are a low\r\ndeck projecting but a few inches above the water line, so as to present\r\nas little target as possible to the enemy, and a revolving and heavily\r\narmored turret containing the battery of guns. In 1862 the Confederate\r\nforces had reconstructed a steam vessel with a chicken-coop-shaped\r\ncovering of armor, that proved a formidable engine of war, which was\r\npractically invulnerable to the attacks of ordinary war vessels, and was\r\ndoing great damage to the Union vessels. In the spring of 1862 the\r\n“Monitor” met the “Merrimac” in engagement in Hampton Roads, and\r\nestablished the great value of the turret monitor.\r\n\r\n  [4] The revolving turret was invented and patented by Theodore R.\r\n      Timby, No. 35,846, July 8, 1862, and No. 36,593, September 30,\r\n      1862.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.--CROSS SECTION OF “MONITOR.”]\r\n\r\nVessels of the “Monitor” type still form useful parts of the United\r\nStates Navy, in which the “Monterey” and “Monadnock” are its most\r\nrepresentative types. The “Monadnock,” which is a double-turret coast\r\ndefence monitor, is shown in Fig. 118. Although regarded by some as\r\nunseaworthy on account of the low seaboard and small buoyancy, the\r\nmonitor has cleared itself of such suspicion, for in the recent war with\r\nSpain both the “Monadnock” and “Monterey” sailed across the Pacific\r\nOcean by way of Honolulu to Manila, a distance of 7,000 miles, and\r\njoined the fleet of Admiral Dewey without mishap or delay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.--MONITOR “MONADNOCK.”]\r\n\r\nNo patriotic American citizen would expect to read an account of modern\r\nwar vessels without finding special mention of those two splendid\r\ntypes of their class, the battleship “Oregon” and the armored cruiser\r\n“Brooklyn,” whose performances during the late war with Spain\r\ncontributed so much to the honor and glory of the United States Navy,\r\nand demonstrated the skill and efficiency of our American shipbuilders.\r\nBefore the war began the “Oregon” was stationed on the Pacific Coast,\r\nwhere she had been built, and it was desired that she should join the\r\nfleet of Admiral Sampson in Cuban waters. Leaving Puget Sound on March\r\n6, 1898, this floating fortress of steel, weighted with her enormous\r\nguns and 18-inch thick armor, made the long journey of over 14,500 miles\r\naround the southern end of the western continent, and up to Jupiter\r\nInlet on the Florida coast, arriving there on the 24th day of May, and\r\nwas not delayed an hour on account of her machinery, the only stops\r\nbeing made for coal. Immediately after coaling at Key West she took her\r\nplace in the blockading line at Santiago, and in the great battle of\r\nJuly 3 quickly developed a power greater than that attained on her trial\r\ntrip and a speed only slightly less, easily distancing all other ships\r\nimmediately engaged except the “Brooklyn,” and in connection with the\r\n“Brooklyn” forced the fleetest of the Spanish cruisers to surrender.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.--BATTLESHIP “OREGON.”]\r\n\r\nThe “Oregon” is shown in Fig. 119. She is an armored battleship of the\r\nfirst class, built by the Union Iron Works of San Francisco, and\r\nlaunched Oct. 26, 1893. Her length is 348 feet, beam 69¼ feet, draft 24\r\nfeet, displacement 10,288 tons, maximum speed 16.79 knots, and coal\r\ncapacity 1,594 tons. Her side armor is of steel plates 18 inches thick,\r\nand her deck is, 2¾ inches thick. On the turrets the armor is from 6 to\r\n15 inches thick, and on the barbettes it is from 6 to 17 inches thick.\r\nHer engines are of the twin screw, vertical triple expansion direct\r\nacting inverted cylinder type. The stroke is 42 inches, and the\r\ndiameters of the cylinders are 34½, 48, and 75 inches, respectively. The\r\nbattery consists of four 13-inch breech loading rifles, eight 8-inch\r\nbreech loading rifles, four 6-inch, twenty 6-pounder rapid fire guns,\r\nsix 1-pounder rapid fire, two Colts, one 3-inch rapid fire field gun,\r\nand three torpedo tubes. The 13-inch guns weigh 136,000 pounds each, are\r\n39 feet 9¼ inches long, are set 18 feet above the water, can be moved\r\nthrough an arc of 270 degrees, and throw a projectile of 1,100 pounds a\r\ndistance of 12 miles, and with a power which at 1,000 yards would\r\nperforate a mass of steel 2½ feet in thickness. The cost of the “Oregon”\r\nwas $3,180,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.--ARMORED CRUISER “BROOKLYN.”]\r\n\r\nThe “Brooklyn” is shown in Fig. 120, and enjoys the distinction of\r\nhaving borne the brunt of the fight of July 3, 1898, having been hit\r\nover forty times in that engagement without being disabled. She was\r\nbuilt by the William Cramp & Sons Ship and Engine Building Company, of\r\nPhiladelphia, was launched Oct. 2, 1895, and cost $2,986,000. She is an\r\narmored cruiser, and is one of the latest and most speedy of that type.\r\nShe is 400 feet 6 inches long, 64 feet 8 inches breadth, 24 feet draft,\r\n9,215 tons displacement. Her engines are the twin-screw vertical triple\r\nexpansion type, imparting a speed of 21.91 knots an hour. Her maximum\r\nindicated horse power is 18,769, and her coal capacity is 1,461 tons.\r\nHer battery consists of eight 8-inch breech loading rifles, twelve\r\n5-inch rapid fire guns, twelve 6-pounder rapid fire, four 1-pounder\r\nrapid fire, four Colts, two 3-inch rapid fire field guns, and four\r\nWhitehead torpedo tubes. Her side armor is 3 inches thick, her turrets\r\n5½ inches, her barbettes from 4 to 8 inches, and her deck from 3 to 6\r\ninches. She also has a water line protection of cocoa fibre to\r\nautomatically close up an opening made by a shot.\r\n\r\nAlthough not a steam vessel, it would be regarded as an omission not to\r\nmention among war vessels the “Holland” submarine boat, brought into\r\nnotice in 1898 by the Spanish American war, and designed to dive below\r\nthe surface and make attack below the water level. Torpedo boats of this\r\ntype have been acquired by, and now form a part of, the United States\r\nNavy.\r\n\r\nAmong all the types of steam war vessels which have claimed popular\r\nattention the most interesting in proportion to its size is the torpedo\r\nboat, for none represent such concentrated pent-up energy and deadly\r\neffect as this little demon of the sea. A mere shell in construction,\r\nwith engine and boiler built for highest speed, and crew suffering\r\nuntold discomforts and dangers below, this modern engine of destruction,\r\nwith the speed of an express locomotive, and the helplessness and deadly\r\nintent of a scorpion, darts up to the monster battleship under cover of\r\ndarkness, and before being discovered discharges a torpedo and delivers\r\na mortal wound in the side of the big ship which sends her to the\r\nbottom, perishing perhaps itself in the destruction which it works. The\r\nUnited States has 37 of these torpedo boats. The torpedo boat destroyer\r\nis a larger and swifter boat, whose special duty it is to overtake and\r\ndestroy this dangerous little fighter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.--SHIPPING OF ALL NATIONS. RATIO OF STEAM TO\r\nSAILS.]\r\n\r\nThe growth of steam navigation during the present generation has been\r\nwonderfully rapid. The accompanying diagram, Fig. 121, from Mulhall’s\r\n“Industries and Wealth of Nations,” shows in 1860 30 per cent. of steam\r\nto 70 per cent. of sailing vessels, while in 1894 the ratio is 80 per\r\ncent. of steam to 20 of sailing vessels. The same authority estimated\r\nthe total horse power of steam vessels in the merchant marine of the\r\nworld in 1895 to be 12,005,000. Add to this the growth of the past five\r\nyears, and about 4,000,000 horse power for the steam war vessels of the\r\nworld’s navies, which were not included, and the total horse power of\r\nthe steam vessels of the world would not be far from twenty million.\r\n\r\nThis cursory review, in a single chapter, cannot adequately treat this\r\ngreat subject, for a whole library is needed to cover the field. Suffice\r\nit to say, however, that among the great scenes and acts in the theatre\r\nof human action, no figure has occupied so much attention, and none\r\nplayed so important a part in the drama of life, as the steam vessel.\r\nIts stage setting has been the majestic waters of the earth, and on it\r\nthe play of the great warships has vied in power and grandeur with the\r\nflash and vehemence of the lightning, and the whirl and turmoil of the\r\nelements. Tense with a deep meaning which no stage simulation could\r\napproximate, and with the smoke of conflict for a drop curtain, it has\r\nlaid tragedies upon the pages of history, and changed the maps of the\r\nworld; while behind the scenes the great passenger steamers, with their\r\nuninterrupted traffic of human freight, are more silently, but none the\r\nless surely, stirring the peoples of the earth into the homogeneous\r\nferment of civilization, and slowly moulding nations into the solidarity\r\nof a common brotherhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nPRINTING.\r\n\r\n    EARLY PRINTING PRESSES--NICHOLSON’S ROTARY PRESS--THE COLUMBIAN AND\r\n    WASHINGTON PRESSES--KÖNIG ROTARY STEAM PRESS--THE HOE TYPE REVOLVING\r\n    MACHINE--COLOR PRINTING--STEREOTYPING--PAPER MAKING--WOOD PULP--THE\r\n    LINOTYPE--PLATE PRINTING--LITHOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe art preservative of all arts it has been rightfully called. Before\r\nits birth generation after generation of the human family lived and\r\ndied, and each was but little wiser, and but little better than its\r\npredecessor. Tradition was the misty, vague, and sometimes wholly false\r\ndependence of the living, and the experiences of mankind were, in the\r\nwords of an eminent writer, but like the stern lights of a vessel, which\r\nonly illumined the pathway over which each had passed. But printing\r\ngives to the present the cumulative wisdom of the past, and marks a\r\ngreat era of growth in civilization. It conserves and preserves man’s\r\nthoughts and makes them immortal, so that each generation comes into\r\nexistence with a richer legacy of ideas, and is guaranteed a higher\r\nplane of existence, and a more exalted destiny.\r\n\r\nPrinting from letters engraved on blocks of wood is an ancient art,\r\nhaving had its origin in China many centuries before the Christian era.\r\nThe Chinese method, which is still followed, was to write their\r\ncharacters with a brush on a sheet of paper, and while still wet, the\r\npiece of paper was laid face downward on a smooth piece of board to\r\ntransfer the ink lines, and then all except the ink lines on the board\r\nwas cut away. Thus they have one type plate for each book page. Printing\r\nwith movable type, _i. e._, with a separate type for each letter, which\r\nmay be repeatedly set up into forms of varying composition, is\r\npractically the beginning of the modern art of printing. This invention\r\nis usually ascribed to Johann Gutenberg, of Mentz, about 1436.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122.--BENJAMIN FRANKLIN’S PRESS, 1725.]\r\n\r\nIn the earliest printing presses the form was locked up in a tray, and\r\nplaced upon a platform, and the platen was then brought down upon it by\r\nturning a screw in a cross bar above. The first printing press of this\r\ntype was made by Blaew, of Amsterdam, in 1620, which had a spring to\r\ncause the screw to fly back after the impression was taken. The press\r\nupon which Benjamin Franklin worked in London in 1725 is of this\r\npattern, and is to be seen in the National Museum at Washington. It is\r\nalmost entirely of wood, and is shown in Fig. 122. About the beginning\r\nof the Nineteenth Century Lord Stanhope invented a press entirely of\r\ncast iron, in which the oscillating handle operated a toggle to force\r\ndown the platen in taking the impression. The bed traveled on guide\r\nways, and the tympan and frisket were hinged to fold back and lay in\r\nelevated position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.--THE WASHINGTON PRESS.]\r\n\r\nThe “Columbian” press was the first important American improvement. It\r\nwas invented by George Clymer, of Philadelphia, and is shown in his\r\nBritish Pat. No. 4,174 of 1817. A compound lever was employed for\r\napplying the power. The “Washington” press was patented in the United\r\nStates by Samuel Rust, April 17, 1829. In this press (see Fig. 123) the\r\nplaten is forced downwardly by a compound lever applied to a toggle\r\njoint and is raised by springs on each side. The bed is run in and out\r\nby turning a crank on a shaft which has a pulley and belt passing around\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAs so far described the presses were worked by hand power. An important\r\nstep in the advancement of this art was made by the introduction of\r\n_power presses_ worked by steam. These arranged the type on the surface\r\nof a cylinder. Probably the earliest form of rotary cylinder press is\r\nthat invented by Nicholson, British Pat. No. 1,748 of 1790. Its main\r\nfeatures are described as follows: “The types, being rubbed or scraped\r\nnarrower toward the foot, were to be fixed radially upon a cylinder.\r\nThis cylinder with its type was to revolve in gear with another cylinder\r\ncovered with soft leather (the impression cylinder), and the type\r\nreceived its ink from another cylinder, to which the inking apparatus\r\nwas applied. The paper was impressed by passing between the type and the\r\nimpression cylinder.”\r\n\r\nThe first practical success, however, in rotary steam presses was\r\nachieved by König, a German, who in 1814 set up for the _London Times_\r\ntwo machines, by which that newspaper was printed at the rate of 1,100\r\nimpressions per hour. He obtained British Pat. No. 3,321 of 1810, No.\r\n3,496 of 1811, No. 3,725 of 1813, and No. 3,868 of 1814. König’s machine\r\nwas in 1827 succeeded by that of Applegath and Cowper, which was simpler\r\nand more rapid.\r\n\r\nMany improvements upon the methods for handling the paper were\r\nsubsequently devised, and double cylinder presses were made which were\r\nable to print 4,000 sheets an hour. In 1845 the firm of R. Hoe & Co.,\r\nwhich had already been for years engaged in the manufacture of printing\r\npresses, brought out the Hoe Type Revolving Machine. The first one of\r\nthese was placed in the office of the _Philadelphia Ledger_ in 1846, and\r\nhad four impression cylinders, printing 8,000 papers per hour. The\r\nconstantly increasing circulation of newspapers, however, continued to\r\nmake insatiable demands for more rapid work, and to meet this demand the\r\nHoe company in 1871 brought out their continuous web press, in which the\r\npaper was furnished to the machine in the form of a roll, and after\r\nbeing printed was separated into sheets. This principle of action gave\r\npromise of unlimited speed, and required important reorganization in all\r\nparts of the machine. To meet these conditions of increased speed more\r\nrapid drying ink had to be produced to prevent blurring, paper of\r\nuniform quality and strength had to be made, means had to be devised for\r\nprinting the opposite side of the web, and severing devices for cutting\r\nthe web into sheets were needed, but perhaps the most important feature\r\nwas the device called a gathering and delivering cylinder, whereby the\r\npapers could be gathered and disposed of as fast as they could be\r\nprinted, and much faster than human hands could work. This was the\r\ninvention of Stephen D. Tucker, and it is the mechanism upon which the\r\nspeed of the modern press depends, for it would obviously be useless to\r\nprint papers faster than they could be taken from the machine in proper\r\ncondition. Many patents were taken by Messrs. Hoe & Tucker covering\r\nvarious improvements, prominent among which were No. 18,640, Nov. 17,\r\n1857; No. 25,199, Aug. 23, 1859 (re-issue No. 4,429); No. 84,627, Dec.\r\n1, 1868 (re-issue No. 4,400); No. 113,769, April 18, 1871; No. 124,460,\r\nMarch 12, 1872; No. 131,217, Sept. 10, 1872. The first rapid printing\r\npress of the Hoe Company was set up in the office of the _New York\r\nTribune_ in 1871, and its maximum output was 18,000 an hour. This marked\r\nthe great era of rapid newspaper printing, and following it many further\r\nimprovements, such as devices for folding and counting the papers\r\nautomatically, have been added, until to-day the great Hoe Octuple\r\nPress, shown in Fig. 124, is the wonder of the Nineteenth Century. It\r\nprints 96,000 papers of four, six, or eight pages in an hour, or at the\r\nrate of 1,600 a minute, and these papers are not only printed, but in\r\nthe same operation and by the same machine are cut, pasted, folded, and\r\ncounted automatically. Fifty miles of paper of the width of an ordinary\r\nnewspaper pass through it each hour from its several rolls. The machine\r\nweighs over 60 tons, and is composed of about 16,000 parts, and yet its\r\ntouch is so deft, and its members so delicately and accurately adjusted\r\nthat it does not tear the tender sheet as it flies through the\r\nmachine--so fast that one-fifth of a second only is required to print a\r\npage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124.--HOE OCTUPLE PRESS. PRINTS, CUTS, PASTES, FOLDS\r\nAND COUNTS NEWSPAPERS AT RATE OF 1,600 A MINUTE.]\r\n\r\nThe latest development in the printing press has been in color printing,\r\nwhich has recently been introduced in the illustration of some of the\r\nlargest daily newspapers. Such a press contains from 50,000 to 60,000\r\nparts, and its cost is from $35,000 to $45,000.\r\n\r\nCollateral with the development of the printing press are three\r\nimportant branches of the art--stereotyping, paper making, and type\r\nsetting.\r\n\r\n_Stereotyping_ was the invention of William Ged, of Edinburgh, in 1731,\r\nand was introduced into the United States by David Bruce, of New York,\r\nin 1813. The stereotype is simply a moulded duplicate of the type face\r\nas set up, the duplicate being cast in the form of a single block of\r\nmetal, by first taking an impression in plastic material from the faces\r\nof the type, after being set up, to form the mould, and then casting, in\r\nan easily fusible metal, an exact duplicate of this type face in this\r\nmould. This art prevents the wear on the movable type involved in\r\nprinting, and also avoids the locking up into permanent forms of a large\r\nbody of valuable type, since a form may be set up, stereotyped, and the\r\ntype then distributed and set up into another form. Stereotyping,\r\nalthough used in book printing, was not thought practical for newspaper\r\nwork until about 1861, because of the length of time required for the\r\nformation and drying of the mould and the casting of the plate; but\r\nabout this time great expedition in the formation of the plate was\r\nattained by the employment of a steam bed to dry the mould, and a novel\r\nform of papier maché matrix, or mould, which could be conveniently\r\ndisposed around the cylinders of type. The dampened and plastic papier\r\nmaché sheets are beaten into the face of the type form by means of\r\nbrushes, are then removed, dried, and used as moulds to cast the\r\nstereotype plate from. A stereotype plate can now be made in about seven\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 125.--PAPER PULP BEATING ENGINE.]\r\n\r\n_Paper Making_ is an important adjunct of the printing art, and its\r\nformation cheaply into long rolls of uniform strength is an essential\r\ncondition of success in the rapid web-perfecting printing press. A\r\nFrenchman named Louis Robert about 1799 was the first to make a\r\ncontinuous web of paper, and in 1800 he received from the French\r\nGovernment a reward of 8,000 francs for his discovery. His invention was\r\nsubsequently taken up and carried to a success by the great English\r\npaper makers, the Fourdrinier Brothers, whose name has been given to the\r\nmachine. In the Fourdrinier process rags are ground to a pulp by a\r\nrevolving beater (Fig. 125) working in a tank of water. The pulp, duly\r\nbeaten, refined, screened, and diluted with water, is then piped into\r\nthe “flow-box” of the Fourdrinier machine. The “flow-box,” shown on\r\nright of Fig. 126, is a deep rectangular chamber extending across the\r\nfull width of the machine, from which the pulp flows out in a thin\r\nstream onto an endless belt of 70-mesh wire cloth which runs over end\r\nrollers. To prevent the stream of pulp from flowing laterally over the\r\nedges of the belt, two endless rubber guides or bands, two inches square\r\nin cross section, travel with the belt over the first twenty feet of its\r\nlength, and run over two pulleys above the wire cloth. The upper half of\r\nthe wire cloth belt is supported by and runs over a series of closely\r\njuxtaposed rollers. As the pulp passes from the “flow-box” the particles\r\nof fibre float in it just as an innumerable multitude of particles of\r\ncotton fibre would float in a stream of water. To unite and interlace\r\nthe fibres the wire cloth belt is given a lateral oscillating or shaking\r\nmovement, which serves to interlock the fibres. Meanwhile the water\r\nstrains through the wire cloth, leaving a thin layer of moist interlaced\r\nfibre spread in a white sheet over the surface of the belt. The\r\nseparation of the water is further assisted by suction boxes which\r\nextend across close beneath the upper run of the belt and are connected\r\nto suction pumps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126.--FOURDRINIER PAPER MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nThe wire cloth with its layer of moist pulp now passes below a roll\r\nwhich compresses the fibre, and then leaving the machine seen in Fig.\r\n126 it passes below a second and larger roll covered with felt, which\r\npresses out more of the water. The fibre next passes to the “first\r\npress,” where it is caught up on an endless belt and passed between two\r\nrollers where more water is pressed out of the sheet. Then it passes\r\nthrough a “second press,” and finally the sheet commences a long journey\r\nup and down over a series of steam-heated drying rolls, by which the\r\nsheet is dried.\r\n\r\n_Wood-Pulp._--When a purchaser of one of the New York dailies reads the\r\nmorning’s voluminous edition, he little realizes that he holds in his\r\nhands the remains of a billet of wood as large as a good-sized club, yet\r\nsuch is the case. Originally made from the fibres of the papyrus plant,\r\nand later from rags beaten into a pulp, paper for the printing of books\r\nand newspapers is now made almost entirely of wood. In the formation of\r\npaper pulp from wood two processes are employed, one known as the soda\r\nprocess, and the other the sulphite process. In both cases the wood is\r\ncut into fine chips, and then digested in great drums with chemicals to\r\nextract the resinous matter and leave the pure fibrous cellulose, which\r\nresembles raw cotton in texture. This industry was developed by Watt and\r\nBurgess in 1853 (U. S. Pat. No. 11,343, July 18, 1854), who invented the\r\nsoda process; by Voelter (U. S. Pat. No. 21,161, Aug. 10, 1858), who\r\ndevised means for comminuting or shredding the wood; and by Tilghman (U.\r\nS. Pat. No. 70,485, Nov. 5, 1867), who invented the sulphite process.\r\n\r\nThe logs, usually of spruce or poplar, are first split, as seen at the\r\nbottom of Fig. 127, then placed in the chipper, where a revolving disc\r\nwith knives cuts them into small chips, which are fed to an elevator and\r\nraised to a screening device, seen at the top, to remove saw-dust, dirt\r\nand knots. In the sulphite process the chips are then delivered into the\r\ndigesters shown in Fig. 128, which are supplied with sulphurous acid\r\ngenerated in a plant shown in Fig. 129. In the digesters the gummy and\r\nresinous matters are dissolved by the heat and chemicals, and the woolly\r\nfibre left behind is bleached, washed, and dried, and afterwards made\r\ninto paper upon the Fourdrinier machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127.--CHIPPING LOGS FOR PAPER PULP.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.--DIGESTER FOR WOOD PULP.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129.--SULPHUROUS ACID PLANT FOR MAKING WOOD PULP.]\r\n\r\nIt was stated by the _Paper Trade Journal_ in 1897 that the increase in\r\npaper making in the United States during the 15 years preceding amounted\r\nto 352 per cent., due chiefly to the growth of the wood pulp industry.\r\nThe Androscoggin Pulp Mill, established in Maine in 1870, was one of the\r\npioneers in this field. In that State the industry had grown in 1897 to\r\nover $13,000,000 and gave employment to more than 5,000 men, but the\r\nState of Maine is excelled by both New York and Wisconsin in this\r\nindustry, for in the same year New York mills had a daily capacity of\r\n1,800,000 pounds; Wisconsin, 670,000; Maine, 665,000, and other States a\r\nless capacity. There are over 1,000 paper mills in the United States,\r\nand their combined daily capacity amounts to over 13,000 tons. In 1898\r\nthe United States exported over five million dollars’ worth of paper,\r\nand over fifty million pounds of wood pulp. Of the total amount of paper\r\nproduced in the world Mulhall estimated it in 1890 to be 2,620,000,000\r\ntons annually. This amount is greatly increased at the present time, and\r\nby far the larger part of it is manufactured from wood.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 the _Philadelphia Record_ in an experimental test as to speed,\r\ncut trees from the forest, converted them into paper, and then into\r\nprinted newspapers, all within the space of 22 hours. At a later period\r\nin Germany, where the wood pulp art began, even this expeditious work\r\nhas been excelled. The trees were felled in the morning at 7:35,\r\nconverted into paper, and presented at 10 A. M. in the form of printed\r\nnewspapers, with a record of the news of the forenoon. The great naval\r\nedition of the _Scientific American_ of April 30, 1898, consumed a\r\nhundred tons of wood pulp paper, and was therefore built upon a material\r\nfoundation of 125 cords of wood, which cleared off over six acres of\r\nwell-set spruce timber land. It is mainly wood pulp that has enabled\r\nbooks and newspapers to be made so cheaply, for they are now furnished\r\nat a less price than the cost of the paper made in the old way from\r\nrags.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 130.--LINOTYPE MACHINE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131.--LINOTYPE MATRIX.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 132.--SPACING OF ASSEMBLED LINE OF MATRICES.]\r\n\r\n_The Linotype._--The most revolutionary and perhaps the most important\r\ndevelopment in the printing art of this century has been the linotype\r\nmachine. The laborious, painstaking, and expensive feature of printing\r\nhas always been the setting and redistribution of the types, since each\r\nlittle piece had to be separately selected and placed in the composing\r\nstick, and the line afterwards “justified,” which means an apportionment\r\nof the space between the words so as to make each line of type about the\r\nsame length in the column. The same separate handling of each piece was\r\nagain involved in restoring the type to the case. Machines for thus\r\nsetting and distributing the type had been devised, but the operation\r\nwas so involved, and required so nearly the discretion of the thinking\r\nmind, that all automatic machinery proved too complicated and\r\nimpracticable. In 1886, however, a machine was placed in the office of\r\nthe _New York Tribune_ whose performances astonished and alarmed the\r\nold-time compositor. It rendered it unnecessary to handle the type, or\r\neven to have any separate type at all. It was the Mergenthaler Linotype\r\nmachine, which automatically formed its own type by casting a whole line\r\nof it at a time. The first machine was invented in 1884, and patented in\r\n1885, but it was subsequently reorganized and greatly improved in Pats.\r\nNo. 425,140, April 8, 1890; Nos. 436,531 and 436,532, Sept. 16, 1890,\r\nand No. 438,354, Oct. 14, 1890. It is shown in the accompanying\r\nillustration (Fig. 130). By manipulating the keyboard, which resembles\r\nthat of a typewriter, each lettered key is made to bring down from an\r\ninclined elevated magazine a little brass plate of the shape shown in\r\nFig. 131, and which plate is called a matrix, because it bears on its\r\nedge at _x_ a mould of the type letter. There is a matrix plate for\r\nevery letter and character used. These little matrices are spaced by\r\nwedges, as seen in Fig. 132, and are assembled, as in Fig. 133, along\r\nthe side of a mould wheel having a slot in it which forms a channel\r\nbetween the aligned type-moulds or matrices on one side and the\r\ndischarge mouth of a melting pot, in which molten type metal is\r\nmaintained in a fluid state by a subjacent gas-burner. In the melting\r\npot there is a cylinder and plunger, and when the plunger descends, it\r\nforces the molten metal up through the discharge spout into the slot of\r\nthe mould wheel, and against the letter mould _x_ of each one of the\r\ncomposed or aligned matrices. The wheel is then turned with the\r\nmatrices, and the metal in its slot is afterwards discharged in the form\r\nof a linotype slug, seen in Fig. 134, which is a metal plate bearing on\r\nits edge a completely moulded line of type ready for setting up in the\r\nform for printing. The jagged notches in the tops of the matrices (Fig.\r\n131) are for co-operation with a distributer bar (not easily explained)\r\nfor restoring the matrices to their appropriate magazines after being\r\nused. There are altogether about 1,500 of the little brass matrices. The\r\nmachine is about five feet square, weighs 1,750 pounds, and costs $3,000\r\neach. Notwithstanding this expense these Linotype machines have to-day\r\nmade their way into nearly all the daily newspaper offices of the\r\ncivilized world, even to Australia and the Hawaiian Islands. In the\r\ncomposing rooms of the daily newspapers and the larger book printing\r\noffices we find great rows of these Linotype machines, each doing the\r\nwork of from four to five men. There are now in use in America something\r\nover 5,000 Linotype machines; and in other countries about 2,000, making\r\n7,000 in all. Each machine may be adjusted in five minutes to produce\r\nany size or style of type, and it gives new, clean faces for each day’s\r\nissue, with none of the ordinary troubles of distributing type. The\r\ncheapness of composition, due to the machine, has led to an enormous\r\nincrease in the size of papers, in the frequency of the editions, and\r\nhas correspondingly increased the demand for labor in all the attendant\r\nlines, such as paper-making, press-making, the attendants on presses,\r\nstereotyping, etc. In the Boston Library, which keeps its catalogues\r\nprinted up to within 24 hours of date, the Linotypes print in 23\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 133.--CASTING THE LINE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 134.--A LINOTYPE.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Linotype machine was first patented it was not regarded by\r\nprinters generally as a practical machine, but only one of the many\r\ncomplicated, theoretical, but impracticable organizations which the\r\nPatent Office has to deal with. Its history, however, has been unique.\r\nIt is practically the product of the brain of a single man, Ottmar\r\nMergenthaler, a most ingenious and indefatigable inventor living in\r\nBaltimore. It was exploited under the powerful patronage of a syndicate\r\nof newspaper men, and hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent in\r\nperfecting it before any practical results were obtained. To-day it\r\nstands a triumph of human ingenuity, ranking in importance with the\r\nrotary web-perfecting press, and is probably the most ingenious piece of\r\npractical mechanism in existence.\r\n\r\nOf the three forms of printing attention has been given thus far only to\r\nthe leading branch of the art, which is _type printing_, or “_letter\r\npress_,” as it is called, in which the characters are raised in relief\r\nand receive ink on their raised surfaces only. A second branch of the\r\nart is _plate printing_, in which the lines and characters are engraved\r\nin intaglio in a plate, and which, being covered with ink, and the\r\nsurface of the plate wiped clean, leaves the ink in the undercuts, which\r\nis taken up by the paper when pressure is applied through a roller.\r\nPlate printing is a very old art, the plate printing press having been\r\nascribed to Tomasso Finiguerra, of Florence, in 1460. The reciprocating\r\ntable bearing the engraved plate, and the superposed pressure roller\r\nturned by hand through its long radial arms, is an ancient and familiar\r\nform of press which has been in use for many years. This method of\r\nprinting finds application in fine line engraving in works of art, card\r\ninvitations, and bank note engraving. Very ingenious automatic machines\r\nhave been invented and were in use a few years ago by the United States\r\nGovernment for printing its bank notes, but have since been displaced by\r\nthe old hand machines. To the credit of the machine, it should be said,\r\nthat it was from no fault in the machine that this retrograde step was\r\ntaken, but rather the disfavor of the labor organizations.\r\n\r\n_Lithography_ is another and quite important branch of the printing art,\r\nin which the lines and characters are drawn upon stone with a kind of\r\noily ink to which printers’ ink will adhere, while it is repelled from\r\nthe other moistened surfaces of the stone. Lithography was invented in\r\n1798 by Alois Senefelder, of Munich. It finds its greatest application\r\nin artistic and fanciful work in inks of various colors, and its\r\ndevelopment into chromo-lithography in the Nineteenth Century has grown\r\ninto a fine art. Our beautifully colored chromos, prints, labels, maps,\r\netc., are made by this process. A more recent and quite important\r\ndevelopment of this art is photo-lithography, which will be more fully\r\nconsidered under photography.\r\n\r\nMany collateral branches of the printing art are interesting in their\r\ndevelopment, such as calico printing, the printing of wall papers, of\r\noil cloth, printing for the blind, book binding, type founding, and\r\nfolding and addressing machines, but lack of space forbids more than a\r\ncasual mention.\r\n\r\nPrinting is perhaps the greatest of all the arts of civilization, and\r\nthe libraries and newspapers of the Nineteenth Century attest its value.\r\nIf Benjamin Franklin could wake from his long sleep and enter the\r\ncomposing rooms of our great dailies, and witness the imposing array of\r\nlinotype machines, more resembling a machine shop than a printing\r\noffice, and then visit the press room and see the avalanche of finished\r\npapers flying at the rate of 1,600 a minute, neatly folded, and counted\r\nfor delivery, he would doubtless be overwhelmed with emotions of wonder\r\nand incredulity, for broad-minded man as he was, he could have no\r\nconception of such progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE TYPEWRITER.\r\n\r\n    OLD ENGLISH TYPEWRITER OF 1714--THE BURT TYPEWRITER OF 1829--\r\n    PROGIN’S FRENCH MACHINE OF 1833--THURBER’S PRINTING MACHINE OF\r\n    1843--THE BEACH TYPEWRITER--THE SHOLES TYPEWRITER, THE FIRST OF THE\r\n    MODERN FORM, COMMERCIALLY DEVELOPED INTO THE REMINGTON--THE\r\n    CALIGRAPH--SMITH-PREMIER--THE BOOK TYPEWRITER AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOccupying an intermediate place between the old-fashioned scribe and the\r\nprinter, the typewriter has in the latter part of the Nineteenth Century\r\nestablished a distinct and important avocation, and has become a\r\nnecessary factor in modern business life. Chirography, or hand writing,\r\nreflecting, as it did, the idiosyncrasies of each writer, was not only\r\nslow, but when employed was, in most cases, in the haste and press of\r\nactive business reduced to an illegible scrawl. For the use of reporters\r\nand others requiring extra speed, stenography, or short hand, was\r\nresorted to, but there was a distinct need for some easy, quick,\r\nlegible, and uniform record of the busy man’s correspondence and copy\r\nwork, and this the modern typewriter has supplied.\r\n\r\nLike most other important inventions, the typewriter did not spring into\r\nexistence all at once, for while the practical embodiment in really\r\nuseful machines has only taken place since about 1868, there had been\r\nmany experiments and some success attained at a much earlier date. The\r\nBritish patent to Henry Mills. No. 395 of 1714, is the earliest record\r\nof efforts in this direction. At this early date no drawings were\r\nattached to patents, and the specification dwells more on the function\r\nof the machine than the instrumentalities employed. No record of the\r\nconstruction of this machine remains in existence, and it may fairly be\r\nconsidered a lost art. In quaint and old-fashioned English, the patent\r\nspecification proceeds as follows:\r\n\r\n“_ANNE_, by the grace of God, &c., to all whom these presents shall\r\ncome, greeting: _WHEREAS_, our trusty and well-beloved subject, Henry\r\nMills, hath by his humble peticon represented vnto vs, that he has by\r\nhis greate study, paines, and expence, lately invented, and brought to\r\nperfection “_An Artificial Machine_ or _Method_ for the _Impressing_ or\r\n_Transcribing Letters Singly_ or _Progressively_ one after another as in\r\n_Writing_, whereby all _Writing whatever_ may be _Engrossed_ in _Paper_\r\nor _Parchment_ so _Neat_ and _Exact_ as not to be Distinguished from\r\n_Print_, that the said _Machine_ or Method, may be of greate vse in\r\n_Settlements_ and _Publick Recors_, the Impression being deeper and more\r\nLasting that any other _Writing_, and not to be erased, or\r\n_Counterfeited_ without _Manifest Discovery_, and having therefore\r\nhumbly prayed vs to grant him our Royall Letters Patents, for the sole\r\nvse of his said Invention for the term of fourteen yeares.”\r\n\r\n“_Know Yee_, that wee,” etc.\r\n\r\nThe first American typewriter of which any record remains is that\r\ndescribed in the patent granted to W. A. Burt, July 23, 1829. It was\r\ncalled a “Typographer.” It had a segment bearing the letters of the\r\nalphabet and corresponding notches acting as an index. A superposed\r\nlever, which could be worked up and down, and also moved laterally, was\r\nprovided with a series of type, arranged in a segmental curve, so that\r\nany type could be brought into place on the subjacent paper by swinging\r\nthe lever over to and down into the proper notch in the index segment\r\nbelow. A restored model of this is to be found in the U. S. Patent\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 135.--FRENCH TYPEWRITER, 1833.]\r\n\r\nThe first organized typewriter in which separate key levers were\r\nprovided for each type is a French invention. It is to be found in the\r\nFrench patent to M. Progin (Xavier), of Marseilles, No. 3,748, Sept. 6,\r\n1833 (Brevets d’Invention, Vol. 37, 1st Series, pl. 36). It was called a\r\nTypographic Machine, and is shown in the illustration (Fig. 135).\r\nUpright key levers _s_ are arranged in a circle around a circular plate\r\n_n_. They have hook-shaped handles at the upper end, and terminate\r\nbelow in forks that are pivoted to the shanks of type hammers, to raise\r\nand lower them. These hammers are inked from a pad, and at a central\r\npoint deliver a printing blow on the paper below. The paper is held\r\nstationary, and the whole nest of levers was moved over the paper for\r\neach letter printed. The circular index plate _n_ had marked on it\r\nopposite the respective levers the letters and characters represented by\r\nsaid levers. Besides printing letters, the device was to be used for\r\nprinting music, and for making stereotype plates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 136.--THURBER TYPEWRITER.]\r\n\r\nOn Aug. 26, 1843, Charles Thurber, of Worcester, Mass., took out Pat.\r\nNo. 3,228 for a Printing Machine. Under the patent he constructed the\r\nmachine shown in Fig. 136. This differed somewhat from the form shown in\r\nhis patent, in that the machine shows a paper feed roller which does not\r\nappear in the patent. This machine was found among the effects of Mr.\r\nThurber after having lain neglected and unnoticed for many years, and\r\nits damaged parts were restored by Mr. H. R. Cummings, of Worcester. The\r\ntypes are carried on the lower ends of a circular series of depressible\r\nbars, which are spring seated in a horizontal rotatable wheel. By\r\nturning the wheel any type can be brought to the front, and a stationary\r\nguide controls its descent as it makes the impression. An inking roller\r\nis seen on the right, which inks the faces of the type. In front of the\r\ntype wheel is a horizontal roller to which the sheet of paper is\r\nattached by clips. Finger pawls, working into ratchets at the ends of\r\nthe roller, serve to rotate it after each line is printed. By means of a\r\nhandle, seen projecting from the right hand side of the frame, the\r\nroller is shifted longitudinally on its axis rod after each letter has\r\nbeen printed. This appears to be the first embodiment of the feed roller\r\nrotating to bring a new line into range, and having also a longitudinal\r\nfeed, but as these movements were required to be separately executed by\r\nthe operator, the work of the machine was necessarily very slow. Just at\r\nwhat time this old Thurber machine was constructed it is impossible to\r\nstate in the light of present information, but as the feed roller did\r\nnot appear in Thurber’s patent of 1843, it is possible that the claim to\r\nauthorship of the feed roller having both a rotary and a longitudinal\r\nmovement may be maintained in behalf of J. Jones, whose Pat. No. 8,980\r\nof June 1, 1852, appears to be the first dated record of such a feed\r\nroller. Jones was also the first to provide a spring to automatically\r\nretract the paper carriage to the position for beginning a new line, the\r\nspring being put under tension by the movement of the paper carriage in\r\nprinting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 137.--BEACH TYPEWRITER.]\r\n\r\nProminent among those whose genius has served to perfect the typewriter\r\noccurs the name of A. E. Beach, for many years of the firm of Munn &\r\nCo., and well known to the readers of the _Scientific American_. Mr.\r\nBeach’s first model of a typewriter was made in 1847. It printed upon a\r\nsheet of paper supported on a roller, carried in a sliding frame worked\r\nby a ratchet and pawl. It had a weight for running the frame, letter and\r\nline spacing keys, paper feeding devices, line signal bell, and carbon\r\ntissue. It had a series of finger keys connected with printing levers\r\nwhich were arranged in a circle, and struck at a common center. This\r\nmachine was said to have worked well, but was laid aside for further\r\nimprovement. In the meantime he constructed a typewriter to print in\r\nraised letters, without ink. This machine, which was intended primarily\r\nfor the use of the blind, is illustrated in Figs. 137 and 138. It was\r\nfirst publicly exhibited in operation at the Crystal Palace Exhibition\r\nof the American Institute in the fall of 1856, where it attracted great\r\nattention and took the gold medal. The embossed letters were printed on\r\na ribbon of paper which ran centrally through the machine. The printing\r\nlevers were arranged in a circle in pairs, one riding on the top of the\r\nother. When the operator pressed a key, the two printing levers of each\r\npair answering to the letter key were brought together, the paper being\r\nbetween them. The printing type were at the extremities of the levers,\r\none lever having a raised letter, and its mate a sunken or intaglio\r\nletter, which, seizing the paper strip between them, like the jaws of a\r\npair of pincers, impressed therein an embossed letter. The patent for\r\nthis machine was granted June 24, 1856, No. 15,164, but the machine\r\nshowed a much higher degree of development than appeared in the patent.\r\nThis machine was the earliest representative of the circular basket of\r\nradially swinging type levers, combined with finger keys assembled in a\r\nkeyboard at one side, which is now an almost universal feature, and the\r\nsuggestion which it handed down to subsequent inventors has doubtless\r\ndone much to make the typewriter the practical machine that it is\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 138.--CENTRAL SECTION OF BEACH TYPEWRITER.]\r\n\r\nUp to the year 1868, however, typewriting machines were mere\r\nillustrations of sporadic genius occuring here and there as the pet\r\nhobby of some humanitarian seeking to help the blind, or supplement the\r\ndeficiencies of the tremulous fingers of the paralytic. It had not yet\r\ncome to be regarded as of any special use, nor had even the demand for\r\nsuch a device been forcibly felt, until the last quarter of the\r\nNineteenth Century began to accumulate its wonderful momentum of\r\nprogress and prosperity. The man whose genius finally brought forth a\r\npractical typewriter, and made a permanent place for it in the daily\r\nbusiness of the world, was C. Latham Sholes. As joint inventor with C.\r\nGlidden and S. W. Soule, all of Milwaukee, he took out patents No.\r\n79,265, of June 23, 1868, and No. 79,868, of July 14, 1868. These,\r\ntogether with Sholes’ Pat. No. 118,491, of Aug. 29, 1871, formed the\r\nworking basis of the first typewriters that went into office use. These\r\ntypewriters were first introduced to the general public under the\r\nmanagement of the original inventors (Sholes, Soule and Glidden) about\r\n1873, and at first used only capital letters. On Aug. 27, 1878, a\r\nfurther patent. No. 207,559, was granted to Sholes, and about this time,\r\nafter five years of uncertain and precarious business existence, the\r\nmachine was taken for manufacture to E. Remington & Sons, at Ilion, N.\r\nY. Since this time the well-known “Remington” has built up for itself a\r\nreputation and a commercial importance that has given it first place\r\namong typewriters. In the nine years from 1873 to 1882, it is said that\r\nless than 8,000 machines had been manufactured. In the year 1882\r\nWyckoff, Seamans & Benedict obtained control of the machine, and during\r\nthe fourteen years following it is said that nearly 200,000 “Remingtons”\r\nwere made and sold. It is said that 1,000 men are now employed in\r\nmaking this machine, and that the present output is about 800 machines a\r\nweek, despite the fact that it has a half dozen worthy competitors for\r\npublic favor. The modern Remington, seen in Fig. 139, is too well known\r\nto require special description. Besides the Sholes patents, it embodies\r\nthe improvements covered by patents to Clough & Jenne, No. 199,263, Jan.\r\n15, 1878; Jenne, No. 478,964, July 12, 1892, and No. 548,553, Oct. 22,\r\n1895, and also a patent to Brooks, No. 202,923, April 30, 1878, a\r\ncharacteristic feature of which latter is the location of both a capital\r\nand small letter on the same striking lever, and the shifting of the\r\npaper roller by a key to bring either the large or small letter into\r\nprinting range.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 139.--REMINGTON TYPEWRITER.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest rival of the Remington was the Caligraph, made by the\r\nAmerican Writing Machine Co. This well-known machine, introduced in the\r\ndecade of the eighties, was made under the patents of G. Y. N. Yost,\r\nMarch 18, 1884, No. 295,469; March 17, 1885, No. 313,973; and July 30,\r\n1889, No. 408,061. The most modern form of the Caligraph is known as the\r\n“New Century,” which is shown in the accompanying illustration, Fig.\r\n140. The Caligraph uses a separate type lever and key for each letter,\r\nand by a system of compound key levers the touch is rendered easy, even,\r\nand elastic, and perfect alignment and freedom from noise are among the\r\nobjects sought in its mechanical construction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 140.--NEW CENTURY CALIGRAPH.]\r\n\r\nNext among the earlier typewriters is to be mentioned the “Hammond,”\r\nmade under the patents to J. B. Hammond, No. 224,088, Feb. 8, 1880, and\r\n290,419, Dec. 18, 1883. A distinguishing feature of the machine is that\r\nthe printed work is in full view, so that the operator can see what he\r\nis doing. The impression is made by an oscillating type wheel, to which\r\na variable throw is imparted by the key letters to bring any desired\r\nletter into printing position. When the letter is brought into printing\r\nposition a hammer, arranged in the rear of the sheet of paper, is made\r\nto force the latter against the type to produce the impression by the\r\nsame movement of the key that brought the type wheel into printing\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 141.--SMITH-PREMIER TYPE BAR RING.]\r\n\r\nOf later machines, none has met with more popular favor than the\r\nSmith-Premier, manufactured under the patent to A. T. Brown, No.\r\n465,451, Dec. 22, 1891, and others. A leading feature of this is the\r\ntype-bar ring of its printing mechanism. In all typewriters accurate\r\nlocation of the impression is essential to proper alignment of the\r\nletters, and proper alignment is the _sine qua non_ of typewriting. The\r\nold pivoted type bars were liable to wear at the joint, and the\r\nslightest looseness at this point would so multiply the lateral play at\r\nthe end carrying the type that the letters would soon become irregularly\r\nplaced and out of alignment. In the Smith-Premier this is reduced to a\r\nminimum by making a short type bar, and arranging each upon an\r\noscillating rock shaft, the bearings at whose ends are so widely\r\nseparated as to permit little or no lateral play in the type bar. A view\r\nof this type bar ring with tangentially arranged rock shafts disposed in\r\ncircular series is seen in Fig. 141, while the full machine is given in\r\nFig. 142. In this latter view there is also shown the cleaning brush for\r\nquickly cleaning at one operation all of the types of the outer ring. It\r\nis simply a circular brush mounted upon the end of a tool resembling a\r\ncarpenter’s brace, and is a useful and convenient adjunct to the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 142.--SMITH-PREMIER AND CLEANING BRUSH.]\r\n\r\nIn 1891 the “Densmore” typewriter first made its appearance before the\r\npublic. It was named after James and Amos Densmore, who had been\r\nconnected with typewriting interests from the time of Sholes’ first\r\npractical machine. The Densmore is made under patents to A. Densmore,\r\nNo. 507,726 and 507,727, of Oct. 31, 1893. It has ball-bearing type bar\r\njoints, giving accurate alignment and light key action, the platen rolls\r\nto show the work, and the carriage locks at the end of the line,\r\nprotecting the writing.\r\n\r\nNoted for its clear, sharp print, the “Yost” typewriter comes in for its\r\nshare of praise. It is made under the patent to Felbel and Steiger,\r\nMarch 26, 1889, No. 400,200. It does not employ an inked ribbon\r\ninterposed between the type and the paper, as do most typewriters, but\r\nits type-bearing levers, when at rest, occupy a position in which the\r\ntype are all arranged within and bear against a circular inking ring or\r\npad, and when a key is struck, its lever, by a peculiar and ingenious\r\nmovement, leaves the inking pad, moves inward and backward toward the\r\ncenter, and then rises and strikes an upwardly directed blow in the\r\ncenter, and prints the letter on the paper. As the printing is done\r\ndirectly from the type, the letters are formed with sharp and clear\r\noutlines that give beauty and neatness to the print. Alignment is\r\ninsured by a center guide hole through which the type end of the lever\r\npasses in striking the paper.\r\n\r\nAmong machines of simple organization may be mentioned the\r\nBlickensderfer, which is a wonderfully simple and effective little\r\nmachine, first made under the patent to Blickensderfer, No. 472,692,\r\nApril 12, 1892. Like the Hammond, it belongs to the class of typewriters\r\nwhich employ a rotary type wheel, which is given a variable throw, from\r\nthe depression of the keys, to bring the proper letter into printing\r\nposition; but unlike the Hammond, its type wheel advances to contact\r\nwith the paper, a little felt ink-roller being brought into contact with\r\nthe type wheel to ink it as the latter moves. The printed work is in\r\nfull view, the line spacing may be varied to any fractional adjustment,\r\nand the action is quite free from noise. With its mechanism reduced to\r\nthe fewest and simplest parts, the whole machine weighs only six pounds,\r\nand it differs in many respects from the ordinary typewriter. Since its\r\nintroduction a few years ago, its growth in popularity has been very\r\nrapid.\r\n\r\nAnother recently appearing machine is the “Oliver.” This has type bars\r\nwhich are normally above the work. Each bar is loop shaped, hinged at\r\nits lower ends, and bearing the type letter on the bend at the upper\r\nend. They are arranged in two series, one on each side of the center,\r\nand in printing each loop swings down like the wing of a bird. As the\r\nprinting is from the top, and the ribbon is moved away from in front of\r\nthe line immediately after the printing blow, the writing is always\r\nvisible to the operator. This machine is manufactured under various\r\npatents to Thomas Oliver, the first of which was No. 450,107, granted\r\nApril 7, 1891. Further improvements are covered by subsequent patents,\r\nNos. 528,484, 542,275, 562,337, and 599,863. The Oliver has made many\r\nfriends for itself by its fine alignment and visible writing, and shares\r\nwith the other standard machines a considerable patronage.\r\n\r\nIt is not practicable to give a full illustration of the state of the\r\nart in typewriters, as it has grown to an industry of large proportions.\r\nNearly 1,700 patents have been granted for such machines, and more than\r\n100 useful and meritorious machines have been devised and put upon the\r\nmarket. Among these may be mentioned the Hall, Underwood, Manhattan,\r\nWilliams, Jewett, and many others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 143.--ELLIOTT & HATCH BOOK TYPEWRITER.]\r\n\r\nBesides the regular typewriters, various modifications have been made to\r\nsuit special kinds of work. The “Comptometer” used in banks is a species\r\nof typewriter, as is also the Dudley adding and subtracting machine,\r\nknown as the “Numerograph,” and covered by patents Nos. 554,993,\r\n555,038, 555,039, 579,047 and 579,048. Typewriters for short hand\r\ncharacters, and for foreign languages, and for printing on record and\r\nblank books, are also among the modern developments of this art. In the\r\nlatter the whole carriage and system of type levers move over the book.\r\nThe Elliott & Hatch book typewriter, Fig. 143, is a well-known example.\r\nIn attachments, holders for the copy have received considerable\r\nattention, and simple and practical billing and tabulating attachments\r\nhave been devised which expedite and facilitate the statements of\r\naccounts and other work requiring numeration in columns. The Gorin\r\nTabulator is one of those in practical use.\r\n\r\nIn point of speed the typewriter depends entirely upon the aptness of\r\nthe operator. For ordinary copying work, where much time is occupied in\r\ndeciphering the illegible scrawl, probably forty words a minute is the\r\naverage work. When taken from dictation, seventy-five words a minute may\r\nbe written, and in special cases, when copying from memory, a speed of\r\n150 words a minute has been maintained for a limited time. It was\r\nestimated that there were in use in the United States in 1896 150,000\r\ntypewriters, and that up to that time 450,000 had been made altogether.\r\nIn the last four years this number has been greatly increased, and a\r\nfair estimate of the present output in the United States is between\r\n75,000 and 100,000 yearly. In 1898 there were exported from the United\r\nStates typewriting machines to the value of $1,902,153.\r\n\r\nThe typewriter has not only revolutionized modern business methods, by\r\nfurnishing a quick and legible copy that may be rapidly taken from\r\ndictation, and also at the same time a duplicate carbon copy for the use\r\nof the writer, but it has established a distinct avocation especially\r\nadapted to the deftness and skill of women, who as bread winners at the\r\nend of the Nineteenth Century are working out a destiny and place in the\r\nbusiness activities of life unthought of a hundred years ago. The\r\ntypewriter saves time, labor, postage and paper; it reduces the\r\nliability to mistakes, brings system into official correspondence, and\r\ndelights the heart of the printer. It furnishes profitable amusement to\r\nthe young, and satisfactory aid to the nervous and paralytic. All over\r\nthe world it has already traveled--from the counting house of the\r\nmerchant to the Imperial Courts of Europe, from the home of the new\r\nwoman in the Western Hemisphere to the harem of the East--everywhere its\r\nfamiliar click is to be heard, faithfully translating thought into all\r\nlanguages, and for all peoples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE SEWING MACHINE.\r\n\r\n    EMBROIDERING MACHINE, THE FORERUNNER OF THE SEWING MACHINE--SEWING\r\n    MACHINE OF THOMAS SAINT--THE THIMONNIER WOODEN MACHINE--GREENOUGH’S\r\n    DOUBLE POINTED NEEDLE--BEAN’S STATIONARY NEEDLE--THE HOWE SEWING\r\n    MACHINE--BACHELDER’S CONTINUOUS FEED--IMPROVEMENTS OF SINGER--\r\n    WILSON’S ROTARY HOOK AND FOUR-MOTION FEED--THE MCKAY SHOE SEWING\r\n    MACHINE--BUTTONHOLE MACHINES--CARPET SEWING MACHINE--STATISTICS.\r\n\r\n    “With fingers weary and worn,\r\n    With eyelids heavy and red,\r\n    A woman sat in unwomanly rags,\r\n    Plying her needle and thread--\r\n    Stitch! Stitch! Stitch!\r\n    In poverty, hunger and dirt,\r\n    And still with a voice of dolorous pitch,\r\n    She sang the ‘Song of the Shirt.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1844 Thomas Hood wrote and published his famous “Song of the Shirt,”\r\nin which the drudgery of the needle is portrayed with pathetic fidelity.\r\nIt is not to be supposed that any relation of cause and effect exists\r\nbetween the events, but it is nevertheless a singular fact that about\r\nthis time Howe commenced work on his great invention, which was patented\r\nin 1846, and was the prototype of the modern sewing machine. If the\r\nsewing machine had appeared a few years earlier, the “Song of the Shirt”\r\nwould doubtless never have been written.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Mother Eve, who crudely stitched together her fig\r\nleaves, sewing seems to have been set apart as an occupation peculiarly\r\nbelonging to women, and it may be that this was the reason why in the\r\nhistory of mechanical progress the sewing machine was so late appearing,\r\nfor women are not, as a rule, inventors, and none of the sewing machines\r\nwere invented by women.\r\n\r\nIn all the preceding centuries of civilization hand sewing was\r\nexclusively employed, and it was reserved for the Nineteenth Century to\r\nrelieve women from the drudgery which for so many centuries had enslaved\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nEmbroidery machines had been patented in England by Weisenthal in 1755,\r\nand Alsop in 1770, and on July 17, 1790, an English patent, No. 1,764,\r\nwas granted to Thomas Saint for a crude form of sewing machine, having a\r\nhorizontal arm and vertical needle. In 1826 a patent was granted in the\r\nUnited States to one Lye for a sewing machine, but no records of the\r\nsame remain, as all were burned in the fire of 1836. In 1830 B.\r\nThimonnier patented a sewing machine in France, 80 of which, made of\r\nwood, were in use in 1841 for sewing army clothing, but they were\r\ndestroyed by a mob, as many other labor-saving inventions had been\r\nbefore. Between 1832 and 1835 Walter Hunt, of New York, made a\r\nlock-stitch sewing machine, but abandoned it. On Feb. 21, 1842, U. S.\r\nPat. No. 2,466 was granted to J. J. Greenough for a sewing machine\r\nhaving a double pointed needle with an eye in the middle, which needle\r\nwas drawn through the work by pairs of traveling pincers. It was\r\ndesigned for sewing leather, and an awl pierced the hole in advance of\r\nthe needle. On March 4, 1843, U. S. Pat. No. 2,982 was granted to B. W.\r\nBean for a sewing machine in which the needle was stationary, and the\r\ncloth was gathered in crimps or folds and forced over the stationary\r\nneedle. In 1844, British Pat. No. 10,424 was granted to Fisher and\r\nGibbons for working ornamental designs by machinery, in which two\r\nthreads were looped together, one passing through the fabric, and the\r\nother looping with it on the surface without passing through.\r\n\r\nThe great epoch of the sewing machine, however, begins with Elias Howe\r\nand the sewing machine patented by him Sept. 10, 1846, No. 4,750. Almost\r\neveryone is familiar with the modern Howe sewing machine, and it will be\r\ntherefore more interesting to present the form in which it originally\r\nappeared. This is shown in Fig. 144. A curved eye-pointed needle was\r\ncarried at the end of a pendent vibrating lever, which had a motion\r\nsimulating that of a pick-ax in the hands of a workman. The needle took\r\nits thread from a spool situated above the lever, and the tension on the\r\nthread was produced by a spring brake whose semicircular end bore upon\r\nthe spool, the pressure being regulated by a vertical thumb screw. The\r\nwork was held in a vertical plane by means of a horizontal row of pins\r\nprojecting from the edge of a thin metal “baster plate,” to which an\r\nintermittent motion was given by the teeth of a pinion. Above, and to\r\none side of the “baster plate” was the shuttle race, through which the\r\nshuttle carrying the second thread was driven by two strikers, which\r\nwere operated by two arms and cams located on the horizontal main shaft.\r\nAs will be seen, this machine bears but little resemblance to any of the\r\nmodern machines, but it embodied the three essential features which\r\ncharacterize most all practical machines, viz.: a grooved needle with\r\nthe eye at the point, a shuttle operating on the opposite side of the\r\ncloth from the needle to form a lock stitch, and an automatic feed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 144.--HOWE’S SEWING MACHINE, 1846.]\r\n\r\nHowe first commenced his work on the sewing machine in 1844, and\r\nalthough he had made a rough model of that date, he was too poor to\r\nfollow it up with more practical results until a former schoolmate,\r\nGeorge Fisher, provided $500 to build a machine and support his family\r\nwhile it was being constructed, in consideration of which Mr. Fisher was\r\nto receive a half interest in the invention. In April, 1845, the machine\r\nwas completed, and in July he sewed two suits of clothes on it, one for\r\nMr. Fisher and the other for himself. Notwithstanding the success of\r\nhis machine, which on public exhibition beat five of the swiftest hand\r\nsewers, he met only discouragement and disappointment. He, however,\r\nbuilt a second machine, which was the basis of his patent, and is the\r\none shown in the illustration. After obtaining his United States patent\r\nHowe went to England with the hope of introducing his machine there,\r\nbut, failing, he returned to America, some years later, only to find\r\nthat his invention had been taken up by infringers, and that sewing\r\nmachines embodying his invention were being built and sold. These\r\ninfringers sought to break his patent by endeavoring to prove, but\r\nwithout success, that Howe’s invention was anticipated by the abandoned\r\nexperiments of Walter Hunt in 1834. Howe won his suit, and the\r\ninfringers were obliged to pay him royalties, which, for a time,\r\namounted to $25 on each machine. Howe then bought the outstanding\r\ninterest in his patent, established a factory in New York, and from the\r\nprofits of his manufacture, and the royalties, he soon reaped a princely\r\nfortune of several million dollars. In six years his royalties had grown\r\nfrom $300 to $200,000 a year, and in 1863 his royalties were estimated\r\nat $4,000 a day.\r\n\r\nA patent that occupied an important place in sewing machine feeds was\r\nthat granted to Bachelder May 8, 1849, No. 6,439, in which a spiked and\r\nendless belt passed horizontally around two pulleys. This patent\r\ncontained the first continuous feed, and it was re-issued and extended,\r\nand ran with dominating claims on the continuous feed, until 1877.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 145.--WILSON SEWING MACHINE, 1852.]\r\n\r\nIn connection with the development of the sewing machine the name of A.\r\nB. Wilson stands next in rank to that of Howe. Wilson invented the\r\nrotary hook carrying a bobbin, which took the place of the reciprocating\r\nshuttle. This was patented by him June 15, 1852, No. 9,041, and is shown\r\nin Fig. 145. He also invented the far more important improvement of the\r\nfour-motion feed, which is a characteristic feature of nearly all\r\npractical family sewing machines. This four-motion feed was pooled in\r\nthe early sewing machine combination with the Bachelder and other\r\npatents, and earned for its promotors a far greater pecuniary return\r\nthan the original Howe sewing machine itself. Estimates place this\r\nprofit high in the millions. The four-motion feed was patented December\r\n19, 1854, No. 12,116, and it is a comparatively simple affair. Divested\r\nof its operating mechanism, it consists simply of a little metal bar\r\nserrated with forwardly projecting saw teeth on its upper surface, to\r\nwhich bar, by means of an operating cam, a motion in four directions in\r\nthe path of a rectangle is given. The serrated bar first rises through a\r\nslot in the table, then moves horizontally to advance the cloth, then\r\ndrops below the table, and finally moves back again horizontally below\r\nthe table to its starting point.\r\n\r\nUpon these two important features--the rotating hook patented by Wilson\r\nin 1852, and the four-motion feed, patented in 1854--a large and\r\nimportant business was built. In this business Mr. Nathaniel Wheeler was\r\nassociated with Mr. Wilson, and the well-known Wheeler & Wilson machines\r\nare the result of their enterprise and ingenuity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 146.--ORIGINAL SINGER SEWING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nContemporaneous with the Wheeler & Wilson machine were other excellent\r\nmachines, among which may be mentioned the Singer machine, patented Aug.\r\n12, 1851, No. 8,294, by Isaac M. Singer, the original model of which is\r\nshown in Fig. 146. The Singer machine met the demands of the tailoring\r\nand leather industries for a heavier and more powerful machine. A\r\ncharacteristic feature was the vertical standard with horizontal arm\r\nabove the work table, which was afterwards adopted in many other\r\nmachines. Singer was the first to apply the treadle to the sewing\r\nmachine for actuating it by foot power in the place of the hand-driven\r\ncrank wheel. In 1851 W. O. Grover and W. E. Baker patented a machine\r\nwhich made the double chain stitch, characteristic of the Grover & Baker\r\nmachine. James E. A. Gibbs invented and covered in several patents from\r\n1856 to 1860 the single-thread rotating hook, which was embodied in the\r\nWilcox & Gibbs machine. In addition to these, the “Weed” machine, made\r\nunder Fairfield’s patents; the “Domestic” machine, made under Mack’s\r\npatents; and the “Florence” machine, made under Langdon’s patents, were\r\nother representative machines, which, in a few years after Howe’s\r\npatent, helped to revolutionize the art of tailoring, introduced the\r\ngreat era of ready-made clothing and ready-made shoes, emancipated women\r\nfrom the drudgery of the needle, and increased the efficiency of one\r\npair of hands fully ten fold.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 the owners of the original sewing machine patents formed the\r\nfamous “sewing machine combination,” for the establishment of a common\r\nlicense fee, and for the protection of their mutual interests. The\r\ncombination included Elias Howe, the Wheeler & Wilson Manufacturing\r\nCompany, the Grover & Baker Sewing Machine Company, and I. M. Singer &\r\nCo. The following summary of machines made by the leading companies from\r\n1853 to 1876 illustrates the early growth of this industry:\r\n\r\n  Manufacturer.         1853.   1859.   1867.    1871.    1873.    1876.\r\n\r\n  Wheeler & Wilson\r\n  Manufacturing Co.      799   21,306  38,055  128,526  119,190  108,997\r\n\r\n  The Singer\r\n  Manufacturing Company  810   10,953  43,053  181,260  232,444  262,316\r\n\r\n  Grover & Baker Sewing\r\n  Machine Co.            657   10,280  32,999   50,838   36,179     ....\r\n\r\n  Howe Sewing Machine\r\n  Company               ....     ....  11,053  134,010   90,000  109,294\r\n\r\n  Wilcox & Gibbs\r\n  Sewing Machine Co.    ....     ....  14,152  30,127    15,881   12,758\r\n\r\n  Domestic Sewing\r\n  Machine Company       ....     ....    ....  10,397    40,114   23,587\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing table it will be seen that as far back as a quarter\r\nof a century ago the output of machines was over a half a million a\r\nyear. By 1877 all of the fundamental patents on the sewing machine had\r\nexpired, but the continued activity of inventors in this field is\r\nattested by the fact that to-day there are many thousands of patents\r\nrelating to the sewing machine and its parts. Besides those relating to\r\nthe organization of the machine itself there is an endless variety of\r\nattachments, such as hemmers, tuckers, fellers, quilters, binders,\r\ngatherers and rufflers, embroiderers, corders and button hole\r\nattachments. Every part of the machine has also received separate\r\nattention and separate patents, all tending to the perfection of the\r\nmachine, until to-day, with all fundamental principles public property,\r\nand endless improvements in details, it is difficult to discriminate as\r\nto comparative excellence.\r\n\r\nThere is to-day a great variety of sewing machines on the market,\r\nstandard machines for ordinary work, and special machines for numerous\r\nspecial applications. It is said that one concern alone manufactures\r\nover four hundred different varieties of sewing machines.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important and revolutionary of the applications of the\r\nsewing machine is for making shoes. Prior to 1861 shoemaking was\r\nconfined to the slow, laborious hand methods of the shoemaker. Cheap\r\nshoes could only be made by roughly fastening the soles to the uppers by\r\nwooden pegs, whose row of projecting points within has made many a man\r\nand boy do unnecessary penance. Hand sewed shoes cost from $8 to $12 a\r\npair, and were too expensive a luxury for any but the rich. With the\r\nMcKay shoe sewing machine in 1861, however, comfortable shoes were made,\r\nwith the soles strongly and substantially sewed to the uppers, at a less\r\nprice even than the coarse and clumsy pegged variety. The McKay machine\r\nwas the result of more than three years patient study and work. It was\r\ncovered by United States patents No. 35,105, April 29, 1862; No. 35,165,\r\nMay 6, 1862; No. 36,163, Aug. 12, 1862; and No. 45,422, Dec. 13, 1864,\r\nand its development cost $130,000 before practical results were\r\nobtained. A modern form of it is shown in Fig. 147. In preparing a shoe\r\nfor the machine, an inner sole is placed on the last, the upper is then\r\nlasted and its edges secured to the inner sole. An outer sole, channeled\r\nto receive the stitches, is then tacked on so that the edges of the\r\nupper are caught and retained between the two soles. The shoe is then\r\nplaced on the end of a rotary support called a horn, which holds it up\r\nto the needle. A spool containing thread coated with shoemakers’ wax is\r\ncarried by the horn, and the thread, with its wax kept soft by a lamp,\r\nruns up the inside of the horn to the whirl. The latter is a small ring\r\nplaced at the upper end of the horn, and through which there is an\r\nopening for the passage of the needle. The needle has a barb, or hook,\r\nand as it descends through the sole the whirl lays the thread in this\r\nhook, and as the needle rises it draws the thread through the soles and\r\nforms a chain stitch in the external channel of the outer sole. As the\r\nsewing proceeds, the horn is rotated so as to bring every part of the\r\nmargin of the sole under the needle. With this machine a single operator\r\nhas been able to sew nine hundred pairs of shoes in a day of ten hours,\r\nand five hundred to six hundred pairs is only an average workman’s\r\noutput. It is said that up to 1877 there were 350,000,000 pairs of shoes\r\nmade on this machine in the United States, and probably an equal or\r\ngreater number in Europe. Shoes made on this machine were strongly made\r\nand comfortable, but they could not be resoled by a shoemaker, except by\r\npegging or nailing, and the soles were furthermore somewhat stiff and\r\nlacking in flexibility. To meet these difficulties, a new machine known\r\nas the “Goodyear Welt Machine,” was patented in 1871 and 1875, and\r\nbrought out a little later. This sewed a welt to an upper, which welt in\r\na subsequent operation was sewed by an external row of stitches to the\r\nsole. This gave much greater flexibility, and the further advantage of\r\nenabling a shoemaker to half sole the shoe by the old method of hand\r\nsewing. This advanced the art of shoemaking in the finer varieties of\r\nshoes, and to-day nearly all men’s fine shoes are made in this way. The\r\nintroduction of the sewing machine into the shoe industry made a new era\r\nin foot wear, and it is said that no nation on earth is so well and\r\ncheaply shod as the people of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 147.--MCKAY SHOE SEWING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nA buttonhole does not strike the average person as a thing of any\r\nimportance whatever. The needlewoman, however, who has to patiently\r\nstitch around and form the buttonholes, knows differently, and when this\r\nneedlewoman, working in the great shirt factories and shoe factories, is\r\nconfronted with the many millions of buttonholes in collars, cuffs,\r\nshirts and shoes, the great amount of this painstaking and nerve\r\ndestroying labor becomes appalling. For cheapening the cost of\r\nbuttonholes, and reducing the hand labor, various buttonhole machines\r\nand attachments to sewing machines have been devised. Patents Nos.\r\n36,616 and 36,617, to Humphrey, Oct. 7, 1862, covered one of the\r\nearliest forms, but the Reece buttonhole machine, which is specially\r\ndevised for the work, is one of the most modern and successful. It was\r\npatented April 26, 1881, Sept. 21, 1886, and Aug. 20, 1895. These\r\nmachines mark an important departure, which consists in working the\r\nbuttonhole by moving the stitch forming mechanism about the buttonhole,\r\ninstead of moving the fabric. An illustration of the machine is given in\r\nFig. 148. Upon this machine 10,010 button holes have been made in nine\r\nhours and fifty minutes. The machine first cuts the buttonhole, then\r\ntransfers it to the stitching devices, which stitch and bar the\r\nbuttonhole, finishing it entirely in an automatic manner. The saving\r\ninvolved to the manufacturer by this machine over the hand method is\r\nseveral hundred per cent., but the relief to the needlewoman is of far\r\ngreater consequence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 148.--REECE BUTTONHOLE MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nMany striking applications of the sewing machine to various kinds of\r\nwork have been made. A recent one is the automatic power carpet sewing\r\nmachine, made and sold by the Singer Manufacturing Company. It was\r\npatented by E. B. Allen in 1894. This machine in general appearance\r\nresembles a miniature elevated railroad. It consists of an elevated\r\ntrack about thirty-six feet long, sustained every three or four feet\r\nupon standards, and having clamping jaws, which hold together the upper\r\nedges of the two lengths of carpet to be sewed together. A compact\r\nlittle stitching apparatus, not larger than a tea-pot, is actuated by an\r\nendless belt from an electric motor at one end. The little machine runs\r\nalong and stitches together the upper edges of the suspended carpet\r\nlengths, and as it crawls along at its work, it strikingly reminds one\r\nof the movements of a squirrel along the top of a rail fence. This\r\nmachine will sew five yards of seam every minute, fastening together\r\nevenly and strongly ten yards of carpet, and entirely dispensing with\r\nall hand labor in this roughest and most trying of all fabrics.\r\n\r\nProbably no organized piece of machinery has ever been so systematically\r\nexploited, so thoroughly advertised, so persistently canvassed, and so\r\nextensively sold as the sewing machine. With their main central offices,\r\ntheir branch offices, sub-agencies and traveling canvassers in wagons,\r\nevery city, village, hamlet, and farmhouse has been actively besieged,\r\nand with the enticing system of payment by instalments there is scarcely\r\na home too humble to be without its sewing machine. The retail price of\r\nsewing machines bears no proper relation to their cost, but this price\r\nto the consumer results from the liberal commissions to agents, and the\r\nexpensive methods of canvassing. In the early days of the sewing machine\r\nits sales were chiefly for family use, but this is now no longer the\r\ncase. While almost every family owns a sewing machine, it is only\r\nbrought into requisition for finer and special varieties of work, since\r\nnearly all the clothing of men, women and children can now be purchased\r\nready made, at a price much less than the cost of the material and the\r\nlabor of making it up. A man to-day buys a ready-made shirt for fifty\r\ncents, which fifty years ago would have cost him $2. This has largely\r\ntransferred the sphere of action of the sewing machine from the family\r\nto the factory. Great factories now make ready-made clothing for men,\r\nwomen and children, shirts, collars and cuffs, shoes, hats, caps,\r\nawnings, tents, sails, bags, flags, banners, corsets, gloves,\r\npocketbooks, harness, saddlery, rubber goods, etc., and all these\r\nindustries are founded upon the sewing machine, which may be seen in\r\nlong rows beside the factory walls, busily supplying the demand of the\r\nworld. With this transition in the sewing machine foot treadles are no\r\nlonger relied on, but the machines are run by power from countershafts.\r\nThis, in turn, has opened up possibilities of much higher speed and\r\ngreater efficiency in the machine. Inventors have found, however, that\r\nhigh speed is handicapped with certain limitations. Beyond a certain\r\nspeed the needle gets hot from friction, which burns off the thread and\r\ndraws the temper. Cams and springs, moreover, are not positive enough in\r\naction, as the resilience of the spring does not act quickly enough, and\r\nso more positive gearings, such as eccentrics and cranks, must be\r\nemployed. Despite these difficulties, however, the modern factory\r\nmachine has raised the speed of the old-time sewing machine from a few\r\nhundred stitches a minute to three and four thousand stitches a minute.\r\n\r\nThe United States is the home of the sewing machine, and New York City\r\nis the center of the industry, probably 90 per cent. of the sewing\r\nmachine trade being managed and handled there. German manufacturers are\r\nmaking great efforts to compete in this field, but American machines are\r\ngenerally regarded as the best in the world.\r\n\r\nAmong those prominently interested in the machine in its early days were\r\nOrlando B. Potter and the law firm of Jordan & Clarke. The latter were\r\nattorneys representing some of the prominent inventors in litigation,\r\nand in this way Mr. Edward Clarke became interested in the business, and\r\nit was he who in 1856 instituted the system of selling on the instalment\r\nplan. For some years before his death Mr. Clarke was the president of\r\nthe Singer Company.\r\n\r\nRecent statistics in relation to the sewing machine industry are\r\ndifficult to obtain, partly by reason of the great extent and\r\nramifications of the business, and partly by reason of the unwillingness\r\nof the larger companies to give out data for publication. At the Patent\r\nCentennial in Washington, in 1891, Ex-Commissioner of Patents\r\nButterworth made the statement that “Cæsar conquered Gaul with a force\r\nnumerically less than was employed in inventing and perfecting the parts\r\nof the sewing machine.” The great Singer Company, with headquarters at\r\nNew York, operates not only a factory at Elizabethport, N. J., employing\r\n5,000 men, but also other factories in Europe and Canada, the one at\r\nKilbowie, Scotland, employing 6,000 men. Of the total of 13,500,000\r\nmachines made by this company from 1853 to the end of 1896, nearly\r\n6,000,000 have been made in factories located abroad, but directly\r\ncontrolled and managed by the New York office. It is stated that the\r\npresent output of the American factory of the Singer Company amounts to\r\nover 11,000 weekly, or more than half a million annually. Although so\r\nmany sewing machines are made abroad, the exports from the United States\r\nfor 1899 amounted to $3,264,344.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Howe sewing machine it was denounced as a\r\nmenace to the occupations of the thousands of men and women who worked\r\nin the clothing shops, and the struggles of the inventor against this\r\nopposition and discouragement form an interesting page of history. But\r\nit had come to stay and to grow. Some 7,000 United States patents attest\r\nthe interest and ingenuity in this field, in the neighborhood of 100,000\r\npersons make a living from the manufacture and sale of the machine,\r\nmillions find profitable employment in its use, and from 700,000 to\r\n800,000 machines are annually manufactured in the United States. The\r\noutput of all countries is estimated to be from 1,200,000 to 1,300,000\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nThe sewing machine has for its objective result only the simple and\r\ninsignificant function of fastening one piece of fabric to another, but\r\nits influence upon civilization in ministering to the wants of the race\r\nhas been so great as to cause it to be numbered with the epoch-making\r\ninventions of the age. It has created new industries. It has given\r\nuseful employment to capital, has extended the lists of the wage earner,\r\nand increased his daily pay. It has clothed the naked, fed the hungry,\r\nand warded off the ravages of cold and death; but, best of all its\r\ntuneful accompaniment has lightened the heart and smoothed the pathway\r\nof life for Hood’s weary working woman, to whose tired fingers and\r\naching eyes it has brought the balm of much-needed rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE REAPER.\r\n\r\n    EARLY ENGLISH MACHINES--MACHINE OF PATRICK BELL--THE HUSSEY\r\n    REAPER--MCCORMICK’S REAPER AND ITS GREAT SUCCESS--RIVALRY BETWEEN\r\n    THE TWO AMERICAN REAPERS--SELF RAKERS--AUTOMATIC BINDERS--COMBINED\r\n    STEAM REAPER AND THRESHING MACHINE--GREAT WHEAT FIELDS OF THE\r\n    WEST--STATISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the harvest scenes upon the tombs of ancient Thebes the thirsty\r\nreaper is depicted, with curved sickle in hand, alternately bending his\r\nback to the grain and refreshing himself at the skin bottle. For more\r\nthan thirty centuries did man thus continue to earn his bread by the\r\nsweat of his brow. Even to the present time the scythe, with its cradle\r\nof wooden fingers, is occasionally met with, and it is to the older\r\ngeneration a familiar suggestion of the sweat, toil, bustle and\r\nexcitement of the old harvest time. But all this has been changed by the\r\nadvent of the reaper, and ere long the grain cradle will hang on the\r\nwalls of the museum as an ethnological specimen only.\r\n\r\nThe first reaper of which we find historical evidence is that described\r\nby Pliny in the first century of the Christian Era (A. D. 70). He says:\r\n“The mode of getting in the harvest varies considerably. In the vast\r\ndomains of the province of Gaul a large hollow frame, armed with\r\ncomb-like teeth, and supported on two wheels, is driven through the\r\nstanding grain, the beasts being yoked behind it (in contrarium juncto),\r\nthe result being that the ears are torn off and fall within the frame.”\r\n\r\nThis crude machine has in late years been many times re-invented, and it\r\nfinds a special application to-day for the gathering of clover seeds,\r\nand is called a “header.”\r\n\r\nThe first attempt of modern times to devise a reaper was the English\r\nmachine of Pitt, in 1786, which followed the principle of the old Gallic\r\nimplement, in that it stripped the heads from the standing grain. The\r\nPitt machine, however, had a revolving cylinder on which were rows of\r\ncomb teeth, which tore off the heads of grain and discharged them into a\r\nreceptacle. In 1799 Boyce, of England, invented the vertical shaft, with\r\nhorizontally rotating cutters. In 1800 Mears devised a machine\r\nemploying shears. In 1806 Gladstone devised a front-draft, side-cut\r\nmachine, in which a curved segment-bar with fingers gathered the grain\r\nand held it while a horizontally revolving knife cut the same. In 1811\r\nCumming introduced the reel, and in 1814 Dobbs described a wheelbarrow\r\narrangement of reaper in which he used the divider. In 1822 the\r\nimportant improvement of the reciprocating knife bar was made by Ogle,\r\nwhich became a characteristic feature of all subsequent successful\r\nreapers. It was drawn by horses in front. The cutter bar projected at\r\nthe side. It had a reel to gather the grain to the cutter, and the grain\r\nplatform was tilted to drop the gavel. In 1826 Rev. Patrick Bell, of\r\nScotland, devised a reaper that had a movable vibrating cutter working\r\nlike a series of shears, a reel, and a traveling apron, which carried\r\noff the grain to one side. This machine was pushed from behind, and,\r\nwith a swath of five feet, cut an acre in an hour. It was, however, for\r\nsome reason laid aside till 1851, when it was reorganized and put in\r\nservice at the World’s Fair in London in competition with the American\r\nmachines. All the earlier experiments in the development of the reaper\r\nwere made in England. Grain raising was in its infancy in the United\r\nStates, and near the end of the Eighteenth Century the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society of England had stimulated its own inventors by\r\noffering a prize for the production of a successful reaper, and\r\ncontinued thus to offer it for many years. There is no evidence,\r\nhowever, that the preceding machines attained any practical results,\r\nand it remained for the fertility of American genius to invent a\r\npractical reaper which satisfactorily performed its work, and continued\r\nto do so. Quite a number of patents for reapers were granted to American\r\ninventors in the early part of the century, among which may be mentioned\r\nthat to Manning, of Plainfield, N. J., May 3, 1831, which embodied\r\nfinger bars to hold the grain and a reciprocating cutter bar with\r\nspear-shaped blades.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 149.--PATENT OFFICE DRAWING, HUSSEY’S REAPER,\r\nDECEMBER 31, 1833.]\r\n\r\nCyrus H. McCormick, of Virginia, and Obed Hussey, of Maryland, were the\r\nmen who brought the reaper to a condition of practical utility.\r\nThe commercial development of their machines was practically\r\ncontemporaneous, and their respective claims for superiority had about\r\nan equal number of supporters among the farmers of that day. Hussey,\r\noriginally of Cincinnati, but afterwards of Maryland, was the first to\r\nobtain a patent, which was granted December 31, 1833. An illustration of\r\nthe patent drawing is given in Fig. 149. It embodied a reciprocating saw\r\ntooth cutter _f_ sliding within double guard fingers _e_. It had a front\r\ndraft, side-cut, and a platform. The cutter was driven by a pitman from\r\na crank shaft operated through gear wheels from the main drive wheels.\r\nHis specification provided for the locking or unlocking of the drive\r\nwheels; also for the hinging of the platform, and states that the\r\noperator who takes off the grain may ride on the machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 150.--PATENT OFFICE DRAWING, McCORMICK’S REAPER,\r\nJUNE 21, 1834.]\r\n\r\nOn June 21, 1834, Cyrus H. McCormick, of Virginia, obtained a patent on\r\nhis reaper. In Fig. 150 appears an illustration of his patent drawing.\r\nThis had two features which were not found in the Hussey patent, viz., a\r\nreel on a horizontal axis above the cutter, and a divider L, at the\r\nouter end of the cutter, which divider projected in front of the cutter,\r\nand separated in advance the grain which was to be cut from that which\r\nwas to be left standing. McCormick’s machine had two cutters or knives,\r\nreciprocated by cranks in opposite directions to each other. This\r\nfeature he afterward abandoned, adopting the single knife, described by\r\nhim as an alternative. This machine was to be pushed ahead of the team,\r\nwhich was hitched to the bar C of the tongue B in the rear, but\r\nprovision was made for a front draft by a pair of shafts in front, shown\r\nin dotted lines. The curved dotted line beside the shafts indicated a\r\nbowed guard to press the standing grain away from the horse. The divider\r\nL had a cloth screen extending to the rear of the platform.\r\n\r\nNeither Hussey nor McCormick appears at that time to have been cognizant\r\nof the prior state of the art, and as the patent law of 1836 had not yet\r\nbeen enacted, there was little or no examination as to novelty, and no\r\ninterference proceedings as to priority of invention, and consequently\r\ntheir respective claims were drawn to much that was old, and probably\r\nmuch that would have been in conflict with each other under the present\r\npractice of the Patent Office. In the _Scientific American_, of December\r\n16 and 23, 1854, in a most interesting series of articles on the reaper,\r\nthe Hussey machine is fully described. The first public trial was on\r\nJuly 2, 1833, before the Hamilton County Agricultural Society, near\r\nCarthage, O., and its success was attested by nine witnesses. Great\r\nstress was laid by Mr. Hussey on the double finger bar, _i. e._, a\r\nfinger bar having one member above and the other below the knife. The\r\n_Scientific American_ said the machine was a success from the first;\r\nthat “in 1834 the machine was introduced into Illinois and New York, and\r\nin 1837 into Pennsylvania, and in 1838 Mr. Hussey moved from Ohio to\r\nBaltimore, Md., and continued to manufacture his reapers there up to the\r\npresent time.”\r\n\r\nIn 1836 Hussey was invited by the Maryland Agricultural Society for the\r\nEastern Shore to exhibit his machine before them. On July 1 he did so,\r\nand made practical demonstration of its working to the society at\r\nOxford, Talbot County, and again on July 12 at Easton. On the following\r\nSaturday it was shown at Trappe, and it was afterwards used on the farm\r\nof Mr. Tench Tilghman, where 180 acres of wheat, oats and barley were\r\ncut with it. The report of the Board of Trustees of the society was an\r\nunqualified commendation of the practicability, efficiency and value of\r\nthe machine, and a handsome pair of silver cups was awarded to the\r\ninventor. The report was signed by the following well-known residents of\r\nthe Eastern Shore: Robert H. Goldsborough, Samuel Stevens, Samuel T.\r\nKennard, Robert Banning, Samuel Hambleton, Sr., Nichol Goldsborough, Ed.\r\nN. Hambleton, James L. Chamberlain, Martin Goldsborough, Horatio L.\r\nEdmonson, and Tench Tilghman.\r\n\r\nHussey made and sold his machine for years. In the _American Farmer_, of\r\nOctober, 1847, an agricultural journal printed at Baltimore, the\r\nadvertisement of his machine appears with full price lists of the\r\ndifferent sizes of machines, and also of an improvement in the manner of\r\ndisposing of the grain, which was the invention of Mr. Tench Tilghman,\r\nand was adopted by Hussey on his reaper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 151.--THE McCORMICK REAPER OF 1847.]\r\n\r\nWhile Hussey was at work at his reaper, McCormick also was busily\r\nengaged with his, and he took his second patent January 31, 1845, No.\r\n3,895. This related to the cutter bar, the divider, and reel post.\r\nMcCormick’s next patent was dated October 23, 1847, No. 5,335, and in\r\nthis the raker’s seat was to be mounted on the platform as shown in Fig.\r\n151. McCormick’s last named patent also covered the arrangement of the\r\ngearing and crank in front of the drive wheel, so as to balance the\r\nweight of the raker. In the same year Hussey took out his patent of\r\nAugust 7, 1847, No. 5,227, for the open top and slotted finger guard,\r\nwhich is an important part of all successful cutter bars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 152.--THE MANN HARVESTER OF 1849.]\r\n\r\nThe rivalry between the McCormick and Hussey machines continued for many\r\nyears, and they were frequently in competition both in America and\r\nEngland. The stimulus of this rivalry doubtless had much to do with the\r\ndevelopment and success of the reaper. Both Hussey and McCormick asked\r\nfor extensions of their patents, but they failed to get them. In 1848,\r\npending McCormick’s extension proceedings, facts were introduced by him\r\nto show that his invention of the reaper antedated Hussey’s, and that he\r\nhad made his machine as early as 1831, and had used it then on the farm\r\nof Mr. John Steele, in Virginia. This claim to priority was supported by\r\nthe publication of a description of the machine, and certificate of its\r\nuse, in the _Union_, a newspaper published at Lexington, Va., September\r\n28, 1833, and although no adjudication was ever made on this issue, this\r\nfact, together with Mr. McCormick’s success in the contest in England in\r\n1851, and his subsequent persistence and activity in improving,\r\ndeveloping and introducing the reaper, has so distinguished him in this\r\nconnection, that to-day his name is as commonly associated with the\r\nreaper as is Fulton’s with the steamboat, or that of Morse with the\r\ntelegraph. To Mr. McCormick more than to anybody else the perfection of\r\nthe reaper is due. In the spring of 1851 McCormick placed his reaper on\r\nexhibition at the World’s Fair in London. Hussey also had his machine\r\nthere, and they were the only ones represented. The machines were tested\r\nin the field, and astonished all who saw them operate. The Grand Council\r\nmedal, which was one of four special medals awarded for marked epochs in\r\nprogress, was given to McCormick, and the judges referred to the\r\nMcCormick machine as being worth to the people of England “the whole\r\ncost of the exposition.” It is only fair to state that Hussey was not\r\npresent to direct the trial of his machine, and that in a subsequent\r\ntrial another jury decided in his favor, and His Royal Highness, Prince\r\nAlbert, ordered two of Hussey’s machines in 1851--one for Windsor and\r\nthe other for the Isle of Wight. The Duke of Marlborough also gave his\r\npersonal testimonial to Mr. Hussey as to the excellence of his machine.\r\nIn 1855, at a competitive trial of reapers near Paris, three machines\r\nwere entered. The American machine cut an acre of oats in twenty-two\r\nminutes, the English machine in sixty-six minutes, and the Algerian in\r\nseventy-two. In 1863, at the great International Exposition at Hamburg,\r\nthe McCormick reaper again took the grand prize. While in Paris in 1878\r\nMr. McCormick was elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences as\r\n“having done more for the cause of agriculture than any living man.” Mr.\r\nMcCormick continued to the end of his days, in 1884, to devote his\r\nentire energies to the development of the reaper, and well deserved the\r\nprincely fortune that resulted from his indefatigable labors, a good\r\nportion of which fortune he spent during his life in the cause of\r\neducation and acts of philanthropy. The inventory of his estate, filed\r\nin the Probate Court of Cook County, Ill., showed $10,000,000 as the\r\nreward of his genius and industry, and is an object lesson of the reward\r\nof merit for the ambitious youth of the Twentieth Century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 153.--THE MARSH HARVESTER OF 1858.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 154.--THE CHAMPION REAPER.]\r\n\r\nIn the development of the reaper one of the first deficiencies to be\r\nsupplied was automatic mechanism for taking the grain from the\r\nplatform. In November, 1848, F. S. Pease took out patent No. 5,925 for\r\na rake whose teeth projected up through slots in the platform, and moved\r\nback and forth to deposit the grain upon the ground. On June 19, 1849,\r\nJ. J. & H. F. Mann took out patent No. 6,540 on a machine employing the\r\nprinciple of an endless band for carrying the cut grain to the side of\r\nthe machine, where it passed up an inclined plane and accumulated in a\r\nreceptacle to form a gavel, which was clumped upon the ground. This\r\nmachine is shown in Fig. 152. On July 8, 1851, W. H. Seymour took out\r\npatent No. 8,212 for a self-raker, and this machine marks the beginning\r\nof the era of self-raking reapers, which for a quarter of a century in\r\nvarious modifications continued to be used, until displaced by\r\nsubsequent improvements in binding devices. In 1853 the Sylla and Adams\r\nmachine was brought out, the patents for which were bought by the\r\nAultmans, and the Aultman and Miller, or “Buckeye” harvester, was\r\nmanufactured thereunder. The general form of the modern harvester has\r\nfollowed along the lines of the Mann machine of 1849. The development\r\nbegan by replacing the gavel receptacle on the right of that machine\r\n(Fig. 152) with a platform on which stood men who rode on the machine as\r\nthey bound the grain. An early and important example of a harvester of\r\nthis class is given in the Marsh machine, patented August 15, 1858, No.\r\n21,207, and shown in Fig. 153. To this type of machine the self-binding\r\ndevices were subsequently applied, but before they materialized many\r\nother improvements in self-rakers were made and applied, among which may\r\nbe mentioned the combined rake and reel of Owen Dorsey, of Maryland\r\n(1856), sweeping horizontally across the quadrantal platform; the\r\nMcClintock Young revolving reel, carrying a rake; the Henderson rake\r\n(1860) used on the Wood machine; the Seiberling dropper (1861), which\r\nconsisted of a slotted platform which moved to discharge the gavel; and\r\nthe various improvements covered by Whiteley’s patents, which were\r\nembodied in the Champion reaper, of Springfield, O., and which is shown\r\nin Fig. 154. This machine had a combined rake and reel of the Dorsey\r\ntype, whose arms moved over a circular inclined and stationary cam, and\r\nwhose rakes had a horizontal sweep over the platform, and a vertical\r\nreturn over the wheels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 155.--THE LOCKE WIRE BINDER OF 1873.]\r\n\r\nThe next step, and, perhaps the most important one, in the development\r\nof the reaper, was in providing automatic devices for binding the gavels\r\nof grain into sheaves. John E. Heath, of Ohio, in patent No. 7,520, of\r\nJuly 22, 1850, was the pioneer, and he used cord. Watson, Renwick &\r\nWatson, in patent No. 8,083, of May 13, 1851, and C. A. McPhitridge, in\r\npatent No. 16,097, of November 18, 1856, quickly followed in the attempt\r\nto provide such a device, the former using cord and the latter wire. But\r\nthe problem was not an easy one to solve. On November 16, 1858, W. Grey\r\ntook out patent No. 22,074, for starting the binding mechanism by the\r\nweight of the bundle. Probably the first to complete a binding\r\nattachment that was partly automatic, and to attach it to a reaping\r\nmachine, were H. M. & W. W. Burson, of Illinois. On June 26, 1860, and\r\nOctober 4, 1864, W. W. Burson patented a cord binder, and in 1863 one\r\nthousand machines were built. These machines, however, used wire, and\r\nbeing assisted in their operations by hand labor, were not truly\r\nautomatic. On February 16, 1864, Jacob Behel, of Illinois, obtained a\r\npatent, No. 41,661, for a very important invention in binders. He showed\r\nand claimed for the first time the knotting bill, which loops and forms\r\nthe knot, and the turning cord holder for retaining the end of the cord.\r\nOn May 31, 1870, George H. Spaulding took out patent No. 103,673 for a\r\nbinder which automatically regulated the bundles to a uniform size.\r\nSylvanus D. Locke, of Wisconsin, was the next inventor who undertook to\r\nsolve the problem. He took out patents No. 121,290, November 28, 1871,\r\nand No. 149,233, March 31, 1874, and many others. In 1873 he associated\r\nhimself with Walter A. Wood, and they built and sold probably the first\r\nautomatic self-binding harvester that was ever put upon the market. The\r\nLocke wire binder of 1873 is shown in Fig. 155. The use of wire,\r\nhowever, for binding grain, involved certain objections in that it\r\nrequired a special cutting tool for cutting the sheaves at the thresher,\r\nand it was not easy to remove the wire, and parts of it were likely to\r\ngo through the thresher. Inventors accordingly concentrated their\r\nattention on the use of twine or cord. Marquis L. Gorham, of Illinois,\r\nbuilt a successful twine binder, and had it at work in the harvest field\r\nin 1874. This machine, covered by patent No. 159,506, February 9, 1875,\r\nnot only bound by cord, but produced bundles of the same size. The grain\r\nin this machine is delivered by the elevator of the harvester upon a\r\nplatform, where it is seized by packers and carried forward into a\r\nsecond chamber, where it is compacted by the packers against a yielding\r\ntrip, so that when sufficient grain is accumulated, the trip will yield\r\nand start the binding mechanism into operation. The ball of cord carried\r\non the machine has one end threaded through the needle and fastened in a\r\nholder. The grain is forced against the cord by the packers, and when\r\nthe binder starts the needle encircles the gavel, carrying the cord to a\r\nknotting bill, and the end is again seized by the rotating holder, the\r\nloop formed, the ends of the band severed, and the bound bundle is\r\ndischarged from the machine. A gate, which has in the meantime shut off\r\nthe flow of grain, is now drawn back, and the operation is repeated. On\r\nFebruary 18, 1879, John F. Appleby took out a patent, No. 212,420, for\r\nan improvement on the Gorham binder. In Fig. 156 is shown a modern\r\nautomatic self-binding reaper which embodies the fundamental principles\r\nof McCormick and Hussey, the inclined elevator and platform shown by\r\nMarsh, and the automatic binding devices of Behel, Gorham and Appleby.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 156.--MODERN AUTOMATIC SELF-BINDING REAPER.]\r\n\r\nThis machine, under favorable conditions, with one driver, cuts twenty\r\nacres of wheat in a day, binds it, and carries the bound bundles into\r\nwindrows, and with one shocker, performs the work of twenty men, and\r\ndoes it better, the saving in the waste of grain over hand labor being\r\nsufficient to pay for the twine used in binding. It is said that the\r\nself-binding reaper has reduced the cost of harvesting grain to less\r\nthan half a cent a bushel.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that more than 180,000 machines of the self-binding type\r\nare now produced yearly, the manufacturers in Chicago alone turning out\r\nmore than three-fourths of this number. It is not possible to do justice\r\nto all the worthy workers in this great industry. Nearly 10,000 patents\r\nhave been granted on reaping and mowing machines, and the conspicuous\r\nnames of Whiteley, Wood, Atkins, Manny, Yost, and Ketchum, in addition\r\nto those already mentioned, are only a small part of the great army of\r\ninventors who have contributed to the development and perfection of the\r\nreaper.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 it is said there were but three reapers made. To-day the total\r\nnumber of self-binding harvesters, reapers and mowers in use is\r\nestimated to be two millions. The growth of this industry in the four\r\nearlier decades is as follows (the relatively small increase between\r\n1860 and 1870 being accounted for by the Civil War):\r\n\r\n                  1840.  1850.   1860.   1870.   1880.\r\n\r\n  Machines made       3  3,000  20,000  30,000  60,000\r\n\r\nImmediately succeeding this period the automatic cord binder was put\r\ninto use, and within five years the increase in output of reapers and\r\nmowers was very great. In 1885 more than 100,000 self-binding harvesters\r\nand 150,000 reapers and mowers were built and sold. In 1890 two\r\nmanufacturing establishments in Chicago made more than 200,000 machines,\r\nhalf of which were self-binders and the other half reapers and mowers,\r\nand these two institutions alone employed in their various branches of\r\nmanufacturing and selling 10,000 employees. In 1895 the output of the\r\nlargest of these manufacturing establishments was 60,000 self-binding\r\nharvesters, fitted with bundle carriers and trucks, 61,000 mowers,\r\n10,000 corn harvesters, and 5,000 reapers, making 136,000 machines in\r\nall. In 1898 the output of this one factory for the year was 74,000\r\nself-binding harvesters, 107,000 mowers, 9,000 corn harvesters, and\r\n10,000 reapers, amounting to 200,000 machines. This output, together\r\nwith 75,000 horse rakes, also made, averaged a complete machine for\r\nevery forty seconds in the year, working ten hours a day. The estimated\r\nannual production of all factories in this class of agricultural\r\nimplements is 180,000 self-binding harvesters, 250,000 mowing machines,\r\n18,000 corn harvesters, and 25,000 reapers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 157.--STEAM HARVESTER AND THRESHER.\r\n\r\nThe wheat is headed, threshed, cleaned and sacked by this machine in one\r\ncontinuous operation.--Cutter, 26 feet wide; Capacity, 75 acres per\r\nday.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 158.--FIFTY HORSE POWER STEAM PLANTING COMBINATION.\r\n\r\nTraction engine pulling sixteen 10-inch plows, four 6-foot harrows, and\r\na drill.]\r\n\r\nThere were exported in the year 1880 about 800 self-binding harvesters,\r\n2,000 reapers, and 1,000 mowers. In 1890 this was increased to 3,000\r\nself-binding harvesters, 4,000 reapers, and 2,000 mowers. The total\r\nvalue of mowers and reapers exported in 1890 was $2,092,638. The growth\r\nsubsequent to 1890 is well attested by the exports for 1899, which for\r\nmowers and reapers was $9,053,830, or more than four times what it was\r\nin 1890. These exported machines harvest the crops of the Argentine\r\nRepublic, Paraguay, and Uruguay, of South America; carry their\r\nlabor-saving values to Australia and New Zealand; traverse the wheat\r\nfields along the banks of the Red Sea and the Volga, and are used\r\nthroughout all the continent of Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 159.--A WESTERN HARVEST SCENE (LEFT SECTION OF\r\nVIEW).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 159.--A WESTERN HARVEST SCENE (RIGHT SECTION OF\r\nVIEW).]\r\n\r\nWith the self-binding harvester performing the work of twenty men,\r\ncutting and binding the grain, and arranging the bundles in windrows, it\r\nwould seem that perfection in this art had been reached, but the\r\ntendency of the age is to do things on a constantly increasing scale,\r\nand so the latest developments in harvesters comprise a mammoth machine\r\n(Fig. 157) propelled across the grain fields by steam, and which by the\r\nsame power cuts a swath from 26 to 28 feet wide, threshes it at once as\r\nit moves along, blows out the chaff, and puts the grain in bags at the\r\nrate of three bags per minute, each bag containing one hundred and\r\nfifteen pounds, and requiring two expert bag sewers to take the grain\r\naway from the spout, sew the bags, and dump them on the ground.\r\nSeventy-five acres a day is its task. A companion piece to this machine\r\nis illustrated in Fig. 158, which shows the same power utilized for\r\nplanting. A powerful steam traction engine of fifty horse power hauls\r\nacross the field a planting combination of sixteen ten-inch plows, four\r\nsix-foot harrows and a seeding drill in the rear. Such great reaping\r\nmachines only find useful application in the enormous wheat fields of\r\nCalifornia and the Pacific Coast States, where the dry climate permits\r\nthe grain to ripen and dry sufficiently while standing in the field.\r\nMoreover, only the heads of the grain are cut, the straw being left\r\nstanding. Some conception of the enormous scale upon which grain is\r\nraised in the Western States may be gotten from the dimensions of the\r\nfarms. It is said that Dr. Glenn’s wheat farm comprises 45,000 acres;\r\nthe Dalrymples’, in North Dakota, 70,000; and Mr. Mitchell, in the San\r\nJoaquin Valley, in California, has 90,000 acres. The Dalrymple farms in\r\n1893 had 54,000 acres in wheat, and employed 283 self-binding reapers to\r\nharvest the crop. There is a single unbroken wheat field on the banks of\r\nthe San Joaquin River, near the town of Clovis, in Madera County,\r\nCalifornia, which comprises 25,000 acres, or nearly forty square miles\r\nof wheat--a veritable sea of waving grain. The field is nearly square;\r\neach side is a little over six miles long. If its shape were changed to\r\nthe width of one mile, the field would then be forty miles long. It has\r\nbeen said of the grain fields of the West, that the men and teams eat\r\nbreakfast at one end of a furrow, take dinner in the middle of the\r\nrow, and at night camp and sup at the end of the same row. With a field\r\nof such proportions it is not difficult to see how this may be true. The\r\ncultivation and garnering of crops from such vast areas can only be\r\nappreciated by comparisons. If it were one man’s work to plow such a\r\nfield, even with a double gang plow, cutting a furrow twenty-four inches\r\nwide, he would travel 105,600 miles, which would be equivalent to going\r\naround the world four times. If he plowed twenty miles a day, it would\r\ntake 5,280 days. To harrow would require as long, and to plant would\r\ntake about the same time, or about forty-three years altogether. A full\r\nlifetime would be required to plant the crop, and a second generation\r\nwould be required to reap it. But great results require great agencies,\r\nand so great labor-saving machines, operated by armies of men, are\r\nbrought into requisition, and with these the crop is both planted and\r\nreaped. A long procession of self-binding harvesters, following close\r\none behind the other, makes quick work of it, and before the weather\r\nchanges this great field is mowed, its crop garnered, and bread supplied\r\nfor the hungry of all lands.\r\n\r\nThe exports of wheat to foreign lands in 1898 were 148,231,261 bushels,\r\nworth $145,684,659, and the exports of wheat flour for the same year\r\nwere 15,349,943 barrels, worth $69,263,718. The total yield of wheat in\r\nthe United States for 1898 was 675,148,705 bushels.\r\n\r\nWith the fertile earth, and its prolific inventors, the United States\r\nhas become the richest country in the world. What its future is to be no\r\nman may say, but its destiny is not yet fulfilled, and it is pregnant\r\nwith potential possibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nVULCANIZED RUBBER.\r\n\r\n    EARLY USE OF CAOUTCHOUC BY THE INDIANS--COLLECTION OF THE GUM--EARLY\r\n    EXPERIMENTS FAILURES--GOODYEAR’S PERSISTENT EXPERIMENTS--NATHANIEL\r\n    HAYWARD’S APPLICATION OF SULPHUR TO THE GUM--GOODYEAR’S PROCESS OF\r\n    VULCANIZATION--INTRODUCTION OF HIS PROCESS INTO EUROPE--TRIALS AND\r\n    IMPRISONMENT FOR DEBT--RUBBER SHOE INDUSTRY--GREAT EXTENT AND\r\n    VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS--STATISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost all important inventions have grown into existence by slow stages\r\nof development, and by successive contributions from many minds, not a\r\nfew having descended by gradual processes of evolution from preceding\r\ncenturies. Vulcanized rubber, however, is not of this class. It belongs\r\nexclusively to the Nineteenth Century, and owes its existence to the\r\ntireless energy of one man. The value of the crude gum had been\r\npreviously speculated upon, and for years attempts had been made to\r\nutilize it, but not until Goodyear invented his process of vulcanizing\r\nit did it have any real value. This process was an important, distinct\r\nand unique step, entirely the work of Mr. Goodyear, and it has never\r\nbeen superseded nor improved upon to any extent. Charles Goodyear was\r\nborn in New Haven, December 29, 1800, and his life, beginning two days\r\nin advance of the Nineteenth Century, furnishes an extraordinary\r\nillustration of the struggles and trials of the inventor against adverse\r\nfortune, and is a pathetic example of self denial, indefatigable labor,\r\nand unrequited toil. Of feeble health, small stature, poor, and\r\nfrequently in prison for debt, he made the development of this art the\r\nparamount object of his life, and with a pious faith and unfaltering\r\ncourage for thirty years he devoted himself to this work. Money he cared\r\nnothing for, except in so far as it was necessary to carry on his work,\r\nand he died July 1, 1860, poor in this world’s goods, but rich in the\r\nconsciousness of the great benefit conferred by his invention upon the\r\nhuman race.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 160.--COLLECTING THE GUM.]\r\n\r\nIndia rubber, or caoutchouc, as it is more properly called, is a\r\nconcentrated gum derived from the evaporation of the milky juice of\r\ncertain trees found in South America, Mexico, Central America and the\r\nEast Indies. The South American variety is called _Jatropha elastica_,\r\nand the East Indian variety the _Ficus elastica_. The South American\r\nIndians called it _cahuchu_. The province of Para, south of the equator,\r\nin Brazil, furnishes the largest part and best quality of gum. The tree\r\nfrom which the gum exudes grows to the height of eighty, and sometimes\r\nto one hundred feet. It runs up straight for forty or fifty feet without\r\na branch. Its top is spreading, and is ornamented with a thick and\r\nglossy foliage. The gum is collected by chopping through the bark with a\r\nhatchet and placing under each series of cuts a little clay cup formed\r\nby the hands of the workman. About a gill of the sap accumulates in each\r\ncup in the course of a day, and it is then transferred to receiving\r\nvessels and taken to camp. The first use of the gum was made by the\r\nSouth American Indians, who made shoes, bottles, playing balls and\r\nvarious other articles from it. Their method for making a shoe was to\r\ntake a crude wooden last, which they covered with clay to prevent the\r\nadhesion of the gum. It was then dipped in the sap, or the latter was\r\npoured over it, which gave it a thin coating. It was then held over a\r\nsmoky fire, which gave it a dark color and dried the gum. When one\r\ncoating became sufficiently hard another was added, and smoked in turn,\r\nand so successive coatings were applied until a sufficient thickness was\r\nobtained. When the work was completed it was exposed for some days in\r\nthe sun, and while still soft the shoes were decorated as the fancy or\r\ntaste of the maker suggested. The clay forms were then broken out, and\r\nthe shoe stuffed with grass to keep it in shape for use or sale. In 1820\r\na pair of these clumsy shoes was brought to Boston and exhibited as a\r\ncuriosity. They were covered with gilding, and resembled the shoe of a\r\nChinaman. Subsequently considerable numbers of these shoes were brought\r\nfrom South America, and being sold at a large price, they served to\r\nstimulate Yankee ingenuity into devising methods of making them from the\r\nraw material, which being brought as ballast in the ships from Brazil,\r\ncould be had cheaply. In France some attention had been given to the\r\nmaterial, and the rubber bottles of the Indians had been cut into narrow\r\nthreads which were woven into strips of cloth to form suspenders and\r\ngarters. In England an application of it in thin solution had been made\r\nby a Mr. Macintosh, who spread it between two thicknesses of thin cloth\r\nto form Macintosh water-proof coats. The first practical use of the gum\r\non a large scale was instituted by Mr. Chaffee in Roxbury, Mass., about\r\n1830. He dissolved the gum in spirits of turpentine and invented\r\nsteam-heated rolls for spreading it upon cloth. Companies were formed to\r\nexploit the products, and in the fall and winter of 1833 and 1834 many\r\nthousands of dollars’ worth of goods were made by the Roxbury Company,\r\nbut the business proved a total failure, for in the summer the goods\r\nmelted, decomposed and became so offensive as to be worse than useless,\r\nwhile the cold of winter rendered them stiff and liable to crack. With a\r\nknowledge of these facts and conditions Charles Goodyear commenced his\r\nexperiments, believing that there was a great future for this material\r\nif it could only be prevented from melting in summer and stiffening in\r\nwinter. He tried mixing it with many materials, first using magnesia,\r\nwhich, however, proved ineffective. On June 17, 1837, he took out patent\r\nNo. 240, in which he proposed to destroy the adhesive properties of\r\ncaoutchouc by superficial application of an acid solution of the metals,\r\nnitric acid with copper or bismuth being specially recommended. He also\r\nclaimed the incorporation of lime with the gum to bleach it. Under this\r\nprocess Mr. Goodyear made various articles in the form of fabrics, toys\r\nand ornamental articles, using the fabric to make clothing for himself,\r\nwhich he wore to demonstrate its value and wearing qualities. A striking\r\nword picture of Mr. Goodyear at this time is given by the reply of a\r\ngentleman who, being asked by a man looking for Mr. Goodyear as to how\r\nhe might recognize him, replied, “If you meet a man who has on an India\r\nrubber cap, stock, coat, vest, and shoes, and an India rubber money\r\npurse in his pocket, without a cent of money in it, that is he.”\r\n\r\nMany useful and artistic articles were made under this first patented\r\nprocess, including maps, surgical bandages, etc., and were brought by\r\nMr. Goodyear to the notice of President Jackson, Henry Clay and John C.\r\nCalhoun, from whom he received very encouraging letters. His efforts,\r\nhowever, to introduce his process commercially were not attended with\r\nsuccess. Capitalists and manufacturers had been rendered so conservative\r\nby the large loss of money in the Roxbury Company, that they were\r\ndisinclined to have anything further to do with it. Practically alone he\r\nwas obliged to continue his work. By the kindness of Mr. Chaffee and Mr.\r\nHaskins he was allowed the use of the valuable machinery standing idle\r\nin their factory at Roxbury, and he made shoes, piano covers, table\r\ncloths and carriage covers of superior quality, and from the sale of\r\nthese, and of licenses to manufacture, he for the first time was able to\r\nsupport his family in comfort. Mr. Goodyear had not yet discovered,\r\nhowever, the process of vulcanization, upon which the rubber industry is\r\nfounded. In 1838 Mr. Nathaniel Hayward, of Woburn, Mass., who had been\r\nemployed in the bankrupt rubber company, discovered that the stickiness\r\nof the rubber could be prevented by spreading a small quantity of\r\nsulphur on it. The same result had also been noticed by a German\r\nchemist. On Feb. 24, 1839, Mr. Hayward procured the patent, No. 1,090,\r\non his process, and assigned it to Mr. Goodyear. The patent covered a\r\nprocess of dissolving sulphur in oil of turpentine and mixing it with\r\nthe gum, and also included the incorporation of the dry flowers of\r\nsulphur with the gum, the product afterwards being treated by Mr.\r\nGoodyear’s metallic salt process. This was the starting point of\r\nvulcanization, for vulcanization consists simply in admixing sulphur\r\nwith the rubber, and then subjecting it for six to eight hours to a\r\ntemperature of about 300°. Its effect is to so change the nature of the\r\ngum to prevent it from melting or becoming sticky under the influence of\r\nheat, or of hardening and becoming stiff under the influence of cold,\r\nthe vulcanized gum remaining elastic, impervious, and unchangeable under\r\nall ordinary conditions. This great discovery of the influence of heat\r\non the sulphur treated gum was quite accidental and wholly unexpected.\r\nHeat above all things was the agency which in all previous observations\r\nwas most to be feared, for it was this more than anything else that\r\nmelted down, decomposed and destroyed all of his manufactured articles.\r\nWhile sitting near a hot stove engaged in an animated discussion\r\nconcerning his experiments, a piece of the gum treated with sulphur,\r\nwhich he held in his hand, was, by a rapid gesture, thrown upon the\r\nstove. To his astonishment, he found that this relatively high heat did\r\nnot melt it, as heretofore, and while it charred slightly, it was not\r\nmade at all sticky. He nailed the piece of gum outside the kitchen door\r\nin the intense cold, and upon examining it the next morning found it as\r\nperfectly flexible as when he put it out. Goodyear had discovered the\r\nprocess which afterwards came to be known as “vulcanization.” The\r\ndiscovery was made in 1839, but was not accepted by those to whom it was\r\nsubmitted as possessing any importance. Prof. Silliman, of Yale College,\r\nhowever, in the fall of 1839 testified to the results claimed for it by\r\nMr. Goodyear--that it did not melt with heat, nor stiffen with the cold.\r\nOn June 15, 1844, Mr. Goodyear took out his celebrated patent, No.\r\n3,633, covering this process, in which he not only used sulphur, but\r\nadded a proportion of white lead. The proportions named were 25 parts of\r\nrubber, 5 parts of sulphur, and 7 parts of white lead, the ingredients\r\neither to be ground in spirits of turpentine, or to be incorporated dry\r\nbetween rolls. The odor imparted by the sulphur was to be destroyed by\r\nwashing with potash or vinegar. This patent was reissued in two\r\ndivisions Dec. 25, 1849, and again on Nov. 20, 1860, and was extended\r\nfor seven years from June 15, 1858, which was the end of the first term.\r\nUnder this patent two kinds of rubber were made and sold--“soft rubber,”\r\ncontaining only a small proportion of sulphur, while the other, known as\r\nthe “vulcanite,” “ebonite,” or “hard rubber,” had from 25 to 35 per\r\ncent. of sulphur and was subjected to a longer heat.\r\n\r\nThe history of this patent is a remarkable one. Immensely valuable as it\r\nwas, Goodyear reaped but a small share of the profit, for in the midst\r\nof his poverty and necessities he was obliged to sell licenses and\r\nestablish royalties at a figure far below the real value of the rights\r\nconveyed. Some idea of the great value of the business which Mr.\r\nGoodyear had developed may be had from the fact that the companies who\r\nheld rights under the patent for the manufacture of shoes paid at one\r\ntime to Daniel Webster the enormous fee of $25,000 for defending their\r\npatent interests.\r\n\r\nWith the idea of extending his invention Mr. Goodyear visited England in\r\n1851, where he found that Thomas Hancock, of the house of Macintosh &\r\nCo., had forestalled him, although not the inventor. A peculiar\r\nprovision of the English patent law, which gives the patent to the first\r\nintroducer, permitted this. Nothing daunted, however, he organized a\r\nmagnificent exhibit for the Great International Exhibition held in\r\nCrystal Palace at Hyde Park, London, in 1851. This exhibit cost him\r\n$30,000, and he called it the Goodyear Vulcanite Court. It comprehended\r\nan elegantly constructed suite of open rooms made of hard rubber\r\nornamented with handsome carvings, and furnished with rubber furniture,\r\nmusical instruments, and globes made of rubber, and it was also carpeted\r\nwith the same material. For his exhibit he received the “Grand Council\r\nMedal,” which was one of the highest testimonials of the exposition.\r\nThis exhibit was afterwards moved from London to Sydenham, where it was\r\nexposed and used as an agency for some years for the sale of rubber\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 161.--MACHINE FOR GRINDING AND WASHING CRUDE\r\nRUBBER.]\r\n\r\nMr. Goodyear had obtained a French patent for his invention, and at the\r\nExposition Universelle in Paris, in 1855, he fitted up at an expense of\r\n$50,000 two elegant courts with India rubber furniture, caskets and rich\r\njewelry, and for this exhibit he had conferred upon him by the Emperor\r\nNapoleon the “Grand Medal of Honor” and the “Cross of the Legion of\r\nHonor.” It was a singular instance of the irony of fate that the\r\ndecoration of the “Cross of the Legion of Honor” should have been\r\nconveyed to him while imprisoned for debt in “Clichy,” the debtors’\r\nprison in Paris. The lofty courage of the man was well illustrated at\r\nthis time in his reply to his wife’s solicitous inquiries as to how he\r\nhad spent the night while in prison. He said, “I have been through\r\nnearly every form of trial that human flesh is heir to, and I find that\r\n_there is nothing in life to fear but sin_.” The declining years of his\r\nlife were full of sorrow, pain and affliction, and at his death in 1860\r\nhis estate was $200,000 in debt. He lived long enough, however, to see\r\nhis material applied to nearly five hundred uses, giving employment in\r\nEngland, France and Germany to 60,000 persons, and producing in this\r\ncountry alone goods worth $8,000,000 a year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 162.--MAKING RUBBER CLOTH.]\r\n\r\nThe greatest of all applications of rubber are to be found in the\r\nmanufacture of boots and shoes. The number of attacks of cold,\r\nrheumatism, and death-dealing diseases from wet feet, that have been\r\naverted by the use of rubber shoes, can never be estimated, but perhaps\r\nit is safe to say that the rubber shoe has done more to conserve the\r\nhealth of the human family than any other single article of apparel.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of shoes the finest quality of rubber is received in\r\nwooden boxes 4 × 2 × 1½ feet, containing about 350 pounds in lumps of 1\r\nto 75 pounds. These lumps are cut to suitable size, and are then ground\r\nand washed in the machine shown in Fig. 161, water and steam being\r\nsprayed on the rubber during the operation. It is then worked into\r\nsheets or mats between rolls. From the grinding room the sheets are\r\ntaken to the mixing room, where lampblack, sulphur and other ingredients\r\nare added, and worked into it by being passed many times between heated\r\nrolls, the sheets being finally reduced to a thickness of less than 1/32\r\nof an inch. The rubber sheets are then applied to a cloth backing by\r\ncloth calendering rolls, shown in Fig. 162, which are steam heated and\r\nby great pressure serve to incorporate the sheets of rubber and cloth\r\ninto intimate and inseparable union. Out of this rubber fabric, which is\r\nmade of different thicknesses for the upper, sole and heel, the patterns\r\nfor the shoe are cut, and the parts are deftly fitted around the forms\r\nby girls, and secured by rubber cement, as shown in Fig. 163. The shoes\r\nare then covered with a coat of rubber varnish, and are put into cars\r\nand run into the vulcanizing ovens, where they remain from six to seven\r\nhours at a temperature of about 275°. The goods are then taken out, and\r\nafter being inspected are boxed for the market. The vulcanizing is a\r\nvery important part of the manufacture of a rubber shoe, for it is\r\nabsolutely necessary in order to give them stability and wearing\r\nqualities. A shoe that had not been vulcanized would mash down, spread,\r\nbecome sticky and go to pieces after a few hours’ wear.\r\n\r\nThe rubber shoe industry of the United States is carried on by about\r\nfifteen large companies, representing an investment of many millions of\r\ndollars, most of which companies are located in Massachusetts, Rhode\r\nIsland and Connecticut.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the immensity of this industry may be obtained from the\r\nimport statistics. In 1899 the United States alone imported crude rubber\r\nto the extent of 51,063,066 pounds, as much as 1,000,000 pounds a month\r\ncoming from the single port of Para. The export of manufactured rubber\r\ngoods for the same year amounted to $1,765,385. The statistics for Great\r\nBritain for 1896 showed the imports of rubber to that country to be\r\none-third more than the imports of the United States. Germany also is a\r\nlarge consumer. The great Harburg-Vienna factories cover sixty-seven\r\nacres, are capitalized at 9,000,000 marks, and employ 3,500 hands. Much\r\nfine technical apparatus, toys, and balls are made here, the daily\r\noutput of balls reaching 8,000. These, with the Noah’s arks of India\r\nrubber animals, are the delight of the little ones all over the world.\r\n\r\nAlthough so much in evidence about us, India rubber is not by any means\r\na cheap material. Costing only five cents a pound when Goodyear\r\ncommenced his experiments, it is now worth a dollar a pound, and is\r\ntherefore much more expensive than any of the ordinary metals, woods, or\r\nbuilding materials. Many substitutes in the form of compositions of\r\nvarious ingredients have been devised and patented, but no real\r\nsubstitute for nature’s product has yet been found. For many years old\r\nand worn out rubber goods were thrown away as worthless. Now all such\r\nrubber is reclaimed, and used in many grades of goods which do not\r\nrequire a pure gum. Insatiable as the demands of the trade may appear,\r\nthere is no need to fear a rubber famine, for the forests of trees in\r\nSouth America and the East Indies are practically inexhaustible, and in\r\nthe rich alluvial soil of their habitat nature’s processes of growth\r\nrapidly restore the decimation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 163.--MAKING RUBBER SHOES.]\r\n\r\nSince the time of Goodyear, the amplification of this art and the\r\nmultiplication of uses for rubber, and its increased commercial\r\nimportance, have gone on at such a rate of increase that to-day we may\r\nbe said to be living in the rubber age. Its uses and applications are\r\nlegion, and they extend literally from the cradle to the grave. When the\r\nbaby comes into the world its introduction to India rubber begins at\r\nonce with the nursing bottle and the gum cloth, and when the aged\r\ninvalid takes leave of the world his last moments are soothed with the\r\nwater bag and the rubber bed, and between these extremes we find it in\r\nevidence everywhere about us. In wearing apparel it extends from the\r\ncrown of the head to the sole of the foot--rubber cap, coat, gloves, and\r\nshoes. The man has it in his suspenders and his pipe stem, the woman in\r\nher garters and dress shields, and the baby in its teething ring and\r\nrattle. The soldier stands on picket duty in the rain, and the rubber\r\nblanket protects him from rheumatism. If wounded, the surgeon dresses\r\nhis mangled limb with rubber bandages, and when he gets well he has a\r\nrubber cushion on the end of his crutch, or on the foot of his\r\nartificial leg. If wounded in the mouth perhaps the government gives him\r\na set of artificial teeth on a rubber plate. The rubber mat greets you\r\nat the front door, a little pad cushions the door stops and the backs of\r\nchairs, and a ring seals the mouth of the fruit jar. The whole array of\r\ntoilet articles, including combs, brushes, mirrors, shoe horns, etc.,\r\nare made from it. In the parlor it is found in picture frames and the\r\npiano cover; in the bath room the wash rag, water bag, rubber cup, and\r\nhose pipe of the shower bath are all made of it; in the play room are\r\nfound rubber balls and toys of all kinds; in the kitchen the clothes\r\nwringer and the table cloth; in the dining room the handles of knives,\r\nand the tea tray, and what is more useful and more ubiquitous in the\r\noffice than the rubber band, the rubber ruler, the pencil eraser, or the\r\nfountain pen? But these are only a few of the personal and indoor uses\r\nand applications. Rubber belting for machinery, fire engine and garden\r\nhose, steam engine packing, car springs, covers for carriages and the\r\nbig guns of the navy, life preservers, billiard table cushions, and\r\nchemical and surgical apparatus in endless variety. The electrical world\r\nis almost entirely dependent upon it for the insulation of our ocean\r\ncables and electric light wires, for battery cups, and the insulating\r\nmountings of all electrical apparatus. The pneumatic bicycle tire could\r\nnot exist without rubber, and the modern application of it to this use\r\nalone amounts to nearly four million pounds annually. Every automobile\r\ncarriage takes twenty-five pounds of rubber for each tire, or 100 pounds\r\naltogether. This great and growing industry, together with the now\r\ncommon use of rubber tires on horse-drawn vehicles, raises the sum total\r\nof rubber employed in the arts to an enormous figure.\r\n\r\nThat the sap of an uncultivated tree in a swampy, tropical, and malarial\r\nforest, thousands of miles from civilization, should cut so great a\r\nfigure in the necessities of modern life, seems strange and\r\nunaccountable on any basis of probabilities. It is only another\r\nillustration of the possibilities of the patient and persistent work of\r\nthe inventor. Charles Goodyear took this nearly worthless material, and\r\nmade of it, as Parton said in 1865--“not a new material merely, but a\r\nnew class of materials, applicable to a thousand divers uses. It was\r\nstill India rubber, but its surface would not adhere, nor would it\r\nharden at any degree of cold, nor soften at any degree of heat. It was a\r\ncloth impervious to water; it was a paper that would not tear; it was a\r\nparchment that would not crease; it was leather which neither rain nor\r\nsun would injure; it was ebony that could be run into a mould; it was\r\nivory that could be worked like wax; it was wood that never cracked,\r\nshrunk nor decayed. It was metal, ‘elastic metal,’ as Daniel Webster\r\ntermed it, that could be wound round the finger, or tied into a knot,\r\nand which preserved its elasticity like steel. Trifling variations in\r\nthe ingredients, in the proportion and in the heating, made it either\r\npliable as kid, tougher than ox hide, as elastic as whalebone, or as\r\nrigid as flint.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\n    ITS EVOLUTION AS A SCIENCE--THE COAL TAR PRODUCTS--FERMENTING AND\r\n    BREWING--GLUCOSE, GUN COTTON AND NITRO-GLYCERINE--ELECTRO-CHEMISTRY\r\n    --FERTILIZERS AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS--NEW ELEMENTS OF THE\r\n    NINETEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foundation stones of empirical discovery, upon which this science is\r\nbased, had been crudely shaped by the workmen of preceding centuries,\r\nbut the classification and laying of them into the structure of an exact\r\nscience is the work of the Nineteenth Century. The glass of the\r\nPhœnicians, and the dyes and metallurgical operations of the Egyptians,\r\ninvolved some chemical knowledge; much more did the operations of the\r\nalchemists, who vainly sought to convert the baser metals into gold, but\r\nthese were only the crude building stones, out of which the great\r\ncomplex modern structure has been raised. In the Sixteenth Century the\r\nstudy of chemistry, apart from alchemy, began, and some attention was\r\ngiven to its application to the uses of medicine. Aristotle’s four\r\nelements--fire, air, earth and water--were no longer accepted as\r\nrepresenting a correct theory, and new ones were proposed only to be\r\nfound as erroneous, and to be superseded in time by others.\r\n\r\nBriefly traversing the more important of the earlier steps, there may be\r\nmentioned the phlogiston theory of Stahl in the earlier part of the\r\nEighteenth Century; the discovery of the composition of water by\r\nCavendish in 1766; of oxygen by Priestly and Scheele in 1774; the\r\nelectro-chemical dualistic theory of Lavoisier in the latter part of the\r\nEighteenth Century, followed by a rational nomenclature established by\r\nGuyton de Morveau, Berthollet and Fourcroy; the doctrine of chemical\r\nequivalents by Wenzel in 1777 and Richter in 1792; Dalton’s atomic\r\ntheory; Wollaston’s scale of chemical equivalents; Gay Lussac’s law of\r\ncombining volumes; Berzelius’ system of chemical symbols and theory of\r\ncompound radicals; contributions of Sir Humphrey Davy and Faraday in\r\nelectro-chemistry, and Thenard’s grouping of the metals. These\r\ninteresting phases of development of the old chemistry have been\r\nfollowed by the new theory of substitution, by Dumas and others. This\r\nchange, beginning about 1860 and running through a period of nearly\r\ntwenty years, has gradually supplanted the old electro-chemical\r\ndualistic theory and established the present system.\r\n\r\nAmong the important and interesting achievements of chemistry in the\r\nNineteenth Century is the _artificial production of organic compounds_.\r\nAll such compounds had heretofore been either directly or indirectly\r\nderived from plants or animals. In 1828 Wohler produced urea from\r\ninorganic substances, which was the first example of the synthetic\r\nproduction of organic compounds, and it was for many years the only\r\nproduct so formed. Berthelot, of Paris, by heating carbonic oxide with\r\nhydrate of potash produced formiate of potash, from which formic acid is\r\nobtained; by agitating olefiant gas with oil of vitriol a compound is\r\nproduced from which, upon the addition of water and distillation,\r\nalcohol is formed; he also re-combined the fatty acids with glycerine to\r\nform the original fats.\r\n\r\nIn the classification of this science, it has been divided into\r\ninorganic chemistry, relating to metals, minerals and bodies not\r\nassociated with organic life, and organic chemistry, which was formerly\r\nlimited to matter associated with or the result of growth or life\r\nprocesses, but which is now extended to the broader field of all carbon\r\ncompounds. In later years the most remarkable advances have been made in\r\nthe field of organic chemistry. The four elements carbon, hydrogen,\r\noxygen and nitrogen have been juggled into innumerable associations, and\r\nin various proportions, and endless permutations, have been combined to\r\nproduce an unlimited series of useful compounds, such as dyes,\r\nexplosives, medicines, perfumes, flavoring extracts, disinfectants, etc.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of these compounds are the _coal tar products_.\r\nCoal tar, for many years, was the waste product of gas making. Forty\r\nyears ago about the only use made of it was by the farmer, who painted\r\nthe ends of his fence posts with it to prevent decay, or by the\r\nfisherman, who applied it to the bottoms of his boats and his fishing\r\nnets. To-day the black, offensive and unpromising substance, with\r\nmagical metamorphosis, has been transformed by the chemist into the most\r\nbeautiful dyes, excelling the hues and shades of the rainbow, the most\r\ndelightful perfumes and flavoring extracts, the most useful medicines,\r\nthe most powerful antiseptics, and a product which is the very sweetest\r\nsubstance known. The aniline dyes represent one of the great\r\ndevelopments in this field. In 1826 Unverdorben obtained from indigo a\r\nsubstance which he called “Crystalline.” In 1834 Runge obtained from\r\ncoal tar “Kyanol.” In 1840 Fritzsch obtained from indigo a product which\r\nhe called “Aniline,” from “Anil,” the Portuguese for indigo. Zinin soon\r\nafter obtained “Benzidam.” All these substances were afterward proved to\r\nbe the same as aniline. Perkins’ British patent, No. 1,984, of 1856, is\r\nthe first patented disclosure of the aniline dyes, and represents the\r\nbeginning of their commercial production. This combines sulphate of\r\naniline and bichromate of potash to produce an exquisite lilac, or\r\npurple color. The first United States patent was in 1861, and now there\r\nare about 1,400 patents on carbon dyes and compounds, the most of which\r\nbelong to the coal tar group. In dyes artificial alizarine, by Graebe\r\nand Lieberman (Pat. No. 95,465, Oct. 5, 1869); aniline black, by\r\nLightfoot (Pat. No. 38,589, May 19, 1863); naphthazarin black, by Bohn\r\n(Pat. No. 379,150, March 6, 1888); artificial indigo, by Baeyer (Pat.\r\nNo. 259,629, June 13, 1882); the azo-colors, by Roussin (Pat. No.\r\n210,054, Nov. 19, 1878); and the processes for making colors on fibre,\r\nby Holliday (Pat. No. 241,661, May 17, 1881), are the most important.\r\nThe artificial production of salicylic acid, by Kolbe (Pat. No. 150,867,\r\nMay 12, 1874), marks an important step in antiseptics. Artificial\r\nvanilla, by Fritz Ach (Pat. No. 487,204, Nov. 29, 1892), represents\r\nflavoring extracts; and artificial musk, by Baur (Pat. No. 536,324,\r\nMarch 26, 1895), is an example of perfumes. In medicines a great array\r\nof compounds has been produced, such as antipyrin, the fever remedy, by\r\nKnorr (Pat. No. 307,399, Oct. 28, 1884); phenacetin, by Hinsberg (Pat.\r\nNo. 400,086, March 26, 1889); salol, by Von Nencki (Pat. No. 350,012,\r\nSept. 28, 1886), and sulfonal by Bauman (Pat. No. 396,526, Jan. 22,\r\n1889). To these may be added antikamnia (acetanilide), the headache\r\nremedy, and saccharin, by Fahlberg (Pat. No. 319,082, June 2, 1885),\r\nwhich latter is a substitute for sugar, and thirteen times sweeter than\r\nsugar. Among the more familiar products of coal tar or petroleum are\r\nmoth balls, carbolic acid, benzine, vaseline, and paraffine.\r\n\r\nIn the commercial application of chemistry the work of Louis Pasteur in\r\n_fermenting_ and _brewing_ deserves special notice as making a great\r\nadvance in this art. His United States patent, No. 141,072, July 22,\r\n1873, deals with the manufacture of yeast for brewing.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of _sugar_ and _glucose_ from starch is an industry of\r\ngreat magnitude, which has grown up in the last twenty-five years.\r\nWater, acidulated with 1/100th part of sulphuric acid, is heated to\r\nboiling, and a hot mixture of starch and water is allowed to flow into\r\nit gradually. After boiling a half hour chalk is added to neutralize the\r\nsulphuric acid, and when the sulphate of lime settles the clear syrup is\r\ndrawn off, and either sold as syrup, or is evaporated to produce\r\ncrystallized grape sugar, which latter is only about half as sweet as\r\ncane sugar. Glucose syrup, however, has largely superseded all other\r\ntable syrups, and is extensively used in brewing, for cheap candies, and\r\nfor bee food. Our exports of glucose and grape sugar for 1899 amounted\r\nto 229,003,571 pounds, worth $3,624,890.\r\n\r\nAn important discovery, made in 1846, was that carbohydrates, such as\r\nstarch, sugar, or cellulose, and glycerine, when acted upon by the\r\nstrongest nitric acid, produced compounds remarkable for their explosive\r\ncharacter. _Gun cotton and nitro-glycerine_ are the most conspicuous\r\nexamples. Gun cotton is made by treating raw cotton with nitric acid, to\r\nwhich a proportion of sulphuric acid is added to maintain the strength\r\nof the nitric acid and effect a more perfect conversion. Besides its use\r\nas an explosive, gun cotton when dissolved in ether has found an\r\nimportant application as collodion in the art of photography.\r\nNitro-glycerine only differs in its manufacture from gun cotton in that\r\nglycerine is acted upon by the acids, instead of cotton. Pyroxiline,\r\nxyloidine, and celluloid are allied products, which have found endless\r\napplications in toilet articles and for other uses, as a substitute for\r\nhard rubber.\r\n\r\nThe applications of chemistry in the commercial world have been in\r\nrecent years so numerous and varied that it is not possible to do more\r\nthan to refer to its uses in the manufacture of soda and potash, of\r\nalcohol, ether, chloroform, and ammonia, in soap making, washing\r\ncompounds and tanning, the production of gelatine, the refining of\r\ncotton seed and other oils, the art of oxidizing oils for the\r\nmanufacture of linoleum and oil cloth, the manufacture of fertilizers,\r\nwhite lead and other paints, the preparation of proprietary medicines,\r\nof soda water and photographic chemicals, the manufacture of salt and\r\npreserving compounds, in the fermentation of liquors and brewing of\r\nbeer, the preparation of cements and street pavements, the manufacture\r\nof gas, and the embalming of the dead.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting and, in many respects, the most important,\r\ndevelopment of the last twenty-five years has been in\r\n_electro-chemistry_. Electro-chemical methods are now employed for the\r\nproduction of a large number of elements, such as the alkali and\r\nalkaline earth metals, copper, zinc, aluminum, chromium, manganese, the\r\nhalogens, phosphorus, hydrogen, oxygen, and ozone; various chemicals,\r\nincluding the mineral acids, hydrates, chlorates, hypochlorites,\r\nchromates, permanganates, disinfectants, alkaloids, coal tar dyes, and\r\nvarious carbon compounds; white lead and other pigments; varnish; in\r\nbleaching, dyeing, tanning; in extracting grease from wool; in\r\npurifying water, sewerage, sugar solutions, and alcoholic beverages. The\r\npresent low price of _aluminum_, reduced from $12 per pound in 1878 to\r\n33 cents now, is due to its production by electrical methods. Among the\r\nearliest successful processes is that described in patents to Cowles and\r\nCowles, No. 319,795, June 9, 1885, and No. 324,658, August 18, 1885, in\r\nwhich a mixture of alumina, carbon and copper is heated to incandescence\r\nby the passage of a current, the reduced aluminum alloying with the\r\ncopper. This has now been superseded by the Hall process (Pat. No.\r\n400,766, April 2, 1889), in which alumina, dissolved in fused cryolite,\r\nis electrolytically decomposed. Practically all the copper now produced,\r\nexcept that from Lake Superior, is refined electrolytically by\r\nsubstantially the method of Farmer’s patent (Pat. No. 322,170, July 14,\r\n1885). All metallic sodium and potassium are now obtained by\r\nelectrolysis of fused hydroxides or chlorides (Pats. No. 452,030, May\r\n12, 1891, to Castner, and No. 541,465, June 25, 1895, to Vautin). The\r\nproduction of caustic soda, sodium carbonate, and chlorine by the\r\nelectrolysis of brine, is carried on upon a large scale, and will\r\nprobably supersede all other methods. Nolf’s process (Pat. No. 271,906,\r\nFeb. 6, 1883), and Caster’s (No. 528,322, Oct. 30, 1894), employ a\r\nreceiving body or cathode of mercury, alternately brought in contact\r\nwith the brine undergoing decomposition, and with water to oxidize the\r\ncontained sodium. _Carborundum_, or silicide of carbon, is largely\r\nsuperseding emery and diamond dust as an abradant. It is produced by\r\nAcheson (Pat. No. 492,767, Feb. 28, 1893), by passing a current of\r\nelectricity through a mixture of silica and carbon. _Calcium carbide_, a\r\nrare compound a few years ago, is now cheaply produced by the action of\r\nan electric arc on a mixture of lime and carbon, as described by Willson\r\n(Pats. Nos. 541,137, 541,138, June 18, 1895). Calcium carbide resembles\r\ncoke in general appearance, and it is used for the manufacture of\r\nacetylene gas, for which purpose it is only necessary to immerse the\r\ncalcium carbide in water, and the gas is at once given off by the mutual\r\ndecomposition of the water and the carbide.\r\n\r\n_Agricultural chemistry_ is another one of the practical developments of\r\nthe Nineteenth Century. A hundred years ago the farmer planted his\r\ncrops, prayed for rain, and trusted to Providence for the increase; he\r\nwas not infrequently disappointed, but was wholly unable to account for\r\nthe failure. To-day the intelligent farmer understands the value of\r\nnitrogen, has ascertained how it may be fed to his crops through the\r\nagency of nitrifying organisms, or he has his soil analyzed at the\r\nAgricultural Department, finds out what element it lacks for the crop\r\ndesired, and in chemically prepared fertilizers supplies that\r\ndeficiency. The chemical analysis of drinking water has also\r\ncontributed much to the knowledge of right living and to the avoidance\r\nof disease and death, which our forefathers were accustomed to regard as\r\ndispensations of Providence.\r\n\r\nAmerica has furnished some eminent chemists in the Nineteenth Century,\r\nwho have made valuable contributions to the science, notably in the\r\nfield of metallurgy. It is a fact, however, which must be admitted with\r\nregret, that America has not in the field of chemical research occupied\r\nthe leading place she has in mechanical progress. The European\r\nlaboratory is the birthplace of most modern inventions in the chemical\r\nfield, and this is so simply by reason of the fact that these more\r\npatient investigators have set themselves studiously, systematically and\r\npersistently to the work of chemical invention. It is said that some of\r\nthe large commercial works in Germany have over 100 Ph. D.’s in a single\r\nmanufacturing establishment, whose work is not directed to the\r\nmanagement of the manufacture, but solely to original research, and the\r\nmaking of inventions. The laboratories in such works differ from those\r\nin the universities only in being more perfectly equipped, and more\r\nsumptuously appointed. The result of this is seen in the fact that in\r\n1899 the United States imported coal tar dyes alone to the extent of\r\n$3,799,353, and 5,227,098 pounds of alizarine, most of which came from\r\nGermany, and for which we paid a good price, since the German\r\nmanufacturers control the United States patents. The alizarine dyes are\r\nfor the most part the artificial kind made by German chemists. Prior to\r\n1869 the red alizarine dye was of plant origin, being obtained from\r\nmadder root, and it cost $2 a pound. The German chemist produced an\r\nartificially made product, which took the place of the madder dye, and\r\nwas sold at $1.20 a pound. At the end of the patent term (seventeen\r\nyears) the price fell to 15c. a pound, showing that the product was\r\nproduced at a profit of more than $1.05 a pound, and as millions of\r\npounds were imported annually, it is estimated that $35,000,000 was the\r\nprice paid the German chemists for their foresight in combining science\r\nwith business. Many United States patents granted to foreign chemists\r\nare still in force, and the rich reward of their skill is reaped at our\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\n_Discovery of elements._--In the early days of chemical knowledge, fire,\r\nair, earth and water constituted the insignificant category of the\r\nelements, which was as faulty in classification as it was small in size.\r\nGradual splitting up of compounds, and an increase in the number of\r\nelements, has gone on progressively for some hundreds of years, until\r\nto-day the list extends well on to one hundred elementary bodies. Those\r\nwhich belong to the credit of the Nineteenth Century are given in the\r\ntable following, with the name of the discoverer, and the date of its\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nELEMENTS DISCOVERED IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n  ELEMENTS.

The classification has the\r\napproval of the present age. What new elements may be found no one may\r\npredict. Mendelejeff’s _periodic law_, however, suggests great\r\npossibilities in this field. Allotropism, in which the same element will\r\npresent entirely different physical aspects, is also a significant and\r\nsuggestive phenomenon, for in it we see carbon appearing at one time as\r\na crude, black and ungainly mass of coal, and at another it appears as\r\nthe limpid and flashing diamond. In more than one mind there is a\r\nlurking suspicion that there may, after all, be only one form of\r\nprimordial matter, from which all others are derived by some wondrous\r\nplay of the atoms, and if so the old idea of the alchemist as to the\r\ntransmutation of metals may not be entirely wrong. The Twentieth Century\r\nmay give us more light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nFOOD AND DRINK.\r\n\r\n    THE NATURE OF FOOD--THE ROLLER MILL--THE MIDDLINGS PURIFIER--\r\n    CULINARY UTENSILS--BREAD MACHINERY--DAIRY APPLIANCES--CENTRIFUGAL\r\n    MILK SKIMMER--THE CANNING INDUSTRY--STERILIZATION--BUTCHERING AND\r\n    DRESSING MEATS--OLEOMARGARINE--MANUFACTURE OF SUGAR--THE VACUUM\r\n    PAN--CENTRIFUGAL FILTER--MODERN DIETETICS AND PATENTED FOODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf called upon to name the most important of all factors of human\r\nexistence, that which underlies and sustains all others, even to life\r\nitself, everyone must agree that it is _food_. A remarkable fact in this\r\nconnection is that all animal life lives and thrives by eating some\r\nother thing that is or has been alive, or is the product of organic\r\ngrowth. The vegetarian may pride himself upon his higher ideals of\r\nliving, but after all his fruit, vegetables, and cereals belong to the\r\ngreat category of living organisms, and are to a certain extent sentient\r\nand conscious, for even the plant will turn to the sun. The beasts of\r\nthe field and fowls of the air live by preying upon other weaker animals\r\nand birds, these upon plants and grasses, and the plants and grasses\r\nupon the decaying mosses and organic mould of the soil, and the mosses\r\nupon still lower organisms. The big fish of the sea eat the little fish,\r\nthe little fish the small fry, and these in turn live upon worms and\r\nanimalcula, and so on all the way down to protoplasm. Omniverous man, in\r\nspite of his boasted civilization and enlightment, not only eats them\r\nall, flesh, fowl, fish, grain and plants, but lives exclusively upon\r\nthem. But he can _only_ live on that which has been produced by the\r\nmysterious agency of life, and this furnishes a significant suggestion\r\nfor the philosopher, for it may be that life itself is only an\r\naccumulated active power or unitary force regenerated in some\r\nmetamorphic way from vital force stored up in the bacteria of organic\r\nfood, and necessarily connected therewith in an endless chain of\r\nreproductions, and if this be true, the hope of the scientist as to the\r\nsynthesis of food from its elements must ever remain a philosophic\r\ndream, because the scientist cannot create a bacterium.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that when a man eats meat he thinks meat, and when he\r\neats bread he thinks bread, and when he eats fruit he thinks fruit. It\r\nis not clear that the quality or character of man’s food is so closely\r\ncorrelated to his thought, but that it has its influence cannot be\r\ndoubted. It would be safer to say, however, that when a man eats meat he\r\nacts meat, and when he eats bread he acts bread, for the muscular energy\r\nand aggressive potentiality appear to be much more closely related to\r\nthe quality of his food than are his thoughts. May it not be that the\r\npowerful achievement of the British Empire was directly related to its\r\nroast beef? Is not the listless apathy of the Chinese due to a diet of\r\nrice? Is not the dominant and masterful power of the lion or the eagle\r\nrelated to a carniverous diet, and the mild and placid temper of the ox\r\nthe reflex expression of his vegetable food? It is quite true that our\r\npotentialities are largely represented by what we eat, and our food\r\ntherefore becomes a most interesting topic, not only by virtue of its\r\nindispensable quality, but by reason also of the possibilities of\r\ndevelopment in the betterment and elevation of the human race.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times even down to the present day man’s food has been\r\nthe same--flesh, fish, cereals, fruits and vegetables. The development\r\nof the present century has not extended this category, but it has been\r\ndirected to an increase in the supply, an improvement in quality, the\r\npreservation against decay and waste, and its intelligent selection and\r\nadaptation to the special needs of the body. Progress manifests itself\r\nin the great field of agriculture, in improved processes and machines\r\nfor milling; in butchering, packing and handling meats; in preserving\r\nand drying fruits; in the preparation of canned goods, in dairy\r\nappliances, in cake and cracker machines; in the manufacture of sugar;\r\nin the great advance in cookery; in the science of dietetics, and in\r\nthousands of minor industries.\r\n\r\nIn agriculture the raising of grain has extended in the Nineteenth\r\nCentury to enormous proportions. More than ten thousand patents for\r\nplows, as many for reapers, and a proportionate number of planters,\r\ncultivators, threshers, and other implements and tools represent the\r\nextent to which inventive genius has been directed to the increase of\r\nthe yield in the harvest field.\r\n\r\nThis yield in the United States for the year 1898 was:\r\n\r\n  Corn         1,924,184,660 bushels\r\n  Wheat          675,148,705 bushels\r\n  Oats           730,906,643 bushels\r\n  Rye             25,657,522 bushels\r\n  Barley          55,792,257 bushels\r\n  Buckwheat       11,721,927 bushels\r\n  Potatoes       192,306,338 bushels\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 164.--ROLLER PROCESS OF MAKING FLOUR, WEGMANN’S\r\nPATENT.]\r\n\r\nFor converting the grain into flour, the inventors of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury have made revolutionary changes. Milling processes within the\r\nlast twenty-five years have been completely transformed by the\r\nintroduction of the roller mill and middlings purifier. Formerly two\r\nhorizontal disk-shaped stones or burrs were employed, the lower one\r\nstationary and the upper one revolving in a horizontal plane and crudely\r\ncrushing the grain between them. In all modern mills these have been\r\nentirely displaced by porcelain rolls revolving on horizontal axes and\r\ncrushing the grain between them. The first of these roller mills is\r\nshown in pat. No. 182,250, to Wegmann, Sept. 12, 1876. (See Fig. 164).\r\nThe outer rolls _d e_ are pressed against the inner ones _a c_ by a\r\nsystem of weighted levers, and scrapers below remove the crushed grain\r\nfrom the periphery of the rolls. Many subsequent improvements have been\r\nmade, one type of which employs a succession of rolls which act in pairs\r\non the grain one after the other and reduce it by successive gradations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 165.--MIDDLINGS PURIFIER.]\r\n\r\nThe _middlings purifier_, see Fig. 165, comprehends a flat bolt or\r\nshaker screen _b_, of bolting cloth, arranged as a horizontal partition\r\nin an enclosing case through which passes an upward draft of air\r\nproduced by suction fan D at the top. This air passing up through the\r\nbolting screen lifts the bran specks and fuzz from the shaken material\r\nas it passes downward through the screen, brushes K being arranged below\r\nto keep the screen constantly clean. A representative and pioneer type\r\nof this machine is seen in Pat. No. 164,050 to George T. Smith, June 1,\r\n1875, from which the view is taken. The useful effect of the roller mill\r\nand middlings purifier is to save the most nutritious and valuable part\r\nof the grain, which lies between the outer cuticle and the white starch\r\nwithin, and which breaks up in fine grains and is of a golden hue. This\r\nportion of the grain was formerly unseparated, and was mixed with the\r\nmiddlings and bran as an inferior product. Modern analysis has disclosed\r\nits superior food value, and the roller mill and middlings purifier have\r\nprovided means by which it can be separated from the bran and\r\nincorporated with the flour, thereby greatly adding to its wholesome\r\ncharacter and nutritive value, and imparting to the flour the rich\r\ncreamy tint which characterizes all higher grades.\r\n\r\nMinneapolis, Minn., is the great center of the milling interests of the\r\nUnited States. The Pillsbury Mills are located there, and the “Pillsbury\r\nA.” which is said to be the largest in the world, has a capacity of\r\n7,000 barrels per day.\r\n\r\nIn 1877-78 disastrous flour dust explosions at Minneapolis brought\r\nabout the development of the dust collector, for withdrawing from the\r\nair of the mills the suspended particles of flour dust, which not only\r\ninvited explosion, but rendered the air unfit to breathe. Washburn’s\r\nPat. No. 213,151, March 11, 1879, is an early example.\r\n\r\nThe use of crushing rolls has also developed a great variety of new\r\nfoods, such as cracked wheat, oatmeal grits, etc. These crushing rolls\r\nhave sometimes been made hollow, and are steam heated, and as they crush\r\nthe grain they simultaneously effect the cooking or partial conversion\r\nof the starch, and the product is known as hominy flake, ceraline,\r\ncoralline, etc., which furnish popular breakfast foods when served with\r\ncream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 166.--DOUGH MIXER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 167.--BRAKE, OR KNEADING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nIn the field of cookery such activity has been displayed that the\r\naverage kitchen to-day is a veritable museum of modern inventions. Egg\r\nbeaters, waffle irons, toasters, broilers, baking pans, apple parers,\r\ncherry stoners, cheese cutters, butter workers, coffee mills, corn\r\npoppers, cream freezers, dish washers, egg boilers, flour sifters, flat\r\nirons, knife sharpeners, can openers, lemon squeezers, potato mashers,\r\nmeat boilers, nutmeg graters, sausage grinders, and frying pans in\r\nendless array; all patented and clustered around the modern cooking\r\nrange as a central figure, and all presenting points of excellence in\r\nthe matter of economy and convenience, or the betterment of result. The\r\nmost extensive application of inventive genius is to be found in the\r\nlarge manufacturing bakeries, which make and sell the millions of pounds\r\nof crackers and cakes that fill the bins and shelves of the grocery\r\nstore. In these manufactories the dough is prepared by a mixer, see Fig.\r\n166, which consists of a spiral working blade revolving in a trough, and\r\ncapable of handling half a dozen barrels of flour at a time. It is then\r\nput through a kneading machine, called a “brake,” shown in Fig. 167, and\r\nis then ready to be converted into crackers or cakes on a great machine\r\n25 feet long, which finishes the crackers and puts them in the pan ready\r\nfor the oven. This machine, see Fig. 168, receives the dough at A, where\r\nit is coated with flour and flattened into a sheet between rolls. It is\r\nthen received on a traveling apron B, has the flour brushed off by a\r\nrotary brush C, and is then cut into crackers or cakes by vertically\r\nreciprocating dies D. At E a series of fingers press the cakes down\r\nthrough the sheet of dough, while the surrounding scraps are raised on a\r\nbelt F and delivered into a suitable receptacle. The separated cakes at\r\nB′ are then delivered into pans at G, the pans being fed on the\r\nsubjacent belt at G′. Such machines, costing nearly a thousand dollars,\r\nproduce from forty to sixty barrels of crackers a day, enabling them to\r\nbe sold at about 5 cents a pound at retail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 168.--CRACKER AND CAKE MACHINE.]\r\n\r\n_Dairy Appliances_ have come in for a large share of attention at the\r\nhands of the Nineteenth Century inventor. There are about sixteen\r\nmillion milch cows in the United States, and their contribution to the\r\nfood stuffs of the day in milk, butter, and cheese is no insignificant\r\nfactor. There have been over 2,700 patents granted for churns alone, and\r\nbesides these there are milk coolers, cheese presses, milk skimmers, and\r\neven cow milkers. The centrifugal milk skimmer is an interesting type of\r\nthis class of machine. In the old way the milk was set for the cream to\r\nrise, which it did slowly from its lighter specific gravity. In the\r\ncentrifugal skimmer the milk is continuously poured in through a funnel,\r\nand the cream runs out continuously through one spout, and the skimmed\r\nmilk at the other. An illustrative type of this machine is shown in\r\nFig. 169. A steam turbine wheel near the base turns a vertical shaft\r\nbearing at its upper end a pan which rotates within the outer case. The\r\nmilk enters through the faucet at the top, and as the pan within\r\nrotates, the heavier milk, by its greater specific gravity, is thrown to\r\nthe outer part of the pan and passes out through the larger of the two\r\nspouts, while the lighter cream is crowded to the center and passes out\r\nof the upper spout, which opens into the center of the pan. Patents to\r\nLefeldt & Lentsch, No. 195,515, Sept. 25, 1877, and Houston and Thomson,\r\nNo. 239,659, April 5, 1881, represent pioneer milk skimmers of this\r\ntype.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 169.--CENTRIFUGAL MILK SKIMMER.]\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the dairy appliances are the incubator and the bee\r\nhive, both of which have claimed a large share of attention, and for\r\nwhich many patents have been granted.\r\n\r\nOne important and characteristic feature of the present age is the\r\nconservation of waste in perishable foodstuffs. Fruits, vegetables, fish\r\nand oysters were suitable food to our forefathers only when freshly\r\ntaken, and any superabundance in supply was either wasted by natural\r\nprocesses of decay, or was fed to the hogs. To-day thousands of patented\r\nfruit dryers, cider mills, and preserving processes save this waste and\r\ncarry over for valuable use through the unproductive winter months these\r\nwholesome and valuable articles of diet. Even more important is the\r\n_canning industry_, by which not only fruits are maintained in a\r\npractically fresh condition for an indefinite time, but oysters, meats,\r\nfish, soups, and vegetables are also put up in enormous quantities.\r\nTo-day the grocer’s shelves present an endless array of canned tomatoes,\r\npeaches, corn, peas, beans, fish, oysters, condensed milk, and potted\r\nmeats, which constitute probably three-fourths of his staple goods. The\r\ntin can is in itself a very insignificant thing, not entitled to rank\r\nwith any of the great inventions, but in the every-day campaign of life\r\nit is playing its part, and working its influence to an extent that is\r\nlittle dreamed of by the casual observer. It renders possible our\r\nmilitary and exploring expeditions; it holds famine and starvation in\r\nabeyance; it gives wholesome variety to the diet of both rich and poor;\r\nand it transfers the glut of the full season to the want of future days.\r\nPerhaps no single factor of modern life has so great an economic value.\r\nSimple as is the tin can, quite complex machines are required to make\r\nit. Originally such machines were operated by hand or foot power, but\r\nwithin the last 25 years power machines have been devised which\r\nautomatically convert a simple blank or plate of sheet metal into a\r\nfinished can. Of the many patents granted for such machines the most\r\nrepresentative ones are 243,287, 250,096, 267,014, 384,825, 450,624,\r\n465,018, 480,256, 495,426, 489,484.\r\n\r\nIn the process of putting up canned goods the products are filled into\r\nthe cans, and the caps, or heads, are soldered on. These caps have a\r\nminute hole in the center for the escape of air and steam in the process\r\nof cooking and sterilizing, which is conducted as follows: A large\r\nnumber of cans are placed on a tray swung from a crane and the cans\r\nlowered into one of a series of great cooking boilers. The cover of the\r\nboiler is then closed and fastened by lugs, and steam turned on until\r\nthe goods in the can are thoroughly heated through. During this process\r\nthe air and steam escape through the little vent hole from the interior\r\nof each can. The cans are then removed, the vent hole closed by a drop\r\nof solder, and the goods thus hermetically sealed in a cooked or\r\nsterilized condition will keep for a long period of time.\r\n\r\n_Sterilizing._--During the last quarter of the century, which has\r\nwitnessed the growth of the wonderful science of bacteriology, a class\r\nof devices known as sterilizers has come into existence, whose primary\r\nfunction is to kill the germs of decay by heat. This has had in the\r\ncanning industry an important commercial application. An example is\r\nfound in the patent to Shriver, No. 149,256, March 31, 1874. In some of\r\nthese devices the receptacles containing the food stuffs are in large\r\nnumbers placed within the heating chamber, and by devices operated from\r\nthe outside the cans or bottles are opened and shut while within the\r\nsteam filled chamber. A late illustration is found in patent to Popp _et\r\nal._, 524,649, August 14, 1894.\r\n\r\n_Butchering and Dressing Meats._--Chicago is the leading city of the\r\nworld in this industry, and Armour & Co. the largest packers. In the\r\nyear ending April 1, 1891, they killed and dressed 1,714,000 hogs,\r\n712,000 cattle, and 413,000 sheep. They had 7,900 employees, and 2,250\r\nrefrigerating cars were employed for the transportation of their\r\nproducts. The ground area covered by their buildings was fifty acres,\r\ngiving a floor area of 140 acres, a chill room and cold storage area of\r\nforty acres, and a storage capacity of 130,000 tons. In addition to its\r\nmeat packing business the firm has separate glue works, with buildings\r\ncovering fifteen acres, where 600 hands are employed, their production\r\nin 1890 being 7,000,000 pounds of glue, and 9,500 tons of fertilizer.\r\nSince 1891 this great business has increased until to-day it is said\r\nthat the army of workmen employed is greater than that of Xenophon, that\r\nthe firm pays out in wages alone, half a million dollars every month,\r\nthat four thousand cars are required to carry the products of their\r\nfactory, and whose business amounts to the enormous sum of one hundred\r\nmillion dollars annually.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 170.--KILLING AND DRESSING PORK.]\r\n\r\nThere are from forty to fifty million cattle raised in the United\r\nStates, and an equal amount of sheep. The number of hogs raised has\r\ndiminished somewhat in the past few years, but from 1889 to 1892 more\r\nthan fifty million were maintained. The process of slaughtering and\r\ndressing pork, as practiced to-day, is a continuous one, and is well\r\nillustrated in Fig. 170, in 13 operations. The animals are driven into a\r\ncatching pen at 1, where they are strung up by one leg, and secured to a\r\ntraveling pulley on an overhead rail. At 2 the animal is instantly\r\nkilled by a knife thrust that reaches the heart; at 3 he is dumped into\r\na vat of scalding water, kept hot by steam pipes, where the hair is\r\nloosened (see detail view Fig. 171). A series of oscillating curved\r\narms, shaped like a horse hay-rake, dips the carcass out of the scalding\r\nvat and deposits it upon the table 4 (Fig. 170), where it is attached to\r\nan endless cable that drags it through a scraping machine at 5. This\r\ntakes off the hair, as shown in detail view Fig. 172. At 6 (Fig. 170)\r\nthe remnants of hair are removed by hand, and at 7 the skin is washed\r\nclean. At 8 the carcass is inspected, and the throat cut across; at 9\r\nthe entrails are removed; at 10 the leaf lard is taken out; at 11 the\r\nheads are severed and tongues removed; at 12 the carcass is split into\r\nhalves, and at 13 the sections are ready to be run into the cooling\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 171.--SCALDING TO LOOSEN THE HAIR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 172.--SCRAPING OFF THE HAIR BY MACHINERY.]\r\n\r\nFrom 10 to 15 minutes only are required to convert the living animal\r\ninto dressed pork. Every part of the animal is utilized. The lungs,\r\nheart, liver and trimmings go to the sausage department. The feet are\r\npickled or converted into glue. The intestines are stripped and\r\ncleaned for sausage casings. The soft parts of the head are made into\r\nso-called cheese, and the fat is rendered into lard. The finer quality\r\nof bristles goes to the brushmakers, and the balance is used by\r\nupholsterers for mixing with horse hair. The blood is largely used for\r\nmaking albumen for photographic uses, as well as in sugar refining, for\r\nmeat extracts, and for fertilizers. The bones are ground for fertilizer,\r\nand even the tank waters are concentrated and used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n_Oleomargarine._--About 1868 M. Mege, a French chemist, commissioned by\r\nhis government to investigate certain questions of domestic economy, was\r\nled into the study of beef fat, and to make comparisons of the same with\r\nbutter. He found that when cows were deprived of food containing fat\r\nthey still continued to give milk yielding cream or fatty products. He\r\ntherefore concluded that the stored-up fat in the animal was then\r\nconverted into cream, and that it was practicable, therefore, to convert\r\nbeef fat into butter fat. Physiology taught that in the living animal\r\nthe change was wrought through the withdrawal of the larger part of the\r\nstearine by respiratory combustion, while the oleomargarine was secreted\r\nby the milk glands, and its conversion into butyric oleomargarine\r\neffected in the udder under the influence of the mammary pepsin. In the\r\nprocess of making butter by the ordinary method of churning the cream,\r\nthe finely divided butter fat globules are united into masses,\r\ncontaining by mechanical admixture from 12 to 14 per cent. of water or\r\nbuttermilk carrying a fractional per cent. of cheese. This buttermilk\r\ncontributes somewhat to the flavor, but at the same time furnishes a\r\nferment which ultimately spoils the butter by making it rancid. It is a\r\npurely accidental ingredient, and one not at all desirable. To some\r\nextent the same may be said of the soluble fats which give to the butter\r\nits variable though characteristic flavor. They are unstable compounds,\r\ndecomposing readily, and furnish the acrid products which make “strong”\r\nbutter. M. Mege sought to imitate the natural process of butter-making,\r\nwhich was first to separate from the oily fat of suet the cellular\r\ntissue and excess of stearine or hard fat; second, to add to the oil a\r\nsufficient proportion of butyric compounds to give the necessary flavor,\r\nand third, to consolidate the butter fat without grain, and to add at\r\nthe same time the requisite proportion of water, salt, and coloring\r\nmatter, to make a compound substantially the same in composition,\r\nflavor, and appearance, as butter churned from the cream, and all this\r\nwithout adding to the original fat anything dietetically objectionable,\r\nand without submitting it to any process capable of impairing its\r\nwholesome quality. These objects were fairly obtained in the product\r\nknown as oleomargarine, the United States patent for which was granted\r\nto Mege Dec. 30, 1873, No. 146,012.\r\n\r\nThe process in brief is to take fresh beef fat, which is first chopped\r\nup and thoroughly washed. It is then placed in melting tanks at a\r\ntemperature of 122° to 124° F, and the clear yellow oil is drawn off and\r\nallowed to stand until it granulates. The fat is then packed in cloths\r\nset in moulds and a slowly increasing pressure squeezes out the pure\r\namber colored oil, leaving the stearine behind. This sweet and pure\r\nyellow oil is then churned with milk for 20 minutes until the oil is\r\ncompletely broken up, and a small quantity of annato, a vegetable\r\ncoloring matter, is added to give a yellow color. The product is then\r\ncooled in ice, and after a second churning with milk it is salted and\r\nfinished like butter. Chemical analysis shows oleomargarine to have\r\nsubstantially the same constituents and in almost the identical\r\nproportions of pure butter. It is equally wholesome, and while it does\r\nnot have the same rich flavor, it has the advantage that it keeps\r\nbetter, and is not so liable to become rancid or strong. The\r\noleomargarine industry is closely related to the beef packing industries\r\nof the United States, and its growth has been enormous. Notwithstanding\r\nthe stringent laws on the subject, much of the oleomargarine made is\r\nsold for, and by the average purchaser is not distinguishable from, pure\r\nbutter. In 1899 there were 80,495,628 pounds of oleomargarine made in\r\nthe United States, or more than a pound for every man, woman, and child\r\nin the country. The internal revenue tax paid on it was $1,609,912.56.\r\nThe exports for the year 1899 were 5,549,322 pounds of the artificial\r\nbutter, and 142,390,492 pounds of the oleo oil prepared for conversion\r\ninto the complete product by simply churning with milk.\r\n\r\n_Sugar._--Sugar-cane, beets, and the sap of the maple constitute the\r\nsources from which sugar is extracted, but the cane furnishes by far the\r\nlargest supply. When crushed between rolls it yields 65 per cent. of its\r\nweight as juice, and 18 per cent. of this juice is sugar. It is\r\nconcentrated by evaporation at a low temperature, the crystallized\r\nportion being known as “raw” or brown sugar, which is subsequently\r\nrefined, while the uncrystallized portion forms molasses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 173.--VACUUM PAN FOR EVAPORATING THE SYRUP TO\r\nPRODUCE SUGAR.]\r\n\r\nIn the process of refining, 2 or 3 parts of raw sugar, with one of water\r\ncontaining a little lime, ground bone black, and the serum of bullocks’\r\nblood, is heated by the passage of steam through it. The albumen of the\r\nserum coagulates and rises to the surface in a scum which entangles the\r\nimpurities and bone black, leaving the syrup light in color. The latter\r\nis then filtered through bone black until it is colorless and is then\r\nevaporated in the vacuum pan, which is the important invention of the\r\ncentury in sugar making. Heat has the effect of converting the\r\ncrystallized sugar into the uncrystallized variety, and hence the\r\nevaporation must, to prevent this, be conducted at a low temperature.\r\nContact with the air is also objectionable. These conditions are\r\nprovided for by conducting the evaporation in a vacuum, which lowers the\r\nevaporating temperature and avoids contact with the air. The vacuum pan\r\nwas the invention of Howard, an Englishman. (British Pat. No. 3,754, of\r\n1813). As constructed to-day it is an enormous vessel (see Fig. 173),\r\ncapable of holding 7,000 or more gallons, and yielding 250 barrels of\r\nsugar at a strike. In this a vacuum is maintained by a condenser, the\r\nvapors passing from the pan to the condenser through the great curved\r\npipe rising from the top, which pipe is five feet in diameter. A gentle\r\nheat is applied through internal steam-heated coils which connect with\r\nan external series of steam inlet pipes on one side, and a corresponding\r\nseries of steam outlet pipes on the other. A large discharge valve for\r\nthe concentrated syrup closes the bottom of the pan. After concentration\r\nthe crystallized sugar is separated from the syrup by a centrifugal\r\nfilter, in which the liquid is thrown from the crystallized sugar by\r\ncentrifugal action. The first centrifugal filter is shown in British\r\npatent to Joshua Bates, No. 6,068, of 1831. This, however, revolved\r\nabout a horizontal axis. The present form of centrifugal filter is a\r\ncylinder revolving about a vertical axis, the sides of the cylinder\r\nbeing formed of filtering medium, through which the liquid is thrown by\r\ncentrifugal action, while the sugar is retained within. This was the\r\ninvention of Joseph Hurd, of Mass., U. S. Pat. No. 3,772, Oct. 3, 1844;\r\nre-issue No. 607, Sept. 29, 1858, which patent was extended for seven\r\nyears, from Oct. 3, 1858. The diffusion process, which extracts the\r\njuice by cutting the cane in slices and soaking in water; the bagasse\r\nfurnace, which dries and burns the expressed cane stalks as fuel, and\r\nthe manufacture of glucose and grape sugar by the reaction of sulphuric\r\nacid on starch, are interesting allied features of this industry which\r\ncan only be briefly mentioned. Most of the sugar consumed in the United\r\nStates is imported, much raw sugar being imported and refined here. The\r\nimports for the year 1899 were 3,980,250,569 pounds, and the per capita\r\nconsumption in 1898 was 61.1 pounds a year.\r\n\r\n_Aids to Digestion._--It is only during the last part of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury that the world has learned how to live. “What is one man’s food\r\nis another man’s poison” has been a trite old saying for many years, but\r\nthe reason why has only in late years been fully understood. The\r\nphysiology of digestion, the relative digestibility of different\r\narticles of food, and their nutritive values, have received of late\r\nyears the earnest attention of physicians and students of dietetics and\r\nhave contributed much to the quality and kind of food, and a knowledge\r\nof when and how to eat it. We know that the starchy foods are digested\r\nby the saliva, which is an alkaline digestion; that meat, fish, eggs,\r\ncheese and the albumenoids are digested in the stomach by the gastric\r\njuices (pepsin and hydrochloric acid) which is an acid digestion, and\r\nthat the remaining portions of starch, the sugars, and fats are digested\r\nin the intestines, and that this is also an alkaline digestion, and this\r\nhas helped to solve the problem for us. We also know that starch is an\r\nexcellent food, provided the vital powers are sufficiently stimulated by\r\nfresh air, sunlight, and exercise to digest it, as do the horse and the\r\nox when they eat corn, but we know furthermore that the sedentary\r\noccupations of modern life leave many stomachs in a condition unable to\r\nassimilate starch, and so bread, oatmeal, potatoes and such simple\r\nstaples, instead of nourishing the body, ferment in the enfeebled\r\nstomach, produce acids and gas, and lay the foundation for serious\r\nchronic diseases. The student of chemistry and dietetics knows to-day\r\nthat one part of diastase will effect the conversion of 2,000 parts of\r\nstarch into grape sugar, as a preliminary step to its digestion, and so\r\nby treating starchy matter with substances containing diastase (derived\r\nfrom malt) a partial transformation is effected which will materially\r\nshorten and assist its digestion. This fact has been largely made use of\r\nin the preparation of easily soluble or pre-digested foods, examples of\r\nwhich are found in patent to Horlick (malted milk), No. 278,967, June 5,\r\n1883; to Carnrick (milk-wheat food), Dec. 27, 1887, No. 375,601; and\r\nBoynton and Van Patten (cereals and diastase), 344,717, June 29, 1886.\r\n\r\n_Beverages._--Pure water, nature’s own gift, has ever supplied every\r\nlegitimate need of the human race, but civilized life has greatly\r\nextended its list of drinks, much to its own detriment. Soda water,\r\nwhiskey, beer, ginger ale, tea, coffee, and chocolate represent enormous\r\nindustries, and probably all do more harm than they do good. Much\r\ninventive genius in the Nineteenth Century has been bestowed upon the\r\nsoda water fountain, on stills, and processes for aging liquors and\r\nprocesses for brewing beer, on cider and wine presses, on bottling\r\nmachines and bottle stoppers, on devices for carbonating waters, and in\r\ncoffee and teapots. The trend of the times is shown in the following\r\nfigures, which represent the per capita consumption of beverages in the\r\nUnited States for 1898: tea, .91 of a pound; coffee, 11.45 pounds;\r\nwines, .28 of a gallon; distilled spirits, 1.10 gallons; and malt\r\nliquors 15.64 gallons. The largest per capita increase since 1870 has\r\nbeen in malt liquors, and the next in coffee. In tea and distilled\r\nspirits there has been a decrease, while the consumption of wines is the\r\nsmallest of all and has varied but little.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nMEDICINE, SURGERY, SANITATION.\r\n\r\n    DISCOVERY OF CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD BY HARVEY--VACCINATION BY\r\n    JENNER--USE OF ANÆSTHETICS THE GREAT STEP OF MEDICAL PROGRESS OF THE\r\n    CENTURY--MATERIA MEDICA--INSTRUMENTS--SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE--DENTISTRY\r\n    --ARTIFICIAL LIMBS--DIGESTION--BACTERIOLOGY, AND DISEASE GERMS--\r\n    ANTISEPTIC SURGERY--HOUSE SANITATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early gropings through the uncertain light of first progress, man\r\nwas accustomed to ascribe the ills of his flesh to the anger of the\r\ngods, and in his craven and abject superstition made peace offerings.\r\nLater he learned to locate the cause within himself, and constructed the\r\ntheory that the fluids of the body had become disordered. The\r\ncharacteristic feature of progress in the Nineteenth Century, in this\r\nfield, has been in the accurate tracing of the relation of cause and\r\neffect, and with the discovery of true causes has grown efficient means\r\nof treatment. The old expedients of charms, incantations, conjuration\r\nand exorcism gave place first to intelligent medication, and this in\r\nturn is rapidly giving way to the prevention of disease by improved\r\nconditions of sanitation and right living. The ounce of prevention has\r\nbeen found to be worth more than the pound of cure. With the improved\r\nknowledge of physiology, anatomy, chemistry and biology, which the\r\ncentury has brought, the intelligent physician was able to make a\r\nlogical and for the most part a correct diagnosis, but supplemented with\r\nthe microscope, that great revealer of the unseen world of small things,\r\ncorporeal existence itself becomes an open book, and from the principles\r\nof organic evolution to the germ theory of disease the mystery of life\r\nand death is being slowly revealed.\r\n\r\nWhen the Eighteenth Century gave birth to the Nineteenth, its great\r\nnatal gift in medicine was vaccination. Jenner in 1798 for the first\r\ntime announced his discovery of this great boon to the human race. In\r\n1799 Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse, in Boston, obtained virus from Jenner and\r\nvaccinated four of his children, and in 1801 Dr. Valentine Seaman\r\nobtained virus from Dr. Waterhouse and performed the first vaccination\r\nin New York. During the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries the annual\r\ndeath rate from smallpox in London ranged from 2 to 4 per 1,000 of\r\npopulation. In 1892 it was only 0.073 per 1,000.\r\n\r\nIt is also stated on good authority that the mortality from smallpox in\r\nEngland alone, was 20,000 a year less after the introduction of\r\nvaccination than it was in the preceding century, and that its benefits\r\nto the world at large have been so great that the lancet of Jenner has\r\nsaved more lives than were sacrificed by the sword of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nEach century in modern history has been marked by some important\r\ndiscovery in the field of medicine. The Seventeenth Century was notable\r\nfor the discovery of the circulation of the blood by Harvey; the\r\nEighteenth Century brought with it vaccination by Jenner. The Nineteenth\r\nCentury’s greatest gift in this field has been anæsthesia, or\r\ninsensibility to pain. Nature has wisely endowed man with nerves of\r\nsensation as danger signals for the conservation of life. Accident and\r\ndisease, however, are the inseparable concomitants of human existence,\r\nand suffering and pain the ineffaceable legacies of mortality. Sometimes\r\nthese nerves of sensation are no longer useful as monitors, and in the\r\nunavoidable emergency of accident, surgical operations, child birth, and\r\ncertain diseases, suffering can do no good, and then pain--that Prince\r\nof Terrors--thrusting his presence upon the hapless victim, racks body\r\nand limb, calling forth groans, and shrieks and writhings, till the poor\r\nsufferer, possessed with a dominating agony which displaces all thought\r\nof life, memory of friends, and love of God, breaks down in unutterable\r\ndistress, and prays for death and oblivion. To this poor sufferer\r\ninsensibility is next to heaven. For the past half century all the\r\nformidable operations of the surgeon have been performed with the aid of\r\nanæsthetics and without suffering to the patient, producing happy\r\nrecoveries, and greatly contributing to the success of the result by\r\nrelieving the surgeon of the distraction of the patient’s pain, and the\r\ninterference of his involuntary movements. Quite a number of anæsthetics\r\nare known and used to-day. Those more generally employed are--naming\r\nthem in the order of their first application--nitrous oxide gas, ether,\r\nand chloroform. Nitrous oxide gas is chiefly used for the extraction of\r\nteeth. Sir Humphrey Davy, in 1800, was the first to observe the peculiar\r\nquality of nitrous oxide gas, which gave it the name of “laughing gas,”\r\nfrom the fact that it caused those inhaling it to act in a manner\r\nexhibiting an abnormal exhilaration. Dr. Horace Wells, a dentist of\r\nHartford, Conn., in 1844, had the gas administered, experimentally, to\r\nhimself during the operation of extracting a tooth, and was the\r\ndiscoverer of its useful application as an anæsthetic.\r\n\r\nThe greatest discovery, however, in anæsthetics is the application of\r\nether for this purpose. Ether as a chemical product has been known for\r\nseveral centuries, and as early as 1818 Faraday pointed out the\r\nsimilarity between the effects of ether and nitrous oxide gas. Dr.\r\nMorton, a dentist, of Boston, first applied it as an anæsthetic Oct. 16,\r\n1846, being guided largely in its selection and use by Dr. Jackson, an\r\neminent chemist of the same city. On Nov. 12, 1846, U. S. Pat. No. 4,848\r\nwas issued to them for this invention. In the latter part of December of\r\nthe same year Dr. Liston, an eminent English surgeon, performed the\r\noperation of amputating the thigh while the patient was under the\r\ninfluence of ether.\r\n\r\nChloroform, discovered by Guthrie in 1831, was first applied as an\r\nanæsthetic by Sir James Y. Simpson, of Edinburgh, in 1847. Of the two\r\nleading anæsthetics, ether is more generally used in the United Sates\r\nand chloroform in Europe. Ether is less dangerous, but its\r\nadministration is more difficult and disagreeable. It is said on the\r\nhighest authority that in the Crimean War chloroform was administered\r\n25,000 times without a single death, and ether is even safer than\r\nchloroform. In the hands of a skillful physician practically no danger\r\nis to be apprehended from the use of either of the two agents. A little\r\nover fifty years ago any severe or prolonged surgical operation involved\r\nsuch irresistible pain that the patient’s writhings were required to be\r\nrestrained by powerful muscular assistants, and by straps which bound\r\nthe patient to the table, and when it is remembered that a false cut of\r\na hundredth part of an inch might be fatal, the haste, the disquieting\r\ninfluence upon the surgeon, and the interference with the accuracy of\r\nhis hand, added greatly to the percentage of unsuccessful operations, as\r\nwell as to the prolonged agony of the patient. Contrast this with the\r\npresent methods of using anæsthetics, and we find the patient dropping\r\ninto a quiet and peaceful sleep before the operation, and awakening\r\nthereafter to find, to his astonishment, that it is all over, and that\r\nrecovery is only a question of careful nursing.\r\n\r\n_Materia Medica._--Many important contributions have been made to the\r\npharmacopœia in the century. In 1807 the remedy known as ergot was\r\nbrought to the notice of the profession by Dr. Stearns, and named by him\r\npulvis parturiens. Iodine was first used as a medicine in 1819 by Dr.\r\nCoindet, Sr., of Geneva. Quinine was discovered by Pelletier and\r\nCaventou in 1820, although Peruvian bark had long been used for the same\r\npurpose. Chloral hydrate, discovered by Liebig in 1832, was applied in\r\nmedicine in 1869 by Dr. Liebreich, of Berlin. Carbolic acid was\r\ndiscovered in 1834 by Runge. Artificial seidlitz powders were first put\r\nup under Savory’s British Pat. No. 3,954, of 1815. Veratrum viride,\r\nlobelia, worm seed, and chloroform were all introduced in the first part\r\nof the century. The sulphates of morphia, strychnia, atropia and other\r\nalkaloids are of comparatively recent addition to the pharmacopœia, and\r\nthe iodide of potash, tincture of iron, digitalis, bichloride of\r\nmercury, sub-nitrate of bismuth, boracic acid and gallic acid, chlorate\r\nof potash and Dover’s powders have become standard remedies within a\r\nhundred years. In the latter part of the century the new remedies\r\nderived from coal tar have occupied an important place. Of these may be\r\nmentioned antipyrine, by Knorr (pat. Oct. 28, 1884), phenacetin, by\r\nHinsberg (pat. March 26, 1889), salol, by Von Nencki (pat. Sept. 28,\r\n1886), sulfonal, by Bauman (patented Jan. 22, 1889), antikamnia\r\n(acetanilide), and many others, besides new and valuable antiseptic\r\ncompounds, such as salicylic acid and formalin. A characteristic feature\r\nof the modern practice of medicine is in improved forms of its\r\nadministration. Sugar-coated pills, gelatine capsules and cod liver oil\r\nemulsions make the remedy much less disagreeable to take, and very\r\ningenious and effective machines have been devised for putting up\r\nremedies in such forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 174.--THE OPHTHALMOMETER.]\r\n\r\n_Instruments._--Laennec’s discovery in 1819 of auscultation, and the\r\nstethoscope, for determining internal conditions by sound, was a great\r\nstep in diagnosing diseases. The binaural stethoscope was invented by\r\nCammann in 1854, and a later improvement is the phonendoscope, by\r\nBianchi. The opthalmoscope is an instrument for inspecting the interior\r\nof the eye, which was invented by Prof. Helmholtz, and described by him\r\nin 1851. The laryngoscope, for obtaining a view of the larynx, was said\r\nto have been constructed by Mr. John Avery, of London, as early as 1846.\r\nThe opthalmometer, Fig. 174, is a comparatively recent invention. It is\r\ndesigned to ascertain variations in corneal curvature for the correction\r\nof corneal astigmatism. Electric lights with reflectors are arranged on\r\neach side of the patient’s head, while the operator looks into the eye\r\nwith a telescope. The sphygmograph, a little instrument to be strapped\r\non to the wrist to record the action of the pulse, was first reduced to\r\na practically useful form by Marey in 1860. A later development of these\r\ndevices, by Verdin, known as the sphygmometrograph, is shown in Fig.\r\n175. The endoscope, for looking into the urethra, and the cystoscope,\r\nfor looking into the bladder, are other useful instruments of the modern\r\npractitioner. Greater than them all, however, is the modern X-ray\r\napparatus, for locating foreign substances in the body and making\r\nvisible the bones through the flesh, for which see special chapter. The\r\nuse of the thermometer in recording the progress of fevers is also a\r\nvaluable modern application, and the list of instruments and small tools\r\nis beyond enumeration. There are series of obstetrical appliances,\r\ninstruments relating to bone surgery, to the taking up of arteries,\r\ncupping instruments, trepanning instruments, speculums, hypodermic\r\nsyringes, electric cauteries, fracture appliances, instruments for\r\nlithotrity, bandages for varicose veins, atomizers, breast pumps,\r\ninhalers, nasal douches, trusses, pessaries, catheters, abdominal\r\nsupporters, and an endless variety of proprietary articles, such as\r\nelectric baths and belts, plasters, chest protectors, liver pads, and so\r\nforth, all of which are practically the products of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury. The surgeon of to-day can straighten the eyes of a cross-eyed\r\nman, or take the bow out of his bandy legs, can make him a new nose of\r\nhis own flesh, patch his skull with a silver plate, remove the stone\r\nfrom his bladder, supply him with a wind-pipe, wash out his stomach, and\r\nperform many other operations even more difficult. Among such more\r\nimportant operations may be mentioned ovariotomy, which was first\r\nperformed by Dr. Ephraim McDowell, of Danville, Kentucky, in 1809, and\r\nthe tying of the great arteries. The operation of lithotrity, for\r\nremoving stone from the bladder by crushing the stone, was introduced by\r\nCiviale, 1817-1824, who devised successful instruments and modes of\r\nusing them. In 1836 to 1840 Richard Bright, an English physician, made\r\nimportant researches and discoveries in relation to the functions and\r\ndiseases of the kidneys, and established the nature of the so-called\r\n“Bright’s disease.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 175.--VERDIN’S SPHYGMOMETROGRAPH, FOR RECORDING THE\r\nACTION OF THE PULSE.]\r\n\r\n_Schools of Medicine._--While the regular school of medicine (called by\r\nsome “Allopathy”) has held the leading place in medicine, various other\r\nschools have sprung up in the Nineteenth Century, all of which represent\r\nadvances in a knowledge of the laws of health, and the modes of\r\npreventing and curing diseases. Hahnemann, in his “_Organon der\r\nRationellen Heilkunde_,” in 1810, gave homœopathy its name, and reduced\r\nit to a system. The doctrine of _similia similibus curantur_ (like cures\r\nlike), has gained great popularity in the latter part of the century.\r\nHydropathy, as a school, also made its appearance in the early part of\r\nthe Nineteenth Century. Priessnitz was its first disciple, and the\r\n_Grafenberg cure_, established in 1826, was a noted institution for many\r\nyears. The useful application of water in the form of baths and cold\r\npacks, has been known for centuries, and will always be used as a\r\nvaluable agency in sickness and in health. The “Thompsonian” system of\r\ntreating diseases was covered by patents in 1813, 1823 and 1836, and\r\nattained considerable notoriety in the early half of the century.\r\nSweating by hot bricks and hot tea made of “Composition Powders,”\r\nvomiting with lobelia to produce relaxation, and a fiery liquid for\r\ncramps, called “No. 6,” were the chief remedies, and very few boys who\r\nhad once taken the treatment were ever willing afterwards to admit that\r\nthey were sick. In the latter part of the Nineteenth Century\r\n_electro-therapeutics_ has received a large share of attention, many\r\nforms of medical batteries have been devised, and probably no more\r\npromising field of study and research exists in the whole domain of\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\n_Dentistry._--George Washington had false teeth, and it is said that the\r\nteeth of some of the mummies of Egypt had gold fillings, but it\r\nremained for the Nineteenth Century to establish dentistry as an art,\r\nand its influence in securing better mastication and digestion of food,\r\nmore sanitary mouths and shapely faces, cannot be estimated. Few people\r\ncan be found to-day who have not either filled teeth, bridge work, gold\r\ncaps, or artificial sets of teeth. The most important advance in the art\r\nwas in the invention of the rubber plate for holding the porcelain\r\nteeth. This was the invention of J. A. Cummings, and was covered by him\r\nin his patent No. 43,009, June 7, 1864. In more recent years\r\n“bridge-work” represents the most important advance. In this practice\r\none or more artificial teeth are firmly held in the place of missing\r\nteeth by a strong bridge-piece of metal, which at its ends is anchored\r\nto the adjacent natural teeth. This was first done by Bing (British Pat.\r\nNo. 167, of 1871), and was afterwards patented in somewhat different\r\nform in the United States by J. E. Lowe, No. 238,940, March 15, 1881,\r\nNo. 313,434, March 3, 1885, and Richmond, May 22, 1883, No. 277,933.\r\nPorcelain and gold crowns and dental pluggers run by electricity\r\nrepresent other important advances in this art. It is said that there\r\nare 20,425 dentists in the United States, and that in 1899 they employed\r\nin their practice 20,499,000 false teeth.\r\n\r\n_Artificial Limbs._--With the successful work of the surgeon came the\r\neffort to repair, as far as possible, the loss of the limb. Until about\r\nthe middle of the Nineteenth Century the survivor of an operation was an\r\nunsymmetrical, unique, and pitiful object. The peg-leg of Peter\r\nStuyvesant lives in history, and the arm-hook of Capt. Cuttle is\r\nfamiliar to every reader. The first United States patent for an\r\nartificial leg was granted to B. F. Palmer, Nov. 4, 1846, No. 4,834.\r\nWooden legs with a restricted back and forward ankle motion and a\r\nspring, were constructed by A. A. Marks from 1853 to 1863. On Dec. 1,\r\n1863, a patent, No. 40,763, was granted to Mr. Marks for the use of\r\nsponge rubber for constructing artificial feet and hands that dispensed\r\nwith the articulated joints, and made a great improvement. In patent No.\r\n366,494, July 12, 1887, to G. E. Marks, the foot and leg portion of a\r\nwooden leg are made from wood which grows with a crook, as at the root\r\nof a tree, where the strength and lightness of a continuous natural\r\ngrain is obtained at the instep. About 300 patents have been granted for\r\nartificial legs and arms. Modern improvements have extended to every\r\ndetail of construction, and so perfect to-day is the average wooden leg\r\nthat it is hardly to be detected. Men with wooden legs ride horseback,\r\nare expert users of the bicycle, and have even performed feats on the\r\ntight rope. The inventor’s genius has not stopped at repairing limbs,\r\nhowever, for artificial eyes, artificial ear drums, the audiphone, foot\r\nextensions for short legs, crutches, braces, abdominal supporters, and\r\nvarious other applications to supplement the defects of the body have\r\nbeen devised.\r\n\r\n_Digestion._--The physiology of digestion had, perhaps, the first real\r\nlight shed upon it by Beaumont’s observations from 1825 to 1832. A\r\nCanadian boatman, Alexis San Martin, was wounded in the abdomen from a\r\ncharge of buckshot, and the wound healed, leaving a permanent opening in\r\nthe stomach, through which the operation of digestion could be observed.\r\nThis furnished visible evidence of the relative digestibility of\r\ndifferent kinds of foods, and the general functions of the stomach. The\r\npeculiar and different conditions governing the digestion of the starch\r\nfoods, the albumenoids (such as meat and fish), and the sugars and fats,\r\nhave been clearly ascertained, and “what is one man’s food is another\r\nman’s poison” is now susceptible of intelligent diagnosis and effective\r\nadjustment. Of late years the stomach has been greatly aided in its\r\nfunctions by prepared or predigested foods. The action of diastase, in\r\nconverting starch into grape sugar, has been taken advantage of, and\r\ncereals treated with diatase, malted milk, lactated and peptonized\r\nfoods, have proven a boon to the enfeebled digestion, while the\r\nintelligent study of dietetics has done much to relieve the physician\r\nand promote the health of the individual by right living.\r\n\r\n_Bacteriology._--Although Leeuwenhoeck discovered the bacterium in\r\n1668-1675, up to 100 years ago disease and death were largely regarded\r\nas dispensations of Providence, and with fatuous resignation were\r\naccepted as inevitable. The microscope and the study of bacteriology,\r\nhowever, have revealed to us the presence of minute living organisms or\r\ngerms, which are everywhere around us, infesting the air, the earth, the\r\nwater, our food, our bodies, and all organic matter in countless\r\nmillions. These infinitely small beings multiply with a rapidity and\r\nfecundity that bewilders the imagination. Their method of multiplication\r\nis by fissiparism--that is to say, each splits into two independent\r\nbeings that separate and afterwards lead independent lives. It is said\r\nthat there is one species in which not more than six or seven minutes\r\nare required for the division to take place. A single individual might\r\nconsequently produce more than a thousand offspring in an hour, more\r\nthan a million in two hours, and in three hours more than the number of\r\ninhabitants on the globe. They are known as micro-organisms, of which\r\nthe bacteria are the most important. The bacteria are further divided\r\ninto species, and names are given them to distinguish the different\r\nforms. The little rod-shaped ones are called _bacilli_: the spheroidal\r\nones _micrococci_ or _cocci_. If they cling together in chains they are\r\ncalled _streptococci_; if of a spiral or corkscrew form they are called\r\n_spirallae_. The curved bacilli are called “_comma_” _bacilli_, from\r\ntheir resemblance to the punctuation mark of that name. The presence of\r\npeculiar forms of these bacteria in diseases has so suggested the\r\nrelation of cause and effect as to have given rise to the so-called\r\n“germ theory” of disease. Now we know with reasonable certainty that\r\ncholera, diphtheria, typhoid fever, whooping cough, mumps,\r\ncerebro-spinal meningitis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, hydrophobia, and\r\nmany other diseases have each its specific cause in the form of a\r\nmicrobe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 176.\r\n\r\nBACILLUS OF TUBERCULOSIS IN SPUTUM. BACILLUS OF DIPHTHERIA\r\n(KLEBS-LOEFFLER).\r\n\r\nBACILLUS OF TYPHOID FEVER.\r\n\r\n(Photo-Micrographs, 1,000 diam., by William M. Gray, M. D.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TERTIAN FORM. AESTIVO-AUTUMNAL FORM.\r\n\r\nFIG. 177.--BLOOD OF MAN. SHOWING PARASITE OF MALARIA (LAVERAN).\r\n\r\n(Photo-Micrographs, 1,000 diam., by William M. Gray, M. D.)]\r\n\r\nHenle, a German physiologist, as early as 1840, maintained the doctrine\r\nof _contagium vivum_, or contagion by the transmission of living germs.\r\nCertain classes of diseases have also long been known as zymotic, or\r\nferment diseases. Louis Pasteur’s work, however, marks the first\r\ndefinite and important results in the study of bacteriology, and he is\r\nthe father of the “germ theory” of disease. He exploded the previously\r\nheld theories of scientists concerning the spontaneous generation of\r\nliving things, and clearly established and promulgated the knowledge of\r\ndisease germs. Commencing his great work about 1865 with the\r\ninvestigation of the silk worm plague in France, he discovered it to be\r\ndue to parasites, and checked it. He also gave great attention to the\r\nsubject of fermentation, proving it to be caused by micro-organisms.\r\nTaking up the diseases of men and animals, he gave practical value to\r\nthe truths of his theory in the treatment of hydrophobia, diphtheria,\r\nand other diseases, using the principle of vaccination to destroy or\r\nrender innocuous the toxins or disease-producing poisons derived from\r\nliving germs. Working along the same lines must be mentioned Dr. Koch,\r\nwhose success in detecting the microbes which cause consumption and\r\ncholera has made him famous the world over. Of the great variety of\r\nthese little microbes which have been separately identified, many are\r\ninnocuous, and, in fact, subserve many important and useful purposes in\r\nnature, while others are to be as much dreaded as the deadly cobra or\r\nthe rattlesnake. A few typical examples of the latter are given in Figs.\r\n176 and 177, multiplied 1,000 diameters. The illustrations represented\r\nin Fig. 177 show the parasites that cause malaria, or fever and ague.\r\nThe dark bean-shaped cells are the normal blood corpuscles, and the few\r\nspeckled cells are those infested with the malarial parasites. It is now\r\nbelieved that the mosquito is the active factor in the dissemination of\r\nmalaria, and it is, therefore, to be remembered that this pestiferous\r\nlittle insect not only inflicts a painful and disagreeable sensation\r\nwith his puncture, but innoculates the system with poisonous malarial\r\ngerms at the same time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 178.\r\n\r\nTUBE CONTAINING CULTURE OF BACILLI OF TUBERCULOSIS.\r\n\r\nTUBE CONTAINING CULTURE OF COMMA BACILLI OF CHOLERA.]\r\n\r\nFor the study of bacteria they are propagated artificially in a test\r\ntube--_i. e._, a substance called a “culture” is prepared from some\r\norganic material which, like the substances of the human body, is\r\nfavorable to their propagation. Such culture media are found in beef\r\nblood, gelatine, beef extracts, meat broth, milk, etc. An ordinary\r\ntest-tube is supplied with some of the culture medium, and is then\r\nsterilized over the fire to destroy all interfering germs. Material\r\ninfected with the microbe is then placed in the test-tube by a\r\nsterilized platinum wire and the tube closed by raw cotton. It is then\r\nplaced in an incubator oven and is subjected to a gentle heat. In a\r\nlittle while the microbes begin to develop and increase, forming\r\ncolonies, in which they swarm by the million, and present the clotted\r\nappearance seen in Fig. 178. The separation of different bacteria\r\nexisting in the same material, so as to isolate each species and get\r\nwhat is called a “pure culture,” has been greatly promoted by Prof.\r\nKoch’s method of _plate culture_. In this the propagation of bacteria is\r\neffected upon a sterilized glass plate under a bell jar in such a thin\r\nlayer as to facilitate the segregation of species, enabling them to be\r\ncounted under the microscope and picked out and sown in another culture\r\nto get an unmixed crop of a definite species. Such a culture so\r\nmultiplies the same microbe, to the exclusion of others, as to permit it\r\nto be easily identified and studied.\r\n\r\nAccording to the practice in modern municipal health regulations, the\r\ntest as to when a child recovering from diphtheria is incapable of\r\ndisseminating the disease is by test culture. A swab of cotton is rubbed\r\nagainst the interior walls of the child’s throat to secure the germs (if\r\npresent), and the swab is then placed in a “culture” in a test-tube and\r\nthe tube put in an incubator. If, after the period of incubation, no\r\ncolonies of the germs develop, it is accepted as evidence that the\r\ndiphtheria germs are no longer present in the throat, and the child is\r\nreleased from quarantine.\r\n\r\nIt is the presence of these specific microbes in the fluids or solids of\r\nthe system which constitutes the disease, and for the cure of the same\r\nthe intelligent physician of to-day looks less to medication, and more\r\nfor some agent that will destroy the germ, neutralize its effect, or\r\nrender the body tolerant thereto. Out of the knowledge of disease germs\r\nhas grown the great era of antiseptic surgery, inaugurated by Sir Joseph\r\nLister, about 1865. Carbolic acid, the bichloride of mercury, and\r\nformalin are the most efficient weapons against the dreaded microbe.\r\nTo-day every surgeon in the civilized world sterilizes his knife, and\r\nconducts the treatment of wounds and all operations by antiseptic\r\nmethods, in accordance with a knowledge of the deadly influence of the\r\nubiquitous microbe, and the result has been to so reduce the risk to\r\nlife that even capital operations are no longer coupled with the\r\napprehensions of death. Every hospital, board of health, and organized\r\nmedical and sanitary body predicates its laws and modes of treatment\r\nupon the principles of bacteriology.\r\n\r\n_House Sanitation._--The permanent home of the microbe is the sewer, and\r\nsanitary plumbing, designed to exclude from the house the germ-laden and\r\ndisease-breeding gases from the sewer, constitutes one of the great\r\nadvances of the century. About 3,500 patents have been granted for water\r\nclosets and bath appliances, and about 900 patents on sewerage alone,\r\nthe most of which are directed to improved conditions of sanitation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 179A.--STREET CONNECTIONS, MODERN SANITARY HOUSE\r\nPLUMBING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 179.--MODERN SANITARY HOUSE PLUMBING.]\r\n\r\nAn illustration of the plumbing and sewer connections of a modern house\r\nis given in Figs. 179 and 179A. The sewer pipes are shown in solid\r\nblack, the unshaded pipes (in outline only) are air ventilation pipes,\r\nthe single black lines are cold water pipes, and the dotted lines hot\r\nwater pipes. The important sanitary feature in modern plumbing is to\r\nkeep all sewer gas and disease germs out of the house. For this purpose\r\ntraps have long been used under the wash basins, closet hoppers, and\r\nsinks; but the back pressure of sewer gas would sometimes bubble through\r\nthe trap into the house, and besides the water in passing out from a\r\nbasin would sometimes, by a siphon effect, pass entirely out of the\r\ntrap, leaving it unsealed. Both these results are prevented by the air\r\nventilation pipes which connect with the discharge side of every trap in\r\nthe house and lead to a stack extending out through the roof. This\r\nprevents pressure of sewer gas on the water seal of the trap, destroys\r\nthe siphon action of the trap and allows a circulation of air to be\r\ntaken in from the sidewalk on the house side of the running trap and\r\nthrough the sewer pipe of the house, and thence through the air vent\r\npipes to the roof.\r\n\r\nThe great science of bacteriology, dealing with these smallest of living\r\nthings, only came into existence with the microscope, and it was a field\r\nwhich was not only wholly unknown and unexplored a few years ago, but\r\nthere was no suggestion visible to the eye to direct attention to it,\r\nuntil the lens began to reveal the secrets of microcosm. What\r\ndevelopment the future may bring no one can predict, but to the\r\nbiologist and the physician no more promising field exists. Certain it\r\nis that the knowledge already gained is of incalculable benefit, and\r\nconstitutes one of the greatest eras of progress the world has known,\r\nfor with the noble army of patient, devoted, and self-sacrificing\r\nphysicians, the discoveries of the scientist, our boards of health, our\r\nhospitals and asylums for the insane, our quarantine laws, our modern\r\nplumbing and improved sanitation in the home and public departments,\r\nthere is no reason why the life of man should not be extended far beyond\r\nthe three-score and ten years, and the 50 per cent. of population dying\r\nin childhood saved for useful lives and citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE BICYCLE AND AUTOMOBILE.\r\n\r\n    THE DRAISINE, 1816--MICHAUX’S BICYCLE, 1855--UNITED STATES PATENT TO\r\n    LALLEMENT AND CARROL, 1866--TRANSITION FROM “VERTICAL FORK” AND\r\n    “STAR” TO MODERN “SAFETY”--PNEUMATIC TIRE--AUTOMOBILE, THE PROTOTYPE\r\n    OF THE LOCOMOTIVE--TREVITHICK’S STEAM ROAD CARRIAGE, 1801--THE\r\n    LOCOMOBILE OF TO-DAY--GAS ENGINE AUTOMOBILES OF PINKUS, 1839;\r\n    SELDEN, 1879; DURYEA, WINTON AND OTHERS--ELECTRIC AUTOMOBILES A\r\n    DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES AS EARLY AS 1836--GROUNELLE’S\r\n    ELECTRIC AUTOMOBILE OF 1852--THE COLUMBIA, AND OTHER ELECTRIC\r\n    CARRIAGES--STATISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever superior to other animals man may be in point of intellect, it\r\nmust be admitted that he is vastly inferior in his natural equipment for\r\nlocomotion. Quadrupeds have twice as many legs, run faster, and stand\r\nmore firmly. Birds have their two legs supplemented with wings that give\r\na wonderfully increased speed in flight, and fish, with no legs at all,\r\nrun races with the fastest steamers; but man has awkwardly toddled on\r\ntwo stilted supports since prehistoric time, and for the first year of\r\nhis life is unable to walk at all. That he has felt his inferiority is\r\nclear, for his imagination has given wings to the angels, and has\r\ndepicted Mercury, the messenger of the gods, with a similar equipment on\r\nhis heels. We see the ambition for speed exemplified even in the baby,\r\nwho crows in exhilaration at rapid movement, and in the boy when the\r\nride on the flying horses, the glide on the ice, or the swift descent on\r\nthe toboggan slide, brings a flash to his eye and a glow to his cheeks.\r\n\r\nA characteristic trend of the present age is toward increased speed in\r\neverything, and the most conspicuous example of accelerated speed in\r\nlate years is the bicycle. It has, with its fascination of silent motion\r\nand the exhilaration of flight, driven the younger generation wild with\r\nenthusiasm, has limbered up the muscles of old age, has revolutionized\r\nthe attire of men and women, and well-nigh supplanted the old-fashioned\r\nuse of legs. It is the most unique and ubiquitous piece of organized\r\nmachinery ever made. The thoroughfares and highways of civilization\r\nfairly swarm with thousands of glistening and silently gliding wheels.\r\nIt is to be found everywhere, even to the steppes of Asia, the plains\r\nof Australia, and the ice fields of the Arctic.\r\n\r\nThe true definition of the bicycle is a two-wheeled vehicle, with one\r\nwheel in front and the other in the rear, and both in the same vertical\r\nplane. Its life principle is the physical law that a rotating body tends\r\nto preserve its plane of rotation, and so it stands up, when it moves,\r\non the same principle that a top does when it spins or a child’s hoop\r\nremains erect when it rolls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 180.--THE DRAISINE, 1816.]\r\n\r\nA form of carriage adapted to be propelled by the muscular effort of the\r\nrider was constructed and exhibited in Paris by Blanchard and Magurier,\r\nand was described in the _Journal de Paris_ as early as July 27, 1779,\r\nbut the true bicycle was the product of the Nineteenth Century. It was\r\ninvented by Baron von Drais, of Manheim-on-the Rhine. See Fig. 180. It\r\nconsisted of two wheels, one before the other, in the same plane, and\r\nconnected together by a bar bearing a saddle, the front wheel being\r\narranged to turn about a vertical axis and provided with a handle for\r\nguiding. The rider supported his elbows on an arm rest and propelled the\r\ndevice by striking his toes upon the ground, and in this way thrusted\r\nhimself along, while guiding his course by the handle bar and swivelling\r\nfront wheel. This machine was called the “Draisine.” It was patented in\r\nFrance for the Baron by Louis Joseph Dineur, and was exhibited in Paris\r\nin 1816. In 1818 Denis Johnson secured an English patent for an improved\r\nform of this device, but the principle of propulsion remained the same.\r\nThis device, variously known as the “Draisine,” “vélocipède,”\r\n“célérifère,” “pedestrian curricle,” “dandy horse,” and “hobby-horse,”\r\nwas introduced in New York in 1819, and was greeted for a time with\r\ngreat enthusiasm in that and other cities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 181.--VELOCIPEDE OF 1868.]\r\n\r\nOn June 26, 1819, William K. Clarkson was granted a United States patent\r\nfor a vélocipède, but the records were destroyed in the fire of 1836. In\r\n1821 Louis Gompertz devised an improved form of “hobby-horse,” in which\r\na vibrating handle, with segmental rack engaging with a pinion on the\r\nfront wheel axle, enabled the hands to be employed as well as the feet\r\nin propelling the machine. Such devices all relied, however, upon the\r\nstriking of the ground with the toes. Their fame was evanescent,\r\nhowever, and for forty years thereafter little or no attention was paid\r\nto this means of locomotion, except in the construction of children’s\r\ncarriages and velocipedes having three or more wheels.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 Ernst Michaux, a French locksmith, applied, for the first time,\r\nthe foot cranks and pedals to the axle of the drive wheel. A United\r\nStates patent, No. 59,915, taken Nov. 20, 1866, in the joint names of\r\nLallement and Carrol, represented, however, the revival of development\r\nin this field. Lallement was a Frenchman, and built a machine having the\r\npedals on the axle of the drive wheel, and it was at one time believed\r\nthat it was he who deserved the credit for this feature, but it is\r\nclaimed for Michaux, and the monument erected by the French in 1894 to\r\nErnest and Pierre Michaux at Bar le Duc gives strength to the claim. The\r\nbicycle, as represented at this stage of development, is shown in Fig.\r\n181. In 1868-’69 machines of this type went extensively into use.\r\nBicycle schools and riding academies appeared all through the East, and\r\nnotwithstanding the excessive muscular effort required to propel the\r\nheavy and clumsy wooden wheels, the old “bone-shaker” was received with\r\na furor of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 182.--VERTICAL FORK OF 1879.]\r\n\r\nIn 1869 Magee, in Paris, made the entire bicycle of iron and steel,\r\nsolid rubber tires and brakes followed, and the front wheel began to\r\ngrow to larger size, until in 1879 the bicycle presented the form shown\r\nin Fig. 182. This placed the weight of the rider more directly over the\r\ndrive wheel, and was known as the “vertical fork.” It gave good results\r\nbut for the accidents from “headers,” to which it was especially\r\nliable. Means to overcome the danger were resorted to, and the “Star”\r\nbicycle represented such a construction. In this the high wheel was\r\nbehind and the small one in front, and straps and ratchet wheels\r\nconnected the pedals to the axle. In 1877 Rousseau, of Marseilles,\r\nremoved the pedals from the wheel axle and applied the power to the axle\r\nby a chain extending from a sprocket wheel on the pedal shaft to a\r\nsprocket wheel on the wheel axle. By gradual steps, initiated in\r\nStarley’s “Rover” in 1880, (see Fig. 183), the high front wheel was\r\nreduced in size, until the proportions of the modern “Safety” (Fig. 184)\r\nhave been obtained. Strange to say, these proportions have, through\r\nnearly a century of evolution, gone back to those employed in the old\r\n“Draisine,” where the two wheels were of the same size. The modern\r\n“Safety,” however, is quite a different machine. Its diamond frame of\r\nlight but strong tubular steel, its ball bearings, its suspension wheels\r\nand pneumatic tires impart to the modern bicycle strength with\r\nlightness, and beauty with efficiency, to a degree scarcely attained by\r\nany other piece of organized machinery designed for such trying work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 183.--“ROVER,” 1880.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 184.--MODERN “SAFETY.”]\r\n\r\nThe most important of all modern improvements on the bicycle was perhaps\r\nthe pneumatic tire. This was not originally designed for the bicycle,\r\nbut was patented in England by R. W. Thompson in 1845 and in the United\r\nStates May 8, 1847, No. 5,104. Its application to the bicycle was made\r\nin 1889 by Dunlop, United States patent No. 435,995, Sept. 9, 1890, and\r\n453,550, June 2, 1891. It furnishes not only an elastic bearing which\r\ncushions the jar, but also makes a broader tread that renders cycling on\r\nthe soft roads of the country at once practical and delightful. The\r\nchainless wheel, which connects the axle of the pedal crank with the\r\naxle of the rear wheel by a shaft with bevel gears, is the most recent\r\nform exploited by the manufacturers, but it is doubtful whether it\r\npresents any points of superiority over the chain type. All of the parts\r\nof the bicycle have come in for a share of attention at the hands of\r\ninventors, differential speed gears and brakes having received especial\r\nattention. The Morrow hub brake, which applies friction to the rear\r\nwheel hub by back pressure on the pedal, is a popular modern form. The\r\nfirst back-pedal brake is shown in United States Pat. No. 418,142, to\r\nStover & Hance, Dec. 24, 1889.\r\n\r\nAmong the many modifications of the bicycle as used to-day may be\r\nmentioned the drop frame, which has made cycling possible for ladies,\r\nthe tandem, for two riders, the sextet or octet, carrying six or eight\r\nriders and resembling a centipede in movement and an express train in\r\nspeed: the ice velocipede, in which two runners are combined with a\r\nspiked driving wheel, and the hydrocycle, or water velocipede, in which\r\nthe drive wheel, formed with paddles, is used to propel a buoyant hull\r\nthrough the water.\r\n\r\nIn point of speed there seems to be no limit to the bicycle. In a test\r\nmade on the Long Island Railroad in the summer of 1899 between a wheel\r\nand an express train, the bicyclist, riding on a plank road between the\r\nrails and protected behind the train by a wind break, covered a mile in\r\n57⅘ seconds, and while going at top speed of more than a mile a minute,\r\novertook the train, was caught by his friends on a rear platform and\r\npulled on board, bicycle and all. This is the first instance on record\r\nof overtaking and boarding an express train going at the rate of\r\nsixty-four miles an hour, and yet it is said that the rider (Murphy) was\r\nnot doing his best.\r\n\r\nNearly 5,000 patents have been granted on velocipedes and bicycles. Most\r\nof them were for bicycles which, as improved to-day, are not only as\r\nfleet as the birds, but almost as countless in numbers. It is estimated\r\nthat in 1889 the total product of bicycles in this country reached\r\n200,000 machines annually. In 1892, after the general adoption of the\r\npneumatic tire, a great increase followed, which has grown from year to\r\nyear until in the year 1899 a conservative estimate for the output in\r\nthe United States is 1,000,000 wheels annually, worth from thirty to\r\nfifty million dollars. Each bicycle tire takes about two pounds of pure\r\nrubber, or four pounds to the wheel. The annual output in wheels\r\nconsequently consumes about 4,000,000 pounds, or 2,000 tons of rubber.\r\nTen years ago there were not more than twenty-five legitimate\r\nmanufacturers of bicycles in the United States. In 1897 there were over\r\n200 concerns in the business. It is estimated that there are to-day\r\nbetween 150 and 155 regular manufacturers, exclusive of the mere\r\nassemblers of parts. The Pope Manufacturing Company, which occupies the\r\nleading place, employed in 1888 about 500 hands. To-day their shops give\r\nemployment to 3,800 workmen, which furnishes a significant object lesson\r\nas to the importance and growth of the industry.\r\n\r\n_The Automobile._--Gliding silently along our city streets without the\r\ncustomary accompaniment of the clatter of the horse’s hoofs, the\r\nautomobile suggests to the average observer a very recent invention.\r\nThis is, however, not the case. The automobile is older even than the\r\nlocomotive, and is, in fact, the early model from which the rail\r\nlocomotive was evolved. As early as 1680 Sir Isaac Newton proposed a\r\nsteam carriage in which the propelling power was the reactionary\r\ndischarge of a rearwardly directed jet of steam. Cugnot, in 1769, built\r\na steam carriage, which is still preserved in the museum of the\r\nConservatoire des Arts et Métiers in Paris. Hornblower also in the same\r\nyear devised a steam carriage. Watt’s patents of 1769 and 1784\r\ncontemplated the application of his steam engines to carriages running\r\non land. Symington in 1770, and Murdoch in 1784, built experimental\r\nmodels. In 1787 Oliver Evans obtained a patent in Maryland for the\r\nexclusive right to make steam road wagons. Nathan Read in 1790 also\r\npatented and built a steam carriage.\r\n\r\nOf these, Cugnot represents the pioneer in the heavier forms of\r\nself-propelled vehicles, but the steam carriage which best deserves to\r\nbe regarded as the prototype of the modern passenger automobile is that\r\nof Trevithick, in England, who may also be considered as the father of\r\nthe locomotive. On Christmas eve, 1801, this steam carriage made its\r\nexperimental trip along the high road carrying seven or eight\r\npassengers. The next day the party, with Trevithick in charge of the\r\nengine, visited Tehidy House, the home of Lord Dunstanville. They met\r\nwith an accident, however, and the carriage turned over. It was placed\r\nunder shelter, and while the party were at the hotel regaling themselves\r\nwith roast goose and popular drinks, the water in the engine boiled\r\naway, the iron became red hot, and nothing combustible was left either\r\nof the carriage or the building in which it was sheltered. On March 24,\r\n1802, Trevithick and Vivian obtained a British patent, No. 2,599, on\r\nthis device, and another carriage was built, and in the spring of 1803\r\nstarted a run from Camborne to Redruth, but it stuck in the mud. It was\r\npopularly known as Capt. Trevithick’s “Puffing Devil.” It was\r\nsubsequently reconstructed in London and run upon the streets of that\r\ncity. Fig. 185 presents an illustration of the first steam automobile.\r\nThe cylinders and pistons were enclosed within the fire box in the rear.\r\nClutches (called striking boxes) on the axle of the front gear wheel\r\nallowed either running wheel to move independently of the other in\r\nturning. A pair of small front steering wheels was arranged to turn\r\nabout a vertical axis and was manipulated by a handle bar. A brake was\r\nprovided for in the specification, as were also variable gears for\r\nchanging speed, and an automatic blower for the fire. The carriage had\r\nan elevated coach body mounted on springs, and the running wheels were\r\nof large size, adapted to the higher speed and lighter uses of passenger\r\ntraffic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 185.--TREVITHICK’S STEAM CARRIAGE, 1801.]\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to trace the succeeding steps in steam carriage\r\ndevelopment by James and Anderson, by Gurney, in 1822, by Marcerone and\r\nSquire in 1833, by Russel in 1846, and many others; it is sufficient to\r\nknow that bad roads and the success attending the steam locomotive on\r\nrails diverted attention from the steam road carriage, and not until the\r\nlatter part of the Nineteenth Century was there any marked revival of\r\ninterest in this field. Then came first the ponderous road engine, known\r\nas a traction engine, and used for heavy hauling; and this in the last\r\ndecade has been followed by the modern steam motor carriage, an example\r\nof which is seen in Figs. 186 and 186A, which represent the “Locomobile”\r\nand its actuating mechanism. The fuel used is gasoline, stored in a\r\nthree-gallon tank under the footboard. The boiler, which is arranged\r\nunder the seat, is a vertical cylinder wrapped with piano wire for\r\ngreater tensile strength, and contains 298 copper tubes. The engine,\r\nwhich is seen in Fig. 186A, is arranged in upright position under the\r\nseat, in front of the boiler, has two cylinders, 2½-inch diameter and\r\n4-inch stroke, a Stephenson link-motion and an ordinary D-valve.\r\nSprocket wheels and a chain connect the engine shaft to the rear axle.\r\nThe engine runs from 300 to 400 revolutions per minute and develops\r\nfrom four to five horse power. It has a muffle for the steam exhaust\r\nand the whole weight is 550 pounds. It is one of the lightest and\r\ncheapest of automobiles, runs easily at ten to twelve miles an hour, and\r\nis an efficient hill-climber. Although naming the steam automobile first\r\nbecause of its earlier genesis, it is not to be understood as\r\nrepresenting at present the most popular type of motor carriage,\r\nalthough it bids fair to become so.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 186.--“LOCOMOBILE” STEAM CARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 186A.--THE FOUR HORSE POWER ENGINES OF\r\n“LOCOMOBILE.”]\r\n\r\nIn France and the continent of Europe the type employing an explosive\r\nmixture of gasoline and air is most frequently found, and in England and\r\nthe United States the electric motor with the storage battery is chiefly\r\nused.\r\n\r\nIn automobiles of the explosive gas type probably the earliest example\r\nis found in the British patent to Pinkus, No. 8,207, of 1839. In France\r\nLenoir, in 1860, is credited with being the pioneer. Among modern\r\napplications the patent to George B. Selden, No. 549,160, occupies a\r\nprominent place. This was only granted Nov. 5, 1895, but the application\r\nfor the patent was filed in the Patent Office May 8, 1879 so that the\r\ninvention described has quite an early date, and some broad claims have\r\nbeen allowed to the inventor. In the last decade many applications of\r\nthe explosive gas engine to road carriages and tricycles have been made,\r\nespecially in France. Representative motor carriages of this type are to\r\nbe found in the United States in the Duryea and the Winton. An\r\nillustration of the latter is given in Fig. 187. The form shown\r\nrepresents a phaeton weighing 1,400 pounds; the motor is of the single\r\nhydrocarbon type, and is simple, powerful and compact. It is also free\r\nfrom noise and vibration, and is under control at all times. The maximum\r\nspeed is eighteen miles an hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 187.--WINTON AUTOMOBILE. HYDROCARBON TYPE.]\r\n\r\nProbably the most popular type of the automobile in the United States is\r\nthe “electric.” The application of the electric motor to the propulsion\r\nof vehicles dates back to quite an early period. It is said that as far\r\nback as 1835 Stratingh and Becker, of Groeningen, and in 1836 Botto, of\r\nTurin, constructed crude electric carriages. Davenport, in 1835,\r\nDavidson, in 1838, and Dr. Page, in 1851, built electric locomotives\r\nwhich ran on rails. The prototype of the electric automobile, however,\r\nis best represented in the French patent to M. Grounelle, No. 7,728,\r\nFeb. 7, 1852 (2 Ser., Vol. 25, p. 220, pl. 46.) This shows a perfectly\r\nequipped electric automobile. It did not have a practical electric\r\ngenerator, however, for the storage battery was not then known. A large\r\nsulphate of copper battery was employed, which could through the agency\r\nof a train of gears give only a very slow speed. This road carriage,\r\nhowever, only needed a storage battery to make it a well organized and\r\nefficient electric automobile. It is believed by many that electricity\r\nfulfills more of the necessary conditions of a successful motive power\r\nfor motor carriages than any other power. It is clean, compact,\r\nnoiseless, free from vibration, heat, dirt and gases, and is under\r\nperfect control. Its chief objection is that it is only possible to\r\nrecharge it where electric power is available, and in this respect it is\r\ninferior to the gasoline motor, whose supply may be conveniently\r\nobtained at every city, village, and country store. The Columbia\r\ntwo-seated Dos-a-Dos (Fig. 188), Woods’ Victoria Hansom Cab, and the\r\nRiker Electric Delivery Wagon are representative types of the modern\r\nelectric automobile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 188.--THE COLUMBIA “DOS-A-DOS.”]\r\n\r\nAll of the motor carriages illustrated are of American make, and for\r\nlightness, grace, and efficiency they have no superiors. A peculiar and\r\nrecent type which attracted much attention and took the gold medal at\r\nthe Motor Carriage Exposition at Berlin, held in September, 1899, is the\r\nPieper double motor carriage. It has both a benzine motor and an\r\nelectric motor, which can be worked separately or together, and yet is\r\nsaid to be lighter than most electric carriages. On a long journey,\r\nremote from electrical supply, the benzine motor is used not only to\r\npropel the carriage, but by running the electric motor as a dynamo or\r\ngenerator, recharges the storage battery. On level, easy roads, where\r\nthe power required falls below the maximum power exerted by the benzine\r\nmotor, the electric motor changes automatically to a dynamo and the\r\nsurplus force of the benzine motor is converted into current and stored.\r\nIn running down hill or stopping the carriage, the momentum of the\r\nvehicle is also received by the electric motor acting as a dynamo and\r\nbrake, and is stored as electricity in the battery, which is thus in an\r\nordinary journey kept constantly charged.\r\n\r\nIt is not probable that man will ever be able to get along without the\r\nhorse, but the release of the noble animal from the bondage of city\r\ntraffic, which was begun only a few years ago with mechanical street car\r\npropulsion, promises now to be extensively advanced by the substitution\r\nof the motor carriage and the auto-truck for team-drawn vehicles. The\r\nrapidity with which this industry has grown, and its promise for the\r\nfuture may be realized when it is remembered that so far as practical\r\nresults are concerned it has all grown up in the last decade of the\r\nNineteenth Century, and yet to-day it is said that there are already in\r\nthe United States about 200 incorporated concerns with an aggregate\r\ncapitalization of some $500,000,000, organized to build automobiles, to\r\nsay nothing of the vast number of individuals who are experimenting in\r\nthis field. The greatest activity, however, is to be found in France,\r\nwhich claims over 600 manufacturers and has in use 6,000 automobiles out\r\nof a total of 11,000 in all of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe most significant suggestion for the future of the automobile is that\r\nthe cost of maintenance and all things considered, it is in some\r\napplications cheaper than the horse-drawn vehicles of the same\r\nefficiency. In a consular report of Oct. 16, 1899, forwarded to the\r\nState Department by Mr. Marshal Halsted, consul at Birmingham, Mr. E. H.\r\nBayley, an English authority, is quoted as saying that in operating\r\nheavy motor vehicles for hauling, the cost is three half-pence (three\r\ncents) per net ton per mile, as compared with 18 to 24 cents per net ton\r\nper mile by horse-drawn vehicles. In England much attention is being\r\ngiven to this subject.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, the modern automobile cannot be considered as a new\r\ninvention so far as fundamental principles are concerned. Its success,\r\nin late years, is to be credited to the perfection of the arts in\r\ngeneral, and as essential factors contributing to this may be named the\r\nrefinement of steel, giving increased strength with lightness, the\r\nincreased efficiency of motive power, the vulcanization of rubber, the\r\nmathematical nicety of mechanical adjustment, the reduction of friction\r\nby ball bearings, the wonderful developments in electricity and\r\nimprovement in roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE PHONOGRAPH.\r\n\r\n    INVENTION OF PHONOGRAPH BY EDISON--SCOTT’S PHONAUTOGRAPH--\r\n    IMPROVEMENTS OF BELL AND TAINTER--THE GRAPHOPHONE--LIBRARY OF WAX\r\n    CYLINDERS--THE GRAMOPHONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing closely upon the discovery of the telephone the phonograph\r\ncame, literally speaking for itself, and adding another surprise to the\r\nwonderful inventions of that prolific period. It was in the latter part\r\nof 1877 that Thomas A. Edison showed to a few privileged friends a\r\nmodest looking little machine. He turned the crank, and to the\r\nastonishment of those present it said. “Good morning! How do you do? How\r\ndo you like the phonograph?” Its voice was a little metallic, it is\r\ntrue, but here was presented an insignificant looking piece of mechanism\r\nwhich was undeniably a talking machine and one with an unlimited\r\nvocabulary. So-called talking machines had been made before, of which\r\nthe Faber machine was a type. These, by an arrangement of bellows to\r\nfurnish air, and flexible pipes in imitation of the larynx and vocal\r\norgans, made laborious and wheezy efforts to imitate the mechanical\r\nfunctions of the throat and tongue in articulate speech, but the method\r\nwas fundamentally faulty and no success was attained. Edison followed no\r\nsuch leading. His phonograph made no attempt at imitating in\r\nconstruction the complex organization of the human throat, but was as\r\nwonderful in its divergence therefrom and in its simplicity as it was in\r\nthe success of its results. The machine was patented by him Feb. 19,\r\n1878, No. 200,521, and its life principle is simply and clearly defined\r\nin the first claim of the patent, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The method herein specified of reproducing the human voice, or\r\n    other sounds, by causing the sound vibrations to be recorded\r\n    substantially as specified, and obtaining motion from that record as\r\n    set forth for the reproduction of sound vibrations.”\r\n\r\nThe invention was a striking and interesting novelty and at once\r\nattracted the attention of scientific men as well as the general public.\r\nIts first public exhibition was about the latter part of January, 1878,\r\nbefore the Polytechnic Association of the American Institute, at New\r\nYork. It spoke English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish and Hebrew with\r\nequal facility. It imitated the barking of a dog and crowing of a cock,\r\nand then catching cold, coughed and sneezed and wheezed until it is said\r\na physician in the audience proposed sending a prescription for it. It\r\nwas also suggested by an irreverent man that it might take the place of\r\npreachers in the rendition of sermons, while another thought that as it\r\nreproduced music with equal facility it might take the place of preacher\r\nand choir both. In the spring of 1878 it was exhibited at Washington by\r\nEdison and his assistant, Mr. Batchelor. Mr. Edison was the guest of Mr.\r\nU. H. Painter, and in his parlors it was shown to a party of gentlemen.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Painter’s house the machine was taken to the office of the\r\nAssistant Secretary of the Interior, thence to the Academy of Sciences,\r\nin session at the Smithsonian Institution, and at night it was taken to\r\nthe White House and exhibited to President and Mrs. Hayes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 189.--FIRST PHONOGRAPH.]\r\n\r\nThe form of the first phonograph is shown in Fig. 189. It consisted of\r\nthree principal parts--the mouthpiece A, into which speech was uttered,\r\nthe spirally grooved cylinder B, carrying on its periphery a sheet of\r\ntin foil, and a second mouthpiece D. The cylinder B and its axial shaft\r\nwere both provided with spiral grooves or screw threads of exactly the\r\nsame pitch, and when the shaft was turned by its crank its screw\r\nthreaded bearings caused the cylinder to slowly advance as it rotated.\r\nThe mouthpiece A had adjacent to the cylinder a flexible diaphragm\r\ncarrying a little point or stylus which bore against the tin foil on the\r\ncylinder. When the mouthpiece A was spoken into and the cylinder B was\r\nturned, the little stylus, vibrating from the voice impulses, traced by\r\nindentations a little jagged path in the tin foil that formed the\r\nrecord. To reproduce the record in speech again, the mouthpiece A was\r\nadjusted away from the cylinder, the cylinder run back to the starting\r\npoint, and mouthpiece D was then brought up to the cylinder. This\r\nmouthpiece had a diaphragm and stylus similar to the other one, only\r\nmore delicately constructed. This stylus was adjusted to bear lightly in\r\nthe little spiral path in the tin foil traced by the other stylus, and\r\nas the tin foil revolved with the cylinder its jagged irregularities set\r\nup the same vibrations in the diaphragm of mouthpiece D as those caused\r\nby the voice on the other diaphragm, and thus translated the record into\r\nsounds of articulate speech, exactly corresponding to the words first\r\nspoken into the instrument. In Fig. 190 is shown a further development\r\nof the phonograph, in which a single mouthpiece with diaphragm and\r\nstylus serves the purpose both of recorder for making the record and a\r\nspeaker for reproducing it, a trumpet or horn being used, as indicated\r\nin dotted lines, to concentrate the vibrations in recording and to\r\naugment the sound in reproducing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 190.--SECOND FORM OF PHONOGRAPH.]\r\n\r\nThe phonograph is in reality a development of the phonautograph, which\r\nwas an instrument invented by Leon Scott in 1857 to automatically record\r\nsounds by diagrams. There is a model of Scott’s phonautograph in the\r\nNational Museum at Washington, D. C, and it consists of a chamber to\r\ncatch the sound waves and an elastic diaphragm with stylus working on a\r\nrevolving cylinder bearing a sheet of paper coated with lampblack. The\r\nphonograph’s record-making mouthpiece, with its diaphragm and stylus, is\r\nsubstantially a phonautograph, but instead of simply causing the stylus\r\nto trace a record on carbon-coated paper and stopping with this result,\r\nEdison traced a record in a substance--tinfoil--which was capable of\r\nmechanically translating that record into sound again by a mere reversal\r\nof the function of the stylus and diaphragm. This was the very essence\r\nof simplicity and logical reasoning. All records had been heretofore\r\ntraced for visual inspection only. Edison’s record was not for visual\r\ninspection, but was endowed with the mechanical function of reproducing\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nFrom the first Edison believed that his phonograph was to fill an\r\nimportant place in the business activities of the world, since here\r\nseemed a silent but faithful stenographer which reproduced the words of\r\nthe speaker with absolute fidelity, even to the quality of emphasis and\r\ninflection, and which made no mistakes, was always even with the speaker\r\nin its work, and asked no questions. For a number of years, however, the\r\ninvention lay dormant and served no other purpose than that of a\r\nscientific curiosity or an amusing toy. The difficulty of its practical\r\napplication largely existed in the perishable form of the record, which,\r\nbeing in tinfoil, was liable to be mutilated and distorted, and was not\r\nwell adapted for storage or transportation.\r\n\r\nA few years after the announcement of Mr. Edison’s invention. Dr.\r\nAlexander Graham Bell, the distinguished inventor of the telephone, with\r\nhis associates, Messrs. Chichester A. Bell and Charles Sumner Tainter,\r\ndirected their attention to the improvement of the phonograph. Dr. Bell\r\nhad received from the French government, upon the recommendation of the\r\nFrench Academy of Sciences, the Volta prize of 50,000 francs as a\r\nrecognition of his successful work in acoustics and the invention of the\r\ntelephone, and with this sum he built the Volta Institute in Washington\r\nand carried on the work of developing the phonograph.\r\n\r\nOn May 4, 1886, Chichester A. Bell and Sumner Tainter obtained patents\r\nNos. 341,214 and 341,288, which covered a great improvement in the\r\nrecord of the phonograph. This invention substituted for the tinfoil\r\nsheet a surface of wax, which was finally fashioned into a cylinder, and\r\ninstead of merely indenting the record on tinfoil the stylus cut a\r\ndistinct groove or kerf in the wax cylinder as it revolved, dislodging\r\ntherefrom a minute filament or shaving and forming a record which was\r\nnot only far more positive in its translating effect and more easily\r\ntransported and stored, but was also less perishable, and besides it\r\ncould be easily effaced without loss of the cylinder by simply smoothing\r\noff the surface of the cylinder again when it was desired to make a new\r\nrecord. This invention quickly grew into practical use, and is known as\r\nthe “Graphophone.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 191.--THE GRAPHOPHONE, RECORDING AND REPRODUCING\r\nDEVICES.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 191 is shown on the left a cross section of the diaphragm,\r\nrecording stylus, and wax cylinder, of the graphophone, the stylus\r\nplowing a tiny groove in the wax cylinder in the act of recording the\r\nspeech, and on the right is shown the reproducing stylus traversing the\r\nrecord groove in the wax cylinder, and the diaphragm chamber with which\r\nthe ear tubes are connected. The grooves in the wax, although giving\r\nforth mechanical movement that is translated into sound, are very\r\nminute, being only 6/10,000 of an inch deep.\r\n\r\nWhen the possibilities of the graphophone became known, capital was\r\nquickly supplied for its commercial exploitation, and the Columbia\r\nPhonograph Company was organized. At the present time, owing to the\r\ngreat increase in the business, the control of the graphophone business\r\nis vested in two branches, the Columbia Phonograph Company, which has\r\ncharge of the selling, and which has offices throughout all the\r\nprincipal cities of this country and some of the larger ones of Europe,\r\nand the American Graphophone Company, which attends to the manufacturing\r\nbranch, and whose factory is located at Bridgeport, Conn., where, it is\r\nsaid, that in 1898 the production of the factory reached the point of\r\none graphophone for every minute of the day, making a total daily output\r\nof 600 machines. Although the Bell and Tainter patents of 1886 represent\r\nthe basic principles of the graphophone, its development and perfection\r\nhave been contributed to in many subsequent improvements by Messrs.\r\nBell, Tainter, McDonald, and others. The more important of these are\r\ncovered by patents No. 375,579, Dec. 27, 1887; No. 380,535, April 3,\r\n1888; No. 527,755, Oct. 16, 1894, and No. 579,595, March 30, 1897.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this industry it was thought that the principal use\r\nof the instrument would be found in business applications, to take the\r\nplace of the stenographer, but it proved difficult to revolutionize\r\noffice methods, especially as the earlier machines were somewhat\r\nintricate, and the business man had no time to divide in engineering a\r\nmachine. These difficulties, however, have been so far overcome by\r\nmodern improvements and simplification of the machine that its use in\r\nbusiness houses as an amanuensis has become quite common. The greatest\r\nuse of the graphophone is, however, for amusement purposes. Its songs,\r\norchestral and solo renditions, and its humorous monologue reproductions\r\nconstitute to-day a great library of wax cylinders, regularly catalogued\r\nand sold by the thousands. It will readily be understood that the\r\nformation of the cylinders must constitute a great business of itself\r\nwhen it is remembered that many record cylinders accompany each\r\ngraphophone, and that the latter are turned out at the rate of one a\r\nminute by a single company. Many thousands of these cylinders are made\r\ndaily. Some are sent out simply as plain wax cylinders, onto which the\r\nrecords are made by the voice of the purchaser, while others have\r\nrecords made for them of popular music, monologues in dialect, humorous\r\nspeeches, etc. The waxy composition, which is in reality a species of\r\nsoap, is melted in huge pots, and then passes from one floor to\r\nanother, undergoing a refining process in its progress, and finally\r\nreaches the molds. These molds are arranged in rows around a horizontal\r\nwheel about eight feet in diameter. The wheel is kept revolving, and a\r\nman on one side is kept constantly busy in filling the molds with the\r\nmolten material as they reach him. A half revolution of the wheel brings\r\nthe filled molds to the other side of the room, and by that time the\r\nmaterial has hardened sufficiently to enable another attendant,\r\nstationed there, to remove the cylinders from the molds. Thus the wheel\r\nis kept going, receiving at one side a charge of the melted wax and\r\ndischarging at the other molded cylinders, which are afterwards turned\r\ntrue on the surface. The record-making department is both unique and\r\ninteresting. Here the records of music are produced, and they are made\r\nby bands and performers engaged for the purpose, many of which,\r\noperating at the same time, produce such a medley as to be scarcely\r\ndistinguishable to the visitor. The records are tested by about half a\r\nhundred women, each of whom has a little compartment or booth framed in\r\nby glass partitions. The duty of the tester is to decide upon the merits\r\nof the record by actually listening to it on the graphophone.\r\n\r\nA very important feature in record-making, from a commercial standpoint,\r\nis in means for cheaply duplicating records. If every record cylinder\r\nhad to be made by the separate act of a performer such records would be\r\nvery expensive. An original record is first made by some celebrated\r\nmusician or speaker, and this record is afterwards multiplied and\r\nreproduced in large numbers. For this purpose an original record by\r\nsuitable mechanism is made to take the place of the speaker or singer,\r\nand so multiplies and reproduces the original record. The duplicating of\r\nrecords was contemplated by Edison from the first, as seen in his\r\nBritish patent, 1,644 of 1878, and later appliances for accomplishing\r\nsuch results are covered under Tainter’s patent, No. 341,287, Bettini’s,\r\nNo. 488,381, and McDonald’s, No. 559,806. The diaphragms used in the\r\nrecorders and reproducers are made of French rolled plate glass, thinner\r\nthan a sheet of ordinary writing paper. The recording stylus is shaped\r\nlike a little gouge to cut the little grooves in the wax, while the\r\ncorresponding stylus of the reproducer has a ball-shaped end to travel\r\nin the groove. Both the recording stylus and reproducing ball are made\r\nof sapphire, chosen on account of its hardness, to resist the great\r\nfrictional wear to which they are subjected. When a record is to be\r\neffaced from a cylinder, it is turned off smooth on a sort of lathe, and\r\nthe cutting tool or knife for this purpose is also made of sapphire.\r\n\r\nThe latest, loudest, and most impressive form of the talking machine is\r\nthe “Graphophone Grand.” This has a horn attachment exceeding the big\r\nhorn of a brass band in size, and the wax cylinder is about four inches\r\nin diameter. Its reproductions in music and speech are so full and\r\nstrong as to be clearly heard at the most remote part of a large hall,\r\nand its versatile voice lends effective rendition to all sorts and kinds\r\nof sounds, from the inspiring chords of “A Choir Invisible” to the\r\ngrandiloquent and facetious rattle of a noisy and hustling auctioneer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 192.--MODERN PHONOGRAPH.]\r\n\r\nIt is not to be understood, however, that the graphophone is the only\r\nspeaking machine on the market, for about 250 patents have been granted\r\non phonographs and graphophones. The National Phonograph Company, under\r\nmany later patents granted to Mr. Edison, manufactures and sells the\r\nphonograph shown in Fig. 192, which is a very ingenious and effective\r\ninstrument. This modern form of phonograph is actuated either by\r\nelectricity or spring power, is regulated by a speed governor, and\r\nbifurcated ear tubes connect with the diaphragm case, which tubes are\r\nplaced in the ears when the instrument is operated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 193.--THE GRAMOPHONE RECORDER.]\r\n\r\nThe gramophone is also another speaking machine. This is the invention\r\nof Mr. E. Berliner and covered by him in patent No. 372,786, Nov. 8,\r\n1887. An illustration of the gramophone recorder is given in Fig. 193.\r\nInstead of a wax cylinder this machine employs a flat disc on which the\r\nrecord is formed as a volute spiral groove, gradually drawing toward the\r\ncenter. It is produced as follows: A zinc disc is covered by a thin film\r\nof acid resisting material, such as wax or grease, and is placed in a\r\nhorizontal pan, mounted to revolve as a turn table about a vertical\r\naxis. A stylus and diaphragm, with speaking tube attached, are arranged\r\nabove the disc, and when spoken into the vibrations of the diaphragm\r\ncause, through the stylus, a record to be traced through the wax, down\r\nto the zinc. As the waxed disc and pan are revolved, the stylus and\r\ndiaphragm are gradually moved by gears toward the center of the disc.\r\nWhile the record is being traced the waxed disc is kept flooded with\r\nalcohol from a glass jar, seen in the cut, to soften the film and\r\nprevent the clogging of the stylus. The disc, when completed, is then\r\nrinsed off and etched with acid, chromic acid being used, to prevent\r\nliberation of hydrogen bubbles. The etched disc is then electrotyped to\r\nform a matrix, and from this electrotype hard rubber duplicates of the\r\noriginal record are molded, which are capable of giving 1,000\r\nreproductions. These rubber discs are placed on the reproducing\r\ninstrument, which is arranged to cause the stylus to freely trail along\r\nin the spiral groove, and when the disc is rotated under the said stylus\r\nits record is converted into articulate speech. Such flat disc records\r\ngive quite loud reproductions, are not easily destroyed, and may be\r\ncompactly stored and transported. In the gramophone the diaphragm stands\r\nat right angles to the record disc and the stylus does not vibrate\r\nendwise to make a path of varying depth, as in the phonograph and\r\ngraphophone, but the stylus vibrates laterally and traces a little\r\nzigzag line.\r\n\r\nThe cost of a talking machine is from $5 to $150. The wax cylinders cost\r\nfrom 25 cents to $3.00, and the cylinders will hold a record of from 800\r\nto 1,200 words, equivalent to about three or four pages of print in an\r\noctavo volume. An important part of such machines is the motor, which\r\nmust maintain a uniform rate of speed, and much ingenuity has been\r\ndisplayed on this part of the machine. Probably the largest use of the\r\nphonograph or graphophone is for home amusement and exhibition purpose.\r\nThe coin operated, or “nickel-in-the-slot” machine, finds a popular\r\ndemand, while its utilitarian use as an amanuensis, or stenographer, is\r\nas yet a subordinate one.\r\n\r\nAlthough twenty-one years of age, and of full growth, the phonograph is\r\never a wonderfully new and impressive device. When listening to it for\r\nthe first time the conflict of emotions which it excites is difficult to\r\nanalyze. A voice full of human quality, of clear and familiar\r\nenunciation, and speaking in the most matter of fact way about the most\r\nmatter of fact things, proceeds from an insignificant and insensible bit\r\nof metal, presenting the apparently anomalous condition of speech\r\nwithout a speaker. When convinced that there is no trick, astonishment\r\nstruggles with admiration and a desire for a personal introduction. We\r\nspeak into it, and have the unique experience of listening to our own\r\nvoice emanating from a different part of the room, instead of our own\r\nmouths. It is really difficult to believe one’s own senses, and no\r\nwonder that it inspires the superstitious with a feeling of awe. If Mr.\r\nEdison had lived a few centuries earlier, and had produced such an\r\ninstrument, his life might have paid the penalty of his ingenuity, for\r\nwithout doubt he would have been classed as a wizard, and of close kin\r\nto the evil one.\r\n\r\nThe phonograph is the truth-telling and incontrovertible witness whose\r\nmemory is never at fault, and whose nerves are never discomposed by any\r\ncross-examination. As evidence in court its word cannot be doubted, and\r\nthe witness confronted by his own utterances from the phonograph must\r\nyield to its infallible dictum. The dying father, unable to write, may\r\ndictate to it his last will and testament, and leave a message for his\r\nloved ones, and long after the sod is green on his grave, that message\r\nwould still be audible, and fresh and true to all the tender inflections\r\nof the heart’s emotions. By its aid the Holy Father, at Rome, may give\r\nhis personal and audible blessing to his children throughout the world,\r\nthough separated by thousands of miles. Who can tell what stories of\r\ninteresting and instructive knowledge would be in our possession if the\r\nphonograph had appeared in the ages of the past, and its records had\r\nbeen preserved? The voices of our dead ancestors, whose portraits hang\r\non the wall, and the eloquent words of Demosthenes and Cicero would be\r\npreserved to us. In fact, we should be brought into vocal contact with\r\nthe world’s heroes, martyrs, saints, and sages, and all the great actors\r\nand teachers whose personalities have made history, and whose teachings\r\nhave given us our best ideals. But perhaps the most practical and best\r\ncharacterization of the phonograph is given in Mr. Edison’s own terse\r\nwords. He says: “In one sense it knows more than we know ourselves, for\r\nit retains the memory of many things which we forget, even though we\r\nhave said them. It teaches us to be careful of what we say, and I am\r\nsure makes men more brief, more businesslike, and more\r\nstraightforward.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nOPTICS.\r\n\r\n    EARLY TELESCOPES--THE LICK TELESCOPE--THE GRANDE LUNETTE--THE\r\n    STEREO-BINOCULAR FIELD GLASS--THE MICROSCOPE--THE SPECTROSCOPE--\r\n    POLARIZATION OF LIGHT--KALEIDOSCOPE--STEREOSCOPE--RANGE FINDER--\r\n    KINETOSCOPE AND MOVING PICTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\n“And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the\r\nlight that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.”\r\nThus early in the account of the creation is evidenced man’s\r\nappreciation of the value of vision. Of all the senses which place man\r\nin intelligent relation to his environment none is so important as\r\nsight. More than all the others does it establish our relation to the\r\nmaterial world. When the babe is born, and its little emancipated soul\r\nis brought in contact with the world, its wondering gaze sees the\r\npanorama of visible things touching its eyes, and it stretches forth its\r\ntiny arms in the vain effort to pluck the stars, apparently within its\r\nreach. Distance and time add their values to light and vision, and as\r\nhis life expands to greater fullness, the perspective of his existence\r\ncreeps into his consciousness, and he finds himself farther away, but\r\nstill peering beyond into the infinity of distance, searching for the\r\nvisible evidence of knowledge. From the earliest times man learned to\r\nspurn the groveling things of earth, and to delight his soul with the\r\nmarvelous infinity of the sky and its heavenly bodies. _Nunc ad astra_\r\nwas his ambitious cry, and in no field has his quest for knowledge been\r\nmore skillfully directed, faithfully maintained, or richly rewarded than\r\nin the study of astronomy. Many important discoveries in this field have\r\nbeen made in the Nineteenth Century, among which may be named the\r\ndiscovery of the planet Neptune by Adams, Leverrier and Galle in 1846;\r\nthe satellites of Neptune in 1846, and those of Saturn in 1848 by Mr.\r\nLassell; the two satellites of Mars by Prof. Asaph Hall in 1877; and the\r\ndiscovery of the so-called canals of Mars by Schiaparelli in 1877. But\r\nthe purpose of this work is to deal with material inventions rather than\r\nscientific discoveries, and the leading invention in optics is the\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\nWho invented the telescope is a question that cannot now be answered.\r\nFor many years Galileo was credited in popular estimation with having\r\nmade this invention in 1609. But it is now known that, while he built\r\ntelescopes, and discovered the mountains of the moon, the spots on the\r\nsun’s disk, the crescent phases of Venus, the four satellites of\r\nJupiter, the rings of Saturn, and made the first important astronomical\r\nobservations, the invention of the telescope, as an instrument, could\r\nnot be rightly claimed for him. Borelli credits it to Jansen &\r\nLippersheim, spectacle makers, of Middelburg, Holland, about 1590;\r\nDescartes credits it to James Metius; Humboldt says Hans Lippershey (or\r\nLaprey), a native of Wesel and a spectacle maker of Middelburg in 1608,\r\nnaming also Jacob Adriansz, sometimes called Metius and also Zacharias\r\nJansen.\r\n\r\nThe great impetus given to the study of astronomy by Galileo, in 1609,\r\nwas followed up by Huygens in 1655 with his improvement, by Gregory’s\r\nreflecting telescope of 1663, and Newton’s in 1668. In 1733 Chester More\r\nHall invented the achromatic object glass of crown and flint glass. In\r\n1758 John Dolland reinvented and introduced the same in the manufacture\r\nof telescopes. In 1779 Herschel built his reflecting telescope, and in\r\nMarch, 1781, he discovered the planet Uranus. In 1789 he built his great\r\nreflector. It was while the latter telescope was exploring the heavens\r\nthat the Nineteenth Century began, and in the early part of this century\r\nHerschel laid before the Royal Society a catalogue of many thousand\r\nnebulæ and clusters of stars. Among the great telescopes of the\r\nNineteenth Century may be mentioned that made in London in 1802 for the\r\nobservatory of Madrid, which cost £11,000; the great reflecting\r\ntelescope of the Earl of Rosse, erected at Parsonstown, in Ireland, in\r\n1842-45. This was 6 feet diameter, 54 feet focal length, and cost over\r\n£20,000; the magnificent equatorial telescopes set up at the National\r\nObservatories at Greenwich and Paris in 1860; Foucault’s reflecting\r\ntelescope at Paris, 1862, whose mirror was 31½ inches diameter, and\r\nfocal length 17¾ feet; Mr. R. S. Newall’s telescope, set up at Gateshead\r\nby Cookes, of York, in 1870; object glass, 25 inches, tube, 30 feet; Mr.\r\nA. Ainslie Common’s reflecting telescope, Ealing, Middlesex, 1879,\r\nmirror, 37½ inches diameter, tube, 20 feet; the telescope at the United\r\nStates Observatory, at Washington, 1873, object glass, 26 inches, tube,\r\n33 feet long; and the large refracting telescope by Howard Grubb, at\r\nDublin, for Vienna, 1881.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 194.--TELESCOPE AT LICK OBSERVATORY.]\r\n\r\nIn more recent times the great refracting telescope by Alvan Clark &\r\nSons, for the Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton, California, in 1888,\r\nattracted attention as superior to anything in existence up to that\r\ntime. This is shown in Fig. 194. The supporting column and base are of\r\niron, weighing twenty-five tons. This rests on a masonry foundation,\r\nwhich forms the tomb of James Lick, its founder. The tube is 52 feet\r\nlong, 4 feet diameter in the middle, tapering to a little over 3 feet at\r\nthe ends. The object glass is 36 inches in diameter, and weighs, with\r\nits cell, 530 lbs. The steel dome is 75 feet 4 inches in diameter, and\r\nthe weight of its moving parts is 100 tons. This instrument was\r\nperfectly equipped with all gauges, scales, photographic and\r\nspectroscope accessories, and fulfilled the condition imposed in the\r\ntrust deed of James Lick, of being “superior to and more powerful than\r\nany telescope made.” It is a giant among instruments of precision, and\r\nits ponderous aspect still asserts the dignity of its purpose, and\r\nimpresses even the frivolous visitor with a silent and thoughtful\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be understood, however, that the great Lick telescope still\r\nmaintains its supremacy. The Yerkes telescope, which was exhibited at\r\nthe World’s Fair Exposition in 1893, at Chicago, had an object glass of\r\n3.28 feet in diameter and a focal distance of 65 feet, and it moved\r\naround a central axis in a vast cupola or dome 78 feet in diameter. The\r\nGrand Equatorial of Gruenewald, at the recent Berlin Exposition, was\r\neven still larger, since its object glass was 3 feet 7 inches, or nearly\r\n2 inches larger than the Yerkes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 195.--GREAT TELESCOPE, PARIS EXPOSITION. 1900.]\r\n\r\nEven these great instruments have now been excelled in the Grande\r\nLunette, of the Paris Exposition, in 1900. When it is remembered that an\r\nincrease in the diameter of any circular body causes, for every\r\nadditional inch, a vastly disproportionate increase in the\r\ncross-sectional area and weight, it will readily be seen how handicapped\r\nthe instrument maker is in any increase in the power of such a\r\ntelescope. An increased diameter of a few inches in the glass lens means\r\nan enormous increase in the cross section, its weight and the\r\ndifficulties attending its successful casting free from imperfections,\r\nand the perfect grinding and polishing of the lens. An increased length\r\nof the tubular case of the telescope is liable to involve, from the\r\ngreat weight, a slight bending or springing out of axial alignment when\r\nsupported near the middle for equatorial adjustment, and a few feet\r\nincrease in the diameter of the massive and movable steel dome add\r\ngreatly to the weight and incidental difficulties of constructing and\r\ndelicately adjusting it. The great Lunette, see Fig. 195, changes\r\nentirely the method of manipulating the telescope, and also, in a\r\nmeasure, its principle of action, so as to avoid some of these\r\ndifficulties. Its tube, instead of being pointed upwardly through the\r\nslot of a movable dome, and made adjustable with the dome, is laid down\r\nhorizontally on a stationary base of supporting pillars, and an\r\nadjustable reflecting mirror and regulating mechanism, called a\r\n“siderostat,” is arranged at one end, to catch the view of the star, or\r\nmoon, and reflect it into the great tube, and through its lenses on to\r\nthe screen at the other end. The tube is 197 feet long, and the object\r\nglass or lens is a fraction over 4 feet in diameter. There are two of\r\nthese, which together cost $120,000. The siderostat is supported on a\r\nlarge cast iron frame, and is provided with clockwork and devices for\r\ncausing the mirror to follow the movement of the celestial object which\r\nis being viewed. The entire weight of the siderostat and base is 99,000\r\npounds, the movable part weighs 33,000 pounds, and the mirror and its\r\ncell weigh 14,740. The mirror itself is of glass, weighs 7,920 pounds,\r\nis 6.56 feet in diameter, and 10.63 inches thick. To facilitate the\r\nfree and sensitive adjustment of this great mirror its base floats in a\r\nreservoir of mercury. The entire cost of the instrument is said to be\r\nover 2,000,000 francs. With the wonderful strides of improvement in all\r\nfields of invention, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the\r\nrevelations in astronomy may keep pace with those of mundane interest,\r\nand that great discoveries may be made in the near future. The average\r\nindividual does not bother himself much about the calculation of\r\neclipses, or the laws which govern the movements of an erratic comet. He\r\nis, however, intensely personal and neighborly, and what he wants to\r\nknow is, Is Mars inhabited? and if so, are its denizens men, and may we\r\ncommunicate with them? The wonderful regularity of the so-called canals,\r\nof apparently intelligent design, already discovered on the surface of\r\nMars, has stimulated this neighborly curiosity into an expectant\r\ninterest, and who knows what marvelous introductions the modern\r\ntelescope may bring about?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 196.--PROF. ABBE’S STEREO-BINOCULAR.]\r\n\r\nMany minor improvements have been made in recent years in the form of\r\nthe telescope known as field and opera glasses. Probably the most\r\nimportant of these is the Stereo-Binocular, invented by Prof. Abbe, of\r\nGermany, and patented by him in that country in 1893, and also in the\r\nUnited States, June 22, 1897, No. 584,976. This gives a much increased\r\nfield, and also an increased stereoscopic effect, or conception of\r\nrelative distance, by having the object glasses wider apart than the\r\neyes of the observer. The field is also flatter, the instrument rendered\r\nvery much smaller and more compact, and no change of focus is required\r\nfor changing from near-by to remote objects. The rays of light, see Fig.\r\n196, enter the object glasses, strike a double reflecting prism, and are\r\nfirst thrown away from the observer, and then striking another double\r\nreflecting prism, arranged after Porro’s method, are returned to the\r\nobserver in line with the eye-piece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 197.--MODERN MICROSCOPE.]\r\n\r\n_The Microscope._--Just as the telescope reveals the infinity of the\r\ngreat world above and around us, so does the microscope reveal the\r\ninfinity of the little world around, about, and within us. Its origin,\r\nlike the telescope, is hidden in the dim distance of the past, but it is\r\nbelieved to antedate the telescope. Probably the dewdrop on a leaf\r\nconstituted the first microscope. The magnifying power of glass balls\r\nwas known to the Chinese, Japanese, Assyrians and Egyptians, and a lens\r\nmade of rock crystal was found among the ruins of Ninevah. The\r\nmicroscope is either single or compound. In the single the object is\r\nviewed directly. In the compound two or more lenses are so arranged that\r\nthe image formed by one is magnified by the others, and viewed as if it\r\nwere the object itself. The single microscope cannot be claimed by any\r\ninventor. The double or compound microscope was invented by Farncelli in\r\n1624, and it was in that century that the first important applications\r\nwere made for scientific investigation. Most of the investigations were\r\nmade, however, by the single microscope, and the names of Borelli,\r\nMalpighi, Lieberkuhn, Hooke, Leeuwenhoek, Swammerden, Lyonnet, Hewson\r\nand Ellis were conspicuous as the fathers of microscopy. For more than\r\ntwo hundred and fifty years the microscope has lent its magnifying aid\r\nto the eye, and step by step it has been gradually improved. Joseph J.\r\nLister’s aplanatic foci and compound objective, in 1829, was a notable\r\nimprovement in the first part of the century, and this has been followed\r\nup by contributions from various inventors, until the modern compound\r\nmicroscope, Fig. 197, is a triumph of the optician’s art, and an\r\ninstrument of wonderful accuracy and power. Its greatest work belongs to\r\nthe Nineteenth Century.\r\n\r\nMultiplying the dimensions of the smallest cells to more than a thousand\r\ntimes their size, it has brought into range of vision an unseen world,\r\ndeveloped new sciences, and added immensely to the stores of human\r\nknowledge. To the biologist and botanist it has yielded its revelations\r\nin cell structure and growth; to the physician its diagnosis in urinary\r\nand blood examinations; in histology and morbid secretions it is\r\ninvaluable; in geology its contribution to the knowledge of the physical\r\nhistory of the world is of equal importance; while in the study of\r\nbacteriology and disease germs it has so revolutionized our conception\r\nof the laws of health and sanitation, and the conditions of life and\r\ndeath, and is so intimately related to our well being, as to mark\r\nprobably the greatest era of progress and useful extension of knowledge\r\nthe world has ever known. In the useful arts, also, it figures in almost\r\nevery department; the jeweler, the engraver, the miner, the\r\nagriculturalist, the chemical manufacturer, and the food inspector, all\r\nmake use of its magnifying powers.\r\n\r\nTo the microscope the art of photography has lent its valuable aid, so\r\nthat all the revelations of the microscope are susceptible of\r\npreservation in permanent records, as photomicrographs. A curious, but\r\nvery practical, use of the microscope was made in the establishment of\r\nthe pigeon-post during the siege of Paris in 1870-71. Shut in from the\r\noutside world, the resourceful Frenchmen photographed the news of the\r\nday to such microscopic dimensions that a single pigeon could carry\r\n50,000 messages, which weighed less than a gramme. These messages were\r\nplaced on delicate films, rolled up, and packed in quills. The pigeons\r\nwere sent out in balloons, and flying back to Paris from the outer\r\nworld, carried these messages back and forth, and the messages, when\r\nreaching their destination, were enlarged to legible dimensions and\r\ninterpreted by the microscope. It is said that two and a half million\r\nmessages were in this way transmitted.\r\n\r\n_The Spectroscope._--To the popular comprehension, the best definition\r\nof any scientific instrument is to tell what it does. Few things,\r\nhowever, so tax the credulity of the uninformed as a description of the\r\nfunctions and possibilities of the spectroscope. To state that it tells\r\nwhat kind of materials there are in the sun and stars, millions of miles\r\naway, seems like an unwarranted attack upon one’s imagination, and yet\r\nthis is one of the things that the spectroscope does. A few commonplace\r\nobservations will help to explain its action. Every schoolboy has seen\r\nthe play of colors through a triangular prism of glass, as seen in Fig.\r\n198, and the older generation remembers the old-fashioned candelabras,\r\nwhich, with their brilliant pendants of cut glass cast beautiful colored\r\npatches on the wall, and whose dancing beauties delighted the souls of\r\nmany a boy and girl of fifty years ago. This spread of color is called\r\nthe _spectrum_, and it is with the spectrum that the spectroscope has to\r\ndeal. The white light of the sun is composed of the seven colors: red,\r\norange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. When a sunbeam falls\r\nupon a triangular prism of glass the beam is bent from its course at an\r\nangle, and the different colors of its light are deflected at different\r\nangles or degrees, and consequently, instead of appearing as white\r\nlight, the beam is spread out into a divergent wedge shape, that\r\nseparates the colors and produces what is called the spectrum. This\r\ndiscovery was made by Sir Isaac Newton, in 1675.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 198.--PRISM AND SPECTRUM.]\r\n\r\nIn 1802 Dr. Wollaston, in repeating Newton’s experiments, admitted the\r\nbeam of light through a very narrow slit, instead of a round hole, and\r\nnoticed that the spectrum, as spread out in its colors, was not a\r\ncontinuous shading from one color into another, but he found black lines\r\ncrossing the spectrum. These black lines were, in 1814, carefully mapped\r\nby a German optician, named Fraunhofer, and were found by him to be 576\r\nin number. The next step toward the spectroscope was made by Simms, an\r\noptician, in 1830, who placed a lens in front of the prism so that the\r\nslit was in the focus of the lens, and the light passing through the\r\nslit first passed through the lens, and then through the prism. This\r\nlens was called the “Collimating” lens. With these preliminary steps of\r\ndevelopment, Prof. Kirchhoff began in 1859 his great work of mapping the\r\nsolar spectrum, and he, in connection with Prof. Bunsen, found several\r\nthousand of the dark lines in the spectrum, and laid the foundation of\r\n_spectrum-analysis_, or the determination of the nature of substances\r\nfrom the spectra cast by them when in an incandescent state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 199.--KIRCHHOFF’S FOUR-PRISM SPECTROSCOPE.]\r\n\r\nThe form of Kirchhoff’s spectroscope is given in Fig. 199. The slit\r\nforming slide is seen on the far end of the tube A, and is shown in\r\nenlarged detached view on the right. The collimating lens is contained\r\nin the tube A. The beam of light entering the slit at the far end of the\r\ntube A, passes through the lens in that tube, and then passes\r\nsuccessively through the four triangular prisms on the table, and is\r\nsuccessively bent by these and thrown in the form of a spectrum into the\r\ntelescopic tube B, and is seen by the eye at the remote end of said\r\ntube B. The greater the number of prisms the wider is the dispersion of\r\nthe rays and the longer is the spectrum, and the more easily studied are\r\nthe peculiar lines which Wollaston and Fraunhofer found crossing it. It\r\nwas the presence of these black lines on the spectrum which led to the\r\ndevelopment of the spectroscope and established its significance and\r\nvalue. The work which the spectroscope does is simply to form an\r\nextended spectrum, but this spectrum varies with the different kinds of\r\nlight admitted through the slit, the different kinds of light showing\r\ndifferent arrangement of colored bands and dark lines, and such a\r\ndefinite relation between the light of various incandescing elementary\r\nbodies and their spectra has been found to exist, that the casting of a\r\ndefinite spectrum from the sun or stars indicates with certainty the\r\npresence in the sun or stars of the incandescing element which produces\r\nthat spectrum. This application of the spectroscope is called\r\n_spectrum-analysis_, and by rendering any substance incandescent in the\r\nflame of a Bunsen burner, and directing the light of its incandescence\r\nthrough the spectroscope, its spectrum gives the basis of intelligent\r\nchemical identification. So delicate is its test that it has been\r\ncalculated by Profs. Kirchhoff and Bunsen that the eighteen-millionth\r\npart of a grain of sodium may be detected.\r\n\r\nThe useful applications of the spectroscope are found principally in\r\nastronomy and the chemical laboratory, but some industrial applications\r\nhave also been made of it in metallurgical operations, as, for instance,\r\nin determining the progress of the Bessemer process of making steel, and\r\nalso for testing alloys. Many hitherto unknown metals have also been\r\ndiscovered through the agency of the spectroscope, among which may be\r\nnamed caesium, rubidium, thallium, and indium.\r\n\r\nThe field of optics is so large that many interesting branches can\r\nreceive only a casual mention. The polarization of light, first noticed\r\nby Bartholinus in 1669, and by Huygens in 1678, in experiments in double\r\nrefraction with crystals of Iceland spar, were followed in the\r\nNineteenth Century by the discoveries of Malus, Arago, Fresnel,\r\nBrewster, and Biot. Malus, in 1808, discovered polarization by\r\nreflection from polished surfaces; Arago, in 1811, discovered colored\r\npolarization; Nicol, in 1828, invented the prism named after him. The\r\nKaleidoscope was invented by Sir David Brewster in 1814, and British\r\npatent No. 4,136 granted him July 10, 1817, for the same. The reflecting\r\nstereoscope was invented by Wheatstone in 1838, and the lenticular form,\r\nas now generally used, was invented by Sir David Brewster in the year\r\n1849.\r\n\r\nAmong the more recent inventions of importance in optics may be\r\nmentioned the Fiske range finder (Patent No. 418,510, December 31,\r\n1889), for enabling a gunner to direct his cannon upon the target when\r\nits distance is unknown, or even when obscured by fog or smoke. The\r\nBeehler solarometer (Patent No. 533,340, January 29, 1895), is also an\r\nimportant scientific invention, which has for its object to determine\r\nthe position, or the compass error, of a ship at sea when the horizon is\r\nobscured. There is also in late years a great variety of entertaining\r\nand instructive apparatus in photography, and improvements in the\r\nstereopticon and magic lantern.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of the latter is the Kinetoscope, for producing the\r\nso-called moving pictures, in which the magic lantern and modern results\r\nin the photographic art, have wrought wonders on the screen. The\r\nold-fashioned magic lantern projections were interesting and instructive\r\nobject lessons, but modern invention has endowed the pictures with all\r\nthe atmosphere and naturalness of real living scenes, in which the\r\nfigures move and act, and the scenes change just as they do in real\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe foundation principle upon which these moving pictures exist is that\r\nof persistence of vision. If a succession of views of the same object in\r\nmotion is made, with the moving object in each consecutive figure\r\nchanged just a little, and progressively so in a constantly advancing\r\nattitude in a definite movement, and those different positions are\r\nrapidly presented in sequence to the eye in detached views, the figures\r\nappear to constantly move through the changing position. The theory of\r\nthe duration of visible impressions was taught by Leonardo da Vinci in\r\nthe fifteenth century, and practical advantage has been taken of the\r\nsame in a variety of old-fashioned toys, known as the phenakistoscope,\r\nthaumatrope, zoetrope, stroboscope, rotascope, etc.\r\n\r\nThe phenakistoscope was invented by Dr. Roget, and improved by Plateau\r\nin 1829, and also by Faraday. A circular disk, bearing a circular series\r\nof figures is mounted on a handle to revolve. The figures following each\r\nother show consecutively a gradual progression, or change in position.\r\nThe disk has radial slits around its periphery, and is held with its\r\nfigured face before a looking glass. When the reflection is viewed in\r\nthe looking glass through the slits, the figures rapidly passing in\r\nsuccession before the slits appear to have the movements of life. The\r\nthaumatrope, which originated with Sir John Herschel, consists of a thin\r\ndisc, bearing on opposite sides two associated objects, such as a bird\r\nand a cage, or a horse and a man. This, when rotated about its diameter,\r\nto bring alternately the bird and cage into view, appears to bring the\r\nbird into the cage, or to put the rider on the horse’s back, as the case\r\nmay be. The zoetrope, described in the _Philosophical Magazine_,\r\nJanuary, 1834, employs the general principle of the phenakistoscope,\r\nexcept that, instead of a disc before a looking glass, an upright\r\nrotating drum or cylinder is employed, and has its figures on the\r\ninside, and is viewed, when rotating, through a succession of vertical\r\nslits in the drum.\r\n\r\nThe earliest patents found in this art are the British patent to Shaw,\r\nNo. 1,260, May 22, 1860; United States patents, Sellers, No. 31,357,\r\nFebruary 5, 1861, and Lincoln, No. 64,117, April 23, 1867. In Brown’s\r\npatent, No. 93,594, August 10, 1869, the magic lantern was applied to\r\nthe moving pictures, and Muybridge’s photos of trotting horses in 1872,\r\nfollowed by instantaneous photography, which enabled a great number of\r\nviews to be taken of moving objects in rapid succession, laid the\r\nfoundation for the modern art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOOTING GLASS BALLS.\r\n\r\nFIRING DISAPPEARING GUN.\r\n\r\nFIG. 200.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 200 is shown a succession of instantaneous photographs of a\r\nsportsman shooting a glass ball, and the firing of a disappearing gun. A\r\nmultiplicity of views extending through all the phases of these\r\nmovements, when successively presented in order, before a magic lantern\r\nprojecting apparatus, gives to the eye the striking semblance of real\r\nmovements. In practice these views are taken by special cameras, and are\r\nprinted on long transparent ribbons that contain many hundreds, and even\r\nthousands of the views. Edison’s Kinetoscope is covered by patent No.\r\n493,426, March 14, 1893, and his instrument known as the Vitascope, is\r\none of those used for projecting the views upon a screen. In Fig. 201 a\r\nsimilar instrument, called the Biograph, is shown, in which the seeming\r\napproach of the locomotive makes those who witness it shudder with the\r\napparent danger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 201.--BIOGRAPH IN THE THEATRE.]\r\n\r\nTo secure the best results, the ribbon with its views should remain with\r\na figure the longest possible time between the light and the lens, and\r\nthe shifting to the next view should be as nearly instantaneous as\r\npossible. This problem has been admirably solved by C. F. Jenkins, who,\r\nin 1894, devised means for accomplishing it, and was one of the first,\r\nif not the first, to successfully project the views on a large screen\r\nadapted to public exhibitions. His apparatus is shown in Fig. 202. An\r\nelectric motor, seen on the left, drives, through a belt and pulley, a\r\ncountershaft, and also through a worm gear turns another shaft parallel\r\nto the countershaft, and bearing a sprocket pulley, whose teeth\r\npenetrate little marginal holes in the ribbon of views, and, drawing it\r\ndown from the reel above, deliver it to the receiving reel on the right.\r\nOn the end of the countershaft, just in front of the sprocket wheel, is\r\na revolving crank pin or spool, which intermittently beats down the\r\nribbon of views, causing the latter to advance through the vertical\r\nguides in front of the lens by a succession of jerks. This holds each\r\nview for a maximum period before the lens, and then suddenly jerks the\r\nribbon to bring the next view into position. In the Kinetoscope the\r\nanimated pictures not only present the movements of life, but, by a\r\ncombination with the phonograph, the audible speech, or music fitting\r\nthe occasion, is also presented at the same time, making a marvelous\r\nsimulation of real life to both the eye and the ear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 202.--JENKINS’ PHANTASCOPE.]\r\n\r\nAmong the latest promises of the inventor is the “Distance Seer,” or\r\ntelectroscope, which, it is said, enables one to see at any distance\r\nover electric wires, just as one may telegraph or telephone over them.\r\nThe surprises of the Nineteenth Century have been so many and so\r\nastounding, and the principles of this invention are so far correct,\r\nthat it would be dogmatic to say that this hope may not be realized.\r\n\r\nTo the sum total of human knowledge no department of science has\r\ncontributed more than that of optics. With the telescope man has climbed\r\ninto the limitless space of the heavens, and ascertained the infinite\r\nvastness of the universe. The flaming sun which warms and vitalizes the\r\nworld, is found more than ninety millions of miles away. The nearest\r\nfixed stars visible to the naked eye are more than 200,000 times the\r\ndistance of the sun, and their light, traveling at the rate of 190,000\r\nmiles a second, requires more than three years to reach us. Although so\r\nfar away, their size, distance, and constitution have been ascertained,\r\nand their movements are scheduled with such accuracy that the going and\r\ncoming thereof are brought to the exactness of a railroad time table.\r\nThe astronomer predicts an eclipse, and on the minute the spheres swing\r\ninto line, verifying, beyond all doubt, the correctness of the laws\r\npredicated for their movements. The wonders of the telescope, the\r\nmicroscope, and the spectroscope are, however, but suggestions of what\r\nwe may still expect, for science abundantly teaches that the eye may yet\r\nsee what to the eye is now invisible, and that light exists in what may\r\nnow seem darkness.\r\n\r\nNo man may say with certainty what thought was uppermost in Goethe’s\r\nmind when, grappling in the final struggle with the King of Terrors, he\r\nexclaimed “Mehr licht!” It may be that it was but the wish to dispel the\r\ngathering gloom of his dimming senses, or perchance the unfolding of an\r\nilluminated vision of a brighter threshold, but certain it is that no\r\nwords so voice the aspirations of an enlightened humanity as that one\r\ncry of “More light!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n    EXPERIMENTS OF WEDGEWOOD AND DAVY--NIÉPCE’S HELIOGRAPHY--DAGUERRE\r\n    AND THE DAGUERREOTYPE--FOX TALBOT MAKES FIRST PROOFS FROM\r\n    NEGATIVES--SIR JOHN HERSCHEL INTRODUCES GLASS PLATES--THE COLLODION\r\n    PROCESS--SILVER AND CARBON PRINTS--AMBROTYPES--EMULSIONS--DRY\r\n    PLATES--THE KODAK CAMERA--THE PLATINOTYPE--PHOTOGRAPHY IN COLORS--\r\n    PANORAMA CAMERAS--PHOTO-ENGRAVING AND PHOTO-LITHOGRAPHY--HALF TONE\r\n    ENGRAVING.\r\n\r\n“Art’s proudest triumph is to imitate nature.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen nature paints she does so with the brush of beauty, dipped in the\r\npigment of truth. The tender affection of a ray of light touches the\r\nheart of a rose, brings a blush to its cheek, and life, becoming the\r\nbride of chemical affinity, blooms into surpassing beauty and\r\nloveliness. Photography is closely allied to nature’s painting, for just\r\nas light brings into existence nature’s living beauties, so does light\r\nfix, preserve, and perpetuate these beauties by the same subtile and\r\nmysterious agency of a quickened chemical affinity. Photography is both\r\nan art and a science, and as such is both beautiful and true. It is an\r\nart intimately associated with the tenderest affections of the human\r\nheart in keeping alive its precious memories. By it the youthful\r\nsweetheart of long ago, the loving face of the departed mother, and the\r\ncherished form of the dead child are brought back to us in familiar\r\npresence, while our great men have become the every-day friends and\r\nideals of the common people. What an enrichment and satisfaction it\r\nwould have added to our lives if the art had been coeval with history,\r\nand all the world’s exalted scenes and faces had come to us through the\r\ncamera with the knowledge of absolute truth and fidelity. But not only\r\nin portraiture is photography a great art, for it catches the stately\r\npose of the mountain, the grandeur of the sea, the beauty of the forest,\r\nor the majesty of Niagara Falls, and brings them all home to us, even to\r\nthe vision of the bed-ridden invalid. The camera alike records the\r\nsecrets of the starry heavens and the bacteria of the microscopic world.\r\nHanging on the tail of a kite it photographs the face of mother earth,\r\nand, acting quicker than the lightning, it catches and defines the path\r\nof that erratic flash. It plays the part of a private detective, and its\r\ntestimony in court is never doubted. The architect, engineer, and\r\nillustrator find it in constant requisition. By the aid of the Roentgen\r\nRays, it locates a bullet in a wounded soldier, and takes a picture of\r\none’s spinal column. In fact, it sees and records things both visible\r\nand invisible, acts with the rapidity of thought, and is never mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe art of photography, named from the two Greek words φωτος γραφη (the\r\nwriting of light), is a comparatively new one, and belongs entirely to\r\nthe Nineteenth Century. It was known to the ancient alchemists that\r\n“horn silver” (fused chloride of silver) would blacken on exposure to\r\nlight, but there was neither any clear understanding of the nature of\r\nthis action, nor any application made of it prior to the year 1800. We\r\nnow know that the art of photography is dependent upon the actinic\r\neffect of certain of the rays of the spectrum upon certain chemical\r\nsalts, notably those of silver and chromic acid, in connection with\r\norganic matter. The rays which have this effect are the blue and violet\r\nrays at one end of the spectrum, and even invisible rays beyond the\r\nviolet, the red and yellow rays having little or no such actinic effect.\r\n\r\nThat which made photography possible for the Nineteenth Century was the\r\nphilosophical observation of Scheele, in 1777, upon the decomposing\r\ninfluence of light on the salts of silver, and the superior activity of\r\nthe violet rays of the spectrum over the others in producing this\r\neffect. In 1801 Ritter proved the existence of such invisible rays\r\nbeyond the violet end of the visible spectrum by the power they\r\npossessed of blackening chloride of silver.\r\n\r\n_Earliest Application of Principles._--The first attempt to render the\r\nblackening of silver salts by light available for artistic purposes, was\r\nmade by Wedgewood and Davy in 1802. A sheet of white paper was saturated\r\nwith a solution of nitrate of silver, and the shadow of the figure\r\nintended to be copied was projected upon it. Where the shadow fell the\r\npaper remained white, while the surrounding exposed parts darkened under\r\nthe sun’s rays. There was, however, no means of fixing such a picture,\r\nand in time the white parts would also turn black.\r\n\r\n_Introduction of Camera._--The camera obscura, a very old invention\r\ndesigned for the use of artists in copying from nature, was at a very\r\nearly period brought into this art, but it was found that the chemicals\r\nemployed by Wedgewood and Davy were not sufficiently sensitive to be\r\naffected by its subdued light. In 1814, however, Joseph Nicéphore\r\nNiépce, of Chalôns, invented a process that utilized the camera, and\r\nwhich was called “Heliography,” or sun drawing. In 1827 he discarded\r\nthe use of silver salts, and employed a resin known as “Bitumen of\r\nJudea” (asphaltum). A plate was coated with a solution of this resin and\r\nexposed. The light acting upon the plate rendered the resin insoluble\r\nwhere exposed, and left it soluble under the shadows. Hence, when\r\ntreated with an oleaginous solvent the shadows dissolved out, and the\r\nlights, represented by the undissolved resin, formed a picture, which\r\nwas in reality a permanent negative. The process, however, was slow,\r\nrequiring some hours.\r\n\r\n_The Daguerreotype._--In 1829 Niépce and Daguerre became partners, and\r\nin 1839, after the death of the elder Niépce, the process named after\r\nDaguerre was perfected (British patent No. 8,194, of 1839). He abandoned\r\nthe resin as a sensitive material, and went back to the salts of silver.\r\nHe employed a polished silver surfaced plate, and exposed it to the\r\naction of the vapors of iodine, so as to form a layer of iodide of\r\nsilver upon the surface, which rendered it very sensitive. By a short\r\nexposure in the camera an effect was produced, not visible to the eye,\r\nbut appearing when the plate was subjected to the vapor of mercury. This\r\nprocess reduced the time required from hours to minutes, and as it\r\ninvolved the production of a latent image, which was subsequently\r\ndeveloped by a chemical agent, it represented practically the beginning\r\nof the photographic art as practiced to-day. Daguerre sought also to\r\npermanently fix his pictures, but this was accomplished only imperfectly\r\nuntil 1839, when Sir John Herschel made known the properties of the\r\nhyposulphites for dissolving the salts of silver. In 1844 Hunt\r\nintroduced the protosulphate of iron as a developer.\r\n\r\n_Production of Positive Proofs from Negatives._--This was first done by\r\nMr. Fox Talbot, of England, between 1834 and 1839. In his first\r\ncommunication to the Royal Society, in January, 1839, it was directed\r\nthat the paper should be dipped first in a solution of chloride of\r\nsodium, and then in nitrate of silver, which, by reaction, produced, on\r\nthe face of the paper, chloride of silver, which was more sensitive to\r\nthe light than nitrate of silver. The object to be reproduced was laid\r\nin contact with the prepared paper, and exposed to the light until a\r\ncopy was produced which was a negative, having the lights and shadows\r\nreversed. A second sheet was then prepared, and the first or negative\r\nimpression was laid upon it, and used as a stencil to produce a second\r\nprint which, by a reversal of the lights and shadows, formed an exact\r\nreproduction of the original. In 1841, British patent No. 8,842 was\r\nobtained by Mr. Talbot, for what he called the “Calotype,” and which was\r\nafterward known as the “Talbotype.” A sheet of paper was first coated\r\nwith iodide of silver, by soaking it alternately in iodide of potassium\r\nand nitrate of silver, and was then washed with a solution of gallic\r\nacid containing nitrate of silver, by which the sensitiveness to light\r\nwas increased. An exposure of some seconds or minutes, according to the\r\nbrightness of the light, produced an impression upon the plate, which,\r\nwhen treated with a fresh portion of gallic acid and nitrate of silver,\r\ndeveloped into the image. After being fixed it formed a negative from\r\nwhich any number of prints might be obtained. The Talbot process\r\nrepresented a great advance in this art. Glass plates to retain the\r\nsensitive film were introduced by Sir John Herschel in 1839, and were a\r\ngreat improvement over the paper negatives, which latter, from lack of\r\ntransparency and uniformity in texture, had prevented fine definition\r\nand sharpness of outline. Blue printing was also invented by Sir John\r\nHerschel in 1842, and he was the first to apply the term “negative” in\r\nphotography. In 1848 M. Niépce de St. Victor, a nephew of Daguerre’s\r\nformer partner, applied to the glass a film of albumen to receive the\r\nsensitive silver coating.\r\n\r\n_Collodion Process._--The most important step in the preparation of the\r\nnegative was the application of collodion. This is a solution of\r\npyroxilin in ether and alcohol, which rapidly evaporates and leaves a\r\nthin film adhering to the glass. M. Le Gray, of Paris, was the first to\r\nsuggest collodion for this purpose, but Mr. Scott Archer, of London, in\r\n1851, was the first to carry it out practically. A clean plate of glass\r\nis coated with collodion sensitized with iodides of potassium, etc., and\r\nis then immersed in a solution of nitrate of silver. Metallic silver\r\ntakes the place of potassium, forming insoluble iodide of silver on the\r\nfilm. The plate is then exposed and the latent image developed by an\r\naqueous solution of pyrogallic acid, or protosulphate of iron. When\r\nsufficiently developed, the plate is washed, and the image fixed by\r\ndissolving the unacted-upon iodide of silver with a solution of cyanide\r\nof potassium or hyposulphite of soda. This completed the negative or\r\nstencil from which the positives are printed by passing rays of light\r\nthrough it upon sensitive paper.\r\n\r\n_The Ambrotype_ succeeded the Daguerreotype, and was produced by making\r\na very thin negative by under exposure on glass, using the collodion\r\nprocess, and, after drying, backing the glass with black asphaltum\r\nvarnish or black velvet, causing the dense portions of the negative to\r\nappear white by reflected light, and the transparent portions black.\r\nSuch pictures were quickly made, and were much in vogue forty years ago,\r\nbut are now obsolete. A modification of the ambrotype, however, still\r\nsurvives in what is known as the “tin-type” or “ferro-type.” In the\r\ntin-type the collodion picture is made directly upon a very thin iron\r\nplate, covered with black enamel, which both protects the plate from\r\nthe action of the chemicals in the bath, and forms the equivalent of the\r\nblack background of the ambrotype.\r\n\r\n_Silver Printing._--A sheet of paper, previously treated with a solution\r\nof chloride of sodium and dried, is sensitized in an alkaline bath of\r\nnitrate of silver. When the paper is exposed under a negative, the light\r\nthrough the transparent parts of the negative reduces the silver,\r\nconverting the chloride, it is supposed, into a metallic sub-chloride of\r\nsilver which becomes dark or black, and constitutes the main portion of\r\nthe picture. The image is then fixed by dissolving out the chloride of\r\nsilver unaltered by light in a bath of hyposulphite of soda. After\r\nfixation, the image is well washed in several changes of water to\r\neliminate all traces of the hyposulphite of soda and prevent the\r\nsubsequent fading of the darkened portions of the picture and the\r\nyellowing of the whites. If the printed image is immediately fixed, it\r\nwill have a red color. To avoid this it is washed first in water and\r\nthen immersed in a chloride of gold toning bath and fixed.\r\n\r\n_The Platinotype Process_ is one in which potassium chloroplatinite and\r\nferric oxalate are converted by light into the ferrous state, and\r\nmetallic platinum is reduced when in contact with the ferrous oxalate of\r\npotash solution. The unacted upon portions are dissolved out by dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid, leaving a black permanent image. This process is\r\ncharacterized by simplicity, sensitiveness in action, permanence of\r\nprint, and a peculiarly soft and artistic quality in the picture.\r\nBritish Patent No. 2,011, of 1873, to Willis, is the first disclosure of\r\nthe platinotype.\r\n\r\n_Carbon Printing_ is a process in which lampblack or other\r\nindestructible pigment is mixed with the chemicals to render the\r\nphotograph more stable against fading from the gradual decomposition of\r\nits elements. Mungo Ponton, in 1838, discovered the sensitive quality of\r\npotassium bichromate, which led up to carbon printing. Becquerel and\r\nPoitevin, in Paris, in 1855, were the first to experiment in this\r\ndirection, and Fargier, Swan, and Johnson were successors who made\r\nvaluable contributions.\r\n\r\n_Emulsions._--A photographic emulsion is a viscous liquid, such as\r\ncollodion or a solution of gelatine, containing a sensitive silver salt\r\nwith which the glass plate is at once coated, instead of coating the\r\nplate with collodion or gelatine, and then immersing it in a sensitizing\r\nbath. The desirability of emulsions was recognized as early as 1850 by\r\nGustave Le Gray, and in 1853 by Gaudin. Collodion emulsion with bromide\r\nof silver was invented by Sayce and made known in 1864. In 1871 Maddox\r\npublished his first notice of gelatine emulsion, and in 1873 the\r\ngelatine emulsions of Burgess were advertised for sale. In 1878 Mr.\r\nCharles Bennett brought out gelatino-bromide emulsion of extreme\r\nsensitiveness, by the application of heat, and from this time gelatine\r\nbegan to supersede all other organic media.\r\n\r\n_Dry Plates_ were a great improvement over the old wet process, with its\r\ntray for baths, its bottles of chemicals, and other accessories.\r\nEspecially was this the case with out of door work, which heretofore had\r\ninvolved the carrying along of much unwieldy and inconvenient\r\nparaphernalia. With the dry plate process only the camera and the plates\r\nwere needed, and this step marks the beginning of the spread of the art\r\namong amateurs, and the great snap-shot era of photography, growing into\r\na distinct movement about the year 1888, has since spread over the\r\nentire world. The first practical dry plate process (collodion-albumen)\r\nwas published in 1855 by Dr. J. M. Taupenot, a French scientist.\r\nRussell, in 1862; Sayce, in 1864; Captain Abney, for photographing the\r\ntransit of Venus in 1874; Rev. Canon Beechey, of England, in 1875; Prof.\r\nJohn W. Draper, of the University of New York, and the Eastman Walker\r\nCompany, of Rochester, were the chief promoters of dry plate\r\nphotography. The practical introduction began about 1862 with the\r\napplication of the alkaline developer.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the photographic art may be approximately noted as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n         _Process._                 _Time Required._     _Introduced._\r\n  Heliography                      6 hours’ exposure         1814\r\n  Daguerreotype                   30 minutes’ exposure       1839\r\n  Calotype or Talbotype            3 minutes’ exposure       1841\r\n  Collodion process               10 seconds’ exposure       1851\r\n  Collodion emulsion (dry plate)  15 seconds’ exposure       1864\r\n  Gelatine emulsion (dry plate)    1 second exposure         1878\r\n\r\n_Mechanical Development._--The photographic camera is but an adaptation\r\nof the optical principles of the old camera obscura, which has been\r\ncredited to various persons, including Roger Bacon in 1297, Baptista\r\nPorta about 1569, and others. The essential elements of the camera\r\nobscura are a dark chamber, having in one end a perforation containing a\r\nlens, and opposite it on the back of the chamber a screen upon which an\r\nimage of the object is projected by the lens for the purpose of enabling\r\nit to be directly traced by a pencil. The photographic camera,\r\nintroduced by Daguerre in 1839, adds to the camera obscura some means\r\nfor adjusting the distance between the lens and the screen on which the\r\nimage falls. This was accomplished by making the dark chamber adjustable\r\nin length by forming it in two telescopic sections sliding over each\r\nother, and in later years by the well-known bellows arrangement. A\r\nluminous image of any object placed in front of the lens is thrown in an\r\ninverted position upon the screen, which is of ground glass, to permit\r\nthe image to be seen in focusing. When the proper focus on this ground\r\nglass is obtained a sensitive plate is put in the plane of this screen\r\nto receive the image.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 203.--KODAK.]\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to trace all the steps of development of the camera\r\nwhich have brought it to its present perfection. Most of the\r\nimprovements have had relation to the lens in correcting chromatic and\r\nspherical aberration, and in shutters for regulating exposure, in stops\r\nfor shutting out the oblique rays and holders for the sensitive plate.\r\n\r\nThe “Iris” shutter, so-called from its resemblance in function to the\r\niris of the eye, consists of a series of tangentially arranged plates\r\nwhich open or close a central opening symmetrically from all sides.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary camera of the photographic artist is too familiar an object\r\nto require special illustration. It has been looked into by the rich and\r\nthe poor, and the high and the low, all over the whole world. Between\r\nthe traveling outfit, and the “look pleasant, please!” of the\r\nperipatetic artist, and the handsome studios of the cities, it is hard\r\nto find an individual in the civilized world who has not posed before\r\nits lens. Through its agency the great man of the day has found himself\r\nin evidence everywhere; the country maiden has many times experienced\r\nthe delicious thrill of satisfied vanity as she posed before it, and the\r\nsuperstitious savage is paralyzed with fear lest the mysterious thing\r\nshould steal his soul.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 204.--FOLDING KODAK.]\r\n\r\nIn 1851 the first instantaneous views were made by Mr. Cady and Mr.\r\nBeckers, of New York, and also by Mr. Talbot, who employed as a flash\r\nlight a spark from a Leyden jar. In 1864 magnesium light was employed by\r\nMr. Brothers, of Manchester, for photographic purposes, and about 1876-8\r\nVan der Weyde made use of the electric light for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThe _roller slide_, or roll film, was invented by A. J. Melhuish, in\r\nEngland, in 1854 (British patent No. 1,139, of 1854). The films were,\r\nhowever, of paper. In 1856 Norris produced sensitized dry films of\r\ncollodion or gelatine (British patent No. 2,029, of 1856). In later\r\nyears apparatus for utilizing the roll film has been greatly improved\r\nand extensively applied by Eastman, Walker & Co., of Rochester, N. Y.\r\n\r\nAbout 1888 a new thing in the photographic world made its appearance. It\r\nwas a little black leather-covered rectangular box, about six inches\r\nlong, with a sort of blind eye at one end closed by a cylindrical\r\nshutter, substantially as seen in Fig. 203. This shutter was wound up by\r\na spring operated by a pull cord. In the back of the box was a film or\r\nribbon of sensitized paper wound upon one spool, and unwinding therefrom\r\nand winding onto another spool, and being distended as it passed so as\r\nto form a flat surface which was directly in rear of the lens. A thumb\r\npiece or key on the top, and a push button on the side, were the only\r\nsuggestions of the operative mechanism within. When the button was\r\npressed the shutter for an instant passed from in front of the lens, and\r\nas quickly covered it again, but in this brief interval an image had\r\nbeen flashed upon the sensitive ribbon or film, and a snap-shot picture\r\nwas taken. By a simple movement of the thumb piece or key, the receiving\r\nroll was made to take up the exposed section of the sensitive film and\r\nbring another section into the range of the lens, for a repetition of\r\nthe operation. This little instrument was slung in a case looking like a\r\ncartridge box, and its sensitive roll was able to receive 100 successive\r\npictures. When the roll was exhausted, it was removed and developed in a\r\ndark room. The device was placed upon the market by the Eastman Company,\r\nand it was called the “Kodak.” The advertisement of the company, that\r\n“You press the button and we do the rest,” was soon realized to be\r\nfounded in fact, and in a short while the great era of snap-shot\r\nphotography had set in. To-day this form of camera is a part of the\r\nluggage of every tourist, traveler, scientist, and dilletante. In fact,\r\nit has become the familiar scientific toy of man, woman, and child,\r\ninteresting, instructive, and useful to all. In Fig. 204 is shown a\r\nmodern form of Kodak, which is made in various sizes and is foldable for\r\ncompact and convenient portability.\r\n\r\nA very convenient and useful development in films is to be found in the\r\ncartridge system, by which the film may be placed in and removed from\r\nthe camera in broad daylight. The film has throughout its length a\r\nbacking of black paper which extends far enough beyond the ends of the\r\nfilm to allow it to be unwound, so far, in making connection with the\r\nroll holder, without exposing the film to light, and also to allow it to\r\nbe removed without exposure to light, after all the exposures have been\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 205.--HAND PREMO.]\r\n\r\nAmong the many other ingenious and useful hand cameras may be mentioned\r\nthe “Premo,” made by the Rochester Optical Company, and shown in Fig.\r\n205. The “Premo” is arranged for either snap-shot or time exposure, is\r\nadapted to be either held in the hand or mounted upon a tripod, and is\r\nfurnished for use either with glass plates or roll films. In Fig. 206 is\r\nshown the “Premo” for stereoscopic work, in which two pictures are taken\r\nat once, a sufficient distance from each other to produce the effect of\r\nbinocular vision and give the appearance of relief when viewed through\r\nthe stereoscope. Brett’s British patent No. 1,629, of 1853, appears to\r\nbe the earliest description of a stereoscopic camera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 206.--STEREOSCOPIC CAMERA.]\r\n\r\nThere have been 2,000 United States patents granted in photography, most\r\nof which have been taken in the past thirty years, and great efficiency\r\nand detail in both the chemical and mechanical branches of the art have\r\nbeen obtained.\r\n\r\nThe useful applications of the art have been numerous and varied.\r\n_Portrait making_ is probably the largest field. This was first\r\nsuccessfully accomplished in 1839 by Professor Morse, of telegraph fame,\r\nworking with Prof. John W. Draper, of the University of New York.\r\n\r\n_Celestial Photography_ began with Prof. Draper’s photograph of the moon\r\nin March, 1840, and Prof. Bond, of Cambridge, Mass., in 1851. In 1872\r\nProf. Draper photographed the spectra of the stars, and in 1880-81 the\r\nnebulæ of Orion, and in 1887 the Photographic Congress of Astronomers of\r\nthe World, organized in Paris, began the work of photographing the\r\nentire heavens. In late years notable work has been done at the Lick\r\nObservatory by Prof. Holden. In 1861 Mr. Thompson, of Weymouth,\r\nphotographed the bottom of the sea, and Prof. O. N. Rood, of Troy, N.\r\nY., the same year described his application of it to the microscope. In\r\n1871 criminals were ordered to be photographed in England, and in\r\nAmerica the Rogues’ Gallery became an institution in New York as early\r\nas 1857, ambrotypes being first used. In 1876 the Adams Cabinet for\r\nholding and displaying the photos was invented. To-day the New York\r\ncollection amounts to nearly 30,000, while that of the National Bureau\r\nof Identification at Chicago approximates 100,000. It is a striking\r\nillustration of the law of compensation that the counterfeiter who\r\ninvokes the aid of photography to copy a bank note is, by the same\r\nagency of his photo in the Rogues’ Gallery, identified and convicted.\r\n\r\n_Photography in Colors_ has been the goal of artists and scientists in\r\nthis field for many years. Robt. Hunt, in England, in 1843, and Edmond\r\nBecquerel, in France, in 1848, made evanescent photographs in colors,\r\nbut little progress was made until about the last decade of the\r\nNineteenth Century. Franz Veress in 1890, F. E. Ives (United States\r\npatent No. 432,530, July 22, 1890), W. Kurtz (United States patent No.\r\n498,396, May 30, 1893), Gabriel Lippmann in 1892 and 1896, Ives in 1892,\r\nM. Lumière in 1893, Dr. Joly in 1895, M. Villedien Chassagne, and Dr.\r\nAdrien, M. Dansac and M. Bennetto, all in 1897, represent active workers\r\nin this field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 207.--PANORAM-KODAK.]\r\n\r\nAmong recent developments of the camera may be mentioned the wide angle\r\nlens, which permits larger images to be made on the plate from small\r\nnear-by objects, and the telephotographic camera, which gives a large\r\nimage of remote objects, such as an enemy’s fort, and the panorama\r\ncamera, which is designed to cover a broad field. For this purpose the\r\nlens is movably mounted for a semi-circular swing, and the image is\r\nflashed across a curved film in the case. The Eastman Panoram-Kodak,\r\nseen in Fig. 207, is an external illustration of this type, and in Fig.\r\n207A is shown a sectional view of another make of panorama camera which\r\nclearly shows the internal construction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 207A.--SECTIONAL PLAN OF PANORAMIC CAMERA.]\r\n\r\nAs allied branches of the photographic art, photo-engraving,\r\nphoto-lithographing, and half-tone engraving are important developments\r\nof the Nineteenth Century.\r\n\r\nPhoto-engraving is a process by means of which photographs may be used\r\nin forming plates from which prints in ink can be taken. The process\r\ndepends upon the property possessed by bichromate of potassium, and\r\nother chemicals, of rendering insoluble under the action of light,\r\ngelatine or some similar substance. A picture is thus produced on a\r\nmetal plate, and the blank spaces are etched out by acid, leaving the\r\nlines in relief as printing surfaces. When the operation is reversed,\r\nand only the _darks_ are etched in _intaglio_, to be filled with ink, as\r\nin copper-plate engraving, it is called photo-gravure. Mungo Ponton, in\r\n1839, discovered the sensitive quality of a sheet of paper treated with\r\nbichromate of potash. In 1840 Becquerel discovered that the sizing had\r\nan important function, and Fox Talbot, in 1853, discovered and utilized\r\nthe insolubility of gelatine exposed to light in presence of bichromate\r\nof potash. In 1854 Paul Pretsch observed that the exposed parts of the\r\ngelatine did not swell in water. One of the first suggestions of\r\nphoto-engraving appears in the British patent No. 13,736, of 1851, of\r\nJames Palmer. In recent times great perfection in details has been\r\nobtained by Mr. Moss, of the Photo-Engraving Company, and others. The\r\nAlbert-type and Woodbury-type are early modifications of this art.\r\n\r\nIn _photo-lithography_ the photograph is transferred to the stone, and\r\nthe latter then used to print from, as in lithography. The operation\r\nconsists: 1, in making the photographic negative; 2, printing with it\r\nupon transfer paper coated with gelatine and bichromate of potash: 3,\r\nthe transfer paper is then given a coat of insoluble fatty transfer ink\r\nfrom an inking stone; 4, all ink on surfaces not reached by the light\r\nbeing on a soluble surface is washed off, leaving the insoluble lines\r\nacted upon by light forming the picture; 5, the washed transfer sheet is\r\nthen applied to the stone, and the remaining inked lines of the design\r\nare transferred to the stone; 6, the stone with transferred lines will\r\nnow receive ink from the ink rolls on these lines, and repels ink from\r\nall other surfaces, which latter are made repellent by being kept\r\nconstantly wet, as in ordinary lithography. The first attempts in this\r\nart were by Dixon, of Jersey City, and Lewis, of Dublin, in 1841, who\r\nused resins. Joseph Dixon, in 1854, was the first to use organic matter\r\nand bichromate of potash upon stone to produce a photo-lithograph. In\r\n1859 J. W. Osborne patented in Australia, and in 1861 in the United\r\nStates, a transfer process which gave such great impetus to the art that\r\nhe may be considered its founder and chief promotor. His United States\r\npatents are No. 32,668, June 25, 1861, and No. 33,172, August 27, 1861.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 208.--PHOTOGRAPH GALLERY.]\r\n\r\nFor photo-lithography only line drawing, type print, or script, without\r\nany smooth shading, can be employed. The most extensive application of\r\nphoto-lithography is in the reproduction of the Patent Office drawings,\r\nwhich amount to about 60,000 sheets weekly. The contracting firm, which\r\nis probably the largest in the world, also prints each week by\r\nphoto-lithography 7,000 copies of the _Patent Office Gazette_, of about\r\n165 pages each, including both drawings and claims, and also reproduces\r\nspecifications without errors or proof reading, thus saving about 200\r\nper cent. in cost over type setting. This art is also largely employed\r\nfor printing maps, and the reproduction of the pages of books by this\r\nprocess has flooded the stores and news stands with cheap literature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 209.--DIAGRAM SHOWING PRODUCTION OF DOT.]\r\n\r\n_Half-tone engraving_ enables a photograph to be reproduced on a\r\nprinting press, and for faithfulness in reproduction and low cost has\r\nrevolutionized the art of illustrating, as nearly all books, magazines,\r\nand newspapers are now illustrated by this process. Before its\r\nintroduction it was not possible to reproduce cheaply in printers’ ink\r\nshaded pictures like photographs, brush drawings, paintings, etc.\r\nHalf-tone engraving renders it possible to thus print on a press, with\r\nprinters’ ink, reproductions of photographs or any shaded picture, in\r\nwhich the soft shadows fade away in depth to white by an imperceptible\r\ntenuity. It does so by breaking up the soft shadows into minute stipples\r\nwhich form inkable printing faces in relief, by the interposition of a\r\nfine reticulated screen between the camera lens and the sensitive plate.\r\nThis forms a sort of stencil negative through which the copper plate is\r\netched, which latter is thus converted into a relief plate whose raised\r\nsurfaces left by the etching may receive ink and print like an ordinary\r\nrelief plate. By making the screen lines very fine (80 to 250 meshes to\r\nthe inch), the visible effect of the shading is so far preserved that\r\nthe photograph may be reproduced in printers’ ink with but little\r\ndepreciation. At first, bolting cloth was used for the screen, but at\r\npresent two glass plates, with closely ruled lines, laid crosswise upon\r\neach other, form the screen. A characteristic distinction of half-tone\r\nwork is the regularly stippled surface, formed by the stenciling out of\r\na portion of the picture by the screen, which may be easily seen with\r\nany magnifying glass. It is called half-tone process because half of the\r\ntones or shadows are preserved, the other half being stenciled out. The\r\nuse of gauze screens was first described by Fox Talbot in British patent\r\nNo. 565, October 29, 1852.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 210.--TRIMMING FILM.]\r\n\r\nIn the making of a half-tone negative, the photograph, painting, or wash\r\ndrawing which is to be reproduced, is set up in front of the camera,\r\nwhich is arranged on an inclined runway, as seen in Fig. 208, and an\r\nexposure is made on a plate prepared by the wet collodion process (see\r\npage 304). The shadows of the picture are broken up into stipples or\r\ndots by the interposition of a cross-lined screen arranged in the plate\r\nholder between the lens and the sensitive plate, so that the picture\r\ntaken is “half-toned” or stippled. Fig. 209 illustrates the relation of\r\nthe parts, in which the picture to be copied is seen on the right, the\r\ncamera lens in the middle, and the cross-lined screen on the left in\r\nfront of the sensitive plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 211.--STRIPPING FILM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 212.--PRINTING BY ELECTRIC LIGHT.]\r\n\r\nThe image on the plate is then developed and fixed, and in order to\r\nsecure a printed image exactly like the copy as to right and left\r\nposition it is necessary to reverse the negative. This is done by\r\ncutting the film square, as seen in Fig. 210, and then peeling it off\r\nthe glass, as seen at Fig. 211, and transferring it to another glass\r\nplate in reversed relation. The copper printing plate is produced as\r\nfollows: The plate is first polished, as seen at the top of Fig. 213,\r\nand is then sensitized with a solution of organic matter and an alkaline\r\nbichromate. The face of the reversed negative is laid flat against and\r\nin direct contact with the face of the sensitized copper plate, and\r\ntightly held thereto by the screw clamps of the half tone printing\r\nframe. The printing on the sensitized copper face through the stippled\r\nor half-tone negative is then effected either by daylight or by the\r\nelectric light. The application of the electric light for this purpose\r\nis shown in Fig. 212. The copper plate is then taken out and subjected\r\nto the three lower operations seen in Fig. 213. It is first developed\r\nunder a stream of water from a faucet, seen on the left, and is then\r\ntaken in a pair of pliers and held over a gas stove, as seen at the\r\nbottom, to “burn-in” the image, and then placed in a tray containing an\r\netching bath of chloride of iron seen on the right, by which the copper\r\nis eaten away around the little stipples, and the latter, representing\r\nthe half tones of the original picture, are left raised, or in relief,\r\nto form the inkable surfaces of the printing plate. So fine are these\r\nstipples, however, that the picture is to the eye perfectly reproduced.\r\nThe several views illustrating this process are made in this way, the\r\nlines of the reticulated screen being 175 to the inch. The plate is next\r\nsubjected to the mechanical operation of “routing out” or cutting away\r\nthe undesirable portions by a routing machine, seen in Fig. 214. It then\r\nreceives further mechanical treatment to correct imperfections and\r\nfinish its edges, and is finally mounted upon a block ready for the\r\nprinter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 213.--TREATMENT OF COPPER PLATE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 214.--ROUTER AT WORK ON HALF-TONE PLATE.]\r\n\r\nThe most striking application made of photography in recent years is in\r\nthe production of so-called moving pictures, in which a series of\r\nphotographic figures thrown upon the screen have all the motion of\r\nanimated scenes which have been caught and imprisoned by the swiftly\r\nacting and never failing memory of the camera, to be again turned loose\r\nin active play through the Kinetoscope or Biograph. Perhaps the most\r\nvaluable contribution to science at the end of the century made by this\r\nart is in surgery, for photographing through opaque bodies by the aid of\r\nthe Roentgen rays, but for the latter subjects treatment in separate\r\nchapters must be reserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE ROENTGEN OR X-RAYS.\r\n\r\n    GEISSLER TUBES--VACUUM TUBES OF CROOKES, HITTORF AND LENARD--THE\r\n    CATHODE RAY--ROENTGEN’S GREAT DISCOVERY IN 1895--X-RAY APPARATUS--\r\n    SALVIONI’S CRYPTOSCOPE--EDISON’S FLUOROSCOPE--THE FLUOROMETER--SUN\r\n    BURN FROM X-RAYS--USES OF X-RAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority of people have been accustomed to regard light as something\r\nto be excluded and controlled by opaque screens just as effectively as\r\nrain is excluded by a tin roof, or cold is kept out by a brick wall. The\r\nshady retreat furnished relief from the garish day to the primitive man,\r\nand the opaque shades and Venetian blinds of modern civilization exclude\r\nthe excess of light at our windows. Sunshine and shadow have, in fact,\r\nbeen correlated conditions to the ordinary observation of man since time\r\nbegan. The last few years of the Nineteenth Century, however, were to\r\nwitness the discovery of a new kind of light ray which, in its behavior,\r\nsubverted all previous conception of the nature and action of light. It\r\nwas a species of electric light, which we are accustomed to regard as\r\nbrilliant, but this light ray was invisible to the eye. It could not be\r\nrefracted or bent from its course by a prism or lens, and it was so\r\nsubtle, penetrating and insidious, that it could not be barred out like\r\nsunlight, but passed readily through many opaque substances, such as\r\nwood, flesh tissue, paper (even a book of 1,000 pages), as well as some\r\nof the metals. The lighter the weight of the substance, or less its\r\ndensity, the easier these rays passed through it, or the more\r\ntransparent such bodies were to the rays. The heavier metals, like\r\nplatinum, gold and lead, were practically opaque, or allowed none of the\r\nrays to pass through them, while the very light metal aluminum was about\r\nas transparent to these rays as was glass to ordinary light, and for\r\nthat reason this metal could form window panes for such rays, while\r\nexcluding other light. Most organic substances are transparent or\r\nsemi-transparent to these rays, and hence such rays readily pass through\r\nthe body of an individual, being only intercepted in part by the denser\r\nparts of the anatomy, such as the bones, so that a man in such light no\r\nlonger casts a well-defined shadow of his outline, but the shadow\r\ndisclosed is that of a skeleton, by virtue of the greater density of the\r\nbones. Any object of higher density, such as a ring upon the finger,\r\nclearly establishes its shadow by virtue of its greater density.\r\nLikewise, any foreign object in the body, such as a bullet from a\r\ngun-shot wound, or a foreign body accidentally swallowed, is perfectly\r\ndisclosed and located by the shadow which it casts. As these light rays\r\nhave been characterized as invisible, it may be difficult to understand\r\nhow invisible rays can cast a visible shadow, and it should be here\r\nstated that when these unseen rays fall upon certain chemical substances\r\nthe latter are made to glow with a peculiar fluorescence, and a screen\r\nmade of such fluorescing materials will light up where the rays fall\r\nupon it, and remain dark at the points where the rays are intercepted by\r\na substance opaque to such rays, thus outlining a shadow.\r\n\r\nNot only do these light rays in passing through the body tissues\r\n(transparent to them) cast a shadow of the bones or any foreign objects,\r\nbut by the application of photography to these shadow pictures a species\r\nof photograph, called a radiograph, or skiagraph, may be taken, and thus\r\nany foreign body, such as a bullet, may be definitely located in the\r\nhuman body and quickly extracted, without the element of doubt which\r\nbeset the old method of diagnosis, which, at best, was only intelligent\r\nguessing. Not only are foreign bodies so located, but the fractures of\r\nthe bones may also be accurately observed, studied and adjusted. Stone\r\nin the bladder may be discovered, and the condition and movements of the\r\nheart and lungs ascertained.\r\n\r\nThis new kind of light ray was discovered November 8, 1895, by Prof. W.\r\nC. Roentgen, of the Royal University of Wurzburg, and was named by him\r\nthe “X-Ray,” probably because the letter x in algebraic formula\r\nrepresents the unknown quantity, and the hitherto unknown and elusive\r\nquality of this light suggested to Prof. Roentgen this appropriate name.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, a peculiar quality of the X-Rays is that they are not\r\nvisible to the eye. A beam of X-Rays, thrown into a dark chamber through\r\nan aluminum window, would produce no illumination whatever in the room,\r\nbut such rays would still penetrate the room, and if a fluorescing\r\nscreen were placed in their path it would instantly light up. It is not\r\nsurprising, therefore, that these subtle rays should have so long eluded\r\nthe observation of the scientist.\r\n\r\nA brief sketch of the conditions leading up to the discovery of the rays\r\nis necessary to a proper understanding of the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 215.--THE CATHODE RAY.]\r\n\r\nEvery student of physics remembers the old-time lecture room\r\nexperiments in which the Geissler tubes, with their beautiful play of\r\ncolored lights, illustrated the action of the electrical discharge from\r\nthe glass plate machine or the Ruhmkorff coil, on rarified gaseous\r\nmedia. Electrical experiments in high vacua by Sir William Crookes, and\r\nby Hittorf and Lenard, have greatly added to the present knowledge in\r\nthis field, and paved the way to the discovery of Prof. Roentgen. It was\r\nknown that a vacuum tube, variously called after the names of these\r\nscientists, as a Crookes, Hittorf, or Lenard tube, having platinum\r\nelectrodes sealed in its ends, would, under the static discharge of\r\nelectricity through it, give peculiar manifestations of light. One of\r\nthe conducting terminals of such tubes was called, in electrical\r\nparlance, the “anode,” from the Greek ανα (up) ὁδος (way), meaning the\r\nway up or into the tube, and referring to the entering path of an\r\nelectric current, or its positive pole; while the other was called the\r\n“cathode,” from κατα (down), ὁδος (way), meaning the way down or out,\r\nand referring to the outgoing path of an electric current, or its\r\nnegative pole. When such glass tube, partially exhausted of air,\r\nreceived through its anode and cathode terminals a discharge of static\r\nelectricity, a peculiar manifestation of light is seen between the anode\r\nand cathode terminals. At the anode it appears as a peach blossom glow,\r\nand at the cathode it appears as a bluish green light. If the exhaustion\r\nof the air in the tube is carried very high, approaching a perfect\r\nvacuum, or to about one millionth of the atmospheric pressure, the glow\r\nlight at the anode disappears, and that at the cathode increases until\r\nit fills the entire tube with its characteristic light. This is called\r\nthe “cathode ray,” or “cathodic ray,” an illustration of which is given\r\nin Fig. 215, where the cathode ray is seen in a Crookes tube emanating\r\nfrom the negative pole N or cathode _a_, and casting a shadow of the\r\nMaltese cross _b_ into the end of the tube, as seen at _d_. Many of the\r\ncharacteristics of the cathode ray had been observed prior to Prof.\r\nRoentgen’s discovery, which, briefly stated, grew out of the following\r\nobservation: He noticed that when a vacuum tube illumined by the cathode\r\nray was completely masked or covered up by an external shield of black\r\npaper, so that no illumination of the tube was visible to the eye, there\r\nstill passed through it certain subtle rays of light, invisible to the\r\neye, but which would instantly illuminate a sheet of paper coated on one\r\nside with barium platino-cyanide, even at a distance of two yards or\r\nmore, and that these invisible light rays were capable of passing\r\nthrough many substances opaque to ordinary light. He also discovered\r\nthat these rays could be made to take a shadow photograph on a sensitive\r\nplate without even exposing the plate in the usual way, the X-Rays\r\npassing freely through the opaque ebonite or pasteboard screen of the\r\nplate holder. It did not take the scientific world long to realize the\r\nimmense importance of this discovery, and to-day X-Ray apparatus\r\nconstitutes the greatest addition to the surgeon’s resources that has\r\never been made in the form of mechanical appliances, since by its aid\r\nany foreign body in the human frame of greater density than the flesh\r\nmay be at once definitely located and extracted, or any fracture of the\r\nbone disclosed, as the case may be. In the illustration, Fig. 216, is\r\nshown an X-Ray photograph of the hand of a gentleman whose thumb bone\r\nhas been destroyed by disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 216.--X-RAY PHOTO OF HAND, SHOWING DISEASED THUMB\r\nBONE.]\r\n\r\nSoon after the announcement of Prof. Roentgen’s discovery, apparatus was\r\ndevised for seeing with the naked eye the image formed by the shadow of\r\nthe X-Rays. Prof. Salvioni constructed such a device and described it\r\nbefore the Rome Medical Society as early as February 8, 1896. He called\r\nit the “cryptoscope.” It was quite a simple affair, and consisted of an\r\nobservation tube with a lens, having in front of it a screen of\r\nfluorescing material, such as platino-cyanide of barium. When the object\r\nto be examined, the hand, for instance, was held in front of the\r\nfluorescing screen, and the X-Rays from the vacuum tube fell upon the\r\nhand, located between the vacuum tube and the fluorescing screen, a\r\nshadow of the bones was cast on the fluorescing screen by virtue of the\r\ngreater density of the bones, which shadow was clearly discernible to\r\nthe eye at the end of the observation tube. By this device one was able\r\nto see his own bones through the flesh. A device, invented by Edison and\r\ncalled the “fluoroscope,” was constructed on substantially the same\r\nprinciple. This used a tapered observation tube like the old-fashioned\r\nstereoscope box, which had at its outer wide end the fluorescing screen,\r\nand its small end fashioned to fit the forehead and strapped thereto so\r\nas to enclose both eyes. This device is shown in Fig. 217, in which an\r\nX-Ray vacuum tube is housed in a wooden box, on which the hand of the\r\npatient, or other part to be viewed, is laid, the X-Rays passing readily\r\nthrough the top of the box and casting a shadow of the bones of the\r\nhand, or foreign body, on the fluorescing screen of the observation\r\ntube. Edison’s experiments also led him in constructing his fluorescing\r\nscreen, after testing a great number of substances, to select the\r\nchemical known as calcium tungstate, instead of the barium\r\nplatino-cyanide, since the calcium tungstate appeared to give better\r\nresults in fluorescing. Many other chemicals can be used, however, for\r\nmaking the fluorescing screen, such as the sulphides of calcium, barium\r\nand strontium. A recently discovered and powerful fluorescing substance\r\nis the double fluoride of ammonium and uranium, discovered by Dr.\r\nMecklebeke. Such fluorescing materials are spread in a thin layer on the\r\nside of the screen next to the observer in the viewing apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 217.--EDISON’S SURGEON’S X-RAY APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nIt is not to be understood that such viewing apparatus is necessary in\r\ntaking a surgical photograph. In such case only the X-Ray tube, means\r\nfor exciting it, the patient’s body, and the sensitive photographic\r\nplate, are essential factors, the patient’s limb or body being\r\ninterposed between the light tube and photographic plate, so as to cause\r\nthe X-Rays emanating from the tube to cast the shadow of the patient’s\r\nbones, the bullet in his body, or other foreign object, directly upon\r\nthe photographic plate, the sensitive and conscious plate obeying the\r\nwill of these subtle rays, and receiving the impress of their actinic\r\neffect under conditions which it denies to ordinary light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 218.--COMPLETE X-RAY APPARATUS IN USE.]\r\n\r\nFor exciting the vacuum tube any electrical machine capable of throwing\r\na series of sparks across a gap of about five inches is sufficient.\r\nVarious electrical machines may be used for this purpose, the Holtz, or\r\nthe Wimshurst glass plate machine, the Ruhmkorff, or induction coil, or\r\neven the high frequency transformer. A good example of a complete X-Ray\r\napparatus is that in use at the Army Medical Museum at Washington, made\r\nby Otis Clapp & Son, and shown in Fig. 218. The electrical generator is\r\nof the Wimshurst type, and is shown in a large glass-enclosed cabinet on\r\nthe right. The glass disks within are rotated either by a small electric\r\nmotor shown on the floor, or by a hand crank above. The X-Ray tube, of\r\nglobular or bulb shape, is shown just above the patient’s hip, and its\r\nopposite poles are connected by wires to the opposite electrodes of the\r\ngenerator. When the current is switched on by the operator, the bulb is\r\nilluminated with the cathode rays, and the X-Rays, proceeding therefrom\r\nthrough the clothing and flesh of the patient, cast a shadow of the\r\npatient’s hip joint upon the photographic plate placed on the cot\r\nbeneath the patient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 219.--X-RAY FOCUS TUBE.]\r\n\r\nIn the effort to secure greater sharpness in the image cast by the\r\nX-Rays, various forms of vacuum tubes have been devised. That shown in\r\nFig. 219 represents one of the most important improvements. K is the\r\ncathode plate, formed of a concave disk of aluminum, which focuses the\r\nrays at a point near the center of the bulb. At this point a plate of\r\nplatinum A, which metal allows practically none of the X-Rays to pass\r\nthrough it, is mounted on the anode in such an angular position that it\r\ngathers the focused rays and reflects them through the side of the tube.\r\nThey thus make a sharper shadow than when radiating from the more\r\nextended surface of the glass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 220.--LOCATING A FOREIGN BODY IN THE BRAIN.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 220 is shown an X-Ray tube, as applied for locating a foreign\r\nbody in the brain cavity, in which view the patient’s head is interposed\r\nbetween the X-Ray tube and the fluorescing screen, or photographic\r\nplate, as the case may be; while Fig. 221 shows the application of the\r\nsame devices to the body. In both these views the particular form of\r\nX-Ray apparatus is known as the “Fluorometer,” made under the Dennis\r\nPatent, No. 581,540, April 27, 1897, and it is devised with reference to\r\nmore accurately locating the foreign object by its shadow, for which\r\npurpose adjustable bracket-sights, seen in Fig. 221 on opposite sides of\r\nthe body, are provided for bringing the X-Rays into proper alignment for\r\nprojecting the shadow of the foreign body in true indicative position on\r\nthe fluorescing screen, while a cross hatched grating behind the body,\r\ngraduated in aliquot spaces of an inch, furnishes a measured field, and\r\nforms an easy and quick means of platting the position of said object.\r\nIn the position of parts in the two figures the horizontal line, on\r\nwhich the foreign object lies, would be determined, but it would not\r\nindicate how deep in the object was, _i. e._, whether it was in the\r\nmiddle, or on one side. To determine this the fluorescing screen and\r\ngrating are placed under the patient, and the X-Ray tube above, and the\r\nvertical line of the object is thus obtained. Both the vertical line and\r\nhorizontal line having been obtained, it will be obvious that the\r\nforeign object will lie at the intersection of these two lines, which\r\nestablishes for the surgeon its definite location.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 221.--X-RAY APPARATUS APPLIED TO THE BODY.]\r\n\r\nIt has been observed by Prof. Elihu Thomson, and also by Dr. Kolle, that\r\nthe X-Rays are not absorbed and destroyed by the sensitive chemicals of\r\na single photographic plate, but so potent and penetrating is their\r\ninfluence that the rays pass through and produce an image on a number of\r\nplates, placed one behind the other, thus affording means for\r\nmultiplying the image at one exposure.\r\n\r\nAmong other uses of the X-Ray may be mentioned its capacity to detect\r\nspurious from genuine gems, the diamond giving a distinct color from its\r\nimitations, as do also most other precious stones.\r\n\r\nA peculiar physiological effect of the X-Rays is their capacity to\r\nproduce a severe effect on the skin, somewhat resembling sunburn. Such\r\nresult, produced by long and continued exposure, has sometimes so\r\nderanged the skin tissues as to make sores that resulted in the entire\r\nloss of and renewal of the skin.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the X-Ray by Prof. Roentgen may be fairly considered\r\none of the most wonderful scientific achievements of the century, and\r\nhis first memoir in 1895 is so full, clear and exact, as to have left\r\nvery little more to be said about it. It is to-day, as it was found by\r\nhim in 1895, the same mysterious, unseen, but positive force, a species\r\nof electrical energy without a domicile, and needing no conductor, a\r\nform of light passing through closed doors, invisible itself, and yet\r\nlighting up certain substances with a halo of glory, and radically\r\nchanging and decomposing others. Rivaling the sun in actinic power, and\r\nwriting its autograph with an unseen hand, it is truly called the X-, or\r\nunknown, ray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nGAS LIGHTING.\r\n\r\n    EARLY USE OF NATURAL GAS--COAL GAS INTRODUCED BY MURDOCH--WINSOR\r\n    ORGANIZES FIRST GAS COMPANY IN 1804--MELVILLE IN UNITED STATES\r\n    LIGHTS BEAVER-TAIL LIGHTHOUSE WITH GAS IN 1817--LOWE’S PROCESS OF\r\n    MAKING WATER GAS--ACETYLENE GAS--CARBURETTED AIR--PINTSCH GAS--GAS\r\n    METER--OTTO GAS ENGINE--THE WELSBACH BURNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many centuries the going down of the sun marked a cessation of man’s\r\nlabors, and among his first efforts toward increasing his efficiency was\r\nthe prolongation of his hours of vision by artificial illumination.\r\nBeginning with a shell for a lamp, a rush for a wick, and the fat of his\r\ngame for oil, the first crude lamp was made, and while it shed but a\r\nfeeble and flickering light, man ceased to go to sleep with the fowls\r\nand the beasts, and continued his labors and amusements into the night.\r\nFor many centuries the lamp held its exclusive sway, and probably will\r\never find a useful place; but with the discovery of coal gas and its\r\npractical manufacture the nights of the Nineteenth Century have been\r\nmade to represent illuminated illustrations of the world’s progress.\r\nCoal gas can hardly be claimed as an invention, however, for natural gas\r\nfrom the bowels of the earth had been observed and used in China from\r\ntime immemorial. The holy fires of Baku on the shores of the Caspian and\r\nelsewhere were also thus supplied. The first steps toward its artificial\r\nproduction began in the latter part of the Seventeenth Century with Dr.\r\nClayton. Bishop Watson, in 1750, and Lord Dundonald, in 1786, also\r\nexperimented with combustible gas made from coal, but the man who more\r\nthan any other contributed to its practical manufacture and introduction\r\nwas Mr. Murdoch, of Redruth, Cornwall, England. In 1792 Murdoch erected\r\na gas distilling apparatus, and lighted his house and offices by gas\r\ndistributed through service pipes. In 1798 he so lighted the steam\r\nengine works of Boulton & Watt, at Soho, near Birmingham; and in 1802\r\nmade public illumination of the works by this means on the occasion of a\r\npublic celebration. In 1801 Le Bon, of Paris, used a gas made from wood\r\nfor lighting his house. In 1803-4 Frederick Albert Winsor lighted the\r\nLyceum Theatre, took out a British patent No. 2,764, of 1804, for\r\nlighting streets by gas, and established the National Light and Heat\r\nCompany, which was the first gas company. In 1804-5 Murdoch lighted the\r\ncotton factory of Phillips & Lee at Manchester, the light being\r\nestimated as equal to 3,000 candles, and this was the largest\r\nundertaking up to that date. In 1807 Winsor lighted one side of Pall\r\nMall, London, and this was the first street lighting. A disastrous\r\nexplosion occurred shortly afterwards, and such eminent men as Sir\r\nHumphrey Davy, Wollaston, and Watt expressed the opinion that it could\r\nnot be safely used; but the so-called “coal smoke” had come to stay, and\r\nin 1813 Westminster Bridge and the Houses of Parliament were lighted\r\nwith gas. In 1815 there was general adoption of gas in the streets of\r\nLondon, and shortly afterwards in Paris. In 1805-6 David Melville, of\r\nNewport, R. I., invented a gas apparatus and lighted his house with it.\r\nHe took out United States patent March 18, 1813, and in 1817 contracted\r\nwith the United States to supply for a year the Beaver Tail Lighthouse.\r\nIn 1815 James McMurtrie proposed the lighting of the streets of\r\nPhiladelphia; Baltimore commenced the use of gas in 1816, Boston in\r\n1822, and New York in 1825.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 222.--A COAL GAS PLANT.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 222 is shown a diagrammatic illustration of the principal\r\nfeatures of a gas works, as employed throughout the greater part of the\r\nNineteenth Century. On the left is seen the furnace, in which is\r\narranged above the fire a series of retorts, which are in the nature of\r\nhorizontal closed cast iron boxes. Only one of the series is visible in\r\nthe view. Their ends project out beyond the furnace walls, and have\r\ndoors for giving access to the interior, and each retort outside the\r\nfurnace is connected by an upright pipe to an elevated cylinder called a\r\n_hydraulic main_. When the retort is charged with coal through its end\r\ndoor, and is heated red hot by the subjacent fire of the furnace, a\r\nheavy gas is driven off from the coal, which passes up the pipe to the\r\n_hydraulic main_, where it partially condenses and leaves its heavier\r\nportions in the form of coal tar and ammoniacal liquor. The gas then\r\npasses through the series of bent pipes, which form a _condenser_, where\r\nother remaining portions of the tar and other impurities are condensed,\r\nand drawn off from time to time in the little well shown on the left of\r\nthe coil. From the condenser coils the gas passes into the _purifier_,\r\nshown on the right of the coils as an enclosed case having a series of\r\nshelves on which is spread slaked lime, which takes up from the gas\r\nimpurities in the form of sulphuretted hydrogen and carbonic acid. From\r\nthis _purifier_ the gas passes downwardly through a pipe into a large\r\ngas holder whose lower end is sealed in a water tank, and which gas\r\nholder is balanced by weights and chains passing over pulleys. With the\r\ngas holder, the distributing mains of the city are made to connect to\r\nreceive their supply. When the gas holder is full it is buoyed up by the\r\nlighter gas, and occupies an elevated position, and as its supply is\r\nused up, the gas holder settles down into the water.\r\n\r\nIn the operation of gas making many valuable secondary products are\r\nformed. The coal in the retorts is not entirely consumed, but is reduced\r\nto the condition of coke, and in this form is sold for fuel. The\r\nammoniacal condensations are purified to form ammonia, while the coal\r\ntar, which but a few years ago was little more than a waste material, is\r\nnow a valuable commercial product, being extensively used in the\r\nmanufacture of the aniline, phenol, and naphthalene dyes, also in\r\nmedicines and perfumes, and being used in crude form also as an\r\nimportant element in street paving compositions.\r\n\r\n_Water Gas._--In 1875 an important era in gas making was inaugurated by\r\nthe introduction of what is known as “_water gas_,” so called for the\r\nreason that water in the form of steam is decomposed and its hydrogen,\r\nmixed with carbonic oxide gas, is mingled with a heavier carbon gas from\r\noil, and is converted at a high temperature into a permanent, stable\r\nilluminating gas, at a much lower cost than coal gas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 223.--LOWE’S WATER GAS APPARATUS, PATENTED SEPTEMBER\r\n21, 1875.]\r\n\r\nFontana was the first to notice the decomposition of steam by\r\nincandescent carbon to form hydrogen and carbonic oxide. Ibbetson’s\r\nBritish patent, No. 4,954, of 1824, represents the first application of\r\nthis principle. This was followed by Alexander Selligue, who, in 1834,\r\nobtained a French patent, No. 9,800, and in 1842 produced water gas at\r\nBatignolles, a suburb of Paris. Sanders’ United States patent, 21,027,\r\nJuly 27, 1858, was the basis of an experiment tried at the Girard House\r\nin Philadelphia. These, with Siemens’ British patents, Nos. 2,861, of\r\n1856, and 972, of 1863, for methods of constructing furnaces, constitute\r\nthe earlier steps in the development of water gas, although many other\r\npatents were granted prior to the latter date for various methods and\r\nforms of apparatus. The practical production and successful commercial\r\nuse of water gas, however, began with T. S. C. Lowe, who obtained United\r\nStates patent No. 167,847, September 21, 1875, and revolutionized the\r\ngas making industry. In less than a dozen years from the date of his\r\npatent 150 cities and towns in the United States were using water gas,\r\nand in 1886 the Franklin Institute gave to Mr. Lowe a grand medal of\r\nhonor for his invention, which of those exhibited that year was believed\r\nto contribute most to the welfare of mankind by cheapening the cost of\r\nlight. Fig. 223 represents an illustration of the Lowe apparatus as\r\nshown in his patent, and whose operation is as follows: Valves 9 and 10\r\nbeing open, an anthracite coal fire in generator chamber 1 gives off\r\ncarbonic oxide gas, which passes down pipe 2 and enters the base of\r\nsuperheater 3, where mixing with air coming down pipe 4, it burns to\r\nform an intense heat. The chamber, 3, is filled with loose pieces of\r\nfire brick, which are soon heated white hot. Valves 9 and 10 are then\r\nclosed and steam is taken from an upright boiler, 6, and carried by a\r\nsmall pipe, 7, to the incandescent mass in chamber 3, and passing down\r\nthrough it is superheated. This superheated steam passes from the bottom\r\nof chamber 3 to the bottom of chamber 1, and then up through the mass of\r\nred hot coal. The intensely hot steam is thus decomposed into hydrogen\r\nand oxygen, and the oxygen unites with the carbon of the coal to form\r\ncarbonic oxide gas. As hydrogen and carbonic oxide burn with only a\r\nfeeble blue flame, these gases are now made richer in light giving\r\ncarbon at this point by the addition of oil contained in an elevated\r\ntank, 8. This, dripping on the incandescent coal in chamber 1, is\r\nvolatilized, and at the same time enriches and combines with the\r\nhydrogen and carbonic oxide to form a permanent illuminating gas (water\r\ngas) that passes up pipe 5 and through the flues in boiler 6, to outlet\r\n13, and thence on in the usual way to the condenser, scrubber and gas\r\nholder, which are not shown, and merely act to purify the gas. As the\r\nexcessively hot water gas passes through the boiler flues it furnishes\r\nthe necessary heat to generate the steam. The air used in the process is\r\nforced at 12 into a drum in the smokestack, 11, and is heated by the\r\nescaping products of combustion. In practical operation there are two\r\n(or more) of the steam superheating chambers 3, working alternately, and\r\none of them is being heated up while the other is superheating the\r\nsteam.\r\n\r\nWater gas has neither the illuminating nor the heating qualities of coal\r\ngas, and it is also much more poisonous. According to O. Wyss, one-tenth\r\nof 1 per cent. of uncarburetted water gas renders the air of a room\r\ninjurious to health, and 1 per cent. is fatal to all warm-blooded\r\nanimals. Notwithstanding these facts, however, its extreme cheapness and\r\nfairly satisfactory light have carried it into such general use that\r\nto-day it is said that two-thirds of all gas made in the United States\r\nis carburetted water gas.\r\n\r\n_Acetylene Gas_ is a combination of two parts carbon and two parts\r\nhydrogen. It was discovered in 1836 by Edmond Davy, who produced\r\ncarburet of potassium, and evolved acetylene gas therefrom by\r\ndecomposing it with water. It was long known as _klumene_, and when\r\nburned it produced an intense white light. For a long time it was only\r\nproduced in a small way in the laboratory. It is now made commercially\r\nby the mutual decomposition of water and calcium carbide, the latter\r\ngiving off, when brought in contact with the water, acetylene gas, which\r\nrises in bubbles. In the reaction the carbon of the carbide unites with\r\na portion of the hydrogen of the water, producing acetylene gas (C₂H₂),\r\nwhile the calcium of the carbide unites with the oxygen of the water and\r\nthe remaining portion of the hydrogen and forms calcium hydrate, or\r\nslaked lime, which precipitates as a slush.\r\n\r\nThe union of carbon with an alkali metal, first accomplished by Davy in\r\n1836, was followed in 1861 by the combination of carbon with calcium by\r\nWohler. It was not, however, until the electrical furnace became an\r\nagency in chemical reaction that calcium carbide was made on a\r\ncommercial scale. The production of acetylene gas for illuminating\r\npurposes began with the operations of Thomas L. Willson in 1893, and his\r\npatents, Nos. 541,137 and 541,138, of June 18, 1895, and 563,527 and\r\n563,528 of July 7, 1896, cover the chemical process, the product, and\r\nthe mode of operating. The reaction is a very simple one. A mixture of\r\nlime and carbon is subjected to the heat of an electric arc, and the\r\ncarbon combines with the calcium of the lime to form calcium carbide,\r\nwhich appears on the market as dirty black stone-like lumps. The\r\nsimplicity of the method of generating acetylene gas from this substance\r\nby merely bringing it in contact with water has greatly stimulated\r\ninvention in this field. The art began practically in 1895, and since\r\nthat time more than 500 patents have been granted for acetylene gas\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 224.--ACETYLENE GAS APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nA very simple apparatus for the purpose is shown in Fig. 224, in which a\r\nvessel containing water has an inverted bell or cylinder within it, open\r\nat its lower end. A basket or cage is suspended within the inner\r\ncylinder, and contains a few lumps of calcium carbide, which are first\r\nimmersed in the water by being forced down by the rod supporting the\r\nsame, which passes through a stuffing box. Acetylene gas is immediately\r\ngenerated and its pressure forces the level of the water down in the\r\ninner cylinder, causing it to rise in the annular space between said\r\ncylinder and the case. As the water level descends in the inner chamber\r\nit passes out of contact with the calcium carbide, and the generation of\r\ngas is discontinued until some of the gas is drawn off or consumed at\r\nthe burners, whose pipe is shown connecting with the gas space of the\r\ninner cylinder. When so drawn off, the pressure in the inner cylinder is\r\nrelieved, and the water therein rises to contact again with the calcium\r\ncarbide and renews the generation of gas. This principle of automatic\r\naction is a very old one, and will be recognized by the student as that\r\nof the Dobereiner lamp of the chemical laboratory, invented by Prof.\r\nDobereiner, of Jena, in 1824.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 225.--MULTI-CHARGE ACETYLENE GAS GENERATOR.]\r\n\r\nIn acetylene gas apparatus a great variety of methods are employed for\r\nbringing the water and carbide into contact. Instead of the automatic\r\npressure level principle described, many devices discharge a regulated\r\nquantity of powdered calcium carbide into the water, while in another\r\nform the water is discharged upon the calcium carbide. An example of the\r\nlatter is given in Fig. 225, which represents the Criterion generator. A\r\nnumber of receptacles containing charges of calcium carbide are made to\r\nsuccessively receive a regulated quantity of water, the gas being\r\ncollected in a rising and falling holder.\r\n\r\nAcetylene gas finds its principal uses for isolated plants, and in\r\ncountry houses. One form of using it is to compress it under high\r\ntension in cylinders, but this method has been attended with some\r\ndisastrous explosions, and is discriminated against by the insurance\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\nCalcium carbide is now made in a large way by the Willson Aluminum\r\nCompany, at Spray, N. C., and also at Niagara Falls and at Sault St.\r\nMarie, Mich., and its cost is between 3 and 4 cents per pound.\r\n\r\nAcetylene gas has an acrid, garlicy odor, and burns with an intensely\r\nwhite flame, and so superior is it to coal gas in illuminating power\r\nthat it only requires a pipe of one-third the diameter of that used for\r\ncoal gas to produce the same illuminating effect.\r\n\r\n_Carburetted Air_ is another form of illuminating gas which has found\r\nsome useful applications. This consists simply of air forced through\r\nsome light hydrocarbon, such as naphtha, benzine or gasoline, and so\r\nsaturated with the vapors of these volatile substances as to become an\r\ninflammable mixture. Many patents have been granted for apparatus\r\noperating on this principle, and it has been put to some practical use\r\nin country houses, and seaside resorts.\r\n\r\n_Pintsch Gas_ is another special application. It is a gas made from oil\r\nand compressed in storage cylinders by means of pumps for portable use.\r\nIt is stored under a pressure sometimes as high as 150 pounds to the\r\ninch, its pressure being reduced at the burners through the agency of\r\npressure regulators. It is used for lighting railway cars, buoys, and\r\nlightships.\r\n\r\nGas making has probably been the most extensive and important of all the\r\ncommercial chemical operations of the Nineteenth Century, and with it\r\nhas come a great array of minor inventions as accessories. Among these\r\nfirst came the gas meter and pressure regulator. With the introduction\r\nof gas into houses some means of determining the amount consumed as a\r\nbasis of payment was required, and for this purpose the gas meter was\r\ndevised. The first gas meters were known as wet meters, and effected a\r\nmeasurement by passing the gas through a liquid and rotating a wheel\r\ntherein. The wet meter was invented by Clegg (British patent No. 3,968,\r\nof 1815), and the dry meter, by Malam (British patent No. 4,458, of\r\n1820), and improved by Defries (British patent. No. 7,705, of 1838). The\r\ngas regulator is simply a little automatic apparatus whereby the\r\nvariation of pressure in the gas main is reduced and the flow rendered\r\nperfectly uniform at the burner. It effects a saving of gas by\r\npreventing it from blowing when the pressure is too great, and also\r\ngives a more steady and uniform light.\r\n\r\nAmong the great number of mechanical devices which have grown out of the\r\nuse of gas may be mentioned the gas range for heat, the gas engine for\r\npower, and the Welsbach burner for light. The gas range has contributed\r\nmuch to the domestic economy of the city house. It gives an immediate\r\nheat in the kitchen for all culinary and domestic purposes, without the\r\nincidental objections of having to transport fuel and remove ashes. It\r\nis put into or out of action in an instant, saves labor and time, and\r\navoids the heat and discomfort of a coal stove during the hot months of\r\nsummer. It is organized in principle after the Bunsen burner, whereby a\r\nperfect combustion of the carbon is obtained with maximum heating effect\r\nand without smoke or deposits of lampblack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 226.--OTTO GAS ENGINE.]\r\n\r\nThe Otto gas engine, seen in Fig. 226, is a pioneer and representative\r\ntype of a great number of explosive gas engines, which in recent years\r\nhave become active competitors of the steam engine where only small\r\npower is required. The Otto engine is covered by patent No. 194,047,\r\nAugust 14, 1877. Patents No. 222,467, 297,329, 336,505, 358,796,\r\n320,285, 386,211 and 549,160 represent important developments in this\r\nart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 227.--WELSBACH GAS BURNER.]\r\n\r\n_The Welsbach burner_ for improving the quality of gaslight, and\r\neconomizing its consumption, is also well and favorably known. It\r\nutilizes the Bunsen burner principle to make a very perfect combustion\r\nof the gas, with the greatest possible heat and the least smoke, and\r\nthen directs its great heat on to a refractory body which will not burn,\r\nbut glows with a brilliant white incandescence. The Welsbach burner was\r\nbrought out in 1885. The United States patent therefor was granted\r\nOctober 7, 1890, to Carl Auer Von Welsbach, No. 438,125. The Welsbach\r\nlight is a development of the Drummond, or limelight, invented by Lieut.\r\nDrummond, of England, in 1826. This latter exposed a piece of quick lime\r\nto the intensely hot flame of the oxy-hydrogen blow pipe, which was\r\ninvented by Dr. Robt. Hare in 1802. The piece of lime glows with an\r\nintense brilliancy approximating that of the electric light. The\r\nWelsbach burner, see Fig. 227, operates on the same general principle,\r\nexcept that the refractory body, which is heated to incandescence, is a\r\ntubular sleeve of netted fabric first steeped in a solution of the salts\r\nof refractory earths, and then incinerated by heat to burn out the\r\ntextile fibre and leave the refractory earthy oxides as a skeleton of\r\nthe fabric, and which is called a “mantle.” This mantle is suspended\r\nabove the flame arising from a proper admixture of air and gas, and is\r\nheated thereby to a brilliant incandescence which furnishes the light.\r\nIn the Welsbach burner the light seen does not proceed directly from the\r\ncombustion of the gas, but from the white hot mantle. The light is a\r\nvery pure white one, does not distort or falsify colors, and effects a\r\ngreat saving of gas. An important improvement upon the mantle is covered\r\nby Rawson’s patent, July 30, 1889, No. 407,963, for coating the mantles\r\nwith paraffine or analogous material to toughen them and prevent them\r\nfrom breaking in packing and transportation.\r\n\r\n_Natural Gas._--No review of gas lighting would be complete without some\r\nreference to the development incident to the use of the natural gas\r\nflowing from the internal reservoirs of the earth. Such gas has been\r\nknown and utilized for centuries in China, and was conveyed by the\r\nChinese in bamboo pipes to points of utilization. The discovery of coal\r\noil in the United States in 1859, and the great advances made in the\r\nmethods and apparatus for sinking oil wells, have resulted in the\r\ndiscovery of numerous wells of natural gas, whose values were quickly\r\nperceived and utilized by their owners. The village of Fredonia, N. Y.,\r\nwas probably the first to be lighted by natural gas, and a flow from a\r\nwell at West Bloomfield, N. Y., opened in 1865, was carried in a wooden\r\nmain more than twenty miles to the city of Rochester. Many wells of\r\nnatural gas have since been found at various points, and so extensive\r\nhas been its use for cooking, heating, lighting and metallurgical\r\nprocesses, that thousands of patents have been taken for various forms\r\nof burners, pressure regulators and other appliances for utilizing the\r\nsame. The annual production of natural gas in the United States for 1888\r\nwas valued at $22,629,875. There has, however, been a steady decrease in\r\nthe past ten years. The amount produced in 1897 was $13,826,422. The\r\ninsatiable demands of modern civilization must some day exhaust the\r\nsupply, and what will take place when the subterranean chambers are\r\nrelieved of their burden is a question for the geologists to answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nCIVIL ENGINEERING.\r\n\r\n    GREAT BRIDGES--PNEUMATIC CAISSONS--TUNNELS--THE BEACH TUNNEL SHIELD\r\n    --SUEZ CANAL--DREDGES--THE LIDGERWOOD CABLEWAY--CANAL LOCKS--\r\n    ARTESIAN WELLS--COMPRESSED AIR ROCK DRILLS--BLASTING--MISSISSIPPI\r\n    JETTIES--IRON AND STEEL BUILDINGS--EIFFEL TOWER--WASHINGTON’S\r\n    MONUMENT--THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost entirely of an outdoor character, and necessarily on public\r\nexhibition, the engineering achievements of the Nineteenth Century have\r\nalways been conspicuously in evidence, challenging the admiration of the\r\npublic eye. They represent man’s attack upon the obstacles presented by\r\nnature to his irrepressible spirit of progress. Difficulties apparently\r\ninsuperable have confronted him, only to melt away under his persistent\r\ngenius until nothing seems impossible. He has connected continents with\r\nthe telegraph, has crosshatched the land with railroads, penetrated the\r\nbowels of the earth with artesian wells, opened communication between\r\noceans with the Suez Canal, reclaimed territory from the sea in Holland,\r\npierced mountain ranges with tunnels, drained marshes, irrigated\r\ndeserts, reared lofty structures of masonry and steel, spanned waters\r\nwith magnificent bridges, opened channel-ways to the sea, built beacons\r\nfor the mariner, and breakwaters for the storm beaten ship.\r\n\r\nProbably the most important branch of engineering work is railroad\r\nconstruction, already considered under steam railways. Closely related\r\nto the railroad, however, is bridge building, and many of these noble\r\nstructures hang between heaven and earth, conspicuous monuments of the\r\nengineer’s skill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 228.--THE FORTH BRIDGE. LARGEST VIADUCT IN THE\r\nWORLD. FROM A PHOTOGRAPH WHEN IN PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTION. LENGTH, 8,290\r\nFEET; HEIGHT ABOVE WATER, 361 FEET; MAIN SPANS, 1,710 FEET LONG, 150\r\nFEET HIGH.]\r\n\r\n_The Forth Bridge._--This massive structure, of the cantilever type, is\r\nshown in Fig. 228. It was begun in 1882 and finished in 1890, and is the\r\nlargest and most costly viaduct in the world. It is built across the\r\nFirth of Forth, and is the most important link in the direct railway\r\ncommunication of the North British Railway, and associated roads,\r\nbetween Edinburgh on the one side, and Perth and Dundee on the other.\r\nThe total length of the viaduct is 8,296 feet, or nearly 1⅝ miles. The\r\nextreme height of the structure is 361 feet above the water level, and\r\nthe foundations extend 91 feet below the water level. The two main spans\r\nare 1,710 feet, and these both give a clear headway for navigation of\r\n150 feet height. There are over 50,000 tons of steel in the\r\nsuperstructure, and about 140,000 cubic yards of masonry and concrete in\r\nthe foundation piers. The three main piers consist each of a group of\r\nfour masonry columns faced with granite, 49 feet in diameter at the top,\r\nand 36 feet high, which rest on solid rock, or on concrete carried down\r\nin most cases by means of caissons of a maximum diameter of 70 feet to\r\nrock or boulder clay.\r\n\r\nNo intelligent conception of the enormous size of this great structure\r\ncan be obtained except by comparison. Estimating from the bottom of the\r\nmasonry piers to the towering heights of the cantilevers, it reaches\r\nabove the dome of St. Peter’s at Rome, and is only a little short of the\r\nheight of the greatest of the pyramids of Egypt. The cost of the bridge\r\nis given as £3,250,000 or nearly $16,000,000.\r\n\r\n_The Brooklyn Bridge._--Having for its successful construction and\r\nmaintenance the same foundation principle upon which the spider builds\r\nits web, this magnificent bridge of steel wires spans the East River\r\nbetween New York and Brooklyn, with a total length of 5,989 feet, and in\r\nlength of span and cost is second only to the great Forth Bridge. It is\r\nshown in Fig. 229, and among suspension bridges it ranks first. It has a\r\ncentral span of 1,595½ feet between the two towers, over which the\r\nsuspension cables are hung, and has a clear headway beneath of 135 feet.\r\nIt has two side spans of 930 feet each between the towers and the shore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 229.--THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE. LONGEST SUSPENSION BRIDGE\r\nIN THE WORLD. TOTAL LENGTH, 5,989 FEET; SPAN BETWEEN TOWERS, 1,595 FEET\r\n6 INCHES.]\r\n\r\nThe suspension towers stand on two piers founded in the river on solid\r\nrock at depths of 78 and 45 feet below high water, and they rise 277\r\nfeet above the same level. There are four suspension cables 15½ inches\r\nin diameter, each composed of 5,282 galvanized steel wires, placed side\r\nby side, without any twist, and arranged in groups of 19 strands bound\r\nup with wire. These cables have a dip in the center of the large span of\r\n128 feet, rest on movable saddles on the top of the towers to allow for\r\nslight movement of the cables due to expansion and contraction, and are\r\nheld down at the shore ends by massive anchorages of masonry. The bridge\r\nhas a width of 85 feet, and has two roadways, two lines of railway, and\r\na foot way. It was begun in 1876 and opened for traffic in 1883, and its\r\ncost was about $15,000,000. It fulfills a great function for the busy\r\nmetropolis, and it hangs in the air a monument in steel wire to the\r\ngenius of the Roeblings.\r\n\r\n_Masonry Bridges._--The largest and finest single span of masonry in\r\nAmerica, and believed to be the largest in the world, is to be found\r\nabout 9 miles northwest of the city of Washington. It is known as the\r\nWashington Aqueduct or Cabin John Bridge, and is seen in Fig. 230. It\r\nextends across the small stream known as Cabin John Creek, and carries\r\nan aqueduct 9 feet in diameter, that supplies the National Capital with\r\nwater, its upper surface above the water conduit being formed into a\r\nfine roadway. It is 450 feet long. Its span is 220 feet, the height of\r\nthe roadway above the bed of the stream is 100 feet, and the width of\r\nthe structure is 20 feet 4 inches. Gen. Montgomery C. Meigs was the\r\nengineer in charge of its construction. It was begun in 1857 and\r\nfinished in 1864, with the exception of the parapet walls of the\r\nroadway, which were added in 1872-3. Its cost was $254,000. Only one\r\nother masonry arch has ever been built which equalled this in size. The\r\nTrezzo Bridge, built in the fourteenth century, over the Adda in North\r\nItaly, and subsequently destroyed, is said to have had a span of 251\r\nfeet, but the Washington Aqueduct Bridge at Cabin John is a noble work\r\nin masonry, and when standing beneath its majestic sweep, and viewing\r\nthe regular courses of masonry hanging nearly a hundred feet high in the\r\nair, and springing more than a hundred feet from the embankment upon\r\neither side, one loses sight of the principles of the arch, and the\r\nfear that the mass may fall upon him gives way to the impression that\r\nnature has bowed to the genius of man, and suspended the law of gravity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 230.--CABIN JOHN BRIDGE, NEAR WASHINGTON, D. C.\r\nLARGEST MASONRY ARCH IN THE WORLD. LENGTH, 450 FEET; SPAN OF ARCH, 220\r\nFEET; HEIGHT, 100 FEET.]\r\n\r\nAmong the patents granted for bridges the most important are those\r\nrelating to the cantilever type, among which may be mentioned those to\r\nBender, Latrobe, and Smith, No. 141,310, July 29, 1873; Eads, No.\r\n142,378 to 142,382, September 2, 1873, and Clarke, No. 504,559,\r\nSeptember 5, 1893.\r\n\r\n_Caissons._--For submarine explorations the ancient diving bell, which\r\nwas said to have been used more than 2,000 years ago, has given place to\r\ndiving armor, while for more extensive local work the pneumatic caisson\r\nis employed. The latter was invented by M. Triger, a French engineer, in\r\n1841. An early example of it is also given in Cochrane’s British patent\r\nNo. 3,226, of 1861. It consists of a vertical cylinder divided into\r\ncompartments, its lower open end resting on the river bottom. Compressed\r\nair forced into the lower compartment forces the water back, while the\r\nmen are at work, the intermediate chamber forming an air lock, by which\r\nentrance to, or egress from, the lower working chamber is obtained. The\r\npneumatic caissons of Eads (patents Nos. 123,002, January 23, 1872, and\r\n123,685, February 13, 1872) and Flad (patent No. 303,830, August 19,\r\n1884) are modern applications of the same principle. The sinking of\r\nshafts through quicksand, by artificially freezing the same and then\r\ntreating it as solid material, is an ingenious modern method shown in\r\npatents to Poetsch, No. 300,891, June 24, 1884; and Smith, No. 371,389,\r\nOctober 11, 1887.\r\n\r\n_Tunnels._--Less conspicuous than bridges, by virtue of their\r\nunderground character, but none the less important, are these mole-like\r\nmeans of communication. Especially difficult of construction for the\r\nreason that the nature of the soil or rock is largely unknown, and for\r\nthe reason also that the work may have to encounter faults in rocks, and\r\nsprings or quicksands in the earth; nevertheless the demands of the\r\nrailroads for shortening the distance of travel and economizing time\r\nhave stimulated the engineer to expend millions of dollars in piercing\r\nthe earth with these great underground passageways.\r\n\r\n_The Mont Cenis Tunnel_ was constructed to establish railway\r\ncommunication between France and Italy through the Alps. It was begun in\r\n1857, and after having been in progress of construction for thirteen\r\nyears, was opened for traffic in 1871. This tunnel was commenced by hand\r\nborings, being for the most part through solid rock, and its progress up\r\nto 1862 was so slow that it was estimated that thirty years would be\r\nrequired for its construction. Its earlier completion was due to the\r\nintroduction of rock drills operated by compressed air, which trebled\r\nthe rate of advance, and which device made a new epoch in all\r\nrock-boring and mining operations. This tunnel was cut from both ends at\r\nthe same time, and so accurate were the surveys in establishing the\r\nalignment of the two headings through the mountain mass, that, although\r\nthe tunnel was more than 7½ miles long, when the two headings came\r\ntogether in the middle, only a difference of one foot in level existed\r\nbetween them. When it is remembered that most of the 7½ miles of tunnel\r\nwas cut through solid rock, by boring and blasting, the immensity of the\r\nundertaking can be appreciated. As completed the tunnel is 8 miles long,\r\nand wide enough for a double track railway.\r\n\r\n_The St. Gothard Tunnel_ is another tunnel through the Alps, which\r\ninvolved even a longer and deeper cut through the mountains than the\r\nMont Cenis Tunnel. This is 9¼ miles long, and it was begun in 1872, the\r\nheadings joined in 1880, and the tunnel opened for traffic in 1882.\r\nAlthough by far the largest undertaking yet made, the improvement in\r\nrock-boring machinery enabled it to be constructed much more rapidly and\r\nat less expense.\r\n\r\nThe Arlberg is still another Alpine tunnel. It is 6½ miles long, was\r\ncommenced in 1880, and opened for traffic in 1884.\r\n\r\nTunneling under rivers presents many more difficulties than driving\r\nthrough the hardest rock. This is so by reason of the inflow of water.\r\nAmong successful tunnels of this kind may be named the Mersey and Severn\r\ntunnels in England, opened in 1886, and the St. Clair tunnel between the\r\nUnited States and Canada. The histories of the abandoned Detroit and\r\nHudson river tunnels are object lessons of the difficulties encountered\r\nin this class of work.\r\n\r\nAn important engineering invention for tunneling through silt or soft\r\nsoil is the so-called “shield.” This was first employed by the engineer\r\nBrunel in the construction of the Thames tunnel, which was begun in 1825\r\nand opened as a thoroughfare in 1843. The shield, as now used, is a sort\r\nof a cylinder or sleeve as large as the tunnel, which sleeve, as the\r\nexcavation proceeds in front of it, is forced ahead to act both as a\r\nring-shaped cutter and a protection to the workmen, its advance being\r\neffected by powerful hydraulic jacks or screws which find a back bearing\r\nagainst the completed wall of the tunnel. As the digging proceeds the\r\nshield is advanced, and a section of tunnel is built behind it which, in\r\nturn, furnishes a bearing for the jacks in the further advance of the\r\nshield.\r\n\r\nThis latter improvement was the invention of the late Alfred E. Beach,\r\nof the _Scientific American_, and was covered by him in patent No.\r\n91,071, June 8, 1869, and was used in driving the experimental pneumatic\r\nsubway constructed by him under Broadway, New York, in 1868-9, and also\r\nin the St. Clair River tunnel and the unfinished Hudson River tunnel and\r\nother works.\r\n\r\nSubsequent improvements made upon the shield by J. H. Greathead of\r\nEngland and covered by him in United States patents Nos. 360,959, April\r\n12, 1887; and 432,871, July 22, 1890, have greatly added to the value\r\nand efficiency of this device, and made it one of the leading\r\ninstrumentalities in tunnel construction.\r\n\r\n_Suez Canal._--It is said that the undertaking of connecting the\r\nMediterranean and Red Seas was considered as long ago as the time of\r\nHerodotus, and a small channel appears to have been opened twenty-five\r\ncenturies ago, but was subsequently abandoned. In 1847 the subject was\r\nagain taken up for serious consideration, the work begun in 1860, and\r\nfinished in 1869, at a cost of £20,500,000, or more than a hundred\r\nmillion dollars. The canal starts at Port Said, on the Mediterranean, a\r\nview of which with its ships of all nations and the canal reaching far\r\naway in the distance is seen in Fig. 231. The canal extends nearly due\r\nsouth to Suez on the Red Sea, a distance of about 100 miles, through\r\nbarren wastes of sand and an occasional lake. It was originally formed\r\nwith a bottom width of 72 feet, spreading out to 196 to 328 feet at the\r\ntop, and of a depth of 26 feet, but has since been increased in\r\ntransverse dimension to accommodate the great increase in travel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 231.--PORT SAID ENTRANCE TO SUEZ CANAL, SHOWING\r\nHARBOR WITH SHIPS OF ALL NATIONS, AND THE CANAL REACHING AWAY IN THE\r\nDISTANCE.]\r\n\r\nSixty great dredges were employed on the work, and the dredged material\r\nwas discharged in chutes on to the bank. The canal was the work of M. De\r\nLesseps, the eminent French engineer, and has proved a great success\r\nfrom both an engineering and financial standpoint. The stock is mainly\r\nheld in England, having been bought from the Khedive of Egypt. In 1898\r\nthe ships passing through the canal during the year reached the\r\nremarkable number of 3,503. The rate of tolls is 10 francs (about $2)\r\nper net ton. The gross tonnage of ships passing through in 1898 was\r\n12,962,632, the net tonnage 9,238,603. The total receipts for the year\r\nwere 87,906,255 francs (about $17,500,000), and the net profit\r\n63,441,987 francs (about $12,500,000). An average size ocean liner pays\r\nabout $5,000 for the privilege of sailing through this great ditch.\r\nAdmiral Dewey’s ship, the “Olympia,” returning from the Philippines,\r\npaid for her toll $3,516.04, and the “Chicago,” $3,165.95. Going the\r\nother way, our supply ship “Alexander” paid $4,107.99, while the\r\n“Glacier” paid $5,052.38. Ships making the passage through the canal\r\nmove slowly on account of the washing of the banks, about 22 hours\r\nbeing required, but the shortening of the travel of ships going east and\r\nwest, and the saving of life, property, and time, involved in avoiding\r\nthe circuitous and stormy passage around the Cape of Good Hope, has been\r\nof incalculable benefit to the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 232.--HERCULES DREDGER.]\r\n\r\nWith the construction of canals and harbors, great improvements have\r\nbeen made in dredges. Some of these are of the clam-shell type, some\r\nemploy the scoop and lever, others an endless series of buckets. An\r\nexample of the latter, used on the Panama Canal, is seen in Fig. 232.\r\nStill another form, and the most recent if not the most important is the\r\nhydraulic dredger, which, by rotating cutters, stirs and cuts the mud\r\nand silt, and by powerful suction pumps and immense tubes draws up the\r\nsemi-fluid mass and sends it to suitable points of discharge. The best\r\nknown of the latter type is the Bowers hydraulic dredge, covered by many\r\npatents, of which Nos. 318,859 and 318,860, May 26, 1885; 388,253,\r\nAugust 21, 1888; and 484,763, October 18, 1892, are the most important.\r\n\r\nFor surface excavations in solid earth the Lidgerwood Cableway is an\r\nimportant and labor saving device. A track cable is stretched from two\r\ndistant towers, and a bucket holding well on to a ton of earth is made\r\nto travel on a trolley running on said cable track, rising at one end\r\nout of the excavation, and dumping at the other end to fill in the\r\nexcavation as the cutting progresses, all in a continuous and\r\neconomical manner. This device is made under the patent to M. W. Locke,\r\nNo. 295,776, March 25, 1884, and comprehends many subsequent\r\nimprovements patented by Miller, Delaney, North and others. The Chicago\r\nDrainage Canal is a work just completed, which largely employed these\r\ndevices. This canal was designed to connect the Chicago River with the\r\nMississippi River, so as to send the sewage of Chicago down the\r\nMississippi instead of into Lake Michigan. Although it cost $33,000,000\r\nand required seven years for completion, the labor-saving cableways\r\ngreatly cheapened its cost and shortened the time of its construction.\r\n\r\nAmong the leading inventions relating to canal construction may be\r\nmentioned the bear-trap canal-lock gate (patents Nos. 229,682, 236,488\r\nand 552,063), and the Dutton pneumatic lift locks. The latter provide\r\nease and rapidity of action by a principle of balancing locks in pairs,\r\nand are covered by his patent No. 457,528, August 11, 1891, and others\r\nof subsequent date.\r\n\r\n_Artesian Wells_ represent an important branch of engineering work, and\r\nthey are so called from the province of Artois, in France, where they\r\nhave for a long time been in use. Extending several thousand feet into\r\nthe subterranean chambers of the earth, they have brought abundant water\r\nsupply to the surface all over the world, from the desert sands of\r\nSahara to the hotels of the modern city; they have contributed oil and\r\ngas in incredible quantities to supply light and heat, and have made\r\nvaluable additions to the salt supply of the world.\r\n\r\nThey are driven by reciprocating a ponderous chisel-shaped drill within\r\nan iron tube, six inches more or less in diameter, which is built up in\r\nsections, and moved down as the cutting descends. The drill is\r\nreciprocated by a suspending rope from machinery in a derrick, and in\r\norder to give a hammer-like blow to the chisel a pair of ponderous iron\r\nlinks coupled together like those of a chain, and called a “_drill jar_”\r\nconnect the drill to the rope. As the sections of the link slide over\r\neach other they come together with a hammer blow at the moment of\r\nlifting that dislodges the drill from the rock, and on the descending\r\nmovement they come together with a hammering blow immediately after the\r\ndrill touches the rock to drive it into the same. The first United\r\nStates patent for a drill jar is that to Morris, No. 2,243, September 4,\r\n1841. When an oil well ceases to flow, it is rejuvenated by being\r\n“shot,” which is quite contrary to the ordinary conception of prolonging\r\nlife. For this purpose a dynamite cartridge is exploded at the lower end\r\nof the well, which shatters the rock, and, in opening up new channels\r\nof flow for the oil, renews the yield. Many patented inventions have\r\nbeen made in the field of well boring, and the discovery of coal oil in\r\nthe United States in 1859 has developed a great industry and built up\r\nenormous fortunes. The amount of petroleum produced in the United States\r\nin 1896 was 60,960,361 barrels, the largest yield on record. In 1897 the\r\namount was 60,568,081 barrels.\r\n\r\nOf less consequence than the artesian well, but finding many useful\r\napplications, is the drive well. A metal tube with a perforated lower\r\nend is driven down by hammers into the ground, and furnishes a quick and\r\ncheap source of water supply. This was invented by Col. Green in 1861,\r\nin meeting the necessities of his military camp during the civil war,\r\nand was patented by him January 14, 1868, No. 73,425.\r\n\r\n_Rock Drills._--In mining and tunneling through rock, the rock drill has\r\nbeen the implement of paramount importance and utility. For boring by\r\nrotary action the diamond drill is most effective. This uses bits set\r\nwith diamonds which, by their extreme hardness, cut through the most\r\nrefractory rock with great rapidity. It was invented by Hermann and\r\npatented by him in France, June 3, 1854.\r\n\r\nMore important, however, is the compressed air rock drill, in which a\r\npiston has the drill bit directly on its piston rod and cuts by a\r\nreciprocating action. The piston is actuated by compressed air admitted\r\nalternately to its opposite sides in an automatic manner by valves. The\r\ncompressed air conveyed to the drill in the tunnel or mine not only\r\noperates the drill, but helps to ventilate the tunnel. As early as 1849\r\nClarke and Motley, in England, invented a machine drill, and in 1851\r\nFowle devised a similar machine, having the drill attached directly to\r\nthe piston cross head. The Hoosac and Mont Cenis tunnels greatly\r\nstimulated invention in this field, and among the notable drills of this\r\nclass may be named the Burleigh, Ingersoll, and Sergeant. The Burleigh\r\ndrill was brought out in 1866, and was covered by patents Nos. 52,960,\r\n52,961 and 59,960 of that year, and 113,850 of 1871, and the Ingersoll\r\ndrill, by patents No. 112,254, and No. 120,279, of 1871.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 233.--BLOWING UP FLOOD ROCK.]\r\n\r\n_Blasting._--The discovery of nitro-glycerine in 1846, followed by its\r\nconvenient commercial preparation in the form of dynamite, gave a great\r\nimpetus to blasting. Notable as the largest operation of the kind in the\r\ncentury is the blowing up of Flood Rock, in the path of commerce between\r\nNew York City and Long Island Sound. The dangerous character of this and\r\nother rocks in this vicinity gave long ago to this channel the\r\nsignificant name of Hell Gate. The undermining of the rocks by shafts\r\nand galleries is seen in Fig. 233, and the final blowing up of the same\r\nin a single blast was the culmination of a series of similar operations\r\nat this point tending to safer navigation. On October 10, 1885, 40,000\r\ncartridges, containing 75,000 pounds of dynamite and 240,000 pounds of\r\n_rack-a-rock_, were, by the touching of a button and the closing of an\r\nelectric circuit, simultaneously exploded. In the twinkling of an eye\r\nnine acres of solid rock were shattered into fragments by the prodigious\r\nforce, and a vast upheaval of water 1,400 feet long, 800 feet wide, and\r\n200 feet high, sprang into the air in tangled and gigantic fountains. As\r\nthe termination of the most stupendous piece of engineering of the kind\r\nthe world has ever seen, and with spectacular features fitting the\r\nenormous expense of $1,000,000, which the work cost, this final scene\r\nput an end to the menaces of Flood Rock, and wiped out of existence the\r\nworst dangers of Hell Gate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 234.--CROSS SECTION MISSISSIPPI JETTIES.]\r\n\r\n_Mississippi Jetties._--The broad bar and shallow waters at the mouth of\r\nthe Mississippi involved such an obstruction to commerce that in 1872 it\r\nreceived the attention of Congress, resulting in the building, by Capt.\r\nEads, of the celebrated jetties. They were begun in 1875 and finished in\r\n1879, and cost $5,250,000. The channel obtained was 30 feet deep and 200\r\nfeet wide. Its construction involved the building across the bar and out\r\ninto the Gulf of Mexico two long reaches of parallel embankments, called\r\njetties. This was effected by sinking mattresses of willow branches\r\nbound together and weighted with stone. These were laid in four layers,\r\nand when submerged, and resting upon the bottom, were covered with a\r\nlayer of loose stone, and this in turn was surmounted with a capping of\r\nconcrete blocks, as seen in cross section in Fig. 234. These jetties so\r\nconcentrated the flow of waters into a narrow channel as to cause its\r\nincreased velocity to wash out the mud and silt and deepen the channel.\r\nThe immensity of the work may be measured by the quantity of material\r\nused in its construction, which included 6,000,000 cubic yards of willow\r\nmattresses, 1,000,000 cubic yards of stone, 13,000,000 feet (board\r\nmeasure) of lumber, and 8,000,000 cubic yards of concrete. The\r\nmattresses were laid 35 to 50 feet wide at the bottom, which width was\r\nconsiderably increased by the superimposed layer of stone, and the\r\njetties extended 2¼ miles into the sea. Their influence upon commerce is\r\nindicated by the fact that before their construction the annual grain\r\nexport from New Orleans was less than half a million bushels, and in\r\n1880, the year following their completion, it was increased to\r\n14,000,000 bushels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 235.--INTERIOR CONSTRUCTION MODERN STEEL BUILDING.]\r\n\r\n_High Buildings._--A distinct feature of modern architecture is the\r\nenormously tall steel frame building known as the “sky scraper.” The\r\nincreasing value of city lots first brought about the vertical extension\r\nof buildings to a greater number of stories, and the necessity for\r\nmaking them fireproof, coupled with the desire to avoid loss of interior\r\nspace, due to thick walls at the base, made a demand for a different\r\nstyle of architecture. To meet this a skeleton frame of steel is bolted\r\ntogether in unitary structure, the floors being all carried on the steel\r\nframe, and the outer masonry walls being relatively thin, and carrying\r\nonly their own weight. In Fig. 235 is shown an example of the interior\r\nstructure of such a building. The vertical columns are erected upon a\r\nvery firm foundation, and to them are bolted, on the floor levels,\r\nhorizontal I-beams and girders, stayed by tie rods, which I-beams\r\nreceive between them hollow fireproof tile to form the floor. The outer\r\nmasonry walls are built around the skeleton frame, as seen in Fig. 236,\r\nand the details of connections for the floor members appear in Fig. 237.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 236.--ENCLOSURE OF STEEL FRAME BY MASONRY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 237.--DETAILS OF INTERNAL CONSTRUCTION.]\r\n\r\nThe construction of iron buildings began about the middle of the\r\ncentury. In 1845 Peter Cooper erected the largest rolling mill at that\r\ntime in the United States for making railroad iron, and at this mill\r\nwrought iron beams for fireproof buildings were first rolled. In the\r\nbuilding of the Cooper Institute in New York City in 1857 he was the\r\nfirst to employ such beams with brick arches to support the floors. The\r\nunifying of the iron work into an integral skeleton frame, for relieving\r\nthe side walls of the weight of the floors is, however, a comparatively\r\nrecent development, and this has so raised the height of the modern\r\noffice building as to cause it to impress the observer as an obelisk\r\nrather than a place of habitation. An earthquake-proof steel palace for\r\nthe Crown Prince of Japan is one of the modern applications of steel in\r\narchitecture. It is being built by American engineers, and is to cost\r\n$3,000,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 238.--THE EIFFEL TOWER. HEIGHT, 984 FEET. TALLEST\r\nSTRUCTURE IN THE WORLD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 239.--WASHINGTON’S MONUMENT. HEIGHT 555 FEET, 5½\r\nINCHES. HIGHEST MASONRY STRUCTURE IN THE WORLD.]\r\n\r\n_Eiffel Tower._--Loftiest among the high structures of the world, and\r\nsignificant as indicating the possibilities of iron construction, the\r\nEiffel Tower of the Paris Exposition of 1889 was a distinct achievement\r\nin the engineering world. It is seen in Fig. 238. It is 984 feet high,\r\nand 410 feet across its foundation, and has a supporting base of four\r\nindependent lattice work piers. In the top was constructed a scientific\r\nlaboratory surmounted by a lantern containing a powerful electric light.\r\nThe total weight of iron in the structure is about 7,000 tons, the\r\nweight of the rivets alone being 450 tons, and the total number of them\r\n2,500,000. The level of the first story is marked by a bold frieze, on\r\nthe panels of which, around all four faces, were inscribed in gigantic\r\nletters of gold the names of the famous Frenchmen of the century. The\r\nsummit of the tower was reached by staircases containing 1,793 steps,\r\nand by hydraulic elevators running in four stages. The cost of this\r\nstructure was nearly $1,000,000.\r\n\r\n_Washington’s Monument._--Next in height to the Eiffel Tower, and being,\r\nin fact, the tallest masonry structure in the world, this noble obelisk,\r\nby its simplicity, boldness and solidity, challenges the admiration of\r\nevery visitor, and gratifies the pride of every patriot. It is seen in\r\nFig. 239, and is 555 feet 5½ inches high, 55 feet square at the base,\r\nand 34 feet square at the top. The walls are 15 feet thick at the base,\r\nand 18 inches at the top, and its summit is reached by an internal\r\nwinding staircase and a central elevator. At the height of 504 feet the\r\nwalls are pierced with port holes, from which a magnificent view is had\r\nof the capital city and surrounding country. The summit is crowned with\r\na cap of aluminum, inscribed _Laus Deo_. The foundation of rock and\r\ncement is 36 feet deep and 126 feet square, and the total cost of the\r\nmonument was $1,300,000. The corner stone was laid in 1848. In 1855 the\r\nwork was discontinued at the height of 152 feet, from lack of funds. In\r\n1878 it was resumed by appropriation from Congress, and completed and\r\ndedicated in 1885, under the direction of Col. Thomas L. Casey, of the\r\nUnited States Corps of Engineers.\r\n\r\n_The Capitol Building._--Representing the heart of the great American\r\nRepublic, and overlooking its Capital City, this grand building, shown\r\nin Fig. 240, is a poem in architecture. Massive, symmetrical and\r\nharmonious, its highest point reaches 307½ feet above the plaza on the\r\neast. It is 751 feet 4 inches long, 350 feet wide, and the walls of the\r\nbuilding proper cover 3½ acres. Crowning the center of the building is\r\nthe imposing dome of iron, surmounted by a lantern, and above this is\r\nthe bronze statue of Freedom, 19 feet 6 inches high, and weighing\r\n14,985 pounds, the latter being set in place December 2, 1863. The dome\r\nis 135 feet 5 inches in diameter at the base, and the open space of the\r\nrotunda within is 96 feet in diameter and 180 feet high.\r\n\r\nThe corner stone of the original building was laid in 1793 by\r\nWashington. The first session of Congress held there was in 1800, while\r\nthe building was still incomplete. The original building was finished\r\nin 1811. In 1814 it was partly burned by the British. In 1815\r\nreconstruction was begun, and completed in 1827. In 1850 Congress passed\r\nan act authorizing the extension of the Capitol, which resulted in the\r\nbuilding of the north and south wings, containing the present Senate\r\nChamber and Hall of the House of Representatives. The corner stones of\r\nthe extension were laid by President Fillmore in 1851, Daniel Webster\r\nbeing the orator of the occasion, and the wings were finished in 1867.\r\nSince this time handsome additions in the shape of marble terraces on\r\nthe west front have added greatly to the beauty and apparent size of the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 240.--THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL. LENGTH, 751⅓ FEET;\r\nWIDTH, 350 FEET; HEIGHT, 307½ FEET; BUILDING COVERS 3½ ACRES.]\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to give anything like an adequate review of the\r\nengineering inventions and achievements of the Nineteenth Century in a\r\nsingle chapter, and only the most noteworthy have been mentioned. The\r\nmodern life of the world, however, has been replete with the resourceful\r\nexpedients of the engineer, and the ingenious instrumentalities invented\r\nby him to carry out his plans. There have been about 1,000 patents\r\ngranted for bridges, about 2,500 for excavating apparatus, and about\r\n1,500 for hydraulic engineering. In mining the safety-lamp of Sir\r\nHumphrey Davy, in 1815, has been followed by stamp mills, rock-drills,\r\nderricks, and hoisting and lowering apparatus, and lately by hydraulic\r\nmining apparatus, by which a stream of water under high pressure is made\r\nto wash away a mountain side. Apparatus for loading and unloading,\r\npneumatic conveyors, great systems of irrigation, lighthouses,\r\nbreakwaters, pile drivers, dry-docks, ship railways, road-making\r\napparatus, fire escapes, fireproof buildings, water towers, and\r\nfiltration plants have been devised, constructed and utilized. Many\r\ngigantic schemes, already begun, still await successful completion,\r\namong which may be named the draining of the Zuyder Zee, the Siberian\r\nrailway, the Panama and Nicaraguan Canals, the Simplon tunnel, the new\r\nEast River Bridge, and the Rapid Transit Tunnel under New York City;\r\nwhile a bridge or tunnel across the English Channel, a ship canal for\r\nFrance, connecting the Bay of Biscay with the Mediterranean, a tunnel\r\nunder the Straits of Gibraltar, and a ship canal connecting the great\r\nlakes with the Gulf of Mexico, are among the possible achievements which\r\nchallenge the engineer of the Twentieth Century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nWOODWORKING.\r\n\r\n    EARLY MACHINES OF SIR SAMUEL BENTHAM--EVOLUTION OF THE SAW--CIRCULAR\r\n    SAW--HAMMERING TO TENSION--STEAM FEED FOR SAW MILL CARRIAGE--QUARTER\r\n    SAWING--THE BAND SAW--PLANING MACHINES--THE WOODWORTH PLANER--THE\r\n    WOODBURY YIELDING PRESSURE BAR--THE UNIVERSAL WOODWORKER--THE\r\n    BLANCHARD LATHE--MORTISING MACHINES--SPECIAL WOODWORKING MACHINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurrounded as we are in the modern home with beautiful and artistic\r\nfurniture, and installed in comfortable and inexpensive houses, one does\r\nnot appreciate the contrast which the life of the average citizen of\r\nto-day presents to that of his great-grandfather in the matter of his\r\ndwelling house appointments. A hundred years ago most of the dwellings\r\nof the middle and poorer classes were crudely made, with clap-boards and\r\njoists laboriously hewn with the broad ax, and the roof was covered with\r\nsplit shingles. Uncouth and clumsy doors, windows and blinds, were\r\nframed on the simplest utilitarian basis, and a scanty supply of rude\r\nhand-made furniture imperfectly filled the simple wants of the home.\r\nTo-day nearly every cottage has beautifully moulded trimmings, paneled\r\ndoors, handsomely carved mantels and turned balusters, all furnished at\r\nan insignificant price, and art has so added its æsthetic values to the\r\nfurniture and other useful things in wood, that beautiful, artistic and\r\ntasteful homes are no longer confined to the rich, but may be enjoyed by\r\nall. This great change has been brought about by the sawmill, the\r\nplaning machine, mortising and boring machines, and the turning lathe.\r\n\r\nPre-eminent in the field of woodworking machinery, and worthy to be\r\ncalled the father of the art, is to be mentioned the name of Gen. Sir\r\nSamuel Bentham, of England, whose inventions in the last decade of the\r\nEighteenth Century formed the nucleus of the modern art of woodworking.\r\n\r\n_The Saw_ was the great pioneer in woodworking machinery, and the\r\ncircular saw has, in the Nineteenth Century, been the representative\r\ntype. Pushing its way along the outskirts of civilization, its\r\nglistening and apparently motionless disk, filled with a hidden, but\r\nterrific energy, and singing a merry tune in the clearings, has\r\ntransformed trees into tenements, forests into firesides, and altered\r\nthe face of the earth, the record of its work being only measured by the\r\nimmensity of the forests which it has depleted. It is not possible to\r\nfix the date of the first circular saw, for rotary cutting action dates\r\nfrom the ancient turning lathes. The earliest description of a circular\r\nsaw is to be found in the British patent to Miller, No. 1,152, of 1777.\r\nIt was not until the Nineteenth Century, however, that it was generally\r\napplied, and its great work belongs to this period. The preceding saws\r\nwere of the straight, reciprocating kind. The old pit-saw is the\r\nearliest form, and in course of time the men were replaced by machinery\r\nto form the “muley” saw, the man in the pit being replaced by a\r\nmechanical “pitman,” which accounts for the etymology of the word. With\r\nthe “muley” saw the log was held at each end, and each end shifted\r\nalternately to set for a new cut. The first development was along the\r\nlines of this form of saw, and to increase its efficiency the saws were\r\narranged in gangs, so as to make a number of cuts at one pass of the\r\nlog. This type was especially used in Europe, but on the up stroke there\r\nwas no work being done, and hence half of the time was lost. This and\r\nother difficulties led finally to the adoption of the circular type,\r\nwhose continuous cut and high speed saved much time and presented many\r\nother advantages. A representative example of the circular saw is given\r\nin Fig. 241.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 241.--PORTABLE CIRCULAR SAW.]\r\n\r\nWith the increased diameter and peripheral speed of the circular saw,\r\nhowever, a grave difficulty presented itself. The saw would heat at its\r\nperiphery, and its rim portion expanding without commensurate expansion\r\nof the central portion, would cause the saw to crack and fly to pieces\r\nunder the tremendous centrifugal force. This difficulty is provided for\r\nby what is known as “_hammering to tension_,” _i. e._, the saw is\r\nhammered to a gradually increasing state of compression from the rim to\r\nthe center, thus causing an initial expansion or spread of the molecules\r\nof metal of the central parts of the saw, which is stored up as an\r\nelastic expansive force that accommodates itself to the tension caused\r\nby the expansion of the rim, and prevents the unequal and destructive\r\nstrain, due to the expansion of the rim from the great heat of friction\r\nin passing through the log.\r\n\r\nMounted upon a portable frame, this machine was put to its great work\r\nupon the logs in the forests of America, and for many years this type of\r\nsawmill held its sway, and an enormous amount of work was done through\r\nits agency. Among its useful accessories were the set-works for\r\nadjusting the log holding knees to the position for a new cut, log\r\nturners for rotating the log to change the plane of the cut, and the\r\nrack and pinion feed, by which the saw carriage was run back and forth.\r\nFollowing the rack and pinion feed came the rope feed, in which a rope\r\nwrapped around a drum was carried at its opposite ends over pulleys and\r\nback to the opposite ends of the carriage, which was thereby carried\r\nback and forth by the forward or backward movement of the drum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 242.--DIRECT-ACTING STEAM FEED SAWMILL CARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\nThe greatest advance in sawmills in recent years, however, has been the\r\nsteam feed, in which a very long steam cylinder was provided with a\r\npiston, whose long rod was directly attached to the saw carriage, and\r\nthe latter moved back and forth by the admission of steam alternately\r\nto opposite sides of the piston. This type of feed, also known as the\r\n_shot gun_ feed, from the resemblance of the long cylinder to a gun\r\nbarrel, was invented about twenty-five years ago, by De Witt C.\r\nPrescott, and is covered by his patent, No. 174,004, February 22, 1876,\r\nlater improvements being shown in his patent, No. 360,972, April 12,\r\n1887. The value of the steam feed was to increase the speed and\r\nefficiency of the saw, by expediting the movement of its carriage, as\r\nmany as six boards per minute being cut by its aid from a log of average\r\nlength. An example of a modern steam feed for sawmill carriages is seen\r\nin Fig. 242. With the modern development of the art the ease and\r\nrapidity of steam action have recommended it for use in most all of the\r\nwork of the sawmill, and the direct application of steam pistons\r\nworking in cylinders has been utilized for canting, kicking, flipping\r\nand rolling the logs, lifting the stock, taking away the boards, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 243.--METHOD OF SHAPING AND HOLDING LOG FOR QUARTER\r\nSAWING.]\r\n\r\nBeautifully finished furniture in quartered oak has always excited the\r\npleasure, and piqued the curiosity of the uninformed as to how this\r\nresult is obtained. Fig. 243 illustrates the method of sawing to produce\r\nthis effect. The log is simply divided longitudinally into four\r\nquarters, and the quarter sections are then cut by the vertical plane of\r\nthe saw at an oblique angle to the sawed sides, which brings to the\r\nsurface of the boards the peculiar flecks or patches of the wood’s grain\r\nso much admired when finished and polished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 244.--AUTOMATIC BAND RIP SAW.]\r\n\r\nThe _Band Saw_ is an endless belt of steel having teeth formed along one\r\nedge and traveling continuously around an upper and lower pulley, with\r\nits toothed edge presented to the timber to be cut, as seen in Fig. 244,\r\nwhich represents a form of band saw made by the J. A. Fay & Egan\r\nCompany, of Cincinnati. A form of band saw is found as early as 1808, in\r\nBritish patent No. 3,105, to Newberry. On March 25, 1834, a French\r\npatent was granted for a band saw to Etiennot, No. 3,397. The first\r\nUnited States patent for a band saw was granted to B. Barker, January 6,\r\n1836, but it remained for the last quarter of the Nineteenth Century to\r\ngive the band saw its prominence in woodworking machines. That it did\r\nnot find general application at an earlier period was due to the\r\ndifficulty experienced in securely and evenly joining the ends of the\r\nband. For many years the only moderately successful band saws were made\r\nin France, but expert mechanical skill has so mastered the problem that\r\nin recent years the band saw has gone to the very front in wood-sawing\r\nmachinery. To-day it is in service in sizes from a delicate filament,\r\nused for scroll sawing and not larger than a baby’s ribbon, to an\r\nenormous steel belt 50 feet in peripheral measurement, and 12 inches\r\nwide, traveling over pulleys 8 feet in diameter, making 500 revolutions\r\nper minute, and tearing its way through logs much too large for any\r\ncircular saw, at the rate of nearly two miles a minute. A modern form of\r\nsuch a saw is seen in Fig. 245. Prescott’s patents, Nos. 368,731 and\r\n369,881, of 1887; 416,012, of 1889, and 472,586 and 478,817, of 1892,\r\nrepresent some of the important developments in the band saw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 245.--MODERN BAND SAW FOR LARGE TIMBER.]\r\n\r\nWhen the band saw is applied to cutting logs the backward movement of\r\nthe carriage would, if there were any slivers on the cut face of the\r\nlog, be liable to force those slivers against the smooth edge of the\r\nband saw, and distort and possibly break it. To obviate this the saw\r\ncarriage is provided with a lateral adjustment on the back movement\r\ncalled an “off-set,” so that the log returns for a new cut out of\r\ncontact with the saw. Examples of such off-setting are found in patents\r\nto Gowen, No. 383,460, May 29, 1888, and No. 401,945, April 23, 1889,\r\nand Hinkley, No. 368,669, August 23, 1887. A modern form of the band\r\nsaw, however, has teeth on both its edges, which requires no off-setting\r\nmechanism, but cuts in both directions. An example of this, known as\r\nthe telescopic band mill, is made by the Edward P. Allis Company, of\r\nMilwaukee.\r\n\r\nA saw which planes, as well as severs, is shown in patents to Douglass,\r\nNos. 431,510, July 1, 1890, and 542,630, July 16, 1895. Steam power\r\nmechanism for operating the knees is shown in patent to Wilkin, No.\r\n317,256, May 5, 1885. Means for quarter sawing in both directions of log\r\ntravel are shown in patent to Gray, No. 550,825, December 3, 1895. Means\r\nfor operating log turners and log loaders appear in patents to Hill, No.\r\n496,938, May 9, 1893; No. 466,682, January 5, 1892; No. 526,624,\r\nSeptember 25, 1894, and Kelly, No. 497,098, May 9, 1893. A self cooling\r\ncircular saw is found in patent to Jenks, No. 193,004, July 10, 1877;\r\nshingle sawing machines in patents to O’Connor, No. 358,474, March 1,\r\n1887, and No. 292,347, January 22, 1884, and Perkins, No. 380,346, April\r\n3, 1888; and means for severing veneer spirally and dividing it into\r\ncompleted staves, are shown in patent to Hayne, No. 509,534, November\r\n28, 1893.\r\n\r\n_Planing Machines._--While the saw plays the initial part of shaping the\r\nrough logs into lumber, it is to the planing machine that the\r\nrefinements of woodworking are due. Its rapidly revolving cutter head\r\nreduces the uneven thickness of the lumber to an exact gauge, and\r\nsimultaneously imparts the fine smooth surface. The planing machine is\r\norganized in various shapes for different uses. When the cutters are\r\nstraight and arranged horizontally, it is a simple _planer_. When the\r\ncutters are short and arranged to work on the edge of the board they are\r\nknown as _edgers_; when the edges are cut into tongues and grooves it is\r\ncalled a _matching machine_; and when the cutters have a curved\r\nornamental contour it is known as a _molding machine_, and is used for\r\ncutting the ornamental contour for house trimmings and various\r\nornamental uses.\r\n\r\nThe planing machine was one of the many woodworking devices invented by\r\nGeneral Bentham. His first machine, British patent No. 1,838, of 1791,\r\nwas a reciprocating machine, but in his British patent No. 1,951, of\r\n1793, he described the rotary form along with a great variety of other\r\nwoodworking machinery.\r\n\r\nBramah’s planer, British patent No. 2,652, of 1802, was about the first\r\nplaning machine of the Nineteenth Century. It is known as a transverse\r\nplaner, the cutters being on the lower surface of a horizontal disc,\r\nwhich is fixed to a vertical revolving shaft, and overhangs the board\r\npassing beneath it, the cutters revolving in a plane parallel with the\r\nupper surface of the board. The planing machine of Muir, of Glasgow,\r\nBritish patent No. 5,502, of 1827, was designed for making boards for\r\nflooring, and represented a considerable advance in the art.\r\n\r\nWith the greater wooded areas of America, the rapid growth of the young\r\nrepublic, and the resourceful spirit of its new civilization, the\r\nleading activities in woodworking machinery were in the second quarter\r\nof the Nineteenth Century transferred to the United States, and a\r\nphenomenal growth in this art ensued. Conspicuous among the early\r\nplaning machine patents in the United States was that granted to William\r\nWoodworth, December 27, 1828. This covered broadly the combination of\r\nthe cutting cylinders, and rolls for holding the boards against the\r\ncutting cylinders, and also means for tongueing and grooving at one\r\noperation. The revolving cutting cylinder had been used by Bentham\r\nthirty-five years before, and rollers for feeding lumber to circular\r\nsaws were described in Hammond’s British patent No. 3,459, of 1811, but\r\nWoodworth did not employ his rolls for feeding, as a rack and pinion\r\nwere provided for that, but his rolls had a co-active relation with a\r\nplaner cylinder, or cutter head, in holding the board against the\r\ntendency of the cutter head to pull the board toward it. A patent was\r\ngranted to Woodworth for these two features in combination, which patent\r\nwas reissued July 8, 1845, twice extended, and for a period of\r\ntwenty-eight years from its first grant, exerted an oppressive monopoly\r\nin this art, since it covered the combination of the two necessary\r\nelements of every practical planer.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Woodworth patent came a host of minor improvements, among\r\nwhich were the Woodbury patents, extending through the period of the\r\nthird quarter of the Nineteenth Century, and prominent among which is\r\nthe patent to J. P. Woodbury, No. 138,462, April 20, 1873, covering\r\nbroadly a rotary cutter head combined with a yielding pressure bar to\r\nhold the board against the lifting action of the cutter head.\r\n\r\nIn modern planing machinery the climax of utility is reached in the\r\nso-called _universal woodworker_. This is the versatile Jack-of-all-work\r\nin the planing mill. It planes flat, moulded, rabbeted, or beaded\r\nsurfaces; it saws with both the rip and crosscut action; it cuts tongues\r\nand grooves; makes miters, chamfers, wedges, mortises and tenons, and is\r\nthe general utility machine of the shop.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 246 is shown a well known form of planing machine. Its work is\r\nto plane the surfaces of boards, and to cut the edges into tongues and\r\ngroves, such as are required for flooring. This machine planes boards up\r\nto 24 inches wide and 6 inches thick, and will tongue and grove 14\r\ninches wide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 246.--24-INCH SINGLE SURFACER AND MATCHER.]\r\n\r\n_Wood Turning._--To this ancient art Blanchard added, in 1819, his very\r\ningenious and important improvement for turning irregular forms. A few\r\nefforts at irregular turning had been made before, but in the arts\r\ngenerally only circular forms had been turned. With Blanchard’s\r\nimprovement, patented January 20, 1820, any irregular form, such as a\r\nshoe-last, gun-stock, ax-handle, wheel-spokes, etc., could be smoothly\r\nand expeditiously turned and finished in any required shape. In the\r\nordinary lathe the work is revolved rapidly, and the cutting tool is\r\nheld stationary, or only slowly shifted in the hand. In the Blanchard\r\nlathe the work is hung in a swinging frame, and turned very slowly to\r\nbring its different sides to the cutting action, and the cutting tool is\r\nconstructed as a rapidly revolving disk, against which the work is\r\nprojected bodily by the oscillation of the swinging frame, to\r\naccommodate the irregularities of the form. In order to do this\r\nautomatically, a pattern or model of the article to be turned was also\r\nhung in the swinging frame, and made to slowly revolve and bear against\r\na pattern wheel, which, acting upon the swinging frame carrying the\r\nwork, caused it to advance to or recede from the cutting disc exactly in\r\nproportion to the contour of the model, and thus cause the revolving\r\ncutters to cut the block as it turns synchronously with the model, to a\r\nshape exactly corresponding to said model.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 247.--BLANCHARD LATHE.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 247 is shown a perspective view of Blanchard’s lathe, as\r\npatented January 20, 1820. H is a swinging frame, carrying the model T\r\nof a shoe last, and a roughed-out block U, partly converted into a shoe\r\nlast. A sliding frame, fed horizontally by a screw, carries a pattern\r\nwheel K, that bears against the pattern T, and a rotary cutter E, acting\r\nagainst the roughed-out block U. The revolving disk-shaped cutter E is\r\nrotated by a pulley and belt from a drum, which latter is made long\r\nenough to accommodate the travel of the frame. The pattern T and block U\r\nare advanced to contact respectively, with pattern wheel K and cutter E\r\nby the swinging action of frame H, and as the pattern T and block U are\r\nslowly revolved, the travel of T against K is made to react on frame H\r\nand regulate the advance of U against E, with the result that the rough\r\nblock U is cut to the identical shape of the pattern T.\r\n\r\nAmong modern developments in this art may be mentioned the patents to\r\nKimball, No. 471,006, March 15, 1892, and No. 498,170, May 23, 1893, the\r\nlatter showing ingenious means whereby shoe lasts of the same length,\r\nbut varying widths, may be turned. A polygonal-form lathe is shown in\r\npatent to Merritt, No. 504,812, September 12, 1893; a multiple lathe in\r\npatents to Albee, No. 429,297, June 3, 1890, and Aram, No. 550,401,\r\nNovember 26, 1895; a tubular lathe in patent to Lenhart, No. 355,540,\r\nJanuary 4, 1887; and a spiral cutting lathe in patent to Mackintosh, No.\r\n396,283, January 15, 1889.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 248.--MORTISING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\n_Mortising Machines_ have exercised an important influence in mill work\r\nin the joining of the stiles in doors, sashes and blinds, and in the\r\nmaking of furniture. The Fay & Egan machine is seen in Fig. 248. The\r\nself acting mortising machine was among the numerous early contributions\r\nof Gen. Bentham in woodworking machinery, and was described in his\r\nBritish patent No. 1,951, of 1793, a number of them having been made by\r\nhim for the British Admiralty. Brunel’s mortising machine for making\r\nships’ blocks is another early form described in British patent No.\r\n2,478, of 1801. As representing novel departures in this art, the\r\nendless chain mortising machine shown in Douglas patent, No. 379,566,\r\nMarch 20, 1888, may be mentioned, and reissue patent, No. 10,655,\r\nOctober 27, 1885, to Oppenheimer, and No. 461,666, October 20, 1891, to\r\nCharlton, are examples of mortising augers.\r\n\r\n_Special Woodworking Machines._--Of these there have been great numbers\r\nand variety. No sooner does an article become extensively used than a\r\nmachine is made for turning it out automatically. Indeed, machines for\r\ncheaply turning out articles have, in many cases, led the way to popular\r\nuse of the article by the extreme cheapness of its production.\r\n\r\nAmong various automatic machines for making special articles may be\r\nmentioned those for making clothes pins, scooping out wood trays,\r\npointing skewers, dovetailing box blanks, cutting sash stile pockets,\r\ncutting and packing toothpicks, making matches, boxing matches,\r\nduplicating carvings, cutting bungs, cutting corks, making umbrella\r\nsticks, making brush blocks, boring chair legs, screw-driving machines,\r\nbox nailing machines, making cigar boxes, nailing baskets, wiring box\r\nblanks, applying slats, gluing boxes, gluing slate frames, making\r\nveneers, bushing mortises, covering piano hammers, making staves and\r\nbarrels, making fruit baskets, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to give in any brief review a proper conception of the\r\nimmensity of the woodworking industry in the United States. It is\r\nestimated in the Patent Office that about 8,000 patents have been\r\ngranted for woodworking machines. Besides this there are about 5,000\r\npatents in the separate class of wood sawing, about an equal number for\r\nwoodworking tools, and these, with other patented inventions in wood\r\nturning, coopering, or the making of barrels, wheelwrighting, and other\r\nminor classes, give some idea of the activity in this great field of\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThe exports of wood and wooden manufactures from the United States in\r\n1899 amounted to $41,489,526, of which $15,031,176 were for finished\r\nboards, $4,107,350 for barrels, staves and heads, and $3,571,375 for\r\nhousehold furniture, but this is only an insignificant portion, for with\r\na prosperous country, an abundance of wood, and a thrifty and ambitious\r\nnation of home builders, the home consumption has been incalculable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nMETAL WORKING.\r\n\r\n    EARLY IRON FURNACE--OPERATIONS OF LORD DUDLEY, ABRAHAM DARBY AND\r\n    HENRY CORT--NEILSON’S HOT BLAST--GREAT BLAST FURNACES OF MODERN\r\n    TIMES--THE PUDDLING FURNACE--BESSEMER STEEL AND THE CONVERTER--OPEN\r\n    HEARTH STEEL--SIEMENS’ REGENERATIVE FURNACE--SIEMENS-MARTIN PROCESS\r\n    --ARMOR PLATE--MAKING HORSE SHOES--SCREWS AND SPECIAL MACHINES--\r\n    ELECTRIC WELDING, ANNEALING AND TEMPERING--COATING WITH METAL--METAL\r\n    FOUNDING--BARBED WIRE MACHINES--MAKING NAILS, PINS, ETC.--MAKING\r\n    SHOT--ALLOYS--MAKING ALUMINUM, AND METALLURGY OF RARER METALS--THE\r\n    CYANIDE PROCESS--ELECTRIC CONCENTRATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake away iron and steel from the resources of modern life, and the\r\nwhole fabric of civilization disintegrates. The railroad, steam engine\r\nand steamship, the dynamo and electric motor, the telegraph and\r\ntelephone, agricultural implements of all sorts, grinding mills,\r\nspinning machines and looms, battleships and firearms, stoves and\r\nfurnaces, the printing press, and tools of all sorts--each and every one\r\nwould be robbed of its essential basic material, without which it cannot\r\nexist. Steam and electricity may be the heart and soul of the world’s\r\nlife, but iron is its great body. King among metals, it gives its name\r\nto the present cycle, as the “Iron Age,” and the Nineteenth Century has\r\ncrowned it with such refinements of shape, and endowed it with such\r\nattributes of utility, and such grandeur of estate, that its powers in\r\norganized machinery have, for effective service, risen to all the\r\nfunctions and dignity of human capacity--except that of thought.\r\n\r\nA crude gift of nature, in the mountain side, it remained, however, a\r\nsodden mass until extracted, refined, and wrought into shape by the\r\ngenius of man. Yielding to the magical touch of invention, it has been\r\ncast in moulds into cannon, mills, plowshares, and ten thousand\r\narticles; it has been drawn into wire of any fineness and length to form\r\ncables for great suspension bridges; it has been rolled into rails that\r\ngrill the continents; into sheets that cover our roofs; and into nails\r\nthat hold our houses together. It has been wrought into a softness that\r\nlends its susceptible nature to the influence of magnetism, and has been\r\nhardened into steel to form the sword and cutting tool. From the\r\ndelicate hair spring of a watch to the massive armor plate of a\r\nbattleship, it finds endless applications, and is nature’s most enduring\r\ngift to man--abundant, cheap, and lasting.\r\n\r\nMetallurgy is an ancient art, and the working of gold, silver and copper\r\ndates back to the beginning of history. Being found in a condition of\r\ncomparative purity, and needing but little refinement, they were, for\r\nthat reason, the first metals fashioned to meet the wants of man. Iron,\r\nsomewhat more refractory, appeared later, but it also has an early\r\nhistory, and is mentioned in the Old Testament of the Bible (Genesis\r\niv., 22), in which reference is made to Tubal Cain as an artificer in\r\nbrass and iron. The iron bedstead of Og, King of Bashan, is another\r\nreference. That it was known to the Egyptians and the Greeks at least\r\n1000 B. C., seems reasonably certain. The Assyrians were also acquainted\r\nwith iron, as is clearly established by the explorations of Mr. Layard,\r\nwhose contributions to the British Museum of iron articles from the\r\nruins of Ninevah include saws, picks, hammers, and knives of iron, which\r\nare believed to be of a date not later than 880 B. C.\r\n\r\nIron ore is usually found in the form of an oxide (hematite), and its\r\nreduction to the metallic form consists in displacing the oxygen, which\r\nis effected by mixing carbon in some form with the ore, and subjecting\r\nthe mixture to a high heat by means of a blast. The carbon unites with\r\nthe oxygen and forms carbonic acid gas, which escapes, while the\r\nmetallic iron fuses and runs out at the bottom of the furnace, and when\r\ncollected in trough-shaped moulds, is known as pig iron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 249.--PRIMITIVE IRON FURNACE OF HINDOSTAN.]\r\n\r\nThe first iron furnaces were known as _air bloomeries_, and had no\r\nforced draft. The first step of importance in iron making was the forced\r\nblast. An early form of blast furnace is shown in Fig. 249, which\r\nrepresents an iron furnace of the Kols, a tribe of iron smelters in\r\nLower Bengal and Orissa. An inclined tray terminates at its lower end in\r\na furnace inclosure. Charcoal in the furnace being well ignited, ore and\r\ncharcoal resting on the tray are alternately raked into the furnace. The\r\nblowers are two boxes, connected to the furnace by bamboo pipes, and\r\nprovided with skin covers, which are alternately depressed by the feet\r\nand raised by cords from the spring poles. Each skin cover has a hole in\r\nthe middle, which is stopped by the heel of the workman as the weight of\r\nthe person is thrown upon it, and is left open by the withdrawal of the\r\nfoot as the cover is raised. The heels of the workman, alternately\r\nraised, form alternately acting valves, and the skin cover, when\r\ndepressed, acts as a bellows. The fused metal sinks to a basin in the\r\nbottom of the furnace, and the slag or impurities run off above the\r\nlevel of the basin at the side of the furnace.\r\n\r\nThe great modern art of iron working dates from Lord Dudley’s British\r\npatent, No. 18, of 1621, which related to “The mistery, arte, way and\r\nmeanes of melting iron owre, and of makeing the same into cast workes or\r\nbarrs with seacoales or pittcoales in furnaces with bellowes of as good\r\ncondicon as hath bene heretofore made of charcoale.”\r\n\r\nThe next step of importance after the blast furnace was the substitution\r\nof coke for coal for the reduction of the ore, which was introduced by\r\nAbraham Darby, about 1750.\r\n\r\nNext came the conversion of cast iron into wrought iron. This was mainly\r\nthe work of Mr. Henry Cort, of Gosport, England, who, in 1783-84,\r\nintroduced the processes of puddling and rolling, which were two of the\r\nmost important inventions connected with the production of iron since\r\nthe employment of the blast furnace. Mr. Cort obtained British patents\r\nNo. 1,351, of 1783, and No. 1,420, of 1784, for his invention. His first\r\npatent related to the hammering, welding, and rolling of the iron, while\r\nin his second patent he introduced what is known as the reverberatory\r\nfurnace, having a concave bottom, into which the fluid metal is run from\r\nthe smelting furnace, and which is converted from brittle cast iron,\r\ncontaining a certain per cent. of carbon, into wrought iron, which has\r\nthe carbon eliminated, and is malleable and tough. This process is\r\ncalled _puddling_, and consists in exposing the molten metal to an\r\noxidizing current of flame and air. The metal boils as the carbon is\r\nburned out, and as it becomes more plastic and stiff it is collected\r\ninto what are called blooms, and these are hammered to get rid of the\r\nslag, and are reduced to marketable shape as wrought iron by the\r\nprocess described in his previous patent. Mr. Cort expended a fortune in\r\ndeveloping the iron trade, and was one of the greatest pioneers in this\r\nart.\r\n\r\nThe first notable development of the Nineteenth Century was the\r\nintroduction of the hot air blast in forges and furnaces where bellows\r\nor blowing apparatus was required. This was the invention of J. Beaumont\r\nNeilson, of Glasgow, and was covered by him in British patent No. 5,701\r\nof 1828. This consisted in heating the air blast before admitting it to\r\nthe furnace, and it so increased the reduction of refractory ores in the\r\nblast furnace as to permit three or four times the quantity of iron to\r\nbe produced with an expenditure of little more than one-third of the\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 250.--MODERN HOT BLAST FURNACE.]\r\n\r\nAn illustration of a modern blast furnace plant is given in Fig. 250. A\r\nis the furnace, in which the iron ore and fuel are arranged in alternate\r\nlayers. The hot air blast comes in through pipes _t_ at the bottom,\r\ncalled tuyeres. As gas escapes through the opening _b_ at the top, it is\r\nfirst cleared of dust in the settler and washer B, and then passes\r\nthrough the pipe C to the regenerators D D D, where it is made to heat\r\nthe incoming air. The gas mixed with some air burns in the\r\nregenerators, and, after heating a mass of brick within the regenerators\r\nred hot, escapes by the underground passageway to the chimney on the\r\nright. When the bricks are sufficiently hot in one of the regenerators,\r\ngas is turned off therefrom, and into another regenerator, and fresh air\r\nfrom pipe H is passed through the bricks of the heated regenerator, and\r\nbeing heated passes out pipe F at the top and thence to the pipe G and\r\ntuyeres _t_, to promote the chemical reactions in the blast furnace.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier blast furnaces a vast amount of heat was allowed to\r\nescape and was wasted. The utilization of this heat engaged the\r\nattention of Aubertot in France, 1810-14; Teague in England (British\r\npatent No. 6,211, of 1832); Budd (British patent No. 10,475, of 1845),\r\nand others. To enable the escaping hot gases to be employed for heating\r\nthe hot blast regenerators a charging device is now used, as seen at a\r\nin Fig. 250, in which the admission of ore and fuel is regulated by a\r\nlarge conical valve, and the gases are compelled to pass out at _b_ and\r\nbe utilized.\r\n\r\nAmong the world’s largest blast furnaces may be mentioned the Austrian\r\nAlpine Montan Gesellschaft, which concern owns thirty-two furnaces. This\r\nis said to be the largest number owned by any one concern in the world,\r\nbut most of them are of small size and run on charcoal iron. The\r\nfurnaces of the United States are, however, of the largest yield, and\r\nthe leading ones of these are:\r\n\r\n                                No.       Annual capacity\r\n                              Furnaces.       in tons.\r\n  Carnegie Steel Co.             17          2,200,000\r\n  Federal Steel Co.              19          1,900,000\r\n  Tennessee Coal and Iron Co.    20          1,307,000\r\n  National Steel Co.             12          1,205,000\r\n\r\nThe present annual output of pig iron in the United States is about ten\r\nmillion tons, of which these four companies make about one-half.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 251.--PUDDLING FURNACE.]\r\n\r\nWhen the iron runs from the bottom of the blast furnace it is allowed to\r\nflow into trough-like moulds in the sand of the floor, and forms pig\r\niron. Pig iron can be remelted and cast into various articles in moulds,\r\nbut it cannot be wrought with the hammer, nor rolled into rails or\r\nplates, nor welded on the anvil, because it is still a compound of iron\r\nand carbon with other impurities, and is crystalline in character. To\r\nbring it into wrought iron, which is malleable and ductile, it is\r\npuddled and refined, which involves chiefly the burning out of the\r\ncarbon and silicon. The pig iron is remelted (see Fig. 251) in the\r\ntray-shaped hearth _b_ from the heat of the fire in the reverberatory\r\nfurnace _a_, the reverberatory furnace being one in which the materials\r\ntreated are exposed to the heat of the flame, but not to contact with\r\nthe fuel. The hot flame mixed with air beating down upon the melted iron\r\non hearth _b_ for two hours or so, burns out the silicon and carbon, the\r\nprocess being facilitated by stirring and working the mass with tools.\r\nDuring the operation the oxygen of the air combines with the carbon and\r\nforms carbonic acid gas, which, in escaping from the metal, appears to\r\nmake it boil. When the iron parts with its carbon it loses its fluidity\r\nand becomes plastic and coherent, and is formed into balls called\r\n_blooms_. These blooms consist of particles of nearly pure iron\r\ncohering, but retaining still a quantity of slag or vitreous material,\r\nand other impurities, which slag, etc., is worked out while still, hot\r\nby a squeezing, kneading, and hammering process to form wrought iron\r\nthat may be worked into any shape between rolls or under the hammer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 252.--BESSEMER CONVERTER DURING THE “BLOW.”]\r\n\r\n_Bessemer Steel._--Steel is a compound of iron and carbon, standing\r\nbetween wrought iron and cast iron. Wrought iron has, when pure,\r\npractically no carbon in it, while cast iron has a considerable\r\nproportion in excess of steel. Steel making consists mainly in so\r\ntreating cast iron as to get rid of a part of the carbon and other\r\nimpurities. Of all methods of steel making, and in fact of all the steps\r\nof progress in the art of metal working, none has been so important and\r\nso far reaching in effect as the Bessemer process: It was invented by\r\nHenry Bessemer, of England, in 1855. About fifty British patents were\r\ntaken by Mr. Bessemer relating to various improvements in the iron\r\nindustry, but those representing the pioneer steps of the so-called\r\nBessemer process are No. 2,321, of 1855; No. 2,768, of 1855, and No.\r\n356, of 1856. The process is illustrated in Figs. 252, 253 and 254. The\r\nconverter in which the process is carried out is a great bottle-shaped\r\nvessel 15 feet high and 9 feet wide, consisting of an iron shell with a\r\nheavy lining of refractory material, capable of holding eight or more\r\ntons of melted iron, and with an open neck at the top turned to one\r\nside. It is mounted on trunnions, and is provided with gear wheels by\r\nwhich it may be turned on its trunnions, so that it may be maintained\r\nerect, as in Fig. 252, or be turned down to pour out the contents into\r\nthe casting ladle, as in Figs. 253 and 254. At the bottom of the\r\nconverter there is an air chamber supplied by a pipe leading from one of\r\nthe trunnions, which is hollow, and a number of upwardly discharging air\r\nopenings or nozzles send streams of air into the molten mass of red hot\r\ncast iron. The red hot cast iron contains more or less carbon and\r\nsilicon, and the air uniting with the carbon and silicon burns it out,\r\nand in doing so furnishes the heat for the continuance of the operation.\r\nWhen the pressure of air is turned into the mass of molten iron a tongue\r\nof flame increasing in brilliancy to an intense white, comes roaring out\r\nof the mouth of the converter, and a violent ebullition takes place\r\nwithin, and throws sparks and spatters of metal high in the air around,\r\nproducing the impression and scenic effect of a volcano in eruption. In\r\nfifteen minutes the volume and brilliancy of the flame diminish, and\r\nthis indicates the critical moment of conversion into tough steel, which\r\nmust be adjusted to the greatest nicety. When the carbon is sufficiently\r\nburned out the blast is stopped and the converter turned down to receive\r\na quantity of ferro-manganese or spiegeleisen (a compound of iron\r\ncontaining manganese), which unites with and removes the sulphur and\r\noxide of iron, and then the lurid monster, with its breath of fire\r\nabated, and its energy exhausted, bows its head and vomits forth its\r\ncharge of boiling steel, to be wrought or cast into ten thousand useful\r\narticles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 253.--POURING THE MOLTEN METAL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 254.--SIDE VIEW, SHOWING TURNING GEARS.]\r\n\r\nLike most all valuable inventions, Mr. Bessemer’s claim to priority for\r\nthe invention was contested. An American inventor, William Kelly, in an\r\ninterference with Mr. Bessemer’s United States patent, successfully\r\nestablished a claim to the broad idea of forcing air into the red hot\r\ncast iron, and United States patent No. 17,628, June 23, 1857, was\r\ngranted to Mr. Kelly. The honor of inventing and introducing a\r\nsuccessful process and apparatus for making steel by this method,\r\nhowever, fairly belongs to Mr. Bessemer, to whose work was to be added\r\nthe valuable contribution of Robert F. Mushet (British patent No. 2,219,\r\nof 1856) of adding spiegeleisen, a triple compound of iron, carbon and\r\nmanganese, to the charge in the converter. This step served to regulate\r\nthe supply of carbon and eliminate the oxygen, and completed the process\r\nof making steel. The Holly converter, covered by United States patents\r\nNo. 86,303, and No. 86,304, January 26, 1869, represented one of the\r\nmost important American developments of the Bessemer converter.\r\n\r\nThe importance of Bessemer steel in its influence upon modern\r\ncivilization is everywhere admitted. It has so cheapened steel that it\r\nnow competes with iron in price. Practically all railroad rails, iron\r\ngirders and beams for buildings, nails, etc., are made from it at a cost\r\nof between one and two cents per pound.\r\n\r\nIn recognition of the great benefits conferred upon humanity by this\r\nprocess, Queen Victoria conferred the degree of knighthood upon the\r\ninventor, and his fortune resulting from his invention is estimated to\r\nhave grown for some time at the rate of $500,000 a year. In a historical\r\nsketch of the development of his process, delivered by Sir Henry\r\nBessemer in December, 1896, before the American Society of Mechanical\r\nEngineers at New York, Mr. Bessemer was reported as saying that the\r\nannual production of Bessemer steel in Europe and America amounted to\r\n10,000,000 tons. The production of Bessemer steel in the United States\r\nfor 1897 was for ingots and castings 5,475,315 tons, and for railroad\r\nrails 1,644,520 tons. The extent to which steel has displaced iron is\r\nshown by the fact that in the same year iron rails to the extent of\r\n2,872 tons only were made, as compared with more than a million and a\r\nhalf tons of Bessemer steel.\r\n\r\nIn the popular vote taken by the _Scientific American_, July 25, 1896,\r\nas to what invention introduced in the past fifty years had conferred\r\nthe greatest benefit upon mankind, Bessemer steel was given the place of\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\nA recent improvement in the handling of iron from the blast furnace is\r\nshown in Fig. 255. Heretofore, the iron was run in open sand moulds on\r\nthe floor and allowed to cool in bars called “pigs,” which were united\r\nin a series to a main body of the flow, called a “sow.” To break the\r\n“pigs” from the “sow,” and handle the iron in transportation, was a very\r\nlaborious and expensive work. The illustration shows two series of\r\nparallel trough moulds, each forming an endless belt, running on wheels.\r\nThe molten cast iron is poured direct into these moulds, and as they\r\ntravel along they pass beneath a body of water, which cools and\r\nsolidifies the iron into pigs, and then carries them up an incline and\r\ndumps them directly into the cars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 255.--CASTING AND LOADING PIG IRON.]\r\n\r\n_Open Hearth Steel_ is not so cheap as Bessemer steel, but it is of a\r\nfiner and more uniform quality. Bessemer steel is made in a few minutes\r\nby the most energetic, rapid and critical of processes, while the open\r\nhearth steel requires several hours, and its development being thus\r\nprolonged it may be watched and regulated to a greater nicety of result.\r\nFor railroad rails and architectural construction Bessemer steel still\r\nfinds a great field of usefulness, but for the finest quality of steel,\r\nsuch as is employed in making steam boilers, tools, armor plate for war\r\nvessels, etc., steel made by the open hearth process is preferred. It\r\nconsists in the decarburization of cast iron by fusion with wrought\r\niron, iron sponge, steel scrap, or iron oxide, in the hearth of a\r\nreverberatory furnace heated with gases, the flame of which assists the\r\nreaction, and the subsequent recarburization or deoxidation of the bath\r\nby the addition, at the close of the process, of spiegeleisen or\r\nferro-manganese. The period of fusion lasts from four to eight hours.\r\nThe advantages over the Bessemer process are, a less expensive plant and\r\nthe greater duration of the operation, permitting, by means of\r\nsampling, more complete control of the quality of the product and\r\ngreater uniformity of result.\r\n\r\nThe British patents of Siemens, No. 2,861, of 1856; No. 167, of 1861,\r\nand No. 972, of 1863, for regenerative furnaces, and the British patents\r\nof Emile and Pierre Martin, No. 2,031, of 1864; No. 2,137, of 1865, and\r\nNo. 859, of 1866, represent the so-called _Siemens-Martin_ process,\r\nwhich is the best known and generally used open hearth process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 256.--SIEMENS REGENERATIVE FURNACE.]\r\n\r\n_The Siemens Regenerative Furnace_, in which this process is carried\r\nout, is seen in Fig. 256. Four chambers, C, E, E′, C′, are filled with\r\nfire brick loosely stacked with spaces between, in checker-work style.\r\nGas is forced in the bottom of chamber C, and air in bottom of chamber\r\nE, and they pass up separate flues, G, on the left, and being ignited in\r\nchamber D above, impinge in a flame on the metal in hearth H, the hot\r\ngases passing out flues F on the right, and percolating through and\r\nhighly heating the checker-work bricks in chambers E′ and C′. As soon as\r\nthese are hot, gas and air are shut off by valves from chambers C and E,\r\nand gas and air admitted to the bottoms of the now hot chambers C′ and\r\nE′. The gas and air now passing up through these chambers C′, E′, become\r\nhighly heated, and when burned above the melted iron on hearth H produce\r\nan intense heat. The waste gases now pass down flues G, and impart\r\ntheir heat to the checker-work bricks in chambers C and E. When the\r\nbricks in E′ C′ become cooled by the passage of gas and air, the valves\r\nare again adjusted to reverse the currents of gas and air, sending them\r\nnow through chambers C and E again. In this way the heat escaping to\r\nthe smoke stack is stored up in the bricks and utilized to heat the\r\nincoming fuel gases before burning them, thus greatly increasing the\r\neffective energy of the furnace, saving fuel, and keeping the smoke\r\nstack relatively cool.\r\n\r\n_Armor Plate._--In these late days of struggle for supremacy between the\r\npower of the projectile and the resistance of the battleship, the\r\nproduction of armor plate has become an interesting and important\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThree methods are employed. One is to roll the massive ingots directly\r\ninto plates between tremendous rolls, a single pair of which, such as\r\nused in the Krupp works, are said to weigh in the rough as much as\r\n100,000 pounds. Usually there are three great rollers arranged one above\r\nthe other, and automatic tables are provided for raising and lowering\r\nthe plates in their passage from one set of rolls to the other. The man\r\nin charge uses a whistle in giving the signals which direct these\r\nmovements, and without the help of tongs and levers the glowing blocks\r\nmove easily back and forth between the rollers. The men standing on both\r\nsides of the rollers have only to wipe off the plates with brooms and\r\noccasionally turn the plates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 257.--14,000-TON HYDRAULIC PRESS FORGING AN ARMOR\r\nPLATE.]\r\n\r\nThe second method utilizes great steam hammers weighing 125 tons, and\r\nstriking Titanic blows upon the yielding metal. The most modern method,\r\nhowever, is by the hydraulic press forge, now used in the shops of the\r\nBethlehem steel works in the production of Harveyized armor plate. In\r\nFig. 257 is seen the great 14,000-ton hydraulic press-forge squeezing\r\ninto shape a port armor plate for the battleship “Alabama.” After\r\nleaving the forge, the plate is trimmed to shape by the savage bite of a\r\nrotary saw and planer, seen in Figs. 258 and 259, whose insatiable\r\nappetites tear off the steel like famished fiends. The plate is then\r\ntaken to be Harveyized by cementation, hardening, and tempering, as seen\r\nin Figs. 260, 261, and 262. The 125-ton mass of metal representing the\r\nplate in the rough, and weighing more than a locomotive, is thus handled\r\nand brought to shape with an ease and dispatch that inspires the\r\nobserver with mixed emotions of admiration and awe.\r\n\r\n_Making Horse Shoes._--Anthony’s patent, April 8, 1831; Tolles’, of\r\nOctober 24, 1834, and H. Burden’s, of November 23, 1835, were pioneers\r\nin horse-shoe machines. Mr. Burden took many subsequent patents, and to\r\nhim more than any other inventor belongs the credit of introducing\r\nmachine-made horse shoes, which greatly cheapened the cost of this\r\nhomely, but useful article. Nearly 400 United States patents have been\r\ngranted for horse-shoe machines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 258.--ROTARY SAW, CUTTING HEAVY ARMOR PLATE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 259.--ROTARY PLANER, TRIMMING HEAVY ARMOR PLATE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 260.--THE CEMENTATION FURNACE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 261.--HARDENING THE PLATE BY JETS OF WATER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 262.--OIL TEMPERING.]\r\n\r\n_Making Screws, Bolts, Nuts, Etc._--Screw-making according to modern\r\nmethods began between 1800-1810 with the operations of Maudsley. Sloan,\r\nin 1851, and Harvey, in 1864, made many improvements in machines,\r\noperating upon screw blanks. The gimlet-pointed screw, which allows the\r\nscrew to be turned into wood without having a hole bored for it, was an\r\nimportant advance in the art. It was the invention of Thomas J. Sloan,\r\npatented August 20, 1846, No. 4,704, and was twice re-issued and\r\nextended. In later years the rolling of screws, instead of cutting the\r\nthreads by a chasing tool, has attained considerable importance, and\r\nprovides a simpler and cheaper method of manufacture. Knowles’ United\r\nStates patent of April 1, 1831, re-issued March 1, 1833, described such\r\na process, while Rogers, in patents No. 370,354, September 20, 1887; No.\r\n408,529, August 6, 1889; No. 430,237, June 17, 1890, and No. 434,809,\r\nAugust 19, 1890, added such improvement in the process as to make it\r\npractical.\r\n\r\nIn the great art of metal working the names of Bramah, Whitworth,\r\nClements and Sellers appear conspicuously in the early part of the\r\ncentury as inventors of planing, boring and turning machinery for\r\nmetals. Our present splendid machine shops, gun shops, locomotive works,\r\ntypewriter and bicycle factories, are examples of the wonderful\r\nextensions of this art. In later years the field has been filled so full\r\nof improvements and special machines for special work, that only a brief\r\ncitation of a few representative types is possible, and even then\r\nselection becomes a very difficult task. Many special tools,\r\nparticularly those designed for _bicycle work_, have been devised, as\r\nexhibited by patent to Hillman, August 11, 1891, No. 457,718. In\r\n_turning car wheels_, an improvement consists in bringing the wheel to\r\nbe dressed into close proximity to the edge of a rapidly revolving\r\nsmooth metal disk, whereby the surface of the wheel is melted away\r\nwithout there being any actual contact between the wheel surface and the\r\ndisk. This is shown in patent to Miltimore, August 24, 1886, No.\r\n347,951. In _metal tube manufacture_ three processes are worthy of\r\nmention: (1) Passing a heated solid rod endwise between the working\r\nfaces of two rapidly rotating tapered rolls, set with their axes at an\r\nangle to each other, as shown in Mannesmann’s patent, April 26, 1887,\r\nNo. 361,954 and 361,955. (2) Forcing a tube into a rapidly rotating die,\r\nwhereby the friction softens the tube, and the pressure and rotation of\r\nthe die spin it into a tube of reduced diameter, shown in patent to\r\nBevington, January 13, 1891, No. 444,721. (3) Placing a hot ingot in a\r\ndie and forcing a mandrel through the ingot, thereby causing it to\r\nassume the shape of the interior of the die, and greatly condensing the\r\nmetal, shown in patents to Robertson, November 26, 1889, No. 416,014,\r\nand Ehrhardt, April 11, 1893, No. 495,245.\r\n\r\nIn _welding_, the employment of electricity constitutes the most\r\nimportant departure. This was introduced by Elihu Thomson, and is\r\ncovered in his patents Nos. 347,140 to 347,142, August 10, 1886, and No.\r\n501,546, July 18, 1893. In _annealing_ and _tempering_, electricity has\r\nalso been employed as a means of heating (see patent to Shaw, No.\r\n211,938, February 4, 1879). It supplies an even heat and uniform\r\ntemperature, and is much used in producing clock and watch springs. The\r\nmaking of iron castings malleable by a prolonged baking in a furnace in\r\na bed of metallic oxide was an important, but early, step. It was the\r\ninvention of Samuel Lucas, and is disclosed in his British patent No.\r\n2,767, of 1804.\r\n\r\nThe _Harvey process_ of making armor plate is an important recent\r\ndevelopment in _cementation_ and _case hardening_, and is covered by his\r\nUnited States patents No. 376,194, January 10, 1888, and No. 460,262,\r\nSeptember 29, 1891. It consists, see Fig. 260, in embedding the face of\r\nthe plate in carbon, protecting the back and sides with sand, heating to\r\nabout the melting point of cast iron, and subsequently hardening the\r\nface. The Krupp armor plate, now rated as the best, is made under the\r\npatent to Schmitz and Ehrenzberger, No. 534,178, February 12, 1895.\r\n\r\nIn _coating with metals_, the so-called “galvanizing” of iron is an\r\nimportant art. This was introduced by Craufurd (British patent No.\r\n7,355, of April 29, 1837), and consisted in plunging the iron into a\r\nbath of melted zinc covered with sal ammoniac. In more recent years the\r\ntinning of iron has become an important industry, and machines have been\r\nmade for automatically coating the plates and dispensing with hand\r\nlabor, examples of which are found in patents No. 220,768, October 21,\r\n1879, Morewood; No. 329,240, October 27, 1885, Taylor, _et al._, and No.\r\n426,962, April 29, 1890, Rogers and Player.\r\n\r\nIn _metal founding_ the employment of chill moulds is an important step.\r\nWhere any portion of a casting is subjected to unusual wear, the mould\r\nis formed, opposite that part of the casting, out of metal, instead of\r\nsand, and this metal surface, by rapidly extracting the heat at that\r\npoint by virtue of its own conductivity, hardens the metal of the\r\ncasting at such point. The casting of car wheels by chill moulds, by\r\nwhich the tread portion of the wheel was hardened and increased in\r\nwearing qualities, is a good illustration. Important types are found in\r\npatents to Wilmington, No. 85,046, December 15, 1868; Barr, No. 207,794,\r\nSeptember 10, 1878, and Whitney, re-issue patent, No. 10,804, February\r\n1, 1887.\r\n\r\nIn _wire-working_ great advances have been made in machines for making\r\n_barbed wire fences_. The French patent to Grassin & Baledans, in 1861,\r\nis the first disclosure of a barbed wire fence. This art began\r\npractically, however, with the United States patent to Glidden and\r\nVaughan for a barbed wire machine, No. 157,508, December 8, 1874,\r\nre-issued March 20, 1877, No. 7,566, and has assumed great proportions.\r\nA machine for making wire net is shown in patent to Scarles, No.\r\n380,664, April 3, 1888, and wire picket fence machines are shown in\r\npatents to Fultz, No. 298,368, May 13, 1884, and Kitselman, No. 356,322,\r\nJanuary 18, 1887. Machines for making wire nails were invented at an\r\nearly period, but the product found but little favor until about 1880,\r\nwhen they began to be extensively used, and have almost entirely\r\nsupplanted cut nails for certain classes of work, since their round\r\ncross section and lack of taper give great holding power and avoid\r\ncutting the grain of the wood. In 1897 the wire nails produced in the\r\nUnited States amounted to 8,997,245 kegs of 100 pounds each, which\r\nnearly doubled the output of 1896. The output of cut nails for the same\r\nyear was 2,106,799 kegs.\r\n\r\nThe bending of wire to form chains without welding the links has long\r\nbeen done for watch chains, etc., but in late years the method has\r\nextended to many varieties of heavy chains. The patents to Breul, No.\r\n359,054, March 8, 1887, and No. 467,331, January 19, 1892, are good\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nAn interesting class of machines, but one impossible of illustration on\r\naccount of their complication, are machines for making pins. In earlier\r\ntimes pins had their heads applied in a separate operation. Making pins\r\nfrom wire and forming the heads out of the cut sections began in the\r\nNineteenth Century with Hunt’s British patent No. 4,129, of 1817. This\r\nart received its greatest impetus, however, under Wright’s British\r\npatent No. 4,955, of 1824. A paper of pins containing a pin for every\r\nday in the year, and costing but a few cents, gives no idea to the\r\npurchaser of the time, thought and capital expended in machines for\r\nmaking them, and yet were it not for such machines, rapidly cutting\r\ncoils of wire into lengths, pointing and heading the pins, and sticking\r\nthem into papers, the world would be deprived of one of its most\r\nubiquitous and useful articles. Many tons of pins are made in the United\r\nStates weekly, and it is said that 20,000,000 pins a day are required to\r\nmeet the demand.\r\n\r\nIn the metal working art the making of firearms and projectiles has\r\ngrown to wonderful proportions. Cutlery and builders’ hardware is an\r\nenormous branch; wire-drawing, sheet metal-making, forging, and the\r\nmaking of tools, springs, tin cans, needles, hooks and eyes, nails and\r\ntacks, and a thousand minor articles, have grown to such proportions\r\nthat only a bird’s-eye view of the art is possible.\r\n\r\nIn the _making_ of _shot_, the old method was to pour the melted metal\r\nthrough a sieve, and allow it to drop from a tower 180 feet or more in\r\nheight. David Smith’s patent, No. 6,460, May 22, 1849, provided an\r\nascending current of air through which the metal dropped, and which, by\r\ncooling the shot by retarding its fall and bringing a greater number of\r\nair particles in contact with them, avoided the necessity of such high\r\ntowers. In 1868, Glasgow and Wood patented a process of dropping the\r\nshot through a column of glycerine or oil. Still another method is to\r\nallow the melted metal to fall on a revolving disk, which divides it\r\ninto drops by centrifugal action.\r\n\r\n_Alloys._--Over 300 United States patents have been granted for various\r\nalloys of metals. The so-called _babbit metal_ was patented in the\r\nUnited States by Isaac Babbit, July 17, 1839, and in England, May 15,\r\n1843, No. 9,724. This consists of an antifriction compound of tin, 10\r\nparts, copper, 1 part, and antimony, 1 part, and is specially adapted\r\nfor the lubricated bearings of machinery. _Phosphor bronze_, introduced\r\nin 1871, combines 80 to 92 parts copper, 7 of tin, and 1 of phosphorus\r\n(see United States patents to Lavroff, No. 118,372, August 22, 1871, and\r\nLevi and Kunzel, No. 115,220, May 23, 1871). The addition of phosphorus\r\npromotes the fluidity of the metal and makes very clean, fine and strong\r\ncastings. In alloys of iron, _chromium steel_ is covered by patents to\r\nBaur, No. 49,495, August 22, 1865; No. 99,624, February 8, 1870, and\r\nNo. 123,443, February 6, 1872; _manganese steel_, by Hadfield’s patent,\r\nNo. 303,150, August 5, 1884; _aluminum steel_, by Wittenström’s patent,\r\nNo. 333,373, December 29, 1885, and _phosphorus steel_, by Kunkel’s\r\npatent, No. 182,371, September 19, 1876. The most recent and perhaps\r\nmost important, however, is _nickel steel_, used in making armor for\r\nbattleships. This is covered by Schneider’s patents, Nos. 415,655, and\r\n415,657, November 19, 1889.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 England led the world in the iron industry with a production of\r\n6,381,051 tons of pig iron, as compared with 2,301,215 tons by the\r\nUnited States. In 1897 the United States leads the world in the\r\nfollowing ratios:\r\n\r\n                     Tons Pig Iron.   Tons Steel.\r\n  United States        9,652,680       7,156,957\r\n  Great Britain        8,789,455       4,585,961\r\n  Germany              6,879,541       4,796,226\r\n  France               2,472,143       1,312,000\r\n\r\nThe United States made in that year 29.30 per cent. of the world’s\r\nproduction of pig iron, and 34.58 per cent. of its steel. The total\r\noutput of the whole world in that year was 32,937,490 tons pig iron, and\r\n20,696,787 tons of steel.\r\n\r\n_Metallurgy of Rarer Metals._--Although less in evidence than iron, this\r\nhas engaged the attention of the scientist from the earliest years of\r\nthe century. The full list of metals discovered since 1800 may be found\r\nunder “Chemistry.” The more important only are here given. Palladium and\r\nrhodium were reduced by Wollaston in 1804. Potassium and sodium were\r\nfirst separated in metallic form by Sir Humphrey Davy in 1807, through\r\nthe agency of the voltaic arc; barium, strontium, calcium and boron by\r\nthe same scientist in 1808; iodine by Courtois in 1811; selenium by\r\nBerzelius in 1817; cadmium by Stromeyer in 1817; silicon by Berzelius in\r\n1823, and bromium by Balard in 1826. Magnesium was first prepared by\r\nBussey in 1829. Aluminum was first separated in 1828 by Wohler, by\r\ndecomposing the chloride by means of potassium. Oersted, in 1827,\r\npreceded him with important preliminary steps, and Deville, in 1854,\r\nfollowed in the first commercial applications. In late years the\r\nmetallurgy of aluminum has made great advances. The Cowles process heats\r\nto incandescence by the electric current a mixture of alumina, carbon\r\nand copper, the reduced aluminum alloying with the copper. This process\r\nis covered by United States patents to Cowles and Cowles, No. 319,795,\r\nJune 9. 1885, and Nos. 324,658 and 324,659, August 18, 1885. It has,\r\nhowever, for the most parts been superseded by the process patented by\r\nHall, April 2, 1889, No. 400,766, in which alumina dissolved in fused\r\ncryolite is electrically decomposed.\r\n\r\nIn the metallurgy of the precious metals probably the most important\r\nstep has been the _cyanide process_ of obtaining gold and silver. In\r\n1806 it was known that gold was soluble in a solution of cyanide of\r\npotassium. In 1844 L. Elsner published investigations along this line,\r\nand demonstrated that the solution took place only in the presence of\r\noxygen. McArthur and Forrest perfected the process for commercial\r\napplication, and it is now extensively used in the Transvaal and\r\nelsewhere. It is covered by their British patent, No. 14,174, of 1887,\r\nand United States patents No. 403,202, May 14, 1889, and No. 418,137,\r\nDecember 24, 1889, which describe the application of dilute solutions of\r\ncyanide of potassium, not exceeding 8 parts cyanogen to 1,000 parts of\r\nwater: the use of zinc in a fine state of division to precipitate the\r\ngold out of solution, and the preparatory treatment of the partially\r\noxidized ores with an alkali or salts of an alkali. By this\r\nsolution-process gold, in the finest state of subdivision, which could\r\nnot be extracted by other processes from the earthy matters, may be\r\nrecovered and saved in a simple, practical and cheap way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 263.--EDISON MAGNETIC CONCENTRATING WORKS. THE GIANT\r\nCRUSHING ROLLS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 264.--EDISON MAGNETIC CONCENTRATOR.]\r\n\r\nIn the working of ores of gold and silver the old method of comminution\r\nof the rock and the separation of the gold and silver by amalgamation\r\nwith mercury has given birth to thousands of inventions in stamp mills,\r\namalgamators, ore washers, concentrators and separators. In the\r\ntreatment of iron ores, and especially those of low grade, the magnetic\r\nconcentrator is an interesting and striking departure. This method goes\r\nback to the first half of the Nineteenth Century, an example being found\r\nin the patent to Cook, No. 6,121, February 20, 1849. Edison’s patent,\r\nNo. 228,329, June 1, 1880, is however, the basis of the first practical\r\noperations in which magnets, operating by attraction upon falling\r\nparticles of iron ore, are made to separate the particles rich in iron\r\nfrom the sand. In Fig. 263 is shown the Edison magnetic concentrating\r\napparatus. The ore, in masses of all sizes up to boulders of five or six\r\ntons weight, is dumped between the giant rolls, and these enormous\r\nmasses are crunched and comminuted more easily than a dog crunches a\r\nbone. These gigantic rolls are six feet in diameter, six feet long, and\r\ntheir surfaces are covered with crushing knobs. They weigh with the\r\nmoving machinery seventy tons, and when revolved at a circumferential\r\nspeed of 3,500 feet in a minute, their insatiable and irresistible bite\r\nsoon chews the rock into fragments that pass into similar crushing rolls\r\nset closer together until reduced to the desired fineness. The sand is\r\nthen raised to the top of the concentrating devices, shown in Fig. 264,\r\nand is allowed to fall in sheets from inclined boards in front of a\r\nseries of magnets, of which four sets are shown in the figure. These\r\nmagnets deflect the fall of the particles rich in iron (which are\r\nattracted), while the non-magnetic particles of sand drop straight down.\r\nA thin knife-edge partition board, arranged below the falling sheets of\r\nsand, separates the deflected magnetic particles from the\r\nstraight-falling sand. These magnetic particles are then collected and\r\npressed into little bricks, which are now so rich in iron, by virtue of\r\nconcentration, as to make the final reduction of the iron in the blast\r\nfurnace easy and profitable. More recent developments in this art are\r\nshown in patents to Wetherill, No. 555,792, March 3, 1896, and Payne,\r\nNo. 641,148, January 9, 1900.\r\n\r\nIn the production of copper the well-known Bessemer process for refining\r\niron is now largely used, as shown in patent to Manhes, No. 456,516,\r\nJuly 21, 1891, in which blasts of air are forced through the melted\r\ncopper to remove sulphur and other impurities. Electrolytic processes of\r\nrefining copper are also largely used, as described in Farmer’s patent,\r\nNo. 322,170, July 14, 1885.\r\n\r\nThe production of metals, other than iron, in the United States for the\r\nyear 1897, was as follows:\r\n\r\n  Gold, 2,774,935 ounces; worth $57,363,000.\r\n  Silver, 53,860,000 ounces; worth $32,316,000.\r\n  Copper, 220,571 long tons.\r\n  Lead, 212,000 short tons.\r\n  Zinc, 99,980 short tons.\r\n  Aluminum, 4,000,000 lbs.; worth (37½ cents lb.) $1,500,000.\r\n  (This was three times the product of 1896.)\r\n  Mercury, 26,691 flasks; worth $993,445.\r\n  Nickel, 23,707 pounds; worth (33 cents pound) $7,823.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nFIREARMS AND EXPLOSIVES.\r\n\r\n    THE CANNON THE MOST ANCIENT OF FIREARMS--MUZZLE AND BREECH LOADERS\r\n    OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY--THE ARMSTRONG GUN--THE RODMAN, DAHLGREN\r\n    AND PARROTT GUNS--BREECH LOADING ORDNANCE--RAPID FIRE BREECH LOADING\r\n    RIFLES--DISAPPEARING GUN--GATLING GUN--DYNAMITE GUN--THE COLT AND\r\n    SMITH & WESSON REVOLVERS--GERMAN AUTOMATIC PISTOL--BREECH LOADING\r\n    SMALL ARMS--MAGAZINE GUNS--THE LEE, KRAG-JORGENSEN, AND MAUSER\r\n    RIFLES--HAMMERLESS GUNS--REBOUNDING LOCKS--GUN COTTON--NITRO-\r\n    GLYCERINE AND SMOKELESS POWDER--MINES AND TORPEDOES.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrange as it may appear, the evolution of an enlightened civilization\r\nand the deadly use of firearms have developed in parallel lines. What\r\nrelation there may be between the adoption of the teachings of Christ to\r\nmen to love one another, and the invention of increased facilities among\r\nmen for killing one another, is a problem for the philosopher. Is it\r\nbecause killing at long range is less brutal, or does the deterrent\r\ninfluence of this increased facility operate as a check appealing to the\r\nfear of the individual, or is the cannon one of God’s missionaries in\r\nworking out the great law of the survival of the fittest? Whatever it\r\nmay be, there does seem to be some relation of cause and effect between\r\nthe two factors, and doubtless all three of the causes have exercised a\r\ncontributory influence. In the olden days the wage of battle was almost\r\nuniversally decided by the strength of brawn, and the higher qualities\r\nof mind were subservient. The advent of firearms has changed all this.\r\nIt has made the weakest arm equal to the strongest when supported by the\r\nsame or a superior mental equipment, and this has made a great step\r\ntoward the supremacy of the intellectual against the attack of the\r\nphysically strong. In the fifth century the great civilization of Rome\r\nfell under the ruthless attack of the northern barbarian. Could such a\r\nthing have been possible with the gates defended by Gatling guns,\r\nmagazine rifles, and dynamite shells? On the contrary, we find to-day a\r\nhandful of trained soldiers equipped with modern firearms putting to\r\nflight a horde of ignorant savages. The history of modern wars is filled\r\nwith illustrations of the shifting of the contest among men from an\r\nissue of brute force to a contest of brains, and of the support rendered\r\nthe latter by firearms. But is war really necessary, and may we not\r\nhope that it shall cease? We can only say that the ideal sentiment of\r\nbeating the sword into the plowshare is as yet the dream of the\r\noptimist, for man has gone right along in perfecting the arts of war and\r\nraising the execution of firearms to such a deadly efficacy, that the\r\nNineteenth Century in a paramount degree has been conspicuously notable\r\nfor its advances in this art. Invention after invention has followed in\r\nsuch rapid succession, even to the last years of the Nineteenth Century,\r\nuntil war now assumes the conditions of suicide and annihilation.\r\n\r\nNo coherent history of firearms and explosives is possible in any short\r\nreview. The cannon, bombard or mortar, musket, pistol and petard, all\r\nbelong to former centuries, and in one form or another extend back to\r\nthe most ancient times, but they have grown in the Nineteenth Century\r\ninto such accuracy and distance of range, into such rapidity of action,\r\ninto such multiplied efficiency in repeating systems, into such energy\r\nof explosives, and such convenient embodiment and penetration of\r\nprojectile, that these subjects must needs be considered in separate\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 265.--MUZZLE LOADING CANNON OF THE SIXTEENTH\r\nCENTURY.]\r\n\r\n_The Cannon_ is the most ancient of all firearms, and, like gunpowder,\r\nis believed to have had its origin with the Chinese. In the Eleventh\r\nCentury the vessels of the King of Tunis, in the attack on Seville, are\r\nsaid to have had on board iron pipes from which a thundering fire was\r\ndischarged. Condé, in his history of the Moors in Spain, speaks of them\r\nas used in that country as early as 1118. Ferdinand, in 1309, took\r\nGibraltar from the Moors by cannon, and in 1346 the English used them at\r\nthe battle of Crécy, and from that time on they became a common weapon\r\nof warfare. In the first cannon used the balls were of stone, and some\r\nof them were of enormous size. The bronze cannon of Mohammed II., A.\r\nD., 1464, had a bore of 25 inches, and threw a stone ball of 800 pounds.\r\nThe _Tsar-Pooschka_, the great bronze gun of Moscow, cast in 1586, was\r\neven larger, and had a bore 36 inches in diameter. Early in the history\r\nof the cannon the breech-loading feature was introduced. In Figs. 265\r\nand 266 are shown illustrations from the Sixteenth Century, Fig. 265\r\nrepresenting a muzzle loader, and Fig. 266 a breech-loader.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 266.--BREECH LOADING CANNON OF THE SIXTEENTH\r\nCENTURY.]\r\n\r\nPassing through various stages of development, the cannon came down to\r\nthe Nineteenth Century, and was known generally as ordnance or\r\nartillery, and specifically as cannon or heavy guns, mortars for\r\nthrowing shell at a great elevation, and howitzers for field, mountain,\r\nor siege, and which latter are lighter and shorter than cannon, and\r\ndesigned to throw hollow projectiles with comparatively small charges.\r\nThe feature of importance in the cannon which contributed most to its\r\nefficiency was the rifling of the bore with spiral grooves. This, by\r\ngiving a rotating effect to the projectile, caused it to maintain a\r\ntruer flight by taking advantage of the law of physics that a rotating\r\nbody tends to preserve its plane of rotation. The rifling of the barrels\r\nof firearms is, however, of very ancient origin. The British patent to\r\nRotsipen, No. 71, of 1635, is an early disclosure of this art. The\r\npatent was granted him for\r\n\r\n    “Fourteen yeares if he live soe long.” *  *  * “To draw or to shave\r\n    barrells for pieces of all sortes straight even and smooth, and to\r\n    make anie crooked barrell perfectly straight with greate ease, and\r\n    to _rifle cutt out_ or screwe barrells as wyde or as close or as\r\n    deepe or as shallowe as shalbe required, with greate ease.”\r\n\r\nThe rifle grooves, however, were first made spiral or “screwed” by\r\nKoster, of Birmingham, about 1620, while straight grooves are said to\r\nhave been in use as far back as 1498. In Berlin there is a rifled cannon\r\nof 1664 with thirteen grooves. Rifled cannon were first employed in\r\nactual service in Louis Napoleon’s Italian campaign of 1859, and were\r\nfirst introduced in the United States service by General James in 1861.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the Nineteenth Century a great impetus was given to\r\nthe development of artillery by the Crimean War, followed by the Civil\r\nWar of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn England the Armstrong gun was introduced about 1855, and was covered\r\nby British patents No. 401, of 1857; No. 2,564, of 1858; No. 611, of\r\n1859, and No. 743, of 1861. This originally consisted of an internal\r\ntube of wrought iron or gun metal, with cylindrical casings of wrought\r\niron shrunk on. It was afterwards improved in what was known as the\r\nFraser gun. In Germany the operations of Krupp as a gun maker began to\r\nbe notable about this period. In the United States, Colonel Rodman\r\ndevised a means of casting guns of large calibre, by having a hollow\r\ncore through which water was circulated to rapidly cool and harden the\r\nmetal in the vicinity of the bore, and to relieve the unequal strain in\r\ncooling. He obtained patent No. 5,236, August 14, 1847, for the same.\r\nThe Dahlgren gun was patented August 6, 1861, Nos. 32,983, 32,984, and\r\n32,985, by Admiral Dahlgren, U. S. N. The improvement covered the\r\nadjustment of the thickness of the metal at the breech of the gun to the\r\nvarying pressure strains along the bore. These guns were distinguishable\r\nby the smooth bulbous breech of great thickness and curvilinear contour.\r\nThe Parrott gun, patented October 1, 1861, No. 33,401, and May 6, 1862,\r\nNo. 35,171, comprehended a form of hooped ordnance in which the breech\r\nwas re-enforced by an encompassing hoop or sleeve, which was shrunk on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 267.--THE KRUPP BREECH MECHANISM.]\r\n\r\n_Breech-Loading Ordnance._--While the breech-loading cannon is several\r\ncenturies old, and was, in fact, one of the first forms of that firearm,\r\nit is to this principle of action that the rapid fire and great\r\nexecution of the modern weapon are chiefly due. The earliest of existing\r\nforms of breech mechanism is that which comprehends the channeling of\r\nthe breech transversely to receive a tapered plug, which permits the\r\ncharge to be placed in the open rear end of the gun in front of the\r\nchannel, and the transverse plug then closed behind the charge. This is\r\ndescribed in Hadley’s British patent No. 577, of 1741; was first\r\npatented in the United States in a modified form by Wright and Gould,\r\nNo. 22,325, December 14, 1858, and afterwards came to be known as the\r\nBroadwell system, being developed by him and covered in patents No.\r\n33,876, of December 10, 1861; No. 43,553, July 12, 1864, and No. 55,762,\r\nJune 19, 1866. This general principle is still employed by Krupp in\r\nsome of his guns, and as used by him is shown in Fig. 267. The\r\ntransverse channel through the breech is tapered, and the sliding breech\r\nblock X is slightly wedge-shaped to fit tightly therein. When the breech\r\nblock is withdrawn for loading, as shown, a sleeve S, shown in dotted\r\nlines, is temporarily arranged in alignment with the bore and gives\r\nsmooth passage way to the charge to a position in front of the breech\r\nblock. This sleeve is then withdrawn, the breech block forced in, and is\r\nthere locked by a turn of the threads of a locking screw _b_ into the\r\ncorresponding recesses _a_ in the breech. A detachable wrench _e_ may be\r\napplied either to the screw _d b_ to turn it to lock or unlock, or to\r\nthe traversing screw _c_, which, by engaging with a nut (not shown),\r\nruns the breech block in and out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 268.--INTERRUPTED THREAD BREECH MECHANISM.]\r\n\r\nBy far the most popular principle of the breech block, however, is that\r\nof the interrupted thread, shown in Fig. 268, in which the plug, when\r\nclosed, has its axis in alignment with the axial bore of the gun. Its\r\nthreads are interrupted by longitudinally arranged channels, and the\r\nbreech of the gun has corresponding threads and channels. When the plug\r\nis pushed into the gun, the screw threads of the plug enter the channels\r\nof the breech, and a rotary turn of the screw plug then locks its\r\nthreads into those of the breech. The screw plug is supported by a\r\ncarrier hinged at one side to the gun, and arranged to swing the plug\r\ninto axial alignment with the bore, or be thrown to one side to admit\r\nthe charge. The patents to Chambers, No. 6,612, July 31, 1849 (re-issue\r\nNo. 237, April 19, 1853), and to Cochran, No. 26,256, November 29, 1859,\r\nare the earliest American examples of this principle of action, and are\r\nbelieved to be the original inventions of the same.\r\n\r\nIn one form or another this construction enters into most all modern\r\nbreech mechanisms. Among the forms used by the United States are the\r\nDriggs-Seabury, the Dashiell, and the Vickers-Maxim. To prevent the\r\nexpanding gases from driving through the crevices of the breech block,\r\nexpanding or swelling rings, known as gas checks, are arranged on the\r\nfront of the breech block. De Bange’s patent, No. 301,220, July 1, 1884,\r\ncovers the most popular form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 269.--SIGHTING A SIX-INCH RAPID FIRE GUN.]\r\n\r\nThe elements of efficiency of the modern rapid-fire breech-loading rifle\r\nare to be found in the following features: First, in the increased\r\nlength of the gun, which, for a 6-inch gun is now as much as 25 feet,\r\nthe increased length lending a longer period of expansion for the\r\nexplosion of the powder charge, and imparting a correspondingly higher\r\nmomentum; secondly, in the fixed ammunition, which means a cartridge\r\ncase in which a metallic shell encloses the powder charge, and is\r\nconnected with the projectile, and third, in the great improvement and\r\nrapidity of action of the breech mechanism, which permits as many as\r\neight rounds per minute to be fired. In Fig. 269 is shown a 6-inch\r\nrapid-fire gun of the United States Navy, loaded, and being sighted for\r\nfire. Rapid-fire guns of this class represent the most effective form of\r\nmodern ordnance. It was largely such rapid fire batteries of Admiral\r\nDewey’s squadron that swept the Spanish fleet out of existence at\r\nManila, and that demolished the fleet of Cervera at Santiago by the\r\nawful hail of shells poured into his ships. These relatively small guns\r\nthrow a shell six miles, and the striking energy of their projectiles at\r\nthe muzzle is equal to the penetration of iron plate 21 inches thick, or\r\n16 inches of steel. When the gun is loaded, it is held in the forward\r\nposition by coil springs, inclosed in cylinders and holding a recoil\r\nseat for the trunnions, and also has two pistons traveling in cylinders\r\nfilled with glycerine. When the gun is fired, the recoil causes it to\r\nslide back, carrying the pistons, and the recoil is checked by the\r\nresistance of the glycerine traveling through an opening past the\r\npistons. After full recoil, the gun is automatically returned to its\r\nforward position by the action of the coil springs, which are compressed\r\nduring the recoil. The gun crew is protected by Harveyized steel plate 4\r\ninches thick, and the gun is so delicately mounted on ball bearings that\r\nits great weight of 7½ tons responds readily to the slight pressure in\r\ntraining the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 270.--RANGE OF SIXTEEN-INCH GUN.]\r\n\r\nPowerful as these guns appear to be, their big brothers in the revolving\r\nturrets are far more so. While not so nimble in action, the great power\r\nof these guns of the main battery, and the elaboration and completeness\r\nof mechanism for operating them, for supplying them with ammunition, and\r\nfor rotating the turrets, constitute a complete world in ordnance in\r\nitself. As the gun increases in size, its cost both in construction and\r\nservice increases in a greatly disproportionate ratio. A 6-inch\r\nbreech-loading rifle costs $64.40 for each discharge, while a 12-inch\r\ngun costs $458 for each discharge. The largest guns of our battleships\r\nare of 13 inch calibre, and about 40 feet long, but larger ones are\r\nemployed for sea coast defenses. The great 16-inch 126-ton gun, now\r\nbuilding for the United States at the Watervliet arsenal, is 49¼ feet\r\nlong, over 6 feet in diameter at the breech, and it will have an extreme\r\nrange of over twenty miles. Its projectile will weigh 2,370 pounds, and\r\nit will cost $865 to fire the gun once. The accompanying view, Fig. 270,\r\nwill give graphic illustration of the range of this gun. If fired at its\r\nmaximum elevation from the battery at the south end of New York in a\r\nnortherly direction, its projectile would pass over the city of New\r\nYork, over Grant’s Tomb, Spuyten Duyvil, Riverdale, Mount St. Vincent,\r\nLudlow, Yonkers, and would land near Hastings-on-the-Hudson, nearly\r\ntwenty miles away, as shown in our map, Fig. 271. The extreme height of\r\nits trajectory would be 30,516 feet, or nearly six miles. This means\r\nthat if Pike’s Peak, of the Western Hemisphere, had piled on top of it\r\nMont Blanc, of the Eastern Hemisphere, this gun would hurl its enormous\r\nprojectile so high above them both as to still leave space below its\r\ncurve to build Washington’s Monument on top of Mont Blanc, as shown in\r\nFig. 270.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 271.--RADIUS OF ACTION OF SIXTEEN-INCH GUN.]\r\n\r\n_The Disappearing Gun._--The importance of secreting the location of the\r\nbattery in coast defences, and the better protection of the gunners,\r\nhave suggested a species of gun carriage which would permit the gun to\r\nbe normally hidden behind and under the protection of the parapet, and\r\nbe only temporarily elevated to a position above the parapet while\r\nfiring. Various forms of this have been devised. General R. E. De Russy,\r\nCorps Engineers, U. S. A., devised such a carriage in 1835. Moncrieff,\r\nof England, was one of the first to put in practice such a form of\r\ncarriage. United States patents covering this invention were granted him\r\nas follows: No. 83,873, November 10, 1868; No. 115,502, May 30, 1871,\r\nand No. 144,120, October 28, 1873. Its principle of operation was to\r\nutilize the force of the recoil as a power to raise the gun into firing\r\nposition. The gun is fulcrumed in a lever frame provided with a\r\ncounterpoise which more than balances the gun. When the gun is fired the\r\nrecoil raises the counterweight, and the gun descends and is locked in\r\nits lower position. When loaded and released the counterpoise raises the\r\ngun again to firing position.\r\n\r\nAmong later gun carriages of this type of American construction may be\r\nmentioned those devised by Spiller, Gordon, Howell, and others, but the\r\none most generally known is the Buffington-Crozier, covered by patents\r\nNo. 555,426, February 25, 1896, and No. 613,252, November 1, 1898. This\r\ncarriage, sustaining the 8 and 10 inch breech-loading rifles at Fort\r\nWadsworth for the defence of New York harbor, is shown in Figs. 272\r\nand 273, Fig. 272 representing it in its lowered position, and Fig. 273\r\nin its elevated position for firing. The trunnions of the gun rest in\r\nbearings at the upper ends of the pair of levers, which latter are\r\nfulcrumed near the middle to horizontally sliding carriages connected to\r\nhydraulic cylinders that move backward as the gun recoils. These\r\ncylinders move over stationary pistons which have orifices that allow\r\nthe liquid to pass from one side of the piston to the other. As the gun\r\nrecoils and the levers turn to the horizontal position, the forward ends\r\nof the levers are made to raise vertically an immense leaden\r\ncounterweight, weighing 32,000 pounds, which ordinarily over-balances\r\nthe weight of the gun on the levers. This cylindrical counterweight is\r\nseen raised on the left of Fig. 272. In firing, the energy of the recoil\r\nis absorbed partly by raising the counterweight, and partly by the\r\nresistance of the hydraulic cylinders, and when the gun reaches its\r\nlowest position it is caught and retained by pawls. After loading the\r\npawls are tripped, and the greater gravity of the counterweight raises\r\nthe gun to firing position again. Ten shots from an 8-inch gun on this\r\ncarriage have been fired in 12 minutes 21 seconds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 272.--BUFFINGTON-CROZIER DISAPPEARING GUN, LOWERED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 273.--BUFFINGTON-CROZIER DISAPPEARING GUN, ELEVATED\r\nFOR FIRING.]\r\n\r\n_The Machine Gun._--During the Civil War a gun made its appearance\r\nwhich, although of small calibre, rivaled in its deadly effectiveness\r\nthe wholesale slaughter of the cannon. It was a new type, and was known\r\nas the machine gun, or battery gun, in which balls of comparatively\r\nsmall size were discharged uninterruptedly and in incredible succession.\r\nIt was the invention of Dr. R. J. Gatling, and was covered by him in\r\npatents No. 36,836, November 4, 1862, and No. 47,631, May 9, 1865, and\r\nin many subsequent patents for minor improvements, and is now\r\nuniversally known as the Gatling gun. It consisted of a circular series\r\nof barrels mounted on a central shaft, and revolved by suitable gears\r\nand a hand crank. The cartridges were automatically and successively fed\r\ninto the chambers of the barrel, and its several hammers were so\r\narranged in connection with the barrels that the whole operation of\r\nloading, closing the breech, discharging and expelling the empty\r\ncartridge cases was conducted while the barrels were kept in a\r\ncontinuous revolving movement by turning the hand crank. In Fig. 274 is\r\nshown a modern example of the Gatling gun equipped with the Accles feed.\r\nOrdinarily the gun has ten barrels, with ten corresponding locks, which\r\nrevolve together during the working of the gun. When the gun is in\r\naction there are always five cartridges going through the process of\r\nloading, and five empty shells in different stages of being extracted,\r\nand many hundred shots a minute can be fired. Many modifications of this\r\ngun have been made by Hotchkiss and others. Maxim, Nordenfelt, and\r\nBenet have each made valuable inventions in machine guns of a somewhat\r\ndifferent type, some of which utilize the force of the exploding charges\r\nto react on the feed and firing mechanism, and thus furnish the power to\r\ncontinue the consecutive operation of the gun, so that no hand crank is\r\nrequired, but the gun works itself with an incessant hail of balls until\r\nits supply of cartridges is exhausted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 274.--GATLING GUN ON UNITED STATES ARMY MODEL\r\nCARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\n_The Dynamite Gun._--Most impressive to the layman, and most\r\ndemoralizing to the enemy, is this latter day form of ordnance. The\r\nfirst efforts to hurl dynamite shells from a gun were made with\r\ncompressed air for fear of prematurely exploding the sensitive dynamite\r\nin the gun, which would be more disastrous to the gunners themselves\r\nthan to the enemy. The Zalinski dynamite gun was of this class, and the\r\nfirst which attained any notoriety. Foolhardy as it might appear, Yankee\r\ngenius was led to believe that dynamite shells could be fired with\r\npowder charges, and this is now done in a practical and safe way in the\r\nSims-Dudley Dynamite Gun. This is manufactured under the fundamental\r\npatents of Dudley, Nos. 407,474, 407,475, 407,476, of July 23, 1889,\r\nwhich cover a method of exploding a charge of powder in one gun barrel,\r\nand causing it to compress the air in front of it, and force it into\r\nanother barrel behind the dynamite shell, so that this relatively cool\r\nbody of air is interposed between the hot powder gases and the\r\ndynamite. Fig. 275 represents Dudley’s patent drawing. C is the powder\r\ncharge in barrel A, and H is the dynamite shell in barrel G. The front\r\nof barrel A is connected to the rear of barrel G behind the dynamite\r\nshell by the tube F. When the powder C explodes, all the air in barrel A\r\nand tube F is driven out and acts on the dynamite shell H to discharge\r\nit without allowing it to come in contact with the hot powder gases. A\r\nfrangible plate D closes the end of barrel A, but blows out above a\r\ncertain pressure to avoid bursting strain in the gun. The Sims patent,\r\nNo. 619,025, February 7, 1899, covers a more simple and practical form\r\nof constructing a gun on this principle, and the gun as used in the\r\nUnited States is constructed in accordance with this latter improvement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 275.--DYNAMITE GUN, DUDLEY’S PATENT, JULY 23, 1889.]\r\n\r\n_Small Arms._--Pistols and guns are the two classes into which the\r\nlayman divides small arms, although in latter years this classification\r\nhas been much disturbed by the western frontiersman, who calls his\r\npistol a gun, and by the artillerist, who also calls his cannon a gun.\r\n\r\n_The pistol_ may be defined as a small arm held in one hand to be fired.\r\nIt is an ancient weapon, but had attained no special importance or\r\npopularity prior to the Nineteenth Century. The duelling pistol, with\r\nits long barrel, its hair trigger and inlaid stock, and the derringer,\r\nwith its short barrel of large bore, were the popular forms. Not until\r\nthe revolver made its appearance did the pistol attain any importance.\r\nColt is popularly credited with having invented this, but it is really a\r\nvery old principle. In the Alte Deutscher Drehling Der Ruckladungs\r\nGewehre, by Edward Zernin, 1872, Darmstadt and Leipzig, is shown an\r\nancient form of match lock revolver, said to belong to the period\r\n1480-1500. It is probably the same as the match-lock revolver in the\r\nmuseum of the Tower of London, which is also credited to the Fifteenth\r\nCentury. In the British patent to Puckle, No. 418, of 1718, is shown and\r\ndescribed a well-constructed revolver carried on a tripod, and of the\r\ndimensions of the modern machine gun. The inventor naïvely states that\r\nit has round chambers for round balls, designed for Christians, and\r\nsquare chambers, with square balls, for the Turks. The first revolving\r\nfirearm in the United States was made by John Gill, of Newberne, N. C.,\r\nin 1829. It had fourteen chambers, and was a percussion gun, but was\r\nnever patented. The first revolver patented in the United States was\r\nthat to D. G. Colburn, June 29, 1833. The revolver of Col. Samuel Colt\r\nwas patented February 25, 1836, (re-issue No. 124, October 24, 1848),\r\nand again August 29, 1839, No. 1,304; September 3, 1850, No. 7,613, and\r\nSeptember 10, 1850, No. 7,629. It was the first practical invention of\r\nthis kind, and it embodied as a leading feature the automatic rotation\r\nof the cylinder in cocking by a pawl on the hammer engaging a ratchet on\r\nthe end of the cylinder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 276.--SMITH & WESSON REVOLVER DISCHARGING SHELLS.]\r\n\r\nVarious types followed, such as the old pepper box, patented by Darling\r\nApril 13, 1836; the self-cocking pepper box, patented by Allen, No.\r\n3,998, April 16, 1845; the four sliding barrels of Sharp, No. 6,960,\r\nDecember 18, 1849, and many others. The most popular and successful,\r\nhowever, of the succeeding types is that of Smith & Wesson, shown in\r\nFig. 276, and covered by many patents. One of its most important\r\nfeatures is the simultaneous extraction of the shells by an ejector,\r\nhaving a stem sliding through the cylinder. This was the invention of W.\r\nC. Dodge, patented January 17, 1865, No. 45,912, re-issue No. 4,483,\r\nJuly 25, 1871. In Fig. 277 is shown Smith & Wesson’s latest pattern of\r\nHammerless Safety Revolver, with automatic shell extractor and\r\nrebounding lock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 277.--SMITH & WESSON SELF ACTING HAMMERLESS\r\nREVOLVER.]\r\n\r\nThe latest development in this class of arms is the _automatic magazine\r\npistol_, designed for the use of the officers of the German army, and\r\nadapted to fire ten shots in as many seconds. Only a slight pressure on\r\nthe trigger is necessary, as it is not required to perform the work of\r\nturning any other part by the trigger, as is the case in the\r\nself-cocking revolver. The pressure of gas at each explosion does all\r\nthe work of pushing back the closing piece of the breech through the\r\nrecoil of the shell, extracts and ejects the shell, cocks the hammer,\r\nand also compresses recuperative springs, which effect the reloading and\r\nclosing of the weapon, all of these functions being performed in proper\r\nsequence at each explosion in a fraction of a second. The act of firing\r\nthus prepares the pistol for the next shot automatically. In Fig. 278\r\nare shown two makes of pistol of this type. No. 1 is known as the Mauser\r\n(United States patent No. 584,479, June 15, 1897); No. 2 shows it with\r\nan extemporized stock, to be used as a carbine in firing from the\r\nshoulder. This stock is hollow and forms the holster or case for the\r\npistol. At No. 3 is shown the Mannlicher pistol (United States patent\r\nNo. 581,296, April 27, 1897), which is another form of the same type. In\r\nthe Mauser the breech moves to the rear during recoil. In the Mannlicher\r\nthe barrel moves to the front, leaving space for a fresh cartridge to\r\ncome up from the magazine below. The calibre of this pistol is 0.3\r\ninch, and the initial velocity 1,395 feet. At 33 feet the ball passes\r\nthrough 10¾ inches of spruce, at 490 through 5 inches, and its extreme\r\nrange is 3,000 feet, or more than half a mile. When empty it is quickly\r\nre-charged with cartridges, which are made up in sets of ten in a case\r\nand inserted in one movement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 278.--AUTOMATIC PISTOLS.]\r\n\r\n_Breech-Loading Guns._--Although the breech-loading principle was well\r\nknown prior to the Nineteenth Century, it remained for this period to\r\ngive it effective development. The first United States patent for a\r\nbreech-loading gun was to Thornton and Hall, May 21, 1811. It was a\r\nflint lock, and many of these arms were made at Harper’s Ferry Armory in\r\n1814, and issued to the troops, one being given by order of Congress to\r\neach member of Congress to take home with him to show to his\r\nconstituents. The present style of break-down gun was invented by Pauly,\r\nin France, and is to be found in his British patent No. 3,833, of 1814.\r\nLefaucheux, of Paris, however, made this form of gun practical.\r\nMinesinger, in United States patent No. 6,139, February 27, 1849,\r\nsupplied the important improvement of making the front edge of the\r\nmetallic cartridge shell thinner than elsewhere, so as to expand by the\r\npressure of the exploding charge, and swell to a tight fit of the\r\nbarrel. The Maynard rifle, first patented May 27, 1851, No. 8,126, was\r\none of the earliest practical forms of breech-loaders.\r\n\r\n_Magazine Guns._--Walter Hunt’s United States patent No. 6,663, August\r\n21, 1849, was the first on a magazine firearm of modern type. It had a\r\nsliding breech block carrying the main spring and firing pin. The\r\nSpencer rifle was one of the early ones that came into use. This had a\r\nrow of cartridges in the stock, and was first patented March 6, 1860,\r\nNo. 27,393. It was this weapon which in the Civil War gave proof of the\r\ndeadly efficacy of the breech-loading magazine gun, and its superiority\r\nto the old style military arm. Another type of magazine firearm which in\r\nthe last half century has gained great prominence and popularity is the\r\nso-called “Winchester.” This has its cartridges arranged in a tube below\r\nand parallel with the barrel, and they are fed in a column to the rear\r\nby a helical spring as fast as they are used up at the breech. The\r\npioneer of this type is the arm patented by Smith & Wesson February 14,\r\n1854, No. 10,535, re-issued December 30, 1873, No. 5,710. This was\r\nsubsequently improved as to the extractor by B. F. Henry in patent No.\r\n30,446, October 16, 1860, re-issued December 7, 1868, No. 3,227, and was\r\nmanufactured and favorably known for many years as the _Henry rifle_.\r\nThis rifle was also used in the Civil War. O. F. Winchester subsequently\r\nre-organized it in patent No. 57,808, September 4, 1866, and the arm in\r\nlate years has taken his name.\r\n\r\n_The Needle Gun_, of Prussia, represents an early form of breech loader,\r\nand may be considered the prototype of the modern bolt gun. The needle\r\ngun has in the place of the swinging hammer a rectilinearly sliding\r\nbolt, carrying in front a needle which pierces the charge and ignites\r\nthe fulminate by its friction. Its construction permits the fulminate\r\nto be placed in advance of the powder, which thus burns from the front,\r\nand is entirely consumed in the gun, instead of being partially blown\r\nout of the gun, as may occur when ignited in the rear. The needle gun\r\nwas invented by Dreyse in 1838, was first introduced about 1846, and\r\ngave effective service in the Prusso-Austrian war of 1866. The\r\n_Chassepot_, brought out in 1867, United States patent No. 60,832, was a\r\nFrench development of the Prussian needle gun.\r\n\r\nAbout 1879 two forms of magazine guns appeared which have become types\r\nfor most all subsequent guns of this class. Both of them employed the\r\nbolt system as previously embodied in the needle gun, but added to it\r\nthe magazine principle and changed the method of supplying and feeding\r\nthe cartridges. One was the invention of James Lee, and the other was\r\nthe joint invention of Colonel Livermore, of the Corps of Engineers, and\r\nMajor Russell, of the Ordnance Department, U. S. A. In the Lee, whose\r\nname has been much in evidence in late years, there was a relatively\r\nsmall detachable box (see Fig. 279) capable of holding five cartridges\r\nand designed to be filled and then placed in a slot opening centrally\r\nunder the gun, below the receiver, and directly in front of the trigger\r\nguard. A spring within the magazine fed the cartridges up into alignment\r\nwith the barrel. Lee’s first patent was No. 221,328, November 4, 1879.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 279.--LEE’S MAGAZINE RIFLE, PATENTED NOVEMBER 4,\r\n1879.]\r\n\r\nThe Livermore-Russell gun, patented October 28, 1879, No. 221,079, had a\r\nmagazine opening transversely in the upper edge of the stock behind the\r\nbolt, and the cartridges were fed to the barrel beneath the bolt. The\r\nimportant feature of the gun, however, was a cartridge case slotted on\r\nits side and detachable from the gun, and each bearing a group of five\r\ncartridges, which were to be thus made up in small packets and carried\r\nin the belt or cartridge box of the soldier. This idea was subsequently\r\ndeveloped by Livermore and Russell in patent No. 230,823, August 3,\r\n1880, and this feature, viewed in the light of the importance\r\nsubsequently attained by the “clip” in the Mauser and Mannlicher guns,\r\nmay be fairly considered the pioneer of this idea of grouping cartridges\r\nin made-up packets for bolt guns. Its great advantage is the large\r\nnumber of shots that may be fired in a short space of time without an\r\nexcessive weight in the gun itself.\r\n\r\nSubsequent patents for improvements were taken by Lee as follows: No.\r\n513,647, January 30, 1894, and No. 547,583, October 8, 1895, and the gun\r\nused by the United States Navy is modeled along the lines of Lee’s\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 280.--KRAG-JORGENSEN MAGAZINE RIFLE.]\r\n\r\n_The Krag-Jorgensen Magazine Rifle_ was patented June 10, 1890, No.\r\n429,811, and February 21, 1893, No. 492,212. It is the arm adopted by\r\nthe United States infantry service, and is seen in Fig. 280. The fixed\r\nmagazine chamber, shown in the cross section, passes through the breech\r\nlaterally below the barrel, and is filled with cartridges on one side of\r\nthe gun, which cartridges pass through the breech laterally, and,\r\nturning a curve, enter the barrel from the opposite side. When the bolt\r\nis drawn back by the knob handle a cartridge is fed up into position to\r\nenter the barrel, and when pushed forward the cartridge is forced into\r\nthe bore of the gun, and at the same time a spiral spring is put under\r\ntension to set the hammer of the gun, which carries a firing pin at its\r\nfront end. When the trigger is pulled the hammer and firing pin plunge\r\nforward to explode the cap in the cartridge, and when the handle of the\r\nbolt is drawn back again to extract the empty shell, a fresh cartridge\r\nrises to take its place.\r\n\r\n_The Mauser Rifle_ is shown in Fig. 281. This is the arm of which so\r\nmuch was heard during the recent war with Spain, and against which our\r\nsoldiers had to contend. Five cartridges are carried in a magazine\r\nimmediately in front of the trigger, and are fed up by a subjacent\r\nspring, one at a time, centrally through the breech into line with the\r\nbarrel, as the bolt with the knobbed handle is worked back and forth.\r\nThe cartridges are carried by the soldier in groups of five in a “clip,”\r\nwhich is a simple strip of metal with inturned parallel edges, which\r\nenclose the flanged heads of the cartridges as they project at right\r\nangles to the clip. To transfer the cartridges to the magazine, the\r\nclip with its cartridges is placed above the barrel, and the cartridges\r\nforced down out of the clip into the magazine. In the Mannlicher gun,\r\nadopted by the German army, the clip which holds the cartridges is\r\nitself inserted into the magazine, along with the cartridges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 281.--THE MAUSER RIFLE AND CLIP.]\r\n\r\nThe modern trend of development in firearms has been toward the\r\nreduction of calibre, the standard for small arms being 30/100. The lead\r\nbullets are covered with a seamless jacket of harder metal (Geiger’s\r\npatents, No. 306,738 and 306,739, October 21, 1884), which prevents the\r\n“leading” and fouling of the gun, and the distortion of the bullet.\r\nModern magazine guns permit twenty-five to thirty shots a minute as\r\nsingle loaders, and besides they hold in reserve five cartridges. They\r\nhave a killing range of a mile, and the cost of the cartridge is 3.2\r\ncents. At a trial at the Washington Navy Yard a few years past a steel\r\nprojectile 1.07 inches long and 32/100 calibre penetrated solid iron\r\n1.15 inch thick, fired at an angle of 80°. It also penetrated 50 inches\r\nof pine boards, and its range was estimated at three miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 282.--THE GREENER HAMMERLESS GUN.]\r\n\r\n_Hammerless Guns._--Among improvements in shot guns the so-called\r\n“hammerless” feature is a noteworthy departure. This hides the hammers\r\nin the breech and cocks them by the act of breaking down the gun. In\r\nFig. 282 is given a section and plan view of the Greener mechanism,\r\nwhich was patented July 6, 1880, No. 229,604, and was one of the first\r\nguns of this kind put on the market. The hammers A are constructed as\r\nelbow levers. Their upper ends have each a round point adapted to strike\r\nthrough a small hole in the breech onto the cap of the cartridge. The\r\nlower front portions of the hammers are extended forward and curved\r\ninwardly toward each other, so that their inner ends nearly meet. C is a\r\npendent hook jointed to the barrel, and when the latter is tilted, as\r\nshown in dotted lines, the hook acting upon the forwardly projecting\r\narms of the hammers turns them backward to the cocked position, in which\r\nthey are retained by the dogs B engaging with their notches. As the\r\nhammers move back the mainspring is compressed, and when the dog B is\r\nremoved from the notch by pulling on the trigger, the hammers are\r\nreleased and the gun fired.\r\n\r\n_The rebounding lock_, now universally applied to shot guns, is another\r\ncomparatively recent improvement. This promotes safety by causing the\r\nhammers to be normally and automatically held away from the firing pins.\r\nThe first practical form of this lock was patented by Hailer, July 26,\r\n1870, No. 105,799, in which a single spring serves to deliver the blow\r\nof the hammer and also withdraws the hammer from the firing pin. A\r\nmarked tendency in shot guns in late years is toward a reduction in\r\nbore, many sportsmen now using a 28 gauge in preference to the old\r\nregulation 12.\r\n\r\nNearly 5,000 patents have been granted in the United States for\r\nfirearms, and about 2,400 for projectiles. The most important of the\r\nlatter is the torpedo, of which the Whitehead, or fish torpedo, which\r\nsupplies its own means of propulsion, is the best known and most used.\r\nIt was first brought out in 1866 by Whitehead, at Fiume, a port of\r\nHungary. The Gathmann aerial torpedo, weighing 1,800 pounds and carrying\r\n625 pounds of wet gun cotton, is designed to be fired from a gun 44 feet\r\nlong and 18 inch bore, and is supposed to have a range of ten miles.\r\nTests are about to be made under special appropriation of Congress, and\r\nif its claim can be substantiated, it may become the most destructive\r\nengine of warfare known.\r\n\r\n_Explosives._--The invention of gunpowder is ascribed to the Chinese,\r\nand at a period so far back that its origin is buried in antiquity. It\r\nis believed to have been known since the time of Moses, something very\r\nlike it being mentioned in the ancient Gentoo laws of India 1,500 to\r\n2,000 B. C. For many years it was thought that Roger Bacon invented it\r\nin 1249, but it is now known that he was only a factor in its\r\ndevelopment. Most likely the saltpetre of the plains of China came first\r\nin accidental contact with the charred embers of a prehistoric fire, and\r\nto the observant man the oxygen-giving saltpetre furnished the charcoal\r\nwith its means of energetic combustion for the first time.\r\n\r\nGunpowder consists of about 75 parts of saltpetre (nitrate of potash),\r\n15 of charcoal, and 10 of sulphur, the proportions varying somewhat with\r\nthe use to which it is to be applied. In ordinary combustion the air\r\nsupplies the necessary oxygen. In gunpowder the presence of the air is\r\nnot necessary, as the saltpetre has imprisoned in its composition a\r\nlarge quantity of oxygen which furnishes to the carbon and sulphur the\r\nmeans for its combustion, gasification and enormous expansion.\r\nOriginally, gunpowder was pulverulent, like that used in fire works, and\r\nhad but little propelling force. The making of it in grains (“corned”)\r\nis ascribed to Berthold Schwarz, a German monk, about 1320, and this, by\r\npromoting the rapidity of its burning, added greatly to its effective\r\nforce, and gave a new impetus to firearms.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the Nineteenth Century there were but few\r\nimprovements in either the composition or manufacture of gunpowder. The\r\nintroduction of the percussion cap, which exploded the charge by a blow,\r\nin the place of the old flint lock, was, however, a notable advance.\r\nAlexander John Forsyth, a Scotch clergyman, was the first to apply a\r\npercussion or detonating compound, as set forth in his British patent\r\nNo. 3,032, of 1807. The embodiment of such compounds in the little\r\ncopper caps was made about 1818, and has been claimed by various\r\nparties. Manton’s British patent No. 4,285, of 1818, describes a thin\r\ncopper tube filled with fulminate and struck sidewise by the hammer to\r\nexplode it. Joshua Shaw took a United States patent on a percussion gun,\r\nJune 19, 1822, and the copper percussion cap was said to have been\r\nintroduced in the United States by him in 1842. The embodiment of the\r\ncharge of powder and ball in brass and copper shells was done in France\r\nby Galay Cazalat as early as 1826. Drawn metallic shells were made by\r\nFlobert and Lefaucheux, in 1853, and Palmer, in 1854. Drawn copper\r\ncartridges with center fire were introduced in the United States, and\r\npatented by Smith & Wesson August 8, 1854, No. 11,496, and solid headed\r\nshells by Hotchkiss, August 31, 1869, No. 94,210.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 283.--SUBMARINE MINE. CHARGE, 250 POUNDS DYNAMITE.]\r\n\r\nIn 1846 a new and distinct development in explosives was made in the\r\ndiscovery of gun cotton by Schönbein, and of nitro-glycerine in 1847 by\r\nSobrero. The former is made by the reaction of nitric acid, aided by\r\nsulphuric acid, on ordinary raw cotton, which, while changing the\r\nphysical aspects of the cotton but little, gives to it a terrific\r\nexplosive energy. Nitro-glycerine is made in a somewhat similar way by\r\ntreating glycerine with nitric and sulphuric acids. At first it found no\r\npractical applications, except as a homœopathic medicine for headache,\r\nbut about 1864 Nobel commenced its manufacture for explosive uses, and\r\nsince that time nearly all the great blasting operations have been\r\nperformed through its agency. Its most familiar form is _dynamite_, or\r\ngiant powder, Nobel’s patent, No. 78,317, May 26, 1868, which is simply\r\nnitro-glycerine held in absorption by some inert granular solid, such as\r\ninfusorial earth, and is thus rendered safer to handle and more\r\nconvenient to use. A suggestive application of the terrible power of\r\nthese explosives is in submarine mines. The instantaneous and dastardly\r\ndestruction of our battleship, “The Maine,” with 250 of her crew, in\r\nHavana harbor, February 15, 1898, by one of these agencies, is a\r\nharrowing illustration. Fig. 283 represents one of these submarine mines\r\ncarrying 250 pounds of dynamite, and Fig. 284 is an instantaneous\r\nphotograph at the moment of explosion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 284.--EXPLOSION OF A MINE. BASE OF WATER COLUMN, 100\r\nFEET WIDE, HEIGHT, 246 FEET.]\r\n\r\n_White gunpowder_, or wood powder, was invented by Captain Schultz, of\r\nthe Prussian army. It is made by treating granulated wood with a mixture\r\nof nitric and sulphuric acids, which, acting upon the cellulose of the\r\nwood, convert it into an explosive something of the nature of gun\r\ncotton. The grains are afterward saturated with saltpetre. This was\r\npatented in the United States June 2, 1863, No. 38,789, and in Great\r\nBritain, No. 900, of 1864. Dittmar’s powder is another of the same\r\ngeneral nature, covered by United States patents No. 98,854, January\r\n18, 1870; No. 99,069, January 25, 1870, and No. 145,403, December 9,\r\n1873.\r\n\r\nAmong the high explosives of more recent date may be mentioned:\r\n\r\n    _Tonite_ (gun cotton and barium nitrate), British patents No. 3,612,\r\n    of 1874, and No. 2,742, of 1876.\r\n\r\n     _Rack-a-rock_ (potassium chlorate and nitro-benzene), United States\r\n     patent No. 243,432, June 28, 1881; British patent No. 5,584, of\r\n     1881.\r\n\r\n     _Bellite_ (ammonium nitrate and nitro-benzene), United States\r\n     patent No. 455,217, June 30, 1891; British patent No. 13,690, of\r\n     1885.\r\n\r\n     _Melinite_ (picric acid and gun cotton), British patent No. 15,089,\r\n     of 1885.\r\n\r\n     _Lyddite_, not patented, but believed to be substantially same as\r\n     melinite, and containing for its active ingredient picric acid,\r\n     which is a compound formed by the reaction of nitric acid on\r\n     carbolic acid.\r\n\r\n     _Cordite_ (nitro-glycerine, gun cotton, and mineral jelly or oil),\r\n     British patent No. 5,614, of 1889; United States patent No.\r\n     409,549, August 20, 1889.\r\n\r\n     _Indurite_ (gun cotton and nitro-benzene, indurated), United States\r\n     patent, No. 489,684, January 10, 1893; British patent, No. 580, of\r\n     1893.\r\n\r\nIn recent years smokeless powders have largely superseded all others.\r\nThese contain usually nitro-cellulose (gun cotton), or nitro-glycerine,\r\nor both, made up into a plastic, coherent, and homogeneous compound of a\r\ngluey nature, and fashioned into horn-like sticks or rods by being\r\nforced under pressure through a die plate having small holes, through\r\nwhich the plastic material is strained into strings like macaroni, or\r\nelse is molded into tablets, pellets, or grains of cubical shape.\r\nProminent among those who have contributed to this art are the names of\r\nTurpin, Abel and Dewar, Nobel, Maxim, Munroe, Du Pont, Bernadou and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIn the recent years of the Nineteenth Century great activity has been\r\nmanifest in this field of invention. In the United States more than 600\r\ndifferent patents have been granted for explosives, the larger portion\r\nof them being for nitro-compounds, which partake in a greater or less\r\ndegree of the qualities of gun cotton or nitro-glycerine. The influence\r\nexerted by them has been incalculable. Subtile as is the force\r\nimprisoned in inter-atomic relation, it has been the power behind the\r\nboom of the cannon; it has lent itself to the driving of great tunnels\r\nthrough the solid rock; it has lifted the coal and ore from the solid\r\nembrace of the mountain, and the building stone from its sleep in the\r\nquarry; it has opened up channels to the sea, canals on land, and in\r\nboth war and peace has been one of the great agencies of civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nTEXTILES.\r\n\r\n    SPINNING AND WEAVING AN ANCIENT ART--HARGREAVES’ SPINNING JENNY--\r\n    ARKWRIGHT’S ROLL-DRAWING SPINNING MACHINE--CROMPTON’S MULE\r\n    SPINNER--THE COTTON GIN--RING SPINNING--THE RABBETH SPINDLE--JOHN\r\n    KAY’S FLYING SHUTTLE AND ROBERT KAY’S DROP BOX--CARTWRIGHT’S POWER\r\n    LOOM--THE JACQUARD LOOM--CROMPTON’S FANCY LOOM--BIGELOW’S CARPET\r\n    LOOMS--LYALL POSITIVE MOTION LOOM--KNITTING MACHINES--CLOTH PRESSING\r\n    MACHINERY--ARTIFICIAL SILK--MERCERIZED CLOTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nFar back in the obscuring gloom of a prehistoric antiquity, man wore\r\nprobably only the hirsute covering which nature gave him. As he emerged\r\nfrom barbarism, sentiments of modesty marked the evolution of his mind,\r\nand this, together with the need for a more sufficient protection\r\nagainst cold and heat, suggested an artificial covering for his body. At\r\nfirst he robbed the brute of his fleecy skin and wore it bodily. Later\r\nhe learned to spin and weave; next to food and drink, clothing became a\r\nfundamental necessity, for without it his life could not extend outside\r\nof the limited zone of the tropics. Food and drink were to be found as\r\nnature’s free gifts, but clothing had to be made, and its manufacture\r\nconstituted probably the oldest of all the living arts. The making of\r\ncloth may be said to be coeval with history. The Old Testament of the\r\nBible is replete with references to spinning and weaving, and the cloths\r\nwrapped about the mummies of ancient Egypt, although thousands of years\r\nold, were of exceeding regularity and fineness.\r\n\r\nSo old an art, and so great and continuous a need for its products\r\nnecessarily must have resulted in much development and progress. When\r\nthe Nineteenth Century began, the world already enjoyed the results of\r\nHargreaves’ spinning-jenny, Arkwright’s roll-drawing spinning machine,\r\nthe mule spinner, the cotton gin, and the power loom, all of which were\r\nmost radical inventions, equaling in importance, perhaps, any that have\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nPrior to the invention of the _spinning-jenny_, the loose fibre was spun\r\ninto yarns and thread by hand on the old-fashioned spinning wheel, each\r\nthread requiring the attention of one person. In 1763 Hargreaves\r\ninvented the spinning-jenny (see Fig. 285), in which a multiplicity of\r\nspindles was employed, whereby one person could attend to the making of\r\nmany threads simultaneously. For this purpose the spindles were set\r\nupright at the end of the frame, and the rovings or strips of untwisted\r\nfibre were carried on bobbins on the inclined frame. The rovings\r\nextended from these bobbins to a reciprocating “clasp” held in the left\r\nhand of the workman, and thence extended to the spindles at the end of\r\nthe frame. The workman drew out the rovings by moving the clasp back and\r\nforth, and at the same time turned the crank with his right hand to\r\nrotate the spindles. Hargreaves’ machine is shown and described in his\r\nBritish patent, No. 962 of 1770.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 285.--HARGREAVES’ SPINNING JENNY.]\r\n\r\nThe next important step in spinning was the introduction of drawing\r\nrolls, which were a series of rolls running at different speeds for\r\ndrawing out or elongating the roving as it was spun into a thread. This\r\nwas mainly due to Arkwright, a contemporary of Hargreaves. The principle\r\nof the drawing rolls had been foreshadowed in the British patents of\r\nLouis Paul, No. 562, of 1738, and No. 724, of 1758, but Arkwright made\r\nthe first embodiment of it in practically useful machines, which were\r\ncovered by him in British patents No. 931, of 1769, and No. 1,111, of\r\n1775. Arkwright’s spinning machine is shown in Fig. 286, the drawing\r\nrolls being shown at the top of the figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 286.--ARKWRIGHT’S ROLL-DRAWING SPINNING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nFollowing these important inventions came the mule spinner. This was\r\ninvented by Crompton between 1774 and 1779, but was never patented. It\r\ncombined the leading features of Hargreaves and Arkwright. The spindles\r\nwere mounted on a wheeled carriage that traveled back and forth a\r\nconsiderable distance from the drawing rolls, which were mounted in\r\nbearings in a stationary frame. The long travel of the carriage back and\r\nforth, and the simultaneous twisting and drawing of the yarns, produced\r\nthreads of great fineness and regularity. The value of the long travel\r\nof the carriage may be briefly noted as follows: When the threads or\r\nslivers emerge from the drawing rolls they are not absolutely of uniform\r\nsize, and the thick portions do not twist as tightly as the thinner\r\nportions. The stretching and drawing of these thicker parts down to a\r\nuniform size by the receding of the carriage is the distinctive feature\r\nof its action. As the thread has greater tensile strength at the thinner\r\nhard-twisted parts than it has at the thicker untwisted parts, it will\r\nbe seen that the stretching action is localized on the thicker untwisted\r\nparts of the thread, which are thus brought down to uniform size by\r\nelongation. The drawing and twisting of the thread is effected as the\r\ncarriage runs out, and when the carriage runs in these twisted lengths\r\nare wound around the spindles. The rendering of the action of the mule\r\nautomatic or self-acting in its travel back and forth was the invention\r\nof Richard Roberts, of England, and was covered by him in British\r\npatents No. 5,138 of 1825, and No. 5,649 of 1830. The mule spinner shown\r\nin Fig. 287 is a good modern example of this machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 287.--MULE SPINNING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most important of the early inventions in the textile art was\r\nthe _cotton gin_. This was the invention of Eli Whitney, of\r\nMassachusetts, and was patented by him March 14, 1794. Prior to its use\r\nthe picking of the cotton fibre from the bean-like seed with which it is\r\ncompactly stored in the boll was entirely effected by hand, and it was a\r\nslow and tedious process, and about 4 pounds per day was the average\r\nwork of one man. The cotton gin, shown in Fig. 288, is a device for\r\ndoing this by machinery in a rapid, thorough, and expeditious manner.\r\nThe cotton, mixed with seed, is fed to the roll box J, in which a sort\r\nof reel F continually turns the cotton. The bottom of the roll box is\r\nformed with a grating of parallel ribs E, between which project the\r\nteeth of a gang of circular saws C, which pull the fibre through between\r\nthe ribs and deliver it to the revolving brush B, which beats the fibre\r\noff the teeth of the saws and produces a blast that discharges the\r\nfleece through the rear of the gin. The cotton seed, which are too\r\nlarge to pass between the ribs with the fibre, drop out the bottom of\r\nthe roll-box. With the aid of the cotton gin the efficiency of one man\r\nis raised from four pounds per day to several thousand pounds per day,\r\nand the culture and manufacture of cotton fibre was revolutionized and\r\ngreatly stimulated by providing a mode of putting it into merchantable\r\ncondition at a reasonable price. It is said that the crop of cotton\r\nincreased from 189,316 pounds in 1791 to 2,000,000,000 pounds in 1859.\r\nThe cotton gin, as invented by Whitney more than a hundred years ago, is\r\nstill in use, substantially unchanged in principle, but its efficiency\r\nhas been raised from 70 pounds per day to several thousands. The cotton\r\ncrop of the United States for 1899, which was handled by the modern gins\r\nat this rate, amounted to 11,274,840 bales, of about 500 pounds each, or\r\nmore than five thousand million pounds. But for the cotton gin this\r\ngreat staple would have only a very limited use, and one of the greatest\r\nof the world’s industries would have practically no existence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 288.--COTTON GIN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 289.--MODERN SPINNING SPINDLE.]\r\n\r\nA modern step of importance in spinning was the _ring frame_. Ring\r\nspinning was invented by John Thorp, of Rhode Island, who took out two\r\npatents for the same November 20, 1828. The leading feature of the ring\r\nframe is the substitution of a light steel hoop or traveler running upon\r\nthe upper edge of a ring surrounding the spindle in lieu of the flyer\r\nformerly employed. The thread passes through the hoop as it is wound\r\nupon the spindle. In modern times ring spinning has attained\r\nconsiderable proportions, especially in cotton manufactures.\r\n\r\nNearly 3,000 United States patents have been granted in the class of\r\nspinning, and many valuable improvements in the details of construction\r\nin spinning machinery have been made in recent years. The most\r\nimportant, perhaps, are those relating to spindle structure, whereby the\r\nspeed and efficiency of spinning machines have been greatly increased.\r\nPrior to 1878 the speed of the average spindle was limited to 5,000\r\nrevolutions a minute. In 1878 improvements were made which doubled its\r\nworking speed and permitted as high as 20,000 revolutions a minute. This\r\nresult was accomplished by making a yielding bolster. The bolster is an\r\nupright sleeve bearing, in which the spindle revolves, and against which\r\nis sustained the pull of the band that drives the spindle. By making\r\nthis bolster or sleeve bearing to yield laterally by means of an elastic\r\npacking which surrounds it, a much greater freedom and speed of\r\nrevolution were obtained. The preliminary step in this direction was\r\nmade by Birkenhead in patent No. 205,718, July 9, 1878. In the same year\r\nthis idea was perfected by Rabbeth. The bolster was placed loosely in a\r\nbolster case of slightly larger diameter than the bolster, and the\r\nbottom of the spindle had a free lateral movement as well as the top, as\r\nshown in his patent No. 227,129, May 4, 1880. With such perfect freedom\r\nof movement, the spindle at high speed could find its own center of\r\nrevolution, and an indefinitely high speed and quadrupled efficiency\r\nwere attained. The Draper Spindle is shown in Fig. 289 as one of the\r\nmost modern and representative of spinning spindles. Considering the\r\ngreat speed of the modern spindle and the fact that a single workman\r\nattends a thousand or more of them, the record of progress in this art\r\nbecomes impressive. In 1805 there were only 4,500 cotton spindles at\r\nwork in the United States. In 1899 there were 18,100,000.\r\n\r\n_Weaving._--A woven fabric consists of threads which run lengthwise,\r\ncalled the “warp,” crossed by threads running transversely, called the\r\n“woof,” “weft,” or “filling,” which latter are imprisoned or locked in\r\nby the warp. In a simple loom the warp threads are divided into two\r\ngroups, the threads of one group alternating with those of the other,\r\nand means are provided for separating these groups to form a\r\nwedge-shaped space between them called a “shed.” Through this shed the\r\nshuttle which carries the woof or filling thread is sent crosswise the\r\nwarp threads. Means are provided for changing the inclination and\r\nposition of the two groups of warp threads in relation to each other, so\r\nas to lock in the filling, and put the warp threads in position to\r\nreceive the next filling thread. For this purpose the warp threads,\r\nusually horizontal, are each passed through a loop, and every alternate\r\nloop is attached to a frame called a “heddle.” The intervening loops and\r\nthreads are attached to another frame or “heddle,” and the two heddles\r\nby being worked, one up and the other down, separate the warp threads to\r\nform the shed. Formerly the shuttle was thrown by hand through the shed.\r\nIn 1733 John Kay, of England, took out British patent No. 542, for the\r\nflying shuttle and picking stick, by which the shuttle was struck a\r\nhammer-like blow and driven like a ball from a bat across the warp, and\r\nwas struck by a similar stick on the other side, to be returned in the\r\nsame way. This gave a much more rapid action than could be obtained by\r\nhand-throwing, and enabled one weaver to do the work of two or three. In\r\n1760 Robert Kay invented the drop box, by which different shuttles\r\ncarrying different colors of thread were employed.\r\n\r\nThe _power loom_, however, marked the first great growth in the art of\r\nweaving. The enormously increased quantity of cotton spun by Arkwright’s\r\nmachinery made a demand for increased facilities for weaving it into\r\ncloth. Dr. Cartwright, of England, foresaw and met this demand in his\r\n_power loom_, in which all of the intricate operations were performed by\r\npower-driven machinery. His invention was not extensively introduced\r\nuntil about the beginning of the Nineteenth Century. One difficulty\r\nexperienced was that the warp threads, from their fuzzy nature, had to\r\nbe dressed with size, and this required the loom to be stopped from time\r\nto time, and necessitated the services of a man to dress or size the\r\nwarp threads. This difficulty was overcome, however, by Johnson &\r\nRadcliffe, about 1803, by the sizing and dressing of the yarns by\r\npassing them between rollers and coating them with a thin layer of paste\r\nbefore being put into the loom. Dr. Cartwright was granted British\r\npatents No. 1,470, of 1785; No. 1,565, of 1786; No. 1,616, of 1787, and\r\nNo. 1,676, of 1788, but being unable to maintain any monopoly under his\r\npatents he was compensated by Parliament with a grant of £10,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 290.--MODERN JACQUARD LOOM.]\r\n\r\n_Jacquard Loom._--This most notable step in the art of weaving was made\r\nat the very beginning of the Nineteenth Century. It enabled all kinds of\r\nfabrics, from the finest to the coarsest, to be cheaply woven into\r\npatterns having figured or ornamental designs. Jacquard, a native of\r\nLyons, conceived the plan of his great invention in the last decade of\r\nthe Eighteenth Century, and on December 28, 1801, took out French patent\r\nNo. 245, on the same. His invention was not, in fact, a new form of\r\nloom, but rather an attachment to a loom which was universally\r\napplicable to all looms. Before his invention, figured patterns of cloth\r\ncould only be made by slow and laborious processes. Jacquard’s invention\r\nconsisted in individualizing and differentiating the movement of the\r\nwarp threads, instead of operating them in constant groups. This\r\nindividualizing of the movement of the warp threads allowed any warp\r\nthread to be held up automatically any length of time, or let down,\r\naccording as was necessary to form the figure of the pattern. This was\r\naccomplished by making a chain of articulated cards, like a slatted\r\nbelt, and perforating these cards with varying arrangements of holes.\r\nThe cards were successively and intermittently fed to a set of needles,\r\nwhich latter, by rising and falling, raise or lower the warp threads\r\nattached to the same. By perforating these cards differently, and\r\narranging them so that when one card was brought in front of the needles\r\nit would let certain needles through the perforations and hold the\r\nothers back, it will be seen that each card controlled the action of a\r\ndifferent set of needles, and the sequence of the series of cards\r\neffected the necessary change in the needles and movement of the warp\r\nthreads to form the growth of the figure in the fabric.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 290 is seen a modern form of Jacquard loom, showing at the far\r\nend the chain of perforated cards. Jacquard received a bronze medal at\r\nthe French Exposition in 1801, was decorated with the Cross of the\r\nLegion of Honor, and the gratitude of his countrymen was attested by a\r\npension of 6,000 francs, and a statue erected to his memory at Lyons in\r\n1840.\r\n\r\nSubsequent improvements and developments of the Jacquard loom have\r\ncarried its work to great nicety and refinement of action. In the chain\r\nof pattern cards it is said that as many as 25,000 separately punched\r\ncards or plates are sometimes used in weaving a single yard of brocade.\r\nThe great variety of elaborate designs of delicate tracery in silk, rich\r\npatterns in brocades, and gorgeous figures in carpets, attest the value\r\nof Jacquard’s important step in this art.\r\n\r\nNearly 5,000 United States patents have been granted in the class of\r\nweaving. In the early part of the century much notable work was done.\r\nSteam was applied to looms by William Horrocks (British patent No.\r\n2,699, 1803). From 1830 to 1842 there were brought out the fancy looms\r\nof Crompton, the application of the Jacquard mechanism to the lace frame\r\nby Draper, and the carpet looms of Bigelow. In 1853 Bonelli sought to\r\nimprove on the Jacquard mechanism by employing electro-magnets to effect\r\nthe selection of the needles, instead of perforated cards (British\r\npatent No. 1,892, of 1853).\r\n\r\nAmong more recent developments is the _Positive Motion_ loom of Lyall,\r\npatented December 10, 1872, No. 133,868, re-issue No. 9,049, January 20,\r\n1880. The distinguishing feature of this is that the shuttle is not\r\nthrown or impelled as a projectile through the wedge-shaped space\r\n(shed), between the two sets of warp threads, but is positively dragged\r\nback and forth through the same by an endless belt attached to the\r\nshuttle carriage and running first in one direction and then in the\r\nother to drag the shuttle through.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 291.--CROMPTON FANCY LOOM.]\r\n\r\nIt is not to be understood that the positive motion loom has superseded\r\nthe flying shuttle. The latter is still the leading type, of which the\r\nCrompton fancy loom, shown in Fig. 291, is a representative\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nThe tendency in late years in the art of weaving has been toward\r\nlabor-saving devices, a reduction in the cost to the consumer of all\r\nkinds of textile fabrics, and the extension of the loom to the weaving\r\nof new kinds of materials. Prominent among these are the inventions in\r\nthe loom for weaving plain fabrics made between the years 1881 and 1895,\r\nshown in patents to Northrop, No. 454,810, June 23, 1891; No. 529,943,\r\nNovember 27, 1894, and Draper, No. 536,948, April 2, 1895. This loom, as\r\nusual, employs a single shuttle, but as the weft becomes exhausted\r\nanother bobbin is automatically supplied to the shuttle without\r\nstopping the operation of the machine. During the year 1895 the first\r\nloom for weaving an open mesh cane fabric having diagonal strands was\r\ninvented. Patents to Morris, No. 549,930, and to Crompton, No. 550,068,\r\nNovember 19, 1895, were obtained for this. Prior to this time two\r\ndistinct machines were necessary to produce this fabric, and the\r\noperation was slow and expensive. Between 1893 and 1895 two machines\r\nwere invented, upon either of which the well-known Turkish carpets can\r\nbe woven. Patents to Youngjohns, No. 510,755, December 12, 1893, and to\r\nReinhart von Seydlitz, No. 533,330, January 29, 1895, disclose this. The\r\ndrawing of warp threads into the eyes of the heddles and through the\r\nreed of a loom requires great skill, and prior to 1880 was performed by\r\nhand at great expense. In 1882, however, a machine for doing this was\r\ninvented, thereby dispensing with the old hand method and cheapening the\r\noperation. Patents to Sherman and Ingersoll, No. 255,038, March 14,\r\n1882, and Ingersoll, No. 461,613, October 20, 1891, were granted for\r\nthis machine.\r\n\r\nTo-day the shuttle flies at the rate of 180 to 250 strokes a minute, and\r\nyet the complex organization of the machine works with an energy, a\r\nuniformity, an accuracy and a continuity that leaves far behind the\r\nstrength of the arm, the memory of mind, and the accuracy of the human\r\neye, and yet, if the tiny thread breaks, the whole organization\r\ninstantly stops and patiently waits the remedial care of its watchful\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n_Knitting Machines._--Knitting differs from weaving, braiding, or\r\nplaiting in the following respects: In weaving there are longitudinal\r\nthreads called warp threads, which are crossed on a separate weft or\r\nfilling thread. In braiding or plaiting all the threads may be\r\nconsidered warp threads, since they are arranged to run longitudinally,\r\nand instead of locking around a separate transverse thread at right\r\nangles, they extend diagonally and are interwoven with each other. In\r\nnetting and knitting, however, there is but a single thread, which, in\r\nnetting, is knotted into itself at definite intervals to leave a mesh of\r\ndefinite size, while in knitting the single thread is merely looped into\r\nitself without any definite mesh. Knitted goods have the peculiarity of\r\ngreat elasticity in consequence of this formation of the fabric, and for\r\nthat reason find a special application in all garments which are\r\nrequired to snugly conform to irregular outlines, such as stockings for\r\nthe feet, gloves for the hands, and underwear for the body.\r\n\r\nWeaving, braiding, and netting are very old arts, but the art of\r\nknitting is comparatively modern. It is believed to have originated\r\nabout the year 1500 in Scotland. In 1589 William Lee, of England, is\r\ncredited with making the first knitting machine. It is said that the\r\ngirl with whom he was in love, and to whom he was paying his attention,\r\nwas so busy with her work of hand knitting that she could not give him\r\nthe requisite attention, and he invented the knitting machine that they\r\nmight have more time to devote to their love affairs. Another version is\r\nthat he married the girl and invented the machine to relieve her weary\r\nfingers from the work of the knitting needle, and still another is that\r\nthe machine was the leading object of his affections, to the neglect of\r\nhis sweetheart, who “gave him the mitten” before he had knitted one on\r\nhis machines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 292.--BRANSON 15/16 AUTOMATIC KNITTER.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest circular knitting machine was by Brunel, described in\r\nBritish patent No. 3,993, of 1816. Power was applied to the knitting\r\nframe by Bailey in 1831, and the latch needle was patented in the United\r\nStates by Hibbert, January 9, 1849, No. 6,025. This patent was extended\r\nfor seven years from January 9, 1863, and covered a very important and\r\nuniversally used feature of the knitting machine. Research has shown,\r\nhowever, that the latch was not broadly new with Hibbert, as it appeared\r\nin the French patent to Jeandeau, No. 1,900, of April 25, 1806. Among\r\nthe earlier knitting machines, the straight reciprocating type was most\r\nin evidence, and of which the Lamb machine was a popular form. The\r\nincreased speed and capacity of the circular machine have, however,\r\ncaused it to largely supersede the others. In the circular machine a\r\ncircular series of vertical parallel needles slide in grooves in a\r\ncylinder, and are raised and lowered successively by an external\r\nrotating cylinder which has on the inner side cams that act upon the\r\nneedles. The Branson 15/16 Automatic Knitter, shown in Fig. 292, is a\r\ngood modern illustration. It performs automatically fifteen-sixteenths\r\nof the various movements which ordinarily would be performed by hand on\r\na hand machine. Its salient features are covered by patents No. 333,102,\r\nDecember 29, 1885, and No. 519,170, May 1, 1894. About 2,000 United\r\nStates patents have been granted in the class of knitting and netting,\r\nand the value of hosiery and knit goods in the United States in 1890 was\r\n$67,241,013.\r\n\r\nAn important branch of the textile art is cloth finishing, whereby the\r\nrough surface of the cloth as it comes from the loom is rendered soft\r\nand smooth. One method is to raise the nap of the cloth by pulling out\r\nthe fibre by a multitude of fine points. Originally this was done by\r\ncombing it with teasles, a sort of dried burr of vegetable growth,\r\nhaving a multitude of fine hook-shaped points. Machines with fine metal\r\ncard teeth are now largely used for this purpose, and of which the\r\nplanetary napping machine of Ott, patent No. 344,981, July 6, 1886, is\r\nan example. Another method of finishing the cloth is to iron or press\r\nit. Plate presses were first used in which smooth plates were folded in\r\nalternate layers with the cloth and pressure then applied, but in later\r\nyears continuous rotary presses have been employed, that of Gessner,\r\npatent No. 206,718, August 6, 1878, re-issue No. 9,076, 9,077, February\r\n17, 1880, is one of the earliest examples of a continuous rotary press.\r\nThe old Gessner presses of Saxony were the pioneers in this field. A\r\nmodern Gessner cloth press is seen in Fig. 293.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 293.--MODERN “GESSNER” CLOTH PRESSING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nIn the field of textiles there are many related arts and machines. There\r\nare hat felting and finishing machines, darning machines, quilting\r\nmachines, embroidering machines, processes and apparatus for dyeing and\r\nsizing, machines for printing fabrics, machines for making rope and\r\ncord, machines for winding and working silk, and in treating the raw\r\nmaterial there are cotton-pickers, cotton baling presses, cotton openers\r\nand cleaners, flax brakes and hackling machines, feeding devices, wool\r\ncarding and cleaning apparatus, all in variety and numbers that defy\r\nboth comment and count.\r\n\r\nIn fabrics every class of fibre has been called into requisition. Flax,\r\nwool, silk, and cotton have been supplemented with the fibres of metal,\r\nof glass, of cocoanut, pine needles, ramie, wood-pulp, and of many other\r\nplants, leaves and grasses.\r\n\r\n_Artificial silk_ is made out of a chemically prepared composition, and\r\nthe fibres are spun by processes simulating not only the act of the\r\nsilkworm, but its product in quality. Vandura silk was spun from an\r\naqueous solution of gelatine by forcing it through a fine capillary\r\ntube, but it attained little or no practical value. A far more important\r\nartificial silk is covered by the patents to De Chardonnet, No.\r\n394,559, December 18, 1888; No. 460,629, October 6, 1891, and No.\r\n531,158, December 18, 1894, and also in subsequent patents to Lehner and\r\nto Turk. These all relate to the manufacture of artificial silk by\r\nspinning threads or filaments from pyroxiline (solution of gun cotton),\r\ncollodion, or some such glutinous solution which evaporates rapidly,\r\nleaving a tiny thread, having most of the characteristics of silk and\r\nproduced by the same method employed by the silk worm when it expresses\r\nand draws out its viscid liquid. The De Chardonnet artificial silk took\r\na “Grand Prix” at the Paris Exposition in 1889, and the industry is\r\ngrowing to considerable proportions. Large works are in operation at\r\nBesançon, in France, producing 7,000 pounds per week, and it is said\r\nthat the plant is to be increased to a capacity of 2,000 pounds a day.\r\nSimilar works at Avon, near Coventry, England, have an equal capacity,\r\nand other factories are about to be established in Belgium and Germany.\r\n\r\n_Polished_ or _diamond cotton_ is a lustrous looking article of a soft\r\nsilky nature, formed by plating the threads with a liquid emulsion of a\r\nwaxy and starchy substance, and polishing the threads with rapidly\r\nrevolving brushes.\r\n\r\n_Mercerized Cloth._--In late years a distinct novelty has appeared on\r\nthe shelves of the dry goods stores. Beautiful, filmy fabrics, and\r\nlustrous embroidery thread, not of silk, but so close to it in\r\nappearance as to be scarcely distinguishable, have gained much\r\npopularity and attained a large sale. They are known as _mercerized_\r\ngoods. About the middle of the century John Mercer, of England, found\r\nthat when cotton goods were treated with chemicals (either alkalies or\r\nacids), a change was produced in the fibre which caused it to shrink and\r\nbecome thicker, and which imparted also an increased affinity for dyes.\r\nHe took out British patent No. 13,296, of 1850, for his invention, but\r\npractically nothing further was done with the process. Recently the\r\nimportant step of Thomas and Prevost of mercerizing under tension gave\r\nsome new and wonderful results. United States patents No. 600,826 and\r\nNo. 600,827, of May 15, 1898, disclose this process. The cloth or\r\nthread, while being treated chemically, is at the same time subjected to\r\na powerful tension that causes the fibres (softened and rendered\r\nglutinous by the chemicals) to be elongated or pulled out like fibres of\r\nmolten glass, giving it the same striated texture and fine luster that\r\nsilk has, and by substantially the same mechanical agency, for it is the\r\nelongation of the plastic glutinous thread from the silk worm that gives\r\nthe thread its silky luster, by a process which has a familiar\r\nillustration in the molecular adjustment that imparts luster to spun\r\nglass or drawn taffy.\r\n\r\nStanding in the light of the Twentieth Century, and looking back through\r\npast ages, we find the art of spinning and weaving in an ever present\r\nand unbroken thread of evidence all along the path of history--through\r\nwars and famine, floods and conflagrations; through the progress and\r\ndecay of nations, through all phases of change, and the vicissitudes of\r\ncenturies, it has never been relegated to the domain of the lost arts,\r\nbut has remained a persisting invention. It has been a paramount\r\nnecessity to the human race, indissolubly locked up with its continuity\r\nand welfare, and will ever continue to supply its work in maintaining\r\nthe greater fabric of human existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nICE MACHINES.\r\n\r\n    GENERAL PRINCIPLES--FREEZING MIXTURES--PERKINS’ ICE MACHINE, 1834--\r\n    PICTET’S APPARATUS--CARRÉ’S AMMONIA ABSORPTION PROCESS--DIRECT\r\n    COMPRESSION AND CAN SYSTEM--THE HOLDEN ICE MACHINE--SKATING RINKS--\r\n    WINDHAUSEN’S APPARATUS FOR COOLING AND VENTILATING SHIPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery few people have any correct conception of the principles of\r\nice-making. Most persons have heard in a vague sort of way that\r\nchemicals are employed in its manufacture, and many a fastidious\r\nindividual has been known to object to artificial ice on the ground that\r\nhe could taste the chemicals, and that it could not therefore be\r\nwholesome. Such is the power of imagination, and such the misconception\r\nin the public mind. Nothing could be more erroneous, nor more amusing to\r\nthe physicist, since no chemicals ever come in contact with either the\r\nwater or the ice. An intelligent understanding of the operations of an\r\nice machine involves only a correct appreciation of one of the physical\r\nlaws governing the relation of heat to matter, and the forms which\r\nmatter assumes under different degrees of heat. We see water passing\r\nfrom solid ice to liquid water and gaseous steam, by a mere rise in\r\ntemperature, and conversely, by abstraction of heat, steam passes back\r\nto water, and then to ice.\r\n\r\nWhen one’s hands get wet they get cold. A commonplace, but convenient\r\nproof of this is to wet the finger in the mouth and hold it in the air.\r\nA sensible reduction of temperature is instantly noticeable. A more\r\npronounced illustration is to wet the hands in a basin of water, and\r\nthen plunge them in the blast of hot, dry air coming from a furnace\r\nregister. Instead of warming the hands, as many would suppose, this\r\nwill, as long as the hands are wet, produce a distinct sensation of\r\nincreased cold. It is due to rapid evaporation, which in changing the\r\nwater from a liquid to a gaseous form, abstracts heat from the hands.\r\n\r\nEvaporation may be effected in two ways. The common one is by applying\r\nextraneous heat, as under a tea kettle, in which case the evaporated\r\nvapor is hot by virtue of the heat absorbed from the fire. The other way\r\nis to reduce pressure or produce a partial vacuum over the liquid\r\nwithout any application of heat, in which case the vapor is made cold.\r\nAs early as 1755 Dr. Cullen observed this, and discovered that the cold\r\nthus produced was sufficient to make ice. An incident of evaporation is\r\nthe passing from the limited volume of a liquid to the greatly increased\r\nvolume of a gas. Water, for instance, when it changes to a vapor,\r\nincreases in volume about 1,700 times; that is, a cubic inch of water\r\nmakes about a cubic foot of steam, and when evaporation takes place from\r\na reduction of pressure, this involves a dissipation of heat throughout\r\nthe increased volume, and the corresponding production of cold. When,\r\nhowever, matter changes from a liquid to a gas, or from a solid to a\r\nliquid, a peculiar phenomenon manifests itself, in that a great amount\r\nof heat is absorbed and, so far as the evidence of the senses goes,\r\ndisappears in the mere change of state. It is called _latent heat_. In\r\nsuch case the heat becomes hidden from the senses by being converted\r\ninto some other form of intermolecular force not appreciable as sensible\r\nheat, and producing no elevation of temperature. In illustration, if a\r\npound of water at 212° F. be mixed with a pound of water at 34° (both\r\nbeing matter in the same state), there results two pounds of water at\r\nthe mean temperature of 123°. If, however, a pound of water at 212° be\r\nmixed with a pound of _ice_ at 32° (matter in another state), there will\r\nnot be two pounds of water at the mean temperature of 122°, as might be\r\nexpected, but two pounds at 51° only, an amount of heat sufficient to\r\nraise two pounds of water 71° being absorbed in the mere change of ice\r\nto water without any sensible raise in temperature. This absorbed heat\r\nis called latent heat, and it plays an important part in artificial\r\nfreezing. A familiar illustration of the absorption of heat in changing\r\nfrom a solid to a liquid is found in the admixture of salt and ice\r\naround an ice-cream freezer. These two solids, when brought together,\r\nliquefy rapidly with an absorption of heat that produces in a limited\r\ntime a far greater degree of cold than that which could be obtained from\r\nthe ice by mere conduction, since the reduction of temperature proceeds\r\nfaster by liquefaction than can be compensated for by the absorption of\r\nheat from the air. Were this not true, ice cream could not be frozen by\r\na mixture of salt and ice. Many such freezing mixtures are known, and a\r\nfew have been made commercially available, but they cannot be\r\neconomically employed in ice-making, and it is therefore only necessary\r\nto consider the development of the more common principle of evaporation\r\nand expansion, in which the change from a liquid to a gas occurs. The\r\nvolatile liquid which was first employed was water, but as it did not\r\nvaporize as readily as some other liquids, more volatile substitutes\r\nwere soon found, among which may be named ether, ammonia, liquid\r\ncarbonic acid, liquid sulphurous acid, bisulphide of carbon and\r\nchymogene, which latter is a petroleum product lighter and more volatile\r\nthan benzine or gasoline. As these liquids were expensive, it is obvious\r\nthat their vaporization could not be allowed to take place in the open\r\nair, since the reagent would thus be quickly dissipated and lost, and\r\nhence means were devised to condense and save this valuable volatile\r\nliquid to be used over again. The vaporization of the volatile liquid to\r\nproduce cold, and its re-condensation to liquid form to be used over\r\nagain in an endless cycle of circulation, seems to have been first\r\neffected by Mr. Perkins, of England, whose British patent No. 6,662, of\r\n1834, affords a simple and clear illustration of the fundamental\r\nprinciples of most modern ice machines. His apparatus is shown in Fig.\r\n294. A tank _a_ is filled with water to be frozen or cooled. A\r\nrefrigerating chamber _b_, submerged in the water, is charged internally\r\nwith some volatile liquid, such as ether. When the piston of suction\r\npump _c_ rises a partial vacuum is formed beneath it, and the volatile\r\nliquid in _b_ being relieved of pressure, evaporates and expands into\r\ngreater volume, the vapor passing out through pipe _f_ and upwardly\r\nopening valve _e_. This vapor is rendered intensely cold by expansion,\r\nand this cold is imparted to the water in tank _a_ to freeze it. A more\r\nscientific statement, however, is that the cold vapor absorbs the heat\r\nunits of the water, and taking them away with it, lowers the temperature\r\nof the water to the freezing point. When the piston of pump _c_\r\ndescends, valve _e_ closes, and the vapor, laden with the heat units\r\nabsorbed from the water, is forced through the downwardly opening valve\r\n_e′_, and through pipe _g_ to a cooling coil _d_, around which a body of\r\ncold water is continually flowed. This water, in turn, takes the heat\r\nunits from the vapor, and passes off with them in a constant flow, while\r\nthe vapor of ether is condensed into a liquid again by the cold water,\r\nand passing through a weighted valve _h_, goes into the evaporating or\r\nrefrigerating chamber to be again vaporized in an endless circuit of\r\nflow. It will be seen that the heat units from the water in tank _a_ are\r\nfirst handed over to the cold ether vapors passing out from chamber _b_,\r\nand by this vapor are then transferred to the flowing body of water\r\nsurrounding the coil _d_. The result is that the heat units carried off\r\nby the water flowing around coil _d_ are the same heat units abstracted\r\nfrom the water in tank _a_, which water is thus reduced to congealation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 294.--PERKINS’ ICE MACHINE, 1834.]\r\n\r\nAmong later ice machines of this type the Pictet machine was a\r\nconspicuous example. This employed anhydrous sulphurous acid as the\r\nvolatile agent, and is described in United States patent No. 187,413,\r\nFebruary 13, 1877; French patent No. 109,003, of 1875.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 295.--THE PICTET ICE MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 295 is represented a vertical longitudinal and also a vertical\r\ntransverse section of a Pictet ice machine. A is a double acting suction\r\nand compression pump, D and E are two cylinders which are similarly\r\nconstructed in the respect that they are both provided with flue pipes\r\nand heads for a double circulation of fluids, one fluid passing through\r\nthe pipes while the other passes through the spaces between the pipes,\r\nmuch like the condenser of a steam engine. The cylinder D is the\r\nrefrigerator where the volatile liquid is evaporated to produce cold,\r\nand the cylinder E is the condenser where the gasified vapor is cooled\r\nand condensed again to liquid form to be returned to the refrigerator.\r\nThe action is as follows: The pump A by pipe B draws from the chamber in\r\nthe refrigerator D containing the volatile liquid, causing it to\r\nevaporate and produce an intense degree of cold which is imparted to the\r\nliquid surrounding it and filling the tank. This liquid is either brine,\r\nor a mixture of glycerine and water, or a solution of chloride of\r\nmagnesium, or other liquid which does not freeze at a temperature\r\nconsiderably below the freezing point of water. Now, this\r\nnon-congealable liquid being below the freezing point, it will be seen\r\nthat if cans H be filled with pure water, and are immersed in this\r\nintensely cold non-congealable liquid, the water in the cans will\r\nfreeze. This is exactly what takes place, and this is how the ice is\r\nformed. As the volatile liquid is drawn out of the refrigerator D\r\nthrough pipe B by the pump A it is forced by the pump through pipe C and\r\ninto the chamber of the condenser E. A current of cold water is kept\r\nflowing around the pipes in E, coming in through a pipe at one end and\r\npassing out through a pipe at the other end. The compressed and\r\nrelatively hot gases are by the contact of this cold water along the\r\nsides of the pipes cooled and condensed into a liquid again, which\r\npasses up the small curved pipe F and is returned to the refrigerator D,\r\nto be again evaporated by the suction of the pump to continue the\r\nproduction of cold. In large plants the non-congealable liquid and cans\r\nof water to be frozen are (in order to get larger capacity) carried to a\r\nlarge floor tank in a removed situation.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest methods of producing ice in a limited quantity was\r\nby evaporating water by a reduction of pressure and causing the vapor to\r\nbe absorbed by sulphuric acid, which has a great affinity for the water\r\nvapor. Mr. Nairne, in 1777, was the first to discover the affinity that\r\nsulphuric acid had for water vapor, and in 1810 Leslie froze water by\r\nthis means. In 1824 Vallance obtained British patents No. 4,884 and\r\n5,001, operating on this principle, in which leaden balls were coated\r\nwith sulphuric acid to increase the absorbing surfaces, and which\r\napparatus was effective in freezing considerable quantities of ice.\r\n\r\nThe _carafes frappees_ of the Parisian restaurant were decanters in\r\nwhich water was frozen by being immersed in tanks of sea water whose\r\ntemperature was reduced below freezing by the vaporization of ether in a\r\nreservoir immersed in the sea water. Edmond Carré’s method of preparing\r\n_carafes frappees_ involved the use of the sulphuric acid principle of\r\nabsorption, and to that end the aqueous vapor was directly exhausted\r\nfrom the decanter by a pump, and the said vapor was absorbed by a large\r\nvolume of sulphuric acid so rapidly as to freeze the water remaining in\r\nthe decanter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 296.--COMPRESSION PUMPS OF ICE PLANT.]\r\n\r\nProbably the earliest practical ice machine to be organized on a\r\ncommercial basis was the _ammonia absorption machine_ of Ferdinand\r\nCarré, which was a continuously working machine. It is disclosed in\r\nFrench patents Nos. 81 and 404, of 1860, and No. 75,702, of 1867; United\r\nStates patent No. 30,201, October 2, 1860. In this case advantage is\r\ntaken first of the very volatile character of anhydrous ammonia, in the\r\nexpansion part of the process, and, secondly, of the great affinity\r\nwhich water has for absorbing such gas. Strange as it may appear, the\r\nproduction of ice in the Carré process begins with the application of\r\nheat. It must be understood, however, that this forms no part of the\r\nrefrigerating process proper, but only a means of driving off or\r\ndistilling the anhydrous ammonia gas (the refrigerant) from its aqueous\r\nsolution. Ammonia dissolved in water, known as aqua ammonia, is placed\r\nin a boiler or still above a furnace. The pure ammonia gas is thus\r\ndriven off from the water by heat under pressure, similar to that in a\r\nsteam boiler, and passes direct to a condenser, where, by cold water\r\nflowing through pipes, the pure gas is liquefied under pressure. The\r\nliquefied gas is then admitted to the evaporating or refrigerating\r\nchamber, where it expands to produce the cold, and is afterward\r\nre-absorbed by the water from which it was originally driven off in the\r\nstill, to be used over again. Machines of this type are known as\r\nabsorption machines, for the reason that the volatile gas is after\r\nexpansion re-absorbed by the liquid in which it was dissolved, and is\r\ncontinuously driven off therefrom by the heat of a still. Absorption\r\nmachines were the outgrowth of Faraday’s observations in 1823. A bent\r\nglass tube was prepared containing at one end a quantity of chloride of\r\nsilver, saturated with ammonia and hermetically sealed. When the mixture\r\nwas heated, the ammonia was driven over to the other end of the tube,\r\nimmersed in a cold bath, and the ammonia gas became liquefied. It was\r\nfound by him then that if the end containing the chloride was plunged in\r\na cold bath and the end containing liquid ammonia was immersed in water,\r\nthe heat of the water made the ammonia rapidly evaporate, the chloride\r\nat the other end of the tube absorbed the ammonia vapors, and the water\r\naround the end of the tube containing the liquefied ammonia was\r\nconverted into ice, by the loss of its heat imparted to the ammonia to\r\nvolatilize it. It only needed the substitution of water for the chloride\r\nof silver, as an absorbing agent for the ammonia, and mechanical means\r\nfor economically working the process in a continuous way to produce the\r\nCarré absorption machine. The most common form of ice machine to-day is,\r\nhowever, what is known as the _compression_ or _direct_ system, in which\r\nthe absorption principle is dispensed with, the ammonia being compressed\r\nby powerful steam pumps, then cooled to liquid form by condensers, and\r\nthen allowed to expand from its own pressure through pipes immersed in\r\nbrine in a large floor tank, in which cans containing pure water are\r\nimmersed, and the water frozen. Fig. 296[5] shows the compression pumps,\r\nand Fig. 297 the floor tanks, of such a system. Many hundred cans\r\nfilled with pure water are lowered into the cold brine of the tank, and\r\ntheir upper ends form a complete floor, as seen in Fig. 297. When the\r\nwater in the cans is frozen, the cans are raised out of the floor by a\r\ntraveling crane and carried to one of the four doors seen at the far end\r\nof the room. The ice in the can is then loosened by warm water, and the\r\nblock dumped through the door into a chute, whence it passes into the\r\nstorage room below, seen in Fig. 298. In the can system the water is\r\nfrozen from all four sides to the center, and imprisons in the center\r\nany air bubbles or impurities that may exist in the water. The plate\r\nsystem freezes the water on the exterior walls of hollow plates, which\r\ncontain within them the freezing medium. In freezing the water\r\nexternally on these plates all impurities and air bubbles are repelled\r\nand excluded, and the ice rendered clear and transparent.\r\n\r\n  [5] By courtesy of “Ice and Refrigeration.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 297.--FLOOR TANK OF CAN SYSTEM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 298.--STORAGE ROOM OF ICE PLANT.]\r\n\r\nAn ice plant, employing what is known as the “can” system and capable of\r\nproducing 100 tons of ice in twenty-four hours, requires a building\r\nabout 100 feet wide and 150 feet long, on account of the great floor\r\nspace needed to accommodate the freezing tank, and the great number of\r\ncans which are immersed in the same. A radical departure from this style\r\nof plant is presented in the Holden ice machine. This does not require a\r\nmultitude of cans and a great floor space, but a lot 25 by 50 feet is\r\nsufficient, for the ice is turned out in a continuous process like\r\nbricks from a brick machine. The machine works on the ammonia absorption\r\nprinciple, but the freezing is done on the outer periphery of a\r\nrevolving cylinder, from which the film of ice is scraped off\r\nautomatically and the ice slush carried away by a spiral conveyor to one\r\nof two press molds, in which a heavy pressure solidifies the ice into\r\nblocks, which are successively shot down from the presses on a chute to\r\nthe storage room, as seen in Fig. 299.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 299.--HOLDEN ICE MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing examples of ice machines give no idea of the great\r\nactivity in this field of refrigeration in the Nineteenth Century. Over\r\n600 United States patents have been granted for ice machines alone, to\r\nsay nothing of refrigerating buildings, refrigerator cars, domestic\r\nrefrigerators, and ice cream freezers, etc. Among the earlier workers in\r\nice machines, in addition to those already named, may be mentioned the\r\nnames of Gorrie, patent No. 8,080, May 6, 1851, followed by Twining,\r\n1853-1862; Mignon and Rouart, in 1865; Lowe, in 1867; Somes, in\r\n1867-1868; Windhausen, in 1870; Rankin, in 1876-1877, and many others.\r\n\r\nAn application of the ice machine which attracted much attention and\r\nattained great popularity for a while was that made in the production of\r\nartificial _skating rinks_, in which a floor of ice was frozen by means\r\nof a system of submerged pipes, through which the cold liquid from the\r\nice machine was made to circulate. The earliest artificial skating rink\r\nis to be found in the British patent to Newton, No. 236, of 1870, but\r\nit was Gamgee, in 1875 and 1876, who devised practical means for\r\ncarrying it out and brought it into public use. His inventions are\r\ndescribed in his British patents No. 4,412, of 1875, and No. 4,176, of\r\n1876, and United States patent. No. 196,653, October 30, 1877, and\r\nothers in 1878.\r\n\r\nThe Windhausen machine was one of the earliest applications for\r\n_cooling_ and _ventilating_ ships. This machine operated upon the\r\nprinciple of alternately compressing and expanding air, and is described\r\nin United States patents No. 101,198, March 22, 1870 (re-issue No.\r\n4,603, October 17, 1871), and No. 111,292, January 24, 1871. To-day\r\nevery ocean liner is equipped with its own cold storage and ice-making\r\nplant, refrigerator cars transport vast cargoes of meats, fish, etc.,\r\nacross the continent, and bring the ripe fruits of California to the\r\nEastern coast; every market house has its cold storage compartments, and\r\nto the brewery the refrigerating plant is one of its fundamental and\r\nimportant requisites.\r\n\r\nThe great value of refrigerating appliances is to be found in the\r\nretardation of chemical decomposition or arrest of decay, and as this\r\nhas relation chiefly to preserving the food stuffs of the world, its\r\nvalue can be easily understood. This branch of industry has grown up\r\nentirely in the Nineteenth Century, and the activity in this field is\r\nattested by the 4,000 United States patents in this class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nLIQUID AIR.\r\n\r\n    LIQUEFACTION OF GASES BY NORTHMORE, 1805; FARADAY, 1823; BUSSY,\r\n    1824; THILORIER, 1834, AND OTHERS--LIQUEFACTION OF OXYGEN, NITROGEN\r\n    AND AIR BY PICTET AND CAILLETET IN 1877--SELF-INTENSIFICATION OF\r\n    COLD BY SIEMENS IN 1857, AND WINDHAUSEN IN 1870--OPERATIONS OF\r\n    DEWAR, WROBLEWSKI, AND OLSZEWSKI--SELF-INTENSIFYING PROCESSES OF\r\n    SOLVAY, TRIPLER, LINDÉ, HAMPSON, AND OSTERGREN AND BERGER--LIQUID\r\n    AIR EXPERIMENTS AND USES.\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil quite recently the physicist divided gaseous matter into\r\ncondensable vapors and permanent vapors. To-day it is known that there\r\nare no permanent gases, since all the so-called permanent gases, even to\r\nthe most tenuous, such as hydrogen, may be made to assume the liquid and\r\neven the solid form. The average individual knows very little about\r\nhydrogen, but he is very well acquainted with air, and when he was told\r\nthat the air that he breathes--the gentle zephyr that blows--the wind\r\nthat storms from the north, or twists itself into the rage of a cyclone\r\nin Kansas--may be bound down in liquid form, and imprisoned within the\r\nlimits of an open tumbler, or be bottled up in a flask or even frozen\r\nsolid, he was at first impressed with the suspicion of a fairy story.\r\nSeeing is believing, however, to him, and the striking experiments from\r\nthe lecture platform, the approval of the scientists, and the\r\nsensational accounts of it in the press, have not only been convincing,\r\nbut have completely turned his head and made him a too willing victim of\r\nthe speculator. Liquid air is a real achievement, however, and while it\r\nis astonishing to the layman, the physicist looks upon it in the most\r\nmatter-of-fact way, for it is only a fulfilment of the simplest of\r\nnature’s laws, and entirely consonant with what he has been led to\r\nexpect for many years.\r\n\r\nThe liquefaction of gases has engaged the attention of the scientist\r\nalmost from the beginning of the century. In 1805-6 Northmore liquefied\r\nchlorine gas. This was done again in 1823 by Faraday. In 1824 Bussy\r\ncondensed sulphurous acid vapors to liquid form. In 1834 Thilorier made\r\nextensive experiments and demonstrations in the liquefaction of carbonic\r\nacid gas. In 1843 Aime experimented with the liquefaction of gases by\r\nsinking them in suitable vessels to great depths in the ocean. Natterer,\r\nin 1844, greatly advanced the study of this subject by both novel\r\nmethods and apparatus. Liquefaction of air was attempted as early as\r\n1823 by Perkins, and again in 1828 by Colladon, but it was not\r\naccomplished until 1877. In this year the liquefaction of oxygen, by\r\nPictet, of Geneva, and Cailletet, of Chatillon-sur-Seine, was\r\nindependently accomplished. Pictet used a pressure of 320 atmospheres\r\nand a temperature of -140°, obtained by the evaporation of liquid\r\nsulphurous acid and liquid carbonic acid. Cailletet used a pressure of\r\n300 atmospheres and a temperature of -29°, which latter was obtained by\r\nthe evaporation of liquid sulphurous acid. In 1883 Dewar, Wroblewski and\r\nOlszewski commenced operations in this field, and greatly advanced the\r\nstudy of this subject. In January of 1884, Wroblewski confirmed the\r\nliquefaction of hydrogen, which had been imperfectly accomplished by\r\nCailletet before. In the liquefaction of oxygen and nitrogen, the\r\nprincipal component gases of air, the liquefaction of air itself\r\nfollowed immediately as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nAir has usually been held to consist of four volumes of nitrogen and one\r\nvolume of oxygen, with a very small proportion of carbonic acid gas and\r\nammonia. Recent discoveries have definitely identified new gases in it,\r\nhowever, chief among which is argon. For all practical purposes,\r\nhowever, air may be considered simply a mixture of the two gases;\r\nnitrogen, which is inert and neither maintains life nor combustion; and\r\noxygen, which performs both of these functions in a most energetic way.\r\nAir is more dense at the surface of the earth, and becomes continually\r\nmore rarified as the altitude increases, until it becomes an\r\nindefinitely tenuous ether. Light as we are accustomed to regard it, the\r\nweight of a column of air one inch square is 15 pounds, and this tenuous\r\nand unfelt covering presses upon our globe with a total weight of\r\n300,000 million tons.\r\n\r\nLiquid air is simply air which has been compressed and cooled to what is\r\ncalled its critical temperature and pressure, _i. e._, the temperature\r\nand pressure at which it passes into another state of matter, as from a\r\ngas to a liquid. To liquefy air it is compressed until its volume is\r\nreduced to 1/800, that is to say, 800 cubic feet of air are reduced to\r\none cubic foot. This requires a pressure of 1,250 to 2,000 pounds to the\r\nsquare inch.\r\n\r\nThe important step in liquefying air cheaply and on a large scale was\r\naccomplished by the discovery of what is known as the\r\n_self-intensifying_ action. This dispenses with auxiliary refrigerants,\r\nand causes the expanding gases to supply the cold required for their own\r\nliquefaction by an entirely mechanical process. It consists in\r\ncompressing the air (which produces heat), then cooling it by a flowing\r\nbody of water, then passing it through a long coil of pipes and\r\nexpanding the cool compressed air by allowing it to escape through a\r\nvalve into an expansion chamber, where its pressure falls from 1,250\r\npounds to 300 pounds, which produces a great degree of cold; then taking\r\nthis very cold current of air back in reverse direction along the walls\r\nof the coil of pipes, and causing said returning cold air to further\r\ncool the air flowing from the compressor to the expansion tank, and\r\nfinally delivering the cold return flow to the compressors and\r\ncompressing it again from a lower initial point than it started with on\r\nthe first round, and so continuing this cycle of circulation through the\r\nalternating compressing and cooling stages until the air condenses in\r\nliquid form in the bottom of the expansion chamber. This successive\r\nreduction of temperature by the air acting upon itself is called\r\n_self-intensification_ of cold, and it has an analogy in the\r\nregenerative furnace, where the augmentation of heat corresponds to the\r\naugmentation of cold in the self-intensifying action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 300.--THE SELF-INTENSIFYING PRINCIPLE OF PRODUCING\r\nCOLD, USED TO LIQUEFY AIR.]\r\n\r\nThis principle of self-intensification was first announced by Prof. C.\r\nW. Siemens in the provisional specification of his British patent No.\r\n2,064, of 1857, but it does not seem at that time to have been carried\r\nout with any practical result. The first embodiment of the principle in\r\na refrigerating apparatus is by Windhausen--United States patent No.\r\n101,198, March 22, 1870. Solvay, in British patent No. 13,466, of 1885,\r\ngave further development to the idea, and following him came the\r\noperations of Prof. Tripler, who was the first to liquefy large\r\nquantities of air and to introduce it to the American people. Lindé,\r\nHampson and Ostergren and Berger are more recent operators in this field\r\nof self-intensification, and Lindé’s British patent, No. 12,528, of\r\n1895, may be regarded as a representative exposition of the principle. A\r\nsimplified form of the Lindé apparatus is seen in Fig. 300. C is an air\r\ncompressing pump, whose plunger descending compresses the air and forces\r\nit out through valve I, pipe 2, and coil 3. The coil 3 is immersed in a\r\nflowing body of water in the condenser W, the water entering at Y and\r\npassing out at Z. The cold compressed air then passes through pipes 4\r\nand 5, pipe 5 being arranged concentrically within a larger coil 7. The\r\ncold air flowing down pipe 5 escapes through a valve adjusted by handle\r\n6, into the subjacent chamber L, and expanding to a larger volume,\r\nproduces a great degree of cold; this cold expanded air then passing up\r\nthe larger and outer pipe 7 flows back over the incoming stream of air\r\nin pipe 5, chilling it still lower than the condenser W did, and this\r\ncold return flow then passing from the top of coil 7 descends through\r\npipe 8 to the compressing pump C, and as its piston rises, it enters the\r\npump through the inwardly opening valve 9, and here it undergoes another\r\ncompression and circuit through the pipes 2, 3, 4, 5, but it is\r\ncompressed on its second round of travel at a lower temperature than it\r\nhad initially, and so this circulation of air going to the chamber L,\r\nexpanding, and returning over the inlet flow pipe 5, successively\r\ncooling the latter and also successively entering the compressor at a\r\ncontinually lower temperature at each cycle of circulation, finally\r\nissues through the valve at the lower end of pipe 5, and expands to such\r\na low temperature that it condenses in chamber L in liquid form. Fresh\r\naccessions of air are furnished to the apparatus through valve 10 as\r\nfast as the air is liquefied. The inlet flow to the liquefying chamber\r\nis shown by the full line arrows, and the return flow to the compressor\r\nby the dotted arrows, and the explanation of the term\r\n_self-intensification_ is to be found in the cooling of the incoming air\r\nin pipe 5 by the outflowing air in the surrounding pipe 7, and the\r\nrepeated reductions of temperature at which the air is returned to the\r\ncompressor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 301.--COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION OF LIQUID AIR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 302.--VESSEL FOR TRANSPORTING LIQUID AIR.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 301 is shown the liquefier of a modern liquid air plant, in\r\nwhich liquid air is being drawn into a pail from the liquefier. Liquid\r\nair evaporates very rapidly, and produces the intense cold of 312° below\r\nzero. There is no known way to preserve it beyond a limited time, for,\r\nif put in strong, tightly closed vessels, it would soon absorb enough\r\nheat to vaporize, and in time would acquire a tension of 12,000 pounds\r\nper square inch, and would burst the vessel with a disastrous explosion.\r\nIf left exposed to the air, which is the only safe way to transport it,\r\nit is quickly dissipated. A shipment of eight gallons from New York to\r\nWashington for lecture purposes shrunk to three gallons in two days’\r\ntime. It may usually be kept longer than this, however, as the jarring\r\nof a railway train promotes its evaporation and loss. A small quantity,\r\nsuch as a half pint, will boil away in twenty-five to thirty minutes.\r\nThe only way to preserve it for any length of time is to surround it\r\nwith a heat-excluding jacket. The simplest and most effective means for\r\ndoing this in the laboratory is to surround it with a vacuum. Fig. 302\r\nshows a specially devised vessel for the commercial transportation of\r\nliquid air. A double walled globular vessel has between its walls air\r\nspaces and non-conducting packing. The liquid air in the interior\r\nchamber vaporizes gradually, and escaping through the outwardly opening\r\nvalve at the top, expands around the air space surrounding the inner\r\nvessel. From this space it reaches the outer air by a valve at the\r\nbottom of the outer vessel. The liquid air in evaporating is thus\r\ncarried around the body of liquid air in the center, and surrounding it\r\nwith an intensely cold envelope, prevents the transmission of heat to\r\nthe inner vessel. To withdraw the liquid air, a pipette or so-called\r\nsiphon tube, shown in detached view, is substituted for the valve at the\r\ntop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 303.--SEPARATION OF LIQUID AIR INTO ITS\r\nCONSTITUENTS.\r\n\r\nEvaporation of Nitrogen.\r\n\r\nEvaporation of Nitrous Oxide.\r\n\r\nEvaporation of Pure Oxygen.]\r\n\r\nAs to the uses of liquid air it may be said that up to the present time\r\nit has attained little or no practical application. There are two\r\nprincipal ways in which it may be utilized; one is to employ its\r\nenormous expansive force to produce mechanical power, and the other is\r\nas a refrigerant. As a means for obtaining motive power it is a fallacy\r\nto suppose that any more power can be obtained from its expansion than\r\nwas originally required to make it. It is like a resilient spring in\r\nthis respect, that it can give out no more power than was required to\r\ncompress it. In some special applications, however, as for propelling\r\ntorpedoes, where its cost is entirely subordinate to effective results,\r\nit might prove to be of value. For blasting purposes also it presents\r\nthe promise of possible utilization. As a refrigerant for commercial\r\npurposes, and for supplying a dry, cool temperature to the sick room,\r\nand for the preparation of chemicals requiring a low temperature to\r\nmanufacture, it might find useful application. Inasmuch as the nitrogen\r\nof liquid air evaporates first, and leaves nearly pure liquid oxygen, it\r\nmay also be employed as a means for producing and applying oxygen. Good\r\nillustration of this is given in Fig. 303, in which at 1 is shown a\r\nvessel filled with liquid air. The gas first evaporating is nitrogen,\r\nand a lighted match applied to the surface of the liquid is quickly\r\nextinguished, since nitrogen does not support combustion. As the level\r\nof the liquid falls by evaporation, the remaining portions become richer\r\nin oxygen and poorer in nitrogen, and nitrous oxide gas is then given\r\noff, which supports combustion as seen at 2; and when the last portions\r\nof the liquid are being evaporated, as at 3, it is practically pure\r\noxygen, which gives a brilliant combustion of a carbon pencil, or even\r\nof a steel spring when the latter is heated red hot. Already Prof.\r\nPictet has formulated a plan for the commercial production and\r\nseparation of the ingredients of liquid air--the nitrogen, carbonic\r\nacid, and oxygen being separated by their different evaporating\r\ntemperatures with a view to applying them to various industrial uses.\r\nAll of the commercial applications of liquid air, however, depend upon\r\nits cost of production, which seems at present an uncertain factor.\r\nAccording to the claims of some it may be produced at a cost of a few\r\ncents a gallon. More conservative physicists say that it costs $5 a\r\ngallon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 304.--LIQUID AIR EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\n1. Magnetism of oxygen. 2. Steel burning in liquid oxygen. 3.

Boiling liquid air.]\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the phenomena which it presents are both\r\ninteresting and instructive. In Figs. 304 and 305 are shown some of the\r\nexperiments. At No. 1 a test tube containing liquid air, from which the\r\nnitrogen has escaped, is strongly attracted by an electro-magnet,\r\nshowing the magnetic quality of oxygen. At No. 2 is shown the combustion\r\nof a heated piece of steel in liquid air, which has become rich in\r\noxygen by the evaporation of the nitrogen. At No. 3 a tin dipper, which\r\nhas been immersed in liquid air, has become so cold and crystalline that\r\nit breaks like glass when dropped. At No. 4 liquid air imprisoned in a\r\ntube and tightly corked up, blows the stopper out in a few minutes with\r\nexplosive effect. At No. 5 a piece of paper saturated with liquid air\r\nburns with great energy, and at No. 6 a piece of sponge or raw cotton\r\nsimilarly saturated explodes when ignited. At No. 7 a rubber ball\r\nfloated on liquid air in a tumbler is frozen so hard that when dropped\r\nit flies into fragments like a glass ball. The white, snow-like vapor\r\nseen falling over the edges of the tumbler is intensely cold and heavier\r\nthan ordinary air. At No. 8 is illustrated the preservation of liquid\r\nair by surrounding it with a vacuum in a Dewar bulb. At No. 9 a flask of\r\nliquid air is made to boil by the mere heat of the hand. A more striking\r\nexperiment still of the same kind is to place a tea kettle containing\r\nliquid air on a block of ice. The block of ice is relatively so much\r\nhotter than the liquid air that the liquid air in the kettle is made to\r\nboil. At No. 10, Fig. 305, a heavy weight is suspended by a link\r\ncomposed of a bar of mercury frozen solid in liquid air. So hard is the\r\nmercury frozen that a hammer made of it will drive a tenpenny nail up to\r\nits head in a pine board. In No. 11 a layer of liquid air on water at\r\nfirst floats because it is lighter than water. As the lighter nitrogen\r\nevaporates, the heavier oxygen sinks in drops through the water. At No.\r\n12 a tumbler of whiskey is frozen solid by immersing a tube containing\r\nliquid air in it. The frozen block of whiskey with the cavity formed by\r\nthe tube is shown on the left. It is a whiskey tumbler made out of\r\nwhiskey. A more sensational experiment is to substitute a tapering tin\r\ncup for the tube, then fill it with liquid air and immerse it in water.\r\nIn a few minutes the tapering tin cup has frozen on its outer walls a\r\ntumbler of ice. This may be carefully removed, and the ice tumbler is\r\nthen filled with liquid air rich in oxygen, which, by maintaining the\r\ncold of the ice tumbler, keeps it from melting. A carbon pencil or a\r\nsteel spring heated to redness will now, if dipped in the liquid oxygen\r\nin the ice tumbler, burn with vehement brilliancy and beautiful\r\nscintillations, involving the anomalous conditions of a white hot heat\r\nand active combustion in the center of a tumbler of ice, without melting\r\nthe tumbler. In experiment 13, Fig. 305, a jet of carbonic acid gas\r\ndirected into a dish floating in a glass of liquid air is immediately\r\nfrozen into minute flakes, producing a miniature snow storm of carbonic\r\nacid. In experiment 14 an electric light carbon heated to a red heat at\r\nits tip, is plunged vertically into a deep glass of liquid oxygen. A\r\nmost singular combustion takes place. The heat of the carbon evaporates\r\nthe oxygen in its immediate vicinity, and the carbon burns with great\r\nbrilliancy and violence, forming carbonic acid, which is largely frozen\r\nin the liquid before it reaches the surface, and falls back to the\r\nbottom of the dish, so that the combustion is maintained and its\r\nproducts retained within the dish. A beefsteak may be frozen in liquid\r\nair to such brittleness that it is shattered like a china plate when\r\nstruck a slight blow. The intense cold of liquid air does not destroy\r\nthe vitality or germinating power of seed, but produces serious\r\nso-called burns on the flesh that destroy the tissues and do not heal\r\nfor many months, and yet for a moment the finger may be dipped in liquid\r\nair with impunity because of the gaseous envelope with which the finger\r\nis temporarily surrounded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 305.--LIQUID AIR EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\n10.

It would be a fallacy to entertain such a\r\nthought, for the little stars out-number the big ones, and the twigs of\r\nthe tree are far more numerous than its branches. The great things in\r\nlife are comparatively few and far between, and the bulk of human\r\nexistence is made up of an unclassified mass of little things, sown like\r\nsands along the shore of time between the boulders of great events. So\r\nalso in invention is its warp and woof made up of a multitude of little\r\nthreads behind the gorgeous patterns of meteoric genius. Every hour of\r\nthe day of modern life is replete with the achievements of invention.\r\nLook around the room, and there is not a thing in sight that does not\r\nsuggest the material advance of the age; the books, the furniture, the\r\ncarpets, the curtains, the wall paper, the clock, the mantels, the house\r\ntrimmings, the culinary utensils, and the clothing, all represent\r\ncreations of this century. So full is the daily life of these things,\r\nand so much of a necessity have they all become, that their commonplace\r\ncharacter dismisses them from conspicuous notice. Take the most\r\nmatter-of-fact and prosy half hour of the day, that at the time of\r\nrising, and see what a faithful account of the average man’s everyday\r\nlife would present. The awakening is definitely determined by an alarm\r\nclock, and the sleepy Nineteenth Century man rolling over under the\r\nseductive comfort of a spring bed, takes another nap, because he knows\r\nthat the rapid transit cars will give him time to spare. Rising a little\r\nlater his bare feet find a comfortable footing on a machine-made rug,\r\nuntil thrust into full fashioned hose, and ensconced in a pair of\r\nmachine-sewed slippers. Drawing the loom-made lace curtains, he starts\r\nup the window shade on the automatic Hartshorn roller and is enabled to\r\nsee how to put in his collar button and adjust his shirt studs. He\r\nawakens the servant below with an electric bell, calls down the\r\nspeaking tube to order breakfast, and perhaps lights the gas for her by\r\nthe push button. He then proceeds to the bath, where hot and cold water,\r\nthe sanitary closet, a gas heater, and a great array of useful modern\r\narticles present themselves, such as vaseline, witch hazel, dentifrices,\r\ncold cream, soaps and antiseptics, which supply every luxurious want and\r\nevery modern conception of sanitation. His bath concluded, he proceeds\r\nto dress, and maybe puts in his false teeth, or straps on an artificial\r\nleg. Donning his shirt with patented gussets and bands, he quickly\r\nadjusts his separable cuff buttons, puts on his patented suspenders,\r\nand, winding a stem-winding watch, proceeds down stairs to breakfast. A\r\nrevolving fly brush and fly screens contribute to his comfort. A cup of\r\ncoffee from a drip coffee-pot, a lump of artificial ice in his tumbler,\r\nsausage ground in a machine, batter cakes made with an egg beater,\r\nwaffles from a patented waffle iron, honey in artificial honey comb,\r\ncream raised by a centrifugal skimmer, butter made in a patented churn,\r\nhot biscuits from the cooking range, and a refrigerator with a well\r\nstocked larder, all help to make him comfortable and happy. The picture\r\nis not exceptional in its fullness of invented agencies, and one could\r\njust as well go on with our citizen through the rest of the day’s\r\nexperience, and start him off after breakfast with a patented match, in\r\na patented match case, and a patented cigarette, with his patented\r\novershoes and umbrella, and send him along over the patented pavement to\r\nthe patented street car, or automobile, and so on to the end of the day.\r\n\r\nSome of the minor inventions are really of too much importance to be\r\npassed without comment. The _cable car_ is a factor which has cut no\r\nsmall figure in the activities of city life. The first patent on a\r\nslotted underground conduit between the rails, with traction cable\r\ninside and running on pulleys, was that to E. A. Gardner, No. 19,736,\r\nMarch 23, 1858. Hallidie, in San Francisco, in 1876, directed his\r\nenergies to a development of this system, and brought it to a degree of\r\nperfection and general adoption that made it for many years the leading\r\nsystem of street car propulsion. To-day, however, it represents but a\r\ndecadent type, being largely supplanted by the superior advantages of\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n_Passenger elevators_ constitute one of the conspicuous features of\r\nmodern locomotion. Without them the tall office buildings, hotels, and\r\ndepartment stores would have no existence; the Eiffel Tower would never\r\nhave been dreamed of, and the expenditure of vital force in stair\r\nclimbing would have been greatly augmented. The passenger elevator has\r\nfor its prototype the ancient hoist or lift for mines, but in the latter\r\nhalf of the Nineteenth Century it has developed into a distinct\r\ninstitution--a luxurious little room, gliding noiselessly up and down,\r\nactuated by a power that is not seen, and supplied with every appliance\r\nfor safety and comfort, such as governors, safety catches, automatic\r\nstops, mirrors and cushioned seats. The principle of the screw, of\r\nbalance weights, of the lazy tongs, and other mechanical powers have\r\neach found application in the elevator, but steam, hydraulic power, and\r\nelectricity constitute the moving agencies of the modern type. The\r\npatent to E. G. Otis, No. 31,128, January 15, 1861, marks the beginning\r\nof its useful applications.\r\n\r\nOf close kin to the elevator are the _fire escape_, _dumb waiter_ and\r\n_grain elevator_, each of which fills a more or less important function\r\nin the life of to-day.\r\n\r\nWhat more ubiquitous or ingenious illustration of modern progress than\r\nthe _American stem winding watch!_ Up to the middle of the century all\r\nwatches were made by hand throughout. Each watch had its own\r\nindividuality as a separate creation, and only the privileged few were\r\nable to carry them. In 1848 Aaron L. Dennison, a Boston watch maker,\r\nbegan making watches by machinery, and the foundation of the system of\r\ninterchangeable parts was laid. A small factory at Roxbury, Mass., was\r\nestablished in 1850, which four years later was moved to Waltham. In\r\n1857 it passed into the hands of Appleton, Tracy & Co., and was\r\nsubsequently acquired by the American Watch Co. As presenting some idea\r\nof the great elaboration involved in this art, it was estimated a few\r\nyears ago that 3,746 distinct mechanical operations were required to\r\nmake an ordinary machine made watch. A single pound of steel wire is\r\nsometimes converted into a couple of hundred thousand tiny screws, and\r\nanother pound of fine steel wire furnishes 17,280 hair springs, worth\r\nseveral thousand dollars. The absolute uniformity and perfect\r\ninterchangeability of parts in the American watch have been obtained by\r\nsubstituting the invariable and mathematical accuracy of the machine for\r\nthe nervous fingers and dimming eyes of the old time watchmaker, and the\r\nAmerican machine made watch, discredited as it was at first, stands\r\nto-day the greatest modern advance in horology.\r\n\r\n_Friction Matches._--In 1805 Thenard, of Paris, made the first attempt\r\nto utilize chemical agencies for the ordinary production of fire. In\r\n1827 John Walker, an English druggist, made friction matches called\r\n“congreves.” In 1833 phosphorus friction matches were introduced on a\r\ncommercial scale by Preschel, of Vienna. In 1845 red phosphorus matches\r\n(parlor matches) were made by Von Schrotter, of Vienna, and in 1855\r\nsafety matches, which ignited only on certain substances, were made by\r\nLundström, of Sweden. Prior to the Nineteenth Century, and in fact\r\nuntil about 1833, the old flint and steel and tinder box were the\r\nclumsy and uncertain means for producing fire. To-day the friction match\r\nis turned out by automatic machinery by the million, and constitutes\r\nprobably the most ubiquitous and useful of all the minor inventions.\r\n\r\nStep into any of the great department stores and the genius of the\r\ninventor confronts you in the _cash carrier_ whisking its little cars\r\nback and forth from the cashier’s desk to the most remote corners of the\r\ngreat building. The first of these mechanical carriers adapted for store\r\nservice was patented by D. Brown, July 13, 1875, No. 165,473. Not until\r\nabout 1882, however, was there any noticeable adoption of the system,\r\nwhen practical development was given in Martin’s patents, No. 255,525,\r\nMarch 28, 1882; No. 276,441, April 24, 1883, and No. 284,456, September\r\n4, 1883. Go to the lunch counter, and the _cash register_ reminds you\r\nthat the millenium of absolute honesty is not yet realized. The _bell\r\npunch_ on the street car and the burglar proof safe with its\r\n_combination locks_ are other suggestions in the same line. The first\r\n_fire proof safe_ is disclosed in the British patent to Richard Scott,\r\nNo. 2,477, of 1801. The _time lock_, which prevents the safe from being\r\nopened by anyone except at a certain period of daylight, was invented by\r\nJ. V. Savage, and was covered by him in United States patent No. 5,321,\r\nOctober 9, 1847. The practical adoption of time locks began about 1875\r\nwith the operations of Sargent, Stockwell and others, and to-day they\r\nconstitute one of the most important features of bank safes and vaults,\r\nand represent a marvelously beautiful and accurate example of mechanical\r\nskill.\r\n\r\nThe Otto _gas-engine_, and the Ericsson _air-engine_ are important\r\ndevelopments in power producing motors, and the improvements in\r\n_pavements_ and in _street sweepers_ for cleaning them, contribute to\r\nthe cleanliness, sanitation, and æsthetic values of city life. The\r\n_cigarette machine_, which continuously curls a ribbon of paper around a\r\ncore of tobacco to form a rope, and then cuts it off into cigarettes, is\r\nan important invention in the tobacco industry, however doubtful its\r\nhygienic value to the world may be. The _lightning rod_ has brought\r\nprotection to homes and lives, and the _incubator_ has become the hen’s\r\nwet nurse. In agriculture, the reaper has been supplemented with\r\nthreshing machines, seeders, drills, cultivators, horse rakes and plows.\r\nIn the farm yard appear the improved carriage and wagon, the well pump,\r\nthe wind wheel, the fruit drier, the bee hive, and the cotton and cider\r\npress. In the kitchen, the washing machine, the churn, the cheese press,\r\nironing machine, wringer, the rat trap, and fruit jar. In the house, the\r\nfolding bed, tilting chair, carpet sweeper, and the piano. In heating\r\nappliances, steam and water heating systems, base burning and Latrobe\r\nstoves, hot air furnaces, gas and oil stoves. In plastics there are\r\nbrick machines, pressed glass ware, enameled sheet iron ware, tiles,\r\npaper buckets, celluloid and rubber articles. In hydraulics there are\r\nrams, water closets, pumps, and turbine water wheels. In mining there\r\nare stamp mills, ore crushers, separators, concentrators, and\r\namalgamators. In the leather and boot and shoe industry there is a great\r\nvariety of machines and appliances. The paper industry, with book\r\nbinding machines, and paper box machines, is a fertile field of\r\ninvention. Steam boilers, metallurgical appliances, soap making,\r\nchemical fire extinguishers, fountain pens, the sand blast, bottle\r\nstoppers, and a thousand other things present themselves in\r\nmiscellaneous and endless array. These are, however, only some of the\r\nthings which the limitation of space precludes from individual\r\ntreatment, but which are none the less important in making up the great\r\nresources of modern life, and, for the most part, represent the\r\ncontributions of the Nineteenth Century not heretofore considered.\r\n\r\nThe observant and thoughtful reader finds just here occasion to inquire\r\nthe meaning of this great rising tide of progress which has so\r\ndistinguished the Nineteenth Century. It is largely due to the Patent\r\nLaw, which justly regards the inventor as a public benefactor, and seeks\r\nto make for him some protection in the enjoyment of his rights. If a man\r\nbe in the possession of a legacy by the accident of birth, the law of\r\ninheritance rules that it is rightfully his. The finding of a thing,\r\nwhether by jetsam, flotsam, or the lucky accident of a first discovery,\r\nthis also makes good his title, if there be no other owner. There is,\r\nhowever, a right of property which is higher than all others, and in\r\nwhich there is coupled with the possession of the thing the sacred\r\nfunction of its creation. The right of a mother to her child is of this\r\nnature, and like unto it is the right of the inventor to the creation of\r\nhis genius. In the last two centuries of the world’s history this right\r\nhas been recognized by an enlightened civilization, and provision made\r\nfor its enjoyment in the grant of patents, and if there be any right\r\nmore strongly entrenched than another in the eternal verities of equity\r\nand justice it is this. Our first crude patent law was enacted in 1790,\r\nbut not until 1836 was the present system adopted. Our own and\r\ncomparatively new country has, therefore, not yet had a hundred years of\r\nexistence under our present Patent System, and yet to-day it outstrips\r\nthe world both in its material resources and in its wealth of patented\r\ninventions. The accompanying diagram, Fig. 306, illustrates in a graphic\r\nway just what relation the United States bears to the other leading\r\ncountries of the world in the matter of patents granted, and when it is\r\nremembered that under our system a patent can only be granted for a new\r\ninvention, while in some of the other countries it is not essential to\r\nthe grant, the richness in invention of the United States, with its six\r\nhundred and fifty thousand patents, can be better appreciated. This is a\r\ngreater number than has been issued by Great Britain and France put\r\ntogether. Connecticut is the most productive State in invention in\r\nproportion to its people, and Edison is the most prolific inventor. From\r\n1870 to 1900 he has taken 727 United States patents, and there are from\r\ntwenty-five to thirty other American inventors each of whom has taken\r\n100 or more patents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOTAL NUMBER PATENTS TO JAN 1^{ST.} 1900\r\n\r\n(FOREIGN PATENTS FOR 1899, ESTIMATED)\r\n\r\nRATE OF ISSUE OF U.S. PATENTS\r\n\r\nFIG. 306.]\r\n\r\nThe year 1790 was notable in two events, the birth of our patent system\r\nand the death of Benjamin Franklin. That grand old philosopher, with a\r\nprescience of future greatness to come from the genius of the inventor,\r\nis said to have expressed the wish before he died that he might be\r\nsealed up in a cask of old Madeira and be brought to life a hundred\r\nyears in the future, that he might witness the growth of the world. Who\r\ncan tell what his emotions would be if he were with us to-day? It is\r\nsaid, when he first saw the fibres of the string diverge, and the spark\r\npass from the cord of his kite, and the lightning was for the first time\r\nobedient to the will of man, that he uttered a deep sigh and wished that\r\nthat moment were his last. To this poor knowledge of electricity he\r\nwould now have added all the wonders and powers of the telegraph, the\r\ndynamo, the telephone, and the great modern electrical science; to his\r\nprimitive hand press he would have contrasted the Octuple perfecting\r\npress, turning out papers at the rate of 1,600 a minute; his modest\r\ntype-setting case would be replaced by a great array of linotype\r\nmachines, and he would find several acres of woodland sacrificed to\r\nproduce the wood-pulp paper of a single edition of a New York daily.\r\nWould he not realize indeed that truth is stranger than fiction, and\r\nfact more wonderful than fancy’s dream!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever the future centuries may bring in new and useful inventions,\r\ncertain it is that the Nineteenth Century stands pre-eminent in this\r\nfield of human achievement, so far excelling all other like periods as\r\nto establish on the pages of history an epoch as remarkable as it is\r\nunique. Never before has human conception so expressed itself in\r\nmaterialized embodiment, never has thought been so fruitfully wedded to\r\nthe pregnant possibilities of matter, never has the divine function of\r\ncreation been so closely approximated, never has such an accretion of\r\nhelpful instrumentalities and material resources been added to the\r\nworld’s wealth--not merely the miserly and inert wealth of gold and\r\ngems, but the wealth of an enlarged human existence. This life itself is\r\nbut a limited span; beginning in infancy, expanding to highest\r\nachievement in middle age, and declining at the end, it quickly passes\r\naway, and another generation follows. Growth and decay with all living\r\nthings mark the immutable law of nature, and the inevitable fate of\r\nmortality. The rose blossoms into beauty, fades, and decays. The bird in\r\nthe air, and the beast in the field, each plays his part and passes to\r\nthe great unknown, leaving no record; man himself is mortal, but his\r\nwork is immortal. The inspired conception of his best thought, the\r\nmaterialized embodiment of his work in useful agencies, and the\r\nsubjugation of the laws of nature to his service, all endure and live\r\nforever in his inventions. These partake of the breath of life, and in\r\ntheir immortality are of kin to the soul. Cities may grow up and vanish,\r\ncivilizations may decay, and man himself may degenerate, but the\r\nprinciple of the lever and the screw, once discovered, is for all time\r\nperfect, invariable and immortal. Every invention made is another\r\npermanent gift to posterity. All of enduring wealth that the present\r\ngets from the past are its ideas reduced to a working basis. All else is\r\nbut dross, or evanescent dreams which vanish into oblivion in the light\r\nof a larger knowledge. But ideas wrought into practical, substantive\r\nthings, tried and proven true, these are inventions--immortal\r\ncreations--and of these the Nineteenth Century has borne fruit in\r\nparamount abundance, and this legacy it now bequeaths to the coming\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nTo follow conventional methods, the final chapter of a book should be an\r\n“In conclusion” with a “finis” and a dismantled torch, but the history\r\nof invention will ever be a continued story. There is no end in this\r\nfield. The trusteeship of the Twentieth Century man is great, and great\r\nhis responsibilities; but his restless and dominant spirit knows no\r\ndecadence, and his mental endowment and material equipment, without\r\nparallel in history, are a guarantee of future achievements. Will not\r\nthe chemist learn how to produce electricity direct from the combustion\r\nof coal, or solve the problem of the synthesis of food? Will not the\r\nAmerican continent be parted by an inter-oceanic canal, or the rough\r\nwaters of the English Channel be avoided with a submarine tunnel? May\r\nnot a ship canal through France to the Mediterranean give to that\r\ncountry the connected enjoyment of riparian rights, without passing the\r\nfrowning battlements of Gibraltar, or might not a tunnel under the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar put Europe and Africa in direct railway\r\ncommunication? The relation of electricity to life is a field of\r\npregnant possibilities, and may we not also learn to swap the surplus\r\nheat of summer for the winter’s cold, and by an equalization of their\r\ntwo extremes bring eternal spring and joy to the animated world? Shall\r\nwe not yet stand on the North Pole, or looking away into space may we\r\nnot extend a neighborly welcome to our brothers in Mars, if any there\r\nbe? It is permitted to dream in this field, for it is this reaching out\r\ninto the unknown that plats the boundaries of an extended world, and\r\nadds to the possessions of man.\r\n\r\nThe old man in his dreams of the past rejoices in his achievements, for\r\nhe has stolen the fires of Prometheus and forged anew the thunderbolts\r\nof Jove for the arts of peace. Delving into the secret recesses of the\r\nearth, he has tapped the hidden supplies of nature’s fuel, has invaded\r\nher treasure house of gold and silver, robbed Mother Earth of her\r\nhoarded stores, and possessed himself of her family record, finding on\r\nthe pages of geology sixty millions of years’ existence. Peering into\r\nthe invisible little world, the infinite secrets of microcosm have\r\nyielded their fruitful and potent knowledge of bacteria and cell growth.\r\nPain has been robbed of its terrors by anæsthesia; the heat of the sun\r\nhas been brought down in the electric furnace, and the cold of\r\ninter-stellar space in the ice machine and liquid air. With telescope\r\nand spectroscope he has climbed into limitless space above, and defined\r\nthe size, distance, and constitution of a star millions of miles away.\r\nThe north star has been made his sentinel on the sea. The lightning is\r\nmade his swift messenger, and thought flashes in submarine depths\r\naround the world. Dead matter is made to speak in the phonograph, the\r\ninvisible has been revealed in the X-Rays, coal has been made his black\r\nslave, steam the breath of the world’s life, and all of nature’s forces\r\nhave been made his constant servants in attendance.\r\n\r\nWith such a retrospect, the sage of the Nineteenth Century may lie down\r\nto quiet rest, with an assuring faith that what God hath wrought is\r\ngood, and what is not may yet be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abbe’s Stereo-Binocular, 289\r\n  Absorption Process, Ice Making, 441\r\n  Acetylene Gas, 333\r\n  Adirondack,

of “The Progress of Invention in the Nineteenth Century.”\r\nIt is, of course, well known that inventors are necessarily assisted in\r\nthe prosecution of their applications for patents in the Patent Office\r\nby patent attorneys. It gives Messrs, Munn & Co. pleasure to announce\r\nthat they have prosecuted, during a period of over fifty years, some of\r\nthe most important patent cases which have ever been sent to the Patent\r\nOffice. During this long period they have filed and prosecuted over one\r\nhundred thousand applications for patents. Their reputation is such that\r\ninventors have found that they may submit their ideas with entire\r\nconfidence that their trust will not be betrayed, and that their\r\ninterests will be protected to the fullest extent. They secure patents,\r\ntrade-marks, caveats and copyrights. A little book entitled “Hand-Book\r\non Patent Practice” will be sent free to any address, and any questions\r\nrelating to patents will be cheerfully answered by return mail without\r\ncharge. Thousands of clients all over the United States, many of them\r\nthe most successful inventors which this country has produced, have had\r\nthe professional services of Messrs. Munn & Co. in the preparation and\r\nprosecution of their patent applications before the United States and\r\nforeign patent offices. The integrity of this firm, and their attention\r\nto this branch of their business, has resulted in the largest practice\r\nof any firm of patent attorneys in the United States. Inventors are\r\ninvited to write freely regarding their inventions, and their sketches\r\nwill be carefully and promptly examined. All communications of this kind\r\nare treated as strictly confidential. The readers of “The Progress of\r\nInvention in the Nineteenth Century” may also be interested to know that\r\nMunn & Co. have offices in both New York and Washington, and thus are\r\nable to keep in close touch with the work of the Patent Office. They\r\nhave unsurpassed facilities for examining and reporting on the probable\r\npatent-ability of inventions, and they render opinions on questions of\r\ninfringement and validity of patents; and they also have been most\r\nsuccessful in the prosecution of interferences.\r\n\r\nFurther particulars may be obtained by addressing\r\n\r\nMUNN & CO.,\r\n\r\n  Branch Office:\r\n  625 F Street,\r\n  Washington, D.

In size and general make-up it is uniform therewith, covering\r\nsixteen pages of closely printed matter, handsomely illustrated. It has\r\nno advertising pages, and the entire space is given up to the\r\nscientific, mechanical and engineering news of the day. It differs from\r\nTHE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN in that it contains many articles that are too\r\nlong to be published in the older journal or of a more technical nature.\r\nCollege professors and students find this edition especially adapted to\r\ntheir wants. It contains reports of the meetings of the scientific\r\nsocieties, both in this country and abroad, and abstracts of many papers\r\nread before such societies. It has a page of short notes concerning the\r\nelectrical, engineering and general scientific news of the day, together\r\nwith a column of selected formulæ. Each number contains much foreign\r\nscientific news, and, when taken in connection with THE SCIENTIFIC\r\nAMERICAN, it places before the reader a weekly review of the latest and\r\nmost important discoveries and the most advanced technical and\r\nscientific work of the times all over the world.\r\n\r\nPRICE FOR THE SUPPLEMENT, $5 A YEAR, or one copy of THE SCIENTIFIC\r\nAMERICAN and one copy of SUPPLEMENT, both mailed to one address, for one\r\nyear, for $7.

Each number contains about forty large\r\nquarto pages, equal to about 200 ordinary book pages, forming,\r\npractically, a large and splendid MAGAZINE OF ARCHITECTURE, richly\r\nadorned with _elegant plates in colors_ and with fine engravings,\r\nillustrating the most interesting examples of modern architectural\r\nconstruction and allied subjects. A special feature is the presentation\r\nin each number of a variety of the latest and best plans for private\r\nresidences, city and country, including those of very moderate cost, as\r\nwell as the more expensive. Drawings in perspective and in color are\r\ngiven, together with plans, specifications, costs, etc. No other\r\nbuilding paper contains so many plans and specifications, regularly\r\npresented, as the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN. Thousands of dwellings have\r\nalready been erected on the various plans we have issued, and many\r\nothers are in process of construction.\r\n\r\nArchitects, builders and house owners will find this work valuable in\r\nfurnishing fresh and useful suggestions. All who contemplate building or\r\nimproving homes, or erecting structures of any kind, have before them in\r\nthis work an almost _endless series of the latest and best examples_\r\nfrom which to make selections, thus saving time and money.\r\n\r\nMany other subjects, including sewerage, piping, lighting, warming,\r\nventilating, decorating, laying out of grounds, etc., are illustrated.\r\nAn extensive Compendium of manufacturers’ announcements is also given,\r\nin which the most reliable and approved building materials, goods,\r\nmachines, tools and appliances are described and illustrated, with\r\naddresses of the makers, etc.\r\n\r\nThe fulness, richness, cheapness and convenience of this work have won\r\nfor it the _largest circulation_ of any architectural publication in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY NUMBER\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.\r\n\r\nIn commemoration of the fiftieth year of the publication of the weekly\r\nedition of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, its publishers on July 25th, 1896,\r\nissued a memorial edition which forms a valuable resumé of the progress\r\nof science and invention during the past fifty years.

Edison says:= “The practical character of the physical\r\napparatus, the clearness of the descriptive matter, and its entire\r\nfreedom from mathematics, give the work a value, in my mind, superior to\r\nany other work on elementary physics of which I am aware.”\r\n\r\nSend for Illustrated Circular and Complete Table of Contents.\r\n\r\n☛ Send for our New and Complete Catalogue of Books, sent free to any\r\naddress.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUNN & CO., Publishers.\r\n\r\n  SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN OFFICE,\r\n  361 Broadway, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN\r\n\r\nCyclopedia of Receipts\r\n\r\nNOTES AND QUERIES\r\n\r\n12,500 RECEIPTS, 708 PAGES\r\n\r\nEdited by ALBERT A.

H. PARSELL, Jr., Mem. A. I. Elec. El., and ARTHUR J. WEED,\r\nM. E.\r\n\r\nLarge 8vo. Handsomely Illustrated and Bound. 300 Pages. Price, $2.50.\r\n\r\nThis book treats of the subject more from the standpoint of practice\r\nthan that of theory. The principles of operation of Gas Engines are\r\nclearly and simply described, and then the actual construction of a\r\nhalf-horse power engine is taken up, step by step, showing in detail the\r\nmaking of a Gas Engine. First come directions for making the patterns;\r\nthis is followed by all the details of the mechanical operations of\r\nfinishing up and fitting the castings, and is profusely illustrated with\r\nbeautiful engravings of the actual work in progress, showing the modes\r\nof chucking, turning, boring and finishing the parts in the lathe, and\r\nalso plainly showing the lining up and erection of the engine.\r\nDimensioned working drawings give clearly the sizes and forms of the\r\nvarious details. The entire engine, with the exception of the\r\nfly-wheels, is designed to be made on a simple eight inch lathe, with\r\nslide rest. The book closes with a chapter on American practice in Gas\r\nEngine design, and gives simple rules so that anyone can figure out the\r\ndimensions of similar engines of other powers. Every illustration in\r\nthis book is new and original, having been made expressly for this work.\r\n\r\nSEND FOR DESCRIPTIVE CIRCULAR.\r\n\r\nMUNN & CO., Publishers,\r\n\r\n  SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN OFFICE\r\n  361 Broadway, New York\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Transcriber's notes\r\n\r\n  This text uses the text from the original work, including\r\n  inconsistencies in spelling, hyphenation, punctuation, etc., except as\r\n  mentioned below. The spelling of English (omniverous, millenium), non-\r\n  English words (licht, tuyeres, frappees) and names (Swammerden, Mege)\r\n  has not been corrected either, except as listed below.\r\n  Depending on the hard- and software and their settings used to read\r\n  this text, not all characters and symbols may display properly or\r\n  display at all.\r\n\r\n  Remarks on the text:\r\n  p. vii and 371: the list of contents lists Electric Concentrators, the\r\n  text deals with Magnetic Concentrators.\r\n  p. 171/172 (text of patent): one closing quote mark is missing.\r\n  p. 291, Swammerden: this refers to Jan Swammerdam (1637-1680).\r\n  p. 373, condicon: possibly error for condicion or a similar word.\r\n  p. 239, M. Mege, a French chemist: this refers to Hippolyte Mège-\r\n  Mouriès (1817-1880).\r\n  p. 408, Alte Deutscher Drehling Der Ruckladungs Gewehre: the reference\r\n  is to Alte Rückladegewehre: Alt-Deutscher Drehling.\r\n  p. 428, photograph: the chain of perforated cards is hardly visible in\r\n  the original work.\r\n  Index: the entries are not fully alphabetically sorted; this has not\r\n  been changed.\r\n  The order of subjects as given in the table of contents and in the\r\n  chapter headings is not always the order in which the text gives them;\r\n  the table of contents is sometimes slightly different from the chapter\r\n  headings; this has not been changed. The table of contents is not\r\n  complete: many subjects are not listed.\r\n  In several instances the author uses knots for distance and knots per\r\n  hour and feet for speed; this has not been changed.\r\n\r\n  Changes made:\r\n  Footnotes and illustrations have (where appropriate) been moved in\r\n  order not to interrupt the text.\r\n  Some obvious punctuation errors have been corrected silently.\r\n  If both ligature and single letters occur in the same word in the text\r\n  (with the exception of the advertisements), these have been\r\n  standardised: ae/æ to æ (anæsthetics); e/é to é (Carré, Lindé,\r\n  Niépce); oe/œ to œ (homœopathy, Phœnix).\r\n  The original work uses fractions of the form 1⁄2 as well as 15-16.\r\n  These have been standardised to x⁄y or changed to the appropriate\r\n  Unicode character.\r\n  p. v: Nitroglycerine changed to Nitro-Glycerine as elsewhere\r\n  p. vi, Chapter Photography: The Platinotype added as in the chapter\r\n  heading\r\n  p. 6: Kinetescope changed to Kinetoscope as elsewhere\r\n  p. 7: Hahneman changed to Hahnemann\r\n  p. 9: Perkin’s changed to Perkins’\r\n  p. 10: Rhumkorff changed to Ruhmkorff\r\n  p. 11: Foucalt changed to Foucault; Herman’s changed to Hermann’s\r\n  p. 15: ecomony changed to economy\r\n  p. 29: choking coils _k k_ changed to choking coils _k k′_ as in\r\n  illustration\r\n  p. 35: Gallilee changed to Galilee\r\n  p. 37: Somnenberg changed to Sonnenberg\r\n  p. 41: and other changed to and others\r\n  p. 47: corruscations changed to coruscations\r\n  p. 51: Badensburg changed to Bladensburg\r\n  p. 87: Chrstian Era changed to Christian Era\r\n  p. 88: Plante changed to Planté\r\n  p. 89: PLANTE changed to PLANTÉ (2x)\r\n  p. 92: commerical changed to commercial\r\n  p. 93: electrictiy changed to electricity; TROUVE’S changed to\r\n  TROUVÉ’S\r\n  p. 95: St. Petersburg changed to St. Petersburgh\r\n  p. 97: atached changed to attached\r\n  p. 98: whch changed to which\r\n  p. 105: colon in list of patents changed to comma (2x) as elsewhere\r\n  p. 108: Ninetenth Century changed to Nineteenth Century\r\n  p. 129: air-brake changed to air brake as elsewhere\r\n  p. 133: Pennsylvaina changed to Pennsylvania\r\n  p. 150: greater that changed to greater than\r\n  p. 153: for from changed to far from\r\n  p. 159: sterereotyping changed to stereotyping; Edinburg changed to\r\n  Edinburgh as elsewhere\r\n  p. 160: the the wire cloth changed to the wire cloth\r\n  p. 182: vearly changed to yearly\r\n  p. 188: Manufacturning changed to Manufacturing\r\n  p. 235: ilustrative changed to illustrative\r\n  p. 237: half a millions changed to half a million\r\n  p. 240: carry- a fractional per cent. changed to carrying a fractional\r\n  per cent.\r\n  p. 247: irresitable changed to irresistible\r\n  p. 248: acetanalide changed to acetanilide; OPHTHALMOMETER changed to\r\n  OPTHALMOMETER as elsewhere\r\n  p. 250: rationallen Heilkunde changed to rationellen Heilkunde\r\n  p. 253: bactilli changed to bacilli\r\n  p. 260: vélocipéde changed to vélocipède; celérifère changed to\r\n  célérifère\r\n  p. 261: vélocipéde changed to vélocipède\r\n  p. 265: Metiers changed to Métiers\r\n  p. 285: Middeburg, Middleburg changed to Middelburg\r\n  p. 301: Niepce's changed to Niépce's\r\n  p. 309: advertisment changed to advertisement\r\n  p. 324: currrent changed to current\r\n  p. 389: fire-arms changed to firearms as elsewhere\r\n  p. 395: must must changed to must\r\n  p. 401: Moncrief changed to Moncrieff\r\n  p. 412: Livermore-Russel changed to Livermore-Russell; Russel changed\r\n  to Russell\r\n  p. 416: pulvurulent changed to pulverulent\r\n  p. 425: effciency changed to efficiency\r\n  p. 462: latrobe stoves changed to Latrobe stoves\r\n  p. 469: Acetanalide changed to Acetanilide\r\n  p. 470: Cemementation changed to Cementation.",
